WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:09.205
The post artillery taking up the whole military 
wall. As soon as the

00:10.387 --> 00:32.620
commanders were in place, if there were any 
individual unit announcements to be made, then

00:10.387 --> 00:32.620
either the first sergeant or the commander would 
make that announcement. And you all had fallen out

00:33.022 --> 00:35.284
on military walk? Well, we lined up out there. 
Facing Sebesa? No, we lined up facing west. Oh,

00:43.934 --> 00:46.576
facing, oh, okay. We lined up facing west, and when 
we were ready, when everything was ready, the

00:46.596 --> 01:00.531
command, the regimental commander gave a 
command. had to be relayed down the way and

01:01.793 --> 01:12.468
everybody to the right place at the same time and 
step off at the same time. We normally never had the

01:12.488 --> 01:16.513
band with us. So we just marched and Sevesa fanned, 
the entrance to Sevesa was fanned into three

01:16.533 --> 01:29.691
entries and every unit had its place and after 
about the third day every student had his place.

01:38.866 --> 01:57.467
The normal setup was that the

01:38.866 --> 01:57.467
food, well a table was of a size you could have four 
There are four students on each side and one on each

01:59.523 --> 02:05.231
end. Totally ten. Normally, there'd be 
upperclassmen on one side and possibly the ends.

02:16.326 --> 02:19.430
Opposite then would be four freshmen. It was the 
freshmen. Now, the food was served in family style

02:20.411 --> 02:27.741
and sizable. bowls and platters, and served by 
student waiters. And it was all ready to go. Well,

02:39.106 --> 02:46.177
it was there almost within moments after the 
students came in and sat down. The job of the

02:46.618 --> 02:57.154
freshman was to see that every upperclassman at 
the table had his opportunity at whatever food

02:46.618 --> 02:57.154
there was. And they took it all up, and the 
president didn't get any, while the waiter was to

02:58.636 --> 03:07.505
go get some more and bring that. All that was done 
without any words or anything else. And it was, you

03:13.171 --> 03:20.958
know, it worked very well. Was there slang for the 
food then? Slang names? Oh, yeah. Share those with

03:26.304 --> 03:28.626
us, please. Well, bread with gun lighting.

03:43.113 --> 03:44.555
Let me think. Tea, coffee, tea, water, ketchup. 
Well, let me back up a little bit in my way. What I was

03:53.384 --> 03:57.929
about up to was the whole routine. Oh, okay. All 
right. As soon as L had been in the mess hall and as

03:59.048 --> 04:22.363
soon as there had been time for everyone to be 
served, then on the PA system,

03:59.048 --> 04:22.363
prior to that, there had been music of the day 
recordings on the PA system. But after everyone

04:22.383 --> 04:27.351
was in and ready and settled, then the PA

04:28.900 --> 04:43.380
announcer would come on the battalion, the team's 
hood, and he would read off whatever orders of the

04:28.900 --> 04:43.380
day there were. And in that day and time, it was a big 
deal to have a special delivery letter. And they

04:51.551 --> 04:56.798
always had them to breakfast.

04:57.841 --> 05:02.068
In fact, there's a guy named Graham Purcell, and 
they're so-called, everyone, every day.

05:03.189 --> 05:08.858
Everybody knew him by name, you know. And that 
would be the bulk of it. I just, man, I can't

05:17.031 --> 05:23.301
remember all the names for the clues, but I didn't 
get them. All right, what was your? Of the food, you

05:25.887 --> 05:32.573
recall, what were your favorites and your 
unfavorites as to tastiness?

05:35.596 --> 05:39.040
Well, to tell you the truth, I never had any trouble 
with any of it. Okay. It was all well done. It was

05:41.162 --> 05:44.325
well cooked, well served. The freshmen, the 
freshmen had to see that the upperclassmen got all

05:45.186 --> 05:49.990
they wanted. After that, the freshmen got what was 
left, which is ordinarily in there. Every

05:55.655 --> 06:10.434
place had two little quarter pounds of milk and a 
glass of water and a glass of milk. And it was

06:10.454 --> 06:20.447
generally

06:10.454 --> 06:20.447
customary

06:10.454 --> 06:20.447
that once the meal had been finished by the 
upperclassmen or the freshmen could do what they

06:22.975 --> 06:35.627
called a meal handing, which was to go and gather up 
the milk or whatever it was that they wanted. At

06:36.508 --> 06:51.762
breakfast that was all from the cereal, but the 
cereal came in the little individual

06:36.508 --> 06:51.762
package

06:36.508 --> 06:51.762
boxes. At noon also The one big item that had its own 
name was kush, as dessert, which ordinarily was a

06:53.232 --> 07:05.063
pie, pies. For ten boys, there'd be three pies, 
three pies on each table. And each pie was always

07:14.453 --> 07:19.037
only cut One slice across one way and 90 degrees in 
that was the other way. Always in four pieces.

07:29.813 --> 07:31.395
Never any different. So there were 12 pieces for 10 
people. Well, it was there on the table. That's

07:36.882 --> 07:38.544
what I mean. But that way the upperclassmen could 
get what they want. But until after Thanksgiving

07:42.048 --> 07:46.594
or Thanksgiving year, Well, the freshmen never 
did get any kush, except what was left over after

07:47.249 --> 07:55.961
all the rest of them

07:47.249 --> 07:55.961
had left. And, uh, the, uh,

07:55.981 --> 08:10.541
anybody that didn't get enough to eat, well, you 
could, after the upperclassmen were gone, well,

07:55.981 --> 08:10.541
they could go and roam, and that was called meal 
handling. Uh, kush, uh, Tell

08:13.422 --> 08:23.674
me then from, let's start it after breakfast. 
Describe a typical weekday, class day. Well. Got

08:29.400 --> 08:30.281
up at what time? Reveille. Well, Reveille was at 
6.15.

08:38.250 --> 08:42.855
And the vehicle blew it up outside and So you knew 
you had to get up and get your rims straightened up

08:43.679 --> 08:51.787
and get your toes on. And those days, I don't think 
any of us worried about shaving. And he was ready to

08:58.234 --> 09:06.323
go out at 5 to 7 for formation. And we'd go, and after 
the meal, In our case, we ate in Spiegel. So there

09:15.378 --> 09:24.251
was time to go down to the post office where each of 
us could order them. We had a box to share. And then

09:26.954 --> 09:34.405
we could get back to our room. And if we had an 8 
o'clock class, we'd go and get ready until it was 8

09:34.425 --> 09:40.213
o'clock. or there was later, we'd go back to the 
room and study or mock around or whatever we were

09:40.784 --> 09:54.136
going to do. There never was any big deal of 
pressure or pushing around

09:54.156 --> 10:01.723
or anything like that. If some freshman had not 
done something to some of the freshmen's favor,

10:11.412 --> 10:24.529
The only time something would happen about that 
would be the latter part of the morning or in the

10:11.412 --> 10:24.529
afternoon or

10:11.412 --> 10:24.529
in the evening. The mornings generally went 
pretty much business like. Now you fell out into

10:29.356 --> 10:34.503
formation for breakfast and for supper, is that 
right? Oh and for lunch also.

10:41.973 --> 10:48.322
Now, the same routine went on for breakfast and 
lunch. But for dinner, we had the retreat

10:50.726 --> 11:02.603
formation.

11:02.624 --> 11:06.589
And generally, it consisted of to the color as the 
flag was lowered. And we could hear the band across

11:07.611 --> 11:11.777
the campus when we started playing. Now, normally 
the band would be playing where? Well, I don't know

11:15.686 --> 11:29.483
where they were before I got there, but all the time 
I was there, the band played in the center area of

11:15.686 --> 11:29.483
what at that time was known as the New Dome. The New 
Dome, all right. I guess you'd say out front of the

11:30.965 --> 11:33.408
Dome. Okay. And then when you all had core drills, 
when were they held?

11:41.947 --> 11:48.035
And about how often?

11:49.297 --> 12:03.015
Well, there would be a, it was not unusual,

11:49.297 --> 12:03.015
430, like, somewhere in there, for each outfit to 
have their own grip. That would be when the

12:03.095 --> 12:09.844
freshmen are lined up to how to fall in, how to. do 
right and left face,

12:10.651 --> 12:20.424
how to

12:10.651 --> 12:20.424
march, what to do. And sometimes we'd just march 
around until we hit them. And where would you all

12:24.569 --> 12:26.232
normally do that? Military wall. Right close to 
the gun. Core drill, as such,

12:39.288 --> 12:49.564
Well, it was up to each, you know,

12:39.288 --> 12:49.564
the chain of command set up for that. Because the 
Corps commander, he ran the show, then there were

12:51.207 --> 13:05.970
the Residential Commanders, then there were the 
Battalion Commanders, then there were the Unit

12:51.207 --> 13:05.970
Commanders. There never was anything except 
everybody would fall out at x time and do less and so

13:06.727 --> 13:23.863
on, unless it was like four or a year.

13:23.883 --> 13:28.828
I really would differentiate between that time 
and now. There was a lot less pressure on any

13:29.628 --> 13:35.314
individual. But I never did that. We all knew that 
we had a certain amount of hazing to do, whether it

13:37.034 --> 13:58.306
was holding up the wall or push-ups or duck walking

13:37.034 --> 13:58.306
or knee bends. You said that no board until after 
Thanksgiving. What would a board be used for after

14:02.653 --> 14:06.298
that? You've certainly heard of the use of a board 
in hazing

14:07.190 --> 14:23.934
to

14:07.190 --> 14:23.934
the hazing process with the board. Who could use 
the board? Well, of course, the seniors could do

14:26.457 --> 14:30.783
whatever they wanted to. Juniors followed, and 
then... Depending on the status of, by that I mean,

14:35.962 --> 15:02.948
the behavior, the overall

14:35.962 --> 15:02.948
well-being or well-acting of the freshman or the 
sophomore, it was a stair-step,

14:35.962 --> 15:02.948
you might say, permission and nobody was to get 
hurt and so the

15:05.746 --> 15:33.745
procedure was the cadet, if the board was going to 
be applied, the word was grab a pooch and the boy

15:05.746 --> 15:33.745
would grab his and at the same time flex the muscles 
in his buttocks so that he really, after a little

15:34.872 --> 15:50.447
bit, he got to where he is in pretty strong steel 
back there. And as a result, after a little bit,

15:51.228 --> 16:03.900
some of the more dashing freshmen would aggravate 
the upperclassmen just so he'd try it again.

16:04.387 --> 16:22.825
Because if the striking

16:04.387 --> 16:22.825
person got out of a thin band right across the 
center of the buttocks, why, he was called for a

16:04.387 --> 16:22.825
shit leg. And the offended got to retaliate. And 
that kind of kept things in focus. Tell me about,

16:33.766 --> 16:38.793
and we're talking about before the war, because 
I'll bet things were different after the war.

16:39.533 --> 16:45.741
Before you left for the war, tell me about some of 
the jokes, the pranks, the good bull that you knew

16:39.533 --> 16:45.741
about.

16:48.665 --> 17:00.060
Were there anything that you or others did that 
would,

16:48.665 --> 17:00.060
for fun, that were pranks, jokes, good bulls? 
Well, I got two of them that I participated in. Let

17:06.429 --> 17:08.051
me hold off on that one. Oh, okay. Have you heard 
about the

17:11.074 --> 17:21.624
authority of the upper class and senior class and 
how they exercised it in 1940? No, tell me about it,

17:23.165 --> 17:24.727
please. Well, in the month of December 1940,

17:31.192 --> 17:36.199
The school was hit with a massive outbreak of the 
flu. And they was over at the infirmary while they

17:37.981 --> 17:46.553
had kids laying on the floor. It was all over the 
place. And they told them to stay in your room and do

17:48.055 --> 17:51.179
this. You know, it was really a terrible epidemic. 
And so a week before ordinary times, leave for

18:01.465 --> 18:12.736
Christmas, the senior class met and said, we're 
going home.

18:12.756 --> 18:16.960
And they released, they released school and 
everybody went home a full week early. And that

18:19.402 --> 18:28.711
kind of gives you an idea of the way that school was 
run and the authority of the senior class. There

18:29.772 --> 18:30.713
are also But a couple

18:31.013 --> 18:43.947
things

18:31.013 --> 18:43.947
happened.

18:45.148 --> 18:58.002
My job was a janitor

18:45.148 --> 18:58.002
in the library.

18:58.022 --> 19:00.244
And it was in the book stacks back in the back. I 
never got out on the front porch.

19:05.161 --> 19:19.455
Parenthetically, one of the reasons I never did 
smoke was because out in the reading area is why the

19:05.161 --> 19:19.455
rack of the day was spitting old and dull dirt. And 
that rarely got extinguished while we were there.

19:25.241 --> 19:27.463
And I had all of that that I wanted, but I 
Fortunately, I didn't have to put up with much of

19:27.882 --> 19:32.989
it, but I never cared for any smoking ever in my 
life. So they could smoke in the library. Yeah.

19:39.558 --> 19:46.687
But the thing that attracted my attention on that 
job in the library was in the stacks. Well, that's

19:47.328 --> 19:49.751
where all the trash was put. And they had a couple of 
real, several real models, one of which was a tow

19:51.133 --> 19:56.961
sack. I'd always thought a toesight might be four 
or five feet long. Here's some that were ten feet

20:03.624 --> 20:09.731
long. Or more. And the next thing I noticed was that 
the

20:11.273 --> 20:23.328
library lighting had some bulbs that were about 
the size of a basketball. And they had some others

20:24.589 --> 20:28.534
that were maybe down to the size of a volleyball. 
Well, they burned out and so the guys that were

20:29.594 --> 20:37.645
working that part of the library took them out and 
they put them in the trash and the trash came out in

20:29.594 --> 20:37.645
my area. And I began to sort of dream about what 
could happen to those over there next to the

20:38.987 --> 20:48.340
houses. So I collected and collected and 
collected. I had about three of those, two or three

20:52.746 --> 20:58.133
full of those big bugs. And I got three of my 
roommates and a couple

20:59.176 --> 21:09.806
of other guys. And during the final exam in the 
spring of 41, we went over to the library and

21:10.026 --> 21:23.659
gathered up my tow sacks and took them back. And all 
the way up to the fourth floor of Mitchell, And

21:27.678 --> 21:39.328
there was a small trap door in the shower room, but 
we managed to get up there and get all these sacks

21:27.678 --> 21:39.328
through there. And, oh, about 1230 in the morning, 
while we stated ourselves strategically around

21:39.349 --> 21:57.685
the periphery of the roof, and then when we decided 
time to go, we just lulled these They drove over the

21:58.019 --> 22:00.422
side. They dropped four floors, boom, boom, boom, 
boom, boom, boom, you know, and just kept it up. And

22:10.352 --> 22:17.980
then every two of them came from the same place, and 
the old business, you know, hollering, yelling,

22:10.352 --> 22:17.980
cut it out, cut it out. They were screaming bloody 
murder down below, and they didn't know anything

22:18.100 --> 22:25.528
about it. Did you get caught? About who it was? No. 
We just kept going until we ran out of bugs and of

22:30.599 --> 22:45.274
course about the time there were several, several 
of them tried to send me up the scale of the wall and

22:30.599 --> 22:45.274
you know that you can cure that by just landing on 
close by. So we kept that up and it I guess we carried

22:51.277 --> 22:54.860
that on for 30, 45 minutes. It was something else. 
We waited over an hour and quietly went down one at a

22:57.863 --> 23:04.609
time. Now, and you and the other bombers were all 
freshmen?

23:13.738 --> 23:13.938
Yeah. And then another one was the... In

23:22.175 --> 23:32.206
the mess hall, of course, we got these little 
individual cereal boxes. And this sort of a game to

23:32.226 --> 23:36.350
collect them up. Food was hard to come by in the 
dorms. We, of course, were only about 75 feet from

23:42.396 --> 23:48.823
Casey's, a confectioner there. in the bottom of 
the YMCA there. It was hardly an eating place.

23:55.935 --> 24:00.541
You'd get a milkshake or a lot of milk there, but 
that's not all. Anyway, we collected these boxes.

24:06.608 --> 24:19.063
And we had a good bunch of them, and it got to be warm 
weather, and ground out time became, you know, And

24:19.853 --> 24:31.029
my good friend from Fort Worth, he lived directly 
below, and he had a roommate from Dallas. Well,

24:31.049 --> 24:45.971
over time, we had washed our socks in the lavatory 
in our room, and the water pipe wasn't sealed at the

24:31.049 --> 24:45.971
floor as a lot of them are in those times. And if we 
slopped a little water over it, run down the pipe

24:49.469 --> 24:59.500
and there was a joint just, I don't know, let the 
water run down that pipe and splatter. It would

25:00.681 --> 25:12.995
get all over their room and so forth. And they 
didn't really appreciate it. We weren't really

25:16.759 --> 25:18.261
trying to be Well, they got kind of contentious

25:18.697 --> 25:27.949
after a while. So, my friend from Fort Worth, he'd 
stick his head out in

25:28.710 --> 25:48.535
the, in the uh, in the uh, in the uh, in the uh, in the 
uh, in the uh, in the uh, in the uh, in the uh, in the

25:28.710 --> 25:48.535
uh, in the uh, in the uh, in the uh, by any time 
anything like that happened while we were all

25:49.105 --> 25:54.514
dried up. But finally we decided maybe it would be a 
good idea to get rid of all that cereal. So we took

26:04.171 --> 26:14.269
two wastebaskets and went into the shower and 
filling up with water. It happened that the water

26:18.366 --> 26:20.248
wasn't exactly cold.

26:23.112 --> 26:27.697
We got a hold of some of the warm water. But anyway, 
we filled up these two place passes. And so we went

26:31.362 --> 26:45.859
down and after they'd gone to sleep down below us, 
well, we went down and went in and took the going out

26:31.362 --> 26:45.859
boat. very politely lifted on the dressing. We 
took the doorknob off and that's it. And then we

26:52.203 --> 27:01.419
simultaneously, one bucket full on the upper bunk 
and one bucket full on the lower bunk, slammed the

26:52.203 --> 27:01.419
door and took off. And we had to go down to the second 
floor and up to the fourth one, which we did. Well,

27:08.991 --> 27:11.796
we They came up, came in our room and felt the bottom 
of our feet to see if there was any dirt on them. And

27:30.725 --> 27:33.990
we didn't find any. So we went away, drunk

27:34.010 --> 27:41.260
and mad. the principal character in that thing. He 
didn't find it out until I made a mistake telling it

27:46.721 --> 27:53.150
at a reunion about five years ago. Now, and the 
victim was a sophomore? No, he was a freshman too.

27:57.596 --> 27:58.418
Oh, a freshman also. Oh, okay. So you play, it was a 
good bull of one fish on another fish. Yeah.

28:08.352 --> 28:08.733
Let's see. Tell me about some of the special... 
teachers, advisors, who were some of the folks in

28:12.273 --> 28:19.683
your A&M years that really were special to you? 
Well, number one has to be Dr. J.G.H. Thompson. Did

28:27.192 --> 28:28.133
he have a nickname? Alphabet.

28:33.540 --> 28:39.428
He later was considered to be the father of the F-16 
aircraft because of the designers and

28:40.353 --> 28:52.611
the principal, people who developed the F-16, all 
their students. And one of them, my good friend and

28:55.155 --> 29:07.153
classmate, Terrence Hart, who was in charge of 
that whole

28:55.155 --> 29:07.153
thing. Adrian Breeland was in the military. He was 
a wonderful guy and coached

29:12.823 --> 29:26.101
artillery. Math, English, history?

29:32.249 --> 29:37.056
Well, in the curricula at that time, those were all 
sort of odd items to us. Frankly, I didn't find any

29:41.923 --> 29:49.289
stellar

29:41.923 --> 29:49.289
documentation on him. Who was the Dean of 
Engineering? Ed Gilchrist. He was great. He was a

29:55.114 --> 29:56.776
really wonderful man. When it came time to call us 
to war, he did his best to give us time to get a degree

29:59.138 --> 30:07.785
before we were called in. What were the normal 
either written or assumed rules about class and

30:08.862 --> 30:21.554
attendance and conduct in class?

30:25.738 --> 30:38.110
Well,

30:25.738 --> 30:38.110
attendance, you were allowed What

30:39.389 --> 31:09.345
role

30:39.389 --> 31:09.345
did the YMCA play then in student life? the 
organization and or the building? Well the

31:14.193 --> 31:19.483
organization,

31:14.193 --> 31:19.483
I can't give them credit for anything. Because 
there wasn't MSC then so. But the biggest thing is
