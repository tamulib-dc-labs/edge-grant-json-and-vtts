WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:05.378
There was a question about having a kidney problem that I did not have.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.327
It developed, but the Army didn't think so.

00:09.149 --> 00:16.150
And because of my eyes and that, I was 4F.

00:17.665 --> 00:33.569
And in med school, this is sort of unrelated to A&M, but I joined the Naval Reserve and applied for an active duty at the end of the time in med school and failed their physical again.

00:33.589 --> 00:35.151
And so when I was an intern,

00:35.131 --> 00:38.835
I then applied for the Army.

00:39.836 --> 00:47.124
And so I was taken to a room and told to take my shirt off, and I sat on the examining table.

00:47.144 --> 00:51.168
And the doctor walked in, and that time I had my degree to be an intern.

00:51.609 --> 00:52.810
So he said, oh, you're a doctor.

00:53.130 --> 00:53.671
I said, yes.

00:53.891 --> 00:55.533
He said, is there anything wrong with you?

00:55.553 --> 00:56.894
I said, no.

00:56.914 --> 00:58.516
He said, put your shirt back on.

01:00.078 --> 01:01.459
So I became an Army doctor.

01:05.455 --> 01:07.618
Let's see.

01:08.840 --> 01:22.659
So you didn't go through final review, and... I can remember the final review when I was a freshman, because we stood at attention some time.

01:23.179 --> 01:24.541
The unit's all masked, you know.

01:25.763 --> 01:30.349
And I can remember the big guys in my unit fainted.

01:30.329 --> 01:36.660
Because when you stand rigidly for so long, something happens to your vasculature.

01:36.978 --> 01:39.040
And it was the big guys who fainted.

01:40.382 --> 01:45.086
Now, wasn't it about your freshman year or so that Eisenhower came to the campus?

01:45.607 --> 01:46.087
Yes.

01:46.107 --> 01:50.092
I think it was 1947 for graduation, I believe, or something.

01:50.112 --> 01:58.540
I know he spoke, I think it was graduation, or it may have been the induction of a new president or something.

01:59.061 --> 02:01.303
What impression did that make on a young undergraduate?

02:01.363 --> 02:03.085
Well, he was in summer uniform.

02:03.145 --> 02:05.888
I remember that.

02:05.868 --> 02:09.360
a handsome military officer.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.648
And it was, yes, it was impressive.

02:13.876 --> 02:16.806
Was anything made of the fact that he was a native-born Texan?

02:18.507 --> 02:27.202
I don't know that too much was made of that fact because as a, having grown up in Kansas, he more or less said he was from Kansas, you know.

02:27.863 --> 02:30.968
So I don't know that that was overemphasized to his face.

02:31.790 --> 02:40.785
He was teaching in Denison in 1952-53, the year he's elected, and according to the story we heard there,

02:41.103 --> 02:46.854
that he didn't know he had actually been born in Denison, that he had thought he'd been born in Tyler.

02:47.475 --> 02:54.768
But his older brother Milton said, no, you were born there and we moved to Tyler about a few weeks later.

02:54.788 --> 02:58.275
So that probably was on his records that he was born in Tyler, I guess.

02:58.295 --> 02:58.735
Let's see.

02:59.196 --> 03:00.158
Silver Taps.

03:01.741 --> 03:13.674
Yes, a young man, last name B-R-E-D-T, died in an auto accident when I was a member of my unit.

03:14.675 --> 03:16.597
And I remember that very well.

03:18.419 --> 03:26.327
We formed more or less, I guess, in front of Lawrence Sullivan Ross's statue, or adjacent to it.

03:27.448 --> 03:31.292
And it was an evening, sort of cold.

03:31.272 --> 03:35.398
The dark and silver taps and so forth, yeah.

03:35.418 --> 03:38.663
And did the buglers come out on the pile?

03:39.104 --> 03:39.684
I think so.

03:40.446 --> 03:42.889
I remember the bugle more than the location of the bugler.

03:44.251 --> 03:51.081
Did, were you, as a fish, were you part of a polishing crew on the statue?

03:51.101 --> 03:54.867
I didn't have that honor.

03:54.847 --> 04:04.542
In fact, I've, of course, living here, I've been seeing the statue many times, but I think it's better polished in the last 20 years than it was back in New Orleans.

04:04.562 --> 04:05.263
Five years, too.

04:05.283 --> 04:16.841
In fact, some of these traditions you hear about were, as E. E. McQuillan, who had the former students said, a tradition is something that has occurred for four years, you know?

04:16.861 --> 04:21.428
Now, Mr. Rudder, I remember him chuckling about Prexy's Moon.

04:21.408 --> 04:22.029
Yeah.

04:22.129 --> 04:26.835
That light bulb that used to be a, and that, and when he was an undergraduate, it was.

04:26.855 --> 04:27.456
They'd shoot it.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.657
They'd shoot it.

04:28.677 --> 04:30.780
Yeah, when there was a commandant, they would shoot it too.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.561
Is that right?

04:31.581 --> 04:31.881
Yeah.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.244
Was it being done when you were in the Corps?

04:35.366 --> 04:43.356
I think at that point, that had, I think the war changed things enough so that I don't remember people, that didn't fade it out by then.

04:43.777 --> 04:47.121
Was muster held, do you remember muster in those days?

04:47.521 --> 04:47.601
Yes.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.442
Where was it held?

04:48.903 --> 04:51.246
Yeah, I'm trying to think.

04:53.369 --> 04:59.016
I think it was in the stadium, I believe, yeah.

05:01.840 --> 05:02.921
But it was held, yes.

05:03.642 --> 05:06.225
What did those muster?

05:06.245 --> 05:16.238
You know, one thing, as a student, that's more a former student function, and we were aware of that more than, but not so much as a student, yeah.

05:16.657 --> 05:24.507
What role do those events play, muster and silver taps and bonfire and so forth, play in creating Aggie spirit?

05:29.173 --> 05:37.123
I think the bonfire and silver taps, I think they both had an yell practice too.

05:39.566 --> 05:46.495
They really made you feel part of the A&M family.

05:46.475 --> 05:53.063
And not everything was just a lot of fun.

05:53.083 --> 06:00.071
I mean, you know, if you're at Yale practice and you're a freshman, somebody's over six inches from your ear yelling, yell louder.

06:00.511 --> 06:05.337
I mean, at the time, that's not, but in retrospect, it sort of is special.

06:06.258 --> 06:11.824
And I can remember Bill Eccles and I were detailed in our whole outfit.

06:11.804 --> 06:14.030
if matter, to guard the bonfire.

06:14.090 --> 06:18.001
And our duty was sort of from midnight till six in the morning or something.

06:19.044 --> 06:21.451
And then it was, you know, horrible weather.

06:21.892 --> 06:26.826
You know, cold and windy and wet and everything.

06:26.806 --> 06:36.735
And one of us had a raincoat, the other had a poncho, and so we put the poncho, or maybe the raincoat down, and then the poncho sort of over us.

06:36.755 --> 06:49.166
And one of us would sleep while the other, we were theoretically watching out for University of Texas marauders, but the one who was awake would be watching to see if the upperclassmen were coming around to check us.

06:49.746 --> 06:56.492
And then he would wake the one who was asleep, wake up the one who was asleep, you know, and then both of us would look alert, you know.

06:56.945 --> 06:57.966
But I mean, things like that.

06:57.986 --> 07:01.309
And I can remember we had to guard the stadium once.

07:01.329 --> 07:05.813
Apparently Rice had threatened to come up and throw some paint on it or something.

07:05.873 --> 07:16.523
And I recall that I decided that, being a freshman, I don't know how I had any decision to make.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.965
But anyway, I got the press box.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.107
And the press box was not as it is today.

07:21.127 --> 07:21.727
It was open.

07:22.588 --> 07:26.952
But it was about the safest place in the stadium, I'd say.

07:26.932 --> 07:30.076
But I could, I guess, see things better than everybody else.

07:31.458 --> 07:37.467
Aggie ring, do you remember that being a special thing?

07:37.487 --> 07:39.289
Oh yes, everybody got an Aggie ring.

07:39.309 --> 07:41.312
Now you notice I don't have one on.

07:41.332 --> 07:46.118
My ring went to the bottom, fell off in the Gulf of Mexico.

07:46.679 --> 07:49.463
The rings were, I got the biggest kind.

07:49.443 --> 07:58.795
It was heavy enough so when your hand was wet with water or soap, particularly soap, it could slip off in the shower or something.

07:59.897 --> 08:06.546
Unfortunately, one time it slipped off when I was swimming in the Gulf when I was in med school.

08:06.566 --> 08:17.340
As a physician, before each operation or delivery or even just your office, you're always washing your hands and particularly in surgery.

08:17.894 --> 08:21.940
you have to take your rings off, or your ring off, as well as your watch.

08:22.961 --> 08:28.790
And so at that point, when I lost that, I didn't get another one.

08:28.810 --> 08:35.820
And after the watch I had stopped working, I never wore a wrist watch after that.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.120
Really?

08:37.402 --> 08:37.963
Bonfire.

08:37.983 --> 08:40.206
Where was Bonfire held in your student days?

08:40.878 --> 08:43.723
The bonfire was held on what is called Simpson Field.

08:44.103 --> 08:45.105
On the drill field.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.247
Uh-huh, yeah.

08:46.267 --> 08:53.298
And the drill field west of, north of where the Memorial Student Center is today.

08:53.739 --> 08:55.642
What did, what was put into it?

08:55.762 --> 08:58.026
What were the, what was burned up?

08:58.006 --> 09:03.011
mainly trees, tree trunks.

09:05.773 --> 09:15.783
My father, that was one of the things that actually he had something to do with changing.

09:17.524 --> 09:25.532
In the early 1930s, the bonfire consisted of anything anybody could find, which meant

09:26.170 --> 09:38.485
woodsheds and outhouses and that era of that sort of plumbing, and our fence on, you know, faculty members' fence or something.

09:38.685 --> 09:45.293
And because the kids didn't have transportation the way they do now, and the bonfire was much smaller than it is.

09:45.854 --> 09:48.617
So you're saying in the mid-30s that shift

09:49.036 --> 10:09.604
Yes, and so I can remember going out to a log cabin which was catty-cornered across the street from the southeast part of the campus, where now Texas Avenue and George Bush Boulevard intersect.

10:10.065 --> 10:14.851
And at the part catty-cornered across the street from the campus, there was a log cabin.

10:14.871 --> 10:15.432
I remember that.

10:17.015 --> 10:23.205
And the dad being the commandant was, of course, called on when somebody was irate about the students.

10:23.926 --> 10:27.251
And the guy had walked over and had removed his outhouse.

10:28.834 --> 10:33.761
And he got his outhouse back before the fire burned it up.

10:34.062 --> 10:37.347
But everything was just fair game as far as that goes.

10:37.367 --> 10:39.951
And so what dad did, he...

10:39.931 --> 10:55.535
Some of the land west of the campus, on the west campus, more or less where the George Bush Library is now, and back toward the Penberthy mural area, some of that land needed to be cleared for agricultural reasons.

10:55.555 --> 11:02.125
So he arranged for the students to have the right to cut the timber.

11:02.105 --> 11:03.186
By hand?

11:03.907 --> 11:04.849
I'm sure.

11:04.869 --> 11:06.090
I imagine so.

11:07.672 --> 11:21.410
Anyway, they sort of indicated you would not steal somebody's personal property anymore, but they gave them something to replace it with.

11:23.373 --> 11:28.399
One of the interesting things is that after I came back here to practice, which was 1964,

11:28.379 --> 11:36.452
That fall, before our house was built, we were living in mother and dad's house, and they were out at their place at Camp Crete.

11:38.015 --> 11:47.029
A telephone call came from one of the older people in Bryan, two sisters, major landowners.

11:47.009 --> 12:00.829
And they thought I was Dad, so they said, Colonel Anderson, if you'd like to have the students come out to one of our places to cut timber, we'd like for you to have them come out.

12:00.849 --> 12:01.570
This was 1964.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.656
Dad had stepped down his commandant in 1937.

12:07.479 --> 12:08.460
But anyway.

12:08.440 --> 12:13.516
Other people off campus began to make available trees and so forth.

12:13.536 --> 12:16.144
I guess some foreign transportation became available.

12:16.685 --> 12:22.483
So anyway, it shifted from being sort of personal property to timber.

12:22.953 --> 12:29.405
Did you know of any student fraternities, secret fraternities in existence at that point?

12:29.425 --> 12:34.413
There was one I think called True Texans or something, and maybe another.

12:34.714 --> 12:37.619
But I was not a member of that.

12:37.639 --> 12:39.703
What did they, what was their goal?

12:39.843 --> 12:42.548
What was their purpose?

12:42.528 --> 12:49.116
I only know second-hand, but I have the impression they wanted to maintain the traditions of the past, basically.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.781
But beyond that, I don't know too much.

12:53.662 --> 13:05.717
As far as I'm aware, that they hope to elect their members to keep things going in a certain direction, like you're saying, to uphold the tradition.

13:05.697 --> 13:12.825
Now, the Ross Volunteers were, you know, a known organization, and I'm sure that a lot of them were members of that.

13:13.366 --> 13:26.400
And that was basically, as you know better probably than I, served in various sort of formal capacities and associated with events and so on.

13:26.901 --> 13:30.405
Was there a formal pre-med organization?

13:30.385 --> 13:32.449
When I was a student, yes, there was.

13:32.850 --> 13:34.995
Who was its advisor?

13:35.015 --> 13:35.355
Dr. Gravett?

13:35.556 --> 13:37.620
Dr. Well, Dr. Potter was.

13:37.881 --> 13:38.763
Oh, okay.

13:38.783 --> 13:48.563
When I was a student, then as he became less healthy and retired, then Dr. Gravett was that, and he was that for, I'm sure, at least 20 years.

13:48.543 --> 13:52.871
What was A&M's reputation in those days for getting students into medical school?

13:52.891 --> 13:54.414
It was excellent.

13:54.434 --> 14:00.466
Now, there were not a lot of premeds at A&M, but there were really two reasons for that.

14:00.967 --> 14:08.121
One was that the emphasis of A&M was so much in other directions, but the other was that

14:08.101 --> 14:16.293
that not many people got past the sophomore year of pre-med through Dr. Potter's course.

14:16.313 --> 14:20.479
And if they did, they almost uniformly got in medical school.

14:21.480 --> 14:21.941
Now, let's see.

14:21.981 --> 14:27.929
In those days, the only medical schools in the state were in Galveston and Baylor in Houston.

14:27.949 --> 14:29.331
And Southwestern in Dallas.

14:29.351 --> 14:30.333
Oh, I forgot Southwestern.

14:30.353 --> 14:30.593
Three.

14:31.554 --> 14:37.703
And did any of the three have any particular higher prestige?

14:40.332 --> 14:45.758
I don't know that any had higher prestige.

14:46.539 --> 15:08.145
Now, two were state schools and one was private, and Baylor had the smallest enrollment, and probably for that reason it was thought of well for the University of Texas in Galveston, of course, was the oldest school and had a lot of tradition behind it.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.468
and did take in a larger class.

15:11.610 --> 15:16.456
And we're talking about 100, when I entered, they took in 164.

15:18.179 --> 15:24.868
And apparently the year before it was 132, and the legislature required them to go up to 64.

15:25.689 --> 15:31.536
The faculty didn't like it, and they conditioned or failed 25 students.

15:32.137 --> 15:32.698
Oh, my.

15:32.678 --> 15:41.511
And luckily I was not one of them, but a lot of those kids had to go back to pre-med another year or repeat the year and take summer school.

15:42.453 --> 15:50.885
But the point is that Baylor probably had maybe 100 students at that time or 90 or something, and I imagine Southwestern was sort of in between.

15:51.827 --> 15:55.412
When I was an undergraduate, we didn't calculate our grade point ratio.

15:56.168 --> 15:58.151
the meticulous way they do now.

15:58.292 --> 16:02.158
Did you and your friends talk about a 3.2 and a 3?

16:02.219 --> 16:05.044
Yeah, we were very conscious of our grade point ratios.

16:05.084 --> 16:08.449
Now, it was based on a 3 schedule rather than a 4.

16:08.630 --> 16:09.351
Oh, that's right.

16:09.371 --> 16:09.852
That's right.

16:10.012 --> 16:15.582
So, for example, to be a distinguished student, you had to have 2.25, which would be 3.25 now.

16:15.602 --> 16:19.088
About what did it take, you assumed,

16:19.068 --> 16:20.472
to get into medical school?

16:20.893 --> 16:27.631
I think it took at least two hours then, three hours then.

16:27.931 --> 16:34.208
And I don't think people did not make as uniformly higher grades

16:34.188 --> 17:03.756
as they do now, and I don't know if the kids are better prepared out of high school or if the grading system is a little different, but really, you know, if you took Dr. Potter's course, if you got a B minus, that was a triumph, meaning a lot of guys got C's who did get to med school maybe, but by the skin of their teeth.

17:04.816 --> 17:08.721
I think people failed more than they do now.

17:08.781 --> 17:25.504
I mean, and the faculty didn't, you know, I've talked to people in med school now, and, you know, they think of all the legal problems of failing somebody, and gosh, people just fail things in those years or made C's or D's, you know, in some cases.

17:26.205 --> 17:28.087
All right, I've got only three or four more questions.

17:28.428 --> 17:31.752
So when I say, I would say probably

17:31.732 --> 17:39.563
If you had a 3.3 average of the present scale, you could get in medical school pretty assuredly.

17:40.445 --> 17:45.091
If you had below that, you might get in and you might not.

17:46.654 --> 17:54.325
And often the med schools would have one position to open at the last minute because somebody went to another school.

17:54.745 --> 17:59.292
And if you were there at the front door and had a 2.1

17:59.272 --> 18:10.833
I've got only three or four more questions for you about your own career, but let's go back and talk about your dad after he comes back.

18:10.853 --> 18:12.817
He comes back as track coach.

18:13.178 --> 18:15.402
Well, he came back in the physical education department.

18:15.422 --> 18:16.063
Oh, okay.

18:16.083 --> 18:16.544
Yeah.

18:16.564 --> 18:18.087
And then becomes head track coach.

18:18.327 --> 18:20.030
And then Homer Norton asked him.

18:20.331 --> 18:22.495
Dad had been back maybe a year or something.

18:22.475 --> 18:29.643
And Horton came over and said, you've been a coach, and wouldn't you rather go back to coaching?

18:31.685 --> 18:35.369
And that I'd like for you to be a tri-coach.

18:35.429 --> 18:38.052
And so that dad did go back to coaching then.

18:38.933 --> 18:45.801
Do you have any idea what the salary was he started coaching?

18:45.821 --> 18:47.182
Oh, it would be minimal compared to now.

18:47.422 --> 18:51.587
I know it would be.

18:52.276 --> 18:57.969
his salary was ever over, and this is toward when he retired, about $7,500.

18:58.410 --> 19:06.129
And I'm sure that when he went back to the job, it probably was like $4,500 or something like that.

19:06.149 --> 19:10.960
I've heard through gossip that Tom Harrington never made $25,000.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.515
I don't doubt it, yeah.

19:15.036 --> 19:19.582
I think Dr. Walton's salary got up to about $10,000 or something like that.

19:20.343 --> 19:23.688
When he becomes track coach then in what year?

19:24.148 --> 19:24.970
Forty?

19:24.990 --> 19:25.971
Forty-six.

19:25.991 --> 19:26.432
Forty-six.

19:26.892 --> 19:30.197
What do you think were his greatest

19:31.527 --> 19:34.854
proudest accomplishments as a track coach?

19:35.956 --> 19:52.911
Well, I think Dad, from his viewpoint, felt that he helped to bring along a lot of athletes who were not fully developed or highly developed in high school into

19:52.891 --> 19:55.018
college level performers.

19:56.262 --> 20:02.884
And I know in maybe the first four or five years that he coached that he had

20:04.518 --> 20:15.872
as many boys on his team who were Southwest Conference champions who had not been state interscholastic champions as the rest of the teams were together.

20:15.892 --> 20:31.572
And I think that was a reflection of really having the ability to see ability before it was actual, in a potential, in other words, ability.

20:31.552 --> 20:42.368
At the other end of the scale, he had the first Southwest Conference athlete to win an Olympic gold medal in a relay event on his team.

20:43.409 --> 20:53.444
Arthur Herndon was a member of the 1600 meter relay team at the London Olympics in 1948.

20:54.425 --> 20:59.112
And then four years later, he had the first Southwest Conference athlete to win an individual gold medal.

20:59.092 --> 20:59.753
Buddy Davis.

20:59.773 --> 21:01.597
And I think that was... Was that Buddy Davis?

21:01.998 --> 21:02.960
Buddy Davis, yeah.

21:02.980 --> 21:03.702
From Niederland.

21:04.383 --> 21:04.523
Uh-huh.

21:04.543 --> 21:09.113
And Buddy, of course, was not a developed high jumper when he came here.

21:09.754 --> 21:15.005
I think he'd been to the regional meet or something and scissored six feet or six foot one or something.

21:15.045 --> 21:19.615
And, of course, he was six feet eight inches tall.

21:19.595 --> 21:24.984
And his biggest problem was he got all of his appendages together so that something didn't hit the bar.

21:25.905 --> 21:27.207
Because he could get the height.

21:28.089 --> 21:33.257
What were your, what do you think, did your dad have a favorite event?

21:33.277 --> 21:35.981
A favorite race or jump?

21:36.001 --> 21:45.957
Well, if you were talking about the running events, I think his favorite events, his favorite event would have been the low hurdles.

21:47.303 --> 22:03.549
And what he did there was often to convert a sprinter who was very good, but not quite a champion, convert him into a hurdler.

22:04.931 --> 22:08.296
And he had a great deal of success in the hurdles for that reason.

22:08.316 --> 22:15.167
Because over the years, A&M had very good 40 quarter-milers.

22:15.653 --> 22:19.167
And I must say that Ray Putnam,

22:19.653 --> 22:29.948
an economics professor and a former NCAA mile champion, did a lot of the coaching of the circle events, including the 440.

22:30.389 --> 22:35.016
And so in that second period, he had a great deal to do with the success of the boys.

22:35.036 --> 22:43.148
But A&M had wonderful mile relay teams and a series of Southwest Conference 440 champions.

22:43.168 --> 22:48.816
And my dad had, I know, one series of three-quarter mile champions

22:48.796 --> 22:59.435
one after the other, and one of whom set the record and ran the quarter mile under 50 seconds for the first time in the 1920s.

23:00.617 --> 23:01.198
He ran a 49-1.

23:02.420 --> 23:07.108
Did he have an event that was at the other end of the scale that was his least favorite?

23:07.325 --> 23:08.850
Well let me talk about the field.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.896
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:14.568 --> 23:20.828
He had a great deal of success with the shot put.

23:22.107 --> 23:24.551
And secondarily, the discus.

23:24.571 --> 23:29.740
And also Javelin, mainly in the first years of his coaching in Javelin.

23:32.164 --> 23:37.994
But in some particular, A&M had NCAA-quality boys.

23:38.775 --> 23:47.490
And of course, Darrell Hooper won the shot put one of his years, second in the Olympics.

23:47.470 --> 24:10.693
In fact, in the 1952 Olympics, Dara and Buddy Davis together, if you had scored up scores for colleges, were I think second to USC and tied with Oxford or something internationally in the Olympics.

24:11.737 --> 24:17.629
I think Oxford had a very fine miler at that time and one or two distance men.

24:18.371 --> 24:28.492
Going back to the least favorite events, I don't know if they were necessarily least favorite.

24:29.133 --> 24:30.977
Or most frustrating to them.

24:32.341 --> 24:41.196
In fact, he actually solely coached cross-country for many years.

24:42.538 --> 24:49.150
Dad was a sprinter, long jumper, broad jumper, in other words, and pole vaulter as an athlete.

24:49.370 --> 24:52.135
And so he had some interest in those areas.

24:52.295 --> 24:58.045
I think, frankly, though, he lost interest in the sprints

24:58.784 --> 25:15.523
at least 100 in particular, because I think he felt that as time went on, he had a record holder in the sprints, the first guy to run it under 10 seconds, the conference meeting, for example, in the 1920s, and had some good, good spreaders.

25:15.543 --> 25:22.651
But he did not actively recruit spreaders probably in the last seven years that he was coaching, maybe the last 10.

25:24.713 --> 25:27.897
And because he really felt that

25:29.362 --> 25:33.407
That was an event where you could do it or you couldn't do it.

25:33.428 --> 25:36.552
It didn't require a lot of coaching.

25:38.835 --> 25:44.583
We were not the most attractive recruiting school in the world at that time.

25:44.843 --> 25:56.719
He felt really he could not compete with some other school on recruiting the sprinters, so he more or less just left that to other teams.

25:56.699 --> 25:59.643
Even the second time he coached one golfers champion.

26:03.868 --> 26:13.039
The young man was lucky to win the championship because it was an off year, so to speak.

26:13.420 --> 26:17.745
But he did not push the sprints a lot, I guess.

26:18.856 --> 26:23.923
And probably in his early years, he was learning a lot about distance running, since he was not a distance runner.

26:24.804 --> 26:29.010
And that's something he had to learn over a period of time.

26:29.951 --> 26:36.961
But I don't think he really had any super negative feelings toward any of it.

26:37.582 --> 26:39.925
Right now, I'm not going to ask the negative on this one.

26:39.945 --> 26:44.712
Which coaches at other schools did he most respect?

26:46.582 --> 27:12.133
Well, I think he respected, well, of course, the two people he competed with for the most years were Clyde Littlefield, who had a remarkable record at Texas, and Emmett Brunson, who had a more meteoric record at Rice.

27:13.430 --> 27:17.316
I think he liked both of them.

27:19.179 --> 27:26.870
And he very much wanted to beat Texas.

27:27.291 --> 27:39.690
I mean, that was, and I'm sure Texas very much wanted to beat us because we were Texas as a total athletic, intercollegiate athletic.

27:39.670 --> 27:48.207
was the outstanding, dominated sports to a great extent.

27:48.607 --> 28:00.210
And NM could be competitive with Texas in track and in baseball

28:01.270 --> 28:11.592
and except for in the first 50 years of dad's coaching in football too, but not the second.

28:11.732 --> 28:15.820
I think A&M had the best record against Texas.

28:15.841 --> 28:18.486
A&M track had the best record against Texas track.

28:18.466 --> 28:20.911
in any other sport in the long run.

28:21.752 --> 28:25.500
But they were fierce competitors.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.504
I mean, but they liked each other.

28:28.385 --> 28:37.784
And Emmett Rudson at Rice, who had been a Southwest Conference mile record holder, was an extremely competitive person.

28:37.804 --> 28:40.930
And they used to call him the angry Irishman.

28:42.125 --> 28:44.510
But Dad got along well with him, too.

28:47.537 --> 28:58.682
But obviously, the University of Texas in the long run, you had to respect them and what they did, because they were consistently good.

28:59.523 --> 29:14.825
If I could chat with your dad right now, do you think I could get from him a response about which of his track performers made him the most proud?

29:16.828 --> 29:22.797
Were there some that came, you know, from nowhere to somewhere?

29:24.751 --> 29:29.238
Mickey Herskowitz, who was a Cub reporter, came up and interviewed Dad when he retired.

29:29.258 --> 29:32.604
Dad said, he was asked a question of something of that nature.

29:32.644 --> 29:43.020
He said, somewhere between Walter Davis on the winter stand of the Olympics and Jerry Bunnen on his knees at the finish of the two-mile.

29:44.202 --> 29:48.970
Jerry Bunnen was a fellow who went to Consolidated.

29:50.452 --> 30:06.237
was a two-mounter in college, and Jerry had a lot of intestinal fortitude and enough ability to place in meets, but was not a champion.

30:07.399 --> 30:10.283
And in the 1947 conference meet,

30:11.967 --> 30:16.133
The meat was going down to the last event, as to who was going to win.

30:16.153 --> 30:22.041
And the two mile was one of the, something like the next to last, or two or three for the last.

30:22.061 --> 30:22.983
Very close to the end.

30:23.243 --> 30:26.728
And every point was, you know, important.

30:26.748 --> 30:35.140
And Jerry came off the final turn and hit the curb and fell.

30:35.120 --> 30:39.425
And really just sure guts brought him in.

30:40.046 --> 30:46.553
There's a photo of him in one of the annuals, and it shows him about four yards from the finish line.

30:46.573 --> 30:53.421
And he looked like a kyphotic guy who was about four feet tall.

30:53.461 --> 30:55.043
He could not even stand up.

30:55.063 --> 30:57.886
I mean, he was crunchy.

30:57.906 --> 30:59.027
But he got across the line.

30:59.047 --> 30:59.888
Oh, that's good.

30:59.908 --> 31:00.469
That's good.

31:00.702 --> 31:03.526
All right, let's go back then to you.

31:04.428 --> 31:09.215
You knew what you were going to do the year after commencement, so it wasn't to get a job.

31:09.255 --> 31:10.697
You were going to medical school.

31:12.280 --> 31:16.286
How well prepared did you think you were for medical school?

31:17.848 --> 31:22.896
Well, I didn't know.
