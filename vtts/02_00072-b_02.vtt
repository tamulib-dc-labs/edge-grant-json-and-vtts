00:02.714 --> 00:11.012
Once that I had thrown out of school, or he had flunked out, and he was readmitted a year later.

00:12.696 --> 00:18.247
And he came to me and said that was the best thing that had ever happened to him.

00:18.268 --> 00:22.697
I mean, he thanked me because he had shaped up.

00:23.318 --> 00:25.561
And that was why he shaped up.

00:26.242 --> 00:28.505
Now, I don't recall.

00:28.525 --> 00:32.790
We did a couple other things that we tried to do.

00:32.810 --> 00:37.977
I tried to start a summer.

00:37.997 --> 00:45.867
I was interested in trying to bring more minorities into the college.

00:45.847 --> 00:53.698
And I ran a program one summer, I called it, what was it?

00:53.718 --> 00:55.881
Learn, work and learn or something.

00:56.963 --> 00:57.684
Earn and learn.

00:59.686 --> 01:13.626
And these, the participants in this program were to come to campus for a period of something like six or eight weeks and work with a professor.

01:14.534 --> 01:15.475
in the college.

01:17.697 --> 01:19.819
And they were all, they were black.

01:20.159 --> 01:22.021
All of them were black.

01:22.041 --> 01:26.084
And the funding came.

01:26.144 --> 01:28.286
We paid them $2,000 a month.

01:28.446 --> 01:31.449
Now, these are undergraduates?

01:31.469 --> 01:36.033
These are, well, these were undergraduates at other schools.

01:36.053 --> 01:41.798
I recruited, I've forgotten where they were coming from.

01:41.838 --> 01:43.900
They were all, we were trying to recruit them

01:45.668 --> 01:51.574
They must have been out of high school, because we were trying to get them to think about graduate programs.

01:51.594 --> 01:54.377
They were juniors in college.

01:55.318 --> 01:58.461
We had funds for five of them.

01:58.742 --> 02:01.024
The funding came from petroleum companies.

02:03.086 --> 02:13.397
And so I had these five very bright, two women, I think, three men around.

02:14.609 --> 02:18.522
We assigned them to work with professors.

02:18.643 --> 02:24.502
Now, the problem with that is that you have to have a dedicated professor that's willing to spend the time.

02:24.803 --> 02:26.188
That's what I found.

02:27.181 --> 02:37.918
And I saw that they got a trip to NASA, and I took them to visit a petroleum company in Houston, and we had a whole program for them.

02:39.260 --> 02:49.376
And I hoped that out of this, maybe one or two might even consider doing graduate studies.

02:50.818 --> 02:51.619
None of them did.

02:53.185 --> 03:03.499
But one young man, I've forgotten where I met him, somewhere on campus, he had come to an event on campus, he went to Rice and Engineering, you see.

03:04.340 --> 03:10.829
And he had remembered me with pleasure, and he came up and told me what he was doing.

03:12.070 --> 03:21.403
But I didn't follow up, you know, that program might have, this was when it was very hard before we had any blacks on campus.

03:21.788 --> 03:25.614
And this was the start of an attempt to get them into geosciences.

03:26.295 --> 03:35.188
It's very difficult in geosciences to attract minority students that have the math physics background.

03:36.250 --> 03:51.272
That's what we found with, maybe it's changing now, but certainly when you went through the list of SAT scores and ACT scores, there were a few

03:52.349 --> 04:08.147
Blacks and Hispanics that really would have had the ability to handle the math physics unless they had come and spent a year in remediation.

04:09.815 --> 04:12.439
And you can't invite them to do that.

04:12.459 --> 04:29.147
And I'm assuming also that you would, if we could have checked on their high school backgrounds, that there were not many youngsters from small town high schools that would have had limited math and science offerings.

04:29.167 --> 04:29.548
Amen.

04:30.730 --> 04:31.150
Let's see.

04:31.551 --> 04:35.738
See if you agree with this theory that I've heard others share.

04:36.477 --> 04:58.549
that one of the reasons why it is difficult to recruit American nationals into the graduate programs in science and technology is that the outstanding undergraduate degree recipients get captured quickly with real fine salaries by American corporations.

04:59.731 --> 05:03.717
And so rather than go get a PhD, they get a big salary for a corporation.

05:04.270 --> 05:18.550
and we scholars then award our assistantships and fellowships quite often to international students who are not as likely to get that job right out of undergraduate school.

05:18.650 --> 05:18.951
Is that?

05:19.291 --> 05:20.933
I suspect there's some truth to that.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.477
I certainly know that in geophysics,

05:24.773 --> 05:46.377
When most of our undergraduates were, I mean, it was like buying a football team with scholarship money, that those kids, so many of them, rarely did they ever go on to graduate school, not because the industry was snapping them up.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.981
And that was true in geophysics.

05:49.902 --> 05:59.754
And in Texas, of course, the petroleum companies, the employment goes with the industry, up and down.

06:00.374 --> 06:04.399
But when geophysicists are needed, they're paid very well.

06:05.380 --> 06:13.410
Now, did the job market for the students in geophysics and specifically, but in geosciences in general,

06:13.812 --> 06:20.579
Did the job market tend to go along with oil prices up and down?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.141
Oh, yeah.

06:22.161 --> 06:41.541
Now, the other thing that was interesting in the college is the reluctance of many of our science faculty to consider geography as really belonging in the college.

06:42.331 --> 06:44.573
And, you know, I had a different view.

06:44.713 --> 06:49.417
I had a view that they were a leavening influence on the college.

06:49.878 --> 06:51.799
And in their own right, they're scholars.

06:53.281 --> 07:02.669
But there certainly were some faculty that were unhappy when resources, when they saw enrollment in geography was booming.

07:03.970 --> 07:11.236
And the undergraduate coursework available in geography was extensive.

07:11.336 --> 07:12.237
And in fact,

07:13.212 --> 07:35.355
Perhaps the only reason that we could justify ourselves in terms of student credit hours was, geography was a live department, and geology, the first, the undergraduate geology two semesters brought in a lot of student credit hours.

07:35.808 --> 07:44.900
Now, I happen to be of the view, unfortunately, a state university seldom has that flexibility.

07:45.781 --> 07:55.875
But I believe that there are many disciplines that enrich a campus that are never going to have large numbers of students.

07:56.294 --> 08:00.179
And in fact, when I was at Brown, they started the Department of Egyptology.

08:02.081 --> 08:18.260
The major professor was a mathematician, Nugabar, whose interest was in kideiform mathematics, if you will, and so forth.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.964
Well, I think these things enrich a university.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.820
but there's no room for them in an A&M.

08:25.541 --> 08:26.342
I think that's sad.

08:26.783 --> 08:28.465
Yes, yes.

08:28.485 --> 08:34.834
And geophysics has always been borderline in terms of enrollment.

08:34.854 --> 08:39.059
When we had scholarship funds, we could make the enrollment.

08:40.161 --> 08:44.407
I think that's one reason that they reunited the two departments.

08:45.528 --> 08:48.492
When you, during your dean years,

08:50.125 --> 08:55.258
What were the other tough courses that a typical geosciences major dreaded

08:55.357 --> 08:56.419
other than math?

08:56.579 --> 08:57.200
What were they?

08:57.740 --> 09:07.594
Well, they all took the chemistry 101, 102, and physics 218, 219.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.457
I mean, those were required.

09:09.697 --> 09:11.540
And those were the tough ones.

09:12.021 --> 09:14.584
Those are the freshman basic courses.

09:14.685 --> 09:20.433
And in math, they were required to take up through differential equations.

09:20.493 --> 09:24.098
That was true of geology, geophysics, meteorology.

09:24.078 --> 09:29.071
Now, oceanography didn't have an undergraduate curriculum.

09:29.933 --> 09:39.117
During those years, again, not going to ask the negative, who are the teachers, using that word deliberately, who are the teachers

09:39.518 --> 09:50.477
both within the College of Geosciences and outside, that you feel they earned their reputation for doing their instruction well?

09:51.018 --> 09:53.342
Who are the teachers that deserve a pat on the back?

09:53.622 --> 10:00.574
When I first got to A&M, Trav Parker was certainly an excellent teacher.

10:00.795 --> 10:01.516
In geology?

10:01.977 --> 10:04.581
In geology.

10:07.362 --> 10:10.307
Boy, that's a tough one to start picking.

10:10.808 --> 10:25.892
In my department, I think in many ways, Tony Ganji probably was the best teacher, but you had to be able to stand up.

10:26.754 --> 10:27.615
He could be

10:28.135 --> 10:31.660
at times, his own quite demanding.

10:33.183 --> 10:37.529
But he certainly gave the students a great deal.

10:46.062 --> 10:54.155
Bill, the former dean of faculties before Janice Stout.

10:54.816 --> 10:56.218
Oh, oh, oh.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.224
In math.

10:58.665 --> 10:59.526
In math, yeah.

10:59.566 --> 11:00.006
You bet.

11:00.126 --> 11:00.567
You bet.

11:00.587 --> 11:03.830
You're asking me who had a good reputation.

11:03.870 --> 11:04.711
Right.

11:05.251 --> 11:05.932
I've forgotten what it is.

11:06.392 --> 11:08.034
Here, I can't recall it either right now.

11:08.214 --> 11:08.695
Bill Perry.

11:08.955 --> 11:09.756
Bill Perry.

11:09.856 --> 11:10.116
Yes.

11:10.156 --> 11:10.416
Sure.

11:11.918 --> 11:12.759
Splendid teacher.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.883
I mean, that comes to mind immediately.

11:17.904 --> 11:24.130
In geography, I mean...

11:24.802 --> 11:34.575
Every teacher in that department had some particular virtue of one sort or another, but it was an interesting collection of people.

11:35.382 --> 11:39.126
Chemistry, physics, biology?

11:39.146 --> 11:44.913
I can't single anyone out.

11:45.594 --> 11:51.341
Probably if I went down a list of faculty names, I could pick out somebody from chemistry.

11:51.361 --> 11:57.508
Who were the great researchers that we haven't mentioned yet in geosciences?

11:58.518 --> 11:58.979
Okay.

11:58.999 --> 12:02.145
Well, we've mentioned the Handen Group.

12:02.165 --> 12:03.087
I certainly feel that.

12:03.828 --> 12:04.510
Bob Reed.

12:09.279 --> 12:10.842
Syed L. Syed.

12:11.443 --> 12:18.417
Not so much as a researcher as a global science researcher.

12:20.472 --> 12:29.331
a person able to integrate globally in several people in oceanography.

12:29.351 --> 12:35.123
I think when I first came here, Bill Sackett,

12:35.744 --> 12:37.428
was one of those people.

12:39.593 --> 12:51.120
Worth Nowlin, certainly, and now the head of the meteorology department.

12:56.905 --> 13:00.488
Gordon Eaton, but he wasn't able to do research here.

13:05.853 --> 13:19.506
In my home department of geophysics, Terry Spencer's had a productive time, but I wouldn't say that he shook down any great walls.

13:22.128 --> 13:26.592
Neville Carter, certainly I would have put among the first rate.

13:27.112 --> 13:38.039
And when I say this, these people are not always successful in getting funding, and yet in their fields, they're understood to be outstanding.

13:38.540 --> 13:39.162
Bob Berg.

13:39.523 --> 13:40.365
Forget about Bob.

13:40.385 --> 13:42.049
I shouldn't forget about Bob Berg.

13:43.396 --> 13:51.588
He's a National Society of Engineers.

13:51.608 --> 14:05.548
Were there any big grants, big research accomplishments that really were, look back, that were really steps up?

14:06.650 --> 14:07.952
The ocean drilling project.

14:08.292 --> 14:08.432
Okay.

14:08.453 --> 14:10.415
Bringing the ocean drilling project.

14:10.495 --> 14:12.238
Who deserves credit for that?

14:12.860 --> 14:13.921
for getting it here?

14:14.342 --> 14:19.567
I think Phil Rabinowitz, he was, he had come to A&M in the oceanography department.

14:19.988 --> 14:21.109
Certainly, he was one.

14:25.814 --> 14:35.425
I'm sure that some of the administrators probably, I don't know when they came here when Gordon Eaton was dean or whether it was before that.

14:37.193 --> 14:42.926
But Bob Reed, the people on oceanography were the people that drove that.

14:43.307 --> 14:47.658
Describe in general, what did the ocean drilling program include?

14:49.261 --> 14:49.983
What did it do?

14:50.003 --> 14:50.865
Okay.

14:53.275 --> 15:00.322
You have to know what the ocean drilling program was doing before it came to A&M.

15:01.844 --> 15:06.188
The program was set up to drill the ocean basin.

15:06.288 --> 15:12.094
Number one, to look for evidence of the sea floor spreading hypothesis or paradigm.

15:13.135 --> 15:20.903
It had been managed by Scripps in La Jolla, and it had a worldwide

15:21.710 --> 15:27.417
One of the things is that it brings participation in through the global community.

15:27.898 --> 15:33.184
And it had this reputation, except Scripps didn't do a very good job of servicing it.

15:34.266 --> 15:49.725
And all I can remember now is I was involved in one or two of the early talks, but then I think a committee was set up, Steve, well,

15:51.173 --> 15:57.903
He's a paleontologist in oceanography.

15:57.963 --> 16:04.954
Steve Gartner was involved, and I know Phil, I'm sure, Worthen Allen, and Bill Merrill.

16:05.034 --> 16:06.436
Bill Merrill, probably.

16:06.877 --> 16:11.223
Bill Merrill was probably one of the biggies.

16:11.624 --> 16:12.906
In helping bring it?

16:13.066 --> 16:13.907
In helping bring it.

16:14.309 --> 16:19.678
Bill was very savvy, as you're probably aware, also very ambitious, I think.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.763
Did we have some other major competitors?

16:23.845 --> 16:40.873
Well, the meeting to establish the renewal for the next five years, Scripps was certainly hoped to repeat and expected to repeat.

16:41.562 --> 16:45.345
Now, I don't know who else, whether anybody else made a proposal

16:46.034 --> 16:54.865
But I think the committee, I think they were shook up when A&M came forth with a very substantial proposal.

16:55.346 --> 17:04.057
But of course, one of the things is the board promised to build the core facilities or something.

17:04.858 --> 17:09.744
A&M guaranteed the equivalent of three or four million dollars.

17:09.924 --> 17:10.785
Our Board of Regents.

17:11.045 --> 17:12.447
Our Board of Regents.

17:12.427 --> 17:23.767
And that's something that you would have to talk with somebody else about to see how it actually came about.

17:25.109 --> 17:34.165
But that was the first time, to my knowledge, that A&M had acquired a national

17:34.482 --> 17:36.224
project of major size.

17:37.044 --> 17:41.068
And that brought in something like $40 million a year.

17:41.989 --> 17:43.250
And it has been renewed.

17:44.351 --> 17:51.078
And it clearly put us in the major league with Scripps, Lamont, and so forth.

17:51.638 --> 17:57.444
Now, whether we've taken advantage of that, I don't think we have.

17:58.765 --> 18:02.228
Now, one thing it has done, it brought a continual

18:02.680 --> 18:12.537
stream of Earth scientists from all over the world to A&M.

18:12.557 --> 18:20.411
You can perhaps remember how hard it might have been in 1963 to bring a scholar to A&M to talk.

18:20.511 --> 18:22.594
I mean, they go through Houston and Dallas.

18:23.696 --> 18:25.920
No way you could get them to come to

18:27.605 --> 18:56.565
I can remember the first couple of years, the American Geophysical Union, I think, or was it GSA, had a program where they brought international scholars to this country for tours.

18:58.182 --> 19:04.640
And I was instrumental in applying for one of these grants in person.

19:04.680 --> 19:10.335
The individual that came was the survey director in Israel.

19:11.328 --> 19:16.675
And I had met him at a meeting in Monaco.

19:16.836 --> 19:20.380
And he was tremendous.

19:20.421 --> 19:21.582
He gave three lectures.

19:22.403 --> 19:27.951
But those first few years, I was the only one trying to do something like this.

19:29.773 --> 19:31.976
And it was like fighting uphill.

19:32.898 --> 19:37.504
Now, when Ocean Drilling first got here, the facility was the

19:37.872 --> 19:39.556
The new quarters are already ready for them.

19:40.237 --> 19:42.643
Where were they housed when they first arrived?

19:44.367 --> 19:48.958
Well, I don't remember.

19:49.880 --> 19:56.455
I don't remember where the office, it must have been in oceanography that they had an office.

19:57.059 --> 20:07.779
Before we took over, certainly we had to have the core facilities built in the major building, and maybe that building was already under construction out at the research park.

20:07.799 --> 20:09.221
Because that's where they're housed now.

20:09.281 --> 20:10.063
Yes, right.

20:10.363 --> 20:15.152
So it may well be that that building already existed.

20:15.132 --> 20:32.702
Now, if someone nationally were looking at us in geosciences today and trying to rank us, compare us, at what level would they put us?

20:32.682 --> 20:36.728
Well, probably the second ten.

20:37.610 --> 20:47.185
I mean, I don't think we quite made, you know, we always, in geophysics, we always hoped that we would make it to the Wisconsin level.

20:47.906 --> 20:50.370
We thought Wisconsin was,

20:50.350 --> 20:53.675
I don't think we ever did quite got there.

20:54.456 --> 20:56.198
And I think we've backslid since then.

20:56.559 --> 21:04.130
Who else in the Southwest would be comparable to us or vice versa?

21:04.150 --> 21:10.519
UT has a good, strong earth science program.

21:10.619 --> 21:18.450
And of course, they also have the state survey and the library is there.

21:18.430 --> 21:24.398
So they are a strong competitor, and they have a research group at Balcones.

21:25.299 --> 21:32.048
Art Maxwell was the director for many years that were doing marine geophysical things.

21:32.068 --> 21:40.960
In fact, I did some work with Joel Watkins now in our department, was part of the group in Galveston.

21:40.980 --> 21:47.408
If you recall, maybe UT set up a laboratory in Galveston.

21:47.388 --> 21:51.414
Maurice Ewing, when he had to retire from Le Mans, wouldn't retire.

21:51.674 --> 21:58.084
He came to UT and started that marine group, and they had a facility in Galveston.

21:58.104 --> 22:01.509
They were doing multi-channel seismic work in the Gulf.

22:01.529 --> 22:08.299
And that was the start of a fairly strong, stronger program than we had in that kind of geophysics.

22:09.120 --> 22:14.408
Now, if we went, say, five, six hundred mile radius,

22:15.451 --> 22:21.358
Going east, there's no one until we get, does Georgia Tech have anything of our quality?

22:21.558 --> 22:21.818
No.

22:22.319 --> 22:22.599
No.

22:22.799 --> 22:26.644
We'd go all the way to the mid-Atlantic coast?

22:27.084 --> 22:28.526
Let's see, where would we go?

22:30.147 --> 22:42.201
You know, there are a little bright spikes here and there, but for example, Oklahoma has a fairly strong, it's a geology group, I would think.

22:42.181 --> 22:56.381
But in terms of oceanography, the schools we would be competing with at the moment would be the University of Rhode Island, Delaware.

22:58.063 --> 23:06.214
We're not able to compete with Woods Hole or Scripps as much as we might like to.

23:07.730 --> 23:09.112
I mean, you sort of have to think.

23:09.232 --> 23:17.341
There are not too many schools that combine all those disciplines in, say, one college.

23:20.985 --> 23:21.486
Let's see.

23:23.909 --> 23:25.170
We talked about best teachers.

23:26.111 --> 23:27.673
Oh, humor.

23:28.774 --> 23:33.940
When you and I arrived, there were some old-time faculty members that had nicknames.

23:34.595 --> 23:40.383
Do you remember any of the nicknames in geology or any of the other disciplines over your way?

23:41.064 --> 23:41.925
No.

23:42.005 --> 23:46.311
I don't think there were any nicknames in my department.

23:47.312 --> 23:48.374
Not that I remember.

23:48.774 --> 23:55.123
I've not heard of any, but I thought there might have been some in geography.

23:57.306 --> 23:59.168
Let's see.

23:59.148 --> 24:04.850
When I came, the only geographers were Ed Duran and Schleselman?

24:04.870 --> 24:05.733
No, geology.

24:06.014 --> 24:06.777
Oh, geology.

24:07.199 --> 24:08.584
Oh, Schleselman was Skipper.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.094
Oh, okay.

24:10.794 --> 24:11.195
All right.

24:11.215 --> 24:13.317
I don't know why, but he was Skipper Schleselman.

24:13.477 --> 24:14.398
Oh, okay.

24:14.418 --> 24:15.959
Well, I didn't know that.

24:16.239 --> 24:22.745
And in geology, there was, you know, we've already mentioned Fred Smith and Carl Koenig.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.729
I don't know whether they had any nicknames or not.

24:26.789 --> 24:28.330
No, I don't know.

24:28.350 --> 24:39.280
What about, do you remember any incidents either in your classroom, laboratory, or that you heard about of Aggie student pranks

24:39.260 --> 24:44.888
Any good bull, any stunts, any jokes?

24:50.055 --> 24:54.060
I'm sure there have been, but it doesn't come to mind.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.343
Nobody ever tried this?

24:56.423 --> 24:58.286
No, I can think of a non-joke.

24:58.386 --> 25:08.980
I can remember walking into my office in Hal Booty the first or second year I was there and looking at my desk and it was all different colors of green and blue and whatever.

25:09.517 --> 25:16.206
And directly overhead, third floor Halbooty, Chem Engineering still was in the building and they had a wet lab.

25:16.346 --> 25:18.248
And it was dripping through the ceiling.

25:18.389 --> 25:19.610
And something had come through?

25:19.790 --> 25:20.111
Yes.

25:20.812 --> 25:21.252
Yeah, right.

25:21.573 --> 25:22.935
It wasn't an intended joke.

25:23.295 --> 25:23.615
I know.

25:23.856 --> 25:24.897
Oh, I know one.

25:25.017 --> 25:36.432
Who were the key staff members, talking about office now, at the departmental or college level that deserve special note?

25:36.833 --> 25:38.475
Oh, boy.

25:38.495 --> 25:38.595
Okay.

25:38.575 --> 25:47.992
Who were the folks that made... I'm trying to remember the secretary in geology, Mrs. Oh.

25:48.012 --> 25:49.074
She deserved specials.

25:51.698 --> 25:53.141
I can't remember now.

25:54.624 --> 25:55.946
What about at the college level?

25:58.851 --> 25:59.072
Oh, boy.

26:01.235 --> 26:01.596
Well...

26:07.617 --> 26:10.220
I'd have to think a lot.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.183
I mean, there's nobody that immediately pops out.

26:13.703 --> 26:20.670
Because in the college, we've had a lot of staff people, not just secretarial staff.

26:21.251 --> 26:27.136
The Oceanography Department had a machine shop maintenance group of people.

26:28.358 --> 26:35.785
And tectonophysics, Jack McGurk came with the Shell Group, and certainly

26:35.765 --> 26:38.709
made their operation possible.

26:41.112 --> 26:51.868
Gladys Byers, not related to Dean Byers, but Gladys Byers was secretary in geology when I came.

26:53.229 --> 26:58.156
She then moved to another office on campus, but she was outstanding.

26:59.899 --> 27:04.405
That's what I'm trying to remember.

27:06.173 --> 27:08.876
Let's see.

27:08.896 --> 27:12.940
Are there some topics that we have not yet gotten to we should have?

27:19.086 --> 27:19.987
I'm trying to think.

27:20.748 --> 27:33.541
As you look back in your own career, what were some of the proudest moments for you as a faculty and administrator, faculty member administrator at A&M?

27:33.601 --> 27:34.442
What were some of the

27:37.443 --> 27:42.428
Well, I guess I'm happy I survived.

27:44.410 --> 27:56.822
At a personal level, you may be aware that my wife passed away after childbirth, and so I had five kids to raise, and I had to curtail my going to sea.

27:58.904 --> 28:03.889
I look back and say, I'm not sure how I manage, but all my kids are...

28:04.443 --> 28:09.892
are happily married and going in the right direction and so forth.

28:10.654 --> 28:11.936
I feel that's a plus.

28:15.221 --> 28:21.372
I think I certainly had the respect of my colleagues in the college when I was in the dean's office.

28:21.352 --> 28:31.843
I happen to think that the best administration is the one you never hear about, that there's no hassle.

28:31.963 --> 28:43.976
And probably there are a lot of students out there that recognize that, although I may never hear directly from them.

28:44.116 --> 28:48.220
Yeah, and eventually I did...

28:48.368 --> 28:51.517
Oh yeah, there's an amusing story.

28:51.537 --> 28:59.779
After I've been here a couple of years, a couple of years I went off on AGU lecture tours.

29:01.143 --> 29:17.066
I went to, one year I went to Baylor in Texas Tech, and I've forgotten where else, and I was lecturing on the current sea floor spreading or whatever.

29:18.608 --> 29:24.737
I went up to Baylor, I had a small geology department, very cordial, I had a good time.

29:26.118 --> 29:30.063
And, you know, I was proud of having the AGU lectureship.

29:30.083 --> 29:40.976
But what was so funny is that the guest quarters at Baylor at that time were in the new women's dormitory.

29:41.977 --> 29:48.424
And if you can recall in 1965, Aggies dated Baylor girls.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.429
So here I am with a room in the Baylor

29:52.747 --> 29:54.089
girls' dormitory.

29:55.211 --> 30:14.181
I gave my lecture at 7.30 at night, and then after the lecture was over, there were no bars, but I go to some professor's home, and we have a few drinks, and we have a good time, and he takes me back to the dormitories.

30:15.005 --> 30:36.540
take into account that in those days the dormitory closed at 10 o'clock or 10 30 so here i am at 11 30 at night slightly high pounding on the door to this dormitory trying to wake up the house mother who had a light i mean i could see a light back there and eventually i got back in

30:38.410 --> 30:52.862
Now, the other interesting thing from that particular chore, amongst the other thing, I had a stipend of $300, which I bought an Accutron watch.

30:53.242 --> 30:54.625
Do you remember the Accutrons?

30:54.826 --> 30:55.588
I still have it.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.073
They can't repair it.

30:58.492 --> 31:10.691
When I went to sea on oceanographic cruises, that Accutron watch was better timed than the ship's chronometer.

31:10.731 --> 31:12.754
It did not drift as much.

31:13.856 --> 31:15.578
So, I still have that.

31:15.658 --> 31:18.643
I ought to try and get it fixed sometime.

31:20.260 --> 31:27.657
And then eventually I was given one of the former students awards.

31:27.677 --> 31:31.185
For teaching, research, service?

31:31.326 --> 31:35.856
No, for student service.
