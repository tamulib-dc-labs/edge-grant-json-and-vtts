00:02.326 --> 00:04.168
Cofer.

00:05.489 --> 00:06.270
I forget what it is.

00:06.390 --> 00:07.871
Dusty Butts.

00:07.891 --> 00:08.312
D.B.

00:08.412 --> 00:09.333
Dusty Butts Cofer.

00:09.393 --> 00:10.133
Did you have one?

00:12.336 --> 00:15.458
Fish Pierce or Fish Ferocious Pierce Pierce Pierce Pierce Pierce Pierce.

00:15.499 --> 00:18.261
And Happy Hairy Hearth, I've heard.

00:18.642 --> 00:19.763
No, I hadn't heard that one.

00:21.504 --> 00:22.025
Let's see.

00:22.085 --> 00:24.267
Did Abbott have one, John Paul?

00:26.929 --> 00:27.810
Not that I know of.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.432
He was a very distinguished man.

00:29.552 --> 00:30.713
I mean, he was

00:32.617 --> 00:35.378
He was really a very presentable man.

00:35.419 --> 00:37.716
He was a gentleman and a scholar.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.962
and much admired.

00:41.022 --> 00:49.695
And when I met Robert Penn Warren, he asked after John Fall and spoke of him very favorably as one of his favorite students.

00:49.715 --> 00:52.379
Had Dr. Abbott done work at Vanderbilt?

00:52.920 --> 00:54.002
Is that where they overlapped?

00:54.022 --> 00:55.384
Yeah.

00:55.604 --> 00:58.709
I think he had a degree from Vanderbilt.

00:58.869 --> 00:59.590
He was a doctor.

01:00.071 --> 01:01.834
Dr. Abbott's specialty was what?

01:02.915 --> 01:06.120
Special field.

01:06.140 --> 01:08.884
I really, really don't remember.

01:10.687 --> 01:16.835
Now, in those, in the 40s and 50s, were there many English, Aggie English majors?

01:18.217 --> 01:18.397
No.

01:19.218 --> 01:22.022
So that they're taking English as support courses.

01:22.042 --> 01:23.844
Well, they were as a required course.

01:24.405 --> 01:34.939
I mean, they, they had so many hours of liberal arts that they had to take and

01:36.758 --> 01:45.015
So they had to take basic course and finally they got so they, I don't think they have to take any writing whatsoever now at A&M.

01:45.095 --> 01:52.311
I think it's horrendous that they assume that they have learned something that they haven't learned.

01:52.331 --> 01:57.822
How well prepared were these youngsters for their freshman English out of high school?

01:58.240 --> 02:05.209
Well, it depended entirely on what kind of school they came from and what level they were in.

02:05.449 --> 02:09.695
We were taking students from the bottom quartile of their class.

02:11.918 --> 02:18.606
Did anybody ever raise a question with you or the department about the pass rate, flunk rate?

02:21.270 --> 02:23.212
I've never heard of any argument.

02:24.614 --> 02:27.538
I remember flunking

02:28.733 --> 02:45.151
In the year that we had these midnight yell practices that went on to 4 o'clock in the morning, I remember flunking 20 out of 24 students in that freshman English class.

02:46.872 --> 02:55.922
And the four English, four students that passed were all veterans who didn't have to go to midnight yell practice until 4 o'clock in the morning.

02:58.754 --> 03:01.582
So they were the only ones that were wide awake at class.

03:01.662 --> 03:10.587
I mean, 50 minutes of sleep was about, oh, most of them were capable of it, but nobody ever said any word to me about

03:12.035 --> 03:18.705
I often had, in those early years, I had as many as 50% to 55% failure.

03:19.686 --> 03:20.387
But nobody ever?

03:20.848 --> 03:22.350
Nobody ever said anything to me.

03:22.911 --> 03:33.807
The only, in the later years, the only time that we, I was, had questions about teaching was

03:35.339 --> 03:39.726
We had a young man whose father was a very distinguished professor at another school.

03:39.766 --> 03:40.828
I forget what his name was.

03:41.769 --> 03:46.897
But he came down here, and he flunked everybody.

03:48.640 --> 03:54.069
And I was asked to review a set of his papers.

03:56.272 --> 04:02.342
And I said, well, you can't fault anything that the young man wrote.

04:04.398 --> 04:10.913
But I said, he's grading these people as if they're graduate students.

04:10.934 --> 04:15.705
He's expecting the level of a graduate student and a very bright graduate student.

04:15.925 --> 04:19.133
And I said, I would hate to have him grade any of my work.

04:20.733 --> 04:23.558
But that was the only time I ever recall.

04:24.339 --> 04:34.056
When women came in, there were some teachers in the English department and other departments who refused to give women A's.

04:36.480 --> 04:40.767
Even though they deserved them, they refused to give them A's.

04:41.489 --> 04:49.041
There was such an uprising, not only among students in some case, but some of the teachers were just horrified.

04:49.121 --> 04:59.076
And of course, the people that were most horrified were the mother's clubs, that their boys would associate with women who would corrupt them.

04:59.657 --> 05:06.788
And then a year afterwards, when we took in the blacks, nothing was said because we'd already hit rock bottom with women.

05:07.713 --> 05:08.755
which I thought was horrible.

05:08.815 --> 05:13.222
I thought that was the best step A&M ever took was to admit women.

05:15.686 --> 05:17.530
That's up in the 60s now.

05:18.030 --> 05:24.321
What do you think was the basic faculty attitude at A&M about coeducation?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.363
It was mixed.

05:27.383 --> 05:33.111
There were some of us who thought it was the best thing that ever happened and wondered why it hadn't happened before.

05:34.053 --> 05:41.284
And some of the people were just simply horrified and refused almost to teach women.

05:41.524 --> 05:44.048
But if there had been a vote, what do you think the vote would have been?

05:45.665 --> 05:48.148
I think it would have, might have been 50%.

05:48.268 --> 05:49.028
Oh really?

05:49.809 --> 05:51.291
Yeah.

05:52.192 --> 05:54.754
I think some of the teachers were afraid of women.

05:55.455 --> 06:05.605
At first, the undergraduate courses were open to women who were a dependent of a student or an employee.

06:06.106 --> 06:06.706
Yeah.

06:07.327 --> 06:12.152
Describe in your own classes those first years with women.

06:12.232 --> 06:15.115
How were they, how did it occur in class?

06:16.833 --> 06:24.061
I don't recall necessarily.

06:24.101 --> 06:33.191
There weren't that many women at that time, and I may not have had any at that time, but I had some excellent women.

06:34.373 --> 06:45.405
I also taught extension courses at times for secretaries and things like that, and most of them were very bright.

06:46.347 --> 06:47.429
What about with blacks?

06:47.469 --> 06:48.850
Do you remember any problems at all?

06:49.992 --> 06:59.545
Well, I had trouble with only one black student that I can recall, the others I got along well with.

07:00.887 --> 07:04.813
This one black student was a hotshot basketball.

07:04.833 --> 07:11.562
He had been a junior college transfer and he had been a hotshot.

07:14.444 --> 07:21.433
He thought he didn't have to do anything in my class, and I got in touch with

07:23.000 --> 07:26.605
Jerry, I forget who he was.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.749
He was Phi Beta Kappa with one of the coaches.

07:29.989 --> 07:30.750
Oh, Jerry Kleyburn.

07:30.911 --> 07:31.572
Jerry Kleyburn.

07:31.792 --> 07:33.194
He was with Mayor Bryant.

07:33.214 --> 07:33.995
Yeah.

07:34.015 --> 07:47.313
I got in touch with Jerry and told him, I said, I don't know whether you care about this student or not, but you're going to have to get him straight or he's going to flunk.

07:48.494 --> 07:50.577
And I said, I'm going to kick him out of the class.

07:51.856 --> 07:57.105
And so Jerry tried to talk to him, but never had any success.

07:57.225 --> 08:00.210
And he never made any effort.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.015
And we had a very strict gut rule in speech.

08:03.436 --> 08:05.900
And he didn't show up.

08:05.980 --> 08:10.708
And so I flunked him and told him, no point in you coming after this.

08:10.688 --> 08:14.372
What were your basic guidelines in teaching?

08:15.132 --> 08:21.339
In turn, your basic philosophy and your guidelines about attendance and makeup tests and so forth?

08:21.979 --> 08:35.413
Well, for one thing, I didn't have much faith in tests and in speech and creative writing where I was director of both.

08:36.372 --> 08:49.625
I didn't require examinations because I remember the one semester I taught in high school was students demanded an examination.

08:51.386 --> 08:55.170
And so I said, all right, I'll give you the questions in advance.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.613
I'll let you have the open textbook.

08:58.633 --> 09:03.578
And I said, I'll still bet I could flunk 90 percent of you legitimately.

09:04.992 --> 09:17.773
And so I gave them open textbook examination of questions in advance, and then I showed them how I could flunk them on the language, choice of language, grammar, punctuation, things like that.

09:17.793 --> 09:21.599
So I never required tests for those areas.

09:21.619 --> 09:24.604
And as I said,

09:25.917 --> 09:33.045
I didn't believe in tests too much with especially grading other people's examinations when their requirements were different.

09:33.545 --> 09:39.772
Frediak felt demanded everything in the first sentence identifying the whole thing.

09:40.854 --> 09:46.260
Somebody else wanted that at the end and sort of bibliography and so on.

09:46.840 --> 09:52.026
And I was sort of in the middle ground, but what I tried to do was

09:52.006 --> 10:07.507
For example, in the so-called public speaking course, I said, now, we call this public speaking, but it's very doubtful that many of you are ever going to make public speeches.

10:08.608 --> 10:15.077
But I said, you are going to talk a hundred times during a given day.

10:16.508 --> 10:19.493
And you're going to discuss many different things.

10:20.635 --> 10:23.981
And in some great many cases, you're going to be interrupted.

10:25.303 --> 10:38.145
So I said, what my philosophy is, is for you to talk about what you know in a simple, direct, straightforward manner and that you

10:40.268 --> 10:50.705
have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but if somebody interrupts you, that you make a note of where you left off and pick it up so that if you're interrupted, then you can pick up and go on.

10:51.847 --> 10:58.918
And I said, if you can talk about what you know and

11:00.113 --> 11:01.595
The rest of the time, keep your mouth shut.

11:02.276 --> 11:03.017
You'll be all right.

11:03.077 --> 11:06.863
I said, of course, I can't do that, but keep my mouth shut.

11:10.729 --> 11:16.257
When you did the basic English courses, you did have tests there.

11:16.658 --> 11:18.721
Oh, yes.

11:18.961 --> 11:26.593
And what was your philosophy about class attendance and makeup tests and so forth?

11:28.700 --> 11:34.368
We did what we were required, and so I was willing to give tests and take them.

11:34.869 --> 11:36.872
There were several problems that came up, though.

11:37.813 --> 11:40.517
I remember one time we were in the academic building.

11:40.617 --> 11:56.040
I was giving a final examination, and one boy stood up and started laughing, and I thought, well, I never saw any humor in this final examination, and then he fell on the floor and started to have a seizure.

11:57.623 --> 12:01.810
And he was obviously an epileptic, and I didn't know about it.

12:01.830 --> 12:08.280
And so I went and got Bo Hedgecock, whose son had been an epileptic.

12:08.300 --> 12:16.954
And he came and helped get the student and straightened out so he wouldn't hurt himself.

12:17.394 --> 12:20.199
And we sent for an ambulance, and the student was carted off.

12:21.681 --> 12:25.487
And so I—then we went on with the exam.

12:26.210 --> 12:31.319
I didn't grade the last third of the examination for the students.

12:32.521 --> 12:40.696
After that, I thought, my God, how can you answer an exam after that experience?

12:40.716 --> 12:43.982
And so I graded the students on the first part.

12:43.962 --> 12:47.147
Another time, we gave a 203 examination.

12:47.207 --> 12:54.579
We must have had 700 students in one of the big halls in Cebiza in giving a 203 examination.

12:55.741 --> 13:08.502
And the chairman of the course, who discovered that the 203 exams had been stolen,

13:08.667 --> 13:20.123
They had a whole stack of them in this one mail room, and somebody had gotten in and stolen hundreds of them, so we didn't have enough to pass out.

13:21.004 --> 13:23.608
You could go to the exam that morning.

13:23.948 --> 13:27.433
I had breakfast at Aggieland Inn that morning.

13:27.734 --> 13:31.699
You could see students having coffee and reading the 203 exam.

13:32.280 --> 13:38.168
You could see them walking along the street with them, and I thought, well, you brothers, you're going to

13:38.148 --> 13:45.444
going to have trouble here because we had substituted the substitute exam because we had copies of that.

13:45.905 --> 13:46.947
What was their reaction?

13:46.988 --> 13:49.132
Well, that was the funny part.

13:50.936 --> 13:57.591
Some of the people came up to us who were proctoring an exam and they said, are you sure this is the right examination?

13:57.571 --> 13:59.113
And some of them never knew it.

14:00.255 --> 14:02.298
In other words, they didn't even read the exam.

14:02.318 --> 14:04.982
They had their papers already written in advance.

14:05.904 --> 14:11.913
They handed in their blue books, which they had done in advance.

14:12.454 --> 14:14.417
They had never even read the exam.

14:14.437 --> 14:24.152
Some of them stayed only a minimum amount of time, you know, and then handed in their books and went out without ever realizing it.

14:24.132 --> 14:31.049
Most thought it was most unfair that we had given different examinations.

14:31.069 --> 14:41.415
We found out later that the exams had originally sold for five dollars and then it got smaller and smaller amount and finally they were given away.

14:43.910 --> 14:58.151
The department leadership in the 50s went to Dr. Abbott, who the department head, from Mayo to whom?

15:00.235 --> 15:00.695
To Morgan?

15:01.376 --> 15:07.566
No, Mayo to Morgan and then I think Dr. Anderson.

15:07.946 --> 15:08.427
John Q?

15:08.747 --> 15:09.669
John Q. Anderson.

15:09.689 --> 15:13.174
Oh, describe him because he's here when I got here.

15:14.285 --> 15:27.141
Q was a shock to everybody when John Q was made hit because they expected—I think John Hayes expected to be offered it and was insulted when he wasn't.

15:27.161 --> 15:37.795
And Freddy Eckfeldt thought to be offered it, and there were a whole line of them that expected it, you know, or be considered, and then I think

15:40.272 --> 15:47.043
The dean or somebody had jumped John Q. Anderson over the whole field because of the publications.

15:49.146 --> 16:06.634
And he was into folklore and many people claimed that his wife did half of his work and that he was using his students' work and putting his name to it too.

16:07.694 --> 16:12.279
And there were all kinds of charges like that that I didn't know anything about.

16:13.320 --> 16:23.950
But anyhow, I had several duties, such as I was on the Schedule Committee, things like that, and chairman of, I guess, speech by then.

16:25.772 --> 16:33.600
And I went in and told him I would resign in my courses so he can appoint his own people.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.823
And he said, for God's sake, don't.

16:39.352 --> 16:40.694
He said, I'm running scared.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.617
He says, I need all the help I can get.

16:43.637 --> 16:47.541
And I said, well, as long as you have that attitude, I'll stay on and help you.

16:48.602 --> 16:54.609
And he was the kind, if you did one job and did it well, you got the next one that came along.

16:56.431 --> 16:58.914
And you kept the first one.

16:58.934 --> 17:05.241
So under J.Q., I was chairman of the speech, chairman of creative writing.

17:08.005 --> 17:14.599
I was director of scheduling and finally did all of the scheduling without any help.

17:16.183 --> 17:24.681
I assigned all of the classroom, all of the offices, helped with the

17:26.838 --> 17:28.840
Some of the reports, things like that.

17:29.401 --> 17:30.763
And taught how much?

17:30.863 --> 17:31.504
Fifteen hours.

17:32.465 --> 17:34.547
Still, you had that plus the two.

17:34.748 --> 17:38.092
And then under the next three heads, and then came Lee Martin.

17:39.694 --> 17:43.979
And under Lee, I kept all of the, he was my best friend at the time.

17:45.080 --> 17:50.807
And I kept all of my old jobs and added some new acting head when he wasn't there.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.752
And then when he died, I was acting head.

17:56.065 --> 18:00.069
He went off to Mexico, and I was acting head for two weeks.

18:00.310 --> 18:06.476
And then when my appointment was about to end, I got a call from his home.

18:08.759 --> 18:12.183
And I didn't realize he was back.

18:13.084 --> 18:15.927
And I got there, and he was sick in bed.

18:18.089 --> 18:22.714
And so he said, you'll have to go on as acting head for the rest of the semester probably.

18:24.247 --> 18:27.332
And so I was acting head all that semester.

18:27.352 --> 18:27.893
When was that?

18:27.993 --> 18:28.894
All that summer session.

18:28.914 --> 18:29.856
Do you remember when that was?

18:32.400 --> 18:33.842
No, I don't remember the year exactly.

18:33.862 --> 18:34.163
Eighties?

18:34.824 --> 18:35.204
Seventies?

18:35.305 --> 18:36.707
I have no recall.

18:36.947 --> 18:37.768
I'll be honest with you.

18:38.449 --> 18:43.217
Anyhow, I was acting head all that summer.

18:44.665 --> 18:51.378
I taught my six weeks of class, and then the other was without pay for it.

18:51.398 --> 18:51.659
I did it.

18:52.060 --> 18:58.372
Then Harry Hearth was made head, and they were trying to bring in somebody from outside.

18:58.392 --> 19:03.703
I think Maxwell was dean at the time, and he wanted to bring in somebody from outside.

19:05.962 --> 19:12.028
Costa had a former head that he tried to bring in, and he was president of some school.

19:13.289 --> 19:17.813
And I asked him, why would the president of a school want to become a department head?

19:17.993 --> 19:19.955
And he said, well, so I can get my work done.

19:21.317 --> 19:26.562
I said, in other words, you're going to be a department head and somebody like me is going to do your work.

19:30.545 --> 19:35.310
And you're going to do your work and not the department's work.

19:36.387 --> 19:37.949
And he didn't deny it.

19:38.930 --> 19:43.494
He says, sounds to me like you already have made up your mind that you have somebody you'd like to hire.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.076
I said, that's absolutely true.

19:46.077 --> 19:48.600
And everybody sitting around nodded too.

19:48.660 --> 19:49.801
I said, Harry Hearth.

19:51.302 --> 19:54.065
And so we ended up with Harry Hearth's head.

19:54.165 --> 20:05.297
And then when Harry got sick, we had— Describe Dr. Hearth as department chairman.

20:08.028 --> 20:22.092
I might end up describing myself in some respects because one department member said when I told him to go, if you don't like my decision, I go check with Harry Hurst.

20:22.132 --> 20:24.536
And he said, well, huh.

20:24.556 --> 20:29.024
It's like asking me to go to somebody like you.

20:29.044 --> 20:31.588
He said, you're two peas in the pod.

20:32.243 --> 20:35.146
And we had mostly the same set of values.

20:35.286 --> 20:42.453
We both tried to do what was best for the department, the school and the faculty and the students.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.996
I mean, we tried to do what was best.

20:46.117 --> 20:52.202
And some teachers were satisfied and some were just satisfied.

20:52.222 --> 20:58.909
We had one malcontent who later never liked anything that we did.

21:00.273 --> 21:04.058
who later said, those were the golden years.

21:05.941 --> 21:11.089
And so I think in some respect, during Harry's tenure, they were the golden years.

21:11.209 --> 21:22.826
Because he was, in many respects, like Dr. Mayo, a very equitable man and a very generous man with his time.

21:23.326 --> 21:29.976
And I think he tried to do the best for everyone.

21:31.340 --> 21:40.155
stepping back in the 50s, late 50s, Earl Rudder is brought over here as the new president.

21:41.938 --> 21:49.731
How much did the changes in deans and presidents affect what was really happening in the English department?

21:51.795 --> 21:56.723
Well, under John Q. Anderson, quit because of Rudder.

21:58.627 --> 21:59.027
Really?

21:59.688 --> 22:00.389
Yes.

22:00.529 --> 22:00.970
How so?

22:01.791 --> 22:02.411
Describe that.

22:02.491 --> 22:11.482
Well, what happened was that the registrar's office had told us we were going to get this tremendous increase in enrollment.

22:13.204 --> 22:17.849
And so we had hired three new people, three or four new people.

22:19.511 --> 22:23.335
And then when the actual enrollment came in,

22:25.407 --> 22:30.091
We had lost people instead of having this tremendous increase.

22:31.973 --> 22:35.515
And so Rudder, one of these new people, fired.

22:38.838 --> 22:40.139
And John refused to fire him.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.842
Said we'd hired him in good faith.

22:43.983 --> 22:50.768
And then, of course, the people were let go the next semester.

22:50.788 --> 22:55.212
But that was a bone of contention.

22:57.082 --> 23:05.134
John quit under him because Rudder, of course, was looking at the bottom line and we didn't need them.

23:05.154 --> 23:08.179
But John was a man of conscience.

23:08.199 --> 23:11.584
How much did you and your colleagues see of Earl Rudder as president?

23:12.225 --> 23:12.986
How often were you?

23:13.246 --> 23:15.850
Well, I saw more of his dog.

23:15.830 --> 23:21.078
He had this bulldog that came to class, Sol Sarge, wasn't it, or something like that.

23:21.558 --> 23:27.307
He would come and sit in my class and he was a better student and some of them paid more attention.

23:28.509 --> 23:39.084
But I saw Rudder once, they have these summer, what do they call these freshman camps?

23:39.685 --> 23:40.146
Fish camp.

23:40.246 --> 23:40.767
Fish camps.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.491
I was asked to speak.

23:43.471 --> 24:13.444
at one of the fish camps and Rudder and I flew from Easterwood in University Plain and that was the first time I really talked to him personally was on this plane and Smith was a pilot I forget what his first name was and we flew from there to wherever the fish camp was in East Texas

24:14.639 --> 24:18.490
And I remember Reagan Brown was also on that,

24:24.089 --> 24:28.557
What was your impression of Mr. Rutter in that conversation?

24:28.577 --> 24:42.080
Well, the thing I remember, he was reading a magazine most of the time, and there was a cartoon in the magazine that delighted him, and he showed it to me.

24:42.981 --> 24:46.367
It was two cartoons, actually, that were related.

24:46.972 --> 25:04.930
It showed a couple on a desert island and in the first picture the girl is very trim and the man is pot-bellied and in the second picture the man is very trim and the girl is pot-bellied on the desert island.

25:05.146 --> 25:09.952
And that delighted him, and we had a pleasant conversation.

25:09.972 --> 25:13.136
I don't know what we talked about after that, but we got along well.

25:13.156 --> 25:18.984
And I remember asking him questions at the liberal arts meeting when he addressed the faculty.

25:21.147 --> 25:26.514
And I remembered once asking what percentage of black students we had.

25:28.857 --> 25:31.440
And he said, I don't know, and I don't want to know.

25:33.884 --> 25:46.586
And that was one of the times that—and the next time I asked him a question about what the salary ranges were in the different ranks and he seemed surprised that I didn't know.

25:47.648 --> 25:58.727
And Bloody Morgan was sitting right ahead of me and he was department head at the time and his neck got real red and afterwards he said,

26:01.238 --> 26:02.460
You embarrassed the president.

26:02.781 --> 26:08.531
I said, no, I embarrassed you because you hadn't told us.

26:08.551 --> 26:11.276
So he finally had to tell us what the ranges were.

26:12.858 --> 26:23.938
Those great changes that were made at A&M under Mr. Rutter, did you and your colleagues give him credit for being the leader of those changes?

26:25.555 --> 26:27.557
Some people wouldn't give him credit for anything.

26:28.158 --> 26:29.940
Some people thought he did a very good job.

26:31.142 --> 26:35.027
I was not impressed at first, but I ended up being impressed by the man.

26:36.068 --> 26:37.650
I thought he didn't.

26:37.670 --> 26:52.508
I thought that really it took a man like General Rudder to get by with making the core non-requirement.

26:53.585 --> 26:59.092
We would have stayed on that plateau of 5,000 students that we reached and stayed on for a long time.

26:59.613 --> 27:03.639
We would still be there if that high, if it wasn't for that change.

27:05.301 --> 27:06.603
And then the second change, women.

27:08.025 --> 27:15.595
We became a university and the English department started having majors and graduate program and all that.

27:15.915 --> 27:19.440
It all took place under him.

27:21.260 --> 27:31.029
I don't think he was a scholar or really academically oriented, but I think he did what had to be done and should be done.

27:31.449 --> 27:34.872
And I ended up thinking he was a remarkable man.

27:36.194 --> 27:40.217
And at about the same time he came, Frank Hubert came as dean.

27:41.539 --> 27:43.060
What did you and your colleagues think of him?

27:43.921 --> 27:47.364
Well, again, there was a mixed opinion.

27:49.306 --> 27:50.727
I got along very well with Frank.

27:53.086 --> 28:01.417
And I had to see him on some of the different hats I was wearing in the department.

28:01.458 --> 28:03.420
I had to go talk to him.

28:03.440 --> 28:10.150
And one of them, I remember, was about Dr. Greer.

28:10.170 --> 28:18.841
And Bloody Morgan had told me that I could—that was one time I was told what I was supposed to give in the way of a schedule.

28:18.882 --> 28:21.405
He said, you will give him 104 and nothing else.

28:22.887 --> 28:25.169
I said, well, it's terrible to put him in with freshmen.

28:28.172 --> 28:31.075
I tried to oppose it.

28:31.376 --> 28:37.762
When I was told I couldn't oppose it, I finally went to see Dean Hubert.

28:37.782 --> 28:48.793
I said, now, Dr. Morgan has told me I can give this man only freshman English.

28:49.938 --> 28:53.062
We can't do that to freshman students."

28:53.082 --> 28:59.852
I said, he doesn't teach and he's an impossible man.

29:00.553 --> 29:11.288
So I ended up, I think, giving him a broom closet in the dean's office and giving him some kind of a job to get him out of the classroom and that should have been done years before.

29:12.803 --> 29:20.796
I don't say that I was responsible for doing it because I wasn't the only one who was complaining but it just reached a point of impossibility.

29:22.058 --> 29:29.130
He was the closest thing we had at the time to a Shakespeare scholar and he wasn't given 212 Shakespeare.

29:30.272 --> 29:34.238
Now at about that time Mr. Rudder dies.

29:35.197 --> 29:45.037
Jack Williams comes as president and arts and science is divided into a number of colleges and Dave Maxwell becomes the dean.

29:46.961 --> 29:56.040
Williams learned about communications ten years after the fact and he wanted to divide

29:57.522 --> 30:06.794
the English department up and send part of them to journalism and create a communication department.

30:06.975 --> 30:08.076
You're saying Williams did?

30:08.096 --> 30:10.780
Williams did.

30:10.820 --> 30:19.772
We were going to end up with, I think freshman English was going to be divided into something and all that.

30:19.912 --> 30:26.601
And when Dave Stewart came, I again was acting head because Harry was in the hospital.

30:28.657 --> 30:34.869
And so I was supposed to teach him the ropes.

30:36.392 --> 30:46.632
And so one thing that I really admired about Dave was I told him, I said, now you're going to have to have a fight on your hands with the president.

30:47.236 --> 30:54.849
Because he wants, you may end up without any freshman, without any technical writing, without any speech, and so on.

30:54.989 --> 30:57.192
And I said, you better go talk to him.

30:57.232 --> 31:03.403
And so he took off and he nipped a lot of those original changes in the bud at that time.

31:04.244 --> 31:06.668
Did Dave Maxwell have a part in any of that either?

31:07.529 --> 31:08.090
I don't know.

31:08.611 --> 31:08.992
I don't know.

31:09.112 --> 31:10.915
I got along very well with Maxwell.

31:11.958 --> 31:14.764
because he was a man that you could object.

31:14.784 --> 31:17.590
I'm a great objector.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.389
He and I had one run in right at the start.
