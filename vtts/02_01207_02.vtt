WEBVTT

00:01.870 --> 00:17.326
We

00:01.870 --> 00:17.326
were discussing whether or not we would have 
changed our our approach or whether the

00:01.870 --> 00:17.326
profession should have changed their approach 
and what was your comment on that? Well I started to

00:17.867 --> 00:31.641
say you know when we graduated we thought we were 
pretty well pretty knowledgeable and some of the

00:17.867 --> 00:31.641
old vet old vets around that been around for a while 
we thought they were kind of back woodsy and I

00:32.397 --> 01:02.168
worked with Dr. Bailey and taught that old vet 
school back in the 1920s, 18, 1918

00:32.397 --> 01:02.168
and all right after World War I and think about the 
type of practice he carried on and he carried on a

00:32.397 --> 01:02.168
pretty good, pretty smart operator and I think of 
what the new graduates have to go through and I

00:32.397 --> 01:02.168
think I'm way behind time now and can't catch up. 
Well, all these autoimmune diseases and so forth

01:05.908 --> 01:12.475
take a lot more knowledge than what we were exposed 
to then. Of course, we've kept up with a lot of it,

01:12.535 --> 01:28.373
but wouldn't you say perhaps that since you and I 
graduated, they've learned about as much about

01:12.535 --> 01:28.373
animal disease since we graduated as we were 
exposed to in school and before? That's right. I

01:29.775 --> 01:32.037
think we... Of course, I think about old that 
bacteriology merchant giving us all his wisdom

01:32.472 --> 01:50.391
and how much farther what we didn't know about 
viruses in those days, don't you? Yes, and

01:50.631 --> 01:51.812
immunity. Yeah, immunity and I look at the old book 
textbook every once in a while I think we'll all

01:57.650 --> 02:04.779
have to admit that the advent of chick embryo 
vaccines really helped a lot because here they

01:57.650 --> 02:04.779
could grow it without having to have an animal. All 
they needed was the eggs. That's right. And it's

02:07.522 --> 02:09.264
helped a lot. See, they started that chick embryo 
there at St. Joe Laboratories. I think about all

02:15.592 --> 02:24.923
the eggs and eggs and thousands and thousands of 
eggs that they run through that place down there on

02:15.592 --> 02:24.923
the river bottom.

02:28.615 --> 02:45.598
The,

02:28.615 --> 02:45.598
what do you think about, I

02:28.615 --> 02:45.598
was going to ask you some questions about 
organized veterinary medicine, but I want to put

02:28.615 --> 02:45.598
that on a separate tape. Let me ask you this, I feel 
that during our practice life, there is a

02:45.658 --> 02:52.648
possibility that the clients have changed, and 
that as times have gone, we're supposed to be more

02:53.422 --> 03:00.048
intelligent and so forth, and approach to things. 
Aren't clients considerably more critical and

03:01.189 --> 03:07.054
expect a whole lot more than they did when we first 
went into practice? For instance, were people

03:09.496 --> 03:16.802
pleased, more easily pleased with what you could 
do then than even they are now? You

03:16.842 --> 03:22.106
mean pleased now or pleased then? Pleased then. 
well if you could keep your dog alive back in those

03:23.476 --> 03:51.846
days well you're pretty pretty good you know if you 
didn't let it die with distemper if you kept it got

03:23.476 --> 03:51.846
it through distemper i don't know whether you went 
through those distemper times or not uh that we i

03:23.476 --> 03:51.846
remember them from north carolina a lot and we 
didn't have real active immunity and then your dog

03:23.476 --> 03:51.846
would break with that It's not no distemper that 
we'd see. It just wasn't anything you could do. I

04:00.950 --> 04:03.153
mean, what did you fight it with? Well, of course, 
whatever we used, it seems the outcome was the same

04:03.494 --> 04:17.652
as about what you said, but I felt with distemper, 
if you had a client that could do the nurse's dog and

04:03.494 --> 04:17.652
the dog didn't get encephalitis, you had it made. 
You had it made. You could bring... We used to

04:19.433 --> 04:20.634
vaccinate them. That was what the old Fox people 
wanted. They wanted one that was actively immune.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.324
He didn't want one that was going to break after you 
got him out and started running him. And we put him

04:30.805 --> 04:38.293
in just what we call the distemper ward and wait 
till the temperature rise and try to fight him

04:30.805 --> 04:38.293
down. That's the way we did it. I mean, they did it. I 
didn't. I wasn't a vet. I was just a student in a

04:42.737 --> 04:46.241
kennel band at that time. And I remember it's so bad 
it was pretty bad. Do you recall hard pad disease in

04:50.587 --> 04:53.231
the late 40s? I remember the hard pad disease when 
it hit and came supposed to have come from England

04:53.251 --> 05:09.317
and you'd get a dog on a table and you'd hear him his 
feet scratching the table and you just about as

04:53.251 --> 05:09.317
well kiss him goodbye as I remember it. Now have you 
seen one lately? I've seen one or two lately I mean

05:15.020 --> 05:16.562
No, not very many. Maybe a couple last year. I 
haven't, I don't know if I've seen any this year,

05:18.525 --> 05:23.292
but I know I saw a couple last year. We used to get, we 
get an awful lot of snake bites. Get a lot of, a lot of

05:29.621 --> 05:36.330
snake bites here due to the location of our 
practice.

05:38.554 --> 05:40.717
Used to get quite a few thallium poisons. Don't see 
much thallium anymore. Used to a lot of strychnine

05:44.720 --> 05:47.042
don't you think? Yeah I see quite a few strychnine 
now I've had some recent poilings that I don't know

05:47.562 --> 05:59.353
whether there's somebody got any 1080 or not but 
I'm beginning to think we've got some 1080

05:47.562 --> 05:59.353
floating around. I saw a thing on TV the other night 
that they were getting going to get 1080 back for

06:00.073 --> 06:13.765
coyotes up in the hill country from Brown Brady I 
think or someplace up in there and that 1080 is a I

06:14.926 --> 06:16.648
don't think you can do any good for it. I never have 
found anything. Do you have ever, have you ever

06:19.571 --> 06:21.634
found anything? No, we don't have much down there, 
fortunately. I got in a new poison the other day

06:24.397 --> 06:29.343
from California. I don't know that I got it. It's a 
rat poison that they use in California, and the

06:31.065 --> 06:41.777
stuff is So toxic. I mean, I called a veterinarian 
out there. And he told me about it. What they can't

06:51.098 --> 06:54.601
remember the name of it. Let's see.

06:59.847 --> 07:02.650
But it is, he said it was rough. And he said, don't 
think you've got them cured until you've been a

07:03.031 --> 07:08.497
long time. Gone by. Let me ask you another 
question. You know, when we first got into

07:14.135 --> 07:22.883
practice, we thought that the cat disease was 
infectious panleukopenia. What do you think

07:24.785 --> 07:27.107
about viral diseases in cats now? I'm kind of lost. 
I'm not very

07:30.251 --> 07:36.337
up-to-date on it, I'm afraid. I'll have to admit, I 
wonder when I see some of these pictures our

07:43.317 --> 08:10.624
literature coming out and the new vaccine the 
calcivirus and whatnot I wonder if we haven't had

07:43.317 --> 08:10.624
that all along didn't know what we had how about you 
well without a doubt we had some of it before but the

07:43.317 --> 08:10.624
feline infectious anemia we had then 
hemobartonella also the feline infectious

07:43.317 --> 08:10.624
peritonitis with the swelled tummies we've had 
that for long time, but I really think perhaps that

08:11.347 --> 08:22.759
this feline leukemia perhaps is relatively 
recent.

08:23.740 --> 08:29.486
The cats just seem to get cat decline, and many of 
those are positive leukemia. You found that

08:29.926 --> 08:31.187
poison? Yeah. What's it called? Ramek Green. How 
does that spell? R-A-M-I-C-K. G-R-E-E-N.

08:39.730 --> 08:48.504
And it's Velsicol KRL, is that what it's called? 
Yeah, ceramic green is the name of it, I think. And

08:52.070 --> 08:52.871
it's a... It's not like decon, is it? Yeah, it's a 
decon type thing, but he says it works. I call it Dr.

08:57.479 --> 09:01.165
Christie in California. He said it was very bad 
like decon like poisoning and the vitamin K blood

09:02.309 --> 09:17.044
transfusions and everything he said it was he had 
treated it though for this lady and she had moved

09:02.309 --> 09:17.044
here from California and I called and talked to 
him.

09:20.387 --> 09:27.214
Well uh what other observations you have on 
veterinary medicine you think it's been good to

09:20.387 --> 09:27.214
you? Been good to me I've had nothing but I've 
enjoyed my practice for years. Really, I'm

09:34.472 --> 09:54.271
probably not as good an up-to-date veterinarian 
as I could have been, but I think I've served the

09:34.472 --> 09:54.271
community about as well as anybody could from the 
standpoint of taking care of large animals, small

09:34.472 --> 09:54.271
animals in the hall. Now, you can't be a general 
practitioner and do it all, and and be an expert in

09:59.566 --> 10:28.780
in everything but uh an area that can't support a 
veterinarian needs a general practitioner and

09:59.566 --> 10:28.780
when you have a small animal man move in and do 
nothing in an area that needs this large animal man

09:59.566 --> 10:28.780
i'm kind of critical of that and i have been 
outspoken on it i think it's uh the day of the

09:59.566 --> 10:28.780
general practitioner they say is gone but i in the 
small community you better be able to do a little of

10:29.435 --> 10:57.180
everything when these clients go to a 
veterinarian and he says I don't treat anything

10:29.435 --> 10:57.180
but dogs and cats and the people don't like it 
especially if there's nobody else who can take

10:29.435 --> 10:57.180
care of them within 100 miles but in general on 
large animals with the exception of horses isn't

10:29.435 --> 10:57.180
the era of the small herd finished where you have 
maybe have a half dozen cows and they call you out

10:57.903 --> 11:05.832
for dystopia and whatnot that sort of thing is 
almost gone. Those things are gone. When I came to

11:07.053 --> 11:20.167
this area here I used to come in here when I was still 
in Corpus come into this area here and I'd test 40,

11:07.053 --> 11:20.167
50 cows for bangs and TB and- Not all the same herd. 
Well no two cows here three cows in another place

11:20.527 --> 11:27.555
five over here and I'd have to hunt hard to find one 
or two milk cows right now. There are no milk cows

11:31.042 --> 11:32.264
out. No dairy, no small farmers. They all get their 
milk out of a cardboard carton. And your practice,

11:39.794 --> 11:47.745
as far as Lardown was, there's very little family 
type like we used to have. This area used to be a

11:47.785 --> 11:56.817
rural community with lots of two or three cow 
people. milk cows that milked them, but they're

11:57.067 --> 12:01.852
just not here anymore. You'd starve to death. But 
by the same token, you need somebody to take care of

12:05.876 --> 12:21.312
what cows there are and what horses there are, and 
we have a lot of just nothing but small animal men in

12:05.876 --> 12:21.312
the area, and they can't be a large animal man. Now, 
we've got a new large animal man in the area, and

12:21.452 --> 12:25.977
he's doing very well. keep doing small animal and 
large animals but we've had three and four of them

12:27.644 --> 12:55.997
in the in the general area that wouldn't wouldn't 
look at a cow in their backyard wouldn't help their

12:27.644 --> 12:55.997
neighbor even I've been in the backyard of the vets 
and the ranches and backyards of ones in Rockport

12:27.644 --> 12:55.997
and uh they just won't touch them and I I don't think 
it's it's right that you they better call a man 20 20

12:56.568 --> 12:59.112
miles off when they're sitting right in his 
backyard. That's the way I feel now. If a man has to

13:04.058 --> 13:23.345
call a vet from 25, 30, 40 miles away and still has a 
vet in his backyard that won't treat anything

13:04.058 --> 13:23.345
because he's either not qualified or he's scared 
to death of large animals, you know what I'm

13:04.058 --> 13:23.345
talking about. And they don't like it. and I'm 
critical of that fact and they say well you can't do

13:25.323 --> 13:49.356
both but if he if he moves in and treats nothing but 
dogs and cats and the closest vet is 30 miles away

13:25.323 --> 13:49.356
and a large animal man can't make it on in that area 
by himself I think he's it's bad You can't help but

13:50.062 --> 13:57.213
notice as the veterinary graduates come out of the 
schools now that about half the graduates are

13:50.062 --> 13:57.213
women. Yeah. Have you adjusted to that? I'm not 
against the women veterinarians. I just don't

14:03.723 --> 14:09.733
know whether they can do any work out in the, as much 
work out in the field. They may be a cowgirl that can

14:10.173 --> 14:18.246
get out and wrestle cattle and take and do the jobs 
that we've done in the past. Maybe the rancher's

14:19.087 --> 14:28.363
going to do his own OB work, do everything like 
that. Maybe this woman's going out and do some of

14:28.463 --> 14:33.953
the work that I've done in the past, but I don't 
believe she is. I don't think she's going out and

14:35.716 --> 14:39.542
wrassling these herds around. Maybe she will, but 
I just don't believe it.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.030
Yeah, I haven't seen it yet. I know they do pretty 
good in a small animal practice.

14:53.979 --> 15:01.991
Would you feel that obviously a

14:53.979 --> 15:01.991
lot of these women aren't staying in practice? Do 
you think it's a waste of the taxpayers money in a

15:02.011 --> 15:09.563
lot of cases to uh- I saw some something some uh 
research or literature or something on people

15:12.142 --> 15:39.550
women staying in practice here the other day said 
that the women were staying in small animal

15:12.142 --> 15:39.550
practice about as good as the large as the men were 
in in small animal practice uh

15:12.142 --> 15:39.550
I don't know whether that's true or not but I it was 
in I think the latest southwestern veterinarian

15:12.142 --> 15:39.550
talking about was that right yeah I'll have to get 
that magazine. It's over at the house. We can let

15:44.729 --> 15:47.812
you look at it, read it. I'd like to see that 
statistic. I think it's in there. I'm not

15:51.295 --> 15:55.398
positive, but I read a little bit at night until my 
eyes go bad. Let's change the subject a little bit,

15:55.979 --> 16:04.166
and it's part of the same subject but really 
different. One of the big things that veterinary

16:04.186 --> 16:09.250
medicine does or veterinary medicine needs is 
enough camaraderie and enough sharing and

16:10.816 --> 16:23.871
pooling of thought and ideas so that we can help 
each other help the public. When you first came

16:23.891 --> 16:32.060
from school and came down here in Corpus Christi, 
what was organized veterinary medicine like at

16:23.891 --> 16:32.060
that time to your way of looking at it? There wasn't 
much of an organization as far as I know of. We got

16:35.764 --> 16:38.427
maybe We'd get together once in a while over a meal, 
and that was about it, and talk about it. Who were

16:46.157 --> 16:50.101
the veterinarians at that time here in Corpus 
Christi who participated in that? We had Dr. Dunn.

16:52.183 --> 16:56.187
What were his initials?

16:56.207 --> 16:59.090
I don't know. I think S.E., but I'm not. Dr. Oberg. 
Oh, yes. What were his initials? Don't ask me those

17:04.456 --> 17:05.857
questions. Oberg. came down from Nebraska. He was 
a real hog specialist, swine specialist up in his

17:10.044 --> 17:24.960
field and he came down here I think due to bad health 
and all and he practiced. If you had a hog problem

17:24.980 --> 17:26.842
you'd call him. I mean he was a large animal man. Dr. 
Dunn was the veterinarian for from south of all

17:28.584 --> 17:36.893
south Texas so to speak. He practiced from the You 
might say Victoria to the Laredo, all of that

17:38.802 --> 17:44.630
point. There wasn't another vent in the country. 
And he covered from Victoria over towards Laredo

17:47.475 --> 17:57.489
and all of that area south of that. And he was gone 
most of the time. And then he had Dr. Fondren came in

18:00.233 --> 18:05.200
from San Antonio. Fondren moved here. came in to 
work with Dr. Dunn at that time and he had an old

18:07.928 --> 18:30.249
graduate army sergeant or whatever you want 
working for him at the time, Dr. Dunn did and that

18:07.928 --> 18:30.249
was all that was in Corpus except Dr. Springs 
Hospital. And you all got together, did you? We got

18:32.031 --> 18:35.674
together and talked things over and the doctor We 
had a few meetings. Then Dr. Brandes and Hoban and

18:38.149 --> 18:48.501
later Dr. Pruitt, I think we all got together and 
started a little meeting. And the first

18:49.423 --> 18:56.471
organization was a meeting, I think we organized 
about 50. 1950

18:56.491 --> 19:06.083
was about the first time we really called it a 
Coastal Bend Veterinary Group. And that included

19:07.430 --> 19:11.195
where, from Alice and Kingsville on? Yeah, we had 
Kingsville, we had Thal Fuerst, Dr. Saxton came

19:11.215 --> 19:36.171
over,

19:11.215 --> 19:36.171
Dr. Scotty out of Beeville, and Scotty McNeil, and 
uh, Botard, when he graduated, he went to

19:11.215 --> 19:36.171
Kingsville, and uh, We got together maybe once a 
month. We met over at Kingsville at King's Inn a

19:39.668 --> 19:58.285
couple times, and then we, usually we'd just have a 
meeting where we'd get together, and then I think

19:39.668 --> 19:58.285
it was, according to Hoban, we organized in about 
1950. Oh, yes. He was first secretary, and I was

20:01.228 --> 20:05.972
first president of our group. Was Dr. Spring there 
at that time? Dr. Spring was leaving. He left long

20:10.599 --> 20:12.661
about that time. I had brought the hospital. Dr. 
Spriggle was working for me and

20:15.244 --> 20:36.246
we'd get together and hoping Oberg would come, 
some, until he, you know, and we'd invite them all

20:15.244 --> 20:36.246
and try to get them to come in and Just talk things 
over. That was the first organization we had.

20:40.772 --> 20:43.316
Brandis and Pruitt came along about that time, 
didn't they? Yeah, they moved in about that time.

20:44.998 --> 20:47.462
And they were quite active, weren't they? They 
built their hospitals, and they had one, and then

20:48.363 --> 20:58.638
they moved out on the highway out there 
afterwards. Yes. Down through the years, who's

20:59.399 --> 21:04.306
been the most faithful and more or less keeping you 
going here in Corpus Christi? Well, after I left,

21:04.326 --> 21:05.608
too. Of course I left there in 56, 57 I think. 
Doctor,

21:10.499 --> 21:22.858
well I know Paget has probably kept the thing going 
as much as anybody. I see. I think. He and his wife

21:24.701 --> 21:25.582
too? Yeah. He sent out letters and all. Now we've 
got the- What's the name of his receptionist? Dr.

21:34.242 --> 21:37.046
Slater is that woman veterinarian, I think. She's 
the secretary now. She sends out all the notices.

21:40.651 --> 21:42.454
And I haven't been too active recently. I kind of 
slid out of it. I went to their Christmas party this

21:45.558 --> 21:50.325
year, and that's about the last time I've been. I 
just don't go much. They have so many new

21:54.010 --> 21:56.734
veterinarians, 20 or 30 of them. Dr. Fry moved in. 
The two Frys, Dr. Fry and... both of those are

22:02.677 --> 22:04.659
pretty active too. And I

22:05.820 --> 22:19.855
know Dr. Scotty McNeil and I drove to Abilene to try 
to reorganize the state association, you know.

22:22.518 --> 22:26.642
We had the state association meeting here one 
time. 1965.

22:31.617 --> 22:31.997
Right. Well, that was the second one, I think. Oh, 
okay. We had one before that. Okay. And Dr. Grist

22:38.364 --> 22:40.667
organized it. He was the secretary at that time. 
And Dr. Blunt was active in the state association.

22:50.557 --> 22:51.078
I don't know what he was. Later. Huh? Later. Yeah, 
but Dr. Grist was the original. He organized our

22:56.023 --> 22:59.567
first meeting in Corpus. Yes. came down and made 
all the contacts and hotels and arrangements for

23:00.220 --> 23:06.748
meeting rooms and everything else. And he could 
tell you more about it than I can. I can't remember

23:11.414 --> 23:14.017
that meeting. Was I in the service then? I may have 
been. Probably was. Yes. That was the first

23:18.022 --> 23:30.177
meeting we had was in, along about that time, I 
think it was probably in 49, 50, right about the

23:18.022 --> 23:30.177
time we tried to reorganize after the meeting here 
with I know we went to Abilene and they hired some

23:32.063 --> 23:40.331
public relations man to kick us off and whatnot. 
Yes. I don't know whether you remember that or not.

23:43.274 --> 23:49.600
Well, I know I don't really recall that, but I, 
again, I may not have been here. As far as you know,

23:49.660 --> 23:54.985
they didn't keep a set of written records here in 
the Coastal Bend Association, right? So far

23:55.005 --> 23:56.847
nobody can find it. If they did, I mean, Hoban I was 
secretary at the time. We didn't have much of an

24:01.072 --> 24:08.940
organization as far as dues or just kind of a get 
together to talk things over. What was going on,

24:09.160 --> 24:14.245
you know, was all it was. It wasn't a very fancy 
organization. Now, I forgot one vet that was here

24:19.790 --> 24:22.933
that was kind of active. It was Dr. Judson, you 
know. had a pretty nice little hospital there for

24:25.861 --> 24:29.105
you. He was pretty active. He passed on, is that 
right? Yeah, he died. He had cancer of the throat.

24:37.355 --> 24:40.299
Judson was...

24:42.922 --> 24:45.725
He was born about what year, about 1920? I imagine 
he was about our age, 20, and he was brought up down

24:46.166 --> 24:55.277
in Mexico by Mexican I mean, he spoke Mexican real 
good, and he set up his practice there in the Port

24:56.084 --> 25:07.122
Ayers community right north of Hoban's a little 
ways, and he had a pretty nice little hospital, you

24:56.084 --> 25:07.122
know. Judson did. Yes. What was his first name? 
William. William. I've got it easy. And he's been

25:13.933 --> 25:15.315
gone how many years? He probably died in 50, 60, 
about 60-something. I don't remember exactly. I

25:29.247 --> 25:30.108
went to his funeral. I went to his marriage when he 
got married. See, he didn't get married early, and

25:33.191 --> 25:45.045
he was still... What's the current status of the 
Veterinary Association here? You don't really

25:45.065 --> 25:46.687
know much about it. I'm not active. I know I went to 
the Christmas party out at the Fry's house.

25:55.853 --> 26:00.217
There's so many young ones and stuff, I feel kind of 
like a lost goose out there. Was there a Holcomb

26:01.278 --> 26:07.724
here, you know?

26:07.744 --> 26:14.670
There's a bunch of them in Portland, and Dr. Bauer 
is in Portland. We got two or three others in

26:15.070 --> 26:16.992
Portland. We got the one in Taft now. go. Dr. the 
real McCoy's in Senton. Think about TDMA? Yes.

26:27.999 --> 26:35.667
Well I have been a member off and on and I'm not a 
member up in good standing right now I don't think.

26:35.767 --> 26:38.870
I'm kind of dropped out. I'll have to talk you into 
that again. What? I'll have to talk you into that

26:42.133 --> 26:43.575
again. Yeah well I've been a member and Barb was 
president of the TVMA Auxiliary, you know. I was

26:52.779 --> 27:03.910
active along in there, you know, but I kind of 
dropped out when you don't go to meetings, and I

26:52.779 --> 27:03.910
guess you just get old. Lazy, don't want to go. No, 
I'd like to

27:07.934 --> 27:15.022
probably keep my membership. Dr. Spring let his 
license expire. Well, but he, where's he living

27:19.640 --> 27:23.445
now? He's 72, you know, and he figured, well, I'm 
not going to do much practice. He let his license,

27:29.332 --> 27:44.550
he didn't renew it in time, and, you know, just kind 
of one of those things that by that time his wife's

27:29.332 --> 27:44.550
real sick, and he's had a triple bypass, and he 
didn't get his membership in, so he's He said, I'd

27:45.222 --> 27:49.765
kind of like to have it, but it's not that 
important, you know.

27:53.069 --> 28:04.285
At this same time or on the same day, I had a 
telephone conversation with Dr. Martin Pigott in

27:53.069 --> 28:04.285
regard to the history of the Coastal Bend 
Veterinary Medical Association. He said when he

28:05.406 --> 28:18.925
was first there, which we have discussed in 
regards to Dr. Haubutzel's beginning here, they

28:05.406 --> 28:18.925
started relatively informally and then it built 
up and built up. to the point where they were

28:18.905 --> 28:34.618
actually having formal dinner meetings and 
having them program every time and so forth and

28:18.905 --> 28:34.618
then worked off after that into seminars and for 
three years They had a lot of very heavy technical

28:35.155 --> 28:38.979
seminars. They would, of course, discuss very 
highly technical aspects of clinical medicine

28:40.261 --> 28:48.890
and practice and so forth and so on. Then following 
that, some of them more or less were burned out, not

28:49.991 --> 29:04.707
so much the dinner meeting, but they were burned 
out on all this technical material.

29:05.446 --> 29:17.103
They filled their minds with a lot of things and 
felt that they really weren't helping their

29:05.446 --> 29:17.103
clientele a whole lot with a lot of this material, 
especially as regards the service they were

29:05.446 --> 29:17.103
giving their clientele. And the meetings then 
became less formal. And instead of having dinner

29:20.488 --> 29:29.040
meetings, they'd meet in a place, order off the 
menu if needed to do that, or just meet separately.

29:29.611 --> 29:43.728
and became much, much less formal and they would 
discuss problems in regards to the management and

29:29.611 --> 29:43.728
helping their clients and so forth and so on and 
became less formal. Now this increased formality

29:43.748 --> 29:52.598
began about a year ago and of course this is the year 
1982.

29:53.725 --> 30:07.532
So with that, we can see the vagaries and the 
fluctuations of emphasis in practice and how

29:53.725 --> 30:07.532
veterinary medicine is going to aid the public.
