WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:07.207
I didn't make the entire operation on about the 
seventh or eighth day. I was with a patrol that had

00:09.211 --> 00:19.848
gone out to try to establish contact with the point 
elements of the enemy division to see exactly

00:09.211 --> 00:19.848
where they were. We knew we were close, but we 
didn't exactly know where their strength was. A

00:26.573 --> 00:28.215
lot of patrols were being sent out. The patrol I was 
with, I wasn't in charge. A second lieutenant was

00:31.079 --> 00:32.481
in charge. I was the assistant patrol leader. At 
that time, I was a platoon sergeant. We ran into an

00:40.233 --> 00:53.072
enemy patrol that just so happened by misfortune 
to be coming south while we were going north.

00:53.626 --> 00:58.313
The point groups of each patrol exchanged fire. 
They had a larger patrol than we did, and they

00:58.573 --> 01:03.641
rapidly gained fire superiority. We started 
shooting from the hip, falling back. We got

01:06.425 --> 01:09.990
disoriented, and we got separated because of the 
terrain. Very thick undergrowth. It was a high

01:13.134 --> 01:16.139
canopy of jungle overhead. There was a lot of 
smoke. There was a lot of dust. There was mortar

01:19.263 --> 01:20.845
fire coming in. I was backing up, shooting from the 
hip. And my magazine made that particular noise it

01:23.731 --> 01:31.059
does, or my rifle, when you hit an empty magazine. 
And it was pretty quick, the empty one, when you

01:31.659 --> 01:34.783
were in that situation. I was trying to change 
magazines, but still backing up. And somehow I

01:38.126 --> 01:47.376
stepped out into space, stepped over a creek bank, 
fell about eight or nine feet down to some rocks

01:38.126 --> 01:47.376
below.

01:48.014 --> 01:52.586
being scared and having bit off more than we could 
chew. And it looked like, from what we could tell at

01:52.666 --> 01:56.015
that time, we'd run into a whole battalion. I don't 
think it was really that big, but it felt like it.

01:58.501 --> 02:00.707
The fire was that heavy. I was separated at that 
point from anybody else in the patrol. There was no

02:04.545 --> 02:05.787
other Americans around. I was moving down this 
creek. It was pretty shallow, about ankle-deep

02:07.509 --> 02:11.795
water, a lot of rocks, overhanging vines. 
Finally, I ran into two more guys that were

02:13.157 --> 02:18.464
crouched in the creek bed, and we started going 
back together. The lieutenant had been killed

02:18.484 --> 02:22.229
outright. Most of the first squad had been pretty 
well taken out. We grouped up with some others.

02:29.099 --> 02:30.240
There were a couple of wounded men. We started 
carrying them. All told, it was about nine or 10 of

02:33.408 --> 02:35.270
us. We worked our way back into our lines. Being 
that I was the assistant patrol leader, I gave the

02:39.034 --> 02:46.442
report as to what we had seen. And I gave my 
estimation as to what the enemy strength was. And I

02:49.626 --> 02:52.188
identified on the map as to where we met contact. 
And that was really all I could do, as close as I

02:52.208 --> 02:59.196
could tell, which is pretty confusing. By this 
time, the battalion area was coming under fire.

03:03.964 --> 03:07.789
Mortar fire, 120-millimeter Russian rockets was 
coming in. The battalion commander told me, it was

03:09.091 --> 03:17.562
a good report, I guess it was, he said that I needed 
to get over to BAS and get my leg tended to. It was

03:17.983 --> 03:22.730
only then that I noticed that from my knee down, see 
that scar there? I took a piece of shrapnel, it

03:24.212 --> 03:28.137
worked its way in along that bone and worked up 
under my knee. And I had my whole combat boot and my

03:28.808 --> 03:32.338
whole lower leg was solid blood. And I hadn't even 
realized that I thought I was wet because of the

03:32.719 --> 03:38.616
creek, which I'd been walking in. And so as soon as 
that evening, right before it got dark, they

03:39.372 --> 03:44.820
medevaced me out. They put a tag on me. And I wasn't 
considered bad off to get immediate evacuation. I

03:50.028 --> 03:52.171
went out with a second group of evacuees. They took 
me back to a field hospital that was set up at Dong

03:52.732 --> 03:55.916
Ha. And then they gave me sodium pentothal there. I 
was more tired than I was hurt, because we'd been on

04:01.725 --> 04:05.110
our feet for days. And then I was put into a C-123, 
flying boxcar-type aircraft. It had racks,

04:12.186 --> 04:16.433
stretchers along both sides. And they gave me salt 
water intravenously because of the Dehydration.

04:26.482 --> 04:31.712
We'd been without water, and it was real hot 
anyway, and then with the fire they'd set that we'd

04:26.482 --> 04:31.712
been fighting for days, too. It was just extreme 
heat. We'd lost a lot of men, too. Sunstroke, heat

04:34.817 --> 04:36.180
exhaustion. And I kind of passed out. I don't 
remember what happened, but I came to, and I was at

04:39.366 --> 04:43.854
Da Nang General Hospital back in the rear. And I 
spent three days there, and then they... sent me by

04:48.104 --> 04:51.388
helicopter out to the hospital ship repose. And I 
recuperated out there for a period of time, which I

04:51.408 --> 04:55.152
thoroughly enjoyed. They had nurses there, and 
they had milkshakes, and it was great. I hated to

04:58.116 --> 04:58.716
leave. The outfit, in the meantime, had gone ahead 
and blunted the attack of the North Vietnamese

04:59.477 --> 05:04.864
Division. By the time I got back, I got back in time. 
When I rejoined my outfit, I was walking with a

05:10.010 --> 05:12.472
cane. And I was considered a part of the sick, lame, 
and lazy, is what they called them. were excused

05:17.720 --> 05:19.402
from full duty. We had received a bunch of 
replacements and about 300 men to the battalion,

05:21.924 --> 05:27.690
but the battalion was still out in the field. So 
being one of the senior NCOs that was at that time in

05:28.391 --> 05:36.419
the rear, I found billets for these people and 
tried to get weapons issued to them. People that

05:36.439 --> 05:38.641
came over, replacements didn't come with rifles. 
We issued them rifles in country. We issued all

05:40.383 --> 05:42.225
their equipment right there. They were raw. Most 
of them had no more than eight weeks training. All

05:46.863 --> 05:47.263
of them. The highest ranking person there was a 
lance corporal that had been in the service maybe

05:47.303 --> 05:52.007
six months. Most of them were right out of boot 
camp.

05:56.291 --> 06:02.497
I also had the duty of having to identify the dead 
from the battalion because we'd taken a lot of

05:56.291 --> 06:02.497
casualties on this operation. So I had to go up to 
the body bag area. I saw my best friend. That got me

06:08.923 --> 06:10.024
kind of shook up. We was opening up the body bags and 
A guy that I'd been in boot camp with, and served two

06:13.897 --> 06:21.609
tours of duty in Vietnam with, and been to Okinawa 
with, and across the water with. In fact, he had

06:21.649 --> 06:24.073
been to my home several times. Good friend. It was 
really a shock to identify these bodies. It was

06:31.726 --> 06:34.470
most of my outfit, it seemed like at the time. I 
remember walking away from there. I was so shook

06:35.997 --> 06:36.818
up. I think I was even crying. To tell you the truth, 
it sounds bad. It didn't sound bad. It was pretty

06:43.264 --> 06:44.765
rough. When you have people that you know that 
you've cut up with and laughed with and joked with

06:45.946 --> 06:57.236
and worked with, and suddenly you're opening up 
little green bags and looking at them and saying,

06:45.946 --> 06:57.236
this is so-and-so and that's so-and-so. But they 
had to have a positive idea on everybody. We all

07:01.179 --> 07:03.141
wore dog tags, but... Many times the dog tags 
weren't on for somebody when they found them for

07:03.442 --> 07:07.988
various reasons. And then a lot of times some of us 
took our dog tags off when we went out on night

07:08.869 --> 07:13.997
patrols because they jingled. And we didn't want 
anything to make a noise. So there was a lot of

07:16.620 --> 07:19.604
reasons, but everybody didn't have a dog tag. So we 
had to go by where we could identify them by

07:20.546 --> 07:24.491
somebody that knew them. Sometimes you couldn't 
even do that. After Operation Hastings, I...

07:30.948 --> 07:37.775
wrangled with a battalion sergeant major five 
days R&R in Bangkok, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

07:37.795 --> 07:43.260
And I won't go into that, but... Prostitutes, 
booze, and bras, huh? Well, it was a... Don't

07:43.280 --> 07:46.764
worry, your wife won't hear this. It was a great 
relief from where I'd been. And the people in

07:49.206 --> 07:53.290
Thailand made us feel very welcome. I say that, 
that I will always be indebted to the Thai people.

07:57.214 --> 07:58.896
They treated us so kind. Their kindness was just 
unbelievable. Even when we didn't have money,

08:01.656 --> 08:05.670
they still treated us kind, which was very 
unusual. Most American GIs had learned when the

08:05.731 --> 08:10.287
money runs out, the kindness runs out. But I have to 
say, as a tribute to those people, to my dying day,

08:10.402 --> 08:17.291
I'll remember the Thai people for their kindness. 
Of course, they were concerned about the

08:18.853 --> 08:24.079
Vietnamese coming into Thailand, and they very 
much are pro-American in Thailand. It's one of our

08:24.400 --> 08:26.723
staunch allies there. My uncle flew out of 
Thailand. His base is in Thailand. He flew across

08:28.685 --> 08:30.968
Cambodia and Laos and bombed. Thailand is a 
country I will always admire, and someday, if I

08:32.430 --> 08:38.738
have a chance, I'll go back to Bangkok and take my 
family, because it's a... It's a kind city, and at

08:39.629 --> 08:42.532
that time, it was made up of kind people. I remember 
that. I was given free meals. I was given free

08:46.536 --> 08:48.018
liquor. I won't go into all the things that was free 
in Thailand, but it was a nice place. It was five

08:55.366 --> 08:57.128
days of relief. And it was like going from hell to 
heaven, the comparison. But then I had to go back to

09:04.596 --> 09:05.957
Vietnam. I remember the day came, and the hotel 
people came around and woke us all up that was

09:06.629 --> 09:10.293
there. They did it with the greatest kindness. 
They said they were really sorry to tell us, but we

09:13.357 --> 09:16.460
had to leave. And our time was up. The plane was 
waiting for us. So we went back to Vietnam. And I got

09:23.068 --> 09:35.742
back and was returned to full duty, naturally, in 
time for a, I think, right after I got back, I was on a

09:23.068 --> 09:35.742
Sparrowhawk mission in North Vietnam. It was an 
unsuccessful one. We went in to pick up a downed

09:38.124 --> 09:41.188
pilot, but the enemy had already got him. We found 
the crash site of the F4. We destroyed anything of

09:45.693 --> 09:50.299
importance militarily on the craft that we could. 
And we radioed for pickup. We pulled back out of

09:54.844 --> 09:56.146
there again. After that, spent a little bit of time 
around Camelot fortifying it, digging holes,

10:01.237 --> 10:07.386
long bunkers, filling sandbags, laying 
concertina wire. And there was a lot of this kind of

10:07.747 --> 10:10.191
working parties in between time. Any time that we 
weren't actively engaged with the enemy, we were

10:10.732 --> 10:21.168
filling sandbags, digging holes, laying 
concertina, putting out minefields, or

10:10.732 --> 10:21.168
something like that. They always had work for you. 
It never ended. But we'd grown used to that. That

10:26.335 --> 10:27.237
was life. That's what life was then. We had 
Operation Deckhouse 4. I always remember

10:32.742 --> 10:40.089
Deckhouse 4 as a real screw-up operation. They 
formed up the 26th Marines, which is another

10:40.109 --> 10:48.738
regiment, and it was going to become part of the 4th 
Marine Division, which I'm not sure was ever

10:40.109 --> 10:48.738
really truly activated. The 26th Marines was the 
first regiment of the 4th Marine Division to be

10:49.539 --> 10:54.463
activated since World War II. They'd had them 
then. 26 was made up of replacements of cooks,

10:57.852 --> 11:02.937
bakers, Remington Raiders. That's typist. 
Anybody and everybody they could put together to

11:04.678 --> 11:08.041
form a regiment of Marines. Uh, we were to operate 
with the 26th Marines by we, I mean what was left of

11:09.442 --> 11:20.272
the fourth Marines at this time. And we were pretty 
dismal. We didn't look like a regular Marine

11:22.554 --> 11:24.356
regiment. We were few in number. We were dirty. We 
had torn uniforms. We were suntan to the degree.

11:31.995 --> 11:36.427
Every person in my outfit had a 28-inch waist 
because there was no fat on us. We had marched the

11:37.410 --> 11:40.077
length of Vietnam at least twice. We looked more 
like a gang of pirates than we did Marines. But the

11:44.878 --> 11:50.385
26th had fresh uniforms, fresh combat boots, 
fresh helmets. Their helmet covers were newly

11:50.986 --> 11:53.029
camouflaged. They had the latest in equipment. A 
lot of our M14s were so banged around. Some of us at

11:58.216 --> 12:00.198
that time still had M14s. Some had M16s. They were 
phasing them out by then. You mentioned you

12:03.563 --> 12:06.308
despise the M16. I don't like the M16. We call it the 
Mattel toy. They always show it in the pictures you

12:09.273 --> 12:11.578
see at Vietnam. They show that's the only weapon 
that was there was the M16. But the M14 did a lot of

12:14.844 --> 12:19.552
fighting over there, and a lot of the outfits never 
had anything but M14s. I have a Mini. A Mini 14?

12:24.301 --> 12:24.441
Mm-hmm. I like the M14. It was a good solid weapon, 
and it was the last of the American-issue weapons

12:25.956 --> 12:30.681
that had a real solid wooden stock. It had a good 
bayonet. It was heavy enough that if you did get

12:33.484 --> 12:41.633
into hand-to-hand combat, which I was only in one 
time in the whole time, but we did have one time,

12:33.484 --> 12:41.633
that you could fight with something. The M16 fires 
faster. It has a higher muzzle velocity. The

12:47.499 --> 12:51.643
cyclic rate of fire is greater, but it's... It 
tends to jam more. That's my experience. I never

12:56.995 --> 13:00.946
had an M14 jam with me as many times as an M16 would. 
If you went on an operation with an M16, you knew it

13:01.226 --> 13:04.415
was going to jam on you. It was going to jam. It was 
just a matter of when. No matter how much you tried

13:07.874 --> 13:11.241
to keep it clean, and we cleaned them every 
opportunity we get. We cleaned our magazines. We

13:12.403 --> 13:17.754
even cleaned the ammunition individually, round 
by round, to keep every bit of grain of sand off it.

13:18.035 --> 13:21.502
Because a grain of sand caught between the sides of 
the spring in a magazine would jam it. And instead

13:22.023 --> 13:26.472
of your ammo feeding up by the spring pressure, it 
would get caught. And if we would fire around,

13:27.093 --> 13:29.578
there wouldn't be anything there. because the 
other one was stuck down in the magazine. Then

13:32.101 --> 13:36.486
you'd have to field strip a weapon, pull out a 
magazine, pull out the ammunition, pull out the

13:32.101 --> 13:36.486
spring, clean it. And this is a rough thing to do in 
the middle of a battle. People get killed that way.

13:40.430 --> 13:43.193
The M16 got a lot of good men killed. But that's 
another story. I won't get off on that. Anyway,

13:45.736 --> 13:52.343
getting back to this Operation Deckhouse 4, the 26 
Marines were moving forward. in full regimental

13:52.542 --> 13:55.064
strength. We were on their flanks. We were there 
mainly as guides because we were combat veterans

13:56.286 --> 14:01.310
and we knew the terrain. The 26th was supposed to 
bear the brunt of the fighting. We were

14:04.373 --> 14:05.434
understrength. We were sick. We were suffering 
from malaria and dysentery, and we weren't

14:07.296 --> 14:19.387
supposed to do anything more than provide guides 
for them to go in to, again, once again, come up

14:07.296 --> 14:19.387
against the 242nd B Division of the North 
Vietnamese Army. We seemed to always be fighting

14:19.468 --> 14:20.869
them. Wherever we went, they were there. Well, 
they ran into them. The North Vietnamese were

14:26.064 --> 14:27.928
regulars. They were seasoned veterans. They'd 
fought many a Marine by this time. They knew all the

14:31.094 --> 14:32.957
tricks of the trade. They laid down a heavy barrage 
of 120 millimeter Russian rockets on the 26

14:33.979 --> 14:38.227
Marines. And the regiment, who had never been 
tested in battle before, they didn't phase them in

14:39.249 --> 14:44.378
gradually. They just threw them into a major 
battle. They ran. You won't find that in the

14:47.673 --> 14:51.557
history books or you won't see it on TV, but the 26th 
Marines ran. Half of them threw down their rifles

14:51.918 --> 14:53.459
and ran. It was to the rear march with track shoes. 
It wasn't an organized retreat. It was en route.

15:00.547 --> 15:08.635
They threw the 4th Marines in between what was left 
of the 4th Marines, in between the retreat of the

15:00.547 --> 15:08.635
26th Marines and the advance of an enemy division. 
That was the end of the 4th Marine Regiment in

15:09.837 --> 15:13.761
Vietnam for all practical purposes. We stopped 
the advance of an enemy division. We were an

15:16.164 --> 15:17.545
understrength regiment. We were a regiment of 
about 1,500 men. They threw us against 20,000

15:20.718 --> 15:22.421
regulars. 20,000?

15:25.885 --> 15:28.088
North Vietnamese Division, roughly 20,000 men. 
And they wiped you out? They pretty well wiped us

15:31.934 --> 15:33.055
out. E Company, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, three 
days later had 17 men left in the company out of a

15:33.536 --> 15:41.507
line company of 208 officers and men. Someone told 
me that you were in a combat situation where the

15:41.926 --> 15:47.232
only way you survived was having dead bodies piled 
on top of you. Was this the situation? That was the

15:47.733 --> 15:48.754
situation. We were in a little area. As the troops 
were moving, you got to understand the interplay

15:52.198 --> 15:58.245
of large bodies of troops, battalions, 
companies. My company went into an area. We were

16:01.088 --> 16:03.691
trying to, this was a multiple day operation. It 
wasn't something that happened in an afternoon.

16:05.653 --> 16:07.275
It was over a period of several days. The 26th was 
falling back on the coast. We were trying to cover

16:09.764 --> 16:10.765
it. We were falling back, but slower. Trying to lay 
down protective fire, fall back, stop them with

16:13.167 --> 16:21.274
fire, call in artillery, airstrikes, fall back. 
It was kind of a leapfrog type thing. We were

16:23.976 --> 16:28.440
allowing the 26th what was... Actually, they 
didn't take that many casualties. They didn't

16:28.500 --> 16:30.842
stay around to take casualties. As you can tell by 
the tone of my voice, I don't have very much use for

16:31.963 --> 16:35.386
the 26th Marines. But... Anyway, someone decided 
that we needed an enemy prisoner. My company

16:42.843 --> 16:44.766
commander at this time was a new man. He had been 
sent over to us from a motor transport outfit. He

16:47.209 --> 16:48.771
didn't have any infantry experience. He had very 
little combat experience. But he was a captain,

16:50.894 --> 16:52.777
and they needed a captain. And he filled the bill at 
the time. His mission was to capture a prisoner and

16:55.140 --> 16:59.205
get him back to battalion for questioning. And we 
got sucked into an ambush. A North Vietnamese

17:03.251 --> 17:06.996
regular came out, fired at us, and ran back down the 
hill. The captain ordered a platoon, first

17:08.815 --> 17:14.582
platoon of our company, to go send a squad to get 
this man. Everyone advised against it, but he was

17:15.824 --> 17:19.829
the captain and he ordered it. So the squad went. 
The squad was pretty well wiped out in seconds by

17:21.791 --> 17:27.999
grazing fire from surrounding hills. Instead of 
taking his losses and falling back and calling in

17:28.900 --> 17:37.911
heavier weapons, he sent in the rest of the first 
platoon to try to get the survivors of the first

17:28.900 --> 17:37.911
squad out. The first platoon was chewed up in the 
meat grinder. Again, we begged him to fall back,

17:41.676 --> 17:45.580
call in heavy weapons. There's no use killing more 
men, but he sent in the other two platoons of the

17:46.882 --> 17:54.351
rifle company to try to get out the first platoon. 
He was at this point in tears. He got so many men

17:56.073 --> 17:57.234
killed. He couldn't think of anything except he 
had made a blunder, a mistake, and he was trying to

17:57.294 --> 18:03.662
pull it out some way. So the other two platoons, 
second and third platoon, weapons platoon was

18:04.098 --> 18:11.897
attached at this time to the various rifle 
platoons we went into. My own feeling was we were

18:14.203 --> 18:17.892
walking into it. I knew it. I felt it. I really 
wasn't all that scared. I guess I'd accepted that I

18:22.352 --> 18:24.075
was going to die. That was just all there is to it, 
because that was what was going to happen. I'd been

18:27.679 --> 18:29.001
in combat too long. You become a realist after a 
while. The human body doesn't stand up against too

18:31.324 --> 18:35.169
much flying metal. And we got hit, naturally. We 
expected it. We did. The heavy weapons that had

18:38.934 --> 18:42.659
chewed up the rest of our company got us, too. The 
captain was hit. People were yelling for Corman.

18:46.328 --> 18:47.369
They were shooting everywhere. There was smoke. 
There was dirt. People were falling. People were

18:50.072 --> 18:50.973
screaming. Somebody, I don't remember who right 
now, he wasn't in my platoon, fell on me. He was a

18:58.721 --> 18:59.362
heavy guy. I think his name was Edwards.

19:05.028 --> 19:06.069
Fell as in dead? Yeah, fell as in dead. He fell on me, 
and blood was all over me. I had just emptied my

19:09.172 --> 19:12.615
magazine. I had an empty magazine. And I was in the 
process of changing magazines, switching. We had

19:18.743 --> 19:21.807
magazines taped to magazines for quick change. 
And I was trying to switch it around when he fell on

19:22.668 --> 19:24.811
me. I fell down the grass. He was on top of me. And 
about that time, the shooting stopped. There was a

19:29.917 --> 19:31.900
couple of pops, a few more pops. And then there was 
nothing. It was just quiet. You could smell the

19:36.766 --> 19:38.488
carbide and the smoke. And as always, the flies was 
already buzzing around. I just laid there

19:44.234 --> 19:47.738
thinking I was the only one left alive because 
there was no resistance. The company had been...

19:50.662 --> 19:51.263
I'm sorry. We had been ambushed, effectively 
ambushed. The fire had discontinued. Yeah, the

19:55.708 --> 19:57.390
fire had discontinued. It was quiet. And I was 
covered in blood, not my own. And the enemy

20:01.775 --> 20:07.482
soldiers, North Vietnamese regulars, were 
walking around. I could see their feet. I didn't

20:09.785 --> 20:11.027
dare raise my head. I didn't even move. I tried to 
suppress my breathing. They were taking rings and

20:16.669 --> 20:20.615
watches off of my friends and my buddies. They were 
laughing. They'd wiped out a Marine company. I

20:27.585 --> 20:28.727
felt pretty good about it, I guess. As it turned 
out, there were more of us than just myself. Half a

20:37.661 --> 20:43.249
squad had managed to pull back up the hill before 
they got sucked in the valley, and they were up

20:37.661 --> 20:43.249
there There were a few others that were wounded 
that managed to fake that they were dead. There

20:51.416 --> 20:54.759
were some that were wounded that were killed 
during this period of time. I heard they shot them

20:54.779 --> 20:58.363
or they bayoneted them. More often than not, they 
bayoneted them, no use wasting a bullet.

21:05.792 --> 21:06.673
It was a long night. I sat there. As luck would have 
it, I fell into an ant bed. But I didn't move. The

21:12.833 --> 21:15.118
ants were crawling all over me and biting the hell 
out of me.

21:18.383 --> 21:20.187
And I guess I had all kinds of thoughts that night. I 
even considered suicide rather than become a

21:20.227 --> 21:23.853
North Vietnamese prisoner. They didn't treat 
Marines too good, at least that's what we had

21:24.534 --> 21:26.799
heard. But I was afraid to move. I was cramped, too. 
I had a cramp in my leg. It

21:36.318 --> 22:05.346
sounds

21:36.318 --> 22:05.346
kind of looking back on it now 20 something years 
ago It sounds Probably for civilized society,

22:06.338 --> 22:09.020
pretty gross, I guess. But

22:09.861 --> 22:14.826
that's the way it was. I was a sergeant. I was a 
platoon sergeant. I was scared. I felt alone. I was

22:23.634 --> 22:27.057
hurting. I was cramping. But I didn't dare move. I 
didn't dare massage the cramp, which you feel

22:29.620 --> 22:33.223
instinctively you've got to do. I could hear the 
enemy. They were not that far away. I could hear

22:37.197 --> 22:37.959
them talking. In Vietnamese, I guess my fear was 
greater than my suffering. At that point, at least

22:43.769 --> 22:46.193
it controlled everything else. It's the kind of 
situation, and what I mean by gross is you don't

22:46.814 --> 22:51.883
even move when you go to the bathroom. You just go. 
It's pretty gross, I admit that. War is gross, and

22:57.702 --> 23:01.746
that was about the grossest part I'd been involved 
in up to that point. You hadn't received any actual

23:02.427 --> 23:04.088
war? I wasn't sure, to tell you the truth, at that 
point. I wasn't sure that I wasn't wounded. I was

23:08.392 --> 23:09.493
hurt. I was cramped. I was in an awkward position. I 
was covered in blood, and I had, when you're

23:12.916 --> 23:17.080
scared, your adrenaline flows. I can look back on 
it educated now. And your adrenaline conceals a

23:20.483 --> 23:23.646
multitude of sins. You don't know whether you're 
wounded, and I'd been wounded before and not known

23:24.588 --> 23:27.211
it. I wasn't sure. I didn't think I was. But I wasn't 
honestly sure one way or the other. We were tired

23:36.183 --> 23:39.407
anyway, which was so... I guess I slept off a known 
part of the night. Catnapped, more than anything.

23:44.894 --> 23:46.557
Every time a twig broke, I'd wake up. I heard some 
whispering. But I wasn't sure. I thought it was

23:51.683 --> 23:53.025
American... But I wasn't sure, and I was afraid. 
And there was somebody calling for water. I kept

23:58.278 --> 23:59.765
hearing somebody call for water. I was sure of 
that. In my mind, I was sure of it, but I was afraid it

24:01.780 --> 24:08.488
might be a trick, too, to see if there was anybody 
else that they could get. We were in elephant

24:09.189 --> 24:10.451
grass. Elephant grass is like, the closest thing 
in Texas to it is Johnson grass. It grows taller,

24:15.537 --> 24:20.383
though, and it's thicker bladed, and it cuts you 
the same as Johnson grass. And we'd fallen down in

24:20.783 --> 24:22.545
this stuff. That was what the bottom of this valley 
was, filled with it. So there was a goodly number of

24:25.709 --> 24:29.774
us that were sort of concealed by the grass. Even 
though we were close, you couldn't see. I couldn't

24:34.861 --> 24:35.742
see anyway. It was dark. I could hear things. And of 
course the mosquitoes were having a field day on

24:38.907 --> 24:41.870
us, all of us. I was afraid of tigers. I kept 
thinking about tigers because tigers were in that

24:45.816 --> 24:49.661
area and they liked to feed on dead bodies. For some 
reason, that was my greatest fear, was a big tiger

24:51.003 --> 24:55.108
coming down and grabbing me. uh i kept visualizing 
it every time i heard a sound i would think that the

24:55.696 --> 25:15.426
tiger was tiger was coming we had seen them before 
tigers actually stuck around well they love to

24:55.696 --> 25:15.426
feed them yeah they love to feed on the on the bodies 
after a battle happened a number of times um of

24:55.696 --> 25:15.426
course No tigers showed up, obviously. I guess 
there was too much activity around, human

25:20.406 --> 25:22.693
activity. They usually go to a battlefield where 
there was bodies and there was nobody around. We'd

25:26.044 --> 25:28.993
find their evidence later many times. The next 
day, the battle picked up again early in the

25:30.543 --> 25:34.531
morning before daylight. A lot of artillery fire. 
I didn't know whose it was. Some planes passed

25:38.458 --> 25:39.961
overhead. There was some rocket fire, heavy 
weapons fire, light weapons fire. I didn't know

25:46.834 --> 25:49.539
who was firing at whom. I just continued to lie 
there. Around noon, maybe a little later, I'm not

25:51.721 --> 26:00.330
sure, the weapons fire picked up pretty heavy, and 
it was around the edge of the valley, I could tell,

25:51.721 --> 26:00.330
coming down from the hills. Sometime that 
afternoon, Fox Company, sister company of ours in

26:01.151 --> 26:13.303
the same battalion, came in, and they took a few 
casualties, quite a few, I think, and they started

26:01.151 --> 26:13.303
pulling bodies out. And when I realized that our 
people was there, of course, I called. And I was so

26:17.101 --> 26:22.748
cramped I couldn't walk because I'd stayed in a 
cramped position all night long, not moving. And I

26:23.109 --> 26:25.351
thought I was wounded at the time. It turned out 
that I wasn't. All told, there was 17 men that came

26:27.634 --> 26:36.586
out of the company, including a portion of the 
squad that had got away up on the hill. And that was

26:36.606 --> 26:39.850
the biggest portion of the men that was left alive 
out of E Company. All of us were evacuated. The

26:43.074 --> 26:46.298
battalion commander ordered every single man in E 
Company evacuated. There were several put up for

26:47.408 --> 26:49.731
medals after that. It was put up for a bronze star. 
It never came through. There was no witness, which

26:54.637 --> 27:00.305
any kind of a citation has to be accompanied by a 
witness. There was no living witness anyway.

27:06.453 --> 27:10.859
After that, our battalion was sent to Okinawa. 
That was several weeks later, two or three weeks.

27:13.722 --> 27:15.745
We went back to Fubai. They let us rest up for a 
while, and then they decided that we were no longer

27:16.636 --> 27:22.747
combat effective. We were too weak materially. We 
lost a lot of weapons. We lost a lot of men. Rather

27:28.197 --> 27:31.222
than send the replacements to us, they sent them to 
other outfits. They sent us back to Okinawa for

27:31.824 --> 27:34.809
reorganization and re-equipping. That was my 
last major operation in Vietnam. Well, that was

27:39.282 --> 27:43.307
Deck House 4, that particular operation, the end 
of Deck House 4. Hastings came, but Hastings and

27:43.347 --> 27:46.250
Deck House 4 ran into each other. Where one ended, 
the other began. We pulled, and our initial

27:48.673 --> 27:56.423
contact with the North Vietnamese on Hastings 
became like a stalemate. We had fought each other

27:56.443 --> 28:06.775
down to a standstill, and that's when they threw 
the 26 Marines in to try to post-corrupt the

27:56.443 --> 28:06.775
attack, and that's when the 26 Marines was routed, 
and we were thrown in to protect them. And then we

28:07.025 --> 28:08.527
were chewed up. In the process, however, we did 
manage, the battalion that I was in managed to

28:08.907 --> 28:17.037
inflict very heavy casualties on the enemy. They 
didn't get everything for nothing either. And

28:19.439 --> 28:22.723
they pulled back into North Vietnam. It blunted 
their attack totally. And that was our goal. So I

28:26.708 --> 28:30.332
guess to that degree, we were successful. Later 
after that, there were, of course, a lot more

28:30.599 --> 28:34.223
operations. I was sent back to Okinawa, then sent 
on back to the States, and then I got my separation

28:34.283 --> 28:43.712
from active duty. I'd spent all total 22 months in 
Vietnam, two tours of duty. I had a total of 13 major

28:49.057 --> 28:51.800
combat operations. I don't know how many patrols 
or minor skirmishes. Our battalion captured,

28:56.565 --> 28:59.728
killed, I think the numbers was reported 
something in the neighborhood of 4,000 enemy

29:00.704 --> 29:08.253
troops from our battalion. We all together as a 
battalion, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines at that

29:09.775 --> 29:19.487
time had the highest casualty rate of any American 
combat command. But we had also the highest

29:21.230 --> 29:27.297
prisoner rate and the highest kill rate of any 
American combat command. We saw more action from

29:27.317 --> 29:30.441
the beginning until the time that they pulled us 
out than any other combat command. So forces

29:34.998 --> 29:37.762
eliminated Vietnam and the 4th Marines? No, they 
regrouped. They reorganized it. They sent it back

29:40.466 --> 29:44.091
in with new men, new equipment, new material. The 
4th Marines is still active today. The 4th

29:47.356 --> 29:54.026
Marines, during World War II, the 4th Marines was 
again made up of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions.

29:54.066 --> 29:56.850
The 1st and 3rd Battalions was surrendered 
immediately at Corregidor by General

29:57.590 --> 29:59.532
Wainwright. The 2nd Battalion at that time was not 
on the Philippines. They were on detached duty to

30:02.676 --> 30:06.060
some other part of the Pacific. They were not 
surrendered at Corregidor. They were detached.

30:10.966 --> 30:13.289
They had no regiment to belong to. The regimental 
colors of the 4th Marine Regiment was nonexistent

30:13.469 --> 30:19.596
until Operation Starlight. We won our regimental 
colors back on Operation Starlight. We were

30:22.640 --> 30:24.762
awarded colors again for the first time. All of 
those years in between Corregidor and Operation

30:25.062 --> 30:32.212
Starlight, the 4th Marine Regiment had no 
regimental colors because they'd been

30:25.062 --> 30:32.212
surrendered to the Japanese. The only American 
combat command that could surrender colors, the

30:32.573 --> 30:43.909
rest were remnants of command at Corregidor, was 
the two battalions of the 4th Marine Regiment,

30:32.573 --> 30:43.909
which was under an army general. The 2nd 
Battalion, 4th Marines during World War II,

30:43.929 --> 30:52.461
became what was known as a Raider Battalion. They 
were the ones that took Macon Island. during the

30:55.268 --> 30:56.350
Pacific. The 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines were 
designated as Marine Raiders. They still told

31:00.175 --> 31:10.110
that, or at least when I was in that title to the 
date, they were the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion

31:00.175 --> 31:10.110
assigned to the 4th Marine Regiment. So you have a 
big history with the 4th Marines. The 4th Marines

31:14.576 --> 31:17.040
used to be known as the China Marines. If you ever 
heard of the Boxer Rebellion, the Marines that was

31:17.307 --> 31:27.999
stationed in Peking, that was a unit of the Fourth 
Marines, the China Marines. I saw the movie. That

31:29.501 --> 31:32.123
was the units of the Fourth Marines. When you got 
back to America, what were your reactions? I mean,

31:38.210 --> 31:40.092
people, how they treated you. I didn't like it. I 
was sent to Okinawa first. In Okinawa, we were

31:44.763 --> 31:51.791
given a thorough physical examination to make 
sure we weren't carrying any unwanted bugs back to

31:44.763 --> 31:51.791
the States. We were given new uniforms. Are you 
going to want to pay for that, or would you like to

31:57.418 --> 32:00.301
keep it on the tab? I'll pay for it. Okay, sure. They 
didn't do very much in the way of what you would call

32:03.825 --> 32:09.792
orientation training or anything like that. I was 
at that point in time, as were the other people with

32:10.598 --> 32:18.585
me, we were nothing but combat Marines. That's all 
I was. That's all I had learned. My life before then

32:21.027 --> 32:24.550
had been totally subverted. When I looked at a 
tree, I saw a possible place for a sniper. When I

32:29.955 --> 32:34.259
looked at a bush, if it was big enough to conceal a 
man, I saw a possible place for a sniper. When I saw a

32:36.000 --> 32:40.504
door after the fighting, the in-house fighting in 
the way, Remember, we learned then to go in by

32:41.075 --> 32:46.082
tossing grenades before you walked in a building. 
Because if the North Vietnamese proved to be quite

32:46.463 --> 32:54.235
capable and willing to shoot, and even knowing 
they would be killed, they would take somebody

32:46.463 --> 32:54.235
with them. So we cleared a room by grenade. But 
you've learned these things. What I'm trying to

32:57.119 --> 33:01.545
say is, when I came back to the so-called 
civilization, it was quite a shock for me. And as

33:02.046 --> 33:04.590
I'm sure as it was for everybody else, it was very 
difficult. The government didn't provide any

33:05.672 --> 33:09.377
kind of... uh phase out uh returning you to 
civilization we went from okinawa i was put on a

33:09.813 --> 33:34.470
troop ship a usns ship it sent to uh yokohama japan 
where we changed ship went on another type of a ship

33:09.813 --> 33:34.470
it was a government ship but it was a larger one to 
san francisco and it was 27 days across the

33:34.822 --> 33:38.406
Pacific, I believe, into San Francisco. We came 
under the Golden Gate. Golden Gate looked

33:40.228 --> 33:41.189
beautiful. Hadn't been home in a long time. There 
were on that ship hundreds and hundreds and

33:43.191 --> 33:52.101
hundreds of armed forces personnel, Army, Air 
Force, Marine, Naval.

33:55.265 --> 33:56.506
Most had been from Vietnam. They had given us fresh 
uniforms, but we were still very tan. We were still

34:00.311 --> 34:01.412
very skinny. We were still very much... We hadn't 
been out of Vietnam that long. We were still very

34:06.273 --> 34:08.756
much combat people, all of us. We were stopped in 
the San Francisco Bay. On one side was Oakland. On

34:15.142 --> 34:16.484
the other side was San Francisco. We could see the 
lights of both cities in the evening, but the ship

34:16.544 --> 34:22.409
was at anchor, and we didn't know why. It stayed at 
anchor out there for three days. Then they took us

34:24.872 --> 34:28.716
to the Army docks, I believe it was, for 
debarkation. We went off, and then they trucked us

34:31.387 --> 34:59.554
all the way around and we came back in through the 
gates onto treasure island where once again we

34:31.387 --> 34:59.554
were given medical examinations but on getting 
into treasure island there was some kind of a

34:31.387 --> 34:59.554
protest although they the government and the san 
francisco police didn't allow the protesters to

34:31.387 --> 34:59.554
get real close we could see them at a distance it was 
looked to be like young people uh young men and

34:31.387 --> 34:59.554
women that were yelling and and uh shouting and 
there was a lot of them we went into the the Treasure

35:00.665 --> 35:04.109
Island Naval Depot there. And they kept us there 
for a period of time. They brought our shot records

35:10.035 --> 35:13.579
up to date, which most of us were inspired. Why, I 
don't know, but they did. They checked us over

35:16.963 --> 35:18.004
again. It was our third physical, I think, 
something like that, making sure we weren't

35:18.024 --> 35:24.211
carrying any bugs again. And then they let us go.

35:30.010 --> 35:43.288
They

35:30.010 --> 35:43.288
let us go home in groups. They wouldn't let a whole 
group of us go out together. We had to have

35:48.194 --> 35:51.158
transportation to either the airport or the bus 
station or wherever we were going by what means.

35:55.960 --> 35:57.882
And we were not allowed a lot of liberty in San 
Francisco. None of us could go into San Francisco.

35:59.444 --> 36:03.429
The city of San Francisco requested that we not 
have any liberty. So we were let out in groups of

36:04.811 --> 36:08.916
seven or eight. I went by plane to Los Angeles 
International. My parents picked me up there and I

36:12.521 --> 36:18.208
was given

36:19.505 --> 36:26.675
I want to say 20 days leave, and then I had to report 
to El Toro, and it was only for a period of waiting

36:19.505 --> 36:26.675
around for discharge, that's all. But I had to stay 
in the government and make roll call each morning

36:26.975 --> 36:34.606
and didn't do nothing there but drank beer and make 
formations to say that I was still there. That gave

36:34.646 --> 36:37.270
me another physical. Checked my teeth, which was 
terrible. I think I had something like nine

36:41.316 --> 36:43.459
fillings I had to get. Yeah. When you don't brush 
your teeth for a long time, that sort of thing sort

36:47.872 --> 36:50.616
of happens. We didn't have toothbrushes in 
Vietnam. So it's really just like living like an

36:54.162 --> 36:58.188
animal. Well, I guess by certainly by the 
standards that we are accustomed to right now or

36:58.208 --> 37:05.379
before it was. Do you think now after you came back 
and you learned all the crap that happened over

37:05.419 --> 37:13.672
there, do you think we could have won that war? We 
could have won that war on any Friday. Anytime we

37:16.036 --> 37:19.962
wanted to, we could have won the war. 1966, I 
believe it was, we had 700,000 men in Vietnam,

37:19.982 --> 37:23.807
American forces. There was, if they had allowed us 
to cross the North Vietnamese border in force, a

37:24.708 --> 37:35.884
combined land-sea attack, amphibious 
operation, combined with probably a... airborne

37:36.809 --> 37:42.615
operation and then a massive attack across the 
border, we could have taken North Vietnam. But do

37:42.635 --> 37:44.357
you think the Chinese might? That was the fear. At 
least that's what we heard was the fear that if we

37:45.538 --> 37:50.924
had attacked North Vietnam, the Chinese would 
have become involved. I can't answer that. I don't

37:52.986 --> 37:53.427
know. It would just be a speculation. My guess 
would be as good as somebody else's. But I know we

37:59.073 --> 38:00.634
could have taken North Vietnam. I have no doubt 
about that. we were not allowed to cross borders

38:03.505 --> 38:10.495
overtly. We had to do it covertly. When we went into 
what they called incursions into Laos or Cambodia

38:12.398 --> 38:20.910
or North Vietnam, it was done as a covert 
operation. And that is to say we...

38:21.832 --> 38:29.563
Sparrowhawk-type operations, missions, to pick 
up downed pilots, or in some cases they were

38:21.832 --> 38:29.563
reconnaissance missions. In some cases, we went 
in for reconnaissance purposes, not necessarily

38:30.050 --> 38:40.243
to do anything except, in some cases, we went in 
with a, you have two types of patrols. You have a

38:40.263 --> 38:42.906
combat patrol or a recon patrol. And some of those 
patrols were combat, to go in to destroy a bridge,

38:42.926 --> 38:49.214
to go in to blow up a SAM site. Those were rare, 
really rare. Only if they couldn't get it some

38:52.719 --> 38:57.525
other way, usually an airstrike could take them 
out.

38:59.733 --> 39:07.685
I

38:59.733 --> 39:07.685
don't know if that answers your question, sir. We 
talked about this earlier when I put the tape on

39:07.725 --> 39:18.100
pause, but could you give your impression of the 
argument of the South Vietnamese people as a whole

39:07.725 --> 39:18.100
towards America?

39:20.724 --> 39:28.255
The South Vietnamese people as a whole, I think, 
looking back on it, were just kind of tired. That's

39:28.927 --> 39:29.789
how they looked. They looked like they were tired. 
They were tired of war. They were tired probably of

39:34.600 --> 39:40.292
governments that were not functioning the way 
they should. I don't think they trusted us. I think

39:43.945 --> 39:54.918
that some few individuals that we met from time to 
time and helped from time to time may have thought

39:43.945 --> 39:54.918
that some few of us were okay people. I know that we 
had contact with some South Vietnamese and it was a

39:54.938 --> 40:01.886
good contact, but these were individuals meeting 
individuals. I could equally say that I know on

40:03.208 --> 40:08.434
some occasions where we had contact and it was a 
negative contact because We burned the village

40:08.735 --> 40:09.817
down. We destroyed the rice fields. We went in and 
took the rice that was stored in storage between

40:12.200 --> 40:18.869
seasons. It was considered, if we found rice, as a 
possible stock for the enemy. So we destroyed it.

40:25.679 --> 40:28.903
The most simple way was to throw it into a river. It 
would swell, become no good.

40:34.486 --> 40:39.391
I know that in those cases that the enemy, by their 
looks, hated us. I remember one morning on one

40:39.752 --> 40:43.095
operation, it was a search and destroy. Search and 
destroy missions didn't usually have names like

40:43.876 --> 40:46.839
the big operations. It was just a search and 
destroy. They'd get you all up, form up a couple of

40:48.181 --> 40:52.926
companies, and they'd march you to a village, and 
you'd go through in line. You'd round up all the

40:53.366 --> 41:04.358
people, bring them into the central village 
square or the center of the village, as the case may

40:53.366 --> 41:04.358
be, and then we would either arrange transport to 
haul them out to relocation centers or move them by

41:05.367 --> 41:11.373
foot to some place where they could get vehicles to 
take them to relocation centers. The Vietnamese

41:12.334 --> 41:14.316
were very much afraid of helicopters. They didn't 
want to go on board them at all. Even when they were

41:16.238 --> 41:17.880
wounded, they were afraid of them. They didn't 
even particularly like getting on trucks. When

41:22.244 --> 41:26.088
they would finally be forced on trucks, I think 
many of them thought they were being taken to their

41:22.244 --> 41:26.088
death. Our relocation centers that we set up were 
designed to clear areas for combat operations so

41:31.439 --> 41:43.913
that there would not be villagers in the way, so 
that we could lay down artillery fire, we could

41:31.439 --> 41:43.913
call in airstrikes without having civilians in 
the way, so to speak. Of course, it's awfully hard

41:44.146 --> 41:55.419
to tell a person who's lived in a village for all 
their life and their parents lived there and their

41:44.146 --> 41:55.419
grandparents before them, and you could probably 
go back a few thousand years in some cases, that

41:44.146 --> 41:55.419
this is done for their benefit. You can imagine the 
average American, if they're suddenly uprooted

41:56.080 --> 42:07.574
by foreign soldiers to come in at the point of 
bayonets, get you out of your bed and say you're

41:56.080 --> 42:07.574
being relocated for your own convenience, for 
your protection. Most of our people would be

42:07.674 --> 42:11.959
somewhat upset.

42:12.901 --> 42:16.767
Although, by comparison to our homes, their homes 
were back shots.

42:21.474 --> 42:23.758
It was still their homes. Very tight land. Yes, 
they were. They were a people, the South

42:29.927 --> 42:33.913
Vietnamese, that... We're tired of war. They've 
known war all their life, nothing but war. I don't

42:38.897 --> 42:40.418
think that they welcomed us. I don't think they 
particularly hated us, all of them. Some of them

42:43.601 --> 42:44.241
did. Some of them didn't. Some of them, some 
Vietnamese girls married American GIs. There

42:49.906 --> 42:59.975
was, I wouldn't even venture as a guess to what 
percentage that was, probably very low, but it was

42:49.906 --> 42:59.975
like people anywheres. They were a people caught 
up in a giant,

43:07.306 --> 43:07.967
It was a mess. It was an interaction, a power 
struggle between different ideologies. And they

43:14.295 --> 43:15.817
were the people that was caught in the middle. I 
cannot fault them because of their lack of

43:16.779 --> 43:22.546
dedication to the war effort. Looking at it, at the 
time being, I did. I have to be honest. At the time

43:26.852 --> 43:29.055
being, I thought they were a gutless bunch of 
creeps. We came over there to help them. And then in

43:30.557 --> 43:32.740
the middle of the battle, they turned off and run. 
But looking back on it in retrospect, It's awful

43:36.483 --> 43:42.933
hard, taking it from their point of view, to really 
hit them too hard, to criticize them too much.

43:45.958 --> 43:46.639
We pulled out. We left. Most of those people stayed 
behind, and they had to face their conquerors

43:47.781 --> 43:50.625
then. And I'm sure many of them, the ones that were 
the most loyal to us, the ones that were the most

43:51.807 --> 43:57.035
friendly to us, I'm sure they suffered. I'm sure 
their neighbors told on them.

44:05.052 --> 44:07.741
Went down the wrong way. That's

44:07.761 --> 44:15.426
rough.

44:16.470 --> 44:18.336
The Arvin, as a military force, Yeah, second rate 
at best. And that's a given. That's being nice. As

44:28.240 --> 44:40.574
long as we bolstered up their planks and bolstered 
up them, held them up, they could form the pretense

44:28.240 --> 44:40.574
of an effective fighting force. The moment that we 
weren't there, Defense crumbled so I could not

44:43.139 --> 44:57.734
honestly say the Arvin was anything to be 
respected as a military unit if that answers your

44:43.139 --> 44:57.734
question, I You were They had other things over 
there is equivalent to our National Guard. They

44:57.754 --> 45:10.648
have what they call PS popular forces They were 
usually barefoot They carried no pack no helmet

44:57.754 --> 45:10.648
dressed in the typical village dress they would 
have a rifle a pouch and Some ammunition. Any

45:14.113 --> 45:16.195
number of things. All kinds of weapons. Communist 
weapons, American weapons, French weapons,

45:18.418 --> 45:22.522
anything and everything they could get. P.S. 
generally, we employed them in the beginning as

45:24.624 --> 45:29.049
scouts, as interpreters. Some of them spoke 
English or broken English. The most difficult

45:33.054 --> 45:36.738
thing we always had was interpretation, trying to 
talk to the people. Americans are not bilingual.

45:39.265 --> 46:04.885
even our officers are not and we're not then either

45:39.265 --> 46:04.885
i think we're okay thank you

45:39.265 --> 46:04.885
there was a goodly number of vietnamese who spoke 
french more so than spoke english in fact so most

45:39.265 --> 46:04.885
translations from vietnamese to french to 
english a lot of it occurred that way There was some

46:05.725 --> 46:15.489
who spoke English, or at least a bit of English, and 
we would communicate by sign language and by

46:05.725 --> 46:15.489
drawings and pictures and everything else. They 
tried to assign to most companies an interpreter.

46:20.882 --> 46:21.945
The interpreters We're pretty shaky. They might 
be here today, it might be gone tomorrow, and you

46:25.013 --> 46:31.786
had to watch your C-rations and your watch and any 
personal effects you might have if they were

46:25.013 --> 46:31.786
around. They would steal just as soon as not. Do you 
think some of them were calm? Oh, yeah. Some of them

46:37.337 --> 46:38.880
were, there's no doubt about it. Some were working 
for both sides, were opportunist.

46:44.051 --> 46:45.233
I think that the... We adopted a very casual, our 
officers are the people that was in command. When

46:53.797 --> 47:05.408
we set up areas such as major defense areas like Da 
Nang, Dong Ho, Phu Bai, a lot of these places, they

46:53.797 --> 47:05.408
would allow the Vietnamese to come in and set up a 
trading market with the Americans. They would

47:06.909 --> 47:15.237
sell things that we couldn't get through our 
normal supply system, mirrors for shaving,

47:06.909 --> 47:15.237
little pans to put water in instead of your hands.
