WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:06.786
Because then, you know, you should mention 
Francisco Villa. Yes. That man had a lot of people.

00:11.190 --> 00:14.053
That man was very cunning. Do you know what is 
cunning? Yes. He had a lot of luck. A lot. He never

00:20.338 --> 00:21.299
fished. And he, with a gun, where he put a shot, he 
put the six shots of the gun. He was very good at

00:29.327 --> 00:30.628
shooting. He didn't sleep with the soldiers 
there. He was the only one who knew where he was. And

00:37.399 --> 00:46.630
he took out his ideas and he sent the others who were 
with him, the generals and everything. Well, he

00:46.690 --> 00:49.834
had many federal soldiers in Torreón. Yes. They 
were raised there. Well, it's a very big town, that

00:51.937 --> 00:54.700
place. Yes. And you and your family were there in 
Torreón during these days or not? And the Federals

01:00.933 --> 01:05.838
were in Piedras Negras, they wanted to throw us out 
of there. And your family was in Piedras Negras?

01:08.521 --> 01:08.702
Yes. And when they found out that Francisco Villa 
took Torreón, from where we were there was a

01:08.722 --> 01:20.274
mountain like 100

01:08.722 --> 01:20.274
miles away, I think. They ran to the mountain and 
saw that we were in Piedras Negras. They asked if

01:25.220 --> 01:27.362
they could take us out of here, and they took us out. 
And they left it there, and then all the people went

01:28.962 --> 01:33.168
back to the same place in Tabonas. But there, 
everything... I lived there for seven years. And

01:37.714 --> 01:40.878
that's what we worked on there. In agriculture. 
And they planted a lot of corn, everything. They

01:48.249 --> 01:51.914
bought all the corn, they sold it in Piedras 
Negras. And they named it there... One ton, which

01:54.781 --> 01:59.608
is called in Mexico, is 2,000 pounds. Well, I sold 
it for 250. 250. I sold it for a ton. And I left a lot of

02:10.384 --> 02:22.982
corn for the household expenses, to feed the pigs, 
to keep them from killing the pigs, and chickens,

02:10.384 --> 02:22.982
and cows. You were living there. You had other 
things that you couldn't have there. You'd go to

02:28.066 --> 02:32.852
the black market, you'd take corn and sell it there 
and buy whatever you wanted. And you'd go back and

02:32.872 --> 02:34.473
forth. And that's how you were living there. But 
when the revolution came and left everything, it

02:36.836 --> 02:42.502
was very hard. It was very hard. And there was, 
well, here it's more than the truth. Sometimes

02:47.819 --> 02:52.225
they didn't have anything to grab or eat. And your 
family too? Yes, because if there was nothing to

02:55.290 --> 02:59.055
grab, there was no work to do. We would go to La Pasta 
to cut firewood and take firewood to sell to

02:59.356 --> 03:11.093
Piedras Negras to get what we needed. And then I 
thought I would come here. Me and other boys came

03:13.563 --> 03:15.846
here. And there we were planting onions in Big 
Wells. And there I came to Beauty. There was my

03:23.153 --> 03:27.217
wife's father. There he was. And there we were. And 
there I was sowing in those years there. And then

03:33.103 --> 03:35.906
from there I came here to Grand. And here I was. All 
of these are... Two of them are from Mexico. He's

03:42.815 --> 03:48.481
the eldest in the family, one of the women and one of 
the men. That little man was a year and a half old. Do

03:50.804 --> 03:52.766
you know what a year and a half is? A year and a half, a 
year and a half. That's a year and six months. Yes,

03:57.091 --> 03:58.012
yes. Well, and he, now that he's grown up, tells us 
here, to us, that sometimes he asks some American

03:58.032 --> 04:07.102
men, well, where are you from? Well, I'm from 
Mexico. Well, how are you? He says, I went through

04:12.329 --> 04:15.253
the chest. Are you wet? No, I'm not wet. Wet means he 
went through the water. Yes. And he tells them that

04:20.619 --> 04:24.203
he went through the chest. And they think he went 
swimming. He went through the river. No. But he

04:28.649 --> 04:31.232
makes them say that he went through Chiquilla. 
Yes. Because my wife was in the gas because she was a

04:32.774 --> 04:38.881
year and a half, but she was small. Yes. That one who 
is here. Yes. He was in the Second World War. He was

04:43.410 --> 04:44.171
in Alaska. And where does he live now? Where does he 
live now? Where does he live? He lives in that

04:51.765 --> 04:54.189
apartment over there. Ah, here in Bryan. His name 
is Herman. And there's another son of him who's a

04:57.274 --> 05:01.742
junior. He was in Alaska, and another one was in 
Houston. His name was Hermenegildo, but in the

05:08.923 --> 05:16.010
army they called him Herman. What kind of work does 
Herman have? Right now? Yes. He puts these fences

05:24.159 --> 05:27.042
in the yards. And his other one? I think about 20 
years, I think. He was working in the dining room of

05:38.554 --> 05:43.259
the East, Duncan Hall. Yes. And he was the 
assistant of, who knows, I would say, Treviño.

05:52.028 --> 05:52.228
Yes. Leonardo Treviño. That was the one who put him 
there. Yes. And this German was his assistant. And

06:03.181 --> 06:05.784
as he says, it's a lot of responsibility. And since 
he was in charge of the working women, and many boys

06:05.804 --> 06:13.092
don't want to work, they're very hard-headed, and 
they fight a lot. There are times when they fight

06:13.112 --> 06:23.363
with each other, and he had to make sure that they 
didn't do that. That they did the work well and

06:23.383 --> 06:29.690
everything, because at that time, not now, as they 
say, as the dining room is now. There is no cleaning

06:29.730 --> 06:31.112
like before. Right now, only women work there. 
Only women. Right now, in this time, people of

06:37.974 --> 06:45.885
color don't

06:37.974 --> 06:45.885
want to work. I was working here last

06:45.905 --> 06:51.814
year. Last year was the beginning of the year. In a 
yard of trails that are here and there. Have you

07:00.848 --> 07:02.530
seen it? I think so. The road that goes here to Casey 
Hall. Yes. I was working with this man here at the

07:06.034 --> 07:09.138
store. He gave me a job there. And one day he told me, 
you know, I'm going to bring a boy of color who has

07:11.341 --> 07:21.973
worked with me a hundred times. I said to him, the 
people of Colorado want to work. He

07:27.890 --> 07:34.760
said, no, he's a very hard worker. But he took him. 
After noon. He took him. When the man was there, he

07:39.607 --> 07:41.770
was working. It was only he who came and went to 
sleep in a room where he was working. When he came

07:50.607 --> 07:52.931
back he made him sleep. He told me that the boy was 
working and I told him that he was sleeping there.

07:57.540 --> 08:01.267
He is very hardworking. He doesn't want to work. 
Here is a relative of my wife who works and left the

08:03.130 --> 08:10.624
job because of the age. He worked in the bakery, in 
the dining room, there in the drawer. And he said,

08:16.365 --> 08:24.733
they put a lady of color there to help me with what 
was there, and two others to help my brother. And

08:24.753 --> 08:27.075
then he said to one, look at this. I said, I don't see 
anything. Well, then why don't you come here to

08:28.997 --> 08:32.961
work? He said, I don't see anything. And he didn't 
work. And he said, what did he say to the mayor

08:37.605 --> 08:41.269
there? until the mayor told him that if he didn't 
want to work, he had better quit. Because this

08:47.633 --> 08:53.839
relative of my wife told him, well, you pay a person 
for not being able to sit down. You are paying him.

08:56.101 --> 08:59.443
He said, well, he has to work. Well, he doesn't want 
to work. It's a very hard job for me because he

09:00.785 --> 09:07.010
doesn't help me with anything. And they don't want 
to work. Both men and women. Well, why? And they

09:11.168 --> 09:15.233
can't get rid of them? What is it that they can't

09:15.474 --> 09:21.822
get rid of or make them work? I don't know. Well, 
there it is. That's something that you should see.

09:26.348 --> 09:29.312
And wherever you go, they talk about it. That they 
don't want to work with them. I don't know why. Like

09:35.200 --> 09:40.888
there, as I told the man when I was working there, I 
told him, hey, it's these men who walk around in

09:35.200 --> 09:40.888
trunks. Are they working with you? Or who were they 
working with? They were sitting all day. All day.

09:50.691 --> 09:54.775
They weren't working at all. No? No. And they were 
stopping him. I told this man, I told him, if you

09:58.399 --> 10:02.724
want to find a job, you don't have to work and you 
have to pay me. He said, because you have to work,

10:04.225 --> 10:06.808
well, and because you don't work. And that's what I 
heard today, that they can't exploit them. I don't

10:12.981 --> 10:16.085
know how the law is. Well, what do you think? Who 
works the most? The people who live in Mexico or the

10:21.192 --> 10:23.595
people who live here? Yes, but as I say, like there 
in the dining room when I was working there, many

10:23.776 --> 10:37.234
girls who didn't want to work, then the... The man 
in charge said, well, if you don't want to do the

10:38.294 --> 10:48.246
work, go and let someone else come and do the work. 
Because the work is needed. And if you don't want to

10:49.808 --> 10:55.676
do it, it's very hard for the people here to get the 
work from others. They get the work and they don't

10:55.696 --> 10:59.861
pay for it. Better go and let someone else come and 
do the work. And that's how they did it. Because

11:05.362 --> 11:08.145
that man didn't even want to play with the boys. 
Because there were many who threw themselves with

11:08.165 --> 11:19.899
glasses, because there they had to wash glasses

11:08.165 --> 11:19.899
and small and large dishes and cups and everything 
they had to wash there. Yes. I, the time I lived

11:20.820 --> 11:23.202
there, I was working in the washing machine. I was 
working there. And that's where I saw many of them,

11:24.964 --> 11:33.394
that they were better occupied than because they 
weren't going to play. But it's very hard to fight

11:35.230 --> 11:39.617
with people like that. And that's what my girls 
don't want anymore. Well, is life different here

11:43.042 --> 11:48.090
in Mexico? Well, it's

11:50.073 --> 11:55.721
different, you know why? As I was reading a 
newspaper now that says that Here in this place

12:05.909 --> 12:09.253
there was a quake. Do you know what a quake is? A 
quake. They call it earthquake, I think that's how

12:14.220 --> 12:18.846
they call it in English. Earthquake. In 
Nicaragua. Yes, yes, earthquake. Well, there I

12:22.891 --> 12:29.760
was reading that a Mexican priest says, and 
another priest, do you know what priest? Yes. He's

12:30.861 --> 12:32.023
from the Pichas. Yes. from Nicaragua, he wrote him 
a letter, telling him that he was asleep when he

12:33.331 --> 12:46.870
heard a noise in Nicaragua. He said, then I woke up 
and I looked out the window, through the window, he

12:46.890 --> 12:56.944
said, and then I looked at the bed, I saw that the bed 
moved like this, over there, over here, the bed. He

12:56.964 --> 13:02.292
said, then I went outside and I looked out the 
street, there was a lot of people in the street.

13:03.908 --> 13:08.255
from all those who had left so that they wouldn't be 
killed. Life here is very hard right now. And there

13:12.482 --> 13:21.476
are several problems in that place, because 
people are very poor. Very, very poor. They work

13:23.118 --> 13:31.772
and they don't get paid enough so that they can live 
and dress and have something. They don't get paid

13:32.191 --> 13:35.756
anything. And that's a very hard thing for people. 
And slavery, do you know what slavery is? Yes.

13:45.330 --> 13:47.213
Slavery is slavery? Slavery is when, like here, 
you have to obey what the government says. Yes. And

13:55.685 --> 13:56.967
you don't get a job. or they don't pay him and he has 
to live in misery. He's a slave. That's what he

14:02.886 --> 14:05.429
tells them to do. He says, those are several 
problems. We have to help the people. We have to pay

14:13.621 --> 14:18.568
them and treat them well. That happened in Mexico 
last year. But not now. This revolution was what

14:24.757 --> 14:30.383
fought for slavery. But not all governments have 
done well for the nation. I'm going to mention

14:38.673 --> 14:43.879
López Mateo, who did a lot for Mexico. And he said he 
was going to do everything he could so that Mexico

14:44.095 --> 14:50.661
would rise up and play just like everyone else. I 
don't know how he's going to run, because I don't

14:50.762 --> 14:58.909
receive papers from there. And that's what he 
needs. As they say, there are still people in

15:00.111 --> 15:08.739
Mexico who don't have a place to live. Like this 
bishop Flores, who is Mexican. It was Patricio

15:14.183 --> 15:18.349
Flores, the obispo. It was in September, the 16th 
of September, when they inaugurated the

15:18.790 --> 15:29.025
independence in Mexico. So he wrote, he sent a 
paper saying that still in Mexico, not everyone

15:29.065 --> 15:38.078
could scream that it was time for freedom. He said, 
because there are many people who don't have a

15:38.459 --> 15:41.423
place to live. so that everyone has the freedom to 
live. Well, as I say, the people who live in the town

15:48.504 --> 16:02.418
are working in the town, but the people who live 
outside the town, on the ranch, life is different

15:48.504 --> 16:02.418
here. That's what I think. But that's why... I've 
read books, because the government of Mexico gave

16:12.757 --> 16:23.533
land to all the people to make them live. But as many 
people say in Mexico, many people say that they

16:23.553 --> 16:30.744
don't want to work. And many work the land and many 
don't work it. But I say for me that the government

16:34.169 --> 16:37.414
is to blame for all this. The government should 
have people who work in those lands. But here it's

16:43.698 --> 16:47.502
the same, and in Mexico too, I think. If the 
government sends, like the president, something

16:47.522 --> 16:53.649
is happening here. He sends a man to come here. And 
here the businessmen realize everything. Well,

17:03.540 --> 17:06.743
or they find him, look at him. And then they say, 
here, take this amount of money, and you say you're

17:07.702 --> 17:14.168
going to fix it. That's the way you can fix 
anything. That's how you fix it. And that's what

17:18.692 --> 17:24.378
happens there, and that's what happens here. I've 
read a lot of books, and a lot of newspapers, and

17:24.398 --> 17:30.523
that's where I realize all that. But, well, I don't 
know what they'll be like. Because many times, A

17:35.984 --> 17:39.368
lot of people say that you don't know anything. 
That you're ignorant and all that. But if you don't

17:43.773 --> 17:46.556
know how to read, you don't know anything. But if 
you know how to read, you do know a lot. Because if

17:48.959 --> 17:53.144
you read the newspapers, you realize how 
everything is happening. And that's what's going

17:53.484 --> 17:56.768
on right now. Like here, with me, I have a insurance 
that I'm paying. One of the collectors who came

18:01.073 --> 18:04.337
to... He came

18:05.600 --> 18:13.409
in the car and he stopped outside and he talked to 
me. I said, well, what's going on here? He said, you

18:16.353 --> 18:22.620
don't know that I'm coming to see you, that you pay 
more in insurance. I said, yes, I pay, but look, I

18:24.502 --> 18:27.305
don't support you. He said, no, just write that you 
are paying more. I said, you go, otherwise I lose

18:31.791 --> 18:34.594
it. Why should I be afraid that I'm paying more in 
insurance? You go and I go. I said, don't bully me

18:44.409 --> 18:47.075
like that. And don't bully people either. That's 
what I told them. That a lot of people don't look or

18:54.348 --> 18:58.877
know anything. Because something happened to me 
since 1925, here in Bryan. One of my boys, who is in

19:08.313 --> 19:20.650
Houston, the youngest of the men, he was about six 
months old when he was born. And one of the security

19:20.730 --> 19:26.438
collectors from America passed by. And when the 
boy was out there on the street, He stopped with me,

19:29.890 --> 19:38.059
I was getting there, I was at work, he stopped with 
me and said to me, hey, don't you want to put your

19:29.890 --> 19:38.059
girls in security? Look, here they are, a car can 
come, a horse can come, a cow can hit them and you

19:38.079 --> 19:47.389
need to put them

19:38.079 --> 19:47.389
in security. Well, I already had, it seems to me 
that two, two or three had security. And I put this

19:54.717 --> 19:57.380
one smaller. And he told me, he said, look, When he 
turns 20, they will pay you as if you were dead. But

20:05.280 --> 20:06.081
he lied to me. When he turned 20, I didn't know 
anything. I went to the police station to talk to

20:12.727 --> 20:19.534
the manager and I told him. He said, no, that man 
cheated on you. He didn't tell you the truth. When

20:26.641 --> 20:41.830
he was 20 years old, because he was paying five 
cents a week at that time, and when he was 20 years

20:26.641 --> 20:41.830
old, they were going to pay him like he was dead. And 
I went to the neighbor and said, no, this man is

20:41.930 --> 20:45.096
lying. Come here, I'll bring you another gift. 
That's what you're going to do. When he turns 20

20:49.662 --> 20:54.830
years old, he can get a bigger insurance. That's 
what I should have told you. I should have told you

20:58.655 --> 21:04.724
that I was going to pay you when I was dead. And 
that's where I got all that. And when Mr. Ellis, who

21:07.630 --> 21:17.681
ran the insurance at Southern Life, found me in 
1945, then I didn't have insurance, nor this, nor

21:07.630 --> 21:17.681
my wife. The boys did have it in the other. And he 
told me, hey, do you want to put, do you want to take

21:20.363 --> 21:27.251
this insurance? I told him, I told him, well, it's 
not bad, I know well that it's good, Alex. But... If

21:38.343 --> 21:49.194
you're going to tell me the truth, and you're not 
going to deceive me, because you don't lose

21:38.343 --> 21:49.194
anything, I'm the one who's going to lose the money 
I'm paying. If right now you say something and then

21:49.215 --> 21:56.162
it turns out that it's not like you told me, and 
you're going to make a fool of yourself. Two times

21:56.182 --> 21:58.224
we met and that's how we were. Another one came and 
said, look, here are my... I said, well, he can say

22:01.467 --> 22:06.713
the same thing, but what had happened to me, I 
didn't want to be trusted anymore. Well, finally,

22:07.908 --> 22:17.039
the third time he came to find me, I thought, I 
thought, I said, well, I have insurance. Neither

22:17.059 --> 22:18.440
me, nor my wife, nor this one. And if something 
happens to me, it's worth more to take it. And I took

22:23.266 --> 22:23.546
it. And since then I'm paying that insurance. But I 
always talked to him. And I wanted to tell him about

22:28.392 --> 22:34.759
that man who came with me here, but I didn't tell him 
anything. And another American, not from the same

22:36.983 --> 22:42.429
place, came to collect the money here. I wasn't 
here at home, my wife was. And she paid him, but she

22:46.413 --> 22:51.539
didn't sign the card. When my wife came, she told 
me. I paid him, he came to collect the insurance,

22:54.061 --> 23:00.028
and he took the money, but he didn't sign the card. 
And I put on the card what day he had come, how much he

23:00.088 --> 23:04.172
had taken. When another came the next month, I 
already told him, I said, why do you do that with the

23:05.401 --> 23:12.272
people? You shouldn't do that. You are the 
culprits of the evil you do. We don't, we comply

23:18.582 --> 23:23.810
with payments, but you don't carry your books 
correctly. He said, well, I don't know why that man

23:23.830 --> 23:27.636
did that to you. I don't know either. So he left and 
didn't come back. Because I don't know where all

23:32.873 --> 23:41.485
that will be. Because right now, all the 
businesses that I did when I was working, right now

23:42.747 --> 23:56.686
I don't owe anything to the house. I'm paying the 
taxes, the security of the house and I pay the bills

24:02.523 --> 24:06.567
and everything. And since I used to take out a 
hundred times credit in the loans that are here in

24:06.587 --> 24:17.016
the town, the way it is that I fall into cards that if 
I need money, that I go, that I just go and sign. No.

24:17.176 --> 24:21.681
When I can, when I see that I can pay that money, I go 
and take it out. But since right now I'm not

24:21.701 --> 24:29.147
working, I'm going to take out the money, how am I 
going to pay it? It's going to be bad. It's going to

24:30.008 --> 24:31.990
be bad to take it out. But as long as they're helping 
me, I'm doing fine. That's why. But I don't owe the

24:38.567 --> 24:40.009
house anything. I wanted to put a chiropractor on 
it. My wife had a lot of portraits here. My daughter

24:48.196 --> 24:58.025
took them off because she was going to put a thin 
chiropractor instead of paper and paint. Just

24:58.045 --> 24:59.146
like I put it there. I want to put it here. Nezke just 
left these there to remove them

25:00.725 --> 25:09.976
and put the syrup. It's not very expensive, it's 
expensive right now, but... Last year it was... It

25:17.285 --> 25:20.128
was 75 cents, 80, the leaf. And when I bought that 
one, I paid 1.18 pesos. Who knows, now it's worth

25:24.474 --> 25:26.436
1.25. That's what I think. Because it's going to be 
like... It's been two years since I bought this

25:31.758 --> 25:35.082
diary. That's always why I saw the paper that was 
very... Let's see, give me the

25:35.142 --> 25:44.254
plate. Here's the plate. And

25:45.035 --> 25:53.767
that's what we're trying to do. To live well with 
the people, the neighbors, because otherwise we

25:53.787 --> 26:00.195
can't. But as I was reading in this new paper that I 
have, the one that fell yesterday, that this

26:01.019 --> 26:27.432
bishop Flores says, that he doesn't know why among 
us people say, we live,

26:01.019 --> 26:27.432
that if he has and is living in another way, One 
says, how come I don't have that one? But that

26:33.539 --> 26:35.561
shouldn't be like that. One should think in 
another way. Because everything is here. He gives

26:42.671 --> 26:46.056
us and He takes away from us. Because I am also 
reading the Holy Scripture. Do you know what it is?

26:49.621 --> 26:49.901
Yes. Well, I am reading it. Every night I read a 
little. As there is in the Holy Scripture, there is

26:56.711 --> 26:58.313
a... whose name is Job. You haven't

27:02.760 --> 27:10.068
read the Bible. And there it says that this man 
was... well, he was a very good man, and all the time

27:10.088 --> 27:27.266
he treated people well, and he feared God in 
everything. He wasn't... How can I put it? that he

27:30.592 --> 27:35.218
spoke ill and that he spoke against God. He never 
said it. And it says in the Scripture, saying,

27:37.501 --> 27:49.998
being God with his children outside, Satan comes 
and says to God, where does Satan come from? He

27:50.038 --> 27:57.308
says, I come to turn the earth around, to see 
everything, to see all the kingdoms it has and

27:50.038 --> 27:57.308
everything. Then God says to him, don't you 
remember my servant Job? Who is a fearful man to

28:03.309 --> 28:08.534
God, who has never sinned, nor does he curse 
anyone. He said no. He said, well, try it. Just

28:11.797 --> 28:13.759
don't kill him. Well, God sent him, because he was 
Satan. Well,

28:19.064 --> 28:26.451
after a few days, he had a lot of A lot of animals of 
all kinds. A lot of them. And there were a lot of

28:32.797 --> 28:40.564
people who were taking care of the animals. Where? 
Where? These animals? Like cows, horses,

28:46.629 --> 28:47.890
donkeys, camels. Where? Where are these animals? 
No, they don't say where, they just say that they

28:50.092 --> 28:55.057
are here. Ah, yes. Well, then... He was sitting 
there when a man came in a hurry. He came and said,

29:05.540 --> 29:10.750
I'm here to tell you that another tribe is coming. 
They killed all those who were taking care of the

29:10.790 --> 29:18.604
camels and took them all away. That man didn't 
leave when another man came. And he said, I'm

29:23.941 --> 29:33.952
coming to tell you, I escaped and killed everyone 
else, I escaped to come and tell you that they took

29:23.941 --> 29:33.952
all the horses. And Taino went to the other one. And 
everyone came and told him about all the animals

29:36.195 --> 29:38.718
that he had to steal. And he came, he had three 
children and two daughters. When he came, Taino

29:43.062 --> 29:49.830
went to the last one, when the other one came and 
told him, well, you know, I'm coming to tell you

29:43.062 --> 29:49.830
that that your children were having a banquet. Do 
you know what a banquet is? Banquet. Banquet? Yes.

30:01.516 --> 30:06.382
Well, he said, and they were eating and drinking. 
When a strong wind came from this side and threw the

30:06.442 --> 30:13.511
house on top of them.

30:13.531 --> 30:19.699
Then the wife of that man told them, she said, you 
see, They took everything. And why don't you curse

30:22.155 --> 30:24.518
your God? He says to him, woman, you speak like a 
foolish woman. Do you know what he means? He says,

30:33.566 --> 30:36.970
you speak like a foolish woman. God gave me 
everything I had. When I was born, I didn't have

30:38.712 --> 30:44.557
clothes. God gave it to me. God took it from me. It 
was all His. He knows what he's

30:50.543 --> 30:56.690
doing. That's how it happened. After that, there 
was a time when Job didn't say anything, nor did he

30:59.233 --> 31:05.741
curse God, or anything. And then, after that, 
Satan came and took him back. And from the head to

31:10.587 --> 31:14.852
the feet, he put a leper on him. Do you know what a 
leper is? Yes. Well, he put it all over his body. You

31:19.855 --> 31:23.299
see, he was suffering. And the woman said to him, 
why are you hurting him?

31:29.325 --> 31:31.448
What he did was that he put ashes on his head. And 
everyone was waiting for the will of God. God no

31:34.992 --> 31:40.558
longer did anything, nor did he say anything. Then 
he healed him and gave him more wealth than he had.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.006
And he had seven children. Five men and three 
women. And he said, there were no women in any tribe

31:53.690 --> 32:00.635
as beautiful as they were. But he didn't sin. 
That's what I say. Why do we admire other people and

32:06.443 --> 32:12.670
think bad of other people? We have envy. Do you know 
what envy is? Yes, envy. Envy. Envy to envy others.

32:19.419 --> 32:29.451
And they say that we should see what happened with 
Christ and John the Baptist. that neither one nor

32:30.224 --> 32:33.368
the other spoke a word. They had nothing to do with 
each other. And that's how we should be. Yes,

32:39.496 --> 32:41.418
that's right. Tell me, please, a little more about 
your life in Piedras Negras. During the years 1912

32:49.749 --> 32:55.236
to 1915,

32:56.549 --> 33:06.864
Tell me a little more about your life during these 
years. Well, since the 12th we came here to Piedras

33:07.024 --> 33:14.536
Negras. It was called San Carlos, that place. San 
Carlos. San Carlos was the name of that place. And

33:23.448 --> 33:25.771
that place was where the general office was. And 
there was another place called Victoria. We were

33:29.497 --> 33:32.001
close to that place, Victoria. They were, as they 
say in agriculture, sowing everything. They were

33:39.132 --> 33:47.464
sowing, they named it, who knows if you understand 
that, the room. like the one who has his mule shots,

33:49.520 --> 34:08.207
all his skulls, harvests, and everything, and he 
does all his work, and with the owner of the ranch,

33:49.520 --> 34:08.207
he gives him a part, and the man who sows takes three 
parts, this is the fourth. That's where they were

34:09.889 --> 34:12.713
sowing there. And we picked up the harvest, all the 
cotton, what we sowed, we sold it like that, We used

34:19.608 --> 34:24.275
to sell the paca in San Carlos.

34:25.277 --> 34:28.101
And that's how we spent our lives there. When we 
needed clothes, shoes, supplies, we went to

34:28.121 --> 34:37.435
Piedras Negras. We sold what we had and went to 
Aguilepas to buy what we needed. Shoes, clothes,

34:42.904 --> 34:48.332
pants, hats. And so we were going, we were sowing, 
we were working on the land. What was hard there,

34:54.456 --> 35:10.175
because there were times like these northern 
rivers that passed in the past, I remembered that

34:54.456 --> 35:10.175
you have to water the land to plant in February. You 
water the land to plant in March. And there were

35:12.979 --> 35:17.745
times when the north was like this, the northern 
rivers that came, and you had to walk between the

35:12.979 --> 35:17.745
water. They gave us water up to here.

35:24.092 --> 35:31.340
And it was better to walk in the water than to walk 
outside because when we went out, it seemed that

35:24.092 --> 35:31.340
the cold air was cutting us. And those seven years 
were to be watered in February and we had to water in

35:31.360 --> 35:41.151
May or June so that the corn was sown, the cotton was 
sown, and so on. As I told you, my wife, my children,

35:41.924 --> 35:54.415
all the suffering that I went through, now it's all 
coming back to me. In what year were you married to

35:54.436 --> 35:57.979
your wife? I got married in 1915. Three years after 
you went there. Three years after... Yes, because

36:08.268 --> 36:10.210
I didn't think of getting married. That's the 
truth, as always. When the revolution was still in

36:12.000 --> 36:18.190
Mexico, it was just around the corner. Nothing 
stopped. I wanted to get involved in the

36:20.033 --> 36:24.379
revolution.

36:26.463 --> 36:37.800
And a sister of my father told me, I'll take that off 
your head, you're leaving, we don't know where

36:26.463 --> 36:37.800
you're going to stay. You're not going to know more 
about us. And every now and then she would tell me to

36:41.314 --> 36:45.322
look for a girl and marry her. And stop going there. 
So many have died there that they don't even know

36:46.946 --> 36:51.234
where they're going to stay. And that's why I got 
married. No, because I didn't want to get married.

36:56.144 --> 36:58.168
I still wanted to get into the revolution. A lot of 
women got involved. One of the women who got

37:01.385 --> 37:04.230
involved became a colonel. She was in Mexico City. 
That's why I didn't get involved. I thought it

37:13.685 --> 37:18.372
would go well. I got married in 1915.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.624
It was September 15th.

37:28.810 --> 37:52.962
Suegro,

37:28.810 --> 37:52.962
your mother

37:28.810 --> 37:52.962
and you?

37:53.296 --> 37:54.898
His wife died. He was alone. I was with him. I wanted 
to help him. I wanted to help him. I wanted my wife to

38:05.773 --> 38:10.920
do the work. But he left. He came here.

38:18.912 --> 38:22.756
And two years after he came, he wrote to us, asking 
us to come. Well, seeing how life was there in Duro,

38:23.036 --> 38:29.423
I thought about coming. I was struggling because 
when you don't understand the language, it's very

38:30.304 --> 38:39.414
hard for you. For everyone. It's hard for the 
people who don't understand anything. Because

38:45.205 --> 38:51.354
they can't see things, they can't ask questions, 
they don't know the language. They can't ask

38:51.374 --> 38:56.161
questions because they don't know the language. 
And it's hard for some people. When you come here,

38:59.666 --> 39:03.112
you can't understand a language. And that's what I 
say, that you can't. Because... Sometimes they

39:07.090 --> 39:12.797
even make a mistake by saying one thing and then 
another.

39:16.862 --> 39:18.484
And that's not good. And that's why we came here. As 
I told you, we had to stay in that place. Sowing,

39:26.994 --> 39:27.715
yes. But after the revolution, not when the 
revolution didn't... Well, it was all over. It was

39:39.145 --> 39:56.429
all over because the man who lived in that place 
told everyone that he was being persecuted by the

39:39.145 --> 39:56.429
government. He said, I'm not going to be able to 
help them like I used to. I have to move them to the

40:03.336 --> 40:08.841
other side, which was here, to Texas. He said, when 
I can, I'll send them everything they need here.

40:14.567 --> 40:16.408
But if I can't, I can't. Because if I send them, the 
government takes them away. It's not good for you

40:19.912 --> 40:21.073
or anything. It's not good for the government. The 
problem is that you're going to plant The land,

40:27.027 --> 40:33.535
as they are sowing. Oh, they will give me whatever 
you want. You will have to work. I wake up and see

40:38.382 --> 40:41.245
that there is no help anymore. They are making us 
live as they could. If there was help, they would

40:44.169 --> 40:48.234
give it to you, but if not, they wouldn't. It's like 
I say, but... And when that revolution...

40:48.254 --> 40:55.043
that people said... The government soldiers were 
doing a lot of things with the families. They were

41:03.338 --> 41:08.706
killing a lot of people and stealing a lot of 
people. Almost all of the people who came from

41:08.746 --> 41:14.754
here, they left everything here. They left all the 
food. They lost because they did nothing. We

41:21.444 --> 41:23.747
stayed there, they didn't do anything. And all 
that was left, the poor people who were there, who

41:25.010 --> 41:32.118
were there before those people came out of here, 
that was the one who took everything. And those who

41:32.138 --> 41:34.821
left that, they lost it. They came to this side. A 
lot of people come to this side during these days.

41:42.670 --> 41:44.032
Your relatives too? Your relatives too come here? 
They came here? They came here to Texas, all the

41:50.120 --> 41:53.123
people. All the people, your mom and dad too? No, my 
mom died in this place, in San Carlos. She died in

42:03.575 --> 42:06.297
1914. And my dad, no, he lived, he died until now, 
two years ago. He bought here, Have you heard of

42:19.094 --> 42:24.421
that beautiful valley? On the side of Matamoros? 
Yes, I know that beautiful valley. Well, near that

42:27.024 --> 42:30.128
beautiful valley he bought a land. A land? 100 
acres of land. Yes. He bought there. And there he

42:37.097 --> 42:38.498
died. And two brothers because he got married 
after my mother died. Yes. And that family was in

42:41.402 --> 42:44.646
the other woman. There they are. This is a portrait 
of my father and my brother over

42:46.191 --> 42:56.433
there. Why does your family come to Piedras 
Negras? For what reason? Well, you can't see that

43:06.918 --> 43:12.104
we went from here to there to sow. It was my father 
and me and this man. We got together, we got married

43:15.948 --> 43:19.892
and that's it. And they were also sowing. They were 
living, as they say, in the hospital San Jose. Yes.

43:28.642 --> 43:30.124
They were retired from us. But now, we've been 
certified by her. Oh, yes. And mine is up there. Oh,

43:39.923 --> 43:44.748
it's for...

43:39.923 --> 43:44.748
How do you say it? For the wool. For the wool. Yes, 
for the wool. And yours is up there too. Yes, I have

43:53.739 --> 44:01.889
it up there because there are times when I have to 
ask for it from the Social Security, or from the

43:53.739 --> 44:01.889
Guadalajara. Yes, yes. And that's why I have it in a 
bag. It's a very good thing. Here I had it, but now

44:04.632 --> 44:07.215
I'm taking it off and putting it back on. In 1961. 
Yes, the same year as you. It was in 1954 when I

44:15.076 --> 44:16.699
escaped. The first of April. The first of April, 
okay. In 1954. Because my two girls were in the

44:22.949 --> 44:27.916
service. Yes. And here, some friends, who knows if 
they know them, I don't know, They work in the

44:37.891 --> 44:39.933
school. One of them is called Pete Rodriguez. And 
the other one is called Pablo Rodriguez, who is the

44:46.581 --> 44:53.750
one you see in the Esviza Hall dining room. They are 
the ones who helped us fill the blanks and

44:53.810 --> 44:56.673
everything. And they used to tell me before, they 
used to tell me, you must become an American

44:56.693 --> 45:05.063
citizen, because if you think of residing here, so 
that the law can hear it and support it. Because

45:09.870 --> 45:15.167
many times, in some works of the state or 
elsewhere, people who are not citizens cannot

45:09.870 --> 45:15.167
work. And so you cannot work.
