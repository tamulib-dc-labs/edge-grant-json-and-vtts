00:01.972 --> 00:13.805
Political science, who came here from the 
northeast,

00:01.972 --> 00:13.805
looked very, very sophisticated, sounded very 
sophisticated. At its first meeting in the

00:13.825 --> 00:31.084
academic council, which was composed of deans and 
department heads and vice presidents, and this

00:13.825 --> 00:31.084
was during the 60s when there were campus 
disruptions around the nation, very few here This

00:32.043 --> 00:54.220
man came in at his first academic council meeting 
saying that A&M was sitting on a powder keg, it was

00:32.043 --> 00:54.220
about to explode, that the students were near 
white, and that he was the only one on the campus who

00:32.043 --> 00:54.220
recognized this, and the only one that the 
students had confidence that they could share

00:32.043 --> 00:54.220
their concerns with. But that didn't exactly get 
him off to the best start with deans and department

00:55.550 --> 01:19.187
heads who had been here for a number of years who 
really thought they had some idea about what A&M

00:55.550 --> 01:19.187
was like and were awed in admiration about this man 
who had been here for a month and understood so much

00:55.550 --> 01:19.187
more than they did.

01:19.507 --> 01:21.270
Later, this same person came into Dean Hubert's 
office when I was there. This was probably three

01:25.132 --> 01:28.056
years later or something like that. He had not 
adjusted A&M much better, nor had A&M adjusted him

01:28.837 --> 01:33.705
very well. And I don't remember what the topic was, 
but I remember the man saying, Dean Hubert, if you

01:35.487 --> 01:45.643
don't agree to this, I'll have no choice other than 
to submit my resignation. And very deliberately.

01:47.744 --> 02:00.741
Dean Hubert opened the bottom right-hand drawer 
of his desk, took out a blank sheet of paper and

01:47.744 --> 02:00.741
said, Professor Department Head, I accept your 
resignation. The Department Head was absolutely

02:00.761 --> 02:05.907
shocked and had no choice other than to follow 
through with what he just said. And that convinced

02:07.009 --> 02:16.401
me forever and ever that I would never make a threat 
that I wasn't willing to live with. I've heard some

02:16.685 --> 02:30.760
stories about faculty members who apparently 
came here with fraudulent resumes, vitas, etc.,

02:16.685 --> 02:30.760
and this being called to Dean Hubert's attention. 
Can you share any examples of that? Well, one of

02:35.826 --> 02:46.017
them was a man who came here and he was the director 
of the Creative Application of Technology in

02:35.826 --> 02:46.017
Education, CATE. And Dean Hubert was always 
interested in

02:47.009 --> 02:59.303
educational technology.

02:59.323 --> 03:02.247
And I'll come back later to more of that. But this 
man came in with electronic teaching devices,

03:02.267 --> 03:13.019
television, and all that, and strongly 
opinionated. And there were some people who did

03:15.933 --> 03:32.192
not respond very well to him and did some checking 
and found out that he had falsified his doctoral

03:15.933 --> 03:32.192
degree from UCLA and when Frank Hubert confronted 
him with this, the man's response was, I thought I

03:15.933 --> 03:32.192
earned a PhD. And he was gone pretty quickly and he 
did not last very long. We had another person in

03:38.860 --> 03:44.387
education psychology who came in with a prolific 
list of publications.

03:52.271 --> 03:53.814
Just overwhelming. And after having several 
graduate students

03:54.575 --> 04:12.703
be surprised by some of the statements that the man 
made, they started checking his list of

03:54.575 --> 04:12.703
publications and found that it was probably 80% 
fraudulent. And again, he left very quickly and

04:13.561 --> 04:24.340
surprisingly enough went to a more lucrative job 
in private industry. Alright, now let's go back to

04:24.360 --> 04:26.283
your trail. You became the associate dean of 
liberal arts and the dean was then? David Maxwell.

04:38.823 --> 04:42.306
Describe, Dave, his style. David Maxwell came in 
from Indiana University.

04:50.073 --> 04:58.881
And he was wound very tight.

04:59.681 --> 05:07.108
He was very outgoing, casual in his approach, yet 
high standards. had his North Carolinian charm. I

05:11.563 --> 05:13.645
think he was from North Carolina. He made people 
feel very much at ease. The biggest surprise I got

05:17.208 --> 05:23.875
from David was one fairly wintery day, I guess. We 
had one of our rare snow falls and so we all got to

05:23.975 --> 05:37.348
work and about nine o'clock got the phone call and 
it was David Maxwell. And I said, yes. And he said,

05:38.544 --> 05:40.186
what are you doing at work? And I said, well, I don't 
know what you're asking. I work here. He said,

05:42.749 --> 05:44.051
well, what about the snow? And I said, well, what 
about it? He said, who else is there? And I said,

05:48.956 --> 05:49.957
well, let me put it this way. You're the only one not 
here. And so with my Texas background, thinking

05:52.300 --> 05:59.529
that someone who'd been in Indiana for a while 
would not be the least bit perturbed, he said,

05:52.300 --> 05:59.529
well, why don't you send everyone home? And I said, 
well, why would we send anyone home? I said, you

06:02.892 --> 06:05.375
know, it's really great, because there are almost 
no people here. We're getting a lot of work done.

06:06.995 --> 06:08.557
And by this afternoon, the snow will be gone. So 
it'll be a lot safer for them to go home at the

06:08.878 --> 06:11.942
regular time. He said, I'll see you in just a few 
minutes. About 15 minutes, he was there in the

06:14.125 --> 06:18.010
office. Day worked. He was an economist. And the 
economics department was one of the rising stars

06:21.535 --> 06:32.130
in the College of Liberal Arts, as far as the 
reputation of the faculty members. But like I

06:32.610 --> 06:36.816
said, the thing I remember most about Day His 
charm, his warmth,

06:37.808 --> 06:47.046
and his standards. Key decisions, plus or minus, 
you remember during those years? I think probably

06:51.835 --> 06:56.003
the key decision was, again, allocation of 
resources to the Economics Department because it

06:56.557 --> 07:02.784
received a real disproportionate share there for 
a while. But it was one of those areas that I think

07:02.804 --> 07:16.680
Frank Hubert had been directly involved in 
highlighting is this is one of the departments

07:02.804 --> 07:16.680
that we really wanted to bring to the forefront 
within the College of Liberal Arts. Q Do you have

07:16.700 --> 07:21.885
any idea how that decision came and with them? A I 
really don't. I would like to know. It may have been

07:26.898 --> 07:38.377
one of those that the time was right, and certainly 
we went with a more conservative economist. I

07:38.397 --> 07:46.030
think that fit in with the ideas of a lot of the 
members of the Board of Regents, so I would suspect

07:38.397 --> 07:46.030
that they were involved in that. Certainly it was 
not on the liberal side. I've heard stories from

07:50.998 --> 07:53.142
Neil Greenhut that when he came for an interview 
that President Rutter gave him a long lecture

07:53.628 --> 08:06.563
about not being liberal, liberal, liberal, which 
was a good deal of a waste of time saying that to

07:53.628 --> 08:06.563
Greenwald. He certainly wasn't going to be 
liberal. That economics emphasis began under

08:10.347 --> 08:16.154
Hubert. Under Hubert. And then continued under 
Maxwell. That's right. Would the fact that

08:19.784 --> 08:25.431
Maxwell was an economist, reckon that had 
anything to do with his being selected as dean? I

08:25.672 --> 08:27.294
don't think it hurt him. Okay. That's the answer I 
would have given. Because as far as I recall, it was

08:30.798 --> 08:33.301
a real search. Yes. And House of the Liberal Arts 
was housed in those days? Still in the activity

08:40.531 --> 08:42.794
building. Okay. Well, take it back. Take that 
back. I guess by that time, we had moved into Rudder

08:46.018 --> 08:48.441
Tower. Who

08:49.062 --> 08:59.852
were the key staff members in the college? Were 
there key people in the office? Peggy Ritchie was

09:05.738 --> 09:10.542
there who went with education. Mrs. Frank Lowe, 
when I first went to the office. That was one of the

09:15.407 --> 09:17.449
stories, again, that I enjoyed. Because when I 
went there, there was a little half moon behind the

09:18.256 --> 09:27.985
academic building that had reserved parking.

09:28.005 --> 09:33.350
And so Mrs. Franklow told me what I would need to do 
to get my reserved parking. And I said, Mrs.

09:33.370 --> 09:37.014
Franklow, I really don't need reserved parking. I 
get here early enough that it's not a problem. And I

09:39.596 --> 09:41.057
don't need to park right there. And I don't move my 
car during the day. And so I don't really need it.

09:44.861 --> 09:46.963
And I remember her saying, Barry, clearly Dean 
McCandless, the associate dean, has always had a

09:47.180 --> 09:52.786
reserved parking space. And I said, you know, Ms. 
Frankl, I think I'd really like to get one of those

09:53.167 --> 09:57.131
reserved parking spaces. So anyway, I learned 
that very quickly.

10:05.460 --> 10:14.790
After Mrs. Frankl retired, who, and Peggy Ritchie 
goes to education, I'm trying to remember who,

10:16.222 --> 10:18.765
Mrs. Spinner. Who was the, was there an assistant 
dean? Henry Pope was an assistant dean part of the

10:23.209 --> 10:26.213
time. Jack Humphreys, who went from here to Sam 
Houston and then became president. Saul Ross. And

10:34.421 --> 10:38.406
maybe Ed Hunts was also, and dies as a young man. 
Yes, really an outstanding, later graduate,

10:38.426 --> 10:45.233
really quality person. So mostly, Dean Hubert 
used doctoral students to do a kind of a business

10:45.432 --> 10:58.852
type of arrangement as assistant deans. Now then, 
in liberal arts, was there an assistant dean when

10:59.873 --> 11:08.325
you and Maxwell were working together? Rufus 
Waters served as. What were his duties? more along

11:14.035 --> 11:17.318
the business aspects of it. Alright. Give me a 
typical summary of your specific task as

11:18.319 --> 11:26.867
Associate Dean of Liberal Arts. Primarily, it was 
related to student affairs, because again, at

11:28.508 --> 11:43.502
that point, all the undeclared majors in the 
university were under Liberal Arts, and so I had

11:28.508 --> 11:43.502
the direct responsibility for those all the 
student programs, and a fair amount to do with the

11:44.174 --> 12:03.312
curriculum,

11:44.174 --> 12:03.312
but primarily

11:44.174 --> 12:03.312
the student programs. There must have been some 
nobody else would believe that it really happened

12:03.352 --> 12:10.839
type stories with some students. Well, you know, 
I'm not sure. I'll tell you two quick stories for

12:13.756 --> 12:18.902
the far ends of the spectrum.

12:19.903 --> 12:27.832
Because I would use graduate students to help 
advise and sometimes counsel the students. And

12:27.852 --> 12:32.217
some of them were fairly severe. We had one student 
who was the only one in all the time I've been

12:32.357 --> 12:42.008
involved in higher education that told people 
that he would never to be asked to wait, because I

12:42.393 --> 12:48.904
truly believed him to be suicidal. And I had a 
graduate student who wanted to be a clinical

12:48.924 --> 12:56.316
psychologist named Jan Werner. And so I talked to 
Jan. I said, Jan, are you really sure that you want

12:58.920 --> 13:02.226
to be a clinical psychologist? And she was 
absolutely certain that she did. She wound up

13:08.498 --> 13:18.872
seeing this student several times because he came 
in and was really, really disturbed that we did

13:08.498 --> 13:18.872
everything we could to get him involved with the 
counseling center. But still he had a lot of

13:18.893 --> 13:20.975
problems. And so one day he came in and he had sort of 
latched on to Jan. And Jan almost shuddered when he

13:20.995 --> 13:32.852
came through the door. And she did her job and did it 
well. But when she left, I said, Jan, now think

13:36.391 --> 13:39.114
about it. Would you like to spend the rest of your 
life, professional life, dealing with six to

13:39.134 --> 13:53.366
eight of those people every day with that level of 
difficulty? And she left here to become the

13:53.386 --> 13:59.191
counseling director at Southwest Louisiana. So 
she became a counseling psychologist rather than

13:59.211 --> 14:03.615
a clinical psychologist. But there were a lot of 
students who would come back later and say, Dean

14:04.810 --> 14:20.030
McCown, I want to thank you because without you I 
would never have graduated from A&M. And several

14:20.210 --> 14:23.675
of you would wonder, what in the world did I do? No 
way. One where I really flubbed up, I had a student

14:27.360 --> 14:34.429
who had just gone on academic probation. And his 
name was something like Schultz, and he was from

14:35.557 --> 14:45.051
Schulenburg, and he was failing the first 
semester of freshman German for the third time.

14:45.071 --> 14:49.838
And so I thought, well, I'll start out being a 
little light-hearted.

14:52.341 --> 14:57.849
And I said, why in the world are you having so much 
difficulty in German? I said, isn't it kind of

14:57.869 --> 15:03.117
embarrassing with a name like Schultz from 
Schulenburg, and you're from German for the third

14:57.869 --> 15:03.117
time? And he said, well, it's damn sure not 
inherited. And I said, well, forget the humor. And

15:09.710 --> 15:13.534
I said, well, do you mind telling me why you chose 
German? He said, well, I've got to take some kind of

15:14.055 --> 15:16.237
language. And he said, my brother told me that it 
would probably take me eight semesters to pass

15:16.257 --> 15:21.183
four. And I said, well, did you just really want to 
learn German because of your heritage? Or no, I

15:26.549 --> 15:29.212
just had to take something. I thought I'd take 
that. And I said, well. You are a psychology major.

15:34.678 --> 15:35.198
He said, yes. I said, do you realize you don't have a 
language

15:36.720 --> 15:43.550
requirement? He said, oh my god, I'll kill you. And 
his brother was a history major who did have a

15:45.032 --> 15:51.521
language requirement. But this kid had signed up 
for Germany three times, apparently never looked

15:51.541 --> 15:58.431
at his catalog. Apparently, his advisor had never 
asked him why he was doing this. So he had lost 12

16:02.885 --> 16:14.821
hours of grade points on a course he didn't like, 
didn't want, and didn't really need to earn his

16:02.885 --> 16:14.821
degree. So you can do a lot of things to help 
students avoid difficulty. And one of my lines

16:18.926 --> 16:24.754
was, it's a lot easier to stay out of the hole than it 
is to get out of the hole. So there were a lot of

16:24.774 --> 16:31.963
things that were not overwhelming in the cosmic 
theme of the world. But meant a lot to individual

16:32.585 --> 16:34.387
students. So primarily you were the chief student 
advising officer. That's right. For all of

16:42.998 --> 16:46.322
liberal arts and for all of the undeclared majors. 
So you didn't have to deal with the, normally with

16:46.422 --> 16:51.168
the faculty matters. To an extent. Because again, 
basically at that time the dean's office was

16:52.049 --> 16:57.196
essentially a two-man show. And so whatever the 
Didn't want to do it. I did. But one of the things

17:03.305 --> 17:14.718
that I did appreciate about them, really everyone 
I've ever worked for, and I feel blessed with, they

17:03.305 --> 17:14.718
gave me my area of responsibility and they let me do 
it. I don't feel I was ever suddenly gassed. I never

17:17.882 --> 17:22.127
felt that I lacked the authority to do what I was 
doing. And all those received a lot of support and I

17:22.147 --> 17:26.592
was grateful for that. They weren't looking over 
my shoulder. During that era, According to the way

17:32.508 --> 17:41.285
students thought of it, what were the tough majors 
and the easy majors on campus? Were there any,

17:41.345 --> 17:43.088
supposing? Well, somewhat facetiously, 
engineering was thought of as pre-business.

17:53.534 --> 17:58.101
Engineering, I think, was always thought of as one 
of the tough majors. I think most of the areas of

17:58.181 --> 18:03.909
science, particularly physical sciences, were 
thought of as demanding. Math was always thought

18:04.250 --> 18:10.019
of to be a tough major.

18:12.142 --> 18:17.750
I think that at that point, business was not 
considered to be one of the most demanding.

18:17.770 --> 18:19.693
Agriculture, several were. more humane than some 
of the others. Local arts, education were the ones

18:23.107 --> 18:35.419
that, the ones that were not science and 
technology oriented were often viewed to be the

18:23.107 --> 18:35.419
ones that were a little less demanding. I make 
believe that I didn't know anything about the

18:35.439 --> 18:41.365
registration system. Describe student 
registration in a typical semester. When I came,

18:47.618 --> 19:02.634
we did the mass registration, and most often at 
SEVISA, which I'm one of the few people in the world

18:47.618 --> 19:02.634
who really thought was pretty good and enjoyed. 
Because in the time that you could get most of the

19:02.654 --> 19:13.305
faculty together in one building and have a chance 
to walk around and see your colleagues and visit,

19:02.654 --> 19:13.305
there was a lot of social interaction. among the 
people, the students, and the faculty. And every

19:18.174 --> 19:27.049
student had to get their assignment signed off by 
the associate dean, as well as a departmental

19:18.174 --> 19:27.049
representative. So in a lot of ways, there was a lot 
of opportunity for personal involvement. And one

19:32.818 --> 19:39.209
of the things that I thought was regrettable, 
there were a lot of people who thought that was the

19:32.818 --> 19:39.209
only time that people got any advisable. As an 
undergraduate, I had always this with Carl

19:40.690 --> 19:42.172
Landis. I knew what I was going to sign up for. So 
when I went over there, it was just the formality of

19:43.895 --> 19:46.859
going through it. If you can't get this, you had 
plan B and all that.

19:53.388 --> 19:56.552
But it was just a mass coming together. One of the 
things I remember that bothered me early was there

19:58.395 --> 20:05.705
was one sheet that had like eight different 
sections of it. And you had to fill it out. And you

20:06.767 --> 20:09.491
had to write your name on each one of them and your 
address. And I thought, my gosh. I still got the

20:10.812 --> 20:12.153
same name. I still got the same address. And so 
anyway, technology has helped eliminate that.

20:20.842 --> 20:25.867
Again, one of the stories, a true story that I 
enjoyed, had a man named Russ Weider in physical

20:20.842 --> 20:25.867
education. He was a combatives expert. He had been 
a professional boxer, a professional wrestler.

20:31.633 --> 20:35.197
He had given platform diving exhibitions. And 
according to Russ, he was one of the first 24

20:40.327 --> 20:44.012
nationally accredited fencing masters in the 
United States. And I used to get a bad time about

20:46.256 --> 20:57.953
fencing, but one day, a student was coming through 
in the summer to register for the fall, and he had to

20:46.256 --> 20:57.953
take a physical education course, and he wasn't 
too involved in that. And he was asking about the

20:57.973 --> 21:05.203
different things he could do and that he could 
take, and one of the things in the list was fencing.

21:06.415 --> 21:08.580
And his response was, I damn sure won't do that. 
I've done that all summer for my daddy. So I

21:12.430 --> 21:19.547
remember asking Russ if he'd be teaching barbed 
wire or chain link next semester. Now, do I

21:20.236 --> 21:31.409
remember that the assistant or associate deans 
kind of all sat near an exit area and you kind of,

21:20.236 --> 21:31.409
after you got your schedule done? Everyone had to 
come through. You had to sign off on the number of

21:32.751 --> 21:35.694
hours and the courses they were taking. So we 
looked at every one of them that went through

21:35.754 --> 21:39.359
there. All right, now let's jump back before coeds 
were here in very large numbers. summer school.

21:49.302 --> 21:54.929
How did summer school differ from the two main 
semesters? Well, I think the main difference was

21:55.310 --> 21:58.114
we started at 7 o'clock in the morning. No air 
conditioning, and so the sun was up early, and we

21:59.015 --> 22:16.177
were up early, and we would go to our classes, and 
most of the summer school was over by noon because

21:59.015 --> 22:16.177
it got so hot in the buildings that you couldn't 
learn or teach very well. Am I correct that Only the

22:17.780 --> 22:21.765
library was air-conditioned? I don't think it was 
even air-conditioned then. I think that was one of

22:24.869 --> 22:26.671
the early ones. I remember graduating in G. 
Raleigh White, and I was so dumb that I wore a suit

22:26.691 --> 22:38.585
under my gown and thought I would die. It was so hot. 
Air-conditioning was relatively late by my value

22:41.789 --> 22:46.555
system. Right, so you're with Maxwell for about 
how long? You're in liberal arts. About a year and a

22:52.947 --> 23:00.417
half, and then I came involved in the cell study and 
did that part of the time, too. Yes, yes, yes.

23:01.518 --> 23:02.720
Describe that. What did that whole effort 
include? This is 1962. No, no, no, 1972. 1972.

23:14.716 --> 23:16.238
Well, it was not long after... Jack Williams came. 
And I know I've told you the story about how I found

23:18.956 --> 23:23.901
out that I was going to be the director. No. Did I 
tell you that? I don't remember that. Well, I had

23:28.166 --> 23:31.849
been asked to serve on one of the committees. And we 
had a meeting of the academic council in the

23:32.570 --> 23:37.595
conference room in the library. And Gordon Sweet 
from the Southern Association came down. And

23:43.221 --> 23:44.923
Horace Byers was there. John Calhoun. Wayne Hall, 
I believe. But anyway, Gordon Sweet was not very

23:49.818 --> 23:53.583
sweet. He was saying that what A&M proposed was an 
absolute full-fledged flaming disaster and

23:53.603 --> 24:07.101
Southern Association probably wouldn't approve 
the way that A&M was proposing to do it. And so

24:07.121 --> 24:13.410
Horace Byers said, well, Gordon, I'm glad you 
brought that up because that's not what we're

24:07.121 --> 24:13.410
going to do. Said, what you have is not right at all, 
and Chuck McCandless is going to be the director of

24:14.167 --> 24:21.914
the self-study. And that was the first I'd ever 
heard of it. I was not asked. Incidentally, I told

24:27.218 --> 24:37.287
this story not very long ago at our coffee meeting, 
and John Calhoun says, I'm the guy who messed it up.

24:37.307 --> 24:43.853
So anyway, after we got through, Bill Barzak, And 
I, and Byers, and probably a couple other went over

24:44.575 --> 24:52.324
to meet with Garden Suite. And so with great skill, 
I picked out members of the steering committee,

24:52.344 --> 25:07.162
and the only one who had any experience on any 
accreditation was Bill Barzak, who had an

24:52.344 --> 25:07.162
editorial responsibility in the previous 
self-study meeting. So we got people who, Tim

25:08.644 --> 25:12.068
Brundage and Chuck Sampson, Some others, none of 
them had any knowledge of the cell study. And

25:17.184 --> 25:36.917
because we knew so little about it, at least we were 
committed by the Southern Association for having

25:17.184 --> 25:36.917
a good cell study, which worked out well, because 
in one of my first meetings with Jack Williams

25:17.184 --> 25:36.917
about the cell study, he told me, Chuck, I know more 
about cell studies than anybody in the country.

25:36.937 --> 25:37.919
And he probably did. And I thought, I know less than 
anyone in the country. And I know I was right. But it

25:45.820 --> 25:57.380
was really a worthwhile learning experience for 
all of us, because it gives you an opportunity to

25:45.820 --> 25:57.380
learn a lot about all aspects of the university. 
And what was most enjoyable from my point of view

25:57.520 --> 26:04.633
was that for some strange reason, Bill and I were 
asked to meet almost every time there was a group

26:05.795 --> 26:09.864
looking at research in the university. At one of 
the meetings they were in there and they were

26:11.347 --> 26:23.854
really bad mouthing the administration of A&M 
because the administration always gives lip

26:11.347 --> 26:23.854
service to the importance of research But look who 
gets all the rewards, and it's always the teaching

26:24.323 --> 26:28.868
faculty." And I literally laughed out loud. I 
said, I'm sorry, but you got to recognize, this is a

26:31.452 --> 26:36.377
side of the coin I have never seen before. But they 
were just as sincere as they could be that they

26:37.218 --> 26:42.245
thought researchers were neglected. And the 
other thing that was enjoyable for someone from

26:43.506 --> 26:51.816
liberal arts and education was there was no 
agreement as to what research is. other than it's

26:52.471 --> 26:56.318
what that particular faculty member did. But you 
take the people in social sciences, their

26:56.338 --> 27:07.999
research was so different from people in cotton 
genetics, and that was so different from physics.

27:08.019 --> 27:13.348
Now, this self-study effort took about how long? 
about two years so you were detached from your

27:14.324 --> 27:36.349
associate deeming i was i started out doing both 
and then and it was housed where uh in the reed

27:14.324 --> 27:36.349
mcdonald building and were there did you have a key 
associate bill barzak all right what about the

27:14.324 --> 27:36.349
person did you have some people doing the 
paperwork that were secretaries, staffers that

27:37.173 --> 27:40.017
were particularly critical? Marilyn Melcher was 
one who did cover the work and she was just a lovely,

27:40.338 --> 27:48.490
lovely person and did a really good job. Did y'all 
have any important recommendations? If in

27:52.336 --> 27:54.279
hindsight now you agree? Oh, I'd have to think 
back. I know that we were very pleased because

27:57.964 --> 28:06.437
almost everything that we recommended was 
accomplished before the visiting committee

27:57.964 --> 28:06.437
came. And

28:08.105 --> 28:19.535
we really did, I believe, and this may not be 
totally objective, but I hope it is, we had a lot of

28:08.105 --> 28:19.535
involvement of a lot of people.

28:22.298 --> 28:25.901
And I think it made a significant difference in the 
development. I'd have to go back and look at some of

28:25.921 --> 28:28.183
the things that were recommended. Because I 
remember saying at the very beginning that if

28:30.145 --> 28:37.572
people believe that what they do makes a 
difference, then they'll be willing to do it

28:38.480 --> 28:39.842
again. If they feel like that it doesn't, then 
they're not going to be very enthused. And that was

28:45.729 --> 28:51.195
one of the major complaints going back to what I 
said about Garden Suite. The way it was originally

28:51.215 --> 28:57.843
set up, it was very heavily 
administrator-oriented.

28:57.863 --> 29:01.467
And one of the things that I heard somewhere in the 
South State that I really think was important.

29:03.894 --> 29:08.940
That is, the administration should keep its head 
in and its hands off. And Jack Williams, again,

29:10.182 --> 29:20.815
being the person that he was and the familiarity of 
himself, did it extremely well. I don't know about

29:20.835 --> 29:26.722
your case, but in my case, I wasn't aware of a 
self-study in the early 60s. There must have been

29:26.742 --> 29:29.766
one every 10 years, but I wasn't aware of it. And I 
certainly was the one that you worked on. Let's go

29:34.389 --> 29:37.432
back and talk about leadership.

29:40.074 --> 29:47.721
Earl Rutter, describe his style and manner. He had 
a military style. He was very much a believer in a

29:51.064 --> 29:59.432
strong administration.

30:01.100 --> 30:10.368
I think he believed that there really was a serious 
business aspect to a university that had to be

30:01.100 --> 30:10.368
considered.

30:11.789 --> 30:16.653
I think Earl Rudder was clearly a man for his time. I 
don't believe that A&M could be the university it

30:16.673 --> 30:26.122
is today without Earl Rudder having been where he 
was when he was. Why? I agree with you, but why? of a

30:32.302 --> 30:33.704
number of reasons. One is that for the former 
students in particular, that Earl Rudder was a

30:33.724 --> 30:40.195
real Aggie, in quotes. And whatever that means to 
any one of them, he was one. There was never any

30:43.781 --> 30:52.575
doubt that he was a real Aggie and that what he 
wanted for A&M had to be right for A&M.

30:54.698 --> 30:59.406
If he said that it was okay for A&M to have optional 
military training, then it must be okay. If it was

31:04.853 --> 31:10.498
okay for women to come to A&M, then it must be okay. 
Someone without the strong convictions about A&M

31:10.518 --> 31:24.472
proposing those very same things would have had 
great difficulty. We had a president who I did not

31:24.492 --> 31:28.836
know well because I was too But what I didn't know 
was very positive, it was David Morgan. And I think

31:32.924 --> 31:39.375
David Morgan impressed me, at least, as someone 
similar to Jack Williams. He was just too soon.

31:42.801 --> 31:43.863
Yeah, he was too soon. And what he proposed for A&M 
was not well received at all. Earl Rudder,

31:54.837 --> 32:02.181
had, I think, some difficulty with some of the 
faculty in that he was not an academician. Earl

32:02.201 --> 32:07.598
Rudder

32:02.201 --> 32:07.598
was not a polished
