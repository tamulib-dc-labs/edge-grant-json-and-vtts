WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:10.462
You might have a date that would be coming in on the 
train from Dallas, Fort Worth. And as I recall,

00:11.744 --> 00:25.259
there was

00:11.744 --> 00:25.259
an evening train about 5 o'clock that they could 
catch and come down. You'd meet them at the

00:26.200 --> 00:28.182
station. you know, take them to their room, 
whatever facilities that, you know, they had.

00:32.896 --> 00:37.903
They had dorms open sometimes, or they could stay 
at a house, you know. And lots of times they would

00:38.524 --> 00:47.477
come down and they would stay with somebody, some 
other local girl who lived here. And then you would

00:48.498 --> 00:53.545
line up for the dance. and little activities. We 
used to go after the dance to a little kind of party

00:56.327 --> 01:08.423
afterwards at the old country club building at the 
Bryan Municipal Lake. That was a favorite place.

01:12.629 --> 01:19.718
You know, you could rent that and meet there after 
the dance, you know, to go all night, you see. And

01:20.440 --> 01:23.183
that was something that you could do. Now, 
generally, these girls came from where? From TSCW

01:29.288 --> 01:37.737
or from SMU or any other school. Who paid their 
railroad? They would do that. Okay. And how were

01:45.424 --> 01:49.688
these young women treated once they arrived in 
College Station?

01:53.498 --> 01:58.311
Well, they, it all depends upon which how you were 
classified. If you were a freshman bringing a

02:02.464 --> 02:12.276
girl, well, you knew that she wasn't looking at 
you, she was looking at the upperclassmen. And

02:12.296 --> 02:15.059
that was the way it went. Now, if you were a senior, 
well, you were looking at other girls that

02:15.139 --> 02:21.467
somebody else had brought, you see. But then 
again, your own date, and lots of them by that time

02:21.927 --> 02:25.952
were... were what we would call senior favorites, 
you know, that the Longhorns called senior

02:25.932 --> 02:34.404
favorites, and they had known each other for a 
while. And that was a little different. Then

02:37.909 --> 02:40.773
senior ring dance was a little special, too, you 
see. I had one answer when I asked how were they

02:41.954 --> 02:46.401
treated, and he said, like royalty. Well, that's 
true. But you know, I remember once there was a, and

02:49.034 --> 02:56.965
you might know this school there in Missouri, 
Stevens. Oh, yes. Stevens College. Stevens

02:58.508 --> 02:59.509
College. As they would take tours, those girls, 
and one of their trains happened to land at College

03:00.931 --> 03:10.705
Station once. Really? for a very quick dance and 
getting back on.

03:20.475 --> 03:28.104
I just know that they had a hard time getting them 
all on the train to leave. Was this while you were a

03:28.805 --> 03:30.067
student? I don't think I was either. I don't think I 
was a student. I may have been, but I didn't know any

03:39.342 --> 03:43.788
of our mediums. Stevens College was then a 
two-year institution on the east end of Broadway

03:43.848 --> 03:59.268
in downtown Columbia, Missouri, and had a high 
reputation as a finishing school for southern

03:43.848 --> 03:59.268
ladies. Correct. And they...

04:05.697 --> 04:11.317
were supposedly, if they went to Stevens, 
supposedly they came from a prestigious family

04:05.697 --> 04:11.317
and so forth. And I'm smiling at the potential 
combination of the Aggie energy and the Stevens

04:16.075 --> 04:19.919
girls.

04:24.584 --> 04:37.298
Let's see, the student indulgences of that time, 
tobacco and alcohol and did undergraduate smoke

04:24.584 --> 04:37.298
much then?

04:40.622 --> 04:46.048
I don't, they did but I don't think they, did to an 
excess. Of course, you had some smokers. What were

04:51.899 --> 04:53.121
the favorite brands? Lucky Strike, you know, and 
then Lucky Strike goes to... Lucky Strike Green.

05:01.431 --> 05:04.435
Lucky Strike Green goes to war, something like 
that. Chesterfield, I guess, as I faintly recall.

05:11.725 --> 05:14.348
But, you know, we didn't have any kind of... That 
was the extent of it. Indulgence would be tobacco

05:17.509 --> 05:20.291
and alcohol. I don't think I ever know of anything 
else besides that. Did you hear of anybody going to

05:25.696 --> 05:29.380
the chicken ranch in LaGrange? Did you know it 
existed? We knew it existed, but I think the recent

05:32.743 --> 05:44.453
story about the Junction Boys put it more on the map 
than it was because they had a local establishment

05:45.260 --> 05:53.856
closer than the chicken ranch, it was over here at 
Brenham.

05:54.136 --> 05:55.899
I had never heard of that. Now, I have never heard 
any mention of a bootlegger in Brazos County that

05:56.400 --> 06:07.200
is a place to buy illegal whiskey. No, I don't know 
of any. Come to think of it, I don't know if we had

06:15.593 --> 06:20.061
any. I'm not heard of them. Well, wait a minute now. 
Let's just say probably some of these guys could

06:23.086 --> 06:33.525
have gone to what we called at that time North 
Bryan. and might have been able to obtain

06:34.973 --> 06:39.379
something. I don't think it was a habit. And I've 
not heard of anyone mention a house of ill repute in

06:42.043 --> 06:46.409
Bryan College Station. No, not in those times. The 
only one that I recall or heard about was the one at

06:50.075 --> 06:54.982
Brenham. After World War II, near the end of it, I 
heard of some rumors about activities on the other

07:04.825 --> 07:11.815
side of the Brazos River Bridge just beyond the air 
base. that there were two or three places apparent

07:11.896 --> 07:40.266
but that was not for a case that was for for the air 
base that uh... a little bit gambling and goodness

07:11.896 --> 07:40.266
knows what else in the background well uh... it 
could have been could have been uh... back to uh...

07:11.896 --> 07:40.266
backed a m uh... silver caps was that a reality 
during your days earlier do you remember it was it

07:11.896 --> 07:40.266
was it was very special and it was all different 
uh... key than it is today. It was done at academic,

07:46.017 --> 07:55.639
and lights were off, and it wasn't publicized 
Anything like that. It was usually on an

07:57.127 --> 08:00.152
individual basis. Did everyone take it 
seriously? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. And it was quite

08:05.001 --> 08:09.489
an occasion. But, you know, it's just like, well, 
we go back to the muster and all, you see. They do so

08:16.262 --> 08:20.209
much about that now. Midnight yell practice that 
was good in the old days because it was unscheduled

08:22.062 --> 08:50.770
It would came at a time that the yell leader thought 
that we needed to boost the team a little bit and All

08:22.062 --> 08:50.770
of a sudden it would happen There was a lot of toilet 
paper thrown And it wasn't scheduled before every

08:22.062 --> 08:50.770
home game did it occur in the stadium in No, sir. It 
occurred usually when Yale practice was on the

08:51.679 --> 08:56.511
steps of the YMCA. That's what I thought. And then 
later moved to the steps of Goodwin Hall. But of

09:02.165 --> 09:07.257
course, it wasn't a production.

09:10.342 --> 09:21.350
As you were preparing to leave for graduation,

09:10.342 --> 09:21.350
what did you and your classmates, what were you all 
talking about? I think I can guess. We were really

09:27.841 --> 09:39.215
concerned about what was going to happen to us as 
far as whether we were going to be enlisted or

09:27.841 --> 09:39.215
whether we were going to be sent

09:27.841 --> 09:39.215
to officer candidate school. And as I recall, we 
went to Houston and were inducted as enlisted men

09:39.855 --> 09:52.110
in the reserve and then called to active duty and we 
all then went to, well, not everybody, but most of

09:52.310 --> 10:01.858
us went to Fort Sam Houston and were inducted. And 
this was a little unusual. Before you could go to

10:04.420 --> 10:10.485
OCS,

10:04.420 --> 10:10.485
you had to be a corporal. So here we were reporting 
in as privates and then in a week being promoted to

10:12.027 --> 10:21.675
corporal, sent to OCS. While the rest of the guys 
when we got to OCS were sergeants and corporals for

10:25.826 --> 10:32.517
more months than we were.

10:36.043 --> 10:37.526
When did you get your Aggie ring? Do you remember?

10:47.440 --> 10:49.002
You have to have so many hours. What was it, 100 or 90 
hours? That's what it used to be. 90 hours, I think,

10:52.767 --> 10:55.010
something like that. And you brought it through 
the registrar. Remember what it cost? $23.75,

10:59.276 --> 11:01.739
something like that. Do you have any special Aggie 
Ring stories to share? Where you lost it or

11:08.308 --> 11:15.878
somebody recognized it when you walked into a 
certain building or something or other?

11:19.064 --> 11:22.869
No, I really don't, but it's recognized all over. 
Is that your original? That's my original, pretty

11:26.455 --> 11:28.718
well worn.

11:32.543 --> 11:39.353
When you left to go to World War II, how well 
prepared and trained did you and your colleagues

11:32.543 --> 11:39.353
think you were? We thought we were ready, you know, 
actually. But the little daily exercise that was

11:42.638 --> 11:48.987
part of our routine on our senior year really 
didn't. prepare you, because we didn't know what

11:49.642 --> 11:52.707
the armor was like. But we soon found out.

11:58.878 --> 12:03.366
We're getting near the end of the questions that I 
had thought about. Can you think of any important

12:04.808 --> 12:12.021
omissions so far, some special things you wanted 
to be sure to include? I won't probably think about

12:13.891 --> 12:17.375
that until after you've gone. Okay. But there's so 
many things that you just can't recall.

12:26.887 --> 12:27.488
Oh, yes. What are the key ingredients of Aggie 
spirit? What creates that feeling?

12:38.902 --> 12:42.767
Well, I think it's association with... men and 
women now that you have so much in common

12:45.025 --> 13:05.567
and you live it and you go away and you still live it 
and you're just a part of it. It's really Of course,

13:06.845 --> 13:20.827
under the new logo they've got for the former 
Students Association, the ring is the thing, but

13:06.845 --> 13:20.827
that's just representative of what it's all. 
They've had so many, and they go through, I think,

13:22.290 --> 13:33.848
at A&M a lot of, and it's on a different scale, but 
when I was in A&M, you had so many

13:37.557 --> 13:55.515
associations, though however small, they were 
all based on the common contact that you had and the

13:37.557 --> 13:55.515
goal that you had to finish and be some kind of a 
citizen, you see. Am I correct that for you and your

13:56.238 --> 14:12.711
contemporaries, it didn't matter very much about 
how much family income that youngster had in his

13:56.238 --> 14:12.711
background, what his hometown was? It's what he 
did when he got here and how he reacted thereafter.

14:21.944 --> 14:33.137
And to me, there were and hopefully still are a 
series of activities that were inclusive in

14:21.944 --> 14:33.137
nature of Aggies instead of being exclusive. 
That's right. That's a good way to say it. Once an

14:38.304 --> 14:41.888
A&M man, always... That's what makes it.

14:48.044 --> 15:00.495
The, for example, when you were a student, I'm 
assuming that it didn't, that you had some

14:48.044 --> 15:00.495
acquaintances who were Hispanic, who were 
Jewish, who were Catholic, who were Protestant.

15:05.239 --> 15:12.465
Yes, and maybe I ought not to make a record of this, 
but you know, When I was going to A&M, we had no

15:12.732 --> 15:18.546
blacks.

15:18.566 --> 15:24.480
That was an old saying, you know, where the Prairie 
View students picked up an Aggie, or they had

15:25.304 --> 15:32.675
something in Canada, and they ended up, they said, 
well, us Aggies has got to stick together. But I

15:33.977 --> 15:43.332
don't, we didn't, you took the guy as he came from 
whatever source. I went to high school in Orange.

15:47.292 --> 15:50.699
And I heard about the Kishi boys that came to A&M. 
Were any of the Kishi boys here when you were here?

15:54.126 --> 15:54.928
They were Japanese? Japanese? Mm-hmm.

15:59.257 --> 16:00.520
No, I don't think so. But were they 
horticulturalists? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Their

16:08.183 --> 16:20.343
family had been, originally they were rice 
farmers that came early in the century, and so they

16:08.183 --> 16:20.343
were second generation American, and all fought 
in Europe. I don't remember that family. The

16:24.089 --> 16:27.795
biggest family that I can recall of A&M students 
from Beaumont, the Kokinos. Yes. Mike was in my

16:34.304 --> 16:37.447
class. Let me record an anecdote about the Kokinos 
brothers. I was speaking over there to the

16:41.772 --> 16:53.985
Beaumont A&M Club, noted for their enthusiasm and 
their loyalty, and the president was mentioning,

16:41.772 --> 16:53.985
this is when women were just here, And the 
president mentioned and reminded the group that

16:53.965 --> 17:05.483
his wife, after World War II, had been a summer 
school student here for three summers, and she had

16:53.965 --> 17:05.483
earned 18 hours. And he got a great laugh by 
repeating what she had said. She said, I only got 18

17:10.791 --> 17:17.862
hours of credit, but I have more grade points than 
all the Kokonos brothers combined. And the

17:19.465 --> 17:21.508
Beaumont audience chuckled. And then he added, 
but I remember a reporter asking their father how

17:22.754 --> 17:37.033
he felt about having, and I think it was six sons on 
active duty. And he said, I feel very proud, and I

17:38.583 --> 17:46.822
wish I had six more sons so that they, too, could 
serve this country. They're a famous family. Oh,

17:49.709 --> 17:50.431
my, yes. Let's see. Next to last question. Let's 
make believe that someone gives you a check for $1

17:54.260 --> 18:10.788
million, and there's only one requirement with 
the gift, that you pass that million dollars on to

17:54.260 --> 18:10.788
Texas A&M, but you can decide what use would be made 
for the money. If you had a million dollars to give

18:11.309 --> 18:16.198
to Texas A&M, what would you want them to do with it? 
What would be your favorite purpose?

18:23.588 --> 18:41.510
Well,

18:23.588 --> 18:41.510
in some way, I would want it to go to the individuals 
who attend or want to attend. That would be

18:42.171 --> 18:45.194
scholarships for students.

18:47.677 --> 18:51.402
And then at the same level, you would want it for not 
scholarships now, but for the

18:52.934 --> 19:10.532
academic

18:52.934 --> 19:10.532
leaders to influence the students in the ways. 
Buildings, fees can build buildings,

19:10.732 --> 19:20.061
but you've got to put it into the person. And it 
would depend upon which side needs the greater

19:23.123 --> 19:27.388
emphasis. And I imagine that A&M,

19:29.151 --> 19:50.818
they have a lot of scholarship, but probably it 
should come from, I mean to, and I guess they are too

19:29.151 --> 19:50.818
doing that, would be provide teaching

19:29.151 --> 19:50.818
chairs,

19:53.802 --> 19:54.643
Last question. Last question. What feelings do 
you hold in your heart now for Texas A&M? Well, I

20:01.350 --> 20:20.350
think it's the same that every A&M graduate has, 
that

20:01.350 --> 20:20.350
it's probably the only school in the country that 
really means something. and that you try to repay

20:21.106 --> 20:28.173
and you never forget the training you had. I 
believe that my academic model, my completed one,

20:28.233 --> 20:50.674
is very broad, but I don't doubt that the training, 
the education that I got at A&M was the basis for

20:28.233 --> 20:50.674
what I've been able to produce since. Let's quit 
there.
