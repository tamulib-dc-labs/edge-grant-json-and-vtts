WEBVTT

00:00.638 --> 00:07.907
University of North Texas and Texas A&M has 
reached out a lot. Now, UT has a center that does a

00:07.927 --> 00:13.414
lot of research, and they're going out and working 
with schools and those kind of things. I don't

00:13.434 --> 00:20.903
think that they've really had that serious 
commitment, and I think they've probably missed

00:13.434 --> 00:20.903
the opportunity as well. See, we've got too many 
doctors.

00:25.748 --> 00:51.604
I'm

00:25.748 --> 00:51.604
sorry

00:25.748 --> 00:51.604
they

00:25.748 --> 00:51.604
don't have the academic courses to really make the 
intellectual, academic side of the doctoral

00:52.192 --> 00:56.698
program what it ought to be. But they're more 
field-based, perhaps.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.199
I'd recommend four, probably. Four. Now, the 
fourth one may be a combination, say, that may be

01:12.921 --> 01:21.253
partially online, that may be really for the 
practitioner, It could be a combination,

01:21.503 --> 01:25.447
perhaps, of Stephen Foster, Sam Houston State. 
And I would like to see a systems doctor at Texas A&M

01:25.908 --> 01:30.273
University, a systems doctor. And I would 
recommend the same thing to the University of

01:30.293 --> 01:33.857
Texas system. Have a systems doctor so that 
they're related to the affiliated institution.

01:38.522 --> 01:46.431
You know, we talk about not having enough academic 
courses, but probably each one of those

01:38.522 --> 01:46.431
institutions has one or two people who are as good 
as the ones at Texas A&M University. So if you

01:46.630 --> 02:01.438
really could do some imaginative work, and I 
talked about this earlier with our former

01:46.630 --> 02:01.438
chancellor, who has a PhD in education, I think, 
about assistance doctrine, and it did make some of

01:46.630 --> 02:01.438
my colleagues very happy. I organized a meeting 
with all professors in the A&M system in Austin

02:01.458 --> 02:09.533
about three years ago, and we proposed the idea 
there, and it wasn't very popular because Oh, he

02:10.508 --> 02:12.832
thought he was super, I guess. Barry Thompson? Oh, 
yeah. And Bill Reed does as well. But it was just

02:19.503 --> 02:25.794
that idea that we're taking the scholarship away 
from the institutions when in fact we wouldn't be.

02:25.854 --> 02:31.403
We would have the making accessible and the 
assisting doctors, and they would have the best of

02:25.854 --> 02:31.403
the best. from each institution and also be able to 
provide very rich internship mentoring programs

02:31.788 --> 02:44.102
for young superintendents and principals doing 
that. That may not come about.

02:56.537 --> 02:57.458
I think one of the big A couple

02:57.758 --> 03:16.167
of us really had a great idea, I thought, to have a 
course on the history development of American

02:57.758 --> 03:16.167
education as being a cornerstone to the strength 
of America. And having a course that was really

03:16.187 --> 03:24.880
interdisciplinary taught by some of the really 
exciting teachers on campus and have that

03:16.187 --> 03:24.880
centered in the College of Education

03:30.209 --> 03:34.154
And it's absolutely critical to the future of our 
country. Well, I put together some ideas. Jack

03:35.395 --> 03:41.103
Campbell, who was in philosophy at that time, and a 
couple others were excited about it. But you know,

03:41.123 --> 03:45.268
when we got right down to it, the College of 
Education said, who's going to teach? Where are

03:45.288 --> 03:46.750
the resources? If we get it passed, what are we 
going to do about it? And then, of course, there was

03:49.453 --> 03:51.996
some of the other friction. I believe we have to 
force them to have education as a discipline,

03:52.016 --> 03:57.263
taught. And that was a missed opportunity. I 
really believe it. Most students who go into

04:00.550 --> 04:19.439
engineering or even liberal arts or whatever have 
no clue about the structure of American

04:00.550 --> 04:19.439
education, how it's funded, and how

04:00.550 --> 04:19.439
important it is to our society. Almost 95% of them. 
So that was a missed opportunity. And that was just

04:23.966 --> 04:25.849
another dream I had, I guess.

04:32.157 --> 04:45.693
The first women I remember were taking courses in 
summer before women were admitted to the

04:32.157 --> 04:45.693
institution. But when I was working on my PhD, I was 
almost finished in 67. And in fact, I was going

04:51.500 --> 04:53.482
through some stuff. And we were spelling mother 
and dad's house the other day and parceling out

04:53.502 --> 04:57.567
things. I found a memo signed by Haskell Monroe. 
approving my acceptance of candidacy, providing

05:00.490 --> 05:09.088
I take another course or two or finish my 
dissertation, those kinds of things. At that

05:09.429 --> 05:16.123
time, I remember the first woman coming into the 
graduate program, and that would have been about

05:09.429 --> 05:16.123
1967. Prior to that, I can't remember a woman in the 
graduate program When we went from the Department

05:23.137 --> 05:35.313
of Education and Psychology in the College of 
Liberal Arts to the College of Education in 1969,

05:23.137 --> 05:35.313
then women started coming in in smaller numbers. 
So out of the first 50 doctors, I guess I'd have to

05:35.333 --> 05:39.339
look across that list. I'd say probably six of 
them, seven of them are women.

05:47.750 --> 05:51.355
I really don't, but there were so few of them. It was 
difficult to say. I remember one woman named Blum

05:54.978 --> 06:07.455
was a very bright, very good student, and I 
remember she blended in very well with most of the

05:54.978 --> 06:07.455
males. And now, of course, about half of our 
students in administration are women. And now

06:13.904 --> 06:19.452
that we've combined the Department of 
Administration and Human Resource Development,

06:13.904 --> 06:19.452
it may be 60%.

06:22.807 --> 06:40.271
Well, there was, in terms of looking at the first 
women on this faculty in administration, they had

06:22.807 --> 06:40.271
women in teacher education faculty before 
administration faculty. I'm trying to think who

06:41.052 --> 06:51.025
the first woman would have been, unless it's 
probably the model agent, perhaps, about...

06:53.755 --> 06:58.262
about seven or eight years ago, I guess. And I can't 
remember a woman faculty, and I can remember

06:58.282 --> 07:05.413
adjuncts, so people coming in to teach courses, 
but full-time, I think, Dr. Lincoln. Now we have

07:05.954 --> 07:13.425
two

07:05.954 --> 07:13.425
African-American women. We have

07:13.445 --> 07:19.915
two, three women. three Anglo women, and that's 
out of a full-time faculty of about 10 people. So we

07:33.280 --> 07:41.572
really made some difference there in terms of 
color and gender in our department. I feel really

07:41.592 --> 07:43.455
good about that, and I think all of us do.

07:59.281 --> 08:04.266
It's been like the nation in terms of staffing 
schools. I think the men dominate the secondary

08:04.286 --> 08:10.772
level in the principalships, and the women. 
There's far more men teaching secondary level and

08:10.792 --> 08:15.356
junior high level than you find at the elementary 
level. Most of the principals at the elementary

08:15.376 --> 08:19.540
level are women, when 40 years ago they were men. So 
women are coming in through the elementary level,

08:20.261 --> 08:28.849
taking assistant superintendents, and then 
become superintendents, because even though the

08:20.261 --> 08:28.849
secondary principal is the gateway to the 
superintendency. Most of those positions still

08:31.655 --> 08:45.538
held by men, but since there's a great concern now 
about who's going to fill those apprenticeships,

08:31.655 --> 08:45.538
we know some of our women are doing a great job, and 
just as tough as the guys, and many times

08:31.655 --> 08:45.538
understand curriculum better than the guys 
because we've been at the elementary level. Now,

08:46.339 --> 08:56.035
in terms of the accountability issues in the 
state, us in North Carolina are considered to have

08:46.339 --> 08:56.035
the best accountability system in the nation. 
Because of our concern, I guess, going back to

08:56.588 --> 09:18.002
early legislation in the 1980s, when Governor 
White was here,

08:56.588 --> 09:18.002
we started right then with testing, with tabs, 
teams, to toss tests. And so where we've made great

09:18.022 --> 09:23.170
strides, I think, in terms of student 
achievement, We also make great strides with

09:23.673 --> 09:28.660
numbers of kids taking ACP and SAT. We have 53% of 
Texans now taking the ACP, SAT. When 15 years ago,

09:32.505 --> 09:35.429
there might have been 30% taking it. And as you well 
know, as a college president and professor, the

09:35.449 --> 09:46.724
more people taking the SAT, ACP, you've got a 
pretty good chance of the grades leveling off or

09:35.449 --> 09:46.724
certainly even dipping.

09:50.249 --> 09:50.389
Mm-hmm. Well, there's no question about it. I 
think that his vision for education and the kinds

09:53.799 --> 10:07.443
of legislation that came about during this time 
set the stage for improving schools. We had a real

10:07.463 --> 10:17.760
problem, I think, when the parole commission came 
along about seven or eight years ago that Dean

10:07.463 --> 10:17.760
Torrigan served on. Corrigan was the only bright 
light on that committee, and they removed

10:18.179 --> 10:27.269
education and discipline from the colleges, 
thinking that there was no academic content

10:18.179 --> 10:27.269
there. And now we have a real problem preparing 
teachers with a few numbers of education. That's

10:32.836 --> 10:34.377
another missed opportunity. I think we have this 
university and other universities fighting that

10:34.397 --> 10:42.887
kind of mentality that all teaching is 
content-driven. And Corrigan was the only bright

10:43.643 --> 10:47.547
light, but we lost that battle. And so it's been 
difficult. We can't major in the health and

10:49.409 --> 10:51.971
kinesiology here. I mean, we can't major in the 
physical education here. Major in any major in

10:54.313 --> 10:57.817
health and kinesiology or interdisciplinary 
studies. Now, at the graduate level, you can,

10:58.357 --> 11:01.741
education administration. So that was a missed 
opportunity, I think, in

11:02.021 --> 11:07.066
the state. I think probably, I can't remember I 
know some of them at that time were out in Bowen,

11:13.478 --> 11:21.689
head of the State Board of Education. I'm trying to 
think of his name. He's been deceased for a while.

11:28.999 --> 11:31.662
Frank Hubert, they were advising. So we had some 
really solid people advising White, but I think he

11:32.303 --> 11:38.271
said,

11:42.588 --> 11:48.436
that were not bright lights, or as they say, not the 
sharpest knife in the door. And where Bush has come

11:48.456 --> 12:00.814
on, and George Bush has come on and gotten a lot of 
credit, to his credit, he did appoint a top person

11:48.456 --> 12:00.814
for the Commission of Education, Mike Moses, 
who's now 11th. And he had put the right things in

12:00.874 --> 12:11.970
motion with the governor's support to really help 
the governor, I think, get the name, get at least

12:00.874 --> 12:11.970
the brand of being an education governor. And I 
want to give him some credit for that. But he knew

12:15.169 --> 12:17.751
how to appoint the right person to get things 
going. And now he's appointed Jim Nelson, who's

12:17.771 --> 12:22.816
his friend, a lawyer, and he's doing a good job. But 
obviously he doesn't have the respect that the

12:23.296 --> 12:30.463
superintendent gave to Mike Moses. And I've got 
November I'll have Jim Nelson coming here for the

12:30.483 --> 12:36.849
second year in a row through our conference with 
the superintendent. He's gaining more favor

12:36.869 --> 12:40.472
because he's real positive about things.

12:48.653 --> 12:54.898
Uh-huh.

12:54.918 --> 12:56.160
Not particularly. Certainly Connolly, White, 
and I think Bush as well.

13:06.188 --> 13:17.158
Oh, I think probably our

13:06.188 --> 13:17.158
SMU, Bill Clements. would get a low mark, even 
though he kind of took the governorship. Smith, I

13:23.843 --> 13:28.730
think, low mark. Because they just didn't have a 
vision for education.

13:42.330 --> 13:42.690
Yeah. Started here, it was really tough. I was 
recruited to come here. I really didn't apply

13:48.439 --> 13:50.161
officially. And the opportunity to come back 
home, and the first thing out of the bat, I wound up

13:50.461 --> 14:06.718
with a very huge U.S. Department of Education 
grant that Jim McNamara had authored. But I wound

14:06.738 --> 14:10.221
up being an essential investigator on it the first 
year. I wound up also planning... the

14:12.539 --> 14:18.489
Administrative Leadership Institute, teaching 
full class load, and took on several doctoral

14:12.539 --> 14:18.489
students immediately. And it was pretty heavy.

14:23.357 --> 14:31.049
Then, as time went on, I was able to, I think, get 
myself a little more organized. But as I did that, I

14:31.670 --> 14:34.855
became more and more involved at the national 
level. Early 80s, I spent time watching BC away

14:35.516 --> 14:38.361
from campus. We took a sabbatical and was in Europe 
in 85-86 to try to ease the pain. In 1985, I'd been

14:45.138 --> 14:51.709
here about 10 years, and I was exhausted. I mean, 
I'd lost my zeal for teaching. I had an opportunity

14:55.435 --> 14:57.859
to go to the University of Virginia. They wanted me 
to come. They had a chair there. They were

14:59.322 --> 15:01.766
interested in me taking it. And... And all of a 
sudden, Boston University called. I had talked to

15:05.903 --> 15:08.005
them one summer. I called a global workshop in the 
Mediterranean for them. And they called and said,

15:12.130 --> 15:19.638
we would like you to go to Europe for a year for us and 
be our guest professor. And that was a godsend. I

15:23.603 --> 15:24.784
left for a full year. They covered me here. Boston 
picked up all my benefits and salaries. When I got

15:32.172 --> 15:36.717
back from that, my whole life took on a different 
meaning. I was more excited, more intellectually

15:36.737 --> 15:40.821
challenged. And that's when I started, I think, 
really becoming more productive as a writer, as a

15:40.841 --> 15:46.727
speaker, as a teacher. And since that time, I've 
been involved with the study abroad program, so I

15:47.628 --> 15:55.236
can go to Europe occasionally and get abroad when I 
get so steamed. Because I'm either writing on a

15:55.256 --> 16:01.403
book or doing research papers or speaking. My life 
has changed in terms of when I wrote this little

16:02.227 --> 16:07.554
book on the study of the future.

16:11.078 --> 16:14.362
This was a 1995 publication. All of a sudden, my 
speaking opportunities became much, much

16:14.382 --> 16:22.753
greater, at least assignments. And I think the 
more and more I taught and the more I spoke and the

16:23.013 --> 16:30.883
more I wrote, the more my life has become much 
busier. But I've learned to deal with it better.

16:33.357 --> 16:37.300
I'm doing too much all the time, but I've learned to 
deal with it better. I'm not happy unless I'm just

16:37.340 --> 16:42.805
hell-mell now into writing and speaking and those 
kind of things. So I moved very quickly from full

16:42.865 --> 16:53.794
professorship, and then a couple of times people 
talked with me about taking deanship, but I just

16:42.865 --> 16:53.794
didn't leave. And now most of the things I do I 
really enjoy doing, even though I've taken on too

16:53.814 --> 17:00.280
many assignments. here and across the nation. But 
thank God for that year in Europe. And we don't have

17:05.657 --> 17:08.062
enough sabbaticals at this university. We have 
developmental leave now, more opportunities

17:08.763 --> 17:12.690
maybe in our department than we've ever had. And 
that's a good sign. But I served on the

17:15.696 --> 17:21.627
developmental leave committee here several 
years. And you had to absolutely snow everybody.

17:24.817 --> 17:26.498
You had to have the most brilliant thing. You had 
all these caveats. You couldn't be writing a book.

17:29.021 --> 17:29.622
You couldn't do this. You couldn't do that. You had 
to actually be going. If you're going somewhere,

17:32.565 --> 17:35.828
you couldn't be going somewhere to write a book. 
That was not academic. And so it was almost tough to

17:38.230 --> 17:40.232
get us back. It was almost impossible around here. 
Now the opportunity has come. I had to make my own

17:44.397 --> 17:47.800
break to go to Washington for four months. And I 
worked with Dr. Corrigan. He told me to write a

17:50.817 --> 17:55.242
draft on how I could cover myself while I was gone. 
He helped me do that. The year in Europe, they hired

17:57.185 --> 18:00.389
somebody to teach my classes. But I had to lay it out 
and show them how we could do that. This college was

18:03.273 --> 18:06.336
not used to anybody taking developmental leave. 
And I think, truly, I was one of the first people to

18:07.117 --> 18:11.543
say, I've got to get out of here. I've got to repress 
because I'm involved in too many things.

18:14.965 --> 18:24.033
Speaking, writing, teaching, committees on 
campus, athletic council, church work, board

18:14.965 --> 18:24.033
presence, the kind of things that busy, crazy 
people do. So thank God for that sabbatical, and

18:24.794 --> 18:35.564
then the study abroad and the European 
experiences here have really helped me.

18:35.925 --> 18:37.306
I've been pretty fortunate there. I've talked 
about... four, maybe five courses since I've been

18:41.307 --> 18:44.532
here. Three of them I have taught, the same three I 
have taught for the last 10 years. I'm teaching the

18:50.260 --> 19:00.775
course called The Nature and Problems of 
Administrative Behavior, which is our top

18:50.260 --> 19:00.775
doctoral leadership organizational dynamics 
behavior course. I'm teaching a course on program

19:00.795 --> 19:09.508
evaluation, which is now, I have adopted it to the 
state academic indicator system,

19:09.674 --> 19:27.632
accountability system, so that we go online and 
really look at data of all the school systems to see

19:09.674 --> 19:27.632
how well they're doing on the top stats, on 
attendance, the criteria to determine whether

19:09.674 --> 19:27.632
you're exemplary, recognized, acceptable, or 
not. I'll have to change the shift there, but

19:27.652 --> 19:34.078
that's a great course primarily for K-12 teachers 
who want to be a part of this. The third course is the

19:34.338 --> 19:39.343
Educational Planning Futurism course, which I 
brought here in 75, and it is truly an

19:39.762 --> 19:45.089
interdisciplinary course. I taught it 
yesterday. I've got students in engineering,

19:45.970 --> 19:52.939
business, and education, and that's an exciting 
course because we look at broad futures.

19:52.959 --> 20:03.253
Education is only part of that, but those are three 
courses that I really, really, really treasure.

20:03.273 --> 20:03.373
Okay? All right, the first course, the 
administrative behavior courses, are primarily

20:04.400 --> 20:19.433
our PhD students who are, they take that, try to 
take that during the earliest part of their

20:04.400 --> 20:19.433
doctoral program because it is the, and I think my 
colleagues will agree, it's the heartbeat of our

20:04.400 --> 20:19.433
discipline. It is the terminology, it is the 
theory of basics, where we come from. and how we're

20:23.317 --> 20:36.751
trying to develop more of a respect in terms of our 
research and our development arm there, in terms

20:23.317 --> 20:36.751
of who we are as an organization, drawing on all 
kinds of organizational theory and literature.

20:36.771 --> 20:52.547
Next course, the program evaluation class, 
mostly master students who are principals, who

20:36.771 --> 20:52.547
are working for a principal certification, or who 
are classroom teachers, who want to understand

20:36.771 --> 20:52.547
accountability, because I spend a lot of time on 
teacher groups, teaching cycles, how to evaluate

20:36.771 --> 20:52.547
students, And in the third course, I've got two 
entrepreneurs in there who are not working on

20:53.287 --> 21:02.920
PhDs, who've been in the business world. I've got a 
retired professor from mechanical engineering

21:02.940 --> 21:10.570
who's just sitting in on the class. I've got seven 
or eight in ag development, international

21:10.590 --> 21:14.315
development. I've got an educational 
psychologist. I've got about 12. five or six, I

21:20.472 --> 21:25.458
guess, who are in higher education one way or 
another. Most of them are at the doctoral level.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.648
Some are at

21:27.000 --> 21:32.648
the master's level. Yes, in the theory class, they 
have two exams. I guess my midterm exam is known as

21:36.673 --> 21:43.662
the, it's the most feared exam in this department 
from all I can hear. But all it is, I just make sure

21:44.249 --> 21:53.098
they know the terminology, know the literature, 
they know the names, they know the systems thought

21:44.249 --> 21:53.098
that's come over the years. And then they have a 
final exam in that course. They have a term paper on

21:55.921 --> 21:59.946
some theories and or theory. They have critiques. 
They must read and turn in critiques that are

22:01.527 --> 22:07.894
readings that are found in the syllabus or 
elsewhere that's tied to that direct topic.

22:10.921 --> 22:16.287
They've got to have something read and turned in 
before we start a new topic. Then they're assigned

22:16.788 --> 22:22.254
a consistent professorship, where they actually 
draw on the hat and pull out a reading. And if they

22:22.274 --> 22:25.257
don't understand what that person's written, you 
have to call them, get in touch with them. They've

22:25.277 --> 22:26.499
got to share with me. Tonight I'm talking about 
leadership for him. They've got to talk about

22:29.282 --> 22:35.569
what, say, Harlan Cleveland might have talked 
about, what he might have said. The other class,

22:36.410 --> 22:41.196
the program evaluations class, I put them in 
groups of four. They, then, can select any school

22:42.237 --> 22:45.721
system in the state of Texas. They've got to, I 
mean, they've got to look at, they've got to go

22:45.741 --> 23:03.924
online, they've got to get a tremendous 
understanding of that school district in terms of

22:45.741 --> 23:03.924
its wealth, its demographics, its test scores, 
its dropouts, its faculty, how well educated they

22:45.741 --> 23:03.924
are, superintendent, how long they've been 
there, board members, everything about them. And

23:03.944 --> 23:04.965
they've got to report. Why do they think that 
district's doing better than it should, or why

23:05.722 --> 23:11.107
it's not doing as well as it should? And then each of 
those committee members have to do one of the

23:11.127 --> 23:15.791
campuses and describe it very well. My goal is 
they've got to know more about accountability

23:16.472 --> 23:24.559
when they go back at the end of that course and their 
principal, or after superintendent. Third

23:24.579 --> 23:27.562
course, the future class, and it's exciting. I put 
them into teams of, I've got 22 students. I've got

23:31.786 --> 23:32.927
teams of five. They've got to create a community. 
through the year 2020, like Hoyleville there,

23:35.354 --> 23:41.643
city limits population 50,000, and they'll 
present that. I have been Don Sweeney from Urban

23:42.204 --> 23:58.206
Planning, and they've got to present a city 
through the year 2020 that has everything, their

23:42.204 --> 23:58.206
food, their transportation, their medicine, 
their religious centers, their recreation, all

23:42.204 --> 23:58.206
about that. and explained to us, and they win a 
prize. That one team that wins gets a prize, and the

24:01.808 --> 24:05.393
prizes are made in my garage. I won't tell you what 
they are, because it's a fantastic prize. They

24:09.559 --> 24:11.342
look terrible, but the kids love them. The 
students love them. Then the other project, each

24:12.704 --> 24:17.010
of them has to write a personal scenario. Ten years 
in future. They can't be failures. They've got to

24:19.714 --> 24:21.196
be successful. They've got to say what they're 
doing, how well they're doing it, how they're

24:21.216 --> 24:27.045
getting to where they're doing it, how they're 
using information. And they've got to tell us how

24:27.312 --> 24:31.136
they got there from this point. And those are the 
major assignments in the future class. And it's

24:33.678 --> 24:44.008
really, I run into people all the time 15 years 
later that reach in their pocket and pull out a

24:33.678 --> 24:44.008
little clear marble that I've given them in this 
class. I've done it for 20 years. And they've got to

24:46.550 --> 24:48.172
carry that everywhere they go. Because I say, once 
you run into problems in your life, I want you to

24:48.472 --> 24:56.560
think about what you've learned, use the good 
intellect you have, Put the crows and toms down on

24:57.232 --> 24:59.374
your decision. Get that little crystal ball out. 
Look into it and make your decision. And that's

25:03.778 --> 25:10.103
been a real joy, a labor of love, that class over the 
years to see what's happened to people. Because

25:10.123 --> 25:16.869
every once in a while, Kay and you or someone will 
say, what's your track record in terms of people

25:10.123 --> 25:16.869
writing scenarios? I said, it's scary. It's 
phenomenal how they follow those scenarios.

25:23.115 --> 25:25.517
Because it's the first time in most of their 
careers They've never had to write down specific

25:25.801 --> 25:29.468
goals of where they're going in their life. So 
those are the three things.

25:37.142 --> 25:40.828
Most of them are out in the real world or are working 
on this campus. Now, some of them come right out of

25:40.849 --> 25:43.113
the bachelor's into the master's. We discourage 
that unless they're going into student affairs

25:43.133 --> 25:46.639
work. So I'll have some SAHI or student affairs 
people send.

25:55.703 --> 26:02.973
Generally they're from Texas, but we are now more 
and more getting people coming in from out of state

25:55.703 --> 26:02.973
for our program. We have built kind of a reputation 
through our department. We've got some obviously

26:08.901 --> 26:16.932
internationally known people in our department, 
so we're beginning to attract people from out of

26:08.901 --> 26:16.932
state.

26:17.232 --> 26:22.960
We occasionally will attract one or two from 
Taiwan. Often we've had two from Russia who come

26:23.615 --> 26:31.530
here, and so we're beginning more and more to see. 
And we have Chinese visiting scholars, and we've

26:32.191 --> 26:38.382
had two or three students from China in the last two 
or three years. So that's beginning to happen more

26:39.104 --> 26:41.648
and more. Not many from Mexico, even though we have 
an agreement to know.

26:55.559 --> 26:59.464
I don't think they're any more rigorous. I think 
probably the creative

26:59.484 --> 27:09.536
side of it is probably stressed more in terms of 
thinking out of the box and thinking about what

26:59.484 --> 27:09.536
could be. Because I can remember the early PhD 
program, we had eight areas we were responsible

27:10.057 --> 27:15.724
for in education. And we had to try to master all 
eight of those areas in our written exams and

27:16.204 --> 27:21.350
everything else. And in many ways, of course, we 
had to take two languages in. Now we take

27:24.550 --> 27:27.334
statistics and measurements. Perhaps part of 
that was a waste. It was certainly a mental

27:29.898 --> 27:32.002
discipline. But I really believe that the rigor 
really has not changed. The technology has

27:39.113 --> 27:41.316
certainly changed a bit. And I'm experiencing 
that right now with our new APDGN system. And

27:47.205 --> 27:52.954
finding some limitations in that, knowing full 
well that eventually it's going to be a benefit.

28:00.848 --> 28:13.374
I guess it's really close between the 
organizational behavior, especially the

28:00.848 --> 28:13.374
motivation leadership elements, and the futures 
class with the vision element, which is

28:00.848 --> 28:13.374
motivational. So those two courses, I have 
difficulty deciding between those two because I

28:13.394 --> 28:22.232
go into both those classes each night excited, 
pumped up, I try to get well prepared. I tell them

28:23.897 --> 28:27.942
that when they walk into that class, they better be 
ready, because I'm going to be ready. So those two I

28:27.962 --> 28:29.163
really enjoy. The third one, I don't have to really 
ramp up so much, because they go online. The first

28:34.611 --> 28:37.414
two or three nights, we've got to get them set the 
stage. But I think the leadership, motivation,

28:37.434 --> 28:50.952
organizational behavior, and the visioning and 
futuring are my favorite classes.

28:50.972 --> 28:51.072
.

28:54.190 --> 29:04.585
I get here sometime between 8 and 9, depends on the 
day, and stay until 6, 6.30. But often, spring

29:04.725 --> 29:10.153
semester, I have two night classes that go from 5 to 
8. So that's about nine to eight days, usually. And

29:16.462 --> 29:20.468
I work out during the noon hour. I get an hour and a 
half break with the long days. But I guess it's a

29:24.650 --> 29:34.199
rare day that I'm here under seven hours,

29:24.650 --> 29:34.199
most all that time, unless I'm in a doctoral 
committee meeting. And those happen about, on the

29:34.839 --> 29:42.767
average, twice a week during the fall and spring 
semester. I'm chairing probably right now six to

29:42.787 --> 29:50.133
seven dissertations in the writing stage. I chair 
about 31 committees. And I sit on probably about 30

29:52.882 --> 30:01.196
more, and working with five or six master's 
students in their degree. So while I'm not at the

30:01.216 --> 30:08.489
office, I'll probably be watching TV or eat often 
with this patient in my lap. And most of my trips on

30:09.350 --> 30:16.122
the plane, heading for speaking somewhere, I'll 
carry dissertations with me and proposals. And

30:20.069 --> 30:23.012
that helps a lot. Usually when I go give a speech 
somewhere, I grab stuff in my lap and prepare it

30:23.653 --> 30:32.642
in the plane. I'm a jogger, a runner. I go to the rec 
center about five days a week and run and lift.

30:40.670 --> 30:44.153
We've got the good knowledge equipment, those 
kinds of things. I've got a lake home out at Kent

30:44.213 --> 30:46.075
Creek Lake. And that's been the state sort of place 
where we can go and just kind of forget things for a

30:46.679 --> 30:53.047
while. Travel. Carol and I love to travel. And I can 
be in Italy one day and things start drifting away.

31:00.897 --> 31:08.567
After the third day, I forget I'm even a professor 
there, even though I'm teaching undergraduates

31:00.897 --> 31:08.567
over there. So I have to fill those things in 
because it's just relentless, absolutely

31:08.808 --> 31:16.197
relentless in terms of something to do every day.

31:27.230 --> 31:28.867
Yeah. Yeah.
