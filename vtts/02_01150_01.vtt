WEBVTT

00:01.516 --> 00:04.199
College Station, Texas A&M. Would you introduce 
yourself please, tell me your full name and maybe a

00:04.660 --> 00:15.374
little about your very early career and where you 
came from and how you got to Texas A&M. Okay,

00:16.335 --> 00:18.197
William Burch Harris. I was born in Loveland, 
Colorado. which is probably, in my opinion, the

00:24.567 --> 00:27.992
best place in the world to have been born. It's 
right close to the mountains. And my parents were

00:31.137 --> 00:43.895
fairly well aged when I got born, so they sort of let 
me run my own ship, which was kind of a Belgian

00:31.137 --> 00:43.895
outfit. It gave me a lot of free rein to go fishing 
when I felt like it and that sort of thing. It was a

00:50.145 --> 00:51.807
good life. Of course, that was during the 
Depression when the folks had a farm, which they

00:53.660 --> 01:04.151
rented out, which made them, I guess you'd say 
middle class, but still not much money.

01:08.315 --> 01:12.259
The big thing around Lublin in those days was 
farming. Sugar beets? Are you into sugar beets?

01:14.461 --> 01:15.542
Sugar beets, yeah. And at that time, they called 
themselves the cherry capital of the world. They

01:19.466 --> 01:21.608
had many, many cherry orchards. And during the 
summer, for example, all those kids and mothers

01:22.955 --> 01:33.947
and fathers and other people would be picking 
cherries. You could make a lot of money, but in the

01:33.967 --> 01:37.411
Depression, a dollar a day wasn't bad. It's about 
what I could make.

01:43.698 --> 01:52.067
We had a canning plant there in town, which 
processed cherries and peas and beans other

01:53.144 --> 01:55.687
things of that nature. It was the second biggest 
industry in town, the sugar beet factory being the

01:55.707 --> 02:01.874
biggest. Were you kind of on the edge then of 
chemical engineering and didn't know it at the

02:02.014 --> 02:06.399
time? Well, not really.

02:13.186 --> 02:16.390
Not too much chemical engineering in Canyon, I 
guess, for sure. Well, I'm from Louisiana, and I

02:16.410 --> 02:21.295
guess They really recruited chemical engineers 
pretty early into the sugar refining process.

02:26.331 --> 02:27.292
That's right. Most of them had a chemist, they used 
to call them chemists, but it turns out chem

02:27.872 --> 02:41.469
engineers were a little more useful than chemists 
actually, because the chemistry is pretty well

02:27.872 --> 02:41.469
fixed for that business. Actually, in our town, 
the best job in town was probably the manager of the

02:42.811 --> 02:48.618
sugar plant. The next best job was being the 
chemist in the sugar plant. But anyhow, when I was

02:51.937 --> 03:03.630
16, I, Cornswogged a chance to go to work for the 
Cooner Empson Company during the summer, which

02:51.937 --> 03:03.630
meant I didn't have to pick cherries anymore. And I 
got the big sum of 32 cents an hour, which was about

03:03.650 --> 03:09.377
double the normal wage, so that was not bad. No,

03:09.617 --> 03:14.863
that's pretty good. That's K-U-N-E-R. 
K-U-N-E-R. Yeah. Did you ever see that? Oh

03:22.160 --> 03:27.146
yeah. But anyhow, I kind of got in there through the 
back door. I met a guy who was a foreman

03:33.553 --> 03:41.002
and he kind of liked me I guess. He had an extra time 
card he was supposed to be passing out to his old

03:41.022 --> 03:46.428
employees and he slipped one to me. You were hired. 
I was hired. Plant's superintendent came along

03:49.480 --> 03:53.445
about a week later and saw me and said, my God, how 
old are you? I told him 16, and he looked at me a

03:53.485 --> 03:58.812
little bit and finally said, well, bring a letter 
from your parents saying it's okay. So I had a job,

03:59.913 --> 04:04.679
which was, there weren't too many jobs in those 
days. That was a little, I should at least half the

04:04.699 --> 04:09.786
town was unemployed, I guess. A little more than 
that. Anyhow, I worked there, finished up high

04:11.468 --> 04:16.855
school, I decided I'd go to, in high school, 
chemistry was lots of fun. So, that and the fact

04:23.673 --> 04:29.701
that I liked to repair motorcycles and crap like 
that, the instructor told me I ought to be a team

04:23.673 --> 04:29.701
engineer. It sounded all right to me. That's all I 
knew about it. Went to the University of Colorado.

04:42.552 --> 04:45.055
got out after the usual four years. Now, at 
Colorado, was the chemical engineering program

04:45.095 --> 04:49.220
in with chemistry? No, it was a separate 
department, but I later, after I graduated, found

04:49.300 --> 04:58.410
out it was not an accredited college. So, that got 
me into a little trouble later on when I wanted to do

04:59.352 --> 05:11.766
the registry as a professional engineer, because 
I hadn't gotten out of an accredited institution.

05:12.218 --> 05:22.510
But anyhow, worked

05:12.218 --> 05:22.510
my way through college, didn't have any money. 
Actually, the way I did it, I formed a housing

05:22.990 --> 05:38.688
co-op, and we rented an old fraternity house that 
had gone under, hired a housekeeper and cook, and

05:22.990 --> 05:38.688
we were in business. And since I organized it, I got 
three board meetings for being the dishwasher.

05:42.863 --> 05:44.706
You know, that was a big thing here. You've 
probably heard about it, the Kalamata Houses.

05:47.630 --> 05:49.753
Well, it was pretty much in those days. We had a guy, 
a prop sponsor, who by today's standards would be a

05:49.773 --> 05:58.786
full-fledged communist, that he would offer. 
That was the style. That kind of stuff. So it worked

06:02.832 --> 06:04.194
out real well. I had that job. In the summers, of 
course I went back the next year, when I was

06:05.496 --> 06:12.246
seventeen, and worked at the canning company most 
of the summer.

06:21.433 --> 06:32.293
When I was 18 I went back and found out that the 
foreman of the plant was going to quit because he'd

06:21.433 --> 06:32.293
gotten a full-time job up in this part working in 
the diversion of the Big Thompson River. And about

06:34.585 --> 06:40.012
a month before the plant was supposed to start, I 
went and wondered who the heck my boss was going to

06:34.585 --> 06:40.012
be. So I walked down to the plant, caught the plant 
manager walking down the sidewalk in front of the

06:40.092 --> 06:48.203
building and says, hey, I hear Bert's not coming 
back. He says, that's right. So I said, well, do you

06:49.845 --> 06:51.988
have anyone to take his place? And he looked at me 
kind of funny and said, well, he'll consider you.

06:57.656 --> 06:59.098
So I kept my mouth shut. Of course, I had no idea of 
applying for the job, but about a week later, one of

07:00.079 --> 07:04.525
my buddies said, I went down and asked the same 
thing. He wanted to know who his boss was going to

07:07.729 --> 07:09.052
be. The guy said, well, did you work for Bill 
Harris? I guess I could. He said, well, that's the

07:13.338 --> 07:14.520
guy. So he got on his bicycle, rode up, and told me. 
And that's the first time I knew about it. And that

07:21.031 --> 07:23.615
afternoon, I got a call from the plant manager. He 
called me then, asked me if I thought I could handle

07:23.635 --> 07:27.041
it. And I said, well, if I get into trouble, I guess I 
ought to do the same. OK, he said. So, that was a big

07:32.315 --> 07:34.780
job, by the way. That was one of the best jobs in 
town. I bet he went and broke all his buttons off his

07:37.425 --> 07:39.689
chest. What year was that now? That would be 1938. 
37. Maybe 38, I think.

07:54.617 --> 07:55.318
Anyhow, After the first day or two, which were 
absolute hell, everything went fine, and I had a

07:56.902 --> 08:03.011
real good job. Actually, when I graduated and 
decided I'd have to go back east to get a job as a chem

08:03.812 --> 08:13.586
engineer, I told the plant manager, and I actually 
cried because I was leaving. So he kind of liked me.

08:15.629 --> 08:21.919
And it turns out, I think, that I decided I'd been 
better off nationally by staying there and going

08:15.629 --> 08:21.919
back east. But as a chem engineer, I had to do my 
thing. Went back to Buffalo, New York, I got a job

08:26.956 --> 08:33.562
with National Handling Division of Analytic 
Chemical and Dye, which is a company that makes dye

08:26.956 --> 08:33.562
stuff. At that time, most of all the chemistry 
industry involved coal-tar chemistry. I started

08:43.091 --> 08:50.137
out with benzene, naphthalene, built up an entire 
industry from that. It was a very fun job because

08:50.397 --> 08:55.562
everything was batch chemistry. and they ran 
almost every reaction that's known except the

08:55.880 --> 09:01.928
Denard reaction. So I had a lot of opportunity to 
learn a lot about industrial chemistry, although

09:02.028 --> 09:08.697
I was a chem engineer, they considered me a 
chemist. I started there as a production worker,

09:09.618 --> 09:20.493
and I guess I made so many waves telling them how to 
do it this way or that way, they put me over in

09:09.618 --> 09:20.493
research and development. I and one other chem 
engineering BS were the only people in the

09:24.753 --> 09:30.982
research department that didn't have PhDs in 
chemistry, which made us kind of weird. And I

09:31.002 --> 09:44.261
wasn't too hot in chemistry anyhow, so I ended up 
taking the processes that most of the chemists

09:31.002 --> 09:44.261
would develop and working on them and making them a 
practical process for the industry to put out into

09:31.002 --> 09:44.261
the plant. Because they'd do things like 13 ether 
extractions or something like that. We just

09:48.707 --> 09:51.431
totally paused for that. But that's what I came up 
with. Right. And so I worked for the the

09:54.622 --> 10:06.999
intermediates group as their, I guess you'd say, 
liaison between application

09:54.622 --> 10:06.999
and research. It was a great job. The war broke out. 
I got an industrial deferment. I tried to enter the

10:17.174 --> 10:23.042
Navy because we had to get an engine sprang in. got 
that shot down real fast. They needed training in

10:27.647 --> 10:33.693
industrial chemistry. Did Allied Chemical move 
into war production? They did some, but of course

10:38.017 --> 10:43.462
things like Cagney Dye and so forth. Yeah, that's 
right. But really what kind of got going

10:45.324 --> 10:49.188
thereafter, I did a number of things. I worked on 
some war gases, things like that. One thing's not

10:54.123 --> 11:16.640
generally known, we didn't do much fighting over 
in the east for about two years after the war broke

10:54.123 --> 11:16.640
out, because, well, the Japanese had taken over 
Indonesia and these other countries that

10:54.123 --> 11:16.640
produced quinine, and all of them were heavily 
infested with malaria, and it was just

10:54.123 --> 11:16.640
impractical to invade these islands and not have 
any kind of quinine available. And finally the

11:16.660 --> 11:21.227
Americans from North Africa captured some German 
soldiers, and found they were taking a pill that

11:22.051 --> 11:34.808
the vermin had developed as an asymptote for one 
brain, for adrenoplinicrin. They sent the pills

11:34.828 --> 11:42.558
over to us and said we need tons of this stuff as soon 
as possible.

11:44.321 --> 11:47.485
So three of us took on the job of synthesizing that 
and working with the production team. Did Allied

11:48.258 --> 11:51.343
chemical manufacturers start making it? Oh yes, 
they started making it. That was kind of an

11:53.546 --> 11:56.872
interesting thing. It turned out everybody took 
it yellow. Most of the soldiers can remember

12:00.617 --> 12:02.560
taking it. I almost remember that stuff. I didn't 
take it, but I remember people talking about it. I

12:06.507 --> 12:11.194
remember one of the funny things is I walked in and 
we had a polar lab. One of my friends was down there.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.519
I went down to see him and went into the lab where he 
had a black light on. It scared the hell out of me. I

12:20.823 --> 12:21.905
glowed. I glowed all over like one of those 
Halloween skeletons or something. That kind of

12:26.732 --> 12:28.095
scared me for a bit. But anyhow, the Battle of the 
Bows came along. And that was a lot more serious

12:33.922 --> 12:41.990
than most people thought because immediately 
they canceled all industrial referments for 126,

12:33.922 --> 12:41.990
including mine. I got a notice immediately from 
the Colorado draft board saying report down for

12:43.392 --> 12:54.003
termination.

12:54.323 --> 13:00.570
And so I reported for an exam, went through what I 
thought were flying colors. came up to the final

13:01.327 --> 13:11.776
guy who did the stamping and he looked at me and 
looked at the thing and he looked back at me and he

13:01.327 --> 13:11.776
reached over and he got a big stamp saying reject

13:01.327 --> 13:11.776
me. And I started to argue with him. I didn't know 
what the hell. Got home and my wife was really

13:16.761 --> 13:18.542
excited. She had gotten a telegram from the 
backboard saying to ignore the exam. She had

13:23.987 --> 13:31.013
gotten a telegram from Brigadier General Drum of 
New York Selecting Service saying that he had

13:23.987 --> 13:31.013
assumed jurisdiction of my thing, and that I was to 
ignore the Italian. Got another one from the

13:38.555 --> 13:45.583
portion of D.C. somewhere. Forget everything. 
Then we got some kind of a message from the plant

13:46.464 --> 13:55.214
saying to ignore the old thing, but it all came 
after I had my cancer. So there was a pretty

13:55.234 --> 13:59.599
concerted effort to keep me in the malaria 
business, I guess. There were two of us out of 26

14:00.271 --> 14:10.985
that were under that age that didn't get picked up. 
I kind of resented it in a way, but I could

14:11.005 --> 14:14.549
understand the whole thing. My wife thought it was 
great. She didn't want me to do it at all. Do I have

14:19.195 --> 14:22.499
kids at that time? I have one. At

14:23.160 --> 14:27.966
that time I had one.

14:31.152 --> 14:34.878
Maybe I had to, I'm not sure. But anyhow, I didn't 
like New York very well. Again, in the West, that's

14:40.968 --> 14:47.077
kind of the problem, I think. I particularly 
didn't like Buffalo, which had a beautiful

14:48.379 --> 14:55.991
country that had a perfectly precious climate. I 
couldn't move because of the war, of course. Mike

14:59.722 --> 15:02.230
pointed out also that I couldn't get very many 
raises. The only people who got raises during the

15:02.973 --> 15:06.203
war were people who won the unions. It was kind of 
funny because almost every employee in the plant

15:06.223 --> 15:13.005
that was working made more money than the 
superintendents did. Because they could get

15:14.369 --> 15:18.854
raises, and we couldn't. So, some of the guys 
working for me, particularly with their

15:19.154 --> 15:25.521
overtime, would make two or three times as much as I 
made. I knew that. You know, they had the wage price

15:26.422 --> 15:32.369
freeze everywhere, but they never told them that 
the unions were out of that. It kind of got me into

15:32.549 --> 15:33.710
trouble. My brother-in-law, who had an eighth 
grade education, worked for Curtis Wright

15:33.750 --> 15:40.798
Airplanes, twice in cables. And he made almost 
four times as much as I made. We got into college and

15:44.976 --> 15:46.398
so forth. And boy, do you think my in-laws didn't 
learn it. Let you know about it. But actually, it

15:49.721 --> 15:55.568
took me probably 20 years before I could catch up 
with him, you know, afterwards. Yeah. It was quite

15:56.169 --> 15:59.613
a... That's something, yeah, and that is another 
story. What a deal. But anyhow, as soon as the war

16:00.414 --> 16:08.303
was over, I got a job out in the Apache powder 
company. Supposed to be in the Apache region,

16:08.323 --> 16:09.925
Arizona, Pennsylvania or something. Where is 
Benson? It's about 50 miles east of Tucson. Okay.

16:17.849 --> 16:27.985
And at that time there were 960 people in the 
population, and about half of

16:17.849 --> 16:27.985
them were Hispanic. Very few yards from town, in a 
typical desert. Yeah. Is that on the highway out

16:32.399 --> 16:34.381
there? It's on the highway now. We go through this, 
I mean through Arizona a lot, through Tucson and

16:35.443 --> 16:40.108
Phoenix. It's on that highway. What kind of 
powder? It's about 20 miles north of Tombstone.

16:50.841 --> 16:53.284
Military contracts? Powder? No, this company 
actually is the largest commercial explosives

16:53.964 --> 16:59.571
company in the world. It was owned by Phelps Dodge, 
Kennecott, Anaconda, all these big companies

17:00.040 --> 17:08.493
that mine out in the west. Oh, okay. And that was, I 
went out there as an engineer, but I

17:13.040 --> 17:28.663
became a technical supervisor in a couple years, 
so I was in charge of, you know, let's see, product

17:13.040 --> 17:28.663
control, customer service, research and 
development, engineering and development,

17:13.040 --> 17:28.663
safety.

17:32.727 --> 17:34.793
That kind of thing. Everything

17:34.834 --> 17:41.836
except the actual manufacturing. Did you have any 
loading or something? We had three loads there.

17:46.531 --> 17:59.357
All

17:46.531 --> 17:59.357
of them, I think, do. One guy, we don't understand 
why. We feel it. Initially, we all feel it. Yeah, we

18:00.840 --> 18:02.103
didn't know, but it was apparently, it was a 
practice. We had a lot of problems in one thing or

18:02.123 --> 18:03.105
another. And the last

18:03.085 --> 18:23.009
one caught

18:03.085 --> 18:23.009
him about halfway away from the building, about 
two blocks, and picked him up and was tearing his

18:03.085 --> 18:23.009
skin to like a rag. And he had a lot of matches and 
stuff like that. I mean, this was actually the day

18:24.090 --> 18:24.891
of it. So, I think he probably would settle on three 
of them, if you don't know that. I know one of them

18:30.276 --> 18:33.080
was your friend, the psychiatrist. It's like you 
had the evaluation for 104, didn't you? Yeah, I

18:37.485 --> 18:37.826
guess so. I know that's what happened. The, uh, I 
liked that job. That was a good job. He paid well. I

18:46.488 --> 18:58.922
had a chance to do things like go down to New Mexico 
and end up in mines up in the world, in old buildings

18:46.488 --> 18:58.922
and get asked around how to use explosives and this 
kind of thing. I met very interesting people

18:59.523 --> 19:05.550
because all the people in these mines are weird. 
They have a Ph.D. from Marquette University.

19:07.912 --> 19:08.914
They're up there with us. That's why they're 
there. They haven't been to a dentist for 20 years.

19:11.657 --> 19:14.660
They have the packages coming down their beard and 
that kind of stuff. They're weird people. but it's

19:16.627 --> 19:19.250
interesting, nevertheless. I think the history 
of the Forest Service in the South, that's what I do

19:19.270 --> 19:31.282
on the side, in the Southwest region, in Arizona 
and Mexico, and in the Montana area, there's a lot

19:19.270 --> 19:31.282
of these minor types. Well, they're weird. And in 
Alaska. I mean, a lot of them. What I never could

19:38.590 --> 19:43.775
figure out is you see an ad for one of these mining 
engineers, and it goes something like this. Do you

19:43.816 --> 19:46.178
want a mining engineer who has a Ph.D., can speak 
Spanish, Chinese, and English fluently, has 20

19:46.799 --> 19:58.912
years experience, $200 a month for some stupid 
figure like that, and they apparently found them.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.313
That's what I could never figure out. You'd think a 
guy like that would be worth a lot more money, but

20:00.333 --> 20:06.540
that's a different world. Anyhow, my wife did not 
like Arizona. There was, like I say, no grass in any

20:10.804 --> 20:14.308
of the yards. Pretty much a man's country. If you 
like to hunt or prospect and this kind of thing, I

20:16.361 --> 20:24.638
agree that we wanted to be there. Back there, the 
barbecuers up there wasn't very nice. She didn't

20:29.409 --> 20:31.032
like the explosive business. I don't think we need 
to go into why I decided to quit. But anyhow, I

20:36.723 --> 20:38.587
decided to quit. I told her and she said, fine, 
let's go back to where my mother lives. I said, no

20:42.456 --> 20:43.237
way. We'll move halfway and we're going to find a 
place that's got a reasonable climate, good

20:48.663 --> 20:55.149
schools, and a job with some dignity, and they 
don't give a damn if I ever become a plant manager

20:48.663 --> 20:55.149
anymore. I've given up on it. I had to find out that 
the more you became a plant manager, the more hours

20:57.752 --> 21:03.077
you put in. But anyhow, I found this job at A&M. How? 
How? How did that happen? How did I find the one?

21:11.725 --> 21:18.552
They had advertised on the Kennedy Engineering 
News for an engineer, and I answered it. I thought

21:19.713 --> 21:21.735
maybe there was a connection somewhere. Well, I 
just followed up on an ad. I came here as an

21:24.178 --> 21:29.924
associate research engineer. Who was head of that 
lab? Cecil Womble was head of it. It

21:35.289 --> 21:43.358
was kind of an interesting job. It wasn't too 
challenging.

21:47.371 --> 21:53.786
At that time, the cottonseed industry was 
probably at its peak. They had about somewhere

21:53.806 --> 21:58.418
around 450-500 cottonseed mills in the state. 
They had a strong organization called the Cotton

21:58.698 --> 22:01.144
Mill Superintendent's Association. None of 
these outfits, except for Anderson, Clayton, and

22:01.715 --> 22:11.285
a couple others were big enough to do any research 
or so forth. So they managed to get this program

22:11.305 --> 22:16.951
going, which was a really good program. It was 
basically funded by the... Well, it was funded by

22:16.971 --> 22:27.402
the state, but the association had enough 
political plot to get the state to fund it. The

22:29.204 --> 22:33.448
Cotton Seed Research Council, established by the 
state, was split into three. The Texas Bulls

22:33.468 --> 22:42.698
branch of it, I think, to Texas Tech. The 
homemakers, the laundering, the shirts, and that

22:42.718 --> 22:56.832
kind of stuff, to Colorado Women's College, or not 
Colorado, Texas Women's College somewhere. And

22:56.852 --> 22:57.793
then the technical production came in. Do you 
remember if the Textile Engineering Program was

22:58.077 --> 23:04.004
still here, or anything like that? Do you remember 
anything like that? I don't recall that. We had a

23:06.166 --> 23:08.149
thing called the...

23:12.494 --> 23:13.755
I think it had gone on. Institute of Oil... 
Institute of Oil... Continental Oil Technology

23:13.775 --> 23:23.046
or something like that. It was sort of a paper... We 
had a textile engineering program for a while in

23:24.841 --> 23:33.759
the 20s and 30s. I think it was Dan Wall. That part of 
it was handled by Les. He handled the mill.

23:43.893 --> 23:59.438
actually what really sort of happened there was 
was his name perhaps george s perhaps he was the

23:43.893 --> 23:59.438
state chemist back in the 40s and 30s you know we our 
revelation in the state chemists

23:59.857 --> 24:14.960
was

23:59.857 --> 24:14.960
primary because they analyzed the protein 
content and so forth. They had to understand the

24:14.980 --> 24:20.930
standards and of course part of our problem was to 
make sure they managed to do this right. It's kind

24:20.950 --> 24:22.472
of an interesting thing because the protein is the 
expensive part. You lose money if you sell 43% of

24:23.043 --> 24:27.027
the time. You're breaking the law if you sell 
anything under 41% of the time. So you've got an

24:31.372 --> 24:39.881
urge to cut down with a club hanging over your neck 
if you cut too far. So to try and keep just above that

24:39.901 --> 24:50.552
level is a pretty trickier thing, which brings up 
this kind of thought. These all-now

24:51.072 --> 24:56.859
superintendents, by and large, were very 
intelligent men who had a limited education. They

24:57.840 --> 25:06.129
usually started out in the automobile operation 
and they were smart enough and so forth to become

24:57.840 --> 25:06.129
superintendents. But being intelligent and 
having worked their way up like that, they were

25:06.149 --> 25:15.800
pretty self-confident folks. Which meant that it 
was pretty hard to tell them as an engineer. So, for

25:22.780 --> 25:32.142
example, on this protein thing, the way they would 
do it is send out a sample every day to their

25:22.780 --> 25:32.142
commercial lab to be analyzed. They came back a 
little high, they made an adjustment a little

25:32.162 --> 25:36.452
early, they were making an adjustment. And I 
remember working out the statistical quality

25:36.972 --> 25:47.024
control on it and showing that the results of the 
analysis had plus or minus a half percent. So if you

25:47.044 --> 25:53.633
come back with two percent, two tenths of a percent 
higher or something like that, that doesn't mean

25:47.044 --> 25:53.633
you want to make any adjustments at all. And worked 
it out to where they could send out a sample about

25:54.794 --> 26:02.804
once a week and actually do a better job for the 
rest. There you go. Well, I'll give you an example

26:05.744 --> 26:07.607
of that. They have these big, huge fans that pull 
air through cottonsea plows and they've got 100

26:08.588 --> 26:18.461
horsepower motors on them. I mean, they're big. If 
they had a pool of cottonsea, you could just blow

26:20.364 --> 26:24.029
it. I'm from Niagara, so yeah, we have a big... Oh, 
you remember here in the... Yeah, yeah. Now,

26:29.183 --> 26:38.715
basically these fans were discharging through 
about a 10 by 16 inch discharge through, bam, out

26:29.183 --> 26:38.715
into the atmosphere. Which made a hell of a lot of 
noise and so forth. But more than that, it created,

26:41.279 --> 26:47.747
there's a thing called a power recover. If you 
expand that gas through it like a megaphone, in

26:47.767 --> 26:56.659
about a seven degree angle megaphone, the kinetic 
energy in the gas which is pretty high because it's

26:57.010 --> 27:06.983
coming out there at, you know, the value of a sailor 
or something of a high volume, is recovered. And it

27:07.003 --> 27:13.852
turns out you can recover about 10% of your energy 
just by putting a diverging nozzle under this.

27:13.872 --> 27:15.654
This is well-known. In fact, it's... March's

27:18.239 --> 27:29.053
mechanical engineering handbook has a whole page 
on how to design a power recovery for fans. So I

27:29.073 --> 27:34.499
wrote an article suggesting that all these guys 
should put these on. It would cost them maybe $100

27:34.539 --> 27:42.930
to have one made in a sheet metal shop that would A. 
cut down all that noise, B. they would recover 10%

27:34.539 --> 27:42.930
of their power. I even went with suppliers to some 
of these superintendents. They're watching the

27:49.391 --> 27:52.596
page out of the handbook and sending it to me. And 
using such things the same way. Look, if I put an

27:54.879 --> 28:01.168
electric fan in front of this discharge, it would 
turn that fan, right? Well, that fan could be

28:01.188 --> 28:03.171
generating electricity, right? Well, that's 
energy that you're losing. Guess how many people

28:07.597 --> 28:10.201
are using power recovery units on their fans? Not a 
whole lot of people. Not a lot of people. No,

28:13.201 --> 28:14.763
they've been doing this for years. They've been 
working on it. They still won't do it. No, they

28:17.326 --> 28:19.368
still won't do it. But as they're getting back to 
the research business, in a way, the time seems to

28:19.388 --> 28:23.973
have sorted for itself. And the oil mill's out of 
business, because what happened is they went from

28:24.994 --> 28:40.592
screw extraction to solid extraction, which is 
amenable to larger-scale production, more

28:24.994 --> 28:40.592
efficiency. And our lab did a great deal of the work 
on that, showing

28:41.753 --> 28:52.625
how to do it. And that result is, I don't know how 
many oil mill operations there are in the state

28:52.645 --> 29:00.715
now, but I would bet it's probably less than 20. 
They've gone to year-round extraction using

29:00.755 --> 29:11.727
solvent extraction, which a small plant like you 
used to have an oil mill down here and have a soda.

29:12.635 --> 29:17.380
with us too, you know, we couldn't possibly 
compete. So all these guys, the whole industry has

29:17.400 --> 29:27.251
changed dramatically because of the results of 
this. I did some work over in the history of the rice

29:27.271 --> 29:30.855
industry. I got really into rice when I was in New 
Zealand. And they were just starting to work with

29:33.098 --> 29:39.124
the chemical dimming processes. I don't think 
that ever has really become commercial. I don't

29:41.980 --> 29:53.771
know whether it's ever really been adopted. I 
don't really know much about it, except for the

29:53.872 --> 29:58.616
rice oil. But it sounds like it applies pretty much 
to what? Did you do what? Did you? Yeah. Did you do

30:05.383 --> 30:07.605
it? Exactly. In fact, I went to Beaumont about a few 
weeks ago and bought back six bags of rice hulls and

30:08.322 --> 30:20.102
put them in my garden to make some really good 
compost. And now I'm going to plow it up this spring

30:20.122 --> 30:27.715
and get this hull and mulch it clean and start it out 
the original way. We pick them on how much

30:27.695 --> 30:37.120
absorbance they have. For example, we use crushed 
peach pits. because

30:42.292 --> 30:52.566
they're not

30:42.292 --> 30:52.566
important.

31:03.742 --> 31:06.766
Sometimes you don't want the carbonaceous to 
absorb in that condition because it reduces its

31:03.742 --> 31:06.766
sensitivity. So you have a whole progression in 20 
or 30 ingredients that you use for different

31:06.786 --> 31:08.729
purposes. Well, many of the potency labs It was 
kind of

31:14.877 --> 31:27.492
fun. It gave me a chance

31:27.512 --> 31:41.729
to go out and visit a lot of

31:27.512 --> 31:41.729
wild animals and small town rural Texas, which to 
me, I guess I'm just a rural farmer at heart. When

31:41.749 --> 31:42.690
Dr. Calhoun came here, he was an engineer. He 
looked around at what A&M was doing, and he saw a lot

31:43.582 --> 31:56.942
of guys like myself who were full-time research 
engineers, and a bunch of cops who weren't doing

31:43.582 --> 31:56.942
any research. He said, that's not the way it's 
supposed to work. Every cop should be doing

31:58.925 --> 32:00.527
research, and every researcher ought to be 
teaching. So, this was actually on a Friday. One

32:05.339 --> 32:17.049
Friday, I got a phone call from Dr. Lindsay, who was 
in the engineering department, telling me that I

32:05.339 --> 32:17.049
was going to start teaching, following Monday. I 
explained to him that I hadn't been in a classroom

32:17.069 --> 32:19.371
for a long time. He said, that's alright, you don't 
know what the students do. And Monday I was, quote,

32:26.097 --> 32:30.601
teaching. What were you teaching? I started out 
teaching The

32:33.008 --> 32:57.497
real

32:33.008 --> 32:57.497
interesting thing there, I was making pretty good 
money as an associate research engineer, but

32:33.008 --> 32:57.497
since I only had a bachelor of science degree, they 
didn't want to call me a professor.

33:05.712 --> 33:10.498
Fred Benson, who was then head of the experiment 
station, said, no, wait a minute. If we hire a prof

33:10.518 --> 33:20.851
to give them jobs during the summer to work as 
research engineers, we're going

33:10.518 --> 33:20.851
to tease. We pay them according to their power as 
profs. My God, if you hire a research engineer

33:24.556 --> 33:32.566
that's a prof, you're going to pay him and give him 
the title of a prof. I wonder, didn't Did Benson and

33:34.383 --> 33:36.466
Calhoun get along real good? I can't remember. I 
don't know. I have no idea. They must have gotten

33:39.971 --> 33:41.694
along pretty well. They worked. Let me tell you, 
just a sideline. Benson, to me, is one of the

33:45.800 --> 33:49.966
greatest men I have ever met. A lot of people think 
that? Absolutely. He had a knack for picking

33:53.491 --> 33:57.537
not-so-good subordinates. He was...

34:01.467 --> 34:03.070
Well, this is a story I just told you. It's an 
example. He didn't think that was right, and by

34:04.893 --> 34:08.279
God, we're going to do what's right. I don't know 
how many profs there were on the campus, associate

34:08.399 --> 34:17.995
profs, that had just a BS degree, but I suspect I was 
maybe one of them. Alone, or maybe two or three of us

34:18.015 --> 34:20.860
would be the most I would think. Well, there was no 
great professional engineers to get the day off

34:20.840 --> 34:25.247
the gate. Well, a long time. Anyhow, that did hold 
me back. I started on a master's

34:30.416 --> 34:40.512
degree when I came here, because when I came here, 
my idea was to work through college and go to

34:30.416 --> 34:40.512
school. And I started on the master's degree, and 
while I'm working on the master's degree, they

34:40.532 --> 34:46.662
made this rule which make some sense that they 
wouldn't grant any advanced degrees to anyone who

34:47.249 --> 35:13.746
had a uh well by the time i was uh got out of my 
master's i had a uh i was a professor and they

34:47.249 --> 35:13.746
wouldn't let me go for a phd yeah i could take a lot of 
courses and i took i thought i'd taken more courses

34:47.249 --> 35:13.746
than graduate school anybody in this campus 
didn't look at that all the graduate courses They

35:14.300 --> 35:25.953
did both of them in chemistry and statistics, and 
blue transfer, all kinds of good stuff. Anyhow,

35:26.153 --> 35:34.503
I couldn't get an advanced degree, and that held me 
back quite a bit. There was a lot of expansion in

35:34.523 --> 35:43.513
salaries during the 50s, and I kind of got pretty 
well chatteled in on that, because I did not have a

35:34.523 --> 35:43.513
degree. And along about 69, the legislature 
passed this thing saying that the college would

35:44.877 --> 35:53.887
grant sabbatical leave. Good thing. And it worked 
out so you could have six months full pay or a year

35:55.643 --> 36:02.051
for half pay. And I thought, well, that sounds 
pretty good. I called up the Colorado State

36:05.435 --> 36:07.117
University. That's right next to it. We loved them 
when I was a kid. And I loved the mountains. That's a

36:12.082 --> 36:13.544
good place to do school. But then I talked to the guy 
up there. And he says, yeah. and

36:17.429 --> 36:29.220
the fact is that even let me use my research that 
I've done, and the fact of the research, because it

36:17.429 --> 36:29.220
was right down the alley what they were doing. It 
wasn't in ag engineering, but what I was doing was

36:30.381 --> 36:45.715
working with the wall there through toxic files, 
which is, in technical terms, fluid flow through

36:30.381 --> 36:45.715
porous, non-homogeneous, anisotropic And

36:46.437 --> 37:01.992
they were working with water and aquifers for 
producing the irrigation water and that kind of

36:46.437 --> 37:01.992
thing. Same identical equations, everything the 
same. And so it was not something that was foreign

37:06.457 --> 37:13.744
to what they were doing, except it was in the ag 
engineering department at Colorado State. So I

37:14.753 --> 37:20.961
took a sabbatical leave and applied for one and 
immediately got shot down. The

37:22.423 --> 37:33.938
rules had to do with appoint or somehow get a 
committee of professors who would administer the

37:22.423 --> 37:33.938
sabbatical leave program. The very first rule 
they passed when they met, we will not grant

37:33.958 --> 37:40.727
sabbatical leaves for anyone working for an 
advanced degree. They wanted you to be, take one

37:41.804 --> 37:45.688
and go out and write a book or do something like 
that. Well, that screwed me right off the bat. And I

37:48.451 --> 37:54.377
talked to, I guess, Dean Benson. I talked to Dean 
Benson, and he says, well, my guy, he says, if I

37:54.517 --> 38:05.689
remember that law, it says that each branch of the 
college can have its own sabbatical league

37:54.517 --> 38:05.689
committee. And by God, I'm going to appoint a 
committee for the T's, because you work half time

38:05.709 --> 38:10.073
for T's. And by God, they're going to grant you a 
sabbatical leave. Very good. Well, I didn't think

38:14.860 --> 38:17.485
I'd be like this. Well, it was the right thing to do. 
You know? And it's very typical of Dean Benson. I

38:25.919 --> 38:28.483
tell you, he's one of the greatest men I've ever 
met.

38:32.615 --> 38:39.481
They're certainly more than responsible for 
these meetings. But anyhow, I did take a

38:41.002 --> 38:43.705
sabbatical leave. I went up to Colorado where I... 
This is probably a world record. I got a Ph.D. in one

38:49.290 --> 38:51.432
year. That sounds like a record to me. I don't 
believe anybody's ever been bad. No, I don't think

38:55.415 --> 38:56.736
so either. But it is a Ph.D. in agricultural 
engineering. I got up there and the first semester

39:01.589 --> 39:14.428
went through and I

39:01.589 --> 39:14.428
was selling my stock. When I got it, it dropped from 
60 down to about 20. I figured, man, I don't want to

39:19.535 --> 39:23.040
sell that stuff. And I walked into the Department 
of Law office one day with my mail, grouching out

39:24.016 --> 39:34.032
loud, you know, that I don't know what I'm going to 
do. I just don't want to sell that stock. I'm short

39:36.436 --> 39:41.243
on money and all the wrong mail. It shows the 
importance of being nice to people. And I've

39:42.786 --> 39:43.767
always been nice to the secretary there. She's 
always been nice to the secretary. She's the chief

39:45.290 --> 39:46.531
of the day. And she heard me. She went back in. She 
says, well, you know something. The School of

39:50.999 --> 40:01.436
Engineering, or Graduate School of Engineering 
has a scholarship for the outstanding scholar in

39:50.999 --> 40:01.436
the graduate school. She said, I seem to remember 
you've made all A's. I said, yeah. Well, I'm going

40:04.941 --> 40:09.288
to apply for that for you. I said, okay, go ahead. I 
didn't think anything about it. About three weeks

40:13.215 --> 40:16.500
later, I'm going to be on my last scholarship. I 
didn't have to be wonderful. I didn't have to sell

40:18.433 --> 40:20.838
my stock. I hope your stock went back up. No, it 
didn't. I finally sold it. But anyhow, I think it

40:26.349 --> 40:31.519
was... a good, pure indication of why a page had 
good manners. Really. She didn't need to do that.

40:39.869 --> 40:40.870
It was actually effort on her part. I didn't even 
know about it. I wouldn't have thought of barring

40:43.353 --> 40:46.597
for it anyhow. I thought I was too old to ever get a 
scholarship, and we didn't. That was pretty neat.

40:53.446 --> 40:58.452
I was an outstanding student in graduate school, 
which I should have been. They made me take some

40:59.579 --> 41:07.287
courses up there, sort of core courses for what 
they did. One of them was being transferred. I

41:09.629 --> 41:16.636
explained to them, hey, man, they've been 
teaching deep transfer for 20 years. That's all

41:16.656 --> 41:17.077
right. We've got to take it. This was it. I was 
taught by an old Dutch guy, a young man, whose

41:18.939 --> 41:25.245
greatest delight was the fact that nobody had ever 
made 100 in any of his courses. That, to him, was a

41:26.686 --> 41:28.388
bad lawnmower. Typical German type of attitude. I 
didn't know. Come so long as they quiz, I made a

41:31.850 --> 41:40.139
hundred of them. Like they devastated this poor 
old guy. He really was upset. The next quiz, I think

41:44.103 --> 41:50.589
the class average was 19, if I remember correctly. 
I made a hundred. He was really devastated. I bet

41:53.252 --> 41:54.793
the class was down over here. No, they all sat 
around me then. That was the first time in my life I

41:56.075 --> 41:57.396
had... Everybody sitting as close as they could 
when they took an exam as they could get. But

42:03.054 --> 42:07.780
anyhow,

42:03.054 --> 42:07.780
came to the final exam. It was a doozer.

42:12.626 --> 42:13.307
I got a 93 on it. So then after I looked at it, I took it 
back up to him and I said, sir, this is absolutely

42:13.347 --> 42:22.017
correct.

42:28.443 --> 42:33.028
That really, that really tore him up. Ruined his 
career. It was funny because I couldn't see why it

42:36.111 --> 42:39.795
was of any importance to him in the first place. I 
should be proud of that. It really got to him. But

42:43.119 --> 42:45.602
anyhow, he was going. Hardly any excuse for not 
getting straight A's, but there he is. Like I said,

42:49.326 --> 42:52.169
he enjoyed it. But anyhow, I did get my degree up 
there and came back here. When

42:59.054 --> 43:17.788
did

42:59.054 --> 43:17.788
you retire? 1986. I worked two years past 65. Maybe 
you could get more pension. You could get more on

43:19.171 --> 43:19.932
Social Security. They

43:21.143 --> 43:33.637
weren't actuarial for me, but they were for her.

43:35.639 --> 43:45.970
And the older I got, the less my actuarial benefits 
were, because I was i was older that way it's very

43:46.507 --> 44:14.050
tricky and it turned out that if you're working 
past 67 you got two percent more each year for

43:46.507 --> 44:14.050
working but you got less each year because you're 
working there you were getting older and it

43:46.507 --> 44:14.050
crossed the threshold with 67 so i quit i retired 
technically but i would modify it certainly yeah i

43:46.507 --> 44:14.050
think one semester but uh well i went on that too let 
me tell you about that They were short on somebody

44:14.975 --> 44:17.398
to teach 204. And I said, well, I'll teach 204 the 
next semester. You know, when you're going to do

44:23.306 --> 44:30.216
that, you take

44:23.306 --> 44:30.216
a certain with you, but at the same time, you get a 
salary. Yeah.

44:33.521 --> 44:41.291
Certain that I found last semester

44:33.521 --> 44:41.291
that for every dollar I made, Social Security took 
away 50 cents. Well, I knew it. Yeah. So that meant I

44:42.573 --> 44:44.676
made 50 cents out of it. Yeah. But I also had to pay 
teacher's retirement, which was 8%, so that took

44:45.113 --> 44:51.080
off making 42 cents out of the dollar. But I also had 
to pay Social Security, which was another 6%,

44:51.100 --> 45:00.350
which brought me down to 36%.

45:02.112 --> 45:13.045
Then I had medical

45:02.112 --> 45:13.045
and these others to pay. And I had to pay teachers 
retirement, which was another 8%. And when I got

45:22.111 --> 45:29.067
through, by the time I had gotten through, I made 
something like 8 cents on the dollar. I think I

45:29.588 --> 45:32.856
figured out I made $200 teaching the whole 
semester. I figured that's a bunch of wood. Let me

45:36.434 --> 45:49.694
ask

45:36.434 --> 45:49.694
you about the department a little bit. Going back 
to Stegman, did you become a member of the chemical

45:50.435 --> 45:58.708
engineering department? You're stepping out of 
research, out of the

46:00.207 --> 46:06.319
county lab. Well, I was split between the two. 
Half-time, half-and-half. Until after I got back

46:11.749 --> 46:16.658
from getting my Ph.D., and then I was full-time 
over here. Now, when you made that, doing both,

46:20.305 --> 46:26.375
You're answering, your research boss was who? He 
died and was replaced

46:26.455 --> 46:37.493
with Carl Peter. When I came back,

46:49.195 --> 47:00.505
When I came back, one of the things we got in charge 
of, we had a big argument at some time as to what I was

46:49.195 --> 47:00.505
going to do.
