WEBVTT

00:01.921 --> 00:08.228
With the doctor, you paid 50 cents every two weeks 
per family, and that took care of all the medical

00:01.921 --> 00:08.228
services. No, that wouldn't take care of the 
medicine. They had to pay the drugs, too, you know.

00:12.392 --> 00:15.595
Yeah, but the doctor, he'd get that 50 cents from 
each family. That was understood among the

00:15.615 --> 00:25.566
Mexicans, too, you know, that when payday came, 
you got to pay that 50 cents for the doctor, so much

00:15.615 --> 00:25.566
for the drugs. The

00:26.356 --> 00:34.391
bookkeeper would take that right off of their 
paycheck. Who was the bookkeeper? Theodore

00:37.115 --> 00:38.237
Walter. Theodore Walter? W-A-L-T-E-R. And was he 
at the commissary? No, he did live over here on

00:44.990 --> 00:48.516
the... When you come out here, the last house, you 
know, not the last house is on this side, where the

00:48.766 --> 00:56.635
road goes that way. That goes to Cabot Ridge. And he 
lived right behind those woods over there, down

00:59.358 --> 01:05.584
the road a little piece. I see. And he would come in 
every two weeks and fix the books, you know, and

01:07.026 --> 01:17.878
they'd go to 7-1 to go to town in the buggy and get the 
money, you know. So they paid you and the Mexicans

01:18.247 --> 01:21.271
in cash? Yeah, cash, yeah. He'd go to that money, 
get the money that he would then pay off, you know,

01:23.093 --> 01:28.761
at the cumbersome, you know, or eat at Grandma's 
house. Like I've been telling them, every two

01:30.563 --> 01:38.854
weeks he'd go to town to get the payroll, five, six 
hundred dollars, and nobody didn't rob him one

01:30.563 --> 01:38.854
time. you know, all the time, all them years. But I 
bet these days he couldn't do it in a horse and

01:41.770 --> 01:44.393
buggy. He would get outside the city and somebody 
robbed him. Oh, my gosh. That is incredible. That

01:51.260 --> 01:52.422
there were no robberies. Yeah, not at all. You 
know, the Mexicans all knew it. You'd go to town

01:56.106 --> 01:57.808
every other week. You didn't get that payroll 
file, $600. So the Mexicans would go to Rockville

02:00.611 --> 02:04.815
to pick up their money? No. Walter... the 
bookkeeper, he'd go down and get the money from the

02:07.538 --> 02:15.432
bank on the side of this and pay off that even out 
there at the commissary, you know, at the store,

02:07.538 --> 02:15.432
yeah, pay off, yeah. And then would the Mexicans 
come into town to spend their money? Yeah, they

02:18.438 --> 02:20.061
spent some, yeah. I see. Do you remember any, you 
know, anecdotal stories you know, about the

02:29.678 --> 02:34.484
mines, anything that you, when you're just 
sitting down sometime and thinking about mining?

02:34.504 --> 02:37.127
They like, the Mexicans like to drink a lot, you 
know. They'd come home from town drunk off a hoop in

02:37.147 --> 02:41.793
the holland, you know. What would they drink, 
Muslim? Was it beer or whiskey? I don't know.

02:49.162 --> 02:57.272
They'd hoot from holland, they'd get too bad, then 
Grandma would, you know, They called her mama,

02:58.940 --> 03:01.144
grandmother. Grandma Vogel? Uh-huh. Called her 
mama. She was brought to camp, you know, in the

03:04.630 --> 03:06.653
house. She ran the camp then. Uh-huh. She owned the 
house. Well, the mines too long, you know, they

03:11.582 --> 03:16.891
were hard too. Did they like Grandma Vogel? Yeah, 
they liked her. She told them they used to behave,

03:20.477 --> 03:22.821
you know. She'd tell them to behave, and they'd 
say, Mama, I'm sorry. I'm not going to do it no more.

03:27.482 --> 03:28.784
I'm not going to do it no more. Next Saturday, come 
along and get drunk again. But that's natural.

03:37.797 --> 03:39.399
They do that these days, too. Would you like to come 
and sit down here? Oh, I want to do something first.

03:43.565 --> 03:47.892
OK. Grandpa Vogel, he did that camp out there. He 
put up a dance hall. He figured it would have

03:49.133 --> 03:51.517
entertainment, you know? Mm-hmm. They had one 
dance, the first night they had a dance, they had a

03:52.585 --> 03:57.852
big fight and a bunch of men got cut up, you know. He 
said if they couldn't behave themselves, they

03:58.653 --> 04:03.059
don't need no entertainment, so no more dances. 
You had one dance at the dance hall? Yeah, this one.

04:05.943 --> 04:06.924
He tore down after all. He said if they couldn't 
behave themselves, he didn't want that kind of

04:06.944 --> 04:10.970
doings, you know. So he finally tore it down again. 
They had a big two-story building there. They call

04:17.939 --> 04:19.521
it the boarding house. He had that dance hall built 
around here, and he could sit around it, you know,

04:19.585 --> 04:25.514
and dance in the middle. Yeah, one day, the first 
night, a bunch of messengers got drunk, you know,

04:25.534 --> 04:33.446
they cut the university and used a knife and all 
that, you know. Do you remember about what year

04:33.466 --> 04:35.309
this was? I don't remember. I guess I'm old enough 
to remember, but he said no more. Yeah, you was too

04:43.401 --> 04:45.424
young those days. Yeah, I was too young then. I was 
born in 1900. See, I'll be 77 years old in December

04:49.981 --> 04:53.727
21st. December 21st, 1900 when I was born. That's a 
long time. And I remember Grandpa died, I

04:59.817 --> 05:03.984
remember. That was about what time? I don't 
remember what year. Grandpa, see, he fell. They

05:08.772 --> 05:12.137
dig a shaft, you know, and he fell down there one 
day, you know. He said, I guess, you know, and he

05:12.404 --> 05:15.848
died. Grandpa did, yeah. Grandpa Vogel. Yes.

05:22.036 --> 05:29.665
Do you remember the great flood of the early 1920s 
when Rockville inundated with all this rain? I

05:29.685 --> 05:30.906
don't remember. I don't believe. In 1930, I guess 
it did. Well, how did the Depression affect you? Do

05:40.113 --> 05:43.257
you remember how the Depression affected the 
mines? You mean 1930? Right. Well, they didn't

05:46.821 --> 05:48.744
have no more mines then. The mines quit in 1917, the 
mines. They didn't have no more mines then. In

05:55.612 --> 05:59.417
1917, the mines all quit out here. All but one, a 
Spanish... A full 100-hour mine. Dr. Sprott had a

06:08.513 --> 06:13.518
mine yet later on, but they, mines, 1930, mines was 
all equipped. We lived out here over 19, we moved

06:13.618 --> 06:17.042
out here in 1919. The mines were all played out by 
then.

06:23.449 --> 06:26.753
No, they couldn't sell enough lignite then when 
they got that oil, you know. In the end, they used

06:26.773 --> 06:33.660
lignite, and when they got the boomer, they 
started to gush it down on them. Then they started

06:33.995 --> 06:37.880
using the oil and gas because they were cheaper, 
you know, and cleaner. They quit using lignite, so

06:37.900 --> 06:40.984
they had to quit. Now, now, oil is so hard, you know, 
they could use lignite to get, you know. I go to A&M

06:46.371 --> 06:49.175
College. Right. Right. And they quit, too, then, 
you know. They said oil was cheaper, and they quit

06:54.422 --> 06:58.347
buying it. So, Daddy said, you know, he was trying 
to... If you go out to Henry, McCurtain's brown

07:02.615 --> 07:13.550
boy, you know, he might take you out and show you 
around, you know, if he got time. Somebody, he

07:14.171 --> 07:16.093
wasn't here before, no. No, that was Julio. What? 
That was Julio. Somebody else, you know, said the

07:19.558 --> 07:23.403
brown boy took him out there and showed him around, 
you know. See, he owns all that old rich amount. He

07:27.068 --> 07:30.833
went for the railroad, so you might not catch him in 
town during the week. Mostly on Sundays. He's at

07:33.306 --> 07:34.488
home some days. I don't know. Well, I'll be here for 
a couple weeks. You can find out. If you go out

07:40.096 --> 07:43.160
there, his...

07:51.332 --> 07:53.455
But that, we talk too much? Oh, no, no. I just wanted 
to get it back to the starting place. I wanted you to

07:56.420 --> 08:00.145
tell me about the malaria of my... Oh. Well, we told 
you we had to cut the doctor. And we'd have malaria,

08:03.118 --> 08:07.123
fever. Some of us in our family would too, 
Mexicans. And we'd get the doctor to come out. And

08:16.055 --> 08:19.220
everybody paid their dues. So how would you catch 
malaria out of mines? I don't know. Those little

08:25.808 --> 08:28.892
holes, you know, had too much water in them, you 
know. The mosquitoes were thick, you know. Yeah,

08:31.195 --> 08:33.157
the mosquitoes. Did you grow up at the mines, 
Cassidy? We was all born out there but the baby

08:36.561 --> 08:38.684
sister. 1908, I see. But you never went down in the 
mine? Yeah, I went down. Oh, you did? We did too one

08:45.572 --> 08:47.715
time, we girls. He just went with that, you know. He 
had to go down there. He used to look around. He

08:51.942 --> 08:52.803
called it. He used to go down there and look. He'd 
survey down there, you know, surveyed with a

08:55.367 --> 09:01.876
compass and what you call those tapes, you know, 
with the numbers. What do you call them? Tape

09:03.879 --> 09:04.500
lines. Tape lines. And, you know, I'd help him 
sometimes, you know. You know, carry the end of the

09:08.024 --> 09:15.795
tape line, you know, he'd measure the length, you 
know, and he'd write it down, you know. You did that

09:16.332 --> 09:18.795
with your father? Did you get paid for that? Did you 
ever go down in the mine to work to get paid?

09:39.670 --> 09:43.734
They loaded a box called one of these bricks, you 
know. We had a brickyard out there, too. And I

09:45.475 --> 09:47.257
decided to come out there. There was about a half a 
brick right there. It hit me right on the top of the

09:49.619 --> 09:52.362
head here. It all bled. It shot out. I have a finger 
on that. I went home, you know. Did they make

09:56.806 --> 09:58.267
bricks? Yeah, they had a brickyard, too. Do you 
remember how they did that, how they made the

10:02.111 --> 10:05.874
bricks? They had a press. They had a press that 
pressed them. Crested bricks, yeah.

10:15.085 --> 10:19.690
How big was the kiln? Eight

10:20.231 --> 10:27.540
foot

10:20.231 --> 10:27.540
size. Right.

10:31.848 --> 10:36.493
Did this clay come right along with the lignite? 
No, I think they made the clay. In the mines, there

10:39.237 --> 10:43.221
also is a white, they call it white clay. They used 
some of it. They made a clay pit on top of the ground,

10:45.143 --> 10:53.233
stripped the sand off, you know, and got that red 
clay and then that other below that. Yeah, they'd

10:53.253 --> 10:54.834
make those fire clay. They call it fire clay, that 
white clay. They had a thing kind of like you see,

10:57.317 --> 11:01.382
those refrigerators they used to scrape with. 
Kind of like a bulldozer. Right. They'd drag it

11:04.500 --> 11:05.882
along behind the mule. But there's big drums that 
go around it. There's wheels on there, you know.

11:09.847 --> 11:15.896
And when they had it loaded, they'd make it where 
it'd come up, you know what I mean? The load. It

11:16.757 --> 11:17.378
closed up. You know what I mean? It'd rise there, 
and the mules would pull it out, you know. I see. And

11:21.463 --> 11:24.067
pull it to the press, you know. The mules would pull 
it under the shed where they'd dump it. Press the

11:27.712 --> 11:28.453
dump. Lay in for it to go to the press. Mm-hmm. Well, 
did, once you all moved here, Gus, did you ever go

11:33.155 --> 11:38.462
back out to the mines? Or did you pretty much forget 
about them once you left the mines? No, I didn't go

11:42.348 --> 11:43.810
out there. We'd go fishing.

11:48.556 --> 11:50.018
It changed, though, it seemed like. If we go out 
there now, it seemed like it changed a whole lot.

11:53.423 --> 11:56.407
You know, it don't look like the right place, kind 
of. Trees got big and, you know, and changed, you

11:56.427 --> 12:00.192
know, kind of. Do you happen to remember the Texas 
Coal Company mine site at all? Which one was the

12:04.574 --> 12:07.898
Texas Coal Company, Gus? I don't think you know 
that. What we're trying to do is to map that site.

12:15.286 --> 12:19.792
They don't have maps of all the mines? Well, we do 
have that, but we don't have an actual layout of the

12:19.812 --> 12:23.496
camps. Oh. And like where your house was and all the 
mines and where the commissary was and where all

12:24.744 --> 12:31.531
the little Mexican towns were. Well, our house and 
grandmother's was on the hill like. And it was kind

12:35.355 --> 12:37.818
of slanted down, you know what I mean? Well, I tell 
you what, the Mexican really sat on the highway,

12:37.838 --> 12:42.343
you know, the Mexican houses. We lived right 
across the river. And it comes down, it comes down

12:44.505 --> 12:49.110
right at the Mexican houses there, right along in 
there somewhere. I see. Really across the river.

12:50.852 --> 12:53.635
And then...

12:54.627 --> 12:59.372
It was a little old store right beside our house, 
you know, in the camp, you know, in the camp. They

13:00.373 --> 13:03.997
had three stores, I believe. I believe the Texas 
mine was down there, Stripling's. I mean, on the

13:07.381 --> 13:10.724
other side, the Texas mine was down there. On the 
other side of our mine. I call that our mine because

13:12.726 --> 13:15.569
that's grandmother's. Well, that's close 
enough. Yeah. Do you remember anything else in

13:21.307 --> 13:24.652
mind, sir, when you were a little kid?

13:27.235 --> 13:29.038
Did you play with the Mexican children? No, pretty 
much. Well, none of us ever played with the

13:31.882 --> 13:33.704
Mexicans. See, like those days, it wasn't like 
now. You know, they were separated. Now, lots of

13:38.350 --> 13:42.716
the grown boys would play baseball with the 
Mexicans. Yeah, yeah, play sometimes. You had a

13:44.054 --> 13:49.782
big baseball field there, and they'd play 
baseball there. Did you play baseball? Sure. What

13:51.886 --> 13:53.488
position did you play? Oh, it was like the first 
base. All right. Not that far to run the dugout, is

13:56.172 --> 13:57.955
it? Willie, did you play baseball? I played some. I 
never did like the back catch, you know. It wasn't

14:04.724 --> 14:06.367
my play. We girls played baseball, too, and we 
could play pretty good, too. I tell you. I was like

14:11.735 --> 14:13.217
the first baseman. We went to Tower Ridge School, 
that's where we went to school. Right across the

14:17.415 --> 14:22.020
railroad and you go over there, you see that 
Mexican camp out there? You go straight up here,

14:22.140 --> 14:24.462
you know where Tower Ridge is at. That's where we 
went to school. All of us except, when we moved over

14:26.924 --> 14:40.217
here, then the babysitter was born over here, and 
she and Gus and several more of the other ones went

14:26.924 --> 14:40.217
over here too. And after I was a young sister, I went 
to Roger's school after all, you know. Three of

14:49.243 --> 14:50.345
them graduated. I mean,

14:50.505 --> 15:03.268
Brother Ernest and Sister Claire and Emmer, they 
graduated up here at Roger's school. I guess you

15:04.717 --> 15:10.183
were saying that it was pretty well separated 
between the Mexicans and the Anglicans. Were

15:10.223 --> 15:12.765
there any blacks that worked at the mine? At the 
brickyard. It was funny that the niggers worked at

15:14.067 --> 15:20.954
the brickyard and the Mexicans, they worked at the 
mine. Not a nigger working in the mine. I don't

15:24.617 --> 15:25.738
know. They wouldn't go down in there. They hung 
around the brickyard at the nigger's wood. You

15:31.379 --> 15:34.022
never did ask them why they wouldn't go down to the 
mine? Was it more money at the brickyard? No, I

15:36.185 --> 15:38.127
don't believe. About the same? They sprayed her 
just to go down there. Well,

15:42.412 --> 15:47.618
I think I would be, too. That is funny, you know, a 
human being. You know, some places, they go down

15:50.121 --> 15:58.551
into the deep, you know, and you crawl way up from 
here to up by that nigger house up there, you know.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.863
And all that dirt on top of you, what if that door 
falls? Right, yeah. I have it. We did have two

16:05.527 --> 16:09.051
boiler explosions out back of mine. One. One, I 
mean, one. Do you remember what year that was,

16:11.573 --> 16:14.056
Louise? What year that boiler exploded? That was 
1900.

16:21.884 --> 16:23.866
Must have been 10 or 12, huh? No, it was late in that. 
13 or 14? Because we had that other mine, the last

16:28.720 --> 16:37.932
mine was up there, that shell mine. Do you remember 
that cave-in? Uh-huh. That mine where they were—

16:40.996 --> 16:45.963
That was the same mine where they brought the 
exposed, where it caved in. It's still there. It's

16:48.587 --> 16:50.069
holding water now. Is it? Do you all remember that? 
Did you go down to the cave-in? Uh-huh. Did you— We

16:56.665 --> 16:58.708
were going to school then, yeah. And whenever it 
would rain a whole lot, you know, we had to walk to

16:59.550 --> 17:03.536
school. And it was about three miles to school. And 
we had to walk, carry our own lunch baskets and

17:08.825 --> 17:16.618
satchel full of books and things, you know. We were 
loaded down. Well, with that cave being in 1913,

17:18.772 --> 17:23.237
did you all go out there? You would have been 13 
years old, and Gus would have been five. Did you go

17:28.443 --> 17:30.525
out there and help dig them out? No, not me. I didn't 
work there. I wasn't old enough. Do you remember

17:35.511 --> 17:36.392
that scene? I was going to school, yeah. And when it 
rained a whole lot, my mother would send one of the

17:37.433 --> 17:47.985
workers, the white men and all, Send them with a 
wagon and a team and raincoats and umbrellas and

17:48.590 --> 17:54.961
things. Send them to school after us kids. And 
that's just when it happened. We were all in

18:01.172 --> 18:04.218
school.

18:06.241 --> 18:08.906
The time changed so much. Those days, all we had 
was... a pencil and a pen. That's where we began,

18:13.476 --> 18:15.258
you know. Right, you didn't have a fancy tape 
recorder. And later on, when you get a little

18:17.260 --> 18:23.707
older, you have to have some ink and an ink pen, you 
know. These days, look what you have to have these

18:23.727 --> 18:27.771
days to get it. Right. The school has changed. 
Well, y'all went to your own school then. You

18:32.535 --> 18:34.337
didn't go to school with the Mexicans? No, no. That 
was all separate. Did you like going to the school

18:39.822 --> 18:41.685
guys? Yeah, I liked it when I got older.

18:46.371 --> 18:48.354
Yeah, Willie and I were talking a few moments ago. 
Willie Holtzholdt. Remember Willie Holtzholdt?

18:50.957 --> 18:53.060
Holtzholdt, yeah, I'm sorry. And he played hooky 
so much. Yeah. He'd go with us to where he kept

18:56.145 --> 18:58.668
halfway away. There's a big place with woods on 
each side of the road, you know. And he'd go to the

19:03.835 --> 19:05.337
van. He'd say, all right, I'll see y'all this 
evening when y'all come back. And he'd go in those

19:09.033 --> 19:13.158
woods and stay in there until we'd come back home 
from school. And when we got there, he'd be there

19:14.480 --> 19:17.103
waiting for us. And he'd walk home with us so nobody 
knew he didn't go to school, you know. But I believe

19:21.969 --> 19:25.173
he had a sister go to school, and she's older. And I 
think she told her daddy about him. And her daddy

19:28.638 --> 19:31.401
gave him a good whipping. Some mornings he had to 
take them to school halfway, you know. to make them

19:36.961 --> 19:38.364
go. Well, Gus, what do you think? Don't tell him we 
told all of us. Okay, I won't. I won't tell him. He

19:46.219 --> 19:48.523
may not have told you himself. Yeah, he told me 
himself. Don't like to be in the middle of it. He

19:52.752 --> 19:59.104
talked about time, the one time at the store, and I 
said, at the city food market, I said, we used to go

19:52.752 --> 19:59.104
to school to get them. He said, yes, Willie learned 
something, but I didn't. I played hooky every day.

20:03.790 --> 20:07.074
He said, Willie learned something, learned how to 
write and read. I can't even write my own name, he

20:07.154 --> 20:08.756
said. I told him. Gus, what did you think when your 
older brother went down into the mines? Do you

20:16.004 --> 20:16.785
remember that?

20:19.548 --> 20:20.349
He don't remember. He wasn't just old enough yet. 
Do you remember how much you were getting paid back

20:26.287 --> 20:30.692
then when you were working in the mine? I don't 
remember nothing now. When you worked in the mine,

20:32.474 --> 20:36.079
you got paid by them little cars you filled. I was 
wondering if you remembered how much it was per

20:36.399 --> 20:39.823
farm. If you wouldn't fill but one, you wouldn't 
make much. Right. Some would be good diggers, and

20:44.709 --> 20:47.472
some wouldn't. They'd come out of there early, and 
some would stay until... They wouldn't work on the

20:51.337 --> 20:56.243
Saturday, just couldn't get no biscuits and work 
on the Saturday, just... Well, they could get all

20:56.729 --> 21:00.074
the coal they wanted anyway, you know, usually. 
They had to buy the mines ore, too, you know. They

21:03.980 --> 21:07.826
wouldn't work on the city unless they'd get 
behind, you know, neat coal, extra, you know. They

21:07.907 --> 21:13.716
had a switch running from the highway right there 
that's running out there now. They had a switch

21:15.078 --> 21:18.363
from there on going out to the mines. And every 
day... When they had some cars loaded, they'd call

21:21.215 --> 21:30.385
it in, you know, out to town, and the trains, they 
had a special train. They would come out to the

21:30.505 --> 21:31.666
mine? They'd come out there and go out there and 
they'd switch and get those cars of coal out of

21:31.686 --> 21:36.692
there. He'd bring the empties, you know, and take 
the fumes back to town. He'd go to every mine, you

21:42.618 --> 21:46.142
know, out there the same day, you know, yeah. Do you 
remember when the trucks came out to the mines?

21:52.767 --> 21:53.408
Trucks. Trucks. Did they ever use trucks? No, 
there wasn't no cars until... I think my Uncle

21:59.195 --> 22:02.899
Herman had the first car.

22:05.422 --> 22:07.184
That's Herman Vogel, right? Uh-huh. 1915, I 
think, or 16. That's when cars started coming in,

22:09.607 --> 22:11.930
you know. And he had one, a beauty. They went to town 
one night... coming home and there was an old mule

22:18.573 --> 22:22.096
standing in the road. He thought the mule would 
move and the mule, I guess, just stood there and he

22:22.116 --> 22:36.750
ran into him and the mule kicked and kicked the 
radiator, horn of the radiator. So he had to get

22:36.770 --> 22:38.872
that fixed up. Yeah, yeah. He said, I slowed up but 
the mule wouldn't move, he said.

22:48.745 --> 22:51.369
Well, do you know what's happened to the Mexican 
families? There's some still living. Yeah, I

22:54.174 --> 22:56.959
talked to a couple of them this morning. I'm going 
to go back and we're going to do the same thing. He

23:01.787 --> 23:03.851
talked to a real old lady out there. A real old lady. 
She might have moved to town by now. Mr. Potter died

23:07.837 --> 23:12.205
here a month or two ago. But she's got sons. What do 
you mean? Not that an old lady didn't die. There's

23:16.422 --> 23:18.144
another old lady. I forget what her name is. But 
always come out and ask about Mama, that real old

23:19.365 --> 23:22.409
lady. She didn't die. They come out here? Louise. 
Uh-uh. She didn't die because I talked to her

23:27.394 --> 23:30.178
before yesterday. The other old lady died. They 
come out. We grow vegetables and sell them, you

23:33.021 --> 23:36.805
know. Oh, you still do that? Uh-uh.

23:42.745 --> 23:44.830
Gus raises plants. Some of them come out here and 
get plants. These old Mexican women would come out

23:48.659 --> 23:52.950
here and buy plants. And they're just, oh, they're 
just glad to see you. They just shake hands and

23:57.741 --> 23:59.826
talk. They were very friendly. Ruth ordained 
them. I lived in town and I'd meet up with one of

24:04.487 --> 24:09.814
those old Mexican men that worked in the mine. He 
didn't know me. He'd come there and shake hands

24:11.477 --> 24:17.365
with me and ask me how Mama was and how Papa was and 
how Mata was. Asked her all about the family, you

24:17.465 --> 24:21.391
know. They were real friendly.

24:26.873 --> 24:29.897
If you ever get more mad at you, you just better look 
out. He might as well stick you with a knife or

24:29.957 --> 24:35.764
something. They was bad on you tonight when they 
get mad. They use a knife more than a gun. They take a

24:41.131 --> 24:42.092
knife. You never had a run in, was it? You never had a 
run in.

24:56.354 --> 24:59.958
Do you think the lignite mining was good for 
Rockville? Yeah, it helped. Gave more work to do.

25:07.227 --> 25:09.910
What do you think about Shell Oil coming in here 
now? There'll be a lot more people coming in.

25:12.793 --> 25:20.302
They're sure building up some new homes all around 
in Westwood and different places. We went, I met

25:20.322 --> 25:26.209
you from down Baytown, because I feel anxious. So I 
decided to build a dance hall, you know, a dance

25:28.501 --> 25:35.571
hall for the Mexicans, you know. So they'd have 
some fun too, you know. And he built a brand new one.

25:39.997 --> 25:49.570
And the first dance, one of them was getting mad 
with the other that danced with his wife or

25:39.997 --> 25:49.570
something, you know. And they started cutting up 
each other. And Papa said, where are you? If y'all

25:53.223 --> 25:57.549
want to do that, I just tag back down. He tore it back 
down. And that was Papa Lorraine? No, that was

26:00.693 --> 26:02.836
Grandpa. That was Grandpa. He said, well, if y'all 
want to fight and kill each other, I just tag back

26:04.298 --> 26:11.528
down. He tore it back down. They said one day. One 
day. They had weddings out there, too. And I tell

26:18.177 --> 26:20.580
you, when they have a wedding, they have a wedding. 
They first get married by the Justice of the Peace.

26:24.777 --> 26:28.362
Would the Justice of the Peace come out to the 
mining camp? I guess if they wanted him to, but I

26:28.382 --> 26:34.350
believe they always went to town. They'd get 
married at Justice of the Peace, and that night

26:35.631 --> 26:43.942
they'd have a

26:35.631 --> 26:43.942
big doing. They'd dance, and... They'd always 
invite Grandma Vogel and Mother and Daddy in if

26:47.932 --> 26:57.862
they wanted to go. Did your parents, grandparents 
go to those weddings? Yeah, I went too. They took us

27:01.866 --> 27:03.968
older girls too along. Did you have a good time? 
Well, we just watched. Just watched. But they'd

27:09.133 --> 27:12.977
ask Mother and Grandma to dance if they wanted to 
dance. And they'd let them dance first, you know,

27:13.835 --> 27:19.222
and then later on the others would dance. And when 
Sunday morning would come, they'd all dress up and

27:19.702 --> 27:25.710
go to town, to church. They'd get married again. 
And some of the women would stay at home and they'd

27:29.615 --> 27:40.548
cook a big dinner, chicken and all kinds of, you 
know, big dinner. And they'd cook them outside in

27:40.588 --> 27:43.572
boiling pots. They'd cook out there in them, a big 
old dinner. They'd bring, at their time, some

27:49.122 --> 27:57.950
they'd bring grandmother a plateful of food, and 
they'd bring us a plateful of food. Wow. That was

27:59.151 --> 27:59.752
nice. Uh-huh. They liked the guitar a whole lot. 
They liked the guitar. Did you ever learn how to

28:06.838 --> 28:08.480
play it? No. I never could learn. We never did learn 
how to play anything. Well, we wasn't able to take

28:14.078 --> 28:18.583
the music. When they'd have their weddings 
sometimes, they'd leave and they'd have what you

28:18.723 --> 28:27.192
call game roosters, you know what I mean? Five game 
roosters. Oh, yeah, game roosters. Yeah, and

28:29.574 --> 28:33.098
they, on Sundays, they'd always have a fight. One 
would take it to the other house and do a lot of, you

28:33.198 --> 28:41.487
know, let's see what you can fight, you know, best, 
you know, win, you know. So they'd raise their own

28:41.804 --> 28:43.246
cocks? Yeah, yeah. I see. And sometimes they'd 
tell him, he had a .22, you know what I mean? That

28:49.094 --> 28:50.355
little rifle. Right. They'd have a wedding. They 
wanted to kill him when them roosters came by. They

28:53.900 --> 28:55.382
couldn't catch him, you know? So they'd tell him to 
come down there and he'd shoot him with that little

28:55.883 --> 28:59.428
rifle. They'd give him a dollar for every one of his 
shoots, you know. Did you watch any of the cock

29:03.894 --> 29:05.616
fights? What? Did you watch any? No, I never 
watched any. We never did mingle among them at all.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.408
Do you remember where they came from? Mexico.

29:19.872 --> 29:23.978
How did your grandfather Vogel get a hold of them? 
Sometimes they'd send some Mexicans from here to

29:24.038 --> 29:31.849
Mexico to get workers, you know, give them money 
enough to go down over there and get some, you know.

29:32.109 --> 29:34.653
Your grandfather would trust them with the money 
to go down there? I guess so. He'd go down and get

29:36.275 --> 29:38.338
some and bring them back. The only way they paid 
them first was after they got here. I don't know

29:40.954 --> 29:43.438
what they've done now. But they did work this 
thing. They'd bring the whole family along. In the

29:49.386 --> 30:03.247
summertime, during cotton picking season, you 
know, late summer and fall, the mines, they had to

29:49.386 --> 30:03.247
pay a little more, you know, to dig coal. I remember 
some of them asking quick, you know, Three or four

30:06.685 --> 30:10.588
kids, you know, they said they could make more 
money picking cotton, you know. They had to, in the

30:10.929 --> 30:14.852
summer, pay a little more, raise the wages, you 
know. So they started the mine. Some of them had

30:16.394 --> 30:22.759
three or four kids, and they said they could make 
more money to take the kids, the whole family,

30:16.394 --> 30:22.759
picking cotton, you know. Yet they had to give a 
little more during that sea of cotton-picking

30:22.979 --> 30:28.244
time. They wouldn't all stay out there at one mine. 
They'd change around. They'd move out, go to

30:33.789 --> 30:36.051
another mine. Why would they do that, Louise? 
Sometimes they'd owe money. They'd quickly leave

30:40.645 --> 30:43.327
out, you know, someone. I see. So another mind 
might pay more than your grandfather's mind.

30:47.111 --> 30:47.411
Yeah, yeah. It's like we do these days. Yeah. 
Somebody might pay you more if you go to work for the

30:50.013 --> 30:53.737
other man too. It's the same way. One day they go to 
work, you know, and there's like here, I guess

30:56.039 --> 31:04.486
you'd call it burglar, ain't it? They took 
sledgehammer stuff and Knocked all that brass

31:06.575 --> 31:13.245
off, you know, off the machinery, pipes and stuff. 
They had to close down for about two days before

31:13.265 --> 31:17.432
they could go to work again. You know what I mean? 
Yeah, that happened at Jeremiah's? At the

31:20.357 --> 31:21.138
brickyard, yeah. At the brickyard, right. 
Knocked that brass off, you know. Did your grandpa

31:27.227 --> 31:31.875
have any labor problems? Were there ever any 
strikes? No. I don't know. We didn't even know what

31:35.668 --> 31:37.672
a strike was. No, they didn't have no strikes. They 
didn't have no trouble. If the Mexican didn't like

31:42.623 --> 31:45.209
it, they'd just quit and leave, you know. They'd 
get some more, you know. They'd get some more. Like

31:49.919 --> 31:53.727
I said, they'd sometimes need some workers, you 
know.
