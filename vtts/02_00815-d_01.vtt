00:01.634 --> 00:06.259
1983, 1985 biennium.

00:08.401 --> 00:30.004
It was gratifying to look back over the past 10 
years and realize that I had passed five

00:08.401 --> 00:30.004
general appropriations bills in the Texas House 
and carried them to the conference committee with

00:08.401 --> 00:30.004
the Senate. and it spanned a decade from 1975 to 
1985.

00:38.197 --> 00:54.381
Maybe the only decade in the history of Texas where 
there was never a special session on the

00:38.197 --> 00:54.381
appropriations bill and that there was no tax 
increase during that time. There was an

00:56.564 --> 00:58.827
elimination of taxes.

01:04.347 --> 01:09.452
We removed the sales tax on utilities. Being a 
graduate of Texas A&M, a former employee of A&M,

01:11.554 --> 01:27.531
and residing in Bryan College Station, I know that 
during that 10-year period I was perceived as

01:28.490 --> 01:30.373
champion for higher education.

01:32.836 --> 01:40.987
Life somewhat more uncomfortable than if I had had 
a different background and lived in a different

01:32.836 --> 01:40.987
location. For years during the the decade 1975 to 
85 that we were dealing with double-digit

01:42.349 --> 01:51.662
inflation and rapid enrollments in all of our 
programs, including higher education, and an

01:53.448 --> 02:05.624
increase in population in the state.

02:08.347 --> 02:19.101
I am proud of the support that I was able to give 
higher education as a whole and Texas A&M

02:08.347 --> 02:19.101
University System in particular. And 
statistically speaking, higher education did

02:20.228 --> 02:28.746
fare well, but so did all of state government. M 
University, for example, during that 10-year

02:30.329 --> 02:38.727
period, 1975 to 85, had almost a 500% increase in 
general revenue appropriations, modest of any

02:38.943 --> 02:57.083
increases in any of the tuition and fees during 
that period, while experiencing an enrollment

02:38.943 --> 02:57.083
increase of 67%.

03:02.209 --> 03:06.013
However, all of state government increased its 
appropriations during that same period almost

03:06.466 --> 03:15.421
eight times, 800 percent. Factoring out 
population and enrollment increases and

03:16.703 --> 03:26.719
inflation indicates

03:27.560 --> 03:39.238
a rather flat enrollment during this period or 
flat appropriations during this period for both

03:27.560 --> 03:39.238
higher education and all of Texas state 
government. I was proud of the achievements that

03:41.221 --> 03:51.677
we had made and it probably opened the door to other 
opportunities. One time I had considered an

03:52.467 --> 04:02.042
appointment to a statewide office where there was 
a resignation. Resignations occur, the governor

04:03.224 --> 04:07.691
makes those appointments. And I had first asked 
the governor to consider me and had my name

04:15.687 --> 04:31.527
withdrawn because of the fact that I was chairman 
of the House Appropriations Committee and want to

04:15.687 --> 04:31.527
disrupt the appropriations process by having to 
resign during a regular session. So about this

04:32.748 --> 04:38.235
time that I was asked to consider a run for the U.S. 
Congress, the opportunity was there since we had

04:39.548 --> 04:48.222
an open seat in our local congressional district.

04:55.353 --> 05:00.983
I knew enough about serving in Congress that it was 
something that did not appeal to me at all. I would

05:02.946 --> 05:06.231
have been willing to stay in the Texas legislature 
and could have served for years to come as chairman

05:07.156 --> 05:14.966
of the House Appropriations Committee.

05:17.870 --> 05:26.923
But with a paycheck of approximately $300 a month, 
it just did not have its financial rewards. The

05:28.405 --> 05:33.231
Texas legislature, during the time I served,

05:35.776 --> 05:51.957
provided adequately for office expenses and 
travel, but has a rather your salary for the time

05:35.776 --> 05:51.957
that it takes to serve. We're fortunate in Texas to 
provide adequately for our legislators as far as

05:53.179 --> 06:03.032
their office holder requirements are concerned. 
But there is a desperate need to increase the

06:03.603 --> 06:16.254
salary to at least cover the part time that one 
spends serving in the legislature. I do not favor a

06:18.296 --> 06:32.749
full time salaried position in the legislature, 
but a person should be adequately compensated for

06:18.296 --> 06:32.749
the time that it takes and for the time that he 
spends.

06:35.294 --> 06:52.510
In 1983, there was a considerable oil and gas play 
in Brazos County, and as a landowner, I stood to

06:35.294 --> 06:52.510
benefit

06:35.294 --> 06:52.510
from the oil and gas play through royalty income on 
my property. Very fortunate to be able to lease all

06:58.038 --> 07:06.329
of the land that I owned and have it all drilled. The 
income from the flush production in 83 and then

07:08.172 --> 07:20.168
later in 84 was very good but it was of concern to me 
that this would not last. No one knew whether the

07:24.436 --> 07:34.426
wells that were being drilled in Brazos County 
would have much longevity. And I did not feel like

07:35.788 --> 07:43.015
it was fair to my family to depend on that income for 
the future. Out that it was rather short-lived

07:44.837 --> 07:49.902
production But it was nice while it lasted.
