WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:07.699
on April 24th with, sorry, what's your first name? 
Mr. Menke, or you could say Gary Menke. Okay, Gary

00:09.641 --> 00:11.564
Menke, PhD. Correct. Okay.

00:17.491 --> 00:20.595
Over there. Okay. Hey, first off, can you just tell 
me a little background about yourself? Where were

00:25.201 --> 00:30.068
you born, your parents, education, things like 
that? Okay. I was born in Cumberland, Maryland in

00:30.642 --> 00:35.488
1940. I'm the son of a regional game warden for the 
state of Maryland. And my mother was an insurance

00:43.116 --> 00:55.931
salesperson, or I guess a secretary that worked in 
an insurance office. So I grew up on the East Coast

00:55.951 --> 00:59.535
in Maryland. and went to school at West Virginia 
University, where I got a master's degree. And

01:08.160 --> 01:12.164
then after my master's degree, I went in the Peace 
Corps. And when I came back from the Peace Corps, I

01:12.184 --> 01:16.810
went to get a Ph.D. at the University of Missouri.

01:20.094 --> 01:24.840
Okay, so you grew up mostly in Maryland? Right.

01:29.182 --> 01:34.971
Okay, what were your motives or influences that 
caused you to join the Peace Corps? Well, first

01:34.991 --> 01:41.380
off, I was intrigued with the idea when the Peace 
Corps notion first came out. I guess it was a Hubert

01:41.941 --> 01:58.446
Humphrey idea that was caught by Jack Kennedy, and 
he had a lot of real magnetism and dynamism, and he

01:41.941 --> 01:58.446
really invigorated a lot of young people. And my 
sister went in the Peace Corps, I guess, in one of

01:58.730 --> 02:04.960
the first phases of it. And she spent two years in 
Tanzania. And she was very successful in that

02:08.825 --> 02:13.873
operation. So she decided to re-up for a second two 
years. And the time she was going for her second two

02:18.400 --> 02:27.454
years, my roommate, Richard Rodman, was thinking 
about the Peace Corps. He was doing some graduate

02:30.045 --> 02:39.958
studies at West Virginia University and he went in 
the Peace Corps and went to Ecuador. So I was

02:40.418 --> 02:47.047
getting letters from Rodman and I was also getting 
letters from my sister. And so I was, you know,

02:48.189 --> 02:53.796
pretty well plugged into what was going on with the 
Peace Corps. So when I graduated with my master's

02:54.232 --> 03:03.653
degree, I thought, well, I couldn't really decide 
whether I wanted to teach or not. And then came this

03:04.455 --> 03:12.392
opportunity to do a university education program 
that Bolivia wanted and so I said you know this is a

03:12.878 --> 03:28.138
good opportunity to teach actually with the 
master's degree and then if I decide that you know

03:12.878 --> 03:28.138
that's something that I want to pursue as a career 
that I can go back and get a PhD. You mentioned about

03:30.000 --> 03:32.984
the effect of JFK had on your decision. Can you 
expand a little bit on that? Okay, well Jack

03:35.527 --> 03:41.755
Kennedy of course in his challenge to all 
Americans to ask not what their country can do for

03:42.578 --> 03:52.611
them but what they can do for their country. I think 
that people started thinking outwardly and so it

03:52.671 --> 04:11.556
was something that challenged all of us and I think 
it perhaps gave us a little bit more of the zeal to

03:52.671 --> 04:11.556
look for new opportunities and When he was killed, 
I guess, Lyndon Johnson took over, and that's

04:11.958 --> 04:25.511
about the time when I went into the B squad.

04:25.531 --> 04:31.917
Okay.

04:32.577 --> 04:38.843
Did you use these skills you got from your 
education you were mentioning? Were you asked to

04:39.076 --> 04:46.344
do something that was relative to that, or was it a 
task totally different from what you were trained

04:39.076 --> 04:46.344
to do? No, I used, of course, all my university 
education. It was both a teaching job and using

04:50.649 --> 05:01.641
some of the training that I had as a a geologist. I 
had a master's degree in geology with a minor in

05:04.120 --> 05:11.390
math. So I decided to. And what they wanted at the 
University of San Andres in La Paz, Bolivia, they

05:14.634 --> 05:25.107
were interested in several courses. And so I 
taught two geology courses, and I taught a couple

05:25.287 --> 05:31.375
of math courses. to high school

05:31.692 --> 05:39.884
students who were preparing for college. They 
were getting ready to take their university

05:39.944 --> 05:48.137
entrance exams. And so I taught in a night school 
English and two math courses to help them in their

05:48.958 --> 06:00.535
preparatory to the year. entrance exams. Did you 
speak Spanish before you left? I had 12 hours of

06:05.168 --> 06:21.072
college Spanish, and what we did in the first part 
of the Peace Corps is that we actually kind of

06:05.168 --> 06:21.072
immersed ourselves in Spanish, did about five 
hours of Spanish a day. And then we went off to the

06:21.507 --> 06:28.936
Olympic Peninsula and actually did some practice 
teaching in Spanish. And then as soon as we got in

06:28.956 --> 06:36.124
country, it was a little while before the actual 
school program started. So for that first six

06:36.144 --> 06:50.080
months while we were getting involved in the 
universities, learning the system, we were also

06:36.144 --> 06:50.080
taking private tutor lessons in country. and 
living with Bolivian families where we had to

06:50.549 --> 06:55.735
continually speak. So by the time we had to begin 
teaching in Spanish, we were fairly well

06:55.755 --> 07:03.583
prepared.

07:06.106 --> 07:08.108
You mentioned you went to Bolivia. Where else were 
you sent in your stay in the Peace Corps? That was

07:11.151 --> 07:11.712
it. We spent two years in Bolivia. I say we. the 
woman that I eventually married were in the same

07:16.418 --> 07:26.568
Peace Corps training program, and so we were both 
down there together. Did you all request to go to

07:27.989 --> 07:30.932
Bolivia together? No, we separately were 
thinking about the Peace Corps and just happened

07:32.854 --> 07:46.307
to, I didn't actually know her before Peace Corps 
training, so we met in Peace Corps training at the

07:46.642 --> 07:54.673
University of Washington in Seattle. But did you 
request Bolivia, you personally? No. No, it was

07:59.199 --> 08:09.072
just I had written to the Peace Corps and said that I 
would be interested in information about new

07:59.199 --> 08:09.072
programs coming out. And the summer after I got my 
master's degree, they wrote to me and said we've

08:15.262 --> 08:22.653
got a program just starting up and we're prepared 
to wire you tickets if you want to join the program.

08:23.654 --> 08:34.890
So it was something I had to make a decision pretty 
quickly because I also had a summer job lined up

08:23.654 --> 08:34.890
with Shell Oil Company that summer and so it was 
kind of difficult to make that decision, but it was

08:35.360 --> 08:47.380
something that I wanted to do, so I had to cancel one 
job and quickly change gears and get into the other

08:35.360 --> 08:47.380
one. What year was that that you started? That was 
in 1964. And that was the first year of the Peace

08:51.647 --> 08:53.190
Corps? No, it had started, I think, already in 
about 1960 or 61. just after Jack Kennedy took

09:01.347 --> 09:04.511
office. So I think it was perhaps 60 or 61 that it 
really started. So I was in the sort of the second or

09:12.021 --> 09:21.874
third bunch of Peace Corps volunteers. Had 
already been one group of Peace Corps volunteers

09:21.894 --> 09:29.785
in Bolivia by the time

09:21.894 --> 09:29.785
we got there. Was there any other reason that 
motivated you to join? Did you get draft deferment

09:32.946 --> 09:37.010
by doing this, or anything like that? Well, I was 
not assured that you would have draft deferment.

09:41.936 --> 09:58.995
At that time, there was some buildup of, actually, 
we hadn't started building up in Vietnam yet,

09:41.936 --> 09:58.995
because that was during the first years when 
Johnson took over. We did have advisors over

09:59.296 --> 10:10.796
there, and it was not certain whether people were 
going to get deferments for being in Peace Corps

09:59.296 --> 10:10.796
service. Certainly if you didn't make the 
program, I mean, it was not assured just when you

10:12.379 --> 10:19.431
went into Peace Corps training. that you were 
going to be able to make the grade and actually be

10:19.799 --> 10:25.748
what they were looking for. So obviously, if you 
didn't succeed in the training program and you

10:25.768 --> 10:43.955
weren't selected to do your in-country work, then 
of course you would lose any chance of having a

10:25.768 --> 10:43.955
deferment. But that wasn't a motivating factor. 
It was just something that... The opportunity

10:48.740 --> 11:11.512
came at the right moment for me just after I 
graduated and actually had to, like I say, decide

10:48.740 --> 11:11.512
not to take a summer job with an oil company, which 
was a very interesting one and would have been an

10:48.740 --> 11:11.512
also exciting thing to do. What was your 
relationship like with your locals and how did you

11:11.832 --> 11:16.519
find the culture?

11:19.402 --> 11:25.652
Well, we took some Bolivian cultural training at 
the University of Washington. We had actually

11:26.113 --> 11:28.697
some Bolivians there. We had a lot of Latin 
Americans that were on the staff. And we had some

11:32.123 --> 11:40.296
Mexicans, some Argentines, and some Bolivians, 
and some Ecuadorians that were part of the

11:40.698 --> 11:45.404
instructors in the training program. And of 
course, they helped us to prepare what the country

11:46.225 --> 11:52.833
was going to be like, what the culture was going to 
be like. And of course, you're never fully

11:53.073 --> 11:57.158
prepared. But I think when we first got there, the 
biggest distraction was that a revolution very

11:57.378 --> 12:10.114
quickly broke out. president of the country, 
Victor Paz Estensoro, at the time was required to

12:10.246 --> 12:28.284
actually leave the country for his own protection 
and there was a lot of heavy fighting that went on.

12:29.666 --> 12:36.793
And so that also slowed down our initial 
involvement in the country because There were

12:37.145 --> 12:43.551
some snipers inside the university, and the 
university got machine guns several times. And

12:43.691 --> 12:58.285
there was a lot of damage that had to be repaired and 
a lot of political turmoil that had to be quelled

12:43.691 --> 12:58.285
and calmed down before things went back to normal. 
So it kind of made it a difficult situation to start

12:58.305 --> 13:05.312
into. and there was also a curfew that was put on, so 
you couldn't get around too much in the evenings,

13:05.883 --> 13:29.873
and so it made it a little more difficult to 
actually see the

13:05.883 --> 13:29.873
city, and you had to do everything during the 
daytime hours. And you were in La Paz, is that

13:29.893 --> 13:31.835
right? Uh-huh, in La Paz. What about with the 
locals in the city? How did they treat you? We were

13:41.421 --> 13:47.689
treated generally with pretty much respect. We 
lived with the Bolivian family

13:49.231 --> 14:05.893
and I think they were curious about Americans and 
so I think they wanted to learn as much about us as we

13:49.231 --> 14:05.893
wanted to learn about them. And it was also very 
helpful because when we had difficult questions

14:06.329 --> 14:32.149
to ask them about anything that was happening in 
the culture, how should we react to different

14:06.329 --> 14:32.149
situations, we could just go and explain it to 
them, and they would be almost like our foster

14:06.329 --> 14:32.149
guardians, and they could kind of tell us the best 
way to act or the best way to handle the situations.

14:32.870 --> 14:35.053
So I think that was, you know, good for both sides.

14:40.347 --> 14:44.711
You mentioned the difference in culture that 
you'd have to go and ask them about. What were some

14:45.212 --> 14:55.941
of the customs that you found kind of strange or 
different from the local customs you were

14:45.212 --> 14:55.941
familiar with? Just for example. Well, let's see.

15:02.968 --> 15:03.488
I think A lot of the things that you're not quite 
used to, like, for example, when just something

15:03.822 --> 15:30.133
that you want to get in line for a bus, get onto a bus, 
or if you want to go to a movie, it's our culture that

15:03.822 --> 15:30.133
we go, we stand in line, everything is orderly. 
Sometimes this doesn't happen. In places like

15:32.400 --> 15:49.243
Bolivia, you get there and you find out that the way 
to form a waiting group for your ticket is to be in a

15:32.400 --> 15:49.243
semicircle and everybody reaching around. And so 
this is kind of annoying and disturbing to

15:49.343 --> 15:57.775
somebody who doesn't understand the culture.

15:58.227 --> 16:02.933
It's something, I guess, that we got to learn to get 
used to. You don't want to generate

16:03.013 --> 16:08.841
confrontations out of these things. At the same 
time, you don't want to just stand back and, you

16:08.921 --> 16:21.258
know, feel like that you're not going to get your 
fair opportunity to do things. So that was

16:21.278 --> 16:27.306
certainly one instance.

16:27.843 --> 16:49.969
The teaching role itself, I think there's a lot of, 
I wouldn't call them necessarily discipline

16:27.843 --> 16:49.969
problems, but they certainly do like to challenge 
the teachers and professors, and particularly if

16:27.843 --> 16:49.969
they feel that you're somewhat of a curiosity then 
you know they may decide to do things like call

16:50.438 --> 17:14.944
boycotts of classes and then when you confront 
them about you know why they did this well you know

16:50.438 --> 17:14.944
they would come up with some kind of excuse like 
well there's American involvement in the

16:50.438 --> 17:14.944
Dominican Republic and so We're protesting. Now, 
mind you, we don't have anything against you

17:16.954 --> 17:25.671
personally, but we're kind of just trying to 
demonstrate against that kind of thing. So you

17:26.111 --> 17:34.107
never knew whether it was a serious thing or 
whether they were just taking advantage of the

17:26.111 --> 17:34.107
situation. So these were the things that we... We 
had to learn how to deal with them. It was mainly

17:41.637 --> 17:52.769
through talking to your counterparts in the 
university and other professors and say, what

17:41.637 --> 17:52.769
should we do? How should we handle it? So that's 
basically some of the differences, I guess. What

18:00.357 --> 18:03.260
did they say when you asked the department? Well, a 
lot of times, they realized You know, there are

18:07.844 --> 18:15.514
these times when political activism does take 
over. And like I said, there had just been a

18:15.534 --> 18:17.616
revolution. So everybody was a little bit on 
tender hooks and didn't want to really stir up more

18:18.077 --> 18:30.392
activity than they thought was necessary. We're 
just going to have to learn to maximize the time we

18:30.963 --> 18:36.730
do have with the students. If we create an 
environment where they think that it's valuable

18:38.552 --> 18:48.223
to come to class, then they will. So I think that's 
what we try to do. I guess it worked out. Did you find

18:56.056 --> 19:01.945
any friction between the Spanish Catholics and 
the indigenous peoples, the Indians?

19:04.569 --> 19:23.937
As far as I could recognize, I guess the only real 
conflicts probably were not between people that

19:04.569 --> 19:23.937
weren't Catholics necessarily, but they did have 
what they called the evangelicals. And these

19:24.440 --> 19:33.133
would be some of the other missionaries that are 
doing work there. And most of the Indians that we

19:33.194 --> 19:46.614
were involved with were actually converted to 
Catholicism.

19:47.736 --> 19:52.303
There were sometimes some I suppose you would say 
competition between the various missionary

19:53.735 --> 20:01.588
groups that were working there. But as far as we 
could tell, there was never any real hostility

20:04.112 --> 20:18.595
that came about because of religions.

20:18.743 --> 20:31.277
there were a few Catholics that were in our Peace 
Corps group, and others were, you know, I guess

20:18.743 --> 20:31.277
different religions, and it really never seemed 
to be an issue.

20:34.400 --> 20:34.620
Okay. What was your daily routine like?

20:40.307 --> 20:46.253
Daily routine was, I guess, pretty much the same as 
a routine for any professor in the U.S. We were

20:46.621 --> 21:14.485
preparing lesson plans and we would

20:46.621 --> 21:14.485
I guess one thing that was kind of different is they 
had kind of a practice of taking their little early

20:46.621 --> 21:14.485
morning breaks, well not necessarily early 
morning, but generally sometime around 10

20:46.621 --> 21:14.485
o'clock they would take some kind of our coffee 
break, we'd call it a coffee break, and there they

21:14.802 --> 21:41.738
would take some time out to have what they called 
the saltinas, which were kind of little

21:14.802 --> 21:41.738
empanadas, and then they would have their drink, 
which they called api, which is kind of like a

21:14.802 --> 21:41.738
purple corn, hot corn drink. And so it was kind of 
unusual, but we got to really liking this little

21:42.224 --> 21:55.461
break that we would take at about 10 o'clock. And 
you'd sit in a little cafe or something, and then

21:55.522 --> 22:03.332
you could talk about different situations. And 
it's almost like going into a faculty lounge or

22:03.432 --> 22:09.480
something like that. The difference was that 
after your classes were over, La

22:09.713 --> 22:24.393
Paz is actually at about 12,000 feet. So it gets 
really quite cool in the evenings. And you found

22:28.319 --> 22:38.893
out that there was no central heat in the houses.

22:39.194 --> 23:03.531
there wasn't a lot of refrigeration space or 
anything like that so you wound up basically going

22:39.194 --> 23:03.531
to the open markets after your classes were over 
and you had to buy your food that you were going to

22:39.194 --> 23:03.531
prepare for your evening meal and generally you 
just kind of lived from buying for that day or maybe

23:03.848 --> 23:09.233
for the morning or the next day. So you sort of 
bought food for about two days at a time and you

23:09.253 --> 23:17.761
didn't have really any way to preserve it or store 
it. So you sort of bought in limited quantities and

23:17.881 --> 23:27.410
used it quickly.

23:27.631 --> 23:32.235
And then of course you would start to work on your 
either grading papers or preparing for next day's

23:32.772 --> 23:40.963
teaching assignment. Sometimes you would also be 
teaching night classes. So we had these high

23:47.052 --> 23:59.369
school kids from Tupac Atari night school that 
were preparing for college entrance exams, which

23:47.052 --> 23:59.369
they called the cursos visticulares. And so we 
would get ready to go over and teach them. Also, we

24:05.970 --> 24:22.106
had some blind girls, the Ciegitas, which they 
were sort of personal friends of one of the people

24:05.970 --> 24:22.106
that we met there. And so we decided to go over and 
spend some time with them. They were actually

24:29.152 --> 24:32.357
quite good singers. And as it turns out, later on 
when we got married, as kind of paying us back for

24:32.978 --> 24:47.321
the time that we spent, they actually came and sang 
at our wedding. And so we had a recording of their

24:47.341 --> 24:53.030
singing at our wedding. It was really pretty 
special to us. That's a good transition, because

24:55.578 --> 25:02.066
my next question was, what was it like being 
married in the Peace Corps? Well, I guess being

25:02.086 --> 25:24.252
married in the Peace Corps is like being married 
anywhere, but certainly it was a very different

25:02.086 --> 25:24.252
situation to be married in a big Latin American 
church where you knew very few people, and yet the

25:02.086 --> 25:24.252
church was actually packed. We had the whole 
square that was filling up, and the buzz word was

25:24.839 --> 25:35.654
going around that there was a gringo wedding that 
was going to take place. And so when it came time to

25:36.375 --> 25:44.707
actually have the wedding ceremony, the whole 
church was filled. This was a church that was a big,

25:45.208 --> 25:54.441
high vaulted church with a very ornate altar and 
everything. The floor of the church was actually

25:54.691 --> 25:58.036
dirt. It was a dirt floor. In the tape of the 
wedding, you could actually hear some of the

25:59.659 --> 26:15.623
people sucking on oranges or some of them might be 
nursing children or whatever. So it was really

26:16.525 --> 26:23.095
quite a different setting for a wedding. And, of 
course, most of the ceremonies there were all, of

26:23.767 --> 26:34.399
course, in Spanish, so that also made it quite 
different. But La Paz, you know, being very high,

26:34.419 --> 26:52.238
surrounded by mountains with snow-capped peaks, 
and it's a really very picturesque-type setting,

26:34.419 --> 26:52.238
and, of course, It's just something very special 
to us to have all these sort of very different kinds

26:52.673 --> 27:09.659
of memories about our early experiences

26:52.673 --> 27:09.659
there. Are we going to say something? Well, of 
course. Being married in a foreign country and not

27:14.088 --> 27:34.611
having all the conveniences that you would have if 
you were starting off in the U.S., I guess it made it

27:14.088 --> 27:34.611
more challenging because just for simple things 
like cooking, It was quite challenging to prepare

27:35.570 --> 27:54.153
a meal on just two little hot plate burners, not 
having any storage facilities, and then simple

27:35.570 --> 27:54.153
things like taking a bath with really no hot water. 
You had to heat the water on the stove and then mix in

27:54.193 --> 28:01.982
a bucket with cold water to get it sort of warm. And 
then you splash that on yourself in order to take

28:02.317 --> 28:07.022
baths. So that was certainly a challenging thing. 
Most young people just getting married would

28:11.107 --> 28:22.440
probably find that kind of living rather 
challenging too. Did either of your parents find?

28:25.063 --> 28:25.303
No. We have no one from either one of our families 
that was there. That was one of the things, I guess,

28:31.730 --> 28:39.560
that also made it more of an isolated thing. We did 
send them the tape of our wedding ceremony, which I

28:40.761 --> 28:49.552
guess was something. But still, other than the 
pictures and the tape, they had to certainly

28:49.572 --> 29:00.285
experience it all vicariously from our accounts 
of it.

29:03.488 --> 29:06.652
Were they very upset about that? It wasn't like you 
eloped or anything? No, I guess they realized that

29:10.236 --> 29:24.654
both of us were doing things that they probably 
wouldn't have considered at the time when they

29:10.236 --> 29:24.654
were growing up. To go off and go to a foreign 
country and to get married in that foreign country

29:24.954 --> 29:31.082
and so forth. I guess was probably pretty foreign 
to

29:31.433 --> 29:44.426
try to actually plan to go and attend the wedding. I 
guess it was probably more than we could arrange.

29:50.412 --> 29:56.418
Certainly my parents would never think of getting 
on an airplane and flying to a foreign country. So I

29:56.438 --> 30:00.782
guess that was just kind of out of the question. 
Y'all had your first child when you were in the

30:02.669 --> 30:05.994
Peace Corps. Yes, our first child, David, was born 
at the end of our Peace Corps term there. So shortly

30:16.710 --> 30:29.750
after, he was born in April, I guess, and our Peace 
Corps two-year period ended in, I think it was

30:16.710 --> 30:29.750
September? I guess it was June. And so we just had a 
few months there where we were also. But it was kind

30:41.617 --> 30:44.901
of interesting. My wife, Joy, was pregnant at the 
time she was finishing her teaching assignment at

30:46.423 --> 31:01.701
the University of La Paz, or San Andres in La Paz, 
Bolivia. It just turns out that the day that she

31:02.086 --> 31:11.717
turned in her final grades for the classes, I guess 
the baby was born the next day. So I guess that was

31:11.957 --> 31:15.741
pretty good timing. What were the hospital 
facilities like? Well, the hospital facilities

31:19.005 --> 31:27.034
were certainly, I guess you would say, 
challenging.

31:28.576 --> 31:30.338
She had the baby. which is a very little missionary 
hospital. There was one missionary doctor there.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.606
It was Dr. Thompson, I think.
