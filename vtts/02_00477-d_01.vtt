WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:06.947
So basically what you were going to do is get right 
in the middle. You were going to take your tanks. I

00:08.829 --> 00:14.837
was going to go in right after dark when they're 
going through this town and going on across the

00:08.829 --> 00:14.837
bridge. I'm coming in right in behind them and 
follow them right across the bridge. Wouldn't

00:22.407 --> 00:24.269
they know that you weren't one of them? Not 
necessarily. Why not? Because they're moving,

00:26.752 --> 00:32.439
you know, and a tank is a tank, you know, in the dark. 
Uh-huh. You see? Well, wouldn't the last tank,

00:34.830 --> 00:38.655
wouldn't he know that he was supposed to be the 
last? He doesn't know. The rear end has been cut up

00:39.917 --> 00:42.360
back there. As far as he knows, there's another 
hundreds of them behind him. I'm going to be those

00:48.368 --> 00:50.291
vehicles. Jim Starr is going to cut the tail off his 
column and start shooting the hell out of them out

00:50.371 --> 00:55.858
there. Well, we got into town. And we got in the 
damnedest knockdown and brawl you have ever seen.

01:03.659 --> 01:07.183
We were shooting each other up at 20 feet. At 20 
feet? 20 feet. Here comes a tank. Here comes a tank

01:11.428 --> 01:23.161
around this corner of the building here, and I'm 
right there, and I'm killing him there, and he's

01:11.428 --> 01:23.161
shooting at my guys over here and back and forth, 
and it is a shambles. Ended up that they started

01:23.721 --> 01:29.067
giving up, and... I ended up down just at the face of 
the bridge with a Panzerfaust busted in my face off

01:29.468 --> 01:48.251
the cobblestone, cut all the way through here, 
through here, all through here, piece resting

01:29.468 --> 01:48.251
against a jugular vein, machine pistol bullet in 
the knee. And you were inside the tank? I was out on

01:51.034 --> 01:54.058
the ground leading the tranq on foot with 
infantry. because you're in close quarters in the

01:55.186 --> 02:04.496
village, I mean in the town, so you've got to get out 
of that on foot.

02:04.556 --> 02:06.237
How can you even shoot that close? Huh? How can you 
even shoot a tank that close? Bang, point blank.

02:11.943 --> 02:13.825
Oh, yeah. One tank shot another one in the rear from 
about five or six feet. One of my tanks shot a

02:22.844 --> 02:24.486
German. This German comes squealing out in front 
of him in the street, and he just, German come out

02:25.067 --> 02:45.318
like that, and by the time my gunner could shoot, I 
can't remember, I think it was one of them, Jack

02:25.067 --> 02:45.318
Knight, Jack Knight's company, Jack Knight had 
one of them. He just shot him right in the rear and

02:45.338 --> 02:47.722
set it on fire. The town was all on fire. By this 
time, I mean, my God, we were shooting each other up

02:49.878 --> 02:55.485
in there. And they blew the damn bridge on us. Oh, 
they did? Yeah. Blew the damn bridge on us. How many

03:01.933 --> 03:03.154
tanks did you lose? I

03:03.174 --> 03:08.240
don't know. I didn't have anybody killed. I think I 
was the most seriously wounded.

03:16.450 --> 03:17.151
And, uh, I might have had a couple of things with 
tracks and stuff blown off of them, but I didn't

03:19.375 --> 03:25.123
have any total losses. Germans were, at this point 
of war, their fighting capability had

03:26.445 --> 03:36.980
deteriorated to the point where it was a heyday for 
me, you see. And they were trying to get away from

03:37.260 --> 03:39.103
you. Oh, hell, they didn't want to fight. They 
wanted to get away. And they only fight because of

03:42.494 --> 03:46.519
honor and because they thought I was going to kill 
them all. They said, well, hell, I might as well try

03:46.579 --> 03:48.722
to kill him. He's going to try to kill me. I wasn't 
going to try to kill him unless he fired first

03:49.944 --> 03:53.829
because what the hell do you get out of that? So you 
were hoping when you went into that town that

03:55.391 --> 03:58.555
they'd surrender? Yeah, and they did after they'd 
fired several shots, but I wanted that bridge. But

04:06.102 --> 04:11.770
hell, if I could have got that bridge, I just 
probably said to hell with Eisenhower and

04:06.102 --> 04:11.770
everybody else. And this might have been a very 
historical case of the commander not having

04:12.070 --> 04:25.970
received word and damn if he didn't stagger in and 
take Berlin. Now you're going to withdraw him or

04:26.010 --> 04:28.413
what are you going to do? And what a hell of an 
episode that had made in the history of the world.

04:34.021 --> 04:34.101
Huh? Isn't that something? I wanted that bridge, 
and nobody said I couldn't take it. The division

04:40.964 --> 04:48.634
commander had said, grab the bridge on the Elbe.

04:48.654 --> 04:50.776
That, to me, went, he's going on to Berlin. We had no 
idea then that we weren't going to Berlin. That was

04:55.802 --> 04:58.566
the name of the game, to get the war over.

05:03.852 --> 05:04.493
So... So tell me about your wound. Were you sent 
back? I was sent back to the 4th Station Hospital in

05:08.577 --> 05:16.568
country and I talked my way out of there in a few 
days. What was wrong with you? I had been cut, this

05:19.512 --> 05:25.380
lip had been cut all the way through, all the way 
through to my teeth. I had been cut in here above my

05:27.062 --> 05:30.447
eye. This is a shell fragment from that rocket that 
they fired at the tank, and I was out in front of the

05:31.405 --> 05:41.958
tank, and there was a piece against the jugular 
vein. I was just bleeding a lot, mad. It just cut

05:45.102 --> 05:56.637
that wide open and cut down through here on my chin, 
and I guess I'd been all right except until that

05:57.157 --> 06:03.002
machine pistol bullet hit me in the knee and then 
knocked me down. And the artillery battalion

06:03.042 --> 06:17.576
commander had gotten up then, it was about 
midnight, Colonel Berlin, a lieutenant colonel

06:03.042 --> 06:17.576
working for me. I was still a major then, I hadn't 
been promoted, I was on the list to get promoted in a

06:19.598 --> 06:25.223
matter of a few days. But he drug me up in a doorway 
and

06:26.671 --> 06:35.368
they put me on a jeep. I'd evacuate sometime during 
the night. And I went back and got patched up. This

06:43.565 --> 06:46.671
machine pistol bullet was in the cartilage. And 
they said, yeah, we'll just leave it there until it

06:47.292 --> 06:54.201
starts bothering you. It's still there today. 
It's still there. Machine pistol bullet, yeah.

06:58.427 --> 07:05.956
Small .25 caliber machine pistol bullet that they 
fired out of a window and knocked me down. It made me

07:06.617 --> 07:09.101
very unhappy.

07:12.665 --> 07:13.266
And, uh, That pretty much was it except I went back 
to my unit and then we withdrew to Brunswick. And

07:22.142 --> 07:25.807
then we waited until the Germans took Berlin. The 
Russians took Berlin. And then the 2nd Armored

07:29.692 --> 07:39.266
Division was the honored division to occupy 
Berlin first for the American forces. And that was

07:40.688 --> 07:44.653
in September and the division commander said to 
me, don't you think we've been over here about

07:45.730 --> 08:11.260
three years now don't you think it's time to go home 
and I said if you say so sir

07:45.730 --> 08:11.260
and he said well where do you want to go I said I do not 
know he said well I'll tell you where you're going

07:45.730 --> 08:11.260
I'm going to become the commandant of the cavalry 
school at General I.D. White and said, you're

08:12.410 --> 08:20.540
coming along to command a cavalry regiment, a 
mechanized cavalry regiment at Fort Riley,

08:12.410 --> 08:20.540
Kansas. He said, how do you like that? And I said, 
anything you say. So I came back home and I saw Mrs.

08:24.805 --> 08:33.475
Hollingsworth and our young son, who

08:24.805 --> 08:33.475
was born in 1942.

08:36.238 --> 08:40.543
And we spent four years at Fort Riley, Kansas. And

08:41.620 --> 08:54.619
I guess that

08:41.620 --> 08:54.619
ought to kind of wrap things up for today. Yes, 
that's a good place to stop for today. This is our

09:01.328 --> 09:03.932
second interview with General Hollingsworth.

09:06.933 --> 09:11.860
And last, yesterday, we left off right at the end of 
the Second World War. And I was wondering, at this

09:13.022 --> 09:22.376
time, were you interested in first going and 
fighting the Japanese? Or second, had you at while

09:26.896 --> 09:37.192
demobilization was taking place, had you started 
thinking about perhaps leaving the service, or

09:26.896 --> 09:37.192
had you made up your mind to have it occur by then? 
Let's start with a Japanese question. A Japanese

09:40.818 --> 09:52.617
question, uh, I think it resolved itself around 
the fact that, uh, I had been away from home almost

09:40.818 --> 09:52.617
three years, and, uh, I had been wounded a total of 
five times. I

09:58.123 --> 10:14.042
had been away from home almost three years in war in 
Africa and Sicily and all across Europe. As far as I

10:15.583 --> 10:19.448
was concerned, my part of the war was over. The 
Japanese conflict was still going on, and if I had

10:20.187 --> 10:38.212
been asked to go to assist

10:20.187 --> 10:38.212
in the final days of the war in the Pacific, I would 
have gone. I do believe that I felt some serious

10:38.232 --> 10:44.541
obligation to my family and I think that the Army 
would have had to ask me to go instead of me

10:45.584 --> 10:52.914
volunteering to go. I had one final wrap-up on the 
European

10:54.436 --> 11:05.150
conflict in World War II. I make reference to the 
last battle by Cornelius Ryan. We have not covered

11:14.879 --> 11:43.283
certain exploits in here which are authenticated 
and recorded in his book, so I refer you to that for

11:14.879 --> 11:43.283
some incidental battles such as

11:14.879 --> 11:43.283
I may have led the last charge

11:14.879 --> 11:43.283
with tanks in the history of our country and I

11:44.512 --> 11:56.871
recommend that to you for reference material. 
Would you explain what we were talking about

11:57.933 --> 12:06.807
yesterday on the Elbe?

12:07.681 --> 12:22.084
Other incidents where I lined up tanks on a reverse 
slope of a hill and charged heavy anti-tank guns as

12:07.681 --> 12:22.084
the old cavalry led the old cavalry charge. That 
detail is in the book and it can be read there.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.224
We were talking about the Japanese. The second 
question I believe you asked was had I given any

12:35.643 --> 12:44.091
thought and consideration to career. At that 
time, I had been honored with a distinguished

12:45.853 --> 13:04.992
service cross,

12:45.853 --> 13:04.992
four silver stars for gallantry, and four bronze 
stars for valour, and had been wounded five times,

12:45.853 --> 13:04.992
had five purple hearts, and was still alive and 
healthy so I had

13:06.389 --> 13:34.894
commanded a force of more than 3,000 people by the 
time I was 25 years old in battle and battle is a real

13:06.389 --> 13:34.894
test of man so I felt that I had met the test a man in 
the face of enemy fire on the battlefield and that

13:35.279 --> 13:59.363
if I'd been able to do that I felt that maybe I owed 
something more to my country by serving in the Army

13:35.279 --> 13:59.363
wherein I could further responsibility to my 
country and also for the training and leading of

14:01.216 --> 14:06.423
young men. And I know of no other, no other 
profession

14:07.785 --> 14:29.974
that allows a man who is interested in people, I 
know of no other profession that

14:07.785 --> 14:29.974
offers the opportunity that the Army does for 
leadership association with new people, the

14:30.460 --> 14:42.096
training, the building of them, the watching of 
them grow, and leading them in battle. And it's an

14:44.038 --> 14:46.361
awesome responsibility.

14:48.324 --> 14:58.037
When you think about, as I said yesterday, the 
responsibilities of an officer.

14:58.692 --> 15:21.877
assignment which I ended my career was in command 
of 250,000 men and responsible for the defense of a

14:58.692 --> 15:21.877
whole country and 37 million people I'm referring 
to the Republic of Korea. That's an awesome

15:23.899 --> 15:25.881
responsibility. with little compensation, with 
little compensation,

15:27.110 --> 15:35.919
money-wise, financially-wise. So, to live with 
that awesome responsibility on

15:37.601 --> 15:56.340
a meager salary is one hell of a sacrifice and one 
hell of a responsibility

15:37.601 --> 15:56.340
in which

15:58.328 --> 16:01.412
The United States Army provided me that 
opportunity. My country provided me that

16:02.674 --> 16:07.541
opportunity, and I shall be forever grateful. You 
never entertained the thought. While

16:10.585 --> 16:24.184
demobilization was going on in late 1945 and 
throughout 1946, it must have been somewhat of a

16:10.585 --> 16:24.184
discouraging episode career people? You never 
entertained the thought of leaving the service

16:25.346 --> 16:32.434
and going like most of them back to civilian life? I 
think that

16:32.454 --> 16:52.956
you evaluate all of the different

16:32.454 --> 16:52.956
aspects of life at a

16:32.454 --> 16:52.956
signal point in history, as was the case in which 
we're discussing at the end of World War II.

17:04.011 --> 17:11.880
I looked at several alternatives.

17:11.900 --> 17:23.112
The first one was to go to medical school because I 
thought that I could offer a service again to

17:11.900 --> 17:23.112
people because to me the only thing important in 
our world is people

17:24.880 --> 17:47.315
and a good physician who is dedicated to his 
profession provides a great service to people. I

17:47.335 --> 17:52.002
was offered without any assistance from anyone, I 
was offered a job to start out as a district manager

17:54.293 --> 18:08.975
of a metropolitan life insurance company in one of 
the largest cities here in Texas. And not knowing

18:11.439 --> 18:23.237
anything about the insurance business, I could 
not see myself on the street corner begging people

18:11.439 --> 18:23.237
to buy an insurance policy. And that was my outlook 
on the insurance business at that time.

18:32.574 --> 18:37.281
So I very quickly cast that away. General Motors, 
as a result of my experience in the field of

18:39.405 --> 18:47.757
maintenance, had made offers to me to go to 
Cadillac Motor Car Company who was building our

18:48.209 --> 18:54.817
light tanks and light anti-aircraft weapons at 
the time. I gave that serious thought, but then on

18:56.399 --> 19:15.702
the other hand, my thoughts come back to people and 
if I had been involved in General Motors, I would

18:56.399 --> 19:15.702
have been involved in the production of 
materialistic things. and materialistic things

19:17.707 --> 19:20.890
are not important. They can be made important only 
if they're used to enhance the welfare of people.

19:29.259 --> 19:46.718
So as a tank and an airplane and an artillery piece, 
it is a worthless piece of material

19:29.259 --> 19:46.718
if it's standing idle and isn't being used And we 
avoid that aspect of things during peacetime by

19:48.537 --> 20:01.374
using it to train soldiers so that when they go to 
battle they can live on the battlefield. So that's

20:01.474 --> 20:16.333
an example of my view of how to use a materialistic 
thing, make it important to enhance the welfare of

20:01.474 --> 20:16.333
an individual and the country.

20:16.583 --> 20:43.249
those auctions and I always came back to the 
profession that I had been successful to date with

20:16.583 --> 20:43.249
at that time and that was the military and I guess 
that Miss Hollingsworth

20:45.355 --> 20:48.279
It was a great encouragement to me. She said to me, 
whatever you decide to do, I will be right by your

20:48.299 --> 20:55.230
side. And when I said that I felt that our, the 
state, and the profession of arms, I believe she

20:55.811 --> 21:07.409
felt very confident about our future. I was 
wondering about another thing. In July of 1945,

21:14.853 --> 21:16.916
You were promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.

21:19.639 --> 21:35.560
Throughout the next year after the war was over, a 
number of officers lost rank, lost a grade, and

21:19.639 --> 21:35.560
that was almost pro-forma, but you didn't. You 
were one of the most junior Lieutenant Colonels in

21:36.722 --> 21:40.607
the Army, and you didn't lose you weren't demoted 
back to a major like why that's phenomenal why was

21:41.178 --> 22:09.328
that why did you maintain your colonelcy well out 
of

21:41.178 --> 22:09.328
some 15 to 20,000 or 30,000 that lost their rank 
1100

21:41.178 --> 22:09.328
of us retained our rank Out of 30,000, 1,100 stayed 
the same, right? Yes, 1,100.

22:16.883 --> 22:32.027
And I can't explain that except that

22:16.883 --> 22:32.027
maybe my record had something to do with it. I never 
did really know why. why they did not demote the

22:37.152 --> 22:46.420
1100, but of course we were very grateful for this. 
We had very low pay, but you know we never really

22:48.102 --> 23:05.117
gave that too much thought at the time,

22:48.102 --> 23:05.117
and we stayed in our Those 1100 stayed in that grade 
for a long, long time. Oh yeah, you were in that

23:09.620 --> 23:11.682
grade for 11 years. Yes, a long, long time.

23:16.246 --> 23:34.362
So,

23:16.246 --> 23:34.362
I guess that your war record and the honors

23:16.246 --> 23:34.362
that had been bestowed on you during those combat 
had a lot to do with it. Okay, let's now move to

23:37.024 --> 23:41.270
Talvery School. You were there from August 1945 
until July of 1949 in two different capacities,

23:42.833 --> 23:56.133
commanding officer of the school troops regiment 
and an instructor. Why were you an instructor

23:57.575 --> 24:03.083
second, commanding officer first?

24:04.835 --> 24:08.661
The commandant, General I.D. White, was my 
division commander, as I referred to earlier. And

24:13.968 --> 24:34.318
since I had been in command for a long time, one of 
the most difficult units to command in our

24:13.968 --> 24:34.318
military is a regiment or a battalion or a unit that 
supports the school. because of the great demands

24:35.851 --> 25:04.845
from all the instructors in the different 
departments, Department of Weapons, Department

24:35.851 --> 25:04.845
of Tactics, Department of Automotive, 
Department of Communication, Department of

24:35.851 --> 25:04.845
Electronics, all these departments and the 
department heads all placing demands on this

24:35.851 --> 25:04.845
regiment of about 2,200 people. called the School 
Troop Regiment, actually. It was organized as a

25:08.382 --> 25:13.708
cavalry regiment, mechanized cavalry regiment.

25:17.252 --> 25:30.647
It was a very difficult thing to command, and an 
officer that had no command experience can find

25:17.252 --> 25:30.647
himself in deep trouble in the school with little 
support. I think he felt that because of my command

25:31.994 --> 25:42.574
experience that

25:31.994 --> 25:42.574
I was the guy that should run that. I stayed there 
some time.

25:49.865 --> 26:08.599
The size of the military began to decrease and it 
came back to about a battalion size because they

25:49.865 --> 26:08.599
decided that's all they needed because the 
student load had been reduced as a result of the war

25:49.865 --> 26:08.599
being over and the Japanese conflict was over. The 
foreign student requirement was dropping off.

26:14.700 --> 26:28.338
They had quite a number of Chinese officers, South 
American officers, Canadians, Brits, and

26:14.700 --> 26:28.338
everybody from all over the world there as 
students. That began to drop off. The

26:31.021 --> 26:38.451
requirements decreased and the unit became a 
battalion size unit.

26:40.304 --> 27:00.372
Then I was, I guess after 18 months or more, some 
point about that time, I then moved to become the

26:40.304 --> 27:00.372
Chief of Combined Arms Tactics in the Department 
of Tactics at the Cavalry School.

27:00.392 --> 27:09.265
And I stayed there until a commanding general was 
sent to

27:11.540 --> 27:20.733
command the Constabulary, which was more or less 
the occupation forces in West Germany. Before we

27:20.753 --> 27:27.263
get to West Germany, I want to ask you a couple 
questions about this period 1945 to 1949. One

27:28.144 --> 27:35.775
thing that happened was that the services were 
changed quite a bit. the Air Corps became the Air

27:36.835 --> 27:41.920
Force and the Joint Chiefs of Staff was set up and 
everything. What were your feelings about that?

27:47.406 --> 28:05.644
Well, it was the sort of thing that

27:47.406 --> 28:05.644
I felt was coming along primarily because of the 
size of the remaining Air Corps. and because of its

28:07.835 --> 28:37.774
responsibilities

28:07.835 --> 28:37.774
it

28:07.835 --> 28:37.774
just appeared to me that that was an evolutionary 
thing and that it was coming and you'll note that we

28:07.835 --> 28:37.774
have patterned a lot of our lifestyles and a lot of 
our culture and a lot of our way of life after that

28:38.227 --> 28:50.909
Western Europe, and you'll find that the 
Luftwaffe was a separate arm and RAF was a separate

28:38.227 --> 28:50.909
arm. Not so in the Soviet, but we don't, never have, 
and I hope never will pattern anything after the

28:59.692 --> 29:02.575
soldiers. Now what about another thing during 
this time Harry Truman issued an executive order

29:02.595 --> 29:15.009
integrating the Armed Forces blocks instead of in 
separate units would be integrated units. What

29:15.049 --> 29:16.290
were your feelings about that? Well I'd expressed 
my feelings back when I was ten years old and I had no

29:18.492 --> 29:23.678
problem with that.

29:27.362 --> 29:28.163
We had many many failures within the military of 
solid black units and so you always try to work your

29:28.717 --> 29:48.303
way away from the failure and I thought that that 
would be a good move to split everybody up and put a

29:28.717 --> 29:48.303
few here and a few there. And I think that the Army, 
although President Truman, who I knew

29:48.363 --> 29:57.795
personally, I

29:59.193 --> 30:09.746
think he kind of looked for the Army to set the 
example for this nation, and I think we have. I

30:09.766 --> 30:11.768
think we have. You said that you knew, when did you 
meet Truman? Can you tell me about that? Well, to

30:18.917 --> 30:23.523
sit down and talk to him personally was after he 
left the White House. As I'd mentioned to you, Mr.

30:29.180 --> 30:51.550
President Kennedy had appointed me with 
approval, of course, of Mr. Magnum there as Deputy

30:29.180 --> 30:51.550
Assistant Secretary of Defense when I was a 
colonel, and that's a political appointee,

30:29.180 --> 30:51.550
civilian slot.

30:51.570 --> 30:57.718
And the occasion arose for me to go visit with sit 
down and visit with President

30:58.205 --> 31:26.845
Truman was when President Kennedy was trying to 
influence

30:58.205 --> 31:26.845
a piece of legislation

30:58.205 --> 31:26.845
which

30:58.205 --> 31:26.845
was going to have a serious impact on his authority 
unless we kill the legislation on the president's

30:58.205 --> 31:26.845
authority. And through my research, well, I had 
found that a like incident had occurred during

31:28.833 --> 31:56.511
President Truman's tenure and that we had been 
able to beat the

31:28.833 --> 31:56.511
legislation at that time. and that President 
Kennedy dispatched me, I was in the Department of

31:58.043 --> 32:06.814
Defense, to go visit with. Since we could not find 
any reference in the files in the White House to

32:07.715 --> 32:26.920
this particular matter, which had occurred 
several years back,

32:07.715 --> 32:26.920
President Kennedy asked Mr. McNamara to dispatch 
me to sit down with President Truman out in

32:27.693 --> 32:46.633
Independence and see if we could

32:27.693 --> 32:46.633
put this together and seek his support and also his 
documentation on this during his time.

32:49.376 --> 32:55.202
And

32:49.376 --> 32:55.202
I called President Truman

32:58.878 --> 33:05.625
He wasted no time saying, Mr. Secretary, you come 
straight away. He said, we'll sit down and iron

33:05.645 --> 33:08.247
this thing out. He said, how is Jack? And I said, 
well, Mr. President, I don't see President

33:10.369 --> 33:17.877
Kennedy very often, but I said, I think he's doing 
great. He said, I do too. And you come on out. So I

33:21.400 --> 33:22.401
went on out. Sit down, and I spent an hour and a half 
with him. still working as if he was in the White

33:28.257 --> 33:43.938
House answering calls from all over the country 
and giving people hell when they needed it over the

33:28.257 --> 33:43.938
phone. And I recall one conversation, someone had 
called him, and I said, shall I leave, Mr.

33:43.958 --> 33:51.409
President? He said, no, you stay where you are. I 
said, I want you to hear what's going on here. So a

33:57.974 --> 34:08.008
telephone call, he said, he answered back to 
whoever it was, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Then all at

34:08.709 --> 34:14.358
once he says, and by God, now you listen to me. You 
don't tell me, I'll tell you. So he was still very

34:16.941 --> 34:26.395
much informed, I'd say, at that point in time. By 
his assistance, I brought the material back, got a

34:27.421 --> 34:43.064
copy of the matter, and we were able to

34:27.421 --> 34:43.064
keep the presidential authority in order.

34:51.676 --> 34:54.340
I'm wondering what we're talking about. We were 
talking about the blacks and then we were talking

34:54.573 --> 34:58.898
about Mr. Truman. Now let's go back to Germany. In 
August of 1949, you were assigned commander of the

35:01.120 --> 35:12.853
Special Troops Regiment in the U.S. 
Constabulary.

35:13.654 --> 35:16.538
Now this is during the Berlin blockade. What 
impact did that have on

35:17.739 --> 35:23.145
your job? There was a great enhancement of 
security all in Western Europe because

35:24.610 --> 35:40.927
we had no idea at the time what the outcome of this 
blockade was going to be.

35:41.388 --> 35:48.255
We knew the Soviet strength and the location of 
their units in East Germany. We knew the strength

35:49.619 --> 35:57.451
and composition of the East Germans, Poles, 
Czechs, Hungarians, and the members of the Warsaw

35:49.619 --> 35:57.451
Pact. But here we were in Western Europe with a 
strength of about 55,000. I'm talking about

36:04.301 --> 36:07.065
combat troops. We had the 1st Division, the big red 
one, who was later, as you know, my favorite

36:07.085 --> 36:16.639
division.

36:17.277 --> 36:28.030
And we had the Constabulary, which was made up of 
armored cavalry regiments, and there were some

36:17.277 --> 36:28.030
separate battalions.

36:30.754 --> 36:34.038
And we had quite a sector. We had from the Austrian 
border, all of the Austrian border facing West

36:34.098 --> 36:44.871
Germany, the Czech border, and then part of the 
East German border up as far as it exists right

36:45.813 --> 36:54.925
today, near Castle. Well, that was an awesome 
responsibility for only 55,000 troops. So, it was

37:01.614 --> 37:14.672
a sort of thing where you planned and watched very 
carefully about what you were going to do about a

37:01.614 --> 37:14.672
big headquarters in Frankfurt, in Heidelberg and 
a big headquarters in Stuttgart, which we were a

37:15.344 --> 37:25.415
part

37:15.344 --> 37:25.415
of. It was an intense period which really, I think, 
triggered

37:26.616 --> 37:45.317
a build-up

37:26.616 --> 37:45.317
to the strength that you have over today. Another 
thing that influenced subsequent action that

37:47.423 --> 38:06.259
influenced the intensity of things there was 5 
o'clock on the morning of the 25th of June 1950 when

37:47.423 --> 38:06.259
the Koreans come charging across the DMZ And my 
God, people are trying to get out of Europe to go to

38:06.863 --> 38:15.873
the Korean conflict, and we were faced with a 
conflict there. The intensity of the Warsaw Pact

38:15.913 --> 38:36.195
was exacerbated by excessive patrolling and 
activity all along the front. I remember very well

38:37.981 --> 38:52.843
at 2 o'clock in the morning, I had a flash message 
from a cavalry troop at Hof, Germany,

38:37.981 --> 38:52.843
and I was called to the headquarters. At this point 
in time, I was chief of operations for Seventh

38:52.983 --> 38:57.450
Army. Now I've been growing up to Seventh Army. I 
was chief of operations in the G3 section. A duty

39:07.985 --> 39:16.015
officer called me two o'clock in the morning, can 
you please come to headquarters, we have a flash

39:07.985 --> 39:16.015
top secret message from the front.

39:19.078 --> 39:22.662
I jumped in my clothes, I lived ten minutes away 
from headquarters. Got to headquarters, got in

39:24.344 --> 39:27.328
there, looked at the message. I called my boss, who 
was a brigadier general, and I said, keep a

39:36.250 --> 39:40.975
watchful eye on this situation, and he said, well, 
I'll be there soon. I said, okay.

39:45.000 --> 39:58.655
We spent the rest of the night there, and during the 
night, we prepared a message for the Army

39:45.000 --> 39:58.655
commander to send back to the United States to 
evacuate our civilians out of there, civilian

39:45.000 --> 39:58.655
dependents. What did the flash message say? The 
flash message was that there was a Soviet tank

40:00.817 --> 40:04.401
company had gathered itself up just across from a 
crossing point. And we had one small cavalry

40:11.240 --> 40:16.285
platoon there. That's all. That's all we could 
afford. They had a whole tank company of thirteen

40:19.409 --> 40:21.991
tanks. And they had moved down there and they were 
making

40:23.213 --> 40:32.903
signs of coming across the border. And if they had, 
that would have started it, and we had nothing to

40:33.153 --> 40:39.879
stop it with. Our little cavalry platoon would 
have been eaten up in a few minutes, and here they

40:39.899 --> 40:45.365
come. So you don't want dependents around in the 
country when that does, because dependents are a

40:47.106 --> 41:01.540
great hindrance to you, because it's very 
difficult to get a human being to to leave his wife

41:02.735 --> 41:18.893
or children unknowingly what's going to happen to 
them and go out to fight and hoping that somebody

41:02.735 --> 41:18.893
else is going to take care of them, he's usually 
going to say, to hell with that. I'm not going to

41:19.013 --> 41:23.678
leave them to go anywhere until I get my family out 
of here. And then after I do that, I'll come back and

41:24.880 --> 41:27.283
fight. Well, you've got to have all of them say 
that, then you've lost the battle. Oh, for sure. So

41:32.975 --> 41:36.458
that's a trouble with dependents in an area which 
may be threatened. But it was an intense period, no

41:38.180 --> 41:41.943
question about that. Now NATO was formed at this 
time, North Atlanta Treaty Organization in 1949.

41:47.148 --> 41:48.829
Did you have any dealings with that? The only 
dealings I had was to work out war plans with the

41:49.450 --> 42:00.400
French and to conduct exercises. with them and 
where they were participants. And I was extremely

42:04.517 --> 42:12.584
worried about that because the communist 
infiltration into France at that time was pretty

42:04.517 --> 42:12.584
strong. And I was really very hesitant to pass on 
top secret information during training

42:13.725 --> 42:23.854
exercises, joint exercises, to the French. Did 
you pass on that information? Yes, I did. Yes, I

42:28.679 --> 42:29.239
did.

42:33.286 --> 42:35.469
like it at the time, as it was. What did you think of 
the quality of the French? I thought the French

42:38.933 --> 42:52.449
were no better than they were, I felt, in World War 
II, which wasn't very far off.

42:53.050 --> 43:02.702
The French suffered a disastrous slaughter of 
their leadership during World War I.

43:06.091 --> 43:08.674
was questioned the recovery today. Questioned 
the recovery

43:10.557 --> 43:15.383
today. Their tactics during World War II, imagine 
no line.

43:26.177 --> 43:29.361
Imagine no line complex.

43:32.745 --> 43:35.929
We must never allow that to happen in this country.

43:38.660 --> 43:41.444
We just can't allow it to happen. I'm afraid it 
still exists in the minds of

43:41.624 --> 43:48.094
some of the French.

43:54.183 --> 44:08.143
I visited

43:54.183 --> 44:08.143
some of their commanders in 1976, 77,

43:54.183 --> 44:08.143
and

44:14.013 --> 44:43.328
I was

44:14.013 --> 44:43.328
impressed with the fact that there are a few 
old-time World War II leaders still around who

44:14.013 --> 44:43.328
know what war is all about,

44:14.013 --> 44:43.328
but their armed forces have been treated very 
shabbily

44:45.923 --> 44:49.847
from the standpoint of conventional capability.

44:52.369 --> 45:12.189
I doubt that they could fight more than 30 days 
sustained action without losing a hell of a lot of

44:52.369 --> 45:12.189
equipment that couldn't be replaced and also 
running out of ammunition in many instances. They

45:12.249 --> 45:15.812
have spent their money on nukes. And kind of like 
this country, no one can ever afford to have a

45:16.754 --> 45:31.131
nuclear war, but on the other hand, you can't 
afford not to have that option since the other guys

45:16.754 --> 45:31.131
got the option. But in my private view, it'll be way 
beyond the 50th century before anybody ever fires

45:31.212 --> 45:44.688
a nuclear weapon for anything other than making 
electricity. And that we ought to get.
