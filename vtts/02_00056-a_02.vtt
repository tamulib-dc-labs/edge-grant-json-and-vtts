WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:04.286
intramural situation. And actually A&M had an 
excellent intramural program, which Penberthy,

00:05.468 --> 00:24.100
who I think was from Ohio State, really sort of was 
very innovative and so forth. What were the most

00:26.778 --> 00:31.651
important, the most respected activities in the 
intramurals? What sports were most?

00:36.604 --> 00:41.918
Well, actually probably intramural football 
was. And then intramural basketball, but they

00:42.303 --> 00:46.169
also had everything. They had wrestling, and

00:46.189 --> 01:02.456
they had boxing, and the outfits competed very 
vigorously for this intramural championship,

00:46.189 --> 01:02.456
which went on and wasn't awarded until the end of 
the year. But for instance, when I was a freshman,

01:08.543 --> 01:11.989
They had to have so many entrants in wrestling. I'd 
never wrestled before in my life. And so I went down

01:14.633 --> 01:23.548
and entered the wrestling deal and went up against 
some guy from West Texas. He picked me up and we

01:23.815 --> 01:37.459
grappled around for a few minutes and finally he 
threw me out of the ring and broke my collarbone,

01:23.815 --> 01:37.459
which ended my wrestling career. Was that your 
freshman? My freshman year. I think basketball

01:41.146 --> 01:46.434
season was over by then, so it didn't interfere 
with my basketball thing. Where did you get

01:46.494 --> 01:49.058
treated for that injury? At the hospital there. I 
forget the doctor's name. Marsh? Dr. Marsh,

01:55.168 --> 01:56.590
wasn't it? And Mom Claghorn, she was the principal 
nurse over there. Describe her. I recall Mom

02:03.260 --> 02:06.225
Claghorn, she was a, a big woman who took charge of 
everything. I mean, she, her word was, was

02:10.239 --> 02:15.144
indisputable, let's say. Yeah. Want a coffee, 
Reba, Phil? We're talking about the hospital.

02:20.670 --> 02:21.391
Right, right. But, yeah, Dr. Marsh treated, 
treated everything, and, but Mom Claghorn was the

02:31.687 --> 02:45.543
was the really, as I say, a big woman and

02:31.687 --> 02:45.543
her

02:31.687 --> 02:45.543
decision was not disputed by anybody. Where did 
you and your buddies, if you had any unscheduled

02:46.304 --> 02:57.897
time during the day, where did you go if you had some 
off hours?

02:58.433 --> 03:03.023
On the off hours, we'd go to the North Gate, as it was 
called. What was up there? Not very much. Just cold

03:08.816 --> 03:12.645
drinks and I think there was a movie theater up 
there too. Campus theater. But there were cold

03:17.263 --> 03:20.448
drinks and so forth. And then let's see, the guys 
with,

03:21.309 --> 03:37.772
let's see, large amounts of testosterone, 
managed to go into town and find some

03:38.242 --> 03:50.681
girls there. A lot of them ended up marrying the 
gals they met in Bryan. Now, during the day, what

03:55.508 --> 04:00.396
did y'all do at the Y? At the Y, you could play 
ping-pong. And you could also cash checks. Mr.

04:10.287 --> 04:13.832
Cashin, as I recall, had the drugstore there. And 
the drugstore was adjacent to the YMCA. Describe

04:21.204 --> 04:23.988
Mr. Cashin as much as you recall about him. I recall 
Mr. Cashin was a guy with horn-rimmed glasses who

04:32.461 --> 04:37.246
actually looked very closely at the check he was 
trying to cash. But he ran the drug store. And he ran

04:41.230 --> 04:42.552
the Y. Did you all have a nickname for him? Not that I 
recall. One

04:47.117 --> 05:00.831
of the nicknames I remember, they had the guy that 
used to hand out the uniforms and so forth in the

05:01.756 --> 05:08.988
basketball park was a guy nicknamed Sarge for some 
reason. Sarge had a nose that looked like W.C.

05:09.048 --> 05:13.335
Fields. It had its ample supply of bourbon over the 
years.

05:21.308 --> 05:22.691
Let's see, where did you get your mail? Was it at the 
Y or at the Northgate?

05:29.684 --> 05:38.455
I think we had mailboxes over in the 
administration building, but I'm not sure about

05:29.684 --> 05:38.455
that. I'm hazy about that. What kind of errands did 
a fish get to run for upperclassmen? Anything they

05:44.624 --> 05:46.626
could think of. Go to the North Gate, get them food, 
get magazines for them.

05:56.161 --> 06:00.451
And actually, the way it was determined, they'd 
haul a fish. An upper class would haul a fish, and

06:00.691 --> 06:11.014
everybody would run to that room, and the last one 
there had to run the air on it. During those early

06:12.580 --> 06:20.388
months, where did you turn for advice about 
academics? Who helped you if you couldn't figure

06:21.429 --> 06:25.353
out this homework problem? Who did you turn to?

06:29.798 --> 06:42.030
Well, actually, on homework,

06:29.798 --> 06:42.030
in my fish year, I became friends with Hank Gruy, 
who was a very smart guy. And especially in math. I

06:46.822 --> 06:48.484
was always very good in English. But I would go to, 
Hank later became the, he has his own consulting

06:50.487 --> 06:57.957
firm, petroleum consulting firm. And he was 
elected president of the Society of Petroleum

06:59.098 --> 07:02.483
Engineers. And I remember one time getting stuck 
on a calculus problem. I tried to work on about 830,

07:09.938 --> 07:19.293
and I went over to Hank's room, which he was in the 
engineers, and he had worked the problem and gone

07:09.938 --> 07:19.293
to bed. But I turned to Hank on math as much as 
anything. Now, your first semester, do you

07:25.984 --> 07:30.411
remember how you did academically? I did well. I 
think I was a distinguished student every year.

07:39.939 --> 07:42.443
And you had gone to public high school? Yes. So you 
were well prepared. I was well prepared. Like I

07:47.452 --> 07:52.439
say, Barrett High School was a good school that I 
graduated from. But actually in the country

07:53.161 --> 08:02.455
schools I went to, the teachers wanted to teach you 
something. And I had a good foundation. And I later

08:06.080 --> 08:12.750
went to MIT as a graduate student and was accepted 
there. And I thought it was sort of interesting. I

08:18.156 --> 08:21.201
think there were five of us from my class that went 
to MIT. And we all did well. I mean, we graduated

08:22.783 --> 08:26.389
without any problem. In class, how did you and your 
buddies dress? How did you behave? What was

08:33.100 --> 08:34.502
normal? decorum for class? Well, there was no 
disputing the professors at all. And, of course,

08:40.769 --> 08:57.628
you were dressed in the uniform and you

08:40.769 --> 08:57.628
paid attention and took notes and no disturbance

08:40.769 --> 08:57.628
in class. Did you go to class every day? Oh, yeah. 
What about going to sleep in class? Oh, the people

09:02.798 --> 09:05.787
that did that, quite a bit. But actually, the 
classes were well controlled.

09:15.050 --> 09:30.669
As you got into

09:15.050 --> 09:30.669
the subject that you were graduating in, those 
classes got much smaller, of course, and you had a

09:15.050 --> 09:30.669
lot of individual attention. In freshman year, 
though, we had large classes like Tom Harrington

09:31.270 --> 09:38.779
teaching this chemical. Were there some classes 
for freshmen or sophomores that everybody

09:38.759 --> 09:49.782
dreaded that were supposed to be real tough?

09:50.082 --> 09:58.540
I can't answer your question exactly, but I 
remember there were some classes they thought

09:58.520 --> 10:00.402
were real easy, you know. What were they? Well, 
physical education and actually,

10:03.165 --> 10:18.041
I guess, in the early stages, bull tax, as it was 
called, you know, was a military part of the deal.

10:18.902 --> 10:26.130
And my mind just thinks about was the dog revelry 
already there? Oh, yes. I think Reveille

10:26.751 --> 10:34.143
appeared, I'm not sure it was my freshman year or 
had been there a year. I think he'd been there a

10:34.183 --> 10:35.466
year. But that little dog was a little black dog. 
And the tradition was if that little dog came in

10:38.991 --> 10:49.208
your room and jumped up on your bed to sleep there, 
you had to go find another bed, you know. Did that

10:49.529 --> 10:50.751
ever happen to you? No, it happened to friends of 
mine, though. And there was no, you know, get off

10:56.365 --> 11:00.271
the bed or anything, believe me. I mean, people 
adhered to the, they wouldn't find another bed.

11:04.678 --> 11:08.223
And as far as you all knew, where did Reveille, the 
original Reveille, come from? Well, as I recall,

11:09.525 --> 11:17.717
the little dog was hit by a car, and two of the guys 
brought a, brought her back to the

11:17.933 --> 11:34.997
vet's deal and the vets treated the little dog and 
the dog survived alright and just sort of wandered

11:17.933 --> 11:34.997
around the campus and also apparently was 
attracted to the band and would bark when the band

11:34.977 --> 11:44.010
would play and march with the band to the football 
games. Went to class sometimes? Oh yeah, the

11:45.693 --> 11:48.497
little dog would go to class and come in classes. 
Ever allowed in Sabeasa? Oh yeah, the little dog

11:53.004 --> 11:56.148
had free rein anywhere. That's what I've heard. 
What about as a freshman, how soon was it before you

11:59.210 --> 12:06.827
and your buddies got involved in Good Bull, in 
pranks?

12:09.914 --> 12:17.370
Well, of course, from the very first, they had a 
tradition of drowning out people. And that

12:17.350 --> 12:20.335
happened when you were a freshman. And actually, 
if there's somebody in your battery that you

12:21.196 --> 12:34.498
thought was brown-nosing, let's say, the guys 
would get together and say, let's round out

12:21.196 --> 12:34.498
so-and-so. So, sure enough, at night, after the 
guy was asleep, They'd run under two or three

12:38.545 --> 12:45.118
buckets of water and drown him out and run. They 
never knew who had done that. Did you ever do or did

12:47.222 --> 12:49.907
you ever participate in a drownout? Oh, yeah. Oh, 
yeah. Did you get caught? No. No. Never did. Now,

12:55.218 --> 12:58.643
the victim was usually in what class? Sophomore or 
senior or what? Well, it could be in either class. I

13:01.928 --> 13:06.776
mean, the freshmen themselves round out guys that 
they thought were brown-nosing, let's say. So it

13:06.796 --> 13:08.258
might even be another fish. Oh, yeah, another 
fish. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Describe, if you can,

13:14.728 --> 13:20.036
your going to your first Aggie football game. 
Describe that whole weekend and all that went on.

13:24.648 --> 13:31.079
Well, I don't recall the first weekend, but I do 
recall the TCU game. Because A&M hadn't beaten TCU

13:32.501 --> 13:36.668
in 10 or 12 years, something like that. And so they 
had a rally on the YMCA steps. And I remember he

13:44.020 --> 13:46.723
introduced the football team. Joe Rout got up, 
made a speech, and so forth.

13:55.293 --> 14:00.699
But beating TCU at that time was a big deal. I'm 
trying to think. The first football game, of

14:04.684 --> 14:12.373
course, we had the tradition was standing up and so 
forth. Did you all have a Yale practice the night

14:12.742 --> 14:14.766
before? Oh, yeah. Where? Yeah, we had a Yale 
practice the night before. Do you remember where

14:19.776 --> 14:21.860
Yale practices were then? I don't remember. I 
don't remember where they were. Then Saturday

14:27.832 --> 14:30.598
morning you went to class. Yes, I recall Saturday 
morning after class we were off Saturday

14:30.781 --> 14:33.828
afternoon. So you were free to do things, catch up 
on your... Did you all have, for going to the game on

14:35.331 --> 14:47.760
Saturday afternoon, did you all march in to the 
stadium?

14:51.605 --> 14:52.989
I'm quite sure we did. I'm sort of hazy on that, but 
I'm quite sure we marched in. Yeah, we marched

14:56.618 --> 14:57.781
everywhere. And you stood up at the game. Oh, yeah, 
you stood up at the game. All right, then did y'all

15:00.910 --> 15:04.399
win that TCU game that year? I don't recall, except 
I just recall the buildup beforehand. When you did

15:09.896 --> 15:13.181
win the game, did you all capture the L-eaters? 
Yeah, as I recall, we did. We threw them in the fish

15:16.165 --> 15:18.809
pond. Then on a Saturday night, after a game or 
anything else, where did you and your buddies go

15:18.909 --> 15:29.145
your first year or two on a Saturday night? On a 
Saturday night, A lot of guys went to a place called

15:33.792 --> 15:37.763
Hard Liquor's. They had Hard Liquor's and drank 
beer. I never was a much of a beer drinker, so I think

15:47.309 --> 15:52.218
I'd go to a movie or something like that. But a good 
many of these guys went to. Now during your first

15:55.665 --> 16:00.554
year, you said your father had died when you were a 
youngster. Your mother's still living. Right,

16:01.877 --> 16:02.598
right. Who did you write to and who did you get mail 
from? My mother, principally, and a couple of

16:06.125 --> 16:21.001
girlfriends from Shreveport, and some that I met 
on court trips. Describe a court trip. A court

16:22.902 --> 16:32.993
trip, you'd come to Dallas, let's say, and you'd 
check into a hotel usually about as many as could

16:33.580 --> 16:35.743
get in a room, you know. Only a couple of guys would 
sign for it, but really about four or five guys

16:35.983 --> 16:40.909
stayed there at the office or somewhere. You'd 
march up Main Street and have Yale practice in

16:41.349 --> 16:49.359
front of the hotel, as I recall. And

16:49.740 --> 16:58.170
then they were, and you usually In Dallas, you 
usually met a bunch of girls that came down from

16:58.606 --> 17:05.095
CIA. Anyway, usually after a court trip, you had a 
correspondence going with somebody from Denton.

17:14.268 --> 17:15.790
How did you make contact? Did you write to them 
first? No, you sort of met them in the lobby of the

17:19.035 --> 17:22.340
office, let's say. How did you pick the one that 
interested you? Well,

17:28.087 --> 17:53.740
just the, I'd say just the normal chemistry 
between somebody, you know, that somebody that

17:28.087 --> 17:53.740
conversation and so forth was, and maybe he'd take 
them to dinner, whatever, and Did Aggies behave

17:54.142 --> 17:57.609
pretty well around young ladies in those days? Oh, 
yes. Yes, I think they did. I mean, there was a

17:59.512 --> 18:04.061
different code at that time than now. I mean, there 
was a respect for women at that time. Did any of your

18:09.171 --> 18:12.437
student friends have a car? Only a few. Only a few 
had cars. I remember one of them was the Mitchells

18:16.118 --> 18:20.205
from Houston. And Johnny Mitchell and George, 
they had convertibles, as a matter of fact, which

18:20.987 --> 18:28.520
was a big deal at that time. What kind of 
convertible? Do you remember? I don't remember.

18:30.623 --> 18:31.665
They were just convertibles. Wow.

18:37.375 --> 18:40.379
Big men on the campus were there. Where were the 
student parking places then? I'm not sure, but I

18:44.585 --> 18:53.698
remember there were places you couldn't park. I 
remember Bobby Early, who I played on the tennis

18:54.740 --> 19:04.193
team with, he had an A-model Ford, and he parked it 
in a no-parking place. And anyway, they

19:04.426 --> 19:15.561
confiscated the car and took part of the thing off 
so he couldn't start the car. And he had to go down

19:16.522 --> 19:21.068
and see the commandant before he could get the car 
back, and he had to pay a fine.

19:23.812 --> 19:24.613
Bobby did that.

19:29.259 --> 19:30.501
Back to football. core trips went to Fort Worth and 
Dallas and Houston and Austin. Of all of your

19:36.309 --> 19:43.502
years, do you have any special memories of core 
trips, plus or minus? Yeah, I think the core trip I

19:44.784 --> 19:54.261
remember mostly is a TCU core trip because on that 
core trip I met a gal named Frances Buster whose

19:54.342 --> 20:05.443
father was a professor at TCU, and she later 
married Davey O'Brien, as a matter of fact. But she

20:05.463 --> 20:11.515
was really a cute little thing, and we 
corresponded for maybe six or seven months,

20:05.463 --> 20:11.515
something like that. But that's why I remember 
that course. Do you remember how you met her? I

20:15.807 --> 20:20.894
think I met in the lobby of the hotel, you know, one 
of the hotels there. And anything, do you remember

20:21.715 --> 20:25.760
any sad things on a court trip ever? Yeah, I 
remember the sad thing, I remember Bobby Early,

20:26.521 --> 20:35.993
he had signed up for was a room I think was in Dallas. 
And this was, I think, his junior year. And anyway,

20:43.981 --> 20:47.552
there were a whole bunch of, there was some, Bobby 
was in A Troop Cavalry, and I remember, and they

20:48.224 --> 21:01.765
were, but he was signed up for the room, but he 
actually, actually didn't ever go to the room. He

21:01.805 --> 21:10.258
went, he had some other friends, and he stayed with 
them, ran into them, or some other thing, and these

21:01.805 --> 21:10.258
other people really tore up the room. I mean, they, 
so Bobby got nailed for it, And actually it cost him

21:13.925 --> 21:15.567
his commission. And he was never there.

21:23.378 --> 21:26.222
Do you remember your first silver taps? I don't 
remember the first one. I remember I was so

21:30.789 --> 21:33.793
impressed the first time I heard it. Describe why. 
I think I understand, but make believe I didn't

21:35.736 --> 21:40.202
understand why a silver taps was special. Well, 
they blew silver towels when of course anybody

21:40.688 --> 21:51.897
died, any cadet died, and I remember It was at night 
and a cold clear night in the fall and the notes of

21:52.433 --> 22:13.041
that bugle just seemed to be the only thing there 
that really stirred up your emotions to think that

22:13.021 --> 22:16.647
that one of your fellow cadets was remembered this 
way. And was Silver Taps always taken seriously?

22:21.875 --> 22:22.596
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Nobody ever broke the rules? 
Oh, no. Not that I know of. Make believe I'd never

22:27.925 --> 22:29.046
been. Where was it held, and what happened? Well,

22:32.039 --> 22:47.322
as I recall, it was just the bugler himself who was 
there, and the bugle stand was in front of the

22:32.039 --> 22:47.322
administration building then, and a big 
megaphone, you know, and you could hear it all over

22:32.039 --> 22:47.322
the campus. You were in your room when they blew it. 
And then you came over, ceremony, and then went

22:50.467 --> 22:54.253
back to your room? No, you just stayed in there. I 
mean, there was no ceremony at all. Oh, really? No,

22:57.499 --> 22:58.961
there was no ceremony. Oh, you all didn't gather? 
No, no, no. There was no ceremony. You were just in

23:03.308 --> 23:07.595
your room when the silver caps was blown. Did you 
turn out the lights then after it was over? As I

23:10.600 --> 23:16.390
recall, it was done at...

23:18.023 --> 23:26.578
I really am hazy on that, exactly what happened, 
but I remember you were in your room when they blew

23:18.023 --> 23:26.578
it, but you knew who the cadet was that was being 
honored. You knew that. And I'm not sure how you

23:28.702 --> 23:31.046
knew that, but you knew that. Your freshman year, 
you didn't go home, I presume, until

23:31.928 --> 23:37.618
Thanksgiving? We went to, I think we went over, the 
first time we went home actually was, A&M was

23:37.598 --> 23:49.820
playing Centenary over in Shreveport. So, Bobby 
Earley had this old A Model Ford. that he had

23:53.832 --> 23:59.706
retrieved from the commandant.

24:00.649 --> 24:10.693
So we drove over for the game, and that old car, the 
problem was how much oil it used. You had to carry

24:10.673 --> 24:16.426
several quarts of oil all the time. And cold? Man, 
it was cold. But anyway, we went to Shreveport for

24:19.152 --> 24:26.167
the game, and so that was sometime in the fall. Did 
you entertain your buddies in Shreveport? Oh,

24:28.713 --> 24:30.035
yeah, yeah. What did you do for them on Saturday 
night? Do you remember? On Saturday night, I think

24:32.680 --> 24:37.488
I took them to the Washington Urey Hotel, as a 
matter of fact. I took Bobby, anyway. Bobby was a

24:40.112 --> 24:42.757
very close friend. All right. Then did you go back 
Thanksgiving? Back home, I reckon? I don't think I

24:46.887 --> 24:50.953
went back home until Christmas, as a matter of 
fact. Did you always take the train back and forth?

24:53.637 --> 25:00.407
Yeah, you took the train, unless somebody was 
driving back. But it was a pretty long trip then,

25:00.928 --> 25:05.414
you know, so I took the train. And you wore your 
uniform going and coming. Right, right. What did

25:09.140 --> 25:13.266
you feel like on the train with you, wearing that 
Aggie uniform? Well, you usually drew some

25:13.246 --> 25:16.670
attention, you know, good or bad. Can you give some 
examples of the good or the bad? Well, I'd say that,

25:21.196 --> 25:36.354
you know, people that knew a little about A&M would 
come up and say, I had a cousin that went here or so

25:21.196 --> 25:36.354
and so, you know, and I got to go to the men's room. 
Did anybody ever tease you when you were wearing

25:38.477 --> 25:42.882
your Aggie uniform on the train or the bus? I'm sure 
they did. I can't remember any particular

25:45.388 --> 25:50.695
incidents, but I'm sure that must have happened. 
But I can't remember any particular answer. All

25:52.812 --> 25:54.895
right, summarize that. When you finished that 
freshman year, how did you feel about being an

25:55.436 --> 25:58.940
Aggie? Well, at the end of the freshman year, I felt 
good. I felt, one, I had survived a really tough

26:05.970 --> 26:15.402
year, and two, that I would now be a sophomore and 
would have the privileges I didn't have before.

26:16.123 --> 26:17.745
And I was pleased with the my academics at that time 
and I thought I was progressing well toward a

26:18.046 --> 26:32.528
degree and I loved the school after after that 
first year and and people who were in the freshman

26:32.795 --> 26:43.668
class with me that enrolled at the very first, they 
either liked the school or they didn't, almost

26:32.795 --> 26:43.668
from the very first. And one of the things that I 
recognized at A&M at that time was that it wasn't,

26:44.649 --> 27:01.570
they judged a person about not who he was, but what 
he was. I mean, there's a difference in who and

27:01.718 --> 27:03.462
what. For instance, one of my classmates was Bert 
Hull. His father had built the tap line pipeline

27:08.153 --> 27:16.111
from Texas up to New York. He was the president of 
Texaco Pipeline Company. And he built the

27:20.247 --> 27:22.753
pipeline in Saudi Arabia. And so Burt was, his 
father was quite wealthy. But to illustrate what

27:27.565 --> 27:34.964
I'm saying, he used to say, well, don't make old 
Burt mad. They called him Balbo. Don't make Balbo

27:36.167 --> 27:37.530
mad. his old man might run a pipeline right through 
the mess hall. So somebody with, let's say, with a

27:41.916 --> 27:48.985
certain amount of wealth really had to overcome 
that to a certain extent. About how many started

27:49.405 --> 27:54.552
out in your outfit, do you remember, as a freshman? 
I don't remember, except that I would say at the end

27:54.572 --> 28:05.165
of the year, I would just estimate that two-thirds 
remained after the first year. Of those who did not

28:07.092 --> 28:16.903
come back, about how many flunked out and how many 
couldn't afford to come, didn't have the money, or

28:07.092 --> 28:16.903
how many just didn't like A&M and went somewhere 
else? I'd say about a third, a third, and a third.

28:20.407 --> 28:25.073
One of my roommates was a fellow named Hudson 
Vanloon. Hudson was from Shreveport. I'd known

28:27.195 --> 28:28.236
him in high school. Hudson loved A&M, but he 
flunked out. He flunked out every semester. and I

28:36.826 --> 29:02.040
used to be somewhat jealous of Hudson because when 
he and I would be walking down the sidewalk and we

28:36.826 --> 29:02.040
occasionally would pass Dean Brooks who was 
Hudson was in his in his school Dean Brooks knew

28:36.826 --> 29:02.040
Hudson quite well he'd say Hudson how are you and he 
didn't know who I was you know and Hudson had to go

28:36.826 --> 29:02.040
see Dean Brooks about every two months but he 
Hudson flunked out to and and he'd be uh He flunked

29:02.020 --> 29:07.206
out three times, I think, but he loved A&M. The 
academics were tough and the life was tough. I

29:13.293 --> 29:28.011
think one thing in retrospect I observed was that 
when you're together in a situation or situations

29:13.293 --> 29:28.011
where the times are tough, no matter what they are, 
You form a friendship there that is a bonding that

29:27.991 --> 29:34.081
you'll never forget. The same thing happened in 
the Army with people that you're under stress with

29:34.121 --> 29:40.031
and you make friends with. Those type of 
friendships are lasting. Did you feel those bonds

29:42.135 --> 29:44.599
already in beginning to be in place in your 
freshman year? Oh yes, freshman year. I knew that I

29:48.902 --> 29:54.754
had friends there that I could call on in times of 
trouble. Did you ever think about dropping out?

29:58.788 --> 29:59.289
No, no. I never thought about dropping out. My 
thought was I always wanted to take graduate

30:01.712 --> 30:08.202
studies at MIT because of the reputation. And so my 
whole emphasis was on making grades good enough so

30:08.643 --> 30:18.177
that I'd be accepted in graduate school at MIT. 
During that freshman year, do you have any idea how

30:18.498 --> 30:21.943
much it cost? I don't know. My mother, 
Fortunately, when my father died, he had just

30:29.534 --> 30:34.782
taken out an insurance policy of $50,000. And he 
died about three months later, a ruptured

30:35.483 --> 30:39.049
appendix. But he left my mother with this $50,000

30:39.589 --> 30:48.203
plus a cotton plantation of about 2,000 acres. And

30:48.643 --> 30:58.258
my mother, being a schoolteacher, really 
emphasized education. She took care of all the

30:58.238 --> 31:00.181
bills. Did you have spending money? Yes. Oh, yes. I 
had a certain amount. I had an allowance. What did

31:05.650 --> 31:06.972
you spend that allowance on? Usually on Coca-Cola 
and sandwiches and magazines and nothing very

31:09.216 --> 31:17.709
exciting. But my mother sent me allowance every 
month. Now, you went to the movie. Right. Gynon

31:23.839 --> 31:24.600
Hall.
