WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:21.297
this is may 31st 1900 and we're sitting in the 
office of the executive director of the former

00:03.997 --> 00:21.297
students association and getting ready to 
interview porter garner iii porter use your mic

00:03.997 --> 00:21.297
for a sentence how's that test one two A little 
stronger, I think, based on location. To begin

00:27.527 --> 00:39.329
with, to introduce yourself to anyone that might 
hear this tape or read the transcription,

00:27.527 --> 00:39.329
describe family background, where you grew up, 
where you went to high school.

00:42.054 --> 00:42.154
Okay. I grew up in Laredo, Texas, down on the Rio 
Grande border with a father who was a member of the

00:43.957 --> 01:00.583
class of 1945, a grandfather who had two degrees 
from the University of Texas, and a degree from

00:43.957 --> 01:00.583
Texas A&I University. In fact, something I'm 
rather proud of, when Texas A&I was founded, my

01:00.623 --> 01:10.639
grandfather was the first in line to enroll. and 
would have been recorded as the first student to

01:10.619 --> 01:32.466
enroll at Texas A&I if not for the gentleman in him 
whereupon there was a young lady behind him and he

01:10.619 --> 01:32.466
said ladies first and she is recorded as the first 
person to enroll at Texas A&I. However, As a

01:33.147 --> 01:45.260
footnote to that, she did recognize that Porter S. 
Garner Sr., at the time, was in fact the first

01:33.147 --> 01:45.260
person and allowed her to be enrolled first. 
Tremendous academic influence on me as a young

01:46.702 --> 01:51.147
man. Had two older sisters, both graduates of the 
University of Texas with multiple degrees. Our

01:58.475 --> 02:02.800
grandfather, Porter S. Garner Sr., voracious 
reader, often emphasized reading and often

02:02.780 --> 02:14.536
rewarded us with books, particularly for 
birthdays and other anniversaries.

02:15.999 --> 02:25.632
So, a tremendous influence on my life, Haskell, 
from the standpoint of learning, gaining

02:15.999 --> 02:25.632
knowledge, being self-informed. In addition to 
that, my father and mother were both college

02:25.612 --> 02:36.564
graduates and promoted the value of education 
from my earliest recollection.

02:39.206 --> 02:48.857
My father came to Texas A&M in 1941, and Texas A&M 
had just won a national championship in football.

02:48.917 --> 02:50.959
He was a pretty good athlete. He went to World War 
II. was injured in Germany, severely so, but came

02:56.172 --> 03:19.521
back to Laredo, married my mother, a graduate of 
the Our Lady of Lake College in San Antonio, and

02:56.172 --> 03:19.521
went to work in the insurance business, but 
ultimately was recruited by my mother's father to

02:56.172 --> 03:19.521
work in the food service industry in Nuevo Laredo, 
Mexico, at a place called the Cadillac Bar. And I

03:20.142 --> 03:22.905
mention that only because It had somewhat of an 
influence on me as I grew up. My interests were like

03:29.207 --> 03:31.070
many young men. I love to hunt, finish, fish, love 
the outdoors. Was not a Sterling student in high

03:35.578 --> 03:48.201
school, but did graduate from Laredo-Nixon High 
School in 1975 with honors and top 15% of my class,

03:35.578 --> 03:48.201
what have you. But in those formative years 
leading up to my graduation from high school, the

03:48.181 --> 04:10.729
Cadillac bar influenced me from the perspective 
of seeing a lot of those

03:48.181 --> 04:10.729
people who were not privileged in any shape or 
fashion.

04:11.485 --> 04:23.927
It instilled in me an appreciation and a respect 
for all people, regardless of their status in

04:11.485 --> 04:23.927
life, their class, their upbringing, their 
education, or what have you. It also, as a

04:24.568 --> 04:35.147
byproduct, gave me a tremendous leg up on my fellow 
students at Texas A&M in that I was fluent in

04:24.568 --> 04:35.147
Spanish by the age of 15. In fact, I would say that 
quite possibly at age 15, I was more fluent in

04:35.127 --> 04:42.376
Spanish than I was in English. But I made a big 
mistake in 1975 when I graduated from Laredo Nixon

04:44.038 --> 04:49.325
High School. I took a placement test hoping to 
place out of Spanish, and I did, placed out of about

04:50.166 --> 05:01.860
12 hours of Spanish. and in retrospect after 
struggling through my sophomore year at A&M I

05:01.840 --> 05:20.980
could have sure used those grade points and 
credits I'll tell you so that was a mistake on my

05:01.840 --> 05:20.980
behalf but I'd just say that my background growing 
up on the border having an interest in in the

05:01.840 --> 05:20.980
outdoors being raised around a restaurant and bar 
with predominantly Spanish-speaking employees

05:20.960 --> 05:31.697
was a real benefit to me in many, many ways. And it 
served me well when I got to Texas A&M because it

05:32.699 --> 05:48.604
gave me a diversity and, more importantly, I 
think, an appreciation for all cultures that I

05:32.699 --> 05:48.604
would soon be thrown in with at Texas A&M that I had 
not been exposed to in Laredo. Interestingly

05:49.968 --> 05:53.973
enough, I did not come to A&M as a freshman. I was 
accepted to A&M as a freshman, but like many young

05:55.074 --> 06:07.729
men at age 17, I was in love, and I decided that 
Laredo Junior College might be a good stepping

05:55.074 --> 06:07.729
stone for me. But that soon faded. I made a trip to 
College Station in the fall of 1975 to see some

06:10.572 --> 06:16.920
friends who had in fact come to A&M. And

06:16.900 --> 06:38.638
went to a midnight Yale practice with those 
friends and met a young lady and quickly fell out of

06:16.900 --> 06:38.638
love and reapplied for admission and came to A&M 
the fall of 1976 as a sophomore. I would

06:38.618 --> 06:44.547
characterize my three and a half years at A&M as 
some of the best years of my life.

06:47.292 --> 07:06.702
I'd say that much like you've probably heard in all 
of your, I suspect in all of your interviews with

06:47.292 --> 07:06.702
former students,

06:47.292 --> 07:06.702
made the best friends I've ever had, people that I 
consider lifelong friends.

07:06.682 --> 07:10.449
I majored in business, specifically marketing. 
Here, let us go through that. I'm sorry, I was

07:13.554 --> 07:15.859
getting ahead of you. When you had visited before, 
what were your early impressions of what the

07:15.879 --> 07:25.416
campus seemed to be like? That's a great question, 
and I could go on for about two hours on that. Being

07:30.425 --> 07:36.893
raised by a member of the class of 45, I was brought 
up to A&M in the 60s. My earliest recollection is a

07:37.013 --> 07:51.432
class reunion, albeit I think what they call or 
referred to as an informal class reunion in the

07:37.013 --> 07:51.432
early 60s, when Texas A&M was not winning a whole 
lot of football games. However, That didn't stop

07:53.054 --> 07:59.703
the Class of 45 from coming to town and having a good 
time. I do recall many late night parties

08:01.786 --> 08:12.902
discussing not only the football fortunes, but 
the future of the then football coach. But in 1967,

08:12.882 --> 08:23.497
I was about 10 years old, we came to a football game 
on my birthday and Texas A&M won the game. We went

08:24.659 --> 08:30.267
back to the Ramada Inn with a class of 45 
traditionally gathered in a party room. and there

08:30.247 --> 08:33.392
wasn't much discussion. There wasn't much talk 
about the coach or the football team and the party

08:34.073 --> 08:39.762
was over about 1030. That was a distinct 
impression on me as opposed to many previous trips

08:39.802 --> 08:54.685
where we had not won the game and the party went on 
till 2 and 3 in the morning with many discussions

08:39.802 --> 08:54.685
about you know how we were going to turn things 
around. My impressions of A&M early on, Haskell,

08:54.665 --> 09:21.617
were such that it represented something I wanted 
to be a part of, something that I didn't really take

08:54.665 --> 09:21.617
advantage of in high school, and that was an 
involvement, an opportunity to participate, an

08:54.665 --> 09:21.617
encouragement to participate by students, 
faculty, staff, administrators, and quite

08:54.665 --> 09:21.617
frankly, maybe an expectation that when you came 
to A&M as a student, you were expected to be

09:21.597 --> 09:28.531
involved and to contribute to the success of the 
university. That was not my high school

09:29.132 --> 09:31.617
experience whatsoever. So I saw that as a young 
man. I witnessed it. I came to A&M in the early 70s to

09:36.727 --> 09:43.099
see friends who had graduated prior to me, and my 
impressions of A&M were one of an all-inclusive

09:43.079 --> 09:48.965
welcome atmosphere. There wasn't a lot of who's 
who or where they're from or what their father did

09:49.846 --> 09:59.817
or what kind of car they drove, where they lived, 
what kind of clothes they wore. It was just more

10:00.899 --> 10:02.821
welcome. You're an Aggie now. We're all Aggies. 
Let's go get a hamburger or pizza. That was a bigger

10:07.666 --> 10:14.120
impression on me than the academic reputation of 
the business school. I think I could have gone to

10:15.644 --> 10:26.147
the University of Texas or Texas Tech where I had an 
opportunity to attend with some financial aid and

10:15.644 --> 10:26.147
probably had a similar academic experience. in 
all honesty but the reason i came to a m was was

10:26.566 --> 10:48.743
distinctly because of the influence of my father 
and the impressions that i had over that nine or ten

10:26.566 --> 10:48.743
year period from 1966 to 1975. now you came as a 
transfer student correct were you a civilian or in

10:26.566 --> 10:48.743
the corps i was a civilian i i wanted to be in the 
corps to be honest with you But having not come as a

10:49.398 --> 11:05.243
freshman, I had heard horror stories about 
frogging in, and therefore I lived in Moore Hall

10:49.398 --> 11:05.243
where some Laredo friends lived and just 
immediately got involved in the dorm life.

11:06.424 --> 11:09.089
Describe living in a civilian dorm in those days. 
Oh, it was great. It was a great experience. It was

11:10.831 --> 11:12.794
everything I expected. It was everything I wanted 
it to be. It was a lot of what I had witnessed in the

11:15.098 --> 11:27.912
early 70s, the camaraderie, the involvement, the 
total immersion into campus life. I just can't

11:28.033 --> 11:33.138
imagine having a better experience at Texas A&M. I 
am glad that I didn't take an opportunity to live

11:34.019 --> 11:43.570
rather cheaply, almost rent-free, off campus 
with some Laredo Aggies at the time. It was a great

11:43.550 --> 11:45.714
experience for me, no doubt. Describe how you 
academically got your courses. What was the

11:53.287 --> 11:59.337
transfer system and registration and all that? 
Well, let me go back in time and say that becoming a

11:59.537 --> 12:05.187
business major was not my decision. With my

12:06.213 --> 12:21.546
background in the outdoors and involvement in the 
Future Farmers of America in high school and my

12:06.213 --> 12:21.546
love of agriculture, I actually had an interest in 
majoring in agriculture. I had an FFA opportunity

12:23.568 --> 12:25.590
scholarship. I had a public speaking 
scholarship. All of this was basically to major in

12:32.716 --> 12:35.038
agriculture. and at Texas A&M in one particular 
scholarship. And my father talked to me very

12:39.059 --> 12:46.550
seriously about my background and said, you know, 
you've got a pretty good background in ranching

12:39.059 --> 12:46.550
and the outdoors. Why don't you major in business? 
And then if you really want to ranch or have a

12:50.336 --> 12:58.548
significant interest in coming back to ranch or 
something, get you a master's in agriculture. But

12:58.568 --> 13:00.351
why don't you start off in business? And I'm glad he 
talked me into that because I came to A&M and got

13:02.153 --> 13:10.127
into the marketing department and absolutely 
loved that. It fit my background. The transfer

13:13.132 --> 13:19.945
aspect was somewhat paved for me by a fellow named 
Ed Cooper. At the time, I believe his title was Dean

13:21.147 --> 13:26.997
of Admissions, and we no longer have a Dean of 
Admissions per se. Ed Cooper was a family friend,

13:27.449 --> 13:36.139
had come to Laredo on several hunting trips and 
shopping sprees and tying back to the Cadillac

13:27.449 --> 13:36.139
bar. I do not recall this, however, Ed Cooper has 
told me on many occasions that his first

13:36.780 --> 13:57.405
introduction to me as a young boy was seeing me 
cleaning out spittoons and sweeping and

13:36.780 --> 13:57.405
polishing the bar rail at the Cadillac bar and 
witnessing firsthand what he called my

13:36.780 --> 13:57.405
industrious, hardworking nature. So he was quite 
a champion of mine in my process to transfer to A&M

13:57.385 --> 14:03.959
and made it rather easy for me. And I just don't 
recall any real challenges to getting into Texas

14:05.001 --> 14:10.613
A&M. And so you started off as a business major. 
Correct. Describe your reaction to classes that

14:14.682 --> 14:19.371
first semester. That was a bit of an eye-opener. 
Although I graduated from a large high school,

14:22.558 --> 14:32.337
graduated with almost 600 in my class in 1975, I'd 
never attended a class with 300 people in it. So to

14:32.317 --> 14:49.001
walk into a accounting 229 class in a theater style 
setting with a stage and a microphone and speaker

14:32.317 --> 14:49.001
system and a slide screen with 250 people in it was a 
bit intimidating to me. I consequently used that

14:49.682 --> 14:53.127
as a pretty good excuse to to not do well in the 
class, and in fact took 229 again. Made a D in it my

14:59.318 --> 15:14.625
first semester at A&M, but took it again and made a B 
and then flourished in accounting 230 and so on,

14:59.318 --> 15:14.625
but a lot of my first recollections of classes were 
relative to the level of competition I was now up

14:59.318 --> 15:14.625
against. not necessarily to the demanding nature 
of the subject matter. The reading or the actual

15:20.975 --> 15:26.083
material in the text was not intimidating to me. 
What was intimidating to me was all of a sudden

15:26.323 --> 15:37.901
being thrown in with kids who were all more 
aggressive, smarter, harder working, and had

15:26.323 --> 15:37.901
better study habits than I had. Did it matter as a 
civilian student that you were a transfer? No,

15:41.567 --> 15:42.368
sir. If it did, I was never made aware of it. And how 
did you, as a transfer, get accustomed and

15:45.432 --> 15:51.520
acquainted with all kinds of Aggie traditions? 
Well, that goes back probably to my upbringing

15:52.381 --> 15:54.885
once again. You know, with my dad being a member of 
the class of 45, a rather proud class at Texas A&M, I

15:54.925 --> 16:03.877
was introduced to traditions early on. In fact, as 
a freshman in high school, I remember keeping a log

16:07.863 --> 16:24.960
of activities at A&M that I witnessed either in 
trips with my father or reading the newspaper,

16:07.863 --> 16:24.960
used to follow sports scores, used to follow any 
headline that involved Texas A&M. And I kept

16:26.062 --> 16:28.487
somewhat of an Aggie diary. knowing that I wanted 
to probably go to A&M and hope to be accepted, so I

16:28.467 --> 16:55.064
actually had a bit of a scrapbook regarding A&M, 
its traditions, any changes that were ongoing,

16:28.467 --> 16:55.064
construction, things that I could predict that I 
might enjoy when I got there in the fall of 75, which

16:28.467 --> 16:55.064
subsequently I did not, but looked at a lot of 
things in terms of anticipation. So I was

16:55.425 --> 16:57.107
introduced to A lot of history and traditions 
early on. That first semester, as you look back on

16:59.693 --> 17:13.746
it, were there any counselors and or teachers that 
were important to your life that first semester or

16:59.693 --> 17:13.746
first year? Some by default. I was majoring in 
marketing, as I said. The head of the department

17:18.465 --> 17:22.468
was a fellow named Sam Gillespie. And I had not done 
real well my first fall semester at A&M.

17:29.595 --> 17:31.737
Accounting 229 was a major reason for that. And 
went to see Sam Gillespie at his request at the end

17:33.018 --> 17:36.461
of the semester. And was lectured somewhat about 
my dedication to my studies. and tried to do a

17:44.388 --> 17:52.400
little better in the spring and got a letter from 
Sam telling me that I was not necessarily A&M

17:44.388 --> 17:52.400
material. So I went to see him and he was not 
encouraging and tried to tell me that that I would

17:53.381 --> 18:03.156
be better served by maybe returning to Laredo 
Junior College.

18:06.325 --> 18:14.755
In retrospect, that was maybe a good conversation 
for me because it pointed me down the hall to a man

18:06.325 --> 18:14.755
named Herb Thompson. And Herb was the antithesis 
of Sam Gillespie. Herb was encouraging. Herb saw

18:22.545 --> 18:36.282
value in my experiences and treated me like the 
18-year-old that I was and simply talked to me in

18:22.545 --> 18:36.282
terms of what I really wanted out of this 
experience at A&M and did I want a degree. from

18:36.262 --> 18:53.882
college and how would I use that and did I want to be a 
marketing major and just spoke to me in a very

18:36.262 --> 18:53.882
mature way but a very conversational way not as a 
professor of marketing so to speak but as a friend

18:36.262 --> 18:53.882
who wanted to see me succeed. I would be pleased and 
just quite frankly elated to go on record as

18:53.862 --> 19:08.662
crediting Herb Thompson with a lot of the 
influence, positive influence, in my academic

18:53.862 --> 19:08.662
career at A&M. Now did you and your buddies pick up, 
were there still nicknames for faculty members?

19:16.412 --> 19:18.655
Share some of those you recall. Well, I'm trying to 
think of some of the ones that I probably ought to be

19:20.035 --> 19:24.686
on record with here. Did Herb Thompson have one? 
No, he didn't. I don't remember one. No, if he did, I

19:28.115 --> 19:29.598
don't. And Sam is too recent. He didn't get one, I 
don't think. Now, we had some ugly names for some of

19:32.425 --> 19:36.154
those guys, but... Dr. Dan the Great Point Man was 
still here, and he was one of my favorites. Judge

19:43.663 --> 19:50.711
Stewart was teaching business law, and the judge 
was a guy that everybody tried to sign up for. And I

19:50.891 --> 19:59.962
don't, you know, really until the end of semester, 
I don't know that I could have told you what his

19:50.891 --> 19:59.962
first or last name was. All I knew was during 
registration in the summer of 1977, it was

20:06.914 --> 20:35.807
emphatic that you sign up for the judges course and 
uh and i did and that was a great course for me

20:06.914 --> 20:35.807
business law 312 and uh and what what made it such an 
important course he uh held up the book on the first

20:06.914 --> 20:35.807
day of class and said has anybody bought the book 
and i think four or five people had bought it by that

20:06.914 --> 20:35.807
first day i being one of those and he said well 
that's nice he said would y'all be willing to share

20:06.914 --> 20:35.807
that with the rest of the class on occasion And I 
nodded my head, and he said, because I'm going to

20:35.787 --> 20:42.066
talk a lot. And he said, you're going to learn more 
from me than you'll ever learn from reading that

20:42.648 --> 20:46.118
book. And while that might have seemed a little 
arrogant at the time, it was prophecy. It was

20:51.653 --> 20:52.515
accurate. And it was indeed the most engaging 
class I probably had at A&M. He made business law as

20:57.422 --> 21:03.992
interesting as you can in terms of real-life 
experiences. And while most of his tests related

21:04.853 --> 21:13.366
to text material, it had practical, real-life 
applications. And so that's what I recall about

21:13.787 --> 21:16.611
that class. Describe the routine of a typical day 
of classes for you and your buddies. What time did

21:23.251 --> 21:28.540
y'all get up and what did you do when?

21:30.062 --> 21:33.067
I was probably a throwback maybe in many ways. I 
scheduled as many classes as I could early in the

21:33.648 --> 21:38.356
morning. Having that agricultural upbringing, I 
wanted the balance of my day to be available for

21:42.663 --> 21:47.131
what I needed to get done. I sought every 8 o'clock, 
9 o'clock, 10 o'clock class I could. And most of my

21:55.467 --> 22:00.216
mornings were filled with classes. And the MSC was 
a very popular venue for social or academic

22:00.196 --> 22:08.035
opportunities, whatever. That was kind of the 
midday gathering place, the watering hole, if you

22:08.055 --> 22:12.666
will. And it was not only a place where my buddies 
went. but it was probably the one universal

22:17.898 --> 22:28.615
opportunity during a weekday to meet a young lady 
or to have an excuse to study with the young lady.

22:29.777 --> 22:45.002
And there was no other, other than maybe Sabisa 
Hall for lunch, a common ground to socialize and at

22:29.777 --> 22:45.002
the same time benefit your academic pursuits. The 
afternoons, I hate to admit this on the record, but

22:44.982 --> 22:56.959
were usually spent back at the dorm in bull 
sessions or watching TV or just hanging out as we

22:44.982 --> 22:56.959
used to do. And athletics was a big part of my life 
and intramurals therein played a big part and that

22:57.780 --> 23:07.935
was usually a late afternoon activity. And then it 
was usually something at Sabisa by 5 30 or 6. That

23:13.042 --> 23:14.364
was a big routine. And that was another social 
opportunity because while you might go over and

23:15.045 --> 23:25.040
eat within the span of 20 or 30 or 45 minutes at the 
most, Sabisa was an hour or hour and a half

23:15.045 --> 23:25.040
experience. And it was usually relative to 
something other than eating. It was the

23:29.406 --> 23:32.050
challenges of getting the certain food you wanted 
back to the dorm, or the silverware you needed to

23:32.030 --> 23:42.736
complete your set, or the tray that you needed, or 
the glass that you didn't have for your

23:32.030 --> 23:42.736
toothbrush. So there were other things that 
Sabise offered as a side note. That was kind of the

23:49.192 --> 23:50.335
day. And then if I did some really hard line 
studying, it was usually in the late hours, 8

23:50.395 --> 23:56.972
o'clock, 9 o'clock. In the dining hall, did you 
civilian students use Aggie slang for the food?

24:02.064 --> 24:02.706
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We picked up on a lot of 
the old core terminology. And, you know, shoot the

24:06.235 --> 24:16.805
blood was a common phrase you heard when you needed 
the ketchup, or a deal, which was a piece of bread.

24:18.607 --> 24:24.653
What were, as you recall, what were some of your 
favorite mess hall, dining hall foods? Shoot the

24:25.333 --> 24:27.295
blood was one of my all-time favorites. Pass the 
dirt, which was the pepper. Well, but then I'm

24:31.399 --> 24:33.802
talking about the dishes. Oh. Well, you know, 
coming from Laredo, I was starved for Mexican

24:35.632 --> 24:39.498
food. There was no Mexican food, in my opinion, in 
Cebisa Dining Hall. My buddies used to kind of

24:46.307 --> 24:57.844
anticipate my concoctions because I would 
introduce them to things that, quite frankly,

24:46.307 --> 24:57.844
this region of the country had not seen yet, such as 
fajitas. Dr. Frank Litter's class of 43 got to know

24:59.627 --> 25:05.335
me through Ed Cooper, and had me out to his house in 
the fall of 1976 because he heard that I could do

25:05.315 --> 25:17.693
something with a skirt steak that he'd never seen 
as an animal science professor in all his days. I

25:19.075 --> 25:21.619
didn't regard it as any big deal. I simply showed up 
one weekend coming back from Laredo on a Sunday

25:21.839 --> 25:30.732
night with what we called a fajita and soaked it in 
some Italian dressing and threw it on a barbecue

25:31.471 --> 25:55.993
pit and I brought some flour tortillas back from 
Laredo and some avocados and some onions and I was

25:31.471 --> 25:55.993
hailed as you know quite the chef for that 
experience and so my buddies picked up on that and

25:31.471 --> 25:55.993
of course fajitas are revolutionary now but Back 
in 1976, that was a real treat to these people. It

26:00.880 --> 26:04.285
was $1.89 a pound butcher's cut of meat. And so 
going back to Sabeza, there were times when people

26:05.387 --> 26:13.179
would ask me, what are you going to do with the 
tortilla today? I'd go over and slap something in

26:13.439 --> 26:20.850
it and introduce them to what is now, I guess, known 
as a burrito or a breakfast taco. They'd never seen

26:20.830 --> 26:26.461
scrambled eggs put in a tortilla with hot sauce. 
And so while that was very common to me, it was

26:26.481 --> 26:33.815
interesting to see the faces of people who were 
trying something for the first time. Now did you

26:34.416 --> 26:37.421
and your buddies play games in the dining hall? Oh, 
a few. We had one, I guess, There's a known food

26:40.928 --> 26:49.603
fight that is memorable to me prior to a home game on 
a Friday night. And I don't know that that's

26:50.144 --> 26:57.216
continued, but the Friday night prior to a home 
football game was often the rowdiest night of the

26:58.951 --> 27:05.508
week in Sebesa Dining Hall and much anticipated. 
That was the one day of the week where at 5.30 or

27:06.009 --> 27:14.310
5.15, I think as I recall, when the doors opened to 
Sebesa, There, in fact, was a line to get in. It

27:16.672 --> 27:26.581
might have had something to do with the fact that 
you might have had a date on Friday night before a

27:16.672 --> 27:26.581
home football game, and that involved a 7 or 8 
o'clock time. But for the most part, male, female,

27:27.842 --> 27:35.970
Sabisa was a tremendous party on Friday nights. 
And yes, there were food fights, and yes, there

27:35.990 --> 27:44.297
were games, and a lot of activity up until 7.30 when 
the dining hall closed. What was the typical

27:44.277 --> 27:52.853
dress, apparel, for a young man and civilian 
student in those days? Oh, I hate to admit this to

27:52.873 --> 27:57.721
you, Haskell, but too many tight clothes. Too many 
tight clothes. Too much influence, I guess, from

27:59.885 --> 28:08.040
Saturday Night Fever, which came out, I think, in 
1976.

28:09.995 --> 28:12.018
Bell-bottoms, t-shirt.

28:14.843 --> 28:16.285
I wore boots quite a bit. In fact, as an interesting 
side note to this interview, my first college

28:16.365 --> 28:33.032
roommate in Moore Hall at Texas A&M was matched up 
with me by virtue of my boots. I got to Moore Hall the

28:33.012 --> 28:42.124
first day students could move in on a Tuesday 
afternoon, drove up from Laredo, checked in. I bet

28:43.006 --> 28:47.672
there weren't five students in the whole dorm, 
including the resident advisors. And got very

28:49.495 --> 28:53.580
well situated, which is my nature. And by 
Wednesday or Thursday, I was touring the campus

28:53.981 --> 29:02.192
and getting my feel for what I was going to be doing 
when classes started. And on Friday, I was

29:02.172 --> 29:05.457
expecting a roommate to show up. I don't recall his 
name. Thompson, I think, was his last name, and he

29:06.658 --> 29:08.801
never showed up. On Sunday evening, I had two young 
freshmen knock on my door, and they were made aware

29:10.764 --> 29:20.598
that I did not have a roommate. And as a transfer 
student, not only do I not have a roommate, but I'm

29:21.520 --> 29:27.548
on the first floor in a corner room. Hmm. which was a 
coveted, coveted situation. And surprising to

29:32.205 --> 29:37.934
me, as was detailed to me, that a senior hadn't 
already taken that over. But these two young

29:39.036 --> 29:43.683
freshmen knock on my door, and they are not 
roommates. However, they want to be roommates.

29:46.868 --> 29:51.315
And they detail for me that they have an option for 
me. that they are living on the fourth floor, and

29:51.295 --> 30:12.460
one of them has a roommate who is willing to move 
out, and they thought he would be a good match for me

29:51.295 --> 30:12.460
because they had seen me walking down the hall with 
a pair of wingtip boots, and they said, he wears the

29:51.295 --> 30:12.460
same boots you do. and y'all must get along y'all 
must have similar backgrounds he has a deer mount

30:12.845 --> 30:42.615
in his room and you have a deer mount in your room so i 
agreed to visit with him and see what went on and uh

30:12.845 --> 30:42.615
turns out his name was vance mitchell he was a 
sophomore as i was from edna texas and we became

30:12.845 --> 30:42.615
immediate friends and we lived together for the 
better part of a year and a half until he moved out

30:12.845 --> 30:42.615
into an apartment But I thought that was an 
interesting story. Describe what was – how was

30:44.798 --> 30:48.144
that room furnished? What was in that room? Oh, the 
typical bunks that you could dismantle and

30:49.646 --> 30:54.473
arrange. But my next roommate came along. His name 
was Kevin Baker, and he was in the class of 80. And he

31:01.905 --> 31:07.894
and I had this wild idea to build a very popular – bed 
at the time that was popular around campus known as

31:08.431 --> 31:22.508
a loft and we built a loft allowing us to bring a 
couch into the room and set up the room in a
