WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:09.275
Oh, I wanted to talk a little bit about the New Deal 
and Roosevelt. The president comes in in 1933, and

00:09.295 --> 00:22.153
your family is basically a conservative one, yet 
he fundamentally changed American government

00:09.295 --> 00:22.153
and the system with the New Deal. I was wondering 
about your political persuasion. What did your

00:27.284 --> 00:28.886
father think? What did you people think about the 
New Deal, about Roosevelt? Did it have any impact?

00:33.872 --> 00:37.436
Did it seem like it had any impact on you at all? I 
can't remember any kind of impact. As party

00:41.521 --> 00:52.735
affiliations, you know, we were all Democrats, 
but I don't recall Papa ever saying you know, one

00:52.917 --> 00:59.504
way or another that it was the right thing or the 
wrong thing, because he wasn't that really

00:52.917 --> 00:59.504
involved in politics. In other words, your father 
was not only not involved in politics, but he was

00:59.564 --> 01:07.913
not, he never received any federal assistance 
like so many other Americans did during that time.

01:08.233 --> 01:08.453
No. Wish he had, but he hadn't. No, he didn't 
receive any federal assistance at all, and didn't

01:10.896 --> 01:14.460
seek it. No, he didn't seek it. And I don't remember 
making, ever remember him making any comments

01:17.543 --> 01:22.468
about want to take advantage of the New Deal thing.

01:29.136 --> 01:33.941
He wasn't politically motivated that way. Just 
work. Yeah, right. Now, you never thought of going

01:36.483 --> 01:42.429
to another institution besides A&M? Well, I had an 
offer to go to Baylor University on a scholarship.

01:47.014 --> 01:47.334
You did? Well, tell me about that. Well, my high 
school coach was a Baylor graduate. And he wanted

01:53.735 --> 01:57.078
me to go to Baylor. But I told him, I'm sorry, but 
Papa wants me to go to A&M. And I'll go there if I have

02:03.324 --> 02:05.807
to work. But Baylor is basically a conservative 
school. And so your father didn't, nevertheless,

02:09.890 --> 02:14.034
he still thought. Said A&M because of the military 
aspect. OK. Speaking of military, did you ever

02:17.798 --> 02:23.083
think of going to West Point?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.344
Not till I got to A&M. After my freshman year, I 
thought about West Point because my roommate, my

02:29.485 --> 02:41.938
sophomore year, had an appointment to West Point. 
Who was that? It was Lloyd White from Texarkana,

02:42.959 --> 02:45.562
Texas. And he couldn't pass the physical. His 
chest didn't meet the required measurement. And

02:55.835 --> 03:01.261
so they told him to come back in a year, and they 
would reconsider his application. And so he was

03:01.902 --> 03:06.727
talking to me as my roommate my sophomore year to go 
with him. And I gave it some consideration. And

03:09.750 --> 03:12.533
every morning, I would make him get up. He was a 
little bitty fellow. I'd make him get up and get in

03:13.514 --> 03:21.623
front of the window and do deep breathing 
exercises every morning. And so he passed the

03:22.227 --> 03:29.334
physical, but then he also had a chance to go to 
Annapolis, so he went to Annapolis instead.

03:29.975 --> 03:33.759
Instead of Army, he went to, instead of West Point, 
he went to Annapolis. And that was the only time I

03:33.779 --> 03:39.385
ever thought about going to any kind of military 
academy, was his . Okay, what were your first

03:39.405 --> 03:43.189
impressions when you arrived at A&M? 1939, wasn't 
it? Right.

03:51.303 --> 03:53.145
It was different. Had you ever been, ever visited 
the campus before? I visited one time prior to

03:56.248 --> 03:59.051
that. I went to see my brothers. They were in 
Mitchell Hall. And I'm sorry, at Lauren Puryear.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.681
Jimmy was in Lauren Puryear. And I was the only one 
to see him. And

04:12.644 --> 04:17.749
I didn't see much of the campus then because we went 
to see him, and then we went to the basketball game

04:17.999 --> 04:22.325
that night, and then we'd come on home the next day. 
But my first impression of A&M was just great. I

04:26.592 --> 04:30.197
couldn't believe it, that I was going to come to 
A&M.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.189
Not because of the school, because of the 
facilities. You know, my own bed, my own room, my

04:38.229 --> 04:44.698
shower, and... In other words, it was almost an 
increase of living standards for you, would you

04:46.028 --> 04:51.576
say that? I would say that, sure. Matter of fact,

04:54.380 --> 05:03.855
one reason why we love the Y so much is because the 
first shower I took in my life was at the YMCA.

05:06.218 --> 05:14.230
When I was growing up, I can remember, Terry, I can 
remember when I was a little kid, Mama washed me in a

05:14.665 --> 05:17.829
wash tub. We didn't have really much. You didn't 
have indoor plumbing. We had indoor plumbing, but

05:21.534 --> 05:24.077
we didn't have a tub. We had indoor plumbing, but we 
didn't find any. Then Papa improved the bathroom

05:27.601 --> 05:30.925
facilities. But I never had a shower at home. I 
always had a tub. The first shower I took was at the

05:35.711 --> 05:42.299
Y. I really, really love the Y. Oh, yeah, I do. All my 
brothers love the Y. But back to your question

05:44.804 --> 05:54.133
about A&M, I was just happy to be there. Just 
delighted to be there. Felt so good. How, in what

05:59.398 --> 06:12.870
way, I mean besides the fact that you had your own 
room or you know you shared a room and you had really

05:59.398 --> 06:12.870
good facilities, what do you mean it just felt good 
to be there? I knew I was going to get a good

06:13.525 --> 06:16.148
education. I was going to get a good education, and 
A&M was a man's school. Well, did you like that

06:24.035 --> 06:25.176
idea? That it was all-male school? It didn't 
bother me. Did you like it or dislike it? Liked it. I

06:33.064 --> 06:35.626
liked it because it was all-male school. I guess 
because as a kid in high school, I didn't have any

06:43.073 --> 06:49.740
money or car or anything to take the girls out, so I 
didn't really chase the girls. I had girlfriends

06:52.343 --> 07:00.992
all right, but I didn't chase them and didn't 
entertain them like I would today if I had a chance.

07:01.012 --> 07:10.903
But

07:01.012 --> 07:10.903
just being all military and all male and getting an 
education at A&M, I was so happy. I thought it was

07:13.874 --> 07:19.041
the greatest thing that ever happened to me was to 
go to A&M as a freshman. Just great, just. I was in

07:21.344 --> 07:23.526
awe by it, really. Now what unit were you placed in? 
I was in A Battery Field Artillery my freshman

07:25.289 --> 07:30.695
year. And then my, the rest of my three years I was in 
H Battery Field Artillery. I was in the same

07:40.010 --> 07:42.193
battery my brothers were in. Janelle and Jimmy 
were in A battery. And then when Andrew came up the

07:45.717 --> 07:49.862
next year, he got in A battery. All four of us were in 
A battery, field artillery. And then the school

07:54.829 --> 07:59.294
moved me over to H battery. They reorganized field 
artillery. So I stayed in H battery the rest of the

08:02.679 --> 08:04.721
term. Tell me about hazing. What would you want to 
know about hazing? Well, what kind of hazing? What

08:13.915 --> 08:14.656
did they do? They whipped my butt with a board. 
That's what they did. And I shook their hand when I

08:20.381 --> 08:23.103
got through and said, thank you. And we had rap 
sessions, sophomore on top of freshman. And they

08:33.573 --> 08:38.738
aired us out in the middle of the night. Get us out of 
the dormitory. Hazing in respect from

08:42.063 --> 08:46.969
upperclassmen to freshmen. Make us walk down the

08:48.050 --> 08:57.842
hall crab-like until we were about to die. Made us 
sit in the corner on top of a sword. Really? An

09:03.049 --> 09:06.533
imaginary sword. Oh. With your arms extended like 
this. knee bends and stuff. And then we'd do

09:11.004 --> 09:16.732
push-ups and knee bends and all kinds of 
exercises.

09:18.715 --> 09:30.311
Thinking back on it, did you think that the hazing 
that you had in the late 30s and early 40s, do you

09:18.715 --> 09:30.311
think that was a positive or a negative aspect of 
A&M? At the time, I think it's positive. It was

09:33.535 --> 09:34.216
positive. I thought it was part of the school, part 
of the tradition, part of the training. Mm-hmm. It

09:38.911 --> 09:39.812
didn't bother me. Oh, it didn't. It did not bother 
me. I took it and didn't like it. I took it. I think

09:46.620 --> 09:47.841
this is the training. I didn't like it at all. I used 
to fuss and gripe about it when I got along. But I'd

09:56.651 --> 10:07.804
say, well, this is part of the system, part of the 
education, part of the discipline and the core.

10:08.071 --> 10:08.952
You accepted it? Accepted it. Tell me about your 
colleagues. What kind of people were they? My

10:16.103 --> 10:17.164
contemporaries? Yeah, your student colleagues. 
People in the Corps. The freshmen or the... Yeah.

10:23.533 --> 10:26.658
When you first got there, you were a freshman. 
Well,

10:26.678 --> 10:30.984
everybody like I was. They weren't quite as 
physically active as I was. I was out for the

10:34.890 --> 10:37.133
freshman basketball team, so In fact, I was out for 
the freshman football team. Made the freshman

10:39.916 --> 10:42.680
football team quit. Really? Yeah. Why'd you quit? 
I got hurt. John Kimbrough and Robinette and

10:45.524 --> 10:53.556
Arnold Pannell and that bunch, they just ran over 
me a couple of times, and I was just too small for

10:45.524 --> 10:53.556
them. My picture's in the annual on the freshman 
team, freshman football team. At that time, if

10:58.683 --> 11:05.232
you're on a part-time scholarship, any kind, you 
played all the sports. All of them? All of them. So

11:08.062 --> 11:13.027
as a basketball scholarship, I had to play 
football. And then- Even if you didn't- No, no, I

11:13.388 --> 11:18.172
never played football in my life. Do you remember 
an interview about high school? I was a

11:20.895 --> 11:24.259
cheerleader, and I was basketball and swimming. I 
never played football, and made the first team.

11:27.442 --> 11:28.623
Gee, what position? Backfield. Willie Zablack, 
Dub, Dub, Willie Zablack's now coaching at Texas.

11:36.852 --> 11:36.972
Mm-hm. And Dub Sibley and all this bunch of, we were 
all in the backfield. Dub was the center. But I made

11:44.524 --> 11:47.608
the team and didn't like it. Didn't want to play. 
Papa didn't know I was playing. Papa knew I was

11:51.253 --> 11:52.275
playing. Boy, he whipped me good. But he didn't 
want me to play football. But I had to. He didn't

11:57.422 --> 11:58.483
want you to get beat up? Yeah. He thought I was too 
small. I didn't weigh but 155 pounds and 5 foot 8.

12:04.532 --> 12:06.334
And so...

12:07.968 --> 12:16.679
In the middle of the practice one day, Ernie Panel 
and Marshall Robinette, leading interference

12:07.968 --> 12:16.679
for John Kimbrough, just ran over me. And I said, 
this is it. I'm not going to play. And I got up off the

12:20.124 --> 12:27.694
field and I walked towards the locker room and 
Coach Homer Norton, head coach, hollered at me,

12:20.124 --> 12:27.694
hey, Cokie, where are you going? And all I could do 
was wave. He said, come on back here. And I just, no.

12:34.002 --> 12:34.903
So when I got to the When I got to the locker room, 
Bubba Dimmitt, the trainer says, here, take my

12:35.457 --> 12:40.362
stuff. Don't ever give me an oblong ball anymore. I 
want a round ball, basketball. And I quit. And

12:47.508 --> 12:52.293
Coach Norton was about to take away my basketball 
scholarship. Really? Yeah. Because they wanted

12:54.855 --> 12:55.916
me to play. And Coach Corot, my basketball coach, 
who was also the football coach, intervened and

12:56.817 --> 13:03.844
said, no. let him just play basketball. So I got 
relieved of that. And so my contemporaries were

13:12.030 --> 13:19.999
all, they were just typical high school kids 
coming in. I was about a year or two older than they

13:20.019 --> 13:25.045
were. And so we got along great though. Do you 
remember what kind of benefits you got from a

13:27.067 --> 13:33.114
part-time scholarship?

13:33.134 --> 13:33.915
Yeah, I got

13:37.878 --> 13:38.939
$20 a month.

13:42.463 --> 13:44.745
And also, they gave me a job in a mess hall. I was a 
mess hall waiter for four years. Even after I got

13:49.230 --> 13:58.460
more money playing basketball later on, I stayed 
in with my job as a waiter in a mess hall. I liked it.

14:00.242 --> 14:06.889
And the people I waited on liked me, so I enjoyed it.

14:07.763 --> 14:13.390
They took one football scholarship, Terry, and 
split it up into five basketball scholarships.

14:13.410 --> 14:14.191
That's what they did. Scholarships for A&M 
basketball were not like the other day. No. Oh, no.

14:22.481 --> 14:27.508
But I had a good group of freshman classmates. 
Could you live on 20 a month? No. The meals were $35 a

14:32.474 --> 14:34.497
month. Oh, really? Yeah. And how about tuition? 
Did they give you tuition? They gave me my tuition.

14:44.239 --> 14:46.401
So $20 a month and they gave you a free tuition? 
Tuition. But you had to buy your books and run the

14:47.422 --> 14:49.584
board. And expenses and everything. And

14:52.707 --> 14:57.852
then I worked in the mess hall. And then I did other 
odd jobs. Took up tickets to football games. What

15:05.037 --> 15:07.280
position did you play in the basketball team? I was 
a guard. I was a quarterback, what we called

15:09.663 --> 15:11.926
quarterback guard then. I brought the ball down 
and controlled the game, controlled the passing,

15:11.946 --> 15:21.018
and passed it into our postman.

15:22.180 --> 15:25.764
I haven't looked at those figures, but how good was 
the team back then? Oh, we beat the national champs

15:26.425 --> 15:30.210
in 1941. We beat Rice University. They were the 
national champs. Really? And we beat them. We were

15:35.227 --> 15:38.991
about, I think that year we came out third in the 
conference. We had a pretty good team. We didn't

15:40.692 --> 15:43.074
have any substitutes. In fact, we were called the 
Five Ironmen of Southwest Conference. Five of us

15:47.378 --> 15:48.960
played all the time. You only had five people? 
Well, first five. Then we had about four or five

15:52.223 --> 15:55.546
substitutes. Very much. In fact, I played every 
game, every minute of the game when I didn't get

15:58.108 --> 16:02.112
fouled out. I hold the record for the most fouls in 
Southwest California.

16:07.849 --> 16:08.970
I was all over them. You tackled them. I was all over 
them. I was all over them. Oh, yeah. Yeah, whenever

16:14.095 --> 16:19.220
the coach wanted to keep somebody from shooting, 
he'd put me on him, and I'd hold him down. I was a good

16:19.240 --> 16:21.643
guard, as short as I was. I could

16:22.244 --> 16:28.470
hold a man down, keep him from shooting. and do a 
pretty good job not hurting him, just guarding him

16:29.733 --> 16:34.058
around. Now let's turn back to the Corps for a 
minute. I want to find out what were the things that

16:36.060 --> 16:43.948
you liked about the Corps and what were the things 
that you disliked about the Corps? I liked the, I

16:45.450 --> 16:51.636
didn't mind the marching, marching to meals. I 
liked that and I liked the chain of command.

17:02.453 --> 17:06.178
You mean you liked the idea that you always knew who 
was... In charge. In charge. Yeah. Like the first

17:08.081 --> 17:11.266
sergeant, juniors, you know, and seniors. I liked 
that. And...

17:22.382 --> 17:23.583
I just... I just liked it. Cool. I just really liked 
it, you know. Now my dislikes were... See, I... I

17:33.132 --> 17:35.775
disliked one of the things, they didn't let us 
study enough. They didn't let us study enough. I

17:41.882 --> 17:49.151
wanted to study and god dang the damn sophomores 
would come in and harass us and send us on details.

17:49.852 --> 17:51.614
Just didn't study enough. And I was a pre-med 
student, so I was taking science courses. You

17:55.599 --> 17:58.262
thought that you were going to be a medical doctor? 
Don't kid me. I got a degree in science. Yeah, I know

18:01.455 --> 18:02.216
that. Yeah, yeah. And I planned to be a doctor. Of 
course, my mama influenced me to be a doctor. Oh, I

18:08.184 --> 18:09.085
didn't know that. Yeah, her grandfather was a 
doctor in Greece. And so you went there with the

18:13.070 --> 18:19.599
idea of not becoming an engineer and not staying in 
the military, but with the idea of becoming a

18:13.070 --> 18:19.599
doctor. Well, that's right. And what dissuaded 
you away from becoming a medical doctor? The Army.

18:27.284 --> 18:33.431
They, of course when I graduated, I went to the Army 
and when I come back, I tried to get in medical

18:27.284 --> 18:33.431
school. When I got back, oh yeah. Which one? I tried 
Texas, Baylor, Tulane, Creighton up in Des

18:35.894 --> 18:45.446
Moines. Des Moines, in Iowa. Oh, okay. Yeah. No, I 
mean Omaha, Omaha, Nebraska. Creighton's up

18:49.731 --> 18:51.013
there. I tried that because I had a friend, doctor, 
who tried to get me in. Oh, that's a sad story. I

18:57.675 --> 18:58.816
don't know if I'll tell you or not. I got accepted to 
Bail a Man. You did? Well, why didn't you go? I was

19:03.081 --> 19:07.627
accepted in April, and in 1st of June, I gave... 
What year was this? 1948. And they wrote me a

19:08.968 --> 19:11.692
letter. They said, we'd like for you to come back to 
see Dean Morrison. He wants to have an interview

19:17.038 --> 19:19.241
with you. So I went back over there to Houston. It 
was in And he told me they overpicked the class. And

19:26.253 --> 19:28.615
I was the last five they overpicked. So I couldn't 
enroll. I said, OK, if I was overpicked, that puts

19:33.340 --> 19:36.924
me first for next year. He said, oh, no, you got to 
apply all over again. So I applied all over again

19:39.967 --> 19:45.173
and wasn't selected anymore. I wasn't selected, 
so I never did get in. And then that's when I got in

19:49.858 --> 19:52.000
the insurance business. If you turn your tape off, 
I'll tell you why I didn't get in.

20:00.130 --> 20:02.353
What about the other universities? 
Academically, I couldn't, I didn't meet some of

20:02.874 --> 20:08.662
their requirements. Now, Tech University said, I 
met them, my academic grade was good. Everything

20:15.412 --> 20:16.173
was fine. My med, what is it, med sac? Medical 
boards or whatever. No, the med sac test. Yeah.

20:23.570 --> 20:24.631
MedPAC, MedSat. Anyway, the medical aptitude 
test was good. But they said I'd been in the war. And

20:30.939 --> 20:39.609
my mind wasn't really acclimated to civilian life 
and I should go back to college for three years and

20:30.939 --> 20:39.609
then come back to them. And I said, no, I can't do 
that. Golly. In fact, the war matured me. I said,

20:44.995 --> 20:46.196
I'd be a better student. That sounds like 
discrimination because you were Because I got

20:51.160 --> 20:52.101
shot. I got wounded. And they said, no, your mind's 
all messed up and everything. I said, you better go

20:57.429 --> 20:59.172
back to college. For three years. They wanted me to 
go three years and then come back. I said, no. Yeah,

21:05.241 --> 21:06.683
Dean Bailey. I remember over here at Texas 
University. I remember that well. And then when I

21:11.270 --> 21:16.678
went up to Omaha, to Creighton, the dean said I was 
too old. I was 27 or 28 years old. I was too old. So

21:21.164 --> 21:26.412
about four years, and then two years internship, 
that's six years, I'd be, what, 33? 34, 35

21:26.452 --> 21:30.940
years old? So, it was, you know, everybody had 
their reasons. And it was frustrating. Yeah, it

21:35.647 --> 21:39.153
was frustrating, so then I decided I won't try it 
anymore. And I got an insurance business. Do you

21:43.099 --> 21:45.062
feel bad about it? You wanted to be a medical 
doctor. You studied a science background at A&M.

21:50.713 --> 21:54.619
Did you feel really let down or that you couldn't do 
that? No, I don't. I feel good. I really do. I

21:57.724 --> 21:59.907
wouldn't have met my wife. I wouldn't have all my 
kids and the business and enjoy the community

22:00.028 --> 22:06.238
spirit here in Beaumont. Oh, no. It doesn't bother 
me. It doesn't think. It was just a good

22:08.922 --> 22:10.765
experience. I mean, you know. And, no, I I wouldn't 
have been involved in the military like I have

22:14.388 --> 22:17.352
been. Everything happens for the best. So those 
are some of the things that you like and some of the

22:22.440 --> 22:26.846
things that you dislike about the Corps. What 
about a position? You were a leader ever since

22:27.828 --> 22:30.952
fifth grade. What about a position of leadership 
in the Corps? Were you a leader in the Corps? I was

22:36.781 --> 22:43.551
not on the staff of any unit or anything.

22:44.408 --> 22:46.130
I don't know why, come to think about it. Yeah, I 
don't know. Because you were on the staff of some of

22:46.591 --> 22:47.972
the other things. Some of the other things, yeah. I 
don't know why. And I made A's in military A&M,

22:50.416 --> 23:00.949
where I was an average student in my other grades, 
sciences, chemistry, and zoology. Yeah, now that

23:01.389 --> 23:13.024
I think about it, I had never thought about it that I 
was what they call a one-button in, you know,

23:01.389 --> 23:13.024
lieutenant in the unit. But I was... Never on the 
staff or anything. Okay. In what ways did thinking

23:17.113 --> 23:31.588
back about your career, not only in the military 
but also in the society and the insurance

23:17.113 --> 23:31.588
business, in what ways did the Corps help you and in 
what ways do you think it hindered you, if any? It

23:31.608 --> 23:32.209
helped me. It helped train me to be 
self-disciplined. Okay. It helped me, if I had a

23:40.577 --> 23:43.120
job to do, to do it. and to do the best job I can with 
it. It helped

23:49.210 --> 23:55.816
me to understand my fellow man, too. In what way? At 
A&M, in the Corps, when I saw some of the freshmen

23:57.338 --> 24:13.292
who, you know, it was pretty hard for them to take 
some of this hazing, I felt for them. You know, I

24:13.492 --> 24:17.336
wanted to help him. And I would. In the same way in 
the military. I wasn't a hard-nosed officer type

24:23.021 --> 24:32.630
who just ran over you because I knew I could run over 
you. But I felt a little respect for the man. I don't

24:38.795 --> 24:39.836
care what he was. I tried to help him. And yet I 
maintained my disciplinary position.

24:50.708 --> 25:00.940
Because that's the position I held, and I was 
trying to uphold that, regardless if I was a

24:50.708 --> 25:00.940
captain, or a major, or a lieutenant colonel, or a 
general. More so, when I got to be a general, I was

25:00.960 --> 25:07.627
more

25:00.960 --> 25:07.627
understanding. Well, why do you think that is? I 
guess because you're older? Older. Older. Yeah.

25:17.403 --> 25:25.473
And also, they look at you differently, too, as a 
general as they would a colonel or lieutenant

25:17.403 --> 25:25.473
colonel. They look at you with more respect and 
more admiration. And so if you feel that coming

25:29.077 --> 25:39.810
from the others, then you've got to respond to it in 
a more of an understanding manner, a more...

25:40.465 --> 25:45.292
humility, a compassion type thing, as a general 
officer. And I was a hard driver. I drove. I mean, I

25:50.701 --> 25:54.586
was aggressive all the way up the line.

25:57.751 --> 26:00.776
Because I believed in doing the job and doing it as 
best I could. And I pushed hard. But when I got to be a

26:03.740 --> 26:09.409
general, I wasn't hard. I looked at it a little bit 
differently. Of course, I was looked at

26:16.328 --> 26:18.731
differently.

26:21.454 --> 26:32.047
When I was battalion commander, we had three or 
four other battalion commanders, field

26:21.454 --> 26:32.047
artillery commanders in the division. And I had to 
work hard because it was very competitive. with

26:37.756 --> 26:38.978
these other commanders. I had to shoot better than 
they did. I had to move better than they did. I had to

26:41.822 --> 26:42.904
communicate better. That's it. Shoot, move, and 
communicate. That's field artillery. And so I

26:47.571 --> 26:51.838
worked pretty hard. In fact, Butler was one of the 
commanders. Yeah. Yeah, he was in the same

26:55.764 --> 26:58.148
division I was with. Did he mention that to you, 
that we were together? I guess he did. Yeah, he

27:02.383 --> 27:05.466
probably did, but I did his interview last summer. 
Oh, gosh. See, Kidwell was our division

27:07.168 --> 27:09.470
commander. But the A&M— So the Corps helped you in 
those ways, but did it hinder you in any way, do you

27:10.932 --> 27:17.639
think? Was there anything that—usually this is a 
difficult question. Did it hold you back, or did it

27:21.482 --> 27:28.249
hurt your career or advancement in any way, do you 
think? Let me say this, it helped me for me to

27:30.254 --> 27:34.359
understand the chain of command. A&M helped me 
there. As far as hindering and hurting,

27:39.165 --> 27:46.294
gee, I don't know. I can't, I don't know where it 
could hurt me. Okay, fine. Except maybe while I was

27:51.300 --> 27:58.149
in the Corps, I didn't devote enough time to my 
other studies. Right. Yeah. Except, now that's

28:00.325 --> 28:18.144
the day and end, but after I got out, I can't recall 
any time where the Corps gave me any bad points, you

28:00.325 --> 28:18.144
know, in the military or in life or anywhere. Okay. 
Now this is kind of interesting that you were a

28:19.025 --> 28:22.509
leader before you got to the Corps. During the 
Corps you weren't. Did you think that the Corps had

28:23.990 --> 28:30.197
any effect on your becoming a future leader, a 
general?

28:33.451 --> 28:40.322
I never thought of it when I was at A&M, why I wasn't 
on a leadership spot. I just, I guess my time was

28:40.342 --> 28:48.394
taken up by being a leader on the basketball team. 
Satisfied, satisfied my... Because you were. I

28:52.908 --> 28:53.469
was. That's right. You ran the basketball team. I 
ran the basketball team. That's right. Because

28:58.093 --> 29:05.319
some of the generals that I talked to ran some part 
of the Corps, and because you were an athlete, you

28:58.093 --> 29:05.319
ran the basketball team. I ran the basketball 
team. So I was satisfied as far as being envious of a

29:06.320 --> 29:16.169
person being on the brigade staff or regimental 
staff or battalion staff. So it really didn't

29:16.769 --> 29:19.232
bother me. I wasn't ever jealous of someone's 
position. Now there has been talk, especially

29:23.603 --> 29:36.761
during the Vietnam War, I think was the most recent 
time in American history, but before that, of the

29:23.603 --> 29:36.761
so-called military mentality. People in the 
military think a certain way. They have the same

29:39.685 --> 29:40.766
idea. All the bureaucrats think the same way, all 
the people in the military. Do you think there is a

29:43.950 --> 29:48.817
so-called military mentality?

29:50.299 --> 29:52.682
There is, but not with A&M men. Because I line that 
up with stereotyped thinking. And A&M men are not

29:58.884 --> 30:02.388
stereotyped thinking on the whole. Now, there may 
be some exceptions. The military in Vietnam,

30:06.072 --> 30:14.762
that show was a regular Army show. It wasn't a 
reserve show. Okay. But I don't want to just, I

30:19.469 --> 30:22.873
mean, I don't want to just use Vietnam. Yeah. I 
just, but what I'm interested in is just this idea

30:23.293 --> 30:29.000
that people in the military think a certain way. 
I've heard this before. That's right. Like people

30:30.401 --> 30:32.703
in the bureaucracies, they all think the same way. 
And some people in the students, they all think the

30:32.764 --> 30:36.167
same way. Everybody stereotypes everybody. And I 
was wondering if you thought that there's such a

30:38.570 --> 30:42.474
thing as this military mentality. There is. And 
what is it? Could you define it?

30:51.522 --> 30:54.626
I don't know how you would define something like 
that, Terry. Well, what does someone in the

30:54.646 --> 30:59.331
military think versus the way other people think? 
They have no flexibility. Oh, okay. So part of it

31:01.554 --> 31:02.855
is... It's an adjustment to the situation. They 
come up on a situation and they say, this is the

31:05.859 --> 31:09.163
solution, period. Boom. That's military 
thinking. When it could be, if they would give it

31:12.247 --> 31:20.196
some adjustment, I mean, some thinking and 
evaluation and, and some, it could be other means

31:20.547 --> 31:31.202
to accomplish what they want to do without just a 
stereo 1-2-3 army type. Yeah, there is military

31:31.803 --> 31:34.567
mentality. I run across that lots of times. And you 
think that the A&M officers aren't, they don't

31:38.172 --> 31:46.023
have this mentality as much as other officers? Is 
that what you were saying? That's what I'm saying.

31:47.645 --> 31:48.867
They don't have this... A military mentality. 
That's what makes an A&M

31:51.145 --> 32:02.346
graduate a good officer because he's not set in 
concrete in his military thinking. Okay. He's

32:03.287 --> 32:04.229
more flexible. More flexible. He tries to get the 
best solution, not the solution. Okay. Not the

32:08.998 --> 32:10.180
Army solution. When people talk about military 
mentality, they also talk about the Army way or the

32:10.717 --> 32:20.393
Army solution to a problem. But an A&M man, you say, 
is more flexible. More flexible. What was your

32:27.003 --> 32:34.395
opinion of your professors back at A&M from 1939 to 
1943?

32:38.577 --> 32:39.678
Well, I liked them all. Of course, I was trained to 
like your teachers and like your professors.

32:44.585 --> 32:45.386
That's the way I was raised. Papa raised us that 
way. You know, respect for your teacher. And I

32:50.953 --> 33:01.667
don't know of any outstanding teachers except 
one, I guess, Dr. Ichfeldt, my English professor.

33:02.788 --> 33:03.349
He amazed me. One day he walked into class, first 
day he walked into class, and 33 of us were in there,

33:03.429 --> 33:08.095
and he called the roll. He made us all hold our hand 
up, and he looked at us, and then he turned the roll

33:09.425 --> 33:17.018
upside down, and he called everybody by name. 
After that, oh, that impressed me more than

33:17.038 --> 33:22.588
anything in the world. Dr. Ickefeldt, English 
professor. I think he still lives on campus. He's

33:26.555 --> 33:27.236
retired. But I was, I don't know. Did you feel that 
the education prepared you for the future?

33:39.650 --> 33:48.261
Looking

33:39.650 --> 33:48.261
back, yeah, I guess it did. Of course, I was taking 
the pre-med course. It didn't prepare me for the

33:52.686 --> 33:57.372
insurance business, except it trained my mind, 
education. I had a prof. Yeah, I'll give you an

33:58.693 --> 34:02.958
adverse remark. Dr. Potter. was my pre-medical 
advisor. And he didn't like the idea that I played

34:07.466 --> 34:11.750
basketball. I would, at 5 o'clock, I'd close my lab 
book up or my cap, put it away, and, where you going,

34:11.770 --> 34:19.698
Mike? I'm going to play basketball. Now, either 
you're going to play basketball or be a doctor,

34:20.779 --> 34:24.123
what? I said, if I quit basketball, I can't go to 
school because I need the scholarship to... So he

34:30.049 --> 34:31.350
didn't... So... He taught me to have a little 
humility for people, not to be so hard on you. He was

34:43.746 --> 34:46.449
hard on me, hard as he could be. In fact, I think he 
was mean, come to think about it. Really? Yeah, he

34:50.274 --> 34:52.376
was mean to me. And he was my pre-med advisor. I had 
to get his recommendation to get medical school.

34:59.765 --> 35:00.466
And I didn't get it. Really? No, he wouldn't give it 
to me. Even though my grades were, you know,

35:03.601 --> 35:06.264
average, good. He wouldn't guess, no. Which I 
thought was unfair. Yeah. Why would he be your

35:13.131 --> 35:15.674
advisor if he wouldn't help you out in the future? I 
don't know. He was, that school designated him as

35:16.495 --> 35:21.260
our pre-med advisor.

35:22.542 --> 35:33.574
Let's talk for a minute about, in the Army, the 
quality of A&M graduates versus West Point

35:22.542 --> 35:33.574
graduates versus ROTC from other institutions. 
Could you compare those? Yes, very easy. You could

35:39.131 --> 35:53.711
always tell a West Point graduate because he was 
really stiff, and I'm not using this as a cliche,

35:39.131 --> 35:53.711
but he was stiff, wasn't warm, and sort of an ego 
type thing. And then the other ROTCs just didn't

35:55.153 --> 36:03.004
have the military discipline that A&M ROTC 
graduates had. Dress, courtesies, bearing. I

36:12.806 --> 36:15.450
could spot them. I could tell. Because I had staffs 
of mixed Georgia Tech graduates, Auburn

36:17.032 --> 36:24.343
graduates, A&M graduates, and I could tell. Yet 
they were just as intelligent as an A&M graduate or

36:25.084 --> 36:32.535
West Point, but they just didn't have the military 
barracks. And yet the West Pointer had the

36:35.138 --> 36:38.342
military band, but he went beyond that. He was sort 
of a zealot? Kind of pompous? Pompous type.

36:46.792 --> 36:48.595
Couldn't talk to him. You couldn't talk to him 
about anything except military. And then they

36:52.880 --> 36:55.904
weren't too versed on that except what they 
learned at West Point. They always talked about

36:56.024 --> 36:58.747
West Point. But

37:02.198 --> 37:04.741
A&M, man, you can talk to them about anything. 
Business, world affairs, government. And when

37:08.305 --> 37:12.890
you got the military, he knew just as much about the 
military as the West Point man did. Or more. The

37:15.072 --> 37:29.708
field artillery, I know in the field artillery, 
when I went to report in my first division, 8th

37:15.072 --> 37:29.708
Armored Division, as a field artilleryman, I had 
to teach the West Point graduate how to fire a small

37:15.072 --> 37:29.708
T. Really? Yeah, he didn't know. Didn't they have 
practical training like that? Not at West Point.

37:38.268 --> 37:40.391
They sent them to school at Fort Sill. While at A&M, 
they trained you for four years as an orfeal

37:41.693 --> 37:45.419
artilleryman. And they did send you to Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma, the artillery school. But the West

37:52.269 --> 37:59.340
Pointer, he just didn't have that specialty of 
that. And same thing about infantrymen or

38:00.299 --> 38:06.527
cavalrymen or coast artillery or the engineers at 
A&M. They knew their field. They knew. That was

38:08.749 --> 38:10.311
their branch, and they knew it. But even the other 
ROTC schools knew more about their specialty than

38:12.193 --> 38:21.905
the West Point. When you were out in the field, who 
would you rather have as your officer? What type?

38:27.312 --> 38:29.074
The West Point ROTC or an Aggie? Which one would you 
rather have? Aggie. I preferred Aggie all the

38:31.375 --> 38:33.037
time. And when you were a general, which one? 
Aggie. Aggie again. Oh, yeah. One time I had a field

38:38.626 --> 38:43.092
artillery battalion, all Aggies, except one 
Georgia Tech graduate. Really? That's right.

38:45.095 --> 38:48.820
They all come back from Korea, right here in 
Beaumont. Sixteen officers, all Aggies except, I

38:50.303 --> 38:56.732
beg your pardon, one Georgia Tech and one Texas 
University graduate. Dick Coffin was a

38:57.404 --> 39:01.051
University of Texas graduate. And Ralph Coker was 
a Georgia Tech graduate. All the rest of the

39:04.377 --> 39:06.321
Aggies. Oh, not that I'm prejudiced for Aggies, 
but they were just better officers or better men

39:06.341 --> 39:15.077
than Russ Point. Now I've often heard from a lot of 
generals and from a lot of A&M alum, that A&M is not

39:18.397 --> 39:30.252
just an institution of higher learning, but it's 
more than that. Do you agree with that? It is more

39:32.074 --> 39:33.156
than that. Oh, what is it then? It teaches you to be a 
man. What is it? It teaches you to be a man. You know

39:38.002 --> 39:39.824
what it teaches you to be? A take-charge man. Take 
charge. Like, they can say what they want to

39:44.009 --> 39:47.914
about... Our secretary of state. But he took 
charge. This is what an Aggie would do. He would

39:55.240 --> 40:00.685
take charge until someone says you're not in 
charge no more. He'd take charge. So

40:02.987 --> 40:15.557
that's what I think one of the great assets about 
being an Aggie is that they teach you to be in

40:02.987 --> 40:15.557
control, to have control of the situation. Okay, 
what about the Aggie spirit? The Aggie spirit? You

40:19.045 --> 40:20.727
can't touch it. It's the greatest thing in the 
world.

40:26.535 --> 40:28.718
You get two or three Aggies together, I don't care 
where they're at. That's the Aggie spirit.

40:31.061 --> 40:36.749
There's a bond ship there that no other school can 
touch it.

40:42.096 --> 40:43.578
Anything, anything they do. I was in the Battle of 
the Bulge. And I was directing artillery fire on

40:47.142 --> 40:52.108
the infantry, the German infantry. And we began to 
get shelled. And so I fell to the ground, laid my

40:54.090 --> 40:57.915
arms out there. Next thing I knew, there was 
another guy flopped himself right beside me, and

40:58.436 --> 41:07.847
he put his hand next to my hand, which had the Aggie 
ring on, and he had an Aggie ring on. No kidding.

41:08.968 --> 41:09.469
That's right. And I turned around, and I looked at 
him, and I said, I'm Lieutenant Coconose. He says,

41:17.450 --> 41:19.492
I'm Colonel Story. He says, you Pete's brother? 
That's my brother Janelle. I said, yeah, I'm his

41:23.257 --> 41:25.259
brother. He said, well, I'll be damned. We were 
classmates at A&M. How's old Pete doing? Right

41:30.164 --> 41:31.786
now, I don't care what he's doing. I want to get out 
of here, Colonel. He said, oh, just sit here tight.

41:35.110 --> 41:37.212
He was a commander in the 94th Division. We were 
replacing him in the line in the ballot. So the

41:40.315 --> 41:45.202
Aggie spirit, you know, he saw me laying there. 
Yeah, he saw me laying there and I had my ring on. He

41:48.207 --> 41:50.630
plopped his hand right there beside me. But the 
Aggie spirit is just, I don't think anybody can

41:51.612 --> 42:03.930
claim the camaraderie that goes with that Aggie 
spirit. In what way do you think that A&M changed

42:04.230 --> 42:09.478
your life?

42:09.982 --> 42:24.860
Just

42:09.982 --> 42:24.860
uh, you talking about just at A&M? Just going, just 
that educational experience at A&M, in what ways

42:26.802 --> 42:38.436
do you think that it changed from before until now?

42:40.002 --> 42:42.605
I don't think it changed my life. I think it 
enhanced my life. I think my daddy, my papa, and

42:46.430 --> 42:52.558
mama put me in the right direction. And going to A&M 
enhanced it, enlarged it, educated me.

43:07.036 --> 43:08.878
It just made me more make me more worldly. Because I 
was right here in Beaumont. I never left Beaumont

43:13.930 --> 43:17.014
until I went to A&M.

43:19.538 --> 43:37.202
I

43:19.538 --> 43:37.202
don't

43:19.538 --> 43:37.202
know how I could more answer your question and 
change my life. It's just... Well, it made you more

43:38.322 --> 43:39.864
of a world leader. It really did. Oh, yeah. That's 
good, now.

43:46.093 --> 43:47.154
It's just A&M. A&M just,

43:48.336 --> 43:55.265
uh... I don't know. A&M was A&M, you know.

44:03.797 --> 44:08.143
Is there anything else that you want to talk about 
A&M before we move on to your military career? I

44:08.967 --> 44:11.991
mean, is there something that I missed that we 
should talk about here? Let's see.

44:17.399 --> 44:18.901
Well, we talked about the core life. We talked 
about the athletics. We talked about... Well,

44:21.865 --> 44:36.105
personally,

44:21.865 --> 44:36.105
I think A&M is the greatest university in the 
world. academically, a corps, or what. It just

44:39.838 --> 44:47.386
gives you an education that you can't get anywhere 
else. In my time, the fellowship,

44:47.666 --> 45:04.004
the closeness that you had with your fellow corps, 
the spirit of corps, the Agnes Spirit, the silver

44:47.666 --> 45:04.004
taps. Gosh. Made goose pimples all over you to hear 
silver taps at midnight. Midnight yell practice.

45:13.178 --> 45:19.387
And you know, the girls didn't play a big part in my 
life at A&M. They played a part, but

45:19.467 --> 45:27.439
there weren't any women there, you know. And so we, 
you know, it was just a bond ship that you build up at

45:27.780 --> 45:34.510
A&M I don't think no other school has

45:35.030 --> 45:40.877
it. I would say this, without A&M, I don't think I'd 
be in this position today. I don't care what school

45:48.465 --> 45:50.488
I'd have gone to. I don't care what school I'd have 
gone to. All right. In other words, now we're

45:54.733 --> 45:59.118
getting back to that question, in what ways did A&M 
change your life? Change your life, yeah. So now

46:01.080 --> 46:04.564
you're going to switch around and say that it did. 
Yeah, yeah. Because you don't think that you'd be

46:07.421 --> 46:12.768
where you are today if you went to another 
university. I don't think I'd have got this

46:13.950 --> 46:17.716
rounded education that I had. Yeah, I guess you're 
right. It did change my life. Let me say, it didn't

46:22.663 --> 46:24.345
change my life. It probably,

46:24.926 --> 46:33.138
well, I mentioned it enhanced my life. OK. It gave 
me more opportunities.

46:40.410 --> 46:43.254
A&M gave me more opportunities I wouldn't have 
gotten anywhere else. So

46:43.434 --> 46:49.402
I guess you're really right. Okay, let's leave it 
at that and move on to your military career. Now,

46:54.829 --> 46:56.992
when were you called up? Right after you 
graduated? Can you tell me how you got in?
