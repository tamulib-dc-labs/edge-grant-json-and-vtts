WEBVTT

00:03.693 --> 00:07.156
I think we were talking about senior boots and how 
much they cost. I think seventy-five dollars. And

00:08.838 --> 00:13.102
of course then you had to buy the breeches to go with 
them. Oh, that wasn't standard issue? No, you had

00:15.024 --> 00:17.647
to pay for that. That wasn't government issue. So 
you not only had to buy the boots, but you had to buy

00:21.831 --> 00:25.375
the breeches. And the summer breeches and the 
winter ones. So there was that expense. So it was

00:32.077 --> 00:34.299
not an inconsequential thing. How did you and your 
senior buddies, what special care did y'all give

00:35.260 --> 00:42.106
to those people? We took care of them. They always 
had a special place in the room. The big decision

00:50.154 --> 00:54.998
was, when your senior year was over, what were you 
going to do with it? Everybody wanted to keep it,

00:55.018 --> 00:58.161
but we all needed the money. And I sold mine, and I 
don't remember who. Do you remember how much you

01:01.507 --> 01:06.191
got for them?

01:07.192 --> 01:07.292
No. During your senior year, about how often did 
you wear those boots?

01:14.037 --> 01:18.161
Gosh, well, every parade function. Every 
football game? Every football, oh yeah, every

01:20.163 --> 01:25.267
football game. And if you were out of town or on a 
date or something like that, you'd want to be sure

01:25.287 --> 01:31.412
to wear them. every opportunity you could without 
being just gauche about it. And you hadn't yet met

01:36.553 --> 01:40.277
this special girl from Waco? No. Well, yeah, I had. 
Virginia and I met that one quarter I went to Beto

01:42.760 --> 01:50.869
when my folks were living up in the ranch, but it 
never materialized until later.

01:53.632 --> 01:57.737
Let's see, do you remember going to Muster on 
campus?

02:00.974 --> 02:04.618
I don't have a specific recollection of it. And 
that may be because of a muster I made. I don't know

02:11.586 --> 02:13.008
whether I'd come home. I don't have a specific 
recollection of the muster. I do have my 53 Union

02:18.594 --> 02:20.136
muster. Oh, that was fantastic. Right, you're 
senior ring. Oh, big deal. How much did it cost? I

02:29.306 --> 02:29.867
want to say it. It was less than a hundred. How did 
you feel when you put that on? Oh man, big deal. Why

02:38.654 --> 02:43.220
are Aggie rings special? I think one of the reasons 
is that you can get it only if you go to school and

02:43.260 --> 02:52.050
satisfy certain requirements. You can't go to the 
jewelry store and buy it. You can't go to the

02:54.613 --> 02:57.856
bookstore and buy it. It just has that tradition. 
Have you ever lost yours? No, never have. Any good

03:06.753 --> 03:10.418
ring stories about where somebody saw it? No, but 
it saved my finger one time. I was in the tank, and

03:13.262 --> 03:24.997
the hatch fell, and it hit the ring, and if it hadn't 
been for the ring, I lost my finger. I remember

03:25.017 --> 03:27.681
that, because I bent it a little bit, and I had to get 
it straightened out. Then your senior year final

03:29.467 --> 03:32.211
review. Very emotional. Describe how, why. Well, 
of course, you know it's the end of it. And of

03:45.091 --> 03:50.599
course, at that time, the war had already started 
in Korea. And I knew, you know, step off campus.

03:55.226 --> 03:57.189
This is May of 1950. No, I didn't graduate until 
August. August of 50? Yeah, August of 50. Oh, so the

04:00.941 --> 04:02.402
war just started then? The war just started in 
June. So it had, I had taken a regular, it was

04:04.865 --> 04:13.373
offered and took a regular commission.

04:13.393 --> 04:21.741
But, you know, there was, that sort of put a, 
several of us had gone off to, you know, interview

04:13.393 --> 04:21.741
for jobs and things like that. I know I went to 
Dallas and interviewed with P&G. And then the war

04:27.367 --> 04:28.768
started. your future all of a sudden was totally 
changed. There wasn't any choice about where you

04:31.840 --> 04:36.685
were going to go or what you were going to do. So it 
had that kind of feeling about doing it because you

04:36.705 --> 04:46.273
knew you were going to have to do it immediately. 
But it was an emotional time. Did parents come, did

04:52.058 --> 04:58.384
family come for final review and commencement? 
See, graduating in August, there was final

04:58.820 --> 05:06.188
review, but my parents didn't come up. I think 
maybe, I started to say that, I think maybe my

05:06.368 --> 05:11.494
parents came up one time for Mother's Day. And I'm 
pretty sure my mother was there. So, did you ever go

05:15.178 --> 05:20.043
across the stage for commencement? To get my 
diploma? Not to get a diploma. I don't think they

05:25.429 --> 05:26.650
had it. I did go to get commissioned. I got a picture 
of that. Now that was done in the spring? No, that

05:33.052 --> 05:35.876
was done probably in August. Oh really? Yeah. 
Alright, as you and your buddies were, during your

05:38.380 --> 05:53.362
senior year, as you all began to talk about the 
future, how well prepared did you think A&M had

05:38.380 --> 05:53.362
made you for the future? What did you think? I felt 
good about it. because I had that offer from P&G,

05:57.173 --> 06:01.219
which was a good offer. I didn't know what I wanted 
to do really, but John Taylor and I were good

06:02.280 --> 06:08.690
friends all through school. We both went to P&G and 
both of us were made offers. What was the

06:12.735 --> 06:23.210
foundation for your optimism about the A&M 
education, the A&M preparation?

06:25.273 --> 06:27.096
I think I would say that it was an awareness that a 
graduate of A&M was well regarded. I think A&M had a

06:35.605 --> 06:43.276
good reputation in the, quote, marketplace.

06:43.396 --> 06:45.319
We felt more so than other schools. And I don't know 
whether that was really true, but that was kind of

06:46.360 --> 06:58.197
the feeling we had, fed to us really by former 
students. He always felt you were going to get a

06:58.413 --> 07:03.120
fair break.

07:06.145 --> 07:19.204
As you look back now,

07:06.145 --> 07:19.204
what preparation did A&M give to you for the real 
world? What was special about A&M? What evidence

07:24.553 --> 07:26.175
did you find? I don't know that this is a fair view of 
it, but I think you've got an appreciation of how

07:27.235 --> 07:40.130
people can work together. It was less of a 
frat-type school, if that's one way to put it. We

07:48.801 --> 07:49.922
were pretty serious. I mean, we had a lot of good 
times, and that's all right, but I think the whole

07:50.282 --> 07:55.909
campus was serious about its education. Maybe 
that was flavored by the fact that there was some

08:00.272 --> 08:05.078
other veterans. But I think we always felt we got a 
good education. Obviously, some schools were

08:10.666 --> 08:13.509
better than others. I think the business school 
was marginal at best. Looking back on it, I don't

08:16.153 --> 08:18.656
know what it was. But there was still enough

08:18.676 --> 08:26.706
goodness, if that's the word, about the other 
disciplines and the guys you were with. You knew,

08:31.509 --> 08:41.058
for engineers, you know, I roomed with an 
engineer, you knew what the difficulties were and

08:31.509 --> 08:41.058
the disciplines that they went through. You felt 
that anybody who came through and got a degree

08:41.078 --> 08:53.129
there had earned something and that it was well 
regarded on the

08:41.078 --> 08:53.129
outside. Did A&M help you get that P&G offer? Did 
A&M help people get jobs there? They did have a

08:58.630 --> 09:03.578
placement service, certainly nothing like it is 
now. And I'm trying to think who was in charge of it.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.888
I don't want to say Wendell Horsley, but that may 
have been when I was on the staff. I don't know

09:09.968 --> 09:13.815
whether Wendell was there when I was in school or 
not. Again, that was all King's accident at the war

09:14.476 --> 09:22.208
study for those of us who were in the

09:14.476 --> 09:22.208
Corps. What creates Aggie spirit, Aggie

09:23.032 --> 09:36.130
loyalty? That's a good question.

09:39.555 --> 09:48.347
I think it's a respect for the institution, a 
respect for people who have immerse themselves in

09:50.825 --> 09:56.130
the institution in whatever form they choose.

09:58.812 --> 10:08.682
I think it is the recognition of the continuity of 
fellowship for camaraderie. And there's a

10:10.764 --> 10:17.250
singleness of association. There was. I don't 
know now whether that's still the case or not. But

10:21.739 --> 10:32.729
at that time, it was really, we kind of flew 
together because there wasn't anything else to do

10:21.739 --> 10:32.729
there. We were perforce united at a location 
pursuing, in a sense, our own individual goals.

10:47.153 --> 10:51.038
pursuing it in concert with a lot of other people. 
And I don't know as the school has grown if that's

10:51.058 --> 10:55.444
still the case or not. While the go home machine was 
turned off, we were talking about the

10:55.464 --> 11:01.551
inclusiveness of the student body. Describe the 
diversity of the student body when you were there.

11:10.783 --> 11:12.385
Obviously it wasn't diverse. as diverse then as it 
is now. There were no blacks on campus. There were

11:19.038 --> 11:39.599
not that many Mexican Americans, but I think that 
was probably, we probably had as many as any large

11:19.038 --> 11:39.599
state institution because you could go there and 
not have to spend a lot of money. It was not an

11:39.619 --> 11:42.962
expensive school to go to. the Mexican-Americans 
who were there were totally absorbed into the

11:43.718 --> 11:51.047
culture of the place. There was no, absolutely no 
discrimination. What about other groups, Jews,

11:54.872 --> 11:59.699
Catholics, Protestants? I don't recall any 
instance of any type of difficulty in none

12:01.701 --> 12:08.190
whatsoever. Basically, in terms of their 
economic background, can you generalize about

12:08.210 --> 12:13.236
Aggie? Most of us were from middle economic ranges 
or lower. There were a few. One guy had an airplane.

12:23.907 --> 12:24.507
Oh boy. He was the Colonel of the Corps in 51. A.D. 
Martin had an airplane. What kind? Cessna 172. He

12:36.483 --> 12:37.624
had a car.

12:40.388 --> 12:41.569
He never let it go to his head. Because one time he 
threw us all down the rail. We had a big party down

12:45.274 --> 12:47.536
the rail. But when I was on WTAW, the best guy on the 
station was the owner, Dick Gottlieb. He went on

12:55.326 --> 12:57.528
and had quite a career in radio. A Jewish. One of the 
guys on the battalion staff, his name was Gollum,

12:59.010 --> 13:10.864
went on to become, I think, a big editor with a

13:11.198 --> 13:20.830
person's religion or economic background. There 
just wasn't any. I don't know what the term would

13:23.092 --> 13:24.855
be. Were they urban or rural? I think largely 
rural. Small

13:30.542 --> 13:35.688
town. I think you're right for that. In terms of if 
we had to We're not talking about politics now.

13:46.968 --> 13:52.573
We're talking about change, receptivity, or... 
If you're not talking about politics, I would say

13:53.574 --> 14:10.131
that

13:53.574 --> 14:10.131
there was a feeling that there was a job to be done. 
You had to get through school. You were fortunate

14:12.083 --> 14:14.266
to be where you were. You didn't, you were not 
looking for windmills to tilt.

14:22.737 --> 14:23.678
That wasn't important. The important thing was to 
get all the way through school. All right, now, in

14:26.802 --> 14:29.566
politics, let's generalize. What were they like? 
Well, I suspect if they had any preference, they

14:31.108 --> 14:35.794
were mostly Democrats then. I'm going to take a 
small break.

14:43.910 --> 14:47.714
Let's go back to your senior year. Your roommate 
was the Corps Commander. What kind of routine did a

14:54.441 --> 15:00.767
Corps Commander have in those years? What did the 
Corps Commander have to worry about? About

15:03.910 --> 15:05.812
everything. His name was Doyle Aband from Laredo. 
Very modest background. He was a quantum

15:12.530 --> 15:15.454
engineering major. He was smart,

15:15.474 --> 15:20.339
mature beyond his years. He was not a veteran, but 
he was a very mature young

15:20.359 --> 15:27.448
man. He reported, of course, to Colonel Boatner. 
Boatner used him. He just delegated things to him

15:35.518 --> 15:42.486
and held him responsible for what went on in the 
Corps.

15:51.511 --> 16:14.141
Despite his very modest background, he had no 
difficulty whatsoever in talking to big people,

15:51.511 --> 16:14.141
former students, dignitaries would come to 
campus because he got called in and all that sort of

15:51.511 --> 16:14.141
thing. Handled himself beautifully. He was an 
unusual young man. Were there major crises that he

16:18.186 --> 16:20.910
had to deal with, which you would call them? Not 
that I remember. He was so highly respected within

16:24.457 --> 16:42.555
the Corps that if anything, and I can't think of 
anything specific, but if there were anything

16:24.457 --> 16:42.555
that threatened to cause a problem, he was 
sufficient unto himself to take care of it. Were

16:42.575 --> 16:46.459
there any pranks tried on the Corps commander or 
his roommate? Since I was his roommate, not on him.

16:51.282 --> 16:57.969
I used to get drowned on occasion just because of 
the battalion stuff, but I knew that. I could tell

16:57.989 --> 17:01.072
it was coming. In terms of making noise or anything 
else, was the area where y'all were in the dorm, was

17:02.013 --> 17:11.963
that kind of fish didn't bother that area very 
much? No, no, no, they didn't. I don't ever

17:14.045 --> 17:16.928
remember them coming. Describe... the routine 
for meals for the Corps staff in Duncan Binding

17:19.514 --> 17:28.763
Hall? I think we ate together. I think we ate 
together as a group. It's hard for me to separate.

17:36.110 --> 17:40.735
I'm thinking more of the time that I wasn't on the 
Corps staff, but we ate together as a group. But it

17:43.137 --> 17:47.902
would, I would say it would be very civil. I mean, we 
Did y'all get adequate helpings? We didn't get any

17:53.256 --> 17:54.438
special treatment. No, you didn't get any? No, no. 
Really? No, no. No, we didn't get any favoritism in

17:59.565 --> 18:03.912
that respect. And you don't remember his ever 
being called out in the middle of the night to work

18:03.932 --> 18:10.901
on something? No. He was uniquely qualified for 
the job. I don't know where he got his maturity. But

18:17.547 --> 18:27.900
he really, he had it and he was so highly respected 
within the Corps by the regimental commanders and

18:17.547 --> 18:27.900
by the military staff. And there was a, were you all 
aware your junior year of a comparatively serious

18:27.920 --> 18:39.174
routine of reviewing to make the Corps commander 
selection? Yes, I don't remember what it was, but

18:40.015 --> 18:45.141
he was I think they had been earmarked early in his 
junior year. Those kind of guys kind of stood out

18:51.525 --> 18:55.752
early on. Did y'all have a fish to come and take care 
of your room when you were seniors? No. No, we

19:03.344 --> 19:04.446
didn't do that. See, again, Boatner was so 
determined to stamp out any kind of hazing. He

19:12.526 --> 19:15.550
never was totally successful, but he did. And for 
that reason, no, we didn't have any of that in the

19:15.930 --> 19:21.437
course of that. Were you all careful to see to it 
that your room never had any violations or

19:21.717 --> 19:30.829
regulations? I don't think we made an effort. We 
just never did. Yeah. So it was, you know, we had a

19:35.234 --> 19:37.597
response. And again, I think the fact that during 
those years, There were so many veterans there who

19:42.783 --> 19:47.768
were so serious about their education. We, being 
the veterans, kind of lifted the maturity of the

19:47.788 --> 19:53.074
whole group. We said, without consciously making 
that, but we set an example that other guys kind of

19:53.094 --> 19:59.841
rose to. And so... Was smoking in the dormitories 
allowed then? Yes. I don't remember much of it, but

20:08.389 --> 20:11.052
it was allowed, sure. Okay, back, I don't have many 
questions left. Can you think of any important

20:16.943 --> 20:20.568
topics we have not yet included?

20:23.652 --> 20:26.636
No, no... You ask a lot of questions. You didn't 
make any whiz-bang trips to New York or California

20:27.157 --> 20:34.567
or the other side of the world or anything like 
that? No, we didn't do any of that, you know. During

20:36.610 --> 20:40.215
the summers, what did you do? Well, of course, one 
summer... Being in the Corps, we had to go to Fort

20:42.368 --> 20:44.331
Hood. At Fort Hood, how did you Aggies compare with 
the other ROTC students? We thought we were better

20:52.823 --> 20:55.327
than the rest of them by far. I'll throw this in. At 
A&M, at the time I was there, we had a couple of tanks

20:57.790 --> 21:03.939
to work with. I learned to drive a tank at A&M. Of 
course, further at Fort Hood. That saved my life.

21:12.473 --> 21:31.891
in Korea, because we lost so many people when the 
Chinese came in, and we were trying to withdraw,

21:12.473 --> 21:31.891
and we didn't have, we lost a lot of people, and I 
ended up driving, I was a lieutenant, but I ended up

21:12.473 --> 21:31.891
driving a tank, because we were 24 hours on the 
road, in the dark, mountain roads, and I knew how to

21:12.473 --> 21:31.891
drive a tank. Another point, when I went to Korea, I 
went over with six other guys, a total of six of us,

21:31.911 --> 21:41.299
all from other ROTC schools, None

21:42.730 --> 21:50.558
of them had any idea what they were up against. I sat 
down the night before we went into our battalion,

21:50.738 --> 21:57.565
and I showed them how to get into a tank and what they 
would find there, and how to shoot a machine gun.

21:57.645 --> 22:01.649
They'd never had any, they were quartermasters 
and finance people. The A&M saved my life in that

22:02.129 --> 22:04.191
sense. Do you remember when you first heard about 
the war beginning in Korea? Oh, yeah, the day it

22:10.237 --> 22:11.861
happened, you know. That was such a traumatic 
thing. We knew right away that forget about P&G.

22:18.456 --> 22:19.759
Were you here that summer? You were at A&M that 
summer? I was at A&M, yeah, because I had to go

22:20.862 --> 22:23.969
through to August to finish. And you heard about it 
on the radio? Would have to have been the radio,

22:26.842 --> 22:30.667
yeah. Since the Corps wasn't there that summer, 
did Boatner or anybody else call you? No, we

22:37.716 --> 22:41.421
weren't notified in any respect. You just knew 
intuitively what was ahead. It wasn't like, do you

22:46.771 --> 22:50.857
remember where you were when Pearl Harbor 
happened? It kind of came on, it took a couple of

22:51.318 --> 22:55.444
days to realize, hey, we're going to get into this 
thing. And from there on out, everything changed.

23:01.673 --> 23:02.394
All right, let's see. If you were a consultant

23:02.754 --> 23:15.613
to the A&M leadership today, what advice would you 
give them about

23:17.956 --> 23:20.861
continuing A&M, how to continue A&M's progress. 
What do you think A&M ought to do or not do, continue

23:21.783 --> 23:28.395
to do or start doing in the future? Oh gosh, that's 
difficult because, you know, I don't really know

23:30.599 --> 23:39.475
what all they're doing now, but I would say that a 
real concerted effort needs to be made to keep the

23:41.783 --> 23:45.668
core at A&M. And I say that just because I think it is 
so much a part of the history of the school. It gives

23:55.282 --> 24:02.492
the school a uniqueness that few institutions 
have. You've got the Citadel, and you've got West

24:03.721 --> 24:07.284
Point, Annapolis, and so on. And they have to move 
with the times. But given the patriotic speech

24:10.667 --> 24:21.937
here, we need in the armed services today people 
who come from a, quote, a civilian kind of

24:10.667 --> 24:21.937
background. I think you need that leaven in the 
military forces. And so I think A&M has a

24:26.841 --> 24:32.226
responsibility to provide that as it has in the 
past. That doesn't mean there isn't a marvelous

24:33.893 --> 24:38.860
opportunity for people who don't want to be in the 
Corps. But I think that needs to get special

24:38.880 --> 24:43.127
attention because it is a uniqueness. What else?

24:50.398 --> 24:56.847
From what I see, I think what is being done now seems 
to be the right sort of thing. I mean, institutions

24:56.928 --> 25:00.593
have to change. And I think A&M is changing 
appropriately, and of course my source is just

25:00.775 --> 25:12.175
basically the Alumni Magazine, which I think is a 
fine publication.

25:17.564 --> 25:23.374
It's going to be difficult to keep the standards 
up, I guess, except that just the physical number

25:25.210 --> 25:36.102
of limitations of students coming in is going to be 
a filter and we'll continue to have good people.

25:39.286 --> 25:48.957
I think there seems to be an effort to try and keep a 
vision ahead, try to adapt it to a terribly

25:39.286 --> 25:48.957
changing society. I think our isolation in Brazos 
County is probably a good thing in that respect,

25:50.557 --> 25:57.890
because you don't go there unless you want to go.

26:02.318 --> 26:13.477
If someone walked up to you and gave you a check for a 
million dollars with one restriction, you had to

26:02.318 --> 26:13.477
pass it to Texas A&M, but you could decide what to be 
done with it. Or if you could make a Really, big gift

26:15.565 --> 26:17.887
to A&M. What would you want that gift to do? What 
would be your highest priority projects?

26:30.961 --> 26:36.927
I think that I would put it into scholarships for 
students who went into the Corps. I think the other

26:38.268 --> 26:40.711
parts are going to take care of themselves. 
They're taking care of themselves. But I think

26:43.679 --> 26:59.855
that's so important that anything that will 
attract good people and with a commitment to the

26:43.679 --> 26:59.855
Corps of Cadets is probably as much as can be done 
for A&M with one single check. How would you select

26:59.875 --> 27:02.802
the recipients of those?

27:08.182 --> 27:21.739
I think it would have to be a combination of need,

27:08.182 --> 27:21.739
academics, and a commitment to the core.

27:22.520 --> 27:31.691
To what former students, faculty, advisors, 
etc., do you feel greatest debt of gratitude and

27:22.520 --> 27:31.691
why? Earl Rudder. Why?

27:37.763 --> 27:52.862
He is the man, as much as any one person, 
responsible for taking A&M out of a good but not

27:37.763 --> 27:52.862
spectacular institution and giving it the 
foundation for being a great institution. Who

27:53.783 --> 27:54.263
else? Perhaps to you personally.

27:59.349 --> 28:03.855
Are there others that meant something special to 
you personally?

28:06.468 --> 28:14.641
Now, of all the people that I associate with at A&M, 
Earl Rudder stands head and shoulders above the

28:06.468 --> 28:14.641
rest of them. All right, then my last question is, 
what feelings do you hold in your heart today for

28:14.661 --> 28:20.850
Texas A&M?

28:27.281 --> 28:34.652
I think I'd have to say that I was very, very 
fortunate that I ended up there. I could end up a lot

28:36.927 --> 28:40.332
of different places. And I don't think that any 
place that I know of could have given me more for

28:40.352 --> 28:51.809
what lay ahead of me than A&M did. And I still have 
many, many good friends.

29:01.604 --> 29:02.445
So I think that's it.
