WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:09.444
In the cyclotron, we had an experiment where we had a lot of detectors because particles fly out in all directions.

00:10.465 --> 00:24.182
And so when I got to thinking about nuclear medicine being a better place for nuclear physicists, well, I thought of these systems where you have a big ring of detectors

00:24.770 --> 00:26.992
like a CAT scan.

00:27.012 --> 00:36.201
And so my system, it's called positron emission tomography, it's called PET for positron emission tomography.

00:37.182 --> 00:39.444
And it has a ring of detectors.

00:40.325 --> 00:49.734
So all that we knew about detectors and how to massage the data and everything, I'd learned at the cyclotron.

00:50.014 --> 00:54.118
So I just transferred that technology over to medicine.

00:54.807 --> 01:06.282
But other people had been doing this, but I decided to use optical fibers to pick up the light from the detectors, and nobody had ever tried that.

01:07.324 --> 01:08.405
And maybe they were smart.

01:08.525 --> 01:10.728
It took me a long time to make it work.

01:12.110 --> 01:15.435
But maybe I should give the successful end of the story.

01:15.475 --> 01:23.245
My last graduate student finished about 2000, I guess, and he's working in one of these

01:26.296 --> 01:30.622
What do they call them?

01:31.283 --> 01:33.066
It's something like the Cyclotron.

01:33.266 --> 01:45.925
It does research with the sponsorship of the University of Texas, but they're not in a department at the University of Texas.

01:45.985 --> 01:47.387
They get their outside funding.

01:48.028 --> 01:50.532
Think tank, that's what I'm trying to think of.

01:50.552 --> 01:54.598
Well, it turns out this think tank is supported by the Navy.

01:55.726 --> 02:04.734
And they hired my ex-student because of his experience in what they call tomography.

02:04.794 --> 02:19.727
If you have a lot of detectors all around, and you have a source in the middle, and you detect radiation or whatever from the source, you can use mathematics to calculate where that source is.

02:21.028 --> 02:24.231
So that's why you use it in the human body.

02:24.582 --> 02:28.848
You can, well glucose for example, you can make it radioactive.

02:29.449 --> 02:49.257
When you're thinking, you burn glucose and so all the, you put radioactive glucose, stick it in somebody's arm, he starts to think and it all ends up where he's thinking and this is how you can tell where your thinking happens, where your optic nerve is and

02:49.743 --> 03:06.803
It's really a tremendous breakthrough because you know about the mind-body problem, and here you've got for the first time somebody says, I'm thinking, and then that's the mind, but then the body with a tomograph says, well, this is where it's going on right up here.

03:08.364 --> 03:19.497
Well, anyway, the Navy was interested because if they want to find a submarine that's making some noise and they pick up the sound all around using tomography, they can find where the submarine is.

03:19.763 --> 03:26.494
So they're supporting tomography and the oil companies use it.

03:26.534 --> 03:37.271
The rock where there's oil bounces sound off and that's why they can drill way under the Gulf of Mexico now where they couldn't before because they have this tomography.

03:38.293 --> 03:46.446
So anyway, they're supporting tomography and they've just agreed in the last few months to support

03:46.865 --> 03:55.557
the continuation of our tomograph here, which he did his thesis on, and we're going to transfer all the equipment the next few weeks over to Texas.

03:56.538 --> 04:01.164
And he's writing a proposal to the National Institutes of Health, which is supporting this kind of work.

04:02.426 --> 04:05.710
So it really looks promising.

04:05.950 --> 04:08.073
It has some advantages over the old methods.

04:08.674 --> 04:11.758
Now, let's see, you said you got that finished in 80?

04:12.346 --> 04:14.208
That's when I got the first idea.

04:14.248 --> 04:17.593
That's when I wrote a proposal and got money from the Cancer Society.

04:18.233 --> 04:24.461
That was 1980, and now 2000, we finally got a system that's really working like we want it to.

04:25.302 --> 04:33.132
During all of your years as an active member of the physics department, who were your closest colleagues?

04:33.152 --> 04:37.818
Well, probably the ones that I hired when I was hiring for the cyclotron.

04:38.939 --> 04:41.863
In fact, when we were having the big

04:42.130 --> 04:50.742
fight was subtle, we more or less went on strike and said we're not going to write a proposal, because this chief engineer doesn't know what he's doing.

04:51.723 --> 04:57.231
You know, everybody went on strike with me, so those have been my closest friends I guess.

04:58.513 --> 05:01.117
And some of them are retiring now.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.478
Who were they by name?

05:02.498 --> 05:02.599
Oh.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.822
Well Northcliffe died.

05:05.703 --> 05:08.627
Let's see, John?

05:10.565 --> 05:11.806
No, it wasn't John.

05:11.886 --> 05:14.329
It was Lee Northcliffe.

05:14.349 --> 05:16.050
Lee, yeah.

05:16.070 --> 05:17.471
Jack Heberts, retired.

05:18.432 --> 05:26.520
He was the one who came from Yale and went to Oak Ridge and worked on our equipment for a couple of years and then came here.

05:28.141 --> 05:37.450
And Bob Kennefic was another one that we hired at the beginning to do the first research at the cyclotron.

05:38.105 --> 05:48.757
And if you turned to anybody for suggestions, advice, evaluation of an idea, you know, what do you think of the, who would that have been?

05:49.278 --> 05:49.758
Who did you?

05:49.798 --> 05:55.064
Oh, I guess I'm kind of a lone wolf.

05:55.124 --> 06:00.831
First of all, I went into nuclear medicine, which is, I'm the only one doing it.

06:00.851 --> 06:06.137
So, and I never built up a school

06:06.522 --> 06:13.410
or try to get more faculty members, because I always had the idea that I'd start a small company and build these things.

06:14.451 --> 06:22.780
And I did start a small company and wrote some proposals, but we never got money for the small company.

06:23.360 --> 06:34.993
So the fact that I was going to move outside the department, and this is one of the big problems with universities, and I'm sure you know, that a lot of things look nice in the laboratory,

06:35.682 --> 06:40.631
But getting them out into commercial use, there's a big gap in there.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.455
And I was going to fill the gap.

06:42.595 --> 06:44.839
I had the thing working in the department.

06:45.460 --> 06:55.159
I was going to get money from a small business corporation and build some units and then start manufacturing them.

06:56.281 --> 06:58.585
Well, with that in mind, I didn't

06:59.020 --> 07:05.590
try to get assistant professors hired and, you know, like most senior professors do, I guess.

07:08.855 --> 07:16.567
Did the physics department in the 80s and 90s, were there regular meetings of the department?

07:16.587 --> 07:18.971
Did it get together as a group very often?

07:19.231 --> 07:19.612
Oh, yeah.

07:20.313 --> 07:21.314
At least once a month.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.821
You know, that's what PLOS did that was

07:26.290 --> 07:27.912
was important.

07:27.932 --> 07:30.595
He got a department that functioned like a department.

07:31.056 --> 07:34.120
Describe his manner and style of leadership.

07:36.402 --> 07:43.631
Well, it was, except most departments have what they call a chairman, and he acted more like a chairman.

07:44.252 --> 07:51.741
And I was the head of the

07:52.835 --> 07:58.862
appointments and promotions committee for a while, and we worked closely together about hiring people and things like that.

07:59.883 --> 08:06.290
Well, he's a very perceptive person and a good man to talk to about hiring people.

08:07.271 --> 08:11.335
And we talked about, well, essentially, under him, we built up the department.

08:11.375 --> 08:15.720
We have a very strong quantum optics now under Scully.

08:16.679 --> 08:19.002
There wasn't any optics when I came.

08:21.524 --> 08:28.332
Plus brought Katowar, who was in atmospheric physics.

08:30.154 --> 08:32.276
So we'd build up optics.

08:32.317 --> 08:33.177
That was the main thing.

08:33.198 --> 08:40.466
Of course, we tried to build up strong groups, and there was the cyclotron that was obviously a strong group.

08:41.086 --> 08:42.568
Then there's a theoretical group.

08:44.843 --> 08:53.411
which, well, it got a big push from the Super Collider.

08:54.392 --> 09:02.499
Somehow A&M got a million dollars or something to get professorships, and so they were able to hire some very good people.

09:02.699 --> 09:13.129
In fact, one of our best people got hired away by Michigan to start up a research institute at Michigan.

09:13.632 --> 09:22.300
Now, during the 80s and 90s, was A&M reasonably competitive in terms of salaries and so forth?

09:22.320 --> 09:31.107
Well, as far as I know, I get a little put out by, I don't think academic people are very honest myself.

09:31.127 --> 09:37.333
Whenever they start talking about salaries, they compare the salaries here with those in Boston and Seattle and California.

09:37.893 --> 09:40.816
They never mention the cost of living here is about 20% less.

09:40.976 --> 09:43.318
Yeah.

09:43.568 --> 09:48.299
I don't know, I just think it's dishonest, and it makes a big difference.

09:48.319 --> 09:52.628
Did the graduate program in physics grow during those decades?

09:52.648 --> 09:54.272
Well that's the problem now.

09:54.432 --> 09:58.000
I remember when Zener was planning ahead, and this

09:58.267 --> 10:01.851
I mean, it was the heady days when they got the cyclotron.

10:02.172 --> 10:05.376
Everybody thought the future of the world was in nuclear physics.

10:06.177 --> 10:08.199
And he was going to have 300 graduate students.

10:08.279 --> 10:09.641
I remember him proposing that.

10:10.903 --> 10:12.665
We're lucky if we get 20 now.

10:13.506 --> 10:17.711
And we're sending people out.

10:19.373 --> 10:27.463
They've taken the teaching load away from one person to go out and talk all around the state and try to round up some graduate students.

10:29.013 --> 10:30.516
It was bad when I came, though.

10:30.716 --> 10:39.394
I mean, Squire really demeaned Potter, and people heard that.

10:40.055 --> 10:42.280
And Potter had friends all over Texas.

10:43.262 --> 10:48.292
In the year after Squire became department head, we had one graduate student.

10:48.312 --> 10:49.755
That's what got Rudder's attention.

10:50.123 --> 10:53.547
Otherwise, he didn't care if anybody liked Potter or Squire or whatever.

10:53.967 --> 10:58.933
But when there's only one graduate student applies, something's got to be done.

11:00.134 --> 11:05.060
So we were pretty low to begin with, but the cyclotron gave us a big boost.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.244
A lot of people came here and wanted to work on the cyclotron.

11:08.384 --> 11:19.877
It was a competitive research facility that young Texans wanted to get involved with, that's all.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.254
We got one really good student from Rice.

11:23.314 --> 11:45.578
We don't get many from Rice or Texas, but he worked with me, and then he went, because he was very good, I got him a job with Hofstadter at Stanford, and Hofstadter was planning a big telescope on the, well, a gamma ray telescope on a satellite.

11:46.267 --> 11:53.758
And so this student, after he left Hofstadter, went to work for TRW, who was building the satellite.

11:54.459 --> 11:56.261
Well now I've got a Christmas card from him.

11:56.301 --> 12:03.752
He says, we put in a proposal for the next Hubble telescope, and if we get it, I'll be director of the next Hubble telescope.

12:05.554 --> 12:07.497
So we're getting some Aggies up there.

12:09.099 --> 12:11.683
So that's the quality of students we had.

12:12.187 --> 12:18.876
About how many in the 80s and 90s, about how many doctoral students completed degrees in physics per year?

12:19.197 --> 12:21.059
About how many doctoral graduates?

12:21.700 --> 12:25.145
Well, you've got the wrong person here.

12:25.165 --> 12:29.671
I didn't have many in the 80s because I was building equipment.

12:30.372 --> 12:40.827
I was hiring a lot of undergraduates and shop people to build it, but I didn't have PhDs until the 90s.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.290
I only had one Ph.D.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.352
in the 90s, I guess.

12:44.372 --> 12:47.657
I had a couple of master's degrees, or three or four, I guess.

12:49.500 --> 12:53.606
But other people were much more active in graduate students than I was.

12:54.287 --> 12:55.449
Let's see, fraternal life.

12:56.290 --> 13:00.396
Where did you and your colleagues, where did you all have coffee?

13:01.618 --> 13:02.840
Where did you take coffee breaks?

13:03.501 --> 13:03.621
Oh.

13:05.484 --> 13:08.729
Well, we usually ate lunch together.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.071
Where?

13:10.878 --> 13:17.646
Coach Norton's was where we started out, right across the street there.

13:19.709 --> 13:23.594
And then what happened?

13:24.094 --> 13:30.682
Well, because I left the cyclotron, a lot of the people I'd been going out to lunch with I didn't go out to lunch with anymore.

13:34.527 --> 13:35.248
I guess I

13:39.667 --> 13:43.872
I'd take a break in the afternoon, but I like to relax.

13:43.892 --> 13:48.597
When I relax, I relax by not talking to people.

13:48.617 --> 13:50.739
So I take over a magazine or something.

13:50.799 --> 13:52.601
That was the nice thing.

13:52.721 --> 13:59.729
Physics is one of the choicest pieces of real estate on the campus.

13:59.849 --> 14:03.794
It's about halfway between the library and the MSC.

14:04.214 --> 14:07.518
Did you and your buddies go to the MSC very much?

14:07.538 --> 14:09.640
Well, yeah, some of the people did.

14:09.704 --> 14:11.326
almost every day.

14:11.346 --> 14:15.570
But I'm not, there's two kinds of people.

14:15.630 --> 14:18.012
There's the pub and the club.

14:19.714 --> 14:25.580
And the pub people all get together and talk, and when I go to the catalog, they all are talking with each other.

14:25.620 --> 14:34.169
And I'm a club person who gets my newspaper and reads and don't want to be disturbed.

14:34.189 --> 14:37.112
So it's my personality, I guess.

14:37.160 --> 14:40.664
All right, let's digress back over on family life.

14:41.044 --> 14:50.595
When you and your wife and youngster got here, in what activities did you become involved in the community?

14:52.197 --> 15:03.891
Well, we went to the Baptist Church in College Station, but then we never joined because I'd been baptized and I didn't want to be baptized a second time.

15:03.911 --> 15:06.694
So then we went to the First Presbyterian Church

15:07.214 --> 15:13.141
I guess our lives were more or less centered on the church.

15:14.462 --> 15:23.512
But I remember Dick Thomas, when I first arrived within five minutes, he said, well, we don't believe in predestination.

15:24.553 --> 15:31.101
And since I did believe in predestination, that wasn't a very good advertisement for it.

15:31.121 --> 15:36.647
But it was as congenial as the Baptists just

15:37.960 --> 15:40.043
Well, I don't know.

15:41.705 --> 15:42.807
It isn't just baptism.

15:42.867 --> 15:44.469
Their style is just different than mine.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.432
The Presbyterian's more my style.

15:47.794 --> 15:57.808
And the Grace Bible Church I would have liked, but they have this, they believe in this dispensationalism, which, well, I'm a Calvinist.

15:58.829 --> 16:00.812
Alright, now did you grow up a Calvinist?

16:01.990 --> 16:06.234
Well, I grew up in a congregational church that didn't leave much of anything.

16:06.815 --> 16:10.638
It grew out of Calvinism, and we learned a lot about the Bible.

16:10.759 --> 16:22.810
We memorized the Beatitudes and the 23rd Psalm, and my mother had us learn a lot of things, but we never heard about sin or atonement or anything of Calvinism.

16:22.870 --> 16:28.656
The congregational church was all social action, and that's what

16:29.986 --> 16:37.997
attracted me to the Presbyterian Church is because they have a theology and the Westminster Confession and things like that.

16:38.598 --> 16:42.863
All right, and then you became one of the founders of the Westminster.

16:43.905 --> 16:45.227
Yeah, Presbyterian Church.

16:45.968 --> 16:47.630
And have you all remained active in it?

16:48.491 --> 16:48.811
Oh, yeah.

16:49.352 --> 16:50.794
Yeah, that's our family, really.

16:51.996 --> 16:55.040
I mean, when you get older, it's nice to have all these young people around.

16:55.701 --> 16:58.204
We have about 80 Aggies every Sunday there.

16:58.606 --> 17:06.434
What other activities did you and your wife participate in or attend here?

17:07.736 --> 17:19.568
Well, we liked to go to the concerts, and we didn't have or take time anyway to, we'd give money, but we didn't participate in or organize.

17:19.609 --> 17:22.892
Now, there, the places, of course, contributed a tremendous amount.

17:23.615 --> 17:25.877
When you say concerts, you're meaning Opus.

17:26.357 --> 17:28.860
Opus, yeah, yeah.

17:28.880 --> 17:33.344
Any other special social evening?

17:35.786 --> 17:37.067
Where did y'all vacation?

17:38.428 --> 17:43.453
Well, I promised Madeline we'd get out of Texas every summer.

17:43.473 --> 17:48.157
So, we've been vacationing up in Oregon, on the Oregon coast.

17:48.597 --> 17:51.580
My brother lives in Seattle, and when he was recruiting,

17:52.420 --> 17:56.846
he'd have weekends and he'd go over to the Oregon coast.

17:56.866 --> 17:58.648
And so he knew some good places there.

17:59.369 --> 18:03.074
And so that's, we've been going to the same place for about 12 years now.

18:04.055 --> 18:06.718
Are there any special friends that y'all have made here?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.202
Well, in the church mainly.

18:09.282 --> 18:11.044
As I said, it's kind of like our family.

18:11.805 --> 18:18.934
People that we see every week and, well, we go to a lot of dinners and

18:19.606 --> 18:21.027
things like that with each other.

18:21.188 --> 18:21.448
All right.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.431
Then you ended up living where on a long-term basis?

18:25.332 --> 18:25.872
Living where?

18:26.293 --> 18:26.713
Yeah.

18:26.733 --> 18:26.853
Oh.

18:27.594 --> 18:28.675
Well, we live in Bryan.

18:29.076 --> 18:31.378
What street?

18:31.398 --> 18:31.518
Oh.

18:32.239 --> 18:34.701
Well, it's just off Carter Creek.

18:38.025 --> 18:39.306
Well, it's on Bristol Street.

18:39.366 --> 18:42.789
It's a dead end street, which is nice for children.

18:42.990 --> 18:44.972
And when did y'all move there?

18:44.992 --> 18:46.373
Well, we moved there the

18:47.078 --> 18:51.664
after we'd been here one year and then the rented house we moved there.

18:52.566 --> 19:13.314
And I was invited to give some talks in Russia so I had to prepare for those talks and we were, we thought we had a house but the daughter got married and had to take it over so fortunately Madeline found this house for us on Bristol Street where we moved in and stayed.

19:14.736 --> 19:15.938
Now did

19:16.272 --> 19:21.165
Did a non-Texan have any learning experience here?

19:21.205 --> 19:25.937
Do you remember any, probably humorous?

19:28.043 --> 19:29.607
Well, I remember fixing to.

19:29.958 --> 19:36.185
My secretary kept saying, I'm fixing to, and I said, well, why do you keep saying that?

19:36.205 --> 19:38.147
And she said, well, how would you say it?

19:39.609 --> 19:40.991
That was a good question.

19:42.713 --> 19:45.676
I guess we say I'm going to or something like that.

19:45.696 --> 19:51.763
Well, another thing that strikes me, we go on vacations.

19:51.895 --> 19:56.662
But here you go on leave, and it's like joining the Army, really.

19:57.343 --> 20:05.414
And I notice we have headquarters over here instead of the central office or something like that.

20:05.575 --> 20:07.017
So we notice those things.

20:08.018 --> 20:09.580
So we like Texans very much.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.925
They've been very friendly, and we've enjoyed them.

20:13.580 --> 20:20.229
What are some of the happiest moments you remember as a faculty member, as a scholar here?

20:21.410 --> 20:23.953
Some proudest moments you remember for you?

20:27.958 --> 20:28.599
Oh, I don't know.

20:28.679 --> 20:37.731
I guess publishing papers is the thing I put my thought on, and... Of all your publications, of which one are you most proud?

20:41.828 --> 20:48.916
Well, I think the last one's on this tomograph because it's really original.

20:49.316 --> 20:50.818
It's all that I've done.

20:51.018 --> 20:59.448
Whereas doing another experiment at the cyclotron is, even though it's different than somebody else's experiment, it isn't all that different.

20:59.468 --> 21:04.594
So I feel more, what's the right word about your own children?

21:04.654 --> 21:11.802
The research on the tomograph is closer to my heart than the

21:12.558 --> 21:14.241
Now that's spelled T-O-M-O?

21:14.522 --> 21:14.822
Yeah.

21:15.303 --> 21:18.089
That comes, that's in atom, A-T-O-M.

21:18.409 --> 21:19.652
It means indivisible.

21:20.533 --> 21:23.158
And it means, in this case, it means a slice.

21:23.179 --> 21:28.409
The ring that you put around takes a slice through your body.

21:29.411 --> 21:30.913
Are you still doing some work on that?

21:31.875 --> 21:32.777
Well...

21:33.247 --> 21:37.153
Yeah, just Saturday, the graduate student drove over from Austin.

21:37.273 --> 21:40.278
He's writing up his research, his thesis.

21:41.139 --> 21:43.883
And we went over it, and I made some suggestions.

21:43.903 --> 21:47.389
And he's a very smart guy.

21:47.409 --> 21:48.931
He's very good.

21:49.031 --> 21:52.356
And he's done what's called a Monte Carlo calculation.

21:52.476 --> 21:54.479
I don't know whether you're familiar with those or not.

21:54.560 --> 22:00.148
But essentially, you do a computer calculation of what's happening.

22:00.719 --> 22:04.363
And I always think of doing an experiment to find out what's happening.

22:04.524 --> 22:13.975
But once you've got this computer program, you just plug in the dimensions of the system, and it churns out the answer for you.

22:15.036 --> 22:22.065
So he's been able to compare our results with the commercial results by just using his program.

22:22.325 --> 22:26.651
And it shows our results are very competitive, and we have some other advantages.

22:27.592 --> 22:29.494
So the whole thing's turning out to be

22:31.162 --> 22:32.625
It's ended up very well.

22:32.765 --> 22:36.933
The idea that I had in 1980 turns out to be workable.

22:37.494 --> 22:39.739
But do you still come back to the campus fairly often?

22:40.620 --> 22:41.662
Oh, once a month or so.

22:42.003 --> 22:44.929
It's so hard to, I have to hike.

22:45.610 --> 22:47.053
Well, now it's getting hot even.

22:47.494 --> 22:48.035
The parking?

22:48.415 --> 22:49.317
Yeah, the parking.

22:49.938 --> 22:51.381
But even the old parking,

22:51.800 --> 22:57.325
It was a fairly good hike from the Northgate lot and North lot there.

22:58.386 --> 23:06.554
So I, all my mail comes home now and mainly the junk mail comes to the office.

23:07.595 --> 23:11.339
Let's see, I was asking for high moments.

23:11.379 --> 23:18.786
Do you remember any silly moments in class or when the lab experiment went goofy or anything like that?

23:22.208 --> 23:28.234
I probably suppressed it in my memory.

23:28.254 --> 23:37.603
And I presume no truly sad moments or tragic, never, no one ever injured badly in an accident or in the lab or anything.

23:37.623 --> 23:39.184
Well, I remember one silly moment.

23:39.224 --> 23:40.566
It was when I first got here.

23:41.427 --> 23:48.013
In order to get on the health program, I had to have an examination at the health center.

23:48.905 --> 23:51.669
So I was sitting there waiting, and suddenly there was a great commotion.

23:51.729 --> 23:53.131
Everybody went running down the hall.

23:54.052 --> 23:59.059
And when they asked somebody, I said, what's happened?

23:59.119 --> 24:00.982
They said, well, graduate student's been injured.

24:01.883 --> 24:04.346
And so I said, has he been electrocuted?

24:04.366 --> 24:06.069
No, he got kicked by a cow.

24:08.192 --> 24:10.695
I thought, well, I guess this is where I am.

24:10.755 --> 24:17.224
Did the students ever attempt any jokes or pranks on you?

24:18.537 --> 24:19.680
No, I guess not.

24:20.081 --> 24:24.653
I guess I'm too reserved or something, which I'm just as happy about.

24:24.693 --> 24:26.538
I'd probably get mad if they did.

24:26.558 --> 24:28.784
And no goofy phone calls in the middle of the night.

24:29.145 --> 24:29.426
No.

24:30.790 --> 24:31.632
No.

24:32.634 --> 24:33.998
Let's see.

24:36.239 --> 24:46.139
Politics never got involved to, no one ever said, no, no, no, you don't do research on that kind of thing.

24:47.060 --> 24:47.381
Oh, no.

24:47.622 --> 24:50.066
Nobody ever tried to create any barriers here.

24:51.108 --> 24:52.631
No, it's been very good that way.

24:52.692 --> 24:58.483
I mean, they have a very, and nobody's ever tried to,

24:58.700 --> 25:00.422
you know, steal any money or anything.

25:00.482 --> 25:04.326
As far as I can see, everybody's very careful about handling money.

25:04.886 --> 25:08.670
And I've never seen anybody trying to cut corners.

25:09.491 --> 25:17.519
As you, please try to compare the quality of the students in your first years and in your last years.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.641
How did the A&M student body change?

25:23.746 --> 25:26.108
Well, I think the girls improved.

25:26.476 --> 25:32.985
quality as far as the academic quality goes.

25:35.127 --> 25:41.496
I hired a number of the girls to work on my research because, you know, they're just smart kids that work hard.

25:43.018 --> 25:53.091
And so I'd say that it's the undergraduates, they're the ones I've been involved with, have improved.

25:53.408 --> 25:55.991
Now, this graduate student I have is extremely good, though.

25:56.051 --> 25:58.714
I'd say he's the one I just finished.

25:58.794 --> 26:03.239
It's, you know, comparable to the one who's going to run the space telescope someday.

26:04.501 --> 26:08.526
And... Now, are there many young ladies that major in physics?

26:09.707 --> 26:17.236
Is physics... Yeah, in fact, the wife of this graduate student was a major in physics, graduated here in physics a couple years ago.

26:17.496 --> 26:20.800
So physics isn't seen as a male-only discipline.

26:23.227 --> 26:24.669
Well, I think it is kind of.

26:24.689 --> 26:27.352
We don't have many, many men.

26:27.412 --> 26:36.261
And I don't think it's the culture myself, because a lot of women go into medicine.

26:37.002 --> 26:46.453
And I think the culture there is, with the nurses and everything, is much more hierarchical with the men in charge than in physics.

26:47.834 --> 26:49.056
It's a puzzle to me.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.980
I mean, here the women will take frogs apart and

26:53.450 --> 27:00.000
put their elbows up in gore, and then in physics you have a nice clean screwdriver and hook wires together.

27:00.020 --> 27:05.067
I think it's the problem solving part of it.

27:05.768 --> 27:09.574
And I was trying to think of the word before, math anxiety.

27:10.655 --> 27:18.647
I guess it's just that analytical thinking that, and also the boys,

27:19.623 --> 27:21.185
have a feel for how things go.

27:21.245 --> 27:27.034
They know when a car goes around a corner you tend to swing off to the side.

27:27.975 --> 27:37.830
I think it's a bunch of things, but I've seen very little anti-woman examples in physics.

27:38.871 --> 27:45.681
And we hired one lady from Berkeley to be on the faculty

27:46.657 --> 27:52.569
and she just didn't match up with the men we had, so we let her go.

27:53.471 --> 27:54.393
Well, she sued us.

27:55.235 --> 28:05.256
I mean, the poor department had had us take his whole Christmas vacation going back over all the people we had promoted, and I mean,

28:06.063 --> 28:08.506
It almost makes you wonder if you should hire a woman.

28:08.946 --> 28:12.510
I guess it's the same problem with the blacks, because you can't get rid of them.

28:12.530 --> 28:16.274
Did she allege discrimination?

28:16.294 --> 28:16.634
Yeah.

28:17.896 --> 28:18.456
Did she win?

28:18.797 --> 28:20.238
No.

28:20.258 --> 28:27.206
Well, he dug up enough, I don't know, it's very hard, as you know, for promotions to be objective.

28:27.906 --> 28:34.213
You just know somebody's a good physicist, that's all, and you can't write it down.

28:34.936 --> 28:50.819
How would you evaluate, in general, A&M's quality in relating the students and so forth, in relating to different cultures?

28:52.301 --> 28:56.387
Like, I have the opinion that there were no problems here with racial integration.

28:57.059 --> 28:59.683
that it wasn't easy for some of the first women.

29:00.624 --> 29:08.416
But did you see, in your classes, did you see good interaction of people in terms of class?

29:09.458 --> 29:16.048
Yeah, for a while in the 80s, the women went up to maybe one-third of the class.

29:16.148 --> 29:17.550
I doubt if they're that high now.

29:18.692 --> 29:23.840
And they got some of the top grades, too.

29:23.860 --> 29:26.003
As I said, they made the men work hard.

29:26.523 --> 29:29.707
So, no, as far as I could tell, there was never a problem.

29:30.107 --> 29:36.415
I can tell you a story about Rudder and the racial integration.

29:36.715 --> 29:38.557
Andy Suttle told me this.

29:39.258 --> 29:46.186
He said Rudder brought in the commander of the Corps of Cadets and said, look, we're going to have a black in there.

29:46.987 --> 29:50.131
If anything happens to him, your career in the Army is finished.

29:51.172 --> 29:52.634
That's how the Army works, I guess.

29:52.734 --> 29:56.158
So I'm sure he pushed it on down the line.

29:56.493 --> 29:58.795
And that's how it got, and they were never in any trouble.

30:01.918 --> 30:09.526
Let's see, evaluation of, and I'm not going to ask negative, evaluation of deans.

30:10.047 --> 30:14.191
To which deans of science would you give the highest marks during your years?

30:16.854 --> 30:22.139
Well, I didn't like Prescott very well because he didn't like PLOS, I guess.

30:22.159 --> 30:26.263
He, I forgot who he replaced PLOS with.

30:26.716 --> 30:29.439
Maybe Adair was an assistant.

30:29.459 --> 30:32.002
Anyhow, he said he knows where every paperclip is.

30:32.242 --> 30:33.103
That was Prescott.

30:33.884 --> 30:37.187
Now, to me, a good department head does not know where every paperclip is.

30:37.207 --> 30:39.670
He's worrying about what research is going on.

30:40.731 --> 30:52.944
And so that was just an example of Prescott was just in the wrong neighborhood when it came to understand academic people.

30:54.025 --> 30:56.368
But you give high marks to whom?

30:57.108 --> 31:02.181
Well, I liked Zener, although he was kind of a, I guess, I don't know.

31:02.743 --> 31:05.731
He was a nice man, and I don't know whether he was a good dean, though.

31:05.791 --> 31:08.839
He made this terrible mistake with Squire.

31:09.190 --> 31:16.499
And he probably should have stayed as a professor and not got into management.

31:16.519 --> 31:24.288
Well, you know, as well as I do, better than I do, I'm sure, that it isn't easy to go into management from being a professor.

31:24.488 --> 31:27.712
And probably most people don't do it very well.

31:29.174 --> 31:32.898
And... All right, what about the chief academic officers?

31:33.459 --> 31:36.322
Now we call it provosts, used to be vice president of academic officers.

31:36.482 --> 31:38.725
Yeah, well, those people are so far away from me.

31:38.890 --> 31:40.109
But Wayne Hall or what?
