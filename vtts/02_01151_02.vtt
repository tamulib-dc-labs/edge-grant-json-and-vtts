00:01.516 --> 00:06.020
The safety center you see on the door here is kind of 
an interesting thing. I got involved in the

00:07.762 --> 00:13.647
chemical process safety area, I guess, about four 
years ago. A fellow who is now retired used to be

00:13.667 --> 00:21.935
head of the safety engineering program in 
industrial engineering, Ralph Vernon. I don't

00:21.955 --> 00:22.596
know if you knew that. I think I do. That's been a 
really good program, hasn't it? Well, it's kind of

00:26.239 --> 00:29.262
ironic because it wasn't. an independent degree 
program. And then they kind of downgraded it just

00:31.906 --> 00:35.812
to an option in the IE program. And then they 
transferred it to nuclear engineering because

00:36.393 --> 00:42.323
they had a radiological safety program there. So 
they combined it with that. So it's been kind of

00:44.166 --> 00:47.672
disbursed over the recent years. They still have 
some IE people teaching some undergraduate

00:47.990 --> 00:55.859
courses, but the graduate program is centered in 
nuclear engineering. But there's been a market

00:55.879 --> 00:57.982
for those kind of people, hasn't there? There has 
been a demand. And Ralph, back in about four years

00:59.584 --> 01:16.444
ago, had, and I don't know how he got it, but he got a 
contract with Pertamina Oil Company in Indonesia

00:59.584 --> 01:16.444
for teaching a safety program to 24 Indonesian 
engineers. This is a 10-week program in the

01:16.745 --> 01:19.149
summertime. And he was looking for help. And I'd 
known Ralph for a while. We always talked

01:23.255 --> 01:25.078
informally and stuff. So he told me about it. And 
about that time, there was a book, a new book that

01:27.381 --> 01:30.386
came out. The chemical engineering program was 
emphasizing process safety. And the AICHE was

01:34.832 --> 01:36.936
pushing this. They have a center for chemical 
process safety and all of that. And there was a book

01:40.060 --> 01:42.184
that came out on that subject. And I was interested 
in the book. So I volunteered. to teach chemical

01:45.500 --> 01:49.485
process safety to these Indonesian engineers. So 
I helped Ralph teach these guys. And I set up some

01:52.028 --> 01:55.072
field trips for them to different companies 
around. And I went through that whole book. And I

01:58.015 --> 02:04.824
saw that this was a really significant, important 
topic in the profession and in the industry. So I

02:04.844 --> 02:08.909
put it in as an elective course. It took me about two 
or three years to get it in, because at the time,

02:08.929 --> 02:14.916
Blumefeld was head of the department. And we were 
kind of in a bind to meet our required teaching

02:15.284 --> 02:21.029
loads with our required courses. So he wasn't 
inclined to add another elective course. So he

02:25.013 --> 02:29.777
first told me that I couldn't teach it unless I 
thought it was an overload. But I volunteered to

02:29.797 --> 02:31.999
teach it as an overload. That's a nice offer, isn't 
it? Yeah. But you did. You did do it. I did. I taught

02:35.061 --> 02:37.003
it as an overload the first time. And it went over 
pretty well. So we put it in as a permanent course.

02:42.868 --> 02:44.970
And then about a year later, I got this letter in the 
mail from a lawyer in Houston who said he had a

02:45.271 --> 03:00.109
client who he couldn't name, but he was interested 
in supporting an educational program across the

02:45.271 --> 03:00.109
state, wanted to know what we had going. So I wrote 
him. I responded. I told him what I was doing in the

03:02.712 --> 03:07.578
course and something about the safety program 
here and all of that. And I didn't get a response, so

03:08.339 --> 03:10.822
I forgot about it. And about a year later, Then I got 
another letter saying that Mr. T. Michael

03:13.975 --> 03:23.908
O'Connor would like to set up his endowed program 
here at A&M. And T. Michael O'Connor is not the one

03:25.510 --> 03:29.376
who's on the Board of Regents. We have a T. Michael 
O'Connor on the Regents, but this is another

03:29.396 --> 03:37.106
fellow who was a chemical engineering graduate 
from the University of Missouri at Rolla. And his

03:38.027 --> 03:43.054
wife is also a chemical engineering graduate from 
the University of Missouri at Columbia. And he was

03:43.726 --> 03:46.810
working for Kellogg at the time. And his wife was 
working for Phillips. And she was killed in the

03:50.074 --> 03:55.000
Phillips explosion in Pasadena in 1989. And there 
was 23 people killed in that explosion. And most of

03:59.786 --> 04:04.391
them participated in the class action lawsuit 
against Phillips. But Mike O'Connor didn't.

04:05.993 --> 04:13.362
Being a chem engineer, he did extra homework to 
find out what went wrong and what they couldn't do

04:05.993 --> 04:13.362
right and all of that. and he filed his own 
independent lawsuit. That's why the lawyer

04:16.230 --> 04:21.376
couldn't tell me who it was in the beginning, 
because the lawsuit was still pending. Well, it

04:21.396 --> 04:35.873
ended up that he got a $40 million settlement from 
that lawsuit, and he dedicated $4 million of that

04:21.396 --> 04:35.873
to education and process safety, which he put 
aside in a private foundation. And the proceeds

04:36.342 --> 04:39.726
are now coming to us here. The money that's 
generated by the interest from that endowment is

04:39.746 --> 04:48.195
coming here to support the program. But this is 
good and bad. It's obviously good to have this

04:49.796 --> 04:52.900
resource. The bad part about it is that process 
safety is not a traditional research area for

04:52.920 --> 04:59.987
chemical engineering. It's much more applied. 
It's industrial oriented. In fact, I just served

05:04.217 --> 05:13.331
as the chairman for a plant process safety 
symposium sponsored by AICH in Houston on the 1st

05:04.217 --> 05:13.331
of April. We had over 500 attendees, 30 technical 
sessions, a bunch of exhibitors. I think I was the

05:18.900 --> 05:22.725
only academic involved in the whole meeting. The 
rest of them were industrial people from all over

05:22.745 --> 05:27.072
the world, but they were all industrial people. 
I'm sure with environmental law and safety law,

05:27.288 --> 05:32.813
they're in liability and all that stuff. It's a 
very hot area in the industry, but there's no

05:32.913 --> 05:39.219
programs in NSF to support it. So it's not easy 
getting funding support from traditional

05:39.740 --> 05:46.146
research support areas. But we recently have 
gotten a grant from the Design Institute for

05:46.987 --> 05:56.856
Emergency Relief Systems, which is an informal 
industrial group sponsored by the AICHE that's

05:57.190 --> 06:07.039
dedicated to developing design procedures for 
emergency relief pressure vessels. And a lot of

06:07.059 --> 06:15.747
these pressure vessels are chemical reactors 
that, when the reaction takes off and runs away,

06:07.059 --> 06:15.747
then stuff comes out to the leak lane. And you have 
to be able to design these things to properly size

06:15.767 --> 06:26.016
them to handle the flow rates so the pressure 
doesn't run beyond the second level. Nobody knows

06:26.435 --> 06:37.392
how to do this properly because, you know, this is 
an unsteady state, multi-phase,

06:26.435 --> 06:37.392
non-isothermal, you know, a very complicated 
system that these things take on. And so the design

06:37.412 --> 06:47.208
institute had actually put together a design 
manual and a computer program for doing this, and

06:37.412 --> 06:47.208
they made some money from that. And so they put out 
some RFPs, request for proposals for research,

06:53.435 --> 06:58.361
for high-viscosity, multi-phase flows through 
the leaf systems. So meanwhile, I had, with some of

06:58.381 --> 07:15.904
the contacts I made through this symposium, 
another fellow who was president of the South

06:58.381 --> 07:15.904
Texas AICHE interested in this area, who's 
actually also chairman of the Chemical

06:58.381 --> 07:15.904
Engineering Advisory Committee for Prairie 
View, as a matter of fact. They've been trying to

07:15.924 --> 07:20.269
push Prairie View to get involved in research in 
this area. And then I came on the same, and it was

07:20.289 --> 07:23.053
obvious I had direct interest in this area so i 
teamed up with them and five or six companies and we

07:23.405 --> 07:47.742
competed for this grant from this naira institute 
apparently they've

07:23.405 --> 07:47.742
been there as long as i've been here yeah it's had a 
very spotty history up and down a lot of changes in

07:23.405 --> 07:47.742
personnel and administration It's not been too 
stable over the years, but it's been there. And I

07:51.650 --> 07:56.320
think it's getting better, but it still has a ways 
to go. They don't have much of a graduate program.

08:00.870 --> 08:01.852
They do have some master's students. So myself and 
a fellow in mechanical engineering, a fellow

08:01.872 --> 08:07.384
who's head in Prairie View, two companies that 
have test facilities that make these relief

08:07.735 --> 08:24.220
valves and testing and evaluating are in a 
consortium group that we did on this contract, and

08:07.735 --> 08:24.220
we got it. And so we're now getting started to that. 
And Dr. Patrick has been officially signed with

08:25.562 --> 08:27.766
NASA. The only project I have to complain about is 
the Hilton Johnson Space Center. And NASA has a...

08:32.980 --> 08:41.334
term, and it's not human engineering, but anyway, 
it has to do with safety and adaptation of systems

08:32.980 --> 08:41.334
first. The human... They call it ergonomics. Part 
of that, like a chair, an ergonomic chair. They're

08:47.865 --> 08:50.350
really conscious of that. Because, of course, in 
that, safety... preservation and duplicate

08:53.551 --> 08:59.517
systems and self-redundant systems and what have 
you. One of the problems I have when I say process

08:59.597 --> 09:10.368
safety, we have the safety engineering program 
here at A&M already, which really is basically

08:59.597 --> 09:10.368
industrial hygiene things. Industrial hygiene 
is more personnel safety, protection from

09:10.388 --> 09:21.499
hazardous environment and that sort of thing, 
whereas process safety is how to make the plants

09:10.388 --> 09:21.499
and processes and equipment safe. So there's a lot 
more engineering design involved, like sizing

09:21.715 --> 09:27.082
these relief valves. And the government 
guidelines now require, OSHA and EPA guidelines

09:27.663 --> 09:41.462
require all companies that handle certain 
amounts of any hazardous material to have not only

09:27.663 --> 09:41.462
training programs, but they have to estimate what 
happens, scenarios, if pipes would break or

09:41.729 --> 10:08.834
vessels would rupture, how much of this stuff 
would be released, at what rate, where it would go,

09:41.729 --> 10:08.834
what would be the concentrations and the 
consequences and the effects, so vapor cloud

09:41.729 --> 10:08.834
dispersion modeling, release rates, relief 
systems, all of that, and how to design processes

09:41.729 --> 10:08.834
that are inherently safer using less severe 
conditions, less negative materials and things

09:41.729 --> 10:08.834
like that. This is all process safety. In fact, 
AICHE has the Center for Chemical Process Safety,

10:11.024 --> 10:25.882
which in turn has a national committee whose 
objective is to integrate process safety topics

10:11.024 --> 10:25.882
into the chemical engineering curriculum. And 
I'm a member of that committee. And all of us are

10:28.025 --> 10:39.259
developing teaching modules that incorporate 
various process safety topics in process control

10:28.025 --> 10:39.259
and committees and fluid mechanics and 
stoichiometry and all those. It looks like all

10:39.492 --> 10:50.004
those blue books on the shelf behind you

10:39.492 --> 10:50.004
are examples of these teaching modules that we've 
developed. Would you say most of your students

10:50.084 --> 10:54.509
that you've been here go into refining, 
protein-related industries? Well,

10:54.529 --> 11:00.836
historically, the petrochemical industry has 
been the main employee of the chemical engineers.

11:00.856 --> 11:02.278
But that's gradually shifting. In fact, in the 
early 80s, we had a downturn in employment

11:08.585 --> 11:09.906
petrochemical industry. At that time, a lot of 
them were taken up by companies like pulp and paper

11:10.327 --> 11:19.777
companies or foods and pharmaceuticals and that. 
In recent times, a very hot area has been

11:19.797 --> 11:31.989
electronic processing, making solid state 
wafers, silicon wafers, and IC circuits. There's

11:32.009 --> 11:34.812
a lot of chemical processes not only involved with 
making the wafers, but actually making the

11:35.011 --> 11:42.502
circuits by etching and diffusion and things like 
that, which are chemical processes. So those

11:42.522 --> 11:51.696
companies finally realized that chemical 
engineers know a lot and can benefit from it. Good.

11:52.097 --> 11:53.519
That's good. Well, Ron, I don't want to keep you any 
longer today, since we've done a lot. But I'd like

11:57.565 --> 12:02.652
to come back at you, possibly, sometime. I'm going 
to take my time doing this. Could I get from you, you

12:04.998 --> 12:12.474
have to have a copy of your vita sometimes. Do you 
have any information on the safety processing

12:12.494 --> 12:18.406
brochure or something? Let me see you all. Thank 
you very much.
