WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:14.453
And I don't think that, I really don't think there should be any classes that size.

00:14.473 --> 00:21.400
I could see it maybe having a very distinguished lecture and then having a whole bunch of teaching assistants take them into separate sections, but that's not the way it happens there.

00:22.342 --> 00:25.465
They're in a class of 500 and then they have stanton tests.

00:27.757 --> 00:35.308
More money needs to go into faculty and less into building.

00:35.468 --> 00:38.713
We spend all our money on building.

00:38.733 --> 00:48.668
I was very glad to see a couple of years ago, was it last year, that somebody decided simply that the money would do with the faculty would not go anywhere else.

00:53.626 --> 01:12.196
I want to see more if it's a place on teaching as something to be evaluated in children and families in case it falls off the board.

01:12.216 --> 01:20.730
I want to see fewer committees and less committee work because I think the people now in the community are so involved in committee work that we don't have time to teach.

01:24.929 --> 01:34.880
I'd like to see sabbatical given more regularly and without competition.

01:34.980 --> 01:43.369
Because I think it should be the case that somebody was doing a good job for X number of years deserves a sabbatical.

01:43.389 --> 01:45.311
Things that would affect the whole institution.

01:49.516 --> 01:50.737
How about the enrollment?

01:50.757 --> 01:53.681
Yeah, I was just going to raise that issue.

01:54.081 --> 01:54.902
An admission report.

01:56.671 --> 01:59.877
I think that they should cap the enrollment.

01:59.897 --> 02:02.882
They already have that, haven't they?

02:02.902 --> 02:04.345
I think they have.

02:04.365 --> 02:06.208
Let's say they have.

02:08.332 --> 02:12.259
Raise the admission requirements.

02:12.279 --> 02:18.831
And encourage rather than discourage out-of-state.

02:19.013 --> 02:26.885
We're not going to have thousands and thousands of people walking in if we do that.

02:26.905 --> 02:35.738
We make it a little more open to people from Pennsylvania, California.

02:35.918 --> 02:39.503
I think too that we should work with junior college systems.

02:45.541 --> 02:46.883
And we are doing some of that.

02:46.903 --> 02:54.092
I know that we work with Glenn to alleviate the pressure on pressure.

02:54.112 --> 02:54.793
And this is good.

02:54.813 --> 03:00.981
What is your finding so far about the quality of the instruction that Glenn is giving?

03:07.069 --> 03:10.133
Well, on the basic level, it's pretty much the same.

03:10.153 --> 03:11.975
And they're all our graduate students who are teaching here who are also teaching there.

03:11.995 --> 03:14.198
Who then, in some cases, graduate

03:14.819 --> 03:20.045
their masters and go teach there full-time, often because they're married to somebody here.

03:20.105 --> 03:23.369
I don't think there's any problem with that.

03:24.090 --> 03:26.092
They have worse students.

03:26.133 --> 03:27.835
They've got some awful students over there.

03:28.575 --> 03:34.503
And sometimes the awful students will get through the courses just because anybody who does all the work over there is going to get through.

03:34.523 --> 03:38.607
Nobody's going to fail except people who disappear at midterm.

03:40.229 --> 03:43.273
So we do get some people from Blinn that have high grades that aren't very

03:46.426 --> 03:49.673
But I don't think that they're getting bad courses over there.

03:49.713 --> 03:50.875
I think they're getting good courses.

03:50.975 --> 03:55.565
And, in fact, I think they're getting essentially our courses.

03:58.050 --> 03:58.691
How do you feel?

03:58.751 --> 04:01.397
What is your thought about A&M's future?

04:01.918 --> 04:04.603
Is it optimistic, pessimistic, or...

04:05.039 --> 04:13.509
Well, it's optimistic, but I do think that we have to cap enrollment if we haven't already done it and really should reduce it some.

04:13.589 --> 04:17.293
It should go down to, oh, I'd say no more than 35.

04:17.574 --> 04:26.664
I don't know how to do this.

04:26.845 --> 04:32.231
This is not, but it would seem to be possible to do it.

04:32.251 --> 04:34.093
What about Region 2020?

04:34.113 --> 04:34.894
What do you think is that?

04:35.650 --> 04:42.762
I think a lot of it is meanness.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.728
I read a lot of that document, and I thought, God.

04:46.909 --> 04:51.917
Some of it is very good, but a lot of it is very vague, too.

04:51.937 --> 04:58.047
I mean, we really need to have more constructors on all levels.

04:59.495 --> 05:04.960
And we need to have, to be competitive with you too, we need to have a lot more structures.

05:04.980 --> 05:12.307
And that's in the report, but it's not specific enough.

05:12.327 --> 05:17.932
I'm using the word instructor, meaning anyone who teaches.

05:18.353 --> 05:23.758
But I don't think that we can do it with, for a while we had many, many lectures.

05:23.778 --> 05:26.380
I don't think this is a good idea, because people who are really good,

05:27.119 --> 05:33.886
We have a couple of lifetime lectures who are excellent.

05:34.867 --> 05:41.814
But we've had many, many people pass through here, some of whom were terrible.

05:42.615 --> 05:44.557
So I think we need more tenure-track people.

05:46.019 --> 05:54.207
And those lectures we do have, we need to treat well, and we need to make them senior lecturers so that somebody, for instance, like Dorothy Van Ryber, have you spoken with her?

05:55.013 --> 05:56.896
No, no, I've done Paul.

05:56.916 --> 05:57.377
I haven't done Dorothy.

05:57.397 --> 05:58.539
Yeah, okay.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.861
Well, she's a lifetime lecturer.

06:00.962 --> 06:03.366
And she will tell you what this does.

06:07.032 --> 06:11.379
Because she's teaching essential classes.

06:13.782 --> 06:23.097
And yet I think that there's a kind of bitterness on the part of lifetime lectures because they're not, and she is a senior lecturer, but we need to have better conditions for our lecturers.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.282
All right.

06:27.523 --> 06:36.896
Any female-related experiences, plus and minus, that you want to share that we haven't already done throughout all the years?

06:36.956 --> 06:37.897
Female-related?

06:39.079 --> 06:39.620
Yeah.

06:39.880 --> 06:40.060
Okay.

06:40.321 --> 06:44.346
Being a woman faculty member, the pluses or the minuses here?

06:48.692 --> 06:54.079
Well, I can think of lots of little slights from the old days, but nothing major.

06:57.063 --> 07:01.489
What about a positive where you go, okay, the thing has turned.

07:01.930 --> 07:04.914
The tide is going the positive way.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.179
Being a female, I don't know.

07:08.760 --> 07:14.108
I do remember that when I was having children, my students did not approve of this.

07:15.129 --> 07:22.940
And one of them said to me, this is a negative experience, a core person said to me, I wouldn't let my wife be pregnant and teach.

07:23.541 --> 07:26.125
Here I was about eight months pregnant and I was teaching.

07:26.577 --> 07:30.306
And I don't remember what I said to him.

07:30.346 --> 07:35.720
I remember I looked at him in astonishment, but I don't remember, I don't think I had any snappy come back.

07:35.860 --> 07:44.181
I think I just said, well, that's lovely for you, and went on to something else.

07:46.507 --> 07:52.695
I encountered that quite a bit and it was kind of funny because there were a bunch of pregnant teachers in the English department at once.

07:53.256 --> 08:03.108
Pat Harris was in the department then and she was pregnant and there was a woman named Judy Finn who hasn't been around for years and years and she was there and we kind of took up the whole faculty room.

08:03.889 --> 08:10.878
But there was a certain amount of you shouldn't be here at that point that was not accepted.

08:12.941 --> 08:15.484
I can't think of any really awful

08:16.274 --> 08:32.401
I never encountered, nor can I think of anything astoundingly wonderful that happened to me here because I was a woman.

08:35.206 --> 08:38.451
I've just always been here and I've always taught.

08:38.971 --> 08:44.444
I've become aware of the improvement of attitudes towards women.

08:45.206 --> 08:48.614
And as the years go by, there are more and more women.

08:49.536 --> 08:51.501
There's less and less discrimination against them.

08:51.942 --> 08:53.706
But there are still some Aggies who

08:56.420 --> 09:08.994
If we could get all of the people from your A&M experience into one place, to which ones and for what would you most want to express your appreciation?

09:09.474 --> 09:11.436
Okay, Stanley Archer.

09:11.456 --> 09:11.917
Because?

09:12.237 --> 09:14.300
Because he guided me all these years.

09:14.420 --> 09:25.752
He was one of the first people to recognize me as a faculty member as opposed to another one of the teaching assistants.

09:26.693 --> 09:32.439
Frank Pierce, because actually Frank was very protective during those years.

09:32.859 --> 09:39.846
And he was one of the people that, for instance, back then you didn't have any choice about where and when you talk ordinarily.

09:40.867 --> 09:44.331
And they could just as soon send you a mile away.

09:44.411 --> 09:53.460
But Frank Pierce was always, like when I was having children and so forth, he always made sure my classes were relatively local and that they were at good hours.

09:53.862 --> 10:00.217
And he also, he was the first person to say, we all, I called all these people, doctor this and that.

10:00.898 --> 10:03.204
And Frank was the first person to say, call me Frank.

10:03.825 --> 10:04.888
And I appreciated that.

10:10.661 --> 10:12.225
Okay, Stanley Frank.

10:13.505 --> 10:16.329
Bedford Clark, but just he's my long-term friend here.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.693
I was here when they hired him.

10:18.753 --> 10:19.754
I think he was a great hire.

10:19.814 --> 10:22.519
He's always been around for good advice.

10:24.301 --> 10:24.722
Who else?

10:33.796 --> 10:35.358
Don't have to be in the department now.

10:35.398 --> 10:35.718
Anyone?

10:35.738 --> 10:36.900
Oh, they don't have to be in the department.

10:37.020 --> 10:38.803
Anyone associated with A&M that you...

10:39.728 --> 10:43.493
Okay, Maxine Davenport, Manuel's first wife, and Manuel himself.

10:48.260 --> 10:54.989
Sylvia Grider, who also came in a long time ago and who has not been treated well by the system.

10:55.009 --> 11:05.483
His name comes to mind always when I think it's people not being treated well.

11:11.116 --> 11:15.022
An odd name that you may not even remember.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.063
Do you remember Parks Hunter?

11:17.706 --> 11:23.174
Well, he caused everybody much food, but he was very kind to me and very helpful.

11:23.194 --> 11:27.119
And he made all kinds of dreadful mistakes with other people.

11:27.159 --> 11:36.553
And he was best known for dragging in people to see the apartment had he let their class go by themselves.

11:36.573 --> 11:38.676
He just did not win any friends at all.

11:39.449 --> 11:43.215
I was careful not to do that when my class was anywhere in vicinity of parks.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.296
But he was very good to me.

11:44.597 --> 11:46.059
And so I would remember him.

11:46.259 --> 11:48.002
I would go to him for advice.

11:52.108 --> 11:54.732
You know, when I'm thinking, except for Sylvia, these are all men.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.036
Catherine O'Keefe is not here anymore.

11:58.498 --> 11:59.380
She's in Notre Dame.

12:02.464 --> 12:07.532
And I think that's about the list of people I would go to for advice.

12:08.795 --> 12:14.198
Well, let's finish the questions and then we'll think.

12:33.753 --> 12:38.681
I would want it for the establishment of an MFA program.

12:38.701 --> 12:40.885
A million dollars wouldn't go far in that direction.

12:40.905 --> 12:53.145
If I couldn't do that, then I wouldn't have speaker series, another instructor, whatever, in the area of doing writing.

13:08.903 --> 13:14.254
since 1958.

13:14.355 --> 13:15.778
I've been teaching here since 1969.

13:15.798 --> 13:19.385
I taught elsewhere before and for one year during this time period.

13:19.406 --> 13:20.688
But other than that, I know nothing.

13:20.708 --> 13:23.554
I don't know how other institutions work.

13:23.755 --> 13:29.106
And I certainly enjoyed teaching.

13:29.126 --> 13:29.427
And I was

13:34.756 --> 13:40.422
but other people from that time period.

13:41.883 --> 13:47.529
And now I'm beginning to see, I've had the children of my first student.

13:47.549 --> 13:51.192
I figure when the grandchildren show up, it's probably time to retire.

13:52.694 --> 14:00.542
And so I would say in many ways I do identify with Texas a lot.

14:02.964 --> 14:03.885
But I'm not a traditional student.

14:04.912 --> 14:19.022
I'm just trying to think of things
