WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:13.729
And I

00:03.254 --> 00:13.729
really don't think there should be any classes 
that size. I could see it maybe having a very

00:13.749 --> 00:21.419
distinguished lecture and then having a whole 
bunch of teaching assistants take them into

00:13.749 --> 00:21.419
separate sections, but that's not the way it 
happens there. They're in a class of 500, and then

00:22.381 --> 00:25.425
they have stand-time tests. And I

00:27.187 --> 00:32.014
don't think this is fair. More money needs to go 
into faculty. and less in the building. I think we

00:36.277 --> 00:38.619
spend all our money on the building. And I was very 
glad to see a couple of years ago, if it wasn't last

00:38.639 --> 01:00.664
year, that somebody

00:38.639 --> 01:00.664
decided simply that the money was here with the 
faculty. It would not go anywhere else. I want to

01:01.305 --> 01:02.927
see more emphasis placed on teaching as something 
to be evaluated and .

01:06.164 --> 01:26.154
I want to see fewer committees and less committee 
work because I think the people now in the

01:06.164 --> 01:26.154
community club and anywhere that's so involved in

01:06.164 --> 01:26.154
committee

01:06.164 --> 01:26.154
work, they don't have time to do that. I'd like to 
see sabbaticals. given more regularly and

01:28.456 --> 01:35.868
without

01:28.456 --> 01:35.868
complications. And that doesn't seem to face that 
somebody who's done a good job for X number of years

01:35.888 --> 01:43.220
deserves it for that. Things that would affect the 
whole institution.

01:49.550 --> 01:50.832
How about the enrollment? Yeah, I was just going to 
raise that issue. And admission. I think that they

01:56.688 --> 01:59.893
should cap the enrollment. They already have 
that, don't they? I think they have. They say they

02:04.700 --> 02:05.221
have.

02:08.345 --> 02:12.271
Raise the admission requirements. And

02:12.291 --> 02:20.383
encourage or discourage out-of-state 
enrollment with the students. We're not going to

02:20.498 --> 02:39.112
have dozens, well

02:20.498 --> 02:39.112
dozens of course, we're not going to have 
thousands and thousands of people walking in if we

02:20.498 --> 02:39.112
do that. We make it a little more open to people from 
Pennsylvania and California. I think too that we

02:40.614 --> 02:42.658
should work with junior college systems to 
alleviate some of the

02:46.250 --> 02:46.891
some of that. I know that we work with Glenn to 
alleviate the pressure on freshman English and

02:46.911 --> 02:54.822
technical writing. What is your finding so far 
about the quality of instruction Glenn is giving?

03:06.858 --> 03:10.483
Well, on the basic level, it's pretty much the 
same. They're all our graduate students who are

03:10.503 --> 03:12.205
teaching here who are also teaching there. Who 
then, in some cases, graduated their masters and

03:14.836 --> 03:20.122
go teach there full-time, often because they're 
married to somebody here. I don't think there's

03:20.142 --> 03:23.386
any problem with that. They have worse students. 
They've got some awful students over there. And

03:28.592 --> 03:34.540
sometimes the awful students will get through the 
courses just because anybody who does all the work

03:28.592 --> 03:34.540
over there is going to get through. Nobody's going 
to fail except people who disappear at midterm. So

03:40.246 --> 03:43.290
we do get some people from Blinn that have high 
grades that aren't very

03:46.460 --> 03:49.684
But I don't think that they're getting bad courses 
over there. I think they're getting good courses.

03:51.006 --> 03:53.149
And, in fact, I think they're getting essentially 
our courses.

03:58.055 --> 03:58.696
How do you feel? What is your thought about it in the 
future? Is it optimistic, pessimistic? Well,

04:06.426 --> 04:09.430
it's optimistic. But I do think that we have to cap 
enrollment if we haven't already done it and

04:09.450 --> 04:12.214
really should reduce it somewhat. It should go 
down to, oh, I'd say no more than 35.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.814
I don't know how to do this. This is not, but it would 
seem to be possible to do it.

04:35.843 --> 04:42.150
I think a lot of it is,

04:35.843 --> 04:42.150
a lot of it is meaningless. I read a lot of that 
document, and I thought that some of it is very

04:42.434 --> 04:51.876
good, but a lot of it is very vague, too. I mean, we 
really need to have more instructors on all

04:51.896 --> 04:58.030
levels. And we need to have, to be competitive with 
you too, we need to have a

04:59.512 --> 05:11.247
lot more instructors. And that's in the report, 
but it's not specific enough. I'm using the word

05:12.388 --> 05:17.975
instructor meaning anyone who could. But I don't 
think that we can do it with, for a while we had many,

05:18.376 --> 05:23.963
many lectures. I don't think this is a good idea 
because people who are really good, instructors

05:27.153 --> 05:32.100
don't generally want to do lifetime lectures. And 
we have a couple of lifetime lectures who are

05:32.120 --> 05:33.922
excellent. But we've had many, many people pass 
through here, some of whom were terrible.

05:42.655 --> 05:44.597
So I think we need more tenure track people. And 
those lectures we do have, we need to treat well.

05:48.563 --> 05:53.330
And we need to make them senior lecturers so that 
somebody, for instance, like Dorothy Van Ryber.

05:53.350 --> 05:54.291
Have you spoken with her? No, I've done Paul. I 
haven't done Doris. Yeah, okay. Well, she's a

05:58.598 --> 05:59.880
lifetime lecturer. And she will tell you what this 
does.

06:07.050 --> 06:11.396
Because she's teaching essential classes. And 
yet I think that there's a kind of bitterness on the

06:13.800 --> 06:23.113
part of lifetime lecturers because they're not, 
and she is a senior lecturer, but we need to have

06:13.800 --> 06:23.113
better conditions for our lecturers. All right. 
Any female-related experiences, plus and minus,

06:27.553 --> 06:36.062
that you want to share that we haven't already done 
throughout all the years? Female-related? Yeah.

06:39.805 --> 06:40.306
Okay. Being a woman faculty member, the pluses or 
the minuses here?

06:48.714 --> 06:54.079
Well, I can think of lots of little slights from the 
old days, but nothing major.

06:57.113 --> 07:01.519
What about a positive where you say, okay, the 
thing has turned. The tide is going the positive

07:01.959 --> 07:04.943
way. Being a female, I don't know. I do remember 
that when I was having children, my students did

07:08.788 --> 07:14.155
not approve of this. And one of them said to me, this 
is a negative experience, a core person said to me,

07:15.137 --> 07:22.967
I wouldn't let my wife be pregnant and teach. Here I 
was about eight months pregnant and I was teaching

07:23.568 --> 07:26.091
her. And I don't remember what I said to him. I 
remember I looked at him in astonishment, but I

07:30.377 --> 07:35.705
don't remember, I don't think I had any snappy 
comeback. I think I just said, well, that's lovely

07:35.885 --> 07:44.198
for you, and went on to something else.

07:46.540 --> 08:15.450
I encountered that quite a bit and it was kind of 
funny because there were a bunch of pregnant

07:46.540 --> 08:15.450
teachers in the English department at once Pat 
Harris was in the department then and she was

07:46.540 --> 08:15.450
pregnant and there was a woman named Judy Finn who 
hasn't been around for years and years and she was

07:46.540 --> 08:15.450
there and we kind of took up the whole faculty room 
but there was a certain amount of you shouldn't be

07:46.540 --> 08:15.450
here at that point that was not accepted I can't 
think of any really awful I never encountered and

08:16.308 --> 08:32.445
nor can I think of anything astoundingly 
wonderful that happened to me here because I was a

08:16.308 --> 08:32.445
woman.

08:35.207 --> 08:44.577
I've just always been here and I've always taught 
and I've become aware of the improvement of

08:35.207 --> 08:44.577
attitudes towards women. And as the years go by, 
there are more and more women. There's less and

08:49.537 --> 08:51.499
less discrimination against them. But there are 
still some Aggies who think the other way. If we

08:56.344 --> 09:09.018
could get all of the people from your A&M 
experience into one place, to which ones and for

08:56.344 --> 09:09.018
what would you most want to express your 
appreciation? Okay, Stanley Archer. Because he

09:11.405 --> 09:14.310
guided me all these years. He was one of the first 
people to

09:14.430 --> 09:27.451
recognize me as a faculty member, as opposed to 
another one of the teaching assistants, Frank

09:14.430 --> 09:27.451
Pierce. Because actually, Frank was very 
protective during those years. And he was one of

09:32.900 --> 09:35.083
the people that, for instance, Back then, you 
didn't have any choice about where and when you

09:35.452 --> 09:39.877
taught ordinarily. And they could just as soon 
send you a mile away. But Frank Pierce was always,

09:44.421 --> 09:52.450
like when I was having children and so forth, he 
always made sure my classes were relatively local

09:44.421 --> 09:52.450
and that they were at good hours. And he also, he was 
the first person to say, I called all these people

09:54.212 --> 10:00.278
doctor this and that. And Frank was the first 
person to say, call me Frank. And I appreciated

10:03.842 --> 10:05.003
that. Okay,

10:06.029 --> 10:16.364
Stanley Frank, Bedford Clark, but just he's my 
long-term friend here. I was here when they hired

10:16.384 --> 10:18.728
him. I think he was a great hire. He's always been 
around for good advice. Who else?

10:33.620 --> 10:35.342
Don't have to be in the department now. No, they 
don't have to be in the department. Anyone

10:37.004 --> 10:39.787
associated with A&M that you... Okay, Maxine 
Davenport, Manuel's first wife, and Manuel

10:39.807 --> 10:43.531
himself.

10:48.296 --> 10:56.505
Sylvia Greider, who also came in a long time ago and 
who has not contributed well by the system she's

10:48.296 --> 10:56.505
in. His name comes to

10:58.966 --> 11:17.672
mind always when I think of people not being seen 
well. An odd name that you may not even remember. Do

11:19.775 --> 11:20.616
you remember Pat Hunter? He taught everybody much 
food, but he was very kind to me and very helpful. He

11:24.161 --> 11:27.285
made all kinds of dreadful mistakes with other 
people. And he was best known for

11:28.278 --> 11:36.827
dragging in people to see the apartment had he let 
their class go by himself. He was not winning any

11:36.847 --> 11:39.529
friends at all. I was careful not to do that when my 
class was anywhere in the vicinity of parks. But he

11:43.273 --> 11:44.334
was very good to me. And so I would remember him. I 
would go to him for advice still.

11:52.142 --> 11:54.765
You know, when I think, except for Sylvia, these 
are all men. Catherine O'Keeffe is not here

11:55.285 --> 11:57.087
anymore.

12:02.399 --> 12:06.088
And I think that's about the list that people go to 
for advice. Well,

12:06.108 --> 12:14.248
let's finish the questions and then we'll think.

12:33.787 --> 12:38.235
I would want it for the establishment of an MFA 
program. A million dollars wouldn't go far in that

12:38.255 --> 12:40.900
direction. If I couldn't do that, then I wouldn't 
have speaker

12:40.920 --> 12:53.162
series, another instructor, whatever, in the 
area doing writing.

13:05.073 --> 13:15.026
It's

13:05.073 --> 13:15.026
been so long. I've been here since 1968. I've been 
teaching here since 1959. I taught elsewhere

13:21.454 --> 13:22.696
before and for one year during the country. But 
other than that, I know nothing. I don't know how

13:23.457 --> 13:28.484
the institution works. And I certainly enjoy 
teaching. And I'm feeling

13:32.883 --> 13:39.013
But other people from that time period. And now I'm 
beginning to see I've had the children of my first

13:39.433 --> 13:47.486
students. I figure when the grandchildren show 
up, it's probably going to be . And so I would say in

13:52.734 --> 13:58.303
many ways I do identify with a lot. But I'm not. I'm

14:02.617 --> 14:18.988
just trying to think of things.
