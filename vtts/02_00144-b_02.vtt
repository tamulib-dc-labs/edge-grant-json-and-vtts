WEBVTT

00:03.020 --> 00:08.760
I don't think that, I really don't think there 
should be any classes that size. I

00:10.700 --> 00:21.420
could see it maybe having a very distinguished 
lecture and then having a whole bunch of teaching

00:10.700 --> 00:21.420
assistants take them into separate sections, but 
that's not the way it happens there. They're in a

00:22.300 --> 00:25.380
class of 500 and then they have stand-up contests. 
And I don't think this is fair. So, more money needs

00:28.200 --> 00:34.350
to go into faculty and less into building. I think 
we spend a lot of money on building. And

00:37.810 --> 00:47.140
I was very glad to see a couple of years ago, or was it 
last year, that somebody decided simply that the

00:37.810 --> 00:47.140
money would go to the faculty. It would not go 
anywhere else.

00:53.280 --> 01:02.820
I want to see more of a place on teaching as 
something to be evaluated and to be a place to

00:53.280 --> 01:02.820
follow that forward.

01:05.840 --> 01:16.750
I want to see fewer committees and less committee 
work, because I think the people now in the

01:05.840 --> 01:16.750
community club and anywhere that's involved in 
committee work, they don't have time to do it.

01:20.360 --> 01:31.380
I'd

01:20.360 --> 01:31.380
like to see sabbaticals given more regularly and 
without complications. And

01:32.260 --> 01:37.880
I think it would be the case that somebody would 
find a good job for X number of years and do the

01:32.260 --> 01:37.880
sabbaticals. I think

01:37.860 --> 01:44.570
things would affect the whole. How

01:44.670 --> 01:50.480
about the enrollment? Yeah, I was just going to 
raise that issue. An admission requirement. I

01:56.630 --> 01:59.790
think that they should cap the enrollment. They 
already have that, haven't they? They have. They

02:04.223 --> 02:05.220
say they have.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.960
Raise the admission requirements.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.060
Encourage rather than discourage out-of-state 
enrollment for students. We're not going to have

02:20.300 --> 02:23.080
dozens, well, dozens, of course. We're not going 
to have thousands and thousands of people walking

02:23.160 --> 02:26.000
in. We're not going to be able to do that. We're

02:27.080 --> 02:34.220
going to make it a little more open to people from 
Pennsylvania and California. I

02:34.200 --> 02:44.710
think, too, that

02:34.200 --> 02:44.710
we should work with junior college systems to 
alleviate some of the fall-ins. And we are doing

02:44.690 --> 02:47.060
some of that. I know that we work with Glenn to 
alleviate the pressure on freshman students on

02:47.040 --> 02:53.060
technical writing. And this is Bill. What is your 
finding so far about the... What is your finding so

02:57.040 --> 02:58.041
far about the... quality of instruction that 
Glenn is giving? Well, on the basic level, it's

03:03.450 --> 03:06.470
pretty much the same. They're all our graduate 
students who are teaching here who are also

03:06.450 --> 03:10.470
teaching there. Okay. Who then, in some cases, 
graduate from here with their masters and go teach

03:11.798 --> 03:17.470
there full-time, often because they're married 
to somebody here. I don't think there's any

03:20.450 --> 03:23.470
problem with that. They have worse students. 
They've got some awful students over there. And

03:28.450 --> 03:31.780
sometimes the awful students will get through the 
courses. Just anybody who does all the work over

03:31.760 --> 03:34.780
there is going to get through. Nobody's going to 
fail except people who don't, who disappear at

03:34.760 --> 03:40.840
midterm. So we do get some people from Glenn that 
have high grades that aren't

03:40.820 --> 03:47.160
very good. But I don't think that they're getting 
bad courses over there. I think they're getting

03:50.140 --> 03:51.161
good courses. And, in fact, I think they're 
getting essentially our courses.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.841
I don't know. How do you feel? What is your thought 
about A&M Street here? Why don't you...

04:10.710 --> 04:13.160
We've done it. It should go down to, let's say, no 
more than 35.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.770
I don't know how to do this. This is not... But it 
would seem to be possible to do

04:27.750 --> 04:35.400
it. And I think a lot

04:35.380 --> 04:42.580
of it is. I read a lot of that document, and I 
thought, God. Some of it is very good, but a lot of it

04:45.680 --> 04:52.170
is very vague, too. I mean, we really need to have 
more instructors on all levels. And we need to

04:58.240 --> 05:05.080
have, to be competitive with UT, we need to have a 
lot more instructors. And that's in the report,

05:05.060 --> 05:07.080
but it's not specific to... I'm

05:07.060 --> 05:15.760
using the word instructor, meaning anyone who 
teaches... But I don't think that we can do it

05:15.740 --> 05:19.910
with... For a while, we had many, many lectures. I 
don't think this is a good idea because people who

05:23.330 --> 05:28.400
are really good instructors don't generally want 
to be lifetime lecturers. Lifetime lecturers...

05:30.380 --> 05:32.400
And we have a couple of lifetime lecturers who are 
excellent. So I think we need more tenure-track

05:33.380 --> 05:34.401
people. Have you spoken with her? There's 
somebody...

05:37.380 --> 05:41.280
No. No. Well, she's a lifetime lecturer. And she 
will tell you what this does. Because she's

05:44.260 --> 05:45.721
teaching... For a while. For a while. For a while. 
For a while. For a while. For a while. For a while.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.721
For a while. For a while. For a while. For a while. 
For a while. For a while. For a while. For a while.

06:02.700 --> 06:03.721
For a while. Because

06:03.700 --> 06:15.130
she's teaching

06:03.700 --> 06:15.130
essential classes, and yet, I think that there's a 
kind of bitterness on the part of lifetime

06:15.110 --> 06:17.910
lecturers, because they're not... And she is a 
senior lecturer, but we need to have better

06:17.890 --> 06:25.850
conditions for our lecturers.

06:25.830 --> 06:32.250
Alright, any female-related experiences, plus 
and minus, that you want to share that we haven't

06:32.230 --> 06:36.170
already done throughout all the years. 
Female-related? Yeah. Okay. Being a woman

06:39.676 --> 06:44.590
faculty member, the pluses or the minuses here? 
Well,

06:44.570 --> 06:57.260
I can think of lots of little slights from the old 
days, but nothing major.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.261
What about a positive? Were you, okay, the thing 
has turned, the tide is going the positive way?

07:06.930 --> 07:08.630
Being a female, I don't know. I do remember that 
when I was having children, my students did not

07:08.610 --> 07:15.530
approve of this. And one of them said to me, this is a 
negative experience, a core person said to me, I

07:15.510 --> 07:20.800
wouldn't let my wife be pregnant and teach. Here I 
was about eight months pregnant and I was

07:23.580 --> 07:29.080
teaching.

07:29.060 --> 07:30.341
And I don't remember what I said to him. I remember I 
looked at him in astonishment, but I don't

07:30.320 --> 07:34.540
remember, I don't think I had any snappy comeback. 
I think I just said, well, that's lovely for you and

07:35.520 --> 07:43.970
went on to something else. But

07:43.950 --> 07:48.350
I encountered that quite a bit. And it was kind of 
funny because there were a bunch of pregnant

07:48.330 --> 07:51.670
teachers in the English department at once. Pat 
Harris was in the department then and she was

07:53.270 --> 07:56.970
pregnant. And there was a woman named Judy Finn who 
hasn't been around for years and years and she was

08:00.030 --> 08:01.051
there. And we kind of took up the whole faculty 
room. But there was a certain amount of you

08:04.090 --> 08:12.820
shouldn't be here at that point that was not 
accepted. I can't think of any really awful. I

08:16.280 --> 08:28.000
never encountered.

08:27.980 --> 08:31.680
And nor can I think of anything astoundingly 
wonderful that happened to me here because I was a

08:31.660 --> 08:35.130
woman. I've just always been here and I've always 
taught and I've become aware of the improvement of

08:43.060 --> 08:45.340
attitudes towards women. And as the years go by, 
there are more and more women. There's less and

08:49.660 --> 08:52.020
less discrimination against them. But there are 
still some Aggies who think. If we could get all of

08:56.330 --> 09:00.850
the people from your A&M experience to come here 
and talk to you, and to one place, to which ones and

09:00.830 --> 09:08.970
for what would you most want to express your 
appreciation? To who? Okay, Stanley Archer.

09:10.950 --> 09:11.962
Because? Because he guided me all these years. He 
was one of the first people to, what, to recognize

09:14.210 --> 09:23.060
me as a faculty member as opposed to another one of 
the teaching assistants. Frank Pierce. Because

09:27.263 --> 09:29.770
actually Frank was very protective during those 
years. He was a very good teacher. He was a very good

09:30.750 --> 09:31.771
teacher. And he was one of the people that, for 
instance, back then you didn't have any choice

09:31.750 --> 09:38.150
about where and when you taught ordinarily. And 
they could just as soon send you a mile away. But

09:44.650 --> 09:48.610
Frank Pierce was always, like when I was having 
children and so forth, he always made sure my

09:48.590 --> 09:54.670
classes were relatively local and that they were 
at good hours. And he also, he was the first person

09:54.650 --> 09:59.890
to say, we all, I called all these people doctor 
this and that. And Frank was the first person to

10:00.920 --> 10:03.930
say, call me Frank. And I appreciated that. 
Stanley

10:06.060 --> 10:17.500
Frank, Bedford Clark, but just, he's my long-term 
friend here. I was here when they hired him, I think

10:17.480 --> 10:21.760
he was a great hire, he's always been around for 
good advice. Who else? Don't have to be in the

10:24.366 --> 10:33.660
department now, anyone. Oh, they don't have to be 
in the department. Anyone associated with A&M

10:37.300 --> 10:39.650
that you. Okay, Maxine Davenport, Manuel's first 
wife. And Manuel himself. Sylvia

10:43.470 --> 11:14.280
Grider, who also came in a long time ago and who has 
not contributed .

11:14.260 --> 11:21.750
And

11:14.260 --> 11:21.750
he taught everybody much good, but he was very kind 
to me and very helpful. And he made all kinds of

11:21.730 --> 11:27.640
dreadful mistakes with other people. And he was 
best known for dragging

11:27.620 --> 11:35.500
in people to see the department had he let their 
plans go by himself. He was not winning any friends

11:36.480 --> 11:38.500
at all. I was careful not to do that. I did that when 
my class was anywhere in the vicinity of parks. But

11:43.480 --> 11:44.501
he was very good to me. And so I would remember him, I 
would go to him for advice. You

11:47.480 --> 11:55.350
know, when I'm thinking, except for Sylvia, these 
are all men. Catherine O'Keeffe is not here

11:55.330 --> 11:57.350
anymore. She's at Notre

11:57.330 --> 12:04.800
Dame. Well, we can

12:04.780 --> 12:34.280
go to her for

12:04.780 --> 12:34.280
advice. I would want it for the establishment of an 
MFA program. A million dollars wouldn't go far in

12:37.260 --> 12:40.280
that direction. If I couldn't do that, then I 
wouldn't have. This is very, very important.

12:43.260 --> 12:50.151
Thank

12:43.260 --> 12:50.151
you. ?

13:08.580 --> 13:10.600
It's been, it's been took so long now. I've been 
here since 1958 and I've been teaching here since

13:10.580 --> 13:13.600
1969. I taught elsewhere before and for one year 
during the time period. But other than that, I know

13:17.580 --> 13:20.600
nothing, I don't know how other institutions 
work. And I certainly enjoyed teaching here. I was

13:24.580 --> 13:28.840
still in college. I'm

13:28.820 --> 13:40.840
still in contact with many students, some of them 
even going back, I'm not in contact with other

13:28.820 --> 13:40.840
people from that time period. And now I'm 
beginning to see, I've had the children of my first

13:40.820 --> 13:50.300
student, I figure when the grandchildren show up, 
I'm probably going to retire. So, I would say, in

13:50.280 --> 14:03.380
many ways, I do identify with Texas A&M a lot, but 
I'm not a traditional student. Every

14:03.360 --> 14:09.030
elementary school student identifies with Texas 
A&M. Okay,

14:09.010 --> 14:20.590
I'm just trying to think of things at the very 
beginning.
