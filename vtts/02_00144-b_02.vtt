WEBVTT

00:03.020 --> 00:08.760
I don't think that, I really don't think there 
should be any classes that size. I

00:10.700 --> 00:21.420
could see it maybe having a very distinguished 
lecture and then having a whole bunch of teaching

00:10.700 --> 00:21.420
assistants take them into separate sections, but 
that's not the way it happens there. They're in a

00:22.300 --> 00:25.380
class of 500 and then they have stand-up contests. 
And I don't think this is fair. So, more money needs

00:28.200 --> 00:34.350
to go into faculty and less into building. I think 
we spend a lot of money on building. And

00:37.810 --> 00:48.540
I was very glad to see a couple of years ago, was it 
last year, that somebody decided simply that the

00:37.810 --> 00:48.540
money would go to the faculty, it would not go 
anywhere else.

00:53.280 --> 01:02.800
I want to see more of a place on teaching as 
something to be evaluated and to make the most of

00:53.280 --> 01:02.800
all of that support.

01:05.840 --> 01:16.750
I want to see fewer committees and less committee 
work because I think the people now, in any type of

01:05.840 --> 01:16.750
any way that's involved in committee work, they 
don't have time to do it.

01:20.400 --> 01:31.380
I'd

01:20.400 --> 01:31.380
like to see sabbaticals given more regularly and 
without complications. And

01:32.260 --> 01:39.000
I think it would be the case that somebody would 
find a good job for X number of years and do the

01:32.260 --> 01:39.000
sabbaticals and have to do it for it.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.571
Things that would affect the whole. How

01:44.670 --> 01:50.480
about the enrollment? Yeah, I was just going to 
raise that issue. An admission requirement. I

01:56.650 --> 01:59.790
think that they should cap the enrollment. They 
already have that, haven't they? They have. They

02:04.223 --> 02:05.200
say they have.

02:08.140 --> 02:09.940
Raise the admission requirement.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.060
Encourage rather than discourage out-of-state 
enrollment for students. We're not going to have

02:20.540 --> 02:23.080
dozens, well, dozens of courses. We're not going 
to have thousands and thousands of people walking

02:23.140 --> 02:26.000
in. We're not going to be able to do that. We'll

02:27.080 --> 02:34.720
make it a little more open to people from 
Pennsylvania and California. I think, too, that

02:34.700 --> 02:44.710
we should work with junior college systems to 
alleviate some of the follow-ups. And we are doing

02:44.690 --> 02:47.060
some of that. I know that we work with Glenn to 
alleviate the pressure on freshman teachers and

02:47.040 --> 02:53.060
technical writing. And this is Bill. What is your 
finding so far about the... What is your finding so

02:57.040 --> 02:58.061
far about the... quality of instruction Glenn is 
giving? Well,

03:01.040 --> 03:06.490
on the basic level, it's pretty much the same. 
They're all our graduate students who are

03:06.470 --> 03:10.490
teaching here who are also teaching there. Okay. 
Who then, in some cases, graduate from here with

03:11.798 --> 03:17.490
their masters and go teach there full-time, often 
because they're married to somebody here. I don't

03:20.470 --> 03:23.490
think there's any problem with that. They have 
worse students. They've got some awful students

03:25.470 --> 03:28.490
over there. And sometimes the awful students will 
get through the courses. Just anybody who does all

03:31.780 --> 03:34.800
the work over there is going to get through. 
Nobody's going to fail except people who don't,

03:34.780 --> 03:40.860
who disappear at midterm. So we do get some people 
from Glenn that have high grades that aren't

03:40.840 --> 03:47.180
very good. But I don't think that they're getting 
bad courses over there. I think they're getting

03:50.160 --> 03:51.181
good courses. And, in fact, I think they're 
getting essentially our courses.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.861
I don't know. How do you feel? What is your thought 
about A&M Street here, Wanda? We've

04:01.840 --> 04:10.750
done it.

04:10.730 --> 04:13.180
And really should reduce... It should go down to, 
let's say, no more than 35. I

04:19.520 --> 04:26.790
don't know how to do this. This is not... But it 
would seem to be possible to do it. And I think a lot

04:35.400 --> 04:42.600
of it is. I read a lot of that document, and I 
thought, God. Some of it is very good, but a lot of it

04:45.700 --> 04:52.190
is very vague, too. I mean, we really need to have 
more instructors on all levels. And we need to

04:58.260 --> 05:05.100
have, to be competitive with UT, we need to have a 
lot more instructors. And that's in the report,

05:05.080 --> 05:09.100
but it's not specifically... I'm

05:09.080 --> 05:17.930
using the word instructor meaning anyone who 
teaches...

05:17.910 --> 05:21.370
But I don't think that we can do it with... For a 
while we had many, many lectures. I don't think

05:24.350 --> 05:31.420
this is a good idea because people who are really 
good instructors don't generally want to be

05:24.350 --> 05:31.420
lifetime... But we've had many, many people pass 
through here, some of whom were terrible.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.740
So I think we need more tenure-track people. And 
those lectures we do have, we need to treat well,

05:45.720 --> 05:52.740
and we need to make them senior lecturers so that 
somebody, for instance, like Dorothy Van

05:45.720 --> 05:52.740
Ryber... Have you spoken with her? No. Well,

05:55.606 --> 06:00.740
she's a lifetime lecturer. And she will tell you 
what this does.

06:07.080 --> 06:13.330
So she's teaching

06:07.080 --> 06:13.330
essential classes. And yet I think that there's a 
kind of bitterness on the part of lifetime

06:13.310 --> 06:18.330
lecturers because they're not... And she is a 
senior lecturer, but we need to have better

06:18.310 --> 06:25.470
conditions for our lecturers. All right. Any 
female-related experiences, plus and minus,

06:27.558 --> 06:36.530
that you want to share that we haven't already done 
throughout all the years? Female-related? Yeah.

06:39.510 --> 06:40.478
Okay. Any female faculty member, the pluses or the 
minuses here? Well,

06:44.510 --> 06:57.020
I can think of lots of little slights from the old 
days, but nothing major.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.021
What about a positive? Okay, the thing has turned. 
The tide is going the positive way. Being a female,

07:06.690 --> 07:08.710
I don't know. I do remember that when I was having 
children, my students did not approve of this.

07:15.690 --> 07:16.711
None of them said to me. This is a negative 
experience. A core person said to me, I wouldn't

07:18.720 --> 07:23.740
let my wife be pregnant and teach. Here I was about 
eight months pregnant, and I was teaching.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.620
And I don't remember what I said to him. I remember I 
looked at him in astonishment, but I don't

07:30.600 --> 07:33.620
remember. I don't think I had any snappy comeback. 
I think I just said, well, that's lovely for you,

07:35.600 --> 07:42.990
and went on to something else. But I encountered 
that quite a bit. And it was kind of funny because

07:47.530 --> 07:51.550
there were a bunch of pregnant teachers in the 
English department at once. Pat Harris was in the

07:52.530 --> 07:56.550
department then, and she was pregnant. And there 
was a woman named Judy Finn who hasn't been around

07:56.530 --> 07:59.550
for years and years, and she was there. And we kind 
of took up the whole faculty room. But there was a

08:03.530 --> 08:11.550
certain amount of you shouldn't be here at that 
point that was not accepted. I can't think of any

08:11.530 --> 08:16.060
really awful. I never encountered. And

08:18.040 --> 08:31.260
nor can I think of anything astoundingly 
wonderful that happened to me here because I was a

08:31.240 --> 08:34.730
woman. I've just always been here, and I've always 
taught. And I've become aware of the improvement

08:37.710 --> 08:44.780
of attitudes towards women. And as the years go by, 
there are more and more women. There's less and

08:48.760 --> 08:51.780
less discrimination against them. But there are 
still some Aggies who. If we could get all of the

08:56.390 --> 08:59.410
people from your A&M experience, into one place, 
to which ones and for what would you most want to

08:59.390 --> 09:09.410
express your appreciation? Stanley Archer. 
Because? Because he guided me all these years. He

09:14.390 --> 09:22.380
was one of the first people to recognize me as a 
faculty member, as opposed to another one of the

09:22.360 --> 09:26.440
teaching assistants. Frank Pierce. Because 
actually Frank was very protective during those

09:28.651 --> 09:32.590
years. And he was one of the people that, for 
instance, back then you didn't have any choice

09:35.570 --> 09:40.590
about where and when you taught ordinarily. And 
they could just as soon send you a mile away. But

09:44.570 --> 09:47.590
Frank Pierce was always, like when I was having 
children and so forth, he always made sure my

09:47.570 --> 09:54.590
classes were relatively local and that they were 
at good hours. And he also, he was the first person

09:54.570 --> 09:56.590
to say, we all, I called all these people doctor 
this and that. And Frank was the first person to

10:00.570 --> 10:03.590
say, call me Frank. And I appreciated that. 
Stanley

10:06.720 --> 10:11.940
Frank. Bedford Clark, but just, he's my long-term 
friend here. I was here when they hired him. I think

10:18.380 --> 10:20.400
he was a great hire. He's always been around for 
good advice. Who else?

10:33.875 --> 10:35.300
Don't have to be in the department now. Anyone. Oh, 
they don't have to be in the department. Anyone

10:37.280 --> 10:38.301
associated with A&M that you. Okay, Maxine 
Davenport, Manuel's first wife. And Manuel

10:42.330 --> 10:47.960
himself.

10:47.940 --> 10:55.140
Sylvia Grider, who also came in a long time ago and 
who has not contributed. . And he

10:55.400 --> 11:19.610
taught

10:55.400 --> 11:19.610
everybody much good. But he was very kind to me and 
very helpful. And he made all kinds of dreadful

11:21.590 --> 11:27.500
mistakes with other people. And he was best known 
for dragging

11:27.480 --> 11:34.400
in people to see the department had he let their 
class go by himself. He was not winning any friends

11:36.380 --> 11:39.400
at all. I was careful not to do that when my class was 
anywhere in the vicinity of parks. But he was very

11:43.380 --> 11:44.401
good to me. And so I would remember him. I would go to 
him for advice still. You know, when I think,

11:49.380 --> 11:55.250
except for Sylvia, these are all men. Catherine 
O'Keeffe is not here anymore. She's at Notre Dame.

11:59.760 --> 12:34.180
Well,

11:59.760 --> 12:34.180
go to her for advice.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.180
I would want it for the establishment of the MFA 
program. You know, a million dollars wouldn't go

12:37.160 --> 12:40.180
far in that direction. If I couldn't do that, then I 
wouldn't have a speaker series, another

12:46.160 --> 12:52.650
instructor, whatever, in the area of doing life. 
It's

12:52.630 --> 13:08.500
been such a long time. I've been here since 1968. 
I've been teaching here since 1969. I taught

13:13.480 --> 13:17.500
elsewhere before and for one year during the time 
period. But other than that, I know nothing. I

13:20.480 --> 13:23.500
don't know how all the institutions work. And I've 
certainly enjoyed teaching. I'm still in contact

13:28.720 --> 13:31.740
with many students. Some of them even going back 
today. I'm not in contact with them. But

13:35.720 --> 13:42.020
other people from that time period. And now I'm 
beginning to see I've had the children of my first

13:42.000 --> 13:47.200
students. I figure when the grandchildren show 
up, they're probably going to retire. So

13:51.180 --> 13:58.760
I would say, in many ways, I do identify with Texas 
A&M a lot. But I'm not a traditional student.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.930
There's other elements of the state that I 
identify with. Okay.

14:17.901 --> 14:20.490
I'm just trying to think of things at the very 
beginning.
