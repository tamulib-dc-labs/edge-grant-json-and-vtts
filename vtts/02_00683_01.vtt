WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:25.701
Well

00:01.769 --> 00:25.701
today

00:01.769 --> 00:25.701
is November the 16th and I'm interviewing Dr. Dan 
Householder who has been at Texas A&M since 1975

00:01.769 --> 00:25.701
and we're going to talk about, has been in the 
Department of Industrial and Vocational

00:25.867 --> 00:27.810
Education, IBTE. And we're going to talk a little 
bit about changes and things that have happened at

00:28.491 --> 00:40.909
Texas A&M in the last few years and what kinds of 
things have affected these changes from your

00:28.491 --> 00:40.909
perception. And you have been department head for 
the last 10 years. So a lot of things have happened

00:47.478 --> 00:52.245
in this department, I'm sure, as well as in the 
college and from your perceptions, what have been

00:52.732 --> 00:55.735
some of the major changes? You could start with 
your department as you see it, and then maybe go on

00:57.256 --> 01:04.463
into the college itself or vice versa. Well, the 
college has certainly come along trying to meet

01:04.483 --> 01:10.289
contemporary needs. I think when I came here, 
there was something of a dichotomy between the

01:12.171 --> 01:22.080
research-oriented doctoral programs and the 
heavy emphasis on meeting public school needs,

01:23.039 --> 01:31.088
which certainly reflected the leadership that 
had been here before. But in industrial

01:31.108 --> 01:41.861
education, there had been a doctoral program 
started in 63, which is some six years before there

01:31.108 --> 01:41.861
was a college of education. Who was instrumental 
in that, do you know? Well, yes. That really grew

01:44.864 --> 01:52.793
out of Chris Donovan's work and

01:44.864 --> 01:52.793
Eric Blaisman's work. They were in the College of 
Engineering. And the Department of Industrial

01:56.235 --> 02:07.185
Education started the industrial technology 
program, the industrial distribution program,

01:56.235 --> 02:07.185
and the engineering technology programs. When 
the College of Education was formed, Dr. Boone

02:07.205 --> 02:15.393
moved to the college with Dr. Les Hawkins and Don 
Clark. The other people stayed in engineering and

02:15.413 --> 02:21.379
built the technology program. If you would 
identify a pivotal time in the life of this

02:23.030 --> 02:30.659
department, that was certainly it. And opinions 
differ still about whether that was a wise move in

02:31.100 --> 02:46.278
that programs in industrial education rely so 
heavily on the technologies that you can't get in a

02:31.100 --> 02:46.278
college of education. So if you look across the 
country, doctoral programs in our field that have

02:46.298 --> 02:52.125
a strong technological base have a big advantage 
over those that are housed in colleges of

02:52.612 --> 03:04.046
education, where there's this tendency not to 
want to deal with the laboratories and not to want

02:52.612 --> 03:04.046
to deal with the technical instruction. That is a 
tendency in the colleges of education? Yes. Not

03:07.230 --> 03:08.892
just here. Interesting. OK. But all that happened 
long before I came. OK. So then what started

03:15.761 --> 03:17.523
happening when you came? I came here because of the 
strength of the doctoral program in industrial

03:17.543 --> 03:20.366
ed. I'd known it for a long time. And we've ranked 
third for a number of years behind Ohio State and

03:22.902 --> 03:32.517
Maryland. So, well, over the years, as fields have 
evolved, some things have been put positive and

03:32.537 --> 03:40.929
some negative. You see a lot of growing strength in 
educational technology, for instance, which was

03:40.949 --> 03:51.846
started by this department, I understand, long 
before I came here. The safety education program

03:52.602 --> 03:57.187
was developed quite a bit. That was course started

03:57.207 --> 04:13.784
and the

03:57.207 --> 04:13.784
department is still there. The copy center began 
in this department. We're still dealing, I think,

04:14.925 --> 04:20.871
a lot with the role of the department and maybe the 
college in preparing for the school teachers.

04:22.133 --> 04:28.000
And, of course, recent developments with homes 
and whatever have put that in even more jeopardy.

04:28.020 --> 04:32.206
No one is quite

04:28.020 --> 04:32.206
sure what happens. What the consequences are, the 
results or whatever, or how long it's going to take

04:32.246 --> 04:38.814
to see them. Well, that's going to be a biggie. Are 
there other things, were there some political or

04:40.837 --> 04:50.689
sociological or even psychological, I mean, 
philosophical changes? influences that might

04:50.973 --> 04:59.967
have had an effect on some of the changes that came 
about in the department?

05:00.127 --> 05:03.011
Do you have a department philosophy for starters? 
Unfortunately, no. The group has never really

05:06.076 --> 05:12.406
developed a coherent position. They're really a 
group of specialists who each want autonomy in

05:13.027 --> 05:19.056
their own specialty. Now I think in one sense the 
department has reflected in MicroCollege and the

05:20.926 --> 05:42.391
stresses that go between folks who are very 
interested in research and uninterested in

05:20.926 --> 05:42.391
teacher education to people who are very 
interested in teacher education and relatively

05:20.926 --> 05:42.391
less interested in research. And in fact, I'm not 
sure the college has ever been deeply committed to

05:44.073 --> 05:49.600
research. I'm

05:51.014 --> 06:07.560
sure that the department's ambiguities reflect 
that or maybe are maintained partially because of

05:51.014 --> 06:07.560
our lack of a coherent statement. Whether we are 
really a research college of education or a

06:07.580 --> 06:15.833
service college of education. What do you think 
they tend to lean more to? The emphasis in the

06:19.145 --> 06:23.610
college has gone clearly toward undergraduate 
teacher education. You

06:23.630 --> 06:28.454
mean right now, or it has been going? Throughout 
our history. OK. Do you foresee any changes in

06:31.377 --> 06:36.202
that? Yes, I think that is changing, and it seems 
almost imperative that it changes. If the college

06:43.610 --> 06:48.595
is to build its stature among other colleges of 
education,

06:53.198 --> 07:02.130
If the college wants to serve the schools of Texas, 
it probably won't do it at the research base, much

06:53.198 --> 07:02.130
as we talk about this. But researchers are 
hard-nosed people who don't worry so much about

07:02.631 --> 07:08.458
the outcomes. And educators, teachers, and 
teacher educators tend to worry more about

07:08.478 --> 07:21.636
processes and the development of the individual 
rather than the search for. Semi-pro.

07:26.485 --> 07:26.705
Semi-pro. Even a good generalization is hard to 
come by without being a hard-nosed researcher.

07:34.235 --> 07:47.573
Well,

07:34.235 --> 07:47.573
that's one of the questions that I had about 
whether or not or to what extent the college was

07:34.235 --> 07:47.573
achieving its mission or maybe this Department of 
Teaching, Research, and Service. And how did the

07:48.354 --> 07:50.897
department balance it And how do you balance your 
own, according to your own philosophy? Do you put

07:57.118 --> 08:01.261
equal emphasis on all, or are there some that are 
more important? Well, the model of the

08:01.762 --> 08:12.952
teacher-researcher

08:01.762 --> 08:12.952
professional servant, I think, is a generally 
accepted one. But you can't do all those things all

08:12.972 --> 08:17.577
the time equally well. I just came back from 
chairing a conference in Chicago, and I chair this

08:21.472 --> 08:25.697
thing every year and have now for eight years. It's 
an enormous commitment to professional service

08:27.119 --> 08:33.947
to one organization. I've been trying to just 
guess a month a year maybe that I spend on this one

08:34.007 --> 08:40.094
activity. Our college, and certainly in the 
department, has made really major commitments to

08:40.114 --> 08:49.765
service to professional organizations. I don't 
know that that's wrong, But I don't think we've

08:51.357 --> 09:01.035
been willing to face its cost in terms of research 
productivity and in terms of teaching

08:51.357 --> 09:01.035
effectiveness. Because you aren't teaching when 
you're away from campus. And our college has a

09:06.566 --> 09:11.475
strong commitment to professional service.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.503
What organization are you referring to in this 
case? Well, this is the Mississippi Valley

09:16.523 --> 09:22.812
Industrial Teacher Education Conference that I 
was finished chairing. You're saying that

09:22.852 --> 09:25.616
everybody tends to do a lot of this? In our 
department, everybody has been very active in

09:25.796 --> 09:30.904
their professional organizations. All of the 
senior faculty have been presidents of some

09:31.044 --> 09:37.954
organization, of some major organization. And 
that's really more service than anything else?

09:41.358 --> 09:44.463
Yes, I perceive that as a strong service. It's 
service to the profession. And some of the people

09:46.847 --> 09:54.078
who haven't yet been presidents are, for 
instance, on editorial boards where they read

09:46.847 --> 09:54.078
manuscripts. It's one of those behind the scenes 
things that takes hours and hours and hours of

09:55.360 --> 10:07.399
faculty time and doesn't really generate 
anything but one line in a vitae, if they remember

09:55.360 --> 10:07.399
it. a number of the people have been pretty 
committed to service to the public schools. That

10:14.048 --> 10:20.900
has, it seems to me, vacillated over time, that is, 
if you look back over a long-term perspective.

10:21.461 --> 10:26.891
Different groups have been effective in serving 
different clienteles over, during different

10:21.461 --> 10:26.891
periods. Sometimes you meet the need, sometimes 
you move on to other things, but They'll work with

10:32.945 --> 10:41.737
local service agencies, say that Dr. Parrish does 
with Vocational Special Needs and the agencies

10:32.945 --> 10:41.737
that serve those people. It's in, by our 
definition, the service category. We've not, I

10:48.887 --> 10:54.555
think, balanced teaching and research as well as 
we would lie. And as I say, in my opinion, they are

10:54.575 --> 11:02.125
almost dichotomous interests One requires a wait 
and see attitude. The other is I can make it better.

11:09.866 --> 11:14.432
And if you're committed to making it better, 
you'll never wait and see. And I see relatively few

11:16.294 --> 11:21.199
in our college who've been really deeply 
committed to research. In the whole college, not

11:21.580 --> 11:23.262
just in your department. Yes, and it's certainly 
true in the department, and I see it true in the

11:23.282 --> 11:26.445
college. I get the feeling from other interviews 
that the EDs EPSI department feels very strongly

11:32.294 --> 11:38.784
that they're much more committed to research than 
anybody else. They certainly feel that way.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.653
They're all very vocal. They certainly feel that 
way. They certainly feel that way. Okay. Now, the

11:51.664 --> 11:55.950
growth since you arrived and since you've been 
here has been phenomenal. And I'm assuming in the

11:55.990 --> 12:00.297
department, has the department grown much? No. 
The only growing program in the department left

12:01.150 --> 12:03.793
the department. Which was? Educational 
technology. Where did it go? To

12:10.679 --> 12:17.246
interdisciplinary

12:10.679 --> 12:17.246
education. How does that come about? Why did it 
leave and why does it fit in there better? I'm not

12:21.250 --> 12:24.233
familiar at all with that process. Well, I'm not 
certain that I want to comment about that on the

12:24.653 --> 12:28.457
record. It was never discussed with me before it 
was done. As far from my perspective, it was an

12:33.674 --> 12:39.302
arbitrary administrative action. How long has 
that been? Has that been? A year ago last month, 15.

12:47.233 --> 12:47.573
OK. So then what is the size of the department right 
now, student-wise? Do you have just more or less a?

12:53.381 --> 12:54.282
I don't have the data. Well, that's right. You're 
not department head right now. OK. But our

12:59.437 --> 13:03.322
undergraduate enrollments have been declining 
for the past several years. And we are fighting

13:03.843 --> 13:09.551
along with everybody else in our field to maintain 
graduate enrollments. The peculiar thing that we

13:09.571 --> 13:22.369
cannot maintain graduate enrollments, we 
cannot, and this is true not just here, it's true at

13:09.571 --> 13:22.369
Ohio State, it's true at Maryland, it's true at 
Illinois, it's true at Minnesota. And in our

13:22.389 --> 13:29.038
conference, we're very concerned about where our 
future generations of teacher educators come

13:22.389 --> 13:29.038
from. Because graduate programs, advanced 
graduate programs, are not preparing a number of

13:29.812 --> 13:39.106
people that the demand surveys indicate are 
needed. In just industrial and vocational?

13:42.571 --> 13:45.174
Industrial and vocational technical education. 
I'm not going to try to speak about the others,

13:45.295 --> 13:52.565
because this group that I just met with deals with 
industrial teacher education. And that's the

13:52.585 --> 13:56.511
group that we had some papers on this this time. 
Does the pendulum swing back and forth on that, or

13:57.065 --> 14:02.932
has it continued to decline steadily? It's really 
hard to tell. I tend right now toward a great deal of

14:06.296 --> 14:18.990
pessimism in that I cannot identify a dean of 
education who thinks that industrial education

14:06.296 --> 14:18.990
or technical education is important. We're in the 
midst of a major back-to-basics

14:19.010 --> 14:24.777
move. It's just not popular to say. It may be right 
or it may be wrong. The people may be right now. But

14:33.585 --> 14:37.190
it is not popular to say we should strengthen 
industrial education.

14:45.924 --> 14:50.832
Collaboration among the department that you have 
been And again, I'm referring to this one because

14:50.980 --> 14:59.316
you were head of the department for the last 10 
years, so that's the one that I'm focusing on

14:50.980 --> 14:59.316
because I don't know enough about that department 
to have a feel for it. Was there a lot of

15:01.079 --> 15:09.335
collaboration among, well, within departments 
and then among this department with other

15:01.079 --> 15:09.335
departments in the college? Well, my... I think 
there's a disappointingly low level of

15:13.188 --> 15:18.896
collaboration with the department. There has 
been some, in bits of referral, collaborative

15:18.916 --> 15:24.904
efforts. Not only with other, actually, some 
better with people outside the college than with

15:25.304 --> 15:34.377
others within the college.

15:35.618 --> 15:41.406
It's one of those things that I've puzzled over a 
great deal and not been able to diagnose.

15:42.736 --> 15:51.507
My perception has been that our group has wanted to 
collaborate, but has not been successful as it

15:42.736 --> 15:51.507
would like to be in that process. In the college? 
Yes. Does the specialization that you were

15:55.372 --> 16:01.399
talking about earlier have something to do with 
the fact that everybody is . I think that people

16:01.419 --> 16:11.612
might have, I don't know whether people have a 
narrow image of the professionals who work in the

16:12.622 --> 16:15.706
group or not. That could be the case. It's an 
interesting dynamic, which I don't have

16:20.253 --> 16:22.997
diagnosed.

16:25.481 --> 16:28.125
But department heads do not collaborate in this 
college. Department heads have never shared

16:28.866 --> 16:40.823
secrets, have always viewed them, in my 
experience, have always viewed themselves as

16:28.866 --> 16:40.823
competing.

16:41.309 --> 16:51.822
No, there's never even an opportunity for 
department heads to meet without the dean staff

16:41.309 --> 16:51.822
being present. Competing for resources, you 
think? In my opinion, that has been a major

16:54.205 --> 17:01.875
inhibiting factor from the time I've been here. 
The idea that the leadership comes from the dean's

17:02.295 --> 17:11.046
office instead of growing out of the group that can 
facilitate the interaction. And it's been my

17:11.448 --> 17:32.413
impression that

17:11.448 --> 17:32.413
collaboration among department heads is viewed 
negatively from all levels above and below rather

17:11.448 --> 17:32.413
than being a way for things to occur. All of the 
inquiry groups did not look at helping department

17:34.376 --> 17:38.721
heads departments collaborate. They look at 
giving faculty the kind of collaborative

17:40.624 --> 17:44.849
opportunities they were looking for. But faculty 
have never seen... We're in a peculiar

17:45.370 --> 18:00.089
organizational dilemma in this college because 
we have a formal structure and it's as if that

17:45.370 --> 18:00.089
formal structure is set aside and used only to do 
some things. What is the formal structure that you

18:00.850 --> 18:02.712
refer to? Well, the departmental structure. Oh, 
okay. As compared to, say, a faculty structure

18:04.595 --> 18:08.640
that some universities have or program 
structures that some universities have. So the

18:15.086 --> 18:21.612
university expects department heads to perform 
in a peculiar way, but never to collaborate. There

18:21.693 --> 18:24.255
is not anything that rewards collaboration.

18:28.780 --> 18:29.360
Interesting. You hit a sensitive point with that 
question. Well, I haven't gotten as strong a

18:36.970 --> 18:38.732
response from a lot of people. Maybe a lot of people 
are not being candid enough with me, but I have not

18:38.932 --> 18:42.757
gotten that strong. Everybody has said there's 
not enough, and we should do better, but nobody has

18:43.758 --> 18:49.244
said it. I may not be right about this, but it's 
really important

18:49.304 --> 19:02.640
to know that after only a few months away from this 
role, it's difficult to see the positive things

19:03.447 --> 19:09.372
that may have been going on.

19:10.814 --> 19:22.184
For instance, I think we did a lot of collaborative 
things with educational technology, but then

19:10.814 --> 19:22.184
when educational technology chose to leave, 
there wasn't any discussion of what would be the

19:10.814 --> 19:22.184
best for all people concerned. The decision was, I 
mean, the move was made by going around the group

19:23.525 --> 19:30.872
that it facilitated. So I don't think that's 
collaboration by any definition. And I've never

19:36.799 --> 19:43.486
chosen to seek out as if one might try to diagnose 
what's going on there. But it certainly does

19:43.686 --> 19:48.831
diminish one's interest in doing more 
collaboration.

19:51.594 --> 19:53.135
Good. Perceptions. And you've touched on a little 
bit about perceptions of outsiders and how this

19:54.917 --> 20:00.623
college is viewed. a little bit about how certain 
departments in the college are viewed in

20:00.890 --> 20:11.423
reference to other similar colleges or similar 
education. As you work with these organizations

20:11.443 --> 20:19.432
and travel a lot and go outside of here, what do you 
feel is the perception of others towards the

20:11.443 --> 20:19.432
college? And is A&M still number three behind like 
it was when you came in this department?

20:28.970 --> 20:30.592
You've got to look at it in different ways. I was 
only talking about the doctoral program. That's

20:33.415 --> 20:34.276
right, you were. That program has, until this 
year, maintained its visibility and stature. We

20:43.147 --> 20:49.955
draw people from all across the country, some 
international students, and we place people. The

20:49.975 --> 20:54.900
VOED program has never made it to the top ranks. 
It's much younger, and has not had the faculty and

20:58.265 --> 21:06.859
students since the fellowship program was 
discontinued. Oh, by much younger. How young is

21:07.861 --> 21:09.604
it? Do you know? No. OK. Was it before the College of 
Education came in to be? I don't think so. It was the

21:17.357 --> 21:19.441
EPDA fellowship program. Oh, OK. It was all to 
identify that starting date. OK. It seems like it

21:24.303 --> 21:32.155
would have been in the late 60s, but I don't think 
the program had started before the college was

21:24.303 --> 21:32.155
formed. I wasn't here. Okay. Did you work under 
both Beans? Yes. Okay. And Lindbacher in between.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.586
And Lindbacher. Okay. Tell me a little bit about 
the differences, and I've gotten a lot on the

21:40.908 --> 21:51.424
leadership styles, and it's obvious, it's a 
tremendous change, but From your department,

21:51.843 --> 22:03.100
what were some of the changes or some of the 
differences in just the everyday running of the

21:51.843 --> 22:03.100
department under the two administrations? And 
even Limbocker's. I haven't really focused on

22:06.164 --> 22:08.908
that interim year. That interim year was a 
devastating year for this department. How so? The

22:16.259 --> 22:20.065
laboratory building next door was being 
renovated that year. There were no laboratories

22:20.085 --> 22:21.647
at all. We had equipment in the basement of this 
building and were teaching our undergraduate

22:22.032 --> 22:29.101
classes in the basement of this building in the 
hallway. And I could get no support from the dean to

22:31.044 --> 22:39.155
seek other space on a temporary basis or do 
anything. And we, in essence, undid our

22:39.175 --> 22:45.743
undergraduate program during that time. We had, 
until then, we had absolutely a top-flight group

22:45.763 --> 22:50.790
of undergraduate students. And because the 
dean's office was totally disinterested in what

22:51.395 --> 22:59.765
we needed with this situation. So that was a 
disaster year for us. And it had nothing to do with

23:06.833 --> 23:12.540
personalities, because I got along fine with all 
three people. But because of our lack of

23:12.560 --> 23:18.887
leadership, lack of commitment, we really 
suffered. Now, what is the deal across the street

23:19.897 --> 23:22.721
that you refer to? What laboratory or what goes on 
over there? Our undergraduates have to be

23:25.886 --> 23:30.853
prepared to teach their technical subjects 
somewhere. And during that era, we could not get

23:31.334 --> 23:36.221
any of them into any of the engineering technology 
courses. We were having the same problem that

23:36.241 --> 23:39.486
every freshman counselor has been having this 
year. All the engineering technology courses

23:40.848 --> 23:43.873
were full if one of our students got in. And we were 
requiring them. So we had to develop our own

23:46.396 --> 23:48.840
courses. which means we had to have our own 
laboratories or someplace to teach them. And we

23:54.616 --> 24:10.103
had a woodworking, metalworking, power, 
construction, manufacturing, and plastics

23:54.616 --> 24:10.103
courses, which we got squenched down into one room 
for all those.

24:11.534 --> 24:23.264
Well, there is more, because the original dean 
that is original to me, well, the original dean

24:11.534 --> 24:23.264
fostered the crafts program, which had a lab here 
and a lab in the other building. And that program

24:23.284 --> 24:39.959
moved to environmental design

24:23.284 --> 24:39.959
somewhat more amicably than the educational 
technology

24:23.284 --> 24:39.959
movement. What was the dean's? attitude or what 
was their comparison or contrast between the

24:42.078 --> 24:50.449
attitude towards the department from the two 
administrations?

24:53.293 --> 24:53.854
I don't know. It seemed to me that

24:53.974 --> 25:02.725
both have at times indicated strong support.

25:04.948 --> 25:09.334
Probably neither has been able to demonstrate the 
level of commitment that one would like to see. I

25:11.727 --> 25:23.123
don't think anyone in the department has ever felt 
full-fledged support on a continuing basis,

25:11.727 --> 25:23.123
which is a major concern, I think. So that's asking 
the impossible of an administration, but that's

25:23.143 --> 25:28.170
what people would like to have. Continuous 
commitment. Yeah, continuous commitment. And we

25:33.498 --> 25:36.402
have not been newsmakers. Teaching people how to 
earn a living or teaching people how to teach

25:37.276 --> 25:43.223
people how to earn a living is not very glamorous. 
It doesn't match up with math and science. But a

25:46.947 --> 25:51.713
whole lot more people have to learn to do it. And in 
terms of the social value of our field, I think

25:51.733 --> 26:03.406
we've been basically unrecognized at the 
college. Now that you're out of the department, I

26:03.426 --> 26:06.490
don't know if you have any kind of a vision, or if you 
did beforehand, about where it's going. And I know

26:11.016 --> 26:16.484
there's new laws and all these are going to affect 
that department as well as all of the others. Do you

26:16.965 --> 26:21.251
have a little crystal ball, or did you, about where 
you think these things are going? Well, I did have,

26:21.331 --> 26:24.256
and it's been surprised quite a bit lately. It has 
been what? My crystal ball has been surprised

26:26.359 --> 26:29.003
lately.

26:32.448 --> 26:34.030
I really feel that The department right now is in a 
very ambiguous situation. And it's difficult for

26:38.459 --> 26:51.214
me to be really objective since I'm only a few 
months away from it, and since I still have an

26:38.459 --> 26:51.214
appointment in it, but since I don't have any real 
influence in it. And I refuse to try to influence in

26:51.234 --> 26:58.762
the filibustering sense or in the political way. 
But it's a very uncomfortable time. for the

27:04.857 --> 27:20.275
faculty, and

27:04.857 --> 27:20.275
the group really needs to be able to work its value

27:04.857 --> 27:20.275
with a better sense of purpose than it has. It's 
being asked again to clarify its mission, and...

27:28.926 --> 27:30.608
But again, what do you mean? Has it been asked to do 
this? Well, we spent a good share of last year in a

27:31.309 --> 27:34.172
self-study, Which, well, I'm being very frank 
with you there. I really

27:41.918 --> 27:57.321
hope you'll be. True. Okay. And people are so 
concerned.

28:06.299 --> 28:07.301
What is, what are you? Center for Career 
Development, is the way that's called. But yours

28:10.125 --> 28:11.748
is, oh, I see. Why, why did they name that? Well, it 
was named that during the era when career

28:15.674 --> 28:33.842
education was a big thing, and Chris Warman was 
doing a bunch of career everything, and, and

28:15.674 --> 28:33.842
Hubert put together the name and named it, and it 
didn't, the name didn't go away, but we've not been

28:15.674 --> 28:33.842
able to find anyone who wants to fund anything I 
think we would have been better off to have said,

28:34.615 --> 28:41.802
you know, cancel that name because the name is such 
a handicap. But you're catching me on an actual

28:41.982 --> 28:45.465
rock and a block. That's okay. I need that. I should 
get into town before 2.30 then. That's right.

28:52.071 --> 28:53.092
Before you're going to do an interview. Okay. You 
said the last thing you said was that you had spent a

28:54.013 --> 28:58.637
great deal of last year in a self-study. Yes. Okay. 
And What were you pleased with the results, or did

29:02.307 --> 29:05.931
the results indicate? This is a really awkward

29:06.372 --> 29:13.019
thing. Because our faculty really felt, I'm 
interpreting faculty, but the dean just insisted

29:14.641 --> 29:26.334
that we bring in some outside consultants and do a 
self study. Then he intervened a couple of times,

29:26.354 --> 29:31.420
and that generated some resistance. And at about 
the time the faculty senate asked their

29:31.973 --> 29:46.411
recommendation that department head tenure 
should be limited to 10 years, some faculty

29:31.973 --> 29:46.411
members stopped participating in the search for 
consensus. Now it appears that we're being asked

29:46.811 --> 29:53.880
again what to do. what to recommend to the dean with 
regard to programs, departmental emphasis. And

29:59.683 --> 30:03.728
as I said before, we don't have a cohesive group. 
We've got a group of individual specialists, each

30:04.208 --> 30:08.193
in their own area. It's as if you had one reading 
person, one science person, one social studies

30:08.993 --> 30:15.561
person. And you say, now what are we all ought to be 
doing? And one says we ought to be doing reading,

30:20.017 --> 30:26.365
and another says we ought to be doing math, and 
another says we ought to be doing science, and

30:20.017 --> 30:26.365
another says we ought to be doing social studies. 
Now, this faculty senate thing, is that something

30:26.385 --> 30:31.992
new about a 10-year department head limit? Yes. I 
hadn't heard that one. That came into effect last

30:35.737 --> 30:42.285
year, as I was in my 10th year, more than halfway 
through it. OK. I hadn't heard about that one. I

30:47.033 --> 30:49.256
don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I was 
at a very awkward spot in my own career. And it

30:54.602 --> 31:03.834
absolutely destroyed my ability to lead the 
group, if the group was leadable. But things have

31:03.854 --> 31:14.948
really, departmental consensus has really 
degenerated since that time, as I perceive it. I

31:15.704 --> 31:26.160
think that the department has got to feel some 
security and support, and it doesn't appear to me

31:15.704 --> 31:26.160
likely that that will occur under an interim head. 
There's no search for a clear statement that there

31:26.180 --> 31:29.385
will be one. So it's a real uncomfortable time 
right now for people.
