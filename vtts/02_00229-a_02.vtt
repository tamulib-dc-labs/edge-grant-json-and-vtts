WEBVTT

00:01.297 --> 00:03.299
Take a look at all of them.

00:03.339 --> 00:05.441
It's tossed away and makes us sick.

00:05.501 --> 00:06.963
Restaurants too.

00:07.023 --> 00:08.824
And then so many hungry people.

00:08.844 --> 00:16.091
But anyway, so Christmas then was a big celebration for the family and it was a big family and a social event.

00:16.592 --> 00:16.832
Yes.

00:16.972 --> 00:19.695
There were several during the course of the year.

00:19.775 --> 00:23.018
Thanksgiving was always big.

00:23.038 --> 00:28.764
The whole, not only our own family, but generally we would meet at grandfather's.

00:28.784 --> 00:30.966
And there you would have the turkey or chicken.

00:31.553 --> 00:49.479
all of the dressings and everything that went with it, all of the grandchildren from the three branches because Uncle Oscar never married, so it'd be Ned and my aunt Clara, her family and our family.

00:52.243 --> 00:55.047
Also on such occasions

00:55.347 --> 00:57.349
Three times a year, I think, he used to do this.

00:57.489 --> 01:00.192
Grandfather was a firm believer in silver.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.613
He didn't like the paper money.

01:02.014 --> 01:03.014
Oh, he didn't?

01:03.035 --> 01:16.027
And so at the Christmas, or at the Thanksgiving dinner, and also at Christmas, and Fourth of July, each grandchild got a big silver dollar.

01:17.389 --> 01:22.013
Might get something else, but always a silver dollar from grandfather.

01:23.005 --> 01:24.927
He didn't believe in that paper stuff.

01:24.947 --> 01:26.168
No, no.

01:26.189 --> 01:31.274
No confidence in them.

01:32.315 --> 01:36.780
So those were the three big ones, Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Fourth of July.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.541
Fourth of July.

01:38.742 --> 01:39.463
Why not Easter?

01:39.844 --> 01:47.152
Well, at the church this was big, but it didn't get to be a family reunion of the same thing.

01:47.512 --> 01:51.156
Always at church and generally

01:52.317 --> 01:56.622
there were, it was an important event for obvious reasons.

01:56.642 --> 02:01.828
Well, it's interesting that two of these are national holidays and one's a religious holiday.

02:01.848 --> 02:06.093
I suppose this was grandfathered in part.

02:06.113 --> 02:08.596
I don't know how it came about, but that was the custom.

02:11.259 --> 02:18.768
Did you consider your grandfather or your parents patriotic people?

02:19.229 --> 02:22.172
Yes, both grandparents and

02:23.468 --> 02:24.990
Do you have any examples?

02:26.412 --> 02:28.995
Can you ever think back?

02:29.135 --> 02:31.018
Well, for example, they always voted.

02:31.458 --> 02:32.239
This is one thing.

02:32.660 --> 02:38.347
Even with the problems of getting to the voting place in those times, this was difficult to do.

02:38.367 --> 02:46.357
They used to take it upon themselves to vote.

02:46.377 --> 02:51.484
Now, they didn't seem to be that directly involved

02:52.409 --> 02:56.855
Although I don't remember too much about this in the local school elections.

02:56.915 --> 03:01.261
You know, you used to have a school board.

03:01.281 --> 03:05.326
They were interested, but I don't remember specifically that they were involved.

03:08.150 --> 03:11.274
Your father didn't go into World War I, did he?

03:11.294 --> 03:13.337
He was probably too old for that.

03:13.497 --> 03:21.348
No, he didn't go into World War I. Your grandfather was probably too old for a Spanish-American one.

03:21.368 --> 03:21.488
Right.

03:22.025 --> 03:37.846
My grandfather would have been, let's see, in World War I. He would have been 31 or somewhere.

03:37.866 --> 03:38.466
Yeah, that's too old.

03:40.549 --> 03:41.731
Another issue, of course.

03:41.751 --> 03:49.821
One of my uncles was involved, the husband-to-be of my aunt, the Clara Bordo.

03:50.729 --> 03:54.313
Another issue right around this time was, of course, immigration restriction.

03:55.054 --> 04:04.925
And a number of farmers were quite eager for immigration restriction to keep, you know, aliens from buying land.

04:04.945 --> 04:05.966
We never heard her.

04:05.986 --> 04:08.289
I don't remember anything about this.

04:08.309 --> 04:09.230
Oh, good.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.273
No, I never heard anything about this.

04:12.714 --> 04:16.418
So that wasn't a good concern to them as far as they are concerned?

04:16.438 --> 04:16.658
No.

04:16.778 --> 04:20.162
I think it might be interesting to show

04:20.463 --> 04:26.571
a traditional Thai even that late, and the second would have been the third generation.

04:26.591 --> 04:49.339
During summer, at least two summers that I remember, maybe three, in the rural country school, there would be six weeks or eight weeks of Norwegian school, where some young seminary student would come and give Norwegian

04:49.724 --> 05:01.278
And in this little Lutheran church, from my earliest recollection, there were always two sermons.

05:02.659 --> 05:08.166
The first one was in Norwegian, and the second one was in English.

05:09.968 --> 05:19.039
Then, as the elderly passed on, by the time I was probably 12 or 13, it was the other way around.

05:19.897 --> 05:29.288
The first sermon was in English, and the second was a short one in Norwegian for the few elderly who were still there.

05:30.309 --> 05:38.158
All of them spoke English, but they were more, they were obviously more comfortable in Norwegian.

05:38.178 --> 05:46.528
That's really interesting because my parents are on my mother's side, who are from Germany,

05:47.082 --> 05:54.651
And right around the time of World War I, they outlawed speaking German in the house.

05:55.492 --> 05:57.494
I mean, they just wanted to become American.

05:57.534 --> 06:11.150
So it's interesting that the Norwegians wanted to continue with their language, while a number of German, and they were second generation, wanted to drop it as fast as possible to prove that they were Americans.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.774
See, I was the third generation, and I still caught the tail end of that.

06:15.655 --> 06:15.975
Sure.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.798
I didn't learn Norwegian.

06:19.878 --> 06:24.885
My grandfather used to speak to me, and I could understand perfectly well then in listening to the sermons.

06:25.546 --> 06:29.511
But once I left for college, I forgot it all, unfortunately.

06:29.531 --> 06:35.800
My grandfather always used to say, someday you'll regret that you never worked hard enough to make it a part of you.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.403
He was a pretty visionary guy in this sense.

06:40.226 --> 06:42.829
Kind of unusual.

06:43.430 --> 06:44.832
You might be interested that...

06:45.773 --> 06:56.104
in this rural school, there were two different groups that came to this school.

06:56.124 --> 07:02.611
The Norwegian community was bounded on the east by Bohemian community.

07:02.711 --> 07:04.413
They came from the province of Bohemia.

07:04.513 --> 07:05.934
They didn't like to be called Czechs.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.977
They were proud to be called Bohemians.

07:10.679 --> 07:13.282
And many of those children would arrive.

07:13.442 --> 07:14.363
I think they came

07:14.748 --> 07:16.189
one generation later.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.334
When they would arrive at country school, they couldn't speak any English.

07:22.215 --> 07:23.316
They picked it up pretty fast.

07:23.336 --> 07:23.857
Just German?

07:24.818 --> 07:25.598
Just Bohemian.

07:26.159 --> 07:26.499
Really?

07:26.879 --> 07:28.521
Which is a dialect in German?

07:28.621 --> 07:29.342
I expect it is.

07:29.802 --> 07:31.984
Between German and Czech?

07:32.004 --> 07:35.628
I think it's closer to Czech.

07:36.228 --> 07:36.989
Yeah, it's Czech.

07:37.309 --> 07:42.274
And as a result, when I was young also, I knew quite a few Czech words.

07:45.157 --> 07:56.151
And the village, not a railroad town, but the one of several hundred, maybe a thousand, only about six miles from there was Protivan.

07:56.171 --> 08:05.523
And then another five miles beyond, in the center of a more bohemian Czechoslovak community, was Spilville.

08:05.543 --> 08:14.134
And that was where the Vashak spent one summer when he was director, when he was with the New York Symphony, where he wrote part of the New World Symphony.

08:14.603 --> 08:26.934
in that little village of Spilwell, which was only about 11 miles from home, but in the Bohemian or Czech community.

08:26.954 --> 08:40.647
I was wondering if you ever remember or ever remember your father telling you about conflict between the different nationalities in this very ethnic America back at the turn of the century.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.429
It was even...

08:43.848 --> 08:45.110
during my generation.

08:46.893 --> 08:54.284
There was no conflict except when it came to cross marriages between Catholicism and Lutheranism.

08:55.706 --> 08:57.749
Then you used to see it.

08:59.412 --> 09:04.179
Now of course this is passed from being pretty largely, but it was still pretty strong.

09:05.461 --> 09:09.167
We used to associate all the time.

09:09.287 --> 09:09.788
I learned to

09:10.477 --> 09:27.465
dance the polka and learn to dance over in those Bohemian communities, and then spill them, and we all used to go to these, both communities, both the Norwegian and the Czechs.

09:27.825 --> 09:31.151
I suppose that there were Norwegian and Czech jokes, weren't there?

09:31.171 --> 09:31.431
Oh, yes.

09:33.474 --> 09:37.441
Just like today, I've been reading those Minnesota and Iowa jokes.

09:37.481 --> 09:37.581
Yeah.

09:43.248 --> 09:48.656
Socializing, though, with the other nationalities, the only problem was the religion.

09:49.477 --> 09:49.998
The marriage.

09:50.279 --> 09:51.320
Not even the religion.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.966
They could talk and even talk about religion.

09:55.006 --> 10:06.263
There didn't seem to be any conflict there, but when it come to intermarriage, it was still there.

10:06.283 --> 10:07.465
Did you ever see it?

10:07.485 --> 10:08.867
Did you see any of this?

10:09.438 --> 10:11.120
No, because I lived in Minneapolis.

10:11.581 --> 10:12.962
Yeah, well you wouldn't see it.

10:13.243 --> 10:17.168
You don't see it after.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.751
Were there very many marriages then, or very few?

10:19.891 --> 10:20.532
Probably very few.

10:20.552 --> 10:21.052
Very few.

10:21.954 --> 10:22.494
Very few.

10:25.758 --> 10:31.125
I suppose I, I don't know, maybe I had one or two cousins.

10:31.645 --> 10:36.751
of mine that intermarried with Catholics.

10:37.532 --> 10:43.259
Maybe there were more, but that's the ones I remember.

10:43.439 --> 10:50.127
Let's go back and talk a little bit about the character of your father again.

10:50.148 --> 10:57.657
You said that he was a disciplinarian and that he liked order, and he also was very responsible.

10:58.718 --> 11:00.420
Were there other attributes that he had?

11:00.518 --> 11:03.642
When I say he was a disciplinarian, never with a loud voice.

11:03.742 --> 11:07.027
You just respected what he said.

11:07.047 --> 11:15.378
He wasn't the type of disciplinarian that had to physically punish his children.

11:15.979 --> 11:20.705
I never remembered having my father or mother, either one, put a hand on me.

11:20.725 --> 11:25.011
I'm sure that I got slapped sometime when I was young, but I don't remember.

11:25.031 --> 11:28.656
Or for that matter, my grandfather.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.458
I don't remember any of them.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.545
doing this.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.408
So the type of punishment was a reason.

11:37.912 --> 11:50.128
And if you got into trouble, I seldom did, but in country school you had your parents stuff deal with which was probably worse.

11:51.370 --> 11:59.280
For example, I used to run a trap line before school, skunk, muskrat, mink.

11:59.935 --> 12:00.736
make a lot of money.

12:01.897 --> 12:07.022
I remember two days in a row I got sent home from school.

12:07.162 --> 12:10.245
I'd wash up when I come back, skunk.

12:12.007 --> 12:18.954
I thought I got myself all cleaned off and go to school and the room started getting warm.

12:18.994 --> 12:20.736
You know it's hard to get that stuff off.

12:21.076 --> 12:22.758
Then I got sent home.

12:23.579 --> 12:25.381
The first day dad didn't say much.

12:25.401 --> 12:27.563
The second day he said, look Norman,

12:28.538 --> 12:30.020
You're going to have to do one or the other.

12:30.841 --> 12:37.632
You're going to have to go to school or quit trapping or quit trapping for skunk.

12:40.696 --> 12:42.559
I guess I didn't catch any more skunk that year.

12:42.599 --> 12:43.020
I don't know.

12:43.080 --> 12:50.271
Maybe my luck ran out, or maybe I didn't catch the harvest of the skunk's glands.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.200
One other thing that I remember a little later

12:56.467 --> 12:58.691
I think gives the spirit of the community.

13:00.754 --> 13:08.045
The summer threshing or harvesting crews, not just threshing, especially the threshing.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.870
You know at that time we had binders.

13:13.574 --> 13:15.838
Ours was mostly oats, not wheat.

13:16.839 --> 13:21.867
It was oats sown to red clover.

13:22.420 --> 13:28.008
then after a year of hay and red clover go to corn and then back.

13:28.028 --> 13:31.333
And oats was the small grain crop.

13:31.353 --> 13:35.359
We used to, of course, run the binders and then shock it.

13:36.340 --> 13:42.930
Then the thrashing machine owned by one person who would do the thrashing for the whole community.

13:43.771 --> 13:51.162
And the crew would be eight teams and

13:52.660 --> 14:01.230
bundle wagons and the people to handle the horses, and two or three extra people to load them up a little faster from the field.

14:01.250 --> 14:13.284
The person that ran the separator, the thrashing machine, and one on the steam engine, and then one who handled the water for the steam engine, water monkey, we used to call him.

14:13.304 --> 14:21.233
And a fourth one, one who ran the elevator to take the grain to the, or to the grainery and get it into the bins.

14:22.242 --> 14:26.127
And this was a social event, one of the big social events of the whole community.

14:27.108 --> 14:29.772
You go from one farm to the next.

14:30.893 --> 14:31.914
And how long did it take?

14:32.475 --> 14:33.957
A couple weeks usually?

14:33.997 --> 14:39.244
Probably closer to three weeks or a month, depending on the weather, of course.

14:39.264 --> 14:41.126
Three weeks, I would say.

14:41.146 --> 14:44.150
And as you would move, of course, these were long days.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.554
And the women were involved also.

14:48.175 --> 14:51.439
It used to be kind of a competition to see who could put up the best food.

14:52.938 --> 14:58.663
two or three kinds of meat and all kinds of vegetables and two or three kinds of pies.

14:59.184 --> 15:09.733
The only sad part of it was this was for noon, and once you eat all of this good food, it was miserable to go out there in the heat and start working again.

15:10.934 --> 15:14.358
When you want to take a nap.

15:14.378 --> 15:14.498
Right.

15:14.518 --> 15:18.601
But it was a good cohesive force to keep the community together.

15:19.302 --> 15:20.363
Once that disappeared,

15:21.946 --> 15:25.852
and the individual farm combines came into being.

15:25.872 --> 15:28.897
You lost a lot of that community spirit.

15:31.641 --> 15:34.686
We used to have- The technology and the impact on society.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.008
Right.

15:36.148 --> 15:48.207
We saw some of the same early in filling silo, where a number of neighbors would buy one silage cutter and exchange work in order to

15:49.823 --> 15:52.907
telescope the time to fill that silo in a day or a day and a half.

15:54.569 --> 15:56.551
And then you would move from one farm to the next.

15:56.851 --> 16:06.603
But it was never quite the same as the thrashing operation which involved more farmers because you had to have bigger crew.

16:06.623 --> 16:13.972
And by the time the silo filling came along, there was more machinery also.

16:14.012 --> 16:15.814
It wasn't

16:16.165 --> 16:19.109
There weren't the same number of farmers involved.

16:19.129 --> 16:22.074
Did the women ever get out in the fields of the mountains?

16:22.094 --> 16:23.576
Some of them.

16:24.397 --> 16:25.219
Who were they?

16:25.599 --> 16:27.221
Oh, one of my aunts was very good.

16:27.242 --> 16:32.389
She liked to be out there, drive tractors and whatnot, the early days of the tractor.

16:32.409 --> 16:45.008
And quite a few of the, not too many, but of my father's generation, there were always a few who liked to be out in the field.

16:45.511 --> 16:46.873
driving tractors, sometimes.

16:47.453 --> 16:50.437
Why do men think of these women?

16:50.457 --> 16:51.579
Never heard much criticism.

16:51.799 --> 16:54.102
They thought it was too hard for the woman physically.

16:55.584 --> 16:58.487
But there were those free spirits at that time too.

16:59.168 --> 17:06.538
And one aunt, one of my favorite aunts, she was out there, she just passed away about two or three years ago.

17:08.080 --> 17:12.085
He was always very active.

17:12.105 --> 17:14.708
And the other ones that would stay in,

17:15.127 --> 17:16.849
And prepare the meals.

17:16.870 --> 17:21.737
Prepare the meals, and during the threshing time, they would bring up the cattle.

17:22.237 --> 17:24.901
Oh, sure, they used to have to handle all of the washing.

17:25.582 --> 17:41.805
Going back to my grandmother's generation when I was still under the grand parental rule, I remember how all of that used to go, the washing, and every day, filling with all the kerosene lamps.

17:42.306 --> 17:43.648
I used to help my grandmother.

17:44.236 --> 17:47.639
certain time in the afternoon after school.

17:47.699 --> 18:02.394
You'd get all of the lamps, whatever they were, eight or ten of them, take them out on the back porch, trim off the wicks, clean up the, take the soot out of the inside of the chimneys, glass chimneys, fill them with kerosene, put them back in their proper places.

18:03.355 --> 18:13.284
In the spring of the year, of course, in butchering time, smoked the meat, especially the ham.

18:13.304 --> 18:14.125
Then we used to

18:14.527 --> 18:17.590
She always used to make the soap, save all the fat.

18:19.392 --> 18:33.507
From the winter and in the spring of the year, cook this all in a big steel kettle, melt this, make it into laundry soap.

18:33.527 --> 18:36.890
Canning season was fascinating to me.

18:37.050 --> 18:44.398
You used to grow your own garden stuff, everything from strawberries and peas.

18:44.733 --> 18:54.425
beans, a whole gamut of things, cold pack, you know, cut them up, put them into mason jars, glass jars, and the salt or whatever you put with it.

18:54.445 --> 18:57.248
Put them into big boilers with the rubber.

18:59.010 --> 19:10.864
And get them up to the temperature to sterilize them and then turn the thing down, tip them up to make sure it wasn't leaking.

19:11.805 --> 19:13.187
That was the standard procedure.

19:13.623 --> 19:15.365
I remember- We still do that.

19:15.385 --> 19:22.874
Sure, and I remember, especially in corn, at a certain time of the year we didn't have sweet corn at that time, it was just field corn.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.156
Yeah.

19:24.216 --> 19:40.035
Dad would say, come on, it's time to go out there and we'd go out in the field and pick off two or three sacks of corn and come in and everybody would be cutting it off the ears, cold pack, the same way on meat because we didn't have any refrigeration.

19:41.787 --> 19:45.312
There's no refrigeration out in those little farms, no electric light.

19:45.332 --> 19:46.654
Right, right.

19:46.694 --> 19:51.681
Well, we're going to get to all the technological advances, but I wanted to move back for a minute.

19:51.701 --> 19:52.662
I want to talk about your mother.

19:52.682 --> 19:57.249
We talked about the character of your father, but we really haven't thought much about her.

19:57.269 --> 19:58.891
We said that she went to eighth grade.

19:59.992 --> 20:00.673
Yeah.

20:00.693 --> 20:02.155
And did she have any other education?

20:03.357 --> 20:08.284
Somewhere along the line she took, and I don't remember where, she was a pretty good seamstress.

20:08.602 --> 20:10.004
She did all the sewing.

20:10.064 --> 20:15.672
She was beautiful seamstress for my two sisters, my sisters especially.

20:15.812 --> 20:19.337
She used to make all her clothes and a lot of her own clothes, and she was very good at it.

20:20.118 --> 20:34.118
And somewhere along the way, she went to whatever it was called, dressmakers school of some kind in Decorah, I guess, which is the little town where Luther College is.

20:36.181 --> 20:37.883
So she was very good at this.

20:39.550 --> 20:40.511
and liked to do it.

20:44.376 --> 20:52.647
Very soft-spoke, very kind, always concerned also whether you're getting along or right.

20:52.907 --> 20:56.131
Even after I'd gone to the university, she'd always worry.

21:01.338 --> 21:06.344
So in that respect, she was, I think, quite sensitive.

21:06.364 --> 21:07.405
Was she very religious?

21:08.407 --> 21:08.747
Yes.

21:09.200 --> 21:16.046
Both of them lived on, my father died in 1972.

21:16.147 --> 21:26.396
When I, unfortunately, about a year before I got the Nobel award, he lost his mental capacities.

21:26.776 --> 21:33.162
And when he found out about it, and he was blind also, he had glaucoma.

21:33.182 --> 21:39.088
He lost one, he lost the sight on one eye when he was 36, before anything much was known about glaucoma.

21:40.030 --> 21:50.566
And then he had had tremendous trouble with stomach ulcers from among my earliest recollections.

21:52.749 --> 21:57.155
He nearly bled to that from hemorrhage when I was probably five or six years old.

21:57.876 --> 21:59.799
And the doctor told him he'd have to quit smoking.

21:59.919 --> 22:03.965
So he quit, whatever it was, 18 or 20 years.

22:04.606 --> 22:06.950
He never started again.

22:06.970 --> 22:08.552
But he would have troubles.

22:09.393 --> 22:19.227
with stomach ulcers periodically, sometimes bleeding ulcers, and once after I was in Mexico, he was having more and more of this kind of trouble.

22:19.808 --> 22:33.327
I took him to Mayo Clinic and went through and they decided that there had to be something real bad in there and they wanted to, and so they operated.

22:33.347 --> 22:38.674
They found that sometime way back,

22:39.481 --> 22:49.916
40 years before, he'd had one of those bleeding ulcers, and apparently part of the intestine had grown right onto the wall of the body cavity.

22:50.017 --> 22:53.882
So when he'd lift, he'd pull that thing loose.

22:54.283 --> 22:55.845
So that was the explanation.

22:56.767 --> 23:01.674
So they operated, and he never had any more trouble with this.

23:01.694 --> 23:08.644
But at the same time, when he went in, I said, look, better examine those eyes also, because he had lost the sight.

23:08.962 --> 23:11.405
and he had glaucoma on this one.

23:11.425 --> 23:14.009
The other eye was still fairly good.

23:14.029 --> 23:28.287
They kept quite a bit of that vision for a long time, but Dad, as I told you, liked to read, but little by little he was losing this.

23:28.447 --> 23:36.758
And I should have said that my mother couldn't walk for about the last

23:38.375 --> 24:06.795
20 years of her life because of arthritis her hands and her knees and her feet were all miserably just miserable from that standpoint and she tried to keep house the best she could my dad had to do most of it most of the land they rented out by them but dad preferred to live on the farm which I think was right for her because it was home and he did most of the work and then he had a little stroke and

24:07.197 --> 24:12.542
So I arranged that they could move into the Evans home, which is one of the prides of this little town of Cresco.

24:12.903 --> 24:19.449
It's money that was left by one of the rather wealthy people to establish this home for the elderly.

24:20.069 --> 24:27.597
It looks like a motel rather than an elderly home with good service and care.

24:28.458 --> 24:29.959
And so they both moved in there.

24:30.860 --> 24:36.225
And probably, I don't remember the year, but maybe

24:38.433 --> 24:43.939
in 65, 64, somewhere in there.

24:43.959 --> 25:02.978
And when the Nobel award came, and Father was alert, and I think one thing that led to his problem was that when he couldn't read anymore, I think that sort of left him lots of frustration.

25:03.378 --> 25:08.423
And then he lost his, just a year before

25:08.977 --> 25:12.561
the Nobel award, he lost his mental capacity.

25:13.382 --> 25:16.386
I remember when I came up there, there was a big hullabaloo.

25:16.406 --> 25:20.290
My mother was invalid, but she was mentally right up to the day she died.

25:20.571 --> 25:22.833
She was very alert mentally.

25:24.055 --> 25:32.945
And my father said, Norman, I understand there's something big going on around here, but I don't understand it.

25:32.985 --> 25:37.330
And that's as close as I could ever get to making him understand.

25:38.660 --> 25:39.281
Did your mother?

25:39.301 --> 25:46.913
Oh, yes, she was tremendously satisfied and happy.

25:47.835 --> 25:49.437
My father died about a year later.

25:49.758 --> 25:52.542
Did you take them more for the presentation?

25:53.263 --> 25:55.327
No, they were neither able to go.

25:55.367 --> 26:05.443
I took my two sisters and this is my wife and my son and daughter.

26:10.402 --> 26:22.836
I was wondering about... And as you know, the Peace Prize is given the same hour as the rest of the prizes, and it's in Oslo while the others are in Stockholm.

26:23.757 --> 26:24.718
I suppose you knew that.

26:25.078 --> 26:26.059
Most people don't you.

26:26.079 --> 26:28.081
No, I didn't know that.

26:28.101 --> 26:30.304
It's got an interesting background.

26:30.324 --> 26:39.514
You know, during the time when Alfred Nobel was writing his will, Norway, the foreign policy of Norway was still controlled by

26:40.169 --> 26:41.771
Swedish government.

26:41.791 --> 27:08.016
They had their own parliament, they had everything else except foreign policy was controlled by Stockholm and apparently Alfred Nobel wasn't in agreement on this and he thought that there was Norwegian's complaint had some merit and in his testimony

27:08.367 --> 27:23.322
I don't know when it changed, but in his will, he said he indicated the committees that would select everything from literature to the Carolina Institute and medicine and so on in Sweden.

27:23.863 --> 27:38.037
But he said in the case of the Peace Prize, it will be selected by the Norwegian Institute, which will be of the Nobel Foundation, which will be composed of the five members of the starting of the Congress.

27:38.658 --> 27:48.730
and the director of the institute and one outsider of prominence in the society.

27:48.750 --> 27:57.260
And the result was that all of the awards are given at 10 o'clock on December 10th, the hour of death of Alfred Nobel.

27:58.281 --> 28:06.150
And so if you get the Peace Prize, it's given in the University of Oslo at the same time that all of the other awards are being given in Stockholm.

28:06.856 --> 28:09.579
So you never get a chance to see them.

28:09.599 --> 28:12.862
I didn't know that until I got there.

28:15.765 --> 28:28.177
Now, speaking of the Nobel Prize, you won the prize and you made some tremendous contributions to agriculture.

28:28.738 --> 28:36.846
I was wondering, concerning your parents, how do you think your parents are responsible for that?

28:38.716 --> 28:49.869
I think in a large part, both my parents and especially the rural community in which I grew up, the work ethic was certainly a part of it.

28:49.969 --> 29:08.149
One thing that I've insisted on in the training of thousands of young people is that there can be dignity in the sweat from the human brow and clean soil under the fingernails even when it's done

29:08.737 --> 29:25.578
by the toil of a scientist and this is a fundamental part of my basic upbringing and it's one of the greatest obstacles to improving the agriculture in many of the developing nations.

29:25.638 --> 29:37.933
There has been a great over sophistication that in many cases have come from foreign institutions whether they be

29:38.622 --> 29:55.083
American universities, Canadian, Australian, or Western European or Northern European, foreign students without a background in the soil, on the soil, in the developing nations today.

29:55.103 --> 29:59.309
That was people who grew up in the city who are now telling the farmer, is that what you mean?

29:59.789 --> 30:01.732
Yes, let me go back just a little bit.

30:03.174 --> 30:04.275
In our own time

30:04.795 --> 30:34.701
when our agriculture was developing its scientific technological base, and it's not so long ago, back in 1862 was when the land-grant colleges and universities was established, and then it didn't go very well, so 25 years later when the experiment stations were set up, it was precisely because nothing much was happening here, and that what was being taught to the sons and daughters from the land to make them better farmers and ranchers,

30:35.002 --> 30:51.640
wasn't very effective and so the Hatch Act was passed to establish the experiment stations and then gradually over time it started to produce some data but it didn't come into the jigsaw, pieces of the jigsaw didn't really fit together very rapidly.

30:52.141 --> 31:00.950
It wasn't until about the late 20s when the pieces were there for example in corn but then the economic depression came along and it was chaos.

31:01.571 --> 31:04.654
The banks went broke and the whole upheaval

31:05.073 --> 31:13.364
And so it lay latent, and it wasn't until World War II when the great demand for food brought all of these pieces together.

31:13.384 --> 31:23.657
And then I have a table here that shows that in the period from 1940 to 1980, in the U.S.

31:24.498 --> 31:26.541
the production of the

31:26.993 --> 31:44.540
Most important, food, feed, and fiber crops increased from 252 million metric tons to 610 million in that 40-year period with only an increase of 3% in cultivated area.

31:44.560 --> 31:53.254
This was all application of technology that had gradually been built up over those 80 years.

31:53.977 --> 31:56.881
the normal, the pieces, and then it was put together.

31:56.901 --> 31:57.682
About three times?

31:58.924 --> 32:01.147
And in some crops it was even more.

32:02.008 --> 32:03.009
Corn, corn.

32:03.109 --> 32:16.487
I've got the basic raw materials and I don't have a graph here but I'll give you, remind me, I'll give you a copy of the graph and then I'll give you one of what we did in Mexico and Pakistan.

32:16.928 --> 32:17.669
Oh great, great.

32:17.689 --> 32:19.952
Yeah I want all of this documentary information.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.013
Okay then

32:23.963 --> 32:28.609
This we accept now as the things that make American agriculture great.

32:29.330 --> 32:36.340
And the patterns of development in Western Europe and Sweden and those countries, the UK, pretty much the same.

32:37.161 --> 32:46.974
But many of the third world nations got left behind because they did not develop their science and technology early enough.

32:46.994 --> 32:48.776
And it's a kind of curious picture.

32:48.896 --> 32:53.042
I arrived at conclusions that are quite similar to

32:53.562 --> 32:54.824
that of Michael Novak.

32:54.924 --> 32:57.107
I don't know if you've ever read any of Michael Novak.

32:57.207 --> 33:04.637
He's an economist, philosopher, and a seminarian, a Catholic layman.

33:05.058 --> 33:06.520
Well, he's more than a layman.

33:06.540 --> 33:07.562
He studied in seminary.

33:07.602 --> 33:09.324
He was in Rome for a number of years.

33:10.466 --> 33:20.059
And he wrote a paper about, well, a book on capitalism,

33:21.052 --> 33:45.777
agrarian capitalism and its role in economic and rural development, or words to this effect, that's not the exact title, but one chapter of that is why Latin America is poor, and he points out, he's never lived in Latin America, and he, but it's curious how he and I come to some of the same conclusions, coming down entirely different roads.

33:47.158 --> 33:50.822
He says that at the time of the

33:51.832 --> 33:58.824
establishment colonization of the so-called English colonies and they weren't all English by any means.

33:59.786 --> 34:12.909
The New England ones were largely English but Pennsylvania was Dutch or New Amsterdam was Dutch and Pennsylvania was German and Delaware was Swedish and so it wasn't as pure as it would seem.

34:14.332 --> 34:16.776
And he says at that time

34:21.228 --> 34:25.112
The Latin American countries of today had all the advantage.

34:25.132 --> 34:37.644
The agriculture of the Aztecs, the Incas, and the Mayans were far advanced to anything that the tribes had where the New England colonies arrived.

34:37.664 --> 34:41.607
They knew more about mining and the use of metals.

34:42.168 --> 34:43.189
The climate was better.

34:43.209 --> 34:44.870
They didn't go through the miserable winters.

34:45.411 --> 34:47.573
They didn't have the miserable soils of New England.

34:48.076 --> 34:51.099
We didn't know how to correct the infertility at that time.

34:51.119 --> 35:03.732
Everything was wrong, except I say, here I said it in quite an indirect way, but I say Latin America was born 100 years too soon, 1500 rather than the 1600.

35:05.194 --> 35:09.478
At the time, the Spanish and Portuguese colonies were established.

35:09.859 --> 35:17.627
They superimposed a feudalistic system that was then not only prevalent in Iberia, but

35:18.248 --> 35:19.630
all through Europe.

35:19.650 --> 35:23.354
But in the next hundred years, that feudalistic system was cracking.

35:23.935 --> 35:27.259
Separation of state and church took place, the Reformation.

35:28.060 --> 35:36.771
And by the time the pilgrims and the subsequent colonies came, there was a school on one side and there was a church on the other.

35:37.192 --> 35:39.475
That doesn't mean they weren't good Christians.

35:40.076 --> 35:44.141
But that had a lot to do with who got the education.

35:44.521 --> 35:45.943
Education was for all.

35:46.362 --> 35:48.524
in what became the 13th colony.

35:50.005 --> 36:01.315
Whereas in Latin America, that fuelistic system prevailed and education was for the sons and daughters of the elite, the aristocracy, the big landowners, and it was dished out by the church.

36:02.236 --> 36:07.941
And to me, that is one of the issues in Latin America that has set back development.

36:09.462 --> 36:16.048
And even after independence from Spain, the church still prevailed on

36:16.653 --> 36:18.755
the educational front.

36:18.795 --> 36:25.302
Mexico was the first to break with this in the bloody revolution of 10 to 20 when they broke up all the big haciendas.

36:25.322 --> 36:33.450
And I should point out that in some states such as Puebla, the biggest landowner of all was the church.

36:34.231 --> 36:38.795
And they were also hand in glove with the landed aristocracy.

36:39.576 --> 36:40.917
And that delayed the whole thing.

36:41.558 --> 36:45.462
And then when you start with a population such as Mexico had at that time,

36:46.083 --> 36:52.169
of 18 million, most of them illiterate, and try to catch up.

36:54.592 --> 37:10.548
Then back about the time of Lincoln, Benito Juarez made a real effort to try to get the public school system going, even though this was before this revolution, before the church's grip of the church had been broken.

37:11.248 --> 37:14.031
But when he was out, the friends came in,

37:14.433 --> 37:16.416
And Maximilian took over.

37:16.776 --> 37:24.447
That perpetuated until he was out, and then dictatorship of Diaz was for 25 years that finally led to the blood.

37:25.248 --> 37:32.018
But once you start with that kind of a handicap and the lack of trained people, it's just a disaster to try to catch up.

37:33.039 --> 37:35.783
Now, let's put this in context.

37:36.202 --> 37:46.976
This morning I was giving this class that I'm teaching on international agriculture, a feeling about all of the obstacles to try to provoke change, to introduce a technology.

37:47.496 --> 37:49.739
First to find out what needs to be done.

37:50.260 --> 37:51.922
And it's not just the seed.

37:51.942 --> 37:53.844
It's got to be an integrated approach.

37:54.966 --> 37:59.491
First you've got to find out how to restore the fertility to the soil.

37:59.812 --> 38:02.375
And that depends on what kind of soil.

38:02.495 --> 38:04.137
And there are many kinds of soil.

38:04.157 --> 38:04.858
And which crop.

38:05.497 --> 38:12.905
And that's got to be done largely in plots on farmer's fields, some of it in the experiment station and in laboratory.

38:12.925 --> 38:24.978
Once you change that, the varieties that were grown there under the primitive conditions are no longer useful because they have been selected under these miserable soil conditions.

38:25.038 --> 38:27.741
They have no high yield potential.

38:27.761 --> 38:30.844
And if you fertilize them, they'll grow upright and they'll fall down.

38:30.965 --> 38:35.149
Or worse yet, the crop will grow densely because it's fertilized.

38:36.057 --> 38:41.283
And the diseases will come in and clean it out because they're all susceptible.

38:41.303 --> 38:48.853
Or if you fertilize, if you control, if you ignore the weeds like it used to be before, the weeds will take over the whole thing.

38:48.913 --> 38:50.675
You'll be worse off than you were before.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.258
You've got to move all of the pieces together.

38:53.599 --> 38:56.783
You've got to check this on hundreds of farms.

38:56.803 --> 39:04.512
Then you've got the further job of communicating what needs to be done with the political leaders

39:06.938 --> 39:13.046
Nowadays, with the economists that sit on the right hand of all the politicians.

39:13.066 --> 39:23.298
In my early days in Mexico, we didn't have economists, so you went directly to the minister of agriculture or to the president because it hadn't evolved that far.

39:23.318 --> 39:24.780
Today it's more difficult.

39:25.241 --> 39:36.895
They're sitting there, and I say it in Spanish, I say, tienes que manejar también los que sientan al lado del político que está cortando el queso y repartiendolo.

39:37.330 --> 39:42.597
You've got to deal with that guy that's sitting there cutting up the cheese and passing it out.

39:43.198 --> 39:45.642
Another level in the bureaucracy.

39:45.822 --> 39:46.483
Another level.

39:47.524 --> 39:55.696
And while you're doing all of this other, you've got to get a feel of how all of these pieces fit together, and you've got to know when to play.

39:55.997 --> 40:06.932
Keep a low profile until the crisis is right, and then say, if you do this, the chances are good that this and this and this is likely to happen.

40:07.385 --> 40:15.673
and it's generally when you're faced with a crisis on food, but before it becomes chaotic so that the whole government breaks down.

40:17.054 --> 40:22.760
That's been my experience in Mexico, in Pakistan, in India, in every place.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.621
In Argentina I could never move it.

40:25.142 --> 40:36.953
Now we're going to get it off the ground, even I think even with all the inflation, because there there was never hunger, but now the situation is so chaotic that I think that there's a good chance that

40:37.287 --> 40:38.608
can be put into operation.

40:39.950 --> 40:46.417
You see there's economic, social, and technological that all have to fit together.

40:46.437 --> 40:49.360
Some listening to this would say that you're quite a cynic.

40:50.101 --> 40:51.022
What would you say to them?

40:51.342 --> 40:54.286
No, I'm just a hard-headed realist.

40:55.006 --> 40:56.548
That's exactly what I thought you'd say.

40:56.748 --> 41:02.334
I've worked with this and I know that that's the way progress has been made all down through time.

41:03.576 --> 41:06.619
And I repeat that status quo

41:08.692 --> 41:14.157
comfortable compared to fear of the unknown.

41:14.998 --> 41:37.298
But since there is no status quo, it's a false philosophy, especially with the numbers of people we have in the world today, from a food standpoint alone, forgetting for the moment all of the other issues about housing and education and all of the other things you need for a decent life, looking strictly at food,

41:38.577 --> 42:05.665
status quo when we have 84 million more people each year and where there are hundreds of millions that are inadequately nourished at the present time just won't get the job done and you've got to be a hard-headed realist what can be done at any point in time and I've learned this from 40 years of experience in dealing knowing when to keep a low profile you move too fast

42:07.568 --> 42:11.673
and remember that there's no zero risk in the biological world.

42:12.715 --> 42:14.176
A lot of people forget this.

42:14.817 --> 42:26.653
In these emotional times of ours, like this snafu now on ethylenedidromide, that product has been used for 30 years on many different things.

42:27.514 --> 42:30.938
Life expectancy continues to go up.

42:30.958 --> 42:32.660
It's higher than it ever has been.

42:33.642 --> 42:35.584
Were this

42:36.712 --> 42:40.738
through all that's being put out in the front page now.

42:40.758 --> 42:48.689
Now there may be cases where there may have been damage done, but by and large it's overkill.

42:48.710 --> 42:50.793
And you can look at the other side of it.

42:50.813 --> 42:51.133
What's overkill?

42:51.153 --> 42:51.834
You mean the media's overkill?

42:51.854 --> 42:52.135
Yes.

42:52.255 --> 43:06.195
Okay, but I don't... But some scientists are contributing to making this, and it's hard to separate out how those emotions get into the picture because of special issue lobbying groups.

43:07.019 --> 43:11.785
who don't see the broad picture because you're weighing benefits against risk.

43:11.825 --> 43:13.087
You always are.

43:13.107 --> 43:13.968
Sure.

43:13.988 --> 43:22.318
Now, Alan, you the realist, I want to get back to your parents and why you're the type of person that you are today.

43:22.719 --> 43:27.145
And one of those things that we started this conversation on is work ethic.

43:27.625 --> 43:33.473
Was another one a development of a more of what you would consider a realistic view of life?

43:34.454 --> 43:35.355
I would say yes.

43:36.196 --> 43:44.226
And does that relate, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but does that relate to the fact that you grew up with the soil in your hands?

43:44.686 --> 43:45.848
Yes sir.

43:45.868 --> 43:48.431
Do you want to elaborate on that?

43:48.451 --> 44:01.326
When it comes from the standpoint of how I look at science and technology in agriculture, I stand on a pretty firm fitting soil that I grew up on.

44:01.897 --> 44:06.703
and I learned a lot about the practical application before I ever went to the university.

44:07.584 --> 44:30.132
Then I took a very broad background of experience and I went down a road that was a very improbable one, studied forestry and there I got a picture I got interested in reforestation and water, shed management, erosion control, wildlife, the whole gamut of things.

44:31.681 --> 44:39.170
I handled CCC, civilian conservation work crews, young people, during the worst of the Depression.

44:40.372 --> 44:54.349
WPA, Works Project, Progress Administration, elderly displaced people in public works relating to building roads and parks and managing forests and all of these sorts of things.

44:54.589 --> 44:58.414
And as a result, you get pretty broad understanding.

44:59.002 --> 45:03.122
Then I went back to graduate school, and there are two other people along the way.

45:03.777 --> 45:05.679
But we're going to get to those people, okay?

45:05.699 --> 45:06.219
Okay.

45:06.239 --> 45:09.222
We're going to get to your education, but I want to get back to your parents here.

45:09.663 --> 45:10.163
Okay.

45:10.263 --> 45:15.368
Because not every kid off the farm in Iowa became a Nobel Prize winner.

45:15.668 --> 45:18.791
Not everyone worked like you did.

45:19.752 --> 45:28.981
So it has to be not just the fact that you're from a farm community, it must be a lot more to deal with your upbringing, wouldn't you say so?

45:29.862 --> 45:33.025
Well, I'm sure it has a great deal to do with this.

45:33.393 --> 45:43.684
And along the way, Granddad also, and my father too, but my father used to speak in a much quieter tone.

45:45.226 --> 45:47.788
There always was the philosophy of doing your best.

45:49.590 --> 45:51.352
But my grandfather would say it bluntly.

45:52.173 --> 45:56.418
My father would say, well, do the best you can.

45:56.438 --> 46:03.265
And I got this brought home to me very strongly by my high school principal and wrestling coach, athletic coach.

46:03.987 --> 46:07.365
and then later we'll go into a university profession.
