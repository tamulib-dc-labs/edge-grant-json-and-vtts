WEBVTT

00:01.516 --> 00:06.423
If it was away, we'd try to get back before night 
come. And that was on a Sunday, too, that we done

00:06.584 --> 00:09.608
that. Now, when we were slaves, we couldn't do 
that, see? And if we got free, we didn't know

00:16.358 --> 00:18.341
nothing to do. And my mother, she hunted places and 
bound us out for a dollar a month. We stayed there

00:25.352 --> 00:27.675
maybe a couple of years. She'd come over and 
collect the money every month. And the dollar was

00:34.049 --> 00:39.758
worth more then than $10 is now.

00:40.379 --> 00:45.266
And the men used to work for $10 a month, $120 a year, 
used to hire that way. Now you can't get a man for $50

00:47.790 --> 00:51.776
a month. If you pay a man now $50 a month, he don't 
want to work for it. More like $50 a week nowadays.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.163
Well, that's just it exactly. They want $50 a week, 
and they ain't got no more now. And we had then, and

01:03.506 --> 01:07.311
we, no more money. But, of course, they bought more 
stuff and more property and all that. We didn't

01:10.416 --> 01:11.617
have no property. We didn't have no home. We had 
nowhere, nothing. We didn't have nothing. We just

01:15.743 --> 01:23.594
grew, like your cattle, we just turned out and get 
along the best you could. Nobody to look after, so

01:23.614 --> 01:25.236
well. We've been slaves all our lives. My mother 
was a slave. My sister was a slave. Father was a

01:30.072 --> 01:31.093
slave. Who was your father a slave for? He was a 
slave for Burnley. He belonged to Burnley. Didn't

01:37.760 --> 01:40.263
he belong to Thomas Jefferson at one time? He 
didn't belong to Thomas Jefferson. My

01:41.644 --> 01:43.006
grandfather belonged to Thomas Jefferson. Oh, 
your grandfather did. And my father belonged to

01:44.527 --> 01:49.212
Burnley. Burnley died during the war time. 
Because he was afraid he'd have to go to war. But

01:57.974 --> 02:03.440
now, in them days, you could hire a substitute to 
take your place. Well, he couldn't get a

02:04.341 --> 02:07.765
substitute to take his place, so he'd run away from 
home. And he took hold. And when he come back, the

02:09.988 --> 02:13.051
war was over, but he died. And then, if he had lived, 
it wouldn't have been no good. The Yankees just

02:18.938 --> 02:20.299
come along and... and just broke the mill open and 
rolled all the flour out in the river and broke the

02:20.903 --> 02:32.140
store open and sold all the meat out in the street 
and sold all the sugar out. And we'd boil it and we'd

02:32.160 --> 02:41.173
pick it up and carry it and give it to our middle 
missus and master, young master, and tell them

02:32.160 --> 02:41.173
we'd come to be. Well, I don't know how. I don't know 
how to tell you the truth. When I think of it today, I

02:45.720 --> 02:48.784
don't know how I'm living. None of the rest of them 
that I know of is living. I'm the oldest one that I

02:52.967 --> 02:54.830
know that's living. But still, I'm thankful to the 
Lord. Now, if my master wanted to send me,

03:00.798 --> 03:17.522
he never said you couldn't get a horse and ride and 
walk, give you a note. He'd be barefooted and cold.

03:22.550 --> 03:27.117
He wasn't no more than a dog some of them in them 
days. He wasn't treated as good as they treat dogs

03:27.137 --> 03:29.440
now. But still, I didn't like to talk with him 
because it makes people feel bad.

03:39.634 --> 03:41.516
I could say a whole lot I don't like to say. I won't 
say a whole lot no more. Do you remember much about

03:44.080 --> 03:45.602
the Civil War? No, I don't remember much about it. 
You were a little young then, I guess. I remember

03:49.833 --> 04:02.286
when the Yankees come along and took all the good 
horses and took all the, sold all the meat and flour

03:49.833 --> 04:02.286
and sugar and stuff out in the river and let it go 
down the river. And they know the people wouldn't

04:02.967 --> 04:06.191
have nothing to live on, but they done that. That's 
the reason why I don't like to talk about it.

04:10.916 --> 04:15.100
People, if you was cooking anything, eating that 
for yourself, And if they was hungry, they'd go and

04:15.738 --> 04:20.625
eat it all up and get nothing. They'd just come in 
and drink up all them milk. Just do as they please.

04:27.554 --> 04:32.020
Time to be passing by all night long, walking, 
mudding, raining. Oh, they had a cold time.

04:37.828 --> 04:38.749
Colored people is free. They ought to be awful 
thankful. And some of them are sorry they are free

04:41.392 --> 04:43.315
now. Some of them never would rather be slaves. 
Which would you rather be, Uncle Phil? Me? Which

04:50.304 --> 04:53.086
I'd rather be? You know what I'd rather do? If I 
thought, had any idea, that I'd ever be a slave

04:56.509 --> 05:08.740
again, I'd take a gun and just end it all right away. 
Because you're nothing but a dog. You're not a

05:14.497 --> 05:19.366
thing but a

05:14.497 --> 05:19.366
dog. Night never comes out. You have nothing to do. 
Time to cut tobacco.

05:27.800 --> 05:31.146
If they want you to cut all night long out in the 
field, you cut.

05:35.033 --> 05:37.497
And if they want you to hang all night long, you 
hang. Hang tobacco. It didn't matter about your

05:40.231 --> 05:45.376
ties, being tied, you're afraid to say you're 
tied. They just,

05:47.458 --> 05:53.604
well. When did you come to Baltimore? You know, you 
don't remember when Garfield died, do you? When

06:00.691 --> 06:01.832
they shot Garfield? No, I don't think he was born. I 
don't think so either. I don't remember what year

06:06.797 --> 06:09.580
that was myself now. But I knew you wasn't born. 
When I come to Baltimore that year, I don't

06:13.830 --> 06:18.274
remember what year it was now myself. But if I was 
laying in the bed, I could remember. But I don't

06:24.421 --> 06:30.668
remember now.

06:30.688 --> 06:33.370
But did you go to work for Mr. Shirley when you came 
to Baltimore? Oh, no, no. I worked for a man by the

06:36.193 --> 06:40.478
name of Reed when I first come to Baltimore. I used 
to come here to haul manure for him. All horses were

06:45.671 --> 06:46.933
here then. No electric cars, no cable cars, all 
horse cars. And I used to haul manure, go around to

06:54.942 --> 06:58.627
different stables. Everybody had horses for 
their use when I first come here. They had

07:04.193 --> 07:07.157
coachmen. Men driving around didn't have 
automobiles. They hadn't been there so long.

07:16.591 --> 07:19.814
And then they put on a cable car, what they called 
cable cars. Well, they run them for a little while,

07:20.435 --> 07:24.419
maybe a couple of three years or four years. Then 
somebody invented the electric car, and that

07:25.380 --> 07:29.384
first one on North Avenue. Well, they had it on a 
while, and they kept on inventing and inventing

07:30.905 --> 07:36.030
until They got them all, different kinds of cars, 
you

07:36.483 --> 07:43.670
know. There was horse cars. There wasn't no 
electric car at all. There wasn't no big cars like

07:50.577 --> 07:57.204
you got now, you

07:50.577 --> 07:57.204
know. I just can't, I just can't think of what year 
it was. But,

08:15.127 --> 08:22.356
You're

08:15.127 --> 08:22.356
not getting tired, are you, young friend? No, no, I 
ain't. I'm just sitting at home. It's like I'm

08:24.678 --> 08:28.383
sitting in the house.

08:36.092 --> 08:42.720
I was thinking about, oh, now you know how we served 
the Lord when I was a boy? We would go to somebody's

08:43.460 --> 08:52.629
house and, well, we didn't have no house like we've 
got now, you know. We had these, what they call, log

08:52.649 --> 08:54.471
cabins.

08:57.714 --> 09:01.458
And they have one old, maybe one old colored man 
would be there. Maybe he'd be as old as I am. And he'd

09:03.841 --> 09:04.922
be the preacher. Not as old as I am now. He'd be the 
preacher and we'd all sit down and listen to him

09:07.364 --> 09:12.049
talk about the Lord. Well, he'd say, well, I 
wonder,

09:13.193 --> 09:25.011
sometimes he'd say, I wonder if we'll ever be free. 
Well, some of them would say, well, we're going to

09:25.031 --> 09:30.338
ask the Lord to free us. So he'd say, well, we're 
going to sing. I wonder, shall I ever reach heaven?

09:37.870 --> 09:39.252
I wonder, shall I fly? And they would sing that for 
about an hour Then the next one would get up and say,

09:44.227 --> 09:47.030
let's sing a song. We're going to live on milk and 
honey. Way by and by. Oh, I can hear them singing

09:52.114 --> 09:58.100
now, but I can't repeat like I could in them days. 
But someday when I'm not hoarse, I could tell you. I

10:02.103 --> 10:04.085
could sing it for you, but I'm too hoarse now. And 
then he would sing.

10:11.031 --> 10:11.512
I'm going to. I'm going to.

10:19.968 --> 10:23.532
Sing around the order. Oh, I wish I could sing it for 
you. I'm going to sing around the order. I wish you

10:30.860 --> 10:31.982
could, too. Well, someday you come over here, and 
I'm not host. You get me to come up here, and I'll try

10:35.546 --> 10:39.010
to sing it for you. Okay, I'm going to do that. Now, I 
heard people here now sing about a rolled shirt and

10:41.893 --> 10:49.722
a roll. Well, that's old-time people. That's what 
the old people used to sing in old back days. The

10:55.147 --> 10:56.288
Roll Jordan Roll? Yeah, but they don't sing it like 
the old people used to sing it in them days. They

11:00.052 --> 11:05.578
sing it quite different now.

11:05.598 --> 11:13.167
There's another one they sing

11:05.598 --> 11:13.167
by and by when the morning comes. Well, they sing 
that different, too. But they're getting the old

11:16.010 --> 11:18.494
people's songs. I hear them come over the radio. I 
know them all just as good as they, but they sing

11:19.775 --> 11:22.719
them different. They have different names. Yes, 
well, they cut them all short and all they get. If

11:28.788 --> 11:38.642
I had my voice, I would sing this one for you so you'd 
go in that room, but I can't do it on account of my

11:28.788 --> 11:38.642
voice. But someday you come over here, you come and 
call me up and let me know how my voice is. Ever since

11:45.014 --> 11:49.121
I took that medicine from that doctor, it hurt my 
voice.

11:52.626 --> 11:55.130
Now there was a preacher in my house the other 
night. He lived right next door to me and he played

11:55.190 --> 11:57.714
it on the piano. And he played something and I sung 
it for him. And now he wants me to go down to his

12:01.841 --> 12:05.727
church next Sunday. I told him, I said, now, if I go 
down to your church, I'll not sing nothing.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.540
Because if I do, I'll get hoarse. I can't talk. But 
he said, Brother Hughes, I don't care whether you

12:14.162 --> 12:16.425
sing or not. I just want you to go down there and let 
the people see who you are. Let them see who the old

12:20.109 --> 12:22.211
people is. I said, well, I'll be glad to go down with 
him. So next Sunday, I'm going down to his church.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.722
Nothing happened. But if he sings something old, 
I...

12:37.297 --> 12:40.622
Just sing along.

12:41.283 --> 12:43.526
I feel the spirit now, but I can't. I got to keep 
quiet. Now, do you ever hear this fellow that comes

12:45.690 --> 12:48.634
over the radio? I think they call him Holmes. Comes 
over Sunday night about 12 o'clock on WFPR. No,

12:58.729 --> 13:00.151
I've never heard him or not. Well, you turn him on. 
He comes on the quarter after 11 on Sunday night.

13:08.448 --> 13:14.755
Well, you must have heard him because he says, you 
can't keep a good man down. So he makes so much

13:16.637 --> 13:19.900
noise, it looked like everybody ought to hear him. 
But now when that fellow comes around, I'm laying

13:19.920 --> 13:22.222
in the bed. Don't you know, I get just so, I got to be 
in that. Because it's all old time business. And

13:28.849 --> 13:31.032
somebody don't like it. They says, I don't like 
homes. I says, why? Oh, he says, it makes too much

13:34.475 --> 13:36.177
noise. I said, well, the Bible said make a noise 
over Jesus. Jesus said make a noise over me. So he

13:43.457 --> 13:45.379
makes a noise over me. And I does enjoy certainly 
show. Oh, he's, oh, everybody, he's got a big crowd

13:48.543 --> 13:54.309
and we just get so happy. I got to do that too. Boy, 
when you feel the grace of God, you got to jump up. I

14:01.577 --> 14:04.180
lay in bed, I got to get up. Help carry on. Then next 
morning I can't talk.

14:17.384 --> 14:27.443
And this is part two of AFS recording number 9,990, 
original LWL number 1,500, reel number three of

14:17.384 --> 14:27.443
three.

14:36.704 --> 14:43.693
The doctor gave me that medicine and just told me 
all

14:36.704 --> 14:43.693
this. I sure hope you come back again because I'd 
like to hear you sing. The old people used to say,

14:47.097 --> 14:51.082
wonder if I shall ever reach heaven or wonder shall 
I fly. I used to go singing. Well, sometimes I feel

14:54.987 --> 14:59.153
the spirit, you know. I might get to sing someday 
again someday.

15:07.518 --> 15:13.544
Do

15:07.518 --> 15:13.544
you go to church every Sunday, Uncle Finn? Don't go 
to church at all. I listen to the radio. Listen to it

15:18.148 --> 15:20.411
on the radio, huh? Because I tell you why I don't go 
to church.

15:25.916 --> 15:27.618
You'd rather not have this on? You'd rather not 
tell me or you'd rather not have this on when you

15:29.860 --> 15:32.462
tell me? It don't make a difference. I ain't going 
to say nothing wrong. I ain't going to say nothing

15:36.306 --> 15:37.187
wrong. This

15:37.454 --> 15:55.429
is the B-side of AFS recording number 9986, 
original LWO number 1559, reel two of three.
