WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:13.590
It's

00:01.930 --> 00:13.590
real hard to just strike out, you know, and say 
we're going to do this, and it's hard to explain, I

00:13.570 --> 00:23.050
think, to the average citizen how engineering 
research affects their lives until

00:23.030 --> 00:43.260
you try to do is put it in what

00:23.030 --> 00:43.260
it is we do, and now it has an impact.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.440
Isn't invent kind of targeted to the individual? 
Exactly. It doesn't matter where, you know,

00:48.607 --> 00:52.980
anybody, anywhere, you have an idea, and you send 
it in, and it will be reviewed, and the success

00:52.960 --> 01:01.120
ratio in selection is very small, because most 
things have been thought of before or have been

01:01.100 --> 01:07.130
done better already, but it gives you an 
opportunity to find out for no charge if there's a

01:07.110 --> 01:16.370
potential for something that will, we're 
primarily targeted at things that will create.

01:20.790 --> 01:29.380
More jobs, and it's going to enhance the 
productivity or the product line of businesses

01:20.790 --> 01:29.380
already in existence, and or create new 
businesses.

01:35.830 --> 01:41.570
What is, how

01:35.830 --> 01:41.570
does the Research Foundation entail? The

01:41.550 --> 01:55.220
Research Foundation is an entity that

01:41.550 --> 01:55.220
panels all of our federal companies.

01:59.060 --> 02:07.700
To give you an example of what they, how they 
function, we cannot, we could buy a boat or a

02:07.680 --> 02:08.083
vessel. We could buy a boat for environmental 
engineering to use, to do their research with, but

02:08.103 --> 02:13.580
we can't purchase the insurance. State entities 
can't buy the insurance. They just, well, if you

02:17.560 --> 02:21.960
try to insure all these buildings, you'd be able to 
build one building a year from their premiums, and

02:21.940 --> 02:27.320
so it's a good fiscal policy, except under certain 
circumstances, and so there is a need to have a

02:27.300 --> 02:33.660
vehicle that can do those kinds of things. So they 
serve special purpose needs, and in the past, they

02:33.640 --> 02:38.640
have also, they've been able to do a lot more than an 
awful lot of the proposal preparation and

02:38.620 --> 02:48.000
contract negotiations for various. And at one 
point, they were almost one of the cities. They've

02:59.800 --> 03:02.820
been fairly well separated since the late 70s, 
haven't they? As far as I know, they were, they were

03:02.800 --> 03:06.820
very distinct operations. They

03:06.800 --> 03:13.670
have probably grown more. A lot of the services, we 
are able to do

03:13.650 --> 03:28.500
easier, quicker, or better, or what we find, we 
have to justify to the researchers. That we're

03:29.720 --> 03:37.020
purchasing a service, you know, and we've got to 
make sure that the researcher gets his money's

03:37.000 --> 03:49.840
worth, and the university, you know, that we're, 
we're being cost-effective.

03:49.820 --> 03:57.670
During your short stint here, what has been the 
biggest topic? Oh, I think the fact that the whole,

03:57.650 --> 04:20.020
and that it was

03:57.650 --> 04:20.020
much more aggressively attuned to serving the 
staff. We found that so many people, you know, they

04:23.351 --> 04:28.810
were, you know, they were, you know, they weren't 
changeable because they don't know how to do it,

04:28.790 --> 04:33.490
and so many people, we, TEAS And we found that many 
people who didn't know that it existed, and that it

04:34.390 --> 04:42.840
could provide statewide service, might have been 
on the way to creating another entity that was a

04:50.920 --> 04:55.490
state agency to do exactly what we were chartered 
to do. And so, with that

04:55.470 --> 05:05.810
threat, or possibility in your area, and the 
institution itself, I think We realized that we

05:05.790 --> 05:11.810
really did exist and we did have a state charter. We 
were not just here to serve Texas A&M University or

05:11.790 --> 05:16.810
College Station. We were here to serve the state of 
Texas and we could do that here. This is a good place

05:21.790 --> 05:25.300
to do it. We just needed to be more open with the 
state and public officials in saying that we

05:31.500 --> 05:34.520
recognize our state charter. I think there has 
been national emphasis before. It has always been

05:40.660 --> 05:43.730
in securing contracts. We've always worked on a 
national basis as far as LAIS on meeting Air Force

05:47.710 --> 05:54.560
and DOD and those kinds of contacts. But I think 
that Texas is in the limelight. We are what's going

05:58.540 --> 06:02.440
to happen in the next. The problems that you 
address here are also the problems of the nation.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.740
And so it's just... . . . We haven't really become 
very focused by being one of the most cuts-off

06:10.720 --> 06:15.940
zosta. Angling . Were there any particular 
critical turning points besides this one?

06:22.670 --> 06:33.120
Because there is time that you felt TEAS was 
threatened because of this

06:22.670 --> 06:33.120
new land... I don't know if there was any 
particular piece of legislation. . . . It didn't

06:37.820 --> 06:42.560
seem to be a high sort of legislation but the 
governor's commission. . . . . . The governor said

06:46.540 --> 06:57.690
early

06:46.540 --> 06:57.690
on in documents get documents for you, but we'll do 
that later. Porter went over to participate in the

07:04.470 --> 07:09.850
engineering extension service staff 
development conference and one of the speakers

07:04.470 --> 07:09.850
was Vic Arnold and he was quoted from part of the 
research that he had done as director of the Texas

07:09.830 --> 07:16.090
2000. It stated that there is no state agency to do 
R&D instead and we're sitting on here doing we

07:26.300 --> 07:35.400
started TTI and we're doing about 24 million 
dollars worth of research per year and so we

07:35.380 --> 07:39.880
thought maybe we might need to go talk to this 
person and let him know that we exist and so we did

07:41.970 --> 07:47.830
that and actually as one of the recommendations 
initially they were going to recommend that there

07:47.810 --> 07:57.340
be a state agency created to do research and 
development. We were invited to make a

07:57.320 --> 07:59.660
presentation to the subcommittee on research and 
development for the Texas 2000. This was Paul

08:04.669 --> 08:06.300
Thayer, while he was still president of LTV before 
he was president of the national chamber. He went

08:15.000 --> 08:21.948
to some government position.

08:22.409 --> 08:23.250
A.B. Holliday,

08:25.192 --> 08:40.050
just a wide variety

08:25.192 --> 08:40.050
of people,

08:40.030 --> 08:54.690
Harvey McManus, a

08:40.030 --> 08:54.690
wide variety of people

08:40.030 --> 08:54.690
told them what the engineering experiment 
station did and described it in the concept of

08:56.360 --> 09:03.220
event which was just then coming up as a way to 
address the needs of the Joe Glove on the street in

09:03.200 --> 09:10.770
dealing with the ideas how to spur 
entrepreneurism and how to get every person to see

09:10.750 --> 09:20.760
that there is a need for R&D and can't have a good 
idea and

09:20.740 --> 09:25.541
somebody can't help it. The final recommendation 
in the target 2014 was that there be that the

09:29.780 --> 09:34.760
institute for bridges and new technology which 
changed names about six process we had to call them

09:34.740 --> 09:39.060
all the time to tell them what we were calling it. 
That week it served as a prototype for similar

09:39.040 --> 09:53.000
types of efforts and there wasn't a 
recommendation.

09:52.980 --> 10:00.350
That's probably the closest that I... Was there 
recognition by them that A&M existed for R&D? Oh

10:02.465 --> 10:06.190
well with the invent statement yeah that was that 
was a major

10:06.890 --> 10:16.240
these were people in Austin that had worked for 
YouTube before to work on this project and went

10:17.420 --> 10:22.480
back to work for UT as director of Bureau of 
Business Research afterwards so it opened their

10:22.460 --> 10:26.716
eyes.

10:29.807 --> 10:33.280
Is that the most successful period? Well I think 
getting invent passed I really don't think that

10:33.260 --> 10:39.120
people internally had as much confidence as those 
as people that legislation would pass in a very

10:49.900 --> 10:54.080
hectic session and that funding would be we

10:54.140 --> 11:07.200
got a million dollars in a very very tight fiscal 
biennium and the legislative budget board didn't

11:07.180 --> 11:11.840
recommend any money for it because they felt like 
the legislator needed legislature needed to say

11:11.820 --> 11:19.370
this was something so new and so different that 
they had to have the whole you know legislative the

11:20.230 --> 11:25.050
house and senate vote on to demonstrate that this 
was the expenditure of money for the because it was

11:28.980 --> 11:35.350
it created a precedent that had not existed there 
is state law that said you cannot spend money you

11:35.330 --> 11:44.670
can't give money to a property we couldn't invest 
in private we had to invest for the public good and

11:44.650 --> 11:51.080
we had to then do our legislation what it really 
says is that we agree that the institute exists for

11:51.060 --> 12:01.170
them and even though it helps individual people 
that's going to benefit us by creating more jobs

12:01.150 --> 12:07.720
exactly and um so that bill did not pass

12:07.700 --> 12:20.350
the session was over very shortly thereafter and 
at the last minute was added the money was added as a

12:20.330 --> 12:32.920
rider in the program

12:20.330 --> 12:32.920
to give us money to operate that that was a major I'm 
trying to think if there has been a well here is just

12:32.900 --> 12:44.820
one turning point right I think that another 
turning point is our working relationships in our

12:44.800 --> 12:54.690
cooperative agreements as well research centers 
and physical facilities.

13:02.100 --> 13:07.890
so that that will be a milestone.

13:07.870 --> 13:12.050
Is there a project that you think T should have 
pursued that they didn't? Oh, there's a lot of them

13:12.030 --> 13:32.360
that

13:12.030 --> 13:32.360
we're still

13:12.030 --> 13:32.360
finding

13:12.030 --> 13:32.360
ways to work with Mexico again, establish 
international,

13:32.340 --> 13:40.300
and that just doesn't happen over and over again. 
When did that process begin? Oh, again, I think

13:43.000 --> 13:49.350
that was a mindset that we all felt comfortable

13:43.000 --> 13:49.350
with. You had it started before that, then? Well, 
there had been, I think, Vincent will tell

13:51.230 --> 14:00.280
you. We're just now beginning to see the real 
importance of recognizing we're

14:00.260 --> 14:11.280
in a global economy. The effort you're making 
right now is within the continent,

14:11.260 --> 14:22.790
right? You made a comment about the role of T as an 
educator. Can you expand any more on what you think

14:27.220 --> 14:33.610
that role is and how it has changed? Well, we're 
evolving another, I don't know if it will ever

14:33.590 --> 14:40.280
become a division, but it's a laboratory. It's a 
laboratory center called the Learning

14:41.060 --> 14:44.280
Technology Center, and this is a way to link 
engineers and educators to work on the question of

14:44.260 --> 14:52.480
how people learn. And I think technology is a tool 
that I don't know that current

14:52.460 --> 15:10.950
theory is transferable to technological tools. I 
think you may learn very differently using a

15:10.930 --> 15:18.220
terminal, using a video disk, using... You may not 
have to be in a particular building. You may not

15:23.100 --> 15:26.760
have to be in a particular place. Those 
flexibilities can change the educational

15:26.740 --> 15:38.400
environment and can change the whole educational 
process. Many people in the public schools are

15:38.380 --> 15:51.630
adamant about it because they aren't

15:38.380 --> 15:51.630
convinced it will do anything different. Much of 
what's been produced so far is not very good. We're

15:56.160 --> 16:00.890
just on the verge of having any... put together 
anything that doesn't want to just entertain you.

16:06.400 --> 16:15.280
So,

16:06.400 --> 16:15.280
it's as close to basic research as I have found.

16:15.260 --> 16:24.720
What about the role of the research in, like, 
aerodynamic research? Is there much interplay

16:24.700 --> 16:28.620
between those? Well, I think that...

16:33.160 --> 16:35.690
Let me see if I understand your question. Are you 
interested in how technology impacts teaching,

16:35.670 --> 16:39.290
aerodynamics, or... How T's... How research is 
going on at T's. Is it... Is it used in classroom

16:42.170 --> 16:48.800
instruction or...? You will find that 80% of our 
employees are faculty.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.241
They're joint employees. We just buy out their 
time, sort of. And so, they... The things they

17:03.980 --> 17:10.020
learn in the laboratory are immediately 
transferable to their classroom. And, in fact, in

17:10.000 --> 17:15.020
a lot of cases, much of the work done in the 
laboratory is done by the graduate students. So,

17:15.000 --> 17:16.221
it's a learning... What I hope evolves with our 
research park, and what I hope... What I think is

17:21.370 --> 17:28.680
going to happen at the graduate level, 
eventually, especially in the technical league,

17:28.660 --> 17:33.680
is like we have teaching hospitals for medicine 
and veterinary medicine right now. We have

17:33.660 --> 17:37.680
teaching companies that come and locate in 
research parks, where not only do you have the

17:37.660 --> 17:44.280
laboratories where you're doing whatever it is 
the company does, but those become a learning

17:44.260 --> 17:48.280
mechanism. The buildings may have classrooms 
built right into them. And the people who are in

17:51.360 --> 18:05.780
industry also become...

18:05.760 --> 18:10.150
It's a way down the road, I think. The research park 
that you're talking about has... How is that...

18:13.520 --> 18:17.390
What is the status of that? As far as I know, they 
have selected the A&E for an architecture and

18:17.370 --> 18:25.060
engineering firm that's going to do the 
construction. Streets, sewers... They've got to

18:26.555 --> 18:28.555
get all the utilities set up. They... You 
wouldn't... But they do have funding, too. Yeah.

18:33.476 --> 18:38.040
Is it state funding, or...? Uh-huh. Well, it's 
available funding. What they're going to do is,

18:42.910 --> 18:48.870
you know, you wouldn't go buy a lot in a subdivision 
if it didn't have a road, if it didn't have a sewer,

18:48.850 --> 18:53.970
if it didn't have water and utilities, and you 
didn't know how much it cost. So they're in the

18:56.350 --> 18:59.520
process of that. But they have committed 
themselves, T's committed themselves to doing

18:59.500 --> 19:03.700
this and developing it? Well, now it's the 
university that's actually the person. Okay, so

19:05.980 --> 19:06.679
the university. It's not going to be a T's... No, 
we're connected to it in that we're supportive of

19:07.480 --> 19:11.300
it, but... It's actually... There's a vice 
chancellor for the research parking group, so

19:13.464 --> 19:31.360
it's really a system project.

19:31.340 --> 19:41.490
How have external events

19:31.340 --> 19:41.490
affected

19:31.340 --> 19:41.490
you? Oh, I think that we're... I think external 
events affect us in that there are things that need

19:43.380 --> 19:49.190
to be done in research areas that sometimes are 
easier to, quote-unquote, sell based upon what's

19:49.170 --> 20:04.340
much more receptive to education. Since Nation at 
Risk, since the national reports come out, since

20:04.520 --> 20:13.240
we've had the governor's report on the time. That 
is a topic that will be, hopefully, the

20:13.220 --> 20:20.710
legislature will be receptive to. But they're 
receptive to their problems, and what we try to do

20:20.690 --> 20:27.110
is anticipate what the problems are and already 
have research teams in place or beginning... the

20:27.090 --> 20:38.540
beginnings of that put together so that we can 
respond. Our best bet is if we can anticipate the

20:38.920 --> 20:49.120
problem before they do, before they begin to feel, 
so that we can respond by saying, Yes, we're

20:49.100 --> 20:50.436
working in that area. Here's what we can do. So what 
we do... We work in the future. We work on things

20:54.259 --> 20:56.140
that haven't been done before. That's Mars. 
Figure out what it is next. So you've done that with

20:59.480 --> 21:05.270
education in terms of... Are there any other 
things that you, you know, have since... Oh, sure.

21:06.054 --> 21:06.717
Space... The space technology effort and space 
exploitation and commercial event. But what...

21:13.290 --> 21:26.980
What we did... We do program with

21:13.290 --> 21:26.980
what they have done, what the problems are, where 
they see research going. And a recurring theme

21:26.960 --> 21:36.600
year before last was that there's going to be a 
renewed emphasis, but with a different... Not

21:36.580 --> 21:42.360
just in getting there and getting back, but what do 
you do once you're there? And so we begin to toward

21:42.340 --> 21:46.133
that area and begin to... So

21:48.019 --> 21:54.260
planning... It's been since then that the 
president has come in. We're going to have a

21:58.353 --> 22:03.490
station. And that... There has been private 
companies springing up that are trying to go into

22:06.260 --> 22:15.190
business because they... That NASA's thinking 
about turning the shuttle over to some private

22:15.170 --> 22:23.380
contractor for commercial, you know, operation. 
So that they anticipate it. All we have to do a lot of

22:25.845 --> 22:27.380
times is... Who do you

22:27.360 --> 22:37.060
listen to? Researchers and people. Yes and no. 
People. You can read... You know, you can... You

22:43.950 --> 22:48.970
can follow a chain of events and just... If

22:48.950 --> 22:54.640
you think far enough... You think that in itself is 
a skill to... Oh, yeah. Yeah. I read something

22:59.860 --> 23:02.880
recently that described it really well. And this 
psychologist or sociologist said that there are

23:02.860 --> 23:10.880
one-year people and there are ten-year people and 
five-year people. He said some people... If

23:12.050 --> 23:15.880
you're a one-year person, you can only think in 
one-year time frame. And you think everybody else

23:15.860 --> 23:19.130
thinks that way, too. My... I have always...

23:20.258 --> 23:24.244
Well, for a long time. I don't guess I was aware of 
it. But... I have... For a long time, I've known

23:27.670 --> 23:36.160
that I think of ideas and can go in and get them in 
place. But they may not be really implemented and

23:36.140 --> 23:44.160
used for three, four, five, ten years. And then 
come up with products for others. Yeah. It just

23:48.501 --> 24:05.270
happens that, you know,

23:48.501 --> 24:05.270
the use and application and receptivity to 
something.

24:07.730 --> 24:09.985
You've got to have all of those kinds of people. You 
can't have all... People that just think in

24:10.025 --> 24:13.750
ten-year terms. You know, I mean, think way out 
there. Or you wouldn't get today's problem.

24:25.470 --> 24:25.951
Oh. That's my line. What is your general 
assessment

24:27.134 --> 24:38.580
of that? You want to start there, and then I'll ask 
the rest of them? Yeah. Oh. The ease is a benefit

24:44.987 --> 25:04.880
in

24:44.987 --> 25:04.880
that it is a place that has the flexibility to 
long-term ideas and to short-range needs. If a

25:04.860 --> 25:11.780
researcher comes in today and says, boy, if I could 
just do this, this, and this, then we'd have this

25:11.760 --> 25:15.280
research project, and this would really help 
where we're going. It would help Texas A&M. It's

25:17.652 --> 25:18.280
really... We don't see ourselves as separate and 
apart. The people that work for us are both. I think

25:23.760 --> 25:32.900
that's hard for administrators that are in charge 
of academics to realize sometimes. We're not

25:32.880 --> 25:35.920
trying to fight over who this person belongs to. 
We're just trying to support good programs. In

25:38.900 --> 25:46.920
fact, a lot of the programs that TEAS has developed 
traditionally have then become universal. There

25:46.900 --> 25:58.540
are things like that that initially were started 
by TEAS, either because TEAS had

25:58.520 --> 26:05.670
fiscal capability and flexibility, because it 
has a flexibility with this

26:05.650 --> 26:18.900
that

26:05.650 --> 26:18.900
university has not felt it had. And

26:18.880 --> 26:33.770
also... TEAS seems to me to be the place that's been 
able to take...

26:33.750 --> 26:34.804
Yeah, let's try this. We'll try cyclotron. And 
then if it's not what we need, well, you know...

26:40.160 --> 26:43.180
There have been a lot of things that they've shut 
down. But it's a place where you can... That's what

26:43.160 --> 26:52.630
research...

26:52.610 --> 27:02.220
I think it's given the state very recently a 
capability and a... They didn't have to waste

27:02.200 --> 27:07.100
energy, time, and resources. They can draw upon 
something they've been in place for a hundred

27:07.080 --> 27:12.480
years. Or

27:13.460 --> 27:17.550
for seventy years. I think it will become more

27:17.530 --> 27:28.200
important

27:17.530 --> 27:28.200
in the next twenty years than it has in the past, 
simply because if you will look at the scale, you

27:31.180 --> 27:34.340
can almost see an upturn. We have, in the last four 
years, grown at over twenty-five percent per

27:34.320 --> 27:38.750
year. Fiscally? Fiscally. There is a larger 
demand. And

27:43.970 --> 27:55.880
there is going to be a larger need for what we

27:43.970 --> 27:55.880
need in the future, especially in Texas. There 
needs to be a resource for... For those industries

27:57.860 --> 28:00.880
to draw on. For capable answers to questions. 
Working relationships and also at twenty pounds.

28:09.320 --> 28:22.920
What

28:09.320 --> 28:22.920
is the value of T's to basic science versus 
technology? I'm not sure that there is a

28:22.900 --> 28:26.800
difference. I'd be interested in your definition 
of a difference. I'm not sure there's a difference

28:30.220 --> 28:31.241
either. Dr. Seeley is sure there's a difference. 
And he hasn't been able to explain it to me well

28:34.220 --> 28:38.240
enough for me to understand it either. But...

28:38.220 --> 28:51.510
To the extent that basic science is the theory upon 
technology. You've got to start it with a problem.

28:53.490 --> 28:54.511
And to me that's it. You have a problem, then you're 
working on something that's applied. Before you

28:57.490 --> 28:59.510
even get into the basics. I think there's research 
and there's development. And I think that in the

29:02.490 --> 29:07.660
body of research, it's very hard to tell. Or 
generic.

29:12.053 --> 29:21.440
Because you may be working on, discover something 
that's very non-intentionally,

29:21.420 --> 29:25.160
but you can't prevent that from happening. Also, 
you can be working to

29:25.140 --> 29:39.550
discover things that are of benefit.

29:39.530 --> 29:48.790
What you can say is, this is the research part, and 
this is the development.

29:48.770 --> 29:50.790
Is T's involved in both? T's was not involved in the 
organization as much as it might be if it is a

29:50.770 --> 30:05.460
vehicle where when you discover something. Or we 
also are much more sophisticated in our

30:16.100 --> 30:20.120
trying to be aware of how that will benefit the 
researcher and the university. An example

30:20.100 --> 30:37.880
is a germ-fueled protein recently discovered 
process for

30:20.100 --> 30:37.880
something that there

30:37.860 --> 30:51.940
is a university more secure. Dan Davis negotiated 
a contract licensing agreement. And

30:56.200 --> 31:06.590
Jim Lawhon is taking home a minimum of $200,000 a 
year for the next year. And probably the estimates

31:06.570 --> 31:08.590
on a max would be $200,000. The same amount of money 
comes back to him. But, that's development. And we

31:22.460 --> 31:24.720
help with that. But the research is really cool. 
Some

31:26.700 --> 31:38.480
people have said basic research is what you do. 
Well, the pure science, I think, versus the

31:38.460 --> 31:44.420
engineering, I think is... And

31:44.400 --> 31:49.900
that's what I get from the survey. I say, show me 
what the difference is. Because I can take him into

31:51.880 --> 31:59.550
some laboratories,

31:51.880 --> 31:59.550
the Zachry building. There are far more pure 
science than most of the things. And most of the

32:01.530 --> 32:05.850
things you'll find in the kitchens. They're 
physics. They're solid-state electronics.

32:12.540 --> 32:15.030
It's back to the interdisciplinary thing. I don't

32:15.010 --> 32:28.480
know

32:15.010 --> 32:28.480
that. Is there anything else you'd like to add to 
this? I should know that I don't know. Or

32:33.380 --> 32:41.590
that I haven't asked. You will run across

32:41.570 --> 32:50.780
the difference. I don't know all the answers, but I 
can point you in the right direction.
