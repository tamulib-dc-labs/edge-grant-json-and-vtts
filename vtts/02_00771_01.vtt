WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:12.908
It's real hard to just strike out and say, we're 
going to do this. And it's hard to explain, I think,

00:12.928 --> 00:23.068
to the average citizen how engineering research 
affects their lives. until you can give them some

00:23.369 --> 00:27.599
concrete examples. And so what we try to do is put it 
in language and explain it, especially to the

00:27.619 --> 00:40.551
legislature, what it is we do and how it has an 
impact on the future.

00:43.417 --> 00:47.704
Isn't Invent kind of targeted to the individuals? 
Exactly. Doesn't matter where, you know,

00:48.705 --> 00:55.195
anybody, anywhere, you have an idea and you send it 
in and it will be reviewed. And the success ratio in

00:55.335 --> 01:05.491
selection is very small because most things have 
been thought of before or have been done better

00:55.335 --> 01:05.491
already. But it gives you an opportunity to find 
out for no charge. if there's a potential for

01:11.767 --> 01:36.115
something that will... We're primarily targeted 
at things that will create more jobs in the state,

01:11.767 --> 01:36.115
either enhance the productivity or the product 
line of businesses already in existence and or

01:11.767 --> 01:36.115
create new businesses that will hire people. What 
is the... How does the Research Foundation and

01:39.560 --> 01:45.149
TEAS

01:39.560 --> 01:45.149
work together? The Research Foundation is an 
entity that

01:45.169 --> 01:56.286
panels all of our federal contracts right now. To 
give you an example of how they function, we could

01:59.017 --> 02:15.471
buy a boat or a vessel for environmental 
engineering to use to do their research with, but

01:59.017 --> 02:15.471
we can't purchase the insurance. State entities 
can't buy insurance. They just, well, if you try to

02:18.237 --> 02:24.683
insure all these buildings, you'd be able to build 
one building a year from their previous. And so

02:24.703 --> 02:28.366
it's a good fiscal policy, except under certain 
circumstances. And so there is a need to have a

02:28.386 --> 02:33.990
vehicle that can do those kinds of things for you. 
So they serve special purpose needs. And in the

02:36.513 --> 02:47.502
past, they have also done an awful lot of the 
proposal preparation and the budget advisement

02:36.513 --> 02:47.502
and contract negotiations. As far as I know, they 
were very distinct operations when I came to work

02:47.920 --> 03:17.640
and

02:47.920 --> 03:17.640
have probably grown more distinct as opposed to a 
lot of the services we are able to do

03:18.278 --> 03:25.968
sometimes easier or quicker or better. Or what we 
find, we have to justify to the researcher that

03:26.289 --> 03:35.501
we're purchasing a service through the research 
foundation. And we've got to make sure that the

03:35.521 --> 03:39.927
researcher gets his money's worth. That we're 
being cost effective.

03:50.037 --> 03:57.692
During your short stint here, what has been the 
biggest period of change in teens? Oh, I think the

03:57.772 --> 04:07.692
fact that Skip was director has changed the whole 
perspective of the agency. In that it was

04:16.312 --> 04:24.883
much more aggressively attuned to serving the 
state and meeting the nation's problems. We found

04:26.285 --> 04:32.373
that so many people... T's had been a passive 
organization. Responsive, but passive, I think,

04:32.393 --> 04:36.418
in the past. And we found that many people who 
didn't know that it existed and that it could

04:36.438 --> 04:44.749
provide statewide service might have been on the 
way to creating another entity that was a state

04:45.539 --> 04:55.389
agency to do exactly what we were chartered to do 
initially. And so with that

04:55.409 --> 05:12.027
threat or possibility in mind, we realized that we 
really did exist and we did have a state charter. We

05:12.047 --> 05:13.909
were not just here to serve. Texas A&M University, 
and we were a college station. We were here to serve

05:17.775 --> 05:22.101
the state of Texas, and we could do that here. This 
is a good place to do it. We're structured well to do

05:23.864 --> 05:25.466
that. We just needed to be more open with the state 
and public officials in saying that we recognize

05:25.486 --> 05:37.663
our state charter and we're interested in helping 
our state partners. Do you think there's been a

05:37.683 --> 05:41.348
national emphasis before? has always been in 
securing contracts. We've always worked on a

05:44.149 --> 05:54.725
national basis as far as liaison with meeting Air 
Force and DOD and those kinds of contacts. But I

05:54.745 --> 05:59.573
think that Texas is in the limelight now. We are 
what's going to happen to the nation in many

05:59.941 --> 06:04.306
respects. The problems that you address here are 
also the problems of the nation. And so it's just

06:08.170 --> 06:15.317
become very focused.

06:15.337 --> 06:20.403
And so by doing more, most often we do it. Were there 
any particular critical turning points besides

06:20.423 --> 06:24.647
the reporters? Was there a time that you felt TEAS 
was threatened because of these new

06:24.707 --> 06:29.172
organizations? Well, I don't know if there was any 
particular piece of legislation that was

06:31.784 --> 06:37.609
written. It didn't get quite as far as 
legislation. But the governor's commission,

06:43.034 --> 06:51.742
Governor Clement set up the Texas 2000. And early 
on, I'd have to stop to get documents for you, but

06:51.762 --> 07:01.251
we'll do that later. Porter went over to 
participate in the Engineering Extension

07:01.602 --> 07:17.241
Service staff development conference and one of 
the speakers was Vic Arnold and he was quoted from

07:01.602 --> 07:17.241
part of the research that he had done as director of 
the Texas 2000. It stated that there is no state

07:17.261 --> 07:23.509
agency to do R&D in the state of Texas. And we're 
sitting over here doing, we still had TTI in with us

07:24.265 --> 07:29.329
at that time. And we were doing about $24 million 
worth of research per year. And so we thought,

07:34.974 --> 07:39.598
maybe we might need to go talk to this person and let 
him know that we exist. And so we did that. And

07:44.322 --> 07:52.990
actually, as one of the recommendations 
initially, they were going to recommend that

07:44.322 --> 07:52.990
their biggest agency created to do research and 
development technology. We were invited to make a

07:57.531 --> 08:04.680
presentation to a subcommittee on research and 
development for the Texas 2000. This was Paul

08:04.700 --> 08:14.793
Thayer, while he was still president of LTV before 
he became president of the National Chamber of

08:04.700 --> 08:14.793
Commerce. He went to some government position,

08:15.254 --> 08:20.260
too. A.B. Holliday, she's the largest realtor in 
the world. There's like 27 offices in the Dallas

08:25.441 --> 08:28.546
area. Just a wide variety

08:28.566 --> 08:33.193
of people. I think Dean Rostow from the LBJ School 
in UT Austin. Harvey McManus from the Institute of

08:40.263 --> 08:45.370
Constructive Capitalism. a wide variety of 
people on this panel. And we went and told them what

08:50.112 --> 09:13.669
the Engineering Experiment Station did, and 
described to them the concept of INFENT, which was

08:50.112 --> 09:13.669
just then coming up as a way to address the needs of 
the job low on the street in dealing with the ideas,

08:50.112 --> 09:13.669
how to spur entrepreneurism, and how to get every 
person to see that there is a need for R&D in their

09:14.763 --> 09:25.734
activities and that they can have a good idea and 
somebody can help them with that. The final

09:25.854 --> 09:36.824
recommendation and the target that you guys were 
looking for was that there be the Institute for

09:25.854 --> 09:36.824
Ventures in New Technology, which changed names 
about six times in that process. We had to call them

09:36.844 --> 09:40.508
all the time and tell them what we were calling them 
that week. It serves as a prototype. for similar

09:43.889 --> 09:48.454
types of efforts. And there wasn't a 
recommendation to create a new state agency to do

09:48.474 --> 09:52.820
R&D. That's probably the closest that I... Was 
there recognition by them that A&M existed for

09:53.180 --> 10:02.171
R&D? Oh, well, with the invent statement, yeah. 
That was a major coup, I think, because these

10:05.855 --> 10:13.204
were... people in Austin that had worked for UT 
before and went to work on this project and went

10:13.437 --> 10:23.752
back to work for UT as Director of Bureau of 
Business Research afterwards. So it opened their

10:25.054 --> 10:29.180
eyes a lot.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.467
Is that the most successful period? Well, I think 
we're getting in vent past. I really don't think

10:36.791 --> 10:41.959
that people internally had as much confidence as 
people externally had that legislation would

10:42.682 --> 10:57.444
pass in a very hectic session and that funding 
would be secure.

10:58.725 --> 11:06.116
We got a million dollars in a very, very tight 
fiscal biennium. And the Legislative Budget

11:06.136 --> 11:09.381
Board didn't recommend any money for it. because 
they felt like the legislature needed to say this

11:09.665 --> 11:28.688
was something so new and so different that they had 
to have the whole House and Senate vote on to

11:09.665 --> 11:28.688
demonstrate that this was the expenditure of 
money for the public good. Because it created a

11:29.109 --> 11:33.554
precedent that had not existed before. There is 
state law that says you cannot spend money, you

11:37.880 --> 11:41.505
can't give money to a private individual. You 
couldn't invest in private, for private money. We

11:44.410 --> 11:45.992
had to invest for the public good. And we had to then 
do, our legislation, what it really says is that we

11:46.513 --> 11:58.470
agree that the Institute for Business and 
Technology exists for the public good of the

11:46.513 --> 11:58.470
state. And even though it helps individual 
people, that's going to benefit this whole state

11:58.490 --> 12:03.578
in the long run. By creating more jobs? Exactly. 
And So that bill did not pass

12:08.018 --> 12:15.066
until May 26th. The session was over very shortly 
thereafter. And at the last minute was added, the

12:18.930 --> 12:26.219
money was added as a rider in the appropriations 
bill. That's 1920. Yeah. To pay, to give us money to

12:27.780 --> 12:33.367
operate that on. That was a major turning point, I 
think. I'm trying to think if there have been

12:37.212 --> 12:43.318
others, because it seems like there have been. 
Here, it's just one turning point after another. I

12:46.921 --> 13:02.095
think that another turning point is our working 
relationships and our cooperative agreements

12:46.921 --> 13:02.095
move to be distributed industrial research 
centers, if that's what we're going to call it. So

13:02.115 --> 13:07.000
that that will be a milestone with you tomorrow. Is 
there a project that you think T should have

13:07.739 --> 13:12.004
pursued that they didn't? Oh, there's a lot of 
those.

13:21.175 --> 13:35.232
We're still working to

13:21.175 --> 13:35.232
find ways to work with Mexico and Canada to 
establish international ties and linkages. And

13:35.887 --> 13:39.532
that just doesn't happen overnight. It's going to 
take a long time. When did that process begin? Oh,

13:42.976 --> 13:49.264
again, I think that was a mindset that we all felt 
comfortable with when we came in. It hadn't

13:49.284 --> 13:51.126
started before that time? Well, there had been, I 
think Vincent will tell you, there had been ever

13:51.146 --> 13:58.155
before that. It was just something that, We're 
just now beginning to see the real importance of

13:59.933 --> 14:11.257
recognizing we're in a global economy, and 
participating on an international basis. The

14:11.277 --> 14:16.068
effort you're making right now is within the 
continent, right? Yes. You

14:18.260 --> 14:26.591
had made a comment about the role of TEAS in 
education. Can you expand any more on what you

14:26.611 --> 14:32.679
think that role is and how it has changed? Well, 
we're evolving another, I don't know if it will

14:33.560 --> 14:43.713
ever become Envision, but it's a laboratory 
center called the Learning Technology Center.

14:44.594 --> 14:47.558
And this is a way to link engineers and educators. 
to work on the question of how people learn. And I

14:52.505 --> 15:11.004
think technology is a tool that I don't know that 
current

14:52.505 --> 15:11.004
theory on learning is transferable to 
technological tools. I think you may learn very

15:11.024 --> 15:13.427
differently. using a terminal, using a video 
disk, using, you may not have to be in a particular

15:14.335 --> 15:26.790
building, you may not have to be in a particular 
place. Those flexibilities can change the

15:26.810 --> 15:36.842
educational environment and can change the whole 
educational process. Many people in public

15:38.523 --> 15:42.368
schools are adamantly opposed because they

15:43.293 --> 15:51.587
aren't convinced that we'll do anything 
different. And much of what's been produced so far

15:51.607 --> 15:56.174
is not very good. We're just on the verge of having 
anybody put together anything that doesn't want

15:56.194 --> 16:06.972
to just entertain you. It's as close to basic 
research as I have found. What about the role of the

16:15.332 --> 16:24.747
research and the aerodynamic research used in 
teaching aerodynamics here? Is there much

16:24.767 --> 16:30.917
interplay between those?

16:32.332 --> 16:35.756
Let me see if I understand your question. Are you 
interested in how technology impacts teaching,

16:35.776 --> 16:39.721
aerodynamics? How research is going on at TEAS? Is 
it used in classroom instruction? You will find

16:48.852 --> 16:55.981
that 80% of our employees are faculty in Texas A&E. 
They're joint employees. We just buy out their

16:57.242 --> 16:58.844
time. And so The things they learn in the 
laboratory are immediately transferable to

17:03.415 --> 17:10.085
their classroom. And in fact, in a lot of cases, 
much of the work done in the laboratory is done by

17:10.105 --> 17:14.972
the graduate students. And so it's a learning. 
What I hope evolves with our research part, and

17:16.775 --> 17:30.756
what I think is going to happen to education at the 
graduate level eventually, especially in the

17:16.775 --> 17:30.756
technical areas, is like we have teaching 
hospitals or medicine and veterinary medicine

17:31.360 --> 17:33.723
right now. We have teaching companies that come 
and locate in research parks where not only do you

17:33.743 --> 17:48.403
have the laboratories where you're really doing 
the work and doing whatever it is the company does,

17:33.743 --> 17:48.403
but those become a learning mechanism. The 
buildings may have classrooms built right into

17:48.423 --> 17:51.548
them. And the people who are in industry also 
become instructors, teachers, or facilitators

17:51.568 --> 18:00.540
in that process. Which is, it's a way down the road, 
I think, but it's kind of awesome. The research

18:10.140 --> 18:17.526
park that you're talking about, how is that, what 
is the status of that at this point? As far as I know,

18:17.546 --> 18:26.294
they have selected the A&E for an architecture and 
engineering firm that's going to do the

18:17.546 --> 18:26.294
construction of the streets, sewers. They've got 
to get all the utilities set up. You wouldn't But

18:30.828 --> 18:33.391
they do have funding to construct it? Yeah, 
they're going to do that. I think they

18:34.332 --> 18:37.255
appropriated probably about $7 million. Is it 
state funding? Well, it's available fund money.

18:42.880 --> 18:57.055
What they're going to do is, you know, you wouldn't 
go buy a lot in a subdivision if it didn't have a

18:42.880 --> 18:57.055
road, it didn't have a sewer, it didn't have water 
and utilities, and you didn't know how much it

18:42.880 --> 18:57.055
cost. They're in the process of getting it. But 
they have committed themselves, TEAS has

19:00.057 --> 19:03.660
committed themselves to doing this? Well, now 
it's the university that's actually the person.

19:06.623 --> 19:07.804
It's not going to be a TEAS project? No, we're 
connected to it in that we're supportive of it, but

19:07.884 --> 19:21.597
it's actually, there's a vice chancellor for the 
research park and corporate relations named Mark

19:07.884 --> 19:21.597
Mooney, and he reports to the chancellor. So it's 
really a system project. Which TEAS will only be

19:24.020 --> 19:25.581
part of. Yeah. How

19:27.528 --> 19:40.299
have external events affected your research 
funding, state or national? The economy? Oh, I

19:41.561 --> 19:42.802
think that we're... I think external events 
affect us in that there are things that need to be

19:43.402 --> 19:57.535
done in research areas that sometimes are easier 
to the quote-unquote sell based upon what

19:43.402 --> 19:57.535
happens. in the outside world. People become much 
more receptive to education technology since

20:00.077 --> 20:12.872
Nation at Risk came out, since the national 
reports have come out, since we've had the

20:00.077 --> 20:12.872
governor's report on education. That is a topic 
that will be, hopefully, the legislature will be

20:13.292 --> 20:20.361
receptive to when you go back next time. But 
they're receptive to their problems, and what we

20:20.701 --> 20:26.728
try to do is anticipate what the problems are, and 
already have research teams in place or the

20:26.995 --> 20:38.726
beginnings of that put together so that we can 
respond.

20:41.029 --> 20:50.438
Our best bet is if we can anticipate the problem 
before they do, before they begin to feel, so that

20:41.029 --> 20:50.438
we can respond by saying, yes, we're working in 
that area. Here's what we can do for you. So what we

20:52.660 --> 20:54.261
do, we work in the future. We work on things that 
haven't been done before. That's ours. to figure

20:57.725 --> 20:59.468
out what it is next. So you've done that with 
education in terms of restarting. Are there any

21:02.412 --> 21:05.778
other things that you know of since you've been 
here? Oh, sure. The space technology effort and

21:06.739 --> 21:11.507
space exploitation and commercialization. Dave 
Norton can tell you much more about that. But what

21:14.171 --> 21:17.215
we did, we do programming fees once a year. We sit 
down with every division head. and talk about what

21:19.223 --> 21:26.414
they have done, what they want to do, what their 
major problems are, where they see research

21:19.223 --> 21:26.414
going. And a recurring theme year before last was 
that there's going to be a renewed emphasis in

21:27.095 --> 21:35.448
space. But with a different, not just in getting 
there and getting back, but what do you do once

21:36.669 --> 21:41.637
you're there. And so we began to toy that area and 
began to put together some effort and some

21:42.275 --> 21:53.493
research activities there, some planning. And 
it's been since then that the president has come

21:53.513 --> 22:03.689
out and said, we're going to have a station. And 
that there has been private companies spring up

22:08.077 --> 22:15.388
that are trying to launch their own rockets and go 
into business because they think there's going to

22:08.077 --> 22:15.388
be a profit. That NASA's thinking about turning 
the shuttle over to some private contractor for

22:15.408 --> 22:23.661
commercial operation. So that they anticipate 
it. All we have to do a lot of times is listen. You

22:29.229 --> 22:34.437
just have to keep your ear to the ground to figure 
out what it is that's going to be on the floor. Who do

22:35.319 --> 22:36.801
you listen to? researchers and,

22:37.051 --> 22:43.625
well, yes and no, people. You can read, you know, 
you can follow a chain of events and just kind of

22:44.627 --> 22:54.587
begin to see if you think far enough You think that 
in itself is a skill to... Oh yeah. I read something

23:00.369 --> 23:11.261
recently that described it really well and this 
psychologist or sociologist said that there are

23:00.369 --> 23:11.261
one-year people and there are ten-year people and 
five-year people. He said some people, if you're a

23:11.281 --> 23:19.490
one-year person, you can only think in one-year 
time frame and you think everybody else thinks

23:11.281 --> 23:19.490
that way too. I have always...

23:24.537 --> 23:25.418
well, for a long time. I don't guess I was aware of 
it, but I for a long time have known that I think of

23:25.438 --> 23:43.717
ideas and can go ahead and get them in place, but 
they may not be really implemented and used for

23:25.438 --> 23:43.717
three, four, five, ten years. Come up with 
products for others. Yeah, it just happens that,

23:48.342 --> 23:53.667
you know,

23:48.342 --> 23:53.667
the The use and application and receptivity to 
some of that stuff just takes longer for other

23:55.435 --> 24:05.667
people to become comfortable with. But you've got 
to have all of those kinds of people. You can't have

24:09.992 --> 24:13.276
all people that just think in tenured terms. I 
mean, think way out there. Or you wouldn't get

24:15.499 --> 24:18.582
today's problem solved. But in terms of planning 
programs. Yeah.

24:24.443 --> 24:26.446
This is a biggie. What is your general assessment 
of the value of TEAS to A&M, to the state, to the

24:27.147 --> 24:37.801
nation, to the world? You want to start there and 
then I'll ask the rest of them? TEAS is a benefit to

24:44.991 --> 24:53.202
Texas A&M University that Texas A&M University 
does not really realize, I think. and that it is a

24:53.536 --> 25:05.209
place that has the flexibility to respond to 
long-term ideas and to short-range needs. If a

25:05.810 --> 25:15.261
researcher comes in today and says, boy, if I could 
just do this, this, and this, then we'd have this

25:05.810 --> 25:15.261
research project, and this would really help 
where we're going. It would help Texas A&M. We

25:18.304 --> 25:21.848
don't see ourselves as separate and apart. The 
people who work for us are both. I think that's hard

25:24.333 --> 25:37.206
for administrators that are in charge of 
academics to realize sometimes, is we're not

25:24.333 --> 25:37.206
trying to fight over who this person belongs to. 
We're just trying to support good programs. In

25:39.649 --> 25:52.602
fact, a lot of the programs that TEAS has developed 
traditionally have then become university

25:39.649 --> 25:52.602
property, so to speak, the cyclotron, the data 
processing center. There are things like that

25:53.020 --> 26:22.099
that initially were started by TEAS, either 
because TEAS had

25:53.020 --> 26:22.099
fiscal capability and flexibility, because it 
has a flexibility with its financial status that

25:53.020 --> 26:22.099
the university has not felt

25:53.020 --> 26:22.099
it had, I think, sometimes. Also, he seems to me to 
be the place that's been able to take a calculated

26:24.087 --> 26:34.956
risk and say, yeah, let's try this. We'll try 
cyclotron. And then if it's not what we need, well,

26:36.557 --> 26:44.224
there have been a lot of things that they've shut 
down. But it's a place where you can. That's what

26:45.545 --> 26:48.447
research is all about.

26:52.451 --> 26:53.892
I think it's given. the state very recently a 
capability and they didn't have to waste energy,

26:54.597 --> 27:07.553
time, and resources going to create something 
like this. They can draw upon something they've

27:07.573 --> 27:17.566
been in place for 70 years. I think it will become 
more important to the state in the next 20 years.

27:23.234 --> 27:28.319
than

27:23.234 --> 27:28.319
it has in the past. Because if you will look at the 
scale, you can almost see an upturn. We have in the

27:34.606 --> 27:38.070
last four years grown at over 25% per year. 
Physically? Physically. There is a larger demand

27:42.074 --> 27:46.859
for what we do. And there is going to be a larger need 
for what we do. In the future, especially in Texas,

27:50.791 --> 27:56.920
you're going to become a high technologist. There 
needs to be a resource for those industries to draw

27:57.000 --> 28:16.669
on for capable answers to questions, working 
relationships, and

27:57.000 --> 28:16.669
also a trained talent pool. What is the value of 
TEAS to basic science research? versus

28:20.542 --> 28:22.946
technology research. I'm not sure that there is a 
difference. I'd be interested in your definition

28:26.994 --> 28:29.999
of what the difference is. I'm not sure there's a 
difference either. Dr. Seeley is sure there's a

28:31.502 --> 28:39.316
difference, and he hasn't been able to explain it 
to me well enough for me to understand it either.

28:39.336 --> 28:43.444
But to the extent that... Basic science is the 
theory upon which you build the reality of

28:44.757 --> 28:51.066
technology. Sure, but you've got to start it with a 
problem. Right. Okay, and to me that's it. You have

28:54.692 --> 29:00.000
a problem, then you're working on something 
that's applied before you even get into the

28:54.692 --> 29:00.000
basics. I think there's research and there's 
development. Okay. And I think that in the body of

29:03.365 --> 29:09.634
research, it's very hard to tell what's basic and 
applied. or generic, because you may be working on

29:10.087 --> 29:21.400
a particular application and discover something 
that's very generic in its nature that applies to

29:10.087 --> 29:21.400
you. Not intentionally, but you can prevent that 
from happening. Also, you can be working on

29:25.104 --> 29:34.795
something very basic, but the purpose of basic 
research is to discover things that are of

29:25.104 --> 29:34.795
benefit, which means they have application. You 
can't structure it where you do one or the other.

29:39.442 --> 29:44.246
What you can say is this is the research part and 
this is the development. This is where I take it to

29:44.266 --> 29:47.248
the marketplace. So is TEAS involved in both? TEAS 
was not involved in the marketing or the

29:50.571 --> 30:02.661
commercialization as much in the past as it might 
be in the future through Invent. Invent is a

30:03.442 --> 30:04.883
vehicle where when you discover something, you 
can do that. Or we also are much more sophisticated

30:08.317 --> 30:21.996
in our

30:08.317 --> 30:21.996
trying to be aware of how that will benefit the 
researcher and the university in the state. An

30:23.117 --> 30:32.490
example is there's a researcher in food protein 
who recently discovered a patentable process for

30:34.951 --> 30:38.156
what it is, but something that .

30:46.769 --> 30:50.756
There is a university system patent office. The 
patent was secured. Dan Davis negotiated a

30:53.220 --> 30:59.169
contract licensing agreement with a company from 
Japan. And Jim is taking home a minimum of $200,000

31:02.913 --> 31:10.203
a year for the next two years, and probably the 
estimates on a max would be $2 million a year. That

31:11.244 --> 31:16.972
same amount of money comes back to the university 
system or continues as a system part, since that's

31:11.244 --> 31:16.972
where it gets work. But that's development, and we 
help with that. But the research is really

31:24.822 --> 31:27.486
important. I'd be interested in Dr. Seaway's 
definition.

31:35.071 --> 31:38.656
Some people have said basic research is what you do 
when you don't know what you're doing. Well, the

31:38.676 --> 31:48.410
pure science, I think, versus the engineering, I 
think, is the

31:38.676 --> 31:48.410
difference. In that standpoint, I'd be from 
Missouri. I'd say, show me what the difference is.

31:52.335 --> 31:57.102
Because I can take him into some laboratories 
and... the Zachry building, there are far more

31:58.381 --> 32:05.688
pure science than most of the things you'll find in 
the chemistry department. They're physics.

32:06.429 --> 32:12.275
They're solid state electronics, but that's 
physics.

32:12.295 --> 32:14.557
And it's back to the interdisciplinary question. 
And I don't know that you can pull it apart that

32:14.657 --> 32:22.645
much. It'll be interesting to see.

32:28.098 --> 32:41.623
Is there anything else you'd like to add to this 
that you think I should know that I don't know or

32:28.098 --> 32:41.623
that I haven't

32:28.098 --> 32:41.623
asked? You will run across death as you go along. 
Thank

32:47.032 --> 32:55.315
you very much.

32:57.702 --> 32:58.223
Sure.
