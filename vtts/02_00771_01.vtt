WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:13.590
It's

00:01.930 --> 00:13.590
real hard to just strike out, you know, and say 
we're going to do this, and it's hard to explain, I

00:13.570 --> 00:23.050
think, to the average citizen how engineering 
research affects their lives until

00:23.030 --> 00:43.260
you try to do is put it in what

00:23.030 --> 00:43.260
it is we do, and now it has an impact.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.440
Isn't invent kind of targeted to the individual? 
Exactly. It doesn't matter where, you know,

00:48.607 --> 00:52.980
anybody, anywhere, you have an idea, and you send 
it in, and it will be reviewed, and the success

00:52.960 --> 01:01.120
ratio in selection is very small, because most 
things have been thought of before or have been

01:01.100 --> 01:07.130
done better already, but it gives you an 
opportunity to find out for no charge if there's a

01:07.110 --> 01:16.370
potential for something that will, we're 
primarily targeted at things that will create.

01:20.790 --> 01:29.380
More jobs, and it's going to enhance the 
productivity or the product line of businesses

01:20.790 --> 01:29.380
already in existence, and or create new 
businesses.

01:35.830 --> 01:41.570
What is, how

01:35.830 --> 01:41.570
does the Research Foundation entail? The

01:41.550 --> 01:55.200
Research Foundation is an entity that

01:41.550 --> 01:55.200
panels all of our federal companies.

01:59.040 --> 02:07.700
To give you an example of what they, how they 
function, we cannot, we could buy a boat or a

02:07.680 --> 02:08.244
vessel. We could buy a boat for environmental 
engineering to use, to do their research with, but

02:08.787 --> 02:13.780
we can't purchase the insurance. State entities 
can't buy the insurance. They just, well, if you

02:18.460 --> 02:21.840
try to insure all these buildings, you'd be able to 
build one building a year from their premiums, and

02:21.820 --> 02:27.440
so it's a good fiscal policy, except under certain 
circumstances, and so there is a need to have a

02:27.420 --> 02:33.940
vehicle that can do those kinds of things. So they 
serve special purpose needs, and in the past, they

02:33.920 --> 02:38.640
have also, they've been able to do a lot more than an 
awful lot of the proposal preparation and

02:38.620 --> 02:47.960
contract negotiations for various. And at one 
point, they were almost

02:51.211 --> 02:59.780
one of the cities. They've been fairly well 
separated since the late 70s, haven't they? As far

03:03.120 --> 03:06.740
as I know, they were, they were very distinct 
operations. They

03:06.720 --> 03:13.590
have probably grown more. A lot of the services, we 
are able to do

03:13.570 --> 03:28.580
easier, quicker, or better, or what we find, we 
have to justify to the researchers. That we're

03:29.560 --> 03:36.940
purchasing a service, you know, and we've got to 
make sure that the researcher gets his money's

03:36.920 --> 03:50.160
worth, and the university, you know, that we're, 
we're being cost-effective.

03:50.140 --> 03:57.510
During your short stint here, what has been the 
biggest

03:50.140 --> 03:57.510
topic? Oh, I think the fact that the whole,

03:57.490 --> 04:20.820
and that it was

03:57.490 --> 04:20.820
much more aggressively tuned to serving the 
staff. We found that so many people, you know, they

04:23.351 --> 04:27.610
were, you know, they were, you know, they been a 
passive organization. entity, and it was a state

04:32.590 --> 04:45.680
agency to do exactly what we were chartered to do, 
and so, with that threat, or possibility, relates

04:45.660 --> 05:03.850
to what's happening neighbor, so, we have to 
appetite

05:03.830 --> 05:04.851
and outperform it. Right. Yeah. we realized that 
we really did exist, and we did have a state

05:06.830 --> 05:11.850
charter. We were not just here to serve Texas A&M 
University, and we were a college station. We were

05:17.830 --> 05:21.850
here to serve the state of Texas, and we could do 
that here. This is a good place to do it. We just

05:25.320 --> 05:31.560
needed to be more open with state and public 
officials in saying that we recognize our state

05:31.540 --> 05:37.720
charter. Do you think there has been national 
emphasis before? It has always been in securing

05:41.750 --> 05:43.770
contracts. We've always worked on a national 
basis as far as LAIS on meeting Air Force and DOD and

05:47.750 --> 05:54.600
those kinds of contacts. But I think that Texas is 
in the long line. We are what's going to happen in

06:00.460 --> 06:04.720
the next. The problems that you address here are 
also the problems of the nation. And so it's

06:08.700 --> 06:10.780
just... We've become very focused

06:10.760 --> 06:19.730
by doing one most often duty. Were there any 
particular critical turning points besides the

06:19.710 --> 06:23.730
report? Was there a time that you felt TEAS was 
threatened because of these

06:23.710 --> 06:33.160
new... I don't know if there was any particular 
piece of legislation that... It didn't get quite

06:37.860 --> 06:42.600
as far as legislation, but the governor's 
commission... Governor Plymouth set up the

06:45.580 --> 06:53.560
Texas...

06:53.540 --> 06:58.730
Early on, it got canceled. But we'll do that later. 
Porter went over to participate in the

07:03.710 --> 07:07.730
Engineering Extension Service staff 
development conference. And one of the speakers

07:07.710 --> 07:09.730
was Vic Arnold. And he was quoted from part of the 
research that he had done as director of the Texas

07:13.710 --> 07:16.730
2000. It stated that there is no state agency to do 
R&D. And we're sitting over here doing... We

07:26.300 --> 07:28.320
started TTI in with this event. And we're doing 
about $24 million. We're doing about $24 million

07:30.160 --> 07:35.240
worth of research per year. And so we thought maybe 
we might need to go talk to this person and let him

07:38.300 --> 07:40.320
know that we exist. And so we did that. And 
actually, as one of the recommendations

07:43.290 --> 07:47.310
initially, they were going to recommend that 
there be a state agency created to do research and

07:52.290 --> 07:57.540
development. We were invited to make a 
presentation to a subcommittee on research and

08:00.520 --> 08:02.540
development for the Texas 2000. This was Paul 
Thayer, while he was still president of LTV,

08:08.520 --> 08:14.820
before he was president of the national chamber. 
He went to some government position. A.B.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.546
Holliday.

08:28.613 --> 08:30.280
Just a wide variety of people. Harvey

08:30.260 --> 08:43.137
McManus. A

08:43.157 --> 08:52.650
wide variety

08:43.157 --> 08:52.650
of people. Told them what the Engineering 
Experiment Station did. And described to them the

08:56.520 --> 08:59.540
concept of the event, which was just then coming up 
as a way to address the needs of the Joe Globe on the

09:04.440 --> 09:07.700
street. And dealing with the ideas, how to spur 
entrepreneurism. And how to get every person to

09:11.830 --> 09:16.800
see that there is a need for R&D and

09:16.780 --> 09:22.200
can't have a good idea and somebody can't help it. 
The

09:22.180 --> 09:29.380
final recommendation in the target 2000 report 
was that there be, that the Institute for Ventures

09:31.380 --> 09:34.400
and New Technology, which changed names about six 
classes, we had to tell them all the time, tell them

09:38.240 --> 09:41.280
what we were calling it that week, serve as a 
prototype. For

09:42.260 --> 09:47.640
similar types of efforts. And there wasn't a 
recommendation. That's

09:49.620 --> 09:57.200
probably the closest that I... Was there 
recognition by them that A&M existed for R&D? Oh,

10:01.970 --> 10:04.990
well with the invent statement. That was, that was 
a major. These

10:07.970 --> 10:16.240
were people in Austin that had worked for YouTube 
before. They went to work on this project. They

10:18.220 --> 10:20.240
went back to work for R&D. They went back to work for 
UT as Director of Bureau of Business Research

10:21.220 --> 10:25.130
afterwards. So it opened

10:25.110 --> 10:31.440
their eyes. Is that the most successful period? 
Well, I think getting invent passed. I really

10:36.420 --> 10:42.880
don't think that people internally had as much 
confidence as people externally. That

10:47.690 --> 10:52.960
legislation would pass in a very hectic session. 
And that funding would be...

10:58.870 --> 11:05.480
We got a million dollars in a very, very tight 
fiscal biennium. And the Legislative Budget

11:05.460 --> 11:09.480
Board didn't recommend any money for it. Because 
they felt like the Legislature needed to say this

11:13.460 --> 11:16.660
was something so new and so different that they had 
to

11:16.640 --> 11:23.970
have the whole House and Senate vote on it. To 
demonstrate that this was the expenditure of

11:23.950 --> 11:28.800
money for them. Because it was... It created a 
precedent that had not existed before. There is

11:32.780 --> 11:37.890
state law that says you cannot spend money... You 
can't give money to a project. You couldn't invest

11:39.870 --> 11:44.470
in a project. We had to invest for the public good. 
And we had to then do... Our legislation, what it

11:47.760 --> 11:52.800
really says is that we agree that the Institute 
exists for the public good. And even though it

11:58.650 --> 12:00.850
helps individual people, that's going to benefit 
the state. By creating more jobs? Exactly. And...

12:07.260 --> 12:10.520
So that bill did not pass. The

12:10.500 --> 12:19.270
session was over very shortly thereafter. And at 
the last minute was added... The money was added as

12:22.460 --> 12:28.800
a rider in the appropriate...

12:28.780 --> 12:33.200
To give us money to operate that. That was a 
major...

12:37.570 --> 12:43.100
I'm trying to think if there had been a... Here it's 
just one turning point after another. I think that

12:46.080 --> 12:49.160
another turning point is our working 
relationships and our cooperative agreements as

12:54.310 --> 12:57.440
bill research centers. So that that will be a 
milestone. Is there

13:02.900 --> 13:10.790
a project that you think T should have pursued that 
they didn't? Oh, there's a lot of them. I mean, look

13:13.810 --> 13:15.830
at the... No.

13:19.140 --> 13:30.350
We're still finding

13:19.140 --> 13:30.350
ways to work with Mexico again. Establish 
international. And that just doesn't happen

13:34.527 --> 13:37.960
overnight. When did that process begin? Oh, 
again, I think that was a mindset that we all felt

13:41.980 --> 13:45.120
comfortable with. And

13:45.100 --> 13:51.050
had it started before that time? Well, there had 
been... I think Vincent will tell

13:53.060 --> 14:00.480
you. We're just now beginning to see the real 
importance of recognizing we're in a global

14:02.460 --> 14:04.480
economy. The effort

14:04.460 --> 14:14.680
you're making right now is within the continent. 
You

14:14.660 --> 14:26.940
had made a comment about the role of T's in 
education. Can you expand any more on what you

14:26.920 --> 14:29.940
think that role is and how it has changed? Well, 
we're evolving another... I don't know if it will

14:37.860 --> 14:39.880
ever become a vision, but it's a laboratory center 
called the Learning Technology Center. And this

14:43.860 --> 14:48.280
is a way to link engineers and educators to work on 
the question of how people learn. And I think

14:52.260 --> 14:56.240
technology is a tool that... I don't know that 
current

14:56.220 --> 15:05.350
theory is transferable to technological tools. I 
think you may learn very differently using a

15:13.230 --> 15:16.920
terminal, using a video disk, using...you may not 
have to be in a particular building. You may not

15:21.900 --> 15:25.920
have to be in a particular place. Those

15:25.900 --> 15:32.830
flexibilities can change the educational 
environment and can change the whole educational

15:32.810 --> 15:36.830
process. Many people in the public schools are 
adamant about it because they aren't

15:41.280 --> 15:51.330
convinced it will do anything different. Much of 
what's been produced so far is not very good. We're

15:56.460 --> 16:01.290
just on the verge of having any... put together

16:01.270 --> 16:06.520
anything that doesn't want to just entertain you. 
So,

16:06.500 --> 16:15.280
it's as close to basic research as I have found.

16:15.260 --> 16:20.270
What about the role of the research and the 
aerodynamic research? Is there much interplay

16:24.900 --> 16:28.320
between those? Well, I think that...

16:33.260 --> 16:35.790
Let me see if I understand your question. Are you 
interested in how technology impacts teaching,

16:38.770 --> 16:42.790
dynamics, or... How research is going on at TEAS? 
Is it used in classroom instruction? Oh, sure. You

16:48.856 --> 16:51.600
will find that 80% of our employees are faculty. 
They're

16:51.580 --> 16:57.340
joint employees. We just buy out their time. And 
so, the

17:00.140 --> 17:06.720
things they learn in the laboratory are 
immediately transferable to their classroom.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.720
And in fact, in a lot of cases, much of the work done 
in the laboratory is done by the graduate

17:13.700 --> 17:14.721
students. And so, it's a learning. What I hope 
evolves with our research park and what I think is

17:20.170 --> 17:23.190
going to happen at the graduate level eventually, 
especially in a technical way, is like we have

17:28.460 --> 17:30.480
teaching hospitals for medicine and veterinary 
medicine right now. We have teaching companies

17:35.460 --> 17:37.480
that come and locate in research parks where not 
only do you have the laboratories where you're

17:40.460 --> 17:43.980
doing whatever it is the company does, but those 
become a learning mechanism that the buildings

17:46.960 --> 17:50.980
may have classrooms built right into. And the 
people who are in industry also become the way down

17:53.960 --> 18:10.150
the road.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.840
The research park that you're talking about, how 
is that? What is the status of that? As far as I know,

18:18.870 --> 18:20.890
they have selected the A&E firm, architecture and 
engineering firm, that's going to do the

18:21.870 --> 18:25.160
construction. Streets, sewers, they've got to 
get all the utilities set up. You wouldn't... But

18:30.919 --> 18:32.570
they do have funding, too. Is it state funding?

18:39.020 --> 18:42.830
Well, it's available funding. What they're going 
to do is, you know, you wouldn't go buy a lot in a

18:44.810 --> 18:47.880
subdivision if it didn't have a road, if it didn't 
have a sewer, if it didn't have water and

18:50.950 --> 18:52.970
utilities, and you didn't know how much it cost. So 
they're in the process of that. But they have

18:59.200 --> 19:01.220
committed themselves, TEAS has committed 
themselves to doing this? Well, now it's the

19:03.380 --> 19:04.401
university that's actually the person. It's not 
going to be a TEAS? No, we're connected to it in that

19:08.380 --> 19:10.400
we're supportive of it, but it's actually... 
There's a vice chancellor for the research park in

19:14.380 --> 19:17.750
Corberville, so it's really a system project. How

19:23.370 --> 19:35.080
have external events affected you? Oh,

19:35.060 --> 19:43.090
I think that we're... I think external events 
affect us in that there are things that need to be

19:45.070 --> 19:48.090
done in research areas that sometimes are easier 
to, quote, unquote, sell based upon what...

20:00.890 --> 20:02.910
much more receptive to education. Since Nation at 
Risk, since the national reports come out, since

20:08.110 --> 20:13.140
we've had the governor's report on... That is a 
topic that will be, hopefully, the legislature

20:15.120 --> 20:20.410
will be receptive to. But they're receptive to 
their problems, and what we try to do is anticipate

20:24.390 --> 20:26.410
what the problems are and already have research 
teams in place or beginning... the beginnings of

20:30.390 --> 20:35.240
that put together so that we can respond. As 
they're... Our best bet is if we can anticipate the

20:42.070 --> 20:44.090
problem before they do, before they begin to feel, 
so that we can respond by saying, yes, we're

20:48.800 --> 20:49.821
working in that area, here's what we can do for it. 
So what we do... We work in the future. We work on

20:53.720 --> 20:55.740
things that haven't been done before. That's 
Mars. Figure out what it is next. So you've done

20:58.780 --> 21:00.800
that with education, in terms of... Are there any 
other things that you, you know, have since

21:03.150 --> 21:05.170
appeared here? Oh, pure space. The space 
technology effort and space exploitation and

21:09.150 --> 21:13.210
commercial effort. But what we did, we do program 
with

21:15.190 --> 21:21.140
what they have done, what problems are, where they 
see research going. And a recurring theme, year

21:26.060 --> 21:29.080
before last, was that there's going to be a renewed 
emphasis. But with a different... Not just in

21:36.980 --> 21:40.000
getting there and getting back, but what do you do 
once you're there? And so we begin to toward that

21:42.740 --> 21:51.160
area and begin some planning. It's been since then 
that the president has come in. We're going to have

21:58.710 --> 22:03.890
a station. And that there has been private 
companies spring up that are trying to go into

22:09.890 --> 22:15.190
business

22:15.170 --> 22:18.190
because NASA's thinking about turning the 
shuttle over to some private contractor for

22:20.860 --> 22:23.880
commercial, you know, operation. So that they 
anticipate it. All we have to do a lot of times is...

22:35.540 --> 22:37.560
Who do you listen to? Researchers.

22:42.266 --> 22:42.970
Yes and no. People. You can read, you know, you can 
follow a chain of events. If

22:48.950 --> 22:54.640
you think far enough... You think that in itself is 
a skill to... Oh yeah. Yeah. I read something

22:59.860 --> 23:02.880
recently that described it really well. And this 
psychologist or sociologist said that there are

23:05.860 --> 23:07.880
one-year people and there are ten-year people and 
five-year people. He said some people, if you're a

23:11.860 --> 23:12.881
one-year person, you can only think in one-year 
time frame. And you think everybody else thinks

23:15.860 --> 23:17.880
that way too. I have always, well for a long time, I

23:21.110 --> 23:26.130
don't guess I was aware of it, but for a long time 
I've known that I think of ideas and can go ahead and

23:31.170 --> 23:35.660
get them in place. But they may not be really 
implemented and used for three, four, five, ten

23:38.640 --> 23:43.160
years. And then come up with products for others. 
Yeah, it just happens that, you know, the...

23:50.647 --> 23:53.470
The... The use and application and receptivity to 
something.

24:05.250 --> 24:10.250
But you've got to have all of those kinds of people. 
You can't have all... People that just think in

24:11.230 --> 24:13.250
ten-year terms. You know what I mean? Think way out 
there. Or you wouldn't get today's problem.

24:25.970 --> 24:26.991
That's my line. What is your general assessment

24:26.970 --> 24:38.580
of that? You want to start there and then I'll ask 
the rest of them? Oh,

24:41.560 --> 24:46.550
ease is a benefit in that

24:46.530 --> 24:56.130
it is a place that has the flexibility to long-term 
ideas and to short-range needs. If a researcher

25:04.860 --> 25:07.440
comes in today and said, boy, if I could just do 
this, this, and this, then we'd have this research

25:11.760 --> 25:13.780
project and this would really help where we're 
going. It would help Texas A&M. It's really... We

25:17.760 --> 25:21.780
don't see ourselves as separate and apart. The 
people that work for us are both. I think that's...

25:25.880 --> 25:28.900
That's hard for administrators that are in charge 
of academics to realize sometimes. We're not

25:32.880 --> 25:34.900
trying to fight over who this person belongs to. 
We're just trying to support good programs. In

25:38.900 --> 25:40.920
fact, a lot of the programs that TEAS has developed 
traditionally have then become universal. There

25:46.900 --> 25:55.540
are things like that that initially were started 
by TEAS, either because TEAS had

25:58.520 --> 26:04.320
fiscal capability and flexibility, because it 
has a flexibility with this.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.900
The university has not felt it. And

26:18.880 --> 26:27.840
also, TEAS seems to me to be the place that's been 
able to take,

26:33.750 --> 26:34.771
yeah, let's try this. We'll try cyclotron. And 
then if it's not what we need, well, you know, there

26:38.750 --> 26:41.180
have been a lot of things that they've shut down. 
But it's a place where you can... That's what

26:45.760 --> 26:52.630
research...

26:52.610 --> 26:57.960
I think it's given the state very recently a 
capability and a... They didn't have to waste

27:02.200 --> 27:07.100
energy, time, and resources. They can draw upon

27:07.080 --> 27:12.480
something they've been in place for over 70 years. 
I think it will become more important in the next 20

27:21.150 --> 27:23.710
years than

27:23.690 --> 27:28.200
it has in the past, simply because if you will look 
at the scale, you can almost see an upturn. We have,

27:34.320 --> 27:36.340
in the last four years, grown at over 25% per year. 
Physically? Physically. There is a larger

27:41.970 --> 27:43.990
demand, and

27:43.970 --> 27:49.320
there is going to be a larger need for what in the 
future, especially

27:51.250 --> 27:55.880
in Texas. There needs to be a resource for those 
industries to draw on, for capable answers to

28:00.860 --> 28:06.340
questions, working relationships, and also at 20 
talent. What

28:09.320 --> 28:17.150
is the value of T's to basic science versus 
technology? I'm not sure that there is a

28:21.430 --> 28:26.800
difference. I'd be interested in your definition 
of difference. I'm not sure there's a difference

28:28.780 --> 28:31.240
either. Dr. Seeley is sure there's a difference, 
and he hasn't been able to, he hasn't been able to

28:34.220 --> 28:36.240
explain it to me well enough for me to understand it 
either. But to the extent that basic science is the

28:45.620 --> 28:51.510
theory upon technology. You've got to start it 
with a problem. To me, that's it. You have a

28:54.490 --> 28:55.511
problem, then you're working on something that's 
applied. I think there's research, and there's

29:01.490 --> 29:03.510
development. And I think that in the body of 
research, it's very hard to tell. Or generic.

29:12.062 --> 29:13.790
Because you may be working on, discover

29:13.770 --> 29:21.440
something that's very, not intentionally, but 
you can't prevent that from you. Also, you can be

29:25.140 --> 29:31.000
working to discover

29:30.980 --> 29:39.550
things that are of benefit.

29:39.530 --> 29:40.551
What you can say is, this is the research part, and 
this is the development.

29:48.770 --> 29:50.790
Is T's involved in both? T's was not involved in as 
much as it

29:53.770 --> 30:03.460
might be if it is a vehicle where when you discover 
something. Or we also are much more sophisticated

30:10.070 --> 30:17.120
in our

30:10.070 --> 30:17.120
trying to be aware of how that will benefit the 
researcher in the universe. An

30:20.100 --> 30:24.600
example is protein recently or something

30:24.580 --> 30:38.880
that there

30:38.860 --> 30:48.200
is a university more secure. Dan Davis negotiated 
a contract licensing agreement. And

30:56.200 --> 31:01.610
Jim is taking home a minimum of $200,000 a year for 
the next year. And probably, the estimates on a max

31:08.570 --> 31:10.590
would be $2 million a year. That same amount of 
money comes back to him. But that's development.

31:21.460 --> 31:24.720
And we help with that. But the research is really 
important. Some

31:26.700 --> 31:35.330
people have said basic research is what you do. 
Well, the pure science, I think, versus the

31:39.460 --> 31:43.420
engineering, I think, is... In

31:44.400 --> 31:48.900
the end, what I get from the survey, I say, show me 
what the difference is. Because I can take him into

31:52.880 --> 31:54.900
some laboratories. The

31:54.880 --> 31:58.550
Zachry building, there are far more pure science 
than most of the things you'll find in the

32:00.530 --> 32:01.551
chemistry. They're physics. They're 
solid-state electronics. But that's... It's

32:06.243 --> 32:06.850
back to the interdisciplinary

32:06.830 --> 32:12.178
thing. I don't know that. Is there anything else 
you'd like to add to this? I should know that

32:16.010 --> 32:28.480
I

32:16.010 --> 32:28.480
don't know or that I haven't asked. You will run 
across the difficulty of calling it up to

32:33.380 --> 32:41.590
give you the answer. I don't know all

32:42.570 --> 32:50.780
the answers, but I can point you in the right 
direction.
