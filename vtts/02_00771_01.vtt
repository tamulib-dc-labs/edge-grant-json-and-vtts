WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:10.746
It's real hard to just strike out and say, we're 
going to do this. And it's hard to explain, I think,

00:12.909 --> 00:27.051
to the average citizen how engineering research 
affects their lives until you can give them some

00:12.909 --> 00:27.051
concrete examples. And so what we've tried to do is 
put it in language and explain it, especially to

00:27.183 --> 00:44.981
the legislature, what it is we do and how it has an 
impact on

00:27.183 --> 00:44.981
the future. Isn't Invent kind of targeted to the 
individuals? Exactly. Doesn't matter where, you

00:48.724 --> 00:55.671
know, anybody, anywhere, you have an idea and you 
send it in and it will be reviewed The success ratio

00:56.427 --> 01:05.440
in selection is very small because most things 
have been thought of before or have been done

00:56.427 --> 01:05.440
better already. But it gives you an opportunity to 
find out for no charge if there's a potential for

01:05.981 --> 01:23.186
something that will... We're primarily targeted 
at things that will create more jobs in the state.

01:23.306 --> 01:24.848
Either enhance the productivity or the product 
line of businesses already in existence and or

01:25.199 --> 01:39.657
create new businesses that will hire people. How 
does the Research Foundation and TEAS work

01:39.677 --> 01:45.144
together? The Research Foundation is an entity 
that

01:53.566 --> 01:57.452
all of our federal companies right now. To give you 
an example of what they, how they function, we

01:59.055 --> 02:15.863
cannot, we can buy a boat or a vessel for 
environmental engineering to use to do their

01:59.055 --> 02:15.863
research with, but we can't purchase the 
insurance. State entities can't buy insurance.

02:18.187 --> 02:23.755
They just, well, if you try to insure all these 
buildings, you give them a bill for a building a

02:18.187 --> 02:23.755
year for their premiums. And so it's a good fiscal 
policy, except under certain circumstances. And

02:28.362 --> 02:33.970
so there is a need to have a vehicle that can do those 
kinds of things for you. So they serve special

02:33.990 --> 02:36.574
purpose needs. And in the past, they have also than 
an awful lot of the proposal preparation and the

02:39.095 --> 02:54.693
budget advisement and contract negotiations for 
various major contracts with especially the

02:39.095 --> 02:54.693
federal government. And at one point, they were 
almost one and the same thing for a while in the 60s.

02:57.917 --> 02:59.259
There wasn't much separation. They've been 
fairly well separated since the late 70s, haven't

02:59.279 --> 03:03.163
they? As far as I know, they were very distinct 
operations when I came to work. and have probably

03:08.947 --> 03:38.346
grown more distinct as opposed to a lot of the 
services we are able to do

03:08.947 --> 03:38.346
sometimes easier or quicker or better or what we 
find we have to justify to the researcher that

03:08.947 --> 03:38.346
we're purchasing a service we want to send your 
contract through the research foundation and

03:08.947 --> 03:38.346
we've got to make sure that the researcher gets his 
that we're being cost-effective.

03:50.141 --> 03:58.914
During your short stint here, what has been the 
biggest period of change in TEAS? Oh, I think the

03:58.934 --> 04:08.367
fact that Skip was director has changed the whole 
perspective of the agency. And that it was

04:09.612 --> 04:25.663
much more aggressively tuned to serving

04:09.612 --> 04:25.663
the state and meeting the nation's problems. We 
found that so many people... T's had been a passive

04:25.964 --> 04:32.070
organization. Responsive, but passive, I think, 
in the past. And we found that many people who

04:36.395 --> 04:54.773
didn't know that it existed and that it could 
provide statewide service might have been on the

04:36.395 --> 04:54.773
way to creating another entity that was a state 
agency to do exactly what we were chartered to do

04:36.395 --> 04:54.773
initially. And so, with that

04:55.175 --> 05:11.980
threat or possibility in her, we realized that we 
really did exist and we did have a state charter. We

05:12.020 --> 05:16.086
were not just here to serve Texas A&M University. 
We were a college station. We were here to serve the

05:17.738 --> 05:20.602
state of Texas. And we can do that here. This is a 
good place to do it. We're structured well to do

05:23.827 --> 05:25.449
that. We just needed to be more open with state and 
public officials in saying that we recognize our

05:25.469 --> 05:37.607
state charter and we're interested in working on 
state problems. Do you think there was national

05:37.667 --> 05:41.112
emphasis before? has always been in securing 
contracts. We've always worked on a national

05:44.138 --> 05:52.452
basis as far as liaison with meeting Air Force and 
DOD and those kinds of But I think that Texas is in

05:54.035 --> 06:00.403
the limelight now. We are what's going to happen to 
the nation in many respects. The problems that you

06:04.328 --> 06:08.113
address here are also the problems of the nation. 
And so it's just become very focused. And so by

06:14.742 --> 06:19.047
doing more, most often we do it. Were there any 
particular critical turning points besides, was

06:19.955 --> 06:29.066
there a time that you felt TEAS was threatened 
because of these new organizations? Well? I don't

06:32.069 --> 06:37.595
know if there was any particular piece of 
legislation threatened. It didn't get quite as

06:38.476 --> 06:43.262
far as legislation, but The governor's 
commission, Governor Plymouth set up the Texas

06:43.529 --> 06:55.041
2000 and early on, I'd have to stop to get documents 
for you, but we'll do that later. Porter went over

07:01.706 --> 07:08.176
to participate in the engineering extension 
service staff development conference. And one of

07:08.196 --> 07:17.230
the speakers was Vic Arnold, and he was quoted from 
part of the research that he had done as director of

07:08.196 --> 07:17.230
the Texas 2000. It stated that there is no state 
agency to do R&D in the state of Texas. And we're

07:24.282 --> 07:34.174
sitting over here doing, we started TTI and we're 
doing about $24 million worth of research per

07:24.282 --> 07:34.174
year. And so we thought maybe we might need to go 
talk to this person and let him know that we exist.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.724
And so we did that. And actually it's one of the 
recommendations initially. They were going to

07:47.429 --> 07:52.956
recommend that there be a state agency created to 
do research and development technology. We were

07:57.494 --> 08:05.144
invited to make a presentation to the 
subcommittee on research and development for the

07:57.494 --> 08:05.144
Texas 2000. This was Paul Thayer while he was still 
president of LTV before he became president of the

08:05.164 --> 08:14.756
National Chamber of Commerce. He went to some 
government position too. A.B. Holliday, she's

08:21.339 --> 08:25.426
the largest realtor in the world. That's like 27 
offices in the Dallas area. Just a wide variety of

08:28.551 --> 08:30.394
people. I think Dean Rostow from the LBJ School in 
UT Austin. Harvey McManus from the Institute of

08:40.211 --> 08:45.420
Constructive Capitalism. but a wide variety of 
people on this panel. And we went and told them what

08:50.061 --> 09:13.635
the Engineering Experiment Station did and 
described to them the concept of Invent, which was

08:50.061 --> 09:13.635
just then coming up as a way to address the needs of 
the Joe Blow on the street in dealing with the

08:50.061 --> 09:13.635
ideas, how to spur entrepreneurism, and how to get 
every person to see that there is a need for R&D in

09:14.729 --> 09:25.699
their activities and that they can have a good idea 
and somebody can help them with that. The final

09:25.899 --> 09:36.789
recommendation and the target that you guys were 
looking for was that there be the Institute for

09:25.899 --> 09:36.789
Ventures and New Technology, which changed names 
about six times in that process. We had to call them

09:36.809 --> 09:40.433
all the time to tell them what we were calling it 
that week. It serves as a prototype. for similar

09:43.585 --> 09:48.450
types of efforts. And there wasn't a 
recommendation to create a new state agency to do

09:48.470 --> 09:52.774
R&D. That's probably the closest that I... Was 
there recognition by them that A&M existed for

09:53.154 --> 10:02.463
R&D? Oh, well, with the invent statement, yeah. 
That was a major coup, I think, because these

10:05.826 --> 10:13.153
were... people in Austin that had worked for UT 
before and went to work on this project and went

10:13.420 --> 10:23.715
back to work for UT as Director of Bureau of 
Business Research afterwards. So it opened their

10:25.037 --> 10:30.625
eyes a lot. Is that the most successful period? 
Well, I think we're getting in vent past. I really

10:36.754 --> 10:41.942
don't think that people internally had as much 
confidence as people externally had that

10:42.648 --> 10:55.857
legislation would pass in a very hectic session 
and that funding would be secure.

10:58.723 --> 11:02.732
We got a million dollars in a very, very tight time. 
fiscal biennium. And the Legislative Budget

11:06.091 --> 11:28.804
Board didn't recommend any money for it because 
they felt like the legislature needed to say this

11:06.091 --> 11:28.804
was something so new and so different that they had 
to have the whole House and Senate vote on it to

11:06.091 --> 11:28.804
demonstrate that this was the expenditure of 
money for the public good. Because it was, it

11:29.054 --> 11:33.499
created a precedent that had not existed before. 
There is state law that says you cannot spend

11:33.519 --> 11:40.728
money, you can't give money to a private 
individual. We couldn't invest in private, for

11:41.489 --> 11:44.373
private money. We had to invest for the public 
good. And we had to then do, our legislation, what

11:46.495 --> 11:57.829
it really says is that we agree that the Institute 
for Business and Technology exists for the public

11:46.495 --> 11:57.829
good of the state. And even though it helps 
individual people, that's going to benefit the

11:58.282 --> 12:03.531
whole state in the long run. By creating more jobs? 
Exactly. And so that bill did not pass

12:06.516 --> 12:15.050
until May 26th. The session was over very shortly 
thereafter. And at the last minute, was added, the

12:21.822 --> 12:27.127
money was added as a rider in the appropriations 
bill. To pay, to give us money to operate that on.

12:33.352 --> 12:36.655
That was a major turning point, I think. I'm trying 
to think if there have been others, because it

12:37.416 --> 12:43.301
seems like there have. Here, it's just one turning 
point after another. I think that another turning

12:46.904 --> 12:51.728
point is our working relationships and our our 
cooperative agreements, move to the distributed

12:52.180 --> 13:02.131
industrial research centers, if that's what 
we're going to call it. So that that will be a

13:02.151 --> 13:07.817
milestone with you. Is there a project that you 
think T should have pursued that they didn't? Oh,

13:12.001 --> 13:14.904
there's a lot of those.

13:21.171 --> 13:22.052
We're still working to

13:23.348 --> 13:36.199
find ways to work with Mexico and Canada to 
establish international ties and linkages. And

13:36.219 --> 13:39.522
that just doesn't happen overnight. It's going to 
take a long time. When did that process begin? Oh,

13:42.965 --> 13:49.250
again, I think that was a mindset that we all felt 
comfortable with when we came in. It hadn't

13:49.270 --> 13:51.112
started before that time? Well, there had been... 
I think Vincent will tell you there have been . It's

13:58.490 --> 14:11.450
just something that we're just now beginning to 
see the real importance of recognizing we're in a

13:58.490 --> 14:11.450
global

13:58.490 --> 14:11.450
economy and participating on an international 
basis. The effort you're making right now is

14:11.470 --> 14:17.299
within the continent, right? Yeah. You

14:18.175 --> 14:26.784
had made a comment about the role of TEAS in 
education and the engineers. Can you expand any

14:26.885 --> 14:33.512
more on what you think that role is and how it has 
changed if it has changed? Well, we're evolving

14:33.532 --> 14:44.564
another, I don't know if it will ever become a 
division, but it's a laboratory center called the

14:33.532 --> 14:44.564
Learning Technology Center. And this is a way to 
link engineers and educators. to work on the

14:47.943 --> 14:52.470
question of how people learn. And I think 
technology is a tool that I don't know that current

14:52.490 --> 15:10.959
theory on learning is transferable to 
technological tools. I think you may learn very

15:10.979 --> 15:13.883
differently. using a terminal, using a video 
disk, using, you may not have to be in a particular

15:14.318 --> 15:25.495
building, you may not have to be in a particular 
place. Those flexibilities can change the

15:26.777 --> 15:38.494
educational environment and can change the whole 
educational process. Many people in public

15:38.514 --> 15:42.300
schools are adamantly opposed to that. because 
they aren't convinced that we'll do anything

15:43.276 --> 15:51.569
different. And much of what's been produced so far 
is not very good. We're just on the verge

15:56.176 --> 16:06.972
of having anybody put together anything that 
doesn't want to just entertain you. It's as close

16:09.449 --> 16:14.658
to basic research as I have found that can be done. 
What about the role of the research and the

16:15.319 --> 16:24.716
aerodynamic research used in teaching 
aerodynamics here? Is there much interplay

16:24.736 --> 16:28.623
between those? Well, I think that...

16:33.091 --> 16:35.493
Let me see if I understand your question. Are you 
interested in how technology impacts teaching,

16:35.753 --> 16:39.417
aerodynamics? How research is going on at TEAS? Is 
it used in classroom instruction? You will find

16:48.826 --> 16:55.972
that 80% of our employees are faculty in Texas A&E. 
They're joint employees. We just buy out their

16:57.193 --> 16:58.695
time. It's really what it boils down to. The things 
they learn in the laboratory are immediately

17:03.382 --> 17:09.450
transferable to their classroom. And in fact, in a 
lot of cases, much of the work done in the

17:10.091 --> 17:15.278
laboratory is done by the graduate students. So 
it's a learning, what I hope evolves with our

17:15.358 --> 17:20.424
research part. And what I hope, what I think is 
going to happen to education. at the graduate

17:24.408 --> 17:28.173
level eventually, especially in the technical 
areas. It's like we have teaching hospitals for

17:28.754 --> 17:33.340
medicine and veterinary medicine right now. We 
have teaching companies that come and locate in

17:33.820 --> 17:47.699
research parks where not only do you have the 
laboratories where you're really doing the work

17:33.820 --> 17:47.699
and doing whatever it is the company does, but 
those become a learning mechanism. The buildings

17:48.400 --> 17:51.023
may have classrooms built right into them. And the 
people who are in industry also become

17:51.273 --> 18:00.406
instructors, teachers, or facilitators in that 
process.

18:03.070 --> 18:09.400
Which is, it's a way down the road, I think, but it's 
kind of awesome. The research part that you're

18:10.161 --> 18:17.511
talking about, how is that, what is the status of 
that at this point? As far as I know, They have

18:18.914 --> 18:26.226
selected the A&E firm, architecture and 
engineering firm, that's going to do the

18:18.914 --> 18:26.226
construction of the streets, sewers. They've got 
to get all the utilities set up. You wouldn't...

18:30.853 --> 18:33.237
But they do have funding to construct it. They're 
going to do that. I think they've appropriated

18:34.319 --> 18:36.783
probably about $7 million. Is it state funding? 
Well, it's available fund money. What they're

18:42.892 --> 18:44.635
going to do is... you know, you wouldn't go buy a lot 
in a subdivision if it didn't have a road, if it

18:45.492 --> 18:56.383
didn't have a sewer, if it didn't have water and 
utilities, and you didn't know how much it cost. So

18:56.403 --> 19:00.067
they're in the process of getting that. But they 
have committed themselves, TEAS has committed

19:00.087 --> 19:03.690
themselves to doing this? Now it's the university 
that's actually the person. It's not going to be a

19:06.633 --> 19:07.854
TEAS? No, we're connected to it in that we're 
supportive of it, but it's actually, there's a

19:07.874 --> 19:15.482
vice chancellor for the Research Park and 
Corporate Relations, named Mark Mooney, and he

19:16.441 --> 19:21.548
reports to the Chancellor. So it's really a system 
project. Which he's only been part of. Yeah.

19:31.221 --> 19:41.315
How have external events affected your research,

19:31.221 --> 19:41.315
state or national? The economy? Oh, I think that 
we're I think external events affect us in that

19:43.255 --> 19:59.712
there are things that need to be done in research 
areas that sometimes are easier to quote unquote

19:43.255 --> 19:59.712
sell based upon what happens in the outside world. 
people become much more receptive to education

20:00.012 --> 20:24.872
technology since nation at risk came out since the 
national reports have come out since we've had the

20:00.012 --> 20:24.872
governor's report on education okay that is a 
topic that will be hopefully the legislature will

20:00.012 --> 20:24.872
be receptive to when you go back next time but 
they're receptive to their problems and what we

20:00.012 --> 20:24.872
try to do is anticipate what the problems are, and 
already have research teams in place or the

20:25.595 --> 20:37.687
beginnings of that put together so that we can 
respond.

20:40.991 --> 20:51.822
Our best bet is if we can anticipate the problem 
before they do, before they begin to feel, so that

20:40.991 --> 20:51.822
we can respond by saying, yes, we're working in 
that area, here's what we can do for you. So what we

20:52.477 --> 20:54.199
do, we work in the future. We work on things that 
haven't been done before. That's Mars. Figure out

20:57.742 --> 20:58.983
what it is next. So you've done that with education 
in terms of the start. Are there any other things

21:02.167 --> 21:05.770
that you know of since you've been here? Oh, sure. 
Space, the space technology effort and space

21:06.110 --> 21:11.716
exploitation and commercialization. Doreen can 
tell you much more about that. But what we did, we do

21:14.138 --> 21:17.101
program reviews once a year. We sit down with every 
division head. and talk about what they have done,

21:19.190 --> 21:26.399
what they want to do, what their major problems 
are, where they see research going. And a

21:27.060 --> 21:35.390
recurring theme here before last was that there's 
going to be a renewed emphasis in space. But with a

21:36.632 --> 21:41.518
different, not just in getting there and getting 
back, but what do you do once you're there. And so we

21:42.258 --> 21:53.438
began to join that area and began to put together 
some effort and some research activities there,

21:42.258 --> 21:53.438
some planning. And it's been since then that the 
president has come out and said, we're going to

21:53.458 --> 22:02.674
have a station. And that... There has been private 
companies spring up that are trying to launch

22:06.187 --> 22:14.458
their own rockets and go into business because 
they think there's going to be a profit. That

22:15.339 --> 22:23.230
NASA's thinking about turning the shuttle over to 
some private contractor for a commercial

22:15.339 --> 22:23.230
operation. So that they anticipate it. All we have 
to do a lot of times is listen. You just have to keep

22:29.198 --> 22:34.725
your ear to the ground to figure out what it is 
that's going to be on the floor. Who do you listen

22:35.161 --> 22:37.185
to? Researchers and...

22:37.205 --> 22:42.935
Well, yes and no. People. You can read, you know, 
you can follow a chain of events and just kind of

22:44.639 --> 22:50.490
begin to see. If you think far enough... you think 
that in itself is a skill to oh yeah yeah i read

22:56.221 --> 23:21.115
something recently that described it really well 
and this psychologist or sociologist said that

22:56.221 --> 23:21.115
there are one-year people and there are 10-year 
people and five-year people he said some people if

22:56.221 --> 23:21.115
you're a one-year person you can only think in 
one-year time frame and you think everybody else

22:56.221 --> 23:21.115
thinks that way too mom i i have always

23:24.487 --> 23:25.388
well, for a long time. I don't guess I was aware of 
it, but for a long time I've known that I think of

23:25.408 --> 23:43.684
ideas and can go ahead and get them in place, but 
they may not be really implemented and used for

23:25.408 --> 23:43.684
three, four, five, ten years. Come up with 
products for others. Yeah, it just happens that,

23:48.288 --> 23:53.633
you know,

23:48.288 --> 23:53.633
the The use and application and receptivity to 
some of that stuff just takes longer for other

23:55.402 --> 24:05.631
people to become comfortable with. But you've got 
to have all of those kinds of people. You can't have

24:09.975 --> 24:13.238
all people that just think in tenured terms. I 
mean, think way out there. Or you wouldn't get

24:15.480 --> 24:18.503
today's problem solved. But in terms of planning 
programs. Yeah.

24:24.410 --> 24:25.872
This is a biggie. This is my life. What is your 
general assessment of the value of TEAS to A&M,

24:27.113 --> 24:37.785
to the state, to the nation, to the world? You want 
to start there and then I'll ask the rest of them?

24:44.954 --> 24:53.083
TEAS is a benefit to Texas A&M University that 
Texas A&M University does not really realize, I

24:44.954 --> 24:53.083
think. and that it is a place that has the 
flexibility to respond to long-term ideas and to

24:53.519 --> 25:05.244
short-range needs. If a researcher comes in today 
and says, boy, if I could just do this, this, and

25:09.483 --> 25:15.232
this, then we'd have this research project, and 
this would really help where we're going. It would

25:15.252 --> 25:18.037
help Texas A&M. We don't see ourselves as separate 
and apart. The people who work for us are both. I

25:24.407 --> 25:34.984
think that's hard for administrators that are in 
charge of academics to realize sometimes, is

25:24.407 --> 25:34.984
we're not trying to fight over. who this person 
belongs to. We're just trying to support good

25:37.259 --> 25:39.542
programs. In fact, a lot of the programs that TEAS 
has developed traditionally have then become

25:39.622 --> 25:49.453
university properties, so to speak. The 
cyclotron, the data processing center. There are

25:54.018 --> 26:01.326
things like that that initially were started by 
TEAS, either because TEAS had

26:03.685 --> 26:22.033
fiscal capability and flexibility, because it 
has a flexibility with its financial status that

26:03.685 --> 26:22.033
the university has not felt

26:03.685 --> 26:22.033
it had, I think, sometimes. And also, T seems to me 
to be the place that's been able to take a

26:22.053 --> 26:31.667
calculated risk. and say, yeah, let's try this. 
We'll try cyclotron and then if it's not what we

26:35.118 --> 26:43.429
need, well, you know, there have been a lot of 
things that they've shut down. But it's a place

26:44.210 --> 26:48.356
where you can, that's what research is all about.

26:52.361 --> 27:01.654
I think it's given the state very recently a 
capability and a They didn't have to waste energy,

27:02.343 --> 27:07.068
time, and resources going to create something 
like this. They can draw

27:07.088 --> 27:17.518
upon something they've been in place for 70 years. 
I think it will become more important to the state

27:17.538 --> 27:30.932
in

27:17.538 --> 27:30.932
the next 20 years than it has in the past simply 
because if you will look at the scale You can almost

27:32.633 --> 27:34.556
see an upturn. We have, in the last four years, 
grown at over 25% per year. Fiscally? Fiscally.

27:42.026 --> 27:54.102
There is a larger demand for what we do, and there is 
going to be a larger need for what we do in the

27:42.026 --> 27:54.102
future, especially in Texas. We're going to 
become a high technology state. There needs to be a

27:55.965 --> 28:01.392
resource for those industries to draw on, for... 
capable answers to questions, working

28:03.245 --> 28:14.476
relationships, and also at trained

28:03.245 --> 28:14.476
talent. What is the value of T's to basic science 
research versus technology research? I'm not

28:22.985 --> 28:27.009
sure that there is a difference. I'd be interested 
in your definition of what I'm not sure there's a

28:29.620 --> 28:31.184
difference. Dr. Seeley is sure there's a definite 
difference, and he hasn't been able to explain it

28:31.204 --> 28:39.285
to me well enough for me to understand it either. 
But to the extent that... basic science is the

28:44.740 --> 28:51.026
theory upon which you build the reality of 
technology. Sure, but you've got to start it with a

28:51.046 --> 28:53.449
problem. Right. Okay, and to me that's if you have a 
problem then you're working on something that's

28:53.609 --> 28:59.975
applied before you can get into the basics. I think 
there's research and there's development. Okay.

29:03.319 --> 29:09.685
And I think that in the body of research it's very 
hard to tell what's basic and applied. or generic,

29:10.053 --> 29:21.390
because you may be working on a particular 
application to discover something that's very

29:10.053 --> 29:21.390
generic in its nature that applies to you. Not 
intentionally, but you can prevent that from

29:21.410 --> 29:24.254
happening. Also, you can be working on something 
very basic, but the purpose of basic research is to

29:25.096 --> 29:34.710
discover things that are of benefit, which means 
they have application. you can't structure it

29:35.062 --> 29:39.166
where you do one or the other. What you can say is 
this is the research part and this is the

29:39.426 --> 29:44.230
development. This is where I take it to the 
marketplace. So is TEAS involved in both? TEAS was

29:50.796 --> 30:03.408
not involved in the marketing or the 
commercialization as much in the past as it might

29:50.796 --> 30:03.408
be in the future through Inven. Inven is a vehicle 
where when you discover something you can do that.

30:08.303 --> 30:21.942
Or we also are much more sophisticated in our

30:08.303 --> 30:21.942
trying to be aware of how that will benefit the 
researcher and the university and the state. An

30:23.084 --> 30:32.457
example is there's a researcher in food protein 
who recently discovered a patentable process for

30:34.900 --> 30:46.719
I don't know what it is, but something that works 
with

30:34.900 --> 30:46.719
privacy. There is a university system patent 
office. The patent was secured. Dan Davis

30:53.390 --> 30:59.040
negotiated a contract licensing agreement with a 
company from Japan. And Jim Mahon's taking home a

31:02.913 --> 31:10.161
minimum of $200,000 a year for the next two years, 
and probably the estimates on a max would be $2

31:02.913 --> 31:10.161
million a year. That same amount of money comes 
back to the university system or to TEAS as a system

31:11.202 --> 31:17.749
part, since that's where it gets work. But that's 
development, and we help with that. But the

31:24.817 --> 31:27.520
research is really important. I'd be interested 
in Dr. Seymour's definition. Some people have

31:35.054 --> 31:38.640
said basic research is what you do when you don't 
know what you're doing. Well, the pure science, I

31:38.660 --> 31:48.395
think, versus the engineering, I think, is

31:38.660 --> 31:48.395
the difference. In that standpoint, I'd be from 
Missouri. I'd say, show me what the difference is.

31:52.301 --> 31:57.068
Because I can take him into some laboratories 
and... The Zachry building, there are far more

31:58.364 --> 32:05.672
pure science than most of the things you'll find in 
the chemistry department. They're physics.

32:06.413 --> 32:08.936
They're solid state electronics, but that's 
physics.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.623
And it's back to the interdisciplinary question. 
And I don't know that you can pull it apart that

32:14.643 --> 32:22.532
much.

32:22.652 --> 32:23.713
It'll be interesting to see.

32:28.064 --> 32:41.577
Is there anything else you'd like to add to this 
that you think I should know that I don't know or

32:28.064 --> 32:41.577
that I haven't

32:28.064 --> 32:41.577
asked? You will run across the

32:41.597 --> 32:51.327
demo as you go along. Let me know if there's 
questions. I'd like to feel free to call you up

32:53.288 --> 32:55.931
again. I don't know all the answers, but I can point 
you to the right questions. Thank you very much.
