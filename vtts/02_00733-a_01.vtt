00:03.963 --> 00:23.704
OK. First of all, Mr. Dunn, would you tell us 
something about your early life, including the

00:03.963 --> 00:23.704
names of your parents, the dates of their birth and 
death, if you know them, where they were born,

00:03.963 --> 00:23.704
where you were born, and the schools you attended 
before you entered Texas A&M? Well, my father was

00:23.724 --> 00:30.932
born in Arkansas,

00:23.724 --> 00:30.932
in Dallark. and came to Texas and settled around 
near Lancaster, Texas, south of Dallas. And at an

00:44.410 --> 01:01.948
age, when he was about 12 years old, with his 
father, he was orphaned at a young age and grew up on

00:44.410 --> 01:01.948
a farm in Dallas County.

01:04.325 --> 01:15.240
went to work for the postal system and worked in the 
postal system until his death in 1936 at the age of

01:04.325 --> 01:15.240
57. My mother... Your father's name? My father's 
name was Charles Allen Dunn. My mother was born

01:25.514 --> 01:32.003
in...

01:38.311 --> 01:46.281
at Lavon near McKinney, Texas, Collin County, I 
believe. And was a one of large, one child of a large

01:46.302 --> 01:53.972
family. Her mother died when she was three years 
old and she was raised mostly by her aunt in the

02:09.226 --> 02:14.672
Rockwall County

02:09.226 --> 02:14.672
near Dallas. She

02:16.494 --> 02:36.297
taught school in a country school near Lancaster 
where she met my father and they were married in the

02:16.494 --> 02:36.297
year 1902.

02:39.230 --> 03:00.922
I was raised in Dallas and attended the grade 
school and the Oak Cliff High School in Dallas

02:39.230 --> 03:00.922
before I went to A&M.

03:03.486 --> 03:06.891
I had one brother and one sister. My brother 
graduated from Texas A&M in chemical

03:08.828 --> 03:24.721
engineering, and my sister attended CIA before 
her marriage.

03:27.324 --> 03:28.685
They are both deceased. My mother and father are 
both deceased, and I'm the only remaining member

03:39.018 --> 03:42.281
of the family still living. Could you tell us what 
was your mother's name? My mother's name was

03:44.643 --> 03:48.006
Charlotte Webb. And

03:50.508 --> 04:03.320
she always told me that I was going to A&M and I 
didn't know there was any other school. But when I

04:04.661 --> 04:07.624
left to go go to college, I had $100 in my pocket and 
somehow managed to graduate

04:07.840 --> 04:29.494
in mechanical engineering four years later with 
about $1,500 in the bank.

04:35.178 --> 04:38.242
Is that enough for the background? You mentioned 
the fact that your mother had always said you were

04:38.342 --> 04:41.806
going to A&M. I was going to ask you what factors 
were involved in your choice of A&M. It looks as

04:46.152 --> 04:48.135
though your mother chose the school for you. Well, 
my brother had entered A&M two years before, and I

04:49.336 --> 05:04.155
didn't know anything about any other school.

05:04.422 --> 05:22.705
The reason my mother said I was going to A&M, she 
didn't know how we could pay for it, but she was so

05:04.422 --> 05:22.705
determined that I get an education that she always 
told me that I'd be able to work it out, which I did.

05:24.808 --> 05:32.117
What were the procedures which you went through to 
enter A&M?

05:33.211 --> 05:53.351
I don't recall anything except getting off of the 
H&TC train about 4 o'clock in the morning in

05:33.211 --> 05:53.351
College Station and

05:33.211 --> 05:53.351
waiting until time to go to the registration 
office. In those days, I don't believe we had the

05:54.091 --> 05:59.877
formal application and acceptance, I did have my 
high school record and was enrolled the day I

06:00.751 --> 06:15.253
arrived. Then you arrived there just in time for 
the classes to start in the fall, I would take it.

06:20.781 --> 06:21.342
Yes. What were your first reactions to the college 
and to the community of College Station when you

06:23.093 --> 06:30.063
arrived there at 4 o'clock in the morning? Or I 
guess that's kind of difficult to ask you what your

06:30.664 --> 06:38.054
reactions were at that time, but your immediate 
reactions to the school once you got there. It was

06:38.295 --> 06:40.137
all very strange to me. I'd never seen the school, 
although my brother had been there two years. And

06:45.465 --> 06:49.911
it was a rather lonesome feeling.

06:50.701 --> 06:54.746
I believe it was the farthest I'd ever been away 
from home.

07:00.414 --> 07:13.772
But I immediately began to

07:00.414 --> 07:13.772
get familiar with the

07:19.996 --> 07:25.484
habits then that were predominant. The freshman 
wasn't long in finding out his place on the campus

07:26.465 --> 07:34.336
and was kept busy. I didn't, my first trip home was 
for the Christmas holidays. So during that period

07:44.830 --> 07:48.315
of time, if I had not been as busy as I was trying to 
pay off the note I made with the college to enroll.

07:56.536 --> 08:12.392
In those days, we had no student loan funds, but the 
college would accept your note provided you

07:56.536 --> 08:12.392
paid it all off before you enrolled the next 
semester. So I went to the student labor people

08:18.198 --> 08:34.558
obtained work at 25 cents an hour, which included 
cleaning out the horse barns and picking up papers

08:18.198 --> 08:34.558
and trash on the campus and chopping weeds and so 
forth. And that was in the beginning before I was

08:34.578 --> 08:43.489
able to obtain a regular job. Now, my first job 
which I kept three years, was waiting on tables in

08:46.700 --> 08:52.308
the mess hall. It paid about $20 a month in those 
days and almost paid for my entire expense for a

08:52.328 --> 09:05.646
college board and room.

09:10.974 --> 09:15.340
But after that, I began to get other jobs lined up. 
Were there limitations on the number of hours you

09:15.758 --> 09:18.522
could work a week? No. You could work any time you 
weren't in class.

09:28.215 --> 09:28.375
OK. This money which you earned, did the school pay 
that to you and then you repay it to the school? Or

09:33.763 --> 09:35.925
did they just deduct it from your account that you? 
They just credited to my note. I never saw any

09:39.110 --> 09:40.131
money. Until you didn't see anything. You had the 
note all paid off then. Yes. OK. Would you describe

09:45.661 --> 10:04.525
a typical day from, say, the time you got up in the 
morning and the procedure of getting up,

09:45.661 --> 10:04.525
approximately how many hours you spent in class a 
day, what you did on your other activities, and

09:45.661 --> 10:04.525
then the procedure for going to bed and what time 
you went to bed? Well, of course, that varied. I

10:08.711 --> 10:14.318
worked all of my spare time. But the

10:15.580 --> 10:21.949
schedules were irregular. The days you had lab 
work, you had more hours. And the day you had just

10:25.134 --> 10:28.859
regular classes, you had less. And then

10:30.301 --> 10:44.862
I

10:30.301 --> 10:44.862
had to get up around 6.30 in the morning in order to 
get to the mess hall. on time in those days. We had

10:50.438 --> 11:08.375
when you got this mess hall job was one of the most 
sought after employment job because it didn't

10:50.438 --> 11:08.375
take time except just before and during mealtime.

11:10.797 --> 11:14.781
The rule was that if As many as three of the waiters 
were absent at any one meal, they all lost their

11:16.263 --> 11:24.310
job. But if one or two was absent, then they didn't 
lose their job. But I couldn't take a chance on

11:33.918 --> 11:38.081
losing my job, so I was always present. And then 
classes, first class would start at 8 o'clock, and

11:46.925 --> 12:04.010
on the days that we had the lab work, why, sometimes 
they'd run as late as 5, with some hours off in

11:46.925 --> 12:04.010
between, some time off in between. And then we had

12:05.753 --> 12:13.084
quarter quarters at 7.30.

12:15.427 --> 12:24.519
And in those days, every student had to be in his 
room at 7.30 and could not be out for any purpose

12:15.427 --> 12:24.519
without a pass. And this

12:26.882 --> 12:36.675
was very strict discipline administered by the 
upperclassmen in the dormitory. Who could issue

12:36.695 --> 12:37.757
the pass? Your commanding officer in the 
dormitory. Your company commander. Yeah,

12:42.924 --> 12:43.965
that... That would be only for purposes like going 
to the library and other legitimate reasons. And

12:53.602 --> 12:58.567
you were not allowed to visit other rooms.

13:04.854 --> 13:10.020
So you either stayed in your room and studied, or 
you stayed in the room and looked at the walls. What

13:11.232 --> 13:19.764
about if you needed some help from somebody on, 
say, a particular problem that you had to work out

13:11.232 --> 13:19.764
in a chemistry class or something? Could you get 
permission to go to someone else in your class then

13:19.784 --> 13:25.672
for aid in working out the problem? Yes. Yes, you 
could. And there was always someone available,

13:28.335 --> 13:36.867
usually an upper student, who was willing to help 
you. Now, did you have... A guard patrolling the

13:41.320 --> 13:43.663
hallways? No, we did not have. The reason I ask is 
because at one point I believe they did. At one

13:50.651 --> 13:53.033
point, but that was before my time. Before your 
time. Okay. Then you said you got up about 6.30 and

13:56.597 --> 14:00.221
went to the mess hall. I take it then most of the 
fellow students got up after you did. Yes, they...

14:08.337 --> 14:18.566
I've forgotten whether breakfast is 7 or 7.30, but 
they had to march to the mess hall for all meals.

14:19.607 --> 14:36.522
Each company would

14:19.607 --> 14:36.522
respond to the bugle call for

14:19.607 --> 14:36.522
getting up call to formation and and then of course 
they had bugle call for call to quarters and for

14:37.801 --> 15:05.935
taps at night and after 11 o'clock your lights had 
to be out and they you weren't permitted except in

14:37.801 --> 15:05.935
special cases to keep them on after 11 o'clock if 
you had some studying that you hadn't gotten done.

15:12.322 --> 15:16.988
You've talked about working in the mess hall and 
marching there in formation. What was the food

15:17.268 --> 15:18.810
like in the mess hall? Well, it really wasn't bad, 
but you got a little tired of it, I guess, as they do

15:20.052 --> 15:28.382
even today. But there was plenty of food, and most 
all students

15:36.695 --> 15:47.109
did very well on the food because of the regular 
meals

15:36.695 --> 15:47.109
and sufficient amount of it. They gained weight 
very rapidly and we got along well. But there was a

15:51.976 --> 16:01.909
lot of complaining, griping about food at times 
because

15:51.976 --> 16:01.909
of the sameness of it. Did you have a pretty 
standard menu, same each week, or each day of each

16:03.070 --> 16:14.300
week, or did they kind of alter the, if you had, did 
you have steak on the same day every week, or? We

16:15.481 --> 16:18.824
never had steak, that I recall. But they had, of 
course, the training tables had steak, but I

16:20.225 --> 16:31.575
didn't have access to a training table until my 
junior year when I was on the cross-country team.

16:37.628 --> 16:52.904
But I'd say that all in all the food was very good and 
the proof of the pudding is that the students

16:37.628 --> 16:52.904
gained weight and kept in good condition. Well, I 
imagine they had plenty of physical exercise to

16:53.945 --> 16:59.310
help in keeping them in condition. Yes, plenty of 
exercise. Of course, on the drill fields and

17:02.656 --> 17:16.612
athletics and intramural activities gave 
everybody an opportunity to get plenty of

17:02.656 --> 17:16.612
exercise. Of course, in those days, you walked 
everywhere you went. No car was allowed on the

17:21.797 --> 17:24.120
campus. No marriage student was allowed to attend 
A&M.

17:32.137 --> 17:36.763
Everyone

17:32.137 --> 17:36.763
lived in the dormitory. Did anybody ride a 
bicycle? Yes, a few of the college professors did.

17:43.653 --> 17:44.434
No students, though? I don't recall any students 
having a bicycle. Well, I ask that for two reasons.

17:49.501 --> 17:57.452
Partly, today, of course, bicycles are very 
popular on campus, and we have an old picture or two

17:49.501 --> 17:57.452
showing the front of a dormitory that has a bicycle 
in it. Well, they could have been, but they weren't

17:58.799 --> 18:02.846
predominant in those days. What was life like in 
the dormitory? Well, during the

18:08.716 --> 18:23.001
periods when there was no quarter quarters, it got 
pretty noisy and rough at times. The boys amused

18:23.943 --> 18:37.944
themselves in various ways, such as finding one of 
their classmates asleep in bed and drowning him

18:23.943 --> 18:37.944
out by pouring water on him. And there was a good 
deal of hell-raising during the hours that they

18:39.346 --> 18:48.540
weren't under restrictions. So the hours of 
restriction were after 7.30 in the evening? Yes,

18:51.765 --> 18:52.566
yes. earlier than that say between 6 30 in the 
morning and 7 30 in the evening they could do pretty

18:52.782 --> 19:22.435
well as they wanted to yes and they did and they did 
okay what dormitories did you live in if you can

18:52.782 --> 19:22.435
remember yes i can remember i uh my freshman year i 
lived on the fourth stoop of old foster hall there

18:52.782 --> 19:22.435
was only about three rooms on the fourth stoop i 
remember the bath and the The shower and the

19:22.870 --> 19:38.028
bathrooms were on the first floor, and so I had to go 
up and down those steps

19:22.870 --> 19:38.028
to take my shower and back up to my room. But there 
was some advantage in living up there in the small

19:39.530 --> 19:43.956
area. There wasn't quite as much activity. In my 
sophomore year, I lived in the Bazell Hall. Now,

19:54.089 --> 20:02.677
A&M has, at many times during its history, faced 
housing shortages. In my freshman year and my

20:03.839 --> 20:12.167
sophomore year, I lived in the room with two other 
students, three in a room. And then my junior year,

20:13.648 --> 20:23.438
there wasn't any housing at all in

20:13.648 --> 20:23.438
the dormitories for some of the companies and my 
company, Company E Infantry, was put in army

20:24.042 --> 20:34.174
tents. And then a few, two or three months after 
that, they had built the shacks, they called them.

20:46.148 --> 20:51.735
In place of the canvas, they had built wooden 
shacks. We had wood-burning

20:53.759 --> 21:01.833
stoves with the smokestack up through the middle. 
We had a light cord with a bulb on the end of it, a

21:02.855 --> 21:14.715
kitchen table, and two kitchen chairs,

21:02.855 --> 21:14.715
but only two to a shack. Were these what was known as 
the Hollywood shacks? Yes. They were all wood

21:18.061 --> 21:19.243
then? Not in the beginning. There were 16-foot 
square army tents with a wooden floor, and then

21:21.789 --> 21:34.583
later on they built the shacks on the same floor. At 
one time they all had canvas tents with, I guess,

21:34.603 --> 21:43.552
dirt floors, and then later they had some wooden 
walls with canvas roofs. Well, I went through

21:44.293 --> 21:47.276
that, but never a dirt floor. It was a... That was 
about 1910, I believe. Well, that was before my

21:50.212 --> 21:52.475
time. But in my time, when I recall

21:53.115 --> 22:14.119
these housing situations when I was in school and I 
look at this beautiful dormitory that has my name

21:53.115 --> 22:14.119
on it, I see that we've come a long way. Yes, we have. 
Where did you live your senior year? My senior year

22:18.202 --> 22:24.088
I lived in Mitchell Hall in a corner basement room. 
Did you ever have any problem with bugs or anything

22:26.291 --> 22:30.435
like that in your rooms? Well,

22:30.455 --> 22:46.993
there were some

22:30.455 --> 22:46.993
times when the bugs were discovered in some of the 
dormitories and then the fumigation process took

22:47.277 --> 22:49.780
care of it. I was wondering, because you know 
Charlie Crawford. Yes. He was telling me about a

22:53.524 --> 23:01.272
problem he had with bugs in his room at one point and 
measures he took to keep them out of his room. Well,

23:01.552 --> 23:02.373
they weren't in his room. They were in somebody's 
room in his company, I think. Well, it happened on

23:06.978 --> 23:11.323
occasion while I was in school, but not in my room. 
And the school took pretty immediate measures to

23:12.044 --> 23:17.149
get rid of them, I take it, as soon as they were 
discovered. You mentioned earlier that the

23:19.222 --> 23:28.095
upperclassmen saw to it that you were busy and that 
you learned your place pretty quickly after you

23:19.222 --> 23:28.095
got there. Could you tell us a little bit about what 
privileges the upperclassmen did have over the

23:28.615 --> 23:38.369
freshmen, and what things they had you freshmen 
do? Well, I had the privilege of keeping three

23:38.389 --> 23:43.777
rooms in addition to my own in my freshman year. And 
the upperclassmen in those days would pick out a

23:49.124 --> 24:18.270
freshman and then you were known as their fish and 
of course you had a little problem in case their

23:49.124 --> 24:18.270
room did not pass room inspection as well as your 
own so when we got through with that breakfast

23:49.124 --> 24:18.270
before and before eight o'clock i had a very busy 
time of cleaning rooms These were three

24:19.398 --> 24:21.720
upperclassmen in your company? Yes. Three rooms. 
Three rooms. With two and sometimes as many as

24:25.783 --> 24:30.568
three in a room. So by keeping the room, this meant 
cleaning it, making up the bunk and everything?

24:35.432 --> 24:35.512
Yes.

24:38.454 --> 24:42.077
What else did you have to do for the upperclassmen? 
Run errands.

24:46.461 --> 24:48.763
And sometimes there were little burdensome, but 
you had to be ready to go when they wanted to send out

24:49.604 --> 25:12.844
for something or

24:49.604 --> 25:12.844
take their cleaning to Charlie Nitch's cleaning 
shop or whatever errands were to be done. I guess

25:13.398 --> 25:19.486
when you were there, they didn't have candy 
machines and soda machines quite as prolifically

25:13.398 --> 25:19.486
as they do today. No. When I was there, we either ate 
in the mess hall or at Casey's Confectionary.

25:31.661 --> 25:42.274
There was no place to buy food off the campus, no 
stores.

25:42.929 --> 26:08.407
went back and forth to Bryan when, on a few 
occasions, we went on the Tuna Vale Trolley, which

25:42.929 --> 26:08.407
was a little electrical railroad car, street car 
type thing, that was really a Tuna Vale Trolley,

25:42.929 --> 26:08.407
cost 15 cents each way, and I usually didn't have 
the 15 cents, and I had no reason to go to Bryan

25:42.929 --> 26:08.407
anyway. But the... as

26:14.435 --> 26:40.948
we had quite a bit of hazing in those days, and it was 
a question of learning to live with it and enjoy it,

26:14.435 --> 26:40.948
so to speak, and actually it...

26:42.582 --> 27:01.569
served to tie you closer to the

26:42.582 --> 27:01.569
students, although it was never

26:42.582 --> 27:01.569
justified. It was prevalent.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.325
Would you say that sometimes the upperclassmen 
abused the freshmen? Yes. Human nature is the same

27:12.626 --> 27:16.271
wherever you find it. And that was, I never knew of 
anyone getting hurt. But it was a pretty rough

27:21.738 --> 27:28.907
treatment at times. You indicated that if the 
upperclassman whose room you were keeping didn't

27:29.562 --> 27:40.572
pass inspection as well as your own, you were apt to 
get into trouble. Would this involve a leather

27:40.652 --> 27:44.836
strap in any way? Or what kind of trouble did you get 
into? Usually a board. A board. A fish paddle?

27:52.743 --> 27:52.843
Yeah. We've got a couple of those fish paddles in 
the archives.

27:59.465 --> 28:01.319
I think we're about at the end of this. Let me speed 
it up and get to the end.
