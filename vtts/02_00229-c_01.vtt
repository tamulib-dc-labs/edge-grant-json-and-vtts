WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:03.497
Bureau of Interior.

00:03.538 --> 00:04.058
CCC camp.

00:04.740 --> 00:15.119
And it was a time when one of the elections was coming up, and somebody said, how much did you give to the fund?

00:15.139 --> 00:16.842
I said, what are you talking about?

00:17.260 --> 00:21.184
Didn't you get a notice that you had to contribute to the political fund?

00:21.244 --> 00:24.888
This was for a state senator's fund, I think, from Massachusetts.

00:24.908 --> 00:25.148
Really?

00:25.168 --> 00:26.930
For the Democratic Party, naturally.

00:26.950 --> 00:27.070
Sure.

00:27.090 --> 00:28.732
In Massachusetts.

00:28.772 --> 00:38.222
And I said, no, I didn't get any notice, and they wouldn't believe me, because everybody had them, both the military and the civilians.

00:39.484 --> 00:42.006
Over in agriculture, we never had them.

00:42.026 --> 00:45.490
Same time, same state.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.491
That is interesting.

00:47.551 --> 00:50.475
Now, were you paid on the same level that they were paid?

00:50.936 --> 00:51.878
Oh, the military?

00:52.158 --> 00:53.480
No, as the CCC kids.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.462
No, no, no.

00:54.782 --> 00:58.828
Well, I was paid as a... They were paid about $20 a month, I think.

00:58.848 --> 01:04.497
Yeah, and I don't remember what I was getting, but I think it was equivalent of about $1,200 a year.

01:06.535 --> 01:11.342
something on that order, maybe a thousand, but anyway, I was paid as a forester.

01:11.362 --> 01:19.896
See, there were shortages of graduate foresters, and so they patched in with undergraduates.

01:19.916 --> 01:21.899
And did you eat with the CCC kids?

01:22.540 --> 01:22.820
Yes.

01:23.862 --> 01:25.945
And did you wear a uniform like they did?

01:26.802 --> 01:30.249
God, it's so far back that I don't remember what I wore, but I expect so.

01:30.490 --> 01:34.679
At least I wore whatever the foresters were wearing, I guess, green or something.

01:35.380 --> 01:40.350
And let's say you wanted to have a particular job done.

01:40.370 --> 01:46.363
Did they do the job for you, like to clear a certain piece of property or...

01:46.343 --> 01:56.058
or did you tell the officers, the first lieutenants in charge of the CCCs, and the CCC kids then carried it out, or how did it work?

01:56.198 --> 01:57.440
What was your relationship?

01:57.640 --> 01:59.744
Off the station, we were the boss.

01:59.764 --> 02:05.753
We got our orders from the Forest Service.

02:07.994 --> 02:12.439
Gardner or New Haven, depending on where it was.

02:13.320 --> 02:20.749
And it was straight line separation from the military on the work project.

02:20.769 --> 02:24.193
But we conformed to all the regulations in the camps.

02:25.614 --> 02:32.922
As far as work hours, as far as when I stayed in the camps, just wait.

02:32.943 --> 02:35.145
They ran with me.

02:35.165 --> 02:36.887
Give me sort of a daily routine.

02:37.947 --> 02:39.470
In the CCC's?

02:39.610 --> 02:39.891
Yeah.

02:40.432 --> 02:45.481
Used to get up, I guess it was about a quarter to six or something, such thing like this.

02:46.423 --> 02:56.321
We'd have breakfast 20 minutes to seven or so and be on our way to the field, to the forest, seven o'clock.

02:57.864 --> 03:01.390
We'd get back, depending on how

03:01.673 --> 03:06.940
as far as we were working from the camp, but sometimes it was the size of travel.

03:06.960 --> 03:13.629
We'd get back to the camp, or try to.

03:14.410 --> 03:16.473
And then it was free time.

03:17.354 --> 03:19.016
There wasn't much recreation.

03:19.897 --> 03:27.327
The Army tried to have as much recreation as they could, softball, baseball, things like this.

03:27.948 --> 03:37.017
But in the early years, they didn't have an educational program then, those early ones.

03:37.037 --> 03:38.839
But they did have recreation.

03:43.284 --> 03:45.906
And then in September you went back to the University of Minnesota?

03:45.946 --> 03:47.548
No, I didn't go back in September.

03:47.568 --> 03:49.290
I stayed until January.

03:49.310 --> 03:56.217
Oh, so you were in the CCC's then nine months, basically.

03:57.125 --> 04:00.830
And then, when I went... Why did you decide to stay on?

04:00.850 --> 04:01.431
To get some money.

04:04.615 --> 04:08.260
In case you were broke.

04:08.280 --> 04:08.581
Right.

04:09.422 --> 04:21.058
Then I worked on an assignment the next year, during the summer, into a winter quarter also, out in Idaho for the Forest Service.

04:23.081 --> 04:26.305
But that wasn't... Now, administratively,

04:27.044 --> 04:29.771
After your sophomore year, you worked for the CCCs.

04:31.235 --> 04:34.202
And then after your junior year, it was the National Forest Service.

04:36.127 --> 04:44.428
But the Forest Service was involved in that sophomore thing by way of the Northeastern Forest Experiment Station.

04:45.083 --> 04:49.471
This is the research branch of the Forest Service.

04:49.491 --> 04:52.477
The next year, I was out in Idaho National Forest.

04:52.657 --> 05:05.040
Okay, but before we get to that next year, you mentioned, here's one thing, before we leave the CCCs, you mentioned that it was there that you first were introduced to genetics.

05:05.060 --> 05:06.001
Is that right?

05:06.242 --> 05:08.526
Yes, I was using CCC crews.

05:09.113 --> 05:12.757
For the Northeastern Forest Experiment Station.

05:12.997 --> 05:18.543
On the Hopkins, what became known as the Hopkins Experimental Forest.

05:22.547 --> 05:32.438
And we were, as I say, laying out, mapping, taking inventory of all the different species that were on the properties.

05:32.772 --> 05:43.601
putting in the stakes where the plots were going to be grown, the breeding plots were going to be grown, but I never got down to the point where I was actually working with the variation.

05:43.621 --> 05:46.384
But I collected a lot of the native vegetation.

05:46.484 --> 05:47.685
I started the herbarium.

05:48.606 --> 06:01.497
And once about, must have been eight, nine years ago, after Williams College had taken over the station, I got a letter from the president.

06:02.523 --> 06:03.826
in Mexico.

06:03.846 --> 06:05.209
I was just leaving for India.

06:06.592 --> 06:12.684
And he said, look, our graduation is coming up in about three weeks.

06:14.729 --> 06:18.777
We see that you were the hidden hand behind me.

06:19.229 --> 06:25.575
laying out the whole herbarium here, which is now part of our collection at Williams College.

06:26.436 --> 06:39.749
And this has grown into a very nice research station for environment and the whole gamut of things like this for the biology department.

06:39.769 --> 06:47.076
He said, we'd like to invite you to our graduation and we want to give you an honorary degree if you accept.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.310
and I had to write him and say, well, I'm leaving for India and I won't be back.

06:52.151 --> 07:02.642
And I never made contact with him until now he's the head of the Mellon Foundation, the man who was president.

07:02.662 --> 07:15.055
A year ago last summer when I gave a lecture out up at the Summer Course in Colorado, what's the name of this famous summer program?

07:18.916 --> 07:21.380
At the University of Colorado?

07:21.701 --> 07:26.890
No, it's set up under some special program.

07:26.910 --> 07:42.477
Anyway, there were quite a few people there and this man, who had been president of Williams, was now president of the Mellon Foundation, I believe it is, and he said, finally I see the ghost.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.577
So those, the forestry ties come back.

07:46.837 --> 07:50.687
But this is the first time you ever were introduced to genetics.

07:50.727 --> 07:55.279
Do you remember what some of your feelings were about the study of genetics?

07:55.379 --> 08:01.495
Well, at that time I didn't get close enough to really have any feel, but I recognized the variation.

08:01.728 --> 08:04.073
Because I was always looking at these chestnuts.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.397
Some of them would die faster than the others.

08:06.597 --> 08:13.010
And by then there was quite a bit of Dutch elm disease around in New England also.

08:13.030 --> 08:15.114
I kept looking at this.

08:15.134 --> 08:19.703
And I had taken a beginning genetics course back in the university.

08:20.273 --> 08:27.863
And so, this had me thinking about this, but I didn't have a chance to really work with it then.

08:27.883 --> 08:29.225
Okay, let's go to the next summer then.

08:29.505 --> 08:29.946
Next summer.

08:29.966 --> 08:31.808
Up in Idaho with the National Forest Service.

08:31.868 --> 08:33.991
Yes, with the Idaho National Forest.

08:34.832 --> 08:44.265
And I was assigned to what was reputed to have been the most isolated forester in the USA.

08:44.405 --> 08:49.572
I was in the middle of the Chamberlain Basin wilderness area.

08:49.940 --> 08:55.448
We called them primitive areas in that time, not wilderness, primitive.

08:55.829 --> 09:09.869
No roads in there, and I was back on the Middle Fork with the Salmon River, the river of no return, and completely isolated.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.635
We went in by

09:14.105 --> 09:17.330
saddle horse and they took the horses out because it was high elevation.

09:17.370 --> 09:19.793
You couldn't keep the horses there.

09:19.813 --> 09:20.774
There wasn't enough feed.

09:21.776 --> 09:27.244
So you were left on fire alone.

09:27.264 --> 09:28.666
There were a few scattered around.

09:29.587 --> 09:38.860
And the food would be... No, they had put up log cabin.

09:39.481 --> 09:43.707
And always they were at high elevation for fire so you could see.

09:44.885 --> 09:53.454
boasts all the problems with water and everything else but it was a real good experience also and wonderful.

09:53.514 --> 09:59.140
This is where I got a feel for wildlife because it was untouched.

09:59.160 --> 10:12.394
The alp and the bear, a whole gamut of things and of course cooked your own food, washed your own clothing, carried your own water and

10:13.555 --> 10:22.363
Only contact we had, we had a telephone, of course, and one of those pre... Yeah, a telephone?

10:22.383 --> 10:25.086
Yeah, a four-service telephone because of fire.

10:26.788 --> 10:36.056
They're all connected in a network to the dispatcher's office at the ranger headquarters, about 50 miles away.

10:36.076 --> 10:43.123
Then we had one of these early TL high-frequency radios

10:44.200 --> 10:49.045
They used to fly a patrol plane over this area because it was so isolated.

10:50.907 --> 10:56.834
But these were pre-World War II, so you could talk to them if there wasn't too much static around.

10:57.755 --> 11:05.403
Lots of times you couldn't understand each other, but we used them as best we could.

11:05.423 --> 11:07.925
And what was your function up there?

11:07.945 --> 11:14.072
Spotting fires and sometimes being the lead guy onto them.

11:15.841 --> 11:20.106
Many fires, of course, if you catch them early enough, well, you can put them out with one man.

11:21.869 --> 11:26.474
But, and that means that spotting is critical.

11:27.816 --> 11:35.686
Of course, I saw some of the other kind where they blew up completely and where we had terrible times.

11:36.307 --> 11:41.393
Hundreds of people brought in into that back country and then supplying them.

11:42.757 --> 11:59.536
with food, dropping it out of planes and most of it would get lost before you could get, or bust it, before you could get the back strings established on a regular basis to bring enough food in.

11:59.556 --> 12:03.880
Of course, that's all been changed now with the jumpers.

12:03.900 --> 12:07.444
This preceded that.

12:07.464 --> 12:10.688
But there is where I learned to know myself probably better than

12:11.495 --> 12:13.177
than any other place in my life.

12:14.619 --> 12:15.159
In what way?

12:16.521 --> 12:33.340
Well, to get along with yourself and to, you have to get interested in lots of things because you soon run out of, you read everything that you brought with you, which you couldn't bring very much because of difficulties of caring.

12:34.602 --> 12:39.207
You soon ran out of reading material and so you had to,

12:41.195 --> 12:53.590
try to get interested in all sorts of things in nature, from chipmunks to pack rats used to fascinate me and also infuriate me.

12:53.610 --> 12:57.234
They'd pick up anything that you'd leave down, carry it away.

12:58.135 --> 12:58.836
Leather gloves.

12:59.356 --> 13:00.498
I ended up with one.

13:02.941 --> 13:03.802
They carried it away.

13:04.923 --> 13:06.004
All of these sorts of things.

13:06.064 --> 13:10.830
Then I became interested there in collecting

13:11.840 --> 13:27.001
forest diseases, forest trees, because I was going to take another course in forest pathology would have been my senior year.

13:27.542 --> 13:33.831
So I collected a lot of specimens that I took along that mission.

13:34.132 --> 13:48.572
Once in a while I'd try to go down when I could either get up early enough so you couldn't see, because you were supposed to be on fire duty as soon as you had good visibility to catch some fish.

13:48.672 --> 13:49.774
There were a lot of trout.

13:49.794 --> 13:50.415
I betcha.

13:51.376 --> 13:55.502
One thing that impressed me was all of the year when the salmon would run.

13:55.522 --> 13:59.888
Of course, by the time they'd get up to these headwaters, they were dying.

14:01.730 --> 14:03.092
They weren't edible.

14:05.266 --> 14:11.012
I bet you had a lot of eagles, didn't you?

14:11.032 --> 14:16.017
Yeah, there were eagles there, but I don't remember too many of them, really.

14:17.058 --> 14:18.019
A lot of elk and grizzly?

14:19.521 --> 14:20.822
Lots of elk.

14:20.842 --> 14:27.029
Grizzly and grouse, full blue grouse.

14:27.529 --> 14:28.450
Yeah, spruce grouse.

14:30.352 --> 14:32.775
And chipmunks.

14:33.886 --> 14:35.148
pack rats.

14:35.168 --> 14:36.651
What kind of trout?

14:36.851 --> 14:38.114
Brook trout and cutthroat?

14:38.795 --> 14:42.281
Cutthroat, mostly.

14:42.321 --> 14:43.283
Did you eat a lot of fish?

14:44.325 --> 14:45.106
As much as I could.

14:45.467 --> 14:45.627
Yeah.

14:45.848 --> 14:48.813
Because it didn't get any fresh meat, of course.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.321
How many?

14:53.622 --> 14:55.385
And there were deer back there also.

14:55.525 --> 14:57.208
Oh, yeah.

14:57.228 --> 14:58.290
How many?

14:59.198 --> 15:01.443
worked with you up there?

15:01.464 --> 15:02.426
All alone.

15:02.446 --> 15:03.749
You were all alone?

15:05.533 --> 15:07.278
No wonder you got to know yourself so well.

15:07.819 --> 15:07.919
Yeah.

15:08.942 --> 15:13.613
And there was one old prospector that had been back in that country

15:14.217 --> 15:16.539
Matty Mann, he is a character.

15:16.900 --> 15:33.416
I only saw him once, but he used to call me on the telephone, because he had a telephone too, because he had been there, he knew the country, and so he could report very often to the people, what's the best way to get into a certain canyon.

15:33.917 --> 15:37.340
And also, he served as an area.

15:37.801 --> 15:43.026
He would call every once in a while, and they'd say, how you doing up there?

15:44.221 --> 15:48.747
and kind of a guiding old fatherly hand.

15:49.588 --> 16:00.161
I remember as a young boy, I always used to see the bread being baked at home, my grandmother and my mother also.

16:00.181 --> 16:03.385
I thought I knew how to bake bread.

16:03.425 --> 16:06.729
I got up there and I was too high up in the east.

16:07.030 --> 16:09.233
It was too cold at night.

16:09.313 --> 16:12.777
The east just wouldn't work.

16:13.313 --> 16:20.020
the first weeks I eat those damn baking powder biscuits which turn me off even up to today.

16:21.241 --> 16:25.405
Finally one day I was talking to Matty Mann and he said, oh, he said, get you a pencil.

16:26.727 --> 16:30.650
He said, I'll tell you how to fix sourdough and you won't have any more problems.

16:30.670 --> 16:35.375
So that's when I became a sourdough advocate.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.719
He used to give us lots of tips about different things.

16:41.241 --> 16:42.122
Real character.

16:43.604 --> 16:44.686
How long were you alone?

16:46.168 --> 16:49.512
About six months.

16:50.434 --> 16:53.338
Six months without seeing another person?

16:53.658 --> 16:59.406
Well, one person just brought some extra supplies once.

17:02.270 --> 17:12.885
Well, I saw two other people when I was sent out on the fire and I found it first and then the follow-up proves it came from other directions.

17:13.912 --> 17:18.998
I came in and it blew up before I, but I got sent back.

17:19.018 --> 17:23.643
The two that followed me in, they said, you get back up there because it was real fire weather.

17:24.163 --> 17:29.569
The night before, you have dry thunderstorms out there.

17:29.910 --> 17:32.553
Sometimes it doesn't rain at all, but a lot of lightning.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.516
That night before, there'd been one of those.

17:38.459 --> 17:41.843
These two people who came in,

17:42.751 --> 17:52.148
told me I had to get back to the headquarters, I mean up where I was on the base because they were afraid that there were more fires around.

17:52.168 --> 18:07.695
It turned out they'd sent in quite a few people coming from the opposite direction and so I saw those two people but the only other one that I really talked to was the Packer.

18:08.317 --> 18:11.100
Why'd you stay up there six months?

18:11.120 --> 18:15.085
Didn't it freeze out come September or October?

18:16.146 --> 18:20.452
They keep them on in the bad places up until snow.

18:21.813 --> 18:32.306
Depends on the area, but in this area and I was there before fire season really started fixing telephone lines and all these sorts of things.

18:32.326 --> 18:34.729
So you went up there in June now then?

18:34.962 --> 18:35.763
Oh, in May.

18:35.783 --> 18:39.027
So, it was school last till June, didn't it?

18:39.488 --> 18:40.870
Yeah, but I took off.

18:41.651 --> 18:44.254
I don't know how it was, but I must have got the exams.

18:45.876 --> 18:51.904
I left immediately.

18:51.924 --> 18:54.107
And you stayed up there until November then?

18:54.748 --> 18:55.949
Yeah.

18:55.969 --> 19:02.678
I got back to Minnesota halfway through the quarter and took a, and I was taking a physics course.

19:02.978 --> 19:03.619
I got there,

19:03.835 --> 19:10.406
Just in time to, I suppose it was the mid-quarter exam.

19:11.107 --> 19:13.852
I think I got an 18 on the first day.

19:13.872 --> 19:17.579
I'm saying I've only been in the classroom one or two days.

19:17.599 --> 19:19.802
It's amazing that they even let you take the course.

19:20.504 --> 19:22.126
They never let you take it today.

19:22.146 --> 19:24.831
Then I really had to scramble.

19:27.629 --> 19:31.013
I got good grades later, but I had a hell of a time.

19:31.033 --> 19:41.447
I got a D. It's the only time I ever got a D in my whole life, even though I got a very good grade on my final, and I got a pretty good grade on my lab work.

19:42.668 --> 19:50.678
It's the only D I ever got in my whole life, and that turned me off.

19:50.698 --> 19:54.463
Well, at that time then, you were just becoming a senior?

19:57.211 --> 19:59.374
Let's see.

19:59.435 --> 20:00.316
No, no.

20:01.037 --> 20:05.604
I was... No, I was senior.

20:06.986 --> 20:10.011
I only had one quarter left.

20:10.532 --> 20:12.856
Somewhere along here we've lost a year.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.363
But I went back to take the final quarter.

20:17.423 --> 20:18.685
That was my final quarter.

20:19.987 --> 20:20.868
Fall quarter.

20:20.888 --> 20:21.389
No kidding.

20:21.830 --> 20:23.432
Yeah, we did lose a year someplace.

20:24.053 --> 20:25.075
Someplace.

20:26.557 --> 20:42.890
freshman, sophomore, junior.

20:45.695 --> 20:48.160
Oh, I know what happened.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.797
You got your degree in 1937?

20:50.817 --> 20:52.519
Was that December 1937?

20:53.440 --> 20:55.362
Oh, it was December of 37, I see.

20:55.382 --> 20:57.265
So that was the fall quarter I went back to.

20:57.405 --> 21:00.348
I remember one thing that I left out here.

21:01.589 --> 21:10.139
The freshman year, normally, at the end of your first year in forestry, you used to go to Cloquet, a summer camp.

21:10.539 --> 21:14.143
It was field forest experience.

21:14.163 --> 21:16.426
But I didn't have enough money to make that.

21:16.466 --> 21:17.607
You had to pay for your

21:18.667 --> 21:19.027
grub.

21:20.048 --> 21:22.530
We lived in the university cabins.

21:24.152 --> 21:29.657
But I got a job once when I was hitchhiking home, I guess, for spring vacation.

21:31.838 --> 21:36.222
A young agronomist picked me up that worked for Reed Murdock Canning Company in Rochester.

21:39.685 --> 21:47.492
And we were talking and he said, if you want to work this summer, I'll see if I can find you a job.

21:48.367 --> 21:50.469
He handled all the seal operations.

21:50.489 --> 21:52.331
He was graduating around in Illinois.

21:53.152 --> 22:02.562
So, I went down there after school, and that's where I missed a year, I'll tell you now.

22:04.204 --> 22:07.387
I went down and worked in the field.

22:07.407 --> 22:08.348
So, this was 1934 then?

22:09.249 --> 22:10.210
This was 1934.

22:10.451 --> 22:14.695
Summer of 1934.

22:17.273 --> 22:23.261
We were harvesting peas first, and I guess I worked pretty well.

22:23.341 --> 22:26.526
At least he made me a timekeeper.

22:27.147 --> 22:29.911
The growing wage at that time was 15 cents an hour.

22:30.011 --> 22:44.491
When I got to be a timekeeper, I'd get 18 cents an hour, but it had the advantage I could work as many hours as I wanted to, because we had to keep those green peas going in 24 hours a day into the plant.

22:45.152 --> 22:46.774
We had to get them out of the field.

22:47.108 --> 23:04.726
And so I'd work and turn in about 18, 19 hours a day and sleep a few hours up in the haymouth, in the farm that we happened to be on, and just grab some bites and root.

23:04.746 --> 23:08.269
Same thing during the corn, sweet corn pack.

23:08.289 --> 23:15.657
And then he'd let me stay on right up to school because they saved their own corn for seed, seed corn.

23:15.677 --> 23:17.098
And I'd handle and dry that.

23:18.091 --> 23:26.460
Then my sophomore year, I had to go to Cloquet, or to Itasca Park for the practical forestry training.

23:26.600 --> 23:36.390
It was the beginning of my junior year that I went out to, or it was after my junior year that I went out to Massachusetts.

23:36.410 --> 23:37.691
That's where we lost a year.

23:38.232 --> 23:47.862
The second year, after my sophomore year, I had to do what I should have done after my freshman year, go to summer camp.

23:48.162 --> 24:04.945
But by then I had the good fortune also of having worked for my board room in restaurants and in restaurants and in sorority house.

24:05.246 --> 24:08.170
I knew a lot about handling food and supplies.

24:08.971 --> 24:14.959
And so they elected me as steward to handle all the food operations up at summer camp.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.022
And for that

24:17.727 --> 24:20.070
I got my free food.

24:20.430 --> 24:20.890
Oh great.

24:21.571 --> 24:22.853
So I did that.

24:24.414 --> 24:25.896
How valuable was summertime?

24:26.937 --> 24:27.718
Very good.

24:27.738 --> 24:28.178
Was it?

24:29.219 --> 24:32.423
From the standpoint of thought.

24:33.064 --> 24:45.557
Well we got a broad training in the application of forestry, especially from the standpoint of silviculture, forest nationals.

24:46.583 --> 24:52.501
estimating timber volume, scaling logs.

24:52.521 --> 24:58.298
The one that I enjoyed most was we had a field course in botany.

24:59.020 --> 25:09.155
Dr. Rosendahl, who was one of the good taxonomists at Minnesota, very kindly person, and one in ornithology from Dr. Dawson.

25:09.175 --> 25:14.543
And both of those, I got very close to both of those two excellent professors.

25:16.566 --> 25:23.796
My feel for nature, undisturbed, came in a large part from both of those two people.

25:23.776 --> 25:35.415
Oh, I'd like to talk about that and some of the professors and some of the impact that these particular individuals had in your education in Minnesota.

25:35.435 --> 25:38.219
But before we move away from the summer camp, I was wondering, yeah.

25:38.680 --> 25:45.450
And so it was after my junior year that I went to Massachusetts the first time.

25:45.471 --> 25:48.175
And right before you were a senior that you went out to Idaho.

25:48.195 --> 25:48.315
Right.

25:48.717 --> 25:54.404
But I only had one quarter left because he had been in and out and I was an irregular student.

25:55.685 --> 26:04.256
But I was wondering at the summer camp and in forestry in general, were there any women in these classes at all?

26:04.296 --> 26:10.744
Today women are taking a number of these classes that have been so-called traditional male fields.

26:10.764 --> 26:13.527
At Minnesota when I was there there were no

26:13.810 --> 26:41.168
girls studying forestry, but Minnesota had been a pioneer in this, in that one of the first women graduates in forestry was Alice Stewart, who, when I worked in New England, she worked for the Northeastern Forest Experiment Station, and she lived in New Haven, worked at the headquarters on recreation mostly, outdoor recreation.

26:41.705 --> 26:49.716
So I got to know her there and Dickerman and he and I used to get together every once in a while.

26:49.896 --> 26:52.700
The Dickerman that I mentioned that became the deputy chief.

26:53.521 --> 27:03.654
But there were no girls studying forestry at that time, but she had graduated by respect to two years before I started.

27:04.335 --> 27:08.100
So she was one of the early graduates in forestry.

27:09.650 --> 27:17.418
Did you think it was somewhat unusual that a woman would be interested in that field at that time?

27:17.459 --> 27:18.480
What were your thoughts?

27:19.401 --> 27:31.554
Well, I never gave it much thought at the time, except I used to think once in a while when we would get together, I'd go down Dickerman's home in New Haven.

27:31.794 --> 27:38.982
So on Thanksgiving, I remember we went down and we went out to dance someplace or another.

27:39.248 --> 27:41.070
And I took Alice Stewart along.

27:41.730 --> 27:48.176
She danced very well, and she was a very pleasant person, and I got to thinking later.

27:48.936 --> 27:54.862
I never mentioned it to her, but I often thought, how did she ever happen to start into forestry?

27:54.882 --> 27:57.484
Because she was quite ladylike, quite feminine.

28:01.167 --> 28:03.349
Of course, you've seen almost a revolution in that.

28:03.369 --> 28:03.609
Oh, yeah.

28:06.852 --> 28:07.753
It's a different world.

28:08.013 --> 28:09.154
It sure is.

28:09.421 --> 28:15.168
Well, now let's go back to the professors and some of the impact that they had at the University of Minnesota.

28:15.689 --> 28:21.957
Could you analyze the quality of your instruction now?

28:22.077 --> 28:24.460
At the undergraduate level, let me start there.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.665
Yeah, well, we're not going to even get to the graduate level today.

28:27.805 --> 28:38.078
At the undergraduate level, in the general college, Fred Humphrey touched me with kindness and

28:38.311 --> 28:39.112
Motivation.

28:39.693 --> 28:41.997
I shouldn't say motivation, that has to come from within.

28:42.818 --> 28:44.281
Stimulation.

28:44.301 --> 28:53.596
He stimulated me and this had a great deal to do, I'm sure, with how I got myself organized.

28:55.379 --> 29:04.234
When I moved to forestry, the dean of forestry, Hank Schmitz, Henry Schmitz,

29:04.619 --> 29:12.069
was a very dynamic person, but also sometimes rather impatient.

29:12.089 --> 29:18.137
He later moved up to be the dean of the college and became president of Washington University.

29:21.341 --> 29:24.706
University of Washington, not Washington University, St.

29:24.726 --> 29:25.087
Louis.

29:25.107 --> 29:27.009
Not George Washington, but Seattle.

29:27.029 --> 29:27.690
Seattle.

29:28.025 --> 29:40.402
very dynamic person, a good spokesman for forestry, sharp individual, but he wasn't the best professor by any means with students.

29:40.583 --> 29:42.866
He happened to be my advisor also.

29:44.969 --> 29:49.916
When he would work out my program, he'd say, well, you better take this and this and this.

29:49.936 --> 29:54.522
I said, but I can't take that course because I've got to work for my

29:54.907 --> 29:56.730
bored those hours.

29:57.211 --> 29:58.333
I have conflict here.

29:59.695 --> 30:02.159
And every once in a while he'd give me fits.

30:02.179 --> 30:03.702
He'd say, what are you doing?

30:03.742 --> 30:06.447
Did you come here to go to school or did you come here to work?

30:07.408 --> 30:08.871
I said, I don't have any choice.

30:08.891 --> 30:11.896
This used to upset me.

30:11.916 --> 30:20.931
Later, he was also on my graduate committee and he became close friends, but this was pretty disturbing when you're a freshman, sophomore.

30:21.248 --> 30:25.112
and you're up to here with nothing to eat.

30:25.953 --> 30:28.096
But there was a compensation.

30:28.116 --> 30:37.807
There was a professor of civics and silviculture, Bill Cheney, C-H-E-Y-N-E-Y.

30:38.007 --> 30:50.682
He was a wonderful, sort of down-to-earth, easy-going guy with his pipe, kind of Will Rogers philosopher type.

30:51.337 --> 30:59.866
And he always used to illustrate his points very well in his lectures with stories.

31:01.407 --> 31:07.533
And many of these stories had the barbs on him so he wouldn't forget them.

31:07.553 --> 31:09.135
He was a very good teacher.

31:10.096 --> 31:21.327
And I suppose in forestry, per se, he had a very strong influence on me and got me deeply involved in this.

31:22.015 --> 31:23.197
There were others.

31:25.299 --> 31:45.947
Then there was a young instructor at that time whose footprints I followed later after I finished graduate school by the name of Frank Crawford, who was a forester by training, took his doctorate in gland pathology under Dr. Stateman,

31:46.518 --> 31:52.528
had come back and he was an instructor in forestry and forest products when I was an undergraduate.

31:52.548 --> 31:59.379
In the last quarter that I worked on NYA, I was assigned to work for him.

32:00.742 --> 32:09.476
He was running some studies on decay of wood with fungi and he was very stimulating.

32:09.556 --> 32:13.082
He had just finished his doctorate.

32:14.615 --> 32:20.481
He subsequently moved on to the job in DuPont Chemical Company.

32:20.501 --> 32:22.403
So that's why you work for DuPont later on?

32:22.683 --> 32:24.305
We'll get to that.

32:25.646 --> 32:30.351
So, let's see who else.

32:32.974 --> 32:35.176
I've mentioned this botany professor.

32:35.517 --> 32:40.842
He was from the main campus that taught the summer courses.

32:41.075 --> 32:56.492
in the same way with Ralph Dawson, the ornithologist, he was from the main campus, from zoology, they both left a big imprint on them.

32:56.512 --> 33:08.145
Then, indirectly from another department, at undergraduate level, Clyde Christensen,

33:09.475 --> 33:15.722
He was one of the Department of Plant Pathology, but he was the forest pathologist in the Department of Plant Pathology.

33:16.463 --> 33:24.172
One of the most brilliant teachers that I ever came across, except for statement.

33:26.755 --> 33:36.867
But in some ways, he had some idiosyncrasies that were very irritating.

33:37.825 --> 33:47.374
I remember when I first walked into his forest pathology one class.

33:48.596 --> 34:02.249
It was during the winter quarter, cold, and I had my big M sweater on because it was the only really warm thing that I had, that in a light jacket.

34:02.269 --> 34:06.533
And athletics used to turn him off.

34:08.167 --> 34:15.939
And so I walked in and sat down and he was a master at asking leading questions.

34:16.900 --> 34:21.067
I guess that big M just rubbed him the wrong way and burped.

34:21.087 --> 34:24.011
This was the first day we hadn't even had a text assigned.

34:24.632 --> 34:25.533
He didn't use it.

34:25.553 --> 34:27.096
It turned out he didn't use a text.

34:29.339 --> 34:32.804
He had a series of references.

34:32.824 --> 34:35.288
But he started in asking questions right off.

34:36.415 --> 34:42.644
And these kind of damn things, you know, that were leading questions, and I tried to ask and answer.

34:42.664 --> 34:43.845
I had no preparation.

34:46.469 --> 34:48.792
Lead me out farther and farther.

34:49.013 --> 34:55.682
I'd make a wrong statement, and then he'd lead you farther until you saw that you were ridiculous.

34:56.122 --> 35:00.589
Probably every damn question you'd answer was wrong.

35:00.609 --> 35:02.271
This made me burn.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.444
really made me burn.

35:05.904 --> 35:09.308
And I said, damn, he'll never do this to me again.

35:11.230 --> 35:14.373
Oh, is he ridiculing you for wearing that sweater?

35:14.474 --> 35:16.916
I have a feeling that underneath it was that.

35:17.457 --> 35:19.018
He did it to other people, too.

35:19.098 --> 35:24.344
But the first day, I think that sweater was the one that turned him on to me.

35:24.684 --> 35:28.549
And I said to myself, he will never do this to me again.

35:29.550 --> 35:32.713
And I suspect that I read

35:34.060 --> 35:37.925
those references farther ahead than in any course I'd ever taken.

35:38.245 --> 35:45.033
When he'd come to work on me, I would just spit these things out in concise little statements.

35:46.695 --> 35:54.584
After about five goes at this over the next three weeks or so, he never asked me another question.

35:54.684 --> 36:02.413
In graduate school, he became my, at the master's level, my advisor.

36:02.950 --> 36:08.757
And that was, by then, I was telling you that I'd collected diseases and whatnot.

36:09.498 --> 36:13.263
So I'd become interested in forest pathology.

36:13.283 --> 36:16.346
But he really turned me off.

36:16.367 --> 36:22.054
But on the other hand, he was one of the best teachers that I've ever seen.

36:22.734 --> 36:27.300
And in his practical laboratory classes, he did the same tricks.

36:28.702 --> 36:31.405
You'd have a whole series of microscopes set up.

36:32.836 --> 36:36.461
And there would be, let's say, five questions.

36:37.662 --> 36:43.169
One main question and then five sub-questions.

36:43.189 --> 36:45.231
The main one was identification.

36:45.692 --> 36:50.959
And if you missed that, you missed all the rest of them because you automatically answered all the rest of them wrong.

36:52.881 --> 36:56.886
And he would state it so that

36:58.267 --> 37:05.376
by the context of this, he would try to mislead you into thinking that it was another disease.

37:07.078 --> 37:07.619
Really!

37:08.781 --> 37:09.982
He was really vicious.

37:11.925 --> 37:14.047
But he trained good people, didn't he?

37:14.067 --> 37:15.169
But he made you think.

37:15.689 --> 37:23.019
You just had that irritating way of making you take stock of yourself.

37:23.039 --> 37:25.422
As a matter of fact,

37:26.144 --> 37:37.579
I haven't got to them yet, but he has just written a book about the life of Stateman, Stateman, who died two, three years ago, major professor.

37:37.599 --> 37:39.962
It was his major professor in mind.

37:40.823 --> 37:43.026
It's being published right now.

37:43.046 --> 37:46.791
It just went on the press yesterday, and I got to identify this picture.

37:47.592 --> 37:48.653
They just called me.

37:48.853 --> 37:50.555
I tried to call before you came in.

37:50.575 --> 37:53.479
I didn't get this statement here.

37:53.499 --> 37:55.662
But Clyde Christensen wrote this book.

37:56.333 --> 37:58.735
life of statement.

37:58.755 --> 38:06.323
And so, and I wrote the foreword to it just a week or so ago, just going on in the press.

38:06.343 --> 38:07.044
Who's going to publish it?

38:07.905 --> 38:09.426
I think it's Minnesota Press.

38:11.488 --> 38:13.771
No, I take that back.

38:13.891 --> 38:17.134
It's the phytopath.

38:17.434 --> 38:18.776
They have their headquarters there.

38:18.796 --> 38:23.901
I guess they have a regulation or arrangement with some other press.

38:24.181 --> 38:24.822
I'm not sure.

38:26.455 --> 38:39.047
But anyway, Clyde was an excellent teacher, but boy, that's where you learn to think and not to be misled.

38:39.719 --> 38:45.287
Now, one last question about your undergraduate career and just the undergraduate career.

38:45.908 --> 39:00.110
When you went out in the field and you met people who were in forestry and attended other universities, you got an opportunity to compare your knowledge you gained in Minnesota versus theirs.

39:01.352 --> 39:07.040
What do you think on a sort of a national level was your education?

39:07.541 --> 39:08.983
What quality would you say?

39:09.301 --> 39:17.592
In forestry, where I took my undergraduate work, I thought it was one of the best forestry schools in the United States at that time.

39:17.612 --> 39:18.994
I hope it wasn't too biased.

39:19.134 --> 39:21.878
It was a good school.

39:21.898 --> 39:25.063
And especially because of the supporting courses you got.

39:25.103 --> 39:31.011
For example, I was mentioning forest pathology.

39:32.172 --> 39:34.856
In entomology, where I worked.

39:35.377 --> 39:38.481
In zoology, in botany.

39:39.271 --> 39:41.554
they were first-rate in biochemistry.

39:43.376 --> 39:49.844
They had very prominent people in genetics, in Hayes's department.

39:50.525 --> 40:01.359
So that even though they weren't all in the School of Forestry, the support in the basic principles was excellent.

40:01.379 --> 40:08.147
And the way that during this last quarter of undergraduate, right before exams,

40:09.359 --> 40:13.345
I saw a notice on the bulletin board that Dr. E.C.

40:13.746 --> 40:16.751
Stateman was going to give a Sigma Psi lecture.

40:18.053 --> 40:23.802
And my only contact with him was once in Clyde Christensen's forest pathology lab.

40:25.385 --> 40:27.107
This man opened the door.

40:27.408 --> 40:30.393
We were all sitting around looking at microscopes.

40:30.493 --> 40:32.456
I remember even what we were looking at.

40:32.476 --> 40:37.003
We were looking at blue stained fungi and pine.

40:37.405 --> 40:41.350
And this person stuck his head in and said, Dr. Christensen here.

40:42.131 --> 40:45.496
Somebody said, you just stepped out, I think you'll be back in a few minutes.

40:45.636 --> 40:55.670
So, this professor, elderly, very dignified man, came in and said, well, what are you doing?

40:55.990 --> 40:58.013
He started coming down.

40:59.107 --> 41:15.134
I was probably three places down from him, but I could hear him as he was looking over the shoulder at this guy, drawing the mycelium of the stained fungi in the rays and cells of the pine.

41:16.196 --> 41:18.139
And he said, well, that isn't quite right.

41:18.159 --> 41:20.102
Doesn't it look more like this?

41:22.900 --> 41:24.463
with a pipe in his mouth.

41:25.865 --> 41:33.838
And he was giving an explanation, but not in a very low key, but making some suggestions.

41:33.858 --> 41:41.531
I know who he was, but I never had any contact.

41:41.551 --> 41:45.077
And he came to the next one and I heard this.

41:45.850 --> 41:49.635
By then, before he got to me, he was moving down.

41:50.156 --> 41:54.942
Clyde Christensen came in, and that was the end of it.

41:54.962 --> 41:57.565
And I thought, my God, how does this guy know anything about forestry?

41:57.906 --> 42:00.949
This was statement.

42:00.989 --> 42:06.897
So that last quarter, I saw he was going to give this Sigma Psi lecture just before finding an exam.

42:07.017 --> 42:08.820
So I went to listen to this.

42:08.840 --> 42:11.503
This was...

42:11.787 --> 42:16.853
these shifty little enemies that destroy our crops or something like that.

42:19.756 --> 42:22.520
I was really taken up.

42:22.560 --> 42:32.952
He was a very effective speaker and he showed some good slides to show the complexities of the rust fungi in our cereals and I thought,

42:34.822 --> 42:39.589
Someday, if I ever take graduate work, I want to study with him.

42:39.609 --> 42:41.792
He made such an impression.

42:41.812 --> 42:45.256
It so happened that I was going back to the Forest Service.

42:45.356 --> 42:53.988
By then, I had taken my junior forestry exam, the civil service thing, and I was the highest in our class.

42:54.109 --> 42:55.951
Only about three of us passed the thing.

42:55.971 --> 43:00.197
It was tough in that time because they wanted the tough because there wasn't enough jobs by there.

43:01.659 --> 43:04.643
And so before I left Idaho,

43:04.927 --> 43:08.351
coming back in the middle of the quarter.

43:10.753 --> 43:14.117
They said, all right, you can come back in the middle of January.

43:15.419 --> 43:18.242
We'll have a permanent job for you.

43:18.302 --> 43:28.994
So, I went through graduation, and right about Christmas time, I got a letter from the supervisor.

43:29.014 --> 43:34.680
He said, look, would it be all right with you if you came the middle of May?

43:35.032 --> 43:43.824
because we've got some budget problems, and this will ease it for us if you can find something worthwhile to do on taildown.

43:43.844 --> 43:49.872
So I decided I'd start graduate school, take one quarter, just one quarter with steak.

43:50.012 --> 43:54.698
That will stay out.

43:54.718 --> 43:58.283
And that one quarter led to the inevitable.

44:00.025 --> 44:04.431
But I did go out on one further assignment back in New England on forestry.

44:05.339 --> 44:16.769
I guess I just about finished my master's in that emergency after that hurricane blew down all that timber.

44:16.789 --> 44:18.353
Well, this is a good place to stop.
