WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:32.630
I

00:05.740 --> 00:32.630
said, what are you doing up there? I

00:32.610 --> 00:43.070
said, good idea. I said, good. I'll talk over it. I 
can't stop. I'm

00:47.430 --> 01:01.500
going to the bar. I'm going to the bar. I

01:03.790 --> 01:16.510
got an idea. I'm going to the bar. I got to come back. 
I'm going to talk to him. I'm going to raise him. I'm

01:24.870 --> 01:31.620
going to watch. I

01:31.600 --> 02:03.250
had a meeting with the president, taking away the 
stock at 5%. I'm

02:03.230 --> 02:16.730
concerned about that. I

02:16.710 --> 02:37.820
had a meeting. I

02:37.800 --> 02:44.380
had a new governor. Which governor was it? I

02:46.360 --> 03:30.860
forgot. I have no name. I

03:31.160 --> 03:42.060
thought for a dollar a year. A

03:42.040 --> 03:46.540
half a million. when

03:46.520 --> 06:34.460
you met with governor daniels before he appointed 
you to the a&m board you said that you promised him

06:34.460 --> 06:41.680
you would not vote for co-education while he was 
governor did he ask you any other questions

06:41.660 --> 07:07.550
he was not necessarily opposed to co-education 
was it didn't he think it was just politically

07:07.530 --> 07:14.000
dangerous had you known governor daniel a long 
time and y'all had worked together before then now

07:13.980 --> 07:25.900
good governor was it governor connelly that 
reappointed you did

07:25.880 --> 07:30.370
he did y'all have a conversation before he didn't 
call you up or anything or or quiz you interview you

07:36.050 --> 08:10.630
you had supported him in

07:36.050 --> 08:10.630
those 12 years did the governor call you during 
your service to talk about a&m did you go to the

08:10.610 --> 08:20.380
legislature to lobby for a&m during those years

08:20.360 --> 09:00.890
bill moore as senator was a strong advocate for a&m 
yes

09:02.270 --> 09:12.640
sir do you remember brown rig dewey the state 
representative from brazos county then he was a

09:12.620 --> 09:19.070
small kind of quiet man but he was in the house of 
representatives uh were there any uh strong

09:19.050 --> 09:27.430
opponents in the legislature of uh uh

09:27.410 --> 09:44.330

09:27.410 --> 09:44.330

archie oh i guess i did i guess this is something the

last time i've seen you well

10:05.780 --> 10:10.310

board was a man this christian still the hostess at

10:14.110 --> 10:19.370

of her sons the other day jim and he was telling me

10:24.450 --> 10:28.000
that after his father died did you meet at the MSC or 
at the board house?

10:45.150 --> 10:45.719
Let's see. Let me ask about some other people. 
Tiger Teague, was he a good ally for A&M? What were

10:56.470 --> 10:58.910
his primary concerns? What did he work hardest 
for,

10:59.230 --> 11:04.410
for A&M?

11:07.290 --> 11:11.550
What about Lupo, old Army Lou? J.E. Lupo that ran 
the store at Northgate, he was a classmate of Mr.

11:17.430 --> 11:20.910
Rutter and Mr. Teague's, and he loaned money to 
students always. Pinky Downs. Pinky Downs?

11:33.980 --> 11:35.221
Because you know Pinky Downs? Yes,

11:35.260 --> 11:45.009
sir.

11:45.150 --> 12:06.250
I

11:45.150 --> 12:06.250
remember him as a, when I got there, he was a kind of a 
frail little man, but always had a smile and had

12:08.830 --> 12:13.150
lots of energy and was always going around shaking 
hands and patting people on the back. That's

12:18.530 --> 12:19.604
right. Sure was.

12:24.610 --> 12:25.118
Yes, sir. Let's see. Mr. Zachary, as a, I know he was 
a classmate. Oh, class behind you. When he was on

12:38.700 --> 12:40.500
the board, was he a strong supporter of change? Oh, 
he was not for coeducation,

12:52.230 --> 12:54.750
but he did care about A&M very deeply.

12:58.270 --> 13:00.830
And there, we understand, that his son may soon be 
appointed to the board. Okay, good man. Yes, sir.

13:10.236 --> 13:10.720
Let's see. We talked about Buck Shewitch 
yesterday. When Buck was a student, was he large in

13:17.780 --> 13:23.000
weight as he would later be, or was he kind of trim? 
And did, was he a pleasant, and a friend, and a

13:34.810 --> 13:35.831
friend's eye? Yes, sir. No, he was a good kid. He was 
a great, good kid. Oh, he was a great kid. He was a

13:40.800 --> 13:41.821
great guy. He was a great, great guy. He was a great 
guy. He was a very good guy. He was a great guy. Yes,

13:45.800 --> 13:46.780
sir. One of the best friends I have. I want to bid for 
them, because my wife and I knew him, and we collect

13:50.800 --> 13:51.821
Shewitch items. Buck was such a special guy. He 
was, isn't he? Oh, yes, yes. Let's see. Tom

13:55.433 --> 13:56.820
Harrington, you knew him as a student. What kind of 
student was he? Christian. What kind of student

13:59.819 --> 14:00.930
was he? Christian.

14:13.350 --> 14:14.911
And he was from Plano. My earliest years, we lived 
in Garland, and when we needed anything fixed on

14:20.040 --> 14:24.260
the Farmall tractor, we went to Plano because the 
Harrington family owned that, and I believe a

14:29.440 --> 14:33.420
funeral home, and I think a furniture store. And 
the Harrington family was very, very good. As time

14:40.380 --> 14:47.220
came to consider co-education and volunteer 
core, was Dr. Harrington supportive of those

14:47.700 --> 14:50.560
changes?

14:54.960 --> 14:55.444
Okay. I hadn't thought about that, that he would 
have to follow the board. Let's see. Dick Hervey,

15:02.189 --> 15:05.840
as executive director of the former students, was 
he a strong

15:07.740 --> 15:14.080
advocate for A&M? Because

15:14.080 --> 15:20.180
you and Dick worked closely together, didn't you? 
What about Buck Wyrus? Buck's a good guy. He sure

15:25.880 --> 15:26.821
was. He sure was. The former student association 
has been very blessed to have such good

15:32.320 --> 15:37.620
leadership, and now with Randy Mattson. Randy's 
one of my favorites. I met him the day that John

15:40.330 --> 15:43.970
Lindsay brought him to A&M to try to recruit him as a 
student. Okay. He's a good man. Oh, he's a splendid

15:48.340 --> 15:50.120
man.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.749
Trackball. Trackman. Oh,

15:55.720 --> 16:04.250
in high school, he was All-State. Then he played 
one year of basketball at A&M and was very, very

16:08.090 --> 16:09.611
good. Basically, he's a good, solid human being. I 
agree. Let's see. Let's see. You were in the Corps?

16:26.890 --> 16:27.498
Cadets. What did you learn from that experience? 
What did being in the Corps teach you? To be on time,

16:33.640 --> 16:35.021
I guess. To be on time. To be a good

16:36.680 --> 16:42.380
student.

16:51.160 --> 16:55.200
Describe the uniforms that you all wore when you 
were a student. What did the uniforms look like

16:55.320 --> 16:59.720
then, the student uniforms?

17:09.540 --> 17:11.201
Was it a gray shirt then? Button-up

17:11.680 --> 17:15.640
collar.

17:19.740 --> 17:22.380
Did you all wear the high senior boots?

18:27.390 --> 18:33.080
Did you... Did you call your roommates 
Fish-O-Ladies then? I don't remember. Did you all

18:35.070 --> 18:37.090
have a lot of slang? Do you remember any of it? No. 
Did the teachers, the faculty members, have

18:42.264 --> 18:45.950
nicknames then? I guess they did.

19:33.170 --> 20:44.030
I

19:33.170 --> 20:44.030
came to Pitt's course, cleaning up the bar. That's 
all we did. It was a good one. Now, what were your

20:51.670 --> 20:54.230
favorite courses? What subjects did you most 
enjoy? At A&M.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.261
Enjoyed all of them.

21:11.060 --> 21:11.562
Agronomy?

21:18.120 --> 21:18.861
I did it. When you make a hundred, then you did. What 
were the hardest courses for you? The ones that you

21:26.400 --> 21:28.440
had to work the hardest.

21:51.030 --> 21:56.130
You mentioned yesterday Tommy Mayo as the fine 
librarian. Best librarian. Did he teach any

21:59.547 --> 22:02.020
courses then in English? No.

22:18.640 --> 22:19.281
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. How was that specialized? 
Was it J-I-N-T-O? Now,

22:26.130 --> 22:31.300
that wasn't a secret society, was it?

22:34.460 --> 22:52.290
How

22:34.460 --> 22:52.290
often did the Gento meet? Once a month. Did each of 
you sometimes give the program?

23:02.040 --> 23:02.681
Oh, I see. Oh,

23:05.260 --> 23:13.880
best course you had.

23:23.440 --> 23:31.560
Dana Bible, the coach,

23:23.440 --> 23:31.560
the star of the football team?

23:41.360 --> 23:41.865
Then? I don't know. No. Coach Dana X. Bible was the 
football coach,

23:51.460 --> 23:54.640
but I don't remember who the basketball coach was. 
Let's see. Did I ask you if you knew Hiney Weir? He

23:58.580 --> 24:13.060
later taught at Shriner in Kerrville. Was he a good 
student?

24:18.160 --> 24:19.501
And let's see. Did you know King Gill?

24:23.710 --> 24:25.710
Was he a little guy? Medium size. But he wasn't as 
big as Weir, was he? No. Was Gill a good football

24:33.585 --> 24:35.160
player? No. Must have been? Okay. Was Coach Bible 
an excellent coach? Did he relate well to

24:45.250 --> 24:49.830
students? Very good. Very good. Because to me, the 
12th man story revolves around him. Whether it's a

25:03.040 --> 25:07.140
legend or a fact, it still relates around him. He's 
a good one. When did people begin? When did people

25:10.560 --> 25:12.580
begin to talk about the 12th man? Do you know?

25:18.030 --> 25:19.331
Was it soon after that? Soon after that. Soon after 
that. Let's see. Y'all ate in Sabeasa. Did anybody

25:25.750 --> 25:30.750
ever get into biscuit fights and throw biscuits? 
No, I don't. You don't remember? Did y'all behave

25:33.160 --> 25:36.080
well in Sabeasa? I do. Seniors would do something 
about that. Oh, seniors would do something about

25:39.820 --> 25:41.740
that? Yeah, probably. Now, When they paddled you, 
when did they do it? Was it after supper?

25:55.090 --> 25:56.122
After supper. And then where would that happen? In 
the dormitory? And they'd line everybody up? Did

26:03.140 --> 26:06.360
the sophomores do the paddling or the seniors? 
Sophomores.

26:11.710 --> 26:12.625
Let's see. Back to Tommy Mayo. Does your love for 
the library, does Tommy Mayo help you? Yes, sir. Do

26:22.008 --> 26:24.830
you want to stimulate that? Yes, sir. See, I think 
that's good proof that the good works of people can

26:25.412 --> 26:35.510
live a long, long time. Like each, my office is in 
the Evans Library, so each day when I go to my

26:35.490 --> 26:43.330
office, I am proud to say that I have an 
acquaintance with you. Was the YMCA active then?

26:51.910 --> 26:53.711
Sure. What did you all do at the Y?

27:06.120 --> 27:06.701
Speeches? Yes. Was there a pool hall in there? Yes. 
There was? Yes. Was there a swimming pool? Yes. So

27:16.831 --> 27:18.800
an indoor swimming pool, pool hall. Were you all 
allowed to play cards? Yes. I don't remember.

27:27.710 --> 27:33.770
In class, did you ever sleep through class and not 
go to class? No, I didn't. What? What would happen

27:35.839 --> 27:40.010
if somebody went to sleep in class? They'd

27:39.990 --> 27:45.140
beat the hell out of you for a freshman. Let's

27:45.120 --> 27:50.015
see. Now, you graduated in four years. During that 
time, do you remember any famous people coming to

27:54.670 --> 28:00.330
the campus? Any famous generals or presidents?

28:06.740 --> 28:14.490
Did General Pershing, by chance, did he come?

28:14.470 --> 28:15.082
Let's see. Guyon Hall was... No. Guyon Hall was the 
big assembly room. Did you all have worship

28:23.720 --> 28:27.970
services in there? And who would lead the service? 
Who would do the preaching?

28:35.940 --> 28:40.640
Was there a chaplain for the...

28:40.620 --> 28:44.360
Did you all have a religious emphasis week? In the 
1950s, there was religious emphasis week. Did you

28:49.480 --> 28:52.910
go to church while you were a student? Where? On 
campus? Or off campus? On campus. Had you been a

29:00.574 --> 29:04.600
church member before you went away? What 
denomination? Baptist. So you were fully

29:08.220 --> 29:19.310
immersed and washed clean.

29:19.290 --> 29:28.170
Were there any tragic events that happened to any 
of your friends while you were at A&M? Anybody

29:28.150 --> 29:29.811
badly injured? Anybody hurt in an accident? Most

29:31.850 --> 29:39.550
of them. Most of your friends, were they from the 
city, or were they from small towns? Small towns.

29:50.728 --> 29:57.800
And were they farm boys or ranch boys?

29:57.780 --> 30:00.780
Was DeWare Fieldhouse, was it built yet? The 
basketball...

30:00.760 --> 30:08.940
DeWare Fieldhouse, was it built yet? The football 
was played at Kyle Field. Kyle Field. Was Dean Kyle

30:14.212 --> 30:18.790
still active? I know nothing... Tell me about Dean 
Kyle.
