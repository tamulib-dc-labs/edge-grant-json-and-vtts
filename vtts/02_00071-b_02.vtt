WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:33.521
What are you doing up there?

00:33.542 --> 00:33.902
I had a good idea.

00:35.789 --> 01:02.633
Tell me about it.

01:02.653 --> 01:03.214
It sounded like a good idea.

01:03.234 --> 01:03.534
It's a feeling.

01:03.554 --> 01:04.095
That's what I got the idea.

01:04.115 --> 01:04.395
We're pouring.

01:18.584 --> 01:44.290
At a meeting, came into the meeting.

01:44.310 --> 01:45.111
Remember, the two boys were ready to go.

01:45.131 --> 01:45.551
He said, we're ready.

01:45.571 --> 01:45.792
Try it out.

01:45.812 --> 01:46.212
Boy, we got it done.

01:50.208 --> 02:19.843
I had a pity the judge

02:37.323 --> 02:43.894
I had a new governor.

02:43.914 --> 02:44.535
At that time, I asked me to go.

02:44.555 --> 02:45.055
I didn't want to go home.

02:45.075 --> 03:01.181
Which governor was it?

03:01.201 --> 03:01.542
I don't remember.

03:01.562 --> 03:01.903
The governor was.

03:01.923 --> 03:02.443
I don't remember his name.

03:02.463 --> 03:02.844
He said, I got him.

03:02.864 --> 03:03.465
He said, I'm sure you got him.

03:06.702 --> 03:33.604
So, he began, bam, more pain, bam, bam, bam, like a thing.

03:40.418 --> 04:01.873
Twenty-five thousand dollars a year.

04:01.894 --> 04:02.354
I've tried to begotten.

04:02.374 --> 04:02.815
I'm trying to do that.

04:06.018 --> 04:33.713
Hmm

04:36.578 --> 04:57.188
I can't make sure the association was that way of that.

04:57.208 --> 04:57.268
No.

04:57.288 --> 04:57.408
Mason.

04:57.428 --> 04:57.548
Mason.

04:57.568 --> 04:57.688
Mason.

04:57.708 --> 04:57.828
Mason.

04:57.848 --> 04:57.969
Mason.

04:57.989 --> 04:58.109
Mason.

04:58.129 --> 04:58.249
Mason.

05:07.122 --> 05:27.741
I mean, he said, well, I need you what we've done.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.502
He said, I don't know, take any more.

05:28.522 --> 05:28.983
I can guess you people.

05:29.003 --> 05:29.885
Turn them down, and they had help with them.

05:29.905 --> 05:30.265
I'm afraid nobody.

05:30.285 --> 05:30.666
Finally got it out.

05:53.326 --> 06:19.595
Take away our money.

06:19.615 --> 06:20.116
All the banks went broke.

06:20.136 --> 06:20.677
Everybody had a big salary.

06:20.697 --> 06:21.317
That was a conservative method.

06:21.337 --> 06:21.778
Making everybody rich.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.238
Control all the money.

06:22.258 --> 06:22.759
All the banks went broke.

06:29.152 --> 06:41.746
When you met with Governor Daniels before he appointed you to the A&M board, you said that you promised him you would not vote for co-education while he was governor.

06:42.507 --> 06:44.650
Did he ask you any other questions?

06:50.997 --> 06:51.057
No.

06:51.077 --> 06:51.778
I don't remember.

06:56.523 --> 06:57.484
I said, everybody, I'm going to work against me.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.045
I said that I click at him.

07:01.737 --> 07:07.244
Now, he was not necessarily opposed to co-education, was he?

07:07.304 --> 07:09.526
Didn't he think it was just politically dangerous?

07:11.929 --> 07:13.972
Had you known Governor Daniel a long time?

07:16.334 --> 07:18.717
And you all had worked together before then?

07:18.777 --> 07:26.867
Now, was it Governor Connolly that reappointed you?

07:29.918 --> 07:38.612
Did you all have a conversation before he didn't call you up or anything or quiz you, interview you?

07:52.054 --> 07:54.778
You had supported him.

08:01.812 --> 08:14.163
In those 12 years, did the governor call you during your service to talk about A&M?

08:14.183 --> 08:14.463
No.

08:16.105 --> 08:20.689
Did you go to the legislature to lobby for A&M during those years?

08:29.717 --> 08:29.777
No.

08:31.462 --> 08:53.503
I checked him as soon as he got out of his head.

08:56.723 --> 09:03.010
Now, Bill Moore as senator was a strong advocate for A&M.

09:06.393 --> 09:06.774
Yes, sir.

09:08.195 --> 09:12.600
Do you remember Brownrig Dewey, the state representative from Brazos County then?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.482
I don't remember.

09:14.502 --> 09:19.828
He was a small, kind of quiet man, but he was in the House of Representatives.

09:19.994 --> 09:27.324
Were there any strong opponents in the legislature of .

09:27.344 --> 09:27.624
.

09:27.644 --> 09:28.846
.

09:28.866 --> 09:40.782
Oh, I see.

09:43.265 --> 09:46.069
Okay.

09:46.403 --> 10:05.268
While you were on the board, was Mrs. Cashin still the hostess at the board house?

10:09.133 --> 10:14.520
Because I interviewed one of her sons the other day, Jim.

10:14.602 --> 10:24.715
And he was telling me that after his father died, that for many years she was the hostess at the board house north of Cebisa.

10:26.177 --> 10:31.463
Now, when you all had board meetings, did you meet at the MSC or at the board house?

10:40.935 --> 10:41.456
I had room at our meeting.

10:41.476 --> 10:41.856
It wasn't too good.

10:41.876 --> 10:42.297
I got a good one now.

10:45.196 --> 10:45.677
Let's see.

10:45.797 --> 10:47.619
Let me ask about some other people.

10:50.502 --> 10:54.006
Tiger Teague, was he a good ally for A&M?

10:56.929 --> 10:59.131
What were his primary concerns?

10:59.231 --> 11:00.833
What did he work hardest for?

11:03.877 --> 11:04.437
For A&M.

11:07.781 --> 11:08.722
What about Lupo?

11:10.804 --> 11:11.625
Old Army Lou?

11:13.934 --> 11:14.395
J.E.

11:14.415 --> 11:23.808
Lupo, that ran the store at Northgate, he was a classmate of Mr. Rudder and Mr. Teague's, and he loaned money to students always.

11:25.630 --> 11:26.411
How do you know that?

11:26.431 --> 11:27.293
Pinky Downs.

11:29.996 --> 11:34.242
Pinky Downs.

11:34.262 --> 11:35.304
Did you know Pinky Downs?

11:35.324 --> 11:35.724
Yes, sir.

11:39.390 --> 11:39.710
Pinky Downs.

11:39.730 --> 11:40.431
I was torn up.

11:40.951 --> 12:10.722
I remember him as a when I got there he was a kind of a frail little man but always had a smile

12:11.512 --> 12:20.926
and had lots of energy, and was always going around shaking hands and patting people on the back.

12:24.712 --> 12:25.113
Yes, sir.

12:26.715 --> 12:27.276
Let's see.

12:29.820 --> 12:34.106
Mr. Zachary, I know he was a classmate.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.131
Oh, class behind you.

12:38.343 --> 12:45.110
when he was on the board, was he a strong supporter of change?

12:46.291 --> 12:48.153
Oh, he was not for co-education?

12:52.477 --> 12:55.240
But he did care about A&M very deeply.

12:57.822 --> 13:06.111
And we understand that his son may soon be appointed to the board.

13:07.092 --> 13:07.472
Yeah, good brother.

13:07.486 --> 13:08.047
Yes, sir.

13:10.190 --> 13:10.690
Let's see.

13:11.952 --> 13:14.215
We talked about Buck Shewitch yesterday.

13:15.277 --> 13:24.609
When Buck was a student, was he large in weight as he would later be, or was he kind of trim?

13:27.814 --> 13:30.497
Kind of trim.

13:30.517 --> 13:34.563
And was he a pleasant?

13:34.583 --> 13:36.025
One of the best friends I am.

13:37.709 --> 13:48.801
If you ever decide you want to sell any of your Shewitz items, I want to bid for them because my wife and I knew him, and we collect Shewitz items.

13:48.821 --> 13:50.463
Buck was such a special guy.

13:51.685 --> 13:52.005
He was his wife.

13:52.025 --> 13:53.847
Oh, yes, yes.

13:54.508 --> 13:54.808
Let's see.

13:55.168 --> 13:59.153
Tom Harrington, you knew him as a student.

13:59.173 --> 13:59.653
I knew him as a student.

13:59.794 --> 14:00.895
What kind of student was he?

14:02.456 --> 14:02.957
Because he was a student.

14:06.059 --> 14:14.968
And he was from Plano.

14:16.590 --> 14:33.687
My earliest years, we lived in Garland, and when we needed anything fixed on the Farmall tractor, we went to Plano because the Harrington family owned that, and I believe a funeral home and I think a furniture store.

14:35.607 --> 14:40.396
And the Harrington family was very, very good.

14:41.838 --> 14:50.594
As time came to consider co-education and volunteer corps, was Dr. Harrington supportive of those changes?

14:50.614 --> 14:51.936
I don't know.

14:51.956 --> 14:53.379
It had to be.

14:53.399 --> 14:53.920
The board was.

14:54.895 --> 14:55.416
Okay.

14:56.757 --> 15:00.101
I hadn't thought about that, that he would have to follow the board.

15:01.042 --> 15:01.502
Let's see.

15:02.163 --> 15:14.297
Dick Hervey, as executive director of the former students, was he a strong advocate for A&M?

15:17.140 --> 15:20.203
Because you and Dick worked closely together, didn't you?

15:22.106 --> 15:23.367
What about Buck Wyrus?

15:24.781 --> 15:26.744
He sure was.

15:27.225 --> 15:28.146
He sure was.

15:29.107 --> 15:35.436
The former student association has been very blessed to have such good leadership.

15:36.017 --> 15:40.283
And now with Randy Mattson, Randy's one of my favorites.

15:40.384 --> 15:46.492
I met him the day that John Lindsay brought him to A&M to try to recruit him as a student.

15:48.235 --> 15:48.555
He's a good man.

15:48.575 --> 15:50.118
Oh, he's a splendid man.

15:53.663 --> 15:53.843
Football.

15:54.464 --> 15:55.405
Track man.

16:02.854 --> 16:04.296
In high school, he was All-State.

16:05.017 --> 16:09.623
Then he played one year of basketball at A&M and was very, very good.

16:11.245 --> 16:14.549
Basically, he's a good, solid human being.

16:14.569 --> 16:17.833
I agree.

16:20.276 --> 16:20.917
Let's see.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.201
Let's see.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.468
You were in the Corps of Cadets.

16:27.828 --> 16:30.232
What did you learn from that experience?

16:30.252 --> 16:32.035
What did being in the Corps teach you?

16:32.055 --> 16:35.260
To be on time, I guess.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.122
To be on time.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.591
Best thing.

16:41.611 --> 16:46.840
You can tell me.

16:46.860 --> 16:49.564
I don't love them, but time meant a lot.

16:50.303 --> 16:55.290
Describe the uniforms that you all wore when you were a student.

16:55.350 --> 16:58.134
What did the uniforms look like then?

16:58.875 --> 16:59.837
The student uniforms.

17:09.951 --> 17:11.153
Was it a gray shirt then?

17:11.193 --> 17:17.922
Button-up collar.

17:17.942 --> 17:19.264
One year, I don't remember.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.368
Did y'all wear the high senior boots?

17:36.328 --> 17:36.648
No.

17:36.668 --> 17:45.541
I didn't really like him.

17:45.561 --> 17:47.023
I was too patriotic.

17:49.028 --> 18:14.817
It feels like, so I gotta have... I gotta... I gotta... I gotta... I gotta... I gotta... I gotta...

18:19.420 --> 18:32.893
Did you call your roommates fish old ladies then?

18:32.913 --> 18:33.934
I don't remember.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.977
Did you all have a lot of slang?

18:39.119 --> 18:39.199
Yes.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.220
Do you remember any of it?

18:41.942 --> 18:42.282
I don't remember.

18:42.302 --> 18:45.786
Did the teachers, the faculty members have nicknames then?

18:45.846 --> 18:47.587
I guess they did.

18:47.608 --> 18:48.128
I don't remember.

18:49.373 --> 19:13.427
I was going to, okay, pull my key.

19:13.447 --> 19:13.787
And I turned off.

19:13.807 --> 19:14.728
And I was like, yeah, she's going to exercise.

19:14.748 --> 19:15.289
I was going to pull my key.

19:15.309 --> 19:15.650
It was all right.

19:15.670 --> 19:16.871
Anyway, I remember going out and changing courses in winter.

19:16.891 --> 19:17.372
So I went out one night.

19:20.052 --> 19:31.368
He gave us a picture about how I did the best I could on it.

19:31.528 --> 19:46.430
And then he said, bitch, you're doing a real good job.

19:46.450 --> 19:46.870
He gave me a picture.

19:46.890 --> 19:47.311
How did that picture?

19:47.331 --> 19:47.591
I don't know.

19:47.611 --> 19:48.793
Anyway, at the end of the serve,

19:54.173 --> 20:17.547
He had trouble up the jam with him.

20:17.568 --> 20:18.008
He called you our guy.

20:18.028 --> 20:18.389
He cleaned it out.

20:18.409 --> 20:19.270
Cleaned out the board, damn it, big shovel.

20:22.203 --> 20:40.020
I told him later about what he was like right now.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.924
Anyway, I ended up with a friend of mine, a great friend of mine.

20:43.944 --> 20:44.244
He did his job.

20:44.264 --> 20:44.885
He kept cleaning up the bar.

20:45.426 --> 20:48.869
That's all we did.

20:48.889 --> 20:50.050
He was a good brother.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.073
Now, what were your favorite courses?

20:54.834 --> 20:57.677
What subjects did you most enjoy at A&M?

21:04.325 --> 21:10.713
I enjoyed all of them.

21:10.733 --> 21:10.993
I don't know.

21:11.013 --> 21:11.193
Agronomy.

21:11.213 --> 21:11.674
Agronomy.

21:14.237 --> 21:14.417
Agronomy.

21:16.287 --> 21:17.912
Practiced 100.

21:18.333 --> 21:18.794
I did it.

21:19.577 --> 21:22.204
Wanted to make 100 and you did.

21:23.528 --> 21:25.875
What were the hardest courses for you?

21:26.557 --> 21:28.643
The ones that you had to work the hardest.

21:51.455 --> 21:56.760
You mentioned yesterday Tommy Mayo as the fine librarian.

21:56.780 --> 21:59.482
Best librarian in the world.

21:59.502 --> 22:02.045
Did he teach any courses then in English?

22:16.878 --> 22:16.938
No.

22:16.958 --> 22:17.879
Tommy Mayo, one of the best instructors I had.

22:17.899 --> 22:18.219
Tentos is on it.

22:18.239 --> 22:18.740
You ever heard of Tentos?

22:18.760 --> 22:19.280
Oh, yes, sir.

22:19.681 --> 22:20.061
Yes, sir.

22:21.526 --> 22:23.609
How was that spell, Ginto?

22:24.210 --> 22:25.592
Was it J-I-N-T-O?

22:29.198 --> 22:31.281
Now, that wasn't a secret society, was it?

22:34.226 --> 22:37.190
No.

22:37.210 --> 22:41.317
Hadn't came into it so far again.

22:41.337 --> 22:41.697
It had a big room.

22:41.717 --> 22:42.438
Probably about four or three people.

22:42.458 --> 22:42.859
And I enjoyed it.

22:50.399 --> 22:52.242
How often did the Gento meet?

22:53.524 --> 22:53.784
Once a month.

22:53.804 --> 22:54.365
Once a month.

22:55.046 --> 22:58.131
Did each of you sometimes give the program?

23:01.236 --> 23:01.296
No.

23:01.316 --> 23:02.157
I talked one time.

23:02.177 --> 23:02.678
Oh, I see.

23:04.641 --> 23:04.902
Paper.

23:05.362 --> 23:06.164
Oh.

23:06.564 --> 23:07.886
Paper is going to be.

23:07.906 --> 23:10.410
Okay.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.011
I had an argument about that.

23:11.031 --> 23:12.814
I got the best course I had.

23:12.834 --> 23:13.896
Best course you had.

23:16.199 --> 23:16.400
Very good.

23:16.420 --> 23:16.660
I taught it.

23:23.440 --> 23:41.482
Dana Bible, the coach, the star of the football team.

23:41.502 --> 23:44.325
Then, I don't know.

23:45.547 --> 23:48.250
Coach Dana X. Bible was the football coach.

23:51.487 --> 23:54.611
But I don't remember who the basketball coach was.

23:55.372 --> 23:58.056
Let's see, did I ask you if you knew Heine Weir?

24:10.392 --> 24:13.537
He later taught at Schreiner in Kerrville.

24:13.557 --> 24:14.558
Was he a good student?

24:18.684 --> 24:21.207
And let's see, did you know King Gill?

24:23.161 --> 24:24.563
All right.

24:24.803 --> 24:25.725
Was he a little guy?

24:27.047 --> 24:27.627
Medium size.

24:27.647 --> 24:28.389
Medium size.

24:29.190 --> 24:31.994
But he wasn't as big as Weir, was he?

24:33.536 --> 24:33.696
No.

24:33.917 --> 24:35.479
Was Gil a good football player?

24:37.081 --> 24:37.462
Much better.

24:38.263 --> 24:38.784
Must have been?

24:38.924 --> 24:39.304
Okay.

24:41.628 --> 24:44.792
Was Coach Bible an excellent coach?

24:46.054 --> 24:46.254
Very good.

24:46.274 --> 24:46.775
Very bad.

24:47.857 --> 24:49.840
Did he relate well to students?

24:50.801 --> 24:51.001
Very good.

24:51.021 --> 24:51.582
Very good.

24:52.878 --> 25:01.489
because to me the Twelfth Man story revolves around him.

25:03.632 --> 25:07.136
Whether it's a legend or a fact, it still relates around him.

25:07.877 --> 25:09.179
He's a good one.

25:09.199 --> 25:12.603
When did people begin to talk about the Twelfth Man?

25:12.703 --> 25:13.204
Do you know?

25:13.224 --> 25:17.029
After King Gerald.

25:18.055 --> 25:19.317
Was it soon after that?

25:20.258 --> 25:20.999
Soon after that.

25:22.801 --> 25:23.201
Let's see.

25:23.582 --> 25:25.304
Y'all ate in Cebisa.

25:26.225 --> 25:30.931
Did anybody ever get into biscuit fights and throw biscuits?

25:32.332 --> 25:33.514
You don't remember?

25:33.994 --> 25:36.177
Did y'all behave well in Cebisa?

25:39.341 --> 25:39.441
I do.

25:39.461 --> 25:40.262
Seniors would do something about that.

25:40.282 --> 25:41.744
Oh, seniors would do something about that?

25:42.405 --> 25:42.645
Yeah, right.

25:43.334 --> 25:50.581
Now, when they paddled you, when did they do it?

25:50.661 --> 25:51.682
Was it after supper?

25:55.545 --> 25:56.086
After supper.

25:56.246 --> 25:58.648
And then where would that happen?

25:58.748 --> 25:59.589
In the dormitory?

26:01.130 --> 26:03.252
And they'd line everybody up?

26:03.272 --> 26:06.495
Did the sophomores do the paddling or the seniors?

26:07.756 --> 26:09.698
Sophomores.

26:12.080 --> 26:12.801
Let's see.

26:13.102 --> 26:14.364
Back to Tommy Mayo.

26:15.786 --> 26:22.175
Does your love for the library, does Tommy Mayo help to stimulate that?

26:25.020 --> 26:34.654
See, I think that's a good proof that the good works of people can live a long, long time.

26:35.292 --> 26:46.926
Like my office is in the Evans Library, so each day when I go to my office, I am proud to say that I have an acquaintance with you.

26:49.309 --> 26:50.410
Thank you very much.

26:50.430 --> 26:51.892
Was the YMCA active then?

26:53.414 --> 26:53.694
Sure was.

26:53.914 --> 26:55.416
What did you all do at the Y?

26:55.436 --> 27:03.826
I remember.

27:03.846 --> 27:04.066
I remember.

27:04.086 --> 27:04.607
The only thing I remember.

27:05.262 --> 27:06.704
Speeches.

27:07.585 --> 27:10.109
Was there a pool hall in there?

27:11.191 --> 27:11.672
There was.

27:13.755 --> 27:15.037
Was there a swimming pool?

27:16.559 --> 27:18.842
So an indoor swimming pool, pool hall.

27:19.623 --> 27:21.406
Were you all allowed to play cards?

27:23.209 --> 27:23.830
Don't remember?

27:24.911 --> 27:34.105
In class, did you ever sleep through class and not go to class?

27:34.827 --> 27:39.874
What would happen if somebody went to sleep in class?

27:43.358 --> 27:45.120
They'd eat that lunch for a freshman.

27:49.506 --> 27:49.987
Let's see.

27:50.347 --> 27:53.091
Now, you graduated in four years.

27:54.392 --> 27:59.479
During that time, do you remember any famous people coming to the campus?

28:00.280 --> 28:02.623
Any famous generals or presidents?

28:06.586 --> 28:09.650
Did General Pershing, by chance, did he come?

28:14.397 --> 28:15.058
Let's see.

28:15.078 --> 28:22.749
Guyon Hall was the big assembly room.

28:23.570 --> 28:26.535
Did you all have worship services in there?

28:27.897 --> 28:29.559
And who would lead the service?

28:30.220 --> 28:31.682
Who would do the preachings?

28:35.780 --> 28:44.292
Was there a chaplain for the... Did you all have a religious emphasis week?

28:44.312 --> 28:49.380
In the 1950s, there was religious emphasis week.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.703
Did you go to church while you were a student?

28:52.705 --> 28:53.025
Where?

28:55.208 --> 28:58.413
On campus or off campus?

28:58.433 --> 29:00.316
On campus.

29:00.576 --> 29:03.180
Had you been a church member before you went away?

29:03.220 --> 29:05.483
What denomination?

29:06.610 --> 29:07.171
Baptist.

29:08.172 --> 29:10.895
So you were fully immersed and washed clean.

29:19.186 --> 29:27.276
Were there any tragic events that happened to any of your friends while you were at A&M?

29:27.837 --> 29:29.299
Anybody badly injured?

29:29.319 --> 29:31.842
Anybody hurt in an accident?

29:39.331 --> 29:47.321
Most of your friends, were they from the city or were they from small towns?

29:49.123 --> 29:49.804
Small towns.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.729
And were they farm boys or ranch boys?

29:57.654 --> 30:01.679
Was DeWare Fieldhouse, was it built yet, the basketball?

30:05.143 --> 30:07.566
DeWare Fieldhouse, was it built yet?

30:08.795 --> 30:12.681
The football was played at Kyle Field.

30:14.183 --> 30:16.647
Was Dean Kyle still active?

30:18.450 --> 30:18.891
He seemed very active.

30:18.911 --> 30:19.532
I know nothing.

30:19.572 --> 30:21.195
Tell me about Dean Kyle.

30:32.973 --> 30:33.173
Dean Kyle.

30:33.193 --> 30:34.275
I had a friend that you had worked with a corporation.

30:34.295 --> 30:35.477
He said, I'm going to get you one corporation commissioner.

31:01.175 --> 31:26.170
Sure, I knew it.

31:26.190 --> 31:26.751
Maybe you're right about it.

31:26.771 --> 31:27.051
You know what?

31:27.071 --> 31:28.153
I tried to port a fellow to bang him so that you know.

31:28.173 --> 31:28.613
I don't know about it.

31:28.633 --> 31:29.274
So he ran his order or whatever.

31:29.294 --> 31:29.715
Sort him on the idea.

31:29.735 --> 31:29.815
Yes.

31:30.689 --> 31:33.322
I don't remember, but me.

31:33.342 --> 31:33.544
I got bad.
