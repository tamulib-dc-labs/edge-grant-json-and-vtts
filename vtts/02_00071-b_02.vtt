WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:33.630
I

00:05.740 --> 00:33.630
said, what are you doing up there? I

00:33.610 --> 00:47.450
said, I'm a good idea. He

00:47.430 --> 00:58.620
said, good. I'll talk over it. I canceled it. I 
called him. He

01:03.790 --> 01:16.510
said, are you going to come back? I

01:16.490 --> 01:21.420
said, you know, I'll come back. I'm going to break 
it. I was like, what? I had a meeting. I

01:25.870 --> 01:31.620
had a meeting. I

01:31.600 --> 02:43.079
had a meeting a few days ago, and it wasn't stopped, 
5%. I'm concerned about that. I had a meeting. I had

02:43.960 --> 02:44.380
a new governor. Which governor was it? I

02:46.360 --> 03:15.610
forgot his name. 16.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.100
It didn't happen easily.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.180
Ben, won't pay. Because

03:30.160 --> 03:50.230
I thought for another year after I forgot him. And

03:50.210 --> 04:00.590
he didn't do that.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.400
I was out. I was back. I

04:09.380 --> 06:29.239
broke. When you met with Governor Daniels before 
he appointed you to the A&M Board, you said that you

06:34.460 --> 06:41.480
promised him you would not vote for coeducation 
while he was governor. Did he ask you any other

06:41.460 --> 06:44.480
questions? He

06:44.460 --> 07:06.550
was not necessarily opposed to coeducation, was 
he? Didn't he think it was just political?

07:08.530 --> 07:09.535
Politically dangerous? Had you known Governor 
Daniels a long time? And you all had worked

07:16.110 --> 07:23.220
together before then?

07:23.200 --> 07:30.390
Was it Governor Connolly that reappointed you?

07:30.370 --> 07:51.540
Did you all have a conversation before he didn't 
call you up or anything or quiz you, interview you?

07:51.520 --> 08:06.050
You had supported him.

08:06.030 --> 08:09.050
In those 12 years, did the governor call you during 
your service to talk about A&M? Did you go to the

08:15.030 --> 08:57.350
legislature to lobby for A&M during those years?

08:57.330 --> 09:03.350
Bill Moore, as senator, was a strong advocate for 
A&M. Yes,

09:03.330 --> 09:06.823
sir. Do you remember Brownrig Dewey, the state 
representative from Brazos County then? He was a

09:14.230 --> 09:17.250
small, kind of quiet man. But he was in the House of 
Representatives. Were there any strong

09:20.230 --> 09:29.340
opponents in the legislature of coeducation? Oh,

09:29.320 --> 09:44.048
I

09:29.320 --> 09:44.048
see. Okay. While

09:45.170 --> 10:05.600
you were on the board, was Mrs. Cashin still the 
hostess at the board house? Shoot.

10:09.555 --> 10:09.857
Okay. Because I interviewed one of her sons the 
other day. Jim. And he was telling me that after his

10:13.894 --> 10:18.690
father died, that for many years she was the 
hostess at the board house north of Sabeasa. Now,

10:26.140 --> 10:44.950
when you all had board meetings, did you meet at the 
MSC or at the board house?

10:44.930 --> 10:45.718
Let's see. Let me ask about some other people. 
Tiger Teague, was he a good ally for A&M?

10:56.830 --> 10:58.850
What were his primary concerns? What did he work 
hardest for,

10:58.830 --> 11:07.350
for A&M?

11:07.330 --> 11:13.770
What about Lupo, Old Army Lou? J.E. Lupo that ran 
the store at Northgate? He was a classmate of Mr.

11:17.750 --> 11:25.690
Rutter and Mr. Teague's, and he loaned money to 
students always. Pinky Downs. Pinky Downs?

11:34.157 --> 11:35.280
Because you know Pinky Downs? Yes,

11:35.260 --> 11:45.010
sir.

11:45.150 --> 12:05.150
I

11:45.150 --> 12:05.150
remember him as a... When I got there, he was a kind 
of a frail little man, but always had a smile, and

12:11.130 --> 12:14.150
had lots of energy, and was always going around 
shaking hands and patting people on the back.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.538
That's right. Sure was. Yes,

12:20.130 --> 12:25.166
sir. Let's see. Mr. Zachary, as a... I know he was a 
classmate. Oh, class behind you. When he was on the

12:39.020 --> 12:41.040
board, was he a strong supporter of change? No. Oh, 
he was not for co-education? No.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.550
But he did care about A&M very deeply. That's 
right.

12:58.442 --> 12:59.370
And there... We understand that his son may soon be 
appointed to the board. Okay, good one. Yes, sir.

13:10.231 --> 13:11.460
Let's see. We talked about Buck Shewitch 
yesterday. When Buck was a student, was he large in

13:17.440 --> 13:21.460
weight, as he would later be, or was he kind of trim? 
And

13:26.520 --> 13:32.660
did... Was he a pleasant... A pleasant friend's 
eye. If you ever decide you want to sell any of your

13:36.130 --> 13:42.140
Shewitch items, I want to bid for them, because my 
wife and I knew him, and we collect Shewitch items.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.140
Buck was such a special guy. He was, isn't he? Oh, 
yes, yes. Let's see. Tom Harrington. You knew him

13:56.120 --> 13:58.140
as a student. What kind of student was he? 
Christian.

14:13.555 --> 14:16.240
And he was from Plano. My earliest years, we lived 
in Garland, and when we needed anything fixed on

14:20.220 --> 14:24.240
the Farmall tractor, we went to Plano, because the 
Harrington family owned that, and I believe a

14:29.220 --> 14:32.240
funeral home, and I think a furniture store.

14:36.260 --> 14:41.500
And the Harrington family was very, very good. As 
time came to consider co-education and volunteer

14:45.480 --> 14:47.500
corps, was Dr. Harrington supportive of those 
changes?

14:54.960 --> 14:55.465
Okay. I hadn't thought about that, that he would 
have to follow the board. Let's see. Dick Hervey,

15:03.960 --> 15:07.980
Executive Director of the Former Students. Was he 
a strong

15:07.960 --> 15:17.440
advocate for A&M?

15:17.420 --> 15:22.330
Because you and Dick worked closely together, 
didn't you? What about Buck Wirus? He sure was. He

15:27.000 --> 15:29.020
sure was. The Former Students Association has 
been very blessed to have such good leadership,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.020
and now with Randy Mattson, Randy's one of my 
favorites. I met him the day that John Lindsay

15:40.190 --> 15:44.210
brought him to A&M to try to recruit him as a 
student. He's a good man. Oh, he's a splendid man.

15:50.560 --> 15:55.430
Track

15:50.560 --> 15:55.430
man.

16:02.064 --> 16:04.930
Oh, in high school he was Allstate. Then he played 
one year of basketball at A&M and was very, very

16:07.910 --> 16:09.930
good. Basically, he's a good, solid human being. I 
agree. Let's see.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.790
You were in the Corps of Cadets. What did you learn 
from that experience? What did being in the Corps

16:29.770 --> 16:33.360
teach you? To be on time, I guess. To be on time.

16:50.260 --> 16:54.280
Describe the uniforms that you all wore when you 
were a student. What did the uniforms look like

16:55.260 --> 16:58.280
then? The student uniforms. Was

17:00.260 --> 17:11.300
it a gray shirt then? Button-up

17:11.280 --> 17:18.285
collar.

17:20.212 --> 17:22.620
Did you all wear the high senior boots? Did

17:22.600 --> 18:30.820
you

17:22.600 --> 18:30.820
call your roommates fish old ladies then? Did you 
all have a lot of slang? Do you remember any of it?

18:40.050 --> 18:42.990
Did the teachers, the faculty members have 
nicknames then? I guess

18:45.970 --> 19:33.230
they

18:45.970 --> 19:33.230
did.

19:33.210 --> 20:40.660
What

19:33.210 --> 20:40.660
did you do in the Corps of Cadets? I was a good boy. 
I'd clean up the bar. That's all I did. It was a good

20:46.050 --> 20:51.810
one. What were your favorite courses? What 
subjects did you most enjoy at A&M? Enjoyed

20:57.790 --> 21:05.500
all of them. Agronomy?

21:18.375 --> 21:20.420
I did it. Wanted to make a hundred and you did. What 
were the hardest courses for you? The ones that you

21:25.400 --> 21:27.420
had to work the hardest? to work the hardest

librarian
