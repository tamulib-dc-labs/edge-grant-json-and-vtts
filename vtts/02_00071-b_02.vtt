WEBVTT

00:04.570 --> 00:33.936
What

00:04.570 --> 00:33.936
are you doing up there?

00:38.337 --> 01:01.308
It's

00:38.337 --> 01:01.308
not like a good idea. We're defeated over this. No 
one ever used to do this. It's part of God's idea.

01:18.702 --> 01:44.537
And

01:18.702 --> 01:44.537
the meeting came into the meeting. The governor 
said, you boys ready to go? Yes, we're ready. Try it

01:45.739 --> 01:45.959
out. Boy, we got it done.

01:50.225 --> 02:15.787
The

01:50.225 --> 02:15.787
association

01:50.225 --> 02:15.787
didn't like the idea, but they didn't want to stop 
them. We had one broke, you know what I mean, five

02:15.807 --> 02:16.868
percent. So, as soon as I got to the association, I 
was like, anyway, we better get to the court. So, we

02:18.790 --> 02:19.451
were concerned about that. I had to be the judge.

02:34.100 --> 02:45.255
Which

02:34.100 --> 02:45.255
governor was it? I don't remember. I don't

02:45.736 --> 03:01.798
remember. I don't remember. I don't remember. I 
don't remember. I don't remember. I don't

03:03.260 --> 03:03.600
remember. I

03:04.576 --> 03:30.751
didn't want to do that. I didn't want to be a bad boy. 
I forgot to do that. I didn't want to be a bad boy. I

03:32.433 --> 03:33.034
didn't want to be a bad boy. I didn't want to be a bad 
boy.

03:40.351 --> 04:05.555
$25,000

03:40.351 --> 04:05.555
for a dollar a year. I've tried. I've tried. I've 
tried. I've tried. I've tried. I've tried. I've

04:07.017 --> 04:07.237
tried. I've tried. I've tried. I've tried. I've 
tried.

04:14.759 --> 04:37.683
.

04:37.703 --> 04:37.723
. .

04:52.947 --> 05:22.006
I'm

04:52.947 --> 05:22.006
sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:26.107 --> 05:51.865
And

05:26.107 --> 05:51.865
they had help with raising the money, but finally 
got it out. So they just take money away from us, and

05:51.885 --> 05:53.227
then they went to heaven. So they put the real bag 
before the veil, and they got a veil to take away our

05:53.247 --> 05:54.949
money. I

05:55.857 --> 06:18.394
don't believe it, but I don't believe it. But we got 
it done. All of that went broke. Everybody had a big

06:19.296 --> 06:19.836
salary. That was because everybody wanted it. 
Mm-hmm. And we got it. Making everybody rich.

06:21.539 --> 06:21.679
Mm-hmm. And good for all of us. All of that went 
broke.

06:29.202 --> 06:42.515
When you met with Governor Daniels before he 
appointed you to the A&M board, you said that you

06:29.202 --> 06:42.515
promised him you would not vote for co-education 
while he was governor. Did he ask you any other

06:42.535 --> 06:44.657
questions?

06:51.664 --> 06:56.709
I don't

06:51.664 --> 06:56.709
remember. I said, everybody, I'm ordering it. 
It's me. I said that. I clicked at him.

07:01.771 --> 07:07.278
Now, he was not necessarily opposed to 
co-education, was he? Didn't he think it was just

07:07.338 --> 07:09.520
politically dangerous? Had you known Governor 
Daniel a long time? And you all had worked together

07:16.348 --> 07:18.731
before then? Now,

07:18.791 --> 07:26.901
was it Governor Connolly that reappointed you?

07:29.952 --> 07:38.625
Did you all have a conversation before he didn't 
call you up or anything or quiz you, interview you?

07:52.065 --> 07:54.829
You had supported him.

08:01.829 --> 08:14.526
In

08:01.829 --> 08:14.526
those 12 years, did the governor call you during 
your service to talk about A&M? Did you go to the

08:16.128 --> 08:20.755
legislature to lobby for A&M during those years?

08:29.987 --> 08:30.047
No. Now,

08:57.280 --> 09:03.045
Bill Moore, as senator, was a strong advocate for 
A&M.

09:06.408 --> 09:06.789
Yes, sir. Do you remember Brown Rigg Dewey, the 
state representative from Brazos County then? He

09:14.256 --> 09:19.320
was a small, kind of quiet man, but he was in the 
House of Representatives. Were there any strong

09:21.182 --> 09:25.566
opponents? in the legislature of

09:25.613 --> 09:45.715
uh

09:25.613 --> 09:45.715
oh

09:25.613 --> 09:45.715
i see okay Okay.

09:59.029 --> 10:09.281
While you were on the board, was Mrs. Cashin still 
the hostess at the board house?

10:09.561 --> 10:10.542
Okay. Because I interviewed one of her sons the 
other day, Jim, And he was telling me that after his

10:14.618 --> 10:24.750
father died, that for many years she was the 
hostess at the board house north of Sabeasa. Now,

10:26.192 --> 10:31.498
when you all had board meetings, did you meet at the 
MSC or at the board house?

10:40.669 --> 10:40.970
At our meeting. At our meeting. It wasn't too bad. I 
got good with that.

10:45.213 --> 10:47.637
Let me ask about some other people.

10:50.521 --> 10:54.026
Tiger Teague, was he a good ally for A&M?

10:56.951 --> 10:59.194
What were his primary concerns? What did he work 
hardest for?

11:03.921 --> 11:04.462
For A&M.

11:07.807 --> 11:08.749
What about Lupo? Old Army Luke? J.E. Lupo that ran 
the store at Northgate, he was a classmate of Mr.

11:14.449 --> 11:23.819
Rutter and Mr. Teagues, and he loaned money to 
students always. How do you know that? Pinky

11:26.442 --> 11:27.283
Downs. Pinky Downs. Pinky Downs.

11:34.251 --> 11:35.332
Did you know Pinky Downs? Yes, sir. Pinky Downs. I 
have a story of when I was in the country over there,

11:38.960 --> 11:46.370
he stopped taking me.

11:49.274 --> 12:02.352
And he told me, about 8 a.m., he's praying, and he's 
praying, and he's praying, and he's

11:49.274 --> 12:02.352
praying, and he's praying, and he's praying, and 
he's praying, and he's praying, and he's praying,

12:03.395 --> 12:18.842
I remember him as a, when I got there, he was a kind of 
a frail little man, but always had a smile and had

12:03.395 --> 12:18.842
lots of energy and was always going around shaking 
hands and patting people on the back.

12:24.752 --> 12:25.153
Yes, sir. Let's see. Mr. Zachary, as a... I know he 
was a classmate. Oh, class behind you. When he was

12:39.205 --> 12:45.132
on the board, was he a strong supporter of change? 
Oh, he was not for co-education?

12:52.521 --> 12:55.285
But he did care about A&M very deeply.

12:57.848 --> 12:59.490
And there... We understand that his son may soon be 
appointed to the board. Yes, sir. Let's see. We

13:11.994 --> 13:14.236
talked about Buck Shewitch yesterday. When Buck 
was a student, was he large in weight as he would

13:15.318 --> 13:24.769
later be, or was he kind of trim? And

13:26.622 --> 13:35.014
was he a pleasant?

13:37.858 --> 13:48.172
If you ever decide you want to sell any of your 
Shewitz items, I want to bid for them because my

13:37.858 --> 13:48.172
wife and I knew him and we collect Shewitz items. 
Buck was such a special guy. Oh, yes, yes. Let's

13:54.466 --> 13:59.655
see, Tom Harrington, you knew him as a student. 
What kind of student was he?

14:13.579 --> 14:15.022
And he was from Plano. My earliest years, we lived 
in Garland. And when we needed anything fixed on

14:20.183 --> 14:36.581
the Farmall tractor, we went to Plano because the 
Harrington family owned that, and I believe a

14:20.183 --> 14:36.581
funeral home, and I think a furniture store.

14:36.601 --> 14:40.425
And the Harrington family was very, very good. As 
time came to consider co-education and Volunteer

14:46.154 --> 15:14.507
Corps was Dr.. Harrington supportive of those 
changes

14:46.154 --> 15:14.507
Okay

14:46.154 --> 15:14.507
Hadn't thought about that that he would have to 
follow the board Let's see Dick Hervey as

14:46.154 --> 15:14.507
executive director of the former students Was he 
was he a and a strong advocate for A&M Because you

15:16.782 --> 15:20.206
and Dick worked closely together, didn't you? 
What about Buck Wyrus?

15:25.992 --> 15:26.793
He sure was. He sure was. The former student 
association has been very blessed to have such

15:29.136 --> 15:35.463
good leadership. And now with Randy Mattson, 
Randy's one of my favorites. I met him the day that

15:40.408 --> 15:46.435
John Lindsay brought him to A&M to try to recruit 
him as a student. He's a good man. Oh, he's a

15:48.566 --> 15:50.128
splendid man.

15:53.571 --> 15:54.732
Football. Track man.

16:01.198 --> 16:02.159
Great football. In high school, he was All-State. 
Then he played one year of basketball at A&M and was

16:05.042 --> 16:09.647
very, very good. Basically, he's a good, solid 
human being. Probably the best. I agree. Let's

16:20.272 --> 16:20.913
see. Let's see. You were in the Corps of Cadets. 
What did you learn from that experience? What did

16:30.286 --> 16:32.069
being in the Corps teach you? To be on time, I guess. 
To be on time.

16:42.063 --> 16:43.405
You did it to me.

16:46.726 --> 16:50.589
I don't know.

16:51.170 --> 16:55.494
Describe the uniforms that you all wore when you 
were a student. What did the uniforms look like

16:56.274 --> 16:59.877
then, the student uniforms? Was

16:59.917 --> 17:11.147
it a gray shirt then?

17:14.630 --> 17:14.970
Button-up collar. Button-up collar. one there. I 
don't remember. Did you all wear the high senior

17:20.178 --> 17:22.380
boots?

17:35.351 --> 17:35.411
No. I didn't really like him.

17:40.115 --> 17:45.219
The

17:40.115 --> 17:45.219
serpent there. The serpent there. Too patriotic. 
You know, He

17:49.130 --> 18:15.160
was like, so I got out. Half of it. I got out. I had to 
say it in. I couldn't do it. I got out. I got out. I got

18:16.842 --> 18:17.043
out. I got out. I got out. Did

18:19.437 --> 18:32.937
you call your roommates fish old ladies then? I 
don't remember. Did you all have a lot of slang?

18:39.146 --> 18:39.226
Yes. Do you remember any of it? I don't remember. 
Did the teachers, the faculty members have

18:42.350 --> 18:45.855
nicknames then? I guess they did. I don't 
remember. I

18:49.390 --> 19:14.849
was going to get a full bikini, but it got turned 
off, and I was like, I'm just going to exercise. I'm

19:14.869 --> 19:15.951
going to put on a full bikini, and it's all right. 
Anyway, I remember going out to change courses,

19:15.971 --> 19:17.473
and so I went out one time. I

19:19.597 --> 19:44.020
gave her a

19:19.597 --> 19:44.020
picture

19:19.597 --> 19:44.020
about

19:19.597 --> 19:44.020
how I did the best I could on it. And she said, bitch, 
you're doing a really good job. She gave me a

19:45.101 --> 19:45.541
picture. And out of that picture, I had a kid. And 
after that, I had a boy friend. Anyway, at the end of

19:47.663 --> 19:48.844
the term,

19:54.224 --> 20:18.032
He

19:54.224 --> 20:18.032
had it. He had it. He had it. He had it. He had it. He 
had it. He had it. I told you later about it. What

20:24.173 --> 20:30.483
you're like

20:24.173 --> 20:30.483
right now. Anyway, I

20:30.703 --> 20:38.515
fell in love with a friend of mine. A great friend of 
mine. I did his job. Picked up a clip course. He did a

20:43.022 --> 20:45.446
clip course cleaning up the bar. That's all we did. 
It was a good one though. Now, what were your

20:51.683 --> 20:54.086
favorite courses? What subjects did you most 
enjoy at A&M? I enjoyed

20:57.491 --> 21:04.361
all of them. Enjoyed all of them.

21:11.170 --> 21:11.711
Agronomy.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.702
Agronomy. Agronomy. I want to make a hundred and 
you did. What were the hardest courses for you? The

21:26.590 --> 21:28.660
ones that you had to work the hardest?

21:51.472 --> 21:57.337
You mentioned yesterday Tommy Mayo as the fine 
librarian.

21:58.919 --> 22:02.082
Did he teach any courses then in English?

22:18.777 --> 22:19.277
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. How was that spelled, 
Gento? Was it J-I-N-T-O?

22:29.231 --> 22:31.294
Now, that wasn't a secret society, was it? And I 
enjoyed

22:33.857 --> 22:42.910
it.

22:50.450 --> 22:52.292
How often did the Gento meet? Once a month. Once a 
month. Did each of you sometimes give the program?

23:02.162 --> 23:02.462
No. We had a talk one time. Oh, I see. The paper was 
going to be in an argument about that. I got the best

23:11.051 --> 23:12.753
course I had. The best course you had. Very good. I 
saw it.

23:23.457 --> 23:30.244
Dana Bible, the coach?

23:30.264 --> 23:41.496
The star of the football team?

23:41.516 --> 23:44.359
Then, I don't know. Coach Dana X Bible was the 
football coach.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.645
But I don't remember who the basketball coach was. 
Let's see, did I ask you if you knew Heine Weir?

24:10.407 --> 24:13.171
He later taught at Shriner in Kerrville. Was he a 
good student?

24:18.699 --> 24:21.223
And let's see, did you know King Gill? Was he a 
little guy? Medium size. But he wasn't as big as

24:29.208 --> 24:32.012
Weir, was he? Was Gil a good football player?

24:38.320 --> 24:39.322
Must have been, okay. Was Coach Bible an excellent 
coach?

24:47.873 --> 24:50.957
Did he relate well to students? Very good. because

24:52.945 --> 25:01.517
to me the 12th man story revolves around him. 
Whether it's a legend or a fact, it still relates

25:03.640 --> 25:07.185
around him. When did people begin to talk about the 
12th man? Do you know?

25:18.181 --> 25:19.363
Was it soon after that? Soon after that. Let's see, 
and y'all ate in Sabisa. Did anybody ever get into

25:26.248 --> 25:30.934
biscuit fights and throw biscuits? You don't 
remember? Did y'all behave well in Sabisa?

25:40.027 --> 25:41.729
Oh, seniors would do something about that?

25:46.015 --> 25:50.621
Now, when they paddled you, when did they do it? Was 
it after supper? After supper?

25:55.417 --> 25:58.661
after supper, and then where would that happen? In 
the dormitory? And they'd line everybody up? Did

26:03.286 --> 26:06.509
the sophomores do the paddling or the seniors? 
Sophomores.

26:12.095 --> 26:15.800
Let's see, back to Tommy Mayo. Does your love for 
the library, does Tommy Mayo help to stimulate

26:15.820 --> 26:22.487
that? See, I think that's a good proof that the good 
works of people can live a long, long time.

26:36.270 --> 26:46.946
My office is in the Evans Library, so each day when I 
go to my office, I am proud to say that I have an

26:36.270 --> 26:46.946
acquaintance with you. Was the YMCA active then? 
No. What did you all do at the Y?

27:06.069 --> 27:06.249
Speeches. Speeches. Was there a pool hall in 
there? There was. Was there a swimming pool? So an

27:16.602 --> 27:18.865
indoor swimming pool, pool hall. Were you all 
allowed to play cards? Don't remember? In

27:24.916 --> 27:33.793
class, did you ever sleep through class and not go 
to class? What would happen if somebody went to

27:34.915 --> 27:39.905
sleep in class?

27:43.411 --> 27:46.457
They'd beat the hell out of you for a freshman.

27:49.475 --> 27:49.996
Let's see. Now, you graduated in four years. 
During that time, do you remember any famous

27:54.401 --> 27:59.487
people coming to the campus? Any famous generals 
or presidents?

28:06.676 --> 28:09.679
Did General Pershing, by chance, did he come?

28:14.385 --> 28:15.086
Let's see. Guyon Hall was... The big assembly 
room. Did you all have worship services in there?

28:27.911 --> 28:29.573
And who would lead the service? Who would do the 
preaching?

28:35.862 --> 28:43.233
Was there a chaplain for the...

28:35.862 --> 28:43.233
Did you all have a religious emphasis week? In the 
1950s there was religious emphasis week. Did you

28:49.364 --> 28:52.688
go to church while you were a student? Where? On 
campus or off campus? On campus. Had you been a

29:00.178 --> 29:03.181
church member before you went away? What 
denomination? Baptist. So you were fully

29:08.228 --> 29:14.596
immersed and washed clean.

29:14.616 --> 29:14.916
Amen.

29:19.165 --> 29:27.294
Were there any tragic events that happened to any 
of your friends while you were at A&M? Anybody

29:27.835 --> 29:29.277
badly injured? Anybody hurt in an accident?

29:39.509 --> 29:47.518
Most of your friends, were they from the city or 
were they from small towns? small towns, and were

29:49.051 --> 29:53.735
they farm boys or ranch boys?

29:57.679 --> 30:01.703
Was DeWare Field House, was it built yet, the 
basketball?

30:05.146 --> 30:07.368
DeWare Field House, was it built yet? The football 
was played at Kyle Field. Was Dean Kyle still

30:14.215 --> 30:16.797
active? I know nothing. Tell me about Dean Kyle.

31:01.242 --> 31:26.010
Sure,

31:01.242 --> 31:26.010
I knew it. Maybe you're right about that. You know, 
I tried to port a fella back in. So then, you know, I

31:27.512 --> 31:28.593
don't worry about the bad things. So I tried to sort
