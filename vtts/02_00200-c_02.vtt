00:06.832 --> 00:28.452
I'm sure that things made some impressions and 
influenced me but I don't remember any single

00:06.832 --> 00:28.452
events that stand out as really shaping

00:06.832 --> 00:28.452
myself or my future. It was more of a lot of 
activities and events culminating in a

00:30.035 --> 00:53.678
pattern of activity and a pattern of efficiency, 
of commitment, of passion.

00:56.361 --> 00:57.882
I found out a lot of it trial and error just like you 
learn how to study that

00:59.077 --> 01:26.907
to be successful and to achieve things it takes 
because I didn't make I always knew that I wasn't

00:59.077 --> 01:26.907
intelligent but I always committed myself to 
getting things done well by sweat staying after it

01:28.085 --> 01:57.028
recognizing that if it's important then be 
persistent and get it done and I always had a the

01:28.085 --> 01:57.028
thrill of knowing that the education I got here had 
equipped me to serve in the entomology profession

01:57.700 --> 02:27.707
as an extension entomologist who worked with 
farmers and ranchers all over this state and

01:57.700 --> 02:27.707
homeowners on bug problems was important and that 
being able to solve those problems was what I

01:57.700 --> 02:27.707
wanted to be good at and never always was excited 
that I had the opportunity to do that and A&M gave me

01:57.700 --> 02:27.707
the knowledge and the ability to think through 
some of those problems having grown up in a small ag

02:28.160 --> 02:55.213
community I understood the importance of people 
and being able to help them with a lot of times what

02:28.160 --> 02:55.213
you would view as small issues but are extremely 
important to be able to get a solution to those

02:55.784 --> 03:01.610
that's practical and that they're capable of 
utilizing. If you could have all the people that

03:02.792 --> 03:16.406
were part of your A&M experience here today which 
ones would you most want to thank and why? Those

03:17.507 --> 03:24.475
that Dean Penberthy that advised you that cared 
that were there when you had at that moment some

03:24.995 --> 03:33.411
significant trials and tribulations in your 
life. Many of the entomology faculty that I

03:35.215 --> 03:45.535
learned about this industry and this profession 
from I remember several of our Wesley Foundation

03:46.274 --> 04:14.155
directors that were important from the 
standpoint of developing the religious beliefs

03:46.274 --> 04:14.155
and the

03:46.274 --> 04:14.155
guideposts to living in right and wrong as being 
important.

04:14.675 --> 04:41.627
was always a little bit of a rebel inside and at 
times it troubled me but it never changed much and

04:14.675 --> 04:41.627
so having people that support that chastise you 
when you get a little bit too far out of bounds but

04:42.248 --> 05:12.171
that supports you on some of those activities and 
efforts that you put a lot into and hope will be

04:42.248 --> 05:12.171
valuable to society or a group within society, 
whether it be cotton producers or beekeepers or

04:42.248 --> 05:12.171
livestock producers with screw-arm 
eradication, but just the opportunity to have met

05:13.012 --> 05:17.280
so many people that made a difference in others' 
lives. Those are the things that impress you and

05:19.384 --> 05:21.809
that stay with you. We're getting close to ending. 
What have I left out that you might have thought of

05:24.855 --> 05:32.570
before we started that you'd want to be sure to get 
in here? Have I left anything out?

05:41.210 --> 05:45.739
I'm sure that we have, but I can't think of anything 
right off the top. If we do, we can get them in the

05:45.759 --> 05:47.924
next edition.

05:51.391 --> 05:55.660
What did it mean to you, what has it meant to your 
life that you attended Texas A&M?

06:00.189 --> 06:02.374
Well, I'm certain that it, meant the opportunity 
to be an entomologist and to do those things that

06:02.827 --> 06:16.002
I've done that would not have been afforded if I had 
gone anywhere else or done something else.

06:18.685 --> 06:24.852
It's been such an integral part of my life since 55 
that I think it would be impossible for me to say

06:25.625 --> 06:34.175
what it would be like if I had gone to Texas Tech or to 
West Texas.

06:37.338 --> 06:52.155
The thing that I noticed when I was working up there 
at Tech in the summers and there were a lot of

06:37.338 --> 06:52.155
students around and the contacts I've had, 
there's a certain amount of discipline that you

06:37.338 --> 06:52.155
pick up at A&M that I'm afraid And I'm sure it 
doesn't even exist today in the civilian

06:53.114 --> 06:59.180
population here. But I'm reluctant to be critical 
of that segment of the population because the

07:01.262 --> 07:16.196
Corps only represents, what, less than 2,000 of 
the 43,000-something that we have here on campus.

07:17.437 --> 07:22.682
But those were difficult days. But they had a 
purpose. What are the qualities of being an Aggie,

07:27.204 --> 07:30.867
the key ingredients? I think it's a matter of 
self-confidence and of leadership qualities and

07:31.748 --> 07:52.146
of dedication and a commitment to a group of people 
that you learn to respect because they went

07:31.748 --> 07:52.146
through the same kinds of problems that you did. 
OK, next to the last question. Let's make believe

07:56.246 --> 08:03.373
that somebody walks up to you tomorrow morning, 
hands you a check for a million dollars with one

07:56.246 --> 08:03.373
condition. You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you 
decide what it is to be used for. In other words, if

08:11.702 --> 08:16.166
you could make a big gift to A&M, what would you want 
A&M to do? What would you want it? I'd want it for

08:17.328 --> 08:20.631
scholarships.

08:21.134 --> 08:21.595
For whom? I would probably, for undergraduates, 
and I'd probably be a little bit picky about the Ag,

08:21.715 --> 08:35.877
College of Agriculture and designating. How 
would you select the recipients?

08:42.970 --> 08:44.753
Number one, I probably wouldn't select them. I 
would ask the departments to do that. But would it

08:47.597 --> 08:53.124
be on the basis of their height or their good looks? 
I would want it to relate to

08:53.445 --> 09:01.516
the likelihood that they would be successful. So 
it would be based on academic qualifications.

09:06.730 --> 09:10.733
Probably interest in certain fields. Such as? 
Well, agriculture and entomology. And I think

09:15.077 --> 09:21.843
those are to be expected of someone who went 
through in that program. Last question. What

09:24.786 --> 09:28.389
feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

09:31.431 --> 09:35.775
It's an everlasting love that is reserved for your 
family, your God, and your school. And they're

09:41.553 --> 09:42.677
very comparable.
