WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:03.146
campus. Was Pinky Downs there yet? Pinky

00:05.931 --> 00:19.997
was in Temple, Texas at that time, but he had a 
daughter named Gray, Gray Downs, and she was a good

00:05.931 --> 00:19.997
looking thing. And Bobby Early, who was my partner 
in the tennis courts, used to go with Gray. He used

00:27.848 --> 00:28.729
to go to Temple. And Pinky at that time was still a 
big Aggie supporter, but he was in Temple then.

00:36.116 --> 00:40.099
Now, was Lupo, did he have a place? Yeah, Lupo had 
his bookshop up at the North Gate. And he had some

00:45.144 --> 00:47.126
nickname. Old Army? Old Army Lou? Yeah, Old Army 
Lou. And he was a good friend of Tiger Teague's, I

00:51.006 --> 00:55.134
remember. But this is before they both became 
famous. Yeah, right. But he had a bookstore, I'd

01:00.444 --> 01:07.939
say. Who were, did any famous people come to visit 
while you were? Yes. Roosevelt did. Describe

01:14.330 --> 01:15.572
that, please. You can see a picture of it. Yes, sir. 
I just did. Right. Roosevelt, Eliot Roosevelt was

01:20.239 --> 01:25.989
on the Board of Regents, President Roosevelt's 
son. President Roosevelt's son, Eliot, was on the

01:26.409 --> 01:32.880
Board, and he was the one that got Roosevelt there. 
And the governor of Texas then was Jimmy Allred.

01:36.484 --> 01:46.496
And so they came in this open touring car, and he 
reviewed the Corps, Roosevelt did. And I think

01:46.536 --> 01:54.345
they had a stand where he could hold onto the stand 
while he reviewed the Corps. Were you and your

01:54.605 --> 01:57.028
buddies aware of how crippled he was. Oh, yes. Oh, 
yeah. You were here? Oh, yeah, we did. Ed Lee, who

02:02.976 --> 02:08.483
was in that picture, Ed was a handsome guy. He was 
the captain of the basketball team, one of my best

02:08.503 --> 02:13.329
friends. But he was the corps commander when 
Roosevelt was there. And he's in the picture with

02:17.915 --> 02:22.101
Roosevelt. But we were all awed by the fact that the 
President of the United States would come down to

02:25.325 --> 02:30.478
review the Corps. Did he make a speech? He must 
have, but I don't recall it. I just recall it in

02:36.667 --> 02:47.561
passing in review because I was captain of E 
Battery and

02:36.667 --> 02:47.561
presenting arms before Roosevelt. I remember 
that. I wanted to be sure that I didn't stick my

02:49.203 --> 02:55.131
saber in the ground, you know. Was he on the campus 
very long? I don't think he was there very long. I

02:59.202 --> 03:05.234
think it was certainly a one-day visit. Did many 
people from off campus come to see him? Yes, a lot of

03:08.421 --> 03:12.349
people came for the review, for this review. Did 
any other famous people come to visit?

03:19.223 --> 03:20.946
Let me see who else they had. They had some famous 
bands that came to play for the Chordances. Such

03:30.881 --> 03:31.422
as? I think Tommy Dorsey, among others. And let me 
see. Tommy Dorsey and

03:39.774 --> 03:46.885
there was a I can't think of it right now.

03:57.547 --> 03:59.310
You go to summer camp which year? It was in my junior 
year. After your junior year? Yeah, right after

04:04.317 --> 04:06.981
your junior year, between your junior year and 
senior year. Where did you go? Went to Camp Bullis

04:07.683 --> 04:21.023
and we fired, to save money at that time, the field 
artillery had French 75s. And to save money, the

04:21.070 --> 04:35.749
Army had 37 millimeters on top of the 75, so that the 
shells were actually 37 millimeters. But you had

04:35.769 --> 04:42.758
the same thing, the firing and then correcting 
fire and so forth. And that summer camp duty lasted

04:42.822 --> 04:47.992
how long? I think it was either six or eight weeks, 
but right outside of San Antonio. How did that

04:55.708 --> 04:57.692
compare to Corps life? Well, I think core life 
prepared you for this. You lived in tents, and you

05:05.195 --> 05:26.278
had, I think, four guys to a tent, but there was no 
difference in chain of command or anything.

05:26.258 --> 05:28.805
And most people really enjoyed summer camp. Was it 
hot? Oh, yes. San Antonio at this time of the year,

05:32.796 --> 05:40.217
you know, it was...

05:40.619 --> 05:51.114
After the summer camp, that's when the attack 
officers evaluated people and that's when they

05:40.619 --> 05:51.114
decided who would be captain or whatever. So you 
didn't know when you went to summer camp that you

05:51.575 --> 05:55.961
were going to be company commander? Oh no, no, no. 
That wasn't decided until after that. Did you

06:00.167 --> 06:05.395
guys, did you Aggies feel at summer camp that you 
were better prepared than the ROTC boys from other

06:05.375 --> 06:07.417
places?

06:11.241 --> 06:11.962
Well, let's see. At our camp, I think we were the 
only ones there. I think we were just A&M people

06:14.945 --> 06:19.329
there. So who went to camp from A&M that year? 
Actually,

06:22.513 --> 06:28.118
all the juniors. All the juniors. Just the 
juniors. The juniors went. 300 maybe? 400? At

06:35.587 --> 06:49.554
least, I

06:35.587 --> 06:49.554
wouldn't say it was that many because our senior 
class had a total of 400 and there were others that

06:35.587 --> 06:49.554
went to other places.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.560
Now when you were at A&M, Everybody was in the Corps 
all four years? Oh yeah, everybody was in the

06:54.597 --> 06:55.799
Corps. All four years? All four years, right. But 
was everybody getting a commission? No, no. And

07:02.809 --> 07:11.781
actually there were some guys that were called day 
dodgers who lived in Bryan. They weren't in the

07:12.284 --> 07:13.806
Corps.

07:19.131 --> 07:28.400
But everybody was eligible for a commission who 
graduated. And so when I graduated, I was

07:29.061 --> 07:37.189
commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field 
Artillery Reserve. As far as you and your buddies

07:38.030 --> 07:41.093
felt, which of the branches of the Army were the 
most prestigious? What was the best to be in?

07:51.032 --> 07:56.822
Well, I really don't think at A&M anybody looked at 
the best there. They looked at what people were

07:56.862 --> 08:00.990
interested in, like the cavalry. They had the 
horse-drawn cavalry then, and people that liked

08:01.030 --> 08:05.157
to ride in the cavalry or in the field artillery 
because the field artillery was horse-drawn. And

08:10.509 --> 08:27.752
that

08:10.509 --> 08:27.752
was one of the reasons I liked the field artillery 
in addition to the fact that my uncle had been, was a

08:10.509 --> 08:27.752
captain, at that time was a captain in the field 
artillery. So did you ride a good bit? Oh, yeah.

08:30.395 --> 08:31.617
Where were the horses kept? They had stables. 
Where? A lot of horses. They were over on the other

08:35.021 --> 08:43.291
side of the railroad tracks, and you could check 
the horses out on the weekends, and we used to ride

08:35.021 --> 08:43.291
on the weekends. Where did you ride? Well, there 
were big planes out there that you could ride and

08:45.454 --> 08:53.504
really race and cavalry charge and all that sort of 
thing. Was it on college property? Oh, yeah, it was

08:55.947 --> 08:57.229
on college property. It was on the other side of the 
railroad track, on the west side. But that was a lot

09:02.076 --> 09:05.340
of fun. You had asked me to think about things that 
really had prepared me in later life, and one of

09:05.801 --> 09:16.116
them was horseback riding. And this has what 
happened in 1955. I was part of a group that went to

09:24.247 --> 09:31.778
Yemen and negotiated a deal with the old king of 
Yemen. And

09:32.018 --> 09:41.111
Life magazine wrote a story about it, which I've 
told you here. But the pertinent part is that as we

09:45.678 --> 09:52.567
flew to Cairo and then to Djibouti. And the King 
sent his airplane over to Dakota or DC-3 and picked

09:53.008 --> 10:00.418
us up. And we flew into Taiz, which was his summer 
palace. And there were no hotels there at all. And

10:07.190 --> 10:09.192
we stayed at the guest house. But when we called on 
the king, I told him through the interpreter that I

10:09.212 --> 10:21.323
admired the stallions that I had seen coming up to 
Taiz. And he asked me through the interpreter, did

10:21.343 --> 10:23.945
I like to ride? And I said, yes, I did. And so the next 
morning, he sent the fieriest stallion he had down

10:26.808 --> 10:33.994
there for me to ride, a horse called Rod. 
Fortunately, the horse had a snaffle bit and a curb

10:33.974 --> 10:40.121
bit. After fighting the horse for some time, I was 
finally able to get on him and ride him off. He was up

10:51.495 --> 10:59.104
on the balcony watching, and the king sent his 
horse down every morning for me to ride. So we were

10:59.455 --> 11:01.037
there six weeks. We finally got the concession. 
And so after the concession, our interpreter

11:03.179 --> 11:10.528
said, do you know why people got this concession? I 
said, no. He said, because you could ride that

11:11.549 --> 11:13.091
horse. And he figured that if, according to the 
interpreter, that if I had not lied about being

11:14.193 --> 11:21.261
able to ride, that we possibly would observe the 
things. So here, there was this deal in Yemen. Oh,

11:35.171 --> 11:41.224
thank you, thank you,

11:35.171 --> 11:41.224
thank you.

12:05.588 --> 12:12.617
But here's this Life magazine story in December of 
55. Ah, splendid.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.907
Splendid. But it's directly related to how did A&M 
help you in some

12:20.927 --> 12:29.077
fashion? The fact that I could ride that horse was

12:34.715 --> 12:38.721
But you were a horseman before you got to A&M. You 
could ride. Yeah, I could ride before then. I could

12:42.087 --> 12:43.249
ride before then. But actually, I took in a field 
artillery at that time. You had to jump and so

12:52.163 --> 12:55.006
forth, and they taught you. They taught you 
jumping and so forth. Although I could ride, I

12:57.990 --> 13:05.099
really learned the finer points of riding at A&M. 
Back in the spring of your junior year, you must

13:06.400 --> 13:12.407
have bought some senior boots. Right. Where did 
you get them? I got them at Lucchesi's, I think. Do

13:17.293 --> 13:20.517
you remember what they cost?

13:22.100 --> 13:23.382
I think it was $75. I'm not sure. And what did you 
feel like when you put them on to wear for the first

13:25.385 --> 13:37.823
time officially at Final Review that spring when 
you were getting ready to be a senior? Oh, I

13:38.985 --> 13:46.255
thought, you know, this is all that problem of 
being a fish and so forth has been worth it. And you

13:46.295 --> 13:49.941
bought your senior ring. Right. Do you remember 
what it cost? I don't recall. I remember I got it

13:55.265 --> 13:57.668
from Fort Worth. I believe Balfour. I'm not sure. I 
think that was the name of it. Do you have any good

14:05.376 --> 14:07.438
ring stories? Yes. I've got one.

14:16.808 --> 14:27.707
I lost my ring and I was on a Southwest Airlines 
flight to, let me get you the story. Don't forget

14:28.989 --> 14:31.813
you're plugged in. Oh, I better take this off. So 
you lost your ring. Was it on the Southwest

14:37.092 --> 14:39.035
Airlines? Right, it was on the Southwest 
Airlines. Was it ever found? No, and actually I

14:42.220 --> 14:53.397
wrote to Herb Kelleher, head of Southwest, and 
believe it or not he wrote this letter back.

15:00.211 --> 15:03.997
How splendid, how splendid. They never found it. 
Did you buy another one? No, I haven't. So that was

15:07.963 --> 15:15.574
your only... That was my... All right, do you have 
any other ring stories of where you were somewhere

15:07.963 --> 15:15.574
on the other side of the world or something? Yeah, 
that's in this write-up. I say it in this that...

15:22.685 --> 15:24.107
They knew it was an Aggie ring? Oh, yeah, yeah. 
They...

15:40.829 --> 16:00.846
Actually, I was in Algeria on a consulting job when 
the war in Algeria was going on, and I was staying at

15:40.829 --> 16:00.846
a hotel there in Algiers. and everybody had 
evacuated. There were lots of bombing and so forth

16:03.713 --> 16:07.242
going on during that revolution. And there were 
just a few people in the hotel, and I was at the bar

16:08.305 --> 16:16.084
one night, and was sitting there and ordered a 
drink. And this guy saw my ring and

16:20.394 --> 16:26.360
he said, what class were you in? And I told him. And 
we introduced ourselves. I forget what class he

16:29.603 --> 16:34.408
was in, but we were the only about four people in our 
hotel.

16:37.010 --> 16:38.051
But he saw the ring.

16:40.754 --> 16:46.780
When you and your classmates were getting ready to 
graduate from Texas A&M, What kind of world did you

16:47.131 --> 16:55.774
think you were going to be going into and how well 
prepared did you and your friends think you were? I

16:56.463 --> 16:58.086
thought we were well prepared. It was actually the 
beginning of a second depression, 37 and 38. So

17:07.702 --> 17:10.967
jobs were very scarce at that time. And so we knew 
that

17:11.889 --> 17:20.583
we would...

17:20.724 --> 17:22.707
I'd say most of us thought that we were well 
prepared to be in a competitive world. And

17:26.029 --> 17:35.762
I thought I'd be better prepared if I got another 
degree from MIT, which turned out to be true.

17:39.907 --> 17:51.462
But the A&M experience, I think, prepared you for a 
competitive world. Now you graduated in the

17:51.627 --> 17:58.258
spring of 37, so there was no war yet. No. And the 
tough thing was simply economics, jobs and paying

18:00.482 --> 18:08.957
the bills and so forth. How did you get admitted to 
MIT? Did you think that up or did someone recommend

18:15.995 --> 18:17.197
No, I applied. But did an A&M faculty member 
suggest you? No, this was my idea all the time. As I

18:23.128 --> 18:32.164
say, I had wanted to get a graduate degree from MIT 
all the time. So I applied and was accepted. And I

18:35.654 --> 18:40.980
remember there were several other A&M graduates 
in my class. One of them was Dr. Silvey, was the head

18:41.240 --> 18:48.228
of the Electroengineering Department. And his 
son, his name was Silvey, he applied, and he was

18:48.268 --> 18:53.414
accepted. But I think all of us that applied, I 
think there were about five or six that applied for

18:54.355 --> 19:05.087
MIT, and we were all accepted, which showed that 
that they regarded the academic background. When

19:09.735 --> 19:12.760
you got there, did you all do well academically up 
there? We all did well. We all graduated, got our

19:13.401 --> 19:15.224
degrees. Describe the formalities of your senior 
spring. Commencement, the final review, and so

19:23.738 --> 19:29.107
forth. Right. Well, we had a ring dance. At Sebesa? 
At Sebesa Hall, right. We had a ring dance, and I

19:37.560 --> 19:50.260
think I had Lillian Street down as my guest, and 
then we had final review. Do you remember who the

19:52.304 --> 19:54.447
reviewing officer was? I don't remember who he 
was. It was on the drill field. Right, it was on the

19:58.391 --> 19:59.472
drill field. It's the same as it is now. Did any 
family or close friends come? My sister came. She

20:08.822 --> 20:13.027
came, and she was actually the date of a good friend 
of mine. And she came. My mother didn't come. What

20:19.554 --> 20:20.455
about commencement? Where was it held? That was 
held in... Gann Hall, which was an impressive,

20:24.920 --> 20:31.594
impressive thing. At

20:32.476 --> 20:42.658
that point, how well prepared did you feel A&M had 
made you? I thought at commencement, I thought I

20:43.870 --> 20:52.392
was where I wanted to be at that time, 
competitively and so forth. What creates this

20:53.535 --> 20:56.924
Aggie spirit, Aggie pride? What builds that? I've 
given some thought to that and I think what it did in

20:59.598 --> 21:19.243
my era was the fact that as fish you went through a 
very tough year in which you shared a lot of

21:19.223 --> 21:34.964
experiences, some of which were painful and some, 
though, which you had a lot of fun doing. And that, I

21:36.146 --> 21:45.298
think that, plus the fact that you were they 
emphasized, I'd say, duty on a country, which you

21:45.278 --> 21:58.081
never forgot. And

21:58.101 --> 22:08.099
that bonding is somewhat different than other 
schools. Are there some key the events of being in

22:10.439 --> 22:13.184
the Corps and so forth. But are there some other 
events that contribute to that bonding?

22:21.260 --> 22:28.414
Well, I would say your

22:30.622 --> 22:35.608
relationships with whatever team you were on. A

22:37.070 --> 22:42.657
sort of special people you can't forget. I'll 
never forget the guys I was on the basketball team

22:42.757 --> 22:46.401
with. And

22:46.441 --> 22:54.051
I might just tell you a connection to that story. 
When we went over to play Centenary one time in

22:54.091 --> 22:59.397
basketball, We went in the coach's cars. We were 
unloading our baggage at the Washington Urey

23:03.410 --> 23:12.520
Hotel, and one of the bellboys, a black bellboy, 
was helping us unload. And he looked at me and he

23:13.381 --> 23:15.684
said, what is you? Is you the mascot?

23:21.270 --> 23:26.215
I told him, no, I actually played on the team.

23:27.056 --> 23:32.202
Did you all have, in your day, did you all go to 
muster? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Where was it held? Let's

23:37.361 --> 23:37.901
see. Muster was,

23:39.664 --> 23:50.058
I think it was held at the administration 
building, in front of the administration

23:39.664 --> 23:50.058
building. The, you're saying the? The old 
administration building. The old, okay. I think

23:54.505 --> 23:57.349
it was held there, but I'm really not sure. But at 
that point, I read out the names of the guys who had

23:59.772 --> 24:03.478
died that year. And by the time you were a senior, 
was Silver Tap still staying in your room? Oh,

24:09.989 --> 24:11.451
yeah. It was still the same. It was still the same. 
At commencement, was every name called and every

24:14.677 --> 24:18.503
hand shaken? Oh, yes. Yes, at commencement, every 
name was called. You went up on the stage and Dr.

24:21.027 --> 24:25.695
Walton gave you a diploma, and shook your hand. And 
are those shared experiences key to Aggie spirit?

24:34.086 --> 24:36.188
I think it's part of it, yeah. Of course, other 
colleges and so forth have similar type things,

24:37.550 --> 24:54.231
except that I think the difference is the hardship 
part that you go through at the very beginning. All

24:55.038 --> 24:58.962
right, now we've got about a half dozen questions, 
and these are all the serious ones. Looking back,

25:00.324 --> 25:06.391
what did you learn at A&M that has been important in 
your life? Summarize what being an Aggie, why it's

25:07.072 --> 25:10.375
important.

25:16.802 --> 25:24.471
The important things, I think, of being an Aggie 
was

25:26.830 --> 25:34.444
is one that you had an excellent education, 
excellent basic education.

25:35.420 --> 25:58.305
Two, that you went through a training period in 
which

25:35.420 --> 25:58.305
certain moral values were emphasized, such as 
duty, honor, country, and truth. so that in the

25:58.285 --> 26:12.919
real world, people who know about Aggies, people 
who are Aggies, know that when they hire a guy, he

26:13.473 --> 26:20.503
will

26:13.473 --> 26:20.503
have certain qualities. One, that he's got a good 
basic education. Two, that he's able to get along

26:24.108 --> 26:28.134
with other men. And three, that character has been 
emphasized in his training. I

26:35.545 --> 26:57.460
found this to be true in my relations with Aggie 
employers, but also with the executives of other

26:35.545 --> 26:57.460
companies.

26:57.480 --> 27:01.587
If you were a consultant to Texas A&M's leaders 
today, What advice would you give them regarding

27:03.153 --> 27:07.638
A&M's future?

27:11.983 --> 27:30.645
Well, I was a member of the Century Council and was a 
member of the Target 2000 project in which I was

27:11.983 --> 27:30.645
exposed to the answer to your question. And I think 
that

27:30.625 --> 27:48.104
both of those reports really were pretty 
comprehensive as to A&M, what they should follow.

27:48.785 --> 27:55.012
And I think Dr. Bowen has carried that out pretty 
well. And of course, Earl Rudder was probably the

27:58.773 --> 28:11.803
greatest president A&M ever had, and he carried 
forward the things that had been recommended. For

28:12.070 --> 28:15.894
example, though, how large should A&M's 
enrollment become? As of right now, I think the

28:16.775 --> 28:35.153
enrollment should be static, 40,000 plus or 
whatever, because I think if you try to increase it

28:16.775 --> 28:35.153
more, you diminish the quality of teaching there. 
And how should the students be selected? I think

28:41.028 --> 28:53.528
the students should be elected on a competitive 
basis, and there should be certain minimum

28:41.028 --> 28:53.528
qualities. Whereas I understand the problem of 
the minorities and

28:57.582 --> 29:18.664
certainly want to emphasize diversity, but I 
think that the standards for them should be the

28:57.582 --> 29:18.664
same as anybody else.

29:21.206 --> 29:25.851
So there's a difference of opinion on that, but 
that's the way I feel. I've been on the Easterwood

29:26.320 --> 29:32.409
Scholarship Board, and we've had discussions 
about that. We've had some candidates come up who

29:34.652 --> 29:47.670
were submitted to get scholarships.

29:47.650 --> 30:16.392
And somebody, let's say, that had some minority 
applicant who had an SAT of 1050, even though he

29:47.650 --> 30:16.392
might have been in the top 10% of his class, and 
maybe in a school that is somewhat inferior as to

29:47.650 --> 30:16.392
its academic status, it hasn't been really fair to 
have that particular person, to me it seems, to go

30:16.372 --> 30:29.305
up against

30:16.372 --> 30:29.305
somebody who has a 1250. But what I would think is to 
make some arrangement where the person goes to a

30:31.207 --> 30:41.518
junior college under some sort of a Otherwise, 
he's going to be, he'll flunk out and be

30:41.498 --> 30:50.797
discouraged and probably end up on drugs. But I 
think the junior college thing is the way to go,

30:52.500 --> 30:56.588
probably. what parts or what programs, what 
activities are dearest to your heart, and I'll

30:56.973 --> 31:18.458
phrase that in a different way, if you were going to 
make a truly substantial gift to Texas A&M, what

30:56.973 --> 31:18.458
would you want that gift to be used to do?

31:19.552 --> 31:33.304
I think that particular gift would be the 
Petroleum Engineering School there is, and of

31:19.552 --> 31:33.304
course the U.S. News is rated number one in the 
country, number two is Texas, number three is

31:19.552 --> 31:33.304
Stanford. But I'd say the gift would be to the 
Petroleum Engineering School to maintain its

31:33.904 --> 31:40.630
standard.

31:44.052 --> 31:46.134
Okay, fun. What is your favorite Aggie Good Bull 
story?

31:56.626 --> 31:57.541
There's gotta be some
