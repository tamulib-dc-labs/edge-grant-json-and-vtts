00:02.208 --> 00:14.666
It's July the 7th, and I'm in the Connolly building 
and have the pleasure and honor of chatting with

00:02.208 --> 00:14.666
Daniel Hernandez about his Texas A&M student 
experiences. Daniel, say a sentence to test your

00:14.686 --> 00:16.528
mic. Hello, I'm here, and I'm glad to be here with 
Haskell Munroe. I want to introduce yourself to

00:22.492 --> 00:27.779
someone who may read the transcript or hear the 
tape. Describe briefly your family background,

00:28.620 --> 00:42.958
from where, when, and what brought you to this 
community, and where to high school, and so forth.

00:43.098 --> 00:45.541
My mom came originally from Mexico City. My dad was 
born in Hondo, Texas, and There's a 20 years

00:51.905 --> 00:54.428
difference between a mom and dad. A mom and dad met 
each other in Taylor, Texas. My mom's brothers and

01:01.255 --> 01:14.390
dad had come to Texas in the early part of the 
century, trying to find their way into a better

01:01.255 --> 01:14.390
situation. And they stayed here for about a year or 
two. Then they sent for my mom and her her mother and

01:22.077 --> 01:26.386
sisters, which has been the pattern for many, many 
years. And they came, and my dad met them. He was

01:31.818 --> 01:33.081
born in Texas. And by the time my dad met them, my dad 
had been married three times. had three children

01:38.952 --> 01:45.462
from his prior marriage, and met my mom in Taylor, 
Texas. And then they married and moved to

01:46.504 --> 01:52.353
Wheelock, Texas, which is in Robertson County. 
And there my mom and dad were involved in

01:53.294 --> 02:00.645
sharecropping there at the Seal Farm. And they 
were there for several years. All along this time,

02:06.458 --> 02:15.785
there was a gentleman by the name of Pablo 
Hernandez, who was a friend of my dad's, an older

02:06.458 --> 02:15.785
gentleman, much older than my dad. And he would 
always share the gospel with my dad about having a

02:20.178 --> 02:24.103
changed life, a new spiritual life. And my dad said 
he would sort of humor him and go with him to the

02:24.223 --> 02:34.275
church functions because they had good cover dish 
dinners and suppers and lunches. And so he would do

02:34.335 --> 02:37.219
that on Sundays. And eventually something 
happened where it really caught hold of my dad

02:37.459 --> 02:44.768
spiritually, and it really transformed his life. 
This is important because this was the pivotal

02:45.271 --> 02:52.241
point that sort of began to make him think 
differently about himself and the family. As a

02:53.503 --> 03:09.325
result of this new way of thinking, a new thinking 
of himself and the family, and by this time I think

02:53.503 --> 03:09.325
there must have been about four children from my 
mom's, that my mom had had with him, and he had his

02:53.503 --> 03:09.325
three other children who by this time were already 
adults. And... They were often married, but my dad

03:11.984 --> 03:25.877
decided to ask the owner of the land if he would 
drive my sister and drop her off at schoolhouse, my

03:11.984 --> 03:25.877
sister Isabel. And for some reason, the gentleman 
said no. Or it couldn't happen, it wouldn't

03:34.004 --> 03:35.706
happen, whatever. And so that really, really 
touched my dad. It just changed. He told me later

03:40.857 --> 03:50.873
that it was weird because had it been before he had 
had this transformed new life, spiritual

03:40.857 --> 03:50.873
relationship with God, it would have just been one 
of those other setbacks. Plus, he said, I probably

03:52.475 --> 03:54.919
wouldn't have even asked him. But he said that 
night he went out to the cotton field and just sort

03:54.939 --> 04:00.788
of cried and just said, you know, there's got to be 
something better. And so somehow he just felt like

04:01.870 --> 04:07.118
there was a need to move and so on. They, within a 
couple of weeks or so, picked up their stuff, made

04:07.621 --> 04:15.069
the decision, and moved to Bryan, 20 miles away. 
And so they came to Bryan. And at that time, this is

04:19.253 --> 04:36.632
about in the 30s, late 30s, early 40s, my dad, 
having developed a real spiritual reawakening,

04:19.253 --> 04:36.632
he started working. but also started preaching, 
having church services at his house. And so he

04:41.340 --> 04:45.625
would have church services and work at the Texas 
Highway Department. And just little by little,

04:46.406 --> 05:01.443
and since agriculture was also part of his 
background, he began to pay contracts with some of

04:46.406 --> 05:01.443
the local farmers and landowners in the Brazos 
Bottom and would contract labor to work in the

04:46.406 --> 05:01.443
fields. And that's what my brothers and I did all 
along for the most part of our younger life. My

05:07.662 --> 05:23.466
oldest brother, my oldest two brothers, and my 
sister, Isabel, or all my brothers and I finished

05:07.662 --> 05:23.466
high school at Bryan High, which then used to be 
Stephen F. Austin in Bryan. The first person in our

05:24.768 --> 05:28.334
family to finish school was my sister, Isabel. 
Because there was no no college here or A&M did not

05:31.270 --> 05:47.833
accept women, this was back in the early 50s, she 
went to Baldwin-McKinsey College, McKinsey

05:31.270 --> 05:47.833
Baldwin College, a business college here, a year 
program or something for secretarial training,

05:31.270 --> 05:47.833
and that's where my sister went. My older 
brothers, my older brother Mike, finished high

05:48.695 --> 06:01.092
school probably about 54, sometime around that 
time, 56, and he was 21 years old when he finished

05:48.695 --> 06:01.092
high school. My brother Andrew, who finished 
about a year later or two years later, was also 21.

06:06.789 --> 06:15.119
And the reason they ended up being 21 when they 
finished was because my dad would take them out

06:06.789 --> 06:15.119
from school and they would work the fields. During 
this interim, what they would end up doing is they

06:16.421 --> 06:21.747
would work the fields here and also go to Lubbock, 
Texas and work. And very sometimes there was a six

06:22.468 --> 06:29.537
months missed or a year missed, but they did miss a 
lot of school, so they were older students. And...

06:31.818 --> 06:42.170
My brother Mike was the first one to start Texas 
A&M, and I would say that was probably like 1956,

06:31.818 --> 06:42.170
57, and starting the Corps of Cadets. Right, and so 
you finished high school what year? I finished

06:45.934 --> 06:57.927
high school in 1969, five brothers later, and I was 
the last of ten children, and there were six boys

06:45.934 --> 06:57.927
and four girls. One of my sisters died when she was 
like two years old, Um, and, um, so, uh, my brother,

07:01.957 --> 07:11.428
Mike, uh, started going to college, uh, right 
after high school. And, um, at first it was a real

07:12.389 --> 07:26.265
struggle for my dad, uh, though he wanted him to go 
to educated, but you know, the reality set in that

07:12.389 --> 07:26.265
they were less, there's less time for them to work 
with him and work the fields. Fortunately for him,

07:26.725 --> 07:30.850
he had a lot of other sons coming in along the line. 
so every two years there was a new child and we were

07:31.268 --> 07:57.495
six boys so uh... fortunately there was one of us 
becoming of age to be able to drive or work so that

07:31.268 --> 07:57.495
made it easier but my dad had to find a new 
definition of what i guess one would call a man

07:31.268 --> 07:57.495
because in his mind a man was someone who worked 
with his hands was sweating was always out in the

07:31.268 --> 07:57.495
fields was and how his sons who he admired a lot, 
were now in a clean shirt, no sweat. It was working

08:04.243 --> 08:07.146
and trying to go to college. Even though while they 
were going to college, they did work at the

08:07.867 --> 08:12.511
International Shoe Factory here. But it was a 
different kind. And I think at first my dad had...

08:17.696 --> 08:23.922
It was tough for him because it was this whole 
notion that they were becoming... not that rugged

08:24.273 --> 08:31.202
person that he was accustomed to them being, even 
though they had lived through that for most of

08:24.273 --> 08:31.202
their lives. At about what age did you become aware 
that college would be expected of you? I would say

08:37.791 --> 08:43.999
when I was probably about eight or nine years old. 
And it's interesting because we would still work

08:44.820 --> 08:47.864
in the cotton fields. We would go to migrant 
workers. We would go into Lubbock and Brownfield,

08:49.806 --> 08:52.710
Texas, We would leave like in late May, spend all 
through August chopping cotton. And my dad would

09:00.143 --> 09:01.925
take the whole family with us. And then we would 
come back for about a month. And then late

09:05.848 --> 09:10.673
September, we would go back to the same farm and 
then pick the cotton. And I remember when I was

09:11.974 --> 09:22.984
probably about nine years old, I began to sign my 
name Daniel Hernandez, class of 73. Now, I

09:23.791 --> 09:27.757
remember the teachers thought of thinking that 
funny. But my brothers were going to school. And I

09:32.465 --> 09:45.826
remember telling the teachers in Lockville, 
excuse me, I forgot the name of the school

09:32.465 --> 09:45.826
where I went to. But we would tell them, I would tell 
them I have brothers that were Aggies. And of

09:51.550 --> 09:55.920
course, it was incongruent because she knew we 
were farm workers. But I think one time I came with

09:57.443 --> 10:03.095
an Aggie t-shirt and might have. Right. Now, you 
left here before the spring semester was over to go

10:03.997 --> 10:09.930
work. Well, normally we were right after school. 
Right after school. All right. Now in the fall,

10:13.757 --> 10:15.980
we'd be picking cotton. Right. And would y'all 
just be absent from the Bryan schools? We were

10:20.066 --> 10:30.062
absent from the Bryan schools, and my dad would 
enroll us in Lubbock in

10:20.066 --> 10:30.062
the schools, but sometimes... He would keep us 
about two or three weeks when we first got there

10:30.262 --> 10:35.349
because he needed us to get him started. And so then 
we'd go for about a month, a month and a half, and

10:36.090 --> 10:42.638
then he'd pull us out about two or three weeks 
before the semester was over. So we ended up going

10:43.379 --> 10:50.128
to school about six weeks and at the front end, 
missing three weeks, at the back end, another

10:43.379 --> 10:50.128
three weeks. And so none of us ever failed. We all 
made the grade and made good grades over there and

10:53.253 --> 10:57.819
made good grades here. And my brother, Mike, who 
was the first one to go through this whole process

10:59.692 --> 11:05.279
was the one that really just drove it into us. You 
got to study. We couldn't. My mom was very, very

11:07.041 --> 11:15.571
faithful to the Bible and would not let us read 
funny books. So at home, we could not read funny

11:15.851 --> 11:17.934
books. We either had to be reading the Bible. We 
were one of the first to get a television here in

11:24.616 --> 11:34.048
Bryan, and I guess in 1956 we must have gotten the 
first TV, but we could not watch TV during the week.

11:35.570 --> 11:42.378
My brother would not let us watch TV during the week 
because we had to, and we couldn't read funny

11:35.570 --> 11:42.378
books, so we left the Bible. And so on weekends we 
could watch TV. When I became a sophomore in high

11:47.364 --> 11:53.712
school, my older brother then, who was now at home, 
because every time one would leave, another

11:54.248 --> 11:58.094
brother would take over. My brother David would 
let us watch one hour of TV a night. Now, did those

12:04.283 --> 12:10.812
brothers assume a fatherly role? Were they the 
male rule enforcer? My dad was the ultimate

12:18.163 --> 12:21.808
enforcer, but if it ever got to him, It's because 
things were pretty bad, and so we never wanted to

12:22.295 --> 12:27.682
have things get to my dad. But the way my dad reared 
us was that if your older brother's there, he's in

12:28.283 --> 12:35.093
charge. And so my dad was working a lot, and so that 
was the way it was. If my brother that was two years

12:38.257 --> 12:45.026
older than me was there and I was 10 and he's 12, he 
was a guy that I had to obey. What might have been the

12:45.427 --> 12:49.833
punishment if you had broken some of those rules? 
Uh... Probably a good whacking in the bottom.

12:58.023 --> 13:04.753
Though I'll have to admit, my dad was very lenient 
on me, and he kind of did and spanked me. And my other

13:04.773 --> 13:07.177
brothers weren't too crazy about that. But my 
brothers were the ones that put the fear in me.

13:10.382 --> 13:17.533
Because my dad may not have spanked me, but my 
brother Mike always had a belt around his chair.

13:17.553 --> 13:19.977
And he says, you see this belt right here? Do you 
want some of that belt? And of course I'd say no. And

13:23.643 --> 13:31.691
every once in a while I might cry mercy for my dad, 
but my brothers were pretty much the ones that were

13:23.643 --> 13:31.691
the disciplinarians. All right, so now you 
graduated high school what year? 1969. 69. And do

13:35.074 --> 13:41.180
you remember what part of the year you applied for 
admission to A&M? Oh, no, it was probably in the

13:41.821 --> 13:43.983
spring. I was pretty nervous because I was the last 
one to have started A&M, and I got admitted. And I

13:53.182 --> 14:01.449
was nervous when I started in September because I 
kind of felt a burden on me because I thought, you

13:53.182 --> 14:01.449
know, here all my brothers have gone. By that time, 
I think two or three had already graduated, and the

14:01.509 --> 14:06.214
others were still in school. And it was like, are we 
going to, you know, am I going to make it? And, of

14:11.378 --> 14:17.824
course, it was more the anxiety of I wanted to make 
sure that I did as good as they had. Now, your senior

14:17.973 --> 14:23.642
class at Stephen F. Austin, about how many? 400 
students. Okay. And was there a large number of

14:28.169 --> 14:30.593
them going to A&M? You know,

14:31.635 --> 14:36.182
I don't know how many. I know a lot of my classmates 
did. Percentage-wise, I couldn't tell you. But

14:41.130 --> 14:43.153
you had a number of acquaintances. Oh, yes, I had a 
number of acquaintances. All right. Did you have

14:46.465 --> 14:49.889
one or two close buddies that were going to A&M? 
Yeah. I had two or three friends of mine that I had

14:52.392 --> 14:58.880
played ball with, David Scasta and Ronald Spees.

15:01.964 --> 15:11.055
These were guys that I had gone to elementary 
school with, junior high and high school, and

15:01.964 --> 15:11.055
pretty bright guys, and they ended up coming to A&M 
also. All right. So describe now the routine. of

15:14.673 --> 15:18.276
registering and going to your first classes the 
first year? Well, I

15:19.377 --> 15:25.403
remember registering, which was pretty 
straightforward. And I remember getting a letter

15:25.483 --> 15:29.206
of admission. And I guess by the time I was going to 
school, for me to go to A&M was important, but it was

15:29.907 --> 15:43.819
not one of those things that people jumped up and 
down because it was expected of me. I was just doing

15:44.390 --> 15:46.293
the next thing in line. And so, not that it lost its 
favor, it was just, it was expected. I guess my

15:52.002 --> 16:01.316
first days of class, I remember not feeling 
nervous, but just feeling excited about going to

15:52.002 --> 16:01.316
school. I did see some of my friends in some of my 
bigger classes, like history and English. Now,

16:05.843 --> 16:09.469
where was registration held then, Sabisa or G. 
Raleigh? Because wasn't this still the time when

16:10.867 --> 16:15.858
you stood in line and went from counter to counter? 
You had to go to counter to counter. I don't

16:17.522 --> 16:19.065
remember, quite frankly. You don't remember any 
unusual? No. No, it was pretty straightforward.

16:24.438 --> 16:25.340
Now, you lived at home. I lived at home, as my 
brothers had before me. Did you encounter any kind

16:29.243 --> 16:41.716
of experiences that first fall about being a 
minority student or anything else? No. No, I

16:44.079 --> 16:44.700
didn't. I think because, I mean, I had played 
around on campus. I had watched Randy Madsen set

16:50.265 --> 16:53.989
the world record. I rode my bike over here. So I was 
like at home. What I think I found that was kind of

16:58.032 --> 17:12.508
unusual is some of the students were not used to 
seeing a lot of Hispanics going to school, and I

16:58.032 --> 17:12.508
think for them it was kind of, it was just a 
difference. No one ever said negative derogatory

17:13.469 --> 17:25.783
things, but there was a sense of disconnectedness 
with some of the students. But as far as a campus, or

17:27.732 --> 17:38.302
feeling a part of the campus, that was something I 
always felt a part of the campus, and it was always,

17:27.732 --> 17:38.302
you know, as far as I was concerned, you know, that 
was my campus. I'd been there since I was a kid. Did,

17:40.084 --> 17:49.392
now, you have always struck me as being a person I 
would call a mainstreamer, that instead of being

17:40.084 --> 17:49.392
on the outside, you've always tried to be on the 
inside. Was that deliberate with you? Did you

17:52.495 --> 17:55.478
think about that, or was that just normal? You mean 
regarding just the political concepts or ideas

17:55.880 --> 18:00.806
related? Well, that was just part of my family 
upbringing. I think having been a part of the

18:03.909 --> 18:10.316
United Methodist Church taught us a lot of 
leadership skills. All my brothers and I were

18:11.638 --> 18:17.925
leaders in church conferences, which included 
several hundred students and youth. And we were

18:17.945 --> 18:20.968
always doing public speaking. We were always in 
the middle, always expected to be in the middle.

18:24.601 --> 18:33.051
And so there was an expectation among the 
Hernandez boys and girls to be in the middle and to

18:24.601 --> 18:33.051
participate. So when coming here, I ended up 
pursuing some of the same kind of activities. Can

18:40.040 --> 18:43.965
you share any recollections of that first 
semester of classes? What did you take? From whom?

18:45.987 --> 18:48.050
Any experiences? Oh, I remember taking a class 
from... My freshman math class from, you may have

18:54.773 --> 19:05.669
to help me here, he's at A&M right now as their 
assistant provost. Bill Perry? No, the guy who

19:06.630 --> 19:08.894
handles all the fiscal affairs.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.101
I forget his name. He was my math professor in 
Algebra 102. And then they threw in all of the

19:22.060 --> 19:51.021
engineers along with all the social science and 
liberal liberal arts and of course I was there I was

19:22.060 --> 19:51.021
doing well because I had done well in high school 
but I was with a bunch of engineers who could just

19:22.060 --> 19:51.021
eat that math up and that was you know that was the 
first time I had really was facing the idea of

19:22.060 --> 19:51.021
making a C in math and it kind of like shocked me 
because it wasn't that I didn't understand it it

19:22.060 --> 19:51.021
was just The material was going faster than I'd 
been used to because these kids were picking it up a

19:51.457 --> 19:56.805
lot faster. I had my English teacher. I remember 
this quite vividly, and I forget her name, but it

20:00.451 --> 20:06.360
was the year that Midnight Cowboy came out. And the 
first English paper, my brothers had told me, the

20:07.562 --> 20:18.038
first paper you write, you're going to probably 
make an F on it because they're going to write it up,

20:07.562 --> 20:18.038
and you're going to just, like, you don't know how 
to write. Well, that's what happened. I mean, I

20:19.482 --> 20:20.183
wrote it. I think I made a D, barely made a D. And then 
my teacher talked to me, and so we were supposed to

20:20.203 --> 20:32.822
write a narrative on the movie, a movie we saw or 
some book. So I did it on the movie Midnight Cowboy.

20:38.130 --> 20:42.997
And after all the critique that she had given me, 
she came back, and I did a, you know, I loved it. The

20:43.378 --> 20:46.202
movie was great, and I came back with an A. And, I 
mean, that just gave me the confidence that I

20:47.448 --> 20:52.637
needed, and it made me feel great. And so it really 
helped me pick up a lot of my feeling about feeling

20:53.579 --> 21:04.057
good about myself and that I was going to do well in 
school. My history professor, Ashcraft.

21:09.827 --> 21:10.468
Alan Ashcraft. Alan Ashcraft, my history 
professor. And he was funny. He was joyful. He was a

21:16.762 --> 21:18.684
delight to listen to. And he really made history 
come alive. Did he have a nickname? You know how

21:25.834 --> 21:27.296
students gave it, everybody? No. I didn't know of 
one if he had one. No, no, no. But he had a very

21:30.942 --> 21:33.986
interesting mannerism about how he talked. He was 
a big fella, but he had a very soft way of talking.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.173
And no... But he, of course, in those days, using 
the word damn and hell was not very common in public

21:39.575 --> 21:46.846
schools. But when he used it, it just made the 
class, the word came in at the right time. You took,

21:53.095 --> 21:55.659
do you remember how many hours you took that first 
semester? First semester, I think I took 13 hours.

21:58.002 --> 21:58.483
13. And you did okay in terms of? Yeah. I think I made 
like a, I came out with a 2.8, 2.9 maybe. I can't

22:07.316 --> 22:07.877
remember now. You weren't in the Corps. No. Did you 
get involved in any Aggie activities that fall?

22:17.125 --> 22:19.487
That fall semester I did not because I was working. 
What I would do, I'd have my classes Mondays,

22:20.588 --> 22:36.362
Wednesdays, Fridays in the morning, and then at 2 
o'clock in the afternoon I would work at Alinko,

22:20.588 --> 22:36.362
and I would work from 2 to 10 in the evening. And that 
was my routine. And then what did you do on Tuesday

22:38.245 --> 22:40.308
and Thursday? Tuesday and Thursday I'd study. Oh, 
okay. And I'd go work, but I would study. So you were

22:46.718 --> 22:54.189
working three eight-hour days, three eight-hour 
shifts, Monday, Wednesday, Friday? Monday,

22:54.330 --> 22:57.935
Wednesday, Friday, but also I went on Tuesday and 
Thursdays to work. Oh, so you worked a full week.

23:00.479 --> 23:00.779
Yes. And one thing I didn't tell you, the reason why 
I worked a full week time was because uh my oldest

23:04.523 --> 23:33.417
brother mike when he was like 25 he and andrew 
decided to help my parents and they purchased a

23:04.523 --> 23:33.417
home for my parents and the way it worked it was that 
the boys and the girls we would all pay for the house

23:04.523 --> 23:33.417
so as we became of age at 18 we would all pick up the 
slack so it just worked out beautifully because we

23:04.523 --> 23:33.417
were responsible for paying the mortgage and the 
utilities for a house And then, of course,

23:33.818 --> 23:40.465
anything else, if we bought a car, which I decided 
to buy a car later, all of that was up on us. So we had

23:40.525 --> 23:51.455
to be working in order to meet the obligation of the 
house and utilities, which nowadays is hardly

23:40.525 --> 23:51.455
anything, but in those days it was enough. Do you 
remember what your A&M bill was? Do you remember

23:53.878 --> 23:55.239
what a semester cost? Oh, I'm thinking something 
like, hmm. Three or four hundred dollars. And you

24:03.045 --> 24:05.569
paid that yourself? Yes. And how did you get to the 
campus that first semester? The first semester, I

24:11.878 --> 24:19.310
ended up, my dad had a, oh no, I ended up going with my 
brothers. I ended up going with my brothers

24:20.512 --> 24:30.066
because we were going to class, we all had to, my 
other brother Moises had to also meet a We worked

24:30.502 --> 24:32.585
together at the same place. So we would set up our 
classes. Monday was the Fridays in the morning,

24:34.507 --> 24:38.492
and then we would drive. The year later, the summer 
of 1970 is when I bought me my own vehicle, a used

24:39.072 --> 24:48.504
vehicle, and then from there I had my own schedule. 
And what advice did those older brothers give you

24:48.524 --> 24:52.489
about being a college student? Well, you know, 
it's interesting because advice was just

24:54.191 --> 24:59.277
something that had been given all the time. It's 
almost like it was expected and they would ask how

24:59.797 --> 25:09.495
they're going and but my oldest brothers by that 
time were married and gone. They were living in

25:10.176 --> 25:21.197
Houston and so at home it was only those of us that 
were still in school because every time one of the

25:10.176 --> 25:21.197
brothers was graduated, they would move out. My 
oldest sister lived in Bryan. She was married. And

25:29.445 --> 25:32.590
my other sister had moved to California. And my 
youngest sister, she worked here on campus, but

25:33.131 --> 25:40.162
later on finished her degree at A&M. So she was the 
only sister that finished Texas A&M. But they

25:42.986 --> 25:48.335
didn't tell you about, don't take this course or 
use... No, no. It was pretty much... You know, I

25:50.776 --> 26:00.411
guess we didn't talk much about what to expect or 
not expect because we pretty much knew that it was

25:50.776 --> 26:00.411
just get in there and do it. All right. What rules 
did you know were your rules of conduct and

26:01.132 --> 26:09.405
behavior as a college student because of your 
family? Well, I guess I always respected A&M. I

26:15.093 --> 26:18.218
respected the traditions. Those were just, I 
mean, I grew up not walking on the grass. I grew up

26:22.113 --> 26:23.494
not putting a cap on. I grew up, you know, singing 
the Aggie War Hymn, the Spirit of Aggieland. So all

26:29.481 --> 26:31.202
those things were just a part of me. To me, it was 
just like another extension of what it was to be a

26:31.723 --> 26:38.170
person, a human being, an American. And so in that 
way, it was quite unique. I think respecting my

26:45.350 --> 26:46.732
elders. I mean, all that was very much an 
expectation. We'd see some students who were

26:51.777 --> 27:05.673
perhaps on the fringe of the hippie, but really, 
but as hippies they got was that they had long hair,

26:51.777 --> 27:05.673
but it wasn't, I think, to the extreme that you 
would see in either campus across the state. All

27:05.773 --> 27:10.378
right, but then in your private life, what were the 
rules that you knew you were to follow? Well, I

27:11.253 --> 27:27.069
pretty much had to, this being my home and my 
parents being Christian, my parents, I never,

27:11.253 --> 27:27.069
this may sound strange, but drinking was never one 
of those things that I had ever aspired to. It was

27:27.269 --> 27:30.792
just not one of those things of smoking or doing 
drugs. It was just never one of those things that I

27:30.992 --> 27:36.558
never thought about doing in a serious way. And I 
guess what helped a lot was that the people I hung

27:40.261 --> 27:42.904
around with, neither did they. What about what 
hours of the night you were to be home? Well, my dad,

27:49.133 --> 27:52.757
once we were 18, pretty much it was really up to us. 
But during the day, during the week hours, we were

27:54.019 --> 28:02.490
working, so we'd get home about 10, 10.30, and we 
would maybe study a little while and eat and then go

27:54.019 --> 28:02.490
to bed and get up the next day. They would be... My 
dad, I hardly ever saw him except on Saturdays and

28:02.510 --> 28:09.880
Sundays because we were... He was in completely 
different schedules. So I didn't see him. He would

28:13.850 --> 28:15.453
get up early in the morning and go to work. And then I 
was working when he got back. And so my mom was the

28:17.897 --> 28:23.726
one who would give us breakfast and then leave us 
something to eat at night. But she was the one that

28:24.227 --> 28:25.850
we would always talk with. All right. That first 
fall, you said you went to Yale practice. Did you go

28:32.481 --> 28:36.407
to any silver taps? yes yes with the silver tabs um 
what was your impression at your first silver tabs

28:36.674 --> 29:06.057
i guess it was um pretty

28:36.674 --> 29:06.057
i guess i had never seen something like that i i 
related that to wow this is some solemn stuff that

28:36.674 --> 29:06.057
we do at church or something that you know what this 
is i guess what struck me was it was students who

28:36.674 --> 29:06.057
were who were engaged in this very solemn ritual

29:06.897 --> 29:36.533
that struck me regardless of what you were doing 30 
minutes before when it came everybody was quiet in

29:06.897 --> 29:36.533
a meditating kind of mood and I think that's what 
began to connect the dots for me about A&M and its

29:06.897 --> 29:36.533
traditions you go through the traditions and you 
see them and you hear them as a young kid But when you

29:37.205 --> 29:41.310
begin to see these things all sort of fall in line, 
they all make a lot of sense. Did you go to fish camp?

29:43.553 --> 29:43.733
No. I don't even know if they had fish camp in the 
19th. Yeah, they did. Because I used to go up there

29:48.359 --> 29:52.704
to speak about what land-grant education was. I 
was not one of them. Did you have anything to do with

29:54.647 --> 29:56.649
Bonfire? No, I didn't, because, like I said, I was 
working. Did you attend Bonfire? Oh, yes. In fact,

30:05.020 --> 30:06.081
my wife's My first date with my wife was at Aggie 
Bonfire. Was it that first year? No, no, no. It was

30:13.667 --> 30:14.408
in 1972. I was a senior. But I never could work at 
Bonfire because we were working those hours,

30:18.894 --> 30:25.122
which... Now, wait. I thought you said you 
began... When did you enroll at AM? 69. 69. Oh,

30:29.728 --> 30:30.910
okay. Yeah. All right. Well, let's jump forward to 
that. You mentioned that date. Describe that.

30:37.550 --> 30:39.014
that bonfire with that date? Oh, well, I was, I 
guess I was trying to impress her that I was a

30:39.295 --> 30:46.074
student and she was impressed, I guess. And we went 
to the bonfire and she had never been to anything

30:46.154 --> 30:50.446
like that. She was from up in Lubbock. And, um, She 
had gone to West Texas State University, so there

30:53.564 --> 30:58.732
was nothing like that at West Texas State. And this 
was a big deal. And I think for her, being in a place

31:01.976 --> 31:21.765
where there were mainly whites, all whites, and 
for us to participate in the school life and

31:01.976 --> 31:21.765
participate in what was going on was very 
different because that was not what she was

31:01.976 --> 31:21.765
accustomed to.
