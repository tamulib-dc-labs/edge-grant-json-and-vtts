WEBVTT

00:03.845 --> 00:05.787
It is Wednesday, October 9th. We are in the patio of 
Bob Cornish at 1214 Orris Street College Station.

00:15.799 --> 00:27.253
And I am interviewing Joseph McGraw today, who 
will tell us about the early days of the planning

00:15.799 --> 00:27.253
department at Texas A&M University. So, Joe, have 
at it. My earliest recollection of starting

00:32.882 --> 00:50.727
anything related to planning, not necessarily 
department, but just thinking about it as a

00:32.882 --> 00:50.727
subject, was in a phone call made to me by Ed Romnick 
in 1958.

00:51.989 --> 00:53.994
at Notre Dame, when I was teaching at Notre Dame. 
And he asked if I would come down to Texas A&M and

00:54.937 --> 01:00.271
start teaching. And in the course of that 
conversation, he mentioned that since Notre Dame

01:00.772 --> 01:08.833
didn't have a planning department then and I was 
only teaching fourth-year architecture, that

01:10.467 --> 01:21.042
perhaps this would offer an opportunity to expand 
my teaching responsibilities to include

01:10.467 --> 01:21.042
planning. And yet there was no planning program 
here, but we could begin to maybe work on that. Ed

01:26.088 --> 01:28.952
was only then a fifth-year teacher. I would teach 
the fourth year. He would continue to teach the

01:30.414 --> 01:34.260
fifth year under a fellow by the name of Nicky 
Holliman. Nicky Holliman was still dean. He was

01:36.421 --> 01:37.602
head of the department. It was called a division. 
It was an architecture division. I see. And so I

01:42.788 --> 01:43.549
said, OK. So Dean Benson, after some discussions 
with Dean Benson, formed an interdisciplinary

01:43.629 --> 01:52.198
committee. And that was the title of it. It was made 
up of people from civil engineering, sociology,

01:53.519 --> 02:00.707
the division of architecture, several other 
people. Do you remember any of the people? Yeah,

02:04.693 --> 02:06.395
Jack Keys was one. K-E-E-S? K-E-E-S-E. Skrabanek 
from Sociology was another. I was chairman of the

02:15.285 --> 02:19.110
committee. I can probably find out who the other 
ones are, but those come to mind. You had...

02:24.816 --> 02:29.161
Romnick was probably on it, too. You had somebody 
from Parks and Recreation? There was no Parks and

02:31.433 --> 02:33.295
Recreation Department then. Uh-huh. Now they 
have an entire building. Right. In fact, Parks and

02:38.720 --> 02:44.246
Recreation Department was started about a year or 
two after the Urban and Regional Planning Program

02:38.720 --> 02:44.246
started.

02:47.569 --> 02:50.932
I even helped recruit faculty for that 
department. Okay, well, then I came down here and

02:50.952 --> 02:58.960
in between 1958 and 1960,

02:59.497 --> 03:05.385
This committee developed a proposal for 
planning, which I'll give you a copy of. I've kept a

03:05.485 --> 03:08.109
copy of it. It was formatted by the inimitable Ed 
Romnick in orange and red colors. It's his

03:18.403 --> 03:22.669
favorite then and now.

03:23.172 --> 03:32.923
This program in 1958, probably would have 
constituted, if adopted in 1958, would have been

03:23.172 --> 03:32.923
one of the first 30 schools of planning in the 
United States. There were, I think, up to around 20

03:34.285 --> 03:39.030
maybe schools in the United States. It was 
presented to Earl Rutter and

03:39.050 --> 03:51.525
tabled by the Commission on Higher Education. In 
Austin. In Austin. That very same proposal, and

03:56.848 --> 04:03.339
then I left for the coast and went to work for . When 
it was stable, I figured, It wasn't going to go very

04:09.173 --> 04:13.698
far, and they weren't quite ready for planning 
here. In those days, I characterized the friends

04:14.880 --> 04:20.727
of the program called it socialism. The enemies of 
the program or the proposal called it communism.

04:25.612 --> 04:31.579
That was sort of the political climate in 1958, 59 
in Texas. So it wasn't, you know. It hasn't changed

04:33.341 --> 04:34.843
much, has it? I would not think so. I mean, it's 
still regarded, I think, with some suspicion.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.541
That needn't be typed. No, that's right. It's 
still regarded with some suspicion. But anyhow,

04:45.786 --> 05:00.004
then that very same proposal was reactivated on 
the last legislative day of the Commission on

04:45.786 --> 05:00.004
Higher Education, which has now become the 
Coordinating Board for of Texas. And with the

05:02.480 --> 05:12.830
astuteness of which he was quite capable of, Earl 
Rudder got that program approved on the last day of

05:02.480 --> 05:12.830
the legislative life of the old Commission on 
Higher Education. They didn't change one jot or

05:13.851 --> 05:16.974
tittle in the thing. I wasn't even on board at 
school and all of those things that were in the

05:17.114 --> 05:20.217
proposal. I then got another phone call from Ed 
Romnick. It seems like it's making full circle.

05:27.524 --> 05:38.598
Called me up at Wilsey Hammond Blair and asked me if 
I would come back and initiate and head up a program

05:27.524 --> 05:38.598
of urban planning at Texas A&M. The proposal had 
been approved. Do you remember what year that was?

05:41.521 --> 05:44.325
Yeah, that was 1965.

05:47.108 --> 05:51.053
And I said I would, you know. And we negotiated my 
pay, my rank. some promises about the program's

05:57.072 --> 06:02.781
autonomy later on, you know. It currently started 
out as a division within the architecture school

06:03.803 --> 06:16.583
with Ed Romanek as dean and completely supported 
by Earl Ruddick. And Holloman had retired by that

06:17.905 --> 06:19.688
time. Yeah, Holloman had become the associate 
dean of the college. No, he had not retired. He had

06:24.466 --> 06:30.052
become the associate dean of the college 
specializing in student affairs and things like

06:24.466 --> 06:30.052
that. He was an excellent man for keeping the 
records of the alumni and being an alumnus

06:30.072 --> 06:35.598
himself. He was very good at that job. Ed placed him 
well when he put him in that job. Ed had returned

06:40.784 --> 06:42.426
from Columbia to become the dean. Ed had returned 
from the West Coast to become the dean. head of the

06:47.917 --> 06:49.159
planning program. Wes Harper had come from 
Cordial, Rawlett & Scott to be head of the

06:49.780 --> 06:56.091
architecture department. Alan Staso had become 
head of a brand new department called

06:56.111 --> 07:00.899
Environmental Design. James Patterson headed up 
a research division. And Jim Marsh was the head of

07:09.922 --> 07:37.937
the department of building construction joe um 
you and uh wes and ed and maybe others for all i know

07:09.922 --> 07:37.937
uh knew each other before didn't you yeah this was a 
gathering of the clans yeah i was wes harper's

07:09.922 --> 07:37.937
roommate in college at oklahoma a m when we both 
went through architecture school and ed romnick

07:09.922 --> 07:37.937
was our fourth year professor in architecture he 
taught both the wes and And he was a Harvard

07:39.166 --> 07:42.691
graduate. He was instrumental, very 
instrumental in me going to Harvard and getting

07:42.771 --> 07:47.897
the master's degree in urban and regional 
planning. In fact, it was at his suggestion that I

07:48.238 --> 07:53.325
even took the planning degree. I didn't know 
whether he had lack of faith in me as an

07:53.345 --> 08:03.118
architecture student or whether he just saw this 
marvelous potential as an urban planner and

07:53.345 --> 08:03.118
suggested I go to Harvard and take that. And he was 
very instrumental in me going there and getting a

08:03.318 --> 08:07.283
scholarship and all that kind of stuff. where I met 
my mentor and major professor and then head of the

08:08.005 --> 08:17.282
Department of Urban Planning at Harvard, 
Reginald Isaacs. When the proposal was renewed

08:19.005 --> 08:31.347
and reestablished and the program approved for 
Texas A&M, Reg Isaacs was one of the first guys I

08:19.005 --> 08:31.347
called to come down He did this, by the way, at his 
own expense, because the planning program had no

08:31.816 --> 08:35.703
money, nothing. He came down at his own expense, 
and as a personal favor to myself, to further the

08:36.244 --> 08:43.197
cause of planning in the Southwest. And he came 
down, and they had a visit, and he met with all the

08:44.078 --> 08:52.373
faculty and the students of the college, and gave 
it. a good explanation of what urban planning

08:52.775 --> 09:03.709
would do and his hopes for it and how he thought it 
would affect the other programs and things like

08:52.775 --> 09:03.709
that in a positive way. And he solicited all their 
support. And I thought he was very helpful in

09:07.815 --> 09:12.000
getting that initial support by doing that. 
Probably needed someone with his reputation.

09:18.869 --> 09:20.031
Right. That was, let's see, what happened after 
that? I'm trying to think what happened after

09:23.535 --> 09:24.697
that. Oh,

09:24.957 --> 09:38.010
a new proposal was developed and put on board, and 
the... By the interdisciplinary committee? No,

09:38.311 --> 09:45.198
that interdisciplinary committee wasn't 
reactivated with, you know... Oh, it was, it died.

09:45.278 --> 09:48.381
It died, and...

09:50.993 --> 10:00.366
Myself and Romanek and others began to develop the 
first curriculum in planning.

10:01.287 --> 10:02.989
It was reviewed by Reg Isaacs. He reviewed it and 
made subsequent contributions and things like

10:03.029 --> 10:08.436
that.

10:13.003 --> 10:18.570
It was officially put on the books in about 19...

10:21.301 --> 10:22.262
66, I think. I'm not sure about that.

10:28.989 --> 10:31.812
The next step was, of course, was to get it 
accredited.

10:36.738 --> 10:43.085
We first started the steps towards accreditation 
at the St. Louis meeting of the AIP. And that must

10:43.105 --> 10:45.007
have been in 1966 or 67. I forget which. I know 
Walter Ruther was the keynote speaker of that

10:51.406 --> 10:58.605
thing, and it was there that I met

10:51.406 --> 10:58.605
Bob Williams and Israel Stolman. I often thought, 
looking back on it, that it was at that meeting in

10:59.267 --> 11:05.483
that convention hotel that our program was 
approved. Because based on just the verbal

11:08.090 --> 11:24.675
outline of the program and the

11:08.090 --> 11:24.675
success we were having with acquiring students 
and things like that, they really indicated a lot

11:08.090 --> 11:24.675
of enthusiasm for the program. Later on, Jim 
Gardner filled out and did the report on the actual

11:25.416 --> 11:35.571
documents for accreditation. Jim Gardner, when 
did he come on board? He came on board...

11:45.664 --> 11:50.510
I came on the 65, 66 year. He came on in the 67, 68 
year. Two years, I think. One-five. Two years. I

11:59.481 --> 12:01.744
could be mistaken. It could have been one year, but 
I have to look at it. I want this thing

12:06.181 --> 12:10.147
double-spaced so I can, it'll jog my memory and 
I'll write some stuff in, okay? Oh, yeah. Okay. And

12:12.249 --> 12:24.306
he prepared the report for accreditation, and it 
was accredited immediately after our first class

12:12.249 --> 12:24.306
graduated at the end of the two-year period, which 
is, was a record time given that the University of

12:24.640 --> 12:34.891
Texas had on board a planning program that, to my 
knowledge, was about 20 years old under Hugo

12:24.640 --> 12:34.891
Leipzig or Pertus.

12:38.475 --> 12:45.583
Hugo or the program were not widely supported by 
the administrative levels at the University of

12:38.475 --> 12:45.583
Texas like I was. And I think therein lies the 
difference in the programs. why ours was so

12:53.412 --> 12:59.942
rapidly accredited and Hugo's stayed in the 
doldrums for all those years, you see. We had

13:02.286 --> 13:09.097
top-down support for this program and enjoyed a 
very quick accreditation, I think, as a result.

13:10.238 --> 13:14.425
Our people at the National AIP and at ASPO knew we 
were serious about this. And the A&M program was

13:14.641 --> 13:21.832
accredited before the UT program, even though 
they had been in business much longer. Oh, yeah. It

13:22.553 --> 13:42.302
seems like the competitive quality of our program 
got the administrators and people off the dime at

13:22.553 --> 13:42.302
the University of Texas, and they began to support 
both the program and Hugo with more enthusiasm

13:22.553 --> 13:42.302
than they had shown in the past.

13:44.054 --> 13:49.601
Then the next person to be added to the planning 
faculty was Chuy Hinojosa, right?

13:52.725 --> 13:56.049
Actually, I hired one of our first students, Mike 
Harney. Mike Harney. Right. And he came on board.

14:01.356 --> 14:04.019
And then Jesus Hinojosa. And then Claude Davis, I 
think. Not sure about this. And then you. I'm not

14:10.588 --> 14:12.090
sure whether you came before. Was Claude here when 
you came? Or after? I got here in the fall of 1969,

14:15.088 --> 14:25.843
but taught in the architecture department for one 
year until a space was made on the faculty for me.

14:26.704 --> 14:33.073
There was no position authorized at that time, as I 
understood it. OK. Yeah, I guess that was it,

14:33.093 --> 14:36.157
wasn't it? Yeah. I remember I drove you free of 
charge back from San Francisco to College

14:36.297 --> 14:41.685
Station. only to benefit by my superb company. I 
know. Wonderful. That was it. But that was also a

14:47.701 --> 15:04.419
gathering of the clans, too, because Jim Gardner, 
Jesus Hinojosa, myself, and Bob Cornish all

14:47.701 --> 15:04.419
worked together in an outfit called Will Z. 
Hammond Blair in the Bay Area of San Francisco. And

15:05.681 --> 15:08.584
this constituted the primary faculty and who were 
largely hired, they may not believe this, but they

15:09.256 --> 15:22.371
were largely hired for their strengths and 
divergent points of view on the planning process.

15:22.891 --> 15:27.598
The only thing we held in common was that it should 
be at least comprehensive. But we soon depart

15:28.119 --> 15:32.105
company after that. And frankly, it was with the 
students in mind that diversity was brought on

15:32.265 --> 15:39.155
board. We felt that in my architecture training, I 
never had enough diversity. And I wasn't going to

15:44.323 --> 15:47.307
repeat that mistake in the planning program. But 
now we've all come to know which point of view is

15:48.349 --> 15:50.693
correct. It is correct. Of course, mine. That's 
how that started. And I knew these divergent point

15:56.421 --> 16:06.658
of views, having worked with these gentlemen, and 
that was exactly why that was the main thrust in

15:56.421 --> 16:06.658
hiring. In those days, there was no affirmative 
action or nothing. You just went out and got the

16:09.162 --> 16:11.506
people that agreed to work with you. And if they 
did, they were on board. And the program enjoyed an

16:15.352 --> 16:20.320
awful lot of dynamics and flexibility in that 
regard in its beginning. Another thing was that I

16:21.599 --> 16:40.030
don't think we saw the planning program here as 
one, another common thing we shared was that it

16:21.599 --> 16:40.030
must be comprehensive and it need not necessarily 
specialize in any given area of the planning

16:21.599 --> 16:40.030
process. Those were options that an individual 
student could do, but that was not necessarily

16:40.212 --> 16:47.483
going to be the general thrust of the program. It 
was not going to be transportation engineering or

16:47.503 --> 16:51.809
hospital planning or anything of the sort. It was 
general planning in its broadest meaning and

16:52.050 --> 16:57.618
interdisciplinary in its nature. And

16:59.281 --> 17:08.194
I guess also implicitly and explicitly by some of 
the faculty, we really thought we would have more

17:08.765 --> 17:13.709
influence than history proved that we had on the 
rest of the programs. We summed up one of the early

17:13.889 --> 17:23.618
graduates, Larry Priesmeier, who was a recent 
graduate in the architecture program and was

17:13.889 --> 17:23.618
recruited into the planning program. And in one 
conference in the recruitment process where he

17:24.418 --> 17:38.350
was hesitant to join, he said, well, will I have to 
give up architecture when I get my master's degree

17:24.418 --> 17:38.350
in planning? And what I said to him then, and I still 
believe in now, and I wish we were more effective in

17:39.106 --> 17:52.483
this, was I said, no, Larry, you'll just practice 
architecture differently as a result of having a

17:39.106 --> 17:52.483
plan to do it. And I had high hopes that our program 
would do that. It would influence the programs in

17:56.669 --> 18:03.257
engineering and architecture and landscape 
architecture to cope with the broader social,

18:03.625 --> 18:10.554
political, and economic factors that work in 
their work and make them more aware of the

18:03.625 --> 18:10.554
implications toward design. I'm not so sure a 
program was all that successful in that regard. It

18:14.999 --> 18:19.805
was a goal that was never really attained in my 
book. The planning faculty has attempted to work

18:19.825 --> 18:33.362
with the environmental design department, as 
you're painfully aware, particularly with the

18:19.825 --> 18:33.362
undergraduate programs, but also with other 
departments for graduate courses. in achieving

18:33.865 --> 19:00.362
this and it's been an uphill struggle for various 
reasons i think most of which have to do with the

18:33.865 --> 19:00.362
politics of the college yeah and i also laid at the 
doorstep of having graduated from harvard who

18:33.865 --> 19:00.362
ostensibly was in the same boat of 
interdisciplinary sharing and working with one

18:33.865 --> 19:00.362
another a la gropius methods and techniques It 
wasn't a practice anymore there, frankly, at the

19:00.342 --> 19:05.788
wellspring of all this thing that has been at Texas 
A&M. And I really think that the behavior that we

19:06.389 --> 19:15.999
expect out of our students in this 
interdisciplinary activity isn't modeled by the

19:06.389 --> 19:15.999
faculty. The faculty won't act 
interdisciplinary. So how can we expect students

19:20.824 --> 19:26.991
to see the benefit of that if the faculties won't 
even do it? Unilateral efforts have been made.

19:30.404 --> 19:38.633
Jose and I worked together for Henry Cisneros, the 
mayor of San Antonio, one of our graduates in

19:30.404 --> 19:38.633
planning, you see. Now on the Board of Regents. Now 
on the Board of Regents of Texas A&M. He and I,

19:44.280 --> 19:56.995
having separate classes, his in planning and mine 
in fourth-year design and environmental design,

19:44.280 --> 19:56.995
unilaterally worked out a common block of time 
where our students could work together. When that

19:58.477 --> 20:11.777
contract was renewed for the second semester, 
administrative blocks were thrown in the way of us

19:58.477 --> 20:11.777
duplicating that effort.

20:12.398 --> 20:13.439
When did that happen? Well, that happened last 
year. Yeah. And so there doesn't seem to be a

20:17.645 --> 20:23.834
predisposition to interdisciplinary... But 
that wasn't done by the planning department. Oh,

20:25.916 --> 20:26.517
no, no, no. The planning department was not at 
fault here. It was my own department head who is no

20:28.780 --> 20:33.407
longer a department head. He could not see his way 
clear to schedule my hours in such a way that they

20:33.427 --> 20:40.036
would match Chewy's. And so... Our students 
didn't participate in that rather successful

20:42.790 --> 20:50.056
project that Chewy did for the San Antonio area. 
But this is the thing. See, this is the thing. It's

20:54.060 --> 20:57.723
always kind of held back. The often used excuse 
that somehow the monies can't be allocated

20:57.743 --> 21:11.835
administratively to professors having joint 
appointments and that sort of thing is also just, I

20:57.743 --> 21:11.835
think, shibboleths and nonsense.

21:12.288 --> 21:15.631
There isn't the commitment to our rhetoric here. 
Makes a nice story, but really, the commitment's

21:17.894 --> 21:21.257
lacking. The will to work interdisciplinary 
isn't here, either, among a good many of the

21:21.277 --> 21:27.243
faculty. They want to do their own thing. Of 
course, if this continues for any length of time,

21:29.966 --> 21:33.830
it leads to a general malaise.

21:36.473 --> 21:41.738
Yeah, well, it'll lead to the individual there 
will be other programs throughout the United

21:42.511 --> 21:53.424
States that really take advantage of the strength 
that's to be gained from interdisciplinary

21:42.511 --> 21:53.424
behavior and interdisciplinary work. And we'll 
wonder why our programs are not as attractive as

21:53.444 --> 22:00.272
they used to be. Well, for example, there are joint 
degree programs that have blossomed in a few of the

22:00.292 --> 22:07.982
more heads-up institutions. You mentioned 
Harvard, and Harvard has a joint degree program

22:08.823 --> 22:12.467
with law and planning, and so does Berkeley. 
Right, right. And I went to a joint program. I did. I

22:18.555 --> 22:20.318
took all my economics at MIT. And they had a working 
relationship with a school down the road a piece.

22:26.649 --> 22:30.536
And you took whatever courses you wanted over at 
MIT. And then they, in turn, granted you the degree

22:30.636 --> 22:37.628
from one of the two schools, whichever you were 
resident in.

22:39.447 --> 22:41.550
Yeah, so I was used to the interdisciplinary 
thing. I was used to the thing. I come to it very

22:44.594 --> 22:47.197
naturally, and I thought it was natural for people 
to do this. The complexity of today's world almost

22:47.538 --> 22:54.187
demands that you have these kinds of approaches. 
But not yet, and not here.

23:00.956 --> 23:01.877
Yeah, I think... You know, in those time-honored 
questions they ask you when you're on your 100th

23:02.887 --> 23:10.042
birthday, would you do it all differently? And my 
answer to that is, no, I wouldn't do it any

23:10.062 --> 23:13.509
differently. All I wanted to ever do, you know, and 
what I did was make a difference. You know, the old

23:18.179 --> 23:22.127
time-honored Greek notion about that Athens was 
better for you having lived there. And I feel that

23:25.882 --> 23:38.818
with regard to our faculty and this program, that 
the state of Texas in planning and this university

23:25.882 --> 23:38.818
has been a little bit better for us having had this 
program here. And I have absolutely no regrets,

23:39.439 --> 23:50.072
implied or otherwise, about the serious and 
meaningful contributions this program has made

23:39.439 --> 23:50.072
as it's evolved over the years. And none of its 
graduates should, in my estimation, have any

23:50.812 --> 24:02.168
regrets regarding what they got here and what 
they've since done since they've left here. It has

24:02.189 --> 24:06.575
produced some stellar people doing very 
effective jobs. And we can all be proud of that.
