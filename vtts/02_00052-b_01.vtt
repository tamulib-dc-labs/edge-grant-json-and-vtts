WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:04.104
Outstanding everywhere I went.

00:04.424 --> 00:09.312
I mean, when I was introduced, we'd have these meetings in the town.

00:10.574 --> 00:18.067
When I was introduced in some little town out near El Paso someplace, there'd all be an Aggie there, and I'd hear the hoot, you know?

00:18.888 --> 00:22.214
And I always knew if Perot kicked me off the committee, I'd have a place to stay.

00:23.476 --> 00:28.384
And the other thing that I found, Haskell, was as I talked with these people,

00:29.225 --> 00:32.670
They all had favorite teachers, and all these teachers had nicknames.

00:33.771 --> 00:36.515
And one of the things I did, I collected these nicknames.

00:37.656 --> 00:38.838
I'll show you this list.

00:39.358 --> 00:40.860
I have a list of 86 of these.

00:41.081 --> 00:42.943
We want to preserve that.

00:42.963 --> 00:43.944
You want to preserve that.

00:44.966 --> 00:46.027
But think what it would be.

00:46.348 --> 00:47.870
Don't worry about it now.

00:47.990 --> 00:49.392
I got it right here.

00:51.655 --> 00:57.983
Think what it would be if we had all the anecdotes to explain how those nicknames came about.

00:59.448 --> 01:14.686
Well, I'll tell you, every former student could tell me... You recognize a lot of these, eh?

01:14.707 --> 01:15.367
Oh, yes.

01:15.668 --> 01:16.328
Oh, yes.

01:16.809 --> 01:18.551
Hey.

01:18.571 --> 01:22.536
Square Root, Jackson, and Alphabet Thompson, and...

01:23.242 --> 01:24.644
Whiskey Joe Gannon.

01:25.745 --> 01:27.086
I need a copy of those.

01:27.107 --> 01:27.427
Yeah.

01:28.688 --> 01:42.124
But the thing about it was, see, as a dean, I would be invited to go to these Aggie clubs and stuff, and I'd share with them these names, and immediately somebody in the group would get out.

01:42.324 --> 01:44.727
One night I was down in Beaumont,

01:44.707 --> 01:54.743
And these two old guys were really almost got in a fist fight over this, this guy, Count Zirko, who was, who would come into class.

01:55.965 --> 01:59.210
They were arguing whether one said he was Bulgarian, the other said he was Russian.

01:59.731 --> 02:03.897
And he would walk into class and take his cape off.

02:05.817 --> 02:09.661
and put it on the chair, right?

02:09.681 --> 02:11.744
And these guys would describe this.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.809
And they all had their favorite.

02:15.829 --> 02:20.394
There was a guy in English named Ingroff who, the second day of class, knew everybody's name.

02:21.195 --> 02:22.216
First and second name.

02:22.236 --> 02:24.258
200 students in the class.

02:24.358 --> 02:24.779
You knew that.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.442
Some guy named Stuart, Judge Stuart.

02:28.223 --> 02:33.529
And they all had, they can all tell you Judge Stuart's favorite story, see?

02:34.167 --> 02:47.957
And this was what the former students gave the institution its reputation in these towns, because they loved the place.

02:48.999 --> 02:51.585
So going into these towns, if you're from A&M,

02:52.747 --> 02:57.713
And they knew right off I wasn't Texan from my accent and everything.

03:00.417 --> 03:02.479
But I was from A&M.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.521
I wasn't an Aggie.

03:03.821 --> 03:05.543
They'd say to you, are you an Aggie?

03:05.783 --> 03:06.384
I'd say, no.

03:07.005 --> 03:07.786
Oh, it's too bad.

03:07.866 --> 03:10.009
That's too bad.

03:10.029 --> 03:13.613
But wonderful people.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.577
And they were all over the states.

03:17.182 --> 03:20.307
This helped me a lot, see.

03:20.707 --> 03:25.975
So you had locally, if you wanted to do something with that school or something, you had Aggies there.

03:27.497 --> 03:29.079
And this wasn't just in this country.

03:29.159 --> 03:39.915
I remember going to Guatemala City, meeting with 250 Aggies on Mustard Day, while we had machine guns and soldiers outside the hotel.

03:40.621 --> 03:46.889
And we have this muster and 200 and some Aggies show up singing the fight song.

03:48.031 --> 03:53.238
We were the only three people registered in the hotel there from A&M, all the other people.

03:53.518 --> 03:56.242
But the locals, Aggies, came out.

03:56.342 --> 04:01.910
So this is what the institution has that is so important.

04:03.352 --> 04:08.839
Here in Texas, as you made your rounds around the state, what were the other major players

04:08.988 --> 04:09.950
in education?

04:10.210 --> 04:17.044
What other schools were our cohorts in the major league?

04:17.184 --> 04:26.001
Well, the five others I mentioned, U of H, UT, Texas Tech, Baylor, and Trinity, we did a lot of work with, yeah.

04:25.981 --> 04:36.980
Trinity has a leader down there named John Moore, who's dean of their college, a very, very outstanding leader.

04:37.501 --> 04:45.255
And when we'd get in these battles with the state in terms of moving ahead, reforming things,

04:45.235 --> 04:49.002
We always had good support from these other institutions.

04:49.883 --> 04:57.036
And then, of course, we had good connections with Sam Houston and places like this, too.

04:57.076 --> 04:59.160
We developed collaborative programs

04:59.562 --> 05:04.628
With Lamar, we had a joint program in prepare educational administrators.

05:04.668 --> 05:14.240
Since they didn't offer doctorates, we felt it was an obligation of the land-grant university to work with them, so we developed a collaborative program.

05:14.901 --> 05:16.623
We offered some courses down there.

05:17.203 --> 05:25.253
We were the first institution to start that kind of collaboration before these institutions started their own doctorates.

05:25.273 --> 05:26.835
Who were our best partners in that?

05:27.271 --> 05:40.153
Our best partners would be probably, we had good association with the people at Houston, University of Houston College of Ed there.

05:40.193 --> 05:41.936
Bob Houselm was the dean there.

05:42.437 --> 05:49.889
Bob and I wrote a book together with George Dittemann called Educating a Profession, so we had known each other for years.

05:50.270 --> 05:52.013
We'd worked together back at Rochester.

05:52.887 --> 06:01.139
UT with Kenema, before the new guy came, we had real good relationships with UT.

06:04.924 --> 06:08.609
The new guy tended not to be very committed to education.

06:08.689 --> 06:11.653
He was more interested in dealing with the politicians.

06:13.656 --> 06:16.300
Texas Tech was a good collaboration.

06:16.360 --> 06:16.780
Baylor.

06:20.746 --> 06:21.527
We had

06:25.203 --> 06:28.534
good, good, uh, associations with Trinity.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.424
So we, we, uh.

06:31.906 --> 06:36.782
Right, and then in the school districts, in your experience, who were the best, uh,

06:37.218 --> 06:38.319
partners to work with?

06:38.339 --> 06:41.503
Well, we had people at Spring Branch.

06:44.427 --> 06:47.991
We had people in Waco.

06:48.211 --> 06:53.598
We had 12 superintendents that first started this research.

06:56.561 --> 06:57.443
What did we call it?

06:57.563 --> 07:01.167
It was a collaboration.

07:03.847 --> 07:08.835
We, you know, I don't know exactly the, well, they were all over the state, though.

07:08.855 --> 07:10.137
They weren't just around here.

07:10.257 --> 07:14.605
We had the institutions, Dallas School District worked with us.

07:16.628 --> 07:25.382
Of course, our two local institutions we've always had good collaboration with.

07:27.843 --> 07:30.906
or some school districts that, uh-uh, we don't want to?

07:30.926 --> 07:43.099
Only if that district itself was in trouble, and they were spending so much time on their own problems that, you know, they weren't interested in getting.

07:43.159 --> 07:49.545
But we never really had a whole lot of problem getting institutions to participate.

07:51.127 --> 07:55.251
In fact, our problem oftentimes is they all wanted to.

07:55.687 --> 07:59.706
And we couldn't respond to all of them.

08:01.171 --> 08:04.575
And this still remains a problem, you know.

08:04.796 --> 08:14.348
We're doing a lot of off-campus now work with cohorts where we get the district helps in some cases to provide the funding for the training of the faculty.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.771
And you can only handle so many cohorts, you know.

08:17.472 --> 08:29.608
So the problem hasn't been, even though we're out here in the kind of boondocks, we've always had, and we haven't had any problems getting school districts to work with us.

08:30.449 --> 08:31.652
And you served how many years?

08:32.734 --> 08:33.355
Nine years.

08:34.578 --> 08:34.959
From 89?

08:35.119 --> 08:35.641
Yeah.

08:35.721 --> 08:41.193
And I was a dean for 23 years.

08:41.874 --> 08:47.968
How did the changes in the president's office affect you as a dean?

08:50.480 --> 09:12.025
Each time, you had to spend time educating the new person on what the college was, what we were doing, and over the 23 years I served as dean, I had some real great ones, and then I had some average ones to work.

09:12.606 --> 09:16.150
I worked with 12 presidents and nine provosts in 23 years.

09:16.170 --> 09:18.613
So you worked with Samson, Vandiver, and Mobley.

09:19.977 --> 09:20.498
Yes.

09:20.959 --> 09:21.982
Is that right?

09:22.002 --> 09:22.082
Yep.

09:22.102 --> 09:25.470
And Mobley would have been president when you retired?

09:25.591 --> 09:25.911
Right.

09:26.974 --> 09:35.094
And then when I retired, I worked with him on some projects that he was interested in for about five or four years.

09:35.435 --> 09:36.838
Can you generalize about

09:37.358 --> 09:38.359
those three here?

09:39.260 --> 09:40.401
I would prefer not to.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.287
Let me say this about Mobley.

09:47.807 --> 09:55.855
I thought Mobley had the potential to be the best president of a land-grant university in the United States.

09:57.356 --> 10:07.365
I served on the search committee when he was named dean of business after Muse became, I guess, chancellor.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.609
And he was appointed by acclamation.

10:11.150 --> 10:12.392
We didn't need a search.

10:12.512 --> 10:13.633
Everybody in the college.

10:14.975 --> 10:22.665
Then he became president, and he ran into that situation with Cheryl on the football thing.

10:23.286 --> 10:26.209
We've lost two good, well, see, I had Vandiver, too.

10:26.930 --> 10:27.972
I work with Vandiver, too.

10:30.455 --> 10:36.002
We lost two great presidents over what should be a minor

10:36.910 --> 10:39.282
activity in an institution.

10:40.427 --> 10:41.774
Not through any fault of their own.

10:41.995 --> 10:45.452
As you know, you can get in trouble, not by what you do,

10:45.871 --> 10:56.164
But by what people who you delegate responsibility to, which you don't learn about until after it's too late.

10:57.065 --> 11:00.289
But Mobley had this international focus.

11:00.450 --> 11:05.256
He chaired the Higher Ed Coordinating Boards program in that area.

11:05.356 --> 11:09.381
He was developing this Asian connection and all of this.

11:10.407 --> 11:11.408
And he was a scholar.

11:11.689 --> 11:13.471
I mean, he was accepted as a scholar.

11:13.491 --> 11:15.574
And he had this terrific personality.

11:16.816 --> 11:18.739
And he ran into that.

11:19.300 --> 11:31.437
And I've often thought of this in my classes, this policy issues class, that in terms of the way you'd like to go down in flames,

11:31.417 --> 11:45.645
You might like to go down fighting over the core curriculum or something like that, but to have a situation where you've got this kind of activity happening,

11:46.047 --> 11:54.645
And then I think what happened was he never really had a chance to develop the full potential with the deans.

11:54.846 --> 11:59.917
He got tied up in the business of the capital campaign and all of that.

12:00.057 --> 12:05.288
And I thought he, in terms of the academic programs,

12:05.268 --> 12:13.498
And as you, I think you would believe this, institutions need programs of preeminence, right?

12:13.518 --> 12:19.846
And this institution had been relying a lot on engineering and ag, but I think it's much more than that now.

12:20.286 --> 12:21.187
And it has to be.

12:21.948 --> 12:28.095
And it has the potential to be, I mean, a world leader, really, of a lot of these things.

12:28.376 --> 12:30.358
And each of these people were so different.

12:30.558 --> 12:32.321
I enjoyed working with all of them.

12:32.341 --> 12:34.363
Vandiver, I loved Vandiver, too.

12:34.782 --> 12:35.744
He was different.

12:35.764 --> 12:38.428
He was totally different than anything this place had ever had.

12:38.488 --> 12:46.340
He'd write his books in the morning, and then he would meet with us at lunch, and we'd have some of the best discussions as deans over at his house.

12:47.622 --> 12:50.407
But they were on wonderful issues like world hunger.

12:51.568 --> 12:52.850
Let's talk about world hunger.

12:52.870 --> 12:53.572
What can we do?

12:53.632 --> 12:55.515
Let's have a world meeting here.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.077
Bring all the scholars in the world.

12:57.057 --> 13:05.154
But each of them had their own personality, and each provost.

13:05.796 --> 13:14.374
I felt that when we had McCandless and Phillips and Eaton as a team in that office,

13:14.354 --> 13:22.171
It was the best, best combination of, because as you know from working in that area, you need a team there.

13:22.953 --> 13:27.823
And here you had McCandless who had all the connections with the state and could handle all of the,

13:28.158 --> 13:32.965
the nuts and bolts stuff easily, you know, and he made it look easy.

13:33.626 --> 13:34.487
Probably wasn't.

13:34.788 --> 13:43.401
And then you had Phillips with his wonderful connections with the faculty and tremendous commitment to things like diversity.

13:43.881 --> 13:47.386
And then Eaton, who was a real scholar in his own right, you know.

13:48.428 --> 13:54.537
And with working with him, I can remember going into a meeting with Eaton

13:55.478 --> 14:03.131
And I always went loaded for bear with all the data I had, you know, and budget justifications and needs analysis and all this.

14:03.872 --> 14:13.008
And I had to send it over to him, and I was in a discussion with him about, you know, we'd have it at the beginning of each year around budget time.

14:13.849 --> 14:18.157
And he asked me this question.

14:18.197 --> 14:21.182
He said, where do you derive these objectives?

14:22.242 --> 14:23.226
You know, where did they come from?

14:23.246 --> 14:26.498
Are they yours or your faculty, the people in the state, you know?

14:27.542 --> 14:29.690
And I thought it was just a wonderful question.

14:30.312 --> 14:31.255
Just a wonderful question.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.062
Because I had prepared.

14:33.532 --> 14:37.738
If you prepare, you want somebody to ask you.

14:38.099 --> 14:44.508
One of the other provosts, whose name I won't mention, who followed, I went in and had this similar kind of discussion.

14:44.568 --> 14:55.084
After about the first 30 minutes, I looked, and I looked at these glazed eyes, and the question was, say, I have to come to your faculty Monday morning.

14:55.144 --> 14:59.691
Can you tell me two or three things I ought to say to them?

14:59.671 --> 15:13.516
He had, you know, and Hale was missing this wonderful opportunity to know about one of his colleges so that when he went to the next meeting with the board or something, he could be able to say, these are the things that are going on.

15:14.658 --> 15:16.321
And it wasn't anyone a great guy.

15:16.401 --> 15:24.075
They're all great guys, but it's competence, you know, and it varies from level to level.

15:25.135 --> 15:31.584
But here, I ran into some of the best leadership you can expect.

15:32.525 --> 15:39.816
Probably here and at Vermont, I had the best provost situation with this guy, Al Rawls.

15:39.936 --> 15:42.559
And I had one of the best presidents I ever had.

15:43.581 --> 15:47.707
Real interesting guy, former dean of medicine, who never read anything, he said.

15:48.047 --> 15:51.632
We used to have evaluations with each other.

15:52.473 --> 15:55.597
And at the last evaluation, he said, you know, Dean, I want to tell you this.

15:55.618 --> 15:58.802
He said, you know all the stuff you've been sending me before our meetings?

15:59.243 --> 16:00.144
I never read any of it.

16:00.264 --> 16:01.486
I give it to Al Rollins.

16:01.646 --> 16:03.990
Al Rollins, he loves to read this stuff.

16:04.010 --> 16:06.273
He reads it at night at his kitchen table, he said.

16:06.633 --> 16:16.067
But I'll tell you this, he said, you know, I can't think of anything you ever asked me for that we didn't do if we could.

16:16.127 --> 16:18.210
And he said, you know why?

16:18.190 --> 16:21.034
He said, you come in here all excited about what you want to do.

16:21.435 --> 16:21.855
And who am I?

16:21.955 --> 16:23.398
I don't know anything about what you do.

16:23.838 --> 16:30.628
He said, but since you're excited about it, I figured, well, we'll go along with it, right?

16:31.429 --> 16:33.853
And what he used to do was listen to everybody.

16:34.774 --> 16:36.737
He was a listener rather than a reader.

16:37.758 --> 16:43.406
And what he wanted you to do was disagree with him if you believed differently.

16:44.027 --> 16:45.970
And then he'd hear everybody out.

16:47.080 --> 16:52.828
and then make up his own mind, and then you could not change his mind no matter what you did.

16:53.309 --> 16:58.517
But you knew where he was coming from, and you knew what he was gonna do, and you could count on him to do it.

16:59.758 --> 17:00.740
He was a wonderful guy.

17:01.401 --> 17:05.687
Who were your key dean associates in those nine years?

17:05.707 --> 17:13.398
Fackler in science, Fallon in liberal arts, both very interested in education.

17:13.759 --> 17:16.783
Fallon ended up chairing the national committee

17:16.763 --> 17:20.409
as a representative of the liberal arts on teacher ed.

17:22.452 --> 17:29.844
Fackler had known people in the Office of Education, helped sponsor a conference the first year.

17:30.364 --> 17:35.132
The second year, he came here with people from the National Science Foundation.

17:35.312 --> 17:36.514
He was on the panels.

17:37.075 --> 17:41.522
He helped us get the Mass Science Scholar program going.

17:41.840 --> 17:46.746
They were the natural ones because that's where a lot of our students took their major.

17:47.867 --> 17:53.153
And Kunkel over in agriculture, outstanding guy.

17:53.894 --> 17:55.996
We had the best relationship with agriculture.

17:56.677 --> 18:05.367
And he's into an area of ethics and professionalism, not just in agriculture, but the whole area of professions.

18:05.347 --> 18:13.394
Stone in medicine, outstanding guy, just a real intellectual debater.

18:14.575 --> 18:21.302
And we used to have really good discussions at the dean's meetings, a lot of developmental discussion.

18:21.462 --> 18:22.743
It wasn't just nuts and bolts.

18:24.425 --> 18:31.571
Did you ever have any problem with outside interference from regents, politicians, former students?

18:31.631 --> 18:32.552
Legislators.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.371
Some examples?

18:35.391 --> 18:36.233
Yeah.

18:36.253 --> 18:42.551
We had, what was that guy's name that was the board secretary for all those years?

18:43.193 --> 18:44.175
Bob Sherry?

18:44.195 --> 18:44.877
Bob Sherry.

18:45.479 --> 18:46.963
Bob Sherry called us one time.

18:48.445 --> 18:55.857
We wanted to develop a program up in the base up there near Killeen.

18:57.520 --> 18:57.720
Fort Hood.

18:57.740 --> 18:58.281
Fort Hood.

18:58.742 --> 19:06.935
The general called us and wondered if we could offer some courses up there for some of the people.

19:09.059 --> 19:14.267
The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, what was his name?

19:16.424 --> 19:23.579
was good friends with the community, with the Central University up there.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.485
Central, I forgot the name.

19:26.505 --> 19:28.429
Central Texas College.

19:28.449 --> 19:32.357
Central Texas College didn't want us anywhere near Fort Hood.

19:33.097 --> 19:48.997
And Schleter learned that we were thinking about this and called Bob Sherry and said, you know, I think it'd be a good idea if you didn't go up there.

19:49.578 --> 19:54.784
And Sherry said, well, the general, who we're good friends with, being in the former military,

19:55.928 --> 19:57.150
I don't care about that."

19:57.350 --> 20:14.335
He said, and I want to remind, he reminded Bob Sherry about the time during the Ways and Means hearings, there was a president who was giving a report, and he recommended that the salary line in this president's budget for the president be cut.

20:16.899 --> 20:25.632
And so here we were between Schleter, the general, and we finally worked it out that

20:26.084 --> 20:33.400
that we would make arrangements for some of those people to take courses here.

20:33.902 --> 20:39.013
We didn't go up to Fort Hood.

20:39.297 --> 20:44.884
It ended up, though, that the president had to call the general and talk to him about this.

20:46.386 --> 20:48.329
But that's Texas politics.

20:48.349 --> 20:50.572
What about A&M board members?

20:50.672 --> 20:58.122
Never directly had a problem with that.

20:58.502 --> 21:01.947
Probably one of the most interesting problems we had was with Cheryl.

21:01.927 --> 21:11.697
Some of the board members wanted to give Cheryl a tenured faculty appointment, right?

21:13.138 --> 21:17.363
And Vandiver was caught in the middle there.

21:17.463 --> 21:20.306
Vandiver called Ponda.

21:20.326 --> 21:23.889
He didn't call me about this.

21:24.870 --> 21:28.614
And Ponda did what I thought was the right thing.

21:28.654 --> 21:29.335
He called me.

21:30.310 --> 21:34.258
He didn't want to try to answer this alone, which I thought was a good idea.

21:35.341 --> 21:45.362
And we both told the end of it that there was no way in hell we were gonna give Cheryl a tenured faculty appointment, and we would be saving him a lot of problems.

21:46.544 --> 21:47.266
In education?

21:47.747 --> 21:50.833
Yeah, in physical education department, yeah.

21:51.404 --> 21:53.567
And, you know, we had this unwritten rule here.

21:53.607 --> 22:03.683
We never hired anybody from athletics that we wanted to keep the two things separate because we didn't want to end up with all the old coaches ending up in phys ed.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.766
And phys ed was kinesiology.

22:06.066 --> 22:09.031
It wasn't athletics anyway.

22:09.371 --> 22:14.359
We didn't do a lot of preparing of coaches in health and physical education.

22:14.379 --> 22:15.741
We were doing research on

22:16.312 --> 22:18.696
performance and all of that stuff.

22:19.577 --> 22:27.890
And the image of our health and phys ed wasn't, we didn't want it to be sports and athletics and coaching.

22:29.853 --> 22:35.502
And we pointed out to him that the way the policy

22:35.667 --> 22:50.301
of how people get to be promoted and tenured is through the faculty process of peer review, and it would totally destroy any credibility we had with other faculty if we bypassed that process.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.788
And they backed off.

22:54.350 --> 22:56.374
Was Carl Landis still the department?

22:56.394 --> 22:57.415
No, Ponda was.

22:57.956 --> 22:58.798
Ponda was there.

22:59.198 --> 23:00.480
But Ponda handled this.

23:01.322 --> 23:06.290
See, I had tremendous department, tremendous leadership in the college.

23:06.310 --> 23:09.876
We really operated as a very close team.

23:10.784 --> 23:20.679
And we had, I did something, the 10th year of my deaning, I discovered a process that turned out to be the best thing I ever did as a dean.

23:21.601 --> 23:30.935
I would have a folder, and every department head would have a folder, and if we came up with something we wanted to talk to each other about, we'd put it in the folder.

23:30.955 --> 23:35.542
And I would schedule in at the beginning of the year a meeting with every department head every two weeks.

23:36.704 --> 23:37.365
Then with the

23:38.020 --> 23:48.191
development council meetings, we would meet as a team, but there would always be an opportunity individually to meet, and we had built it into our calendars before we did anything else.

23:48.972 --> 23:54.718
Sometime we didn't have anything in the folder, but we used to meet anyway, and that's when we got some of the best stuff done.

23:55.339 --> 24:03.607
So believing as a dean that you do your leadership through other people, not directly this process.

24:04.669 --> 24:07.892
And the department heads, I think, really appreciated that.

24:09.678 --> 24:17.493
Let's see, did any former student attempt to pull any strings?

24:17.513 --> 24:18.535
No former students.

24:18.615 --> 24:24.085
No one saying you got to take this student or that student into the programs.

24:24.165 --> 24:28.834
We had people would call every now and then, but we always stuck pretty much to the policy.

24:29.658 --> 24:33.104
Let's see, was the doctoral program already approved when you got here?

24:33.625 --> 24:33.925
Yes.

24:34.186 --> 24:36.209
So you didn't have to get any new programs?

24:36.650 --> 24:45.004
Well, we went through some new program specialties, and then we went through two NKs while I was dean.

24:45.806 --> 24:46.687
Any problems there?

24:47.068 --> 24:47.869
No problems.

24:48.980 --> 24:57.691
In fact, we won accolades for the most important of the standards in NCAT is the evaluation standard.

24:58.973 --> 25:07.043
And through Jim McNamara's approach, what he did, we used our classes to do survey research.

25:08.565 --> 25:14.412
He put the students on this process where we followed up a significant number of our graduates.

25:15.353 --> 25:18.497
And in the standard, you're not only supposed to follow up

25:18.477 --> 25:23.204
to find out your students' responses after they've been out in the field.

25:23.324 --> 25:36.705
But what we asked them was not only what they thought about the courses they took while they were here, but on the basis of the experience that they're having now, what should we be doing for new people?

25:37.208 --> 25:43.696
And then the other part of the evaluation is, what have you done to change your programs on the basis of the feedback you got?

25:44.017 --> 25:48.142
And we were able to demonstrate all levels of this.

25:50.805 --> 25:55.271
In that almost decade of deaning here, what were your major accomplishments?

25:55.431 --> 25:56.352
What are you most proud?

25:57.133 --> 26:00.077
Well, I'm proud of the

26:01.981 --> 26:06.145
the way the faculty worked together.

26:07.026 --> 26:13.953
I made a pitch to them when I first started.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.274
I'll give you copies of these.

26:17.216 --> 26:25.224
The first presentation I made to the faculty at our regional retreat and a couple others down the road, the anniversary things.

26:25.805 --> 26:31.971
But I always said to them, I thought if I'd like to be remembered in the time I was the dean that the college was

26:32.440 --> 26:35.164
innovative, rigorous, and caring.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.548
And I thought we accomplished all three.

26:38.609 --> 26:42.314
We raised issues of quality.

26:51.266 --> 26:59.798
In terms of the approach we used was to have periodic reviews and then to include everybody

27:01.043 --> 27:04.256
in our presentations, not just the dean's office staff.

27:04.296 --> 27:07.088
So when Vandiver would come over to meet with us,

27:08.063 --> 27:13.628
The people that would present would be the faculty and students in the programs.

27:14.309 --> 27:30.083
And so one of the things I'm most proud of is that we looked at the job of leadership as creating the conditions where you could fit the organization to the individuals.

27:31.624 --> 27:36.248
That what we tried to do was to do what we could do well.

27:36.228 --> 27:49.421
I think as I look at what we were able to do, we expanded the teacher ed program significantly.

27:49.461 --> 27:55.046
We ended up, see, with 2,000 undergraduates and about 1,000 graduate students.

27:55.386 --> 27:57.428
We developed the graduate programs as well.

27:58.810 --> 28:03.214
In order to develop the graduate programs, we needed to seek outside funding.

28:04.038 --> 28:13.029
And in those days, colleges of education weren't really receiving a whole lot of outside grants.

28:14.791 --> 28:30.149
But the way we went about doing that was through these inquiry areas that we had to identify areas that we had the talent and interest to move ahead on once we got the grant.

28:30.790 --> 28:32.712
And I think we began a pattern

28:33.080 --> 28:34.844
that today is really paying off.

28:35.666 --> 28:44.187
It started way back in those days where we started to look at inquiry as something that was part of the life of every faculty member and student.

28:45.213 --> 28:49.177
And today, the college has over $10 million in outside money.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.079
And it all started there.

28:51.740 --> 29:05.934
We created in the Associate Dean for Graduate Education's office an emphasis on research and funding and changed the patterns that had been established.

29:06.034 --> 29:14.342
When I first came, there wasn't much incentive to get grants because you actually carried out the same load that you had

29:14.322 --> 29:20.812
and the money was used for graduate students, and you didn't even keep the equipment.

29:21.293 --> 29:29.566
Today we give PIs some of the return, which gives them incentives to seek funding.

29:30.507 --> 29:39.621
But in those days, there hadn't been enough experience with this, and so we moved into changing the way

29:39.601 --> 29:41.905
We looked at outside funding.

29:42.646 --> 29:43.608
You didn't carry on.

29:43.768 --> 29:51.862
You know, if you got outside money, you were able to have some release time to work on that project, not carry the full load.

29:53.144 --> 29:57.291
And then we began to attract outstanding students in our graduate programs.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.396
And we had more options.

30:00.777 --> 30:04.663
I mean, we had more areas offering programs.

30:05.167 --> 30:21.355
I'm really proud of the minority, the success we had, and the way our faculty were committed to the values of the importance of doing this as an education issue, not an affirmative action issue.

30:21.556 --> 30:29.790
Do you remember any problems with faculty or student, minority faculty or students being accepted in the college?

30:31.272 --> 30:33.374
From the students.

30:35.396 --> 30:42.101
A lot of the students, as you know, in those days who came here had never had a black teacher.

30:44.003 --> 31:00.537
And so this black female African-American who teaches science ed is confronted with a white undergraduate who's her first black teacher she's ever had.

31:00.517 --> 31:03.021
in a university.

31:03.041 --> 31:04.724
She's coming to the university.

31:04.904 --> 31:15.922
And it was tough for some of our black faculty at the beginning because of the lack of experience of our white students with minority teachers.

31:18.125 --> 31:26.018
It never became a real crisis in terms of saying we
