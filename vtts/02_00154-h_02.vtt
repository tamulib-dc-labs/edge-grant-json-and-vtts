WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:09.383
On the second side, we're now departing Caldwell.

00:09.403 --> 00:26.730
A three or four page syllabus

00:09.403 --> 00:26.730
which tried to explain as

00:09.403 --> 00:26.730
clearly, simply, plainly as possible

00:09.403 --> 00:26.730
what the course covered.

00:34.051 --> 00:48.372
and how

00:34.051 --> 00:48.372
grades would be calculated.

00:48.392 --> 01:03.113
Never, never, never

00:48.392 --> 01:03.113
did I grade on a curve

00:48.392 --> 01:03.113
and always tried to persuade the group, but I hoped 
every one of them would make an A,

01:03.818 --> 01:28.847
but that my experience

01:03.818 --> 01:28.847
had led me to believe that the odds were 
comparatively small or comparatively high that

01:03.818 --> 01:28.847
such

01:31.865 --> 01:34.528
a circumstance would probably not occur.

01:40.174 --> 02:01.618
That explanation of grades included

01:40.174 --> 02:01.618
how the papers were graded, what each of the tests 
counted in terms of the semester grade, so that

01:40.174 --> 02:01.618
they would always be able to calculate

01:40.174 --> 02:01.618
how they were progressing during the semester.

02:13.922 --> 02:32.500
At first, I

02:13.922 --> 02:32.500
gave all essay tests, but as the sections got 
larger, we mixed

02:13.922 --> 02:32.500
essays and multiple choice questions.

02:35.922 --> 02:48.113
In those multiple choice questions, I always 
tried to select at least a few questions from every

02:35.922 --> 02:48.113
lecture.

02:56.440 --> 03:05.288
But an equal number from the text alone and about 
another third

03:08.744 --> 03:15.453
from text that were included in both text and 
lectures. Thus,

03:17.196 --> 03:36.642
in the opening lecture, I tried to emphasize to the 
students that if they hoped to make a high grade,

03:17.196 --> 03:36.642
they would need to be present each day

03:39.440 --> 03:49.054
take notes which they studied regularly, and also 
read their text regularly.

03:49.074 --> 04:07.422
I urged them to read the text before they came to 
class,

03:49.074 --> 04:07.422
following the listing in the syllabus of each 
lecture, each day's lecture topic, and the

03:49.074 --> 04:07.422
readings which related to that material. Thus, if 
they read the material in advance and either

04:13.949 --> 04:37.864
underline or highlighted what seemed to be the 
most important points, they would have a, quote,

04:13.949 --> 04:37.864
distilled version, quote, of the textual 
information before hearing the lecture. Then, if

04:39.194 --> 05:06.585
they took adequate notes during the lecture,

04:39.194 --> 05:06.585
I begged them to review those notes before they 
went to sleep on the same

04:39.194 --> 05:06.585
day of that

04:39.194 --> 05:06.585
class meeting.

05:09.839 --> 05:37.011
Finally,

05:09.839 --> 05:37.011
my counsel was that once a week, if they would 
review again their

05:09.839 --> 05:37.011
class notes and the text, the highlighted 
material in the text, they would begin to refine

05:09.839 --> 05:37.011
the material and file it away in their cranial 
computer.

05:46.861 --> 06:07.993
Then, when the test came, which were given about 
once a month,

05:46.861 --> 06:07.993
three tests

05:46.861 --> 06:07.993
plus the final,

05:46.861 --> 06:07.993
they would be able then to review the material 
which they had been learning gradually through

06:09.492 --> 06:19.603
the semester.

06:24.068 --> 06:38.284
In my opinion, the worst of all possible styles for 
handling the course for a student was to postpone

06:24.068 --> 06:38.284
everything and then try to bone up in the wee hours

06:39.783 --> 06:47.556
one or two nights before the test. That, to me, was 
particularly inadvisable for the

06:47.576 --> 06:55.910
final exam.

06:59.736 --> 07:00.217
Paragraph. For all of those years, I checked the 
roll every day in every section. trying to explain

07:08.200 --> 07:35.170
in the syllabus that whether they attended or not 
was their business and that there was no

07:08.200 --> 07:35.170
punishment for their being absent, but that if 
they were present for every class meeting

07:08.200 --> 07:35.170
with a maximum of two absences, then they could 
drop the low grade prior to the final exam. Thus,

07:36.314 --> 07:41.261
there was a reward for being present. And because 
of the number of students and the fact that there

07:41.281 --> 08:05.173
was no deduction for absences, I would not 
entertain

07:41.281 --> 08:05.173
material, I would not review their materials 
relating to, quote, excused absences.

08:07.094 --> 08:15.183
excuse absent, put that in quotation marks, dash, 
thus they were either present or absent. And for

08:15.223 --> 08:32.342
being present regularly, there was a return,

08:15.223 --> 08:32.342
there was a distinctive

08:15.223 --> 08:32.342
return on their investment of time.

08:35.782 --> 09:04.101
In delivering the lectures,

08:35.782 --> 09:04.101
while I had my lecture outlines up on the front of 
the lectern, I tended to move around a great deal in

08:35.782 --> 09:04.101
the front of the room,

08:35.782 --> 09:04.101
believing that that process would help to

09:07.220 --> 09:17.272
discourage sleepers,

09:07.220 --> 09:17.272
non-note takers,

09:07.220 --> 09:17.272
and other youngsters who were daydreaming.

09:21.516 --> 09:35.893
Sometimes there were attempts, sometimes I made 
attempts to tease

09:21.516 --> 09:35.893
a youngster who was obviously not listening to the 
lecture.

09:38.590 --> 09:55.870
or to feign

09:38.590 --> 09:55.870
deep discouragement

09:38.590 --> 09:55.870
over such a practice.

09:55.890 --> 10:07.483
On those occasions when I found a youngster 
asleep,

09:55.890 --> 10:07.483
back up, in that paragraph, in that first class 
meeting. I always told the students that if

10:09.592 --> 10:35.040
we found someone asleep, we would try to wake them 
up and then ask them to stand and give their name,

10:09.592 --> 10:35.040
hometown, high school name, and sing the high 
school fight song.

10:42.158 --> 10:55.793
On the comparatively few times in all of those 
years of teaching that someone did go to sleep.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.581
And I followed that routine. I always tried to be 
very sure to speak personally with that student

11:10.829 --> 11:25.747
immediately after class

11:10.829 --> 11:25.747
to assure them that there was no continuing anger 
on my part.

11:28.710 --> 11:39.823
In addition, I wanted to ensure that there was not 
some personal problem which was handicapping

11:28.710 --> 11:39.823
that student

11:43.600 --> 11:56.912
and which I should help to solve.

11:56.932 --> 12:13.607
At A&M, the students, particularly in the early 
years when the Corps members filled all the

11:56.932 --> 12:13.607
freshman classes,

11:56.932 --> 12:13.607
the students were accustomed the following 
directions.

12:20.688 --> 12:35.262
And they quickly

12:20.688 --> 12:35.262
followed the directions which I placed on them.

12:35.282 --> 12:40.067
Because of my own small town and working class 
experience,

12:43.827 --> 13:05.594
I was able to identify with

12:43.827 --> 13:05.594
these young men

12:43.827 --> 13:05.594
sooner than I realized at the time.

13:05.614 --> 13:12.282
Some of them were short of cash,

13:05.614 --> 13:12.282
but almost all of them were well supplied with 
dreams, ambition, and determination.

13:24.848 --> 13:39.130
Occasionally,

13:24.848 --> 13:39.130
there were a few pranks in class,

13:24.848 --> 13:39.130
like some fish trying to give a core sophomore a hot 
foot.

13:45.860 --> 13:56.055
are putting some well chewed gum in a late arrivers

13:45.860 --> 13:56.055
seat.

14:02.765 --> 14:15.664
Possibly someone tried to

14:02.765 --> 14:15.664
come to class on behalf of a friend, but I never was 
aware of any attempt

14:17.872 --> 14:24.001
at such a practice.

14:30.792 --> 14:40.487
I do remember one year when the students learned 
that I collected bricks from historic buildings

14:45.040 --> 15:03.045
Someone from the back of the room asked if I had 
anything from the Alamo and of course I responded

14:45.040 --> 15:03.045
by saying no and that surely no one would dare touch 
such a sacred spot.

15:07.250 --> 15:12.938
A few weeks later the first class session after the 
returned from spring break, a trio of smiling fish

15:13.508 --> 15:29.992
came up to the lectern after the others departed.

15:30.012 --> 15:42.570
They mentioned the question about the Alamo and 
smiled as

15:30.012 --> 15:42.570
one of their group

15:30.012 --> 15:42.570
placed a hunk of gray limestone

15:44.002 --> 16:09.712
placed a

15:44.002 --> 16:09.712
small bundle of, a small

15:44.002 --> 16:09.712
item wrapped in newspapers

15:44.002 --> 16:09.712
on the lector.

16:09.732 --> 16:10.633
As I opened it, It was obviously a piece of gray 
limestone.

16:17.930 --> 16:22.517
And I simply said you did. And they smiled and said, 
why not? We thought you'd enjoy it. When I asked

16:29.547 --> 16:30.308
them. What part of the building did they attack? 
They said the Southwest. Corner of the exterior.

16:40.244 --> 16:41.245
And a few months later. When I had. When I passed 
through. The Alamo City.

16:51.991 --> 16:53.813
I walked to that part of the. Mission wall. I 
noticed that the. There was.

17:05.829 --> 17:10.575
A

17:05.829 --> 17:10.575
dent. In the corner. of the building where 
apparently a piece of rock had been knocked loose

17:12.173 --> 17:28.472
recently.

17:28.492 --> 17:40.206
Paragraph, more interesting anecdote about A&M 
students involved

17:28.492 --> 17:40.206
some freshman in a 105 class.

17:47.272 --> 17:51.876
But I think I've already talked about that one. So I 
should not continue that.

18:10.051 --> 18:11.492
Now let's jump to Beginning the task with

18:12.097 --> 18:41.850
Dr. Calhoun,

18:12.097 --> 18:41.850
my next door office mate,

18:12.097 --> 18:41.850
who welcomed me with a broad smile,

18:12.097 --> 18:41.850
was Richard E. Winerdi, W-A-I-N-E-R-D-I.

18:44.193 --> 19:10.559
a marvelously talented

18:44.193 --> 19:10.559
petroleum engineer who had studied with Dr. 
Calhoun in New York and at Oklahoma and at

18:44.193 --> 19:10.559
Pennsylvania State University.

19:10.579 --> 19:14.183
I don't believe I have ever served with a more 
talented

19:16.897 --> 19:38.300
and broad and

19:16.897 --> 19:38.300
broadly, brightly inquisitive individual than 
Dick Quinerty.

19:38.320 --> 19:43.866
Some of my associates quickly told me that of their 
frustration with him at his sharp temperament and

19:44.977 --> 19:56.632
quick

19:44.977 --> 19:56.632
decision making. I never saw that side of his 
personality because with me, he was always

19:59.236 --> 20:13.414
tirelessly thoughtful, helpful, and 
considerate.

20:19.621 --> 20:47.890
Although engineering was his official field of 
study,

20:19.621 --> 20:47.890
he was well-read and

20:19.621 --> 20:47.890
curiously inquisitive in an almost limitless 
horizon

20:19.621 --> 20:47.890
of subjects.

20:51.329 --> 20:59.299
Paragraph, as we began our task, he was the 
associate vice president for academic affairs.

21:00.981 --> 21:12.654
I, the assistant, and Dr. Calhoun, the vice 
president.

21:12.675 --> 21:20.644
Winerdi and I attacked

21:12.675 --> 21:20.644
the total spectrum of work on the campus.

21:28.979 --> 21:41.012
And there was no clearly defined

21:28.979 --> 21:41.012
separation of responsibilities.

21:43.814 --> 21:51.002
Yet he primarily looked at science, engineering, 
and technology and I, social sciences,

21:51.893 --> 22:01.963
humanities, education, business, et cetera.

22:02.003 --> 22:20.702
Also, teaching anything related to instruction 
came to my desk first while research

22:02.003 --> 22:20.702
and service went to his.

22:27.213 --> 22:52.900
Paragraph, Dr. Calhoun always wanted to be 
well-informed about every topic

22:27.213 --> 22:52.900
of general interest, and so there were many, many 
conversations with him,

22:27.213 --> 22:52.900
both brief and extended.

22:57.031 --> 23:02.199
throughout the months, throughout the years.

23:02.219 --> 23:23.511
In some instances, that meant simply to pop into 
his office and mention a topic quickly or

23:02.219 --> 23:23.511
to engage in an extended discussion

23:26.765 --> 23:30.990
At the end of the day, following the departure of 
all of the other staff members.

23:42.065 --> 23:43.667
Before very before. Very long in the Calhoun.

23:50.376 --> 23:50.756
Years.

23:53.460 --> 23:54.561
There was a. separate research office that 
adjoined ours.

24:08.981 --> 24:22.860
And when my title changed to dean of faculties,

24:08.981 --> 24:22.860
all faculty matters of appointments, promotion, 
tenure and any problems relating to those matters

24:25.034 --> 24:33.863
became my responsibility. Paragraph.

24:38.367 --> 24:52.020
On the many occasions when Dr. Calhoun was on the 
road, be it Austin, Washington, or anywhere else,

24:38.367 --> 24:52.020
when Erdie and I would try to have all of his 
correspondence

24:55.072 --> 25:20.843
surveyed

24:55.072 --> 25:20.843
with the draft responses to every communication, 
typed and ready for his signature,

24:55.072 --> 25:20.843
waiting for him to return and review them, On the 
conference table on the long table in the

25:21.228 --> 25:33.067
conference room adjoining his office in the 
Teague building.

25:33.087 --> 25:35.611
Quite often. When dark Calhoun came back on the 
last flight.

25:43.143 --> 25:46.228
To Easterwood Airport in that. In the late 
evening. He would stop on the campus to review that

25:50.084 --> 25:54.649
material.

25:59.495 --> 26:01.417
And thankfully seldom. Found.

26:06.843 --> 26:09.066
Problem with our drafts.

26:11.569 --> 26:11.849
Thus. He could spend the next day looking forward. 
Instead of having to. spend time with his

26:21.083 --> 26:38.112
responses.

26:38.132 --> 26:47.327
One of the key introductions for me to the 
relationship of a nerdy and Calhoun came at the end

26:38.132 --> 26:47.327
of my first official day

26:50.412 --> 26:59.323
as a member of their squad.

26:59.343 --> 27:12.739
I walked with Dr. Winerdi into Dr. Calhoun's 
office, perhaps at 5.30 or so, and they began to

26:59.343 --> 27:12.739
discuss some key issue.

27:15.562 --> 27:17.044
Vice President Calhoun throughout his opinion,

27:18.290 --> 27:31.045
and as well as the manner in which he had reached a 
conclusion.

27:35.870 --> 27:47.824
My startled ear then heard Dick Winerdi say 
something like,

27:35.870 --> 27:47.824
quote, You don't know what you're talking about. 
That's a dumb idea. Why would you want to do

27:52.635 --> 27:54.739
something like that? Period quote.

28:01.090 --> 28:13.170
As a naive member of an administrative team, I was 
stunned that a subordinate would dare speak to his

28:01.090 --> 28:13.170
chief officer in that fashion. Quickly I learned, 
however, that John Calhoun proudly listened

28:15.412 --> 28:34.247
to an explanation from an individual that he knew 
was speaking to him honestly and sincerely.

28:42.682 --> 28:45.206
That same circumstance occurred to me. A similar 
circumstance occurred to me in about a month.

28:57.444 --> 29:08.020
When I went with Dr. Calhoun to a meeting of the 
library committee and typist, I think I've

28:57.444 --> 29:08.020
already shared that one. If not, leave a blank 
space and I will.

29:16.246 --> 29:43.772
Another place and time of Calhoun leadership, for 
examples of Calhoun leadership, was the

29:16.246 --> 29:43.772
gathering of the APC- the Academic Programs 
Committee,

29:16.246 --> 29:43.772
Academic Programs Council, which was in fact a 
gathering of the deans.

29:47.482 --> 29:49.925
Yours truly was added to that group. My first week.

29:55.472 --> 29:56.454
In the Teague building.

29:59.998 --> 30:04.985
It would include the Deans.

30:05.005 --> 30:05.365
Plus. Ed Cooper, who was the director of 
admissions and records. And would in later years.

30:18.346 --> 30:26.796
be titled also as a dean.

30:26.816 --> 30:41.493
That session, normally held at 1 30 on Monday 
afternoons,

30:26.816 --> 30:41.493
was the true academic staff session.

30:46.439 --> 30:47.020
Paragraph. Gathered around the table was a group 
which in hindsight, Dash,

30:48.029 --> 31:04.898
obviously it was outstanding.

31:04.918 --> 31:12.231
It included Fred Benson, the Dean of Engineering, 
a comparatively quiet, reserved man.

31:17.763 --> 31:21.175
But... Who...
