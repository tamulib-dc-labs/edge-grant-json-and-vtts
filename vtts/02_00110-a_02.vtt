WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:06.337
I don't remember exactly what I was saying.

00:06.377 --> 00:12.548
But anyway, you know, I was saying you put a cigarette butt on it, it would be back in your room before the thing went off.

00:12.568 --> 00:20.081
But in this case, you know, the guys that were chosen to actually do this from our class set that thing up, lit it, and it went everywhere.

00:21.003 --> 00:27.574
Well, the next day, our CO, our first sergeant,

00:28.904 --> 00:37.801
had got very upset with somebody else, thinking they had done it, but he eventually had called us all into his room, and really it was good.

00:37.841 --> 00:41.368
He had a gripe session where we were able to air out everything.

00:41.408 --> 00:44.954
Now the victim of this babble bomb was the CO?

00:44.974 --> 00:47.479
Yeah, no, I was trying to think whether it was our CO or our first sergeant.

00:47.499 --> 00:49.022
It must have been our first sergeant then.

00:49.205 --> 00:50.166
And you all were freshmen?

00:50.206 --> 00:51.347
We were sophomores.

00:51.367 --> 00:52.268
That was kind of unheard of.

00:52.288 --> 00:54.250
And this is inside the window?

00:54.270 --> 01:00.096
Yeah, we actually lifted the window up and set that bad old bomb on the radiator and shut the window back down.

01:00.116 --> 01:03.079
You got there by the fire escape?

01:03.119 --> 01:04.080
We were on the first floor.

01:04.580 --> 01:06.102
I'm sorry, we were on the first floor.

01:06.502 --> 01:10.486
You know, an interesting thing, our unit was split between dorm 14 and 17.

01:10.566 --> 01:13.489
I lived in both dorms the two years I was with that unit.

01:13.829 --> 01:15.751
And we were on the first floor of both of those dorms.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.473
So we had no, we had

01:17.875 --> 01:21.040
Who was assigned clean up duty?

01:22.302 --> 01:31.677
Uh, interestingly enough the freshman hadn't got to clean that up because he didn't realize we had done it until he got the freshman in there and cleaned it up and then he found out later we did it.

01:32.478 --> 01:33.900
That's when they had the gripe session.

01:33.940 --> 01:38.868
And we've had some, you know, some drown outs.

01:39.268 --> 01:45.418
When we were sophomores the freshmen were drowning out a lot of our, and what they would do is

01:45.871 --> 01:50.818
open the door and just throw a bucket of water in there and then take off running.

01:51.319 --> 01:54.483
And doors could not be locked is that right?

01:54.503 --> 01:55.605
Yeah you couldn't lock your door.

01:55.645 --> 02:12.368
Now there was a there was when you walked in there was a closet to either side and you used to be able to fix those doors to where the one door would hit against the doorknob one closet door hit against the doorknob the other one and so when somebody come in it would hit that door and stop they could open the door but it wouldn't

02:12.888 --> 02:15.350
It would make noise, they couldn't actually get in.

02:15.370 --> 02:18.914
You could do whatever you needed to do.

02:18.934 --> 02:21.316
If you were sleeping, you'd wake up.

02:21.336 --> 02:25.159
But you know, particularly as freshmen, they wouldn't let you do that.

02:25.239 --> 02:30.184
If you ever got caught doing that, they'd yell at you.

02:31.465 --> 02:32.266
Don't tell them what else.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.531
So at night, you weren't allowed to keep the doors like that.

02:40.734 --> 02:42.355
One interesting thing is that this

02:43.145 --> 03:12.747
uh the sophomores next door to me were drowned out one night and we heard it and we took off running and i went into every freshman's room and put my hand on his heart until i found one that whose heart was beating fast and we knew we we knew we found it and that stopped that stopped it because even though they never admitted to doing it we knew who had done it because of all right and when you were doing that you were what year i was that was sophomore sophomore yeah sophomore we were sophomores uh

03:13.030 --> 03:15.618
No, you were talking about drowned out, and it reminds me of one thing.

03:15.698 --> 03:27.512
We had a, we used to have some, I don't remember what we call them right now, Haskell, but it was, we, we,

03:27.948 --> 03:32.794
It's kind of like an all-out water fight out in the quadrangle there.

03:33.835 --> 03:47.552
And we had one one afternoon and I don't know, usually an upperclassman would say we're going to take this other outfit on and they'd get out there and you'd get buckets of water and throw them at each other and you'd have water balloons and people would get up on the roof and drop water balloons on people.

03:47.592 --> 03:50.215
It's almost like mini war out there.

03:51.116 --> 03:52.858
And we got in one

03:53.378 --> 03:54.299
out there one time.

03:54.379 --> 03:59.466
It was really a very, very big water fight.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.909
And it got into the dorms.

04:01.989 --> 04:05.974
I mean, there were people throwing buckets of water all over the dorm and all.

04:05.994 --> 04:19.110
And so, they, you know, they out came the, what they call those officers, tag officers, I think.

04:19.130 --> 04:20.652
They all came in to bust it up.

04:21.121 --> 04:29.592
And what they were doing is going down the hallway and seeing who was in the fight because you'd be in there with your clothes wet and everything.

04:29.652 --> 04:34.018
And they came in, and I happened to be in my closet.

04:34.038 --> 04:38.283
Well, when you open the door, it shut my closet door, and I just stayed in there.

04:38.303 --> 04:43.310
And Chris Anthem was in there, and he said, freshman, were you in that water fight?

04:43.730 --> 04:44.932
And he says, no, sir.

04:45.673 --> 04:48.917
And he said, well, then how'd all this water get in your room?

04:49.657 --> 04:52.980
And he said, I'm not sure, sir.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.682
I guess it came in from the hallway.

04:55.123 --> 04:59.207
He said, freshman, there is more water in this room than there is out in that hallway.

04:59.928 --> 05:02.731
He said, now I'm going to ask you one more time.

05:02.751 --> 05:04.072
Were you in that water fight?

05:04.112 --> 05:04.773
He says, yes, sir.

05:05.774 --> 05:06.975
And so he turns around and walks.

05:07.015 --> 05:17.025
Well, when he left, he took, you know, you had a door card on your door that had your name and your class and your hometown and your class schedule.

05:17.286 --> 05:18.567
Well, he took that.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.383
the cards on the door.

05:21.565 --> 05:23.768
Well, I walked out.

05:23.788 --> 05:24.870
He'd taken mine too.

05:25.871 --> 05:31.660
So, I mean, I'm sitting here trying to figure out how I'm going to set my defense up that I wasn't there, you know, and he didn't confront me.

05:32.521 --> 05:41.194
And, you know, they rammed everybody in that water fight eight hours on the bullring, which is two Saturday afternoons from 1 to 5 marching.

05:42.536 --> 05:46.782
And my cousin that I mentioned to you earlier happened to be

05:48.128 --> 05:54.077
not the officer of the day, but the junior on guard duty that night.

05:55.038 --> 05:58.724
And he was given that stack of cards and told to ram everybody eight hours.

05:58.804 --> 06:01.909
And he came to my car, Chris's car, and he set them aside.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.033
And he gave them back to me and told me I owed him big time.

06:05.114 --> 06:13.787
But we did not have to walk the bullring because I haven't had a cousin at the right place at the right time, I guess.

06:14.247 --> 06:16.110
Describe walking the bullring.

06:16.597 --> 06:18.199
Well I never had to walk it fortunately.

06:18.279 --> 06:30.273
You could be rammed hours directly and so I mean if a fence was serious enough they could ram you two hours on the bullring.

06:30.293 --> 06:34.518
Otherwise you got like what they just called rams, demerits I guess.

06:35.279 --> 06:39.945
And a freshman was allowed a certain number of those and it seemed like it was about thirty.

06:40.245 --> 06:44.410
And then every time you got maybe two

06:44.575 --> 06:47.478
some amount over 30 minute an hour on the bullring.

06:47.558 --> 06:49.240
I never got over my limit any time.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.242
Sophomore was allowed 20 or 25.

06:51.262 --> 06:55.587
Well, what did happen on the bullring?

06:55.867 --> 07:05.978
Okay, they would take them out and march them, I think for about 45 or 50 minutes and then you get a 10 minute break and then they go out and march again.

07:06.038 --> 07:08.101
But you were in just close order formation.

07:08.141 --> 07:09.682
And this is where?

07:09.863 --> 07:10.603
Was there a place?

07:10.743 --> 07:11.224
Yeah.

07:11.457 --> 07:18.203
And I'm not sure I remember where they, it seemed like they used to do it over by Duncan Field area.

07:19.284 --> 07:29.473
But they would take you out there and you would just be right face, left face and I think you had to, seemed like you may have had to march with a rifle too.

07:29.773 --> 07:40.823
But four hours of that on a hot sunny afternoon, I mean I saw some of my friends after they walked four hours in there and I was always thankful I never had to walk it.

07:41.562 --> 07:48.190
Describe the difference of being a sophomore compared to being a freshman.

07:48.931 --> 07:56.941
Well, you know, it's kind of interesting in some outfits that where they were kind of easy on their freshmen, they were kind of hard on their sophomores.

07:57.462 --> 08:01.327
Sophomore life in all it was cranked up to be either.

08:01.367 --> 08:09.477
My particular unit was extremely hard on the freshmen, but we had a much easier sophomore year.

08:09.912 --> 08:13.555
You know, they held you accountable for having the freshman in line.

08:15.857 --> 08:20.241
But, I always think, I mean, there's a black belt and a white belt, you know.

08:20.261 --> 08:26.166
Freshmen and sophomores wear black belts and juniors and seniors wear white.

08:27.027 --> 08:30.971
And that's the real break to me was when you became a junior that you were.

08:30.991 --> 08:35.275
And I don't think it's just because I got married and moved off campus and had a day student outfit.

08:36.155 --> 08:38.097
But, I mean,

08:38.397 --> 08:40.079
There was a status change there.

08:40.640 --> 08:45.146
The sophomores were just a little better freshman, I think.

08:46.247 --> 08:50.633
You know, your academics, you know, they'd push you on academics.

08:50.713 --> 09:02.228
They stressed academics back then, but I think they knew how to, because you weren't doing, you know, some of my friends didn't have good grades, so then they would punish them by making them go out and run,

09:03.929 --> 09:08.654
do a physical exercise, well then they'd come in so tired they'd fall asleep trying to study.

09:09.075 --> 09:12.258
So I don't think they ever quite got that together back then.

09:12.899 --> 09:21.368
I'll tell you, good students then, though, got off better than, I mean, if a kid had bad grades, they were on them a lot.

09:21.388 --> 09:32.721
The kids that had good grades, for the most part, even if they were a little klutzy and everything else, there was a little different, I think their treatment was better as a rule, but sophomore was,

09:33.528 --> 09:44.362
You know, you got to wear your hat inside buildings and it was more the, you know, you were no longer a fish, you didn't have to say sir.

09:45.604 --> 10:00.744
And I always thought being a sophomore all of a sudden was kind of a good chance to do the things that I thought sophomores should have done and not do some of the things that I thought were bad.

10:00.764 --> 10:02.927
And I think some kids

10:03.211 --> 10:13.868
took that as an opportunity, well that happened to me, I'm gonna pass it, I'm gonna do the same thing instead of realizing that that didn't make a lot of sense and it wasn't helpful.

10:14.930 --> 10:23.103
I never minded some of the discipline and the push-ups and things like that because I think it toughened me.

10:24.065 --> 10:27.110
I've always said A&M isn't effort for everyone, but it was good for me.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.674
I grew up a lot.

10:29.992 --> 10:34.860
It prepared me for a lot of things which we'll get into when you want to.

10:35.020 --> 10:40.929
The sophomore year to me was a little bit more fun because you knew the ropes.

10:40.949 --> 10:46.057
Like I was telling you that fish day where you knew you could get away with things.

10:46.738 --> 10:52.467
I think we did more pranks and did more fun stuff as sophomores than we did as freshmen.

10:52.968 --> 10:56.674
Freshmen at times you're almost too afraid to do some of those things.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.830
Those sophomore pranks were played on who?

11:00.030 --> 11:01.131
Sometimes even each other.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.355
Not always junior or senior?

11:04.375 --> 11:06.176
No, but we do that too sometimes.

11:06.517 --> 11:14.105
As you look back, do you think of any that were bad taste, bad judgment?

11:15.646 --> 11:17.148
And pranks?

11:20.651 --> 11:23.514
I can't remember any we did that were really bad.

11:24.535 --> 11:26.357
We got into

11:27.063 --> 11:37.857
We got into where a group of us were kind of drowning each other out, which just sounds kind of stupid, but that probably was something that shouldn't have happened.

11:37.877 --> 11:44.144
But I haven't heard you talk about anything that was physically harmful to another person.

11:44.685 --> 11:45.807
Not that I did.

11:45.827 --> 11:46.487
Or degrading.

11:46.608 --> 11:46.908
No.

11:47.849 --> 11:54.537
That it was... I think there were some freshmen that experienced some of that when I was here.

11:54.557 --> 11:56.580
I told you about the one guy that was...

11:57.067 --> 12:06.215
You know, going around in circles and being, you know, certainly there's nothing morally wrong with that or any of those type of serious things.

12:06.255 --> 12:12.961
I just think it was, I mean, if you want to, you know, do something, there's no reason to be down there tripping them.

12:13.681 --> 12:18.225
Before, in case we don't get into this, I want to tell you about one thing we did as freshmen.

12:18.385 --> 12:22.809
We had a, we always put up those spirit signs, I call them.

12:22.829 --> 12:26.112
And these are, you know, the signs before football games.

12:26.733 --> 12:30.457
that say you're going to be whoever you're about to play.

12:31.358 --> 12:46.974
And it's funny, I remember there was a song popular then about Froggy Went A Courtin' and one of the signs somebody put up was Froggy Went A Courtin' and he did ride till old army tanned his hide.

12:47.775 --> 12:50.698
And we were of course about to play TCU.

12:51.939 --> 12:55.423
Well we were about to play SMU and my group

12:56.112 --> 12:59.675
got a little carried away with their sign, and it was not in good taste.

13:01.737 --> 13:08.564
And certainly not something I'd be proud to have my name associated with.

13:08.864 --> 13:14.269
And you used to get together and do these on these sheets and all.

13:14.289 --> 13:17.012
This particular sign, fortunately, I didn't have anything to do with.

13:17.532 --> 13:25.900
But when it went up, I must admit, I was somewhat embarrassed about the sign, about what we were going to do to SMU and all.

13:26.470 --> 13:40.392
Well, somebody censored this sign and so it had to be changed and so it was changed and stuck back up there with like a sew over deal.

13:40.413 --> 13:46.602
And then the next day it was missing and all of our upper classmen, particularly our juniors, were furious.

13:47.604 --> 13:52.512
So, we're in formation for chow and we were told as freshmen

13:53.386 --> 13:59.995
that there better not be a sign hanging in that quadrangle tomorrow morning.

14:00.015 --> 14:00.415
Period.

14:00.876 --> 14:11.170
Or there weren't going to be any freshmen that, you know, would, you know, who could, you know, we were going to be doing so many push-ups that we'd die kind of thing.

14:11.190 --> 14:12.451
Not die, but I mean, you know.

14:13.613 --> 14:17.638
So, we got together, and this is real cloak and dagger stuff.

14:17.738 --> 14:22.144
We went out and we got charged and we made mild cough cocktails.

14:23.575 --> 14:31.086
And we organized this, there were about four signs and we put like four teams together.

14:32.148 --> 14:43.645
And we sent this one team off to the further sign and when their sign went up in flames, all we did was throw them up against those brick walls and they broke the jar and the signs burned down.

14:44.146 --> 14:50.055
Sounds more dangerous than it was, not saying it's not a little danger to it, but it really wasn't a danger of the property or anything.

14:51.115 --> 15:02.873
And as soon as that one went off, the next brother's group, they would start running back, the next group would do theirs and all, until my group was doing the sign that was hanging on our dorm, and we'd throw it, and we'd all go in and hit the bed and go to bed.

15:04.035 --> 15:11.386
Well, we waited, and we waited, and we waited, and we... The first group sign never did go up, or didn't go up for a long time.

15:11.466 --> 15:12.307
Finally, it went up.

15:12.428 --> 15:17.916
Well, when it did, the other groups got nervous, and they all threw theirs up at one time, and all our planning kind of went to pot.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.375
All these signs are blazing.

15:20.435 --> 15:21.636
We run back in the dorms.

15:21.656 --> 15:23.218
We get in our rooms, and we look out.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.681
And I asked this guy that was in the first group.

15:25.701 --> 15:27.103
I said, what in the world happened to you?

15:27.123 --> 15:29.787
He said, well, the KK stopped us, the campus cops.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.008
They said, what are you all doing?

15:31.028 --> 15:32.270
Well, we're out burning signs.

15:32.310 --> 15:33.852
I mean, they ended up fessing up.

15:33.872 --> 15:35.915
And the guy ends up saying, well, be careful.

15:36.395 --> 15:44.005
Well, while those signs were burning, his car was parked down at the end of the quadrangle until all the flyers went out, and then he drove off.

15:44.609 --> 15:50.097
And I thought, boy, it's kind of interesting that he let that, you know, he knew what was happening and he let it happen.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.519
But, of course, they're scared of death.

15:51.539 --> 15:52.781
They were trying to hide from him.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.924
He's trying to figure out what's going on, chase them down.

15:54.944 --> 15:57.167
He finally finds them.

15:57.187 --> 15:59.971
And when he found out what they were doing, he said, well, y'all be careful.

16:00.552 --> 16:03.456
And they told him, our upperclassmen told us we had to do these signs.

16:03.476 --> 16:05.359
So he tolerated that.

16:05.459 --> 16:08.484
But that was our big cloak and dagger story as freshmen.

16:08.504 --> 16:12.029
All right, let's talk about academics now.

16:12.069 --> 16:14.312
What was the routine?

16:15.794 --> 16:22.444
of going to class, when, where, how often, what did you do in class, how did you prepare for class?

16:22.644 --> 16:30.656
Well, we had CQ every night from I think 7 to 10, if I recall correctly, or 10.30 maybe, somewhere in that range.

16:31.938 --> 16:38.527
I think it was 10.30 and you had to be in your room, excuse me, sitting at your desk studying.

16:38.608 --> 16:39.589
That's how you prepared.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.675
Obviously there were times during the day you could study,

16:44.515 --> 16:46.017
go to the library and study.

16:46.157 --> 16:46.918
Some kids did a lot.

16:46.938 --> 16:53.084
The library was kind of a safe haven as Cushing then, which you know they're restoring.

16:53.104 --> 17:08.601
But we, you know, your class schedule was whatever you could get and back then you had to go stand in line to register and it seemed like we did all that at Sevisa Hall if I remember correctly.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.303
And you had to

17:10.587 --> 17:15.795
You know, a freshman kind of low end of the pole, you know, seniors would register first and then pass on down.

17:15.815 --> 17:26.771
I mean, often you were struggling to get in your classes you needed and you would, so your schedule was just whatever you could.

17:26.791 --> 17:28.113
What did you take to class?

17:28.774 --> 17:40.071
When I take to class, I took a book, I took whatever the classroom or the, you know, the book for that course was and I took a

17:41.553 --> 17:52.368
clipboard with paper and maybe even had a spiral notebook in it, but I had a clipboard, I know that, and a pen and pencil.

17:52.388 --> 17:55.572
Of course you knew all the engineers because they had slide rules hanging from their belt.

17:57.795 --> 18:04.484
And that, you know, they were still using slide rules big time and everybody had to have one that was an engineering major.

18:04.685 --> 18:10.092
There were other majors, I'm sure, too, but that was, we used to talk to our

18:11.067 --> 18:13.109
relate to the engineers with us liberals.

18:13.930 --> 18:18.335
And, you know, if you had three classes in a row, you'd just carry three books with you.

18:18.676 --> 18:27.826
The classes were, I believe, 50 minutes, you know, and they'd start on the hour and end at like 10 till the hour, and then you had 10 minutes to get to your next class.

18:27.846 --> 18:32.492
How regularly did you and your classmates attend class?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.553
Well, it varied.

18:34.034 --> 18:35.736
I didn't cut class.

18:37.077 --> 18:37.918
Was the role checked?

18:38.371 --> 18:43.218
Some classes it was, some classes it wasn't.

18:43.238 --> 18:45.060
I just don't remember cutting class.

18:45.181 --> 18:51.910
I cut class a couple of times to study for a major test for another class that I hadn't quite got together.

18:52.030 --> 19:00.322
I mean, there's times I remember studying in the middle of the night and waking up, you know, with my head on my desk in the morning.

19:01.243 --> 19:05.509
And so, I cut a class to study for that course.

19:05.995 --> 19:31.260
I remember one time sneaking out of a class early, it was kind of funny, the seat by the door, the professor used to spend, I don't remember who this was, but he used to spend a lot of time, he was in the business school when I was majoring in the, I was an accounting major and I was in some business course, it wasn't an accounting course, but he would talk to the class and look out the window, you know, he'd sit there and talk and

19:31.966 --> 19:43.217
and talk out of the textbook, which some would have a tendency to do, and so the guy sitting by the door, he sneaks out, and then there's just a movement of people toward that seat.

19:43.237 --> 19:47.201
It just gravitates, and I normally didn't get involved in that one day.

19:47.281 --> 19:54.168
I needed to get back and study, or I don't even remember for sure, but I just know I didn't cut classroom.

19:55.610 --> 19:58.092
Anytime I cut class, there was a reason I'm not

19:58.510 --> 20:00.713
I guess that's just the way I was raised.

20:00.793 --> 20:03.036
It was always hard for me to do that.

20:03.056 --> 20:05.219
But I got in the rotation of moving one chair.

20:05.419 --> 20:14.652
Every time he'd look out the window, you'd move the chair until half the class would be gone by the time the class was over.

20:14.672 --> 20:18.217
Were there some legendary nicknames?

20:19.098 --> 20:20.760
Yeah, and I don't know if I can remember those.

20:22.483 --> 20:27.049
The judge was a guy who taught business law.

20:27.805 --> 20:29.488
And he really wasn't a judge.

20:30.990 --> 20:35.057
Stewart, he had some great stories.

20:35.117 --> 20:38.282
I don't know if you got into any of that or if you know who I'm talking about.

20:38.302 --> 20:39.825
I know who you're talking about.

20:39.845 --> 20:43.911
Yeah, but he had, you know, he had some great stories.

20:43.931 --> 20:46.716
He's a great, great B-Law prop, I thought.

20:46.936 --> 20:48.078
I mean, I really learned a lot.

20:48.098 --> 20:49.480
I look forward to his classes.

20:50.602 --> 20:53.627
Very good lecturer.

20:54.063 --> 21:04.579
He used to always have case studies to talk to you about, and he had an incredible way of describing these stories.

21:04.599 --> 21:12.311
He may have been a lawyer, I would assume he was the way he would use the vocabulary and all that.

21:12.952 --> 21:19.041
You almost hear him up in front of the judge sometimes talking, but they called him the judge.

21:20.725 --> 21:30.857
You know, I was trying to think, Walter Manning, who's still alive and lives in the community here, was a accounting prof of mine, but I don't remember him having a nickname.

21:30.877 --> 21:46.014
You know, all those nicknames, there were some great nicknames, but a lot of them were in chemistry and, you know, one guy was called, seemed like Great Point, Great Point something or the other.

21:46.034 --> 21:47.215
Dr. Dan, the Great Point Man?

21:47.235 --> 21:50.479
Yeah, yeah, Dr. Dan, the Great Point Man.

21:50.932 --> 21:55.481
What about English or history or political science?

21:56.604 --> 21:57.325
Math?

21:57.345 --> 22:02.215
Yeah, I know there were nicknames, and I just can't remember any of those.

22:02.436 --> 22:10.071
I wish I could tell you, and maybe some of them will come back to me, but I didn't have a lot of those profs that had nicknames.

22:10.091 --> 22:11.995
You know, Judge Stewart's only one I had.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.862
And I thought for a long time he was a judge.

22:15.003 --> 22:18.306
I found out after I'd been out of school a long time that he wasn't really a judge.

22:18.326 --> 22:21.109
How large were the classes in numbers of students?

22:22.411 --> 22:28.578
It varied, but you know, I remember most of my classes probably being in the 20s.

22:30.880 --> 22:36.807
You could get into some kind of a lecture class that might have 70, 80, 100 people in it.

22:37.607 --> 22:41.712
And some things like I took

22:42.704 --> 22:50.516
and there'd be a lecture class, there'd be a lot, and then you'd break into lab sessions.

22:50.536 --> 22:56.284
You know, you had those lecture lab combinations, and those classes would be large, but they're not large compared to what they do now.

22:56.545 --> 23:00.831
All right, now describe the campus physically in your day.

23:00.851 --> 23:02.293
What were the key buildings?

23:02.394 --> 23:05.739
Well, the academic building, I always thought it was kind of the center of the campus.

23:07.081 --> 23:10.686
And, you know, the MSC, Cushing Library,

23:11.645 --> 23:16.750
Uh, Guyon Hall was here then.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.812
Uh, I'm trying to think when they tore Guyon Hall down.

23:18.872 --> 23:21.915
They tore it down when I was here, or right after I was 66 maybe.

23:23.076 --> 23:24.517
Yeah, a little after I left.

23:25.358 --> 23:33.026
And, uh, the President Rutter's home that burned was here over not too far from my dorm area.

23:33.226 --> 23:37.049
It burned, if I'm not mistaken, during the Christmas holidays.

23:37.850 --> 23:38.631
And, uh,

23:39.218 --> 23:41.742
and they built the new home and they used the bricks.

23:42.123 --> 23:45.187
Brick from that home came from some building they tore down.

23:46.209 --> 23:47.010
I remember that.

23:47.030 --> 23:48.452
I think Old Sonets Hall.

23:48.472 --> 23:53.540
Yeah, the chancellor I think lived on campus near Sevisa Hall at that time.

23:54.041 --> 23:58.047
The post office, that's a big one that was, you know, there at Northgate.

23:59.650 --> 24:02.494
The dorms, there were basically two dormitory areas.

24:02.514 --> 24:04.838
You had

24:05.678 --> 24:07.420
Well, let me tell you a couple other things.

24:07.741 --> 24:10.044
The military science building, the Trigon, was here.

24:10.084 --> 24:20.198
The business administration building, I can't remember the name of that now, but it was, you know, that's where I had a lot of my courses were there.

24:20.238 --> 24:26.746
Of course, military science, you could have been in the Corps, and I did have a contract that went into the Army for two years.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.110
I was in that building a lot.

24:29.170 --> 24:35.398
From the Northgate, the systems building, we call it, was, you know, kind of a landmark over there.

24:36.205 --> 24:42.135
Kyle Field was single decked other than that.

24:43.337 --> 24:52.011
The west stands there was that little section I think Bear O'Brien had built in the 50s that went up to a press box and gave us some second decks.

24:52.031 --> 24:54.735
Each part of that structure is still under the second deck you can see.

24:55.056 --> 24:58.922
I always enjoy looking at that.

25:01.028 --> 25:10.922
G. Raleigh White, you know, and it's always amazing to me because we used to build, we had about 7500 fans here, students here, and we used to build that place.

25:11.363 --> 25:13.446
It truly was a holler house on the ground.

25:13.466 --> 25:24.522
And after I was married, my wife and I went to all the football games and went to most of the way games that we'd been driving distance even, and we went to

25:24.839 --> 25:27.262
You know, virtually all the basketball games.

25:27.302 --> 25:32.770
I remember missing a basketball game that was a big game for us, very important, because I had a job interview.

25:33.651 --> 25:36.095
And that was kind of my introduction to the new world.

25:36.115 --> 25:39.479
I was going to talk about the dormitories.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.223
There were basically two places to live.

25:42.303 --> 25:44.086
Well, there were three.

25:44.106 --> 25:48.552
They had the area where the Corps is now.

25:49.358 --> 25:57.910
And then they had the dormitories over where I lived, which there were in Northgate, which there were four there at the time.

25:57.970 --> 26:04.299
There was dorm 14, 15, 16, which ran kind of in a row, and then 17 ran.

26:04.579 --> 26:09.005
We'd go from north-south, whereas the others ran east-west, basically.

26:09.025 --> 26:13.071
And then they had Hard Hall, and

26:13.945 --> 26:19.673
Henderson Hall is where the athletes lived there, and that was over near where I lived in the Northgate area.

26:20.113 --> 26:24.239
The chapel was here then too, by the way, I remember that as I'm thinking.

26:24.259 --> 26:32.911
The Quack Shack was just right in that area, not too far behind the chapel as I remember.

26:33.992 --> 26:38.238
And YMCA of course was here in the big time.

26:38.278 --> 26:41.843
What did the YMCA, what activities were there?

26:44.354 --> 26:45.956
Do you remember having any?

26:45.976 --> 26:46.376
No.

26:46.577 --> 26:47.918
The Koch building was over there.

26:47.958 --> 26:54.166
That's another building, because we used to go in there to, I mean, that was registration, a lot of things in there, fees and that type of thing.

26:54.186 --> 26:55.487
The Y, I don't remember.

26:55.567 --> 26:59.252
I think housing was in there then, but I could be wrong.

26:59.272 --> 27:01.034
I didn't go in the Y a lot.

27:01.094 --> 27:02.436
Religious Emphasis Week, do you remember that?

27:02.516 --> 27:05.399
Yes, remember Religious Emphasis Week.

27:05.419 --> 27:07.662
Skona was, you know, big going then.

27:08.519 --> 27:16.348
The other thing I remember is the big thing was the dances, you know, the combat ball, the military ball, the sophomore ball.

27:16.428 --> 27:17.189
Describe those.

27:18.050 --> 27:23.216
Well, those were special because you brought women, you know, you had a date come in for the weekend.

27:23.856 --> 27:30.644
I was lucky because I had relatives here, so my dates could stay with some of either my cousins or my grandmother.

27:30.664 --> 27:33.447
And once Mary and I started dating, she stayed with my cousins a lot.

27:33.832 --> 27:37.777
who lived just on the south side of campus, just off a little bit.

27:37.797 --> 27:40.340
How did a date get from San Antonio?

27:41.421 --> 27:44.605
Well, Mary would usually ride with someone.

27:44.645 --> 27:55.958
One time her folks let her have the car, which was interesting, because she was a senior in high school at the time.

27:56.461 --> 27:57.883
I mean, some came by bus.

27:58.123 --> 28:01.528
I don't remember any coming by train, although that may have happened then.

28:01.548 --> 28:05.553
I don't think there was a lot of train activity going on then.

28:05.573 --> 28:12.924
I've ridden the train out of here some back, but that's back when I was here in the 40s or the 50s, not going to school.

28:12.944 --> 28:25.641
And you'd always, gosh, you'd go out to eat and you'd show them the campus and the dorms would be open during certain hours where they could come in.

28:26.161 --> 28:26.642
Where?

28:26.662 --> 28:33.191
Where did, if you were taking a date out to eat or party, where would you take it?

28:33.232 --> 28:37.578
Well, Hotard's Cafe, our cafeteria was a place.

28:37.638 --> 28:40.262
Youngbloods, I think, was a chicken place here then.

28:41.464 --> 28:44.248
The Texan was, you know, here at Drive-In.

28:44.328 --> 28:46.111
I mean, Drive-Ins, there were a number of those.

28:46.311 --> 28:48.675
And I don't mean Drive-In movies.

28:48.695 --> 28:52.320
I mean, of course, the Circle Drive-In movie was there, but...

28:52.537 --> 28:54.661
that were drive-ins where you'd go eat.

28:55.002 --> 28:57.086
There wasn't a lot of really fancy places.

28:57.126 --> 29:03.318
Of course, I didn't have the money to do a lot of fancy eating.

29:03.338 --> 29:09.710
Again, I was fortunate that if I had a date like Mary would be here, my grandmother would usually want her to come over and eat lunch Sunday.

29:10.492 --> 29:13.718
My cousins might want to feed us Saturday.

29:14.609 --> 29:20.256
Then the dances were usually in Cebiza and they'd decorate that place up.

29:20.317 --> 29:26.705
Combat ball, you'd wear fatigues and combat boots and military ball and others you'd wear dress uniforms.

29:26.725 --> 29:29.409
It was always special to have women on campus here.

29:29.949 --> 29:33.594
Which of the dances was the most special?

29:33.774 --> 29:34.916
Oh gosh, I don't know.

29:35.036 --> 29:38.280
Cotton ball was another one they used to have here, I remember.

29:40.203 --> 29:44.228
To me, I guess it was special as when you had your date was

29:45.592 --> 29:46.814
worked out or not, you know.

29:48.056 --> 29:51.941
And were there any big-time orchestras that did those?

29:52.582 --> 29:54.826
You know, there may have been.

29:54.886 --> 29:55.687
I don't remember.

29:55.907 --> 29:57.770
You know, we had Town Hall back then.

29:57.790 --> 30:00.955
That's where any of the entertainment big names I remember.

30:00.995 --> 30:08.166
Benny Goodman, who younger people won't remember, but you would remember Benny Goodman came here for Town Hall one time.

30:08.526 --> 30:10.109
And where did he perform?

30:10.129 --> 30:11.110
At Guyon Hall.

30:11.917 --> 30:16.203
I mean at Gee Wally, that's where all the performances were.

30:16.223 --> 30:19.527
Ray Conniff, who was a big band guy that I used to like a lot.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.392
Pete Fountain, those were just some names I remember.

30:23.412 --> 30:30.782
The Peter, Paul, and Mary brothers four were types of entertainment that came in here, but that's away from your question about the dances.

30:30.862 --> 30:36.490
I don't, there were orchestras, but I don't remember them as, you know, and I'm sure they were

30:37.246 --> 30:42.233
I guess the military ball was probably one of the ones that was kind of special.

30:42.253 --> 30:47.842
Obviously the senior rain dance was the big one, and I was married then.

30:47.942 --> 30:51.107
But Mary and I used to go to those dances as married students.

30:51.748 --> 30:56.535
Did Tessie's come down, and if so, how?

30:56.555 --> 30:57.536
Well, you know, I don't know.

30:57.556 --> 31:05.548
I never had dates with them, but they used to come down, and there'd be a group of them come down.

31:05.933 --> 31:10.660
A lot of that would be if somebody had a date, they'd bring other girlfriends.

31:12.482 --> 31:15.446
We played football in San Antonio my sophomore year.

31:15.947 --> 31:19.111
Mary set up about eight of my friends with blind dates over there.

31:19.692 --> 31:22.456
Were there moose pots and beast buckets?

31:23.477 --> 31:25.360
Well, I don't remember moose pots.
