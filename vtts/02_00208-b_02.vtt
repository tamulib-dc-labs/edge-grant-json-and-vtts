00:03.001 --> 00:06.870
I get an education and exist and help each other 
exist. That was really a strong part, Haskell, of

00:07.311 --> 00:11.782
helping each other to exist. Give examples of 
that. Where did y'all help? Where did y'all pull

00:15.090 --> 00:16.152
together? We pulled together in the classroom. We 
pulled together in having our meals when you had a

00:20.112 --> 00:27.950
special party or something. Boy, everybody dug as 
deep as they could to get together and have

00:27.970 --> 00:32.140
something.

00:34.887 --> 00:38.475
Protected each other from upperclassmen.

00:39.282 --> 00:47.870
It was the camaraderie and the assistance that you 
had from your fish old lady and from your

00:39.282 --> 00:47.870
classmates all the way through was, you couldn't 
do without it. I don't know what I would have done

00:48.351 --> 00:58.460
had not I had those close, close friends that went 
through the same thing that I was going through.

01:00.983 --> 01:06.488
Were there some special events that contributed 
to this Were there some special Aggie traditions?

01:09.617 --> 01:10.138
Oh, yes. We had our parties out at the clay pits. We 
had our parties out at, oh goodness, it was out here

01:15.567 --> 01:23.920
on Highway 6 and 21 intersection. I don't know if it 
was VFW, not VFW, but one of those type of buildings

01:24.659 --> 01:29.426
out there. That's where Aggie Corps units could go 
have their parties and drink, okay, get

01:30.067 --> 01:38.558
completely away from the campus, and that was 
condoned. The clay pits was condoned. Now, your

01:42.163 --> 01:45.108
outfit never went to the river and partied, did it? 
The clay pits, of course, is on the river. Oh, all

01:50.876 --> 01:51.156
right. And that, and I couldn't tell you how to get 
the clay pits right now. I remember one of my quack

01:56.983 --> 02:01.828
shack visits was as a result of the clay pits. I got 
blistered out there and got pretty bad burns and

02:01.848 --> 02:07.814
had to get some medical attention for that. Too 
much sunshine blister. Way, way too much

02:09.276 --> 02:13.160
sunshine, you know, all day affair. But this 
pulling together did silver taps and muster

02:13.300 --> 02:20.788
and... Things like that. Now, Haskell, of course, 
you know, those were very special to you. But

02:25.481 --> 02:30.729
Silver Tap was a rarity, really. You know, I can 
only recall maybe three or four Silver Taps my

02:30.749 --> 02:37.399
whole undergraduate career. That was just not 
that common of an occurrence. I mean, there were

02:40.844 --> 02:44.910
only, you know, what, 5,000 to 7,000 of us or 
something like that. The community was just not

02:45.050 --> 02:47.113
that big. So that was a little bit different than 
maybe what it is today. It might also have been a

02:52.336 --> 03:00.985
little bit more hollowed back then, too, because 
when they cut lights out, they cut lights out. And

03:01.403 --> 03:02.784
there was no talking. I mean, it was quiet as a mouse 
on that campus and was until the next morning. I

03:09.010 --> 03:12.653
recall that we went back to our dorm and went to bed 
after super tabs. And nobody fudged, nobody

03:12.673 --> 03:15.235
cheated? No. No, no, it was very solemn. That's 
what I heard. Very solemn. What did you and your

03:19.479 --> 03:26.625
buddies, how often did y'all see and what did y'all 
think about the president of Texas A&M in that era?

03:28.206 --> 03:31.309
That man who was the new president when you got 
here. You know,

03:32.200 --> 03:36.808
very visible. He was visible on campus. His dog was 
visible on campus. Now, was his dog treated

03:43.739 --> 03:45.963
equally with Reveille? Oh, I hope to tell you, more 
equally. Absolutely. You bet he was. Ranger had

03:51.452 --> 03:58.444
the run of the campus every bit as much as Reveille 
did.

04:00.820 --> 04:09.092
You know, I don't have any strong recollections as 
an undergraduate student too much of him, other

04:00.820 --> 04:09.092
than he was visible, he was available.

04:11.656 --> 04:15.802
I believe that, I'm trying to think when his home 
burned. That's after, that's 68. Was that 68? See,

04:19.822 --> 04:23.227
I was a PhD student at that time. Actually, I was 
teaching and working full-time, but I was going to

04:24.488 --> 04:30.176
school part-time to try to finish up a doctorate 
degree. But I remember my father-in-law helping

04:30.597 --> 04:36.685
move things out of that house as it was burning. My 
father-in-law worked for the ground maintenance

04:36.745 --> 04:40.971
department at the university. Let's see. This is 
another note to the typist. Please put this in as an

04:44.535 --> 04:46.538
editorial note. According to Edwin Cooper, Edwin 
H. Cooper, who was Mr. Rudder's assistant at that

04:50.993 --> 05:11.175
time, as the fire in the house gradually, over a 
period of the morning, got worse, they were moving

04:50.993 --> 05:11.175
things out, and Ed said, as far as he knows, the last 
thing that they got out of the house, before they

04:50.993 --> 05:11.175
couldn't go back in at all and get anything, Mr. 
Rutter pulled him aside and told him to go in

05:12.286 --> 05:17.942
through the back door into a certain closet and 
look up on the second there was a case of Tiger

05:18.226 --> 05:28.997
Teague's favorite whiskey, and to get that and 
bring that out, that he didn't want that to be

05:18.226 --> 05:28.997
discovered by anybody else. My father-in-law 
says he brought it out. Is that right? Okay. I don't

05:33.781 --> 05:34.262
know. He told me that many times, that one of the 
last things that came out of that house was a case of

05:34.302 --> 05:40.468
whiskey. What did you all think about President 
Runner? What was your attitude about him? How did

05:45.533 --> 05:46.714
you all feel about him? Haskell, I think my 
knowledge and awareness and attitudes of Rudder

05:46.694 --> 05:57.868
were so...

05:59.654 --> 06:15.274
maybe rethought and recolored in later years that 
I don't really remember too much of those

05:59.654 --> 06:15.274
undergraduate academic years because I had the 
opportunity to, you know, to sit around Rudder a

05:59.654 --> 06:15.274
few times later on in my career. And so I have a 
different perspective maybe. Do you agree with me

06:21.301 --> 06:26.268
in looking back in retrospect, he did not make a lot 
of speeches. No. He was not colorful. But there was

06:29.725 --> 06:33.111
no doubt that he was in charge. He was in charge, and 
he had people that was in charge. I remember the

06:35.977 --> 06:41.287
director of campus security as an undergraduate 
student. He was an old Texas Ranger. Oh,

06:44.553 --> 06:49.343
gosh, Haskell. I can't remember that name either. 
But he, too, was in charge. Yes, and when he said

06:53.852 --> 06:58.477
that something was going to happen on campus, it 
happened that way. And you know where that was

06:58.878 --> 07:06.026
coming from, not only that he was an old ranger, a 
Texas ranger, but it was coming from Earl Rudder,

06:58.878 --> 07:06.026
okay? Now, Dean Hannigan was not here. Yes. Was he? 
Yes. All right. What did you all think of him? All

07:13.195 --> 07:19.122
the rumors were that Dean Hannigan was a very stern 
disciplinarian that tolerated absolutely no

07:19.287 --> 07:24.936
nonsense, and he had a cadre of folks working for 
him. I wish I could think of some of those guys'

07:25.477 --> 07:30.365
names that were just as tough as he were. They were, 
listen, when you put the Commandant and Dean

07:30.785 --> 07:35.693
Hannigan And those folks that worked for Dean 
Hannigan together, they were a bunch of stern

07:36.533 --> 07:44.720
disciplinarians that did not want a lot of 
nonsense going on. And they tolerated you going

07:44.960 --> 07:51.146
out and getting into some devilishness every once 
in a while. But they were pretty, they were stern

07:51.206 --> 07:53.348
disciplinarians. Every last one of them. I 
remember that. Now, in the fall of 1963, you're a

07:57.792 --> 08:01.855
serious student. Very serious. You're married. 
Very married. And where were you when you heard the

08:05.558 --> 08:12.687
news just before Thanksgiving?

08:14.149 --> 08:31.431
Kennedy, Haskell, I was sitting in an old 
Studebaker, and by this time it was a 59 large

08:14.149 --> 08:31.431
station wagon Studebaker. And I don't remember 
all the particulars of it, but I remember getting

08:32.272 --> 08:43.750
out and walking into the A&M Press, now the A&M 
Printing Center, where my wife was working. And I

08:45.032 --> 08:54.227
can't put all of those events together, but I 
remember it was just a lot of goodness what has

08:45.032 --> 08:54.227
happened. So you heard it on the car radio? Yes, I 
did. In my case, I had just finished class in Nagel

08:57.550 --> 09:08.281
Hall when in Garland Bayless's office, we were 
going to go to lunch at 1 o'clock to beat the crowd to

08:57.550 --> 09:08.281
go to the MSC. And I said, come on, let's go, let's 
go. He said, I'm listening to the radio. And I said,

09:11.164 --> 09:12.185
you can listen to it. He said, listen. And at that 
moment, I leaned over and Walter Cronkite said,

09:13.626 --> 09:18.431
I've just been handed a bulletin. President 
Kennedy is dead. I want to believe that I had

09:21.174 --> 09:27.540
probably gone to the printing center or the A&M 
Press to pick up Etta to have lunch together, or

09:27.959 --> 09:34.550
maybe even to have sack lunch there in the 
building. I do not remember the real particular, I

09:34.650 --> 09:44.667
don't even remember us leaving there and going to 
lunch as a matter of fact, but that's where I was

09:34.650 --> 09:44.667
when that happened.

09:45.808 --> 09:54.102
Were you aware during that time, and if you were, 
are you able to comment about any secret

09:45.808 --> 09:54.102
fraternities at Texas A&M? Not aware of any? No, I 
was not. But no, I knew of none. All right, back to, I

10:03.023 --> 10:16.562
can't think of any other events during your 
undergraduate days that would have caused you to

10:03.023 --> 10:16.562
remember where you were when you heard the news 
that. No. Because I can't think of any. Like

10:21.819 --> 10:26.283
December 7, 41, everybody remembers that one. 
Yeah, I was three months old. Let's see. I do

10:31.688 --> 10:34.150
remember my undergraduate years. I remember A&M 
Integrated. Oh, yes, describe. First of all.

10:40.036 --> 10:40.596
Describe. First of all. It happened. What was the 
attitude of the typical students that you knew

10:48.233 --> 10:55.581
What were the attitude about the students about a 
non-compulsory core? You know, that probably

10:55.601 --> 11:05.912
was, it was just kind of, I don't think there was any 
big hassle one way or the other for anybody. I don't

11:06.633 --> 11:10.557
see that as having been just a real blazing issue. 
Co-education?

11:17.242 --> 11:22.255
Probably a little bit more of an issue, talked 
about a little bit more often.

11:24.842 --> 11:28.050
Maybe don't need them, why, that sort of thing. If 
there had been a referendum, what do you think the

11:29.433 --> 11:33.985
vote would have been? I may be wrong, but I think it 
may have been let them in, because I can remember,

11:34.252 --> 11:49.648
and so many of us can remember, writing your post 
office box up at TWU or at Sam Houston and picking

11:34.252 --> 11:49.648
the girls up off the buses when they came into town. 
See, I believe if there had been a secret ballot...

11:53.132 --> 11:55.814
I think they would have voted the way I would have 
voted, let the women in. Yeah, I believe that. What

11:57.496 --> 11:58.437
about integration? It just happened. There was no 
fanfare to it. Was there any opposition at all? No.

12:03.498 --> 12:07.724
I don't even remember anyone even saying that, 
hey, it's going to happen or anything else. It just

12:07.744 --> 12:08.465
happened. And best I recall, I think it was when I 
was a senior. I think it was fall of 63 when it

12:12.591 --> 12:16.596
happened, and it just happened. No, there was no 
opposition and very, very smooth. And as far as I

12:23.223 --> 12:29.789
know, Sterling Evans was one of the key men in 
making it happen when it did.

12:32.611 --> 12:37.275
Let's see, you didn't do any Aggie hitchhiking, so 
you don't have any hitchhiking. No, I didn't have

12:37.295 --> 12:38.056
to. My brother did. He tells a lot of stories about 
it, but I did not. Did you ever get any Tessie dates?

12:44.601 --> 12:46.062
Oh, goodness, yes. Now, how did you meet some 
Tessies in the first place? How did you know who to

12:51.407 --> 12:52.808
write to? just wrote a post office box number. And 
if it came back, there was no such post office box

12:55.667 --> 13:01.297
number, you'd come up with a post office box 
number, you know? Did you have some fun occasions?

13:04.382 --> 13:07.648
Yeah, there were good times. Now, haven't I heard 
about beast buckets and moose pots? Moose pots,

13:10.974 --> 13:14.099
yes. Those were true, those were true. And that was 
for the... the guy that had the ugliest date. And

13:20.772 --> 13:23.379
they probably had something on the other end as 
well. Oh, yeah, that's true. Yeah, those

13:24.322 --> 13:25.084
happened. They sure did. When the girls came down 
here, how were they treated? Oh, with a great deal

13:29.592 --> 13:31.053
of respect. I mean, it was just like, hey, I mean, 
you know, it's not like they came down here for wild

13:31.153 --> 13:37.879
parties. They came down here to enjoy a weekend, 
football games and what have you. No, it was very

13:43.184 --> 13:48.009
sane, very docile, very nice. Now, you were not a 
dancer, so you didn't take any of them to dances.

13:51.952 --> 13:52.893
Oh, I tried to. Oh, did you? No, I was not that 
successful at it. But, yeah, we went, sure, yeah.

13:58.398 --> 14:04.665
And we made all the military balls and that sort of 
thing and, you know, stumbled around and that sort

13:58.398 --> 14:04.665
of thing. Student indulgences then, what were 
Aggies drinking, those who did drink? Haskell,

14:10.451 --> 14:14.196
you know, you could go out to the river. Whiskey 
Bridge. Whiskey Bridge and buy, oh, the, They'd

14:22.107 --> 14:27.837
buy gin, slow gin, you know, wine. I can remember 
the old saying, you know, what's the word?

14:34.167 --> 14:34.788
Thunderbird. What's the price? 30 thrice. What's 
the reason? It's drinking season. What's the

14:38.454 --> 14:39.296
reaction? Satisfaction. They'd make us as 
freshmen go through that over and over and over.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.544
And as far as I can recall, there was only a couple 
places where you could find beer. There was just

14:50.625 --> 14:52.127
not that many places. Uncle Ed's was still going? 
Yes, Uncle Ed's was still going. Goodness, that

14:58.213 --> 14:59.714
seems like that's about it. Most of the drink in 
high school was restricted really to the core

15:01.496 --> 15:14.288
outfit parties that would happen once or twice a 
year. And that was about it. And there was an

15:16.087 --> 15:19.694
arrangement to get everybody back to the campus. 
Oh, yes. Yes, there was, as a matter of fact. In

15:22.820 --> 15:31.836
fact, do you remember, in all of your 
undergraduate days, do you remember a death, DWI

15:22.820 --> 15:31.836
death? No. No, I do not. I do remember seeing drunk 
Aggies, especially after court parties, but I

15:35.513 --> 15:43.386
don't remember ever hearing or knowing of a drunk 
DIW deaf, no. And occasionally an Aggie would hide

15:43.767 --> 15:50.217
a fifth or a pint somewhere in the wall? Yes, and 
occasionally get caught. There wasn't a

15:55.907 --> 15:59.112
bootlegger, and I've never heard of a bootlegger 
in Brazos County. Did you ever hear of any

15:59.132 --> 16:01.015
bootlegger?

16:04.792 --> 16:17.987
I would know of guys that would go somewhere and 
come back into town with contraband liquor. And

16:19.950 --> 16:21.912
Pedlet. Oh, and Pedlet. Yeah, sure. But there was 
no dealer, no bootlegger dealer in Browns County

16:25.056 --> 16:30.001
that I've ever heard of. No. No, nothing I know of, 
no. Was the chicken ranch still in existence? Yes,

16:35.885 --> 16:37.847
the chicken ranch was in existence. And was there a 
kind of an Aggie tradition supposedly to?

16:43.072 --> 16:49.538
Haskell, I think maybe there was some tradition 
there, but I don't think it was near as great as what

16:43.072 --> 16:49.538
everybody made it out to be. As the story has 
become? As the story has become. I can remember

16:52.501 --> 16:59.908
once or twice in the Corps, the whistle jock. And 
I'm pretty sure some upperclassmen put the

17:03.983 --> 17:14.877
whistle jock up to this, but blowing the whistle 
and hollering, fall out for the chicken wrench.

17:16.118 --> 17:23.087
And, you know, everybody look out in the hall, 
there'll be nobody, you know, really going

17:16.118 --> 17:23.087
anywhere, but I can remember that happening. And 
But I don't remember, I don't know of anybody that

17:23.547 --> 17:36.946
really, that was a place that Aggies went to. Oh, it 
was talked about, and I'm sure it did. I'm sure

17:39.930 --> 17:44.577
there were frequent visits from A&M students to 
the chicken ranch. There was all sorts of stories

17:44.557 --> 17:46.020
back there. You go there because that's where all 
the University of Texas girls were. So I don't know

17:50.189 --> 17:53.996
how much validity to any of those old stories were. 
But yeah, it was still there. In terms of smoking,

17:55.960 --> 17:58.245
what were Aggies smoking? Oh, cigarettes, man. 
They were smoking Kimmel's, Sir Walter

18:00.659 --> 18:04.385
Raleigh's.

18:07.930 --> 18:09.954
Some guys were smoking Kuhl's. They were menthol, 
menthol Kuhl's. That was pretty much it. Some of us

18:16.464 --> 18:20.930
would, I even smoked a pipe a little bit during 
those days, you know. Not much cigar. No. Chewing

18:25.557 --> 18:26.138
tobacco? No. Didn't see much chewing. I don't 
recall anyone chewing tobacco, as a matter of

18:28.803 --> 18:31.326
fact. Now, I chewed tobacco when I worked for the 
highway department during summers and what have

18:31.366 --> 18:36.192
you. I'd get out on a dirt job, and I'd chew tobacco. 
I claimed to keep dirt out of my mouth. But I don't

18:41.679 --> 18:45.563
remember chewing being a frequent thing on 
campus. Smoking was pretty heavy. They gave

18:47.426 --> 18:48.947
cigarettes away on campus. We got the little four 
cigarette packs. Particulate registration.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.174
Yeah, you got it. Uh-huh. Did you even know the 
terminology of drugs? I'm glad you asked that. Let

19:04.954 --> 19:06.055
me tell you a story. When I was in high school,

19:06.155 --> 19:21.155
even though some people call that some of the 
redneck part of Texas and the architects area,

19:06.155 --> 19:21.155
there was no drinking problem or a drug problem. In 
fact, I can remember four of my high school

19:21.195 --> 19:26.822
classmates drinking beer, getting caught, and 
the school principal calling a school assembly in

19:27.663 --> 19:42.496
the auditorium on a Monday after these guys were 
caught on a Saturday drinking beer and making all

19:27.663 --> 19:42.496
four of them stand on the stage and apologize to the 
student body. And that kind of put a quietus on that

19:44.117 --> 19:49.341
kind of nonsense. I honestly do not remember even 
hearing the word marijuana when I was in high

19:50.242 --> 19:57.028
school. And no, there was no drug culture that I am 
aware of, not even in the slightest, when I was at

19:57.768 --> 20:05.961
A&M. It was a simpler era. It definitely was. All 
right, you say that racial integration went very

20:12.412 --> 20:18.021
smoothly. Were you on campus when some of the first 
women enrolled? Yeah, see, I was, well, let me see

20:22.693 --> 20:25.817
now. See, there was a time period in there where 
they were doing some summer classes. Oh, they

20:29.523 --> 20:30.704
always could do that. And they were doing, let me 
think here a minute. Maybe there was some

20:35.331 --> 20:44.304
preliminary letting the ladies enroll or make 
application for vet school or something. I can't

20:45.105 --> 20:47.248
remember what that was. But of course I was 
teaching when we opened the doors. I can remember

20:54.762 --> 21:02.035
my first engineering class I taught where I had a 
few ladies in the classroom. Yeah, I can remember

21:02.055 --> 21:02.997
that well. What was it like for them? Oh, I'm sure it 
was strained in a lot of ways for them that they were

21:04.745 --> 21:24.610
looking around, but I think most of them knew, 
especially in engineering, hey, we're going into

21:04.745 --> 21:24.610
a male-dominated world anyway, so this is just the 
way it's going to be, and maybe even until today

21:04.745 --> 21:24.610
engineering is still a little bit 
male-dominated, but... I think that was a very

21:25.619 --> 21:29.464
smooth assimilation as well. I don't recall it 
being any particular harassment. I'm aware of

21:34.231 --> 21:44.986
some of the minor, I call them minor, some of the 
things that happened, you know, with the girls in

21:34.231 --> 21:44.986
the corps and band and some of those things. But as 
far as having girls in my classroom and what have

21:45.027 --> 21:50.274
you, well, that was just as smooth as it could be. I 
remember later on when I was in the dean's office,

21:55.606 --> 22:02.852
having to instruct a few faculty members to tone 
their classes down a little bit. Had to threaten to

22:03.615 --> 22:07.810
remove one from the classroom because of his 
obnoxious vocabulary that he just couldn't seem

22:08.110 --> 22:15.442
to clean up for his classes. He should have been 
cleaned up for the males, as far as that goes, but it

22:15.462 --> 22:22.813
was particularly obnoxious to the ladies, and I 
can remember that. The early, the first women,

22:23.114 --> 22:32.008
female students, academically, were they, in 
general, quite capable? Haskell, you know, the

22:32.950 --> 22:40.324
ones that I had in the civil engineering classes, I 
don't remember any of them being poor students. I

22:40.344 --> 22:42.408
don't remember a single one being a poor student. I 
think that's been true. And when I went to the

22:43.690 --> 22:51.465
dean's office, you know, I hit the dean's office 
part-time in 74. and then replaced Cliff

22:52.070 --> 22:54.814
Ransdell, if you will, in 75. I say replaced. Cliff 
Ransdell was ready to retire. In fact, Cliff

22:59.520 --> 23:06.368
stayed with me for a year on a part-time basis to 
make sure I didn't fumble and fall too many times.

23:06.508 --> 23:15.240
And I remember those days, our girls were just 
absolutely exceptional. And we had more of them in

23:16.141 --> 23:18.584
the harder curriculum. We had them in chemical 
engineering. some of those areas, and they were

23:21.297 --> 23:25.402
just absolutely tearing the curves up. They were 
just outstanding students and taking a lot of

23:26.163 --> 23:34.133
leadership positions in the Student Engineers 
Council and those type of organizations. So, no,

23:34.173 --> 23:43.525
this was a very smooth assimilation into the 
College of Engineering, I can assure you, and we

23:34.173 --> 23:43.525
were delighted to have them, absolutely 
delighted to have them. If you'll remember, the 70

23:43.505 --> 23:53.734
to 80 was that real dynamic growth period, and 
especially if you take the 74, 75 through 80

23:43.505 --> 23:53.734
period, that's when A&M just blew. And when I 
walked out the doors my last day as a dean in the

23:54.575 --> 24:08.748
College of Engineering, there was 9,070 
engineering students, and it was a handful. I

24:08.928 --> 24:11.730
mean, it was, and most of those were 
undergraduate, you know. That was what year? That

24:13.087 --> 24:14.628
was 1980. So that engineering within 15, 16 years

24:16.470 --> 24:28.501
had 2,000 more students than the institution had 
had. You got it. Absolutely. It sure did. Yes.

24:32.965 --> 24:35.467
Yeah, that was such a dynamic period, but it was 
fun. That was the most fun part of perhaps my career

24:35.547 --> 24:40.512
was those years over there. Back to undergraduate 
days, when you bought that ring, do you remember

24:40.711 --> 24:46.660
how much it cost? Yes, $28. Where did you get that 
money? My brother. My brother came through with

24:53.291 --> 24:55.575
that $28. And, you know, the story is the 
Association of Farmer Students was paying the

24:56.196 --> 25:02.586
other half of the value of the ring. How did you feel 
when you put it on? There is no way to describe it.

25:07.694 --> 25:10.999
You know, you just couldn't hold your hand out far 
enough. You couldn't show it off enough. It was

25:13.202 --> 25:16.086
just absolutely an unbelievable event in life. 
Why are Aggies so, why is an Aggie ring so important

25:16.466 --> 25:22.555
to Aggies?

25:29.344 --> 25:30.065
It's a symbol. I mean, it's a designation that you 
belong, man, that you're part of it. And there's no

25:34.610 --> 25:39.435
question that you're a part of it, that you didn't 
quit too early, that you didn't make it. You really

25:39.915 --> 25:48.364
are a part of what A&M is all about, and that tells 
everyone that sees you, man, I'm a part of

25:39.915 --> 25:48.364
something great. And I still believe that. Oh, I do 
too. Until today, I believe that. And as an outside

25:52.148 --> 25:59.976
observer, I think one of the keys is that it hasn't 
changed in design, appearance, and so forth. but

26:00.277 --> 26:01.860
just a tiny, tiny bit. That's right. So that if you 
ever recognized it one place, it will look the

26:02.402 --> 26:06.952
same. That's right. And you've heard the stories 
of being stopped everywhere imaginable.

26:12.925 --> 26:16.172
Haskell, that ring has been seen all over these 
states for sure. What are your favorite ring

26:16.192 --> 26:19.399
stories, where somebody saw it or... Oh, my wife 
and I and the three kids made a summer trip to D.C. I

26:28.109 --> 26:35.658
had a summer presentation to the Highway Research 
Board of the National Academy of Sciences up there

26:28.109 --> 26:35.658
one summer. And we were standing on a corner in 
the... Oh, goodness.

26:46.150 --> 26:47.091
The... What do you call the area in between the 
Capitol and the... Oh, my. My brain gone to sleep.

26:54.478 --> 26:59.205
Boy, mine went to sleep on me, not the quadrangle, 
but in the mall area. And there was a

26:59.566 --> 27:06.436
high-ranking military officer. I don't remember 
now exactly whether he was Army or Air Force. It

27:11.236 --> 27:19.251
really doesn't matter, but he saw my Aggie ring, 
introduced himself, and he was an Aggie and said,

27:11.236 --> 27:19.251
what are you doing here? I said, well, I've got a 
presentation later today. I told him where it was,

27:22.958 --> 27:31.354
and I said, my wife and the three kids are going to do 
a little tour around Michigan the mall area here

27:31.334 --> 27:37.603
and maybe catch some of the Smithsonian exhibits 
and what have you. And it was almost lunchtime and

27:37.683 --> 27:44.173
he said, well, what are the plans for lunch today? 
And I said, well, I'm going to be leaving here in

27:44.714 --> 27:50.082
just a few minutes and I've told them to find 
something. He said, well, they just found it. And

27:52.405 --> 27:56.471
he carried my wife and the three kids to lunch. So I 
remember that one very well. And other occasions,

27:58.534 --> 28:01.138
airports. Always. You know, I've traveled most of 
my professional career, hundreds of air flights,

28:01.839 --> 28:13.195
and very seldom would you ever go into an airport, 
even strange airports, that someone would say,

28:01.839 --> 28:13.195
hey, what class are you? Or come over and introduce 
themselves. You've never lost it. I've never lost

28:15.858 --> 28:16.940
mine. My brother lost his three years ago, class 
51. It was completely slick. He lost his, and he's

28:22.587 --> 28:26.012
wearing one now that looks like a brand new one. He 
was almost self-conscious about it, but no, I

28:25.992 --> 28:29.740
never lost mine. My daughter lost her first one in 
Lake Somerville, and I lost it three or four years

28:30.221 --> 28:37.075
after graduation. That's it. And you didn't buy 
senior boots? Oh, yes. Oh, you did? Yes, I did.

28:41.344 --> 28:41.925
Where'd you get them? I had two pair of senior 
boots. I had a pair of senior boots that my sister

28:45.743 --> 29:00.927
gave me from a friend that she knew in Houston, and 
they were my everyday boots, okay, that first

28:45.743 --> 29:00.927
semester of my senior year when I was in the Corps. 
And then I bought a pair of hand-me-down boots from

29:00.907 --> 29:13.038
an upperclassman that fit, and those were my drill 
and ceremonies senior boots. So I had two pair, and

29:13.058 --> 29:19.684
I sold the drill and ceremony, the real nice pair, 
and I kept the old pair. I still have those. And was

29:22.006 --> 29:30.053
your first final review wearing boots a special 
time? Yes, it was very special. I can recall it like

29:34.131 --> 29:36.635
it was yesterday. Had special people in town for 
the occasion, and yeah, it was very special. And

29:42.764 --> 29:46.911
commencement, when you graduated? My mom came 
down, and all

29:48.894 --> 29:57.947
of my brothers and sisters came down, all five of 
them. My wife and her family was there, and I think

29:58.788 --> 30:11.029
even her sister and her husband, and he was an 
Aggie, I think they were there. Very special

30:12.391 --> 30:15.636
occasion, yes, very special. Every name called? 
Oh, yes, every name called. I don't remember it

30:22.683 --> 30:30.258
being Roger Feldman, but every name was called, 
and that was a very special feeling to walk across

30:22.683 --> 30:30.258
that stage. As you look back on those 
undergraduate days, how well did it prepare you

30:30.679 --> 30:42.683
for A&M's undergraduate program prepare you for 
your future? Haskell, there was no question when I

30:43.743 --> 30:47.589
graduated I thought I could slay the world. I 
really believed that, that I was as well prepared

30:47.970 --> 30:56.463
as anyone anywhere to do whatever I well pleased to 
do, whether it was in engineering or do something

30:47.970 --> 30:56.463
else. And I had committed to myself during that 
senior year that I was going into academics. And my

31:04.856 --> 31:11.927
department head, who was Saul Wright, he was civil 
engineering department head when I left, Told me I

31:12.447 --> 31:17.884
could go to graduate school, but I need to go out and 
have an adjustment for a couple of years.
