WEBVTT

00:03.794 --> 00:11.345
I wanted to see those things continue and advance 
uninterrupted. We were on the verge of really

00:11.365 --> 00:32.637
bringing this university to a level of academic 
statue that it had never had before because we were

00:11.365 --> 00:32.637
finally getting to a stage of maturity after the 
decisions that Dr. Rutter, I mean, President

00:33.072 --> 00:38.719
Rutter had made of the expansion and all that had 
been put into the university. And we were

00:38.980 --> 00:44.187
beginning to reap a lot of what you and others had 
done previous to our time. And I had spent so much

00:45.088 --> 00:54.360
time completely redoing the entire 
undergraduate academic program in focus. What

00:54.741 --> 00:59.687
were some of those major changes?

01:02.671 --> 01:10.200
so many new programs such as

01:02.671 --> 01:10.200
the Center for Teaching Excellence. We had put in a 
graduate student teaching enhancement program.

01:15.326 --> 01:19.832
We had put in a student advising program from the 
academic side. We had put in new strengths into the

01:21.213 --> 01:31.125
tenure and promotion criteria so that credit 
would be given to our best teachers and that that

01:31.426 --> 01:36.571
would be a criteria upon which they would be 
judged. We had strengthened the funding to the

01:38.834 --> 01:46.541
academic program side at the undergraduate 
level.

01:49.645 --> 01:57.012
There are probably four or five more that we had put 
into it, but also along with that, We had done

01:58.274 --> 02:07.243
things to increase the faculty's training in the 
academic process and in the classroom teaching.

02:08.684 --> 02:11.827
When you look at education, it involves two 
components. One is the content and the other is the

02:12.027 --> 02:15.010
delivery. So we were really working hard to look at 
the delivery and what we could do to enhance it.

02:19.674 --> 02:25.280
Secondly, we had also worked hard on recruiting 
top students here. We had gotten Texas A&M up to

02:26.827 --> 02:32.854
third in National Merit Scholars. We had gone 
ahead of the University of Texas. We should just

02:34.897 --> 02:36.078
gall them. And who deserved credit for that? Well, 
a lot of that came from the team that we put together

02:38.541 --> 02:44.809
in the provost office and all of the associate 
provosts. We now had an associate provost for

02:45.310 --> 02:48.874
undergraduate studies. And it was that person's 
responsibility to work with the academic deans in

02:50.216 --> 02:56.023
all the colleges to really pay attention to what we 
were doing in expanding our honors courses, our

02:56.813 --> 03:04.482
advanced courses. We then had in that office, an 
office for honors and, yeah, an office for honors.

03:15.395 --> 03:15.976
Who led that? Dale Noble? Dale Noble. And Dale was 
superb at getting out in the state and helping us

03:19.259 --> 03:25.707
recruit those top-notch students. And I spent a 
lot of time traveling with Dale to high schools.

03:31.179 --> 03:35.103
And I spent a lot of time at events he would have here 
on campus. We spent a lot of time also recruiting

03:36.324 --> 03:41.290
top notch minority students. And we put in place 
the outreach centers in the various strategic

03:41.410 --> 03:54.985
areas of the state to try to get top notch minority 
students who were National Merit Scholars or

03:55.133 --> 04:03.627
National Hispanic Scholars, students who were 
really bright and bring them here. So we put a lot of

04:03.647 --> 04:06.471
time and effort into those kinds of things. Who was 
the key coordinator of the minority recruitment?

04:11.940 --> 04:15.285
A lot of that came under Sally Shepherd who was the 
Associate Provost for Undergraduate Studies.

04:21.182 --> 04:32.196
Among the deans that you work with, I'm not going to 
ask the negative, which of the deans would you give

04:21.182 --> 04:32.196
the highest marks to in those years? Well, I was 
blessed to have some excellent deans and then I was

04:32.697 --> 04:42.690
given the opportunity to recruit

04:32.697 --> 04:42.690
almost all of the deans. during my time frame from 
senior vice president, provost, through my whole

04:43.396 --> 04:51.447
time in the president's office. And clearly, 
Benton Coconauer in the College of Business. Dick

04:58.877 --> 05:04.545
Ewing is a dean that I recruited that has just done a 
fantastic job in the College of Science.

05:08.070 --> 05:11.715
There's no question but what Ed Heiler in the 
College of Agriculture. John Shattuck did a

05:12.303 --> 05:15.727
terrific job for the College of Indian Medicine. 
You know, it's hard when you start answering

05:17.109 --> 05:21.195
questions like this because you don't want to 
leave anyone out.

05:25.380 --> 05:31.908
Walter Windler, who is now in the Chancellor's 
office, did a great job with the College of

05:25.380 --> 05:31.908
Architecture. I recruited the first woman dean 
ever at A&M. It was Jane Stallings for the College

05:37.095 --> 05:41.601
of Education.

05:42.290 --> 05:47.956
Those deans formed such an incredible team. One 
other one that was not a dean's title, but I made it a

05:48.777 --> 05:57.907
dean's title, was the dean of libraries. I

05:59.889 --> 06:04.975
should remember her name also. Fred Heath. Oh, are 
you talking about Fred Heath? Fred Heath. Oh,

06:08.178 --> 06:08.799
yeah. I recruited Fred Heath. and felt like that he 
had the vision to move our library forward because

06:11.872 --> 06:27.136
we put a tremendous amount of effort into the 
current new expanded facilities to get that done

06:11.872 --> 06:27.136
and increase the funding. He certainly is doing a 
good job. And to get it technically advanced and

06:28.538 --> 06:35.449
Fred had the know-how to get it technically 
advanced. On your staff, who were the key people?

06:39.980 --> 06:42.182
Oh, that's easy. Jeanette Ferris, who to me is, if 
there's ever been someone that would be termed the

06:42.562 --> 06:58.437
institutional memory and know-how of Texas A&M 
University, it would be Jeanette Ferris. But she

06:59.137 --> 07:00.198
is one. Jerry Gaston, who was my executive 
associate provost. Danny Parker, who was

07:06.361 --> 07:12.250
assistant provost for business affairs. They 
were absolutely key and crucial. Where did you

07:16.436 --> 07:18.178
find Jerry Gaston? Jerry was already there. Oh, 
okay. And he was executive associate provost

07:20.943 --> 07:28.554
under Don McDonald before I went to that position.

07:31.538 --> 07:35.524
I made a lot of other changes when I was senior vice 
president provost. One was to bring the graduate

07:36.247 --> 07:50.301
educational programs, the masters and the PhD, 
and the research to one office. They were so

07:51.863 --> 08:06.017
closely linked, and yet with two different 
offices there was a lot of wasted money and

07:51.863 --> 08:06.017
overhead, and they were unable to bring it 
together the way it needed. And I made some tough,

08:06.757 --> 08:09.340
hard decisions in that area. And some people 
probably in those offices got upset. But if you

08:13.645 --> 08:17.129
don't make those decisions, then you're 
fostering mediocrity. So I brought those

08:17.730 --> 08:27.281
together into a position that was called Vice 
President for Research and Associate Provost for

08:17.730 --> 08:27.281
Graduate Studies. Because so much of the time, 
your research funding is what funds a lot of your

08:33.689 --> 08:36.554
graduate positions. So we brought all that 
together and tried to give it a higher level of

08:37.114 --> 08:53.480
visibility in the university to give us a greater 
presence in Austin and particularly a greater

08:37.114 --> 08:53.480
presence in Washington, D.C. At a meeting of the 
deans, we used to call it the academic, the APC.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.343
Academic Programs Council. If there was a 
discussion and a difference of opinion, which of

08:55.643 --> 09:09.824
the deans with the other deans do you think would 
have been the most persuasive? Was there any dean

09:11.746 --> 09:21.761
that could move some of his or her colleagues more 
than the others?

09:23.724 --> 09:24.705
Probably. for

09:26.035 --> 09:30.101
two reasons. One was that he had a superb program in 
the College of Business, but secondly, he had also

09:30.421 --> 09:55.215
served as an academic vice president and provost 
at another institution and had a background that

09:30.421 --> 09:55.215
was recognized among the others and his people 
skills did a lot.

09:58.570 --> 10:09.486
And did you have a person that you would have 
listened to most closely for truly candid advice?

10:10.168 --> 10:19.261
Yeah, I had two people really, and that would be 
Jerry Gaston and Danny Parker, because we were all

10:10.168 --> 10:19.261
just side by side in the provost office. And Bill 
Perry, I have to also add Bill Perry. associate

10:24.845 --> 10:29.232
provost and dean of faculties, and I brought Bill 
into that position. And I had forgotten him a

10:30.374 --> 10:35.943
moment ago as such an important part of that team of 
people. So when we had decisions that needed to be

10:36.804 --> 10:49.485
made, we were right there in my office, and those 
were my confidants, and they were people I really

10:36.804 --> 10:49.485
trusted. Now, Bill replaced Clint Phillips when 
Clint retired. That is correct. Bill replaced

10:54.093 --> 10:58.578
Clint Phillips and had come from the College of 
Science. A superb teacher of math. A superb math

11:01.422 --> 11:02.723
teacher. According to our children. And still, 
when he was associate provost and dean of

11:04.805 --> 11:14.357
faculties, he said, I will do it if you will still 
let me teach one course a semester. And I said,

11:14.377 --> 11:17.380
Bill, I would want you to do that. I did that every 
semester of my whole life. First of all, it keeps

11:23.143 --> 11:25.825
you in contact with the realities. No question. 
Absolutely. Let's see. Any funny moments you can

11:29.008 --> 11:31.030
remember? Goofy? Hilarious? Something came 
apart?

11:41.600 --> 11:46.624
Well, one of the funniest was the incident I told 
about the gas, running out of gas. And oh, I'll tell

11:47.853 --> 11:50.296
you one that was. I had my 50th birthday when I was 
senior vice president and provost. And I came into

11:59.465 --> 12:09.576
work that day and they had black balloons and 
things all over the administration building in

11:59.465 --> 12:09.576
that beautiful rotunda. And I thought, well, 
that's the end of it. And that was a Friday. The next

12:13.360 --> 12:17.725
day at the football game, we're up in the 
president's box. And at halftime, I look up, and

12:18.177 --> 12:22.824
here comes the airplane. Oh, my goodness. And the 
airplane has this big trailer on it, and it says,

12:23.645 --> 12:29.233
EDG is old. Happy 50th birthday. And about that 
time, they all started looking at it, and they all

12:31.456 --> 12:39.688
brought out these whistles and balloons and 
everything. And we had a party in the president's

12:39.748 --> 12:46.378
box, and it was a great, great time. Okay, now let's 
go back to when you became the, and the title was

12:46.544 --> 12:51.354
interim? Interim president.

12:54.982 --> 13:00.213
Was there any surprise that Bill Mobley was 
selected as chancellor? No, I don't think so at all

13:00.854 --> 13:04.722
because Bill had done such a superb job in leading 
the university to a new level of achievement. And

13:08.658 --> 13:16.631
secondly, he had also served as the executive vice 
chancellor second in command of the system. So he

13:16.651 --> 13:19.215
had clearly proven himself. All right. And did, as 
you became the interim president, is that the

13:20.657 --> 13:31.755
word? Were there any problems created for you by 
the manner in which you were identified? Yes.

13:42.298 --> 13:42.859
For me. A

13:45.263 --> 13:58.603
comment or two.

14:04.220 --> 14:17.572
And

14:04.220 --> 14:17.572
that created some awkward moments. And I went to 
the faculty senate and felt that I needed to

14:19.334 --> 14:31.645
explain why I had accepted it, because it was out of 
my loyalty to continue to move the university

14:19.334 --> 14:31.645
forward. But I was placed in a very awkward 
situation at that time, no question. And this

14:38.577 --> 14:46.347
occurred, this transfer took place when? It took 
place in August of 1993. August of 93. And you were

14:52.836 --> 14:56.040
still living in your home. Right. So there was no 
discussion of your moving to the President's home

14:56.781 --> 15:00.826
at that point. There was, and we were allowed to if 
we wanted to, but my wife and I determined that We

15:06.590 --> 15:13.981
might not, if I were a candidate, want the 
position, and if I were a candidate, I didn't want

15:06.590 --> 15:13.981
to give a presumptuous impression. Although we 
did stay there some, and we did use the home quite

15:15.344 --> 15:23.977
frequently for many kinds of entertaining 
events. So you became the CEO of the campus just in

15:24.317 --> 15:30.146
time for football season. Just in time for 
football season, which I must tell you was my

15:30.166 --> 15:34.453
favorite time of the year. describe how that way. 
Well, I'm a huge football fan. And I will tell you

15:38.936 --> 15:46.343
that it was not the regular routine football 
season. Because during the whole fall, we were

15:46.663 --> 16:01.037
trying to wrap up the entire NCAA investigation of 
that last infraction issue. And I spent hours upon

16:01.057 --> 16:04.120
hours with in meetings with university people, 
with investigators. We hired a firm out of Kansas

16:08.896 --> 16:15.770
City that had a track record of getting to the 
bottom of all of these. I know them well. That's

16:16.532 --> 16:17.614
their specialty. I know them well.

16:22.257 --> 16:30.930
The whole time I was going through football season 
and going to the football games, I was still

16:22.257 --> 16:30.930
handling those issues on a daily basis. But 
football weekends were, to me, very special.

16:36.298 --> 16:40.965
Describe a typical home game football weekend. A 
home football weekend started Friday. And it

16:44.350 --> 16:51.100
started mid-morning Friday with a lot of events, 
people coming to town that wanted to see you. A lot

16:51.687 --> 16:56.073
of things were sponsored by the Association of 
Former Students. There were usually meetings

16:56.914 --> 16:58.877
that they had. Every college had development 
council meetings. All kinds of meetings on

17:03.383 --> 17:05.185
Fridays. So Fridays were just devoted to meetings 
and speeches. And I usually just pretty well in

17:09.591 --> 17:12.034
advance knew that. Saturdays of the football 
weekends were just crammed full and started

17:12.074 --> 17:20.766
usually with an early morning breakfast. What we 
had to do in order to get from place to place was very

17:21.573 --> 17:44.938
carefully scheduling in our office, but we had a 
student in a university vehicle that would

17:21.573 --> 17:44.938
actually drive me from place to place so that I 
could meet the time frames of where I needed to be.

17:45.658 --> 17:49.943
And it was not uncommon to have and go to six or eight 
events And one of the highlights to me was the

17:50.564 --> 18:17.955
pre-game meal where I got to thank the people who 
were there, introduce the legislators, the

17:50.564 --> 18:17.955
guests, the board of regents, the other 
university's president who was there, and to have

17:50.564 --> 18:17.955
a little presentation done by a student about some 
student program at A&M. And then the ball game and

18:18.408 --> 18:30.225
then after the ball game, I probably spent more 
time in the Hilton without spending the night

18:18.408 --> 18:30.225
there than anybody because all the class 
reunions. And I might speak to four or five of those

18:30.826 --> 18:36.074
in one afternoon or one evening and get home about 
midnight that night. But I will tell you that I

18:37.195 --> 18:44.987
enjoyed probably those speeches and that 
interaction as much as anything I ever did in my

18:37.195 --> 18:44.987
life. And I'll never forget And I probably 
shouldn't say that sitting here talking to you. We

18:54.510 --> 18:59.683
beat, I think it was the University of Missouri, 73 
to nothing. And it was the class reunion for the

19:03.650 --> 19:16.465
class of 73, and I told them, I said, I just want you 
to know that I instructed the team to score 73

19:03.650 --> 19:16.465
points for you, and they did it. And it was one of 
those unique opportunities that was there. So

19:20.529 --> 19:25.495
those were hectic weekends, and Sunday after a 
football game was a day of recovery.

19:28.559 --> 19:32.323
Give an example of a goofy request, proposal that 
somebody gave to you while you were in that CEO job.

19:37.785 --> 19:38.647
Remember anything? Well, I'll tell you one of the 
funniest things that ever happened and one of the

19:38.688 --> 19:45.283
goofiest requests we ever got was this written 
letter from this dear elderly lady, and you could

19:46.040 --> 20:15.000
tell it from her handwriting, who had watched, I 
think, that same ball game where we scored 73

19:46.040 --> 20:15.000
points, and she instructed me to have the students 
stop kissing their dates with French kisses after

19:46.040 --> 20:15.000
every touchdown, that she had watched it on 
television, and it was repugnant for her to have to

19:46.040 --> 20:15.000
watch, and that I needed to tell the students to 
quit doing that. let's see, proud moments well

20:15.807 --> 20:44.430
there were a number of proud moments and those 
would clearly be related to what I would feel would

20:15.807 --> 20:44.430
be landmark achievements one was the work done to 
get the finality of the Bush Presidential Library

20:15.807 --> 20:44.430
and particularly the facilities I'll never 
forget the humility of the Bush family, and how

20:45.305 --> 21:10.536
when we were in Houston meeting with the 
architects and called him up one Sunday afternoon

20:45.305 --> 21:10.536
when he was still president, he instructed the 
architect that he did not want that facility to be

20:45.305 --> 21:10.536
an edifice to George Bush, but he wanted the 
architecture and the facility to reflect Texas

20:45.305 --> 21:10.536
A&M University. We later had to go back and 
convince him to upgrade the finish to truly make it

21:10.769 --> 21:18.341
look like a presidential library. But a part of 
that was a great... Do you remember how you all

21:19.082 --> 21:28.356
heard the decision that it would be here? Yes. It 
happened earlier when I was senior vice president

21:29.839 --> 21:33.364
and provost. I believe that we were in a Board of 
Regents meeting. when we got the final word that it

21:39.473 --> 21:42.076
was going to be here. And of course, many people had 
a great part in that. A lot of board members. Was it a

21:48.061 --> 21:49.763
telephone message? I think probably it was a 
telephone message to a couple of the board members

21:49.783 --> 21:57.170
who had been very instrumental, and to Dr. 
Atkinson. And it was announced, and of course you

21:58.232 --> 22:08.221
can imagine the joy that swept through this entire 
campus and our university.

22:08.241 --> 22:08.822
Oh my, yes. an achievement that I would be very 
proud of would be Reed Arena. We had been stymied

22:17.259 --> 22:23.206
and stopped at every avenue to get that facility 
completed. The coordinating board was against it

22:24.267 --> 22:29.493
and it had gotten out of size. Some of our board 
members actually wanted it to be larger than the

22:30.815 --> 22:37.122
Super Drum in Austin and that's what got a 
jaundiced view of it by the state. So we knew that we

22:40.831 --> 22:45.256
were going to have to cut it back and the board 
agreed with that. So we finally got it cut back and

22:45.336 --> 22:56.388
internally we were ready to go, but we could never 
get back over the hurdle of what had happened in the

22:45.336 --> 22:56.388
governor's office at that time and with the 
coordinating board. And I actually had a board

22:57.530 --> 23:06.720
member or two and some in the university that had 
started putting together a proposal to renovate

23:07.544 --> 23:21.344
G. Raleigh-White and I must admit I became pretty 
upset about that because that would not solve a

23:07.544 --> 23:21.344
long-term solution and we would gain no seats and 
we'd still have an old antiquated facility. So we

23:22.546 --> 23:35.745
were on Texas Southern University's campus 
making a presentation to the Coordinating Board

23:22.546 --> 23:35.745
when the chairman of their committee that 
approved new construction dr santos a physician

23:36.147 --> 23:59.050
from lubbock was there and this presentation we 
were making was about the bush presidential

23:36.147 --> 23:59.050
library well they were supportive and all that 
went well and at the end of the meeting dr santos

23:36.147 --> 23:59.050
turned to me and he said well mr president what are 
you going to do about your special events center

24:00.295 --> 24:05.943
And I told him, I said, well, sir, we need it badly, 
and we'd love to come to you and you give us approval

24:00.295 --> 24:05.943
where we could go. We've got the funding. And I 
said, there are some that are wanting, since we

24:08.606 --> 24:12.832
can't get approval, to renovate G. Raleigh White. 
He said, well, I can't support that. He said, you

24:15.776 --> 24:16.817
deserve it. A&M deserves it. He said, you know, if 
you did that to G. Raleigh White, that would remind

24:18.680 --> 24:24.227
me of something. He said, you know, you can put a 
silver saddle on a jackass, but he still looks like

24:24.730 --> 24:29.978
a jackass. And he said, that won't work. He said, 
you guys put your proposal together and come see

24:32.522 --> 24:36.608
us. Did he say that in a public session? Oh, yes. It 
was a public session. Now, it was mostly just

24:41.996 --> 24:48.506
people who were from universities making a 
presentation. So we went to see him, and he agreed

24:48.526 --> 24:50.469
to it. From then on, it was... approved all the way 
through. The other major achievement was moving

24:56.482 --> 25:05.813
Texas A&M from the Southwest Conference to the Big 
12. And that was an exciting time. Describe all

25:10.638 --> 25:11.920
that you can. Well, I will describe almost all of it 
that I can. I want everyone to know that we held out

25:21.903 --> 25:34.960
to the very end, we being the presidents of all of 
the Southwest Conference schools, we held out to

25:21.903 --> 25:34.960
the very end that all of the Southwest Conference 
schools would go, all eight. But it became very

25:36.021 --> 25:49.598
evident early that the new Big Eight, I mean, I'm 
sorry, the new Big 12, the other schools, would not

25:36.021 --> 25:49.598
accept the University of Houston, Rice, SMU, and 
TCU. And the reason they wouldn't was the fact that

25:55.387 --> 26:20.023
their attendance was so low that it would drag down 
the whole conference and it would drag down the

25:55.387 --> 26:20.023
television packages and revenue stream that had 
to be put together for survival of the larger

25:55.387 --> 26:20.023
programs. We would have been left out if we had 
stayed in the Southwest Conference, we being the

26:21.320 --> 26:30.268
big schools. And we could never have negotiated

26:31.929 --> 26:50.466
the kinds of television contracts that 
unfortunately are essential to survive in

26:31.929 --> 26:50.466
today's big university athletics. So we knew that 
we had to do something. Now those four schools,

26:53.681 --> 27:05.014
because two or three years earlier, the attempt 
had been made to make the change, and the

26:53.681 --> 27:05.014
legislative bodies stopped it at that time. But 
what they did at that time, they put some

27:05.174 --> 27:16.166
parameters of achievement in that these other 
schools that had not been drawing attendance had

27:05.174 --> 27:16.166
to achieve, and they hadn't done it and couldn't do 
it. So it was then a time where it could now happen.

27:20.433 --> 27:22.616
And we had meetings all across the state. The last 
one that I recall was in Dallas across from the

27:22.656 --> 27:43.144
airport where we finally determined that the 
other four universities probably were not going

27:22.656 --> 27:43.144
to be able to follow us to join what was at the time I 
guess the Big Eight.

27:46.007 --> 27:48.651
There were discussions occurring outside such as 
the University of Texas was leaning toward

27:49.660 --> 27:58.873
wanting to go to the Pac-10 so that they could be in 
with Stanford and UCLA. Well, we didn't want any

28:00.415 --> 28:08.567
part of that, and we didn't think that probably 
that would get a very favorable response from the

28:00.415 --> 28:08.567
state legislature. I had a board member or two 
wanting to take A&M to the Southeastern

28:10.330 --> 28:18.942
Conference. Well, we did not want to go to the 
Southeastern Conference for two reasons. One was

28:25.569 --> 28:30.074
their academic statue was nowhere near the 
schools in the Big Eight. And secondly, they had

28:30.875 --> 28:38.663
more NCAA problems than any of the other schools. 
And it was already huge. So the presidents began to

28:46.141 --> 29:00.954
talk to the chairman, who was the president of the 
University of Colorado, to finalize how the four

28:46.141 --> 29:00.954
schools would go then to what is now the Big 12. 
Well, A&M and Texas were still the two big dogs,

29:02.675 --> 29:07.299
more than Texas Tech and Baylor. And there was a 
little hesitancy to accept them. And since UT was

29:13.684 --> 29:15.726
talking to pack 10, the chancellor and I were at 
Scott and White and Temple one afternoon, and we

29:16.297 --> 29:31.352
get a call from Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock, 
and Mr. Bullock says, I want you in my office at 4

29:16.297 --> 29:31.352
o'clock this afternoon. So when Mr. Bullock 
called, he went to Austin. So we wrapped up our

29:35.497 --> 29:43.705
meeting, and we drove to Austin as fast as we could, 
and it was a driving thunder rainstorm I'll never

29:35.497 --> 29:43.705
forget. And it rained and thundered and stormed 
the whole time we were in his office. And I walk into

29:48.182 --> 29:52.286
his office, and here's Mr. Bullock. Here is John 
Monford, who was chairman of the Senate Finance

29:52.306 --> 30:00.556
Committee and a Texas Tech grad, and from Lubbock. 
And here was David Sibley, senator from Waco, and

30:01.538 --> 30:07.905
ties, of course, clearly to Baylor. And here was 
one of my board members, Board of Regents And Mr.

30:13.992 --> 30:20.560
Bullock says, I want you to know that everything is 
still moving. And that I've heard you are all going

30:21.701 --> 30:28.529
to the Big 12, A&M and Texas. And I clearly want you 
to confirm to these other two schools that you're

30:29.631 --> 30:38.041
not going somewhere else and leave them out. And I 
want you to confirm that you'll support them for

30:38.582 --> 30:43.948
entry into the Big 12. And he also got the chairman 
of the board on the phone and asked him what the

30:45.245 --> 30:51.434
position was. Chairman of the A&M board. Chairman 
of the A&M board. And then he got Bill Cunningham on

30:54.659 --> 30:57.823
the phone. And he said, Bill, you guys are not going 
to Pac-10, are you? And he said, no, sir. We're all

31:03.271 --> 31:09.641
going to go as the last four schools here at the 
Southwest Conference to what will be the new Big

31:03.271 --> 31:09.641
12. And he said, well, I want you to come over here. 
And I want you to be in the room and tell these guys

31:12.164 --> 31:14.728
this. So, you know, he was just cementing what we 
had worked for a good while to pull together that we

31:15.232 --> 31:27.807
would then form the new conference.
