WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:07.137
Because up to that time, we were not teaching 
neuro. The student in anatomy knew the brain and

00:08.378 --> 00:17.431
the gross parts of the brain, and that was about 
all. And he had to know more than that as a basis for

00:17.451 --> 00:30.308
his clinical material and for physiology, 
because they were getting into neurophysiology

00:17.451 --> 00:30.308
then. the central nervous system was becoming 
more and more important as time went on, because we

00:31.385 --> 00:41.837
were getting more drugs that acted on central 
nervous system and what have you. So you have to be

00:42.258 --> 00:49.386
aware of what's happening, and you have to know the 
part that you're working on. Just as I told, I was in

00:49.406 --> 01:01.240
a meeting of the American College of Veterinary 
Pathologists in Chicago at the Kellogg Center,

00:49.406 --> 01:01.240
oh, I guess about 15 years ago. And I criticize the 
pathologists for not knowing their

01:01.996 --> 01:08.425
neuroanatomy. You pick up an article and here's a 
disease on the central nervous system. It affects

01:12.170 --> 01:18.439
the cerebellum or it affects the brain stem. And 
they tell you nothing about where it is, what motor

01:18.459 --> 01:29.014
nucleus or sensory nucleus or what tract or 
anything else that's involved. It's just in this

01:29.034 --> 01:31.918
great big piece of brain. It's not pinned down 
anywhere. So how can you draw any deductions on

01:35.291 --> 01:38.095
that? You cannot. Except that it's an involvement 
of the central nervous system. Or as a

01:46.046 --> 01:51.052
veterinarian used to say, he's got some kind of 
central nervous system disease. Some kind of.

01:52.815 --> 01:55.278
Some kind of a nervous system disease. And that's 
about all he knew about it. So I did get that. I did

02:03.472 --> 02:06.615
get a good course in neuroanatomy. And when I came 
back here in the early 50s, then we began making up

02:06.655 --> 02:20.027
class sets of every animal species or domestic 
animal. The cow and the horse, the sheep and the cat

02:22.429 --> 02:33.259
and the dog and chickens and what have you, turkeys 
and anything else, and monkeys. Baylor Medical

02:33.712 --> 02:36.155
School was very nice to me. I don't know how many 
human brains they let me have. And I worked up class

02:42.063 --> 02:44.706
sets in human brains. And we went from the human to 
the cow and the horse and so on. We took what we

02:51.836 --> 02:58.825
learned from the human, because we had a human 
textbook, the same that they were using in

02:51.836 --> 02:58.825
Galveston Medical School. And we went from there 
down into domestic animals for comparison. It

03:04.299 --> 03:05.681
was, of course, in comparison. That sounds 
tremendous. It was, even if I do say so. No, that

03:11.689 --> 03:14.413
sounds like just a great idea. The students didn't 
like it. Why not? Simply because the practicing

03:17.517 --> 03:23.866
veterinarians who didn't know neuroanatomy.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.951
What are you studying that stuff for? What are you 
going to do about it if you find they've got some

03:28.100 --> 03:32.526
kind of a nervous condition? What are you going to 
do about it? So the students, some of them got the

03:35.890 --> 03:43.160
idea that this is a waste of time studying all this 
stuff. So I had to fight that idea too. But now it's

03:47.425 --> 03:51.070
a- I think it would help them with understanding. 
Comparative medicine, I think, would be very

03:51.235 --> 03:54.822
important. Isn't there a new, in veterinary 
medicine, let's turn to veterinary medicine,

03:54.963 --> 04:03.480
just the discipline of veterinary medicine. It 
appears to me that there's been more, after

04:03.961 --> 04:11.016
talking to a number of your colleagues, that 
there's been a more and more specialization.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.639
Absolutely. From the time that you graduated 
until today. And, of course, with more and more

04:16.164 --> 04:20.371
PhDs too than ever before. And isn't comparative 
medicine one of those fields? Absolutely.

04:28.924 --> 04:29.104
Yes, sir. So I said to the students, you are going to 
have medical doctors as clients. Yeah. And they

04:39.616 --> 04:48.146
are going to ask you questions if this animal 
happens to have a central nervous system

04:39.616 --> 04:48.146
involvement. They're going to want to know, where 
is the lesion? And what are you going to say? You

04:56.816 --> 04:57.497
don't know? Some place in the brain. Some place in 
the brain, or somewhere.

05:06.532 --> 05:17.187
I think gradually they began to adapt to the idea of 
neuroanatomy.

05:17.207 --> 05:17.988
I had that feeling. Now, one of our graduates in 
veterinary medicine is at Johns Hopkins now. Oh,

05:23.856 --> 05:24.597
really? And she's in neuropathology. And she 
wishes to high heaven that she had listened to me

05:27.081 --> 05:32.488
more in the course in neuroanatomy.

05:37.852 --> 05:42.016
So

05:37.852 --> 05:42.016
I said, you can't tell. You can't tell what you're 
going to be doing. Just like Ty Hardy. When Ty Hardy

05:45.279 --> 05:51.304
was going through here, our only graduate in 1930, 
he didn't care anything about small animals. All

05:52.805 --> 05:54.347
he wanted was large animals. He didn't want to fool 
with dogs and cats. Who's going to fool with those

05:56.569 --> 05:58.030
things? Well, when he got out, what did he do? Sheep 
and stuff and small animals?

06:06.698 --> 06:06.778
Huh? So you never know. What do you think about this 
10 trend toward specialization? What's your

06:16.040 --> 06:17.082
opinion of that? Well, I really don't know. I 
really don't know. I never went into that myself.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.502
What's going to become of it? It all depends on the 
population growth and the animal growth, the

06:36.003 --> 06:44.936
population of animals and so on, the number of 
veterinarians that we have, and the

06:36.003 --> 06:44.936
specializations that they're doing. I really 
don't know. To me, that's to come up. I don't know

06:52.686 --> 06:55.731
how they're going to do anything. I know up to this 
time why it's

06:55.751 --> 07:05.284
been a rather broad specialization, either small 
animals or large animals. or a milk and meat

07:06.378 --> 07:09.501
inspection work or something like that. Some of 
them, all animals, whether large or small. And

07:17.848 --> 07:24.814
some of them only cats, and some of them only dogs. 
They seem to be doing all right. Financially, I

07:28.137 --> 07:30.680
guess they're doing all right. Everyone I've seen 
says he's doing fine. Of course, that used to be the

07:37.225 --> 07:46.576
way you'd go to a veterinary meeting, a 
conference, and you'd see all these old boys that

07:37.225 --> 07:46.576
graduated back there when you do. You did. How you 
getting along? Oh, man, I'm really doing well. I

07:54.105 --> 07:56.067
just don't have any overhead at all. All I got to 
help him is a little black boy, and that's all the

07:56.167 --> 08:01.554
overhead, you know. You know darn well he's not 
doing that well. I think most of them have done

08:06.436 --> 08:15.126
well, they've done well in real estate, and they 
put their money wisely in other things.

08:20.632 --> 08:24.476
But I really don't know about specializations. 
Okay, one last question for tonight, and can we get

08:24.496 --> 08:29.222
together again? Sure, anytime you want to. Okay, 
and that concerns... the granting of graduate

08:37.317 --> 08:41.644
degrees here. Our first Doctor of Veterinary 
Medicine was granted in 1920, and then it was 15, 20

08:42.766 --> 08:58.313
years later before the first Masters, and it 
wasn't until 1955 that we granted our first PhD in

08:42.766 --> 08:58.313
Veterinary Medicine. Why did it take so long? It 
would be veterinary medicine. I wouldn't say

09:02.864 --> 09:04.987
veterinarian medicine. Yeah, exactly. 
Veterinary medicine. Why did it take so long? Who

09:09.794 --> 09:12.117
did we have to give a degree? Who did we have to give 
an advanced degree? We didn't have anybody who had

09:16.984 --> 09:19.848
a PhD.

09:22.732 --> 09:27.338
If you're going to give a PhD, shouldn't a PhD give 
it?

09:29.393 --> 09:39.423
Most

09:29.393 --> 09:39.423
of them just had a degree in veterinary medicine, 
and that's all they ever hoped to get. This was like

09:40.304 --> 09:45.029
advanced degrees in medical college. I asked some 
of the fellas down in Galveston, what about

09:45.049 --> 09:52.517
advanced degrees for you boys who have EMDs? Who's 
going to teach us? That's what the question is.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.523
Who's going to teach us? the ultimate. Who's going 
to teach us?

10:04.613 --> 10:09.478
So to me, it's very much the same way now in 
veterinary medicine. If you have a degree in

10:09.498 --> 10:18.627
veterinary medicine, heaven help us just for the 
catechism you go through, what do you want with

10:09.498 --> 10:18.627
more?

10:22.150 --> 10:26.434
But we have, at one time, and this hasn't been too 
far back the degree in veterinary medicine was a

10:27.325 --> 10:53.181
baccalaureate degree and we came last at 
graduation after all the other graduates walked

10:27.325 --> 10:53.181
across the stage v for veterinary came last and i 
said mr heaton why is that so you're just a

10:27.325 --> 10:53.181
baccalaureate degree you just have four years I 
said, well, it's Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.

10:59.403 --> 11:01.206
Well, it's just a baccalaureate degree. And we 
went under that cloud for many, many years. So

11:08.158 --> 11:18.134
degree in veterinary medicine, why, it was just 
like an AB or BS.

11:18.154 --> 11:18.274
Right. And that may have been in the back of my mind 
when I went on and got my PhD, just for prestige on

11:19.064 --> 11:29.798
the campus. What did I learn? I learned some 
neuroanatomy. Do you think that was in the back of

11:33.403 --> 11:34.985
your mind? Yeah, that was in the back of my mind.

11:40.733 --> 11:45.780
As one of our friends here in chemistry, a PhD in 
chemistry from Illinois, If you got a PhD in

11:47.566 --> 11:52.072
education, you didn't have a degree. You had to 
have an earned degree in one of those basic

11:53.534 --> 12:02.767
sciences, like chemistry. Then you had, this is 
his words, the degree.

12:19.325 --> 12:21.148
Yeah. You have a degree in veterinary medicine and 
I don't know, they sort of stuck in their crawl when

12:21.348 --> 12:30.663
they called you doctor. Because that's just a 
baccalaureate degree. Of course then we began to

12:35.651 --> 12:42.582
say two years of pre-vet and so on and so on and now so 
many of them have Four years, degrees and so on.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.741
Before they even get to it. Before they even get 
into veterinary medicine. Same way in human

12:50.723 --> 12:52.425
medicine. Time was in human medicine, four years. 
That was it. And well, from high school to medical

12:59.273 --> 13:02.877
college. And the old family doctor we had in 
Crockett, he said when he finished his sophomore

13:03.518 --> 13:12.028
year in Tulane, he went out in the, sawmill town in 
East Texas and practiced in the summers. And he

13:18.238 --> 13:24.026
said he had to remove arms and legs that got mangled 
up in the sawmills and so on. He knew more about the

13:25.148 --> 13:27.511
anatomy than anybody else. And so he was the guy. 
And as a sophomore from medical school, he was out

13:32.679 --> 13:38.067
there doing surgery. But medicine has come so far, 
so has veterinary medicine.

13:48.174 --> 13:59.269
And of course, the research that's gone on in the 
pharmacology and physiology and so on. The drugs,

13:59.290 --> 14:02.654
the new drugs that are coming out every day. Now 
it's interferon, maybe for cancer and so on. The

14:09.198 --> 14:15.729
electron microscope, electronics, it's 
miraculous. It really is, isn't it? Well, we're

14:19.075 --> 14:26.788
going to talk about, next time we're going to talk 
about the 1940s to the present. Well, good. OK.

14:28.671 --> 14:30.474
That's all right. So thank you very much for this 
interview. This ends the interview. This is Terry

14:33.799 --> 14:35.442
Anderson.
