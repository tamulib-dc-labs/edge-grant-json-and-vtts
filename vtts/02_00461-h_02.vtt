WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:18.174
Oh, another guy I

00:02.174 --> 00:18.174
met at that time was Lionel Wilson. He also came out 
to the courts.

00:23.441 --> 00:24.723
He's a black student, law student, just fresh out 
of law school. And he was married to a redhead. And

00:25.403 --> 00:26.325
lived in the same neighborhood in Oakland. And I 
went over to their house, met Dorothy. And

00:28.988 --> 00:37.561
he called me several times to want to play in 
doubles. There was a tournament, so we played

00:37.581 --> 00:39.584
several doubles in tournaments together. So he 
was another one. And then there was this one

00:41.567 --> 00:46.474
psychiatrist

00:41.567 --> 00:46.474
who came up. Yeah,

00:46.454 --> 00:53.883
in his second term, the mayor of Oakland. The mayor 
of Oakland. So many of these people have risen to

00:54.664 --> 00:58.408
dizzying heights. When we had the right to call 
them out, Lionel and Dorothy came down at one of the

00:58.448 --> 01:08.340
tournaments. Yeah. When I was director of tennis. 
Over the last several years, we would bump into him

01:10.940 --> 01:15.951
in celebrity tournaments. And then just 
recently, Dan is sending

01:15.971 --> 01:28.660
the postcard because he's been singing on TV. Oh, 
is that right? Yeah. Yes, there is. Oh,

01:32.908 --> 01:42.347
when I was marketing director for Brown 
Construction. I knew he was mayor, I'd seen his

01:42.766 --> 01:49.695
name at the end of the paper. I'd

01:50.516 --> 01:56.283
sent him our packet. I

01:56.984 --> 02:09.820
asked my boss if he thought it was a good lead in case 
there was any jobs to be done in Oakland, would they

01:56.984 --> 02:09.820
want to bid on it? And he said, yes, go ahead and mail 
him our packet. So I used him as a prospect for a

02:15.064 --> 02:21.510
construction business that I was making. But it 
never

02:21.530 --> 02:25.493
hurt. Let me ask the rest of you. Let me change the 
subject for a moment and ask you about your

02:28.816 --> 02:32.879
father's efforts to locate you. You didn't find 
out about that, of course, until you got hold of

02:35.642 --> 02:39.705
your sister. And then you found out that your 
father had put ads in the paper, tried to locate

02:40.208 --> 02:44.675
you. Do you have any, what are your feelings about 
your parents? How do you think your parents felt?

02:54.129 --> 02:55.812
They knew that you'd escaped. They were notified, 
yeah. How do you think they, because they couldn't

02:59.718 --> 03:03.764
reach you either. No, no. What do you think they 
were thinking? I'm sure he's okay. He's out there

03:07.583 --> 03:08.544
someplace. We trained him well enough so he could 
survive. I hope that's what they thought. Because

03:12.048 --> 03:20.317
my mother kept telling them, my nieces that she was 
raising, he's not taught. He's not taught. And he

03:23.080 --> 03:31.849
won't, you know, I think that's another endearing 
part of my life, in a sense. That, you know, to have

03:31.869 --> 03:34.212
parents... that cared for me, to look for me. Sure, 
sure. It isn't necessarily the finding, just

03:39.394 --> 03:45.980
sometimes, like in life, it's the pursuit of 
something. That's the important part, sure. Of

03:48.683 --> 04:00.655
course, it would be ideal if you have the pleasure 
of pursuit and finding, but it feels good. And my

04:02.120 --> 04:14.874
feeling has always been that I could see what he did 
was to prepare me for all eventualities, which any

04:02.120 --> 04:14.874
father would do, which I would do for every student 
I ever had. I would prepare him whatever I teach

04:15.775 --> 04:22.082
because I can't be there the rest of his life. But 
when I teach somebody to ski, I tell him the color of

04:22.482 --> 04:27.047
the snow. You won't find that in any book that 
there's white and there's white. There's cool

04:32.315 --> 04:33.856
white and warm white. It makes a difference on the 
drag of your skis. It might save your life if you go

04:37.280 --> 04:46.329
60 miles an hour and you go over a yellow spot 
because you're going to go head over tea cattle. Or

04:46.569 --> 04:50.052
the skis will go out from under you if you go over 
blue. Right. And you've got

04:51.614 --> 04:59.582
that training soldiers to go to Russia, training 
the soldiers on the drill field. He was preparing

05:02.633 --> 05:03.494
them. You pay $20 and I give you the best backhand in 
the world.

05:10.545 --> 05:12.588
I think that's an animalistic thing. You find it 
amongst the monkeys, the guys that teach the young

05:12.608 --> 05:21.000
chimps how to swing from tree to tree. Their 
mothers tell them how to eat right and

05:21.421 --> 05:29.012
comb their hair. and stay clean and shape up so that 
they survive.

05:37.684 --> 05:39.387
Do you have any questions? Were your dad's efforts 
to find you extensive? Did they go on for years?

05:44.114 --> 05:44.595
Yeah, evidently. And do you know whether he 
advertised in newspapers in the areas where you

05:46.498 --> 05:54.911
were and you just didn't see it, or whether he 
wasn't in the right location? I personally think

05:55.191 --> 05:58.797
he might have advertised in the San Francisco 
Chronicle. that's why i thought maybe herb kane

05:59.671 --> 06:21.612
picked up on that item but i that's just i never 
found it i went to look for it i simply got dizzy

05:59.671 --> 06:21.612
looking going back on in those years and i can't got 
a headache from i tried several hours at the morgue

05:59.671 --> 06:21.612
in san francisco to find any mention either of me or 
I wasn't looking for the ad at that time, but I would

06:22.115 --> 06:34.695
have seen, if I had seen my pictures and my name in 
Germany, like I saw that on that, I mean, it always

06:22.115 --> 06:34.695
jumps the graphics of my name. What makes you think 
that it might have been in the San Francisco paper?

06:39.260 --> 06:45.033
Because Lottie told me there were major 
newspapers that he advertised in. American

06:45.294 --> 06:46.036
newspapers. American newspapers. Maybe Los 
Angeles, or it could have been Los Angeles. Wire

06:51.608 --> 06:52.510
service. I mean, he could have seen it on a... I 
mean, not in the paper itself, like you say, it

06:56.270 --> 07:06.080
could have been a rival paper, but they get the same 
information from the... Just simply ask for the

06:56.270 --> 07:06.080
paper. Yeah, maybe someday I'll ask him if there 
was an ad in it. But he wrote that. But I never

07:12.987 --> 07:22.817
thought of running any ads in a German newspaper,

07:12.987 --> 07:22.817
since I had given up on Europe, per se.

07:26.324 --> 07:31.761
after I

07:26.324 --> 07:31.761
just didn't want to return to Europe. The only 
other question I had was a paranoia question. When

07:37.575 --> 07:59.081
you married

07:37.575 --> 07:59.081
Jean, I could see the paranoia going in two 
directions, either getting worse because

07:37.575 --> 07:59.081
suddenly you had somebody in collusion with you 
that didn't know she was in collusion and so you had

07:37.575 --> 07:59.081
to worry more, or whether since you decided to 
become more stable, whether you were able to relax

07:37.575 --> 07:59.081
and work that out. Do you remember what your 
reaction was very closely on the marriage itself?

08:00.623 --> 08:02.085
I would say... The feelings would constantly 
fluctuate between the two. So both were

08:10.299 --> 08:11.781
happening. Yes. In fact, that's probably a good 
way to describe all throughout that period. The

08:17.671 --> 08:23.080
very basic

08:17.671 --> 08:23.080
fear and flight. The constant courage and fear. 
press on and hide. And I've found out that is a very,

08:30.468 --> 08:39.042
very basic animalistic trait that we all have. 
I've probably had it more than others. But when I

08:40.905 --> 08:52.525
was studying the psychology of a tennis match, how 
to get yourself into a proper thing, you have to...

08:53.467 --> 08:59.816
wait till you get rid of your fear before you can 
make any kind of a good shot. Because as soon as the

09:00.637 --> 09:10.110
fear creeps into your body, the chemistry, like 
that match that I lost, that there's no way you

09:00.637 --> 09:10.110
cannot, that thing is just like concrete. You've 
heard of the expression, the frozen elbow or the

09:10.130 --> 09:14.496
concrete elbow. And it isn't just, you know, it 
probably was stronger than me. And it kept going

09:19.663 --> 09:22.427
back and forth and back and forth. But it's not 
unusual.

09:30.456 --> 09:35.423
And I don't know what I'd done if it wasn't there all 
the time. It must be nice, I guess. You don't have

09:37.485 --> 09:42.672
to... Well, everybody has secrets. Everybody 
has... I don't want you to think that you...

09:49.323 --> 09:52.646
lived a relationship that nobody else 
experiences. That's what I finally learned.

09:54.047 --> 09:55.729
Everybody experiences those things. That's what 
I finally learned. Just maybe the degree is

09:57.511 --> 10:00.113
different. Or the cues. You would suspect the cues 
sooner than I would. If you were starting to be

10:06.559 --> 10:12.424
asked questions, your defenses would go up a lot 
earlier than mine. Mine would go up too, and I think

10:12.464 --> 10:15.987
most men would, to being asked certain questions. 
But I think yours would go up sooner than mine.

10:26.110 --> 10:28.854
Gene, can I ask you a couple questions? Can I ask you 
to change places for a minute?

10:38.066 --> 10:49.422
Let me ask again what

10:38.066 --> 10:49.422
you thought when you were being rebuffed at these 
various points. I mean, there has to be... You're

10:49.442 --> 10:54.008
married to a man, all right, the marriage... You 
met at the dance. You got married in October. But

10:57.994 --> 11:01.701
still, you're dealing with somebody who's almost 
a cardboard figure on occasion. In the earliest

11:03.164 --> 11:07.272
stages of it, I really wasn't too concerned 
about... I didn't have that many questions. My

11:12.469 --> 11:14.673
primary concerns were about his health. If you're 
marrying somebody, you want to be pretty

11:14.833 --> 11:21.425
comfortable with their health, and he looked very 
robust. I worked for an insurance company at that

11:21.445 --> 11:24.771
time, and I urged him to go get an annual physical 
the first year we were married. He did do that.

11:36.041 --> 11:38.965
We were on the employee benefit plan. The doctor's 
report came back through my office, kind of a

11:39.585 --> 11:45.574
conflict of interest situation to say the least. 
Professionally, I deal with it. the claims coming

11:47.296 --> 11:57.811
in and it was my own husband and I felt like a lawyer 
in a sense reading his medical report but on the

11:47.296 --> 11:57.811
other hand I'm concerned about it because he was 
virtually a stranger when I married him. We had

11:57.831 --> 11:59.473
known each other for a long time. Nothing of his 
background and at that point in time I found out

11:59.493 --> 12:04.240
about his pneumonia. He'd never mentioned that 
and in his history whatever he did to the doctor

12:04.420 --> 12:11.430
showed up as an old some kind of old inflammatory 
changes in his lungs. So I called up the doctor and I

12:16.077 --> 12:23.909
explained to him this kind of dilemma that I was in. 
New bride, here's this information, and the

12:24.309 --> 12:28.536
doctor said, oh, don't worry about that. He said, 
your husband is basically a very healthy fellow.

12:31.901 --> 12:34.104
So I thought, okay, that's all I really need to 
know. I never told him that I had seen his medical

12:34.364 --> 12:37.108
report. You knew she had? But that's why he stalled 
for going to the doctor. I know how these things...

12:45.701 --> 12:48.124
Anyway, that kind of question. She is asking me to 
take an examination. She tells me to go see the

12:53.011 --> 12:54.614
doctor. The doctor is going to report to her.

13:00.702 --> 13:03.005
So you suspected that you were being put up to it. 
That's why I stalled. Were you being put up to it?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.252
Did you really want to see that report? No. 
Actually, I was very taken aback when the report

13:08.953 --> 13:12.021
came through. It didn't necessarily have to come 
through, but it happened to do.

13:18.637 --> 13:21.985
Okay, so that answered the basic questions. Could 
that report have... What I'm trying to respond to

13:23.230 --> 13:31.286
is when you said, what kind of questions did I have 
and how did I feel when I didn't get an answer? Okay,

13:31.667 --> 13:33.711
so the basic question was answered. He was 
healthy. Now I don't want to know, I don't want to

13:34.432 --> 13:41.526
pry about where did he get these things, changes in 
his life. He was healthy. In terms of the current

13:42.468 --> 13:45.894
reality, everything was okay. Let's not bother 
about the rest of it. So then, those early years of

13:48.459 --> 13:56.915
our marriage, very seldom did questions come up 
about any past history. And in my perception of

13:58.077 --> 14:05.050
things during those subsequent years and the next 
six, seven, eight years, whatever, very little

14:05.030 --> 14:13.825
came up in the way of necessity to threaten him 
about going before any kind of authorities. I was

14:14.783 --> 14:28.716
the front person in most all of our dealings, which 
was very easy for me to do because I was up to that

14:14.783 --> 14:28.716
point anyway, take care of all the financial 
returns, take care of all the practicalities. If

14:29.517 --> 14:32.399
we bought property, I filled out the forms. Faster 
for me to do that. He was busy with his job or

14:35.102 --> 14:37.024
whatever it was. I had access to telephone. So it 
just was kind of a natural thing to do, to fall into

14:38.605 --> 14:41.668
it. doing all of those things and then to skip way 
ahead when the time came then many years later for

14:42.239 --> 14:52.738
me to

14:54.541 --> 15:11.454
Well, I guess the best way I can phrase it is after 
many, many years of doing all of that for the whole

14:54.541 --> 15:11.454
family, and then the kids are gone, and then later 
on they're just the two of us, I became exhausted,

14:54.541 --> 15:11.454
sick and tired of doing all the tax work and all this 
stuff. And then I would put him in situations

15:11.474 --> 15:15.402
where... Why doesn't he go do it? And he wouldn't do 
it. So then my feeling of being, I was just, I'm just

15:18.743 --> 15:24.660
used up. I'm just, why won't you do it? Then came the 
hard questions. And the same in the areas of the

15:30.381 --> 15:36.956
emotionality about things. I think my perception 
was that he had used my emotionality about all of

15:37.157 --> 15:44.253
these other things. He didn't have to reveal. how 
or get caught in any kinds of traps about displays

15:46.567 --> 16:13.637
of emotions or he was you know just and I'm all this 
and I was just used up so now hard questions have to

15:46.567 --> 16:13.637
come how come you don't want to do this why don't you 
do that and not getting a satisfactory like you use

15:46.567 --> 16:13.637
in cardboard response so there was a lot of years 
when there was no confrontation about any of it

16:16.705 --> 16:43.843
by uncertainty yeah yeah uh did you begin to notice 
a breakdown of of uh defenses it seems to me i'm

16:16.705 --> 16:43.843
getting the feeling that we're repressed i'm 
getting the feeling that uh it was uh that dennis's

16:16.705 --> 16:43.843
defenses were either breaking down or showing you 
light in between them somehow that would

16:44.465 --> 16:47.610
encourage you to ask more, to demand more. It 
sounds as if he was almost saying, press a little

16:47.630 --> 17:04.436
harder and maybe we'll... That he was trying to 
cooperate on the inside, and you were trying to get

16:47.630 --> 17:04.436
to it on the outside, but that this wall that had 
been built up over years prevented you both from

16:47.630 --> 17:04.436
touching each other. That's quite possible. I 
think just in general terms, people get locked

17:06.439 --> 17:12.649
into whatever roles and responsibilities that 
sort of... sometimes by default. A lot of his

17:16.200 --> 17:29.678
responses to my behavior fit very well into this, 
because I was used to be the aggressive one, the

17:16.200 --> 17:29.678
business woman, and whether he even offered to do 
it, he may not have had a chance to. I might have just

17:29.698 --> 17:32.362
done it anyway. But you don't see a point at which it 
was starting to become that you sensed that he was

17:33.704 --> 17:40.493
trying to cooperate from the inside,

17:43.139 --> 17:59.275
Well, I thought that we always discussed these 
difficult matters, and that the fact that you

17:43.139 --> 17:59.275
actually went ahead and did it, like the actual, 
like the phoning and the setting up of the

17:43.139 --> 17:59.275
appointments and so on, I think that came much 
later in our marriage. I tried to be as supportive

18:01.536 --> 18:10.426
as I could in other ways, other than the actual 
doing of it. And obviously there was a lot of other

18:11.187 --> 18:15.832
kinds of... It's not anything that I enjoyed. 
That's a very bad part of being a... You're not a

18:25.057 --> 18:27.342
whole person. You're lucky. You try to be as whole 
as you can. I was trying to be as whole as I could. And

18:33.895 --> 18:38.664
the rest, like if I was three-quarter whole, I 
felt, well, that's me. The best you can ask for. The

18:39.486 --> 18:40.368
best you can hope for. That's the best I can ask for. 
And not to... well over the last quarter when you

18:43.467 --> 18:57.477
got three quarters and then later on i got more 
compassionate when i heard you read enough about

18:43.467 --> 18:57.477
the other unfortunate people and of course three 
quarters And my basic approach to that was, I'd say

18:57.676 --> 19:07.847
it to myself, you can only get so much, whatever is 
there of the person is all you can get. If there

19:08.227 --> 19:10.850
isn't any more, you will not get any more. Maybe 
he's just dull. Maybe that's all there was. Maybe

19:14.054 --> 19:14.514
he's dull. And I accepted that because he was such a 
good person, and I've said that in so many ways to so

19:14.534 --> 19:20.781
many people. his basic integrity his goodness all 
of those kinds of things you know he's kind he's all

19:20.761 --> 19:48.388
these other things so if there was if there was only 
this kind of level of affect coming maybe that's

19:20.761 --> 19:48.388
okay and i would have to deal with whatever might 
end up being deficiencies to me i'd have to deal

19:20.761 --> 19:48.388
with it in some other manner and that was okay for a 
long time but then it wasn't anymore what changed

19:20.761 --> 19:48.388
it I think I indicated there were several crises in 
my life going on. In her life? In my life. I felt like

19:59.045 --> 20:01.810
I was just going to be used. I was used up. Where did 
you find Dr. Bernstein's name, Mark Bernstein?

20:08.802 --> 20:13.971
No, we belonged to, as part of my benefit package. I 
have a health plan with one of the major clinics in

20:15.166 --> 20:19.392
Honolulu. And he was one of the staff 
psychiatrists. What building? A major building

20:27.465 --> 20:29.167
down south? So it's called Straub Clinic. It's a 
big clinic on South King Street in Honolulu.

20:34.355 --> 20:36.038
Straub Clinic. S-T-R-U-B.

20:40.504 --> 20:42.928
Tell me what, when you finally When the final 
crisis finally came, 1980,

20:44.427 --> 20:59.245
summer of 80,

20:44.427 --> 20:59.245
you have both seen Dr. Bernstein? No, no. We didn't 
see him until about September. Oh, wait a minute.

21:05.152 --> 21:06.955
Then I have the chronology wrong. I'm saying in the 
summer of 80, when I found out about Cheryl and I

21:06.975 --> 21:13.843
came back from Colorado, I was already set for the 
retirement. Yes. And come to, you know, whatever

21:16.876 --> 21:20.581
anxieties you go through on a career change. And 
when I came back from that, and I had been in a

21:20.601 --> 21:31.618
depressive kind of phase for, well, maybe a year 
and a half to that time, but, you know, functional.

21:31.638 --> 21:31.738
Yeah. Go to work and do all those things. Sure. I've 
done it. And when I came back from that, I had no

21:34.722 --> 21:38.869
energy left. That's just it. So I went on that 
basis. to Dr. Bernstein and kind of got him

21:43.422 --> 21:50.613
involved, come in and help me out, you know. So you 
were going about the summer of 80 to Dr. Bernstein?

21:54.379 --> 21:57.444
September of 81, this is. September of 81? Yeah, 
I'm sorry, I'm not sure. No problem. September of

22:01.351 --> 22:03.774
81, you started going to Dr. Bernstein? Mm-hmm. 
And how long before you could get Dennis into it?

22:08.836 --> 22:30.928
fairly soon after that a couple of two or three 
sessions as i recall well he didn't hang back and

22:08.836 --> 22:30.928
how did you respond then as to uh dr bernstein's 
probing. You said that it had a major impact, even

22:32.461 --> 22:38.189
though you didn't tell anybody. Yeah, it did. It 
seemed to have been amazing. I didn't really think

22:41.814 --> 22:48.302
much of these psychiatrists' methods, but I guess 
they do work. They do open up things, and of course

22:48.322 --> 22:52.828
they're quite painful. They break down these 
walls that you build up. But it's... It's hard to

22:59.157 --> 23:15.299
leave, but then you do manage

22:59.157 --> 23:15.299
to survive, and then probably are better for it, 
because you've broken down some walls, maybe, and

22:59.157 --> 23:15.299
that's, you now have a bigger room. Somehow that 
seems to make it work. About how long did you go?

23:24.592 --> 23:28.658
From September to February. No, September to 
about January. Once a week or so. Then Dennis

23:33.801 --> 23:37.433
stopped going. He didn't want to be changed. This 
now, you remind me, you said, you know, what caused

23:40.510 --> 23:51.089
the final kind of thing, and I had said something 
about I figured this was the end, there wasn't

23:40.510 --> 23:51.089
going to be any more change. He had told me in 
absolute terms, as far as I was hearing, that he

23:51.590 --> 24:01.648
would not go back to Dr. Bernstein anymore. He felt 
that he was perfectly alright and there was no

24:01.915 --> 24:12.162
reason, he wasn't going to be changed anymore.

24:13.188 --> 24:20.135
And I remember this one session I went into, Dr. 
Bernstein and I, you know, I was coming on my own.

24:20.775 --> 24:23.758
There was no more of this marital counseling. It 
was just going to be, which, you know, so I needed it

24:23.998 --> 24:28.002
anyway, but okay. It wasn't what I had in mind. And I 
remember Dr. Bernstein looking at his records and

24:29.544 --> 24:34.969
he said, well, let's see now. You have only on your 
medical plan, you have two more visits, something

24:35.690 --> 24:42.677
like that. I just thought, oh, And I finished the 
session and I'll go to the office. I'm never going

24:50.431 --> 24:54.197
to go back either. He was about, at that point, 
about the, I considered my last friend, if you

24:54.217 --> 25:14.547
will, the only one in the world I had left that would 
be concerned enough about me to, for any reason,

24:54.217 --> 25:14.547
and he's putting a price tag on it, which, I mean, in 
reality, of course, there is, but I don't need

24:54.217 --> 25:14.547
that. All the rest of this, I certainly can endow 
along with it, so I just wasn't going to go back. And

25:18.753 --> 25:19.915
then that's about within the next week or so came 
our final separation kind of scene and then as I

25:20.182 --> 25:31.086
mentioned to you then after that There's this 
relief, kind of all these, you know, floods of

25:31.606 --> 25:40.817
emotions, and kind of being able to come together 
on that. And then I went back one more time to tell

25:40.838 --> 25:51.571
Dr. Bernstein what had happened and what the story 
then was, and then that's the rest of it. So that was

25:51.711 --> 25:54.054
about January, February, March of... It was two 
years ago. I've been in 82. March of 82, we're there

25:57.238 --> 26:00.322
about March, April 82. Mm-hmm. In March 1982, tell 
me what the home, what your house looked like. You

26:08.300 --> 26:09.401
were living on the 12th floor. In the Hawaiian 
Princess. The Hawaiian Princess. It's a

26:13.805 --> 26:15.347
condominium complex? Condominium. Lahi Lahi 
Point. Lahi Lahi. Lahi Lahi Point, where Prince

26:18.850 --> 26:24.195
Makaha would dive off to meet his amakua, the 
shark. I see. I see. L-A-H-A, Lahi Lahi? Lahi Lahi.

26:28.879 --> 26:29.379
L-A-H-I. L-A-H-I. L-A-H-I. I see. And it was a 
beautiful home. I get the feeling of a balcony

26:34.766 --> 26:37.375
three-quarters of the way around the... It had a 
wraparound lanai, call it. Lanai? Lanai,

26:42.271 --> 26:45.100
L-A-N-A-I-N-A-I-N-A-I.

26:46.649 --> 26:49.393
And at that moment, you were still working for 
Mutual of New York? No, no. Oh. That was, I was

26:50.314 --> 26:55.701
working for Hawaii Refugee Resettlement Agency. 
Got it. It was the fairly new, fairly new executive

26:56.062 --> 27:00.227
at that time. How far from work were you? About 30 
miles out. And you had to go into downtown Hawaii?

27:06.956 --> 27:07.096
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And when did you take that job? How 
much earlier did you just take that job? In

27:11.047 --> 27:17.054
November of 81, so I'd only been working there for 
four months. How old was your brother? Sixteen.

27:20.577 --> 27:21.058
Twelve. Good, good. Can you think of anything 
since it is... Five minutes. Two minutes before

27:30.688 --> 27:32.530
two. I wanted to ask you if it would be at all helpful 
or... Any reason that you might want to talk to

27:38.506 --> 27:43.193
Cheryl or Mark about anything? Their 
recollections of anything? Well, my...

27:46.338 --> 27:52.067
Perhaps we can talk even later on. We don't have to 
do it at this moment. Because our memories, you

27:56.954 --> 27:59.077
know, sometimes... I'm curious what the kids 
thought of Dennis, and I'm curious whether they

27:59.097 --> 28:06.268
saw in him survival techniques that they should 
have benefited by or that seemed odd to them in the

28:06.788 --> 28:12.497
United States? Well, they perfectly are. I'm sure 
they'd be delighted to talk about it. That's nice.

28:20.751 --> 28:22.153
And the book is going on? Yes. Good. I know you 
mentioned Cheryl had not only a bad time with her

28:23.107 --> 28:26.533
health. How is her health ultimately? She seems 
fine now. She had the two year, supposed to be

28:29.418 --> 28:35.568
checked every six months for two years. She passed 
her two years exam.

28:40.100 --> 28:46.634
But then in June, it's now a half year later, two and 
a half years later, she said no sign of recurrence.

28:46.715 --> 28:50.342
But the ugly part about melanoma is that it could be 
years. Well, we're all in the same boat. No one

28:53.369 --> 28:55.634
knows whether we're not going to fall down 
outside. You know, life goes on as usual, and she's

28:55.654 --> 29:00.184
very healthy. all the problems are going to be 
taken care of eventually. It could happen in a

29:03.470 --> 29:05.554
traffic accident. And so there was always the 
chance that I didn't have to make any decision. The

29:11.245 --> 29:12.327
confrontation would never come. Yes, you could 
just keep putting the confrontation off until the

29:12.347 --> 29:19.039
guy with the scythe comes across. And Cheryl... 
You said also had a difficult emotional time

29:20.549 --> 29:24.194
trying to commit suicide? Well, she didn't know 
over to act, but it got, she threatened it. Oh, I

29:28.401 --> 29:29.162
see. When we were going off on our, going off to get 
married, just, you know, lip service. Okay, okay.

29:34.550 --> 29:35.892
I thought it was something much more serious. They 
always thought, including Jean, that I was the

29:35.912 --> 29:42.962
perfect, perfect mate for Jean because She's a 
very, I don't know what the terminology is, but

29:43.634 --> 29:59.263
with her, what you might call wild ideas of running 
and moving and dropping out and going out in the

29:43.634 --> 29:59.263
blaze and not really meaning any of this. But I 
don't know. Nobody knows for sure. But it's

30:03.129 --> 30:05.733
constantly being threatened, you know. And all 
the vendettas would just stand there and sip this

30:05.854 --> 30:11.022
martini and smile, you see. And they said, you 
know, there's like an anchor. You know, here are

30:14.327 --> 30:16.611
these people all going to shoot up. You know what 
Cheryl said to us? When we left the other day,

30:19.656 --> 30:22.480
Cheryl was sitting down. She said, Mom, you 
know... I'm really feeling kind of a struggle now.

30:27.027 --> 30:29.030
I'm feeling this sort of role reversal. Should you 
always think that your parents are going to be some

30:29.130 --> 30:33.016
kind of stability? And I never was, and now I'm the 
only stable one. She says, I have a home and a family

30:36.241 --> 30:39.786
here, and I'm really trying hard to get my head 
together. And she said, I just wish I had,

30:39.806 --> 30:44.974
sometimes I wish I had normal parents. And then she 
looked kind of chagrined.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.964
Let me ask you about the period when you were 
drinking a lot. Is it brought about by these same

30:52.822 --> 30:58.419
problems, or just boredom, or it's not important? 
Oh, well, when we live in California, we're just

30:58.439 --> 31:03.715
like the affluent society. Everybody had their 
martinis, and after a while, I had Actually, gin

31:07.773 --> 31:11.058
makes me a little ill. So then we switched to vodka. 
Our friends had martinis. As you get older, then

31:13.742 --> 31:17.107
everybody's kind of... We got together, 
everybody. Martinis, steaks, and salads was the

31:18.208 --> 31:23.076
thing. And fortunately, neither one of us can 
drink after we eat. So it's all over with by 8

31:27.402 --> 31:30.407
o'clock. You know, you have a couple of cocktails 
before dinner. We enjoy wine. And then that's it.

31:37.342 --> 31:44.029
But it's, you know, when I say a lot, every night is a 
lot, if you don't hear that. But as far as having

31:44.289 --> 31:47.512
a... I should kind of briefly mention that name, 
Alice McIntyre. Oh, she stood up for us at our

31:52.877 --> 31:54.298
wedding. She stood up for us at the wedding, and she 
was one of the really brightest women I have ever

31:54.318 --> 32:03.126
had the pleasure of being with. She was the office 
manager for Clark Door Company, an absolute

32:03.494 --> 32:16.011
savior as a backup for my work. She would 
straighten out all the billing and all the

32:16.031 --> 32:22.920
complaints while I was out on the road. So 
influential

32:23.221 --> 32:42.968
is what you're saying?

32:42.948 --> 33:07.285
just incredible i haven't had one since like that 
but the drinking was not uh a period we'd get

32:42.948 --> 33:07.285
together with them it was it was never to the point 
that we were ever not functioning right or that it

32:42.948 --> 33:07.285
became evidently of some concern but not nothing 
um a concern as we got older from a health

32:42.948 --> 33:07.285
standpoint yeah you start reading you know gee 
maybe we shouldn't drink this actually it

32:42.948 --> 33:07.285
diminishes or it Your mineral supply gets 
diminished. All these kinds of things. Sex drive

33:10.019 --> 33:11.821
hasn't helped a lot either. Well, I'm sure that's

33:11.841 --> 33:20.393
understandable. How do you see Dennis? If you were 
telling a close girlfriend, and it doesn't have to

33:26.522 --> 33:29.526
be honest, You're going to see all these things 
before they ever get to the point where... I'm not

33:33.297 --> 33:34.319
worried about that. I mean, I'm either going to be 
upfront about it or I'm not going to say it at all.

33:40.532 --> 33:41.293
How do you see Dennis? If you were describing 
Dennis to a close girlfriend or to your mother, if

33:41.333 --> 33:46.924
you would... very close, you would say? My very 
first and foremost reaction is I have always

33:50.877 --> 33:56.125
considered him a very substantial person. That's 
extremely important to me, is a feeling of

33:56.145 --> 34:06.162
substance about somebody I can really get a big arm 
for. He's really... Despite the fact that you feel

34:08.886 --> 34:12.492
that you took over a lot of responsibility? 
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. the part that made me angry was not

34:15.220 --> 34:25.787
that he, I didn't think he couldn't do it, that he 
didn't have the mental capacity or the

34:15.220 --> 34:25.787
imagination, whatever, but he wouldn't do it for I 
could never come to terms with the reasons, the

34:26.763 --> 34:47.691
discrepancy between, I think I mentioned that 
earlier, his aggressiveness in many, many other

34:26.763 --> 34:47.691
arenas, like sports, for example, to see him come 
down the face of Squaw Peak and all these kind of

34:26.763 --> 34:47.691
things, and yet this hanging back and, you know, 
like... More pablum, more pablum, in so many other

34:47.671 --> 34:52.118
areas. And, of course, by contrast, which I would 
need to bring out, my own father, who was not this

34:52.258 --> 35:11.367
stature, but who was such a substantial type 
person in terms of the taking care part of his

34:52.258 --> 35:11.367
family, And my mother is blithering. And my dad 
would always put down the dollar bills on the table

35:17.114 --> 35:24.800
every day for the food and tell her this, and you're 
going to do this, and this, and this. And the life

35:24.820 --> 35:26.622
was like all laid out. And so the confusion then for 
me of seeing Dennis be so aggressive in many, many

35:27.483 --> 35:40.594
other areas, but not everything that kind of 
happened. Which now I can... You know, putting

35:42.582 --> 35:49.112
pieces together diminishes much of the anger. Oh, 
yes, I'll bet it will. Have you

35:51.356 --> 35:58.787
anything to ask? I'm sure I'll think of something 
between now and the next.
