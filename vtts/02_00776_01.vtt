00:02.900 --> 00:09.716
This is Deborah Beale interviewing Mr. Don Feltz 
on the history of the Texas Engineering

00:02.900 --> 00:09.716
Experiment Station. The date is June 14, 1984.

00:37.409 --> 00:40.413
Okay, that looks like that is working now. Okay, 
now how you came to A&M? Okay, your question was how

00:43.137 --> 00:46.041
did I get associated with A&M. Okay, I was first a 
student here in 1951, and stayed here two years

00:46.842 --> 01:01.422
until I was drafted into the Army because of the 
Korean War, and then I did not get back to A&M until

00:46.842 --> 01:01.422
1957. I continued my studies toward a degree in 
mechanical engineering. And then that was

01:08.392 --> 01:15.701
followed by my immediate entry into graduate 
school as a nuclear engineer. At the time I

01:16.883 --> 01:27.155
graduated in mechanical engineering, the 
nuclear engineering department had actually not

01:16.883 --> 01:27.155
been founded. We were taking nuclear engineering 
courses, but they were being offered through the

01:27.316 --> 01:34.344
Department of Mechanical Engineering. And 
shortly thereafter, I'd say in 1960 or so, they

01:38.176 --> 01:43.364
formed the Nuclear Engineering Department. And 
that's when they brought Dr. Cochran here, not

01:44.506 --> 01:57.325
only to head up nuclear engineering, but also to be 
head of the Nuclear Science Center, which at that

01:44.506 --> 01:57.325
time was in its design phase.

02:01.531 --> 02:07.440
The studies and proposals for funding from the 
National Science Foundation the Department of

02:08.483 --> 02:17.892
Energy had all been completed and the design work 
started on the Science Center in 59. About the time

02:18.152 --> 02:24.218
I was finishing up my undergraduate work in 
mechanical engineering. So, shortly after I got

02:24.238 --> 02:36.550
into the nuclear engineering course work, I took 
an assistantship where I was assigned to the

02:24.238 --> 02:36.550
Nuclear Science Center We were housed on campus in 
the old highway research building, which is

02:37.492 --> 02:50.429
across the street from the, uh, petroleum 
engineering, the, uh, Girardi building. And we

02:50.449 --> 03:00.803
were, at that time, when I joined the science 
center, they'd already started excavation, all

02:50.449 --> 03:00.803
the construction. So I continued, uh, with my 
graduate studies, working as a half-time

03:04.643 --> 03:11.552
research assistant, or student assistant. 
Proper term, I guess, is graduate assistant. Get

03:15.376 --> 03:16.037
it right in a minute. And I stayed in that capacity 
until 1963, when I completed my studies. And then I

03:26.030 --> 03:31.697
became full-time employed at the Science Center 
as reactor supervisor. And two years after that,

03:33.010 --> 03:41.280
the administration changed at the Science 
Center. Dr. Cochran

03:41.300 --> 04:00.705
was

03:41.300 --> 04:00.705
put back, say, only in charge of the engineering 
department, and they brought a director to the

03:41.300 --> 04:00.705
Science Center, changed the title from head to 
director, and that was Dr. John Randall. And I was

04:01.715 --> 04:05.359
named the assistant at that time, in 1965. So I've 
had just about all the jobs that are available out

04:06.801 --> 04:13.509
here since that time. And then later, I was named 
the associate director to the center.

04:23.700 --> 04:28.566
When you first started studying nuclear science,

04:29.221 --> 04:33.685
Were you pretty sure they were going to get the 
funding and everything to establish the center?

04:35.327 --> 04:35.707
Oh, yes. Yeah, we had the funding in hand when I 
started. That work was done by, mainly by Dr. Dick

04:41.192 --> 04:48.660
Winerdi, Rich Winerdi, and Dr. Calhoun. They were 
responsible for putting the package together,

04:49.641 --> 04:56.427
the proposals, to get the funding for the center. 
There were several things at that time that the

04:58.128 --> 05:06.356
university wanted to get into for the advancement 
of engineering and science. One was a data

05:07.677 --> 05:09.099
processing center. One was a nuclear science 
center, which both became reality. These were all

05:16.066 --> 05:23.172
in the era of Dr. Calhoun and Dean Benson and Dr. 
Wernherde. At the time, Dr. Wernherde was His

05:26.596 --> 05:41.417
responsibility was gathering the information 
for the proposals and getting something started

05:26.596 --> 05:41.417
in the nuclear engineering as far as the reactor 
was concerned, too. Of course, we were placed from

05:41.437 --> 05:46.284
the very beginning under the Tees. As far as Tees 
administration, I remember only Dean Benson. The

05:55.655 --> 06:06.571
previous director, I did not know that well, but 
there was a little crossover there, I think, when I

05:55.655 --> 06:06.571
was one of the graduate assistants. I think my 
first Form 500 was actually signed by Dr. Rose. So,

06:12.680 --> 06:24.818
if I'm not making an error, I think Dean Benson must 
have taken the directorship of Tees about that

06:12.680 --> 06:24.818
time. So I was pretty close there because I did 
start in 59. So you have to obviously mention Dr.

06:33.584 --> 06:41.814
Rose as far as the development of the nuclear 
science center. Because it actually started, it

06:41.834 --> 06:47.460
was a deputy under study while he was still 
director of the team. Do you know who instigated

06:47.480 --> 06:53.387
the whole idea of the nuclear science center? I 
would think it would be Dr. Calhoun from

06:54.278 --> 07:01.524
discussions with him since that time. I think it 
was his idea to bring Dr. Wernherdi to Texas A&M

07:01.544 --> 07:16.437
with the specific assignment to put together the 
proposal to get the funding for this center. Now

07:18.439 --> 07:20.440
there was a mini reactor or something before. Yes, 
at the time. I started my studies in nuclear

07:23.793 --> 07:25.837
engineering. There was a small reactor placed in 
the mechanical engineering shops. It was called

07:32.188 --> 07:48.417
an AGN 201 reactor, and Dr. Randall, who was not a 
doctor at the time, but John Randall, came to Texas

07:32.188 --> 07:48.417
A&M in perhaps 59, late 58, to put that reactor in. 
It's a training reactor. It's still here at Texas

07:50.297 --> 07:51.498
A&M. It's located now in the basement of Zachary. 
It's associated with the Department of Nuclear

07:56.004 --> 08:01.191
Engineering. It's a very low-power reactor used 
in training, training for engineering students

08:01.211 --> 08:09.701
or reactor operators. It does have some research 
capabilities, but they're quite limited because

08:10.703 --> 08:17.391
of the what we consider the low power of the 
reactor. It's the type of machine that if the

08:21.424 --> 08:30.153
operator makes an error, it shuts down very 
quickly. He must maintain the instruments within

08:30.173 --> 08:39.422
full range of the capability of each instrument. 
If he goes off scale, either on the high end or off

08:39.442 --> 08:45.428
the bottom end of the scale, he's going to lose the 
reactor. It's going to shut down on him. So he has to

08:48.387 --> 08:52.213
be very careful to make sure the instruments stay 
on the proper scales. And there's one reason it's

08:53.255 --> 08:56.580
called training reactor. You're spending a lot of 
time paying attention to the controls. Now that

09:03.410 --> 09:09.820
was moved, by the way, when Zachary was built. They 
moved the reactor from the shops into the Zachary

09:10.722 --> 09:16.791
Center, the engineering center. It's now 
associated with the Department of Nuclear

09:17.665 --> 09:24.696
Engineering complex they have there. It's on a 
different level than the classrooms.

09:32.067 --> 09:40.479
There's a large laboratory associated above the 
reactor as well as you can work around the reactor

09:32.067 --> 09:40.479
itself.

09:43.123 --> 09:46.288
It's quite large in size as far as the facility 
compared to the space we had over in the ME shops. We

09:51.383 --> 09:58.450
were just more or less placed in the corner of that 
large building and then a separate little

09:51.383 --> 09:58.450
building was built around it.

10:02.334 --> 10:08.900
They were doing mostly biological radiation 
studies? Not with that reactor, no. That reactor

10:12.023 --> 10:16.427
was used mainly in the class instruction lab work 
for nuclear engineering students. When did TWU

10:21.138 --> 10:27.366
have Grant come to use it for bone research or 
something? The 201? I'm not familiar with that.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.173
That must not have happened when I was there. Maybe 
later. When did they, I've seen pictures of the,

10:34.235 --> 10:42.707
all the rat research and the exposure of the rats. 
Was that once the complex was created? Well, the

10:47.356 --> 10:54.065
exposure of those animals, I can recall two ways 
they were done. Dr. Sidney Brown and Dr. Christ of

10:55.347 --> 11:03.759
biology, radiation biology. They had a Cobalt 60 
facility on campus, a very small source that I

11:03.779 --> 11:17.278
remember as a graduate assistant, we had to 
sometimes go over and do maintenance to that

11:03.779 --> 11:17.278
facility. And they had a few animals in cages 
there. But that was in one of the old army-type

11:23.252 --> 11:29.620
buildings, barracks buildings, yeah. Is that 
what you remember seeing? Yeah, that's the type of

11:31.062 --> 11:32.544
building. It didn't look like one of the new 
buildings. Building F or something over by what

11:34.207 --> 11:41.897
was back behind the Indian Press at that time. And 
they tore most of those buildings down. I still see

11:44.000 --> 11:45.262
one over there. Did they bring most of that 
research out here or something? once we yes

11:48.275 --> 12:17.168
because we added to this center a special facility 
for the radiation of animals it's not part of the

11:48.275 --> 12:17.168
reactor building it's it's a separate building 
that was built on our site and it housed a very large

11:48.275 --> 12:17.168
cobalt 60 source and you could when you raise the 
source for exposure there was a large field with a

11:48.275 --> 12:17.168
dirt mound to catch the radiation you're not 
using, the stray radiation. And you could place

12:21.859 --> 12:27.284
small houses of animals out on the field. And you 
can place them at varying distances from the

12:28.265 --> 12:34.311
source and irradiate them. And we operated that 
source for many years. No, the source has been

12:38.416 --> 12:41.399
dismantled. The building is still there and the 
shield is still there. When was it dismantled?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.745
That's a good question.

12:49.818 --> 12:51.300
Early 70s. When was it first opened? In, I'd say, 
60...

12:53.363 --> 13:00.194
Well, okay, it opened very close to the time we 
opened. I'd say 63, 64. It was planned very early as

13:01.556 --> 13:17.260
part of the Science Center to have a nuclear 
reactor source, which is basically a neutron

13:01.556 --> 13:17.260
source, and then to have the separate gamma 
facility. for life science studies. The research

13:20.557 --> 13:27.523
that was done in cooperation with MD Anderson, was 
that done here or in Houston? Well, we've done

13:27.543 --> 13:32.888
quite a bit of work for MD Anderson and still do. Are 
you talking about the gold seeds? I haven't been

13:35.229 --> 13:43.316
able to really understand exactly what kind, but I 
knew there was radiation research. Oh yes, the MD

13:43.797 --> 13:47.820
Anderson Tumor Institute. He's done a lot of 
research at A&M, both at this reactor facility and

13:48.678 --> 13:59.748
also the psychotropic. We have not been involved 
with any where the patients come to us for any

13:59.768 --> 14:08.817
treatment, any radiation treatment. What we're 
producing here are isotopes that are implanted in

14:09.357 --> 14:16.764
cancerous tumors. We produce the basic 
radioactive material they use, which is gold.

14:23.688 --> 14:32.560
It's a little tiny gold seed about the diameter of a 
pencil lid, thin line pencil lid, roughly a tenth

14:23.688 --> 14:32.560
of an inch in length. And it's platinum coated so 
that it can be made surgically clean. And then we

14:39.230 --> 14:43.035
produce the radioactivity in the little seed. And 
we produce the quantity of activity they desire at

14:49.715 --> 14:55.282
a certain time on a certain day for implant in the 
patient. And we have to make obviously more

14:56.263 --> 15:19.030
radioactivity than is needed because there's two 
or three days in between for handling of the

14:56.263 --> 15:19.030
material to get it shipped back down to Houston and 
get it through their laboratory because they will

14:56.263 --> 15:19.030
assay it for its strength to make sure that it's the 
proper strength at the time of surgery. And we've

15:19.972 --> 15:25.538
been doing that for many years, still doing it. Was 
that process developed here? In the early stages

15:29.322 --> 15:35.368
of that experimental work, it wasn't indeed an 
experiment. It was experimental all the way, and

15:35.388 --> 15:41.114
the patients, we were told, were terminal. And of 
course, we never got involved with that end of it.

15:46.060 --> 15:49.303
But now, this is standard therapy. But that 
therapy was developed here? Yes, as a result of the

15:52.173 --> 15:54.855
work we did. Of course, now when we speak with Dr. 
Calhoun, maybe this is where you heard that story.

16:03.184 --> 16:18.700
He was one of the founding fathers of this 
facility, and then what, 20 years later or

16:03.184 --> 16:18.700
whatever, 22, 20-so years later, he actually 
benefited from the implants of the gold we make.

16:24.021 --> 16:30.411
He's had these implants for treatment of cancer. 
Do you plan to interview Dr. Kemp? I plan to, yes.

16:35.278 --> 16:36.340
Well, he's a must. He's a must in your interview 
because he will tie together all these dates we're

16:38.102 --> 16:50.020
talking about on the Science Center and the 
involvement of Dr. Wernherg. After Dr.

16:50.405 --> 17:08.285
Mornerdi's initial involvement in the proposal 
gathering, and the fund gathering rather, he then

16:50.405 --> 17:08.285
became a primary researcher here at the facility. 
He developed the Activation Analysis Research

17:09.747 --> 17:18.056
Laboratory, called AARL as we knew it in those 
days. That's been shut down. Well, it's been

17:20.105 --> 17:21.487
transferred. The function has and renamed. It's 
now the center trace characterization. It's part

17:26.655 --> 17:28.698
of that center. But it's still neutron activation 
analysis. There was a lot of activity there. They

17:35.949 --> 17:39.574
were one of our mainstays in the early years here. 
Their laboratory was part of our facility. They

17:43.840 --> 17:46.905
occupied a very large facility. space in the 
reactor, upper research level as we call it, where

17:47.594 --> 17:55.184
their equipment was very close to the reactor. And 
we've since improved the method of delivering

17:56.326 --> 18:04.337
samples using high pressure gas. We call them 
pneumatic systems. And that lab was later removed

18:06.720 --> 18:14.090
from that area adjacent to the reactor. And when we 
built this new lab addition right in here, We sent

18:17.497 --> 18:20.701
the samples much longer distances. And the Center 
for Trace Characterization still have a lab here,

18:20.721 --> 18:26.728
always have had. That's an activity that we've 
never been without, either under the name of

18:27.549 --> 18:36.119
Activation Analysis Research Lab or CTC. Do you 
know when that center started? Oh, the AARL? No,

18:40.363 --> 18:42.406
the Center for... Oh, that? No. It

18:44.800 --> 19:08.968
was set up to collect the activities of various 
groups, put them under one collection, one

18:44.800 --> 19:08.968
directionship, and that's now being done under 
the Department of Chemistry. in the College of

19:09.623 --> 19:11.465
Science. And Dr. Swiker is the director of that 
center. Which were a very vital and essential

19:17.373 --> 19:25.124
facility to that research. Because they have to 
have the reactor to get the neutrons to do that

19:26.265 --> 19:32.834
work. Besides the activation analysis, what was 
going on at the Well, in the early days, we were

19:37.433 --> 19:42.460
producing isotopes. There's always been an 
interest in the Houston area. First in just

19:51.133 --> 19:53.697
isotope production. These would be basically 
commercial users.

20:00.947 --> 20:06.175
The petrochemical companies have always shown 
interest in the reactor. And then we have the

20:06.695 --> 20:15.825
isotope suppliers that are supplying the 
hospitals and industry in the Southwest on the

20:06.695 --> 20:15.825
commercial side. We've been working with those 
users out of Houston. But our main thrust in those

20:20.089 --> 20:36.246
days was working, of course, with the university, 
developing programs in the various departments,

20:20.089 --> 20:36.246
biochemistry, chemistry, life sciences, animal 
science. Some of our early experimenters, for

20:37.238 --> 20:44.369
example, was Dr. Deeker, still with A&M. Maybe a 
person you'd like to interview because I would say

20:46.312 --> 20:54.264
he was part of the history of this science center. 
He was around when we started and one of our earlier

20:55.506 --> 21:01.014
experimenters. He ran a project here for many 
years. looking at the uptake of minerals in

21:03.968 --> 21:07.072
peanuts. We would irradiate his peanut samples. 
He would analyze those samples for the minerals

21:14.682 --> 21:19.367
that were present. He was developing nutritional 
plant foods, I'd say, for the peanuts. Also, he was

21:27.678 --> 21:31.663
trying to determine the processes by which this 
plant was actually picking up the minerals. It led

21:37.149 --> 21:43.796
to better fertilizers and also higher production 
yields in the plant cycle.

21:46.119 --> 21:50.243
All this being traced using radioactive 
materials. Again, it's what we call the neutron

21:50.263 --> 21:53.427
activation analysis.

21:56.490 --> 22:00.975
Neutron activation analysis is a very important 
part of of nuclear reactor research, the users of

22:02.407 --> 22:06.674
these facilities. Even the small reactors, you 
can provide this service. The little 201, for

22:11.862 --> 22:25.744
example, on campus, you could do a small amount of 
what we call the NAA on it, simply because neutrons

22:11.862 --> 22:25.744
are present. Neutrons, when they enter a 
substance, They interreact with the nuclei and in

22:30.250 --> 22:37.100
that process the radioactivity is produced. Each 
element that's present becomes radioactive. And

22:41.907 --> 22:50.018
then it's up to the scientist to have the technique 
and the skills to identify what he's made

22:41.907 --> 22:50.018
radioactive. In doing so he can quantify what's in 
the sample. That's really all we do. As well as If he

23:00.845 --> 23:17.261
runs standards of known weights, known masses, he 
can then compare the unknown sample to a known

23:00.845 --> 23:17.261
sample and then determine the quantity of the 
material that's present. So it's a full analysis

23:17.281 --> 23:21.385
of the sample. You can do this by chemistry as well, 
but there are some big advantages in many cases by

23:26.917 --> 23:34.567
doing it with neutron, the neutron method rather 
than the chemical method. Very good explanation.

23:36.309 --> 23:39.794
Something I hadn't been able to figure out from the 
technical publications. They assume you know

23:39.954 --> 23:41.636
what it is. That's what it is. And then the other 
work we got into in the early days was to work with

23:42.778 --> 23:55.995
our beam ports, which are penetrations through 
the reactor shield structure They're much like

23:56.819 --> 24:00.323
large telescopes, the way they're fabricated 
there. They start near the reactor with a small

24:00.843 --> 24:19.622
diameter pipe, and then as you work your way 
through the shield structure, these sections of

24:00.843 --> 24:19.622
pipes get larger, which allows you to place 
shielding material in the pipes and leave, say, a

24:00.843 --> 24:19.622
tiny hole through the center. If you line the hole 
up all the way through the port, you will get a beam

24:24.325 --> 24:52.915
of radiation coming down the hole and you can shape 
that beam have it large or you can have it very small

24:24.325 --> 24:52.915
you can place materials in the beam and if you don't 
want to look at what would be coming directly off

24:24.325 --> 24:52.915
the reactor you can do what we call secondary 
reactions

24:24.325 --> 24:52.915
allow the neutrons to interact with the target and 
then you indeed then look at that target through

24:53.738 --> 24:57.883
the beam. Let whatever the secondary reactions 
are come down the beam. And in the 60s and the years

25:02.349 --> 25:16.828
prior to that, 40s, 50s, there was a lot of particle 
physics

25:02.349 --> 25:16.828
going on. These studies were being conducted at 
research reactors.

25:23.843 --> 25:27.346
Of course, the cyclotron or accelerators came 
into being. That gave the scientists another tool

25:28.167 --> 25:31.550
to work with. Again, you're involved with 
radioactivity when you work with a cyclotron or an

25:32.851 --> 25:38.577
accelerator. It's a different machine entirely 
than a nuclear reactor. The scientist uses it for a

25:43.902 --> 25:46.464
different reason. But our beam port work became 
quite extensive. mid-60s all the way up through

25:54.590 --> 25:56.732
early 70s. And then it seemed like so much of this 
work was being done all over the world and in the

25:59.135 --> 26:16.955
national laboratories, mainly here in the United 
States, that it seemed like they reached a point

25:59.135 --> 26:16.955
where they figured they'd studied most of the 
major things. And the interest in particle

26:17.695 --> 26:24.563
physics using a reactor kind of died away. And it 
wasn't until a few years later that other uses were

26:26.298 --> 26:34.729
found for extracting beams. Neutron 
radiography, for example, is a very popular

26:36.732 --> 26:55.377
common method now for use of a neutron beam to image 
an object by measuring the transmission of

26:36.732 --> 26:55.377
neutrons through that object. and obtaining the 
image on the film, much like an x-ray would be done,

26:56.386 --> 27:15.148
except the nuclear particle you're dealing with 
is much different, and it interreacts with matter

26:56.386 --> 27:15.148
in a much different way than the x-ray would.

27:15.168 --> 27:24.739
Research reactors of, say, our size, definitely 
are good tools for neutron radioactivity. We have

27:27.166 --> 27:29.609
such a facility now. These are good facilities for 
measuring

27:31.071 --> 27:49.693
defects in materials, metal castings, looking at 
plastic laminates that have been bonded by

27:31.071 --> 27:49.693
special glues or bonding agents. And if the 
bonding agents contain moisture, then the

27:49.713 --> 27:57.122
bonding is probably going to fail. So you can look 
at these materials and determine if you have a good

27:57.693 --> 28:01.558
bond. And it's very, very good for looking at 
plastic explosives. Small detonator devices

28:08.326 --> 28:15.134
like you would find in the ejector seats of 
military aircraft. Also there's a lot of small

28:15.475 --> 28:24.926
explosives in the control systems of some 
aircraft. They're computer controlled And if you

28:27.443 --> 28:38.257
can't control the computer, if it goes completely 
on the whack, well, sometimes they will release

28:27.443 --> 28:38.257
control by explosive methods. Just release the 
control wire by a small explosion.

28:45.367 --> 28:46.729
We do that type of work. We do some of that for NASA 
and their missile program. And then Bell

28:53.378 --> 28:56.742
Helicopter, looking at some of the blades. Not the 
final product, but the laboratory development

28:57.903 --> 29:05.631
research area in their blade work. Because 
they're trying to make helicopter blades as light

29:06.211 --> 29:09.955
as they possibly can. The plastics offer a much 
lighter blade. And as I understand, an actually

29:16.121 --> 29:19.965
stronger blade. When you can put it together by 
gluing it in a series of layers. Put it together. So

29:26.641 --> 29:35.133
the beam port work, we had involvement of the 
nuclear physicist, the nuclear engineer.

29:36.254 --> 29:39.899
They're the types that would be looking at 
particle reactions.

29:43.865 --> 29:54.960
These were all titled either something like 
Resonance Fluorescence Studies,

29:43.865 --> 29:54.960
which is excitation of energy levels in 
materials. and neutron diffraction. These were

29:58.535 --> 30:03.680
all kind of carryovers of what was going on in the 
national laboratories.

30:06.883 --> 30:17.074
When all this nuclear business began, 
particularly for peaceful uses, we needed to know

30:06.883 --> 30:17.074
quite a bit of information about our isotopes. 
What are their half-lives? What are the gamma ray

30:19.416 --> 30:23.901
energies that come off of these materials? once 
they're made radioactive? How many identifiable

30:27.475 --> 30:31.540
isotopes do you have for each element? How do they 
naturally occur in nature? And so forth and so on.

30:38.427 --> 30:45.975
So there's quite a bit of work being done in the 40s 
and 50s in the development of what we call the chart

30:38.427 --> 30:45.975
of the nuclei.

30:49.179 --> 30:52.082
Texas A&M was not heavily involved in that. But it 
led to the type of people that came to A&M. You would

30:57.888 --> 31:07.436
find professors that were working in these labs, 
the national laboratories, that would come to A&M

30:57.888 --> 31:07.436
to join the staff, the faculty. And in fact, 
there's still some of those individuals here. Dr.

31:12.981 --> 31:17.265
John McIntyre works with cyclotron. He was an 
extensive researcher here in particle physics

31:17.685 --> 31:23.250
studies. using our beam ports. And he had nuclear 
engineering students studying under him,

31:26.912 --> 31:34.799
physics students.

31:34.819 --> 31:35.540
Quite interesting. He's now with Cyclotron. What 
is their connection at all between Cyclotron and

31:38.723 --> 31:42.186
the university? There's no administrative 
connection, nor is there a connection as far as

31:42.206 --> 31:52.495
changing their customers or users, say. They're 
completely different machines used for

31:53.335 --> 31:58.704
different purposes. Now you can, you will 
probably find a researcher that may be interested

31:58.724 --> 32:05.115
in using both. That happens. His experiment may be 
such that he can do particular things at each place

32:07.078 --> 32:18.077
and that may be a possible requirement.

32:18.580 --> 32:31.193
Yeah,

32:18.580 --> 32:31.193
we use the fission process, which is of course the 
first development. Fusion development, we do not

32:32.355 --> 32:38.902
become involved in fusion because it's right now 
experimental. It's in the development stage. But

32:42.425 --> 32:46.950
the large power reactors, hopefully one day will 
be fusion.

32:52.625 --> 33:02.558
If you have a cleaner system with byproducts, the 
problems there go way down with fusion. We have an

33:02.578 --> 33:05.282
infinite supply of energy. That's the source for 
fusion. It's infinite. The heavy waters, the

33:11.110 --> 33:15.756
hydrogen, there's plenty of that.

33:17.457 --> 33:30.693
It would be nice to achieve fusion, but the problem 
with it is the temperatures are so high in the

33:17.457 --> 33:30.693
reactive process that there's nothing man-made 
that will hold those temperatures. So you have to

33:30.893 --> 33:39.424
do it in a very sophisticated electromagnetic

33:30.893 --> 33:39.424
field. And the magnetic fields are very difficult 
to shape just perfectly. to hold what we call the

33:48.035 --> 33:50.238
plasma. And it breaks down, and it doesn't last 
very long. That's the achievements of, of course,

33:56.105 --> 34:02.113
producing fusion. We know that because we've seen 
fusion in our weapons. But the peaceful use of it,

34:08.521 --> 34:17.012
developing it like we were able to get into the 
peaceful uses of our reactors using fission, It's

34:17.937 --> 34:21.120
a much more difficult problem. It's going to take 
many years to get there. Does A&M plan on getting

34:24.924 --> 34:27.886
involved in the development? A&M has had some 
involvement. It's been on a small scale, either in

34:31.330 --> 34:45.683
the individual interest in the physics 
department in that area or individual interest,

34:31.330 --> 34:45.683
say, in the nuclear engineering aspect of it. as 
well as the electrical engineer. He enters into

34:49.574 --> 34:51.356
this picture too. Most of it is being, I'd say, 
developed by the physicist. Once the physicist

34:57.883 --> 35:09.974
has his theories all laid out and then he needs the 
engineer to come in and put it, have him put it

34:57.883 --> 35:09.974
together and get something that's functional. 
That's where they are now. They're, the two groups

35:13.097 --> 35:17.762
are working together, or the two disciplines are 
working together hopefully achieve a continuous

35:18.333 --> 35:28.204
fusion reaction and produce

35:18.333 --> 35:28.204
energy. From what I understand, I want to make a 
statement. You tell me if I'm right or wrong. The

35:33.529 --> 35:46.163
nuclear reactivant here is used more as a tool for 
the study of the effects or a tool in the study of

35:33.529 --> 35:46.163
something else using radiation. rather than 
doing nuclear science research? We do two things.

35:52.603 --> 35:58.010
The majority of our work is we produce radioactive 
materials. We take a material that is not

35:58.070 --> 36:08.223
radioactive and we introduce it to the reactor, to 
the neutrons that are present, and then we then

35:58.070 --> 36:08.223
have a radioactive material. And you sell it? We 
don't sell it. We're just providing it to the

36:10.786 --> 36:13.630
experimenter. We're a service facility. No, 
we're not out saying that we've got all these

36:16.147 --> 36:21.793
materials on the shelf and you can buy them. It's 
not that at all. We are here to serve the

36:23.235 --> 36:24.997
experimenter. And he will contact us. And in many 
cases, he has an idea. That's all it is. He isn't

36:33.947 --> 36:36.089
familiar with working with radiation. But in 
reading material, he's questioned if he could do a

36:37.190 --> 36:44.398
certain project using a radioactive material, 
maybe a tracer. Quite simply, describing a tracer

36:51.137 --> 37:08.282
would be the work being done in the animal science 
area by Dr. Ellis, where he's studying the

36:51.137 --> 37:08.282
digestive tract and also other things related to 
that in cattle. He extracts samples from the

37:10.345 --> 37:13.710
animal's stomach or multiple stomachs as they 
have. And he will actually be tracing a material as

37:18.380 --> 37:27.532
it passes through the digestive tract of the 
animal. And he will determine the use of that

37:28.634 --> 37:36.724
material by the animal in its nutritional uptake. 
And he's doing that by not feeding the animal

37:37.705 --> 37:43.613
anything that's radioactive. But he's putting a 
material in there that the reactor will make

37:44.285 --> 37:55.936
radioactive very easily and easily 
identifiable. He puts a rare earth in there that is

37:55.956 --> 38:00.820
not commonly occurring. It's something foreign 
to the animal. You wouldn't see it in any other

38:04.944 --> 38:10.189
animal except the one that he's given that special 
feed to. And then as he extracts the samples, we

38:11.130 --> 38:13.752
activate. that material in the reactor. He then 
will count the sample and he can identify the

38:15.526 --> 38:26.917
uptake or how much is being moved through the 
animal. That's called the tracer method. Another

38:29.580 --> 38:34.765
common tracer radioactive-wise is the medical 
application. Tracing of iodine to the thyroid for

38:37.127 --> 38:43.333
a scan.

38:44.073 --> 38:53.823
It's gotten to the point now where almost any of us 
that go to a doctor, we're gonna become involved

38:44.073 --> 38:53.823
with some radioactivity. Either x-ray or they're 
gonna do a scan maybe. Study the digestive tract.

39:04.695 --> 39:10.040
The heart, they can take brain scans, thyroid 
scans. Technetium is a very good isotope. for

39:14.735 --> 39:17.357
human diagnostic work. We make technetium here 
for the medical applications. So the reason all

39:24.444 --> 39:41.340
this works is this material that is not 
radioactive, you place it in the reactor, it comes

39:24.444 --> 39:41.340
out of the reactor radioactive, but chemically 
it's still going to behave the same. You put table

39:41.360 --> 39:43.122
salt, for example, in the reactor, you're going to 
get out radioactive sodium and radioactive

39:43.844 --> 39:48.111
chlorine. But it's still going to react with 
sodium chloride in any chemical reaction you want

39:48.131 --> 39:54.561
to involve it in. And there's where the scientist 
can really use his imagination and put that to some

39:55.422 --> 40:02.814
use. So most of what you produce is used... In 
research. A&M research and such? These materials

40:09.629 --> 40:18.760
are used in research not only at A&M but in the 
medical fields and in industrial research.

40:22.304 --> 40:28.652
We're not necessarily serving the industrial 
side where they're selling a product. 90% or more

40:29.232 --> 40:34.799
of what we do for our commercial or industrial 
people is research. Materials are processes that

40:35.740 --> 40:38.303
will be the benefit of mankind.

40:45.819 --> 40:51.126
If you get a better product in the end, that's what 
we're after in serving these people. You said

40:52.387 --> 40:54.810
there were two basic things you did. Okay, that's 
the function of the reactor where you produce

40:54.830 --> 41:02.901
radioactivity in materials. That's called 
activation. If you're going to produce a given

41:07.308 --> 41:15.060
material, then that would be called isotope 
production of the other reactor. The other use of

41:15.080 --> 41:19.426
the reactor is the extraction of the radiation 
that it gives off.

41:22.611 --> 41:26.176
You're not necessarily producing the 
radioactive material anymore. You're tailoring

41:26.216 --> 41:34.709
a particular series of radiation particles that 
come off the reactor. In the nuclear reactor,

41:37.497 --> 41:44.524
provides you with a complete span of energies, of 
neutrons and gamma rays. It's called the spectra.

41:47.928 --> 41:55.255
And the experimenter, in many cases, will place 
materials in the beam ports. And he will block out

41:56.136 --> 42:04.425
certain energies of radiation particles he 
doesn't want. Or he'll put something in there that

42:04.445 --> 42:06.627
scatters them away. And he's left with the energy 
and the particle of interest. That's quite clever

42:14.274 --> 42:20.563
and requires sometimes a lot of hard work to get 
that done, but it can be done. Because the nuclear

42:23.267 --> 42:31.638
reactor, the fission process, gives you this wide 
range of energies to work with. Whereas the

42:32.900 --> 42:35.263
accelerator, will give you what we call the mono 
energetic energy the single energy and based upon

42:36.273 --> 43:05.065
the target that you choose for the high velocity 
for the accelerated particles it gets its name as

42:36.273 --> 43:05.065
an accelerator because it's taking charged 
particles charged nuclei and increasing their

42:36.273 --> 43:05.065
speeds to very high velocities bringing them up to 
those high speeds and then letting those

43:05.230 --> 43:09.574
high-speed particles strike a target. And in the 
reaction in that target, you will get a secondary

43:10.835 --> 43:20.825
radiation particle coming out that the 
experimenter uses. But in most cases, that

43:20.845 --> 43:28.933
secondary that comes out of there from the 
particle being striking is usually a one energy.

43:31.195 --> 43:33.077
It doesn't have this broad... energy range of 
particles that we produce. Most, almost all of our

43:39.121 --> 43:47.510
experimenters, though, are interested in the 
thermal, what we call the low energy neutron. So

43:47.530 --> 44:03.267
when you think about research reactors, you 
always think of neutrons as being the primary

43:47.530 --> 44:03.267
radioactivity

43:47.530 --> 44:03.267
or radioactive particle. or inducement of 
radioactivity that you deal with. Now, we have

44:07.180 --> 44:08.081
gamma rays. We can expose large systems or small 
samples all the way up to atoms that are 3, 4 feet

44:08.121 --> 44:22.200
across and 4, 5 feet high. We can expose those to 
gamma rays and neutrons, and we can actually mix

44:23.401 --> 44:27.287
the two. We have a large exposure for that kind of 
work. Has the neutron

44:33.166 --> 44:40.576
probably once been true ever since the center's 
been in existence? Oh, yes, because that's the

44:40.976 --> 44:45.002
main product of the reactor, sure. Yeah, that 
would be the interest of the engineer and the

44:45.442 --> 44:59.781
scientist to ever build it in the first place, is to 
have something such as a nuclear reactor that will

44:45.442 --> 44:59.781
produce neutrons. And once you have the neutrons, 
you can then start producing radioactive

45:01.769 --> 45:10.004
materials. You had those two different functions 
of the nuclear reactor, and you had the exposure

45:10.204 --> 45:16.115
area. Isotope production.
