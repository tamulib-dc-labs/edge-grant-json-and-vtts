WEBVTT

00:01.195 --> 00:16.655
What I'm saying is that the effort on Huggman's 
part was an effort that largely worked with some

00:01.195 --> 00:16.655
key downtown property owners to get something 
done in terms of the river. Huggman's idea was

00:16.775 --> 00:27.889
basically to, rather than the city turning its 
back on the river, was to make the river a very

00:16.775 --> 00:27.889
attractive amenity. And he came up with the idea of 
the the shops of Romulus and Aragon, I think the

00:29.714 --> 00:34.901
names are. And his entire plans, all his original 
drawings are in the archives of the University of

00:35.222 --> 00:54.069
Texas at Austin, although the San Antonio 
Conservation Society has a complete set of his

00:35.222 --> 00:54.069
drawings which are reproducible. So if anybody 
wanted to get a set. But the key thing was in that

00:57.102 --> 01:17.530
effort was to get the property owners to come up 
with enough money downtown to cause the federal

00:57.102 --> 01:17.530
government to come in with its major funds through 
the WPA and do the project. An election was held and

01:18.272 --> 01:24.200
it was some incredible minor amount of money. I 
think the whole That whole river walk was

01:25.385 --> 01:30.575
originally done for under a half million dollars. 
It was just an unbelievably small amount of money.

01:34.683 --> 01:39.993
But that, again, was initiated, again, as a 
private sector effort. And it did require the

01:40.414 --> 01:45.663
cooperation of local government and federal 
government. But it wasn't something that we

01:45.684 --> 01:48.068
really the local government initiated. La Vita, 
it was more the idea of a single person, Maury

01:50.017 --> 02:01.448
Maverick, who just coincidentally happened to be 
mayor at the time and a former congressman very

01:50.017 --> 02:01.448
close to FDR.

02:03.950 --> 02:09.315
The Riverwalk, for many years, remained a very 
dangerous area of downtown. And it wasn't until,

02:11.116 --> 02:16.401
essentially, from what I gather, the post-World 
War II era, that things really got moving quickly.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.824
Oh, it was a lot later than that, actually. As

02:21.204 --> 02:32.159
I said, after the initial improvements were made 
in the 1940s, it wasn't until the 1960s that

02:21.204 --> 02:32.159
anything started happening on the river. And 
there were a couple of things there that triggered

02:32.780 --> 02:46.978
that, one of which was the

02:32.780 --> 02:46.978
effort of a committee of the Greater San Antonio 
Chamber of Commerce I think Cy Wagner, the

02:48.427 --> 02:54.612
architect, had a major role. The San Antonio 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects

02:55.173 --> 03:11.687
and the Chamber of Commerce did a study to look at, 
now that you've got this amenity, what can you do to

02:55.173 --> 03:11.687
make it commercially viable and to get people down 
there? And there were a number of people, and

03:11.707 --> 03:16.932
again, that's a well-documented thing, there 
were a number of people that worked on that study.

03:17.249 --> 03:18.110
So that was one thing. The second thing was the 
hemisphere that was held in San Antonio in 1968 did

03:18.170 --> 03:27.239
a couple of things. One, it brought an enormous 
amount of visitors to San Antonio and really

03:27.459 --> 03:33.265
exposed the Riverwalk. And it extended the 
Riverwalk about 1,500 feet from its original path

03:33.726 --> 03:46.058
into the Hemisphere Plaza site, which was an urban 
renewal project. And that caused, I think, a lot of

03:47.050 --> 03:54.557
the renewed interest in the river. And if you look 
at the institutions on the river today, the

03:54.857 --> 04:13.414
Kangaroo Court, which was one of the first 
restaurant bars on the river, and some of the

03:54.857 --> 04:13.414
actors like the David Strausses and the Hatton 
Beltmans, their interest, their business

03:54.857 --> 04:13.414
interest in the river dates from that hemisphere 
period. So it wasn't until the mid to late 1960s

04:14.945 --> 04:20.432
that the river really kind of took off again. So 
almost 20 years went by when the river was largely

04:20.452 --> 04:29.763
ignored, except as a nice place to walk. But there 
wasn't the diversity and the commercial vitality

04:29.783 --> 04:36.391
that existed to that. And then the Colosseum del 
Rio was built for the fair, by Zachary. an alum of

04:43.919 --> 04:50.348
A&M, overnight

04:43.919 --> 04:50.348
virtually. Yes, that's true.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.095
OK, let's move on. You've mentioned several 
individuals already that have influenced the

04:56.616 --> 05:05.408
planning in San Antonio.

05:06.189 --> 05:13.639
Taking a look at the formal planning of San Antonio 
again, rather than citizen groups or whatever,

05:14.227 --> 05:26.723
Let's go through the sequence of planning 
directors and what contribution they brought to

05:14.227 --> 05:26.723
San Antonio.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.005
Okay.

05:30.809 --> 05:36.536
Well, again, the official planning director in 
San Antonio dates from the charter. And actually,

05:36.977 --> 05:42.664
the commission, the charter, as I mentioned, 
mandated a commission and a department. And the

05:45.670 --> 05:48.855
department was to support the commission. One of 
the interesting things about San Antonio is that

05:48.875 --> 06:04.882
although there's a council manager form of 
government,

05:48.875 --> 06:04.882
there's always been some confusion about to whom 
the director of planning shall report. And

06:04.943 --> 06:08.128
actually, the director of planning has two bosses 
in San Antonio. One is the city manager as a

06:08.362 --> 06:13.307
department head, and the other is the planning 
commission. The city manager by virtue of the form

06:14.388 --> 06:20.353
of government and the planning commission by 
virtue of Article IX of the city charter. The first

06:20.974 --> 06:30.383
planning director in the city of San Antonio was 
not appointed until March of 1952. And he was an

06:32.184 --> 06:38.250
engineer from Austin, Texas, by the name of 
William O. Parker. P-A-R-K-E-R. He became the

06:40.378 --> 06:43.381
first planning director. And really not a great, I 
don't really know a great deal about any

06:43.401 --> 06:49.868
contributions that he made. And I think I'm going 
to have all of these, these planning directors,

06:51.350 --> 06:57.877
but I may be leaving some out and I need to check on 
that. The second identifiable planning director

06:58.297 --> 07:03.883
was M. Winston Martin. And He served for a fairly 
short period of time. Martin was significant in a

07:10.103 --> 07:12.867
couple of respects. One, he was significant 
because the second formal planning effort in San

07:13.628 --> 07:32.014
Antonio, which even predated the charter, was the 
development of a plan in 1951

07:32.635 --> 07:36.459
that was basically an urban renewal plan. In other 
words, the city of San Antonio was eager to get into

07:36.599 --> 07:42.785
the urban renewal business. And in order to do 
that, there were certain requirements of the

07:43.786 --> 07:49.893
federal government to have a plan. And so, Winston 
Martin, working with Walter Lilly, who was a local

07:50.513 --> 08:00.904
planning consultant, basically put together the 
second formal plan that the city of San Antonio

08:01.272 --> 08:07.983
had. And I think that date, I think that was 
approved in 1951. Yes, December of 1951 that plan

08:12.950 --> 08:17.838
was approved. And that served as the basis for San 
Antonio to get into the whole... thing of urban

08:25.960 --> 08:28.985
renewal. And Martin left his directorship of the 
planning department to assume the directorship

08:29.886 --> 08:40.583
of the local urban renewal authority. So Martin, 
and Winston Martin is basically still there. He's

08:47.393 --> 08:52.401
still heading the local urban renewal authority. 
So he was responsible for having a key part in the

08:55.002 --> 09:01.068
second plan, and then becoming the first urban 
renewal director. He was succeeded for a period of

09:01.689 --> 09:05.472
time by Ralph Bender. Bender came to San Antonio as 
Martin's assistant, and after about a six-month

09:05.993 --> 09:21.448
period of time, he assumed the directorship of the 
Department of Planning, and was there only for a

09:05.993 --> 09:21.448
year or two, and left and went with when Ray Ellison 
was starting his home building empire and was the

09:22.120 --> 09:28.269
third man at Ellison. And this is where it becomes a 
little foggy, but I think Steve Taylor succeeded

09:28.289 --> 09:37.442
Bender as director of planning. I could be wrong on 
that. Taylor appears to have had the longest

09:38.844 --> 09:45.934
tenure of anyone as director of planning. left the 
planning department at the end of 1970, in

09:46.252 --> 09:51.719
December of 1970. And as far as I know, from the mid 
to late 1950s until 1970, Steve Taylor was the

09:52.680 --> 10:03.593
director of planning. Now, that was an 
interesting regime for a number of reasons. First

10:08.198 --> 10:15.567
of all, the planning department grew quite a bit 
during that period of time. in those early days

10:15.901 --> 10:27.737
when Parker and Martin and Vendor were the 
planning department, they virtually by

10:15.901 --> 10:27.737
themselves were almost it. In other words, there 
were very few professional staff. But during

10:31.803 --> 10:43.258
Taylor's tenure, substantial professional 
staff were added, including whom I would consider

10:31.803 --> 10:43.258
kind of the first professional planners. It's 
arguable whether Bender at that time, Bender's

10:46.740 --> 10:58.557
training was all in architecture, although he 
worked as a planning consultant and had worked for

10:46.740 --> 10:58.557
another city as a planner. It may be arguable 
whether he was the first professional planner in

10:59.218 --> 11:08.952
the city of San Antonio. Many attribute that to a 
guy by the name of Bill Telford, who was a graduate

11:11.993 --> 11:23.990
of Texas A&M, who was probably the first person the 
city planning department hired who had a degree in

11:11.993 --> 11:23.990
city planning. But people like Larry Travis, 
who's a well-known architect and planner, also

11:24.511 --> 11:34.385
worked for the planning department during that 
period of time. I'd like to say a few things about

11:34.685 --> 11:39.672
Taylor's... Bill, of course, went on to become 
president of the Texas, no, of the Gulf Southwest

11:40.057 --> 11:44.783
chapter of AIP. Right, right. And is now a 
consultant in private practice with a firm called

11:46.525 --> 11:52.613
Hallenberger and Telford. Doing well, I hear. 
Doing fine.

11:57.800 --> 12:07.633
The point about Taylor's thing, Taylor's long 
tenure as planning director, is that there were a

11:57.800 --> 12:07.633
number of attempts during this period of time to 
get the city to do some plan, another plan. In other

12:13.262 --> 12:20.560
words, from time to time, someone would look at the 
charter, either someone on the commission or

12:13.262 --> 12:20.560
someone on the council or some citizen and say, the 
city really doesn't have an official plan. The

12:28.760 --> 12:39.332
city adopted the Urban Renewal Plan 51, but that 
lacked many of the elements that we think of as key

12:28.760 --> 12:39.332
to a plan. For example, there was no land use 
element. I don't even remember if there was a, I

12:42.316 --> 12:46.120
don't think there was a transportation element. 
So significant elements were not there. So Taylor

12:50.594 --> 13:04.609
attempted in response to the times to work with the 
powers that be to engage in some planning efforts.

13:04.629 --> 13:06.370
And a couple of interesting things happened. One 
was that in 1961,

13:06.531 --> 13:17.462
some of the elected officials, the council 
members, felt that only way that some planning was

13:18.016 --> 13:25.843
going to get done was to split the then Planning and 
Zoning Commission in two bodies. To have a Zoning

13:26.764 --> 13:34.111
Commission and then to have a Planning Commission 
and charge the Planning Commission with coming up

13:26.764 --> 13:34.111
with a plan. So the Commission was actually split 
in 1961 and remained split for almost two years and

13:35.012 --> 13:46.723
was joined back together in 1963 when during the 
intervening period, the Planning Commission had

13:47.024 --> 13:54.674
really done nothing except to approve 
subdivision plans. And that was the first attempt

13:55.134 --> 14:04.066
to split the commission in two with the specific 
intent of charging the Planning Commission with

13:55.134 --> 14:04.066
doing some planning. It didn't happen. Taylor's 
staff, though, during the 60s, was engaged in a

14:07.790 --> 14:16.862
number of attempts to come up with a comprehensive 
plan. It's also kind of interesting, and this

14:17.332 --> 14:23.237
is... Steve Taylor is still around, by the way, and 
needs to be talked to. He's in the redevelopment

14:24.679 --> 14:26.080
agency? No, Steve Taylor is with the district 
office of the Texas Department of Highway and

14:26.100 --> 14:35.348
Public Transportation in San Antonio. But it was 
very interesting because of the leadership in San

14:36.649 --> 14:46.258
Antonio during the 1960s, and that was the period 
during which Walter McAllister, senior, was

14:46.643 --> 14:50.928
mayor. And he was a very strong mayor. In fact, he 
was almost a strong mayor of former government

14:54.232 --> 14:58.638
when he was mayor. He basically didn't want the 
planning department messing around with certain

15:00.360 --> 15:05.506
areas. And rumor mill has it that he actually went 
down and talked to the director of planning at one

15:05.606 --> 15:16.600
time and just listed things that he didn't want the 
planning department messing with in terms of

15:16.867 --> 15:17.568
areas. And I think that's kind of indicative of the 
view of many people in the community, and

15:18.049 --> 15:27.603
particularly the elected officials, toward 
planning. One of the things that we'll see in San

15:28.785 --> 15:42.465
Antonio is that, in my opinion, most of the 
community did not recognize the need for a

15:28.785 --> 15:42.465
municipal corporation to engage in planning 
until relatively recently. But the significant

15:42.485 --> 15:45.810
thing about

15:47.174 --> 16:16.472
Steve

15:47.174 --> 16:16.472
Taylor's reign is that in somewhere and I don't 
know exactly when this was but somewhere in the mid

15:47.174 --> 16:16.472
to late 1960s the city planning department came up 
with what is called a development plan of San

15:47.174 --> 16:16.472
Antonio and I think this is a fascinating document 
I'm holding in front of me it's a single fold out

15:47.174 --> 16:16.472
plan that has a little introduction in history and 
then deals with all of the key issues on one side.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.705
It's just a large fold up. So it deals with all of the 
key issues on one side. So it's got an introduction

16:33.930 --> 16:36.874
of population and economy transportation, land 
use, utilities. And then on the other side

16:39.899 --> 17:02.946
contains a single graphic, which given the fact 
that this was done in probably around the period

16:39.899 --> 17:02.946
67, 68, 69, is amazing in dealing with how the 
community actually grew, now that we can look back

16:39.899 --> 17:02.946
in hindsight, 20 years almost 20 years later. It 
was amazing in its ability to predict the location

17:05.242 --> 17:11.610
of facilities. And it's a single graphic which 
deals with land use, community facilities,

17:12.652 --> 17:20.482
transportation, and all of that. And the story 
about this plan is that it was so threatening to

17:21.424 --> 17:29.254
people, this single graphic. that all copies were 
confiscated and locked in the basement of City

17:29.538 --> 17:36.370
Hall for some number of years. And again, that's 
indicative of probably the attitude of San

17:38.393 --> 17:45.325
Antonio toward planning. But again, this is an 
amazing single graphic document. that is, as I

17:54.057 --> 17:59.826
said, amazingly predictive in what actually 
happened. Have those copies been released now?

18:03.512 --> 18:05.715
No, but there are a few copies around. I have a few 
copies of this in my own collection. So that was...

18:09.261 --> 18:14.829
We should get one for the project. Yes, we will try 
to arrange that. So that was Taylor. So Taylor, as I

18:21.665 --> 18:29.072
said, left the planning department in December of 
1970. And then he was followed. Well, first of all,

18:32.736 --> 18:45.909
there was an interim acting director, a guy by the 
name of Wilkerson, W-I-L-K-E-R-S-O-N,

18:32.736 --> 18:45.909
Wilkerson, J.H. Wilkerson, who served for almost 
a year. as kind of a transitional acting director.

18:54.395 --> 19:13.078
And for the first time, the city of San Antonio went 
out of its way to look for a professional planner to

18:54.395 --> 19:13.078
lead the planning effort in the city of San Antonio 
and ended up hiring, on August 1st of 1971, Edward

18:54.395 --> 19:13.078
F. Davis. And Davis brought to San Antonio for the 
first time the

19:20.744 --> 19:29.475
kind of professional stature to the planning 
department. And what I mean by that is this. He was

19:30.797 --> 19:49.300
able to recruit nationally a lot of very talented 
young planners of various disciplines and get

19:30.797 --> 19:49.300
them to come to San Antonio, very few of whom are 
still around. And the second thing is that during

19:49.837 --> 20:18.915
his fairly short tenure, which was only, I guess,

19:49.837 --> 20:18.915
about three years, the planning department 
produced, in my opinion, the greatest number of

19:49.837 --> 20:18.915
its studies and some of the really significant 
study efforts. He never produced a comprehensive

20:19.317 --> 20:35.440
plan, but what he did do is that he did some in-depth 
studies of geographical areas of the city, the

20:19.317 --> 20:35.440
functions of the city, and really dealt with some 
special things. They produced the urban design

20:35.500 --> 20:41.769
mechanism study during that period of time. We're 
really into major issues that dealt with the

20:42.050 --> 20:47.097
aquifer and urban renewal downtown. The San 
Antonio River Corps and a lot of those types of

20:47.448 --> 20:55.583
efforts also are directly related to his period. 
So although Ed's tenure was relatively short, his

20:55.603 --> 21:08.646
impact in changing the direction of professional 
city planning in San Antonio, both in terms of

20:55.603 --> 21:08.646
staff function, publications, et cetera, I think 
was perhaps as significant as anyone's in San

21:08.879 --> 21:16.411
Francisco. I don't know if you knew this or not, but 
Ed and I had worked together in San Francisco

21:16.431 --> 21:36.523
before Morpheus came to Texas as members of the San 
Francisco Urban Renewal and Planning

21:16.431 --> 21:36.523
Association, and had become quite good friends in 
San Francisco. So that when we found ourselves in

21:37.297 --> 21:44.185
Texas together, it was old homework. And Ed was 
also on my master's committee from when I was in

21:44.205 --> 21:52.175
school. Was he teaching? Yeah, he was doing some 
courses at UTSA. Actually, I think his tenure His

22:03.284 --> 22:05.387
tenure was only about two years. I don't think it 
was three years, if I recall. And there was strong

22:08.111 --> 22:10.094
pressure. I mean, he just incurred the wrath of

22:10.374 --> 22:16.744
politicians. It's also interesting that that was 
the period of time we'd really get into

22:16.784 --> 22:33.088
overcharacterizing

22:16.784 --> 22:33.088
the period as transitional, if we dealt with the 71 
to 73 period as transitional. It certainly was

22:33.237 --> 22:44.489
transitional in terms of planning, but it was also 
transitional in terms of politics because he

22:33.237 --> 22:44.489
really came up against the changing city council. 
Charlie Becker was a city council person who

22:44.589 --> 22:51.196
represented a lot of that change. The Good 
Government League had dominated San Antonio

22:51.496 --> 22:59.464
politics for almost 15 years.

23:00.068 --> 23:02.891
their political influence was starting to 
change. And Becker was emerging during this

23:02.991 --> 23:05.253
period of time. And Becker and his supporters were 
the new development interests in San Antonio, the

23:05.873 --> 23:14.381
land developers, the home builders, and those. 
And those were the people during that period of

23:14.942 --> 23:27.173
time that were the people that were most vehement 
in their opposition against the city actually

23:14.942 --> 23:27.173
telling them how to plan their land. And of course, 
Davis epitomized this in their eyes, and

23:27.355 --> 23:38.871
ultimately resigned because of it. Davis has 
subsequently returned to the West Coast. Yes.

23:44.539 --> 23:45.000
Oregon. Yes. Last I knew, he was in Eugene, and out 
of planning altogether. Oh, yes. Actually, a bit

23:52.270 --> 23:56.957
north of Eugene, near Oregon City. Okay, well, 
I've lost track of it. So that was Davis. And then

24:03.020 --> 24:22.224
there was a, there was, one of the things is, and I 
don't have all these, but in addition to changing

24:03.020 --> 24:22.224
leadership in the planning department, 
frequently the planning department changed

24:03.020 --> 24:22.224
names, it wasn't always known as the planning 
department, and frequently expanded or

24:03.020 --> 24:22.224
contracted with respect to its 
responsibilities. And on, in August of 73,

24:26.300 --> 24:38.112
succeeding Davis officially, Cipriano Guerra, 
G-U-E-R-R-A, became director of the planning

24:26.300 --> 24:38.112
department. Actually, at that time, the 
community development was coming into its own,

24:38.213 --> 24:50.606
CDBG funds and all that, so it was known as the 
Department of Community Development and

24:38.213 --> 24:50.606
Planning. And Guerra's tenure was a fairly short 
tenure, two or three year tenure. But a couple of

24:57.974 --> 25:01.740
interesting things did happen during that period 
of time. One of which is that the city published

25:01.760 --> 25:09.794
what was called a compendium of plans. And this 
wasn't a plan per se. It was published in September

25:13.841 --> 25:17.147
of 1973. It was a compendium of all the plans that 
existed at that time, basically dealing with

25:17.954 --> 25:34.417
functional areas, the airport master plan or 
various utility plans and things like that. And

25:35.298 --> 25:38.783
that was one effort. A second effort that started 
during

25:48.076 --> 26:01.769
Cipriano Guerra's period of time was the initial 
effort with respect to the growth sketch and that

25:48.076 --> 26:01.769
whole controversy that occurred in San Antonio. 
You were involved in that, weren't you? Well, in

26:05.153 --> 26:07.555
the later parts of that. But the first thing that 
occurred in that area was that in June of 1975, and

26:09.357 --> 26:17.745
Guerra was still director of planning at this 
time, the planning department made public

26:18.215 --> 26:24.764
something called the Alternative Growth Study. 
And that document was kind of a very interesting

26:24.784 --> 26:39.443
document and also spurred

26:24.784 --> 26:39.443
a lot of interest in San Antonio. What had 
happened? in San Antonio was that rather than

26:45.400 --> 27:13.450
start dealing with specific plan elements as the 
compendium of plans represented there was an

26:45.400 --> 27:13.450
attempt to say how is the community growing in 
which direction physically as well as size and

26:45.400 --> 27:13.450
what does that mean in other words if the community 
grows in a certain way what does that mean in terms

26:45.400 --> 27:13.450
of long-term effects on the community. So the 
initial alternative growth study and the

27:16.195 --> 27:40.679
subsequent study, which was done in

27:16.195 --> 27:40.679
January of 76, called Growth Sketches for San 
Antonio, what these studies attempted to do was

27:16.195 --> 27:40.679
just to paint a picture of different future 
scenarios of growth. And most of this work was was

27:43.822 --> 27:52.134
under the coordination of the assistant director 
of planning, who at that time was Charles

27:43.822 --> 27:52.134
Stromberg. And the reaction to these efforts, 
initially by the city council, was just

27:53.636 --> 28:04.633
overreaction, in my opinion. In other words, 
people saw, some of the elected officials saw

28:04.693 --> 28:11.803
these, growth studies as major threats to keeping 
the public sector out of dealing with the growth

28:12.323 --> 28:23.822
issues in any way. Even though they were... You 
mean the public sector or the private sector? The

28:27.368 --> 28:28.330
public sector. Keeping the public sector out of

28:28.350 --> 28:36.062
dealing with growth in any way. Even though These 
were the councilors. Again, these were

28:39.736 --> 28:48.868
developers on the city council that didn't want 
the city, the public sector, telling them how to

28:39.736 --> 28:48.868
deal with their land. So they saw the growth study 
and the growth sketches as the beginning of an

28:48.888 --> 29:01.504
effort on the part of city government to start 
planning and dealing with growth. Even though, if

29:02.386 --> 29:07.272
one goes through and reads these documents... the 
alternative growth study and the growth sketches

29:07.910 --> 29:21.023
and some of the ones that follow, if you look at 
them, they're nothing more than what they claim to

29:07.910 --> 29:21.023
be, scenarios. If these things happen, here's 
what the community is going to look like in 20

29:21.444 --> 29:25.107
years. If these things happen, and basically 
saying, here are four or five scenarios, which one

29:25.588 --> 29:33.436
do you want? And it wasn't, there wasn't a plan 
intended. But There was a great deal of reaction.

29:39.595 --> 29:46.642
Of course, one of the things that happened is that 
Stromberg was really forced out of his position.

29:48.304 --> 30:05.440
And there's a great deal of literature and 
editorials and writing that dealt with that whole

29:48.304 --> 30:05.440
controversy of him being forced out, largely 
because he was the one that was identified of doing

29:48.304 --> 30:05.440
these studies, even though they were extremely 
non-threatening types of studies and this whole

30:05.740 --> 30:35.022
thing resulted this whole thing resulted in later 
in March of 1977 of a a single document after a

30:05.740 --> 30:35.022
couple of years which was I think was called the 
preferred growth sketch finally As I said, these

30:35.626 --> 30:37.828
were introduced. This effort started publicly in 
June of 1975 and ended with the city council

30:37.848 --> 30:48.020
approving. And the last city council elected at 
large, essentially, approving just before the

30:48.140 --> 31:03.777
election, which was in April of 1977, approving in 
March of 1977 in what was called the preferred

31:04.195 --> 31:05.837
growth sketch. So it took almost two years to get 
city council, and again by that time many of the

31:06.437 --> 31:31.300
individuals on city council had changed, but it 
took two years to get the city council to come up

31:06.437 --> 31:31.300
with a

31:06.437 --> 31:31.300
basic policy statement concerning how the city 
was going to grow And that statement then could be

31:32.461 --> 31:37.462
used as a basis for the planning efforts to fall. 
But more needs to be said about that.
