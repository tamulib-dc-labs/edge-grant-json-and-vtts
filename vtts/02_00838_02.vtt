WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:07.851
And all of us in a group would walk wherever the 
party was. For instance, one night we met down here

00:07.871 --> 00:28.772
on Texas Avenue, I guess that's about 33rd Street, 
and walked out to home, not down by where I was born,

00:07.871 --> 00:28.772
a couple of blocks beyond, in a group. And then we 
all walked back to that same house and then made it

00:30.035 --> 00:40.968
around the very home where the girl lived. It 
wasn't any of them to spend the night. I was

00:43.991 --> 00:45.993
accustomed with that girl. I usually met her at the 
girl's

00:46.093 --> 00:50.098
house. And we always had a class party every year in 
school, grade school. different homes around,

01:01.253 --> 01:07.839
but I was there, of course, they were afternoon 
parties. How about birthday parties, Mac, in

01:07.859 --> 01:09.621
those days? Was that just a family affair, or would 
you have... No, they'd have big men, big birthday

01:09.661 --> 01:15.186
parties. That was a big thing.

01:19.190 --> 01:28.999
And, uh...

01:19.190 --> 01:28.999
Yeah, a dancing teacher came in, set up a class, I 
guess that was long, about 1913. That was the first

01:32.452 --> 01:41.242
one I ever heard

01:32.452 --> 01:41.242
of. My mother put me in the class.

01:45.728 --> 01:48.611
I was the only boy, about 14 girls. Well,

01:48.631 --> 01:52.876
did you enjoy it? Hell no. She whipped me every day 
before I agreed to go. Sometimes you'd have to

02:00.772 --> 02:06.360
crawl along. But they was a girl just about right 
for me, and they paired us. And I felt sorry for her

02:15.011 --> 02:22.341
because she had to dance with me every class, the 
whole thing. No changing around. Of course, what

02:24.211 --> 02:35.687
we enjoyed most in those days, they had a skating 
rink way down on Washington Street.

02:35.707 --> 02:36.929
That was a real attraction. We enjoyed that much 
more than trying to dance. We started at that

02:43.157 --> 02:52.210
maybe, well, I guess I was five years old when I 
started going there to skate. And it continued,

02:52.966 --> 02:57.972
and lots of grown people, all ages. My mother was a 
wonderful skater. Did they have shoe skates in

03:01.476 --> 03:04.199
those days? Yeah. The whole unit together, or just 
the clamp-ons? They had them. Oh, they clamped on.

03:09.585 --> 03:11.047
That was the only kind they had. Oh. Well, those 
others, they had the ice skates. Well, they have

03:17.815 --> 03:21.119
some roller skate now that are the shoe and 
everything all together. Well, it's been so long.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.503
The tees, they fit you. You wore you right in the 
shoes.

03:32.411 --> 03:35.175
My mother, as I say, was a wonderful skater. My 
father was clubbed in his hands. He didn't bust his

03:42.083 --> 03:43.845
ass. What are you talking about? That's all right. 
Why he didn't break himself, all the pieces, I'll

03:46.188 --> 03:51.795
never know. But all ages can.

03:57.204 --> 04:00.388
That's pretty interesting. Getting back away 
from the social activities a little bit, and right

04:00.408 --> 04:13.885
about the time of the First World War, speaking of, 
or just before, they were building locks out here

04:00.408 --> 04:13.885
on the river for river navigation, I understand.

04:15.856 --> 04:20.003
Well, that was quite... What did you think about 
that, or what did the people think about that? That

04:20.023 --> 04:21.365
was much farther back. They were going to make the 
Pazos River navigable to what the port was so they

04:21.385 --> 04:38.614
could compete with Galveston.

04:38.634 --> 04:39.315
They wanted to. take it all the way up to beyond wake 
who i think it's so much closer down as important

04:40.763 --> 05:06.619
was and then they tried to start work on on the 
trinity river we never did what but they put in a

04:40.763 --> 05:06.619
lock and down as they call it they put in several 
along i noticed one by her It was called Port

05:06.835 --> 05:11.922
Sullivan. And they had one down just this side of 
Navasota. Well, up in those days at Port Sullivan,

05:15.166 --> 05:20.993
could you see anything of the buildings that had 
been there at one time? Was Port Sullivan really

05:22.916 --> 05:25.079
still in existence then? It had been abandoned. 
But it's right close to Valley Junction, you see.

05:33.790 --> 05:36.353
That's where you change cars. the Southern 
Pacific to go to Houston if you wanted to go on the

05:38.054 --> 05:43.902
R&G end. And then from the R&G end came from Austin 
and San Antonio to Diamond Junction and change

05:45.163 --> 05:57.919
that to go to Houston or Diamond. See, there's a 
nice little great garden. The real, the main road

06:01.784 --> 06:04.568
was from I went to San Antonio, St. Louis. I went to 
Austin. I went to Austin, Palestine. I didn't go to

06:20.830 --> 06:25.397
Dallas or Fort Worth. I missed one in Brown. In 
Brown, I went to Spur.

06:31.066 --> 06:33.610
I went down to Houston. to Valley Junction.

06:47.250 --> 06:54.939
How about after World War II, the main 
agricultural business was still counting in the

06:47.250 --> 06:54.939
area? You mean World War I? World War I, I beg your 
pardon. It continued to be that. only cash crop

07:02.834 --> 07:25.554
until Roosevelt's administration when he put in 
the farm program and paid people not to raise

07:02.834 --> 07:25.554
cotton and corn and encouraged them to get into the 
cattle and grain solvent business. That's when

07:25.574 --> 07:32.841
you had the development of grain solvents and also 
your livestock in this country. Up to that time,

07:33.462 --> 07:40.150
they didn't have any improved pastures.

07:40.631 --> 07:46.378
They just had old common crossbred cattle. Nobody 
had any good cattle. And that, you know, Brazos

07:50.003 --> 07:59.615
County land is probably the poorest in the state, 
the natural land. It's either blow sand or hard

07:59.635 --> 08:02.659
pastures. One of the two. But since that

08:05.903 --> 08:17.920
time, in the early 30s, they have been improving 
the land so much that it's real good for grazing. It

08:19.423 --> 08:24.570
never was intended for cotton. But when I was a boy, 
they planted cotton to

08:24.590 --> 08:31.701
the fence. And they planted just enough corn to 
feed their own cattle.

08:40.703 --> 08:50.337
And, of course, everything was farmed by mules, 
most of the mule feed. Now, of course, they had a few

08:50.357 --> 08:51.839
horses to ride. The more affluent had buckets. 
Some had celery.

09:02.974 --> 09:03.375
We had a horse and buggy when I was a child.

09:11.748 --> 09:17.234
Kept that until about 19.

09:17.254 --> 09:17.935
I guess 15.

09:21.219 --> 09:26.825
Well, the Lawrence family seems to have stayed in a 
pretty high position of affluence throughout. I

09:27.906 --> 09:30.710
don't know much about the Howells. The Howells? 
The Howell family you mentioned? I'm not sure

09:32.371 --> 09:33.733
about it. Well, no, actually, the Lawrence family 
has always been just able to get by and scratch like

09:35.536 --> 09:48.374
hell, always in a bind. The Howells were the 
richest family in the Bronx. They owned

09:53.882 --> 09:57.106
everything. They even got into retail grocery 
business. And then... They got into wholesale

10:03.903 --> 10:07.728
grocery business. Howling Company did every bit 
as much, maybe a little more business than

10:07.748 --> 10:14.878
Lawrence Grocers Company. And that was just one of 
their interests. Lawrence Grocers Company, that

10:20.887 --> 10:27.476
was my father's main interest, almost. Well, he 
had a little interest for almost a long time. And

10:31.702 --> 10:33.825
that was a frustration.

10:36.421 --> 10:44.009
for a long time before he acquired

10:36.421 --> 10:44.009
control of the stock market. So after he started 
out, he owned about 40% of it. Maybe

10:47.552 --> 10:55.861
not quite that many. Well? In fact, he never did 
acquire control in his own name, but in the 20s,

11:09.091 --> 11:13.117
I wanted to sell his stock. My father recommended 
that I buy it, and I did. That gave us control of the

11:17.943 --> 11:22.089
two of us. Well, we had $102,000 worth of stock and 
$200,000 worth of corporation. That's the

11:30.321 --> 11:31.683
control we had. The Howells had nobody else 
interested in the family. the old gentleman and

11:37.863 --> 11:42.729
his three sons. What's happened to the Howell 
family since then? Well, they've all died out, and

11:45.432 --> 12:05.777
the only one who has left married a Navasota girl, 
and he moved down there and operated the

11:45.432 --> 12:05.777
lumberyard down there for a long time. sold his 
interest down there and then moved back here. But

12:10.058 --> 12:14.544
he's always been retired. Now, he's an unusually 
well-fixed man himself. He inherited a lot of

12:22.174 --> 12:24.257
money. He made a lot of money. But his wife was four 
more than he is. She's now a soldier. Her father was

12:32.808 --> 12:35.932
a doctor down there. He made a hell of a lot of money 
and died. Her mother. Is this going on the record?

12:45.285 --> 12:48.569
John, this will just be reviewed by graduate 
students. Well, no, Douglas. By mature people.

12:50.412 --> 12:52.334
You know, you can use any kind of language you want. 
Douglas and I, we were raised with it. He's raised

12:56.348 --> 13:02.135
where the city national bank is now. We played 
together. He's less than a year older than I am. But

13:06.139 --> 13:11.045
anyhow, his wife wasn't born here. She owned land 
down there around Nalasota. He inherited a lot of

13:15.590 --> 13:18.693
land here around Bob. Like I said, he's made a lot of 
money himself, but he inherited it. John, can you

13:25.694 --> 13:28.217
tell us a little bit about your mother a little 
more? More or

13:28.237 --> 13:41.070
less what she used to do, how she kept the house, not 
whether she kept it well, I'm sure, but did she have

13:28.237 --> 13:41.070
servants helping her? What kind of good food did 
she make for you? Well, at the start, she didn't

13:45.794 --> 13:48.137
have any help. Me and my father married, they 
didn't have any help at all. But then after we moved

13:55.040 --> 14:06.396
down on by the first bank here now, she began to keep 
cooking, as we called it. And she always managed to

14:06.416 --> 14:09.159
have a good one. But my mother was a wonderful cook 
and homemaker. And she'd take those niggers with

14:14.427 --> 14:22.398
no training at all, just no time at all. She'd make 
them into wonderful cooks. and servants, and they

14:25.651 --> 14:30.257
could serve the table and everything. Do you 
remember any special foods that we used to cook

14:30.277 --> 14:35.665
then or prepare then that we don't nowadays? Or 
let's say, what was your favorite?

14:42.494 --> 14:50.224
Well, my favorite always was meat and bread and 
rice and gravy and potatoes. But my mother had gone

14:50.244 --> 14:54.510
to a convent when she was a child, And they had a rule 
that everybody had to eat some of everything on the

14:55.182 --> 15:01.409
table. And my mother took that into effect too for 
me, but of course she couldn't make my father eat

15:02.269 --> 15:09.817
it. And she believed in lots of different 
vegetables all the time. And as a result, I had to

15:17.586 --> 15:23.552
eat some of everything that was put on, even if it 
was just a teaspoon for her. But as a result, I

15:24.005 --> 15:29.612
acquired a taste for most everything. And I like 
everything now except squash. My mother, for some

15:34.779 --> 15:43.871
reason, didn't serve squash, and I didn't like to 
eat it, and my wife had me there, and she begged me to

15:34.779 --> 15:43.871
let her. John, where did you meet your wife? At the 
University of Texas. At the University of Texas.

15:49.799 --> 15:50.940
In fact... My father said she's on the most wild 
thing I brought home from university or anything.

16:02.406 --> 16:05.391
He was crazy about it. But she was from Palestine.

16:10.598 --> 16:14.864
Of course, we married in 1920 and have lived here 
ever since. She feels like she's from Gaza. And you

16:22.173 --> 16:24.816
have a son, I gather, the lawyer? Yes, we have just 
the one child now. We had a daughter, but we lost her

16:31.062 --> 16:37.608
at 72 at age 44. But she had three children, and my 
son had two. So we have five grandchildren.

16:49.180 --> 16:49.260
Wow. Only one of them lives in Brown. That's the 
youngest. She's still in high school. But one of my

16:58.780 --> 17:04.026
granddaughters married a man who lives down in the 
bottom.

17:06.809 --> 17:09.051
She teaches school here in Brown. But we see her 
quite often. One of our grandsons is in Dallas. The

17:19.531 --> 17:25.339
other grandson is in Rua Dolce, New Mexico. The 
other granddaughter lives in Denton. No

17:29.185 --> 17:31.228
great-grandchildren yet? I'm about given up. 
This granddaughter teaches and has been married

17:35.754 --> 17:40.061
six years. This grandson lives in Dallas and has 
been married two and a half years. And my

17:49.383 --> 17:57.753
granddaughter that lives in Denver was married 
about four years before she got a divorce. She was

17:58.394 --> 17:59.416
single. So

17:59.476 --> 18:09.328
with that much exposure and no very 
grandchildren, I don't know that I'll ever have

17:59.476 --> 18:09.328
it. Well, we'll keep open, waiting. John, there is 
one item I forgot to ask that I know over in Brenham

18:12.212 --> 18:18.159
around First World War. I guess they're lot of 
anti-german feelings in the in a german community

18:19.268 --> 18:43.690
or there's a lot of mixtures did they have this 
problem here were there a number of german people

18:19.268 --> 18:43.690
here that were getting into i thought we were 
getting into the wrong war we had some in 19 18 17

18:19.268 --> 18:43.690
and 18 but very lovely there was Most of those 
people were loyal Americans, and they explained

18:45.155 --> 18:50.680
that. Now, some of those other counties, people of 
German extraction, they had quite a bit of

18:50.700 --> 19:00.410
feeling. We had lots of Italians here. And in World 
War II, there was some feeling that they were all

19:04.674 --> 19:14.183
loyal Americans. John, do you remember, there 
are, of course, quite a few prominent Italians in

19:14.804 --> 19:19.990
the community now. Do you remember when these 
Italian families first began moving into here?

19:26.156 --> 19:40.872
And did they come in with money, or did they just... 
No, most of them came in, came from the old country,

19:26.156 --> 19:40.872
as they called it, and steerage, and they made 
their way. Sidon... ones uh did well they worked

19:45.533 --> 20:15.068
hard they're the hardest working people that 
there is and that's the problem that made the order

19:45.533 --> 20:15.068
for them and as they had become affluent and could 
they would send money back and bring others over

19:45.533 --> 20:15.068
and help them get started maybe work them 
themselves maybe rent them a little land help them

20:15.689 --> 20:20.938
get credit to make a crop. And then they'd bring 
the, if they were already married, they'd bring

20:20.958 --> 20:30.855
the married wives over, the children. Some of them 
brought the girls, the sweethearts over and

20:32.718 --> 20:39.290
married here. But they all worked. And then I chose 
this Beresko family. That's a case in point.

20:52.223 --> 21:03.356
And a man built up substantial means for old man 
Tony Beresko over here and helped him get

20:52.223 --> 21:03.356
established. And he brought his family over and 
started them out. This brother, Floresco, who was

21:09.672 --> 21:23.088
an outstanding man, he came over with his mother in 
the steerage, joined his father.

21:26.672 --> 21:30.877
He made quite a bit of money on his own. The whole 
family now, all of those children did well. I

21:36.014 --> 21:52.068
suppose as a president of the bank, you saw a lot of 
development here in Bryan, economic

21:36.014 --> 21:52.068
development, a lot of success stories. I thought 
maybe we'll take a break just for a moment here. But

21:58.434 --> 22:03.979
I wanted to ask you, if you were talking to your 
great-grandson someday, what advice that you'd

22:05.393 --> 22:14.886
give to him to succeed in life and to, as well as 
economically, just to be a good person and a good

22:05.393 --> 22:14.886
citizen? I tell you, I told my children and 
grandchildren, first, keep the very best company

22:17.029 --> 22:25.521
possible. Second, choose a worthy objective, a 
challenge. Third, work at it hard. and live for the

22:35.313 --> 22:37.976
best things in life. Well, that seems like mighty 
fine advice. Well, it is the best I ever was, even if

22:40.598 --> 22:47.245
it isn't mine. Well, John, is there anything that 
you can think that you'd like to take that you might

22:47.265 --> 23:01.118
be especially interested in other people hearing 
about?

23:05.249 --> 23:22.167
Well, I think first that what development, and it 
seems phenomenal to me, is due to the economic

23:05.249 --> 23:22.167
thrust provided by Texas A&M. And second,

23:22.187 --> 23:34.800
Brown and College Station were both, you might 
say, blessed with good substantial ambitious

23:35.692 --> 23:45.324
people who were able to benefit from that economic 
thrust. And although there were two factions here

23:45.344 --> 24:02.726
and two factions at A&M, those factions worked 
together and competing with each other they

23:45.344 --> 24:02.726
brought out the best in each other. And so 
different factions pool their resources to

24:04.936 --> 24:15.849
develop businesses really worthwhile. For 
instance, the banks and then this building in Long

24:15.929 --> 24:27.182
Hill was organized in 1919. Of course, it's been a 
tremendous success. It was organized as a chamber

24:34.433 --> 24:45.313
of commerce project, and both factions supported 
it. Now, they each had a bank. There was a third bank

24:48.879 --> 24:57.775
of people that didn't belong to either faction, 
but all three banks worked for this association.

24:58.801 --> 25:05.410
and due to the economic thrust provided by A&M, it 
grew to its present size. John Beck, how do you

25:05.971 --> 25:12.140
think Brian fared during the Great Depression of 
29? Well, it was one of the bright spots in the

25:12.160 --> 25:16.846
nation. We thought we had it rough, but we didn't 
have it bad. We didn't have a bank failure. We had

25:23.936 --> 25:28.302
practically no business failure. We had very 
little unemployment.

25:34.979 --> 25:39.126
So you think it did generally better than probably 
most of the rest of the country? Well, with the

25:39.146 --> 25:44.615
exception of Boston, it was the best town in Texas. 
Of

25:45.175 --> 25:53.629
course, it was due to that tax money. That's what 
kept Boston so good. No doubt about that. But those

26:02.476 --> 26:12.507
people out there, they didn't get a cut until 1935 
or something when they were beginning to come out

26:02.476 --> 26:12.507
of the Depression. And they cut those people's 
salaries. But in the meantime, they kept this town

26:16.211 --> 26:20.195
going. That's interesting. You know, you 
retired, I think, at about the time that the air

26:22.458 --> 26:27.263
base closed out here. Is that true? Somewhere near 
that? Oh, I stayed on a while after they had closed.

26:38.469 --> 26:45.155
And I just wondered whether there was any 
excitement about the base closing and panic

26:38.469 --> 26:45.155
selling. Oh, yes. People cried out that we were 
ruined. No, it seems like it's grown tremendously

26:51.642 --> 26:55.245
since then. Yes, a little bit. It kept going. But it 
didn't affect us. It was a big thing, but it didn't

27:04.120 --> 27:14.493
compare with what Texas A&M did.

27:14.513 --> 27:25.006
But then

27:14.513 --> 27:25.006
in the 50s, we began to develop some industry here. 
Well, up to that time, all we had was a cotton

27:25.186 --> 27:30.392
warehouse and compress oil mill, and then they 
began to bring in this industry.

27:40.320 --> 27:48.990
Now that's a major contributor to the economic 
situation. You think that's pretty good for the

27:49.010 --> 27:51.192
town? Yes, it's good. Keep developing. Take this 
old line coal, send a knife, no furniture, no New

27:58.807 --> 28:04.054
businesses out on the west bypass. They employ 
lots of people.

28:08.920 --> 28:15.909
And they were all located here because of the 
proximity to Texas A&M. In order to be able to take

28:15.929 --> 28:22.418
care of that, or take advantage of that research 
foundation. That's why International Shoe

28:23.022 --> 28:28.869
came in here. Lenko came in here because

28:28.889 --> 28:41.024
All Britain was a graduate of A&M, and he had so much 
labor trouble in Houston, he had to move around. So

28:41.084 --> 28:45.790
he moved, he chose Brown because of his love for 
A&M. That's quite

28:46.512 --> 28:51.318
a bonus. Of course,

28:51.339 --> 29:13.148
then it's obvious that A&M played a pretty big role 
here in the community. But people on the right that

29:16.448 --> 29:21.376
the importance of that research foundation. They 
give credit to the extension service and the

29:21.456 --> 29:29.710
experiment station, and I'm certainly not taking 
anything away from them. They do a whole lot. That

29:31.012 --> 29:42.912
research foundation does a whole lot more than it 
gets credit for.

29:44.596 --> 29:49.265
Well, John, I guess we're just about at the end, 
unless you have anything more that you'd like to

29:44.596 --> 29:49.265
add. No, I don't know. Hang on. I don't know that 
this would be of any interest to you. Oh, yeah, this

29:56.379 --> 30:01.690
is going to be interesting, but I'll tell you, by 
tonight, I'll probably think of about 100

29:56.379 --> 30:01.690
questions I wish I would have asked you. Well, it 
just so happens I don't have anything to do with it.

30:07.951 --> 30:34.212
you think of something you think yeah if there's 
some gaps if you wouldn't mind doing it again some

30:07.951 --> 30:34.212
some even or you know a little bit more it wouldn't 
wouldn't take as long as next time to answer a few

30:07.951 --> 30:34.212
questions and uh john i'll uh i'm going to have a 
transcript made of this and i'll bring a copy to you

30:07.951 --> 30:34.212
for your own personal possession, and also, like 
them, if you'd sign a release, that this tape and

30:34.900 --> 30:45.594
that transcript can be used for research purposes 
at the college.

30:46.755 --> 30:48.117
Well, it's not wrong. I didn't ask you about any of 
the houses of prostitution or so forth, or whether

30:48.217 --> 30:58.410
you had any in Bryan, but what the economic impact 
of those was.
