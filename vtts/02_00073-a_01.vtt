Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:12.963 --> 00:21.554
This is September the 8th, I believe,

00:12.963 --> 00:21.554
at 8502 Amethyst Court. And I have the joy and honor 
of chatting with Dr. Roger Feldman about his

00:21.574 --> 00:32.367
memories of being a Texas A&M for a number of years. 
Roger, to introduce yourself to someone who might

00:33.292 --> 00:50.574
hear this tape or read the transcription, 
describe where you grew up, what family did, where

00:33.292 --> 00:50.574
you went to high school and college, experience 
before coming to A&M. Well, I was born before the

00:52.577 --> 00:57.223
Depression in 1925 on a farm in southeastern Iowa 
is located about 18 miles basically south of the

00:57.507 --> 01:07.917
town of Iowa City, Iowa where the University of 
Iowa is located. My one great grandfather had

01:08.618 --> 01:23.852
settled in that area in 1838 and this was my would 
have been my father's grandfather on his mother's

01:08.618 --> 01:23.852
side and then my Dad's grandparents on his 
father's side settled there in the mid-1850s. And

01:32.917 --> 01:35.380
they began farming. And then my grandfather 
followed his dad on the farm. And then my dad and my

01:38.004 --> 01:53.485
uncle took over farming the same territory just 
after the end of World War II, or World War I. I went

01:38.004 --> 01:53.485
to a rural school that had nine grades in one room 
with one teacher. The biggest class year we ever

01:53.937 --> 02:06.174
had as far as students in school was 33, but I was in a 
big class because I had six in my class all the way

01:53.937 --> 02:06.174
through from kindergarten through to the time I 
graduated from eighth grade. Then I went to high

02:06.975 --> 02:12.703
school in the small town of Kelowna, Iowa, which is 
in the same vicinity. At that time, it was really a

02:13.264 --> 02:17.650
very small community of only about 700 people. 
Being now only some 18 miles from Iowa City, it's a

02:17.933 --> 02:30.525
little bit of a bedroom community and has grown 
considerably to where it's now a town of about

02:17.933 --> 02:30.525
3,000 people and a very, very active place. And 
it's centered in the Amish Mennonite part of

02:30.665 --> 02:35.050
eastern Iowa. And the Amish and the Mennonites 
have both become very, very commercially minded.

02:42.417 --> 02:47.502
Tourism is a major activity, in fact, When Chuck 
McCandless was vice president and provost at Iowa

02:47.887 --> 03:02.925
State University, one of the tones that his wife 
had on her circle of tours for visiting

02:47.887 --> 03:02.925
dignitaries was that she would go from Ames to 
Pella to the Dutch community, then to Kelowna to

03:03.344 --> 03:13.477
the Amish Mennonite community, and then to the 
Amanda colonies west of Iowa City, which is a

03:03.344 --> 03:13.477
German colony that was established in the late 
1800s. And that was her circle of visitation for

03:13.597 --> 03:21.988
tourists in Iowa, and it has become very much that 
way. In fact, Kelowna now has become a major quilt

03:22.068 --> 03:27.715
center in the country. They have a quilt museum, 
and it's a very, very active and busy community and

03:28.167 --> 03:38.882
has prospered greatly, but still essentially an 
agricultural community. Went into the service in

03:40.204 --> 03:45.631
the summer of 1943 and got a medical discharge in 
December of 44. Then went to Iowa State in the fall

03:46.172 --> 03:55.845
of 1945, took one year of pre-veterinary medicine 
and graduated with a degree in veterinary

03:46.172 --> 03:55.845
medicine in June of 1950. And I spent the first 
seven years in the 50s in three different large

03:56.635 --> 04:05.284
animal practices, never really feeling 
comfortable in any of them. And as a hiatus, took a

04:06.726 --> 04:12.992
job with federal food inspection in the late 
summer of 1957. And one of the most fortunate

04:13.633 --> 04:22.963
incidents in my entire life happened in the spring 
of 1962. I got the opportunity to apply to go to

04:23.703 --> 04:34.132
graduate school at one of five schools that the 
Meat Inspection Service was working with at that

04:23.703 --> 04:34.132
time. Unfortunately, I got assigned to go to 
Auburn University and work on a master's degree

04:34.653 --> 04:41.199
and teach at the same time. I had grown up wanting to 
be a teacher and had been discouraged from

04:41.219 --> 04:52.309
teaching by both my high school superintendent, 
my high school coach, and others as well. because

04:52.643 --> 04:55.587
of the low salaries of teaching in those years. And 
when I got to Auburn, I found out that I had really

04:57.349 --> 05:04.378
been a teacher at heart all my life, and it hadn't 
changed any. Then at the conclusion of my master's

05:05.260 --> 05:20.760
degree program, I was reassigned to Fort Worth in 
the federal inspection station there, and was

05:05.260 --> 05:20.760
there for about eight months, and realized that I 
had to get back to school one way or another. A

05:21.196 --> 05:39.222
Friday evening, the last Friday in May in 1965, I 
called a friend of mine who had once been on the

05:21.196 --> 05:39.222
faculty here and was now at the federal station at 
Iowa State if he knew of any places that I could

05:21.196 --> 05:39.222
apply for a teaching position. And he said, well, I 
know that two people left the Department of

05:39.983 --> 05:46.292
Pathology at Texas A&M today. And he said, I'm sure 
that Dr. Bridges doesn't have replacements for

05:47.183 --> 05:52.892
them as yet. So on Monday, which was Memorial Day 
and was a federal holiday, my wife and my two

05:53.834 --> 06:11.082
younger children and I drove to College Station, 
had never been south of Corsicana in the state of

05:53.834 --> 06:11.082
Texas before in my life, and walked into Charles 
Bridges' office and told him I was looking for

05:53.834 --> 06:11.082
work. That was the last Monday in May of 1965.

06:16.541 --> 06:25.351
And 10 days after I was down here, I got a letter from 
him offering me a position beginning the 1st of

06:16.541 --> 06:25.351
July as an assistant professor in pathology. I 
took it. I moved here the last two days of June. And

06:30.256 --> 06:31.137
I'm still here.

06:34.100 --> 06:38.385
I gather that the search process consisted of Dr. 
Bridges. Essentially, because the man that I had

06:39.597 --> 06:51.349
worked for, I taught for, he wasn't in my master's 
program, but he was the man I taught for at Auburn,

06:39.597 --> 06:51.349
had earned a master's degree here, and Bridges 
knew him real well. So you think they chatted? Yes.

06:55.293 --> 06:59.657
Because when I left Auburn, Jim Neal told me, he 
said, you'll be back in school before you know it.

07:02.720 --> 07:08.406
Let's start by your describing Dr. Bridges, your 
impressions of him at first and then later. I wish

07:10.512 --> 07:18.821
in the late 60s and the early 70s that he and I could 
have gotten on the same page a little better. He

07:19.702 --> 07:23.586
didn't understand me, and I didn't understand 
him. I guess Ken Pierce summed it up the best. This

07:27.930 --> 07:31.714
was after Bridges had stepped down as department 
head. He said, you're different than most of us out

07:32.735 --> 07:39.422
here because, he said, you are a total university 
person. And this had to do with the things I was

07:39.925 --> 07:51.118
doing in the university as far as graduation was 
concerned, PA work in athletics, the Memorial

07:39.925 --> 07:51.118
Student Center, and many other things. And I was 
deeply involved in campus activities. I spoke at

07:56.385 --> 07:58.847
Muster every year. And these were things that no 
one at the College of Veterinary Medicine

07:58.928 --> 08:07.738
participated in other than me. Now, in the 
department, he operated as the department head,

08:08.765 --> 08:15.574
not the chair. Right. Meaning he ran things. Yes. 
Of course, now this was a carryover from the early

08:18.878 --> 08:27.569
days of professional veterinary medicine in the 
academic world, where there was a very small

08:18.878 --> 08:27.569
faculty. Most departments had no more than two or 
three, maybe four people in it. And it was left to

08:32.715 --> 08:37.101
the department head to do all of the mundane work. 
And the other people did the teaching. It was that

08:40.085 --> 08:44.891
way at Auburn, and it was that way here, and it was 
that way at Iowa State when I was in school there. In

08:45.291 --> 08:50.397
the Department of Pathology at Iowa State, when I 
was a student, there were two people. No, three

08:50.838 --> 08:51.459
people. There were three people in pathology, 
three people in microbiology, and that's all. I

08:57.366 --> 08:58.928
mean, they did it all. When you came here, when you 
joined the faculty, how many were in the

08:59.128 --> 09:03.814
department and who were they? Do you remember? 
Let's see. There were non-students. There was

09:09.000 --> 09:17.070
Charles Bridges, Ken Pierce, and I guess his given 
name is Michael Robinson. We called him Mick, but

09:17.530 --> 09:21.756
he was in the department. And everybody else in 
there were graduate students. Gary Adams, who is

09:27.875 --> 09:36.064
now the associate dean for research, Kay Reed, and 
Ernest Stare were all graduate students in the

09:27.875 --> 09:36.064
department. So there were just the three of them, 
because there had been five, and then the two left.

09:43.072 --> 09:45.155
And so there was still another opening after I 
came. Describe the physical

09:50.217 --> 09:54.783
and facilities of vet school in the UK. What was it? 
The veterinary school in the summer of 1965

09:55.384 --> 09:59.850
consisted of two structures. The one was the 
academic building, which was the first structure

10:01.072 --> 10:07.560
built out there and sat by itself. And the other was 
the clinic building, which housed the small and

10:07.660 --> 10:13.068
large animal clinic and the abattoir. And they 
were separated by a space of probably 30, 40 feet,

10:13.789 --> 10:19.937
maybe 50 feet. But they were separate entities. 
You had to go outdoors to go from one building to the

10:21.899 --> 10:23.782
other. Then it's either in the summer of 67 or 68 
they got the grant to tie the two buildings

10:25.244 --> 10:32.897
together and enlarge the clinic. And they did 
that. And then we since then have undergone at

10:35.962 --> 10:42.072
least three more expansions. And the department 
was located where at that time? On the second floor

10:46.259 --> 10:49.886
of a three-story building. The anatomy was on the 
first floor, and the dean's office was on the first

10:50.326 --> 10:53.572
floor. Microbiology and pathology were on the 
second floor, and physiology and parasitology

10:55.155 --> 11:01.547
were on the third floor. And were you given an 
office or a lab? I shared an office with Ernest

11:05.835 --> 11:07.778
Stare. What's his name? Ernest Stair. S-T-E-H-R? 
No, S-T-A-I-R. He was an Oklahoma State graduate,

11:14.104 --> 11:20.853
was here working on a PhD, which he completed in the 
late 60s. I don't know whether it was 68 or 69. And

11:23.376 --> 11:29.944
then he went to Nebraska, and then he subsequently 
ended up back at Oklahoma State where he had

11:23.376 --> 11:29.944
originally graduated. And this will be the only 
dollar question I'll ask. Your beginning salary

11:34.150 --> 11:35.892
was? 11,000. For 12 months? For 12 months. 
Describe your initial responsibilities. What

11:45.899 --> 11:48.785
was your work assignment? I essentially was in 
charge of post-mortem for the senior students.

11:53.658 --> 11:54.479
What did that mean? Well, that means the 
dissection and examination of all the deceased

11:54.779 --> 12:11.419
animals and reporting them back to the clinician 
and trying to arrive at a final, if they didn't have

11:54.779 --> 12:11.419
a diagnosis on the animal, try to provide one. Most 
of these were the fourth-year students? Well, at

12:15.423 --> 12:18.247
that time, it was only a three-year program, so 
they were the third-year students. These were all

12:18.988 --> 12:19.688
three-year students? Yeah, but they were all 
graduating seniors. Describe some of your

12:21.417 --> 12:31.313
learning experiences since you were a new 
teacher, some of your learning experiences in the

12:21.417 --> 12:31.313
early years with that task. Well, of course, I'd 
had a little exposure to this from my work with

12:31.473 --> 12:42.070
Federal Meat Inspection in slaughter of hogs and 
cattle. The old saying, you can't tell by the looks

12:44.514 --> 12:48.420
of a grasshopper how far it can jump. You also 
cannot tell from the outside of an animal what they

12:48.907 --> 12:53.132
look like inside. It was such a shock at times in the 
slaughterhouses to have seen animals walking

12:53.152 --> 13:15.199
around in the pens before they were slaughtered 
that looked to be perfectly healthy and good for

12:53.152 --> 13:15.199
food consumption, and then to get them on a killing 
floor and get them opened up and find out that they

12:53.152 --> 13:15.199
were just riddled with chronic and sometimes 
acute disease processes. And the same is true

13:15.899 --> 13:18.863
with... the deceased in the veterinary school 
here. In fact, I created a program that I gave to

13:22.011 --> 13:35.046
practitioners groups during, oh, this would have 
been in the mid-70s. which was essentially, gee,

13:35.566 --> 13:53.692
look what I found, things that just absolutely 
were totally unexpected in the animal that you

13:35.566 --> 13:53.692
were examining, things that you just had no idea 
from the clinical reports and the clinical

13:35.566 --> 13:53.692
behavior that this situation existed. And of 
course, with animals having such poor

13:54.513 --> 14:02.164
communicative abilities, if they don't really 
show you what's going on, it's very hard to tell.

14:02.465 --> 14:27.541
And it was really fascinating at times to see these 
animals that appeared to be doing quite well and

14:02.465 --> 14:27.541
then see what tremendous amounts of pathology 
they could have still within them and be still

14:02.465 --> 14:27.541
carrying on a fairly decent life until they would 
get just to that brink of when finally they fall

14:02.465 --> 14:27.541
over the edge and then they just go down like they 
fell off a cliff. Describe some of the student

14:27.561 --> 14:30.345
responses to this experience, both the serious 
and the lighter? Well, I suppose one of my most

14:35.916 --> 14:44.906
humorous incidents was that he always tried to be 
somewhat of a comedian at times. And Arden Kimler,

14:44.986 --> 14:52.975
who was in the anatomy department, used to have me 
do the section of a horse. for the anatomy

14:52.955 --> 14:54.260
students. It would demonstrate both some of the 
warm anatomy of an animal, as well as the technique

14:55.083 --> 15:04.298
of dissecting them. There was a fairly good sized 
crowd of students there that day. Probably, I

15:08.117 --> 15:12.763
don't think the whole class was, probably maybe 30 
or so of them were there. And they were in three or

15:13.524 --> 15:15.307
four rows. And I'm working away and talking at the 
same time. And I said, now, those of you who are up

15:18.752 --> 15:26.643
here close, if you watch close, you'll notice that 
at no time while I'm doing this do my fingers ever

15:18.752 --> 15:26.643
leave my hands. And I heard some guy in the back say, 
what did he say?

15:32.560 --> 15:35.005
They were writing down things so fast. Because 
Kemmler was a little tricky at times. And they were

15:37.772 --> 15:39.816
taking notes as fast as they could. And this kid 
didn't want to miss that. Did anybody ever

15:42.482 --> 15:48.696
almost faint or appear shocked? No. By the time a 
veterinary student, and I presume this is true

15:52.452 --> 16:07.609
with medical students, by the time they get 
through with freshman anatomy, they've inhaled

15:52.452 --> 16:07.609
so much formaldehyde that they don't really get 
shocked by anything. They're conditioned to the

16:07.629 --> 16:13.756
process. As you are beginning as a faculty member 
here, Did anyone ever offer you any guidance,

16:17.785 --> 16:27.853
advice, any kind of rules or suggestions? 
Surprisingly so, very little if any. And I

16:33.462 --> 16:39.791
suppose, because I had taught at Auburn, I was 
considered to be an experienced teacher. I'd be my

16:39.871 --> 16:40.552
guest. But I got very, very little, if any, 
guidelines in classroom decorum or anything

16:40.592 --> 16:47.622
else. It was pretty much left up to me. What did a 
veterinary faculty member wear to work in those

16:49.264 --> 16:53.530
days?

16:56.682 --> 17:01.487
Well, in a classroom, we all wore ties and shirts. 
In fact, when I retired in 1990,

17:03.069 --> 17:13.020
I can look back and say that this includes my time at 
Auburn and the time here. I never met a class other

17:13.561 --> 17:20.749
than in a working lab, in a post-mortem lab, 
without a tie. I just always did. In fact, a rather

17:23.929 --> 17:27.353
humorous incident with that. At Auburn, I was 
taking graduate work. And I was in a class in German

17:29.715 --> 17:34.360
up on the campus. And I thought this might help me in 
passing the German requirement for a doctorate

17:35.261 --> 17:40.507
later on. So I took a year of German. And one morning 
in class, the instructor was asking us questions

17:42.669 --> 17:47.755
in German. And we were answering him back in 
German. I was the only one in the class who was

17:52.640 --> 17:58.008
teaching, and I had on a shirt and tie. And he asked 
me in German what I had around my neck. And I very

18:02.015 --> 18:06.582
quickly answered, four children in German. And he 
about went under the desk. The other students

18:10.328 --> 18:17.078
couldn't understand why he was laughing so hard, 
because they didn't understand what meant, but he

18:10.328 --> 18:17.078
did.

18:19.943 --> 18:27.391
as you are getting settled in, who became your 
closest faculty or staff associates? Who'd you

18:27.771 --> 18:33.577
turn to, who were your best friends in those 
earliest years?

18:38.843 --> 18:40.785
Probably J.D. McCready. I had a better 
relationship with J.D. McCready than I did with

18:43.748 --> 18:45.309
Bridges. Describe him. Describe Dr. McCready. 
Make believe I don't know him. Well, I don't know

18:50.909 --> 18:52.971
whether I can or not. J.D. McCready was a most 
unusual individual. He was a tall man, very quiet,

18:56.574 --> 19:10.987
very unassuming, but he had a way of getting his own 
way in this very, whatever manner, whatever it

18:56.574 --> 19:10.987
took, he got it. But he was also somebody that I 
could talk to, and I did. There was also a fellow in

19:15.011 --> 19:19.195
the department named Don Clark, whom in later 
years I became very close to. I used to visit with

19:24.184 --> 19:25.686
him a great deal. And then a former student named 
James Anderson, who then spent the rest of his

19:26.427 --> 19:37.484
career in the Department of Physiology, and I were 
good friends, and I talked with him a lot. The

19:39.046 --> 19:45.295
people in the pathology department were so 
isolated, it was kind of strange, and they still

19:39.046 --> 19:45.295
are. They still are. Everybody had their own 
thing, and they pursued it, and they didn't

19:48.419 --> 19:54.666
interact with each other very much. You're saying 
that the individuals isolated themselves. Yes,

19:58.674 --> 19:59.515
yes. And the physiology department was a lot more 
collective group. And McCready used his people a

20:05.645 --> 20:09.671
lot more group-wise. He passed the 
responsibilities around and the teaching

20:09.731 --> 20:19.185
assignments around a lot more so than the other 
departments did. But then eventually he had more

20:19.225 --> 20:21.649
people. And he taught more courses. Did you ever go 
to him for advice on any important matters that you

20:24.845 --> 20:31.053
recall? What do I do about this or that? Yes. And one 
of them really created a strong barrier between

20:35.137 --> 20:45.730
Charles Bridges and I until 1976, when I finally 
confronted him with it one day, and things changed

20:46.283 --> 20:54.274
from that point on. When tenure was started at 
Texas A&M, I was in the latter stages of my PhD

20:55.095 --> 21:01.844
program. I had four children, and I wasn't going to 
get finished with the PhD by the time the seven

21:02.405 --> 21:15.463
years for tenure was up. And I

21:15.443 --> 21:22.351
went up to McCready and said, J.D., I don't know 
what to do. I said, I can't get finished in time.

21:27.497 --> 21:31.261
There's no way that I can get finished in time. He 
said, I don't have a PhD in my whole department. And

21:35.146 --> 21:35.906
I don't have one. I'm never going to have one. He 
said, take the tenure. And so I did. And learned

21:40.772 --> 21:43.855
later on that that really infuriated Bridges. He 
couldn't do anything about it. He had to grant me

21:46.308 --> 21:50.234
tenure, but it really infuriated him. And things 
rode along, and we just kind of ignored each other.

21:56.103 --> 22:03.313
And in the summer of 76, there was an international 
food conference at Iowa State. And there was an

22:04.695 --> 22:09.663
alumni gathering simultaneously with it at Iowa 
State that I wanted to go to. So I put in a request. to

22:12.717 --> 22:25.402
Dr. Brady's to get, I think, it was either a day's 
vacation, I guess it was, to attend that without

22:12.717 --> 22:25.402
any cost to the department. And I got a real terse 
turn down from him. So I sat down and I wrote him

22:31.094 --> 22:35.319
about a four-page handwritten letter. Didn't 
take it to the secretary to type it. Wrote it to him

22:39.044 --> 22:44.911
and put it in an envelope and sealed it and took it up 
to the department secretary and told her to give it

22:39.044 --> 22:44.911
to him. And about 30 minutes later, he came back to 
my office and sat down in a chair and we talked. And

22:53.602 --> 22:56.365
from that point on, he and I have been good friends. 
And then two months later, I ended up having a third

23:01.604 --> 23:05.008
of my right lung removed. And I found out from 
someone else that he was really concerned, that he

23:05.769 --> 23:16.622
really was deeply concerned about my welfare. But 
I still have the greatest respect for him because

23:17.223 --> 23:23.871
he was the one that let me come here. And so if it 
hadn't been for his trust in me, I wouldn't be where

23:25.133 --> 23:31.020
I am. And I respect him for it. And I respect him for 
the feelings he had. We're just different. I mean,

23:37.806 --> 23:44.574
I'm different than other people in my feelings 
towards the university. And so it's

23:45.355 --> 23:48.218
understandable. People don't understand why I 
did commencements for as long as I did or how I did

23:48.278 --> 23:53.424
them. But I enjoyed it. And it was something that I 
found that I was doing that was useful. And the

24:00.869 --> 24:07.120
people for whom it was being done were satisfied 
with it, and so I kept on doing it. Because we're

24:07.961 --> 24:10.365
going to get to those in a minute. Let's stay with 
the vet school for a second. Who was, make believe I

24:12.028 --> 24:15.414
didn't know who the dean was in those years. 
Identify him and describe him and his

24:16.255 --> 24:20.242
characteristics. Because the first, what, 10 
years, 11 years, was Alvin Price.

24:30.147 --> 24:35.178
I never got to know Dr. Price all that well when he 
was dean. I knew him a lot better after he was

24:36.261 --> 24:47.245
dean.

26:17.962 --> 26:18.573
That's it.

27:06.190 --> 27:25.363
Thank

27:06.190 --> 27:25.363
you.

28:15.260 --> 28:28.256
But

28:15.260 --> 28:28.256
it really didn't get to be that bad. It's just that

28:28.356 --> 28:44.997
particularly then after getting

28:28.356 --> 28:44.997
some domestic problem.

28:57.515 --> 29:01.399
This is what, of course, that's inevitable. But it 
was along

29:01.939 --> 29:24.602
in the 70s, which was an aftermath of, not an 
aftermath of this, but the problem with the

29:01.939 --> 29:24.602
isolation of the school to work is we had a real high 
divorce rate amongst married students. One of the

29:25.190 --> 29:38.030
major problems with it was that when Friday night 
came, as I said many times, that we were very

29:25.190 --> 29:38.030
fortunate that our students only drank once a week 
from Friday night until Saturday night.

29:41.816 --> 29:51.872
They

29:41.816 --> 29:51.872
just didn't have any social activities at all.

29:55.008 --> 29:58.132
seriously taught out there, but it didn't seem to 
be as much of a problem. And we still have a lot of

29:58.612 --> 30:04.239
marriages, inter-class marriages. After

30:05.981 --> 30:21.319
they left school, which was somewhat of a surprise 
to me, and not either. It's kind of like I told a

30:23.695 --> 30:44.461
couple of them one time, one of the problems with if 
they had wives that worked on the campus, that

30:23.695 --> 30:44.461
their wife worked in or

30:23.695 --> 30:44.461
things you've got to remember. You're

30:44.521 --> 30:52.251
going to be veterinarians

30:44.521 --> 30:52.251
when you're You're not. You're competitors in a 
variety of ways, and you're different.
