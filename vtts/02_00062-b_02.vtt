Just the idea about football, just a line or two, 
just a heck of a lot. All right, as you look back at

00:12.673 --> 00:27.372
A&M now, what parts of A&M are dearest to your 
heart, that you are most concerned about, care

00:12.673 --> 00:27.372
most about? Well, I think they've done everything 
that I would expect to be done by this time.

00:34.936 --> 00:39.803
Athletics has just gone beyond my experience. But 
if somebody were to try to persuade you to make a

00:40.985 --> 00:52.261
gift to anything, what would be the area that... 
Well, I'd do the scholarships, academics,

00:40.985 --> 00:52.261
without... I think there's Gloria Mammaliga was 
over here the other day, and... She's got a little

00:56.579 --> 01:03.927
fund down there for anal, I guess, through health 
and physical education. Would you restrict it to a

01:04.007 --> 01:07.350
certain academic area major? Not necessarily. 
Okay. All right. Because I feel like that's a

01:11.495 --> 01:18.782
well-run, at least my experience through the 
class agency all those years, it's a well-run.

01:18.802 --> 01:26.130
It's big now, but, you know, our class is down 
probably around 1,000, 1,100 in the, You know, you

01:26.988 --> 01:34.556
knew those guys, and you know them today, and those 
are the wonderful things that we have. But my

01:34.576 --> 01:43.586
combat unit, we get together every summer, and 
that is really, you know, it's a family, extended

01:34.576 --> 01:43.586
family. Sure. All right, let's quit then with your 
favorite Aggie stories. Can you share with me one

01:52.035 --> 01:56.320
that would be kind of melancholic? I'd have to 
think about those. And do you have a fun one that you

01:59.813 --> 02:03.859
enjoy telling? I just about do. Do you have any 
other one than that one you told? I'd have to think

02:09.808 --> 02:16.999
about it because that in that story I told you about 
Mr. Heaton and Mr. Rudder, Coach Myers to me,

02:17.099 --> 02:26.273
because that really was, you just don't realize 
how good that was. All right, then let's quit, and I

02:27.586 --> 02:30.357
thank you very much.
