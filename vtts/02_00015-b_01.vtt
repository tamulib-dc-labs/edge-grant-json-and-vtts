WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:11.922
Her family was threatening to sue A&M, and I remember in the paperwork, among the questions she had been asked was, how long have you wanted to be a veterinarian?

00:13.044 --> 00:17.952
And she, according to the notes, paused and said, well, two or three months.

00:19.574 --> 00:23.220
Had she ever been responsible for caring for an animal?

00:23.200 --> 00:28.751
She thought that when she was in the first grade, they had had a cat or a dog for a few months.

00:29.833 --> 00:35.303
Then did she have any association with a veterinarian of any sort?

00:36.064 --> 00:39.331
She thought she knew where one had an office, but she'd never met it.

00:40.593 --> 00:44.280
And as I recall, what she was told was,

00:44.260 --> 00:49.247
You prove to us within the next year that you really are interested in veterinary medicine.

00:49.267 --> 00:52.632
This is not a passing fancy, and we will guarantee you admission.

00:53.213 --> 00:54.174
They threatened to sue.

00:54.835 --> 01:03.147
Instead, though, she went back to UT and did her master's degree in biochemistry and went on.

01:03.127 --> 01:09.415
I'm assuming that's not an unusual situation with some.

01:10.396 --> 01:12.959
Back to the real world.

01:13.400 --> 01:31.362
As you began to dig in deeply into this college and the department and so forth, how did you, when you arrived, compare our facilities and physical facilities with those you had left at Minnesota?

01:33.063 --> 01:34.225
How did this?

01:36.129 --> 01:52.843
The facilities here were basically two-story building with offices on second floor and labs primarily in the first floor and a couple of very, very large lecture halls.

01:53.228 --> 01:56.754
My class had 56 students in it.

01:56.975 --> 02:01.924
So I came to a school that had 128 students per class.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.610
I was not used to that number of students around.

02:06.432 --> 02:12.042
But it also had a faculty and a facility that could support that number of students.

02:13.104 --> 02:17.211
So the emphasis at that time, too, was teaching.

02:17.933 --> 02:26.064
Yes, you did some research, and that's important, and it always has been, but the students were the primary reason we were here.

02:27.687 --> 02:35.578
In Minnesota, the same was true, although we saw a little bit more emphasis on research.

02:35.598 --> 02:41.806
We had a strong tie with the Minneapolis health science complex, their medical school there.

02:42.107 --> 02:45.932
There was no medical school here, and so that

02:46.047 --> 02:47.809
relationship did not exist.

02:48.950 --> 02:54.957
The faculty at Minnesota, when I look back on them, were famous people.

02:55.337 --> 02:56.018
I didn't know it.

02:58.982 --> 03:02.886
The faculty here were not well known outside of the state of Texas.

03:03.527 --> 03:05.489
That has certainly changed over time.

03:06.870 --> 03:10.114
The quality of education

03:11.663 --> 03:20.236
I think at almost any of the veterinary schools in the country at that time was probably pretty much the same.

03:21.017 --> 03:32.694
They might be a little bit better in pathology or in small animal or in large animal or whatever, but the overall education was probably pretty much the same.

03:35.438 --> 03:38.903
As I've watched the faculty grow,

03:40.098 --> 03:47.805
because of additional demands put on them over time.

03:49.167 --> 03:51.809
I've watched the change in faculty.

03:54.452 --> 04:01.158
And it changes somewhat by department, and that's a reflection of department heads, as would be appropriate.

04:01.478 --> 04:06.223
They bring in the type of people that have the types of interests that they want to promote.

04:07.233 --> 04:20.637
I will say that if I look at the anatomy and now anatomy public health department, the emphasis has strongly changed from the education to the research.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.263
In the small animal department,

04:25.998 --> 04:54.739
While there is definitely an added interest in the research component, every single faculty member has a strong, strong commitment to teaching the student and will spend much more time on the floor with the students than occurs in some of the institutions that we are often compared to.

04:55.563 --> 05:08.931
When you, in your first years down here, did anyone from Minnesota ever give you any hint of what they thought of this school's qualities?

05:09.772 --> 05:13.957
I never knew of anyone from Texas A&M at Minnesota.

05:13.977 --> 05:16.180
No, but did any Minnesota person ever.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.903
They didn't know much about Texas A&M either.

05:19.244 --> 05:20.605
We were an unknown entity.

05:21.126 --> 05:34.783
And yet, if you go out today and you look at papers presented on teaching, research, growth within specialty areas,

05:36.350 --> 05:38.273
It's always Texas A&M at the top.

05:38.553 --> 05:49.548
More papers, more faculty, more presence in organized veterinary medicine and research aspects of veterinary medicine and specialty areas of veterinary medicine.

05:49.989 --> 05:53.494
Right now, how, who, how, why did that change?

05:55.256 --> 05:57.860
It changed because of the commitment of the faculty here.

05:59.101 --> 06:00.383
Did somebody encourage that?

06:07.788 --> 06:36.715
Of course, department heads and deans, I think probably starting with George Shelton and the department heads he brought in, at a time when the state had a very strong commitment to veterinary education from a funding standpoint,

06:37.403 --> 06:44.011
We were encouraged to go to and be part of organized veterinary medicine.

06:44.592 --> 06:46.454
That meant we went out to meetings.

06:46.935 --> 06:50.980
Because we were there, suddenly A&M was recognized.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.489
Because of the quality of people we had here, we became leaders within organized veterinary medicine.

06:58.929 --> 07:02.634
We became the people who presented the CE.

07:03.014 --> 07:07.039
We became the people who were the officers.

07:07.019 --> 07:08.368
And that was okay.

07:08.388 --> 07:10.039
We were allowed to do that.

07:10.643 --> 07:13.502
And we developed a reputation of

07:13.786 --> 07:23.059
really being good teachers, which we knew we always were, but now we had the opportunity to go out and spread that word.

07:23.640 --> 07:33.394
And because of that then, we were able to draw and attract high-quality new faculty, high-quality residents and interns.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.499
And that allowed us to still go out because now we had the reputation.

07:37.780 --> 07:43.708
Well, call Dr. Beaver, call Dr. Wolf, call Dr. Willard, call Dr. Lees, call Dr. whoever.

07:44.043 --> 08:06.135
because we now we have that reputation and are allowed to continue that reputation right in your in your specialty uh where do you think we running nationally number one who else is competitive there are 23 board certified veterinary behaviors in the world

08:07.178 --> 08:11.887
There are seven residency programs in the US in behavior.

08:12.608 --> 08:13.971
One of them is at A&M.

08:14.652 --> 08:15.474
One of those 23.

08:15.794 --> 08:18.239
She happens to have been the first president.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.864
She happens to be the executive director.

08:21.124 --> 08:22.487
Her name keeps

08:22.973 --> 08:23.874
being out there.

08:24.274 --> 08:30.380
So people think of A&M as one of the first places when they think of animal behavior.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.782
Who else, though, is becoming competitive?

08:33.162 --> 08:38.087
Well, the University of California at Davis has several residency programs in behavior.

08:38.687 --> 08:45.233
And they have two, and soon they hope to be three, board-certified behaviorists.

08:46.394 --> 08:50.398
Cornell has a well-identified program.

08:50.378 --> 08:53.962
Pennsylvania certainly has an outstanding program.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.583
They have the advantage.

08:55.723 --> 08:56.564
They're in a big city.

08:57.125 --> 08:58.787
They've got the animals that can come in.

08:59.107 --> 09:08.577
We've got people that have to drive from Houston, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Oklahoma, Louisiana, New Mexico, but they come.

09:09.578 --> 09:18.867
On that one, as a kind of curiosity, give some examples of people that came from extreme distances to bring their animal.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.830
The furthest I've had was Connecticut.

09:22.912 --> 09:28.280
They had an Irish wolfhound that was biting people.

09:29.762 --> 09:31.966
They started down the East Coast.

09:32.146 --> 09:39.298
It was a couple that would show dogs occasionally, wolfhounds, and they had a retired couple that had a motorhome.

09:39.678 --> 09:40.860
They drove down the East Coast.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.968
They stopped at the University of Florida to see if they could help them.

09:45.948 --> 09:49.594
The University of Florida said, you need to see Dr. Beaver at Texas A&M.

09:50.235 --> 09:52.819
They started across the Gulf Coast states.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.402
They stopped at Louisiana.

09:54.923 --> 09:58.509
LSU folks said, you got to see Dr. Beaver at Texas A&M.

09:58.529 --> 09:59.791
So they kept on coming.

10:00.572 --> 10:03.958
And we could at least describe the why the dog had it.

10:04.138 --> 10:08.125
There isn't a lot we could do in that particular situation, but we could describe it.

10:09.100 --> 10:18.318
I think of one that came down from Wichita Falls with a German Shepherd, a relatively young adult dog, about a year, year and a half of age.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.805
And the complaint was the dog was excessively shy.

10:22.887 --> 10:31.243
And the dog would hide under, in fact, when I went out to get them in the waiting room, the dog was hiding under the lady's chair.

10:32.118 --> 10:40.615
Well, this was not desirable because this was supposed to be an obedience champion and they couldn't even get it into an obedience class, much less an obedience ring.

10:41.837 --> 10:49.672
So we got to talking to her and this is one of these intuitive things which I think I got from my mother.

10:49.752 --> 10:52.658
There's something in the power of observations.

10:53.819 --> 11:08.437
It was one of the first, not the first, cases that I had, where in watching the dog in the exam room, I noticed the dog was extremely observant, constantly monitoring everything that was going on.

11:08.457 --> 11:11.741
And I said, there's something besides shyness in this dog.

11:12.622 --> 11:16.006
And we decided to treat it like a hyper dog.

11:17.748 --> 11:23.235
And by the next day, the veterinarian, she put it on certain drugs,

11:23.452 --> 11:24.133
sent it home.

11:24.713 --> 11:28.758
The veterinarian called me the next day and said, I don't know what you did, but you worked a miracle.

11:29.539 --> 11:30.941
The dog is no longer shy.

11:31.401 --> 11:32.342
It is outgoing.

11:32.883 --> 11:38.169
I had a few little things that we could adjust and fine tune, but it would totally change this dog.

11:39.310 --> 11:52.345
Since that time, we have actually refined hyperactive hyperkinesis in animals, dogs primarily, better than is understood in human medicine.

11:53.084 --> 12:00.398
All right, now as you start developing this specialty, what were some of the key achievements, the key steps?

12:00.939 --> 12:06.469
When did you first, first big project or first big publication,

12:11.343 --> 12:21.139
First publication would have been in the early 70s, right around the same time that the people in Harlingen had asked for the, because I thought, well, I can write on that.

12:21.179 --> 12:25.566
So I'd write for like the Southwestern Veterinarian, which was the student publication at that time.

12:27.008 --> 12:29.472
And it just kind of progressed from then on.

12:30.754 --> 12:38.987
So the first step, I guess, was being allowed to, and going and giving some CE programs in behavior.

12:39.625 --> 12:47.834
The next big step, I think, was getting the hospital appointment so that I could see cases coming into the hospital.

12:47.854 --> 12:51.337
Even though I was on the anatomy faculty, we were allowed to do that.

12:53.119 --> 13:08.856
The next big step was starting an elective for biomedical science students in behavior, which then led to noontime seminars, come if you want to, in animal behavior and human-animal bond.

13:10.743 --> 13:16.292
Which then led to an elective course for veterinary students in animal behavior.

13:17.674 --> 13:28.032
Which then eventually led to putting a behavior course, one credit, but it was a course required in the core curriculum for the veterinary students.

13:29.153 --> 13:31.958
And then that eventually led to

13:32.647 --> 13:34.109
This is a veterinary subject.

13:34.169 --> 13:36.291
We're going to take it out of the biomedical science.

13:36.311 --> 13:38.073
We're going to leave it in veterinary medicine.

13:38.554 --> 13:42.899
Plus, now students could see cases with me coming into the clinic.

13:42.919 --> 13:44.381
I was moved over to the clinic.

13:44.401 --> 13:45.943
That was a biggie, biggie for me.

13:47.965 --> 13:57.777
Then we went on a downslide because, well, from the core course, the core course and elective courses were taught.

13:59.613 --> 14:10.592
Approximately six years, about six years ago, the curriculum was changed again.

14:11.113 --> 14:12.556
You know, every six years you change curriculum.

14:12.576 --> 14:23.595
Well, at that point in time, they decided that the important stuff would go into major core courses and they took animal behavior out as a required course.

14:24.908 --> 14:33.621
I said fine, if the faculty says that it's not good enough to be, it's not important enough to be core, I'll take it out.

14:33.641 --> 14:35.043
We don't need an elective either.

14:35.664 --> 14:40.191
So there were two classes of students that went through without any behavior.

14:41.613 --> 14:45.178
And I took the stand that

14:45.563 --> 14:46.785
It needs to be core.

14:47.446 --> 14:50.031
I'm not going backwards in this progress.

14:50.271 --> 14:51.113
It's going to be core.

14:51.634 --> 15:01.390
So we have now reinstituted some, not, it isn't as a specific course, but we're allowing some lectures on it.

15:01.631 --> 15:04.536
So with that then I put back in the electives.

15:04.977 --> 15:09.765
Who deserves the greatest credit for being supportive of your efforts?

15:11.095 --> 15:12.458
Which dean's department?

15:13.581 --> 15:16.849
The greatest support absolutely was George Shelton.

15:16.869 --> 15:18.273
No question at all.

15:19.235 --> 15:23.907
Racists, very important in that.

15:24.241 --> 15:28.925
The department heads in Small Animal, Bob Plater had just gone off.

15:29.506 --> 15:35.551
Bob was a good friend for a long time, but he was supportive in allowing me to come over and see those cases.

15:36.292 --> 15:44.980
Ken Knauer as an interim, then John August, wonderful support there, and certainly David Williams now as the current head.

15:46.041 --> 15:54.248
Were there any important research grant givers that were helpful?

15:55.105 --> 15:58.529
Bless every dollar I got from every group that I could get it.

15:59.150 --> 16:17.974
It's never been a big dollar research thing, except the biggest one that I will say and consistently has been a man named Dan Christian, Dr. Dan Christian, who's a veterinarian, the veterinarian at first, now there are two, with Frisky's Pet Care Company.

16:17.954 --> 16:23.120
And Frisky's Pet Care has supported the residency program in behavior now.

16:23.621 --> 16:29.048
They're just starting their fifth year of support.

16:30.830 --> 16:40.502
That has been a tremendous boon, not only to the department and the college, but also to the discipline as a whole.

16:40.735 --> 16:46.302
Now, was there any publication that was kind of the big breakthrough nationally?

16:46.602 --> 16:50.847
Well, the first one, the one that you remember is your first book.

16:51.328 --> 16:52.770
Yeah.

16:52.790 --> 17:02.361
Now, my first books were actually anatomy books, but my first behavior book was published in 1980 by Mosby, big publisher.

17:02.642 --> 17:07.688
They had come and asked, would you do a book on cat behavior?

17:07.668 --> 17:11.073
And I was foolish enough to say, yes, not knowing.

17:11.173 --> 17:15.398
Well, at first they kind of wanted a dog, and I said, you know how much literature there is out there?

17:15.418 --> 17:24.551
Well, what I didn't realize is there's more in the cat than there is in the dog, at least science literature, because the cat was a model for neurological studies.

17:25.011 --> 17:28.095
So all this brain stuff is out there with the cats.

17:28.896 --> 17:29.858
So I did that.

17:30.979 --> 17:33.102
That led to...

17:33.335 --> 17:36.438
Two more books plus a revision of the cat one.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.982
And the cat one's just gone into the, will be going into the third edition.

17:40.382 --> 17:42.244
I'm working on that revision right now.

17:42.664 --> 17:45.767
So from a behavior standpoint, that first cat book.

17:46.528 --> 17:54.136
And it was a wonderful experience because I could sit down and go through each subject in detail at the library.

17:54.216 --> 17:58.060
And I was, that's when I learned how much stuff is in our library.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.822
I was so impressed.

17:59.842 --> 18:01.283
I thought there was nothing over there.

18:01.443 --> 18:03.325
There was beaucoup's of stuff.

18:04.469 --> 18:17.472
And going through that and sitting down and really learning and then having the good fortune at that time, Dr. Sissett had two people in, one whose primary purpose was to read.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.315
She was an English major.

18:20.317 --> 18:21.640
And she read.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.705
And she would go through manuscripts.

18:25.141 --> 18:29.772
with a fine tooth comb, read them backward and forward and say, this sentence doesn't make sense.

18:29.993 --> 18:30.915
That's paragraph.

18:30.955 --> 18:31.838
What do you mean by that?

18:32.740 --> 18:33.702
It was wonderful.

18:34.183 --> 18:38.554
It became an extremely clear document when it was done.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.103
And I thank him forever for doing that.

18:42.708 --> 18:46.632
This has nothing to do with our interview, and the typist doesn't need to include this.

18:48.213 --> 18:55.420
One of my small little efforts has been to try to get the press and veterinary medicine together, the NM Press.

18:56.181 --> 19:00.345
Iowa State has a very good series in veterinary medicine and their press.

19:00.485 --> 19:03.348
One of my books is with Iowa State Press.

19:03.548 --> 19:05.330
Two of my books are with Iowa State Press, actually.

19:05.410 --> 19:10.875
I argue that all university presses ought to have at least two kinds of areas of emphasis.

19:10.855 --> 19:14.638
One of books about the region where that institution is located.

19:15.293 --> 19:16.014
We do that.

19:16.574 --> 19:21.019
The other would be in the disciplines for which that institution is well known.

19:21.579 --> 19:26.584
All right, we haven't done much in our press on agriculture or veterinary medicine.

19:26.644 --> 19:31.089
Well, and we're moving in both directions, I think, now.

19:32.810 --> 19:33.191
Let's see.

19:34.512 --> 19:41.379
Either early, middle, or late, did anybody ever give you advice about being a faculty member at Texas A&M?

19:42.500 --> 19:42.820
No.

19:43.323 --> 20:08.487
nobody said no do or not to do or the the the testing procedures was trial by fire and looking at people like Arden Kimmler and some of those looking back on it I think there were kinder and gentler ways to do it but that was the way it was done in that era

20:09.192 --> 20:15.060
But it was a growing process, so it's part of my learning process as well.

20:15.361 --> 20:19.026
Testing is such a fallacy anyway.

20:19.827 --> 20:23.893
It's how do you evaluate students?

20:26.176 --> 20:27.578
There isn't a good answer for that.

20:27.678 --> 20:30.222
And how do you mentor young faculty?

20:30.903 --> 20:38.153
Nowadays, we often are assigned or pick somebody to be your mentor.

20:40.900 --> 20:46.728
I hope it's helpful, and I really do worry about young people coming in on faculty.

20:46.748 --> 20:53.919
We actually have, it's very difficult, particularly in clinical sciences, to attract new faculty.

20:54.880 --> 21:03.432
And while a position in, let's say, wildlife science may attract, heck, 100 applicants, we're lucky to have one.

21:04.660 --> 21:29.790
And part of the reason is the economics of it, because specialists now, which is what we require as board certification, can make so much more in private practice with four and a half day weeks, with state of the art equipment to back them up, we can't even begin

21:30.715 --> 21:40.343
And then you bring them in, and you not only throw them into, you've got to do your specialty and do it well, but you've got to teach students.

21:40.363 --> 21:43.746
So you're going to have somebody at your elbow 12 hours a day.

21:44.527 --> 21:46.549
And you've got to cover emergencies.

21:46.969 --> 21:50.692
And you've got to go into the classroom and teach.

21:51.653 --> 21:55.817
And you've got to have a great big, big dollar research program.

21:56.537 --> 21:59.760
And by the way, we've got a whole bunch of committees we need to put you on.

22:01.259 --> 22:07.608
I'm real concerned about where veterinary medicine is going to get quality teachers.

22:08.509 --> 22:15.599
As far as you know, those realities here are no different from the other top-notch vet schools.

22:15.620 --> 22:16.481
That's correct.

22:16.821 --> 22:17.522
They're the same.

22:17.763 --> 22:18.824
They're the same.

22:18.964 --> 22:30.000
Did you have any kind of role model faculty colleagues that you selected yourself that, okay, I'll kind of try to

22:30.638 --> 22:33.202
watch them and pattern my efforts after.

22:34.304 --> 22:38.251
There were a lot of people that I would take bits and pieces from.

22:39.954 --> 22:47.567
One of my great pleasures this past year, the award hasn't been given, but it will be.

22:48.340 --> 23:02.462
was actually an ambulatory clinician at Minnesota who, unbeknownst to him, really became a role model on compassion and humane care for animals.

23:04.906 --> 23:09.913
Other people would serve as role models for how to give a test.

23:11.075 --> 23:16.103
My mother was a role model on being a teacher and

23:16.555 --> 23:26.363
how to get out and be a teacher, be the thespian that a teacher has to be.

23:29.228 --> 23:33.012
Others have been role models in how to work with clients.

23:33.472 --> 23:36.575
So a lot of people have been important.

23:36.595 --> 23:41.239
I didn't have the women ahead of me to say, that's what I need to be.

23:41.600 --> 23:46.284
I was smart enough to realize that there were those coming behind me that were going to watch.

23:46.865 --> 23:54.132
Now, whether I will be judged as having been a good role model, that I don't know.

23:54.552 --> 23:56.434
History will say.

23:56.414 --> 24:03.026
But I at least understood that I had that obligation to the next generation.

24:04.108 --> 24:06.051
And during, you've been here now 30?

24:06.071 --> 24:07.173
31 years.

24:07.194 --> 24:07.955
31 years.

24:08.055 --> 24:18.594
During those 31 years, has any one faculty member or administrator come to you and ever said, uh-uh, a woman doesn't do that?

24:19.957 --> 24:20.177
No.

24:21.575 --> 24:30.305
Do you feel, as you look back on your years here, that you were treated with relative equity compared to the men?

24:30.585 --> 24:30.785
No.

24:31.286 --> 24:31.686
You weren't?

24:32.267 --> 24:33.849
Give them some... Twice.

24:35.511 --> 24:35.991
On record.

24:36.752 --> 24:40.657
And all you have to do is check the salaries.

24:41.377 --> 24:46.283
The approximately my second or third year here,

24:46.567 --> 24:53.219
I went over, as we were often advised, to go look at the salary book over in the library.

24:53.420 --> 24:53.902
I did that.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.851
Back before salaries were public.

24:56.945 --> 24:58.327
They were public, they were published.

24:58.848 --> 25:02.252
But I mean, they weren't available in the department as they would be now.

25:02.272 --> 25:03.654
Oh, I don't even know if they are now.

25:05.296 --> 25:16.591
But I did that, and I was shocked to find that a faculty member that came at the same time, but had one less year experience, in other words, a new graduate, was getting more than I was.

25:16.791 --> 25:22.299
And so I confronted, being ignorant, I confronted my department head and said, why?

25:22.759 --> 25:24.201
He said, well, he has family.

25:25.160 --> 25:51.876
his family to support his wife isn't working he's got small children I said excuse me what happens if something happens to me if something happens to him she can go to work something happens to me I'm stuck so that was one time that was equaled out the next year the right so you're saying that that that inequity was corrected yes then

25:52.598 --> 26:10.042
Several years later, after I had moved over into the Department of Small Animal Medicine Surgery, there was a legal action where salaries discrepancies from the past were corrected.

26:11.064 --> 26:15.670
And so I know that there had been discrimination in the past.

26:17.118 --> 26:25.791
But those are the only, that's the only kind of blatant discrimination that I was bright enough to understand.

26:26.873 --> 26:28.275
If others existed, I don't know.

26:28.535 --> 26:32.281
Because I always took the, I'm going to do what I enjoy.

26:32.301 --> 26:33.723
I enjoy the people.

26:34.204 --> 26:35.125
I enjoy where I am.

26:35.425 --> 26:36.527
I enjoy what I do.

26:37.435 --> 26:40.241
And in terms of promotions, you feel that you were treated?

26:40.261 --> 26:42.105
I was treated very fairly.

26:42.125 --> 26:43.328
Okay.

26:44.130 --> 26:44.611
Let's see.

26:45.753 --> 26:46.916
You mentioned the library.

26:48.339 --> 26:54.212
The library and the labs and so forth here, relatively high quality?

26:54.850 --> 27:01.961
A&M has facilities, including libraries and labs, that I will say are second to none.

27:02.382 --> 27:05.127
We've had times where they need upgrading.

27:05.447 --> 27:08.893
The large animal facility is an example of that.

27:09.894 --> 27:12.118
But it wasn't because it wasn't workable and doable.

27:13.540 --> 27:15.323
But with that said,

27:16.670 --> 27:20.314
I don't care what kind of facilities you have.

27:21.435 --> 27:25.480
It's the faculty that drive learning.

27:25.980 --> 27:31.266
If you don't have a good faculty, that's when the student suffers.

27:31.987 --> 27:35.030
And we have always had a good faculty.

27:37.373 --> 27:46.002
Can you recall any, I'll call it, gender-related events in a class or in a departmental meeting?

27:47.078 --> 27:47.378
Yes.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.442
Share some, please.

27:50.462 --> 27:54.928
Well, first of all, being introduced to the faculty is integrating the faculty.

27:54.968 --> 27:57.811
That will forever stand out in my mind.

27:57.891 --> 28:03.718
And I probably should have taken it negatively at the beginning, but I thought it was funny, and I really enjoy it.

28:04.299 --> 28:06.101
To me, it's kind of been a highlight.

28:06.722 --> 28:14.892
The other thing was I was very active for several years with the American Cancer Society, the local chapter.

28:14.872 --> 28:27.703
And the first year they had their Kiss Me, I Don't Smoke campaign, their anti-smoking campaign, they had a little badge that was a frog, and it said, Kiss Me, I Don't Smoke.

28:27.763 --> 28:32.387
So on the Great American Smokeout Day, I wore that badge to lab.

28:32.808 --> 28:41.655
Well, we came back from a break, and there was a lineup of there must have been 30 of the male students standing in line waiting.

28:41.915 --> 28:44.878
I thought, this is great.

28:44.858 --> 28:47.723
And were they smiling?

28:48.024 --> 28:48.946
You bet they were.

28:50.428 --> 29:07.440
They would also every so often, particularly when we got into the reproductive systems, there would be a few snide comments or attempts to put one over on the hair professor.

29:08.129 --> 29:28.516
Now, in the history department, we heard occasionally of some anecdotes as coeducation became a reality over here on this side of the tracks of some of the good old boy faculty members that had to change some of their stories and some of their anecdotes that no longer would those work.

29:29.317 --> 29:34.103
Did you become an advisor to some female veterinary students?

29:34.083 --> 29:37.366
Did sometimes they come to you for advice and counsel?

29:37.626 --> 29:43.932
The female students, particularly in the early years, always sought me out because I was the only woman that they could talk to.

29:44.412 --> 29:50.278
And there were a lot of times boyfriend troubles, health problems, problems at home.

29:50.998 --> 29:54.802
The worst thing, and well, they would seek me out.

29:54.862 --> 30:03.870
Now, in general, I can say I was thinking back, brought back some memories on the worst thing that I

30:03.850 --> 30:17.044
ever had happened as a faculty member was I was in charge of the gross anatomy lab, large animal anatomy.

30:18.226 --> 30:22.430
I had gotten a call from the dean's office.

30:22.450 --> 30:33.402
I found out that one of the students in that class had committed suicide and they had just found out about it and I had to make the announcement to that class.

30:34.765 --> 30:42.353
That is a real heartbreaker to lose any of those high quality people like that.

30:43.094 --> 30:47.879
And then you start, then you get the, okay, let's talk through it.

30:47.919 --> 30:55.047
Let's talk about it and find out he had been a loner and a lot of kinds of things.

30:55.147 --> 31:02.916
Maybe it could have been seen coming and apparently it probably should have been seen coming, but there probably again would have been nothing anyone could have done.

31:03.976 --> 31:11.993
Did any of the women, the female vet students, come to you for advice about the profession?

31:12.834 --> 31:13.856
Yes.

31:14.257 --> 31:15.600
Normally, what were their concerns?

31:16.482 --> 31:21.833
They wanted to know, could women have families and be veterinarians?
