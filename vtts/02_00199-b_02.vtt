WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:05.477
trying to persuade him to try the decathlon?

00:06.298 --> 00:07.560
No, I never did.

00:07.580 --> 00:09.583
We didn't have decathlon way back there.

00:10.404 --> 00:16.613
We didn't in the early, I mean they had it, but we didn't have, we didn't have it.

00:18.676 --> 00:27.789
The, all right, this is now, because Randy's in the 64 and 68 Olympics, so you've been here about 10 years.

00:29.672 --> 00:32.316
The athletic director

00:33.308 --> 00:37.878
officially ended up quite often in that time being the head football coach.

00:37.898 --> 00:39.000
Right.

00:39.020 --> 00:43.791
And what was it like to work with Gene Stallings as the athletic director?

00:43.811 --> 00:47.980
Well, Gene was a great guy.

00:48.861 --> 00:51.908
I mean, he was a dedicated football coach.

00:52.613 --> 01:01.122
And the first thing I learned when I came to Texas A&M, Bone Durbin told me that football pays the way.

01:02.264 --> 01:05.768
And everybody knew it.

01:05.788 --> 01:08.831
See, we didn't even charge for a track meet, all right?

01:09.071 --> 01:12.495
Everything I spent probably came out of football budget.

01:12.515 --> 01:16.339
And Bone said, he said, here's something else.

01:16.379 --> 01:22.266
He said, basketball loses more money than your whole budget is for track.

01:22.246 --> 01:24.569
He said, that's how much money they lose.

01:25.290 --> 01:28.033
He said, everything we spend is made from football.

01:28.133 --> 01:31.437
So from word go, and I knew that, you know.

01:31.878 --> 01:34.421
I knew that we didn't have much money in those days.

01:34.481 --> 01:39.667
So, I mean, I really worked with all football coaches.

01:39.687 --> 01:48.858
But Gene Stallings was a great guy, and the only thing, he had a conflict with Randy one time.

01:49.419 --> 01:50.380
Describe that.

01:51.608 --> 02:00.583
Well, see, our only discus ring, shot ring, was out in the back of the place out there, out behind the scoreboard.

02:01.384 --> 02:04.729
Well, the football field was back further back.

02:05.030 --> 02:07.113
I mean, we had the discus ring marked off.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.355
The football practice.

02:08.476 --> 02:09.357
Yeah.

02:09.377 --> 02:16.148
But at the end, like when you throw the discus, you were throwing towards the football team.

02:16.583 --> 02:21.332
But it was back further enough where he couldn't throw far enough to hit the player.

02:21.372 --> 02:27.122
But anyway, we were out there one time, and here comes this manager in his white uniform.

02:27.142 --> 02:28.044
He ran up.

02:32.171 --> 02:36.499
I was gone, but what happened, he sent this manager over there, told Randy,

02:36.867 --> 02:39.755
to quit throwing, afraid he was going to hit somebody.

02:40.657 --> 02:45.892
And Randy told the manager, he said, I can't quit throwing, I'm trying to go to the Olympics.

02:47.215 --> 02:49.662
And they don't ring a guy, I got to throw here.

02:50.333 --> 02:59.581
So anyway, then stalling, I hear what happened, because like I said, I had my freshman track team, we went to San Angelo, and we were gone.

03:00.482 --> 03:06.888
But I heard about all that when I soon got back, Randy, Mr. Meeks, and Bones River, and everybody ganged up.

03:06.908 --> 03:09.690
But the bus rolled up there full of my freshmen.

03:10.451 --> 03:14.835
I had about 35 or 40 just full of all my freshman track team.

03:14.875 --> 03:18.538
In those days, freshmen couldn't go to Southwest Conference Meeks.

03:18.558 --> 03:20.340
We had a regular freshman track meet.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.365
We roll up there at the end by the stadium, let the kids out.

03:25.385 --> 03:29.128
Well, everybody ganged up there and they said Randy Mattson's leaving, going home coach.

03:29.168 --> 03:29.949
I said, what the matter?

03:29.969 --> 03:36.274
And they told me about the story, what the deal was.

03:36.395 --> 03:41.639
And sure enough, he was packing up to leave.

03:41.659 --> 03:47.965
He was packing up, and the dean of the head of the

03:49.666 --> 03:58.069
Oh, who was the guy that was, he's the head of the department that controls the athletics.

03:58.189 --> 04:00.936
Five, four or five on that committee that's over the.

04:01.237 --> 04:03.122
Oh, the faculty athletic council.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.165
Yeah.

04:04.617 --> 04:13.108
He came there and he, you know, he went back over and talked to Randy and, I mean, everybody.

04:13.609 --> 04:18.636
And then in about two or three hours, these two guys from Houston showed up.

04:18.656 --> 04:26.867
I mean, I don't know how the word got around so fast, but those, the two that brought him down to the village, they both came down here to keep him from leaving.

04:26.887 --> 04:32.835
Didn't also then, didn't somebody contact Mr. Rudder and Mr. Rudder contacted Gene Stallings?

04:32.883 --> 04:34.065
Not to think so.

04:34.405 --> 04:35.107
Yeah, I think so.

04:35.928 --> 04:38.132
And it evaporated.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.395
Yeah.

04:40.415 --> 04:45.584
In all of your years working with Randy, what was the happiest moment for you?

04:46.205 --> 04:52.134
What were your proudest— Well, him making the Olympic team and— Did you get to go to Mexico City?

04:52.154 --> 04:53.777
Well, I was going, but—

04:55.175 --> 05:00.426
Let's see, that's when Billy Pickard got sick, the trainer.

05:01.088 --> 05:04.054
And see, the Olympics in Mexico City was during football season.

05:04.214 --> 05:12.492
All right, Pickard got run down, and they had to send him into the hospital.

05:12.472 --> 05:16.476
He was taking uppers and downers or whatever.

05:16.937 --> 05:20.841
And he was so busy that he was living in the training room.

05:20.881 --> 05:21.521
He had a cot.

05:21.702 --> 05:22.482
He never went home.

05:23.063 --> 05:27.147
But he was having, him and his wife was having a little trouble too.

05:27.668 --> 05:29.309
But anyway, Pickard got sick.

05:30.491 --> 05:34.815
And Gene said, Charlie said, you're going to have to take over and be the trainer.

05:35.356 --> 05:37.838
Because I had my trainer's license, you know.

05:37.878 --> 05:40.521
I was a qualified trainer.

05:41.463 --> 05:46.833
And doctors, you know, doctors come down to practice every now and then.

05:46.853 --> 05:49.578
And if you had trouble, you'd just send a guy to the hospital, this and that.

05:49.598 --> 05:57.211
But anyway, I said, well, Coach Dalton, I can't go to, I can't be an athletic trainer.

05:57.291 --> 06:02.100
I said, I got to go to the Olympics in two and three weeks or something.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.342
He said, I already got my tickets.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.905
And the Aggies, see, they,

06:04.885 --> 06:15.549
And it was the Houston guys, I think, but they bought my plane ticket in two weeks and went to the Olympics and all that stuff paid, everything paid for, you know.

06:16.131 --> 06:21.122
So I'm going watch Randy throw the shot for the Olympics, you know, that's a big deal.

06:21.102 --> 06:21.923
You know, you can't go.

06:21.983 --> 06:22.604
You can't go.

06:23.125 --> 06:23.986
You got to be the trainer.

06:24.006 --> 06:26.991
He said, what's more important, Texas A&M or Randy Mattson?

06:27.612 --> 06:29.615
I said, well, I guess Texas A&M.

06:29.915 --> 06:31.678
Well, you got to be here.

06:31.698 --> 06:34.222
So I had to give up and be the trainer.

06:34.242 --> 06:39.389
And I went to about five games with the trainer.

06:40.371 --> 06:43.956
And I missed the Olympics.

06:44.016 --> 06:45.398
This is another editorial note.

06:45.418 --> 06:50.586
I asked Randy one time about his proudest moments.

06:50.954 --> 07:05.572
and he said one of his proudest moments was standing on that pedestal or whatever they call that platform when they played the national anthem and he was holding the gold medal.

07:05.633 --> 07:10.098
He said to win that for the United States made him very, very proud.

07:10.118 --> 07:18.649
All right, after Coach Stallings leaves, Emory Ballard became

07:19.085 --> 07:22.049
the head coach and athletic director.

07:22.069 --> 07:26.495
What was it like, what was he as the AD?

07:27.056 --> 07:29.259
He was real good.

07:29.619 --> 07:30.760
Emory was real good.

07:30.981 --> 07:35.787
In fact, he, for his track, he was great.

07:36.708 --> 07:46.361
Emory used to be the head and meet director for the big high school meets in Brackenridge.

07:46.982 --> 07:48.484
And Brackenridge had a great

07:49.342 --> 07:51.584
sprinter, and I recruited a guy at East Texas.

07:52.445 --> 07:57.068
His name was Clyde Harris, and he was just right under Bobby Marr.

07:57.289 --> 08:09.999
I mean, in fact, the first time he raced, he almost beat Bobby Marr, and that's how I got to know Emer Bellard through the recruit that I had at East Texas State, and he played football.

08:10.019 --> 08:11.240
He was a great football player.

08:11.260 --> 08:15.804
Everybody would have wanted him, but he had a bad shoulder or something.

08:15.924 --> 08:17.646
He decided he wasn't going to ever play football.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.247
He was going to run track.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.287
how I got him to go to East Texas.

08:21.788 --> 08:22.809
Nobody else knew that.

08:23.710 --> 08:31.060
Everybody thought he was going to play football, but he was Emory's coaching, but Emory knew how to, I'd go up there and visit with Emory.

08:31.300 --> 08:36.847
We were putting on a big track meet and he would tell me some things I'd do, you know, how he did this and how he did that.

08:36.927 --> 08:41.353
It was good to recruit him back and forth.

08:41.637 --> 09:00.921
I mean, he was for the track team and all of that, but he'd bring the football team out on, we may have a big track meet going on in spring, spring training, he'd bring the football team out and make the track team all sit down and be quiet while they worked out for an hour and a half, you know.

09:01.261 --> 09:07.729
That just killed your whole, you know, I can't imagine anybody doing that myself, but of course football is king B.

09:09.464 --> 09:12.788
And he had not yet met Tom Landry.

09:13.589 --> 09:15.011
That would change his life.

09:15.171 --> 09:17.054
I just thought, let's back up to Randy.

09:20.218 --> 09:30.491
Describe Randy throwing the shot put at Kyle Field for the last time wearing an Aggie uniform as an undergraduate.

09:30.731 --> 09:35.117
Well, that was, well, what we did the next year,

09:36.329 --> 09:39.938
They made a concrete, they made a real good shot put ring.

09:41.001 --> 09:42.625
And it took a tractor.

09:42.645 --> 09:47.537
We had to get a tractor to move that tractor out to the middle of the football field.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.232
They had such a big deal over that.

09:51.432 --> 09:57.805
Instead of them making them throw the shot put out in the country, they moved it on the middle of the football field.

09:57.825 --> 10:00.971
So anyway, he was getting ready to set the world record.

10:01.031 --> 10:04.799
And Meeks, SM Meeks was an equipment manager.

10:04.859 --> 10:06.522
He marked off everything.

10:06.502 --> 10:10.588
All right, he told me, he said, Charlie said, I got Randy Mattson's food.

10:12.230 --> 10:14.033
He said, I marked off his ring.

10:14.493 --> 10:22.405
And he said, I got the world record where he thinks he got throat to win the Southwest Conference or whatever, you know.

10:22.845 --> 10:26.951
He said, when he hits that line, he thinks it's just normal.

10:27.212 --> 10:29.996
But he said, he done broke the world record.

10:30.036 --> 10:31.918
I said, oh, you can't do that.

10:31.978 --> 10:34.542
He said, don't tell nobody, just between me and you.

10:34.582 --> 10:35.884
He said, Randy will never know.

10:35.864 --> 10:38.007
And sure enough, boom.

10:38.248 --> 10:39.550
I mean, he throws it out there.

10:40.531 --> 10:48.104
He set the world record.

10:48.124 --> 10:53.472
Do you remember saying anything special to Randy that day before he threw the truck?

10:53.492 --> 11:02.867
Were you aware that he was ready to... Well, I was aware he was ready to throw that good because in practice, we went out

11:03.556 --> 11:09.505
The week before, he didn't throw much during practice.

11:09.525 --> 11:12.049
He picked up the shot, and he throws one time.

11:12.069 --> 11:14.613
If it's a great throw, he'll only throw it once or twice.

11:14.653 --> 11:20.021
But he threw three times, and all three times broke the world record in practice.

11:20.402 --> 11:21.764
So I knew he was ready.

11:24.648 --> 11:25.069
Let's see.

11:25.329 --> 11:27.893
Before we leave the 60s and 70s,

11:33.526 --> 11:36.430
of coaching.

11:37.351 --> 11:42.097
When did track practice begin?

11:42.698 --> 11:53.391
In the fall you did the running, but when did y'all really get down to the events that each

11:53.759 --> 11:59.866
Well, we had everybody working out on the cross-country course.

12:01.047 --> 12:03.871
Later on, I hired Ted Nelson, and he hit me.

12:03.911 --> 12:13.862
But we would both coach on the cross-country course right in the grass, out in front of Kyle Field or on the highway coming in by the drill field.

12:14.503 --> 12:17.046
And every day, we'd have everybody to meet out there.

12:17.086 --> 12:22.332
And then we would mark off two 20-yard dashes or quarter-mile, and we'd have

12:22.312 --> 12:43.577
like high jumpers would run 10 or 15 repeat 220s and we had everybody running and just getting them in shape and we didn't do much field event practice because we couldn't because we had to coach cross country you know and I didn't feel like it I ought to go out there and

12:43.557 --> 12:49.925
during cross-country season, leave the cross-country team and go coach the high jump, I mean.

12:49.945 --> 12:56.694
So we'd make the field event guys or have them to come in early a lot of times or late.

12:56.874 --> 13:01.039
We'd work it out for at least one day a week we had to coach everybody.

13:01.059 --> 13:07.127
I mean, this is in September, October, November, you know, you got to get started on doing all that.

13:07.147 --> 13:13.395
You just had to work it out before you could do it all and it kept you busy from daylight to dark, you know.

13:14.506 --> 13:18.071
And this was five days or six days a week?

13:18.191 --> 13:19.853
Five days a week.

13:20.314 --> 13:31.388
Then during the winter, because indoor track was not given much emphasis then, how did they change in January or February?

13:32.269 --> 13:33.831
Describe the spring workouts.

13:34.165 --> 13:40.255
Well, that's when the indoor really started, and it started way back there.

13:42.118 --> 13:57.945
I remember Ted Nelson ran in the first indoor track meet, and we went to track meets back in those days where they would just be a flat concrete place, and they'd mark off things, and you had to run in tennis shoes.

13:57.925 --> 14:03.493
And Texas Tech, though, they bought a board track way back there.

14:03.513 --> 14:05.957
And they put on this meat out there in Lubbock.

14:06.457 --> 14:15.310
And they flew a plane around and picked up A&M, picked up Rice, and five or six teams.

14:15.779 --> 14:20.647
and flew them out to Lubbock, and we did that for four or five years, and that was way back there.

14:21.008 --> 14:28.701
And then we'd go over, in practice, we'd go over here to the horse, what do you call it, the little concrete building they got where they put on?

14:28.741 --> 14:29.502
Pavilion?

14:29.542 --> 14:30.003
Pavilion.

14:30.564 --> 14:35.492
And I'd get my, somebody would go in there with a tractor, and we'd grade that thing down,

14:35.978 --> 14:38.984
and even mark it off with line, mark off a little track.

14:39.024 --> 14:43.712
And it wasn't like 130 yards around that thing, you know, hard to sprint around it.

14:43.732 --> 14:46.317
But we worked out in it for several years.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.567
And then we'd also take a pole vault, set up a pole vault deal in there.

14:52.288 --> 14:59.742
And then when they built this new gym down there, new building on the highway, we went in there

15:00.481 --> 15:01.564
worked out every year.

15:01.905 --> 15:08.141
So we worked out indoors when it was, you know, just to learn how to run those short turns indoors.

15:08.161 --> 15:12.271
But Ted Nelson was one of the greatest runners I've ever had.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.958
Describe recruiting him.

15:15.379 --> 15:16.482
All right.

15:17.018 --> 15:20.527
The year before, I signed a guy named R.E.

15:20.567 --> 15:21.951
Merritt, all right.

15:23.013 --> 15:32.297
Andrews High School set the national record in the mile relay, and they won state in the 440 and the 880, and I mean, they were great.

15:32.538 --> 15:34.082
They were the best track people.

15:34.670 --> 15:37.693
in the United States or in the state of Texas.

15:38.273 --> 15:39.975
So I signed R.E.

15:39.995 --> 15:47.422
Merrick and he was, you know, get him down there and he was a senior and I wasn't thinking about Ted Nelson because R.E.

15:47.442 --> 15:48.823
was a stud then, you know.

15:49.384 --> 15:50.425
And then when I get R.E.

15:50.465 --> 15:59.874
down here, of course, Ted was running great and Ted ran 46-2, I believe, in high school and went out to the Coliseum Relays.

16:00.174 --> 16:03.377
You know, the Coliseum Relays are strictly Olympic type people.

16:03.357 --> 16:07.081
But Ted Nelson gets invited to go to the Coliseum Relay.

16:07.962 --> 16:13.667
And we go out there and watch him run and everything.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.469
And he gets second, third.

16:15.509 --> 16:18.532
But anyway, he's high caliber.

16:18.592 --> 16:24.038
And did you know his coach well?

16:24.458 --> 16:25.199
Oh, yes.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.321
Knew him real well.

16:27.401 --> 16:32.166
And then after Ted comes down here, Ted is such a great

16:33.412 --> 16:38.304
runner and knowing all about the high school coach was super.

16:38.324 --> 16:46.102
I mean, he come down here right now and he's been athletic supervisor for all the big track meets.

16:46.122 --> 16:50.593
He's been coaching in Dallas and he heads up all the big track meets in Dallas.

16:50.573 --> 16:58.289
And they invite him all over to be the head knocker for like Big 12 meets and Southwest Conference meets.

16:58.689 --> 17:03.740
He's been there with Southwest Conference meets in the last 30 years, being the, what do you call it, the head?

17:03.860 --> 17:07.267
The starter?

17:07.688 --> 17:08.890
No, the man who makes the rules.

17:09.692 --> 17:10.814
Oh.

17:10.834 --> 17:11.856
I don't know the thoughts.

17:12.207 --> 17:15.533
Well, if somebody gets disqualified, he's the one that does it, you know.

17:16.776 --> 17:24.811
But anyway, but going back to Ted, Ted held 13 A&M school records.

17:24.831 --> 17:33.388
And, I mean, he could run a hundred, he set the school record in 100 yard dash, 200 yard dash, 440, and then all the indoor races and things like that.

17:33.368 --> 17:40.557
So, Ted was so good and so knew how to train and so dedicated in workout.

17:40.657 --> 17:49.928
I mean, he would do a workout twice as hard is what I would suggest for somebody in a 220, you know, had different workouts for every event.

17:50.469 --> 17:56.997
So, after a while, I said, Ted, would you sit down and write down your whole workout?

17:56.977 --> 17:58.741
Workout for the mile relay.

17:58.821 --> 18:00.624
Workout for the 440 yard dash.

18:00.724 --> 18:01.947
Workout for the 220.

18:01.987 --> 18:03.029
He wrote all that down.

18:03.350 --> 18:08.520
Well, from that day on, I started using Ted Nelson's, my runner's workout.

18:09.181 --> 18:09.943
Hell, he knows more.

18:10.424 --> 18:11.305
I got thinking about it.

18:11.326 --> 18:12.388
Well, I was a sprinter.

18:12.408 --> 18:14.091
I ran 100 and 220, you know.

18:14.071 --> 18:16.614
And he ran a 440 in my relay.

18:16.694 --> 18:18.236
I didn't know how to train.

18:18.677 --> 18:21.020
I said, this guy's a whole lot better than me.

18:21.180 --> 18:23.043
So he must know more than me.

18:23.063 --> 18:25.987
So I started using Ted Nelson's workout system.

18:27.068 --> 18:32.315
Ted Nelson's deal was, I mean, he's sort of like Randy Mattson.

18:32.575 --> 18:37.682
I mean, big buddy, you better run like if you're running 10.

18:37.662 --> 18:42.008
repeat two 20s with a minute rest in between them.

18:42.348 --> 18:44.391
You don't get a minute and five seconds rest.

18:44.411 --> 18:45.913
You get one minute rest.

18:45.933 --> 18:53.444
And if you're, like in cross country, we run six repeat miles and 430 a mile and you get two minutes rest.

18:53.464 --> 18:59.312
See, in cross country, we had a roof where no one could stop for two hours.

19:00.593 --> 19:05.560
And the way they rested in between, like if they run, sometimes you run 10 repeat miles

19:06.350 --> 19:08.833
and have three minutes rest in between the miles.

19:08.853 --> 19:10.656
The way they would rest would be jogging.

19:10.676 --> 19:13.920
I mean, you could not sit down, you could not stop, stand still.

19:14.301 --> 19:20.109
And everybody, you'd have 15 or 20 guys jogging around and you'd be talking to them, you know, they'd ask you questions, but everybody's jogging.

19:21.110 --> 19:23.754
That's the first thing, distance runners cannot rest.

19:23.814 --> 19:27.059
I mean, they got to learn to run, you know, a long time.

19:29.762 --> 19:32.066
But anyway, Ted Nelson was great.

19:32.666 --> 19:35.310
And for an athlete as splendid as Ted,

19:35.594 --> 19:39.759
He's a little shorter than average, isn't he?

19:39.779 --> 19:40.400
Yes, uh-huh.

19:40.420 --> 19:41.762
But he was also stronger.

19:41.902 --> 19:52.996
I mean, he had big, strong legs, and it made him more powerful, which I think it helped him in the, especially in the 100 sprints, you know.

19:53.016 --> 19:59.244
A lot of the great sprinters are short, little people, you know, but they got big, strong muscles.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.285
Now, did you keep

20:02.223 --> 20:09.552
No, he went to, he got the assistant job at Bryan High School.

20:09.592 --> 20:22.268
He coached one year and he was assistant track coach at Bryan and then Marvin Tate got in and he was athletic director and I talked to Marvin.

20:22.429 --> 20:26.554
I told him I just had to have an assistant coach and somebody to hit me.

20:26.634 --> 20:29.918
I could do all this and so Marvin

20:30.893 --> 20:38.687
The first year he raised money, A&M paid for half of his salary.

20:39.769 --> 20:43.936
And he raised money through some Aggies to pay for the other half.

20:44.237 --> 20:47.623
That's how limited A&M was, you know, as far as money.

20:47.743 --> 20:50.488
I mean, we were skimping all the time.

20:51.481 --> 20:57.092
I think I told you that we had a roof where I couldn't invite but one guy in for a plane visit.

20:57.112 --> 21:06.891
Now when Jackie Sherrill, now you didn't ask me about Jackie Sherrill, but Jackie Sherrill comes in and he's the difference between daylight and dark.

21:06.871 --> 21:14.625
He calls a meeting of all coaches in all sports the very first day he's here.

21:15.447 --> 21:21.257
And Jackie Sherrill said, I want every sport to be number one.

21:22.059 --> 21:25.485
And he said, Charlie, he said, why don't you go to Jamaica?

21:25.505 --> 21:28.390
Why don't you go to Africa and recruit?

21:29.450 --> 21:31.473
And I said, Coach, I can't fly.

21:32.073 --> 21:32.814
I don't have any money.

21:32.834 --> 21:33.555
I can't make trips.

21:33.615 --> 21:37.721
He said, Charlie, you got an unlimited track budget now.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.404
He said, I want you to get out and recruit.

21:40.444 --> 21:42.287
You got to bring in some athletes.

21:42.307 --> 21:44.610
We want to build up this program.

21:45.291 --> 21:48.555
And I think maybe he told all the other coaches that too.

21:48.535 --> 21:51.538
I mean, it was altogether different for us.

21:52.799 --> 21:59.006
And he said, another thing, he said, I don't want the track team to ever stay in a rundown place.

21:59.026 --> 22:06.133
He said, you pick out the most expensive and the best hotels in town, and when you go somewhere, you stay in the best there is.

22:06.593 --> 22:13.260
He said, that's A&M's number one recruiting gimmick, is we travel like first class people.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.664
And it went from down here to up here.

22:16.446 --> 22:19.872
And then I sent somebody to Jamaica.

22:20.794 --> 22:21.736
I sent somebody.

22:22.176 --> 22:23.980
I mean, I didn't go.

22:24.681 --> 22:30.933
I sent somebody to Africa, an assistant that I hired.

22:31.975 --> 22:36.042
And Jackie Sherrill hired him and gave him a football.

22:37.422 --> 22:42.712
graduate assistant and all he had to do was be my assistant track coach.

22:42.732 --> 22:45.377
How long did that unlimited budget last?

22:45.397 --> 22:46.018
Till I left.

22:46.940 --> 22:47.441
Till?

22:47.461 --> 22:47.901
Uh-huh.

22:47.921 --> 22:48.442
Oh, really?

22:48.462 --> 22:49.404
Yeah.

22:49.424 --> 22:56.698
Did you have some, did you have some guidelines that you yourself practiced though about spending money and?

22:57.639 --> 22:59.042
No, I just used the same.

23:00.187 --> 23:01.708
I never spend any money much.

23:02.069 --> 23:04.872
Because you didn't stay at the best, you didn't stay at the highest price place.

23:04.932 --> 23:07.174
Well, we stayed, we always stayed at good hotels.

23:08.395 --> 23:08.655
Yeah.

23:08.675 --> 23:11.218
But, I mean, he just didn't want you to go to a bad place, you know.

23:11.238 --> 23:15.902
He wanted, he wanted us to have reputation of doing good.

23:16.103 --> 23:23.610
Now, when Jackie was the, officially the athletic director, who was the person on a day-to-day basis that you worked with?

23:26.653 --> 23:28.675
Because he wasn't available, I'm sure, all the time.

23:28.958 --> 23:30.379
No, uh-uh.

23:30.399 --> 23:32.741
Who would you turn to to get a question and answer?

23:32.761 --> 23:33.682
Well, Wally Gross.

23:33.702 --> 23:34.403
Wally?

23:35.464 --> 23:35.744
Uh-huh.

23:35.784 --> 23:41.389
Wally was all, now Wally, I want to recommend Wally, too, because Wally has stepped up.

23:42.110 --> 23:45.093
I mean, he's made everything first class.

23:45.213 --> 23:48.616
It was Jackie and Wally together, really, because.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.778
Wally was at that time officially the business.

23:51.078 --> 23:51.759
Yeah, uh-huh.

23:52.339 --> 23:57.004
All right, when Cheryl left, who followed him as athletic director?

23:57.024 --> 23:58.425
Does Wally move up about then?

23:59.384 --> 24:00.866
I believe that's when he moved up.

24:02.028 --> 24:02.128
Okay.

24:02.148 --> 24:08.718
But we always went to Wally's office all the time for everybody.

24:08.838 --> 24:12.824
I mean, Wally knew all the rules, how much money you had and all that.

24:12.924 --> 24:14.046
He took care of all that.

24:14.226 --> 24:15.488
Now, you retired in what year?

24:16.389 --> 24:17.871
In 90, 1990.

24:19.213 --> 24:27.125
In the late, in the 80s, Cheryl and on up to, how often did the entire athletic department get together?

24:27.185 --> 24:28.547
How often did the coaches have meetings?

24:29.219 --> 24:31.422
We didn't, I don't think we had any more.

24:31.442 --> 24:36.989
Well, we had a coaching meeting where it was on campus.

24:37.289 --> 24:38.371
I mean, it wasn't for the family.

24:38.391 --> 24:40.053
It was just.

24:40.073 --> 24:43.998
No, but the athletic department coaches, you all didn't meet once a month or once a week?

24:45.600 --> 24:52.770
How did you know whether or not the athletic director thought you were succeeding?

24:54.712 --> 24:57.015
What kind of feedback did you get?

24:58.244 --> 25:05.591
Well, we, a lot of times we'd have recruits that we would both try to recruit, you know.

25:06.592 --> 25:27.053
Jackie is, the first one we recruited, black guy out of Houston that was a stud, and we got him down here, but he hurts his leg, and he never did do real good, but he was, he was, he was sort of like Curtis Dickey type guy, you know, he was, he was real good, but anyway, Jackie would

25:28.113 --> 25:36.263
talk to you about him and, you know, I'd take guys in to visit with him and he'd get me to talk to their guys, stuff like that.

25:37.525 --> 25:46.817
Throughout all of those years that you were the head coach, do you remember the athletic director ever calling you in and saying, hey, don't do that, don't do this?

25:47.918 --> 25:48.119
Uh-uh.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.264
Well, Gene Stallings was the only one who ever said don't do anything.

25:52.430 --> 25:57.115
And like one time, I was sitting down at a track meet.

25:58.176 --> 26:01.300
And he kind of jumped on me about sitting down.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.022
Coaches need to stand up, you know.

26:03.242 --> 26:06.926
And one time, Tom Chandler had a baseball game.

26:06.946 --> 26:07.567
He was leaving.

26:07.787 --> 26:09.850
He was walking across pulling a bat.

26:10.891 --> 26:14.615
Just, you know, he jumped on him about pulling that bat.

26:15.396 --> 26:17.138
And then he gets on me.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.319
See, I'm his trainer.

26:18.704 --> 26:21.548
for football, for five football games.

26:21.768 --> 26:23.070
I'm his head, I'm his trainer.

26:23.611 --> 26:24.873
All right, he was number one.

26:25.854 --> 26:28.418
He had three studs, I can't even remember, the quarterback.

26:28.759 --> 26:30.862
They went to conference, football.

26:31.402 --> 26:33.866
All right, he had this tall thing up there.

26:33.906 --> 26:36.209
You know, he'd get up there.

26:36.229 --> 26:38.012
He hired, Carpenter, Johnny, come up here.

26:38.363 --> 26:40.566
Well, I started walking up, you know, climbing up.

26:40.626 --> 26:41.507
He said, I said, come here.

26:41.587 --> 26:45.052
Boy, I had to go up there like a butt, you know, and get up there.

26:45.652 --> 26:49.677
You see, he called me up there two or three times, kind of chewed me out.

26:49.698 --> 26:51.099
I'd call it chewing it out, you know.

26:51.940 --> 26:57.728
But the deal was two of his star football players got hurt.

26:58.729 --> 27:01.713
Well, I sent them into the training room, you know.

27:02.113 --> 27:05.738
They wasn't capable of playing football, so he jumped on me.

27:06.173 --> 27:09.437
Not really jumping on me, but really serious.

27:09.937 --> 27:11.038
Why did you send so-and-so in?

27:11.379 --> 27:15.043
I said, Coach, he's got a sprained ankle or hurt his shoulder.

27:15.063 --> 27:17.465
I said, he may be able to come back out.

27:17.826 --> 27:19.467
He said, you sure about that?

27:19.567 --> 27:20.288
I said, yeah.

27:20.308 --> 27:21.890
I said, you don't want him to be out for the whole year.

27:22.030 --> 27:24.773
I said, you send that guy out there right now and he gets hurt.

27:24.813 --> 27:27.476
I said, he's out for the whole year, not just for an hour or two.

27:27.576 --> 27:28.777
He said, OK.

27:29.238 --> 27:30.159
Little deals like that.

27:32.221 --> 27:34.864
During all of those years that you were the head coach,

27:35.857 --> 27:42.232
What were your personal guidelines or rules that you yourself tried to practice?

27:43.836 --> 27:48.326
What did you, what kind of plan did you follow?

27:48.848 --> 27:51.975
Well, just never, I'm always early.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.783
Never be late.

27:54.324 --> 27:59.889
Out of all my 40 years of traveling and coaching, I was always early.

28:00.009 --> 28:04.874
If I was going to meet somebody like a prospect, I was going to visit them.

28:05.254 --> 28:07.396
If I said 3 o'clock, well, I'd be there at 2.

28:08.377 --> 28:11.180
And I'd go in, drink coffee.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.681
Anyway, I was always early.

28:12.721 --> 28:15.444
I'd never late for anything, just like going to work.

28:15.504 --> 28:18.587
If I was supposed to be there at 8 o'clock, I'd be there at 10 minutes to 8, you know.

28:19.507 --> 28:21.169
And it started like that.

28:21.233 --> 28:27.382
If a member of the track team was late, what punishment did you give in?

28:27.402 --> 28:29.204
Well, I just kind of overlooked it.

28:29.345 --> 28:32.770
I mean, they didn't mean too much.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.793
All right, other guidelines for you.

28:34.833 --> 28:42.383
What about, did you ever, if you were trying to chew a kid out, if you were trying to get him to do better, how did you?

28:44.206 --> 28:48.372
Well, I've had quite a few of those things.

28:49.769 --> 28:59.764
Not really, but the main thing is we used to go on, if they didn't do so good, I mean, you're coming in on, say, a half scholarship.

29:00.365 --> 29:01.447
We'd have it kind of lined up.

29:01.607 --> 29:04.692
If you go uphill, we'd give you more money.

29:05.173 --> 29:07.176
If you go downhill, we'd cut your scholarship.

29:08.057 --> 29:11.382
All right, where I got in trouble over that was when I took over the women.

29:12.764 --> 29:15.388
And I tried to coach the women like I coached the men.

29:15.549 --> 29:18.493
Well, that's a little bit different there.

29:21.140 --> 29:39.483
Well, there were some girls on the team that I recruited and they come in and I found out after a little while that all the girls would gain about eight or ten to fifteen pounds in about three or four weeks or a month.

29:40.585 --> 29:44.630
I don't know what the deal was but it was their age and the changes, you know.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.615
So I put in a rule that all

29:49.237 --> 29:50.999
Well, everybody, we had that roof, everybody.

29:51.119 --> 29:57.685
Every Monday, I believe it was Monday, everybody had to weigh, and I had a chart there.

29:58.425 --> 30:01.889
Well, after a while, the girls, some of the girls, they quit weighing.

30:02.549 --> 30:08.294
And I'd get on to one of them, and I mean, they'd just say, Coach, I'll never be weighed.

30:08.395 --> 30:10.156
I'll never do that.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.618
Well, you know, what am I going to do now, you know?

30:12.759 --> 30:13.339
I can't.

30:13.359 --> 30:14.680
Am I going to kick her off to any coach?

30:14.700 --> 30:16.482
You won't weigh, you know?

30:16.502 --> 30:17.623
Little things like that.

30:17.603 --> 30:27.378
But you just kind of overlook some things, and I find out that, you know, the girls are going to gain weight.

30:27.398 --> 30:32.806
But anyway, several of those girls, I would cut down a little bit off the scholarship because they were getting slower.

30:32.866 --> 30:35.289
I said, you can't gain 20 pounds and run faster.

30:35.329 --> 30:38.895
If you're going to run faster, you've got to lose 25 pounds, you know.

30:39.335 --> 30:41.839
And that didn't dawn on them to start with.

30:43.169 --> 30:51.751
And then when I, I don't know what the other track coach did, but they only scored one or two points in two years.

30:52.593 --> 30:55.120
And see, I had 16 full scholarships.

30:55.522 --> 30:56.483
And the women had 21.

30:58.084 --> 30:59.245
And they scored two points.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.169
And John David fired him.

31:03.189 --> 31:04.230
So he called.

31:05.591 --> 31:13.458
I might not already tell you this, but John David called me up there and said, just fired the track coach.

31:13.478 --> 31:15.500
He said, I want you and Ted to take over.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.642
He said, will you be interested in taking over?

31:17.662 --> 31:19.644
I said, yeah.

31:19.664 --> 31:22.506
You know, I could just see him getting a big raise, man.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.908
I'm going to take over the women's program.

31:23.928 --> 31:25.309
I'm going to get a big raise.

31:25.289 --> 31:28.785
He said, would you be interested in taking over the women?
