WEBVTT

00:03.541 --> 00:06.984
three testing to see that the machine is working.

00:08.946 --> 00:12.009
This is Tuesday, March the third.

00:12.950 --> 00:19.216
And we're in Bryan in the office of the Chamber of Commerce with Royce Hickman, class of 64.

00:19.476 --> 00:20.618
Correct.

00:20.638 --> 00:24.021
And where was home then?

00:24.121 --> 00:31.388
When I came to school, home was in the process of moving from the Los Angeles area to Alabama.

00:31.408 --> 00:33.430
So my father was a construction engineer.

00:33.578 --> 00:36.922
So you finished high school in Los Angeles?

00:36.942 --> 00:37.382
In Los Angeles.

00:37.402 --> 00:41.106
Graduated from high school in Montobello, California, out on the east side of Los Angeles.

00:41.366 --> 00:41.707
All right.

00:41.727 --> 00:43.989
Then that leads to the first important question.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.812
What led you to come to A&M in the first place?

00:46.832 --> 00:47.293
Why here?

00:47.473 --> 00:48.554
I was born in Bryan.

00:49.635 --> 00:53.600
I had my grandmother, my mother's mother live right across the street from the campus.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.983
Managed an apartment house for 40 plus years there.

00:58.485 --> 01:03.130
Down from where old Blue Post used to be, about two blocks.

01:03.329 --> 01:08.053
Fitzwillies or something like that's the name of the place that's there now.

01:09.074 --> 01:18.783
And I used to come, I lived here until I was about a year probably, or a little less than a year old than me, but I'd come back here and spend summers of, you know, a week or two with my grandparents.

01:18.803 --> 01:22.227
So I was somewhat raised.

01:22.247 --> 01:23.588
Might be a way of saying that.

01:23.608 --> 01:26.531
I mean, we came back for football games.

01:26.551 --> 01:31.395
I'm kind of your typical, you know, raised as an actor.

01:31.763 --> 01:33.546
I don't ever remember not being an Aggie.

01:33.566 --> 01:34.789
Isn't that interesting?

01:35.089 --> 01:35.750
That's a good one.

01:35.810 --> 01:38.776
Yeah, and that's true.

01:38.836 --> 01:40.840
I don't ever remember not being an Aggie.

01:41.200 --> 01:47.011
My dad took some classes here, engineering classes, but he never graduated.

01:47.292 --> 01:48.955
He was a pretty well self-educated man.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.818
He didn't finish eighth grade.

01:51.102 --> 01:56.609
Got his GED and took some courses here from Arkansas and Texas Tech.

01:56.649 --> 01:58.771
A lot of correspondence courses on it.

01:58.791 --> 01:59.832
Made himself an engineer.

02:00.253 --> 02:02.596
So, we moved all of the United States.

02:02.616 --> 02:06.360
I've probably been in 44 of the 50 states at one time or another.

02:07.141 --> 02:11.166
Alright, when you came to begin your freshman year, that was the fall of 50?

02:12.247 --> 02:14.770
Well, that was the fall of 60, wasn't it?

02:16.152 --> 02:16.452
Yeah.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.947
Yeah, let me just give you a quick deal here.

02:20.047 --> 02:22.491
I graduated in 1959 from high school.

02:24.333 --> 02:30.421
And actually, even though I wanted to come to A&M, I just didn't, you know, like a lot of kids, I used to have my everything together.

02:30.922 --> 02:46.202
I played football at Montebello and had been asked to come over and play football for Pasadena City College, which was a two-year school there.

02:46.705 --> 02:55.579
I played one year of football and tore up an ankle and realized I was too small at 150 pounds to be playing with those 265, 275 guys.

02:56.641 --> 03:04.714
And when the year ended, I was in the process of going back for my second year there when my dad was transferred to Dothan, Alabama.

03:05.395 --> 03:09.322
And we had no family in California and he wasn't wild about leaving me out there.

03:09.963 --> 03:12.747
And he gave me a choice of either coming back to

03:13.520 --> 03:19.108
going to Alabama with him, working a semester and going to school there locally, or coming to A&M.

03:19.128 --> 03:22.472
And I said, well, Dan always wanted to go to A&M, you know, let's go.

03:23.353 --> 03:28.740
So, he put me on an airplane and sent me to school here.

03:29.021 --> 03:31.524
Alright, you say on an airplane?

03:31.604 --> 03:31.905
Yeah.

03:32.125 --> 03:37.712
Alright, and so, but did you, you didn't come on an airplane to Bryan College Station?

03:37.733 --> 03:38.173
Yeah, I did.

03:38.193 --> 03:38.574
Really?

03:38.594 --> 03:40.376
Yeah, Trans-Texas Airlines.

03:40.737 --> 03:40.977
Trans-Texas?

03:40.997 --> 03:41.097
Yeah.

03:41.380 --> 03:45.767
Because imagine the comparison we would have with... PC-3s, if you remember those.

03:47.089 --> 03:49.493
Tell me what you brought physically.

03:49.533 --> 03:54.060
What was the quantity of stuff you brought when you arrived?

03:54.121 --> 03:59.048
I brought a suitcase with just some clothes in it.

03:59.850 --> 04:04.958
And, you know, Haskell, I don't remember having anything else with me.

04:05.815 --> 04:12.461
in the way of lamps or any of those things, not coming in a vehicle.

04:13.062 --> 04:14.744
I didn't have that opportunity.

04:14.764 --> 04:26.795
Now, my folks came through a couple of weeks later, maybe I lost track of time, two or three weeks later, they came back on their way to Dauphin, Alabama for his new assignment there.

04:27.596 --> 04:33.021
And I actually owned an old, gosh,

04:33.997 --> 04:51.712
Ford and they drove that here so I was one of the few freshmen that had a car and when they came then they brought some extra things but when I walked on that campus I had a suitcase of clothes and I don't think I really had anything else.

04:53.534 --> 05:04.003
You know I went over and my mother and dad had been friends of Lupo and Evelyn Lupo which was his first wife that died some years ago and we spent

05:04.321 --> 05:12.834
And Lou actually took me over to the registrar's office and got me, because school had already been, at that time, they'd already been going to school a week.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.839
Alright, now how did you get from the, was it Easterwood?

05:15.979 --> 05:18.082
Yeah, my grandmother picked me up.

05:18.122 --> 05:19.024
She picked you up?

05:19.204 --> 05:20.746
Yeah, she lived here.

05:20.987 --> 05:30.261
She lived here, I had some cousins that lived here, and two great aunts, great uncles and their wives, which were my grandmother's brothers.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.851
One of them was Garland Brown that had Brown Allen Oldsmobile Cadillac for years.

05:33.891 --> 05:40.453
And the other one was Frank Brown, Junior, who for years was an electrician on campus.

05:40.872 --> 05:42.033
Came here in the 20s.

05:42.654 --> 05:48.161
Been a member of my family living in this community for 80 years consecutively.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.963
Right now you said you were about a week late.

05:50.304 --> 05:50.905
Yeah.

05:50.925 --> 05:55.931
Okay, tell me about getting settled in on the campus or wherever you lived.

05:55.971 --> 06:01.478
Well, I had a cousin who was a junior in the Corps.

06:02.359 --> 06:06.724
And he, when I came, his name was Glenn Morton.

06:07.265 --> 06:09.748
He was a class of 60.

06:11.247 --> 06:12.829
Gosh, what is that, 62?

06:14.131 --> 06:21.760
And after I was enrolled in class, and all of my hours wouldn't transfer.

06:21.820 --> 06:26.006
I transferred about, I don't know, 24 hours, 20 something hours.

06:27.147 --> 06:34.977
But, you know, he actually talked me into entering the Corps as a freshman and not trying to, you know,

06:35.277 --> 06:42.607
I guess, I didn't even really, even though I'd been semi-raced on this campus, I really didn't understand that part of it.

06:43.108 --> 06:48.476
So I came in as a freshman in the Corps and into his unit.

06:48.836 --> 06:55.446
He went down with me and got me put into his unit and then I moved into, at that time it was dorm 14.

06:55.466 --> 07:02.095
I think that's Moses, if I'm not mistaken, but back then we called it by numbers.

07:02.446 --> 07:07.471
And so I moved into dorm 14 in an outfit that was H1 at the time.

07:07.491 --> 07:10.334
Did it have a nickname?

07:10.434 --> 07:12.416
They called it Hotel Company or something.

07:13.677 --> 07:19.362
The next year, the same outfit's designation was changed to G2, which was Gallant and Bold.

07:19.382 --> 07:23.686
But we never had Dog Company or any of those designations like so many of the others.

07:23.726 --> 07:27.790
Did it have a particular relationship to any branch of the owner?

07:27.810 --> 07:28.451
Yeah, engineers.

07:28.511 --> 07:30.613
It was old B Company engineers.

07:30.863 --> 07:33.826
And virtually everybody was in there was an engineer.

07:34.587 --> 07:40.573
I was a history major when I first started there.

07:41.634 --> 07:44.277
The one year I'd been out in California, I was a liberal arts major.

07:44.337 --> 07:45.358
I changed to history.

07:46.219 --> 07:49.562
And I was about the only non-engineer in that outfit.

07:49.743 --> 07:53.747
And these guys were struggling with calculus and all these other courses.

07:53.807 --> 07:58.812
And I really couldn't relate to them because I wasn't taking anything like that.

07:59.298 --> 08:01.942
And gosh, they were flunking out right and left.

08:01.962 --> 08:13.258
We had about close to, seemed like close to 50 freshmen that first semester and I think there were about 19 come back the second semester.

08:13.399 --> 08:14.520
I mean we lost a ton of freshmen.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.745
Plus the outfit was, they were extremely hard on freshmen.

08:18.181 --> 08:22.607
They were easy on sophomores, but boy, the freshman year was different.

08:22.827 --> 08:29.456
Tell me about what it was like to be a freshman then in terms of core life and hazing and whatever other words we might want to use.

08:30.117 --> 08:46.939
You know, it's funny because as much as I love this school and as much as I've given back to it really so gladly and so thrilled to have the opportunity to give back and blessed for that.

08:47.240 --> 09:00.994
I can remember driving down Highway 6 on Gray, on Gray, you know, Gray Avenue and saying, gosh, I hate this place, you know, because the first semester was really tough.

09:01.074 --> 09:07.200
I went back home and talked about transferring to Auburn University with my folks living in Alabama.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.523
And my dad said, you know, he wouldn't hear of it.

09:09.543 --> 09:11.965
He said, you're going to finish your first year out and then we'll talk.

09:12.350 --> 09:17.777
And I'll come back to the first part of that year, but I came back that second semester with a different attitude.

09:18.337 --> 09:19.198
And it's really interesting.

09:19.218 --> 09:26.387
I really love my second semester of my freshman year because I came looking for the good things.

09:26.447 --> 09:33.055
I think the first semester you were always looking for that sophomore that was going to get on you.

09:33.095 --> 09:34.897
You know, you were almost anticipating it.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.982
Life as a freshman was getting up in the morning and

09:39.670 --> 09:44.576
a lot of times getting your, being the whistle jock, getting your outfit up.

09:44.957 --> 09:45.898
What time?

09:46.118 --> 09:48.882
Gosh, you know, I don't remember, about 6.30 is what I recall.

09:49.523 --> 09:52.306
And we'd fall out for a formation and march to chow.

09:52.326 --> 09:53.388
We ate in Sebesa Hall.

09:54.269 --> 10:02.980
And, you know, you'd always have to, you either ironed your uniform the night before you got up early, set your alarm, got up and ironed your uniform.

10:03.421 --> 10:04.502
You'd stay in inspection.

10:04.522 --> 10:06.525
Every time you had a formation, you'd stay in inspection.

10:06.545 --> 10:09.188
And the sophomores had a certain amount of time to,

10:09.505 --> 10:16.031
yell at you about your grass being dirty or your gig line crooked or your shirt wrinkled or, you know, did you sleep in your uniform?

10:16.091 --> 10:20.094
Another line, I had kind of a heavy beard and it was tough to use an electric razor.

10:20.114 --> 10:25.418
Anytime I'd use one by noon or early on, they'd say, did you shave this morning, Fish Eggman?

10:25.438 --> 10:25.859
Yes, sir.

10:26.639 --> 10:28.101
Next time, use a blade.

10:28.161 --> 10:32.464
You know, I mean, that was always the lines that you weren't really, weren't really shaving.

10:33.225 --> 10:37.068
And those guys, you know, did you sleep in your uniform last night?

10:37.088 --> 10:39.090
That was the standard line for

10:39.408 --> 10:42.771
if your uniform was wrinkled.

10:44.853 --> 10:49.558
And, I mean, it'd be nothing for them to have you down on the ground doing push-ups or things like that.

10:49.598 --> 10:58.347
I'd say anything that went on in that regard was more in the open would be more push-ups or running.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.227
They'd run you some.

10:59.267 --> 11:08.296
We didn't run near like they run today in units, but we stole our CO's footlocker, which is kind of a tradition, you know.

11:08.436 --> 11:09.077
Tell me about that.

11:09.496 --> 11:11.738
Well... When and how?

11:11.758 --> 11:39.503
We stole it in the fall and we got a passkey somehow and when he was at formation eating, we snuck back a couple of my fish buddies, I wasn't one of them, but they snuck back into his room and just opened it up with a passkey and got his footlocker and then he took us out and ran us.

11:39.989 --> 11:41.751
He was a cross country.

11:42.051 --> 11:43.412
Did he know who had done it?

11:43.533 --> 11:44.894
Or was he just guessing?

11:44.914 --> 11:50.239
No, he was a pretty good guess at the fish class that stole his footlocker.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.822
So he ran us.

11:53.022 --> 11:58.267
He was an intramural cross country champion and he just said, well I need to get in shape anyway, let's go run guys.

11:59.128 --> 12:04.633
And I had played football and I was in reasonably good shape.

12:04.673 --> 12:09.338
Plus I worked summers in construction work, labor work, and at that time I was in

12:09.537 --> 12:10.998
much better shape than I'm in now.

12:11.799 --> 12:19.186
And gosh I was having to try to catch up with the guys in the front to get them to kind of run slower.

12:19.206 --> 12:38.683
I mean it wasn't, you know this was the old freshman stick together bit because some of our fish buddies were dragging along the road throwing up and dying you know and some of these guys were out there trying to keep up with this guy and I said you know here the idea is we need to be trying to run as a class and run as slow as the slowest one can go.

12:39.305 --> 12:44.630
But the CO caught me doing that, and he wasn't too thrilled that I was trying to slow everybody down.

12:46.812 --> 12:56.620
But he ran us until we finally told him he could have his footlocker back, and he quit running us, but then we didn't give it back to him until we had a Christmas party, an outfit Christmas party.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.801
So you had it about how long?

12:58.162 --> 13:00.604
Oh gosh, we probably had it six to eight weeks.

13:01.465 --> 13:06.829
And y'all didn't do anything to it except hide?

13:06.849 --> 13:06.909
No.

13:06.929 --> 13:07.590
Where did you hide it?

13:07.807 --> 13:08.768
You know, I don't remember.

13:08.808 --> 13:11.511
I honestly don't remember where we had that thing off campus.

13:11.952 --> 13:18.560
You know, a lot of times when we'd hide anything or do that, my grandmother's apartment building was across the street, and that's where I parked my car.

13:19.121 --> 13:26.009
So things would get hidden over there sometime, but I don't remember, I don't think I had that footlocker.

13:26.389 --> 13:35.080
In the freshman haze, let's call it, was there any physical punishment applied by sophomores or others?

13:35.100 --> 13:35.400
Yeah.

13:35.819 --> 13:37.662
When and how often?

13:38.764 --> 13:49.803
Well, the big thing as far as like a paddle or anything was, you know, they would beat your handle off, which you know, your handle was fish.

13:50.404 --> 13:58.377
And if a sophomore wanted to drop handles with you, sometimes that's the method they would use to drop handles with you.

13:58.397 --> 13:59.599
They'd give you a whack.

14:00.018 --> 14:06.308
And then from then on, if you were not around juniors or seniors, you could call them Bob or George or whatever.

14:07.290 --> 14:12.919
And because they'd ask you what your first name was and it was always Fish.

14:13.760 --> 14:23.916
And you know, every once in a while you'd think they were going to drop handles with you and you'd say, well it's Royce, and they pretty quickly informed you that was not correct.

14:24.318 --> 14:30.065
Most of the physical hazing that we went through was, from my standpoint, was push-ups.

14:30.586 --> 14:36.914
I had a friend, a guy that I could develop a friendship with and I regret, I could go back and look at my hand, but I don't recall his name.

14:37.274 --> 14:40.798
He was in the room right next to me and we just kind of hit it off.

14:41.760 --> 14:52.553
And he, I don't know, he upset an upperclassman one time and so he spent the weekend signing in on his door.

14:53.545 --> 15:17.713
sheet up there and he had to every hour on the hour he had to sign in and whenever he signed in he had to be in a different uniform and so you know it'd be class A with rain gear or class B or class you know C and with a jacket and you could change it up more than you think you could but whenever he'd he'd always have his door open

15:18.250 --> 15:24.699
So he would have to actually knock on the door and ask permission to come in the room to sign once he got in that room.

15:26.221 --> 15:44.646
The one thing I remember he telling me about that I thought was really stupid is they would have him running in a circle around, we used to have single light bulbs in those rooms and he had a broom and he would hold that broom up and run around in circles around that light bulb while they had another broom trying to trip him.

15:45.031 --> 15:52.100
A lot of the things that we thought we were being hazed for, and I think that's when I really, that really helped me.

15:52.781 --> 15:55.564
My second semester, all of a sudden I realized that we weren't really hazing.

15:56.265 --> 16:00.230
I used to, at one stage, I remember considering it hazing, I had to speak to everybody.

16:00.590 --> 16:03.333
But what a better world we'd live in if everybody spoke to everybody.

16:04.114 --> 16:07.238
And, you know, we used to consider it a hassle to have to whip out to people.

16:07.258 --> 16:11.123
You know, we'd pass a sophomore that we knew, and we'd say, howdy, Mr. Jones, sir.

16:11.423 --> 16:15.126
And then we'd have to introduce ourselves to his three sophomore buddies that were there with him.

16:15.567 --> 16:16.828
Well, Kim, what a great world.

16:16.908 --> 16:19.430
Everybody introduced themselves to each other and things like that.

16:20.071 --> 16:23.854
My second semester, I really accepted that that was all good.

16:25.115 --> 16:40.249
My first semester, I probably lived in, you know, I can remember walking across the street to avoid meeting people or seeing a sophomore, I should know his name, and I didn't.

16:40.921 --> 16:47.229
I remember one time, embarrassed to say, walking across the street to avoid saluting an officer.

16:48.230 --> 16:53.036
And I don't know why, but that's the mentality I was in at that time, avoidance, so to speak.

16:53.697 --> 17:02.408
And a real statement that I made to myself was, I was walking down the street that second semester, and there was a military officer walking on the other side of the street.

17:02.428 --> 17:07.195
I walked across the street so I could salute him, and then walked back across the street.

17:07.695 --> 17:09.898
And it's funny, I remember that.

17:10.385 --> 17:19.719
But that, as much as anything, was a statement to myself, I guess, that, you know, that this is different and this is all, yeah, yeah, the heart.

17:20.640 --> 17:27.991
But, and to be honest with my second semester, I don't remember being very difficult.

17:28.011 --> 17:35.541
Our first semester was a pretty difficult lot of, I mean, just sophomores in your face yelling at you all the time.

17:35.582 --> 17:40.088
And again, you know, it's verbal, I wouldn't call it,

17:40.388 --> 17:44.514
I wouldn't call it abuse or anything, but it was a form of hazing.

17:45.695 --> 17:52.665
You got to the point you're afraid to do anything because they'd be all over you.

17:52.785 --> 17:54.727
That's their job to shape the freshman up.

17:54.768 --> 17:57.191
That's what they always were, had that responsibility.

17:57.872 --> 18:00.696
Was your official lady a special person?

18:00.816 --> 18:03.579
His name, I still see him.

18:03.599 --> 18:05.762
I saw him this year at a mini reunion.

18:05.782 --> 18:07.284
His name was Chris Anthone.

18:07.865 --> 18:09.147
Chris was from Houston.

18:09.413 --> 18:18.004
and Chris was an engineering major that ended up changing to business after a semester or two and Chris was a good guy.

18:20.126 --> 18:22.870
We didn't have an awful lot in common but we got along well.

18:23.631 --> 18:38.830
I changed roommates after my first year and it wasn't so much because I didn't care for Chris as much as I developed a real strong relationship with a guy from San Antonio by the name of Bill Parker and part of the relationship with Bill that

18:39.552 --> 18:44.596
made it even stronger was he tried to get me to go to San Antonio on a free weekend.

18:45.297 --> 18:58.729
We had a, you have a free weekend, back then we drilled on Saturday mornings, so if you went anywhere it was noon Saturday and you had to be back, I think we had to be back around 6 Sunday evening, so your weekends were really short.

18:59.349 --> 19:04.454
And we had a free weekend which meant we had no drill and you could leave Friday whenever class was over.

19:05.174 --> 19:09.238
And he wanted me to go to San Antonio with him, well my folks live in Alabama so I couldn't go there.

19:09.623 --> 19:10.844
And I had relatives here.

19:10.904 --> 19:14.107
I was just going to stay here and enjoy life, so to speak.

19:14.127 --> 19:19.492
And he could not stand the thought of me being in the dorm that was basically him because everybody left on those weekends.

19:20.072 --> 19:27.098
And he bugged me so much, I finally said, if you get me a date with a good-looking girl with a great personality, I'll go to San Antonio with you.

19:27.118 --> 19:34.004
So he called his girlfriend in San Antonio, and he called me back like the Thursday before the Friday we were leaving.

19:34.024 --> 19:35.826
He called and said, I've got you a date.

19:36.766 --> 19:38.668
And that's her picture right over there.

19:40.775 --> 19:42.396
So it worked.

19:42.937 --> 19:44.178
Been married 35 years.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.421
Love at first sight.

19:47.661 --> 19:51.664
And so Bill and I... And you're a freshman at that point?

19:51.684 --> 19:52.685
I was a freshman, uh-huh.

19:53.446 --> 19:59.691
And Bill, you know, I mean, that kind of seemed in a relationship if a guy introduces you to a special lady, you know.

20:00.251 --> 20:02.533
But so my next year I ran with Bill.

20:02.974 --> 20:04.915
And then my junior year I ran with Mary.

20:06.357 --> 20:10.360
We married them my sophomore year and spent two years married on campus.

20:10.576 --> 20:15.082
Anyway, you were asking about my freshman, my fish old lady.

20:15.382 --> 20:20.108
Chris was a guy that was kind of clumsy at times.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.152
Don't put that in a book.

20:23.172 --> 20:24.714
I'm trying to describe that.

20:24.814 --> 20:30.221
Chris was one of, I'll tell you, Chris worked hard at being an Aggie.

20:30.241 --> 20:33.225
And it didn't come naturally for him.

20:34.186 --> 20:36.269
And I remember he was a whistle jock one morning.

20:37.190 --> 20:39.553
And Chris got up like

20:39.770 --> 20:44.756
Gosh almighty, you know, he's supposed to start blowing the whistle at, say, 6.30, whatever the hours were then.

20:45.717 --> 20:48.841
And he probably got up about 5.

20:50.403 --> 20:57.732
And he's driving me crazy because he's got the lights on and he's all, and then you had to go out there and recite the menu.

20:57.812 --> 20:59.955
So he's practicing reciting the menu.

21:00.340 --> 21:12.062
He's got his uniform iron, he irons his uniform, got it spiffy, looking great, and he's waking me up to say, listen, see if I got the menu right, and I'm getting, you know, he's reading the menu, yes, Chris, you got it down pat.

21:12.082 --> 21:18.194
Well, Chris, he's got it all ready, okay, so he sits down for just a minute, okay, falls asleep.

21:19.496 --> 21:23.243
So, all of a sudden, we're awakened by this sophomore, junior,

21:23.695 --> 21:24.978
bursting into our room.

21:25.399 --> 21:27.424
Fish anthem, aren't you the whistle jock?

21:27.444 --> 21:27.785
Yes, sir.

21:27.946 --> 21:29.028
Well, where are you?

21:29.048 --> 21:31.033
Well, I'm waiting to get first call.

21:31.053 --> 21:32.898
He said, well, first call was 10 minutes ago.

21:32.938 --> 21:35.023
You better get us out.

21:35.043 --> 21:38.211
He goes out and gets the first call.

21:38.444 --> 21:43.631
Then within just minutes he's out giving second call and then within minutes he's giving third call.

21:43.651 --> 21:49.739
And then all the sophomores are griping at him and they're in his face because he didn't give them enough time to get ready.

21:49.940 --> 21:56.068
But that's typical story of Chris working so hard at it.

21:56.649 --> 22:05.481
And so Chris took a lot of verbal abuse and he was not in the best physical condition in the world.

22:06.018 --> 22:07.541
I'm not saying he was in bad shape.

22:07.561 --> 22:11.848
So, like, I mean, I used to do 60 push-ups a night every night falling to bed.

22:11.928 --> 22:17.056
And whenever our classmen asked me to do one, I'd start straining at 20 like it was killing me.

22:17.697 --> 22:21.604
But Chris, you know, he'd really be straining at 15 push-ups maybe.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.988
But Chris stuck it out.

22:24.128 --> 22:25.530
And I always respect him for that.

22:25.550 --> 22:28.716
I mean, because a lot of guys that went through less quit.

22:29.377 --> 22:30.999
And Chris just refused to quit.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.101
All right.

22:32.201 --> 22:32.582
Tucked up.

22:32.798 --> 22:34.781
Let's see, you ate in Cebisa.

22:34.861 --> 22:35.181
I did.

22:35.482 --> 22:40.468
Alright, describe, as a freshman, describe a chow hall day.

22:42.351 --> 22:55.428
Well, we ate there three times a day, and every time it was with a formation, even for lunch, we'd meet and march to chow, and you'd march in and you had a signed seat on most of the days.

22:55.509 --> 23:02.518
Weekends you'd have open seating, because the freshmen would always try to get together and get a table of only freshmen for the weekends.

23:02.836 --> 23:12.625
But you'd always have an upperclassman there, and you would basically sit at attention, and you would eat pretty much like a square meal.

23:13.606 --> 23:16.008
Although that's not as bad as it may sound to me.

23:16.048 --> 23:17.409
I never had a real problem with that.

23:18.029 --> 23:25.776
But we had, you know, the big deal was upperclassmen were served first, and you couldn't shortstop an upperclassman.

23:25.796 --> 23:26.397
That was a big deal.

23:26.417 --> 23:32.202
If you shortstopped an upperclassman, you'd get rammed, or you'd be asked to visit their hole.

23:32.485 --> 23:40.258
after chow for some explanation about why that isn't good, but you'd have to make sure your upperclassmen were serving.

23:40.278 --> 23:43.563
Of course, you called all the food head names.

23:44.204 --> 23:45.326
Yeah, share those.

23:45.406 --> 23:56.805
Gosh, Sandan was salt and pepper, and Spuds was potatoes, I believe, and Bullneck was meat.

23:57.427 --> 24:08.262
And when you wanted something, you'd say, shoot the bull neck, please, meaning pass the bull neck, please, and shoot the... What was bread?

24:08.883 --> 24:12.087
Bread was gun wadding?

24:12.107 --> 24:13.248
What was that?

24:13.329 --> 24:13.749
No, deal.

24:14.150 --> 24:14.690
Deal, yeah.

24:15.171 --> 24:17.154
And you'd say deal one when you wanted bread.

24:17.194 --> 24:17.675
That's right.

24:17.735 --> 24:17.975
Milk.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.438
Milk was cow.

24:20.458 --> 24:20.719
Butter.

24:22.701 --> 24:23.743
Grease, was it?

24:23.763 --> 24:24.424
I don't remember.

24:24.704 --> 24:25.425
Tea.

24:25.844 --> 24:32.815
I don't know if I remember T. Did coffee have a nickname?

24:33.096 --> 24:34.798
Everything had a nickname.

24:35.439 --> 24:38.144
Everything had a nickname.

24:39.346 --> 24:44.033
And some of them probably not as nice as others.

24:44.514 --> 24:48.240
Did you ever have any when you went home on a vacation?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.422
Did you ever forget?

24:49.874 --> 24:50.475
Yeah.

24:50.775 --> 24:51.576
And get in trouble?

24:52.297 --> 24:52.397
Yeah.

24:52.437 --> 24:56.903
Well, no, because I never used any of the bad, I can't remember ever using any of the bad terms.

24:58.125 --> 25:06.997
You know, one of them that was kind of gross was after birth, which was kind of tomatoes and squash or something.

25:07.057 --> 25:08.479
I forgot what would that dish be.

25:10.021 --> 25:10.401
Oh, God.

25:11.162 --> 25:12.164
I wish I could think of more.

25:12.204 --> 25:15.568
The artillery was beans.

25:15.588 --> 25:16.810
Shoot the artillery placement.

25:17.127 --> 25:29.857
But, I mean, you'd go home and you'd be sitting there, especially if you were with another, you know, if you were, maybe I'd go to Chris's home in Houston and, you know, you'd be sitting there next to him and say, shoot the, you know, shoot the.

25:29.877 --> 25:34.107
Did y'all, when you could, did y'all play any games at mealtimes?

25:34.778 --> 25:38.242
Boy, there weren't a lot of opportunities for that.

25:39.503 --> 25:56.181
We would, you know, there was a lot of eye contact things or the other thing you'd do is if you didn't have, like at noon, if you didn't have a one o'clock class, you'd kind of stall out the upperclassmen and then you could get a class, a table just a freshman.

25:56.962 --> 26:02.288
And the, and that used to be kind of nice.

26:02.555 --> 26:16.450
They had a day, like a fish day, it seemed like they called it, and this was April Fool's Day, if I recall correctly, and that's where the sophomore and freshman roles reversed, and the freshmen always looked forward to that.

26:16.490 --> 26:32.528
They thought that was great, but there's two things that they didn't realize, and the first one was that the next day they were back to being a fish again, and the second thing is that the sophomores knew that they were going to be back to being a fish again, so they didn't

26:32.828 --> 26:39.976
They didn't really have any, what do you call it, they didn't have any leverage over us.

26:40.356 --> 26:48.324
But I can remember, you know, you'd intentionally shortstop them on this fish day as a sophomore.

26:48.344 --> 26:52.949
I don't remember my fish day as much as a freshman, sophomore, I have very clear memories of that.

26:53.430 --> 27:02.059
But we would intentionally shortstop them and we would, we would, you know, they would speak to us

27:02.495 --> 27:04.938
We'd go on eating and they'd get after us.

27:04.958 --> 27:10.386
And I remember this one guy, this sounds terrible, I hate for you to put this in a book.

27:10.466 --> 27:18.357
This guy, the guy told me to, this freshman had told me to eat under the table.

27:18.377 --> 27:20.420
So I had to get down under the table and eat now.

27:20.881 --> 27:23.585
I don't ever remember that happening any time other than that one day.

27:23.605 --> 27:24.246
Literally sitting?

27:24.326 --> 27:28.131
Literally sit me down underneath the table.

27:28.415 --> 27:33.882
they're all sitting there, and I'm sitting underneath the table eating, and we had mashed potatoes that day.

27:35.064 --> 27:42.233
I just, I rub mashed potatoes in all their shoelaces.

27:45.718 --> 27:46.900
Then when that was discussed.

27:46.920 --> 27:56.953
I can still remember, well, you know, the funny thing is when I first started doing it, none of them knew I was doing it, and it's no fun, you know, because you're doing this and nobody realizes it's so

27:57.153 --> 28:10.214
Then I had to start rubbing on their shoes hard, and they realized what I was doing, so they started backing out, you know, making their chairs out, and it was slagged.

28:10.235 --> 28:16.605
I could still hear that noise on that in Sabisa whenever we'd slide those chairs out there because it was, you know, noisy.

28:17.066 --> 28:23.937
But they'd back up and look at their shoes, and so then they made me eat back up on top, you know, at the regular space on the table.

28:24.322 --> 28:25.564
There wasn't anything they could do.

28:25.604 --> 28:26.666
That was the whole thing.

28:27.348 --> 28:28.650
It was really a sophomore day.

28:28.670 --> 28:33.399
They just called it a fish day.

28:33.659 --> 28:34.842
Then we stacked their rooms.

28:34.882 --> 28:35.884
I remember doing that.

28:37.046 --> 28:38.669
Describe stacking the rooms.

28:38.689 --> 28:41.995
You basically would move everything to the center of the room.

28:44.059 --> 28:47.325
You'd usually start with a desk maybe.

28:47.693 --> 28:55.446
there were two desks to a room you'd just put those in the center of the room and then you would just start taking everything and stacking it on top of that and make a big pile.

28:55.967 --> 29:04.743
You'd take their mattresses off their bed with their their sheets and blankets and things and put that on there.

29:04.763 --> 29:07.547
You'd take their clothes out of their closet and stack it up there.

29:07.628 --> 29:12.296
We didn't really or at least I didn't wad anything up necessarily.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.077
I mean

29:13.360 --> 29:19.768
Not even necessarily, we tried to at least keep their uniforms from being messed up, but we just laid all that stuff in the center of the room.

29:20.109 --> 29:26.056
So when you walked in, open your door, there was everything in your room, just in one nice stack in the middle of the room.

29:27.038 --> 29:30.021
So you didn't have, that wasn't part of drowned out?

29:30.923 --> 29:35.689
No, I was trying to think about drowned outs.

29:35.749 --> 29:37.531
We've had some of those.

29:38.512 --> 29:41.396
And you didn't wad up paper and fill the room with paper?

29:41.476 --> 29:42.237
No.

29:42.470 --> 29:43.691
No, I didn't do any of that.

29:45.873 --> 29:49.998
I'll tell you, we babo-bombed, as sophomores, we babo-bombed our first sergeant.

29:50.618 --> 29:53.901
Describe your variety of babo-bombs.

29:54.122 --> 29:57.405
And this is kind of an interesting deal.

29:57.425 --> 30:10.418
He kind of, you know, at least the sophomores felt like he was favoring the freshmen over the sophomores and felt like we were getting a bad rap.

30:10.702 --> 30:14.187
We got in his room and unlocked his windows.

30:14.788 --> 30:22.339
And about 2 o'clock in the morning, 2.30 in the morning sometime, they set a babo bomb.

30:22.359 --> 30:35.118
And babo bomb, you'd take a babo, a can of babo, and you'd cut the top of it off and empty it out and put like an M80 firecracker in the bottom of it.

30:35.278 --> 30:37.602
And you'd fill it back up.

30:37.622 --> 30:40.506
And sometimes we'd fill that thing up with top and powder type stuff.

30:41.212 --> 30:53.830
And in this case, they laid that Babbo bomb on the, those rooms had heat, what do you call those things?

30:53.850 --> 30:55.513
Heat elements, you know what?

30:55.533 --> 30:56.134
Right here.

30:56.154 --> 30:56.514
Yeah.

30:57.195 --> 30:58.838
They had those over by the window.

30:58.938 --> 31:05.888
And so what they did is they came in in the night and slipped that window up and set that Babbo bomb in actually directional.

31:06.008 --> 31:09.413
A lot of times they'd sit on the floor in the middle of the room

31:09.646 --> 31:13.673
They go off and they kind of explode up like fireworks.

31:14.054 --> 31:19.202
Well, in this case, they set that babble bomb on its side, pointing at his room.

31:19.222 --> 31:20.705
So they never entered his room.

31:21.326 --> 31:22.488
And they lit the firecracker.

31:22.568 --> 31:25.133
And, of course, then you take off and get back to your room.

31:25.473 --> 31:26.575
I mean, I've seen them.
