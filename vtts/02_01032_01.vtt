00:01.921 --> 00:06.165
April 20, 1989 at Texas A&M concerning the Vietnam 
War. In the interest of accumulating knowledge

00:06.785 --> 00:13.891
about the war, I'm going to donate this tape to 
Texas A&M oral history collection in the

00:06.785 --> 00:13.891
university archives. Is that okay with you? Yes, 
that's fine. Okay. Why did you volunteer to go to

00:17.535 --> 00:23.620
Vietnam and what was the date of your first tour? I 
did not initially volunteer to go to Vietnam. I

00:27.023 --> 00:28.704
went at the convenience of the service. But I 
volunteered for the military Why I volunteered

00:32.566 --> 00:42.222
for the military was simply probably the Southern 
tradition of I saw the uniform and it really jazzed

00:32.566 --> 00:42.222
me up. Basically, I and three friends went down and 
volunteered. When I got into the service in 1967,

00:48.052 --> 00:55.485
the manpower needs were pretty strong. in Vietnam 
and the military just arbitrarily picked a number

00:56.208 --> 01:02.656
of us and sent us to Vietnam and that's how I got 
there the first tour.

01:05.740 --> 01:08.583
What was your understanding of the purpose of the 
war before you went? My understanding before I

01:09.384 --> 01:18.435
went of the purpose of the war is that we were trying 
to stop the communist advance in Southeast Asia.

01:19.765 --> 01:21.968
much the domino theory stuff. We were there to make 
the people of South Vietnam free and

01:22.729 --> 01:31.639
simultaneously keep the communists from taking 
over all of Asia.

01:34.763 --> 01:37.366
And what were your opinions of the president 
before the war? Opinions of LBJ?

01:44.475 --> 01:49.401
Really, to tell you the truth, I don't think I even 
had an opinion of LBJ other than the fact that he was

01:49.803 --> 01:53.974
The president, he was from Texas, and that was 
about it. I had no opinion one way or the other, to

01:55.499 --> 01:58.848
tell you the truth. Okay, how old were you? Let's 
see, in 1967. Eighteen. How did your opinions

02:07.420 --> 02:12.164
change as far as your understanding of the purpose 
of the war? I guess you didn't have any opinions

02:12.204 --> 02:19.691
specifically of the president, but how did they 
change during your experience there? Well, my

02:21.313 --> 02:28.399
opinions of the war changed during the time that I 
was there. How did it change, as I was saying? How

02:31.262 --> 02:32.042
did it change? Well, basically the way it changed 
was we had captured a North Vietnamese soldier who

02:37.458 --> 02:44.559
had been, prior to being in service, had been a 
professor of mathematics in Hanoi. And when we had

02:45.943 --> 02:48.531
captured him, he had agreed to become what was 
called a Kit Carson scout. They basically were

02:53.196 --> 02:56.301
people that came to work then for us. And we used 
them for translators and for intelligence

02:57.643 --> 03:03.151
gathering and all that. Kind of like the Indians 
with the cavalry back in the old west. And we were

03:08.919 --> 03:12.184
all sitting around one night getting drunk. And he 
told me that the only difference between me and him

03:14.971 --> 03:26.267
was that I wanted to go home to the U.S. and chase 
women, and he wanted to go back north and chase

03:14.971 --> 03:26.267
women, and that other than that, we had no 
difference. And it dawned on me after a period of

03:26.287 --> 03:37.342
time that he was right, that they were just like us, 
that they weren't communists, they were just

03:26.287 --> 03:37.342
people. And so my attitude became one then, if they 
were just people, what were we doing here? And then

03:43.557 --> 03:56.517
I began to question what Johnson and Westmoreland 
said at that time about Johnson's big speeches

03:43.557 --> 03:56.517
about the flag in Asia and all that. And I began to 
wonder, what is that man talking about? We really

04:00.223 --> 04:02.026
don't even belong here. Was that during your first 
tour? That was probably late in my first tour that I

04:04.951 --> 04:10.780
began to wonder, why am I here? And, okay, I guess 
just to give us an overview, can you tell, I guess,

04:13.409 --> 04:20.379
the dates and place of your three tours? Okay. The 
first time I went over was November the 17th, 1967,

04:21.181 --> 04:32.878
and came back September 5th or 6th, I believe, in 
68. Then went back again in late October of 68. And

04:40.628 --> 04:50.359
don't remember when I came back then, but went 
again in 70 and came back in early 71, like January

04:40.628 --> 04:50.359
71. Where was I? I was essentially out based at Da 
Nang. I was with the Navy Medical Corps. And if I

05:03.633 --> 05:07.497
recall right, it was the official name was Medical 
Headquarters Group out of Da Nang.

05:30.793 --> 05:31.354
And what else? Where was I? About three years in Da 
Nang. Yes. Do you know about the way the military

05:38.138 --> 05:42.585
works, especially between the Navy and the Marine 
Corps? Not really. I was going to ask you at

05:42.905 --> 05:44.428
service. All right. I was with the Navy. The Marine 
Corps is essentially a part of the Navy. It

05:51.519 --> 05:53.842
operates semi-autonomously. But in order not to 
duplicate some services, although they do

05:54.844 --> 06:05.901
duplicate other services, like you'll find Navy 
pilots and Marine Corps pilots, and you'll

05:54.844 --> 06:05.901
find... Marine Corps cooks and Navy cooks, but you 
will not find Navy medical personnel and Marine

06:06.455 --> 06:14.769
Corps medical personnel. The Marine Corps drafts 
those personnel from the Navy. So I was in the Navy,

06:19.156 --> 06:27.390
and I was what was called a hospital corpsman, 
which is what the Army calls a medic. And so I was in

06:30.029 --> 06:37.798
the Navy, attached to a Navy unit, but loaned out to 
a Marine Corps unit, so to speak. So I was, my

06:37.839 --> 06:48.592
attachment was with the 1st Marine Division, 5th 
Marines, which was based out of Da Nang, if I

06:37.839 --> 06:48.592
recall. I think that was their official 
headquarters. So you didn't really, did you go

06:51.495 --> 06:54.018
into any combat? Yes, you went, you were attached 
to a Marine Corps unit And you went where they went.

07:00.965 --> 07:02.547
And you went however they went. If they walked, you 
walked. If they flew, you flew. If they went in

07:05.190 --> 07:07.152
helicopters, you went in helicopters. You went in 
and you came out the same way they did. Hopefully

07:12.158 --> 07:13.359
that was a lie.

07:16.442 --> 07:19.406
But essentially you dressed like they did. The 
only difference was that you wore a Marine Corps

07:19.846 --> 07:27.154
uniform, but you wore a Navy insignia on it. Okay. 
You looked like them. You dressed like them. You

07:33.418 --> 07:34.960
moved and ate like them. You did everything they 
did except that you were technically a

07:34.980 --> 07:40.968
noncombatant. Did you have training for this? 
Yes. You go through Navy training and then you go

07:43.792 --> 07:50.822
through Marine Corps training and then you go 
where they go. Okay. So when I went in, I went

07:52.184 --> 07:54.728
through Navy boot camp. Then I went through Navy 
hospital school. Then I went through Marine Corps

07:59.296 --> 08:01.097
boot camp. And then if you were going to go with, 
say, a specialized unit like a recon team, which

08:01.698 --> 08:13.690
would be the equivalent of a Green Beret team, then 
you went through that special recon training as

08:01.698 --> 08:13.690
well. And then you went wherever they went.

08:19.495 --> 08:25.221
So that's how I got attached to the Marine Corps. 
you were, because you were technically a

08:25.538 --> 08:34.388
non-combatant, you were issued a weapon for your 
personal defense. And you theoretically were not

08:35.209 --> 08:40.995
supposed to use this weapon in an offensive or 
combative role. You were only supposed to use it

08:41.015 --> 08:45.280
just to protect yourself from being killed. That 
sidearm, it was a sidearm, it was a .45 pistol. Most

08:51.006 --> 08:54.870
corpsmen that I knew The weapon was in such sad 
state of repair that we grabbed whatever weapon we

08:55.222 --> 09:00.691
could find after that. You know, I personally had a 
.357 revolver, a Smith & Wesson revolver that I

09:01.673 --> 09:09.666
carried in a shoulder holster. But we looked just 
like Marines. The only thing was we carried a

09:11.809 --> 09:14.914
medical kit. Now, you've seen the World War II 
pictures where they had the little red cross and

09:14.934 --> 09:19.983
all that, the little arm brassers. Okay, you were 
issued those. but you learned very quickly not to

09:22.222 --> 09:26.691
wear those because they made outstanding 
targets. So you immediately put the brassard in

09:28.114 --> 09:39.015
your pocket or in your medical kit or just flat 
threw it away and you got something to cover that

09:28.114 --> 09:39.015
red cross up on your helmet. that World War II was 
much different, or at least what you see in the

09:39.502 --> 09:46.231
movies was much different than the way it really 
went down in Vietnam. Nobody wore the Red Cross

09:46.251 --> 09:49.596
unless they wanted to die. Okay. Next, while we're 
on the subject of the military, what were your

09:51.459 --> 10:00.491
opinions of military leadership?

10:00.511 --> 10:01.833
Opinions of military leadership. Depends on what 
level. The very highest level I thought was very

10:03.355 --> 10:06.880
ignorant. They did not know what was going on. They 
would come into the country for what was called a

10:09.539 --> 10:14.755
commanding general's inspection. He'd be there 
three hours. They'd run him around the base, show

10:15.939 --> 10:22.620
him a few things, show him some super-duper 
weapons, and he'd go home thinking that we were

10:15.939 --> 10:22.620
beating the world. You know, the day-to-day 
leadership had more experience because they were

10:23.242 --> 10:28.192
there. And they saw the problems, and they saw that 
the textbook would not always work, or they saw

10:29.354 --> 10:36.368
where the textbook would work. But generally you 
saw no higher... Oh, I don't guess I really ever saw

10:41.230 --> 10:48.003
much higher than maybe a Marine Corps colonel who 
was actually on a day-to-day basis. I'm talking

10:48.384 --> 10:52.111
about actually in the field situation. In the 
offices back in the headquarters areas, I'm sure

10:52.131 --> 10:59.425
they had generals and like that. It was the field 
leadership was very wise. They knew what was going

11:03.412 --> 11:04.394
on. They were out there fighting it with us. The 
upper leadership, especially in the case of like

11:06.477 --> 11:15.610
General Westmoreland and some of those, I don't 
think they ever knew what the picture really was.

11:16.451 --> 11:20.417
They had what they thought the picture was, and it 
was generally fundamentally wrong. Did you learn

11:20.718 --> 11:22.080
this pretty quickly? Yeah, about the first week or 
two. You learn very quickly or you die, you know. I

11:29.630 --> 11:40.604
had my first rude shock about the military the 
first time that I ever got out of a helicopter. When

11:40.644 --> 11:49.596
we had practice back in the States, the helicopter 
would come in and it would be like about two feet off

11:40.644 --> 11:49.596
the ground and it would stop and everybody would 
jump out, right? Okay. In Vietnam, with people

11:50.992 --> 12:01.529
shooting at you, the helicopter maybe got 
somewhere between 10 or 12 feet from the ground,

11:50.992 --> 12:01.529
sometimes closer, and it didn't exactly stop. It 
just came to a slow move, and you got out the best way

12:01.549 --> 12:05.756
you knew how. Sometimes they would stop, just 
depending on what the situation we were in. Also,

12:11.466 --> 12:15.312
when I realized that... the first time people were 
actually shooting at you, you know, and that they

12:15.511 --> 12:23.619
really weren't afraid of because you weren't 
American, you know. That didn't bother them the

12:23.639 --> 12:26.161
least bit. It wasn't like I'm an American, you 
know, the whole world stops for me. And you realize

12:30.385 --> 12:35.931
that some of your leadership, you know, you're in 
the middle of a serious firefight. I mean, you're

12:35.951 --> 12:37.172
pinned down. And this guy says, follow me over the 
top like John Wayne, and you think, this guy's out

12:44.063 --> 12:45.169
of this hole, you know? And so you learned real 
quick or you died.

13:05.275 --> 13:11.603
How did you adapt to your first time there and was 
this adaptation easier than your second and

13:05.275 --> 13:11.603
third? I mean, was your second and third easier 
than the first? Okay, how did I adapt the first time

13:15.087 --> 13:18.391
I was there? The way I adapted the first time that I 
was there was probably I just flushed out of my mind

13:18.411 --> 13:30.726
everything that everybody had taught me and went 
back to some real basic survival type instincts.

13:31.077 --> 13:35.982
Also had help of a sergeant whose name was Coyne. He 
was from, it was kind of really unusual spelling,

13:37.744 --> 13:45.252
it was K-O-I-N-N-E, you know. And he was from New 
Orleans, and he had been in country for, I don't

13:45.272 --> 13:51.960
know, I think at least one tour, probably more. In 
fact, I'm pretty sure it was more. And he decided

13:55.484 --> 13:59.548
that for some reason or the other, that I was too 
stupid to survive on my own, and that he was going to

13:59.967 --> 14:06.055
kind of take me under his wing. And it's kind of like 
you see all these movies of a father taking a young

14:06.075 --> 14:14.507
son out, teaching him about the woods. Well, this 
was kind of what this guy was doing. He was taking me

14:16.389 --> 14:21.737
out and teaching me that, okay, look, I know they 
taught you this in boot camp. Let me show you how it

14:22.278 --> 14:23.379
really is. And, you know, I... I credit that 
probably with keeping me alive. He told me that

14:30.070 --> 14:36.857
there were times to stand up and run, and there were 
times to keep your head down and run, and times not

14:30.070 --> 14:36.857
to run at all. And that paid off in my second and 
third tours in that I managed to get back in at least

14:38.039 --> 14:45.527
one piece and alive. And I would say probably had it 
not been for him, had it not been from training from

14:46.588 --> 14:55.438
someone who had been there and knew the ropes, that 
I probably would have gotten killed more. Almost

14:58.186 --> 15:01.651
did as it was. He had some close calls. Yeah, we had a 
few. How did you relate to the South Vietnamese

15:07.400 --> 15:13.710
people, and did you have any previous cultural 
training? Previous cultural training? None

15:15.834 --> 15:17.076
whatsoever. How did I relate to the South 
Vietnamese people? At first, the South

15:22.504 --> 15:25.729
Vietnamese people were... It's probably like 
going into any foreign country. The South

15:29.176 --> 15:32.100
Vietnamese people have their own strange way of 
doing things.

15:34.925 --> 15:44.680
First of all, they're shorter than we are for the 
most part, so you are a giant wherever you go, which

15:34.925 --> 15:44.680
makes you feel pretty good until somebody bigger 
than you comes along. They have some unusual ways

15:45.341 --> 15:53.353
of doing things, and at first you get the 
impression that these people are... that they're

15:53.553 --> 15:57.077
stupid, they're backwards. To some extent, you 
think that they're a little weird in that... Have

15:57.217 --> 16:04.206
you ever read this book, Backfire? Uh-huh, yeah, I 
read it. Okay. He talks about one of the really

16:06.068 --> 16:19.003
things in there that's interesting about South 
Vietnamese that apparently a good deal of the

16:06.068 --> 16:19.003
military never learned was that South Vietnamese 
men can walk down the street holding hands. Okay.

16:20.625 --> 16:20.725
Okay. Well, here, we don't think that's quite so 
cool. So, you know, you're sitting there and

16:24.460 --> 16:26.803
you're watching this. You've been in country 
maybe three or four days, and you're watching

16:27.043 --> 16:31.728
these guys walking down the street holding hands. 
And you're thinking, these two guys are funny.

16:36.052 --> 16:40.276
Then everybody starts doing it in South Vietnam, 
and you think the whole country's funny. After a

16:41.998 --> 16:45.902
while, though... at least in my mind, was that you 
begin to want to see some of the country and see the

16:46.726 --> 16:52.794
customs. Because, you know, we didn't fight all 
the time we were there. I mean, there were times

16:55.779 --> 17:00.385
that you would be absolutely bored to tears for two 
or three weeks at a time. And then you may be

17:01.807 --> 17:04.571
fighting solid two or three weeks at a time. But for 
the most part, we didn't fight every day. That's

17:07.175 --> 17:13.624
kind of one of the things that people think that we 
did, that we fought 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

17:13.664 --> 17:14.264
We really didn't. You know, you might be... two or 
three weeks, just bored out of your mind, and then

17:16.578 --> 17:20.664
have a two or three hour fight. And then you got 
liberty, you know, like R&R or, you know, a pass,

17:23.168 --> 17:30.260
okay? And so I went to Saigon. And I fell in love with 
my first love in Saigon. I fell in love with part

17:36.630 --> 17:41.577
Chinese, part Vietnamese, part French girl. And 
Because you fall in love, you start learning a

17:42.734 --> 17:51.589
whole lot about people and culture, you know, and 
just the things that you do when you fall in love. I

17:51.709 --> 17:58.660
mean, you know, we would go to markets and stuff, 
and, you know, I mean, when you're in love, you do

17:51.709 --> 17:58.660
whatever that other person wants to do, you know. 
And she wanted to go to the market. Okay, what are

18:00.143 --> 18:01.265
you going to do? You know, you want to be with her? 
You go to the market. And you just can't help but

18:03.749 --> 18:06.373
learning things, you know. And that's where I 
began first learning about self and these people.

18:10.274 --> 18:11.616
You can also get drunk with them. They'll tell you a 
whole lot of good things about them. We read

18:15.762 --> 18:18.125
Backfire for our class. Do you agree with most of 
the things that he's saying in the book, or do you

18:18.625 --> 18:25.134
have any disagreements with him? Insofar as he 
talks about the American attitude toward the war

18:26.596 --> 18:38.813
and the notion of American exceptionalism and how 
that arose, I 100% agree with him on that. Now, some

18:39.147 --> 18:47.637
of the other things about how decisions were made, 
I'm going to have to assume that he has had benefit

18:39.147 --> 18:47.637
of documents that I haven't had. And so I'd have to 
assume that he's right, and I really don't have an

18:47.717 --> 18:51.742
opinion one way or the other. What about on our, I 
guess, total lack of understanding of the

18:52.083 --> 18:56.568
entities? That, for the most part, is true. Did you 
see that with other... Yes, I saw that. I would say

19:01.014 --> 19:04.598
that there were...

19:05.978 --> 19:20.023
Of the soldiers that were in my unit, about 100 
soldiers, there were maybe four that really had

19:05.978 --> 19:20.023
any kind of understanding of how Vietnam worked at 
all and how the people lived. The rest of them just

19:20.424 --> 19:23.029
seemed to hate them. They hated them because we 
were there. They hated them because they resisted

19:25.653 --> 19:28.358
what we did. They hated them because it was 
Tuesday. They just hated them. They hated them.

19:34.141 --> 19:35.103
They hated the enemy. They just hated everything. 
There were maybe four or five people in a unit that

19:38.669 --> 19:50.008
would either, for whatever reason, would try to 
understand the Vietnamese and understand Just

19:50.596 --> 19:52.799
understand the culture and the way of life. Maybe 
not a particular person, but just understand how

19:52.839 --> 20:00.530
can these people be like this and would spend the 
effort. Can you understand the frustrations that

20:01.311 --> 20:06.378
built up to have something like a My Life or a thing? 
I can understand the frustrations that built up. I

20:10.944 --> 20:14.889
can't understand the wholesale killing. Yes, I 
can very readily understand the frustrations.

20:19.283 --> 20:30.818
You see, back in the States, prior to the Tet 
Offensive of 68,

20:19.283 --> 20:30.818
y'all were told, the people in the States were told 
that we were winning the war. Well, we were told the

20:31.079 --> 20:33.061
same thing. We're in Vietnam fighting the war. 
When the Tet Offensive came down, of course, we're

20:35.585 --> 20:40.391
there, so we're the first ones to know. And you 
don't know what's going on all over the country,

20:41.433 --> 20:46.860
but you knew what was happening right where you 
were at. And we were getting the hell beat out of us

20:47.482 --> 20:49.985
right where I was at. And so we begin, you know, 
first of all, we're trying to stay alive. You're

20:54.589 --> 20:56.812
trying to figure out at the same time how this 
happened. Try to figure out what's going on, you

20:56.992 --> 20:59.495
know. And then you don't believe your leaders, 
okay? You don't believe your leaders. You don't

21:05.201 --> 21:09.845
believe the South Vietnamese because from our 
experience, they lied to us all the time. You don't

21:11.287 --> 21:14.630
understand why these people don't want to be 
democratized. You don't understand why you're

21:15.311 --> 21:17.033
there. You're just frustrated with your 
military, with the people in the country, and with

21:17.435 --> 21:22.382
yourself. And you're just totally mad at 
everybody. So I can understand the frustration. I

21:27.610 --> 21:38.345
can't understand it to the point that I'm going to 
take a weapon and just go out and just massacre some

21:27.610 --> 21:38.345
woman or some children or some old man, you know, as 
a way to work off my frustrations. I just don't

21:38.445 --> 21:41.430
believe that I could have ever done that. Did you 
have any experience with V.C.? ? Yeah. The one guy

21:48.057 --> 21:51.982
that we captured, the one I was telling you about, 
he was a VC. Well, actually, he was an NVA, North

21:52.223 --> 21:54.726
Vietnamese Army. He was a regular, a professional 
soldier. VC, we captured, for the most part, the

21:58.110 --> 22:10.847
understanding at the VC that I had were that they 
were, first of all, everybody in Vietnam is

21:58.110 --> 22:10.847
basically illiterate. Not everybody, but for the 
most part the population is illiterate. They live

22:15.621 --> 22:17.324
off of tradition. And it is very easy to whip some 
people into, if you go in to lay some propaganda on

22:18.285 --> 22:28.701
them and whip them up. Since they had been fighting 
from what they thought was imperialism for many,

22:29.137 --> 22:43.298
many years, it was not hard for the NVA to whip them 
up into thinking that we were just the same

22:29.137 --> 22:43.298
imperialistic dogs that the French were. Some 
others weren't fighting from this high notion of

22:44.003 --> 22:49.768
nationalism. Some of them were actually 
impressed. I mean, the VC or the NBA or VC went out

22:52.150 --> 22:57.635
and said, you're now in the military. You either 
fight or you die, or we kill your parents, or your

22:58.035 --> 23:03.800
mother, father, sister, wife, or whatever. And so 
they were kind of forced conscripts. For the most

23:09.005 --> 23:13.048
part, they were generally fairly poorly trained. 
fairly bad soldiers, and generally the life of a VC

23:13.383 --> 23:26.506
was probably not too long because he was not a 
professional soldier. Not that the life of a

23:27.808 --> 23:38.327
professional soldier was all that much longer, 
but I'd say that being made a VC was almost nearly

23:27.808 --> 23:38.327
suicide.

23:41.412 --> 23:47.839
Did your opinions of the South Vietnamese change 
during the war? No, well, yes, I guess it did. When I

23:50.261 --> 24:05.918
first went over, I didn't know what South 
Vietnamese was, except that they were about 5'2",

23:50.261 --> 24:05.918
and that they had slanted eyes, and they were these 
little people who talked real funny, and they were

23:50.261 --> 24:05.918
being victimized by this mean old communist up 
north, and that they were kind of backwards and all

23:50.261 --> 24:05.918
that. And so that was what was basically told to us 
and the impression that I got as I went over. After I

24:14.510 --> 24:16.773
got there, my impression changed. That 
impression stayed with me and has not changed to

24:18.254 --> 24:22.358
this date. I think the South Vietnamese people are 
people just like anybody else. I think that they

24:29.045 --> 24:31.087
have their own way of doing things. They have their 
own culture, their own traditions, their own

24:31.348 --> 24:35.652
notions of what Vietnam is. And in that regard, I 
don't have a change of opinion. I don't

24:42.505 --> 24:46.129
particularly think their way is any better or 
worse than ours. I just think it's different. The

24:48.852 --> 25:03.148
only part of the population that I have a worry 
about is probably the Amerasians, the children of

24:48.852 --> 25:03.148
Vietnamese and Americans, that a good deal of them 
apparently are still in Vietnam. And I understand

25:03.168 --> 25:04.710
that they... that they're kind of like lepers or 
treated like lepers, that they make their living

25:05.315 --> 25:16.912
by being prostitutes or black marketeers or that 
the Vietnamese don't like them. And our soldiers

25:18.174 --> 25:22.060
just basically abandoned them. And I've got some 
wonders about, on the part of our government,

25:22.080 --> 25:29.130
whether or not it's fair to leave those people 
there. But then again, what are you going to do

25:30.773 --> 25:32.595
about getting them out? That's the other 
question. But no, my opinions towards the South

25:34.964 --> 25:38.869
Vietnamese hadn't changed. Okay, as far as I've 
read a lot about problems with drugs and then with

25:40.310 --> 25:46.978
careerism, do you have any comments about that? 
Problems with drugs? You mean like were there

25:48.400 --> 25:50.422
drugs there? Well, did you see it? Oh, you bet. Big 
time. Drug use in Vietnam was big time. There were

25:59.028 --> 26:12.646
instances that I saw and that I knew of where, in 
fact, the South Vietnamese military was the

25:59.028 --> 26:12.646
biggest drug pushers in certain areas of anybody. 
Also, you've got to consider something about

26:13.047 --> 26:21.058
American soldiers and American people. American 
people are used to leisure, having things to do.

26:23.601 --> 26:27.246
Football, baseball, tennis, going to... the 
Dixie chicken or whatever. And a lot of times in

26:30.155 --> 26:34.641
Vietnam it was miserably boring. You would spend a 
couple of three weeks just doing day-to-day

26:34.661 --> 26:41.070
mundane chores. How would you like to spend your 
entire eight-hour day putting sand into canvas

26:42.292 --> 26:55.050
bags and stacking these bags up for your fire camp 
and then doing that for two or three solid weeks? So

26:55.491 --> 26:57.013
you get kind of bored, right? And then at night, you 
get to lay inside of this nifty fire camp that you

26:57.179 --> 27:04.766
built and listen to a radio. And that's about your 
whole life in Vietnam there for that period while

27:04.846 --> 27:10.752
you're in this base camp. So people have to have 
something to do. You're frustrated. Your life is

27:16.117 --> 27:18.980
boring. You don't know whether you're going to die 
a minute from now, a week from now, whatever. So

27:23.744 --> 27:26.747
drugs became kind of a way of people drinking to 
forget their problems. Drug usage in certain

27:29.620 --> 27:33.045
places was real big. Certain other places is 
almost unheard of. Would I say 50% of American

27:36.549 --> 27:42.016
servicemen use drugs or 30% or 10%? I'd say 
probably in the younger group, probably 80% or

27:42.737 --> 27:49.787
more. Younger group being 22 or younger, you know. 
But that was also the age of people that were

27:57.541 --> 28:06.793
drafted, and a good deal of those had come into the 
service with drug histories at home. So, you know,

28:07.914 --> 28:12.980
I mean, they may have brought some of that with 
them. I don't know. But, yeah, there was a good deal

28:13.982 --> 28:15.904
of drug usage. Okay. Careerism, I don't know that I 
know what you mean by careerism. People wanting to

28:20.750 --> 28:27.058
go to Vietnam to put it on their resume that they 
were an officer. If they were an officer, going to

28:27.528 --> 28:33.175
Vietnam would sometimes get them over the hump. 
Everybody knew the war would be over one of these

28:35.558 --> 28:44.990
days, and that in peacetime military, it's almost 
impossible to be promoted beyond a certain level.

28:45.470 --> 28:55.543
So a good deal of these officers would, at least in 
my line of thinking, would go to Vietnam, serve

28:45.470 --> 28:55.543
some rather rinky-dink tour, You know, but be able 
to say that, you know, I was in Vietnam and then

28:56.215 --> 29:01.340
could progress and rank. You know, I would say that 
the under officers or the lower level officers

29:02.401 --> 29:22.022
like lieutenants and captains and, you know, like 
that probably, I would say they're probably some

29:02.401 --> 29:22.022
of them that were like ladder climbers, but I'd say 
for the most part they were doing like the rest of

29:02.401 --> 29:22.022
us. They just wanted to live through it all and get 
home. Why did you volunteer for subsequent tours?

29:28.927 --> 29:31.270
Because I was dumb. Okay. But how are these tours 
different from the first as far as seeing a change

29:31.830 --> 29:39.560
in the type of combat and then attitudes of 
soldiers? Okay. Why did I volunteer for

29:42.464 --> 29:44.206
subsequent tours? Okay. I volunteered for kind of 
a combination of reasons. One of them was after I'd

29:51.054 --> 29:53.998
done my first tour, I went back to the States, and I 
went back to, well, I went home on leave. You know,

30:00.823 --> 30:02.906
you get 30 days leave, and I went home. And my little 
brother is like a year younger than I am. And my

30:11.337 --> 30:13.920
little brother's got this real John Wayne 
mentality. Well, they have this thing in the

30:14.821 --> 30:20.708
military that they won't send two sons to a war 
zone. They'll let them both be in the service, but

30:20.728 --> 30:23.732
they won't send them both to the war zone. So I 
pretty much figured my little brother was one of

30:24.235 --> 30:33.109
those fools that would run him over the top and do 
like John Wayne and get himself blown away

30:24.235 --> 30:33.109
completely. So if I went back to Vietnam, he 
couldn't go because he would be the sole surviving

30:33.910 --> 30:39.519
son. That was one reason. Another reason was that 
when I went to the Naval Hospital in San Diego,

30:42.043 --> 30:51.357
what was going to be my assigned duty for the next 
three years was going to be real mundane tasks. And

30:58.281 --> 31:04.951
I decided that I wasn't going to spend the rest of my 
career in the military being bored out of my mind.

31:06.914 --> 31:20.314
The third reason was that there was a program that 
people that would volunteer, they would give you a

31:06.914 --> 31:20.314
cut off your enlistment, off your active tour of 
duty.

31:20.564 --> 31:29.772
Originally, when I volunteered for six years 
active, I thought, boy, I do not want to be here

31:20.564 --> 31:29.772
doing this for the next five years. So if you 
volunteer for a tour, they would cut your

31:29.792 --> 31:36.157
enlistment like six months or nine months or a 
year, whatever. And so for a combination of all

31:36.998 --> 31:43.764
those reasons is why I went for the subsequent 
tours. What were the differences?

31:48.088 --> 31:49.609
Oh, probably...

31:51.665 --> 31:52.306
differences? Well, in 67 we thought we were 
winning. After 68 we knew we weren't.

32:00.134 --> 32:06.861
We had heard discussions about the truce talks and 
the peace talks and everything. And we figured

32:07.481 --> 32:13.948
that sooner or later that somebody was going to 
come up with some kind of peaceful deals and we

32:07.481 --> 32:13.948
could get out of Vietnam. And so basically we just 
sort of fought defensively then. All we wanted to

32:18.953 --> 32:20.895
do was Keep up from killing us. We weren't really so 
worried about whether we were going to win or

32:23.301 --> 32:26.926
whether we were going to lose. We just didn't want 
to die. And just keep our head down, do your tour,

32:29.409 --> 32:33.175
and go home. It's like going to see a bad movie. You 
just want to get the thing over with so that you can

32:37.781 --> 32:41.125
leave. So that was about it. the attitude. Now, I 
mean, that's not to say that we didn't try to fight

32:43.544 --> 32:46.268
battles. A lot of times you would have to fight a 
battle, and you would have to try to win just to stay

32:46.749 --> 32:55.822
alive, but I think the attitude was not so much one 
of winning as much as it was just trying to stay

32:46.749 --> 32:55.822
alive. Okay, what about as far as the attitudes of 
the people that were there? You mean American

33:03.132 --> 33:04.815
soldiers that were there? Yeah, yeah. Pretty much 
everybody had the same attitude, you know. We had

33:08.800 --> 33:10.643
what we called... base camp commandos who were 
these guys that would do the John Wayne bit. And

33:16.527 --> 33:21.216
pretty much everybody made fun of them and tried to 
stay away from them because that was the kind of guy

33:16.527 --> 33:21.216
that'd get you killed. The rest of us took care of 
each other. You take care of me, I take care of you.

33:27.006 --> 33:32.597
We just try to keep each other alive until you can go 
home.

33:34.501 --> 33:41.130
Nobody really wanted to fight because everybody 
really thought it was kind of futile. We weren't

33:41.170 --> 33:42.152
winning. We weren't going to win. All we wanted to 
do was do our 11 months and go home and try to get home

33:43.554 --> 33:51.345
in one piece. You really thought that you weren't 
going to win? No. After the 68 test, I don't think

33:53.748 --> 33:58.855
that anybody really thought we would win. except 
for maybe the military leaders. I would say that

34:03.630 --> 34:20.993
the average soldier, I'm talking about average 
actual real combat soldier, a guy that was

34:03.630 --> 34:20.993
actually out there shooting, I would think that he 
probably figured that the best we could do was

34:03.630 --> 34:20.993
fight to a draw. You know, that given the political 
situation at home and...

34:27.657 --> 34:32.784
you know, given the curtailment on the military 
that the best we could hope for was a drop. Now, we

34:32.804 --> 34:41.377
all thought that we could win, you know, that we had 
the stuff, you know, to win if we were allowed to

34:32.804 --> 34:41.377
win. But we felt like we weren't allowed to win. How 
do you mean? Well, we felt like the military and the

34:46.785 --> 34:55.858
government back home was actually hampering us 
with this notion of limited war. Because they

34:56.699 --> 34:59.563
talked about limited bombing of the North. Our 
feeling was that you either go out and you fight a

35:00.625 --> 35:07.575
real war or you don't fight a war. That there's no 
such thing as a limited fight. Kind of goes back to

35:12.343 --> 35:18.572
the notion of like, did you ever get in fights when 
you were a little kid? When I was a little kid, the

35:18.788 --> 35:22.692
way you fought was you always fought the guy. And if 
you knocked him on the ground, you didn't jump on

35:22.813 --> 35:25.496
top of him. You let him get back up. Or you never hit 
below the belt. That's limited war. What really

35:33.645 --> 35:34.566
happens? Generally, if you knock the guy down, you 
pile in on top of him because now you've got the

35:35.066 --> 35:41.213
advantage and you're going to beat his brains out. 
And if he's piled all over you, you forget about

35:42.295 --> 35:45.378
hitting below the belt. You hit him wherever you 
can hit him. Well, that's what we felt like, that

35:47.307 --> 36:03.955
these rules were placed on us, that they were like 
those rules, that either we were really going to

35:47.307 --> 36:03.955
fight or we were just going to go home, that given 
the situation, the best we could hope for was just a

35:47.307 --> 36:03.955
draw. So since we weren't going to win, And 
presumably we weren't going to lose. We were just

36:10.335 --> 36:11.656
going to drop. There was no real reason to go out and 
really do anything because you're liable to get

36:11.676 --> 36:17.922
yourself killed. And the whole idea was to stay 
alive and go home. What would you have preferred

36:20.625 --> 36:24.829
that we had done as far as military strategy? Not 
gotten there in the first

36:24.849 --> 36:30.274
place. In 65 or 66, I believe it was, the... I 
believe it was the Marine Corps had a strategy that

36:36.380 --> 36:42.746
I think the Army popularized it really. It was 
called search and destroy. And we would basically

36:46.349 --> 36:57.360
sweep in on a known or what was supposed to be known 
VC area. And they would come in like a big pair of

36:58.161 --> 37:03.906
pliers and they would just close those pliers 
down. And they would destroy the military village

37:04.392 --> 37:09.881
at a fight of the VC. And if that meant burning the 
food, burning the village, or actually we didn't

37:09.901 --> 37:20.258
just burn the village, we burned anything that 
would be of any military value to the VC. One of the

37:20.879 --> 37:24.947
cute things that I thought was that we also burned 
the food, or we poisoned it. While it was also of

37:26.210 --> 37:31.761
military value to the VC, it was the people in the 
villages whose food we were tearing up. I always

37:32.042 --> 37:40.238
thought, well, that's kind of unusual to me, that 
we're going to whip the VC by whipping the civilian

37:32.042 --> 37:40.238
populace. I mean, if it was like an area that was a 
known B.C. holdup, we would have this plier

37:43.834 --> 37:56.251
movement, and we would just pinch them in, close 
them in, and then just squeeze it down until we

37:43.834 --> 37:56.251
choked the military fighting ability out of them. 
That meant killing all of them, and that was what

37:57.393 --> 38:00.517
you had to do. And it depended on who you got around. 
If it was the B.C., you might get him to surrender.

38:08.517 --> 38:13.502
If it was a North Vietnamese regular, you were 
pretty much going to have to kill him. He was a good

38:13.522 --> 38:15.644
soldier. He was a professional soldier, and he was 
not going to give up. It's kind of like the picture

38:20.629 --> 38:26.956
of the Japanese kamikaze guys during World War II. 
The North Vietnamese soldier was so well trained

38:27.076 --> 38:33.943
and so well disciplined that you were probably 
going to have to kill him. You were not going to get

38:33.963 --> 38:36.786
him to give up. Did you feel as though the American 
government and top military people did not

38:37.660 --> 38:50.915
realize that the North Vietnamese were not going 
to give up with the policy of attrition and those

38:37.660 --> 38:50.915
kinds of ideas? Did I think that that's what they 
thought? Yeah, that's very definitely what I

38:53.898 --> 38:56.942
think they thought. I do not think that our 
government, with the exception of maybe a few

38:56.962 --> 39:03.549
people, but I think they were in the minority. I 
think that they felt that Westmoreland's war of

39:07.951 --> 39:11.335
attrition would eventually work. And I think 
that, I believe it was General Jopp, or maybe it was

39:11.355 --> 39:18.405
Ho, who many years before had said that he would 
fight. How long did we want to fight? 10 years? 20

39:20.567 --> 39:21.288
years? 50 years? They would fight however long we 
wanted to fight, and in the end, they would win. And

39:27.957 --> 39:31.762
I think we should have read Ho's book a lot closer 
than we did. They were going to win. Either that or

39:38.292 --> 39:49.322
we were going to have to physically go into North 
Vietnam and just take the war to them and destroy

39:38.292 --> 39:49.322
them. Do you think that we should have gone into 
North Vietnam? Well, it depends.

39:55.888 --> 40:02.654
It depends on whether you want to look at it from the 
military point of view or whether you want to look

39:55.888 --> 40:02.654
at it on the moralistic point of view. If you want to 
look at it on the military point of view in that To

40:08.768 --> 40:11.211
win this war, we've got to go into Vietnam. We're 
not going to consider the moral aspect of whether

40:11.231 --> 40:14.496
we've been there or not. Yes, we should have gone 
into North Vietnam. Even with the prospect of

40:17.039 --> 40:18.962
China? I don't really think that the prospect of 
China was quite as much as everybody made it out to

40:19.622 --> 40:26.131
be, especially it seems to me. Now, there were a 
good deal of Chinese weaponry, but I think that was

40:26.211 --> 40:33.561
really kind of overblown. And some stuff that I've 
heard subsequent from some people that were

40:33.794 --> 40:51.212
relatively believable military people have said 
that the notion of China coming into the war was

40:33.794 --> 40:51.212
much larger than China's real ability to get into 
the war. I don't think that they would have

40:52.340 --> 41:02.816
actually committed the ravaging forces like they 
did or are supposed to have done in Korea.

41:03.738 --> 41:08.765
From the military point of view, yes, I think we 
should have gone into the north. From the

41:08.946 --> 41:12.792
moralistic point of view, I don't think we should 
have ever got there in the beginning. I think we

41:13.653 --> 41:16.818
should have listened to the French and should have 
read Ho's book. I think we should have just

41:17.960 --> 41:20.203
basically stayed home.

41:23.575 --> 41:31.143
Well, I guess it has to do with my question as far as, 
did you feel when you first went over there that we

41:23.575 --> 41:31.143
were justified in being there? And when did you 
change your mind? When I went there, yes, I felt we

41:33.265 --> 41:35.568
were justified. Because I didn't know any better. 
I mean, I listened to Lyndon Johnson and all the

41:38.351 --> 41:41.915
people back home. The draft Dodger bit and all 
this. There's this cultural engravement in

41:47.661 --> 41:51.405
people. Do you want your parents to think that 
you're a draft dodger? Do you want to have to leave

41:57.816 --> 42:01.782
your country and go to Canada? Or do you want to go to 
prison? Those are some questions you have to ask.

42:07.911 --> 42:13.360
But on the other hand, when we went and when I went 
and the people that I went with, We got there, and

42:13.812 --> 42:27.571
for the first little while, some people it took 
longer, some people it took a very short time, some

42:13.812 --> 42:27.571
people never learned it, and some people was that 
we really thought we were doing the right thing. I

42:27.591 --> 42:31.616
mean, people have asked me, why did you ever go to 
Vietnam? I went to Vietnam because I thought I was

42:31.636 --> 42:34.560
doing the right thing. When I was in Vietnam, my job 
was a medic. All I wanted to do was I wanted to make

42:40.475 --> 42:50.670
sure that this soldier, that I kept him alive so 
that he could go home. I wanted to be the very best

42:50.890 --> 42:55.416
medic that the United States military ever had. I 
wanted to do my job because I thought it was right.

43:01.665 --> 43:09.857
It took a little while for me to figure out that it 
wasn't quite right, but at first we went because we

43:01.665 --> 43:09.857
really thought that was the right thing. And we 
were proud. And I mean, we were really proud. We

43:14.552 --> 43:19.117
thought that we were fighting communists, making 
these people free. And that's what we really

43:21.220 --> 43:23.522
believed. I had some friends who were in ships off 
the coast that were just bombarding the hell out of

43:23.542 --> 43:28.849
Vietnam. We would talk to them, and they really 
thought they were doing the right thing. We all

43:33.914 --> 43:37.258
really thought we were doing the right thing. I 
think that probably changed After the Tet, we

43:40.094 --> 43:46.263
began to wonder, what the hell are we doing? And 
then later, as the war drug on, I think the attitude

43:47.224 --> 43:54.835
was really just, I'm caught up in the system. I just 
want to do my time and go. Even the people that were

43:57.619 --> 44:02.206
coming there for the first time, just initially? 
That's kind of a real iffy one. Some of them really

44:03.968 --> 44:06.692
thought they were doing the right thing. Some of 
them thought, oh my God, this is my worst

44:07.145 --> 44:10.328
nightmare. Some of them really thought they were 
doing the wrong thing, that they had been caught up

44:11.309 --> 44:16.814
in the system and that they couldn't fight the 
system.

44:19.797 --> 44:21.699
I'd say probably the first attitude. You could 
always tell when a new guy came into your camp or

44:22.159 --> 44:25.122
something. He was the guy that was going to make the 
world a safer democracy, kill communists and all

44:25.182 --> 44:30.447
that. You thought, oh my God, let me get away from 
this guy. He's going to get me killed. You know? But

44:36.507 --> 44:43.176
I'd say that probably 1970 the attitude was just do 
your time and go. Did you see any racial problems?

44:49.204 --> 44:51.688
Yeah. You're talking about between American 
soldiers? Blacks. Blacks and whites, yes. There

44:57.636 --> 45:00.440
was a good deal of racial problems. Why, I never 
really understand. There was just a good deal of

45:04.205 --> 45:05.907
it. I really don't understand why, to tell you the 
truth. I never really thought about it. I just know

45:13.190 --> 45:15.653
that it existed. Fighting? There would be some 
fighting sometimes, but you've got to

45:17.275 --> 45:25.364
understand, people in the military, if they don't 
have anybody else to fight, they'll fight amongst

45:17.275 --> 45:25.364
themselves, too.

45:27.066 --> 45:30.230
So, I mean, you had to discount it somewhat there. 
There was... I don't think there was any like...

45:38.000 --> 45:42.085
Anybody that would want to just fight just because 
this guy was black. Although there may have been,

45:43.166 --> 45:45.048
you know. I really never thought about it, you 
know. I know it existed. I saw fighting between the

45:48.032 --> 45:50.115
races. I saw lots of racial slurs. I saw 
Confederate flags. You know, I just really never

45:55.902 --> 45:59.586
thought about why. What type of reactions from the 
public, your family, and your friends did you

46:01.743 --> 46:08.491
receive when I came home? Not real good. Oh,

46:11.214 --> 46:17.141
that's great. I can remember when I came back, I was 
in San Francisco, and we were in the airport, and,

46:18.243 --> 46:31.058
you know, we were in our uniform and all that, and, 
you know, We thought it was going to be like at the

46:31.561 --> 46:36.628
end of World War II. America's soldiers coming 
home. We're going to get ticker tape. People are

46:40.553 --> 46:41.775
going to be proud of us. I remember a girl that 
walked up to me. Like I said, I was a medic. She

46:49.846 --> 46:52.590
walked up and she was extremely belligerent. And 
she kept asking, how many people did you kill? How

46:56.065 --> 46:57.968
many babies did you burn? How many women did you 
ban? How many women did you rape? And I thought,

47:01.994 --> 47:04.518
what the hell is this woman talking about? And then 
the attitude was a lot more. My family, you know. My

47:14.153 --> 47:16.475
mother was real proud. Her boy had made it home for 
one reason. She would take me around to see all her

47:19.879 --> 47:22.001
friends. All I just wanted to do was quiet time.

47:29.169 --> 47:34.534
She would take me around to see all her friends like 
a little animal in a zoo or something. Some of them

47:35.555 --> 47:42.743
would be happy and some of them would look at me like 
this is one of them killers over there.
