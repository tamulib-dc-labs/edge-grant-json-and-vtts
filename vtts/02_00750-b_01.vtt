00:03.153 --> 00:20.071
First, Mr. Leeper, tell us something about your 
early life, including the names of your parents,

00:03.153 --> 00:20.071
the dates of their birth and death, the places of 
their birth, the place and date of your birth, and

00:03.153 --> 00:20.071
the schools you attended before going to Texas 
A&M. Well, like I say, my father was born in

00:20.091 --> 00:23.874
Tennessee. He was born in 1846.

00:27.618 --> 00:31.202
And my mother was born down here in Parker County. 
You know where Weatherford is? She was born in

00:33.799 --> 00:38.323
Weatherford. See, my father, he died in 1924. He 
was 79, right at 79. And my mother died in 1922, and

00:46.170 --> 00:55.582
she was around 52 when she died. He was quite a bit 
older than she was. So that's what you want to know.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.231
Yeah, now, were they married in Weatherford? So 
his family moved to Texas from Tennessee sometime

01:03.734 --> 01:09.643
after he was born. No, no. He was, like I say, he was 
born in Tennessee and in military school and ran

01:11.486 --> 01:23.344
off from military school and joined the 
Confederate Army, old Nathan Forrest Cavalry.

01:24.206 --> 01:25.908
You've heard of Forrest Raiders, I guess. Yeah. He 
was in Nathan Forrest Cavalry. He was about 16. and

01:32.557 --> 02:00.893
he went through the Civil War and then he 
afterwards went to St. Louis and things got pretty

01:32.557 --> 02:00.893
rough there you know after that

01:32.557 --> 02:00.893
reconstruction so he went to St. Louis and he was in 
the grain business in St. Louis and for some reason

01:32.557 --> 02:00.893
he left there and then he come out to Texas he had a 
charge of Singer Showing Machine Company for that

01:32.557 --> 02:00.893
is he was a an agent for the Singer Sewing Machine 
Company for four or five years.

02:09.399 --> 02:11.842
He quit that and come over to Weatherford and put in 
a business. I think he came to Weatherford in 1878.

02:16.827 --> 02:18.009
What kind of business was that? Well, he sold 
sewing machines and organs and sugar mills and old

02:19.010 --> 02:30.643
bicycles. uh all kinds of musical instruments and 
like that see and then he had a farm too had

02:30.944 --> 02:58.875
afterwards as i grew up he had a couple of farms out 
in the country he used to rent them and uh that was uh

02:30.944 --> 02:58.875
that was a kind of he just stayed with it you know 
like all these old fellas did till he went broke

02:30.944 --> 02:58.875
that's the way they used to do it and then the good 
road came in from fort worth and that uh killed a

02:59.581 --> 03:01.283
small town. Weatherford at one time was one of the 
biggest jobbing centers in even bigger than Fort

03:02.625 --> 03:11.076
Worth at one time. They used to do business all out 
here in the west as far as Abilene and Pecos, even

03:11.377 --> 03:16.864
Pecos. They had four big jobbing houses, 
wholesale grocers there in Weatherford at one

03:17.625 --> 03:24.113
time. Did they ship out by rail? Shipped by rail. 
Always. There's no other way, you see. And then you

03:30.509 --> 03:32.512
were born in Weatherford? I was born in 
Weatherford. And when was that? I was born in 1899,

03:34.855 --> 03:38.620
October the 7th. I'm nearly 75 now. You went 
through all the school that they had in

03:41.383 --> 03:44.287
Weatherford then? Yeah, I went to high school 
there, Weatherford High School. And then I went to

03:47.471 --> 03:49.354
A&M from there. How did you happen to choose A&M? 
Well, I'll tell you. My dad used to have... had

03:57.935 --> 03:59.157
standard bred horses. He raised standard bred 
horses. That's trotting horses, see. So he used to

04:03.764 --> 04:05.607
race them over at the Dallas Fair. They had 
trotting races over there. So I was a little old

04:09.694 --> 04:12.618
kid, you know. I guess about 12 years old, 
something like that. So he was German, and he

04:15.803 --> 04:22.033
believed in Disneyland, you know. He was great for 
it. when he told me to do anything I didn't I might

04:24.310 --> 04:46.150
ask questions but I asked questions after I did it 
see that's the way they raised them then and when I

04:24.310 --> 04:46.150
if I was in a room and somebody come in I popped up out 
of that chair and I stood there and I had my chair and

04:24.310 --> 04:46.150
all that and when my mother went calling why I sat 
over in the corner in the chair, and I didn't make a

04:46.838 --> 04:51.002
peep until somebody spoke to me. See, that's the 
way the kids were brought up, that is, most of them.

04:56.648 --> 05:08.139
And so anyway, we were over there one time at this 
racetrack, and A&M

04:56.648 --> 05:08.139
Cadet Corps happened to be there. They were the 
ferry, you know, and they were one of the

05:08.159 --> 05:13.665
attractions. So they put on a drill out there, and 
they in the center of the racetrack, you know. And

05:19.490 --> 05:26.197
it impressed him, and he says, boy, he says, that's 
a pretty good school. He says, I want you to go

05:26.237 --> 05:29.860
there. So that's his decision, see. And of course, 
it was my decision, too. I liked it. And we had a

05:37.027 --> 05:39.509
great school in 23. And it'll never be repeated. So 
the military aspect was... He was in military

05:46.184 --> 05:48.627
school. His parents were pretty well off, you 
know, in Tennessee. They sent him to military

05:51.370 --> 05:54.254
school, sent all the boys to military school. So 
that appealed to both of you then? Well, it

05:56.176 --> 05:57.437
appealed to me, yeah. I liked it. I'd heard him talk 
about the Civil War, you know. He was a great guy. He

06:03.564 --> 06:05.927
never believed in pampering anybody. The tougher 
anything was... He expected you to do it. That was

06:11.480 --> 06:12.441
all. He lived hard. He didn't give a damn. He lived 
hard. He didn't believe in pampering anybody. In

06:22.231 --> 06:32.482
other words, he was out there and the horse pitched 
you off and he'd tell you to get up and get back on it.

06:32.502 --> 06:33.543
That's the way it is. What were your first 
reactions to the school when you got there? Well, I

06:39.344 --> 06:44.512
just fell in with the boys, you know. It's far 
different from what it is now. There's a lot of

06:48.017 --> 06:49.219
paddles around. I presume you arrived by train? 
Oh, sure. We got there at 4 o'clock in the afternoon

06:54.147 --> 06:57.712
on what they used to call the Jenny. The 4 o'clock 
Jenny. Houston, what is that? Houston and Texas

07:02.079 --> 07:05.103
Central, I believe. That's right. Anyway, we 
called it the Jenny. One of them come in at 3

07:08.302 --> 07:17.813
o'clock, and another one come in at 4 o'clock, and 
another one come in about 4 o'clock in the morning,

07:08.302 --> 07:17.813
3, 4 o'clock in the morning. Was there anybody 
there to meet you? Oh, hell no. No? Oh, we didn't.

07:23.220 --> 07:26.063
That stuff, that stuff's old. That's 
new-fashioned stuff. Well, I was wondering, some

07:28.266 --> 07:33.212
of the people who were there about your time said 
they were upperclassmen there to meet you. and to

07:33.580 --> 07:40.911
escort you back to campus or to recruit you to live 
in a particular dormitory or something. Is

07:40.931 --> 07:43.776
somebody that was there when I was? Yeah. Huh? 
Yeah. Were there any students to meet the train,

07:45.979 --> 07:49.885
upperclassmen students? Well, I was a little 
early, I guess. And so... I got off the train there

08:01.289 --> 08:05.295
at four o'clock in the afternoon, I think it was 
somewhere around there. I remember there were

08:05.756 --> 08:13.728
some engineers, these summer engineers, you 
know, they were out surveying. I was early. I was

08:15.972 --> 08:28.832
earlier

08:15.972 --> 08:28.832
than ordinarily I would be if I had followed 
schedule, but I went down there a little early.

08:30.382 --> 08:52.720
We went up that old

08:30.382 --> 08:52.720
main drag, you know, down to the, up to the 
administration building and those engineers

08:30.382 --> 08:52.720
were out there and I remember they had one, two, 
three, four, one, two, three, four of these. So

08:52.741 --> 08:53.622
then there's some The farther I got, I met some boys 
with paddles, and they were slapping those

08:54.293 --> 09:01.480
paddles on their legs, you know. And so we got on up 
to the dormitory. Hell, we didn't know where. I had

09:09.909 --> 09:13.032
a couple of boys from my hometown with me. So we 
didn't know what to do, and so we spent the first

09:14.133 --> 09:20.579
night in Goodwin Hall, old Goodwin Hall. Where do 
you weigh them up? And you mentioned you spent the

09:23.740 --> 09:26.443
first night in Goodwin Hall. I was in Goodwin Hall. 
That's where I spent the first night. And I

09:29.986 --> 09:39.015
remember I had all my bedding and everything 
packed up in my trunk.

09:40.637 --> 09:42.539
And the trunk was on the road, see? And so I didn't 
have anything but a suitcase. And so we spent the

09:45.982 --> 09:50.367
first night in Goodwin Hall and didn't have any 
sheets and anything. So we just slept in our

09:50.387 --> 09:53.730
clothes. So the next day, we registered. And 
finally, I picked a boy from Weatherford as my

09:58.653 --> 10:06.624
roommate, a boy named Byron. We called him Goat 
Byron, old Goat Byron. He's still down there in

10:09.007 --> 10:10.809
Weatherford. Retired from the Dallas Power and 
Light. Engineer, mechanical engineer. So

10:18.160 --> 10:24.308
we spent the first night there in Weatherford. And 
you remember hearing them talk about old Casey?

10:28.010 --> 10:29.752
Casey's confectioner, yeah. Casey's 
confectioner. Well, we got up the next morning and

10:31.274 --> 10:36.181
went in there and ate breakfast. And old Casey, he 
had that chew of the back of his mouth, you know. And

10:39.385 --> 10:41.487
he had one eye, you know, Casey did. Some defect in 
his eye here. But he was a character, old Casey was.

10:47.535 --> 10:52.742
Well, then we got in Milner Hall. put up in Milner 
Hall, and as I say, we were the first, long first to

10:53.633 --> 11:02.306
get there, and we had a thick of a room, see. So we run 
over and looked at the things over, and we picked

11:04.089 --> 11:14.746
out a nice room on the second floor of Milner Hall, 
corner room, see. So we were just fixed up pretty

11:14.766 --> 11:16.789
good. So about the second night we were there, 
about 3 o'clock in the morning, we heard the

11:17.545 --> 11:26.959
biggest tail raising you ever heard coming up 
those steel stairs. And somebody

11:28.321 --> 11:34.310
coming running in there. You know, it was 
summertime. We never thought anything about

11:35.392 --> 11:38.456
closing the door. And somebody coming running in 
there. And he says, here's a couple of fish in here,

11:41.901 --> 11:46.388
in our room. And you remember, you've heard about 
old Cop Forsyth? Yeah. Well, Cop's brother made

11:54.748 --> 12:00.034
that big donation, you know, to the college, 
$300,000. Yeah. And that was old Cop's brother,

12:00.495 --> 12:07.182
kid brother. Yeah. And he was a sophomore that 
year. So he rousted us out of there. You talk about

12:14.431 --> 12:16.493
getting met at the station, that's... He rousted 
us out of there pretty quick. So he told us out of

12:20.141 --> 12:22.484
their room. Of course, it's against the rules 
then, you know, for any freshman to get in the

12:22.504 --> 12:27.149
corner room. That was a bad breach of etiquette. A 
freshman had to be in one of these middle rooms. So

12:35.820 --> 12:43.308
old cop, he run us out of that room about 3 o'clock, 
about when the genie come in, the 3 o'clock genie,

12:35.820 --> 12:43.308
run us out of that room. He and old Stovall, there's 
a fellow named J.T. Stovall, Well, you ever heard

12:47.033 --> 12:49.996
of him or not, old J.T.? I don't think so. He's dead 
now. So is Cop, I think. Now, Cop's still alive. The

12:55.222 --> 12:58.106
young Cop, little Cop. Well, the one I know is Cop 
Forsyth, class of 13 or something like that. Well,

13:04.212 --> 13:05.294
that's his brother. That's his brother. And that 
was the original Cop, see?

13:13.183 --> 13:17.007
I might be talking out of school now, but I don't 
want to... get mixed up maybe in something i don't

13:17.290 --> 13:42.268
know about but this they call little cop oh he was a 
young he was he was a sophomore and he'd had an older

13:17.290 --> 13:42.268
brother there named

13:17.290 --> 13:42.268
a cop and i don't know whether it's this one that 
donated to school or not but the tradition went the

13:17.290 --> 13:42.268
story went that when the a m defeated texas in uh I 
believe it was 1912, 1911, sometime back there.

13:47.144 --> 13:48.386
That wouldn't be the exact date. They used to have a 
big old steer, you know, a longhorn steer for a

13:48.406 --> 13:51.871
mascot. So they got this longhorn steer and 
branded him 18-6. What was the score? I forget. I

14:00.002 --> 14:00.963
believe they branded him 13-0. 13-0. Yeah, that's 
it. 13-0. You're right. 13-0. So... They were

14:08.084 --> 14:19.881
raising hell there in town, you know, that night 
and so some of these old policemen used to wear

14:08.084 --> 14:19.881
these long coats and helmets and so forth. So the 
story went that the policemen started to arrest

14:19.901 --> 14:25.890
some of these boys and so they just threw him down, 
stripped his clothes off, stripped his uniform

14:26.174 --> 14:37.380
off, and the old cop dressed up, and he acted as a 
policeman, so that's where he got the name of cop.

14:37.400 --> 14:37.901
Oh, I see. That was a tradition when I was there, 
see. And so his little brother, his younger

14:43.538 --> 14:46.363
brother was Little Cop. Little Cop. See, when that 
fellow went to school there, and his name was Cop,

14:47.665 --> 15:01.328
then the next, the next, not generation, but the 
next kin that come there, he automatically became

14:47.665 --> 15:01.328
Little Cop, see. Like there's a Big Hig and a Little 
Hig. Old Little Hig, he was there when I was there,

15:04.694 --> 15:09.839
you know, and he was a big athlete and a big halfback 
there. And Big Hig was about three, four years

15:09.859 --> 15:13.783
before him. So anyway, we got run out of that room, 
and then we found us a room down the hall a little

15:14.163 --> 15:23.292
ways, and that's where we put up for the rest of the 
time. So that's the kind of, and so we became then, I

15:24.233 --> 15:30.960
was the top fish, I was old Stovall's fish, and this 
other boy was Byron. He was old Cop's fish. So we had

15:37.879 --> 15:42.163
to go down every morning, clean out the room for 
him, sweep it up. And he'd tell us, I don't want any

15:42.183 --> 15:46.126
ram fish. Get that room clean. Well, that was our 
job. We had to clean up the room, wash the wash

15:49.489 --> 15:55.394
basin, and all like that every morning after 
breakfast before class. And that's the way to run

15:56.155 --> 15:58.177
things. Did you have to clean the rifle, too? clean 
the rifles. Every Saturday morning for

16:00.527 --> 16:03.010
inspection, we had to clean the rifles. And they 
had to stay in inspection every Saturday. And if it

16:10.239 --> 16:18.308
was, sometimes it was room inspection, something 
come up, maybe they didn't want to have them. So

16:18.328 --> 16:20.151
they had room inspection. We had to be, we were, we 
did guard duty. We'd run at walk post. And all that

16:29.463 --> 16:33.649
sort of thing, drilled three times a week. And that 
is Tuesday we drilled, and Thursday we drilled,

16:35.391 --> 16:51.733
and then Saturday we either had an inspection or 
had a review on the, an inspection on the parade

16:35.391 --> 16:51.733
grounds, a review. So it was a mighty fine school.

16:59.230 --> 17:02.213
Did you stay in Milner Hall the whole time you were 
there? No. I was in Milner Hall my freshman year,

17:04.355 --> 17:20.411
and then my roommate got assigned to my roommate 
and I got assigned to E Company, and E Company was up

17:04.355 --> 17:20.411
in Bazell. So I roomed in Bazell the rest of the 
time. Those two were both fairly new, Don and

17:24.376 --> 17:26.858
Fuente. Well, they just finished Brazell. And 
when I went there as a freshman, they just finished

17:30.858 --> 17:34.462
the previous year. And that was the brand newest 
thing on the campus was Brazell Hall. That was a

17:38.606 --> 17:39.346
nice hall. So you had convenient showers and 
bathrooms and all that sort of stuff in those.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.595
Well, it's a. You had them on each floor anyway. 
Yeah, we had them on. We did the same thing in

17:51.558 --> 17:52.679
Milton. We had latrines, we called it, on each 
floor. How was the life in those dormitories? Was

17:59.986 --> 18:04.852
it pretty hectic or pretty well controlled or how 
would you describe it? It's nothing like it is now.

18:06.975 --> 18:07.616
Oh, hell no. We had discipline, you know. We had 
call to quarters every night. I

18:13.283 --> 18:22.714
think, as well as I recollect, it was either 7 or 
7.15 was call to quarters. Well, 7 was call to

18:22.754 --> 18:24.857
quarters and then we had room inspection. We had to 
be in a room by 7.15. And then we had a fellow sent in a

18:29.227 --> 18:34.214
walking post on each floor. And if you wanted to go 
out for anything, you had to holler for him and ask

18:34.815 --> 18:42.285
his permission to go with the latrine or something 
like that, or toilet. And you couldn't go out to the

18:43.487 --> 18:49.175
library or stuff like that unless you got 
permission. You had to have permission to go out.

18:52.299 --> 18:52.920
Freshmen He could get one pass a month to Brian. A 
sophomore could get one pass a week. And a junior

19:01.406 --> 19:03.868
could go every Saturday when he wanted to. And a 
senior could go anytime he wanted to. Go anywhere.

19:09.854 --> 19:11.775
And the seniors run the school. He could go 
anywhere he had enough money to go. Well, he

19:14.318 --> 19:16.840
couldn't just take off. In other words, if he 
wanted to run down to Navasota, Why, in my senior

19:21.858 --> 19:43.731
year down there, why,

19:21.858 --> 19:43.731
my company captain and his 12 more seniors went 
down to Navasota, got in one of those whorehouses

19:21.858 --> 19:43.731
down there and got drunk. And they found it out, and 
they canned every one of them. They wouldn't have

19:50.100 --> 19:51.342
done that now, would they? I doubt it. Too 
soft-hearted. Every one of them got canned right

19:54.800 --> 19:59.385
just a few days before Christmas. They were about 
half a year from graduating. Half a year from

20:02.988 --> 20:04.390
graduating. Did they allow any of them to come 
back, or did they can them permanently? No, sir.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.256
They kind of canned them for all the time to come. 
None of them ever came back at all. Had I ever heard

20:12.959 --> 20:14.601
of them. I remember Bob Easton was my company 
commander. Did that cause any kind of disturbance

20:16.943 --> 20:20.027
among the rest of the students? No, no. There's 
three things you mustn't do. You mustn't gamble.

20:25.162 --> 20:26.483
You mustn't get drunk. You mustn't cheat. You 
mustn't steal. And

20:31.009 --> 20:35.034
those are three things. That is, those are the 
things that you must not do. That is, under the

20:40.761 --> 20:43.905
penalty of being expelled. They caught you 
gambling, playing poker. They raided the poker

20:46.508 --> 20:47.590
room. Every fellow... in that room got canned, 
whether he was playing poker or not. Just watch it.

20:54.207 --> 20:54.928
He got canned. And if you got drunk, they found it 
out, you got the tag. Well, they don't do that today

21:05.002 --> 21:10.349
for sure because I think most of them had beer in 
their rooms. That's right. Well, I say, we had a

21:11.731 --> 21:13.073
school. We had a school. Now, don't forget it, 
boys. 2,300 cadets. And we had discipline. We

21:19.060 --> 21:19.921
walked posts. And we did drill. We went to summer 
camp. And everybody had to take military

21:26.427 --> 21:29.790
training. Did upperclassmen as well as freshmen 
walk posts? Oh, no, no. Just the freshmen walked

21:34.555 --> 21:35.936
the posts? No, just the freshmen. And that was only 
inside the dormitories, wasn't it? Yeah, inside.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.342
In other words, you're supposed to keep these kids 
in their room. Yeah. They couldn't leave their

21:43.964 --> 21:47.087
room unless they got permission from you. We had 
the sergeant of the guard and all that kind of

21:47.641 --> 21:51.685
stuff, you know. Officer of the day. Officer of the 
day, yeah, we had an officer of the day every day.

21:56.890 --> 22:00.934
Was it the officer of the day who inspected the 
rooms? Or was it the company commander? No, the

22:02.255 --> 22:07.120
room inspection was, we had an old sergeant down 
there, he called him Sergeant Smart. And he had

22:08.662 --> 22:11.925
some assistance. We had some of these old-time 
army sergeants down there, but... As a rule, old

22:16.936 --> 22:21.707
Sergeant Smart went around every morning and 
inspected the room, see. He found a dirty wash

22:21.727 --> 22:28.763
basin, a bed unmade, or anything, dust, dirt on the 
floor, or anything. In other words, the room

22:28.843 --> 22:31.509
wasn't tidy. You got a red slip in the mailbox. 
Mm-hmm. If you was a freshman and you was cleaning

22:34.773 --> 22:40.525
that upperclassman's room, you got the paddle. 
The upperclassman got the ram, but you got the

22:41.227 --> 22:43.652
paddle. You got the paddle. How did they work it, 
say, if there were two of you in the room and the wash

22:45.416 --> 22:51.128
basin was dirty, you both got a ram? Both of us got 
around. But if just one bed was messed up, why,

22:53.707 --> 22:56.791
who's every bed it was got around? It didn't make 
any difference whose bed it was. That room got

22:59.353 --> 23:00.995
around. That room got around. Did they read that 
list at the mess hall at night? No. No, you just got a

23:07.522 --> 23:11.606
red flip, and that gave you so many demerits. Well, 
if I remember right, 125 demerits in one semester,

23:11.626 --> 23:16.812
they sent you home. If you missed retreat, you 
missed formation, any kind of a formation, well,

23:18.918 --> 23:25.669
you got a ram. You got a ram clip. Well, if you got 
the, I think it was 125. I've still got my old blue

23:31.618 --> 23:35.003
buck in there. How could you reduce the number you 
had? Couldn't reduce them. Hell, that was

23:38.812 --> 23:41.095
permanent. Well, there was a point at one time 
where you could work on the grounds or something

23:41.135 --> 23:46.362
for the school and reduce the range. Well, I know 
that's where the liberality first came. Or you

23:49.787 --> 23:52.651
could march in the bullring and reduce them. Well, 
they didn't have anything like that then.

23:59.755 --> 24:02.822
There are different ways you got a demerit. If you 
missed flash, you cut flash, you got a demerit. If

24:05.388 --> 24:07.914
you missed formation, you got a demerit. If your 
room was untidy, you got a demerit. If your gun was

24:09.839 --> 24:13.287
dirty at inspection, you got a demerit. I don't 
know what the number was, but a certain number for

24:13.588 --> 24:17.798
each fence. If you got the magic number, you were 
out. That's right. You went home. You couldn't

24:25.590 --> 24:28.994
come back until the next semester. You had to get 
out on your knees and say a prayer before they let

24:29.014 --> 24:33.560
you in there. What was the food like in the mess 
hall? Good. It was all right. Old freezer stuff, we

24:38.286 --> 24:39.968
called it. It was all right. Was it kind of 
monotonous at times? Well, I wouldn't say that.

24:45.835 --> 24:46.616
They fed us good. We had chili, and we had bull 
necks, and we had plenty of bread, and we had

24:46.716 --> 24:51.741
cereal. It was all right. Just plain, wholesome 
food, you see. It was all right. We had a table

24:57.367 --> 25:01.212
style, and they had Mexican waiters bring us the 
food. We sat 12 men at the table. And the

25:03.634 --> 25:07.999
upperclassman, he always had the end chair at the 
head of the table. They had an upperclassman at the

25:08.019 --> 25:10.802
head of the table. and had one at their foot. And 
when we went in, well, we stood at attention until

25:13.631 --> 25:21.807
all the corps was in. And then the colonel gave the 
command, take seats. We took seats. But before you

25:29.041 --> 25:43.697
took seats, why then you wanted to see that each 
upperclassman, maybe sometimes there was a

25:29.041 --> 25:43.697
sophomore, maybe a junior sergeant at the head of 
the table, maybe a sergeant at the foot, maybe a

25:29.041 --> 25:43.697
sophomore seat. You wanted to be pretty sure that 
those glasses were all filled with water or iced

25:44.177 --> 25:52.166
tea or whatever they wanted before you sat down. 
And they were well served and well taken care of.

25:55.889 --> 26:04.844
And then when everybody was helped, the 
sophomores or the upperclassmen helped

25:55.889 --> 26:04.844
themselves, well, then we dove in and helped 
ourselves. Those things are good for a boy. I know

26:07.128 --> 26:11.456
you marched to every meal in formation. Marched to 
every meal, yes, sir. Did you enter the dining hall

26:12.798 --> 26:16.922
in the same order all the time? In other words, the 
same company go in first all the time? That's

26:19.625 --> 26:19.886
right. We just started in at the head down there. 
Whichever one was closest to the speech hall on the

26:21.988 --> 26:25.772
military walk. They lined up in front of you. You 
know how that main drag was. I mean, the military

26:29.075 --> 26:31.158
walk. You know how that was arranged there. 
Dormitories on each side, so we fell out naturally

26:33.820 --> 26:40.948
to fall out for formation, retreat, and stuff like 
that.

26:42.599 --> 26:43.661
fell out that way. Adjacent to the holes, we 
marched in every day.

26:53.078 --> 26:54.822
Everything was run in the military matters. You 
know that, you probably know this, that A&M

26:54.862 --> 27:02.616
furnished more officers for World War I than the 
two in the United States. Yeah, and I'm not sure, I

27:02.663 --> 27:06.308
believe the same is true for two, World War II. I 
mean World War II, that's what I mean, not World War

27:06.508 --> 27:11.014
I, now I don't know, but World War II. I believe it 
was both of them.

27:15.880 --> 27:23.170
We mentioned a few things earlier that the upper 
classmen could do that the freshmen couldn't,

27:15.880 --> 27:23.170
like they could go to town more often and and they 
had freshmen to do things for them, and they got

27:23.437 --> 27:30.388
served first in the dining hall and that sort of 
stuff. Were there any other privileges that the

27:30.408 --> 27:33.112
upperclassmen had?

27:37.819 --> 27:50.659
Well, they had all the privileges that were graded 
by,

27:37.819 --> 27:50.659
as I told you, it started from the sophomore. Of 
course, he had the first bottom privilege, and

27:51.061 --> 27:56.429
then it went on up to the senior. And he had the 
senior. I guess you suppose he—I would say he had

27:57.590 --> 28:03.659
all the privileges.

28:04.320 --> 28:08.185
What did you do for entertainment and recreation? 
Oh, we didn't suffer that. Played poker and

28:11.049 --> 28:17.338
blackjack and behind the locked doors and— And we 
had a theater every Saturday night, a picture show

28:17.960 --> 28:24.213
down there. We went to that, and then we had dances. 
Was that a picture show in the old air dome? Well,

28:29.885 --> 28:31.728
there's an old wooden shack they had there. I don't 
know what they called it. I think it was the air

28:32.831 --> 28:34.053
dome. Yeah, it was built out of wood. Was that over 
there across from the YMCA? Yeah, that's back

28:38.752 --> 28:42.036
right in front of the YMCA. Yeah, I believe that was 
the old air dome. Yeah, that's what they called it,

28:45.080 --> 28:47.002
I guess, the air dome. It wasn't a very big 
building. We had these movies over there. And we

28:51.348 --> 28:55.113
had lots of fun, you know. We went berry hunting, 
and we went out to the fish tank. You know where the

29:01.141 --> 29:03.604
fish tank is? No. No? A bunch of sportsmen started 
that way back, and that's where they used to take

29:04.923 --> 29:16.259
the fish out there and dump them and throw them in 
that fish tank, and that's where it got its name,

29:04.923 --> 29:16.259
the fish tank. Where was it, say, from the 
administration building, if you went across the

29:18.182 --> 29:24.231
railroad tracks down that direction?

29:26.759 --> 29:28.121
The fish tank? Yeah. Yeah, it was out there on the 
other side of the way, out in the country there.

29:32.627 --> 29:38.295
That was about, I'd say, about four miles, as far as 
I recollect, about four miles from Bryant. There

29:38.936 --> 29:40.979
was no tank out there, just a lake. They called it a 
lake. I think a bunch of sportsmen started it, and

29:42.982 --> 29:46.707
maybe it was abandoned, I don't know. But we used to 
go swimming out there, and...

29:51.768 --> 29:54.474
There's a lot of blackberries out in that part of 
the woods. We used to go out there and just rove

29:54.514 --> 29:57.179
around. We had a lot of wholesome, we had a more 
wholesome form of living than these people have

29:58.282 --> 30:03.813
now, you know. I guess it's that way all over the 
country.
