WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:17.905
drastic change because it was it was very of course 
they had that year of interim yeah and you sort of

00:01.803 --> 00:17.905
you know i floundered around for that one year and 
uh but um would you but you were really you more or

00:01.803 --> 00:17.905
less kept kept it the way hubert Or were you 
somewhere in between the two? I would have to say I

00:21.203 --> 00:32.817
had to be somewhere in between the two, because I 
recognized that in the position I played, I could

00:21.203 --> 00:32.817
not say, there it is, and that's where we're going, 
because I was not going to be around any length of

00:21.203 --> 00:32.817
time to see if we got there. So it was definitely a 
period of time where the college wallowed around,

00:33.658 --> 00:40.806
and we did the best we could with what we had.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.732
Did you get very much input? participation from 
Hubert after he became chancellor? No, no, no. And

00:51.560 --> 00:57.249
he is not that type of individual. If you had come up 
and wanted to get some information, he would be

00:57.930 --> 01:05.181
only too glad to provide it. I can recall, I don't 
know if you were sitting right there, when we went

01:05.221 --> 01:14.875
up on another matter one time, I can't remember 
exactly what it was, but he He was very interested

01:15.243 --> 01:25.677
in having

01:15.243 --> 01:25.677
Cole come up there and work for him. And I 
recognized that

01:25.697 --> 01:38.213
Cole was the individual that would carry and give 
the continuity to many of the things in the dean's

01:25.697 --> 01:38.213
office. His experiences date back to when he was a 
graduate student and worked in the dean's office

01:38.885 --> 01:52.545
when we were over there in the Cushing Library 
building and that type of thing.

01:55.108 --> 02:02.058
But Dean Hubert, who he could have, of course, and 
explained very nicely, Phil, that he's coming up

01:55.108 --> 02:02.058
here. I want him, period. After all, that is the 
chancellor we're talking to. But he asked my

02:06.104 --> 02:10.650
opinion, and I gave him my opinion, and he honored 
it. He let him study, and I'm pleased that he did. I

02:15.396 --> 02:29.715
think the college would be in a

02:15.396 --> 02:29.715
difficult position if there was not what I call the 
continuity. That somebody has the historical

02:30.050 --> 02:32.292
background. And from my interview with Dean Cole, 
I asked him about that because I have heard from

02:32.432 --> 02:41.341
other interviews that a lot of the 
decision-making goes to him. And he said that the

02:41.381 --> 02:47.127
dean does seek his counsel in a lot of the decisions 
and usually listens. And I think that's good

02:47.187 --> 02:50.330
because he feels that there is that. No. And Hubert 
always did the same. As far as when you got up there

02:54.614 --> 02:58.538
and you were on his staff, This guidance was very 
clear. That's your area. You were what Dean Coles,

03:04.115 --> 03:08.101
in Dean Coles' position as Dr. Hubert. Yes, yes. 
Which is the Student Affairs. That's right, the

03:10.305 --> 03:11.767
Student Affairs. And Hubert was very clear and, 
Bill, that's yours. You handle it. If you have need

03:16.134 --> 03:20.160
of my assistance, come visit with me. And I would go 
to see him on sensitive political things, you

03:20.180 --> 03:27.512
know, when state senators wanted their kid to get 
in and this kind of thing. Generally speaking, it

03:27.847 --> 03:30.010
was very interesting. You would tell them to go 
blow it, and stand behind you, and Prescott would

03:30.030 --> 03:45.814
stand behind you, and Calhoun would stand behind 
you, and we would tell them, sorry, but that isn't

03:30.030 --> 03:45.814
the way the university operates. At other times, 
there were other political decisions that never

03:45.834 --> 03:53.466
reached the confrontation type of thing, but were 
done in a A typical style. It was done all behind,

03:55.508 --> 03:57.750
sub rosa. And you were presented with what the 
French called fait accompli. Okay. How do you feel

04:05.418 --> 04:09.962
that the college was perceived by outsiders at the 
time? And by outsiders, I mean maybe within Texas

04:10.022 --> 04:15.267
A&M or even beyond. Was there... College of 
Education, notoriously. Everyone that I've been

04:20.292 --> 04:21.934
associated with. They're usually looked down 
upon by the colleges of liberal arts. We were more

04:29.385 --> 04:30.788
fortunate here. There is still that. And I see 
evidences of it creeping back up again. And the

04:36.777 --> 04:42.606
state, of course, is assisting in that kind of 
putting it down type of thing. But the reason I say I

04:42.626 --> 04:49.457
think we were more fortunate, you know the history 
in that Dean Hubert was the dean of liberal arts.

04:49.825 --> 04:54.870
And he had the opportunity to continue the dean of 
liberal arts or to continue, help to move over. And

04:55.350 --> 05:03.118
he chose to take over the College of Education, 
which, of course, gave us a tremendous boost in the

04:55.350 --> 05:03.118
eyes of the rest of the faculty. And he knew where 
all the skeletons were in most of the colleges,

05:03.138 --> 05:08.523
having formed many of the colleges. So that we rode 
along very nicely for a fair time. How we are today,

05:19.610 --> 05:24.436
I really do not know. But of course, the state has 
taken such a hatchet swing at us that I don't see how

05:25.878 --> 05:42.420
we can be counted to be able to hold our heads up and 
be looked upon by our colleagues as where we think

05:25.878 --> 05:42.420
we should be. Were you instrumental in being this 
acting dean in the search and the ultimate

05:50.002 --> 05:51.364
selection of Dean Corrigan? Other than, other 
than as a member of the college,

05:52.065 --> 06:09.829
the search committee was basically given free 
reign.

06:11.972 --> 06:19.502
Eskimo Monroe, I think, was dean of faculties, and 
I think he was the chairman of the or ex officio or

06:19.972 --> 06:23.297
something like that. And it was strictly a 
decision on the part of that committee, a

06:23.317 --> 06:31.908
recommendation. The faculty were given a voice in 
it, but the decision basically was one up at that

06:33.811 --> 06:45.827
committee level. I see nothing wrong with that 
process. I would prefer to have that type of

06:49.515 --> 07:00.909
process than one where a faculty has the sole 
decision and the university is not involved in it.

07:01.990 --> 07:08.358
I think the university does a good job of bringing 
in and giving everybody an opportunity to express

07:01.990 --> 07:08.358
opinions. We had some good quality people, 
excellent people. One of the perceptions from a

07:12.903 --> 07:15.426
faculty member having worked under both, that 
when the Corrigan administration took over,

07:16.537 --> 07:33.218
there was more opportunities for faculty to, I 
believe she put it something about being more

07:16.537 --> 07:33.218
creative, having an opportunity to expand, 
whatever. How do you feel about that? I would tend

07:34.820 --> 07:45.413
to agree in that being Corrigan always has a 
tendency to encourage an individual to do these

07:34.820 --> 07:45.413
things. the individual faculty member is 
encouraged to be creative. His or her opinions are

07:54.271 --> 07:57.836
sought.

08:00.980 --> 08:13.476
The other side of the coin is

08:00.980 --> 08:13.476
if you have 50 people going in 50 different 
directions, when do you get the focus? to this type

08:13.827 --> 08:16.850
of thing. And these are just problems that an

08:16.930 --> 08:24.979
administration has to wrestle with. What is the 
role of setting the overall arching goal of this

08:25.599 --> 08:33.347
type of thing and then fitting into this? How many 
years did you work under Dean Corbyn?

08:39.274 --> 08:43.378
He came in 1980.

08:44.590 --> 08:49.456
I retired the first time under, I retired. He

08:50.077 --> 09:09.640
asked me to stay on half the time with him, and I 
stayed half the time with him until 84, I think, and

08:50.077 --> 09:09.640
that's when they asked me to go over to the 
National. And you were also very instrumental in

09:11.742 --> 09:14.266
getting that, was it the NK? Oh, yes. I've seen your 
name on all those reports. That was a big job for

09:17.590 --> 09:18.972
you. That was. And I was very pleased with the 
report they had, because we felt that we had a good

09:19.693 --> 09:29.828
college of education. And the visiting team 
couldn't say enough good things about it. I

09:36.518 --> 09:39.222
believe they're getting ready for another one 
here pretty soon. I'm very pleased. Another set of

09:40.724 --> 09:41.665
hands. OK. Visions. And again, I guess because 
you're not there now, it's hard for you to maybe

09:45.776 --> 09:52.023
have a handle on where the college is going. Have 
you stayed in touch very much, or do you know? No.

09:56.168 --> 10:05.359
I'm of the school that I've seen in so many offices 
where the old guard keeps coming back until they

09:56.168 --> 10:05.359
get to be a boring nuisance. I don't come back. 
Rarely do I come back. I just came back recently

10:08.403 --> 10:10.265
from New England. I brought Dean Corrigan and a 
couple sugar maple leaves for them, you know, this

10:12.661 --> 10:15.364
kind of thing. But I don't get in there because I 
know that there are just a lot of office politics

10:15.384 --> 10:25.615
and things and this type of thing, so I just go. It 
was a nice way of moving away from it when I was

10:27.898 --> 10:38.329
moving into the International for, I don't know, 
two, three years. I can't recall how long it was.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.243
And that way I got away from it. I don't go to the 
Christmas parties anymore and this kind of thing.

10:49.511 --> 10:56.700
I've done a little bit of art in one of the classes, 
653, studying the culture and the climate of the

10:49.511 --> 10:56.700
college. Did that change drastically during your 
time? Because, you know, the sex. We in the college

11:04.629 --> 11:10.056
probably had more women in 69 and 70 than any other 
college. It was a doctoral thing. And I lament the

11:20.110 --> 11:36.547
fact that what was our strong support, which was 
that intelligent young female, has now left and

11:20.110 --> 11:36.547
has gone to business and other places. The 
strength of the College of Education has always

11:36.567 --> 11:39.790
been the quality of the dedicated females that we 
at one time attracted, which we do not anymore. And

11:48.570 --> 11:51.653
it's understandable.

11:53.896 --> 11:57.580
The grass is quite a bit greener than some of the 
other places. Do you think the pendulum is going to

11:58.441 --> 12:00.824
swing back any time? I hope for the youngsters' 
sake that it does. And I don't know what

12:03.948 --> 12:08.173
inducements we will give or what delusionments 
will have to come before they come back. But I'm

12:12.097 --> 12:26.915
biased in that I think a dedicated teacher gets a 
reward of the intrinsic award that you get from it

12:12.097 --> 12:26.915
that you cannot find in many other types of things. 
This is just a garrulous old man, but I feel

12:26.935 --> 12:33.643
strongly about it. Can you talk just for a couple of 
minutes about any particular highlights and are

12:38.782 --> 12:43.609
perhaps your contribution during your time here. 
I'm encountering some reluctance on the part of

12:44.130 --> 12:52.081
interviewees to elaborate on their 
contributions, but an insight, an observation.

12:52.722 --> 12:54.684
You gave me some good anecdotes at the beginning, 
too. Is there something that stands out? Well,

12:58.890 --> 13:02.395
that which you take pride in. I think that which I 
take pride in is the struggle

13:08.954 --> 13:13.839
enhance the image of the college in the university 
community. And you use that medium of exchange,

13:15.060 --> 13:30.517
which is the GPR, as the medium of exchange that you 
can say our students are equal to or better than,

13:15.060 --> 13:30.517
this type of thing. That was a very difficult 
struggle. The associate deans had a group,

13:38.603 --> 14:01.354
we called it the academic, no, I really can't 
recall the name of it, but there was a group that was

13:38.603 --> 14:01.354
set up because there was a need for people to come 
together who were going to actually implement the

13:38.603 --> 14:01.354
decisions that the university APC, or the 
Academic Programs Committee, which was the

14:02.026 --> 14:09.838
president and the vice president, provost now, 
and all this kind of thing, and the deans. They

14:10.840 --> 14:12.062
would make the policy. But as is true of most 
organizations, they didn't really know how to

14:13.324 --> 14:20.354
implement it. And you're not expected to know. But 
the associate deans did. And that was our

14:25.603 --> 14:30.430
organization where we fleshed out and 
implemented those decisions that were made by the

14:30.865 --> 14:33.327
APC. And it was in that organization that the 
struggle was, because they were always trying to

14:33.828 --> 14:45.639
make it easy for their colleges to get rid of their 
deadwood. And we would continually struggle to

14:45.819 --> 14:49.903
prevent them from dumping onto this place. And 
yet, at the same time, want the opportunity to look

14:49.923 --> 14:56.890
at those kids to try to salvage what, in our 
judgment, were useful students. And it's a very

14:58.664 --> 15:01.047
sensitive and delicate thing. And I think it's 
still going on to a large extent. And I think Dean

15:05.212 --> 15:12.841
Cole has had it made more difficult by our 
legislators down there. And I don't know.

15:19.989 --> 15:24.514
In closing, Dr. Lindbacher, is there anything 
that you would like to add? add to the different

15:26.857 --> 15:32.505
areas that we've talked about, even if they're not 
even directly related to any of the questions?

15:32.765 --> 15:46.004
Well, the use of the policy committee meeting, 
either in the archives or in the dean's office.

15:46.906 --> 15:50.090
Hubert's secretary used to be on Peggy Ritchie. 
She's still there, and she's given me a lot of those

15:50.291 --> 15:53.635
documents. That, to me, would be, and they're not 
generally too thick. And if you can get them in

15:59.291 --> 16:04.000
chronological order, things begin to emerge. 
They're just at least their guideposts as to the

16:04.240 --> 16:10.852
direction they were going. It doesn't have all the 
nuances that you would get from a. Was it the

16:16.903 --> 16:19.408
agendas or the minutes that they would be? Oh, the 
minutes. Oh, the minutes. The minutes. The

16:24.247 --> 16:34.783
agendas are useful, but the minutes would give you 
some flavor for the kinds of

16:24.247 --> 16:34.783
actions that took place. I would say that they 
would be very fruitful areas for hanging some of

16:43.773 --> 16:46.157
these ideas that you have on. That's right, 
because what I'm interested in so much, besides

16:46.177 --> 17:07.013
the history, because there hasn't been anything 
since 1967 when Lorraine Roby did the study, but

16:46.177 --> 17:07.013
since then nothing has been done as far as the 
historical, but I'm interested in the

16:46.177 --> 17:07.013
perceptions of people and the human part of the 
college, what really made it made those things

17:07.533 --> 17:18.383
happen, the kinds of personalities, and the 
interaction of personalities, and how all of that

17:07.533 --> 17:18.383
evolved to the great college that there is now. 
Well, I mean, what you're after is, I think, the

17:19.464 --> 17:27.051
interesting aspects of it. But I think there needs 
to be a basic structure that you begin to hang these

17:27.071 --> 17:31.656
things on. Right, exactly. And maybe it's because 
I used to enjoy history You need a historical

17:36.440 --> 17:41.772
thread that would take you through. Now, those 
were initiated by Dean Hubert, and they continued

17:42.513 --> 17:47.123
the same under Dean Corrigan? To my knowledge, 
yes, they continued the same. It's a policy

17:51.393 --> 17:55.562
committee group. I guess now they just call it, is 
it the normal faculty meeting or department head

17:55.643 --> 18:02.052
meeting or whatever? Department head meeting, 
maybe that. I think that's what they call it now.

18:05.817 --> 18:06.598
Department head meeting. I think so. Yeah, they 
called them policy committee meetings at that

18:06.878 --> 18:09.702
time. And that was a weekly? Weekly, weekly. And 
they were legislative. It, you know, it provided

18:20.112 --> 18:25.539
information and it also provided opportunities 
for departments to bring up things that were

18:20.112 --> 18:25.539
bothering them. A lot of my interviews, you know, 
everybody of course relates to the two

18:26.019 --> 18:47.706
administrations and even though the Hubert 
administration is often referred to as

18:26.019 --> 18:47.706
autocratic, dictatorial, there's still a lot of 
that humanness that the people that worked

18:26.019 --> 18:47.706
intimately with Hubert were able to perceive that 
perhaps was not as perceivable. I think anyone who

18:47.956 --> 18:54.423
worked with D. Hubert recognized his ability in 
the professional area. He was outstanding as a

18:54.984 --> 18:59.068
politician. He, having worked in the Texas 
Education Agency, knew the politics in there. He

19:03.633 --> 19:05.836
knew the skeletons. And he, of course, was a very 
close friend of Alton Bowen, who became, as you

19:06.176 --> 19:15.006
know, the commissioner. And Alton is, of course, 
He was also on our first development council. I'll

19:21.558 --> 19:23.422
be going with him. I told him last night. Thank you 
very, very much, Dr. Limbacher. I appreciate your

19:27.430 --> 19:31.699
insights and hope you'll let me ask you some 
questions later.
