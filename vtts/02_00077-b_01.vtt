WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:03.260
Where would you eat? Our favorite places, I guess, 
were, there were about three. There was a, what was

00:06.845 --> 00:12.153
it called down at the, they called it at the 
Triangle. There was a drive-in kind of restaurant

00:12.173 --> 00:14.836
down there. We used to go down there quite a bit. I 
forget the name of it. There was a place that served

00:19.723 --> 00:32.181
huge cheap steaks and catfish out there on the 
Brazos River near the air base. We'd go across to

00:32.988 --> 00:38.054
North Gate, and I forget the name of the restaurant 
where they served those greasy hamburgers. Was

00:39.376 --> 00:43.120
Colonel Ed's Hard Liquor still going? Not that I 
remember. Down in Welborn? A little earlier, that

00:45.323 --> 00:47.385
was a place to go get beer. I don't remember that. 
Was Whiskey Bridge a place where people went in

00:49.528 --> 00:53.853
your era? Go straight toward Snook and 
immediately across the river could buy whiskey?

00:58.038 --> 00:58.819
Never remember that. Maybe they did. I didn't. Was 
beer available? during your era in Brazos County?

01:07.169 --> 01:09.412
You know, I guess I never drank any beer. Never had 
the money to drink it. I mean, when we went on a beer

01:12.436 --> 01:16.422
bus and they'd have a keg, I'd drink it because it 
was free. Do you remember many times an Aggie being

01:18.524 --> 01:22.810
brought back to the campus pretty well drunk? Did 
that happen very often? Oh, it happened, but not

01:26.515 --> 01:28.358
very often. of laugh about it take him in the shower 
and dump him in there did anybody in your memory get

01:29.587 --> 01:56.725
caught on an inspection having something illegal 
in their room never remember that at all but there

01:29.587 --> 01:56.725
were some people probably that had some some 
alcohol hidden i guess but i don't ever recall it

01:29.587 --> 01:56.725
happening um back to uh to athletics what are some 
of your favorite athletic memories of that era The

01:57.008 --> 02:07.619
first Texas game when Buddy Schaefer, who 
preceded me at Austin High School, played

01:57.008 --> 02:07.619
football here, caught the winning pass in 51 
against Texas. That was Bob Smith's senior year.

02:10.602 --> 02:17.810
Bob got, what's his name, gave him the four-inch 
shiver on the kickoff, Kyle Field, and put him out

02:10.602 --> 02:17.810
for the game. We still won.

02:24.683 --> 02:27.306
We beat Oklahoma that year, I think it was.

02:31.912 --> 02:41.303
When Brian beat Texas, I guess, in Austin and sent 
Ed Price packing, who was the coach over there.

02:41.583 --> 02:47.691
That was in 56, I guess, when I was in graduate 
school. We didn't have, obviously, very good

02:48.572 --> 02:53.037
football teams, but it was always exciting. And 
how were the athletes, as far as you knew, how were

02:55.109 --> 02:59.393
they treated? They weren't treated hardly any 
different. They were over at the companion

03:03.277 --> 03:09.704
building at Hart Hall, which was the same 
structure as Walton. And I, because Dolla Hyde

03:09.724 --> 03:11.866
lived over there. And I went over there, and we had a 
few of them that were married that lived in those

03:13.067 --> 03:23.698
married Quonset hut things down on South Gate, but 
most of them lived there in Hart. As far as you knew,

03:24.083 --> 03:27.367
did they take the same courses that others took? 
Were there any Crip courses just for athletes? I

03:32.374 --> 03:39.983
think they took the same courses, as far as I know, 
that the other students in their discipline took.

03:40.023 --> 03:40.504
That's what I mean. Now, they might have taken 
Ag-Eco, but they took whatever.

03:48.721 --> 03:50.543
Did you by chance know Bobby Drake Keith? We know 
Keith real well. See, he got a double major in

03:53.767 --> 03:59.875
petroleum engineering and geology in four years. 
Gene Stallings got his degree in four years. They

04:03.179 --> 04:09.728
got there about the time Gene was a freshman.

04:11.510 --> 04:18.559
He and Drake were there when Bryant got there, one 
year. That's right. They got out in 57. I think

04:21.180 --> 04:23.322
you're right. So they got there in 53. I believe so. 
In your day, what did the typical Aggie student

04:29.008 --> 04:33.092
think about Yale leaders? Was it a big deal to be a 
Yale leader? I think so, yeah.

04:39.739 --> 04:44.044
I think that was one of the more important 
positions on the campus. I don't think anybody

04:44.384 --> 04:48.428
thought too much about class president or 
anything like that. What was the highest prestige

04:48.965 --> 04:52.269
student position? Corps commander? Yeah, by far. 
Was there even a student body president then? Yes,

04:59.218 --> 05:00.039
there was. Oh, there was? Okay. And class 
president, but that didn't matter much, did it? I

05:07.008 --> 05:09.031
mean, if we had one, I didn't know who he was. Was 
there much attention to student government? You

05:12.716 --> 05:16.761
know, for those that were kind of involved in it, 
I'm sure there was. But the body was the Corps. The

05:21.774 --> 05:25.039
Corps commander was more important than the rest 
of it. And I think there was the first stirrings

05:25.800 --> 05:34.573
maybe of, well there's something more to Texas A&M 
than the Corps. There was some people, I'm trying

05:34.833 --> 05:44.688
to remember the name of that guy in our class who 
was, ended up as editor of the battalion. And he

05:45.729 --> 05:47.592
kind of stirred some things up. That's not at all 
unusual for student editors. Were there any

05:53.654 --> 06:03.313
national or international events during your 
student days that you remember where you were when

05:53.654 --> 06:03.313
you heard the news?

06:06.238 --> 06:07.821
I can't think of any during that time. The first 
thing was after I left. Because like I had just, the

06:12.580 --> 06:27.855
Kennedy assassination, I had just finished an 11 
to 12 o'clock class in Nagel and I went into the

06:12.580 --> 06:27.855
office to get one of my friends and I said, come on, 
let's hurry to the MSC and beat the crowd. I said,

06:27.835 --> 06:29.277
you can listen to the radio later. And he said, 
listen. And the first words I heard were Walter

06:30.680 --> 06:35.889
Cronkite saying, I've just been handed a 
bulletin. President Kennedy is dead. And then for

06:39.094 --> 06:51.295
the folks a little older than you and I, many of them 
when they heard the Pearl Harbor news were at Guyon

06:39.094 --> 06:51.295
Hall for the matinee and they interrupted it. And 
they went running back to their dorm, and all of

06:51.275 --> 06:56.119
them said immediately we knew. They were going. 
They were going. All right, now let's see. When you

06:59.702 --> 07:02.044
were there, Korea was over. Over. I was between the 
two wars, so to speak. We had to go in. And I had, I was

07:09.210 --> 07:12.453
in the Air Force. You had to pass the Air Force 
fiscal. And a lot of my classmates, like George G.

07:15.976 --> 07:20.860
Singh, couldn't pass it, the flight fiscal. So 
that weeded out on the Air Force side. In fact, that

07:24.361 --> 07:32.174
was a big controversy, kind of, because so many of 
them had completed two years at A&M. And then the

07:32.194 --> 07:42.991
Air Force, because they had that terrible surplus 
of pilots that they'd recalled for the Korean War

07:32.194 --> 07:42.991
and didn't want to really bust them out a second 
time. They'd taken them out of a career. So they

07:45.756 --> 07:49.041
ended up with too many people, and they were trying 
to get rid of new people coming in, they had a budget

07:49.443 --> 07:52.226
problem. So the students like George said, look, 
I've completed two years here, now you tell me that

07:54.429 --> 08:03.821
I can't stay here, it's a military school, but I 
can't stay. So I want to transfer to the Army side,

08:05.343 --> 08:09.828
move over to the Army. And the Army had a budget 
problem, and they wouldn't let them move over

08:11.050 --> 08:17.998
there, and that caused some hard feelings. Did you 
Air Force ROTC members think that y'all were a

08:18.333 --> 08:23.959
little smarter than the Army? Did y'all think the 
Air Force a little more? Oh, well, you know, that

08:26.762 --> 08:28.483
went on forever. That's right. You know, why walk 
to where you're going when you can ride? Were there

08:35.310 --> 08:38.594
any competitions? I don't know how we didn't get 
killed. Down in those steam tunnels? How long

08:44.319 --> 08:46.922
before you learned about steam tunnels? Well, 
there weren't steam tunnels until we moved over

08:48.033 --> 08:55.822
that I knew of until we got to what was called the new 
area when I was a sophomore. And, you know, are you

08:55.842 --> 09:01.869
sophomores going to let those guys, those ground 
pounders over there get away with this? So out we'd

09:02.430 --> 09:10.560
go down the steam tunnels, taking the caps off the 
toilets in the middle of the night, putting those

09:02.430 --> 09:10.560
bombs over there. Oh, I mean. How far? As far as you 
know, how far did the steam tunnels extend on the

09:15.556 --> 09:19.823
campus? I don't know. It was always pitch black 
when I was in them, so I never... And in terms of

09:20.485 --> 09:28.458
dimension, the steam tunnel was about how big? Six 
feet, something like that. Six feet wide, maybe

09:34.789 --> 09:37.414
seven feet. And were they bricked or were they 
sealed?

09:44.733 --> 09:45.654
Well, they were sealed. I mean, I guess they were 
bricked. And what lines ran in them? Well, the

09:51.041 --> 09:57.069
steam lines for the radiators in all of our rooms, 
and I assume the telephone and whatever else. I

09:57.350 --> 09:58.952
guess it was a utility tunnel. All the utility. And 
where, say, from your dorm, where was the easiest

10:01.295 --> 10:07.844
place to enter the steam tunnel?

10:11.288 --> 10:11.989
Where did you get in? I think it was out there behind 
the dorm. Over in the new dorm area? Yeah. And

10:18.523 --> 10:20.165
wasn't it locked? No. There was a ladder going down 
there. Okay. You know, it's amazing what you

10:26.574 --> 10:30.699
forget.

10:31.039 --> 10:32.601
Then you go, you knew how to get there. Somebody 
showed you how to get over to the other side. Then

10:37.708 --> 10:38.449
you come out. Because I think they ran literally 
almost all over the campus. I'm sure they did,

10:41.769 --> 11:00.832
because when you mention that, I remember the 
steam tunnel that was between the old Y and the new,

10:41.769 --> 11:00.832
they built a brand new administration building 
where Harrington moved into, there across from

10:41.769 --> 11:00.832
the drill field, that little street.

11:02.994 --> 11:06.358
Now, do you remember anybody ever getting hurt in 
the steam tunnel? Fallen. missing the ladder and

11:07.387 --> 11:11.131
going whomp in the bottom, breaking their arm. 
Now, you did carry a flashlight, didn't you? Oh,

11:13.154 --> 11:13.354
yeah. Okay. Okay.

11:17.319 --> 11:27.491
I mean...

11:17.319 --> 11:27.491
One of my classmates in electrical engineering 
was Joe Bickley, who graduated from El Paso High.

11:27.631 --> 11:31.415
The Bickleys were big cotton farmers up in Canyon 
Tia. And that first, very first day, we were

11:32.476 --> 11:37.242
sitting in that class, and I think it was... he 
wasn't a Dr. Rose, Norman Rose, I think, right? Had

11:45.034 --> 11:47.357
each one of us tell where we were from. And when he 
got to Joe, Joe didn't say El Paso, of course,

11:47.397 --> 11:52.724
Canyon T was up. He says, oh, I know what it was. He 
didn't ask us to say it. He had the list of us and

11:57.210 --> 11:59.253
where we were from. And he gets to Joe and he says, 
Mr. Bickley from Canoodle, Texas, And Joe and I

12:06.449 --> 12:13.739
look at each other, of course, those days you 
didn't laugh or anything, and he says, sir, he

12:06.449 --> 12:13.739
says, that's Cañatillo.

12:15.942 --> 12:16.783
Cañatillo. Oh, okay. So a little later, somebody 
asked, it wasn't Rose, but somebody said, y'all

12:19.667 --> 12:27.579
still have Indians out there? Joe and I looked at 
each other and said, man, we haven't gone east, but

12:29.421 --> 12:34.929
they sure haven't gone west. Mm-hmm. At

12:35.491 --> 12:52.169
A&M, in that era, what was the, what were the events 
or traditions or whatever that pulled everybody

12:35.491 --> 12:52.169
together so well? Well, I think it was, as I say, the 
core and everything that it embodied, from let's

12:53.370 --> 13:03.000
call it the metal hazing, from the strict regimen 
that was imposed from 6 a.m. in the morning to

13:04.111 --> 13:12.101
whatever it was, we all endured it.

13:15.105 --> 13:19.291
I thought about this a lot in relation to what I've 
done subsequently. I think A&M turns out some of

13:20.412 --> 13:24.197
the best people in the world because of that 
regimen. In many respects, we're very pragmatic,

13:24.998 --> 13:29.204
but we never quit. That's one thing, we never, ever 
quit.

13:34.537 --> 13:40.745
We may not turn out as many artists or people of that 
type. What we do is, that's why so many presidents

13:42.127 --> 13:48.496
of oil companies, they're pragmatic, they're 
hardworking.

13:52.161 --> 13:58.890
I don't guess we've turned out a lot of 
politicians, Perry and Sharp, but for the most

13:52.161 --> 13:58.890
part,

14:01.672 --> 14:10.965
As a politician, I think we had a very, very good 
ethical.

14:10.985 --> 14:14.470
You didn't lie, you didn't steal, and you didn't 
cheat, period. And you went home if you did. And

14:16.793 --> 14:19.296
that was ingrained. What were the events that 
contributed most to, at A&M, that contributed

14:21.279 --> 14:28.309
most to those attitudes? Well, as I say, the Corps. 
But what else? I think the fact that A&M was

14:31.591 --> 14:49.588
isolated had a lot to do with it because we didn't 
get exposure to a lot of things that other students

14:31.591 --> 14:49.588
got exposed to, good or bad, it molded our 
character.

14:50.569 --> 14:54.813
I think the faculty had a lot to do with it. I think we 
had a very conservative faculty. But things like

14:59.705 --> 15:03.831
Yale practice and games.

15:06.435 --> 15:10.121
Yale practice, final review, core trips. You took 
care of each other. Silver taps? Silver taps. Do

15:17.352 --> 15:19.174
you remember when you first went to a silver tap? My 
freshman year. Hadn't been there probably in

15:20.797 --> 15:24.703
October until somebody got killed in an 
automobile accident. What was your feeling? I

15:28.797 --> 15:31.600
didn't know at that time whoever it was. And in 
fact, it wasn't a freshman. It was somebody else, I

15:33.042 --> 15:34.564
recall. But it was a tremendously moving 
experience. I had never been involved in anything

15:38.769 --> 15:42.193
like that. Did everybody take it seriously? Oh, 
yes. And I think as a freshman, if I recall, I said,

15:46.218 --> 15:57.471
in the middle of the night, I'm getting drug out to 
go to this thing in the world. And then after that

15:58.548 --> 16:02.273
you realized that was part of this bonding. And a 
lot of people don't understand that. And I

16:05.937 --> 16:07.018
understand that too. Final review. I thought the 
Ross Volunteers did a lot of that. I thought that

16:13.606 --> 16:18.993
building the bonfire did a lot of that.

16:22.537 --> 16:26.462
Just having to march to every meal did a lot of that. 
So

16:26.915 --> 16:34.903
after your sophomore year, you came back home, 
worked. What about after, when did you go to summer

16:35.464 --> 16:38.547
camp the first time? Well, we went between our 
junior and senior years. So at the end of my junior

16:41.871 --> 16:45.975
year, I went out to summer camp. Where? March Air 
Force Base. Joe Walker, who was head of Centex, was

16:49.439 --> 16:55.285
in my class. He and Dale Fisher, I don't know where 
Dale is, but Joe and I stay in contact. And the three

17:02.799 --> 17:08.807
of us, Joe picked up one of these cars where you 
drive. In those days they may still do it. They want

17:11.730 --> 17:13.533
a car moved from here to there. And he got one in 
Dallas, came out here and picked Dale and I up and we

17:13.833 --> 17:19.741
went this March. And how did you Aggies, how did 
summer, that summer camp go? and we had a blast. Did

17:27.912 --> 17:29.414
you all think you were well prepared? Oh yeah, 
yeah. Did any of the others look with any kind of

17:32.517 --> 17:39.366
special way upon you Aggies? I think they kind of 
said, you know, you're taking this military a

17:40.887 --> 17:45.713
little too far. And did that summer camp 
experience have any effect on you the next year?

17:54.361 --> 17:56.965
Well, then I came back home and got married. Okay. 
But I always thought the summer camp was a great

17:59.068 --> 18:01.732
experience. And it helped me, I thought, the three 
years that I was in the Air Force. Right, so then you

18:07.480 --> 18:10.525
and your wife moved to Bryan College Station. We 
moved. And where did you find a place to live? Well,

18:13.148 --> 18:20.739
old man Lauderstein had a terrible, rickety, old 
two-story house that he converted into four

18:13.148 --> 18:20.739
apartments there at Northgate. It's been torn 
down. It's about two blocks. Remember what the

18:23.521 --> 18:24.563
rent was? I think it was $30 a month. And what kind of 
furniture did y'all take? This was furnished. It

18:32.315 --> 18:34.198
was the worst stuff you ever seen. And I had a deal 
with him that he had three or four right there. And I

18:40.027 --> 18:42.090
had a deal that I'd keep them repaired. And he paid 
me 50 cents an hour. And they all set up on whatever.

18:51.770 --> 18:52.831
And we had a freeze. And the pipes froze and broke. 
And I'm in there that afternoon, right at

18:56.554 --> 19:04.582
freezing, mud on my back, putting in new sections 
of pipe. But then the next year, while I was in

19:06.123 --> 19:12.649
graduate school, as I said, Chris Gronemann built 
those new little duplexes. They're kind of

19:12.669 --> 19:14.230
dog-eared now. I saw them a couple of months ago, 
but we moved over there. And your wife got a job with

19:17.413 --> 19:19.195
Brian? She originally, that was the first year of 
Gilmer Aiken. And she originally couldn't get a

19:24.858 --> 19:28.221
job. They didn't have any openings in Bryan. So she 
got a job teaching in Snook. And when we arrived

19:34.806 --> 19:47.137
about the 20th of August,

19:34.806 --> 19:47.137
they had sent a letter out to El Paso from Bryan 
saying, we've got an opening. So we got the letter.

19:49.246 --> 19:53.090
And she called SNCC and said, I'm not coming, and 
went to work with Brian. And do you remember what

19:54.151 --> 19:55.552
her pay was? Well, Gilmore-Aitken was $2,815 a 
year. And I had a fellowship

20:00.777 --> 20:17.734
in graduate school over with the

20:00.777 --> 20:17.734
calculator lab, the thing that we did the utility 
studies for all the utilities up there. What's his

20:18.153 --> 20:19.615
name? What was the professor that ran that? He 
talked. Anyway, and so I had a fellowship, and we

20:26.767 --> 20:33.198
did load studies for all the utilities. I got to 
know all of them in those days. Before we quit,

20:36.103 --> 20:39.389
let's go back for you as a senior. When did you get 
your senior ring? You know, I don't wear either one

20:45.170 --> 20:50.318
because I played golf, and they started cutting my 
hands. So about 20 years ago, I had to take them off,

20:50.338 --> 20:54.344
and I tried to give mine to my son. But anyway, I got 
it.

21:03.097 --> 21:06.322
You know, was it somewhere around Christmas 
maybe? And how much did it cost, do you remember?

21:10.588 --> 21:11.329
Where'd you get the money?

21:15.055 --> 21:19.702
Well, you had to pay for it, I think, what, in May 
before you left school? I think that's right. Your

21:21.245 --> 21:24.831
junior

21:21.245 --> 21:24.831
year. And was it, was it 50 bucks? Something like 
that. I think that's what it was. How did you feel

21:30.500 --> 21:32.463
when you put it on? Oh, I thought it was, I mean, I 
made it. And I had saved the money. I guess I, when I

21:37.691 --> 21:40.716
worked, I'd saved the money. I'd paid for it. You 
know, those things, I don't know, they've got to be

21:42.730 --> 21:44.872
worth a fortune. I've got it in the lockbox. Do you 
have any ring stories where something unusual

21:47.015 --> 21:53.763
happened or somebody saw it or you lost it? I never 
lost it, but people would see it, especially if you

21:53.943 --> 22:03.174
were a couple times in New York City or in the Air 
Force. Of course, there's a lot of Aggies, of

22:04.916 --> 22:09.861
course, who were in the military in those days. 
Then you bought your senior boots? I never had

22:12.093 --> 22:16.857
senior boots.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.002
Of course, I was married, and I went in the day 
ducks. Oh, so you didn't have to have senior boots.

22:24.784 --> 22:31.169
Well, yeah, a lot of them did, but being married, 
and that was big money, I just didn't have any. So

22:31.189 --> 22:34.372
you didn't go through final review your fourth 
year? Oh, I did. Oh, you did? It was a day duck. Oh, it

22:36.474 --> 22:37.595
was a day duck, okay. How did you feel at final 
review and commencement? I don't remember much

22:43.193 --> 22:45.875
about final review at that point. Obviously, of 
course, being married, I said I made it. I've done

22:54.303 --> 22:56.164
what I set out to do. And I think that was a 
tremendous sense of accomplishment. And I'll

23:01.929 --> 23:03.751
tell you this. That day is the day you feel like you 
owe Texas A&M a tremendous debt of gratitude. Why?

23:13.670 --> 23:43.002
uh just because because you know there's a lot of 
people that had opportunity that didn't accept

23:13.670 --> 23:43.002
take it of course i knew i was going on to graduate 
school which made it a little different it wasn't

23:13.670 --> 23:43.002
like a final closure at that point do you remember 
who the commencement speaker was no i don't almost

23:13.670 --> 23:43.002
none of us do but what feeling did you have i 
remember my graduate school graduation more than

23:13.670 --> 23:43.002
i remember my when you got that diploma? I remember 
Harrington handing it to me. And was it special to

23:50.514 --> 23:55.680
have your name called and your loved ones there? 
That's right. Let's quit at that point. See, I

23:59.845 --> 24:04.050
think that's one of the very essential things that 
they must, must, must continue. Yes, now they're

24:04.471 --> 24:12.060
having four commencements because there's so 
many names, but they're still calling every name

24:04.471 --> 24:12.060
and still shaking every hand.

24:14.048 --> 24:16.652
that stage, and they look absolutely wonderful. I 
guess, if you could see their face. Sure. Through

24:20.759 --> 24:22.241
the annuals, there was pictures. Oh. Sammy Kay, 
Tex Spinnicky, Ray Anthony, a bunch of them. Oh,

24:29.313 --> 24:30.174
that's good. Now, did you go to many of those 
dances? No, I don't remember. I never had the

24:34.501 --> 24:35.803
money. I don't think I went to a dance. For spending 
money, once you settled in, what did you do for

24:39.877 --> 24:44.506
money? Well, I got $5 a week. I had to buy haircuts, 
pay for any excess laundry, whatever. But then I

24:52.161 --> 24:55.508
tried to work. Where? Well, because I was taking so 
many hours, I couldn't take, so I had to be a little,

24:56.641 --> 25:04.934
I sold Reader's Digest subscriptions. I put up TV 
antennas, I told you about that. I worked for old

25:10.703 --> 25:14.869
man Lauterstein repairing his apartments. 
things that i could set my own hours and uh you went

25:15.423 --> 25:41.363
up to to denton about how often to visit that 
special young lady well about once a month you

25:15.423 --> 25:41.363
could go up there i could go i'm just amazed that i 
got thinking about that for a dollar or two i'd i'd

25:15.423 --> 25:41.363
hitchhike when you got up there they had an old 
clapboard house on campus with bunk bear cots in it

25:15.423 --> 25:41.363
for the aggies You could stay there for, you got a 
towel and a bar of soap for 25 cents a night. I could

25:47.986 --> 26:06.336
eat over in their dining hall, and then I, or we'd go 
out, she had put up half the money, my wife did, and

25:47.986 --> 26:06.336
we'd go to some, you know, fast food, whatever, the 
pig stand or whatever it was, and then you'd

25:47.986 --> 26:06.336
hitchhike back home. Did you go to a dance up there 
quite often? No, I may have gone to one up there.

26:14.867 --> 26:18.412
Were there many Aggie-Tessie couples? Yeah, lots 
of them. The place was swarming with Aggies on the

26:20.014 --> 26:22.357
weekend. And then when they came down to the 
campus. They came on either the train or the bus.

26:29.146 --> 26:30.688
They chartered a lot of buses. And at the dances, 
how were all the young ladies treated at Aggie

26:32.339 --> 26:38.427
dances? Oh, I think they were just treated 
magnificently. I think Aggies treated their

26:40.970 --> 26:47.339
dates quite well. I don't think they spent a lot of 
money on them. And at A&M dances, was there heavy

26:51.524 --> 26:55.069
drinking? Well, I don't think so, but I was never 
there. I've not heard of any. I don't think so. I

27:01.259 --> 27:05.887
don't think anybody ever thought about doing 
something like that. In your student era, did

27:06.067 --> 27:09.432
Aggies smoke? Mm-hmm. And what were they smoking? 
Oh, I'm sure what everybody else, I guess, I didn't

27:13.279 --> 27:17.245
smoke.

27:20.069 --> 27:24.216
But I'm sure they, Lucky Strikes and Camels and Old 
Gold and whatever. Were cigars at all? I think, no,

27:28.355 --> 27:31.439
not as a practice. I think some guys would get a 
cigar and smoke it, but I don't think anybody that I

27:31.520 --> 27:37.368
knew could ever afford to buy a cigar. Did you and 
your buddies even know the words related to drugs?

27:43.516 --> 27:45.799
No, never heard of them. And see, today's 
youngsters can't believe that. Well, I don't

27:49.034 --> 27:51.797
think anybody. Maybe there were somewhere else, 
maybe in big cities, but I mean, we never heard the

27:51.837 --> 27:59.405
word marijuana. Did Aggies play cards sometimes, 
poker? They played poker and moon. Sometimes for

28:07.693 --> 28:08.574
money. Yeah, a little, but I never saw any, very, 
very rarely. Now, for you, how was it different to

28:13.910 --> 28:19.458
be a sophomore than it was to be a freshman? Well, 
besides having the pressure of somebody on you all

28:21.181 --> 28:39.327
the time and having all the extracurricular stuff 
that they made you do, which made you relax a little

28:21.181 --> 28:39.327
more, you also realized, well, you were going to be 
there unless you flunked out for the duration. And

28:40.370 --> 28:50.926
therefore, you were more at home with the 
university and the life of the university, which

28:40.370 --> 28:50.926
meant that you functioned better. Now, you were in 
the same outfit as the sophomore? Well, we had

28:55.193 --> 28:57.056
freshman outfits. Oh, that's right. And then you 
went to the new area, and it was squadron 14. What

29:04.367 --> 29:07.952
was different about eating in Duncan compared to 
Sevesa? The food was the same. Not much, other than

29:10.019 --> 29:17.712
you weren't a freshman.

29:17.992 --> 29:22.640
Do you remember some good dining hall pranks or 
jokes? Well,

29:23.361 --> 29:29.290
I can't remember. The only thing I can remember is 
stealing the pie.

29:38.133 --> 29:42.381
You know, you didn't get cush when you were a 
freshman. And I forget who it was, just went by the

29:42.401 --> 29:55.967
table

29:42.401 --> 29:55.967
and stole, there was always, you got two pies, I 
think it was, and took one of them. I mean, you know,

29:57.069 --> 30:00.175
the upperclassmen just went crazy. Oh you know the 
old the old stuff about you had to get up on sit on the

30:01.049 --> 30:10.240
back of your chair and the air raid drill and that 
kind of stuff but that had gone on for years. Other

30:12.763 --> 30:14.505
than that I don't remember a lot about it. Now did 
you were you ever subjected to cush questions? Oh

30:19.331 --> 30:20.813
yeah yeah. Now as a sophomore did you ever use the 
paddle on anybody? I as I told you I had never other

30:26.520 --> 30:29.824
than when I was in the RVs nor did I ever use it. RVs. 
We may have done this the other day, but I want to be

30:36.562 --> 30:38.465
sure. Did you apply? No, no. We went through that. I 
don't know how. I don't know what the process,

30:45.094 --> 30:47.458
selection process was. One day they called me over 
to some kind of meeting and said, you've been

30:47.558 --> 30:57.212
selected to be a member of the RVs. Did you all have 
to buy your uniforms, or were they provided? No, I

31:00.407 --> 31:01.891
think we bought our uniforms. And how proud did you 
feel when you put it on? Oh, I thought that was the

31:05.278 --> 31:06.941
greatest thing in the world. And what were some of 
the ceremonies? You remember RVs.
