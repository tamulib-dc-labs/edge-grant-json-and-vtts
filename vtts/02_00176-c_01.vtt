00:02.444 --> 00:12.938
Transition from Dr. Miller to Dr. Sampson, correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Sampson was president about a year, interim president.

00:13.059 --> 00:14.020
About a year and a half.

00:14.200 --> 00:14.721
A year and a half.

00:15.642 --> 00:26.477
And were there any major changes in the way the university was governed, led, administered during that time?

00:26.457 --> 00:28.841
No, let me revise.

00:28.941 --> 00:32.567
I think it was just a little over a year to correct what I said.

00:33.027 --> 00:41.280
No, there was a certain feeling of tentativeness about the situation because it wasn't known if he was going to be the permanent president.

00:41.300 --> 00:49.834
Then it was announced that there was a search committee appointed and that the search committee was large enough to do close order drill.

00:49.914 --> 00:53.680
I mean, there were two dozen people or something like that on it.

00:54.267 --> 01:07.185
And then it became dubious that Dr. Sampson was going to be because of the variety of interests represented on that committee.

01:08.567 --> 01:13.153
But there wasn't any big change in the way the university operated, no.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.505
Then Dr. Vandiver was selected.

01:16.046 --> 01:16.286
Right.

01:16.507 --> 01:19.033
And I think began in the fall of 81.

01:19.754 --> 01:20.235
Fall of 81.

01:20.997 --> 01:24.966
How did you first interact with him?

01:25.047 --> 01:27.029
It was all very pleasant.

01:27.049 --> 01:33.215
I had announced about July of 81 that I was leaving the vice presidency and was going back to research.

01:34.076 --> 01:42.444
And I was going to take half a year or a year and go to Harvard Medical School and do research there.

01:42.624 --> 01:47.449
And so my departure had already been announced.

01:47.469 --> 01:54.396
But he contacted me, very affable, very friendly.

01:55.557 --> 02:23.708
uh... he wanted me to stay on and in fact one time he wanted me to consider coming back as executive vice president and i said no we'll cross that bridge when we come to it but had no intention of doing any such thing uh... my laboratory was in great shape thanks to ms wilkes and ms bayless and um... and dr john baker who was a postdoc with us for a while and so i was eager to get back

02:24.278 --> 02:25.499
to the battlefront.

02:26.180 --> 02:31.367
And Dr. Vandiver and I had very good relations, very good.

02:31.387 --> 02:33.549
So you left the Vice Presidency when?

02:33.569 --> 02:34.631
January of 1982.

02:34.671 --> 02:40.178
I resigned effectively the last day of December of 81.

02:40.358 --> 02:42.400
So I was here one semester.

02:42.420 --> 02:49.849
In fact, I called Dr. Hubert and I said, I had planned to leave here on September 1st to go to Boston.

02:49.889 --> 02:50.370
I said,

02:50.738 --> 02:56.246
Would you like me to stay one semester and help Dr. Vandiver get settled?

02:56.266 --> 02:59.430
He said, I would deem that to be appropriate if you will do it.

02:59.590 --> 03:00.351
So I said, fine.

03:01.172 --> 03:03.656
I moved to Boston when it was snowing.

03:06.199 --> 03:08.543
We got there, it was all clear, and it began to snow.

03:08.603 --> 03:13.049
As soon as we went to the store to get our first provisions, then the snow began to fall right then.

03:13.409 --> 03:18.957
But anyhow, Dr. Vandiver and I had very friendly relations.

03:19.240 --> 03:36.499
All right, look back on all those years, whether you were a research faculty member only, a dean or vice president, what accomplishments give you most pride?

03:38.722 --> 03:39.383
Oh, I don't know.

03:39.403 --> 03:40.404
It's a hard thing to say.

03:40.524 --> 03:45.990
I think that probably my happiest days were when I was dean.

03:47.202 --> 03:51.594
just overall, because my research program still ran pretty well.

03:52.798 --> 03:57.972
And I was able to do some things I wanted to do for the College of Science.

03:58.289 --> 04:11.148
And as I said to a previous question, I think that one of the things was the advancement of research and the broad sweep of things and the faculty recruitment.

04:11.229 --> 04:20.142
And also I think the point you mentioned when we were just chatting a few minutes ago about the student's feeling of closeness to the university.

04:20.162 --> 04:25.410
And I don't know if I had much to do with that, but I certainly tried to encourage it.

04:27.128 --> 04:42.848
So, in hindsight, can you think of anything now you wish that you could have helped accomplish that didn't come about?

04:43.629 --> 04:52.661
Oh, yes, there are probably a number of them, but none comes to mind right now.

04:53.502 --> 04:53.742
All right.

04:54.704 --> 04:56.646
Again, blessed with hindsight.

04:56.997 --> 05:07.995
If you had omnipotence and omniscience, how would you have Texas A&M and the Texas A&M system organized?

05:10.399 --> 05:14.365
Well, if I were omnipotent,

05:14.969 --> 05:32.826
Joel Hildebrand the famous chemist at Berkeley who also taught freshman chemistry was in a was in a confrontation regarding education a few years ago and some professor of education wrote a screed and said something about Hildebrand claimed to be omnipotent and

05:33.312 --> 05:35.735
And Hill ran a road back and said, he means omniscient.

05:35.755 --> 05:38.139
He said, if I were omnipotent, he wouldn't be a professor.

05:40.041 --> 05:43.406
If I were omnipotent, there wouldn't be a system of the Texas A&M University.

05:43.826 --> 05:49.174
The university would stand alone with its own board of regents, would deal directly with the legislature on that basis.

05:49.234 --> 05:52.038
That would be, I think, a great step forward.

05:52.178 --> 05:54.942
Where would the services and stations report?

05:58.687 --> 05:59.488
Somewhere else.

06:00.464 --> 06:08.696
I think that they could be integrated into the system to report to the university and not to the system.

06:08.756 --> 06:16.768
Would they report to the president or to the chief academic officer or the dean?

06:18.271 --> 06:22.717
That's the trickiest question that we've had to deal with all along, and there's no good answer to it.

06:23.578 --> 06:29.307
I think it would have to come up through the dean, but this gives you then two superdeans.

06:29.759 --> 06:31.361
And that's not good either.

06:31.441 --> 06:34.626
So there's no good solution to that problem.

06:34.646 --> 06:37.610
But it's certainly no solution to have them go through the system.

06:37.810 --> 06:58.500
I've always wondered why shouldn't it be appropriate that a faculty member in any department could submit a research proposal to the experiment stations and have a fair chance of getting it funded

07:00.067 --> 07:01.909
or I'll put it on a contract basis.

07:02.169 --> 07:03.991
I'd be totally in favor of that.

07:04.331 --> 07:07.255
It seems like to me that would strengthen everything.

07:07.275 --> 07:09.737
Absolutely, I would be totally in favor of that.

07:09.757 --> 07:12.981
In other words, somebody in physics submits one to the engineering station.

07:13.441 --> 07:16.404
It's judged on its merits and either funded or not.

07:16.424 --> 07:19.567
Somebody in biology sends one to the agricultural experiment station.

07:19.668 --> 07:21.710
I'm very much in favor of that system.

07:21.730 --> 07:26.154
Somebody in history wants to write a history of the Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association.

07:26.174 --> 07:26.355
Fine.

07:26.915 --> 07:28.817
And they decide whether it's worth doing or not?

07:29.037 --> 07:29.618
Okay.

07:29.598 --> 07:33.123
But I don't know any, I don't know whether that's done anywhere.

07:33.143 --> 07:35.907
I don't know of a single institution where that's done.

07:36.548 --> 07:46.902
And as far as I know, this same kind of flagship and system problem exists in a number of places.

07:48.103 --> 07:48.504
Let's see.

07:48.724 --> 07:49.225
All right.

07:49.846 --> 07:52.990
If you could have them all back in person.

07:54.117 --> 08:00.608
Who would you like to thank for their assistance to you?

08:02.271 --> 08:02.852
Oh, gosh.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.037
We're going to run out of tape here.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.948
Well, I'm going to put Ms.

08:12.988 --> 08:13.449
Wilkes and Ms.

08:13.489 --> 08:16.935
Bayless right up at the top because they saved my career.

08:17.708 --> 08:21.075
Dr. Williams, for whom I have high regard.

08:21.135 --> 08:25.564
As a matter of fact, I've saved a lot of notes that he wrote me over the years.

08:25.604 --> 08:31.836
I've got a scrapbook and I've got a bunch of things that he sent me.

08:32.407 --> 08:49.875
uh... doc calhoun and by the way i do thank him from time to time when i see him uh... mr rudder i would certainly put in that category john beckham who was my associate dean for a long time now this is now deceased uh... the uh... many of the beans with whom i served uh...

08:50.564 --> 09:03.120
The people back in my department, Dr. Lyman, Dr. Couch, Howard Vestal, by all means, John Colas.

09:03.180 --> 09:10.929
I'm going to omit too many people because I hadn't thought about this, but scores of people.

09:11.830 --> 09:17.297
That's been the great pleasure of it is the people that I've dealt with.

09:18.931 --> 09:24.418
And I feel like an old line rancher that we knew in West Texas.

09:26.020 --> 09:31.988
He had moved his herd from Del Rio to take up a new ranch at Van Horn.

09:32.008 --> 09:38.015
He got to Alpine, and he got a telegram that there's no water left in the tank, which is the only water.

09:38.416 --> 09:44.664
He said, the people around Alpine took me in, went in our herd, the rains came, we moved on.

09:44.744 --> 09:48.128
He said, doctor, all my life,

09:48.665 --> 09:52.531
It's been my good fortune to associate with high-class people.

09:52.551 --> 09:53.452
Oh, that's good.

09:53.472 --> 09:54.013
That's good.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.256
Okay, next to last question.

09:57.297 --> 10:01.764
Somebody hands you a million-dollar check, and there's only one condition.

10:02.405 --> 10:08.974
You must give it to Texas A&M, but you get to decide what it's to be spent for.

10:11.838 --> 10:18.047
Okay, I'd spend about $900,000 on a lawyer to show me how to sew it up where the regents couldn't do anything with it.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.201
That's good.

10:21.842 --> 10:22.463
That's good.

10:24.266 --> 10:26.449
What would you do with the rest?

10:26.569 --> 10:31.416
I would probably establish a chair.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.780
Are they going for more than a million now?

10:33.800 --> 10:34.260
I don't know.

10:34.280 --> 10:49.182
Anyhow, I would probably establish a chair or put it in the discretionary fund for, oh, let's say the vice president for academic affairs.

10:50.832 --> 10:56.380
I was really pleased that Mr. Bright gave $25 million and just put it under the President's direction to do.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.104
I thought that was very foresighted.

10:59.124 --> 11:04.952
But I'd say that either flexible money or a chair would be what I would do.

11:06.354 --> 11:06.454
Okay.

11:06.474 --> 11:07.195
Last question.

11:08.076 --> 11:14.545
As you look back, what did it mean to your life to have these years associated with Texas A&M?

11:16.668 --> 11:20.441
Well, it's been a very pleasant life.

11:20.622 --> 11:22.910
There was never a day when I'd be going to work.

11:24.455 --> 11:29.412
Always look forward to it.
