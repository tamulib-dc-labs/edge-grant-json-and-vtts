You were about to tell me about the Presbyterian 
Church at Northgate. Yes. The land was given by my

00:09.200 --> 00:12.464
father and Frank Anderson. They gave the land. The 
church, the first one, was brought from Victoria

00:13.766 --> 00:18.412
after World War II. They brought an old church from 
the military church and put there, and then it was

00:18.752 --> 00:26.823
built on from there. How long had your father owned 
that land? Oh, he didn't own it. They bought it to

00:32.676 --> 00:33.958
give to the church. Oh, they bought it. They bought 
it for the church. Who'd they buy it from, do you

00:36.061 --> 00:37.523
know? Was it the Boyettes? I think Boyette, I 
guess. Have any idea what they paid for it? No. But

00:44.613 --> 00:47.117
couldn't bid a lot because he didn't have that 
much. All right. Was there a Presbyterian

00:48.459 --> 00:53.426
congregation in existence before that church? 
Yes. We went to church in the YMCA. And...

01:02.384 --> 01:17.143
I know we went and the Episcopalians went in the 
YMCA, but because Frank, my little brother, he

01:02.384 --> 01:17.143
always sat outside and read the funny papers while 
we were in the church. About how big was the

01:18.825 --> 01:22.950
congregation when that new building got here? I 
don't have any idea. Who was the first minister?

01:30.025 --> 01:33.109
I guess Mr. Anderson, I don't know. He was there so 
long, but I'm not sure that he was. Who were some of

01:38.037 --> 01:45.748
the other families other than the Boltons and 
the... The Adrenses and the...

01:46.108 --> 01:55.822
Well, I just don't know. I can't think of who that 
was from. There were quite a few, though. Quite a

02:01.716 --> 02:02.563
few.
