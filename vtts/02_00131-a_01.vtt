00:02.765 --> 00:09.316
Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4, testing April, no, May 1.

00:13.643 --> 00:18.771
Testing some more, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1 on May 1.

00:19.152 --> 00:25.042
Test it, 1, 2, 3, 4, testing, testing, 1, 2, 3.

00:25.062 --> 00:28.347
Okay, you want me to say the same thing or is this all right?

00:28.447 --> 00:29.008
That's enough.

00:30.642 --> 00:40.636
This is May the first and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Forrest Lane, the president of the student body or student association?

00:40.737 --> 00:42.279
That's correct, student body.

00:42.299 --> 00:47.727
Student body of Texas A&M for the academic year 2000 and 2001.

00:47.787 --> 00:57.561
Forrest, to describe yourself, to introduce yourself to anybody who might listen to this tape or read the transcription,

00:58.773 --> 01:00.755
Tell about yourself before you got here.

01:00.835 --> 01:01.576
Where'd you grow up?

01:01.636 --> 01:02.977
What did mom and dad do?

01:03.037 --> 01:04.178
Where'd you go to high school?

01:05.039 --> 01:05.800
Introduce yourself.

01:07.421 --> 01:07.621
Okay.

01:07.841 --> 01:09.963
I'm from, originally from San Antonio, Texas.

01:10.744 --> 01:16.209
I moved there in, I guess probably right about the start of high school.

01:16.229 --> 01:17.851
So before then I lived in Oklahoma.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.533
So not a native Texan, so to speak.

01:21.474 --> 01:25.658
And I have four brothers and sisters, so a total of five.

01:26.110 --> 01:31.537
And nobody in my family has really gone to college like right out of high school.

01:31.677 --> 01:41.349
Certainly my mom and my grandfather went in their 30s at night school and stuff like that in order to accomplish their degree.

01:41.430 --> 01:46.476
But never anyone that's gone through A&M or gone through a full university like that.

01:46.556 --> 01:48.519
So kind of a new experience for me.

01:48.959 --> 01:49.600
Which high school?

01:50.181 --> 01:51.542
I went to Churchill in San Antonio.

01:51.562 --> 01:51.983
Churchill.

01:52.317 --> 01:53.638
How many in that senior class?

01:54.199 --> 01:56.281
Oh, probably something around 700, 650, 700.

01:57.482 --> 01:58.744
And where were you in your class?

01:59.785 --> 02:00.826
Top 25 percent.

02:00.866 --> 02:03.548
I don't know where in that top 25 percent, but somewhere.

02:03.568 --> 02:05.731
All right, one of the very important questions.

02:05.811 --> 02:07.052
Why did you attend A&M?

02:07.112 --> 02:08.493
Why here instead of some other place?

02:10.475 --> 02:11.076
Oh, I don't know.

02:11.096 --> 02:17.903
I think it really was one of those foolish reasons to stay here for a girlfriend that was going to be close in town.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.396
So I decided to come here.

02:20.436 --> 02:25.367
A friend said, hey, let's go to A&M, and it'll be a good time, and let's join the Corps.

02:25.387 --> 02:29.836
And I didn't know anything about it, so I said, okay, sounds like fun, and did that.

02:29.956 --> 02:35.508
Although, of course, she dumped me about three months later, so I don't know how worthwhile it was, but I've enjoyed it since.

02:35.548 --> 02:36.270
It was a good mistake.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.537
Did you come to visit before coming to enroll?

02:40.293 --> 02:42.855
I showed up on registration, but not before then.

02:43.596 --> 02:44.557
Did you go to fish camp?

02:44.917 --> 02:46.018
Yes.

02:46.038 --> 02:46.719
How important?

02:46.779 --> 02:49.081
What was fish camp for you?

02:49.982 --> 02:55.286
Well, first time I'd ever seen any of these crazy wildcatting things and Aggie traditions.

02:55.326 --> 02:59.750
So I think for me it was a good time for me to understand what the world was going on at this place.

02:59.810 --> 03:02.273
I didn't have any clue, and it was good.

03:02.353 --> 03:09.439
The energy and atmosphere was there, and I think it certainly made it a lot less scary of a place to come when you're starting out.

03:09.622 --> 03:12.747
Did it help to build friendship and bonding?

03:13.429 --> 03:14.050
Oh, absolutely.

03:14.190 --> 03:16.634
I mean, some of those friendships change over the years.

03:16.714 --> 03:19.079
Some people you stay in touch with and some people you don't.

03:19.159 --> 03:26.852
But, you know, nonetheless, at least the first couple of weeks, months, whatever it may be, at least you have somebody you know and somebody you can stay in touch with.

03:27.894 --> 03:30.759
When you came to enroll, how did you get here?

03:30.979 --> 03:34.245
What did you bring with you in terms of gear and stuff?

03:34.580 --> 03:36.042
Enrolling or when I actually showed up?

03:36.283 --> 03:37.525
When you actually showed up?

03:37.545 --> 03:44.876
When I actually showed up, I had a cardboard box, one of those moving boxes, probably about three feet tall, and that's all I had, the back seat of a truck.

03:44.896 --> 03:55.713
So some clothes, some t-shirts, and didn't need much since I was going in the Corps, and just lights, some general things, nothing really, nothing very much at all.

03:55.753 --> 03:57.195
In fact, sometimes I wonder,

03:57.175 --> 04:02.455
how I started with so much and now I have so much to move I can't get it out of here, but it was fun.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.860
And that was the fall of?

04:04.081 --> 04:04.623
Fall of 96.

04:04.663 --> 04:04.924
96.

04:06.470 --> 04:08.417
And what kind of truck did you come in?

04:09.055 --> 04:13.883
Well, I came in my grandfather's Cadillac, so it was a... It wasn't a truck.

04:13.983 --> 04:17.610
No, it sure wasn't, but it was... Was it yours to use after you got here?

04:17.970 --> 04:18.491
No.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.974
I didn't have a car when I came here.

04:20.034 --> 04:21.857
Didn't get a car until my sophomore year.

04:22.558 --> 04:27.767
Do you remember what that first year's registration cost?

04:29.951 --> 04:30.412
I'm not sure.

04:31.434 --> 04:32.295
Probably...

04:33.237 --> 04:37.803
Tuition's not very expensive, I would say, compared to other universities.

04:38.503 --> 04:46.934
It's probably somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500, depending on the number of semester or number of credit hours you're registering for.

04:47.515 --> 04:51.119
Most expensive is probably the fees and the living expenses.

04:51.159 --> 04:54.043
And since I lived on campus, all that was under one bill.

04:54.643 --> 04:57.447
And so that was definitely much more expensive than the actual tuition.

04:57.747 --> 05:00.831
You don't remember what that total bill was?

05:00.811 --> 05:04.683
For the semester, probably $3,000, $3,500.

05:05.366 --> 05:07.352
And did you earn any of that?

05:07.452 --> 05:08.897
Did your family pay it?

05:09.063 --> 05:10.405
The family paid some of it.

05:10.525 --> 05:12.489
Some of it was from savings.

05:12.549 --> 05:15.053
Some of it was from scholarships.

05:15.073 --> 05:15.814
It just kind of varied.

05:17.237 --> 05:29.177
And as you look back, you, did A&M win out as to where you would go over any other institution or were you, did you even think about any other place?

05:29.458 --> 05:29.918
No, I did.

05:29.998 --> 05:34.446
I looked at, I guess, nine other schools, eight, nine other schools.

05:34.426 --> 05:35.808
Most of them weren't in Texas.

05:36.689 --> 05:37.750
Most of them were outside.

05:38.331 --> 05:41.375
So would I have come to this place knowing what I know now?

05:41.395 --> 05:42.176
Of course I would.

05:42.196 --> 05:45.580
I've enjoyed it, and it's been a great part of my life.

05:45.620 --> 05:49.645
So certainly I would have come here fully knowing everything else that's happened.

05:50.246 --> 05:56.674
Did A&M do a good job trying to recruit you after you indicated an interest?

05:56.694 --> 05:57.655
Actually, I'll be honest with you.

05:57.675 --> 06:01.800
I really didn't have much recruiting, which compared to some of my other friends said that they

06:02.118 --> 06:07.025
You know, did have some recruiting, whether it was the Corps or something else, scholastic reasons that brought them here.

06:07.085 --> 06:08.728
But no, I really didn't.

06:08.828 --> 06:09.549
Nobody called me.

06:09.589 --> 06:12.754
I just submitted my application, got accepted, and that was that.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.258
Nobody ever made any phone calls.

06:15.278 --> 06:17.801
You came in your grandfather's car.

06:18.963 --> 06:20.445
Who else came in that car?

06:20.465 --> 06:21.146
Just me and him.

06:21.367 --> 06:22.949
Just me and him who showed up.

06:22.969 --> 06:29.238
Who, what advice did he or your parents or older siblings give you as your beginning?

06:29.459 --> 06:30.420
What did they say?

06:32.054 --> 06:35.340
I don't think anybody really had much advice except don't screw up.

06:36.301 --> 06:37.143
I don't know.

06:37.163 --> 06:43.233
You know, I'm the oldest so it's not, the younger ones certainly can't really give too much advice.

06:44.536 --> 06:47.401
And then the older ones, this is a new experience for them too.

06:47.461 --> 06:51.848
They never really sent anybody to school at 18 years old to college.

06:51.869 --> 06:55.615
So I think a lot of that has been a learning experience for them too.

06:55.595 --> 07:02.085
But there was nothing that where mom or dad said, don't you dare flunk out, don't you?

07:02.626 --> 07:03.567
There was nothing like that?

07:03.868 --> 07:04.829
I don't know.

07:05.430 --> 07:13.122
My family's got some crazy stories in it, so I think they figured I couldn't do too much to top them, and if they didn't tell me, I might not do it then, so.

07:14.324 --> 07:20.033
Did any, was there any key teacher or counselor back in high school that...

07:20.418 --> 07:24.606
help prepare you for college, advise you?

07:24.626 --> 07:29.295
I can't say there was one person that necessarily prepared me for college.

07:29.596 --> 07:41.518
There were always a couple of teachers that would help and get you interested in some things outside just the typical high school thinking and encourage you to do something with it.

07:41.739 --> 07:43.422
And so that was exciting.

07:43.975 --> 07:48.381
And I think one of those was a government teacher, and she did a lot for me.

07:48.441 --> 07:51.405
So I think that kind of excited me to get interested in that.

07:51.525 --> 07:53.588
But I had a couple of them.

07:53.688 --> 08:01.738
There was also, I guess, a chemistry teacher that I had and wound up being, I guess, one of her assistants in the senior year high school.

08:01.758 --> 08:09.088
And she did a lot to help me get ready and just to encourage me to go out there and pursue some of those goals, whatever they may be.

08:09.727 --> 08:19.568
Did they or anyone else help you believe that A&M had a high credibility status, a high quality, an eminence?

08:20.476 --> 08:26.945
The person I got that the most from was a man by the name of Cliff Dugas, who works at the MSC now, didn't at the time.

08:27.747 --> 08:31.212
But we went to church together and did things in high school.

08:31.232 --> 08:36.980
He lived in San Antonio, but went to a rivalry across the street.

08:37.060 --> 08:40.225
So it was interesting, but he was always bragging about this place.

08:40.245 --> 08:44.731
And there were a few people, but nobody I really necessarily closely knew very much.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.395
Did you know what your major was going to be?

08:48.117 --> 09:10.072
Well I first got accepted with a scholarship in biochemistry only to say that there's no way in the world I'm going to do that and didn't tell my parents and changed it to political science and I'm glad I didn't tell them they probably would have been more concerned at the time but and now they're not they're not too concerned about it but I changed it kind of without them knowing that and did it before I got up here and so that's what I started out as.

09:10.092 --> 09:13.618
How did you how did you get your first

09:13.598 --> 09:15.703
semester of classes selected.

09:16.304 --> 09:18.409
How did you register that first time?

09:18.650 --> 09:27.490
I just figured I'd take the classes somewhat decent and I had no idea what to expect in terms of teachers and teacher quality or any of that so I kind of just took a

09:27.757 --> 09:31.683
really just a shot in the dark at the ones that I thought I might do the best at.

09:32.004 --> 09:35.990
Did you make those selections before you left home or did you come up here to pre-register?

09:36.310 --> 09:39.295
I came up here when I registered and looked at the book the night before.

09:39.515 --> 09:40.497
We had to go and register.

09:40.537 --> 09:44.042
I think registration was on the, I think it's the third day or fourth day.

09:44.062 --> 09:45.424
I'm not sure how long that program is.

09:45.484 --> 09:47.267
It's three or four days, but it was on the last day.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.911
So you registered right before you left to go back home.

09:49.931 --> 09:51.494
Was that process pretty efficient?

09:52.475 --> 09:53.116
I thought it was.

09:53.517 --> 09:55.620
It was still...

09:55.904 --> 09:57.527
Tough to understand what was going on.

09:57.567 --> 10:02.757
It was much more academically focused versus understanding the traditions and all the other things that encompassed A&M.

10:02.817 --> 10:07.927
So that made it a little bit more difficult to understand in terms of what you're really getting into.

10:07.987 --> 10:09.971
But I thought the process was good.

10:10.011 --> 10:13.137
Okay, you arrive in this Cadillac.

10:13.454 --> 10:17.359
Did you know what outfit you were going to be in when you got to campus that day?

10:18.040 --> 10:18.361
I did.

10:18.481 --> 10:30.438
I registered for an outfit K-1, and there was a guy that I knew in high school, not very well, but he was the only person I knew that was in the Corps and was in that outfit and said, you know, that's the outfit you need to come into.

10:30.498 --> 10:38.449
So I hadn't seen him in six months before I showed up, and I only had seen him once a year before that.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.173
It was the only place I knew to go, and that's what I signed up to do.

10:41.194 --> 10:46.723
Describe what it was like as you're taking your stuff into that dormitory and you're finding a room.

10:46.763 --> 10:49.227
Describe beginning in the Corps.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.671
Well, they found a room for me very quickly.

10:52.171 --> 10:57.019
I guess I don't know how long the process of coming in for Freshman Orientation Week has been.

10:57.921 --> 11:01.787
You go through Duncan and do the different registration process they've got there.

11:01.767 --> 11:30.238
keeps getting more and more advanced every year but and then they had already a dorm lined out a room for you and everything else like that when you got there so there wasn't too much figuring out you just had to go where you were directed but I think it was the first time I saw my friend again six months and and this time he was on the other end of it being a sophomore and so at first I thought it was funny when I saw him and he was trying to be mean and I got a big kick out of it only to get in trouble about five minutes after that and that's the way the freshman year started off so

11:30.218 --> 11:34.404
Describe being introduced to core traditionalism practices.

11:34.864 --> 11:58.977
I had to approach it with a sense of humor because I had no idea what I was getting into and there was this obviously this class that was going to be the disciplinarians without question and I think they made that pretty clear from the first time you've met them so I just I didn't know what I was expecting and what was serious and what wasn't and it didn't take me very long to figure out what was serious but but

11:59.564 --> 12:00.345
But it was interesting.

12:00.546 --> 12:08.438
Looking back on that first, those first few days and nights, was there anything that occurred that shouldn't have?

12:11.042 --> 12:12.244
I don't know if anything occurred.

12:12.284 --> 12:19.716
I think I'd heard a story of a guy who got so bothered by all the sophomores, they would walk up and down the hall just

12:19.763 --> 12:24.871
I guess we thought they were walking up and down all night long because they had taps on the bottom of their shoes.

12:24.911 --> 12:31.521
And I think I found out when I came back to do it my sophomore year, they only did it for about a half hour, but you were so tired you fell asleep really quickly.

12:31.982 --> 12:33.604
And they'd get up about a half hour before us.

12:34.165 --> 12:39.493
But I think one of the freshmen got so bothered by that and so bothered by the whole

12:40.132 --> 12:46.241
just I guess being under a different kind of atmosphere that he jumped out of his window, took all the stuff and ran home that night.

12:46.342 --> 12:47.503
So I don't know.

12:47.563 --> 12:50.788
I never saw him and everybody was pretty sure that that happened.

12:51.650 --> 12:55.856
Did that first few days and nights, did you see a paddle ever used?

12:56.397 --> 12:57.699
No, I can't say I did.

12:57.739 --> 13:00.283
Nobody ever brought it up.

13:00.263 --> 13:03.530
Everybody that during that first week thought, oh my gosh, this is so tough.

13:03.570 --> 13:07.057
But I think the tough guy, it got tougher the further on you went.

13:07.117 --> 13:09.682
The first week when I look back at it was actually the easiest.

13:09.742 --> 13:11.125
It just was different.

13:11.506 --> 13:17.698
And your official lady, how did you describe getting acquainted with him and so forth?

13:18.337 --> 13:23.845
I don't know how to really describe him except I pretty much gave him about two or three weeks to make it and he was out.

13:23.905 --> 13:30.535
He was a really nice guy and he's still a good friend.

13:30.996 --> 13:36.885
But he came in that first evening and he just was very shy, very quiet.

13:36.865 --> 13:41.875
Didn't look like he really wanted to be there, wasn't really sure if that's what he wanted to do.

13:42.717 --> 13:54.520
Very anal, had his highlighters for his books or whatever, color coordinated from darkest to lightest in his desk drawer, and I thought, oh my gosh, if this is what's to come, I have no idea.

13:54.787 --> 14:04.940
He, over the course of a year, developed so much personality from being in that and did a great job and stayed in and did well for himself.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.483
So he stayed in?

14:07.503 --> 14:07.823
He did.

14:07.923 --> 14:09.826
I just didn't expect him to when he first showed up.

14:10.647 --> 14:13.831
Describe what was in that room your freshman year.

14:14.091 --> 14:17.335
Describe the freshman room in modern times.

14:17.315 --> 14:47.001
I don't know if it from my understanding I don't know if it really changed all that much from what it was 50 years ago and the dorms are that old and haven't really been renovated so there's not too much difference but it bunk beds and I think dependent the room opens up with a little bit larger side of the room either on the left or the right depending on which dorm it is but anyway they the bunk beds would be placed in that corner and there were two desks and two dressers and

14:47.285 --> 14:48.027
That was about it.

14:48.047 --> 14:51.857
I don't think there was really else mattresses on there, but everything else you had to furnish.

14:52.840 --> 14:57.432
And, of course, we weren't really allowed to furnish much in freshman year, so we didn't have a whole lot.

14:57.532 --> 15:00.820
But you could bring in a footlocker, so both of us had a footlocker.

15:01.843 --> 15:04.129
And that was pretty much all that was in there.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.127
Now here I'm about to ask a naive question.

15:07.147 --> 15:09.572
Could you have a keyboard and a computer?

15:09.592 --> 15:11.497
Yes, you could have a keyboard and a computer.

15:11.517 --> 15:12.579
Oh, okay.

15:12.739 --> 15:13.361
You could bring that.

15:13.902 --> 15:14.844
Did both of you have one?

15:15.446 --> 15:16.528
He had one, I didn't.

15:17.009 --> 15:22.742
I wound up later getting one, so then I think somewhere in the middle of the year we both had one.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.786
No, you could bring up anything that was for academic purposes.

15:25.846 --> 15:29.051
You just couldn't bring up any kind of television or radio or anything like that.

15:29.071 --> 15:30.232
And no mini refrigerator?

15:30.373 --> 15:31.314
No.

15:31.334 --> 15:34.859
No electric coffee pot and all that?

15:34.899 --> 15:36.762
No, couldn't have any of that stuff, so.

15:38.424 --> 15:39.606
Were it curtains, rug?

15:40.687 --> 15:41.408
No, there was nothing.

15:41.448 --> 15:42.750
It was just a tile floor.

15:42.850 --> 15:44.653
There wasn't anything else to it.

15:45.514 --> 15:46.034
No curtains.

15:46.075 --> 15:50.721
There was obviously blinds that were part of the room, but there wasn't anything that we had furnished.

15:50.937 --> 15:54.680
How did you get acquainted with the entire campus geographically?

15:54.720 --> 15:55.741
Did you go exploring?

15:57.202 --> 15:59.344
No, there wasn't really a lot of time to go exploring.

15:59.364 --> 16:01.806
If you weren't going to class, they wanted you to be back in the dorm.

16:01.866 --> 16:04.028
So there wasn't a lot of time to do that.

16:04.208 --> 16:09.393
I think really you just learn from going to your different classes, from going to different activities.

16:09.473 --> 16:13.837
And after a while, I mean, even though it's a big campus, it doesn't become quite as big.

16:13.897 --> 16:17.199
And people were always helping to show you where things were.

16:17.239 --> 16:20.202
So it wasn't too difficult to find your way around.

16:20.890 --> 16:23.535
And how did you learn the routine in the chai hall?

16:24.496 --> 16:28.664
The nicknames and... Very quickly because you had to.

16:29.926 --> 16:35.296
Sophomores that were with us always insisted that we know that and there was always repercussions for not.

16:35.336 --> 16:39.183
So it didn't take long to figure out you needed to know what they told you you needed to know.

16:39.223 --> 16:41.988
And it was always on a progressive scale.

16:42.329 --> 16:44.232
You didn't have to know it all at once.

16:44.212 --> 16:48.220
Certainly by minute middle of the fall semester you had to know all of that.

16:48.320 --> 16:52.669
And did you all ask for food with all of the appropriate Aggie nicknames?

16:53.590 --> 16:53.931
We did.

16:53.951 --> 17:04.251
I think some outfits had some different routines that they had but my outfit did do that and we had to always had to know the names of or the handles of the chow.

17:04.672 --> 17:05.173
You couldn't

17:05.457 --> 17:11.666
You couldn't eat your chow unless you knew what the name of your chow was, so we always had to do that.

17:11.686 --> 17:13.789
Were there cush questions in your outfit?

17:13.809 --> 17:15.532
Sometimes there were, sometimes there weren't.

17:15.872 --> 17:19.838
Not as much as from what I recall from former students, but we still didn't.

17:19.858 --> 17:23.063
Do you have a favorite cush question to share?

17:23.083 --> 17:23.663
Oh, I don't know.

17:23.743 --> 17:29.151
I'm not sure if we, you know, I think there was, I'm trying to remember what it was.

17:29.892 --> 17:35.160
You know, even though it's a couple of years ago, you forget because you're not really that bothered by it anymore.

17:35.528 --> 17:43.737
I think we used to ask, I think when the flag flew, I'm trying to remember how many stars were on the flag.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.499
On the Texas flag?

17:45.719 --> 17:45.960
Right.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.202
So, you know, on the Texas flag.

17:48.242 --> 17:51.306
So, you know, of course, the freshman would say, one.

17:51.326 --> 17:52.227
You'd say, no, it's two.

17:52.807 --> 17:53.568
It's on both sides.

17:54.169 --> 17:56.291
And then, of course, you'd ask him again, and then he'd say, two.

17:56.311 --> 17:59.775
And you'd say, no, it's one solid star right through both flags.

17:59.795 --> 18:02.498
So it was a no-win question, but it was fun to ask.

18:02.866 --> 18:12.422
All right, that first fall, did you have some courses and or some instructors that now you realize were important to you?

18:14.405 --> 18:17.591
How important was that first fall academically?

18:17.611 --> 18:21.938
Probably was my worst semester academically.

18:23.470 --> 18:30.699
It was a little bit challenging just because you had to get used to some of the different pace of the courses and what they were requiring.

18:31.861 --> 18:39.971
That first semester, I think I've kind of found, along with everybody else, that you don't always necessarily get the best quality teachers when you first show up.

18:40.011 --> 18:45.298
A lot of them are graduate students and they recognize that everybody really just has to take those classes.

18:45.378 --> 18:47.200
It's not necessarily what they want to do.

18:47.180 --> 18:57.049
So you don't necessarily get some of the PhDs or the doctors you'll get later on that know a little bit more about what they're talking about and are obviously a lot more interested in what you're doing.

18:57.089 --> 19:02.254
So I think everybody just wants to get through the first couple of hard classes and then move into the stuff they really enjoy.

19:02.694 --> 19:06.458
As you look back, were some of those sections too large in number of students?

19:07.098 --> 19:07.679
I think so.

19:07.719 --> 19:09.220
Some of them are as large as 400.

19:09.320 --> 19:16.647
I think some people in business said that I think they were maybe as close as 500 in some sections, which is,

19:17.133 --> 19:18.214
I think it's too many.

19:19.075 --> 19:31.708
I think you could pretty much rest assured that most of your classes the first year were going to be at least 100 people, unless maybe your English courses, which were, I think, maybe 25 or 30 people in that.

19:31.808 --> 19:35.812
But most of them were pretty large, and then they quickly sized down from there.

19:37.154 --> 19:40.718
Describe a typical day for you, a typical class day.

19:40.758 --> 19:44.001
You got up at about what time, went to chow, went to class.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.911
Go from getting up to going to sleep.

19:46.931 --> 19:53.163
Well, usually, you know, depending on what you had to do that morning, we got up somewhere between 5.30, 5.45.

19:54.886 --> 20:00.476
Usually ran in the morning, but some mornings there were inspections, so sometimes you had to get up a little bit earlier.

20:00.576 --> 20:07.609
But you had to be out by 6 o'clock in the morning so we could turn on the lights and wake up the upperclassmen.

20:07.673 --> 20:20.154
do the regular chores that you had to get into doing, blow and call, which consisted of telling the food that was being served that day and temperature and weather and all the other things the upperclassmen wanted to know.

20:20.214 --> 20:22.537
And sometimes they had extras they wanted you to throw in there.

20:23.359 --> 20:26.484
So that went on for about 30 minutes or so.

20:26.804 --> 20:28.928
Then we usually went out to formation about 630.

20:29.048 --> 20:33.816
I think it actually was held at 640, but you were outside by 630.

20:34.319 --> 20:40.788
We'd go through Reveille, and then we'd march into Chow, and I think we were in and out of there probably.

20:41.369 --> 20:45.034
I think we were on our way back by no later than 7-15, 7-10, 7-15.

20:46.576 --> 20:48.599
And we'd come back to the dorm.

20:48.639 --> 20:53.005
Of course, all the sophomores' levels left before us, and upperclassmen would bring us back.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.310
So usually got to...

20:56.932 --> 21:02.144
horse around and do some good bull on the way back because you didn't have anybody to really do anything to you.

21:02.785 --> 21:08.578
And then you came back and usually there was something they always wanted to discipline you for when you came back, but after that,

21:08.930 --> 21:12.995
You know, they quickly tried to get you out to class for everybody that had 8 o'clock.

21:13.836 --> 21:16.379
And then you went to your classes.

21:16.459 --> 21:19.182
I guess sometimes there were other chores if you didn't have 8 o'clock classes.

21:19.763 --> 21:28.913
Delivering battalions to upperclassmen or maybe something needed to be done out in the hall or cleaning up the hall or different just remedial chores.

21:28.973 --> 21:31.016
But otherwise you went to your class.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.098
I think we all tried to eat lunch.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.552
one or two times during the day.

21:35.612 --> 21:37.294
We didn't have any formation or anything like that.

21:37.414 --> 21:42.539
I know that some of the earlier classes used to have a formation, lunchtime formation.

21:43.140 --> 21:49.106
I think there were, I'm not sure how many formations there were, but most people typically tend to eat between one to two times.

21:49.126 --> 21:50.988
I think it was either 11.30 or 12.30.

21:51.428 --> 21:53.150
But you all didn't eat as an outfit?

21:53.731 --> 21:56.453
Not as an entire outfit.

21:56.473 --> 22:00.157
Did we sit with our outfit, those that were eating lunch at that particular time?

22:00.277 --> 22:00.537
Yes.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.000
We sat down with them.

22:02.980 --> 22:05.832
Otherwise we didn't eat as an entire outfit like we did in the morning.

22:06.996 --> 22:13.041
And finished after classes for the day and then you'd come back and usually there was some core activity between

22:13.561 --> 22:37.020
starting about four o'clock in the afternoon until about six or so such as what kind of thing could be inspections sometimes inspections maybe you're running maybe you're playing football with your maybe they had an intramural game that you needed to play um so it varied sometimes it was more serious sometimes it was a lot of fun and usually that changed the year went on and got later too people a lot a lot more of it was fun activities

22:37.523 --> 22:42.390
Was your outfit highly concerned about intramurals?

22:43.672 --> 22:45.575
We were pretty concerned about intramurals.

22:45.615 --> 22:46.797
I think we took it pretty serious.

22:46.837 --> 22:52.866
Not as much as some other outfits, but I would say we were probably in the top five of intramurals.

22:53.888 --> 22:59.577
And most of the men in your, well, men and women majored in what?

22:59.597 --> 23:00.438
What kind of subjects?

23:01.499 --> 23:02.661
I think it was all across the board.

23:02.701 --> 23:05.826
My outfit was originally an engineering outfit.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.608
That's when it was created, I think it started in 1969.

23:09.832 --> 23:12.701
So that's originally what it was.

23:13.363 --> 23:18.499
Mine's one of the few outfits that's still all male that's left, so there's actually not women in it.

23:19.188 --> 23:24.020
And I think most people were engineering or agriculture simply because those were the two biggest majors on campus.

23:24.782 --> 23:28.932
But there were certainly others, but I think it got a lot smaller from there.

23:29.433 --> 23:36.370
If you had any spare time unscheduled in the afternoon, what did you do with that time?

23:36.839 --> 23:41.948
I think at first everybody usually would come back to the dorm just because you didn't know if there was something you had to do.

23:42.509 --> 23:49.100
And then as you started figuring out the game a little bit more, a lot of times it didn't come back and we either went to go grab a bite to eat someplace.

23:49.560 --> 23:49.781
Where?

23:49.841 --> 23:55.270
I don't know, sometimes maybe we'd run to

23:55.250 --> 24:01.259
I don't know, some of the shops, I think they had, there's some shops over on George Bush at Jason's Deli and stuff like that.

24:01.279 --> 24:12.076
We'd run over there, go visit one of our friends, brothers or sisters that was living off campus, go try to catch some television program or just horse around a little bit and run some errands.

24:13.558 --> 24:20.329
But it was also fun to be in the dorm too because everybody was there and you knew everybody and you lived with them 24 hours a day.

24:20.714 --> 24:25.300
You know, there was a lot of fun to being in the dorm that you didn't always catch when you were missing it.

24:26.221 --> 24:28.745
Did you make some important friendships that first semester?

24:29.265 --> 24:29.906
Oh, I think so.

24:30.026 --> 24:36.014
I mean, when you live with somebody, like I said, 24 hours a day, you know, you learn a lot about people very quickly.

24:36.575 --> 24:42.503
So, you know, you've made a lot of good friendships and ones that I think probably would have taken me longer to develop other places.

24:42.905 --> 24:47.053
You know, certainly everybody develops their friendships differently.

24:48.696 --> 24:55.791
Then in the evening, come back for chow, fall in, what would you do?

24:55.851 --> 24:59.057
Was the evening chow routine different?

24:59.375 --> 25:03.702
No, it was pretty much the same thing, just a different time, I think, although it was pretty close.

25:03.742 --> 25:05.685
I think it was 6.30, maybe instead of 6.40.

25:05.705 --> 25:13.939
I don't know if that really mattered, but it was the same process, being out there about 10 minutes early and blowing calls about a half hour early.

25:13.999 --> 25:16.122
And so it was the same routine coming back.

25:16.142 --> 25:19.628
And then we would come back after evening chow, I think,

25:20.401 --> 25:25.948
called a quarter, started somewhere around 7 or 7.30, and it varied from year to year.

25:26.108 --> 25:35.319
Sometimes it moved from formation times to different times, but you're pretty consistently back by 10 or 10.30, or by 7.30, I'm sorry.

25:35.559 --> 25:39.644
After chow, where did you normally go in the evenings?

25:39.664 --> 25:41.306
Stayed in the room and studied.

25:41.346 --> 25:47.674
You had to stay there unless you were going to the library or some study review session or something like that.

25:47.924 --> 25:53.918
How often did you or anybody else that you know go to the library at night?

25:55.130 --> 25:58.294
I think a lot more of us went to the library in the day because it was a good place to sleep.

25:58.354 --> 26:00.376
I don't know how many of us really went there at night.

26:01.097 --> 26:03.020
Sometimes we would.

26:03.040 --> 26:09.568
I think towards the end of the semester we learned on the sixth floor they had a place where you could go watch movies.

26:09.628 --> 26:14.373
So we'd rent out the place for 15 of us and we'd go watch a movie and study in the library.

26:15.675 --> 26:19.720
I'm not sure it really did much for our grades, but it was a lot more entertaining than being in the dorm sometimes.

26:21.556 --> 26:27.718
But then you're back in the dorm by what hour?

26:28.323 --> 26:33.989
You had to be bagged by, I think, 10 o'clock because then usually the lights out were 10.30, 11.

26:34.169 --> 26:40.135
I think it changed once or twice during my four years, but it was pretty consistently between 10.30 and 11.

26:42.157 --> 26:49.064
Share some of the reminiscences you had from that first semester about jokes, pranks, good bull.

26:49.944 --> 26:51.446
We did all kinds of things.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.588
I think pranks were played.

26:54.074 --> 27:03.179
during my first two years, and we did towards the last two years, usually because you had other things you were worried about, more focused on school or girlfriends or whatever.

27:03.280 --> 27:09.838
So you didn't quite do as much of it, I don't think, unless you were one of those guys that didn't have anything else to do.

27:10.223 --> 27:15.833
We did everything from put tuna fish in the phones and the receivers in the bottoms of the phones and waited for them to figure it out.

27:16.735 --> 27:25.752
We used to drop things down the air vents up in the corners, take fishing line and tie it around the vents so you couldn't see it and drop it down because I think the

27:26.103 --> 27:28.345
the air vent went about six feet, seven feet tall.

27:29.386 --> 27:32.869
So if you could get it halfway, you couldn't really reach up and you couldn't really reach down.

27:32.929 --> 27:36.733
So we'd leave things in there for them to figure out what was there.

27:38.674 --> 27:39.715
We'd do all kinds of things.

27:39.755 --> 27:46.601
I think we'd sometimes go in the middle of the night, put shaving cream on the top receiver of the phone, call them, and then let them pick them up so they'd go in their ears.

27:47.182 --> 27:47.963
That was always fun.

27:49.544 --> 27:50.605
So it was different.

27:50.785 --> 27:56.110
As you look back, do you remember any good bull that you or your friends were involved in

27:56.090 --> 28:03.417
which in fact was ill-advised, was harmful, shouldn't have done it.

28:04.358 --> 28:07.322
Most of the things we did I don't think were really harmful.

28:07.703 --> 28:11.248
I mean, sometimes people had a habit of doing that.

28:11.428 --> 28:14.993
I don't really recall a lot of activities that were really harmful.

28:16.035 --> 28:17.236
Did we do a lot of pranks?

28:17.397 --> 28:17.597
Yes.

28:19.179 --> 28:32.458
You know, I know during Ewok and some other times people would get tied up and put in different places, but it was never very long and nobody was really, I don't think anybody was ever put in serious harm.

28:32.438 --> 28:35.602
So I can't really recall any instances like that.

28:35.842 --> 28:41.588
Nobody was left outside or anything like that in the middle of the night, and I can't really recall anything like that.

28:41.869 --> 28:47.635
Did you ever go down into any of the tunnels, the steam tunnels?

28:47.795 --> 28:53.321
I didn't, but there were certainly some friends that did, and I think they got, I don't know how many hours of community service they got.

28:53.341 --> 28:56.325
You think you're supposed to get expelled from doing that, I think.

28:56.605 --> 28:56.745
Really?

28:56.765 --> 28:57.366
Oh, I didn't know that.

28:57.768 --> 29:06.097
That's what my understanding is, but there were some of them that went down there, and of course they came up just in time for the cops to catch them as they were coming out.

29:06.137 --> 29:14.045
So I think, I don't know what they really have to monitor it down there, but I think the rumor is there's sensors so they know when people are down there.

29:14.165 --> 29:21.693
I don't know if that's true or not, but certainly I think it's kept a lot of people from going down there just because the repercussions for going down there are so serious.

29:22.494 --> 29:26.138
As you went to class, what did you soon learn

29:26.337 --> 29:30.484
were the guidelines for class attendance and behavior in class?

29:30.984 --> 29:32.467
It varied from teacher to teacher.

29:33.008 --> 29:43.925
I saw everything from some guys would go to their class, and even some upper classmen, they'd show up with their golf clubs and ask if they were taking attendance that day, and if they weren't, they'd go off to the golf course and play golf.

29:43.945 --> 29:46.129
And then other places were very strict.

29:46.169 --> 29:53.661
You know, other teachers, I had another teacher that, you know, if you had to have any classes that you needed to miss,

29:53.641 --> 29:54.983
throughout the course of the semester.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.167
You had to let her know prior to the end of the first week.

29:57.728 --> 30:01.114
Other than that, her class took precedence over anything else.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.538
So it really varied from teacher to teacher.

30:03.779 --> 30:13.135
You just had to, after a while, I think you find out which teachers are more lenient and which are less, and sometimes people shape their classes around that.

30:13.385 --> 30:17.810
Was anybody checking the roll every day from the teachers?

30:17.890 --> 30:18.490
Some people did.

30:18.530 --> 30:19.652
Some people checked the roll.

30:20.172 --> 30:23.996
Other people felt that that was a little childish and it was your responsibility.

30:24.437 --> 30:36.810
They knew that that meant people would skip sometimes, but then, you know, they were also less willing to change your grades at the end of the semester if there was any kind of situation that you felt they needed to look in.

30:36.790 --> 30:42.056
Now, you said that first year was not your, that first semester and all was not your best semester academically.

30:42.077 --> 30:42.377
That's right.

30:42.517 --> 30:47.703
When did you first start getting those grades in or those tests?

30:48.044 --> 30:48.765
Describe that.

30:49.386 --> 30:51.588
Well, the first time I got grades in the first semester?

30:52.509 --> 30:56.715
Oh, I, the classes I were taking were, weren't necessarily hard.

30:56.735 --> 30:58.697
I think I just didn't,

30:58.677 --> 31:01.741
know the quality of the things that they were looking for.

31:01.861 --> 31:04.584
So they were varied.

31:04.604 --> 31:10.592
Sometimes I'd get a good A back, and then a lot of times I'd get some Ds and Fs, and you don't know what to expect.

31:10.652 --> 31:19.923
And since there's so fewer tests and fewer homeworks, and some people don't even have any kind of homework assignments that, you know, you get a little bit nervous about how do I pull that grade up.

31:20.624 --> 31:25.410
But you quickly figure out how to do that and how to get used to their tests and how to study for them.
