WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:09.442
And he ran into some things down there that he hadn't even dreamed about at Miami.

00:10.304 --> 00:17.685
And he left there and was probably the number two man with the Atlanta Olympic Committee.

00:17.665 --> 00:23.856
scheduling of events and working with the foreign, I mean, the international federations, which he had a big job.

00:23.996 --> 00:37.240
Then after that, he went to work for Turner Sports as vice president and since then has left there and has in Sacramento and working with a group trying to bring professional soccer to Sacramento.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.968
So he's done well and he's stayed involved in track and field.

00:42.455 --> 00:45.398
and we visit several times a year.

00:45.438 --> 00:56.691
Of all your shot put rivals, I'll try to ask this tactfully, which competitor did you enjoy beating most?

00:57.392 --> 00:58.433
That would be hard to say.

00:58.513 --> 01:00.575
I enjoyed beating several of them a lot.

01:01.256 --> 01:08.364
Now early on I had a lot of admiration for the guys when I was coming up that I'd heard about.

01:10.086 --> 01:11.027
I took a lot of

01:11.480 --> 01:12.181
It was different.

01:12.201 --> 01:14.823
I enjoyed beating Dallas Long the one time I beat him.

01:14.843 --> 01:21.130
I enjoyed beating Perry O'Brien, but it was more because I had such respect for them and what they'd accomplished.

01:21.150 --> 01:36.105
My contemporaries when I competed against, my main competitors, a fellow named George Woods, Neil Steinheier, Al Feuerbach, and then later Brian Oldfield.

01:36.125 --> 01:38.668
And it would be hard to say which one of them I enjoyed.

01:40.066 --> 01:57.517
beating the most, I think probably I disliked losing the most to probably, well, maybe Steinheier, but we were close in college.

01:57.537 --> 01:58.378
He was at Oregon.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.111
contemporaries.

02:01.191 --> 02:03.095
We weren't close in San Francisco.

02:03.135 --> 02:04.578
Fuerbach was a little different.

02:06.121 --> 02:18.425
He came along when things were, he was a little, had long hair and wore ponytail and stuff and so we were complete opposites the way we approached things and but he was a very good shot player.

02:18.445 --> 02:19.287
He wasn't real big

02:19.891 --> 02:26.381
guy and shot putters go was very good technique-wise and ended up breaking my record.

02:28.204 --> 02:32.370
And then George Woods, I really didn't like him beating me either.

02:33.472 --> 02:47.113
And Oldfield was such a maverick and disregard for what I considered the way athletes are supposed to conduct themselves and train, even though I did probably visit with him more and

02:48.038 --> 02:51.943
and spend a little more time with him, even though we were complete opposites when it came out.

02:51.983 --> 02:56.830
But by then, it was later in my career, and I'd mellowed a little bit on this competition thing.

02:56.870 --> 03:05.802
I used to, I grew up a time you really had to dislike your competitors to compete as hard as you need to against them, and that's the way I approached it.

03:06.403 --> 03:13.573
Probably if I had to do it over, I might do that a little different, but I was really intense.

03:14.060 --> 03:17.846
and competing against them, and it was important to me not to lose to them.

03:17.866 --> 03:22.814
Now, you were, by California standards, a square since you didn't smoke and you didn't drink.

03:23.395 --> 03:27.140
Did some of those other guys in those days, were they smokers and drinkers?

03:27.160 --> 03:28.863
Sure, yeah.

03:28.883 --> 03:35.173
Oldfield's the only one that smoked I knew about, and Feuerbach, even though he was

03:36.183 --> 03:40.329
kind of the free spirit kind of the way that he would dress and look.

03:40.509 --> 03:44.635
Probably didn't do as much of that because he was so, he trained very hard.

03:45.497 --> 03:48.701
Or Oldfield didn't pay a lot of attention to how he took care of himself.

03:50.083 --> 03:51.986
George Woods didn't do a lot of that.

03:52.747 --> 03:57.615
And Steinheier didn't either.

03:57.655 --> 03:58.596
They were pretty,

03:58.913 --> 04:09.578
Now, you know, there's some of the guys that were, but it was important to them, and most of the time they didn't want to do anything that would hurt the way they competed.

04:10.220 --> 04:11.924
Except for Oldfield.

04:11.944 --> 04:13.869
He never worried about it, but that was the way he competed.

04:14.029 --> 04:15.252
He was just...

04:15.468 --> 04:21.238
reckless abandon, you know, and it's the way he approached it, and that was just him.

04:22.059 --> 04:25.344
And there wasn't any marijuana?

04:25.745 --> 04:27.528
Didn't know about any of that early then.

04:28.349 --> 04:37.825
You know, we'd heard about it, but I... In terms of the shot put form that y'all used, did everybody use about the same form then?

04:39.027 --> 04:40.229
Until O'Fill came along.

04:40.309 --> 04:41.391
O'Fill used a spin.

04:41.371 --> 04:42.317
Was he the first one?

04:42.437 --> 04:43.967
And he revolutionized that.

04:44.067 --> 04:44.993
Where did that come from?

04:45.033 --> 04:45.677
Do you know?

04:46.315 --> 04:48.839
Oh I'd seen a few guys experimenting with it.

04:51.382 --> 04:54.907
But he was the first one that was real successful with it.

04:54.927 --> 05:01.076
And you know I guess the people that analyzed it felt like you could build up more speed that way.

05:01.637 --> 05:05.222
I felt like the ring was not big enough and too restrictive.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.146
And I think it was harder for a tall person to do that.

05:09.088 --> 05:16.238
Of course then Randy Barnes came along and took it even further and he was a pretty good sized fellow.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.133
I'm glad I threw what I did.

05:19.173 --> 05:24.760
Now, you threw the discus some.

05:26.282 --> 05:27.203
Why not more?

05:27.724 --> 05:30.908
Well, I felt like the discus took away from the shot a little.

05:32.230 --> 05:41.562
And when it came down to the Olympics or to major competitions, the shot put was my, that was what I was a record holder in.

05:41.622 --> 05:44.245
That's what I had to protect my position in.

05:44.285 --> 05:47.389
That's what I was expected to do well in.

05:47.723 --> 05:56.095
The discus was a little more inconsistent as far as the distance by the nature of the spin and the wind and other factors.

05:56.135 --> 05:58.058
Weather influenced it a lot more.

05:59.140 --> 06:05.289
You could be really ready to throw in the wind from the wrong direction and take 20 feet off of it and you still throw well technically.

06:05.529 --> 06:07.352
So I like the shot better.

06:07.703 --> 06:14.713
Looking back, I probably should have been a better discus thrower by the built, the long arms and the long levers.

06:17.417 --> 06:24.126
Generally, especially in the early years, I trained with the discus only after I had completely finished working out with the shot.

06:24.406 --> 06:25.408
That's what I thought.

06:25.448 --> 06:36.343
When I broke the American record in the discus in Kyle Field with 213.9 and came within an inch and a half of the world record that day, I had been injured in the shot.

06:37.252 --> 06:42.120
and wasn't able to throw for two or three weeks with a hand injury that didn't affect the discus.

06:42.601 --> 06:44.584
And so all I did is go out and work on the discus.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.930
The weightlifting was a little different for the two.

06:48.431 --> 06:58.568
The timing in the Olympics where one's a couple of days off the other, you rest for one, then you've rested too long for the other one, and I worried about that.

06:58.902 --> 07:09.956
I kind of wished at times now that after 68 I would have came back and said, all right, I'm going to throw the discus for a couple of years and I'm not going to pick up the shot.

07:10.657 --> 07:22.632
But I still felt like I had a long throw left in me in the shot and I ended up throwing close to the world record in 1970 and had probably not one of my best years in 1970.

07:22.612 --> 07:28.480
I never was willing to give the shot up and do that.

07:29.422 --> 07:35.370
It seemed to me that when I saw you throw the disc, it seemed to me that you were relaxed.

07:36.532 --> 07:37.914
The disc was kind of like, okay.

07:39.596 --> 07:44.643
You had to be relaxed a little bit in the discus because it was more of a technique event than a shot.

07:44.703 --> 07:48.248
The shot was a little, even though it was more technique than most would think,

07:48.835 --> 07:57.663
The shot being heavy and round, it was more of an explosive power event, and the discus took a little more finesse.

07:58.483 --> 08:08.672
Even though the best discus throws were very strong, at least as strong as shot putters and big, but it still took a little more fine finesse.

08:08.692 --> 08:12.636
No matter how strong you are, if you don't hit that discus right, it would punish you.

08:13.036 --> 08:17.560
And a lot of real good shot putters, most good shot putters couldn't throw the discus very well.

08:18.113 --> 08:24.142
In the Southwest Conference you were, won the shot all three, four years?

08:24.303 --> 08:24.683
Yes.

08:24.703 --> 08:26.486
Well, freshmen weren't eligible.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.167
Okay.

08:27.187 --> 08:32.676
My freshman year I threw farther than the varsity, but I wasn't eligible.

08:32.696 --> 08:33.397
The freshmen threw.

08:33.637 --> 08:35.220
Then you won the next three years.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.281
Then I won the next three years.

08:36.301 --> 08:36.742
NCAA.

08:37.824 --> 08:39.987
I won the NCAA.

08:41.452 --> 08:47.765
two years I didn't compete in my sophomore year in the NCAA or AAU.

08:49.870 --> 08:50.411
Two reasons.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.938
One, I had a knee injury and I wanted to rest it.

08:54.099 --> 08:55.421
I'd gone straight through.

08:55.441 --> 09:01.013
In 64 I never took a break and I'd gone straight through and I was tired.

09:01.786 --> 09:15.224
One of the real reasons was that was when the NCAA and the AAU were in the big feud of who controlled amateur athletics, especially track and field in this country, especially for international competition.

09:15.244 --> 09:20.892
The AAU had said at that time, any college,

09:21.243 --> 09:29.056
I mean, excuse me, the NCAA had said any college athlete that competes in the AAU meet, which we're not sanctioning, will be ineligible.

09:29.076 --> 09:30.999
Their school will have to make them ineligible.

09:31.199 --> 09:31.560
We won't.

09:31.620 --> 09:32.582
Their school will have to.

09:33.443 --> 09:37.009
That put me in a real strain because I didn't want to do that to the school.

09:37.870 --> 09:41.697
At the same time, the AAU said they can make you ineligible.

09:41.977 --> 09:45.042
They told me, we'll pay for your college education.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.204
You can go wherever you want.

09:47.467 --> 09:53.178
And so I'm in a dilemma to have to go to the AAU meeting to compete internationally.

09:54.059 --> 09:56.945
The NCAA is saying, no, you know, you can't do that.

09:58.187 --> 10:00.491
So I wasn't going to do either.

10:00.892 --> 10:05.340
And then the AAU came back and said, well, you know, the Russians are ready for us and waiting on us.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.281
There's an exception.

10:06.321 --> 10:09.346
Your knee hurts, so we made an injury exception for you.

10:09.927 --> 10:17.337
If you'll come out here in a field at a high school here in Houston and show us that you're in shape, we'll put you on the team automatic.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.080
So I went out and I threw 60.

10:19.680 --> 10:26.410
They'd already had the AU and 63 feet won the shot, and I threw 66 in the field.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.254
I had a summer job down in Houston.

10:29.274 --> 10:32.779
So they said, we want you to go to Russia and you owe it to the country.

10:33.873 --> 10:36.415
I said, well, that's pretty heavy, but what about the NCAA?

10:37.557 --> 10:38.818
Well, you didn't go to the AAU meet.

10:38.858 --> 10:41.120
They don't have any say over it.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.902
They don't have any say over international meets.

10:44.463 --> 10:47.006
But we're going to have a tune-up meet in Wichita.

10:47.506 --> 10:48.387
That's in the U.S.

10:49.848 --> 10:53.672
And the team will compete there and then fly to Russia.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.834
And the AAU said, you can't do that.

10:57.376 --> 11:02.040
So I went, I talked to Coach Thomas.

11:03.370 --> 11:07.658
And the athletic director was Fulberg still then.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.523
And I said, what am I supposed to do?

11:12.546 --> 11:14.470
Well, I called President Rudder.

11:17.074 --> 11:19.559
He said, who said you can't compete against the Russians?

11:20.921 --> 11:21.722
He called a meeting.

11:23.405 --> 11:25.429
He got Coach Thomas.

11:27.130 --> 11:31.093
Fulberg, President Rutter, sitting there, and me.

11:32.034 --> 11:33.716
And he doesn't pay any attention to them.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.978
He says, explain this deal to me.

11:35.998 --> 11:37.939
And I said, well, I want to compete against the Russians.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.361
He said, I want you to if you want to.

11:40.682 --> 11:42.303
I said, but the NCAA won't let me.

11:42.684 --> 11:43.264
He said, who?

11:43.945 --> 11:53.753
I said, well, they'll make, if I compete for A&M, then that's a violation on A&M, so they're going to put it on you to take my scholarship away.

11:54.814 --> 11:55.635
He said, who?

11:56.290 --> 11:58.493
Well, Walter Byers is head of the NCAA.

11:58.573 --> 12:00.856
He's kind of the czar in controlling.

12:02.218 --> 12:05.502
He called his secretary and said, get Mr. Byers on the telephone.

12:07.705 --> 12:08.466
Well, he's not in.

12:08.726 --> 12:10.468
He's in Chicago or something.

12:10.488 --> 12:11.630
He says, I want to talk to him.

12:11.670 --> 12:13.352
Tell him Earl Rutter wants to talk to him.

12:13.372 --> 12:13.893
The Texans ain't in.

12:13.913 --> 12:17.818
Well, he called back, and the conversation went something like this.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.943
Randy Madsen wants to compete against the Russians.

12:22.582 --> 12:27.011
He wants to go to Wichita to be in the best possible condition and compete there.

12:27.893 --> 12:30.478
Now, you're saying he can't do that?

12:32.742 --> 12:40.939
And I couldn't hear that in the conversation except that I'm going to call Lyndon Johnson.

12:41.741 --> 12:43.003
And then we'll see.

12:43.608 --> 12:50.477
And that's all I remember about that except the NCAA didn't ask for them to certify it.

12:50.597 --> 12:52.200
The AAU certified it anyway.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.943
And there was only two college guys that were there.

12:55.144 --> 13:01.212
One was a guy named Lindgren from Washington State who the NCAA tried to make ineligible.

13:01.232 --> 13:02.854
He just said, forget it.

13:03.375 --> 13:06.098
He went to the AAU and said, I'm going to challenge you on it.

13:06.459 --> 13:08.762
And they backed off eventually.

13:08.782 --> 13:13.328
But I competed in the meet.

13:13.848 --> 13:16.634
that was unsanctioned, but they sanctioned it anyway, you know.

13:16.955 --> 13:20.161
And then I got to go on the trip, and I got to beat the Russians.

13:20.222 --> 13:21.825
Where'd y'all go in Russia?

13:21.845 --> 13:23.208
We went to Kiev in 65.

13:24.110 --> 13:26.575
That was because Vietnam War was going on.

13:26.774 --> 13:30.882
The Russians didn't want to have it, but the agreement was that it's in the U.S.

13:31.002 --> 13:32.665
one year, Russia the next.

13:33.446 --> 13:40.399
And the agreement was that if anybody ever canceled, then that was the end of the series.

13:41.361 --> 13:44.226
So the Russians moved it to Kiev.

13:44.662 --> 13:45.963
and didn't publicize it all.

13:45.983 --> 13:52.510
It's the only time, because we didn't have college athletes on the team, it's the only time the combined men and women scored that the Russians defeated the U.S.

13:52.530 --> 13:53.932
team in the dual meet.

13:53.952 --> 13:58.056
And they couldn't even publicize it in Russia.

13:58.256 --> 14:01.640
And it was a... What was your impression of Russia at that time?

14:02.020 --> 14:04.203
Well, Kiev was much different than Moscow.

14:04.223 --> 14:05.044
I'd been to Moscow.

14:05.364 --> 14:05.824
Oh, you had?

14:06.345 --> 14:09.268
In 63, out of high school.

14:09.248 --> 14:16.317
And, you know, we went from Russia to Poland, Germany to England was our normal trip.

14:16.337 --> 14:17.838
We spent a week in Russia.

14:17.939 --> 14:23.686
And, you know, in those days, the Russian people looked at us like we were something from outer space.

14:24.467 --> 14:28.411
The kids would come up, and they didn't have gum, and we carried a lot of gum to give to the kids.

14:28.471 --> 14:33.838
And they'd come up, and the mothers would take it out of their hands and throw it down and grab their kids and pull them away from us.

14:34.713 --> 14:36.435
heard we were some kind of devils, you know.

14:37.316 --> 14:43.084
And a big part of the stadium that day was there was about 50 or 60,000 people, but a lot of them were Russian soldiers.

14:43.104 --> 14:48.370
So it was not a friendly environment for us.

14:48.390 --> 14:52.015
But they really lacked strength in Russia and power.

14:53.056 --> 14:56.080
So instead of everybody being excited about the 100 meters

14:56.431 --> 15:01.236
and things like that, they liked the 10,000 meters and they liked the shot put in the discus.

15:01.797 --> 15:07.503
Well, the shot, I was the world record holder, they put it out in the middle of the field.

15:07.523 --> 15:09.145
And stopped everything.

15:10.146 --> 15:14.732
But I'm out there warming up and I'm used to hearing Giggo Maggie.

15:14.832 --> 15:18.175
Every stadium I'd ever competed in, I'd hear Giggo Maggie.

15:18.195 --> 15:20.738
So I'm waiting for it.

15:20.758 --> 15:25.003
Well, we're in Kiev, they moved it out of Moscow, it's 1965.

15:25.642 --> 15:27.225
So I warm up and I don't hear it.

15:27.625 --> 15:31.733
And I told myself, this is the first time I'm not going to hear some Aggie holler and gig them Aggie.

15:32.694 --> 15:35.600
So I just accept that there's not an Aggie there.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.621
Finally found a place.

15:36.721 --> 15:39.887
It's kind of nice to know that maybe I could go somewhere to get away from them.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.384
I get in the ring for my first throw, you could hear a pin drop in the stadium.

15:44.424 --> 15:47.688
Halfway across I hear somebody yells, Gig'em, Aggie.

15:47.708 --> 15:48.889
Shot slips out of my hand.

15:49.069 --> 15:50.450
Went about 35 feet.

15:50.651 --> 15:58.298
Here I am, the big world record holder, and I got 50,000 Russians whistling at me, which is what they do when they disapprove.

15:58.318 --> 15:59.760
And that was embarrassing.

16:00.200 --> 16:07.107
And the next throw I threw 67 and easily won the meet and got things back together.

16:07.441 --> 16:09.784
And I said, that's one Aggie I'd like to run into.

16:10.085 --> 16:11.587
Well, I waited around, didn't see him.

16:12.568 --> 16:22.162
Years later, I'm sitting in my office, Association of Former Students, and I'm in a meeting, and the receptionist buzzes in and says, there's a man here who'd like to say hello.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.824
And I said, well, I'm in a meeting, you know, can't do it.

16:23.844 --> 16:25.787
And he said, well, he said, you wouldn't know him.

16:25.827 --> 16:27.990
He was in Kiev, Russia.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.092
I said, stop, wait a minute.

16:29.132 --> 16:30.274
Don't want to see him.

16:30.294 --> 16:33.398
I said, I've been looking for you for all these years because, you know, you got me.

16:33.935 --> 16:38.948
Embarrassed me in the middle of the stadium and he had worked with the State Department and he'd been on special assignment at Kiev.

16:38.988 --> 16:39.590
He's an Aggie.

16:40.472 --> 16:43.139
And I thought that was interesting.

16:43.159 --> 16:45.666
We finally met.

16:45.983 --> 16:54.799
So I never competed in a stadium anywhere that I know of, maybe in northern Sweden, that somebody didn't holler Gigam Aggie at me.

16:54.819 --> 17:05.038
Now, food and drink when you were in places like Kiev and Moscow, how did y'all... Well, they were real careful about that because they tried to keep us

17:05.018 --> 17:23.261
you know from getting sick and in those days in Russia and you'd get sick you know and you couldn't drink milk couldn't drink the water mostly had boiled meat and potatoes and most of us lost the the big guys lost 10 or 12 pounds in that week we were there and most of them got half of us got sick.

17:23.582 --> 17:25.304
What liquids did you all drink?

17:25.324 --> 17:30.250
They had kind of a mineral water tastes kind of like some of the

17:30.837 --> 17:33.646
So it was a bottle?

17:33.786 --> 17:34.288
A bottle.

17:35.412 --> 17:39.605
But some of the guys forgot and brushed their teeth with the other stuff and got sick.

17:39.665 --> 17:42.334
But we'd usually lose weight.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.661
Then we'd fly to Poland.

17:45.822 --> 17:49.490
Warsaw and it was like different than night and day.

17:49.530 --> 18:00.474
The people were treated us warmly and glad to see us and they didn't like the Russians and so it was a different experience for us going in there and it was like night and day.

18:01.256 --> 18:05.164
It was just a more open society compared to Russia in those days.

18:05.600 --> 18:12.947
and the food was better, and we'd go out and start going to restaurants and stuff then, but didn't go out and do much in Russia.

18:14.409 --> 18:21.616
And of all the international meets you ever did, what was your favorite and your least favorite place?

18:21.816 --> 18:26.541
Place.

18:26.581 --> 18:26.962
Yeah.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.684
You know, where was the most fun and where was it the least?

18:29.724 --> 18:32.367
I enjoyed...

18:33.933 --> 18:36.872
I enjoyed that time in Sweden and those little towns.

18:37.780 --> 18:47.710
But I have to say the most memorable one was the first time I went to Germany when 50,000 people came down out of the stands and it took them an hour to get us out of the stadium.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.153
The German athletes grabbed our hands and we marched through the crowd.

18:51.193 --> 18:52.034
It was a good meet.

18:52.074 --> 18:53.696
They gave us a good run for our money.

18:54.256 --> 19:05.307
We had some guys like Bob Hayes and Bob Segrin and Ralph Boston and some guys like that that were really good athletes and they gave us a good competition but the crowd

19:06.215 --> 19:10.642
was so appreciative and it reminded me of one of those German rallies during the war.

19:10.722 --> 19:17.574
They were chanting USA, you know, 50,000 people and it put goosebumps on you and it took a while to even get the buses out of the stadium.

19:18.695 --> 19:25.487
And that left an impression on me of the difference in track and field there than it is in this country.

19:26.088 --> 19:29.653
And I enjoyed those kind of plays.

19:29.734 --> 19:32.458
I guess London would have been my least favorite because I had

19:33.012 --> 19:39.202
I was a flag bearer in an international meet in London and brought the U.S.

19:39.242 --> 19:47.314
flag in and of course we do not dip our flag to other countries and other countries dip theirs and the crowd got on me.

19:47.334 --> 19:50.760
Ralph Boston who was a long jumper standing next to me and he started scooting away from me.

19:51.220 --> 19:54.145
It was just a little entourage of us and I said, where are you going?

19:54.165 --> 20:00.775
He said, they're going to start throwing stuff at us and I don't want to get hit.

20:02.307 --> 20:15.118
And Russia was not an enjoyable experience, but it was for somebody to get to go to a place like Russia in those days.

20:15.723 --> 20:20.692
was a good experience and one I, you know, value, but for competing it was not a good place.

20:21.073 --> 20:25.240
And did you ever compete before, say, a hostile crowd, mean crowd?

20:25.581 --> 20:26.041
Not really.

20:26.502 --> 20:26.663
Okay.

20:26.723 --> 20:27.103
Not really.

20:27.825 --> 20:32.533
They appreciated good performances and

20:33.222 --> 20:37.728
And track and field was the kind of sport that you didn't really run into that.

20:38.689 --> 20:40.972
As I said, London probably liked Americans at least.

20:41.593 --> 20:53.730
We ran into it in the Scandinavian countries a little bit, in Finland, not in, excuse me, not in Finland, Norway, some anti-Vietnam stuff in those days, burning the flag and hollering stuff like that at us.

20:54.851 --> 20:59.958
Mostly not in the stadium itself, but in other places when they see the U.S.

20:59.978 --> 21:00.198
team.

21:00.639 --> 21:01.440
Do you remember any...

21:01.707 --> 21:15.784
any place where you and by yourself were with some friends in some one of those foreign places and you ended up not being able to speak their language and suddenly you're cut off from everything?

21:15.824 --> 21:30.702
Well one time, the first time I went, you know, was right out of high school and I was talked into going, one of the older guys,

21:32.251 --> 21:35.135
who's a guy named Jim Beatty, who became a U.S.

21:35.195 --> 21:45.671
congressman, was a distance runner, a good American miler, took me kind of under his wing and we got off somewhere at night and couldn't get back.

21:45.812 --> 21:50.218
And in those days in Russia, only some younger children could speak English.

21:50.258 --> 21:53.103
They were just starting to take it in school a little bit and older people couldn't.

21:53.684 --> 21:57.229
And in Russia in those days, you didn't go get a cab on every corner or get a bus.

21:57.800 --> 22:03.433
And I don't remember how we ever got back to the hotel, but it took a while and it was late at night.

22:04.635 --> 22:12.653
And after that I stayed pretty close inside of the rest of the team because, you know, I was,

22:13.358 --> 22:21.947
18 years old then and I was, you know, this was all, I'd hardly been out of Texas and ended up in Moscow, Russia.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.091
And nobody ever tried to hold you up, steal anything?

22:26.131 --> 22:28.874
Never had any problem like that.

22:28.894 --> 22:29.674
And autographs?

22:30.395 --> 22:38.643
Autographs was a big deal and you had to, you know, I always felt kind of honored that somebody would want one so I tried to honor that.

22:39.184 --> 22:42.167
The only time I guess I feel a little guilty was in Tokyo

22:42.620 --> 22:46.686
After the shot put, after we were coming out of the stadium, Dallas Long and I were together.

22:48.308 --> 22:51.313
There was 100,000 people in that stadium in Tokyo.

22:52.254 --> 22:56.360
And we were trying to find the bus to get back to the village.

22:58.142 --> 23:05.573
And we turned around and here comes several hundred people running with autographs.

23:06.076 --> 23:07.903
and we'd turn around and ran for the bus.

23:08.083 --> 23:17.959
I always felt kind of guilty about that, but the bus would have left us, because they weren't about to wait on us, and you had to kind of do that, but most of the time,

23:18.462 --> 23:23.709
That was the kind of thing that you tried to, at least I did, tried to honor.

23:23.849 --> 23:26.854
And in Tokyo, you were not long out of high school.

23:27.314 --> 23:28.276
You finished second.

23:28.436 --> 23:30.278
Dallas Long won.

23:30.919 --> 23:37.849
Did he have anything to say to you in finishing him first and him second?

23:38.049 --> 23:47.322
All he said, and I threw well there and challenged him a little bit, even though he deserved to win.

23:47.302 --> 23:49.587
But he said to me, well, it's all yours now.

23:50.629 --> 23:52.152
And he didn't throw again after that.

23:52.453 --> 23:55.399
I kept hearing rumors every couple of years he was going to make a comeback.

23:56.582 --> 24:01.412
And that would have been a serious challenge because he was an unbelievable, strong,

24:02.084 --> 24:06.613
shot putter and carried himself in a way that I admired a great deal.

24:07.334 --> 24:21.561
During the time that you were throwing the shot, if you had been a coach of a young man, which of your competitors would you have identified as kind of a role model?

24:22.435 --> 24:26.245
In other words, I'm asking you, which of your competitors for which did you have?

24:26.266 --> 24:38.098
Well, Dallas Long would have been one because early on I saw that most of them were fretting around before the competition and looking nervous or something and Long had a look on him like,

24:39.040 --> 24:40.843
What did I have to be nervous about?

24:40.923 --> 24:41.384
I'm supposed to.

24:41.404 --> 24:42.426
He never said anything.

24:42.466 --> 24:45.251
He just had an air about him that he said over there very relaxed.

24:45.311 --> 24:47.314
And I remember we had a big meet one time.

24:47.354 --> 24:50.440
I look over there and everybody's stretching, warming up, getting a little nervous.

24:50.460 --> 24:53.545
And he's over there reading the program, chewing on a piece of grass.

24:53.565 --> 24:57.031
And I said, you know, he acts like he's supposed to do well.

24:57.352 --> 24:58.854
And I tried to emulate it.

24:58.894 --> 25:03.242
Not that I tried to copy him exactly, but to me I was most comfortable doing that.

25:03.222 --> 25:13.956
Not getting out there, getting some kind of external or internal psychology to get me all pumped up and like a lot of them do now, yelling and hollering.

25:13.976 --> 25:14.657
We wouldn't do that.

25:14.757 --> 25:16.499
If he threw well, he was supposed to throw well.

25:16.539 --> 25:17.761
He didn't jump up and down about it.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.143
That's what I was supposed to do.

25:19.263 --> 25:20.905
I was supposed to break the record on that throw.

25:20.965 --> 25:21.766
You might smile.

25:21.966 --> 25:22.827
That was it.

25:23.408 --> 25:24.910
And it's different today.

25:24.890 --> 25:31.779
What would describe the routine that you followed in your later years?

25:31.820 --> 25:34.483
In other words, you're up there and you're recognized.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.927
What was your routine at a meet?

25:37.427 --> 25:39.310
Let's say you get there a day or two in advance.

25:39.350 --> 25:40.992
What did you do when and all of them?

25:41.333 --> 25:49.924
I tried to get there late because I didn't want to fraternize with the enemy, so to speak, that much, except with Maggard I'd get there a little early.

25:50.285 --> 25:54.070
But usually in later years I was out of school or

25:54.370 --> 26:05.883
busier when I was in school and most of the big meets were in California or somewhere else so I'd come in late the night before and try to get out as soon as I could afterwards and not spend any more time there than I did.

26:05.923 --> 26:08.046
So you didn't work out on the track?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.387
I very seldom trained there.

26:09.528 --> 26:12.731
At Olympic trials I'd go out a few days early to get used to it.

26:13.532 --> 26:15.274
In 1972 that was a mistake.

26:15.294 --> 26:20.260
I would have done better if I had stayed home and came in late and I would have made the team probably.

26:20.577 --> 26:22.901
In times past, it helped me being out there.

26:23.502 --> 26:25.866
But normally I came in late and stayed to myself.

26:25.886 --> 26:27.969
What time would you go to bed the night before?

26:28.190 --> 26:30.193
Oh, about, depending on the time of the meet.

26:30.213 --> 26:37.445
I don't want to try to go to bed too early, but I'd go to bed at 10 or 11 o'clock and get up and try to have a normal routine the next day.

26:37.665 --> 26:40.791
I disliked night meets because of that, because it made the day too long.

26:40.951 --> 26:42.834
I like throwing it at 1 or 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

26:43.315 --> 26:43.916
All right.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.859
I'm going to take a little break here.

26:45.839 --> 26:48.526
All right, then let's say it's an afternoon meet.

26:49.629 --> 26:50.492
What time would you get up?

26:50.532 --> 26:51.214
What would you eat?

26:51.274 --> 26:52.377
What would you do that morning?

26:52.778 --> 26:58.313
Go through the whole... I tried not to get it where I had a ritual.

26:58.883 --> 27:23.878
because sometimes you couldn't stay with that ritual you know circumstances would change it so it was not anything sometimes I might have oatmeal for breakfast sometimes I'd have bacon and eggs and if it was a one o'clock meet sometimes I just wait and eat once at 10 o'clock you know and I tried not to get caught in a rut where I had to do it a certain way and I learned that a little bit when I was watching Jim Ryan in his early days

27:24.550 --> 27:46.491
eat a hot dog an hour and a half before he ran 351 for a world record a mile and I said you know he ain't worrying about if he ain't worrying about it I shouldn't be worrying about it too much you know I think that was one of those things that could get yourself in a rut and and and you spend too much time but you know well I didn't get to do it just like that so I'm not going to do well so I didn't I didn't have a set routine

27:47.095 --> 27:49.438
If I was doing well, I might approach it one way.

27:49.498 --> 27:51.460
If I wasn't doing well, I might approach it another.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.143
Sometimes I'd sit around and visit with people down in the lobby.

27:54.644 --> 27:56.586
Other times, I had nothing to do with anybody.

27:56.606 --> 27:57.387
I stayed in my room.

27:57.427 --> 28:00.891
It just depended on kind of where I was at and what I was trying to do.

28:01.532 --> 28:04.495
Was the food worldwide reasonably standard?

28:06.418 --> 28:08.240
Yeah.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.923
When you're with a team, they've made an effort to do that, yeah.

28:11.864 --> 28:16.309
Like the Olympics, you have your own cooks and everything, your own food brought in.

28:16.711 --> 28:19.294
But when you travel on your own, you adjust.

28:19.314 --> 28:21.473
But you know, I wanted to kind of enjoy the

28:22.347 --> 28:28.513
You know, when in Germany, you do like the Germans, you know, eat Wienerschnitzel or something, you know.

28:28.573 --> 28:31.897
But I never did worry about that.

28:31.957 --> 28:35.441
Like maybe somebody running at 10,000 meters might have to worry about a little more.

28:36.181 --> 28:48.474
And did you, in those times when you were doing the circuit, was there anything that you always had with you, any watch or ring or ribbon or anything?

28:48.494 --> 28:48.554
No.

28:49.075 --> 28:49.896
You didn't?

28:49.916 --> 28:52.118
I tried to have the same shot put all the time.

28:52.098 --> 28:55.326
that I knew exactly what it weighed and what it felt like.

28:55.807 --> 29:00.058
In some international meets, Olympics, they wouldn't let you use yours.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.284
Some meets in the U.S., they'd try not to.

29:03.567 --> 29:06.073
The problem with international, they used to aggravate me.

29:06.577 --> 29:17.109
is that in international rules, if your shot weighs in and is legal, you can use it, but you have to make it available to all the other competitors.

29:17.169 --> 29:20.913
And the Russians used to want to get our shots and throw them just to aggravate us.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.676
And that would aggravate me.

29:24.817 --> 29:25.638
And I didn't like it.

29:26.179 --> 29:28.401
But that was one of the things I didn't like.

29:28.441 --> 29:30.623
I liked to keep it with me, carry it around, hold it.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.867
Now, when you went on the plane, where did the shot go?

29:33.847 --> 29:37.893
I carried it on the plane in a bowling bag.

29:37.953 --> 29:39.775
Now they've got special bags for them.

29:39.795 --> 29:43.901
In the latter years it got to be a little problem when they started really checking stuff like that.

29:44.041 --> 29:48.608
A few times they took it from me and put it in the cockpit or somewhere.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.350
Did it ever get lost or stolen?

29:51.472 --> 29:56.158
I lost a shot in Italy.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.550
I don't know, coming back on an overseas flight, they wouldn't let me carry it on.

30:02.570 --> 30:04.493
I didn't mind checking it because that was the end of the season.

30:05.614 --> 30:12.141
And it arrived in College Station about six months later.

30:12.702 --> 30:15.305
I actually had to go down to the customs in Houston and pick it up.

30:15.986 --> 30:17.447
I'd written it off.

30:17.467 --> 30:20.271
Now, are there any shots that you have kept?

30:21.392 --> 30:25.977
Well, I had one that I did that I was fond of.

30:27.256 --> 30:33.130
In a weak moment I gave it to the Texas Sports Hall of Fame and they have it on location over there.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.696
And they do have it displayed again.

30:35.756 --> 30:38.322
For a while it went back in storage when the thing went bankrupt.

30:38.402 --> 30:40.066
It's in Waco now.

30:40.287 --> 30:42.953
Which one was that for you?

30:44.418 --> 30:50.606
That was a shot that I brought from high school, that 16-pound shot, and I had a hole drilled.

30:50.646 --> 30:51.867
At one time, it got a little light.

30:51.887 --> 30:58.876
It had just worn down, and I tried to keep it just barely over, but enough that it always passed the scales if they weren't exact.

30:59.697 --> 31:07.767
And I remember I took it over, and there was somebody here in town that drilled a hole in it and put some lead in it just to get the weight back up a little bit over.

31:08.467 --> 31:12.973
Now, normally a shot is made of cast iron or what?

31:13.156 --> 31:21.546
Generally they were made of cast iron in the early days and molded together a lot of times and by 19...
