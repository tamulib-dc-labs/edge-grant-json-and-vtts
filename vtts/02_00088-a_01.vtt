WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:03.013
That first fall? I don't think any of our family 
came down here to visit. Both his family and my

00:08.820 --> 00:12.425
family had been here various times. When I came to 
visit the campus in the years, in the previous

00:12.785 --> 00:18.733
years, my mother had brought, had come down here 
with me. In fact, I stayed at the MSC with my mother

00:19.234 --> 00:24.200
for one of the dances that I came down. I did come 
down for one of the, at least one of the dances,

00:24.220 --> 00:28.806
maybe two. and his parents came down at least one 
time and for a football game and for final review,

00:29.444 --> 00:39.376
we all came down and saw the final review. Then when 
did y'all go, did y'all go home for Thanksgiving?

00:44.964 --> 00:45.544
Yes, we did. The game, and if I remember correctly 
that, because I know that we came back shortly and

00:45.584 --> 00:56.498
lived here, but I believe we won the game No, the 
thing was we lost the game, but we played well and we

00:57.271 --> 01:03.281
got the Monday off. I think that was it. We lost, but 
we played well and we got the Monday off. Then you

01:13.036 --> 01:16.121
went home for Christmas. Yes. And then came back, 
studied for finals. That's right, we did. It was

01:21.419 --> 01:25.363
the whole year was different than it is now. Was 
there a kind of a

01:26.323 --> 01:33.350
support mechanism, system? Was there anybody? 
Where did you turn if you wanted to learn more about

01:34.370 --> 01:39.755
this course or to prepare for it? Who did you go to 
for advice? Actually, I think basically I relied

01:42.638 --> 01:49.924
on my husband because he had been here for four 
years before that. He had been active not only in

01:50.360 --> 01:53.263
the Corps. He'd spent four years in the Corps even 
though he didn't have a contract. The vet students

01:56.887 --> 02:00.871
couldn't have a contract because they went to 
school in the summer. And he was one of the ones that

02:00.891 --> 02:06.497
entered vet school after two years of pre-vet. Not 
all of them were able to do that. But he had also been

02:12.383 --> 02:17.228
active on campus and served on the MSC Council. and 
as a class officer. And so whenever I needed

02:19.951 --> 02:24.618
advice, I pretty much just turned to him. And so you 
said that nine hours you did well in two and not as

02:26.120 --> 02:32.450
well in the other. What about the second semester? 
The second semester, because I'd done well in

02:34.373 --> 02:44.970
history, I went and got special permission to take 
an upper division history class. the second

02:45.170 --> 02:55.258
American history class and an upper division 
world history class, early class. I think it ended

02:55.579 --> 03:03.685
at 500, Greek or Roman here, and a math class. And

03:04.506 --> 03:09.110
so I still took nine hours. I had decided to get a job 
and I found a job When I realized how little I was

03:15.595 --> 03:29.217
making, because I had worked the year before when I 
was a senior in high school, I eventually gave up my

03:15.595 --> 03:29.217
job because it just didn't seem like it was worth 
the money that I was bringing. I think I was earning

03:29.277 --> 03:35.207
60 cents an hour or something like that, but I had 
decided that that that's really what I wanted. And

03:36.689 --> 03:40.973
by that time, I knew that we were leaving as soon as 
he graduated in August. Okay. You remained in

03:42.795 --> 03:44.917
Hensel the whole year. Yes. Did you ever witness 
any student pranks, Good Bull, any of the?

03:57.670 --> 04:04.637
You know, I probably didn't see anything like 
that. My experiences dealing with the students,

04:05.005 --> 04:28.617
Hensel didn't have that, I mean we didn't have 
that, but my experiences dealing with student

04:05.005 --> 04:28.617
events really when I decided to run for freshman 
class early in the semester, I guess in September,

04:30.554 --> 04:31.455
Yes, September. Yeah, describe that. Okay. Well, 
since my husband had been an officer and I thought,

04:33.958 --> 04:44.712
well, A&M's opening up and having females, they 
might as well have a female run for office. And I had

04:45.332 --> 04:52.862
been active in high school and done things, and so I 
decided to run for social secretary. I figured

04:52.922 --> 04:56.967
that that would be something that a female might be 
capable of doing and I filed the papers and nobody

04:57.436 --> 05:10.268
ever said anything and my husband said, I know what 
you do, how you run for office and we'll take care of

04:57.436 --> 05:10.268
this. And generally what he, the first time we were 
going to go and we were going to, I was going to talk

05:11.109 --> 05:25.603
to some of the freshmen so he went to the dorm And he 
told the, I guess, the duty officer of the day that

05:25.988 --> 05:35.299
he had someone to speak to the freshmen for a 
freshman class office. And this is, I assume, the

05:35.319 --> 05:37.461
way it was done. And then the duty officer would get 
all the freshmen in the dorm together and, of

05:37.501 --> 05:48.734
course, he didn't tell them that it was a female 
that was going to speak to them. And we went to

05:49.615 --> 05:55.742
several different dorms and I had a, not a prepared 
speech, but I introduced myself, told them where I

05:56.077 --> 06:04.052
was from, what I'd done, and I was rather dressed 
up. I remember I had on heels that night. We did this

06:08.260 --> 06:17.196
several times, and we had a discussion about 
whether he was going to tell them that it was a

06:08.260 --> 06:17.196
female or whether he wasn't going to tell them it 
was a female. In one particular dorm, He, of

06:19.837 --> 06:27.624
course, he had said, I think it's better, we'll get 
a better turnout, although they're going to make

06:19.837 --> 06:27.624
the freshmen come anyway. But one of the times, 
sometimes it was very crowded and I couldn't see

06:30.027 --> 06:38.595
very many of the students other than the ones that 
were just in the front. In one particular dorm, it

06:39.315 --> 06:44.480
was the area was larger. And I was standing there 
and I'm beginning to see the freshmen file in. and

06:50.093 --> 07:10.009
then it was getting crowded and but I could still 
see what was happening and all of a sudden I noticed

06:50.093 --> 07:10.009
that there were two young men who had towels on and I 
assumed that was all that they had on and when they

06:50.093 --> 07:10.009
realized that there was a female standing in front 
then they kind of were inching over so that they

07:10.394 --> 07:15.720
were behind other people in the dorm. And after 
that happened, I said, you tell them that this is

07:15.740 --> 07:24.530
going to be a female because, you know, this is 
embarrassing for them and for me. But nobody ever

07:25.090 --> 07:29.195
said anything to me. Nobody said, you shouldn't be 
doing this. We had our election and I was not

07:34.041 --> 07:39.827
elected.

07:40.077 --> 07:43.883
ended up coming in towards the end. I don't even 
remember. I'd have to read the articles again. The

07:46.127 --> 07:49.233
paper called me a Maggie. They didn't call me an 
Aggie because they hadn't decided whether we

07:49.413 --> 07:53.279
could be Aggies or not. The one thing I do remember 
is that one of the other officers that was elected

07:53.320 --> 07:59.470
that during that election was Henry Cisneros 
because he was in that class. I don't believe I ever

08:04.772 --> 08:08.657
met him, but he was. That class had a number of very 
bright Hispanics because A&M had gone out to

08:09.358 --> 08:20.013
recruit, not with a shotgun but with a rifle, that 
one, that one, that one, and that one. And then as

08:20.033 --> 08:21.795
seniors they almost took over the campus.

08:27.003 --> 08:34.814
Hector Gutierrez was the first corps commander, 
Henry I think was band commander or something like

08:27.003 --> 08:34.814
that, over and over and over. Did you put out any 
signs, campaign posters? I don't remember that we

08:40.663 --> 08:42.866
did that. If we did it, it was low key, it was not We 
might have put things on some of the bulletin

08:47.594 --> 08:56.284
boards, but we didn't put things on the ground or in 
stakes or anything like that. Did you have a

08:57.665 --> 08:58.867
campaign slogan? No, I didn't. I just said that I 
pretty much told everybody that since I was, that I

09:00.548 --> 09:16.386
thought that a woman could handle the office of 
social secretary for the class, and I just

09:00.548 --> 09:16.386
explained some of the experience that I had 
earlier. Did anybody ever ask you a ridiculous

09:17.277 --> 09:22.123
question or an insulting question from an 
audience? No, I think most of the audience were so

09:22.143 --> 09:34.198
stunned when they saw me and I would say, I'd ask at 
the end of my presentation if anybody had any

09:22.143 --> 09:34.198
questions. I remember being asked just one or two 
times different things, you know, if I'd

09:34.218 --> 09:42.728
forgotten to where are you from or, you know, 
things like that. But I think these freshmen were

09:42.708 --> 09:53.124
just so stunned that they were coming down to 
listen to a female, not in a bad sense, but just it

09:42.708 --> 09:53.124
was a surprise. Now, were the comparatively small 
number of co-eds in your classes and so forth, did

09:54.005 --> 10:02.839
you feel lonely, lonesome? I think that I was 
brought up in a way that it prevented me from having

10:12.188 --> 10:13.289
that feeling. I could be friends with the guys and I 
know there were times when we would go have coffee

10:15.031 --> 10:24.461
together, some of the ones that were in my classes. 
We'd go have coffee at the MSC occasionally and

10:24.841 --> 10:31.208
talk. And I think that the way I was raised 
contributed to that. My mother had a a BBA degree

10:38.699 --> 11:05.500
from the University of Texas so she was probably 
one of very few women in her program and because she

10:38.699 --> 11:05.500
was in business and I had been raised to speak to 
adults and I never had any problem and I always I

10:38.699 --> 11:05.500
mean I was equal to them so I never had any problem 
and I have friends I'd always had male friends

11:06.037 --> 11:07.560
even. I mean in high school I had male friends. 
Right now I'm going to ask you a dumb, stupid, naive

11:10.807 --> 11:13.854
question. Was your Jewish background in fact a 
strength to you for this? That might have been

11:22.232 --> 11:25.058
true. I'm saying about being an individual, being 
self-reliant. Right. And I will make a comment. My

11:31.111 --> 11:41.001
husband had said one time that being an Aggie was 
kind of like being Jewish because you, at that

11:31.111 --> 11:41.001
time, we were, you know, the Aggies were 
minorities. They were, when you got together,

11:41.041 --> 11:45.826
people were always kind of, oh, an Aggie. I mean, 
not that they would do that as a Jew, but you just

11:46.246 --> 11:50.831
felt different if you were an Aggie. And so that's 
possibly the way it was. The other thing was that I

11:54.721 --> 12:19.429
think that because my mother had a college 
education, which might have been because she was

11:54.721 --> 12:19.429
Jewish, although there were plenty of Jewish 
women who didn't, but a lot of them did, it made it

11:54.721 --> 12:19.429
easy for me to be in an academic setting and that I 
always felt equal to any situation. You're

12:19.561 --> 12:26.259
here only a year at that point. I'm looking for 
questions. You mentioned Henry Cisneros. Were

12:31.953 --> 12:36.405
there any other celebrities, people who became 
so, that you remember? I don't remember anybody

12:36.959 --> 12:38.641
else. Did you meet Henry that year? It's possible 
that I did. I don't remember. I think I might have

12:43.688 --> 12:50.136
because we had some meetings of the ones that were 
going to run for office. So I believe that we did

12:50.196 --> 12:52.018
meet each other. I was looking at your questions 
and I don't know whether you want me to go ahead.

12:58.166 --> 12:58.526
Yeah, please do. You asked about the campus 
hospital and that year, this goes back to whether

12:58.547 --> 13:06.797
they expect women or not. That year there was an 
outbreak and I want to say maybe hepatitis at San

13:07.064 --> 13:18.540
Houston State or over in Huntsville, I believe. 
But wherever it was and whatever the

13:19.902 --> 13:30.717
disease, they had asked all of the students to get 
vaccinated. Or actually, it might have been a

13:31.358 --> 13:34.422
gamma-globin shot. and so they asked us to go to the 
hospital and I remember the old hospital I think

13:34.807 --> 13:52.917
I'm remembering right it had an open double doors 
and there was kind of a foyer in the front and we were

13:53.150 --> 13:57.215
out the door, down the block, there was a long line 
of us. And there, I don't, I didn't remember seeing

13:57.996 --> 14:02.021
any other females in that line. But I had gotten in 
the line, I think my mom called and said, you go get

14:02.101 --> 14:05.164
it. So I got in line with all the other guys and the 
nurses were inside and they had not expected a

14:06.005 --> 14:13.915
female. And what they were doing was they were 
having the guys come through the door dropped

14:19.272 --> 14:22.075
their pants and they were giving them a shot right 
there. They weren't taking them to an examining

14:22.095 --> 14:23.957
room. And all of a sudden they realized that 
there's a female right there standing there. So

14:29.302 --> 14:47.220
they had to quickly, you know, stop what they were 
doing, escort me to a different room, and then I

14:29.302 --> 14:47.220
went out a back door so that I didn't disrupt this 
continual

14:29.302 --> 14:47.220
setup that they had arranged so that it was It was 
less time consuming. They could just, once they

14:48.952 --> 14:53.099
got them in the doors, they could give real shots 
and all. But that's another incident where they

14:53.119 --> 15:03.176
had not, things were still not in place for females 
or there were no contingencies for females. It was

15:03.236 --> 15:06.621
like the bathroom situation and where. Oh, yeah, 
where were there restroom facilities for women in

15:06.642 --> 15:14.254
the classroom buildings then? The things that I 
remember having to do was to go find the office,

15:15.128 --> 15:37.009
wherever the office was in that building, and 
specifically I remember Nagel Hall, and having to

15:15.128 --> 15:37.009
then go to the secretaries, and generally the 
female, the restrooms were locked, they weren't

15:15.128 --> 15:37.009
marked, and you had to have a key. And so the 
secretary would then walk you down the hall,

15:37.690 --> 15:43.836
unlock the door, and show you where where the 
bathrooms were. I do remember that specifically

15:45.655 --> 15:50.142
in Nagel. I don't remember, I know that I was in, I 
had a class in the academic building and in animal

15:50.402 --> 15:57.854
industries. I don't remember looking in those 
other two buildings, but generally that was what

15:58.555 --> 16:03.742
you had to do. Now, in most of your classes, both 
semesters, how many women were there in the class?

16:08.930 --> 16:12.135
When I took the upper level history class, there 
were a few other women in that class. I'm assuming

16:15.420 --> 16:40.553
that most of the women who came here that year had 
been going to Sam or someplace like that and when

16:15.420 --> 16:40.553
A&M opened up they didn't have to travel anymore 
and that these were a little bit older than I am and

16:15.420 --> 16:40.553
because I was so young, I was only 18, there were 
very few married 18-year-olds and so I didn't have

16:41.326 --> 16:46.391
any in my classes except that. And the only bad 
situation I had, had to do with that kind of

16:47.372 --> 16:53.437
situation. And do you have any guess as to what 
percentage of the undergraduate women were

16:54.438 --> 17:09.392
married and were single?

17:09.592 --> 17:20.535
Since I didn't meet very many of them, it's only a 
guess, but I would think that the majority of these

17:09.592 --> 17:20.535
were not the daughters of the faculty member. They 
were student wives. Student wives, yes. that were

17:25.673 --> 17:27.575
living in Hensel. And I met some wives who were 
seniors at Sam and didn't want to transfer and were

17:27.895 --> 17:33.961
still commuting. So there were more married 
students, but they still continued to go to St.

17:34.522 --> 17:41.428
Houston. I see you got some other notes there. 
Well, I told you about going to the hospital. We

17:52.019 --> 17:55.562
also, I burned my hand and I ended up having to go 
over there. that was a different situation. They

17:57.446 --> 18:00.171
took care of me and it was early in the morning. I 
remember Guyon Hall and we attended plays there

18:01.393 --> 18:07.524
that the university put on. They would have calls 
for people who were interested and I was

18:07.604 --> 18:15.879
enthralled by the building. I thought it was a 
gorgeous building and it had they were kind of

18:18.475 --> 18:27.404
faded but it was red plush seats and actually my 
husband's graduation took place in Guyon Hall,

18:18.475 --> 18:27.404
the vet school's graduation took place in Guyon 
Hall. So I was, I had fond memories of Guyon Hall and

18:27.885 --> 18:36.293
when they announced that they were tearing it down 
I was saddened. One of the other things that we

18:36.934 --> 18:45.883
participated in was when, was as a student when you 
bought this packet of all the things that you were

18:36.934 --> 18:45.883
entitled to you got the I think it was called Town 
Hall Series, and we would see the presentations

18:46.117 --> 19:02.175
that they brought and put on in the

18:46.117 --> 19:02.175
basketball arena in G. Raleigh White. And I can't 
remember what his, he's the New Orleans

19:02.555 --> 19:08.242
trumpeter. Pete Fountain? No, it's the other, 
shoot, it's not Fountain, it's the big one. But he

19:16.070 --> 19:24.919
came and I remember, of course, it wasn't air 
conditioned and we were sitting way up at the top

19:16.070 --> 19:24.919
and the windows were open. But you could hear him 
way up there. But we did, I think that the students

19:28.243 --> 19:39.194
that wanted to had, did

19:28.243 --> 19:39.194
take advantage of those kind of things and 
traveling. Did you all go to any movies? If so,

19:41.676 --> 19:42.257
where? I do remember going to, Not to the theater, I 
mean not inside theaters here. We went to the

19:48.896 --> 19:51.339
drive-in a couple of times. Oh. We went to, and I 
also, and I also went to. The Grove? Yeah, I've been

19:55.824 --> 19:57.085
to the Grove. We would go to the Grove and take your 
mosquito repellent. But occasionally we went to

20:03.432 --> 20:07.097
the Grove for things in the spring or something. 
Did you go to the drive-in here at north side of the

20:07.117 --> 20:11.001
campus? I think it was off of Texas Avenue, but I'm 
not sure where it was. And one of the other things

20:15.880 --> 20:40.347
that we did was, that was kind of a splurge, was 
going, and we went one night when it was just

20:15.880 --> 20:40.347
freezing cold and had problems seeing the movie, 
you know, because of the, but we would put our

20:15.880 --> 20:40.347
nickels in a jar and when we'd have enough nickels, 
we would go around the corner from Hansel And I

20:40.732 --> 20:57.746
don't remember whether it was a kettle, but there 
was a little restaurant,

20:40.732 --> 20:57.746
and we would have pie and coffee at, say, 10 or 10.30 
at night, just at the end of the day, when we have

20:40.732 --> 20:57.746
enough extra nickels. Where did you do your 
grocery shopping? Piggly Wiggly, generally just

21:00.328 --> 21:10.637
across the street, which was over there, right 
close to Hensel. I would occasionally go into

21:11.073 --> 21:28.652
Bryan, and I can't remember what

21:11.073 --> 21:28.652
grocery store, but I watched the specials, and we 
could get five cans of tuna fish for a dollar, or

21:11.073 --> 21:28.652
three cans for a dollar. But a lot of times I just 
went over to Piggly Wiggly, which I believe was

21:30.154 --> 21:39.544
just right across Texas Avenue.

21:40.604 --> 21:47.194
Well, I think we've covered

21:40.604 --> 21:47.194
a lot of the things. I did say that I told you about 
the football games and

21:47.274 --> 22:09.548
one of the things, we went home to Shreveport 
probably once during the fall semester and then

21:47.274 --> 22:09.548
Thanksgiving and then a couple of times in the 
spring semester. And I know that I was scared silly

22:09.865 --> 22:23.200
when my husband decided to pick up a hitchhiker, 
but he was in his Aggie uniform, so he did, you know,

22:09.865 --> 22:23.200
we did. and that was all right. I was, when you 
talked about notable personalities on campus, I

22:25.242 --> 22:33.494
do remember Pinky Downs, but I also remember 
Ranger, and... Describe each of those. Well,

22:36.078 --> 22:38.662
Pinky Downs seemed to be everywhere. Whenever you 
went to an event, he was there, and the official

22:38.702 --> 22:52.123
greeter, I think, is what his title was, and 
whatever it was, if it was a dance or any kind of

22:38.702 --> 22:52.123
event on campus, He seemed to be there all the time. 
And it was strange to me, I was going, who is this

22:56.002 --> 22:59.607
guy, you know? I mean, I'd seen him before when I had 
been here, but the other notable person that we all

22:59.687 --> 23:08.500
knew, Ranger. And... Make believe I didn't know 
who Ranger was. Ranger was President Rutter's

23:12.625 --> 23:23.481
dog, and he was the ugliest bulldog you ever, I 
think he was a bulldog, but he was the ugliest dog

23:12.625 --> 23:23.481
you ever saw, and he had the run of the campus. I 
mean, Reveille was always, kept on a leash, but

23:26.123 --> 23:41.392
Ranger just roamed around and attended classes 
with students regularly, especially since all

23:26.123 --> 23:41.392
the classrooms were opened, or many of them were 
opened because the campus wasn't

23:26.123 --> 23:41.392
air-conditioned. And I know that when I had class 
in the Animal Industries building, he would I'm

23:46.981 --> 24:15.621
not sure exactly how he got in because there were 
steps to get into that building and into that room

23:46.981 --> 24:15.621
but he joined us in that building and I remember 
more than one time that he was in the classroom and

23:46.981 --> 24:15.621
everybody would pat him and I don't remember 
feeding him or anything but he certainly didn't

23:46.981 --> 24:15.621
look like he needed to be fed but he was a gentle 
member of the student body I guess you'd say, or an

24:16.073 --> 24:19.161
honored member. Did you go to Silver Taps? Yes, I 
attended Silver Taps. I cannot remember whether

24:23.752 --> 24:31.230
there was one specifically for anybody that we 
knew, but I did attend Silver Taps. I've recently

24:31.700 --> 24:34.946
attended another Silver Taps. I don't remember it 
being quite as long, the ceremony being quite as

24:35.446 --> 24:38.772
long. I don't remember. You mean then? It's longer 
now? I think it's longer now. But I could be, it

24:42.578 --> 24:47.126
could have been that my legs were tired this last 
time. And we attended Muster, and I'd already

24:47.186 --> 24:55.260
attended Muster before, but an entry for it. We 
attended Muster, it was held that year on the front

24:55.645 --> 25:06.318
lawn of the administration building and the 
student body sat out on the lawn there. And it was

25:06.839 --> 25:17.473
held, I believe it was still light, so I believe it 
was earlier perhaps than it is now. I think that's

25:17.493 --> 25:19.035
true. But we did have it right there, so it's not 
the, and it was, It was just as important as it is

25:25.835 --> 25:28.479
now. I think that it was a simpler service than it is 
now. And it's a very profound service. What about

25:42.040 --> 25:43.783
Bonfire? Did you go to Bonfire? I had attended at 
least one other Bonfire.

25:55.265 --> 25:57.729
I was, yes, we, I'm trying to remember the game. 
This was the year after Kennedy died, so the year

25:58.350 --> 26:04.620
before was when the bonfire didn't burn. And this 
year we did have bonfire, yes, and I was there.

26:11.110 --> 26:15.938
Because we didn't go home until later, and so I did 
attend. Keep going. Well, I think that we got to,

26:20.560 --> 26:36.176
I'm trying to see what else I can, after I've told 
you about Ranger and I'm glad that Ranger has a

26:20.560 --> 26:36.176
distinct spot on the campus because I thought he 
was, and the muster. That was, I've attended a lot

26:37.718 --> 26:44.124
of musters and that's one that stands out in my 
memory. I've attended a muster in London. But that

26:49.535 --> 26:54.962
one does stand out in,

26:49.535 --> 26:54.962
let's see. This question, describe the student 
body in general. As far as you at that point, Aggies

26:59.228 --> 27:04.095
came from where? Were they rural or urban? I think 
it was in flux actually. I believe that a lot of the,

27:08.881 --> 27:11.745
although most of the Jewish students were urban, 
of course, and there were no farm boys. The

27:18.236 --> 27:25.304
population in general was still beginning, was 
just beginning to start coming from the bigger

27:18.236 --> 27:25.304
cities. I, and the problem with this is that, with 
my answer to that question is that my mom was a Texan

27:27.366 --> 27:36.737
and I, I also had heard stories about what she said 
during the Depression about who attended A&M. But

27:44.869 --> 28:01.678
I primarily believe that a lot of them, they were 
beginning to leave, they would not be the farm

27:44.869 --> 28:01.678
boys, but there were still a lot of small town rural 
people and not the overwhelming majority of urban

28:01.895 --> 28:05.546
people, the students that there are now, which I 
know is true. You saw a Hispanic? Yes. As a matter of

28:07.633 --> 28:14.554
fact, my husband's best friend in that school was a 
Hispanic. they got to be friends because my

28:14.956 --> 28:43.596
husband's name was Goldman and his name was Garcia 
so they sat next to each other and in fact I had

28:14.956 --> 28:43.596
stayed at their house he was married and he was an 
older student who had been an undergraduate here

28:14.956 --> 28:43.596
earlier and had gone back to vet school as a little 
bit older student and so he and his wife taught

28:14.956 --> 28:43.596
school here and so yes I did see Hispanics on the 
campus And coming from the south, that was not

28:43.930 --> 28:49.455
unusual for me, although I didn't come from Texas. 
We had Hispanics in the school system, even though

28:50.576 --> 28:56.662
it was a segregated school system. Were there any 
blacks at A&M that fall? I don't believe so. I don't

29:00.445 --> 29:01.786
remember seeing any there. Were you aware of any 
Asian, either Asian American or Asian nationals?

29:13.327 --> 29:21.986
It seems to me that there might have been some Asian 
graduate students here already by then, and that

29:13.327 --> 29:21.986
we saw a few Asians here. And whether or not they 
were Asian Americans or whether they were

29:22.587 --> 29:31.487
non-natives, I don't really know, but I do 
remember seeing some, you know, around the campus

29:31.889 --> 29:35.895
in the library and things. And I'm assuming very 
few international students. Yeah, yeah. So

29:41.985 --> 29:46.452
that's why I wouldn't, I would guess that these 
were Asian Americans, but I don't know for sure. It

29:46.472 --> 29:48.274
could have been a few from. Let's see.

29:54.043 --> 29:59.892
Now, College View, those were the old World War II 
barrack-like. Right. And do you have any idea how

30:00.830 --> 30:08.159
extensive, how big, how many people were in 
College View, you reckon? I don't know because

30:08.179 --> 30:24.118
College View, since that was the, those were the 
ones that,

30:08.179 --> 30:24.118
that I said I wouldn't live in because they had 
fires in those since I was, Hensel was made out of

30:08.179 --> 30:24.118
cinder blocks and I figured it wasn't going to 
burn, so. Oh, I see. Hensel was over on? Hensel was

30:26.921 --> 30:30.465
north of the school and, East of the, of college. 
East of college, yeah. And College View was also,

30:35.430 --> 30:40.337
there were those, they were wooden barracks like. 
Now there were some other wooden housing for

30:40.397 --> 30:55.479
married graduate students that were over where

30:40.397 --> 30:55.479
the police station used to be and on the south side 
of the campus. But the vet students weren't

30:56.581 --> 30:59.625
considered graduate students. And we didn't 
qualify for that housing. And I don't know whether

31:03.340 --> 31:05.867
those were bigger or not. But I have an idea they 
might have been two bedrooms. But actually, the

31:09.596 --> 31:14.408
College View, the wooden barracks, I
