WEBVTT

00:04.216 --> 00:05.317
Where were we? Oh, the trees. And I said, well, I 
think it's $50 million, but I'll check on it. And I

00:16.532 --> 00:19.757
came back with a precise figure of the Forest 
Service right upstairs. And he said, I thought of

00:21.599 --> 00:30.411
all those millions of trees that we plant through 
the 4-H and FFA and commercially. He said, then I

00:30.431 --> 00:33.615
had just signed the... authorization to buy the, 
oh, I think it was 300 live oaks that were placed

00:34.760 --> 00:49.758
around the perimeter where we thought we were 
going to lose the big oaks, the dying of the

00:34.760 --> 00:49.758
live oak decline. And he said, here's the letter I 
proposed. Dear brother so-and-so, we plant more

00:55.825 --> 01:01.392
than we cut. And I think it's only fair to know that 
the enclosed letter was written by someone, and

01:02.907 --> 01:10.517
they signed your name at the bottom. Sincerely, 
Jack K. Williams.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.769
Here are some little things that I took notes on 
about him. On being president, I have had from

01:21.371 --> 01:31.024
friends notes of commiseration on my promotion, 
various expressions written and verbal which

01:31.645 --> 01:36.831
range in emotional scale from condolences to 
abject pity. He said, this job should be filled by a

01:39.294 --> 01:48.426
friendless orphan, a bachelor, one skilled in 
tightrope walking and bronco busting. And then on

01:49.848 --> 01:59.880
another occasion, the atmosphere of education is 
heady with the smell of change for some, perfume

01:49.848 --> 01:59.880
for others, brimstone. on campus riots, what 
would happen, Dr. Williams, if we had a riot?

02:06.522 --> 02:10.266
Police and strength will be called without 
hesitation. Those identified as leaders of

02:10.346 --> 02:22.497
felonious conduct and as inciters of a riot will be 
moved off campus, and the injunctive process will

02:10.346 --> 02:22.497
be applied to prevent their reentry. On former 
students, he counted among A&M's assets the

02:23.759 --> 02:28.483
legion of former students where fierce loyalty to 
this university is no less material than it is

02:29.105 --> 02:34.430
vocal. This being a formal way of saying that Aggie 
alumni put their dollars where their mouths are.

02:42.619 --> 02:45.702
And here are just some notes about him. He was a 
strong supporter of the Corps and that very few

02:45.722 --> 02:54.411
people knew of his experiences in the Marines and 
the Pacific Theater during the war. And he had a

02:55.692 --> 02:58.335
very positive attitude about the military. Had a 
marvelous influence on bringing new faculty of

02:59.615 --> 03:06.584
eminence and obtaining the funding to keep them. 
And he had the very innovative idea of using

03:08.286 --> 03:15.716
students in presentations at budget hearings. 
And that really was a step forward for us. Had a

03:21.864 --> 03:26.770
strong impact on grants and gifts from industry 
and endowed professorships. some of the

03:27.998 --> 03:38.173
significant accomplishments under him, the Sea 
Grant designation, and I had bringing Frank

03:27.998 --> 03:38.173
Wardlaw to plan and develop the A&M Press. His pet 
peeve was federal intervention in higher

03:40.276 --> 03:54.597
education, probes, reports, investigations, 
audits, surveys, visitation, and he referred to

03:40.276 --> 03:54.597
all of that as the web of entanglement. His 
personality, I mentioned they marched on the

03:56.618 --> 04:04.591
president's home when he came in and the resulting 
$5,000 grant from the Strait Foundation. You

04:05.232 --> 04:10.421
remember they came in and they marched on his home 
and welcomed him and that really struck him. He was

04:11.402 --> 04:12.804
warmly down to earth. One time holding and handing 
up fluorescent bulbs to a man on the ladder at his

04:14.066 --> 04:18.313
home. He told me one time, he said, Cooper, your 
hair is getting too long. He says, I'm going to If

04:25.188 --> 04:33.256
you let it get any longer, I'm going to hold you by 
the shoulders and let Dooley Bell cut your hair

04:25.188 --> 04:33.256
with his clippers. He loved to visit with elderly 
folks, and he milked them for their wisdom. One of

04:40.023 --> 04:49.693
the times he fussed at me, we decided to have 
student leaders at his house and at my house for

04:40.023 --> 04:49.693
meals. And he himself mixed up hamburger meat with 
onions and mustard and made hamburgers for the

04:51.040 --> 04:58.150
kids. And I had funding from the alumni where I 
could do things like that and let Randy Matson pay

04:58.931 --> 05:04.800
for it. So when they came to my house the next month, 
I had little sirloin strip steaks. And he was mad.

05:11.769 --> 05:18.940
And he came up to me and says, Cooper, he said, they 
come to the president's home and get hamburgers,

05:11.769 --> 05:18.940
and they come to his assistant's home and get 
sirloin strips. I says, how's this going to look?

05:21.449 --> 05:47.338
had a note he can be temperamental I mentioned the 
admissions incident and I mentioned the

05:21.449 --> 05:47.338
University of Hill comment about the two Board of 
Regents he took me to Fort Riley Kansas with him to

05:21.449 --> 05:47.338
inspect the summer ROTC camp big contingency of 
Aggies there and they they used

05:50.913 --> 06:02.526
dozens and dozens of airplanes to shuttle us from 
the airport to Fort Riley. And he was greatly

06:02.546 --> 06:08.272
opposed to smoking, especially in confined 
areas. It really bothered him. So we got in this

06:10.435 --> 06:19.705
plane, and he and I, they had taken the luggage 
compartment out of the back end of this little

06:10.435 --> 06:19.705
plane, and he and I were squeezed in that luggage 
space. The pilot was a hot shot, and he started

06:20.731 --> 06:24.819
smoking immediately. It was one of those hot days 
with convection currents just knocking the

06:24.899 --> 06:31.974
little old plane. It was sickening. And I could 
tell that he was getting uptight. And finally, he

06:37.284 --> 06:41.693
said to the pilot, yelling over four or five other 
men, Can't you get this thing up a little bit

06:43.006 --> 06:46.870
higher, get a little more altitude on it? He said, 
we're really getting bounced around back here.

06:49.753 --> 06:50.894
And this pilot looked back. He says, hell, man. He 
said, we're so far overloaded. He says, it's a

06:54.417 --> 06:56.319
wonder we're up this high. And he looked at me, and 
he said, Edwin talked to the colonel. He says, when

07:00.003 --> 07:03.406
this is over, we're going to drive back in a staff 
car. We're not getting back on the plane. And I told

07:06.690 --> 07:10.393
you about planning more than we cut. And someone 
sent me this hate letter. and thought you should

07:12.689 --> 07:17.576
know that they signed your name to it. Those were 
some impressions that I had of him. And then this

07:21.382 --> 07:27.952
little talk was about both Rutter and Williams and 
what I said to the old group. As you and I reflect

07:27.972 --> 07:35.323
back on things as we knew them in old Army days, 
there have been some changes which we might

07:27.972 --> 07:35.323
personally regret. But the broad thrust these 
last 30 years has indeed been forward. And as one

07:40.651 --> 07:48.220
writer said, upon what we remember, nothing is 
more responsible for the good old days than a bad

07:40.651 --> 07:48.220
memory.

07:51.044 --> 07:56.591
And so those were the things that I brought to that 
Sol Ross group. As

07:56.691 --> 08:05.202
far as you know, what were the factors that caused 
frustration between him and the board? What did

08:06.363 --> 08:08.025
they disagree about?

08:11.988 --> 08:23.684
He wasn't that open about he would let you know that 
there had been a terrible argument about

08:11.988 --> 08:23.684
something. But it was real hard to get out of him 
what the argument was about. He had another policy

08:30.673 --> 08:35.920
after he was so gifted at speaking. I'd say, well, 
somebody prominent like, say, Polly Krueger has

08:42.397 --> 08:49.506
called and wants to know if he can have a copy of that 
speech that you made at the San Antonio Club. And he

08:50.667 --> 08:54.912
said, tell Mr. Krueger that I lost it. He would 
never give anybody a copy of his speeches. Like I

08:59.358 --> 09:03.723
asked him a few times for some of those anecdotes, 
like the brick. And after he was no longer here,

09:05.085 --> 09:11.593
Nelda gave me a copy, but not while he was here. I

09:12.907 --> 09:29.923
know that some of what they fussed about had

09:12.907 --> 09:29.923
to do with personnel approvals. And I can't even 
give you an example of someone that he either

09:31.945 --> 09:39.792
thought should have a job or should not in a high 
position that the board I do know that he

09:41.054 --> 09:55.496
had a difficult time understanding what their 
position was in regards to enrollment growth. I

09:55.516 --> 09:59.642
know that there were difficulties about such 
things as well. Housing is such a terrible

10:00.924 --> 10:02.968
problem. Should the university add more housing, 
or should we not compete with a the free economy,

10:10.754 --> 10:16.700
whether or not to build more dormitories. That was 
a dispute.

10:22.426 --> 10:26.231
There was, I know, some talk about what admission 
requirements would be. I know that Mr.

10:27.111 --> 10:39.765
Weisenbaker, for example, always felt that we 
should just let her go, and that most of the wealthy

10:27.111 --> 10:39.765
people like him were C students anyway, and so how 
could we hold them back? And I remember I was

10:40.927 --> 10:48.458
invited when I was dean of admissions, and I know it 
had to be in the Williams era. Yeah, I know it did. To

10:51.302 --> 11:00.775
bring them a report on a Sunday afternoon at one of 
their meetings on enrollment projections And I

11:01.885 --> 11:06.850
was led to believe possible ways to control 
enrollment. And I had a whole battery of ideas on

11:06.870 --> 11:11.535
that subject. I had a slide show all made up and 
appeared before them. And before I even started my

11:16.840 --> 11:31.875
presentation,

11:16.840 --> 11:31.875
one of the board members asked about how admission 
changes requirements would affect enrollment.

11:34.636 --> 11:37.661
And that was the last word that I spoke that day. And 
I went home terribly frustrated because I worried

11:37.701 --> 11:50.041
over getting a nice presentation together and 
didn't say one damn thing. Not only that, when I got

11:50.822 --> 12:00.377
home, I decided to mix up a good strong bourbon and 
soda and walk out in the backyard and stare at my

11:50.822 --> 12:00.377
tomatoes. One of my grandsons had gotten a 
bad-bitten racket and leveled the entire crop.

12:06.361 --> 12:08.484
And there were my tomatoes all over the yard. And 
the regents wouldn't listen to me. So it was

12:11.789 --> 12:12.870
frustrating. But those are the kinds of things 
that would upset him. And I

12:17.096 --> 12:26.550
think even basic philosophies about the 
direction the university should be moving and the

12:27.256 --> 12:30.301
kind of faculty that we should be pursuing. Just 
nearly everything that came up, they would have

12:30.561 --> 12:37.392
somebody on that board. And Mrs. Williams, the

12:39.114 --> 12:52.335
hardness that we have experienced in talking with 
her since he died, I think she is convinced, was

12:53.108 --> 13:00.421
convinced, that they were just trying to run him 
off and it killed him. What do you think his goals

13:00.882 --> 13:05.891
were for A&M? I think that he wanted more quality 
and less quantity. And when you talk about

13:12.302 --> 13:15.969
students, then you're talking about facilities, 
too. And you're talking about faculty, too. And I

13:18.050 --> 13:21.614
know that the medical school, he hoped for a law 
school. He wanted us a little broader. The medical

13:24.097 --> 13:28.842
school, I know for sure, was a pet hope. I feel less 
about the law school in terms of what his hopes were

13:29.183 --> 13:40.496
than I did the medical.

13:41.777 --> 13:46.943
Did he have, as far as you know, any particular 
strong supporters on the board? and or strong

13:47.277 --> 13:49.079
opponents?

13:56.186 --> 13:57.967
None come to mind either way.

14:00.750 --> 14:12.802
But I got the definite

14:00.750 --> 14:12.802
feeling that he would have given most anything not 
to have to go to their meetings, because somebody

14:00.750 --> 14:12.802
there would upset him every time. In a light moment 
one day, He said something about playing golf the

14:16.420 --> 14:20.808
afternoon the board meeting ended. And I said, 
sir, I have heard you say that you're not a very good

14:22.070 --> 14:30.004
golfer, but you seem to play golf every afternoon 
when the board has just left. Well, I don't

14:30.125 --> 14:31.187
understand. And he said, when I put that golf ball 
on that tee, I then have the image there is a certain

14:31.207 --> 14:39.762
regent's

14:40.585 --> 14:47.272
posterior there, and when I tee off, I can release a 
little bit of energy. The key people that he relied

14:48.053 --> 15:00.347
upon, Dr. Byers retired as the chief academic 
officer, and you were already over there. How did

15:00.387 --> 15:05.833
he come to identify John Calhoun as the vice 
president of academic affairs?

15:18.014 --> 15:23.581
I

15:18.014 --> 15:23.581
don't know. Because it was a personal search. 
There wasn't a committee or anything like that. I

15:29.949 --> 15:34.214
was not privy to any discussion on that subject. He 
asked me. But I know he had.

15:40.964 --> 15:45.972
With all contacts I had with him, he had the highest 
regards for him and for you. For Winerdi, I heard a

15:45.992 --> 16:07.765
conversation one time that John evidently said, 
you know what, Winerdi is suggesting that we do on

15:45.992 --> 16:07.765
this topic or whatever, and I remember Dr. 
Williams' response was, well, turn him loose and

15:45.992 --> 16:07.765
let him fly, or something like that. But he had a lot 
of confidence in that team that was over there. And

16:13.866 --> 16:17.849
then he was the one that selected John Colas. Which 
was a tremendous. Oh, my. Yeah. And I don't know how

16:24.195 --> 16:28.098
that happened. He did not consult with or ask 
advice from me on things like that. He had his own.

16:36.506 --> 16:38.207
Now, you have to understand. You have to think that 
a lot of his contacts in the job that he had in Austin

16:39.284 --> 16:52.478
would put him in touch with both academic and 
student services types of people. In Austin, he

16:52.678 --> 17:06.253
didn't have the close friendship with the kinds of 
friendships that Mr. Rutter had, but he had been

16:52.678 --> 17:06.253
the first commissioner of higher education in the 
coordinating board. describe William's method

17:06.638 --> 17:34.198
of operation with Austin realities legislature 
and coordinating board

17:06.638 --> 17:34.198
like let's make believe it's a budget hearing day 
well he

17:06.638 --> 17:34.198
he could defend I think better than anyone I ever 
saw his request for increases in a given area and

17:35.495 --> 17:55.036
was just phenomenal at explaining why that 
particular school should be moving in that

17:35.495 --> 17:55.036
direction as related to its mission, which was 
written out better than anybody ever saw. And then

17:55.096 --> 18:03.865
he used

17:55.096 --> 18:03.865
student presentations there and always made sure 
those were good, sharp people. But he knew the

18:05.178 --> 18:10.683
legislative process, and he knew how to. He had his 
own sources on how someone would act at a given

18:11.384 --> 18:18.611
time. I used to go to the coordinating board 
meetings. And frankly, I was appalled at a great

18:27.000 --> 18:32.485
deal of the ignorance I saw displayed at those 
meetings. And one was a fuss between the old man

18:33.680 --> 18:44.331
with a cigar from Plainview and Mr. Weir that we 
were talking about the other night in Carpus. And

18:44.411 --> 19:01.388
they were fussing about, arguing about whether we 
needed to approve a medical school at Texas Tech or

18:44.411 --> 19:01.388
a law school somewhere else, not the A&M Law 
School. And finally, the old man from from level

19:03.852 --> 19:10.300
land and says, well, which do you think is more 
important, a doctor or a lawyer? He says, it

19:10.320 --> 19:13.384
depends on whether I'm in a hospital or in jail. I 
remember that one. I remember that one. But that he

19:16.909 --> 19:20.653
could work with. Let's see what that is.

19:27.001 --> 19:27.582
Let me turn this on.

19:32.354 --> 19:47.156
The fact is that dealing with the appointed 
members of the coordinating board, he could fly

19:32.354 --> 19:47.156
circles around those people pretty well.

19:50.141 --> 19:54.227
I think make them feel real ignorant if they didn't 
do what he thought was right. I remember a couple of

19:54.748 --> 20:01.618
budget hearings when, with a straight face, he 
would introduce the students that he'd brought as

20:02.358 --> 20:06.724
students that he just happened to encounter as he 
was leaving the campus. He knew nothing about

20:07.745 --> 20:09.066
them. They were just typical A&M students, just 
average run of the mill. And of course, all the

20:12.951 --> 20:15.835
legislators would roll their eyes. They knew it 
was coming on. But what do you think were, you

20:18.518 --> 20:23.725
mentioned his greatest accomplishments. do you 
remember any anecdotes, events, frustrations of

20:24.059 --> 20:39.099
good humor and or where something went wrong and or 
of where something went? Yes. One that comes to

20:41.001 --> 20:53.357
mind is that as his assistant, as I did with Rudder 
before him at graduation ceremonies, I would

20:41.001 --> 20:53.357
present him with a bound soft leather book that had 
every movement, every word that was to be spoken at

20:54.637 --> 21:05.051
commencement and commissioning exercises. And I 
was up on the stage as a commencement got underway.

21:13.903 --> 21:17.488
And he came to me and whispered and said, do you have 
a? spare copy of that book you prepared for me for

21:18.565 --> 21:22.549
today's program? I said, are you talking about the 
commencement program? I said, you don't have your

21:26.254 --> 21:30.418
book?

21:30.438 --> 21:39.268
And he said, well, I went back to the men's room a 
while ago and I'd put it up on that, he said, you know

21:30.438 --> 21:39.268
that tile thing there above the urinals? And I 
said, yeah, I know what it is. He said, I put it up

21:41.130 --> 21:47.037
there and went back into the letterman's lounge 
and missed it and I went back in there and that

21:41.130 --> 21:47.037
thing's gone. I said, I can tell you this, that any 
other commencement from here on, I will have a

21:48.282 --> 21:55.430
spare copy of that, but I don't now. He said, don't 
worry about it. And Haskell, he went through that

21:58.253 --> 22:00.436
program. I think maybe he did better without it 
than he would have with it, including the

22:02.558 --> 22:09.566
introductions. Now that's how smooth he was. He 
was as skillful before an audience as anybody I've

22:11.668 --> 22:17.074
ever known in any capacity. A

22:17.560 --> 22:28.138
mother's club was just putty in his hands and poor 
old General Boatner who was the commandant. Oh

22:29.320 --> 22:39.737
what terrible times we had between the 
commandant's office and the mother's clubs at one

22:29.320 --> 22:39.737
time over a number of issues and he was here then and 
Then he went to Koji Prison and broke up the riots

22:41.523 --> 22:45.207
over there. And somebody was talking to him 
afterwards about how difficult that was. He says,

22:49.432 --> 22:54.518
that was nothing compared to facing an Aggie 
mother's club. Koji Prison. Excuse me. I

22:57.942 --> 22:58.503
deviated. No. Dr. Williams and his skills. I also 
have the impression that in terms of World War II

23:03.188 --> 23:08.374
service record, accomplishments and so forth 
were quite comparable to those of Mr. Rudder but

23:14.908 --> 23:38.901
almost no one knew it that's true and he didn't 
really want to talk about it and he didn't and I

23:14.908 --> 23:38.901
don't know that I have ever talked to anyone who 
ever saw him pull out his medals pull out his

23:14.908 --> 23:38.901
uniform or anything I think he thought it was a 
necessary evil something that he just had to do his

23:14.908 --> 23:38.901
best at while he was there and uh But he would never 
talk about, you know, if you just mentioned a name

23:39.134 --> 23:50.687
to Rutter that sounded like a name that he could 
recall and he would open up and that was over. And

23:51.388 --> 23:57.255
certainly not in Mr. Rutter's case, you're not 
inferring and I'm not either, that he was a

23:51.388 --> 23:57.255
braggart. No. That Rutter was a braggart. It was 
just this was part of his life. What was the typical

24:01.660 --> 24:03.742
daily routine? Compare a typical daily routine in 
the Rutter family office years and the Williams

24:07.957 --> 24:10.320
office years.

24:13.063 --> 24:22.453
Rudder would get to

24:13.063 --> 24:22.453
the office early, and he would have three or four 
things that he'd laid awake at night worrying

24:13.063 --> 24:22.453
about. And he would come in and tell whoever was at 
the phone system there to call so-and-so and dean

24:23.995 --> 24:33.525
so-and-so in that order. And he would get that off 
of his mind. He'd get somebody working on

24:36.462 --> 24:43.049
alternatives to a given problem that was 
bothering him at that time. Then he would go into

24:43.890 --> 24:52.639
the ladies would come in and have two to three feet 
deep of papers for him to sign. And people were

24:52.739 --> 24:56.162
always saying, why don't you delegate that? He 
said, I want to know where every penny is going. And

25:00.827 --> 25:03.630
if I delegate it, I'll lose track and we'll all get 
in trouble. So he refused to sign off

25:04.488 --> 25:09.034
administrative things like that. He expected his 
staff to organize the incoming mail in order of

25:10.536 --> 25:19.268
priority. And if it was really urgent, we'd show it 
to him immediately. If it was a routine urgency, we

25:26.117 --> 25:30.883
would draft a response for it. And most of the time 
he'd sign it, but he would nearly always put a

25:31.150 --> 25:42.424
little note at the bottom so they would know that he 
knew exactly what was in there and it wasn't just a

25:31.150 --> 25:42.424
machine sign-on.

25:43.285 --> 25:47.650
He was one of the best off-the-cuff speakers we 
ever had. I'm talking about Rutter. But if you'd

25:51.035 --> 25:58.264
give him a written speech, which he insisted on, he 
was the world's worst. He could not follow a

25:58.284 --> 26:01.107
written... speech. But he would get up at

26:02.682 --> 26:15.623
the luncheon before commencement and call the 
name of every person in the room and their spouse

26:02.682 --> 26:15.623
and introduce them to each other. Remarkable 
memory about people. As I told you earlier, I would

26:20.130 --> 26:26.740
usually go in every morning while he was signing 
papers and bring up subjects and I would quickly

26:27.175 --> 26:48.168
try to read his mood and if he was in one of those 
staring far away looks you just may as well not

26:27.175 --> 26:48.168
bring up any topic of controversial nature or 
something that required serious thought because

26:27.175 --> 26:48.168
you were not going to get him off of what was on his 
mind.

26:48.529 --> 26:52.896
He would nearly always want to have a big lunch with 
somebody somewhere. and talk about some business

26:53.973 --> 26:57.197
matter. You're saying almost every day? Yeah.

27:03.424 --> 27:04.605
He could not rest. He would come right back. He put 
in a full day and

27:07.709 --> 27:17.480
time meant nothing to him because that was the 
operations of the school. It was all that he really

27:18.001 --> 27:19.763
cared about. Exclusive of family, of course. But 
to get in a plane and go to Lubbock and speak to the

27:24.365 --> 27:31.834
A&M Club in Lubbock was no big deal. That's just 
part of a day. And then try to find some friends to

27:35.218 --> 27:41.366
relax with and tell war stories late at night. 
Williams

27:41.406 --> 27:47.453
was more private about his feelings. When did the 
Williams Day begin?

27:56.090 --> 28:01.116
Williams would spend an hour or two working in his 
office at home. Early, early. Early, early.

28:04.501 --> 28:05.903
That's what I understood. And he really wouldn't 
show until around 9 or 9.30. Because at first I

28:10.048 --> 28:15.014
thought, oh boy, that must be nice to not have to 
come. I didn't realize he'd been working on mail

28:15.034 --> 28:18.338
for two and a half hours. He was very different 
about mail And speech writing, I quickly learned

28:26.296 --> 28:38.209
that was a waste of my time because he didn't depend 
on anyone for his speech material. He just did it

28:39.450 --> 28:43.134
himself and very often wouldn't even have notes.

28:45.957 --> 28:54.767
But he would have a lot of the routine business done 
on mail and what have you before he ever got the

28:45.957 --> 28:54.767
office to spring tapes.

28:55.760 --> 29:15.101
He

28:55.760 --> 29:15.101
was more conservative about he was harder to get to 
see as, let's say, a faculty member or a student or

28:55.760 --> 29:15.101
what have you, harder to get to see than Mr. Rutter 
was. He would turn down lots of invitations for

29:15.121 --> 29:20.687
people to come in and see him and say, well, let 
so-and-so do that. He told me early in the game.

29:24.346 --> 29:40.861
that my primary responsibility for him in this job 
was to be an ombudsman

29:24.346 --> 29:40.861
between his office and the student body. And 
that's really what he wanted me to do. He said a

29:44.545 --> 29:46.807
similar thing to me with the faculty. OK. So he had 
the two bases there covered. And he said, there's

29:51.311 --> 29:53.273
no need, he said, You know these guys better than I 
do, or can get to know them better than I do. You have

29:58.407 --> 29:59.589
more time to do it. I said, that's what I want you to 
do. I want you to help them understand why we're

30:01.933 --> 30:05.518
doing things where we are. Answer all the 
questions that you possibly can. If you need to ask

30:08.102 --> 30:11.187
me, that's fine. But do the best you can to keep 
close to them and let them know they have a friend in

30:11.407 --> 30:18.538
this office. And on that line of thought, about 
that time we had people like Roger Miller, Kent

30:24.826 --> 30:30.593
Caperton, John Sharp, Gary Morrow, Chad Edwards. 
We had quite a few people that we knew. Talking

30:34.699 --> 30:54.124
about what he wanted me to do now, I said, Dr. 
Williams, I know that some of our student leaders,

30:34.699 --> 30:54.124
that we will be able to identify some of them 
through this work that you have us doing, that are

30:34.699 --> 30:54.124
really going to be important. either in politics 
or business or education, I said, why don't we set

30:55.690 --> 31:22.238
up a program here where once,

30:55.690 --> 31:22.238
where when one graduates that we know is really 
going to be sharpie, that we create a position

30:55.690 --> 31:22.238
called, I didn't come right out of that, staff 
assistant. whereby we take that person and let him

31:23.517 --> 31:33.820
or her work in this office reporting to your 
assistant on special projects related to student

31:23.517 --> 31:33.820
affairs. And then, when they do go into their life 
profession, they'll know what it's all about.
