WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:12.144
I mentioned the fact that, and of course this is my own personal impression, and someone else may have a different impression, and Wayne himself, if he were here, would probably have a different impression.

00:12.164 --> 00:19.701
But I had the impression that he felt that the MSC was his MSC, which by and large it really was when you come out.

00:19.761 --> 00:21.685
He was the MSC to most people.

00:22.492 --> 00:31.004
And because of all the programs and the establishment of the MSC Counseling Directorate and Opus and so many other things that he really started from the ground up.

00:32.346 --> 00:44.964
But when I went in as Director of Business Services working for Howard Vestal, the MSC, the physical plant of the MSC came under my jurisdiction.

00:45.805 --> 00:50.592
Now Wayne and I had always had a good relationship and became close friends.

00:50.943 --> 00:58.921
And that's probably the only thing that saved us because he felt like that someone had taken his child away from him.

00:58.941 --> 01:06.859
He still controlled everything that happened within the building, but the building itself and the maintenance and the operation

01:07.312 --> 01:10.076
And the food service, for example, was under my jurisdiction.

01:10.837 --> 01:19.870
And so there was some tension there, not between us personally, but because of the organizational setup that I think he always resented that.

01:20.771 --> 01:23.835
But there were some good reasons for doing it the way we did it.

01:23.855 --> 01:27.160
All right, now let's jump back to sophomore, junior, senior.

01:27.861 --> 01:34.230
What about some jokes, pranks that you remember, whether you were involved in them or not, but they were

01:34.818 --> 02:03.424
you have at least observed and what are some examples of a good bull we called it good bull well we when when I was a sophomore I met Lee on a blind date and the guy in the room next to me in Durham 6 had an old beat-up Chevrolet and he had a date with a young lady from Bryan and our a guy by the name of Johnny Walker

02:04.012 --> 02:06.955
had a date with Lee, and they were in the back seat.

02:07.155 --> 02:08.136
Yeah, was she from Bryan?

02:08.376 --> 02:11.278
She was from Steep Hollow, which is a little Bryan suburb.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.422
And... Y'all ready for a show?

02:15.442 --> 02:31.716
Yeah, how about, that sounds... Then, to make a real long story short on how I met Lee, Don Johnson was the guy that had the date with the girl in the front seat, Betty was her name.

02:32.597 --> 02:33.698
I had already gone to bed.

02:34.083 --> 02:37.868
And he came up and he shook me and he said, Chuck, you've got to help me out of a problem.

02:37.988 --> 02:39.210
He said, I'm in a bind.

02:39.270 --> 02:40.292
I said, what's the matter, Don?

02:40.993 --> 02:43.937
He said, well, I've got a date with this girl downstairs in the car.

02:44.678 --> 02:47.722
And he says, I'm supposed to be going steady with a girl from San Antonio.

02:47.742 --> 02:50.466
And he said, my conscience is beginning to hurt me.

02:50.486 --> 02:52.108
He said, you're going to have to take Betty home.

02:53.405 --> 02:56.491
And he talked me into getting up, putting on my uniform.

02:56.531 --> 03:00.078
Of course, still we've had to wear uniforms any time we left the building.

03:01.280 --> 03:13.523
And I got in the front seat beside Betty, and Don said, drove the car to downtown Bryan and stopped at the stoplight in front of the Old Palace Theater.

03:14.347 --> 03:15.210
The light was red.

03:15.832 --> 03:22.936
He got out of the car and said to Betty, who's in the middle, Betty, Chuck's gonna take you home and he'll explain everything.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.380
And he walked off.

03:24.922 --> 03:26.668
The car's idling at the red light.

03:27.543 --> 03:29.646
Lee's in the back seat with Johnny Walker.

03:30.047 --> 03:34.373
Of course, I'm looking in the rearview mirror and seeing, boy, that's your pretty little girl in the back seat.

03:34.713 --> 03:38.098
But I took Betty home and called Lee the next day, and then we started dating.

03:38.759 --> 03:54.782
But in any event, after Lee and I started dating, we had my uncle, this uncle that I mentioned to you that was in the Corps, class of 38, had given me an old 42 Plymouth.

03:55.370 --> 03:57.592
which was a fairly new car at that time.

03:57.632 --> 04:02.877
This was in 50, whatever, it was an 8-, 9-, 10-year-old car.

04:03.658 --> 04:12.887
But the guys were always giving me a hard time because I was one of the few guys that was dating a nice-looking local girl because girls were very scarce in those days.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.669
You know, they used to come in on weekends for events.

04:16.710 --> 04:23.537
But as I recall, they took the hubcaps off of that old car and filled them full of shrimp.

04:24.530 --> 04:28.776
and put the hubcaps back on, and we couldn't find where the stink was coming from.

04:30.018 --> 04:36.968
And after a while, somebody confessed, but we had a time with, you know, stuff like that.

04:38.650 --> 04:50.907
One of the things that we used to have, the dorm doors opened inward, and so when the door was closed, the doorknob would stick out in the hall.

04:52.390 --> 04:54.132
You remember the old wooden coat cases?

04:54.753 --> 04:58.157
You'd have the handles on each side where you stick your fingers in.

04:58.257 --> 05:02.783
Well, you'd knock off the wooden end of the thing, and there would be an oval opening.

05:03.304 --> 05:15.960
You saw a notch just about that wide in the bottom of that stick of that board, and you could slip that down over the handle of the door, and they were locked inside.

05:15.980 --> 05:24.270
There's no way they're going to get out because the board, you know, it was one-inch pine lumber, and we had a name for those boards.

05:24.503 --> 05:28.910
but I won't tell you on tape what the board was, but the second word was stick.

05:29.411 --> 05:33.257
All right, now, who would get that treatment?

05:33.277 --> 05:34.378
What would... Upperclassmen.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.084
Then they would... Were they all upperclassmen?

05:38.104 --> 05:40.668
No, just someone that we particularly had it in for, you know.

05:41.109 --> 05:43.052
There was always some nerds around.

05:43.953 --> 05:46.137
All right, thank you, honey.

05:46.157 --> 05:52.687
Haskell, here's yours.

05:52.707 --> 05:52.907
Ahem.

05:53.208 --> 05:56.434
What about some other pranks or jokes that you remember?

05:59.821 --> 06:03.909
Did y'all do any drowned outs that were unusual in design?

06:04.691 --> 06:05.031
Yes.

06:06.414 --> 06:15.672
We didn't do any drowned outs in the dorm, but back to my freshman year on the NX, we used to have a lot of drowned outs.

06:16.225 --> 06:41.541
the barracks were so open that you could be easily caught and easily identified if you drowned out someone in your barracks so you'd make a contract with someone in another barracks someone he wanted drowned out that we didn't even know and then someone that we wanted drowned out that he didn't know so he would drown out our target and then we would drown out his target so that was a that was a kind of an interesting deal what would be the compensation for

06:42.061 --> 06:43.042
this contract?

06:44.103 --> 06:46.205
It wasn't money?

06:46.225 --> 06:51.169
Oh no, no, it would just be for the good bull of it, just the good bull.

06:51.189 --> 06:53.732
Would it be perhaps a swap?

06:53.752 --> 06:55.313
Yes, oh yes, right.

06:56.294 --> 07:00.718
It would be a quid pro quo exchange.

07:01.159 --> 07:10.127
In general, the drown out victim, or any other good bull victim, was somebody that deserved it?

07:10.495 --> 07:11.216
Not always.

07:11.276 --> 07:13.838
Sometimes you'd drown out your buddies just for something to do.

07:14.579 --> 07:21.005
I remember also one time we all had ponchos because it rained.

07:21.986 --> 07:30.734
One of the guys, you know, you made up your bed that the top sheet and the top blanket were just stretched so tight that you could bounce a quarter on them.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.617
That was one of the tests they gave to see if you had made up your bed properly.

07:34.478 --> 07:36.840
Well, we took the blanket and the sheets off

07:37.310 --> 07:58.963
and made an indentation in the mattress by pulling some slats out, put a poncho in the bottom, filled it full of water, caught some fish and frogs out of the little ditch that ran out in front and put those in there so that they were live swimming around, stretched the blanket and the sheet back over and made up the bed so that it was just immaculate.

07:59.568 --> 08:06.996
And the guy goes to get in bed that night, he pulls back his sheet and hear all these fish swimming in this little aquarium that we built in the middle of his bed.

08:07.596 --> 08:08.858
Babo bombs were big.

08:10.359 --> 08:25.895
You'd put a firecracker in a can of babo, throw it in a room and shut the door right quick and when the firecracker went off, the babo would just permeate everything, closets, books, everything.

08:26.436 --> 08:28.798
Who usually had to clean up the babo?

08:29.048 --> 08:36.957
The guy whose room, you know, no one would ever admit that they did it, so he was on his own to clean the mess up, even though he had nothing to do with it.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.840
And that was rare.

08:41.301 --> 08:45.566
Did y'all ever do that with Austin College?

08:45.606 --> 08:51.833
We sometimes used competitively rotten grapefruit or orange with a babble bomb in it.

08:52.252 --> 08:53.354
Never did that.

08:54.475 --> 09:00.844
And this was a fairly rare occurrence because, you know, it did some damage and people just don't want to do that.

09:01.786 --> 09:04.450
Another deal was what we call a float out.

09:06.312 --> 09:14.985
You'd go into a guy's room while he was in class or something and you'd stop up his sink and turn on the hydrant.

09:15.775 --> 09:21.261
And then you would come out and close his door and stuff a towel underneath the door so the water couldn't get out.

09:21.842 --> 09:24.024
It would get two, three feet deep in his room.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.568
And that was pretty destructive, but that happened occasionally.

09:27.908 --> 09:29.710
Now, were the floors cement?

09:30.251 --> 09:31.813
They were cement.

09:32.013 --> 09:37.119
And as I recall, the halls were not carpeted at that time.

09:37.859 --> 09:38.961
You used to play hall hockey.

09:38.981 --> 09:45.748
You'd take a shoe polish can and brooms and play hockey up and down the halls.

09:46.555 --> 09:48.397
And no, no carpets at all.

09:48.678 --> 09:52.402
I think you could bring a little throw rug with you or something like that, but no carpeting.

09:54.325 --> 10:07.922
In the more serious activities in those three years, what extracurricular activities were you involved in?

10:08.358 --> 10:12.544
Of course, by working in the bowling alley, I was on the bowling team.

10:12.684 --> 10:14.406
I was in the ping pong club.

10:14.767 --> 10:21.616
The ham radio club was up above the desk area of the bowling alley.

10:21.716 --> 10:23.799
So I was a member of the ham radio club.

10:24.060 --> 10:26.123
Never did learn the Mars code all the way through.

10:26.163 --> 10:29.387
Let's see.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.431
Never was in student government.

10:32.451 --> 10:35.678
I never had time because I was always working every spare minute that I had.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.645
That's about it as I recall.

10:38.785 --> 10:48.287
Of the extracurricular organizations, which ones do you think among you and your fellow students had the highest prestige?

10:48.841 --> 10:51.348
I'm talking about band and MSC Council.

10:51.488 --> 10:56.020
I'd say MSC Council and Directorate probably was the most prestigious group.

10:56.661 --> 11:01.855
The band, we considered that more of a core outfit than a club type of an activity.

11:02.611 --> 11:11.760
And even though they, of course, played instruments, it was a, and a lot of places, especially in high school, you'd think is the guys that didn't play football being in the band kind of sissies.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.241
At A&M, the opposite is true.

11:13.281 --> 11:17.645
The band was the toughest outfit on the campus, and I think probably still is to this day.

11:18.186 --> 11:19.767
Very prestigious organization.

11:20.448 --> 11:27.955
Which student leader by the office they held, which student leaders had the highest prestige?

11:28.275 --> 11:32.179
The Cadet Colonel of the Corps had to be on top of the heap.

11:32.260 --> 11:36.365
Did you even have a president of a student body then?

11:36.605 --> 11:39.228
I don't even remember that we had a president of a student body.

11:39.248 --> 11:42.852
I've heard the mention of others of your... Yeah.

11:43.112 --> 11:43.933
I don't ever remember.

11:44.534 --> 11:45.555
What would be the other?

11:46.155 --> 11:48.038
Would band commander, would that be?

11:48.058 --> 11:48.818
Would be tops?

11:49.279 --> 11:51.181
It'd be almost like a military organization.

11:51.221 --> 11:55.966
You know, the wing commanders and so forth would be prestigious.

11:56.087 --> 12:01.172
Of course, the Yale leaders were very prestigious positions.

12:01.232 --> 12:01.913
Senior class president?

12:03.074 --> 12:03.775
Not so much.

12:03.835 --> 12:06.619
I don't remember that being all that big a deal.

12:07.240 --> 12:12.307
As far as you were aware, were there any secret fraternities when you were an undergraduate?

12:12.327 --> 12:17.275
We heard rumors that there was a secret group.

12:18.336 --> 12:21.100
I recall they were called T-Men or something like that.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.783
A secret group, yeah.

12:23.963 --> 12:25.185
You're saying singular?

12:25.205 --> 12:26.046
Singular, yes.

12:26.487 --> 12:33.258
That's the only one I ever heard of, and supposedly it was so secret that no one really knew for a fact if it even existed.

12:33.539 --> 12:35.402
What was their supposed purpose?

12:37.004 --> 12:37.906
Never knew that even.

12:37.926 --> 12:48.623
See, I have the impression that in the 30s and earlier there were more than one, and that their purpose was to get their members into the key

12:49.008 --> 12:51.471
positions in the Corps and so forth.

12:51.491 --> 12:52.312
Could very well be.

12:52.533 --> 12:53.434
Oh, Ross volunteered.

12:53.494 --> 12:54.355
I failed to mention them.

12:54.395 --> 12:56.498
That was a very prestigious group.

12:57.479 --> 13:07.593
And let's see, in those days you had to be in the Corps the first two years, could then drop from the Corps, correct?

13:07.613 --> 13:08.414
Not at that point.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.859
All four years you were in the Corps.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.222
You were not allowed to

13:14.776 --> 13:17.759
to drop out of the Corps up until several years later.

13:18.039 --> 13:18.479
I've forgotten.

13:18.620 --> 13:23.124
I don't know just when that occurred, but we were in the Corps the whole time, all four years.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.227
Right now, there were still a number of World War II veterans.

13:26.447 --> 13:26.947
Yes.

13:26.967 --> 13:27.768
Where did they live?

13:27.868 --> 13:29.850
Not too many toward my junior and senior year.

13:29.890 --> 13:32.032
Most of the freshman and sophomore year, there were some.

13:32.853 --> 13:38.158
But they, as I recall, they had their own quarters.

13:38.178 --> 13:39.619
A lot of them weren't in.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.483
Now, as I recall, and I may be wrong on this,

13:43.835 --> 13:46.701
But I think returning veterans were not required to be in the Corps.

13:47.021 --> 13:48.504
I think that was the only exception.

13:50.428 --> 13:54.956
Let's see, Guyon Hall.

13:55.097 --> 13:57.161
What happened in Guyon Hall?

13:58.022 --> 14:06.619
Guyon Hall was, I thought, one of the prettiest buildings on the campus and later turned out to be one of the best constructed buildings on the campus.

14:06.953 --> 14:08.716
It was right at the foot of Military Walk.

14:08.736 --> 14:11.279
Of course, the Bisa Hall was on the other end of Military Walk.

14:12.461 --> 14:14.544
That was kind of the social gathering place.

14:14.924 --> 14:19.371
In those days, they showed movies in Guyon Hall, and we always enjoyed that.

14:20.793 --> 14:29.265
When you were a cadet officer of the day, and that rotated around you, maybe you got it once or twice during your

14:29.245 --> 14:30.346
career at A&M.

14:31.047 --> 14:32.508
You got to go see the movies free.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.290
So everybody liked half of the movies when you were the OD.

14:36.751 --> 14:44.678
And they had, as I recall, they had some religious, we had what we call Religious Emphasis Week.

14:45.499 --> 14:50.062
And we'd have various speakers to come in and those were usually in Guyon Hall.

14:52.144 --> 14:55.307
I'm not sure if we had commencement exercises in Guyon Hall or not.

14:55.807 --> 14:56.468
Maybe we did.

14:56.488 --> 14:59.050
Do you remember any famous

14:59.941 --> 15:05.327
personalities that came to the campus for any purpose during your years as an undergraduate?

15:06.849 --> 15:09.292
Are you talking about Guyon Hall still or just anywhere?

15:09.312 --> 15:25.611
Oh yes, I remember there were one year after I was dating Leigh, she was with me, we had two or three busloads of fairly famous movie stars that came through on a tour of some type.

15:26.047 --> 15:27.730
Keenan Wynn was there.

15:27.930 --> 15:29.553
John Wayne was there.

15:30.575 --> 15:33.680
They ate a meal with us in Duncan Hall.

15:35.122 --> 15:41.974
I'm not sure if it was with this group, but I know that Bob Hope was on the campus once or twice.

15:43.036 --> 15:52.071
Of course, one of the things that impressed me most as far as dignitaries coming was Eisenhower was here one time.

15:52.507 --> 15:54.631
Did you get to see him?

15:54.651 --> 15:55.492
I was in the audience.

15:55.713 --> 15:56.314
That's what I mean?

15:56.334 --> 15:58.117
Yes, yes, uh-huh.

15:58.137 --> 16:02.365
And then, of course, one of the things that stands out in my mind is General Rutter's funeral.

16:03.347 --> 16:09.318
And after everyone was in place, then LBJ walks down the aisle.

16:09.638 --> 16:12.564
And that was, I remember that as if it happened yesterday morning.

16:12.584 --> 16:13.786
Oh, help me, help me.

16:13.806 --> 16:13.906
Yeah.

16:13.926 --> 16:14.988
Were you there by any chance?

16:15.669 --> 16:15.890
You betcha.

16:15.910 --> 16:16.050
Uh-huh.

16:16.233 --> 16:24.124
Shivers, Conley, everybody was there.

16:24.705 --> 16:28.851
Well, that was almost like a who's who that mattered in the real world.

16:28.891 --> 16:29.592
Absolutely.

16:32.296 --> 16:45.514
During those three years on the main campus, when you're dating this young lady and that gets serious, where did you all go for enjoyable evenings?

16:46.253 --> 16:48.175
Well, we'd go to the movies from time to time.

16:48.375 --> 16:52.960
Of course, as a sophomore, I still had to observe CQ.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.323
So during the week, I was pretty well out.

16:56.904 --> 17:06.053
On weekends, I would usually go to church out at Steep Hollow and then go to her parents' house for Sunday lunch, fried chicken and all the trimmings and what have you.

17:08.495 --> 17:13.020
But I guess the big social event we had was Saturday night movies.

17:13.304 --> 17:17.872
And a lot of times they'd have late movies, so we'd be able to stay up and watch the late movie.

17:19.134 --> 17:23.222
And that was before the television days, so movies were, that was their big deal.

17:23.903 --> 17:25.987
All right, now I'm assuming that y'all didn't drink.

17:26.508 --> 17:26.728
No.

17:26.928 --> 17:34.101
But where did your contemporaries, if they were going to, if they were going to drink, did they, was hard liquor still going then?

17:34.261 --> 17:36.325
Hard liquor was still going, but...

17:38.532 --> 17:40.816
Now, it was legal to serve beer there.

17:41.097 --> 17:41.698
I think so.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.887
And, of course, the river, you could get some hard liquor across the river.

17:46.967 --> 17:47.569
Whiskey Bridge.

17:47.589 --> 17:49.813
Whiskey Bridge, yeah.

17:50.133 --> 17:55.202
Are there other places that serve beer in the Bryan area?

17:55.343 --> 17:56.004
I don't think so.

17:56.425 --> 17:59.330
I don't remember seeing beer served here.

17:59.951 --> 18:02.616
And I've never heard any mention of a house of ill repute.

18:03.035 --> 18:12.807
The only place that was up and going when I was there, so I've been told, obviously, was the Chicken Ranch.

18:12.827 --> 18:13.107
Chicken Ranch.

18:13.127 --> 18:14.589
Chicken Ranch.

18:14.609 --> 18:18.975
And then there was a motel in Seeley, Texas, that was pretty famous.

18:20.196 --> 18:25.162
And in fact, a guy in our outfit used to date one of the girls on a pretty regular basis.

18:25.202 --> 18:26.804
He was one of the wealthier guys.

18:27.465 --> 18:31.590
Now, as far as the myths went,

18:31.925 --> 18:35.349
Were there Aggies who went to LaGrange, to the chicken rink?

18:35.369 --> 18:37.972
Yes, I understand that a lot of them were football players.

18:39.033 --> 18:45.501
And I'm not sure how much of this I'm remembering from actual life and how much I'm remembering from the best little whorehouse in Texas, you know.

18:45.521 --> 18:46.922
They kind of run together.

18:47.943 --> 18:53.730
Who were the celebrity students during your time?

18:56.123 --> 19:07.378
Weldon Kruger, of course, was one of our, he was the cadet colonel of the Corps, and he recently, you know Weldon, I presume, he moved back to town, and he's a classmate of mine, class of 53.

19:08.279 --> 19:14.187
Ed Cooper and Bill Pressnell and me and Lee Phillips and just a whole lot of us in class 53 still live here.

19:14.888 --> 19:19.574
In fact, there's so many class of 53 guys that live here now that we get together once a month.

19:19.954 --> 19:25.962
We're not able to go too much because we're in a bridge club that conflicts with the date, but we have 40 or 50

19:26.819 --> 19:29.582
people in the class of 53 that have moved back here.

19:30.743 --> 19:33.766
And so we get together once a month for dinner and what have you.

19:33.866 --> 19:35.647
So it's kind of a mini, mini reunion.

19:36.969 --> 19:39.591
That reminds me of a question I've not asked anybody else.

19:39.851 --> 19:43.195
I'm not going to ask you anything except the positive on this.

19:44.636 --> 19:56.067
Based on your recollection of them as students, have some of them their success

19:56.620 --> 20:06.430
as a graduate of Texas A&M given far greater promise than their career there would have.

20:06.870 --> 20:11.314
Roland Krueger was a campus student leader and he did very, very well.

20:11.334 --> 20:11.675
Yes.

20:12.335 --> 20:14.077
Are there some others that went?

20:14.097 --> 20:14.357
Yes.

20:14.998 --> 20:19.583
I would say the correlation is almost perfect.

20:20.664 --> 20:25.108
We have a guy named Joe Matti who was a big campus leader in our class.

20:25.409 --> 20:29.380
has done extremely well with his career.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.509
I'm not sure exactly what he's done, but I know he's been very successful.

20:35.076 --> 20:37.242
We have

20:37.677 --> 20:47.554
A guy named Jim Upmore, who was a classmate of ours from a little country community out from West Texas, became H.B.

20:47.574 --> 20:53.163
Zachary's leading land man and a very wealthy realtor in Houston and San Antonio.

20:53.183 --> 20:55.707
He had some problems, but I think he's weathered those pretty well.

20:57.250 --> 21:00.175
Oh, my goodness.

21:01.859 --> 21:09.409
Gene Steed, who was a wing commander, as I recall, wound up I think as a district judge or something someplace.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.414
So there is a definite correlation there.

21:14.155 --> 21:27.512
Do you remember during your undergraduate days any worldwide event, any world important event, that caused you to kind of stop and remember and think, oh my goodness, like the Korean War started?

21:27.712 --> 21:28.012
Yes.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.937
Well, of course, as I mentioned, I was a kid during the Second World War.

21:31.957 --> 21:46.232
I was too young to go, but I was a newspaper carrier during the Second World War, and I was... The Second World War had a tremendous impact on me personally, and I used to read the paper from cover to cover, everything I could find.

21:46.292 --> 21:50.877
I still watch the History Channel all the time to see what's been going on.

21:52.359 --> 21:55.322
So when the Korean War came along,

21:56.585 --> 21:59.970
Of course, I was an A&M in the Corps at the time, headed toward a commission.

22:00.931 --> 22:09.583
And so all of us watched the Korean War with great interest, not only as a citizen of the country, but as probably where we were headed.

22:10.284 --> 22:14.670
Did you and your buddies use those terms that, you know, wrecking wheeled?

22:15.911 --> 22:16.512
All the time.

22:16.893 --> 22:17.534
All the time.

22:18.034 --> 22:23.622
And with mixed emotions, nobody wants to go to war, but we had been...

22:24.293 --> 22:28.721
trained and practiced for this all of our college life so we were ready to go.

22:28.781 --> 22:46.133
As it worked out I had my orders to report to the port of embarkation headed for Yokohama, Japan after I received my commission and had the orders in hand getting ready to leave and I got another set of orders

22:46.417 --> 22:52.884
after the peace agreement had been signed, rescinding those orders.

22:53.645 --> 22:57.930
And then as it worked out, I never did have to go on active duty during the Korean conflict.

22:58.931 --> 23:01.334
But it was, I missed it by a matter of months.

23:01.795 --> 23:02.575
And let's see.

23:02.596 --> 23:03.296
Almost weeks.

23:03.657 --> 23:05.799
Your and my years are about the same.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.905
So there's no presidential assassinations.

23:11.932 --> 23:16.880
or deaths like Franklin Roosevelt during undergraduate days or something like that.

23:17.701 --> 23:20.385
There's no world famous cataclysm or anything.

23:20.846 --> 23:21.627
Not that I recall.

23:22.629 --> 23:23.009
Let's see.

23:23.330 --> 23:24.271
Back to us.

23:24.291 --> 23:28.558
Describe one of the core trips that you went on.

23:28.578 --> 23:29.840
Oh, core trips were great.

23:30.461 --> 23:39.154
I remember the ones to Dallas and Fort Worth more than anything else because we always had dates at TSCW.

23:40.788 --> 23:45.618
As I mentioned back in those days, our freshman year, no one had cars.

23:45.638 --> 23:50.748
In our upper classmen years, very few people had cars.

23:51.770 --> 23:58.423
But anyone that had a car would load it down until the springs would almost break and we'd head for TSCW.

23:59.144 --> 24:01.108
And we'd have dates there.

24:01.831 --> 24:14.989
I'd almost call them like a boarding house type of arrangement where the Aggies could go in and maybe get five or six or seven in a room, either sleeping on the bed or on the floor or what have you, just for a place to sleep.

24:15.871 --> 24:23.441
Of course, we'd always have the parades down the main streets of Dallas and Fort Worth, depending on who we were playing.

24:24.583 --> 24:28.789
And the parades were very, I thought, were very inspirational.

24:29.029 --> 24:29.910
I always enjoyed them.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.112
What was the public's

24:31.463 --> 24:33.745
reaction to that?

24:34.126 --> 24:35.207
Oh, they loved it.

24:35.527 --> 24:40.692
The turnout, the streets would be just lying with people, the full parade route.

24:41.253 --> 24:49.701
Now, did you then, you Aggies, go to Denton Saturday night and spend the night there and then come back?

24:49.721 --> 24:52.544
Sometime we'd leave on Friday if we'd have a chance.

24:52.724 --> 24:54.586
A Friday night and maybe a Saturday night.

24:54.606 --> 24:55.407
Right, yes.

24:56.548 --> 24:58.990
What about the court trip then to Houston?

25:00.134 --> 25:06.319
I don't remember the Houston court trips as being as much fun as the Dallas-Fort Worth.

25:06.840 --> 25:14.847
Now the Houston court trip usually would wind up going to one of the dance halls where you take a date out to dance or something like that.

25:15.968 --> 25:29.820
I know there was a big one off of South Main out kind of behind where Sonny Looks Steakhouse is near Loop 610 out there that we used to go to from time to time.

25:30.222 --> 25:35.189
When the game was over, he came home, didn't he?

25:35.509 --> 25:36.831
Yes, yes.

25:36.851 --> 25:38.794
I never did really enjoy going to Austin that much.

25:39.494 --> 25:45.763
My roommate, when I was a sophomore, was from Houston, so when we'd go to Houston, I'd usually stay at his house with him.

25:47.165 --> 25:49.728
And he'd get his mom's and dad's car so we'd have some wheels.

25:51.911 --> 25:54.374
Muster, do you remember Muster as an undergraduate?

25:54.795 --> 25:56.297
Yes, I do.

25:57.172 --> 26:03.150
I remember more about Silver Taps because muster of course just came once a year and it was kind of a formalized kind of a deal.

26:03.370 --> 26:04.975
Where was muster held?

26:06.098 --> 26:11.434
Muster was held in G. Raleigh White.

26:12.663 --> 26:13.785
Silver Taps described?

26:13.805 --> 26:19.712
Silver Taps was, the first one I went to probably was the most impressive because I didn't know what we were in for.

26:20.674 --> 26:28.504
But of course, and I presume to this day it still held on the balcony of the academic building.

26:29.125 --> 26:37.877
And we would gather around Lawrence Sullivan Ross' statue and then of course they would have the ceremony and the playing of the bugles in harmony.

26:38.918 --> 26:42.383
But the thing that impressed me most was that many people

26:43.055 --> 26:45.559
could be in a group together and you not hear a sound.

26:45.899 --> 26:46.520
No talking.

26:47.802 --> 26:52.348
I don't know if they still observe that or not, but I mean we didn't even whisper.

26:52.769 --> 26:57.215
It was absolutely, from the time you left your dorm until you got back to the dorm, it was not a word spoken.

26:57.997 --> 26:59.499
And that was impressive with that many people.

27:00.861 --> 27:06.008
As you are getting ready to graduate, and you graduated in four years?

27:06.562 --> 27:07.143
four years.

27:07.243 --> 27:13.349
I had to go two summers to make up for the courses that I messed up on petroleum engineering.

27:13.889 --> 27:15.110
You're getting ready to graduate.

27:16.231 --> 27:21.877
What kind of a world did you think you were getting ready to enter and how well prepared did you think you were?

27:21.897 --> 27:25.781
I think we felt pretty confident that we could make it.

27:26.642 --> 27:30.025
As I recall, the job market was pretty tight.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.328
In fact, I remember interviewing

27:33.612 --> 27:35.935
I specifically wanted to go into retailing.

27:36.456 --> 27:39.060
Probably Herb Thompson kind of influenced me in that direction.

27:40.121 --> 27:45.489
And I wanted to go into retailing, and at that time, the biggest bear in the jungle was Sears Rowboat.

27:46.450 --> 27:47.832
And I wanted to go to work for Sears.

27:47.872 --> 27:57.426
There was a personnel director out of Dallas for this region named Sam Moorhead, former A&M student, and I believe he was a class of 38 also, I'm not sure.

27:58.283 --> 28:04.249
But Sam came down to do the interviewing in the placement office.

28:05.571 --> 28:09.134
And I talked with him and I wanted to go to work for Sears badly.

28:09.795 --> 28:11.356
Well, I didn't get an offer.

28:12.458 --> 28:20.526
And one of my profs, I failed to mention him earlier, but probably had more influence than anyone else, was a gentleman named Satch Elkins.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.510
I don't know what his first name was, we always called him Satch.

28:25.132 --> 28:33.552
But Satch Elkins knew me on a personal basis and knew my interest in going to work for Sears.

28:33.572 --> 28:37.521
So he picked up the phone and called Sam Moorhead, unbeknownst to me.

28:38.378 --> 28:41.181
And I found out later that he had done it because Sam told me.

28:42.342 --> 28:46.807
Called Sam and said that I've got this young man that I want you to take another look at.

28:47.848 --> 28:51.852
And Sam apparently told him, well, we looked at him, almost made an offer.

28:51.872 --> 28:53.974
We just didn't have that many positions to offer.

28:54.535 --> 28:57.598
And he says, based on your recommendation, we'll go ahead and make him an offer.

28:58.239 --> 28:59.480
So I went to work for Sears.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.942
Do you remember what that beginning pay was?

29:02.583 --> 29:03.424
Oh, my goodness.

29:04.349 --> 29:07.752
I remember my second lieutenant's pay was $222 a month.

29:07.992 --> 29:08.953
I'll never forget that.

29:08.973 --> 29:14.638
It was, I can't imagine, but it was just nothing almost.

29:14.658 --> 29:17.761
So this is 19... 1953.

29:19.083 --> 29:19.863
Fall of 53.

29:20.784 --> 29:33.816
Well, I graduated in May and then went to work shortly thereafter in Waco, Texas for a store manager named Neil Gately, who was another guy that had a pretty good influence on my life.

29:33.796 --> 29:39.284
But the program that I went into as a college graduate was called a junior executive training program.

29:40.446 --> 29:48.197
I didn't realize at the time what a junior executive training program was, but my first job was unloading boxcars at the warehouse with a two-wheeler.

29:49.318 --> 29:55.207
And then, of course, they had it as a formalized program, and that's where you started, and you worked in a lot of different departments.

29:55.227 --> 30:01.035
It was an excellent program to groom people for management and seers.

30:02.872 --> 30:16.629
what now do you think, looking back on your entire professional life, what did it mean in terms of developing attitudes and capabilities and so forth?

30:17.130 --> 30:19.733
What did the A&M years mean?

30:20.414 --> 30:25.580
There's no way I could emphasize the importance that I could place on what I picked up at A&M.

30:25.860 --> 30:28.744
As I mentioned, I'd always led a very sheltered life and a very

30:29.298 --> 30:33.305
A life that really went beyond our little town city limits.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.929
When I went to Waco, it was a big occasion.

30:36.570 --> 30:39.576
I'd never been out of McLennan County, I don't think, until I came to A&M.

30:40.217 --> 30:53.179
So A&M is where I picked up my ability to, I feel, what limited ability I have to relate to other people, almost people that are strangers, people that I was not raised with.

30:53.783 --> 30:56.851
I always felt like I had an inferiority complex.

30:57.111 --> 31:07.697
When I went from a small rural school to Waco High School, which was one of the largest high schools in the state at that time, I almost climbed into a shell.

31:07.777 --> 31:10.965
I just felt like that I was not

31:11.620 --> 31:13.042
as good as everybody else was.

31:13.443 --> 31:15.467
Well, A&M taught me differently from that.

31:15.947 --> 31:21.237
That, you know, no matter where you're from, you got the same shot as everybody else has.

31:22.278 --> 31:30.412
And so that, bringing me out of my shell and so forth, I give A&M full credit for that and the Corps specifically.

31:31.574 --> 31:33.658
Right now, have we got time to go a while longer?

31:33.678 --> 31:36.042
Sure, I've got, your time is my time.
