WEBVTT

00:04.081 --> 00:07.768
I think it had a lot to do with the faculty. And we had 
a great faculty relationship. I was never denied

00:11.856 --> 00:18.870
any sort of advising that I felt that I needed. I was 
guided quite well. Now, too, you've got to add to

00:20.292 --> 00:22.697
that the question even with the tremendous growth 
that the university population experienced

00:23.588 --> 00:28.976
during that time. Needless to say, the faculty 
pace could not keep up with it in terms of

00:28.996 --> 00:35.666
student-teacher ratio. But most of the colleges, 
some better than others, did a great job of making

00:36.066 --> 00:44.579
it work anyway. And there was, I mean, I don't know 
of a time that I needed to either go see a professor

00:51.938 --> 01:13.738
in one of my classes, or excuse me, I cannot 
remember a time that I needed to go to see one of my

00:51.938 --> 01:13.738
professors or to see my academic advisor or to see a 
dean or an associate dean even before I became

00:51.938 --> 01:13.738
student body president that I was ever denied. And 
it just wasn't a problem. Now my perception was

01:17.361 --> 01:21.945
that A&M was working then to be inclusive not to 
divide up into special categories. Like I've said

01:27.683 --> 01:38.779
to people, and tell me if you agree or disagree, 
I've said to people, the real important thing was

01:27.683 --> 01:38.779
not what someone's ancestry was, but were you a 
part of A&M?

01:41.383 --> 01:49.755
I had the impression that Jewish kids, Hispanic 
kids, Lebanese kids, in terms of parentage, all

01:41.383 --> 01:49.755
felt part of the group. I'll

01:52.216 --> 01:56.301
say yes and no. And the reason I'll say yes and no is 
sort of the fog. You'll have to reel back, I think,

01:59.044 --> 02:07.454
about 8 to 10 years before 1976. And so let's talk 
about when I may be 10 years, maybe less than that,

02:07.674 --> 02:16.545
about 68, that time frame. Texas had just gone 
through, during that time frame, from 65 to 70. and

02:22.726 --> 02:30.556
even as late as 71 in some instances, forced 
desegregation.

02:30.576 --> 02:46.936
And particularly in towns where there were large 
minority populations, and that generally is the

02:30.576 --> 02:46.936
case as it remains today, sort of like east of 
Interstate 35,

02:30.576 --> 02:46.936
you had had some changes that had taken place. And 
so these are the kinds of kids, now that you've got

02:46.956 --> 02:52.243
at the university environment,

02:53.101 --> 03:08.243
I've always made an argument that supported the 
argument that

02:53.101 --> 03:08.243
kids were ready to make the join the, uh, maybe not 
some of the parents. And so these are the type of

03:08.263 --> 03:15.514
kids that you end up having, but they're mixed in 
with kids from the other part of the state. The

03:15.554 --> 03:18.298
western half of the state where mixed race 
populations are not as great. You've got these

03:21.192 --> 03:26.858
sort of new experiences going on.

03:26.878 --> 03:47.678
Notwithstanding the collectivism that took 
place as a result of the Civil Rights Movement, by

03:26.878 --> 03:47.678
the time you got to about 74, 75,

03:26.878 --> 03:47.678
there was a change, in my view, on the part of that 
population that was beginning to move back into a

03:48.063 --> 04:00.898
separatist, separateness,

03:48.063 --> 04:00.898
looking for an identity, if you will. And so when 
you got, you know, everybody who was just amongst

04:02.120 --> 04:11.471
blacks, for example, there was this thing called 
the Black Awareness Committee. The primary

04:11.491 --> 04:15.015
purpose of the Black Awareness Committee was for 
the purpose of bringing maybe once a year,

04:17.105 --> 04:26.300
somebody who was a prominent black political 
leader or writer or author or whatever to campus

04:17.105 --> 04:26.300
for an event. But the Black Awareness Committee 
also became a social

04:27.542 --> 04:34.493
organization. It also became an activist

04:35.394 --> 04:41.644
organization. in the sense of if there were issues 
that the Black Awareness Committee thought

04:42.029 --> 04:57.969
needed to be brought to the attention of the 
administration, that a lot of these ideas, if any,

04:42.029 --> 04:57.969
flowed from that group.

05:03.335 --> 05:11.125
And it wasn't necessarily, I'm trying to think of 
some issues, but it wasn't necessarily because

05:03.335 --> 05:11.125
people had been denied things. or that people 
thought that they were

05:11.493 --> 05:18.401
being discriminated against. It was more along 
the lines of, you know, we need to have more

05:18.421 --> 05:23.307
opportunities to do this, so help us do that. And so 
that sort of became, that was sort of the

05:23.327 --> 05:32.898
beginning, I think, of sort of the move back to 
divisiveness. It wasn't necessarily promoted by

05:32.918 --> 05:40.707
the university, but it was more promoted by what I 
saw happening sociologically during that time

05:32.918 --> 05:40.707
frame. Well, I think we have it now, today. I think a 
great deal of it today. And it's sort of matured in

05:45.961 --> 05:49.267
the 80s. And so, what had been a forced, what had 
started out as we've been discriminated against,

05:51.551 --> 06:00.487
separate but equal, doesn't work, and all that 
kind of stuff. And the courts say, okay, we're

06:00.507 --> 06:04.855
gonna force you to be equal and we're gonna lump you 
all together. and everybody's going to get along,

06:05.425 --> 06:09.651
and everybody's going to figure out whose badges 
they're going to use, and all this kind of stuff.

06:09.992 --> 06:15.100
When we start getting toward the mid-'70s and 
late-'70s, the war was over. So the draft was gone.

06:18.926 --> 06:29.762
So these other types of things that generally can 
sap the emotions and the thought processes of

06:18.926 --> 06:29.762
people. That distraction wasn't there anymore. 
And so I think that that was, even at conservative

06:32.667 --> 06:40.195
Texas A&M, that that was what was developing 
during that time. Did any of the other minority

06:40.215 --> 06:51.046
students, be they black, Hispanic, or otherwise, 
did any of them ever come and fuss at you for not

06:40.215 --> 06:51.046
doing something they wanted done? I don't 
remember that happening at all. Good. I got fussed

06:53.949 --> 06:57.673
at for other things. Let's see. I was taken before 
the judicial board while I was student body

06:59.649 --> 07:03.437
president. For? Failure to implement a piece of 
legislation that the previous student senate had

07:04.759 --> 07:12.394
enacted. The previous student senate had enacted 
because of the guy who'd been... academic affairs

07:19.861 --> 07:33.881
vice president, a piece of legislation which 
required that students be given the opportunity

07:19.861 --> 07:33.881
to vote confidence or no confidence in members of 
the faculty. And that this was to be published by

07:33.901 --> 07:49.243
student government for the purpose of students 
being able to decide with more scientifically

07:33.901 --> 07:49.243
gathered information, of course, the quality of 
the professors as they chose courses. I was

07:49.460 --> 07:51.143
supposed to have done this. The way the 
legislation was written, it was written such that

07:51.764 --> 08:04.065
it had to be done during the fall semester of the 
particular academic year. And we still going? Of

08:06.329 --> 08:07.470
the particular academic year. You know, on Monday 
I started classes, so it was. So you enrolled the

08:10.075 --> 08:12.259
second? Second summer session. Second summer 
session. So I'd already been a fish by the time fish

08:15.633 --> 08:21.580
camp came around. Did you and your buddy, freshman 
buddies, did you all start using Aggie slang

08:21.940 --> 08:29.389
quickly? Were you fish?

08:34.154 --> 08:34.935
No, not really. As I think back to those days, a lot 
of that had to do with the fact that Number one, I

08:41.452 --> 08:43.155
wasn't in the core. And the core during that time 
frame really had more of the slang associated with

08:43.175 --> 09:01.266
being a fish and all that kind of stuff than did the 
non-rec population on campus.

09:02.225 --> 09:15.742
For example, now the freshmen who are chosen in 
student government to be aides, if you will,

09:02.225 --> 09:15.742
during their first year on campus are called fish 
aides. Back in 1973, that wasn't the case. So more

09:19.827 --> 09:31.101
of the fish aspect and other Aggie slang was more 
associated with being in the Corps of Cadets than

09:19.827 --> 09:31.101
it was otherwise. on campus. Let's jump now to 
September. And you're taking a full load, I

09:35.292 --> 09:37.595
presume. Describe a typical freshman academic 
day. It began when? Oh, I generally loaded it on

09:48.444 --> 10:00.075
pretty well, because what I was trying to do was, 
after having taken a year off, it was my goal and

09:48.444 --> 10:00.075
objective to

10:01.726 --> 10:18.182
complete my undergraduate degree pretty close to 
as well I could those who would have normally

10:01.726 --> 10:18.182
started with me in the fall of 1972 had I not done the 
FFA thing. So I probably was taking 16 to 18 hours

10:18.402 --> 10:28.472
and, you know, again, the beginning of the day and 
worked my way through the end of the day. One of One

10:31.898 --> 10:39.367
of the anecdotes that I was going to mention, I 
distinctly remember, in fact, that's about the

10:31.898 --> 10:39.367
only course I remember from my freshman year. No, 
that's not true. I do remember this one. There was a

10:45.854 --> 10:53.303
new guy on campus in the chemistry department at 
that period in time who was teaching freshman

10:45.854 --> 10:53.303
chemistry named Rod O'Connor. And Rod had 
written, that was during the time frame that

10:58.780 --> 11:08.109
Program learning was sort of like a new thing, at 
least at the secondary school level. And Rod

11:08.750 --> 11:28.450
decided that he was going to write a freshman 
chemistry text that was based on a programmed

11:08.750 --> 11:28.450
learning concept, which basically is you sort of 
like take chapters of stuff and have self-tests

11:08.750 --> 11:28.450
associated with each chapter and the sort of 
building process that goes on in the program

11:08.750 --> 11:28.450
learning aspect of it. And Rod had written this 
chemistry book. And actually, I remember it quite

11:31.313 --> 11:38.884
well because it had been typed and had been reduced 
in size to the size of a book and had been bound. And

11:38.944 --> 11:41.328
that was a textbook that we used. It was over in the 
old chemistry building. There were, I guess, a

11:42.670 --> 11:49.440
couple of hundred of us and freshmen in the class 
taking the introductory chemistry course. And I

11:50.481 --> 11:58.453
remember distinctly going into the room that fall 
and probably 10 at the most of the 200 or so students

11:58.855 --> 12:01.919
had calculators. And of course, there are a lot of 
numbers associated with the way Rod had designed

12:03.301 --> 12:10.150
this freshman course. And there were about, oh, I 
guess, 80% of us who either had access to or knew how

12:10.170 --> 12:19.803
to use a slide rule. So Rod, in an effort to sort of 
have fairness, wouldn't let the guys using the

12:19.823 --> 12:28.474
calculators use their calculators in class But he 
got graduate assistants to do special tutoring

12:29.686 --> 12:48.132
sessions to teach us, those who did not know how to 
use a slide rule, how to use a slide rule so that they

12:29.686 --> 12:48.132
could compete effectively and learn in a 
classroom environment. That's one of the

12:48.152 --> 12:52.198
interesting experiences about my first year 
there. I can understand Rod making the decision

12:52.218 --> 12:57.465
not to, allow the four or five kids or 10 kids who had 
calculators to use them. Uh, but for him to take the

13:04.078 --> 13:28.228
added step of, of going the extra mile to teach 
those kids who did not have knowledge of the slide

13:04.078 --> 13:28.228
rule use so that they could could compete 
effectively and learn in the, in that, in that

13:04.078 --> 13:28.228
learning environment, uh, I think is a great 
attestation to the nature of the relationships

13:04.078 --> 13:28.228
that existed during that time. between faculty 
and students. At the time, the university

13:32.336 --> 13:38.402
probably was about the size, oh, about 14,000 
kids, roughly. And even then, we still had some

13:39.163 --> 13:49.872
large classes, particularly in basic chemistry 
and some of the other courses that we took, history

13:39.163 --> 13:49.872
classes, for example. But that extra effort, I 
think, on Ron's part was indicative of the

13:50.113 --> 13:58.300
pretty much across the board attitude of faculty 
in terms of their relationship with students and

13:58.735 --> 14:17.702
that I think is a great compliment and that is 
something that I hope will never be lost in the

13:58.735 --> 14:17.702
learning environment at Texas A&M. One year later 
ironically that year still sort of broken up for me

14:17.722 --> 14:25.553
because in October I was elected national FFA 
secretary and dropped out of school. So at the end

14:28.411 --> 14:30.254
of your first semester? Not even at the end, I 
dropped out mid-semester. Oh, okay. I dropped out

14:33.518 --> 14:49.080
mid-semester, so now I've only had like one summer 
session under my belt and about six weeks of

14:33.518 --> 14:49.080
undergraduate, I mean of what would have been the 
start of my, or continuation of my freshman year,

14:33.518 --> 14:49.080
whichever, but my first full-time load, if you 
will. And I took incompletes in all of my courses

14:54.406 --> 15:00.556
and traveled around the country for a year as 
National FFA Secretary. I re-enrolled at Texas

15:00.576 --> 15:16.903
A&M in the fall of 1974, and

15:00.576 --> 15:16.903
now with a big whopping one summer session under my 
belt and two years behind my classmates from high

15:00.576 --> 15:16.903
school years, And re-enrolled, fortunately, in 
the classes worked in each of the classes that I had

15:17.677 --> 15:25.686
taken incompletes in the year before. And I want to 
reel forward to that chemistry class again

15:26.466 --> 15:45.507
because when I arrived in the chemistry class the 
fall of 1974 to finally hopefully complete

15:26.466 --> 15:45.507
chemistry 101, 95% of the kids in the class had 
calculators and probably 5% of them We're still

15:45.773 --> 15:55.182
using the slide room, which I think is a tremendous 
example of the advent of technology in one short

15:45.773 --> 15:55.182
year. And it's a very vivid reminder to me of how 
quickly things can change, particularly now. You

16:00.788 --> 16:06.774
get a free calculator that's solar powered for 
doing a subscription to a magazine. And so that was

16:07.735 --> 16:13.941
finally, I got re-enrolled in the school at Texas 
A&M in the fall of 74. At

16:16.869 --> 16:35.088
that time I also came back and changed my major, or 
at least I did at the end of that first semester of

16:16.869 --> 16:35.088
1974 when I was in biochemistry and changed my 
major to agricultural economics. What led you to

16:35.108 --> 16:36.569
make that change? I made the decision that 
throughout the course of that year that I served as

16:42.997 --> 16:51.027
Well, one could make the argument that calculus 
and the perspective of doing organic chemistry

16:42.997 --> 16:51.027
was what made me make that change. That was not. But 
what I decided over the course of the year while I

16:54.712 --> 17:05.885
was serving as National FFA Secretary was that I 
did not want to be a biochemist because of the

16:54.712 --> 17:05.885
options that it provided for me. I was either going 
to teach, which I didn't think was something that I

17:05.946 --> 17:10.371
wanted to do, or I would be engaged in some really 
neat, pure scientific research, which I decided

17:10.992 --> 17:16.517
wasn't my cup of tea. And I ultimately decided I did 
not want to be a physician. But I decided that

17:20.300 --> 17:34.332
perhaps a better role for me, knowing myself a 
little bit better at that time, would be one which

17:20.300 --> 17:34.332
allowed me to have more interaction with people, 
but in a verbal sort of a sense. And I got this idea

17:34.833 --> 17:37.755
that I might want to go to law school. And so the 
course of instruction that I chose was economics

17:40.608 --> 17:50.602
because I had gotten a tremendous amount of 
exposure to the agribusiness world while I was

17:40.608 --> 17:50.602
serving as national secretary. And so I made the 
swap. Was there an academic advisor or advisors at

17:52.425 --> 17:58.413
A&M that helped you? Well, Dr. Brown was sort of my 
buddy during that time frame, needs to say,

17:58.513 --> 18:08.387
because of our relationship that we had developed 
going back to my early FFA days, when I was in high

17:58.513 --> 18:08.387
school, actually. That sort of shifted when I made 
the transition to Ag Eco to Dr. J.C. Grady, who was

18:09.565 --> 18:26.613
my undergraduate advisor, if you will, for the 
remainder of my academic time at A&M. Also in that

18:27.495 --> 18:35.708
bunch was, and this was sort of because of a job that 
I had, I was a student worker in the early, very

18:37.426 --> 19:02.132
earliest days of the, what is now known as the real 
estate center, which was then the Texas real

18:37.426 --> 19:02.132
estate research center, which had sort of been a 
collaboration created primarily by the

18:37.426 --> 19:02.132
professors in the economics department who were 
making a transition from sort of the rural side of

18:37.426 --> 19:02.132
the program to more of the, um, uh, urban side of, 
of, of real estate and real estate development.

19:02.152 --> 19:03.754
And, uh, A former head of the Department of Ag 
Economics, Dr. Pat Rudin, A.B. Pat Rudin, was the

19:09.572 --> 19:14.519
first director of the Real Estate Center. One of 
the other professors who was doing double duty

19:15.661 --> 19:29.100
with the Extension Service, or I guess triple 
duty, the Extension Service, the Research

19:15.661 --> 19:29.100
Center, and also in the Department of Agriculture 
and Economics was a guy named Don Levi. And Don is a

19:29.519 --> 19:33.483
lawyer, had written an agricultural law text. And 
since I'd kind of gotten into this thought that I

19:33.563 --> 19:48.798
might want to be a lawyer, Don and JC Grady were sort 
of my mentors, if you will, in terms of the guidance

19:33.563 --> 19:48.798
that they gave me during my time at A&M. And then 
there was this associate dean over at the College

19:48.818 --> 19:53.562
of Agriculture named R.C. Potts who sort of 
overrode it all. Because I had the impression Dean

19:57.386 --> 19:59.408
Potts had a special role in a lot of students. He 
did. He did. He did. And I'll tell a story about that

20:04.298 --> 20:07.042
later. I'm gathering that because you did not 
start out as a freshman three months out of high

20:07.542 --> 20:28.213
school, that being a part of a certain class didn't 
matter like it would have if you'd been over in the

20:07.542 --> 20:28.213
Corps. That was one of the reasons, in fact, that I 
chose not to be in the Corps.

20:34.265 --> 20:37.630
In fact, that's probably the only reason that I 
chose not to be in the Corps. I felt very strongly

20:39.613 --> 20:57.880
then, and I do to this day, that the leadership 
laboratory created by the Corps of Cadets at Texas

20:39.613 --> 20:57.880
A&M University is one which is predicated upon a 
group of people moving together through similar

20:39.613 --> 20:57.880
experiences, even though They may be in different 
undergraduate curriculum. Nonetheless, the

21:04.719 --> 21:20.442
movement together and the camaraderie that is 
developed during that leadership experience is

21:04.719 --> 21:20.442
vital for the Corps of Cadets' continued vitality 
as a part of Texas A&M University. I couldn't get

21:21.417 --> 21:22.358
that. I couldn't get that because I was trying to 
catch up with my buddies who were my age, if you

21:23.620 --> 21:29.489
will. And trying to frog into the Corps as a junior 
was not going to cut it. And so as a result, I opted

21:37.721 --> 21:42.608
not to be in the Corps of Cadets. But as I kidded all 
of my colleagues later when I became student body

21:42.628 --> 21:50.800
president, I was nonetheless commander in chief, 
which included the Corps of Cadets. OK, who were

21:51.927 --> 22:03.886
the advisors, teachers, et cetera, that helped to 
get you involved in A&M leadership experiences?

22:04.887 --> 22:06.730
Well, actually, there weren't any folks involved 
in that. It was sort of like,

22:08.833 --> 22:19.470
I guess, what one would consider sort of expected 
of me, and I sort of expected it of myself. And so it

22:20.750 --> 22:26.378
was really sort of weird because, let me see how I 
describe this, if I can get these dates and times

22:20.750 --> 22:26.378
right. In the fall of 1973,

22:28.120 --> 22:37.854
we had freshman senator elections. And I chose to 
run for freshman College of Agriculture senator.

22:46.872 --> 22:52.985
But it was basically amongst the folks in the class 
of 1977 as opposed to 76 because I had been out for a

22:46.872 --> 22:52.985
year. And I didn't really need a whole lot of 
encouragement in that regard. And secondly, I had

22:58.577 --> 23:05.893
a pretty good likely voter base in my favor because 
of the decision as to who is freshman agriculture

23:06.464 --> 23:17.640
senator is made by freshman College of 
Agriculture majors, many of whom I had known for

23:06.464 --> 23:17.640
four or five years because of my involvement in 
FFA. So it was sort of a pretty easy choice.

23:20.925 --> 23:30.660
Ironically, though, I had to relinquish that 
position six weeks later, or three weeks later,

23:20.925 --> 23:30.660
whatever it was, when I dropped out of school. When 
I came back to school in the fall of 1974,

23:35.962 --> 23:50.902
In the spring of 1975, when normal student body 
elections were held, I ran for, it was really sort

23:35.962 --> 23:50.902
of hard to figure out which one I was supposed to run 
for because my hours were really sort of screwed

23:35.962 --> 23:50.902
up, and I ran for College of Agriculture. What did I 
have? I think I had enough hours to be a sophomore.

23:56.590 --> 23:59.034
So I think it was sophomore. In the spring of 75, and 
I was elected from the College of Agriculture. Did

24:06.016 --> 24:07.698
you campaign? Not really. You didn't go around and 
shake hands? No, I didn't go around and shake

24:10.621 --> 24:11.962
hands. I didn't do any of those things. It was sort 
of like go to a couple of the College of Agriculture

24:13.263 --> 24:23.794
meetings like the Collegiate FFA or the Animal 
Science, I mean the Saddle and Sirloin Bunch or

24:13.263 --> 24:23.794
whatever. But basically I had a lot of friends 
spreading the word. We put up some flyers and, you

24:26.377 --> 24:29.460
know, that's sort of it. So I was elected in the 
spring to be a member of, the Senate from the

24:35.260 --> 24:53.101
College of Agriculture and at the end of that 
spring of 75 that new group elects officers for the

24:35.260 --> 24:53.101
following year within or at the time within the 
Senate and I ran for Speaker of the Student Senate

24:35.260 --> 24:53.101
and was elected Speaker in 75. So that would be for 
your Junior year. Basically. It really never got

25:00.624 --> 25:14.359
straight because that was, I guess I served as 
speaker during the fall of 1975 in the academic

25:00.624 --> 25:14.359
year of 75, 76. And it was at the end of or in the 
spring of 1976 that I ran for student body

25:15.200 --> 25:23.168
president and was elected in April of that year. 
And I served as student body president the 76-77

25:27.927 --> 25:37.422
academic year, but I actually graduated and 
received my undergraduate degree in December of

25:27.927 --> 25:37.422
1976. Now that's another one too, but this is 
another Dr. Potts story. It was sort of like,

25:41.749 --> 25:52.787
during that time, and I'll just spring back and 
forth on these and we can clean them up later, but

25:41.749 --> 25:52.787
during that time, graduating seniors did not have 
to take finals. assuming you were passing at that

25:53.037 --> 25:55.700
time. And so you basically finished your last 
round of quizzes like in November around about

25:56.281 --> 26:01.607
Thanksgiving. And so I was kind of done and having a 
great time hanging out at College Station,

26:02.588 --> 26:12.519
bothering all of my friends and keeping them from 
studying those who were not graduating in

26:02.588 --> 26:12.519
December. And during, let's see, that year I was 
also serving as chairman of the sportsmanship

26:12.539 --> 26:22.690
committee for the Southwest Conference Athletic 
Association. The guy who was then Corps commander

26:27.608 --> 26:33.295
who actually succeeded me as student body 
president was a guy named Robert Harvey. And Bob

26:33.996 --> 26:53.419
and I sort of became good friends because I made a 
concerted effort during my tenure as student body

26:33.996 --> 26:53.419
president to reach out to the Corps, again going 
back to those things I said earlier about the

26:33.996 --> 26:53.419
vibrancy of the university and its heart and soul 
and how the Corps of Cadets provides a tremendous

26:53.855 --> 26:56.239
boost in that regard. And I had to come present the 
sportsmanship committee here at the Cotton Bowl.

27:03.010 --> 27:05.634
Yet A&M was playing Florida in the Sun Bowl. And so 
Bob and I came up here first, kind of did the thing at

27:06.255 --> 27:16.692
the Cotton Bowl, and then we went out to El Paso, did 
the Sun Bowl, and went back to a basketball game at

27:06.255 --> 27:16.692
College Station, ironically. So we made a big old 
tour of Texas. But sometime during that time

27:18.575 --> 27:20.638
frame, and it's like, I guess because of the energy 
crisis, school was starting later. I believe we

27:25.385 --> 27:30.291
had taken a longer break for Christmas, New Year's 
recess. And I'm kind of like hanging out finally

27:31.413 --> 27:37.220
and getting ready to come back down here. And I get 
this phone call from Dr. Potts. And it's like out of

27:40.865 --> 27:43.809
clear blue, we're doing the holidays. And I said, 
Dr. Potts, how you doing? Blah, blah, blah. Have a

27:46.112 --> 27:46.793
good holiday. Get through all of the 
pleasantries. And he says, Fred, do you enjoy

27:48.415 --> 27:50.878
being student vice president? And I said, I love 
it, Dr. Potts, you know, it's going to come to an end

27:51.398 --> 27:57.368
here in the spring, but yeah, I love it. He goes, 
well, do you realize that to be student body

27:57.528 --> 28:02.116
president, you have to be enrolled as a student? 
And I said, yeah. He goes, well, didn't you just

28:04.380 --> 28:06.584
graduate in December? Well, yeah, I did. He says, 
well, like, how are you going to be a student in the

28:07.285 --> 28:09.849
spring? You know, so like, oh. So as a result, I was 
immediately enrolled into college. the graduate

28:16.913 --> 28:27.826
program in agricultural economics, seeking an MS 
degree so that I could be a student while I finished

28:16.913 --> 28:27.826
my term as student vice president. Thanks to Dr. 
Potts, I didn't get sort of removed from office for

28:27.866 --> 28:33.974
lack of being a student. So again, one of the great, 
unique, wonderful things about the

28:34.114 --> 28:43.866
relationships between students and professors 
going up to the dean's office and, of course,

28:44.420 --> 28:52.334
ultimately into the administration, higher vice 
presidents and presidents. Were it not for that

28:52.394 --> 29:09.904
kind of attention that was paid to all students, 
not just those of us who happen to be involved in

28:52.394 --> 29:09.904
leadership positions within the student 
government or whatever, or on campus in other

28:52.394 --> 29:09.904
student leadership roles, that thing is that 
which is most unique. And now I'm talking about a

29:10.492 --> 29:25.469
time frame when our university had been the 
fastest growing state public institution in the

29:10.492 --> 29:25.469
country for the previous two years and what had 
been 14,000 students that I mentioned earlier was

29:10.492 --> 29:25.469
now 28,000 students. But that personal 
relationship stuff continued and that's very

29:25.709 --> 29:31.957
unique and very special. Why do you think it was 
growing so fast right then? I think it was growing

29:36.422 --> 29:38.524
quickly then for Oh, I think the primary reason was 
that all of a sudden, uh, Texas A&M, uh, did not have

29:39.922 --> 29:56.356
as much of an agrarian, uh, image. And that image 
was changing. Frankly, I'd seen that changing

29:58.578 --> 30:08.967
though, even going back to my days in FFA, you know, 
at the time that I was national FFA secretary, the

29:58.578 --> 30:08.967
largest FFA chapter in the country. was in 
downtown Los Angeles. It was horticulture

30:13.028 --> 30:22.559
programs, except these guys not only had 
horticulture, but they also had an acre where they

30:13.028 --> 30:22.559
raised cattle in downtown, which is the most 
unusual experience. But there was a huge shift

30:22.579 --> 30:25.002
going on in the agribusiness side. Of course, the 
College of Agriculture was still, along with the

30:25.042 --> 30:34.252
College of Engineering, sort of the largest two 
colleges within the university during that time

30:25.042 --> 30:34.252
frame. And as the ag programs began to shift, What 
happened was that I think

30:38.157 --> 30:55.613
the image that A&M had previously had, which was 
like all corps and all military and straight, pure

30:38.157 --> 30:55.613
agriculture, farm boys and girls, was changing. 
In addition, females started coming to school.

30:59.837 --> 31:00.958
And that was the other factor. I may be going out on a 
limb, but I am going to guess that Probably during

31:06.980 --> 31:24.006
my last year, and of course these numbers can be 
found, but I'm going to say, you know, we

31:06.980 --> 31:24.006
didn't have just a whole lot of females at college 
even in 1976. See, Williams made the board agree

31:24.086 --> 31:34.202
before he accepted the job that he could take an 
existing dormitory And on January 1, 1971,
