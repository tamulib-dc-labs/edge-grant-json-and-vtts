WEBVTT

00:03.895 --> 00:09.285
Because you took him to a track meet.

00:09.626 --> 00:14.676
At a school which he didn't think that he had the 
talent or the means to go to. And I've followed him

00:15.778 --> 00:20.527
all these years and still keep in touch with him. 
And then you think of the number of people he

00:20.647 --> 00:25.296
changed. and all. So it's been just a lot of 
instances. And there's been other kids that I have

00:31.510 --> 00:34.835
spotted in high school. One from Giddings over 
here that I told Cheryl about. He ended up playing

00:41.545 --> 00:42.826
here. There's been several others that I... I got 
one guy a scholarship at Iowa State through Jim

00:46.932 --> 00:51.539
Myers the one year he was there. He ended up Going 
there and doing well. It's been really a lot of fun.

01:02.944 --> 01:08.918
Who were your favorite coaches or other athletic 
department people here? Well, of course, Wally

01:10.687 --> 01:17.857
has been, Wally Groff has been really good to me 
over the years and has treated me very, very well. I

01:19.620 --> 01:20.621
enjoyed Shelby. I enjoyed Tony Barone, and I got 
along real well with Jackie. I was real, and I have a

01:25.808 --> 01:35.822
real good relationship with RC, the track people, 
because I've gotten real heavily into track these

01:25.808 --> 01:35.822
past few years now. I announced track meets from 
the middle of February until the middle of May. And

01:41.838 --> 01:48.987
I guess one of the things I'm most proud of, I'm the 
Baylor track announcer now. I have been now for

01:49.027 --> 01:50.449
three years. I didn't know you had sold out. Gone to 
Baylor. They called and asked, and so I go. Do you

02:00.822 --> 02:02.424
still do track here? Yes. Oh, yes. Let's see. When 
you became the track announcer, who was the coach?

02:10.272 --> 02:11.814
Charlie Thomas. Charlie Thomas. I've only known 
two track coaches here, Charlie Thomas and Ted

02:12.875 --> 02:15.998
Nelson. Describe those two. Make believe

02:17.740 --> 02:22.404
that somebody didn't know them. Charlie Thomas is 
somebody that if you knew he was in a burning

02:22.424 --> 02:28.571
building, you'd dash in to get him because you 
wouldn't be sure he'd go out on his own. Charlie

02:30.993 --> 02:34.677
doesn't really get very excited about anything. 
But he was a good track coach. I disagreed with him

02:39.393 --> 02:48.587
for a period of time when he was doing what the 
majority of people were doing. The University of

02:48.647 --> 02:52.513
Texas was doing it even worse than we were, 
bringing in sub-quality academic students

02:53.135 --> 03:16.594
running them for a semester and then run them off to 
a junior college to get them re-eligible and and

02:53.135 --> 03:16.594
going back we're never getting anywhere near any 
kind of a degree program with them but that of

02:53.135 --> 03:16.594
course is all turned around now we don't in fact we 
don't have anybody going to junior college as i

02:53.135 --> 03:16.594
know of now ted has worked real hard to try to build a 
program he just has been unable to recruit

03:16.895 --> 03:29.895
against, particularly against the University of 
Texas overall, and against Baylor in middle

03:16.895 --> 03:29.895
distance runners. You just can't get them. And 
he's tried real hard. We've got some. But we're

03:38.107 --> 03:40.891
doing a little better now. Dave Hartman, who we 
brought in two years ago as a long-distance coach,

03:40.931 --> 03:47.861
is doing real, real well at attracting athletes. 
And so we're going to see some changes. Of all the

03:50.825 --> 04:01.060
coaches and all the sports that you have known 
here, to which one would you give the highest mark

03:50.825 --> 04:01.060
given what they had to work with? Who did the best 
job with what they had to work with, whether they

04:01.080 --> 04:06.628
won championships or not?

04:16.902 --> 04:20.387
It's hard to beat Tom Chandler's record. I don't 
know. He didn't have that many guys go to the pros.

04:25.354 --> 04:27.217
But they consistently won. Mark has done a good 
job. He's gotten a lot of guys in the pros. I

04:33.546 --> 04:44.783
think a couple of years, RC has done a real good job. 
And a couple of years, Shelby did a real good job.

04:51.936 --> 04:53.539
And again, I'm not going to ask the negative. Which 
one do you think of all the coaches here had the most

04:53.559 --> 05:01.633
spotless record in terms of their adhering to the 
rules? Who followed the rules most closely?

05:12.843 --> 05:13.704
people over there. I don't know those things. 
Which of the coaches here would you have wanted to

05:21.155 --> 05:30.608
coach one of your children and to have had an effect 
on their life values? Mark Johnson.

05:37.999 --> 05:38.700
Unquestionably. I was asked that question by the 
Iowa State President Martin Jischke before he

05:42.695 --> 05:50.591
hired Tim Floyd as the basketball coach because I 
knew Tim real well at UTEP. He and his wife sit on our

05:50.611 --> 05:53.196
P of the church. I knew him as a husband and a father 
of a church-goer and an assistant coach. Thirty

05:59.809 --> 06:01.152
minutes of questions. I'm standing...

07:33.783 --> 07:42.031
The baseball, they've all been just really, 
really super. And Jim Koch. First time I met Jim

07:46.116 --> 07:50.980
Koch,

07:46.116 --> 07:50.980
Fremont.

07:56.426 --> 08:02.372
Describe the press box facilities in football 
when you started. and when compare them with what

08:04.107 --> 08:32.123
was there when you retired well the the format

08:04.107 --> 08:32.123
isn't all that different bigger than what was only 
it was only two levels instead of three

08:04.107 --> 08:32.123
electronically yes i mean it was strung out the 
same way there was two levels and then of course

09:27.217 --> 09:32.113
this

09:27.217 --> 09:32.113
for you

11:30.151 --> 11:30.495
Thank you.

15:47.461 --> 15:53.147
It bothers me that he has really not received the 
credit. One time said, people here don't realize

15:55.289 --> 16:16.129
what RC All right,

15:55.289 --> 16:16.129
we were talking about athletics, and you're still 
doing what in athletics? Football and track. And

16:17.802 --> 16:21.045
so you've been doing football for how long? Well, 
my first full year was the fall of 69 as announcer.

16:31.015 --> 16:34.598
And my first year outdoors in the stadium was 77. 
And track? Probably track announcing goes back to

16:38.582 --> 16:41.865
about 73 or 74. Now, you did not overlap with C.K. 
Astin. Well, I replaced him. All right, so were you

16:50.003 --> 16:56.404
here when he... Yeah, I was doing a press box when 
he... All right, describe some C.K. Esten

16:56.424 --> 16:57.166
stories. I don't have any. You're kidding. No, I 
had no contact with him at all. I'd see him and

17:01.246 --> 17:03.150
that's it. You weren't there when he forgot to turn 
the machine off? No. No, that was before I got

17:07.498 --> 17:08.961
there. I remember hearing that. Yeah. No, that was 
before my time. I've heard about it. CK didn't come

17:15.855 --> 17:19.602
near me and I didn't go near him. And then the last 
couple of years, he was really quite annoyed

17:19.885 --> 17:29.342
because every time Jack Gammon had something he 
wanted read, he'd let me go up and read it. Oh, and

17:30.965 --> 17:31.946
that frustrated him? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, because 
that was his territory.

17:38.959 --> 17:43.767
Has anybody ever attempted to tell you how to do 
something differently in a

17:53.770 --> 17:55.883
Mike Caruso protected me in volleyball. They 
wanted a change, and he said, well, get another

17:56.667 --> 18:01.114
announcer, because he said, I'm not going to ask 
him to change. Okay. Why did they want to change in

18:03.459 --> 18:07.723
basketball and volleyball? This thing with PA 
announcers now of hoopla is just, as far as I'm

18:08.044 --> 18:15.130
concerned, is just destroying sports. I don't see 
any place for it, and it's even creeping into

18:15.391 --> 18:19.214
football now. The guy at Kansas State is one of the 
worst. But it's getting into football. I'm

18:24.319 --> 18:29.003
fearful that they're coming to tell me that they 
want something different, but hopefully not.

18:30.144 --> 18:30.865
Because I just think I still believe in fairness in 
athletics. The guy with the public address

18:36.951 --> 18:42.036
system,

18:36.951 --> 18:42.036
he's got the . He's the

18:42.056 --> 18:45.419
. And I just don't think that that's equal and fair. 
Now, the National Football League has some real

18:49.243 --> 18:51.865
strong . They're not

18:51.885 --> 18:59.873
holding you.

19:03.869 --> 19:27.784
uh... credit

19:03.869 --> 19:27.784
uh...

19:34.025 --> 19:49.384
bucket and uh... that he was all british

19:34.025 --> 19:49.384
uh... it uh...

19:52.604 --> 20:01.618
Fred

19:52.604 --> 20:01.618
has an encyclopedia of information. I don't know 
how anybody can research the way he does. He's got

20:05.424 --> 20:07.126
stacks and stacks. He knows every athlete that's 
playing and what they did since they started

20:07.306 --> 20:11.433
playing Little League. I, for some reason or 
other, think that when you're at a college event,

20:17.950 --> 20:20.595
then what they achieved in high school is no longer 
of value. But at track meets particularly, he goes

20:21.477 --> 20:28.551
down every high school meet that they ran in. And of 
course, there's a lot of dead time at track meets,

20:28.611 --> 20:34.643
but it's not all bad. Do you have any ideal role 
model announcers from either the past or the

20:34.623 --> 20:46.463
present? The only man that I ever listened to that I 
really tried to follow was an old man who did the

20:46.483 --> 20:56.479
Chicago Cubs for years and years and years named 
Pat Piper. And he sat on a chair down behind home

20:57.033 --> 20:59.436
plate. He didn't even sit in the press box. And all 
he did was introduce the batter and then change the

21:01.479 --> 21:08.790
pitchers, and that's it. And that's pretty much 
what I've tried to do. And Dave South changed me, oh

21:11.975 --> 21:20.627
gosh, I suppose it's five years ago now. When they 
built that new scoreboard, they paid good money.

21:26.914 --> 21:30.037
So advertisers paid good money for that. And Dave 
said, we want them to have to look at the

21:30.097 --> 21:32.540
scoreboard. So he said, just tell who carried the 
ball, who made the tackle, and that's it. Don't

21:37.906 --> 21:41.470
tell the yardage or anything unless they make over 
10 yards and go. And don't need to tell them it's

21:42.131 --> 21:43.732
first down. They can look at the scoreboard and 
tell it's first down. So I cut back a lot of what I've

21:46.015 --> 21:50.580
done, and I like it. You know, you get tired of 
listening to people after a while. And so many

21:54.245 --> 21:56.248
times they're late. And so if you just tell who's 
carrying the ball, who made the tackle, then get

21:56.969 --> 22:03.519
off and wait for the next play. Substitutions, you 
can't keep up with them. There's no point in

22:06.884 --> 22:07.925
trying. Back in the days when you had limited 
substitution or unlimited, or really no

22:08.486 --> 22:16.838
substitute at all, if there was a substitute, you 
could get him in the game. I remember seeing the

22:16.818 --> 22:23.810
last game that Niall Kinnick played at the 
University of Iowa in 1939. Iowa used 13 players

22:24.511 --> 22:26.294
that day. All right, now, this was your avocation, 
your enjoyment routine. Let's go back to

22:37.072 --> 22:39.075
veterinary medicine. Describe how your task, 
your assignment, change if it did in all the years

22:44.138 --> 22:49.668
you were a faculty member? Once I got into 
diagnostic pathology, I found a home. I'm a great

22:56.981 --> 23:01.810
why man. You never do know why, but you always wish 
you did. And so I found it a challenge to, and very

23:07.429 --> 23:19.144
interesting to see the changes and to try to 
interpret the changes that you see. And it was

23:19.184 --> 23:30.379
really a, really a, and plus it has such a broader 
spectrum.

23:31.523 --> 23:39.754
When you treat same

23:31.523 --> 23:39.754
thing every day. You began this diagnostic in the 
70s? When did you say? In 65 when I came here. I got

23:47.884 --> 23:48.906
into diagnostic. And of course, I had done I

23:49.226 --> 23:56.856
mean, again, or not fit to eat based on what you see 
and that I got a real tremendous exposure to

23:58.777 --> 24:09.715
disease, the changes disease can produce in 
animals and then having to decide whether that

24:10.235 --> 24:19.147
change could be removed just by excoriation or 
whether it was affecting the entire carcass. And I

24:19.167 --> 24:23.213
really found it to be exciting. And this was for all 
sorts of animals? Well, in meat inspection, I

24:26.577 --> 24:34.588
started out in poultry with turkeys and chickens, 
and then I switched to cattle and sheep. and hogs.

24:35.790 --> 24:48.266
And then when I got here in veterinary school and 
also in Auburn as well, then you're doing the whole

24:35.790 --> 24:48.266
thing, a whole range of small animals, various 
breeds of small animals, cattle. We didn't have a

24:50.469 --> 24:54.494
lot of exotic animals come through postmortem 
when I was there, but we'd have some. Now this was a

24:55.936 --> 25:03.085
formal course for fourth year students? Pretty 
much so, yes. Here, yes. normally how many

25:04.522 --> 25:09.530
students would be in each class? Well, when you get 
down to the clinical years now, in post-mortem, of

25:10.551 --> 25:22.830
course, I hadn't worked in post-mortem since 75. I 
went to clinical pathology in 75. But we would have

25:25.674 --> 25:27.998
between six and eight in a group. Would they 
rotate? Did you have all the members in the class in

25:29.854 --> 25:33.198
the semester? Yes. And describe what your week 
routine in those classes would be. Were you there

25:41.730 --> 25:43.132
all day, every day? This

25:43.172 --> 25:48.720
would be about 72 or 73. Bridges switched me over to 
teaching the pathology course to the seniors in

25:49.088 --> 25:55.016
biomedical science. And this was a laboratory 
course that had, when we first started, it had six

25:55.597 --> 26:02.406
hours of lab, one hour of lecture, and then we added 
another hour of lecture. So it was six hours of lab,

26:02.426 --> 26:04.669
two hours of lecture a week. And I had two sections. 
So this filled up my time pretty well. But I would

26:08.794 --> 26:17.526
still spend one day a week in the diagnostics lab 
over in the small animal clinic, above the small

26:08.794 --> 26:17.526
animal clinic. working over there. But I had 12 
hours of laboratory a week in class, plus two hours

26:19.191 --> 26:33.169
of lecture, and this really kept me busy. describe 
those biomedical science students? This is

26:38.790 --> 26:45.809
probably an Al Price, I think everybody's 
forgotten the fact that Al Price started this. And

26:46.571 --> 26:49.639
when he first started it, he started it to produce

26:55.846 --> 27:04.026
A whole bunch of junior started veterinary 
assistant programs and the Texas in Waco started

26:55.846 --> 27:04.026
one. And they were much easier to get into and much 
easier to get out of than what the four-year degree

27:05.329 --> 27:12.606
program here was. And what has evolved though now 
here on the campus is that it is essentially the

27:13.902 --> 27:27.322
pre-medical study curriculum for all areas of 
medicine. Dentistry, medicine, human medicine,

27:28.464 --> 27:34.493
podiatry,

27:36.987 --> 27:44.774
They've got now nearly 2,000 majors in the 
biomedical science program. It is just awesome.

27:48.017 --> 27:48.637
Are they good students? Yes, yes. They tend to go 
somewhere in the medical field and know going in

27:49.978 --> 28:00.448
that academically they even start. Urban or rural 
in background? Oh, mostly urban. Mostly urban

28:04.611 --> 28:05.492
now. I

28:07.598 --> 28:14.106
think I can best sum that up, and I can't think of the 
man's last name. I can't even think of his first

28:14.166 --> 28:15.448
name now. The guy, ex-CIA director, not CIA 
director, an ex-CIA agent. Yes, sir. Jim Wilson.

28:24.759 --> 28:29.245
Spoke to our Methodist church yesterday. I think 
CIA recruits more students from Texas A&M than any

28:30.326 --> 28:36.053
other place in the country. because of the quality 
that they are. They're the type of people that they

28:41.908 --> 28:46.759
can trust and can use. And I feel pretty much that 
that typifies our premedical people as well.

29:05.463 --> 29:09.728
Nothing other than that they were able to complete 
the curriculum and are now successful.

29:16.395 --> 29:31.251
Scott, who's a Hispanic boy named Jaime Sanchez 
from out in West Texas somewhere, an MCAT score

29:16.395 --> 29:31.251
high enough to get into any medical school, but he 
got into the

29:33.475 --> 29:34.176
real well. I don't know where Jaime is now, but he 
just did real well. The three years that George

29:41.508 --> 29:53.728
Shelton let me be chairman of the selection 
committee in the veterinary school, I got a chance

29:41.508 --> 29:53.728
to introduce what I believe is the method of choice 
for selecting anybody for that matter is that you

29:55.953 --> 30:24.323
take all the information that they give you as far 
as their prerequisites and everything is

29:55.953 --> 30:24.323
concerned and then you start picking them on the 
number from the top down I want this one I want this

29:55.953 --> 30:24.323
one I want this one and when you get your quota 
filled You tell the rest of them, I ran out of space.

30:29.963 --> 30:32.467
You don't tell them why you ran out of space or 
anything else. You have just selected people in

30:32.827 --> 30:39.077
which you believe they will do what you want them to 
do in the way you want it done. And when you get

30:39.117 --> 30:42.502
through with that number, you have to quit. What 
would be the key factors in your rankings of those

30:43.444 --> 30:49.433
students?

30:55.133 --> 30:55.714
I'm sorry? Overall interest in life. Why am I here? 
What do I want to do? What do I hope to do? What have I

31:01.625 --> 31:02.326
done? What have I done to make myself better? How do 
you quantify that? Brown University, I read this

31:07.937 --> 31:15.291
thing on Brown University several years ago, that 
Brown University rejects more students. At that

31:15.471 --> 31:18.677
time, they rejected more students with SAT 
scores.
