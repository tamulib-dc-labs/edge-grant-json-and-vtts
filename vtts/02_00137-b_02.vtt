To me, Texas A&M is a marvelous sum of the accomplishments of various individuals.

00:12.456 --> 00:17.441
You and I are familiar with the difference that Earl Rutter made here.

00:17.541 --> 00:19.323
Terrific, yes.

00:19.623 --> 00:21.826
And a few others.

00:22.927 --> 00:27.392
Let's conclude, unless you have any other thoughts, let's conclude with this question.

00:28.233 --> 00:33.278
What feelings do you have for Texas A&M in your heart today?

00:34.625 --> 00:35.826
Well, they're good feelings.

00:36.527 --> 00:56.126
I've always felt that A&M was a practical school, that the students here were sort of the type that make it on their own, that are used to earning their living and doing useful things.

00:59.389 --> 01:00.430
I think the

01:02.047 --> 01:05.092
the quality of the students, the relationships.

01:06.114 --> 01:20.557
In my days, I felt that the entire alumni had the good relationships equivalent to those that you would have had in a fraternity in another university, that this entire student body had that feeling.

01:21.198 --> 01:24.443
And I gather that a lot of it is still here, that the personal

01:25.486 --> 01:34.778
connection between the administration and all of the activities and the students must be about the best in the country, in spite of the size.

01:35.679 --> 01:39.283
And that's real hard to obtain, but once an Aggie, always an Aggie.

01:40.004 --> 01:45.551
And if you see one anyplace, you can tell certain things about him.

01:45.732 --> 01:51.519
He's willing to make out on his own, not expecting favors from anybody.

01:53.101 --> 01:54.683
And the word is spreading.

01:55.270 --> 02:03.579
In Eugene, Oregon, we went into a thrift shop, and I saw a baseball cap, and on the front of the baseball cap, Sea Aggie, S-E-A, Sea Aggie.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.365
So I guess that was the Maritime Academy ship dropped in someplace.

02:09.385 --> 02:19.455
No, I think Aggie does have a spirit, and that it's persisted in spite of the growth, which is quite an accomplishment, and it's something you can be proud to be associated with.
