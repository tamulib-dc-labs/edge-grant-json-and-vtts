00:04.199 --> 00:06.002
Testing, testing, testing. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 
Going on a little more.

00:19.807 --> 00:21.550
Wednesday.

00:35.182 --> 00:56.582
Well,

00:35.182 --> 00:56.582
I was born in Chicago and reared on one side. My dad 
was a cell phone company. My mother was a

01:01.377 --> 01:02.639
homemaker. I had two other brothers. I went to New 
Church High School.

01:11.409 --> 01:12.010
Left my house. Got to hitchhike every day. And then 
went to school first through second.

01:25.891 --> 01:29.215
I went to Ohio State, made my grades there, and went 
on to Ohio State. I graduated from there, and then I

01:29.235 --> 01:31.498
worked for my rich uncle, Sam, for two years in 
Germany. And fortunately,

01:31.518 --> 01:51.942
I didn't have to go to Vietnam, but that was the time 
that I was going. And I came back, and I was married,

01:51.962 --> 01:52.943
had two sons. I worked in the golf region, Calgary. 
I

01:54.629 --> 02:22.780
really didn't. I

02:23.148 --> 02:35.719
was thinking about being a pet, and I'm not very 
good at math and chemistry, so I kind of struggled

02:23.148 --> 02:35.719
with that. I really didn't know what I wanted to do, 
and I became attached to it with golf. But

02:37.542 --> 03:02.267
I knew I wanted to get involved with it.

03:07.546 --> 03:18.363
And

03:07.546 --> 03:18.363
he had a defined program, I know. Yes, he did. 
Right. Now, how did you and A&M get connected?

03:23.130 --> 03:24.532
Through labor. They called him, and they were 
looking for Marvin Tate. was

03:28.758 --> 03:50.925
the assistant athletic director. His memory was 
in as large as a football player's athletic

03:50.945 --> 03:52.307
director. And his memory gave Marvin the 
responsibility to hire a counselor. And so we

03:53.669 --> 03:54.990
called up Lavin and asked him if he knew any 
counselors. Lavin and I were very close. My father

03:55.591 --> 03:56.172
had a school there. He was really kind to me, and my 
father listened to him. after

03:57.682 --> 04:20.905
i graduated and he called me up i know what it was So

04:21.340 --> 04:47.010
I went out. And

04:47.665 --> 05:04.608
when I went out there that summer, this was about 
the end of that summer. He said, Texas A&M, we're

05:04.628 --> 05:05.569
looking for a doctor. And I told him, I'm going to 
see a doctor. I really need a doctor. So I was kind of

05:06.931 --> 05:08.273
thinking, oh, Texas A&M, I'm looking for a doctor. 
Well,

05:08.742 --> 05:25.857
I want to do it, so I'm on my way back. Wonderful

05:26.866 --> 05:51.507
guy.

05:59.806 --> 06:02.651
Yes, he was. Marvin did the day-to-day. This is 
what year? This is 1974.

06:13.049 --> 06:14.592
Describe the interview process. Well, Marvin and 
I basically drove around. He showed me that we had

06:20.866 --> 06:27.544
this guy working over at the golf course that was 
not very friendly. I don't want to say his name.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.698
There will be people here that will know it. said 
that uh no he didn't even drive

06:33.235 --> 06:59.648
by and show me the golf course we just uh inside of 
course showed him of course a little bit and i'm

06:33.235 --> 06:59.648
like you're not the briar because he drove by fort 
auburn and he'd go by every big home he'd be fine you

06:33.235 --> 06:59.648
know we just talked as that was basically the end 
and then we went to uh he brought me by and i met his

06:33.235 --> 06:59.648
wife at the house and then we came back and we ate And 
then he brought me in to meet Emory. And Emory and I

07:03.761 --> 07:06.343
talked finances. And he asked me what I needed, and 
I told him. And he said, well, that's a little high.

07:11.688 --> 07:13.409
And I said, well, that's what I need. He asked me, 
and that's what I need. And when you have a job, it's

07:15.151 --> 07:19.034
a lot easier to look for another one. And he said, 
well, we'll let you know. And that was in June, and

07:22.317 --> 07:25.941
they offered it to me in July. All right. Did you get 
the impression that you were one of a number? Not at

07:30.745 --> 07:50.199
that time, but subsequently I found out that there 
was Mike Holder, who's presently at Oklahoma

07:30.745 --> 07:50.199
State, and a very successful coach, and also Jimmy 
Clayton, who lives in Texas, who had a lot of

07:30.745 --> 07:50.199
success, too. They were key advocates for the job. 
Now, I'm not going to ask for money, but what was the

07:50.960 --> 07:52.342
bid? It was $14,000. And did you have a budget 
beyond that? Yes, they did. Do you remember what

07:59.893 --> 08:02.737
the... Oh, gosh. In round numbers? I would say 
probably $60,000. And you were replacing whom?

08:08.866 --> 08:09.627
Henry Ransom. And he'd been here a long, long time. 
Well, yeah, he'd been here for a while, and then he

08:12.431 --> 08:23.567
got out, and Joe Fagan was a coach for a while, and 
Henry was before Joe, so... Actually, Joe was

08:23.885 --> 08:38.486
sandwiched

08:23.885 --> 08:38.486
by him for a number of years. Well, I was just so 
excited to even think about getting a job. It could

08:41.510 --> 08:44.795
have just been a putt-putt, and I would have been 
excited. But I walked out on the college golf

08:44.815 --> 08:47.479
course, and they had just gone through a pretty big 
revamping process. R.E. Peterson, R.F.

08:51.393 --> 08:52.735
Peterson, who was at the border region, D. 
Peterson, R.F. Peterson, he had called in Jackie

08:52.755 --> 09:04.768
Burke, and Jackie went out and he did the golf 
course. And it looked rough, you know, from

09:05.629 --> 09:07.511
somebody's eye who didn't know golf course. But I 
could see, wow, this is a golf course. And

09:10.055 --> 09:28.248
he had designed it where there were just landing 
areas in the sea, and then there would be about 15

09:10.055 --> 09:28.248
yards each side of the fairway where it was hydro, 
and then it would get to another nation. And it was

09:28.268 --> 09:29.189
a... You'd go out and shoot 74, 75. It was a good one. 
And Hard Vessels was... I think he's head of

09:31.992 --> 09:33.955
business, I think. He was vice president of 
business. On campus, and the golf course was one of

09:35.797 --> 09:38.521
his responsibilities. And I remember him coming 
in. J.O. Adams was the head of the golf committee,

09:40.344 --> 09:44.830
of which I was a member. I remember Howard coming in 
and just begging, please let us mow the fairways.

09:51.319 --> 09:54.184
Because we can't see anybody play golf. Students 
are going out. They never had to pay much. They

09:57.997 --> 10:02.823
couldn't find the golf balls. And we weren't 
generating any money. And so Howard just begged

10:05.125 --> 10:09.030
for it to get permission to mold the fairways. And 
then eventually we molded them all down. And the

10:11.493 --> 10:14.156
redesign was pretty much lost. But, oh, and that 
first redesign came out. That thing was tough. And

10:17.660 --> 10:19.963
this is a great old golf course. There was a time 
here when they were going to go ahead and just tear

10:19.983 --> 10:23.667
it up and redo it. But this is a Ralph 
Plummer-designed golf course. Now, Ralph

10:26.351 --> 10:37.769
Plummer, he's a great architect, and I know one 
golf course he did that most everybody knows, and

10:26.351 --> 10:37.769
that's the Cypress Course in Champions, where 
they had the Tour Championship last year. They had

10:37.789 --> 10:39.591
the Ryder Cup. They had the National Amateur. They 
had the Southern Amateur. It's a great golf

10:41.975 --> 10:45.741
course. He designed it for that course and our 
course. And this thing is really beautiful.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.315
Well, when I arrived, there was, when I looked at 
the pictures,

11:24.059 --> 11:26.020
Father, please be with us.

19:22.347 --> 19:27.814
No, I think in that day, all the hiring forms 
eventually went to his desk. He's my favorite of

19:28.896 --> 19:32.020
all favorites. Oh, my gosh. Usually my voice 
breaks when I start talking

19:32.300 --> 19:40.211
to him. I got back yesterday to Mrs. Williams. I had

19:41.052 --> 19:45.277
two sessions with her. I got back to her. We were her 
friends, all of them, and we chatted on the phone.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.903
She said back at Clinton. They started out. How was 
it?

19:57.633 --> 20:00.436
to the same, never sold it. Back to old friends

20:00.456 --> 20:11.226
and everything. But he was so, so, so special. 
Surely you had some early experience in

20:13.208 --> 20:17.532
Aggieology, Aggie myths and legends. Share some 
experiences

20:17.893 --> 20:26.501
with us. Giggum.

20:31.855 --> 20:53.020
Mm-hmm.

31:14.708 --> 31:19.698
and was the conference tournament on a rotational 
basis then? Compared, we're still probably...
