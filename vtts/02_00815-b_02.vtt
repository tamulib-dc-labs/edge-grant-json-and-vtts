WEBVTT

00:01.178 --> 00:13.574
The

00:01.178 --> 00:13.574
campaign was on the heels of Sharpstown and at a 
time when the Speaker of the House was being tried

00:01.178 --> 00:13.574
for bribery in Abilene. I was going on during the 
political campaign.

00:22.646 --> 00:24.689
Legislators were running for cover. When I 
received a call, asking me if I would come to

00:28.803 --> 00:32.067
Abilene and testify. Even though I had a campaign 
and had opponents that would obviously make use of

00:32.087 --> 00:49.127
such a trip, I decided that I could not in good 
conscience say no. I made the trip to Abilene,

00:51.390 --> 00:55.975
arrived there one evening to find out that the 
defense had rested and decided to not call any

00:56.933 --> 01:02.100
witnesses. I never have understood why the 
defense rested in that case without calling

01:03.422 --> 01:13.556
witnesses, but that was the decision they made. 
Shortly after returning home, the

01:15.980 --> 01:26.755
jury found Speaker Butcher guilty of bribery and 
were prepared to sentence him. I then received a

01:31.332 --> 01:39.221
second call to please come back to Abilene and 
appear as a character witness. I did make a trip to

01:41.244 --> 01:48.952
Abilene and was prepared to appear as a character 
witness but was never called. The fact that I had

01:50.554 --> 01:55.780
made the trips to Abilene and even though there was 
no record of my appearing in Abilene, the election

01:56.249 --> 02:10.268
campaign got very nasty and every effort was made 
to link me with the Speaker. I think the biggest

02:12.391 --> 02:24.147
mistake I made was not getting the family together 
and explaining to them what was going on and why I

02:12.391 --> 02:24.147
was conducting myself as I was. that even the older 
children did not understand all the mudslinging

02:24.937 --> 02:31.644
and name-calling that was taking place. Recall 
one evening, we're sitting down to dinner, my

02:32.866 --> 02:52.868
five-year-old daughter came in and said, Daddy, 
that man is back on TV again saying, where was Bill

02:32.866 --> 02:52.868
Presnell when he was supposed to be

02:55.852 --> 02:59.737
her hands on her hips and was very indignant about 
it all.

03:03.101 --> 03:06.425
Changed her expression finally to say, where were 
you, Daddy? That particular attack had nothing to

03:08.187 --> 03:18.800
do with Sharpstown, but had everything to do with 
the fact that a special session was called during

03:08.187 --> 03:18.800
the political campaign. And at a time when I had a 
commitment to be at a barbecue that was given in my

03:25.383 --> 03:40.979
honor, Robertson

03:25.383 --> 03:40.979
County, a county which had been newly added to the 
district. The fact was that I had stayed in Austin

03:42.641 --> 03:51.070
until late that afternoon and made arrangements 
for a friend to pick me up in his airplane. But I

03:52.990 --> 04:03.006
could get the details of some legislation worked 
out before leaving the Capitol. Same opponent was

04:05.270 --> 04:16.568
running an ad in the newspaper each day for about 30 
days that simply said, why did Preston go to

04:05.270 --> 04:16.568
Abilene? In the meantime, the Dirty Thirty was 
supporting another candidate that I had as an

04:18.218 --> 04:24.528
opponent. And I recall one evening at a political 
rally when he pointed out that the Dirty Thirty was

04:26.250 --> 04:39.671
supporting him and his candidacy to defeat me for 
reelection. I followed up to point out that the

04:41.033 --> 04:45.981
leader of the Dirty Thirty was the person who had 
passed a resolution to commend the Boston

04:46.163 --> 04:50.490
Strangler. A campaign year when it was throw the 
rascals out and I feel very fortunate that I

04:52.654 --> 05:10.062
survived the campaign with two opponents without 
having to face a runoff. have a special session

05:11.003 --> 05:26.045
later that year after the campaigns were over, and 
at that session on the first day, Speaker Murcher

05:11.003 --> 05:26.045
resigned from his post as Speaker of the House. 
This meant that we had to elect a new Speaker, and

05:27.387 --> 05:40.285
the test was between Rayford Price and DeWitt 
Hale. I chose to support Rayford Price because we

05:41.598 --> 06:03.965
all knew that DeWitt Hale was merely a stand-in for 
the interim so that Price Daniel Jr. could be

05:41.598 --> 06:03.965
elected speaker come 19 January 1973 for the 
regular session. Price Daniel Jr. did not want to

06:06.843 --> 06:15.335
run the risk of being defeated in this election 
that was held during the special session. The

06:16.616 --> 06:33.660
Constitution requires that a speaker be elected 
at the convening of each regular session of the

06:16.616 --> 06:33.660
legislature unless there's a vacancy and then of 
course there has to be an election to fill the

06:16.616 --> 06:33.660
vacancy. In a close election, Rayford Price was 
elected Speaker, but was later defeated in his

06:34.754 --> 07:01.133
campaign for re-election by Fred Head, who

06:34.754 --> 07:01.133
he had been paired with in

06:34.754 --> 07:01.133
the redistricting process.

07:03.391 --> 07:13.962
The defeat of Rayford Price threw the doors wide 
open for Price Daniel Jr. to be elected speaker

07:03.391 --> 07:13.962
when the legislature convened in January 1973. It

07:14.723 --> 07:31.440
was during this special session in 1972 that I 
agreed to disperse of my dairy herd and have a state

07:14.723 --> 07:31.440
representative auctioneer the cattle off. Sale 
was held in December and I felt that this was

07:37.579 --> 07:56.989
positioning me to either to leave the legislature 
and find a full-time employment upon the

07:37.579 --> 07:56.989
completion of the regular session in 1973. There 
was always a possibility that I could find

07:58.505 --> 08:06.736
employment that would allow me to continue to 
serve in the legislature, but there were no

07:58.505 --> 08:06.736
guarantees. The legislative session convening 
in January 1973 became known as the Reform

08:09.039 --> 08:16.529
Session. We had a new speaker in Price Daniel, Jr. 
We had a new lieutenant governor in Bill Hobby and a

08:17.631 --> 08:26.723
new governor in Dolph Briscoe. The first actions 
that a new legislature takes is to adopt its rules

08:27.901 --> 08:34.889
of procedure. This usually follows immediately 
after the election of the Speaker. The

08:43.018 --> 08:50.826
legislature had adopted some changes in the rules 
during the special session under Rayford Price.

08:50.846 --> 08:52.508
One of those rules required that a person that 
served on a committee continue to serve on that

08:52.893 --> 09:00.621
committee as long as he was in the legislature. We 
called it the retention seniority rule. The rules

09:05.246 --> 09:08.590
were laid out. I found that the retention 
seniority rule had been removed. And so when the

09:17.499 --> 09:22.765
time came to take the vote on the rules, I voted 
against the rules. When you vote against the

09:26.021 --> 09:30.106
rules, you're voting against the speaker. And 
this vote probably cost me a seat on the House

09:32.089 --> 09:39.558
Appropriations Committee. I just could not bring 
myself to vote for rules that remove the retention

09:41.781 --> 09:52.414
seniority rule, which I thought was a good rule and 
would provide continuity on the committee.

09:57.904 --> 10:03.229
I think that is sorely needed on all committees in 
the House of Representatives. Instead of serving

10:05.111 --> 10:14.520
on the House Appropriations Committee, which has 
consumed so much time, I was placed on the

10:05.111 --> 10:14.520
Education Committee. I

10:14.540 --> 10:20.646
was chaired by Dan Kubiak. Being served on the 
Appropriations Committee for two terms gave me a

10:21.925 --> 10:41.638
different perspective with regards to education 
legislation that came before the committee, and I

10:21.925 --> 10:41.638
felt like I was able to make a contribution to the 
piece of legislation that we were able to prevail

10:21.925 --> 10:41.638
upon. had to do with the way public kindergarten 
was structured. In 1971, a kindergarten bill had

10:48.692 --> 11:05.316
been passed, but it was not to allow all 
five-year-olds to attend public kindergarten.

11:05.336 --> 11:11.625
It was very difficult, almost impossible to 
explain to the public why the legislature passed

11:12.820 --> 11:20.849
such a bill saying that half of the children could 
go to public kindergarten but half of them could

11:12.820 --> 11:20.849
not. Came up with the idea that we could do the same 
thing for the same money by making kindergarten

11:21.950 --> 11:29.819
half day and allowing all children to attend. I had 
just finished

11:31.001 --> 11:42.574
going to a private kindergarten and it was my 
impression that attending for a half a day, which

11:43.398 --> 11:53.370
she did, was adequate and all that a five-year-old 
could handle. I did not have the votes in committee

11:53.390 --> 12:11.110
to prevail on the issue, but adopted a strategy 
that I have never seen used before or since with

11:53.390 --> 12:11.110
regards to influencing legislation. I conspired 
with two or three members to attend the committee

12:12.035 --> 12:27.249
meetings but with the understanding that they 
would not attend the meetings and therefore the

12:12.035 --> 12:27.249
committee would not have a quorum and could not 
take a vote. I needed to be there to be sure to

12:28.691 --> 12:37.639
challenge the chairman that a quorum was not 
present and that he could not take a vote. After

12:37.659 --> 12:40.742
several weeks I was contacted by the lobbyists for 
the Texas State Teachers Association and agreed

12:42.190 --> 13:02.590
that to a half-day kindergarten program if I would 
help get a quorum back to the Education Committee

12:42.190 --> 13:02.590
meeting. Agreed, and at the next meeting we had a 
quorum and voted the bill out with a half-day

13:03.811 --> 13:11.218
kindergarten provision. It was also in 1973 that 
the new members, which there were many, decided

13:12.498 --> 13:24.291
that there should be a Constitutional 
Convention. So by resolution, one was created to

13:24.992 --> 13:32.460
convene in 1974. The members of the 
Constitutional Convention would be the members

13:32.820 --> 13:40.108
of the Texas House and the Texas Senate. Early in 
the session, the reform bills started pouring out

13:41.084 --> 13:55.122
of committees, such bills as open meetings, open 
records, etc. There was a lobby control bill, and

13:56.444 --> 14:06.197
all these bills had serious constitutional 
questions and concerns. the members of the House

14:06.481 --> 14:15.996
were determined to pass the legislation because 
of the political consequences if they voted

14:06.481 --> 14:15.996
against them. I voted against most of these bills 
because I felt like they were bad legislation. I

14:26.833 --> 14:34.665
recorded my reason for voting against certain 
bills, particularly the lobby control bill, and

14:36.265 --> 14:48.195
This was very helpful when the campaign season 
rolled around and my opponent was attempting to

14:36.265 --> 14:48.195
use this as a campaign issue. We'll discuss this in 
more detail later. A bill that I was happy to

14:53.180 --> 15:04.770
co-sponsor would create a veterinary diagnostic 
laboratory in Amarillo and would be a part of the

15:05.442 --> 15:16.393
laboratory in College Station that is under the 
direction of the Texas A&M University System

15:05.442 --> 15:16.393
Board of Regents. The primary sponsors of the bill 
both in the House and the Senate were from Amarillo

15:16.413 --> 15:24.540
where the lab would be located. We were able to pass 
the bill in the House and send it over to the Senate

15:33.691 --> 15:41.078
When it left the House, it was unclear as to where 
the laboratory would be located. When the House

15:42.339 --> 16:02.618
bill was returned by the Senate to the House, the 
amendment

15:42.339 --> 16:02.618
saying that the laboratory would be located in 
Amarillo had been added.

16:04.319 --> 16:14.955
was unhappy with this language and I have never 
known what his problem was since he was a resident

16:04.319 --> 16:14.955
of Amarillo. Rumor was that he wanted to locate it 
in Canyon on the campus of West Texas State

16:15.996 --> 16:22.285
University.

16:24.829 --> 16:26.091
He never told me that. The speaker was ready to 
concur in the Senate amendments to the House bill

16:27.218 --> 16:34.908
and send the bill on to the governor. The speaker 
called me forward and told me that the sponsor was

16:36.089 --> 16:49.627
in the hospital and was there any controversy 
about the bill. And I said, not if we pass it now. He

16:54.623 --> 16:57.726
said, then let's move to concur. I

16:57.746 --> 17:12.499
did move to concur knowing

16:57.746 --> 17:12.499
that the sponsor of the bill was not going to be 
happy with what I did. Before that day, the sponsor

17:13.640 --> 17:22.048
was released from the hospital and came to the 
House floor and

17:25.690 --> 17:28.654
made the unusual move to recall the bill. Okay, 
two-thirds vote. After he explained that he did

17:33.761 --> 17:48.801
not want the bill to pass in its present state, he

17:33.761 --> 17:48.801
was able to get a two-thirds vote. He usually has a 
right to control his own bill to that extent.

17:55.053 --> 18:11.076
Rather than send the bill to a conference 
committee, however, he placed the bill on the

17:55.053 --> 18:11.076
table, subject to call, which meant that it could 
be brought from the table and voted on,

17:55.053 --> 18:11.076
concurrence could be voted on at any time. Texas 
Farm Bureau was keenly interested in seeing the

18:12.639 --> 18:23.254
bill passed, and on the last day, with the bill 
still laying on the table and not having been acted

18:12.639 --> 18:23.254
upon,

18:26.643 --> 18:31.349
asked me if there was anything that could be done to 
pass the bill. It suddenly occurred to me that

18:33.612 --> 18:49.674
there was a legislator in the Texas Panhandle that 
might could pass the bill if he would be willing to

18:33.612 --> 18:49.674
do so, but that I did not feel like that I could do it. 
This legislator walked by about this time And we

18:55.313 --> 19:03.764
called him aside and the Farm Bureau asked him if he 
would be willing to pick up the bill and pass it. He

19:04.885 --> 19:14.457
said, if I get enough contact from constituents in 
my district that they want this bill passed before

19:04.885 --> 19:14.457
the day is out, I will pass it. I will attempt to pass 
it. The wife was from the Texas Panhandle and I knew

19:23.225 --> 19:30.095
at least one cattleman in the Texas Panhandle that 
was very active politically. So I placed a phone

19:31.798 --> 19:44.056
call to

19:31.798 --> 19:44.056
this person and explained the situation, and that 
was all that was necessary. I'm sure the Farm

19:46.139 --> 19:52.388
Bureau was making its contacts at the same time, so 
in a short time, there were on the desk of the

19:53.363 --> 20:03.256
panhandle legislator a large stack of telephone 
messages. This provided the legislator the

20:05.158 --> 20:19.877
excuse that he needed to

20:05.158 --> 20:19.877
pick up and pass the bill, even though his 
colleague was still not for passing it. As a result

20:20.870 --> 20:31.202
of that action, the Texas A&M University System 
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Amarillo

20:20.870 --> 20:31.202
exists today. One Sunday afternoon a supposedly 
non-controversial bill was placed on the consent

20:33.845 --> 20:45.038
calendar that provided or the University of Texas 
system to have authority over marine-related

20:46.267 --> 20:56.045
research.

20:58.890 --> 21:10.131
The University of Texas system had a fine facility 
at Port Aransas, but little use was being made of

20:58.890 --> 21:10.131
it. It appeared that this bill would subtly give 
the University of Texas system statutory

21:12.490 --> 21:29.813
authority over all research dealing with the 
coast and the oceans. Before Texas A&M University

21:31.656 --> 21:38.565
was training about half of the oceanographers in 
the world, all at the graduate level. I moved to

21:45.467 --> 21:49.571
block the bill from passage. And I understand 
later that this created dialogue

21:50.853 --> 22:10.392
between the University of Texas system and the A&M 
system regarding oceanographic research and

21:50.853 --> 22:10.392
marine-related research for the first time. To 
this day, Texas A&M is much stronger in the deep

22:11.941 --> 22:20.674
water, blue water, ocean research. And 
University of Texas is predominantly in the

22:21.495 --> 22:29.807
business of providing research in the bays and 
estuaries. To measure that, I was unable to stop in

22:31.008 --> 22:37.678
the House, but we were able to get it killed in the 
Senate. dealt with the treatment of Prairie View

22:38.249 --> 22:45.619
by the Texas A&M University System Board of 
Regents. There was a school of thought that

22:45.639 --> 23:04.426
Prairie View was being treated badly because of 
facilities that at Prairie View were not up to

22:45.639 --> 23:04.426
standards of those on the main campus. Most of 
these facilities are supported from non-tax

23:08.438 --> 23:10.820
revenues. For example, the football coach, I'm 
told, wanted a new stadium there and could not

23:10.840 --> 23:22.811
understand why they could not build a new stadium 
using state funds.

23:25.854 --> 23:36.184
When the resolution came up on the floor, Prairie 
View students had just testified before the House

23:25.854 --> 23:36.184
Appropriations Committee that from time to time 
they had no hot water in the dormitories. The issue

23:40.022 --> 23:56.038
became a racial one and members of the legislature 
who had minorities in their district still voted

23:40.022 --> 23:56.038
for the resolution. They did not want to be labeled 
as a racist and wanted to get along with the

23:57.219 --> 24:06.829
minority members in the legislature as their 
numbers had grown dramatically in the last

24:07.096 --> 24:09.899
redistricting. One of the bills that I was 
carrying that session would have authorized new

24:11.660 --> 24:26.415
construction at the Uvalde Research Center under 
the Texas A&M University system. It was the home of

24:28.017 --> 24:35.584
the governor and was a bill that he wanted to see 
passed. The Senate had passed the bill very early

24:36.779 --> 24:55.628
in the session, but it was brought up in the 
Calendars Committee,

24:36.779 --> 24:55.628
not placed on the calendar until the last day of the 
session.

24:59.094 --> 25:03.040
The bill was seven pages deep into the calendar, 
And there was no way that the House was going to pass

25:03.172 --> 25:11.781
seven pages of bills on the last day of the session. 
Early in the day, I spoke to the governor in his

25:13.283 --> 25:19.369
office about the problem. He immediately turned 
and picked up a red telephone on his desk.

25:29.935 --> 25:36.566
Ed Price, referring to the Speaker of the House, I 
want to see you in my office right now. The Speaker

25:38.128 --> 25:44.058
left the podium and was in the Governor's office in 
less than two minutes. I asked the Governor,

25:45.461 --> 25:46.843
should I leave? And he said, no, you stay right 
there. When the Speaker came in, the Governor

25:50.569 --> 25:56.719
informed him that The bill that he wanted to see 
passed was on page seven, and he wanted the bill

25:57.661 --> 26:06.029
passed before the legislature adjourned that 
day. Speaker proceeded to tell him that he had had

26:07.230 --> 26:27.010
problems with the state senator who was the author 
of the bill, and the governor interrupted and

26:07.230 --> 26:27.010
said, I'm concerned with your problems with the 
Senate sponsor. This is a bill that I want to see

26:27.412 --> 26:29.635
passed. The House of Representatives still had 
not gone on the calendar and started passing any of

26:31.338 --> 26:39.751
the bills. Shortly thereafter, the first bill was 
laid out. That first bill happened to be on the top

26:48.004 --> 26:52.231
of page seven. To my amazement, No one called a 
point of order that the speaker cannot start

26:55.829 --> 27:07.742
anywhere except at the top of the calendar, page 
one. Finally, get to the bottom of the calendar

27:09.184 --> 27:25.161
where the Uvalde Research Center bill had been 
placed, and shortly after it was passed, the House

27:09.184 --> 27:25.161
adjourned. sign he died. House Daniel Jr., as 
Speaker, had agreed to serve only one term,

27:28.215 --> 27:44.690
and this, in my opinion, left him in somewhat a 
weakened position toward the end of the session.

27:45.831 --> 27:54.338
The legislators were faced with a constitutional 
convention to convene in January of 1974

27:56.613 --> 28:07.768
Price Daniel Jr. was the only person that was 
campaigning for to be chairman of the

27:56.613 --> 28:07.768
Constitutional Convention. So in 1974, he was 
elected to

28:07.828 --> 28:18.542
chair the Constitutional Convention. Also 
election year, and I drew another opponent. that

28:27.173 --> 28:36.684
this time a city councilman from Bryan and a 
longtime personal friend. Not take me long to

28:38.246 --> 28:49.139
realize that the local publisher of the local 
daily newspaper was helping my opponent in every

28:38.246 --> 28:49.139
way that he could. Our campaign was getting a lot of 
publicity. Most of it was not to my favor. I recall

28:58.684 --> 29:17.751
one Saturday morning picking up the paper and 
there was an article by my opponent

28:58.684 --> 29:17.751
reflecting upon my vote against the lobby control 
bill and how this was such a bad vote. I immediately

29:19.368 --> 29:38.152
drafted a rebuttal and located the editor of the 
newspaper and told him that I would be bringing a

29:19.368 --> 29:38.152
rebuttal down and I expected to have equal space 
with my opponent. The comment was that that

29:39.915 --> 29:44.160
article was supposed to run in the Sunday's paper. 
And I said that someone made a mistake and ran it

29:45.727 --> 29:52.036
this morning on Saturday. But I expected mine to be 
in the Sunday paper. After a series of attacks by my

29:57.464 --> 30:09.642
opponent, I finally told the publisher of the 
paper one day that if the race continue to be on the

30:11.275 --> 30:16.881
front page there would be no need for me to buy any 
paid advertising. After that the story stopped.

30:22.447 --> 30:35.741
This time the Constitutional Convention was 
going on which meant that for four days out of the

30:22.447 --> 30:35.741
week I was in Austin as a member of the 
Constitutional Convention. I maintained some

30:37.142 --> 30:39.004
continuity In the political campaign,

30:39.997 --> 30:50.849
I set up a Friday morning breakfast with 
constituents and campaign workers. And this gave

30:52.591 --> 31:00.961
me a way to catch up on things that had happened 
during the week that I needed to be aware of. And

31:01.001 --> 31:09.430
that the breakfast worked great in providing me 
with the information that I needed and recruiting

31:10.608 --> 31:16.756
more campaign workers as we brought in new people 
from time to time to the breakfast. The convention

31:18.238 --> 31:29.753
did take a 30-day recess prior to the primary 
election to allow the members to go home and

31:18.238 --> 31:29.753
campaign before the primary elections. In Texas 
at that time there were few general elections and

31:31.756 --> 31:40.227
many primary elections. or as state legislative 
races were concerned.

31:48.738 --> 31:57.990
One of the issues my opponent raised through 
street talk was, was I a Christian? Did I go to

31:58.030 --> 31:58.892
church? Truth was that I had been teaching Sunday 
school in a small rural church for about nine or ten

32:01.074 --> 32:07.783
years. held virtually every office in the local 
church where I was a member. Question in my mind is

32:16.467 --> 32:23.236
how do you answer a rumor

32:16.467 --> 32:23.236
of that sort? To me that an issue that would be 
coming before the Constitutional Convention in

32:24.278 --> 32:33.551
the very near future was one of gambling. It sounds 
simple enough to simply say you're opposed to

32:34.852 --> 32:39.559
gambling, But I had a very large constituency that 
liked to play bingo. And there was a big question as

32:48.642 --> 32:55.271
to whether or not bingo would be included when the 
gambling issue came up. I decided the best way to

32:56.853 --> 33:05.665
approach the issue before I made a statement that 
would hopefully

33:08.733 --> 33:24.950
stop any further street talk about my Christian 
faith was to call a friend in the legislature who

33:08.733 --> 33:24.950
was a devout Catholic and get his views on how to 
handle the issue. With his guidance, we were able

33:25.971 --> 33:35.280
to make a public release as to our opposition to 
gambling without alienating a large

33:36.155 --> 33:40.040
constituency of people that like to play bingo. 
And we hopefully defused the church issue for the

33:41.281 --> 33:50.032
balance of that campaign. My opponent had worked 
many hours in Robertson County, and because of the

33:51.974 --> 34:04.609
Constitutional Convention, I was able to make 
very few trips to the county. As a result, I did not

34:05.838 --> 34:10.825
feel good about the vote I would get in Hearn.

34:13.870 --> 34:18.437
There was a scandal in Hearn at the time with 
regards to the city councilman. And in addition to

34:20.480 --> 34:27.710
that, I had missed a big highway dedication in the 
town. I did very well in Hearn. I got 60% of the vote.

34:35.740 --> 34:43.447
I knew that that was a signal that I would win the 
election. I've often wondered if the fact that the

34:43.467 --> 35:05.747
local newspaper in Brine that had been carrying 
the Hearn scandal on the front page for so long had

34:43.467 --> 35:05.747
alienated the people in Hearn and when the paper 
endorsed my opponent, it may have backfired and

34:43.467 --> 35:05.747
helped me in in the surrounding area. It did hurt my 
ego not to get the endorsement of the local

35:09.329 --> 35:13.616
newspaper. It may have done as much good as it did 
harm. The election was over and I had won. I

35:24.391 --> 35:32.443
returned to Austin to finish up the work on the 
Constitutional Convention. The education

35:33.773 --> 35:51.677
committee was the first one to finish its work and I 
had been given primary responsibility for

35:33.773 --> 35:51.677
rewriting the permanent university fund section 
of the education article. Able to keep the higher

35:53.480 --> 36:02.312
education portion intact and the permanent 
university fund intact with very little

35:53.480 --> 36:02.312
controversy. Most of the controversy dealt with 
the constitutional provision that provides for

36:03.254 --> 36:12.002
the school system. The big issue was the use of the 
term equal educational opportunity and what this

36:13.444 --> 36:23.854
meant. It was viewed by some conservatives as a 
threat to local control. that the education

36:32.363 --> 36:45.441
article was the first article that the speaker 
wanted out on the floor to be debated and passed in

36:32.363 --> 36:45.441
the Constitutional Convention by the full 
convention. And ironically, he

36:46.582 --> 36:58.438
relied on me to help him get the bill out very 
quickly. a little ribbing over this by some of my

36:59.768 --> 37:15.311
colleagues who were observing what was going on, 
saying they were glad that Daniel and I were

36:59.768 --> 37:15.311
finally getting along, something that we could 
agree on. The education article in the

37:16.854 --> 37:23.964
Constitutional Convention went rather smoothly 
compared to some of the other articles. The

37:25.567 --> 37:26.468
article that got the most debate was the general 
provisions article the reasons that every issue

37:27.545 --> 37:55.358
that one could think of could fit under the general 
provisions article that one of the legislators

37:27.545 --> 37:55.358
who was known for his levity and used it as a way to 
make a point now and then offered an amendment to

37:27.545 --> 37:55.358
license environmentalists as an amendment to the 
General Provisions article of the Constitution.

38:02.158 --> 38:19.827
To paraphrase him, that he had sat on a committee 
the session before where some environmental

38:02.158 --> 38:19.827
bills had come up, and he said, we have people come 
before the committee and say they are concerned

38:20.785 --> 38:28.175
environmentalists, and we do not know whether 
they're environmentalists or just some nut that

38:20.785 --> 38:28.175
walked in off the street. For that reason, he was 
recommending that we license environmentalists

38:29.536 --> 38:39.890
and then we'd know which ones are 
environmentalists and which ones are just nuts

38:29.536 --> 38:39.890
that walk in off the street. It was not serious, but 
he did make a point. The race for Speaker was rather

38:44.816 --> 38:50.083
heated during the Constitutional Convention and 
was an undertow that was play a rather significant

38:51.447 --> 39:01.216
role. I refer to it as an undertow because you 
didn't see it every day, but you knew it was there.

39:08.343 --> 39:19.494
For Speaker of the House to be elected in January 
1975 was wide open. There were

39:23.645 --> 39:31.855
seven or eight legislators that were competing 
for the speakership.

39:33.156 --> 39:40.705
I had decided early in the race to support Bill 
Clayton as a candidate for Speaker.

39:43.829 --> 39:51.778
Clayton had become tagged as so conservative that 
he probably had little chance of ever winning the

39:43.829 --> 39:51.778
race. The more likely winners were either Fred 
Head, who had the backing of all the new members of

39:52.805 --> 40:09.989
the legislature who he had campaigned with early 
on, and he had the backing of Labor. Carl Parker, a

40:11.812 --> 40:19.302
third candidate, had a more moderate backing.

40:21.796 --> 40:29.048
In fact, his support probably ranged from 
ultra-liberal to conservative. He saw Parker as

40:30.490 --> 40:36.180
the eventual winner and probably for that reason 
supported him. Price Daniel Jr., who was chairing

40:37.562 --> 40:47.719
the Constitutional Convention, had been a friend 
of Labor in the past, but decided that He must

40:48.391 --> 40:56.178
include a right to work provision in the 
Constitution or it would fail. The new members of

40:57.639 --> 41:16.356
the legislature that were serving their first 
term were the chief supporters of constitutional

40:57.639 --> 41:16.356
revision and wanted to see the Constitutional 
Convention succeed. Fred Head saw an opportunity

41:17.737 --> 41:37.146
to rule the labor support for his speaker's race by 
going to labor and saying that he would not support

41:17.737 --> 41:37.146
the Constitutional Convention

41:43.538 --> 41:47.082
document if they would support him for speaker. So 
an agreement was struck. I was a close lieutenant

41:50.947 --> 42:05.664
of Price Daniels, Jr., so this meant that he would 
vote for the constitutional revision. Mixed

42:05.684 --> 42:12.432
emotions about how to vote for a constitutional 
revision. had some real problems with some of the

42:13.137 --> 42:20.666
provisions that were there and felt like it was 
better not to have constitutional revision. On

42:21.688 --> 42:35.685
the other hand, it would probably be in Mr.

42:21.688 --> 42:35.685
Clayton's favor if I voted for the constitutional 
revision.

42:38.703 --> 42:46.511
Show good faith with the freshman members that 
wanted to see revision take place. When the final

42:47.992 --> 42:57.521
vote was called for, it required 121 votes to be 
cast in favor of constitutional revision. I voted

42:59.423 --> 43:06.550
for revision, but could see that it was going to 
fail.

43:09.719 --> 43:16.850
The voting board was left open for an extended 
period of time in an attempt to get the 121 votes. It

43:18.011 --> 43:27.506
started out with about 115 votes and eventually 
got to 118 but could never get above that number. So

43:29.008 --> 43:37.701
it fell three votes short of passing the revision 
document to the voting public for their approval

43:38.643 --> 43:42.266
or disapproval. More importantly, it meant the 
demise of Mr. Head's race for the speakership. It

43:51.655 --> 44:06.068
was after the Constitutional Convention had 
adjourned, the new members that were supporting

43:51.655 --> 44:06.068
Mr. Head announced that they were withdrawing 
their support from him but were not committing to

44:06.335 --> 44:09.241
another candidate at that time. They said they 
were going to take their time, interview all the

44:10.122 --> 44:17.176
candidates, and make their decision as a group. A 
short time later, just before Labor Day in 1974,

44:18.478 --> 44:28.798
Fred Head,

44:32.879 --> 44:51.958
to Bill Clayton and told him that his support had 
deteriorated and that he was ready to join forces

44:32.879 --> 44:51.958
with him, with Clayton, and see if he

44:32.879 --> 44:51.958
could help get him elected as Speaker. Parker had 
felt all along that Fred Head's support would

44:53.400 --> 45:01.468
naturally come to him because there were many of 
the more liberal members that were supporting

45:02.275 --> 45:31.945
fred head and they could not support mr clayton mr 
clayton however was able to persuade the more

45:02.275 --> 45:31.945
liberal faction that was supporting head that he 
would always be fair with them where they

45:02.275 --> 45:31.945
certainly would have questions in their own mind 
about parker treating them fairly all led to a

45:32.667 --> 45:56.657
phone call I received on Friday before Labor Day 
saying that several of Mr. Clayton's supporters

45:32.667 --> 45:56.657
were getting together in Austin at the Driscoll 
Hotel to see if they could come use of support that

45:32.667 --> 45:56.657
Fred had given Mr. Clayton. It was not a carefully 
planned out event, I decided to go and call

46:04.055 --> 46:09.822
Saturday morning to say that I would be on my way 
shortly. They asked me if I would pick up the new

46:11.304 --> 46:20.875
member that had been elected in the district just 
south of me. He was one of the members that was

46:22.157 --> 46:33.370
uncommitted and was a holdout since they had 
broken with Fred Head. I contacted the member,

46:34.480 --> 46:41.328
picked him up in Navasota, and we drove to Austin. 
It turned out that he was very key in persuading the

46:42.189 --> 46:55.105
leadership of the new members to all come over to 
Mr. Clayton's side. This was truly a Labor Day

46:56.013 --> 47:05.247
blitz that hit the opposition before they could 
recover.
