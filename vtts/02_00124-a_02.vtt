00:02.849 --> 00:14.408
Jay Wayne would go to see anybody about anything to 
benefit his program, financially or to help a

00:02.849 --> 00:14.408
student or whatever. It was a pure orientation. It 
wasn't to benefit himself in any way. I've not seen

00:21.479 --> 00:23.823
anybody live in a more frugal home. His salary was 
not that great. He didn't do it for money. I did it

00:29.748 --> 00:32.492
for power, but power to help students. And so I 
respected them. Never, never at any time ever

00:36.697 --> 00:44.828
thought that I would be better off with someone 
else in that position. I did think that about a lot

00:44.848 --> 00:48.834
of other positions, but never and never.

00:50.696 --> 00:53.019
I'm not going to ask the negative one. Other than 
Wayne Stark, who were described your favorite...

00:59.060 --> 01:01.324
staff, your subordinate colleagues? Oh, I had in 
my office starting out, I had Howard Perry and Bob

01:02.726 --> 01:09.859
Melcher. And they were two super, super guys. Of 
course, the year later, we added Ormond Simpson.

01:18.554 --> 01:20.518
So I had three Aggies. Oh, and Malin, of course, was 
in my office at that time, too. I had four A's to kind

01:24.052 --> 01:29.938
of keep me on a straight and narrow to make sure that 
I didn't screw up. They were all wonderful and

01:31.239 --> 01:34.162
different in their own way. Bob Melcher, well, Bob 
Melcher and Malin were both seen by the student

01:35.103 --> 01:42.291
body initially as spies. They thought student 
leaders that came to see me as soon after I got here.

01:48.617 --> 01:53.282
Was it Melcher and Malin just come around to see 
things to tell General Hannigan, and he was in

01:53.735 --> 01:57.340
trouble. What were their nicknames? Oh, God, I 
can't, I've forgotten. Malin was the Slink. Yeah.

02:04.330 --> 02:05.772
And was Melcher the Wedge? I've forgotten. 
Because according to the students, Malin slinked

02:09.438 --> 02:18.311
around to snoop on

02:09.438 --> 02:18.311
them. Yeah. But those guys in the office... Oh, and 
another one. O.L. Luther. O.L. headed up

02:28.622 --> 02:30.424
University Police and O.L. was a former Texas 
Ranger. He was a wonderful guy. Terrible

02:37.474 --> 02:39.137
administrator. Just a wonderful human being. 
But, so, Tom Parsons. Tom was a good man. I liked

02:48.590 --> 02:49.311
Tom. I enjoyed working with Tom. Tom had a lot of 
negative things happen family-wise to him in

02:53.675 --> 02:59.866
terms of his wife and his family. But he was a Texas 
Aggie through and through and through. He was a

03:05.616 --> 03:06.998
good administrator. He would do anything to help a 
youngster as well. I think Jay Wayne's attitude

03:15.089 --> 03:24.300
You know, that was the same attitude that Ormond 
Simpson had, Malin had, and Bob Elcher had, and

03:15.089 --> 03:24.300
Howard Curry had. And people didn't see that, but 
that was the cream that came to the top for me. It's

03:29.306 --> 03:31.509
related to those individuals. Now, some who had 
that had some difficulties with administrative

03:31.529 --> 03:42.042
kinds of things, and just like O.L., I finally 
decided that what we would do was to have Bob

03:43.237 --> 03:51.187
Melcher do the administrative types of things as 
it related to University Police. And Orwell would

03:51.207 --> 03:56.714
pick up on the personal relationships and so on. So 
you work around that. They were good people, good

04:00.658 --> 04:02.641
human beings. All right. Early on, did you sense 
there were any problems that were here when you

04:03.102 --> 04:12.433
arrived that you had to tackle? Quickly. Anything

04:15.615 --> 04:21.394
you had to clean up, straighten up? Not really in 
regard to anything that Jim had left behind. I

04:28.331 --> 04:35.121
think the fraternity-sorority thing was 
something that we wanted to work on on a continuing

04:28.331 --> 04:35.121
basis at that particular time. Oh. Women in the 
Corps, that was the first year. And so that was

04:40.628 --> 04:43.352
something we had to continue to work on.

04:47.979 --> 04:50.282
When you arrived, there were no women in the Corps? 
Yet. Tom had integrated that, well he had agreed to

04:51.783 --> 04:58.131
integrate that spring. So it was that first fall 
that I was here. Fall of 73. That we had women in the

05:01.355 --> 05:05.661
Corps for the first time. And do you recall how that 
went that first fall? Some pluses or minuses? The

05:17.756 --> 05:20.760
interesting thing is that I'm reminded of this 
time after time with the Citadel and the

05:21.787 --> 05:31.844
institutions in Virginia. You're going to have 
some women who get upset about the manner in which

05:32.144 --> 05:39.216
they're treated. And they're not... My 
perception of a female in the Corps of Cadets or in

05:42.509 --> 05:53.127
the military is one that's sort of tomboyish, that 
they like the physical kinds of things. And they

05:55.050 --> 05:57.234
handle the Corps well. But there are some who don't 
like the physical things, and it's amazing why

05:57.655 --> 06:05.749
they get interested in the Corps, but then are very 
resentful. And so way back in the beginning, young

06:08.598 --> 06:12.946
ladies dropping out of the Corps who would really 
raise team about what had been done to them. And

06:13.567 --> 06:16.191
that was a continuing thing all the way up until I 
retired. And it's still ongoing now. We had a

06:21.501 --> 06:23.404
number of wonderful young ladies. I saw an article 
just in the paper the other day about the first

06:23.424 --> 06:32.580
woman who graduated who spent four years in the 
Corps at A&M, is retiring as a major. That was in the

06:38.313 --> 06:41.859
newspaper. In Eagle? Well, it was in Eagle within 
the past few days. I don't know if it's Eagle. It may

06:47.267 --> 06:49.471
have been in a column. I need to chase her down, 
because she'd be a good interview subject.

06:57.624 --> 07:00.188
Let's see. To get back to your question, I really 
didn't feel under the gun about anything.

07:11.835 --> 07:14.639
You know, nothing that just stuck its neck out. 
Alright, now let's reach out across the campus.

07:17.683 --> 07:30.360
Your key administrative associates outside 
Student Life, who were the

07:17.683 --> 07:30.360
key people First of all, we're Tom Cherry,

07:30.863 --> 07:41.477
Clyde Freeman, John Calhoun.

07:43.700 --> 07:57.037
And in talking to John, I decided that the best way 
that I could get to know all the economic folks was

07:43.700 --> 07:57.037
to attend his dean's meeting every time. That was 
super for me because I got to know everyone. to know

08:00.631 --> 08:02.493
what the institution was all about. In that group, 
of course, Frank Huber, strong in education. Fred

08:08.338 --> 08:10.119
Benson, an engineer.

08:13.542 --> 08:17.846
Mac Breska, and the reason I giggle about Mac, 
first time I met Mac was by telephone. He called me

08:18.487 --> 08:26.314
and he was fussing about somebody had parked in his 
parking place and he wanted the damn police to come

08:18.487 --> 08:26.314
over and pull that damn car out. And so, I went over 
to visit with Mac after that and got to know Mac. So,

08:35.420 --> 08:38.144
the Deans, John Pearson in business. Oh golly, 
over in Liberal Arts with David... Maxwell.

08:48.077 --> 08:50.520
Maxwell. Veterinary Medicine. George Shelton 
and I were hired on the same day by the board and so

08:52.362 --> 08:58.110
George and Ah, George. I can't think of his wife's 
name. Joy. I keep thinking of Joy. George and Joy

09:08.177 --> 09:14.606
became good friends and we have remained good 
friends ever since.

09:16.569 --> 09:18.892
Oh, geosciences. Earl. Cook. I really liked the 
academic beings. You and and Dick were also

09:29.073 --> 09:32.558
included in that particular group. My 
relationship I thought was a good one, and I

09:32.578 --> 09:46.456
thought everyone was very kind to me in regard to 
helping me understand the institution and all the

09:32.578 --> 09:46.456
programs going on, and were very supportive. So 
all that was excellent. And I'm sure that John was

09:48.759 --> 09:54.827
the one that, you know, leader in that, although 
you and Dick may have been as well because you all

09:55.837 --> 10:01.605
were super to me too. As far as I was aware, 
everything went well when you arrived. We saw

10:07.733 --> 10:10.337
things going smoothly. All right, let's see. Do 
you remember any hot

10:13.962 --> 10:23.515
colds rolling out of the fireplace in your early 
year or so?

10:27.106 --> 10:29.529
some problem that had to have immediate 
attention? Oh, the first one was a crazy one. And

10:38.820 --> 10:46.749
that was

10:38.820 --> 10:46.749
we had the nudes. That first fall, we had the nudes 
running around the campus. That became a problem.

10:57.059 --> 10:58.581
I'm trying to think of the slang word.

11:01.645 --> 11:02.265
Not stripping.

11:11.677 --> 11:13.479
So the word we were looking for is streaking. Go 
ahead.

11:21.209 --> 11:26.155
That evening that they had the streaking, there 
were a few people arrested. And a large number of

11:26.675 --> 11:32.385
students went to the President's house.

11:35.591 --> 11:36.392
I was out of town.

11:40.379 --> 11:42.623
In fact, I was up at East Texas. I'd been invited 
back up to Commerce for something. And so Howard

11:45.548 --> 11:48.413
Perry called me. I don't believe that Dr. Williams 
ever turned on a light, ever came to the door to

11:49.186 --> 11:56.356
respond. It was dissipated by the University 
Police. But there was a picture of an

12:02.784 --> 12:16.122
individual in western garb, normal western 
clothing with a rope getting ready to lasso an

12:16.388 --> 12:24.378
individual on a motorcycle who was in the nude. Do 
you remember that?

12:28.362 --> 12:30.385
That's the door. That's the

12:30.405 --> 12:36.392
security system on the door. We worked through 
that one. That didn't last very long at our campus.

12:42.599 --> 12:45.703
Again, I think When I say our campus is 
conservative, I think we have everything that

12:46.628 --> 12:54.221
A&M, that any campus has, any place across the 
country. But I think we, in regard to, for example,

12:55.964 --> 13:03.857
like drugs, I think we have fewer that participate 
in drugs. I think we always had fewer who would go

13:04.298 --> 13:09.687
off on the deep end on whatever issue. And so 
therefore, I think the campus would bounce back to

13:12.211 --> 13:18.604
normal very soon after anything happened. Let's 
grab the drug topic. When do you remember drugs

13:21.209 --> 13:27.802
being an item here? Well, it was an item here since I 
came. Was it? But it had been an item in East Texas

13:31.094 --> 13:37.321
and it had been an item all over the country. What 
were the drugs of choice in your first years? I

13:41.105 --> 13:55.060
think marijuana was the big thing and acid and

13:41.105 --> 13:55.060
stuff that made you high. I can't think of enough. 
Not a real strong drug that people would get on. But

14:03.240 --> 14:06.245
yeah, those were problems. The major problem at 
A&M forever, and I guess will forever be, is

14:06.545 --> 14:13.476
alcohol. And there are too many things tied in with 
tradition in alcohol at A&M, and so therefore,

14:24.706 --> 14:29.292
probably that's the biggest problem. One year 
went by, we didn't have an alcohol-related death

14:29.312 --> 14:36.002
one time or another. All right, if you had 
omniscient power, omnipotent power also,

14:36.022 --> 14:49.280
all-knowing and all-power, could that be solved? 
Alcohol? I don't think it ever will be. I agree. I

14:54.050 --> 14:59.980
think with young people, it's something that they 
go through. There are a whole lot of things that you

15:00.842 --> 15:04.167
go through as you're growing up. My feelings about 
the students at A&M, no different than East Texas

15:05.069 --> 15:18.591
or wherever, if you can get them through that 
period of time without having them destroy

15:05.069 --> 15:18.591
themselves and their lives, then they were going 
to be okay after that. But there's going to be some

15:22.611 --> 15:26.877
experimentation in a lot of different things in a 
lot of different ways. And if you can just kind of

15:27.758 --> 15:36.611
get them through it without just falling apart

15:27.758 --> 15:36.611
or having them get killed. Can you generalize 
about who are the most susceptible drug and or

15:37.712 --> 15:44.581
alcohol students? My perception, to ask you, of 
all the kids that came to A&M, those kids whose

15:47.512 --> 16:03.826
parents were too rigid with them at home were the 
ones that kind of went off at the extreme when they

15:47.512 --> 16:03.826
came to the campus. Now, that's not objective. I 
don't have a whole lot of research on that. But in

16:07.990 --> 16:17.198
talking to lots and lots and lots of students, 
those whose parents were too rigid at home kind of

16:07.990 --> 16:17.198
just got off off track when he came. All right, 
could you generalize about whether rich or poor,

16:19.047 --> 16:25.537
urban or rural? I think it

16:26.759 --> 16:32.287
was all of those. I think it just, the family being 
too rigid about rules and regulations, you know,

16:32.948 --> 16:46.628
be it urban or rural, Catholic, Baptist, 
whatever.

16:47.452 --> 16:53.519
They have a tendency to go off on escapades to begin 
with, with alcohol. Alright, we start about

16:53.979 --> 16:55.581
streaking. Other problems that you remember in 
your first years?

17:03.630 --> 17:06.634
I mentioned women in the Corps. Began to occur the 
gays back at that time. gay students would come to

17:15.380 --> 17:20.066
visit with me about the possibility of starting an 
organization. So that problem began to... Was

17:20.586 --> 17:25.692
that early? Uh-huh. And it had been a problem at 
East Texas before I left there. So that wasn't, so

17:32.400 --> 17:39.028
it wasn't like it was a problem here and not any 
place else. I think generally that was beginning

17:40.130 --> 17:42.973
to happen. Do you remember discussing that matter 
with Dr. Williams and or the board? Dr. Williams,

17:48.276 --> 17:52.282
not the board, at the beginning.

17:55.407 --> 18:01.215
I felt at that time, because of the state 
legislation relating to groups who attempted to

18:02.613 --> 18:13.456
perpetuate those things which were illegal, it 
was inappropriate for us as an institution to

18:02.613 --> 18:13.456
recognize those groups. And that was the stance 
that I took and recommended to Dr. Williams and the

18:13.516 --> 18:23.777
board as we got into it. were dead against anything 
related to women in the band. That was another

18:31.706 --> 18:33.568
women in the band. And that eventually came out of 
the St. Brad case, too. The board was opposed to

18:38.855 --> 18:40.036
that. And they did not want a gay student services 
organization on campus. Were there, in those

18:46.764 --> 18:54.253
early years, among the board members, were there 
any that were more sensitive to these matters than

18:54.875 --> 18:56.337
the others? Any of the board members?

19:04.566 --> 19:05.047
I'd have to. Or I presume the problem was the other 
way. It wasn't those who were sensitive. It was

19:11.494 --> 19:15.038
those who were closed. I'd have to go back and think 
about each one of the board members. The thing that

19:18.702 --> 19:26.231
comes through loud and clear about that period of 
time was Dr. Williams said, relating to those

19:18.702 --> 19:26.231
issues, John, I don't want you dealing with the 
board. I'll handle that, and I'll take care of

19:27.012 --> 19:28.774
that. And so I really didn't have those kinds of 
discussions with individual board members. And

19:33.620 --> 19:42.651
Dr. Williams kept that, which was good for me and a 
good way to have it.

19:45.975 --> 19:48.017
Too often, you get into a bad situation in regard to 
conversations that you have with a board member

19:48.301 --> 20:01.221
and saying things that maybe the president didn't 
want you to say or whatever, so did I. Did you have

20:01.602 --> 20:11.938
incidents of where board members contacted you or 
somebody in your staff directly about many

20:01.602 --> 20:11.938
matters? About housing all the time. Oh, okay. 
There, there. Asking for... Uh-huh. And I tried to

20:19.235 --> 20:29.508
take that load off of the president and so I tried to 
accommodate everyone that I could. It was just

20:30.530 --> 20:32.673
part of the institution. But that was no different 
than former students of any former student who was

20:34.054 --> 20:43.587
looking for help and support and a favor. In those 
early years, which board members did you sense,

20:44.022 --> 20:52.495
from your point of view, were the most potent, the 
most powerful, the most influential? Well, the

20:53.616 --> 20:55.259
beginning was Clyde Wells. I thought Mr. Wells was 
very strong. And in fact, when Dr. Williams

21:00.066 --> 21:13.185
eventually had his heart attack, I thought for a 
period of time that Mr. Wells was going to end up as

21:00.066 --> 21:13.185
chancellor of the institution. So he was strong. 
He was very, very nice to me. Never pushed in any way

21:20.089 --> 21:36.000
until when

21:20.089 --> 21:36.000
Tom Parsons, I believe, yeah, Tom was...

21:37.702 --> 21:43.447
Tom was the Chief of the University Police, if you 
remember, and he was going to retire. Oh

21:45.890 --> 21:51.575
no, it wasn't. If Tom was retiring as the 
Commandant, that's what it was. And I had talked to

21:56.840 --> 22:03.566
Dr. Williams about the fact that I wanted Tom to 
take over as Chief of the University Police.

22:04.206 --> 22:05.147
Director of Security. I wanted him to be Director 
of Security. Because Melcher was retiring and

22:08.414 --> 22:11.417
O.L. was going to be chief of police. I wanted Tom to 
be director of security. Jack Williams thought I

22:17.884 --> 22:21.188
was just trying to find a place for Tom Parsons. And 
I said, no. Yeah, I argued that Tom was the man. I

22:25.713 --> 22:29.677
thought Tom had Aggie orientation. I thought he 
would be supportive. I thought he could learn the

22:31.660 --> 22:33.882
police stuff that he knew. Clyde Wells had a guy up 
in Allen, just north of Dallas, an Aggie, that he

22:35.279 --> 22:52.326
wanted me to hire as chief of

22:35.279 --> 22:52.326
police. I went through the interview process my 
way, and I hired Tom. But I wasn't unkind to either

22:59.245 --> 23:10.239
Mr. Wells or that guy, and he was a nice person, but 
he wasn't what I wanted in that particular

22:59.245 --> 23:10.239
position. So that was the only time Mr. Wells ever 
kind of leaned on me a little bit, and it was simply

23:10.259 --> 23:20.912
because he thought this guy would be a good person 
for us to have. But the relationship with Clyde

23:21.314 --> 23:24.699
Ross was good. Clyde Freeman, I thought, was in a 
strong position

23:24.719 --> 23:30.526
then. And it appeared that Clyde Freeman, for a 
while, might be a chance. Of course, he was acting

23:37.276 --> 23:42.302
well while Dr. Williams was down. It's amazing 
that John Kellum was never thought to be or the

23:48.550 --> 23:52.135
person for that particular position. And I'm not 
sure. Of course, it wasn't privy to all the board

23:52.877 --> 24:03.913
meeting discussions why he wasn't considered.

24:05.375 --> 24:10.803
Let's tackle the women in the Corps matter. Women 
were in the Corps at the time you arrived? No, that

24:15.350 --> 24:16.472
fall. Yeah, that fall. Describe how that 
progressed, that fall, as you recall.

24:30.189 --> 24:46.587
The decision had been made by Tom and Stan and Dr. 
Williams that the women would not be totally

24:30.189 --> 24:46.587
integrated into all of the outfits and that they 
would be separated to live in their own dorm. made

24:47.579 --> 24:53.728
it a little bit difficult at the beginning because 
had to have male officers for those units. And that

24:56.112 --> 25:00.238
improved as it went along and having female 
leadership. So it was male leadership and that

25:01.199 --> 25:04.024
created some problems. Eventually, the fact that 
they were not integrated into all the units became

25:05.145 --> 25:11.455
a problem. So we could have solved some problems to 
begin with, that we integrated women into all

25:16.469 --> 25:18.833
units. But in retrospect, back at that time and 
still, in regard to the difficulties of male and

25:18.853 --> 25:35.497
female, just the natural, normal kinds of 
interrelationships,

25:18.853 --> 25:35.497
I would do it the same way. I wouldn't change it. 
There comes a time when you can overcome that. with

25:41.832 --> 25:46.300
the female leadership in those positions, 
leadership positions. So that was a problem all

25:46.320 --> 25:50.348
that year, in fact for a couple years. Do

25:50.688 --> 25:59.925
you remember any particular incidents, plus or 
minus?

26:01.795 --> 26:08.621
The interesting thing about the Corps is that 
probably a hell of a lot more things happened than

26:01.795 --> 26:08.621
we ever became aware of. And, you know, years 
later, the kids will, the adults will talk about

26:08.641 --> 26:16.507
the things that happened. But I think, for the most 
part,

26:16.527 --> 26:25.175
it went, we didn't have a major incident, I'll put 
it that way. Major incidents occurred later on,

26:25.195 --> 26:31.380
years to come, but during that first year, no major 
incident. And I don't remember of any physical

26:32.609 --> 26:42.486
event where some male physically attempted to do 
something to a female. We had, well, the physical

26:44.469 --> 26:54.246
things,

26:44.469 --> 26:54.246
crazy things to the core. shaking hands with an 
upperclassman, that some of the male

26:55.508 --> 27:05.218
upperclassmen would not interact with the female 
fish. And so that became a problem for us. And when I

27:10.824 --> 27:22.596
say it became a problem for us, it became a problem 
for the Corps of Leadership and the Corps of Staff

27:10.824 --> 27:22.596
and civilian staff as well in regard to getting 
people to understand we were integrating women

27:22.964 --> 27:29.014
into the Corps in every dimension. They were going 
to have to do that or they weren't going to be a part

27:29.995 --> 27:35.825
of the Corps or part of the institution. All right, 
the, and the women were in the Corps were all as

27:36.406 --> 27:47.183
freshmen to begin with and gradually moved up. 
What was the next threshold after being in the

27:48.158 --> 27:55.427
Corps, what was the next threshold? Fish drill 
team? Yeah, that was much, much later, much, much

27:58.972 --> 28:01.955
later. All right, I just want to follow up. But in 
thinking now,

28:05.520 --> 28:16.714
one problem we did have that just kind of popped up 
in my mind was that the Corps in the past had always

28:17.858 --> 28:29.650
handled discipline themselves and only as it 
related to the Corps. After I came, discipline was

28:31.191 --> 28:38.819
a university matter and not just a Corps matter. 
And so we had a problem with the military officers,

28:38.839 --> 28:47.848
military staff, of letting us know about 
incidents and forwarding those individuals and

28:48.267 --> 29:03.394
their cases to us within the institution. It 
wasn't simply a matter that because they were in a

29:04.176 --> 29:11.068
corps, it was a corps matter and

29:12.584 --> 29:15.530
from their perspective, not an institutional 
matter. So that became a problem for us and a

29:15.550 --> 29:30.542
problem we struggled with for a number of years 
because there was a tendency to believe that if it

29:15.550 --> 29:30.542
happened in the Corps, it ought to be kept quiet and 
in the Corps and not handled by the institution. So

29:31.214 --> 29:32.515
we had to work through that. Ron Blanchley was a key 
in all of that because Ron was primarily our

29:32.956 --> 29:41.724
disciplinary person back in that particular 
time. So that was a major problem that we had to work

29:42.224 --> 29:46.168
through. But in regards to the women, after

29:46.188 --> 29:59.280
leadership positions, then it became

29:46.188 --> 29:59.280
probably it wasn't major item in terms of student 
organizations in the Corps until the females

30:00.290 --> 30:07.026
became juniors. And then Ross Volunteers became a 
major source of the problem for us because Those

30:17.468 --> 30:22.376
individuals to go into the Ross Volunteers were 
selected by upperclassmen. Upperclassmen being

30:22.396 --> 30:30.048
all men had no interest in selecting a female to be a 
member of the Ross Volunteers. So probably that

30:30.068 --> 30:36.017
was the, that came on bigger than anything else. 
Melanie Zingratt was upset for a number of

30:36.598 --> 30:41.586
reasons. one of which was not the Aggie Band, but as 
it played out, she indicated that, in fact, part of

30:42.528 --> 30:58.468
her lawsuit included the Aggie Band, that she had 
not been given the opportunity to participate in

30:42.528 --> 30:58.468
the Aggie Band. That was really stretching her 
case, I thought, because she really had no

30:58.488 --> 31:04.817
interest in music and the band at that time. But at 
least it answered everything for us, and when I say

31:05.357 --> 31:09.042
it answered everything, One of the board members 
who was not an Aggie,

31:09.612 --> 31:18.542
and I mentioned his name in private, you've been 
out in public. One of the board members said in no

31:19.183 --> 31:24.448
way would he ever allow as long as he was on the 
board. He wanted to be in the Aggie band. Now,

31:27.612 --> 31:33.038
Melanie Zantgraff, that's Z-I-N-T-G-R-A-F.
