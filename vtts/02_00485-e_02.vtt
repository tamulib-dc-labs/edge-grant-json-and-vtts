WEBVTT

00:06.342 --> 00:10.207
All the opponents of nuclear power have 
reinforced it.

00:14.173 --> 00:20.842
Now they have made it so difficult that I don't know 
whether Three Mile Island will get started up or

00:14.173 --> 00:20.842
not. If it does, it will cost them so much that it'll 
distort the whole picture insofar as the

00:20.942 --> 00:30.896
economics of nuclear power are concerned. All or 
nothing.

00:36.413 --> 01:06.268
they it ought to be a wonderful lesson to us i think 
we ought to feel we ought to feel great about

00:36.413 --> 01:06.268
nuclear power as a result of three mile island 
because did all the things wrong that you could

00:36.413 --> 01:06.268
hardly do wrong and still the thing took care of 
itself and uh it's gonna well i'd like to see it back

00:36.413 --> 01:06.268
in operation okay now let's go back into history 
and i would like to know about uh more technical

01:06.637 --> 01:07.979
question. What was the size of the staff that you 
had at the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project?

01:13.446 --> 01:16.030
How large was the bureaucracy? Let's see.

01:22.758 --> 01:33.673
I had about 200

01:22.758 --> 01:33.673
people in Washington at the headquarters.

01:39.728 --> 01:59.449
And I had about 500

01:39.728 --> 01:59.449
people at Sandia base.

01:59.469 --> 02:09.600
And maybe another 50 that was scattered Los 
Alamos, Little Moore, Rocky Flats, other sites,

01:59.469 --> 02:09.600
Arco, Nevada.

02:15.723 --> 02:25.938
And then had a contingence of troops and 
maintenance people at all of the weapons storage

02:15.723 --> 02:25.938
sites. And that depended upon the size of the site 
and what had to be guarded. So it was

02:34.871 --> 02:44.785
like 3,000. troops out at the site, troops and 
maintenance personnel. Now can you tell me about

02:51.332 --> 02:59.928
the relations that you had, oh well first, were 
those 3,000, how many were civilians and how many

02:51.332 --> 02:59.928
were military?

03:03.695 --> 03:08.764
All of the people at the sites were military.

03:12.963 --> 03:22.779
All of them at Sandia were military, except maybe

03:12.963 --> 03:22.779
fifty.

03:27.287 --> 03:38.886
Those in headquarters in Washington,

03:27.287 --> 03:38.886
they were about one-third, or about two-thirds 
military. I'm not talking about clerks and

03:39.355 --> 03:42.618
secretaries. I'm talking

03:42.638 --> 03:49.926
about the professional people. Now, how good were 
the relations between the professionals,

03:50.406 --> 04:00.056
civilians, and the military administration? 
Very, very good. Very good. Most of the military

04:03.059 --> 04:08.485
people that we had in Opswap, and in AEC for that 
matter, who

04:09.410 --> 04:27.363
were concerned with command functions or 
technical functions, where personnel were

04:09.410 --> 04:27.363
qualified technically to about the same level 
that the people were in AEC. We had many of them with

04:27.443 --> 04:31.511
PhDs, lots of them with masters. We had nuclear 
physicists, astrophysicists, very highly

04:32.883 --> 04:40.875
qualified military personnel.

04:42.939 --> 04:45.442
So the relationship was very, very good. One thing 
that I was wondering about is that, well, they just

04:47.205 --> 04:59.464
retired Admiral Rickover, and I was wondering if 
you worked on the submarine project and the

04:47.205 --> 04:59.464
development of the nuclear subs. Even though, of 
course, this is Air Force versus Navy, but still.

05:03.803 --> 05:10.831
Well, I worked on it in about three senses, three 
manners. One in the Military Liaison Committee. I

05:13.834 --> 05:25.266
worked with Rickover, whose office was right next 
door in the AEC, in helping him get on with the early

05:13.834 --> 05:25.266
stages of it.

05:26.849 --> 05:49.815
Then later, in Armed Forces Special Weapons 
Project, we had very little to do with effects of a

05:26.849 --> 05:49.815
good many of the things that were going on in the 
submarines, and particularly as it related to

05:26.849 --> 05:49.815
placing nuclear weapons in submarines. So, we did 
quite a bit of work with them on that. Later on, when

05:53.258 --> 06:11.106
I took over the general manager of the commission, 
of course, he was head of the nuclear submarine

05:53.258 --> 06:11.106
division of the reactor development division of 
the staff. And so in that capacity was under the

06:11.606 --> 06:18.557
general manager. And so he submitted his programs 
to me and budgets, and they were all blended into

06:18.773 --> 06:36.511
the reactor development budget and the 
commission budget and defended before the

06:18.773 --> 06:36.511
Congress and wherever. And of course, Rickover 
was quite good before the Congress in his own

06:37.332 --> 06:46.722
defense, but it takes more than Rickover to get his 
money. So for the six years that I was there, I

06:47.056 --> 06:56.425
defended his budget before the Congress, as did 
he.

07:01.809 --> 07:05.092
So I was fairly deeply involved. I've got a whole 
bunch of pictures in there of the launching of one

07:06.113 --> 07:15.662
of the subs in which I participated.

07:20.030 --> 07:26.137
Rickover has his friends and his critics in 
Congress, and he's just been in forced

07:20.030 --> 07:26.137
retirement. It's been said that he was very 
difficult to get along with, especially if you

07:26.898 --> 07:33.745
were on the wrong side of him. What was your 
relationship like? What type of person did you

07:36.588 --> 07:38.210
think he was? Well, I think there's no such thing as 
getting along with Rickover, for anybody, not for

07:40.232 --> 07:47.901
me or for anybody else. The question is... just how 
badly do you get tangled up with him, and can you go

07:49.308 --> 08:00.743
ahead and accomplish what both of you are trying to 
accomplish in spite of that fact? And I think I was

08:02.325 --> 08:04.788
able to do that.

08:10.316 --> 08:14.782
So I think if Rick and I were talking, we'd say the 
same things about each other. I'd have a little

08:14.802 --> 08:17.425
different emphasis than he does. And

08:18.265 --> 08:28.859
I have a great deal of respect for his abilities and 
capabilities in a number of areas. And in some

08:28.879 --> 08:30.621
other areas, I think he's nuts. I suspect he'd say 
the same thing about me. In spite of the fact that he

08:44.793 --> 08:56.169
is very, very good and has done a wonderful job, I 
think, overall for the nation in creating a

08:44.793 --> 08:56.169
nuclear subsurface navy. And I think he has done 
that.

09:02.037 --> 09:08.826
I think he's done a lot of damage to particular to 
other aspects of the armed forces. For example?

09:10.169 --> 09:13.434
For the surface Navy is one example. I'm sure the 
Secretary of the Navy or the Black Shoe Admirals

09:13.715 --> 09:25.534
are not a damn bit happy about a lot of the things 
he's doing. I'm sure of

09:25.554 --> 09:30.422
it. He has pressed the contractors, Rick has, the 
electric boat, the other people who do the work,

09:35.975 --> 09:48.430
but more particularly their subcontractor,

09:35.975 --> 09:48.430
to the point that it's just almost impossible to 
work with them. Well, you can't condemn all of

09:50.273 --> 10:00.345
that, because, and part of it, Rick, is perfectly 
right, and it's shameful, the thing that they get

09:50.273 --> 10:00.345
by with. But it's not all of them, all of the time.

10:08.844 --> 10:13.871
There has to be an accommodation so you can get on 
with your job. But his is a fight from daylight till

10:15.934 --> 10:25.849
dark with any contractor that he's working with.

10:26.030 --> 10:30.957
Most of the naval officers that work with him, 
manning the submarines, just, just

10:31.696 --> 10:37.662
can hardly stomach it at all.

10:40.545 --> 10:43.429
That's not 100% true, but, but I'll know.

10:46.772 --> 11:00.447
My son-in-law in the Navy was called in, in a group 
by Rick to, because he got, got his choice of the top

10:46.772 --> 11:00.447
young officers of the Navy as of any particular 
time. There for some And he was an engineering

11:03.640 --> 11:14.858
officer, my son-in-law, and I called him in and 
examined his qualifications along with others in

11:03.640 --> 11:14.858
that same group. And he was particularly 
belligerent to Rickover on that thing and got

11:17.262 --> 11:26.897
turned down. I haven't seen a happier young man in 
my life, and I found out he got turned down. He

11:32.145 --> 11:40.276
didn't go in there because he sure didn't want 
anything.

11:40.296 --> 11:45.483
It must have been difficult having him for a 
subordinate, having Rickover for a subordinate.

11:48.347 --> 11:53.053
I could usually agree with

11:54.974 --> 12:00.602
with the things that were the Commission's 
responsibility in his job. And he was answering,

12:00.622 --> 12:04.688
of course, to the Department of Defense in his 
other hat. And that's where the real problem

12:04.988 --> 12:11.237
was. Because ours was essentially research and 
development on various aspects of the reactor

12:11.938 --> 12:19.429
itself. the procurement of that reactor and its 
installation and the submarine and the submarine

12:19.595 --> 12:28.926
contract and all that was, that was a defense 
problem. And I'm sure I couldn't have gotten along

12:28.946 --> 12:34.112
with him if I'd had all that responsibility. But we 
gave him support in the nuclear side of the thing

12:34.133 --> 12:45.366
and we were able to agree on what the budget should 
be and how he should run it overall. And having done

12:46.477 --> 12:58.527
that and got it through Congress, I could turn it 
over to him, and then all I had to do was audit it

12:46.477 --> 12:58.527
after that, because he ran it okay, no problem. So 
there was not such a tremendous area of

13:00.929 --> 13:10.217
disagreement for us to get at each other's throat 
about. So we got along fine. And I admire Rickover

13:13.420 --> 13:16.062
in a lot of ways. I think he thinks he knows too damn 
much about too many things, and I think it's always

13:16.733 --> 13:27.405
dangerous when a guy gets himself into that frame 
of mind.

13:30.348 --> 13:34.093
He's an authority on education, among other 
things. He's written a couple of books I have in

13:34.133 --> 13:46.707
there on education, what's wrong with American 
education.

13:48.323 --> 14:17.723
Whether I like him or don't like him, or whether I 
like his characteristics or don't like them, or

13:48.323 --> 14:17.723
whether I think he ought to be in the Navy until he's 
82 or retired 20 years ago, I still have to face the

13:48.323 --> 14:17.723
fact that he has been consistent and persistent 
enough that we, the United States, have a damn good

13:48.323 --> 14:17.723
underwater naval capability.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.874
it badly. And without Rick, I'm not sure we'd have 
it. And so, whatever else I might think about it,

14:24.679 --> 14:31.126
I'm thankful that he was there. How did he ever stay 
in the Navy until he was 82?

14:40.416 --> 14:45.662
He stayed there by one mechanism. He convinced the 
the Joint Committee of the Congress, Joint

14:47.875 --> 15:04.289
Committee on Atomic Energy of the Congress, that 
he was right and the Navy was wrong,

14:47.875 --> 15:04.289
and they promoted him the first time. They forced 
the Navy to promote him and kept him on there. He

15:10.895 --> 15:16.600
took advantage of that, and he kept the Congress

15:17.609 --> 15:22.433
fully informed at all times, Congress being the 
joint committee primarily.

15:25.416 --> 15:44.494
And he became very close friends of people who were 
chairmen of the joint committee, Senator

15:25.416 --> 15:44.494
Anderson from New Mexico and Congressman 
Holifield from California, who kind of

15:25.416 --> 15:44.494
alternated the chairmanship.

15:45.115 --> 15:51.821
He became a very close friend of Senator Cannon 
from Missouri, head of the Appropriations

15:45.115 --> 15:51.821
Committee. And Senator Cannon ran that goddamn 
Congress for a mighty long time. And there didn't

16:01.630 --> 16:06.775
anybody dispute his authority either. And this 
carried on. So it's the Congress that has kept Rick

16:14.731 --> 16:15.672
in his job. They've supported his program. 
They've listened to him talk. We've gotten

16:22.100 --> 16:27.686
somewhat of a kick out of it, and they have forced 
the Navy to keep him on. They had to promote—the

16:27.706 --> 16:39.260
Congress promoted him from captain to rear 
admiral, and they promoted him to vice admiral,

16:27.706 --> 16:39.260
and they have kept him on active duty all this time. 
Not the Department of Defense, but the Congress.

16:43.958 --> 16:59.037
And he's used everything in his power to do that, 
even capitalizing a little bit on the fact that

16:43.958 --> 16:59.037
he's Jewish and a little anti-Semitism that 
somebody can dream up.

17:02.902 --> 17:04.865
He's pretty good at some of these things. You heard 
him yesterday talking to Proxmire, I guess, and

17:06.067 --> 17:11.113
telling him about it. Well, that's your fault. You 
gave them the money.

17:18.474 --> 17:22.278
I wanted to have just your opinion on the neutron 
bomb.

17:25.843 --> 17:27.605
I mean, whether we should have it or not? Well, yes, 
the neutron bomb is not new. No.

17:38.144 --> 17:42.630
people thought about it even before I was involved 
in the atomic energy business. And that principle

17:42.730 --> 17:49.219
has been under test for quite a long time. And it was 
finally developed so that it, as a practical

17:51.322 --> 18:00.655
weapon, could be used. And its effect has been 
explained.

18:05.178 --> 18:19.681
So it becomes now a question of, is that an effect 
that we need in our arsenal

18:05.178 --> 18:19.681
in the current position we're in in the world 
vis-a-vis the Soviet Union? And I think the answer

18:21.203 --> 18:23.627
to that is clearly yes. I think we ought to make it 
and stockpile it, regardless of what the hell

18:25.149 --> 18:29.937
anybody else thinks. And if a time ever comes that 
we need to use it in our own interest, use it,

18:30.946 --> 18:41.023
whether anybody else likes it or not.

18:45.631 --> 18:56.329
Because Western Europe, Italy,

18:45.631 --> 18:56.329
or I shouldn't cite Italy, any of them over there,

18:59.498 --> 19:07.211
We're going to be hauling louder than anybody else 
if the time comes and we need to use it and we don't

18:59.498 --> 19:07.211
have it. How come you didn't have it? So it's a good 
weapon and it's for a good purpose. It's one we need

19:15.504 --> 19:19.971
in our arsenal and I think we ought to get on with it. 
Okay. Now I want to go back and I want to ask you about

19:20.172 --> 19:25.320
the development of storage sites for atomic 
weapons. At first we didn't have any atomic

19:25.756 --> 19:30.664
weapons and then we started to develop them. What 
were the problems with building storage sites?

19:33.568 --> 19:36.233
How did we pick storage sites?

19:39.798 --> 19:48.372
Well, there were really two major problems 
initially I'm talking about.

19:52.705 --> 20:22.662
One was how did one store these so that

19:52.705 --> 20:22.662
it would be almost impossible for anyone to get 
access to them, either to take them, that is, take

19:52.705 --> 20:22.662
them because we're the only ones in the world who 
had them at that time, take them from a secrecy

19:52.705 --> 20:22.662
standpoint,

20:23.992 --> 20:37.866
And how could you prevent access to them by anyone 
who wanted to use them for some other purpose,

20:23.992 --> 20:37.866
such as terror or blackmail or whatnot?

20:41.727 --> 21:03.701
And how could you protect them from a major 
situation in which there was limited invasion or

20:41.727 --> 21:03.701
insurrection or something in which there was a 
force available to try to take them by force?

21:03.721 --> 21:09.270
And of course, the other thing, the other major 
consideration at the time Under what conditions

21:10.651 --> 21:25.215
do you store them so that if there was an accidental 
detonation, the least amount of damage would be

21:10.651 --> 21:25.215
done? Damage to people, to the surrounding 
country, to the installation itself, to any other

21:27.559 --> 21:37.435
weapon that you would have?

21:41.262 --> 22:05.958
So the answer to all of these, the best answer 
anyone could come up with, turned out to be

21:41.262 --> 22:05.958
cutting back into mountains, into solid rock, 
with chambers to store these under controlled

21:41.262 --> 22:05.958
conditions of humidity, temperature, and this 
sort of thing. Places where they could be secured

22:14.017 --> 22:29.820
individually in

22:14.017 --> 22:29.820
their compartments, in an area that was large 
enough that if something happened to this one, the

22:14.017 --> 22:29.820
one next to it wouldn't be affected, and so on. And 
then to enclose the entire area and guard it in a

22:31.742 --> 22:42.758
manner to deny access to the site, even though 
people presumably when they got on site couldn't

22:43.210 --> 22:52.058
get into the individual storage locations.

22:57.583 --> 23:03.189
So this was, that's the way it was accomplished. 
Now are these sites, are they top secret, or can you

23:03.209 --> 23:07.893
tell me where some of those are? No, I don't know. 
what their classification are now. As a matter of

23:18.035 --> 23:23.064
fact, I don't even know where they are now. So 
they've changed over the years? That's good. Oh,

23:26.971 --> 23:29.235
yeah. Why do they change them? I mean, if they have a 
successful site or one that's secure. Well, they

23:33.622 --> 23:34.865
haven't changed them all. I don't mean that. 
They've produced a lot of weapons since I got out of

23:38.392 --> 23:43.019
the business, so I don't know where they have put 
them. And that's good, I don't want them. But they

23:46.724 --> 24:01.587
are located usually within a few miles of 
locations from which they're going to be used. Oh,

24:02.548 --> 24:03.910
I see. from the major missile launch areas, from 
the major sack areas, from the major attack areas.

24:17.516 --> 24:19.158
So there are a number of sites. I built five while I 
was in Nashua because it was our job to find them,

24:19.439 --> 24:33.559
build them, occupy them, take custody of weapons 
and put them in them and see that they stay there.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.183
see that they were maintained and ready to go.

24:40.347 --> 24:42.129
So I built five of the five. The one everyone knows 
about, I suspect, is near Albuquerque, the first

24:42.149 --> 24:48.776
one. It's

24:49.137 --> 24:55.224
still there, and I'm sure it's still occupied. 
Now, why did you leave the Armed Forces Special

24:57.006 --> 25:03.073
Weapons Project? Was your tour of duty on? Yes, it 
was. See I had been in there

25:08.451 --> 25:17.068
nearly six years, about that. And I had been the 
deputy and then I became the chief and it was time to

25:17.088 --> 25:26.867
do something else.

25:29.311 --> 25:35.499
Well, were you happy with your next assignment as 
the commander, Joint Task Force 7, Nuclear Test

25:29.311 --> 25:35.499
Organization? Yes, very. Very. Yeah, it was a very 
good assignment, a very, very rough problem. One

25:46.874 --> 25:50.559
that would be extremely difficult to handle. Now, 
why were you only there a year? because that's how

25:53.020 --> 25:56.845
long it took to do it. We finished the job. Okay. 
Let's talk about that. What were your

26:01.912 --> 26:03.394
responsibilities?

26:06.438 --> 26:19.095
The

26:06.438 --> 26:19.095
Joint Task Force, in this case Joint Task Force 
Seven,

26:06.438 --> 26:19.095
has the job of testing

26:21.843 --> 26:36.022
overseas, it doesn't operate within the United 
States, such weapons and devices as the Atomic

26:21.843 --> 26:36.022
Energy Commission and the Secretary of Defense 
might direct.

26:39.347 --> 26:46.416
This one was primarily a development test program 
to be conducted and

26:47.206 --> 27:06.496
primarily in Inuitak, although also included 
Bikini and Kwajalein, and as it turned out,

26:47.206 --> 27:06.496
Johnson Island, before we got through.

27:06.516 --> 27:12.606
The emphasis of the testing was on medium- and 
high-yield thermonuclear devices to determine

27:14.459 --> 27:42.711
their characteristics and decide which ones 
would go into production for what purposes and in

27:14.459 --> 27:42.711
what configurations, as well as to get a number of 
weapons effects, many of the weapons effects. two

27:43.990 --> 27:57.937
of the detonations were to be conducted at high 
altitude,

27:43.990 --> 27:57.937
primarily for effects purposes, although we were 
also testing the devices.

28:02.786 --> 28:03.788
And they worked. I've forgotten how many tests 
were conducted in that series, but it was like 38 or

28:05.523 --> 28:12.750
40.

28:22.500 --> 28:26.845
What were the major—what did you learn from these 
tests? The major? What did you learn from these

28:27.766 --> 28:31.750
tests and the new information?

28:42.766 --> 29:03.273
From the standpoint of development of the 
weapons,

28:42.766 --> 29:03.273
it is so highly technical and is a

28:42.766 --> 29:03.273
space and time there that I would have to go back and 
refresh myself

28:42.766 --> 29:03.273
to be specific about. But we moved to stockpile 
after those tests. with several warheads that

29:09.749 --> 29:27.775
were firmed up as a result of those taps, so that we 
knew exactly what their configuration was,

29:09.749 --> 29:27.775
exactly what their yield was, and exactly what 
their effects were, so that we could then put them

29:28.480 --> 29:35.149
into a weapons system, establish those weapons 
characteristics, and go to production. That was,

29:36.090 --> 29:44.060
of course, the real big achievement of the test 
series.

29:44.081 --> 29:53.593
We had many weapons effects programs that either 
confirmed or developed a

29:54.721 --> 29:59.006
information we needed to further our weapons 
effects business. And the one at high altitude

30:01.069 --> 30:15.868
gave us the effects on the ionosphere and on the 
atmosphere and

30:01.069 --> 30:15.868
answered many technical questions.

30:18.751 --> 30:25.439
I think eliminated the need for further testing up 
there and certainly took away any doubts about

30:18.751 --> 30:25.439
what it did. One

30:27.401 --> 30:46.142
thing I wanted to ask was what weapon systems, new 
weapon systems resulted from your test at Joint

30:46.831 --> 30:53.360
Task Force

30:46.831 --> 30:53.360
7. Can you talk about that? I think that there 
probably were none that you could say this

30:55.883 --> 31:03.273
resulted directly from this test. Weapons 
systems take many years and many considerations

31:03.433 --> 31:11.284
and probably usually many tests. And so while this 
one

31:17.695 --> 31:23.403
conform many aspects or develop many new planning 
factors and things like that. As far as I can

31:23.443 --> 31:31.775
remember right now, it didn't develop a 
particular weapon system. It

31:31.855 --> 31:40.648
cannot come as a result of one test.

31:42.940 --> 31:53.610
It gave us the information we needed to make the 
decisions as to what warheads to put on several

31:42.940 --> 31:53.610
weapons and weapons systems.

31:59.915 --> 32:03.599
But of course it's only one element of such a 
decision.

32:06.321 --> 32:07.262
Why did you retire? From the Air Force? Yes. Well, I 
was asked to take this job as general manager of AEC

32:12.083 --> 32:30.122
by people that I had a great deal of respect for. Mr. 
Strauss, who was chairman of the AEC at that time,

32:30.142 --> 32:39.492
Louis Strauss, and John McCone, who was coming in 
to be chairman shortly, and by President

32:40.012 --> 32:48.743
Eisenhower, who was president at the time. And it 
was a, to me, a real challenge in terms of my earlier

32:50.405 --> 33:00.838
decisions and earlier experience. And I wanted to 
know whether I could do something outside of the

33:03.164 --> 33:10.775
military because I hadn't had really an 
opportunity to find out.

33:14.421 --> 33:22.172
So I debated it hard and

33:14.421 --> 33:22.172
finally decided to do it. Whether it was a good 
thing to do, I haven't any idea because I went to see

33:28.308 --> 33:35.922
General White, who was Chief of Staff of the Air 
Force at that time, to see if he would honor my

33:28.308 --> 33:35.922
request for early retirement.

33:39.108 --> 33:50.468
He entreated me not to do it, and pointed out that I 
wasn't doing so bad in the Air Force, which I

33:39.108 --> 33:50.468
certainly had to agree with.

33:53.907 --> 34:02.256
there were a number of new assignments and 
promotions coming up right then, right

33:53.907 --> 34:02.256
immediately.

34:04.919 --> 34:10.325
And I feel sure that I would have been one of them had 
I stayed in. Of course, what the field doesn't

34:10.345 --> 34:22.058
amount to very much, because I understand you 
don't know the answer to it, but

34:10.345 --> 34:22.058
I think I would have been placed in either the 
Logistics Command or the Development Command and

34:22.713 --> 34:31.585
promoted to three stars probably by the end of that 
year. But I didn't stay for that. I decided to go

34:35.471 --> 34:49.210
ahead and retire early and take this other job 
because you cannot, by law, occupy that position,

34:35.471 --> 34:49.210
statutory position.

34:50.776 --> 34:57.707
while you retain your status as an active duty 
officer in the armed services. So I had to retire in

34:57.727 --> 35:02.914
order to qualify under the law to take the job. Do 
you regret retiring? Do you regret retiring? You

35:08.443 --> 35:10.506
might have been able to make four stars. You 
certainly were young enough. I feel confident

35:12.721 --> 35:14.564
that I would have. I was young enough and I was in the 
right spot and I had the right head start and

35:14.724 --> 35:27.101
everything else, so I think yes, I would have made 
four stars all right.

35:27.121 --> 35:29.424
I wouldn't have had a lot of the experiences that I 
had. I might have had some that were more

35:30.225 --> 35:34.031
interesting, I don't know, but I doubt it.

35:37.416 --> 35:39.919
But I don't regret anything.

35:42.785 --> 35:46.890
in that respect.

35:53.739 --> 36:02.110
I have to look back and say that's the decision and I 
went on and did the best I could in light of that

35:53.739 --> 36:02.110
decision and that I think was

36:05.431 --> 36:10.717
credible and very interesting, so I don't regret 
it. Can you tell me about your retirement

36:10.737 --> 36:12.820
ceremony?

36:15.543 --> 36:29.920
There really wasn't one, because I was

36:15.543 --> 36:29.920
not in Washington at the time when there could have 
been a but they had normally over at Bowling Air

36:31.621 --> 36:35.988
Force Base. And the change was being made in the 
commission, or had been made, chairman change.

36:48.108 --> 36:54.658
And because I couldn't get there in time, they had a 
man acting in my place as general manager and were

36:48.108 --> 36:54.658
anxious for me to get on board. So I went right from 
the Joint Task Force one day to the AEC the next day

36:56.090 --> 37:01.558
and took over General Manager. There weren't all 
retirement ceremonies.

37:09.609 --> 37:12.894
Let's talk about this job as General Manager.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.064
How large was the AEC at this time? What size, what 
type of responsibilities are we discussing?

37:26.549 --> 37:46.476
Well,

37:26.549 --> 37:46.476
AACSNO operated

37:26.549 --> 37:46.476
with

37:26.549 --> 37:46.476
a minimum number of government personnel and a 
major effort with contractors.

37:49.580 --> 37:54.767
So, I think it would be almost impossible to

37:56.907 --> 38:25.783
We have a number of people in contractors, but

37:56.907 --> 38:25.783
if we took the three points, about 4,000 people in 
AEC,

37:56.907 --> 38:25.783
a little over $4 billion budget, and like 300,000 
people under contract. That would give a measure

38:25.898 --> 38:29.642
of magnitude. That's about what it was. This is 
more a responsibility than you ever had in your

38:33.546 --> 38:37.149
life then. Yes. Did you enjoy the new position? 
Well, enjoy is

38:41.174 --> 38:47.200
perhaps not the right word.

38:50.003 --> 38:52.345
It was so big, so quick. that I didn't have time for 
anything except work and keep my head above water.

39:06.238 --> 39:10.703
I took the job the first of December 1958.

39:12.826 --> 39:21.336
Congress back in session by early January and four 
billion dollars worth of budget to defend It takes

39:23.003 --> 39:25.505
a lot of doing. And so I would really cover it up very 
fast. And of course, the activities are still

39:29.569 --> 39:35.375
going full underway while you defend the budget. 
So operating problems were terrific.

39:45.084 --> 39:47.085
And of course, I was new to the commission. The 
people in it who were operating didn't know my

39:47.126 --> 39:51.930
policies or my views or whatnot. So it was a really 
hectic, busy time for me. I spent about 15, 16 hours

39:59.940 --> 40:05.765
a day at it for the first year at least.

40:08.468 --> 40:16.195
I want to talk about the issues or the major 
problems in the AEC at that time that you were

40:08.468 --> 40:16.195
directly involved with. What were some of the 
issues or headaches? Well, they

40:25.542 --> 40:36.255
Promotion of application of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes, of course, is the primary

40:25.542 --> 40:36.255
mission. And everywhere you turn there are people 
fighting this objective. So just keeping the

40:42.203 --> 40:49.312
fires put out was a hell of a job all by itself. Are 
these people the environmentalists? Well, it

40:51.749 --> 40:54.271
includes those. It's not limited to those. It 
includes all kinds of people. One group that's

40:59.256 --> 41:07.725
particularly troublesome that it includes is a 
bunch of so-called scientists, or people who call

40:59.256 --> 41:07.725
themselves scientists. They haven't been really 
successful on the positive side. So they go to the

41:13.590 --> 41:20.237
negative side to make themselves heard. And some 
of them work for you, you, the commission.

41:28.125 --> 41:30.529
This creates real troublesome problems.

41:45.452 --> 41:47.094
What was your question directed? We were talking 
about the issues and the problems. One you said

41:51.065 --> 41:53.168
were the scientists. That went across the board, 
of course. The real issues were on the positive

41:55.993 --> 42:07.210
side, of course, with power reactors, 
development of power reactors, power

41:55.993 --> 42:07.210
applications. At the same time, we were 
developing the ram chip for military

42:08.632 --> 42:17.967
application.

42:20.714 --> 42:28.905
Isotopes,

42:20.714 --> 42:28.905
tremendous amount of work with isotopes. We're 
getting started well on fusion power,

42:28.925 --> 42:40.700
about 30 million a year on that at that time.

42:44.144 --> 42:48.510
The increase in capacity of the diffusion plants 
Which is a really major problem.

42:56.018 --> 42:59.424
And electricity or power for those plants.

43:02.549 --> 43:06.896
Because at one time we were using one-tenth of all 
the power generated in the United States. No

43:07.958 --> 43:09.600
kidding.

43:11.363 --> 43:14.128
That's a pretty big magnitude of thing. That's for 
sure. And weapons and weapons testing, of course.

43:22.552 --> 43:32.149
It was always there and it was always a really

43:22.552 --> 43:32.149
big issue in one form or another the whole time.

43:41.815 --> 43:47.482
That covers an awful lot of ground that I've just 
said there. Those could be broken down into dozens

43:49.084 --> 44:10.489
and dozens of issues, such as

43:49.084 --> 44:10.489
providing the facilities for high energy physics 
and low energy physics, the roles of the

43:49.084 --> 44:10.489
universities and educational institutions. in 
the AC. How did Texas A&M get a cyclotron, for

44:14.961 --> 44:21.074
example? That came out of this consideration 
during that time.

44:28.789 --> 44:31.354
Well, let's start in on some of these. What about 
Plowshare? Placere was another of the issues

44:34.162 --> 44:43.833
here, and of course Placere was the use of nuclear 
explosives for peaceful purposes. Our primary

44:45.354 --> 45:01.232
effort there was directed at the use of the 
explosives to move earth, such as you would do to

44:45.354 --> 45:01.232
dig a new Panama Canal, for example.

45:05.735 --> 45:23.507
And by the time I left the commission and the 
program closed down shortly after that, the

45:05.735 --> 45:23.507
techniques and technology had been developed 
adequately to use nuclear explosives to do many

45:05.735 --> 45:23.507
peaceful things. It's never possible to remove 
all of the radioactivity and the other

45:25.681 --> 45:36.746
considerations that go with it from that process.

45:39.653 --> 45:44.584
And with the rising opposition to nuclear...
