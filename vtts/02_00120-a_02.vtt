WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:11.016
Were there any doctoral students in those days, or was it all master's level, those few graduate students?

00:11.036 --> 00:13.782
They gave one or two Ph.D.

00:13.862 --> 00:23.642
degrees at that time, and they were so bad, I didn't want any part of them.

00:23.791 --> 00:37.029
All right, so as you recall, some of the early key forward steps were these Welch grants and getting a little more funding and so forth.

00:37.089 --> 00:38.611
That's right.

00:38.631 --> 00:38.931
All right.

00:38.971 --> 00:48.364
What were some of the accomplishments that led you to feel that progress was being made, that you all were moving forward?

00:50.673 --> 00:59.182
Fred Jensen was the department head, and he was not, in my honest opinion, a very good chemist himself.

00:59.322 --> 01:01.484
But I will say this for him.

01:02.826 --> 01:10.454
He stretched what little money he had about as well as any department head in those days could.

01:11.935 --> 01:19.043
But he had almost no funds except to support their undergraduate teaching.

01:22.162 --> 01:25.965
And describe your duties in those first years.

01:26.046 --> 01:29.329
What courses did you teach and what are your responsibilities?

01:29.449 --> 01:32.872
About the first five years, I only taught freshman chemistry.

01:33.753 --> 01:46.364
And that wasn't exactly what I would have liked, but it wasn't the worst thing either because I enjoyed classroom teaching.

01:46.464 --> 01:48.406
I've always enjoyed that.

01:49.087 --> 01:50.548
The problem was...

01:51.187 --> 02:06.300
that about the second or third year I was here, I found out that I had the largest student contact hours of any person at NM, any faculty member.

02:07.601 --> 02:13.906
I had lots of classes, freshman chemistry class, lots of sections.

02:15.548 --> 02:20.552
And I could find little time

02:20.988 --> 02:24.872
to get in my research laboratory and even get anything started.

02:26.753 --> 02:31.257
Was there a normal assignment hour load in those days?

02:32.759 --> 02:33.419
Do you remember?

02:33.920 --> 02:50.775
Yes, there was, and I can't remember exactly what it was, but during the week, as I remember, I would meet something like 35 hours of classes.

02:51.211 --> 02:54.354
So were you the only freshman chemistry?

02:54.914 --> 02:55.094
No.

02:55.134 --> 03:06.024
We had, you see, a tremendous number of entering students that needed freshman chemistry in their various studies.

03:08.546 --> 03:12.149
Typically, they were majoring in what, those taking chemistry?

03:12.709 --> 03:14.531
Well, we taught chemical engineers.

03:14.631 --> 03:16.412
They all took freshman chemistry.

03:17.493 --> 03:20.796
Biology students all took freshman chemistry.

03:21.080 --> 03:42.109
All the science majors, physicists, all took freshman chemistry, physics majors, and then a bunch of the departments in the College of Agriculture, entomology and

03:43.793 --> 03:47.940
Soil science and all of those people took freshman chemistry.

03:48.421 --> 03:54.631
We had a tremendous number of students that we had to take care of.

03:56.214 --> 04:04.688
Describe some of your learning experience as a new instructor at Texas A&M, new assistant professor.

04:05.005 --> 04:11.031
Well, I'd never done any teaching before and I didn't quite know what I was getting into.

04:12.693 --> 04:31.772
And I didn't realize at all that back in those days, particularly, our entering freshmen students either had never had any chemistry whatsoever or had had one of the worst kinds of experiences in high school chemistry imaginable

04:32.292 --> 04:39.019
to the point where it would have been better had they not had any previous chemistry courses.

04:40.020 --> 04:44.625
And they came into chemistry courses at A&M frightened to death.

04:47.628 --> 05:01.843
And it was so bad that the first class each semester that I met a freshman section

05:03.106 --> 05:09.314
I would give them a simple exam in simple mathematics.

05:12.499 --> 05:21.931
Most of them couldn't handle, could not convert a fraction to a decimal or the reverse.

05:22.912 --> 05:30.042
Had no concept of powers of 10 and things of that sort.

05:31.220 --> 05:46.579
and could not look at a simple mathematical equation where you're multiplying, dividing various numbers.

05:47.875 --> 06:01.578
could not look at that equation and have a system for making a reasonable guess at what the answer would be.

06:03.561 --> 06:13.157
The quizzes that we gave in freshman chemistry always had some problems involved.

06:15.095 --> 06:20.042
These were not terribly complicated problems, but the kids did know how to use slide rules.

06:21.724 --> 06:31.918
And any decent problem required a fair amount of time for doing the calculations.

06:31.998 --> 06:40.410
So what I always did was to say, you do not have to get the exact answer.

06:41.318 --> 06:45.166
correct answer on these problems.

06:45.567 --> 07:01.099
I want you to look at the numbers and in your head figure out a way, and I showed them how to do it, convert everything to powers of ten, all the numbers,

07:02.480 --> 07:24.100
and how you could then multiply and divide powers of ten, and look at the first part of the powers of ten number, and if you were multiplying five by fifteen, you could do this in your head, you know, and come out with a

07:24.535 --> 07:33.206
an answer and I, anybody that got within 10% of the right answer got full credit.

07:33.266 --> 07:50.809
It wasn't a math course, it was a chemistry course and we were trying to teach them how you could do calculations with precision if you had the ability to do the calculations and the time to do it.

07:52.992 --> 07:53.833
But

07:55.957 --> 08:09.910
This was a real bummer for me because these entering kids had never been taught enough mathematics in a high school to do simple calculations.

08:11.454 --> 08:14.100
And that's one of the first things we had to teach them.

08:15.582 --> 08:26.775
In those early years, did you learn to identify any veteran faculty member that you sometimes turned to for advice, counsel, experience?

08:30.800 --> 08:43.615
Over the years, even back in those early days, sure, there were people, one or two in the chemistry department, but mainly in other parts of the campus,

08:43.814 --> 08:45.478
Wayne Hall I got to know.

08:45.518 --> 08:46.780
I'm not sure.

08:46.820 --> 08:53.013
Looking back, I was trying to think, how did I get to know Wayne Hall so early?

08:53.034 --> 08:54.677
Under what conditions?

08:54.857 --> 08:59.427
I guess he was in soil science, I believe, at that time.

08:59.980 --> 09:06.452
and was one of the real good people over there in the School of Agriculture.

09:07.354 --> 09:18.073
And shortly after I arrived, he was made dean of the graduate school not too long after.

09:18.113 --> 09:23.423
I'll tell you one or two other little things that'll kind of lead up to this.

09:25.563 --> 09:39.079
I had left Monsanto because I wanted to be a scientist and I did not have any desire to be a desk person.

09:41.242 --> 09:51.594
It wasn't because I didn't like it, it was because I liked being in the laboratory a lot better, not more.

09:51.614 --> 09:54.878
And I hadn't been

09:56.208 --> 10:00.074
at A&M more than about two years, three years.

10:01.816 --> 10:11.991
And somebody from the College of Arts and Sciences called me, and I don't remember who they were, and said, offer me a job as an associate dean.

10:14.435 --> 10:16.538
And I couldn't believe this in the first place.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.266
And I turned it down, graciously, I hope.

10:24.220 --> 10:33.275
And I was criticized pretty bitterly by some of the other people around the campus who said, you turned down a job as an associate dean?

10:33.796 --> 10:34.718
What's wrong with you?

10:35.940 --> 10:40.207
And I said, well, what's wrong with me is I like to be a scientist.

10:42.251 --> 10:44.394
And I enjoy that more than anything else.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.962
I truly enjoyed being in my research laboratory.

10:49.921 --> 11:04.808
I worked with my graduate students doing experiments alongside of them, and this was my way of training them how to carry out reactions and things like that.

11:10.964 --> 11:17.392
I'm not sure how long I've been here, but not too long, and Dean Hall called me.

11:17.412 --> 11:23.159
Oh, Dean Hall, first of all, put me on a committee fairly soon after I got here.

11:23.179 --> 11:28.365
And we had become close friends and liked one another very much.

11:29.587 --> 11:39.098
And he called me over to his office one day, and he said, we have a real problem.

11:39.078 --> 11:51.178
The College of Agriculture has a lot of research activities going on, but the quality is very, very poor.

11:51.198 --> 12:05.322
I want you and certain other people to form a committee to review all research proposals in the College of Agriculture.

12:07.546 --> 12:14.118
and send me a recommendation on every one of them."

12:14.138 --> 12:20.971
And he said, I hope we can up the quality of what they're doing over there, what they were doing at times.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.181
They would give a student a job.

12:26.221 --> 12:30.128
They had gotten some money,

12:30.530 --> 12:34.915
from some fertilizer company, for instance.

12:34.935 --> 12:48.612
And the students' research was to go out on the ag campus and lay out plots, square plots, a whole bunch of them.

12:49.273 --> 12:56.942
And in one plot, you put so much nitrogen fertilizer and so much phosphorus and change all these up.

12:58.542 --> 13:26.710
and you would then plant corn or some plant in there, and when everything came up, the determination, the test for determining which fertilizer combinations was best was to cut the corn off at ground level and weigh it.

13:31.162 --> 13:39.754
No measure of whether the corn was nice and green or was yellow from chlorosis and things of that sort.

13:41.156 --> 13:49.628
And these were things that any high school graduate or high school senior could do.

13:51.310 --> 13:53.153
There was no skill involved.

13:54.044 --> 13:59.112
in the poultry science department.

13:59.152 --> 14:01.816
They were carrying out experiments over there.

14:01.836 --> 14:08.806
They would get feed from feed companies and some money to do these experiments.

14:08.826 --> 14:18.381
They would feed a bunch of chickens various feeds and measure

14:20.133 --> 14:24.800
how color, how yellow the yolk of the egg was.

14:26.002 --> 14:29.688
Now there are chemicals in the yolk that make it yellow.

14:30.570 --> 14:34.656
That's what you should be measuring if that's your test.

14:36.198 --> 14:39.103
But that's the kind of research that was going on.

14:40.636 --> 14:48.885
And after the first few years at A&M, you asked me a question that can be answered like this.

14:48.925 --> 14:52.049
I began to wonder, what in the hell are you doing here?

14:53.711 --> 14:59.056
But I knew before I came to A&M what I was getting into.

14:59.076 --> 15:04.002
I knew A&M was not a quality university.

15:05.644 --> 15:08.567
But my reasoning was I thought a simple one.

15:09.712 --> 15:18.642
I had gotten two degrees from the University of Texas, elegant teaching in the chemistry department.

15:18.662 --> 15:24.089
Everything over at the University of Texas was quality in those days.

15:26.011 --> 15:30.656
They were the best graduate school in the entire South in chemistry.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.382
They got their money

15:36.172 --> 15:40.699
from the same source that A&M got its money in the state legislature.

15:42.201 --> 16:03.192
And somebody was asleep at the switch at A&M, was my conclusion, that they weren't getting the kind of funds they needed, and then somebody hiring the administration was asleep at the switch because they weren't going out of their way trying to hire quality faculty.

16:04.741 --> 16:08.405
Now, when you arrived, who was the Dean of Arts and Sciences?

16:09.026 --> 16:09.687
Delaplane.

16:10.127 --> 16:10.928
Dr. Delaplane.

16:12.270 --> 16:12.430
Yeah.

16:12.891 --> 16:23.684
And then the, what today would be the Provost, the Vice President of Academic Affairs, that's before Wayne Hall was in that slot.

16:23.704 --> 16:26.327
Who was, remember who the Vice President was?

16:28.703 --> 16:32.351
I don't even remember that they had one, but probably they did.

16:32.531 --> 16:33.934
Was Morgan the president yet?

16:34.395 --> 16:38.143
Morgan was the president that was here the day I arrived.

16:38.604 --> 16:41.370
He only lasted about two years.

16:42.172 --> 16:44.417
What was your perception of him?

16:44.684 --> 16:48.550
He and I became the very best of friends very quickly.

16:51.775 --> 17:02.992
He would call me over to his office and we would talk about what A&M ought to be and what directions we should go.

17:03.032 --> 17:12.767
And I'm sure there were other people he called in like this too, but we were

17:13.135 --> 17:20.466
I told him frankly, A&M is one of the poorest universities that I know of.

17:20.486 --> 17:29.399
And certainly in the state of Texas, compared to the University of Texas, there's no comparison, no comparison whatsoever.

17:31.463 --> 17:36.150
And so he was finally fired, you know.

17:36.851 --> 17:40.476
Now he, didn't he have some plans for how he hoped

17:40.760 --> 17:42.202
to move A&M forward?

17:42.222 --> 17:44.806
Absolutely, and those plans didn't meet.

17:45.327 --> 17:48.251
And what was in those, as far as you know?

17:48.511 --> 17:55.101
Well, it was primarily get out and find the very best faculty.

17:55.501 --> 18:05.215
You can bring in your young people, give them the facilities to do a job, get some more money from the state legislature.

18:07.372 --> 18:09.034
Basically, that was it.

18:09.054 --> 18:13.020
Wasn't he also considering moving for co-education?

18:14.021 --> 18:16.805
We did not talk about that at that time.

18:17.285 --> 18:20.590
Didn't he make the Corps optional for a couple of years?

18:21.471 --> 18:22.152
Somebody did.

18:24.675 --> 18:27.419
Yes, they did, but I don't believe it was Morgan.

18:28.060 --> 18:29.441
Morgan didn't last long.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.408
Do you have any idea what caused him not to survive here?

18:36.076 --> 18:37.478
I have feelings.

18:39.701 --> 18:50.096
There were people higher in the administration, the chancellor and the board of directors, but mainly the chancellor.

18:53.961 --> 18:55.123
That was Dr. Harrington then?

18:55.143 --> 19:00.450
That was Dr. Harrington, good old chemistry prof originally.

19:02.233 --> 19:05.998
But most of these people, and Harrington was one of them,

19:06.518 --> 19:07.902
in my honest opinion.

19:09.106 --> 19:17.130
They were too busy looking, protecting their rear, and were not willing to stick their necks out one bit.

19:18.876 --> 19:19.718
And any

19:20.103 --> 19:29.913
radical proposal, or what may not have been radical at all, but any proposal that was different.

19:31.254 --> 19:38.641
The Aggies in those days, I talked one day, a good friend of mine was the head of the chemical engineering department.

19:40.023 --> 19:47.950
And this is pretty typical of the feeling around the campus.

19:48.050 --> 19:48.591
He said,

19:50.512 --> 19:56.459
We only hire A&M graduates in chemistry, chemical engineering.

19:56.499 --> 20:01.905
We know how good they are, and we don't take a chance on anybody else.

20:02.486 --> 20:08.352
And I said, you've got to be kidding.

20:08.773 --> 20:16.722
You can only bring in new and fresh ideas and different ideas by going outside of this school.

20:17.731 --> 20:21.577
rule should be we don't hire any A&M graduates.

20:21.638 --> 20:31.975
We try to get as many graduates from other colleges and universities across the country as we can and pick the best you can find.

20:33.317 --> 20:34.780
But that was the attitude.

20:36.062 --> 20:39.267
A&M is a good school,

20:39.989 --> 20:41.912
and we don't want to change what we're doing.

20:42.372 --> 20:43.714
That was the attitude.

20:44.655 --> 20:55.350
Now, what were the notable first steps in changing all this, as far as you were aware, particularly in the chemistry area?

20:55.370 --> 21:00.957
Nothing good happened until Earl Rudder showed up, really.

21:03.260 --> 21:06.705
When they kicked

21:08.255 --> 21:11.019
Morgan out.

21:11.740 --> 21:17.527
That was my one best hope, and it went down the drain.

21:19.049 --> 21:23.716
And I was about ready to bail out and look somewhere else.

21:25.979 --> 21:27.681
And Earl Rudder showed up.

21:28.927 --> 21:32.495
And were you here at that time Earl showed up?

21:32.796 --> 21:38.268
I got here, he got here, I think January 1, 59, and I came that fall.

21:39.190 --> 21:43.680
Well, then you recognized the rough spots that he went through.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.125
Earl was...

21:46.325 --> 21:49.089
was a military man, and that's the way he thought.

21:50.672 --> 21:56.300
And he didn't know how to operate in an academic arena.

21:57.121 --> 22:03.331
And he did some stupid things in faculty meetings, as you know.

22:03.791 --> 22:14.948
You may have been at the faculty meeting where he told anybody there that didn't like what was here, the road went, Highway 6 ran both directions.

22:16.025 --> 22:17.127
Get on it and leave.

22:17.227 --> 22:25.159
Well, his basic idea was all right, but the way he did it was terrible.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.948
And I think at that, after that particular faculty meeting, I sat down.

22:32.530 --> 22:36.516
I don't know when, I've never known when to keep my mouth shut very well.

22:37.057 --> 22:43.787
And so I sat down and wrote him about a one-page letter and said, President Rutter,

22:45.556 --> 22:53.254
Some of the things that you said did not go over at all well with the faculty.

22:55.647 --> 23:05.882
And you may be right, but you've got to be tact is something that you need to work on a little bit.

23:06.824 --> 23:18.381
And this started out about that time, shortly after he came, and Rudder would call me over to the office when I'd write a letter to him.

23:19.340 --> 23:24.149
He'd have his secretary call me, tell Tex to come over here and I don't talk to him.

23:24.189 --> 23:35.070
So we'd sit across the table and talk for sometimes an hour about things in general and my aspirations and

23:35.050 --> 23:51.965
where I thought we should go and where we weren't going and what I thought maybe some of the reasons were and I think George Christ at the same time did some of this and other people may have also.

23:52.005 --> 23:56.009
And Rudder was an interesting fellow.

23:57.250 --> 24:05.057
You would put an idea in his brain and he didn't act on it immediately.

24:05.037 --> 24:08.501
sometimes six months would go by, sometimes even longer.

24:09.301 --> 24:13.766
And then he would come up with the things you've been talking about.

24:13.846 --> 24:27.860
And Christ once said to me, Tex, you never got any recognition for the things that you and Rudder talked about and Rudder would end up doing.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.623
And I said, George, recognition was not what I was after.

24:30.683 --> 24:33.105
And that really was not.

24:33.185 --> 24:34.707
And one day I told Rudder,

24:36.593 --> 24:39.116
And by this time, I was a full professor.

24:39.356 --> 24:46.044
I believe I got to be a full professor in 62, or 64.

24:46.064 --> 24:51.231
The year you and I got Distinguished Achievement Award.

24:51.251 --> 24:51.351
Yeah.

24:51.992 --> 24:54.775
I almost put mine on, but I still have it back there.

24:56.177 --> 25:04.727
I told Rudder, I have the best job on the campus.

25:06.091 --> 25:09.156
There's not another job I want."

25:09.176 --> 25:15.145
I guess we were talking about why I turned down one or two of these job offers.

25:15.165 --> 25:22.476
Wayne Hall offered me to make me an associate dean of the graduate school.

25:22.837 --> 25:26.783
I said,

25:26.763 --> 25:35.752
I don't like writing my names on documents that way and reading a lot of stuff that is not terribly interesting to me at times.

25:36.774 --> 25:45.703
And so I said to Rudder, I'm a full professor of chemistry, I have the best job on campus.

25:47.565 --> 25:54.272
And Rudder suddenly realized, I guess, this crazy guy isn't bucking for anybody's job.

25:55.045 --> 26:01.902
And so we got to be very, very good friends for one other reason also.

26:01.942 --> 26:08.599
My daughter Linda and his daughter

26:10.233 --> 26:11.354
Getting her name.

26:11.875 --> 26:12.776
Oldest one's Ann.

26:13.576 --> 26:14.798
No, it wasn't Ann.

26:14.838 --> 26:15.678
It was the younger one.

26:15.839 --> 26:17.340
Oh.

26:17.360 --> 26:23.967
In any event, they were in the same grades in A&M Consolidated.

26:23.987 --> 26:26.429
They both went to Texas together.

26:26.469 --> 26:32.395
They roomed together as roommates at Texas for a year or so.

26:32.415 --> 26:37.000
And so Linda would go over to their

26:36.980 --> 26:48.853
home there on the campus fairly frequently, and once in a while I would be invited to come over there and just talk, you know.

26:48.873 --> 26:52.744
So Rudder was the

26:53.028 --> 26:58.401
guy that really got things started, he didn't know how to do it.

27:01.048 --> 27:07.003
You will remember that a professor, full professor in

27:08.671 --> 27:20.346
The College of Veterinary Medicine got fired, and I can't remember that fellow's name, but the net result was we were put on the AAUP blacklist.

27:21.868 --> 27:29.938
And they treated this guy stupidly, very stupidly.

27:29.958 --> 27:37.868
They suddenly said, after promoting him from assistant professor to associate professor to full professor, you're no damn good.

27:38.945 --> 27:39.771
you've got to leave.

27:39.831 --> 27:42.812
And he wouldn't leave so

27:43.231 --> 27:47.156
They changed the locks on some of the doors.

27:47.736 --> 27:52.262
He couldn't get into his office and did a bunch of stuff.

27:52.282 --> 28:01.432
In those many years of sessions with Mr. Rutter, what did you find out were his goals?

28:03.435 --> 28:06.558
His goals were very simple, very straightforward.

28:06.739 --> 28:09.402
He wanted to make A&M the best school in the country.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.225
He didn't know how to do it at times.

28:13.100 --> 28:24.617
and went at it in a pretty rough way, but he was a good Aggie and a most determined individual.

28:24.637 --> 28:30.807
All right, now at first, I know from personal experience, he was very hesitant about co-education.

28:30.867 --> 28:31.828
Absolutely.

28:32.129 --> 28:34.092
Volunteer core, racial integration.

28:34.893 --> 28:40.221
What led him to change on those, do you know?

28:46.310 --> 28:52.178
I'm sure that other people other than myself talked about these things to him.

28:52.418 --> 28:55.983
The Corps used to really drive me crazy.

28:57.445 --> 29:15.388
All the kids when I came here were in the Corps and I would come into a freshman class and a kid would be asleep over there because he'd been kept up all night by some stupid thing that was going on over in the Corps.

29:15.706 --> 29:37.536
Or at the end of each semester, two or three of my best students would come by and say, Professor Isbell, I enjoyed your class very much, but I want to tell you I'm going to transfer to UT or somewhere else next semester.

29:38.257 --> 29:39.739
And I'd say, what's the problem?

29:41.103 --> 29:49.561
They said, almost invariably, the core is simply keeping us from getting the kind of education.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.104
A lot of these were pre-meds.

29:51.685 --> 29:58.099
They were trying their best to get the best grades they could to get in med school or vet school.

29:59.497 --> 30:02.401
And the Corps was absolutely destroying this.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.525
And Rudder and I talked about this.

30:06.106 --> 30:20.745
Didn't talk to him as much about it, the co-ed problem, but you know, there was a year when they declared that any

30:20.894 --> 30:26.439
daughter of a faculty member could go to school in the summertime.

30:28.581 --> 30:36.188
And so my daughter and, well, the other, is it Linda Rudder?

30:36.969 --> 30:37.950
The little Rudder girl.

30:38.330 --> 30:41.473
The two of them decided to take a course.

30:43.535 --> 30:45.557
I've forgotten even what it was.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.821
It was in the liberal arts area.

30:52.720 --> 31:07.557
And I was acting head of the chemistry department at that particular time, and Linda, after the first day of class, she came to me and said, I'm dropping the course.

31:08.077 --> 31:09.559
And I said, what's going on?

31:09.579 --> 31:14.745
And she said, Linda Rudder, the little Rudder girl,

31:15.164 --> 31:26.647
She's dropping two, and this professor, the first class, said, let me make one thing clear.

31:29.032 --> 31:36.868
No woman in my class will ever receive a passing grade in this course.

31:38.047 --> 31:56.140
And I called his department head, I don't remember the fellow, he's a young guy, I don't remember the fellow's name, I called his department head and said, you know, this, I couldn't believe happened, but I have every reason to believe it did happen.

31:57.250 --> 32:00.395
This is not the way to run this university in my opinion.

32:00.435 --> 32:09.568
And so the guy I guess was reprimanded pretty badly and he walked into my office the next day and wanted to fight.

32:09.608 --> 32:12.091
And I said, I'm not interested in fighting you.

32:12.111 --> 32:16.578
You did a stupid thing and you're paying for it.

32:17.759 --> 32:19.562
And if you do it again,

32:20.032 --> 32:22.558
I'll be right on your tail the same way.

32:22.598 --> 32:30.318
So these kind of things kept coming up, and I'm sure Rudder and I talked about these things.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.070
Rudder finally decided that the future of A&M

32:35.050 --> 32:42.561
was the admission of women and a core that was not compulsory.

32:43.503 --> 32:51.875
It was the only way that we could really build a school that had good quality students and whose faculty would stay there.

32:52.877 --> 33:00.889
In your relationship with him, your discussions, did you get the impression of who he listened to most?

33:01.763 --> 33:04.229
Did he have some administrators?

33:04.249 --> 33:06.274
He listened to Wayne Hall a lot.

33:06.294 --> 33:06.655
OK.

33:06.695 --> 33:09.683
That's the name I assumed you were going to mention.

33:09.703 --> 33:09.863
You bet.

33:09.883 --> 33:15.317
Wayne Hall is one of the most reasonable and intelligent

33:16.141 --> 33:23.676
faculty members of those days, and I still keep in touch with Wayne.

33:24.437 --> 33:34.116
Among things I've learned in these interviews is that Wayne Hall is the one who thought up the precise title

33:34.282 --> 33:36.084
that this institution now holds.

33:36.964 --> 33:37.845
Oh, is it really?

33:37.885 --> 33:43.650
See, our recommendation of the Aspirations Committee, I was the secretary of that committee.

33:43.750 --> 33:44.671
Right, right.

33:44.691 --> 33:47.314
And our recommendation was Texas State University.

33:48.094 --> 34:03.428
I was put on a committee by Rudder, and I don't recall who the other members were, but our job was to make recommendations to him for the new name for the university.

34:03.408 --> 34:24.099
And we kicked around everything possible and finally said the only reasonable name, if history has anything to do with it, the land grant schools, many of them are Iowa State, Penn State, things like that.

34:24.840 --> 34:31.390
And therefore, our number one recommendation was Texas State University.

34:31.927 --> 34:42.662
In my conversation with Dean Hall, he said that when that recommendation came, and from the aspirations, he said Mr. Rudder just could not

34:43.486 --> 34:45.889
Except the loss of A&M.

34:46.049 --> 34:53.376
He could not, and plenty of the old farmer students were right in the same boat with Errol Rudder.

34:53.597 --> 35:00.784
So Hall said he came up with the A&M, no period, no spaces, and that Mr. Rudder liked that.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.327
Yeah, that's right.

35:03.347 --> 35:03.908
It lasted.

35:05.449 --> 35:11.856
Do you know of any other key advisors, confidants that Mr. Rudder listened to?

35:14.418 --> 35:20.607
I think he listened to George Christ, just on the general faculty.

35:20.927 --> 35:22.650
What about Benson?

35:22.670 --> 35:27.657
Oh, Fred Benson, in my opinion, was one of the top administrators in those days.

35:28.618 --> 35:33.845
Yeah, Fred Benson ranks very, very high, in my opinion.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.768
I always liked the man.

35:36.963 --> 35:38.546
He's a quality individual.

35:39.207 --> 35:42.052
Yep.

35:43.013 --> 35:49.364
As those changes began to be made in co-education... You know how the whole co-education thing happened?

35:50.266 --> 35:50.646
Go ahead.

35:52.810 --> 36:01.705
Earl called the president of Purdue and said this coming summer

36:03.068 --> 36:09.936
If you could find half a dozen black students up there to send down here, we will accept them.

36:10.377 --> 36:14.022
We won't make any public announcement.

36:14.562 --> 36:15.704
Nothing will happen.

36:15.724 --> 36:18.107
They will just appear, and that will be it.

36:19.128 --> 36:20.029
And that's what happened.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.372
And they were on the campus.

36:22.432 --> 36:27.338
They took courses, and suddenly A&M was integrated.

36:28.060 --> 36:37.390
In your experience as a faculty member, were you ever aware of any racial incident, difficulty, or anything?

36:40.274 --> 36:45.760
I can't think of any, but I'll tell you something that is related to that.

36:46.661 --> 36:57.493
When the women and blacks were first admitted, I think it was the

36:59.279 --> 37:18.897
first year that both women and blacks could come to A&M, we had a very nice young lady who came to, during the summertime I believe it was, and took a graduate organic chemistry course from me.

37:20.219 --> 37:28.206
Very pretty, very nice young lady, and very, very bright.

37:28.962 --> 37:32.586
I have always expected a good deal of my students.

37:32.686 --> 37:49.626
I'm pretty demanding in my courses, and I have always had the philosophy in a chemistry course, it's virtually impossible to make a hundred on an examination.

37:49.646 --> 37:54.852
I don't know whether that was good philosophy or not.

37:55.186 --> 38:01.815
In any event, I gave three or four hour exams that summer.

38:02.616 --> 38:13.190
And after every hour exam, she was the wife of a professor at one of the black colleges in Louisiana.

38:15.133 --> 38:17.896
And a very nice lady.

38:19.318 --> 38:24.265
And she would come into my office after every exam with her exam.

38:26.033 --> 38:31.078
And I graded my exams a little uniquely, I guess.

38:31.978 --> 38:54.319
I would grade all the students' papers on question one, and then I'd go to question two, and I'd give a number on each one of the parts of the exam, and then I'd simply total those.

38:57.134 --> 39:04.481
And I would mark pretty clearly what I was taking off for.

39:06.022 --> 39:25.960
And this lady was making 94s and 95s, and she would come in and try to talk me out of another point or two, and she would say, now look, I didn't maybe answer it exactly like you wanted, but I finally said to her,

39:26.885 --> 39:41.946
I'm not quite sure why you were coming in here after each exam trying to get one or two more points when you're probably making the highest grade in the whole class on each exam.

39:45.030 --> 39:46.432
And you know what her reason was?

39:48.555 --> 39:52.420
She had been told by her husband and maybe others

39:53.092 --> 39:53.873
at her school.

39:54.914 --> 40:00.840
You will not get equal treatment at A&M.

40:00.860 --> 40:14.574
And I said to her, when I grade a paper, I don't know who the person is until I finish the entire grading and start to record the grade.

40:15.975 --> 40:21.440
I will not treat you any differently than I will treat any other student in class.

40:21.701 --> 40:23.082
You get no extra,

40:23.551 --> 40:33.928
but you are sure not going to be docked for any reason except that you don't answer the question that is the way I think it should have been answered.

40:33.968 --> 40:34.950
That's the only reason.

40:36.332 --> 40:37.274
She never came back.

40:39.017 --> 40:40.079
She was a great student.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.264
But don't you think that A&M did

40:43.987 --> 40:51.395
accept and move forward progressively with racial integration.

40:51.635 --> 40:54.378
They did it the best way that I can imagine.

40:55.460 --> 41:02.387
It started out that summer when those Prairie View kids came up here, and basically we had no problems that I encountered.

41:02.407 --> 41:03.268
I never heard of that.

41:03.929 --> 41:13.099
All right, then on the other hand, describe the beginning of coeducation from the point of view of a chemistry faculty member.

41:15.374 --> 41:18.498
How did women, how were they accepted?

41:18.918 --> 41:21.321
In chemistry, no problems whatever.

41:21.762 --> 41:25.506
But they were accepted originally as graduate students.

41:26.768 --> 41:34.937
Were there ever any though, did the male students ever give them any trouble in the early days?

41:36.880 --> 41:39.002
Not to my knowledge.

41:39.573 --> 41:46.841
Was there a pioneering first great female chemistry student?

41:46.861 --> 41:48.944
Was there somebody that kind of was a blazing star?

41:50.105 --> 41:51.186
At the very beginning?

41:51.226 --> 41:59.536
Well, this black student was one, no question about that.

42:00.797 --> 42:07.605
She came when women were first admitted and blacks were first admitted, and she was a quality student.

42:08.463 --> 42:17.705
She worked hard in the course, harder than most of the others, and she made a straight A in the course.

42:18.486 --> 42:25.122
Now I remember one of Joe Vinson's insurance, and I remember one of his daughters

42:25.726 --> 42:32.578
was taking chemistry and other courses over at Sam Houston and driving back and forth.

42:33.440 --> 42:45.000
And she was not a, at first, when women for the undergraduate courses, she was not the child of a,

42:46.060 --> 42:48.222
of a faculty member or staff member.

42:48.242 --> 42:48.522
Right.

42:49.503 --> 43:03.817
And that, so I heard through the grapevine, Joe Vincent threatened to file a lawsuit and that she was allowed to enroll and pretty soon others were allowed to enroll at the undergraduate level.

43:03.857 --> 43:04.297
Do you remember?

43:04.818 --> 43:06.880
I can remember something of that sort.

43:06.940 --> 43:07.740
Yeah, I do.

43:07.881 --> 43:09.922
I knew who Joe Vincent was.

43:10.023 --> 43:13.506
I wasn't a close friend of him, but I knew he was.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.848
Yes, that did happen, I'm sure.

43:16.638 --> 43:28.129
On the general question of coeducation and all those other changes, what was the response in general of the faculty members that you knew to those changes?

43:29.130 --> 43:29.551
Varied.

43:35.056 --> 43:41.662
There were some old Aggie profs that didn't think women should be in A&M.

43:42.263 --> 43:43.724
And they made no bones about it.

43:44.345 --> 43:46.307
They did it in a kind of a subtle way.

43:47.384 --> 43:57.055
but there were some, not very many in chemistry, but there were sure two or three of them, yes.

43:58.537 --> 44:07.247
Who was in those late 50s and then the 60s, who was the key chemistry departmental student advisor?

44:09.650 --> 44:10.611
Or was there someone?

44:10.932 --> 44:12.033
Late 50s?

44:13.675 --> 44:15.417
I'm thinking of John Beckham.

44:15.650 --> 44:20.577
Well, John Beckham was the invaluable person in the chemistry department.

44:20.697 --> 44:22.260
Describe him and his role.

44:24.964 --> 44:33.296
John did everything in the chemistry department that needed doing if nobody else was doing it, and he did it better than anybody else.

44:33.917 --> 44:42.349
When I was asked to be acting head of the chemistry department, I begged out of it.

44:43.392 --> 44:49.875
I guess Dean Hubert came to my office and said,

44:51.391 --> 44:53.274
Paul Callaway had gotten ill.

44:54.115 --> 44:57.139
He was the head of the chemistry department.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.143
He had diabetes and he wouldn't go to a doctor.

45:00.624 --> 45:06.992
Now Paul Callaway was my personal friend and I was the reason that Paul Callaway was brought here.

45:08.795 --> 45:12.079
I knew him before he came here.

45:13.381 --> 45:20.571
And he and I had the same graduate professor at the University of Texas.

45:22.238 --> 45:32.715
Paul was a very quiet, modest sort of fellow who had the ability to get a lot of things done without anybody really realizing what was happening.

45:35.860 --> 45:43.572
But he had John Beckham sitting right out of his office door, and John was an invaluable.

45:43.940 --> 45:44.741
person.

45:44.841 --> 45:52.809
He knew all the things that you have to do on the A&M campus to get a whatever it was done.
