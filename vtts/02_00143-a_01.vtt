WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:22.727
This

00:02.157 --> 00:22.727
is January 14, and we're in College Station at 310 
Suffolk, and I'm talking with Charles E. Chuck

00:02.157 --> 00:22.727
McCandless, whom I think grew up in Dallas. Chuck, 
would you give a biographical summary as you

00:22.827 --> 00:29.717
recall it until you got here to be a member of this 
faculty and staff? Sure. I was born in Dallas,

00:35.193 --> 00:39.198
Texas, July 26, 1931. We're in Trinity Heights, 
which is part of Oak Cliff. Moved to East Dallas in

00:43.984 --> 00:45.946
fifth grade. Then moved to North Dallas to Alex W. 
Stevens Junior High School. Then North Dallas

00:54.276 --> 00:55.557
High School. Graduated from North Dallas. Then I 
went my freshman year at Abilene Christian

00:58.587 --> 01:01.450
College. Found that we didn't exactly match up too 
well. So I transferred to North Texas State

01:05.894 --> 01:08.077
University. Went there for a year and a half. And 
then the Korean police action broke out. And I

01:14.463 --> 01:17.426
volunteered to join the Air Force. Served in the 
Air Force for two years, 10 months, and 18 days. Got

01:23.532 --> 01:27.396
out, and by that time had been married. I had one 
child when I got out, and my wife was pregnant with

01:27.781 --> 01:32.268
our second child. She was born in February. In June 
of 1954, I started at A&M as a physical education

01:36.454 --> 01:42.883
major. Graduated in 56. Became the junior high 
school football and basketball coach at

01:47.610 --> 01:52.978
Sillsbury, Texas. After two years I became the 
counselor and then I left Silsby to go to North

01:53.549 --> 02:05.531
Texas State University to pursue my doctorate in 
counseling. And in between time I got my master's

02:05.551 --> 02:11.261
in counseling from A&M in 1958.

02:14.688 --> 02:17.633
While I was at North Texas I got a phone call from 
Carl Landis, and he asked me about an interest in

02:18.372 --> 02:25.362
coming back to A&M as director of intramurals. I 
told him at the time that I really felt I needed to

02:26.985 --> 02:38.422
complete my doctoral work, and so he invited me 
down for a visit.

02:39.403 --> 02:44.751
I visited with Dr. Landis, Carl Tischler, Frank 
Hubert, They made an offer, which I thought was not

02:46.199 --> 02:50.284
adequate. I said no, and thanked them very much for 
the opportunity.

02:55.892 --> 03:01.059
And got a call back, and they made a better offer. 
And I said, I still felt I needed to come back and

03:01.479 --> 03:04.944
finish my degree. And they said, well, what would 
it take? And I gave them what I thought was an

03:07.367 --> 03:11.312
exorbitant amount And they said yes, and so they 
took my crutches away from me, and I came back and

03:12.980 --> 03:23.534
found out my exhorter mount was really very, very 
small. So that's how I got back to A&E. You got here

03:26.378 --> 03:27.079
when? In August of 1961. Describe

03:30.984 --> 03:39.735
the campus as it was. Much smaller than it is now. I 
think one of the major things about coming back was

03:42.055 --> 03:48.762
something I realized later. In 1961, we still had 
no air conditioning with Texas A&M. But it seemed

03:53.126 --> 03:55.649
to me we had about 7,000 students. At that point, 
the core was optional, all-male,

03:56.610 --> 04:10.965
very large and attractive campus for the size 
student body we had. Something not directed right

04:12.683 --> 04:19.172
at the university, but there was a clear 
difference between Bryan and College Station.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.216
Remember the sign that said, strong men say no to 
strong drink.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.907
So anyway, we'd always thought that College 
Station would be a great place to rear a family. And

04:29.927 --> 04:34.953
that was probably the driving reason that we came 
back. You mentioned Carl Landis. Tell about him.

04:40.156 --> 04:43.720
what kind of person he was, and what kind of 
department he was in. Okay, I'd like to, let me go

04:44.421 --> 04:47.684
back and tell one story, which I enjoy at least. 
After I got out of the Air Force, I thought, I know

04:48.545 --> 04:58.696
I'm going to come back to school, and I had pretty 
well decided to be Texas, A&M, or North Texas. I

04:58.716 --> 05:01.339
knew about North Texas.

05:02.701 --> 05:09.488
Went to the University of Texas, and the people I 
met over there were very much like the reputation

05:02.701 --> 05:09.488
here by the University of Texas. not tremendously 
friendly, and having been an enlisted man in the

05:10.700 --> 05:16.405
Air Force, I wanted to be loved and appreciated. 
And I came to A&M, and the people I met at A&M were Mr.

05:17.806 --> 05:29.016
Penberthy, Spike White, Barney Welch, Pete 
Hardesty, Carl Landis. And there was no decision.

05:32.879 --> 05:34.141
A&M was the place for me to be. I always wondered, 
though, if I'd gone into the fiscal office I don't

05:41.497 --> 05:45.001
think I would have been an athlete. So it's 
interesting how the sequence of events comes out

05:45.061 --> 05:51.328
that influence your life forever and ever. But 
Carl Landis was one of three professors who I think

05:51.348 --> 05:58.155
made a real difference in my life. As an 
undergraduate, I was very impressed with his

05:58.175 --> 06:03.321
professionalism. He just exuded 
professionalism and tried to inculcate that in

06:04.162 --> 06:09.968
all of his students. He

06:11.500 --> 06:20.574
really was the one who seemed to me to be most 
involved with the students in the physical

06:11.500 --> 06:20.574
education department. Only Carl Tishler was the 
head. And Carl Landis was a man who was very proud in

06:24.320 --> 06:28.547
almost every way. He was very concerned about his 
physical appearance. He was very concerned about

06:33.089 --> 06:36.935
his professional appearance. And the physical 
facilities were tremendously important. And I

06:40.361 --> 06:52.840
remember him saying, if you ever walked into a gym 
and saw a sagging volleyball net or a raggedy

06:40.361 --> 06:52.840
basketball net, then you knew you didn't have a 
very good program that you were looking at. So

06:52.860 --> 06:58.028
anyway, his emphasis on professionalism did a lot 
to make me feel that I should aspire to the same

06:58.615 --> 07:04.305
level. He was a fairly well-known football 
official. Very well known. Can you talk about that

07:08.833 --> 07:11.457
a little? Yeah, he again took great pride in it. He 
was a man who knew his rules and he was very precise

07:14.703 --> 07:22.176
and his calls had the same level of and his 
officiating, and something that's distantly

07:23.590 --> 07:28.876
related. I remember one summer we were in class in 
G. Raleigh White, and Carl was somewhat prudish.

07:42.272 --> 07:50.121
And in the classroom behind us was C. K. Est, 
another football official who was not prudish.

07:50.894 --> 07:52.997
And sometimes C.K. would let out expletives that 
would waft into our room, and you could see the red

07:53.017 --> 08:06.979
on Carl Landon's neck starting just above his very 
white starch collar and going up to his silver

07:53.017 --> 08:06.979
hair. I remember one time asking Carl, what was the 
secret of good officiating? He said, call them

08:13.666 --> 08:16.932
fast and walk away tough. That's right. That's 
really good advice. Did he have any

08:21.159 --> 08:27.209
guidelines, any rules? You were mentioning the 
neatness and tidiness. Were there any other...

08:32.710 --> 08:54.491
Oh, as physical education majors, when we did our 
student teaching, we had to wear white pants,

08:32.710 --> 08:54.491
contradiction in terms, but kind of like white 
khakis, the canvas type pants, and the white

08:32.710 --> 08:54.491
t-shirt with physical education emblazoned 
across the chest. And you wore that every day for

08:54.511 --> 09:01.418
your practice teaching, and it better be clean and 
pressed. You did the end of your undergraduate

09:01.702 --> 09:10.615
degree here, and then your Ph.D. My master's here. 
Your master's, okay. Then your Ph.D. at North

09:12.237 --> 09:13.579
Texas. At North Texas. So you came as intramural 
director. Correct. Describe intramural, or

09:18.486 --> 09:21.890
intramural program at that time. It was a large 
program for a school this size. There were 55 units

09:26.156 --> 09:31.624
on campus.

09:32.684 --> 09:33.987
mostly in the military. In most cases, we had 110 
teams because the freshmen competed separately

09:34.588 --> 09:42.283
from the sophomores and above. And with the Corps, 
there was not any doubt if a team would be fielded in

09:43.004 --> 09:52.583
every sport because there would be.

09:53.913 --> 09:58.981
One of the real strengths, I think, of the program 
at that time was they depended on student

09:53.913 --> 09:58.981
managers. And there were a fairly large number of 
sophomore managers. Rather, acceptance dropped

10:05.833 --> 10:11.242
to the junior managers. And then you usually had 
about four to six senior managers. And they really

10:16.891 --> 10:18.233
ran the program. Were they, in effect, the 
coaches? They were the officials. They were the

10:23.194 --> 10:25.757
ones who took all the equipment out to the field. 
They did almost all of it. The sophomores got a

10:29.081 --> 10:34.887
maroon sweater with the intramural seal on it. The 
juniors got a white one. And the seniors got a

10:36.869 --> 10:38.792
watch. I calculated the time. For the seniors, 
they got about a nickel an hour for what they did.

10:47.255 --> 10:54.706
And one of the things I thought was really 
interesting was that there were more engineering

10:47.255 --> 10:54.706
students who served as intramural managers than 
any other college. And here is one of the most

10:55.427 --> 11:05.802
demanding time requirements and in the core, and 
yet they became the leaders in intramurals. How

11:05.822 --> 11:08.405
many sports?

11:10.348 --> 11:12.892
Probably about 32 different sports. Yeah. What 
were the, by today's standards, what were some of

11:14.288 --> 11:18.635
the perhaps unusual? Horseshoes. That was the 
most unusual, I think. Everyone ran

11:22.501 --> 11:33.658
cross-country, which I thought was really 
demanding because most of them had not trained

11:22.501 --> 11:33.658
very far, very long for it, and they'd go out and 
almost all of them finished. And that was before

11:34.099 --> 11:38.946
running was as much of a craze as it is today. Were 
there, by today's standards, some omissions? Was

11:43.285 --> 11:45.087
soccer included? We did not have soccer. But 
volleyball, it was a really comprehensive

11:48.051 --> 11:51.955
program. Badminton, swimming, diving. Art 
Adamson would go over and really, in essence, run

11:55.860 --> 12:02.008
the swimming and diving. He, too, ran a tight ship. 
And those contests occurred normally where? on

12:07.242 --> 12:18.638
what we now call the Duncan Drill Field, on 
occasion on the main drill field, but we didn't

12:07.242 --> 12:18.638
have access to that very often. But we had 
different areas around the campus. Some of them I

12:24.886 --> 12:27.930
shuttered in and shuttered out. On the softball 
fields, they had concrete bases and never wore

12:29.292 --> 12:35.140
out. And no one ever stole one down there. But 
thought of all the dangers that could have been

12:38.062 --> 12:41.846
associated with those. The tennis courts were 
over not very far from the Grove. We used the Grove

12:53.396 --> 12:56.098
for some of the events. DeWare was where 
Intramurals was located when I came back.

13:05.832 --> 13:08.737
So it was a program I think anyone would ever be very 
proud of. Mr. Penberthy was the founder of the

13:08.797 --> 13:13.044
entrepreneurial program. And then Spike White 
and then Bonnie Welch. And that's a pretty elite

13:15.828 --> 13:21.077
group of people. You say he founded it, was it 
during the 30s, 20s? I think the 20s. I think about

13:26.385 --> 13:30.091
27, if I remember correctly. And Mr. Penberthy was 
still around. Describe him. Oh, Mr. Penberthy was

13:32.663 --> 13:36.669
a wonderful, wonderful person.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.116
One of his great attributes was remembering 
everyone's name. And even when he went back into

13:43.098 --> 13:55.255
physical education, after he'd been one of the 
upper level administrators, he came back and

13:43.098 --> 13:55.255
volleyball was a sport that he really took over. 
And volleyball had just gotten a lot of

13:55.275 --> 14:00.342
recognition by television of the Olympics. And 
Mr. Penberthy was nearing the end of his

14:01.013 --> 14:08.005
professional career, but he learned a great deal 
about volleyball. Went out to watch a good

14:08.025 --> 14:17.300
volleyball team play, and came back and taught 
good volleyball in the physical education

14:08.025 --> 14:17.300
program at A&M. At that time, almost everyone was 
in the Corps, and everyone wore a white t-shirt,

14:17.320 --> 14:26.616
maroon shorts, and Mr. Penberthy had about 48 
students in class. By the third class, we were

14:29.401 --> 14:32.404
keeping every student's name. When you see all 
18-year-old males with the military haircut and

14:32.424 --> 14:45.458
white t-shirts and running short, there's not a 
lot to distinguish those people from each other.

14:45.578 --> 14:49.642
Alright, so you do intramurals for how long? Until 
63, a relatively short period of time. And then?

14:52.845 --> 14:55.388
Then I went to education in psychology. And at that 
time, it was a combined department. And I taught

15:00.005 --> 15:04.329
psychology and educational psychology. In a 
short period of time, I became the director of the

15:04.349 --> 15:19.543
freshman courses, which were courses that had 
been taught in the basic division, study skills,

15:04.349 --> 15:19.543
job orientation, and some things like that. And 
who was the head of the education? Paul Eastman,

15:23.166 --> 15:24.868
the scrum head. Paul Henseling was a former school 
superintendent. Again, I'd say that he was one of

15:28.484 --> 15:32.908
them. He represented the profession very well. He 
thought education was a tremendously important

15:35.351 --> 15:43.618
area of the university and represented it well. 
And education is one of those disciplines that I

15:43.638 --> 15:51.666
think is always suspect in the school, such as A&M. 
One of the things that I learned while I was here was

15:52.625 --> 16:02.517
that even when A&M was very small, it was the number 
two University in producing male teachers in the

16:03.155 --> 16:09.462
state of Texas, which I think very few people ever 
recognized. But with the vocational agriculture

16:10.443 --> 16:20.633
and vocational education and health and physical 
education in particular, the Aggie produced a lot

16:10.443 --> 16:20.633
of high school teachers. Now the department was 
the Department on? Education and Psychology. And

16:26.339 --> 16:29.803
it remained a department only until

16:33.462 --> 16:35.004
I think it was 1973. You can probably help me on 
that. That's right. Somewhere in there. And

16:39.291 --> 16:44.579
the department was housed where? In the academic 
building. Fourth floor of the academic building.

16:50.408 --> 16:58.521
And the department during those years was about 
how many and number of faculty? I just have to make a

16:58.621 --> 17:00.364
guess.

17:03.044 --> 17:03.985
probably 20.

17:07.991 --> 17:25.895
And then when they divided the department, 
education and psychology, and then they divided

17:07.991 --> 17:25.895
the college, just prior to that, they'd separate 
the College of Business Administration out of the

17:07.991 --> 17:25.895
College of Liberal Arts. And then for a short 
period of time,

17:35.377 --> 17:42.486
Dean Hubert served as dean of liberal arts and the 
head of education and psychology. And I think

17:42.506 --> 17:43.467
you've heard this story. I still think it's a good 
story. I was the associate dean. And one day, I was

17:48.493 --> 17:55.201
in Dean Hubert's office in the academic building. 
And he was determined that he would do no business

17:55.381 --> 18:04.793
for education and psychology in the dean's office 
on the first floor of that building and no liberal

18:05.195 --> 18:09.780
arts business in the department's office in the 
fourth floor. But one day I was in his office and we

18:11.341 --> 18:17.467
were visiting and he was shuffling through papers 
around the desk. And I saw him get something to

18:17.487 --> 18:28.919
Frank W.R. Hubert, dean of the College of Liberal 
Arts from Frank W.R. Hubert, interim head of

18:17.487 --> 18:28.919
education and psychology. And he wrote very large 
letters, denied. and said, Chuck, those damn

18:33.663 --> 18:38.228
department heads will ask for anything. And I 
thought that was, I thought that was Franky. As

18:41.112 --> 18:44.235
department head, he felt obliged to ask for it. And 
as dean, he determined that it wasn't wanted. So,

18:49.902 --> 18:58.692
as you joined the faculty, the teaching faculty, 
non-compulsory core, co-education, racial

18:59.178 --> 19:04.763
integration, all of those changes are getting 
started right about then. How did that affect

19:05.004 --> 19:07.746
education? It affected it in a lot of ways. And 
incidentally, one of the things that I have

19:11.390 --> 19:20.538
believed for a long while, when they talk about 
integration in Indiana, they're talking about

19:11.390 --> 19:20.538
women. I honestly cannot remember any difficulty 
in accepting blacks. but there was a great deal of

19:27.882 --> 19:31.445
emotion in accepting women. All right. Now, on 
that topic, share any that you can recall. Well,

19:35.969 --> 19:45.177
one of the things that, again, one of the things 
that I enjoyed, in physical education, they were

19:35.969 --> 19:45.177
talking about how are we going to accommodate 
these women. And so they were trying to make

19:45.197 --> 19:55.847
decisions about locker rooms and where there 
would be modifications and how would we do all this

19:45.197 --> 19:55.847
and how would we do all that and what activities 
would be available for women. and the hiring of

19:56.266 --> 20:01.694
women faculty members and all those things. And so 
someone asked Art Adamson, how are you going to

20:01.714 --> 20:07.141
take care of them? And Art's response was, hell, 
that ain't no problem. I'll give them a cap, a

20:10.246 --> 20:16.114
strap, and two band-aids.

20:16.887 --> 20:20.994
Did the enrollment numbers change? Didn't change 
dramatically at first because, as I'm sure you

20:21.916 --> 20:37.765
know, the first change was the change in the name 
and the change in women's

20:21.916 --> 20:37.765
being eligible to come to A&M. was for faculty 
family, student wives, and women seeking an

20:38.183 --> 20:52.983
advanced degree and not readily available at 
other Texas institutions, which meant the vet

20:38.183 --> 20:52.983
school.

20:53.644 --> 21:00.573
There were no real changes in the facilities at 
that time, that I remember. And then I think three

21:00.773 --> 21:05.700
years later, they opened it up to all women. And the 
real change was when they built

21:08.525 --> 21:15.304
Kruger-Dunn-Bosier-Aston complex, and we 
started officially housing them on campus. And

21:15.324 --> 21:16.888
that made a world of difference. Did that make a 
difference in the education world? Oh,

21:20.639 --> 21:22.063
dramatically. Dramatically. It wasn't very long 
until there were more female majors than there

21:24.843 --> 21:31.292
were male majors. Let's go back to education and so 
forth. Frank Hubert was Dean of Arts and Sciences.

21:39.845 --> 21:41.828
That's correct. Describe your view of him when you 
were a junior faculty member.

21:51.221 --> 21:51.762
Frank Hubert I didn't have a lot of association 
with him as a junior faculty member. I really got to

21:58.733 --> 22:00.455
know Frankie well.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.582
I'm going to go back and forth. But when I first met 
him, when I was applying for a job, he was very

22:05.602 --> 22:13.693
business-like. There was not a great deal of 
warmth in our meeting. So he was involved in the

22:17.098 --> 22:19.201
interview process? Yes.

22:23.078 --> 22:30.507
I came across, like I said, very, very serious, 
very matter of fact, very direct.

22:33.631 --> 22:42.862
Then I got to know them a little better and in the 
summers I taught at the adjunct in Junction.

22:42.882 --> 22:46.567
In 61 until 63, I think. The last year I was the 
director of the adjunct. But that summer, I got a

22:52.120 --> 22:52.981
phone call. I had, I had just been offered to become 
Department Head of Educational Psychology, and

22:53.021 --> 23:03.799
that was something I thought I might want to do. Now 
this is about when? About 16, 16,

23:05.021 --> 23:12.133
find out. I can, I can find out. Sure, no, that's all 
right. But anyway, Frank Hubert called me from the

23:19.897 --> 23:27.948
when I was at the adjunct and told me that he'd like 
for me to be the assistant dean of liberal arts. And

23:30.591 --> 23:43.429
so I came back and I visited with him and he was 
telling me about it and I told him that I had just

23:30.591 --> 23:43.429
been offered the job in the department head of ed 
science which was a brand new department. And he

23:43.449 --> 23:48.115
offered the job to me again and I was to commit, and 
the third time I realized he really wasn't asking.

23:53.683 --> 23:58.348
He was telling me that he would like me to be the 
assistant dean. And then something I thought was

23:58.368 --> 24:05.596
really strange was after I'd agreed, he said, now, 
Chuck, I want you to understand that there's no

23:58.368 --> 24:05.596
commitment that's going to continue. He said, 
we're going to have a national search. And I

24:10.180 --> 24:13.764
thought, whoa. What is this? But anyway. I did 
accept the job and very shortly thereafter I was

24:17.238 --> 24:24.491
made the associate dean. And then when they 
divided liberal arts and education, I was given

24:24.511 --> 24:36.993
the choice of going to education or staying with 
liberal arts and for one year I served the

24:24.511 --> 24:36.993
associate dean of both colleges. And then opted to 
stay with liberal arts. So it was an interesting

24:43.124 --> 24:49.751
transition.

24:49.771 --> 25:01.484
And as you asked earlier, the nature of the college 
was just changing very, very rapidly. The offices

25:01.504 --> 25:04.608
that were located then were liberal arts. First 
floor of the academic building. Academic

25:10.614 --> 25:11.275
building. Share some more Hubert anecdotes that 
demonstrate his operational style. OK. One of the

25:17.840 --> 25:40.587
things that I thought was meaningful that I'm not 
sure he thought much about, but when he was

25:17.840 --> 25:40.587
designing the offices

25:17.840 --> 25:40.587
for the dean of arts and sciences, he planned the 
dean's office on the fifth floor of the biology

25:17.840 --> 25:40.587
building. And when they separated science out, 
then he stayed with liberal arts. But I'm not sure

25:51.143 --> 26:00.734
he ever thought about that the fifth floor of the 
biology building is certainly not on the path to

25:51.143 --> 26:00.734
any different. You have to make a special trip to go 
there. The location of the dean's office for

26:06.361 --> 26:12.328
liberal arts, which I'm not sure how that was 
chosen, that was on the first floor of the academic

26:12.747 --> 26:18.295
building, which was on the road to everywhere. And 
so I really thought that was the ideal place for a

26:18.315 --> 26:28.671
dean's office because it was so easy for the 
students to have access to, and the faculty. But

26:30.514 --> 26:34.560
that was not where the dean of science office was 
and is. What about his temperament?

26:41.367 --> 26:43.649
humor, anger, patience. All those. He had all 
those.

26:51.737 --> 26:57.402
He was one of the most astute political readers 
I've ever known. He read things very well.

27:03.547 --> 27:10.834
And I think his basic nature is reserved, 
restrained, introvert, but I've never seen

27:11.776 --> 27:18.925
anyone who could be more effective in smoothing 
people. He could move among groups and know

27:19.405 --> 27:34.664
exactly what to say, say it extremely well, and 
then move to the next group and make everyone feel

27:19.405 --> 27:34.664
that they'd had his undivided attention for that 
period of time. It's a skill that I wish that I had

27:36.146 --> 27:40.872
someone who could even approach, but But that was a 
real strength. He had some health problems, and I

27:44.962 --> 28:04.009
think there were times that his health problems 
created a situation where he did not come across

27:44.962 --> 28:04.009
his back in particular.

28:04.369 --> 28:09.897
I'll rely on your judgment on this, but one of the 
things that I remember

28:11.615 --> 28:14.117
when someone was retiring who had worked in his 
office. And he'd had a little more to drink than he

28:15.959 --> 28:20.944
probably should have before he responded. But he 
started out by saying, you know, when I first went

28:22.726 --> 28:31.794
to work for Frank Hubert, I thought of him like he 
lived as a cold fish. And I looked at Dean Hubert,

28:33.636 --> 28:38.601
and it looked as though someone had hit him with a 
wet towel. He just could not imagine that that's

28:39.273 --> 28:42.998
how anyone would see him. But the man went on 
quickly, seemingly quickly, to say that after he

28:44.019 --> 29:05.568
got to work with Frank Hubert and realized what a 
warm human being he really is, and that was his

28:44.019 --> 29:05.568
message, not the first part, but I'm not sure that 
Dean Hubert ever heard the last part of that.

29:07.631 --> 29:08.352
He was... He was a very decisive person. He had 
strong opinions,

29:12.572 --> 29:27.469
made judgments quickly about people, some of 
which I thought were very astute and some of which I

29:12.572 --> 29:27.469
thought were considerably off-mark. I thought 
the same about my judgment. But were there some key

29:32.634 --> 29:37.680
decisions about liberal arts and or education, 
which you now look back and see those were

29:39.112 --> 29:47.782
important decisions, plus or minus. Well, I think 
that the division of arts and sciences, again, is a

29:47.802 --> 29:55.130
major factor. If you think about A&M today, and you 
think about geology,

29:55.150 --> 30:08.865
and you think about chemistry, physics, all those 
that are in there, business administration, was

30:09.335 --> 30:13.822
under liberal arts at that point. There were 
really a lot of very major transitions that from my

30:14.883 --> 30:21.833
point of view occurred very smoothly. I didn't 
feel any great bumps in the road as we went along,

30:23.296 --> 30:39.139
and I think Frank Hubert deserves a lot of credit 
for not being threatened by that, but believing

30:23.296 --> 30:39.139
that that was the essential in the evolution of a 
real university. Q Do you have any idea how much

30:44.234 --> 30:50.621
role he played in deciding that those divisions 
would come about? A I can't imagine that he didn't

30:52.223 --> 30:55.907
have a major role. Frank Huber, as I said, was a very 
effective administrator. While he was in the

31:00.232 --> 31:03.355
dean's office and all that, I thought he was as 
effective as any administrator that I had known,

31:03.740 --> 31:17.235
and I gave him the political ability to evaluate a 
situation that I thought was absolutely

31:03.740 --> 31:17.235
essential. I don't think that most of those things 
would have happened smoothly, if at all, had he

31:17.455 --> 31:28.027
really resisted them. I think he was 
instrumental. What was his relationship with

31:33.524 --> 31:37.891
Vice President Call and President Rudd? It seemed 
to me that he had a very close relationship with

31:38.152 --> 31:46.385
them. I didn't see him with Wayne Hall very often, 
but I would have liked to have been there and just

31:46.405 --> 32:00.628
watched the glib pattern that went back and forth 
between the two, because they were both very

31:46.405 --> 32:00.628
serious people. one of the stories which I will 
share that I enjoyed.
