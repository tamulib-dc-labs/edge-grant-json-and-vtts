WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:03.826
Okay. He was the first captain, they call it, at 
West Point, which is the parallel to the cadet

00:03.846 --> 00:09.672
colonel at A&M. He was one of the youngest colonels 
promoted in World War II, and very young brigadier

00:10.694 --> 00:19.183
general, all that, very outstanding all the way. 
Commanded the division at a young age, and

00:19.243 --> 00:23.628
commanded a corps. I think that General 
Westmoreland was a fine commander. I think that

00:33.207 --> 00:46.690
few people would have done it much differently or 
any better than he did his job that he was assigned.

00:48.453 --> 00:53.681
The mission he was given, I simply think he was 
given the wrong mission. I think he was not ever

00:53.701 --> 00:58.409
given an objective, a realistic objective. The 
national leadership never defined an objective

01:00.089 --> 01:03.353
to win the Vietnam War. General Westmoreland, 
like a good soldier, accepted his instructions

01:05.835 --> 01:11.121
and carried them out the best he could. I, in 
retrospect, have often thought since what

01:11.141 --> 01:26.198
difference might have been made if he and he must 
have realized that we couldn't win under the rules

01:28.118 --> 01:57.957
he was required to operate under what would have 
been the result if he'd said give me a definitive

01:28.118 --> 01:57.957
objective for winning this war that would win this 
war or give me new orders get me out of here

01:28.118 --> 01:57.957
I think it would have made a difference now I'm not 
saying that I feel he should have done that I don't

01:58.882 --> 02:01.566
know what I would have done under these 
circumstances. Sure. If you're a good soldier and

02:02.908 --> 02:15.065
think you can carry out the instructions that have 
been given you, unless you violently disagree

02:02.908 --> 02:15.065
with those instructions, you do the best you can 
with them. Sure. If you violently disagree and

02:15.987 --> 02:22.777
can't resolve the difference with your directing 
authority, then you resign. You quit. Ask to be

02:25.801 --> 02:27.684
moved. Transfer. Now, you dealt with him on a 
weekly basis. What kind of person was he? Well, he

02:35.112 --> 02:38.135
was a personable man. He was intense in the sense 
that he was always thinking of the mission. He was

02:45.543 --> 02:49.087
always trying to be helpful. He never showed 
discouragement to me or to us. He may have been

02:56.214 --> 02:57.656
discouraged at times. We weren't discouraged. We 
won all our battles, and I think it's safe to say

02:58.889 --> 03:08.441
that the American forces won their major battles. 
There's a lot of talk of the Tet Offensive of 68. I

03:11.445 --> 03:17.272
wasn't there at that time, but the enemy didn't win 
that battle. But of course we lost the war. But

03:20.316 --> 03:26.584
General Westmoreland was, he was basically good 
to work for and And we appreciated seeing him when

03:27.695 --> 03:29.738
he'd come around. He always had something 
cheerful or helpful to say. What did you think of

03:35.066 --> 03:37.069
him when you sat down and thought of him? I think 
that they had great respect for him. Because I

03:42.837 --> 03:47.183
worked with General Westmoreland after he and I 
came back from Vietnam. I was chief of legislative

03:47.203 --> 03:52.651
liaison for the Department of the Army, and I saw a 
great deal more of him then. And I've seen him

03:53.552 --> 03:56.757
several times since he retired. And I commented to 
him, looking back not so much on his time in the

03:58.154 --> 04:23.385
Vietnam War, but his problem in being chief of 
staff of the army when the national resolve was

03:58.154 --> 04:23.385
melting and the problems were mounting in the army 
as a result of the lack of resolve to prosecute that

03:58.154 --> 04:23.385
war.

04:26.318 --> 04:42.299
I felt, and I told him, I thought he'd had the 
toughest job as Chief of Staff of the Army as any

04:26.318 --> 04:42.299
Chief of Staff ever had, with the possible 
exception of the Civil War Chiefs of Staff. You

04:44.382 --> 04:55.296
recall that during that period that he was Chief of 
Staff, for example,

04:44.382 --> 04:55.296
the draft was discontinued, which is evidence of 
the discontent within the population. Well,

04:59.701 --> 05:07.227
that's taking a means away from the Army, a 
resource away from the Army. The Congress, which

05:07.247 --> 05:25.283
at the time when I first became chief legislative 
liaison, I would say that 80% of the members of

05:07.247 --> 05:25.283
Congress in 1968

05:07.247 --> 05:25.283
were resolved to prosecute that Vietnam War. I 
would say that by the end of 1970, they were a

05:26.731 --> 05:33.740
minority. So the whole thing was crumbling. It was 
inevitable we had to just move out. We had to give

05:40.089 --> 05:42.292
up. That's what happened. What about the 
relations with your Vietnamese counterparts?

05:49.922 --> 05:55.489
I'm glad you asked that, because it's occurred to 
me we should weave this in. We worked closely with a

05:55.756 --> 06:02.224
particular division, the 22nd Division. It had 
two commanders, different commanders, while I

06:03.947 --> 06:08.633
was there in that year and a half. We, at times, 
worked with other divisions.

06:13.579 --> 06:24.413
To generalize a little bit here, when we arrived 
there, they were pretty well whipped, to some

06:13.579 --> 06:24.413
degree demoralized. I think

06:26.485 --> 06:31.911
they've had a lot of experience in combat. They've 
been fighting for a long, long time. But they never

06:35.375 --> 06:45.846
really lost

06:35.375 --> 06:45.846
their defensive mentality. We did work side by 
side in a number of operations, and we did

06:47.808 --> 06:55.176
encourage them to do more of the operations, 
offensive operations, we never, at least the ones

06:55.527 --> 07:06.103
I saw, never got the Vietnamese units in an 
offensive frame of mind. I don't know how this

07:08.126 --> 07:19.763
should have been balanced out or how it could have 
been balanced out, but as a result, initially the

07:08.126 --> 07:19.763
year and a half I was there, and the front year and a 
half of this after the buildup,

07:23.810 --> 07:30.296
We just took it upon ourselves to defeat the enemy. 
And we did not push these Vietnamese enough into

07:31.517 --> 07:40.024
the offensive operations. I think their greatest 
weakness was one that we never really came to

07:41.766 --> 07:48.432
correct. Their greatest weakness was their 
ability to sustain themselves in the field. In

07:53.324 --> 07:59.410
other words, a logistics, lack of logistical 
know-how and capabilities. And of course, that is

08:00.732 --> 08:02.093
very essential. Sure. Arvin didn't have that 
ability. They just didn't have that ability. And

08:05.596 --> 08:06.838
it was never developed. Now, why or how it could 
have been done better, I don't know. While you're

08:11.703 --> 08:20.952
there

08:11.703 --> 08:20.952
basically to conduct combat operations, how can 
you there at the same time retrain these divisions

08:21.252 --> 08:26.617
of the Vietnamese effectively. Perhaps there's 
been a lot of criticism that we didn't give them a

08:26.838 --> 08:30.141
greater role. Well, to give them the greater role, 
you'd have to prepare them for a greater role. That

08:34.085 --> 08:35.687
was never really accomplished. And I suppose a 
part of that was

08:35.707 --> 08:48.880
overall resources and capability to support 
logistically. because we were strained in

08:49.889 --> 08:56.258
supplying that operation over there 
logistically from our shores here. So, you know,

08:58.021 --> 09:04.049
if you put more over to the Vietnamese, are the 
American troops going to get enough? You see what I

09:04.069 --> 09:04.790
mean? Sure. Well, when you went out on a maneuver, 
let's say you were going to attack a position,

09:06.152 --> 09:13.563
would you take the urban troops with you or would 
you just do it on your own? Well, we would do it on our

09:14.224 --> 09:15.846
own. combined with them in an operation, it would 
be they'd have their area of operation and we would

09:16.062 --> 09:21.168
have ours. And then your air mobile would take care 
of both? We would often support them with airlift

09:26.013 --> 09:33.201
jets, with aircraft. Or they'd have a mission that 
was compatible with their capabilities, you see.

09:38.507 --> 09:43.673
And I must add that they fought some very 
effective, some good battles I don't remember the

09:45.914 --> 10:00.513
figures, but I recall two or three real successful 
fights that that particular division had, but it

09:45.914 --> 10:00.513
wasn't often they really got engaged like that. 
For the most part, they'd sort of sit back at the

10:01.394 --> 10:03.677
base? They tended to protect their territory and 
not gather up a concentration of force to go and

10:04.238 --> 10:15.853
conduct an offensive operation of any duration. 
How about the officers? How'd you get along with

10:18.566 --> 10:20.148
the Airmen officers? Oh, we got along well with 
them, and some of them were extremely capable

10:20.168 --> 10:25.194
officers. After all, remember the experience 
they've had now, and that they had had. For

10:32.604 --> 10:46.583
example, the second division commander that I 
knew in this particular division was a very young

10:32.604 --> 10:46.583
man and very bright and had a very positive command 
presence. Seemed to be very much respected by his

10:47.238 --> 10:53.888
troops, and a capable leader, and a good 
tactician. Of course, a number of them were

10:55.370 --> 11:03.042
trained in our schools, and a lot of them were 
trained in the school experience. But again, they

11:03.062 --> 11:05.446
were largely defending themselves. That's my 
picture of it. Of course, a lot of people have

11:08.570 --> 11:13.718
complained about the corruption in Vietnam.

11:16.685 --> 11:20.330
Did you find any of this, any experience with that 
whatsoever? I had no direct knowledge of that.

11:24.675 --> 11:25.717
I've heard the same thing. I've heard them over 
there. I

11:27.679 --> 11:38.794
would like to know what the direct evidence might 
be, but I think it's safe to say that

11:44.579 --> 12:02.537
It has been the long, long, it's been the custom and 
tradition in the oriental societies that persons

11:44.579 --> 12:02.537
in authority

11:44.579 --> 12:02.537
are going, it's almost, if I understand it 
correctly, it's almost an accepted practice that

11:44.579 --> 12:02.537
everyone in authority is a percentage man. I've 
heard it said, and I can't prove this, that if an

12:04.279 --> 12:11.987
individual becomes comes in a position of 
authority in an oriental society, and he has a

12:13.604 --> 12:25.320
friend who wants a job and he gets him a job, that 
friend expects that he should be rewarded. And so

12:26.601 --> 12:27.563
he rewards him.

12:30.507 --> 12:42.683
If you're in the army and you procure from a source,

12:30.507 --> 12:42.683
something like supplies, let's say, If I 
understand the tradition correctly, and I never

12:43.810 --> 12:59.090
saw this, I've never seen it written, then it's 
sort of common that there is a consideration

12:43.810 --> 12:59.090
because, you know, I came to you. I don't know. 
Because you didn't see it. I didn't see it. I don't

13:05.638 --> 13:06.059
know. I've heard these things. But what I'm saying 
is it's more a part of the system than it is...

13:13.612 --> 13:15.834
identifying with a corrupt Vietnamese army. It's 
more a part of the culture. Okay, would you compare

13:19.798 --> 13:29.607
the quality of the North Vietnamese Army with the 
American Army, just the soldiers? Well, the North

13:29.627 --> 13:33.891
Vietnamese soldier individually is a very good 
soldier. In fact, his small units, I'm talking

13:33.911 --> 13:40.497
about squads and platoons, fought very well. I 
don't believe they ever defeated a company-sized

13:41.067 --> 13:45.634
unit of ours or greater. So you've got to say they 
don't compare at the higher level. And I don't want

13:50.862 --> 13:59.996
to take any of the credit from that individual 
Vietnamese soldier, because he usually operated

13:50.862 --> 13:59.996
with pretty sparse supplies. And he wasn't too 
well equipped. He had a good rifle, the infantry

14:06.406 --> 14:10.011
soldier did. and they were well disciplined. I 
don't want to take away from that either, but they

14:13.831 --> 14:25.884
have a form of discipline that, of course, we have, 
I think, acceptable discipline, but I refer to

14:13.831 --> 14:25.884
theirs as the pistol discipline. But you have to 
kind of respect any system that will maintain a

14:25.904 --> 14:34.933
discipline in those conditions. Well, the pistol 
discipline is, as far as I know, an officer in

14:41.058 --> 14:47.027
charge has got the authority of his pistol if he 
needs that. That's what I was referring to. Okay.

14:53.316 --> 14:57.823
You said that most of your combat was with the North 
Vietnamese Army. What about the Viet Cong, the

14:58.985 --> 15:05.034
indigenous South Vietnamese who were 
communist-bound? The Viet Cong, we did have

15:05.054 --> 15:10.542
contact with them on a number of occasions because 
they had a very well-known regiment that was

15:11.332 --> 15:27.889
operating in the area that we were in, and of 
course, it's hard to visualize the vastness of

15:11.332 --> 15:27.889
this area and the fire station, and so when you 
wonder how A regiment can survive all the attacks

15:29.692 --> 15:46.997
that we made upon them, but part of their mission 
was survival, of course, because they wanted to

15:29.692 --> 15:46.997
choose the moment and type of operation they might 
conduct to hurt us, disrupt us, keep the system

15:29.692 --> 15:46.997
disrupted. But they seemed to be good soldiers. 
Again, they were very effective in avoiding

15:49.221 --> 15:59.175
destruction, although I think we had them and... 
The two Vietnamese divisions in our area, North

15:59.780 --> 16:10.551
Vietnamese division, we had them at times, 
according to the intelligence we got, in very,

15:59.780 --> 16:10.551
very poor strength. They lost a lot of people, but 
they always got replaced.

16:18.379 --> 16:22.823
Was there a lot of hatred between the American 
soldier and the Vietnamese? I mean, were there?

16:24.024 --> 16:24.885
Which Vietnamese? The North or the South? I mean, 
the North Vietnamese. The North Vietnamese? Oh, I

16:28.048 --> 16:28.909
think so. I think it's naturally a hatred of the 
enemy. Was it as bad as between the Americans and

16:32.162 --> 16:34.885
the Japanese? I don't believe so. I don't believe 
it was. Because, well, I just don't think it was.

16:40.870 --> 16:51.940
The Japanese, you know, started out their war to

16:40.870 --> 16:51.940
not take prisoners and not to be taken in. Well, 
what about the idea of Americans not being taken

16:51.960 --> 16:58.947
prisoner by the North Vietnamese or the Viet Cong? 
We had quite a number taken. I say we, the armed

17:03.181 --> 17:08.225
American forces, compared to the war against the 
Japanese. Now in our division, I think we could

17:08.866 --> 17:18.235
count them probably on one or two hands that we lost 
the prisoner status.

17:21.318 --> 17:24.661
And it usually was a case of being overrun, small 
unit. Did they ever return? I never knew of them. I

17:29.774 --> 17:32.658
never knew of the recovery or return. I would say we 
could count on one hand. I remember one incident

17:35.321 --> 17:39.887
where we lost two men. It's when a position was 
overrun at night. And there were two or three

17:46.054 --> 17:54.565
isolated incidents of where we thought they were 
taken prisoner. It's awfully hard to tell once you

17:54.585 --> 17:58.009
lose a man whether he was taken prisoner or just 
taken off and killed or, you know, what. Whether he

18:02.584 --> 18:05.327
survived prisoner status is what I'm saying. 
Sure, absolutely. What about the Viet Cong were

18:07.531 --> 18:16.383
well known in South Vietnam for the amount of 
terrorism against government officials in the

18:07.531 --> 18:16.383
small villages and cities. Did you ever witness 
any of the terrorism in Vietnam? I never actually

18:19.347 --> 18:22.672
witnessed it, but I've been close to it. The Viet 
Cong used a lot of their, this regiment I mentioned

18:22.772 --> 18:28.300
and its battalions, used a lot of their time. 
That's why they wanted to survive, because that

18:31.625 --> 18:34.209
was their main function. They'd go into villages 
and terrorize them at night, and the purpose was

18:36.452 --> 18:49.330
not only the retribution against the leaders, but 
to keep the people uncertain about our side. They

18:50.652 --> 18:57.982
established

18:50.652 --> 18:57.982
the example, well, those guys can't protect you, 
really. Right.

19:01.068 --> 19:17.932
One of the things about the American military was 
one of the criticisms made even by some of the

19:01.068 --> 19:17.932
American military themselves was that there was a 
lot of careerism among the officer corps in

19:01.068 --> 19:17.932
Vietnam. Would you address that?

19:23.039 --> 19:28.527
That is probably a justified criticism because I 
personally never favored that. But it's

19:33.964 --> 19:39.535
criticism against the policy, not necessarily 
the individual. It was the basic policy, of

19:39.555 --> 19:49.274
course, that we'd rotate each after a year of 
service in Vietnam, officers and enlisted men.

19:49.294 --> 19:50.937
Now there were exceptions. Volunteer to stay and 
others were told to stay, like I was asked to stay.

19:56.428 --> 20:00.393
And under those circumstances you volunteer.

20:03.116 --> 20:15.932
And it was generally the practice that officers in 
command, colonels and below, would be six months,

20:03.116 --> 20:15.932
approximately six months in command. And to me, 
that was a mistake. It made some sense to rotate the

20:21.494 --> 20:38.838
captains commanding companies that frequently 
considering they're going to be there one year

20:21.494 --> 20:38.838
because of the greater exposure and the greater 
stress on captains at company level. I'm talking

20:39.739 --> 20:42.603
about infantry captains and cavalry captains. 
But it just didn't make any sense at all to me. I

20:46.949 --> 20:50.033
didn't think it was fair to the units of the men to 
have a a commander move in every six months and

20:50.688 --> 20:55.754
start over. I thought they should be there their 
full year. And

20:59.840 --> 21:14.238
there's a lot to be said for leaving the captains 
too because really if the troopers are going to be

20:59.840 --> 21:14.238
there a year, the captain ought to be there a year on 
that basis.

21:17.141 --> 21:18.383
There's a lot to be said for leaving them all there 
for a year. Okay. That was a practice, but I never

21:23.847 --> 21:30.695
agreed with the six-month rotation for in 
command. Another, of course, of the big issues was

21:30.715 --> 21:40.005
how the press, the dealings between the military 
and the press, and many a charge that the press

21:30.715 --> 21:40.005
spectacularized the war. Did you have any 
relations or dealings with the press? I sure did.

21:43.650 --> 21:49.416
In fact, this disturbed me a great deal. And I guess 
we naturally make the comparisons with the press

21:49.717 --> 22:02.915
coverage in World War II, where, first of all, 
there was censorship. And there's a lot to be said

22:02.935 --> 22:05.559
to justify censorship. And I think if we ever get 
into- World War II. And World War II. And if we ever

22:09.564 --> 22:14.511
get into another conflict, I think we ought to very 
seriously consider putting it on. Because you can

22:14.631 --> 22:17.395
just look at the Vietnam War, perspective of time 
and focus on the press coverage and you can see the

22:18.252 --> 22:47.263
influence the comfort to the enemy the influence 
for the toward deterioration of troop morale and

22:18.252 --> 22:47.263
citizen support for that war but anyway that's 
true about sensationalizing and another feature

22:18.252 --> 22:47.263
of World War II you'd expect to have a 
correspondent with you and he'd stay with you for

22:18.252 --> 22:47.263
months and months and months the division I'm 
talking about. And he became known to the men and he

22:51.064 --> 22:59.412
knew them and he would understand what that 
division was doing and accomplishing and so

22:51.064 --> 22:59.412
forth. It was quite different in Vietnam. We had 
one man that stayed with us

23:00.853 --> 23:08.860
over six months. And he was representing some 
little outfit that, of course, he never got many of

23:09.921 --> 23:17.267
the headlines in the big papers or on television. 
And that's why none of them would want to come and

23:17.872 --> 23:21.277
stay with us. But when they'd get a rumor of a big 
operation, they'd start showing up. Of course, we

23:27.667 --> 23:29.570
were obligated to give them transportation. 
Usually it's air transportation in our outfit. So

23:32.615 --> 23:34.418
you had to take them with you onto the battlefield? 
Oh, yes. Or if you got into a big fight and there was a

23:36.060 --> 23:44.593
lot of smoke and fire and blood and casualties, 
boy, they'd come pouring in. And where they wanted

23:44.653 --> 23:45.735
to be, was where the fire and smoke and blood was. 
Because that's the way they'd get time on TV and a

23:50.046 --> 23:57.192
byline in the press. And I guess you can't blame the 
individual. He's competing. But the thing that

24:03.858 --> 24:13.107
upset me was that there was no one, no one in 
prominence, in the media, representing the

24:14.015 --> 24:30.779
media, who was in any way really tying together the 
actions we were in or that our corps was in or that

24:14.015 --> 24:30.779
all the effort in Vietnam was involved in. What it 
really amounted to in many ways was that our people

24:32.842 --> 24:42.435
back home were fed news-wise primarily horror and 
disasters and failures and that just doesn't make

24:43.428 --> 24:54.004
any sense. Did your commanders or Westmoreland, 
did they have any comments on this? I'm sure they

25:00.935 --> 25:01.756
did. I have personally, I've discussed this with 
many of the people.

25:13.043 --> 25:13.764
What's the team?

25:16.507 --> 25:19.191
Kovacs, somebody in Kovacs in the Washington 
Post? That's his name. Anyway, people like him and

25:22.735 --> 25:42.139
the Allsop, Stuart Allsop, and I could name others 
if I could just be nimble enough to think, would

25:22.735 --> 25:42.139
come over about once every six months and 
refurbish their expertise so they could go back

25:22.735 --> 25:42.139
home and write critical articles. I'd often ask 
them why their or their press

25:42.828 --> 26:10.759
service or their TV network didn't send somebody 
to try to get a picture of this whole war and they'd

25:42.828 --> 26:10.759
always say you can't get on the nightly news with 
that kind of stuff you can't get on the front page of

25:42.828 --> 26:10.759
that kind of stuff what does that say about 
American society It says to me that our free press

26:11.313 --> 26:19.785
in time of war has to be controlled on the battle 
area. There's no doubt in my mind. Now, I'm not

26:24.751 --> 26:32.502
saying don't report the smoke and fire and blood, 
but I'm saying report it all. Somehow, get full

26:34.144 --> 26:36.948
information to the people. I don't mean full 
detail, but full perspective. And if you can't get

26:41.722 --> 27:08.398
that, I think under any circumstances, you've got 
to have censorship not to primarily to see that our

26:41.722 --> 27:08.398
people back home aren't influenced improperly, 
but primarily to deny the enemy the benefit of the

26:41.722 --> 27:08.398
kind of reporting that occurred in Vietnam. It's 
just not a fair thing to do. to our troops. Speaking

27:14.191 --> 27:18.455
of your troops, what about the quality? You said a 
little bit earlier that you wanted to talk about

27:18.496 --> 27:28.307
the quality of the enlisted men and the soldiers 
under your command and their morale. Would you

27:28.847 --> 27:30.149
address that? You bet. Now, keep in mind that we 
were, in a way, a special outfit. We had been formed

27:36.245 --> 27:43.616
and trained, organized and trained to be a test 
division with a brand new concept. And it turned

27:45.059 --> 27:48.404
out to be a dramatic thing. Most of those men who 
trained with us came overseas with us. They were

27:56.416 --> 27:57.818
very well trained. Even though a lot of them were 
draftees, because you see, they would have been

28:05.557 --> 28:09.521
brought into the division and still had at least a 
year to do. If they did still have a year to do, they

28:10.201 --> 28:12.924
went with us. So that's why I say most of the men who 
came over with us. The average age of these

28:17.829 --> 28:22.393
troopers was down in the low 20s. Some of our senior 
non-coms were, of course, past 30. And most of our

28:26.837 --> 28:32.863
officers were 40 or under, of course. But we had 
trained them. And

28:35.307 --> 28:42.398
I was very proud of them. I thought that they were 
just as splendid soldiers. I never saw in World War

28:46.244 --> 28:48.448
II.

28:51.353 --> 29:02.310
I wouldn't say that,

28:51.353 --> 29:02.310
I would say that the courage and the capabilities 
of our soldier in Vietnam would match the first

29:03.691 --> 29:05.534
year in World War II. Now I say the first year in 
World War II because in World War II there was no

29:05.554 --> 29:13.224
rotation. Everybody became better and better and 
almost automatic. It didn't become a casualty to

29:16.949 --> 29:20.394
build that unit. And there were cheerful 
soldiers. Then in Vietnam, at the end of the first

29:25.942 --> 29:29.867
year Of course, by the end of the first year, we'd 
lost a number of casualties, and also those who

29:30.623 --> 29:36.470
remained were eligible to go home. Some 
volunteered to remain. But practically all the

29:39.233 --> 29:46.761
old team, so to speak, left on rotation and were 
replaced. I think it was my good fortune that I

29:49.024 --> 29:55.911
remained for another six months. And one of the 
reasons, of course, was the one general officer

29:59.362 --> 30:13.281
who could remain and see this transition and 
training of the new people, because General

29:59.362 --> 30:13.281
Kennard had a big job to come back to. And

30:13.321 --> 30:27.320
the replacements were mostly young people, and I 
thought they were, you couldn't have asked for

30:13.321 --> 30:27.320
better replacements. You have the natural 
problem of getting everybody back up into good

30:29.500 --> 30:33.545
teamwork and training. We were engaging units of 
divisions,

30:36.027 --> 30:47.460
extremely tough operations in many cases, and 
they just measured up splendidly. It hurts me to

30:47.700 --> 30:57.111
hear the Vietnamese veteran or the soldier in 
Vietnam criticized and blasphemed and really I

30:58.829 --> 31:10.644
just can't believe that after I'd been there a year 
that things fell apart and became so different.

31:13.828 --> 31:19.856
Because the same kind of people were there for the 
next year and a half. Same kind of people. I think

31:22.279 --> 31:25.123
we've done a great disservice because We all 
became so unhappy with that war that we let that

31:27.213 --> 31:35.004
unhappiness reflect on the troops that were 
fighting that war. Now, I wasn't there to see that

31:36.426 --> 31:43.515
the dope problem became so big. I think we've had a 
lot of talk about the grenading by the soldiers of

31:43.636 --> 31:52.287
their sergeants or their officers. I just don't 
know the statistics on that. But I'd bet my last

31:57.233 --> 32:07.745
dollar that they were magnified beyond the true 
dimensions by quite a lot. We knew when our

32:07.765 --> 32:26.245
division settled into the base at On Kay, we 
immediately knew through our CID agents that

32:07.765 --> 32:26.245
heroin, for example, was being made available 
right there in that It was coming in from outside.

32:29.787 --> 32:30.968
The opportunities were there. I'm sure all forms 
of dope. And we just, our commander told that

32:36.517 --> 32:46.312
leadership of that community, if this becomes a 
problem, these troops will never be allowed in

32:36.517 --> 32:46.312
your city. And by golly, I think they very 
effectively got a hold of it. in the Army has the

32:54.119 --> 32:57.282
capability to keep up with these things pretty 
well. We kept up with it, I think, quite well. You

33:00.765 --> 33:01.926
didn't have a drug problem. We didn't have a drug 
problem that we were aware of. Apparently

33:06.291 --> 33:11.235
marijuana became more significant as time went 
on. We were not aware of a problem, and I believe we

33:11.255 --> 33:17.821
would have been. The division commander has too 
many sources that are looking out for these things

33:22.908 --> 33:34.626
for him, for him to go through a period of that much 
time in ignorance on it.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.208
I'm referring to my division commander. I 
commanded that division for a month

33:36.288 --> 33:47.084
on a temporary occasion when the commander was out 
of the country, but I'm referring to our assigned

33:36.288 --> 33:47.084
division commander. I don't believe that

33:55.645 --> 34:09.205
the drug problem

33:55.645 --> 34:09.205
ever caused us to lose casualties significantly. 
It just never came to our attention.

34:13.731 --> 34:20.421
How about the problems of the guerrilla warfare 
versus the problems of a linear war, World War II,

34:13.731 --> 34:20.421
conventional war? Did you adapt very well to those 
problems? Who's the enemy, for example? Things

34:27.925 --> 34:29.167
that lead to my lies. Yeah. Me lie was, some would 
say it was an aberration. It was really

34:36.799 --> 34:48.437
unquestionably a

34:36.799 --> 34:48.437
deliberate event. It was a... clearly an atrocity 
of war.

34:55.827 --> 34:59.993
Incidentally, you mentioned that, so I'll say a 
few things about it. I was not there. No, of course

35:01.655 --> 35:03.819
not. It was in a division commanded by a good friend 
of mine, by the way. Who's that? John Sam Costner,

35:09.787 --> 35:16.197
contemporary and a good friend of mine. I was chief 
related liaison when Eli happened and And I got the

35:19.497 --> 35:48.424
first letter from this young fella riding Uber,

35:19.497 --> 35:48.424
who wrote the letter to the Chief of Staff of the 
Army, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the

35:19.497 --> 35:48.424
House Armed Services Committee, in which he, as I 
recall, it was over two pages typewritten, in

35:19.497 --> 35:48.424
which he passed on what a friend of his, a friend who 
had had been his friend in training in the States,

35:48.657 --> 35:54.403
and they went to separate units in Vietnam and then 
met over there. And this friend told him about that

35:54.683 --> 35:56.505
incident. And this young fellow, Ridenhoover, I 
think his name was, felt his conscience demanded

35:58.266 --> 36:06.554
that he inform the authorities on it. And the first 
letter received was by the chairman of the House

36:09.357 --> 36:17.365
Armed Services Committee.

36:17.733 --> 36:19.275
Representative Mendel Rivers.

36:22.718 --> 36:28.785
And he looked at it and he said, get this over to the 
back of the Army Legislative Liaison. I read it and

36:29.386 --> 36:32.409
I couldn't believe it, but I had the same reaction. 
I better get this to the chief of staff. And I had it

36:34.451 --> 36:38.295
in there in a matter of minutes. And they looked at 
it, he looked at it, and he said, well, we've got to,

36:39.937 --> 36:46.204
we've got to, look at this and quickly, and he 
assigned the Inspector General to look into it,

36:46.522 --> 37:00.499
and within a matter of days, he established that 
there was enough fact there that it had to be

36:46.522 --> 37:00.499
investigated in detail. And then, of course, this 
whole investigation process started.

37:06.006 --> 37:15.297
And I will comment that after it was all over, there 
were so many people defending

37:06.006 --> 37:15.297
Lieutenant Calley From what I had learned, and I 
learned subsequently, I was in part in error. From

37:22.898 --> 37:45.553
what I'd learned about this whole process, and I 
was very closely, of course, concerned with this

37:22.898 --> 37:45.553
investigation and abreast of it because of the 
Congress's interest, that as far as that incident

37:22.898 --> 37:45.553
was concerned, Calley was the 
commander-in-chief because he was the officer in

37:22.898 --> 37:45.553
charge, and this piece of ground, there wasn't 
anybody else I subsequently learned that his

37:46.613 --> 37:53.261
commander knew about what Calley had done. 
Medina? Medina. Captain Medina. But he was tried

37:55.423 --> 37:57.686
and found innocent of it. But the fact is, I'm told, 
by good authority, that he did know about it and

37:57.706 --> 38:05.535
that he knew about it when it happened. So under 
those circumstances, I felt that Calley wasn't

38:07.497 --> 38:14.285
the fall guy for anybody. It was his initiative. He 
was the only one there to control this thing, and he

38:15.520 --> 38:18.463
did it. And he personally killed a lot of those 
people.

38:24.328 --> 38:36.759
And my view of it is, and I think most people in the 
Army felt, it's absolutely inexcusable

38:24.328 --> 38:36.759
behavior, unacceptable, no matter what the 
circumstances. And the American people will

38:38.861 --> 38:42.945
never support an army that uses its capabilities 
in such a fashion, even on a small scale. It's just

38:51.613 --> 38:57.118
un-American, it's inhuman, it's against the 
rules of war and everything else. Anyway,

38:58.239 --> 39:04.265
I'm getting way off the subject here. No, I want 
your ideas. What was our general approach here

39:05.767 --> 39:11.532
that I'm diverting from? guerrilla war, the 
problems of guerrilla war. Of course, this is one

39:14.115 --> 39:15.977
of them. Did you know of any situations under your 
command that were similar to this in which you went

39:16.598 --> 39:30.175
into a village and mistook? We had one atrocity 
that was a crime, at least, that I was aware of. And

39:39.912 --> 39:42.956
again, here's the case of a soldier that had direct 
knowledge. His conscience told him he had to

39:43.637 --> 39:47.141
report it. One of our patrols of five men

39:47.161 --> 40:00.317
was ordered to leave at night and go patrol a 
certain area, going on a three-day patrol, and led

39:47.161 --> 40:00.317
by a sergeant. And they left early one evening and 
were to be gone three days. And they were out on a

40:08.380 --> 40:14.587
really a reconnaissance to try to see what the 
enemy was doing in a certain area, quite an area's

40:08.380 --> 40:14.587
distance away. That'd be dangerous. It is. But on 
their way out of this village, taking off on this

40:17.310 --> 40:27.422
thing, they kidnapped a young girl and took her 
with them for their pleasure. And after the second

40:29.624 --> 40:34.810
day, as I recall, Consciences began to bother and 
some rumbling apparently. And the girl was

40:42.022 --> 40:46.326
getting in bad shape. And so one of the men murdered 
her, killed her, and left her there.

40:54.875 --> 40:57.798
That's the worst that I know of. And I consider that 
to be an aberration. Here's a case where a

41:00.441 --> 41:05.286
non-commissioned officer just

41:07.139 --> 41:31.763
had developed a disrespect for these people it had 
to be that way and so we'll just take one of these

41:07.139 --> 41:31.763
gooks with us you know and of course proper justice 
was done what happened to these they were tried and

41:07.139 --> 41:31.763
well there was one man who didn't participate or 
two one or two who did not participate but the

41:07.139 --> 41:31.763
others were court-martialed and given very

41:37.447 --> 41:47.822
report this incident to the division commander of 
that Vietnamese division I cited a moment ago,

41:37.447 --> 41:47.822
because we felt he should know that we knew and that 
justice would be done. He didn't know, but we felt

41:50.526 --> 41:54.091
that he might have learned it some other way. But in 
any case, he should be informed. But the guerrilla

41:57.796 --> 42:07.150
warfare aspect was mainly a disruptor of the civil 
populace and of the South Vietnamese of small

42:07.467 --> 42:09.891
governing units, basically. They'd come into 
these little district headquarters and try to

42:10.972 --> 42:20.948
disrupt things, raise cane, kill government 
employees, and so forth. In a way, you can look at

42:22.270 --> 42:36.411
the whole North Vietnamese and Viet Cong 
operation as a guerrilla operation because, but I

42:22.270 --> 42:36.411
might add,

42:22.270 --> 42:36.411
we didn't have a great deal of contact with that 
kind of guerrilla. And therefore, as I've said, we

42:41.493 --> 42:51.665
were dealing mainly with uniformed soldiers, so 
identifying anyone wasn't too difficult. But we

42:51.685 --> 43:07.343
went over there with a very simple set of five rules 
of engagement that were designed to not shoot

42:51.685 --> 43:07.343
innocent people and not shoot up innocent 
villages. or to kill innocent people, but to

43:08.268 --> 43:12.814
protect our troops. And they were applied really, 
tried to, we just leaned over backwards not to hurt

43:13.995 --> 43:24.608
innocent people. And I'm sure in some cases it cost 
us some casualties, but we felt we had to be

43:24.628 --> 43:37.144
conservative on that because it would have been 
too bad to ever let it get out of hand, you know. You

43:37.647 --> 43:39.089
just don't shoot on fear. But I said the whole 
thing, in a sense, could be looked upon as

43:40.191 --> 43:52.128
guerrilla operation because these North 
Vietnamese divisions we were fighting basically

43:40.191 --> 43:52.128
were hanging over borders to fight us. For 
example,

43:53.870 --> 44:04.465
some of our toughest fights were over on the 
Vietnamese-Cambodian border.

44:08.090 --> 44:29.253
The enemy had his headquarters, his logistics 
installations, his medical facilities, all of

44:08.090 --> 44:29.253
his important support and command elements in the 
sanctuary across the border. And they'd

44:29.273 --> 44:37.422
infiltrate to put supplies and ammunition and so 
forth forward for a period of operations. and then

44:37.925 --> 44:42.850
infiltrate the troops and then get them together 
and then have it us. Well, we would defeat them. But

44:46.273 --> 44:56.584
you could kill every one of those men and you 
haven't destroyed that division because the

44:46.273 --> 44:56.584
things that make it build, train, and fight are 
still back there. And in that sense, the whole

44:58.786 --> 45:04.212
thing was, in a sense, a guerrilla operation.

45:07.034 --> 45:07.695
This is when it course we wanted the worst way in our 
division with the capabilities we had to be

45:08.654 --> 45:37.665
permitted to go across that border between South 
Vietnam and Laos and South Vietnam and Cambodia

45:08.654 --> 45:37.665
and it's just something that was never even the 
good soldiers you know Westmoreland and all of

45:08.654 --> 45:37.665
them just said

45:08.654 --> 45:37.665
that's not

45:08.654 --> 45:37.665
our guidance is we're not going to do that so just 
forget it But we felt we could stop that Ho Chi Minh

45:38.928 --> 45:56.789
Trail with our command and support echelons in 
South Vietnam with our operating combat troops

45:38.928 --> 45:56.789
going into Laos and Cambodia. And with our 
capability, we could flit around here and there

45:56.810 --> 46:05.560
and not ever become pinned down where they could 
concentrate mass against us. I might tell you one

46:07.868 --> 46:09.450
instance there. It was during a period that I was in 
command of the division and we were operating with

46:09.931 --> 46:25.594
a brigade over on the Cambodian, very near the 
Cambodian border, right on the border as a matter

46:09.931 --> 46:25.594
of fact. And

46:26.576 --> 46:36.250
the other brigades were back over to the east.

46:36.270 --> 46:37.352
One of our battalions, This is one of the tragedies 
of our experience. Lost an entire platoon, less a

46:42.175 --> 46:48.764
squad that had left and moved separately to an 
ambush. This means we lost three squads of men, the

46:48.784 --> 46:56.074
artillery observer party with them. It was a total 
of 30 some odd men, 20 high.
