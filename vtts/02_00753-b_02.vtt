WEBVTT

00:05.043 --> 00:09.190
I believe you left William & Mary in 46 then? That's 
correct and I went from there first to back to East

00:09.210 --> 00:15.560
Central State College. Taught there about

00:15.921 --> 00:22.732
nine weeks, summer term only. There I went to 
University of Oklahoma. I think probably my

00:28.634 --> 00:58.303
contacts while I was there and before, and my 
contacts in the Texas Academy, Oklahoma Academy

00:28.634 --> 00:58.303
in the early days, put me in line for a job with them, 
and I hadn't anymore, and hit Oklahoma again, and

00:28.634 --> 00:58.303
Dr. Richards, head of the Department of Biology, 
offered me a job, so, and I took it. What was that

00:59.937 --> 01:00.858
job? I was limnologist for the biological survey, 
University of Oklahoma Biological Survey. I did a

01:10.088 --> 01:16.875
little teaching in the LD rank of full professor in 
zoology. You say you did a little teaching. Does

01:18.216 --> 01:20.278
that imply you did primarily research? Yes, it was 
almost all research in limnology.

01:29.603 --> 01:33.729
My correct limnology is the study of the seashore? 
No, it's the equivalent of that, but it means the

01:34.470 --> 01:44.965
study of aquatic, freshwater aquatic plants. And 
I studied lakes and rivers and ponds and what have

01:44.985 --> 01:52.917
you all over the state. It's a beautiful town. But 
you only stayed there for one year? Yes, that's

01:59.135 --> 02:04.441
correct.

02:04.522 --> 02:08.366
Dr. Hopkins was responsible for tearing loose 
from over there. This Project 9 thing had reared

02:10.569 --> 02:27.910
its head and he was put in charge of it and he had to 
have someone to take over the field work in

02:10.569 --> 02:27.910
Louisiana

02:10.569 --> 02:27.910
where the study was to be made. and

02:29.408 --> 02:56.715
I didn't really care much about going to 
Louisiana, living down

02:29.408 --> 02:56.715
in the Boone docks, but they made it worth my while 
financially, and the University of Oklahoma

02:29.408 --> 02:56.715
didn't seem to be very much interested in keeping 
me. this job. I took a leave of absence

02:58.401 --> 03:16.605
to go, I remained with the University of Oklahoma 
while I was in

02:58.401 --> 03:16.605
Louisiana working on this Project 9. Had the 
research work already started when you... Yes,

03:20.790 --> 03:24.475
Dr. Hopkins had organized part of the elements of 
it, and the personnel

03:25.079 --> 03:40.073
problems were being taken care of by Dr. Doak, who 
was head of the Department of Biology before I got

03:25.079 --> 03:40.073
there. So I came in

03:40.093 --> 03:52.065
probably two or three months or more after the 
project had been set up by Dr. Hopkins. but they

03:52.940 --> 03:56.927
still had no one to run the field work in Louisiana. 
And I know I've heard about Project 9. Would you

04:02.978 --> 04:09.109
tell us what the purpose of this research project 
was? what the project was about? Yes, what was

04:11.332 --> 04:13.215
Project 9 all about? The Project 9 was occasioned 
by, I think, a concatenation of circumstances.

04:23.212 --> 04:34.270
Primarily, along in 1946 and 7, oystermen

04:23.212 --> 04:34.270
began to sue the oil companies. Now the reason for 
this suit was that a previous suit against Texaco,

04:34.756 --> 04:56.781
which had been tried about ten years prior to that, 
in the mid-thirties, had been here in the courts

04:34.756 --> 04:56.781
all of this time, and it was a pollution suit 
against Texaco. Then the state Supreme Court

04:58.448 --> 05:09.963
reversed the original ruling, which had been in 
favor of Texaco, the district court. As soon as

05:09.983 --> 05:23.820
this reversal became known, the Oysterman fell 
all over themselves to join the bandwagon and sue

05:09.983 --> 05:23.820
the oil companies, which they did. The oil 
companies, Texaco leading, organized to

05:27.423 --> 05:45.347
have the whole business studied as closely as 
possible and as extensively as possible and set up

05:27.423 --> 05:45.347
project nine. What was the claim of the oystermen? 
You said there was a claim for pollution. It was

05:51.615 --> 05:59.388
purely a pollution claim that the oysters were 
dying because of toxic effects of oil. That was

06:01.011 --> 06:03.235
their claim, exactly. The claims amounted to 
somewhere around $32 million. I added this up

06:09.776 --> 06:11.357
myself. I have copies of all of the petitions, and I 
added them up, and that's what they came to. That

06:18.363 --> 06:20.004
was lots of money in those days. Still is today, in 
fact. Still is.

06:29.693 --> 06:34.977
The man who really organized all of this business 
and ramrodded it was Dr. Jack, head of the Research

06:35.783 --> 06:42.290
Foundation. I assume that you know about that? Not 
a whole lot, no. I knew that he had headed the

06:47.235 --> 06:52.920
Research Foundation initially.

06:52.940 --> 06:58.045
He was the man who really ramrodded the whole 
business. A dynamic sort of a man. An

07:00.648 --> 07:04.592
engineer. and one of the best of the engineer 
researchers. His field was bridges. I've seen his

07:12.710 --> 07:17.115
bibliography on suspension bridges. He was a

07:17.195 --> 07:30.850
very fine man to work for and with and he took a great 
deal of interest in all of everything that went on.

07:31.471 --> 07:42.188
was over in Louisiana, poking his nose into 
everything, and generally seeing to it that it

07:31.471 --> 07:42.188
ran. Really a job that Dr. Jackula was not fitted 
for,

07:44.492 --> 07:57.293
and I think put him under a great mental strain all 
of the time. because he was a researcher and he

07:57.678 --> 08:12.594
would prefer to sit in some back office and do his 
bridge work rather than what he was doing, but he

07:57.678 --> 08:12.594
nevertheless did a tremendously good job. So the 
oil companies led by Texaco then came to Texas A&M

08:14.496 --> 08:19.802
and asked... Yes, all of them excepting one that 
were involved and that one was Gulf Oil Company.

08:28.019 --> 08:32.488
carried their own investigations separately. 
And we have a man on the faculty who worked with them

08:33.651 --> 08:37.860
at the same time. This is Dr. Sammy Ray at the 
laboratory at Galveston. And of course Sammy and I

08:43.411 --> 08:48.542
got to know each other at that time. So their 
question to, their request to A&M was to

08:48.522 --> 08:56.289
investigate the cause of the death of the Western. 
That's right. It was simply to take into

08:57.590 --> 09:07.860
consideration every possible cause that could be

08:57.590 --> 09:07.860
considered. That's the way we started out. I think 
we eliminated oil before we eliminated anything

09:12.824 --> 09:16.808
else. It was the easiest one of all of them, but it 
was less than a year before I knew that disease was

09:18.155 --> 09:37.353
the cause.

09:37.373 --> 09:40.156
To make a long story short, that's the way it came 
out. There were actually three investigations of

09:40.637 --> 09:46.322
that

09:52.208 --> 09:54.812
of the mortalities of oysters in Louisiana. One of 
them was by Gulf.

10:00.161 --> 10:08.915
Maybe I should say four, because Freeport 
Sufferer was also accused of all of these things,

10:00.161 --> 10:08.915
as well as the oil companies. They set up a study,

10:08.935 --> 10:17.929
and the state of Louisiana set up a study. The state 
of Louisiana chose a man conveniently for

10:19.732 --> 10:40.845
me and for Dr. Hopkins because they chose a man with 
whom we had worked together at the Virginia

10:19.732 --> 10:40.845
Fisheries Laboratory, Dr. Malcolm Owen. Dr. Owen 
had gone from Virginia Fisheries to South

10:42.361 --> 10:58.960
Carolina, I believe, and then the state of 
Louisiana hired him to investigate the same

10:42.361 --> 10:58.960
mortalities that we were investigating.

10:58.980 --> 11:09.853
Gulf Oil Company carried on their investigation, 
and Fleet Force Suffolk carried on theirs,

10:58.980 --> 11:09.853
Project 9, all separately. Three-fourths sulfur 
has never released any data about their

11:11.740 --> 11:17.048
investigations. They did not investigate 
disease or anything except in whether or not

11:18.391 --> 11:25.842
sulfur was the cause.

11:27.705 --> 11:31.592
The other three came to the same conclusion. All 
three of us arrived at exactly the same conclusion

11:31.612 --> 11:37.461
that disease was the factor. and when the original 
description of the disease came out, this

11:37.947 --> 11:50.984
description was a joint paper by the heads of the 
three groups. Dr. Rowan, Mr. Collier, now at

11:51.004 --> 12:02.959
Florida State, and Project Nine.

12:07.377 --> 12:15.630
How

12:07.377 --> 12:15.630
long a term project was this? I mean, how long did it 
take to determine this? The Project 9 project, I

12:21.079 --> 12:33.418
was in it for two and a half years, from the middle of 
1947 to 1950,

12:21.079 --> 12:33.418
January 1950. It was in January of 1950 that Dr. 
Jacula talked me into coming to the faculty. Prior

12:42.069 --> 12:44.775
to that, I was with the Research Foundation only. 
and then he talked me into joining the newly

12:46.088 --> 12:58.927
developed Department of Oceanography, which he 
was the man who really envisioned this and put it

12:46.088 --> 12:58.927
together. The same man that

12:59.148 --> 13:06.439
put together the Project 9. Now when Project 9 
ended,

13:14.810 --> 13:18.314
I guess December the 31st, 1950. Then the oil 
companies began another project, which was 23,

13:18.374 --> 13:34.310
and I was ahead of that, reduced my staff down to a 
small number of people. I had maybe five or six at

13:34.330 --> 13:41.357
most, and this is all I needed. because by that time 
we knew what was not killing oysters and where to

13:42.603 --> 13:59.880
put our efforts and I didn't want these, I didn't 
want the huge development of that project to start

13:42.603 --> 13:59.880
with. I was against that part of it. We spent 
several millions of dollars and The whole

14:09.738 --> 14:25.520
project, if they had turned it over to Dr. Hopkins 
and me and two or three others, we could have done

14:09.738 --> 14:25.520
the whole job for a tenth of what they spent.

14:25.560 --> 14:30.367
Maybe your answer wouldn't have been convincing 
if you hadn't spent a lot of money on it. We were

14:30.387 --> 14:34.413
accused of hiring all of the experts in the United 
States on our side. This was by the oyster mission.

14:38.218 --> 14:39.340
Yeah, of course.

14:42.880 --> 15:03.210
Project 9 was a great project and it was a 
revelation to me because I had never been paid

14:42.880 --> 15:03.210
money, big money, except for the university job I 
had and that was just a salary for doing research

14:42.880 --> 15:03.210
and doing it the way I wanted to. That's where they 
spoiled me. Project 9 you mean? Yeah. What was

15:10.758 --> 15:12.701
Project 23? Project 23 was mainly a project which 
changed its direction. First, we were continuing

15:23.315 --> 15:29.644
studies in these diseases.

15:31.936 --> 15:45.275
We had described this disease, but we didn't 
really know very much about it, excepting that we

15:31.936 --> 15:45.275
did know that it killed oysters, like nobody's 
business.

15:45.295 --> 16:01.639
But the rest of the story, the biological end of it, 
is far from

15:45.295 --> 16:01.639
being brought to a sufficient close.

16:02.463 --> 16:08.834
we had that problem to finish up. The other 
problem, it was a sort of a general problem which

16:09.936 --> 16:26.344
had to do with the examination of the operations of 
the oil companies as a whole, and we pretty

16:09.936 --> 16:26.344
abruptly dropped most of the oil studies in that, 
but there are so many others, such as the effects of

16:26.543 --> 16:44.662
the dredging of canals and the marshlands, an 
immense number of other things of this sort. So, we

16:44.682 --> 16:48.026
took over these investigations. That's what we 
did for about 10 years. Simply What it amounted to,

16:56.108 --> 17:02.818
the oil companies let me spend as much time as I 
wanted to on my parasitological problem. Then I

17:03.599 --> 17:09.247
helped them solve their problems in other ways. 
The problem of the effect of their operations on

17:10.449 --> 17:21.746
the biota and the environment. Incidentally, on 
people and other things. Did you ever track down

17:25.437 --> 17:31.202
the source of the disease in the oysters? The 
source? The organism? Oh yes, since that time I

17:34.465 --> 17:54.904
have discovered a half a dozen of other diseases of 
oysters and have worked with many many people

17:34.465 --> 17:54.904
including the federal government

17:55.913 --> 18:16.502
In fact, I set up the first laboratory for the 
federal government to help them set it up and

17:55.913 --> 18:16.502
taught their basic personnel how to go about 
studying disease problems at laboratories at

17:55.913 --> 18:16.502
Oxford and Maryland. I took a leave of absence from 
Texas A&M about in 63, I believe, and spent a summer

18:21.209 --> 18:32.862
over there just getting them straightened out so 
that they could go. So this later project, While

18:37.932 --> 18:52.307
every once in a while this oil pollution problem 
would rear its head, and I continued to study it, it

18:37.932 --> 18:52.307
was nothing like the primary thing.

18:52.327 --> 18:58.074
The primary thing was mechanical operations of 
the oil companies. This meant structures,

18:58.194 --> 19:03.700
dredging, all of these things. I took nearly two 
years just to study the dredging problem alone.

19:10.889 --> 19:15.957
So you, I believe you said you were involved with 
Project 23 for about 10 years? Yes, up until 1960.

19:19.002 --> 19:26.193
Part

19:19.002 --> 19:26.193
of that time I lived in Louisiana, five years.

19:29.017 --> 19:38.432
Right after I took, came to the Division of 
Oceanography as professor of biological

19:29.017 --> 19:38.432
oceanography, I came Director of the Marine 
Laboratory at Galveston, and I set it up somewhere

19:39.509 --> 19:52.421
about 1951 or 2, I've forgotten now exactly when. I 
had two graduate students down there at that time,

19:52.441 --> 20:06.195
and we were on the campus of the medical school. 
They gave us a building down there to do this. but I

20:09.631 --> 20:12.334
didn't stay with that too long. I couldn't get 
enough money out of the school to tell the truth

20:13.896 --> 20:18.001
about it. By the school, Texas A&M. Yeah, that's 
right it is. The only money was our own projects. In

20:26.452 --> 20:37.045
other words, I was supposed to support the 
laboratory from my own projects, which I already

20:26.452 --> 20:37.045
had, which I did for a good while.

20:37.065 --> 20:37.866
But You can't build a laboratory that way. Let me 
see if I got this straight. You became professor of

20:43.534 --> 20:49.142
marine biology, I believe you said January 1950. 
Yes. Under sort of the pushing or pulling or

20:49.964 --> 20:55.112
whatever of Mr. Jackfield. That's right. He is the 
one who organized the department and supervised

20:56.594 --> 21:06.469
the getting of the personnel, the original 
personnel. You did that in 50 then, did you first

21:06.652 --> 21:12.859
begin offering courses in oceanography in the 
fall of 50? I think they had actually organized

21:12.879 --> 21:16.583
this before I came back in 50. It was organized in 
about 49 and they got Dale Leeper from Scripps and

21:16.603 --> 21:32.862
Dr. Price, geologist,

21:16.603 --> 21:32.862
I've forgotten.

21:35.947 --> 21:46.126
Oh yeah, Bob Reed was one of the original

21:35.947 --> 21:46.126
ones, and that's all of it at that time. Okay, and so 
for how long, what I'm not clear on is how long did

21:46.146 --> 21:52.477
you teach on campus here?

21:55.643 --> 21:59.490
For the first 10 years, I taught I actually taught 
around five years. And then this thing over in

22:06.230 --> 22:14.140
Louisiana got so big that they asked me to come back 
and stay over there. So I was still on the campus and

22:14.240 --> 22:20.669
still part of the faculty, but I went back to live 
over there. I lived there for five years until

22:20.689 --> 22:23.793
1960. By that time things were centering down 
again and

22:34.250 --> 22:37.835
so they offered me then the head of the Department 
of Biology. I came back in 1960 and took that over,

22:38.456 --> 22:51.014
but still retained my arrangement on a different 
basis with the oil companies. There was no project

22:51.175 --> 23:03.092
as such, but the school, as you know, allows a man to 
do a certain amount of consulting work and things

23:03.545 --> 23:09.654
of this sort about two days a month or something 
like that. So I had an arrangement, an actual

23:09.674 --> 23:22.192
agreement in writing with about five or six oil 
companies to continue this work with them to take

23:09.674 --> 23:22.192
care of their problems. So I continued working 
with that problem those problems as they came up

23:24.554 --> 23:27.878
and I'm still doing it today. Only today you can do 
it on a more frequent basis. I do it on a more

23:33.544 --> 23:37.588
frequent and intense basis now. At that point 
where you, during that five years that you lived in

23:38.810 --> 23:51.844
Louisiana, that five years between 1950 and 60, 
had you severed your connections with Texas A&M?

23:52.820 --> 24:05.023
No, I was on the faculty and came back over here 
every so often for general checkups and

23:52.820 --> 24:05.023
realignments and things of this sort. But my 
project through the Research Foundation, 23,

24:10.268 --> 24:12.674
simply took over my efforts. So you were, while you 
were still on the faculty, you weren't actually

24:13.236 --> 24:17.006
teaching any courses? Graduate students. I was 
teaching graduate students all that time and took

24:19.211 --> 24:25.628
at least two of them back with me over to Louisiana. 
gave them jobs and supervised their theses and

24:26.536 --> 24:32.544
dissertations over there. Do you have any quick 
recollection of how many theses and

24:32.924 --> 24:40.434
dissertations came out of Project 23? No, I sure 
don't. I do know that I have a number of men in pretty

24:43.798 --> 24:49.185
high positions.

24:51.106 --> 25:01.921
Al Sparks is some sort of a deputy bureaucrat in the 
Department of Interior and so on. Jerry Stein is

25:02.262 --> 25:12.656
with the Copley Foundation in California.

25:12.676 --> 25:15.881
I don't remember a lot of others, but I've got them 
scattered all over there. Oh yeah, I have two or

25:17.323 --> 25:19.746
three of them are that I had at Grand Isle working 
for them and now have PhDs and are in state colleges

25:20.063 --> 25:33.399
here, either in Louisiana or in Texas.

25:36.343 --> 25:49.058
It appeared to me at one point that it was might have 
been somewhat odd for you to jump from one

25:36.343 --> 25:49.058
department, say oceanography, over to the head of 
another department, biology, but then you've

25:36.343 --> 25:49.058
been always been a biologist. It didn't make any 
difference to me whether I was doing biology and

25:50.725 --> 25:57.776
oceanography or biology and biology. It doesn't 
make any difference to me whether or not there is a

25:59.058 --> 26:03.986
department at all. You mean any kind of 
department? Yeah, that's right, any kind of

26:07.031 --> 26:13.702
department. You were head of the biology 
department for what, 11 years? No, I believe

26:17.523 --> 26:19.306
seven. Approximately seven. And about 67, I got to 
be 65 years old, I believe it was, and of course you

26:21.209 --> 26:40.097
can't de-head it, after you get to be 65, so I became 
a professor of biology at that time. I ran along

26:40.137 --> 26:43.783
until 1970 when I retired.

26:46.598 --> 26:50.504
I mean from the university. As head of the biology 
department, did you do any teaching? Yes. I taught

26:56.433 --> 27:02.682
one freshman course the entire period, most of the 
period anyway. This was the freshman

27:02.702 --> 27:05.907
invertebrate course. and also taught at one time 
or other several graduate courses of various

27:06.292 --> 27:18.718
kinds. The principal of one of these was in the 
advanced

27:28.027 --> 27:29.729
field of symbiotics. Symbiotics, the 
relationships of organisms as disease and mutual

27:30.890 --> 27:41.862
associations and things of this sort. So I did 
teach all of the time. I never at any time had less

27:43.904 --> 27:50.170
than one course at a time. Usually I had two But only 
the lecture sections in the freshman course, the

27:53.693 --> 28:01.224
laboratories. These are the type where you have 
200 students and you walk in and throw it at them.

28:09.015 --> 28:10.217
Three days a week. That's right. They still have 
four hours of lab sometimes. They may have the four

28:13.501 --> 28:15.965
hours in the lab. I presume also you continue to 
direct graduate students in the theses and

28:15.985 --> 28:21.693
dissertations? Yes, throughout all of it.

28:27.106 --> 28:35.181
When I quit as head of department, I think I had 
about 10 or 12 graduate students at that time.

28:40.310 --> 28:51.190
I began cutting them down about that time, but I 
never really got through with all of them until

28:40.310 --> 28:51.190
about two or three years after I retired. Well, I 
would think that would be quite a load in itself to

28:53.144 --> 28:57.791
have 10 or 12 graduate students working on 
projects. It's supposed to be about three times a

28:58.071 --> 29:02.037
full-time job. I didn't find it that way at all. I 
could have taken that many more. Well, I'm sure a

29:08.346 --> 29:14.916
lot depends upon the students you have and the type 
of projects on which they're working. And the way

29:15.385 --> 29:20.413
you manage them. Some people can't take one 
graduate student to do it right. But it depends on

29:27.083 --> 29:29.848
who you are. Dr. Hopkins, keep track of all of them. 
It doesn't make much difference how many he has.
