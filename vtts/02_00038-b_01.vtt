WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:08.341
So that all of the big ones are held in Sabisa in that 
era? And then the big ones would be in Sabisa. It's

00:12.205 --> 00:13.647
the biggest building on campus. And the easiest to 
clear out and a good floor. And didn't have air

00:19.174 --> 00:25.542
conditioning in those days, and so you just let 
them go. You didn't know any difference, so it

00:25.882 --> 00:28.826
didn't matter. Do you remember any... Any 
escapades, any real good stories that had

00:31.486 --> 00:37.055
anything to do with the dance? That had anything to 
do with the dance? Anything that somebody did

00:41.742 --> 00:44.246
after a dance? No.

00:49.393 --> 00:52.919
I guess we were somewhat normal even for the day 
then. You see how far you get with the girl. Usually

00:56.945 --> 00:59.569
not very.

01:01.777 --> 01:16.718
It was expected there was a higher, I think that 
more was expected of you in those days than there is

01:01.777 --> 01:16.718
today. There were greater expectations of 
gentlemanliness.

01:24.862 --> 01:36.459
There was no hesitation for mothers to send their 
daughters to College Station because

01:24.862 --> 01:36.459
they're not going to come back pregnant. They're 
not going to go down and get drunk out of their mind

01:36.559 --> 01:43.670
because that doesn't happen at College Station. 
Who chaperoned? Who policed? Was there anybody

01:48.177 --> 01:51.662
walking around the room checking on behavior? 
There may have been. I wasn't aware they were not

01:53.219 --> 01:56.222
visible. Did you all have alcohol in Sevesa? No. We 
might have taken some in. It was not supposed to

02:04.831 --> 02:08.094
happen, but I'm sure that it did. Do you remember 
anybody getting embarrassingly drunk? Oh, yes.

02:11.638 --> 02:12.218
Oh, yes. At one time or another, all of us probably 
got embarrassingly drunk. Maybe more as a

02:18.264 --> 02:20.907
freshman than later on. And I think that's 
probably still true in university. Freshman,

02:24.178 --> 02:30.890
fresh out of home, didn't know how to handle it, and 
he stays drunk far more than a junior or senior.

02:30.910 --> 02:31.090
Right. Now, in your case, you started dating this 
special young lady when? What

02:35.298 --> 02:40.026
year? 1950. When you were a junior? 1951. 1951, we 
started dating. Did you by chance propose to her or

02:46.705 --> 02:51.719
get engaged at an Aggie event? No, it happened up 
here in Fort Worth. And we got married in 52. And

03:00.061 --> 03:02.267
she...

03:04.542 --> 03:06.744
We first lived on the campus. See, I was supposed to 
graduate in 52, but I had a bad habit of running out

03:07.505 --> 03:16.134
of money and not being able to keep going to school. 
So I would lay out for a semester in the summer, and I

03:16.814 --> 03:26.144
could earn enough money to go back to school for a 
semester. So where did y'all live when you were

03:27.085 --> 03:29.487
young married? The first place that we lived was in 
a garage apartment in Bryan, over near the lake by

03:29.585 --> 03:38.859
the golf course. Somewhere in there, off of one of 
those streets, we lived in a garage apartment. And

03:44.667 --> 03:55.643
then, the next time we were down, we lived on 
Eisenhower Street in College Station.

03:57.884 --> 04:05.156
I think that there is a bank or something. It's just 
off of University on Eisenhower Street. I think

04:11.507 --> 04:15.995
there's a bank or something right now that would 
back up to that little house. And this was a little

04:16.035 --> 04:17.698
bitty house. That house would fit in this room. 
What did she do while you were taking classes? Did

04:25.984 --> 04:26.565
she work? No, she didn't work. When we went back the 
second time, we had a child, my oldest daughter.

04:38.538 --> 04:42.122
So she had a little bitty baby. I remember one time 
in February, it was College Station. cold,

04:48.796 --> 04:52.764
raining, miserable February. And we lived in this 
little wooden house. And her mother came down. And

04:59.077 --> 05:03.767
Margaret was just crawling. just barely 
crawling, maybe pulling up a little bit. And she

05:08.180 --> 05:13.928
was in that cold, damp house, barefoot, with 
nothing but a diaper on. And her mama drove up in her

05:13.948 --> 05:23.160
brand new, big, long Cadillac automobile and came 
in and said, jumped on us and up that child. Where's

05:23.381 --> 05:25.383
the child going to die? What do you think? Let me get 
some shoes on. She outgrew her shoes, and we don't

05:28.207 --> 05:32.353
have any money, and we can't buy shoes.

05:35.489 --> 05:37.572
She's just going to have to suck it up. Ooh, that 
woman was mad. Well, that kid had shoes that

05:42.601 --> 05:45.946
afternoon, I'll guarantee you. Had everything 
that she could buy in the city of Bryan. Oh, she got

05:50.874 --> 05:55.903
mad at me, and she talked bad, too. Was there any 
kind of social activity for student wives?

06:01.780 --> 06:02.942
Nothing special. No. There was no student wives 
organization.

06:10.011 --> 06:15.218
The interesting thing is there were a lot of us who 
knew each other and who became friends. And so,

06:15.358 --> 06:21.146
again, on football weekends, you would assemble 
at one or the other houses. As I say, our entire

06:21.747 --> 06:25.111
house was about a big group. And yet we could get 
those girls with those great big dresses and you'd

06:25.251 --> 06:31.720
just put them around the walls, you understand. 
because of big old dresses and we could get five or

06:32.138 --> 06:55.125
six of them in

06:32.138 --> 06:55.125
there let's see let's go back to student 
organizations uh singing cadets were they saying

06:32.138 --> 06:55.125
cadets cadets were there the aggie players were 
there the uh there were there were organizations

06:55.865 --> 07:01.295
from almost each department, plus clubs of all 
types. What were hometown clubs for? It was really

07:05.524 --> 07:10.954
to cushion for the newcomers. More than a bunch of 
hometown people getting together across the

07:12.048 --> 07:15.692
hometown. It was a cushion for the kid who's just 
coming down there. Whether he's entered as a

07:20.517 --> 07:24.041
freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, it doesn't 
matter. Was it a ride-back-home organization

07:24.141 --> 07:26.503
also? I guess to a degree. Most of us just went over 
by the Safeway store and hitchhiked. Describe

07:33.671 --> 07:34.632
that routine. I always hitchhiked to the north. 
And you got... You've got to ride up to the Safeway

07:41.967 --> 07:51.216
store in Bride, which is where Highway 21 crosses 
6. How would you get, though, from the campus to

07:51.837 --> 07:53.919
there? The best way you could. However, if you 
hitchhike, you didn't accept a ride past that

07:56.361 --> 08:01.767
hitchhike point. If somebody says, well, I'm 
going all the way to Fort Worth, I'd have to say,

08:02.127 --> 08:10.776
well, thank you very much, sir, but you need to let 
me out there, and I bet there's one of those guys who

08:02.127 --> 08:10.776
wants to go to Fort Worth. And that was just the 
etiquette of hitchhiking. Now, what did you wear?

08:15.462 --> 08:16.804
Uniform. That'll get you right. Did you put your 
thumb up? Of course. Only one person. There may be

08:22.150 --> 08:26.475
20 people standing on the corner, but one person 
holds his thumb. All right. And who got to be first

08:27.216 --> 08:28.657
in line? The man holding his thumb. And then the 
next man in line is the man. But what made him first?

08:34.444 --> 08:36.066
Because he was there first. Rank had nothing to do 
with it. No, rank had nothing to do with it. Did you

08:41.159 --> 08:43.423
all drop handles while you were waiting? Yes. 
Okay. And was it normal for the car to stop, the

08:45.525 --> 08:53.797
vehicle to stop and give only one person a ride? No, 
I've seen the person by themselves take three,

08:53.817 --> 09:00.687
four, you know, whatever they could get in the car. 
Cars were big in those days. Now, you were coming,

09:02.569 --> 09:04.532
say, to Fort Worth. Where did you catch a ride out of 
Fort Worth to go back? Was there a special place?

09:11.050 --> 09:24.664
Yes, it was on the south side of Fort Worth on 
Hemphill Avenue, and I can't tell you exactly

09:11.050 --> 09:24.664
where it was, but it was an accepted, appointed 
place. I could probably drive down there and find

09:25.225 --> 09:27.667
it. By and large, were the only people standing at 
that place Aggies? Yes. Do you remember any

09:34.815 --> 09:37.918
goofy... humorous hitchhiking experiences? Not 
for me. I always got good rides. I never did get with

09:44.223 --> 09:46.266
any weird people. Never did run into anything like 
that. It just so happened I didn't. Did you ever

09:49.992 --> 09:53.818
hear of anybody who had a truly bad experience? Oh, 
yeah. I've heard of them who would get with drunks

09:55.119 --> 10:00.848
and get scared out of their wits and so forth. That 
was, I suppose, the most common thing. I got a ride.

10:04.073 --> 10:06.657
This guy was so drunk he couldn't stay on the road. 
But you don't remember anybody being

10:08.358 --> 10:13.424
robbed? No. No. No. Don't know of anything. Let's 
see. Other organizations. RVs? Oh, sure. Ross

10:20.753 --> 10:22.194
Wilde here has been there forever. Was that 
important? They were one of those elite

10:24.097 --> 10:32.847
organizations, and those were the dedicated 
military people. Single? Not married? Oh, yes.

10:36.906 --> 10:37.567
Not married. Single. Dedicated. They were there. 
They didn't care so much about the degree. They

10:44.317 --> 10:45.398
wanted the commission. Did you all use the phrase, 
gun home? I don't remember the use of it. We used the

10:51.426 --> 10:54.551
phrase, you know, he's a classic courtier. As you 
get on to be a senior, a lot of us... As a matter of

11:01.936 --> 11:09.088
fact, during my junior year was one of those times I 
had to drop out. Simply didn't have any money. And

11:11.832 --> 11:14.557
so I had to get out and go to work. And because I was 
forced to break, Korea is just over. And because I

11:23.932 --> 11:28.399
was forced to break of my service, The Army didn't 
want any more second lieutenants and they didn't

11:29.408 --> 11:36.338
find any reason in the world to break the contract. 
And so they did. So you're not in the Corps all of...

11:38.882 --> 11:43.008
No. And again, it was a condition of the times. The 
Army was looking to get rid of lieutenants. They

11:52.742 --> 11:55.045
didn't want any more lieutenants. It was for the 
convenience of both of us that the contract was

11:55.463 --> 11:59.929
terminated. What was the most prestigious 
student leadership positions? Well, the

12:05.857 --> 12:10.203
President's Student Body and Yellow Leader. 
Those were the... That was bigger than Corps

12:10.743 --> 12:14.308
Commander? Corps Commander was important to the 
Corps, but again, let's look back at post-World

12:14.328 --> 12:21.858
War II and post-Korea. The civilian population 
was growing rapidly. People who did not, although

12:28.464 --> 12:41.859
corps was required of high school graduates 
entering as freshmen, anybody with a military

12:28.464 --> 12:41.859
record was not required to go into the corps and 
they didn't want any more army. So those people

12:41.919 --> 12:53.972
were increasing in volume and so it was 
increasingly I'm moving to its position, I guess,

12:54.779 --> 13:00.686
that it has achieved today, where it's important. 
But to the overall, it's not as important,

13:01.387 --> 13:08.616
probably, as the political office is. What can you 
share, any information you know from any source

13:09.497 --> 13:16.165
about secret fraternities?

13:19.009 --> 13:21.412
One of my roommates was a member of the True Texans. 
So it did exist? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. About how many

13:24.848 --> 13:27.270
members were there? Fewer than 100. At one time? 
Yes. Oh, okay. Yes. And he was a member. And we

13:34.118 --> 13:37.382
kidded him about it. It wasn't a big deal to me. Bob 
was a member of it. And so what? Bob was politically

13:49.696 --> 13:52.900
active.

13:54.162 --> 13:56.244
And so it existed. What was their purpose? Social. 
They weren't trying to. They had no agenda that I

14:00.468 --> 14:03.130
was aware of. And certainly, I was within arm's 
length of it. Were they trying to get their members

14:08.135 --> 14:10.878
involved? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. They wanted their 
people to be the political people. That's what I

14:18.265 --> 14:19.766
thought. Yes. They made sure that their people 
were running for the elective offices and they

14:23.508 --> 14:27.342
made sure that they made the signs, gave the 
support, blah, blah, blah. And 90% of that is what

14:33.192 --> 14:39.580
name do you recognize, and that's who you vote for. 
You didn't listen to speeches and decide this is

14:40.561 --> 14:43.985
the best man for it. It was recognition, which they 
knew, so they flooded and generally achieved

14:44.005 --> 14:50.233
that. So they had some success. Oh, yes. And did 
that include Corps Commander and Head yell

14:57.443 --> 14:58.204
leader? I think it got so that, yes, it did include 
the yell leader. But I think it, because the corps

15:02.191 --> 15:18.897
commander was selected internally by the 
administration, it was less there, although my

15:02.191 --> 15:18.897
roommate was an adjutant on corps staff. At what 
point in his four years, as far as you know, did he

15:20.319 --> 15:25.307
become a member? His junior year. As far as you 
know, was that when they were selected? Did it

15:31.434 --> 15:36.260
matter Army, Air Force, Corps? Or not Corps.

15:40.065 --> 15:43.469
It happened mostly within the Corps. His car for me 
and went off in my car, which is air conditioned.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.337
And he said, your car needs gas. I knew that when he 
left. And he's appearing right now in Henry V.

15:52.523 --> 16:04.855
He's rehearsing As You Like It. They're doing 
Henry V and rehearsing As You Like It. They'll

16:09.940 --> 16:13.883
follow Henry V as you like it. As far as you know, did 
many other people know who were members of the TTs?

16:22.223 --> 16:29.291
I think everybody who was close to a member knew 
more than one member. When it blew up, when the

16:30.853 --> 16:34.958
thing blew up at the university. When was that? At 
that time I was, at that time my roommate was the

16:38.242 --> 16:44.529
editor of the battalion. His name was Frank 
Menezes. And when it first came out was that

16:48.599 --> 16:55.886
semester that Frank and I were living together. 
And Frank really said, you know, there's a good

16:55.946 --> 17:04.574
story here, but he didn't think it was worth 
anything. It became, it became a big deal for one

17:05.635 --> 17:14.284
reason or another to the administration. So this 
is the early 50s? Yes. It became became a big deal to

17:18.029 --> 17:23.119
the administration.

17:25.904 --> 17:28.329
And was probably a bigger deal to them. The back, 
Frank really, you know, it was page three stuff. We

17:36.457 --> 17:37.359
could get weak. When it was quiet on the campus, 
that might be page three and Frank and I would sit

17:37.659 --> 17:44.191
and make up things to go on page one. Did anything 
happen to the team members? Yes. Bob was on core

17:47.637 --> 17:50.702
staff and he was busted. As were all of them. yes 
they were all busted because that was a prohibited

17:54.985 --> 18:24.199
to have a secret because of the secrecy and as far as 
anybody knew how long had the tts been in existence

17:54.985 --> 18:24.199
i have no idea but it's been a long time i don't know 
either i think it was was there any other as far as

17:54.985 --> 18:24.199
you know there was none other than i was aware of 
have you ever heard anybody talk about the

17:54.985 --> 18:24.199
stickers apparently back in maybe even in the 20s 
there was And the name may have come from the word

18:24.466 --> 18:31.435
swastika. No brown shirts. No, no, no. It 
predates. Predates that? Yes. In the 20s, you see,

18:35.741 --> 18:38.084
the Nazi party didn't. That's right. The Navajo 
symbol for friendship was the swastika. And if you

18:43.611 --> 18:46.795
look through some early 20s, Longhorn, 
yearbooks, you'll see a cage or a swastika? Here

18:52.381 --> 18:52.943
and there. Here and there. I was not aware of that. 
All right. So do you know whether the TTs existed

18:56.412 --> 19:00.784
after the early 50s? They busted everybody, but 
the organization being independent, to the best

19:02.806 --> 19:17.828
of my knowledge, continued to be secret and they 
continued to associate with one another. I don't

19:17.808 --> 19:21.153
think they had formal bylaws. I don't think they 
had, I think they had loose group agendas. And I

19:27.262 --> 19:28.724
think that that continued. I don't believe that, 
at least for the time I was there, I don't, they

19:28.744 --> 19:41.502
injured them as individuals and the hope was, I 
guess, to put fear into it. But, and dissuade other

19:41.522 --> 19:45.047
people from doing this. But as long as I was there, I 
think they existed. All right, let's go back now to

19:49.131 --> 19:52.735
your first year or two. You didn't have a car. About 
how often did you go back and forth from home and

19:55.839 --> 20:02.147
how? I went home for Christmas. Thanksgiving? No. 
Really? No, but my freshman year, I think we played

20:08.475 --> 20:13.241
a game, College Station. So I didn't go home. But I 
went home for Christmas. And I didn't go home that

20:18.996 --> 20:23.863
much. I personally didn't go home that much. Do you 
remember having a date your freshman year?

20:33.778 --> 20:33.838
No. What about sophomore year?

20:38.785 --> 20:39.506
Not many. How did you get a date? Usually through a 
friend.

20:49.852 --> 20:52.395
He knows somebody in his hometown.

20:54.758 --> 20:55.999
Like this special young lady? He has a girlfriend 
at home and she has a friend. Like this special

21:00.645 --> 21:04.449
young lady who would mean so much to you. Did you 
know her? How did you meet her? That way. A friend of

21:09.275 --> 21:12.679
mine. had a had an aggie friend yes and she had a 
friend and uh it was court trip and uh that's how to

21:13.840 --> 21:41.535
fort worth no portrait actually oh okay i 
described the routine of the court trip either to

21:13.840 --> 21:41.535
any of the four oh you'd leave leave what what time 
and how did you get there well you got there the best

21:13.840 --> 21:41.535
way you could For you, what was that? Well, that was 
hitchhiking. Again, not uncommon. Simply not

21:48.661 --> 21:49.782
uncommon. You got there as best you could. You 
usually were able to get there by Friday night. And

21:57.772 --> 22:05.340
you then

21:57.772 --> 22:05.340
tried to find a place to stay. If somebody had a 
room, that usually meant 30 people could sleep,

22:06.101 --> 22:11.067
you see. Then there was the parade in the morning, 
and the game, and then everybody started, if you

22:11.890 --> 22:30.034
didn't have a date, you started trying to get out 
there, because there's a hell of a lot of people

22:11.890 --> 22:30.034
going to be hitchhiking going back. Now,

22:30.014 --> 22:41.670
usually within your outfit you had two or three 
guys from the big cities, or maybe four or five or

22:30.014 --> 22:41.670
more. And they had access to automobile once they 
got to the city. And that was how you got around. You

22:48.660 --> 22:53.406
stayed at homes, you stayed a little bit of 
everywhere. Can you describe how you met this

22:53.723 --> 22:58.049
young lady then? All right. My friend was going 
with a girl from Fort Worth and she had this friend.

23:06.983 --> 23:14.974
And we, he said, I can get, he arranged the date. I 
don't know whether it was at my insistence or at

23:15.014 --> 23:19.461
his, I don't remember. But at any rate, the date 
would be in Dallas, and she was going to TCU, but she

23:19.762 --> 23:32.941
was going to stay with a friend at SMU. And so we met, 
and we went to the game, and we were going out after

23:32.961 --> 23:42.075
the game, and I don't remember we were going 
somewhere. You're a sophomore? No, I'm a junior.

23:47.803 --> 23:48.925
Yeah, I'm a junior. And

23:49.377 --> 23:54.503
we had a good time. We enjoyed each other. We had a 
lot of fun and decided we wanted to see each other

23:55.985 --> 24:01.833
some more. It was a typical weekend. She got back a 
little bit late to the SMU dorm, but managed to get

24:07.840 --> 24:17.933
in through a window which was Everybody used it. It 
was the highway even for the girls that lived in the

24:19.452 --> 24:24.081
dorm. And then we met the next day and came to Fort 
Worth. And I met her parents who lived across the

24:29.851 --> 24:38.807
street from the girl the other guy was going with. 
And they invited me back the next weekend for some

24:39.243 --> 24:46.531
purpose, which escapes me. I don't remember, but 
it was something significant. And so I came back

24:50.275 --> 24:55.901
the next weekend and stayed with her at her home. 
And then I always had a place to stay. Did the Aggies

25:02.208 --> 25:07.714
in that game, that first day, did the Aggies score 
any touchdowns? So did this guy get to kiss his date

25:09.668 --> 25:15.078
at the first game? I'm sure we must have. I don't 
know that for sure because that was not during

25:19.946 --> 25:25.697
A&M's high departure period. And Kyle Rook was 
playing for the Mustangs in that era, I think.

25:30.285 --> 25:31.728
That's about 51 or 52. No, it's worse than that. 
It's Don Meredith.

25:39.723 --> 25:41.607
So did we score anything? I don't know. I wouldn't 
be absolutely certain about that. Let's see.

25:47.918 --> 25:53.990
Meredith and Bob Lilly was playing for TCU, so it 
wasn't a good time to be an Aggie. We didn't win a lot

25:54.431 --> 25:57.917
in those days. Campus characters, was Pinky 
around then? Pinky was around, not what Pinky was

26:01.829 --> 26:08.278
later on, but Pinky was on campus, yes. Lou, old 
Army Lou? Lou, Lou, you bet. Trade with Lou, he's

26:11.161 --> 26:14.966
right with you, yes sir. Lou, he helped everybody. 
Yes, he bought books from Lou, because you get them

26:16.849 --> 26:21.775
cheaper, Lou's, he'd always buy back. Were there 
any off-campus events in the United States or in

26:23.197 --> 26:28.123
the world during your student years that you 
remember caused you concern?

26:38.022 --> 26:40.746
Like was there anything going on in the Far East 
during that time? Well, Korea existed during that

26:40.846 --> 26:50.820
period of time, and that was of concern to us of 
cannon fodder age. But that's really all that was

26:51.712 --> 26:58.502
going on in the world that was of concern was Korea. 
But you were aware of your draft status? Oh, yes.

27:03.049 --> 27:03.569
Oh, yes. Yes, you knew absolutely. You had a 
student deferment. Did that have any

27:07.615 --> 27:16.168
encouragement to you to stay in school and keep 
making your grades? No, that was not significant

27:16.188 --> 27:20.875
to me. Yes, that would not have made a difference to 
me. There weren't any assassinations or

27:24.776 --> 27:27.299
bombings? No, no big deals like that. Sure, atomic 
weapons tests were going on, but we didn't think

27:30.743 --> 27:36.811
anything of that. That was just an interesting 
thing. Were there any great personalities that

27:39.173 --> 27:46.322
visited A&M during your days? Well, of course,

27:46.825 --> 27:59.296
we didn't have a president on campus during my four 
years. We had a governor.

28:05.607 --> 28:11.454
I think we did a parade for the governor, but what 
the hell do you see from the parade? What was his

28:11.834 --> 28:12.515
name? I don't remember. Shivers? Shivers may have 
been governor. I don't recall. But we would have,

28:17.661 --> 28:25.850
yes, the Corps would have passed and reviewed for 
him, but that would be about as close as you got.

28:26.571 --> 28:31.517
What were the most popular student indulgences at 
the time? Beer. Where'd you get it? out of Brazos

28:34.868 --> 28:42.362
County and bring it in. Where? Generally, just as 
quick as you can get across the Brazos River. And

28:50.637 --> 28:55.507
what was... Farm Road 60 going to Snoop, was it 
called Whiskey Bridge? Yes, yes, Whiskey Bridge.

28:58.882 --> 29:03.128
But beer was the big thing because it was cheap. Do 
you remember what label, what variety? Oh, yes.

29:07.434 --> 29:12.442
You drank Schlitz and Southern Select and Pearl. 
Grand Prize? I wasn't a Grand Prize drinker.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.673
You're not an old man. No. Oh, is that right? John 
Lindsay's. John Lindsay. Sarah. Sarah. Sarah's.

29:28.565 --> 29:32.991
Was hard liquor still there, Uncle Ed's? Yes. Can 
you describe Uncle Ed's? No, I'm sorry, just

29:39.179 --> 29:40.461
another place. Nothing outstanding stands out. 
And was there a gravel pit or a... Clay pits. Clay

29:48.932 --> 29:49.633
pits. That's where you went to do your drinking and 
you could swim in the clay pits. Where was it? down

29:55.902 --> 30:00.127
Welburn Road a little ways and off toward the 
river. And it was exactly that. It was old where it

30:03.952 --> 30:11.882
had been dug out and the water filled back in and 
gave a nice place to swim. And away from everybody

30:12.583 --> 30:19.872
where you weren't hassled for drinking beer and 
browsing. Did male and female ever go out there?

30:22.416 --> 30:23.597
Oh, yeah. Did they wear bathing suits, or was there 
sometimes skinny dipping? Well, I never did see a

30:30.122 --> 30:31.984
girl skinny dipping. I would have remembered 
that. I never did see girls, I'm sure. And I didn't

30:37.210 --> 30:38.612
myself. I wore swimsuits and plate bits. Smoking. 
What were people smoking? Tobacco. What kind of,

30:45.800 --> 30:47.102
what labels? Oh. Bell Mel. And the old 
traditionals never were big. Camels and Lucky

30:58.953 --> 31:04.480
Stripes and so forth were never big use things. It 
was usually the lighter tobaccos that were

31:04.580 --> 31:09.687
important. And the one name comes to mind, I guess 
it's because that's what I smoked. And do you

31:14.713 --> 31:19.299
remember anybody chewing or dipping snuff? Few 
people dipped snuff, not much chewing. Nobody

31:22.403 --> 31:24.146
smoked a pipe. None of the students.

31:28.031 --> 31:29.814
Not people that I was familiar with. Did you all 
even know the word marijuana? Marijuana, that's

31:32.699 --> 31:34.541
interesting. Marijuana was not illegal. And 
marijuana was not something anyone who is anybody

31:38.227 --> 31:42.994
would
