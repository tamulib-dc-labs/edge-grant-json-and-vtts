00:02.056 --> 00:02.356
Me? Yes. Monterrey. Monterrey in the city? Yes.

00:12.607 --> 00:17.432
In what year? I don't

00:17.452 --> 00:21.476
know. It was 1897.

00:30.541 --> 00:33.244
Yes, I have it, but I don't remember. Yes, and what 
year did you come to the United States? What year?

00:43.836 --> 00:44.136
Yes. Well, here in this place we came in 1921, about 
half a year ago, as they say, to speak Spanish. Yes.

00:59.373 --> 01:00.394
No, my husband was older. What? No. He was 16, 
wasn't

01:02.706 --> 01:08.475

01:16.627 --> 01:19.151
Well, tell me a little about your mother and 
father. What is your father's name? His name is

01:20.793 --> 01:24.078
Martín. Martín Cancha. Yes. And his mother, 
Micaela. Yes, she was a very, very kind woman with a

01:29.553 --> 01:42.109
very, very big heart, with a lot of friendship and 
love for everyone. I remember her very well. She

01:44.172 --> 01:46.855
was a very charming person. And how many children 
did she

01:46.975 --> 01:56.007
have? How many children did Micaela have? We have 
five. Three men and two women. And you

02:07.205 --> 02:14.072
live in Monterrey? And you lived in Monterrey 
during these last years? Well, I didn't know

02:21.079 --> 02:24.182
Monterrey. I was very young. My parents came here, 
near Rio Grande, to the other side of Mexico. Ah,

02:31.012 --> 02:31.893
yes. In Nuevo León. Yes? In what town? Well, in 
Nuevo León, but in Tamaulipas, where we came from.

02:39.944 --> 02:41.786
I came here to live there.

02:44.810 --> 02:47.073
I don't know anything about Tamaulipas. No? I was 
born there, but I don't know anything. Because I

02:51.178 --> 02:52.340
was very young. My parents came here to live in the 
river, to use the word. Yes. In Tamaulipas. I grew

03:00.050 --> 03:00.951
up there.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.105
Y todos nacieron en México, los hermanos, 
¿verdad? Sí. ¿Y qué clase de trabajo tenía su papá?

03:14.376 --> 03:19.705
Él trabajaba en la agricultura, en la labor. Sí. Él 
trajo de... ¿Contieres propios? ¿Contieres de

03:23.752 --> 03:29.141
suyo o de otra persona? De otras personas. Well, 
she went to the

03:30.766 --> 03:59.473
center.

04:00.432 --> 04:04.419
Do you want some coffee? Do you want a cup of coffee? 
A cup of coffee? Yes, it's here. Oh, do you already

04:13.155 --> 04:16.041
have coffee? Yes, I don't have it right now, it's 
for you. I'll just have a little drink, it's a lot.

04:33.271 --> 04:39.500
Put it on the table,

04:33.271 --> 04:39.500
please. Yes. Well, tell me, perhaps, please, a few 
things about your childhood. Did you go to school?

04:50.595 --> 04:53.519
Very little. Very little. I didn't go to school 
because it hurt me. I lost an eye since I was a baby. I

05:04.377 --> 05:07.401
had a bad eye. It hasn't been long since I lost it 
here on this ranch. What's the name of that ranch?

05:15.591 --> 05:16.312
What? The ranch, what's it called? Here? No, no, in 
Mexico, in Nuevo León. Oh, it didn't have a name,

05:21.960 --> 05:23.962
Rancho Chiquito. Rancho Chiquito? I mean, it 
didn't have a name. The village was close to the

05:29.549 --> 05:32.492
town. There was a little house there. But it wasn't 
a big ranch that had names. But it was close to what

05:39.700 --> 05:43.825
town? It was a town called General Treviño. 
General Treviño, this town. It was close to this

05:49.531 --> 05:52.374
town. And did you also work with your father? I was 
very young. I hardly worked. I was very young at

06:00.042 --> 06:03.466
that time. He died in 1911. He died very late. Did 
his father die there in Monterrey? He died there

06:13.976 --> 06:19.602
because he went to purify himself there and his 
people stayed there, where he was from. They lived

06:20.043 --> 06:23.306
here in the town of Treviño. He got very sick and 
went to purify himself there. She died here in

06:29.388 --> 06:33.472
Monterrey.

06:33.492 --> 06:33.893
Yes. And he never came to the United States. Huh? He 
never came to the United States. Your father. Oh,

06:40.840 --> 06:42.221
no. No. He died there in Mexico. He didn't. Yes. But 
your mother? She died here. Here? Yes. Here in

06:53.213 --> 06:53.754
Robestown. Well, not here, but... Robestown had 
some relatives, daughters of a sister of mine. She

07:02.302 --> 07:07.607
got a little sick and she took her father to the 
hospital. Then Robestown died. After her father

07:10.290 --> 07:17.558
died, what does her mother do with five children? 
She works in the houses with the ladies. They had a

07:23.287 --> 07:32.739
little bit of money, they gave them a little bit of 
work, they gave them a little bit of money. Yes. And

07:33.080 --> 07:35.603
in the ranch, or where? No, in the town. In the town 
in Mexico. Yes. Yes. And then, in what year did your

07:43.373 --> 07:49.982
family come here to Texas? I think it was the 16th. 
In the year 16. For what reason did you come to your

07:53.715 --> 08:03.470
family to

07:53.715 --> 08:03.470
Texas?

08:05.132 --> 08:09.278
To work a little to earn some food.

08:13.365 --> 08:13.845
Yes. Was the work better here or not? What? Was the 
work better here? Yes. There

08:22.703 --> 08:27.690
is more work here than... Yes. In what way do you 
understand that there is good work

08:28.551 --> 08:39.465
here? We work in labor. Yes. Well,

08:41.768 --> 08:49.459
wasn't it for the reason of the revolution? 
Revolution of... Is it here? No, it's already in

08:53.642 --> 08:55.385
Mexico. In these years there is a revolution, 
right? Oh, yes. I remember it was already a little

09:02.756 --> 09:09.386
big. Yes. The revolution came in 2010, 2014. Yes. 
When there was a lot of revolution in Mexico in

09:14.914 --> 09:18.500
those years. Ah. Tell me about the revolution, 
please. No, I can't tell you because I was very

09:23.798 --> 09:27.783
young. Yes. It didn't stay in my mind. Yes, but what 
does your mother say about these things?

09:37.276 --> 09:39.259
I can't tell you what she said. No? I don't 
remember. No?

09:48.260 --> 09:50.602
¿Estaba un problema en su pueblo? ¿Hay soldados o 
otras cosas como esto? Venían soldados así nomás,

09:55.007 --> 10:01.653
eran pueblos chiquitos, nomás andaban así en los 
pueblos ellos. Sí. Venían de los pueblos grandes

10:03.475 --> 10:06.999
de México.

10:13.886 --> 10:14.166
Bueno. When you came to the United States, what 
kind of work was there for your mother? She only

10:25.866 --> 10:28.549
worked at home. She didn't work here. Only at home. 
And you? We worked in the lab.

10:41.661 --> 10:44.203
Here in Robstown or somewhere else? Here in this 
place, because we've been here all the time since

10:45.213 --> 10:58.526
we came from Mexico.

10:58.747 --> 10:58.907
Yes. Do

10:58.927 --> 11:09.097

10:58.927 --> 11:09.097
more coffee? No. No? No. And

11:15.267 --> 11:27.900
did you visit Mexico after you left? Do you know 
Mexico in these past years? When I was there, I

11:32.304 --> 11:35.107
didn't want to go back. When we came here, I didn't 
want to go back.

11:41.433 --> 11:41.754
No, never? And were you married? No. No, never? I 
never got married. I never got married. And

11:52.074 --> 11:57.920

house did you have? Tell me about your house in

12:37.181 --> 12:43.168
Mexico. Oh, no. to the poor, not a good

12:44.637 --> 12:52.670
big house. And it was made

12:52.790 --> 12:59.040
of what kind of material? Material, a material 
that in Mexico is that they take out of the sky some

12:59.060 --> 13:06.992
stones that they call, what do they call it? Yes. 
Yes, some blocks that they take out, they compose

13:07.272 --> 13:11.539
them. They take them out of the land and put them

13:13.780 --> 13:27.733
in

13:13.780 --> 13:27.733
houses. Was life very different there? Was life 
very different there? Oh, yes. Yes? In what way?

13:38.803 --> 13:41.225
There wasn't much work. No? For the people. Poor 
people. There was work, but...

13:49.429 --> 14:00.103
They liked to come back here, to this

13:49.429 --> 14:00.103
side. Yes. And what do you pay in Mexico? A lot of 
money or little? In those days they paid a little.

14:08.534 --> 14:10.117
Now they pay more. According to what people say.
