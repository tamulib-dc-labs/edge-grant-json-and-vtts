WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:11.028
July 21st, I believe, and we're in a very beautiful setting at Lancaster Place, you call this?

00:11.729 --> 00:13.832
Yeah, I guess.

00:13.852 --> 00:19.499
And getting ready to ask Bill Lancaster to recall his memories of being here.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.903
Now, Bill, use your mic and let's see if it's working.

00:23.063 --> 00:25.326
Hello, can you, is it working okay?

00:26.027 --> 00:29.572
All right.

00:29.592 --> 00:29.692
Okay.

00:29.712 --> 00:32.215
When did your family first get to College Station?

00:32.752 --> 00:38.199
My father came down here as a single person in 1920 from Fort Collins.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.982
He was in the Extension Service.

00:42.944 --> 00:45.527
Now, he didn't start out at Fort Collins.

00:45.607 --> 00:55.479
He entered the University of Missouri, by the way, in about 1912, after a year or two, transferred to Kansas State.

00:57.141 --> 01:01.847
And I guess it was in the agriculture, if it was

01:02.401 --> 01:08.829
If it was definitive enough back then, it would have been agronomy, but I suspect it was a general agricultural degree.

01:10.591 --> 01:12.353
He went into the extension service.

01:13.715 --> 01:16.559
He wanted a military career is what he wanted.

01:16.799 --> 01:28.233
He was the cadet colonel at Kansas State after he'd been in the military, but he didn't get that just before World War I and went into the extension service.

01:29.535 --> 01:31.918
First was in Idaho.

01:32.303 --> 01:39.112
and then to Fort Collins where my mother was also in the Ag Extension Service.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.915
But he came down here in 1920.

01:41.516 --> 01:52.130
They were married in 1921 and got involved in the development of this area here.

01:52.331 --> 01:53.432
I'm not sure how.

01:53.532 --> 01:59.541
He had no money and I have no idea how in the world he got involved in development with Dr. F.B.

01:59.581 --> 02:00.522
Clark.

02:00.822 --> 02:02.384
who lived next door here.

02:02.464 --> 02:08.730
About when did they start the development of this bit of real estate?

02:08.850 --> 02:11.373
Oh, it was 20 or 21.

02:11.593 --> 02:12.274
Oh, really?

02:12.654 --> 02:15.918
Yeah, I had one of the original plats with a date on it.

02:17.159 --> 02:27.049
As a matter of fact, my mother and father built the first house in this area, which would have been the first house off the campus at the time.

02:27.569 --> 02:37.204
the house, not this house, but a house that was on this lot and the house next door which was ultimately occupied by Pink Downs.

02:38.165 --> 02:51.366
Those two houses were built at the same time in the spring of 22 and by Clarence Andrews and Brian and the

02:52.122 --> 02:57.108
Park area, College Park as it's called, began with that development.

02:57.168 --> 03:05.197
Other houses, by 1929 or 30, there were probably 25 or 30 houses down here in this area.

03:05.497 --> 03:08.661
As far as you know, was it a wooded area?

03:09.141 --> 03:10.102
Oh yes, yes.

03:10.883 --> 03:21.235
This is described in an article in the Dallas News, 1926 article, as a mosquito infested, rat infested,

03:21.417 --> 03:31.706
boondoggle place, and why would anybody want to go down there in the first place off the campus, but there was a lake.

03:32.267 --> 03:40.815
They dredged all this out and made a lake down here and had Fritz Hensel, F.W.

03:40.835 --> 03:50.243
Hensel Sr., who was the college landscape architect at the time, laid the thing out, the streets and

03:50.678 --> 04:00.874
was involved in, well there wasn't any landscaping development but I guess the clearing if you have it that way and laying out of the streets and what not.

04:01.327 --> 04:12.902
But the general appearance improved, but it's interesting to note that in that article it was not very complimentary of the land in the first place, but it did improve.

04:13.122 --> 04:20.252
Now, as far as I'm aware, most of the professional employees, be the faculty or staff, lived on campus.

04:20.292 --> 04:21.974
Yes, yes.

04:22.294 --> 04:30.625
Did you ever hear from your family whether anybody in any position of authority on the campus frowned on someone living off?

04:30.605 --> 04:32.287
Was it okay to live off campus?

04:33.968 --> 04:34.349
Yes.

04:34.809 --> 04:40.875
As far as I know, the housing was very, very tight.

04:42.637 --> 04:49.723
I think probably by 1930, I think the last house was built on campus in 1930.

04:50.084 --> 04:56.730
None had been built before that time, probably World War I type.

04:57.132 --> 05:03.041
campus was crowded and I think just by guessing I'd say they welcomed this.

05:03.402 --> 05:08.069
So that a newcomer might not be able to find a place on campus.

05:08.089 --> 05:24.996
Oh definitely not as a matter of fact it was we're talking department heads and deans and whatnot and now some of the maintenance people had their area which was over near the power plant the current power plant in that area

05:25.668 --> 05:41.455
They had their houses, but as far as the main area, which is in the block now occupied by the Memorial Student Center, we're talking about deans and department heads and whatnot, and there just wasn't any other housing available.

05:42.336 --> 05:47.645
And I presume, were there any houses that were kind of designated for deans?

05:48.126 --> 05:50.009
Was there a priority?

05:50.971 --> 05:51.692
Yes.

05:51.993 --> 06:01.275
Now, a friend of mine, Knox Walker, who lived on the campus, has a lot of that lined out and you'll want to talk with him.

06:01.335 --> 06:05.424
And yes, there was definitely a priority on it.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.073
Somebody, I can't think now.

06:10.032 --> 06:12.456
talked about the house that he was assigned.

06:12.516 --> 06:16.802
It was just a terrible place and that's why Hila in the world was that.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.445
I can't remember now who it was.

06:18.605 --> 06:21.289
Was there housing at Northgate then at all?

06:21.750 --> 06:24.775
Not much, no.

06:24.815 --> 06:27.659
There was the apartment building.

06:27.679 --> 06:32.427
I don't know who's in it now.

06:32.467 --> 06:35.972
There's an eating establishment in it now near the campus theater.

06:36.340 --> 06:47.639
It was there and there was an apartment and there were a few farmhouses north of that, but essentially there was not faculty housing at the north gate.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.945
And the highway was then what we now call the Welburn Road.

06:50.965 --> 06:51.666
Yes, yes.

06:52.067 --> 06:59.239
And so that over where Texas Avenue is and what some of us used to call East Gate, that didn't exist.

06:59.359 --> 07:00.441
No, no.

07:00.556 --> 07:02.759
That was just, I presume, pasture land.

07:03.100 --> 07:03.420
Yes.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.423
If even used for pastures.

07:05.443 --> 07:06.444
Yes, yes.

07:07.025 --> 07:09.849
Highway 6 came in early 30s.

07:10.350 --> 07:16.238
And, of course, the university turned around at that point and faced east instead of west.

07:16.318 --> 07:16.498
Right.

07:16.518 --> 07:19.682
So you grew up on this piece of real estate.

07:19.763 --> 07:19.983
Yes.

07:20.003 --> 07:21.585
I was born here.

07:21.565 --> 07:25.671
And another house that was here is down the street now at 505.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.755
Literally, were you born?

07:29.176 --> 07:33.702
Three out of the five of us were born at home.

07:34.764 --> 07:36.606
Did the doctor come to the house?

07:36.626 --> 07:37.307
Yes, Dr. J.E.

07:37.367 --> 07:40.171
Marsh, who's the father of the J.E.

07:40.211 --> 07:42.274
Marsh practicing in Bryan now.

07:42.811 --> 07:46.955
was the college physician, and he attended the birth.

07:47.316 --> 07:54.523
Our two older brothers and sisters were born in Bryan, an older brother and an older sister, born in St.

07:54.543 --> 07:58.647
Joseph Hospital in Bryan, but the three younger ones were born at home.

07:58.947 --> 08:06.175
I believe Jim Cashin told me that he was born on campus at Dr. Marsh, and Dr. Marsh lived on campus?

08:06.195 --> 08:07.536
Yes, yes.

08:07.516 --> 08:15.834
Now, there was no facility for overnight hospital care on the campus or anything, was there?

08:16.375 --> 08:18.820
Well, there were rooms in the hospital, yes.

08:19.181 --> 08:19.502
Were there?

08:19.562 --> 08:20.564
Yes, uh-huh.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.286
Okay.

08:21.306 --> 08:24.613
Now, how many or what, but yes, there were,

08:25.015 --> 08:30.965
But the time I have a recollection of it, there were hospital beds, yes, there in that hospital.

08:31.526 --> 08:42.023
All right, describe for me then growing up in this, where were playmates and school and so forth?

08:42.043 --> 08:45.268
Well, I was born in 28, which was,

08:45.755 --> 08:49.359
you know, eight years after this thing all began.

08:49.479 --> 08:56.427
So there were houses here and our lives pretty well centered on the lake down here.

08:56.527 --> 09:01.853
We built rafts and fishing whatever there was.

09:01.953 --> 09:07.680
In fact, some of my mother's sterling silver is at the bottom of that lake.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.463
I've tried to since find it since it was drained.

09:11.050 --> 09:20.644
We'd go out on the raft and have a picnic or something but one time there was a disaster when we lost some of my mother's good stuff.

09:21.986 --> 09:32.522
Of course we went on the campus, a lot of the social life was centered on the campus as you might well know.

09:32.622 --> 09:38.070
The YMCA was the center of everything.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.964
Well, before the MSC came along, everything happened.

09:41.984 --> 09:44.728
There was even a swimming pool in the YMCA.

09:44.768 --> 09:48.993
There was a swimming pool built later, the P.L.

09:49.034 --> 09:51.537
Downs Natatorium, which was built in 1932.

09:52.919 --> 09:56.343
Summertime, we just spent all our time there.

09:56.444 --> 10:02.672
I mean, for $3, the family could spend every day of the summer up there, you know.

10:02.732 --> 10:07.078
But we...

10:08.324 --> 10:13.356
Whatever kids did back then, we did here.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.703
You began first grade where?

10:17.544 --> 10:18.265
On campus.

10:18.565 --> 10:20.006
Where was the school?

10:20.527 --> 10:23.510
It was the east end of Joe Rout Boulevard.

10:23.550 --> 10:30.276
There was a building, a stucco building there, which had been built in 1920 or 21.

10:33.399 --> 10:38.624
The university provided that, I think, as a wing of their education department.

10:38.664 --> 10:42.347
It was under the tutelage somehow of the education department.

10:42.867 --> 10:53.052
and I guess got some state funding, but that was the whole school for the college station system.

10:54.295 --> 10:55.999
By the time I got there,

10:56.671 --> 11:11.130
I entered school in 34 in the first grade, and the university had given the school system Pfeiffer Hall, which just before being torn down and demolished, it should have been.

11:11.150 --> 11:21.683
In fact, the kids almost demolished it themselves, but that was the high school by the time I entered first grade in 1934.

11:21.663 --> 11:23.006
I never reached there.

11:23.126 --> 11:33.669
Now, we moved off campus in Christmas of 39, and I was in the seventh grade then when we went to the area over here.

11:33.690 --> 11:37.137
In the first grade, who were your fellow students?

11:37.177 --> 11:39.823
Were they all A&M related?

11:39.955 --> 11:45.487
Yes, or this of course was the consolidated school system.

11:45.647 --> 11:47.070
Now we brought in students.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.373
So there were country kids.

11:48.393 --> 11:49.716
Oh yes, yes indeed.

11:50.337 --> 11:58.875
Now somehow Welburn had grades one through three and they didn't join us until the fourth grade.

11:59.193 --> 12:09.068
There were other Union Hill, Rock Prairie, places of that nature that were imported, I guess, from the first grade on.

12:09.128 --> 12:16.980
But I can remember some of these kids, non-college associated people in the first grade with me.

12:17.060 --> 12:19.945
But Knox Walker was one.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.669
I mentioned his name a while ago.

12:23.746 --> 12:25.028
E.L.

12:25.068 --> 12:29.473
Williams' son, who used to be head of the Industrial Education Department.

12:32.257 --> 12:47.256
Rattan, Tommy Rattan, there was a girl by the name of Lillian Hornick whose father, they were Czechoslovakian, and he ran a uniform place at the North Gate.

12:47.742 --> 13:02.688
Now, Henry Gilchrist told me that when the Gilchrist moved over here in 37, that his father gave him a bicycle as a kind of a bribe to make him accept the move because they had a new house in Austin.

13:02.708 --> 13:08.398
They'd only been in about a year, and when they came over here, he and his mother thought they'd gone to the wilderness.

13:08.738 --> 13:09.319
They had.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.944
And he said that...

13:13.038 --> 13:14.741
His father, he called it speedometer.

13:15.102 --> 13:22.015
He had a speedometer on the bike and he said he put 900 miles on it the first three months because he said he rode that bike everywhere.

13:23.157 --> 13:24.880
I think I remember that bicycle.

13:25.481 --> 13:30.250
Now you know they built, I say the last house was built on campus in 1930.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.835
They built a house for Mr. Gilchrist.

13:33.305 --> 13:37.951
in 37, which is the, now they call it the chancellor's home.

13:37.971 --> 13:39.153
That white frame house?

13:39.393 --> 13:41.997
No, no, no, it's where Male and Southern are living.

13:42.017 --> 13:44.140
That's what I mean, yeah, that white frame house.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.123
It's brick, oh yeah, white brick.

13:46.263 --> 13:46.643
Oh, okay.

13:47.645 --> 13:52.231
They built that in 37 for Mr. Gilchrist as dean of engineering.

13:53.373 --> 13:58.820
Now, if they lived somewhere else before that was ready, I'm not aware of it.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.265
They could have temporarily lived somewhere else.

14:02.667 --> 14:07.533
That should have been the place that Henry remembered because it was a nice place.

14:08.054 --> 14:14.462
Your classmates then, there were some farm kids and some campus.

14:14.843 --> 14:15.984
Oh yes, definitely.

14:16.004 --> 14:17.987
Do you remember how many were in the first grade?

14:18.948 --> 14:20.230
Was it one room or two?

14:20.250 --> 14:21.291
Oh no, it was one room.

14:22.833 --> 14:28.000
It was a large room on the first floor of this building.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.800
There were 29 of us who graduated.

14:31.820 --> 14:34.223
I remember that in 1945, 11 years.

14:34.243 --> 14:36.366
Oh, that's a good benchmark.

14:36.606 --> 14:37.667
11 years later.

14:38.428 --> 14:45.657
Now, we were a small class because there were classes both ahead of us and behind us that had in the 30s.

14:46.317 --> 14:49.862
And why ours was so small, I have no earthly idea.

14:49.962 --> 14:56.890
But it was later divided as we moved up.

14:57.713 --> 15:03.443
Let's see, in the fourth grade, let's see, we were together.

15:03.483 --> 15:04.906
Fourth grade was split.

15:05.086 --> 15:06.709
Fifth grade we were together.

15:07.530 --> 15:09.353
The sixth grade we were split.

15:10.215 --> 15:13.360
So it must have enlarged by that time.

15:13.481 --> 15:14.983
I can't imagine them splitting.

15:15.003 --> 15:19.992
Now the teachers, were most of the teachers faculty wives?

15:20.731 --> 15:26.658
Yes, except the first grade teacher was Mrs. Sloop, Mrs. Fred L. Sloop.

15:27.399 --> 15:28.340
How do you spell them?

15:28.360 --> 15:29.121
Sloop.

15:29.141 --> 15:29.662
S-L-O-O-P.

15:30.082 --> 15:39.453
Now she is well known or was in the educational circles and I expect still is as a phonetics expert.

15:39.794 --> 15:40.775
She has books.

15:40.855 --> 15:44.359
She's written books on it and I know for years

15:44.896 --> 15:54.033
the Sloop method was used in the phonetic, you may be familiar with it or may have heard of it, but that was Mrs. Sloop and that was a very wonderful teacher.

15:54.113 --> 16:00.504
Were there some other unforgettable teachers that you can easily recall?

16:00.564 --> 16:04.812
Really, the teachers I remember were all

16:05.315 --> 16:20.113
Good teachers, Mrs. Holzman, who died at 102 not long ago here, was the third grade teacher and had been there for, well, goodness knows how long, but she was a lovable person.

16:20.193 --> 16:27.362
My second grade teacher was a Mrs. Sims, who I don't believe was here long, but she was somebody that we all liked.

16:28.223 --> 16:34.410
Mrs. Heaton, Homer Heaton's wife, was our sixth grade teacher.

16:34.930 --> 16:37.973
She was a very pleasant person.

16:38.073 --> 16:39.535
She was more stern.

16:39.595 --> 16:44.681
She was a sterner person than what we'd been used to, but a good teacher.

16:44.721 --> 16:47.664
No, I don't recall.

16:52.068 --> 16:56.093
Really, I can remember my brothers and sisters talking about some high school teachers.

16:56.313 --> 17:02.760
Alfred Chalk's wife was a good teacher, but I think very, very firm.

17:03.061 --> 17:05.764
Ethel Burgess was an English teacher.

17:06.745 --> 17:13.832
You know, she was the president's daughter and was a very lovable, you know, teacher.

17:14.272 --> 17:23.762
And really I don't, I think we were very fortunate probably in having good quality teachers at the time.

17:24.663 --> 17:27.786
And in those elementary years particularly,

17:28.205 --> 17:35.818
Did it seem to matter at school or on the playground what role your father played at A&M?

17:37.401 --> 17:38.183
Not really.

17:38.363 --> 17:39.665
I wasn't aware of it.

17:39.705 --> 17:47.479
Now, I think the kids from off campus felt displaced a little bit, but I think

17:48.337 --> 17:58.215
Some of my later on better friends were kids whose parents were not associated with the university, country kids as we called them back then.

17:59.296 --> 18:06.970
But I think they felt probably, I don't know what a good word would be,

18:07.557 --> 18:11.180
I don't think it was a deserved placing.

18:11.281 --> 18:15.044
I think we took them in just like everybody else.

18:15.084 --> 18:22.711
If that was our privilege, it's probably a presumption on my part to say that, but I think we all got along real fine.

18:22.812 --> 18:34.763
Were there, in your family, were there any rules that your parents gave you about going to and from school, things you were not to do, places you were not to go?

18:36.599 --> 18:37.440
place to go.

18:38.902 --> 18:41.025
No, you just got there and got back.

18:41.305 --> 18:44.489
Were you expected to come straight home and change clothes and then?

18:44.749 --> 18:46.752
Yes, yes, yes.

18:48.474 --> 18:50.957
If we went somewhere, we had to get permission.

18:50.997 --> 18:59.788
A friend of mine was, my father was an extension service and his father was an extension service and they lived at the North Gate.

19:00.477 --> 19:05.663
And if I went to his house, I'd have to get permission, or if he came down here, we did.

19:06.323 --> 19:14.852
Incidentally, my father was on the third floor of the Extension Service building, which is now the Trigon, as you know it.

19:15.994 --> 19:19.818
There was one telephone up there on that floor.

19:20.819 --> 19:27.666
And one of the most impressive things about my friends, his father was the vice director down on the first floor.

19:28.422 --> 19:34.682
One of the most impressive things in that office was the fact that he had a telephone on his desk.

19:35.444 --> 19:41.824
It was not only just a telephone, it was what we called a French phone, a cradle-type phone, no dial, of course.

19:42.260 --> 19:45.563
But that to me was, you know, very impressionable.

19:45.884 --> 19:54.672
You know, here my father was a professional person, but, you know, the telephone was across the hall in a janitorial closet over there.

19:55.193 --> 20:01.779
And if it rang, somebody would go answer it and yell to whoever it was for.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.962
Do you remember when your family got their first telephone?

20:06.844 --> 20:08.265
We always had one.

20:08.626 --> 20:09.146
Did you?

20:09.807 --> 20:09.887
Yes.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.185
No, it was before my time.

20:12.285 --> 20:18.213
I can remember when we first got a cradle phone, you know, that's what you call it, a French phone or what have you.

20:18.814 --> 20:21.557
The other one, of course, was the candlestick phone.

20:21.577 --> 20:23.119
And the number please.

20:23.540 --> 20:24.100
That's right.

20:24.241 --> 20:25.482
Party line and so forth.

20:25.602 --> 20:27.925
That's exactly right, yes sir.

20:28.326 --> 20:35.335
Let's see, were there any, what about you youngsters,

20:35.315 --> 20:45.994
dabbling around in the dormitories, did you, little boys and girls, ever do anything on campus?

20:46.595 --> 20:47.857
Not in the dorms.

20:48.117 --> 20:50.742
Now what would happen at the end of the year

20:51.380 --> 21:13.540
the students would clean out their stuff and throw it out on them and we'd love to go through oh you have all kinds of fountain pens and pencils and alarm clocks and all sorts of things that interested us that were even then during the depression period I look back and I'm amazed at some of the things that were thrown away

21:14.262 --> 21:22.517
But, and then there was a big trash box behind the exchange store building which is now Heaton Hall.

21:22.637 --> 21:32.215
But, and we'd, they'd throw out some remarkable things sometimes and we'd crawl up into that box and rummage through that sometime.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.743
But, now we'd go through the steam tunnels

21:37.718 --> 21:40.401
which, you know, weren't supposed to do.

21:40.641 --> 21:43.003
We got older, you know, as little kids.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.485
We did them in high school.

21:44.585 --> 21:49.490
We'd rummage around in the steam tunnels, and what worse the Aggies did too.

21:50.511 --> 21:52.633
We'd get on top of the academic building.

21:52.653 --> 21:56.217
Of course, it was accessible.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.020
Sometimes they would lock.

21:59.100 --> 22:06.207
There was a cage on the fourth floor that would keep you from getting up there, but when it was unlocked, which was quite often,

22:06.642 --> 22:12.169
We'd get on top of the academic building and, you know, it was just a good place to go and see things.

22:12.990 --> 22:26.065
Now, I've heard President Rutter talk about Prexy's Moon and that supposedly, if I remember correctly, that it was considered a real cool thing if you were a cadet to try to shoot out that light bulb.

22:26.165 --> 22:26.686
Indeed.

22:26.726 --> 22:27.267
Is that right?

22:27.307 --> 22:28.028
Yes, indeed.

22:28.068 --> 22:32.613
That was on top of the dome of the academic building.

22:32.633 --> 22:33.234
That's right.

22:33.254 --> 22:35.957
And I presume then there must have been some holes

22:36.308 --> 22:39.211
in that dome, maybe, where somebody had missed?

22:39.831 --> 22:41.333
Bound to be, however.

22:41.453 --> 22:43.435
I never did it myself.

22:43.875 --> 22:49.520
I did climb to the top of the water tower one time, which was quite a daring thing.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.041
How old were you then, do you know?

22:51.061 --> 22:52.263
Well, we were high school.

22:52.283 --> 23:00.190
I was probably a junior in high school or something, but three boys and a girl climbed up there.

23:00.210 --> 23:03.733
Now, I didn't go beyond the railing that went around it.

23:04.102 --> 23:07.266
And my sister went to the very top one time.

23:07.626 --> 23:10.509
I wasn't with her, but I wasn't that daring.

23:10.549 --> 23:12.251
That was pretty precarious.

23:12.411 --> 23:15.835
Did the whistle blow in all those years?

23:15.915 --> 23:16.656
Yes, sir.

23:17.117 --> 23:19.119
Jack Williams did away with that.

23:19.299 --> 23:21.982
Eight, twelve, one and five?

23:22.062 --> 23:22.483
Yes, sir.

23:23.324 --> 23:28.810
He said it sounded too much like a prison or an institution or something.

23:29.313 --> 23:30.414
Oh, yes, indeed.

23:30.514 --> 23:34.839
Then they used that many years ago as the fire whistle.

23:34.879 --> 23:35.760
Right, that I remember.

23:35.780 --> 23:38.083
That woo, woo, woo, woo, that was weird.

23:38.163 --> 23:39.624
You heard that in the middle of the night.

23:39.684 --> 23:42.527
It would scare the living daylights out of you.

23:42.547 --> 23:45.310
They got a siren later that sounded better.

23:45.771 --> 23:56.102
Were there any places of entertainment anywhere within close proximity to the campus that you youngsters were not supposed to visit?

23:56.663 --> 23:57.784
Oh, I don't think.

23:58.338 --> 23:59.620
May have been there.

23:59.700 --> 24:00.742
I never heard about them.

24:00.922 --> 24:06.512
Uncle Ed's is out here on the highway.

24:06.672 --> 24:08.455
Students went there to drink beer.

24:09.096 --> 24:10.438
Describe Uncle Ed's.

24:12.081 --> 24:17.410
Well, actually the property, to go back a little bit,

24:17.845 --> 24:26.739
the five men who developed College Park bought these 85 acres from Ed Hardlicka and his sister, Mrs. Schwartz.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.924
So they owned quite a bit of land here.

24:30.866 --> 24:35.513
But Uncle Ed's was just a wooden spot.

24:35.613 --> 24:38.638
I guess it had a wooden floor to it.

24:39.175 --> 24:40.477
Pretty much of a joint.

24:40.717 --> 24:42.420
It was on Welborn Road.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.382
Yeah, Welborn Road.

24:43.462 --> 24:45.024
Right far down the way.

24:45.085 --> 24:46.968
Near Luther Street.

24:47.368 --> 24:56.984
In fact, the Hardlicker house, their home was at the intersection of Welborn Road and Luther Street facing west.

24:57.585 --> 25:03.114
And then next to it and closer to the road, the house was set back a little bit.

25:03.134 --> 25:05.858
But closer to the road was this

25:06.749 --> 25:13.537
I guess it was a filling station, gas, you know, a few little groceries.

25:13.557 --> 25:16.661
How many people could be seated at one time?

25:16.761 --> 25:24.430
Oh, I wouldn't think more than 50 or so at the most, at the most.

25:24.450 --> 25:29.095
Did he serve hamburgers, barbecue with their food?

25:30.138 --> 25:30.879
I think he did.

25:30.899 --> 25:34.245
I must, I'll have to admit, I don't think I was ever in there.

25:34.566 --> 25:37.832
And it was beer, not whiskey.

25:37.852 --> 25:38.273
Beer, yeah.

25:38.313 --> 25:41.739
Now Brazos County was what they called damp at the time.

25:41.819 --> 25:46.307
It was served beer, but not whiskey.

25:46.574 --> 25:53.925
Now, were A&M students, was it okay for them to go there?

25:54.526 --> 25:55.107
They went.

25:56.168 --> 25:57.791
Okay, I don't know.

25:57.811 --> 26:00.675
I don't think I've heard of any rule which prohibited it.

26:01.717 --> 26:04.100
And there was nothing else.

26:05.983 --> 26:07.065
There was nothing else.

26:07.105 --> 26:12.733
Now, Bryan, of course, had some places, but I don't remember...

26:14.435 --> 26:33.338
Anything in particular that would attract A&M students, it might have been the fact that I just wasn't old enough to have heard about it, but even later, I don't remember, Brian had his joints, his beer joints and things.

26:33.908 --> 26:39.659
I don't recall any one of them that was frequented by biennium students.

26:39.719 --> 26:43.546
I've not heard much about that either, that that was so far away.

26:43.586 --> 26:44.468
Yeah.

26:44.488 --> 26:45.590
And they didn't have wheels.

26:46.111 --> 26:46.792
That's right.

26:46.972 --> 26:53.044
Now, would the students sometimes walk to hard lickers?

26:53.645 --> 26:54.186
Oh, yeah.

26:54.366 --> 26:56.490
Yeah, that's the only way to get there, really.

26:56.943 --> 27:01.347
No, the student cars on campus, I expect you could count with one hand.

27:01.367 --> 27:02.768
That's what I thought, that was very few.

27:02.988 --> 27:03.329
Yeah.

27:04.690 --> 27:20.304
As you look back on those elementary and junior, senior high years, I know that wasn't divided into junior, senior high then, how would you summarize the quality of the A&M Consolidated School that you attended?

27:20.324 --> 27:24.908
Of course, it's the only school I ever attended, so I,

27:25.664 --> 27:31.877
Looking back, I would think it was probably pretty good, thinking of the quality of the teachers that we had.

27:31.937 --> 27:41.496
Now, whether, you know, I have no idea how it ranked among, you know, the state standards and whatnot, but I'm just thinking of

27:42.438 --> 27:48.247
the people who gave it direction, the school board and the superintendent, the principals.

27:49.529 --> 27:51.452
By and large, who made up the school board?

27:51.472 --> 27:52.834
Was it campus folks?

27:53.555 --> 27:53.875
Yes.

27:53.996 --> 28:09.159
Now, there was always a criteria or an agreement, I doubt if it was a written agreement, that there would always be a representative from one of the outlying, I think probably more than one, probably at least two representatives.

28:09.179 --> 28:11.382
There was always one from Welburn.

28:11.952 --> 28:22.267
And there was one from either Union Hill or Rock Prairie somewhere who I think this was an understanding that it would always be that way.

28:22.807 --> 28:25.391
The rest of them were university people.

28:27.093 --> 28:32.020
Now did you have, in high school, did you have science?

28:32.141 --> 28:33.823
Did you have chemistry, physics?

28:34.864 --> 28:38.770
No, we had a science course.

28:40.555 --> 28:42.258
Mr. Bunning taught this.

28:42.759 --> 28:52.776
I was in high school the exact war years, 41 through 45, so we were slighted, I expect, in quality of teaching.

28:52.796 --> 28:53.618
What about languages?

28:54.840 --> 28:57.845
I had Spanish, I took Spanish, nothing other than that.

28:58.546 --> 29:01.872
I think this science course was there, there was no chemistry.

29:02.830 --> 29:06.815
It was a general science, I think, was the only thing of that nature.

29:07.235 --> 29:09.898
And you said there were 29 who graduated.

29:11.781 --> 29:13.943
Were most of those college related?

29:16.466 --> 29:19.750
Yes, I think so.

29:19.770 --> 29:24.636
And as you got out of high school, what did you think you were going to do the rest of your life?

29:25.038 --> 29:34.627
Well, for me, it was just inevitable that you go to Texas A&M, you know, it was just a foregone conclusion, and I think that was the case with most of us.

29:35.648 --> 29:51.383
I find it strange in my own class, when I look like at Henry Gilchrist's class and some fore and aft, there was one PhD in our class, no MDs,

29:52.274 --> 30:00.041
I'm sure several masters, but only one PhD, no MDs at all, and I don't think any lawyers.

30:01.022 --> 30:05.786
I don't know what happened to our bunch, but you know.

30:05.867 --> 30:09.410
They had some college-degreed parents.

30:09.530 --> 30:11.792
Yes, yes, very definitely.

30:12.292 --> 30:20.560
I think in Henry's class, they had doctors, lawyers, school administrators, you know, just...

30:21.316 --> 30:31.343
And Henry was two years, three years older than I. He was in the 45, he must have been class of 42.

30:32.285 --> 30:42.217
And, but in that particular class and others, there were doctors and lawyers and whatnot, but ours just, I don't know what happened to it.

30:43.339 --> 30:46.743
You went your first grades on the campus.

30:46.763 --> 30:47.083
Yes.

30:47.204 --> 30:49.086
Then you move off campus when?

30:49.567 --> 30:53.972
We left there and when we departed school,

30:54.695 --> 31:00.361
the Christmas holidays in 1939 we took all our books and things home.

31:00.381 --> 31:18.139
I have a very vivid recollection of Mrs. Heaton inspecting all the desks and everything to make sure we took everything out and we went home and then after the holidays we reported to the new school over here on Timber Street which was oh marvelous a beautiful place.

31:18.179 --> 31:18.880
Timber and

31:19.096 --> 31:36.396
and uh uh well well yeah uh not not welburn uh jersey jersey street yeah yes uh and were all 11 grade 12 grades in the same building then no no no no in fact they were separate buildings the for uh first grade
