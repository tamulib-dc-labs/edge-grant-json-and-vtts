00:01.280 --> 00:04.163
Today's date is December 18th, 1981. This is a 
test. Testing.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.453
Testing, testing. This is a test. This is Terry 
Anderson. This is interview number two with

00:15.656 --> 00:17.839
General Ludeke. Today's date is Wednesday, 
January 27th, 1982. This is tape three.

00:32.178 --> 00:35.501
Last time, this is our second interview with 
General Ludeke. Today is the 27th of January,

00:35.662 --> 00:37.924
1982. Last time we were talking about the position 
that you had from July 43rd to February 46th, which

00:39.606 --> 00:48.014
is on page four of your . We were talking about the 
position of deputy chief of staff for operations,

00:50.017 --> 00:58.185
plans, trainings, intelligent, and 
communications. Army Air Force, Southeast Asia

00:59.279 --> 01:03.950
Command, and the China, India, Burma Theater. And 
the last thing that you talked about was your views

01:04.170 --> 01:13.130
about Chiang Kai-shek, and we covered that. And I 
was wondering about a couple of other people who

01:13.251 --> 01:17.440
are very important. One was Hap Arnold and another 
one was Mountbatten, Lord Mountbatten, and I'd

01:17.420 --> 01:27.311
like you to give your views on those two men. Did you 
ever meet them? You must have met them. Yes, I did.

01:33.958 --> 01:41.706
General Arnold was Major Arnold when I first met 
him and he was in command of March Field,

01:33.958 --> 01:41.706
California. when I went to Marshfield, first out 
of flying school, as a cadet.

01:52.671 --> 02:09.567
Everyone at Marshfield was away flying air mail at 
that, when I arrived there, so it was a case of going

01:52.671 --> 02:09.567
on to a post and not being able to call on a 
commanding officer for nearly four months

01:52.671 --> 02:09.567
because we had to get him home for, and so I met him 
when he did, was able to come home. And

02:20.199 --> 02:30.762
served under him in one capacity or another until 
1937, and then

02:33.239 --> 02:41.108
By the time I got back from Panama, he was chief of 
staff of the Air Force, Army Air Forces. And

02:41.128 --> 03:00.732
after I got out of the intelligence command, which 
was under Army, and joined back with the Air Force,

02:41.128 --> 03:00.732
well then I was under him again, but I joined back 
with the Air Force in order to go to India. This was

03:02.905 --> 03:17.063
just prior to Admiral Mountbatten's arrival in 
India to take over as Viceroy as well as Commander,

03:02.905 --> 03:17.063
Southeast Asia Command.

03:20.368 --> 03:26.736
So, and I went there at that time to be Chief of Staff 
Operations for U.S. Air Forces, CBR, in New Delhi

03:27.593 --> 03:51.367
and attended many of the conferences

03:27.593 --> 03:51.367
in planning and operations

03:27.593 --> 03:51.367
of the Southeast Asia Command under Mountbatten. 
And I got to know him very well in that capacity.

03:58.930 --> 04:20.796
Later we went to Cairo to the Sexton Conference and 
this was his first major command conference after

03:58.930 --> 04:20.796
having taken over as Supreme Commander Southeast 
Asia Command. And in Cairo I served him among

04:20.816 --> 04:26.423
others as an air planner. for many of the 
presentations and papers that were presented at,

04:27.078 --> 04:33.524
at the Sexton, uh, conference. It was a very 
interesting conference in many respects, but in

04:35.986 --> 04:53.743
our limited area

04:35.986 --> 04:53.743
that was present at the conference, uh, Admiral 
Mountbatten, the new Supreme Commander,

04:35.986 --> 04:53.743
uh, Chiang Kai-shek, who I think expected to be the 
Southeast Asia commander, and Madame Chang, of

04:55.529 --> 05:05.417
course, was with him. General Joe Stilwell, who 
was the senior American commander in India. Sir

05:12.203 --> 05:19.790
Oliver Leese, who was the senior British 
commander in India.

05:22.612 --> 05:25.114
All vying for the limited resources that the 
combined chiefs of staff might be able to make

05:25.567 --> 05:31.414
available for that theater. So it was a very 
interesting time.

05:37.241 --> 05:52.840
Back in India, after Cairo, when we returned, all 
of the air forces in India, American, British,

05:37.241 --> 05:52.840
Canadian, Australian, one New Zealand squadron, 
Indian, were all integrated into one operational

05:53.950 --> 06:05.367
force called the Southeast Asia Air Command. 
General Stratmire was made commander of that

06:07.591 --> 06:20.430
Southeast Asia Air Command,

06:07.591 --> 06:20.430
and I retained my job as deputy chief of staff 
operations, plans, training, and intelligence

06:21.322 --> 06:30.033
for that new command. And so we operated all of the 
air forces in India through that mechanism out of

06:32.055 --> 06:47.194
General Stratmire's headquarters and all of the 
operational things out of my office. This

06:49.418 --> 07:02.457
included not only all of the tactical and 
defensive air and offensive bombardment air and

06:49.418 --> 07:02.457
all, but air transport as well. And in that theater 
during the war, air transport was probably the

07:04.459 --> 07:14.734
most important single element of a military 
capability in the whole pit.

07:17.600 --> 07:23.949
at least it was the most controversial because 
everybody wanted it. One incident concerning

07:23.969 --> 07:34.864
Mountbatten,

07:23.969 --> 07:34.864
it's worth recording I think and at least in my 
notes.

07:38.989 --> 07:45.919
The Japanese at one point had penetrated India to 
the point of surrounding which was a British major

07:46.945 --> 08:05.131
base and outpost on the border between Burma and 
India,

07:46.945 --> 08:05.131
and had held it during the worst part of the monsoon 
season.

08:08.096 --> 08:15.366
We, the Air Forces, had to go in and fly out nearly 
half a million civilians

08:17.675 --> 08:27.445
and fly in food for everybody, including one corps 
of British troops who stayed inside. And, of

08:29.406 --> 08:38.595
course, it became a little urgent that somebody 
get moving to get that situation changed. Well, in

08:38.615 --> 08:47.344
an area where the rainfall is 300 inches a year, 
it's a little bit difficult.

08:49.602 --> 09:04.200
And all of the support that they got had to come by 
air, and very limited air that we had available.

09:04.220 --> 09:17.517
In any situation where ground personnel have to be 
supplied by air,

09:04.220 --> 09:17.517
you can almost write the conversations before the 
operations start. Because the man on the ground

09:18.374 --> 09:24.940
just doesn't have anything like what he needs to do 
his job. The man on the air side of that picture

09:24.960 --> 09:35.890
knows he has delivered to him ten times what he 
needs to do any job that might be presented to him.

09:35.910 --> 09:39.513
And so there's never a give. That situation just 
remains the same. The British troops we thought

09:43.917 --> 09:47.520
were so spoiled that they wouldn't carry their 
four o'clock tea.

09:54.245 --> 10:11.415
They would have us drop it at three-thirty, 
wherever they happened to be, which was true in

09:54.245 --> 10:11.415
many circumstances, although not all of them, and 
I certainly don't mean anything derogatory about

09:54.245 --> 10:11.415
the British troops, but they get spoiled, 
everybody gets spoiled. the commander up at

10:13.319 --> 10:34.264
Imphal, a corps commander, a major general in the 
British Army, was trying to get his corps ready to

10:13.319 --> 10:34.264
jump off from Imphal and push the Japanese back 
across the Irrawaddy River and start moving down

10:13.319 --> 10:34.264
through Vermont.

10:36.725 --> 10:48.483
But it didn't seem that he could ever get the 
weather, the supply situation, and everything

10:36.725 --> 10:48.483
else in a situation, in a condition that he felt 
more to push it off. Well, Mountbatten got a little

10:48.503 --> 10:52.930
upset about this. Finally flew out of his 
headquarters down in Salon and went straight into

10:52.950 --> 11:04.487
M-Fall on his airplane. see what was the matter.

11:10.642 --> 11:29.092
And he was told while he was there that the

11:10.642 --> 11:29.092
air supply just hadn't been built up enough that he 
could afford to move, and he'd just have to wait

11:10.642 --> 11:29.092
until we could build up the air supply a little bit

11:10.642 --> 11:29.092
more. Well, Mountbatten kind of hit the ceiling, 
what the hell's the matter with those air people

11:32.598 --> 11:37.122
because that wasn't the kind of story he was 
getting from them. So he got in his airplane and

11:39.004 --> 11:47.573
took off for Calcutta where we were and where the 
headquarters of the ground forces were also.

11:50.656 --> 11:58.724
Sent word to General Stratmire's headquarters 
that he wanted Strat over there at Barracore when

11:50.656 --> 11:58.724
he landed. He wanted to talk to him. And

12:02.720 --> 12:16.439
General Stratton called me on the intercom and 
told me to get my figures together on whatever I

12:02.720 --> 12:16.439
thought might be subject to the conversation and 
let's go. So I did, and I also got my supply man, a

12:18.161 --> 12:25.711
Brigadier Bastien, who was a British brigadier 
general.

12:27.454 --> 12:32.220
And we crawled in the boat and went across the Hooli 
over to Bearport. But the Admiral had already

12:34.158 --> 12:37.581
landed and was there ahead of us. So as we came into 
the Sir Oliver Lee's office area, big, pretty good

12:39.663 --> 13:03.523
sized building in there,

12:39.663 --> 13:03.523
the Admiral came out and met General Stratton, or 
met all of us, but General Stratton was leading us,

12:39.663 --> 13:03.523
coming down the hall, and he had his finger, you 
know, tell him something, you see. And General

13:04.465 --> 13:14.199
Stratton's a funny kind of a man, a real fine 
gentleman that certain things he doesn't, he

13:04.465 --> 13:14.199
draws a line on. He reached out and caught the 
Admiral's finger right there.

13:19.687 --> 13:22.491
And he said, I might just bite that thing off.

13:25.289 --> 13:34.021
And the admiral, of course, was most embarrassed 
and most apologetic and everything else, but he

13:25.289 --> 13:34.021
just got away from it and do it. Well, we went on in 
and the officers sat down and the admiral told us

13:34.802 --> 13:51.465
what his problem was and he wanted to get going and 
he didn't seem to be able to get the air supply and

13:34.802 --> 13:51.465
the other things to match up.

13:52.643 --> 13:58.949
I reminded the Admiral that we had sent him a wire 
yesterday laying out what the situation was, and

13:52.643 --> 13:58.949
it hadn't changed. And as far as we knew, they were 
ready to go, and we didn't know what else they

14:00.030 --> 14:07.597
needed. I said, by the way, would you like to know 
what our last two airplane loads were this

14:08.197 --> 14:14.743
morning? He said, yes, I would. I said, remember, 
they're outdoor toilet seats. and he looked as

14:23.069 --> 14:45.769
though he thought that was absolutely 
incredible,

14:23.069 --> 14:45.769
and relaxed a minute and said, until he used to get 
General so-and-so, I've forgotten his name, up on

14:23.069 --> 14:45.769
the phone,

14:23.069 --> 14:45.769
which he did. The Admiral told him if he wasn't 
across that chimney by four o'clock the next

14:47.116 --> 14:58.201
morning, he would have to look up to a lance 
corporal.

14:58.221 --> 14:59.785
Look up to a lance corporal. Lance corporal,

14:59.845 --> 15:05.698
yeah. Well, we got things all straightened out and 
started to leave and went outside and I knew some of

15:07.248 --> 15:14.999
the, a lot of the British officers that was there. 
One of them was outside, he wasn't privileged to be

15:15.139 --> 15:19.284
in with all them. And he said, what's he had a mouth 
power in that? I said, well he was talking to Donald

15:25.633 --> 15:28.457
so-and-so up at Imphal. He said, well why the hell 
doesn't he use the phone?

15:36.053 --> 15:51.252
No,

15:36.053 --> 15:51.252
but I thought that was a wonderful man,

15:36.053 --> 15:51.252
and a very dedicated and understanding man. He had 
a hard road to hold.

15:57.920 --> 16:03.327
Prime Minister Churchill was looking right down 
his throat on everything.

16:05.956 --> 16:11.221
So he had some real problems, but I thought he was a 
wonderful man and did a wonderful job. Did that

16:11.241 --> 16:13.643
major general move out that next morning? Yes, he 
did. He didn't have any problems either. He didn't

16:19.749 --> 16:21.651
have any problems with his toilet seats? No, he 
didn't.

16:27.316 --> 16:32.841
We followed with air support, and the weather was 
reasonable enough that we could do it. And what we

16:34.458 --> 16:44.689
found was that the Japanese had occupied Dakang 
and then they'd been cut off from their supplies

16:34.458 --> 16:44.689
and they were damn near starved to death and it was 
just a riot. Just routed them out and there was not

16:46.010 --> 16:58.043
really no fight to it at all because they weren't in 
a position to hold anything. They were just

16:58.343 --> 17:01.647
hungry.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.678
Which leads you to all kinds of other things. Why 
the hell didn't we know that? How come we fed all

17:09.442 --> 17:19.993
those millions or hundreds of thousands of people 
out there all that time when we didn't need to, and a

17:09.442 --> 17:19.993
lot of other things, but you can't answer those 
questions in retrospect.

17:22.355 --> 17:24.097
Not this far, indeed. I was wondering about 
another thing. Generally, how would you describe

17:27.320 --> 17:31.785
Anglo-American relations? in your theater? In 
the theater, in India, Anglo-American relations

17:34.938 --> 17:41.826
were not good.

17:46.210 --> 17:48.913
I'm talking about between military people. I'm 
not mixing in the civilians and the Indians and all

17:51.276 --> 17:55.040
that sort of thing. I'm talking about— Why were 
they not good? They were not good because General

17:57.242 --> 18:01.367
Joe Stilwell

18:03.659 --> 18:09.909
did not get along with any of the British people 
that he had to work with there. And their

18:11.471 --> 18:14.015
objectives were not the same.

18:17.100 --> 18:28.597
If one said, who's right, or

18:17.100 --> 18:28.597
whatnot, you'd have to say, well, hell, they 
obviously were both wrong, which they were. The

18:30.200 --> 18:32.383
British, I must say, were not a damn bit bashful 
about using American things or using us in any way

18:33.325 --> 18:38.372
they could. For example? For example, reversal 
and lease. They would ride our airplanes any time

18:44.660 --> 18:48.425
they got their thumb work. I never said a word, but 
if we wanted to ride one of their airplanes, We got a

18:56.090 --> 19:01.775
pass onto that airplane, and it got charged back 
through the channels. And their government

19:01.916 --> 19:04.518
collected for air travel.

19:07.121 --> 19:13.687
But they had no mechanism whereby we could do this.

19:13.707 --> 19:15.048
That's just one little example. And there are 
thousands of others. And of course, the dam's not

19:16.570 --> 19:19.252
bigger than that. And people didn't like that 
attitude.

19:27.258 --> 19:32.243
And there were a lot of things about us that they 
didn't like. Uncle Joe Stilwell wanted to go into

19:33.865 --> 19:37.289
Burma and kick the Japs out of there. Well, from the 
British point of view, there were a hell of a lot of

19:38.530 --> 19:42.454
things a lot more important than that. And a hell of 
a lot higher priority than that over there. So they

19:46.599 --> 19:47.499
didn't agree. And Chiang Kai-shek, of course, 
didn't like the British. and their objectives

19:53.937 --> 19:58.403
were not the same as his by any means.

20:03.090 --> 20:10.140
Stillwell was also his ground force commander in 
Chiang.

20:11.543 --> 20:16.209
So that accentuated the problem, rubbed it in a 
bit.

20:19.174 --> 20:23.640
In retrospect, we had some people in China People 
in the press and people in the diplomatic service

20:24.987 --> 20:43.654
who are sympathetic to the communists and were 
taking advantage of that time to help them out.

20:46.790 --> 21:01.871
No one could see this plainly and say this is the 
case, but it caused one awful lot of disruption

20:46.790 --> 21:01.871
over there, even in the middle of the fighting. 
Could you give me an example of that? Well, yes. You

21:05.856 --> 21:16.611
remember the problems General Hurley had when he 
came over there as ambassador to China. I was in

21:18.295 --> 21:24.222
trouble with Davies and with Stewart, whether. 
And

21:24.242 --> 21:34.715
it was very, very disruptive.

21:34.735 --> 21:47.931
So you had mixed up in any of those things with 
Colonel Hurley in Chungking and the embassy and

21:34.735 --> 21:47.931
Stilwell commanding ground forces in Vermont and 
China and American ground forces in India.

21:49.025 --> 22:03.740
Chenault was in control of all the air forces that 
Chiang had and had to be helping what

21:49.025 --> 22:03.740
we did and what the British did. Then

22:03.780 --> 22:17.293
we go over and integrate all those forces into a 
British command, even though it was under

22:03.780 --> 22:17.293
American actual command. still answered to a 
British man. And it made things hard to keep the

22:20.875 --> 22:25.281
wheels turning. Sure, it was towns. And that's 
where I spent my hours around the clock. My office

22:31.969 --> 22:37.957
hours ran from seven in the morning until two in the 
morning usually.

22:42.883 --> 22:45.947
I had the best bunch of people I've ever had 
anywhere. Under your command? In my staff. I

22:49.854 --> 22:50.835
didn't have a command. Yeah, in your staff. In my 
staff. What rank were you when you left? When I went

22:57.503 --> 23:04.352
to India in 43, I was a brand new colonel. In August 
of 44, I was promoted to Brigadier General, so I was

23:04.372 --> 23:10.679
a general officer the rest of the time. Brigadier 
General the rest of the time I was there.

23:19.913 --> 23:39.450
Okay, now getting back to, I want to talk about the 
generalship later, but getting back to Asia, it's

23:19.913 --> 23:39.450
your contention then that the communists in Asia 
during the war were disrupting the situation and

23:19.913 --> 23:39.450
making relations between the allies even worse. 
Well, not so much the communists. Well, yes,

23:42.053 --> 23:48.098
that's true, although that was not the major thing 
that I was referring to in that at all. Mao Zedong

23:48.382 --> 23:57.149
and his communists and whatnot had pulled back and 
were consolidating and building their own

23:48.382 --> 23:57.149
strength. And of course they were fighting the 
Japanese too. Sure they were, yeah. They had

24:04.095 --> 24:07.818
nothing to gain from the Japanese. They allegedly 
were helping us and they did help a little bit. They

24:12.202 --> 24:18.287
let us put in a weather service up through

24:12.202 --> 24:18.287
that area. They were looking for— Did you ever 
visit that Weather Service? Well, yes, I operated

24:22.767 --> 24:28.877
it, but—and I went up there, I think, twice. Did you 
ever meet any of those people? Oh, yeah. Did you

24:33.304 --> 24:34.786
ever—who did you meet? Well, Charles— Charles 
Lyme? Yeah, and Mao. You did? Yeah, and— Gee, I

24:41.537 --> 24:44.342
didn't know them. I didn't have a great deal to do 
with them, but I did meet them. Well, tell me about

24:48.647 --> 24:50.009
those meetings. Well, one went up there to try to 
put in, to say a weather service is stretching the

24:50.570 --> 24:59.463
point a little bit. What we tried to do was to 
indoctrinate

24:59.483 --> 25:08.136
about 30 Chinese people in how to read some crude 
instruments that we give them to give wind

25:09.196 --> 25:18.490
direction and velocity and temperature and 
humidity. And to get that to another one of their

25:20.072 --> 25:32.270
people who could get it to the radio station so it 
could be sent out and we could pick it up. I'm trying

25:33.673 --> 25:38.680
to think of the name of the man who built all these 
things.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.002
Very famous guy, makes me mad. I don't remember, 
and I'll have to get that name for you.

25:53.609 --> 26:04.684
He made the anemometers out of spoons and 
thermometers out of alcohol and straws and eggs

26:05.407 --> 26:10.734
with the centers taken out. These kind of things 
that give them a way to do it. Spillhouse.

26:18.345 --> 26:18.906
Spillhouse?

26:21.650 --> 26:22.471
Yeah. Who later became dean of science at the 
University of Minnesota? That's right. Sure. I

26:27.578 --> 26:31.744
know him personally, but we've interviewed him as 
a matter of fact. I know him very well personally.

26:34.207 --> 26:35.008
I've met a lot of them. A lot of times, a lot of nights 
with him then and since then. He's an interesting

26:39.455 --> 26:41.358
character. He was a consultant to me out at the Jet 
Propulsion Lab as a matter of fact. And so the one

26:47.828 --> 27:04.793
time that I went up there and I talked with Mao about 
what it was we were trying to do and how we wanted to

26:47.828 --> 27:04.793
talk to some of the people to get it lined up.

27:06.882 --> 27:14.592
So Spillhouse and a couple of the others did most of 
the talking with those people. They were up there

27:14.632 --> 27:19.759
for a couple of weeks, two or three times. I was only 
up there for that one day, one visit. Then after the

27:25.146 --> 27:31.995
war ended, it was after the Japanese through 
Natal, but prior to September 2nd formal

27:33.815 --> 28:02.016
training,

27:33.815 --> 28:02.016
Mao and Chao

27:33.815 --> 28:02.016
and three of the others, and I've forgotten who 
they were, came down to Chongqing at the American

27:33.815 --> 28:02.016
ambassador's request, and I've forgotten now 
whether that was General

28:04.747 --> 28:15.268
Hurley or the man who followed him, one or the 
other. Anyway, they came down there and they

28:15.288 --> 28:25.287
landed at Chongqing in a DC-3, which was about the 
biggest airplane you could get into Chongqing.

28:26.482 --> 28:36.543
And I had been to India and had come back to 
Chongqing, except I landed at a military base

28:26.482 --> 28:36.543
about 20 miles out and drove in. And I drove in to the 
Chongqing airport. in time to join the group that

28:40.758 --> 28:49.929
went to meet them, which was a delegation from the 
embassy. I mean, the American ambassador

28:50.730 --> 28:56.477
wouldn't go out there to meet this particular 
group, so he sent somebody. And I just joined them,

28:56.497 --> 29:01.483
went out and talked with them there for a while. And 
then I went to, and I talked with Chang while they

29:02.264 --> 29:10.073
were there about some aspects of their visit.

29:13.850 --> 29:16.393
And I never did, I didn't see any more of them. I had 
no further contact with either one of them. Now,

29:19.137 --> 29:22.321
they were up in, wasn't it, Yunnan Province? Yes. 
During the war, what were their living conditions

29:23.643 --> 29:26.586
like up there? Well, they were damn primitive. 
That's what I thought. Very, very primitive, and

29:31.633 --> 29:40.144
almost on a starvation situation. But so was 
everything else in China almost. It wasn't

29:44.801 --> 29:48.106
comparatively so terribly bad.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.853
How did they treat you when they went up to Yunnan? 
Oh, very nice. They had nothing to lose from the

29:55.937 --> 30:01.606
things they did with me. I stationed a man up there 
and left him up there at the headquarters. He

30:08.616 --> 30:09.658
stayed up there I don't know, three or four months. 
And collected this weapon, got it out, and he ran—

30:14.419 --> 30:17.522
Was he American? Yes, he was the U.S. Air Force 
officer. And he ran some,

30:21.247 --> 30:29.056
handled some missions out of there, some fighter 
missions against the Japanese.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.342
And they just didn't bother him either way. I mean, 
the communists didn't. I'm sure they watched down

30:35.684 --> 30:39.949
carefully what he did, but they didn't try to 
interfere in any way. Were they cordial to you, or

30:41.971 --> 30:44.113
suspicious? Do you remember what they said? Well, 
they were real cordial and all, and they of course

30:46.775 --> 30:57.185
didn't act suspicious, but they were looking at 
the long range thing. There wasn't anything in the

30:57.265 --> 31:00.708
short range that they were worried about. We 
weren't going to attack them. China didn't have

31:04.372 --> 31:06.594
the capacity to attack them. Both of us were 
fighting the Japanese. weren't anything to be

31:10.743 --> 31:12.304
worrying about. They could just sit and try to 
consolidate themselves as well as they could and

31:14.686 --> 31:39.028
get past the present crisis and try to survive, 
which they did very well, you see, because when the

31:14.686 --> 31:39.028
war ended and as a result of lack of agreement at 
that particular conference, a decision was made

31:14.686 --> 31:39.028
to move several of Chiang's divisions from the 
south, and even from Burma, up into the area of

31:39.464 --> 31:55.891
Pekin, Tencent, and all in order to hold it from the 
Communists. And we did move by air at the end of that

31:55.911 --> 32:06.248
pipeline starting way back in India, which made it 
one hell of a job. And we got them in place, and they

32:07.105 --> 32:17.376
consolidated their position, and we're in firm 
control of Pekin, Tencent, and the whole northern

32:07.105 --> 32:17.376
area. But things turned sour back here in the U.S., 
and the China lobby, and all of the trouble in the

32:19.459 --> 32:32.012
State Department, and everything else. So the 
ships that were supposed to supply those

32:38.037 --> 32:43.203
nationalist Chinese that we moved in never did get 
there.

32:46.947 --> 32:55.416
And the troops sat there, out of ammunition, out of 
food, and eventually were taken over by the

32:46.947 --> 32:55.416
Communists. General Marshall went there with his 
mission, if you remember, to try to ameliorate

32:56.637 --> 33:01.502
that situation.

33:03.985 --> 33:07.048
And he probably did for a couple of weeks or so, but 
in the long run went on to the communists and the

33:07.501 --> 33:23.020
nationalist divisions were holding home and 
whatever material they had went to help the Maoist

33:07.501 --> 33:23.020
forces. Were the British and the Americans back in 
India with your post, were any of the British and

33:23.040 --> 33:37.018
Americans worried during the war, 1944 and 1945, 
about the possibility of communism in Southeast

33:37.319 --> 33:41.284
Asia or in China itself? Both of us were, very much. 
Do you remember any examples, any specifics?

33:47.652 --> 34:01.490
Well, I remember, of course, a lot of specific 
conversations about it, but in terms of actions

33:47.652 --> 34:01.490
that

33:47.652 --> 34:01.490
would have anything to do with the course of the 
war, no. Because, you see, Russia was not active

34:02.151 --> 34:07.157
over there in that theater at all. and the Chinese 
communists then were the only communist forces

34:08.386 --> 34:26.331
that had to reckon with and they were isolated and 
didn't have a damn thing to fight with and weren't

34:08.386 --> 34:26.331
trying to get in a battle anyhow. So militarily 
there was very little that happened over there

34:27.412 --> 34:35.423
that had any impact either way. seeing the writing 
on the wall a long ways off, lots of us didn't like

34:36.213 --> 34:41.719
it. And in retrospect, you can certainly see

34:43.520 --> 34:59.917
what was being planned if you read Teddy White's 
book, Thunder Out of China, and several others

34:43.520 --> 34:59.917
that have written since then. And that was being 
planned right there at that time. Teddy White and

35:05.727 --> 35:10.893
that woman that worked with him, Annalee Jacoby. 
Hell, they were in our headquarters half of the

35:11.714 --> 35:15.098
damn time. No kidding. Trying to ride our 
airplanes everywhere one would go. One or the

35:18.422 --> 35:21.645
other would be there trying to be on it to go.

35:27.592 --> 35:30.395
Again, they weren't there acting as communists. 
They just wanted to get the story? They, well, it

35:32.879 --> 35:35.061
was a little more than that. They wanted to get a 
story all right, but their mind was pretty well

35:35.862 --> 36:01.806
made up, and it's like a lot of the people that 
you've seen since that time, who, they don't want

35:35.862 --> 36:01.806
to say they're communists or anything, but they 
don't miss a single opportunity to degrade

35:35.862 --> 36:01.806
anything that's U.S., anything that's American, 
to make a damn how good it is, why it's bad, there's

35:35.862 --> 36:01.806
something wrong with it. same thing in the 
communist side of the house, it's either never

36:02.697 --> 36:08.885
mentioned or it's praised in an entirely 
different light. And that was kind of the way with

36:10.447 --> 36:32.417
Teddy and with Jacoby and Davies and Davies' wife 
and Stuart,

36:10.447 --> 36:32.417
although I really shouldn't be getting on record 
about those particular things, Stuart and

36:10.447 --> 36:32.417
Davies, because that's that had its airing in 
proper form, decisions were made. Now as far as

36:39.513 --> 36:54.152
joint planning, joint planning seems to me, from 
what you've said, to be pretty close between the

36:39.513 --> 36:54.152
British and the Americans at the Southeast Asia 
Air Command.

36:55.550 --> 37:02.498
Did that come to an end immediately after Japan 
surrendered, or how long did it take for that

36:55.550 --> 37:02.498
planning to collapse? I mean obviously there's no 
need for it, the war is over, but I mean as far as

37:02.818 --> 37:07.823
post-war planning or anything like that. Was 
there a switch then? Well,

37:09.505 --> 37:13.409
yes and no. It was strictly joint military 
planning at our level, at a theater level. There

37:21.959 --> 37:24.882
was really not much to do except How did we 
disengage and get our people and our materials out

37:25.537 --> 37:38.529
and take care of accountability for them? 
Decisions had to be made of whether you were going

37:41.072 --> 37:55.425
to let the British have all these on Lind's lease, 
whether you were going to destroy them, or whether

37:41.072 --> 37:55.425
you were going to try to ship them back to the United 
States or ship them somewhere else, Japan for

37:41.072 --> 37:55.425
example. And so there was a great deal of joint 
planning went on in that line under, with directed

37:55.945 --> 38:04.053
objectives. It wasn't a question of deciding 
what's best for, at my level of course, it had been

38:04.153 --> 38:12.181
at some other level. That having been done,

38:12.201 --> 38:23.252
then there's really not much left for a theater 
level to do.

38:26.911 --> 38:53.914
We had already moved long before this to China, and 
as

38:26.911 --> 38:53.914
of the time the Japanese surrendered, I was in 
Chongqing, and in October I had already moved to

38:26.911 --> 38:53.914
Shanghai,

38:26.911 --> 38:53.914
and Southeast Asia Command, that is Southeast 
Asia Air Command, no longer existed even then.

38:57.168 --> 39:10.345
And so the joint planning at theater level 
disappeared

38:57.168 --> 39:10.345
just as fast as we could dispose of the problems we 
faced as a result of the end of the war. We didn't do

39:11.246 --> 39:25.504
any forward planning as to what we would do in the 
theater because everything that was on an

39:11.246 --> 39:25.504
American mind was get out of here and get home. 
Sure, demobilization. Not only there, but here

39:28.062 --> 39:30.145
also. It was the same thing on their mind. I stayed 
longer in order to consolidate an awful lot of

39:35.151 --> 39:54.394
records that were over there and then to go to Japan 
and present

39:35.151 --> 39:54.394
the Air Force operations in India and China. to the 
U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, that group that—

39:55.268 --> 40:01.604
Sure, wrote all the reports. Wrote all those 
reports. Paul Nitsche was the deputy of that at

40:03.027 --> 40:05.934
that time. I met Paul in Tokyo at that 
presentation. I've known him ever since. I don't

40:19.429 --> 40:22.192
envy him his job up to this morning by a damn sight. 
No. Trying to clean up after Haig and Gromyko left

40:23.234 --> 40:31.603
last night over in Geneva.

40:37.029 --> 40:39.492
I was wondering about Ambassador Patrick Early. 
There have been a lot of accounts of course written

40:40.593 --> 40:43.416
about those years in the mid and late 40s in China in 
our role, and some historians and journalists

40:44.425 --> 41:03.362
have reported that Hurley was not the most capable 
man in dealing with that role, and I was wondering

40:44.425 --> 41:03.362
what your response to that is.

41:06.110 --> 41:09.295
I guess I might be a little prejudiced. I don't 
know. You know, General Hurley was a good many

41:12.100 --> 41:16.327
things before he became Ambassador to China. And

41:17.168 --> 41:28.928
he was, in addition to anything else he might have 
been, he was a good politician.

41:31.405 --> 41:40.902
I'm not sure I know all the things that go into a good 
politician.

41:40.922 --> 41:53.785
And my relationship

41:40.922 --> 41:53.785
with General Hurley was such that I didn't have an 
opportunity to make the kind of judgments that

41:55.047 --> 41:57.852
that are being called for by these people. I have a 
notion that a good many of them had even less of an

41:57.992 --> 42:05.084
opportunity, but they made the judgment anyway. 
My contact with him, well I had met him two or three

42:05.104 --> 42:19.148
times here in the United States when he was 
Secretary of War or something else, but he

42:05.104 --> 42:19.148
wouldn't have remembered my name even. when I went 
to India, he was already in China for the Sexton

42:20.630 --> 42:27.338
Conference.

42:31.183 --> 42:38.312
He was going to go to the conference from 
Chongqing.

42:38.332 --> 42:42.037
And General Stratton and I were going from New 
Delhi, India.

42:45.661 --> 42:48.004
So, General Hurley thumbed a ride over the hump, 
which was the only way he could get there to New

42:48.541 --> 43:05.236
Delhi, and then went with us from New Delhi to 
Cairo, and spent the time with us in Cairo until he

42:48.541 --> 43:05.236
went home with Chang and Madame Chang. Oh, I don't 
know, after four or five days, whereas I stayed on

43:07.257 --> 43:15.224
two or three weeks and worked on other things. But 
Donald Stratenbauer's airplane was a B-24,

43:19.760 --> 43:20.861
combat B-24. It had two niceties in it. Under the 
top gun turret there was a bench that you could sit

43:28.491 --> 43:45.852
on, and in the back where the side gun turrets were, 
we had cleaned out some of the communications

43:28.491 --> 43:45.852
equipment and put two narrow bunks down there. 
Otherwise it was a combat B-24 with a combat crew

43:47.131 --> 43:52.539
and armed and gunned and everything else.

43:56.104 --> 44:05.598
On the way to Cairo, Della Hurley and I rode in the 
belly on these two little bunks that we had put on.

44:07.741 --> 44:10.024
And it's quite a long way from New Delhi to Cairo. It 
sure is. So we had quite a bit of time to talk, and we

44:11.146 --> 44:14.691
did. in spite of the roar and four engines, and tend 
to be quite loud talk. I found him to be a really

44:21.008 --> 44:42.754
delightful person, a real fine sense of humor, and 
a wide, wide knowledge of, in some cases, detailed

44:21.008 --> 44:42.754
knowledge of a wide range of subjects, and an 
acquaintance with people that I just couldn't

44:21.008 --> 44:42.754
believe. I mean, he just knew everybody. And every 
one of them. By the time we got to Cairo, I had a very

44:50.734 --> 44:55.079
great respect for him.

44:58.183 --> 45:02.228
I didn't get to see very much of him after we got 
back. Well, of course, he was in Chongqing, and I

45:02.408 --> 45:09.397
was in New Delhi, and that's further apart from San 
Francisco and New York. Well, it's about as far

45:10.077 --> 45:11.319
apart. In that time, it was no way to get there.

45:18.222 --> 45:22.867
So I saw him four or five times up there and talked 
with him. But I didn't get to know him as associated

45:25.330 --> 45:32.037
with the decisions that were being currently 
made. Obviously, it was a hell of a lot of fire where

45:33.379 --> 45:40.727
he was pointing the smoke. And when you have 
someone in your own organization who is

45:41.027 --> 45:47.554
undercutting you, particularly your number two 
man, going to be problems. I don't care what the job

45:50.510 --> 45:55.055
is or what the organization is." And so he had a real 
ugly one there.

46:01.221 --> 46:10.711
And I guess for my money he handled it just about as 
well as you could, considering the support that he

46:01.221 --> 46:10.711
didn't get from the States. I think back here in 
Washington, If you look back now at what happened

46:17.740 --> 46:36.373
shortly after that, you could say that

46:17.740 --> 46:36.373
one espousing the ideas that General Hurley had 
would

46:17.740 --> 46:36.373
be undercut on every side in Washington. the same 
as I mentioned a minute ago, when Chiang

46:37.417 --> 46:46.528
Kai-shek's troops, having been moved into 
position, were allowed to sit there and starve to

46:37.417 --> 46:46.528
death and didn't get support. We wouldn't have 
moved them in if we hadn't provided for the support

46:47.849 --> 46:53.135
in advance, but it didn't make it. And I'm not sure 
where it went, but...

46:59.506 --> 47:02.535
I think it was deep-sixed. So you blame the Truman 
administration now? Well, I hate to say

47:04.901 --> 47:07.188
administration. I really blame the China lobby in 
the Congress.
