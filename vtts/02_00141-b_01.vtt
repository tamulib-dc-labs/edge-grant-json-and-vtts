WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:10.957
I

00:02.748 --> 00:10.957
think they had the same A&M Aggie attitude. And I 
think there were some round outs and things like

00:11.037 --> 00:16.383
that that went on. But I never participated. I 
never cared to. I participated probably in some

00:22.069 --> 00:24.731
hazing, but not a lot. I wanted the main service 
that was provided. But beyond that, I didn't do a

00:32.397 --> 00:33.638
lot. I just wasn't interested in it. Did the A&M 
traditions remain comparatively consistent? I

00:40.105 --> 00:40.746
think they did. I think they did. They began 
wearing fish stripes again during

00:42.508 --> 00:49.395
that period of time, which was good. I don't think 
that hurt anybody. I don't think that doing

00:52.999 --> 01:00.227
certain details, as we called it, by the 
upperclassmen for a freshman at all properly

00:52.999 --> 01:00.227
handled.

01:04.207 --> 01:09.073
I do disagree with the majority of the physical 
hazing, but I don't think some of it is so bad. Doing

01:09.654 --> 01:13.960
so bad, the military academies today wouldn't be 
doing it. But there is a limit, and I'm willing to

01:15.101 --> 01:24.914
accept that there are strong limits.

01:24.935 --> 01:27.177
I'm not big on this hazing aspect. We talked about 
hitchhiking. Oh, social life after the war.

01:32.455 --> 01:34.619
Getting dates and so forth. I did date some after 
the war a couple of times with some girls from

01:34.639 --> 01:38.425
Bryan. I don't know how, somebody I knew got me the 
dates. Maybe Dick Harrison. God, I don't have any

01:44.035 --> 01:48.622
idea. Well, there was another guy I could have done 
it to, I can't remember. But I had a few dates with

01:53.691 --> 01:57.197
them, but mostly We would go to Houston,

01:58.645 --> 02:05.651
went to TSCW with my roommate for a weekend. He was 
eventually, he was engaged, became engaged to

02:05.712 --> 02:12.998
marry the girl he went up to see, and I went up with 
him for a couple weekends. How did you all get up

02:13.058 --> 02:14.300
there? Oh, we hitchhiked. And when you were there, 
where did you stay? We got hotel rooms at that

02:18.063 --> 02:27.792
point, but there were many nights, I forgot about 
this, we went to San Antonio to play football games

02:18.063 --> 02:27.792
and play Trinity and

02:30.758 --> 02:35.263
Dallas, Austin, and we just spent in the lobbies of 
the hotels. Lots of nights like that. We did get a

02:39.387 --> 02:41.169
hotel when we went there. There were court trips 
after the war. Were there court trips before you

02:43.271 --> 02:46.474
went away? Yes. Yes, there were court trips. And 
Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Austin?

02:57.786 --> 02:59.247
Houston, two a year. One north, one south? Yeah, we 
didn't go to Waco at that point. We did Fort Worth

03:04.157 --> 03:07.761
and Dallas. And describe the routine of march, and 
where, and how, and so forth. I don't remember much

03:17.613 --> 03:20.777
more than we marched from Austin. Of course, it was 
down near the river, near the first or sixth street

03:20.797 --> 03:27.044
in that area. We formed and marched towards the 
capital. Houston, we marched from near then City

03:31.120 --> 03:38.433
Hall south. The viewing stand was at the Rice 
Hotel, as I remember it back then. And that would

03:45.284 --> 03:47.007
occur about what time of day? Mid-morning on 
Saturday before the game.

03:52.537 --> 03:55.281
Dallas, I don't remember where we were. Baker 
Street or what we did there. Was it assumed that

03:56.956 --> 04:00.180
every member of the Corps would go? What if you 
couldn't make the Corps trip? Was that all right?

04:06.628 --> 04:08.030
They were encouraged to go. No punishment? Not 
that I remember. After the war, was the routine

04:12.595 --> 04:14.357
similar? As I remember. It was a leisure. After my, 
let's see, I guess when I was Last of my first

04:23.838 --> 04:26.882
semester back, I got a car. That would have been 
about May of 47, I guess it was. Thereabouts, I got a

04:32.249 --> 04:35.172
car, so that made it easy. We all shared gasoline 
expenses. We'd fill up the car with three or four or

04:38.457 --> 04:44.004
five people, and we all shared gasoline expenses. 
Where did an Aggie keep his car? That time, we had

04:46.447 --> 04:50.672
parking lots near Duncan. I think whether it's the 
drill field that was where we had . But that's the

04:57.904 --> 05:02.270
general area, probably still a parking lot. Where 
were there any places that were sort of off limits

05:02.370 --> 05:13.887
to Aggie students in the Brasses County area? 
Well, we closed Ed's after my first semester. I

05:16.430 --> 05:17.452
went out there one time. Where was that? On the old 
Highway 6 to Houston. I remember it as a

05:22.276 --> 05:24.178
stone-fronted building. I was there once and then 
it got closed. Was that Hard Liquor's? No. No, it

05:30.025 --> 05:30.726
was Ed's. It might have been Hard Liquor's too. I 
knew it was Ed's. What did they serve? Beer, of

05:34.791 --> 05:37.354
course. Was there said to be a house of ill repute 
anywhere in Brasses County? Not that anybody ever

05:43.120 --> 05:45.883
showed me or told me about. Where did y'all get 
whiskey? Somehow or other we got across to

05:53.242 --> 05:55.124
Dimebox, isn't that near there across the river? I 
don't remember. Somewhere across the river north

05:55.865 --> 05:59.669
of Bryan. I don't remember. I only remember how we 
got there. Was it normal for anybody to have

06:03.433 --> 06:08.579
alcohol in the dormitory? I don't think so. I think 
we just managed to drink it before we came back. I

06:13.665 --> 06:14.566
never kept any. I don't know. They might have had 
some. Not before the war. After the war, there was

06:18.430 --> 06:21.814
more than one bottle stored, I'm sure. What were 
the important, either before or after the war,

06:22.891 --> 06:30.699
what were the important social events of the year? 
Class dances. Held where? Sabisa. Describe them

06:37.447 --> 06:41.291
in terms of what happened and how you dressed. 
Well, just in uniform, before the war certainly,

06:41.992 --> 06:48.679
and afterwards when I was in the Corps, I dressed in 
uniform, I know. Class A uniform. The girls were

06:53.547 --> 06:54.908
formals. How were the girls? They stayed in the 
empty dormitories that were empty for them, or

06:56.209 --> 07:05.017
professors' homes or civilian homes. How were 
they treated at those dances? I think with the

07:09.241 --> 07:14.165
utmost respect, I don't ever remember having any 
difficulty with that. Were there any notable

07:16.067 --> 07:19.510
musical organizations that came? No, none that I 
remember in special. Because before the war,

07:22.598 --> 07:23.700
there were. I've not heard of any after the war. 
Yeah, I've never heard of it. I don't

07:27.845 --> 07:36.856
know

07:27.845 --> 07:36.856
any. Let's see. No notable world events during 
your return to? After the war. Yeah, the Texas City

07:48.768 --> 07:54.414
disaster. Oh, describe that. Well, we heard about 
it. We all went on top of Dorm 9. I think we heard

08:01.961 --> 08:07.186
about it over the radio while we were sunbathing on 
the top roof of Dorm 9. And we all looked towards

08:08.507 --> 08:11.450
Houston and swore that we saw smoke. That's a 
debatable question, too. I'm looking at my notes.

08:18.728 --> 08:33.344
Other

08:18.728 --> 08:33.344
than alcohol, were there any other substances 
that people used that most people would have said

08:18.728 --> 08:33.344
were not permissible? I never heard of that drug. 
Cigarettes, of course. They were encouraged. But

08:42.194 --> 08:48.221
the advertising at that period of time, this 
encouraged people to smoke, and nobody thought

08:42.194 --> 08:48.221
anything about it. You smoked the smoke. What do 
you remember as the most popular varieties? I

08:52.285 --> 08:55.629
remember Lucky Strike Green has gone to war, 
Campbell's. Cigars were smoked in jail practice

08:57.791 --> 09:03.157
at some. No chugged back and no snuff. I don't 
remember those. All right, football games after

09:08.543 --> 09:10.986
the war. Any change? We formed the T, the block T at 
home. On the field? On the field. Who was in the T?

09:26.053 --> 09:27.255
I think everybody but freshmen. We might even have 
freshmen. I don't remember any discrimination,

09:29.918 --> 09:34.043
but I know certainly the juniors and seniors were. 
And that was stopped when they ran over Doug Walker

09:35.565 --> 09:41.192
at the SMU game. The following year or two after 
that, it was stopped. I think that was good and bad,

09:45.121 --> 09:50.789
but I thought it was a good formation to have. I 
liked it. Who were some of the sports celebrities

09:52.591 --> 09:55.896
of your student days?

10:01.463 --> 10:06.950
Bill Geary,

10:01.463 --> 10:06.950
who's the president, I think, of Texas Utilities 
today. He played center on the football team. Not

10:08.873 --> 10:09.574
Bill Geary. Bill Geary was in. played in,

10:10.990 --> 10:16.717
Bob Geary. G-A-R-Y. G-A-R-Y.

10:26.629 --> 10:39.664
Marion Flanagan, Red Burdette,

10:26.629 --> 10:39.664
football, Earl Beasley, pitcher in baseball 
before the, well, and then I can't think of the

10:40.184 --> 10:41.485
name. Hondo. Hondo. Hartone? Yeah, Clint 
Hartone. Not Clint, but he was punting for the

10:46.491 --> 10:50.995
football team too. My half played fleeting. Clint 
Hartone was a Giants baseball player, but he did

10:54.559 --> 10:58.683
have one. What was his name? I can't think of it. 
Robert Smith. Well, those were later years. That

11:07.736 --> 11:08.637
was after I graduated. Oh, that's right. That's 
right. I'm sorry. But when I came back, it was

11:10.679 --> 11:19.930
Broussard and Marion Flanagan, I think I 
mentioned. Stubby Matthews.

11:24.716 --> 11:25.537
Do you remember any? Ed Steisenberger. Remember 
any special games? Winning or losing? Once it was

11:32.726 --> 11:33.407
Austin, Texas. I remember those.

11:38.926 --> 11:44.053
But other than that, as a student, I don't remember 
anything, what, so special. Okay, did you? We

11:46.456 --> 11:48.719
played, those days, we played at Olmby Stadium. We 
played SMU at Olmby Stadium, and I remember.

11:56.270 --> 11:57.552
Did you go through final review? Yes. Describe 
that, please. Probably the best military

12:00.856 --> 12:03.259
experience I had when I was there. I never could 
have had an officer

12:07.495 --> 12:07.996
reasons. Who knows? Grades weren't real good. I 
wasn't too outspoken. I was an athletic officer,

12:14.567 --> 12:17.933
but that didn't mean anything as a cadet officer.

12:23.001 --> 12:23.382
Who knows? Whatever the reason, I don't know. But 
yeah, I wasn't ever selected. But I did have an

12:26.908 --> 12:29.993
opportunity to be a battalion commander at the 
practice review, and that was a big thrill for me.

12:35.011 --> 12:37.673
Who came to the fine review from your family? I 
suppose my parents did, but I don't remember. Was

12:43.659 --> 12:49.544
there any notable dignitary at that fine review? 
Where was it held? Well, what do they call it, Oren

12:52.827 --> 12:57.711
Simpson's field now? Well, the drill field. The 
drill field, yeah. And then commencement, when

13:00.128 --> 13:04.834
you graduated? We went through commencement and 
commissioning, but I couldn't get a diploma

13:05.875 --> 13:11.501
because I hadn't finished summer camp for ROTC. I 
had a commitment there, so I went through, got my

13:12.302 --> 13:18.309
diploma and got my commission, but they were empty 
cylinders. And it was held where? On Kyle Field.

13:23.095 --> 13:23.636
Outdoors? Outdoors. Was there a notable speaker 
at that, or the year ago? I probably got the field at

13:29.609 --> 13:34.114
home, but I don't remember anything special that I 
can recall. Every name called? Every hand shaken?

13:36.057 --> 13:37.659
Every hand shaken, every name called. It was a big 
thrill to walk across and get commissioned and

13:37.679 --> 13:43.706
uniformed. Let's see. Was muster after the war 
there anything different?

13:54.859 --> 13:58.283
It wasn't as impressive a ceremony as it is today. 
I'm trying to remember where I was in April of 47.

14:03.958 --> 14:07.342
Nothing special stands out.

14:13.868 --> 14:14.248
Let's see. Bonfire. Describe bonfire in those 
days. All I know is it got built with big logs and

14:19.754 --> 14:26.020
upperclassmen health and where the logs came 
from. It was logs? Yeah. Alright, did you all have a

14:28.469 --> 14:30.912
bonfire during the war? As I remember we did. 
Where?

14:43.348 --> 14:45.130
I think it was on the drill field. I think you're 
right. I don't remember it was on the drill field.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.878
And was that trash? Later, no. They might have had 
some small trash, but most of it was still fairly

14:52.533 --> 14:58.018
good sized logs. Not nearly as high. Was there any 
kind of structure up on top? Of course, the old

15:01.462 --> 15:03.284
outhouse was always there. Where did those come 
from? Nobody ever knew. Especially in later

15:08.849 --> 15:10.991
years, they weren't used that much.

15:14.875 --> 15:21.882
Did you have any special friends from that 
post-war time that were? Jimmy McGregor was my

15:24.376 --> 15:29.221
roommate and I stayed in contact with him for many 
years afterwards. Of course, Babe Schwartz was

15:31.083 --> 15:35.587
after the war and I stayed, and still do. Duke Hobbs 
is a class agent now. One of the bigger thrills I

15:42.994 --> 15:52.864
ever had was becoming a class agent,

15:42.994 --> 15:52.864
later years of course after the war, and long 
after.

15:55.915 --> 15:57.518
Eddie Hinkle was killed in service.

16:01.884 --> 16:06.732
Oh, Buddy Powell and I remain close friends from 
all the way through. Johnny Murchison, Dick

16:07.193 --> 16:11.580
Osterholm, Paul Ostermeyer.

16:16.127 --> 16:19.412
Handball was an event in those days, old wooden 
handball courts. Trying to think how to tell you

16:22.096 --> 16:23.779
where they were. They were just west of the P.L. 
Downs Natatorium. Wooden frame buildings that

16:31.407 --> 16:33.690
were used for handball courts. They didn't play 
racquetball, they played handball. Those were

16:37.174 --> 16:41.199
used quite a bit. The guy who eventually married my 
cousin and I played a lot of handball there from

16:41.219 --> 16:45.524
Waco, Harvey Miller. That's in 48. Was 
intramurals important? Intramurals, they

16:52.248 --> 16:55.813
weren't that important, but we participated. I 
remember in softball and football, I didn't do

16:57.075 --> 17:02.643
basketball, I never could sink a basket.

17:05.186 --> 17:09.592
But I think those are the only ones that I recall. 
Did you go by train much? No, we didn't go by train

17:14.218 --> 17:16.121
very much. I think I had one Several times I came 
back from Houston on the train late at night. We

17:23.602 --> 17:38.763
used to run a cross-country course as freshmen,

17:23.602 --> 17:38.763
which was around the then dairy barn and I guess 
cattle pens, cow pens, the dusty violent

17:23.602 --> 17:38.763
six-tenths that we had to run. The best time I ever 
had was after I took the The owl from Houston got

17:43.240 --> 17:50.491
back at 4 o'clock in the morning, or maybe even 
later, and had to run at 8 o'clock. I was too tired

17:50.511 --> 17:52.113
not to stop. I know if I stopped, I'd never quit, 
never make it. When you're preparing to leave the

17:57.441 --> 18:04.331
campus with your new degree, what sort of world did 
you think you were entering? What was ahead? There

18:09.751 --> 18:10.873
was really nothing ahead. There were six jobs, as I 
recall, offered to aeronautical engineering

18:10.893 --> 18:17.605
graduates. Everybody wanted the one or two or 
three that were offered by Chance Lawton, which

18:17.625 --> 18:33.835
was in Connecticut, because he knew they were 
going to eventually, they already got announced

18:17.625 --> 18:33.835
moving back to Dallas, so everybody wanted to go 
there for a period of time

18:17.625 --> 18:33.835
so they could then get the experience and then move 
back. Again, whether the reasons, I have no idea.

18:39.032 --> 18:42.077
Probably poor grades and a poor interview, I 
didn't get one of them. So the next, and my dad was

18:42.978 --> 19:01.145
quite ill at the time, so I took the next best thing 
that turned out best because he was very ill. And

18:42.978 --> 19:01.145
went to work in his business, which was then known 
as Houston Paper Company. Never thought much

19:01.165 --> 19:04.210
about anything more than that, except it was a job. 
Did you feel that you were, that A&M had prepared

19:05.827 --> 19:13.857
you well? Not at that time because I, except one 
time later years, let's see this was probably, I

19:14.478 --> 19:28.375
finished in 48 so this might have been maybe 51 or 
so. We had built an addition to the building, and

19:29.519 --> 19:34.924
they were complaining because it was a hot area. 
The fans weren't drawing, but they had exhaust

19:35.805 --> 19:40.510
fans. And we had an entrance, a big 10-foot square 
warehouse entrance on the bend, which had been the

19:41.951 --> 19:52.061
east side of that section. The warehouse rail dock 
was on the north side, and they were complaining

19:53.203 --> 19:58.648
because they weren't I couldn't feel any of it. 
Well, I finally convinced the superintendent of

20:02.069 --> 20:16.791
that area and my dad that if they would close the 
doors halfway, that they would feel the draft more

20:02.069 --> 20:16.791
because of the velocity of the granite. And my dad 
said, you did learn something. That's the only

20:19.925 --> 20:29.100
time I know, except for using the slide rules of 
multiply and divide, is the only time I felt like I

20:19.925 --> 20:29.100
ever used any of it, by education, official 
education. Back to interviewing. Did the

20:31.243 --> 20:32.946
interviewers come to the campus? Yes. Where were 
the interviews conducted?

20:41.099 --> 20:42.021
I don't really remember. I suppose it was... Could 
have been the library. Any special preparation

20:46.376 --> 20:49.400
that y'all made? No, no. We just signed up for it and 
dressed. I'm sure we put coats and ties on or

20:53.506 --> 20:56.049
uniforms. But one of the questions he asked me I'll 
never forget, of course, is, where would you like

20:57.651 --> 21:07.024
to be if you get this job five years from now? And I 
said, well, I don't know much about the industry,

21:07.124 --> 21:10.989
so I really don't know how to answer. I said, what 
places are there? He described something, and I

21:13.705 --> 21:20.693
said, I think I'd like to be a manager of a design 
function. I don't know. I just never felt

21:21.234 --> 21:24.578
comfortable, I guess. I never thought I felt 
comfortable anyway.

21:31.046 --> 21:31.647
Aggie ring. Did people get their rings then? We got 
our rings. If you qualified with hours to be a

21:38.055 --> 21:43.341
senior and were going into service, you could get 
your rings graduation.

21:47.747 --> 21:48.889
So we did get our rings. I got mine in May of 1945. 
I'll never forget it. Bright and shiny, not bright

21:53.778 --> 21:57.404
and shiny, but dark, brand new. And I remember a few 
periods of weeks that I had it before it went into

21:58.165 --> 22:03.895
service. I wanted it to look old and beat up, so I 
would turn it upside down and hammer it into the

22:05.016 --> 22:10.746
wooden desk. So when the gold would beat up, I 
wouldn't look quite so new. I regretted it later.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.103
And was there pride in Aggie rings then? 
Tremendous. Tremendous pride. It cost us $39,

22:23.167 --> 22:26.491
$36, $39.

22:27.592 --> 22:28.513
Ten carat gold. My son got his. It was ten times as 
much. But that's okay. He got it finally. Let's

22:38.504 --> 22:39.045
see. It helped me, as a matter of fact, while I was in 
service. Oh, good. There was a lieutenant colonel

22:44.527 --> 22:58.320
that was, we were in operations and he was in 
intelligence or some other function at the

22:44.527 --> 22:58.320
headquarters there, and when must retain, that 
was the story I meant to tell, I forgot. Oh, please.

22:59.261 --> 23:04.447
I asked my lieutenant I worked for if I could go talk 
to him. So he said yes, why, and I told him why, and he

23:05.027 --> 23:08.931
said, well, I said, but I'm scared. He said, don't 
be afraid. You have some relationship in a way.

23:16.235 --> 23:18.299
They're human beings too. So I went up there and did 
the usual military salute and asked permission to

23:18.379 --> 23:25.592
speak and asked him if he was going to the muster. He 
said, what do you know about muster? Or something

23:28.897 --> 23:29.999
to that effect. And I said, I'm an Aggie, sir. If 
you'll go with me, I'll go. I said, yes, sir. I'd

23:37.921 --> 23:44.911
like to go and meet some of my classmates that I knew 
had written that were going to be there. So he said,

23:46.393 --> 23:53.524
meet me at some time, a certain hour in the morning, 
and I'll have a staff car there. So I met him. And the

23:55.026 --> 23:58.671
driver we had suited smartly when he came up. And he 
looked at me kind of funny. And I started to get in

24:00.774 --> 24:04.720
the front seat next to the driver, because I was the 
carpenter. PFC, our carpool, and the lieutenant

24:04.987 --> 24:11.214
colonel that most were getting back with me. So we 
went, and I drove in the back with him, and we drove

24:12.235 --> 24:18.141
to the muster and went to the ceremony. And then 
there were two guys that I knew there from my class

24:19.703 --> 24:25.069
that I wanted to stay with, Dwayne Bennett and 
Ellen Gabert. So I went to him before it was, or

24:25.089 --> 24:29.374
after it was over, and asked if I could stay. I'd 
like to stay overnight. We had no orders. He said,

24:33.185 --> 24:39.273
well, if you get in any trouble, just tell them 
there's a verbal officer, commanding officer,

24:33.185 --> 24:39.273
and I'll take care of it. So I stayed. Where was 
this? This was, well, again, I don't remember the

24:41.957 --> 24:44.660
name of this. They had Hamburg, Germany, as I 
remember. But again, I've got, no, I sent the

24:48.506 --> 24:53.412
program to the court center. This would have been 
40, 1946. 46. And so I can't tell you the name of the

24:57.485 --> 25:00.029
city either. I think it was Bad Humburg. Oh, I may 
have a letter from home that can tell me. But any

25:03.435 --> 25:10.266
event, we spent the night there and visited. And he 
went on back. And I don't know how I got, I guess I did

25:12.310 --> 25:14.373
hide back. I don't know how I got back to that. I 
don't fit. After the war on the campus, did you have

25:17.478 --> 25:24.049
the impression that the traditions were stronger 
than they had been? Lister, Bonfire, Silver Taps?

25:29.361 --> 25:32.103
No, I don't think so. There might have been more 
pressure, more feeling of tradition because of

25:32.123 --> 25:41.553
those who'd been in service participated in those 
kinds of events. And I think that probably made a

25:42.414 --> 25:47.479
impression on me, even though I was a lot younger. 
And I'm sure it must have on the others. So I suspect

25:49.901 --> 25:51.943
it probably did have some impact. See, I had the 
impression that World War II was a kind of a special

25:53.054 --> 25:59.863
time in solidifying those. Some of the people that 
I've interviewed can't remember whether muster

26:01.605 --> 26:08.214
was held before the war began or not. They think it 
was, but if so, some of them didn't remember going.

26:11.699 --> 26:16.686
Well, and I think that had a lot to do with the fact 
that I did not go to the first muster. I came to

26:16.706 --> 26:21.492
Houston to see my friend, but I could have come 
after the muster, too. Let's see, another

26:22.906 --> 26:28.152
question somebody told me to ask, did you live in 
Hollywood? And I don't know that term. I don't

26:29.614 --> 26:30.314
either. OK. All right. Running wood and water. I 
don't know that one. Plenty of water through the

26:36.461 --> 26:44.490
drowned outs and fire hoses were turned on my first 
two semesters, first three semesters. Hard

26:44.531 --> 26:48.115
liquors and Uncle Ed, we know about. Uncle Ed's, 
yeah. After the war, was the student body more

26:49.028 --> 26:52.232
diverse? Were there any more Hispanics, Asian 
Americans?

27:00.803 --> 27:09.033
I don't remember whether the influx of 
international students came later or during that

27:00.803 --> 27:09.033
period, not this time. I don't remember. What 
about the academic rigor after the war? My grades

27:13.839 --> 27:17.263
were better, but I think I was just more mature and 
could understand. I mean, the courses I failed, I

27:18.273 --> 27:24.459
failed two courses. Analytical math was the first 
that Ransdell taught. Analytical geometry was

27:28.863 --> 27:32.747
the course he taught, and I couldn't remember. I 
didn't fail that one, but the only two courses I

27:33.087 --> 27:40.514
remember failing were the only semester of 
physics I had to take and that English course.

27:40.635 --> 27:41.555
That's before you went away. That was before the 
war, and I made B's afterwards, which wasn't

27:41.575 --> 27:47.301
great, but they were a hell of a lot better than 
Taylor. Now, in my case, I don't remember we ever

27:47.855 --> 27:52.302
calculated a grade point average. Did y'all? We 
did on a three-point, not a four-point basis. Oh,

27:55.066 --> 27:55.627
that's right. Yes, it was. And so we had to 
interpolate later in order to figure out what ours

27:57.289 --> 28:04.000
was. But we kept the C average, which was a one, or 
better. And it was OK. All right, now we're getting

28:08.426 --> 28:13.474
close to the end and close to the serious 
questions. As you look back, what did you learn at

28:14.635 --> 28:19.822
A&M that's been significant in your life?

28:23.046 --> 28:27.511
I think certainly I grew up and matured between A&M 
and the military. I think it definitely had a

28:29.353 --> 28:36.342
humbling experience for me. Think about my family 
life. My dad had his own business. We lived nicely.

28:46.651 --> 28:47.472
We had cars. My dad had a company car, even in, well, 
everything I can remember. And then my mother had a

28:54.442 --> 28:55.684
car.

28:59.871 --> 29:01.153
They weren't always new cars. One of them, a couple 
of them I remember specifically, we bought from

29:02.695 --> 29:06.040
the doctor. a lot of used cars, but later on they 
became new. 1939, I know we had a new car, no matter

29:11.025 --> 29:13.268
what it did. But we lived nicely, and I didn't have 
that much to be concerned about. So when I got up

29:18.955 --> 29:36.516
there and I did learn that everybody was more 
humble and basically the same, and you treated

29:18.955 --> 29:36.516
everybody the same, and there wasn't any 
difference between one and another, I think I did

29:18.955 --> 29:36.516
learn a lot

29:18.955 --> 29:36.516
there.

29:39.483 --> 29:40.885
qualities of being an Aggie? What does it mean to be 
an Aggie? I think it's being able to meet people, to

29:43.969 --> 30:02.973
converse with them, to recognize that the 
secretary or the warehouseman may someday be as

29:43.969 --> 30:02.973
important as the person you're trying to do 
business with, so you better damn well treat them

29:43.969 --> 30:02.973
right. And certainly if you're in the military, 
you have recognition of the needs and wants and

30:02.993 --> 30:08.140
desires What are

30:09.200 --> 30:25.057
the

30:09.200 --> 30:25.057
factors that contribute most to Aggie spirit, 
feeling? Commonality of attitudes, the fact that

30:25.077 --> 30:34.768
people, at least in those days, and I guess maybe to 
some degree today, but at least in those days,

30:35.339 --> 30:39.122
dressed alike, you didn't know who was who, or what 
was what, or what they had or didn't have. So if they

30:40.564 --> 30:51.434
didn't have it and they worked in the mess hall, and 
some of our friends worked in the mess hall to get

30:40.564 --> 30:51.434
through school, some of them dropped out here and 
there, they worked for a while and came back,

30:40.564 --> 30:51.434
fortunately I didn't have to. But it didn't seem to 
make any difference who they were or what they

30:52.555 --> 30:55.317
were. Pretty much, as far as I was concerned,

30:56.378 --> 31:03.625
everybody felt the same. And as I said before, I 
never felt any religious problems. Not to say they

31:10.838 --> 31:12.321
may not have been there. They probably were.
