WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:06.058
in any particular direction, I mean, not 
petroleum or not. I mean, it's an open ballgame.

00:07.259 --> 00:08.180
Well, no, but that's just one. We've got about 
seven centers out there. And one of the most

00:09.682 --> 00:22.338
important centers that we started, Joe and I 
started back in 1973, was the Center for Growth

00:09.682 --> 00:22.338
Studies, which relates to what's happening to all 
of us from the standpoint of pressure on the

00:09.682 --> 00:22.338
population, environmental things. That's 
everything you've been talking about. Right. And

00:23.860 --> 00:25.442
so therefore, I think it fits. And Joe put it right 
that we've got to change the name. came up the other

00:29.427 --> 00:30.308
day. I don't like to change the name, because we 
looked at the name, and we finally arrived, and we

00:31.368 --> 00:43.724
had Alternative to the Growth, and we had 
Alternative to the Growth Second Session, and we

00:31.368 --> 00:43.724
had, then we hit on the name, the Nature of 
Sustainable Societies. That's what we're trying

00:43.744 --> 00:46.248
to seek, the Nature of Sustainable Societies. 
What is it? You can't make 5 billion people work.

00:49.031 --> 00:50.493
How are you going to make 10 billion people work? 
How's it going to work? How do we get policies to

00:52.616 --> 00:54.098
make it work? I'm just telling you. Yeah, I know. 
Very serious. So, but that does, see, the Center

00:56.581 --> 01:00.987
for Growth Studies doesn't say that. It ought to be 
the Center for Sustainable Society Studies. I

01:05.156 --> 01:05.577
don't know. You see what I'm talking about? God, I 
hate to change that one more time. I hate to change

01:08.640 --> 01:09.161
it. It started out as a women's conference. I know. 
But think about it. Am I right? George Brock

01:13.025 --> 01:14.766
brought that up the other day. I would agree. We've 
never had a really good name. No. Well, think about

01:17.790 --> 01:18.771
it. You and I have worked on things since 1973. But 
see, we've got seven centers out there. We've got

01:25.418 --> 01:28.060
the Accelerator Center, which Peter McIntyre was 
involved in. We've got the supercomputer. We've

01:29.982 --> 01:30.703
got... laser center. We've got seven centers 
there, so it does. And we've got one on energy,

01:33.879 --> 01:37.405
geotechnology, that's doing real good work. And 
we're trying to get a, what we call a clearinghouse

01:37.425 --> 01:44.296
of research that the major company would 
participate with us and the university and DOE.

01:44.857 --> 01:46.560
That's important for this reason. Houston did all 
the, you know, we cover the world with it. It's all

01:49.344 --> 01:50.806
developed in this part of the country. Our 
offshore drilling, our seismic work, everything

01:52.209 --> 01:57.417
was developed in this part of the country here, 
Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston. A little bit to

01:58.038 --> 01:59.440
Oklahoma. I guess there really is no comparable. 
There's nothing comparable. We're going to lose

02:02.284 --> 02:03.706
now. This nation will lose now another 25 years if 
we don't really get reignited again. And we

02:09.954 --> 02:11.256
really, we're not. So we're working on that. 
That'll be one of the geotechnology functions to

02:12.818 --> 02:19.767
try to well the private sector to the university to 
the government sector. And with the talent you

02:20.268 --> 02:21.970
have in this region, to stay ahead of research in 
the world, exploration production research,

02:22.777 --> 02:28.304
and, of course, petrochemicals, too. I'm not 
worried about petrochemicals, but it couldn't go

02:28.765 --> 02:31.168
out. But the universe is so jealous. They want to do 
everything right there in a little thing, and

02:34.172 --> 02:36.596
that's fine. It's very difficult to work with 
them. I'm going to tell you, you know about it

02:38.218 --> 02:41.502
better than I do. But we're making progress. It's 
very tough and pitiful sometimes. You're very

02:45.908 --> 02:46.709
patient. You have to have perseverance to work 
with the universities. But anyway, that gives you

02:51.346 --> 02:58.455
the overall thing, but what we'll do, because we 
can talk some more about a piece of this thing. And

02:59.697 --> 03:06.186
what do you see as growth projections are very 
strong out in the Woodlands area right now, for

02:59.697 --> 03:06.186
example? I think so. And what is this going to do to 
your... What interests me is to really build the

03:06.746 --> 03:18.562
technology center really to the critical mass, I 
think, that this region deserves, including

03:06.746 --> 03:18.562
improving the status of the universities. I could 
foresee... joint appointments with the private

03:20.253 --> 03:33.848
sector that works with us and the universities to 
get the top talent, certainly in petroleum

03:20.253 --> 03:33.848
engineering and geology, which we have some, but 
not the top. Are you getting cooperation in this?

03:36.471 --> 03:41.196
Very difficult because most people think they've 
got enough people to do what I'm talking about

03:36.471 --> 03:41.196
doing. Sure. I would say this in geophysics, you 
mentioned it several times, I think we've got some

03:42.197 --> 03:49.365
good people in the four universities, but not what 
I think we ought to have. And I think the private

03:49.919 --> 03:51.841
sector would help support it. You see, the private 
sector don't want us in it because they stay ahead

03:51.861 --> 03:56.307
of us that way. But in geophysics, I think that we 
can work on that. The private sector really

04:00.011 --> 04:01.994
doesn't know. The major companies, the players 
like we have, we don't have research in

04:02.014 --> 04:07.360
exploration production. He's comparing the 
majors with the independents. You see, the

04:10.624 --> 04:15.410
private sector majors don't want independents 
doing research. They stay ahead of us three years

04:15.630 --> 04:17.473
and they don't want us to catch up. Well, I want to 
catch up. So we're working with the Guest Research

04:21.020 --> 04:23.964
Institute now. They just gave us a grant down 
there. And universities want all that research in

04:26.366 --> 04:28.849
their house. In their house, yeah. So you're 
hearing a very difficult... Except that they

04:32.233 --> 04:36.158
can't get the private sector to relate to them as 
well as they should. Right here is where the action

04:36.178 --> 04:37.480
is. See, if we had a research clearinghouse at the 
private sector that was driven by the private

04:38.741 --> 04:50.976
sector and the university talent was brought into 
it, but the research is driven by the private

04:38.741 --> 04:50.976
sector, they're not going to give Right now, you 
might start at $15 to $20 million in that type of

04:51.749 --> 04:54.392
program. But I'd say in five years, you could build 
it with energy the way the problem's going to be.

04:58.196 --> 05:00.499
You could build up to a $500 million program. It 
would be enormously important for the university

05:00.519 --> 05:03.162
to participate with us. And the private sector 
ought to participate. Because then, right now,

05:04.864 --> 05:09.549
I'll give you a good example that'll blow your 
mind. In clean coal research out of the Department

05:11.532 --> 05:17.338
of Energy, there's now $750 million a year going. 
And non-defense nuclear, $2 billion a year. in oil

05:22.090 --> 05:25.174
and gas research at $34 million a year. Now why? Is 
that right? That's all. Isn't that shocking? That

05:29.339 --> 05:30.861
is shocking. I finally got him to admit. I said, you 
know why? Because your major companies stop at all

05:33.384 --> 05:35.747
times. You're not going to stop the other two. Once 
you wake up and get a share and you do the research,

05:36.849 --> 05:40.333
they put half the money in. So I'm making some 
progress. That's what I'll be doing. Because if

05:43.477 --> 05:49.785
you don't make a major impact in 15, 20 years, if you 
don't get a half billion dollar project in five

05:43.477 --> 05:49.785
years, you're not going to do any good. But then in 
the university, you could have joint tenure. You

05:52.617 --> 05:53.699
could have them involved. You could have the 
private sector involved. But they don't trust the

05:55.381 --> 05:59.488
university or DOE to do a half a billion dollar 
research project. No major companies. So they'll

06:01.191 --> 06:02.092
never get it. Now, that doesn't stop them from 
doing the most basic work that they should do. But

06:06.520 --> 06:11.789
when you're trying to get the stuff that goes to the 
private sector, you better have the private

06:06.520 --> 06:11.789
sector involved. Now, that's what I'm trying to 
convince them, and it ought to be in Houston. Do you

06:15.280 --> 06:22.529
think there's been much real transfusion, let's 
say, of new technology into the petroleum

06:15.280 --> 06:22.529
industry in the last decade or so? Yeah, I think 
there's some. I think there's some. But I think we

06:24.692 --> 06:34.465
find by these venture capital that we have put 
together, the most difficult thing is to get

06:24.692 --> 06:34.465
anything out of the universities that makes 
sense. Now, I think that if we could help them

06:35.226 --> 06:41.133
devise a program, we could help them make sense. 
Well, are you telling me in a way that the American

06:41.153 --> 06:44.798
petroleum industry is in very much the same 
situation They, let's say, as the American iron

06:45.301 --> 06:49.406
and steel industry was 50 years ago. Yeah, I can say 
the major presence were Neanderthals. Yeah, and

06:53.252 --> 06:55.014
that's what happened to iron and steel. It's 
obvious from their PR relation. They should have

06:56.536 --> 06:57.758
had Joe on their staff. We got a good PR thanks to Joe 
and his effort the last 20 years. They got a

07:01.823 --> 07:02.884
horrible PR. Why? When they didn't have enough 
perception that when the gas oil price went up to

07:05.268 --> 07:14.700
stop many gas prices as much as they could from 
going up and let people know what they're trying to

07:05.268 --> 07:14.700
do, they're stupid. Now we're going to have three 
hearings on gouging and none on what we're going to

07:15.862 --> 07:19.576
do about sovereign energy. Let me just tell you. So 
I would say that why I'm so adamant on that

07:21.122 --> 07:26.783
research, and I think they're wrong,

07:53.543 --> 07:57.269
It's a billion-dollar research on exploration 
and production research. That's, of course, the

07:57.329 --> 07:59.312
exploration end. So I put a simple pencil to it. The 
gross revenues they get out of production,

08:04.299 --> 08:11.109
exploration production, is $150 billion. Now, to 
spend only a billion, there's something wrong

08:12.111 --> 08:14.655
with them. You see what I'm talking about? Yep. 
They ought to be spending $4 or $5 billion a year, at

08:18.080 --> 08:20.884
least. him spend seven percent of the gross income 
etc they've been in the dark ages too long now they

08:21.640 --> 08:50.382
think they got all the bases covered yeah that does 
sound like iron and steel yeah really i hadn't even

08:21.640 --> 08:50.382
thought about that i've never made that 
connection yet they've been so smart for the last

08:21.640 --> 08:50.382
30 40 years mainly because they're chased by a 10 
000 independence they've covered the world then

08:21.640 --> 08:50.382
they won't let us produce it but i think that 
they're losing out in this country yeah and i think

08:21.640 --> 08:50.382
that we've got to fire them up it ought to be in 
houston so that's where used to advance research

08:50.952 --> 09:17.213
and then you're working our problem is 
universities oh no i want it over here and fisher

08:50.952 --> 09:17.213
said he wants it in austin and ufa says i want over 
here you know sure so i've got to kind of be uh

08:50.952 --> 09:17.213
working with them make them all say we're going to 
all benefit by it let's see what we can do well i know

08:50.952 --> 09:17.213
it's silly to ask you if you're optimistic because 
obviously you are but what do you see as the next

08:50.952 --> 09:17.213
great hurdle or breakthrough or obstacle that 
you've got to surmount in terms of developing that

09:18.408 --> 09:20.770
complex. You mean in the woodlands? In the 
woodlands. I think it's important that the

09:22.652 --> 09:32.483
commercial and the high tech thing begins to 
become as effective and really as aggressive as

09:22.652 --> 09:32.483
we're doing in the residential. Very good. Yes. 
But right now, because of Houston's problems, and

09:34.665 --> 09:42.373
I'd say that the west side beat us with a draw on the 
energy corridor. We got some out there, but not as

09:42.393 --> 09:44.516
much as the west side. But we got this airport. And 
there's no way to expand at any other airport. So

09:49.636 --> 09:51.118
we're going to be riding a driver. We've got a toll 
road, as you know. Yeah, I use it every week almost.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.487
And it didn't end up with the Woodlands by 
accident. A lot of work went by. How about rail, the

09:58.609 --> 10:00.692
monorail or whatever? Working on rail is a 
possibility. We got one like Kit Lanier. I've done

10:06.120 --> 10:06.861
it before. They spent $65 million. He was the head 
of the MTA here for a while. I kid him. I said, you

10:12.548 --> 10:14.570
know, you spent $65 million. I've only spent six 
rounds down. I've got a train going to Dallas right

10:16.092 --> 10:18.315
now. Why do I have them? You've got something 
going. However, we think that rail could be a

10:22.259 --> 10:26.905
possibility to the women and further out. So I 
think that, you know, those are the things that get

10:27.646 --> 10:39.380
along because you need to get people into the big 
city and have all the downtown be a main downtown

10:27.646 --> 10:39.380
and have all the cultural centers or most of it 
here, et cetera, et cetera, legal professional.

10:39.801 --> 10:40.862
We have to be part of the whole. And we should 
develop. They should never put the summit out

10:42.217 --> 10:44.320
there where they did. The summit should be in here. 
This area should be really the Brown Center. You

10:49.587 --> 10:51.430
still have to have that hub here. But then you have 
to have these employment areas and commercial

10:52.391 --> 10:58.219
areas and nodes around. And then where you all hold 
one of the hope. Because if you're a separate

11:02.344 --> 11:05.128
community out there, it won't work. And when you 
economically integrate that community, you

11:06.712 --> 11:13.860
still anticipate that a substantial core of that 
group actually will come downtown. In other

11:13.880 --> 11:14.841
words, this is the mixing bowl. Well, I think in 
some functions they should come downtown, if you

11:14.861 --> 11:18.225
have good transit. How do you compare, 
incidentally, the Dallas economic region to

11:18.425 --> 11:23.550
Houston? Dallas has more defense, and they're 
aggressive. They've got a good bunch of people

11:25.853 --> 11:28.676
working in Dallas, Perot and all that bunch. But 
see, Dallas made a mistake not taking advantage of

11:29.037 --> 11:33.141
the exterritorial jurisdictions. They got a lot 
of independent subdivisions around Dallas.

11:36.774 --> 11:37.755
Terribly independent, yeah. They were in 
trouble. They were in trouble because of Plano, et

11:38.836 --> 11:42.561
cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So Dallas really 
made a mistake not doing what we're trying to do. I

11:46.486 --> 11:49.590
had to fight Kathy Whitmire, not fight her, but 
first month in office. I told her, I need that rail

11:49.610 --> 11:52.434
from the north to get to the new airport. How are you 
going to get to the airport in five years, Kathy?

11:54.577 --> 11:56.018
You're building a billion-hour airport and you 
can't get there. That's right. She wouldn't do it.

11:57.460 --> 11:58.281
She wouldn't do it the whole world. I said, the 
second thing is you came on for the city and you came

11:59.142 --> 12:03.448
on the premise that she would have Clear Lake City 
DNX from Houston. She's so thankful that she

12:09.353 --> 12:12.037
didn't get it done. I argued with her, and she was 
still going to try to do it, and we got it beat.

12:15.582 --> 12:23.314
Because if Clear Lake City and NASA had been DNXed 
from Houston, it would have been a divorce. That's

12:23.334 --> 12:24.857
an example I'm using for Kathy. She won't admit it 
now, but she was dead against it. She wanted DNXed.

12:28.743 --> 12:30.786
That was what she wrote right on the platform. I 
said, those are two things you're really wrong,

12:31.222 --> 12:33.265
Captain. She won't listen. She listens now. She's 
really brightened. She made a hell of a plea for

12:37.069 --> 12:43.578
Japan's service today, talking about it at the 
Houston Partnership meeting. She's really

12:44.319 --> 12:49.665
gotten where she worked for the private sector, 
but she was so suspicious of them at the beginning

12:44.319 --> 12:49.665
that she thought it was just all self-interest. 
But she's the bright gal. She's done a good job.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.271
What's happening in Texas? I think the war is going 
to make Texas much better. I think the price is not

12:58.222 --> 13:02.708
going to go back to $10 or $12 again for long ever, I 
don't think. For the next 10 years, I think that

13:03.008 --> 13:09.497
it's bad for the nation, and I think that our 
economy should be better, particularly Houston.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.440
And we'll just see when gas prices go low. This one 
gas price is going. That's the thing it was, but now

13:13.722 --> 13:15.645
gas prices are low. But the bubble on coal-seamed 
gas bothers me a little bit. I'm not so sure. Say

13:20.972 --> 13:21.432
that again. Coal-seamed gas is coming in strong. 
And it's a concern as to whether the bubble's going

13:23.973 --> 13:27.597
to be gone this winter for the normal winter or not. 
I think it will be. But the price of gas will go up

13:28.478 --> 13:33.003
anyway because oil is going to go up. I was serious 
when I first walked in. Is there a relationship?

13:35.485 --> 13:44.234
For example, when you started the Woodlands, the 
real housing development, we had the OPEC embargo

13:35.485 --> 13:44.234
and so forth. And you had a tough time selling, 
probably. Very tough time. Do you see that

13:46.357 --> 13:47.378
happening again? The interest rates went up to 
14%, 15%. And everything, inflation got out of

13:50.011 --> 13:51.854
control. It really hurt us. That was the key to it. 
That hurt us. The inflation got out of control. It

13:55.819 --> 13:57.862
may not get out of control, but it might get out of 
control. So if prices can go up and interest rates

13:58.123 --> 14:02.569
stay down, you're fixed. It came in 35% over 
budget, and that hurt us. Yeah. And that's because

14:05.454 --> 14:07.617
inflation just gnawed us to pieces. Also, I think 
that the fact that we're going so fast, we probably

14:08.358 --> 14:15.909
should have figured out how to make it more 
palatable. Mm-hmm. But, Henry, you're going to be

14:16.758 --> 14:18.981
allowed to come back. All right. I don't know what 
your schedule is, but I don't know when it's here.

14:23.448 --> 14:27.234
Yeah, well, we'll have more time to talk about it in 
the future. Okay, good. We'll stop right here.
