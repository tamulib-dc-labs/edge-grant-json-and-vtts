WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:15.559
They later moved to the North Gate area and 
occupied a building that had been moved from

00:02.900 --> 00:15.559
Victoria Air Force Base, a chapel from that base. 
The other First Baptist Church was at the North

00:16.265 --> 00:24.936
Gate, A&M Methodist Church, St. Mary's Catholic 
Church. Later churches came in were Church of

00:25.858 --> 00:36.812
Christ, and most of those have relocated from the 
North Gate area. Did your family, were they church

00:37.893 --> 00:39.876
attenders? My father at the First Baptist Church 
was on the board of trustees there. They

00:47.344 --> 00:57.699
originally organized from a building on the 
campus and met, I believe, in the E.E. building

01:00.083 --> 01:04.870
lecture room and then later moved off to the 
campus. Reverend R.L. Brown was the first member.

01:07.514 --> 01:20.673
pastor of that church and he would come by and see 
Papa for church activities while we lived on the

01:07.514 --> 01:20.673
campus there. Now I'm guessing that during that 
era most of the campus families were mainline

01:26.532 --> 01:28.554
Protestants. Is that? I would, I'm trying to, and 
I'm going to say I know a number of Baptist families

01:32.478 --> 01:45.591
that went to church in Bryan at First Baptist 
Church. And I guess, and there were a number of

01:47.173 --> 01:53.679
Methodists. The Episcopal Church was not 
organized. It later was organized and had a chapel

01:58.338 --> 02:06.670
across from Duncan Field on Jersey Street. George 
Bush. George Bush Drive. And there was a big

02:10.515 --> 02:22.273
delegation of Catholic students, though, that 
were served through St. Joseph Church in Bryan.

02:22.633 --> 02:23.995
And then St. Mary's. Where was that? St. Mary's. Do 
you remember during those growing up years any

02:26.178 --> 02:33.732
Jewish member of the faculty or staff? Yes, sir. 
Mr. Halperin in the math department was a little

02:36.376 --> 02:43.249
man. And I believe he was Jewish. So I presume then 
he went all the way to Bryan to worship. He must have

02:51.590 --> 02:59.417
because they had, well, later they did have the 
Hillel Foundation south of campus. But at that

03:00.098 --> 03:02.140
time when I was growing up, they didn't have it. Do 
you by chance remember any

03:02.180 --> 03:09.306
comparatively outspoken non-believer? Was 
there any?

03:13.739 --> 03:27.116
What I'm assuming is that in that era, religion was 
one of the comparative normal parts of the routine

03:13.739 --> 03:27.116
of the campus. Of campus life, that's true. No, 
sir, I really don't. You know, Mr. Cashin was head

03:32.483 --> 03:35.427
of the YMCA. M.L. Cashin was a first secretary that 
I remember, and then Mr. Gay followed him. Gordon

03:43.630 --> 03:44.272
Gay. Please describe your memory of Mr. Cashin. He 
was a fine gentleman. He was known as a true

03:49.965 --> 03:56.200
believer. And one of the stories about Red Cashin 
is he asked his daddy, why did you always pray for

03:57.260 --> 04:06.232
A&M after every prayer you read from here at home? 
Getting mixed up, you know, all men with A&M.

04:13.702 --> 04:17.888
Now the Cashin boys, are they your 
contemporaries? Jimmy is

04:19.330 --> 04:26.119
three or four years younger than I am, and Mason 
must be about 10 years younger, something like

04:27.837 --> 04:33.882
that. All right, now, you called him Mason. Mason 
Lee. Yes. That was what ML called Red. When did he

04:41.048 --> 04:43.170
become known as Red? Well, he was always 
red-headed. I know. So as a little bitty? Yeah, as a

04:49.615 --> 04:51.417
kid, he was Red. Did you have a nickname? Uh, D.B., 
uh... And then Dusty Butt got fitted because of our

04:58.938 --> 05:04.005
stature. That was Papa's nickname. And I assumed 
that, but outside of that. All right. Did your dad,

05:10.895 --> 05:25.095
somebody told me that they thought sometimes when 
he would erase the board, he would unconsciously

05:10.895 --> 05:25.095
kind of rub his hand on the side of his trousers and 
maybe get a little chalk dust. Yeah. ah i don't i

05:27.203 --> 05:50.663
don't recall that no i really don't but i do recall 
one professor that i had and that was when i went to a

05:27.203 --> 05:50.663
m and that was mr bob lyle in the math department 
that he would come in neatly dressed with the tie

05:27.203 --> 05:50.663
and shirt and then he would start writing on the 
board and by the time the session was over his tie

05:50.913 --> 06:13.815
would be down and chalk dust would be all over him 
and the board would be full did he have a nickname i

05:50.913 --> 06:13.815
don't think so but he was he was a good teacher yes 
ma'am

05:50.913 --> 06:13.815
let's go back to elementary school Were there any 
important extracurricular activities that you

06:14.217 --> 06:20.945
remember from your elementary school days? The 
extracurricular activities centered around

06:22.307 --> 06:31.117
what we called the Interscholastic League County 
Meets. Declamation contests,

06:33.560 --> 06:40.208
softball, track, They were the spring event, 
actually. Now, this was in addition to organized

06:45.865 --> 06:53.392
football and basketball. It didn't go, it wasn't 
near the program that there is today. It was on an

06:57.917 --> 07:08.367
interscholastic league meet where all of the 
county schools would have a meet at a certain place

06:57.917 --> 07:08.367
and they would have competitions. And I remember 
specifically that I would participate in

07:10.546 --> 07:14.572
declamation contests. And one of my main 
adversaries was John Lawrence III in Bryan. And we

07:21.924 --> 07:26.170
met numerous times at those particular meets. 
Were there many associations between you

07:26.711 --> 07:31.839
elementary college station kids and the Bryan 
kids? Yes. We would go to the same dances.

07:39.115 --> 07:42.539
We were known as a crowd. That meant your age group 
was a crowd. And Bryan College Station would go

07:46.184 --> 07:50.089
together. Surely would. Of course, the main 
activity would be in Bryan. But we would have

07:54.775 --> 07:56.638
dances. And we would attend. And the College 
Station group was included. And in Bryan were

08:02.986 --> 08:07.131
included also some College Station dancers. All 
right, still in the elementary years, where did

08:07.297 --> 08:11.844
your mom do her grocery shopping? At Luke and 
Charlie's at the North Gate, which you could walk

08:12.305 --> 08:24.944
out of our back door and walk across the railroad 
and the street, and you could go get a loaf of bread

08:12.305 --> 08:24.944
if it was needed. But that was the main. And then 
there was also a community grocery store on

08:26.687 --> 08:34.198
campus.

08:34.803 --> 08:38.608
But it actually, it had delivery. And one of the 
delivery men was named Graves, and at one time he

08:40.611 --> 08:51.966
drove a little horse-drawn wagon. Did the college 
operate that community store? It was operated by

08:57.834 --> 09:00.678
someone else. I don't think it was operated 
directly by the college. But the college did have

09:03.946 --> 09:12.380
milk delivery in the morning from the F&B station. 
And then the creamery also had dairy products. But

09:20.568 --> 09:26.676
we did shop in, I mean grocery shopping was at the 
North Gate. Let's see, did your, your family had a

09:28.378 --> 09:33.144
car as your memory begins? We didn't have a car 
until 1935 or so and we used the

09:46.690 --> 09:53.376
Bryan College Station, what did they call that 
traction company? The trolley? It was the trolley

09:54.657 --> 10:00.402
first and then it later became a bus line after the 
trolley went out. Was the trolley within your

10:01.022 --> 10:04.145
memory or had it stopped? I remember riding it on 
occasion vividly, but I know where the station was

10:04.505 --> 10:15.735
behind the chapel, the campus chapel. now and it 
entered not far from us where we live down at the but

10:16.036 --> 10:36.407
where the mr. boy it's house was on the corner there 
where the campus can't think of that theater uh

10:36.758 --> 11:01.821
movie was and that it came onto the campus then and 
rode around about to the chapel but uh i'm more

10:36.758 --> 11:01.821
memory of the uh bus lines about how frequently did 
the on the hours on the hour do you remember what

10:36.758 --> 11:01.821
what the fair was something like uh 25 cents round 
trip, 10 or 15 cents one way, something like that.

11:08.366 --> 11:10.288
And downtown Bryan was a busy place. Absolutely. 
That was the center of business activity, you see,

11:12.570 --> 11:17.694
in most of the stores. The bus line went to just a 
block from Main Street at the old, well, the Eagle

11:20.076 --> 11:32.567
Building at one time was there as the newest thing 
closest to it. And it was just on, I forgot the name

11:33.138 --> 11:40.765
of it, but it was just a block from Main Street. 
Describe during the pre-World War II days, in the

11:41.946 --> 11:50.315
late 30s, describe downtown Bryan on a Saturday 
afternoon. Quite busy. The movies were, it had

11:52.056 --> 11:54.178
three movies. They had the Queen, the Dixie, and 
the Palace. All right there in one block, two on one

12:00.880 --> 12:04.844
side of the street and one on the other. And it was 
quite a place. Most students would go to town at

12:07.627 --> 12:14.013
that time in shock. And everybody, all local 
citizens as well, would go. I remember one thing,

12:17.997 --> 12:24.244
Allen Academy would not go to town on Saturday. 
That's why they gave those students off on Monday.

12:28.218 --> 12:31.223
when nobody was downtown because it was so busy. 
They would permit, they would give their students

12:31.824 --> 12:41.679
Monday off instead of Saturday to prevent any kind 
of conflict or anything like that. And it was more

12:42.500 --> 12:46.726
advantageous for them because there were fewer 
folks. What was the five and ten cent downtown?

12:53.617 --> 12:54.078
F.W. Woolworth and Perry Brothers. And of course, 
Woolworth later became in the center block there.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.502
But of course, it's been closed for a number of 
years. Menswear? A&M Waldrop. A&M Waldrop and

13:13.949 --> 13:15.371
Company. They had a college store and a brine 
store. Waldrop sold uniforms primarily out at

13:19.923 --> 13:26.911
college, and they were at the North Gate. And then 
they had the downtown store was their main store.

13:32.337 --> 13:32.998
Ladieswear.

13:36.301 --> 13:41.527
As I recall, the first ladieswear was the Smart 
Shop.

13:44.751 --> 13:48.715
That was...

13:51.074 --> 13:57.961
I can't think of who organized that, but that was 
the first ladies ready to wear. And then there was

13:58.361 --> 14:01.624
Eugene Edge on the corner. And

14:02.245 --> 14:11.174
if a family went out to eat, where would they go? 
They would primarily go to the Aggieland Inn,

14:11.194 --> 14:17.740
which was on the campus and had a nice restaurant, 
cafe, because it was run by the mess hall. And that

14:22.380 --> 14:26.927
would be a place you could go to eat. Now, as your 
memory begins, was Mr. Duncan in charge of food?

14:32.977 --> 14:33.358
The mess hall. Describe him. He was a very 
impressive-looking gentleman, gray-haired,

14:42.982 --> 15:02.982
And I remember him, I guess, primarily as being a 
devoted mason, and on certain occasions he would

14:42.982 --> 15:02.982
put his Knight Templar uniform on and go to Bryan 
for communications. The

15:02.962 --> 15:12.858
Sebesa Dining Hall was a center not only of eating 
but of social events I know. Did you and your family

15:13.459 --> 15:18.247
ever eat at Sebesa when you were in high school? 
Only on special occasions there would be, but I

15:19.729 --> 15:26.640
don't recall any until after I went to A&M. All 
right, back to your elementary days. Are there

15:32.092 --> 15:39.462
some teachers that you would like to mention and 
express your gratitude for them? Yes, I remember

15:39.522 --> 15:57.167
one in particular, Mrs. Henrietta C. Doak, Dr. 
Doak's wife, who lived on campus with the Boltons,

15:39.522 --> 15:57.167
which was just walking distance to grammar 
school. She taught me in the seventh grade and was

15:59.077 --> 16:06.390
an excellent teacher. She later had the 
opportunity to teach my children at Sol Ross

16:07.692 --> 16:18.852
Elementary School in Bryan after she had retired 
once from Consolidated. And had gone to Snook, I

16:19.996 --> 16:25.942
think, and retired there, and then had come back to 
teaching. She was a long-time teacher. And Dr.

16:27.684 --> 16:33.330
Doak was head of the biology department. And we 
lived in the same area with them in South Oakwood.

16:41.638 --> 16:48.906
And I remember he was a great gardener and would 
give us some of his of production. We enjoyed that.

16:53.505 --> 16:54.967
But she was a fine teacher. Then another high 
school teacher was Mrs. Ethel Walton Burgess. She

17:05.520 --> 17:16.935
taught English and she was, I had a very hard time 
getting a acceptable grade at home in English. But

17:18.333 --> 17:22.999
she was a good teacher.

17:23.399 --> 17:25.462
You had a built-in English teacher. I had one. It 
was always looking over my shoulder, but she was

17:27.264 --> 17:31.409
very good. She taught English in high school for 
any number of years. In high school, describe that

17:37.536 --> 17:46.467
A&M Consolidated High School in your four years.

17:49.433 --> 18:18.006
As I recall, when

17:49.433 --> 18:18.006
I went to high school in 35, 36, the superintendent

17:49.433 --> 18:18.006
was Mr. James H. Sykes, who

17:49.433 --> 18:18.006
was elated over the fact that he had hired two 
recent graduates from Southwestern University.

18:22.449 --> 18:23.551
One was I.D. Hoke and the other one was Thomas 
Ferguson. To come, Mr. Hoke taught social studies

18:28.499 --> 18:36.571
and Mr. Ferguson taught science. And I think, and 
they were to inaugurate a football team. And I

18:46.775 --> 18:58.468
think the first team played about four games, and 
then later it gradually increased as the years

18:46.775 --> 18:58.468
progressed. And Mr. Hope left someplace, and Mr. 
Ferguson later became on the faculty at A&M. One

19:09.260 --> 19:15.347
other teacher that I recall was Caroline 
Mitchell, who taught math, in in high school and

19:15.985 --> 19:36.492
she was an excellent teacher now this is jw 
mitchell's daughter this is the caroline

19:15.985 --> 19:36.492
mitchell that you and i both knew and she worked in 
the registrar's office describe her please as a

19:15.985 --> 19:36.492
teacher her personality she was the most patient 
person you ever saw and she was an excellent

19:37.298 --> 20:02.175
teacher and she would explain it and then if you 
uh... grasp it and reported it to back to her she

19:37.298 --> 20:02.175
would qualify you she was an excellent teacher as 
well as Mr. Mitchell he was known for his uh... math

19:37.298 --> 20:02.175
contest when he was in A&M among the students he 
uh... inaugurated he called them in honor of mr.

20:02.712 --> 20:25.193
they called him mr. Bobby Smith a famous math 
teacher at A&M and he would have these calculus

20:02.712 --> 20:25.193
contests and all and they would award watches and 
to the winners and all, and he would coach those

20:25.730 --> 20:31.160
students. And he started that at A&M. That was Mr. 
Mitchell. Well, Caroline later

20:33.764 --> 20:43.401
taught at other schools in the state and then came 
back to A&M as the academic advisor for the

20:45.203 --> 20:50.588
transfer students, something like that. In those 
four high school years, as you recall, what kind of

20:50.608 --> 20:58.936
mathematics courses did you all take? We had 
Algebra I, II, Plain Geometry, and then senior

20:58.956 --> 21:06.844
year, Solid Geometry and Trigonometry. That's 
exactly what I had. Those were the courses. And

21:10.367 --> 21:13.270
what sciences? general science, biology for the 
first two years. And then if you were really

21:18.411 --> 21:22.585
inclined, you could take physics. junior and 
senior, or junior or senior. And as I recall, our

21:28.589 --> 21:39.192
physics class had opportunity to go adjacent to 
the physics building on campus to use the

21:28.589 --> 21:39.192
laboratory. What about chemistry? No chemistry 
was taught. No chemistry. And with your father

21:44.283 --> 21:49.891
being an English teacher, what English courses do 
you, how much? We had four years of English. One,

21:53.756 --> 21:57.000
two, and, well, four. So that by and large, 
everybody at A&M Consolidated High School then

21:57.721 --> 22:08.316
took what we would now call a college prep 
curriculum. Exactly. Sixteen credits were

22:09.618 --> 22:18.746
required for entrance to A&M or any other state 
school, I think. Now, if you and any of your buddies

22:18.766 --> 22:27.954
were wanting to create some mischief when you were 
in high school, what would that consist of? Maybe

22:29.416 --> 22:32.018
rolling the trash can down the stairs. That was 
done on numerous occasions because we had Stairs,

22:38.317 --> 22:43.547
no elevators, and it was just a two-story building 
and a big trash can and all. But there wasn't really

22:43.908 --> 22:46.273
a great deal of that. Do you remember anybody, any 
of the high school kids attempting to smoke? Oh, I

22:52.104 --> 22:54.008
think that, oh, they had access. Well, I remember I 
had an occasion, too, when... some of these rural

22:57.419 --> 23:05.113
children introduced me at the Christmas tree to 
chewing tobacco. It was quite an occasion. It was

23:09.160 --> 23:12.325
remembered and never tried again. Did your 
stomach reject? It did. That's a terrible

23:16.713 --> 23:18.516
feeling. As far as you recall, what were the either 
clearly defined or clearly not defined but

23:18.952 --> 23:31.209
clearly understood rules of conduct that you got 
from your parents?

23:34.073 --> 23:39.461
Well, the rule at home was you observe student. And 
if you got in trouble at school while you had a

23:47.318 --> 24:06.981
second opportunity

23:47.318 --> 24:06.981
to redeem yourself, if you want to call it that, but 
it also meant you had second punishment if you had

23:47.318 --> 24:06.981
to stay in school for whatever reason at all, 
otherwise you had to answer then to the family

23:47.318 --> 24:06.981
situation. Where in those years, where did 
someone get an alcoholic drink in Brazos County?

24:19.313 --> 24:27.834
In those years, as I recall, the closest to A&M were 
two places. There was Uncle Ed Hardlicker on

24:28.777 --> 24:34.150
Weldon Road. who naturally made, believe it or 
not, once he said, believe it or not, Ed Hardaker,

24:35.902 --> 24:44.879
College Station, Texas, sells soft drinks. But at 
the East Gate was, there was a cafe over there that

24:46.522 --> 24:56.602
had beer. Of course, that came in during First 
administration between 32 to 36, something like

24:59.982 --> 25:05.067
that. Now, the county was dry for whiskey, and you 
would have to go across to Burleson County to buy

25:05.708 --> 25:17.339
anything. In that era, was it called Whiskey 
Bridge? Whiskey Bridge was out 60, as I recall, and

25:20.783 --> 25:28.150
a little store just across the river there. But was 
it called that then? It was. It was a bridge and

25:31.754 --> 25:33.027
then... There was another one across Highway 21. 
And I've forgotten the name of that. Avalon. That

25:44.941 --> 25:46.323
was the Avalon Club. I think they had package 
stores out there. And then later, the Smetana

25:50.168 --> 25:57.039
Precinct in Brazos County was one of the first to go 
wet. And then naturally, it increased. The whole

26:01.846 --> 26:04.330
county became. All right, let's go back to 
football. You mentioned that football started

26:07.159 --> 26:12.615
when you were in ninth, 10th grade? The 8th grade, 
9th, 10th, 11th were our four senior years. So I

26:20.203 --> 26:27.596
think it started that year or the next year, but as I 
recall it was in 36 or 37. And where did you all play

26:28.838 --> 26:34.669
your Kyle Field practice field? Not the main 
field, but the practice field. They would permit

26:37.013 --> 26:39.099
us to go down there. What about baseball and 
basketball games? Where were they played?

26:44.132 --> 26:51.833
Basketball games from high school were played in 
the little gym that they called, it was a big wooden

26:52.640 --> 27:01.990
gym and then sometimes for the bigger games they 
would get the main floor in the old DeWare Field

26:52.640 --> 27:01.990
House. But there used to be a little gym next where 
the swimming pool is and of course that's gone now.

27:10.440 --> 27:19.930
There was a wooden gymnasium there that had 
handball courts and a wooden floor, I mean a

27:10.440 --> 27:19.930
basketball court too. And we would go down there 
because it was usually open. They couldn't very

27:24.038 --> 27:25.540
well close it. And one of our favorite pastimes was 
playing on that wooden floor what we called Tin Can

27:27.123 --> 27:37.963
Shinny on roller skates. It's kind of a modified 
hockey game. Mm-hmm. And Mr. Ashford, who was in

27:41.324 --> 27:56.785
charge of the athletic facilities there, would 
come in one door and we would go out the other door

27:41.324 --> 27:56.785
when he wanted to terminate our activities. Where 
did you and your buddies go swimming? Go where?

28:01.358 --> 28:02.099
Swimming. There was a swimming pool in the old YMCA 
building, in the basement there before it became a

28:02.419 --> 28:09.429
bowling alley. There was a swimming pool there 
before they had the main swimming pool at... P.L.

28:18.641 --> 28:18.942
Downs. P.L. Downs, an auditorium there. We would 
go to that YMCA building, all right now let's move

28:25.604 --> 28:51.544
you up to college do you recall there ever being any 
doubt as to where you would go to college no doubt

28:25.604 --> 28:51.544
whatsoever the only doubt i had was would i be able 
to make the grades that first semester and that was

28:25.604 --> 28:51.544
my main concern because i knew where i would go and 
of course it in those times uh The, on the horizon

28:52.840 --> 29:00.831
was war and all and you just, that's where you would 
go to school. Where did you, where did you live as a

29:01.632 --> 29:04.577
student? I lived at home part of the time and then 
towards the junior year while I went to the

29:05.278 --> 29:12.628
dormitory and lived in the dormitory. Right. 
Please describe what it was like to be a home

29:13.830 --> 29:21.160
residing freshman in the Corps. Well, I had a lot of 
friends. I made friends because I took liberal

29:24.451 --> 29:36.225
arts, and there was a core of us liberal arts 
students. That means pre-law students or

29:36.285 --> 29:43.553
economics majors or things like that because you 
had no business school or anything like that.

29:43.921 --> 29:56.867
Well, you did have the Agriculture 
Administration, but I made friends my first

29:43.921 --> 29:56.867
semester, and I was always, I enjoyed inviting 
them over to the house, and we'd study. around the

29:57.353 --> 30:03.743
dining room table for a quiz, a letter quiz or a 
final quiz. And I made lots of contacts in that I

30:04.625 --> 30:14.721
maintain and still know many of those fellows 
today. So you enrolled as a freshman in the fall of

30:14.701 --> 30:17.406
39. 39.

30:20.974 --> 30:26.525
So you're enrolling as a freshman as the war is 
beginning in Europe. Correct. The, now I'm

30:28.669 --> 30:30.533
assuming, that with your father looking over your 
shoulder, that you had no grade troubles,

30:30.513 --> 30:45.113
did anybody ever give you, any sophomore or junior 
or senior, ever give you a hard time because you

30:30.513 --> 30:45.113
were a faculty brat? No, I don't recall it. They 
would pump me for information quite a bit, and I was

30:47.870 --> 31:03.895
fairly well accepted, and I would take some 
fatherless...
