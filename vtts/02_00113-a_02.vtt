WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:07.800
maybe Schulenburg or somewhere in that area and 
actually he I think he carpentered for a year or so

00:07.780 --> 00:12.440
before he came in and went to college here at A&M and 
so he he ran his his department somewhat he ran his

00:12.420 --> 00:19.720
department different I tried to run mine by 
setting example and having people do try to do what

00:25.800 --> 00:34.230
I was doing by example he ran his kind of like you'd 
run the army and he had him jumping around pretty

00:34.210 --> 00:39.560
now the nickname for him was mom Samang yeah well 
that was with the students yes they referred to him

00:39.540 --> 00:44.700
as mom Samang I'm not sure I guess he took pretty 
good care of the students dr. Lindsay used to just

00:48.580 --> 00:53.700
spend his time all time with students helping them 
with degree program and I think that's a real

00:53.680 --> 00:56.140
important thing to do and I think today they've got 
one of our problems is we've got people helping

00:59.660 --> 01:03.940
students a degree program don't even know never 
took some of the courses and really don't have we

01:03.920 --> 01:09.380
don't then that's one of the most important 
features you're dealing with people's lives and

01:09.360 --> 01:12.340
this is where we ought to have I had old dr. Harris 
and he had the patience of job helping those people

01:16.700 --> 01:22.300
WD Harris in in chemical engineering he I put him in 
charge of that instead of my doing it I put him in

01:22.280 --> 01:25.380
charge of because he had more patience than I did 
you and dr. Lindsay came by one day and he says

01:25.360 --> 01:30.950
Charles I want to congratulate you you finally put 
Don Harris to work I never could get him to work like

01:30.930 --> 01:38.130
that and he came over there and old Don was in there 
just taking his time there's a whole line of

01:42.070 --> 01:45.370
students out there waiting for him but he treated 
every one of them and gave him his very best opinion

01:45.350 --> 01:51.210
and if you've got a kid in school you surely 
appreciate somebody like that all right in those

01:51.190 --> 01:55.990
years in for an undergraduate in chemical 
engineering what were the key courses key

02:01.430 --> 02:05.710
undergraduate courses for those students oh they 
took unit operations and thermodynamics much the

02:05.690 --> 02:10.250
same as taken now it really these fundamental 
things really don't change all that much and we got

02:10.230 --> 02:17.310
we introduced process control after in early 
fifties that was introduced by bleed GL fair then

02:17.290 --> 02:23.990
we in that group also introduced chemical 
engineering ultras say program engineering and

02:23.970 --> 02:25.830
it kind of Kinetics and Catalysis, one of the first 
schools in the country to do that. And so ours got

02:30.230 --> 02:35.250
those, they had Unit Operations Laboratory and so 
on. Unit Ops was one of them that they used a lot. Dr.

02:37.410 --> 02:44.410
Lindsay taught a course in organic chemistry, and 
he kind of waited, he kind of threw the grades and

02:44.390 --> 02:49.650
let, threw the papers and let the step they landed 
on determine the grade. That's kind of, and some of

02:49.630 --> 02:54.370
them would really complain because he also looked 
and see which student needed the grade, helped him

02:54.350 --> 03:00.470
determine it was. According to the students, what 
were the toughest courses for them to pass? Which

03:05.170 --> 03:05.392
ones? Well, I imagine one of the first ones in those 
years was the very first one, the Industrial

03:10.230 --> 03:14.870
Stoichiometry course, and after that probably 
the Thermal course. And I've taught, I've taught

03:14.850 --> 03:20.650
every, see all the time I was department head, I 
taught one or two courses, and I've taught all the

03:20.630 --> 03:24.150
graduate courses over there, and I've taught all 
the undergraduate. I believe every last one of

03:25.923 --> 03:29.830
them, they've added one or two now that I haven't 
taught, but basically I had to teach a lot when we

03:29.810 --> 03:35.290
didn't, because we had, there were three of us 
there, Dr. Harris, Dr. Lindsay, and me, two full

03:35.270 --> 03:39.910
professors and assistants. Well, who had the 
heavy load? I was teaching about all, everything,

03:42.090 --> 03:46.670
but it didn't, it stood me in good stead later 
because I was, I had information and knowledge in

03:46.650 --> 03:54.260
all those fields when I'd go doing research. I 
could pull on thermometers. I could pull on a

03:55.220 --> 03:57.940
thermo or any of the others. You mentioned Smang as 
one of your key associates as a department head.

04:01.420 --> 04:02.801
Who were some of the others? Well, Al Cronk was one. 
Chris Browneman was first head of technology over

04:05.780 --> 04:12.620
there.

04:12.600 --> 04:19.120
Charlie Crawford, I think he was, he won the, he was 
head when I became head. Bob Whiting was head.

04:23.340 --> 04:25.560
And I believe Mr. Langford sat in. Yeah. He was on 
the, he may have still been head whenever I became

04:26.063 --> 04:33.260
head, but they had several after that.

04:36.997 --> 04:41.980
Let's see, then Jim Earl came along after Street. 
Those were the main ones, but I knew the department

04:41.960 --> 04:47.100
heads over in agriculture. Let me just tell you 
something. I'm not, I know you probably figure

04:48.080 --> 04:56.980
that the faculty senate is the way to do it, because 
a lot of them do. But I have, I think that the prime

04:57.960 --> 05:03.220
minister approach that we had back in those years 
is far superior. Because all the faculty senates

05:04.690 --> 05:09.400
turned out to be as an advisory council to the 
president. And what we had in those years was what

05:09.380 --> 05:14.360
was like the prime minister where the leader has to 
come in and face the music. And you've got all the

05:16.920 --> 05:19.920
people that have got authority there. And then if 
there's a question, the faculty is the one that

05:19.900 --> 05:23.740
ends up settling it. Because they'll appoint a 
committee. But it was a chance to see whether you

05:24.960 --> 05:26.980
got. Yeah. And Rudder withstood that. He handled 
that. What I've found doesn't work about a faculty

05:33.200 --> 05:39.540
senate is that they don't take responsibility for 
their recommendations. They don't. They

05:41.908 --> 05:45.220
recommend that somebody else do something and 
they walk away. I know it. And I've always wondered

05:46.200 --> 05:53.580
why couldn't we kind of combine the two where we 
would have an advisory group, that's, I mean a

05:53.560 --> 05:56.780
group that's appointed. Yeah. And a group that's 
elected and they have to work it out together.

06:01.960 --> 06:08.500
Well, I think having the department heads in there 
and the deans is really critical. Because these

06:08.480 --> 06:11.200
are the people that really have to make it all work. 
Those are the people that are really responsible

06:11.180 --> 06:14.460
for running the university. And anything you do, 
you need to get all their approvals. And the way it

06:18.660 --> 06:23.520
is, we don't have that joint meeting that they had 
then because we knew what they were doing over in

06:23.500 --> 06:26.680
agriculture, their feelings on anything. And I 
think that was a big mistake. When we went from, to

06:27.940 --> 06:34.560
being, and let me just say, while I'm saying about 
that, and the reason we went, I think, is because

06:34.540 --> 06:38.160
all the other universities are doing it. We need to 
be like everybody else. And that's what irritates

06:39.560 --> 06:44.280
me today, is to hear we want to be like so and so. We 
want to be like them. Well, you're never going to be

06:45.460 --> 06:47.640
number one. Being like somebody, the best you can 
ever be is number two. And what I believe is we are so

06:51.460 --> 06:57.380
unique and always have been that we ought to be 
ourselves. Yeah. And do the things that we think

06:58.307 --> 07:02.940
are best for us and our country, regardless of what 
these rankings turn out. Because those rankings

07:04.180 --> 07:07.420
they're turning out, you're beginning to see now, 
there's a lot of criticism of them in the journals.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.301
They don't mean much. But everybody just throws 
them at one another, and they're always talking

07:11.280 --> 07:15.200
about how good so and so is, how good so and so is. And 
instead of talking about it, they ought to be out

07:18.360 --> 07:22.740
doing something. All right. Back in the early 60s, 
you and I served together on that Century 6. Yeah.

07:27.424 --> 07:27.544
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I remember there was one 
study where we were to make recommendations as to

07:28.960 --> 07:32.600
what we thought A&M ought to aspire to be in 1976.

07:38.660 --> 07:45.120
Summarize, as you recall, what that group did and 
how it operated. Well, I think they had different

07:45.100 --> 07:50.620
task force that were making different studies. 
And I was one under Gus Watkins, who was then Dean of

07:50.600 --> 07:56.130
Agriculture. And I think Gus was the one thing I 
remember. remember, because that was the hottest

07:58.410 --> 08:04.090
topic there was in those years, was the Corps 
Cadets. And we thought the Corps was a good thing,

08:04.070 --> 08:10.230
but we didn't think it ought to be compulsory. And 
we made that recommendation, and I think old

08:10.210 --> 08:15.830
Watson hated to go up with it, but we did. And I don't 
know, that overshadows the other thing that we

08:16.515 --> 08:22.090
looked at, and I don't remember what all those were 
so much that, and I've forgotten, probably about

08:22.070 --> 08:30.270
that same time we're concerned about having women 
here, and of course that would have been another

08:35.270 --> 08:38.651
issue, and they would have been opening it up for 
women, too. And we felt like that for us to, if we did

08:41.650 --> 08:47.090
not do that, we were going to dwindle down to a 
little 2,000 student a year military college. Do

08:48.490 --> 08:52.070
you remember, in your working days, working 
group, task force, sometimes we called it a

08:52.070 --> 09:01.020
working party, do you remember anybody 
disagreeing with that recommendation? There

09:02.880 --> 09:05.000
wasn't anybody in our committee that did. I didn't 
remember either. But old Gus was a little bit

09:06.940 --> 09:15.340
wavery sometimes, and I think actually he may have 
got sent down on some of those South American trips

09:15.320 --> 09:18.960
because of him turning in what he turned in. I don't 
know. Do

09:19.940 --> 09:25.180
you remember what the argument was? What the 
arguments were, other than that it wouldn't be, we

09:25.160 --> 09:31.460
wouldn't grow in enrollment. You remember any 
other arguments? Well, it just wouldn't be a first

09:32.660 --> 09:35.026
class university. We'd just be a little military 
school and then be, that's what it would be noted

09:36.300 --> 09:43.600
for, that we just would not have the impact that we 
should have on the state of Texas if we got down to

09:43.580 --> 09:49.040
just simply a military school. In one of the early 
drafts that I wrote to summarize all of that, that

09:49.966 --> 09:55.020
it got to a point, uh-huh. That it got edited out, I 
think, I think I put in a phrase that we were afraid

09:55.443 --> 10:00.640
that if we don't make these changes, we may end up 
very much like VMI or the Citadel. Citadel, we had

10:06.420 --> 10:09.200
exactly the same thing. That, uh, would end up, uh, 
They didn't want to run them down, I guess. Do you

10:16.060 --> 10:23.040
remember, do you remember anybody being afraid to 
speak for that? There wasn't anybody in our

10:23.020 --> 10:25.040
committee. Well, see, it was up to Gus. Gus was the 
only one that might have had a problem. We were

10:29.420 --> 10:30.669
telling him what to say. And so, you can get a little 
bit of a stronger position about it if you don't

10:34.740 --> 10:37.794
have to make the statement yourself to them. But I 
think that group would have stood on what they

10:41.210 --> 10:43.001
felt. There just wasn't that, I mean, it was a 
pretty evident thing because you see, we had done

10:47.490 --> 10:51.545
everything Rutter had tried for, wanted us to do. 
We went over and canceled those corps, you know,

10:52.130 --> 10:54.910
to, you know, to, you know, to, you know, to, you 
know, to try to help them and do all that thing and

10:54.890 --> 10:58.420
still it didn't grow. It just went up very 
gradually and we just weren't making it. And so, we

11:02.894 --> 11:05.150
did everything that he could think of that, that, 
uh, to try to, try to make it go the way it was and it

11:05.130 --> 11:10.070
just wouldn't do it. As you recall, when the, uh, 
board, then it was called Board of Directors, now

11:11.055 --> 11:17.470
Board of Regents. When they approved the changes, 
do you remember how you and other faculty members

11:23.570 --> 11:24.024
reacted? What was your impression? No, I really 
don't. Uh, I, I guess I just felt like it was, it, it

11:27.060 --> 11:32.145
had to come. Uh, I guess the thing that really 
surprised me, well, it didn't surprise me at all,

11:33.170 --> 11:37.230
but my conclusion was it would take somebody like 
Rutter, who, uh, the former students could look at

11:43.690 --> 11:48.750
and say if, if that man, as strong as he was for the 
corps and all the things he did, if he thinks it

11:48.730 --> 11:53.910
ought to go that way, then we're going to have to go 
along with his decision, I think. I think that's

11:54.890 --> 12:02.028
what it took to get somebody with his credibility 
to do it. And I'll tell you, I've been over there two

12:02.390 --> 12:08.110
different summers, uh, where Pointe du Hoc and 
looked at, been in that, uh, in that dugout there

12:08.090 --> 12:14.890
and they've got inscribed and the, the guide the 
last time I was there, she had more to say. In fact,

12:17.050 --> 12:19.270
there's more said about him and all the guides and 
everything, anybody else. It's not Eisenhower

12:21.406 --> 12:23.038
and them, it's him. And they have a big discussion 
about him on all the tour guides going in there. Let

12:29.030 --> 12:36.720
me add, for the sake of this tape, when I first met 
General Omar Bradley, was, uh, at the Sun Bowl game

12:36.700 --> 12:43.681
about January 1, 1981 in El Paso. I had just gone out 
there. He was old physically, meaning he was in a

12:46.870 --> 12:52.610
wheelchair, couldn't walk, but his brain was 
still young. He looked up at me and said, you're

12:52.590 --> 12:54.186
from Texas A&M. Yes, sir. Uh-huh. Did you know Earl 
Rudder? Yes, sir. I worked with him. His voice

13:00.434 --> 13:01.960
broke a little and he said, in all of my 48 years of 
command responsibility, I never gave a tougher

13:01.940 --> 13:10.620
order to any officer than the one I gave to Earl in 
his outfit the night before D-Day because if they

13:10.600 --> 13:17.040
hadn't got, made it successfully up Pointe du Hoc 
and knocked out the German artillery, we would

13:23.440 --> 13:25.980
have had a massacre on both Omaha and Utah. Well, I 
didn't understand what he meant until I saw Pointe

13:25.960 --> 13:33.220
du Hoc two or three years later and realized, yes. 
Uh-huh. Well, you know that, uh, I've, I've heard

13:35.548 --> 13:40.700
that same thing from, uh, that he'd said it before. 
Uh, it's in some print or some, uh, news somewhere,

13:42.954 --> 13:47.140
uh, that this was the toughest assignment that 
anybody had during World War II. And, uh, so he was

13:51.381 --> 13:55.200
really revered over there. They left that thing 
just the way it was. How much did you and your

13:58.640 --> 14:03.160
colleagues in engineering, how often, how much 
did you all see of Mr. Rudder while he was

14:03.140 --> 14:04.481
president? I saw him a lot more. Not, he didn't run 
over there much. But, see, when people would give

14:09.400 --> 14:14.447
us money, uh, I would, uh, he would, we would always 
go to his office. And so he got to see everybody. And

14:18.755 --> 14:20.206
I got rel, well acquainted. We'd sit down and shoot 
the breeze a while and then we'd go eat lunch

14:21.920 --> 14:22.941
together. Uh-huh. In fact, I had lunch with him 
over there. I had lunch with him over in, uh, over in

14:24.920 --> 14:30.354
that, uh, Sabisa Hall, that dining room. Just a few 
days, he'd already had a stroke. And I could tell

14:33.617 --> 14:36.620
his lip was kind of, wasn't moving much. And I 
thought there was something wrong with him. But I

14:40.046 --> 14:41.940
got to know him real well. And, uh, old Fred said, 
told me one time, he says, you know, I had a hell of a

14:41.920 --> 14:47.440
job selling you to Rudder. But I was just talking to 
him the other day and he said, boy, he's sure high on

14:51.700 --> 14:52.721
you now. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha. Ha, ha. Ha, ha. But, uh, 
no, I got to know him real well and, uh, because we

14:56.545 --> 15:02.280
met so many different times. And he liked, he is 
different than some of the presidents. He wanted

15:05.392 --> 15:06.180
to know what was going on on the outside world. What 
the businesses people were doing, what they were

15:08.578 --> 15:11.440
thinking. That was one of the reasons he liked to 
eat with these, these people that were giving us

15:15.400 --> 15:15.943
money. He wanted to, to get their viewpoints on 
things. And I, I think that he was not true. I think

15:24.030 --> 15:25.411
he was a man of the house. But you were not turned on 
by eggheads. Oh, he wasn't. He wasn't. He told Fred

15:29.677 --> 15:32.570
one, and Fred told me this. It was, they were, I 
remember there at one time, I had a hard time there

15:32.550 --> 15:37.050
running that department. I had so much help from 
Charlie Squires and old Andy Sutton, all those

15:37.312 --> 15:42.530
guys knew so much more than anybody else. And, and 
old Squires knew so much about everything that he

15:44.450 --> 15:49.050
couldn't run physics but one year. Ha! But, 
anyway. Um, Fred told me this. No, he was in, he was

15:52.030 --> 15:53.720
in naphtha. told me this, that they ran out of a 
department head over there in physics. And Mr.

16:00.776 --> 16:01.540
Rutter, you know what his background was. He had 
all these people over there who were big theorists

16:07.350 --> 16:11.370
and so forth, and he called them in there in his 
office over in that old administration building,

16:11.350 --> 16:16.668
and he said, we need to pick up a department head 
from among you people.

16:19.538 --> 16:20.260
Which one of you would make a good department head? 
And he said, I've never heard people run one

16:26.400 --> 16:33.772
another down so much in all my life. And he said, 
they concluded there wasn't any of them fit to be

16:35.660 --> 16:38.191
department heads. But here he was. He 
outmaneuvered that bunch of so-called eggheads

16:44.480 --> 16:48.261
just so far ahead of them in his way. That's the way 
it ended up. But they, they couldn't, they

16:51.640 --> 16:54.913
couldn't handle the situation. He handled it. All 
right, you mentioned two men, Squire and Suttle.

17:02.321 --> 17:05.210
Go back and describe for this recording Dr. 
Suttle. Who was he and what was his task? Well, he

17:10.150 --> 17:19.561
came from Mississippi, and he worked under Liddy 
for his PhD. And he also worked down at Exxon. At

17:23.277 --> 17:25.995
their research lab. And I was talking with some of 
the Exxon people in research, and they said he was

17:28.170 --> 17:32.810
the only guy down there never written a report all 
the time he was there. And then I had one year, to

17:32.790 --> 17:39.090
give you a really feel about it, I had Jim Galloway, 
who's one of our former students, about the class

17:39.070 --> 17:46.130
of 20-something, and he was head of all production 
for Humboldt Oil and Refining Company. And

17:48.389 --> 17:50.930
Charlie Jones, whom I'd met the summer I worked 
down there and got acquainted with. I had him come

17:53.470 --> 17:56.007
up and speak to the engineering faculty. And so as 
we were going from the airport over to the, I was

18:00.380 --> 18:03.544
going to take him over and let him visit Rutter. And 
as we were going from the airport,

18:05.560 --> 18:13.420
they said, well, we'll run by and see Andy just run 
through his office. They said, by the way, what do

18:13.820 --> 18:16.809
you think of him? I said, well, you know, he's 
probably done some good and some bad. I hear he came

18:24.960 --> 18:29.220
to us highly recommended from Exxon. See, they 
want to get rid of you. Old Charlie said, well, he is

18:32.760 --> 18:36.080
a great scientist. And then old Jim Galloway said, 
yeah, he's a great scientist. And so he said, well,

18:42.780 --> 18:48.380
we'll just, he said, Charlie says, you know, he is 
an odd duck, isn't he? So they said, well, we'll

18:49.260 --> 18:53.520
just kind of run through his office and then go on in 
and talk to Rudder. Now, his task was, he was vice

18:53.500 --> 18:58.860
president for research. I really don't know what 
his job was. He had an office over there, kind of an

19:01.900 --> 19:04.780
advisor. And Fred Smith told me another funny one 
on him. You knew Fred Smith that taught geology?

19:15.040 --> 19:17.640
Well, he had advised students every once in a 
while. And according to Fred, they had some of

19:19.280 --> 19:25.870
these science students up here. And one of them 
wanted to talk to a real authority about nuclear

19:26.920 --> 19:30.520
energy. And so who else would be better than 
somebody that worked under Liddy? So they lined

19:36.120 --> 19:38.520
him up over there. But when she called him up, the 
girl did, he made an appointment at night over in

19:38.620 --> 19:43.800
his office. And it just had this lady running the 
dorms just all upset about it. And when she went to

19:49.330 --> 19:53.390
Rudder with it, that he'd had that girl over there 
at night. And Rudder went, they said, went

19:53.930 --> 19:56.510
storming down the hall. That's the second damn 
mistake he's made this week.

20:06.720 --> 20:10.840
But I always had a lot of help with how I ought to be 
running the department from both Squires and Andy

20:10.820 --> 20:14.740
Suttle. Right now, did Squires succeed Andy as 
vice president? No, actually they were both here

20:20.020 --> 20:25.960
at the same time, and Squires was kind of working 
over in the science and Andy was kind of over in the

20:25.940 --> 20:37.060
system.

20:37.040 --> 20:44.890
They got along very well together, but they were 
always telling everybody else how to run their

20:44.870 --> 20:45.891
business. They were going to help Rutter improve 
A&M College, Texas A&M University. All right,

20:49.750 --> 20:55.990
let's see, let's go back to Wayne Hull as vice 
president for research. I guess when you became, I

20:56.770 --> 21:02.030
mean vice president for academic affairs, when 
you became a department head. Well he had it. He had

21:03.530 --> 21:10.350
been a department head in science, I mean in plant 
science, and then he moved up to become, and he held

21:10.330 --> 21:15.510
that for a long time. And then he succeeded by 
Coonsey. No, yeah, Coonsey was a graduate dean. A

21:21.010 --> 21:24.730
graduate dean, well that's what Hull was for a long 
time. Hull was a graduate dean. He was both. He was

21:26.710 --> 21:27.731
both. He was both. Vice president for academic and 
graduate dean. Oh, okay. Well I used to meet with

21:29.975 --> 21:31.730
him. I used to serve on those committees. In fact, 
one of the first committees I served on was with, I

21:32.710 --> 21:39.230
used to serve on the curriculum committee when I 
served with Heaton, Al Chalk, and Mr. Godby, if you

21:39.210 --> 21:48.570
remember back that far. We were on, and old Ty Timm 
was turning courses into us every time you flipped

21:48.550 --> 21:54.770
a switch, he had a course in. Ty Timm. Ty Timm did. 
Yeah. Who did, in those days, campus wide, who do

21:58.612 --> 22:08.180
you think were the most influential people other 
than, than Mr. Rudder? Whose opinion did Mr.

22:13.367 --> 22:13.921
Rudder listen to? Oh, I think he took, I think he 
took Benson's opinion over most all the others.

22:18.900 --> 22:19.362
Okay. And I don't know he asked it, I don't know 
whether he took it, because Benson told me that if

22:25.130 --> 22:28.010
somebody from outside criticized me, jump, jump, 
jump. Jump through his asshole. We better take

22:28.990 --> 22:30.011
that off. But he said that, you know, if they said 
anything, he didn't, he didn't always accept it,

22:29.990 --> 22:39.270
but he accepted stuff on the outside more. But I 
think he was, I think Benson was the one he always

22:41.090 --> 22:50.160
turned to on about all the problems. Now, those, I 
as a junior faculty member in history, I and my

22:50.140 --> 22:57.160
buddies heard that of the four deans, the only two 
that really had a vote that mattered was the Dean of

22:57.140 --> 23:02.760
Engineering and the Dean of Agriculture. Uh-huh. 
I imagine that. That Arts and Sciences didn't

23:05.740 --> 23:09.160
matter much and Vet Medicine was so small. Yeah. 
And that Benson, serving through a long time as

23:10.407 --> 23:16.600
Dean of Engineering, that he mattered most. 
Uh-huh. Now, you served as department head for how

23:19.660 --> 23:22.240
long? Twenty-three years, from 64 to 87. Wouldn't 
you be, wouldn't, you were the senior department

23:25.220 --> 23:28.240
head? Yeah. By far, weren't you? Yeah. Um. 
Actually, the only, the biggest reason they

23:32.220 --> 23:34.960
wanted to get rid of him is because he had served 23 
years. And I mean, they were really on me to, uh, you

23:37.460 --> 23:44.620
get to a point where regardless of what you did, 
they're still going to be after you. And I had told

23:47.140 --> 23:53.530
them I was going to retire in August of 87. And they 
were having some awards meeting up there. And I

23:56.030 --> 24:13.250
said,

23:56.030 --> 24:13.250
well, Charlie,

23:56.030 --> 24:13.250
why don't you just step down right now and we can 
start hunting. I mean, not right now, but step down

24:13.916 --> 24:18.130
here in a month or two and then we can start looking 
for a new department head. I said, well, I told you I

24:19.110 --> 24:21.490
was going to step down in August. What's wrong with 
that? Well, we could just do so much better if you'd

24:22.470 --> 24:25.490
just step down. And I said, well, I did. And I said, 
well, I don't care to until the time allocated. And

24:32.520 --> 24:37.130
so they got Richardson in there and they went at it 
again. I said, when Richard's, I said, if you want

24:37.110 --> 24:42.570
me to step down so damn bad, I'll quit this minute. 
Do you want it? And that was the end of it. He didn't

24:46.570 --> 24:49.830
want it that fast. And so I had, uh, I served on until 
exactly when I told them I was ready to step down.

24:55.570 --> 24:56.162
All right. Let's, let's go back. Mr. Rudder. Mr. 
Rudder dies in early 1970 arranged for him to give a

24:59.257 --> 25:07.590
paper over in, uh, uh, I believe it was Atlanta and 
I'd written it on continuing education. And I went

25:12.600 --> 25:16.620
in to see him and he, he, I believe it was really 
dragging on him. Cause he said, Charlie, I just

25:16.600 --> 25:19.620
don't see how I can do this. I said, sure. You can do 
it. All you gotta do is read it. I'll write the dang

25:22.600 --> 25:23.621
thing. All you got to do it. Read it. And Morgan was, 
used to be here as president was the one that was,

25:25.144 --> 25:30.260
had asked me to give him, uh, get some, get him to 
give a paper. And, uh, so it turned out that Fred

25:33.600 --> 25:37.760
Benson had to read it. He had the stroke before that 
occurred. So I'd just been over his office a little

25:41.540 --> 25:44.120
before that. All right. Then we briefly had Clyde 
Freeman, I believe it is, as the interim and then

25:44.845 --> 25:50.620
Jack Williams. Let's see. No, uh, we had, uh, 
Ludeke. Oh, I'm sorry. General. General Ludeke.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.661
General Ludeke. General Ludeke. Yes. Uh huh. Yes. 
Um, did Ludeke have any, did you have any

26:00.865 --> 26:02.620
interaction with him? Oh yeah. He asked me to look 
into this faculty club and I looked all over the

26:02.842 --> 26:06.520
place and found out that unless you had drinks, if 
you wanted one to make profit, you're going to have

26:06.500 --> 26:10.920
to have something like that. And another thing 
that I asked him to do, and it was already too late. I

26:16.200 --> 26:18.620
said that way, that thing is designed over there. 
You can't have a meeting in it and it needs to be to

26:18.600 --> 26:23.540
where you can have all the people in there. So, uh, 
something in the faculty club that's a dinner of

26:24.103 --> 26:30.720
some sort where you have a speaker and that way you 
can, it can make money that way. And he said, well,

26:34.380 --> 26:37.120
it's too late to change it. And he wanted me to, uh, 
and I did and I finally just reported to him that,

26:37.100 --> 26:42.340
that, uh, I didn't think that they could not make a 
go of it, uh, unless they had some, and they, it's,

26:48.240 --> 26:51.380
I've been proven correct. I was, I was a junior 
member of that committee. Uh-huh. For that, all of

26:55.286 --> 27:00.000
that expansion of the MSC and the Rudder Tower. And 
I was arguing the same thing as you because the

26:59.980 --> 27:09.100
faculty club on the 11th and 12th floors, each of 
those little dining areas is so small that you

27:09.080 --> 27:15.300
can't get enough people in one place. Uh-huh. And 
so I told them that and it wasn't. But the

27:18.280 --> 27:20.300
architect, uh, his. They, somebody saw it, one in 
Dallas like that. And I think I've eaten in that one

27:22.520 --> 27:24.420
in Dallas. Uh-huh. And that's the way they wanted 
it designed. That's the reason it got designed

27:26.520 --> 27:28.540
that way. Yeah. And Rudder, and, uh, Ludeke said, 
well, it's just too late, you know, to change it.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.321
And he accepted it. He just didn't like it much, but 
he, I just told him, you know, we just can't, uh,

27:34.300 --> 27:39.780
it's hard enough to get people to go out at night and 
eat anyway. What would you, what, uh, description

27:44.040 --> 27:49.640
would you give of the manner in which he filled in as 
the interim president? Oh, I think he's, I think he

27:50.620 --> 27:53.440
was an excellent individual. I think General 
Ludeke is one of the top. One of the top people that,

27:54.740 --> 28:01.440
uh, and actually Fred told me that General Rudder 
got him, uh, just hired him. And Fred said, I tried

28:02.420 --> 28:08.120
to get him to take Ludeke and let him help him 
administer, and he wouldn't do it. He wanted to do

28:09.100 --> 28:10.121
it all himself. And so he gave him to me, but, uh, he 
ran the station. I worked for him some under there,

28:14.210 --> 28:21.940
but he was really, uh, uh, a nice individual. 
Describe his, uh. Very. Low key, but very

28:24.687 --> 28:28.360
definite. I sat with him on committee meetings and 
he didn't, uh, throw his former rank or anything

28:33.500 --> 28:33.943
around. And, uh, in fact, I was just over 
interviewing the, uh, transportation

28:35.110 --> 28:40.040
department. His son is named Al Ludeke and he's a 
head of all planning over there. And I didn't know

28:44.120 --> 28:46.720
about it until I called over there. The same Al 
Ludeke. Here? He went to A&M, but his son, Al

28:48.444 --> 28:54.520
Ludeke's son is also named Al Ludeke and he's 
running the planning division of the Texas, uh,

28:54.500 --> 29:02.570
Transportation Department, TxDOT. And I went 
over and we had an interview with him and, uh, and,

29:02.550 --> 29:06.290
uh. The few times I was in his office, I never saw a 
more orderly, cleaner desk. Everything seemed to

29:13.630 --> 29:23.860
be in order, uh, and, uh, with me, he asked very few 
questions, but they were always very specific. He

29:25.080 --> 29:30.100
was very skillfully planned and he seemed to be an 
extremely good listener. Mm-hmm. Well, you see,

29:30.763 --> 29:38.220
what happened was that after the war, the, uh, 
Atomic Energy Commission, they put him in, he was

29:38.200 --> 29:40.560
running that, but you never heard of him. He 
doesn't, he wasn't out there making a lot of

29:40.540 --> 29:43.540
racket. Mm-hmm. Then they had trouble with that, 
uh, lab, that space laboratory out in, uh,

29:44.244 --> 29:51.100
Stanford. And so they sent him out there and they, 
they'd been screwing up when he got out there. It

29:55.040 --> 29:56.081
started to work. Yeah. And so everywhere he went, 
he was able to solve the problems and he didn't make

29:56.605 --> 30:00.300
a big stir about it. So I, I like. He was a Chemical 
Engineering graduate, class of 1932. Now, he came

30:05.440 --> 30:09.360
back after serving as Interim President. He came 
back to Engineering. Is that right? Yeah, no, he

30:12.660 --> 30:15.900
was serving in Engineering before he ever became, 
But, I mean, he went over to the President then?

30:18.860 --> 30:21.900
Well, I'm not really sure he ever really served any 
over there. I think that was just a discussion

30:21.880 --> 30:24.060
before. And then whenever, when Rutter died, they 
took him out of engineering and made him acting

30:24.040 --> 30:31.840
president. All right, but then after Williams 
came, he came back over to... He may have, I don't

30:36.440 --> 30:37.941
really remember. Jack Williams came. Describe 
your impressions of Jack Williams as president.

30:45.080 --> 30:48.200
Well, I think he was the man for that time. I'm

30:48.180 --> 30:58.810
not really sure that I'd, I don't know that I'd rank 
him anywhere near Rutter. I think Rutter's one of

30:59.530 --> 31:02.250
the best ones in here, that's ever been here, but 
yet I would have given him the poorest chances when

31:02.330 --> 31:06.590
he came of anybody we've ever had.

31:09.490 --> 31:13.050
But I think Jack did a good job as president, and 
because of his academic background, he could see

31:13.350 --> 31:17.330
what was needed. I think anything that he did...
