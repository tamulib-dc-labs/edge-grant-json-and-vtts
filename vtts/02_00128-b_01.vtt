00:03.372 --> 00:07.057
Let's see.

00:07.998 --> 00:10.842
When did you hear that Jack Williams was the new 
president? How did you hear? I heard in 1971.

00:18.992 --> 00:21.335
Do you remember a moment or a conversation? Mr. 
Heaton told me. I think that at that time they had

00:23.618 --> 00:29.245
the...

00:32.245 --> 00:37.933
The executive committee preceded the APC. The 
executive committee at that time was made up of the

00:37.973 --> 00:47.606
president of the university and all the deans and 
the vice presidents. Although Mr. Heaton was not

00:47.747 --> 00:52.854
a, well he would have been a dean at that time. Mr. 
Heaton was always on all of the major committees at

00:54.416 --> 01:01.746
the university, even when he was a director. And I 
believe that he had, there had been a, there had

01:01.844 --> 01:13.703
been a call meeting, was, General Ludeke was 
acting president, if I'm not mistaken, at that

01:01.844 --> 01:13.703
time. And I believe there had been a call meeting, 
and I assume that he got his information from the

01:14.824 --> 01:29.187
executive committee and told us that Dr. Williams 
would be named president of the university. Do you

01:29.207 --> 01:30.028
remember your first encounter or first meeting? 
Well, I knew who Dr. Williams was because of his

01:33.006 --> 01:39.673
assignment at the Coordinating Board. I believe 
he was the first commissioner of the Coordinating

01:40.635 --> 01:44.980
Board. See, I did a lot of work with the 
Coordinating Board in doing all the reports for

01:45.000 --> 01:57.614
the university, the student academic reports and 
things like that, although I didn't work with Dr.

01:45.000 --> 01:57.614
Williams, but I knew a lot of the staff over there 
and I knew who he was. And so I was... So I was

02:00.063 --> 02:04.768
acquainted with him. I didn't know anything about 
his style or anything like that at all. As you

02:12.137 --> 02:19.605
arrived, as he arrived I mean, do you remember any 
major changes or anything? How did he enter A&M?

02:24.171 --> 02:28.095
What was his style?

02:30.910 --> 02:47.214
It seems to me that there were a lot of changes made 
in the committee structures that I recall that

02:30.910 --> 02:47.214
took place fairly quickly after he came in and out. 
Certainly he had his blessings. I don't know if he

02:49.678 --> 02:55.787
was the architect, so to speak, of it, but that was 
the time that the ABC came into being, I believe. Is

02:56.375 --> 02:58.378
that correct? Yeah, I think so. I think that's 
when, and I know Dr. Calhoun and Dr. Minerty had a

02:59.680 --> 03:07.511
lot of input on that.

03:09.153 --> 03:22.171
Dr. Williams,

03:09.153 --> 03:22.171
I felt, didn't, it didn't seem to me, it maybe was 
because of the relationship that Mr. Rudder had

03:22.211 --> 03:24.795
with a lot of us who'd been here a long time, It 
seemed to me that it took us a while to get to know Dr.

03:25.180 --> 03:33.790
Williams. After we got to know him, we felt more 
comfortable. And it may have been because of the

03:37.494 --> 03:41.759
assignment that he had and what he was trying to do. 
The university, Dr. General Ludeke, of course,

03:42.499 --> 03:50.108
was acting president at that time, but it could be 
that A lot of things were being helped on the

03:50.476 --> 03:56.862
burner, so to speak, until they got in a full-time 
president. And when he got here, he might have had

03:56.902 --> 04:06.912
his plates loaded, and he was not as accessible as 
maybe we thought he should be. But that later

04:06.993 --> 04:08.374
changed. And then I got to know him fairly well 
because of our graduation ceremonies and being on

04:08.394 --> 04:17.023
the stage with him and that sort of thing. Describe 
his manner at graduation. Oh, very elated with the

04:21.104 --> 04:25.110
function. He loved it. He was very cordial to the 
students. You could tell that he felt it was a

04:31.459 --> 04:35.706
wonderful ceremony. And I think, of course, 
anybody that comes to A&M Commencement, most

04:35.826 --> 04:45.340
schools that they've been to, don't have what this 
institution offers here. And most presidents or

04:45.742 --> 04:55.353
deans that are at other schools and come down here 
and see what we do are extremely impressed with it.

04:55.373 --> 04:59.157
And I think he loved every moment of it. I never 
heard him say that he disliked any aspect of it.

05:03.402 --> 05:08.948
There were certain things that he would have done 
his particular way and that sort of thing. And

05:08.969 --> 05:10.570
that's understandable. And we did it. As I said 
earlier, I think we're where we are today

05:13.720 --> 05:25.190
because of his administration. Now, he selects 
Calhoun as his chief academic officer not long

05:25.210 --> 05:30.936
after he got here. Describe Calhoun, the 
administrator, from your point of view as the

05:32.037 --> 05:39.944
registrar.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.145
Well, I thought at first, that Dr. Calhoun might

05:41.564 --> 05:53.922
look on us as a necessary evil kind, so to speak. And 
that probably had a lot to do with all the programs

05:53.942 --> 06:01.774
that he had interest in and that sort of thing.

06:04.157 --> 06:10.727
Gee, I always thought our salvation in that 
operation down there was Haskell and Rowe.

06:10.927 --> 06:26.628
Because, as you know, we became more or less 
responsible, directly responsible for you, and I

06:10.927 --> 06:26.628
think you always understood our... You have to 
understand when you ask a question like that, I

06:10.927 --> 06:26.628
have to look and see what kind of attention were we 
getting. Dr. Calhoun, as I say, he... And I

06:28.651 --> 06:35.460
understand that from his background, from his 
education. I mean, you know, research,

06:35.540 --> 06:40.326
teaching...

06:41.133 --> 07:05.318
all the the curriculum the academic programs and 
things like that was certainly most important to

06:41.133 --> 07:05.318
him he knew that we had to have the function of what 
we did over there so it was wise on his part i think to

06:41.133 --> 07:05.318
have someone like you that understood what what we 
were all about and gave us the support so but Dr.

07:06.395 --> 07:08.418
Calhoun did a wonderful job. I mean, he did a 
superior job in leading the school and that sort of

07:08.598 --> 07:15.748
thing. You know, when you get close to 
administrators and whatnot, you can't help but

07:16.950 --> 07:24.420
compare. And so that's, you know, I'm not trying to 
say anything negative about him because he and I

07:24.440 --> 07:33.212
got along.

07:34.357 --> 07:37.661
And Dr. Rinerdi and I got along. But it just, you 
feel like when someone is aware and is tuned in to

07:37.821 --> 07:51.016
what you're doing, then you have to make a 
comparison between former administrators. And

07:51.536 --> 07:54.620
not that it's negative, it wasn't negative for any 
of them. I think John did a good job. One of the

07:57.963 --> 08:02.288
practices I think I remember throughout all these 
years was a, session between every graduating

08:02.740 --> 08:16.657
senior in the last semester and a representative 
of the registrar looking at their transcript to be

08:02.740 --> 08:16.657
sure that, where did that begin? Do you know?

08:21.002 --> 08:24.005
Before I answer that, let me say one thing about 
John Calhoun. Oh, okay. Please do. John Calhoun

08:25.507 --> 08:31.414
implemented the Texas A&M that was the finest, 
greatest, working committee that that campus had

08:32.221 --> 08:39.271
ever seen, and that was called the Academic 
Operations Committee. He put that in. The

08:40.032 --> 08:50.907
Academic Operations Committee, if you remember, 
was made up of all of the assistant or associate

08:40.032 --> 08:50.907
deans and the registrar or admissions people. And 
it brought us together like nothing before had

08:50.927 --> 08:55.393
ever done. And we could sit there and talk about our 
problems and our plans And it just made our work,

09:00.419 --> 09:12.471
everybody knew what the other person was doing, 
what to expect, what we were going to do, and that

09:00.419 --> 09:12.471
sort of thing. I always felt that that was just a 
tremendous decision. I don't know if he was under

09:19.478 --> 09:22.301
his administration. I don't know if it was his idea 
or whose idea it was that he got done. It's still

09:26.005 --> 09:26.665
there. It's still working. And people today tell 
me that it's still one of the best committees out

09:29.512 --> 09:31.314
there. I always thought it was the people at the 
real working level where you could throw theory

09:31.334 --> 09:37.662
out the door. Here it was down at the grassroots. 
And they worked with students, and that's what

09:42.088 --> 09:45.252
this was all about. Every one of them had students. 
We had the students to deal with and their records.

09:50.759 --> 09:57.848
And a prime example of that was when we then took a 
large number of those people that were on that

09:57.997 --> 10:08.349
committee when I implemented this touchstone 
registration system and this total automated

09:57.997 --> 10:08.349
record system that we finally got in. I had those 
people on my committee. It's a working committee.

10:16.519 --> 10:21.244
John Calhoun, I give him credit for that. I'm 
sorry. I was going to digress a second. The

10:26.110 --> 10:27.852
conference that You're absolutely

10:28.777 --> 10:37.867
correct.

10:40.470 --> 10:54.766
Every student

10:40.470 --> 10:54.766
that was a candidate for a degree, you came in and 
you filed for a degree, you filed a degree

10:40.470 --> 10:54.766
application form in your last semester to 
graduate. And a record was checked. and uh if you

10:58.426 --> 11:28.281
had and then each student was sent a letter and in 
that letter it said you're clear or you have

10:58.426 --> 11:28.281
problems so if you had problems you had to excuse me 
uh in the earlier days uh whether you had problems

10:58.426 --> 11:28.281
didn't have problems you had to go in and have that 
conference you had to go in and sit down and talk to

10:58.426 --> 11:28.281
an assistant registrar that was in charge of 
graduation and it was just a counseling session

10:58.426 --> 11:28.281
where the office went over your your record and you 
were clear that was it you were out if you had

11:28.615 --> 11:51.349
difficulties such as substitutions and all that 
kind of stuff then you were directed to go over to

11:28.615 --> 11:51.349
the dean's office and get these substitutions 
approved and that sort of thing short on grade

11:28.615 --> 11:51.349
points it was a final check the problem i always had 
with that it was a little bit late you know why

11:52.477 --> 12:21.623
should a student be given a paper or a letter uh two 
months before he was graduating and if he couldn't

11:52.477 --> 12:21.623
go register for a course which he couldn't that 
late then what does he do he's here for another

11:52.477 --> 12:21.623
semester so that was another thing that we worked 
on to try to get that out early in the student's

11:52.477 --> 12:21.623
career and with these academic advisors i talked 
to you about a while ago and after we got all this

11:52.477 --> 12:21.623
automation see every semester when those grades 
are applied By terminal now, that academic

12:22.379 --> 12:34.532
faculty or that faculty member can sit there, call 
up John Doe's record, see right where it is, tell

12:22.379 --> 12:34.532
him what the deficiencies are, what his extra 
hours are, whatever. So changes can be made way

12:35.473 --> 12:39.978
prior to the last semester. And surely there must 
be some good anecdotes from those conversations

12:39.998 --> 12:48.927
with those students who thought they were going to 
graduate.

12:49.463 --> 13:05.198
Well, not having done any of that myself, that was 
one thing that I never did do up there, although we

12:49.463 --> 13:05.198
had people doing it.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.340
I'm kind of lost at that, Haskell. All right, was it 
your direct responsibility then to see to it that

13:16.430 --> 13:21.276
All the correct diplomas were here for the people. 
That's correct. As you know, for many, many, many,

13:23.579 --> 13:31.549
many years, up until, well, they were doing it in 
1998. When I did my last commencement, they were

13:32.410 --> 13:35.715
doing it in May of 88. It's not done today. Oh, 
really?

13:40.260 --> 13:40.501
Uh-huh. The diplomas are up there. Uh-huh. But 
there are students that are walking across the

13:42.805 --> 13:47.810
stage who may or may not have fallen by for 
graduation. Prior to 1988, nobody crossed that

13:48.110 --> 14:03.224
stage unless they were certified and all the hot 
wax or whatever were put on their diploma and got

13:48.110 --> 14:03.224
the real diploma. Describe the routine you all 
went through to get all those diplomas in the right

14:03.944 --> 14:10.230
order So they could be handed out. Okay. Well, 
again, the student applied for a degree in the

14:14.971 --> 14:20.317
semester in which they were to finish. And so we had 
a list going. And this was done by colleges and done

14:22.879 --> 14:27.564
by, broken down by department and by degree. And 
the diplomas were ordered. You also had to file,

14:30.667 --> 14:36.893
pay a diploma fee and order your diploma. All the 
diplomas were ordered. There was a cutoff date.

14:40.621 --> 14:45.667
For example, in the fall semester, the cutoff date 
would be around the 15th of October. You had from

14:45.687 --> 14:55.498
September the 1st or now August the 30th or 
whatever up to September, October the 15th to

14:45.687 --> 14:55.498
order your diploma. Everybody's diplomas were 
ordered who applied for them. And the diploma

14:59.643 --> 15:02.066
company would print them and get them into us. So we 
had them all there prior to, you know, a month or so

15:02.086 --> 15:07.032
before graduation. And we'd go ahead, and at the 
same time, we were building a program, a

15:07.889 --> 15:16.742
commencement program. And there would always be a 
lot of students that knew they weren't going to

15:17.944 --> 15:25.274
graduate, so they'd come in and tell you, hey, I'm 
not going to make it. Their name would be taken off

15:25.294 --> 15:27.217
the list. So we had a program built as early as 
November the 1st. And we just kept that as our

15:35.294 --> 15:38.378
master list. And then on that magic cutoff day, 
which was Thursday at 5 o'clock prior to the

15:39.259 --> 15:55.841
ceremony on Friday,

15:39.259 --> 15:55.841
well, that would be it. And we posted a master list 
in the office, and all the people who were still

15:56.442 --> 16:04.272
candidates, come in and they blew. They had a red 
dot by their name. They were clear. If it didn't

16:10.246 --> 16:13.750
have a red dot by their name, then they had a 
problem. And they had to file a clock on Thursday

16:13.770 --> 16:17.355
and cleared it up. And after that, then, we went 
down to the A&M Printing Center that night, and by

16:17.375 --> 16:26.587
about midnight, we had our commencement program 
finished. While we were down there having the

16:27.268 --> 16:34.377
programs completed, Don Carter and his group 
would be over in the office with a duplicate list of

16:34.677 --> 16:45.429
the commencement program, stacking the diplomas 
in the order in which they would be given out. And

16:45.449 --> 16:50.134
they were going to put on those large racks that 
you've seen there on the stage. And on the outside

16:50.154 --> 16:55.020
of each tube was a name. That's right. And as you 
know, we have a caller. And of course, those

16:58.454 --> 17:05.583
diplomas are stacked in reverse order, such that 
you come out at the top and you're correct. And

17:05.603 --> 17:11.851
since we graduate by colleges, then they all have 
to be done, then they're alphabetical within

17:05.603 --> 17:11.851
degree. All the bachelor of science degrees will 
be, I mean all the master of science degrees will be

17:12.432 --> 17:27.972
here, but if you're getting a bachelor of science 
in economics, then they're alphabetical within

17:12.432 --> 17:27.972
economics, and then following that might be 
physics, and then they're alphabetical within

17:12.432 --> 17:27.972
that. The key to the man standing at the diploma 
rack is the collar. He's got to be sure that when he

17:34.494 --> 17:37.957
calls that name, the diploma there matches. It's 
quite an ordeal to get that done properly. Did any

17:41.781 --> 17:44.343
of them ever get spilled on stage? No, I don't think 
we ever had an accident like that. We have had a time

17:48.387 --> 17:53.592
or two where there would not be a diploma for a 
person. And we kept a box down by the side of the rack

17:57.466 --> 17:59.428
It had nothing but the empty white tube. And, of 
course, we'd just pick it up, hand it to the

18:00.089 --> 18:04.895
president, and the audience never knew what 
happened. Now, the recipient knew what happened,

18:04.915 --> 18:11.544
and they were kind of hot when they got out in the 
audience and opened up and found that they had

18:04.915 --> 18:11.544
nothing inside. I mean, they usually were back up 
at the stage asking questions after the ceremony.

18:19.214 --> 18:26.663
More often than not, what was the situation for 
those that got a blank?

18:27.554 --> 18:31.761
Oh, well, it could be two or three things. One, it 
could be that the student didn't qualify. He or

18:35.787 --> 18:45.764
she, we look on the master list, and they didn't 
have a red dot, and they were short grade points, or

18:35.787 --> 18:45.764
they hadn't completed this particular course or 
whatever. It could be that we might have made a

18:45.884 --> 18:49.610
mistake. As much as you check those things and 
check those things, sometimes they'll get by. And

18:54.571 --> 18:58.077
for whatever those reasons were, there just 
wasn't one there.

19:01.363 --> 19:03.767
I think those were the two categories. Do you 
remember any situations where the wrong tube went

19:03.787 --> 19:10.799
to the wrong person? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes, I can 
recall doing that. And that simply came because

19:15.387 --> 19:20.055
you might make a mistake yourself. You'd look 
down, and you'd hear a name, and you might just pick

19:20.305 --> 19:24.069
the wrong tube. You want to pick the one next to it 
up. And in my case, the years that I did that, as soon

19:26.251 --> 19:31.616
as I handed it to the president, I knew it was wrong. 
But instead of taking it back from him, the next guy

19:31.636 --> 19:38.543
would get a blank tube, and we'd be back on track 
then after that. Now, normally you and Don Carter,

19:39.103 --> 19:46.670
in the years that I was familiar, you all worked 
that. He pulled it out and handed it to you? That's

19:49.033 --> 19:49.333
correct. That's correct. And then I did that until 
I became executive director. And then after that,

19:57.784 --> 20:04.413
Don did it all with the business. Yes, I did that 
from Mr. Perriman was doing it for a while. And then

20:12.544 --> 20:15.207
I guess I started doing that in 1969. And I did it 
until 86. When you graduated, was it? Did you get

20:19.385 --> 20:20.887
your diploma in a tube? Exactly the same, sir. The 
president was there, handed the diploma to me, and

20:23.431 --> 20:29.281
it was a real joy. As far as I know, we've done that. I 
don't know when, which would be an interesting

20:30.723 --> 20:41.620
question to find an answer to. How long have they 
been doing that? Or did they do that? Because I

20:46.182 --> 20:54.952
agree with you, there are not many institutions 
today that still truly hand out diplomas. There

20:54.972 --> 21:00.238
are not many institutions where almost every 
student attends. We have a high percentage of

21:00.258 --> 21:03.702
attendance. And therefore, there is given to that 
student and his or her family a very warm feeling

21:03.722 --> 21:14.535
about the last event. Do you remember any 
last-minute crises relating to commencements?

21:22.251 --> 21:24.414
Well, we'd have the usual one. You can imagine the 
disappointment.

21:28.661 --> 21:43.864
I don't think I'm talking to you, maybe not 
answering your question, but the big

21:28.661 --> 21:43.864
disappointment would be because

21:28.661 --> 21:43.864
former students of Texas A&M University don't 
think that the university ever makes mistakes or

21:28.661 --> 21:43.864
that they should make mistakes. I mean, I've had 
them call me on the phone and say, you guys don't

21:44.131 --> 21:48.196
make mistakes. We don't make, Aggies don't make 
mistakes. Of course, it would be a great letdown

21:50.298 --> 22:00.330
when a kid, we wouldn't have a diploma for him or 
he'd open his empty tooth. And you'd have families

22:00.350 --> 22:07.418
that would come up, but they would always be, after 
they understood what the situation was, hey,

22:00.350 --> 22:07.418
we're going to take care of you. Many times on 
Saturday morning, we'd take them back over to the

22:07.478 --> 22:13.885
office and we found what the problem was and 
everything was solved at that time. But you never

22:14.270 --> 22:20.359
had a crisis where the diplomas didn't get here on 
time, where the program didn't get printed? The

22:21.801 --> 22:26.228
crisis I remember, no, to answer your question, 
no, about the diplomas. I don't recall that in my

22:26.308 --> 22:28.952
area at all. The big crisis that we were up against 
at one time had to do with the printing of the

22:29.012 --> 22:33.599
program. We had been down there all night, as I told 
you. Well, actually, we finished it at about

22:38.766 --> 22:42.572
midnight. We got back to the office, and one of the 
people that was helping just happened to be

22:44.088 --> 22:59.522
thumbing through the program, and we were 
awarding a posthumous degree that year. And as you

23:01.163 --> 23:10.591
recall, we always had an asterisk by the name, and 
then the footnote, posthumous, posthumously

23:01.163 --> 23:10.591
awarded, posthumously, I think is what it said. 
The word posthumously was misspelled. We have

23:13.298 --> 23:20.547
printed some 7, 8, 10,000 of these programs. We did 
nothing. We called back down to go back by daylight

23:21.649 --> 23:27.997
the next morning or by 8 or 9 o'clock the next 
morning. We had a correct set, properly spelled

23:28.477 --> 23:35.306
posthumously. So that kind of put us in a bind. It 
was a pressure deal, obviously, all the time,

23:37.278 --> 23:44.265
because it was a pressure on the faculty. Because 
the students were there, and they were

23:44.285 --> 23:49.190
particularly students who had difficulties. 
They were there bugging them and trying to get the

23:49.210 --> 23:56.818
professor to make a grade change, or let me write an 
extra paper. And they were working right up to this

23:56.878 --> 23:58.700
5 o'clock. One story that I'll never forget, and 
this involves your former department head of

24:00.321 --> 24:06.087
history, Dr. Nance. I will not mention the 
student's name because I don't think maybe I

24:10.746 --> 24:17.753
should. The student here was a very prominent 
former student and a prominent person in the

24:18.754 --> 24:33.390
state, son of this man.

24:35.092 --> 24:43.400
The interesting thing about this, I happened to be 
having lunch with Harry Green a week prior to the

24:35.092 --> 24:43.400
deadline for graduation. And this young man came 
by, and Harry introduced him to me. And he said, oh,

24:49.546 --> 24:51.889
I need to talk to you, Mr. Lacey. I need to know just 
exactly what to do to make certain that my

24:51.989 --> 24:56.613
graduation is OK. So I went through the rules with 
him. 5 o'clock comes on Thursday, and he hasn't

25:00.257 --> 25:03.580
cleared. because he has an elf in a history course. 
Well, we go on down to the printing center, and

25:08.452 --> 25:17.282
about 9 o'clock that night, I get a call from Dr. 
Williams. Hold up. We're going to do something.

25:22.508 --> 25:24.110
And we've got to find Dr. Nance. Well, you knowing 
Dr. Nance and his temperament, that kind of thing

25:25.591 --> 25:31.038
didn't sit well with him at all. But anyway, about 
midnight, They located Dr. Nance, and he was to

25:33.884 --> 25:41.071
retest this young man. Well, the next problem was 
they couldn't find the young man. So they finally

25:44.255 --> 25:53.384
found him about 3 o'clock in the morning up at the 
Dixie Chicken, and he was slightly on his way to a

25:44.255 --> 25:53.384
neighboration. But the test was given, and I'm 
still holding up. I'm still holding up on the

26:00.211 --> 26:02.794
printing. So I go on from the printing center about 
5 in the morning to the office. It's 6 o'clock.

26:09.471 --> 26:13.094
Somebody's knocking on the back doors of the 
Cokeville. And I open the door, and here's Milton

26:13.114 --> 26:21.381
Nance in a roar, highly upset. You know how red he'd 
get when he got angry. And he went through his

26:24.623 --> 26:28.947
philosophy about all this stuff, and I don't think 
he'd repeat that. But he had given an exam, and he

26:34.060 --> 26:36.744
And we were able to- He had a grade change. He had a 
grade change, and we were able to get his name in the

26:36.764 --> 26:40.108
program. And Dr. Williams, I also remember that. I 
mean, he said, look, I've done a lot of things,

26:45.896 --> 26:55.549
talking to this particular gentleman, I've done a 
lot of things, but this is the limit. Don't ask me

26:56.170 --> 26:58.072
anymore. I suspect you recall that circumstance.

27:02.900 --> 27:07.325
Let's see, commencement speakers, do you have any 
favorites that you remember? Oh, Len Ashby. I

27:09.507 --> 27:11.109
thought you had no doubt about it. Absolutely. You 
know, we had him here at least twice, maybe three

27:13.172 --> 27:17.336
times. Oh, I just remember I knew all about one. I 
believe he's been here twice. I believe he's been

27:21.481 --> 27:24.004
here twice, yes. I remember him with Dr. Williams 
particularly. Yes, yes. You know, he was a

27:26.997 --> 27:29.600
University of Texas graduate. He got a tremendous 
amount of respect for Texas A&M because of Jack

27:29.620 --> 27:34.085
Williams. He really introduced him here, and he's 
been quite complimentary.

27:43.776 --> 27:53.588
Do you remember any prima donnas who kind of acted 
uppity as commencement speakers? Oh, Dr.

27:54.629 --> 27:55.570
DeBakey. That would have been my choice too. Not 
any question about it. That he was doing us a favor

28:02.314 --> 28:04.457
by being here. Totally, totally. And acted as 
though he didn't enjoy him any more. One I had

28:11.164 --> 28:16.910
great, I felt great honor in working with was Leon 
Jaworski. You know, I remember when he was here,

28:16.930 --> 28:21.836
but when was that? It was in the Williams years. 
Late 70s? No, it may have been under Jarvis. I don't

28:27.157 --> 28:29.700
remember him as a speaker. I just remember him as a 
kind, thoughtful man who would not accept the fee.

28:37.087 --> 28:43.474
And I told him that we would then take his fee and 
make a scholarship out of it. And he then wrote a

28:43.494 --> 28:49.300
check equaling that fee to add to it. And I thought 
all the things that I've read about him, I... Let's

28:49.520 --> 28:55.206
see, do you remember... On the stage, do you 
remember any student doing anything, any prank or

28:56.688 --> 29:05.059
anything goofy on the stage? Oh, yes. The one that 
comes to mind immediately is the student that

29:06.381 --> 29:21.262
comes up to the, if you recall, that was an elevated 
stage and we had rather inclined steps going up to

29:06.381 --> 29:21.262
it. And so the student comes up to the bottom of the 
steps And he's on crutches and just hardly can walk

29:26.320 --> 29:31.787
on crutches. So a couple of our four workers there 
help him get up the steps and get him onto the stuff,

29:31.807 --> 29:42.600
get up the steps and onto the stage. And he wobbles 
out across the stage and just barely could get to

29:42.620 --> 29:48.908
the president. Just stuck his hand out very 
limber, very slowly. as though he were about to

29:53.995 --> 30:09.395
pass out at that moment, and the president handed 
him his diploma, shook his hand, and he threw down

29:53.995 --> 30:09.395
the crutches and jumped up and let out a whoop and 
took off running across the stage and left the

29:53.995 --> 30:09.395
crutches on the stage. That one I remember very 
well. All right, now the diploma presentation I

30:12.899 --> 30:23.192
remember most is the last one while I was employed 
here. The last commencement I attended was on

30:24.488 --> 30:29.436
Saturday morning in May of 1980. And this was a 
young woman getting a degree in biomedical

30:29.636 --> 30:36.146
sciences. And do you remember who I'm thinking 
about? I think you're talking, she was in the cadet

30:40.472 --> 30:42.415
corps. That's right. Describe, if you will, your 
recollection of what happened. All right, we're

30:49.686 --> 30:51.769
talking about Melanie Zingrass. That's right. 
Melanie Zingroup was a cadet. And

30:57.518 --> 31:07.891
when she walked up on the stage, Dr. Miller was 
president at that time. And of course, her name was

31:09.373 --> 31:12.537
called. Our commencement speaker had been 
Lieutenant Governor William P. Hobby. That I did

31:16.322 --> 31:17.443
not recall. Yes. All right. I think maybe that we 
need to possibly indicate that there were

31:21.610 --> 31:34.328
difficulties between Ms. Ingraf and the 
administration. Yes. And I recall it had to do with

31:35.990 --> 31:39.315
the
