WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:08.784
collected for Dr. Ball,

00:01.634 --> 00:08.784
were you paid for that on a piece basis? No, about 
twenty-five cents an hour. On an hourly basis? On

00:12.589 --> 00:15.593
an hourly basis, and that was the rate of pay in 
those days. What types of specimens did you

00:15.613 --> 00:17.335
collect? Oh, I would go out and collect rhizomes. I 
would collect shrubs and buds and various things

00:23.909 --> 00:34.257
that were used for the laboratory part of his 
botany classes.

00:39.215 --> 00:47.082
This was prior to the creation of the museum 
building, I think, here on campus, was it not? Oh,

00:47.102 --> 00:47.923
yes, yes. That's long before that. So none of your 
specimens ended up in the museum, I take it? No, I

00:53.668 --> 00:54.889
would think not. They ended up in the laboratory 
part of his classes and probably in the garbage or

00:54.909 --> 01:03.437
the wastebasket after the class was over.

01:07.641 --> 01:07.821
Okay.

01:17.318 --> 01:19.481
What types of things did you do in the swine farm? I 
fed swine, and I remember, among other things,

01:21.745 --> 01:44.541
many other things, I would move the swine from here 
to there, and all kinds of operations, repairing

01:21.745 --> 01:44.541
of fences, repairing of feeder troughs, etc. I 
remember very distinctly that when the dairy at

01:45.078 --> 02:07.015
that time, the creamer really, was actually 
dumping a lot of skim milk into the sewer line, and

01:45.078 --> 02:07.015
it was causing Mr. Zeller, P.J. Zeller, who was in 
charge of sewer disposal at that time, it was

02:10.441 --> 02:28.129
causing him troubles at the sewer disposal plants 
out here so he devised a means of precipitating the

02:10.441 --> 02:28.129
casein out of that skim milk so it wouldn't get into 
his sewage disposal area. And so we wondered if it

02:31.151 --> 02:39.225
couldn't be used possibly as a feed for swine. So I 
devised a little experiment, and we set up and

02:39.907 --> 02:46.438
carried that experiment through. And it fed it at 
two different levels. And it proved to be a very

02:49.844 --> 02:53.449
excellent feed, as a matter of fact. And I suppose 
that's my first research experiment that I ever

02:54.050 --> 02:58.937
did. This swine herd that you were working with, 
was that used in the Agricultural Experiment

02:58.977 --> 03:04.986
Station? No, no. In those days, as you know, until 
about 1947, I think, the teaching

03:06.047 --> 03:18.585
herds were all completely independent. of the 
research. And so the research swine herd was out at

03:20.607 --> 03:27.536
what we call the F&B. It's out where the old part of 
the dairy center is, just out past where the water

03:27.696 --> 03:38.591
tank is out there. And then the swine teaching farm 
was located right out here, as I say, right on the

03:39.232 --> 03:47.643
top of this hill. The golf course. The golf course, 
where the golf course is. So these swine were used

03:50.830 --> 03:55.017
in the animal science teaching? Teaching, 
strictly, yes. Well, did the students do research

03:56.860 --> 04:02.009
with them, or in what aspect of teaching were they 
used? No, they made it possible. What they did,

04:06.337 --> 04:10.003
they took. for income for the animal husbandry 
department, they collected the garbage from

04:11.333 --> 04:20.590
Spiesel Hall. And they brought it out to the swine, 
among other things. Now, they didn't do it all that

04:25.319 --> 04:27.182
way. but they had a fairly large group of swine that 
they fed this garbage to. Well, we were able to pick

04:33.691 --> 04:51.516
out of this group, pick out the animals and match 
them up that we could put on this little test for the

04:33.691 --> 04:51.516
whey, the precipitated whey from the skim milk. 
That's how. As far as I know, that was the only

04:53.523 --> 04:57.690
experiment that was conducted of that sort. Then 
did the department sell parts of the herd as they

04:58.130 --> 05:05.781
reached proper weight? Yes, always. The income 
from the sale of the herd went right back into the

05:06.683 --> 05:12.912
department of budget, yes. Then did Animal 
Husband Department have other... I take it they

05:19.101 --> 05:20.423
had a... a dairy herd and other livestock which 
they used for the same purpose? No, there was a

05:25.232 --> 05:27.474
separate dairy department. And there was, the 
dairy department had the dairy herd. But there

05:31.778 --> 05:45.790
was, the animal husbandry department had the 
swine, had beef, and the beef barn was located

05:31.778 --> 05:45.790
right where the Herman Heath building is now, 
right back of the judging pavilion. And let's see,

05:46.451 --> 05:51.135
they had sheep and goats. And these were the 
animals, I guess, that the Animal Husbandry

05:51.115 --> 05:55.681
Department had. Sheep and Goat Center was over 
where the dormitory area, these 12 dormitories

05:55.941 --> 06:04.152
are over here. The Corps of Cadets dormitories. 
Yeah, right, right. Okay, did any of this

06:08.918 --> 06:16.228
livestock from Animal Husbandry

06:19.634 --> 06:21.723
Was it ever served in a dining hall? I mean, did you 
sell it to what would now be food services? Do you

06:26.060 --> 06:27.687
remember?

06:29.287 --> 06:30.329
I don't remember. I doubt if it did, because there 
was no processing plant. See, it would have had to

06:37.220 --> 06:39.123
have been processed. I see. And so it was probably 
sold to, I guess I shouldn't use these names,

06:40.245 --> 06:48.038
Armour, Swift, or Wilson or something. 
Commercial. Commercial processing, yeah. So the

06:50.943 --> 06:54.349
meat lab then is a more recent process. Yes, yes 
indeed. You see, the meat lab was, I graduated from

06:55.955 --> 07:07.292
A&M in 1931, and this building where the meats lab 
is, including the meats lab, was built in 1933.

07:07.492 --> 07:13.080
Let's see.

07:19.928 --> 07:24.416
In 31, when you graduated then, you, I believe, 
went to the University of Illinois. Right. For a

07:25.358 --> 07:26.019
master's. I had intended, since I'd had to borrow, 
and incidentally, the swine herdsman, a man by the

07:26.239 --> 07:35.035
name of Chrysler, had loaned me, I couldn't make 
the 25 cents an hour, just couldn't make my way

07:35.015 --> 07:43.910
through college. And so he had loaned me and I owed 
him a little bit of money when I graduated. And I was

07:49.800 --> 07:55.851
going out and work for a year and pay that back 
before I went to graduate college. I had

07:56.292 --> 07:58.896
definitely planned all of my coursework. to go to 
graduate college. This I knew. I was going to

08:01.000 --> 08:03.385
graduate school. But I did this. But there 
absolutely, as far as I could find, there was

08:06.311 --> 08:11.181
absolutely no jobs. available anywhere in 1931. 
So I waited and waited. I turned down. I had an

08:17.364 --> 08:27.760
opportunity for an assistantship or two at other 
institutions during the latter part of my senior,

08:17.364 --> 08:27.760
the last semester of my senior year. I turned them 
down because I thought I had to get a job and I wanted

08:28.180 --> 08:34.350
to pay this money back before I went to graduate 
college. Well, it came June and July and still no

08:34.330 --> 08:51.360
job and so it just happened that an assistantship 
at the University of Illinois became available

08:34.330 --> 08:51.360
and the man that had accepted it became ill and 
could not go on to school. And so they notified the

08:58.496 --> 09:05.683
people here the availability of this 
assistantship. And I was notified about it. And so

09:08.426 --> 09:13.871
I immediately made application and was fortunate 
enough to get the assistantship. In those days,

09:13.891 --> 09:16.053
there weren't many assistantships. And so I was 
very fortunate. And that's how I happened to go. I

09:20.315 --> 09:32.370
had planned to go to the University of Illinois 
anyhow, but it happened that this assistantship

09:20.315 --> 09:32.370
was in genetics, and I had planned to go there to 
major in nutrition. So you had to make a change of

09:34.392 --> 09:36.855
plans. Yes, sir. Why did you choose the University 
of Illinois? Majorly because one of the

09:42.742 --> 09:59.084
professors that I liked and respected on the staff 
here was a graduate of Illinois and knew the people

09:42.742 --> 09:59.084
and told me a lot about some of the people. And I had 
read about H.H. Mitchell who was fairly well known

10:03.511 --> 10:08.918
in the field of protein nutrition. at the 
University of Illinois. So again, it was a matter

10:10.885 --> 10:20.798
of people making the choices as making the choice 
to come to A&M. So you went there and you had an

10:21.200 --> 10:25.246
assistantship in genetics. Did that require you 
to major in genetics? Yes, animal genetics, but I

10:30.453 --> 10:35.080
took as many or more courses. My major professor 
was quite liberal, and I took more courses,

10:35.821 --> 10:48.439
probably, in fact I know, more courses in 
nutrition than I did in genetics, so I really ended

10:35.821 --> 10:48.439
up with a joint major between the fields of 
nutrition and genetics. Now, at this point, were

10:54.014 --> 10:59.790
you specializing in poultry or did that come even 
later? No, no. disciplines were independent of

11:02.628 --> 11:08.616
animal commodity commitments. And I took some 
courses under the Dr. Leslie Card, who was the head

11:09.417 --> 11:22.595
of the poultry section of the animal husbandry 
department at the University of Illinois. It was

11:23.276 --> 11:24.858
all in one department there. They weren't divided 
up. And I took some coursework in poultry with the

11:26.000 --> 11:39.532
idea that my commitment in nutrition or in 
genetics would require a commodity field. And so

11:39.552 --> 11:55.045
taking the courses in poultry, it prepared me then 
to go into the poultry area when I went into a

11:39.552 --> 11:55.045
commodity grouping. After you finished your 
master's, you went directly into a PhD program?

12:00.088 --> 12:00.308
Yes. In fact, I did not take a master's degree. I 
went right straight on through. I see. And

12:08.458 --> 12:16.008
had you finished your dissertation and 
everything before coming to Texas A&M? No. Again,

12:16.439 --> 12:21.846
circumstances dictates sometimes what we do. The 
man that was in charge of animal genetics at Texas

12:22.927 --> 12:36.545
A&M accepted a job at the University of Arkansas, 
effective at mid-semester, February 1st. And I

12:37.506 --> 12:42.292
was due to graduate, get my degree in June of 1930. 
This had been 1936. And so I applied and received an

12:46.510 --> 12:55.259
appointment to the position here. So I came in 
February of 1936 and taught. I taught five

12:59.343 --> 13:02.986
courses. And I really hadn't any experience in 
teaching. That was quite an experience to me to try

13:07.611 --> 13:14.998
to develop the course outlines and teach five new 
courses. for the second semester of 1936. And then

13:19.164 --> 13:26.715
I went back to Illinois in the summer, in June of 36, 
and finished my degree at the end of summer. So at

13:26.735 --> 13:34.306
that point, coming as a brand new instructor with 
five different courses, I imagine you were lucky

13:26.735 --> 13:34.306
to keep a day ahead of the students. I doubt if I did. 
I doubt if I did. I think I'd be bragging if I said I

13:37.171 --> 13:41.577
did. Okay, and what information I had been able to 
pick up, you taught genetics. Yes, yes, genetics,

13:47.576 --> 13:56.310
and I also had two courses in human heredity with 
the principles of genetics. I taught one course in

13:56.390 --> 13:59.455
principles of genetics. I taught one course in 
animal genetics. And I taught two courses in human

14:04.625 --> 14:08.409
heredity. One to non-people who had not had 
genetics. They were engineers and architecture

14:13.495 --> 14:17.520
majors and so on. And then another one was in human 
heredity to those who had had genetics. Now, was

14:25.209 --> 14:29.053
this in the animal husbandry department? No. No, 
there was a separate department of genetics in

14:29.534 --> 14:32.978
those days, yes. At what point was that 
discontinued, do you remember?

14:41.037 --> 14:51.911
It was discontinued about 19—I

14:41.037 --> 14:51.911
think about 1947 or 48. I think there was still a 
genetics department.

15:00.515 --> 15:13.974
When I came back from Hawaii, I was gone from A&M for 
about almost two years, and I came back in the

15:00.515 --> 15:13.974
poetry department here in 1947.

15:20.544 --> 15:24.750
During the 36 to 45 that you were in genetics, Were 
you head of the genetics department? No, no, no,

15:28.808 --> 15:29.449
no. You were on the faculty of that department. No, 
I was the professor of animal genetics. Within the

15:33.275 --> 15:34.918
genetics department. Department, right, right. 
Okay. Then, I believe in 45, you went to Hawaii.

15:43.031 --> 15:46.336
Yes, I went to Hawaii as head of the poaching 
department. Did

15:46.396 --> 15:52.746
you choose to go there because it was a step up? No, 
it was a step up, distinctly so, but I don't believe

15:55.392 --> 16:04.765
that was the major motivating factor. The major 
motivating factor was that I had never been happy.

16:13.533 --> 16:15.576
A&M was separate. Research was in one area and 
teaching was in another. And I had been in the

16:20.342 --> 16:24.608
teaching area solely. And I wanted to do both 
teaching and research. For graduate students,

16:28.773 --> 16:31.817
you've got to have both, you see. And I wanted to 
emphasize the upper levels as much as I could. And

16:36.583 --> 16:38.947
so for that reason, I'd never been happy. And I had 
agitated and talked openly. that they ought to be

16:42.271 --> 16:50.467
combined so that we could grow graduate 
student-wise at A&M, but it had never come to be.

16:50.507 --> 17:03.773
And so when I was offered the job in Hawaii in 1945, I 
accepted it and resigned, turned in my

16:50.507 --> 17:03.773
resignation from Texas A&M University. The dean 
called me in when the resignation passed the

17:03.753 --> 17:09.059
dean's desk. He called me into his office and told 
me that there'd already been enough talk. He asked

17:14.384 --> 17:16.446
me why I was resigning. And I told him that the major 
reason was I could do both teaching and research.

17:21.592 --> 17:23.854
They were all combined in a way. And there would be 
no problem. And in fact, all three of them were

17:26.136 --> 17:30.061
together, teaching and research. And so he said, 
well, there's been enough talk. that when the war

17:33.723 --> 17:49.713
is over, there's an extremely strong probability 
that the teaching and research will be combined,

17:33.723 --> 17:49.713
and agriculture will be combined here at Texas A&M 
University. And would you take a leave of absence

17:50.394 --> 17:56.085
rather than resigning under that condition? And 
so I wrote the dean and director at Hawaii and asked

17:56.268 --> 18:04.860
him if I could do this. And he said, yes, indeed, it 
would be all right for me to do it. And so then I

18:09.612 --> 18:12.054
changed. They destroyed my resignation, and I 
turned in a leave request for a year's leave

18:12.655 --> 18:22.865
without pay to take the position. And then I had to 
turn in a second year leave at the end of the first

18:22.885 --> 18:29.712
year that I was gone. And so that was a motivating 
factor, I think, to do that.

18:36.245 --> 18:43.818
As of 1945, though, you did have a considerable 
amount of graduate work in agriculture. Yes, yes.

18:45.020 --> 18:45.641
Oh, yes. But most of the departments stopped. Not 
all of them, but most of them stopped at the

18:50.790 --> 18:59.485
master's degree because, you see, the research 
was done in the experiment stations. And so a

19:00.595 --> 19:16.595
graduate student, most of the teaching 
departments could possibly afford enough

19:00.595 --> 19:16.595
facility for a master's research program, but not 
for a dissertation program. So if the student was

19:16.976 --> 19:29.792
going to the PhD, they almost had to be adopted by a 
full-time research worker in the experiment

19:16.976 --> 19:29.792
station. There were no joint appointments then as 
now, I take it. I don't know of any if there were.

19:36.110 --> 19:39.635
There may have been a few, but there were very few, 
if any. They were one or the other. So you say a PhD

19:42.299 --> 19:49.510
almost had to be adopted by the experiment 
station. So then, at that point, if someone went on

19:49.530 --> 19:56.320
for a PhD, he would have an academic advisor in the 
department, I would take it, and research advisor

19:57.093 --> 20:00.997
in the experiment station. They just weren't many 
went on that way. It would have to have been a...

20:03.520 --> 20:07.665
That's the way it would have had to have been, yes, 
indeed. Now, it's... There's one further word. I

20:12.050 --> 20:17.796
taught in the genetics department from 1936 to 45. 
I taught genetics for nine months. And then if I had

20:22.017 --> 20:27.867
graduate students, I continued the advising of 
the graduate students. But for the summer months,

20:28.368 --> 20:34.559
I went to the experiment station and did research 
for three months. Was that a fairly common

20:34.999 --> 20:39.166
practice for the faculty in agriculture? Not very 
common. Not very common. I had to write a project.

20:43.516 --> 20:50.563
for the experiment station, and they had to 
construct a building for the research to be done.

20:50.584 --> 20:57.411
And so I think I got a little bit of favor to be able to 
do it. Were you then doing poultry research in

20:57.871 --> 21:03.037
those summers? No. My research was mostly with 
rats.

21:11.045 --> 21:12.747
Mr. Hale, Fred Hale, had been doing some work on low 
vitamin A and its relation to eyelessness in

21:12.912 --> 21:20.962
swine. And I had a strain. I was carrying on a colony 
of rats in my genetics laboratory here in the

21:24.106 --> 21:31.355
instructional area. And I had an eyeless strain of 
rats. And I was anxious to know whether the

21:37.263 --> 21:46.880
genotype that caused the eyelessness in these 
rats was influenced by nutrition. And so you see

21:47.321 --> 21:56.638
that brought a commonness of interest there, and 
so it became relatively easy. to get approved from

21:57.023 --> 22:03.974
the experiment station for a summer appointment 
and to carry my work over. But to continue and

22:04.515 --> 22:11.626
discontinue was, of course, not like being 
continuous for 12 months. Yeah. So your research,

22:13.849 --> 22:18.316
you could really concentrate on your research for 
three months. Yes. Obviously, you'd have to carry

22:19.859 --> 22:25.107
it on for the other nine months, sort of. as time was 
available, I think. Right. But when you went to

22:29.751 --> 22:39.165
Hawaii, you had both research and, well, you had 
actually research, teaching, and extension all

22:29.751 --> 22:39.165
combined. Yes, right. And so they were all in one 
department, and I taught one course in poetry

22:40.867 --> 22:54.267
science, and the rest of my time was spent on 
research.

22:57.048 --> 23:17.289
Then, after two years, or about two years in 
Hawaii, you came back to Texas A&M as head of the...

22:57.048 --> 23:17.289
As head... Now, I was offered the job to come back at 
Texas A&M University as the man who had been head of

22:57.048 --> 23:17.289
the teaching department had retired. And I was 
offered to come back as head of the teaching

23:18.610 --> 23:25.958
department, but I would not accept the position 
unless I came back on a joint appointment between

23:26.495 --> 23:33.444
research and teaching. And I was offered this 
joint appointment and I came back as head of the

23:34.265 --> 23:41.855
teaching department in September, 1st of 
September. In November, the research,

23:42.315 --> 23:48.503
extension, and teaching were all combined. And at 
that time, I really asked that somebody else take

23:49.164 --> 23:54.831
the headship. But I was asked to do it and almost was 
urged to do it, and so I did assume the headship of

23:55.300 --> 24:08.854
all three areas as of November. I guess it probably 
came effective December 1. I'm not sure of the

24:12.598 --> 24:14.320
exact timing. So at that point, people who had been 
in poultry science research in the Experiment

24:14.340 --> 24:23.249
Station came under your direction. Right, right. 
And then the poultry specialists in the extension

24:24.713 --> 24:30.368
service also came under you. Yes. So they could do 
some teaching in addition to what other work they

24:30.809 --> 24:35.060
were doing. Yes. And people who had been teaching 
exclusively... were freed some teaching load to

24:40.087 --> 24:44.054
do some amount of research. Right. Actually, the 
department at that time, the extension has not

24:44.916 --> 24:50.246
changed very much. There were four specialists. 
There are four specialists here, local

24:53.011 --> 24:56.998
specialists, resident specialists, and one 
field spaceless at the present time. So the

24:59.804 --> 25:02.890
extension area has not changed. As a matter of 
fact, there's reason for that because there was

25:02.950 --> 25:08.801
tremendous numbers of flocks and the extension 
was needed. Perhaps the spaceless were needed in

25:09.262 --> 25:18.801
those days as much as today where there's much more 
poultry in the state. But they're in large units,

25:18.882 --> 25:29.581
much fewer people carrying on the poke industry of 
the state, although it's many times the size it was

25:18.882 --> 25:29.581
then. And so there has been little or no change 
there. But the staff, there had to be a staff built

25:33.668 --> 25:38.397
for teaching and research. And so it increased 
from a total of 2,000. it increased a total of five

25:44.482 --> 25:55.681
to a total of thirteen in about a three-year 
period. What is the poultry science department

25:55.701 --> 25:59.968
now teaching and research? There's one less 
position than there was two years ago. There was

26:04.698 --> 26:06.781
one position that was dropped. That's all I know as 
far as I know. So did it remain at 13 or from, say you

26:08.644 --> 26:15.775
said it rose from 5 to 13 within three years. This 
would be, say, like 46 to 49. Right. Did it remain at

26:19.281 --> 26:23.687
the level of 13 quite steadily throughout? Yes, 
yes. There was no positions dropped. or none

26:27.935 --> 26:29.076
added. Yes, I take it back. There was one position. 
I better revise that because I was counting today.

26:36.624 --> 26:37.945
There was twelve. It rose to twelve. There was one 
added in nineteen and forty, let's see, nineteen,

26:39.247 --> 26:47.675
is that it? Yeah, about 1971, I think. There was a 
new environmental control position added. in

26:57.854 --> 26:58.775
1971. So

26:58.876 --> 27:06.787
it did increase by one position. What about the 
course offerings within the Department of

27:06.807 --> 27:12.516
Poultry Husbandry, now Poultry Science? Was that 
expanded considerably between, say, 46 and 72?

27:19.268 --> 27:23.412
Yes, it was expanded in two ways. The courses in 
poultry genetics and the course in poultry

27:25.094 --> 27:44.753
nutrition and the course in poultry management 
were all offered by the same man,

27:25.094 --> 27:44.753
or taught by the same man. in 1945, really. And now, 
of course, each one of those is offered by one or two

27:48.926 --> 27:59.164
independent people. And there's been other 
courses added, and these courses that were added

27:59.515 --> 28:15.744
have been added only to be taught by individuals 
who were trained in that specialized area. So

28:17.186 --> 28:23.397
there's been a change in terms of numbers of 
courses, and there's been a change in the

28:23.731 --> 28:31.935
background of training of the man in charge of the 
course himself.
