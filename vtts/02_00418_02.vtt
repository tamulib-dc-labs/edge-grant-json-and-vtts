00:04.250 --> 00:09.015
Ah, well, it's the tree, someone was hit by that 
tree. That one. Yes, it's a tree that still exists,

00:09.916 --> 00:13.880
that tree is still there, when he was little. What 
happened? They hit him, they wanted to hang him on

00:16.442 --> 00:19.405
that stick. Yes, they wanted to, they hit him. 
That's what I was telling you before, that these

00:22.728 --> 00:30.116
people went to the movies at night. Yes. They told 
one, That night they took chivas, cows, oxen and

00:34.203 --> 00:43.692
everything. They made cattle and took them away. 
And they say, tomorrow if you want to go and claim

00:45.814 --> 00:58.205
your animals, go to Cerro Culano, there's a road 
there, so they can deliver them. Lies. There was a

00:59.706 --> 01:03.990
town called El Jaral, retired from there. My 
father told a friend of mine, he said, for me, these

01:05.017 --> 01:18.436
people, these are not zombies, they don't know 
what kind of people they are. Let's go, let's go and

01:18.476 --> 01:19.978
follow the animals. Well, let's go, and they left. 
They left until they got to that village, to that

01:26.086 --> 01:29.952
village called Jaral. Well, they got there in the 
afternoon, And in the afternoon, because there in

01:35.341 --> 01:43.491
the village they also have cattle, they made them 
there, they have a lot of places to lock them up. And

01:44.091 --> 01:48.396
they went down the street, like here in Bryan. 
Well, they went down the street and the animals, as

01:49.418 --> 01:56.225
they did not know, they went and shouted and how 
much. And my father said to him, compadre, these

01:57.587 --> 02:05.196
animals, I'm sure they are not from here, because 
they are screaming a lot. Brahman or something

02:05.598 --> 02:10.022
like that. Let's see. And they went to see. And they 
found one that had two, two Chivas that they call

02:14.847 --> 02:20.513
them in Mexico. They are Chips, I think. Well, they 
found him and they looked.

02:30.783 --> 02:35.267
And they brought, because in Mexico, everyone 
sends a signal to their animals. Like here, they

02:35.551 --> 02:38.335
also put iron or something. And then he said, where 
are you taking those animals? I said, if I take them

02:43.804 --> 02:45.828
to kill, they sold them to me. He said, those 
animals are mine.

02:51.998 --> 02:53.320
And they took them away. And one stayed with the 
animals, those that he brought, and the others...

03:03.698 --> 03:05.781
And the other one went to see those animals. And 
they went to ask for help from the people, they were

03:07.043 --> 03:10.869
in the village, to help them. And they said, yes, 
right now they did the simulation, because they

03:11.009 --> 03:16.677
were the same people from there. It's the same 
people who stole. Those, as they had caravans and

03:20.302 --> 03:26.892
horses, they went out to steal elsewhere and they 
came and sold the animals. And there they have,

03:26.912 --> 03:31.659
very in order, like here in the village. We make an 
appearance. The employees bring guns, and they

03:34.090 --> 03:38.535
can go to... They gather 4 or 5, and they go and rob a 
bank or whatever, and here they are in the day.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.167
They're doing it there. Yes. What help did they 
have? One who lived in the ranch there didn't have

03:51.910 --> 03:59.238
any help, because there wasn't any. Let's see, 
when he brought a reason to the people, If it's two

04:05.512 --> 04:11.501
hours away, it's too late when they come to help. 
And all that, without a phone, without anything,

04:11.521 --> 04:24.480
you know? I think there were phones,

04:24.620 --> 04:33.493
but I think only those who had a lot of money had 
that. Because I never remember that there was a

04:35.279 --> 04:39.805
school in the ranch. I don't remember that there 
was a school

04:39.825 --> 04:49.356
there. We grew up, we went to work, to help my 
father. And the time has passed since there was no

04:53.522 --> 05:00.170
work, as there is no work here anymore. It's just in 
the house.

05:04.777 --> 05:16.449
I grew up without any letters, and there

05:04.777 --> 05:16.449
are many people still like that. And

05:16.549 --> 05:30.683
after you When he left his ranch, did he have 
letters or cards or other things with his family

05:33.430 --> 05:43.081
there? Yes, when I came here, yes, I looked for 
someone to give me a letter to write to my father.

05:49.008 --> 05:51.290
Because he was the only one who lived there. My 
mother had died when I was there. Your mother

05:53.833 --> 05:56.817
was... My mother died. My father lived there. And I 
wrote to my father from here. And I lost my

06:04.615 --> 06:10.982
direction and it didn't last long. It lasted a long 
time without writing, without knowing,

06:11.082 --> 06:18.291
without anything. And I came to find the direction 
of my brother, because there was a boy who was

06:18.311 --> 06:25.840
working in Camino Fierro. He was six years old, 
working in Camino Fierro. And that boy was

06:30.145 --> 06:32.327
practicing from Salamanca.

06:34.889 --> 06:36.530
And that's when I asked him. And he told me that his 
mother had... that she was going to sell something

06:36.550 --> 06:45.258
for the ranch. He said, I'm going to ask her to see if 
she has her brother. The next time he wrote, he

06:50.923 --> 06:54.365
said, write to my mother. I'm going to ask her to see 
if she has her

06:54.426 --> 06:59.930
brother. And that's how I found my brother's 
address. Yes. The last time I went. He didn't last

07:06.462 --> 07:12.770
long, about a year or two. He died, he was killed 
too. He died? He was killed. He was killed? His...

07:19.378 --> 07:21.520
Him and two real children on the same day. His 
brother was killed? Who? Do you know what it would

07:23.203 --> 07:27.267
be like? That's what my brother-in-law says.

07:34.136 --> 07:34.977
Soldiers? No. No, and now it's been a little while. 
In what year did they kill him? I don't know. I don't

07:44.913 --> 07:47.095
know. It's been more than five years, yes. He was on 
the road to hell, right? Yes. No, it's been about 15

07:55.323 --> 07:57.344
years, I think. 15 years ago? Because they were 
coming, they didn't know they were coming from

07:59.326 --> 08:02.729
there. It's been about 15 years. They killed three 
of them in the same day. Three? Three. The boys are

08:11.487 --> 08:12.609
already old. That was the father, who is now his 
brother. He was the father, and he had a son

08:16.294 --> 08:22.342
married, leaving because he had three families. 
And he had a boy, a 17-year-old boy. They killed the

08:25.727 --> 08:28.251
three of them. Who? Well, who knows who it would be, 
and who knows why it would be. We don't know. And

08:33.894 --> 08:36.796
this is only five years ago? Fifteen years. 
Fifteen years. Yes, fifteen years. Fifteen

08:40.460 --> 08:41.060
years. And in which part? In Salamanca? In 
Salamanca. In Salamanca, in the city? Yes, there.

08:47.405 --> 08:48.646
In their house? In the ranch. Oh, it was in the 
ranch. Yes, because they lived in the ranch. In

08:52.750 --> 08:54.131
their house? No. No. It was like a little village. 
According to my sister-in-law, it was... I don't

09:01.898 --> 09:02.278
know. There were some shops. They were 
celebrating something. I don't know what they

09:09.226 --> 09:14.973
were celebrating, but they were going to a party. 
It was like a party, something like that. And they

09:17.756 --> 09:22.041
were killing them. The three of them? The three of 
them. But no one knows who? Yes, they knew who it

09:29.429 --> 09:31.371
was. But I didn't know how much time it took for the 
man. Because they told me this time that he was

09:37.554 --> 09:41.239
going out. Yes. That man, that man must have taken 
him from bad to his 30 or 40 years in prison. Well, he

09:49.388 --> 09:53.473
shot three, killed him in a little while, three. 
Well, he must have taken him. Yes. If not, if he

09:56.376 --> 09:59.420
couldn't take more. But, because here the law 
punishes a lot. Here there are some who are 90 years

10:03.194 --> 10:09.421
old, because that's the house of a man. The one who 
is 90 years old, what defense does he have? Here,

10:15.228 --> 10:20.595
he's just going to die there. In what way? With a 
gun? With a gun. During the party? Yes. Are there

10:27.443 --> 10:33.009
problems like this during the holidays? Yes, it's 
like here. Like here, well, let's say like here.

10:40.276 --> 10:43.179
Well, there are the canteens of the people. There 
they make a plate, well, they kill one or two, and

10:43.199 --> 10:48.624
that's how it happened to them there. I think it 
would be outside or in the canteen, I don't know. My

10:55.372 --> 10:58.075
sister-in-law almost never talked to me about it. 
But there are problems like this here in Bryan.

11:02.879 --> 11:03.379
Yes. In the canteens. In the canteens. In the 
ranch, no. Where we went, there are no canteens.

11:11.887 --> 11:13.369
No. They are in the village. The canteens are in the 
village. There was a little part over there, there

11:17.292 --> 11:21.736
was one, but it was also removed. But the people are 
there. Y el pueblo más cerca está Salamanca. Sí.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.244
Pero esta fiesta estaba en el rancho. Estaba en el 
rancho, sí. Estaba en el rancho. ¿Hay fiestas en el

11:35.847 --> 11:40.431
rancho cuando usted estaba joven, ayer? Me 
acuerdo de una, de una que, que le hacían como,

11:40.451 --> 11:53.863
pues una fiesta que le nombraron la Virgen, ¿Qué 
sería? ¿Un pechín? ¿No? Pues una cosa así, ¿no? Yo

12:00.917 --> 12:09.947
me acuerdo que hacían una fiesta ahí, sería para el 
día 2, ¿de qué? De la Candelaria, ¿no? Yo creo que

12:12.410 --> 12:15.593
sí, es como en este mes. Febrero. Sí, en febrero. En 
este mes, sí. Candelaria, yo creo que sí.

12:21.619 --> 12:24.002
Candelaria.

12:25.855 --> 12:29.379
And what happened at the parties? Well, they just 
played and danced and everything. I don't

12:33.323 --> 12:34.284
remember what happened. And? And from there

12:34.525 --> 12:40.631
to there, I don't remember what happened. I saw 
another one and I don't know if it lasted or not. But

12:46.157 --> 12:48.880
once it happened. Once it happened. There was also 
a complaint. There

12:51.083 --> 12:55.828
was also a complaint because And I remember that I 
was in the middle and I stayed in the middle of the

12:56.180 --> 13:06.290
crowd, because that's how it was. Well, someone 
came from the past, I was there, he left me such a big

13:07.712 --> 13:17.642
knife, he gave it to me, the knife. Well, I raised 
it, I raised it, and he didn't come back anymore,

13:17.662 --> 13:22.947
and I left and I took it to my house. It was used to cut 
sticks and other things. It was very heavy. Yes. If

13:30.493 --> 13:34.598
they hit you with a machete, you hit your head a lot. 
Yes. And I took it home. And my brother, since he

13:37.622 --> 13:48.716
also had some chivas there that we had in the house, 
this one with him, he would hit the branches over

13:37.622 --> 13:48.716
there, the animals, the chivas. And one day the man 
who left me the knife said to me, I saw him. He said,

13:56.667 --> 14:00.231
he saw your knife and he showed it to you. He said, he 
saw it and he took it away. He took it away. But I

14:04.256 --> 14:10.282
remember that man in the kitchen left me that 
knife. There are so many. You treated all your

14:13.145 --> 14:15.208
family members. Let's see. There are so many. 
There are so many. There are so many. There are so

14:21.114 --> 14:21.935
many. There are so many. There are so many.

14:28.655 --> 14:29.396
These. And these too. Yes. These are the... Yes, 
those too. There are all of them. All of them are

14:38.269 --> 14:40.673
relatives. All of them are relatives, yes. All of 
them are nephews. Yes. And most of these nephews

14:49.486 --> 14:53.011
live in the city? Yes, they do. In Salamanca? Yes, 
in Salamanca. They live there. Do some of them live

14:58.068 --> 15:00.531
on the ranch? No, no, I don't think so. I don't have 
any idea. No, no, I don't think so. No, no, I don't

15:06.739 --> 15:07.680
have any idea. No, no, I don't have any idea. No, no, 
I don't have any idea. No, no, I don't have any idea.

15:13.407 --> 15:14.008
No, no, I don't have any idea. No, no, I don't have 
any idea. No, no, I don't have any idea. No, no, I

15:15.410 --> 15:16.191
don't have any idea. No, no, I don't have any idea. 
No, no, I don't have any idea. No, no, I don't have

15:18.734 --> 15:19.395
any idea. No, no, I don't have any idea. No, no, I 
don't have any idea. No, no, I don't have any idea.

15:22.259 --> 15:22.879
No, no, I don't have any idea. No, no, I don't have 
any idea. No, no, I don't have any idea. No

15:27.802 --> 15:30.947
No, no, that's not it. There's another

15:30.967 --> 15:53.159
one. Oh, my goodness. I'm a person. These are the 
ones that live in the ranchito, these ones still.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.763
They are very poor in the ranchito. But they don't? 
No, they all live in the town. In the town? Yes, in

16:10.534 --> 16:11.476
the town. And are they poor? No, no. Look at this 
Salvador, this one came here, this one. Yes, he

16:16.958 --> 16:18.680
came here and lived with us. He came here and lived 
with us. He came here and lived with us. He came here

16:20.762 --> 16:21.743
and lived with us. He came here and lived with us. He 
came here and lived with us. He came here and lived

16:24.927 --> 16:26.249
with us. He came here and lived with us. He came here 
and lived with us. He came here and lived with us. He

16:30.714 --> 16:31.495
came here and lived with us. He came here and lived 
with us. He came here and lived with us. He came here

16:33.197 --> 16:34.238
and lived with us. He came here and lived with us. He 
came here and lived with us. He came here and lived

16:36.180 --> 16:36.961
with us. He came here and lived with us. He came here 
and lived with us. He came here and lived with us. He

16:39.404 --> 16:40.245

with us. He came here and lived with us. He came here

16:41.907 --> 16:42.768
and lived with us. He came here and lived with us. He 
came here and lived with us. He came here and lived

16:44.630 --> 16:45.571
with us. He came here and lived with And this family 
on the ranch is the poorest? Yes, yes. They live on

16:52.877 --> 16:54.639
the ranch. This is my nephew, the man. Yes. The man 
is my nephew. And this is my sister-in-law. This is

17:02.928 --> 17:05.831
my sister-in-law. So you were the youngest in the 
family, or the eldest? Who, me? Yes. Of your

17:09.214 --> 17:10.816
siblings. There was one older than me, two. Two 
older than me. Two brothers? Two brothers. One

17:26.009 --> 17:30.254
sister and one brother older than me. And from 
there I had two brothers. One, the one over there,

17:33.999 --> 17:40.306
is younger than me. And one sister is younger than 
the other, and the last one too. How many were there

17:45.252 --> 17:47.595
for all of you? Five, right? Five, yes. Well, 
during these days,

17:50.547 --> 18:09.188
when I thought about going to the United States, do 
you remember what kind of thoughts I had? Well, I

18:10.690 --> 18:19.440
told my father that I wanted to come to the United 
States They also came from the ranch. They came

18:21.258 --> 18:24.241
from there, to the United States. I told them I 
wanted to come because they were going to come, and

18:25.742 --> 18:32.648
I didn't want to go with them. And I came. We all went 
through it. We all went through it. It's just that

18:39.473 --> 18:46.319
some of us went that way, others that way. Because 
some of us went back. In 1921, everything became

18:50.521 --> 19:00.169
more and more difficult because there was no work. 
The work started to run out and everything. And I

19:03.292 --> 19:10.398
also spent a lot of time that I didn't work. I 
settled down with a man there in Roquedero. And

19:15.363 --> 19:20.427
there I was working for a whole year without being 
paid anything, just giving me food. Y

19:20.744 --> 19:29.396
hasta que de allí me salí y me fui para las minas acá 
fue cuando ya empecé a trabajar yo.

19:33.362 --> 19:45.960
Pues en el primer año pensabas sobre volviendo a 
México, a su familia otra vez? Pues sí, pensaba ir

19:46.180 --> 19:48.744
para México. Sí. I thought that I couldn't go 
without taking a penny. How could I come here? I've

19:57.329 --> 20:00.933
been here for six or seven months. How could I come 
here without taking a penny? That's why I said that

20:05.317 --> 20:09.260
I'd better starve. Yes. That...

20:18.592 --> 20:20.274
How do you say it? To return to Mexico like this, 
without money. Yes. I didn't think it was right

20:25.602 --> 20:31.470
either to tell my father to send me money to go. It 
wasn't right. And that's why I wanted to go. And I

20:39.561 --> 20:47.873
didn't bring any papers or anything, and the 
immigration never investigated me for anything.

20:49.034 --> 20:55.222
until 1935

20:49.034 --> 20:55.222
or 1936. Around that time. I went to Laredo. Me and

21:00.850 --> 21:05.236
my wife. I had two girls.

21:10.042 --> 21:11.104
And I went to Laredo. And that was the first time the 
immigration department investigated me. papers

21:18.886 --> 21:20.588
and all that. I didn't know anything about papers. 
They did tell me, they did tell me, but the people

21:23.711 --> 21:33.099
who already lived here said, well, you need this, 
you need that to live here. Well, they didn't tell

21:33.119 --> 21:36.182
me anything. That time they investigated me, they 
let me go. And that's how I was born. They said they

21:40.887 --> 21:46.412
were going to put something in San Antonio, that 
they were going to Well, as you wish, they would

21:47.118 --> 21:56.812
just write to me directly from San Antonio, that

21:47.118 --> 21:56.812
would be all. Now, there was a year when they 
demanded that everyone who was not a citizen of

21:57.033 --> 22:10.593
here, that one had to fill out some cards that we are 
filling out every year. Yes. Every year we have to

22:11.173 --> 22:15.640
fill out those cards to know that we are still here. 
And the people who told me, because there were some

22:17.290 --> 22:34.252
who asked me when we got those papers, those cards, 
they said, how many years do you think you're going

22:17.290 --> 22:34.252
to stay here? Yes. Well, I'm going to stay 15 years 
or 20 or more. And I told them that I thought I was

22:41.121 --> 22:44.125
going to live here all my life. I think about living 
here all my life until I die. Well, the neighbors

22:50.147 --> 22:59.537
went to fill the blanks, and that's how it went. But 
they have told me, it will

22:59.557 --> 23:13.691
be true, that those who were told that they were 
going to live here for 15 years, 10 years, at 15

22:59.557 --> 23:13.691
years old they came and they were looking for them 
and they went to Mexico. Yes. Because that's what

23:14.032 --> 23:15.293
they have said. Because before, they didn't have 
passports or anything. There were passports when

23:22.855 --> 23:24.457
I passed. Yes. But back then, they just paid a 
nickel at the bridge and they passed to this side.

23:34.009 --> 23:36.712
They didn't need anything. Now it's very 
difficult because... It's very hard to get to

23:39.376 --> 23:42.319
Mexico. Yes. To get from there to here. From there. 
Also from here to there. Yes, because in the past

23:47.048 --> 23:52.678
they would scold you a lot. But now with the 
passport it's much easier. Yes, it's easier, but

23:58.367 --> 24:05.760
let's say that I take my Belize. Well, from there 
you have to open it to see what it takes and all that.

24:09.927 --> 24:11.470
It's the same here, wherever you want. Do you want 
to visit Mexico again? Well, who knows? I don't

24:23.631 --> 24:24.292
know. If there is a way, yes. If not, then... 
Because it costs a lot of money too. Yes. And do you

24:34.742 --> 24:38.266
want to visit Mexico again? Well, I would like to, 
but who knows? Who knows? She leaves here and comes

24:40.728 --> 24:44.292
back with 30 pesos. Yes, because my relatives are 
from Piedras Negras. In Piedras Negras? Yes,

24:51.541 --> 24:53.883
Rosita. Rosita,

24:53.903 --> 24:58.427
yes. No, my parents are very

24:58.468 --> 25:04.433
far away. They are very far away, that's why they 
didn't make it very hard for me, because we were in

25:04.714 --> 25:11.921
the airplane and soon we left. From there to here 
it's the same. We arrived very early in San

25:15.119 --> 25:20.307
Antonio. We stayed the whole day. We left at 5 in the 
morning from there, from Salamanca, in the bus, to

25:23.071 --> 25:31.044
come and take the plane to Guadalajara. It seems 
that at 1 in the morning, I don't know what time,

25:32.065 --> 25:42.882
like it was 9 and a half, we arrived in San Antonio. 
At 8 o'clock at night we would be here having dinner

25:43.503 --> 25:55.215
with the girls

25:43.503 --> 25:55.215
who came to bring us. Do you like life here more than 
in Mexico? Yes, it's better here. I'm more

26:00.341 --> 26:01.822
comfortable here. Because since I came here, 
well, I already told you that They would go at night

26:08.815 --> 26:18.325
and hit or beat someone. No one would come here to 
bother anyone. No one would come here to do their

26:21.769 --> 26:26.073
job. No one would come here to bother anyone. But 
there? There, yes. At night? At night. Now? Now, I

26:33.862 --> 26:38.046
don't know, but back then, yes. Yes. Since he's 
alone over there, he's alone. He's not like here.

26:45.451 --> 26:53.364
All the ranches that are there, here, it's 
different because anyone in the ranch has a phone.

26:53.384 --> 26:57.590
If something happened to him at home, he would call 
them. Yes. But over there, without a phone or

26:58.932 --> 27:01.857
anything.

27:08.603 --> 27:10.966
Yes, it's different. It was very hard at that time. 
And here, that's why I like to live. No revolution,

27:19.054 --> 27:21.176
no war, no nothing. I mean, over there, but far 
away. Here, no one has seen anything. Well, what do

27:28.865 --> 27:36.032
you think about the revolution in Mexico for these 
years in Mexico? Was it a good thing or not? I mean, I

27:39.974 --> 27:42.537
don't know.

27:45.220 --> 27:47.863
It's almost as if she wasn't very good either. 
Well, fighting with each other is good. Because

27:51.067 --> 27:53.730
with each other they are fighting. And I, why 
should I say no? We put an appearance

27:58.136 --> 28:07.707
here that says that I am here in my house. Yes. And 
that's his thing. Well, we're going to fight and

28:09.589 --> 28:11.892
we're fighting. Then I grab four or five to help me. 
Here it's the same. And the same because it's one

28:15.717 --> 28:18.800
game and another. Well, I think that the people in 
Mexico, not everyone has a studio or anything.

28:33.198 --> 28:34.780
That's why it's all that. Yes. That's why it was all 
that. They fought for nothing. The money, the

28:44.462 --> 28:50.188
money that was there, was never used. In the time of 
the revolution, the

28:50.209 --> 28:59.720
money was never used. The money that was there, if 
Villa was here in this town, he made a kind of... a

28:59.740 --> 29:09.752
kind of murder cards that had diamonds marked. It 
was paper. And from there they would smear it, what

29:13.058 --> 29:20.407
was it, nickel or diamond, they would smear it. The 
one that sold. That money, I don't know how, I

29:22.590 --> 29:30.780
grabbed it from behind, so that it was money, 
because they were papers, they were cardboard.

29:32.062 --> 29:35.286
Another one came and it lasted another month or two 
there in the town. And he put his money, the same, of

29:35.306 --> 29:40.633
another kind of money. Some

29:40.664 --> 30:08.072
people say that life in Mexico

29:40.664 --> 30:08.072
now is better for a lot of people because of the 
revolution. Yes, that's why. Do you think it's the

30:11.574 --> 30:14.517
truth? Well, I think it is, it is the truth. That 
because of the revolution, it became a bit...

30:20.204 --> 30:35.903
because all the men who had a lot of land... the farm 
had people working. And they worked the land and

30:35.923 --> 30:38.886
raised a lot more, beans, pumpkin, and all that. 
And when it was finished, when they picked up all

30:42.913 --> 30:50.763
the corn, there was nothing left that worked on the 
land. Everything was taken by the man, the owner of

30:51.424 --> 30:55.389
the land. All of it? There were no farms that had 
land? No, no. Not like here. Here, well, you have

31:04.139 --> 31:08.705
100 acres and you maintain them. Yes. And another 
one has 200 reais the same, but not there. There one

31:15.084 --> 31:20.591
only had all that land, a lot of land. So the 
revolution came doing this, after the revolution

31:20.611 --> 31:37.071
that came, it came distributing the land that the 
owner of the land wanted or didn't want, they were

31:20.611 --> 31:37.071
going to give a piece of land to each one there, and 
they marked them. so that whatever they raised

31:37.625 --> 31:42.410
there, they would keep it. And he too, he worked his 
land and he kept what he raised. That's what he did

31:47.456 --> 31:51.160
in Mexico, what they did in Mexico. To give a piece 
of land to everyone in the parts where they had a lot

31:51.220 --> 31:55.684
of land. And

31:55.704 --> 32:03.733
his brother still... My sister-in-law had a piece 
of land. She showed me a part of the land that she

32:09.483 --> 32:13.509
had. And she told me that the other part had been 
taken away because she was left

32:13.589 --> 32:24.404
alone. They took away another piece of land that 
had been given to her. And that land was given to her

32:27.789 --> 32:33.237
so that she could work and maintain it. They can't 
sell it. I don't think anyone else can sell

32:34.645 --> 32:46.072
it. Well...
