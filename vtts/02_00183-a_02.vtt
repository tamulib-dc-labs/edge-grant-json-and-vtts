00:01.870 --> 00:08.719
For four years, I worked with Ms. Walton, and she's 
one of the sweetest women I've seen in my life. And

00:09.540 --> 00:15.027
when I graduated, she gave me $25, which was a lot of 
money. Describe, in personality, describe the

00:17.049 --> 00:20.954
Waltons, both.

00:25.881 --> 00:29.245
Well, as I said, Ms. Walton was just like a mother. 
we always have something on that table. And that's

00:33.741 --> 00:44.620
where I learned that a president's wife has 
something more to worry about than what's on that

00:33.741 --> 00:44.620
flower table, what she has on the table. So that we 
made, I observed what she did as a president's wife

00:44.640 --> 00:54.878
and how she entertained and she'd tell me what she 
did. That was four years of good training with her.

00:58.486 --> 01:05.915
I learned a lot about what a present wife is 
expected to do other than being his wife. And I

01:06.776 --> 01:10.160
remember one night we bought flowers. I think we 
bought a dozen Picardy glass. It's that peach

01:14.345 --> 01:15.366
colored glass. And I guess somebody, must have 
been Eleanor Roosevelt or somebody came,

01:16.027 --> 01:22.975
somebody big. I know in that big living room with 
the whole house that burned was the most beautiful

01:23.191 --> 01:29.541
maroon carpet I thought I'd ever seen in my life. 
And I had thought I'd never seen that much of it

01:29.901 --> 01:32.265
before. And there was a beautiful crystal 
chandelier that hung over the stairway. And in one

01:37.032 --> 01:39.516
of the remodeling things, that thing just 
disappeared. I don't know where it went. Somebody

01:41.078 --> 01:44.443
said, well, it was put up in the attic, but it never 
was found. And it wasn't there when the house

01:45.385 --> 01:47.708
burned. They know that.

01:51.406 --> 01:52.607
Let me see what else. Describe Mr. Walton in 
personality. Well, he, as I remember him very

01:55.731 --> 02:02.720
much, he was bright bald and gray and a big round 
face. I didn't see him very often, except every now

02:04.281 --> 02:08.987
and then Ms. Walton went in passing and we'd see. 
But he knew that I was taking care of what she

02:09.708 --> 02:14.954
needed, and that's all he wanted to know, too. 
That's the way it goes, you know. But I learned

02:17.397 --> 02:19.860
right there. how you take care of a president's 
wife. And I was, you know, in Oklahoma, I was with

02:24.636 --> 02:33.664
Dr. Cross, Ms. Cross. He was present 25 years. And I 
took care, I knew right away that Ms. Cross, she was

02:37.067 --> 02:47.296
a great PR person much later than, I mean, the 
Waltons, you see. And that's when the president's

02:48.077 --> 02:49.358
wife was more active in a lot of things. And she 
could think of things that would make him look

02:52.949 --> 02:57.015
good. For instance, one Christmas, we had a 
student who grew a bunch of poinsettias. And she

03:01.622 --> 03:08.011
herself delivered those poinsettias to old 
retired faculty people for Christmas. And those

03:08.031 --> 03:11.136
people never forgot that. And she told me a long 
time before she retired, before I got here, she

03:11.336 --> 03:19.328
says, we'll miss the flowers. or anything we'll 
miss. And I learned again, I learned again that

03:21.827 --> 03:25.591
from Ms. Walton. It was Ms. Walton that taught me 
what to do and why. And that was real good training.

03:32.299 --> 03:43.712
And every time I went back to the campus, I went to 
see Ms. Walton and visited with her, and she'd ask

03:32.299 --> 03:43.712
me what I was doing and what I was doing. I would do 
the things she taught me to do. She loved that so

03:46.471 --> 03:48.653
much, which was right. It was true. She did a good 
job of it. And I'd

03:51.256 --> 04:04.772
go back to see her every time and visit with her and 
talk to her about how I appreciated all she'd done

03:51.256 --> 04:04.772
for me. And when she died, I was the only non-family 
member that was a pallbearer, which I cherish very

04:06.654 --> 04:14.003
much. All together, Mr. Walton was so busy, and he 
just, I didn't see much of him. Of course, you don't

04:26.542 --> 04:32.107
see much of a president, get it, back in those days. 
There was not that much emphasis on academics for a

04:33.128 --> 04:42.437
president as there was later. Where was the 
president's office in those years?

04:49.092 --> 04:49.492
Let's see. When did we get? Was it down in that what 
is now the Jack Williams building? Yes, it was.

04:58.203 --> 05:04.510
They had a big room with a fireplace in it. I 
remember that, oh yeah, that's where I first met,

05:06.599 --> 05:13.107
who was the last secretary down there, so long. 
I'll

05:14.809 --> 05:19.374
never forget her. Anyway, it was at that, also, you 
remember the beautiful stairway at Travertine

05:20.055 --> 05:28.905
Marble? It was so soft, people cut it with their 
fingernails. It ruined it.

05:36.265 --> 05:40.810
Let's see, when you were a student, the YMCA was a 
center of activity. Everything. That's where

05:41.411 --> 05:42.732
Yale practiced. They had Yale practice in front of 
that until I'll be in my senior year. And that got so

05:48.939 --> 05:54.585
big, they transferred it over to Henderson Hall, 
where the chimney sweeps came from. And it

05:55.325 --> 06:00.831
got so big that we couldn't handle it there 
anymore. I do remember. Do you remember Guyon

06:04.598 --> 06:06.281
Hall? Sure. Well, you know, there were two trees in 
that bed in front of Guyon Hall, Cedar Elms. And so

06:14.416 --> 06:25.276
they moved them, and we put one just to the, as you 
face the YMCA, we put one just to the right of the Y,

06:14.416 --> 06:25.276
Cedar Elm. It was still there the last time I knew. 
And then When they got ready to tear down Guyon, I

06:30.890 --> 06:36.336
begged them to. There's this beautiful columns, 
fluted-iron columns, and the tablature above

06:37.197 --> 06:52.674
said, Ignorance is the curse of God, knowledge of 
the wind will fly to the world, it will fly to heaven

06:37.197 --> 06:52.674
by Shakespeare. I begged them to say that the 
tablature or one of the columns or something as a

06:53.294 --> 06:59.361
memorial. And I was told that they didn't have 
enough money for that kind of food, so they took it

07:00.016 --> 07:05.463
down and threw it away. Every bit of it. What did you 
students do at the Y?

07:14.736 --> 07:17.600
Well, first of all, that was the Cases 
Confectionery. That's the only place you could

07:18.201 --> 07:21.145
get a drink on that whole area of town. And Cases 
Confectionery was good. You'd get sandwiches and

07:25.711 --> 07:28.555
things there, if you had any money. There was one 
telephone there, and you could use it just so long

07:29.294 --> 07:33.719
that you had to get off. And if you didn't get off, 
somebody got you off.

07:41.528 --> 07:44.691
And that was in the, just off the lobby of it. Why? 
And of course, there was no newspapers there and

07:45.873 --> 07:48.876
everything like that. And you could come, you 
could get over there and escape the sophomores

07:49.677 --> 07:53.862
sometimes. Were there some pool tables? Yes, and 
I'm trying to think where the, well, the pool table

07:56.581 --> 08:00.806
was in the basement. There at one time was a small 
pool down there, but I believe they'd covered it

08:01.086 --> 08:13.680
over and made a pool all

08:01.086 --> 08:13.680
out of it. Yeah, I'm sure, I think that's the time 
that they had done away with the pool. The pool was

08:17.464 --> 08:21.809
so small that you couldn't get in or out of it 
hardly. Did you know Mr. Cashin? Oh, yes. Describe

08:26.804 --> 08:27.866
him, please. I think the brother had a set over the 
land with any more glasses. And I

08:34.213 --> 08:41.622
knew this Red Cajun, yeah. He had two little boys. 
Yeah, two little boys. Yes, I knew Mr. Cajun. And he

08:49.873 --> 08:54.398
had a good program going there for the time. Those 
two little boys, did you see much of them on the

08:55.373 --> 09:00.179
campus, Red and Jim? I knew Red Cash because he 
played football. I couldn't remember the little

09:05.686 --> 09:07.769
boy's name if I had to. You said Jim, yeah. Jim 
played one year, then went away to the war, and then

09:11.053 --> 09:17.902
came back right after the war and played for Coach 
Norton. He's retired back there now. Oh, good.

09:21.800 --> 09:30.919
Let's see,

09:21.800 --> 09:30.919
were there religious activities at the Y? Yes. 
That's where Mr. Hensel's funeral was held, in the

09:34.607 --> 09:40.761
Y. When was that? You know, I can't tell you. I wrote 
all that up in a single... Was it after you were

09:44.408 --> 09:48.454
away? Oh, yeah, I was in Oklahoma. I got back for the 
funeral, and I remember I never will forget

09:50.598 --> 10:02.037
because all of a sudden the lens fell out of my right 
side and I had glasses, and I didn't have any

09:50.598 --> 10:02.037
glasses. Then we went over to Ms. Henson's for a 
meal, but...

10:10.720 --> 10:12.722
I forgot who the pallbearers were. I know I was not. 
Because they were not sure I'd get there in time.

10:19.711 --> 10:20.532
But that's all right. I kept up with Miss Ansel 
after that. Every time I'd go, I'd go see her

10:27.040 --> 10:29.844
regularly. And I'd take her something. And when 
she died, Bill said that you have been nicer to my

10:31.686 --> 10:40.677
mother than anybody else has. Of course, I was 
loyal to Ms. Jensel, and every now and then, Buddy

10:41.500 --> 10:54.260
Benz would give me an orchid or two, and I'd give 
them to her before we got the Benz school up there.

10:54.981 --> 10:56.944
See, that was another thing we did.

11:00.430 --> 11:05.838
Buddy Benz had the Benz School of Design and had 
written three books on it. He probably knew all

11:06.719 --> 11:07.761
that. Anyway, if you happen to see Jim Johnson, 
he's got it. He's done a fantastic job with that

11:12.534 --> 11:16.218
school of bed, school of design. And it was set up in 
a real will. He had that set up by a lawyer in the

11:19.722 --> 11:22.686
will. This I probably shouldn't tell you, but 
right after Ben's death, Mr. Dean Kunkel called us

11:23.366 --> 11:39.165
down and said, I want you to make an endowed 
scholarship, I mean endowed, professorship, and

11:39.668 --> 11:49.698
I'm going to use the rest of the money for 
biochemistry

11:39.668 --> 11:49.698
research. And I said, no, Dean, I'm sorry, but you 
can't have any of that money. And he said, why not? I

11:56.365 --> 12:00.870
said, because it's set up in the will, tied up, has 
to be spent. And if you violate the will, we won't

12:01.811 --> 12:06.276
get any of it. I said, even he knew. Buddy knew 
certain things like that disappeared around

12:07.799 --> 12:11.264
there. And I said, he had a large fan that fixed it 
tight where nobody could touch it except for that

12:11.284 --> 12:17.252
one purpose. And that's the way it's been. Thank 
goodness, because it has become now the school of

12:19.114 --> 12:25.743
floral design. In fact, see, Buddy and his two 
sisters made that an endowed chair. And that's

12:34.615 --> 12:36.878
when he wanted to make an endowed chair. 
professorship and not a chair. And I said, you

12:41.518 --> 12:42.839
can't do it. And he thought, gee, you know, nobody 
had ever told the dean he couldn't. But I knew I had

12:49.426 --> 12:51.648
to, so I did. What kind of activities went on at 
Guyon Hall? What did a student go to see at Guyon

12:56.093 --> 12:58.896
Hall? We had assemblies there, is all I can tell 
you. And it was on a flat floor. You couldn't see

13:04.862 --> 13:07.084
anything. Oh, every activity of any size was in 
there. They had the assembly hall, too, which was,

13:14.456 --> 13:18.943
what did we do in the assembly hall? Assembly hall 
was where they had picture shows, yeah.

13:24.711 --> 13:25.933
How often did you go to the movie? I never did go. I 
didn't have any money. What did you spend any money

13:30.960 --> 13:35.526
on? What did you spend for fun?

13:41.540 --> 13:43.222
But it didn't induce me, really. We were going to 
school and borrowed money, so I didn't spend a lot

13:45.844 --> 13:51.210
for anything. I'm trying to think. That's been so 
far back. I

13:54.994 --> 14:03.703
guess I got to go to a picture show now and then at the 
assembly hall. That was an interesting old wooden

14:05.625 --> 14:08.087
structure.

14:11.425 --> 14:15.791
They had all the class meetings there and class 
elections and those things. Now, it was west of

14:16.231 --> 14:17.854
Sabisa.

14:20.317 --> 14:20.797
Let me think. It was... Toward the railroad from 
Sabisa? Well, it was toward Guyon Hall. Oh. Okay.

14:29.909 --> 14:31.932
Over about where the chapel is now. Yeah, it was. 
The chapel backed up to it at one time, I believe.

14:36.919 --> 14:40.183
Here in the right... That may be where it was. the 
chapel may take its site. Because it wasn't Lowell

14:43.102 --> 14:46.727
Hall next to it. It was next to Lowell Hall. I 
remember there was a very narrow walk between

14:49.210 --> 14:54.678
Lowell Hall and the assembly hall. Who were some 
famous people that came to the campus while you

14:56.020 --> 15:00.526
were a student? Describe that, please. Well, we 
had a We had everybody lined completely around

15:08.125 --> 15:14.473
Kyle Field. And he rode by in

15:15.194 --> 15:32.937
the car of the limousine

15:15.194 --> 15:32.937
with the Secret Service man with him. And then they 
had lunch on the farm or something. Then we had a

15:37.218 --> 15:43.287
parade, a review fire on Drillfield. But that's 
the biggest man I guess we had come. And then I think

15:46.933 --> 15:48.495
Elder came later. When he came, were you aware of 
his physical disabilities? Oh, yeah. We saw him in

15:55.358 --> 15:58.723
Africa with us during the war. Oh, I know you did 
during the war. But someone told me that when he

16:01.847 --> 16:16.449
came to visit A&M that time, there were no 
photographers allowed to take a picture of his...

16:01.847 --> 16:16.449
Well, I know he had his wheelchair. Yeah, I guess it 
was a wheelchair. Come to think of it, I don't know.

16:21.076 --> 16:23.259
They didn't take any pictures. Anyway... All 
right, Mrs. Roosevelt came. Do you remember any

16:26.801 --> 16:29.124
other famous celebrities?

16:32.108 --> 16:33.169
I don't remember. Entertainers? Big bands? Well, 
we had the big bands. We had Glenn Gray. We had Duke

16:42.061 --> 16:43.103
Ellington.

16:46.888 --> 16:47.709
Those I remember. And... This is a big band era. 
They had those down for the military balls and for

16:52.421 --> 16:59.531
the junior, senior prom. We had the big name bands. 
Did you go to those dances? I worked a deal.

17:11.927 --> 17:18.336
The social secretary, they wanted some plants 
around the bandstand. And they had to get

17:19.548 --> 17:24.033
permission from Mr. Hensel each time they had one. 
So I made a deal that if they gave me a package of

17:24.053 --> 17:31.022
dances, I'd get the permits every week. So I'd see 
Mr. Hensel the whole time, and I'd get the thing

17:32.283 --> 17:36.929
filled out for him. And so they gave me a package. I 
got to give all the dances free.

17:46.902 --> 17:50.466
How did Aggies behave at those dances? What were 
they like? Very well behaved. Very well behaved.

17:58.456 --> 18:03.643
There might have been one or two out of line, but 
they didn't stay out of line. Aggies, this was

18:03.663 --> 18:05.065
them. But when we had the infantry ball, For 
instance, you were supposed to dance with

18:11.827 --> 18:16.772
everybody from your company that day at one time. 
So they got in a rush. And you were sometimes just a

18:19.375 --> 18:22.679
continual tag.

18:26.803 --> 18:27.864
But you didn't have to do it. I don't believe I saw 
very much misbehavior anywhere unless it was

18:28.625 --> 18:36.254
after the dance was over and those things. And I 
didn't see that. We moved out of the dormitories.

18:41.223 --> 18:48.872
And girls would move in there for one dance, or 
whatever happened to be the occasion. See, in the

18:48.972 --> 18:56.981
infantry ball, they moved out to Hart Hall, and the 
girls stayed in Hart Hall. And I was lucky. One of my

19:01.225 --> 19:05.370
professors and his wife had a freedom of their own. 
So you tried to get a place for them to stay. But if

19:10.096 --> 19:11.578
you could, you'd put it in a dormitory.

19:14.501 --> 19:24.271
The

19:14.501 --> 19:24.271
big dances and everything, young ladies came down 
on the train or on the buses? Well, sometimes they

19:25.352 --> 19:32.720
came on buses from the CIA, Texas State College for 
Women. Sometimes they'd come on the train. There

19:36.320 --> 19:40.184
wasn't much motor transportation then. We had 
cars. We didn't have too many cars. I remember my

19:44.628 --> 19:54.978
senior year, we had one car that old boy borrowed, 
brought home, brought down for home, and somebody

19:44.628 --> 19:54.978
wrecked it. Bill Turner. Now, did you ever have any 
special dates during that era? Did you and Freda

20:01.564 --> 20:03.246
know each other then? Oh, we grew up together in the 
same town. Okay. We knew all the in-laws and

20:06.003 --> 20:09.187
out-laws on both sides. Did you bring her down for 
some of those dances? She came down for them, but I

20:13.193 --> 20:16.358
guess we came on the train. All the way from 
Franklin to College Station on the train? No, she

20:21.685 --> 20:22.967
was in Baylor, in Waco. Oh, wow. And, you know, I 
don't remember how we got there. I don't know. We

20:29.776 --> 20:31.238
didn't have a car or anything. They didn't have a 
car. But anyway, we got there. And we had good

20:37.475 --> 20:38.976
dances there. Friedrich remembers a lot about the 
dances too. All right. The religious activities

20:47.023 --> 20:54.990
around the campus, did you and your buddies go to 
church ever? Yeah, we had a church. We had a church,

20:56.211 --> 20:58.793
a Baptist church at the North Gate. And we'd go up 
there. I used to know the preacher's name. I've

21:03.717 --> 21:04.758
forgotten it now. But we went to church regularly. 
As regularly as you can, I guess. Was there a

21:11.057 --> 21:13.379
religious emphasis week then? No. That wasn't? I 
can't tell you. I don't remember.

21:19.766 --> 21:20.807
What about athletics? Describe a Saturday home 
football day. What did that day include? When did

21:27.715 --> 21:28.656
it begin? It began at Reveille. I went to bed at 
Taps. But I remember... We had not beaten TCU in 10

21:36.858 --> 21:45.235
years, and we beat them in 37, I think it was. And 
somebody made a grave on the end of the, you know

21:46.378 --> 21:54.715
where the bugle stand used to be? Bell and Jimmy, 
all right. Somebody made a grave there and put it

21:58.355 --> 22:00.497
through the boom. It says, here lies a TCU jinx. 
Dead no longer stinks. And later in Oklahoma, I had

22:05.921 --> 22:10.045
a flower shop. And we meet somebody, Texas, I 
guess. And I put a little grave in the window. A

22:17.111 --> 22:18.752
little boy came in and offered me $100. I said, you 
can have it.

22:23.577 --> 22:24.077
But I remember that Homer Arden, that week, had a 
big stand built. And he'd say, hit him again. He

22:32.364 --> 22:34.065
kept laying flat on his back. And that was Sammy 
Ball. And they'd have him laying flat on his back

22:35.887 --> 22:38.249
all afternoon. And they beat TCU for the first time 
in 10 years. All right. Now, those football days,

22:42.373 --> 22:45.376
you'd get up early in the morning. And what'd you 
all do on the Saturday morning of a home game

22:45.396 --> 22:52.022
other than go to class?

22:54.685 --> 22:57.228
Well, we had Saturday classes in between. I guess 
we got out of Franklin to Haskell. I don't remember

23:02.456 --> 23:06.481
what we did. Was there a pass-by in those days? Did 
you march in for review at the game? No.

23:16.515 --> 23:16.575
No. No, the core was a later thing. But I remember 
that. All right, and you stood at the game with your

23:27.602 --> 23:31.007
date. You stood at the game with your date. And we 
were never allowed to sit down any time. And if you

23:39.899 --> 23:45.527
won the game, whose job was it to go get the yell 
leaders? That came later, too. Oh, really? Oh, so.

23:50.821 --> 23:54.626
Well, we didn't have a fish pond until the class of 
38. Now, let me think. I guess they went after them,

23:59.594 --> 24:06.144
but I don't know who went after them or what they did 
with them. You see, the class of 38 gave that

24:06.865 --> 24:15.638
fountain, and it's been repaired and worked over 
so many times. And I know when we had our

24:16.529 --> 24:30.184
one reunion, I asked them if they would repair it 
and have it running for that occasion. They said,

24:30.885 --> 24:35.250
yeah, we've already spent so much money on that 
thing that we don't want to spend any more. Who

24:36.431 --> 24:39.675
suggested that the class of 38 give the fish pond? 
Do you know? I don't know who suggested it. I guess

24:44.300 --> 24:46.502
John Bone. And John

24:47.022 --> 24:55.792
Bowman was like his president, I'm sure. I know he 
did, because he told me one time he had a whole

24:56.853 --> 25:04.622
series of letters from Mr. Enzo back and forth 
between the two. And I said, well, if you give me

25:05.623 --> 25:12.290
those letters, I'd like to have them and put them in 
the archive. But he never got around to give them to

25:12.310 --> 25:13.992
me. So anyway, I know that John was in on it, of 
course, as president. And there was someone else

25:21.397 --> 25:31.669
that keeps reminding us that everybody, somebody 
owed so much money on that pond, yeah. And I forgot

25:33.451 --> 25:34.533
who it was. It was somebody from West Texas, from 
Midland. I can't prove his name out right now.

25:40.634 --> 25:46.841
After a home victory, where did Aggies go to 
celebrate on Saturday night?

25:50.345 --> 25:52.007
What's that bridge down that road? Uncle Ed's? 
Uncle Ed's. Oh, you can find him there all the time.

25:58.174 --> 25:59.436
And how was that name? Was it H-Y-R-D?

26:04.341 --> 26:05.122
Maybe Hard Liquor. Well, I know it was Hard Liquor, 
but was it a Czech name? Yeah. Because I've tried to

26:11.093 --> 26:16.738
find out H-Y-R-D-L-Y-C-K-A or whatever it was. I 
don't think you're close on that one. Okay. I

26:22.083 --> 26:25.706
don't know. That should be somewhere. It should be 
in this row somewhere. Because everybody went

26:29.970 --> 26:32.492
there. Describe the place. How big was it? I didn't 
go. Oh, you didn't go? I didn't drink beer. I didn't

26:37.537 --> 26:41.100
go.

26:42.532 --> 26:43.053
Let's see. Basketball. Describe DeWare 
Fieldhouse and what it was like to go to a game

26:44.915 --> 26:49.700
there. It was worse than the Holler House on the 
Browns I ever thought about, Mick. It was so small.

26:56.568 --> 26:59.751
And they only had seats on each side. It wasn't an 
oval. And very few people got to go because there

27:05.117 --> 27:11.104
just wasn't enough room.

27:11.590 --> 27:14.413
Describe the Aggie student body. What was a 
typical Aggie student in those days? Where were

27:16.995 --> 27:18.536
Aggies from? What were their attitudes?

27:24.742 --> 27:26.624
Were they city boys or country boys? I guess they 
were more from the city than they were from the

27:28.085 --> 27:32.028
country, I'd say. Maybe 60-40, maybe.

27:37.874 --> 27:41.597
They all came to A&M because of the leadership. 
built in, everybody

27:42.185 --> 27:51.015
came in because they wanted to. And they weren't 
pushed there at all. And

27:56.201 --> 28:06.893
some went because people in their hometown had 
gone there and different reasons like that. The

28:08.476 --> 28:13.662
current word is diversity. How diverse was the 
student body then? Not very diverse. Do you

28:20.670 --> 28:23.173
remember some Catholic boys? Jewish? Let me think 
of it.

28:32.464 --> 28:34.506
I know we had both of them. I had friends with both of 
them. but I can't remember the names right now.

28:38.675 --> 28:38.956
Let's see.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.772
I can't remember who they were. Were there some 
Hispanic? Very few, very few. Were there some that

29:00.021 --> 29:01.483
were rich?

29:05.260 --> 29:07.923
Well, I don't know whether they were or not. I 
worked all the time, so I didn't know. I do know that

29:11.767 --> 29:18.774
some of the boys on the corps staff

29:11.767 --> 29:18.774
didn't worry about money. They seemed to be all 
right. And I guess some of them had enough money

29:22.899 --> 29:29.726
they didn't have to worry about anything. But I 
never was familiar. I had one friend that was a

29:34.150 --> 29:46.665
freshman with me, and his

29:34.150 --> 29:46.665
stepdaddy was a banker, and he sent him out with a 
checkbook. And you know, that's when one semester

29:46.685 --> 29:49.408
flunked everything there was. And he went to 
Baylor and did the same thing. So he

29:53.953 --> 30:01.542
and his brother ended up in the Air Corps. They both 
came out of the war all right, but they didn't go

30:03.007 --> 30:06.512
back to school. You spent more money in one year 
than I spent the whole time, four or five years. Do

30:12.680 --> 30:17.606
you have any idea what a year cost at A&M in those 
days? I can tell you.

30:25.577 --> 30:31.545
My class president who just died at our last 
reunion told us that he spent $303.

30:35.428 --> 30:36.909
Total or total? First year. And he ended up as a 
banker. The big student organizations then, the

30:42.515 --> 30:50.783
core was the ultimate. What other organizations 
were there with high prestige? Well, we had the

30:55.027 --> 30:58.090
Ross Volunteers. I got a bid at Ross Vaughan, too, 
and I didn't have a hundred dollars to buy a uniform

30:58.913 --> 31:09.162
with. And I understand there were a couple or three 
secret fraternities on campus, but I don't know

31:09.262 --> 31:15.007
what they were. It was rumored. Do you know what 
their names were? I think True Texans was one.

31:22.694 --> 31:23.956
That's the one I can recall. All right, now I've 
heard of another one called the Stickers. Never

31:27.899 --> 31:28.920
heard of that one. uh... what was their purpose do 
you have any idea what was there reason for being

31:29.373 --> 31:59.363
like fraternity two or three people have offered 
this the gas that their primary reason was to try to

31:29.373 --> 31:59.363
get their members as core commanders uh... that to 
get their group in the key positions

31:29.373 --> 31:59.363
working on monday i i wouldn't want anything I 
worked an awful lot. Other than that, I was in class

32:02.075 --> 32:06.162
or at work nine hours a day. And that don't leave you 
a lot of time. I didn't get around a lot and make a lot

32:08.907 --> 32:11.732
of friends. My very best friend was killed at the 
beginning of our senior year in an airplane crash.

32:17.181 --> 32:18.644
David Murphy from Ohio. They were... chasing that 
Bloomingdale Railroad train. Uh-oh. And hit

32:29.525 --> 32:33.690
something down, there went two of them. Other 
organizations, how prestigious was the Aggie

32:33.710 --> 32:38.676
band then? Oh, it's always been one of the best 
things there. It's always been the hardest thing

32:43.702 --> 32:47.907
to get in, too. You had to be a good musician, 
always. It's gotten so big now that they have our

32:54.541 --> 32:58.546
specialties, all of them. What about Yale 
leaders? Was that important? Oh, yes. I remember

33:04.413 --> 33:07.096
they had the Yale leader elections every year. And 
I remember,

33:07.997 --> 33:13.884
I'm trying to think of his name now.

33:17.688 --> 33:19.931
But they had the Yale leader election every year. 
We had Yale practice in front of Hawaii. for a long

33:23.583 --> 33:27.147
time, then it went over to Henderson Hall. Didn't 
last long before Henderson Hall, though. That was

33:30.471 --> 33:34.055
popular because of so much mud, it rained. But, 
uh... And, uh, was, uh... I'm trying to think of

33:39.821 --> 33:41.463
somebody's name. You remember the basketball 
player named, uh...

33:48.952 --> 33:50.113
They were four brothers.

33:53.401 --> 33:55.244
Well, we'll get it later. And was it important to be 
the senior class president?

34:03.135 --> 34:04.197
Well, I guess it was. Because you all didn't have a 
student body president then, I don't think.

34:09.564 --> 34:11.968
Senior class president was Tom Murrow. He died a 
couple weeks ago. And he was also a freshman class

34:16.414 --> 34:19.679
president. No, he was freshman class president. 
and captain of the band. And John Bone was senior

34:24.896 --> 34:29.662
class president. And John Bone went to work for the 
IBM. And he met a lady, a girl from Norman,

34:36.852 --> 34:43.782
Oklahoma, who I know real well. I've kept up with 
her all the years. And then about three years ago,

34:48.008 --> 35:05.090
they had a tree day in Oklahoma, and invited me to 
come up as a special guest for planting trees,

34:48.008 --> 35:05.090
because I had planted over two hundred trees on 
that campus. And then I had also planted a hundred

35:06.171 --> 35:17.526
and eight million through garden clubs on the 
project one year. The president, who was a former

35:18.957 --> 35:33.218
senator, Boren, asked me to come up there, and they 
had a big program about the trees. In the middle

35:34.300 --> 35:42.331
30s, the water table dropped to 108 feet, and all 
the big trees on campus died. So we replaced them,

35:43.453 --> 35:47.479
and I had the chance to choose a tree of choice to 
replace them with, which was a red oak. And they're

35:53.196 --> 35:56.301
now beautiful, beautiful fall colors. And last 
time I was on that campus, I got to see those things

35:57.162 --> 36:02.190
in color. Now that causes me to ask you to describe 
the planting of all of those live oak trees on the

36:04.874 --> 36:15.471
A&M campus. It's a good story. a professor of 
botany wanted to put American, uh, palms. And he

36:25.716 --> 36:29.161
and Mr. Hensel had a debate. Mr. Hensel once said, 
we'd be glad if it was to be the tree. But when I went

36:33.766 --> 36:39.654
there in 34, they said put palms all the way down 
Ross Avenue. When I went there in 34, there was four

36:44.311 --> 36:45.793
left with the palms. And in the last junior year, 
those froze. They had no more palms on campus.

36:54.742 --> 36:58.826
That's why we have the live oaks, the stenciled 
children. When did the live oaks, when were they

36:58.846 --> 37:03.071
first put out going east? All right, that's a good 
question. Very few people know that story. It's

37:08.777 --> 37:13.862
the only time that I was ever aware that they had an 
appropriation of money to buy trees. But they put

37:14.483 --> 37:17.907
out trees less than two inches in diameter. They 
cost $1.75 a piece. And they came from Griffin's

37:22.612 --> 37:24.614
Nursery in Beaumont. And of course they've done 
very well. But... Do you remember how many there

37:30.721 --> 37:37.088
were in the purchase?

37:37.108 --> 37:38.749
No, I don't. I do know that that's what they told us. 
But now later, when I was first there, we'd

37:44.369 --> 37:46.211
establish the perimeter trees. And I bought those 
from a nursery in

37:47.293 --> 37:56.023
Kingsville, yeah, down in the valley.

38:00.428 --> 38:09.459
We could take those trees, they were two-inch 
trees, row-run, set them down in a row, take them as

38:00.428 --> 38:09.459
they come, for $200 apiece. So they increased the 
load. But we did the perimeter of the campus then.

38:17.851 --> 38:27.285
And we put them 80 feet apart so they could grow, 
make a statement, and put them 80 feet back from the

38:17.851 --> 38:27.285
curb so they wouldn't have to cut them down, ever. 
Which was later proved, because later they

38:28.227 --> 38:32.093
widened in Texas. And thank goodness we didn't 
lose the trees. But we lost one big tree in that

38:35.518 --> 38:39.064
expansion. It was on the golf course, hanging over 
the curb. But nobody could see that tree anyway. It

38:45.742 --> 38:46.463
was out in the street.

38:50.169 --> 38:54.075
Did you, as a student, help set out those first live 
oaks? No. But that's the only time we ever had

38:55.657 --> 38:57.380
money. We collected acres every year and planted 
them in the greenhouse. put them in a four-inch pot

39:03.884 --> 39:17.901
until they got about a foot or two tall, then took 
them out on what is now Canyon Hill, way out there

39:03.884 --> 39:17.901
across Bethel, and grew them in a nursery, and then 
brought them back to the campus. Now, I do know that

39:18.742 --> 39:30.937
when they had the big ice storm in 1936 or 1937,

39:18.742 --> 39:30.937
some of those trees were two inches in diameter by 
then. Between the Ag Building and the library, and

39:34.327 --> 39:36.870
they got isolated and snapped in two. We hauled 
brush off that campus for weeks and a lot of the big

39:37.971 --> 39:50.947
limbs came down too because they were isolated and 
got overweight.

39:50.967 --> 40:00.418
Blessed with the gift of hindsight, were we well 
advised to concentrate on live oaks or would have

39:50.967 --> 40:00.418
been better to have had a variety of trees? Well, I 
think that a variety would have been better. But I

40:09.176 --> 40:11.960
think that the live oaks established the pattern. 
And I think that a tree, a prominent tree of live

40:12.721 --> 40:17.187
oaks was all right. A few others mixed in at the time 
would have been all right, I think. But hindsight,

40:22.535 --> 40:28.583
as you say, is better than foresight. I've often 
wondered that oak that the students now call the

40:29.356 --> 40:34.063
Century Oak. The photographs that I have seen of 
the original Old Main building cause me to think

40:35.685 --> 40:47.222
that tree is not quite as old as the students think 
it is. I don't think so. It's just called the

40:48.424 --> 40:53.492
Century Oak because it's the biggest oak we have 
and it's one you can climb in. A very historical

40:53.512 --> 40:56.576
oak. Now, you remember some Senior class gathered 
acorns and planted them and sold seedlings from

40:59.225 --> 41:06.037
the century oak. I don't remember what class it 
was, but they did that to raise money for their

41:06.057 --> 41:10.404
class gift. Let's see. Project houses. Oh, yeah. 
Please describe them and the students who lived

41:17.917 --> 41:20.902
over there. All right.

41:27.659 --> 41:28.560
a doctor's name. Dan Russell. Dan Russell got the 
idea that they could come down there and bring

41:29.481 --> 41:39.669
groceries and food and cows, milk cows. And the 
first one was in Brown. And it went over so good, the

41:43.292 --> 41:46.976
university built those 12 down there. And they 
worked hard. They came out all right. Many of them,

41:52.701 --> 41:56.704
oh boy, got to go to school through the project 
houses. And when I went back to A&M,

41:57.646 --> 42:06.897
Morris Bloodworth was a Project House boy. And he 
was head of soil and crop sciences. And

42:11.562 --> 42:17.929
they'd have a Project House reunion every year. 
But that worked very well. And Dr. Russell should

42:20.552 --> 42:27.180
have been given a lot more recognition for it, I 
think, than he got. Were they built while you were a

42:27.430 --> 42:29.792
student? Yes. Some of them were already there? The 
first one, some were in Bryan. But they built those

42:38.619 --> 42:41.242
while I was there. And I'm trying to think of a... 
I'm not sure they were either. There was another

42:48.207 --> 42:57.235
one out on the Horticulture Farm that they made a 
project house for people from over around

42:48.207 --> 42:57.235
Crockett

43:06.462 --> 43:09.865
I don't really know now. Let me see. Now, I do know 
this. After we made the test gardens at A&M, Dr.

43:13.548 --> 43:19.253
Russell would come over and walk through those. He 
got more kick and benefit from a test garden than I

43:19.954 --> 43:24.798
believe anybody else. He would come over and spend 
hours studying the flowers. They were all set up

43:29.622 --> 43:32.344
and labeled, you know. And he, I'd see him over 
there lots of times. after he retired, walking

43:36.415 --> 43:39.839
through, spending time with him. And that did me a 
lot of good to see him, enjoy him. He seemed always

43:47.167 --> 43:50.531
to be deeply concerned about students. Yes, he was 
very. He was very concerned about students and

43:53.254 --> 43:59.520
their well-being and how they were getting along.

44:02.584 --> 44:03.705
Let's see.

44:06.250 --> 44:08.713
Your senior boots, do you remember when you bought 
them? Oh, yeah. Describe, please. I bought them

44:11.636 --> 44:19.684
from Lou Casey in San Antonio and paid $35 a pair for 
them. And I bought them. They made them in the

44:24.109 --> 44:25.651
summer. They were all handmade back in those days, 
special for you, custom made for everybody. And I

44:31.677 --> 44:35.481
understand now those boots cost $600 to $700 a 
pair. $35 for boots, $25 for a senior ring. And the

44:43.091 --> 44:52.324
boots, they said I had the biggest pair of calves of 
a person they'd ever seen. And those were the

44:52.965 --> 44:54.708
biggest boots they'd ever made. And

44:55.729 --> 45:02.218
I just bought one of everything in the uniform. 
That's all I could afford. And I told you about

45:04.161 --> 45:06.244
Steve Sikash earlier. the federal transit bureau 
boy. He was the only one of those boys I know that

45:11.224 --> 45:15.389
finished a program. He finished landscape 
architecture. And when I graduated, I gave him my

45:18.272 --> 45:24.319
boots and everything. And see, I'd worn the soul 
draw three times my senior year. I had one pair of

45:31.988 --> 45:36.012
pink trousers and then boots. And anyway,

45:37.004 --> 45:47.436
those boots were made for me the summer of 37 in San 
Antonio.

45:53.963 --> 45:57.227
But I can't believe we paid $39 for them, but we did. 
Did you hitchhike over there to get them?

46:06.907 --> 46:12.214
They finished it up up there. Oh, so you could buy 
either from Hollick's or Lucchese. Hollick's

46:18.944 --> 46:20.466
came in the picture much later. Lucchese was early 
in the scene. I don't remember Hollick's until

46:26.414 --> 46:31.140
after our senior year. Maybe after I got back 
there.

46:36.978 --> 46:44.969
In terms of your senior ring, do you have any senior 
ring stories of where you lost it or somebody

46:36.978 --> 46:44.969
spotted it? Please share any ring stories. Okay. 
During the war, I had to lead the regimental column

46:49.055 --> 46:57.387
from Oran across to Tunisia. And we went through 
the Atlas Mountains, and it was cold. And I woke up

47:02.615 --> 47:03.576
one morning.
