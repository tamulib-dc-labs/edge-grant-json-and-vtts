00:02.849 --> 00:17.955
That when you're talking about business schools, and particularly in this area, that the University of Texas, you have to recognize that they have been seen as a leading business program for well over 75 years.

00:18.863 --> 00:24.710
consistently ranked among the handful of the best public schools.

00:25.531 --> 00:34.202
And obviously they're also dealing with some of the same political slash funding issues that we are.

00:35.043 --> 00:39.488
So, you know, quite frankly, and obviously with my own personal

00:39.468 --> 00:44.313
familiarity with there and also knowing a number of the people over there.

00:44.553 --> 00:50.699
That's been a school where we thought we could benefit from observing what they've done.

00:50.779 --> 00:52.480
We have not hesitated to do that.

00:53.702 --> 00:59.827
We have tried to steal the good ideas and reject the ones that we didn't think were good ideas.

01:01.569 --> 01:05.813
But, you know, I think if you were to ask them

01:06.923 --> 01:09.565
who's on their horizon.

01:10.046 --> 01:21.396
Now they would grudgingly say, you know, those upstarts over A&M are getting a little more attention than we would like to see, and I think it's been a healthy thing.

01:21.416 --> 01:35.428
I think it's a great thing for the state of Texas to have two public business programs that are ranked in the top 15 or 20 of public programs in the nation.

01:36.117 --> 01:38.321
You're using a line I've used a good deal.

01:38.561 --> 01:45.012
I love to work into a speech to former students, particularly muster something, with a straight face.

01:45.112 --> 01:52.845
I say, one of the greatest blessings Texas A&M has is to have another first-rate public institution only 100 miles away.

01:54.107 --> 01:57.332
Eyes get big, and some of them frown, and I say, now, wait a minute, folks.

01:58.173 --> 02:03.340
don't you agree with me that everything those orange people do, A&M tries to outdo?

02:03.360 --> 02:04.182
And they go, yes.

02:04.462 --> 02:08.227
And I said, and don't you think everything we do, they try to exceed?

02:08.328 --> 02:08.848
They say, yes.

02:08.928 --> 02:11.572
And I said, as a result, we ratchet each other up.

02:12.193 --> 02:15.979
And I use as my general example national merit winners.

02:16.419 --> 02:20.485
That we were ahead of them in 79 when Peter Flan became president.

02:21.747 --> 02:23.329
And he said, that's unacceptable.

02:23.429 --> 02:24.450
We've got to beat the Aggies.

02:25.151 --> 02:29.197
They are ahead of us now, but each of us have more than twice as many as we had in 79.

02:30.018 --> 02:30.458
We're both.

02:30.799 --> 02:31.419
That's right.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.143
And then they'll say, yeah, yeah, that is good.

02:34.183 --> 02:34.824
That is good.

02:35.204 --> 02:47.400
And I ask them to compare, say, Louisiana, where there's only one public that anybody knows about, or Tennessee, or Kentucky, that to have two really helps.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.752
I think it's been very beneficial.

02:49.772 --> 02:57.913
And, you know, this, like all dimensions of the university, I think there's much more cooperation than most people realize.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.551
You know, we've got a good working relationship with them.

03:01.612 --> 03:03.555
We've put on some joint programs.

03:03.655 --> 03:13.314
We had a joint program out of the Washington campus, which we're both charter members of, that we work together on.

03:13.374 --> 03:19.266
And, you know, I pick up the phone on a not infrequent basis and just say, you know, what are you doing about this?

03:19.326 --> 03:20.408
And they do the same.

03:21.097 --> 03:26.585
You know, for example, Bill Cunningham, who was the chancellor there, is an old friend of mine.

03:26.605 --> 03:29.148
We were assistant professors of marketing together.

03:30.230 --> 03:32.413
His son came to school here.

03:32.914 --> 03:33.234
Yes.

03:33.474 --> 03:46.733
Just graduated in business, you know, and Bill was so impressed with the advice and the treatment that his son got after he'd been here a year or so.

03:47.152 --> 03:59.106
that we got a call from the business school undergraduate office at Austin and said, you know, we'd like to come and sit down with your folks for a day and let's exchange some ideas.

03:59.186 --> 04:01.609
He had told me, you know, you ought to get up there and see what they're doing.

04:01.649 --> 04:06.194
And so we've got a good relationship and I think a healthy respect.

04:06.334 --> 04:13.142
I mean, you know, they don't want to give us too much credit if they can help it, but I think there's a lot of respect there.

04:16.733 --> 04:37.040
generalize about A&M business students, their spirit, their humor, any jokes, any pranks, any serious tragic episodes?

04:38.222 --> 04:43.669
Well, I can't think of any particular kinds of

04:44.223 --> 04:44.945
stories.

04:44.985 --> 04:52.326
In general, I'd characterize our students as very good, as you'd expect, with this kind of university.

04:52.346 --> 04:54.211
I think that sort of goes without saying.

04:54.252 --> 04:58.283
The competitiveness of getting into business school, our students, certainly from their

04:58.685 --> 05:04.090
academic standpoint are a really unquestionable high quality.

05:05.371 --> 05:18.224
But I would say our students are relatively speaking more practical and more career focused than you might find at some comparable schools.

05:21.086 --> 05:25.030
You know, they want to get in,

05:25.010 --> 05:30.717
get what information that they can and then they want to get out and get on with it.

05:31.538 --> 05:39.508
And, you know, that's not atypical of business schools, but ours are probably a little more focused.

05:40.169 --> 05:44.014
They, you know, I think it really serves us well.

05:45.415 --> 05:53.245
We always feel like that if we can get a company to come in and start hiring our students, that we've got that company.

05:53.630 --> 05:54.852
Can you give some examples?

05:55.012 --> 05:55.193
Sure.

05:55.313 --> 05:59.520
Koch Industries are recent, relatively recent, several years ago.

05:59.580 --> 06:01.604
This is out of Wichita.

06:01.624 --> 06:01.824
Wichita.

06:01.844 --> 06:02.045
K-O-C-H.

06:02.085 --> 06:02.305
Yeah.

06:03.327 --> 06:13.484
They came in and they had hired engineers here but had not hired business people and thought and said, well, you know, we'd like to hire some of your business folks.

06:13.565 --> 06:17.832
And they even took, brought a plane down, took some of our faculty up to, you know, really

06:18.166 --> 06:30.646
did it right and did some major interviewing and made some really competitive offers and hired some of our people and now they can't hire enough of them.

06:30.987 --> 06:45.270
Ford Motor Company did a very similar thing more recently, came down and hired some of our students and now we're one of their targeted handful of schools.

06:45.250 --> 06:48.034
The accounting firms discovered that long ago.

06:49.396 --> 07:02.597
With all five of the accounting firms, I believe this is accurate, we're one of their top three or four source schools for new employees.

07:02.697 --> 07:11.190
So our students, one, I think we are giving them a good education, but I think we're starting with a very good product.

07:11.727 --> 07:19.438
These are young people that are very focused and willing to work hard and want to be successful.

07:20.740 --> 07:30.494
And in the normal definition of the words conservative and liberal, our students are a little... Oh, very conservative.

07:30.514 --> 07:31.375
Very conservative.

07:31.395 --> 07:32.016
Very conservative.

07:32.036 --> 07:41.430
As a university, I mean, certainly compared to if you were to take other top 50 kinds of schools, I would think that we would fall

07:41.410 --> 07:47.755
well toward the most conservative category.

07:48.316 --> 07:55.982
Now, in the business world, in placement of students, is that an advantage or a disadvantage or just a reality?

07:56.443 --> 07:57.864
I think it's just a reality.

07:58.304 --> 08:10.995
You know, to the extent that that reflects other values, it may be an advantage if it reflects kind of an orientation toward success and to

08:10.975 --> 08:17.886
to work hard to achieve that success, then it's a very positive attribute.

08:17.946 --> 08:27.701
Those don't always go hand in hand, but to the extent that it does reflect some of those career focus kinds of attitudes, it's probably helpful.

08:27.721 --> 08:32.669
And most of our students, I presume, are now urban.

08:34.853 --> 08:37.557
I would say that's certainly true of the business

08:38.009 --> 08:52.435
I mean, we still, you know, we get a lot of people from non-urban settings, but if you use the word most, then I would say most are Houston, Dallas, San Antonio.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.461
Are there many international students in business?

08:55.897 --> 08:57.442
Undergraduates?

08:57.462 --> 08:58.625
Undergraduate, no.

08:59.408 --> 09:09.940
We could have as many international students at the graduate level as we want, but at the undergraduate level, I would say compared probably to most other ranked programs,

09:10.426 --> 09:15.514
And our undergraduate program, as you know, is ranked in the top 25, according to U.S.

09:15.594 --> 09:19.260
News, our MBA in the top 50, but our undergraduate.

09:19.461 --> 09:24.689
But we're probably at the low end of the scale in terms of percentage of international students.

09:25.751 --> 09:36.889
You know, part of that is this kind of a reality of the university setting we're in and the fact that in a non-urban setting that we probably attract fewer international students.

09:36.869 --> 09:42.680
But it's like, oh, nine or eight, nine percent.

09:44.344 --> 09:55.004
Do you have any memories about an A&M student in business, an example of determination, willpower, perseverance?

09:55.645 --> 09:59.012
You know, I think there are a lot of those.

10:00.359 --> 10:09.435
You know, one that's doing very well, we were just talking about recently, been in New York City for 10 years, is now managing director for a major investment banking firm.

10:11.118 --> 10:16.647
Craig McMahon, who was an undergraduate student here.

10:16.627 --> 10:30.737
was an okay student, but he certainly wasn't an award winner, a good, solid young man, but he was really, from day one, the first time I met him and talked to him,

10:31.223 --> 10:44.911
You know, wanted to go to New York City and take a shot at it and worked hard at getting interviews, did some internships, went up there and it's just been tremendously successful.

10:45.552 --> 10:52.506
And I'm sure that he's put in enormous hours every week and worked hard, but he's

10:52.486 --> 10:55.550
obviously reaping a lot of rewards for it.

10:56.751 --> 11:10.127
We've had other students that have quickly made their mark with some of the accounting firms and any number of examples.

11:11.569 --> 11:20.620
Do you recall any examples of undergraduate attempts to trick a faculty member or play a joke on a faculty member?

11:21.967 --> 11:32.659
There are probably a lot of those, but most people assume that deans don't have a sense of humor, so we're not often directly involved in that.

11:32.679 --> 11:38.986
But I'm sure that there have been a number of them, but none that come to mind.

11:40.047 --> 11:47.535
One of my favorites from my teaching days here, I always stressed on the first day of class,

11:48.207 --> 11:49.149
Here's the schedule.

11:49.169 --> 11:50.231
Here are the lecture topics.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.032
Here are the assignments.

11:51.052 --> 11:52.134
Here's when the tests are.

11:52.234 --> 11:53.276
Here's when the final is.

11:53.577 --> 11:53.877
That's it.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.821
Now, we don't move those around.

11:55.901 --> 11:57.884
We don't vote on them and so forth.

11:57.904 --> 12:09.665
So if you're planning on being sick then, and this youngster, a core freshman, came up very, very seriously to tell me that his grandpa was sick, and I expressed my sadness, and I said, I hope not.

12:09.685 --> 12:10.968
Oh, yeah, it's very, very serious.

12:11.549 --> 12:12.831
Well, I hope he'll...

12:12.811 --> 12:15.074
And he said, no, it's probably going to be terminal.

12:15.094 --> 12:17.116
And I said, gee, you know, we'll do the best we can.

12:17.157 --> 12:23.505
As he walked to the door, he looked over his shoulder and he said, in fact, it's almost certain he's going to die the first day of deer season.

12:25.167 --> 12:27.650
So I thought, okay.

12:27.670 --> 12:30.654
You have to respect that kind of humor.

12:30.674 --> 12:35.300
The real Texas world.

12:36.361 --> 12:41.147
Your staff, the dean's staff, who were some of the...

12:41.127 --> 12:48.899
the long-serving members of that staff in the office that deserve pat on the back and praise?

12:49.019 --> 12:53.847
Well, you know, certainly my administrative assistant, Kimberly Potberg.

12:54.889 --> 12:56.090
Spell her last name.

12:56.771 --> 12:59.035
P-O-T-T-B-E-R-G.

12:59.015 --> 13:20.241
She's been with me eight or nine years, and is this great in kind of keeping things going and making sure that I know where I'm supposed to be, where I am, and also in dealing with special events in the external community.

13:20.341 --> 13:25.748
Our Outstanding Alumni Dinner each year, which is a big event, she takes care of that.

13:26.150 --> 13:30.397
I have a great relationship with my development council.

13:30.417 --> 13:40.916
I mean, I've really become close friends with a lot of them, but if they had to vote on whether Kimberly or I would depart, she would definitely win.

13:40.936 --> 13:43.500
I mean, they think she's just wonderful.

13:43.480 --> 13:49.747
If they need something or need to get in touch with me, well, you know, she's a great person to call.

13:49.807 --> 13:52.370
So she's just been... Where'd you locate her?

13:54.653 --> 13:59.498
It was a vacancy, and she was working here in the community.

13:59.538 --> 14:05.665
Her family's from this area, and both her mother and her sister-in-law work at the university.

14:05.726 --> 14:11.412
And it was just a happy circumstance for...

14:11.392 --> 14:13.354
happenstance for me.

14:13.374 --> 14:27.066
Our assistant dean, Valpera, that's been main assistant dean, Diane Conway, has been terrific.

14:27.086 --> 14:29.468
Her husband's on the faculty in chemistry.

14:29.948 --> 14:41.398
You know, these are people that make it fun to come to work because you know that they're going to do everything they can to make this college and consequently you look as good as possible.

14:41.378 --> 14:44.602
There have been any number of people I've worked with.

14:44.743 --> 14:59.142
You know, we've... I like to think that I've done a good job of getting the right people interested in doing the jobs, but I've also been very, very fortunate to have the quality of people available.

15:00.564 --> 15:10.457
You know, if you just look at the people that have been assistant deans and associate deans, you know, Gary Trenipole and Malcolm Richards and

15:11.028 --> 15:21.583
Don Hellriegel, and now Ricky Griffin, and John Dinkel, who was an associate provost for years, is back over as an associate dean in our college.

15:22.504 --> 15:31.737
And, you know, Bill Furst, who just left to become the dean at the University of Kansas, you know, really had some enormously talented people to work with.

15:33.893 --> 15:44.029
Describe working with the different provosts and presidents that you have in these 13 years.

15:45.371 --> 15:49.498
Well, you know, that's an interesting question.

15:49.518 --> 15:55.547
As we all know, that's certainly one of the challenges of any job.

15:59.476 --> 16:04.303
In many ways, our college is more self-sufficient than most.

16:05.725 --> 16:17.941
And as a consequence, some of the intersections of activity don't happen as much as they do with some colleges.

16:18.001 --> 16:21.366
That if we want to put on a program rather than go try to

16:21.835 --> 16:29.405
that the always iffy possibility of getting it from the provost, we'll try to get it from an external source and so forth.

16:29.445 --> 16:42.882
So in some ways we have less relationship than some colleges, but the issues that we deal with tend to be big ones like major resources, facilities, and things of that nature.

16:42.862 --> 16:49.751
We've had very, very different people to work with in the 13 years that I've been here.

16:50.532 --> 17:00.325
As I mentioned, Frank Vandiver probably knew, he didn't have a clue what business education was all about, but was always a delight to work with.

17:00.446 --> 17:03.770
And, you know, I personally like him a lot.

17:04.371 --> 17:08.937
And he was always supportive of us.

17:09.507 --> 17:15.117
you know, I think went out of his way to express that support.

17:15.558 --> 17:27.880
And, you know, Bill Mobley obviously knew a lot about business and certainly was philosophically in tune with what we were trying to do.

17:27.900 --> 17:32.528
I think I would have preferred he hadn't have bent over backwards so much to be fair.

17:32.508 --> 17:34.190
We don't want fairness.

17:37.295 --> 17:39.137
We want resources.

17:39.237 --> 17:43.323
But he was, you know, and he brought a lot of vision to the job.

17:43.744 --> 17:50.834
And, you know, I think it's been a tougher sell more recently for us.

17:50.874 --> 17:54.218
There are certainly other priorities, and that's to be recognized.

17:54.299 --> 17:59.646
But I think we have not done as good a job

17:59.845 --> 18:10.985
of somehow communicating the value of business to the university as perhaps we did with the prior administrations.

18:11.927 --> 18:14.952
All right, then the provost.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.196
The provost.

18:18.543 --> 18:24.971
You know, having been in that job, I fully appreciate what a difficult job it is.

18:25.031 --> 18:35.283
And I think the thing that I would say that I always ask of a provost is, just give us a hearing and give us an opportunity before the decision is made to make our case.

18:35.363 --> 18:39.528
And then if you don't agree with us, fine, we'll keep trying.

18:40.590 --> 18:44.955
You know, I think Donald MacDonald had a very

18:45.374 --> 18:59.063
reticent kind of personality, and he was a very quiet person, and some would describe him as not forceful, but our relationship was fine with Donald.

18:59.103 --> 19:03.332
He was a very quiet person and very deliberate.

19:03.498 --> 19:05.901
But, you know, I think he listened.

19:06.101 --> 19:15.992
Dean Gage, I thought, was just excellent in terms of his communication skills and, you know, really trying to give a forum.

19:17.954 --> 19:32.070
You know, I think that Douglas, Dr. Douglas, brings really a less participative

19:32.557 --> 19:34.079
kind of management style.

19:34.159 --> 19:38.905
I think that's changed some over time, but it's required some adjustment on our part.

19:39.326 --> 19:51.761
And we feel like that we probably haven't done as good a job as we would like to have done in terms of communicating some of our goals and aspirations.

19:52.663 --> 20:02.395
If you wanted an ally in these years from one of the other deans, who would have been your favorite allies?

20:03.860 --> 20:12.098
Well, I feel like we've had some good allies, and I've really always taken a lot of pleasure in the relationship that

20:12.517 --> 20:14.560
that I have with the other deans.

20:14.600 --> 20:27.021
You know, I went over and for a year was the interim provost, and really it was at the urging of the deans that I took on that job, even though I really didn't want to do it, but did.

20:27.822 --> 20:38.119
I think there are a lot that have been certainly good allies, and I'm probably not doing justice to some of the people that were here.

20:38.639 --> 20:44.410
when I first came because they're not as recent in memory.

20:44.430 --> 20:53.328
But, you know, certainly at the time he was Dean of Engineering, Herb Richardson, you know, at the time we were trying to get our building and so forth.

20:53.909 --> 20:58.318
You know, he certainly had contact with the regents and so forth.

20:58.940 --> 21:06.876
It would have been easy for him not to have been helpful, and I think he certainly was very helpful.

21:06.916 --> 21:12.848
But I really enjoyed working with a lot of the deans.

21:13.351 --> 21:18.978
Shattuck over in Vet Medicine, I think, was a delightful person.

21:19.038 --> 21:27.368
But yeah, you know, I would be hard pressed if you were to say, well, here are some deans that you just really didn't want to have much to do with.

21:27.388 --> 21:39.302
Any that have been in their job for an extended period of time that I've really gotten to know, I've really felt really very good about working with them and have enjoyed the relationship.

21:39.903 --> 21:42.666
Right now, long ago, in the 70s,

21:42.646 --> 21:53.457
and earlier there was an old saying that if either the dean of agriculture or engineering doesn't want something to happen, it won't happen.

21:55.099 --> 22:02.387
There is no dean or para-deans today that could veto a project, is there?

22:02.827 --> 22:06.050
No, I certainly, I don't think that's the case.

22:07.472 --> 22:09.514
You know, I think that

22:09.815 --> 22:15.120
as the other programs have grown in stature that that becomes less easy to do.

22:15.921 --> 22:37.560
Now, I will tell you that I think one of the disadvantages that most deans have on this campus and one that I think that has troubled me and that as I leave this job in a year that I think will trouble my successor is the fact that those two deans

22:38.063 --> 22:45.635
by nature of their dual appointment, still have an audience at every regents meeting that we do not have.

22:46.056 --> 22:56.713
And my year as provost was very revealing from that regard in that, in effect, as the agency heads, they make a report.

22:56.693 --> 23:03.644
at every regents meeting, it was my observation that much of that report talked about their college and not about their agency.

23:04.385 --> 23:08.511
And that's an audience that the other colleges do not have.

23:08.732 --> 23:13.499
And there is no question that that's an advantage.

23:13.519 --> 23:21.351
When I was dean of faculties under Jack Williams, and he was president of the system and of the institution,

23:22.512 --> 23:28.123
that problem didn't exist, and I saw the advantages of that very clearly.

23:28.885 --> 23:32.852
And you went to him with whatever issue, and you got an answer.

23:33.213 --> 23:34.796
It was decided, yay or nay.

23:35.578 --> 23:40.808
And one of the things that he was hoping to do would be to make available

23:41.345 --> 23:50.907
the possibility to all faculty, regardless of what college they were in, to get funding from the experiment stations from either one.

23:51.408 --> 24:00.889
If you're doing a business research project that relates to engineering or to agriculture, submit it, it'll be reviewed and it might work.

24:00.869 --> 24:14.484
And I certainly am on the side of what... Yeah, I mean, I would be delighted if it ever reaches me, I could get up and give them about five minutes of the exciting things happening in business.

24:15.866 --> 24:16.447
I agree with you.

24:17.868 --> 24:18.289
Let's see.

24:19.850 --> 24:25.697
Make believe that you're an advisor to the new dean here.

24:26.538 --> 24:28.480
What advice would you give him or her?

24:31.413 --> 24:48.477
Well, you know, basically I think anybody, I would certainly hope that this is going to be an attractive enough position that anybody we get is going to be a pretty experienced administrator.

24:49.081 --> 25:03.579
You know, probably some of the fundamental kinds of advice you really don't need to give, but I would say recognize and appreciate the value of the unique character of this institution.

25:04.400 --> 25:15.033
There are some things about it that are harder to embrace than others, but in some, it's a very unique thing.

25:15.093 --> 25:17.316
I mean, things like Fish Camp,

25:18.005 --> 25:23.974
that students come back from that already feel like they're part of the institution.

25:23.994 --> 25:25.196
This color in their blood.

25:25.396 --> 25:26.017
That's right.

25:26.057 --> 25:29.743
I mean, you cannot duplicate that.

25:30.203 --> 25:32.126
You know, somehow it's this there.

25:33.108 --> 25:47.269
And the quality of students that we're able to attract, the loyalty of the former students that sometimes will offer advice on how to run the place, and fine, sometimes they have good ideas,

25:47.688 --> 26:01.748
But to really appreciate that it's really an asset, that it's something that makes this institution unique and it has value.

26:02.622 --> 26:05.807
And I would tell them not to underestimate that.

26:06.007 --> 26:20.388
I would tell them to build upon the external support that's there, that these are people that for the most part want to help and have been enormously helpful to us.

26:20.809 --> 26:25.255
But I think there's plenty of room to make that even better.

26:25.235 --> 26:43.246
And then I would say to not underestimate the importance of continuing to emphasize the value that this college has to the long-term aspirations of the university.

26:44.347 --> 26:50.618
That in terms of 2020, that there may be some areas we need to build and so forth,

26:51.256 --> 27:05.029
In my opinion, that high quality engineering and high quality business programs are essential pieces if we're going to be viewed in the way that we aspire to be viewed.

27:07.456 --> 27:14.085
You've never had to deal with any things in the courtroom, have you?

27:15.147 --> 27:16.629
Oh, yeah, I have a few.

27:17.931 --> 27:18.752
Have there been some?

27:18.832 --> 27:22.617
None involving business, but as former provost, I have.

27:22.637 --> 27:24.460
Oh, no, no, but in business.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.241
No, we really haven't.

27:25.862 --> 27:31.810
Let's see, in deaning, what are the most enjoyable parts of your 13 years here?

27:32.110 --> 27:37.201
Well, of course, you know, I've been either a dean or a vice president since 1976.

27:37.281 --> 27:45.057
So if I didn't find most of it enjoyable, I'm not very smart because I've sure kept at it for a long time.

27:45.577 --> 27:48.181
You know, I love the people part of it.

27:50.765 --> 27:55.252
I really enjoy being a dean because you're still with your colleagues.

27:56.013 --> 27:57.415
You know, I really enjoy that.

27:57.496 --> 27:58.697
I mean, I go to lunch.

27:58.938 --> 28:02.303
I'll stop down and go to lunch with

28:02.283 --> 28:06.108
some people just kind of talk about things and I really enjoy that.

28:06.128 --> 28:25.033
I enjoy meeting the business people and you know I'm still on some boards and so forth and enjoy that piece of it and at the end of the day you know I really feel like that

28:25.013 --> 28:32.863
part of an operation that we're getting better and we're moving in the right direction and

28:33.468 --> 28:46.489
hopefully hoping to solve some problems that are getting us there, but for the most part, hey, I'm fortunate to be where I am, you know, that it's a fun job.

28:47.190 --> 28:55.864
But also, were there some particular moments that you recall special joy, pride?

28:58.358 --> 29:11.301
Well, you know, most of it, I think it's kind of like in your life, you know, it's usually associated with major events, maybe those, you know, marriage, children, and that sort of thing.

29:11.321 --> 29:19.135
You know, certainly as we've made major strides forward, you know,

29:19.975 --> 29:25.184
enormous pleasure and pride in moving into this facility that turned out so well.

29:25.244 --> 29:29.512
Was there a ribbon cutting?

29:29.572 --> 29:30.774
There was.

29:31.215 --> 29:45.139
At the time that we celebrated the gift that Lowry Mays made to us, because that was a big event for this college, that it really made a statement, and also it

29:45.676 --> 29:55.508
It opened up some horizons, because it was clear that this wasn't all that was going to happen, even though it was a very generous gift.

29:58.391 --> 30:05.380
You know, I'll tell you, it was very meaningful, even though we can argue about the value of rankings and so forth.

30:05.420 --> 30:09.264
The first time that we picked up the U.S.

30:09.284 --> 30:10.806
news,

30:10.786 --> 30:17.484
rapidly turned to the page where they ranked the business schools, and for the first time we were in that set.

30:18.126 --> 30:20.172
That, you know, it felt good.

30:20.212 --> 30:21.656
Do you remember when that was?

30:22.177 --> 30:26.128
No, it would have been eight or nine years ago.

30:27.458 --> 30:32.205
And the latest one, where was A&M?

30:32.405 --> 30:39.155
Latest one, we were 21 in the undergraduate program and I believe 36 in the MBA program.

30:39.175 --> 30:42.980
And if you take out the private schools in the MBA program, we were about number 20.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.604
18, 19 or 20.

30:47.066 --> 30:56.419
So Vision 2020 for A&M to be in the top 20 public institutions

30:56.399 --> 30:59.844
Vision 2020 then carried over to business.

31:00.505 --> 31:04.110
Is that a realistic goal to be in the top ten?

31:05.713 --> 31:07.756
I think in the top ten.

31:08.336 --> 31:09.178
Isn't that what it is?

31:09.378 --> 31:10.980
That's right, top ten.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.424
Yeah, it's very realistic.

31:13.824 --> 31:18.311
We're a lot closer than most are.

31:18.972 --> 31:23.098
And unlike some programs like ag or vet...
