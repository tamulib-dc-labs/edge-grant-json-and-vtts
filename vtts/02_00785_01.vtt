WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:11.271
If you record at maximum,

00:02.242 --> 00:11.271
or you record at minimum, I believe we're ready to 
go.

00:14.094 --> 00:16.436
What I usually start off with is a little 
biographical statement. What's my name? Well, I

00:18.298 --> 00:21.581
already gave him your name and everything on the 
beginning of that beforehand. But you already

00:23.243 --> 00:28.148
gave your biographical statement to Billy 
Halford in the other interview. So unless there's

00:28.188 --> 00:31.371
anything you'd like to add in terms of change. 
Changes since then? Not really. Same old thing.

00:37.863 --> 00:45.035
And you also talked about how you came to tease, but 
I would like you to redo that one for us this time.

00:46.157 --> 00:47.018
Oh, I see. I was at General Dynamics, yeah, when I 
came here. I guess Charlie Rodenberger invited me

00:51.105 --> 00:54.510
to come make a speech. I don't know. I did that. But 
in talking to Fred Benson, I complained about the

00:58.486 --> 01:04.934
fact that there wasn't a space program at A&M. And 
like Fred Benson does, he says, well, won't you

01:06.436 --> 01:13.204
come fix that? So that's how I came here and started 
the space program. There was one grant that they

01:17.069 --> 01:19.071
had. One grant, yeah. John Calhoun had gotten a 
grant, the first NASA grant in the state of Texas.

01:26.903 --> 01:30.588
And I guess that grant ran until about two years 
ago. Was it continuous grant? It was almost 20

01:32.591 --> 01:34.173
years. He got it in 62, and I came here in 63, but they 
hadn't even done anything with it. They just had

01:41.022 --> 01:42.564
it. So you came specifically to head the Space 
Technology Division, and it was created when you

01:42.584 --> 01:47.771
came? Right.

01:50.996 --> 01:55.662
What type of space research was done during the 
60s?

01:57.515 --> 02:00.418
I've got that, yeah. Have you seen this? I've got a 
copy of it. Okay, that will give you... We tried to

02:03.322 --> 02:17.999
broaden it out into the whole university, and to 
some extent we did, but it still was, I'd say,

02:03.322 --> 02:17.999
three-quarters engineering. Really, Rice took 
over the space science part of it. And our program

02:27.248 --> 02:38.360
was primarily engineering, although there were 
some over in the science college. Of course, our

02:38.380 --> 02:42.685
wind tunnel was used by NASA throughout and still 
is. Was it used during the 60s? When did you revamp

02:46.629 --> 02:48.871
it? Yeah, it was in the late 60s that they started 
using the wind tunnel.

02:57.067 --> 03:00.812
work on reentry projects. But it got heavily used 
when they started the space shuttle design. But I

03:06.039 --> 03:09.544
knew it had been there, and you'd said that when you 
came it was filled with hay. When was it that it was

03:09.885 --> 03:11.868
cleared out? Oh, it was cleared. We got the hay out 
of it in a couple of years.

03:18.817 --> 03:23.604
But I wasn't sure if it had just laid dormant until 
the shuttle program, or if it had been in use. No, it

03:23.944 --> 03:26.668
had been in use before that. Dr. Strickland, who 
died, was in our space, heavily sponsored by NASA,

03:27.087 --> 03:44.493
mainly in structures research and nose cone 
re-entry

03:27.087 --> 03:44.493
research. There have been few changes in T's 
administration since you've been here. Yes.

03:53.247 --> 03:54.208
I guess for Let's see, I got here in 63, and I was made 
associate director by Benson and Ludeke when

03:55.673 --> 04:06.291
Ludeke was there. See, he was associate director, 
and then was made acting president. And I can't

04:11.339 --> 04:13.423
remember exactly when that was. But it probably 
was late 60s or 70s. So I've been associate

04:21.222 --> 04:25.328
director for probably 15 years. 70

04:25.348 --> 04:31.496
is when you became associate assistant in 63. 
Okay, and associate in 70. Yeah, that makes sense.

04:37.023 --> 04:44.233
Were you here when Cahan was still here? Cahan, he 
was with the Research Foundation. Oh, Cahan.

04:48.659 --> 04:49.180
Cahan, okay. Cahan. No, I wasn't. He left when I got 
here. Did you notice any major change in the

04:53.944 --> 05:00.791
direction T's took in research when Rudder died? 
No. I have seen no major change in T's type or thrust

05:03.614 --> 05:13.203
of research since I've been here, and I still don't 
see any. What do you see as the major thrust? It's

05:15.245 --> 05:18.128
applied research. CTs is a separate state agency, 
and its real role as far as its creators, and that's

05:18.277 --> 05:35.375
the state legislature, is industrial 
development, not higher education. So most of our

05:36.616 --> 05:39.359
research has been applied. It has been heavily 
associated with Texas industry and national

05:39.379 --> 05:46.326
industry to some extent. But not like Harvard or 
Yale. We're very proud of doing applied research.

05:57.574 --> 06:05.282
We do basic, but I don't ever remember any strong 
thrust to do basic research. Nor do I see any now.

06:09.306 --> 06:12.229
With the changes in upper administration that 
you've the changes between reporting to the

06:12.766 --> 06:16.911
chancellor and the president. Has that changed 
your roles? My role? No. Definitely. I've been

06:24.020 --> 06:26.683
very fortunate.

06:29.186 --> 06:33.130
Benson is an absolutely gorgeous boss. He lets you 
do your job. And I don't see why it's important.

06:37.996 --> 06:40.940
They're both pretty much alike. And I have run the 
program. And they've done the politicking, which

06:44.322 --> 06:51.291
is the way I want it. So by running the program, what 
do you mean? All of the division had to report for

06:53.995 --> 06:56.278
me. Has that been that way since you became an 
associate? Always has been that way. Was it that

07:02.025 --> 07:04.809
way in the 60s, too, when you were assistant? No, 
not when I was assistant. That occurred. See, at

07:09.695 --> 07:13.620
one time... TTI reported to me also. But see, I sit 
in the line. And that's the way I'm going to play.

07:27.374 --> 07:30.837
Who do you deal with outside the system? Outside 
the A&M system? Well, I have up until six or seven

07:35.361 --> 07:42.628
years ago. dealt with Washington a great deal, and 
all the sponsors, NSF, and the Department of

07:43.385 --> 07:50.913
Defense. See, I was in the Army 20 years. It's 
incredible.

07:56.698 --> 07:58.921
In the last six years, I haven't done that. Dr. Bain 
has done most of that. So in the recent past, I have

08:02.124 --> 08:10.472
strictly run the Engineering Experiment 
Station. And done very little dealing outside the

08:10.753 --> 08:13.155
system. I know in the 60s. In the early days, of 
course, I was the leg man to get the Tate Building

08:15.338 --> 08:22.085
built. So I spent a couple of years in Washington 
almost. Whose idea was the Tate Building?

08:27.711 --> 08:28.192
Winardi.

08:30.815 --> 08:34.659
His original idea didn't happen. He wanted it to be 
an activation analysis building. That was his

08:39.624 --> 08:40.845
main interest. That was his claim to fame. But that 
wasn't broad enough to sell a building in Nassau.

08:47.625 --> 08:54.493
So really, this report was a dedication to the 
building. But who got the building? Then you doubt

08:56.195 --> 08:57.696
about that. Only Teague got the building. All I did 
was make it reasonable for Nassau to give it to us.

09:07.227 --> 09:11.212
But had it not been for Teague, it wouldn't be 
there. I think everybody would say. But they had a

09:13.244 --> 09:16.989
reasonable reason to give it to us. According to 
letters written back and forth to the president at

09:17.009 --> 09:28.163
that time, in 1963 when they appointed you 
assistant director, you were supposed to be the

09:17.009 --> 09:28.163
wonder child of grant money. There's no such thing 
as the wonder child of grant money. Do you know how

09:32.188 --> 09:33.510
you get grant money? How do you get it? Very, very 
simple. You find a man who can do the job that

09:37.295 --> 09:42.762
somebody wants done and has some money. And then 
you arrange to get them face-to-face, the two

09:43.720 --> 09:54.017
people who technically know the details of what's 
going on. Now, to get them face-to-face takes some

09:55.339 --> 09:59.525
doing, and I'm rather good at that. But nobody can 
get somebody else a grant, unless it's politics,

10:00.167 --> 10:08.720
and you can't live on politics. What gets you a 
grant is to... He's technically competent to do a

10:11.463 --> 10:18.852
job a man wants done who's got some money to pay for. 
It's that simple. But you've got to get the two

10:20.795 --> 10:21.936
together. You've got to get them together. Is that 
what TEAS does, in your opinion? Yeah, that's what

10:25.361 --> 10:27.423
TEAS does. TEAS knows the talent throughout 
engineering, and it knows the problems

10:28.845 --> 10:36.855
throughout the country. And you hear, well... 
Right now, for example, the Air Force very much

10:40.859 --> 10:49.989
wants to apply artificial intelligence to 
manufacturing. We know that because Dick Thomas

10:50.009 --> 10:55.175
is on a committee of the Air Force that's working on 
that. And then we know that Don Phillips in

10:56.816 --> 11:01.842
industrial is an expert in that. And then the two 
get like they did two weeks ago. And man, it

11:06.867 --> 11:09.330
happens. It's almost a cinch. It is difficult. 
Well, you've got to know it. If you weren't... If

11:16.334 --> 11:21.320
you've got talented people, getting grants is no 
problem.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.344
We don't have a money problem. We have a people 
problem. We need more people. Need more people in

11:27.608 --> 11:31.873
the university willing to do research? Well, see, 
engineering has been growing so fast. So you have a

11:38.302 --> 11:40.905
combination of problems. One, the teaching loads 
are unbelievable, which makes it difficult to

11:40.925 --> 11:50.778
talk some guy into doing research when he's 
teaching more than he should anyway. And you can't

11:52.059 --> 11:53.902
do that for too long. And I think that's coming 
around. But for the last couple of years, it's been

11:57.586 --> 12:00.630
pretty bad. But it's recognized, and once it is, 
and the people who can fix it know it's a problem, it

12:02.011 --> 12:08.840
gets fixed. But it takes a long time. Did you have 
the same problem with teaching loads in the 60s?

12:14.668 --> 12:16.711
They were pretty good about giving you release 
time? Yeah. See, the difference, really, in

12:19.155 --> 12:29.689
engineering, if you are doing research, you go off 
of this budget. the teaching budget, and you go on

12:29.956 --> 12:32.941
to the research budget. So if there's any cheating 
going on, it becomes real obvious. And this

12:38.990 --> 12:57.178
arrangement, once you, you're always gonna have 
these problems in a growth pattern because

12:38.990 --> 12:57.178
there's an inertia in what the legislature does 
and what we can do. But once you recognize the

12:57.631 --> 13:03.220
problem, it can be fixed because we have the 
organization to do it. Some people don't. We do.

13:07.586 --> 13:20.566
Did you notice, not here at T's because you weren't 
here by then, in the late 50s with Sputnik and you

13:07.586 --> 13:20.566
were in the Department of Defense, did that really 
make a difference? Sputnik was way before the late

13:22.209 --> 13:24.212
50s. I was at White Sands Proving Ground when 
Sputnik went up. Are those 57? Okay. 57? I'm sorry,

13:36.526 --> 13:38.169
but you're right. But I wasn't here. I was at White 
Sands. Yeah, right. But did you notice there that

13:41.654 --> 13:47.262
money started being freed up for research? Yeah, 
it did. Have there been any other... events like

13:53.302 --> 13:59.250
that that you remember since you've been here that 
have caused money for particular types of

13:53.302 --> 13:59.250
research? It

13:59.370 --> 14:12.348
definitely has occurred during the Reagan 
administration, particularly for basic

13:59.370 --> 14:12.348
research. See, the kind of research engineers do 
is not nearly as hard to find money for as the kind of

14:12.368 --> 14:22.903
research the science college does. It's just 
human nature. They can see an end product in what

14:26.484 --> 14:30.490
we're doing. And they're willing to put the money 
up if they need the end product. But since Regan

14:35.137 --> 14:52.823
took office, and you can read this almost any 
place, particularly writings by the head of the

14:35.137 --> 14:52.823
National Science Foundation, he certainly has

14:35.137 --> 14:52.823
a somewhat bias, but I do know money for basic 
research has increased about 50% in the last two or

14:53.512 --> 15:01.144
three years. And we're just beginning to feel 
that. And we do need to do more basic research, but

15:05.430 --> 15:09.957
people haven't been willing to pay for it. I do see a 
trend that they may be willing to pay for it. But

15:15.986 --> 15:21.915
what we do, somebody's got to pay for

15:15.986 --> 15:21.915
it.

15:24.865 --> 15:30.674
What was the, I don't know if you know, but the 
purpose of... And I'll tell you why Reagan's doing

15:24.865 --> 15:30.674
that. He knows this country's in deep trouble 
economically. The Japanese are skinning us. The

15:38.125 --> 15:40.129
Germans are skinning us. And the reason he's doing 
it is that he feels that will improve our economic

15:40.149 --> 15:46.759
posture. And he's right. It will. It'll take a 
while to do it. You've got to have the knowledge.

15:52.910 --> 16:05.986
And you'll also notice the National Science 
Foundation right now is putting way more emphasis

15:52.910 --> 16:05.986
on engineering research than they have in the 
past. They plan to quadruple the money spent on

16:06.006 --> 16:14.176
engineering in the next three years for the same 
reason, economics. So there's more money for

16:14.857 --> 16:19.023
basic science research, but... Both in 
engineering and the sciences. And engineering is

16:22.173 --> 16:28.580
being emphasized all over the place because this 
is where you're going to improve the economics.

16:30.161 --> 16:33.625
We've forgotten how to build things cheap that 
work.

16:37.369 --> 16:42.274
You haven't seen any of the cyclical moves before 
while you were here? There was a very definite

16:43.215 --> 16:50.543
downtrend in the overall research budget. up 
until about three years ago. I guess you'd say from

16:55.071 --> 17:00.880
70 to 79.

17:02.663 --> 17:10.054
Before that, 60 to 70, there was money everywhere, 
and they didn't know what to do with it. They're

17:10.255 --> 17:11.416
cyclic, yeah. It was a general slow downturn. It 
wasn't any major crash of no funds available. I'm

17:15.923 --> 17:19.669
hoping that right now there's some sense being put 
into it. but also a definite increase in funds

17:20.577 --> 17:26.185
available. There's no question but what Texas 
does not get its fair share. Of national money?

17:31.854 --> 17:33.336
That's right. They do not. For example, there's 
not a national laboratory in the state. There's

17:38.924 --> 17:41.147
three in New Mexico. National laboratory? Los 
Alamos. Oh,

17:44.672 --> 17:48.157
okay. That's right. You already... I think you 
already stated your view on the role of TEAS in

17:50.783 --> 17:56.111
education, but I'd like to know. My view on what? 
TEAS role in education? TEAS basic role, as far as

18:00.098 --> 18:09.092
the legislature is concerned, who, by the way, has 
the money that we get from the state. And that is

18:09.492 --> 18:14.220
only about 20% of our budget. Their opinion of what 
TEAS is supposed to do is, to improve the economic

18:19.201 --> 18:24.287
stature of the state of Texas. And if somebody out 
there goes and tells them, yeah, that's what

18:24.307 --> 18:29.654
they're doing, we've got no problems. But if 
somebody out there goes and tells them, they're

18:30.815 --> 18:39.947
just paying graduate students to go to school, 
we're in deep trouble. That's why when we hire a

18:39.967 --> 18:45.454
graduate student, he produces something. And he 
works the hours he's supposed to work. on what we

18:50.032 --> 18:55.860
feel will benefit the state, not to get him an 
education. But that just also happens to be, in

18:56.721 --> 19:02.228
most cases, a byproduct of the whole process. Not 
only does he get a realistic job to work on,

19:03.670 --> 19:14.785
something that he'll really learn something 
from, but it makes him responsible. I don't

19:15.647 --> 19:18.250
believe in giving a kid some money to go to school. 
First of all, you dream up a project for him. It's

19:23.353 --> 19:24.974
unrealistic. You can't kid these kids. Pardon the 
pun. They know when they're producing something

19:30.339 --> 19:32.641
worthwhile. And they want to. And that is why the 
way we do it is both an advantage to the state and to

19:35.523 --> 19:45.972
the kids' education. What about the role of 
teasing, disseminating information? It is

19:50.663 --> 19:58.114
absolutely worthless to do research, write it up, 
and put it on the shelf. You've got to get it used and

19:59.336 --> 20:02.180
out on the street. And I tell you who's a little bit 
better than Tease at doing that. That's TTI. What

20:09.851 --> 20:13.697
they do gets put on the highway and saves lives. And 
we've learned a lot from them on how to get it out and

20:14.378 --> 20:19.405
get it used. One outlet is this Invent program, 
which is to take the results of research and

20:20.313 --> 20:31.284
actually start businesses. And we have no 
apologies for doing that whatsoever. What about

20:39.632 --> 20:43.596
the publications and the change in publications? 
I know this has been the major improvement in T's

20:43.676 --> 20:48.261
under Porter. a major there have been many but he 
has done a gorgeous job and so has penny he's backed

20:49.152 --> 21:17.573
her and she's done it yeah and really getting 
worthwhile stuff up to then i paid for a crummy deal

20:49.152 --> 21:17.573
that frankly wasn't any good and i think penny is 
just getting started I think give her two more

21:18.937 --> 21:25.284
years, I'll give her three. Key's publications 
will be equivalent to Harvard and MIT, but in a

21:27.687 --> 21:39.941
different vein, in fact, a much more useful vein 
than theirs. But we will be the technical

21:39.961 --> 21:44.927
publication for the state of Texas. Now, you're 
talking about the thing you paid for? You're

21:48.379 --> 21:49.320
talking about the technical bulletin? I'm 
talking about whatever penny puts together. No, I

21:51.842 --> 21:54.204
mean... My windows may become... Yeah. Or it may be 
something else. I'm talking... I meant

21:57.167 --> 22:08.157
historically, that the thing you said you weren't 
proud of... Oh, we did a...

21:57.167 --> 22:08.157
Did you ever know Horn? I'm interviewing him 
tomorrow afternoon. Horn? Well, Horn ran

22:12.461 --> 22:16.264
publications for Tees for years, and... Until 
about the time you came. Yeah. And it was so bad that

22:20.044 --> 22:24.230
I just shut it down. It wasn't worth the money. And 
then we got a little bit ashamed of that and put out a

22:27.534 --> 22:40.792
quarterly, very technical, unsexy book.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.416
It was technically sound. But I doubt anybody ever 
looked at it. I have. The other flame cover, just

22:48.906 --> 22:52.490
weird. But you started that in 72. You started that 
back up again. That was because you felt you were

22:57.996 --> 23:00.618
shamed into it? Well, we weren't publishing 
anything.

23:08.326 --> 23:08.907
Yeah, I'm shamed into it. What does that do for the 
visibility of the organization? or would help

23:12.640 --> 23:16.604
some with a limited clientele. What would happen, 
I'm sure, is someone who was extremely interested

23:17.145 --> 23:28.236
technically in one of the three or four articles 
would probably get some good out of it. But that's a

23:28.256 --> 23:29.998
pretty limited audience. Because you can't, it 
can't be broad enough. And we didn't have anybody

23:36.464 --> 23:38.827
knew how to do it. This is the truth. I didn't. Is 
there a particular time period in Tees that you

23:43.623 --> 23:50.290
feel was the low point? In Tees?

23:55.875 --> 23:56.416
No. When I got here in Tees, I had about less than a 
half million dollar budget. And the

24:05.685 --> 24:11.250
administration consisted of Mr. Blevins, who 
worked for a bank in town, And the kids go blind, and

24:11.720 --> 24:16.825
that's all. And it has been a rather reasonable, 
steady growth. I don't think you'll find any dips

24:21.550 --> 24:24.012
anywhere in it. I don't believe there was ever a 
fallback year. It's been going along on the

24:33.862 --> 24:39.347
average about 15, 20% a year. I don't recall any low 
spots. The

24:47.299 --> 25:08.320
changes

24:47.299 --> 25:08.320
from the 60s to the 70s,

24:47.299 --> 25:08.320
Dean Benson is characterizing as the 60s as a 
building parade of resources and the 70s a

24:47.299 --> 25:08.320
utilization of those. Is that the same way you 
would characterize them? The 60s, see I got here in

25:10.664 --> 25:22.938
63 and I had a fairly limited role until I was made 
associate director.

25:30.006 --> 25:36.553
I guess I would say there just wasn't a critical 
mass until about 70. By that I mean you had enough

25:37.512 --> 25:44.739
going to be flexible enough to ride out any 
problems. And that's the key to teeth. It's very

25:47.923 --> 25:49.064
flexible. And we shut things down if they don't 
work. Such as? Such as the remote sensing center.

25:56.571 --> 25:58.533
We shut it down two weeks ago. Not because it was, it 
was extremely good for But right now, things are

26:05.305 --> 26:15.295
changing, and the people involved would rather be 
involved in electrical engineering.

26:19.680 --> 26:25.586
But that flexibility is key to it, and our people 
are flexible.

26:28.889 --> 26:34.755
Well, you've seen how environmental goes up and 
then it went down. The people involved didn't

26:35.191 --> 26:45.125
change, and they went over to this strategic 
petroleum reserve, and that's going to go away.

26:45.145 --> 26:58.765
But those people will be, they'll look ahead, 
they'll start in hazardous waste studies, you

26:45.145 --> 26:58.765
watch me, and they won't run out of money, and they 
won't run out of a job, but they'll shift. They

27:00.508 --> 27:04.894
can't change their talents, but they can change 
what they're applying to. And this happens all the

27:05.768 --> 27:09.733
time. I know the interdisciplinary programs have 
expanded rapidly in the last few years. Yeah.

27:19.086 --> 27:26.055
That, of course, is the part that takes the most 
putting together. But it also is the part that can

27:27.717 --> 27:35.067
take on bigger jobs.

27:36.076 --> 27:49.055
You may look at ME, industrial, EE, and not realize 
that when you see ME, there's very few programs in

27:36.076 --> 27:49.055
ME that are just ME. ME may be taking the lead role, 
but there'll be EEs involved, like in the robotics

27:49.075 --> 27:59.129
program, industrial engineers involved. And 
then you go over to the EE program and you see

27:59.590 --> 28:04.817
microelectronics. Will there be chemical 
engineers involved? EE just happens to be taking

28:08.337 --> 28:10.741
the lead role. So in my mind, those programs 
labeled MEE are just as interdisciplinary as the

28:11.742 --> 28:19.174
others. And they have to be. Have they been that way 
ever since you've been here? That has been my

28:24.442 --> 28:28.989
greatest contribution. I knew it had to happen. 
See, I ran research at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in

28:30.170 --> 28:33.876
White Sands. And there's nothing worthwhile you 
can do with one discipline, in my opinion. There's

28:40.903 --> 28:45.988
no such thing as ME research or EE research. It's 
impossible. So that sense of cooperation is what

28:48.070 --> 28:50.914
you've tried to work with? That is why engineering 
at A&M is different from most places. Now, MFT can

28:59.363 --> 29:03.087
do the same thing, probably a little better. But 
there's not many schools that can. Was there

29:09.612 --> 29:14.860
interdisciplinary cooperation before you 
became associate director? Some.

29:18.566 --> 29:23.014
The problem just wasn't that big. It's got to reach 
the critical mass before you can do that.

29:31.282 --> 29:33.004
And that's what's fun. When do you think it reached 
the critical mass? Oh, I'd say, yeah, that's

29:36.068 --> 29:42.838
probably 74 or 75. And that being having the talent 
and the equipment? And what really, when people

29:49.507 --> 29:57.177
start coming to you, then you know you're there. 
Now this hasn't happened in all areas, but it's

29:57.197 --> 30:01.002
happened in many areas. We really don't have to 
look for research in turbomachinery anymore.

30:12.551 --> 30:17.777
What we do in remote sensing, we didn't have to look 
for it. And then that sort of tailed off. So you have

30:21.341 --> 30:23.283
to shift with it. There were, oh, eight years ago, 
we didn't have to look for any remote sensing

30:25.065 --> 30:30.972
research. But that has changed. So we're 
changing. What about the data processing center?

30:38.902 --> 30:41.505
I know it was divorced from an organization. It 
never should have been under TEAS in the first

30:41.786 --> 30:44.570
place. The only reason it was is TEAS was the only 
place that could underwrite it. It just so

30:54.203 --> 30:57.327
happened that there wasn't a lot of underwriting 
needed. But when you get up to a $2 million and $3

30:58.109 --> 31:01.313
million budget, Somebody's gotta be able to, in 
case there's a million dollar loss one year, cover

31:01.867 --> 31:10.557
it, because the people gotta get paid. So the only 
reason it was ever in Teves was the ability to

31:11.518 --> 31:17.245
underwrite it. And also, as I was near when they 
started, it could have been considered, at that

31:18.927 --> 31:28.498
time, more research than service. But then it got 
to be strictly service. It should definitely have

31:33.026 --> 31:36.911
left Tees many years ago. But they couldn't get the 
act together and find a way to underwrite it. They

31:42.378 --> 31:43.199
finally did. And we were very happy to say sign art 
to you fellows. Oh, it was a great bunch of people

31:48.906 --> 31:53.072
and they did a gorgeous job. But it really wasn't 
our job to provide computing to the whole

31:53.092 --> 31:58.458
university. It was a I wrote his research. Are 
there any other? And there was a pain in the neck.

32:08.117 --> 32:11.342
Are there any other divisions that have been pains 
in the neck that you'd like to? Nuclear Science

32:13.064 --> 32:14.246
Center. That's what I was going to ask you about. 
That's been changed somewhat a little in the last

32:17.411 --> 32:21.417
few years too, hasn't it? Not really. It's been 
losing about a quarter of a million dollars a year,

32:22.138 --> 32:28.727
as long as I can remember. But it's now going 
through the... Yes, right. It did report directly

32:35.202 --> 32:41.989
to me and not report to the department.

32:42.389 --> 32:46.694
Is that at their instigation or at T's 
instigation? Our instigation. What will that do,

32:47.435 --> 32:50.718
hopefully?

32:54.522 --> 32:56.704
Well, it hadn't worked the other way. just a new 
experiment the real hope was see there had been no

32:56.853 --> 33:25.138
nuclear research in engineering up until well 
when Dr. Erdman came the hope was that he would

32:56.853 --> 33:25.138
increase the nuclear engineering research 
program to the point that it would justify the

32:56.853 --> 33:25.138
reactor most of the research at the reactor has 
been done at The use of it has been by the science

33:26.030 --> 33:34.880
college and agriculture and vet medicine, not 
engineering. So what we've been doing is

33:36.501 --> 33:44.910
underwriting their research program about a 
quarter of a million dollars a year, which is OK.

33:46.412 --> 33:47.813
But we just seem not. So we're stirring around and 
trying to find a better arrangement. And whether

33:55.139 --> 34:03.328
we will or not, I don't know the answer, really. We 
don't have enough data at this point. I don't even

34:06.691 --> 34:16.762
really know how much these other colleges are 
interested in it. They obviously aren't

34:16.782 --> 34:21.467
interested enough to pay for it. I mean, if you're 
not going to make them pay for it, why are they going

34:22.088 --> 34:26.314
to volunteer? If it's to the benefit of the whole, 
we can live with that. But is it? I don't know. I'm

34:32.261 --> 34:36.607
trying to find out, and I'll bet I'll take it. 
That's the present project, right? I know that,

34:40.913 --> 34:51.707
I'm trying to remember the name of the

34:40.913 --> 34:51.707
fluid measurement division or something. Well, 
now that goes on in aerospace. No, it's the, I can't

34:57.015 --> 35:05.528
remember, Hall, Kenneth Hall's? Oh, 
thermodynamic research. Thermodynamics, okay,

35:07.051 --> 35:08.213
yeah. I talked to him last week, and he was telling 
me about the fact that TEAS had essentially bought

35:08.693 --> 35:15.965
them from the Research Foundation. Are there 
other organizations that you've done that with?

35:20.003 --> 35:23.386
Well, we sure bailed them out. And it worked. And it 
absolutely worked. No, I don't guess so. That was

35:31.454 --> 35:33.816
about as bad a deal as I ever got. It turned around 
pretty fast, though. Yeah, it turned around real

35:37.259 --> 35:38.881
fast. And I blame that all on Dick Hall. Dick Hall's 
a good man. That was just a risk you took? It's not

35:47.138 --> 35:50.121
one you generally have taken before? No, it isn't 
normal.

35:54.305 --> 36:01.211
The fan testing research has been around forever 
and ever and ever. Yeah, see that's another thing

36:01.231 --> 36:03.213
we're changing. Okay, how are you changing that? 
Well, for years it's been strictly, it does most of

36:05.355 --> 36:14.023
the testing of air moving machines in this 
country. And it is accepted by all of the industry

36:15.067 --> 36:23.015
as something they believe. If we put out the data, 
they believe it. In other words, if we say this fan

36:26.619 --> 36:34.607
will move this much air per minute, then they 
believe us. They don't have to check it or

36:34.667 --> 36:37.130
anything. And we want to continue that. But that's 
not research. So what I've done is turn that whole

36:41.425 --> 36:59.285
program over to the ME department, because we have 
a very fine opportunity now to really do research

36:41.425 --> 36:59.285
in HVAC, which is heating, ventilating, and air 
conditioning. And there is an organization that

36:59.305 --> 37:07.054
wants to join with us and build a program like we 
have in turbo machinery. And this was done. by ME

37:10.754 --> 37:15.820
people and industrial and led by ME. So the attempt 
to utilize that facility, because there's a lot of

37:15.840 --> 37:26.994
stuff out there, better rather than just testing 
things. We have turned it over to ME and say, OK,

37:27.715 --> 37:31.499
it's yours. Get on with some research, and here's 
some resources to get you going. So we're just

37:39.121 --> 37:44.286
trying to broaden it from a testing program to a 
testing and research program. But still part of

37:44.306 --> 37:45.528
TEAS? Yes. Through the ME department?

37:50.193 --> 37:50.433
Yeah. In the interdisciplinary aspects, Invent 
is one of the big- Hot deal. Yeah, the hot deal of the

37:59.402 --> 38:01.304
time. And from other interviews I've had, part of 
the problem that they're coming across with

38:07.775 --> 38:20.053
Invent is that it's not a win-win situation in 
terms of the need for publications from the

38:07.775 --> 38:20.053
faculty standpoint. Is that something that 
you're finding with Invent, or is that the problem

38:20.474 --> 38:28.045
with other teachers? It's peculiar. This need for 
publications is

38:37.559 --> 39:04.866
wrong i mean there is a need the need is to get 
promoted right and in my opinion when you publish

38:37.559 --> 39:04.866
something it is immediately worthless you can't 
sell it you're giving it away right if i patent it

38:37.559 --> 39:04.866
it's a different matter so i'm not that hung up on 
publication but at the moment at least And it seems

39:05.403 --> 39:09.608
to have gotten worse in the last three or four 
years. This hang-up on publication is copying

39:10.308 --> 39:14.113
Harvard and Yale. They do it and that for 40 years. 
It gets 400 years. So we're copying them, or trying

39:19.338 --> 39:23.243
to, rather than do our own thing. I think it'll ease 
off. That heat will go away and become reasonable

39:27.587 --> 39:35.376
again, as it was under Benson.

39:36.098 --> 39:40.024
There was never that fear in the faculty. I know 
many who did real well and never published

39:41.927 --> 39:49.118
anything, but produced a lot. I think that'll go 
away. It's a trend at the moment. It won't last. Not

39:54.707 --> 39:55.188
here. It is a problem. It surfaces and is more 
visible in the event. But it's a problem in many

40:05.090 --> 40:09.014
ways. But anytime you set something in concrete 
and start counting something, you know, did you do

40:09.034 --> 40:16.682
one this move? You're crazy. Everything won't 
work. And that'll go away. That's just people. Do

40:22.589 --> 40:23.550
you think it'll... It'll get reasonable again. 
Certainly we want to publish, but we don't want

40:26.193 --> 40:29.376
to... run everybody's life on how many, whether 
they published two this month or only one. That's

40:37.479 --> 40:40.363
dumb. But it's a fear in the faculty that if they 
involve their self within VET at the moment is

40:41.425 --> 40:52.482
negative. I tell you how I can fix that real quick. 
Pay them a little bit more money. Then the fear will

40:56.812 --> 40:59.014
go away. You're not going to let it stop inventing. 
No, no way. It will not stop inventing. I guarantee

41:05.560 --> 41:06.741
you that. The Research Foundation, you— I was a 
member of that austere group at one time. It was a

41:17.712 --> 41:19.654
very fine organization. It had a few problems. It 
only had one, really. It cost too much. Is it living

41:27.845 --> 41:30.909
up to its expenses? Is it paying for itself? Their 
cost of doing what they do, percentage-wise, see,

41:33.973 --> 41:43.346
what they do is take a certain percent of the 
indirect cost. Are you saying they could cut

41:43.706 --> 41:45.188
costs? Yes, and do the same thing. And also, in the 
case of the foundation and fees, there's a

41:48.733 --> 41:56.704
duplication there that needs to be studied. and 
either the duplication removed from TEAS or from

41:57.494 --> 42:01.998
the foundation. There's not nearly that much 
duplication in what they do for the university in

42:03.039 --> 42:16.573
that the university doesn't have much of a 
research accounting or management or anything

42:03.039 --> 42:16.573
like that. So what the, my feeling is the 
foundation is geared to serve the university and

42:18.435 --> 42:26.843
it's over geared to serve TEAS. Another solution 
would be for us to cut back on our county, and we're

42:27.548 --> 42:33.134
willing to do that. If a study says that's what you 
ought to do, nobody's ever looked at it. And one of

42:40.141 --> 42:49.451
these days, the federal government's going to 
look at it and say, you're indirect costs are too

42:40.141 --> 42:49.451
high because you're duplicating. And you people 
fix it, or we're going to. So we better fix it. And

42:56.219 --> 42:58.122
we're thinking about doing it. It took me a lot of 
reading to understand the relationship. But the

43:00.485 --> 43:02.208
foundation's valuable. For example, they do all 
the negotiating with the federal agencies for us.

43:10.039 --> 43:11.180
And they know how to do it. And there's always 
quirks with the different federal agencies that

43:13.463 --> 43:18.651
they understand. If we didn't have them, we'd have 
to step up to do that. So they're valuable to us. I

43:26.290 --> 43:29.455
don't think they're quite as valuable as they 
cost. That's the problem. And it's not. Anything

43:33.261 --> 43:34.483
can't be fixed. Do they deal only with federal 
guys? Mainly. Federal and industry. They do no

43:39.650 --> 43:41.674
dealings with the state. And see, we do a lot of 
research for the state. So we have to have a staff to

43:44.778 --> 43:48.504
do that. They're primarily with the federal 
government.

43:55.805 --> 44:02.576
Have you noticed a change in funding in terms of 
percentage, federal, industry? Not in our case.

44:06.642 --> 44:07.323
Not really. Perhaps industry has increased 
modestly,

44:09.086 --> 44:21.004
and federal percentage has gone down slightly. I 
like the way we have it. We probably have the

44:24.273 --> 44:30.999
highest percentage of industry support of any 
engineering complex in the country. Quite a bit.

44:32.900 --> 44:35.403
Probably twice as much. Which

44:35.423 --> 44:40.227
is real nice. I'll take a job with industry any day 
before I will the federal government. And then if

44:46.572 --> 44:51.076
you want to look at the federal government, 
there's good ones and bad ones. The best one is DOD.

44:54.935 --> 44:56.276
They know what they're doing. They do their 
homework. And if you do a good job, they know it. And

45:02.302 --> 45:06.226
there's less chupac type stuff. I guess the worst 
one up to date is NSF. They don't know what they're

45:13.493 --> 45:14.734
doing. But I believe they may be learning. That's 
not really true. I hope. They finally decided

45:19.519 --> 45:22.562
engineering's important. The

45:24.382 --> 45:40.023
changes in

45:24.382 --> 45:40.023
TEAS, we're also trying to look at how their change 
compared to the other engineering experience

45:24.382 --> 45:40.023
stations in the nation. And I know from my research 
that there was, until the mid-50s,

45:41.225 --> 45:52.060
a journal of the Engineering Division of Land 
Grant the association land grants. Is there

45:53.886 --> 45:54.962
anything?
