00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:10.767
When I was married to you, the faculty complained that some students, after they took their third quiz, stopped coming to class.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:11.649
That's probably true.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:12.190
Yes.

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:14.274
I don't question that.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.462
I probably would have done the same thing as an undergraduate.

00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:28.845
I found in my classes that if I gave a quiz to graduating seniors only fairly late, I could keep them coming a little later.

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:32.589
I always thought the faculty should have been clever enough to deal with that.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.439
Let's see, did you ever, the Williams sense of humor, do you remember any examples of that?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.943
Mostly by legend, and I think

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:52.043
one of the things that made Dr. Williams and General Rutter so

00:00:54.166 --> 00:01:00.796
almost bigger than life in many respects, is that there were lots of stories told about both of them.

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:03.860
Lots of faculty members.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:13.494
When we first came here, Rutter was here, and faculty members used to spend an inordinate amount of time at parties and so forth discussing what does Rutter really want.

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:14.956
Is he going to run for governor?

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:17.440
Or actually, usually for the Senate.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.443
Does he want to be Secretary of the Army?

00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:21.206
What does he really want?

00:01:21.487 --> 00:01:25.513
I know now from talking to Mrs. Rutter, what he really wanted was to be President of Texas A&M.

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:28.338
But Dr. Williams, too.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.965
And I think that it's good

00:01:34.328 --> 00:02:02.901
for a president one of the things that starts these rumors if they get mad at the right things they can have they can just absolutely blow up and word gets around campus and if it's the right reason to blow up it can do them some good it can be helpful the dr williams temper was pretty legendary his he was a beautiful public speaker uh he was

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.771
And Ed, I don't know if Ed told you this or not, Ed Cooper says that he lied frequently when people would ask him for copies of his speeches.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.154
He would insist that he didn't have a copy.

00:02:15.214 --> 00:02:17.357
Oh, that was just a few thoughts I had.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.999
It wasn't written out.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.807
Ed says he would have worked on the speech off and on for a week, and there would be several edits of it.

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:30.774
But there were, actually, there were stories about them.

00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:32.837
People...

00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:36.515
It's been an awful lot of time, and I just don't see that.

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:38.158
I haven't seen that.

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:51.817
Did you have the impression that the turnaround time on important items in the Williams office was fast or slow?

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:52.438
Oh, very fast.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.081
Almost incredibly fast.

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:55.943
Why?

00:02:56.824 --> 00:02:57.485
I agree with you.

00:02:57.765 --> 00:02:59.027
Why do you think it was fast?

00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:02.750
Things were far more authoritative then.

00:03:04.032 --> 00:03:07.737
Not everything had to be studied by four committees and approved.

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:22.016
Dr. Williams, and this is something else that Williams and Rutter had in common, they had the personal self-confidence to make a decision.

00:03:23.718 --> 00:03:27.563
And they had the

00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:43.787
For the most part, obviously influence of presidents with the board, Waxes and Waynes, but the personal self-confidence, they were their own men, and I think the regents recognized it.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.073
And I think they both had very effective staffs.

00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:49.734
Nelda?

00:03:49.754 --> 00:03:50.034
Oh, yeah.

00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:57.162
Nelda and Hillary, both very effective.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.316
At least, and I've talked about this with a friend who was involved.

00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:11.680
We had some extremely able administrators in.

00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:20.027
Whether you agreed with them or whether you didn't, whether you liked them or whether you didn't, he wasn't the only able administrator on campus.

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:21.649
Who were some of those others?

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:31.097
Well, the conversation I've had with my friend Randy Mattson was comparing, say, the deans back in the mid-'70s as a group.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:42.929
They were an extremely able group of people, again, with personal self-confidence, with the ability to make a decision.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.635
Yes, they were reviewed, but the review was different.

00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:54.403
They were able to stay dean long enough to see the results of some of the things they had done.

00:04:54.464 --> 00:05:01.152
And what Randy and I ask ourselves,

00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:11.281
did we think they were so able, was it a reflection of our age at the time and the age difference compared to now when they're our peers in the same?

00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:15.265
I don't think that was, that may be part of it, but I don't think that was all of it.

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:28.438
But the folks I'm talking about, I mean you had, not just the deans, but you had Tom Cherry in business, you had John Calhoun,

00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:43.694
The deans, gee, people like Fred Benson, Frank Hubert, Mac Prescott, Earl Cook, John Pearson, I mean, just go right down the line.

00:05:43.714 --> 00:05:48.639
And they were decisive.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.943
They were, to some extent, argumentative from time to time.

00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:57.548
I think they were a pretty able group.

00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:16.541
I agree with you and I think also they knew that the person in the leadership hierarchy above them was a decision maker and that they might send a recommendation up there and a decision would be made and that was it.

00:06:18.484 --> 00:06:21.510
It wouldn't bounce around a long time.

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:42.300
a couple of observations though by watching these things happen anytime you change at whatever level if you change dean if you change vice president if you change president the first six months they're going to see an awful lot of really bad ideas that have already been turned down once or twice

00:06:43.546 --> 00:07:10.853
that people will say okay we've got a new one let's run this back through again maybe we'll get to prove uh and it's and that's really pretty silly when you consider that for the most part the staff that work at each of these levels they don't turn over and they point this out uh i guess the other observation is at that point deans were not always named by search committees

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:23.040
I don't know of any evidence whatsoever and can think of only one really good reason why a search committee does a better job than an individual in hiring someone.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.303
I don't know that anyone's ever done any sort of study on it or anything else.

00:07:27.124 --> 00:07:37.374
You can make mistakes doing it either way, but I think search committees generally tend to go to a blander person.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.637
I think so, and I think also search committees suffer

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:46.866
from not feeling any responsibility for the consequences of their decision.

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:55.356
Whereas if it's an individual making that decision, he or she knows that if the appointment goes wrong, it's going to hurt there.

00:07:55.616 --> 00:07:56.557
They're going to be judged.

00:07:56.757 --> 00:07:57.238
Right.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.341
By what kind of staff they've built.

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:06.068
Now, also during that period, do you think it was helpful that

00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:12.507
that Earl Rudder and Jack Williams were president of both the institution and of the system.

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:19.292
Yes, but everything was on a smaller scale.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:19.613
Sure.

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:22.055
Very definitely it did.

00:08:22.155 --> 00:08:25.457
Jimmy Bond put that succinctly one time.

00:08:25.578 --> 00:08:29.421
He said, Mary Helen, he said it was so much more fun when we all worked for Jack Williams.

00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:32.083
He said because we knew we'd better get along.

00:08:33.204 --> 00:08:36.747
That if we didn't get along with each other, we knew there was only one tiebreaker.

00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:39.516
and we were both going to look bad if he had to break a tie.

00:08:40.397 --> 00:08:43.042
So we better figure out a way between ourselves to make it work.

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.003
And he was right.

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:47.710
Things didn't escalate.

00:08:49.092 --> 00:09:00.692
Under the present setup, and I've believed this for some time, with a chancellor symbolically at least across the street and a president here, if I were either one of those people,

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:07.594
I would tell my staff that I don't care what anyone at the other level does.

00:09:08.595 --> 00:09:11.921
You will not criticize them to your staff.

00:09:13.363 --> 00:09:14.545
I don't care what happens.

00:09:14.565 --> 00:09:15.146
You won't do it.

00:09:15.466 --> 00:09:17.490
If you want to criticize them, you criticize them to me.

00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:27.726
But most of these things that get blown up into big deals start at a fairly low level, don't really matter anyway.

00:09:28.482 --> 00:09:32.727
And by the time they keep moving up the level, they just get blown all out of proportion.

00:09:33.768 --> 00:09:40.136
And maybe it's not possible for a chancellor and a president to really get along well, but that sure doesn't help.

00:09:41.838 --> 00:09:52.431
During those years when you were in admissions, were there any admission changes that were made that were important?

00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:59.435
Well, in the 70s, in the late 70s, enrollment at Texas A&M grew almost exponentially.

00:10:01.037 --> 00:10:04.301
We were adding several thousand new students per year.

00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:09.267
Vast overcrowding, literally as well as figuratively.

00:10:10.869 --> 00:10:17.998
We had chemistry majors who got us, we were teaching chemistry labs on, freshman chemistry labs on Friday nights.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.924
We were told to hold down enrollment.

00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:27.785
It was sort of mind-boggling.

00:10:27.805 --> 00:10:37.400
Sometimes I would go from one meeting to work on a publication to recruit students, and then I'd go to a meeting that same afternoon on how to hold down enrollment.

00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:48.538
The only ways you could hold down enrollment at that point, because the admissions standards were pretty cut and dried, 800 SAT, top half-year class.

00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:50.481
I mean, that was it.

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:53.024
Everybody got in if you had that.

00:10:53.824 --> 00:11:08.399
So the only way you could control the total was on international students, and those were the biggest part of your new graduate students, and out-of-state students.

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:16.047
And so the out-of-state enrollment kept getting higher and higher, or pardon me, the standards, the requirements.

00:11:16.752 --> 00:11:40.444
And that had kind of a negative effect because when you had a undergraduate student body with an average SAT score probably of about 1030, and you had out-of-state students who had to have a minimum 1150 on the SAT, the faculty all started thinking that the out-of-state kids were smarter than the Texas kids and better prepared.

00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:43.789
No, they just had to meet a higher standard to get in.

00:11:44.697 --> 00:11:47.861
So that was a thing.

00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:50.324
Later they came in with some other ways to do it.

00:11:50.424 --> 00:11:53.288
Obviously we haven't found the right way to do it.

00:11:53.889 --> 00:12:13.894
I've always thought that as a fundraising thing, and I say this only partially, facetiously, that go through all of the things about the review and all of this and the subjective and the objective and this sort of thing, and then leave a hundred places at the end.

00:12:14.448 --> 00:12:18.736
that on the July 4th or whatever day you want to pick, you auction them off.

00:12:19.357 --> 00:12:20.620
They just go to the highest bidder.

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:24.447
And why not?

00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:31.480
I lost a lot of faith in the process that we use now.

00:12:32.022 --> 00:12:36.490
In a meeting about five years ago,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:13:05.700
with it was a committee working on ways to improve the core implementation committee that had a blue ribbon committee what needed to be done I was on the implementation committee we had a year about five six years ago when all of a sudden about mid-july they realized that the enrollment wasn't going to reach their target it wasn't they were going to be over it wasn't going to reach it so they started getting on the phone and calling

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.275
people who had been turned down to see if they were to come to A&M.

00:13:09.736 --> 00:13:12.480
Well, they didn't get too many from that.

00:13:13.262 --> 00:13:24.600
Primarily because kids had been turned down, they'd already gotten accepted somewhere else, told all their friends they were going somewhere else, you know, didn't want to go back and say, well, I just barely got in A&M.

00:13:26.824 --> 00:13:29.528
But one of the kids that was called

00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:57.017
had expressed interest in the corps cadets and he was called his mother answered the phone they said that they would like to he could now be accepted a m and so forth and his mother said well i'm sorry he was not interested he's been accepted to the united states military academy and we sat in one of those meetings and the folks from admissions

00:13:57.655 --> 00:14:03.363
tried to tell us that they were looking for something different than West Point was.

00:14:04.925 --> 00:14:12.615
And I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying, would you please name one thing that you were looking for that West Point is not?

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:21.186
Now, I realize that a mistake can be made, and they'd have been far better off to say, hey, this is one we just screwed up on.

00:14:21.206 --> 00:14:22.448
You know, we made an error.

00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:26.409
Clerical era, misread, you know.

00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:33.358
So I think it's kind of like reading tea leaves for the students in the middle.

00:14:33.678 --> 00:14:37.482
For the sake of this question, you have the power of the emperor.

00:14:37.523 --> 00:14:39.385
You don't have to explain anything to the voters.

00:14:40.586 --> 00:14:46.073
What would you have as the enrollment admission total?

00:14:46.373 --> 00:14:48.055
How large would you have the student body here?

00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:52.300
Undergraduate.

00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:57.886
Never thought about that.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.451
I don't think it is too big.

00:15:05.174 --> 00:15:19.109
And Haskell, as long as we keep getting as many kids as we get, as long as there are that many neat, sharp kids, I'd probably let in a few more.

00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.249
Right.

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:21.932
Now, would you agree with me in my personal opinion that

00:15:22.807 --> 00:15:28.145
total enrollment has almost nothing to do with reputation of quality.

00:15:28.787 --> 00:15:29.128
Oh, no.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.994
That I totally agree with you.

00:15:31.413 --> 00:15:38.321
Because I've run into a number of people who think, oh, it would hurt our reputation if we went up or down.

00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:39.583
I've tried to say, no, no, no.

00:15:40.404 --> 00:15:43.808
And I always ask them, which one is better, Michigan or Michigan State?

00:15:44.308 --> 00:15:44.689
Michigan.

00:15:44.729 --> 00:15:45.409
Which one's bigger?

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:45.910
Michigan?

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.371
No.

00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:47.372
Michigan State's.

00:15:47.552 --> 00:15:53.539
Well, and it would, it's going to hurt, as big as we are, it's going to hurt if we

00:15:54.818 --> 00:16:03.709
if we get bigger or stay big, because we'll never be able to get the faculty-staff ratio down, and that counts on a lot of the rating things that come out by different magazines to sell books.

00:16:05.992 --> 00:16:08.435
So that would be a problem.

00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:14.323
And if we went smaller now, politically, it would be extremely difficult.

00:16:14.343 --> 00:16:14.943
It would be disastrous.

00:16:15.344 --> 00:16:24.235
Because in Texas, there is still that kind of idea that, after all, I'm a taxpayer, I'm a citizen, therefore...

00:16:25.177 --> 00:16:41.776
But as long as you're talking about enrollment and admission as a political thing, it's a shame that Bill Hobby, because I think he was given evidence of having the nerve, didn't stay as a dollar a year chancellor a little longer.

00:16:44.018 --> 00:16:52.888
I personally believe that the Hopwood thing has been very poorly handled.

00:16:54.438 --> 00:17:06.257
And I think we are making a huge mistake to let the best and brightest of our minority kids go out of state to school.

00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:13.129
I mean, I think it's... And so far, mostly what we've done is have meetings and pay lip service to doing something about it.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:21.222
There wasn't a university president in the state that had the guts to say, no, we're not going to do it.

00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:33.635
Back in your real world days, let's go back again, do you remember any good anecdotes about admissions, somebody that didn't get admitted, pressure brought to bear, this sort of thing?

00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:34.917
You don't have to name names.

00:17:35.278 --> 00:17:37.843
Always, always.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:39.973
from my hometown.

00:17:40.815 --> 00:17:41.958
I brought the pressure to bear.

00:17:43.622 --> 00:17:44.383
There were twins.

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:47.291
My mother had taught them in high school.

00:17:47.491 --> 00:17:51.621
One of them made an 800 on the SAT and the other one made a 780 on the SAT.

00:17:52.002 --> 00:17:55.731
They got, one of them got turned down, the other one got accepted.

00:17:55.711 --> 00:18:08.042
I went into Cooper, after mother called me, I went into Cooper and said, my mother said for me to tell you, she taught both these boys high school English, and she's taught other kids who went to A&M that these boys can do A&M work.

00:18:09.103 --> 00:18:09.723
And they did.

00:18:09.743 --> 00:18:11.985
They both graduated.

00:18:12.005 --> 00:18:13.006
And they got admitted.

00:18:13.186 --> 00:18:14.848
Yeah, they hadn't realized they were twins.

00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:17.971
I mean, you know, they didn't mean to do that.

00:18:21.113 --> 00:18:24.216
There were always...

00:18:25.377 --> 00:18:29.816
Every year, I mean, I remember the kid from Corpus.

00:18:30.439 --> 00:18:34.898
I always used to end up, kids from South Texas always knew somebody who knew me.

00:18:35.688 --> 00:18:45.142
Kid from Carpus that we had to work on because you couldn't hold your dorm room until you had the right score on the SAT and had to work with him to get him to hold his dorm room.

00:18:45.422 --> 00:18:52.653
Kid came in here as a petroleum engineering major, had to take the SAT three times to get in.

00:18:53.754 --> 00:18:55.937
And I kept up with him the first couple of years.

00:18:56.078 --> 00:19:00.043
And he'd stop by to see me occasionally, but I watched his grades.

00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:03.889
He wasn't a gangbuster student, but he was passing.

00:19:05.337 --> 00:19:06.538
And I ran into him.

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:09.682
I'd see him every once in a while on campus.

00:19:09.702 --> 00:19:11.664
Ran into him the semester he graduated.

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:13.225
It took him five years to graduate.

00:19:13.365 --> 00:19:21.474
When I saw him, it was a couple of weeks before graduation, he grabbed me and hugged me, told me he was graduating that semester, how proud his folks were.

00:19:21.514 --> 00:19:27.801
And he looked me in the eye and he said, you didn't think I'd ever get a degree in petroleum engineering, did you?

00:19:27.821 --> 00:19:29.362
And I said, Sonny, I sure didn't.

00:19:29.763 --> 00:19:31.064
He said, my daddy didn't either.

00:19:32.085 --> 00:19:33.927
But he said, I've proved that I can do it.

00:19:35.138 --> 00:19:42.487
And it was just through hard work and digging that kid made it.

00:19:44.069 --> 00:19:45.091
There were other kids.

00:19:46.452 --> 00:19:58.487
We still have kids here who are the first person in their family to go to school and who A&M is five, six, ten times bigger than their hometown.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.192
And sometimes they need a little help.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:31.150
I've often wondered if it wouldn't be worthwhile to have a special summer program only for students that are potential admittees and start it and run it about 12 weeks and to say okay that includes real math and real English and if you take come to summer school if you can handle that

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.994
with these grades, we will admit you.

00:20:36.815 --> 00:20:50.829
Because I think that the ones that did survive, the incentive of working harder might make the difference, that they might not have worked as hard in high school as they could have.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:56.274
Well, the provisional program, I don't know for sure how it works now, but it used to be similar to that.

00:20:57.175 --> 00:21:00.158
And you had that you could offer.

00:21:00.897 --> 00:21:15.619
Ed had a good way of telling people that it wasn't, you weren't doing a kid a favor by meeting them if you didn't really believe they could graduate.

00:21:16.461 --> 00:21:20.627
That the flunking out, you know, wasn't going to do it.

00:21:21.653 --> 00:21:39.418
The ones that I dealt with primarily then were the kids who had gotten just so far messed up in the system, somehow just totally messed up in the system, and get to troubleshoot more or less.

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:42.482
I kind of enjoyed that.

00:21:43.624 --> 00:21:46.868
It was an interesting place to work.

00:21:46.949 --> 00:21:55.501
How often were you aware of an attempt to pull a string by a regent or a legislator?

00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:56.522
All the time.

00:21:58.144 --> 00:22:00.588
It worked everywhere except veterinary medicine.

00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:05.775
And who would those, would it normally be a phone call or a letter?

00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:06.676
Phone call.

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:08.419
To whom?

00:22:08.439 --> 00:22:08.859
Depends.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.363
It might be to Buckwires.

00:22:11.623 --> 00:22:13.125
It might be to the president.

00:22:13.477 --> 00:22:14.618
It might be to Ed.

00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:19.823
It might be to whoever.

00:22:25.849 --> 00:22:26.449
But it happened.

00:22:26.529 --> 00:22:31.494
It happened more on housing than it did on admission, or as much on housing at that point.

00:22:31.794 --> 00:22:33.095
Did you find them a room on campus?

00:22:33.115 --> 00:22:33.436
Oh, yeah.

00:22:34.997 --> 00:22:35.958
But it happened.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:43.365
Are you saying that in almost every case, if a regent or a legislator called, it worked?

00:22:43.885 --> 00:22:48.529
At least to some extent.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.594
They couldn't keep them here, but they could get them in.

00:22:55.516 --> 00:23:05.146
I remember one time telling, again this was Dr. Miller, telling Dr. Miller that though that one of the regents, a regent stepson wasn't going to graduate.

00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:07.288
This was two days before graduation.

00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:11.151
And Dr. Miller said, thank you for telling me.

00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:12.913
I'll call him and tell him.

00:23:12.893 --> 00:23:16.658
And he said, gee, it'd be easier if it was his son instead of his stepson.

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:22.126
But I mean, it couldn't, it didn't go any further than getting him admitted.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.793
Now it went to perhaps a little babysitting.

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:28.976
It went to a little encouragement.

00:23:30.498 --> 00:23:39.070
But it didn't, to the best of my knowledge, it never got to an individual professor or anything like that.

00:23:39.927 --> 00:23:41.088
All right, back to Jack Williams.

00:23:41.268 --> 00:23:47.934
Were you aware of his declining health before he has his heart attacks?

00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:48.955
No.

00:23:48.975 --> 00:23:49.636
I wasn't either.

00:23:50.236 --> 00:23:51.037
No.

00:23:51.057 --> 00:23:55.201
And when that happened, to me, it was kind of unexpected.

00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:56.722
Oh, yeah.

00:23:56.742 --> 00:23:57.703
Then we had, let's see.

00:23:57.763 --> 00:23:58.704
And very secretive.

00:23:58.944 --> 00:23:59.224
Right.

00:24:00.165 --> 00:24:01.767
And, let's see, Clyde Freeman.

00:24:02.227 --> 00:24:02.908
Was interim.

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:03.828
The interim.

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:07.892
And then Dr. Miller was appointed.

00:24:08.412 --> 00:24:14.121
Do you remember any particular reaction in the office where you worked of his selection?

00:24:15.183 --> 00:24:16.966
Oh, total surprise.

00:24:18.027 --> 00:24:18.969
Complete surprise.

00:24:19.951 --> 00:24:23.356
It was a selection that had pretty much come out of nowhere.

00:24:23.977 --> 00:24:26.461
And whom did you all think it would be?

00:24:28.084 --> 00:24:30.808
Well, I had heard Jack Williams say,

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:40.719
that he told the academic council, and these are going to be my words, but they're going to be very close, because I was shocked at it at the time.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:53.812
He said that even though he was going to be chancellor and they were going to name a president, that things were going to keep running as they had been, that there wouldn't be any real change as far as deans and department heads saw it.

00:24:54.572 --> 00:24:57.235
He more or less told them that he thought he was going to be Calhoun.

00:24:59.071 --> 00:25:06.362
In the back of my mind at the time, I'm thinking, why would they make a change and keep it the same?

00:25:06.402 --> 00:25:12.251
If they just want to give everybody a promotion, you wouldn't go through this.

00:25:13.793 --> 00:25:17.359
But I don't know.

00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:24.910
There was one that I was hoping it wouldn't be.

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:34.162
Do you remember any particular reaction of your colleagues to the surprise of Dr. Miller's selection?

00:25:34.803 --> 00:25:35.204
Not really.

00:25:36.606 --> 00:25:43.616
Did anything change over in admissions and records with his becoming the president?

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:44.777
No, not really.

00:25:45.418 --> 00:25:48.062
And Prescott the vice president?

00:25:49.004 --> 00:25:54.871
As far as how Admissions and Records ran, from our point of view, really not.

00:25:56.553 --> 00:26:11.009
They, I think they both had confidence in Cooper, and from our point of view, things kept going much the same way.

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:16.716
And in, let's see, in Admissions and Records, Bill Lay was

00:26:17.017 --> 00:26:23.944
Director of Admissions, and Bob Lacy was Registrar, which means the record keeper, the grade keeper.

00:26:24.684 --> 00:26:36.896
And then when I first started there, Bob Logan was Director of Financial Aid, and Austin Curley was Student Counseling, and were part of our little group.

00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:40.739
And they all worked well together, didn't they?

00:26:42.341 --> 00:26:46.585
For the most part, for the most part.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:27:15.542
uh would you be interested at this point in an anecdote about dr williams oh yes yes yes there was a woman who worked in admissions and records who worked there for probably 40 years at the time named caroline mitchell she was the only person on campus literally that i was scared of petrified of her she miss mitchell handled transfer admissions

00:27:17.142 --> 00:27:30.321
There was a young woman who was transferring here who was a friend of the Williams family, who was staying with the Williams, and she had some problem with her transfer for the spring semester.

00:27:31.242 --> 00:27:32.364
She saw Miss Mitchell.

00:27:33.606 --> 00:27:38.693
Miss Mitchell ends up, and the kid ended up saying, well, I don't understand.

00:27:38.713 --> 00:27:40.396
And Miss Mitchell said, of course you don't understand.

00:27:40.736 --> 00:27:44.061
You wouldn't have been admitted at all if you weren't a friend of Jack Williams.

00:27:45.256 --> 00:28:09.424
and uh because the kid's been to see the department or something came back and they you know i don't understand so miss mitchell told him the kid goes home at lunch and reports this about 3 30 that afternoon when dr williams hears about it it's raining it's january it's cold dr williams walks from

00:28:09.877 --> 00:28:13.482
what is now the Jack K. Williams Building, to the Koch Building in the rain.

00:28:14.664 --> 00:28:26.320
He walks into the Koch Building, up the stairs to the second floor, where Miss Mitchell's office was, walked into the room, and her office was a cubicle.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.083
The ceiling didn't go all the way to the top.

00:28:28.683 --> 00:28:33.210
They said that he was dripping off his raincoat, rain dripping.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:39.799
He stood there and he realized that anything he said to her was gonna be heard by probably 20 people who were in the larger area.

00:28:40.302 --> 00:29:01.339
He wheeled around, walked down the stairs, walked into the main office of Admissions and Records, past the counter area, the receptionist, didn't stop at Cooper's secretary's office, walked directly into Ed's office, and proceeded to spend the next hour chewing Ed out about what Caroline had done.

00:29:03.182 --> 00:29:03.863
Finally left.

00:29:05.463 --> 00:29:13.295
Ed told his secretary that night, he said, by noon tomorrow, Caroline or I-1 will not be working here.

00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:18.523
He got in the next morning.

00:29:18.563 --> 00:29:21.968
Ed usually got to the office about by quarter after 8.

00:29:22.409 --> 00:29:24.231
He got in the next morning by about 7.30.

00:29:26.455 --> 00:29:31.943
And Miss Mitchell usually got in about five or ten minutes after 8.

00:29:33.678 --> 00:29:36.962
The phone rang at 10 minutes of 8, and it was Dr. Williams on the phone.

00:29:38.484 --> 00:29:41.088
Ed, I owe you an apology.

00:29:41.729 --> 00:29:44.513
I just really took it out on you yesterday.

00:29:44.693 --> 00:29:48.538
I'd had a bad day and a bad week, and that just hit me wrong.

00:29:48.999 --> 00:29:57.430
Ed, I am so lucky to have good people like you working for me that will let me blow off steam that way, and a good enough friend that can do that.

00:29:57.951 --> 00:29:59.252
Ed, I appreciate what you do.

00:29:59.292 --> 00:30:01.255
You're just doing a wonderful job.

00:30:01.235 --> 00:30:07.041
And they were both still employed by noon.

00:30:07.782 --> 00:30:13.288
Now the sad part about it is I'm not sure anyone told Miss Mitchell anything about it.

00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:15.530
I bet you're correct.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.073
Because Ed was about half scared of her too.

00:30:19.254 --> 00:30:25.280
Because to me as a faculty member and then as a bureaucrat, she was a very intimidating person.

00:30:25.861 --> 00:30:30.786
I always thought she gave very definite yes or no answers.

00:30:31.238 --> 00:30:35.604
And that answer was, once she gave it, that was it.

00:30:36.185 --> 00:30:36.866
It was not good.

00:30:37.607 --> 00:30:48.161
Now, I learned not long ago, and I hope this is not at all inappropriate for this recording, about her two almost marriages.

00:30:49.443 --> 00:30:50.504
I only knew of one.

00:30:51.986 --> 00:30:58.495
Her first husband-to-be was killed in World War II on the Western Front.

00:30:59.723 --> 00:31:03.488
wedding dresses, date, and everything, they'd already set tentative.

00:31:04.569 --> 00:31:17.045
Her second, some years later, after the war, her husband-to-be has a heart attack on Thursday before the wedding day, Saturday, and dies the morning of the wedding day.

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:18.707
Oh, I'd never heard that.

00:31:19.108 --> 00:31:27.098
And that the recent auction of her furnishings and all, that Brooks Cofer, the lawyer,

00:31:27.972 --> 00:31:32.579
she had directed him to dispose of the two wedding dresses.

00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:34.562
She didn't want those sold or given to anybody.

00:31:34.983 --> 00:31:36.445
He was to destroy those.

00:31:38.268 --> 00:31:44.778
And that the, I believe in the second, the wedding, she had the wedding rings even.

00:31:46.781 --> 00:31:51.128
And in her attic and so forth.
