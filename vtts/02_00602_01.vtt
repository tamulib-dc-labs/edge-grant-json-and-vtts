00:09.127 --> 00:12.913
My God is the Lord. He's the wayward man. The 
shelter in the time of dawn. He's the lily of the

00:20.125 --> 00:24.052
valley. And he is the friend of peace. When they

00:29.191 --> 00:38.281
put old John in the kettle of water, he's a screw and 
a falling tree. My God is a rock in the weary land,

00:38.301 --> 00:47.751
the weary land, in the weary land. My God is a rock in 
the weary

00:47.771 --> 00:55.840
land, a killer in the time of dawn. My God died on 
Calvary, then I know

00:55.820 --> 01:25.219
he's

00:55.820 --> 01:25.219
a rockin' too.

01:25.199 --> 01:31.386
Where in land, where in land, where in land, my 
heart is a-rockin'. Where in land, where in land,

01:31.406 --> 01:32.748
where in land, my heart is a-rockin'. Where in 
land, where in land, where in land, my heart is

01:32.768 --> 01:34.470
a-rockin'. Where in land, where in land, where in 
land, my heart is a-rockin'. Where in land, where

01:37.073 --> 01:38.435

Where in land, where in land, where in land, my

01:38.455 --> 01:39.796
heart is a-rockin'. Where in land, where in land,

01:47.045 --> 01:48.527
Where in land, where in land, where in land, my 
heart is a-rockin'. Where in land, When they put

01:49.060 --> 01:57.070
old John in to kill the boy, Jesus grew the barley 
green. My God is the rock in this weary land, in this

01:57.211 --> 02:06.523
weary land, in this weary land. My God is the rock in 
this weary land, the killer in the time of the home.

02:15.284 --> 02:18.809
Soften, let me tell you about the chapel of four. 
The Lord God filled it all among the four. Soften,

02:23.957 --> 02:27.382
let me tell you about the chapel of five. The Lord 
God called those dead alive. Soften, let me tell

02:32.249 --> 02:35.554
you about the chapel of six. He's ready to use the 
love and heal his days. And I know he's a rock in the

02:39.862 --> 02:44.709
weary land. Weary land in the weary land. My God is a 
rock in the weary land. Sure in his time

02:54.002 --> 02:57.827
of storm. Stop and let me tell you right to chapter 
seven. The Lord's going to lead you anywhere to

03:01.492 --> 03:05.237
heaven. Stop and let me tell you about the chapel of 
10. I see you standing at the golden gate. Stop and

03:13.970 --> 03:17.377
let me tell you about the chapel of 9. The Lord's 
gonna turn that water to wine. Stop and let me tell

03:22.088 --> 03:25.555
you about the chapel of 10. John said he's coming in 
the world again And I know he's a-rockin' where

03:25.788 --> 03:51.576

he's a-rockin' where he lands Sure in the time of

03:25.788 --> 03:51.576
storm Here's the lily of the valley Here's a virgin 
morning song. When they put on that lion dance,

03:56.077 --> 04:04.905
Jesus loves the lion's jaw. And I know he's a rock in 
the way of the land, way of the land, and the way of

04:05.046 --> 04:13.133
the land. And I know he's a rock in the way of the 
land, shelter in the time of storm.

04:36.038 --> 04:38.561
342, A1, 2, and 3. Lord, give the

04:38.641 --> 04:51.656
whole earth my grace to see. Tell them he that 
trusts my word shall be saved, but he that won't

04:52.356 --> 04:58.564
believe it shall be damned. I make his great 
commission, so that he is preached my gospel

04:58.804 --> 05:04.290
through by all the world. that you can do to all the 
wonder I will do. You must teach all nations my

05:07.862 --> 05:16.858
command, I am, and you must tell them all, 
children, that I think that's enough I have. Okay.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.242
Okay.

05:41.767 --> 05:44.490
Let me come in. Ice the window and open the door. Let 
me come in. Yeah, let me come in. Oh, let me come in.

05:56.765 --> 05:59.548
Ice the window and open the door. Let me come in. 
Ice, little baby, don't you cry. Mother and father

06:03.673 --> 06:06.036
are born to die. I surrender, surrender, 
surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender,

06:06.337 --> 06:14.730
surrender, come in. I surrender and open the door 
and let me come in. I

06:20.459 --> 06:29.454
can't see much. Born in 1844. Huh? My name is 
Wallace Quarterman, in and through the state of

06:33.252 --> 06:37.407
Georgia.

07:01.366 --> 07:11.379
The morning I was shooting breakfast in the house,

07:01.366 --> 07:11.379
and the big gun shot to portray us. The big gun shot, 
so I buy a kind of breakfast in the house. The

07:16.586 --> 07:20.411
overseer asked me, what is that if that is thunder? 
I tell him, I don't know. I know what the answer is.

07:25.177 --> 07:28.622
And so he shot three times, and he commenced to 
shoot. until the plate commenced to rattle on the

07:29.176 --> 07:33.140
table. And he called me and told me to run down in the 
field and tell Peter to turn the people loose that

07:33.160 --> 07:43.271
the Yankees come. And so I run down in the field and 
hooped and hollered at him, Peter, and told him,

07:43.291 --> 07:53.382
Mr. Giggo said turn the people loose because the 
Yankees come. Who was Peter? The driver. And so he

07:55.664 --> 07:58.187
said that, uh, Wallace was lying when he said so. 
When he said so, then the Yankee beat to the land and

08:02.076 --> 08:06.302
they drowned. You understand, way down south, 
getting mighty poor. Kids, they used to drink

08:09.808 --> 08:12.692
coffee, but now they're drinking rye. They said, 
let's raise a uniband, make the rebel understand

08:13.233 --> 08:19.702
to leave our land for the sake of Uncle Sam. Way down 
south, getting mighty poor, shut out the wildcat

08:20.463 --> 08:25.250
and see the rebel run. I ain't gonna end up with them 
team again. I've been over all of them. Yes. And

08:33.362 --> 08:36.326
that, the people then throw where they go then. 
They throw where they go, and they call we all up,

08:37.388 --> 08:47.344
you know, and give you all freedom, because we are 
this much as free as them. Now you understand. But

08:49.688 --> 08:53.053
the Yankee thing must go back to the South to help 
me. Well, they didn't. Of course, there was so much

08:54.175 --> 08:55.697
doubt. And thinking the way, they would have done 
more. But there's so much doubt in the way. They

09:02.638 --> 09:06.584
couldn't because the colored people should have 
been poor. And some white people should have been

09:06.604 --> 09:09.427
poor too. You understand? And the reddish, that's 
them. That's me. I satisfy so far what the Lord has

09:15.295 --> 09:20.241
done for me. I come through. So all this has been up 
and down through the militia. Well, tell me about

09:25.715 --> 09:29.099
how they went to Hawkinsville and drove the sword 
down in the ground. He told them. They know you.

09:40.373 --> 09:42.296
342B.

09:51.647 --> 09:53.089
After they said you can go free, Then what did you 
do? Did you run on off the plantation that day? Did

09:55.971 --> 09:58.715
you leave the plantation that day after they told 
you to go free? Well, the mortars promised to give

09:58.955 --> 10:04.822
me $40 a month in rent. Well, lots of the boys said 
they ain't want it. They'd rather go free, you

10:08.987 --> 10:10.629
know. Well, of course, by I have built, you 
understand, I get along with them, you know. Eat

10:16.857 --> 10:18.599
right out the big pot, you know. And after they sold 
down sword down, they just make them sword down and

10:23.849 --> 10:31.097
they just get on the sword and squash them down. You 
go in Hawkinsville and you see all the swords down

10:31.197 --> 10:35.783
now in the ground. And after the sword was down, 
there's tension and then south tension. And after

10:41.889 --> 10:46.855
the south tension, then they play. Yes, play the 
one foot one way, one foot the other way, one foot

10:46.875 --> 10:52.962
all the way around. What about

10:53.262 --> 11:18.438
afterwards,

10:53.262 --> 11:18.438
you

10:53.262 --> 11:18.438
know, when the Scottish people had the jail and 
everything? Tell us about that. Yeah, that's me.

11:20.601 --> 11:22.223
Everything's been in me hands. But they couldn't 
control the colored people. They do so much

11:26.295 --> 11:34.206
mischief and tell me after going back to the white 
people, we had education. You know, when a man

11:34.726 --> 11:38.511
ain't got no education, he ain't got no thing. All 
we tried to show them, they wouldn't take this,

11:38.531 --> 11:43.899
kill one another and join us. So we had to nominate 
Democrats over the head. They didn't like it. Many

11:48.700 --> 11:54.129
got killed by nominating the Democrats, but we 
couldn't help it to stop them so much killing. You

11:54.169 --> 11:54.950
understand? So we nominated the Democrats and we 
had a big time from that till now. The time ain't

12:01.401 --> 12:05.308
bad, because it's been then. Because a man thinks 
nothing of killing a man and taking a drink of

12:05.328 --> 12:09.675
water. But since we nominate the Democrats, we 
have more insurance, you understand? The law come

12:14.389 --> 12:18.494
in possession then, you know, they wouldn't hear 
it, the colored people. Told, mama, told. Yes,

12:21.537 --> 12:23.659
that's the way they come in possession. But we had 
our own lawyers, judges and everything, where

12:24.099 --> 12:32.948
they just would run everything in the dust, you 
know, kill everything, couldn't stand it. Well,

12:33.008 --> 12:34.930
did you ever have an office? Did you ever hold an 
office? I would want an office. Oh, yeah. Now, man,

12:39.777 --> 12:46.326
I wouldn't want an office for an officer, an unjust 
kind of thing. You understand? You've got to go and

12:47.488 --> 12:50.572
please that fellow, you know. You've got to stop 
doing what God tells you and go and please that

12:50.872 --> 12:54.437
fellow. And the right way will you rap out. What's 
becoming your old master? Old master? He died in

13:00.065 --> 13:02.268
the Yadda fever. He was a nice man to me. I wouldn't 
take anything from him. What was his name? Colonel

13:08.396 --> 13:09.598
Fedvary. Fred Berry. Yes, he was a kind of. I 
wouldn't take anything, but me and him was just

13:13.582 --> 13:17.947
like one, you know. Yes. Yes, ma'am. Well, where 
was his plantation? His plantation on Savannah

13:20.910 --> 13:25.075
River. You know, Killeby Island. Mm-hmm. You 
know, Chatham County, you know, Savannah. Yes. On

13:30.662 --> 13:33.705
Killeby Island. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes. I wouldn't 
take nothing from him. Well, did the white folks

13:37.210 --> 13:39.332
like his willingness? And you all were in power? 
Oh, they liked me. They would like me all the way,

13:42.811 --> 13:45.714
because I would text them, you know. I would text 
them, I would hold it. I would hold it, yanking

13:48.917 --> 13:53.543
myself, and then destroy them, you know. You see, I 
just didn't understand how to speak, you know.

13:56.946 --> 13:58.308
Tell another, you know. I see a man going to do a 
wrong thing, I'd show something. I'd stop him.

14:03.013 --> 14:09.100
Well, did the white people, did your mouth and all 
them like to see the Negroes be the judge in the jail

14:03.013 --> 14:09.100
and everything? No, you see, according to law, you 
know. You don't mind you be that way if you know what

14:12.785 --> 14:17.053
you're doing. Don't you see? Yeah. You see, they 
don't know what they're doing. And they prove that

14:22.925 --> 14:23.967
they

14:42.172 --> 14:49.665
This is AFS recording number 9,990

14:42.172 --> 14:49.665
of original LWO number 1500. This is reel number 
three of three.

15:51.511 --> 15:52.712
Talk to who? Well, just tell me what your name is.

15:57.818 --> 15:59.941
My name is Fountain Hughes.

16:02.704 --> 16:04.806
I was born in Charlottesville, Virginia.

16:07.389 --> 16:09.972
My grandfather belonged to Thomas Jefferson. My 
grandfather was 115 years old when he died. And now

16:16.540 --> 16:18.762
I am 101 years old. That's enough.

16:25.396 --> 16:27.559
But what she made, I don't know. I never

16:27.579 --> 16:32.085
asked her. You just go ahead and talk away there. 
You don't mind, do you, Uncle Sam? No. And when now

16:37.192 --> 16:44.441
your husband and you both are young, you all try to 
live like young people ought to live. Don't want

16:44.541 --> 16:47.866
everything somebody else has got. Whatever you 
get, it is human. Be satisfied. And don't spend

16:51.070 --> 16:53.293
your money until you get it. So many people get in 
debt. Well, oh, it's so cheap and I bought it. You

17:00.338 --> 17:04.444
spend your money before you get it because you're 
going in debt for what you want. When you want

17:05.306 --> 17:10.554
something, wait until you get the money and pay for 
it cash. That's what I've done. If I wanted

17:12.898 --> 17:17.945
anything, I'd wait until I got the money and I paid 
for it cash. I never bought nothing on time in my

17:18.246 --> 17:20.850
life. Now, plenty of people, if they want a suit of 
clothes, they go to work and they buy them on time.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.682
Well, they say it was cheap. If you got the money, 
you can buy them cheaper. They want something for

17:31.607 --> 17:37.473
waiting on you until you get ready to pay them. And 
if you got the money, you can go where you choose and

17:38.273 --> 17:41.297
buy it when you want it. See? Don't buy it because 
somebody else go down and run a debt and run a bill or

17:42.698 --> 17:47.043
I'm going to run it too. Don't do that. I never done 
it. Now, I'm 100 years old, and I don't owe nobody

17:49.990 --> 17:52.714
five cents. I ain't got no money either. I'm just as 
happy as somebody that's got a million. Nothing

18:03.188 --> 18:04.310
worries me. My head ain't even white. Nothing in 
the world worries me. I can sit here in this house

18:09.057 --> 18:12.521
till night. Nobody can come and say, Mr. Hughes, 
you owe me a quarter, you owe me a dollar, you owe me

18:12.542 --> 18:17.228
five cents. No, you can't. I don't owe you nothing. 
Why? I never made no bills in my life. And I'm

18:22.171 --> 18:23.572
living, too. And I'm 100 years old. And if you take 
my advice today, you'll never make a bill. Of

18:30.500 --> 18:32.983
course, what you want, give me money to pay in cash. 
And then the rest of the money is yours. But here on

18:36.407 --> 18:41.794
the bill, they... Well, so much and so much, and you 
don't have to pay. Nothing down. When you come to

18:44.577 --> 18:46.980
pay, it's all... You have to pay no more. But 
they'll charge you more. They're getting

18:51.762 --> 18:53.904
something out of you, else they wouldn't trust 
you. But I can't just say what they're getting. But

18:56.887 --> 19:00.771
they're getting something out of you, else they 
wouldn't want your credit. Now, I tell you that.

19:02.012 --> 19:13.102
Anybody that trusts you for $2 or half a count with 
them by the month or by the week, store count or any

19:02.012 --> 19:13.102
count, they're getting something out of you. Else 
they don't want to accommodate you that much to

19:13.122 --> 19:16.545
trust you. Now, if I want, of course, I ain't got no 
clothes, but if I want some clothes, if I ain't got

19:17.656 --> 19:29.107
no money, I'm going to wait until I get the money to 
buy them. I'm not going to say, of course, I can get

19:29.127 --> 19:31.609
them on the church. I go down and get them. I got to 
pay a dollar more anyhow. You're either going to

19:35.253 --> 19:39.117
charge them or what you said, taxes or so much. But 
if I got the money to pay cash, I pay the taxes and all

19:39.137 --> 19:44.862
down cash, then it's all done with. So many colored 
people, head over heels in debt. Trust me, trust

19:50.336 --> 19:52.899
me. I get it on time. So I want a set of furniture. But 
I don't pay down so much and rest on time. You don't

19:59.487 --> 20:01.249
pay it for them then. When you pay down so much, you 
may charge $50, $100 for a set, and you pay down $25

20:02.050 --> 20:07.897
cash. You don't pay it for them. That's all it was 
worth, $25. Now I'm $75 in debt now. Of course, I

20:16.234 --> 20:18.157
have to pay $100, that's it. And it's only worth 
about $25. But you bind on time. But people ain't

20:24.465 --> 20:26.187
got sense enough to know it. But when you get old 
like I am, you come in and you think, well, I have

20:27.889 --> 20:33.556
done wrong. I should have kept my money until I 
wanted this thing, and when I wanted it, I take my

20:39.365 --> 20:46.933
money and go cash cash, or else I do without it. 
Suppose you want a new dress. You say, well, I buy

20:50.216 --> 20:58.465
it, but

20:50.216 --> 20:58.465
I don't need it. But I can get it on time. Well, let's 
go down to the store today and get something on

21:02.870 --> 21:05.092
time. Why don't you go down and get a dress on time, 
something else, and let him I won't have to sell

21:08.221 --> 21:10.684
that to you on time. You don't have to pay nothing 
down. But there's a payday coming. And when that

21:14.909 --> 21:17.633
payday comes, they want you to come pay them. If you 
don't, they can't get no more. Well, if you never do

21:21.238 --> 21:26.845
that, if you don't start it, you will never end it. I 
never did buy nothing on time. I must tell you on

21:29.067 --> 21:35.055
this, I'm sitting right here now today, and if it's 
the last word I've got to tell you, I never even much

21:35.390 --> 21:39.554
as tried to buy a shirt on time. And plenty of people 
go to work, down to the store and buy $3 and $4 for a

21:40.194 --> 21:49.122
shirt, $2, $3, $7, $8 for a pair of pants. Of course, 
they get them on time. I don't know, no, no. I say,

21:53.646 --> 21:56.149
I've got, I buy some for $5. What I got to $5, I'll pay 
for it. I'm done with that. You talk about how old

22:00.112 --> 22:02.154
you are, Uncle Fountain. How far back do you 
remember? I

22:05.647 --> 22:16.303
remember, well, I tell you, things come to me in 
spells, you know. I remember things more when I'm

22:16.323 --> 22:22.091
laying down than I do when I'm standing, when I'm 
walking around. Now, in my boy days,

22:23.213 --> 22:32.987
boys lived quite different from the way they live 
now. But boys wasn't as mean as they are now either.

22:38.802 --> 22:44.110
Boys lived to,

22:38.802 --> 22:44.110
they had a good time. The masters didn't treat them 
bad. And they were always satisfied. They never

22:50.761 --> 22:53.946
wore no shoes until they were 12 or 13 years old. Now 
people put on shoes on babies, you know, when

22:54.483 --> 23:00.069
they're two years old, when they're a month old, I 
don't know. Put shoes on babies just as soon as you

23:00.089 --> 23:03.613
see them out in the street, they got shoes on. I told 
a woman the other day, I said, I never had no shoes

23:03.633 --> 23:08.779
until I was 13 years old. She said, well, but you 
bruised your feet all up and stumped your toes. I

23:13.124 --> 23:16.207
said, yes, many times I've stumped my toes and 
blood run out of them. That didn't make them buy me

23:17.208 --> 23:18.830
no shoes. And I've been... Oh...

23:24.453 --> 23:30.400
Oh, you wore a dress like a woman until I was 10, 12, 
13 years old. You wore a dress, Philip? Yes, I

23:31.621 --> 23:35.586
didn't wear no pants because I didn't make boys' 
pants. Boys wore dresses. Now the women's wearing

23:37.629 --> 23:43.556
the dresses and the boys are going with the...

23:43.596 --> 23:47.060
The women's wearing the pants now and the boys are 
wearing the dresses. Who did you work for, Uncle

23:48.541 --> 23:50.183
Tom? Who did I work for? Yeah. You mean when I was a 
slave? Yeah, when you were a slave. Who did you work

23:55.544 --> 23:56.405
for? Well, I belonged to Burnish when I was a slave. 
My mother belonged to Burnish.

24:07.136 --> 24:16.506
But we was all slave children. Soon after, when we 
found out that we were free, Well, then we was bound

24:21.507 --> 24:24.211
out to different people. Thicklin, Andrew, and 
Andrews, and all such people as that. And we'd run

24:30.119 --> 24:32.241
away and wouldn't stay with them. Well, then we'd 
just go and stay wherever we could, lay out all

24:32.261 --> 24:36.687
night, you know, anywhere. We had no home, you 
know. We just turned out like a lot of cattle. You

24:41.574 --> 24:44.017
know how they turn cattle out in the pasture? Well, 
after freedom, you know, colored people didn't

24:44.818 --> 24:47.682
have nothing. Colored people didn't have no beds 
when they were slaves. People slept on the floor.

24:52.538 --> 24:53.960
Padded here and padded there. Just like a lot of 
wild people, we didn't know nothing. Didn't lie

25:02.348 --> 25:05.571
looking no book. And there were some pre-born 
colored people where they had little education.

25:10.136 --> 25:12.698
But there were very few of them where we was. And we 
all had a, what you call, I might call it now, jail

25:22.004 --> 25:25.508
sentence, just the same as we were in jail. Now, I 
couldn't go from here across the street, or I

25:25.989 --> 25:36.301
couldn't go to nobody's house without having a 
note or something from my master. And if I had that

25:37.722 --> 25:46.833
pass, that was what we called a pass, if I had that 
pass, I could go wherever he sent me, and I'd have to

25:37.722 --> 25:46.833
be back. Whoever he sent me to, they'd give me 
another pass, And I'd bring that back so as to show

25:50.827 --> 25:53.851
how long I'd been gone. We couldn't go out and stay 
an hour or two hours or something like that. They'd

25:58.196 --> 26:03.142
send you, you know, say, for instance, I'd go out to 
the shirtless place, I'd have to walk. And I'd have

26:04.143 --> 26:06.486
to be back maybe an hour. Maybe they'd give me an 
hour. I don't know just how long they'd give me. But

26:09.469 --> 26:14.535
they'd give me a note so there wasn't nobody in the 
field with me to tell who I belonged to. And when I

26:14.555 --> 26:15.957
come back, I'd carry it to my master and give that to 
him. That'd be all right. But I couldn't just walk

26:20.844 --> 26:25.408
away like the people just now, you know. We were 
slaves. We belonged to people. They'd sell us,

26:28.131 --> 26:42.264
like they sell horses and cows and hogs and all like 
that, have an auction bench and put you up on the

26:28.131 --> 26:42.264
bench and beat on you the same as you're beating on 
cattle, you know. Was that in Charlotte that you

26:42.645 --> 26:44.447
were a slave? Was that in Charlotte? Or 
Charlottesville. That isn't Charlottesville.

26:48.418 --> 26:49.199
Charlottesville, Virginia. They'd sell to 
women, sell to men. And then if they had any bad

26:52.963 --> 26:58.849
ones, they'd sell them to the nigger traders, what 
they called the nigger traders. And they'd ship

26:58.869 --> 27:00.070
them down south. They'd sell them down south. But 
otherwise, if you were a good person, they

27:03.874 --> 27:09.620
wouldn't sell you. But if you were bad, meaning 
they didn't want to beat you and knock you around,

27:15.573 --> 27:18.796
They'd sell you to what's called a nigger trader. 
They'd have a regular... I was sold every month,

27:20.738 --> 27:23.301
you know, at the courthouse. And then they'd sell 
you, maybe $200, $100, $500.

27:33.030 --> 27:34.912
Were you ever sold from one person to another? Were 
you ever sold? No, I never was sold. You always

27:38.876 --> 27:41.519
stayed with the same person? I was too young to 
sell. Oh, I see. See, I wasn't old enough during the

27:44.311 --> 27:48.637
war to sell, during the army. And my father got 
killed in the army, you know, so it left us small

27:48.817 --> 28:00.414
children just to live on whatever people choose to 
give us. I would bind out for a dollar a month, and my

28:01.455 --> 28:07.784
mother used to collect the money. Children 
couldn't spend money when I come along. In fact,

28:14.450 --> 28:18.915
When I come along, young men couldn't spend no 
money until they were 21 years old. And then you're

28:19.956 --> 28:22.258
21, well, then you could spend your money. But if 
you wasn't 21, you couldn't spend no money. I

28:27.143 --> 28:30.286
couldn't spend 10 cents if somebody gave it to me. 
Of course, they'd think, well, you might have

28:30.306 --> 28:33.369
stole it. We all come along, you might say, we had to 
give an account of what you'd done. You couldn't

28:39.516 --> 28:43.680
just do things and walk off and say, I didn't do it. 
We'd have to give an account of it. Now, after we got

28:48.416 --> 28:56.366
freed and they turned us out like cattle, we didn't 
have nowhere to go. We didn't have nobody to boss

28:57.207 --> 29:00.350
us. And we didn't know nothing. There wasn't no 
school. And when they started the little school,

29:06.598 --> 29:12.064
the people that were slaves, many of them couldn't 
go to school. Except they had a father and a mother.

29:15.819 --> 29:18.862
And my father was dead and my mother was living. But 
she had three, four other little children. She had

29:21.426 --> 29:27.293
to put them all to work to help take care of the 
others. So we had what you call worse than dogs have

29:28.134 --> 29:34.922
got it now. Dogs have got it now better than we had it 
when we come along. I know, I remember one night I

29:41.255 --> 29:48.944
was out after I was free and I didn't have nowhere to 
go. I didn't have nowhere to sleep. I didn't know

29:50.346 --> 29:51.487
what to do. My brother and I was together. So we knew 
a man that had a living stable there. And we crept in

29:58.856 --> 30:06.224
that yard and got in one of the hacks like an 
automobile and slept in that hack all night long.

30:07.346 --> 30:08.427
So next morning, we could get out and go where we 
belonged. But we were afraid to go at night because

30:11.305 --> 30:15.110
we didn't know where to go and didn't know what time 
to go. But we had got away from there and we were

30:15.711 --> 30:18.135
afraid to go back. So we kept sleeping in that thing 
all night until the next morning and we got back

30:18.695 --> 30:26.447
where we belonged before the people got up. As soon 
as the day commenced to break, we got up and

30:26.887 --> 30:31.574
commenced to go where we belonged. But we never 
done that but the one time. After that, we... If it

30:36.976 --> 30:42.022
was away, we'd try to get back before night come. 
And that was on a Sunday, too, that we done that.

30:46.127 --> 30:51.073
Now, when we were slaves, we couldn't do that, see? 
And if we got free, we didn't know nothing to do. My

30:55.097 --> 30:59.683
mother, she hunted places and bound us out for a 
dollar a month. We stayed there maybe a couple of

31:00.904 --> 31:03.287
years. She'd come over and collect the money every 
month. And a dollar...
