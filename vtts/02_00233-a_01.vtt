00:02.967 --> 00:04.130
Testing, testing.

00:04.330 --> 00:07.839
Today's date is January 31st, 1986.

00:09.864 --> 00:15.398
This is an interview with Norman Borlaug at Texas A&M University.

00:17.142 --> 00:17.924
This is a test.

00:17.944 --> 00:19.187
This is a test.

00:21.479 --> 00:24.222
This is January 31st, 1986.

00:24.343 --> 00:36.318
It's Terry Anderson and this is tape number 11, which means we're about 16 hours of conversation with Norman Borlaug.

00:36.838 --> 00:42.205
And we're going to start off by talking about another aspect of criticism.

00:42.185 --> 00:48.813
criticism of the Green Revolution and Dr. Borlaug, and that deals with inequality, so let's start with that.

00:49.434 --> 01:09.238
There are those individuals who think that the so-called Green Revolution contributed to making greater inequalities, greater discrepancies between the poor and the rich, so-called.

01:09.826 --> 01:15.055
especially on the food availability front.

01:16.477 --> 01:24.831
I'm not so sure that these inequalities haven't been built into the system since long before recorded time.

01:25.693 --> 01:34.568
As I visualize it, and there's nothing to prove this, but knowing human nature, the strongest tribes

01:35.071 --> 01:47.364
during the hunting's epoch, occupied the best grazing lands where the largest animals were prevalent in the largest numbers.

01:47.384 --> 02:04.521
And the weaker tribes were pushed off into fringe areas, very often more limited in rainfall, consequently more restricted in vegetative growth, and this in turn led to

02:04.889 --> 02:09.298
these sites being occupied mostly by smaller animals.

02:10.120 --> 02:20.822
The result was that those who occupied these less favorable ecosystems had to rely on smaller animals

02:21.072 --> 02:22.414
for their food supply.

02:22.494 --> 02:31.407
Of course, all of them were supplementing it at a certain point in time with the collection of wild grains and nuts and fruits and roots.

02:31.427 --> 02:45.628
But be that so, it was probably true for both those occupying the favored ecosystems, more privileged in rainfall, consequently in

02:46.469 --> 02:55.764
grass and forage, therefore a higher carrying capacity for the larger animals, a more privileged hunting site.

02:55.784 --> 02:59.750
And the less privileged were pushed into more marginal areas.

03:00.211 --> 03:02.875
Having to rely on smaller animals,

03:03.327 --> 03:13.363
Meaning that the struggle to get enough of them to feed their peoples was probably disproportionate to those who occupied their sites.

03:13.383 --> 03:15.046
There's nothing to prove this.

03:15.106 --> 03:21.336
It goes back before written history.

03:21.822 --> 03:29.674
human beings, and not only human beings, other species of animals, this is almost certainly to have been the case.

03:30.395 --> 03:44.657
So that I think it's quite unjust to say that we have, those of us who have been involved in

03:45.886 --> 03:55.203
evolving this so-called green revolution have been responsible for provoking this worsening situation.

03:55.844 --> 04:08.147
My own feeling has existed for a long time, but to think that a technological change which has greatly increased the world food production in the last 15, 20, 25 years,

04:08.633 --> 04:22.346
could also alone have corrected all of the social injustices that preceded probably by quite a bit Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

04:22.386 --> 04:23.467
This isn't to be.

04:24.508 --> 04:28.152
But we need to remember that there are two aspects of this problem.

04:28.172 --> 04:29.893
One is to produce enough food.

04:29.913 --> 04:32.356
The second is to distribute it equitably.

04:32.436 --> 04:34.658
Now the transfer

04:34.975 --> 04:58.339
of the benefits can be achieved in various ways in an organized society through tax transfers, food stamps, food for work, a whole series of possibilities depending on social programs, depending on the stage of evolution of society.

04:58.999 --> 04:59.740
And that's a must.

05:00.361 --> 05:02.603
But that's on a different front.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.480
And then the biological agricultural front.

05:06.580 --> 05:10.563
That doesn't mean that I haven't been aware of the need for this.

05:10.584 --> 05:23.336
And I've pushed for it time and again for trying to prevent as far as possible these with little purchasing power being left behind.

05:23.636 --> 05:26.259
And that's a constant struggle.

05:26.279 --> 05:26.719
Okay.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.683
Now I have a couple things to say about that.

05:31.388 --> 05:44.554
This seems in a sense, as an American historian I can say this, it seems in a sense that what you're talking about, the fact that there is always inequality in your basis, seems like social Darwinism.

05:45.293 --> 05:46.835
Well, how would you respond to that?

05:46.895 --> 05:59.351
The idea of there are fitter groups of people and those fitter groups would naturally rise to the top and get the best areas and then become the most productive type people.

06:00.092 --> 06:11.887
Well, first, as a geneticist, let me say that I think that this genetic variation transcends groups.

06:12.848 --> 06:14.170
I think within any group

06:15.044 --> 06:22.412
The slogan that we're all born equal biologically makes no sense at all.

06:22.873 --> 06:24.454
We're all born different.

06:25.756 --> 06:45.017
And that is in itself one of the great buffering actions that has permitted mankind to evolve both biologically, sociologically and politically.

06:46.533 --> 06:49.017
There's another social aspect of this.

06:49.037 --> 06:54.485
Under our Constitution, we are all equal under the law.

06:54.925 --> 06:57.149
Equal rights, equal opportunities.

06:57.649 --> 07:02.116
But that doesn't mean we're all born the same, which is implied.

07:02.517 --> 07:06.943
That we're all born the same genetically.

07:06.963 --> 07:09.187
Some by a straight stroke of luck.

07:09.948 --> 07:14.194
How the egg and sperm came together.

07:15.254 --> 07:22.465
Might have been the individual, myself included, might have been any one of a million other brothers or sisters.

07:23.506 --> 07:24.909
I just happen to be what I am.

07:25.790 --> 07:32.420
I've got ten fingers and ten toes and have had good health.

07:32.440 --> 07:41.093
I've taken care of myself and I've tried to develop, I think, very

07:41.714 --> 07:48.381
average intellect and mental capacity within the limits that I drew these cards.

07:49.242 --> 07:49.963
That's a question.

07:50.964 --> 08:04.018
Whenever I talk about potential, whether it's in plants or whether it's in animals or whether it's in human beings, I look at it this way.

08:04.038 --> 08:10.725
The limits of potential are set in that second.

08:12.443 --> 08:40.611
fertilization takes place for the individual and we have no control over it but what is done subsequently will determine whether that potential can be expressed or not whether it's latent and will never be expressed because of what happens from a sociological political standpoint let's take the case of

08:42.835 --> 08:47.822
The wheat plant that I've spent most of my time working with.

08:47.842 --> 08:52.369
Those high yielding semi dwarf varieties have a potential.

08:54.011 --> 09:01.282
Let's say the spring wheat types which are about 150, 160 day maturity classes.

09:02.223 --> 09:10.075
When they are grown properly, under favorable environment, they can produce

09:10.797 --> 09:21.588
7 to even 8 tons per hectare, which is roughly 115 to 120 bushels per acre in those 160 days time.

09:23.269 --> 09:25.051
Rarely do you get this happening.

09:25.852 --> 09:38.965
And the reason is that to achieve it, first of all, there are some factors that are beyond the control of human beings through temperatures, whether they go up too soon or don't go up soon enough.

09:39.147 --> 09:43.333
or don't go down soon enough after planting to stimulate the vegetative growth.

09:43.373 --> 09:50.985
And if they go up too soon in the spring when grain is approaching maturity, the grain will likely be shriveled and won't be plump.

09:52.587 --> 09:56.574
So you've got to manipulate all of these factors to permit the expression of that.

09:57.675 --> 10:08.091
You have to restore soil fertility that's been depleted by bad farming practices over decades and sometimes hundreds of years.

10:08.999 --> 10:23.228
You have to use the right dates and rates of planting to get the best expression of that plant's ability to respond to both the improved soil fertility, to utilize the moisture properly,

10:23.731 --> 10:29.499
Then as soon as you manipulate those two, you've got to control the weeds because they become aggressive.

10:29.519 --> 10:41.597
And unless you're careful, they will consume much of the moisture and the fertilizer and will compete with the wheat plant and thereby reduce the yield potential.

10:41.617 --> 10:48.507
Then also there is the limitations imposed by various kinds of diseases in insect pests.

10:48.976 --> 10:56.545
All of these have to be manipulated before that plant can express its true genetic yield potential.

10:56.565 --> 11:06.137
Now to get this technology into commercial production, you have to control also the social economic factors.

11:06.798 --> 11:18.713
In other words, the availability of these inputs at reasonable prices, credit for the farmer to buy it, and a fair price at time of harvest that's not manipulated by the grain merchant.

11:19.368 --> 11:25.436
Now let's take a look at, that's the wheat plant.

11:25.456 --> 11:40.515
About three years ago, the top production of milk was held by, I told them to cut that off, excuse me.

11:41.812 --> 11:59.953
This cow, I think she was in Indiana, she produced something on the order of 6,000 gallons of milk and a full period of lactation.

12:01.855 --> 12:07.161
That's fantastic.

12:07.613 --> 12:11.537
She could never, that was the potential she expressed.

12:12.157 --> 12:20.085
But had she been badly fed, she probably would have produced one-third or one-half as much.

12:23.648 --> 12:29.374
And had she not had proper veterinary care, she might have died from disease.

12:29.714 --> 12:36.220
So again you have this potential and it being expressed or not expressed.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.463
All of these go together, looking at the child.

12:40.945 --> 12:45.930
That child inherits this set of genes from father and mother.

12:48.473 --> 13:04.772
But before that true potential of that youngster can be expressed, first it must have good nutrition, develop a strong body and good health to be able to work effectively.

13:05.123 --> 13:06.585
develop its other talents.

13:07.586 --> 13:12.251
And then the mental intellectual will never develop without proper education.

13:12.972 --> 13:28.870
And that's the sad part of so many youth in the developing world never having had a chance to express their genetic yield potential, either health-wise, physical-wise, or intellectually.

13:28.890 --> 13:33.595
And I've had the satisfaction, I don't know whether we mentioned this in one of the previous interviews,

13:34.182 --> 13:44.575
of picking up a number of young Mexicans who had dropped out of school in the second and third grade.

13:44.875 --> 13:47.819
We got them working with us chasing birds.

13:48.119 --> 13:48.720
When was this?

13:49.421 --> 13:50.422
You didn't mention this, no?

13:50.502 --> 13:51.463
No?

13:51.483 --> 13:53.546
Well, and I think this is worth mentioning.

13:53.566 --> 13:57.591
We talked about Little League and we didn't talk about this, no.

13:58.178 --> 14:10.070
Well, then let me just take one or two cases to illustrate these unpolished gems, jewels, that never had a chance to express their potential.

14:10.090 --> 14:26.667
One of those people is today Dr. Arturo Hernandez, who received his PhD in genetics and plant breeding from the University of Minnesota about three years ago.

14:27.642 --> 14:48.030
Way back in the middle 50s, early 50s, he was a little ragged boy near one of our research stations in La Piedad, Michoacan, Mexico, looking for a job.

14:48.517 --> 15:01.290
We put him on scaring birds during the time the grain was rotting, running around cracking a whip, throwing mud clots at the birds to keep them out of the experimental plots.

15:03.292 --> 15:12.201
He had bright shiny eyes and he could tell he was very intelligent and he started to do many other things beyond scaring birds.

15:12.802 --> 15:17.967
During the harvest he would catch on fast.

15:18.605 --> 15:21.569
Our whole team liked him, he worked hard.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.978
We encouraged him, got him back into school.

15:27.759 --> 15:34.068
He finished school at that primary school, at this little village.

15:34.088 --> 15:42.661
And then there was an opportunity to, we were opening another station near Celaya, where there was a secondary school at night.

15:43.763 --> 15:45.405
And so we transferred in there.

15:46.178 --> 15:52.106
And he continued to work with us, went to night school, finished secondary school.

15:52.126 --> 16:01.979
By then he was changing into pretty bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, likable little personality.

16:01.999 --> 16:16.118
I should say that several of us, and it wasn't just me, I would put up a few pesos, but I insisted that my Mexican colleagues would also contribute to

16:16.334 --> 16:26.108
Seeing him through, helping him beyond what he earned, which was pretty meager, through night school.

16:26.932 --> 16:38.690
Eventually he got his high school degree and then he applied to Topingo, but his grades were not good enough because it was an early bad start to get a scholarship.

16:38.710 --> 16:48.265
Topingo is the National College of Agriculture near our headquarters, where El Baton, our summit headquarters is today.

16:48.852 --> 17:03.204
But we made provisions that he worked on Saturdays and Sundays and during vacations with Dr. Eva Yegas in the biochemistry laboratory.

17:03.224 --> 17:07.975
She had taken an interest in him also out in the field.

17:08.917 --> 17:13.801
had been one who had contributed a few pesos all along the way.

17:13.821 --> 17:22.729
And while he was there, it was even more difficult for him to earn enough, and so we continued to put a few pesos together.

17:22.749 --> 17:26.513
And he graduated and got a B.S.

17:26.533 --> 17:32.518
degree, or Ingeniero Agrónomo, we call him in Mexico.

17:32.538 --> 17:37.202
And then he worked with one of our

17:37.807 --> 17:44.965
an ex-weight team man who was the director of extension for several years.

17:45.282 --> 17:51.628
He went back to graduate school, got a master's in Chapingo.

17:51.648 --> 17:52.509
He did very well.

17:54.731 --> 17:59.275
Then we got him a fellowship and he went to the University of Minnesota.

17:59.295 --> 18:03.058
He came back with a PhD about three years ago.

18:03.078 --> 18:07.522
He was a highly intelligent, well-motivated young scientist.

18:07.542 --> 18:13.888
We've got a couple of others that we picked up the same way, that have now received

18:14.037 --> 18:30.579
Bachelor of Science degrees, Master of Science degrees, some of them, and one of them particularly is out teaching now in an undergraduate sort of practical school of agriculture.

18:30.599 --> 18:33.082
He came from the land too, up the hard way.

18:34.063 --> 18:42.795
We picked up quite a few others that are the best technicians that we have on the whole wheat team today, but we identified them

18:43.231 --> 18:48.597
And also this was in the earliest days of the old Rockefeller program.

18:48.617 --> 18:54.443
We didn't quite know how to go about this then, like we did in the case of these that I've just mentioned.

18:55.844 --> 19:02.171
But we did get them back into school in the Finnish primary and sometimes secondary school.

19:02.952 --> 19:10.099
And one of those, Ray's Vega, has been with the wheat program.

19:12.053 --> 19:19.920
since 1947.

19:21.470 --> 19:24.013
He's been with me one way or another this whole time.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.516
And he runs the whole operation.

19:26.536 --> 19:29.700
At one time he was the master technician.

19:29.721 --> 19:30.802
But he's moved beyond that.

19:30.862 --> 19:51.308
He runs the whole experimental station from the standpoint of preparing all the land, fertilizing it, supervising all the plantings, handling all the irrigation, handling all of the whole operation, which is the largest and most complex in the world from the standpoint of backing up the scientific work.

19:51.608 --> 20:00.317
One other who came up through the same route, who's a master at electrician and handling all sorts of gadgets.

20:00.337 --> 20:02.779
He's in Dr. Eva Viegas' laboratory.

20:02.799 --> 20:04.661
He came up through the field the same way.

20:05.502 --> 20:19.877
And he can handle those amino acid analyzers and not only handle their operation, but when they go, when they break down, he's perfectly capable of repairing them.

20:20.296 --> 20:25.783
So you see that there are many unpolished jewels left behind.

20:26.083 --> 20:29.387
And I mentioned this simply to illustrate.

20:29.427 --> 20:30.148
I could go on.

20:30.649 --> 20:45.347
Many of them that we've salvaged, got going on their own way that are vital to the whole research organization, but probably would never have shown this potential had they not been given a hand up at the right time.

20:45.928 --> 20:50.033
And so, when lots of these accusations are

20:50.367 --> 20:55.953
being made that these injustices are worsened.

20:56.494 --> 20:58.396
I say... By the Green Revolution.

20:58.596 --> 21:00.438
By the Green Revolution, this is all nonsense.

21:00.838 --> 21:16.375
These injustices are all around about us and I dare say those who are making these accusations are probably sitting in a very privileged position and never knelt down personally to try to identify some of this

21:16.844 --> 21:22.356
rough talent that's unpolished gyms.

21:22.557 --> 21:27.728
We have them in our low-income societies here in the USA as well.

21:27.908 --> 21:32.338
It's not just in the developing nations.

21:32.723 --> 21:44.663
like to be critical, I say sometimes they should look in their own mirror and they would see maybe that they too are guilty of some of the same things that they accuse others of being guilty of.

21:44.843 --> 21:54.399
We all need to reflect on this and try to, insofar as possible, overcome many of these injustices.

21:54.419 --> 21:56.242
It's not simple.

21:56.262 --> 21:58.005
And then we have to remember

21:58.981 --> 22:03.489
I've been talking about those that had tremendous genetic yield potential.

22:06.073 --> 22:08.638
Also, there's some that got poor cards to begin with.

22:09.219 --> 22:10.882
And you've got a different problem there.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.767
From my standpoint, society

22:14.658 --> 22:17.843
has to make some provision to take care of those.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.386
That's an entirely different path.

22:20.667 --> 22:36.750
And then there's a third category where they have the talent but never have the motivation and that probably very often comes from, again, from their lack of proper home assistance early in life and probably

22:37.540 --> 22:47.593
Many of these instabilities have to do with the whole hormone system that is, again, probably largely inherited.

22:47.613 --> 22:54.361
Okay, well, you feel then that there's always been inequality, and we just discussed it in full.

22:54.401 --> 23:02.451
Let's move now to right after you won the Nobel Prize and the type of work that you were doing throughout the early 1970s.

23:04.507 --> 23:09.055
We've been through India, Pakistan, and Egypt.

23:09.736 --> 23:24.000
Well, even in 1970, there were many who said that this was just a flash in the pan.

23:24.436 --> 23:28.041
it hadn't proven itself.

23:28.062 --> 23:29.043
The Green Revolution.

23:29.083 --> 23:42.844
Yeah, that the yields would, this was due in a large part to better weather, a whole series of things that didn't have anything to do with science and technology.

23:42.864 --> 23:48.132
But, so we continued to work in

23:49.259 --> 23:52.584
India and Pakistan, Turkey, many other countries.

23:52.604 --> 23:55.427
We began to work in many other countries also.

23:56.128 --> 23:57.270
Funded by Rockefeller.

23:58.171 --> 24:05.281
By then, it was the International Center for Mace and Weed Improvement.

24:05.301 --> 24:06.643
CIMIT had come into being.

24:06.823 --> 24:07.063
Okay, right.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.325
CIMIT came into being.

24:09.587 --> 24:11.870
I should point out that... We've talked about the development.

24:11.910 --> 24:18.439
There was a no man's land as far as the Rockefeller Program and CIMIT were concerned.

24:18.672 --> 24:23.736
In that the Rockefeller Mexican program terminated in 1960.

24:26.098 --> 24:37.608
And then I was assigned, there were several of us who were still left in Mexico as consultants to ENIA, the new national institute, which we had helped form, trained most of the people.

24:38.609 --> 24:47.717
And we were funded out of what was called the Inter-American Food Crop Program.

24:48.389 --> 24:55.700
It was kind of a misnomer, because it was more than American.

24:56.401 --> 25:12.304
The first year or two, we were looking around as to what might be done in some of the other Latin American countries, but that was, I believe I mentioned, when I made one trip through the joint sponsorship of Rockefeller Foundation.

25:13.938 --> 25:17.783
to look at these problems, Morocco to India.

25:17.803 --> 25:32.264
And as a result, we started this training program for young scientists from those countries, which really set the stage for transferring these seeds and the interest to the third world countries, these young students.

25:32.284 --> 25:33.686
And you brought it to Mexico, yeah.

25:33.766 --> 25:34.888
We talked about that.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.650
And the development of Senate.

25:36.670 --> 25:40.215
By 64, then on paper,

25:40.904 --> 25:47.932
an agreement was signed to establish the International Mason Center.

25:48.673 --> 25:54.019
But it was 66 before we started to look for staff.

25:55.301 --> 26:04.131
And it was 68 before we really started to make any progress to pick up the right kind of staff.

26:04.151 --> 26:07.755
And so by 70, or shortly after,

26:08.933 --> 26:30.739
We had expanded our staff and I suppose by that time we had some people either posted in Pakistan, India, Turkey, Lebanon,

26:33.048 --> 26:56.440
And in addition, moving out from those places to work in many other countries like Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Argentina, Chile.

26:57.010 --> 26:58.733
and so on.

27:00.416 --> 27:09.854
Much of this time, I used to spend a month here, a month there in many of these countries with our staff.

27:09.874 --> 27:14.563
Anderson, who had been in India during

27:14.881 --> 27:26.732
This period from about 63 to 71 came back to Mexico as my deputy, the late Dr. Glenn Anderson, who was Canadian.

27:26.752 --> 27:33.999
Unusually talented scientist, but also a very good leader.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.020
He knew how to move things.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.222
He had charisma, but he also had courage.

27:38.443 --> 27:44.348
He knew how to work not only with scientists and farmers, but with politicians.

27:45.931 --> 28:00.728
who had been in Pakistan later with the Ford Fund, and later operated out of Beirut in a number of the Near East countries.

28:00.748 --> 28:06.915
He came back to head up all agricultural extension under President of Mexico.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.238
And by then, we had

28:10.754 --> 28:20.546
By 1972, we had a pretty good young staff assembled, many of which are still in the cement program today.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.268
So we continued to work in these countries.

28:22.288 --> 28:35.063
The main emphasis then was twofold, broadening the disease resistance, which had been surprisingly good.

28:35.083 --> 28:38.247
But since wheat is a crop that has at least 30

28:39.610 --> 28:46.217
different diseases that become epidemic under some climatic conditions.

28:46.978 --> 28:50.642
It's a never-ending fight to stay ahead of these.

28:50.682 --> 28:52.424
You can't work on all of them at once.

28:52.504 --> 29:05.398
You have to establish an order of priorities which are the most dangerous in different ecosystems of the world and correct them one by one insofar as possible.

29:05.378 --> 29:09.205
Then there are biological changes going on in the pathogens.

29:09.225 --> 29:12.090
Things that were resistant become susceptible.

29:12.110 --> 29:13.332
It's a never-ending job.

29:14.094 --> 29:30.002
Probably one of the most important things that came into play in the 70s was the strengthening, expansion and strengthening of this whole international network of

29:30.421 --> 29:33.364
wheat nurseries that were sent around the world.

29:33.905 --> 29:36.527
Is this the second of the two-fold scope?

29:36.688 --> 29:41.913
Okay, so one would be increasing disease resistance and the second would be the development of wheat nurseries?

29:42.494 --> 29:48.440
Which permitted the implementation of this broadening of disease resistance.

29:50.142 --> 29:53.625
Because then it permitted several things.

29:53.665 --> 29:56.108
One,

29:57.623 --> 29:59.505
And these are wheat nurseries internationally.

29:59.565 --> 30:04.031
We're talking about all of the countries.

30:04.051 --> 30:05.072
How many do you think there are?

30:05.092 --> 30:05.893
20, 50?

30:07.015 --> 30:10.098
These nurseries, there are several different kinds of nurseries.

30:10.599 --> 30:21.112
One which attempts to measure yield of all of the varieties that are included in the test.

30:22.734 --> 30:25.217
Generally there are 50 varieties.

30:26.648 --> 30:33.758
These are the most important commercial varieties of all of the spring wheat grown regions of the world.

30:33.778 --> 30:39.447
That constitutes probably 15 in number.

30:39.467 --> 30:48.640
And the remaining 35 are new experimental weeds that are incorporated into this nursery.

30:48.620 --> 30:51.449
for evaluation.

30:51.469 --> 30:54.600
They can be submitted by any plant breeder any place in the world.

30:54.780 --> 31:01.262
They simply send 200 grams of seed to simmet and multiply

31:02.508 --> 31:09.381
brush the seed, clean it, disinfect it, and make it up into envelopes of replicated plots.

31:10.263 --> 31:18.880
And these are sent to about 125 different places in the world where they are planted under the conditions of that country.

31:19.720 --> 31:32.558
Some of them under irrigation, some under rain-fed conditions, some where it's under pretty severe drought, stress, other places where there's ample rainfall, different diseases in every place.

31:32.578 --> 31:43.433
And all of these notes are taken, as well as the yield and agronomic data, and they come back to the CIMIT headquarters and they go through a computer and they're summarized.

31:43.413 --> 31:49.444
The data go back to guide anyone who uses it intelligently.

31:49.464 --> 31:58.279
Now, we use this like a Bible or a Koran to plan the next generation of crosses.

31:58.299 --> 32:07.075
We see how these varieties react in different parts of the world, to different diseases, to different climatic conditions.

32:07.055 --> 32:13.904
Whether they're high-yielding or low-yielding, whether they're stable or whether they vary with different environments.

32:13.924 --> 32:17.248
Just think of the information on... Tremendous.

32:18.129 --> 32:18.450
Incredible.

32:18.650 --> 32:24.778
And this had never been done like this before.

32:24.798 --> 32:28.523
It set a pattern which is now being carried out

32:28.958 --> 32:35.745
by the other institutes like the Rice Institute and by the other half of the house in Simmons, by the maize program.

32:35.765 --> 32:38.087
The maize program had never operated this way.

32:38.648 --> 32:41.371
The idea being that maize was different.

32:41.391 --> 32:44.214
It was supposed to be more location specific.

32:44.614 --> 32:48.598
I long since discarded this philosophy.

32:48.618 --> 32:56.907
The difference was when we used this shuttle breeding technique, we were identifying those unusual individuals.

32:57.308 --> 33:17.106
of plants that could grow well under these wide range of latitudes, elevations, temperatures, diseases, which permitted after an adequate test, whole shiploads of seed to be moved halfway around the world.

33:17.305 --> 33:28.301
These techniques are pretty well established on most of the major crops that the international institutes are working with.

33:28.321 --> 33:45.507
The International Rice Research Institute began to use it first, but it's used now by the IGRS Act, the International Center for Crops in the semi-aerotropics, working on sorghum and peanuts.

33:46.094 --> 33:51.561
mill it by the other institutes that are working on different crops.

33:51.581 --> 34:07.982
Now, also we began to find some varieties that were higher yielding or that had better acceptation from the standpoint of grain types that were preferred in certain areas.

34:08.002 --> 34:15.932
But I think the most important thing of all of these international nurseries was the, that it wove

34:16.351 --> 34:24.203
fabric of world fraternity of wheat scientists.

34:24.223 --> 34:28.510
They had this in common and it bound them all together.

34:28.530 --> 34:41.650
Then we began to organize these regional nurseries or regional workshops where we try to bring as many of those young scientists who had

34:41.630 --> 34:47.217
been trained in Mexico at one point in time, or others who had never been to Mexico.

34:47.237 --> 34:55.528
Bring them together, sometimes Cyprus, sometimes Pakistan, sometimes India, or wherever.

34:57.771 --> 35:02.397
And so this has continued up to this day.

35:02.417 --> 35:09.426
We get in problems, bureaucracies frequently.

35:10.368 --> 35:14.733
are pretty inflexible in letting many of the young scientists travel.

35:15.474 --> 35:17.816
The funds are inadequate.

35:17.836 --> 35:28.308
We have tried to find some supplementary funds, but on the other hand, we feel that the government of those countries have to contribute.

35:28.328 --> 35:32.933
Otherwise, it's a free ride and they never really pay attention.

35:32.913 --> 35:38.181
to what those scientists say and the importance of their work.

35:38.361 --> 35:40.644
Government has to support it.

35:40.664 --> 35:48.615
We try to prod and push and convince them of this, but it's a never-ending struggle.

35:48.635 --> 35:51.019
It's not glamorous like building a new dam.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.801
Yeah.

35:52.821 --> 35:54.083
It's not something you can see.

35:54.464 --> 35:56.166
That's right.

35:57.789 --> 36:01.093
Our new monument.

36:01.113 --> 36:01.374
That's right.

36:01.394 --> 36:01.654
That's right.

36:02.562 --> 36:16.445
And so approximately, we've talked about the students before, approximately how many students do you get, or what was the growth pattern from the late 60s when you started?

36:16.725 --> 36:21.413
When I started this in 61, I was alone.

36:22.495 --> 36:24.238
I was the training officer.

36:24.698 --> 36:28.705
And I told them that I could never handle alone more than 67.

36:29.309 --> 36:34.597
a year, which I did for several years, until Simon was born.

36:35.358 --> 36:47.175
Then we started establishing a hands-on training program, not just in genetics and plant breeding and plant pathology, but also in agronomy and soils and even in serial technology.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.260
All of those aspects that are important.

36:50.280 --> 36:57.831
Today, each year, we have about 60

36:59.532 --> 37:01.814
They come from many different countries of the world.

37:01.974 --> 37:05.938
In Wheaton, I'm pretty clearly alone.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.722
In Mace, they have about an equal number.

37:10.603 --> 37:20.293
Those numbers are limited by our physical facilities, especially the cafeteria and housing.

37:21.414 --> 37:25.438
We're getting more library and laboratories

37:26.380 --> 37:44.969
I should say classroom, laboratory space, a new building is now in the process of being built with Japanese funds and that will become, will be inaugurated in September on the 20th anniversary of Singapore.

37:44.989 --> 37:54.143
And then in addition we have a lot of more short courses where people come through.

37:55.034 --> 38:00.883
And how long is your basic wheat course for scientists?

38:00.903 --> 38:01.463
Six months.

38:02.084 --> 38:03.887
Originally it was for a year.

38:03.947 --> 38:06.651
We wanted to give them two generations.

38:06.691 --> 38:13.501
They shuttled down on the coast in winter in northwest Mexico and in the highlands in the summer.

38:13.521 --> 38:24.197
So they would get the feel of handling this massive amount of material, how you had to be organized to handle these millions of rows or plants.

38:24.802 --> 38:27.084
And to do it on schedule.

38:27.665 --> 38:31.449
If you fall behind and plant late, then you get frosted in the next cycle.

38:31.669 --> 38:32.711
You lose the whole thing.

38:33.571 --> 38:38.757
And so it had great advantages in having them through two cycles which was one year.

38:39.618 --> 38:51.771
But then the demands for this type of training was so great that we had to cut it in half to provide opportunities for more people.

38:52.882 --> 38:54.626
That's the way it remains.

38:55.789 --> 39:09.304
In addition, we have, for example, one of the things that's always a limiting factor in the developing countries is the poor management of their agricultural experiment stations.

39:09.385 --> 39:20.220
The experimental error is tremendously great because of poor leveling of land and poor control of weeds and if it's irrigation, poor irrigation practices.

39:20.821 --> 39:32.777
And that means that if you're trying to measure the differences in yielding ability of a number of lines of wheat compared to the old best variety,

39:33.162 --> 39:44.259
You don't know how much of that difference is due to variation in the soil or in the plots and not to the biological genetic difference.

39:44.279 --> 39:53.373
The same way they're poorly managed from the standpoint of the equipment.

39:53.754 --> 40:01.566
So they just don't have the equipment to... And if they get the equipment, it lasts about one-fourth as long as it should because of poor...

40:01.816 --> 40:29.562
maintenance and so we have a top-notch experiment station director John Stewart who now has begun I guess about five years back he runs a couple short courses a year brings in about five or six young superintendents of experiment stations and they are right there on our stations when the land is being prepared when it's being fertilized

40:29.947 --> 40:38.939
When the scientists come to plant, so they have to learn how to, some of those are kind of prima donnas, as you know, some scientists.

40:39.099 --> 40:53.297
How these people have to walk on water, at least in the early stages, until they get to a point where they're mature enough so that they can tell such a scientist, my gosh, he's wrong.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.882
All of this comes out in the wash.

40:56.902 --> 40:59.565
And also the maintenance of the equipment.

41:01.216 --> 41:15.098
the mechanics, how you handle the mechanics, how they're apart to keep that machinery operating, not for its expected lifetime, but even beyond, because we have such limitations in budgets in these countries.

41:15.799 --> 41:22.009
Now, you mentioned that Japan is helping you build a building now.

41:21.989 --> 41:30.720
What other countries have, we're talking about governments now, not foundations, but what other governments have helped you?

41:31.220 --> 41:49.583
Well, of course, the total network of International Agricultural Research Institutes, of which there are 13 now, are financed, there must be about 39 countries, mostly from the Western world, with the exception of Japan.

41:51.875 --> 41:59.263
The budgets a year ago for the total operation of this network was $184 million.

42:04.309 --> 42:20.346
Now that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but if you take a look at it this way, let's say, I'll say $184 million.

42:21.997 --> 42:24.019
For the entire 13 nation.

42:24.560 --> 42:31.928
I'm sure that's not divided equally.

42:33.089 --> 42:33.970
No.

42:34.771 --> 42:36.273
Well, let me put it this way.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.575
I should have calculated this.

42:44.082 --> 42:47.245
If it were a hundred dollars a ton,

42:50.262 --> 42:53.497
A million tons of wheat will pay for all of this.

42:53.839 --> 42:58.922
Of course, wheat's worth more than $100, so it'll be $150.

43:01.855 --> 43:18.801
800,000 tons of wheat, and yet in one country alone, to show you what has happened, the wheat production in India at the beginning of the introduction of the new technology was 11 million tons.

43:18.821 --> 43:24.289
Last year, the harvest in India was 46 million tons.

43:24.970 --> 43:28.656
That increase of 34 million tons

43:29.075 --> 43:39.275
You see, if you multiply this, that was $150 a ton, or even 100, whatever you figure you want to use.

43:39.295 --> 43:42.300
It's a fantastically big return.

43:44.024 --> 43:45.767
All of this was a spin-off.

43:46.861 --> 43:56.172
from the original investment in the Rockfella program on Mexico, starting back in 1943.

43:56.192 --> 44:15.113
Over that period of 1943 to 2016, when that program was completed, the total expenditures by the Rockfella Foundation for program operation for the experiment station

44:16.392 --> 44:26.165
facilities that were developed, a whole series, and the fellowships for training the staff, as I recall, was about $6 million.

44:27.607 --> 44:30.771
The entire thing was only $6 million for 20 years?

44:30.871 --> 44:32.794
$6.1 million for 17 years.

44:33.735 --> 44:34.656
Gee whiz, that's awful.

44:34.676 --> 44:41.225
If you converted that to $1985, that would be the equivalent of $23 million.

44:42.386 --> 44:44.509
And yet, you see, in one

44:45.367 --> 44:48.151
country.

44:48.191 --> 44:53.398
So there was tremendous payoff.

44:53.699 --> 45:07.678
Now this isn't to say that the current budgets aren't contributing to that, but the pattern was set by this original program.
