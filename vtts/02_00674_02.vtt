00:02.495 --> 00:06.859
Nolan Estes was the superintendent of schools in 
Dallas. It was the one that was here in 1970 in

00:06.919 --> 00:13.886
February that made the presentation, our 
graduate student and faculty. And this was,

00:14.647 --> 00:17.610
again, one of these things that Frank Hubert had 
done. He put together a series of seminars for the

00:18.210 --> 00:29.421
graduate students in which all the graduate 
students from throughout the college would

00:18.210 --> 00:29.421
participate, in which they would participate. 
Which, again, wanting to have them be exposed to

00:32.600 --> 00:40.908
named people in the field, as well as having them be 
able to meet those individuals. But it's

00:40.928 --> 00:44.692
interesting how the graduate students reacted to 
that. It was required. So they liked it very well. I

00:48.716 --> 00:55.103
find it very interesting today we have graduate 
students in our department that are asking for

00:48.716 --> 00:55.103
such. If we required it, that's what they would 
like it. That's funny. Do you feel, then, that this

01:01.962 --> 01:07.187
has helped in how this college is viewed by 
outsiders? Because this is so unique, and it's

01:07.227 --> 01:12.091
something that just evolved, and it has only 
happened here. Is that? I don't know as very many

01:13.032 --> 01:28.847
people, even within the college, even know about 
how that has really evolved and how it functions

01:13.032 --> 01:28.847
today, because it does function so much like a 
department.

01:29.941 --> 01:37.130
Just a little aside about how these things can 
benefit and create attitudes and so forth. I

01:38.292 --> 01:49.747
referenced earlier that I was always able to get 
the good faculty to teach, but there was a line item

01:38.292 --> 01:49.747
that I referenced earlier in the Ed Psych budget 
for a vocational guidance type person. After Dr.

01:51.269 --> 01:59.239
Bowman went into other responsibilities and a 
couple people went through that line, one year

01:51.269 --> 01:59.239
that line was not filled by Ed Psych. And here I was 
with a array of courses to teach, and I didn't have a

02:00.299 --> 02:07.367
faculty member to teach that course because I had 
to go to Ed Psych to get it. I had to hire someone on a

02:08.348 --> 02:14.114
temporary basis to just teach that course. We were 
doing many of the courses off campus, and our

02:14.154 --> 02:24.606
philosophy was to use our on-campus faculty, 
full-time faculty, to teach those. So in putting

02:24.646 --> 02:30.272
my budget together that year, I moved the line from 
Ed Psych to I went in to see, to share my budget with

02:31.501 --> 02:38.012
Thank You Britain, not anticipating that that 
line would be moved at all. I was simply using that

02:38.052 --> 02:48.710
as a political ploy to make a point with him that, 
hey, I was sure the faculty member at psych was

02:38.052 --> 02:48.710
looking for a different, more of an educational 
psychology type person than a cadence type

02:38.052 --> 02:48.710
person. He turned around and picked up the phone 
and called Art Roach, who was in the department,

02:49.371 --> 02:54.579
and asked Art if they'd filled that position yet. 
Art said, no. He said, well, that line item will be

02:55.220 --> 02:58.065
in the IDE next year. Well, he made that decision 
based upon a need that was out there, but you can

02:59.075 --> 03:08.988
imagine the attitude toward Don Clark for a little 
while right then. And so how do attitudes get

03:09.529 --> 03:11.472
evolved? Maybe that was a cold decision he made. 
From my perspective, it was one that needed to be

03:14.516 --> 03:22.667
made, and he made it in a straightforward manner, 
and no guessing on the part of insight why he made

03:14.516 --> 03:22.667
it. It was simply something, do you want to fill the 
position? We'll move it someplace else. That's

03:27.674 --> 03:27.934
right. And I guess in a sense, that was another 
start for putting faculty lines in IDED. And from

03:36.066 --> 03:37.749
then on, we started doing that. And we, quite 
truthfully, we gained some things with it, but we

03:38.190 --> 03:46.385
also lost some of that ability to draw faculty from 
wherever, even though we still do that. As you

03:46.405 --> 03:48.148
know, I teach IDED courses. Dr. Christensen at 
Agriculture Education teaches them. We draw from

03:51.050 --> 03:54.553
various departments, but not to the degree that we 
used to. Do you think that there's more

03:54.573 --> 04:00.539
collaboration in that area, in this area, than 
there is among other departments in the college?

04:00.559 --> 04:08.746
Because I've noticed that there's not a whole lot, 
as much as people would like, you know,

04:00.559 --> 04:08.746
collaboration because of the fact that it's grown 
so much and everybody's doing their thing.

04:08.766 --> 04:14.471
There's a lot of specialty areas now, and people 
are being hired just for one particular. I think

04:14.512 --> 04:20.517
the interdisciplinary education program has 
potential that was never realized because we

04:14.512 --> 04:20.517
ended up making it a department rather than 
keeping it interdisciplinary as a holding tank

04:20.952 --> 04:27.300
for developing new programs. If we had kept it 
truly interdisciplinary as a holding tank

04:28.001 --> 04:39.495
mechanism, as a collaborative arrangement, it 
would have served a better function maybe than

04:28.001 --> 04:39.495
what it has where we have, in essence, made it a 
department. Okay, as all of this has evolved, one

04:39.515 --> 04:46.243
of the things that has happened and has been 
happening not only in the college but at Texas A&M

04:39.515 --> 04:46.243
is the tremendous growth. Has that affected the 
way you work with students? I know I'm hearing

04:49.588 --> 04:50.689
things like, A&M is getting, you know, the 
standards are so high now that we're not getting

04:51.023 --> 04:57.292
the students in that made A&M. They can't get in 
anymore. How do you perceive, you know, what has

04:59.775 --> 05:02.359
happened with students? Well, we might divide 
that into two aspects, both at the undergraduate

05:02.379 --> 05:07.987
level and at the graduate level. Okay. Let me speak 
first to the graduate level. That's when I've been

05:10.831 --> 05:15.057
most involved with the last couple of years, but 
the graduate level, And we, especially in my role

05:16.606 --> 05:27.678
here in the Department of Education, we pride 
ourselves with the open door policy with a lot of

05:16.606 --> 05:27.678
good student interactions. This morning I had a 
student from New York that was here on campus and he

05:27.979 --> 05:42.615
felt comfortable coming in and sitting here for an 
hour talking about not only his academic program,

05:27.979 --> 05:42.615
but also professional goals and some personal 
problems and so forth. I think the academic rigor

05:48.027 --> 05:54.697
of the department, the college, the university 
can only enhance the graduate program. And I don't

05:54.717 --> 06:12.482
see us being any less, in this department at least, 
I think I have to underscore the word this

05:54.717 --> 06:12.482
department, any less open to spending time with 
the students in counseling and so forth. At the

06:12.985 --> 06:19.740
undergraduate level, I'm afraid there's a couple 
of things that are happening that maybe will have

06:12.985 --> 06:19.740
some impact, and that's part of what you're 
talking about, Sylvia, or Kim. Can the students

06:19.800 --> 06:25.572
who used to major in industrial education now get 
into the program? In industrial education, we are

06:26.595 --> 06:32.327
unique in that we have many, many more seniors than 
we have freshmen. In fact, we have many more second

06:33.218 --> 06:37.342
semester juniors than we have first semester 
juniors. It's at the end of the sophomore year, the

06:37.362 --> 06:43.268
junior year, when people transfer from other 
majors to industrial education. They have

06:44.850 --> 06:54.259
finally convinced dad and mother and themselves 
that engineering is probably not the best place

06:44.850 --> 06:54.259
for them. Looking for other, maybe in terms of 
academics, but the high theory that is needed in

07:00.455 --> 07:04.160
engineering programs today. I feel that 
industrial education, whether it be the teacher

07:04.941 --> 07:18.160
certification program or whether it be the 
industrial employment program, is an excellent

07:04.941 --> 07:18.160
place for 20 students to come into if we could just 
get them before they got in all the green point

07:04.941 --> 07:18.160
problems. And I'm afraid, I'm afraid that the 
academic standards are maybe going to be cutting

07:18.180 --> 07:27.913
out some people that would be available for us in 
that major. The counseling of students, again, we

07:28.501 --> 07:34.187
pride ourselves in counseling with 
undergraduate students. We are a small

07:34.207 --> 07:39.172
department, so I think we are able to do more 
individual counseling. Every faculty member

07:39.432 --> 07:42.635
takes that as a personal responsibility. I think 
as you look at our doors, you'll find the mentor,

07:42.655 --> 07:55.808
the Aggie mentor name on most of our doors, more so 
than any, percentage-wise, I'm sorry, I'm

07:42.655 --> 07:55.808
certain it's more than most any other department. 
some other departments in our college. I know that

07:57.540 --> 08:02.287
most of the undergraduate advisement is done by 
one or two people. And we, even though they're much

08:02.588 --> 08:08.517
larger departments, ours is a smaller 
department, we're all involved in that. We pride

08:08.557 --> 08:10.440
ourselves in that. Because that's part of your 
teaching. Absolutely. I mean, it's so important

08:12.223 --> 08:14.005
to teaching. It's a part of it. I guess that's just a 
part of the philosophy of our industrial

08:14.486 --> 08:16.729
education. And maybe it's Ron and I, I think we 
pride ourselves in our student contact. Does each

08:22.340 --> 08:25.824
department have a philosophy as such? Whether 
it's written down or not, probably not, but even if

08:26.365 --> 08:38.921
there's a mission goal, even if there's a mission 
goal and philosophical statement written, I

08:26.365 --> 08:38.921
think more importantly there is a philosophy that 
emerges. Can you capsulize that in your

08:40.663 --> 08:43.587
department? Because I've only had one more 
department. I didn't have that as a question. I

08:47.352 --> 08:47.732
know that the mission or the goal of the College of 
Education, but I haven't. I guess right now,

08:52.124 --> 09:09.504
except for being student-oriented, there are at 
least four things that are happening now in our

08:52.124 --> 09:09.504
department that are somewhat a little hard to say 
exactly the philosophy, the mission statement,

08:52.124 --> 09:09.504
and so forth. And one of those, of course, would be 
the change right now from department head to

09:09.564 --> 09:18.073
interim department head to where we're going in 
the future. And that's where we're going in the

09:18.492 --> 09:33.193
future is one of the things that is very time 
consuming on faculty, very frustrating on

09:18.492 --> 09:33.193
students, and .

09:35.296 --> 09:38.260
Is there any clue of where it might be headed at this 
point? I think, as a faculty, I would hope that we

09:40.543 --> 09:44.569
would stay intact as an administrative unit. We 
are a nationally recognized program cluster. and

09:47.129 --> 09:55.782
the dean has assured us that we are not going to be 
dissolved but we've not seen that evidence and I

09:47.129 --> 09:55.782
think that's a difference in the style of 
leadership of the two deans. We need to evolve

09:57.465 --> 10:09.143
where we're going before we have a new department 
that's going to help us get there and I find that a

09:57.465 --> 10:09.143
little bit awkward. So with that change there's 
some awkwardness in it. With the change in the

10:12.568 --> 10:14.892
whole a five-year program that we're changing the 
total teacher education program within not only

10:15.226 --> 10:20.473
the university but within the state. That is 
another factor that is playing on the corridor.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.363
And then, of course, the legislation thing. So we 
have at least, I said four, but at least the three

10:29.104 --> 10:37.415
would be state mandates, university changes, 
departmental changes. Those three are ones that

10:37.776 --> 10:44.845
are, but through it all, I think we can still say we 
are very much a student Well, you answered a little

10:45.112 --> 10:50.159
bit about the future. There's one that, if you 
haven't picked up on your tape someplace, and you

10:50.339 --> 11:01.494
might get this from some of the adult ed people, 
about the off-campus mission of the college. One

11:01.574 --> 11:12.509
of the things that we've done in adult and 
extension and vocational education, more so than

11:01.574 --> 11:12.509
other departments, is taken our program, 
especially at the graduate level, to the people.

11:12.529 --> 11:14.612
And you're familiar with this, of course, in San 
Antonio. EDCI is now doing this somewhat, they're

11:14.997 --> 11:19.795
taking some courses to Key and to Temple. But using 
the off-campus instructional mode as a way of

11:25.173 --> 11:29.018
meeting a need. I guess this is, again, maybe we can 
talk about philosophy. Our philosophy is that we

11:32.021 --> 11:38.589
do take part of our program to the constituent. 
Again, trying to meet their individual needs, I

11:38.869 --> 11:49.442
think, is an important philosophy rather than 
that everybody must come here to be .

11:50.806 --> 11:54.330
Well, it's been extremely helpful, and it's 
growing by leaps and bounds. And it's a wonderful

11:54.350 --> 11:58.415
service, because I don't know how a lot of these 
people can possibly do it. And at least, even if

11:58.435 --> 12:08.207
they have to come here ultimately, just the fact 
that they have that linkage and they start with

11:58.435 --> 12:08.207
that, then it's motivating to end up here 
eventually, which is good. I

12:09.108 --> 12:19.260
might hit a little bit of you already have on some of 
the highlights and your contributions

12:09.108 --> 12:19.260
specifically, and some insights and 
observations. What about the future as the 21st

12:19.561 --> 12:23.427
century emerges? Just for the College of 
Education, do you have any kind of a perception of

12:23.948 --> 12:30.098
where it might be? One of the things that I've used 
is people have bemoaned the five-year program. If

12:36.328 --> 12:45.923
we reflect back in earlier years, say my mother 
graduated high school in May and started teaching

12:36.328 --> 12:45.923
in September with a certificate by going to a 
two-week workshop. In 1932, it was when the

12:46.561 --> 13:01.541
University of Wisconsin-Stout and Stout State 
Institute and Oswego in New York were two colleges

12:46.561 --> 13:01.541
in industrial education that went from the 
two-year normal school program to the four-year

12:46.561 --> 13:01.541
baccalaureate program. I wonder what the debate 
was in the mid-thirties about moving from a

13:01.561 --> 13:10.493
two-year normal school to a four-year degree. I 
imagine the debate was equally as lively as it is

13:11.570 --> 13:18.096
today, moving from a four-year program to a five- 
or a six-year program. I would judge that 20 years

13:19.217 --> 13:37.695
from now, we will see the master's program, it 
won't be that long, 10 years from now, we'll see the

13:19.217 --> 13:37.695
master's program as much an integral part of the 
teacher education program as we do the

13:19.217 --> 13:37.695
baccalaureate today, and I draw the analogy to the 
two-year normal school syndrome of years past. I

13:37.777 --> 13:54.108
think what I keep hearing from people that are out 
there is, you know, because teachers are not paid,

13:37.777 --> 13:54.108
you know, in comparison to some of the other 
professions, how do you justify making them have

13:37.777 --> 13:54.108
to stay five years in college as expensive as 
college costs or as much as college costs are

13:37.777 --> 13:54.108
rising when they're going to come out making 
$18,000? You know, that's where I think there's a

13:54.228 --> 13:59.177
lot of this, you know, fear that people are just 
It's very hard to recruit for the College of

13:59.528 --> 14:05.475
Education right now because the counselors are 
saying, you know, kids don't want to go into

13:59.528 --> 14:05.475
education. And that's a, you know, we've got to 
overcome that. It's one of these kids don't want

14:07.478 --> 14:09.540
to. It's one of these self-fulfilling 
prophecies. We're right now looking at a

14:14.546 --> 14:20.934
mentorship minority recruitment proposal. And 
we're looking at a minority recruitment

14:20.954 --> 14:24.118
proposal. in which we're wanting to write in 
mentors in there. I just wrote down Fidel Castillo

14:27.016 --> 14:30.602
as an industrial education mentor. And looking at 
individuals out there of any ethnic background

14:31.183 --> 14:38.915
that would recruit people into the profession. 
And I think the teachers are needed to have a more

14:39.576 --> 14:44.183
positive attitude. I might reflect back on the 
Interdisciplinary Education Program. There

14:47.661 --> 14:58.455
were, for a number of years, the students who were 
associated with the Interdisciplinary

14:47.661 --> 14:58.455
Education Program, adult education students, 
vocational education students, thought they had

14:47.661 --> 14:58.455
the best of both worlds. They were really, really 
very positive about the program they were in. And

15:03.001 --> 15:08.668
then we got a couple of faculty members in who were 
associated with IDED who wondered who they were,

15:09.796 --> 15:12.901
where they were, what department. They were 
searching for identity of the department. And

15:16.187 --> 15:22.899
Sylvia, that immediately, the graduate students 
in that department had questions. Who are we?

15:23.500 --> 15:24.101
Where are we? Where do we belong? And two years 
before that, they were very positive. But the

15:27.667 --> 15:32.616
influence of two faculty members who asked that 
question influenced the whole group. I agree.

15:34.349 --> 15:47.807
There's one that's not on tape, but it needs to be on 
there, and that's one of the most rewarding

15:34.349 --> 15:47.807
experiences I've had, and that was working with 
the College of Education Development Council and

15:34.349 --> 15:47.807
being the Associate Dean for Research during the 
initial evolutionary days of that. And I think

15:47.907 --> 15:53.455
this is a program that will be a function a 
committee, a council that will assist us in two

15:53.890 --> 16:01.078
ways as we continue to evolve to the future. One is 
in funding, which of course is one reason for the

16:01.559 --> 16:06.725
Development Council. But the other is we're using 
our Development Council in the College of

16:07.085 --> 16:23.003
Education is also for, because we don't have 
advisory committees, industrial advisory

16:07.085 --> 16:23.003
committees and so forth, we're also using the 
Development Council as a programmatic advisor

16:07.085 --> 16:23.003
sometimes. But I think that the assistance that we 
get from the quality of people we have on advisory

16:23.658 --> 16:38.436
council can't help but be a positive influence on 
both the programmatic thrust as well as the where

16:23.658 --> 16:38.436
we're all to get to. And it's very important to keep 
that momentum that started when you had it. And I

16:41.820 --> 16:45.885
feel it's like being part of the beginning and 
being a part of it now. I feel like we need something

16:46.338 --> 16:52.643
to get everybody together and keep that momentum, 
because that's so important. Otherwise, people

16:52.683 --> 16:53.864
start to play. And we have some fantastic people in 
there that can just really benefit a lot. When this

16:58.689 --> 17:15.383
study is done, and maybe 20 years from now, when 
somebody has to take an ed-ad course and pick up a

16:58.689 --> 17:15.383
dissertation and study or evaluate, and they read 
about the history of the College of Education, is

16:58.689 --> 17:15.383
there something that you would like in there that 
would be just a statement of your contribution or

17:15.616 --> 17:24.729
what you would like to be remembered down the line 
as something that was meaningful. I've

17:24.849 --> 17:28.814
highlighted two things. One was the opportunity 
to be at the right place at the right time during

17:28.995 --> 17:44.256
the expansion time of the college where we could 
use

17:28.995 --> 17:44.256
fairly good appropriated dollars. soft money 
dollars, contracting grant dollars to help

17:44.641 --> 17:58.522
evolve additional programs in the college and 
then to be able to see them evolve into full fully

17:44.641 --> 17:58.522
funded programs. One that I mentioned before was 
Bob Riley's college student program. He had a

18:04.411 --> 18:09.959
funded project for that that also assisted in 
evolving that program to where it is today. And

18:10.660 --> 18:14.125
then the other ones I just now mentioned was the 
Development Council, I'd like to, I wonder what

18:14.358 --> 18:19.527
the history, you and I both wonder what the history 
of that council will be 20 years from now. That's

18:19.627 --> 18:27.982
right, but it was exciting to have been on the 
ground floor, and I know I feel very fortunate to

18:19.627 --> 18:27.982
have been chosen, and I still don't know how that 
ever happened. I thank you, Dr. Barker. This has

18:30.005 --> 18:34.493
been very informative and very interesting, and I 
look forward to visiting some more.
