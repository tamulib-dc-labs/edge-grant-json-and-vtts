WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:24.250
of working with 23 sabbatical and other 
postdoctoral level people from throughout many

00:02.140 --> 00:24.250
different countries and different states and and 
that that meant that that we had people coming in

00:02.140 --> 00:24.250
working normally on their own support or at least 
mostly on their own support and And they had

00:24.668 --> 00:27.651
maturity and motivation. And that made research a 
lot more fun. We could have research group

00:30.954 --> 00:39.343
meetings with people who had worked in South 
Africa or worked in Saudi Arabia or worked in

00:30.954 --> 00:39.343
Indiana. And that,

00:40.104 --> 00:54.118
I think, is the synergism of putting research and 
teaching together and development of these

00:40.104 --> 00:54.118
books, all told, close to 3,000 pages of published 
books. that I've edited and written a significant

00:54.385 --> 01:02.655
part of, but certainly not a major part of. As you 
began here, did anybody, whether you invited them

01:02.675 --> 01:12.586
to or not, did anybody give you any advice, any 
directions? Morris Bloodworth was a very I'd say

01:20.120 --> 01:23.063
friendly and open type of administrator.

01:26.586 --> 01:30.529
I remember talking to him about the fact that, 
well, there was always a need for more money. And I

01:31.490 --> 01:34.773
said, what about writing proposals? And he said, 
well, that's the icing on the cake. And he

01:37.796 --> 01:39.958
encouraged it. But being a large estate as it is and 
as many problems that we have, and fortunately

01:49.432 --> 02:01.226
have had reasonable support within the state, and 
trying to grow as we have, well, that wasn't such a

01:49.432 --> 02:01.226
big issue. But as far as him telling me I should work 
on this or that, he was not very inclined to do that.

02:11.183 --> 02:20.154
I think that he brought things to our attention by 
these meetings that we had, whether they were at

02:11.183 --> 02:20.154
Beaumont or Lubbock or somewhere else. And these 
people all around us, occasionally Godfrey would

02:21.235 --> 02:31.027
come in with some new observation from the field 
that was stimulating. And of course, when we went

02:35.517 --> 02:44.874
out in the state we always looked at the local crops 
and the local soils and this gave us quite a bit of

02:35.517 --> 02:44.874
stimulus and exposure. Was there any area of the 
state that you soon realized needed more than its

02:45.214 --> 02:54.030
proportional share of attention? It seemed like 
that Overton had a high priority at that time. They

03:00.161 --> 03:11.399
had the deep, sandy soils there, but the soil test, 
chemical soil test, didn't jibe with the

03:00.161 --> 03:11.399
response of the plants. And they asked me to come 
and look at the situation with them and had a grad

03:12.000 --> 03:20.053
student that had just started his master's degree 
with me named Frank Hans. And Frank wanted to go and

03:25.151 --> 03:30.128
look at that as possible thesis work. So he went up 
and worked one summer and I remember taking a truck

03:30.445 --> 03:43.500
and a trailer with a backhoe on it and driving to 
Overton to dig that soil pit. I don't know if I would

03:44.261 --> 03:58.478
do that today or not, but it went very well and I was 
really impressed when I got the backhoe to going in

03:44.261 --> 03:58.478
the right direction and got the pit dug about two 
meters deep And there stood the superintendent of

03:58.762 --> 04:05.670
the station and other staff out. I think it was the 
first time they had seen that soil two feet, two

04:06.131 --> 04:11.097
meters deep. And what we could see right away that 
the chemical soil test tested the upper foot of

04:19.147 --> 04:30.023
soil or less and the roots of the plant were 
extending down rather through the full two meters

04:19.147 --> 04:30.023
of Bermuda grass roots so deeply. And we had a 
chemical study and mineralogy study underway but

04:30.844 --> 04:43.382
we learned a whole lot that one during that day just 
from seeing the plant and the soil as they

04:30.844 --> 04:43.382
interacted. So that was one of our first, and then 
we published that work, and Frank Hans is now on our

04:43.362 --> 04:53.355
faculty, as you probably are aware. He later got 
his doctor's degree with Dr. Hosner, and he worked

04:54.336 --> 05:04.189
at Texas Tech for a few years before he joined our 
faculty here. Beaumont was in the rice producing

05:04.709 --> 05:24.231
area, or it is, and they had some problems with the

05:04.709 --> 05:24.231
brooding of rice in that submerged environment. 
Iron toxicity can occur, and that,

05:25.052 --> 05:34.362
they, they were wrestling with. So I had a student 
from China, actually from Taiwan, Tsai Chin Chin.

05:44.205 --> 05:49.610
Tsai came without any money, but he wanted to do a 
master's degree. And he painted houses to make his

05:50.611 --> 05:54.135
living. I couldn't support him at that point. And 
he finally got a job at Beaumont in the summertime.

06:01.713 --> 06:06.739
And then he really began to get into a master's 
thesis on that. And what we found was that the rice

06:07.380 --> 06:25.122
plant pumps the oxygen down into the root zone and 
oxidizes the iron and it precipitates and forms a

06:07.380 --> 06:25.122
red boundary around the roots of the rice. Well, 
one of the questions was, is that a protective

06:25.439 --> 06:35.373
boundary, a layer, and is that preventing the 
phosphate from getting to the root and things like

06:25.439 --> 06:35.373
that? That didn't prove to be the case, but in the 
second phase of that work, we did find that those

06:35.854 --> 06:49.793
varieties of rice that pumped the most oxygen down 
were the best varieties. And they, in other words,

06:50.093 --> 06:56.021
controlled the iron by oxidizing it and 
precipitating it. So that was very stimulating

06:56.462 --> 06:58.164
work. And that stimulated me to think about what 
was happening when iron went from solution to

06:58.664 --> 07:15.527
solid phase in a matter of weeks in the field, a very 
short span of time. In 1982, I went to Arizona State

07:15.507 --> 07:21.295
and did a sabbatical. And that is the national 
facility supported by National Science

07:22.517 --> 07:34.174
Foundation for high resolution electron 
microscopy. And there were no soils people there

07:34.829 --> 07:40.802
and very few geology types. It was a work group of 
engineers, physicists, chemists, and a few

07:43.207 --> 07:50.543
geologists. But they had this built around this 
electron microscopy facility. So for that year, I

07:55.721 --> 08:16.770
learned to use an advanced electron microscope, 
and when I came back and looked at some of those

07:55.721 --> 08:16.770
materials from Beaumont, I could, through that 
instrument, identify the phases better than we'd

07:55.721 --> 08:16.770
ever been able to do it before and characterize 
them. And some were what we call amorphous or

08:16.790 --> 08:20.715
non-crystalline, or close to that, and then some 
were rather well crystalline. So those things

08:25.431 --> 08:31.519
just supplemented each other growing out of that 
study down there. And that work has created quite a

08:31.820 --> 08:36.767
lot of attention because it was so challenging. We 
had probably three different students or

08:37.247 --> 08:42.855
postdocs to attempt to identify those poorly 
ordered phases that formed in the soil and around

08:42.970 --> 08:50.545
the roots of rice. And the fellow who eventually 
solved it was a student who came as a postdoctoral

08:51.326 --> 09:05.333
to us, and he's originally from a very remote part 
of the world. and

09:06.258 --> 09:14.808
what you might think would be an unpretentious 
kind of person, but he turned out to be quite a

09:06.258 --> 09:14.808
scholar. D.C. Golden is his name, and he's from Sri 
Lanka, and he's now employed as a part of the Mars

09:15.288 --> 09:33.008
program in NASA, at the Johnson Pace Flight Center 
in Houston. As you were getting underway here,

09:33.595 --> 09:49.191
were there any subjects or topics that by some 
fashion you understood that those were kind of to

09:33.595 --> 09:49.191
be left alone, don't waste time on them or don't do 
that?

09:52.158 --> 09:55.701
I really can't recall being pushed around at all. I 
think we always had so many possibilities. And

10:02.667 --> 10:21.523
now, I would say perhaps one way of looking at that 
question, there are so many problems that, one,

10:02.667 --> 10:21.523
they have to be approached with such delicacy 
sometimes that we learn fairly early on to be

10:22.128 --> 10:46.692
rather careful about attacking a problem without 
giving it quite a lot of thought because the

10:22.128 --> 10:46.692
conditions, like around the rice roots, many 
times we made some steps forward, but we were not

10:22.128 --> 10:46.692
able to go completely to understanding the system 
more thoroughly until we got different

10:22.128 --> 10:46.692
instrumentation. When I got back from 
sabbatical,

10:51.676 --> 10:58.164
We had a head of our electron microscopy center, 
Carl Duffner. He was hired after I returned from

11:00.367 --> 11:13.644
Arizona, and fortunately for he and I, he was 
trained as Arizona in the same institute where I

11:00.367 --> 11:13.644
did my sabbatical. That's purely a coincidence. 
He was an Aggie, and he had gotten his early

11:15.146 --> 11:20.333
training here in chemistry. and he went out there 
for his doctoral work. Well, he and I chose the

11:23.438 --> 11:35.330
microscope, the 2010 microscope that we have and 
that I've used for the last 18 years or longer, and

11:23.438 --> 11:35.330
he used, too. So those things complemented our 
work here and sort of came together. And now, of

11:43.577 --> 11:49.763
course, we're undergoing a new evolutionary 
stage in the Micro Center. trying to expand it

11:50.013 --> 11:51.796
further. And in fact, Maya serving on the chairman 
of the committee of the Users Committee for

11:53.018 --> 12:03.314
Electron Microscopes through many years was a 
very stimulating experience. And I'd say I got

12:03.394 --> 12:17.556
dealing with Abe Clearfield in chemistry and 
others through that medium that has been a

12:03.394 --> 12:17.556
distinct asset throughout my studies here. In 
your first months, semesters, years, what did you

12:19.837 --> 12:26.229
learn? There were any kind of general guidelines 
for the department? How were you expected to

12:31.519 --> 12:33.483
dress? Were there any things in your spare time you 
weren't supposed to do? Any organizations to join

12:37.551 --> 12:40.877
or not join?

12:44.688 --> 12:47.694
I always felt rather free. We always had a an 
unwritten dress code, I think. I don't have on a

12:53.020 --> 12:54.822
necktie today. In those days, I think I always had 
on a necktie. And I had that shaken a bit. We had a

13:02.693 --> 13:10.764
special meeting at Stanford University at the 
Synchrotron facility they have out there some

13:02.693 --> 13:10.764
years ago. And I found that when I went there, I was 
perhaps the only person on the campus that had on a

13:10.784 --> 13:17.833
necktie. Well, I thought the people at Stanford 
were doing very well without the neckties, and

13:18.050 --> 13:30.512
it's pretty warm in Stanford and pretty warm here, 
and maybe we could get along just as well without

13:18.050 --> 13:30.512
them so much here. But actually the only relaxing 
that's ever been given in terms of instruction is

13:31.133 --> 13:41.070
in the College of Agriculture, and life sciences, 
Friday is considered to be an informal, more

13:41.422 --> 13:47.015
informal day. And if we choose to wear blue jeans, 
then we can wear them then and things like that.

13:52.669 --> 13:54.132
About when did that begin? Not very many years ago. 
I would say something like five years ago. Was

13:59.423 --> 14:02.827
there a formal, was that written down? That was 
written down. It was, okay. I think that

14:04.509 --> 14:10.998
definitely came under our present dean. I think I 
remember Ed Heiler's memo saying that with good

14:11.038 --> 14:20.089
discretion, you may dress informally on Friday. 
In your first years, normally what were the hours

14:25.330 --> 14:28.075
that it was expected you were to be on campus? Get 
here by what time and stay at least until? Well, the

14:32.281 --> 14:40.555
College of Agriculture has, so far as I know, has 
always been rather eight to five-ish. And I've

14:41.328 --> 14:54.943
always enjoyed my work, and I've always been here 
at least that long, and usually a bit longer, and do

14:41.328 --> 14:54.943
a significant amount of work on the weekends. And 
the advent of the computer has really extended

14:55.263 --> 15:00.609
work. And I know a few years ago, I tell students 
occasionally in jest that The main discovery I've

15:07.096 --> 15:16.410
made in recent years, and I was at that point trying 
to get one of these books out, the main discovery

15:07.096 --> 15:16.410
I've made has been Saturday and Sunday. Because 
when you undertake these books and you're working

15:17.010 --> 15:29.288
with dozens of authors from around the world, it 
just takes a lot more time than one would probably

15:17.010 --> 15:29.288
anticipate.

15:32.252 --> 15:34.015
In those early days, Ridge Park, Parked right 
beside the building, yes, yes. And normally was

15:40.094 --> 15:46.542
there a departmental, was there a coffee pot in 
your building? Where did you get? Oh, that always

15:47.924 --> 15:50.928
seemed to take care of itself. There always seemed 
to be a coffee pot nearby. Oddly enough, coffee

15:54.132 --> 16:03.124
without pie doesn't go very well for me, so I've 
never been an ardent coffee drinker. When I was at

16:03.509 --> 16:08.896
Auburn, it was very structured informally. 
People gathered twice a day, I think, to drink

16:09.497 --> 16:13.262
coffee. Certainly they gathered in the morning. 
But I was an oddity. I just couldn't be

16:19.370 --> 16:21.392
comfortable. When I drank that coffee, that took 
up too much of my day. So I was a little bit

16:25.477 --> 16:28.822
rebellious. In those years, where did you lunch? 
I've been a brown bag person so long that I have a

16:33.547 --> 16:42.176
hard time remembering when I wasn't a brown bag 
person. Did you eat your brown bag lunch in your

16:42.617 --> 16:46.601
office by yourself or with a group? Well, I usually 
eat it with the group today and I, well, I say, no,

16:46.762 --> 16:57.253
that's, you have to, one has to think about that in 
context of the building. And we really didn't have

17:02.555 --> 17:12.075
Honestly, I can't remember exactly where we ate 
our lunch when I was in the old state chemist

17:02.555 --> 17:12.075
building.

17:12.511 --> 17:14.133
Was there a group that ate together? There has been 
a group that gathered from time to time throughout

17:14.193 --> 17:23.767
my career here, and some even played bridge in the 
noon hour. I didn't happen to fit very well into

17:23.867 --> 17:25.790
that. But we do a lot of visiting during the noon 
hour, yes. We have in the past, and we do even today.

17:33.521 --> 17:40.290
And some of it is across departmental lines, but 
mostly it's within the department and mostly

17:33.521 --> 17:40.290
among soil scientists. Did people smoke in their 
office in those days? I'm sure that some did. I grew

17:48.100 --> 17:57.070
up in a tobacco patch in western Kentucky, and I had 
a distinct prejudice against tobacco and all of

17:48.100 --> 17:57.070
its products. So I've always stayed on the 
fringes. But yes, we did, unfortunately, have to

17:59.974 --> 18:04.539
smell somebody smoke occasionally. But that 
wasn't much of a problem. You know, when people

18:06.821 --> 18:15.171
realized that I didn't smoke, they were rather 
courteous about not smoking around me. All right.

18:17.277 --> 18:20.425
talking about your initial impressions. You got 
here in the summer. Yes. And that fall, what was

18:24.254 --> 18:31.753
your impression then when the students came and 
football and all the traditions? Describe that

18:32.394 --> 18:34.780
for a newcomer from Kentucky. Well, it was a bit 
overwhelming, and I guess we were mostly

18:35.873 --> 18:47.325
stimulated by it, and we did participate in it to a 
significant extent. I don't think it was as well

18:48.306 --> 18:59.839
developed in those days as it is now as far as the, 
you know, since Rudder Center has been built, our

18:48.306 --> 18:59.839
social atmosphere has been enhanced enormously. 
And we enjoy that and appreciate that. In those

19:03.380 --> 19:11.992
days, I remember gathering in that old Guyon Hall, 
I guess it was, and hearing President Rutter read a

19:03.380 --> 19:11.992
speech to us. And I might say, one of the highlights 
of not coming to Texas A&M that I always remember

19:12.012 --> 19:30.079
was that whenever Dr. Rutter, not Dr. Rutter, but 
President Rutter, had a banquet for the new

19:12.012 --> 19:30.079
faculty, And he said very deliberately, if you see 
anything that you want to do at Texas A&M and

19:31.595 --> 19:49.025
there's anybody standing in your way and you still 
want to pursue this, you come and tell me about it,

19:31.595 --> 19:49.025
please. All right, your impression, describe 
your whole impression of Earl Rudder. Well, he was

19:57.667 --> 20:01.372
big in more than physical form to me. We had 
several, Martha and I had several fortunate

20:03.214 --> 20:09.463
interactions with the Rutters. The first Sunday I 
think we were in church at A&M United Methodist

20:10.724 --> 20:24.923
Church, we chose a position in the pews that looked 
like it was sort of a little bit toward the front,

20:24.903 --> 20:30.232
next to the center aisle, and we sat there. And then 
later, someone told us, said, did you know that

20:31.093 --> 20:40.830
President and Mrs. Rutter normally sit at that 
position? Well, we moved a bit. but not too far. And

20:46.522 --> 20:50.866
so we continued to sit somewhere in that vicinity. 
And I would say on numerous occasions we would look

20:51.047 --> 21:02.318
down the bench or across the bench to see Mrs. 
Rutter and President Rutter. And we always held

21:02.818 --> 21:09.405
him and Mrs. Rutter in very high regard. because 
they were so nice to us. And even today, whenever

21:12.588 --> 21:15.611
Mrs. Rudder sees my wife, she calls her by her first 
name. And when we were in France, we went to the

21:20.415 --> 21:35.730
Normandy coast and saw the site where

21:20.415 --> 21:35.730
our president had led a military assault on that. 
How much did you as a faculty member in those early

21:35.947 --> 21:43.518
years, how much presence did Mr. Rudder have? Did 
you see him much? I'd say, to me, he was very

21:47.827 --> 21:51.152
visible. Of course, I saw him. I drove by his house 
every day going home, and I saw him very frequently

21:53.836 --> 22:02.048
on Sunday. He

22:02.088 --> 22:08.297
wasn't, I would say, so very visible on the campus. 
Otherwise, because I have rather imagine he was

22:10.793 --> 22:13.576
awfully busy in his own office. What image do you 
think that he had, the faculty had of him? Well, I

22:19.882 --> 22:29.692
think that all of us who came in under his, like I did 
while he was the president, I think we held him in

22:19.882 --> 22:29.692
very high regard. And a bit in awe because we knew 
that he did not have an academic background, but

22:36.157 --> 22:43.890
Yet he had high visions, and that's what put him in a 
high place as far as I was concerned. He was not

22:43.930 --> 22:51.603
impeded by what many other people guarded so much. 
Then come on down in administrative order, the

22:51.743 --> 23:00.257
Vice President of Academic Affairs, as we then 
called it, when you got here. Was Wayne Hall still

23:01.722 --> 23:03.624
in that role? I think so. I remember that name, yes. 
And then Zener. Who was Dean of Agriculture? Oh.

23:14.018 --> 23:20.527
Was it Patterson or, oh, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. I 
see. Before, well, it would have been Kunkel.

23:23.474 --> 23:30.923
Kunkel was dean during much of my tenure here. 
Describe him as dean, his manner, his style. What I

23:37.291 --> 23:50.967
liked about Kunkel was that every year when we had 
our January planning meeting for the Experiment

23:37.291 --> 23:50.967
Station personnel, which we still have today, he 
was very scholarly. in his presentations, and

23:51.520 --> 23:55.308
that I appreciated. It seemed to me that he held a 
high standard in the science and the

23:55.348 --> 24:04.609
scholarliness with which he presented subject 
matter. I always thought he had a good vocabulary

24:04.629 --> 24:08.798
and presented himself well. Now, of course, I had 
quite a lot of interaction with Neville Clark, and

24:10.100 --> 24:19.593
I thought he was a good, strong leader. Neville 
was? Director of the Experiment Station.

24:27.023 --> 24:39.060
There were several other support people over 
there, Vic Schimber and so on, that we had some

24:27.023 --> 24:39.060
interaction with, but the dean and the Experiment 
Station director were the two major ones. And I

24:39.580 --> 24:56.847
would say that as I think about a university now, 
looking back versus as an employee and growing up

24:39.580 --> 24:56.847
professionally, it seems to me that the 
administration is a lot more separate when beyond

24:58.717 --> 25:05.725
the department level than I would have expected it 
to be. And thus, the faculty, I think, tends to

25:06.947 --> 25:27.812
expect

25:06.947 --> 25:27.812
a bit of interaction and perhaps a bit of counsel, 
although they're not looking for exactly

25:06.947 --> 25:27.812
instruction.

25:28.231 --> 25:51.808
As I view it now, the dean and the director of the 
Experiment Station, and more now than before, the

25:28.231 --> 25:51.808
department head, is so heavily committed to other 
directions that he doesn't have much time to look

25:28.231 --> 25:51.808
at the faculty and interact with them. We are 
evaluated every year, and I think that's good.

25:55.599 --> 26:01.646
When that first initiated, it was like other 
evaluations. We looked at it with a bit of

26:01.706 --> 26:06.551
suspicion, but it turns out to be a good thing for 
everybody. And I think that's one of the stronger

26:07.132 --> 26:12.298
administrative aspects of the way the College of 
Agriculture is run. I would say if, on the other

26:12.979 --> 26:20.327
hand, we would like to have the whole 
administration evaluated, as we are evaluated,

26:20.307 --> 26:27.634
and we would like for that to be available in some 
summary form so we would see Faculty don't

26:28.238 --> 26:31.882
complain very much in my area. I couldn't register 
very many things. That one few complaints I've

26:34.445 --> 26:57.030
ever heard and I heard time and time again is that we 
would like to know what

26:34.445 --> 26:57.030
the administration does because it seems like 
through the years we've seen an increase in number

26:34.445 --> 26:57.030
of administrators and we've seen a decline in 
number of faculty and a number of support staff.

26:57.010 --> 27:06.064
And we would like to think that in the best interest 
of everyone, we should be able to evaluate the

26:57.010 --> 27:06.064
efficiency of all parties. And that should be 
rather freely open information. Again, back to

27:11.152 --> 27:14.057
the early days, Were there any hints or anything 
about whether anyone could,

27:14.493 --> 27:33.518
their social activities, that one is not to ever be 
seen drinking public, one is never to ever play

27:14.493 --> 27:33.518
poker, one is never to go to this place? Were there 
any guidelines that you understood from

27:33.838 --> 27:38.965
anywhere? Not that I'm aware of. You know, that 
could be that some were, but I wasn't. All right,

27:48.309 --> 27:50.435
now, this is way, way, way back. I asked that of Fred 
Benson a long time ago. And he said when they first

27:53.575 --> 28:03.744
got here, you never, and they were living on 
campus, you were, yeah, this is an editorial note.

28:03.764 --> 28:10.391
This is a conversation with Fred Benson who later 
was a great dean of engineering. He said that when

28:11.051 --> 28:22.722
he and his wife first got here, it was made very 
clear to them that you never served alcoholic

28:11.051 --> 28:22.722
beverage unless you had the shades and the blinds 
closed. and that if you played poker for money, you

28:23.950 --> 28:51.814
also closed the blinds, and that under no 
circumstances did you ever serve alcoholic

28:23.950 --> 28:51.814
beverage if there were any students present, that 
whether it was a faculty student group, there was

28:23.950 --> 28:51.814
to be no alcohol ever served, and that he said it was 
clearly understood that one was expected to go to

28:23.950 --> 28:51.814
worship services pretty regularly. Didn't 
matter what your denomination, whether

28:52.300 --> 28:58.607
Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, but you were to go. 
All right, but now, end of the note. In those early

29:02.211 --> 29:07.296
years, were you ever teased by not being an Aggie or 
not being a native Texan? Did that seem to matter at

29:07.556 --> 29:08.818
all? No, I really never felt that way. In fact, I can 
tell you sort of personally that I always felt that

29:12.782 --> 29:20.991
I was particularly appreciated because I chose to 
come to Texas A&M. And I can't tell you that that was

29:26.563 --> 29:38.338
by my peers especially, and in fact by some that 
were just friends that I had met here locally who

29:26.563 --> 29:38.338
were on the faculty in other departments. And so I 
would say quite the contrary. I think that the

29:42.363 --> 29:50.353
faculty here was very receptive and they didn't 
They didn't try to bring me into line with all the

29:51.852 --> 29:58.025
Aggie trappings particularly. As you met your 
first classes and had your first graduate

29:58.305 --> 30:10.350
students, how did Aggie students compare with 
Auburn and Wildcat students at UK?

30:15.140 --> 30:40.455
This has been a real exciting place to teach and 
it's kind of hard to generalize because the course

30:15.140 --> 30:40.455
that I've taught and taught consistently soil 
mineralogy to graduate students was taken by

30:15.140 --> 30:40.455
civil engineers, oceanographers, geologists, 
soil scientists, occasional ag engineers, and

30:15.140 --> 30:40.455
occasionally rain science. and those are 
students with rather diverse backgrounds and

30:40.435 --> 30:56.115
it's difficult and this is a foundation course in 
soil science so I usually get students who just

30:40.435 --> 30:56.115
arrived from Taiwan or from from Houston or 
wherever, early in their programs. And this would

31:00.522 --> 31:02.605
be as graduate students? Yes, as graduate 
students, but as beginning, early on graduate

31:02.625 --> 31:06.831
students. And so sometimes they had particular 
linguistic difficulty, in a few cases certainly.

31:15.284 --> 31:22.575
And the ones in civil engineering have a very 
different background from those from soil

31:15.284 --> 31:22.575
science or...
