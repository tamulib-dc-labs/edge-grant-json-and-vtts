WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:04.325
with the Texas Department of Community Affairs is 
Larry Crumpton. Larry was one of the early

00:05.106 --> 00:13.716
staffers, right after Shanahan probably left or 
right around in there, worked in housing. And now

00:14.416 --> 00:19.001
he's a deputy over at Texas Department of 
Community Affairs. But Larry has been over there

00:20.083 --> 00:29.413
for a number of years and could describe for you, 
probably in more detail, actually that

00:30.524 --> 00:32.587
certification process. But that certification 
process, if I remember correctly, was sort of

00:32.667 --> 00:41.539
instituted around 72, maybe 73. And it was the 
official certification of planners. And in order

00:47.687 --> 00:57.780
to obtain any of the local planning assistance, 
you had to be certified and to assure that you did

00:47.687 --> 00:57.780
quality work. So I'll have to yield to either Larry 
over there. There were several other people that

01:02.246 --> 01:07.114
worked around with this.

01:09.979 --> 01:20.136
Charles Englishby is one staff person, I think, 
over at TDCA that you might ask about that. Another

01:21.078 --> 01:24.223
question. Would you describe the Texas 2000 
program a bit, and what that was supposed to

01:24.912 --> 01:41.991
achieve, and who the guiding lights were, and why 
it was awarded to the LBJ School of Public Affairs?

01:43.133 --> 01:49.220
Or would you, I don't know if you were close to that 
program or not, Leon. OK. OK, let me try to. pass on

01:54.545 --> 02:00.373
as best I can some of the history of that. And this is 
trying to dredge up a little bit because I never was

02:00.393 --> 02:09.385
actually one of the key participants in it. As I 
understand it, as Governor Briscoe was involved

02:10.506 --> 02:24.265
in announcing his State of the State in 1979,

02:25.190 --> 02:41.131
he did indicate

02:25.190 --> 02:41.131
that there needed to be a created Texas 2000 type 
project to project to the year 2000 what we were

02:25.190 --> 02:41.131
going to be faced with. That's Governor Briscoe. 
My understanding was that it was a brainchild of

02:43.815 --> 02:53.087
someone over at the University of Texas, and I 
can't really identify the key people that might

02:53.742 --> 02:57.265
have brought that up at that time. I think it might 
have been the chap from Philadelphia who has since

02:59.787 --> 03:05.873
left the faculty. Well, I'm not sure. I do know that 
there were several.

03:12.679 --> 03:21.707
Granowski has been mentioned as a person that's 
been involved in the thinking of some of that.

03:22.092 --> 03:26.617
Walt Rostow has been mentioned as a person that was 
very interested in some of this. Walt, I think, has

03:26.737 --> 03:30.982
done a lot of work in water issues and water 
problems. So I don't know exactly who might have

03:32.965 --> 03:38.371
generated it to Governor Briscoe, but it was 
mentioned. In fact, Governor Briscoe made sure

03:38.992 --> 03:43.417
that people remembered that, hey, I mentioned 
this. But it was really, I guess, Governor

03:44.037 --> 03:49.804
Clements that, through his work, you know, 
drilling company experience of being able to, you

03:50.712 --> 04:02.865
know, the one thing about Governor Clements was 
that you talk about short and mid-range planning,

03:50.712 --> 04:02.865
it was sort of a waste of time. But, you know, when 
you start talking about long-range planning, his

04:02.885 --> 04:20.044
eyes lit up because he clearly was appalled at the 
amount of data and information that the state

04:02.885 --> 04:20.044
government had and trying to recognize our 
position in the world affairs and he was extremely

04:20.547 --> 04:29.437
concerned about what we would need to be doing in 
order to deal with the year 2000 and beyond. And I

04:30.357 --> 04:43.271
think that was one of the key things that Governor 
Clements did, is that he felt so strongly about

04:30.357 --> 04:43.271
that that he pushed extremely hard on the Texas 
2000 project. Early, fairly early in his

04:44.272 --> 04:49.558
administration, and I have to draw some dates to 
kind of, benchmark it, but came into office in 69. I

04:55.974 --> 05:10.535
think it was really probably in the spring of 70 by 
the time we began recognizing the governor really

04:55.974 --> 05:10.535
wanted to do something in this and began pushing on 
it. Dr. Vic Arnold out of the LBJ school was brought

05:11.016 --> 05:18.887
over on a part-time basis initially. And then 
shortly thereafter, some period of time

05:19.897 --> 05:29.589
thereafter, it was a deal cut and so forth, and Vic 
was brought over full time. Vic was from

05:30.410 --> 05:33.633
Minneapolis, wasn't he? I believe so, as a 
planning director in Minnesota. And had pulled

05:39.040 --> 05:48.351
off several planning initiatives that were 
similar, not just like it, but similar kinds of

05:39.040 --> 05:48.351
activities. a projections program, that kind of 
thing. And Vic was a very articulate, or is a very

05:53.709 --> 05:58.674
articulate guy. And you might, let me. But the 
Texas 2000 project, Vic Arnold, part of the,

06:03.378 --> 06:18.051
quote, keystones of that was that we were going to 
have state agencies, loan staff, to assist Vic and

06:18.824 --> 06:23.389
to pull off the project. That's the way it started. 
I had the Texas Advisory Commission on

06:25.192 --> 06:31.559
Intergovernmental Relations loaned a staff 
person almost full time. The comptroller, the

06:32.160 --> 06:36.745
general land office were all people. Bob 
Armstrong, at the time, was interested, of

06:37.366 --> 06:41.571
course, in that type project. And a number of 
people. There was a conference here on it at the

06:43.534 --> 06:47.278
Thompson Center, as I recall. There was 
initially, they began trying to structure the

06:47.647 --> 06:51.591
project. Ultimately, there was a Texas 2000 
commission formed. And the commission members

06:57.357 --> 07:13.455
were blue ribbon type private sector people, as 
well as key people like Senator Jones from the

06:57.357 --> 07:13.455
legislature,

06:57.357 --> 07:13.455
Senate finance chairman. And it was a very strong 
blue ribbon type group. There are still staff

07:17.667 --> 07:21.011
people around that worked on that. Vic Arnold, by 
the way, has since gone to the University of Texas

07:21.412 --> 07:37.531
Bureau of Business Research, heads up that 
particular entity, and would be very interested

07:21.412 --> 07:37.531
in explaining

07:21.412 --> 07:37.531
the good things that did occur there. As, again, I 
mentioned, he's very articulate, was able to work

07:37.611 --> 07:47.303
through bureaucracy very well, wrote well, and 
did some good work. In fact, there are some still

07:52.802 --> 08:08.263
pieces of his work that I'm sure he's still 
involved with over at Bureau of Business

07:52.802 --> 08:08.263
Research, because he's still very interested. We 
have little components of Texas 2000 still a part

08:08.423 --> 08:13.350
of our office. The data program that was sort of 
instituted working with Bureau of Census and

08:17.354 --> 08:20.897
trying to do some projections. And so some of that 
is still a part of our office. And it was really some

08:23.980 --> 08:27.003
of that Texas 2000. In order to do much 
projections, you've got to have a database. And I

08:30.546 --> 08:38.653
think the database development and things like 
that are things that we're still struggling with

08:30.546 --> 08:38.653
trying to get a handle on that. Speaking of that, we 
understand that there are several state agencies

08:38.673 --> 08:46.720
that have made population and economic 
projections and that there is no one forecast or

08:47.138 --> 08:55.747
series of projections that the state uses. Would 
you like to comment on that state of affairs, for

08:55.887 --> 09:04.236
example, on water resources and so forth? There 
are a number of state agencies that do population

09:04.256 --> 09:09.141
projections. And primarily, they do it for their 
purposes.

09:17.176 --> 09:24.887
always look at the projections and see that the 
highway department is going to have a set, the

09:17.176 --> 09:24.887
water resource is going to have a set, the health 
department has a set. They tend to try to prove

09:26.910 --> 09:37.726
either that they need a whole lot of additional 
whatevers or the fact that the problems aren't

09:26.910 --> 09:37.726
that great, depending on where they stand. It is a 
very political issue. Governor Briscoe got

09:41.372 --> 09:43.555
killed. early on in his administration, 1973 or 
late in 73 or 74, wound up being in some little town

09:44.159 --> 09:54.192
in South Texas and making a speech. And he just, we 
just released a set of the population

09:54.733 --> 09:59.760
projections. And it essentially said that little 
town was not going to exist in five years. And I tell

10:06.549 --> 10:12.096
you there, you know, subsequent, you could not 
bring that up to that administration. Population

10:12.176 --> 10:13.778
projection was a no-no. It was ultimately the 
demise. At that time, we had a governor's office of

10:17.724 --> 10:20.688
information services. Over 100 employees 
working with trying to develop compatibility of

10:21.549 --> 10:32.684
computers among state agencies and dealing with a 
lot of different issues and database.

10:32.704 --> 10:38.092
Essentially, that agency was eliminated shortly 
thereafter. Over 100 employees. passed away. And

10:44.869 --> 10:53.757
so

10:44.869 --> 10:53.757
there really has not been an official set of 
projections since that time. There were some

10:54.297 --> 11:01.243
efforts under Governor Clements to develop into 
some projections. We never really reached an

11:02.024 --> 11:06.108
ultimate set that everybody used. It continues to 
be something that, of course, When you have a

11:11.791 --> 11:16.356
census like 1980 census, at least you have a 
benchmark. From 70, our data was real weak by the

11:17.557 --> 11:25.066
time you got to 78, 79. There are several things you 
talk about here. You talk about projections, but

11:26.688 --> 11:30.191
you also talk about estimates. Because until you 
have the decennial census, you're flapping

11:30.251 --> 11:37.039
around out there trying to make some real 
unprofessional judgments. Well, we're going to

11:39.789 --> 11:46.498
be saved by the new 1985 census, which will just be a 
head count, just an enumeration. But at least it

11:46.518 --> 11:50.483
will give us a midpoint benchmark. We have on the 
agenda of trying to move into the projections

11:51.284 --> 11:59.295
area, we realize that it still is a political 
issue. But having at least our office is

12:00.858 --> 12:07.026
established as the data center. And we do get the 
most up-to-date information from the Bureau of

12:07.664 --> 12:13.017
Census at a national level. We are trying to even 
make better use of the products that we get out of

12:13.518 --> 12:26.027
the census and different analysis of that data. 
Right now, we're doing a little innovative

12:26.497 --> 12:35.669
project that's not a real pure planning project, 
but you've got to have data. I think that's one of

12:35.689 --> 12:44.221
the key things that we're trying to work on right 
now, is that we have recently provided a

12:35.689 --> 12:44.221
microcomputer to each of the 24 COGs. It was an 
effort to try to at least provide both a technical

12:45.743 --> 12:55.997
link but also a philosophical link between the 
regional planning commissions in our office We

12:56.517 --> 13:22.980
are beginning to try to use that linkage between 
our office to share on our little floppy disk

12:56.517 --> 13:22.980
different kinds of data sets for each region, both 
in terms of information from the census

12:56.517 --> 13:22.980
department, but also information that we can gen 
up A&M,

13:23.956 --> 13:30.425
There's a department over A&M is actually our 
technical expertise on the data center. Are you

13:30.486 --> 13:32.068
all familiar with that? Probably rural 
sociology. Murdoch? Steve Murdoch is the

13:34.652 --> 13:36.835
contact. And his shop does a lot of the technical 
work for us. But we're really trying to use the,

13:41.442 --> 13:50.655
quote, microcomputer to move on into the 20th 
century. do some of this work. Kent, by the way, is

13:53.240 --> 14:02.452
working with our prime in our college, and about as 
much as any student. Aren't you the assistant to

14:02.472 --> 14:03.854
Terry? I'm an assistant to Terry, and I've worked 
with the Army, utilizing the same kind of process,

14:03.874 --> 14:13.907
except with military installations instead of 
COGS. Same type of process. We're working on that.

14:17.572 --> 14:20.676
We have, at the present time in our department now, 
Times have changed, Leon. We have four different

14:22.644 --> 14:25.849
types of microbes in our office. And we're going to 
get a fifth. In fact, we're getting two different.

14:30.596 --> 14:40.050
We're going to end up with six different types of 
microbes in our department, beginning with crash

14:30.596 --> 14:40.050
80s.

14:41.933 --> 14:47.541
We wound up recognizing that there are so many 
different types of hardware floating around. and

14:48.078 --> 14:54.286
so many different types of software and 
incompatibility and so forth. We began trying to

14:54.306 --> 15:09.285
analyze where all the COGs were, and they did have 
different kinds of, you know, they had IBM PCs and

14:54.306 --> 15:09.285
they had, you know, some of them had IBM minis and, 
you know, on them different kinds of pieces of

14:54.306 --> 15:09.285
hardware. But we just finally bit the bullet and 
purchased a TI. We went out for bid and so forth, but

15:15.253 --> 15:17.916
we purchased a TI professional computer with 256K 
and a dual floppy disk and some of that type stuff so

15:18.385 --> 15:33.638
that we now at least have a minimal level piece of 
equipment in each of the COGs. And we can begin

15:33.658 --> 15:43.987
where our key use of that is going to be trying to 
develop our telecommunication network on our

15:33.658 --> 15:43.987
review process. When we're reviewing 
applications for federal funds, They're

15:47.478 --> 15:52.783
actually extensions of our office, and we're 
reviewing local projects. They're going to be

15:52.803 --> 15:57.667
providing that information back to us about 
what's going through their organizations. But we

15:58.328 --> 16:07.977
also see the micro as a first step to really an 
interactive communication between all 24 in our

15:58.328 --> 16:07.977
office on economic development. Because I think, 
as we said about a year ago, economic development

16:08.658 --> 16:16.725
is going to be Mark White's key concern in trying to 
deal with economic development matters. He

16:25.334 --> 16:27.737
created a separate division of the governor's 
office. Hardin-Wiedemann is now heading up. And

16:30.922 --> 16:35.427
it's the key issue that he will deal with. What 
brought about the change in the state planning

16:35.447 --> 16:41.575
officer? Hardin used to be the state planning 
officer. OK. The key interest was that while we had

16:48.076 --> 17:16.986
that office called the Office of Planning and 
Intergovernmental Relations, we had about 20

16:48.076 --> 17:16.986
person staff, 22 person or so, that while we had 
that organization and then we had the budget

16:48.076 --> 17:16.986
office, it was very clear that to really deal with 
economic development matters, there's going to

16:48.076 --> 17:16.986
have to be some dedicated staff, hardened I don't 
know if you recall some of his background, but his

17:17.270 --> 17:25.658
background is tailored very well to economic 
development matters. He's worked on an

17:25.698 --> 17:29.042
international scene. He knows and speaks fluent 
French, German, I think, several different

17:29.102 --> 17:44.577
languages, and has actually developed, was 
working with the National Democratic Party out of

17:44.894 --> 17:48.780
Washington and had a lot of fundraisers for the 
party. So he's dealt in circles of the economic

17:49.061 --> 17:52.646
development industry. Was he involved with his 
business in Dallas too? He was involved in

17:55.551 --> 18:00.198
financial community in Dallas and things. So he 
just had the background. And we began trying to

18:05.086 --> 18:12.538
service Governor White out of that Office of 
Planning and Intergovernmental Relations. that

18:13.042 --> 18:20.551
staff team really did the early work for getting 
MCC in Austin. But what we found is that trying to

18:20.811 --> 18:28.260
deal with those kinds of issues, it took almost 
100% of the time. I mean, you could just chew up a lot

18:28.280 --> 18:37.250
of different man hours in that area and not really 
go on about the business of trying to go beyond

18:28.280 --> 18:37.250
that. So Governor White decided to create a 
separate division in the governor's office and

18:40.058 --> 18:45.304
add focus. And so Hardin took that on. What is Bob's 
background? Bob McPherson started working in the

18:53.674 --> 18:59.941
governor's office, this governor's office, back 
in 1970 or 69. Was involved in manpower planning at

19:01.363 --> 19:07.770
the time.

19:08.392 --> 19:19.390
quite extensive interest, very strong interest 
in planning and background in planning business.

19:20.491 --> 19:22.475
Worked with the Department of Labor for a while. 
Worked in Seattle, I believe it was, and

19:22.575 --> 19:29.786
Washington State in the planning business there. 
Private or public? Publicly financed. I'm not

19:34.852 --> 19:36.735
sure how it was structured. I don't know if it was in 
a public agency. I don't know if it

19:39.378 --> 19:47.389
was publicly financed. Who was the Carter's 
laborer? Ray Marshall. Ray Marshall came back

19:52.757 --> 19:59.326
after the Carter administration ended over at 
University of Texas. That's where he came from

19:59.866 --> 20:02.530
anyway, came back there. And Bob became a key 
advisor to Ray Marshall over at the University of

20:02.881 --> 20:09.368
Texas. And as Governor White came into office and 
began trying to establish, since manpower

20:10.008 --> 20:28.167
business was going through a great transition 
from the old CETA program to the Job Training

20:10.008 --> 20:28.167
Partnership Act, Bob was a key advisor to 
Marshall. And so he became a key advisor to

20:28.828 --> 20:32.652
Governor White sort of contractual basis to 
establish this new program in Texas. And so we just

20:37.989 --> 20:43.417
moved on over really later full time. And so 
Governor White has used him as a key advisor for job

20:43.738 --> 20:48.765
training. And at the time all this transition was 
going on, Bob became sort of a natural to move into

20:49.466 --> 20:57.478
the director of planning job. What is the status of 
state planning today? Does the governor's office

21:03.395 --> 21:10.646
have a plan for planning or a strategy for 
planning? Or what does the governor want done in

21:10.906 --> 21:20.360
terms of the state's role in planning Texas today?

21:22.363 --> 21:26.049
That's one thing that I was hoping Bob could speak 
to. And I hate to answer boring there. We'll ask

21:29.230 --> 21:31.573
him, too. We can compare notes and see if we believe 
the same thing.

21:40.266 --> 21:47.056
We do want to create something that would be very, 
very important. I think Governor White is very

21:47.076 --> 21:51.342
interested in reinstituting planning. We look 
back and see that we've lost ground in a number of

21:51.422 --> 21:59.153
years. We do feel that Like the Texas 2000 project 
was a valuable project to a certain extent. It was

22:06.341 --> 22:20.357
truly a Blue Ribbon project type, Blue Ribbon 
committee type project, but really did not get

22:06.341 --> 22:20.357
involvement or citizens being involved in the 
process. And Governor White is a much more

22:21.058 --> 22:27.385
citizen-oriented, people-oriented governor. 
And while he appreciates and wants the views of

22:27.787 --> 22:43.626
influential people, I think this administration 
will look more toward, OK, now that's what these

22:27.787 --> 22:43.626
folks, under the 2000 project, that's what they 
thought. Now let's go beyond. 2000, under its

22:45.128 --> 22:55.600
process, only dealt with about, I won't go back, 
but six or seven key issues, all oriented around

22:45.128 --> 22:55.600
the economy. all oriented around energy, water, 
and key issues that were mostly those things that

22:56.137 --> 23:09.031
you must have, quote, and to deal with 2000. There 
was no concern or there was no

23:09.071 --> 23:18.701
dealing with human service problems. What will 
our needs be as far as the people? What are our

23:23.306 --> 23:25.468
health problems? There was a human service side 
was something totally left out. I think Governor

23:29.606 --> 23:47.421
White has expressed interest in trying to make 
sure that our planning and our activity deals with

23:29.606 --> 23:47.421
people as well as the physical assets of the state. 
There's only a certain amount of time left in his

23:47.722 --> 23:55.388
term of office before he has to stand for 
reelection or whatever. I think Governor White is

23:55.756 --> 24:01.081
looking beyond a year and a half or so. I think he 
probably feels that in order to lay good

24:01.101 --> 24:09.750
groundwork, it's going to take some time. And I 
think that he believes that he's probably got six

24:09.770 --> 24:17.877
or seven more years to solve the state's problems. 
He's certainly not dealing with things and saying

24:18.718 --> 24:25.645
that I only have a term of two years left. There are 
key things that we're moving out on right now, but

24:26.384 --> 24:35.737
we're trying to, I think Bob will tell you that 
we're moving slowly. We're trying to

24:36.558 --> 24:42.306
re-establish some of the basic premises that we 
had in the early years. One effort right now that we

24:43.447 --> 24:56.205
have a policy paper out on that we might share with 
you, health planning is an issue that's been

24:43.447 --> 24:56.205
around since day one I entered and here we are back 
in trying to restructure, quote, health planning

24:56.523 --> 25:00.648
in Texas. And we have a paper that I think will begin 
showing you what we do believe as far as planning

25:01.389 --> 25:09.578
concepts. There are some guidelines that we began 
establishing in there that I think you will find

25:10.499 --> 25:22.733
reflective of what we're trying to accomplish. 
We're not going to have the blue ribbon, big splash

25:23.573 --> 25:31.162
committees that we deal with at the state level. I 
think the efforts that we make, we're going to be

25:31.222 --> 25:36.869
trying to look at local involvement. And we're 
going to be trying to deal with broad sectors of

25:37.570 --> 25:45.960
issues like health, like jobs. We're going to be 
dealing with those. Economic development

25:48.704 --> 25:52.348
obviously hardened division down there. They're 
going to have an economic development plan that's

25:53.856 --> 25:59.603
going to carve out a swatch. You're talking about 
services, mainly, and a certain amount of

26:01.304 --> 26:05.829
analysis. But it strikes me that the pendulum has 
swung completely to the opposite extreme from

26:05.849 --> 26:21.627
physical environmental planning, because you 
haven't mentioned that at all as part of the State

26:05.849 --> 26:21.627
Planning Office's expected realm of activities. 
Am I wrong in assuming that the state has gotten

26:22.079 --> 26:33.312
completely away from that aspect of state 
planning?

26:34.573 --> 26:44.245
Bob, I think the agenda is still open for, quote, 
the natural resource type planning, interagency

26:34.573 --> 26:44.245
planning activities. Obviously, again, we've 
got the functional planning in each of our natural

26:44.385 --> 26:50.652
resource type agencies. But with the end of TNRAC, 
that is a policy area that is not, on an interagency

26:51.222 --> 27:02.395
basis, it's not linked up. It is an area that I think 
Governor White is ultimately going to have to

27:02.415 --> 27:09.363
shore up. Is the staff here moving in that 
direction at all, in terms of making

27:11.225 --> 27:19.474
recommendations?

27:22.053 --> 27:22.894
I think so. It's just not as clear in that area right 
now as some of the other areas. There's been

27:29.564 --> 27:37.376
pressures and other things that have forced us 
into several issues that we've got that we feel

27:29.564 --> 27:37.376
like it's very much on our plate. Economic 
development does, to a great extent, pick up quite

27:38.778 --> 27:43.926
a few pieces. But water, for example, is a key area. 
that the governor right now is working with both

27:49.087 --> 28:01.865
sides of the legislature, with the Water 
Resources Department, and that area right there,

27:49.087 --> 28:01.865
it hits at the heart of the matter. We've got the 
development types that want all the water that the

28:02.546 --> 28:16.605
state can use to develop our state, and you've got 
the environmentalists that say, hey, you've got

28:02.546 --> 28:16.605
to be concerned about aquifers and other 
problems. So we've got We've got that issue right

28:18.128 --> 28:20.310
before us. But trying to create a council or trying 
to deal with a group that can really get a handle on

28:20.851 --> 28:31.502
that, that's still out. I think the jury's still 
out there. I do not think, I guess this is my staff

28:34.365 --> 28:45.537
perspective, I do not see Mark White creating a 
comprehensive planning function to where it's

28:46.242 --> 28:50.408
all tied together in a neat little package. I see 
him dealing with health. I see him dealing with

28:53.292 --> 28:55.435
economic development. I see him dealing with the 
whole arena of jobs and services for the poor and

28:56.056 --> 29:04.027
planning in that area. Natural resources is one 
that we've got to deal with and will. I feel very

29:10.516 --> 29:11.457
confident. But trying then to overarch that is 
where I'm not sure where Governor White will . I'm

29:20.141 --> 29:38.406
just wondering if, because we've been talking 
about the goals for Texas and how that did bring all

29:20.141 --> 29:38.406
these major concerns together, if that might not 
be a framework that you might take a look at in tying

29:20.141 --> 29:38.406
together the economic and the resource concerns 
and the human services concerns. Well, goals for

29:39.348 --> 29:47.757
Texas were certainly an issue looked at early in 
the White administration because Ed Grisham

29:39.348 --> 29:47.757
became the governor's key program guy. And he was, 
as I mentioned earlier, the lead person for

29:48.338 --> 29:55.585
Governor Smith under Dan Petty to do the old goals 
program. So he very much favored that type effort.

29:59.549 --> 30:00.611
That was certainly looked at. I think the Texas 
2000 project was looked at as a model. And I think

30:05.996 --> 30:07.718
both of those. are things that we will try to glean 
the pieces of. But I do not see right now another

30:12.200 --> 30:17.186
Goldsboro program. I do not see another Texas 
2000. But I think there are little pieces of those

30:19.729 --> 30:31.664
things that will be drawn together in an overall 
program. I think Bob. probably needs to also add to

30:34.647 --> 30:40.513
this, because he's done a lot of thinking in the 
area. As director of planning now, it's certainly

30:41.154 --> 30:46.780
a concern that he's been toying with. And he's been 
getting a lot of input from a lot of different

30:46.920 --> 30:50.764
folks. And I think he'll be the first to say that 
we're trying to establish a complete planning

30:51.705 --> 31:02.477
program. I think he wants to start slow. He wants to 
try to make sure that the planning that's done is

31:04.946 --> 31:10.232
planning that will have results at the end. I think 
he's very concerned about a paper shuffle

31:12.294 --> 31:21.384
planning process where it really doesn't pan out. 
This is a good point, because if we have another

31:22.425 --> 31:32.076
award winning planning program, that doesn't 
lead anywhere, and another Texas 2000 blue ribbon

31:32.714 --> 31:51.634
high pressure committee that doesn't seem to lead 
anywhere, then people are going to become very

31:32.714 --> 31:51.634
wary of programs that don't have any payoff. And 
it's that sort of thing that I think that we as

31:51.654 --> 31:56.199
planners have to guard against. And in that sense, 
I think Bob deserves a lot of support in being quite

32:02.836 --> 32:12.766
cautious about moving ahead and making sure that 
what is done can be quite visible in terms of its

32:02.836 --> 32:12.766
payoff. I think Bob is that type of person. I think 
he studies and reviews. And he's a person with

32:18.972 --> 32:21.214
depth. And he looks at that. And I think once he gets 
settled on where he wants to go, I think we'll see a

32:23.376 --> 32:30.583
very strong program. But I think we're still in 
that. Bob came on effectively around October 1 and

32:32.620 --> 32:42.576
began the process of trying to acclimate into that 
position. And I think we've been trying to grow and

32:43.117 --> 32:54.255
understand the perspective of state government.

32:54.595 --> 32:58.341
I think once we get rolling, it'll be a real strong 
program.
