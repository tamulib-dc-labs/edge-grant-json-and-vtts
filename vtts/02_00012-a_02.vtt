WEBVTT

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:11.414
But first Silver Taps and then on, did you and your Walton Hall buddies respect the tradition and take it seriously when you got back to the dorm?

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:13.778
You all didn't turn your lights on and start partying?

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:15.120
No.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.390
After that, something, I mean we were respecting those people that had just passed away.

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:24.655
We would go back and be solemn for a while.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:32.404
about it for a while and then go back to regular, like it was a regular day.

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:35.307
Then Bonfire.

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:40.392
Describe being a freshman in 97 and your part of Bonfire.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:47.339
That is a very interesting thing, because like I've been talking to my friends, I've been part of both sides of Bonfire.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.186
That freshman year, the first part of it, I didn't do anything.

00:00:55.803 --> 00:01:06.654
They would come up to our room and I was knocking and I had let it go until the last load because other hulls have cut so we'd load.

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:09.477
So I decided to go out there and see what it was all about.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:12.800
I remember going out there and it was a great experience.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.403
It was just everybody loading trucks and doing this and that.

00:01:15.423 --> 00:01:21.369
Everybody was going around and I went out there and I saw them do the dorm log and I was like, wow, this is pretty nice.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.211
I think I've missed out.

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:29.503
So after that I went to perimeter pole, center pole, every other thing when they were building bonfire.

00:01:29.984 --> 00:01:30.865
And I really got into it.

00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:31.927
That freshman year?

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.029
That freshman year.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.532
So I got really into it.

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:36.555
About how many weeks were you?

00:01:37.376 --> 00:01:37.757
Part of it?

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:40.481
I'd say about four or five.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:41.744
Okay.

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:44.047
And where, how far from the campus was the cut area?

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:44.488
Do you remember?

00:01:44.588 --> 00:01:45.550
That I really don't remember.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.932
I don't remember where it was.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.498
What time of day would you go out to join in?

00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:54.014
Well, that last load, it was in the morning, because it was one of the mornings.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:58.499
But the other ones, during the afternoon, weekends in the afternoon or something like that.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.384
But that was after, that's when I decided the next year that I was going to be a big part of it.

00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:05.445
All right.

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:12.272
But that first year, did you see things happening that, did you see some students doing anything they shouldn't have been doing?

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.534
Just the usual, like everybody knows about.

00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:16.115
I was drinking all the time.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.118
What were they drinking, beer or whiskey or what?

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:20.039
I guess.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.061
I can't remember.

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.725
Were some of them over-drinking?

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:24.245
Oh, yeah.

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:24.786
They were?

00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:26.448
Yeah.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:27.590
Okay.

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:28.972
Everybody saw that.

00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:30.835
It's not a big deal.

00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:37.444
Did you or anybody else that you knew well get hurt?

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.531
No.

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:39.132
No accident?

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:39.773
Not that year.

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:41.215
Okay.

00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:42.858
And you all were loading.

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:50.951
Then as Bonfire then is held, what were your feelings as you attended Bonfire?

00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:53.495
It was just something spectacular.

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:56.139
It was just something that, I mean it was a big fire.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.441
I remember it was really hot.

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:01.251
I can't remember, because you're so close to the fire.

00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:04.315
Even though you're kind of away, you're still there and it's so hot.

00:03:05.077 --> 00:03:09.102
And then the yells going on over there and so many, just so many people there.

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:23.964
Was there, on bonfire, either in the physical work to get it prepared and or the bonfire itself, were all the Aggies together or did it matter that you were a civilian student?

00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:27.529
That first year I didn't really see it.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:29.763
It was until later on.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:34.109
When you're building it, you're part of the Aggie family.

00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:41.941
Of course, there's always the Walton is better than Moses and Walton is better than 17 and Squadron or whatever like that.

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:45.387
But it also means y'all are trying to work or outwork them.

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:48.431
Yeah, always, because you're going to want to be the best hall out there.

00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:50.715
You're the best bonfire hall.

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:53.760
And you want to be the best at anything, just like anything else.

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:57.666
But at the end, you're all working to build this one thing for A&M.

00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:04.816
Which, in my opinion, it's A&M first, and then anything else you're a part of.

00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:08.402
It's A&M, and then Walton, and then whatever other organizations.

00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:10.806
It's never anything, it's never above A&M.

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:15.032
That's good.

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:18.648
Okay, you go home Thanksgiving and Christmas.

00:04:19.068 --> 00:04:23.853
How were you, were you feeling more positive about A&M as that first semester goes on?

00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:28.297
I would go home and all I would talk about was A&M and traditions.

00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:31.140
I'd see other Longhorns and all I did was fight.

00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:39.328
Not physically fight, but we're, it was just, we're better than you and you have nothing against us.

00:04:39.348 --> 00:04:45.053
And all I would talk about is traditions and what we would do and what they were, all the Wong traditions.

00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:48.514
That freshman year, I came in and I shaved my head.

00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:53.241
I put an I. I had a letterhead, which was a big I. I ran around this campus in my underwear.

00:04:54.283 --> 00:04:55.244
We did the underwear run.

00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:58.228
And I had done all those things at Bonfire.

00:04:58.348 --> 00:04:59.450
And what was the I for?

00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:04.257
We spelled out, I can't remember exactly what we spelled out, but I remember I was part of the word Bonfire.

00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:08.002
We had a bunch of people with a B and O and so on and so on.

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:10.906
And I remember telling him all that.

00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:12.829
And I had all these pictures to show him.

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.274
And all I can remember, everybody would always talk about parties.

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:21.421
So I really don't think that other schools have our traditions and our unity.

00:05:22.462 --> 00:05:23.563
They're more like party schools.

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:26.806
They don't have what we have here, where we can just go around.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:31.631
And the more I see it now, the freshmen that are coming in from my hometown, they go back and they do the same thing.

00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:36.055
Because I heard this one guy the other day talking about traditions, and I was like, that's me a few years ago.

00:05:36.676 --> 00:05:37.737
I don't do it now.

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:46.264
I mean I've been hearing it that long that you kind of get away from it for a while, but those first two, three years, all I did was talk about A&M.

00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:47.706
All right.

00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:56.055
Then as the spring semester goes on, your grades are going up, were you working harder academically in the spring?

00:05:56.135 --> 00:05:56.295
Yeah.

00:05:56.396 --> 00:06:03.083
Because by that time I was learning the ropes and learning A&M and what you needed to do

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:31.467
improve all right now and you made those decisions no nobody gave you a lecture no advisor you decide that on your own see the best thing about my parents is they told me and they keep telling me it's all you you know it's your life how did you and your parents communicate did you write or no phone calls okay a lot of phone calls they would call me a lot because i'm assuming you are you didn't have email going at that point

00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:33.173
I started mine.

00:06:33.573 --> 00:06:33.934
They don't.

00:06:34.154 --> 00:06:34.815
They didn't.

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:35.656
Okay.

00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:37.199
When did you get a computer in your room?

00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:43.308
Either my junior or senior year.

00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:43.508
Oh, okay.

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:45.311
And that was my roommate's, because he got his.

00:06:45.691 --> 00:06:48.255
I would use all my friends, because everybody on us had some.

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:50.859
I was always using theirs, or the labs.

00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:56.668
Now in Walton Hall, did you all ever play pranks on each other in their room?

00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:59.312
Did you all do anything to anybody else's room?

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:01.555
To ourselves, not that much.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:12.576
But to other halls we'd go and we had back then the balloon launchers, and of course back then it was more like groding other people.

00:07:12.616 --> 00:07:15.881
We'd go over and knock on their doors and they'd come out and we'd just groat them.

00:07:16.783 --> 00:07:19.707
But to ourselves, I really don't remember a lot of the pranks that we did to ourselves.

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:21.610
Were there drown outs?

00:07:22.532 --> 00:07:23.293
No.

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:28.521
Did you all do any kind of stuff in the dining hall?

00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:35.944
It's just the usual, like, with the salt, you take out the top and throw stuff at other halls.

00:07:36.044 --> 00:07:37.125
It was always against other halls.

00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:40.930
We were, we had this model where we don't do stuff to ourselves.

00:07:41.251 --> 00:07:43.494
It's always bring down other halls.

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:47.519
Alright, then you, your spring semester grades are better.

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:51.404
What'd you do then in the summer after your freshman year?

00:07:51.844 --> 00:07:52.725
I remember I went home.

00:07:53.266 --> 00:07:54.728
I had to retake that English class.

00:07:57.172 --> 00:08:02.080
And I only took one class and I started working back home.

00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:04.264
You took that at junior college?

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:05.025
Yes sir.

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.470
Okay.

00:08:08.672 --> 00:08:09.834
You had a job doing what?

00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:14.982
I was working in a copy, kind of a copy corner thing.

00:08:16.785 --> 00:08:17.527
And that was pretty fun.

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:20.091
I would get bored but it was fun.

00:08:21.573 --> 00:08:24.543
So all we did was copies and stuff with copy machines.

00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:26.610
It was a good summer.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.119
It wasn't as fun as I'd hoped it was.

00:08:30.432 --> 00:08:35.336
Because I think every freshman wants to go home that first summer and wants to be with his friends and everything.

00:08:35.677 --> 00:08:41.422
So after that, you start losing in touch with all your friends and people do different things.

00:08:41.462 --> 00:08:47.287
And when you, that first summer, you told everybody what a great place A&M was.

00:08:47.307 --> 00:08:47.627
Yeah.

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:52.392
Did you ever think about transferring to some other school?

00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:52.592
No.

00:08:53.373 --> 00:08:53.493
Okay.

00:08:53.513 --> 00:08:54.293
No.

00:08:54.314 --> 00:09:00.439
The only fear that I had was that I would never be good enough and that I would have to leave A&M and go back home and say I failed.

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:12.893
All right, and engineering was your goal and you said where the idea originated and your dream is to be what?

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.051
In engineering?

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.252
Just an electrical engineer.

00:09:17.253 --> 00:09:19.376
You want to work for a corporation?

00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:21.198
It really doesn't matter.

00:09:21.558 --> 00:09:26.744
My biggest goal was just to become an electrical engineer.

00:09:26.764 --> 00:09:30.388
You come back in the fall, same roommate, same room?

00:09:30.448 --> 00:09:32.430
Same room, same roommate.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.774
Did you dress up the room a little more, bring any more furniture?

00:09:36.254 --> 00:09:38.577
What we did that year, we got a loft.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.067
The second semester of my freshman year, that's when I brought the TV, the VCR.

00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:44.610
Like I said, that's it.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:45.932
We need all this stuff here.

00:09:46.473 --> 00:09:47.315
We built a loft.

00:09:47.475 --> 00:09:48.537
We had couches.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.182
It was a lot better than the first semester.

00:09:51.222 --> 00:09:53.466
Because the first semester, we just had the two beds next to each other.

00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:54.889
And we put that loft.

00:09:54.909 --> 00:09:57.473
We had the loft, the couch, TV, VCR.

00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:02.202
Have dormitory students ever had to worry about theft?

00:10:02.637 --> 00:10:04.500
Anybody ever steal anything from anybody's room?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.802
Yeah, I've heard here and there.

00:10:05.862 --> 00:10:10.849
But in A&M, I mean in Walton, our community, your doors are always open.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.672
Leave your doors open.

00:10:12.692 --> 00:10:13.573
You shouldn't steal.

00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:19.302
The thing was, they said, if we find somebody stealing, we're going to kick your ass.

00:10:19.943 --> 00:10:20.484
Simple as that.

00:10:20.904 --> 00:10:22.767
And about how many people live in Walton?

00:10:23.428 --> 00:10:24.730
I would say 300 and...

00:10:26.228 --> 00:10:27.029
Between 3 and 340.

00:10:27.129 --> 00:10:27.309
Okay.

00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:30.533
And is it a variety of majors?

00:10:31.174 --> 00:10:32.035
Yeah.

00:10:32.055 --> 00:10:32.876
It's every major there.

00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:36.140
And geographically, where are they from?

00:10:36.521 --> 00:10:37.302
All over as well.

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:43.549
I know there's people there that came from California and New York, all over Texas.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.534
A lot of people go in there not wanting to live there.

00:10:48.255 --> 00:10:50.819
They're kind of forced into living, were forced into living in Walton.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.463
But once they live there, they don't want to leave.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.124
Any international students?

00:10:58.144 --> 00:10:58.244
Yeah.

00:10:58.264 --> 00:10:58.544
From?

00:10:58.804 --> 00:11:06.755
India, Asia, I know there's some from Asia, South America definitely.

00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:09.159
Still, are there still nicknames?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.482
Oh yeah.

00:11:11.502 --> 00:11:12.503
Those nicknames will never leave.

00:11:12.784 --> 00:11:18.632
What are some of the, you don't need to tell me the last name, what are some of the goofiest nicknames that you remember?

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:21.095
Gabor.

00:11:21.756 --> 00:11:22.577
Gabor.

00:11:23.553 --> 00:11:33.286
This one guy, we used to call him woman, scrotum, comrade.

00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:38.333
Are there any that are complimentary?

00:11:41.637 --> 00:11:43.840
No.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.186
Do some of them refer to the person's physical size?

00:11:49.628 --> 00:11:53.273
Well, Rocky kind of had that because he was big and he would get into fights.

00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:54.458
There's one ghillie.

00:11:56.728 --> 00:11:57.371
No fats?

00:11:57.994 --> 00:11:58.596
No skinny?

00:11:58.737 --> 00:12:02.875
There were fats, but they say P-H-A-T, fat.

00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:05.275
They really don't go with it.

00:12:05.435 --> 00:12:09.722
And you use those nicknames in the dormitory?

00:12:09.742 --> 00:12:10.403
Yeah, all the time.

00:12:10.944 --> 00:12:16.553
They sometimes even get so much into it that they introduce themselves by their nicknames.

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:22.842
Even though it's really a bad nickname or whatever, they'll still be like, hi, my name is.

00:12:22.923 --> 00:12:25.867
Would they do that elsewhere on the campus?

00:12:26.348 --> 00:12:27.349
Yeah.

00:12:27.369 --> 00:12:28.311
They would use that?

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:29.393
Yeah.

00:12:29.413 --> 00:12:31.596
Hold on just a second.

00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:37.958
Then that fall, your grades continued to improve.

00:12:37.998 --> 00:12:44.824
Any special courses you had in your sophomore year?

00:12:46.486 --> 00:12:58.858
No, I was still with the weed out classes, the physics, English, I mean chemistry, the engineering chemistry, the calculus, engineering 111 and 211, 212, all those classes.

00:12:59.538 --> 00:13:03.422
As you now look back on it, which ones for you were the key classes?

00:13:05.765 --> 00:13:10.152
I'd say definitely calculus and physics, because I still use all that stuff now.

00:13:11.934 --> 00:13:16.020
Some of those I just got by barely, because I didn't like them at all.

00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:17.102
You're saying barely.

00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:17.663
A C?

00:13:17.683 --> 00:13:22.670
Like a C. Scraping through very barely.

00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:24.533
Which did you do best?

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.656
I would say the classes that I've done, you mean about between physics and math?

00:13:31.818 --> 00:13:33.400
Math, the calculus.

00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:39.349
The classes that I really liked were the histories and the poli-sci, because I like history a lot.

00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:43.154
Did you have some teachers you now are grateful to?

00:13:43.835 --> 00:13:44.135
Yes.

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:48.141
Amy Austin.

00:13:48.678 --> 00:13:51.667
Amy Austin, A-U-S-T-I-N?

00:13:51.768 --> 00:13:51.988
Yes.

00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:53.613
She was in math.

00:13:55.219 --> 00:13:57.365
She wasn't a doctor because she hadn't gotten it yet.

00:13:57.385 --> 00:13:59.191
She was just a teacher.

00:14:00.776 --> 00:14:01.759
She was more than a TA.

00:14:03.258 --> 00:14:07.724
She was teaching the class and she was one of those people that taught really well.

00:14:08.565 --> 00:14:17.317
So I had seen a lot of other teachers or professors for the physics that I would wonder why would they even let them teach.

00:14:17.698 --> 00:14:18.699
They were just so bad at it.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.147
They had averages so low that you would wonder why would they even want you to get those averages.

00:14:24.748 --> 00:14:27.652
Why not make the class easier or actually be able to teach?

00:14:28.513 --> 00:14:30.055
But she could teach.

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:32.458
I liked the way she taught and she helped me out a bit.

00:14:32.478 --> 00:14:33.079
Who else?

00:14:38.088 --> 00:14:41.514
And you got the grades you deserved.

00:14:42.075 --> 00:14:46.122
Normally they did not grade on the curve.

00:14:48.426 --> 00:14:52.192
And you're going to class more regularly, studying harder?

00:14:52.393 --> 00:14:53.134
Studying harder.

00:14:54.857 --> 00:14:56.279
I still go to class.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.505
Still in doing your studying in the dorm?

00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:03.291
Yeah, dorm and a lot of it here in the library.

00:15:04.052 --> 00:15:06.215
Where in Evans was the best place for you to study?

00:15:06.335 --> 00:15:06.695
Fifth floor.

00:15:07.576 --> 00:15:08.217
Fifth floor where?

00:15:08.237 --> 00:15:11.741
I would always go, there was only one side of it on the fifth floor.

00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:12.682
That's where I always go.

00:15:12.742 --> 00:15:19.710
Did you have a kind of a special chair that you... Not a special chair, but kind of always try to sit in the same kind of general area or general table.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.434
So if somebody needed to find you they... Then, yeah.

00:15:23.414 --> 00:15:28.204
Now, did you use a little calculator?

00:15:28.264 --> 00:15:29.547
What kind of...

00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:34.417
I remember I had to buy an 83, TI-83, and it became really helpful.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.448
Normally, about how much free spending money did you have?

00:15:41.012 --> 00:15:44.038
It would depend because I really don't spend a lot of money.

00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:48.066
I save a lot of it, and I really don't need stuff.

00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:50.289
I'm not a person that likes to go out shopping.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:54.714
I've only gone to the mall, to this mall here, about three times since I've been here in five years.

00:15:56.276 --> 00:15:57.278
Unless I really need something.

00:15:57.598 --> 00:15:58.760
My parents send a lot of stuff.

00:16:00.482 --> 00:16:04.908
Either somebody goes over there and brings it to me or... You're talking about clothing or food or what?

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:06.070
Food.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.693
Clothing, what I have, I've had it for a while.

00:16:08.943 --> 00:16:10.026
And I just feel comfortable.

00:16:10.046 --> 00:16:11.610
I don't need to buy new stuff.

00:16:12.332 --> 00:16:15.921
This year I had to buy more dress-up clothes because of RHA.

00:16:16.382 --> 00:16:18.828
So I had to represent it at all the meetings.

00:16:19.991 --> 00:16:26.327
Where did you and your buddies go to have a good time?

00:16:27.725 --> 00:16:30.988
A lot of it was in the home, with my friends, there in the dorm.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.855
Or parties that the dorm would throw at different locations off campus.

00:16:37.756 --> 00:16:39.077
Some clubs, we'd go to some clubs.

00:16:39.237 --> 00:16:41.239
There was this one Tejano club here.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:41.820
Where?

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.121
Down in Bryan.

00:16:43.462 --> 00:16:44.863
It was called Tejano Ranch.

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:46.765
We'd go there a few times.

00:16:47.946 --> 00:16:48.587
Just anywhere.

00:16:48.627 --> 00:16:52.351
So much stuff to do some of those weekends.

00:16:52.771 --> 00:16:56.015
Did you encounter many people using drugs?

00:16:57.076 --> 00:16:57.276
No.

00:16:57.914 --> 00:17:01.898
I don't think I've ever seen anybody use an illegal drug.

00:17:01.918 --> 00:17:03.319
A lot of drinking, yeah of course.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.082
And by and large what were people drinking?

00:17:07.323 --> 00:17:10.687
It was funny because I would see a lot of natural light in the dorm.

00:17:11.848 --> 00:17:13.129
The cheapest beer you can find.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:14.851
Where did they keep it?

00:17:15.732 --> 00:17:19.235
In the fridge or stuff like that.

00:17:20.016 --> 00:17:23.640
Is that according to the rules or are they supposed not to have it?

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.904
I don't think back then you were supposed to have it.

00:17:29.065 --> 00:17:32.370
If the two people living in the room are both 21, they can have it there.

00:17:33.311 --> 00:17:34.954
But if one of them's not, then you can't have it.

00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:40.282
And I remember in some parties, even in the dorm, they used to have kegs, which was really not allowed.

00:17:40.862 --> 00:17:43.747
One of my friends got kicked out of campus for having a keg in his room.

00:17:43.767 --> 00:17:44.348
They caught him.

00:17:45.009 --> 00:17:46.130
You mentioned beer.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.133
Did you see much whiskey being consumed?

00:17:48.253 --> 00:17:51.879
I saw a lot of beam and a lot of Everclear, just everything.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.042
Wine, gin, vodka?

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:54.643
Everything.

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:55.444
Tequila?

00:17:55.424 --> 00:17:57.210
Is that right?

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:57.711
Definitely.

00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:03.268
Let's see, did you and your buddies go to the MSC much?

00:18:04.392 --> 00:18:05.134
No.

00:18:05.154 --> 00:18:08.083
Oh actually that first two years we would go to play pool.

00:18:08.992 --> 00:18:10.554
Down at the 104.

00:18:16.761 --> 00:18:20.445
Many things in Rudder Center?

00:18:20.545 --> 00:18:23.188
Did you go to concerts, entertainments?

00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:23.929
No.

00:18:23.949 --> 00:18:25.450
Let's see, did you go to basketball games?

00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:26.571
One.

00:18:28.193 --> 00:18:29.254
In the first two years I went to one.

00:18:29.655 --> 00:18:33.539
All right, so in athletics you went to almost every home football game.

00:18:34.721 --> 00:18:36.062
What other athletic events?

00:18:37.139 --> 00:18:38.161
A few volleyball games.

00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:39.803
We would like to go and see the girls.

00:18:40.645 --> 00:18:41.186
Baseball?

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:42.147
No.

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:43.770
Oh yeah.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.154
At least three games per year.

00:18:47.135 --> 00:18:47.716
I thought they were fun.

00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:49.940
They always have them at all times.

00:18:50.822 --> 00:18:56.571
Did you and any buddies hit the road and go to the big cities, Houston, Dallas, Austin?

00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:56.972
Austin.

00:18:57.633 --> 00:18:58.474
My roommate and I.

00:18:58.494 --> 00:18:58.995
How often?

00:19:01.304 --> 00:19:02.706
Month to month, maybe.

00:19:03.087 --> 00:19:04.228
Because he had family there.

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.851
Did you spend the night over there?

00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:06.572
Yeah.

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:07.734
And where would you all go?

00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:09.296
Sixth Street?

00:19:09.957 --> 00:19:12.901
We went to Sixth Street maybe a few times, but that wasn't our big thing.

00:19:13.582 --> 00:19:16.066
We'd go more to, there was more Tejano, more Spanish stuff.

00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:19.371
Did you wear your Aggie stuff when you went?

00:19:20.072 --> 00:19:21.254
Yeah, I remember that.

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:26.902
I would go to places and I would try to wear, I mean we'd try to dress up, but I would wear anything that I had Aggies with.

00:19:27.744 --> 00:19:29.927
And I didn't have my ring yet.

00:19:30.329 --> 00:19:37.238
I remember the first year I bought a wallet with the A&M sign, and I had that with me all the time and just anything I could all the time.

00:19:37.258 --> 00:19:39.400
Did they tease you over there?

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:44.346
Not so much because we had spent so much time with my roommate's sister.

00:19:44.727 --> 00:19:48.692
But whenever we went out, people just looked at us, but it was just not a big deal.

00:19:49.813 --> 00:19:53.738
All right, and your pride in being an Aggie is growing.

00:19:54.967 --> 00:19:56.268
By the time you were a sophomore?

00:19:56.468 --> 00:19:57.009
Yeah.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.289
Why?

00:19:57.769 --> 00:19:58.110
Why?

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.434
The traditions and the fact that I was learning more and more about the school.

00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:09.780
And by the time I was a sophomore, I went to every load except one.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.842
So by then, I was big into bonfire.

00:20:13.043 --> 00:20:15.505
From the previous year that I said I was going to do it, I said do it.

00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:17.167
I earned my load shirt.

00:20:18.668 --> 00:20:23.873
Now as a sophomore, did you participate in the loading just as the freshmen did?

00:20:24.353 --> 00:20:24.433
Yes.

00:20:25.865 --> 00:20:28.969
And every load, how often would that be?

00:20:29.009 --> 00:20:30.311
Every weekend.

00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:31.292
Every weekend.

00:20:31.432 --> 00:20:33.715
For about four or five weeks, maybe six weeks.

00:20:34.637 --> 00:20:37.560
We'd go, if there was a home game, we'd only go Sundays.

00:20:39.303 --> 00:20:42.607
If there was a away game, we'd go Saturday and Sunday mornings.

00:20:42.827 --> 00:20:47.974
So you and your buddies would go out to the load area and you would load?

00:20:48.663 --> 00:20:49.824
and you would stay out there.

00:20:51.386 --> 00:20:53.448
What did you all eat or drink while you were out there?

00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:56.712
Sabisa would provide us with the meals.

00:20:57.293 --> 00:21:03.800
There would always be sandwiches, chips, an apple, orange juice.

00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:08.365
During lunch, that's what we would eat.

00:21:08.705 --> 00:21:10.007
Our hands were always dirty.

00:21:11.328 --> 00:21:13.050
The water we would drink was black.

00:21:13.992 --> 00:21:14.813
But we had a great time.

00:21:15.013 --> 00:21:16.175
It was some fun times.

00:21:16.515 --> 00:21:19.539
Now, were there any coeds out there at all?

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:19.719
Yeah.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.021
What were they doing?

00:21:23.003 --> 00:21:25.066
If they were the water girls, they would just be there serving water.

00:21:25.387 --> 00:21:28.290
OK. At Lodeside, there was only two or three girls.

00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:30.173
They were the ones that were serving water.

00:21:30.193 --> 00:21:31.755
Were they in the Corps, or were they civilians?

00:21:31.775 --> 00:21:32.395
They were civilians.

00:21:33.537 --> 00:21:36.921
The other halls had, they were cutting over there, and they had girls.

00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:39.625
But that was written in a lot.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.168
Now, did you all have women living in Walton?

00:21:42.188 --> 00:21:42.829
No.

00:21:42.869 --> 00:21:43.490
Y'all were all men.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.830
Yeah.

00:21:44.063 --> 00:21:48.252
How were those girls that were out there pouring the water, how were they treated?

00:21:50.136 --> 00:21:51.920
Because they were giving us the water, they were treated well.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:57.071
Until they got towards lunch, we would throw them in the puddle of water and grow them.

00:21:59.075 --> 00:22:03.945
And after that, they would all pick them up and just, not throw them around, but just play with them for a while.

00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:07.939
But they were treated well because they did bring us water and we would always be tired.

00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:16.214
And while you were out there in the load area, did anybody in authority ever come by to check and see how things were being done and that everything was in order?

00:22:16.314 --> 00:22:21.724
In all three years that I can remember, maybe once or twice or three times, but not really.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.435
And how far would y'all carry a log?

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.501
10, 15 feet.

00:22:30.801 --> 00:22:31.241
That's all?

00:22:31.462 --> 00:22:32.483
Yeah.

00:22:32.503 --> 00:22:38.448
The trucks were there and the logs would be dragged there and we'd just pick them up and then just haul them over.

00:22:38.588 --> 00:22:43.073
So you literally, just to pick them up and load them, it wasn't to drag them over.

00:22:43.393 --> 00:22:43.573
No.

00:22:44.014 --> 00:22:45.315
The tractors dragged them over.

00:22:45.335 --> 00:22:45.935
Tractors dragged them over.

00:22:45.955 --> 00:22:49.779
We would pick them up and then haul it over the truck.

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:53.803
And they had already been cut and trimmed and topped.

00:22:57.486 --> 00:22:59.228
Let's see.

00:22:59.562 --> 00:23:17.638
One of the questions I normally ask, but you wouldn't have any of this, I can't think of any world event or national event during until last September where you would know exactly where you were when you heard the news that.

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:20.921
The only thing I can think of is when Bonfire actually fell.

00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:23.866
Yeah, yeah, we're going to get to that, we're going to get to that one later.

00:23:23.906 --> 00:23:26.250
Okay.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:33.522
You, are you, your sophomore year you're not involved in any of the campus organizations yet?

00:23:34.143 --> 00:23:40.032
Actually, by that time I had started getting into, involved, getting involved in a lot of stuff.

00:23:40.052 --> 00:23:42.276
That year I was intramural chair for Walton.

00:23:43.302 --> 00:23:49.650
I was a reporter for an organization called MANRS, which is Minorities in Agricultural, Natural Resources and Related Sciences.

00:23:51.301 --> 00:23:54.045
And I was getting involved in Mexican Student Association.

00:23:54.585 --> 00:23:57.009
Mexican Student Association?

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:58.290
MSA.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.754
MSA, okay, all right.

00:24:00.914 --> 00:24:01.995
Not Mexican American?

00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:03.698
No, Mexican Student Association.

00:24:03.718 --> 00:24:07.142
Did that include both Mexicanos and Tejanos?

00:24:07.523 --> 00:24:08.184
Yeah.

00:24:08.204 --> 00:24:09.385
Oh, okay.

00:24:10.006 --> 00:24:15.734
And what, describe what that organization was trying to do and what your role was.

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:19.519
MSA, I was really getting into it.

00:24:20.461 --> 00:24:24.808
It was mostly just getting together, have a few parties, getting Mexican culture out.

00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:27.993
Manners was the other one that was trying to recruit more minorities.

00:24:28.894 --> 00:24:35.164
And that one I got a little bit more into, and the reason why I got into it was because my roommate one day said, he was in it, and he said, hey, let's go over.

00:24:35.204 --> 00:24:36.045
They're having elections.

00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:37.808
And I just went over that day.

00:24:37.828 --> 00:24:40.812
They had elections, and I raised my hand for reporter, and I got it.

00:24:43.096 --> 00:24:49.185
And you turned in, in your duties as reporter, you turned in information to whom?

00:24:49.857 --> 00:24:52.302
To the general people attending the meetings.

00:24:52.844 --> 00:24:55.630
Like I would get information and report what had gone on.

00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:57.935
You were reporting to them, not for them.

00:24:57.995 --> 00:24:58.195
Yeah.

00:24:59.238 --> 00:25:01.102
And then in Walton I was intramural chair.

00:25:01.342 --> 00:25:07.917
And that was a lot of work because I got the all-intramural champ that year, the plaque, for Walton.

00:25:08.808 --> 00:25:12.493
And I would go up and down getting people to go play sports, and I would sign them for everything.

00:25:13.394 --> 00:25:14.135
And that was a lot of fun.

00:25:14.436 --> 00:25:15.157
That was a lot of work.

00:25:15.217 --> 00:25:21.705
Now, in intramurals, did you all compete with corps units as well as civilian dogs?

00:25:21.725 --> 00:25:22.086
All of them.

00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:22.326
Okay.

00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:25.731
And what were the primary sports?

00:25:26.472 --> 00:25:31.859
Football, soccer, baseball, and basketball.

00:25:31.879 --> 00:25:37.887
And then we had squash and some other sports that I had never thought, heard of, but people wanted to play them, so we would sign them up, tennis and baseball.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.402
Let me turn it off.

00:25:41.485 --> 00:25:47.793
And so you helped with intramurals and you enjoyed that.

00:25:48.094 --> 00:25:50.858
Yeah it was a lot of work but fun.

00:25:51.138 --> 00:25:56.225
Any problems, any difficulties?

00:25:56.686 --> 00:25:59.389
With that, sometimes people would sign up but they didn't want to play.

00:26:00.271 --> 00:26:01.292
So there I am going

00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:03.909
through ramp to ramp trying to get players.

00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:14.498
Sometimes we would have to forfeit and pay dues or pay late fees, but I would go a lot of times going up and down the ramps trying to get players to go out.

00:26:15.058 --> 00:26:16.320
That was the only big difficulty.

00:26:17.621 --> 00:26:28.130
And meanwhile your grades are going up, and so you finish your sophomore year, go home, what did you do that summer?

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:28.730
Work again?

00:26:30.012 --> 00:26:30.452
I worked.

00:26:31.613 --> 00:26:32.715
at the same place, I think.

00:26:34.358 --> 00:26:37.203
And then I took another class.

00:26:37.243 --> 00:26:41.451
I took History 106 in community college.

00:26:42.153 --> 00:26:42.934
And that was so easy.

00:26:44.557 --> 00:26:48.024
The thing that I remember most about the summer is meeting this one girl that went to Baylor.

00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:50.508
And I remember meeting her.

00:26:50.969 --> 00:26:54.195
She would sit in front of me and one day she turned around and I started talking to her.

00:26:54.749 --> 00:26:56.994
And I asked her where she was from, and she said she'd go to Baylor.

00:26:57.014 --> 00:26:57.716
And I started laughing.

00:26:58.858 --> 00:26:59.119
Why?

00:26:59.179 --> 00:26:59.900
I just don't remember.

00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:00.842
So she hated me.

00:27:01.845 --> 00:27:03.488
But after a while, we started becoming good friends.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.992
We started going out.

00:27:06.996 --> 00:27:09.161
And just a lot of stuff happened with her.

00:27:09.221 --> 00:27:12.488
And I think that was the highlight of that summer.

00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:15.434
And there was just problems here and there, and it was just fun.

00:27:15.474 --> 00:27:17.098
And then I came back again.

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:18.200
All right.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.909
During, do you have a steady girlfriend now?

00:27:21.929 --> 00:27:22.690
No.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.911
All right.

00:27:22.931 --> 00:27:24.655
Where did you and your buddies get dates?

00:27:25.036 --> 00:27:25.998
How did you get dates?

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.207
We had friends that were here, so we'd go out with them.

00:27:30.187 --> 00:27:34.675
just meeting people here from some of the halls like Neely and all that.

00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:39.023
My freshman year, I forgot to say, that was a very good story that I met this one girl.

00:27:40.165 --> 00:27:41.447
And that was the first girl that I met here.

00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:43.250
And we just hit it off.

00:27:43.992 --> 00:27:46.997
But I was kind of going out with a girl back home that

00:27:48.513 --> 00:27:52.057
I had never been, I had never gone steady with her, but we were kind of close.

00:27:53.138 --> 00:27:55.501
And it was just a very interesting story with that one too.

00:27:56.923 --> 00:28:02.109
It ended up kind of bad because the first semester she left, or actually the first year, she didn't make it back.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:07.094
And I hadn't talked to her since, but it was a pretty good story.

00:28:08.276 --> 00:28:17.406
As far as you could tell, how were women during your years here, how have women

00:28:18.415 --> 00:28:20.141
student, female students, been treated?

00:28:20.161 --> 00:28:22.528
They're a lot different here than they would be at home.

00:28:23.712 --> 00:28:31.277
And a general thing that I see, college girls are a lot different, but Caucasian girls are a lot different than Hispanic girls.

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:33.097
Yeah.

00:28:33.959 --> 00:28:36.783
Well I didn't have a lot of these Caucasian girls back home so I didn't.

00:28:37.104 --> 00:28:37.625
All right.

00:28:37.685 --> 00:28:37.985
How?

00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:42.152
They are just more open.

00:28:43.334 --> 00:28:46.520
Their thoughts are just much more different.

00:28:47.121 --> 00:28:48.463
Oh, all right.

00:28:48.603 --> 00:28:50.186
That's not the way they're being treated though.

00:28:50.446 --> 00:28:51.007
Oh treated.

00:28:51.147 --> 00:28:51.828
Oh treated.

00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:54.192
Oh I didn't hear that.

00:28:54.212 --> 00:28:55.915
Are Aggie coeds treated fairly?

00:28:56.924 --> 00:29:02.370
Sometimes, depends on the girls too, depends on how much they can take and how much they let you do.

00:29:03.251 --> 00:29:07.996
But some of them would just be, they let themselves be treated really badly.

00:29:08.717 --> 00:29:14.302
I would hear a lot of bad stuff, and what would always surprise me was that they would always come back.

00:29:14.322 --> 00:29:16.625
They would be treated kind of bad, next day they were still back.

00:29:17.346 --> 00:29:20.349
And I would be thinking, if you don't like to be treated like that, why do you keep coming back?

00:29:20.569 --> 00:29:23.772
And treated bad, what would be some?

00:29:24.353 --> 00:29:26.155
For example, I remember this one time,

00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:34.542
There was this one girl, and they would always call her a slut and a bitch and all these things, and treat her really bad in front of everybody else, but she'd be there the next day.

00:29:35.563 --> 00:29:38.267
If it were somebody like me, I'd be like, ha ha, I'll see you guys later.

00:29:39.108 --> 00:29:40.490
But no, they would keep coming back.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.713
Some people just like to be treated bad, I guess.

00:29:42.733 --> 00:29:43.033
All right.

00:29:43.053 --> 00:29:48.160
Now, those were insulting words to her, but also they were insulting words used

00:29:49.068 --> 00:29:50.530
to some of the guys too.

00:29:51.111 --> 00:29:51.331
Yeah.

00:29:52.313 --> 00:29:55.978
It was always the bad words like gay and all those things.

00:29:56.418 --> 00:29:57.760
Some of those guys even came back as well.

00:29:58.261 --> 00:30:06.412
Were the Hispanic women in this way, were Hispanic women treated any differently from the Anglo women?

00:30:06.713 --> 00:30:10.618
It was a lot different because I really didn't get to see a lot of Hispanic women around our groups.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.206
I mean granted that there are not a lot of Hispanic people around the halls.

00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:29.522
Did, would there have been any, would there have been any problem if you had had some dates with an Anglo co-ed here?

00:30:29.842 --> 00:30:31.745
No, not at all.

00:30:31.765 --> 00:30:32.927
I never.

00:30:33.848 --> 00:30:40.057
And did you and your Hispanic buddies, did you all think that a gringo should not date a Tejano?

00:30:40.277 --> 00:30:41.499
No, we never.

00:30:43.302 --> 00:30:46.446
It depends on the people, but I really,

00:30:46.696 --> 00:30:49.040
A lot of us didn't see rays or color or anything like that.

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:52.785
We saw a bunch of Aggies and that was kind of it.

00:30:53.146 --> 00:31:00.598
Of course, you always have to remember, and this was more jokefully, being called the wetback and all that other stuff.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.502
But we'd always make fun of each other.

00:31:04.203 --> 00:31:06.747
Somebody would call me that and I would just find a name and

00:31:09.241 --> 00:31:11.427
Now back on.

00:31:12.349 --> 00:31:13.452
I'd like to ask a quick question.

00:31:13.472 --> 00:31:14.234
Sure.

00:31:14.254 --> 00:31:15.658
Because I just heard you say something right now.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.563
Where were you born?

00:31:18.425 --> 00:31:20.871
In Dallas County, a little town named Garland.
