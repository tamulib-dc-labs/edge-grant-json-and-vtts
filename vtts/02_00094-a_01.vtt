WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:08.849
It is November the 20th, and we're checking to see that it works.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.311
Now just say a sentence or two.

00:10.331 --> 00:11.753
I'm going to on.

00:12.053 --> 00:12.474
On, yeah.

00:12.774 --> 00:13.154
Okay.

00:14.236 --> 00:15.377
Let's see if it's working now.

00:18.441 --> 00:29.734
This is November the 20th, the year 2000, a beautiful College Station Day, and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with John Greer.

00:30.406 --> 00:35.113
a long time and very respected faculty member in architecture.

00:35.814 --> 00:50.597
John, for the sake of the people who might hear this tape at some future date and or read the transcription, describe first your background and experience before you came to A&M as a student.

00:50.617 --> 00:53.822
What did mom and dad do and where did you all live and where did you go to high school?

00:55.104 --> 00:57.848
Well, I went to high school in Port Arthur, Texas.

00:57.997 --> 01:00.561
My mother and father were both public school teachers.

01:00.982 --> 01:03.286
My father was a school principal for a long time.

01:03.326 --> 01:19.814
Then my father was elected the county tax assessor of Jefferson County, Texas and served in that capacity about 13 years, I think, while mother continued teaching and she moved into Lamar University and taught Summit.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.059
The college level mother was an English teacher.

01:23.731 --> 01:28.181
And my father was mostly an administrator, I suppose, would be fair.

01:29.244 --> 01:30.927
Finished high school what year?

01:31.088 --> 01:33.613
Finished high school in 1952.

01:35.518 --> 01:38.164
And then came immediately to Texas A&M University.

01:38.244 --> 01:40.930
Why did you come to A&M instead of some other place?

01:42.209 --> 01:44.453
I didn't understand I had any other options.

01:48.419 --> 01:59.256
The kids seem to agonize over that these days, but my father told me one day in the living room, I recall vividly, because he said, you're pretty good at math and you're pretty good at drawing and

02:00.181 --> 02:09.892
You might ought to consider architecture, and I did at that moment, first time I'd ever heard the word probably, and now our one, as we say.

02:11.394 --> 02:12.335
I came here.

02:12.395 --> 02:18.442
Did you come to visit ever as a prospective student?

02:18.462 --> 02:23.488
Yes, I did come to visit and visited my uncle, who was Fred Bryson.

02:24.447 --> 02:33.979
And Fred Bryson at that time was the next door neighbor to Ernest Langford, longtime neighbors and old people of a similar generation.

02:34.820 --> 02:46.274
So I got to meet my department head and the famous man, he was even famous then, when I was a freshman, before I started school here.

02:46.735 --> 02:51.501
So he knew me and I knew him early.

02:52.156 --> 02:55.740
I've got to tell you some Langford stories before we're through.

02:55.780 --> 02:56.841
Don't forget that.

02:56.861 --> 02:57.761
Yes, we want those.

02:58.622 --> 03:03.607
We'll get those later, while he was your teacher.

03:05.609 --> 03:06.290
He was.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.852
When you came up to enroll, how did you get here?

03:11.455 --> 03:12.796
Did mom and dad bring you?

03:12.896 --> 03:14.278
Did you come on the train or the bus?

03:14.378 --> 03:15.479
I didn't come on the train.

03:15.619 --> 03:17.861
I never have ridden a train, as a matter of fact.

03:17.901 --> 03:19.783
I want to do that so bad I can hardly wait.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.380
No, we didn't use the train.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.763
I suspect that my family brought me.

03:26.824 --> 03:28.165
I don't recall that, actually.

03:29.006 --> 03:35.892
But every other trip from then to graduation was hitchhiking back and forth to Port Arthur.

03:36.312 --> 03:38.234
We'll talk about hitchhiking in a second.

03:38.514 --> 03:42.918
And several of us hitchhiked sort of together a lot.

03:42.998 --> 03:48.063
Do you remember what you brought with you in the way of stuff when you came to enroll that first time?

03:48.103 --> 03:48.423
Of course.

03:48.483 --> 03:50.665
I brought a mechanical equipment set.

03:50.645 --> 03:54.290
And a slide rule, as I recall.

03:54.330 --> 03:58.295
And what else did I bring?

03:58.335 --> 04:05.825
Not many clothes because I was in the Corps of Cadets, which was mandatory then.

04:05.845 --> 04:09.130
And so we didn't need a whole lot of clothes.

04:09.150 --> 04:14.577
In fact, probably most of the clothes I did bring ended up taken home at the first opportunity because we didn't need them here.

04:15.434 --> 04:21.703
And was your major that first year, did you identify yourself as an architecture major?

04:22.024 --> 04:27.752
Yes, but I actually enrolled in engineering because architecture only started accepting people in September.

04:27.772 --> 04:34.843
And the fact was I came in January, so I was a midterm guy.

04:34.958 --> 04:38.501
And so I had to do something until following September.

04:38.561 --> 04:49.552
So I actually was in the class of 55 by A&M's classifications, but ended up taking most of my classmates were in the class of 56.

04:50.953 --> 04:54.456
And you were in the Corps then that spring semester.

04:54.596 --> 04:54.917
Yes.

04:56.058 --> 04:57.559
Was there a special nickname for?

04:57.779 --> 04:58.680
Yes, Frog.

04:58.780 --> 04:59.681
I was a frog.

04:59.701 --> 05:01.843
Oh, a frog, although you were not a transfer.

05:02.093 --> 05:02.554
No.

05:03.115 --> 05:05.639
No, frog simply meant anyone that came at midterm.

05:06.099 --> 05:09.064
What frog meant was you missed the football season hazing.

05:10.006 --> 05:13.231
Now, that's the fact of the matter.

05:13.271 --> 05:22.866
But the fact of the matter also is that when I came here as a 7, 18, whatever it was, year old person, I had no idea that I'd missed anything.

05:23.547 --> 05:26.111
You know, I came, I graduated from high school and came to Texas A&M.

05:26.672 --> 05:29.637
I didn't know any better.

05:31.422 --> 05:33.985
Except that I had a good first semester in engineering.

05:36.068 --> 05:41.655
I would have probably waited, tried to find a job or something or do something and come back and come in the fall.

05:42.096 --> 05:45.180
But I didn't know anybody at the time, so I just went to school.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.665
And then in fall, you were identified as an architecture major.

05:48.745 --> 05:49.005
Yes.

05:49.446 --> 05:51.929
Who helped you pick out courses?

05:53.611 --> 05:54.392
No one.

05:56.313 --> 06:02.745
If you're going to ask me, I think, about some things that have changed since I got here,

06:03.316 --> 06:05.339
I picked out my courses.

06:05.419 --> 06:08.264
I read the catalog and read it from front to back.

06:08.344 --> 06:17.839
It wasn't very much reading, actually, and it didn't seem particularly complicated, and the curricula was pretty straightforward and laid out, so there wasn't a lot of choice to be made for several years.

06:19.081 --> 06:23.588
At least two years, maybe three.

06:24.509 --> 06:30.218
So I never had a counselor or an advisor or anything of the kind.

06:31.615 --> 06:38.546
except that I was fairly close with the department head, and if I ever had any need to, I knew I could go and see him, but I never did about that kind of business.

06:38.867 --> 06:48.783
Now, at that time, architecture was a big department within the School of Engineering, as it was then.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.305
Was it a School of Engineering?

06:50.325 --> 06:52.008
Yes, yeah, because it was A&M College.

06:52.268 --> 06:52.869
That would be true.

06:53.390 --> 06:54.392
That'd be true, yeah.

06:54.893 --> 06:58.298
And do you have any idea how many students there were?

06:58.717 --> 07:01.780
In the architecture program, I think about 100.

07:02.561 --> 07:03.842
That'd be pretty close.

07:04.042 --> 07:07.486
That'd be five years of about 20 people per class on average.

07:07.686 --> 07:09.267
That's probably close, maybe 150.

07:09.327 --> 07:14.773
Describe some of those first classes you took in architecture.

07:17.575 --> 07:22.280
Were any of them particularly, as you look back, especially important to you?

07:25.063 --> 07:26.344
The very first classes?

07:27.910 --> 07:37.103
My best recollection of the first classes I took was that they all seemed to be basically repeats of things I had had in high school.

07:39.527 --> 07:48.600
And that included analytical geometry and trigonometry and English and all of those kinds of things I thought was basically, they were easy for me.

07:48.780 --> 07:50.923
So I had made awfully good grades in my first year.

07:52.025 --> 07:52.125
Okay.

07:52.145 --> 07:53.547
But what about the architecture courses?

07:53.908 --> 07:55.470
The architecture courses were

07:56.665 --> 07:59.007
taught by graduate students at the time.

07:59.428 --> 08:00.389
I didn't know any better.

08:00.649 --> 08:07.156
I didn't learn until many years later that the people that taught them were just barely older than me, but they seemed older at the time.

08:08.377 --> 08:10.759
And they were funny.

08:10.799 --> 08:17.046
We took our first courses in what we call the shacks, the old military barracks on the north part of the campus.

08:19.328 --> 08:25.474
And we had a couple of those buildings, as I recall, at least one, but I think we had two.

08:26.517 --> 08:30.443
And so we took those courses over there, and it was like being in bivouac.

08:30.503 --> 08:32.286
It was like being out someplace.

08:33.428 --> 08:39.417
And most of the courses we took were in the academic building quadrangle area.

08:41.941 --> 08:44.104
History was in one of those buildings, I know.

08:45.805 --> 08:49.510
Math, English, I think we're all in the academic building.

08:50.491 --> 08:56.719
But we didn't take architecture courses in the academic building until our second year, which was my third year, actually.

08:57.861 --> 09:02.807
Was there any way, any effort to get you architecture students together?

09:04.169 --> 09:04.890
All of the students?

09:06.331 --> 09:08.975
Or to help the freshmen bond together?

09:09.095 --> 09:09.315
No.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.458
I don't recall any.

09:12.974 --> 09:16.519
The upperclassmen had what was called ASABAB in those days.

09:17.381 --> 09:19.123
How did you know that?

09:19.344 --> 09:20.826
ASABAB, I believe.

09:21.306 --> 09:22.108
ASABAB.

09:23.950 --> 09:29.699
Associated Architecture School, Annual Boark Ball or something like that.

09:30.020 --> 09:36.349
And people have tried to recreate Boark's balls for years, but they've never gone by that

09:37.004 --> 09:39.387
acronym again, quite like that.

09:40.228 --> 09:42.772
But that was fun and entertaining.

09:43.393 --> 09:45.155
Nevertheless, it was not much of a mixer.

09:45.736 --> 09:47.698
It was just a big blowout party.

09:48.579 --> 09:54.828
In your freshman, sophomore year or so, if you needed any advice about anything, to whom did you turn?

09:58.973 --> 10:02.438
I guess the most fair thing to say would be you turned to someone in your military outfit.

10:03.127 --> 10:05.812
one of the upper-classmen or something like that.

10:06.312 --> 10:12.162
But we didn't do much of that, actually, except for my friends and my roommate and that kind of person.

10:12.363 --> 10:17.011
My roommate was a high school classmate of mine, so we've been close friends for a land.

10:17.031 --> 10:21.338
He lived in the same block with me in Port Arthur, so we knew each other even before high school.

10:22.381 --> 10:27.067
When did you begin to feel really committed to architecture?

10:27.668 --> 10:28.329
When and how?

10:29.250 --> 10:34.057
I can't remember ever not being committed to it, but it wasn't like a religious calling or something.

10:34.097 --> 10:37.121
It just sort of happened and it worked out.

10:39.023 --> 10:44.811
I was never discouraged because my grades were always pretty good, so I didn't feel like I was misplaced somehow.

10:46.647 --> 10:52.596
Who were some faculty members that now you realize were important to you in their influence?

10:52.836 --> 11:07.018
I counsel my kids all the time about these matters, and I now know that two or three, I had two or three professors that were not particularly good at what they were doing, but I learned an awful lot from them.

11:07.538 --> 11:15.354
I learned, which I can now say in retrospect, because I learned if I were ever in the same situation, things I would not do.

11:15.394 --> 11:17.778
I would try to do better or differently.

11:19.301 --> 11:23.590
But they were very nice people, most of whom were mayors of College Station at one time or another.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.702
Nicky Holloman was one.

11:26.643 --> 11:30.187
Nicky was blessed as a sweetheart of a man, but he wasn't much of a teacher.

11:33.291 --> 11:38.037
Dick Vrooman, who's still around here, was my sophomore teacher.

11:38.177 --> 11:47.468
Back in my day, there was only one section of each architecture class, so we had Dick Vrooman for the sophomore year in architecture.

11:47.650 --> 11:49.953
About how big were those sections?

11:50.734 --> 11:52.196
No more than 20, I wouldn't think.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.118
25, maybe.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.322
But we would have them both fall and spring term.

11:58.023 --> 12:00.766
He'd be our year prof. Now, that's only in the design studio.

12:00.806 --> 12:07.454
That would not include the materials classes and structures and all those kinds of things were separate.

12:07.474 --> 12:09.557
And my third year prof was Nicky Holloman.

12:10.803 --> 12:13.526
That's H-O-L-L-E-M-A-N.

12:13.626 --> 12:15.749
That's M-O-N, I think.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.290
Oh, yeah.

12:17.531 --> 12:17.911
H-O-L-L-E-M-O-N.

12:17.971 --> 12:18.572
Like the street.

12:18.652 --> 12:19.253
Like the street.

12:19.433 --> 12:20.634
The street's named after him.

12:20.835 --> 12:24.078
And Broman is V-R-O-M-A-N.

12:24.178 --> 12:24.839
Two O's.

12:24.859 --> 12:26.281
Two O's.

12:26.301 --> 12:27.682
Vrooman, some people call him.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.807
And then my fourth year professor was Frank D. Lawyer.

12:33.169 --> 12:40.337
And Frank Lawyer was traded by Ernest Langford and Bill Cadell.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.229
They traded Lawyer and Romanek.

12:44.010 --> 12:44.852
I watched them do that.

12:44.892 --> 12:47.135
Not many people know that that actually happened that way.

12:48.117 --> 12:53.885
Lawyer was a wonderful designer and went on to become the lead designer for CRS, the architecture firm down in Houston.

12:56.730 --> 12:58.392
And he's a form giver, as we call him.

12:58.412 --> 13:02.458
He's one of those guys that can just do form over and over and do it all the rest of his life and do it beautifully.

13:03.339 --> 13:05.042
But he wasn't much of a teacher.

13:05.410 --> 13:05.810
either.

13:05.851 --> 13:14.281
He could sit down and do it for you, and it was always nice to see that done, but it wasn't yours, so it didn't work.

13:14.301 --> 13:18.345
And my fifth-year prof was Edward John Romanek.

13:20.508 --> 13:34.084
I learned last night, because Romanek is in Polish, and means those that came from Romania.

13:34.790 --> 13:35.351
To Poland.

13:35.592 --> 13:38.117
To Poland.

13:40.021 --> 13:43.148
That's R-O-M-A-N-I-E-C.

13:47.718 --> 13:49.542
Romanek and lawyer.

13:49.775 --> 14:00.612
were literally traded like baseball cards between Frank, I mean, Bill Caudel, who had his firm here at the time just beginning, and Ernest Langford.

14:01.353 --> 14:03.256
And I was beneficiary of the trade.

14:03.937 --> 14:12.070
Lawyer went to CRS, and Romney came from CRS into the school, and he started teaching at the fifth-year level, and that's where I was.

14:12.826 --> 14:17.792
At the time, so we were Mr. Romanek's first class at this institution.

14:17.812 --> 14:19.795
Describe him as a beginning teacher.

14:20.956 --> 14:22.939
As a first-year teacher?

14:23.239 --> 14:26.343
Well, actually, it was his third teaching job.

14:26.543 --> 14:27.585
It was his first year here.

14:27.625 --> 14:28.165
First year here.

14:28.205 --> 14:34.193
He taught at Oklahoma State and at someplace else, I don't recall right now.

14:34.561 --> 14:35.482
He was awfully good.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.385
He was a mystery man.

14:38.445 --> 14:49.255
Romanek has been the kind of guy that 50 years of former students or 40 years of former students have sat around and said, the man never said anything.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.576
He never made any sense.

14:50.656 --> 14:54.480
He never made a sentence that you could understand what he's talking about.

14:55.641 --> 15:02.948
And then after he would leave your company, before very long, you'd have this bright idea, this really smart, wow, I could do it this way.

15:03.822 --> 15:11.473
And it took most of us years and years and years to actually realize that something he said triggered that response.

15:11.854 --> 15:13.436
But we never knew quite what it was.

15:14.017 --> 15:15.800
But we all thought he was a great teacher.

15:17.002 --> 15:22.410
And I had the good fortune of having him on my faculty when I was department head for a little while.

15:24.653 --> 15:26.876
And I got to watch him from the other side.

15:26.896 --> 15:32.665
Mr. Romanek gave, Mr. Romanek was mean and tough.

15:33.117 --> 15:35.942
and scary, and we thought he was really old.

15:35.962 --> 15:37.464
He was 13 years older than we were.

15:39.988 --> 15:46.318
But he was a Chicago guy, just come down from New York or via Oklahoma.

15:46.338 --> 15:55.613
But he was a rough kid, and we were all afraid of him.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.236
Describe him physically.

15:57.256 --> 15:57.997
What did he look like?

15:58.097 --> 16:00.441
Oh, he was a little short Polish fella.

16:01.315 --> 16:07.584
Not very tall, had very thin hair, but combed it in one of those great swooping front wave things.

16:07.665 --> 16:11.050
I don't know how he made his hair stay that way, but he did.

16:11.350 --> 16:12.291
And a bit eccentric.

16:12.832 --> 16:13.593
Quite eccentric.

16:15.376 --> 16:17.179
We've got lots of good Romanek stories.

16:17.219 --> 16:18.741
Everybody's got good Romanek stories.

16:18.761 --> 16:19.663
Share two or three of them.

16:19.683 --> 16:20.344
Oh, my word.

16:21.225 --> 16:22.367
Most of them have to do with bars.

16:22.387 --> 16:25.371
You may not want this on your tape, Haskell.

16:28.836 --> 16:29.297
Romanek.

16:29.817 --> 16:43.843
One of the things that Ramanick is most noted for around here is taking students out from this campus, getting them out of here, getting them to the east, getting them to Mexico, getting them away from this place, even overseas.

16:49.514 --> 16:53.361
And most of the time when he took people out, he entertained them as well.

16:55.180 --> 17:02.819
I knew Romnick for nearly 40 years probably, and I never ever bought a meal or a drink.

17:03.621 --> 17:04.864
He always bought them.

17:05.486 --> 17:08.734
And at some point when I was department head or in the dean's office,

17:09.035 --> 17:13.445
and he was working supposedly under me, beside me.

17:14.868 --> 17:18.476
I finally told him, I said, Romerick, you've got to let me buy sometimes.

17:18.757 --> 17:21.262
Come on now, I get to buy sometimes.

17:21.764 --> 17:24.750
And he says, no, you've never caught on, John.

17:24.830 --> 17:26.875
This is called the pass it along theory.

17:27.749 --> 17:28.971
You don't buy for me.

17:29.312 --> 17:30.153
I buy for you.

17:30.433 --> 17:32.457
You buy for the people coming behind you.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.520
And you don't ever let them buy.

17:34.861 --> 17:39.729
That's how you pay me back is you pass it back to the people coming behind you.

17:39.749 --> 17:42.012
And he did that to countless people.

17:42.453 --> 17:43.295
Countless people.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.617
And we do it now all the time.

17:44.657 --> 17:48.423
We don't let any former student or kid pick up a tab for anything.

17:49.084 --> 17:54.533
Anyway, Romanek had just come back from one of his trips with some former students and

17:55.390 --> 18:00.019
They ended up over to his apartment and were having some of his famous Martoonies.

18:01.562 --> 18:03.987
And Romnick managed to get drunk.

18:04.448 --> 18:06.332
And they had gone off in a car and they came back.

18:06.372 --> 18:14.649
When they came back, he lived over here at University Terrace Apartments just south of the golf course on what was then Jersey, now George Bush Drive.

18:15.571 --> 18:17.314
When he went into the parking lot there,

18:17.986 --> 18:19.288
And he was a dean at the time.

18:19.628 --> 18:29.020
And you have to remember that the president was Earl Rudder, who had gone to New York to hire him personally, which we all kind of thought was cute.

18:29.120 --> 18:33.546
He and Fred Benson flew to New York to interview Romanek and hired him on the spot and brought him back.

18:33.566 --> 18:38.413
And the word around here was, oh, my God, guess who they're bringing back with him, you know?

18:38.433 --> 18:40.575
Anyway, he pulled up into the parking lot over there.

18:40.615 --> 18:46.423
And in those days, cars had fenders that wrapped outside the car, little bumpers that wrapped outside the car.

18:47.568 --> 18:57.182
And he had pulled up in this parking garage, which was made out of little two-inch pipe columns, little pipe things, and had a corrugated top on it or something.

18:57.222 --> 19:02.950
He pulled in there, and he realized, apparently, I wasn't there, but he realized, apparently, that he had gotten in a little crooked.

19:03.611 --> 19:13.385
And so he thought he had back up, and cars at that point just had gotten a little, what he called those gears, beside the stick shift, the other kind.

19:13.405 --> 19:16.309
Anyway, the car lurched a little bit and hit the car

19:16.728 --> 19:20.413
that he was pointing at on the right-hand side as he was pulling in this parking place.

19:21.634 --> 19:25.819
He hit that car, and he quickly threw it into reverse and started backing up.

19:25.839 --> 19:30.365
And when he did, his bumper caught the little pole that was holding up the parking garage.

19:30.925 --> 19:35.751
He pulled down the whole, before he was through, he had pulled down the whole parking garage.

19:35.811 --> 19:37.714
Eighteen cars or something were damaged.

19:38.675 --> 19:42.019
And, of course, the police showed up, and he loved to ride around in his car.

19:42.039 --> 19:46.144
I can't see how people stand to do this, but he loved to ride around in his car with his window about half up.

19:47.035 --> 19:50.062
Not down, not up, just half up.

19:50.082 --> 19:57.298
And this was the first car that he had had, and most of us had at that time, with fingertip window things.

19:57.859 --> 19:59.984
And he hadn't quite learned which one was which yet.

20:01.146 --> 20:03.111
Indeed, a policeman showed up on the scene.

20:03.632 --> 20:05.095
Mr. Romanek was still in the car.

20:06.458 --> 20:11.266
And the policeman showed up and put his fingers, put both hands, I understand, up on the window.

20:11.807 --> 20:15.894
And we're saying, Mr. Romnick or whatever, you need to get out of the car.

20:15.974 --> 20:17.536
We need to talk here a minute.

20:17.556 --> 20:23.506
And Romnick was fiddling with a window thing and rolled his fingers up in the window like that.

20:24.448 --> 20:32.601
And the people that were there said the policeman just looked awful like Romnick was just probably going to drive off with him with his fingers up in the window like that.

20:33.155 --> 20:36.559
Anyway, he was constantly doing things like that.

20:36.579 --> 20:41.144
And the next morning, of course, he had to report to General Rudder to report why the police were over at his place.

20:41.545 --> 20:46.190
And he had damaged 18 cars behind his place over there.

20:46.350 --> 20:46.931
He was beautiful.

20:47.231 --> 20:54.039
As an instructor, did he have any guidelines for you students?

20:54.079 --> 20:56.462
What did you all know that he expected from you?

20:59.075 --> 20:59.976
We never did know.

20:59.996 --> 21:03.740
I think that was part of what made him scary, because we didn't know.

21:03.760 --> 21:13.149
I watched him one day when I was department head, and he'd gone up to look at a student's work that was in his class, and it was probably just like our class.

21:14.250 --> 21:17.533
And he walked over, and he looked at his work, and he said, unacceptable.

21:17.973 --> 21:21.697
And this was a pretty nice looking thing the student had created.

21:22.358 --> 21:23.399
And he just said, unacceptable.

21:23.419 --> 21:26.922
And he turned around and walked off, and the student was following Mr. Romnick.

21:27.273 --> 21:28.435
What is wrong?

21:28.495 --> 21:28.875
What is wrong?

21:28.895 --> 21:29.716
I said, there are no dots.

21:31.659 --> 21:32.480
No dots?

21:32.520 --> 21:33.802
I don't know what you're talking about Mr. Roy.

21:33.822 --> 21:34.723
What do you mean no dots?

21:34.783 --> 21:40.310
I finally found out what he was talking about and I went back and told the student, he said he couldn't see any columns.

21:41.371 --> 21:43.054
This has no structural identity.

21:43.454 --> 21:46.518
He couldn't identify immediately how your structural system was going to work.

21:46.558 --> 21:47.019
No dots.

21:47.539 --> 21:48.521
That's all he could think of.

21:48.581 --> 21:51.505
That was what would show on the plant is this little dot thing.

21:52.005 --> 21:54.889
Anyway, he was a non-communicative guy.

21:55.209 --> 21:55.710
Nice

21:56.180 --> 22:04.094
And I was going to tell you a minute ago, he gave nearly everybody in our class that came to class A's.

22:05.657 --> 22:12.910
And most of us, A's were not customary in those days, just to have almost a class full of A's.

22:13.511 --> 22:15.454
Of course, we were fifth-year people.

22:16.345 --> 22:23.980
Nevertheless, what he did, and I watched him do this over 30 years, what he did was he encouraged, and we're talking about a subjective field here.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.784
We're not talking about the answers right or wrong.

22:26.906 --> 22:32.096
What he did was he made people believe that they were better than they believed they were themselves.

22:32.757 --> 22:38.809
And then they became better because he set a standard and everybody wanted to please him.

22:39.430 --> 22:41.713
All their life they wanted to please him.

22:41.733 --> 22:50.806
He told me when I left here, this is one of your facts, he told me when I left this place, told our whole class when we left here, he said, don't you go to work for anybody for less than $3 an hour.

22:51.727 --> 22:55.192
And if you do, you're going to embarrass me and you just don't even call back.

22:55.252 --> 22:58.937
You just don't even let me know where you are if you go to work for anybody for less than $3 an hour.

22:59.718 --> 23:02.663
And the going rate then was about $2, $2.50, somewhere in that range.

23:02.683 --> 23:06.568
But he said, you're a Romantic graduate and you'll work for $3 an hour or you won't work.

23:09.147 --> 23:13.011
I went to work for 250 and I was afraid to call back.

23:13.071 --> 23:14.652
I was afraid to let the man know where I was.

23:16.634 --> 23:21.539
But of course I did later on and I quickly exceeded that and everything was fine.

23:23.121 --> 23:24.702
He didn't follow through with his bluffs.

23:24.742 --> 23:25.863
He just scared you to death.

23:25.963 --> 23:35.232
Like my standards are just a little higher than the rest of the world's and certainly higher than most of the other faculty and I expect you to set high standards for yourself and live up to them.

23:35.252 --> 23:39.036
That was the message that somehow you had to glean out of all of that.

23:39.337 --> 23:47.913
As you finished your undergraduate degree here, how well prepared did you feel you were to be an architect?

23:47.933 --> 23:50.639
The minute I walked out here, I didn't feel like I was prepared at all.

23:51.841 --> 23:57.151
And I tell my kids today, part of it is called senioritis.

23:57.372 --> 23:58.814
I don't think I've learned anything.

23:58.834 --> 24:01.800
I don't think I'm ready for this.

24:02.540 --> 24:08.166
But the fact of the matter is you've learned a lot more than you think you have and that you can recall at the time.

24:08.226 --> 24:21.540
And you've certainly, in this particular field, you've learned many lessons about holistic things, putting things together, thinking complexly and envisioning what's happening above and sideways and all at the same time.

24:22.141 --> 24:25.785
And that is not taught necessarily.

24:25.805 --> 24:30.690
It's practiced, developed, but it's not a teachable skill, I don't suppose.

24:31.902 --> 24:33.905
But we were better prepared than we thought we were.

24:34.786 --> 24:45.440
As you look back now, knowing what you know now, what did the architecture program do best, and what might it have done better then?

24:46.862 --> 24:57.657
Well, I was privileged to start just behind the people that graduated in what would be called a Boart system, or the classical system, studying the orders and things like that, just behind them.

24:58.700 --> 25:24.235
Bill Caudell was on this faculty for a little while and taught some people that were about 10 years older than me and they drew the classical columns and shaded them with ink watercolor wash and the beautiful drawings just absolutely wonderful but it was a different kind of school but that changing of the kind of school was just happening in that

25:24.552 --> 25:51.657
20-year period all over the country so that we were we were just getting into what was being called modernism and that was to begin to think about the building and its place in the environment which is completely different idea than the building will have six columns across the front and all that pretty well set you had very little to do

25:52.430 --> 25:56.195
So in that regard, I thought the school did pretty well with us.

25:57.456 --> 26:06.147
Compared to the other, the graduates you encountered of other architectural programs in this region, was A&M up to date compared to them?

26:06.207 --> 26:09.010
Oh yes, yes, yes, I think so.

26:09.931 --> 26:20.985
In fact, I think it's fair to say that we've had a reputation all of my professional life of being the best of the best.

26:21.455 --> 26:26.700
We're pretty good in the technological areas, and we're pretty good in the design or the creative areas.

26:26.760 --> 26:36.068
And some schools tend to lean one way or the other, but we have a tradition, a history, pretty much going down between the two.

26:36.468 --> 26:40.111
And I think that's something I've taken a good deal of pride in.

26:41.052 --> 26:43.114
And I think we still do that to some degree.

26:44.135 --> 26:45.456
So you graduated when?

26:46.056 --> 26:47.557
Graduated in 57.

26:47.578 --> 26:50.500
57, and about how many of that...

26:51.982 --> 26:56.730
of your fellow freshman architecture majors were with you when you graduated?

26:58.613 --> 27:07.328
There were probably 15 in our class and at some point or another there were probably 50 in the class or something like that.

27:07.648 --> 27:08.890
Now you're not turning that off are you?

27:08.910 --> 27:11.194
I don't think I'm playing with this other side over here.

27:11.976 --> 27:15.762
So old architects like to talk about the attrition rate just being awful.

27:16.332 --> 27:26.764
But we had just begun with, the school had just begun with fiddling around with options sort of thing, different tracks, so that many of my classmates

27:27.503 --> 27:32.711
went into what was called the construction option at the time, which is now our Department of Construction Science.

27:33.572 --> 27:46.191
The first head of the Department of Construction Science, James Hyde Marsh III from Orange, Texas, was one of the people that had slid over into that construction science major, construction option at the time.

27:46.872 --> 27:55.165
Dick Vrooman, the sophomore design teacher, had the job of sorting us out at the end of the sophomore year.

27:55.583 --> 28:01.249
and saying you go to design, you go to construction, you go and design, you go in construction.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.555
And you know what we said when he said that?

28:07.296 --> 28:07.697
Yes sir.

28:08.958 --> 28:15.786
We didn't question it, we didn't get counseled about which is which or what it means or anything of the kind.

28:16.907 --> 28:18.469
For the design people,

28:19.090 --> 28:27.101
We thought it sort of meant that those other guys were basically being flunked out of the architecture program and put over into some secondary thing.

28:27.761 --> 28:33.108
But the fact is they have out-earned us by a factor of probably three over the years.

28:34.751 --> 28:39.597
It was a good field and a whole bunch of really good people went into that field.

28:40.808 --> 28:43.672
But design has always sort of been the king in architecture.

28:44.033 --> 28:45.955
The designer is the franchise player.

28:48.239 --> 28:52.525
So anyway, we didn't attrition like a lot of schools did.

28:53.045 --> 28:58.774
Many of the people that left our architecture program simply slid over into an optional program in our program.

29:00.736 --> 29:01.557
But we lost a few.

29:02.198 --> 29:02.839
We lost a few.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.483
So you graduated, and then what came next?

29:06.188 --> 29:13.721
Graduated and then I went to, when did I do the Army?

29:14.382 --> 29:21.093
Oh, I did the Army in 59 to 61, so I went and worked for a year someplace.

29:21.113 --> 29:29.968
59 to 61 then was in the United States Army stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas.

29:30.370 --> 29:31.591
Never left Texas.

29:32.492 --> 29:35.115
And that was part of your... One of the amazing things.

29:35.135 --> 29:36.736
Part of your carryover having been in the Corps?

29:36.816 --> 29:37.137
Yes.

29:37.797 --> 29:40.840
Because I was a commissioned officer at the time.

29:41.561 --> 29:53.032
And it was the first time this little Texas boy became aware of the fact that the people that came to Fort Bliss from California had traveled less distance than I had traveled from Port Arthur, Texas to get there.

29:53.512 --> 29:56.575
This was a 750 mile trip or something from Port Arthur.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.437
A long drive.

29:59.395 --> 30:01.718
But we did the Army thing.

30:01.738 --> 30:06.665
I'll talk about being prepared for things.

30:06.765 --> 30:11.792
I think we were better prepared for the Army than we were for architecture when we got out of Texas A&M.

30:12.573 --> 30:14.936
But we were actually pretty well prepared in both.

30:17.219 --> 30:19.723
I chose, I didn't choose anything in the Army.

30:19.783 --> 30:21.866
I just was assigned and went to the Army.

30:22.647 --> 30:25.791
I didn't try to opt out to go fly this or that.

30:26.446 --> 30:33.098
I didn't try to get into the Corps of Engineers, which where most people in this business sort of wanted to try to get into.

30:33.138 --> 30:46.682
However, the most successful people in our business today did their military career accidentally in the Surgeon, whatever the Medical Corps is in the Army.

30:46.882 --> 31:11.623
and and got involved with big hospitals and things like that and now they are commissioning big hospitals we're talking billion dollar hospitals now all over the world so that if a person if we look back in hindsight today say that's where you should have gone not the corps of engineers and wandering around out there in the mud building bridges or something but anyway I didn't do any of those things I just went into the into the regular army and and I sort of did it on purpose

31:11.603 --> 31:20.034
because I didn't want to be so directional, so much more architecture, architecture, architecture.

31:20.114 --> 31:21.116
I wanted to do something.

31:21.136 --> 31:26.443
If I was going to take it, let's do an opportunity, and I did, and I was in guided missiles, which was a really neat thing.

31:27.544 --> 31:30.388
We were doing computerized things before the computers were
