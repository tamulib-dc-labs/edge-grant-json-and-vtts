WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:04.519
A restaurant, but mostly a beer joint.

00:07.684 --> 00:08.566
Youngbloods?

00:09.588 --> 00:12.332
You know where you turn off to go to Kruger's?

00:12.352 --> 00:15.457
And it still was there when we were there.

00:15.517 --> 00:18.082
Not Youngbloods?

00:18.102 --> 00:20.045
I don't believe that's right.

00:20.065 --> 00:23.170
And what did you purchase there?

00:24.128 --> 00:24.609
What's that?

00:24.749 --> 00:25.792
What did you buy there?

00:26.553 --> 00:27.295
Mostly beer.

00:27.876 --> 00:28.818
We'd eat there, too.

00:28.959 --> 00:31.745
We'd got hamburgers or hot dogs.

00:31.805 --> 00:35.192
Now, how much beer did you veterans consume?

00:36.174 --> 00:37.116
Did you consume?

00:37.457 --> 00:42.087
That might be, I'd have to take Fifth Amendment on that.

00:43.906 --> 00:45.669
Oh, not very much.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.192
It's just a relaxation.

00:48.573 --> 00:52.218
And tell war stories and all kinds of things.

00:52.759 --> 00:55.844
We usually there were four or five of us that were kind of friends.

00:56.925 --> 00:58.628
Was Mr. Hardlicker's still?

00:58.668 --> 01:03.255
Hardlicker's, yeah, was there, yeah.

01:03.495 --> 01:08.002
Was Whiskey Bridge yet a reality, driving due west?

01:08.022 --> 01:09.143
That was a reality.

01:09.263 --> 01:13.069
I never did go over there, but yes, a lot of people did.

01:13.960 --> 01:18.527
The clothing was short.

01:19.148 --> 01:24.356
Do you remember when civilian goods became more available?

01:25.258 --> 01:39.360
Civilian goods, it started coming in to some sense of, you could obtain it, used somewhere about mid-'46, a little bit.

01:39.712 --> 01:48.563
You couldn't buy, you didn't have much selection, but you could buy some kind of a shirt and a pair of slacks, you know, and buy mid-46.

01:49.645 --> 02:02.100
And you had saved some money from the war, I presume, and then the GI Bill, but you paid your way, you and the GI Bill paid your way through entirely?

02:02.941 --> 02:03.822
Mom and Dad didn't?

02:04.563 --> 02:06.246
My mother and father couldn't have.

02:06.606 --> 02:07.407
They didn't have anything.

02:07.673 --> 02:08.734
They were doing well.

02:09.174 --> 02:15.039
I had a sister that's still at home, and they were doing well to keep the fires burning there.

02:15.079 --> 02:16.340
They didn't have any money.

02:17.081 --> 02:19.703
In fact, I helped them a little bit.

02:20.504 --> 02:30.252
I had a few hundred dollars that I'd saved while I was in the Southwest Pacific.

02:30.953 --> 02:36.938
I helped them, my father, to make a down payment on his farm.

02:37.846 --> 02:46.594
You did your studying, that night studying, in your room or in the library or where?

02:47.235 --> 02:49.337
A little of both, but mostly in our rooms.

02:49.897 --> 02:54.241
See, Willie Trahan and I were both veterinary students in the same class.

02:55.603 --> 02:58.005
And I think maybe we helped each other.

03:00.467 --> 03:05.372
We both finished in the top 10%, and I'm sure we helped each other.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.545
What did you wear to class?

03:08.585 --> 03:09.426
How did you dress?

03:10.267 --> 03:11.109
How did I dress?

03:11.850 --> 03:14.574
Whatever I could find to cover my neck in this.

03:17.078 --> 03:18.600
Do you wear sneakers?

03:21.445 --> 03:23.528
No, we didn't wear sneakers much.

03:23.708 --> 03:24.189
Blue jeans?

03:25.150 --> 03:26.653
No, we didn't wear blue jeans.

03:26.673 --> 03:32.642
We wore khakis and a pair of low-cut shoes.

03:33.162 --> 03:34.825
A simple shirt.

03:34.865 --> 03:39.233
We didn't, of course, dress up, but we stayed clean and presentable.

03:41.317 --> 03:49.112
Were you and your fellow veterinary students ever involved in any student pranks or jokes or good bull?

03:49.852 --> 03:59.942
No, I remember going in the night of the student march on Gilchrist's house.

04:00.083 --> 04:01.244
I remember going to that.

04:01.504 --> 04:04.047
Please describe that as fully as you can.

04:05.888 --> 04:06.629
What was that?

04:06.729 --> 04:07.310
Who was there?

04:07.410 --> 04:07.931
What happened?

04:10.794 --> 04:12.595
Oh, God, I haven't thought about it in 50 years.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.399
Well, there was a lot of unrest.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.082
I don't know where all the unrest was coming from.

04:19.568 --> 04:28.819
I think a lot of it was due to the fact that President Gilchrist was a poor communicator, very poor communicator.

04:30.041 --> 04:38.130
He didn't, as far as I know, communicate much through the battalion or that sort of thing.

04:38.751 --> 04:42.435
Didn't tell us why situations weren't like they were.

04:42.496 --> 04:47.922
And although none of it really pertained to me,

04:48.492 --> 04:58.964
I think it did to a lot of the married students because their housing was terrible, inadequate in most respects.

04:58.984 --> 05:07.815
And my best recollection is it should never have happened if the president would have helped.

05:09.337 --> 05:16.305
But he, I don't know why, he didn't understand what to do with those veteran students.

05:16.325 --> 05:18.027
And this march,

05:18.378 --> 05:21.062
went over to the president's house.

05:22.324 --> 05:23.986
Is it, it's after supper?

05:24.728 --> 05:27.912
It was late in the afternoon or after, I imagine it was after supper.

05:28.814 --> 05:31.758
And is the band there?

05:31.898 --> 05:33.140
Are there noise makers?

05:34.162 --> 05:44.738
There were just a lot of people that were kind of angry, you know, and they were, they were using pretty strong language and, you know, asking Gibb, get out here and tell us, meet with us.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.642
And I don't, maybe he finally did.

05:48.230 --> 05:51.455
Did some student try to speak for all the other students?

05:51.635 --> 05:52.998
Yeah.

05:53.138 --> 05:54.380
Most of us didn't know what to say.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.283
I wasn't unhappy.

05:57.004 --> 05:58.386
I didn't want to see what happened.

05:58.727 --> 06:00.910
What was the, what occurred?

06:01.050 --> 06:05.357
What was the end of the, what was the result of the meeting?

06:05.878 --> 06:14.592
The president, whoever was his assistants and so forth, made some adjustments, but they're mainly told the

06:15.196 --> 06:22.403
the students, why they didn't have everything they needed, why things were tough.

06:23.505 --> 06:33.275
Of course I don't know how to explain it because I really didn't understand it.

06:35.136 --> 06:40.562
I'm sure there must have been someone who understood that

06:40.863 --> 06:59.223
Here is a small campus, and it was a small campus at that time, and here you've got 10,000 students where you never had but 5,000 before, and you have no place to house them.

07:01.725 --> 07:08.513
But I can't really tell you why it was such a mess.

07:08.533 --> 07:09.874
It was a mess.

07:10.073 --> 07:18.245
Now, is this the meeting where some of the Corps seniors took off their brass and put it in the helmet liner and sent it up there?

07:18.886 --> 07:19.847
I expect it was.

07:19.947 --> 07:22.471
It seemed like I remember some talk of that.

07:23.553 --> 07:26.377
Now, the veterans didn't do anything like that.

07:27.879 --> 07:34.048
They just, of course, most of them wanted to just somehow or other survive to get the hell out of this place.

07:34.108 --> 07:36.992
That's what the usual answer you got.

07:37.512 --> 07:42.879
But I don't know why the Corps were so unhappy.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.722
I expect they were tired of the veterans.

07:45.403 --> 07:48.207
They were being pushed aside and crowded.

07:48.247 --> 07:49.348
I don't know.

07:49.949 --> 07:52.813
Where were the married veteran students living?

07:54.816 --> 08:00.684
They lived, well, of course, back around where the old project houses were, back south.

08:01.285 --> 08:07.013
And then there were some of them on the northeast side later on.

08:07.347 --> 08:13.695
So they moved in everything they could, some old army barracks.

08:14.737 --> 08:24.109
My brother, my sister and brother-in-law were there a year or so later, and they were living in, I think, what had been a mobile home kind of thing.

08:26.032 --> 08:28.575
And what did those wives do?

08:28.935 --> 08:30.377
They couldn't take classes.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.560
Did they work?

08:32.680 --> 08:36.325
Tried to work if they could find jobs, but that was the problem.

08:37.013 --> 09:05.232
And you have to remember, and I tell this story so much that Joy will probably leave because she won't want to hear it, but you remember the dorm that was across from Cebiza that had been built probably in the 30s and had a bath, and the bath was accessible from a

09:05.768 --> 09:09.252
a living room or a bedroom on one side or the other.

09:10.754 --> 09:17.543
Remember, most all of the dorms were a common type where they had one bathroom and showers and so forth.

09:17.563 --> 09:18.444
There were no women.

09:19.946 --> 09:24.192
And so they weren't satisfactory for married couples at all.

09:25.013 --> 09:31.641
But in this dorm that I'm speaking of, it was possible for them to

09:32.026 --> 09:36.292
put it in use in the fall of 45 and in the spring of 46.

09:38.195 --> 09:47.668
And one of the things that's kind of fun to remember about A&M then was that you never saw a woman.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.692
You didn't know really for sure what a woman looked like.

09:50.732 --> 09:55.579
But the only ones I ever saw had a great big swelling.

09:57.341 --> 10:01.527
This was, you know, just after the war ended.

10:01.945 --> 10:04.348
And everybody was starting a family.

10:05.129 --> 10:07.912
So we didn't see any women that weren't pregnant.

10:07.932 --> 10:10.676
I didn't know what one looked like for about a year.

10:12.097 --> 10:14.520
Did you have any social life that first year?

10:15.041 --> 10:16.002
Not much.

10:16.022 --> 10:17.664
No time for it anyway.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.449
No, first year virtually nothing.

10:21.649 --> 10:22.790
A little bit.

10:23.071 --> 10:27.676
Occasionally, you know, they'd have dances at Sibisa.

10:28.677 --> 10:30.079
And they would...

10:31.814 --> 10:43.612
they would invite women out of Fort Worth, Dallas, and Houston, and they'd come down on buses, or some of them that were more affluent would have their own cars.

10:45.195 --> 10:59.998
And so they would, a lot of the male students would have some access either to women in those cities or to TSCW, what it was called, the women's school in Denton.

11:01.733 --> 11:08.100
Well, of course, most of us didn't have any access to any of those, didn't have any addresses, telephone numbers or anything.

11:09.041 --> 11:17.891
But I recall one time that one of the older men that was in my class died a good many years ago, G.D.

11:17.931 --> 11:18.552
McLean.

11:19.613 --> 11:20.214
And G.D.

11:20.274 --> 11:30.846
was one of those wealthy guys, and his wife was a very positive socialite in

11:31.838 --> 11:44.419
in Dallas, and I think she was a graduate of SMU, and so she had gotten another young woman to come with her down.

11:46.001 --> 11:48.926
GD I don't think was married at that time, he did later.

11:50.228 --> 11:57.340
So this might have been the fall of 45, and we had one of the big bands, famous bands,

11:57.927 --> 12:07.046
He came to me and wanted to know if I would be the host for this young woman that was coming down.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.653
I tried to chicken out of that because I couldn't dance.

12:11.735 --> 12:18.349
I didn't have any of the social graces that I thought somebody out of SMU would have.

12:19.645 --> 12:21.167
And he wouldn't let me out of it.

12:21.187 --> 12:24.090
And I recall that was kind of a miserable weekend for me.

12:24.150 --> 12:28.315
And I'm sure that that young woman thought I was the biggest hick it ever was.

12:29.476 --> 12:31.338
But that's the kind of example.

12:31.919 --> 12:49.399
Do you recall any example of where the young undergraduates who had not gone away to the war, any examples of where they verbally put you old guys down

12:50.628 --> 13:00.019
Did they seem to have respect and gratitude for what you all had done during the role you played in the war?

13:00.039 --> 13:05.926
I think so, as much as you would expect a youngster, 18, 19-year-old to have.

13:07.327 --> 13:08.769
There was never any problem.

13:09.510 --> 13:12.113
In our class we had good relations.

13:12.153 --> 13:16.618
Some of the older men would tease those youngsters.

13:17.189 --> 13:22.197
In a good-natured way, I don't recall any problem at all.

13:22.277 --> 13:35.036
I find with today's undergraduates that they are astonished when I tell them that none of us who lived during World War II ever had any doubt as to who was gonna win the war.

13:36.719 --> 13:37.801
And they are surprised.

13:37.821 --> 13:42.287
You mean there wasn't great worry about the... And I said, no, everybody knew who was gonna win.

13:42.307 --> 13:44.631
It was just how long it would take.

13:44.864 --> 13:49.249
All right, when did you go, you got here in September, when did you go home the first time?

13:50.491 --> 13:52.994
Back to Stephenville?

13:53.014 --> 13:54.356
About Thanksgiving, I guess.

13:54.856 --> 13:56.899
And you didn't have a car, or did you keep that?

13:56.919 --> 13:59.202
I had, no, I didn't have a car at that time.

13:59.222 --> 14:00.884
All right, so you didn't?

14:01.285 --> 14:10.316
No, what happened, it would be, like, I grew up in Stephenville, and of course there were, it was kind of an Aggie town to be that far away.

14:10.656 --> 14:11.277
There were,

14:11.560 --> 14:14.905
A lot of, most of the kids were an engineer in their agriculture.

14:15.867 --> 14:25.662
And so there were, there was nearly always somebody going home for holidays, like Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter.

14:26.964 --> 14:30.970
Was it normal that if you rode with somebody that you paid a share of the gas?

14:31.771 --> 14:32.172
You did.

14:32.412 --> 14:36.098
You paid a share of the gas or gave him some money or something.

14:36.879 --> 14:36.979
Yeah.

14:36.999 --> 14:37.960
Did you ever hitchhike?

14:38.762 --> 14:39.002
Yeah.

14:39.151 --> 14:40.092
Oh, yeah.

14:40.192 --> 14:42.614
Make believe I'd never heard of Aggie hitchhiking.

14:42.654 --> 14:45.697
Tell me about where you caught a ride and how you did it.

14:46.598 --> 14:49.020
Where did you go at the campus?

14:49.060 --> 14:51.962
Where was the proper place to go get a ride to go in north?

14:51.982 --> 14:56.987
You know where university crosses college?

14:59.108 --> 15:06.375
There was a little more or less hitchhiking area there.

15:07.116 --> 15:08.837
And you go up there and

15:09.273 --> 15:18.747
Of course, what we would always do, though we were veterans, we were non-reg and non-core, we would wear military clothes.

15:20.169 --> 15:34.090
And if anybody came along that was going your way, of course that was the time when nobody was afraid to pick up a hitchhiker.

15:35.111 --> 15:36.934
Who got the ride first?

15:37.792 --> 15:44.682
Well, whoever, like if you went up there when there were half a dozen or a dozen people there, you kind of took the line.

15:46.725 --> 15:48.748
But if there were just one or two.

15:49.469 --> 16:02.668
But even after you got away from, sometimes you'd hitchhike into Brian, then you'd have to go out to Highway 6 for us going to Waco and on into Stephenville.

16:02.952 --> 16:05.736
So sometimes you catch three rides or so.

16:05.896 --> 16:09.581
Did you have any bad experience ever Aggie hitchhiking?

16:09.921 --> 16:17.090
No, but I was kind of, I have one experience that I recall, but I never had a bad experience.

16:18.232 --> 16:20.855
One Sunday afternoon, I was going back to College Station.

16:20.895 --> 16:24.600
I went down to highway, what we call the Heiko Highway.

16:24.980 --> 16:29.726
That was 273 or six was what it goes into Heiko.

16:30.107 --> 16:32.470
And then you get on six.

16:33.985 --> 16:36.189
And this fellow stopped.

16:36.350 --> 16:39.075
I hadn't been standing there but a couple minutes.

16:39.256 --> 16:43.765
And so he said, where are you going?

16:43.825 --> 16:49.676
I said, well, I'm going to College Station, but Waco's a good place if you're going anywhere in that direction.

16:49.837 --> 16:52.041
And he said, well, I'm going to Waco.

16:52.522 --> 16:54.947
So I got in the car with him.

16:55.417 --> 17:03.009
Well, I sat down there, and there was a .45 caliber pistol on it, laying by his right hand.

17:03.770 --> 17:12.784
And there was a sawed-off shotgun standing, you know, more or less on the dash, leaned against the dash.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.067
I don't know what in the world I'd gotten into, and I didn't say much.

17:19.089 --> 17:24.876
And he didn't talk very much, and finally we were pulling into Waco, and he said, I guess you want to know who I am.

17:24.916 --> 17:26.619
He said, I work for the state.

17:29.222 --> 17:32.827
So I guess he was a Texas Ranger, although he was not in uniform.

17:33.708 --> 17:37.152
Did you ever, I have not yet heard any description

17:37.604 --> 17:40.306
of a bad experience Aggie hitchhiking.

17:40.366 --> 17:41.688
Did you ever hear of anybody?

17:41.728 --> 17:44.550
Not in those days, I never, no.

17:45.131 --> 17:51.676
And it was, as I mentioned, if anybody had room and they were going your way, you had a ride.

17:52.297 --> 17:53.518
It was not difficult.

17:54.499 --> 18:01.325
And I've heard that you never, never, never tried to break the order.

18:02.045 --> 18:06.109
That if there are 20 people there, you're number 21 and rank doesn't matter.

18:06.528 --> 18:13.037
And I presume being a vet student didn't get you any advance rating?

18:13.417 --> 18:15.220
No, there was no one.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.502
It was an orderly thing.

18:16.522 --> 18:18.845
Of course, veterans were used to that.

18:19.406 --> 18:21.629
They'd spent their years in line.

18:23.671 --> 18:25.394
A line was just how you operated.

18:27.296 --> 18:27.777
Let's see.

18:29.519 --> 18:31.422
Back to classroom.

18:31.739 --> 18:41.880
How did you and your classmates, what were the expected unwritten rules of classroom conduct?

18:43.885 --> 18:45.909
How did you address a faculty member, for example?

18:47.252 --> 18:52.583
Oh, you always said Dr. Miller for doctors.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.624
Even Dr. Cruz.

18:56.006 --> 18:59.429
Nobody liked him putting it with Dr. Cruz.

18:59.449 --> 19:02.592
Do you remember ever slipping and using a nickname by accident?

19:03.353 --> 19:04.174
I never did.

19:04.995 --> 19:12.543
I know sometimes it would, as I mentioned to you, Dr. Jones, who was so proud of it.

19:12.563 --> 19:14.805
In fact, they called him Head End for the wrong reasons.

19:14.905 --> 19:21.692
But those were... I can tell you a little anecdote about...

19:22.364 --> 19:24.047
the chemistry teacher.

19:24.067 --> 19:26.270
Do you ever remember Dr. Hedges?

19:27.091 --> 19:27.813
Remember Dr. Hedges?

19:29.014 --> 19:32.860
Dr. Hedges, I don't know how or why, but he had a limp.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.823
He walked with a decided limp.

19:34.843 --> 19:37.808
Kind of almost stumbled along.

19:37.828 --> 19:44.839
And he took great pride in the fact that he thought that students did not cheat on him.

19:45.440 --> 19:45.981
They did not.

19:47.323 --> 19:48.625
So we had

19:48.892 --> 19:55.122
one of the final exams and one of the, I guess, chemistry 304 or something like that.

19:55.302 --> 19:58.387
It was a junior level course.

19:58.407 --> 20:14.092
And so that we took, we were sitting there, everybody was handed out the exam papers and we were all working mad like, and I never, you know, I never looked at, I didn't do any gazing around.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.536
I kept my eyes on my paper and I worked.

20:17.326 --> 20:29.048
But there was a boy up just all about three seats for me, and I noticed that he was doing something that was kind of ridiculous.

20:29.068 --> 20:31.653
He had a big old watch, you know.

20:33.737 --> 20:36.702
I don't know what they're called, little pocket watches.

20:37.019 --> 20:38.600
I can't recall the name of him.

20:39.621 --> 20:43.225
And he'd take it, watch it, and look at it, and stick it back in his pocket.

20:43.245 --> 20:47.509
Dr. Hedges watched him for a time, and he came around down in the back of him.

20:48.710 --> 20:57.758
And so, of course, this was the last exam, and he knew we was failing the course anyway.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.780
Well, we didn't know that, but he did.

21:01.441 --> 21:04.444
So toward the end of the period,

21:05.032 --> 21:08.495
He pulled that watch out and Dr. Hedges grabbed it, you know, like that.

21:11.077 --> 21:20.865
He had written on the face of the watch, I fooled you, you old son of a bitch, didn't I?

21:20.886 --> 21:23.888
Did that get read to the class or anything, I hope?

21:24.529 --> 21:25.489
My word got out.

21:25.509 --> 21:34.397
Needless to say, the boy didn't pass the course, but he knew he wasn't going to anyway, so.

21:34.782 --> 21:45.457
Let's see, in those days, did you have trouble finding one of your faculty, one of the instructors?

21:45.758 --> 21:48.622
Did you have trouble finding them outside of class?

21:48.842 --> 21:49.744
Were they available?

21:51.646 --> 22:03.203
They were not available as much as maybe that you would like because they were so busy, had such heavy loads.

22:03.740 --> 22:08.667
Yes, you could always find them if you worked at it.

22:09.388 --> 22:18.862
They'd be in their office certain hours, they'd have office hours or something, but... Did you have the impression they spent the entire day on campus?

22:19.663 --> 22:22.067
Well, I think they did, yes.

22:22.287 --> 22:23.669
Most of the time.

22:23.689 --> 22:24.991
All right, let's see.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.413
Extracurricular activities.

22:27.215 --> 22:32.903
Did the YMCA, did it have events in those days for students?

22:33.305 --> 22:33.725
The what?

22:34.186 --> 22:34.586
YMCA.

22:35.327 --> 22:36.228
Yeah, they did.

22:36.248 --> 22:37.429
They had a little bowling alley.

22:38.910 --> 22:50.280
And they had a few things there, but because they were so inundated with students, very few students took advantage of it.

22:50.720 --> 23:00.669
Of course, we had the theater, the movie, the old movie there that they just refurbished a few years before we left there.

23:00.689 --> 23:01.810
You're talking about Guy and Hall?

23:03.427 --> 23:03.807
The what?

23:04.168 --> 23:05.690
Are you talking about on campus?

23:05.710 --> 23:08.994
It's just across... Oh, the old campus theater.

23:09.014 --> 23:11.818
Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

23:11.838 --> 23:30.261
Now, if you and your buddies on campus wanted a break between class, where did you get a refreshment or coffee or a Coke or... In the fall of 45 or so, I don't know that I can remember there being any place.

23:31.523 --> 23:36.148
Let's see, did the typical veteran smoke?

23:37.549 --> 23:38.010
Some did.

23:38.550 --> 23:39.311
Some did, yeah.

23:39.671 --> 23:43.795
How would you compare the percentage then and now, as far as you know?

23:43.816 --> 23:45.978
I think there's a lot less smoke now.

23:46.738 --> 23:57.109
Men in that age category, I don't think they— Smoking was not really— no one really realized the danger then.

23:58.405 --> 24:04.030
I smoked just a little bit early in my military years.

24:05.092 --> 24:13.460
I recall one year, I'd only smoke if we went on pass or something.

24:14.541 --> 24:19.125
I remember just thinking, well, what am I doing this for?

24:19.426 --> 24:20.507
I don't get anything out of it.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.148
Well, I never learned to inhale it.

24:22.869 --> 24:25.051
So I never really did get anything out of it.

24:25.612 --> 24:27.113
That was the last of my smoking.

24:27.464 --> 24:34.815
Did you and your friends know about any other items to smoke other than tobacco?

24:36.537 --> 24:39.602
No, at that time, as far as I know, tobacco was out there.

24:39.622 --> 24:41.745
I had never heard about marijuana for years.

24:42.286 --> 24:44.689
Had you ever even heard the word cocaine?

24:45.771 --> 24:48.555
Yeah, we studied cocaine in pharmacology.

24:48.876 --> 24:49.657
Oh, sure, sure.

24:50.278 --> 24:55.986
But I never knew anything about anybody smoking the stuff or sniffing it or...

24:56.219 --> 24:58.981
taken by the interjection or anything.

24:59.001 --> 25:01.063
And heroin, didn't they?

25:01.083 --> 25:05.788
Yeah, we knew about heroin, but it was not on campus.

25:05.988 --> 25:09.511
I seriously doubt it was on campus.

25:10.552 --> 25:14.756
There were various events in Guyon Hall, movies and chapel.

25:15.336 --> 25:18.359
Did vet students go to any of those?

25:18.699 --> 25:20.901
In a limited way, yes, they did.

25:21.982 --> 25:25.365
Did you go to any religious activities on Sunday?

25:26.408 --> 25:29.832
Yes, I went to church quite a little bit.

25:30.012 --> 25:35.619
Went to the Baptist church there on just at the North Gate.

25:36.720 --> 25:41.125
I still remember the minister, Dr. Brown.

25:41.185 --> 25:43.568
He wasn't very popular with veterans.

25:45.590 --> 25:46.051
Why not?

25:47.693 --> 25:53.800
Oh, he gave a very cold and kind of a fire and brimstone sermon and

25:53.932 --> 25:57.637
And it was very old Baptist kind of thing, you know.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.802
And he didn't have any humor.

26:01.883 --> 26:03.706
He was short of charisma.

26:05.949 --> 26:10.416
I remember I never did get turned on by him much.

26:11.257 --> 26:13.881
All right, that first fall, did you go to any football games?

26:14.181 --> 26:14.401
Yeah.

26:14.722 --> 26:15.403
What were they like?

26:15.503 --> 26:20.530
Describe an Aggie football game to a youngster that had never seen one before.

26:23.716 --> 26:30.346
Well, I guess, think about it, I guess probably the first football, no, I'd seen football in high school.

26:30.387 --> 26:31.749
But you hadn't seen an Aggie game?

26:31.769 --> 26:34.353
No, no, no, no, no, I'd never seen an Aggie game.

26:34.373 --> 26:36.697
Describe what the impression it made on you.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.680
Well, quite a bit.

26:38.840 --> 26:43.768
I had a little trouble understanding why we were supposed to stand up old game.

26:44.950 --> 26:51.580
And, of course, I didn't get as carried away with all of the cheerleading and the football.

26:51.779 --> 27:00.971
yellow-laden in the folder all as much as some, but I enjoyed them and we didn't have a very good team.

27:00.991 --> 27:04.276
We had what everybody thought was going to be a good team.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.297
It was the Kitty Corps.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.579
You remember the Kitty Corps?

27:07.921 --> 27:20.638
Well, it turned out that the Kitty Corps, some of them were still carrying German shrapnel around in their legs and they couldn't run as fast as they had in 1943.

27:21.496 --> 27:25.141
So we didn't get off to a good start.

27:25.641 --> 27:30.628
And, of course, we had Coach Norton, Homer Norton.

27:31.509 --> 27:35.674
And Homer had been a good one.

27:35.754 --> 27:40.280
Of course, he's the only one for years that ever coached the national champions.

27:42.703 --> 27:46.588
But he couldn't get used to what was happening to his team either.

27:46.608 --> 27:51.334
The veterans, it must have been hard for the mature man to deal with them.

27:52.090 --> 28:07.359
I understand that one of the things to his credit, my source for this is Barney Welch, that he promised one-on-one every member of his teams who went away to the service, when you come back, you will have a scholarship.

28:08.541 --> 28:11.567
And Barney had the opinion that when they came back,

28:12.408 --> 28:23.440
many of them were not as good athletes as he could have gotten, but that he said to his knowledge, Coach Norton kept every one of those promises.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.123
I didn't know that, but I'm not surprised.

28:26.523 --> 28:27.684
I didn't know you knew Barney.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.867
Oh yes, oh yes.

28:30.488 --> 28:42.060
And then Jim Cashin told me that he was a quarterback and played as a freshman and then went away

28:42.850 --> 28:48.377
to the war and came back, and that he wasn't very good either, he said, when he came back.

28:50.139 --> 28:50.580
Let's see.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.462
Excuse me, do you know if Barney's still living?

28:52.482 --> 28:53.363
Barney Welch?

28:53.383 --> 28:53.483
Yeah.

28:53.503 --> 28:53.884
Oh, yeah.

28:53.904 --> 28:55.025
He's still living?

28:55.045 --> 28:56.207
I interviewed him about three months ago.

28:56.848 --> 28:57.468
Oh, doing well.

28:57.969 --> 28:59.811
If you see him, give him my regards.

28:59.831 --> 29:01.113
Oh, I will.

29:01.133 --> 29:01.494
I will.

29:01.834 --> 29:02.935
All right, let's see.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.217
Back to a football game.

29:04.417 --> 29:04.958
I'm sorry.

29:05.078 --> 29:09.383
Was there a, in those days, did the band march in?

29:10.405 --> 29:10.945
I believe so.

29:11.206 --> 29:11.626
Was it?

29:11.646 --> 29:14.050
Yeah, pretty much in a small way.

29:14.270 --> 29:17.134
And was the halftime by the band?

29:17.874 --> 29:19.416
Most of the time, yeah.

29:19.477 --> 29:20.538
That hadn't changed.

29:20.558 --> 29:20.958
Okay.

29:21.079 --> 29:21.559
I don't believe.

29:21.719 --> 29:23.081
Was there a midnight yell practice?

29:23.101 --> 29:23.322
Yeah.

29:24.163 --> 29:24.984
We went sometimes.

29:25.404 --> 29:26.446
Okay.

29:26.466 --> 29:29.850
What other traditional events do you remember?

29:30.792 --> 29:38.261
One of the most meaningful things I can remember were the ceremonies that they'd have for our deceased Aggies.

29:38.802 --> 29:39.863
Silver Taps.

29:39.943 --> 29:41.926
Silver Taps, yeah.

29:41.946 --> 29:47.493
And although you were not a lifetime undergraduate Aggie, you went to that?

29:47.513 --> 29:48.114
Oh, yeah.

29:48.134 --> 29:48.975
Did your buddies go?

29:49.656 --> 29:51.378
Most of them.

29:51.838 --> 29:59.668
We were not core Aggies, but very definitely Aggies, you know.

30:00.442 --> 30:03.246
just didn't have that core orientation.

30:03.266 --> 30:09.994
How long was it before you began to feel a real pride in being at that school?

30:11.657 --> 30:12.237
In being what?

30:12.317 --> 30:13.619
Being at that institution.

30:13.679 --> 30:16.062
Was it weeks, months?

30:16.663 --> 30:25.655
I think I felt a degree of pride in being able to be admitted to A&M and going there.

30:25.895 --> 30:28.879
These other traditional activities

30:29.332 --> 30:32.156
Do you remember a bonfire the first year?

30:32.276 --> 30:33.318
Was there a bonfire?

30:33.819 --> 30:36.142
Yeah, but it didn't used to be what it is.

30:37.184 --> 30:49.462
Now, they'd go down on the highway somewhere and pick up some old scrap lumber and bring it up, and they always could find somewhere, and there were a few outhouses then to put on the top of it.

30:50.123 --> 30:56.773
And the bonfire we had in 45 and 46,

30:57.783 --> 30:59.785
They weren't very big fires.

31:00.506 --> 31:02.088
And it was held on the drill field?

31:04.631 --> 31:05.532
Yeah, they were.

31:07.174 --> 31:09.417
Yeah, I think they were on the drill field at that time.

31:09.517 --> 31:10.458
I believe that's right.

31:10.478 --> 31:12.200
Do you remember going to a muster?

31:14.623 --> 31:15.404
Where was it held?

31:19.009 --> 31:20.871
Because the MSC wasn't finished yet.

31:21.543 --> 31:22.364
Was it on the Y?

31:23.145 --> 31:28.030
I guess in the Y or that Guyon Hall or somewhere.

31:30.092 --> 31:31.073
But I can remember.

31:31.153 --> 31:33.875
I don't know that I went in 46.

31:34.276 --> 31:36.758
Maybe it was 47 before I went to one.

31:37.099 --> 31:39.982
I don't recall for sure.

31:40.802 --> 31:44.967
Here's a question that I asked to some of the others.

31:45.347 --> 31:50.352
Were there any off-campus events that you remember where you were when

31:50.855 --> 31:53.119
and I mentioned Pearl Harbor and so forth.
