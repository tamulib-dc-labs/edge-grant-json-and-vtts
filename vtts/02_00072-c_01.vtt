00:03.018 --> 00:11.026
As I started to say, I view myself as a jack of many trades.

00:11.046 --> 00:17.073
Because when I got to A&M, my chief interest was in crustal seismology.

00:17.833 --> 00:22.358
But I got to A&M, and the first few years, I had to teach so many different courses.

00:23.840 --> 00:30.467
So I never became a superstar in any one field.

00:30.487 --> 00:31.928
And so I

00:32.600 --> 00:38.507
I did teaching every semester, and I did some research, and then, of course, I did some administration.

00:39.228 --> 00:50.442
I think I did them all fairly well, but I don't think if I had any regrets, I wish I could have been a better researcher.

00:50.482 --> 00:53.666
I had more time to be a better researcher.

00:55.087 --> 00:59.653
But that's where I stand at the moment.

01:00.950 --> 01:06.337
What were your personal guidelines for being a faculty member?

01:06.417 --> 01:11.184
What did you think were the rules that you should follow as a faculty member?

01:12.886 --> 01:22.840
Well, I had a professor actually at MIT.

01:24.422 --> 01:27.987
At the time, he was my

01:31.257 --> 01:34.541
did the teaching of geophysics, but he was still working on his PhD.

01:34.661 --> 01:37.785
It was in the infancy of geophysics.

01:37.805 --> 01:47.077
And I thought he was a remarkable individual in terms of his dedication to students, to teaching.

01:47.758 --> 01:50.982
My ethical background comes from my New England I'm in.

01:51.583 --> 01:55.628
I was brought up in the Depression.

01:59.270 --> 02:04.199
I was very fortunate, I think, in terms of my parents.

02:06.424 --> 02:17.945
I don't know whether this is appropriate, but my dad was the youngest of eight or ten children.

02:18.687 --> 02:20.350
He was born in this country.

02:21.781 --> 02:26.846
But all his other children had been born in Sweden.

02:26.866 --> 02:28.588
He met my mother in high school.

02:30.570 --> 02:34.013
An immigrant kid, really.

02:37.376 --> 02:39.218
World War I came along.

02:39.438 --> 02:40.900
He enlisted in the Navy.

02:42.041 --> 02:44.703
And then he got an appointment to the Naval Academy.

02:45.584 --> 02:47.586
And he finished his plebe year.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.353
And then his eyes were not up to snuff.

02:52.454 --> 02:53.255
He had to leave.

02:53.335 --> 02:55.598
He came back to Providence.

02:55.618 --> 02:58.943
And I think my mother wouldn't marry him until she made him go to college.

03:00.545 --> 03:02.127
I don't think he would have gone otherwise.

03:02.287 --> 03:03.950
He worked his way through college.

03:04.170 --> 03:05.732
He got a degree in engineering.

03:06.293 --> 03:15.025
And then he went back in 1923 and got a master's in geology when the engineering geologists didn't exist.

03:17.198 --> 03:24.528
So I grew up in a family that cared very much about education.

03:24.548 --> 03:38.967
And at the same time, my dad was a, brought up a Lutheran, became a Congregationalist, and certainly gave me a marvelous background, I feel.

03:41.330 --> 03:46.497
So in terms of my ethical decisions, it came from my parental background.

03:47.995 --> 03:48.997
Let's see.

03:49.057 --> 03:50.881
We may have skipped over.

03:50.921 --> 04:07.236
During the, after William's death, the presidents then, Jarvis Miller and Frank Vanderwer and so forth, are there any of those presidents that you think deserve special credit for the development in geosciences?

04:08.819 --> 04:13.187
I was not privy at those levels.

04:16.553 --> 04:20.960
Certainly, I didn't think much of the appointment of Jarvis Miller.

04:21.742 --> 04:26.991
For me, I would give the highest grades in what they meant to A&M.

04:27.872 --> 04:33.983
In my years, I would give the highest grades to Mr. Rutter for making the changes that only he could have made politically.

04:33.963 --> 04:38.860
and then for Jack Williams for building on that foundation academically.

04:38.880 --> 04:43.315
I would concur with you that certainly even though I

04:44.577 --> 05:03.283
I was opposed to dictatorial type of regime, I recognized that we, Rutter brought us into this, was able to make these changes and made the alums accept it, and we moved on from there.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.466
I mean, I think he was the person for his time.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.870
If he was president today, I would detest him.

05:09.231 --> 05:09.671
Oh, I agree.

05:09.952 --> 05:10.973
Jack Williams,

05:12.185 --> 05:19.984
As I already said, I really admired his position, his stance.

05:20.004 --> 05:22.830
I mean, the fact that he understood education.

05:24.454 --> 05:27.662
I'm appalled at times when I hear decisions

05:27.642 --> 05:30.566
our Board of Regents made.

05:30.926 --> 05:43.582
I mean, through the years, Clint Phillips has been a close friend, and so I occasionally was privy to some of the discouragements that he experienced.

05:46.225 --> 05:49.429
But I really didn't operate at that level.

05:49.690 --> 05:54.055
That's why I find your coffee group so interesting, because

05:55.520 --> 06:00.307
You, I don't know whether we should, I'm not saying anything negative.

06:00.507 --> 06:01.969
That's right.

06:01.989 --> 06:09.139
You are talking about administrative decisions at a level above the level that I operated at.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.365
And so I find some of these stories quite interesting.

06:14.326 --> 06:20.515
When Dr. Williams and Dr. Calhoun asked me if I was interested in an administrative position,

06:21.237 --> 06:30.052
I told both of them, yes, because I would like there to be a faculty viewpoint at the table where the decisions are made.

06:30.813 --> 06:40.851
I didn't mean to imply that they didn't have a faculty viewpoint, but I wanted to give what I thought was a faculty viewpoint there.

06:42.093 --> 06:46.941
Let's see, have you thought of any topics that we have not touched that we should?

06:50.262 --> 06:59.616
Well, I guess not really.

06:59.636 --> 07:14.640
I mean, I could recite stories about worrying about field trip from the dean's office viewpoint, worrying about these field trips that take off with students, with vans.

07:15.281 --> 07:16.202
Give an example.

07:17.566 --> 07:26.334
Well, I made one of these field trips with Dave Stearns, a two-week trip with our geophysics and geology students.

07:26.434 --> 07:39.026
And I can remember that, because we were using university vehicles, and they were supposed to have been maintained.

07:40.828 --> 07:41.588
What a laugh.

07:42.489 --> 07:46.493
I blew a tire by the time we got to Junction.

07:48.987 --> 08:01.083
Chris Mathewson and I, when we were in Fruita Valley, Colorado, working on the, taking the students through some of the geology on the Encompagre Plateau, very interesting area.

08:02.445 --> 08:07.592
Two of the vehicles, one was, you couldn't, you turn it off, but it continued to run.

08:08.153 --> 08:11.417
We took, Chris and I took two vehicles into the local

08:12.713 --> 08:22.622
I've forgotten whether they were Chevys, but we'll say they're Chevys, and to get them

08:23.412 --> 08:35.563
tuned up, and the mechanic, before our eyes, rebuilt one carburetor, one vehicle.

08:35.623 --> 08:39.267
The spark plugs were little nubs.

08:40.207 --> 08:42.389
It was clear that no maintenance had been done.

08:42.870 --> 08:52.879
And then you begin to wonder, because we're doing mountain driving, what about brakes and so forth and so on?

08:52.859 --> 08:56.283
That's pretty scary.

08:57.965 --> 09:07.917
And then you get a phone call from the Rangers at Arches Monument.

09:08.537 --> 09:11.181
Your faculty are being irresponsible here.

09:16.227 --> 09:19.170
During the late 80s,

09:19.893 --> 09:24.017
We had 400 student majors in geology.

09:24.738 --> 09:29.883
That was when the oil company was hiring anybody that came off the streets.

09:29.903 --> 09:40.373
We had some kids, or a couple of kids, that were inscribing their initials in the arches, you know.

09:43.075 --> 09:48.060
Or the kid that wandered over the dune at White Sands.

09:48.732 --> 09:56.431
And he's sort of myopic, and he was barefooted, and he lost his direction, and nobody worried about him.

09:57.273 --> 10:01.063
You know, this sort of stuff, after all.

10:01.324 --> 10:02.426
Never a dull moment.

10:02.747 --> 10:04.311
Well, I mean, yeah, right.

10:05.303 --> 10:05.944
Let's see.

10:06.224 --> 10:08.248
Let's kind of draw this to a close.

10:09.089 --> 10:13.135
I have only two or three other things.

10:13.977 --> 10:30.923
One is to urge you, if you have any A&M-related papers, letters, memorabilia, any kind of papers that you ever want to dispose of,

10:30.903 --> 10:34.787
I beg you, please put them in the A&M archives so they would be there forever.

10:36.329 --> 10:48.083
Don't throw them away, and if you're going to pass them on to any other organization, since the A&M was the place for your career, that would be the best place.

10:48.884 --> 11:00.437
Then the next one is, let's make believe that someone comes up to you in the next few days and gives you a check for a million dollars, and there's only one condition to the check.

11:00.417 --> 11:05.662
you must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide what use they would make of the money.

11:06.743 --> 11:12.549
If you had a million dollars you could give Texas A&M, what would you most want them to use the money to do?

11:15.172 --> 11:16.653
You want me to answer that right now?

11:19.496 --> 11:25.682
I would like it to go into the College of Geoscience,

11:26.253 --> 11:53.137
And I would like it to put together a comprehensive undergraduate support facility for the undergraduate students in the college that would have the available technology so that they could review lectures, would have a support staff that could counsel with students in their first one or two years.

11:54.238 --> 11:56.260
I think that's what I would do with it.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.863
All right, then the last question.

11:59.005 --> 12:02.931
At this time in your life, what feelings do you have about Texas A&M?

12:06.296 --> 12:07.438
I have warm feelings.

12:12.426 --> 12:16.493
I think in terms of university,

12:19.004 --> 12:19.726
Loyalty.

12:20.628 --> 12:24.817
My first loyalty would be to MIT, not to my undergraduate school.

12:26.161 --> 12:29.608
I had a marvelous experience at MIT Woods Hole.

12:30.891 --> 12:33.317
I've had some marvelous experiences here.

12:34.327 --> 12:44.720
Three of my children have graduated with bachelor's degrees from A&M, and two of them have masters from here.

12:44.740 --> 12:53.831
A fourth one quit after 80 hours in the business school with close to a B average.

12:54.532 --> 12:58.396
So, you know, I've seen this place grow.

12:59.618 --> 13:01.380
What I have not

13:01.934 --> 13:13.851
been able to accept is the growth has come so fast that we have not, the campus has not been able to absorb

13:14.185 --> 13:23.478
And the cultural accoutrements that go along with this have not come back to A&M.

13:23.498 --> 13:30.348
And so I'll stay here in this community.

13:30.869 --> 13:35.796
I still actively serve in a couple committees on campus.

13:38.721 --> 13:43.888
I think it's a good school, but I think it could be so much better.

13:44.611 --> 13:47.497
I guess that's what I'm saying, academically.

13:49.020 --> 14:00.444
I am just semi-appalled at the fact that so much of the dollars that come to the school are attracted by athletics.

14:02.588 --> 14:04.813
I look at the Bryant Eagle.

14:05.198 --> 14:10.712
in football season and every day in the week they feature one football star.

14:11.474 --> 14:19.174
Why couldn't the Eagle feature one scholar every day for 365 days a year?

14:20.251 --> 14:36.808
I think probably that's because I was raised in an Ivy League atmosphere where athletics was not the end all, it was part of the activities.
