WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:11.898
gives you a million dollar check and you can do 
anything you want to with it except you must give it

00:02.984 --> 00:11.898
to Texas A&M but you get to decide what they do with 
the million dollars. If you had a million dollars

00:13.821 --> 00:17.707
you could give to them, what would you want A&M to do 
with it? What would be your favorite cause?

00:28.264 --> 00:28.705
Well,

00:36.599 --> 00:49.218
I would

00:36.599 --> 00:49.218
give half of it right offhand, half of it to a 
scholarship fund. And

00:51.221 --> 01:04.260
not,

00:51.221 --> 01:04.260
you're going to think this is not good, but I 
wouldn't, I don't necessarily want that

01:04.949 --> 01:07.853
scholarship based on need. If you want to figure a 
little bit of need in, I don't want that to

01:09.616 --> 01:17.308
disqualify anybody or qualify anybody. 
Hopefully... How would they pick the recipients?

01:23.878 --> 01:26.282
That they pick the recipient by... a deserving 
person and not

01:27.443 --> 01:45.361
somebody that has a genuine desire to learn and to 
be good for humanity.

01:46.622 --> 01:47.523
What about the other half? And the other half, and 
this sounds awfully bad because of my son's recent

01:56.873 --> 02:01.958
But I've been active for many years in the 
association. I'd give the other to the

02:03.640 --> 02:14.870
association as unrestricted funds. Okay. And 
they would probably take a goodly amount of it and

02:15.671 --> 02:24.720
place it into the

02:15.671 --> 02:24.720
foundation. which is completely really 
controlled by the former students. But I've let

02:30.714 --> 02:44.229
them have a backlog to do so many things that the 
association has to do. And this has been a

02:44.289 --> 02:54.640
feeling of mine for a long time.

02:58.062 --> 03:02.329
I hate to say this because they're all worthy. The 
College of Veterinary Medicine, the College of

03:03.450 --> 03:24.863
Engineering, the

03:03.450 --> 03:24.863
College of Geosciences, all of the different 
colleges, they're all deserving. and the Corps

03:27.104 --> 03:34.072
cadets and everything, and God knows I love the 
Corps. But

03:36.315 --> 03:47.047
the association has supported all of these things 
for so many years, they get no credit for it. Which

03:48.609 --> 03:55.677
they're not really looking for credit, but they, 
now all of these, outfits are going on separate

03:55.876 --> 04:10.574
fundraising ventures and even so they still 
expect the support of the association. And

04:10.594 --> 04:17.583
somehow this has to be worked out amicably. Last 
question. What feelings do you hold in your heart

04:21.307 --> 04:25.777
now for Texas A&M?

04:31.551 --> 04:35.239
I love it.

04:35.259 --> 04:36.502
That's about all I can say. I love it.
