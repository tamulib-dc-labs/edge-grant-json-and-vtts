WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:13.890
What about some highlights or some insights, 
observations, or something that stands out as

00:01.786 --> 00:13.890
biggies during your time here? One thing that 
would stand out would be in the mid-70s.

00:23.605 --> 00:30.955
We, Teacher Education in Texas, have been 
operating under the 1955 English for Teachers

00:23.605 --> 00:30.955
certification. It's in 55. It works with no 
change. Well, it's a modification. But

00:36.163 --> 00:37.865
basically, the standards have been in place. 
During the early 1970s, we went through this

00:38.686 --> 00:45.616
competency-based JABS and different kinds of 
things. And there was a lot of disagreement in the

00:45.636 --> 00:53.427
state between the among institutions and so 
forth. and they couldn't agree upon a set of

00:54.031 --> 00:57.876
standards. And actually, it got to the point where 
they said, okay, institution, you can choose from

00:57.896 --> 01:07.328
75 standards or, I think, 74 standards or 
whatever. Well, shortly after that, we went

01:07.549 --> 01:14.998
through our accreditation period with UVA. Since 
the early 70s, like about 72, we had half a semester

01:15.018 --> 01:21.427
required. The 1955 standards said had to be a 
minimum of six hours. That is, a half a day all

01:29.009 --> 01:34.156
semester or all day for half a semester. Well, ours 
has been virtually twice that.

01:42.167 --> 01:52.742
The GEA comes in and tells us that we won't be 
accredited because our student keeps, you know,

01:42.167 --> 01:52.742
blew us away.

01:55.068 --> 01:56.570
So we chose to go to the mat. And of course, if we 
don't meet the minimums, where do you come off

01:58.092 --> 02:02.919
telling us? Well, the TEA's interpretation of 
that was that the attorney general said that you

02:03.580 --> 02:09.909
must have a minimum program.

02:14.375 --> 02:24.349
And so there was a whole series of letters that went 
back and forth from Dean Hubert to Commissioner

02:14.375 --> 02:24.349
Edgar and other parties. And finally, my 
perception is that TDA, rather than put

02:25.257 --> 02:46.358
themselves up for encouraging minimum 
standards, plus rather than fight Texas A&M, they

02:25.257 --> 02:46.358
just chose to ignore it. And so the next time that 
they came for a accreditation visit, they didn't

02:46.378 --> 02:50.482
even look at that. So they didn't have to write up . 
Now, as an aside, there's no question that Dr.

02:56.037 --> 03:04.306
Huber's personal relationship with J.W. Edgar, 
I'll try to write that up, but J.W. Edgar and Dean

03:08.611 --> 03:11.974
Huber went back 100 years. So that was Alton Bowen. 
Alton Bowen became Commissioner of Education

03:14.998 --> 03:18.201
after J.W. Edgar. Well, as it so happened, Alton 
Bowen went to the Commissioner's office the

03:25.450 --> 03:28.954
superintendency at the Mahea schools. Prior to 
Mahea, he had been the superintendent. No, he went

03:31.817 --> 03:35.742
from there. Anyway, early on, early 70s, Alton 
Boyd was superintendent of the schools for Brian.

03:42.710 --> 03:53.702
You know, the cronies in public education during 
the 60s and the 70s, in the real behind-the-scenes

03:42.710 --> 03:53.702
movers and shakers, You look at . And then you had 
another guy over at UT who, early on in the 50s and

03:56.040 --> 04:10.356
60s, was Professor of UT. OK, now one of the things 
that I haven't touched on, I keep forgetting to ask

04:10.537 --> 04:18.686
some of the people, but two or three have mentioned 
it, is the role of the development council. And I

04:18.746 --> 04:24.533
know you work very, very closely with the council 
in establishing some of the programs. you know,

04:24.884 --> 04:37.759
that you feel, you know, was the, and again, you 
know, forgetting the development council, but

04:24.884 --> 04:37.759
the way that, well, I'm not saying this is your 
honor, but really, has that had any kind of an

04:24.884 --> 04:37.759
impact on the? Oh, absolutely. Okay. Absolutely. 
If you look at six years ago in college of

04:41.924 --> 04:54.059
education, we virtually had no funding for 
scholarships at the undergraduate level. Okay.

04:55.259 --> 04:58.183
that were dollars controlled by the College of 
Education. Our kids could compete at the

04:58.203 --> 05:07.155
university level with university-wide 
scholarships, but we had no undergraduate

04:58.203 --> 05:07.155
dollars available. Just in those six short years, 
primarily through the Development Council, we

05:07.175 --> 05:21.233
have over a million dollars that are available to 
kids in scholarships now, directly to College of

05:07.175 --> 05:21.233
Education kids. To me, and obviously, since I 
focus on undergraduate efforts, that has been a

05:21.449 --> 05:35.988
major accomplishment that we could not have done 
without the . It's Friday the 13th. Do you have a

05:39.292 --> 05:46.521
crystal ball that might tell you where you're 
going to be on Friday the 13th of the 21st century

05:39.292 --> 05:46.521
sometime? Where do you see the future for this 
college at this point from where you're sitting? I

05:52.364 --> 06:01.839
think that depends on where education is in the 
state. I see some major, I see the potential for a

06:01.859 --> 06:20.447
major conflict between policy makers at the state 
level, here I'm talking about the state board, the

06:01.859 --> 06:20.447
coordinating board, potential legislators, 
major potential conflict between perception of

06:21.440 --> 06:41.720
what is and what is not right with education and old 
and other profession in meeting those needs, how

06:21.440 --> 06:41.720
those perceived needs should be addressed. The 
realization of education really bothers me

06:41.740 --> 06:48.207
because We could very easily, in fact, we're 
almost at that point, close to the point of, as a

06:49.773 --> 07:17.940
profession, losing any kind of control or input as 
to what, you know, I think a lot of it is based on

06:49.773 --> 07:17.940
education is one of our societal institutions 
that everybody has been through, everybody has

06:49.773 --> 07:17.940
experienced.

07:20.047 --> 07:44.284
there is not only a tendency, but there is little 
effort to learn about or to acquire or to believe in

07:20.047 --> 07:44.284
the social science research

07:20.047 --> 07:44.284
and education research as a basis for 
policymaking.

07:45.025 --> 07:48.130
This is because it's not directly cause and effect 
kind

07:49.274 --> 07:56.422
of stuff. And you cannot quantify it in such a way 
that lends itself to those kinds of things. I think

08:07.955 --> 08:18.927
the ability or the lack or the willingness of the 
professional education community to get

08:07.955 --> 08:18.927
involved in politics. And I've got a theory on 
this, but that's outside what you're doing. Well,

08:24.021 --> 08:27.285
I think I know what you're saying about it, too. 
Kind of an apathetic type, you know, you can't do

08:28.387 --> 08:49.555
anything other than... Well, that, and I think 
teachers as a general rule, educators as a general

08:28.387 --> 08:49.555
rule, that if, and this is stereotypical, but I 
think educators as a general rule, one of the

08:28.387 --> 08:49.555
reasons that they go into education, because of 
their personality makeup as such, that they're

08:50.142 --> 09:02.296
not the hard-driving, competitive, beat the 
other guy, win this business deal kind of folks.

09:02.336 --> 09:09.384
They're more the socially-oriented, health, 
consciousness kind of thing. And because of that,

09:10.665 --> 09:19.575
are not comfortable, whether they go through any 
kind of a program or any kind of experiential deal,

09:20.230 --> 09:44.984
that makes them politically sensitive, they get 
into their classroom, which is a very isolated

09:20.230 --> 09:44.984
environment, and time marches by, and as early on, 
when maybe they still have a little bit of idealism

09:20.230 --> 09:44.984
or what have you, they'll buck the system a little 
bit or push on the issue or what have you, and they

09:20.230 --> 09:44.984
get slapped down. They get slapped down from the 
administrators because the administrators were

09:47.804 --> 09:50.807
in the same boat that they were before. That's what 
happened to them. They don't know how to deal with

09:52.609 --> 09:57.755
somebody who has got some new ideas or some 
creative things. They want to line all these

09:57.795 --> 10:09.347
things up because whenever you increase a 
person's degrees of freedom, then that means your

09:57.795 --> 10:09.347
management task is more difficult. See, what you 
want to do is control them. You want to pack them in

10:12.982 --> 10:16.627
little boxes and keep them in those boxes. And that 
is a reinforcing kind of thing because when you're

10:17.208 --> 10:33.051
dealing with kids, you have to do that because 
degrees of freedom have to be related to level of

10:17.208 --> 10:33.051
maturity. And so while your teachers and your 
administrators are suffering from the

10:33.432 --> 10:42.465
environment in which they find themselves, So 
none of this works together. It works against

10:44.218 --> 10:48.462
teachers and administrators being politically 
active. Is it as much in the higher education? I

10:51.405 --> 10:56.749
mean, how high is it different between higher ed 
and the special ed? The mindset's totally

10:56.769 --> 10:58.231
different. Totally different. Because in higher 
education,

11:02.134 --> 11:11.963
in a major institution like this, it has to be 
different. In fact, you have to encourage

11:12.652 --> 11:15.937
creativity. You have to encourage differences. 
And I have seen a lot of people come and go, your

11:19.723 --> 11:40.836
folks who've been in business or military who 
those degrees of freedom and don't know how to

11:19.723 --> 11:40.836
manage action of individual faculty who have 
their own agenda and who should have their own

11:19.723 --> 11:40.836
agenda. But how do you get the department to move 
collectively in this direction when you've got

11:42.149 --> 11:54.607
all these folks doing all this? It's a very 
delicate task. But as soon as you change that

11:57.351 --> 12:07.465
assumption that my job as administrator is to line 
everybody up and march them down the road, you've

11:57.351 --> 12:07.465
lost it. or department, or whatever, is on the 
decline. Exactly. One of the reasons I picked up on

12:15.174 --> 12:29.708
one of the papers I wrote looking at this 
organization was, are the people in the

12:15.174 --> 12:29.708
organization more loyal, are more people tending 
to be more loyal to the profession or to this

12:15.174 --> 12:29.708
organization? Or maybe fashion add to 
themselves. That is the old classic argument. I

12:37.870 --> 12:47.500
refer you to AMA Journal, something 1955.

12:51.363 --> 12:56.428
Anyway, the argument is the terminology is 
cosmopolitan versus local. Cosmopolitan is that

12:57.329 --> 13:03.135
faculty person who puts his or her discipline 
before the institution. And there's never been

13:03.588 --> 13:05.850
any? Oh, it's a continuing part. And A&M is 
probably, as a whole, the college to some degree,

13:10.815 --> 13:19.904
and it goes back to that first issue you were 
talking about, recognizing that you need both

13:10.815 --> 13:19.904
kinds of folks. And you can't do all of what a 
college or a university needs to do with all kinds

13:20.384 --> 13:32.616
of politics, because then you have no commonality 
of values to drive an institution. if you have all

13:34.115 --> 13:57.017
locals then you have no you know you have little 
creativity you have little folks looking at

13:34.115 --> 13:57.017
things all together differently so again there's 
that balance in there and that's all part of the

13:34.115 --> 13:57.017
culture oh absolutely absolutely it's a classic 
study in there what about the climate i mean has it

13:34.115 --> 13:57.017
changed does it affect is every floor on this 
building you know each have its own total, because

13:57.368 --> 14:04.195
it's part of the big culture, but do they have just a 
total different climate? Oh, absolutely. It's

14:04.535 --> 14:05.516
just like every class you have is different. You 
can ask this question. I'm not sure how I'd want you

14:06.557 --> 14:12.163
to write it, but I'll pick this up. The leadership 
styles between Hoover and Corrigan, it's

14:12.183 --> 14:20.752
actually 180 degrees.

14:22.954 --> 14:26.177
I've heard lots of different Autocratic, 
dictatorial, that I've heard every one of them.

14:29.769 --> 14:33.673
There was a dictatorial perception, but I never 
saw him. It was a

14:33.793 --> 14:39.600
needed autocraticness. Because I go back to, we 
were in that dramatic period of growth. And when

14:46.969 --> 14:54.257
you're in that kind of a mode, you've got to 
maintain a little bit closer handle on things. in

14:54.895 --> 14:59.463
order to have some continuity, in order to pull 
things together. But yet, I keep hearing, too, a

14:59.483 --> 15:02.228
lot of the humanistic. Oh, absolutely. And a lot of 
that. And that's interesting to see how everybody

15:03.811 --> 15:07.678
perceives that. I'll never forget. I was in there 
working one day, and he walks in. He has this box. He

15:16.853 --> 15:18.676
says, Brian, I thought Keith would like this. He's 
got a clean building. It's a rock tumbler. It's all

15:21.740 --> 15:27.849
the different powders and everything for that. 
Those kinds of things. He walks in another day. I'm

15:31.935 --> 15:33.618
hearing a lot of that. He said, I just read these, 
and I thought you would love to have them. Oh,

15:40.588 --> 15:41.450
that's Vandiver's? Yeah, these are Vandiver's 
books. This was before Vandiver was here. Yeah.

15:45.925 --> 15:49.270
getting that little note. See, I'm seeing and 
hearing a lot of this. And it's a side that maybe

15:52.856 --> 15:57.444
some people that didn't know him intimately would 
not have known. They would have picked up only on

15:57.464 --> 16:01.951
this, you know, the strength and so forth. Well, 
and things like when J.W. Edgar retired, I hear

16:05.056 --> 16:08.562
that the man was brave. When J.W. Edgar retired, 
retired as commissioner of education in 50 some

16:11.508 --> 16:19.858
odd years of service to the state of Texas. Hubert 
goes over to JW's farm somewhere outside of

16:19.878 --> 16:25.544
Austin. And there's an old dilapidated, no, it 
goes to his home place where he was born. And he goes

16:33.473 --> 16:41.042
off from the old home place, apparently 
dilapidated, just pretty well run down. The wood

16:42.288 --> 17:07.165
whitens and takes some planks from that, has a 
frame, has a picture of the old home place drawn up,

16:42.288 --> 17:07.165
frames the picture in those pieces of wood from his 
old four-year-old home place. We had a

17:07.448 --> 17:22.709
person from New Mexico who was one of the greatest 
turquoise artists in the world. Dean brings him in

17:22.729 --> 17:30.820
as a part of Joanne Moore's classes in industrial 
arts, jewelry making and so forth. Makes a big deal

17:31.061 --> 17:34.025
of it and so forth. And as this guy's gift, The dean 
has gone out and found some different kinds of corn

17:37.030 --> 17:42.899
seeds. Now, one would think that might be 
stereotypical or ethnic-related or whatever,

17:44.802 --> 17:56.982
but rather it demonstrated a sensitivity to how 
this person would appreciate that. And I saw that

17:58.464 --> 18:02.510
kind of thing time and time and time again. And I'm 
hearing a lot of that. And also by contrast, you

18:03.912 --> 18:22.434
know, and because you have said that the English 
and South are so different, I have even heard some

18:03.912 --> 18:22.434
extremes, you know, and of course, this Dean's 
high visibility and his reputation nationwide

18:03.912 --> 18:22.434
and what it's done for the college and all, a lot of 
people have alluded to that. But also on him, some

18:22.454 --> 18:28.862
of the loosely coupled or the looseness of it. You 
want to quote? I've even heard sloppy. You want to

18:31.825 --> 18:32.766
quote? Yeah. I

18:33.680 --> 18:39.107
hadn't heard it that way. Okay. And what that means 
is...

18:41.310 --> 18:47.158
Whose quote is that? It's the dean's. Oh, okay.

18:51.164 --> 18:51.724
Of himself? Well, I think so, of his leadership 
style. Okay. I would want you to use that. That's my

18:58.687 --> 18:59.748
perception. No, no. This is just to get a framework 
of everything is what I need all of this for. In

19:06.615 --> 19:13.102
terms of letting the faculty do what they want to 
do. He's not a believer of telling people what to

19:13.262 --> 19:17.707
do. In order for it to happen, it's got to come up 
from the bottom. He's very much a bottom-up. He's

19:22.171 --> 19:23.332
not a top-down. Hubert was a top-down guy. But 
within that, There was latitude for bottom-up.

19:31.153 --> 19:32.254
Okay. And that's it? About the decision-making, 
I'm hearing also that you have a big

19:35.598 --> 19:44.488
responsibility in college for a lot of the 
decision-making. Is that accurate? Well, it's an

19:46.911 --> 19:51.457
issue. Okay. And it takes my recommendation. 
There are lots of times it doesn't take my

19:57.079 --> 20:06.289
recommendation. I want Chris or David or me or the 
department to be yes people. And I want a degree

20:10.093 --> 20:13.917
with him because he's a human. You can. And, you 
know, I look at my role as having responsibility

20:14.378 --> 20:19.523
and telling him what I think is right and why. And 
sometimes he agrees with it, and sometimes he

20:20.195 --> 20:24.941
doesn't. Yeah, I've been fortunate to see a lot of 
things that I think would be good. Is there one

20:28.665 --> 20:43.923
little final anecdote or observation or 
something that was, you know, a little short for

20:28.665 --> 20:43.923
the thing that you can think back on as being a 
puppy? Well, I think one thing, it had to be more of a

20:45.385 --> 20:49.830
today is, to

20:52.072 --> 21:05.969
the major contributing factors to where 
education is today as opposed to where it was 15,

20:52.072 --> 21:05.969
17, 18. It's the kinds of kids we had every day they 
were yesterday, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

21:10.995 --> 21:17.623
It's just been the benefit of Texas A&M in general 
in that regard because there's all kinds of

21:10.995 --> 21:17.623
research called needs-impressed research. to 
college climate and that kids tend to choose that

21:18.042 --> 21:30.798
kind of institution if they proceed and choose 
baggage police and that kind of thing.

21:30.818 --> 21:40.951
Everybody's very reluctant to answer this 
question, but do you feel, I hope you're going to be

21:30.818 --> 21:40.951
here forever and ever, but if you ever leave here, 
what would you like to be remembered by? What do you

21:41.011 --> 21:43.594
think has been your biggest contribution?

21:46.021 --> 21:50.627
Everybody wants somebody else to talk about it, 
and people have it, and I have gotten it from

21:46.021 --> 21:50.627
different people. I would like to think that there 
were a lot

21:51.448 --> 22:02.524
of, excuse me, Barbara. Like who? Barbara. Oh, 
okay. Who graduated last May, after six years,

22:05.428 --> 22:14.340
seven years. I could

22:16.261 --> 22:26.694
think I have a hand in helping the Baylor College of 
Medicine. Drop by at graduation time or drop me a

22:26.714 --> 22:30.018
little note or come by. There's many that might not 
take the time to do that, but you know you touched

22:30.458 --> 22:34.663
them. That's why I think about teaching. You never 
really see it. That's why I'm here. That's what I'd

22:41.652 --> 22:44.175
like to do. There are kids out there that are more 
than they thought they could be because, you know,

22:44.780 --> 23:01.257
understanding their situations and didn't just 
shut them out. Well, I thank you very, very much for

23:01.337 --> 23:08.524
your interview and a long time at the end of the day 
on Friday the 13th. I really appreciate it, and I

23:08.685 --> 23:11.007
hope you'll let me come back.
