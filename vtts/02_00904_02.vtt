WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:10.930
centralized planning functions for the state and 
to assist communities were dismantled by the

00:01.820 --> 00:10.930
succeeding governor. Who was? Who was? Who was the 
next governor? Dolph, the evaporative. Dolph

00:16.917 --> 00:17.878
Briscoe. Right, Dolph Briscoe, who spent very 
little time being governor and apparently was

00:18.179 --> 00:24.927
anti-planning. He certainly put together an 
anti-planning staff. They

00:33.494 --> 00:38.901
They also had some very undemocratic procedures 
that they followed. I'm afraid it was very much of

00:40.022 --> 00:46.831
the era of the old-time Texans, wherein you did 
what you wanted with your stuff. They had a very

00:47.432 --> 00:55.502
difficult time understanding that the federal 
government had guidelines for the use of money

00:47.432 --> 00:55.502
that people received from the federal 
government. At any rate, I'm going to get through

00:56.849 --> 01:04.497
the rest of my personal history kind of quickly so 
we can talk about whatever else we need to talk

00:56.849 --> 01:04.497
about planning. After I left Newhouse and Taylor, 
I went to work with Carter Otscott, and the

01:05.489 --> 01:16.181
planning that I did there was split into two sorts 
of things. I did do a couple of comprehensive plans

01:17.122 --> 01:27.695
that they sort of had left over from the days when 
they thought that there was a value in the 701

01:17.122 --> 01:27.695
program and still had a commitment to finish up. 
They were at that point doing an enormous amount of

01:35.594 --> 01:40.241
campus planning for major universities, which 
are sort of a microcosm. They're an interesting

01:40.261 --> 01:46.110
blend between a company town and a dictatorship.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.397
Campuses are a dictatorship? Certainly are. And 
who's the dictator varies a great deal from campus

01:52.540 --> 02:00.252
to campus.

02:01.784 --> 02:05.789
At any rate, the campus plans were very 
interesting. They involved the communities into

02:06.229 --> 02:11.275
them, some more than others. We wanted to do the 
total thing together wherever it was possible to

02:12.056 --> 02:16.862
do that. And

02:16.902 --> 02:26.593
then a lot of planning oriented to large-scale 
architectural projects.

02:27.991 --> 02:30.935
some of which were the equivalent of cities in 
themselves. In some cases, I spent three or four

02:31.555 --> 02:45.593
days being the consultant to something that was 
going to have a major impact on some city, a giant

02:31.555 --> 02:45.593
new hospital complex, for instance. But at any 
rate, I spent five or six years working there and

02:45.613 --> 02:55.045
then joined Bernstaff.

02:55.683 --> 03:09.194
I guess the other thing, the one thing that Vernon 
would like to mention was that he was president of

02:55.683 --> 03:09.194
the Gulf of Southwest chapter of AIP, which has now 
been merged into APA. He was president when I

03:09.435 --> 03:13.758
arrived in Texas in 1969, as I recall. He probably 
was. Yes. He had been the Houston section

03:15.900 --> 03:17.662
director. I've been the Houston section 
director. I've been president of the Texas

03:19.863 --> 03:22.526
chapter of AIP. I was also an officer in CPAP. which 
is confined to people who are employed by cities in

03:25.568 --> 03:33.600
Texas.

03:36.684 --> 03:43.835
There have been a bunch of things that we have 
worked on with other people to accomplish within

03:36.684 --> 03:43.835
those organizations. One thing that I think that 
was reasonably remarkable that I was involved in

03:45.036 --> 03:53.128
along with one of the planners from the 
Dallas-Fort Worth area was the writing of the

03:53.682 --> 04:11.719
enabling legislation for regional planning 
commissions, which we did as a part of our CPAT

03:53.682 --> 04:11.719
activities and passed on to the Texas Municipal 
League, who found the support for it and got it

03:53.682 --> 04:11.719
passed. They, however, removed all of the, the 
Texas Municipal League removed from our

04:11.739 --> 04:22.710
recommendations before they passed on all of the 
ability for taxation. that it wouldn't fly that

04:24.226 --> 04:48.107
way oh date that's interesting well I suspect that 
it was probably in the vicinity of 1964 but I don't

04:24.226 --> 04:48.107
remember exactly when I think the regional 
planning legislation was probably passed by the

04:24.226 --> 04:48.107
65 legislature 63 or 65 in the early 60s

04:52.323 --> 04:54.225
I don't know what else. I think that covers the 
essential points of history so that you would

04:54.565 --> 05:06.477
understand how my comments are during the period 
of time that I worked at CRS. Virtually all the

05:06.577 --> 05:22.313
things I did were in other parts of the United 
States so that I had a five-year gap in my

05:06.577 --> 05:22.313
association with Houston things and a good 
comparison towards what was being done in other

05:06.577 --> 05:22.313
parts of the country. And I observed, in general, 
that when you compare things to a city like

05:22.580 --> 05:37.510
Philadelphia, which at that point was touted to be 
the great mecca of planning, I discovered that, in

05:22.580 --> 05:37.510
my opinion, it was not. There were a lot of people 
involved in functions that had planning

05:38.231 --> 05:42.259
somewhere in their title. But what they were 
mainly doing was jealously guarding their own

05:42.830 --> 05:49.121
little bailiwick, and there was very little 
cooperation going on. It took an enormous amount

05:49.622 --> 05:55.872
of time and effort, most of which was 
unproductive, to accomplish anything in

05:49.622 --> 05:55.872
Philadelphia. Was that during the Ed Bacon 
regime? Yes, it was during Ed Bacon's regime.

06:02.924 --> 06:07.572
I think that the majority of the planning things 
that were so highly... touted in Philadelphia

06:08.041 --> 06:20.659
were, in fact, largely physical design elements 
and didn't have a lot to do with some of the hardcore

06:08.041 --> 06:20.659
basics of real planning. There is now a backlash in 
the planning department because of that. And the

06:26.227 --> 06:30.594
pendulum has swung to the other extreme, 
unfortunately. Really? That is too bad. I have

06:31.715 --> 06:36.462
documentation on this because of the book I'm 
working on. And I'd hope to use Philadelphia as an

06:36.678 --> 06:45.491
example of continuation of the comprehensive 
planning process, but I'm afraid I cannot. That's

06:45.511 --> 06:46.492
such a bad. One of the things that I was involved in 
in Philadelphia had to do with Eastwick, which

06:48.274 --> 06:58.449
must be one of the world's greatest planning 
disasters. And as a part, just because I was

06:59.410 --> 07:04.137
curious about it, I delved into some of the 
background information scrunched up some of the

07:04.454 --> 07:09.019
old reports, and I understood why it turned out to 
be such a disaster. Did you meet Bill Grigsby? No.

07:12.082 --> 07:15.405
Who had done the market feasibility study for 
Eastwick? No. He was now the head of the planning

07:16.246 --> 07:22.512
department at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Uh-huh. I may have met him since, but I didn't meet

07:23.413 --> 07:30.019
him

07:23.413 --> 07:30.019
yet. OK, what else do you want to talk about? The 
single biggest event that went on during the time

07:34.492 --> 07:40.417
that I was president of the Texas chapter of AIB. 
And you were elected in what year? I

07:41.698 --> 07:46.703
have to count backwards. We're now in 81. 81. 
Probably 1977,

07:48.204 --> 07:55.431
so the merger was accomplished in 78. And

07:55.631 --> 08:03.638
before that I was the Texas chapter secretary, and 
before that I had been the Houston section

08:04.327 --> 08:05.748
director. So I've really been on the executive 
committee for a very long time.

08:12.475 --> 08:17.440
The single biggest thing that happened while I was 
president was the merger between AIP and ASCO. And

08:18.101 --> 08:24.767
the consideration of that merger and the various 
implications used up a lot of time at the chapter

08:18.101 --> 08:24.767
level as well as the national level. It was very 
difficult to keep ongoing programs and things

08:26.129 --> 08:34.317
that we had decided that we wanted to accomplish as 
a group going on while there was a consideration of

08:36.322 --> 08:43.528
changing the entire nature of the organization. I 
personally was opposed to the merger. And I have

08:48.072 --> 08:59.201
discovered that a large number of people who are 
very active within APA now, even at the national

08:48.072 --> 08:59.201
level, were also opposed to it. Everybody has sort 
of shrugged their shoulders and said, OK, we

08:59.341 --> 09:03.385
decided to do it. And now we're going to do our best 
to make it work. And I think most people are doing

09:07.304 --> 09:09.686
their best to make it work. However, I will observe 
that the net effect of what we did has little effect

09:09.746 --> 09:25.601
at the chapter level other than to increase the 
volume of membership. It has not increased the

09:26.042 --> 09:29.505
number of active members. It has not changed the 
active people. The new active people are still

09:36.548 --> 09:38.030
coming from the same place as they were. There are 
young people entering the profession or people

09:38.050 --> 09:42.295
who have moved here from other parts of the state. 
They are not civilians involved in planning. And

09:48.503 --> 09:58.175
this, I have found, is generally true throughout 
my district because I've talked to the presidents

09:48.503 --> 09:58.175
of the various chapters in my district, so I don't 
think we're atypical. Texas did have a smaller

09:58.695 --> 10:05.644
percentage gain in membership than almost anyone 
else. as the result of the merger. And I think that

10:08.238 --> 10:21.285
pointed to something that we were maybe not aware 
of, that a very high percentage of the people who

10:08.238 --> 10:21.285
were active in planning in Texas were AIP members 
of one category or another. We had an unusually

10:22.347 --> 10:25.894
high. I think that part of that comes from our sheer 
distances apart and our knowledge that we share

10:26.279 --> 10:36.113
the same laws and the same problems. Most of our 
cities are developing in the freeway era, and we do

10:36.233 --> 10:48.551
have the same problems, and we had a great need to 
communicate with each other about our problems

10:36.233 --> 10:48.551
and offer our good solutions to each other. In 
other parts of the country, people tended to be

10:48.571 --> 10:55.982
much more insular in their outlook, that people 
are flabbergasted that we could have a chapter

10:56.924 --> 11:10.764
that, you know, is a thousand miles across and 
however many miles in the other direction it is,

10:56.924 --> 11:10.764
800 or so, and that we could actually work 
together, but we do. At any rate, at the national

11:10.804 --> 11:21.719
level, there continues to be a concern about 
involving the citizens who are interested in

11:10.804 --> 11:21.719
planning. And there continue to be New 
suggestions, and mainly they're fairly feeble.

11:32.515 --> 11:43.974
While people, the result of all the screaming in 
the 60s about people being interested in planning

11:32.515 --> 11:43.974
and how they should be interested in planning did 
generate interest. People do attend public

11:44.034 --> 11:52.648
hearings, although I would suggest that mostly 
it's the negative interests that attend public

11:44.034 --> 11:52.648
hearings. People, citizens, still are not 
sufficiently interested in planning to commit

11:54.181 --> 12:09.277
large blocks of time or money to learning more 
about it, even if they have positions of some

11:54.181 --> 12:09.277
considerable responsibility on local 
commissions. And I think that regardless of what

12:10.779 --> 12:21.690
we do at the national level, we've got to be 
realistic and understand that we are primarily

12:10.779 --> 12:21.690
going to be an organization of professional 
planners. you asked about the net result on the

12:22.683 --> 12:25.666
dues. For the person who was a full AIP member, 
there's been very little effect on the dues.

12:31.513 --> 12:36.398
You're paying about the same thing as you would 
have been paying had AIP continued to exist.

12:39.061 --> 12:48.312
Now I'd have to go back and look at the rate of 
inflation and look at the old, I don't even

12:39.061 --> 12:48.312
remember what associate AIP people were paying. 
But I think the dues are generally about the same.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.898
as they might have been.

13:01.730 --> 13:04.615
Let me ask you a final question.

13:07.521 --> 13:13.513
From your perception and knowledge of Houston, 
what do you think should happen in the near future

13:14.101 --> 13:20.911
in terms of planning in the greater Houston area? 
What kinds of things should occur, structural or

13:21.512 --> 13:25.117
otherwise?

13:28.442 --> 13:43.264
Well, I think the most important thing that we've 
got to recognize and come to grips with ways to

13:28.442 --> 13:43.264
implement is that it is no longer possible for us to 
be a single center town. even though our, quote,

13:43.683 --> 13:58.060
downtown area is very active and healthy and 
continuing to grow, that we have passed into a

13:43.683 --> 13:58.060
category of cities more like Chicago and that we do 
have to have sub-centers. And we need to do some

13:59.462 --> 14:09.994
positive things to allow and promote these 
sub-centers to happen effectively with the kind

13:59.462 --> 14:09.994
of transportation networks, etc., In all of the 
planning that's going on now, we're only talking

14:10.598 --> 14:28.805
about serving sub-centers that already exist and 
that have come into being without the benefit of

14:10.598 --> 14:28.805
any formal assistance from a planning standpoint 
from the governments. The medical center might be

14:29.286 --> 14:31.950
the single exception to that. But we really need to 
be looking at sub-centers that are further out.

14:38.257 --> 14:40.920
Perhaps Katy, perhaps the Woodlands is one. But, 
you know, we are merely continuing on our way with

14:41.641 --> 14:46.306
our normal grid thoroughfare system. Works fine 
if you have a residential neighborhood thing and

14:46.826 --> 14:52.052
it's attendant commercial stuff. Doesn't work 
too well, as we could prove with Galleria, when you

14:52.373 --> 14:59.080
get a real center working, your transportation 
network just collapses. I think there are a number

15:00.521 --> 15:04.686
of, I think I know there are a number of people in 
influential positions who are aware of that.

15:07.930 --> 15:32.985
Vernon, who also neglected to mention this, was 
part of a group of about 30 influential citizens,

15:07.930 --> 15:32.985
including the presidents of all the major oil 
companies, the mayor, the police chief, et

15:07.930 --> 15:32.985
cetera, who spent a weekend retreat down at the 
Tenneco-owned resort community down south and

15:07.930 --> 15:32.985
west of town. And they did discuss the need for 
sub-centers. No one can come to grips with the

15:37.007 --> 15:40.912
problem, however, of whose property it's going to 
be on. And I think that's the crux of the problem.

15:46.220 --> 15:58.037
There have been comments about the role that the 
planning department is taking at this time. Do you

15:58.057 --> 15:59.479
think that should change? Certainly. The 
planning department is sort of following along

16:03.408 --> 16:05.633
licking at the heels of what's happening. And they 
ought to be out there helping the people in the

16:05.653 --> 16:18.542
forefront to do the right thing, to make the 
change, to realize that Houston is transitioning

16:05.653 --> 16:18.542
from one kind of a city into another. And they 
really are not. We need some active leadership

16:21.025 --> 16:24.049
within the department. I think that they usually 
have the bright young minds who could think a lot of

16:25.370 --> 16:36.883
the things if they had the sort of philosophical, 
attitudinal things, directions and assistance.

16:37.404 --> 16:43.691
And I think it isn't just the planning director 
that they need real help from the mayor and the city

16:37.404 --> 16:43.691
council. I would hope that. even though I was 
afraid that the system of changing, the change

16:46.861 --> 16:59.555
system of electing city council members would 
turn out to be to the city's detriment. So far, it

17:00.196 --> 17:11.569
seems that rather than being more of a pork barrel, 
that is much less of a pork barrel, and that the

17:00.196 --> 17:11.569
number of these councilmen who've been elected 
from districts have much more compunction to

17:12.224 --> 17:26.478
speak out about the needs of the city as a whole and 
don't have the long-term vested interests by

17:12.224 --> 17:26.478
certain money groups and sort of warp the older 
councilman's thinking around. I mean we did after

17:27.639 --> 17:38.569
this new council did after all these years finally 
adopt the billboard ordinance that we fought for

17:27.639 --> 17:38.569
gee I think I first joined billboards limited 12 
years ago And we made drafts of ordinances. When

17:43.364 --> 17:59.041
the first year I worked for CRS, I drafted a 
billboard ordinance as a part of one of our civic

17:43.364 --> 17:59.041
endeavor things through Billboards Inc. And it's 
finally been passed. The chap who eased past John

17:59.061 --> 18:04.367
Shanahan in the final runoff. Yes. Who I 
understand is rather good. Yes, he has turned out

18:07.330 --> 18:09.653
to be rather good. He may not have some of the same 
credentials as John, but he certainly has some of

18:10.105 --> 18:17.179
the same interests. And he's been very clever 
about getting some things passed. I think we've

18:22.549 --> 18:26.697
all been very surprised. At any rate, hopefully 
this new group of councilmen could assist. But

18:30.774 --> 18:34.580
somewhere, somebody's got to step up with the 
leadership. And to me, at this point, it looks as if

18:35.702 --> 18:42.632
it may have to come from the private sector.

18:46.037 --> 18:50.844
We may be talking about having to get together a 
group of prominent citizens. Well, I think the

18:51.385 --> 18:55.030
West Houston Association is a good example of 
what's happened as a result of the dearth of

18:55.634 --> 18:58.738
planning. The West Houston Association was 
formed by a small group of progressive developers

18:59.139 --> 19:11.875
whose interests were mainly on the West Side, and 
they saw that there was nothing going on out there.

19:11.895 --> 19:19.225
A lot of it was from their own self-interest, but 
they saw that things were not going on out there

19:11.895 --> 19:19.225
that needed to go on. And they made their own 
association and hired a planner to be director of

19:19.906 --> 19:25.573
it, and they are filling some of the basic 
informational and accomplishment things that

19:26.583 --> 19:33.431
the Houston City Finance Department ought to be 
doing. That should be tax supported. Well, I think

19:37.296 --> 19:41.401
this particular group of developers really don't 
care whether it's tax supported or not. They just

19:41.421 --> 19:42.382
want it done. And they're probably willing to 
support it. But it's a public responsibility,

19:45.747 --> 19:47.469
though. It is a public responsibility. We're 
fortunate that there are a bunch of guys who think

19:49.071 --> 19:55.138
that they have a public responsibility and are 
willing to be involved in it. But they're getting

19:56.743 --> 19:58.285
roads built. They're pushing to get the parks 
approved. It's reminiscent of the early days of

20:02.270 --> 20:23.775
planning in Boston, and San Francisco, and so 
forth, and New York, where the private interests,

20:02.270 --> 20:23.775
philanthropic interests, funded regional plans 
and regional planning programs, such as TELUS in

20:02.270 --> 20:23.775
San Francisco, the Regional Plan Association in 
New York, and Philane and Boston and so forth. It's

20:28.027 --> 20:33.291
a pity that one has to make comments and see these 
sorts of things happening in 1981. Yeah, it is.

20:39.337 --> 20:43.981
Mary Lou, I know you've got a bunch of work hanging 
fire. Let's try one more time, Margaret. Thank you

20:45.543 --> 20:46.284
very much. Good afternoon. We are at the residence 
of Ralph and Mrs. Ellefrit, and we are talking

20:53.776 --> 21:16.303
about the role of Mr. Elefret in the initial days of 
planning in Houston and on up through his

20:53.776 --> 21:16.303
retirement from the planning department and 
subsequent professional activities. Ralph,

21:17.545 --> 21:19.207
would you like to begin?

21:21.570 --> 21:22.551
One of my first activities when the planning 
department was formed in March of

21:22.970 --> 21:49.416
1940

21:22.970 --> 21:49.416
was to obtain some background on what had happened 
in planning in the past.

21:49.565 --> 22:07.685
The city government had just moved from the old 
city hall, which was also the city market, into the

21:49.565 --> 22:07.685
new building, which is now the main city hall with 
the council chambers.

22:13.992 --> 22:19.318
The only materials that I found were down in the 
vault of the old City Hall scattered on the floor

22:20.446 --> 22:48.968
some role plans

22:20.446 --> 22:48.968
miscellaneous traffic counts that listed the 
number of automobiles and the number of horse

22:20.446 --> 22:48.968
drawn vehicles at certain points in the city and 
quite a miscellaneous group of information

22:49.218 --> 23:18.752
gradually by talking to others and

22:49.218 --> 23:18.752
scouting around I did gain a little background and 
apparently the first planning of course was the

22:49.218 --> 23:18.752
original site of the city itself which extended 
north from Texas Avenue to the bio and six blocks on

22:49.218 --> 23:18.752
either side of the of Main Street to the east and 
west,

23:19.576 --> 23:30.667
which was laid out as the original town site in 1836 
by the Allen brothers. And this was truly perhaps

23:31.908 --> 23:48.385
the most remarkable important planning that has 
been done in Houston because it gave the downtown

23:31.908 --> 23:48.385
area a base of regular streets all 80 feet wide 
except Maine which is 90 and

23:49.293 --> 24:17.629
it provided a block for the county courthouse and a 
block for public buildings where the old city hall

23:49.293 --> 24:17.629
was located and

23:49.293 --> 24:17.629
has this pattern which was expanded south

24:18.655 --> 24:47.430
and also to the east and west for a reasonable 
distance now includes all of the of the real

24:18.655 --> 24:47.430
central business district and it has served 
extremely well in with the smaller blocks and the

24:18.655 --> 24:47.430
wide streets to to handle the growing density of 
the city. And this was a real auspicious

24:52.738 --> 24:55.982
beginning. But of course, beyond this general 
pattern, the city grew rather wildly. Most cities

25:04.671 --> 25:10.778
are planted on north-south and east-west 
orientations. And the original Allen Brothers

25:11.619 --> 25:16.905
subdivision seems to be at an angle from that. Is 
there some reason for that? The tradition is that

25:19.304 --> 25:30.862
the angle to get the breeze, I really think that is 
somebody's imagination. I think that really the

25:31.703 --> 25:37.793
alignment of the bow had something to do with it. 
And perhaps even the shape of the

25:38.634 --> 25:47.067
piece of the original track. But

25:47.570 --> 26:14.623
beyond the old general pattern of the downtown 
area, since

25:47.570 --> 26:14.623
the land ownerships were by meets and bounds and 
not according to townships and ranges in any

25:47.570 --> 26:14.623
regular pattern,

26:15.869 --> 26:28.284
there were many developments

26:15.869 --> 26:28.284
at various angles where the streets made bad 
connections and so forth. Now the next jump in

26:28.304 --> 26:42.400
planning came during the latter part of what was 
the City Beautiful era before the before World War

26:43.139 --> 26:44.902
I.

26:52.753 --> 27:05.833
In around 1910 to 1913 it appeared that many cities 
were driven by an impetus of civic design and civic

26:52.753 --> 27:05.833
development. It was the end of the city beautiful 
era which was just apparently hitting in Texas

27:13.750 --> 27:21.601
both Dallas and Houston became interested in 
planning.

27:29.492 --> 27:42.930
In 1912

27:29.492 --> 27:42.930
the city government of Houston employed Arthur 
Comey who was then a young professor from Harvard

27:44.513 --> 27:48.877
to come to Houston and prepare a plan and study. And 
he did this and the report was published in 1913.

27:58.685 --> 28:14.098
It was a remarkable study in many respects even 
though following this report we find practically

27:58.685 --> 28:14.098
no evidence of planning or interest in planning 
until 1922

28:17.285 --> 28:34.605
His proposals for large parks included a site 
almost identical to Memorial Park

28:17.285 --> 28:34.605
in the exact location of what became Herman Park. 
And he had several alternate locations for a civic

28:34.625 --> 28:46.819
center, one of which is where the present civic 
center is located.

28:47.879 --> 29:17.751
And even though the many

28:47.879 --> 29:17.751
years elapsed and the plan was in a sense 
forgotten, I'm sure that he implanted ideas and

28:47.879 --> 29:17.751
thoughts in people's minds that carried over into 
the many improvements and important

28:47.879 --> 29:17.751
developments that were later realized.

29:23.495 --> 29:37.610
One of the interesting things about the Comey 
Report was the accuracy of his population

29:23.495 --> 29:37.610
projections from a city of 80,000 to a city of over 
500,000. He took these cities, older and larger

29:37.710 --> 29:48.261
cities of the United States, that had access to 
deep water and

29:50.519 --> 30:05.642
put their population on a graph at the point that 
Houston was at that time, about 80,000. Then he

30:05.702 --> 30:17.640
projected up a mean line through the growth of 
those cities which had already occurred

30:19.814 --> 30:24.158
to propose a future growth of Houston. His 1950 
population came out very close to the population

30:25.599 --> 30:38.291
that

30:25.599 --> 30:38.291
was found in the 1950 census.

30:45.758 --> 30:49.281
I had the pleasure of meeting Arthur Comey at a 
planning conference in Detroit in the early 50s.

30:59.280 --> 31:16.877
He was then an elderly man, was no longer teaching, 
but fortunately he said that he had a number of

30:59.280 --> 31:16.877
copies of the report, none of which were available 
in Houston at the time. And so he sent us some copies

31:20.311 --> 31:27.958
of the report and these are now available in the 
planning department.
