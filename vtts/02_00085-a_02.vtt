WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:04.282
And so we did that. We spent about $500 on 
high-grade lumber and set up the first loft in

00:04.382 --> 00:19.362
Moore Hall, and consequently became tour guides 
to a lot of people from around campus who wanted to

00:04.382 --> 00:19.362
see our construction. So we kind of customized it. 
Right. And what else? Television? Had a

00:25.389 --> 00:26.331
television, yes. Had a television, had a stereo. 
You had to have a stereo. I would have to say that in

00:29.815 --> 00:39.310
1976 a stereo was much more highly regarded than a 
television. It seemed like you could go somewhere

00:41.253 --> 00:47.723
and watch TV, but you couldn't go just anywhere and 
listen to the music you wanted to listen to. And did

00:47.703 --> 00:52.334
you have any place to cook and refrigerate? 
Cooking was not allowed. We did have a

00:53.638 --> 00:55.262
refrigerator. In fact, everybody had a 
refrigerator. We rented those for $50 a semester.

01:00.114 --> 01:03.923
We in fact had two at one time, which I think was a 
violation of dorm policy. but nonetheless we did

01:03.903 --> 01:23.447
have two because we needed a place to store all the 
fajitas I was bringing back from Laredo and

01:03.903 --> 01:23.447
tortillas and things like that that I 
subsequently was giving away and then my father

01:03.903 --> 01:23.447
said you know you may want to curtail that a little 
bit because $50 every time you come home for

01:23.427 --> 01:27.117
fajitas is getting out of hand. But interestingly 
enough, I had people offer me two and $2.50 a pound

01:28.421 --> 01:34.417
for these fajitas that they couldn't buy in 
College Station. And they'd also offer me a little

01:35.239 --> 01:38.027
more if I'd cook them for them. Yeah, we had two 
refrigerators and a little warming plate, which I

01:38.564 --> 01:44.071
think again was illegal. The main thing you saw in 
dorms were popcorn poppers and refrigerators,

01:45.113 --> 01:52.343
and that was about it. Were there telephones in 
every room then? There were telephones in every

01:54.265 --> 01:57.229
room, sure were, and they were all rotary dial. 
There wasn't anything as a push button at that

01:58.050 --> 02:01.635
time. Before I left A&M, the push button was 
introduced. In the average room in those days,

02:05.822 --> 02:12.294
what kind of beverages were refrigerated in the 
rooms? Festive beverages, I would categorize

02:13.576 --> 02:17.242
them as. That is another little anecdote of my 
Laredo upbringing.

02:26.759 --> 02:45.325
After the fall of 76 trip to Laredo where about 
eight of my buddies in the dorm accompanied me on a

02:26.759 --> 02:45.325
deer hunt, we went to the Cadillac bar and you've 
got to understand how popular an 18-year-old, and

02:26.759 --> 02:45.325
the legal drinking age at that time was 18, but how 
popular an 18-year-old can be when your father is

02:45.305 --> 02:53.077
the owner of the Cadillac bar in Nuevo Laredo, 
Mexico. We had to limit the trip to eight, and deer

02:54.779 --> 02:57.884
hunting was not the draw. But after that trip, 
well, during that trip, I introduced those seven

03:00.087 --> 03:13.928
other buddies of mine to some Mexican beer, 
Bohemia, Carta Blanca, Corona. And they found out

03:13.908 --> 03:18.114
that we could buy a case of that for as little as 
$3.70. And I think we brought back 16 cases of beer.

03:24.122 --> 03:30.691
So yes, at that time, we did have some beer in our 
refrigerators. As far as you know, in those years,

03:31.112 --> 03:37.701
how often did a student get drunk in the dormitory? 
Haskell, I never got drunk in the dormitory, but I

03:38.522 --> 03:43.729
did see one person who was, as I would categorize 
it, really out of control drunk in my history at

03:45.127 --> 03:52.452
A&M, and that was it. I never saw just a whole lot of 
drunken Aggies in our dorm. And in that era, did

04:00.416 --> 04:08.888
Aggies normally drink beer or did they drink 
whiskey and other? Beer. Beer. Beer. While we're

04:12.072 --> 04:17.840
on that topic, what were the most popular student 
hangouts for beer in those days? The Dixie Chicken

04:18.081 --> 04:20.584
was only two years old. when I got to A&M, and it 
didn't enjoy the notoriety that it does today, but

04:20.564 --> 04:33.630
the proximity was such that you could walk to the 
chicken from Moore Hall in the span of about four

04:20.564 --> 04:33.630
minutes. So it was the premier spot for us. There 
was a place called the Sports Club that went out of

04:37.798 --> 04:42.808
business while I was at A&M. that was quite 
popular, particularly with athletes. It was more

04:46.008 --> 04:48.031
of a discotheque at that time. The Hall of Fame was a 
Thursday or Friday night regular, and that was

04:49.294 --> 04:57.770
because you had the opportunity to dance there 
that you didn't have at the Dixie Chicken. What

04:58.190 --> 04:59.032
about Sparky's? Was it good? was really unknown to 
me during my years at A&M. And the only time I really

05:06.749 --> 05:14.087
knew much about it was when some friends of mine who 
were in the corps told me to meet them at Sparky's.

05:14.788 --> 05:18.938
And I did, but it was predominantly a corps 
hangout. When you and your buddies went off

05:18.918 --> 05:30.807
campus, did you ever encounter any difficulties 
of civilian and corps members off campus? None

05:30.948 --> 05:31.629
whatsoever. Never saw it. In all my experiences, 
whether it was the a student experience like

05:36.333 --> 05:44.324
bonfire or an academic experience like studying 
together or just student leadership. I never saw

05:45.426 --> 05:48.911
that animosity or anything like that. What about 
the, using the politically correct word,

05:48.931 --> 05:53.597
diversity? How diverse was the student body and 
how were minority student body individuals

05:54.518 --> 06:02.870
treated? I would have to categorize this as more of 
an international student versus minorities,

06:05.510 --> 06:14.153
domestic minorities, if you will.

06:17.288 --> 06:46.165
I have one recollection of a very sad experience 
that I witnessed in the registration process over

06:17.288 --> 06:46.165
at Heaton Hall, where an international student 
was having difficulty registering, and the

06:17.288 --> 06:46.165
young, not the young, but the woman behind the 
desk, instead of maybe just listening a little

06:17.288 --> 06:46.165
more attentively, spoke louder as if he didn't 
understand, and his hearing was perfectly fine,

06:46.145 --> 06:53.944
and ultimately just

06:46.145 --> 06:53.944
kind of treated him in a very degrading way and 
shuffled him off and I took that opportunity to

06:55.207 --> 07:01.233
visit with that person. It was very 
disappointing. He was from Panama and since I

07:04.696 --> 07:15.526
spoke Spanish it was an easy conversation for me to 
have and helped him out and to this day I still keep

07:04.696 --> 07:15.526
in touch with him. But as far as minorities go, my 
background was such that I was a minority. And all

07:24.316 --> 07:29.065
of a sudden, when I came to A&M, I had never seen as 
many blonde-haired, blue-eyed girls in my whole

07:24.316 --> 07:29.065
life. And that's why I quickly fell out of love in 
1975. I would have to categorize A&M as a very

07:32.793 --> 07:39.345
inclusive atmosphere. I just didn't see any real 
challenge to a multicultural problem. I think

07:47.097 --> 07:48.138
that's true. I've always said the key thing, are 
you an Aggie? Come on, if you're an Aggie, let's go.

07:57.290 --> 07:57.851
That's right. If you're not and don't like it, well 
fine, hit the road. No, I enjoyed, I was invited to

08:00.874 --> 08:10.827
play in what was then known as the Pan American 
Games, which I guess historically had been four

08:10.807 --> 08:23.086
Central American countries, and it was nothing 
more than a softball tournament, a swimming

08:10.807 --> 08:23.086
volleyball weekend, golf, basketball I think was 
introduced at one point, soccer. But one of the

08:24.328 --> 08:36.426
real highlights of my time at A&M was every spring 
playing in the Pan American games and being

08:24.328 --> 08:36.426
invited to do so just because I was from Laredo, 
spoke Spanish, and appreciated their culture.

08:39.351 --> 08:42.777
And that meant something to me. Okay, please, I'm 
reading my notes now, please recall some of the

08:43.759 --> 08:54.998
jokes, pranks, or other good bull that you may have 
known about during your years at A&M, whether you

08:43.759 --> 08:54.998
were involved or not. Okay.

08:59.474 --> 09:01.038
Well, I'll just be very honest with you. By 
default, once again, in living in that corner

09:01.078 --> 09:14.496
room, by happenstance, also found out that the key 
to my room was known as a passkey. This was brought

09:14.476 --> 09:26.038
to my attention by a fellow who I had lent my key to to 
get into my dorm and found out that it opened his

09:14.476 --> 09:26.038
room just by default once again. And so we tried it 
on a few other doors and found out it opened every

09:26.078 --> 09:35.657
room in the dorm, including the dorm, the basement 
door. where we found a cache of fireworks in the

09:35.637 --> 09:43.690
fall of 1976. And this made me quite popular with 
some of my buddies when we needed access to those

09:44.832 --> 09:55.249
fireworks or other items that had been 
sequestered down there. But in the spring of 1977,

09:57.102 --> 10:14.638
this all came to a crashing end when a fellow named 
Willie Gaines, class of 1979, who is now a very

09:57.102 --> 10:14.638
prominent doctor here in College Station, was the 
fourth floor RA, and early in the morning,

10:17.335 --> 10:40.204
He came walking down the first floor hall and heard 
something and took his own passkey, opened up that

10:17.335 --> 10:40.204
basement door, went down the little steps, and 
found me and two of my buddies neatly wrapping up in

10:17.335 --> 10:40.204
a pillowcase fireworks and some other things that 
had been confiscated. And he was very polite but

10:40.244 --> 10:45.250
very firm and said, How did y'all get down here? And 
I finally had to fess up. Well, that was the end of my

10:48.775 --> 10:50.377
passkey days. But the results of some of that over a 
six, seven month period were bottle rockets

10:51.638 --> 11:09.381
across the quad, fireworks at two in the morning, 
fireworks under doors, fireworks in the air

10:51.638 --> 11:09.381
conditioning and heating vents. And I was a part of 
that, I must admit. One of the real ugly things I

11:15.288 --> 11:32.128
think that took place, turned out to be ugly 
anyway, was we had a head resident on our floor that

11:15.288 --> 11:32.128
just wasn't in tune with the rest of the dorm.

11:34.336 --> 11:47.009
I was literally talked into this prank, and we were 
out in the country, and we found a goat, and we

11:34.336 --> 11:47.009
thought it would be a neat thing if we turned that 
goat loose in this fellow's dorm room while he was

11:34.336 --> 11:47.009
gone for the weekend. Our thoughts were that the 
goat would just maybe defecate in some strategic

11:47.809 --> 11:56.058
locations, and that would be it. We didn't realize 
that that goat would not only defecate and urinate

11:57.579 --> 12:03.465
but proceed to eat everything it could find within 
its reach, whether it was wood, metal, paper,

12:04.846 --> 12:15.215
toothpaste, cologne, you name it. And so the 
byproduct of that, pardon the pun, was some of his

12:15.815 --> 12:30.368
refuse was quite aromatic and quite inconsistent 
with that of a normal goat out in the pasture. And it

12:31.089 --> 12:33.891
just added to the... It was just hard to believe. We 
thought our head resident was gone on Friday,

12:37.015 --> 12:40.158
coming home on Saturday. He had actually left 
Friday afternoon and wasn't coming home till

12:40.759 --> 12:46.005
early, early Sunday morning. So while we thought 
he would find the goat midday Saturday, he didn't

12:47.767 --> 12:53.313
find the goat until mid-morning Sunday. And it is 
quite amazing, Haskell, what a mature goat can do

12:54.194 --> 13:02.764
in the span of about 60 hours to an eight by 10 dorm 
room. Did any students get punished for that? Yes,

13:05.972 --> 13:06.614
I did. I did. In fact, I was brought before the, I 
think his name was Rick Crow. I think he's still

13:14.593 --> 13:15.415
here. And I had to go see him and justify why I had 
done that. And there were some weekends that I had

13:18.944 --> 13:26.505
to sit and do some service around the dorm, which I 
did, and my buddies had to do as well. And I paid the

13:27.668 --> 13:29.092
price. What about, were there drown-outs in 
civilian dorms? Oh, yes. Oh, gosh, yes. crap outs,

13:33.946 --> 13:38.052
whatever you want to call them.

13:39.233 --> 13:56.477
I won't give you the definitive term, but what you 
basically did was take whatever trash can was in

13:39.233 --> 13:56.477
the hall, usually a 40 gallon, 35 gallon plastic, 
big tub trash can, and regardless of what was in it,

13:56.457 --> 14:08.411
And sometimes it wasn't what you might expect, but 
fill it up with water and appropriately lean it on

13:56.457 --> 14:08.411
somebody's door and then knock vigorously and run 
like hell. And that was quite popular. Did you ever

14:11.493 --> 14:13.777
get drowned out? I never got drowned out, believe 
it or not. I did not. I had some shaving cream come

14:17.724 --> 14:23.134
flying into my room out of an album cover one 
evening. I had a flaming bag of refuse left on my

14:23.154 --> 14:33.332
door one time, but other than that, no, I didn't 
have the drown out. And nobody played any games

14:33.312 --> 14:35.655
with anybody's cars? Never. Never? Okay.

14:40.401 --> 14:43.505
What about when somebody was down the hall 
showering? Any things in the showers? Yeah. I

14:49.692 --> 14:59.725
don't have real vivid recollections of that, but 
the one that I do have, I don't know that it's

14:49.692 --> 14:59.725
appropriate to put on record, but it had to do with a 
fellow who had had too many festive beverages one

15:01.493 --> 15:03.938
night. And his roommate, of all people, led this 
charge because he was tired of his roommate, I

15:03.978 --> 15:16.362
think, coming in drunk at 3 and 4 in the morning. And 
this young man who was hungover on a Sunday morning

15:20.731 --> 15:31.302
was sitting in an open stall, which we had probably 
seven in this community bath set up in Moore Hall,

15:20.731 --> 15:31.302
and they were going to drown him out. But before 
they could drown him out, he caught wind of what was

15:31.322 --> 15:49.962
going to happen, and this is a true story, as ugly as 
it is, and believe it or not, reached into the

15:31.322 --> 15:49.962
toilet bowl and grabbed turd and flung it and hit 
his roommate in the head with this thing and his

15:49.942 --> 16:05.106
roommate slips on the way out trying to get away 
from this deal and cuts himself right across the

15:49.942 --> 16:05.106
eye. So he's running down the hall on a Sunday 
morning and I'm coming this way and here he is with

16:14.849 --> 16:19.033
with feces on his forehead and blood all over his 
eyes. And I can't tell you what thoughts went

16:19.054 --> 16:24.319
through my mind thinking, what has this guy done? 
What about

16:24.379 --> 16:28.524
in the dining hall? Were there games played, 
tricks played during that time? Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

16:35.071 --> 16:39.996
Yeah, it was very popular to confuse things such as 
I'm trying to think, but you'd often want to mix

16:39.976 --> 16:54.610
salt instead of sugar with somebody's iced tea.

16:54.978 --> 16:56.039
and things like that. Were you and your buddies, 
did anybody ever go down into the steam tunnels?

17:02.067 --> 17:02.848
Oh, yes. Yeah, I did that. That was very popular. 
Describe, as far as you know, the extent of the

17:05.872 --> 17:09.497
steam tunnels. They were rather accommodating in 
1976. I was led by a group who actually didn't live

17:14.563 --> 17:21.272
in Moore Hall but lived in in Crocker Hall and lived 
in Davis Gary Hall. And I think the goal was that we

17:27.223 --> 17:37.000
wanted a retreat

17:27.223 --> 17:37.000
from an attack that they had planned on the south 
side dormitories when we were going to have a water

17:36.980 --> 17:45.877
fight, which we did with Aston and Dunn Halls. And 
rather than running back through campus, it was

17:47.981 --> 17:56.136
thought that we would just disappear on the south 
side and reappear on the north side. And believe it

17:57.179 --> 18:08.557
or not, those steam tunnels accommodated even the 
tallest member of our party, which was Willie

17:57.179 --> 18:08.557
Gaines, of all people, and he's about 6'5". Steam 
tunnels were quite extensive

18:09.338 --> 18:16.048
around the campus. Were you aware when you were an 
undergraduate of the existence of any secret

18:17.311 --> 18:22.359
fraternities? No, sir. None. Was not made aware of 
any until I took this job in 1981 and had some people

18:24.963 --> 18:34.177
refer to the Sticks, and I can't remember. True 
Texans. That was the first I'd heard of it, and that

18:35.700 --> 18:37.362
was 1982.

18:40.507 --> 18:40.888
Let's see. Back to class. What were the What were 
the normal guidelines to class attendance and

18:44.868 --> 18:52.691
behavior that you understood? I don't mean that 
somebody wrote them down, huh? Well, it was just

18:56.765 --> 18:59.069
different for different classes, Haskell. There 
were some classes where the professor or the

18:59.089 --> 19:10.185
teaching assistant or the graduate assistant, as 
it were, demanded and just penalized you for not

18:59.089 --> 19:10.185
attending class. There were others where, like in 
Judge Stewart's class, you knew intuitively if

19:11.107 --> 19:21.743
you didn't attend that there was going to be a 
problem because you could read that whole book and

19:21.723 --> 19:23.506
not pass the test. And so it was just different for 
different professors. There was a lot of class

19:28.356 --> 19:32.303
cutting though in those days, and I'm sure there 
still is. But it surprised me that people could

19:34.067 --> 19:41.942
blow off, and that was the terminology then, could 
blow off a class as readily as they could. And

19:41.922 --> 19:43.385
survive. All right. What about in class? What 
about any pranks or tricks in class? Oh, I'm sure

19:54.069 --> 19:55.091
there were some. You know, I'd have to think about 
it. There's none that just come to mind. right

19:58.038 --> 19:59.780
away. I did see a professor, a full professor, 
throw an eraser at a member of the Corps who had

19:59.800 --> 20:16.180
fallen asleep in his class, and I thought that was 
funny, but it turned out to be a bad situation for

19:59.800 --> 20:16.180
the professor. The MSC, what role did it play in 
campus life? At that time, it was the hub of most of

20:20.906 --> 20:26.172
the campus activity between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. It 
really was where you gathered either to drink

20:31.700 --> 20:35.504
coffee, study, visit. It was the bookstore, so to 
speak, for anybody that lived on campus, whether

20:37.226 --> 20:46.237
that was just the purchase of a t-shirt or, in fact, 
a textbook or a... I'm trying to think what they

20:47.398 --> 20:48.980
called them now. You may remember being a 
professor yourself. Was it a Scantron sheet? I

20:54.191 --> 20:54.612
think so. Yeah, that's where you had to go to get 
that. So it wasn't the extensive building that it

21:01.522 --> 21:11.651
is now, but it was a very comfortable place to go and 
drink coffee or drink a Coke or meet somebody or

21:01.522 --> 21:11.651
study. Did you get acquainted with the director of 
the MSC during your shooting years? No, sir, did

21:16.455 --> 21:17.476
not. I knew who he was. It was Wayne Stark. I had some 
friends in the College of Business that were quite

21:20.899 --> 21:26.924
enamored with his networking. Now, the YMCA 
wasn't much. No, sir, not really. In fact, that was

21:32.870 --> 21:37.998
where the vice president for student activities 
was located, Dr. John Coldis. And I didn't have to

21:38.399 --> 21:43.928
see him, but that is where I went to see Rick Crowe, 
who I mentioned a minute ago. Guyon Hall was

21:45.491 --> 21:49.737
leveled at about that time. Prior to my getting to 
A&M, Guyon Hall was leveled, yes. This will not be

21:53.243 --> 22:04.880
part of the finished product, but one of the real 
goofs that A&M made was that the guy and family was

21:53.243 --> 22:04.880
not notified in advance. And the first they knew 
about it was a picture they saw in the Waco paper of

22:05.862 --> 22:10.729
the rubble. And a couple years later they gave 
Baylor a very impressive gift, I think three or

22:12.295 --> 22:18.865
four million dollars. And think how handsome 
those columns at the south end of Military Walk

22:18.906 --> 22:34.270
would have been if in future planning those 
columns had been left to be a part of the Rudder

22:18.906 --> 22:34.270
Center you know, a kind of a part of the tradition. 
I've heard great stories about Guy and Hall, and I

22:38.732 --> 22:45.100
wished it would have been around when I got here. 
Let's see.

22:49.364 --> 22:50.726
Let's go back to it. As far as you recall, what did a 
semester or a year cost, and where did that money

22:51.166 --> 22:58.114
come from? I was indeed blessed that my father 
provided 100% of my college expenses. I didn't

23:06.474 --> 23:14.671
work while I was at A&M, and that was a real 
fortunate situation. Looking back on it, I think I

23:15.452 --> 23:17.436
wished I would have worked. There's two big 
regrets I probably have at A&M. One,

23:23.573 --> 23:27.160
interestingly, is that I was not in the Corps. I 
think I would have been an excellent cadet. I

23:31.830 --> 23:35.037
witnessed subsequently a lot of the camaraderie 
that members of the Corps have enjoyed over their

23:36.417 --> 23:38.779
lives. But my second biggest regret is that I 
didn't work when I was a student and that didn't

23:39.720 --> 23:56.158
provide me an opportunity to get to know more of the 
inner workings of A&M and discipline myself to a

23:39.720 --> 23:56.158
more regimented study schedule. But I'd say that 
the typical semester at A&M was about $1,500 to

23:57.659 --> 24:04.346
$2,000.

24:04.987 --> 24:06.188
It was a rather inexpensive

24:09.070 --> 24:11.758
I'm trying to make sure I've got books in that. 
Tuition was, I want to say, $4 a semester hour. I

24:16.190 --> 24:17.634
think that's right. I want to say room and board was 
$643. Rather inexpensive. used books, three to

24:24.393 --> 24:34.135
four hundred dollars at the most, including 
varying materials that went with that, such as lab

24:24.393 --> 24:34.135
materials and so on. But overall, I know I got by for 
less than two thousand dollars a semester.

24:41.210 --> 24:44.157
Describe the student body in terms of what were 
their basic attitudes about life, and what family

24:44.137 --> 24:57.558
background, income, and small town or big city or 
what? Describe that. I'd say small towns more than

24:58.440 --> 25:00.924
big cities. Knew a lot of kids from Houston just by 
percentages, but met a lot of kids from places like

25:08.015 --> 25:18.711
San Angelo, Tyler, Beaumont, Lake Jackson,

25:08.015 --> 25:18.711
Pearsall. I'd have to say that most of the kids at 
least that I chose to run around with were very

25:20.975 --> 25:34.495
conservative in their backgrounds and were 
raised

25:36.145 --> 25:38.368
with somewhat of an agricultural background. And 
it was interesting that here I was in the College of

25:38.729 --> 25:43.054
Business, but running around with a lot of ag 
majors. And I think it was because of my rural

25:43.916 --> 25:50.605
interest and background, but didn't see a lot of 
idealism. At least I didn't witness it. Now, maybe

25:52.567 --> 26:00.398
it's because we didn't have much of a College of 
Liberal Arts, but mostly a strong presence of

26:00.378 --> 26:07.127
disciplined and regimented engineers and ag 
majors and good old boys type. Didn't see many you

26:08.729 --> 26:19.342
know earrings or tattoos or long hair or any 
radical dress really. And in terms of

26:27.665 --> 26:32.171
Religious faith, were you aware of any Jewish 
kids? One. One is all I knew. Did it matter? No. He

26:37.899 --> 26:44.428
was the only real Jewish student that I knew well. 
I'm sure I know there were others. Were there any

26:47.172 --> 26:52.980
religious activities on campus in those days that 
you remember? No. I can remember the Baptist

26:53.732 --> 27:01.405
Student Union being very aggressive in their 
recruitment of our dorm. I was a Catholic. I was

27:03.168 --> 27:04.751
involved in St. Mary's Church. I say I was 
involved. I attended. I don't know that I was

27:09.179 --> 27:10.241
involved. I played on a softball team. Describe, 
as far as you recall, the St. Mary's activities

27:12.444 --> 27:17.533
relating to the campus then. St. Mary's was 
aggressive as well in making themselves known as

27:17.817 --> 27:33.261
the Catholic Church for students, both in their 
proximity and in their attitude and, quite

27:17.817 --> 27:33.261
frankly, their scheduling. on behalf of 
students. Their first Sunday service, I think,

27:35.487 --> 27:46.375
was 845, and I assume the rationale for that was 
that students didn't roll out of bed too early on

27:35.487 --> 27:46.375
Sundays. But they also had a Oh, I forget what they 
called it. It was a mass where kids played guitars

27:51.887 --> 28:00.242
and drums and involved music. Was there a priest 
assigned to the campus? No, not to my

28:03.448 --> 28:05.412
recollection. Not to my recollection. Were there 
any weeknight activities at St. Mary's? Yes there

28:11.783 --> 28:13.807
were, several, several. And I attended some and 
I'd have to say that between the Baptist church and

28:13.827 --> 28:28.594
the Catholic church, those were the two dominant 
religious cultures that I saw. the major optional

28:28.574 --> 28:43.516
student activity organizations, band and so 
forth, what were the, in terms of prestige, what

28:28.574 --> 28:43.516
were the big prestigious student organizations? 
Believe it or not, I think RHA, because of in it it

28:49.364 --> 29:07.542
was parents weekend and they always put on casino 
night and that was quite a prestigious committee

28:49.364 --> 29:07.542
to serve on interestingly enough i didn't see or 
know of a lot of kids who were serving on the muster

28:49.364 --> 29:07.542
committee the campus muster committee where now 
that probably is the most prestigious committee

29:07.522 --> 29:11.167
there is. Student government, obviously, 
student senate and so on, very prestigious and

29:12.789 --> 29:17.916
very sought after. But RHA involved so much fun 
that there was quite a desire to be involved with

29:19.058 --> 29:27.789
the Residence Hall Association. And who were some 
of the key student leaders during your

29:27.809 --> 29:32.095
undergraduate years? Oh, Johnny Lane. Bobby 
Tucker, who's now back here on campus.

29:38.981 --> 29:42.186
Randy Mays, who I had a crush on when I was in school.

29:47.013 --> 29:49.096
Jeff Hancock was our head Yale leader. Joe Wright. 
Tim McManus.

29:57.893 --> 29:59.956
And the president of the student body was a? Bobby 
Tucker. Bobby Tucker. What about some of the other

30:02.580 --> 30:03.722
years? Bob Harvey, who I've come to get to know here 
just recently in his service on the Texas A&M

30:04.623 --> 30:11.714
Foundation trustees. Bob was a well-respected 
member of the Corps of Cadets and was a fine student

30:13.838 --> 30:23.192
body president, and I thought was a guy that I 
always looked up to. Fred McClure had just

30:23.172 --> 30:27.877
finished his role as student body president when I 
got here. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that it would

30:29.579 --> 30:30.821
have been. Okay, because I was waiting for it. So he 
had just finished. He had just finished, yeah.

30:38.149 --> 30:42.293
What did you and your civilian buddies think about 
the Aggie band and the singing cadets? Took great

30:42.334 --> 30:44.035
pride in it. Took great pride in the band and the 
singing cadets as well. My second roommate at A&M

30:47.219 --> 30:55.407
was a member of the scene cadets, and I had great 
insight into what they represented on behalf of

30:47.219 --> 30:55.407
A&M. So, yeah, I had a tremendous appreciation and 
respect for the scene cadets. Great ambassadors

31:01.152 --> 31:02.654
for Texas A&M. I saw a new, to me, a new bumper 
sticker the other day. A young lady driving a car

31:06.678 --> 31:11.282
with a bumper sticker saying, I love my BQ. Yeah, 
I've seen that before. I hadn't seen that one. Do

31:15.907 --> 31:23.436
you remember some important celebrity person?
