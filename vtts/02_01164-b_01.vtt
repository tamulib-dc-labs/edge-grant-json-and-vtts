WEBVTT

00:04.267 --> 00:06.149
Okay, this is Ron Shorn. Okay, this is Ron Shorn 
interviewing Heiss Spinrad at Heiss Home in

00:06.169 --> 00:12.515
Moraga, California on June 9th, 1993. Heida, just 
for the record, what's your full name? Heiren

00:17.580 --> 00:18.521
Spinrad. How do you spell that? 
H-Y-R-O-N-S-P-I-N-R-A-D.

00:25.589 --> 00:26.249
When were you born? Long ago. What date? February 
17th, 1934. And where were you born? New York. What

00:34.287 --> 00:35.048
part of New York? Bad part. Brooklyn? Actually, I 
think I was born in New York City, but I lived in

00:37.852 --> 00:41.457
Brooklyn after the first week. How did you get 
interested in astronomy? My grandmother was

00:45.503 --> 00:53.054
interested in a lot of intellectual things, 
family not having an extraordinarily

00:45.503 --> 00:53.054
intellectual background. I'm not sure where that 
started. But in any case, she brought several

00:55.037 --> 01:03.349
books home when I was, gosh, I don't know, between 
five and seven years of age. and I was interested in

01:04.156 --> 01:06.438
looking at the sky. When I was eight years old, 
during World War II, New York became blacked out,

01:07.039 --> 01:15.986
and therefore the sky got dark. So you could 
actually see the stars in the Milky Way, and

01:16.907 --> 01:20.871
everything that was supposed to be there was 
there. That was fairly inspiring to a young kid. So

01:25.415 --> 01:33.842
I think it was my grandmother's influence and the 
fact that I could see the sky and wonder about it

01:25.415 --> 01:33.842
that got me started, and then I got a small 
telescope of relatively low quality that was

01:34.852 --> 01:47.389
adequate to see a few double stars and perhaps 
maybe barely the phases of Venus. And that helped a

01:47.970 --> 01:48.971
lot, too. That was from some kind of pawn shop, I 
think. Did this interest in astronomy carry

01:55.420 --> 01:57.924
through high school? No, not vividly. In high 
school, I sort of got away from that. I was more

02:02.971 --> 02:04.032
interested in in sports, and I still did okay in 
physics and chemistry and mathematics, but I

02:04.535 --> 02:12.785
didn't really have my heart in it. On the other 
hand, I didn't know what else to do when I went to

02:13.246 --> 02:21.236
start my undergraduate education at Berkeley, so 
I decided I would be an astronomer unless

02:13.246 --> 02:21.236
something better came along. How come Berkeley if 
you were born in New York City? Yes, good point. My

02:26.462 --> 02:32.770
family and I moved to California in 1946 when I was 
12 years old, in junior high school. So I did my

02:35.061 --> 02:40.066
junior high school and high school curriculum in 
San Francisco. Berkeley was nearby, in those days

02:40.506 --> 02:53.578
very inexpensive, and I could live there and not 
break the bank, which was relatively thin. So were

02:55.040 --> 02:56.241
you an astronomy major? Yeah, I was an astronomy 
major initially by default. Then after I took a

02:59.544 --> 03:02.166
class with Struve, I knew I really liked it. I don't 
know if he had a reputation of being a good teacher,

03:05.244 --> 03:10.452
but he was inspirational, whether he knew it or 
not. When did you get your bachelor's degree?

03:12.936 --> 03:15.280
Bachelor's degree was in 55. And then you went to 
grad school? No, I was in the Army for two years in

03:18.184 --> 03:30.263
between, in the Philippines, Marianas, 
Carolinas, and Western US, measuring stellar

03:18.184 --> 03:30.263
occultations under John O'Keefe's project, 
which was to find the location of everything

03:30.817 --> 03:35.202
between the West Coast and China for unpeaceful 
reasons. Middle of the Cold War, of course. Yeah.

03:38.867 --> 03:42.451
What did you... What was your thesis on? My thesis 
was the stellar content of nearby bright

03:42.771 --> 03:46.215
galaxies. I did that with Whitford and Mayall, 
predominantly. Did you pick that, or did they pick

03:49.699 --> 03:51.902
it for you? I picked it, actually, which was 
perhaps slightly unusual, and that made it a

03:51.922 --> 04:00.452
little bit hard to find the appropriate advisor, 
but it turned out that those two men... Male and

04:00.635 --> 04:05.060
Woodford actually were perfect for this, and I 
learned a lot from them. Why did you pick that

04:05.080 --> 04:06.222
topic? Why were you interested in it? I've always 
been interested in stellar spectra and the

04:08.545 --> 04:21.260
stellar content of galaxies I thought could be 
attacked in that way, and Morgan and Male had just

04:08.545 --> 04:21.260
come out with a paper doing a little bit of that in a 
very qualitative way. So it was somewhat of an

04:22.081 --> 04:29.730
outgrowth of the interest in stars and the 
timeliness of it and the availability of...

04:30.065 --> 04:34.190
relatively modest, or now we would say very 
modest, equipment on medium-sized telescopes.

04:34.210 --> 04:36.734
Which was like the Crossley, 36 inches. 0.9 
meters, yeah, 36 inches. I used both 36 inches at

04:38.556 --> 04:42.301
Lick, actually, the Crossley more than the 
refractor. When did you get your Ph.D.? Ph.D. was

04:44.384 --> 04:45.726
in 61. Okay, and where did you go from there? Right 
to JPL. How come? Well, that was strange. Yeah,

04:51.814 --> 04:52.595
yeah, I know. Sagan had come to Berkeley in 60, I 
guess, as a Miller... fellow after his PhD from

04:58.550 --> 05:02.459
Chicago. And he was the first person around 
Berkeley to talk about planets in what then seemed

05:02.479 --> 05:17.132
a modern way, exploring them by spacecraft, 
exploring them in other ways, and doing more than

05:02.479 --> 05:17.132
just a few poorish review articles of the previous 
generation would suggest. Certainly Berkeley at

05:24.682 --> 05:27.886
the time was not a hotbed of planetary astronomy. 
It was some celestial mechanics, of course, going

05:28.207 --> 05:31.791
on. How did you pick JPL, or did they come around? I 
interviewed a bunch of places. I wanted to stay in

05:37.458 --> 05:44.807
California if possible for family reasons 
predominantly, and I checked out A couple places.

05:46.535 --> 05:53.009
There were industrial places that were looking 
for astronomers then, too, although those jobs

05:46.535 --> 05:53.009
later turned out to be kind of ephemeral. What, 
like North American aviation? Aeroneutronics

05:55.435 --> 05:57.339
from Ford.

05:59.704 --> 06:05.277
Lockheed, I think, were, in general, not so much 
the time I was actually looking around. a couple

06:06.016 --> 06:09.180
other places whose names I've gracefully 
forgotten. Were those places funded by the Air

06:09.541 --> 06:15.028
Force or by NASA or what? I'm not really sure. Never 
dug into it that deeply. Probably anything they

06:17.772 --> 06:19.635
could come up with. So probably all those. Anyway, 
JPL was another one on the list, and I went down

06:20.897 --> 06:26.324
there and checked out Caltech. Greenstein had a 
postdoc available, and JPL did them sort of both in

06:26.384 --> 06:32.312
the same week. And... Of course, Greenstein would 
have been interested in me working on stars with

06:33.826 --> 06:38.852
his abundance program. And of course, JPL would 
have been, at that time, happy to get an

06:40.093 --> 06:43.437
astronomer. Who got the Greenstein thing? I don't 
remember. Probably Sargent. Or Bob O'Dell or

06:49.984 --> 06:51.165
something. O'Dell did get something down there, 
but I think that was at Carnegie, actually. It was

06:55.030 --> 06:57.252
about the same time, within a few months. The 
O'Dells and our family actually were in the same

06:58.075 --> 07:06.187
apartment complex, and the two wives met by 
accident over a clothesline. It's a funny story in

07:07.108 --> 07:08.350
itself. Okay, you arrived at JPL. Were you their 
first Ph.D. astronomer? Yeah, I think so. Of

07:16.461 --> 07:18.685
course, Ray Newbern had been there for some time 
before. Who was your boss? Was Lou Kaplan the boss

07:21.413 --> 07:22.595
there? Not yet. No, there was another guy who 
really didn't have a technical background who was

07:23.356 --> 07:27.984
the de facto section boss. But in practice, Ray was 
just about that without the stature or pay. And

07:36.198 --> 07:41.988
when you got there and looked around, what did you 
think of the place? I mean, there weren't any big

07:42.048 --> 07:43.671
telescopes or anything. No, there weren't any big 
telescopes, which created a problem that we'll

07:43.691 --> 07:47.117
talk about shortly. That was, of course, a very 
severe problem. But initially, I wasn't panicked

07:49.178 --> 07:51.000
about that. The main job I was assigned to do at 
first, supposedly halftime, but I had no idea what

07:51.040 --> 08:12.807
fractional time would be, was to coordinate an 
instrument designed by Dr. Charles Barth, who

07:51.040 --> 08:12.807
then was at JPL, a UV spectrometer, I think, to get 
ultraviolet spectra of planets from spacecraft.

08:14.409 --> 08:16.311
I'm not positive if the first one was a, A Mariner 
Venus probably was, but I'm not positive of that

08:16.544 --> 08:20.670
any longer. In any case, so I was supposed to 
coordinate Barth and his engineers and the rest of

08:21.150 --> 08:45.724
the project, which seemed like a strange role for a 
fresh PhD who didn't know ultraviolet from the

08:21.150 --> 08:45.724
bomber limit and certainly had no previous 
experience dealing with interesting and

08:21.150 --> 08:45.724
creative and, to be brutally frank about it, quite 
egotistical personalities. But you learn when

08:46.362 --> 08:48.905
you do these things. And actually, that turned out 
to be mildly interesting and took much less of my

08:48.945 --> 08:54.911
time than I thought it would. So I did actually have 
time to initiate research if I wanted to. And I did a

08:59.196 --> 09:04.902
little bit of continued work on galaxies, but I 
figured I wasn't being paid by JPL to do that. So I

09:04.962 --> 09:15.593
figured I would look into the possibilities in 
planetary astronomy in areas that I had a little

09:04.962 --> 09:15.593
bit of previous knowledge, that is spectroscopy 
of the planets, and was annoyed to find that there

09:15.893 --> 09:19.818
wasn't any modern data. There certainly was no 
prospect of more coming in, at least nothing that I

09:20.539 --> 09:25.626
would have any involvement in. And therefore, I 
turned to the old historical data, which

09:26.307 --> 09:37.141
astronomers generally keep forever, especially 
in the days where photography was the prime method

09:26.307 --> 09:37.141
of recording information. It's actually easier 
to document photographic plate files than it is to

09:38.222 --> 09:45.732
get people's CCD images in 1993. That's getting 
far afield. So in any case, I sort of fell upon the

09:47.923 --> 09:57.479
Mount Wilson plate files, and that turned out to be 
an interesting intro to planetary astronomy.

09:57.499 --> 10:08.057
These were mainly photographic spectra taken by 
Dunham and associates in the late 30s and through

09:57.499 --> 10:08.057
World War II at a relatively low pace. At which 
telescopes? Ah, sorry. Mostly at the 100-inch

10:10.303 --> 10:12.085
telescope. This is pre-200-inch, and the 
200-inch spectrograph wasn't particularly

10:12.105 --> 10:16.510
better than the 100-inch anyway. So it was 
100-inch Coudet spectra, by and large, although

10:17.031 --> 10:23.299
there were other types of spectra. But those were 
the ones that had the most recorded information

10:23.319 --> 10:30.788
and seemed to be amenable to some kind of new 
quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis.

10:37.122 --> 10:40.945
And they were done when the seeing was too poor to do 
stellar astronomy. I'm not sure if it was

10:41.245 --> 10:43.487
completely that. I mean, Dunham actually was a 
staff member. So it wasn't, I don't believe, I

10:46.290 --> 10:50.794
don't know the politics back that far precisely. 
But my guess is that he probably didn't have to beg

10:51.094 --> 10:55.058
as hard as an outsider would. But they were 
definitely not done during prime hours. Some of

10:59.842 --> 11:01.083
them were done in the daytime. I think a lot of them 
were done after the sun was down or else there would

11:03.505 --> 11:05.667
have been more scattered light on them. What did 
you get out of them? Well, I got some things which

11:07.229 --> 11:12.594
later turned out not to be quite correct, but 
nevertheless, at the time they seemed

11:07.229 --> 11:12.594
interesting. I was trying to measure the physical 
parameters of the atmosphere of Venus from a study

11:12.614 --> 11:29.631
of the carbon dioxide bands in the near-infrared, 
which at high dispersion can give you information

11:12.614 --> 11:29.631
on the rotational temperature of the CO2 gas, 
which ought to be in a high-density atmosphere

11:12.614 --> 11:29.631
equal to the kinetic temperature of the 
atmosphere at whatever optical depth is

11:30.235 --> 11:33.079
appropriate. That's a little tricky in a cloudy 
atmosphere, but neglecting that complication,

11:33.179 --> 11:47.879
it sounded like a good idea to look at whether Venus 
was hot or cold a little bit deeper in the

11:33.179 --> 11:47.879
atmosphere than infrared or such measures could 
at the time do easily. And secondarily, if you

11:48.340 --> 11:57.492
measure the line widths carefully and if there are 
no other broadening mechanisms, you can get some

11:48.340 --> 11:57.492
idea of the pressure also at the mean optical 
depth. Now the last part, I think, was done with

12:00.003 --> 12:02.966
some naivete, as you'll look back on it 30 years. 
But of course, when you started, it was better than

12:03.007 --> 12:07.652
anything else in the field. Definitely. Yes. I 
asked Bill Sinton about the Sinton band, so I've

12:10.996 --> 12:16.542
got to ask High Spinrad about the effect Spinrad. 
Oh, the Jovian line tilt. Yes. I still haven't

12:18.585 --> 12:20.387
quite figured that one out. Let me give a little 
preface on that. Why does one have to get your name

12:23.671 --> 12:27.836
attached to all things both good and bad? In any 
case... The ammonia and methane lines in the

12:31.660 --> 12:46.514
spectrum of Jupiter, when the spectrograph slit 
is placed along the equator to get the rotational

12:31.660 --> 12:46.514
velocity, turn out to be tilted approximately 
half as much as the reflected lines from the solar

12:31.660 --> 12:46.514
spectrum. The factor of two comes in basically 
just a moving mirror. And our aspect on Earth, in

12:49.817 --> 13:01.448
the simplest of geometries, when the Sun, Earth, 
and the outer planet, like Jupiter, are lined up,

12:49.817 --> 13:01.448
give you just precisely a factor of two, because 
one of the components is Sun-Jupiter. and the

13:01.681 --> 13:08.529
other Jupiter-Earth, and in the case of the 
methane and ammonia bands, which are physically

13:01.681 --> 13:08.529
from the Jovian atmosphere, you only get one of 
those. So that tilt should be a factor or two less.

13:11.172 --> 13:13.735
And on some spectra that Munch had obtained and 
perhaps... This is Guido Munch. Guido Munch, yes,

13:14.576 --> 13:18.021
professor of astronomy at Caltech at the time. It 
looked like the tilts were rather less than that,

13:19.983 --> 13:26.811
as if the ammonia wasn't co-rotating with the... 
atmospheric velocity. The trouble is the tilt was

13:28.102 --> 13:36.533
so different from a half that the velocity 
difference you predict turns out to probably be

13:28.102 --> 13:36.533
supersonic, which was a bit weird. But as an 
empiricist, I was quite willing to accept the

13:37.054 --> 13:40.559
observations. I'm not quite sure what's 
happened. But every time anybody else, including

13:43.202 --> 13:53.676
me, in future years tried to reproduce the 
observations, which again were fairly old at the

13:43.202 --> 13:53.676
time, that the strange deviation from half the 
expected tilt did not reproduce. So I've always

14:01.585 --> 14:10.058
assumed that there was some peculiarity in the way 
I measured the plates, but it doesn't really make

14:01.585 --> 14:10.058
complete sense. So I'm not 100% sure now what went 
wrong, but I'm pretty sure something did. I don't

14:13.664 --> 14:15.868
believe it's a physical effect. It drew a lot of 
attention, again, to planetary astronomy, but

14:16.589 --> 14:20.575
not necessarily for the best of reasons. Did you 
try and get Telescope Time to do New Spectrum?

14:24.150 --> 14:24.851
Yeah, sure. And that was a long and cluttered 
story, which basically was mostly unsuccessful.

14:31.709 --> 14:38.125
Well, it was obvious that one could do better by 
doing things yourself when you knew what the

14:31.709 --> 14:38.125
problem was going to be, or in many cases, with 
improved instrumentation. I mean, this is still

14:40.290 --> 14:48.388
the era of photography, but, for example, in 
near-infrared spectroscopy, four-end plates

14:40.290 --> 14:48.388
had replaced one-ends, and those had much higher 
acuity. And generally, just the idea of doing

14:49.149 --> 14:56.265
something yourself when you know what was 
happening at the telescope is better than going

14:49.149 --> 14:56.265
down to some archaic file and not knowing all 
circumstances except what's written on the

14:56.684 --> 15:01.210
envelope of the plate. So at first I made casual 
approaches to various observers and observatory

15:01.230 --> 15:15.170
directors at Mount Wilson, at McDonald, back at 
Lick, old stomping grounds. And these were not

15:15.751 --> 15:22.000
greeted generally with much enthusiasm for 
perhaps several reasons I'm not positive which

15:22.638 --> 15:24.641
ones were the most important. Planetary 
astronomy still was not considered part of

15:25.242 --> 15:40.383
mainstream astronomy, and I think this was 
probably the largest factor in the sense that

15:25.242 --> 15:40.383
directors and other people that ran 
observatories were worried perhaps about

15:25.242 --> 15:40.383
wasting valuable observing time. So in other 
words, real astronomers looked down on planetary

15:40.403 --> 15:43.788
astronomy. Yeah, for better or for worse, that was 
the case at the very beginning of the space age. I

15:48.154 --> 15:51.058
mean, obviously it evolved, but initially that 
was true. Were you ever told you made your choice

15:51.190 --> 15:54.555
between money and telescope time? Not in writing. 
But orally? Yeah. And we're slightly more

15:58.722 --> 16:02.447
diplomatic than that. I won't, in fact, mention 
the person that said it the most bluntly, because

16:02.928 --> 16:10.379
it's a guy you don't even know. But yeah, I was told 
that, and it was painful. JPL, of course, for those

16:13.845 --> 16:19.273
uninitiated, paid a lot more than a low-level 
academic job. starting salaries at JPL were twice

16:19.743 --> 16:30.593
that of a postdoc and probably, I'm just guessing, 
40 or 50% higher than an assistant professor would

16:19.743 --> 16:30.593
have been at the same time. So for a fresh PhD, it was 
a lot of money. Now, technically, JPL was a part of

16:34.076 --> 16:39.021
Caltech. Yes. But practically, it was not. Is that 
correct? Yes, there was a vast chasm that

16:42.264 --> 16:49.210
separated the

16:42.264 --> 16:49.210
stature, so to speak, of JPL scientists with 
Caltech Science. In some cases, that was at least

16:52.689 --> 16:55.472
true, in some areas. That wasn't true in every 
endeavor. I think the people that did radio and

16:58.195 --> 17:07.127
radar astronomy were considered colleagues of 
equal footing, perhaps. But in any case, yes,

17:07.207 --> 17:18.741
Caltech was not a cooperative partner in any sense 
of the word, with one major exception, and that was

17:07.207 --> 17:18.741
the influence of Gito Munch, professor of 
astronomy at Caltech. Gito, for his own personal

17:21.779 --> 17:31.028
interests, was interested in a variety of topics, 
very, very broad person, and one of those was

17:21.779 --> 17:31.028
planetary astronomy. So on his own, he was doing a 
fair amount of observing of planets, but even more

17:31.728 --> 17:40.356
importantly, from my own personal viewpoint, he 
was around as a pseudo-mentor. I mean, he's the

17:40.697 --> 17:44.780
last person on Earth that would probably like to be 
accused of being a good teacher. But in any case,

17:46.902 --> 17:50.126
Like it or not, he was in his own strange way. You 
were reduced to looking for water vapor on planets

17:52.429 --> 17:57.716
at Victoria, British Columbia, were you not? 
Excellent choice, wouldn't you think? All right,

18:00.620 --> 18:02.122
so that's a long story. Any case, let me make it 
quite abbreviated. Water on Mars is a long, long

18:04.825 --> 18:12.235
story, which, in fact, you have documented well.

18:14.965 --> 18:22.562
My own interest in that came, again, just from 
reading the review papers by Richardson, Dunham,

18:14.965 --> 18:22.562
and other folks. And then the first attempts to try 
to observe water from balloon altitudes by, I

18:23.203 --> 18:30.360
think, Dollfuss, actually, was the first, 
perhaps, to be successful. And people had thought

18:30.801 --> 18:32.805
about this before. And there have been attempts at 
Lowell Observatory also. The trick, of course, is

18:36.229 --> 18:43.879
to have a dry site on Earth and or a Doppler shift to 
move out the telluric lines from the Martian ones.

18:43.919 --> 18:54.853
The Mars lines, obviously, were going to be very 
weak since we know there's not very much water on

18:43.919 --> 18:54.853
Mars if you spread out the polar caps, assuming 
that they're half water or something like that.

18:54.873 --> 18:58.919
You don't get a lot of water in the atmosphere at the 
temperatures relevant to Mars. So I tried to get

19:00.381 --> 19:02.303
time at Mount Wilson. And that would have required 
using the 100 inch. The snow telescope, which I did

19:07.052 --> 19:15.025
use for Venus, was inadequate even for Venus, 
unfortunately. It was OK for getting a spectrum of

19:15.245 --> 19:17.048
the sun, however. I learned a little bit by using 
it. But that was as much as the observatory

19:19.272 --> 19:24.560
committee and Director Bowen was willing to give 
to me. So I asked other places at Lick. I got a polite

19:30.059 --> 19:59.205
reply from Director Albert Whitford, who 
remarked that they had just gotten their big

19:30.059 --> 19:59.205
telescope, the three-meter, what's called the 
Shane, but now the Shane, a three-meter

19:30.059 --> 19:59.205
telescope, had just gone on the air there, and they 
had been second-rate citizens to the Mount Wilson

19:30.059 --> 19:59.205
Palomar folks for so long that they weren't 
anxious to give time away to, quote, Caltech,

19:30.059 --> 19:59.205
unquote, and Whitford remarked that I should try 
here. Which is a logical thing to say. He wasn't

20:03.011 --> 20:04.813
trying to be particularly mean about it. It was 
very defensible. Nevertheless, nothing came of

20:07.396 --> 20:08.537
that. I tried also, I think, that early at 
McDonald's, but I'm not positive it was really at

20:10.839 --> 20:15.184
that time. Was this before Harlan took over? Oh, 
yes. When Kuiper was still director. I think

20:19.888 --> 20:22.071
actually I had to do it through the University of 
Chicago. Maybe I didn't, but I did. In any case, it

20:23.952 --> 20:26.475
was definitely before Harlan Smith. Well, let's 
continue on that now. So I ended up then finding

20:28.203 --> 20:39.326
out, I don't remember who told me, that they had a 
new 40-inch telescope, 48-inch telescope at

20:28.203 --> 20:39.326
Victoria, British Columbia, which is, of course, 
an insane place to go looking for water. Well, you

20:39.827 --> 20:41.430
find it very locally. Yes, you can hardly avoid it. 
But even on a clear night, it's not particularly

20:42.873 --> 20:45.498
dry. It's about as wet a side as you can. And it's far 
north, too. It's far north. Elevation is about 100

20:48.680 --> 20:50.222
meters. It's a real wet place. On the other hand, 
they've got a good telescope and a nice modern

20:52.326 --> 20:56.432
spectrograph that had been built by Harvey 
Richardson. So I got some time there with no more

20:57.113 --> 21:05.166
difficulty than suggesting a collaboration with 
Richardson, who had a mild interest in planetary

20:57.113 --> 21:05.166
work. And I don't know why they gave me time, but 
they did. I think it was something like a couple

21:11.849 --> 21:20.142
weeks a year, which was a heck of a lot for their 
second most powerful telescope and certainly

21:11.849 --> 21:20.142
their modern telescope. So we got some 
observations despite the usual difficulties

21:21.264 --> 21:25.690
with weather up there. Not good enough to find 
water on Mars or Venus, but we got some good enough

21:26.171 --> 21:36.507
spectra to be interesting and to whet everybody's 
appetite and to show that modern spectra, after we

21:26.171 --> 21:36.507
learned how to you know, walk and climb a bit 
ourselves, we're clearly going to be superior to

21:36.605 --> 21:43.292
the material from the 30s and 40s. No surprise. 
Now, probably next comes the Kaplan, Munch, and

21:44.794 --> 21:52.543
Spinrad work, or Kaplan's team, as it was called, 
which was your idea, but will you explain how that

21:44.794 --> 21:52.543
got going? Sure. Now we're going to... 1963? Yeah, 
the observation was made on April 12, 1963. I

22:03.195 --> 22:05.177
remember it very distinctly, of course. for a 
variety of egotistical reasons. In fact, I told my

22:10.400 --> 22:16.589
current students in 1993 that there was an 
anniversary that had something to do with Mars.

22:16.649 --> 22:17.971
And I was waiting for them to guess it. No one did. It 
was very humbling. So yesterday's prize is long

22:21.816 --> 22:25.101
forgotten. What have you done for us lately? Yes. 
Well, anyway, this got started by a continuation.

22:30.749 --> 22:36.717
We realized that observing from Victoria wasn't 
the smartest way to look for a minuscule amount of

22:30.749 --> 22:36.717
water on Mars. We had no idea, of course, that we 
could detect Martian CO2. Never entered a

22:41.000 --> 22:43.162
conversation. It was all argon in the atmosphere 
of Mars. Nitrogen and argon. Nitrogen and argon,

22:46.005 --> 22:47.286
yeah. No, there was the CO2 detection, but it was so 
small, we thought, that in the obstacle band,

22:47.306 --> 22:53.332
there was no prayer. So it never entered a 
conversation. So everything was optimized for

22:55.153 --> 23:02.020
the H2O band at 8,200 angstroms, which was 
stronger than the one we observed at Victoria. We

23:02.040 --> 23:03.721
did the 7,200 angstrom region. I don't remember 
why. I think the glaze of the grating or something

23:04.622 --> 23:06.484
like that. And then Guido insisted that we use 
forend plates, partly because he wanted to find

23:07.426 --> 23:16.222
out how fast it could be after you hyped them. Where 
did you stumble on this hyperization with ammonia

23:16.242 --> 23:21.672
as opposed to cold water that Mount Wilson used? It 
had been around for a while. I don't know who

23:22.974 --> 23:23.896
invented it. It had been in the folklore before 
Guido, but I had not used it. I don't know who heard

23:31.490 --> 23:35.056
about it, but Munch knew a bit more about it than I. 
Whose idea was it to go after Mars, that particular

23:35.396 --> 23:42.227
maximum Doppler show? No, that was mine. Okay. 
Just a natural carryover from the victorious

23:43.970 --> 23:45.853
time. And then you what? You broached it to Guido 
and he used it? Yeah, and he had time coming up, so it

23:48.917 --> 23:50.840
was all his time. We didn't get any new time or 
special director's discretion for it or not. On

23:53.945 --> 23:55.708
the other hand, Munch wasn't about it. to have 
anybody push him off the telescope for any reason.

23:58.651 --> 23:59.853
I mean, it was his time, man. He'd do what he darn 
well pleased, senor. And how did Luke Kaplan get

24:02.297 --> 24:04.240
involved in it? Kaplan was in the game. At that 
time, he was then the section leader on the basis of

24:06.644 --> 24:11.453
encouragement. I mean, he was an advocate of doing 
these things, as well as preparing for space

24:11.473 --> 24:16.602
experiments. And what happened, fortunately, is 
that Munch and I went up to the mountain. Guido

24:24.409 --> 24:27.293
showed me how to use the 100-inch Coudet, which 
wasn't all that trivial. I felt slightly

24:28.754 --> 24:30.777
overwhelmed, but we used it. And the first night, 
we tried a one-end plate on Mars. It was a pretty

24:35.041 --> 24:35.862
good night. And it came out all right, but it wasn't 
anything outstanding. Then we tried a four-end

24:38.225 --> 24:44.292
that we had hyped that afternoon, and it was 
useless because we had overexposed it. It was too

24:44.652 --> 24:45.613
sensitive. We figured it was going to be less 
sensitive than the one-end, but it was actually

24:45.653 --> 24:49.017
more sensitive. So that was useless. Which was not 
the party line. It was not the conventional

24:51.461 --> 24:52.485
wisdom. Well, if you don't hype them, it's down a 
factor of 50, roughly. So the hypersensitization

24:56.798 --> 24:59.949
was extraordinarily effective. I mean, it's an 
art, like grinding up lizards. Here are my scars

25:03.121 --> 25:05.625
from McDonald. Yes, that's right. When you do this 
in the dark, besides sniffing the ammonia, it's

25:07.427 --> 25:14.717
subject to occasional failure of all sorts. I 
mean, the blood doesn't really help much. Okay, so

25:16.640 --> 25:18.082
you're on your second night now. Yeah, the second 
night, Guido had left. Guido had other activities

25:21.387 --> 25:28.597
besides astronomy and didn't want to stay up in the 
mountain for the whole run, which I think was

25:21.387 --> 25:28.597
actually scheduled for four nights. This is now 
April 12, 1963. So I exposed a forend plate to Mars

25:32.821 --> 25:38.349
for, I don't know, over the order of three hours. I 
don't remember the exact exposure time. And we got

25:41.614 --> 25:43.797
a spectrogram, and I was going to start another 
one. Mars was at quadrature, of course, to get the

25:45.700 --> 25:49.806
velocity, but I guess it was far enough north that 
you could do more than one. So I started the next

25:50.848 --> 25:53.592
one, and it clouded up. So I had plenty of time to go 
in and develop a plate, waiting for the clouds to go

25:54.253 --> 25:59.841
away or Mars to set or whatever was going to happen. 
And I looked at it, and I could tell it was a good

26:00.513 --> 26:02.235
plate. Even then, slightly overexposed, but not 
much. Had fairly good spatial resolution, good

26:04.739 --> 26:11.708
spectral resolution, nice contrast on a forend, 
which is one of the reasons you use it. And then

26:12.749 --> 26:19.719
basically, I put it aside and said, hey, I'll get a 
few of these, and we'll look at them, or we'll add

26:12.749 --> 26:19.719
them all up, or do something terribly clever. No 
one had thought of digital things then, of course,

26:20.159 --> 26:25.587
because it was still analog type of analysis. And I 
put it away. Well, unfortunately, it wasn't just

26:28.407 --> 26:30.069
clouds. The next day it got colder and colder, and 
finally it started snowing. So the rest of the run

26:34.173 --> 26:35.634
was wiped out. I came home kind of disconsolate, 
having one probably pretty good plate, but I don't

26:37.436 --> 26:44.143
know. I didn't see anything in the hypo, so I didn't 
make a big deal of it and sort of got on with my life

26:44.183 --> 26:49.808
for a couple days. After a few days, I said, oh, my, 
let's look at the thing and see if at least we can see

26:49.908 --> 26:56.575
the water lines visually, and maybe they'll show 
up. By golly, I think they did, especially over one

26:57.618 --> 27:02.544
third of the exposure. I'm not sure I knew exactly 
which way it was up at the time. I had to figure out

27:05.728 --> 27:07.510
which polar cap it was. But they were there. But the 
outstanding thing was not noticed until about a

27:09.913 --> 27:14.479
week later. And for some reason, I decided to 
compare the spectrum of Mars to a Venus spectrum

27:15.300 --> 27:24.351
that I had from the same instrument taken by Dunham 
a long time ago. And of course, the quality of the

27:24.618 --> 27:28.403
new one, especially on a 4N, was far greater. But 
the nice thing about the Venus old spectrum was

27:28.704 --> 27:35.834
that it showed me where the 8689 carbon dioxide 
band was located. And by golly, when I looked at the

27:36.375 --> 27:39.219
Mars spectrum, there were the lines. Much, much 
weaker, but unmistakable. And you could match

27:43.305 --> 27:45.067
them line for line. Yeah, it just blew me away. So I 
went hooping and hollering around the trailers.

27:50.453 --> 27:52.595
found Kaplan right away, had him look at it. He 
wasn't much used to looking at spectra, but he

27:52.615 --> 27:54.938
could see it, too. And then called up Guido. He 
refused to believe it for a few minutes. I don't

28:00.264 --> 28:03.287
remember if he came up to look the same afternoon or 
the next day. But we knew right away that that meant

28:04.188 --> 28:12.477
that there was more carbon dioxide on Mars than 
people had reckoned before by a lot. Because this

28:13.458 --> 28:15.981
was intrinsically not- It's a weak band. It 
doesn't depend very much on the gas pressure.

28:18.770 --> 28:21.774
Total gas pressure is mostly just dependent on the 
column of carbon dioxide. So it's an unavoidable

28:22.194 --> 28:26.460
conclusion that there had to be more CO2. So either 
there had to be more atmosphere on Mars than anyone

28:26.840 --> 28:33.729
thought, or the atmosphere, if thin, had to be 
predominantly carbon dioxide. And those were

28:33.749 --> 28:37.914
conclusions one could work out in your head 
without even calculating a number. So that was

28:39.436 --> 28:44.923
KMS-1, which got published on January 1, 1964. How 
did the JPL publicity department handle this? I

28:48.503 --> 28:50.847
can't remember. I think there was some interest in 
it. As you recall, you got a pressure of, what was

28:52.850 --> 28:57.417
it, finally? 25. 25 millibars. 25 plus or minus. 
And the standard Girard de Bacallure is 80-ish?

29:04.669 --> 29:07.874
Yeah, 84 plus or minus 5 or 85 plus or minus 4. I could 
check that out. But they were already designing

29:09.536 --> 29:13.082
entry capsules for the 85 millibar. Yeah, right. 
That was just about happening that way for, what

29:14.043 --> 29:16.367
was it, The first entry, well, Mariner 4, of 
course, was supposed to be a flyby. It was a flyby.

29:21.099 --> 29:24.123
First entry was a ways downstream, but clearly 
they needed to know that. So what did this do to

29:25.605 --> 29:29.090
planetary astronomy? Well, as soon as anybody 
believed it, which happened actually pretty

29:30.092 --> 29:38.023
quickly, because Owen and Kuiper got confirming 
observations relatively quickly. I don't

29:38.384 --> 29:40.106
remember if it was exactly the same season. How 
long between quadratures? Six? Not that long.

29:45.955 --> 29:46.977
Maybe they got it on the other side. I don't know. It 
might not have been that season. Four months?

29:49.401 --> 29:49.801
Yeah. Or maybe six. But anyway, it wasn't a real 
long time. So it got confirmed like in a year or

29:53.327 --> 29:55.290
less. And then people definitely were taking it 
seriously. Re-examining old archives and mostly

29:59.316 --> 30:09.752
re-examining the assumptions that went into the 
surface pressure determinations. Which then,

30:10.634 --> 30:11.515
look, the after a while, a lot weaker than they had 
in 1963. Now, you recall that I was at headquarters

30:15.762 --> 30:23.372
during some of this time from 63 in June to 
September in 64. And during that time, John Strong

30:23.512 --> 30:40.033
came in with a balloon flight that found an 
enormous amount of, well, many times more water

30:23.512 --> 30:40.033
vapor in the atmosphere of Mars than you did,

30:23.512 --> 30:40.033
which caused great consternation at 
headquarters. And at least in headquarters, the

30:40.402 --> 30:46.390
people who weren't spectroscopists said, well, 
we don't know who to believe. What did you think

30:47.832 --> 30:48.653
about it? Well, you know, water can be temporal up 
to a point, right? So you could imagine changes.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.804
But, you know, I was a relatively brash young man. I 
tend to believe what I do. Well, he had something

30:58.486 --> 31:02.511
like 85...

31:03.537 --> 31:04.859
What units did we used to use? Precipitable 
microns, I think. Great unit. Averaged over the

31:07.785 --> 31:09.348
entire disk. Yeah, enormously higher. I would 
have said 10 or 15 over the North Pole. I think

31:12.714 --> 31:13.876
that's what we did say. Okay, now, when I got back to 
headquarters, that was that Harlan Smith was now

31:15.078 --> 31:27.621
in high gear at the University of Texas, and he and I 
had started the 107-inch, and as I recall, You and I

31:28.006 --> 31:31.010
got a run at McDonald's. 82-inch. 82-inch, which 
lasted a month. Yeah, it was incredible. And I

31:35.775 --> 31:40.881
guess I got there a week or so earlier because the 
picture graph was in pieces. Right. You put it

31:41.322 --> 31:42.864
together completely. I never got in that stage. It 
was probably more than a week. That was December of

31:47.669 --> 31:51.394
64, I think. Yeah, that's right. When you first 
heard of this, how did... I forget now how this

31:56.379 --> 31:57.921
went. I mean, who did Harlan call? You or me or both 
of us? I don't know if I know. Probably both of us.

32:03.106 --> 32:17.681
And then I recall I was upstairs guiding or 
ammoniating or developing or something, and I

32:03.106 --> 32:17.681
came down, and you and Harlan were outside the 
library at the 82-inch arranging the observing

32:03.106 --> 32:17.681
schedule for the next year, which must have been a 
very unusual situation for you. What about face?

32:18.242 --> 32:18.983
Famine to feast? Completely unusual. It doesn't 
happen now either, believe me. Would you say that

32:22.799 --> 32:34.481
for a long time, McDonald was the only place where 
it was not only safe, not only popular, but even

32:22.799 --> 32:34.481
safe to do planetary astronomy? Well, it was all 
changing. By 64 and 65, while it might not have been

32:35.623 --> 32:45.542
the focus of everyone's pride and attention, it 
was no longer in the closet, so to speak. Mm-hmm.

32:47.048 --> 33:02.348
And by the time I got back to Berkeley as a faculty 
member, which was in February 64, and then I could

32:47.048 --> 33:02.348
use Lick, an automatic write, I could ask for coup 
d'etat time to do whatever darn well I pleased, and

32:47.048 --> 33:02.348
I did. So I worked on Venus and Mars at Lick. In fact, 
some of our joint paper on the Mars water and CO2 for

33:04.711 --> 33:11.460
that opposition comes from Lick, and a little bit 
more from McDonald's. So it was okay. I mean, I

33:12.621 --> 33:15.005
don't know if people cared one way or the other 
then. I think it was clear then that exploring the

33:17.423 --> 33:21.148
planets was going to be interesting, both from the 
ground and from spacecraft. So it just wasn't as

33:21.629 --> 33:29.220
hot culture to look down your nose at planetary 
astronomy. So that was beginning to change. But on

33:31.444 --> 33:34.688
the other hand, McDonald was a place that one could 
really do a lot. I mean, at Lick, Herbig would get a

33:35.169 --> 33:39.055
few spectra every year and then actually tire of 
it. And I did it for a few years. And Larry Giver, as a

33:42.039 --> 33:44.863
student, did a little bit with Herbig. But other 
than that, there wasn't a lot of planetary

33:44.883 --> 33:46.806
astronomy. And then, of course, Kid Peek started 
coming in, so people like Toby Owen. Exactly. Now,

33:51.915 --> 33:54.501
Kid Peek didn't have all the prejudices of the 
past. They didn't have that excess strange

33:54.601 --> 33:57.327
baggage. The only thing Kid Peek might have had a 
little prejudice against, but I don't think it

33:57.347 --> 34:01.015
really ever showed, was a Kuiper-type jealousy 
when Kuiper was across the street at U of A. But I

34:05.289 --> 34:06.210
don't think that mattered much. And Kuiper had his 
slightly smaller telescopes on northeast of

34:06.250 --> 34:12.501
Tucson. So by then, the observational effect was 
getting pretty good. I mean, the observational

34:16.127 --> 34:17.390
situation was unique. Yeah, but McDonald was a 
unique thing at first. The first years of the

34:18.892 --> 34:26.445
82-inch Kudai, and then you know more about the 
107-inch, which actually I've never used. than I,

34:27.404 --> 34:29.887
but that was a wonderful opportunity. So it went 
from famine to feast. Why did you leave JPL? Oh,

34:33.951 --> 34:56.213
partly because of the frustration of not having a 
telescope that I could say I had a real bite on, and

34:33.951 --> 34:56.213
partly for family reasons to get back in the Bay 
Area, and partly because I was more interested in

34:33.951 --> 34:56.213
having an academic-type career than one at a place 
where things were a little bit more regimented.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.403
Although JPL, I'd say in general, treated me quite 
well. I was probably treated better than the

34:59.603 --> 35:09.953
average scientist there that was supposed to have 
a functional job to help coordinate spacecraft

34:59.603 --> 35:09.953
things between engineers and scientists, for 
example. And they ended up doing 10% functional

35:09.973 --> 35:13.096
work instead of 50%. So I can't complain about 
that. But the environment was not quite what I had

35:14.978 --> 35:21.225
wanted to do for the rest of my career. So in 64, I 
moved from From Pasadena. Why did you slowly drift

35:27.123 --> 35:31.448
out of planetary work? Because there are 
opportunities all over. I'm interested in the

35:32.929 --> 35:34.291
whole universe. I still do cometary work. One of my 
students is working on Io. So I did it indirectly.

35:43.021 --> 35:44.162
I'm never completely out of it. I certainly don't 
do it full time. And I'm not up with the literature

35:45.464 --> 35:49.348
the way I might have been at one time. But it's part 
of the universe that I enjoy. And it's near enough

35:52.171 --> 35:54.634
that you can use different techniques. If the 
techniques get too easy or the spacecraft do it

35:54.867 --> 36:02.217
all, then clearly I would look for something a 
little more challenging. Just as a little

36:02.417 --> 36:09.266
personal aside, what was your first meeting with 
Harlan Smith and how did he impress you?

36:11.750 --> 36:21.803
I corresponded with Smitty about RLR stars a 
little bit because he did his thesis on light

36:11.750 --> 36:21.803
curves of RLR stars, I believe, or something like 
that at Yale. And I was interested in doing that as a

36:23.082 --> 36:38.060
student project under the direction, to some 
extent, of George Preston when I was a second-year

36:23.082 --> 36:38.060
graduate student before I knew the names of the 
satellites of Saturn or what Gibbous meant.

36:41.425 --> 36:44.248
I don't know when I met him first physically. Well, 
he certainly wasn't like your typical Mount

36:45.329 --> 36:49.434
Wilson Palomar director, was he? No, no. Smitty 
was a very open... not necessarily wearing a tie

36:51.922 --> 36:59.392
and stiff shirt type person, would never have 
known he was an observatory director. While the

37:00.373 --> 37:12.610
prototypical director of the early 60s was 
someone that had grown up in an earlier time and was

37:00.373 --> 37:12.610
much more formal than that. What was planetary 
astronomy like when you started in 61 and 62?

37:21.402 --> 37:51.105
small in some disrepute but with you know with 
enough promise just because it hadn't been

37:21.402 --> 37:51.105
attacked very much that it looked interesting and 
also of course the prospect of getting direct

37:21.402 --> 37:51.105
information from the space probes if they had ever 
worked at the time when i started in 61 nothing was

37:21.402 --> 37:51.105
working and rangers were crashing into the moon 
and you know couldn't get to the moon successfully

37:21.402 --> 37:51.105
let alone mars or venus so it looked like it might be 
a bit of a long haul but clearly the impetus was

37:21.402 --> 37:51.105
there was a national goal to to the moon and beyond. 
So I figured that there would be lots of

37:52.895 --> 37:59.767
opportunities in non-traditional astronomy, if 
not the traditional. But of course, it turned out

37:59.827 --> 38:03.573
the traditional was still wide open also. What do 
you think is the best piece of work in planetary

38:03.633 --> 38:07.860
astronomy you've done? We're going to chisel on a 
tombstone. Oh, my.

38:13.530 --> 38:16.755
Certainly the most dramatic and the part I can 
relive if I feel self-depressed is that detection

38:17.258 --> 38:22.386
of CO2 on the Mars spectrogram. That was the one 
moment where it all flashed in front of you. As soon

38:26.172 --> 38:36.929
as I saw the lines, believed they were real, I knew 
in less time than it takes the neurons to move

38:26.172 --> 38:36.929
around, I guess, that this was important because 
there was a lot more CO2 than people had thought.

38:36.949 --> 38:39.393
And actually working out the detailed surface 
pressure took a little while. That, I think, is the

38:40.154 --> 38:44.160
flashiest thing. It turned out to be more or less 
right. What was the most fun? That or something

38:49.443 --> 38:50.705
else? Well, that was fun instantaneously. I don't 
know. All of it's fun. All of it's fun. We already

38:56.071 --> 39:00.296
talked about dead ends or misfires, so we'll skip 
that question. Lots of those. I mean, working on

39:01.578 --> 39:03.360
comets now is a lot of fun. They're pretty 
fascinating. You can get surprises. Comets were

39:07.024 --> 39:10.809
always acceptable. Isn't that strange? Even in 
the 20s and 30s. I wonder why. I mean, the physics

39:15.374 --> 39:20.499
was a little bit more like stellar or gaseous 
nebulae astrophysics, a little bit. The people

39:21.439 --> 39:27.765
that did the laboratory stuff and 
identifications for comets were well-regarded

39:21.439 --> 39:27.765
folks. Phillips did C2 and Cn. Identifications of 
other things were by Swings, who certainly was a

39:31.949 --> 39:38.556
famous and extremely well-regarded astronomer, 
no matter what he did. I don't know if that's the

39:38.576 --> 39:40.378
reason or not. No, you weren't a pariah if you 
worked on comets. I mean, Greenstein did it in

39:43.540 --> 39:45.362
1956. Nobody seemed to mind. Have

39:48.105 --> 39:57.375
you had any direct NSA funding since you left JPL? 
Yeah, yeah. How have they treated you? I mean,

40:00.619 --> 40:01.880
normally. Do you think the folks at headquarters 
or whoever's handling your stuff understand what

40:02.961 --> 40:06.966
you're doing? Do they keep up with this? Yeah, 
because Rahe is the program director. And when I'm

40:10.777 --> 40:17.905
working on comments, he probably knows almost as 
much about the specific subject as I. I've been

40:10.777 --> 40:17.905
treated well by them in recent years. So no gripes 
about mismanagement, I mean, micromanagement or

40:19.226 --> 40:23.371
anything like that? Not at all, no. Do they try and 
tell you what to do? Nope. Not now.

40:32.060 --> 40:35.103
I mean, you know, I get review remarks from the 
committees. The scientific review committees

40:35.263 --> 40:38.107
aren't always flattering. But that's normal, 
isn't it? Right, yeah. Where do you think

40:41.000 --> 40:48.008
planetary astronomy would be today without NASA?

40:48.028 --> 40:50.491
It's very hard to tell whether it would have ever 
caught on again. It would have. Somebody would

40:51.532 --> 40:56.998
have blundered across something by accident that 
would have turned it around. But it might have

40:57.058 --> 40:59.221
taken a long, long time. I mean, it was in a deep well 
for not its own fault for some years. And it's very

41:03.866 --> 41:04.747
hard to say. But for NASA, in its own 
blunderbuss-type approach, I think it helped.

41:11.189 --> 41:17.357
Which brings me to the point, all the participants 
are dead, so all we've got is the opinions of live

41:11.189 --> 41:17.357
people. What do you think killed astronomy, 
basically killed as an active field? I know there

41:21.944 --> 41:26.650
was a little bit done in the 20s and 30s and 40s in 
planetary astronomy. But it was a moribund field.

41:28.352 --> 41:30.095
And at the turn of the century, it was not. Was it 
that other fields opened up, or that they ran into

41:31.156 --> 41:40.048
instrumental barriers, like no good infrared 
detectors, or just what? It's hard to say.

41:41.850 --> 41:42.551
Percival Lowell? Lowell did something, but that 
was earlier. I don't think that should have had an

41:45.315 --> 41:50.022
effect from, say, the 40s through 1960. But there 
were so few people of confidence in the field in the

41:52.006 --> 41:57.714
late 50s. I mean, Kuiper and who else was there? 
Chamberlain was just getting started. I don't

42:02.401 --> 42:06.788
know if he was a full-fledged planetary 
astronomer or would have called himself that or

42:02.401 --> 42:06.788
something else. Who else was outstanding in 
planetary astronomy. Erpik did a lot of other

42:09.316 --> 42:10.557
things. He did some planetary astronomy that was 
good, but of course in the States that didn't get

42:10.598 --> 42:15.063
recognition at the time. And swings, of course, in 
Europe, but that was a part-time affair for him. I

42:23.033 --> 42:23.353
don't know. I mean, Kuiper, of course, had a 
reputation that was antagonistic, so people

42:23.393 --> 42:30.262
didn't like him personally in some cases. That may 
have played some role, but basically I'm not quite

42:30.822 --> 42:34.487
sure I can put my finger on it, but Certainly other 
fields of astronomy and astrophysics seem to have

42:34.855 --> 42:42.843
more simplistic and direct physical answers. The 
problems are tough on planets. I mean, in the case

42:44.444 --> 42:52.632
of the rocky planets, I'll include Mars mostly in 
that, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and then the small

42:44.444 --> 42:52.632
things. Basically, it was thought that only 
geologists could have an impact there. And then

42:55.675 --> 43:00.500
the atmosphere of Venus was, well, studied by 
Dunham and Adams. And they found CO2. And what can

43:02.041 --> 43:03.883
you do after that? So I don't know. The field was 
thought to be sterile. New techniques hadn't

43:07.724 --> 43:11.569
advanced to the point where they could make a big 
contribution. For example, if we had infrared

43:11.589 --> 43:22.503
detectors of high quality and infrared 
spectrometers in 1960, the way we do in 1990

43:11.589 --> 43:22.503
something, clearly that would have opened up a lot 
of doors. But it seemed to be a combination. I'm not

43:27.469 --> 43:30.833
sure there's a terribly easy explanation for it. 
I've been asking certain people particularly

43:31.184 --> 43:50.985
about the formation of the DPS and Icarus, but this 
holds for all fields of astronomy in this country

43:31.184 --> 43:50.985
where 30 years ago all we had was an American 
Astronomical Society basically, and then we had

43:31.184 --> 43:50.985
the APJ and the AJ, and that was kind of it. ASP. ASP, 
right. That was very local, though. But that was

43:53.247 --> 43:54.148
about it. Now we have these separate divisions of 
the American Astronomical Society, and most of

43:54.468 --> 44:00.735
them, or a lot of them, with their own journals. Is 
this good or bad? I still cling to the outmoded

44:05.978 --> 44:15.368
thought that it would be nice to be such a 
sufficiently good generalist that you could know

44:05.978 --> 44:15.368
a fair amount about everything. For example, in 
today's AAS meeting program, Schneider gave a

44:16.670 --> 44:26.841
talk on the Io Taurus and Io volcanoes, and there 
was a very, very good audience of mostly

44:16.670 --> 44:26.841
non-planetary people. So there's still some 
semblance of people wanting at least no

44:26.861 --> 44:30.705
highlights about everything. So in a way, it would 
be nice to have everything in a couple of journals

44:31.462 --> 44:36.708
because one's office isn't big enough to take them 
all now. But the journals would be thicker now. But

44:37.929 --> 44:40.031
the journals would be thicker and unmanageable. 
So I don't know. I still think it's kind of

44:42.053 --> 44:47.980
unfortunate that we have to specialize, but 
there's no choice. We can survive this way, too. In

44:50.282 --> 44:55.588
the so-called good old days, did stellar and 
planetary astronomers ever talk to each other

44:50.282 --> 44:55.588
anyway? I think some of them did.

45:00.773 --> 45:12.366
Well, here's a good question, which your point 
about the talk about the EOTR has brought up, and

45:00.773 --> 45:12.366
this has to do with AAS having invited review 
papers. Do you think that because of things like

45:12.446 --> 45:27.842
that and a perhaps more open attitude on both sides 
than we had 30 years ago that, for example,

45:12.446 --> 45:27.842
planetary and real astronomers talk more than 
they used to 30 years ago, or less, or about the

45:12.446 --> 45:27.842
same? Probably more. For example, there's a large 
interest in the folks that do star formation in the

45:30.659 --> 45:45.517
early solar system now, because they're trying to 
find analogs of the early solar system in the

45:30.659 --> 45:45.517
Taurus cloud and other obscured places, 
molecular clouds where young stars form. So

45:45.877 --> 45:52.325
they're quite interested in planetary astronomy 
at some level, maybe not in the geology of every

45:45.877 --> 45:52.325
rock on Mars or the moon. But at some level, they're 
definitely interested. So I think, in fact,

45:54.687 --> 45:56.970
things are a little bit better And there's 
moderately good communication. So I think having

46:00.572 --> 46:08.942
invited talks on subjects where there's overlap 
is very healthy and probably successful. So AAS in

46:09.563 --> 46:14.769
its biannual meeting is, to some extent, doing 
that. I don't know if the planetary division ever

46:14.809 --> 46:18.613
has a talk. I think they do, by people interested, 
for example, in star formation, which is at least

46:19.114 --> 46:27.023
indirectly related to planetary formation. That 
happens sometimes. You think a planetary

46:28.372 --> 46:30.576
astronomy is a part of astronomy? Sure. I might 
have a minority view on that. Yeah, it is. It is. A

46:36.325 --> 46:37.747
lot of the techniques are the same. A lot of them are 
different. If you go to the DPS, you don't hear a

46:39.750 --> 46:45.880
tremendous amount about other fields of 
astronomy, but you do hear something. Yeah, I

46:47.963 --> 46:55.375
think scientists now are multidisciplined 
enough in their brains to realize that a sharp

46:47.963 --> 46:55.375
division is artificial. Well, I know the DPS, I've 
seen coronagraph pictures of some nearby stars.

47:00.162 --> 47:00.984
Yeah, sure. Absolutely. This, again, is a 
personal thing, but I'm going to try and build up a

47:03.210 --> 47:07.643
consensus.
