WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:06.354
Testing, testing, testing, one, two, three, 
four. One, two, three, four. This is December

00:09.777 --> 00:25.996
15th, and we're in San Antonio, and I have the joy 
and pleasure of chatting with an old friend, Clark

00:09.777 --> 00:25.996
Munro, who spells his last name M-U-N-R-O-E. As 
far as we know, we are not related. And to begin

00:27.097 --> 00:31.422
with, Clark, would you introduce yourself to this 
tape or the transcription, anyone who would read

00:32.060 --> 00:39.467
it, describe family background, where you grew 
up. Tell a biographical summary before you got to

00:40.068 --> 00:44.772
Texas A&M the first time. All right. I was raised in 
Pennsylvania, small town, 250 people. One of four

00:53.921 --> 00:56.323
children, three boys and a girl. My father was a 
small town banker. We lived there until World War

01:01.760 --> 01:04.502
II started. He was commissioned in the Army during 
World War II. He'd been at World War I. And he ended

01:13.411 --> 01:18.395
up coming to San Antonio as a major in the Air Force. 
He informed us that he was too old to go overseas. So

01:23.580 --> 01:28.905
he said to my mother, sell the house and bring the 
kids and come on down here. My older brother was in

01:28.925 --> 01:31.547
his first year at BMI. And at that time, we drove 
down on four black market tires that we had to get in

01:32.101 --> 01:39.409
order to make the trip. And the day we arrived, he 
got ordered overseas. And he left before we had any

01:43.833 --> 01:48.959
furniture in the house or really knew where we 
were. And they stayed here then the rest of their

01:49.899 --> 01:54.965
lives. I ended up going into the Navy after I 
graduated from high school in 1943. I finished one

02:01.565 --> 02:05.610
year of high school here in San Antonio. I spent 
three years in the Navy, got out. None of my family

02:08.433 --> 02:12.278
had ever gone to college. I guess I was one of the 
generation that, because of the GI Bill, had that

02:12.298 --> 02:19.526
opportunity. And I had no idea about colleges in 
Texas. My family, without any background in

02:25.373 --> 02:31.200
college-level education, weren't in any 
position to give me much advice. I happened to be

02:33.856 --> 02:44.147
running into a classmate, a high school classmate 
of mine, after I got out of Navy, and he said, where

02:33.856 --> 02:44.147
are you going to go to college? And I said, I haven't 
any idea. And he said, well, I'm going to go to A&M.

02:48.872 --> 02:49.533
You want to go there? And I said, where is it? And he 
said, well, I've got us a ride. At that time, there

02:54.979 --> 02:59.584
weren't many cars, and certainly in college, you 
didn't have cars. And he said, we've got an extra

03:00.070 --> 03:09.379
space you want to ride up with, so I packed a 
suitcase and joined three other guys and we drove

03:00.070 --> 03:09.379
up to A&M and that was my introduction to Texas A&M. 
And did you say you had finished high school? I did

03:13.583 --> 03:14.404
finish high school. Which high school? 
Alma-Hines. Alma-Hines. Alright, when you go to

03:18.108 --> 03:22.312
A&M, that's the fall of what year? Okay, there was 
one interlude in there and this bears on when I got

03:22.332 --> 03:27.597
there. My family was on a ranch up in Waco for the 
summer when I got out of the Navy. And when I was up,

03:32.303 --> 03:35.968
so I reported there after I got out of the Navy. I 
went to a, I think it was a semester or a quarter at

03:36.068 --> 03:43.198
Baylor in summer school and got some credits 
there. So I didn't come into A&M until the fall of

03:43.719 --> 03:47.404
47. 47. Yeah. You had never visited. Never, didn't 
know the place existed. Had you even applied? No.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.587
How did you get admitted? I had a high school 
diploma, and it's my understanding, at least from

04:00.328 --> 04:10.497
this perspective, all you had to do was show up on 
the campus with a high school diploma, and you

04:00.328 --> 04:10.497
could get in. You were better. Describe

04:11.438 --> 04:16.863
those first few days. How did you get located into a 
place to live and registration and so forth? Well,

04:22.848 --> 04:28.313
this friend of mine, and his name was John 
Drisdale, And John and I are still great friends.

04:32.562 --> 04:33.484
You were all freshmen? We were all freshmen. And he 
had been there before. He knew about the school. He

04:40.132 --> 04:41.414
had been there before. And I don't remember what 
circumstances. But we just showed up and

04:44.217 --> 04:47.782
registered. And they gave us a room. And he and I 
roomed together. Where was registration? Do you

04:52.928 --> 04:53.249
remember? I really don't remember. I think it may 
have been Sabisa Hall. It had to have been Sabisa

04:59.208 --> 05:11.069
Hall, because I was over, I was in, I did not go into 
the core initially, and so all of us, it was Sabisa

04:59.208 --> 05:11.069
Hall, I remember now. Do you remember what you took 
that first semester? I enrolled, my major was

05:14.616 --> 05:20.366
going to be business, and I just presumed it was 
just general business courses. I had It wasn't

05:22.934 --> 05:25.878
very well planned. I just decided business was a 
good thing to take, and I decided to take it. And I'm

05:30.024 --> 05:31.086
always glad I did. It was a good education. And 
where did you room that first time? I'm trying to

05:36.153 --> 05:38.456
think of the dorm number. It was there right as you 
go into Northgate on the right. Of course, at that

05:43.604 --> 05:48.431
time, that had always been core dormitories in 
there. The non-core people, the vets, were in

05:48.611 --> 05:52.637
there at that time, And I honestly don't remember 
the name of the dorm, it was down at the end of the

05:52.938 --> 05:57.883
little rectangle. Alright, and as an old veteran, 
you were how old? I must have been all of, let's see,

06:02.087 --> 06:07.512
20, maybe 19, 20. Yeah, I must have been about 20. 
And your Baylor courses made you basically,

06:13.378 --> 06:20.846
though, taking introductory courses, freshman 
courses that first year. That's right. Describe

06:22.807 --> 06:25.830
getting settled into the dormitory. What was in 
your room? What was the routine? Number one is for

06:29.214 --> 06:33.479
the newer people, they were not air conditioned. 
There were no telephones. It was a bare bones room.

06:37.223 --> 06:42.149
It had a double bunk, two tables, two chairs, and 
that was it. And my roommate and I, it was kind of

06:42.809 --> 06:45.853
hot. And together we scraped up enough money to go 
down to Montgomery Wards and finance electric

06:46.574 --> 06:52.240
fans which, as I remember, was at about $30. And 
later on, we decided we needed a radio, and so we

06:56.310 --> 07:03.040
went back down to Montgomery Wards and financed a 
radio. And as long as we were roommates, we kept

07:03.060 --> 07:10.891
that, and when we split, when I went into the Corps, 
we flipped a coin, and I got the fan, and he got the

07:03.060 --> 07:10.891
radio. It wasn't very fancy, but it served. The 
financing of this year, was it entirely GI Bill?

07:21.365 --> 07:22.547
Entirely GI Bill. Not long after I went to A&M, I 
started to work. I got a job down at WTOW. The

07:31.204 --> 07:33.647
college owned the station at that time. And the 
studios, if you can call them that, were on the top

07:33.667 --> 07:41.315
floor of the administration building. And so I 
worked jobs as a disc jockey down there. I remember

07:44.778 --> 07:51.825
I was interviewed and the fellow that interviewed 
me put me in front of a microphone and he said,

07:44.778 --> 07:51.825
imagine that you're announcing a golf match, and 
how would you broadcast a golf match? Well, I

07:58.437 --> 08:14.080
didn't play golf, but I'd seen enough of it that I 
stumbled my way through about five minutes of

07:58.437 --> 08:14.080
that, and he said, you're hired, and I made, I 
think, 50 cents an hour, and I had this jockey show

07:58.437 --> 08:14.080
for about a year and a half. How many hours per night 
or week?

08:19.548 --> 08:22.352
Not, maybe four hours a day. And then on the 
weekends, maybe more than that. What time did you

08:26.331 --> 08:28.353
play? I think it varied because we're all students 
and we just worked around our classes. And what

08:32.096 --> 08:33.537
kind of music did you play? Anything, but the most 
interesting music, I had a disc jockey show at

08:33.737 --> 08:46.688
1230, and my theme song was a Grandpa Jones record 
called Hear Rattler.

08:48.310 --> 08:52.153
And in that song, Grandpa Jones, about halfway 
through it, would call his dog and be, hey Rattler,

08:52.488 --> 08:58.275
hey Rattler. The troops loved this and of course 
that was before there was any air conditioning and

08:59.516 --> 09:11.350
all the windows were open in the dorms and the 
seniors would make the freshmen stick their heads

08:59.516 --> 09:11.350
out the window and call, hey Rattler, when my 
program came on. So it made my reputation at A&M, at

09:11.410 --> 09:15.094
least at that year. Did you have a distinctive name 
for your program? It was the Clark Monroe Show.

09:21.773 --> 09:22.535
Okay. My name got around the campus pretty quick. 
And the distance that WTAW could carry then, do you

09:27.382 --> 09:33.471
know? I don't think that much beyond Brazos 
County. I don't remember how many watts we had,

09:35.934 --> 09:43.866
maybe 5,000 watts, but nobody else would listen to 
us but A&M people anyway, and at that time there was

09:35.934 --> 09:43.866
no other station. KORA was not in existence at that 
time. That was the only other It was the only

09:47.855 --> 09:49.717
station in town. Really? Yeah. Did anybody at that 
point have an explanation of what the letters

09:51.940 --> 09:56.505
stood for? I don't ever remember anyone saying 
that. See, today, supposedly, they stand for

10:00.069 --> 10:04.814
Watch the Aggies Win. That's a later edition, I 
think. I don't remember that. We didn't win much

10:09.139 --> 10:11.061
back then, either. What kind of homework did you do 
to get your records and so forth ready? Oh, that was

10:17.484 --> 10:18.846
simple. I'd just walk in about 30 minutes ahead of 
time and pull records and go for 30 minutes if that

10:19.006 --> 10:25.396
was the time of my show. My show was ad lib. 
Everything else we had a format that they

10:29.703 --> 10:35.091
subscribed to and it was no problem. Now, Grandpa 
Jones is country music. Oh, yeah. But was it big

10:38.110 --> 10:40.693
band mixed in with country? Oh, yeah. Not on my 
show. My show was mostly country music. But we did

10:44.837 --> 10:49.002
some other things, you know, other times of the 
day. Now, had you done radio ever before? Never

10:51.305 --> 10:54.488
been in a radio station of my life.

10:57.411 --> 10:58.132
Back to your room. What were the furnishings in the 
room other than the bunk and the table? That was it.

11:03.708 --> 11:09.032
And how much gear did you take in terms of clothing 
in that first year? Oh, very little. I carried it

11:10.974 --> 11:12.615
all in two suitcases. And I'm sure I may have had one 
suit, thinking that this is right after the war.

11:20.182 --> 11:21.423
And there wasn't much of that. You still couldn't 
buy white shirts unless under the counter. And I

11:25.706 --> 11:28.048
didn't have enough money to buy more than one suit. 
So there was plenty of room. And room left over,

11:30.110 --> 11:33.613
yeah. This was a veteran's dorm. Yeah, 
everything, at that time, everybody was in the

11:36.514 --> 11:40.538
corps unless you were a veteran. So this is what we 
called a non-vet, I mean, a non-corps. About how

11:44.161 --> 11:52.429
many of you, as far as you can recall, about what was 
the percentage of non-corps, of the vets? Gosh,

11:54.431 --> 12:01.457
I'm sure I knew that at one time, but I would say in 
47, probably...

12:03.530 --> 12:06.814
The core was still, I think, in the majority. And 
I'm thinking now, probably left out of that

12:07.294 --> 12:12.561
calculation, the married students. Because a lot 
of vets were married and lived off campus. But the

12:16.625 --> 12:18.828
core was the big bulk. The core was A&M. Describe a 
day of routine for you that first year. What time

12:25.896 --> 12:27.438
did you get up? What did you do where? Where did you?

12:33.061 --> 12:36.645
I remember we walked a little far. The classrooms 
were down below where the power plant is now. They

12:42.992 --> 12:44.915
were all temporary buildings. Wooden army 
barracks type of buildings.

12:51.522 --> 12:55.066
I'd usually get up about maybe seven o'clock. I ate 
sabisa. I always ate sabisa because I didn't have

12:57.409 --> 13:00.773
money left to eat anywhere else. And there wasn't 
much other places to eat anyway. And my classes

13:06.761 --> 13:09.366
were all down south to power plant. So I went down 
there, but then of course when I was working at

13:09.746 --> 13:18.220
WTOG, I had to walk down to the administration 
building. Now, are you talking about the system

13:18.240 --> 13:19.983
administration? System administration. The one 
east, not the old academic. Not the old academic

13:22.527 --> 13:25.512
building, no. That was my pattern pretty much. 
Now, I did have some classes like English and

13:27.816 --> 13:34.986
liberal arts classes for up in the academic 
building. I don't recall having a science class.

13:36.749 --> 13:41.856
So I think primarily I was in the old barracks down 
south of the power plant and academic building.

13:41.876 --> 13:42.477
That was it. Of course, there was no student 
center. All right. And you walked back to eat

13:44.620 --> 13:46.763
lunch. I walked back to eat lunch. Did you have any 
free time? Any unscheduled time? Not really. I

13:53.284 --> 13:55.968
took a pretty good load all the time. I think I took 
at least 18 hours, and then of course working down

13:56.128 --> 14:01.154
in WTOW took up the rest of my time. What did you all 
do in the evenings after supper? I'd like to say

14:04.698 --> 14:12.228
that we studied, and I'm sure we did some, but I 
don't recall having been overburdened with study

14:04.698 --> 14:12.228
either.

14:14.871 --> 14:18.195
There really wasn't much to do there at that time. 
How were you veterans treated by the

14:18.496 --> 14:23.723
non-veterans, younger veterans? There never 
were any problems.

14:28.128 --> 14:36.058
Of course, you really can break down into the 
married veterans, the non-married veterans, and

14:28.128 --> 14:36.058
then the Corps. The Corps was, you know, they were 
physically separated from us, but there was never

14:36.098 --> 14:44.048
any problem at all. They got along well, and a 
number of guys The veterans moved on over to the

14:48.112 --> 14:53.499
Corps, which is what I did in my junior year. Now, 
you all left your doors open, I presume. Oh, yeah.

14:55.902 --> 14:56.242
Because... I didn't have, I don't think I had a key. 
I maybe did, but I don't remember. And nothing was

15:00.287 --> 15:01.548
ever stolen. No. And you left your windows open 
except when it rained. Yes. Very few people had

15:07.135 --> 15:08.557
covers. A couple of, you know, some of the veterans 
had covers. I was not one of them. But if you wanted

15:13.283 --> 15:17.528
to go into town, into Bryan, you know, you could 
find somebody to... to ride with. But we

15:19.560 --> 15:21.844
hitchhiked back and forth to Bryan too. There 
wasn't much in Bryan, that was the only movie.

15:24.629 --> 15:26.452
Other than that, there was the campus theater too. 
But we'd want to go in town. And your roommate

15:30.098 --> 15:32.782
became a close friend. Did you make any other 
important lasting friendships that first year?

15:37.673 --> 15:45.261
Yeah, none that I've kept up with since then, but in 
Grizzdale I have. We used to double date a lot. We

15:47.143 --> 15:53.210
used to come down to San Antonio and we had a couple 
of girlfriends down there.

15:53.230 --> 16:00.638
But I really didn't make a lot of friends like that 
that stayed with me until I moved over into the

15:53.230 --> 16:00.638
Corps. During that first semester, what were the 
events or what other circumstances that made you

16:06.833 --> 16:13.180
think that you had made a good choice, that this is a 
place that you liked? Uh, I'll tell you, the thing

16:13.200 --> 16:24.432
probably that made me like Indian at that time was I 
had, coming out of the Navy, I'd been on board a

16:13.200 --> 16:24.432
cruiser. I was in a group, a division on a cruiser. 
There were 16 of us that lived in literally almost a

16:29.417 --> 16:35.524
closet, you know, stacked more than five bucks 
high. and you get used to being with a lot of people

16:35.690 --> 16:47.401
in close contact and there's a certain 
camaraderie that stems from that and I kind of

16:35.690 --> 16:47.401
sense that same sort of thing. When I first got out 
of the Navy I missed that because I was in town and I

16:47.882 --> 17:04.718
didn't know anybody and I almost re-enlisted and 
went back to the Navy but fortunately I didn't but I

16:47.882 --> 17:04.718
think that camaraderie carried over and I always 
appreciated that. Do you remember any of the A&M

17:06.438 --> 17:11.524
extracurricular events that fall? I'm not sure if 
it was this fall, but it probably was. Number one,

17:16.910 --> 17:25.320
there were not much structured extracurricular 
activity except athletics. You know, you had the

17:25.520 --> 17:29.965
dorms and the core units and so forth. That was 
about it. But you had Yale practice. Oh, yeah, we

17:32.534 --> 17:33.996
did have Yale practice. The one that stands out in 
my mind was one that WTAW sponsored together, I

17:34.977 --> 17:49.616
think with the battalion, but I think it was mostly 
WTAW, that we brought Grandpa Jones down for a

17:34.977 --> 17:49.616
concert. And the only place to have it that we could 
get into was what was known as the Assembly Hall.

17:56.886 --> 17:57.807
And it was... Oh, not too far from the grill field. 
There was a wooden building, exposed rafters,

18:02.987 --> 18:09.196
hot. And old Grandpa Jones came down. This was in 
the summer when it was very hot. And he was really a

18:13.662 --> 18:17.288
young man, but he dressed up like he was an older 
man. He had a white mustache glued on, you know, on

18:17.328 --> 18:20.993
the hat. And the troops loved him. We packed and 
sent him home. and it got so hot that old Grandma

18:26.120 --> 18:31.585
jumped the bus dash bomb. But that was, and he sang 
Hear Rattler, I guess, five times, you know. And

18:37.871 --> 18:40.734
that was a fun thing. That was a big 
extracurricular activity. You and your new

18:44.257 --> 18:52.205
student buddies, what about the first football 
games and Yale practices and things like that? Oh,

18:52.305 --> 18:52.925
we loved them. Yeah, we, you know, We kind of got 
caught up in the way the Corps did it. We went to

19:00.387 --> 19:02.069
everything. Again, there were no girls there, 
which makes a big difference. There was a lot of

19:05.713 --> 19:08.616
beer drinking and that type of thing. All off 
campus, of course. The

19:11.659 --> 19:18.586
only activities were centered around the Corps. 
We just fit in right without any problem with that.

19:22.803 --> 19:25.566
Do you remember where y'all practices were held? 
On the steps of Goodwin Hall. Goodwin or YMCA? I

19:33.273 --> 19:34.194
think it was Goodwin. Goodwin? Yeah, because we 
spilled out on the parade ground. Yeah, it was

19:37.237 --> 19:39.920
Goodwin Hall. And they weren't on held at 
midnight, were they? I don't recall. Not in my

19:45.245 --> 19:48.028
first year or two. That's what I thought. But yeah, 
toward the latter year, because I... After I

19:53.532 --> 19:56.156
worked on W-Town, I went to work on the battalion. 
And that was when I got into the Corps. And the

20:02.005 --> 20:11.961
reason I respond to the midnight yell practice 
thing is because there's been a midnight yell

20:02.005 --> 20:11.961
practice up at Fort Worth or Dallas, and it got 
pretty rough. And some guys got hurt. So on the

20:15.503 --> 20:27.821
battalion, we occasionally launched off into an 
ill-thought crusade, and we decided that

20:15.503 --> 20:27.821
midnight yell practice off campus wasn't a good 
thing to do, and we editorialized against it. That

20:29.143 --> 20:31.727
was not a wise thing to do. I don't know where 
they've drowned out people now, but at that time,

20:31.747 --> 20:45.207
if you upset somebody, they would make 
arrangements to come into your room in the middle

20:31.747 --> 20:45.207
of the night and dump a tub full of water on you. And 
as a battalion rider, I was at odds with people

20:45.676 --> 20:54.630
occasionally, and I used to get drowned out pretty 
regularly. My senior year, I roomed with a corps

20:55.872 --> 21:01.041
commander, and he wouldn't sleep on the lower 
bunk. I had to sleep on the lower bunk. So, back to

21:03.104 --> 21:10.536
your question, we did have midnight yell 
practice, and after we editorialized against it,

21:10.988 --> 21:12.430
And I got drowned out several times. We stopped 
editorializing against me in that Yale practice.

21:17.518 --> 21:21.124
Describe going to an Aggie football game, that 
first year or so. You know, I don't recall, other

21:22.826 --> 21:30.338
than maybe going up to Waco, going to football 
games off campus. No, on campus. Oh, on campus. Oh,

21:32.100 --> 21:33.082
okay. Oh, it was, you know, I don't think it's 
changed except in numbers. I don't think it's

21:36.086 --> 21:37.148
changed at all. It was a big event. Did you veterans 
stand up? Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. But the interesting

21:43.948 --> 21:48.954
thing, at that time, there wasn't an athletic 
dormitory. The athletes lived in the units. I

21:51.897 --> 21:57.262
don't know where they go to classes these days, but 
they went to classes then. You rub shoulders with

21:57.823 --> 22:04.890
all the guys on the team constantly.

22:06.052 --> 22:11.479
Who were the, were there any celebrity stars when 
you got there? Not that I remember. Because they

22:14.644 --> 22:18.929
were all, there were a number of veterans in that 
group, too. Yeah. I don't, you know, I can't call

22:20.211 --> 22:27.000
the name of somebody in those early days who was a 
big star. We really didn't have very good teams, to

22:27.020 --> 22:30.745
tell the truth. I do remember going to, I believe I 
did make a game in Austin, but... you know, didn't

22:36.848 --> 22:40.531
have much money, so it was kind of hard to travel. I 
remember one time we did, now this is after I got in

22:40.972 --> 22:55.484
the Corps, we went to a game up in Dallas, and five of 
us crowded into a Jeep with a canvas top on it. You

22:55.504 --> 22:58.387
know, put five people in a Jeep, it isn't easy. And 
that was kind of how we got around, but that was

22:59.047 --> 23:01.970
better than hitchhiking. During that first year, 
who did you turn to for advice about Anything?

23:10.512 --> 23:13.396
I don't really recall turning to anybody for 
advice. You know, we, when I think of the veterans,

23:14.318 --> 23:22.089
had kind of learned to live on our own. Did you all 
think of yourselves as comparatively mature?

23:26.515 --> 23:28.819
Older, I don't know about mature, but older. About 
the only person that I went to for anything was,

23:29.419 --> 23:36.049
there was a His name will come to me. A student loan 
fund, McQuillan, E.E. McQuillan ran a student

23:42.645 --> 23:44.568
loan fund. And you could walk into E.E. and, oh, it 
was Mr. McQuillan, and you could borrow $10 on your

23:46.570 --> 23:51.778
signature. And no interest. All you had to do was 
agree to pay it back. And almost everybody I knew

23:55.743 --> 24:00.250
was always in hock to Mr. McQuillan. But he told me 
one time, he said, I never lost any money. So he

24:03.634 --> 24:06.238
would be the person I would go to when I needed $10. 
All right. When you were registering, say, for the

24:08.729 --> 24:18.642
second or third or fourth semesters, was there 
someone you turned to for advice on what courses to

24:08.729 --> 24:18.642
take or not to take? No. We were allowed to pick our 
own courses. They said, you have to have these

24:20.945 --> 24:23.989
before you graduate. And we just went and took 
them. There was no counseling in that sense. I'm

24:28.375 --> 24:32.260
talking about in the business courses. Were there 
some faculty members whose courses you had who

24:32.611 --> 24:40.761
became important to you in terms of what you 
learned? I'm not talking about necessarily the

24:41.422 --> 24:46.869
facts, but what they really taught you? One man, 
and at this minute I can't call his name, stood out

24:48.952 --> 24:57.182
head and shoulders above everybody else, and he 
taught geography. And I don't know why. Skip's

24:58.124 --> 24:59.265
lesson? Skipper's lesson? No, no. Okay. I know who 
he is, but he was not my father. And I don't know that

25:06.440 --> 25:08.742
he was there that long. And I don't know why I was 
taking geography. But he made geography come

25:11.064 --> 25:13.567
alive. And we all liked it. I think the veterans 
were more critical of the professors than the

25:17.010 --> 25:27.681
non-vets. And you could see that. And if there was a 
phoneme, there were some phonemes. We spotted

25:34.441 --> 25:35.503
them pretty quick. I remember I had an advertising 
prof that I don't think could find the front door.

25:40.211 --> 25:44.018
A&M wouldn't tolerate someone like that today. 
But you have to think that all of a sudden overnight

25:44.058 --> 25:49.547
A&M doubled or more. in its student population, 
and I don't know where they got the crops to come in

25:50.236 --> 25:55.344
from. But there were some good ones, but there were 
some . What about the size of classes? Size of

26:01.493 --> 26:05.579
classes were pretty large, at least it seemed to me 
they were large. In the early years, they'd fill a

26:06.380 --> 26:10.746
room. Are you talking about 30, or are you talking 
about 300? No, 50, 60, but they couldn't get any

26:14.732 --> 26:17.937
more than that in a room. And in the summertime, 
when it's not in a condition And it's a wooden

26:20.307 --> 26:21.569
building. You didn't want any more than that in the 
room anyway. But we didn't know anybody. You know,

26:25.975 --> 26:28.698
it had always been us. And academically, how were 
those first semesters for you? I didn't have much

26:32.764 --> 26:34.907
problem.

26:36.689 --> 26:45.942
Again, I think I had been exposed to some things, 
you know, just in living through three years in the

26:36.689 --> 26:45.942
Navy, that made things easier for me. Did anybody 
ever attempt to... warn you people like they did

26:48.860 --> 26:55.871
the fish, look to your left, look to your right, 
only one of you will still be here two years from

26:48.860 --> 26:55.871
now? No, the veterans, they didn't do that to us. We 
were on our own, and we could do pretty much what we

26:58.494 --> 27:01.138
wanted to do. And there were no special advisors 
just for y'all? If there were, I never met one.

27:11.013 --> 27:18.124
Since the MSC wasn't there yet, where did y'all go 
for a soft drink, for an ice cream cone? There were,

27:18.728 --> 27:28.379
I'm going to dig back in memory now, there were 
several, I'll call them stands, or almost tiny

27:18.728 --> 27:28.379
cafes around. There was one up in the core area, was 
it Casey's? And there were maybe two others around

27:32.504 --> 27:41.954
campus that you could go to, and they served 
hamburgers and hot dogs and coffee and stuff like

27:32.504 --> 27:41.954
that. And you just walked to them, and they were 
just typical little cafes. And wasn't there one in

27:45.719 --> 27:47.841
the Y? I don't remember one in Hawaii, but there was 
the Aggieland, I believe it was Aggieland Inn,

27:49.103 --> 27:59.999
which was not too far from Sevesa, across the 
street, I believe. And you could get a nice meal in

28:00.019 --> 28:02.963
there. It wasn't very large, and since none of us 
had any money, we didn't go in there very often. But

28:09.212 --> 28:12.877
it was a place you could take your parents when they 
came up. Although my parents never came down to

28:13.278 --> 28:16.342
campus, I don't think. I don't think they ever sat 
down again. My mother. How often did, the first

28:18.972 --> 28:23.101
year or so, how often did you come home?

28:26.128 --> 28:31.480
Maybe two or three times, hitchhike, get in the 
Aggieland. Now, you didn't have a uniform to wear.

28:34.186 --> 28:34.407
No. That first year. Was it easier for the guys in 
uniform to get a ride than it was for the rest of you?

28:42.253 --> 28:46.519
No, because in the A line, you just walked up and you 
put your bag down. There were some guys from the

28:46.599 --> 28:49.963
Corps there and some nonvets. And the people who 
would stop, they didn't care. They knew who you

28:51.806 --> 28:53.328
were. What route did you take going back and forth? 
Highway 21. Really? Yeah, Highway 21. Normally,

29:00.657 --> 29:04.002
how much time did you expect it to take? Your 
experience led you to believe it. To get a ride? No,

29:09.837 --> 29:11.319
no, no, from there to here. Oh gosh, I don't 
remember. Yeah, maybe three or four hours. So not

29:17.126 --> 29:18.267
much longer than that? No, it's not much longer. 
You get picked up quickly. I mean, unless you were

29:20.430 --> 29:22.212
traveling at an off time. But I'd go out and hit the 
Aggie line in San Antonio and get to A&M by the same

29:22.993 --> 29:28.099
amount of time as I do now. Where in San Antonio was 
the best place for an Aggie to get a ride? It was at

29:31.804 --> 29:32.885
Austin Highway. Austin Highway off of Broadway. 
That's always been it. Used to be. That why. Every

29:42.039 --> 29:44.622
time you knew where it was. And if you didn't, 
someone would tell you. Share some of the

29:47.204 --> 29:51.148
interesting anecdotes you remember from Aggie 
hitchhiking. Anytime in your days. I always had

29:53.851 --> 29:55.012
pretty good luck. I did get with a guy one time that 
had been drinking and drove too fast. And I got out.

30:03.641 --> 30:04.441
I forget where I got out. Round Rock somewhere. Not 
Round Rock. Bastrop. But, you know, most of the

30:08.204 --> 30:11.468
guys would pick you up. They might be Aggies, or 
there were parents taking Aggies by them. So I

30:15.713 --> 30:18.197
never had any unusual experiences. Never worried 
about it. Did anybody buy you something to eat? I

30:22.862 --> 30:24.024
don't remember that, no. We always stopped at 
Bastrop. And did they ever offer you a drink? Never

30:29.731 --> 30:32.555
was offered a drink, no. Any negative 
experiences? None whatsoever. It was so routine.

30:37.516 --> 30:39.959
Nobody thought anything about it. That's what you 
said is almost exactly what everybody else has

30:39.979 --> 30:43.364
said. And you didn't hold up a sign. No. They knew 
you were there. Let's see. Did you veterans, did

30:52.176 --> 30:56.763
they have a nickname for y'all or anything? No, we 
were just, I think, non-regs. I think you call us

30:59.807 --> 31:00.648
non-regs. You were all, even though you were a 
veteran. Yeah.

31:05.976 --> 31:07.017
What did you wear to class? That's a funny question 
to ask because I don't remember, but I'm sure it

31:07.604 --> 31:16.112
wasn't much.
