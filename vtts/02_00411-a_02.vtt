WEBVTT

00:01.415 --> 00:21.837
and

00:01.415 --> 00:21.837
i'll go ahead and well before i go to your children 
i'd like to ask a little bit more about these lands

00:01.415 --> 00:21.837
you you say that that after a while the people who 
were working them just never Oh, said anything

00:22.390 --> 00:24.413
from them. That's right. And your aunts and uncles 
then began to try to get them back? Oh, yes. My aunt,

00:29.660 --> 00:33.145
,, tried to get rid of us. Well, I think she took too 
long. That's what I understand. They probably

00:39.534 --> 00:42.758
thought, well, we'll do it Sunday. But they got to a 
point that time passed, and they never did

00:44.240 --> 00:51.250
anything about it until it was too late. Like, for 
instance, the people that took over the lands got

00:51.685 --> 01:01.755
old, and their sons took over. So some of these 
people had already died, the first people that

01:02.956 --> 01:09.623
kept them. So these new people, they wouldn't 
recognize anybody, because they'd probably say,

01:10.784 --> 01:21.675
well, we've been here so long, and 90% is the 
precision of the law, so it's ours. They probably

01:21.993 --> 01:24.599
got papers on it too, you know. That's why she never 
could do anything about it. But I think they waited

01:27.625 --> 01:29.850
too long to do anything about it. So they didn't 
really start trying to do anything until about

01:29.870 --> 01:35.502
1931, which is when these papers were. Yes, that's 
when my father was going to take charge of it. And

01:39.543 --> 01:41.205
try to get the right back for him. That's right. And 
then from then on, several years passed when he

01:41.906 --> 01:52.581
tried it again, when Santa Clarita tried it, and it 
was already too late. Well, you can see in this

01:52.601 --> 02:01.013
part, one of the, one, Simon Parra, was, was saying 
that it would be all right for him. He was one of the,

02:01.073 --> 02:03.576
one that stayed with the land. He was taking care of 
it. Simone. Parra. No, he was a neighbor of my

02:07.655 --> 02:10.399
father or something. He had the same, was he a 
cousin? Parra, no. No, because it's the same. No,

02:17.429 --> 02:18.050
Porras. Oh, Porras. I see. Parra is a different 
name. Parra is a different name. All right. And so

02:23.017 --> 02:27.704
this document says, in effect, could you just sort 
of read that in English? Roughly. Say more or less

02:30.528 --> 02:32.371
what it says in English. This man, Simone Parra, 
was going to send my aunts what they can and he was

02:34.150 --> 02:54.303
going to take care of the ranches and tell them once 
in a while that he was going to send money and he was

02:34.150 --> 02:54.303
going to pay the Texas over there and he was in 
charge. That's why this document was made so they

02:54.343 --> 03:00.833
agreed for him to stay over there so he could send 
something. But as the year passed by, they forgot

03:01.117 --> 03:06.730
all about it and they knew something about 
anything. And that's why this was the last thing

03:06.750 --> 03:10.839
they did. He agreed to Some money to them. So in 
1931, he actually, this man, Simon Bada, actually

03:16.132 --> 03:27.224
agreed that he was renting and that he would send 
them some money. So he accepted their ownership in

03:27.244 --> 03:29.567
that year. In that year. But then nothing ever came 
up. Well, my aunt cried hard afterwards, too. It

03:36.795 --> 03:39.898
was in 1945.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.663
No, later than that. Later than that. Here, you can 
see a map with more... Is that the sketch?

03:49.176 --> 03:53.344
Something about kilometers and the ranches of 
Fernando Leal. The ones that stayed on those parts

03:53.404 --> 03:55.909
of the ranches. Alvarez, Ornones, Juarez, Miguel 
Barra, Fernando Zambrano. See? So these are

04:05.306 --> 04:07.113
people who stayed on the land. And eventually, 
they and their heirs took it over. Oh, yes, they

04:10.024 --> 04:11.369
did. Now, did they all stay in Mexico? Or did any of 
them come to the States? I think they all stayed

04:14.827 --> 04:16.989
over there in Mexico. They did. I believe none of 
those, I don't think any of those people actually

04:18.090 --> 04:30.181
lived, no one lived very long, or after your Tia 
Leta was trying to get the land back, none of them

04:18.090 --> 04:30.181
were living. No, I think they were all. Yeah, only 
their sons, their heirs were. And their heirs

04:35.486 --> 04:38.689
would never get them up. So I don't know. She had a 
lot of things, a lot of people, and I think they're

04:41.932 --> 04:44.715
all were over there. Here's another one, 1944.

04:58.772 --> 05:09.249
Now

04:58.772 --> 05:09.249
they even tried to say that they were the owners of 
the land, see? Instead of my hands. Because Estos

05:12.151 --> 05:22.749
Señores Se Basan, they were talking about the 
titulos, que they already expired from my aunt, so

05:12.151 --> 05:22.749
she didn't have contra la ley. They have a law in 
Mexico, I don't understand very clearly, but I

05:22.789 --> 05:30.902
think that if a piece of land is abandoned, And 
after so many years, nobody lays claim to them.

05:35.709 --> 05:40.556
That person, any person, can go and they call it 
denunciar. I don't know what that word would mean

05:40.576 --> 05:42.920
in English. To denounce. Denounce or something 
like that. That's right. And they in turn, if it's

05:47.346 --> 05:54.477
publicized in papers or someone, if nobody turns 
up, Claiming the land, now they could give title to

05:54.457 --> 05:57.821
it. And that it would be a clear title. And after 
years, if somebody went, well, you're sitting on

05:59.583 --> 06:04.149
my land. Sorry, you didn't claim the knowledge. 
When there was time. Yeah, when there was time. I

06:10.296 --> 06:11.598
think actually that's what they did. After so many 
years that nobody went to lay claim to them, they

06:12.238 --> 06:19.727
took over. And this is what my father used to do. 
This was his mines. This is

06:23.887 --> 06:41.064
his map that he actually made when he was going down 
into the mines in 1920.

06:41.625 --> 06:48.612
Did you ever find out why he didn't move back to 
Mexico since he was doing so much of his work in

06:41.625 --> 06:48.612
Mexico? Well, he was doing all right here. I don't 
see why he would have to go over there. Maybe he

06:54.607 --> 06:56.510
liked it. He liked it. I know he did. He did. Did he 
speak both English and Spanish? Well, he used to

07:04.543 --> 07:09.591
read a lot of English, but he couldn't speak 
English. But he could write it and understand

07:09.611 --> 07:13.738
Spanish and Latin. Now, you learned to read and 
write in Spanish. Where did you learn to read and

07:17.238 --> 07:19.261
write in Spanish? Here. Here at El Paso? Well, I 
went over there to Jesus and Mary Academy. They

07:24.048 --> 07:25.230
taught more Spanish than you. They did, more 
Spanish than me. Well, this was a private school

07:26.732 --> 07:29.116
that you went to. So you were actually educated in 
both languages. Oh, yes. How long did you go to

07:33.903 --> 07:35.305
school? 12 years. You went through high school. 
Yes, all my grades over there. What did you do after

07:41.792 --> 07:43.935
you got out of school? I worked. You worked? Where 
did you work? Well, I started working over here at

07:47.039 --> 07:50.685
the, what was it? It was a little store in Norbury. 
Glass of Pearl? Glass of Pearl Bookie. Glass of

07:56.213 --> 07:57.054
Pearl Shop. And then I got married, and then he 
wouldn't let me go to work. Oh, here I am. I'm home.

08:04.816 --> 08:07.180
No, she insisted. I insisted. You insisted? Yeah. 
Every year a kid, how could I go to work? So, no. No, I

08:12.930 --> 08:17.879
like staying home with all my kids. All right. Now, 
we sort of cut off your story in the middle and

08:19.141 --> 08:25.553
changed over. So, what... Oh, I know. Okay, your 
father, when we stopped, your father had gone back

08:30.341 --> 08:37.278
to Mexico, and this was in 19... Is he 50? Well, he 
went back to Mexico. Actually, he went back to

08:40.325 --> 08:43.172
Mexico when I was 14 years old. That would be back 
in, what would it be, 19... Well, what year were you

08:48.657 --> 08:52.741
born? Well,

08:52.861 --> 09:01.930
what year were you born? 1918. Oh, that's right. 
You'd be in the 30s. You'd be about 1932. Had he ever

09:10.558 --> 09:15.323
become an American citizen? No. My mother did. My 
mother did, because she always loved the United

09:17.435 --> 09:20.319
States. I don't know why, but she was very happy 
here. In fact, she said to Mexico, I'll never go.

09:29.331 --> 09:32.776
She went to visit your aunt in Chihuahua. She 
didn't visit Mexico, but that's all she did. In

09:35.860 --> 09:36.821
Mexico City. But to live, she never lived in 
Mexico. No, she liked it. Now, her family, her

09:40.497 --> 09:43.500
sisters and brothers stayed in Mexico. Yes, they 
did. In fact, they still live in Chihuahua. She's

09:47.083 --> 09:50.206
got a brother and her sister. They're pretty old 
now, a couple of ages. And they raised their

09:55.552 --> 09:57.574
children in Mexico. What did their children do? 
Actually, I haven't kept in touch with them. I

10:05.161 --> 10:08.344
don't know, but I used to go on vacations. 
Chihuahua. Somehow,

10:10.750 --> 10:19.341
they always worked in bars, I think, or something 
like that.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.086
They would travel around the country. What they 
did, I don't know. I really don't know. I don't

10:27.731 --> 10:34.479
think anybody... Well, Francisco, I think he 
worked for the government. The government of

10:34.639 --> 10:35.800
Mexico. Yeah, he worked for the government. In 
fact, he's sort of a sheriff or what do you call it? A

10:44.596 --> 10:48.621
police official in some little town south of 
Chihuahua. And he's, what kin is he to you? He's my

10:52.145 --> 10:52.866
cousin. He's your cousin on your mother's side. On 
my mother's side, yes. And he's about the only one

10:59.754 --> 11:02.197
that has a steady job. He's had a steady job here, I 
can remember. But the other ones have a little

11:05.120 --> 11:07.423
store. Who was it?

11:11.895 --> 11:12.356
Luis. Well, he had a bar. A restaurant? No, 
Enrique. Enrique, Enrique. Oh, he was a bar owner

11:21.494 --> 11:23.358
of a restaurant. Something like that. Maybe I'd 
better draw them down, too. Let's see, your

11:26.424 --> 11:27.746
mother's name was? Nicolasa. Nicolasa.

11:33.205 --> 11:36.911
And she was from Zacatecas, Zacatecas. And then 
how many brothers and sisters did she have? Well,

11:42.680 --> 11:46.185
it's Aurelio and Rosa. Those are sisters? Brother 
and sister. OK, Aurelio. Aurelio's a brother, and

11:50.872 --> 11:53.857
Rosa's her sister. And that was it. That was all.

11:59.145 --> 12:01.288
And they both married. And Aurelio had some 
children. Oh, he's got about 12 kids, I think. Now,

12:09.934 --> 12:11.057
where did they live? Where did Aurelio live? They 
came to Chihuahua. When they came to Chihuahua,

12:14.122 --> 12:16.006
they all stayed at Chihuahua. Oh, all of your 
mother's family came to Chihuahua together?

12:18.871 --> 12:25.082
Yeah, after the capture of Zacatecas, they left 
Zacatecas because it was... Well, they were

12:25.923 --> 12:29.408
peaceful people and they didn't like, uh... Uh... 
So they were, you know, the lot they were going

12:30.790 --> 12:35.517
through in Zacatecas. And the way that my mother 
told me... You see, my grandmother's sister, my

12:36.839 --> 12:44.411
grandmother's sister was in Chihuahua. Mm-hmm. 
And they were riding to each other. And then my

12:48.256 --> 12:52.723
mother, my grandmother's sister... sent for her, 
she says, why don't you come over and see if you like

12:53.851 --> 12:59.557
this thing, Chihuahua. And you can bring the 
family if you like it. Well, what was your

13:02.180 --> 13:03.481
grandmother's name? Jesus. Jesus or Jesusa? 
Jesus. Well, Jesus, Jesusita, or Jesusa. And your

13:14.573 --> 13:17.816
grandfather's name on your mother's side was? 
Guadalupe. Guadalupe. Hasso. Hasso.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.856
H-A-S-S-O? J-A-S-S-O. J-A-S-S-O. Do you know 
what he did in Zacatecas before he had to leave?

13:38.706 --> 13:40.068
Well, he had a... He was a blacksmith by trade. He 
had a shop there, a blacksmith's shop. He was doing

13:46.397 --> 13:50.542
very well, but like I say, they didn't like the 
way... I mean, they were... The life they were

13:51.784 --> 13:57.432
going through because of the soldiers and all 
that, you know, barring the girls and all that.

13:57.612 --> 13:58.553
This was your... This is the blacksmith. All 
right. This is the blacksmith, the blacksmith

14:00.355 --> 14:02.958
Guadalupe. And he was part Indian. And his wife was 
Espanol. And she was from a Zacatecas family too.

14:11.708 --> 14:15.552
And then he was a blacksmith and doing very well in 
Zacatecas. And oh, you said your mother was listed

14:16.173 --> 14:20.217
in the birth records as a mestiza. So they were 
still listing people that way. Yeah, they were

14:22.059 --> 14:23.601
listing people that way. They don't do that 
anymore. No, they don't. I don't do that. They

14:25.844 --> 14:27.966
don't do that anymore. And

14:28.081 --> 14:36.193
so their children were already fairly 
well-grown. Yes. Yes, they were well-grown. In

14:38.476 --> 14:42.202
fact, my uncle, he was learning the trade. Your 
uncle? Yes, Aurelio. Aurelio was learning to be a

14:45.267 --> 14:46.969
blacksmith. Blacksmith, yes.

14:51.195 --> 14:56.383
In fact, I think that's the work he did all his life. 
Oh, thank you. When he came to Chihuahua, he got a

14:59.767 --> 15:03.694
job with a railroad. He worked for the railroad. 
Oh, that's good. Start ducking it.

15:17.103 --> 15:22.472
I was just reading about the taking of Zacatecas 
and apparently it was really terrible. It was. The

15:23.634 --> 15:33.970
way my mother tells me that the federal forces in 
Zacatecas had told the people that Dictate could

15:23.634 --> 15:33.970
never be captured. It could never be captured. It 
was well fortified. And my mother tells me that

15:37.957 --> 15:42.604
about 10 o'clock in the morning He's starting to 
hear the people at the IVN and IVN, and here they

15:44.575 --> 15:48.901
come, see. And just the advance troops of Villa 
were starting to attack. And my mother-in-law

15:54.208 --> 16:12.152
said, first it was just a cannon roar, then machine 
gun, and then in about an hour or so, he said, you can

15:54.208 --> 16:12.152
distinguish a bullet from a cannon, just like a... 
a pot of boiling frijoles, you know, just a boiling

16:12.554 --> 16:16.718
kettle. That's the way it did here, you know, and 
then pretty soon all the government forces were

16:16.738 --> 16:22.723
falling back. They were being defeated, you know, 
and the VF forces were breaking through. And she

16:27.488 --> 16:41.481
remembers that the poor federal soldiers were 
shedding their uniforms and asking the people for

16:27.488 --> 16:41.481
clothes, you know, because they knew that they 
were going to get killed, you know, and they got

16:27.488 --> 16:41.481
captured. And so, he said it didn't take too long 
before the force of it was running through the

16:41.883 --> 16:50.881
streets, yelling and shooting and everything. 
And it was just a terrible thing. How old was she at

16:53.426 --> 16:54.849
that time? I don't really know, but I think she was 
in her 20s. I think she was.

17:05.643 --> 17:07.505
Did she say what her family did? Did they lock up 
their house or what? Yeah, they stayed indoors for

17:09.087 --> 17:12.290
I don't know how many days. And they didn't stay too 
long in Zacatecas when my grandmother's aunt

17:13.071 --> 17:22.001
wrote her and told her. She couldn't stand it 
anymore, but come to Chihuahua and see how they

17:22.021 --> 17:25.986
liked it. They could stay there. And they went to my 
grandmother's... and stayed there for a while,

17:32.356 --> 17:34.899
and they found a home. They found a place to live.

17:38.923 --> 17:46.270
My aunt, she was younger, a lot younger than my 
mother. I think she was, oh, about 10 or 15 years

17:46.310 --> 17:50.975
younger. And

17:51.035 --> 18:01.266
she started working in a clothes factory, and then 
my mother started working at the How had your aunt

18:01.617 --> 18:09.645
happened to go to Chihuahua in the first place? My 
grandmother's aunt? My grandmother's aunt? I

18:15.150 --> 18:15.671
don't know. I really don't know how she come to be in 
Chihuahua at that time. But anyway, she was there,

18:21.997 --> 18:25.040
and your parents went and joined her. And were your 
great-grandparents still alive at that time? No,

18:30.389 --> 18:44.550
I

18:30.389 --> 18:44.550
don't

18:30.389 --> 18:44.550
remember.

18:44.711 --> 18:47.855
I don't think so. The only, on my great 
grandparent's side that I got to know because she

18:49.017 --> 18:55.006
was very old. Your abuelita. No, no. Sister to my 
great-grandmother. In other words, my

19:01.957 --> 19:07.042
grandmother, my grandmother's sister.

19:12.207 --> 19:14.709
She was an aunt to my grandmother. An aunt to your, 
yeah. Yeah, she was real old. Yeah, she was big. I

19:19.754 --> 19:26.721
remember the first time we went there in 1929, 
1930, I saw her. And where did you visit her? In

19:29.414 --> 19:30.175
Chihuahua City. In Chihuahua City. Well, maybe 
your mother's family was from Chihuahua

19:32.058 --> 19:37.165
originally, before she married your father. No, 
she was from Zacatecas. No, she was from

19:38.667 --> 19:41.111
Zacatecas. From Zacatecas, your mother. I'll 
tell you why, because my father, I remember he used

19:44.696 --> 19:52.708
to kill my mother, because the people from 
Zacatecas, they have a... The way people

19:54.123 --> 20:03.992
speak, you know. They can tell people from 
Zacatecas right away. Once they hear him speak,

20:07.184 --> 20:09.207
you know. And for years and years and years, even 
after she was living here, my mother would... Have

20:09.548 --> 20:17.261
you been to Mexico City? Oh, yes. Oh, it's lovely. 
I've been to Zacatecas, too. I love Zacatecas.

20:24.053 --> 20:25.936
It's gorgeous. All right, let's see. This is 
fascinating. It is, it is. Isn't it interesting?

20:34.035 --> 20:40.204
Wonder, do you know, did you ever hear, was your 
father with Villa when Zacatecas was attacked? I

20:41.066 --> 20:42.027
don't know. That would be very interesting if he 
was. Very interesting. That would have been very

20:47.095 --> 20:47.856
interesting. Because he wasn't around. Your 
father wasn't around always with him. And Villa

20:52.468 --> 20:55.791
took many of his, he used most of his army. And he was 
a very good friend of Villa. Oh, he always had his

20:59.115 --> 21:00.296
picture. I mean, well, I shouldn't have given it 
away, but I didn't care. A friend of my father's,

21:05.861 --> 21:13.109
you know, when he learned that my father had died, 
he says, your father promised me a Pancho Villa's

21:05.861 --> 21:13.109
picture. I said, okay, you can have it. So I gave it 
to him. But, you know, it was something I should

21:16.709 --> 21:18.871
have kept.

21:24.577 --> 21:29.102
My mother, she always was afraid of bees, and she 
hated bees. And she married one. Did they ever? She

21:32.245 --> 21:38.832
always told me, you know, I guess she used to say, 
God punished me. I always hated bees, and I had to

21:38.992 --> 21:41.755
marry one.

21:44.333 --> 21:45.494
Now, I don't know the truth. I think she told 
Bertha. She never told me, but before I married my

21:47.296 --> 22:04.235
father, she was, I don't know, she was maybe in love 
with a telegraph operator, and he got killed by the

21:47.296 --> 22:04.235
police or something like that. That's probably 
why she hated him. Was that in Zacatecas or in

22:06.398 --> 22:08.740
Zacatecas? It was in Zacatecas. He may have been 
killed during the battle. And that would have been

22:11.597 --> 22:15.781
the Battle of Zacatecas, I believe, was in 1913. So 
that's when they left and went to Chihuahua, where

22:16.782 --> 22:23.148
she had the sister who could help her. And they 
began to work and do whatever they could, because

22:23.168 --> 22:28.434
she was working in a hospital. And it was when she 
was working in a hospital that your father was

22:29.855 --> 22:36.001
brought in with a bullet in his leg. And he was 
brought in from Celaya. And that was probably the

22:39.076 --> 22:48.046
Battle of Celaya, which would have been in... No, I 
don't know what year it was at that time. The Battle

22:48.066 --> 22:49.488
of Celaya was in 1915. Would that be the right date? 
Yeah, I think... I don't know. Yeah, I have it here

22:53.913 --> 23:01.902
on the... My tía Rosa, she married a villista, too. 
You think she was? Yeah, and he was in the hospital,

23:03.984 --> 23:07.328
too. And she had been working in the clothing 
factory, but she met this Villista. What was his

23:12.356 --> 23:14.038
name, her husband's name? Luis Gonzalez. Luis. He 
was a major in the Villas Army. And he also got

23:22.068 --> 23:26.173
wounded in that Battle of Celaya. They were both 
lucky to be alive at all, because I don't know how

23:26.193 --> 23:33.401
many thousands of Villistas were killed at 
Celaya. It was terrible. And that... I think, I'm

23:37.227 --> 23:41.052
not quite sure, but I think they were friends 
there. And I think

23:41.092 --> 23:56.113
my

23:41.092 --> 23:56.113
father, I think he introduced Luis to my aunt. And 
after they married, he didn't have to leave. Did he

23:59.555 --> 24:03.100
have to leave Luis Gonzalez and Rosa? They stayed 
in Chihuahua. They stayed in Chihuahua, that's

24:04.182 --> 24:05.544
right. So they weren't in danger, or did they have 
to hide when the Villistas were being rounded up?

24:10.211 --> 24:16.500
No, because, I mean, after he left Don Luis, I mean, 
he was at peace, in other words. Mm-hmm. He

24:19.124 --> 24:23.190
probably, I don't think he let anybody know if he 
was a Villista or not. Uh-huh. See? But... but like

24:26.705 --> 24:49.928
my mother used to call the same mother it was all 
your fault you know just yeah yeah i'm very proud of

24:26.705 --> 24:49.928
my beast and all that oh we talk too much yeah yeah 
but you but his friend your your uncle uh or your

24:26.705 --> 24:49.928
man's husband luis gonzalez kept his mouth shut 
now what kind of work did he do after he became at

24:26.705 --> 24:49.928
peace Well, I think he had a... Well, he started 
bars. He had the two bars in Chihuahua. He was

24:56.957 --> 24:58.019
doing... He was doing very well. Yeah, he was doing 
very well. So he didn't have to leave. They just

25:04.008 --> 25:06.832
left him alone because nobody remembered who he 
was. That's right. And then he had... How many

25:07.473 --> 25:09.656
children did he have? Oh, let me see. Oh. And

25:15.423 --> 25:35.794
they

25:15.423 --> 25:35.794
all Are they the bunch that you were talking about 
that you think just stayed in the bar business?

25:40.458 --> 25:41.059
Yes. And they still have, do they still have bars in 
Chihuahua? I think so. I haven't kept in touch with

25:44.564 --> 25:47.949
them for, I don't know, for about the last 10 years. 
I don't really know. In Francisco, did you put

25:49.471 --> 25:51.393
Pancho in? Yeah, Pancho. Pancho is the one that he 
sent. Yeah, he's a... He's a big shot over there in

25:56.159 --> 25:58.643
Chihuahua. Yeah, yeah. He's the one that's... 
He's a police officer down in some... Secret

26:00.926 --> 26:05.092
service or something like that. He's not... Yeah, 
well, he's something, some kind of an official, I

26:05.132 --> 26:09.679
don't know. Something big.

26:13.925 --> 26:17.471
Okay, I have Armando, Luis, Enrique, Marta, 
Francisco. And Rosa. Rosa. And they all married

26:21.256 --> 26:22.538
in... Yes. Well, let's see. Rosa's dead. Rosa's 
dead. Let's see. Armando's married. He's got a

26:32.150 --> 26:33.714
bunch of kids. He's even a grandfather by now, I 
think. And this is Luis. Luis never married. No, ni

26:43.284 --> 26:43.765
Enrique. Enrique never married. Obaldo? Married 
and divorced. And Marta married and divorced.

26:53.053 --> 26:56.976
Yeah, that's the way it goes. Do you know where Luis 
Gonzalez was from originally? Durango. From

27:02.121 --> 27:03.082
Durango. From Durango, yes. And he settled in 
Chihuahua. Yes. And then the other... Harilio,

27:07.810 --> 27:13.477
who was a blacksmith, had 12 kids, and they're all 
in Chihuahua, too. And you don't know what they do?

27:16.000 --> 27:20.085
No, the boys, I don't know what they do. You went to 
see them last time, about... The last time I went

27:22.668 --> 27:27.594
was at Chihuahua's room on Friday night. Oh, that 
was about 10 years ago, when he died in Chihuahua.

27:32.840 --> 27:35.083
And...

27:36.295 --> 27:37.096
A few years? 63? No, but my father died. Wasn't it? 
53. Oh, 50, 20 years. Yeah. 20 years. But your aunt

27:45.366 --> 27:47.649
has... Well, she's been here. She's been here. 
Have you ever thought about moving back to Mexico?

27:51.494 --> 27:52.074
Oh, no. What for? Oh,

27:52.695 --> 27:56.140
no. What is your impression of Mexico? How do you 
feel about it? No, it's all right, I guess, for some

27:59.083 --> 28:00.725
people. Vacations? Mm-hmm. Just... Staying over 
there, our kids are used to here in El Paso. Now, if

28:07.158 --> 28:09.344
they want to, they can travel. You know, my kids, 
every time we put a horse in a car or something like

28:10.025 --> 28:18.807
that, as soon as we call the cops, I mean, now we're 
breathing fresh air. So your kids like Mexico? No,

28:24.214 --> 28:24.594
no. When they cross here. No, when they cross back. 
When they cross back. They're glad that we're

28:29.700 --> 28:31.122
here. Because they have that impression, Juarez, 
it's something like Mexico. You're wrong. They

28:36.148 --> 28:39.151
haven't been to Mexico City. You're wrong. Mexico 
City is not like this at all. Well, there's some

28:42.996 --> 28:44.037
parts. They're like that. But Mexico City, 
Monterrey, Guadalajara, Every place you go, it's

28:49.465 --> 28:51.869
different. When did you go down there? No, I keep 
going down there. When was it? About two years ago,

28:57.257 --> 29:01.404
was I in Mexico City with Teresa? My daughter, 
Teresa, she got on vacation in Mexico City. San

29:05.350 --> 29:06.231
Luis Potosí. I don't like to travel. I don't know. 
In fact, we want him to go see Bertha now. In College

29:13.280 --> 29:14.904
Station? Yes. And so far. And so far. I've been 
going every year now. Every time that she has the

29:20.697 --> 29:24.045
babies, I've been going over there with Bertha. 
Now, I didn't find out, oh, that's what I wanted to

29:24.498 --> 29:27.401
know. What did your mother do after your father 
left and went back to Mexico? How did she make a

29:31.085 --> 29:33.207
living for your brothers and sisters? Well, she 
had a hard time, very hard time. She worked most of

29:36.351 --> 29:44.339
her life working the laundries.

29:44.359 --> 29:46.341
And how many brothers and sisters did you have? 
Well, only the youngest lived. Oh, that's right.

29:49.465 --> 29:53.509
And you started working. That's why I had to leave 
school. I couldn't see my mother. When did you

29:59.175 --> 30:00.917
leave school? My first year of high school. And 
then what did you do? I went to work. What sort of

30:06.283 --> 30:07.625
work? Well, I started labor. At that time, they had 
this Civilian Conservation Corps, the CCCs. I

30:14.734 --> 30:16.476
stayed there for three years. left and worked 
there at Beaumont Hospital for another three

30:16.979 --> 30:22.007
years. Then I went to the service, came out of the 
service, went to work for Southern Pacific.

30:28.757 --> 30:33.765
Worked there for about six months and then I got my 
job at Munson and I've been there since then. What

30:33.785 --> 30:34.506
do you do there? Well, I work at a department. I'm 
sort of a sporting goods clerk, you know. Oh, that

30:44.120 --> 30:45.282
sounds interesting. Take care of the sporting 
department there in Clemson. And did you, when you

30:51.123 --> 30:55.769
were a child, did your family speak Spanish or did 
they? They always did. They always did speak

30:57.111 --> 31:05.962
Spanish and that's how I learned Spanish. I 
learned to read and write just by Reading

31:11.468 --> 31:13.030
newspapers, you know. In Spanish. In Spanish, 
yeah. But you learned just English. Just English,

31:16.595 --> 31:18.377
that's right. You went to school here in El Paso. 
And your brother, your living brother, what...

31:20.981 --> 31:37.122
Well, he was, after he left school, it was during 
the war, he went to the Navy, got out of the Navy, and

31:20.981 --> 31:37.122
then came out of the Navy, got married, Lived for a 
few years and he died. Now what was his name?

31:41.375 --> 31:41.855
Rodolfo. Rodolfo.

31:46.041 --> 31:47.764
And did he have any children? Two. Two? Yeah. One 
they named Rodolfo and the other one Roberto. And

31:52.951 --> 31:53.692
what do they do? We haven't heard from them for a 
long, long time. I think they're in school,

31:56.697 --> 31:59.160
college or something. I don't know. Where do they 
live? Dallas, Texas, or Irvin? Yeah, Irvin,

32:03.695 --> 32:04.616
Texas. Irvin. Irvin, Texas. So your brother went 
on up to Dallas. Yes. Then on your father's side of

32:10.363 --> 32:13.686
the family, he had brothers and sisters too. Yes. 
He was the black sheep, I think. He was the black

32:16.990 --> 32:17.691
sheep. Let's see, the youngest was Wenceslado.

32:23.418 --> 32:26.481
And then there was Manuel.

32:27.760 --> 32:35.548
And my Tia Rosa and my father.

32:35.568 --> 32:43.396
And where did, now your father's parents were 
from, I know I've got this on tape, but I've

32:35.568 --> 32:43.396
forgotten right now. Valle de Allende. Valle de 
Allende. Chihuahua. Chihuahua. And they were

32:48.342 --> 32:49.283
farmers. They were farmers. What was your 
grandfather's name? Wenceslado. Wenceslado.

32:59.063 --> 33:00.425
and your grandmother's name. But you know, what 
was her name? I

33:05.212 --> 33:10.399
don't remember. Lupe? No, no, no, no. No, that was 
your grandmother.

33:20.554 --> 33:22.276
What was her name? I forgot now. I can't remember. 
It doesn't matter. Rosa, did Rosa marry? No, not on

33:29.033 --> 33:31.656
my father's side. Not on your father's side. She 
never married? Never married, no. And what about

33:35.039 --> 33:35.900
Manuel? He did marry. And where does, is he still 
living? No, he's in New Hampshire. And where did he

33:45.469 --> 33:47.331
live, though, didn't he? In Juarez. In Juarez? He 
always stayed in Juarez, he did. In fact, all of my

33:51.675 --> 33:56.340
brothers and sisters stayed in New Mexico. And his 
children, are they in Juarez, Manuel's children?

34:00.277 --> 34:00.978
Yes. How many does he have?

34:05.646 --> 34:11.456
I

34:05.646 --> 34:11.456
don't know, five, let's see. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I 
had one cousin that came to the United States, and

34:17.110 --> 34:31.084
they never heard of him again. It was Manuel . And 
there was . And all the other state in Mexico. And

34:39.593 --> 34:42.536
what about? Wenceslao? Wenceslao Junior. He 
stayed in Juarez. I think he came to the United

34:51.395 --> 34:56.522
States for several years because he learned to 
speak English. Oh, yes, he did. And his job in

34:57.484 --> 35:00.368
Juarez was the city guide or something like that. 
He used to make a living out of taking people.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.255
Taking the tourists around. That's right. Yeah, 
he was a city guide or something like that. And he

35:08.399 --> 35:09.481
married? He married, yes. And had? Oh, let me see. 
He had Antonio... Concepcion,

35:16.527 --> 35:25.158
Paula, Refugio, and that's it? Four? Four. And I 
think Paula and, are they here in El Paso? Yeah,

35:32.567 --> 35:34.149
Paula, do you know El Paso? No. Antonio died in El 
Paso.

35:40.216 --> 35:40.476
Antonio died. Because I think, you see, I don't 
remember now, I don't know for sure, but I think my

35:44.573 --> 36:03.333
two men made it, and my two ones, they came to the 
United States and lived in Colorado and

35:44.573 --> 36:03.333
California, some of them, for several years, and 
then they went back to Mexico. That's right. When

36:03.974 --> 36:06.597
did they come to the United States? I think it was 
the 1920s.

36:11.152 --> 36:15.557
I know that Antonio, my cousin, died last year or 
two years ago. He was born in Colorado. He was older

36:19.220 --> 36:21.102
than you, wasn't he? No, he wasn't. Do you remember 
why they came? Did they come because of the

36:26.608 --> 36:30.452
revolution or they just came for work? I don't 
know. I think they were just looking for work.

36:38.692 --> 36:44.057
Whatever happened to your grandfather's lands at 
Valladolid?

36:44.698 --> 36:46.660
Oh, I don't know. My father told me one time that 
they left them to one of the relatives and they

36:46.700 --> 36:53.447
never claimed them back or anything like that. 
They just, you know, moved out and never went back

36:53.827 --> 36:58.712
again. And this was in the 1920s and then they 
eventually settled down in Juarez. Because

37:05.050 --> 37:06.712
you're my grandfather. He died here in El Paso, my 
grandfather. He did? Yeah, on my father's side. He

37:10.658 --> 37:11.739
died here in El Paso.

37:20.292 --> 37:26.480
I don't know if I'll ever

37:20.292 --> 37:26.480
be keeping this. I don't know. Now, let's see what 
happened to your children.

37:32.894 --> 37:35.537
Who was he? That

37:36.298 --> 37:50.134
was

37:36.298 --> 37:50.134
my grandmother that my father sent. Oh, I sense 
him.

37:58.183 --> 37:59.965
Was she also from Valle de Allende? Yes. In fact, 
the sad part of this, the thing that they tell me,

38:04.221 --> 38:30.407
well, my father never admitted it, but my 
grandmother died of a heart attack because she

38:04.221 --> 38:30.407
was, when my father got wounded, he got pretty 
sick, she got a heart attack and she never

38:04.221 --> 38:30.407
recovered, or she recovered in any way, he never 
saw her again. while he was in the hospital, see?

38:34.119 --> 38:52.210
And he used to tell me that, I guess my father didn't 
care to ask about his mother, and I really don't

38:34.119 --> 38:52.210
know because one time he told me that he was out with 
some friends of his, you know, cronies, And one of

38:52.814 --> 38:55.497
them said, well, what are you talking about? You 
don't even have a mother. What do you mean I don't

38:56.638 --> 38:58.139
have a mother? Well, why don't you ask your father? 
Sure, my mother's alive. She's been dead for a year

39:01.182 --> 39:02.664
now. He didn't even know about it. And then he told 
me my father went over to my grandfather's house

39:06.127 --> 39:13.435
and got him up in the middle of the night. And my 
grandfather, he said, well, yeah, I'll wake him

39:15.337 --> 39:19.581
tomorrow morning. I'll show you the grave and all 
that. No, you show it to me right now. Don't bother

39:22.296 --> 39:23.037
me. Try to get him out of the house. And they tell me 
that my father got the gun out. He threatened my

39:30.608 --> 39:32.310
grandfather's life. He said, you show it to me 
right now or I'm going to kill you. Now, where was

39:35.214 --> 39:36.095
this? In Chihuahua. In Chihuahua. Your 
grandfather was in Chihuahua by that time. My

39:40.741 --> 39:47.070
grandfather had to get up in the middle of the 
night, take him over to the cemetery, and show him

39:40.741 --> 39:47.070
where his mother was buried. And this was before he 
left for El Paso, before he had to leave for El Paso.

39:52.405 --> 40:00.893
And how had your grandfather and grandmother 
happened to come to Chihuahua from Valle de

39:52.405 --> 40:00.893
Allende? Well, I don't know. I think that,

40:04.075 --> 40:10.761
I don't remember. I've never heard of it. But I just 
assumed that they had been following my father. I

40:17.797 --> 40:18.898
don't know. I never did find out. I was wondering if 
maybe there was trouble with the revolutionary

40:23.964 --> 40:30.372
soldiers in the area where they were trying to 
farm. The people always come into the because of

40:30.392 --> 40:41.104
the soldiers that caused the revolution because 
they were tearing up the place apart. So it's down

40:41.843 --> 40:48.496
to the south, to the southeast.

40:51.342 --> 40:55.510
Did anything happen, do you ever hear about the 
Battle of Parral? No. No, I never heard of that, the

40:57.634 --> 41:02.063
Battle of Parral, but that's where the... They 
used to mention Parral and Santa Rosalia, which

41:03.393 --> 41:13.443
they call it Camargo now, but my father always 
called it Santa Rosalia.

41:16.406 --> 41:29.940
I think they even had relatives there, I'm pretty 
sure, because on my father's side, it was a minus.

41:31.237 --> 41:40.189
The governor reminded us, remember he had a 
brother, and his brother, or my father, he always

41:31.237 --> 41:40.189
called him cousin. Whether it were cousins or not, 
I don't know. But I know that we do have relatives

41:42.552 --> 41:47.298
with the last name Mike. Even here, they came to El 
Paso, or somewhere in El Paso, I don't know where.

41:52.225 --> 41:56.991
But they had relatives all over the Parrales, 
Santa Rosalina. Do you know when that family came

41:59.131 --> 42:03.898
north to take up land there?

42:10.187 --> 42:12.690
May have been in the 1700s, perhaps. Very early. 
And then spread out, and that's why there would be

42:15.073 --> 42:19.039
all those cousins all over. Now, what I didn't find 
out about was your children. Let's see, which one

42:25.348 --> 42:27.491
is your oldest? We'll see if we remember. We'll 
see.

42:34.708 --> 42:35.469
And is he married? No, no. No. What does he do? He's 
going to, he said, last year of college. Last year

42:41.056 --> 42:42.858
of college, yeah. Where is he going to college? 
UCAP. UCAP. Oh, oh, here, here. And then he lives at

42:48.464 --> 42:49.345
home. Oh, no, he just moved out. He just moved out. 
Near the college. Near the college. He and another

42:55.292 --> 42:56.614
son of ours. What's he studying? He wants to be a 
lawyer. And

43:00.033 --> 43:05.641
then your next child is? Maria Teresa.

43:14.332 --> 43:15.674
Maria Teresa. Mm-hmm. And is she married? No, 
she's not. And what does she do? She works with Dr.

43:22.083 --> 43:25.187
Mann. Hi, Doctor. Does she live here? Yes, yes. At 
home? Yes, ma'am. And then the next child?

43:34.235 --> 43:36.058
Natalicia. Mrs. Carpenter. And she's married? 
Oh, yes. Two kids. Two little girls. Beautiful.

43:43.089 --> 43:44.451
These your first grandchildren? Yes, they are.

43:53.986 --> 43:54.627
And then there's? Alfredo. Alfredo. He's going to 
college. What's he studying? I read it, don't you?

44:03.927 --> 44:05.028
Teacher. Teacher.

44:13.116 --> 44:14.117
And then there's... Johnny. Johnny.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.182
He's his first year. I don't know what's his... Are 
they still living at home? Yes.

44:25.207 --> 44:25.828
And then... Concha. Concha. She goes to Osprey 
High School. She's in Julia. And? Luis Antonio.

44:41.065 --> 44:42.947
Goes to Osprey his first year. And then Georgie.

44:51.397 --> 44:52.979
He's in elementary school. How old is he? Twelve. 
He's one year older than my daughter. Is that

44:58.005 --> 44:58.566
right? And then I have Cecilia. Cecilia, she goes 
to school, grade school. She's in fifth grade.

45:12.211 --> 45:16.138
And then I have three miscarriages, so that's 12. 
12.

45:24.787 --> 45:26.870
My tape is done.

45:29.513 --> 45:31.435
And you go back to Mexico every so often? Or you go to 
Mexico every so often? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Well, I

45:35.140 --> 45:38.123
have my relatives over there in Mexico. So do I, but 
I don't know. But you like to travel, and I do, I do

45:39.685 --> 45:45.773
like to travel.

45:45.793 --> 45:46.293
So once in a while, I go. Every year, every two 
years, we go to Mexico. But you say your children

45:49.610 --> 45:51.554
don't like it? They don't. But have they ever been, 
any of your children, south of Chihuahua? Maria

45:57.326 --> 45:57.887
Teresa. Maria Teresa. Maria Teresa. Before, been 
to Mexico City. The other ones, no. Concha, just to

46:04.862 --> 46:08.630
Chihuahua. Chihuahua.
