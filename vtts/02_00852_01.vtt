WEBVTT

00:01.415 --> 00:08.221
Can you tell me anything since you've been here?

00:10.342 --> 00:22.373
Have you had any bad droughts or heavy rains that 
have really hurt the Bryan-Claude Station area

00:10.342 --> 00:22.373
that you know of?

00:24.614 --> 00:31.320
Oh,

00:24.614 --> 00:31.320
not anything catastrophic that I know of. And 
heavy

00:32.482 --> 00:46.562
rains coming in here messed

00:32.482 --> 00:46.562
up the bomber at different times. There's been a 
hell of a lot of dry weather all along. But not, you

00:48.124 --> 00:49.867
know, we haven't had any floods to speak of. You 
know, we've had floods in Bryan. You know, we've

00:51.429 --> 00:58.659
got some out in Carter Creek and some places

00:51.429 --> 00:58.659
like this. Nothing major. You don't have any... 
The effects of any hurricanes that hit the coast.

01:09.172 --> 01:15.239
One that never bothered me while we were here was 
the one that borrowed my house. It's a two. It's a

01:15.500 --> 01:15.720
two. And it was lucky. That's when we got all the 
people from the coast. People put them up in their

01:18.984 --> 01:21.246
homes. When I was back when I was young, I had a 
Jason. And we set up all these. Have

01:26.819 --> 01:56.269
you ever had any

02:00.451 --> 02:01.672
I can't really say big.

02:04.456 --> 02:22.377
When it comes to election time, like you're fixing 
to have

02:04.456 --> 02:22.377
one, can you ever remember one year or so

02:04.456 --> 02:22.377
when it was really important? It's important 
every time. When the people really got involved.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.762
But when the people really get involved. 
Nowadays, most people don't get involved in

02:27.316 --> 02:30.702
politics. Most elections, they won't go out and 
vote. Can you mirror any time where people really

02:33.327 --> 02:37.575
were serious about it? Oh, yeah. In the city 
election, I remember back here,

02:37.935 --> 02:48.394
and I can't remember the year, but it's probably 
been six, seven years ago. Six, seven.

02:55.143 --> 03:06.737
When the people of Bryan probably got more 
involved in the city election than they ever did at

02:55.143 --> 03:06.737
any time, that's when they had a slated option that 
we all thought we were going to get elected. Again,

03:06.757 --> 03:15.748
talking about the legislature, we were all 
backing it on, and they all got defeated.

03:15.768 --> 03:19.412
And the common man, George said, yes, we've got an 
office.

03:22.649 --> 03:27.536
Probably did about as good a job as any city council 
member. He's still in office? The whole slate

03:28.919 --> 03:30.321
hasn't gotten off. That's back when they elected 
the city commission and they elected their own

03:30.341 --> 03:36.310
mayor out of their group. They had the mayor and 
council. And they elected five of them each time.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.268
And they elected that slate five times.

03:52.214 --> 03:53.475
There was some good people, huh? Both sides. It 
kind of shocked everybody. A year ago, the mayor's

04:01.743 --> 04:06.927
race was real close. I had a lot of people involved. 
That's what Laura Jones was doing. Does Brian have

04:18.498 --> 04:20.560
a city manager form of government? Or is he the Is 
the head or is the mayor? No. Brian has the mayor and

04:26.388 --> 04:29.052
council. No city manager. And they have a city 
manager who manages them. The mayor and council

04:33.358 --> 04:39.268
are, they run it. But the city manager administers 
it. Brian Mayer, I think, makes $10 a month. The

04:46.499 --> 04:49.484
council makes $1 a month. Something like that. 
Well, the city manager makes $4 a month.

04:54.972 --> 05:02.844
They do have cities where that's why I just want to 
make sure. Has there ever been a thought where they

05:03.565 --> 05:09.293
want to change the system? The city manager might 
be over the mayor? No.

05:15.562 --> 05:22.072
Now, I don't think

05:15.562 --> 05:22.072
it works. I don't think it works. Have you ever had 
any,

05:25.145 --> 05:50.173
this is going

05:25.145 --> 05:50.173
again on politics and all, have you ever had any 
problems or any issues about rezoning the city?

05:51.217 --> 05:56.504
I've had quite an issue twice since I've been here. 
And I would like to be in to some extent, I guess.

06:00.349 --> 06:01.851
About zoning, period. I have no zoning. You have no 
zoning? I have no zoning. I was bothered on the

06:10.903 --> 06:13.706
building down here. What

06:13.746 --> 06:19.654
do you think? Is Bryan College Station very bad on 
ethnic discrimination? Where you're going to a

06:30.315 --> 06:39.606
restaurant, they make the blacks sit in one room 
and all there's nothing. They treat everybody as

06:39.626 --> 06:41.689
equal. We have blacks living all over. And that's 
how you live in everything. I know. Just down

06:52.051 --> 06:53.292
Columbus. It's pretty bad. Small town. I'm sure. I 
don't know. I'm sure.

07:08.708 --> 07:16.316
We have a black movie about what house not suddenly

07:08.708 --> 07:16.316
just started. Sure

07:16.336 --> 07:20.100
should be up. What do you think we can do about it? I 
didn't care if you lived out there. I don't live

07:26.598 --> 07:29.802
there anyway, so. But what, you know, I was upset 
about the thing that was going to affect selling

07:29.882 --> 07:34.789
our houses. And we sold several custom houses

07:34.809 --> 07:40.897
to people. So I went to every one of them and told 
them. The black blooded in there. I didn't want to

07:45.463 --> 07:47.526
have trouble then, you know. We got the thing 
built. They wanted out of contact with me out

07:48.327 --> 07:50.610
there. We had not

07:51.788 --> 08:00.621
won.

08:00.641 --> 08:06.350
Perfectly.

08:06.370 --> 08:06.590
I swear. It's strange. A man threw a gas gun at me. 
Oh,

08:11.177 --> 08:17.507
he asked me, he said, would you tell him to gas that 
man? I said, I don't want to get any food. I think...

08:20.240 --> 08:34.617
Racial discrimination

08:20.240 --> 08:34.617
behind the dollar station is

08:20.240 --> 08:34.617
certainly not bad. I don't see it as bad. I don't see 
what I'm doing. I know the off-street block people

08:36.219 --> 08:41.566
come down here and they

08:36.219 --> 08:41.566
disagree to hell with me. I know the blacks and the 
Chicano's.

08:48.218 --> 08:49.259
But they're qualified. I think we'll all hire 
them. We can't find them qualified. And we can't

08:51.983 --> 08:54.926
hire hard-hitting blacks anymore. Now, on our 
construction jobs 10 years ago, we had all kind of

08:54.946 --> 09:00.774
blacks. And the only one that we've got now is our 
plumber. He's a contractor. He's probably the

09:04.438 --> 09:07.142
best plumber contractor I've ever had work with. I 
think as much as any man works for him. But he's the

09:12.388 --> 09:12.829
only one. He's not out there. It's hard to find a job 
here. No, it's hard to find somebody to work here.

09:20.714 --> 09:22.997
We'd put anybody to work if they had work right now. 
I heard there wasn't too many jobs here. What would

09:26.961 --> 09:28.462
you define? Construction? Well, not only 
construction, anything in general. Anything to

09:34.068 --> 09:36.231
make a living. A man want to work in this town, he can 
get a job and make a living. He can. He doesn't have

09:41.156 --> 09:43.318
to go to Houston or Dallas.

09:46.370 --> 09:48.852
She'd go down there, and I'm not out here on that. 
You can talk and say, yeah, there's some boys,

09:48.872 --> 09:52.736
boys, biggies. I'm going to be a biggie. But I know 
for a fact she'd go to the son and text the father.

10:01.925 --> 10:09.032
I promise I know a boy down there going down to the 
father and make sure the job will be tight. And why

10:09.052 --> 10:13.536
they keep paying them down to the father, I don't 
know, and they work. But that's a fact. They don't

10:15.462 --> 10:24.657
know how to do anything. Anything they're 
qualified to do. But we can't hire them. That's my

10:34.071 --> 10:40.802
parents.

10:40.922 --> 10:42.685
Yeah.

10:46.428 --> 11:02.410
It's

10:46.428 --> 11:02.410
pretty interesting. Do you think, going

11:02.430 --> 11:13.746
back just a little bit, back to the college, do you 
think, what do you think about the football team?

11:13.766 --> 11:14.106
Is that affected?

11:17.478 --> 11:20.821
people around her in the spirit.

11:23.263 --> 11:29.309
Whereas everybody talks about the football team. 
I've never seen so much advertisement to go up to a

11:29.329 --> 11:41.761
Ramada Inn in Texas Avenue and after every fire 
they have to post up the scores. During the fall of

11:41.781 --> 11:44.363
the year, this community is Tied up almost 100% in 
that Texas A&M football. They're pretty proud of

11:47.718 --> 11:49.882
the team. That's right.

11:53.687 --> 11:56.632
They're like football fans, I guess, the world 
over. We had to see them get weak. I'm not angry with

11:59.616 --> 12:01.479
them. I'm on the opposite end, I guess, like all of 
you. Had a 10-2 season last year. One of the better

12:09.651 --> 12:11.093
records in the country. But you don't hear much 
good about football, do you? They lost those last

12:17.058 --> 12:20.022
two games, of course. The Aggie fans aren't all 
bad, I guess. They like to win. Of course, I

12:24.689 --> 12:30.737
understand you can't get tickets out of the 
National League. I like the spirit of Aggieland.

12:33.841 --> 12:34.062
It's great. I'm sure a lot of people don't like 
football, but it's all good. Off the top of your

12:38.407 --> 12:41.772
head.

12:53.682 --> 13:10.628
Do

12:53.682 --> 13:10.628
you think

12:53.682 --> 13:10.628
that attracts people moving here? Okay.

13:23.500 --> 13:48.252
I'm

13:23.500 --> 13:48.252
going

13:23.500 --> 13:48.252
to round this off now. Is there anything else that 
you want to add? You asked it earlier. I thank you

13:49.614 --> 13:50.155
for calling me. I appreciate it and so forth. Hey, 
look.

13:54.348 --> 14:22.515
uh... uh... uh...

14:22.968 --> 14:47.980
And

14:22.968 --> 14:47.980
I don't

14:22.968 --> 14:47.980
think

14:22.968 --> 14:47.980
anyone in the

14:22.968 --> 14:47.980
world, the committee, It's

14:48.770 --> 15:10.057
too much for the city to afford.

15:10.477 --> 15:18.507
That's right.

15:19.212 --> 15:23.418
And we've got a bond collection

15:19.212 --> 15:23.418
tomorrow. A revenue bond against the dam, the 
power plant, and so forth.

15:31.410 --> 15:31.750
Empty thing. There's a city on the opposite of 
private enterprise. That's a bond issue. Now what

15:35.356 --> 15:37.178
are they going to do after this thing? Fifteen 
million dollars so far in their sales. The law

15:40.223 --> 15:40.924
wouldn't be in place. They don't get more bond 
money than they do. Just by talking to people, do

15:42.922 --> 15:53.858
you think they voted against it or for it? I thought 
it was a package. But I haven't talked to a lot of

15:58.224 --> 15:59.606
them. But the working class people, they've come 
up with a vote. The bond issue, they've been

16:03.271 --> 16:07.397
defeated a lot more than the people last two years 
in the past. You know, we had this blue ribbon on the

16:07.517 --> 16:08.659
ground. If all these plans of Brian May's have been 
with College Station, and they jump up into

16:10.124 --> 16:24.922
College Station, they look good, but they're 
down. I mean,

16:24.942 --> 16:29.568
they're not prepared for dusting. At the College 
Station, it's pretty good-sized dusting. And so

16:31.230 --> 16:34.074
that may affect this bond issue, but people think, 
you know, these College Station don't need that

16:31.230 --> 16:34.074
power plant. What's the need? We've got that power 
plant. We're old. We get old with it. They're not an

16:36.376 --> 16:36.857
issue. But I think probably that is the biggest 
problem with saving lives

16:38.761 --> 16:51.001
in the future. Well, I sure do appreciate it. I hope 
I helped

16:54.387 --> 17:00.878
you. Okay, thank you.
