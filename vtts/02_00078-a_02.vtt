00:02.393 --> 00:04.636
How often did you go home?

00:05.678 --> 00:06.219
Twice a year.

00:07.401 --> 00:11.768
We went home at Christmas and because we're from Amarillo and it's 500 miles a little bit over there.

00:12.388 --> 00:14.852
And we charter a bus.

00:16.795 --> 00:19.980
I think one time my father might have came but I can't remember.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.928
But generally speaking we have a panhandle group of bus go up there.

00:25.609 --> 00:29.515
And he wouldn't get out of town until there was a crap game going on the floor of the bus.

00:30.794 --> 00:34.701
I wasn't a crap shooter.

00:34.721 --> 00:37.325
You don't have any idea what that bus trip cost, do you?

00:39.629 --> 00:40.911
No, let's see.

00:40.931 --> 00:46.781
I would imagine $25.

00:47.042 --> 00:51.349
Did you take any other out-of-town trips much while you were a student?

00:52.371 --> 00:55.857
Well, my freshman year, I went with...

00:56.275 --> 00:58.899
I can still remember his name, Fish Desotel and G Company.

00:58.919 --> 00:59.740
We got to be friends.

01:00.181 --> 01:02.845
And he lived down at New Gulf, Texas.

01:02.925 --> 01:06.330
His father was an engineer in a software business down there.

01:06.350 --> 01:09.754
And I went home with him on Thanksgiving, I believe, my freshman year.

01:10.596 --> 01:12.539
And I had a blind date.

01:14.261 --> 01:18.487
But to be honest, I was with a bunch of guys in high school.

01:18.747 --> 01:20.690
We were like a bunch of turkey goblers.

01:20.710 --> 01:21.532
We kept ourselves.

01:21.572 --> 01:22.353
We didn't have dates.

01:22.994 --> 01:25.337
So I believe my first date I had was down there.

01:26.127 --> 01:33.885
Let's see, during that time, was there a fish day?

01:33.925 --> 01:37.073
Yeah, I want to tell you about the famous fish day.

01:37.093 --> 01:38.115
Please, do.

01:38.316 --> 01:44.811
It was the night of, before April the first, it would be the last night of March,

01:45.044 --> 01:46.286
aired us out on the campus.

01:46.306 --> 01:50.713
This was 1937, the night before April Fool, the next day.

01:51.073 --> 01:59.566
They aired us out, and that meant that the sophomores, I can still remember running a guy strapping me with a belt behind a sophomore, and the fish all ran.

01:59.826 --> 02:03.492
They came through the dormitories hauling air out at night, and I forget what time.

02:03.809 --> 02:07.534
might have been 10 o'clock at night, something like that, probably when these two stay.

02:07.815 --> 02:18.169
The sophomores all came with belts and the freshmen all over the campus lit out for the bushes and the trees and all, and stayed out a good part of the night until the sophomores finally went to bed.

02:18.229 --> 02:21.934
And then we came back in, but next day, then we ran amok.

02:22.495 --> 02:27.882
That was the famous, the last fish day probably in A&M's history is where the freshmen took over.

02:28.683 --> 02:31.487
They all went down first place to the creamery

02:31.838 --> 02:37.105
The time I got to the creamer, there was nothing left to eat or drink, but there were experiments going on down there.

02:37.527 --> 02:38.592
Graduate students had them.

02:39.213 --> 02:40.395
That was the end of the experiments.

02:40.655 --> 02:44.681
The freshmen ate all the cheese, drank milk, ice cream.

02:44.701 --> 02:48.106
There wasn't anything left when I got there, but the train came in about that time.

02:48.567 --> 03:06.132
So I remember climbing up the side of the train and crawling through a window, and there was a woman passenger over there, and I think she liked to jump out of her pants because she jumped up kind of as I crawled through, and some of them rode the outside of the train, but I rode on the inside, and we went to Brian and got off the whole...

03:06.702 --> 03:07.624
bunch of shenanigans.

03:07.644 --> 03:10.208
Then we marched down the streets and it took over.

03:10.268 --> 03:11.110
We went to the theater.

03:12.613 --> 03:14.576
We had no money or we didn't pay for it.

03:14.596 --> 03:15.317
We just marched in.

03:15.357 --> 03:22.450
So we sort of took up the campus and the town too that day and then that afternoon they had a

03:22.430 --> 03:24.456
I guess the various outfits had it.

03:24.476 --> 03:33.180
I remember our outfit, they had a keg of beer and went out here to Fish Lake, I call it, and we threw the sophomores in the lake and when they got out we threw them back in.

03:33.441 --> 03:37.131
We all ended up probably roarsely drunk coming back to the campus.

03:37.398 --> 03:40.083
And you say that was about the last of the fish days?

03:40.243 --> 03:56.433
Well, it was the last of the big one, because I think Lewis, if I'm not, I believe he was called Connors Lewis, he was a retired general, I think it was commandant here, and the next year General Moore came in, George Moore, and that was the end of the running amok fish days.

03:56.474 --> 03:57.475
He diluted it down.

03:58.397 --> 03:59.980
But I was a sophomore then, of course.

04:00.162 --> 04:04.588
Let's see, the YMCA, what all went on at the YMCA?

04:05.108 --> 04:17.965
Well, I guess they had, we just mainly had yell practice there at night, and then occasionally we're in there, but down below, originally had been a swimming pool down there, a natatorium.

04:17.985 --> 04:18.826
Was it closed up?

04:18.886 --> 04:21.550
It was closed when I was here, but they had a barber shop down there.

04:21.990 --> 04:27.818
And so, I think, I can't remember, haircuts seemed like were kind of high down there.

04:27.878 --> 04:29.460
They were either 50 or 50.

04:29.440 --> 04:35.928
or 75 cents, and there was a guy in our outfit that could cut hair, so for two bits we got our hair cut those days.

04:35.948 --> 04:40.474
We went in and sat on a little stool in his room, and he had pretty good hair.

04:40.494 --> 04:43.097
I always wondered why he didn't stay a barber.

04:44.379 --> 04:45.701
Anyhow, that was it.

04:45.721 --> 04:49.025
And the snack bar, there was a snack bar there, wasn't there?

04:49.545 --> 04:53.551
Down below, it's parts where you got drinks and stuff, below the YMC.

04:53.591 --> 04:56.314
It's closed off now, but you can see where it used to open.

04:56.374 --> 04:57.295
It's on the north side.

04:57.395 --> 04:58.637
Where did you pick up your mail?

04:59.360 --> 05:03.326
We picked it up in the old dome building, academic building.

05:03.346 --> 05:04.988
We called it the academic building.

05:05.008 --> 05:06.210
And we picked our mail up there.

05:06.590 --> 05:13.220
Did your first year, were you obligated to pick up the mail for those upperclassmen?

05:13.320 --> 05:15.283
No, I never remember picking up anything.

05:15.303 --> 05:16.344
That wasn't part of being a maid?

05:16.865 --> 05:18.968
No, I think everybody got his own mail.

05:18.988 --> 05:19.329
I don't remember.

05:19.349 --> 05:21.552
How often did you send letters home?

05:23.335 --> 05:25.097
Oh, I don't know.

05:25.257 --> 05:25.738
Probably...

05:27.018 --> 05:28.844
Not too often.

05:28.864 --> 05:30.509
And what did you get from home?

05:31.933 --> 05:38.454
Well, as I remember, just a letter from my mother and information like that.

05:38.474 --> 05:41.162
Do you remember any important telephone calls?

05:41.564 --> 05:43.106
in your student years?

05:43.266 --> 05:43.827
No.

05:43.847 --> 05:47.873
My parents came down here though and I'll tell you something kind of funny.

05:48.634 --> 05:50.817
My parents came down here in the spring of 37.

05:51.037 --> 05:55.183
And I don't want to forget the Buffalo story either for 37.

05:55.763 --> 06:02.132
And they came down here and so I think we had a meal in the mess hall and then you know there wasn't hardly any other place to eat around here.

06:02.473 --> 06:07.540
So then we went to Bryan and we went over there I believe it was the Deluxe Cafe.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.744
There was a Deluxe Cafe on Main Street and the

06:11.281 --> 06:25.712
New York and we walked in my mother was in the lead and dad was behind I was bringing up the rear we walked in the door and one I think is one of the

06:26.232 --> 06:38.264
Cesaris brothers had the cafe then and he walked up to the door to greet us and he had on a pretty dirty looking apron and my mother didn't say a word.

06:38.324 --> 06:39.227
She looked at that apron.

06:39.668 --> 06:41.693
She made a U-turn.

06:43.833 --> 06:50.743
Another story I got to tell you, I was a witness to when President Walton came down and shot the last buffalo that A&M had.

06:50.783 --> 06:56.792
The buffalo was behind the meat, you know where the meat, what they call the old meat slab is there?

06:56.893 --> 07:05.185
It's, I don't know what building now it's called, but it was where it'sâ€¦ Near the pavilion?

07:05.225 --> 07:08.870
Yeah, it's up on the, it's that tan brick building.

07:09.271 --> 07:13.317
Well, that was the meat's laboratory there, in fact, the meat slab down below.

07:13.297 --> 07:18.529
But that was the animal science building, and the meat slab was down in the basement, yeah.

07:18.549 --> 07:28.150
Well anyhow, right behind that, out there behind that building,

07:28.602 --> 07:54.137
there was a pen, and it wasn't very much a pen, and there was a buffalo, a big buffalo in there, and the kids at that time, Consolidate was in old Pfeiffer Hall, and they would come out of Pfeiffer Hall and come up that alley, and high school kids, and they would poke maybe some sticks too, and so one of that buffalo hadn't broken out, but he didn't, so I think somebody alerted the colleagues to that possible danger, and Dr. Walton came down there with his

07:54.117 --> 08:05.854
Winchester 30-06 model 54 and shot the buffalo and I was one of the witnesses to it and then they hung him up in the meat slab and he's a big guy, I think he weighed about 1500 pounds, a big buffalo.

08:06.235 --> 08:15.488
But now I never did get the story, see I came back in 46 and worked under Dr. Schmidt in the veterinary division of the experiment station over in Francis home.

08:16.990 --> 08:23.820
We had the top floors there and he had mentioned one time they had buffalo out on the old veterinary pasture

08:24.121 --> 08:38.122
research farm now, and whether that buffalo had any relation to those, he said they had some buffalo out there, and where they got them, I don't know, but anyhow, I was a witness to when President Walton shot the buffalo.

08:38.182 --> 08:41.046
Did you ever go to the Quack Shack as a student?

08:41.146 --> 08:42.007
The Quack Shack?

08:42.027 --> 08:42.668
The hospital?

08:43.249 --> 08:44.311
Oh, is that what they called it?

08:44.691 --> 08:49.579
I don't remember that name, but yes, I went over there one time, and I can't remember now.

08:49.919 --> 08:51.782
Oh, let's see, what?

08:52.683 --> 08:53.925
I had something

08:55.070 --> 09:00.277
I was there just a day or two, but I don't know what it was.

09:00.357 --> 09:01.779
Do you remember who the doctors were?

09:01.799 --> 09:02.901
Oh, yeah, Dr. Morris.

09:03.461 --> 09:09.149
He had the reputation, if you went over there with a pain in your abdomen or stomach, you're going to lose your appendix.

09:09.169 --> 09:10.911
But he was an expert on that.

09:11.452 --> 09:13.735
And Ma Cleggern, yeah, she was a nurse.

09:13.956 --> 09:15.077
I think she was an old Army nurse.

09:15.418 --> 09:16.779
She was there with Dr. Morris.

09:19.223 --> 09:19.944
Guyon Hall.

09:20.444 --> 09:21.045
Yeah.

09:21.145 --> 09:22.667
Do you remember any big events in Guyon?

09:22.687 --> 09:24.570
Yeah, I can tell you a great big event.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.063
never been duplicated before or since.

09:27.644 --> 09:29.647
We were supposed to have our graduation this was 1941.

09:30.568 --> 09:51.080
Now we didn't have finals that year so I got married the day after I graduated over here in Bryan and home and so we had a week off we went to Galveston on our honeymoon and then came back on the 4th of June I believe it was and got our diplomas so we had a week in there that we didn't take finals and so you do whatever.

09:51.521 --> 09:53.764
We came back and so

09:55.229 --> 10:05.880
My parents were there for graduation, all the parents were, and we were supposed to have it in Kyle Field, but Guy and Hall, you know, was a very long, narrow hall, and we were packed like sardines in that thing.

10:06.140 --> 10:18.193
The parents were over here, and I never told this to very many people, but anyhow, all the graduates were in that long, narrow aisle of Guy and Hall standing up.

10:18.513 --> 10:21.356
There was no place to sit down because parents had it on each side of it.

10:21.376 --> 10:24.780
You'd know Guy and Hall, how narrow and long.

10:25.283 --> 10:28.168
They started out, of course, with the A's, agricultural events.

10:28.188 --> 10:30.251
We were very last to the back door back there.

10:30.591 --> 10:31.813
So I don't know who it was.

10:31.954 --> 10:34.217
I had a car my last year here.

10:34.698 --> 10:35.499
I was here five years.

10:35.519 --> 10:36.661
Last year I had a car.

10:37.282 --> 10:41.048
And long after it had gone on so long, somebody said, hey,

10:41.028 --> 10:42.229
Ted, let's go get a beer.

10:42.650 --> 10:46.834
So there were about four of us got in my car, and nobody missed us.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.376
We went over to the East Gate.

10:48.436 --> 10:50.478
It's where Wilson Plumbing used to be.

10:50.498 --> 10:51.499
I can't remember.

10:51.520 --> 10:55.244
This building is still there, but that was where you'd get beer there in those days, on the East Gate.

10:55.584 --> 10:58.467
So we went over there and had us a beer and came back, and nobody ever missed us.

10:58.988 --> 11:03.973
So we were maybe one of the few senior graduating classes ever went to get a beer during graduation.

11:03.993 --> 11:05.635
A beer during graduation.

11:05.733 --> 11:09.242
Uh, what, uh, were there movies regularly in Guyon?

11:09.262 --> 11:18.426
Yeah, and Sunday, oh, they were, they almost oughta had to pay you to go to them, but what we did in Guyon, not in Guyon Hall, in the old, uh,

11:18.794 --> 11:21.380
What was that called, the old... Movie theater?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.023
Movie theater, yeah, whatever it was called.

11:23.945 --> 11:29.056
We'd go over there, and the main thing you did was buy peanuts for Nicholas Big Sac and throw peanuts.

11:29.337 --> 11:36.893
But the government had old movies, those old depression movies that were, to us students, they were bore us to death.

11:36.953 --> 11:38.136
So that was about what it was.

11:38.690 --> 11:42.154
What about some of the big social events in Cebisa?

11:42.594 --> 11:44.997
Yeah, they had like senior ring dance.

11:45.438 --> 12:03.398
I remember I took my wife, well, we weren't married then, but wife-to-be to the senior ring dance, and I remember that they'd have band leaders come down for a couple of nights, like some of the top ones,

12:03.783 --> 12:04.364
Dorsey's?

12:04.444 --> 12:06.988
Dorsey and what was the black?

12:08.270 --> 12:08.891
Duke Ellington?

12:08.911 --> 12:10.112
Duke Ellington, yeah.

12:10.132 --> 12:14.819
I think he was there when I was the senior ring dance when I took my wife to be there.

12:15.220 --> 12:21.369
And the thing was so nice, the favors were the duplicate of your Aggie ring and a pin.

12:21.649 --> 12:25.815
My wife had it for long years, but it finally disappeared, I think somebody told me.

12:25.835 --> 12:28.499
All right, how did you meet this special young lady?

12:29.301 --> 12:32.305
Well, she was, she'd grown up

12:32.707 --> 12:35.312
out here in the Brass Bottom, a poor tenant farmer's daughter.

12:35.953 --> 12:36.955
She was hard of hearing.

12:37.015 --> 12:42.686
I think she had, her mother seemed to think she'd had scarlet fever or something that affected her hearing.

12:43.007 --> 12:45.672
So she couldn't really, but she was a lip reader.

12:45.692 --> 12:48.638
She could carry on a conversation with you by reading your lips.

12:48.718 --> 12:49.399
It was amazing.

12:49.379 --> 13:01.354
But she didn't have a way to get into school after the sixth grade out in the country, so one year she helped Mrs. Mirka, who I don't know if you ever knew Mrs. Mirka over here that she did taught for years.

13:01.554 --> 13:03.616
Well, she helped her out at Smithtown, and we have a picture.

13:04.097 --> 13:08.322
I'd like to show you that picture of her in the class helping Mrs. Mirka with a student.

13:08.342 --> 13:10.645
Now, whether she got any remuneration or not, I don't know.

13:10.709 --> 13:14.516
But anyhow, when I met her, she was down here working in Ms.

13:14.536 --> 13:17.701
Payne's beauty shop, which was just behind the city barber shop.

13:18.122 --> 13:19.925
It's now Masonic Lodge, I think.

13:20.246 --> 13:22.250
But her husband, Ms.

13:22.290 --> 13:23.752
Payne's husband, was an optometrist.

13:23.772 --> 13:26.818
He had his little business there, and she had a beauty shop in the back.

13:26.878 --> 13:30.484
My wife worked there, and that's where I met her, down there at one time.

13:31.045 --> 13:33.730
When you were dating, where did you take your date?

13:35.212 --> 13:46.807
Well, I remember the first picture we ever went to, a picture show at the Old Palace Theater, she wanted to see Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath because she'd grown up under those kind of conditions.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.210
And that's one of the first movies we ever went to.

13:49.230 --> 13:54.557
And then we only dated a couple months before we got married.

13:54.577 --> 13:57.821
Yeah, there's a picture right there.

13:58.822 --> 14:00.164
Remember, you got that thing off.

14:00.184 --> 14:04.189
Yeah, well, I'll show it to you.

14:04.473 --> 14:09.000
Let's see, were there religious activities on the campus or near the campus then?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.101
Yeah, there were.

14:10.982 --> 14:12.625
I'm sure I wasn't, of course, Catholic.

14:12.665 --> 14:17.772
I'd raised in a Baptist church, but I didn't much go to church after I came down here.

14:18.253 --> 14:19.715
Did many of the students attend?

14:22.739 --> 14:24.923
I don't remember in our outfit of many attending.

14:25.043 --> 14:26.565
I'm sure there were some, but...

14:27.153 --> 14:34.483
I have to admit that I'm not particularly proud of it, but I really don't remember going to church much when I was a student.

14:35.405 --> 14:35.785
Let's see.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.229
Football games were at Kyle Field.

14:38.249 --> 14:40.252
Basketball was at DeWare Fieldhouse.

14:40.552 --> 14:42.555
Describe basketball.

14:43.536 --> 14:54.612
You know, Haskell, to be honest, I never was much into basketball, but I'm sure I went to some games, but I just don't have a good recollection of it.

14:54.862 --> 14:58.406
Were the Yale leaders important in those days?

14:58.426 --> 14:58.847
Oh, yeah.

14:59.007 --> 15:01.650
Yeah, the Yale leaders were always in white.

15:01.710 --> 15:06.415
And then we'd have, see, we'd have Yale practice in front of the YMCA at night.

15:06.936 --> 15:10.900
And this farmer's fight, I was telling somebody how they've slowed it down.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.343
It used to be a real peppy farmer's fight, farmer's fight, fight, fight, fight.

15:13.603 --> 15:15.966
But now the farmer's fight, farmer's.

15:15.986 --> 15:16.887
I'd have a football game.

15:16.927 --> 15:18.849
I was telling somebody, boy, they slowed it down over the years.

15:19.971 --> 15:22.093
About, did you have a budget?

15:22.133 --> 15:23.755
How much money did you have to spend?

15:24.562 --> 15:32.935
Well, my folks would send me money, but I never, you know, made many trips.

15:32.955 --> 15:42.490
I made all the court trips and things, but I would say $500 a year would allow me to have a little spending money and go to court trips and so on.

15:42.530 --> 15:46.276
So I'd say my whole college, five years of college, cost me about $2,500.

15:46.396 --> 15:48.860
Did you ever hitchhike?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.042
Oh yeah, I hitchhiked.

15:50.062 --> 15:50.923
Describe that.

15:50.971 --> 15:53.714
Well, I'll tell you one notable hitchhike I never forgot.

15:54.034 --> 16:01.583
I got out on the highway to Amarillo and I got a ride right off the highway to Wichita Falls.

16:02.263 --> 16:04.706
I no sooner got out on the highway to Wichita Falls.

16:05.187 --> 16:06.528
Of course, we're in uniforms, you know.

16:07.089 --> 16:11.033
And here comes an ex-Aggie from Wyoming going down to Houston.

16:11.293 --> 16:15.558
And he picked me up and I got two rides right out here in front of the college.

16:15.578 --> 16:18.261
That was the most memorable, but I remember one time I was

16:18.460 --> 16:24.528
Way up at night, stranded west of Fort Worth Highway, and a trucker picked me up, so we used to highway.

16:24.568 --> 16:27.151
Did you ever have a bad hitchhiking experience?

16:27.171 --> 16:27.832
No, I never did.

16:28.132 --> 16:31.576
I haven't had any Aggie yet describe a bad experience.

16:32.057 --> 16:32.938
I'll tell you one thing.

16:33.339 --> 16:35.221
I remember this trucker picked me up one night.

16:35.241 --> 16:37.043
Oh, it was late at night.

16:37.884 --> 16:44.873
Oh, probably 11 o'clock at night or so, and I was on the highway west of Fort Worth, and this trucker picked me up, and we got to talking, and he couldn't believe

16:45.393 --> 16:49.038
that I'd be hitchhiking based on who my father was.

16:49.058 --> 16:49.820
That was so funny.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.303
He just couldn't believe it.

16:53.104 --> 16:54.486
Let's see, Reveille.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.049
Yeah, Reveille.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.711
Was the original Reveille still living?

16:57.731 --> 16:58.112
Oh, yeah.

16:58.252 --> 17:02.679
And there was a senior now that he would have graduated in 37.

17:02.739 --> 17:04.942
He claimed he was one of them, but I don't know.

17:05.783 --> 17:09.409
He claimed he was one of them that picked Reveille up as a pup down there on the highway.

17:09.649 --> 17:13.054
Do you remember any story he told about that experience?

17:13.388 --> 17:17.678
Not exactly that just he and some others saw this dog and picked it up.

17:17.719 --> 17:18.962
That's just in general.

17:18.982 --> 17:20.666
Describe the original Reveille.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.152
What kind of dog and what did she look like?

17:23.312 --> 17:27.041
Well, there's the best picture in the world over here in town barbecue of her.

17:27.322 --> 17:28.003
Oh, no, I know.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.532
Well, she was just a little...

17:31.512 --> 17:35.838
black with a white, let's see, white nose, did you have white feet?

17:35.878 --> 17:37.100
I can't, but mainly black.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.704
And I'll tell you an interesting thing.

17:40.164 --> 17:42.227
She was a racist.

17:42.247 --> 17:44.791
I saw her more than once and other people told me the same thing.

17:45.192 --> 17:50.900
If a black person crossed the campus, which was just usually a worker or somebody, she would start barking.

17:50.920 --> 17:56.127
She may be mistreated or something, but she would bark all of his heels till he got off of campus.

17:56.228 --> 17:57.349
I remember that.

17:57.469 --> 17:59.292
And how big a dog?

17:59.272 --> 18:03.460
Oh, golly, she was, uh, what?

18:04.553 --> 18:06.436
Eighteen inches high, maybe, something like that.

18:06.456 --> 18:09.119
And reckon of what mixed breeds?

18:09.259 --> 18:10.561
Oh, golly, I don't know.

18:11.122 --> 18:13.886
She was just a nondescript mutt approach.

18:13.906 --> 18:15.147
And compared to her short hair.

18:15.468 --> 18:16.269
Yeah, yeah, right.

18:16.369 --> 18:16.970
She was short-haired.

18:17.290 --> 18:23.639
And a nice-looking, like I say, I can see her when I see that picture of Tom Barbecue.

18:23.659 --> 18:25.201
It's just a photo of her.

18:25.541 --> 18:29.346
During your student days, in what dormitory did Raveli normally see?

18:29.366 --> 18:32.130
I would think, it seemed like to me we very seldom saw her

18:32.110 --> 18:33.533
around over in our area.

18:33.553 --> 18:42.111
See, we were right across from Bazell Hall and Hart, and then next to it in Goodwin, and then I was back in Hart my third year, and then the fourth year I was on the campus.

18:42.212 --> 18:44.557
I was with the football boys over in the Newdarms.

18:44.577 --> 18:49.107
They built the M38, so in 39 I was in the Newdarm, and last year I was off the campus.

18:49.147 --> 18:51.672
So you think she was over in the Northgate area?

18:51.702 --> 18:56.087
I think she was mostly around law and prayer would be my idea.

18:56.107 --> 18:57.589
And maybe some of those other, Mitchell or something.

18:57.609 --> 19:02.114
Did you see her much in the classroom buildings during the daytime?

19:02.134 --> 19:03.695
No, I don't recall seeing her much.

19:03.715 --> 19:04.857
What about in the dining hall?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.560
No, I never saw her in the dining hall.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.282
I don't believe she was allowed in the dining hall.

19:10.523 --> 19:13.146
Because, see, that was in the jurisdiction pretty much of the Army.

19:13.587 --> 19:17.271
Those enlisted men were at the door there in Sabisa Hall.

19:17.992 --> 19:19.313
So I don't think they put up with her.

19:20.423 --> 19:25.929
During your years here, describe the typical Aggie student.

19:26.409 --> 19:27.451
Where were they from?

19:27.611 --> 19:28.792
What kind of families?

19:28.852 --> 19:30.153
What were their attitudes?

19:31.094 --> 19:37.161
Well, of course these were Depression boys, you know, that came here in those days.

19:37.661 --> 19:43.748
I was in the Amarillo Company, but I was the only fresh

19:45.297 --> 19:49.793
I don't remember another freshman from Amarillo, sophomores mainly.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.138
Could I get you some warmer coffee?

19:51.158 --> 19:52.965
No, no, I'm doing fine.

19:54.430 --> 19:57.501
And the Hill Country boys, mostly our outfit

19:57.616 --> 20:07.829
There were some South Texas boys from down in South Texas, and I'd say mostly came out from farms and ranches.

20:07.849 --> 20:10.252
I was more or less a city boy.

20:11.073 --> 20:13.937
Were they poor, working class, rich?

20:15.559 --> 20:19.103
I would say the great majority of them were German boys now.

20:19.143 --> 20:24.650
The Hill Country boys were German, and they were probably from the ranch and grew up on a ranch.

20:25.071 --> 20:26.813
I guess they had...

20:27.012 --> 20:34.279
Folks probably had a little money and sent them to school, but some of them worked, you know, in the mess halls and things like that, waiters and things.

20:34.600 --> 20:38.604
Well, in their attitudes, what, in their behavior?

20:39.485 --> 20:44.249
Well, as a real leader, pretty well, our attitude was pretty well behaved.

20:44.930 --> 20:46.512
I want to tell you a story before I forget it.

20:46.852 --> 20:48.854
This happened in A Company when I was a freshman.

20:48.874 --> 20:49.955
I believe it was A Infantry.

20:49.975 --> 20:53.779
They were in, I believe, Foster Hall.

20:54.198 --> 21:07.626
You know, I remember an hour of dormitory and it was common, I think, a student would have a candy concession and you have a table sitting in the hall with a cigar box and then the candy and you put your money in the cigar box.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.452
Well, this, I wasn't a witness to this, but

21:10.685 --> 21:28.145
I heard it from pretty reliable sources, I believe it was over in Foster Hall, right at the beginning of school when the people first came in, they caught a couple of guys, somebody caught them, pre-freshmen, no they didn't roll, all right, taking money out of the cigar box, stealing money, and they kicked them out.

21:28.185 --> 21:29.046
Now who kicked them out?

21:29.106 --> 21:32.590
I don't have all those details, but probably somebody told the seniors and they said hit the road.

21:32.610 --> 21:37.215
Well, in those days we called the commandant the bull's office, that is a common, you know, bull.

21:37.195 --> 21:41.861
And about three days after school started, the bull called over and wanted to know where these students were.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.525
And somebody told them they hit the road, they were stealing.

21:44.765 --> 21:45.526
And that was all.

21:45.827 --> 21:47.349
Can you imagine what would happen today?

21:47.389 --> 21:48.671
Today we'd have to have three.

21:48.691 --> 21:51.655
Car loads of lawyers on both sides.

21:51.735 --> 21:52.796
That was a simple matter.

21:53.597 --> 21:55.400
Was the campus basically honest then?

21:55.720 --> 21:56.521
I think it was, yeah.

21:56.541 --> 21:58.063
Did you, you didn't lock your room?

21:58.364 --> 21:58.584
No.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.089
And we didn't have anything stolen.

22:02.129 --> 22:03.311
Didn't have anything stolen.

22:03.391 --> 22:05.253
No, I don't think there was anything.

22:05.273 --> 22:06.595
How many students had cars?

22:07.992 --> 22:12.278
Well, now, see, I didn't have a car in my fifth year when I was off campus.

22:12.839 --> 22:16.264
But I'll tell you, I'll tell you, Haskily, I would like to see a picture.

22:16.284 --> 22:19.669
And I asked Dave Chapman about it, and he couldn't come up with the picture.

22:19.989 --> 22:30.465
But I well remember, when I was 36, and I don't know for how long, all the off-campus parking was across the post office up there for about 60 to 75 yards down there.

22:30.485 --> 22:31.546
That was all the parking.

22:31.867 --> 22:32.808
Now, you wouldn't believe that.

22:32.828 --> 22:34.911
Today, a person that says all this...

22:35.296 --> 22:37.956
Giant traffic jam here wouldn't believe it, but that's what it was.

22:38.359 --> 22:40.817
So I don't think...

22:41.270 --> 22:43.672
I don't think many seniors even had cars.

22:43.772 --> 22:45.233
Even some of the profs didn't have cars.

22:45.674 --> 22:48.416
And most of the faculty and staff lived on the campus.

22:48.436 --> 22:49.017
Right.

22:49.037 --> 22:54.642
Did you students ever make any noise over there, ever play any pranks on their houses?

22:54.662 --> 22:55.382
No, I never did.

22:55.823 --> 22:57.384
Now whether there was any done, I don't know.

22:57.404 --> 22:58.405
I'm not heard of any.

22:58.425 --> 23:00.747
No, I haven't either.

23:01.207 --> 23:06.832
Did you notice any of the little boys, like did you know Little Red Cashin and any of those kids?

23:06.912 --> 23:08.253
No, I didn't know them.

23:08.273 --> 23:09.154
When they were growing up?

23:09.194 --> 23:10.315
No, I sure didn't.

23:11.678 --> 23:20.986
Let's see, what did, on a wild Saturday night, if a group of Aggies were going to have a big time, where did they go and what did they do?

23:21.127 --> 23:22.728
Well, I'll give you a good example.

23:22.748 --> 23:32.457
We had a little fellow in our outfit named Hatch, and he would, he was a short little old fellow and very slim.

23:32.477 --> 23:39.103
He would go to, Brian, this is just one extreme example though, but he would go to Brian on a Saturday afternoon and he would,

23:40.096 --> 23:47.046
I never went with him, but I had good authority that by midnight when he came staggering back to the campus, he would have gone through a case of beer.

23:48.388 --> 23:50.351
But that was about what they'd do.

23:50.371 --> 23:54.297
Some of the Aggies would go to Bryan and drink beer.

23:54.757 --> 23:58.643
What were the best known places to drink beer?

23:58.663 --> 24:01.828
Well, like I say, Deluxe Cafe in Bryan.

24:01.848 --> 24:02.629
That was one of them.

24:02.969 --> 24:04.091
There were some other places.

24:04.772 --> 24:07.656
Now, when I was a senior, we would...

24:08.412 --> 24:24.058
We had a friend who had a car out east my first year before I had a car and we would borrow the car out in the country and then we'd go to the Deluxe Cafe and have an open paste steak sandwich on a Saturday night, my friend and I.

24:24.376 --> 24:33.974
maybe a few other vets and then we had this car and then we'd go picking up some, try to pick up some dates and just go honky-tonking around, but that was a senior.

24:34.234 --> 24:36.078
Not only a freshman, sophomore, junior.

24:36.138 --> 24:37.420
Was Uncle Ed's open yet?

24:37.500 --> 24:38.262
Oh yeah, yeah.

24:38.282 --> 24:40.506
Describe Uncle Ed's.

24:41.107 --> 24:43.050
Hard lickers, yeah.

24:43.070 --> 24:45.034
Do you know, to be honest, Askel, I never,

24:46.364 --> 24:47.825
I don't think I was ever in there.

24:47.886 --> 24:50.989
Now, with Franklin's, I was at Franklin's.

24:51.009 --> 24:52.170
That was another little place later on.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.211
Describe Franklin's.

24:53.231 --> 24:55.714
Well, it was just a little place sitting back in the woods there.

24:56.114 --> 24:56.695
Where was it?

24:57.355 --> 24:58.657
Where was Franklin's?

24:58.977 --> 25:01.279
It's out on West University Drive.

25:01.299 --> 25:05.063
I think you can still see the little clearing there where it was on the right.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.466
And it's nothing there anymore.

25:07.486 --> 25:09.147
All right.

25:09.167 --> 25:10.429
On the north side?

25:10.749 --> 25:12.010
It'd be on the north side.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.772
Beyond where the vet school is now.

25:13.887 --> 25:17.153
Oh yeah, it's past the vet school out there in the bushes.

25:17.474 --> 25:21.241
It'd be across roughly from the University Park there.

25:21.261 --> 25:25.370
And it's just a little old white building as I recall.

25:25.410 --> 25:28.295
All right, now beer was legal in Brazos County at that time.

25:28.576 --> 25:31.061
Yeah, apparently so, because you'd get it over at the Eastgate.

25:31.241 --> 25:34.668
Where did people... There wasn't a Northgate beer place like it is now, no.

25:34.928 --> 25:36.351
Where did people get whiskey?

25:37.023 --> 25:40.187
You went across the river to right across the river bridge.

25:40.267 --> 25:41.469
Did y'all call it Whiskey Bridge?

25:41.749 --> 25:44.693
Yeah, they called it Whiskey Bridge, but I never was into whiskey much.

25:44.793 --> 25:48.177
I didn't drink occasional beer, but I never went.

25:48.277 --> 25:49.438
Did you ever go to the clay pits?

25:51.701 --> 25:53.243
No, I heard of them.

25:53.263 --> 25:56.287
I've seen them, but I don't think I ever went there in my student days.

25:56.427 --> 25:59.151
I don't really know what all went on out there.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.793
What were people smoking then?

26:02.915 --> 26:03.396
Smoking?

26:05.118 --> 26:06.760
Well, cigar and cigarettes, all I know.

26:07.145 --> 26:10.630
I never heard of pot in those days.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.452
Did anybody roll their own cigarettes?

26:13.093 --> 26:18.460
Yeah, I believe a few of those old boys from the cow country rolled their cigarettes, yeah.

26:19.761 --> 26:21.704
And did anybody, did students smoke a pipe?

26:23.647 --> 26:24.347
Let me see.

26:24.408 --> 26:28.032
Seems like I remember one of those German boys smoking a pipe.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.654
Were you allowed to smoke in your room?

26:30.776 --> 26:31.737
In your dormitory room?

26:31.777 --> 26:33.239
Yeah, I think so.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.300
Best I remember.

26:34.320 --> 26:37.084
But I never had any roommates that smoked.

26:37.756 --> 26:42.865
Uh, and you, did you even know the word marijuana when you were?

26:42.885 --> 26:44.708
No, I never, don't think I'd ever heard of that.

26:45.849 --> 26:47.993
And I'm a little younger than you and I sure hadn't either.

26:48.314 --> 26:50.317
I want to tell you something before I forget though.

26:50.337 --> 26:50.437
Okay.

26:51.098 --> 27:00.574
Do you have any idea how much, when I was a freshman, I don't know whether it went on how much longer after that, but do you have any idea how much it cost you if you were an Aggie on the campus to go to Bryan?

27:02.427 --> 27:10.920
A guy, and I don't know, there were more than one person, whether it was a company or what, I never found out, but there were guys that were constantly driving around through the campus.

27:11.301 --> 27:14.666
And if they picked up five Aggies, it was a dime apiece to go to Brown.

27:14.947 --> 27:16.309
If they picked up one Aggie, it was a quarter.

27:16.369 --> 27:17.671
Have you, I guess you've heard that before.

27:17.691 --> 27:18.292
No, no, that's good.

27:18.312 --> 27:18.472
Yeah.

27:19.213 --> 27:19.654
Quarter to go.

27:19.674 --> 27:21.617
Where these, these were not students.

27:22.289 --> 27:23.370
No, I don't think so.

27:23.410 --> 27:34.043
They were just people, and I really, I'm sure you can find the history of them, but I don't know their background or anything, but they'd cruise around the campus, and you wouldn't have to wait long if somebody would come by, and that was the rage.

27:34.063 --> 27:36.186
And they were not officially taxis?

27:36.206 --> 27:36.947
I don't think so, no.

27:37.227 --> 27:38.609
What was at the North Gate?

27:38.629 --> 27:40.491
Describe the businesses at North Gate.

27:40.792 --> 27:51.064
Well, there was, as I recall, both those, where Lupot's building was, that building was there, and, of course, Hollick's Boot Shop was there.

27:51.128 --> 28:05.543
By the way, my wife was kind of related to the Hollicks, and I don't know if you've ever heard this story, but Johnny Hollick, he's still living over there, the last of the Hollick brothers, he told me that his dad, who started the first Aggie band here,

28:05.776 --> 28:08.360
Joe Hollick, and he lived to be 103 I think.

28:09.061 --> 28:15.450
Old Joe, Brian, when he passed, when he was about to pass away, I don't know how many years he was blind, but he was a cowboy.

28:15.730 --> 28:25.524
He came here and Saul Ross gave him a room over in one of the dormitories to fix Aggie boots and shoes, and then from there he went on and became a, he was a musician.

28:26.605 --> 28:32.053
But Johnny told me that Saul Ross gave him a room to work on boots and shoes for the cadets.

28:32.033 --> 28:35.337
Alright, was the campus theater open when you were a student?

28:35.377 --> 28:36.278
Yeah, it was open.

28:36.358 --> 28:37.599
How often did students go?

28:38.901 --> 28:42.525
Well, I'm sure you went on the weekends.

28:43.006 --> 28:45.549
Do you remember any movies you saw that were special to you?

28:46.430 --> 28:46.810
Anywhere?

28:46.930 --> 28:57.423
No, I remember, well, let's see, the movie I must remember is when my wife and I was telling you we went to Palace and saw Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath.

28:57.643 --> 29:01.247
Grapes of Wrath.

29:01.497 --> 29:12.012
Now I've heard that people during Guy and Hall movies, or maybe the old movie theater, that they would, you said they'd throw peanuts and they also made noise too, didn't they?

29:12.032 --> 29:27.994
Yeah, Sunday afternoon, it was, I'd say the most boring movies that you'd ever seen in your life, the government made them, and I guess they were free, and I don't think you wouldn't have paid for them, so you'd better spot peanuts and threw peanuts mainly, peanuts all over the floor.

29:28.075 --> 29:31.098
Did the Tessies come down here for dates during that?

29:31.158 --> 29:41.989
Yeah, they would vacate a dorm and when they had dances here they would vacate a dorm for the girls and they'd come down here, yeah.

29:42.009 --> 29:42.809
How were they treated?

29:43.991 --> 29:44.591
Well, pretty well.

29:44.631 --> 29:51.718
I never had a date but some of them were kind of, you know.

29:52.119 --> 29:53.560
Did they come on the train or the bus?

29:55.075 --> 29:57.943
You know I'm not for sure, but they did.

29:57.984 --> 29:59.969
I remember vacating a few times.

30:01.775 --> 30:02.818
What'd you do in the summers?

30:03.620 --> 30:09.979
Well, I went, my dad, my first year here in 36, I went home Christmas.

30:10.533 --> 30:14.259
I think we went on a bus then, you know, and then he took me out.

30:14.279 --> 30:19.848
He just bought the ranch in November and he took me out there to see the ranch in the winter of 36.

30:20.729 --> 30:27.961
And then, well, we just had our Christmas there and then came on back to A&M.

30:28.021 --> 30:33.609
And then school in those days wasn't out before Christmas.

30:33.990 --> 30:35.773
You had midterm after January there.

30:36.294 --> 30:38.397
That's what I was telling you about that big ice storm I had.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.966
But then in the summer, did you have jobs back home?

30:41.146 --> 30:44.675
Well, then that summer, I went back on the ranch.

30:44.756 --> 30:46.741
That was the summer of 37, yeah.

30:47.182 --> 30:52.656
And I worked on the ranch that summer, and then the following summer.

30:53.648 --> 30:57.816
Doing regular ranch work, you know, digging post holes, putting up hay and stuff.

30:57.836 --> 31:01.884
All right, and you're admitted to vet school at the end of your first year here?

31:02.344 --> 31:03.727
The first semester.

31:04.729 --> 31:09.598
Well, no, I changed the veterinary medicine at midterm of 37, but then I...
