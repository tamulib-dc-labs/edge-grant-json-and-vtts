WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:07.459
One day T-Sips tried to firebomb it.

00:07.810 --> 00:20.168
And so we were out, well, we'd always been out guarding the perimeter at night, but we were reinforced then.

00:21.309 --> 00:22.491
So this is during your time?

00:22.591 --> 00:22.811
Yes.

00:22.832 --> 00:23.012
Oh, yes.

00:23.533 --> 00:25.295
Is this when the light plane flies over?

00:25.435 --> 00:26.337
Yes, yes.

00:26.797 --> 00:28.259
Well, describe that.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.002
Well, that's all there was.

00:30.102 --> 00:32.265
I mean, it just flew over.

00:32.802 --> 00:39.757
Supposedly tried to drop a Molotov cocktail on it, but that green wood, it wouldn't have done anything.

00:39.777 --> 00:40.839
Was this daylight or dark?

00:40.879 --> 00:42.021
Daylight, as I recall.

00:43.745 --> 00:50.018
But in those days, you know, there weren't many airplanes around.

00:50.707 --> 00:57.173
Do you remember any good anecdotes from Bonfire in your era?

00:58.274 --> 00:59.696
Stories, myths, legends?

01:00.176 --> 01:04.881
No, not really, other than the TU attempt to bomb it.

01:05.942 --> 01:11.067
What were the worst injuries that you recalled during your four years?

01:11.887 --> 01:13.789
I don't recall any.

01:13.809 --> 01:18.874
It was remarkably injury-free.

01:19.867 --> 01:23.413
But there must have been occasionally somebody would get a little bit of an ax cut or.

01:23.914 --> 01:26.719
Oh yeah, but I don't remember anything serious.

01:26.880 --> 01:34.934
I don't remember anybody being killed or, I mean, anything that stuck in my mind.

01:34.994 --> 01:38.601
Was just about everybody involved in Bonfire?

01:39.239 --> 01:45.485
Well, all the Corps was and the veterans didn't get involved, but the Corps, everybody.

01:46.145 --> 01:52.351
Now in your day did you have to be in the Corps all four years or could you drop out after two?

01:52.651 --> 01:54.013
No, I had to be in all four years.

01:54.133 --> 01:54.933
All four, okay.

01:55.694 --> 01:58.276
But didn't have to?

02:01.600 --> 02:08.706
There were some people kicked out of the Corps who were allowed to stay in school.

02:09.513 --> 02:11.195
I think Bill Clayton was one of those.

02:11.895 --> 02:13.457
Really?

02:13.957 --> 02:14.458
I believe you.

02:14.778 --> 02:16.480
But they were looked down upon, weren't they?

02:17.241 --> 02:17.441
Yeah.

02:17.481 --> 02:18.322
Oh, yeah.

02:18.342 --> 02:24.748
Yeah.

02:25.108 --> 02:27.371
There weren't very many of those.

02:29.032 --> 02:33.997
Describe getting your special kind of ring.

02:36.299 --> 02:38.862
Well, that's something that you're

02:39.365 --> 02:47.082
Look forward to from day one and then when the day comes it's quite a thrill to put it on.

02:47.443 --> 02:48.465
Do you remember what it cost?

02:48.485 --> 02:50.931
I think it cost $100.

02:51.652 --> 02:55.441
And was that your money or mom and dad's money or do you remember?

02:55.461 --> 02:58.167
I don't remember.

03:03.344 --> 03:04.005
I don't remember.

03:05.167 --> 03:13.140
Surely you have some ring stories of either where you lost it or where somebody, you're somewhere on the other side of the world and somebody sees it.

03:13.841 --> 03:14.643
Share some of those.

03:15.945 --> 03:25.200
In 1979 we went on this tour of Eastern Europe with Governor Clements and our first stop was Budapest.

03:26.733 --> 03:33.799
And like lots of the European airports, you taxi up and then the bus comes out and picks you up.

03:35.721 --> 03:48.071
So I'm standing in the bus with a hand on the bar, and this very European-looking man says, are you an Aggie?

03:49.512 --> 03:50.933
I mean, he's dressed in tweeds.

03:50.953 --> 03:52.054
He's got a tweed hat.

03:52.475 --> 03:53.636
He's got a mustache.

03:53.696 --> 03:56.638
In those days, he still didn't have many mustaches.

03:57.648 --> 03:59.750
It just shocked me.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.914
So I said yes and introduced myself.

04:05.055 --> 04:15.784
Turned out that he was an Austrian who somehow got into the US Army and came to A&M on the GI Bill.

04:17.506 --> 04:27.435
And his wife was Hungarian and she taught the Modern Language Department and her claim to fame was that she was the only woman

04:27.871 --> 04:29.854
who marched in Earl Rudder's inaugural.

04:32.737 --> 04:37.183
Anyway, we meet in Budapest, Hungary.

04:37.203 --> 04:40.628
Then in losing it, we were in the Dominican Republic.

04:41.890 --> 04:49.660
And I've always had a bad habit of washing my hands, take off a ring, and leave it on the laboratory.

04:51.614 --> 04:58.742
Well, it disappeared, and to this day you're not sure what happened.

04:59.423 --> 05:05.649
I'll accuse Carolyn of playing with it and dropping it in the commode, but I don't know.

05:05.669 --> 05:06.510
So this is a new one.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.514
So that's a new one.

05:09.534 --> 05:10.275
That's about the 30th.

05:10.295 --> 05:11.035
No, there's two.

05:11.055 --> 05:19.765
When I asked Dr. Bowen in his student day interview, he said he was a Cal Tech graduate student.

05:20.892 --> 05:24.798
on the train, he spent a semester or so at Heidelberg.

05:25.899 --> 05:32.569
He's on the train going across the Alps to Venice with two German graduate students.

05:32.589 --> 05:42.263
And this well-dressed lady, mature lady, is reading the paper, sitting across from him, and she looks over and said, oh, are you from Texas A&M?

05:42.864 --> 05:43.405
Yes, ma'am.

05:43.485 --> 05:45.668
How did you know?

05:46.660 --> 05:51.826
Well, I'm from the United States and my husband went to A&M.

05:52.066 --> 05:52.487
Oh really?

05:53.048 --> 05:54.529
Yes, you might have heard of him.

05:54.569 --> 05:55.591
His name is H.B.

05:55.611 --> 05:56.412
Zachary.

05:56.612 --> 05:58.114
Oh my goodness.

05:58.134 --> 06:00.316
And he said even as a student he knew H.B.

06:00.336 --> 06:01.177
Zachary was.

06:04.041 --> 06:11.790
Well, final review, the final final review, what was special about it?

06:16.225 --> 06:22.275
being through, finishing, all behind us.

06:22.435 --> 06:27.643
And that was the day we'd worked so hard to achieve.

06:28.064 --> 06:31.910
How well prepared did you feel you were for the future?

06:33.954 --> 06:35.156
I thought I was well prepared.

06:36.398 --> 06:40.444
As I say, having come through the Corps experience,

06:41.774 --> 06:45.939
I thought I could take anything or survive anything.

06:46.981 --> 06:48.843
And mom and dad were here.

06:48.923 --> 06:51.206
Who else was special for commencement?

06:51.707 --> 06:55.232
My brother and grandma.

06:55.412 --> 06:56.373
My grandmother came too.

06:58.115 --> 06:59.517
And commencement was held where?

07:00.298 --> 07:00.799
Gun Hall.

07:02.061 --> 07:05.385
Was there a special unforgettable speaker?

07:09.010 --> 07:11.132
Martin Bradley spoke at commissioning.

07:11.372 --> 07:15.036
I'd forgotten who the commencement speaker was.

07:16.398 --> 07:22.003
And every name called, diplomas were handed out?

07:22.023 --> 07:24.386
Oh yeah, just like it.

07:24.666 --> 07:30.933
It was supposed to have been held in Kyle Field with the rain.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.279
What creates Aggie spirit?

07:39.925 --> 07:41.447
I guess a shared experience.

07:43.049 --> 07:45.192
What experiences?

07:45.753 --> 07:53.423
Well, coming to an isolated place like this, a relatively isolated, particularly in those days it was isolated.

07:53.904 --> 07:59.291
What are the key events that are most significant to that experience?

08:02.816 --> 08:03.837
Well, I don't know today.

08:04.378 --> 08:05.319
No, no, but for you.

08:05.479 --> 08:09.645
But in my experience it was that core experience.

08:09.862 --> 08:20.395
the tough times, the difficult times, and yet knowing that I wasn't going to give up.

08:21.708 --> 08:25.355
that they couldn't do anything to me that would make me leave.

08:26.336 --> 08:33.049
As I say, it just showed me that I had to enter resources to survive anything after that.

08:34.171 --> 08:34.611
All right.

08:34.632 --> 08:42.045
Looking back, what did you learn at Texas A&M that has been important to you all your life?

08:49.501 --> 08:52.727
Well, I think leadership.

08:54.129 --> 09:05.449
The core experience in the military science classes were a dimension that other students didn't get.

09:07.533 --> 09:11.960
And I think that has stood me in good stead throughout.

09:13.082 --> 09:14.665
I think I got a good education.

09:15.792 --> 09:27.885
I won't say a superior one, but I think I got a very good education at the time in terms of what was available.

09:28.145 --> 09:31.409
Was that education theoretical or practical?

09:31.669 --> 09:31.930
Both.

09:33.391 --> 09:35.153
That's what I would have expected you to.

09:35.754 --> 09:42.441
And I think there are only

09:45.087 --> 09:52.417
Two or three professors I had that were, I don't consider being good professors.

09:52.437 --> 09:55.661
In other words, I think I've- Almost, you're saying, then almost every one of them.

09:56.162 --> 09:59.086
I think, as I say, I got a good education.

09:59.586 --> 10:07.898
I had professors who were good and who took an interest in their students.

10:07.918 --> 10:11.162
I mean, I think they were oriented towards students.

10:12.307 --> 10:15.751
If you wanted to chat with one of them, were they usually available?

10:15.992 --> 10:16.452
Oh, yes.

10:17.974 --> 10:19.055
See, that's my worry today.

10:19.596 --> 10:31.151
And they seemed to genuinely, I never had any feeling that I was imposing on them.

10:31.171 --> 10:31.471
All right.

10:31.491 --> 10:41.824
If you were a consultant to Texas A&M's leadership today, what advice would you give them about how they should guide A&M in the future?

10:47.052 --> 10:48.353
It's such a different world.

10:52.598 --> 10:52.858
I don't know.

10:52.878 --> 10:58.425
I don't know what.

10:58.445 --> 11:12.300
I think one thing that I did not appreciate as a student was the uniqueness of the land grant system.

11:15.132 --> 11:19.323
I think that's something that we're losing today, and I worry about it.

11:21.488 --> 11:31.133
These institutions were formed for a purpose, and that purpose is just as real today as it was when they were formed.

11:33.610 --> 11:53.776
I think, and I'm out of touch now, but when I did know, I think Michigan State made a tremendous mistake when they got some people in charge that tried to downplay their land grant status and make them just like another university.

11:55.699 --> 12:02.588
And so I think that's the biggest thing I would say today, is in looking at the future,

12:03.327 --> 12:26.448
Keep in mind and treasure this land-grant heritage that we've got, not to live in the past, but to look at that relationship between the university and the people and that obligation for service and a dedication to service.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.752
That's unique in the land-grant system.

12:32.048 --> 12:45.582
If someone walked up to you and handed you a check for a million dollars with one requirement, you must pass that on to Texas A&M, for what purpose would you want that gift used?

12:45.602 --> 13:00.958
In other words, if you had the capacity to make a truly big gift to A&M, what would you want that gift to do?

13:02.255 --> 13:18.076
I think we've got enough scholarship money, and I wouldn't feel that that would be a priority.

13:20.599 --> 13:30.051
My own feeling would probably be something in the area of

13:31.735 --> 13:39.082
understanding of science and what is good science and what is junk science.

13:40.363 --> 13:48.410
I think one of the biggest problems we've got today is we don't distinguish and we got too much junk science out there.

13:49.651 --> 13:59.160
With our land grant tradition, I think something to focus on this public policy issue would be terribly important.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.142
and significant.

14:01.162 --> 14:02.144
I don't see anybody doing it.

14:03.145 --> 14:11.337
This issue of global warming, I think is just full of junk science.

14:12.218 --> 14:16.485
And we can't, don't have any way of looking and getting it in perspective, a true perspective.

14:18.187 --> 14:23.595
So something in that area of trying to foster an understanding of what's good science

14:26.090 --> 14:39.988
As I look at the stuff you hear today in nutrition, for example, garbage, absolute garbage, and nobody is doing that.

14:40.089 --> 14:45.456
I think there ought to be a course in nutrition in the curriculum.

14:45.476 --> 14:49.721
Everybody needs to know some fundamentals of human nutrition.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.987
That's just an example of the junk science that we're

14:55.435 --> 15:04.298
bombarded with today, so something in the area of public policy and dealing with an understanding of science in today's world.

15:06.472 --> 15:09.256
I've got only two more questions.

15:11.659 --> 15:16.306
We'll do one of them and then I'll stop and ask what have we not covered that we should have.

15:17.527 --> 15:31.146
To what former Aggies, and that can mean former students, students, faculty, staff, friends, do you feel most indebted, most grateful?

15:34.332 --> 15:36.134
Looking at now from your student years.

15:36.515 --> 15:37.596
Oh, from my student years?

15:40.439 --> 15:42.021
Well, faculty, obviously.

15:42.362 --> 15:44.424
No, but what individuals?

15:46.407 --> 15:52.614
Well, I mentioned Joe Campbell, Dr. Morgan, S.S.

15:52.634 --> 15:59.142
Morgan, a professor of English, Dr. Mayo.

16:04.657 --> 16:07.440
As I say, George Robertson made such an impression.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.043
I'm in the importance of writing, clearly.

16:14.547 --> 16:16.409
Just any number of people.

16:17.390 --> 16:33.246
Spike White, Mr. Cashin, these people that took an interest in me as a person, as a lonely little student, encouraged me.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.089
I'm sure there are more.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.156
What have we left out?

16:41.176 --> 16:44.140
What topics that we should have from your student leaders?

16:44.160 --> 16:45.262
Oh, there's so much to do.

16:45.282 --> 16:50.350
I wish I could remember his name.

16:50.370 --> 17:03.891
I had a, I've forgotten now whether it was in the economics department or the history department, but it was an economic history course.

17:07.128 --> 17:12.273
I think it may have been in economics, but it was one of the best courses I had.

17:13.674 --> 17:19.139
It opened my eyes and I saw history in a different light.

17:20.641 --> 17:21.842
Can't think of his name now.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.767
Anyway, there are others that I could pull out.

17:29.629 --> 17:30.250
All right.

17:30.270 --> 17:36.055
Then the last question that I have is what feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M today?

17:38.954 --> 17:41.737
Very strong feelings.

17:45.340 --> 17:48.744
I still think it's a tremendous institution.

17:49.124 --> 18:03.679
It's a unique kind of an institution, as I say, and has been so important to this state and can be so important in the future.

18:05.009 --> 18:21.921
I don't know whether you remember what Dolph Briscoe told me when he was leaving the governor's office, and he said, one of my biggest regrets is that I didn't make more use of the NM services.

18:23.707 --> 18:27.173
and that stuck with me.

18:28.836 --> 18:35.187
I told Bill Clements that the first time I met him and said, I don't want you to leave office saying that.

18:36.068 --> 18:39.454
You'll remember he came over, spent a day with us,

18:41.223 --> 18:47.050
and impressed me so when he pulled out that little pad and started taking notes.

18:48.332 --> 18:55.561
Then when we had a press conference at the end, I started asking him questions.

18:55.581 --> 18:58.705
He just pulled that out and started reading back his notes.

19:00.588 --> 19:03.591
So, you know, that to me puts A&M in perspective.

19:03.611 --> 19:07.256
It's a special kind of institution.

19:07.456 --> 19:09.559
And I'm tremendously proud of it.
