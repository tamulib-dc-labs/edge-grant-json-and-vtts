WEBVTT

00:01.685 --> 00:07.812
Okay.

00:07.872 --> 00:08.913
You ready? Yeah. Okay. Morning, Chief Luther. As 
you know, this morning I'm going to ask you a few

00:12.056 --> 00:16.461
questions about the community. Yes, sir. And just 
answer any way you want to. Okay. The first

00:21.566 --> 00:27.252
question will be, Chief Luther, when and where 
were you born? In Frost, actually, September 4,

00:27.413 --> 00:30.696
1916. Okay, what about... That's a small 
community in, uh, Navarre County, near Corse

00:31.317 --> 00:36.527
County. In Corse County. Mm-hmm. Okay, and did 
your family live there long? Yes, uh-huh, for, um,

00:41.156 --> 00:49.271
some, uh, 50, 50 years. 50 to 60 years. Mm-hmm. 
Okay, and where did you receive your early

00:51.820 --> 00:55.645
schooling? At Forster County High School.

01:01.211 --> 01:04.916
Forster County High School, and like I said, 
junior high? Junior high, elementary, junior

01:04.936 --> 01:06.878
high, and then junior high. Junior high, okay. 
What were your plans after graduation? Did you

01:12.225 --> 01:19.093
have some kind of degree, or excuse me, I mean some 
kind of career in mind after graduating? Not

01:19.411 --> 01:21.053
necessarily. My ambition at that particular time 
was becoming a professional baseball player,

01:21.234 --> 01:36.835
which I had a bright chance of

01:21.234 --> 01:36.835
playing in the Class B league with Tyler Texas. 
Yes, I see. Is that pro? Pro, yes, sir. I mean, you

01:43.645 --> 01:48.692
could go straight from high school to pro without 
going to college. Yes, I see. Okay. Do you have

01:50.520 --> 01:53.004
anything else in mind? Or is that just the 
overwhelming ambition? Yes, that was my main

01:56.611 --> 01:59.195
ambition. And my second ambition was to be a member 
of the Department of Public Safety. Okay. Now

02:07.890 --> 02:09.413
we'll get on to the College Station. When and what 
brought you first to the College Station in Bryan

02:10.194 --> 02:14.562
area? In 1942, I was employed by the DPS as a Texas 
Highway Patrolman. First station was in Waco.

02:25.157 --> 02:31.844
There until March of 1944, went into service, U.S. 
Navy. Spent two years with this charge in March of

02:31.864 --> 02:43.317
1946,

02:31.864 --> 02:43.317
at which time I was reinstated as a Texas Highway 
Patrolman and sent to Bryce. So you came out of the

02:45.440 --> 02:53.111
Navy and went back into the DPS and you were 
assigned here at College Station. Yes, assigned

02:53.131 --> 02:57.938
to Bryan Station, Bryan College Station 
Community. Was that during World War II? That was

02:59.720 --> 03:01.663
after World War II. So the two years you served was 
during World War II? During World War II, yes. Do

03:06.610 --> 03:08.993
you remember what year this was? 1944, 1945. Okay. 
Now, what are your earliest memories of this area

03:11.798 --> 03:17.465
as you came back? A community-like city. Bryan, at 
that time, had a population of some 13,000, 13,500

03:24.435 --> 03:32.986
people. And at that particular time, College 
Station had a population of some 35,000 to 37,000.

03:43.135 --> 03:49.303
Was it densely populated? No, sir. Was it flat 
plains here? Yes. There we go. As a matter of fact,

03:55.770 --> 04:04.101
Texas Avenue, that took the time to clean Brian and 
College Station. It was an 18-foot slab with a

04:04.121 --> 04:07.405
gravel trail. I see. I'm I'm just I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm

04:10.000 --> 04:38.691
I'm

04:10.000 --> 04:38.691
I'm

04:10.000 --> 04:38.691
I'm I'm I'm I'm I didn't realize it was that 
distance in between them. Okay.

04:52.078 --> 04:57.546
Now, where was the major part of College Station 
located when you came here? I'm not sure, you know,

04:58.167 --> 04:59.890
where it was. I was wondering if it was located in 
one particular section or was it surrounding? The

05:06.701 --> 05:09.505
North Gate was the major part. Then everything was 
located on North Dade? Generally, yes sir. I

05:18.852 --> 05:28.744
thought there might have been an old section over 
here on the South Dade side.

05:28.764 --> 05:34.350
That was partially populated on the South side at 
that time.

05:34.370 --> 05:37.214
You're talking about the old Hardwick? It was a 
place. Oh, there

05:37.683 --> 05:46.738
was nightclubs over there? I see. And there was 
just a very few houses and most of everything was

05:46.938 --> 05:59.158
located over here at Northgate. Most of the 
business was there. As a matter of fact, there was a

06:00.921 --> 06:04.787
few business establishments over on Texas 
Avenue. Jones Pharmacy is the one that I remember

06:05.273 --> 06:13.463
rewetting. Was there anything back here on the 
east side, you know, like across the tracks? Did

06:19.491 --> 06:21.474
the school take up all the way to the tracks? To the 
tracks. Was there anything on the other side?

06:27.201 --> 06:29.644
They've got some buildings over there now.

06:33.218 --> 06:38.926
Uh, the old cattle farm, right? Yes,

06:38.946 --> 06:43.333
sir. And, uh, and dairy farm. Uh-huh. I see. Okay. 
Um, uh, this is probably a little bit, maybe a

06:48.821 --> 06:54.490
little tougher of a question. Uh, since then, how 
has the area expanded? Which way has it, which way

06:56.873 --> 06:59.016
has it gone? It's gone in all directions. Yes, sir. 
Both, uh, the City of Bryan and Copper State. Yes,

07:02.541 --> 07:02.922
sir. It didn't really matter,

07:03.104 --> 07:15.741
just the whole

07:03.104 --> 07:15.741
thing exploded? Yes, just exploded. In all 
directions. Which way do you think it came to that?

07:22.189 --> 07:22.610
That's a hard answer. It appears that Bryan, 
perhaps, will have to go east, and perhaps College

07:22.630 --> 07:26.054
Station. College Station will have to go east, or 
south of east.

07:34.627 --> 07:54.029
You

07:34.627 --> 07:54.029
have

07:34.627 --> 07:54.029
me know if College

07:34.627 --> 07:54.029
Station and Bryan people have always got along 
together good? Yes, very well as far as I know. work

08:00.378 --> 08:02.380
together and projects. Yes, coordinated all of 
that. Are there any, to your knowledge, are there

08:06.926 --> 08:13.234
any parades that have been going on? Year after 
year, it's kind of like an annual celebration?

08:20.984 --> 08:22.926
Yes, the Christmas parade is an annual 
celebration, and that's on November. And when

08:27.925 --> 08:30.528
does that take place? Usually around the first of 
December. First

08:39.502 --> 08:43.528
of December.

08:46.372 --> 08:46.792
And who participates? Both College Station and 
Bryan, and some of the surrounding communities.

08:49.817 --> 08:52.761
Can you remember anyone in particular that was 
kind of and uh...

08:53.045 --> 09:20.301
they have a

09:21.007 --> 09:22.589
Okay. Let's

09:22.609 --> 09:26.795
turn to farming. This area is a lot of farming, 
concerned with the farming lot. Can you tell me,

09:35.908 --> 09:43.940
has there been, to the best of your knowledge, any 
changes in farming, the way they do farming, the

09:35.908 --> 09:43.940
tools? Yes, it's become mechanized. Can you tell 
me about that this year? Yes,

09:48.530 --> 10:14.335
when

09:48.530 --> 10:14.335
I first came to Brian, it was not uncommon to see 
mules and horses used in cultivating the land in

09:48.530 --> 10:14.335
the private river bottom, but now it's all 
mechanized and tractors and mechanical

09:48.530 --> 10:14.335
equipment, and that's definitely some of the 
tractors they're using, atro-stock, or when

09:48.530 --> 10:14.335
they're using the mules. What was that saying? 
uh...

10:15.158 --> 10:44.507
eight-year-old

10:15.158 --> 10:44.507
rather than

10:15.158 --> 10:44.507
too so

10:15.158 --> 10:44.507
they uh... techniques other than increasing the 
amount of area they can form at one time? Like crop

10:52.652 --> 10:59.421
rotation, like

10:52.652 --> 10:59.421
using big tractors. Remember the ones with the air 
conditioning they've got now? Yes, uh-huh. Are

11:06.570 --> 11:07.551
there any other techniques? None that I know of. I 
think it's more or less a seasonal type. Those

11:10.643 --> 11:35.528
two

11:10.643 --> 11:35.528
crops have always

11:10.643 --> 11:35.528
been major? Yes. Would you happen to know when 
irrigation became

11:37.542 --> 11:53.819
widely

11:37.542 --> 11:53.819
used in this

11:37.542 --> 11:53.819
area? I think perhaps

11:54.459 --> 12:01.887
in about 1957 or long about that period. Is there 
anything that made it mandatory then or it's just

12:01.907 --> 12:04.229
what caused it to come in? I think the farmers at 
that time, I don't know, in 50, maybe 55,

12:10.094 --> 12:32.402
Okay,

12:10.094 --> 12:32.402
now

12:10.094 --> 12:32.402
I guess everybody, all the farmers in the area 
generally went

12:10.094 --> 12:32.402
to it automatically. Yes. Okay, please describe, 
if you would, what forms of recreation everyone

12:37.820 --> 13:07.320
july first-year

12:37.820 --> 13:07.320
yes

12:37.820 --> 13:07.320
anything that everybody

12:37.820 --> 13:07.320
else here

13:09.629 --> 13:13.635
You know, a lot of people like to go out to 
Somerville. Well, of course,

13:13.995 --> 13:25.871
yes, but there was an old facility

13:13.995 --> 13:25.871
at Somerville in 1964, or by 1964. Is that a, I'm 
sorry, I probably heard, is that a, A man-made

13:31.364 --> 13:32.486
lake? A man-made.

13:39.340 --> 13:45.132
When was it made?

13:45.152 --> 13:48.558
Let me clarify that.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.364
You mean by man-made, of course, it was the 
construction of the dam up in the middle of the land

13:48.578 --> 13:51.364
in the Yehaw Creek area.

13:59.090 --> 14:06.139
So

13:59.090 --> 14:06.139
it wouldn't be until 1964 that it would be used? 
That's right. Okay. Was there anything else that

14:07.181 --> 14:11.166
everyone liked to do? Was there a few bars or 
something? Oh yes, there were quite a few bars and a

14:15.772 --> 14:19.056
nightclub. Oh, a rink, I see.

14:27.851 --> 14:40.209
Was it the same one that's located

14:27.851 --> 14:40.209
over

14:27.851 --> 14:40.209
there? No, this one was located on Highway 21, some 
mile after mile after mile. Where did everybody

14:45.057 --> 14:51.063
seem to go on Friday afternoons? For us, Friday 
afternoon we may go to Somerville. On a particular

14:55.227 --> 14:59.892
night we may go to Lakeview. Is there any 
particular place that everybody seemed to really

14:59.992 --> 15:09.602
enjoy and stood out

14:59.992 --> 15:09.602
in everybody's mind? Oh, man, I can't think of any. 
One place. Okay.

15:21.035 --> 15:28.914
Where

15:21.035 --> 15:28.914
did you like to go? Did you have one particular 
place that you enjoyed? During the weekends, we

15:35.430 --> 15:38.217
would go to the night owls. Friday,

15:40.407 --> 15:59.121
Saturday, and Sunday, so I didn't have an 
opportunity to visit or go to too many places. You

15:59.141 --> 15:59.943
were off probably during the week. Yeah, one day a 
week. I'd usually be on Wednesday. And then we

16:00.984 --> 16:02.327
would start to get to college during the day off. 
And I spent many hours working in the day.

16:06.952 --> 16:21.649
Did you start playing

16:06.952 --> 16:21.649
in the College Station area? College Station, 
yeah. You would never get caught outside of the

16:23.050 --> 16:25.813
area? Oh, yes. We had an area assigned to us. At that 
time, we patrolled from Bryan to the Paris County

16:28.276 --> 16:32.561
CBX and Highway 6 and Highway 2 Main. We had all the 
Bunnison County. We had all the Robertson County

16:33.582 --> 16:36.165
and all the Madison County.

16:39.554 --> 16:47.924
Three

16:39.554 --> 16:47.924
or fifty

16:39.554 --> 16:47.924
weeks? Three. Wouldn't be the same way as that? No. 
Now they have some twelve uniformed police

16:56.033 --> 17:03.202
officers, DPS officers stationed in this area. 
And three or four in Kyle, and three or four in

17:03.222 --> 17:08.548
Hearn, and the same number in Madisonville, and 
about the same number in Madisonville and

17:03.222 --> 17:08.548
Hicksville. Were there any local police in those 
areas that you had gone? Yes, very few. Very few.

17:18.696 --> 17:24.984
When I first formed Brian, the senior college 
station had one police force. And Brian had some

17:25.004 --> 17:33.574
total of seven or eight, not more than ten. My 
goodness. Was there enough crime to keep

17:39.701 --> 17:54.783
them busy, or did they need more people but they 
couldn't get them, or was it just a quiet time?

17:54.803 --> 17:55.665
Well, they were always needing more people. I 
mean, it's a real-ass community. It's not too

17:57.768 --> 17:58.329
incriminating. Okay. Then, traffic

17:58.883 --> 18:20.514
was a major

17:58.883 --> 18:20.514
problem. How was the traffic in the first county? 
Well, when I first came to Bride, in Bride's

18:22.997 --> 18:27.183
County, the year of 1946, there were 14,000 
people. Now, we have some 48,000 people. I'm sure

18:28.398 --> 18:56.768
I'm

18:28.398 --> 18:56.768
not real sure about

18:28.398 --> 18:56.768
things

18:28.398 --> 18:56.768
weren't all

18:28.398 --> 18:56.768
the roads paved No.

19:01.463 --> 19:10.034
We had the old farm

19:01.463 --> 19:10.034
16... What is that?

19:13.419 --> 19:13.939
1688. It was out of paid road. We had a farm that was 
out of road. and north of

19:27.595 --> 19:42.207
Bryan, and northwest

19:27.595 --> 19:42.207
of Bryan, but that's not a paved road. And that's 
the only thing that was paved in the way that that

19:42.227 --> 19:51.615
took the time. Even the old San Antonio OS office, I 
think that was, was not all paved. And about the

19:54.017 --> 19:57.400
only paved roads that I can remember are Highway 6 
and Highway 9. Uh, I was just thinking about

19:59.675 --> 20:03.140
lights. When did they put

20:03.540 --> 20:10.730
up the traffic lights? They haven't always been 
there. They were always up there. No, it is. The

20:17.380 --> 20:21.466
lights between, uh, uh, Bryan and, uh, Tyler's 
Station have been recently installed. I don't

20:21.486 --> 20:22.407
remember what it was called. Uh... That's been 
very recent. Before then, it was, what, just, you

20:27.890 --> 20:38.250
just came to a turn and stopped? Yeah, stopped, 
stopped. Stopped? Stopped. It's been traffics,

20:39.653 --> 20:43.781
or was it traffic accidents that made you 
concerned right then before the lights went off?

20:43.801 --> 20:43.941
Mm-hmm.

20:53.270 --> 21:11.952
Can

20:53.270 --> 21:11.952
you recall any natural disasters such as floods or 
droughts or even epidemics that have hit this area

20:53.270 --> 21:11.952
since you've been here? No epidemics, but I can 
remember two floods. I believe one in 1907, the

21:15.757 --> 21:23.226
rise of the river, and then in 1965, I believe. Was 
it a hurricane, or was it weather coming from the

21:24.100 --> 21:30.529
north? Yeah, just heavy rainfall in the North 
Texas area, around Waco, Clifton, and the areas of

21:30.549 --> 21:49.096
the general area of the Brighton River, or the 
watershed that goes into the Brighton River. Oh, I

21:49.296 --> 21:49.797
see. It rained up north and flowed downstream to us 
here and flooded us through. Of course, with heavy

21:54.290 --> 22:12.686
rains here also, rivers, the Navasota River, 
would have contributed in the fact, you know, big

21:54.290 --> 22:12.686
rains around the head, and the rains in general, 
big rains in general, over central. And you can

22:12.706 --> 22:16.112
only remember about two little areas. That's all 
that I can remember of. Yes,

22:17.527 --> 22:22.694
sir. Okay, how about grouse?

22:35.792 --> 22:39.037
Well, the one I believe in 57 that I mentioned a 
while ago, I think that can be considered a grouse.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.238
How long did that last? Do you remember? About a 
year. It lasted a whole year. Well, not

22:41.961 --> 22:47.348
necessarily, but not enough rainfall during that 
period to break it. How did that affect the

22:47.564 --> 22:53.370
farmers? Did they all go bankrupt? Did they sue its 
crops? No. They brought out the irrigation. They

23:03.141 --> 23:12.031
brought out the irrigation and perhaps had a 
little money to, or borrowed money to take care of

23:03.141 --> 23:12.031
it. They lost

23:12.051 --> 23:16.035
it for about 50 years. Are there any legends or tall 
tales about this area? Where I'm from, you might

23:23.907 --> 23:28.312
hear a few tall tales about the woods. And I was just 
wondering if there's any legends or tall tales

23:28.973 --> 23:34.499
about this area. There might not. I'm sure there 
are, but I don't know. Okay. Now, looking back over

23:43.389 --> 23:48.655
the years that you've been here, have the people 
changed much? Not a great figure. They were the

23:56.102 --> 24:10.237
back

23:56.102 --> 24:10.237
end

23:56.102 --> 24:10.237
that was in the community. That's true. Were they 
more aggressive? Framelier or anything like

24:12.479 --> 24:14.281
that? No, I don't think so. This is always, in my 
opinion, the real framer community. Both Brian

24:17.264 --> 24:18.085
and Polly What

24:19.111 --> 24:29.182
is it about College Station that has kept you here? 
It couldn't be just a job, as you've already said.

24:32.265 --> 24:34.888
You really like it. Yes. Well, we mentioned the 
good people and the idea of ladies. And my primary

24:45.925 --> 25:09.013
purpose when I first came to Bryan and the college 
basement for me to stay was that I had two sons who I

24:45.925 --> 25:09.013
wanted one day to graduate from A&M University. Of 
course, at that time it was Texas A&M College.

25:17.228 --> 25:36.071
That was my comfortable

25:17.228 --> 25:36.071
reason for staying in this family for thirty years 
without me. Did both sons finally go to Texas A&M?

25:39.234 --> 25:41.277
Yes, my oldest son left for four years and passed 
for a device. Then he came to the University of, I

25:41.297 --> 25:44.721
don't know, the University of and

25:44.920 --> 26:07.975
graduated from Harvard in 1967. Oh my goodness, 
you know all of them. Yeah, and my young son, Gene,

26:10.158 --> 26:11.320
attended Allen Academy, too. Then, one year at 
A&M, and then classed for the Pan American

26:11.340 --> 26:13.122
University Baseball College. Mm-hmm, I see.

26:17.692 --> 26:32.187
What

26:17.692 --> 26:32.187
is it that's

26:17.692 --> 26:32.187
keeping you here now today? Did you put your roots 
here for thirty years and they're not often ready?

26:40.495 --> 26:41.136
That's true. It's the same thing. It's the 
community in mind. And the people that

26:42.137 --> 26:46.922
I know and my good friends and... Still in

26:47.223 --> 27:11.633
law enforcement,

26:47.223 --> 27:11.633
so to speak, it's the plus 100% cooperation that we 
get, or this department gets, from the Department

26:47.223 --> 27:11.633
of Public Safety, the Goddard Station PD, the 
Brown PD, and the Brown Sheriff Department. But as

27:11.653 --> 27:13.095
a matter of fact, all law enforcement agencies, 
all over,

27:16.838 --> 27:37.805
Is that usually the general consensus of people 
that you've met passing through, that they've

27:16.838 --> 27:37.805
been surprised and happy about College

27:16.838 --> 27:37.805
Station being such a nice place? Yes. Okay. Chief 
Luther, I'd like to thank you very much for giving

27:39.327 --> 27:45.014
me this time to interview you. I've enjoyed it and 
learned a great deal. Thank you, sir. I've enjoyed

27:47.848 --> 27:48.912
it very much. Appreciate you coming by. Yes, sir. I 
hope I've done a halfway decent job.
