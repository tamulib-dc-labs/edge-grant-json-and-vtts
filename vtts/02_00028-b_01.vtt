00:02.630 --> 00:07.555
So we'd drag it into the middle of her bridge party 
or her D.A.R. ladies luncheon or whatever and

00:07.575 --> 00:10.758
she'd just go berserk. And then he decided that he 
was going, he thought armadillos were really

00:11.919 --> 00:20.227
strange creatures. And he was of the mind that, you 
know, everything could be eaten, squirrels,

00:21.669 --> 00:30.898
rabbits, so we needed to eat an armadillo. And so, I 
don't know where we were. I may have been at

00:34.866 --> 00:37.489
tutoring or I don't know. But we came home one day 
and he was the only one who was home. And the picnic

00:42.635 --> 00:45.178
table was covered with blood. And he had caught an 
armadillo and killed it and then de-shelled it and

00:45.218 --> 01:00.497
put it, taken it into the kitchen and put it into big 
old roasting pan and put all this garbage on it and

01:02.063 --> 01:26.974
stuck it in the oven for our dinner that night he was 
gonna try an armadillo yeah he was he was gonna try

01:02.063 --> 01:26.974
an armadillo overall that's what they used to call 
him right and then he was very brave i learned to

01:02.063 --> 01:26.974
drive with him and this was when he was late 70s And 
I'd run into ditches, and he just wouldn't say a

01:28.675 --> 01:33.399
whole lot. He was a neat guy. So you were very 
fortunate from a standpoint, because you grew up

01:37.363 --> 01:45.790
with kind of an extended family around you then,

01:37.363 --> 01:45.790
didn't you? Yeah. I think that's what a lot of 
people miss today. Yes, I think so, too. And I think

01:51.736 --> 01:56.460
they miss a lot of values as a result of a lot of that. 
I do, too. I grew up the same way, with an extended

01:56.700 --> 01:58.682
family There's 14 in my mother's family, and they 
were together constantly, all the time. Almost

02:04.256 --> 02:06.759
every Sunday there was a group of them together. 
And then on my dad's side, it was the same way. There

02:09.403 --> 02:11.306
was a group of them that were together. So we're one 
of the two places where both sides were there at the

02:11.346 --> 02:15.572
house all the time. It was a lot of fun going. And now 
no one has time for anybody. That's the problem.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.763
Yeah, that's right. I mean it was a big deal then to 
make ice cream on Saturday night. I mean they'd

02:28.628 --> 02:34.421
come far and wide to eat ice cream and shoot the bull 
and play dominoes. Right.
