00:02.461 --> 00:11.457
Now, uh, you know, along this line of government 
limitations upon on the development portion, was

00:02.461 --> 00:11.457
Sea Grant a good idea or a bad idea? Well, I—perhaps 
it's too early, really, to tell. There seems to be,

00:16.687 --> 00:23.760
uh, there seems to be no question about land grant 
as being beneficial, but probably three or four

00:25.276 --> 00:28.724
years after it started, it didn't look like it was 
going to be successful. But I can conceive of Sea

00:29.285 --> 00:39.128
Grant being equally successful.

00:39.149 --> 00:43.639
In fact, I just finished a little small study, one 
that where I needed a couple months of work by

00:44.311 --> 00:49.078
somebody, and it funded that. Total amount, 
though, for a couple months of work, counting

00:49.378 --> 00:53.985
overhead and everything else, nothing for me. It 
was a couple thousand dollars, so it's not very...

00:54.646 --> 01:01.376
None of the government things seem very 
cost-effective. But at least a lot of things get

01:01.416 --> 01:08.506
done that are worthwhile, I think. I would think 
that in another ten years we can look back at Sea

01:08.526 --> 01:12.512
Grant and and see whether it's cost-effective or 
not, probably. There seems to be a move on the part

01:16.393 --> 01:24.722
of government to concentrate almost all funding 
agencies for oceanography under one central

01:16.393 --> 01:24.722
head. Probably the Department of Commerce. Do you 
favor that? No. It's the Russian system. The

01:31.230 --> 01:37.517
Russian system,

01:31.230 --> 01:37.517
funding is organized bureaucratically. And

01:38.178 --> 01:42.583
if you have a good idea, funding agency doesn't 
like it, you're dead. With several funding

01:49.883 --> 01:59.198
agencies, then you may find more people, somebody 
else who realizes this may be an important idea.

01:59.358 --> 02:02.903
I'd rather have several competitive. The 
congressmen tend to think that you should, for

02:02.923 --> 02:12.638
efficiency, have everything going out of one 
channel, but they haven't recognized that that

02:13.259 --> 02:18.544
they could do the same thing with automobiles, 
require only one automobile, no choice in that.

02:19.004 --> 02:21.947
And they fail to recognize that monopolies are not 
very efficient. Witness the post office, the rail

02:21.967 --> 02:33.858
transport,

02:21.967 --> 02:33.858
the Social Security, above all else, the TVA, you 
add them all up. They pay no taxes, but they're

02:33.938 --> 02:37.642
always getting their deficits filled. Okay. Now, 
the next several questions, the last several

02:40.004 --> 02:43.047
questions I have to ask you, concern really the 
environment and the ocean. What's your reaction

02:47.768 --> 02:51.833
to the environment movement? Soft-headed. The 
people who complain the most about the

02:54.757 --> 03:02.128
environment really don't think the problem 
through. They're against everything. I never

03:04.611 --> 03:07.635
hear them in favor of anything. For example, 
they're against oil. because of the oil spills.

03:13.228 --> 03:19.495
They're against the offshore drilling here, 
failing to recognize that the offshore drilling

03:13.228 --> 03:19.495
has very minor spills. In fact, to put it in a 
positive way, 99.98%

03:19.515 --> 03:32.351
of the oil that's produced offshore comes to shore 
in the pipeline. That's a pretty high efficiency,

03:32.371 --> 03:37.778
higher purity than ivory soap. In contrast, If it 
isn't produced offshore, it's brought in by

03:38.917 --> 03:44.885
tankers, and the losses are very much greater than 
tankers. The Argo merchant here spilled oil. He

03:46.987 --> 03:49.951
came from the Caribbean and came all the way up here 
to spill it. Saudi Arabia, oil was spilled at

03:49.971 --> 03:58.282
Cornwall in England, where oil will never be 
produced. So the environmentalists ought to be

03:58.542 --> 04:05.771
pushing for offshore drilling if they want to 
preserve their environment. The

04:05.792 --> 04:08.535
environmentalists are against burning coal and 
they're against strip mining. If they mine the

04:12.258 --> 04:23.414
coal from underground, their fatalities are 
orders in magnitude higher than the fatalities

04:12.258 --> 04:23.414
and injuries from strip mining.

04:26.278 --> 04:30.685
They object to the strip mining because it spoils 
the scenery. They've never, if you ask the

04:30.705 --> 04:37.915
environmentalists, they probably have never 
been out to Wyoming, Montana, in the remote areas

04:30.705 --> 04:37.915
where they... where the cold is the thickest and 
the overburden the thinnest. They're against

04:41.795 --> 04:43.037
nuclear energy. There are good reasons to be 
against nuclear energy, but there are good

04:45.100 --> 04:49.386
reasons to be against all of the other things. They 
are in favor of solar energy, but most of them don't

04:50.127 --> 05:02.164
know enough arithmetic or have enough interest in 
it to go through the necessary arithmetic to show

04:50.127 --> 05:02.164
that in no way is it cost-effective, several times 
more than any other source. They're in favor of

05:03.406 --> 05:06.130
wave power. Capital investment for wave power is 
so large that the interest on that exceeds the

05:07.358 --> 05:14.208
value of the energy it's got. Wave energy, of 
course, is the same thing. Thermal energy from the

05:16.472 --> 05:20.218
ocean isn't unknown. It doesn't look like it's 
very large. Wind power sounds fine, to go through

05:22.601 --> 05:25.466
the arithmetic. I want to put in a well in my 
backyard with a windmill on it. I find that... It

05:30.798 --> 05:36.304
would cost over $800 to make the well, at least $500 
for the windmill. I figure I can get the investment

05:36.725 --> 05:39.608
back in about several hundred years. These are 
things that the environmentalists just don't

05:40.769 --> 05:45.775
look at. Now, I don't know anything the 
environmentalists are for. They don't provide an

05:50.280 --> 05:54.504
alternative, and that's important.

05:54.905 --> 05:57.868
Can't get away from the automobile and go to horse 
and buggy days. A horse requires an acre of land to

05:58.355 --> 06:02.039
be fed. There's not that many acres to take out of 
production for things that the humans need to feed

06:02.319 --> 06:11.509
the horses to the equivalent power. I'm sorry it's 
that way. I wish the environmentalists were more

06:13.552 --> 06:19.878
knowledgeable so that they could be a help instead 
of a problem. They're part of the problem. And

06:21.801 --> 06:27.026
there seems to be no way of changing them. Mostly 
they're I guess many of them are sociologists or

06:28.139 --> 06:32.405
type-oriented. Maybe they're doing the term 
papers or something, but they don't know. They

06:36.752 --> 06:39.636
don't try to go through the arithmetic 
themselves. That's my opinion. Then the issue of

06:42.401 --> 06:49.511
ocean pollution, since you've always been 
involved in sediments and those kinds of things,

06:42.401 --> 06:49.511
do you consider that dangerous? No. The only place 
where the pollution... as dangerous as in

06:53.958 --> 07:00.605
enclosed bays, such as Buzzards Bay here, the oil 
spill is here, or in some other bays. In fact, there

07:00.945 --> 07:04.829
are lots of bays in Louisiana, as you know. But the 
damage from attributed oil spill there is

07:04.849 --> 07:10.794
negligible compared to the damage from a 
hurricane. Absolutely negligible. The oil

07:15.339 --> 07:21.585
that's lost in the ocean every year is so small it'd 
make a layer eight one-thousandths of a micron

07:15.339 --> 07:21.585
thick. if it were spreading that is not spreading 
if you took all the oil that exists that hasn't been

07:21.920 --> 07:47.623
recovered the estimated resources anyway and 
dumped it on the ocean all it wanted to make a layer

07:21.920 --> 07:47.623
one millimeter thick there's no way the ocean is 
going to be changed into an ocean of oil no way now to

07:21.920 --> 07:47.623
carry this a little bit farther i saw when i'm out to 
sea i look for tar balls and have the The crew,

07:47.958 --> 07:52.069
helmsmen, people on the bridge also keep a record. 
They don't find enough to bother with, but we found

07:52.089 --> 07:58.086
a couple of them, and both of these are ones where 
Gulf Africa, that is. Both these are ones where I

08:02.388 --> 08:09.518
picked up a dip net to put some in a bucket to bring it 
back here to see whether it was tank washings or

08:02.388 --> 08:09.518
natural. It turned out to be tank washings. But the 
main thing of interest there is that all the little

08:10.839 --> 08:17.168
tar lumps are covered with or contained. The young 
tar lumps don't have much, but the older ones that

08:17.448 --> 08:26.580
are hard

08:17.448 --> 08:26.580
have hydroids and barnacles growing on them, 
other things. Eventually they make so much weight

08:27.061 --> 08:29.524
they make the thing sink. In addition, these 
tarballs, clusters of them, serve as shelter

08:30.415 --> 08:49.318
for little triggerfish that are the same size and 
shape and color as the tarballs, much like

08:30.415 --> 08:49.318
sargassum fish hides under sargassum. 
Triggerfish I didn't think was a deep-sea fish,

08:49.338 --> 08:55.445
but here they're taking advantage of an 
opportunity. So it seems clear.

09:00.520 --> 09:07.309
that there's a good possibility that the tar balls 
have increased the biomass of the ocean instead of

09:00.520 --> 09:07.309
decreased it. Now, the tar and the oil is an organic 
product. One can think of it as organic matter, a

09:11.754 --> 09:17.982
return to organic matter, food for the bacteria. 
Zobel's whole life work has been learning that

09:18.523 --> 09:29.717
bacteria can destroy,

09:18.523 --> 09:29.717
can destroy, he's credited for finding how 
bacteria help make oil, but that's not the case.

09:33.332 --> 09:35.595
Mostly it's how it destroys them. Now,

09:35.615 --> 09:44.288
this means that...

09:44.308 --> 09:46.792
It's getting worse, I guess. This means, of 
course, that the bacteria, a little oil may be very

09:47.172 --> 09:57.688
helpful, may be desirable for the bacteria or the 
organisms. You can have too much.

10:01.507 --> 10:06.715
Even oxygen is a pollutant when it's too abundant. 
It kills the animal too much, if you have too much

10:06.735 --> 10:10.801
oxygen. Trace metals that are present in it are 
considered very bad, but on the other hand, trace

10:11.602 --> 10:22.738
metals are necessary for agriculture on land, 
probably also on the ocean. The bad oil spills have

10:24.676 --> 10:29.443
been those with refined oil, refined oil, heavy 
oil. It doesn't evaporate very fast. Whereas

10:31.727 --> 10:35.793
crude oil, 3 quarters of it evaporates in two or 
three days. The ones confined in marshes and so

10:38.016 --> 10:45.848
forth, then of course, it is picked up by various 
animals in the marsh. And the presence of trace

10:46.389 --> 10:48.152
elements, of course, Some of the trace elements 
are considered carcinogens, because a rat fed on

10:48.841 --> 10:58.330
them will die if he gets on a foot, for example. 
Extrapolating for the soft drink sweeteners,

10:59.351 --> 11:15.285
you'd be killed if you drank 300 bottles of Coke 
every day for the rest of your life. Not that thing.

11:17.022 --> 11:23.109
But there's a law that says if they exhibit any cars 
to affect them, they should be banned. In fact, the

11:23.129 --> 11:30.619
same bureau says give standards for discharge of 
water to the ocean. You're not allowed to let the

11:30.639 --> 11:37.827
Mississippi River discharge the ocean.

11:38.608 --> 11:40.410
Is there anything else you'd like to add to the 
tape? No, I don't think so. Okay. I thank you then.
