00:05.617 --> 00:14.807
An organization with those words as its title has 
been working with great energy and success for a

00:05.617 --> 00:14.807
number of years.

00:20.013 --> 00:20.434
And thus. We have been trying to make this the and I 
can't think of the name of the shrub. That's this is

00:27.542 --> 00:31.506
the capital of and I'll think of that later.

00:34.574 --> 00:53.651
And then for the last two years,

00:34.574 --> 00:53.651
generous souls have contributed about $25,000 
total to

00:34.574 --> 00:53.651
help us blanket the Brazos with wildflowers.

01:03.259 --> 01:03.940
Could we Post.

01:07.772 --> 01:08.433
Attractive. Welcoming welcome signs.

01:13.860 --> 01:14.180
Near. At the entry. Of our County on each of the 
highways.

01:23.252 --> 01:24.353
So that every. Visitor. Would know they were 
entering.

01:34.565 --> 01:35.947
An area that was. Truly proud. And convinced. Of 
the. Validity of that pride.

01:53.171 --> 01:54.813
Welcome to the hub of the Brazos.

01:57.477 --> 01:57.597
Or. To

01:57.657 --> 02:02.103
put. It in more.

02:06.020 --> 02:07.321
True Texas terms. To assure. Everyone who comes. 
To these. Acres. But this is a fine place. Much has

02:24.477 --> 02:26.019
been accomplished here. But because of the good 
effort. Faith and determination. Of thousands of

02:33.897 --> 02:35.879
individuals.

02:38.682 --> 02:41.885
From who have come here literally from all over the 
world. But it is good today.

02:48.732 --> 02:51.535
But in Texas wording. You ain't seen nothing yet. 
The best is yet to come. Thank you.

03:08.575 --> 03:11.681
The kind of tree I was trying to think of a while 
ago... The

03:11.701 --> 03:20.377
kind of tree I was trying to think of a while ago was 
crepe myrtle. The idea of being Brazos County and

03:21.800 --> 03:28.693
Bryan College Station as the crepe myrtle capital 
of Texas.
