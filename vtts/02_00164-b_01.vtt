WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:07.650
Of course, the corps commander, deputy 
commander, we did not interview his staff. And

00:08.051 --> 00:17.693
company commanders were interviewed by the 
respective service, but I sat in on some of those.

00:17.733 --> 00:21.702
But we only did the leadership jobs.

00:23.302 --> 00:29.331
Can you give some examples of the kinds of 
questions, the kinds of concerns y'all had? Well,

00:29.411 --> 00:46.035
we asked them the same sort of things you're 
asking, you know, what were their goals and what

00:29.411 --> 00:46.035
were they going to do about keeping the freshmen in 
the outfits and the attrition rate was one of the

00:29.411 --> 00:46.035
biggest problems we had and probably still have. 
because there was such a change in lifestyle to go

00:46.640 --> 00:54.510
from high school into the Corps of Cadets. And, you 
know, they need to understand that thoroughly and

00:54.530 --> 01:02.059
not try to run them, see how tough they are so they 
can run them off. And I think that was the biggest

01:02.880 --> 01:08.327
thing we worked up, and so did the Corps, for the 
most part, the Corps style. Do you remember any

01:09.117 --> 01:12.021
goofy answers that anybody gave? Any that were 
humorous? Oh, I really don't. I think they were

01:15.746 --> 01:18.109
pretty well brief before they came in. And about 
how long would these interviews last? Probably an

01:21.514 --> 01:22.495
hour. And that'd be in the spring? Yes, before 
they... I've forgotten when the... before the

01:31.507 --> 01:37.335
elephant walk came. And General Simpson, 
incidentally, started interviewing, took over

01:37.433 --> 01:46.332
the interview process after he'd gotten his feet 
on the ground, but in my office. Oh, did he come

01:47.595 --> 01:50.942
during your time? Yes. Oh, describe that. Well, 
one day, Dr. Williams called me and He says, this is

01:57.194 --> 01:58.776
on a Friday. Tom, I got great news. And I said, yes, 
sir. And what's that? And he said, we're going to

02:03.440 --> 02:05.803
get a Navy ROTC unit. I said, Dr. Williams, that's 
not such great news. He said, what do you mean? I

02:09.847 --> 02:13.250
said, well, I'm trying to get Army officers and the 
Air Force, Air Force. I don't want Navy Marines.

02:15.192 --> 02:17.114
And he kind of laughed and he said, well, you got 
them. And he says, I want you to come up here and I'm

02:17.755 --> 02:22.860
going to give you the application. And you know how 
it is. It was that fit. And I need it by Monday

02:26.000 --> 02:27.503
morning. And mind you, I don't have university 
staff. I had an Army officer that we worked all

02:32.070 --> 02:37.439
weekend, an Air Force officer, putting that thing 
together. And some of them had some skills on this

02:37.459 --> 02:43.389
job and were able to get the information out of the 
registrars and this, that, and the other. But it

02:43.830 --> 02:44.912
was a real process. Anyway, we met the deadline. As 
far as you know, who were the key people in getting

02:47.026 --> 02:52.612
that approved in Washington? General Simpson. 
Simpson? Yeah, sure. He was the chief of personnel

02:55.215 --> 02:59.319
for the Marine Corps. And I think Tiger Teague. 
Tiger was involved, yes. Congressman. Yes, but

03:05.326 --> 03:09.090
General Simpson was the motivator. Had you met him 
at the time of that application? I had not. When did

03:15.877 --> 03:16.898
you first meet him? Well, it was probably shortly 
after that. We had him down for a weekend football

03:20.649 --> 03:23.553
game. I don't remember the exact date, but I was 
very impressed by him. General Simpson was quite a

03:27.418 --> 03:30.482
person. Describe him. Make believe I'd never met 
him. Describe him. Well, you know, he was in the

03:33.646 --> 03:45.501
military all the way, and he was very well spoken 
when he speaks, when he was educated, and he spoke

03:33.646 --> 03:45.501
with authority. If he didn't like what you're 
saying, you'd sit on his face, his lips would

03:45.987 --> 03:54.567
tremble, and many times they trembled in front of 
me because we didn't agree on everything. The big

03:56.592 --> 04:03.388
change was he took me out of the chain of command 
with Dr. Williams, because I used to go directly

03:56.592 --> 04:03.388
with Dr. Williams. So then I go directly to General 
Simpson. It was very good having a direct chain,

04:09.014 --> 04:11.597
obviously. And sometimes it did not work to my 
personal advantage because I was recommended by

04:12.478 --> 04:30.038
the Army to General Simpson that I, when I was 
preparing for retirement, be retired and do the

04:12.478 --> 04:30.038
job that these guys are doing now. And General 
Simpson didn't even forward it. And I couldn't go

04:33.963 --> 04:38.288
around and I wouldn't and so forth. But I have that 
letter and I'm well aware of it. And I was called by

04:41.192 --> 04:46.118
the Army and told about it and so forth because they 
wanted me in. And I really wanted the job. But they

04:48.722 --> 04:55.290
could have easily made me a Don Johnson, Texas 
militiaman and that sort of stuff. But anyway,

04:55.410 --> 04:57.693
that was my only real conflict. Where did he 
office? I'm sorry? General Simpson, where was his

05:00.216 --> 05:02.119
office located? It was John Collis. And let's 
bring Coldis in. Coldis was not here when you

05:09.695 --> 05:13.260
arrived, was he? They were still doing Hannigan 
and then Dr. Coldis. Hannigan left. As far as you

05:18.546 --> 05:20.048
know, why did he leave? I have no idea. I just 
thought he was ready to go. And do you remember

05:24.194 --> 05:30.362
anything about the selection of John Coldis? Do 
you remember his coming to campus? I knew nothing

05:33.212 --> 05:34.515
about it. I was very impressed with him from the 
very beginning. Of course, a guy who's a

05:38.203 --> 05:48.267
workaholic and his memory for names, I just cannot 
believe it. And, you know, at fish camp, like you

05:49.006 --> 05:55.593
used to do, I'm sure you're aware, you go around the 
room and everybody says, where are they from, and

05:49.006 --> 05:55.593
this, that, and the other. I'll buy dinner for 
anybody that I can't recognize. I never bought a

05:59.598 --> 06:01.180
dinner. Let me, this is an editorial note to the 
typist. As the new dean of faculties, I sat in on

06:04.944 --> 06:17.258
some of the interviews for the new vice president 
for student services, we called it then. And we

06:18.520 --> 06:26.731
were all impressed with John Colas, but I was 
critical because I thought, my goodness, he's at

06:18.520 --> 06:26.731
East Texas State. Surely we can attract somebody 
from some big, famous school. And he wasn't an

06:31.918 --> 06:33.160
Aggie. He wasn't a Texan. He'd grown up in Gary, 
Indiana. And I thought, my, my, my, how will he be

06:36.985 --> 06:42.713
able to understand this school and what we are? 
Well, when he got here from the first day until the

06:43.734 --> 06:47.920
present, All of us have been deeply, deeply 
impressed with him as a person, with his unfailing

06:48.355 --> 07:02.274
memory of people's names, with his constant 
smile, ceaseless work habits. He was always,

07:03.136 --> 07:13.570
always trying to do what was best for Texas A&M and 
was a splendid, splendid choice for the job. All

07:14.900 --> 07:16.703
right, now, end of note. After he got here, what was 
your relationship as commandant to him as the vice

07:17.183 --> 07:24.995
president for students? Well, I used to visit him 
regularly and talk about things. And if there was

07:31.205 --> 07:34.149
something in the Corps, he'd talk to me about it and 
so forth. So his door was open, no question about

07:34.189 --> 07:37.414
it, night or day. And if there was a problem that 
related to the Corps, he'd call me at night and I'd

07:38.395 --> 07:44.164
take care of it the best I could. and we just had a 
good working relationship. I respected him a

07:48.497 --> 07:49.859
great deal. Did they move, they didn't move to that 
house on the campus immediately, did they? No, I

07:54.826 --> 08:08.989
don't know where the general deputy, I'm sorry, 
I'm in the admin building, the retired general

07:54.826 --> 08:08.989
that was on the head of the... Oh, Ludeke. Ludeke, 
Ludeke was still living there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:13.507 --> 08:20.317
did, what, as far as you could tell, what did cold 
us, what were his likes and his dislikes? What

08:22.200 --> 08:25.325
pleased him most and what frustrated him most? I'd 
say one, one thing that I never did much care about

08:25.345 --> 08:41.269
was, you know, with these weekly staff meetings we 
have, if it affected some personnel, people in the

08:25.345 --> 08:41.269
system, everybody had to vote on that sort of 
stuff, and I wasn't used to voting on whether some

08:41.755 --> 08:44.759
guy's got a job or doesn't. I'd talk to him myself, 
maybe, but I'd make the decision, and these

08:45.180 --> 09:07.031
decisions were made, I guess, on, well, I don't 
like this guy or I like this guy, you know, and when

08:45.180 --> 09:07.031
we first got an attorney over there, he was 
selected on that sort of basis, and so happened to

08:45.180 --> 09:07.031
be the one I liked the best, but that, to me, seemed 
like a command weakness, so to speak. But I really

09:07.712 --> 09:11.357
never had any run-ins with him of any major 
consequence and he supported me on everything

09:11.658 --> 09:17.286
that I did. He tried to give me as much funding as he 
could. This was a real difficult problem because I

09:21.773 --> 09:32.890
guess everybody had funding problems but for 
example we had a general almost every weekend and

09:33.241 --> 09:36.286
Many of those came out of my pocket to take care of 
them. I had no funds for renting a room or anything

09:36.346 --> 09:42.335
like that. I couldn't ask one of them to pay their 
room rent, although most of them had orders and

09:42.495 --> 09:47.363
could have done it. And most of them, as a matter of 
fact, did, but once in a while they didn't. Things

09:51.810 --> 09:54.774
like that were kind of a problem. And I'm glad to see 
the Commandant has more money than the President

09:55.115 --> 10:01.645
has, I think.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.684
It's a troublesome thing for the military, and I 
went through this thing. I had 36 general officers

10:05.784 --> 10:11.770
on campus for core things while I was commandant. 
Wow. It takes a lot of doings, and several of them

10:14.373 --> 10:20.339
stayed in our home, and I had four boys. It wasn't 
easy. They had to be friends also. If these were

10:23.202 --> 10:25.484
friends, I wouldn't have invited them to my home. 
Among all of those visitors, who were some of the

10:26.485 --> 10:30.089
most famous? Great neighbors. He was kind of my 
rabbi in the army. And I admired him greatly. I

10:39.306 --> 10:42.350
worked for him when I was a captain and a major. And 
I'd send him on numerous occasions. And the day he

10:46.677 --> 10:52.025
came down here was when Westport was having some 
problems up there. They had this shooting

10:52.065 --> 10:53.367
incident. And he got tears in his eyes for the 
Corps. So that was great. Well, you know, we had

11:02.077 --> 11:06.864
General Wyand, and he was the Air Force Chief of 
Staff. And when he came down, he had some kind of

11:06.884 --> 11:15.196
accident and was in a calf, so he was kind of hard to 
handle. But I've got a list of them. I just hadn't

11:19.322 --> 11:21.085
gone over that one too much. Most of them were Aggie 
oriented. A great many of them were Aggies. for any

11:28.615 --> 11:34.283
of those visitors, were there ever any incidents, 
any goofy things? Never anything that came to my

11:34.844 --> 11:37.988
mind. I will tell you, when an Air Force general was 
here, the Air Force was responsible for taking

11:38.529 --> 11:58.116
care of them, and they took care of one of these 
generals, I don't remember which one now, and he

11:38.529 --> 11:58.116
had a room over in the MSA, and they gave him the key, 
and they opened the door, and there was a man and his

11:38.529 --> 11:58.116
wife in bed, but they weren't doing anything, but 
they did. Well, they didn't do a very good job of

11:58.585 --> 12:01.569
checking it out before that general got there. 
Wrong room. So he was somewhat upset about that,

12:03.070 --> 12:06.534
but I was pranking them. I would have been, too. In 
the first place, they should have gone with him and

12:07.596 --> 12:10.479
put him in the room. In those days when you were 
commandant,

12:11.520 --> 12:23.194
did the Corps ever attempt any pranks involving a 
visitor? No. I've never heard of any. No, they were

12:25.677 --> 12:26.618
always. courteous and they respected those 
generals. Most of those generals wanted to spend

12:29.697 --> 12:38.746
time over in the quad if they could, but the 
majority of them just flew in and flew out and they

12:29.697 --> 12:38.746
had busy schedules. What did those visitors say to 
you about their impression of A&M and about the

12:39.046 --> 12:43.911
Corps? Well, they were nothing but impressed. As a 
matter of fact, the only reason I could come up with

12:47.414 --> 12:55.322
these names is I have letters from all of these 
people that wrote, and they were always good about

12:55.707 --> 12:58.931
Thank you for what you and Mrs. Parsons did, and 
this, that, and the other. And most of them were

12:58.951 --> 13:06.060
personalized, and they were very favorable. Now, 
y'all were living where, you and your family? We

13:10.286 --> 13:11.748
were down on Rosemary. And how difficult was it, 
when you moved here, how difficult was it to find a

13:12.729 --> 13:17.395
house that you liked? Well, I always had a large 
house when I was a colonel. No, but I mean, was it

13:21.514 --> 13:24.519
difficult to find a house when you got here? Oh, 
heck no. Okay. No, they hadn't money yet. You know,

13:28.145 --> 13:30.008
Roadmap is a pretty good neighborhood. And I built 
a house right there on the corner. I've forgotten

13:34.136 --> 13:37.281
the address, across from the TV station. And when 
my wife died, my son said he'd never spend another

13:38.082 --> 13:43.652
night there, so I packed the neighbor away. But I 
loved it there. And then I married again, and we

13:45.946 --> 14:04.830
lived in a rented place out there by that 
restaurant out on the road there, where they had a

13:45.946 --> 14:04.830
pond around it, I can't even remember the name of 
it, towards Kirkland. Oh, going out east. Right.

14:06.706 --> 14:11.171
And then I built a home over on the other side. Did 
the Corps ever attempt any pranks on your house?

14:16.538 --> 14:16.718
No. Or your car or anything like that? If it was, we 
had, my wife had a Corvette, the other one, and it

14:18.681 --> 14:27.051
was egged one time, but I don't think it was Corps. I 
think it was just people would do things. It was

14:30.355 --> 14:31.797
probably against my kids. Did the, were there ever 
any phone calls in the middle of the night? Well,

14:38.302 --> 14:39.683
yeah. From the war members you mean? No, no, no 
jokes, no pranks. No, I never had anything but good

14:46.610 --> 14:53.036
relations with them all the time. The, I will tell 
one story, you know, I also was bonfire advisor,

14:53.056 --> 15:01.564
although I used Jerry Maynard mostly for that 
business, But after I retired and was over at the

15:02.135 --> 15:08.644
police department and still under John Colders, I 
maintained that job. And one night I got a call from

15:08.684 --> 15:18.497
a prof, and I can't remember his name, and I 
wouldn't want to name it anyway, but it lived over

15:08.684 --> 15:18.497
there and across the street from the bonfire. And, 
you know, they turn that music up a few decibels,

15:18.518 --> 15:24.065
and this was 3, 3.15 in the morning. And he 
identified himself, and, are you the bonfire

15:25.527 --> 15:29.412
advisor? And he said, Well, I want that damn music 
turned down. I can't sleep, and it's so loud, and

15:32.665 --> 15:38.856
it's doing this, that, and the other, and I think 
it's totally irresponsible, and ranting and

15:32.665 --> 15:38.856
raving. I said, yes, sir, I'll take care of it. 
Well, I called him up, and I said, turn the damn

15:41.060 --> 15:44.726
music down. It is wrong, and it shouldn't be 
blasting our way in it. You've got to have that, get

15:48.112 --> 15:49.955
some earphones or something. Well, they turned it 
down. And I couldn't get back to sleep, and my wife

15:51.595 --> 15:54.138
couldn't. So we just said, well, let's get up. By 
now it's about 4. I said, I'm going to call him back.

15:59.464 --> 16:04.570
And I called him back, and I said, Dr. So-and-so, I 
just wanted to check and make sure everything was

15:59.464 --> 16:04.570
okay. And wham, he slammed that thing down. He hung 
up on me. And so the next morning I went over to Dr.

16:09.175 --> 16:15.842
Kohler, and I said, John, I need to tell you this, 
because you'll probably get a phone call, but

16:09.175 --> 16:15.842
here's what I did. And he laughed and said, that's 
good bull. And he never got a phone call. Describe

16:21.599 --> 16:26.445
the routine of Bonfire in your years. Well, it was 
not near as sophisticated as it is nowadays. We had

16:31.912 --> 16:43.928
the crane and all that stuff, but pretty much it was 
mostly core, although a good many of the civilian

16:31.912 --> 16:43.928
students worked on it. It was not as closely 
supervised. I went to the cutting areas and like

16:46.858 --> 16:51.142
that, but no more than just to walk around. I never 
stayed out there. And the, was it, when you got

16:53.925 --> 16:59.731
here, was it, had it been moved to the Duncan area? 
It was the Duncan area. Okay. And were there, do you

17:02.414 --> 17:05.598
remember any accidents, any problems? Well, no 
real problems other than, you know, once in a while

17:06.278 --> 17:11.704
somebody would get hurt. We did have two students 
killed during this era, but it was bonfire related

17:12.359 --> 17:35.059
in that there were the freshman and sophomore who 
had worked all night, and when they got off the

17:12.359 --> 17:35.059
deal, they decided to take a trip over to the little 
house over there. much sleep and he had a root

17:35.444 --> 17:42.036
bridge and killed him and I never of course told his 
parents what happened. I just told them they were

17:42.056 --> 17:44.000
in an accident.

17:47.706 --> 17:54.098
During the bonfire building in that era, it was 
only logs. They were using chainsaws and heavy

17:54.559 --> 17:58.566
trucks and so forth. Were they also organized as 
red pots and things like that? They had this red pot

18:02.904 --> 18:05.608
hut, which I never went inside. I knew what was 
going on in there. What was it? Some drinking?

18:10.837 --> 18:12.379
Beer. I told them they shouldn't have it out here, 
but I just did not enforce it. I probably could

18:18.850 --> 18:20.573
have, but I didn't do it. About how long did the 
cutting take? Three weeks. About three weeks. And

18:29.873 --> 18:34.461
the bonfire in its shape was how many tiers high? 
About four. It wasn't a whole lot smaller than what

18:38.107 --> 18:40.972
they were doing over here. And every year, you 
know, we set a limit and we'd go out there and check

18:41.573 --> 18:46.642
over the limit. And it was always that way. Did you 
or anybody else ever get any direction from

18:52.073 --> 19:00.006
someone outside about doing this or that? Not 
really. I never heard of anything. Everybody was

19:03.611 --> 19:05.494
pretty positive. The problem is that, you know, 
the students when they come to Bonfire are all

19:05.514 --> 19:09.781
loaded. It was the former students out there 
raising hell, which I found out when I was in the

19:09.841 --> 19:19.617
police department because I used to have people in 
plain clothes around there and so was I. And that

19:20.390 --> 19:23.735
was where the trouble spots were, with the nickel. 
In terms of other Aggie traditions, from the

19:23.755 --> 19:35.093
Commandant's point of view, what role did the 
Commandant's office play for silver tap

19:23.755 --> 19:35.093
ceremonies? Well, we cooperated with it. I mean, 
turning the lights out and that sort of stuff. And

19:39.459 --> 19:43.185
the officers were encouraged to attend, but most 
of them were Aggies anyway. And we didn't have to do

19:44.086 --> 19:46.069
anything with nickel. But you see, the light 
business was still on them where everybody turned

19:49.550 --> 19:51.772
the lights off. During my tenure here, it softened 
up on that, so it wasn't quite the same, but still

19:51.993 --> 20:00.322
the meaning is still the same. Did you and your 
staff normally go to Silvertaps? I went to them. I,

20:04.727 --> 20:07.991
of course, don't know who went. What about a home 
football weekend? Describe the commandant's

20:10.534 --> 20:14.538
activities in the home football game. Well, 
basically, he's taking care of whoever the guest

20:14.958 --> 20:18.122
is. and making sure that they get to the 
president's mansion and to their game and all that

20:18.912 --> 20:25.459
sort of stuff. Let's be the reviewing officer. 
Right, because as far as the Corps, the Corps

20:27.341 --> 20:31.586
organized all that. And, you know, we had people 
working with them and getting the tickets away

20:32.687 --> 20:37.613
from them. Like I was telling my wife this morning, 
there will be a lot of Aggies in the Corps who ain't

20:38.414 --> 20:45.662
in the Corps. because a lot of them couldn't get a 
ticket. They'd put on a uniform and march in with

20:48.099 --> 20:51.382
them. I bet you that happens too. And normally did 
the reviewing officer come commercial air or did

20:53.984 --> 21:03.874
they come on a private? Mostly it was military air, 
sometimes commercial, but they were pretty big

21:04.394 --> 21:11.141
wheels. And then? Would you take them to midnight 
yell practice? If they wanted to go, but most of

21:18.200 --> 21:21.544
them didn't come to spend the night. Oh, they came 
Saturday? The big guys would just come in here and

21:23.507 --> 21:28.894
go to the review and go back. Some of them spent the 
night, but those that wanted to go, we took them to

21:28.914 --> 21:35.562
midnight, but not many of them wanted to. Do you 
remember some of the happy moments? What were some

21:38.859 --> 21:44.989
of the nicest things you remember relating to 
those visitors and football games? Well, it was,

21:45.570 --> 21:49.416
you know, all of them were just gentlemen. Most of 
them had their wife or family sometimes,

21:49.716 --> 21:56.347
particularly if they were around from this area. 
Oh, I'll tell you one. It was General Patton when he

21:58.550 --> 22:00.433
was here. This is the son of George S. Patton. 
Right. He did not like to be referred to as a son of

22:03.993 --> 22:08.379
General Patner, of course. I don't blame him. He's 
a gentleman in his own right, and he's a good one.

22:12.424 --> 22:15.168
But he did something that surprised the hell out of 
me. When we were on the reviewing stand, boy, he was

22:15.188 --> 22:18.853
impressed to beat hell. And he says, you know, I 
know this ain't going to look good, but it's okay if

22:18.873 --> 22:23.659
I take pictures. And he pulled a camera out, and he 
was just too shy taking pictures. That impressed

22:27.143 --> 22:29.106
me. because it's not exactly fully mirrored 
there, you know, but I could have told him, heck, we

22:29.609 --> 22:49.494
can get you all the pictures you want, but he, that 
stuck with me, and oh, I can't, my name, you'll know

22:29.609 --> 22:49.494
him, the black general we had over there who became 
the Prairie View president. Oh, yes, yes. I can't

22:51.357 --> 22:54.621
even remember right now, but he was two-star out of 
here, and And he brought his family over and, you

22:55.242 --> 23:02.290
know, the Corps really liked him. And he did walk 
around with them and that sort of stuff and do the

23:03.371 --> 23:07.736
things they liked. And, of course, blacks were not 
many of them around in those days. All right. Back

23:12.741 --> 23:14.723
to your task during the football game. So you would 
be hosting the visitor for the game. Where did you

23:19.869 --> 23:21.811
all sit during the football games? Usually up in 
the president's box there, you know, in the lower

23:22.032 --> 23:25.215
level. after they got the sky box once in a while, he 
would invite us up there. And then, when the game's

23:30.650 --> 23:33.656
over, then what? Well, usually they were ready to 
go to bed or go home. And if they were staying over,

23:37.563 --> 23:43.854
we'd take them out to dinner or have them in the 
house or something like that. There was no

23:43.894 --> 23:46.559
entertainment to speak of. Once in a while, 
there'd be some guy One or two of them wanted to get

23:49.613 --> 23:51.835
in a poker game. I don't gamble, but I knew some 
people that did. We set that up, and that's a bunch

23:55.519 --> 23:57.802
of Aggies. But they were no problem whatsoever, 
other than the fact that you're tied down. You're

24:04.009 --> 24:05.530
not with the Corps. You're with those people, as 
you should be. During all of your years, did we ever

24:07.793 --> 24:13.579
have any international visitors? I don't 
remember having any. I don't remember any either.

24:18.238 --> 24:23.625
I do remember another bonfire incident that you 
probably heard of and nobody may have brought it

24:18.238 --> 24:23.625
up. One year after I was in the police department, I 
was standing over there by the huts they have out

24:23.765 --> 24:42.908
there where they're selling the cokes and things, 
and a car pulls up out there and stops, and a guy

24:23.765 --> 24:42.908
jumps out and runs into the bonfire and throws a 
Molotov on it, and there was a fireman from over at

24:23.765 --> 24:42.908
College Station. And the kids around the bonfire, 
they took off running after him. This guy, the car

24:47.367 --> 24:49.950
he was in, they took off and left him. And he ran over 
across the street over in those houses over there.

24:53.895 --> 24:55.176
And they were hot on his trail. And he went into a 
home over there which happened to be occupied and

24:55.236 --> 25:01.243
rented to a bunch of girls and hid under a bed over 
there. And they found him over there. And

25:02.324 --> 25:06.509
fortunately, the police found him before the kids 
found him. But... And he was a college station

25:07.270 --> 25:10.013
fireman? Yes. And he was, he was. He was fired, of 
course, but. And, and it, and the button. It did not

25:17.440 --> 25:20.443
ignite it, but it could have. You know, it hadn't 
been fueled or anything, but there's not no green

25:20.463 --> 25:26.228
logs. It's not as easy as it looked, but it was just a 
Molotov cocktail. But I had to be standing out

25:30.572 --> 25:39.861
there, and I got on, I had my radio, and I called the 
University Police, and told them they

25:30.572 --> 25:39.861
hot-footed, but College Station was already out 
there doing their job. And during your years, as

25:40.735 --> 25:52.191
far as you were aware, did any of our students ever 
kidnap any of the other Southwest Conference

25:40.735 --> 25:52.191
mascots? Well, yes, they did. They got Bevo. Can 
you share any information about that? Well, I know

25:58.479 --> 26:05.249
he would not particularly want his name, but I'll 
tell you who it was, John Adams. Well, you know

26:05.269 --> 26:06.010
John. Oh, sure. John was CO. He's going to be there 
tonight. Yeah, I know he will. He's a very close

26:10.385 --> 26:12.127
friend of mine. John was CO of Squadron 3. And 
Squadron 3 engineered this thing. And the first

26:17.054 --> 26:21.459
time I knew of it, I was in the office. It was about 4, 
35 o'clock in the morning. This was shortly after

26:23.422 --> 26:25.344
my wife died. And I couldn't, you know, get up and go 
right to the office. I'm sitting there, and I hear

26:31.092 --> 26:32.774
all the noise. And I headed for the quad. And Dr. 
Williams headed for the quad. at least I'm told.

26:40.969 --> 26:45.475
And I saw that steer horns up and I turned and left 
and went back to the office. Anyway, next morning,

26:46.096 --> 26:55.829
Dr. Williams and I got together and he was taking 
care of the business for the University of Texas.

26:56.610 --> 27:01.817
And John was terribly afraid he was going to be 
kicked out of the university. And his father was an

27:02.758 --> 27:09.147
Air Force colonel and he flew out from Florida 
intercede and whatever i never had any attention i

27:09.346 --> 27:31.523
couldn't kick him out anyway i thought i 
recommended probably could have i thought you

27:09.346 --> 27:31.523
know it happened and uh i remember dr williams did a 
marvelous job of cooling that thing down but the

27:09.346 --> 27:31.523
true story when i asked john that's not long ago i'd 
always heard that on the way back they had a flat

27:09.346 --> 27:31.523
tire over in the caldwell And they're fixing the 
flat and this highway patrol car pulls up. And this

27:37.333 --> 27:41.179
guy asked him, you know, what are you boys up to? 
We've got a flat. We're trying to get this steer

27:41.880 --> 27:46.987
that we're taking over to vet college out to A&M. 
And the guy walked around and looked at it and

27:47.047 --> 27:51.493
obviously knew what it was. And he said, well, I'll 
tell you what I'm going to do. And he had gloves on.

27:54.778 --> 27:56.680
He took his gloves off and he put it up there. And he 
says, I'm going to let you go this time. He had an

27:58.964 --> 28:00.025
Aggie ring on him. Oh, that's marvelous. And I 
asked John, is that a true tale? And John said, yes,

28:05.671 --> 28:06.773
it is. Oh, that's marvelous. That is marvelous. 
And John may have asked me about it, but I'll tell

28:09.397 --> 28:14.545
you another one on John, too. Well, he went in the 
Air Force for three months and then got out. And he

28:18.531 --> 28:21.656
came by to see me and said he needed a job. He said, 
you probably won't hire me because of it. I said,

28:24.507 --> 28:27.211
John, what's that got to do with it? Anyway, I did 
get a position for him one month, $9,000 a year.

28:34.063 --> 28:37.468
This was 1973, I think. Anyway, he worked for me two 
or three years there in the office and did an

28:38.630 --> 28:45.081
outstanding job. We became very close. still are, 
and I provided him a lot of input to his book because

28:49.448 --> 29:04.590
some idiot had told him that no U.S. Army unit ever 
reached the Yalu River during the war. And I had

29:05.552 --> 29:08.456
told him about being on the Yalu River. And he said, 
I'm not asking you on your word, but can you

29:08.776 --> 29:13.423
document it? And I said, you bet I can document it. I 
said, how would you like to see a picture of Buffalo

29:18.693 --> 29:26.167
Bill Quinn, who was the regimental commander, and 
all the officers that could leave the place of duty

29:18.693 --> 29:26.167
pissing in the Yalu River. And I have that. Anyway, 
he said he didn't think he needed that, but I sent

29:28.071 --> 29:33.401
him a couple of articles. But our regiment was the 
only regiment to reach it. And we left it a lot

29:37.950 --> 29:41.376
faster than we got there, and we lost a lot of 
people. unfortunately, but we got out before the

29:42.082 --> 29:49.635
other regiment at Reservoir. We lost a lot of 
people at Reservoir. I was good in Marines, but the

29:51.799 --> 29:55.525
Marines probably took the biggest loss. But 
anyway, that's another Adam's tale there. But my

29:59.712 --> 30:05.963
other Adam's tale that he doesn't want me to ever 
tell anybody, we were, I was This time I was still a

30:06.500 --> 30:14.893
widower and we were talking about girls in the 
Corps and what they were going to wear and this,

30:06.500 --> 30:14.893
that, and the other. And the uniformed people sent 
me six pair of pantyhose to ask me what color did

30:14.974 --> 30:22.686
they want us to stock. I said, what the hell is it? 
And I get John in. And John knew about as much as me.

30:29.357 --> 30:30.178
And I said, John? You've got a problem here now. 
You're working with this program. And I said,

30:33.593 --> 30:35.876
here's a sample of the pantyhose. I want to know 
what color do you recommend we use? And I gave him

30:38.060 --> 30:41.405
the pantyhose, and that was his job. And he said, 
don't you ever tell anybody that story.

30:51.381 --> 30:54.867
In terms of all of the things to worry about and so 
forth, Did, during your years, were there any

30:55.218 --> 31:01.155
attempts by anybody to try to kidnap Reveley? I 
don't know of any, but I... And do you remember

31:02.479 --> 31:06.190
any...
