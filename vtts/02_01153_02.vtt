WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:03.482
was being involved. And then know ahead of time 
what was going on. And if I didn't like it, do all I

00:07.487 --> 00:10.691
could to head it off. It's easier to prevent 
something than it is to change it. More after it's

00:12.833 --> 00:13.895
done, yeah. Yeah. And so I was a director for about 
10 years. And one day, some of them came up to me and

00:18.520 --> 00:27.712
said, would you run for chairman of the board? And I 
said, yeah, I would like to. And this was in...

00:33.983 --> 00:44.220
That's when they first approached me, because it 
was in 78, February of 78, I was elected chairman of

00:33.983 --> 00:44.220
the board. And

00:45.603 --> 00:57.443
that whole year I was... Is that rotating, or is 
that an annual, or can you continue re-election?

00:57.777 --> 01:03.423
In the TVMA, you cannot be re-elected to the post 
that you have. That's in any of the posts. If you're

01:06.226 --> 01:09.890
third vice president, you cannot run for third 
vice president. Now, if you're second vice

01:09.910 --> 01:13.434
president, you can run for third vice president. 
But you cannot run for the office that you

01:13.594 --> 01:17.699
presently hold. So I finished the year as chairman 
of the board, and I ran for third vice president,

01:18.940 --> 01:25.928
and I got beat. I got beat out by Dennis McIntosh, 
who had gotten beat out twice, but he had run for

01:27.528 --> 01:46.498
third vice president, got beat out, and he ran 
again for second vice president, got beat out by

01:27.528 --> 01:46.498
the same guy, and then the next year came up, I was 
running for third vice president, so he ran for

01:27.528 --> 01:46.498
third vice president, and he beat me. So I was as 
stubborn as he was, so I ran against him, ran for

01:47.459 --> 01:54.430
second vice president the next year, and he beat me 
again. And in the meantime I got busy and I didn't

01:54.764 --> 01:59.091
have enough time to deal with it. So I laid out 
several years, I mean I was still a director, but I

01:59.191 --> 02:08.466
wasn't running for any of the offices. And I guess 
it was in the,

02:08.486 --> 02:16.259
I'm not sure just what year it was, was it eight 
years ago? I guess it was in eight.

02:25.004 --> 02:29.149
I was just 15 years old at that time, so it was in 82.

02:32.954 --> 02:39.283
Maybe that's when we just changed over to the new 
bylaws, which had a chairman-elect. So they no

02:40.404 --> 02:49.075
longer, this is the last time they would elect a 
chairman because there's one elected

02:40.404 --> 02:49.075
chairman-elect, and it was in the early years. And 
I was sitting out there waiting for the board of

02:49.095 --> 02:54.943
directors meeting to start, and there's four or 
five of them come over to me, and they says... will

02:55.514 --> 02:57.217
you run for chairman of the board? What? And we want 
you to run for chairman of the board. We've got

03:03.767 --> 03:07.011
somebody we want to get in as chairman-elect. He 
says, but you've already been chairman once, so

03:07.032 --> 03:12.540
you know about what it is. You don't need to be 
chairman-elect. Will you run for

03:14.042 --> 03:15.504
chairman-elect? I said, sure. And so at the end of 
the meeting, when they come up, I'm in for

03:17.327 --> 03:22.054
chairman-elect. I'm in chairman, and I won. So as 
far as I know, I was the first one to ever be, first

03:24.438 --> 03:29.683
and only one to ever be chairman of the board twice. 
But there was a stand in between. And I succeeded

03:33.287 --> 03:45.039
and went up the steps, third vice president, 
second vice president, first president, second

03:33.287 --> 03:45.039
president, all through it. I had been opposed on 
several of those, but I was fortunate all of those I

03:46.020 --> 03:52.707
did win.

03:53.412 --> 03:57.055
So you became president in 87. Now, at that time, 
were there any special problems or situations

03:57.095 --> 04:06.024
sort of facing the association that you felt like 
you were particularly willing to deal with? Well,

04:06.684 --> 04:16.874
the biggest thing that I was wanting to try to deal 
with at that time was membership and apathy.

04:19.656 --> 04:21.698
Membership's always going to be a problem. I feel 
that there is no reason in the world why we don't

04:22.657 --> 04:35.074
have 100% of the veterinarians belong to the state 
association, but we don't. We have about

04:35.134 --> 04:43.685
two-thirds, which every time I go to one of the 
other states, they say, well, you're doing real

04:35.134 --> 04:43.685
good, but I'm still not proud of that. So I've 
worked hard on trying to get increasing

04:45.968 --> 04:52.377
membership. We get some, we get some. But there's a 
whole lot of them that the veterinarian today is

04:54.678 --> 05:01.329
smarter than they were when I first got in. There's 
a whole bunch of them that can figure. They know

05:04.194 --> 05:13.570
that they don't pass laws that are good for 
veterinarians that are members of the

05:04.194 --> 05:13.570
association. They pass laws that are good for 
veterinarians. being that we've got an

05:17.635 --> 05:21.499
association that's strong, and they work and 
lobby and get these things paid for. They're

05:21.519 --> 05:22.641
willing to let you do it. And so for the $150 that 
they paid, you know how many cases of beer they can

05:23.001 --> 05:27.566
buy? I mean, you know, figure that real quick. I 
mean, shoot, I can ride along free. And like I've

05:32.732 --> 05:38.198
told them, you know, the apathy fits in there then, 
too. We've got a lot of members that are paying in.

05:44.129 --> 05:45.871
to do things for other people. And they don't ever 
say anything to them. Where if the same guy was

05:49.174 --> 05:59.985
running the wire over their house and draining 
their electricity from them, so he didn't have to

05:49.174 --> 05:59.985
pay the electric bill, man, they'd jump on him in a 
hurry. If he was out there siphoning gas out of his

06:00.005 --> 06:04.750
truck, he'd be on him in a hurry. But it's the same 
thing, see. And say, well, he's a good old boy. I

06:07.973 --> 06:08.694
know him. And you know that my kids go to school with 
his kids and all that. I don't ever say anything to

06:11.897 --> 06:14.119
him. It's stealing. Somewhat in the same 
connection, what kind of relationships did you

06:16.260 --> 06:22.770
have with the college when you were president? And 
do you see an apathy or a schism or a lack of

06:22.830 --> 06:29.281
communication between the college and the 
profession? Well, the college in general, I have

06:29.721 --> 06:33.788
good relationships with. Individuals at the 
college, it all depends. Some of them I have very

06:37.814 --> 06:42.081
bad relations with. I've never been one to beat 
around the bush. I call a spade a spade, a son of a

06:44.618 --> 06:49.304
bitch a son of a bitch, and that's the way it is. And 
some of them don't like it. And the college is, I see

06:52.769 --> 07:08.170
it, and you may take offense to admit that you're 
part of the college, but the college, in a way, is

06:52.769 --> 07:08.170
only interested about the college. Yeah, I think 
there is. They're looking after themselves. They

07:13.201 --> 07:15.184
claim, well, it's for the profession. And yes, it 
is, in a way. But yet, they're still, number one,

07:17.448 --> 07:22.015
it's a self-aggrandizing sort of thing. I mean, 
they're not going to beat themselves out of a job.

07:24.279 --> 07:27.344
And it's always looking, well, can I get another 
brother in here? Like I was mentioning, the

07:28.045 --> 07:31.030
difference in the size of the faculty. Yeah, I 
picked up on that. 19 when I was there, they've got

07:33.445 --> 07:40.312
twice as many students now, and they've got five or 
six times more faculty, and they're

07:33.445 --> 07:40.312
short-handed. Some of them are not working. And 
I'm not sure just where a nice, happy medium is

07:44.816 --> 07:48.840
there. I mean, I don't want to be one that is against 
progress. But I don't want to be just, you know,

07:52.644 --> 07:59.250
you're paying the bills for all kinds of things. So 
there are some at the college that, I mean, in

07:59.838 --> 08:04.022
general, I got along good. Oh, yeah, I know. I mean, 
I went out of my way, for one thing, because in the

08:05.283 --> 08:12.449
position as president of the TVMA, you need to keep 
good relations. And we even established an extra

08:12.569 --> 08:23.958
committee the year that I was president-elect for 
coordinating a lot of things to where we get a

08:12.569 --> 08:23.958
little better relationship. Because one of the 
bad relationships we had with it, I was telling

08:24.038 --> 08:29.423
you, we don't have but about two-thirds 
membership in the total profession in there, but

08:30.297 --> 08:35.683
it's even lower than that of college professors. 
Yeah, that's what I've picked up on quite a bit. And

08:37.826 --> 08:42.892
there again, when I go to other states that have 
universities, they say, God, you're doing real

08:37.826 --> 08:42.892
good. There's only one state that has a better 
percentage. That's North Carolina, and the state

08:45.315 --> 08:47.337
pays their dues. So they all belong. Well, when 
they established their veterinary school there,

08:51.442 --> 09:04.456
they established it that the fees that they take 
in, part of it goes into a fund to pay the professors

08:51.442 --> 09:04.456
professional dues to various things. And a 
certain percentage of that goes in that pot for

09:05.417 --> 09:10.202
that. And they're the only ones that are ahead of 
us. But that's kind of a problem area, I sense. And

09:16.088 --> 09:18.070
you need to be heading back to your office pretty 
quick. But what are some of the What do you see as the

09:21.749 --> 09:25.713
major problems facing the profession today? And 
if you were writing a history of veterinary

09:26.373 --> 09:32.159
medicine, what kind of message do you think such a 
history should convey? The history is there for

09:32.920 --> 09:34.261
itself. The future bothers me in a way, except that 
I'm an eternal optimist. I think veterinarians

09:41.568 --> 09:44.791
are hardy and they're going to survive. Things are 
going to go now. Veterinarians need to quit being

09:47.714 --> 09:50.777
so apathetic And I have to say veterinarians and 
Aggies, because there's so many of them, and most

09:51.787 --> 10:06.103
of the veterinarians in the state are Aggies, and 
they're all gung-ho for their school, and

09:51.787 --> 10:06.103
anything the school does has got to be right, you 
know. It's not subtle. They've got to question a

10:08.645 --> 10:10.808
few things that come by. I used to be the same way, 
you know. Sure, yeah. Whatever the school did, you

10:13.390 --> 10:17.235
know, that is right, because these guys are the 
professors. They're the ones that taught me. I

10:19.934 --> 10:26.162
didn't start thinking different until none of 
those that taught me are there anymore. Is the

10:26.182 --> 10:32.890
Aggie Association a professional plus? I don't 
know. I never thought about that before. I don't

10:35.373 --> 10:35.813
know. With the public, with the general public. It 
is and it isn't. To other Aggies, it darn sure

10:39.838 --> 10:42.141
isn't. Oh, sure. Others are not because I 
personally have always said that the two most

10:43.523 --> 10:48.709
obnoxious people in the world As far as school 
people are concerned are people from Arkansas and

10:49.111 --> 10:57.080
people from A&M and outsiders. And of course if 
you're an insider, well they're great. But anyway

11:01.405 --> 11:08.893
they tend to never question anything that the 
school does because it is the school. The same way

11:08.953 --> 11:13.498
for years I'd go to a seminar and because the guy was 
behind the microphone Whatever he said was law. He

11:15.101 --> 11:16.103
was right. That's wrong. I began to question 
things. I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but

11:19.128 --> 11:24.337
I'm no dummy. Some of these things are wrong. You do 
need to question. I think that one of the things

11:30.007 --> 11:36.178
that has come up that bothers me more than anything 
is the fact that I hate to see anybody give up

11:37.238 --> 11:44.726
privileges or things, and they're pushing to get a 
national license. I could argue both sides, but I

11:45.207 --> 11:52.695
hate to see a state give up its right to issue 
licenses. Is the AVMA pushing that role? Oh, yeah.

11:55.337 --> 12:00.983
Everybody's pushing to get, you know, if you can be 
licensed in the country, then you can go anywhere

11:55.337 --> 12:00.983
you want. I'm not for that, and also special 
licenses. I agree with that. to a point, depending

12:07.445 --> 12:10.269
on what it is. But if they're going to start 
training technicians to do things, you're going

12:10.389 --> 12:15.756
to do it in the way of veterinarians. And the first 
thing, it's going to come to a mechanic. It's no

12:20.423 --> 12:23.647
longer going to be an art of medicine. It's going to 
be a mechanic of medicine. And it worries me. I'm

12:29.555 --> 12:30.596
not going to live that long. I was watching that, 
then, because I was not aware of that national

12:30.677 --> 12:34.502
licensing. Well, they're pushing for it. Pew 
Report is just out in there. I got it. I've been

12:39.661 --> 12:41.784
going through that. I'm reading it. There are some 
things in there that, there again, I can see both

12:42.866 --> 12:57.106
sides, and I can argue both ways, and it's like so 
many things that you have to be careful what you

12:42.866 --> 12:57.106
allow, because when you allow these, you open the 
gate for the other. You cannot be selective. So if

12:59.529 --> 13:04.135
you can't, you better shut the door on the thing 
that you like. I'd like to see... limited

13:05.900 --> 13:06.901
licensure. Just telling you, my youngest 
daughter is not a veterinarian, but she's a

13:07.342 --> 13:11.887
breeding specialist. And she does have real 
transfer. Well, this is a big hot thing right now.

13:17.754 --> 13:27.806
And they had proposed last legislation to allow 
them at your licensing for real transfer, those

13:17.754 --> 13:27.806
that were not veterinarians. Well, they decided, 
no, it's what we'll do. We'll leave it like it is.

13:31.430 --> 13:34.894
And as long as nobody is complaining, it's OK. But I 
feel that it should be limiting licensure. Now, I

13:39.538 --> 13:46.629
feel this way that if you have somebody that's a 
specialist, I mean, she's got her master's in that

13:39.538 --> 13:46.629
field. It's not a matter of you're taking some guy 
that's a dropout from high school, and you're

13:46.829 --> 13:54.121
training him to do this and letting him do it. I 
mean, there's a difference there. There's a

13:55.303 --> 14:01.793
difference in degree and difference in skill. 
Well, this would, to me, be something like your

14:02.110 --> 14:07.136
anesthesiologist or something like that. Well, 
this is where limited licensure should come. See,

14:10.660 --> 14:20.911
there's a lot of people that are board-certified 
specialists that would like to move to this state,

14:10.660 --> 14:20.911
but say their surgeries are filled. They have to 
take the general testing. Hey, now wait a minute,

14:23.955 --> 14:28.540
why don't you license me to do surgery on a referral 
basis? I can see that that could probably and

14:30.241 --> 14:34.347
should be done. But they do that for the 
professors, more or less. They have a limited

14:37.912 --> 14:41.858
licensure for the professors at the college. For a 
long time, they didn't have to have a license if

14:41.878 --> 14:45.403
they were in the college. Well, now it's in the law. 
They have to have one, but they can take a separate

14:47.446 --> 14:55.438
kind of an exam, but they have to only work They can 
do consulting work. I mean, they can't moonlight.

14:58.822 --> 15:00.804
They can just do what comes through the clinic. And 
there's some of them before, you know, they're

15:02.106 --> 15:08.493
doing the clinic, and then they got a friend out 
here, you know, they do this, and they moonlight.

15:08.613 --> 15:12.878
Well, that's illegal because it's their licenses 
they're not taking. That's interesting. I can see

15:13.840 --> 15:15.081
where that would be. I mean, none of this is cut and 
dry that this is good or bad. With any good, there's

15:18.745 --> 15:20.287
always some bad. Yeah. So there's really a lot 
going on in the profession in terms of that. And

15:24.372 --> 15:25.273
that's why I'd try to stay, I want to be one of those 
that is in on the discussion. And at least I know

15:32.456 --> 15:38.125
that I got it in my legs even if I got outvoted. And 
Lord knows I've been outvoted many, many times.

15:43.172 --> 15:44.574
It's easy. Well, for one thing, I get uneasy if 
things are going to railroad. I mean, everything

15:49.782 --> 15:50.964
is all good. Now, I'll stand up and I'll say, I'll 
holler, hey, now wait a minute. There's got to be a

15:54.076 --> 15:55.919
downside somewhere. And we better discuss this 
now and find out what it is ahead of time. And so I've

16:02.468 --> 16:06.413
taken some stands on things that I really didn't 
believe in. But just in order to raise the point.

16:09.557 --> 16:13.363
Yeah, and of course then they said, well, Zeke will 
argue about anything. They're right. They're

16:14.724 --> 16:15.666
right. That's good. That's good. So you need a good 
critic around. Somebody to call the halt to things

16:24.147 --> 16:28.033
I guess I better let you get back to your place of 
business, but I really appreciate it. Is there

16:28.053 --> 16:30.517
anything that you'd like to know? Not that I know of 
right now, but if you don't mind, I'd like to feel

16:30.537 --> 16:34.243
free to call. Anytime. Let me get your phone number 
and everything down. Area code 817-283-5771.

16:43.297 --> 16:44.759
That's the office. At home, it's 281-8056.

16:50.843 --> 16:57.310
I really don't expect you to call me, but there 
might be something coming up that I really need

16:50.843 --> 16:57.310
some good information on.
