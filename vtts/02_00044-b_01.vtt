WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:08.946
people to buy into the fact that they're part of a college team.

00:09.447 --> 00:18.019
And, you know, I hope we don't lose that because it's one of the real assets that we have.

00:18.099 --> 00:28.333
I mean, you know, Jim Benjamin at accounting, Jim has historically done a wonderful job of getting the accounting profession to support his department.

00:28.853 --> 00:41.243
But at the time that we were in our last capital campaign, we wanted to go to Arthur Anderson for a major gift that resulted in the naming of the building.

00:42.522 --> 00:50.272
Jim was fully supportive of the fact that it was a broader scope than this support for the accounting department.

00:50.292 --> 00:54.237
And, you know, it couldn't have happened without his support.

00:54.797 --> 01:01.166
And, like I say, I mean, that just happens, and I don't think anybody can take credit for it.

01:01.186 --> 01:05.110
You just try to create an environment where it's conducive to that.

01:05.171 --> 01:08.715
And I think the best way to do that is a very open kind of atmosphere.

01:08.695 --> 01:15.170
And in terms of faculty evaluations, have you all operated under a merit system?

01:15.752 --> 01:21.726
Yeah, always, and we require annual evaluations.

01:21.976 --> 01:35.654
Generally, we have been held up, and this was in place before I got here, but we have been held up as an example, I think, in most discussions about annual evaluations.

01:35.835 --> 01:37.557
Held up.

01:37.577 --> 01:42.904
Yeah, as an example of a positive way to do it, where we,

01:42.884 --> 01:55.375
for years and years have required annual evaluations with feedback to the individual, in many cases with peer input.

01:56.076 --> 02:01.200
I think most of our departments have gone to that and some have done it for a number of years.

02:01.701 --> 02:11.389
What are the key factors in terms of teaching research and service and et cetera?

02:12.685 --> 02:20.355
Our model is pretty broad, and the key factor to answer it in the simplest term is what have you contributed?

02:22.037 --> 02:34.953
If you're going to max the system, then you would have undoubtedly contributed in enhancing scholarship in your discipline and the visibility and the reputation of the college in the process.

02:35.594 --> 02:42.422
But I think we've also done a good job by saying what have you contributed in the teaching area as well.

02:42.740 --> 02:49.401
Now, someone who contributes in both those areas should do better than someone who only contributes in one.

02:50.685 --> 02:54.758
But someone who makes a major contribution in teaching should do better

02:55.025 --> 02:59.772
better than someone who hadn't made a major contribution to the college.

03:00.493 --> 03:11.310
And so basically we're looking and asking the very fundamental question is, what have you done to help this college?

03:12.051 --> 03:22.467
Can you give some examples of the outstanding scholars, the outstanding teachers, some names that would be near the top of the deck?

03:22.565 --> 03:22.985
Sure.

03:23.126 --> 03:36.639
I mean, there's a Lynn Berry, for example, in marketing that's an example, or a My Kid, or any number that I can name, that are examples of people who come pretty close to maxing the system in both dimensions.

03:36.799 --> 03:40.763
And then you throw service in, and they fulfill that one, too.

03:42.184 --> 03:50.412
There are people like Carlton Stolle, who are not scholars in the traditional sense and probably are not enhancing

03:50.729 --> 04:05.565
our visibility from a scholarship standpoint but who keep themselves current in the classroom and who consistently do an outstanding job of educating students and you know hopefully any system will

04:05.984 --> 04:10.669
be constructed to recognize the contributions that people like that make.

04:11.930 --> 04:21.159
Who are some of the people you think, some of the faculty or staff members, that the typical undergraduate goes to most often for advice and counsel?

04:22.480 --> 04:35.653
Yeah, there, you know, there are a number of them, and there are some in each department, but there are a few that really stand out, and I'll make a point about that, too.

04:36.595 --> 04:50.854
that one thing we've discovered the last few years, last several years, is that there's some outstanding talent and contribution to be made from people not on the tenure track.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.117
We have hired full-time lecturers.

04:53.237 --> 05:01.408
We have done, I think, a really good job of making them a part of what we're all about.

05:02.910 --> 05:06.535
We treat them as faculty members in every sense of the word.

05:07.291 --> 05:23.663
They carry an extraordinary teaching load and we don't expect scholarship effort from them, but they have just been outstanding contributors to our college.

05:24.217 --> 05:36.216
And for example, two of the people that are in that category that if you were to stop a student in the hall and say, hey, do you know these people and what do you think?

05:36.236 --> 05:39.782
You know, invariably they'd say, oh, they're great.

05:39.802 --> 05:41.685
And if I've got a problem, I'd go see them.

05:42.020 --> 05:47.367
One's Ben Welch, who is a lecturer in management.

05:47.427 --> 05:50.091
He's now directing our Center for Executive Development.

05:50.311 --> 05:54.857
Another is Linda Perry in accounting.

05:56.479 --> 06:06.272
Both have won university awards for teaching as lecturers, nominated by this college.

06:07.450 --> 06:23.198
You know, there's a George Fowler in the Information Systems Department and, you know, could go through just any number of people.

06:24.072 --> 06:29.622
There's no way that we reward them adequately for what they do.

06:29.842 --> 06:33.649
It's obviously not money that motivates them.

06:33.669 --> 06:36.173
They just have a genuine concern for the students.

06:36.975 --> 06:43.346
What are some of the legendary gateway courses in business that all majors have to take?

06:44.388 --> 06:46.131
Well, accounting...

06:46.583 --> 06:54.597
Accounting is one that some people either find it really easy or for some it's like a foreign language.

06:55.639 --> 07:01.169
And certainly the introductory finance course, I think.

07:01.369 --> 07:03.533
These are sophomore courses or freshmen?

07:03.553 --> 07:08.261
Well, the accounting sophomore and the finance is a junior level.

07:08.742 --> 07:11.427
We don't offer any business courses to freshmen.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.396
And we like that.

07:13.417 --> 07:18.294
We like for them to get a good liberal arts and science base.

07:18.354 --> 07:22.328
And we're happy not to see them very much until they're juniors, really.

07:22.780 --> 07:32.575
They'll take four business courses as sophomores and then they sort of show up and they're here full time when they're juniors.

07:32.896 --> 07:46.898
But, you know, those are courses and then if you want to be an accounting or finance major, intermediate accounting is sort of like comparative anatomy for pre-med students.

07:48.700 --> 08:04.478
I learned in Missouri, where they have the great journalism program, first one ever in the world, and you can't go to the J school until you have 60 hours plus, and you must have a 3.0, period.

08:05.158 --> 08:09.783
And included in that 60 hours, so much of this, this, this, and this.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.126
And that sure did work well.

08:13.152 --> 08:23.129
And then they could, if they didn't get their number that they desired, they could make exceptions and let in two or three with a two nine or a two eight.

08:23.890 --> 08:29.119
But they were able to put that number at whatever they thought was the number they could handle.

08:29.403 --> 08:37.533
and the 3-0 would normally get a little less than the number that they could handle, and then they'd add a few on.

08:38.093 --> 08:40.096
That is an outstanding program.

08:40.136 --> 08:42.739
I mean, I've heard about that program for years there.

08:44.561 --> 08:44.961
Let's see.

08:46.403 --> 08:50.668
In sending forth proposals, describe the process

08:50.648 --> 08:53.474
of something that you wanted to do.

08:54.255 --> 08:56.660
What happened after it left the college?

08:57.863 --> 09:00.148
Where did the key decision get made?

09:02.473 --> 09:09.467
Yeah, I guess this building is one that comes to mind.

09:13.295 --> 09:23.964
It seems like to me from a strategic standpoint, if you've got a major proposal, that the decision's going to be made in the provost and the president's office.

09:24.725 --> 09:38.056
And that the job of the dean is to help shape that decision in every way possible, or to make it an easy for them to see the appropriate solution.

09:38.937 --> 09:42.880
And so what we always try to carefully document

09:43.568 --> 09:50.020
proposals and to show why it's a good investment and why it's a good decision.

09:50.280 --> 10:03.585
Sometimes we obviously do better than others at that and sometimes we feel like that what seems to us is pretty evident is perhaps less true for others.

10:03.565 --> 10:13.446
But essentially, if the president and the provost don't support something, then it's a very difficult proposition.

10:13.486 --> 10:17.554
And so we feel that's the first selling job that we have to do.

10:18.055 --> 10:21.041
How did this building come about?

10:21.422 --> 10:24.308
Did you all start the proposal?

10:24.794 --> 10:31.845
We did, and it really started with making a presentation to the building committee on campus.

10:32.005 --> 10:36.432
About how long did it take from that presentation to moving in?

10:37.093 --> 10:37.855
A lifetime.

10:38.896 --> 10:40.719
It was years.

10:41.280 --> 10:45.807
I mean, you know, obviously years, but it was like two years before...

10:46.327 --> 10:51.051
the approval came in and then it was three years, so about five years.

10:51.512 --> 10:56.957
What's the process of getting a building into the priority list?

10:57.557 --> 11:11.390
At least at this time and at the time we did that was really just making the case to that committee and documenting it.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.393
You know, and essentially our case was

11:14.660 --> 11:27.902
One, that clearly we're a college that's grown dramatically and has grown equally dramatically in terms of its reputation and its visibility.

11:28.803 --> 11:36.195
Two, that peer schools, comparable business schools all have their own facility.

11:36.817 --> 11:49.009
And three, by the way, if you give us this building, it's going to solve a lot of other problems for you because with all this space we're vacating over there on the middle of campus, there are people lined up to take it.

11:49.069 --> 11:52.378
And frankly, I think that was an attractive part of our proposal.

11:52.747 --> 11:55.991
that they saw a lot of ways to use that space.

11:56.672 --> 11:57.734
So it worked out well.

11:58.735 --> 12:03.522
And internally, what was the planning process?

12:04.883 --> 12:08.328
How did the guts of all this, how did it get put together?

12:08.889 --> 12:14.757
We put together a committee that included some administration, but mostly faculty.

12:14.837 --> 12:22.467
Had a faculty chair, Don Hellriegel at that time was not in administration and chaired the

12:22.750 --> 12:45.315
committee representing from each department and from each major center and really laid out their priorities and what they felt like they needed and then totaled it all up and came back and cut where we had to cut and really then dealt with the architects on a very close basis.

12:45.295 --> 12:46.979
We love this building.

12:47.039 --> 12:48.322
I mean, it's a great building.

12:48.382 --> 12:51.289
And, you know, I give the architects a lot of credit.

12:51.330 --> 12:58.547
The one thing that we said to them that they were able to visualize, that all we could do was put it in words.

12:58.647 --> 13:02.697
But I remember the first meeting we had with them, I told them that

13:02.677 --> 13:11.446
that when I had visions of our building, it would be something that would blend academic and corporate, that we were a business school.

13:11.466 --> 13:13.888
You know, and I think they captured that really well.

13:14.208 --> 13:19.153
You know, from that notion that they did a really good job.

13:19.253 --> 13:27.481
What were the toughest issues in terms of actually resolving about this building?

13:27.521 --> 13:29.143
What were the toughest issues to deal with?

13:29.283 --> 13:31.165
Well, you know, you never have

13:31.145 --> 13:50.993
the space that you want and and so obviously this this kind of allocating out space and to try to make sure that everybody got their basic needs and and then this really some of the the trade-offs on on space and and

13:52.357 --> 13:57.905
You know, is it better to have four more faculty offices and one less classroom?

13:58.005 --> 14:02.592
Or, you know, how many conference rooms do you need and how many offices in this?

14:03.092 --> 14:10.543
You know, there weren't any single issue that was really traumatic, but just a lot of little things.

14:10.623 --> 14:14.529
And people entered it in a good spirit.

14:14.549 --> 14:20.237
I mean, you know, not that we didn't have on that committee some interesting discussions.

14:20.690 --> 14:39.576
But, you know, it turns out probably the one department that got the worst deal is my department, and that's marketing, because just the way that the design of the building and the space requirements worked out, marketing ended up on the second floor.

14:39.910 --> 14:43.256
and all the other departments are on the third and fourth floor.

14:43.776 --> 14:57.098
And it turns out that the second floor is the only place in the building where, one, the windows leak, and that, two, you don't have a pretty nice view because it overlooks the roof of the auditorium or the big classroom in this building.

14:57.860 --> 15:03.589
So when I leave the dean's job and return to my department, I'm going to pay the price for having...

15:03.991 --> 15:07.195
not looked out for them like I should have.

15:08.998 --> 15:23.637
Other than that, in terms of the planning, whether by the committee or the architect, what has worked best and least well in this building?

15:24.781 --> 15:29.268
Most of the functional parts of this building have been this first rate.

15:29.929 --> 15:34.036
I would say what has worked best are the classrooms.

15:34.116 --> 15:38.804
They were technologically state-of-the-art, and we've kept them that way.

15:38.964 --> 15:42.570
We've made huge investments in them since then.

15:42.550 --> 15:45.134
They lend themselves very well.

15:45.214 --> 16:00.956
The design of the first floor is such that there can be literally thousands of students here going to class and you don't get the sense of being overwhelmed with people, whereas in the blocker building you felt like you were in a Grand Central Station kind of environment.

16:01.176 --> 16:02.418
So that's worked very well.

16:02.458 --> 16:06.904
The offices for the most part have worked well.

16:07.070 --> 16:20.003
You know, I would say that like a lot of university buildings, probably the least desirable part is we don't have enough general purpose kinds of space.

16:20.123 --> 16:32.115
If we have something special going on or, you know, need to have a reception or something, there's, I mean, but that's a reasonable kind of trade-off.

16:32.399 --> 16:38.049
And this, if we were redoing it, they're like keeping the carpets clean.

16:38.069 --> 16:48.147
I mean, I think I would insist upon having the stone floor that we have in part of the first floor throughout the whole first floor.

16:49.730 --> 16:52.333
But, you know, those are really minor complaints.

16:53.254 --> 17:02.443
I've dealt with a lot of academic buildings in my career, and there is no academic building that I've ever been involved with that comes close to this.

17:02.463 --> 17:06.026
I mean, it's five years old, and it doesn't look five years old now.

17:06.607 --> 17:11.031
What about access for faculty in terms of parking and so forth?

17:11.071 --> 17:11.952
That's been fine.

17:12.733 --> 17:15.736
We'd like to have covered parking, especially this time of year.

17:16.176 --> 17:18.859
And, you know, we're just sitting out in the open out in the sun.

17:19.295 --> 17:24.302
And mentioning parking, let me tell you a little anecdote about the parking.

17:24.663 --> 17:38.062
We did something that I have not seen done in many academic settings is that when we were doing our parking lot and designing the parking lot, we told the parking people that we wanted no reserve places.

17:38.403 --> 17:41.868
It's a controlled access lot and it's first come first serve.

17:41.908 --> 17:45.994
If I get here last in the morning, I park at the back of the lot.

17:46.379 --> 17:52.832
And, you know, I'll tell you, everybody, there's always a place to park out there, and that's not a problem.

17:52.852 --> 18:01.408
But like, and we insisted that the custodial staff be giving places, and so they get here at 4 o'clock in the morning and their cars are on the front row.

18:01.990 --> 18:02.751
And, you know,

18:03.102 --> 18:05.266
THAT HAS REALLY WORKED WELL.

18:05.466 --> 18:06.869
I THINK IT SENT A MESSAGE.

18:06.949 --> 18:12.259
WE'VE GOT A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTODIAL STAFF IN THIS BUILDING THAT'S THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.282
WE HAVE A LUNCHEON FOR THEM TWICE A YEAR.

18:14.623 --> 18:21.415
THEY REALLY WORK HARD TO KEEP THIS BUILDING IN FIRST RATE SHAPE.

18:21.935 --> 18:25.699
Telling them, hey, if you get here at four in the morning, you park where you want to.

18:25.739 --> 18:32.907
And this new building, I presume, has helped in fundraising and recruitment?

18:34.108 --> 18:35.449
Oh, enormously.

18:35.630 --> 18:36.931
Can you give some examples of?

18:37.251 --> 18:50.085
Well, I think, one, when we bring faculty in, I mean, you know, there are so many examples of faculty that we've had, potential faculty that we've had here interviewing that have remarked.

18:50.065 --> 18:52.650
how impressed they are with the building.

18:52.770 --> 18:59.442
So there's no question they view this from a physical environment standpoint very positively.

19:00.704 --> 19:12.445
I think in terms of the external, you know, it's my observation that our former students and corporate supporters are like everybody else,

19:13.032 --> 19:20.323
They like to feel like that there's going to be a payoff for their support, that we all like to support winners.

19:21.545 --> 19:29.978
And I think the building is this part of the package that we have, the ratings and, you know, all the textbooks our faculty have written.

19:30.058 --> 19:34.265
In fact, our students do such a great job when they recruit them and so forth.

19:34.445 --> 19:38.972
All that goes in this building all go into the package that, hey, this is a program

19:39.458 --> 19:46.226
that's a high quality program and that they can make good use of our support.

19:47.428 --> 19:49.310
I think it all goes together.

19:51.292 --> 20:05.449
And as the plans were being formulated and they went up through the campus and then the system and so forth, what were the key questions that were asked beyond the college?

20:05.783 --> 20:11.056
Well, particularly when it got to the regents level, the key question is, where do we put it?

20:11.598 --> 20:13.001
And there were some real differences.

20:13.041 --> 20:13.863
You mean location?

20:13.924 --> 20:14.766
Location-wise.

20:14.786 --> 20:17.312
Where do we site it?

20:17.933 --> 20:22.040
And, you know, frankly, our biggest concern was just give us the building.

20:22.501 --> 20:28.832
And, you know, we had obviously some opinions, and it ended up being at our first choice site.

20:29.272 --> 20:37.326
But there was at least one regent, Mr. Weisenbaker, who really wanted the building to be over by engineering.

20:37.998 --> 20:42.926
And, you know, Mr. Weisenbaker was a man who didn't mince his words and would tell you what he thought.

20:42.986 --> 20:55.866
And in an open meeting where we were discussing this, I mean, he said, you know, said, hey, these are two premier colleges, and I want, you know, I want business.

20:56.127 --> 20:58.230
He was a big supporter of engineering, as we know.

20:58.270 --> 21:05.001
He said, I don't, I like business being over there with engineering where they do some things together, and I don't want them moving over there with all those ag people.

21:05.791 --> 21:07.875
Where would he have put it?

21:08.255 --> 21:19.755
He would have put it across university from where engineering is, that space there across the street from where the old Albertson store is.

21:20.396 --> 21:22.900
That was his, Cherry Hill, I think it's called.

21:23.141 --> 21:27.428
That was his first choice, or Apple Hill, or whatever it is.

21:27.408 --> 21:36.104
And, you know, of course, if we had nightmares of all the pedestrian traffic, there would have to be crossing university and so forth.

21:36.124 --> 21:41.755
But nobody ever mentioned going due east from engineering into where there is a parking lot.

21:42.005 --> 21:42.666
Oh, yes.

21:43.387 --> 21:43.567
Oh, okay.

21:43.587 --> 21:52.539
Yes, but very quickly we were told that there would be no buildings built in that area, and there have not been.

21:53.080 --> 22:04.435
In fact, engineering's building, chemical engineering building, and that was their first choice, and they were, you know, so that's going to be preserved as a non-building area for whatever reason.

22:04.415 --> 22:14.130
But so, you know, where it would be located, and once it was decided, seriously talked about locating, and Mr. Weisenbaker, I mean, he was not unreasonable about this.

22:14.170 --> 22:16.233
That was just his first choice.

22:16.253 --> 22:28.752
But once we decided to have it over here, then a number of questions about how you get students back and forth, because suddenly we're talking about moving 6,000 students from one part of the campus to another.

22:29.255 --> 22:38.048
And it was really, you know, I think we had a lot to do with the decision to go to 20 minutes between.

22:38.168 --> 22:45.920
I think it would have happened anyway, but certainly we speeded that along to go 20 minutes between classes instead of 10.

22:47.863 --> 22:49.044
And it's worked, incidentally.

22:49.145 --> 22:54.773
There have been some inconveniences, but it's worked pretty well.

22:55.327 --> 22:55.950
over here.

22:56.654 --> 22:59.408
I don't hear, it's not a major issue with the students.

22:59.428 --> 23:03.750
There's still a lot of parking, relatively speaking, over in this part of campus.

23:05.131 --> 23:07.957
I think the medical school was the one that hated to see us.

23:07.977 --> 23:09.439
I mean, they had a great deal here.

23:10.482 --> 23:21.163
They were over here by themselves, and we were kind of the new neighbors moving in and messing up the neighborhood, bringing all these people and cars and everything.

23:21.744 --> 23:25.992
And I'm assuming that business does not have any...

23:25.972 --> 23:31.999
closest academic relationship neighbor on the campus.

23:32.039 --> 23:35.723
There's no other college that y'all work with more than any other, is there?

23:36.044 --> 23:38.086
Well, you know, Mr. Weisenbaker was right.

23:38.126 --> 23:42.090
We probably do work with engineering more than any other.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.775
We provide some courses for some of their programs.

23:47.336 --> 23:54.865
But we've also had some continuing education relationships with Vet Med and some other colleges.

23:55.250 --> 23:58.854
You know, we work some with a lot of the colleges, but you're right.

23:59.214 --> 24:10.826
Unlike, say, the sciences and ag or vet med that work very, or math and engineering, we don't have any of those kind of relationships.

24:11.086 --> 24:22.017
And I'm assuming that the typical business major comes here hoping to major in business, that there's not a high bunch of transfers from one college

24:22.621 --> 24:28.969
I'm sure historically, I mean, you know, the old jokes about engineering is pre-business.

24:29.067 --> 24:40.002
Yeah, that historically that was probably true, but it's so difficult to transfer into business now that for the most part, if they do want to get in business, they have to be admitted on the front end.

24:42.225 --> 24:42.605
Let's see.

24:43.727 --> 24:48.313
I presume that in terms of this building, legislators didn't get involved.

24:49.655 --> 24:57.505
And did you and the executive committee that helped to plan this, did they work directly with the architect?

24:58.227 --> 25:06.938
Well, theoretically we worked through the facilities planning operation and we were probably the most aggressive

25:07.475 --> 25:15.965
group that they have ever dealt with in terms of insisting upon maintaining a direct contact with the architects.

25:17.066 --> 25:27.919
I'm not sure that that was their first choice, but it was clear that we were bound and determined to do that, and I think it greatly contributed to the success of the finished product.

25:28.379 --> 25:32.444
And the funding for the building was Puff Available Fund?

25:32.464 --> 25:33.465
Right.

25:33.445 --> 25:38.113
And in terms of original estimates and the actual cost, how did that come out?

25:40.818 --> 25:51.317
We actually ended up with a completed building that was, as I recall, $1.3 million less than what it was supposed to cost.

25:51.718 --> 25:55.605
And what about timing?

25:57.003 --> 26:10.699
We had hoped to get in in time for the fall semester of 95, and we ended up getting in in December of 95, but it was always optimistic to think that we could be in before then.

26:10.819 --> 26:17.007
So essentially it ended up, you know, at that time the building boom was known like it is now.

26:18.228 --> 26:24.816
Share some experiences about everybody moving in, some plus and minus experiences.

26:26.011 --> 26:33.212
Well, I frankly was surprised at how well it went.

26:33.753 --> 26:37.945
And it was over the holidays and

26:38.330 --> 26:39.752
We moved in first.

26:39.812 --> 26:47.042
The dean's office moved first because we had students finishing up finals over in the other building.

26:47.282 --> 26:50.166
And so consequently, the academic departments couldn't move.

26:50.226 --> 26:52.649
So we were actually over here by ourselves.

26:53.691 --> 27:00.119
And this building was designed as an energy-efficient building where all the lights operate by sensors.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.544
And it was an enormous feeling of power

27:04.182 --> 27:16.504
That you would enter this huge hallway on the first floor where there would be almost totally dark except for the emergency lights and that that and nobody else in the building because there were only like

27:16.602 --> 27:18.384
you know, eight or nine of us over here.

27:19.005 --> 27:26.996
And so we would walk the building and have these lights popping on as we would walk through and it was quite a feeling.

27:27.737 --> 27:31.101
But the move went very well.

27:32.823 --> 27:38.331
You know, nothing really unexpected, no real disasters.

27:39.272 --> 27:44.719
It ended up costing us a lot more money to leave Blocker than we thought because at that time for our

27:45.256 --> 27:53.331
chairs, we had mounted these big bronze plaques on the wall, and we had no idea they were gluing them to the wall.

27:53.792 --> 28:03.130
And so when we left, much to liberal arts dismay, there was this whole long wall with this series of what appeared to be homemade cut windows.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.874
interior wall that we had to pay to replace.

28:08.355 --> 28:18.132
So there were a few humorous incidents like that, but for the most part things went well, the phones worked, and we were really very pleased with how well it worked.

28:18.152 --> 28:21.318
And new furnishings for offices here.

28:22.019 --> 28:27.649
That's a policy with new buildings for the most part is they will not let you take old furniture.

28:28.186 --> 28:37.128
One, the people moving into your space where you're moving out needs something, but that's sort of part of the building.

28:37.589 --> 28:43.343
Did you leave anything sentimentally that you would have brought for sentimental purposes?

28:43.778 --> 28:49.730
There was almost nothing in the dean's suite in the blocker building that I would have developed any similar attachment.

28:51.874 --> 28:56.323
This looks like a pleasant setting in terms of dimensions.

28:56.744 --> 29:00.091
It's not huge, but it looks very adequate.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.496
Oh, it's great.

29:02.476 --> 29:05.841
You know, and our department head offices are very nice.

29:05.901 --> 29:13.974
They have one room, but they have room for a small round conference table in them.

29:14.034 --> 29:17.019
And, you know, very adequate.

29:17.159 --> 29:17.780
We're full.

29:17.820 --> 29:22.888
Of course, we've received now Regent's approval to add a wing onto this building.

29:23.549 --> 29:25.592
And this building was designed for a wing.

29:26.173 --> 29:26.273
Okay.

29:26.776 --> 29:30.620
and sort of run right out toward the horticulture building.

29:30.680 --> 29:34.524
It should, when it's finished, look exactly like the rest of the building.

29:35.325 --> 29:38.007
And what will it house?

29:38.027 --> 29:53.323
Well, it'll house, we'll add seven classrooms, including a 225-seat room, and it'll house the home for our Reliant Energy Trading Center, which is an exciting, where our students will actually

29:53.793 --> 30:16.155
have a training for, and then they'll have a new networking lab for information systems, and then a number of offices, and we'll move all of our graduate operation there, all of our graduate advising office and the administrative offices, and it'll be what we refer to as the graduate wing.

30:17.097 --> 30:24.030
Now when you arrived, was there a full array of graduate degrees available?

30:24.511 --> 30:27.718
Yeah, all the degrees were in place.

30:27.758 --> 30:33.268
They've certainly grown some, but no, we had a full range master's through doctoral.

30:33.549 --> 30:38.278
So you've not had to go to the coordinating board for any new degree approval?

30:39.457 --> 30:50.910
We've had to go to them a couple of times for new options, and we had an executive MBA that did require their approval, but we've really had no difficulty.

30:51.271 --> 31:00.722
I think that they've been natural extensions of our programmatic offerings for a comprehensive flagship university.

31:00.702 --> 31:16.427
All right, when you arrived and perhaps on to the present, what other institutions have you had personally as the model that you want us to strive to be like or more competitive with?

31:17.248 --> 31:22.356
Well, you know, this is often not totally popular to say this.
