00:01.887 --> 00:12.660
One of the interesting things, I don't know, do you 
remember what George Bush Drive looked like

00:01.887 --> 00:12.660
before we made the street out of it? We got ready to 
build that and Mr. Greer, who was a state highway

00:14.983 --> 00:29.160
engineer, gave me $500,000 to build that street 
and didn't charge it to my Farm to Market Road

00:30.322 --> 00:40.018
program because he had a love for A&M and he's a 
graduate of 1926 or somewhere back there. So I went

00:40.038 --> 00:46.568
to Mr. Rutter and I told him that I had money to 
rebuild Jersey Street from Highway 6 over to the

00:40.038 --> 00:46.568
railroad. That's as far as the first part of it 
went. This was to take it from two lanes to four

00:49.573 --> 00:52.017
lanes. Well, two lanes from nothing to something. 
And that's part of my story. Mr. Rutter called me

00:59.022 --> 01:06.452
and asked me, said, what's going to be your design 
on, called it Jersey Street at that time. And I

01:07.433 --> 01:17.547
said, Mr. Rutter, we're going to build four 
running lanes, two parking lanes, and a

01:07.433 --> 01:17.547
continuous 16-foot left turn center lane. You 
can't do that. I come, you're going to take too much

01:19.930 --> 01:22.333
of my campus. He said, build it like the road over 
there by the railroad. And I said, no, sir, we're

01:27.681 --> 01:30.572
not going to build nothing like that. Well, you 
think about it some more. I said, that's going to

01:33.202 --> 01:35.952
take an awful lot of the campus. So he called me in 
about two, three weeks, and he said, what did you

01:37.771 --> 01:42.095
decide about Jersey Street? And I said, four 
running lanes, two parking lanes, and a 16-foot

01:42.155 --> 01:46.660
turn lane. He said, I told you, you got to cut that 
down. I said, Mr. Rutter, we're not going to spend

01:52.005 --> 01:56.069
any money out there if we can't build it right. So 
the thing rocked along, and he called me about

01:58.231 --> 02:04.858
three or four weeks later, and he said, have you 
been talking to any of my board members? I said, Mr.

02:06.273 --> 02:08.899
Rudd, I don't even know any board members. He said, 
well, the last board meeting they told me, they

02:10.002 --> 02:15.515
said, when they get ready to build Jersey Street, 
don't let them build it too narrow. I said, I don't

02:18.161 --> 02:22.411
know who he was, but he's my friend. So... you see 
what we built, and it's not wide enough. But at that

02:27.333 --> 02:29.275
point, then, did he did agree? Oh, yes. Oh, another 
thing, he said, they're going to take his soccer

02:30.757 --> 02:32.959
field. You know, the soccer field is where, I 
guess, the former student building is now. I said,

02:40.225 --> 02:43.048
you can build a soccer field anywhere on this 
campus. And then we got ready to go from the

02:44.649 --> 02:48.193
railroad over to the airport. See, there wasn't 
any road there at all. That was a pasture. And we got

02:52.342 --> 03:03.162
the thing laid out, and we were working with a 
fellow, but it seemed to me like his name was

02:52.342 --> 03:03.162
Langdon or Langston or something, who was head of 
the utilities department out there. And there was

03:04.244 --> 03:08.832
power lines and fence lines and water lines. So we 
began to tell him that he had to move a bunch of that

03:09.622 --> 03:17.932
stuff and he was dragging his feet and he wouldn't, 
he just wasn't moving. So I called Mr. Rutter and I

03:18.913 --> 03:23.398
said, Mr. Rutter, we can't get any clearance out 
there. I said, we got power lines, water lines, and

03:24.259 --> 03:28.584
a bunch of stuff to move. And I said, they're just 
dragging their feet. And I said, you wanted that

03:32.148 --> 03:34.110
thing done. He said, well, come out and tell me what 
you need. And so I took my resin engineer and went

03:36.885 --> 03:39.108
out there. And he said, just give me a list of what 
you want. When you want the power line moved. And I

03:43.916 --> 03:46.640
said, oh, three weeks or whatever we told him. And 
water line, sort of the same. And he said, OK, what

03:48.342 --> 03:52.128
else? And I said, that's it. He said, well, I'm 
going to Europe. O.D. Butler called me the next

03:56.935 --> 03:58.577
week. And he said, what in the hell did you tell Mr. 
Rutter? And I said, well, I just told him we had to

04:03.284 --> 04:06.289
get that stuff moved. He said, he called me and he 
said, you get out there and you get that stuff moved

04:06.329 --> 04:12.158
right now. O.D. Butler was moving the fence the 
next week. And Haskell, it wasn't any time till he

04:17.506 --> 04:22.574
got that thing, he got that thing clear. He could 
move things. And then we got ready to build the West

04:26.641 --> 04:28.684
Loop. And he called me and Fort Albritton and, oh, I 
don't know, there was some of the county people.

04:40.257 --> 04:45.464
They had built one little end on the north end of it 
from Highway 21 up. The county had built a little

04:45.484 --> 04:48.467
short stretch. And he told me, he said, we want 300 
feet around there, so if you ever make it four lane,

04:48.487 --> 04:56.297
we don't have to get additional right of way. And 
the university is going to give the county

05:00.170 --> 05:07.082
whatever right of way they need, and pointed to Mr. 
Allbritton, and he said, Ford, and you're going to

05:00.170 --> 05:07.082
give what the need down. He owned a bunch of it out 
there, about this intersection. You know where

05:12.111 --> 05:15.598
Allbritton, the Linn Co. used to be? Yeah, yeah. 
That was Ford Allbritton. Sure, sure. And he owned

05:18.623 --> 05:21.368
then on out where the... And Ford said later, I 
didn't know you were gonna put an interchange out

05:22.006 --> 05:27.733
there and we've got the world the right way. But he 
told Ford, you're gonna give that. And so he, man,

05:32.278 --> 05:36.463
he could move stuff, I'm not kidding you. Of all the 
presidents you have observed, to which one at A&M,

05:37.344 --> 05:48.638
I'm not gonna ask the negative, to which ones would 
you give high grades? Which presidents did the

05:48.658 --> 05:50.680
best job? Well, as far as I was concerned, I guess 
it'd be Rudder and Williams. That's the two that I

05:55.414 --> 05:58.477
dealt with a whole lot. Give some examples of your 
work with Dr. Williams. Well, the first real

06:02.821 --> 06:17.595
encounter I had with him, I

06:02.821 --> 06:17.595
don't know why, but I was out to a football game or 
something, or we'd had something before the

06:02.821 --> 06:17.595
football game, and I had my uniform on. And we were 
walking along and met a man and woman and two little

06:20.039 --> 06:24.085
kids. And I spoke to those little kids and the 
little boy was excited that he got to be a general

06:25.127 --> 06:32.579
officer. And they told Mr. Williams about it for 
some reason. I think they knew him or I can't tell

06:36.344 --> 06:39.750
you. And he called me up and complimented me for 
stopping and putting my hand on that little boy.

06:47.933 --> 07:00.469
And then we had two or three, there was two or three 
other road deals that he was involved with that I

06:47.933 --> 07:00.469
decided that he was a pretty nice fellow to work 
with. Now during your day, was there discussion

07:00.490 --> 07:04.295
about moving the railroad? No. See, when I was in 
there, it used to be two railroads. And we put them

07:10.603 --> 07:11.965
on one. And that took 20 years. To go over to the west 
side of the campus, you had to go up and climb up over

07:15.305 --> 07:29.064
the railroad like this and you couldn't see what 
was on the other side because there wasn't much

07:15.305 --> 07:29.064
over there. And that was one of the oldest, we 
called it an IPE as a study job that the highway

07:30.546 --> 07:40.840
department had was to get rid of that bad crossing. 
And there was an A&M graduate who was the chief

07:42.457 --> 07:49.846
engineer for the Southern Pacific Railroad in 
Houston. And he's really the one that got that

07:51.327 --> 08:01.739
thing moved and we were able to put both of them, the 
highway department paid for putting those

07:51.327 --> 08:01.739
railroads together and building that underpass. 
And he was responsible for that. And so we worked a

08:06.946 --> 08:10.810
long time to get them on one railroad. And I don't 
think I'm ever going to see any part of that

08:12.494 --> 08:16.600
railroad moved. I agree with you very much. I know 
I'm not going to. You may, but I'm not going to live

08:21.907 --> 08:25.031
that long, I don't think. And I really, Askel, I 
really don't think it's as big a problem as a lot of

08:26.553 --> 08:34.624
people think it is.

08:37.748 --> 08:38.890
I agree, I agree. Well, let's see. We added this 
after the Aggie, what feelings you carry in your

08:41.750 --> 08:50.500
heart for A&M. What do you hope, let's conclude 
with this, what do you hope A&M's future is? What do

08:58.630 --> 09:00.392
you want A&M to be in the future?

09:03.536 --> 09:07.020
Oh, I don't know that bigger is better.

09:08.570 --> 09:26.187
I just hope that A&M can continue to carry the 
tradition it's got, have the leadership that is

09:08.570 --> 09:26.187
interested in it progressing and keeping the 
great name that it's got now. That's a good

09:27.590 --> 09:28.772
conclusion.
