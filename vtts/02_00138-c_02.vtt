WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:05.231
I'm running than you do in the high hurdles. And 
technique is not nearly as important. What is

00:09.136 --> 00:12.680
important is power and speed. So I got through the 
Border Olympics. I won, as I said. And then we got

00:19.408 --> 00:23.634
ready for the Texas Relays. I busted up my knee on a 
curb and was in the hospital at the time the Texas

00:24.535 --> 00:32.164
Relays came about. So we get ready for the Kansas 
relays, which is toward the end of April. And I'm

00:41.139 --> 00:48.489
still nursing a sore knee. And I qualified for the 
finals, but I didn't place. So we go to the Drake

00:53.356 --> 00:55.319
relays. We have a snowstorm. There's about four to 
six inches of snow on the ground. We come out for the

01:04.760 --> 01:06.524
preliminaries. Bob Hall, who's a teammate, 
Southwest Conference record holder in the low

01:07.727 --> 01:13.862
hurdles. And Billy Bless, teammate, classmate, 
and I were entered in the low hurdles. I was also

01:22.851 --> 01:25.315
entered in the high hurdles. This is the first or 
the second big major outdoor carnival. And this

01:31.403 --> 01:40.035
attracted a lot of schools from the Midwest, an 
awful lot of them. I actually placed third in the

01:40.977 --> 01:44.100
high hurdles in that. That was a kind of a junior 
NCAA type meet. And I was very pleased with that.

01:51.286 --> 02:10.242
And we had the low hurdles and Bob Hall did not 
qualify for the finals in the low hurdles because

01:51.286 --> 02:10.242
the track was so sloppy from all of that snow and 
they had tried to broom it off with a rotary broom

01:51.286 --> 02:10.242
and then they poured diesel fuel on it and set it on 
fire. to try to burn all the moisture out of there.

02:13.184 --> 02:14.967
It just made an absolute mess. And poor old Bobby, 
he was too short legged. He couldn't quite stretch

02:20.295 --> 02:22.959
it to that ninth hurdle. And he hit it and he went 
tumbling and he was out of the race. Well, it didn't

02:27.326 --> 02:28.407
bother me. I was, you know, I was like an old mule in 
mud. I was getting going. Come time for the finals,

02:35.258 --> 02:38.743
I'm lined up against the NCAA champion from Notre 
Dame, Bill Fleming. Fleming gets the middle lane.

02:47.144 --> 02:57.093
I got the inside lane, which is all chewed up, 
sloppy, and I have to run more curves than anybody

02:47.144 --> 02:57.093
else because I'm on the inside. Gun went off, I took 
off, and somehow or other, I got a two-foot lead and

02:58.434 --> 03:05.020
held it. And one of the drake relays What a nice bull 
of a watch for him. And then we went to the

03:12.165 --> 03:15.148
conference meet. And I won the high hurdles in the 
conference meet and placed third in the load held

03:15.989 --> 03:25.279
in Austin that sophomore year. And I was also, I won 
the Doc Lipscomb award, MVP award for that year.

03:35.990 --> 03:37.772
Did y'all go to the NCAA then? I did not. We sent a 
team. Our first child was due at that time. So I

03:47.238 --> 03:55.168
thought it prudent for my own survival that I stay 
home for that event, and I did. I did go, however, to

03:55.188 --> 04:07.084
the National AAU track meet at College Park, 
Maryland on

03:55.188 --> 04:07.084
the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of June. 1950 and the 
Beaumont A&M Club and Charlie Babcock paid my way

04:07.655 --> 04:34.708
up there and I stayed the first night with Tiger 
Teague and his wife and young Jack Teague and then

04:07.655 --> 04:34.708
the second night I moved out to a dormitory at 
College Park and I was third in the high hurdles

04:07.655 --> 04:34.708
there up hills of Marin and White. What was your, 
you remember what your best time was that year?

04:41.658 --> 04:54.037
Yeah, my best time in high hurdles was 14.5 at the 
conference meet, and 22, 23

04:41.658 --> 04:54.037
flat in the low hurdles. Let's sidetrack. 
Describe Olin Teague, who was then a young, new

04:55.759 --> 05:02.890
member of the U.S. Congress from this district. 
That's not easy to do. I met him. Mrs. Teague met me

05:08.711 --> 05:11.676
at Washington National Airport. How nice. And of 
course he was in committee meetings and Congress

05:12.879 --> 05:20.473
was in session.

05:22.850 --> 05:25.753
As a matter of fact, he didn't even make it home for 
dinner that night. Now, he was a comparatively

05:26.734 --> 05:30.058
small bundle of energy, wasn't he? Yes, he was. And 
boy, he was buzzing around everywhere.

05:34.383 --> 05:35.043
Vivacious.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.569
I just wasn't exposed to him that much. I spent 
maybe 10, 15 minutes with him at the moment. Mrs.

05:46.676 --> 05:48.778
Teague was a very gracious lady. All right. Your 
junior and your senior, well, as you're a young

05:51.723 --> 05:57.929
married man, did you go on court trips? Sophomore? 
No. Sophomore, junior, you didn't go on court

06:00.231 --> 06:02.754
trips. But you all went to Silver Taps and to 
Muster. Did you go to midnight yell practices?

06:09.881 --> 06:10.241
Yes. Where were they held? Midnight yell practice 
was held. West side of the Y or the Grove? They were

06:20.545 --> 06:23.369
held on the steps of Goodwin Hall. Goodwin, OK. And 
they were not at midnight yet, were they? No. They

06:28.737 --> 06:31.121
were just called midnight yell practice. They 
were held around 9 or 10 o'clock at night. That's

06:34.506 --> 06:36.649
right. And did the yell leaders tell fables then? 
Oh, yes. They'd get up there and tell great tales of

06:40.295 --> 06:45.503
heroics. And the individual football player 
would get up there. And they would tell stories.

06:52.370 --> 06:58.057
But later there would be some of the fables would be 
off color. But was that done in your era? No. That's

07:01.241 --> 07:01.902
what I thought. That's a new thing. No.

07:08.410 --> 07:09.872
I've forgotten how Lizzie went. But it was done in a 
deep bass voice. And the punchline was Son of a gun,

07:17.127 --> 07:18.609
Lizzie. And it was, oh, I remember how it went.

07:27.158 --> 07:29.381
Is my lipstick on straight? Loan me your comb, 
sweet cherry phosphate. Son of a gun, Lizzie. It

07:37.470 --> 07:40.453
was a holdover from World War I in those days. Now, 
there was a put-down Aggie yell for every

07:40.513 --> 07:46.780
Southwest Conference opponent, wasn't there? A 
kind of a spoof?

07:51.835 --> 07:53.377
More of a kush call than a yell. OK, OK. We,

07:53.698 --> 08:04.535
as far as put downs go, no. The only put down that we 
had was beat the hell out of them. OK. Was there, by

08:08.963 --> 08:14.792
that point, were Aggies yelling gig'em? You bet. 
Because I understand that way back in the 30s,

08:17.885 --> 08:25.558
there was a yell, what do you do with those frogs? 
You gig them. Very likely. And that Pinky, I

08:29.444 --> 08:34.292
understand, deserves credit for kind of taking 
that. Gig them, gig them, gig them. I believe that.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.763
And I do too, given his personality.

08:42.262 --> 08:51.471
And so you and your wife and then your youngster, 
y'all would go to y'all practices and to bonfire.

08:51.491 --> 08:52.052
We would. And things like that. We would. Let's 
see. Getting on to your junior year, how did it go

08:59.479 --> 09:06.065
with a young track man? Well, my junior year, we 
were finally able to get an apartment. The Brenham

09:13.497 --> 09:29.516
A&M Club had an old World War I barracks building 
that they had moved about a block behind Southside

09:13.497 --> 09:29.516
Grocery, where Rother's Bookstore is now, on 
Montclair. And they made it into four apartments,

09:30.617 --> 09:35.262
two upstairs, two downstairs. And there was a bath 
up and a bath down, and you shared them. And they

09:41.476 --> 09:49.807
were three-room apartments, a bedroom, a living 
room or study, and a kitchen. And we thought that

09:51.008 --> 09:54.112
was just uptown. Unfurnished. Unfurnished. You 
had to have your own furniture. And Betty's mother

09:59.519 --> 10:05.667
had a large three-story house, and she had rented 
out rooms, so that was not a problem. And her mother

10:06.528 --> 10:10.032
and father loaned us that furniture. Remember 
what the rent was? $20 a month, which included the

10:11.550 --> 10:16.356
utilities. There was a telephone, and we all split 
the telephone bill. And if you made a

10:22.744 --> 10:34.378
long-distance call, then you settled up at the end 
of the month with Oscar Bockhorn, who was the dorm

10:22.744 --> 10:34.378
meister. And we had a great time. It was wonderful. 
We didn't know we were poor. We still didn't have a

10:44.583 --> 10:45.965
car. We got around by bicycle. We had friends who 
had cars and they were more than generous about

10:49.350 --> 10:54.837
inviting us to go with them. Go to a drive-in movie 
or go to the Triangle and we would reciprocate

10:55.718 --> 11:03.489
whenever we could. And those were good years, 
really good years. It was good academically and

11:10.120 --> 11:13.485
athletically. And you didn't have any severe 
problem that you had to cope with where you had to

11:14.406 --> 11:22.997
turn to Colonel Andy or somebody for advice about 
what do I do now? Nobody got badly sick? No. No car

11:26.903 --> 11:28.144
wrecks? We were very fortunate and still are to 
this day. Alright, so junior year, does it go well

11:31.749 --> 11:35.594
athletically? Junior year went well 
athletically. With one exception. There was a

11:42.232 --> 11:44.294
fellow named Val Joe Walker. He was a football 
player and a track man. He was a sprinter. He'd run

11:53.142 --> 11:55.023
109.6, 109.7. Val Joe also learned how to hurdle. 
He had been a hurdler, but he didn't really know

11:59.628 --> 12:03.591
how. He didn't have the technique. And somebody 
got him aside and taught him how to hurdle. And he

12:09.942 --> 12:12.084
started giving me problems. Oh, was he an Aggie? 
No, he was from SMU. Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah,

12:15.348 --> 12:17.230
yeah, yeah, yeah. And he had a deformed left hand. 
It looked about like that. He had no fingers. But he

12:29.604 --> 12:34.450
was one heck of a football player and a good track 
man, too. And he and I traded wins that year. And I

12:41.671 --> 12:50.741
remember sports writers used to try to goad us into 
saying bad things about each other. And Battle Joe

12:52.363 --> 13:00.733
had run a 14-1 in the high hurdles with the win. And a 
sports writer from the Houston Post contacted me

13:06.946 --> 13:12.132
asked me what I thought about that and what my 
chances are in the Southwest Conference meet. And

13:13.473 --> 13:17.899
I said, well, he's going to have to run 14-1 to beat 
me. Well, son of a gun if you didn't do it. And he

13:22.163 --> 13:28.030
knows me out by about two feet. In the conference? 
In the conference meet. And we had traded wins back

13:30.553 --> 13:35.839
and forth in the high and the low hurdles all that 
year. And Billy Bless moved up from, all of a sudden

13:36.207 --> 13:43.634
he learned how to sprint in the 220. And I was still 
going my same speed. If the track got wet or sloppy,

13:48.479 --> 13:51.782
I'd take him. But on a good dry track, on a good day, 
he just had too much speed for me. And he won the

13:58.788 --> 14:03.353
conference meet that year in the lows in 23 flat. 
And I finished third. Bobby Joe Ragsdale, who was

14:06.464 --> 14:09.248
also a sprinter. They kept getting these 
sprinters and teaching them how to hurdle them. I

14:13.234 --> 14:14.255
thought that was unfair. All right, now by this 
time, the Korean War was underway. Do you remember

14:20.745 --> 14:24.070
how you heard about the start of the Korean War? Do 
you remember? I was at the National AAU Track Meet

14:24.610 --> 14:31.240
at College Park, Maryland, on the 25th of June. It 
was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I had just

14:37.015 --> 14:41.262
finished the high hurdles, was getting ready to 
run the low hurdles. And the PA announcer came on

14:42.343 --> 14:55.903
the horn and said, we have a report here that the 
North Koreans have invaded South Korea, wherever

14:42.343 --> 14:55.903
that is, is the way he put it. He says, that's all we 
have at this time. And I thought, oh, boy. You know,

15:04.021 --> 15:10.728
here I am ready to be a junior, ready to get my 
contract for senior ROTC. I got a wife and a kid. And

15:14.312 --> 15:17.676
the kid's two weeks, less than two weeks old. And 
what's going to happen? Did you and your buddies

15:22.302 --> 15:25.245
talk about those realities then? Yes, we did. We 
certainly did. And...

15:31.835 --> 15:58.753
we all decided that a few who were borderline 
academically decided what the heck I'm tired of

15:31.835 --> 15:58.753
this and they went ahead and enlisted or whatever 
and

15:31.835 --> 15:58.753
joined the Army, the Navy, the Air Force a lot of 
them went in the Air Force that seemed to be the

15:31.835 --> 15:58.753
service of choice at that time Now, did the, at that 
point, do we have officially the Air Force or was it

15:59.611 --> 16:08.082
still the old Army Air Corps? No, it was Air Force. 
Okay. Ever since Truman signed the National

16:10.665 --> 16:17.975
Defense Service Act of 47, we've been Air Force. 
All right, and so. We even had the

16:19.137 --> 16:24.083
Bulls. had the new Air Force silver tan uniform. Of 
course, we wore the Army pinks and greens. A

16:30.915 --> 16:32.778
beautiful uniform. Back here at A&M, then, you 
were in an Air Force company? No, I was still in B

16:38.567 --> 16:40.450
athletics. Oh, you were still in B athletics.

16:45.677 --> 16:48.822
What led you to decide to seek a contract?

16:51.434 --> 16:53.577
I had a private pilot's license. I started flying 
when I was in high school. Okay. And I always wanted

16:56.921 --> 17:00.104
to fly. Okay. And of course the Universal Military 
Training Act had been voted by Congress in 48 while

17:00.305 --> 17:13.200
I was still in high school. And it was just a 
foregone conclusion that you were going to go in

17:14.221 --> 17:18.186
some branch of the service. And particularly with 
the Korean War going on, I was going to fly

17:22.045 --> 17:25.849
airplanes. And they just got new jets. And that was 
where I wanted to be. And I don't know that my wife

17:32.617 --> 17:38.004
ever expressed any misgivings about it. 
Everybody accepted that was the way life was going

17:38.544 --> 17:43.370
to be. And you just made the best of the hand you were 
dealt. Now you went to summer camp after Never went

17:52.606 --> 17:53.628
to summer camp. Oh, really? The class of 52 did not 
go to summer camp because it was the height of the

17:54.289 --> 18:02.100
Korean War. And the Texas A&M students did not 
because they figured they're just as good as

18:03.182 --> 18:14.379
academy students, or nearly as good. The academy 
students didn't think that. But we did not go to

18:16.882 --> 18:19.947
summer camp. Oh, okay. So let's go then to your 
senior year. Y'all stay in this apartment. Yes.

18:29.273 --> 18:32.517
And you're still with that same major. You're 
still planning to be an insurance man. Still

18:35.500 --> 18:38.524
business, still insurance. Okay. And Colonel 
Andy is still the head coach? He still is. Okay. Did

18:45.752 --> 18:49.596
he ever give you, during those four years, Did he 
ever give you any clear do's and don'ts? Don't do

18:53.932 --> 18:56.536
this, and you must do this, this, this? No. Like, 
did he ever tell you don't smoke? No, he left that up

19:03.205 --> 19:05.048
to us. I never heard him say anything about smoking 
or drinking one way or the other. He knew that that

19:12.018 --> 19:18.587
was going on, and as long as it wasn't a problem, He 
didn't choose to make it a problem. In your era, if

19:22.246 --> 19:35.604
we had been able to compare the average grade point 
score of the track team with the student body at

19:22.246 --> 19:35.604
large, how would they have compared, reckon?

19:38.748 --> 19:40.530
Beat the socks off of them. Is that right? In my 
class of 52, six of the top 10 Students were

19:46.917 --> 19:50.062
Letterman athletes. Including you and who else? 
Gerald Natardis was the valedictorian. He was a

19:57.213 --> 20:02.381
Letterman and honorable mention in football. 
Marvin Atkins was not an athlete. He was a

20:07.509 --> 20:10.373
salutatorian. I was number three in the class.

20:17.157 --> 20:18.518
I've forgotten who was number four. Glenn Lippman 
was number five football player, all Southwest

20:19.459 --> 20:24.364
Conference. Hilo Novovitsa was number six or 
seven, all Conference guard. And that's

20:33.994 --> 20:40.980
six. No, no, that's not six. Trying to think of who 
the other one was. I'll think of it in a minute. As

20:48.515 --> 20:53.422
far as you were aware, were there any special grade 
giveaway courses for athletes? No. Not for

20:56.387 --> 20:57.348
athletes. You had Dr. Dan Russell. Dr. Dan. Dr. 
Dan, the grade point man. If he can't pass you,

21:04.218 --> 21:06.201
nobody can. But that was for anybody that took the 
course. Yeah. You know, if you needed some grade

21:10.313 --> 21:13.437
points, you'd go take rural sociology. Was there, 
were there any courses that were so tough that

21:13.937 --> 21:21.766
everybody was scared to take that course from 
that? There was thermodynamics, differential

21:23.248 --> 21:33.740
calculus,

21:23.248 --> 21:33.740
descriptive geometry. They would separate the 
men from the boys. Were there some courses that

21:37.347 --> 21:43.557
everybody took just because they were pleasant, 
that they were enjoyable? A few. I took a course in

21:46.542 --> 22:00.925
the New Testament in the spring of my sophomore 
year because I wanted to learn more about it. Do you

22:00.945 --> 22:01.887
remember who taught it? No, I don't. It was an 
assistant pastor at First Baptist Church up at

22:03.251 --> 22:08.277
Northgate. Classes were held there. And

22:12.362 --> 22:24.976
I took Rural Sociology under Dr. Dan simply 
because I wanted to find out what it was about. Now,

22:25.878 --> 22:29.061
was it easy to make it? Exceptionally easy. It was? 
It was almost comical. It was,

22:36.015 --> 22:44.546
well, the title of this particular rural 
sociology course was Marriage and the Family. I

22:44.566 --> 22:49.172
thought, well, maybe he'll teach me something I 
don't know that I need. And it was just your usual

22:50.413 --> 22:55.139
SOP stuff. But everybody loved Dr. Dan. We need to 
quit. Because it's ten minutes to six. Is it? I've

23:05.082 --> 23:06.364
been yakking for that long. No, no, no, no. I'm not, 
I'm not, don't hear me. But I need to let you go. And

23:11.032 --> 23:18.605
then, now

23:11.032 --> 23:18.605
we're checking, checking, checking to see if it's 
working today.

23:21.069 --> 23:21.850
Is mine working? This is now Friday, March 9th. And 
we're continuing. When we left off yesterday, we

23:29.363 --> 23:50.417
were getting near the finally important matters, 
but before we get to those, would you describe some

23:29.363 --> 23:50.417
of the very notable athlete individuals that were 
here during your four years in all the sports?

23:53.562 --> 23:54.223
I'll start with of those guys. Who was your closest 
track team buddy? My closest track team buddy

24:02.101 --> 24:13.173
would have been Buddy

24:02.101 --> 24:13.173
Schaefer from El Paso. Buddy is now a practicing 
dentist. He may not be practicing any longer, he

24:16.457 --> 24:26.488
may be retired, but he became a dentist and moved 
back to the El Paso area.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.604
The track team manager, T.K. Burke, was another 
very close friend. T.K. went into Marine Corps

24:35.131 --> 24:41.000
aviation and made a career out of the Marine Corps. 
Give some examples of the friendship of you and

24:41.521 --> 24:45.567
those guys. What did you all do together and what 
did you share and so forth? We palled around

24:51.075 --> 24:56.543
together quite a bit, particularly on track 
trips. And an interesting story about Buddy

24:57.147 --> 25:09.759
Schaefer, and it has to do with Kyle Roach, Doak 
Walker, and Harry Stiteman.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.843
SMU was playing us here in 1949. Buddy Schaefer was 
a sophomore, and he played substitute halfback

25:16.125 --> 25:25.053
and did our kickoff. Mm-hmm.

25:28.501 --> 25:37.650
And we were tied with SMU,

25:28.501 --> 25:37.650
I believe, 14 to 14 and a half. And Stitler called 
Schaefer over. We were going to kick off to SMU. And

25:45.557 --> 25:48.820
of course, Walker and Roach were deep for SMU. And 
Stitler told Buddy, he says, Schaefer, whatever

25:49.801 --> 25:56.888
you do, don't stick it to Walker. Okay, Coach, I got 
you. So he kicks it to Rope. Rope takes it on the

26:02.167 --> 26:08.052
one-yard line and goes 99 yards for a touchdown. 
And Stidler called Schaefer over the sideline and

26:08.072 --> 26:13.497
grabbed him by the shoulder pad. He says, 
Schaefer, what the hell did you kick it to Rope for?

26:18.542 --> 26:21.925
And he says, Coach, all you told me was not to kick it 
to Walker. And eventually we got close to SMU. But

26:28.137 --> 26:30.019
they finally beat us. And that year, I think we won 
one game. I believe it was either Trinity or Texas

26:36.066 --> 26:38.609
Tech. I'm not sure. And we lost nine. Other

26:44.095 --> 26:52.845
special athletes? Special in my class, 
particularly, was Buddy Davis, Walter Davis from

26:53.467 --> 26:59.574
Nederland, Texas. Buddy was 6'10", 6'11", and he 
high jumped. And he had been using the scissors

27:08.664 --> 27:16.132
method of high jumping, which was not a very 
efficient method. And Colonel Andy taught Buddy

27:16.152 --> 27:22.039
to do the western row and the barrel row. The 
western row you would do kind of on your back, very

27:22.677 --> 27:28.685
similar to the Fosbury flop that's in use today. 
And he also did the barrel row where he would go over

27:29.907 --> 27:38.058
with his chest to the bar. But he made dramatic 
improvement from his sophomore year to his junior

27:40.401 --> 27:50.655
year after Colonel Andy got him into the western 
row and barrel row area. And... He was a good

27:52.563 --> 27:53.624
friend. I had played basketball against him when 
he was at Meadland and I was at Walmart High. As a

27:58.970 --> 28:12.065
matter of fact, I scored five straight baskets on 
him from, yeah, I was playing at the top of the key

27:58.970 --> 28:12.065
and I used a fadeaway hook shot without even 
looking at the basket. It baffled him and

28:13.126 --> 28:18.833
surprised the heck out of me. I figured I was going 
to get his big hand down the back of my neck. But I was

28:23.649 --> 28:39.324
there at SMU in 1952 at Only Field when Buddy

28:23.649 --> 28:39.324
set a new world record for about 20 or 30 minutes. 
And one of the rules of the course was that there

28:40.505 --> 28:51.055
could not be more than one half of an inch variation 
in the takeoff apron in front of the bar. And they

28:53.507 --> 29:03.476
found one edge way out on the fringe that wasn't 
being used that was about an inch higher than the

28:53.507 --> 29:03.476
bar. And they couldn't submit it for a record. So it 
went from seven feet down to I think it was 6'11".

29:14.787 --> 29:16.889
The world record at that time was 6'11 1⁄2". But 
Buddy eventually got the record later on and of

29:20.498 --> 29:47.552
course he won the olympic games that year in 52. yes 
now was he a classmate yes so he he won the olympics

29:20.498 --> 29:47.552
in the summer after he graduated that's correct it 
was in helsinki he and dara hooper represented

29:20.498 --> 29:47.552
texas a&m and the united states and dara hooper 
finished second in the shot to perry o'brien he and

29:20.498 --> 29:47.552
perry dueled throughout their collegiate 
careers. And Perry always came out about one or two

29:50.467 --> 29:57.575
inches ahead of Darrow, but Darrow was a real 
competitor and a good friend. Now, Darrow was from

29:58.276 --> 29:59.798
Fort Worth? He was from Northside, Fort Worth. A 
stater. And he and his young bride, he married at

30:02.761 --> 30:15.936
the tail end of, I believe, between his freshman 
year and his sophomore year. His wife and Betty and

30:16.642 --> 30:22.968
I piled around together quite a bit, and we had a 
great time. They were good friends. Now, Darragh,

30:25.791 --> 30:27.933
did he play football also? Yes, he did. He came out 
of Northside-Fort Worth as a quarterback. He was a

30:34.138 --> 30:35.700
big, tall guy. He was 6'3", and he weighed about 215 
or 220. Beautifully built man, and of course, when

30:41.165 --> 30:45.349
he got here, He was a little bit out of his league as 
far as the quarterback was concerned. But they

30:50.951 --> 31:00.305
made an end out of him, and he could shag good pass, 
play good defense, and more importantly, he was a

30:50.951 --> 31:00.305
place kicker. And he kicked the field goal that 
beat Texas here in 1951. That kind of thing. Let's

31:11.080 --> 31:13.443
see, other athletes. Some of the other athletes, 
some of the upperclassmen of note and good

31:18.269 --> 31:25.242
friends, George Cadera, who was a white man.
