WEBVTT

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:08.879
Petroleum Engineering Building, and I won't jump ahead to our senior year.

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:11.802
But y'all drilled on?

00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:26.460
We drilled on the Harrington Field, I guess it is now, and we'd have final reviews, and we'd have Mother's Day programs, and we'd have Parents' Days, you know.

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:39.809
During the class day, if you and a buddy had any spare time, unscheduled time, where did you go?

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.351
What did you do?

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:44.936
I don't remember having a lot of unscheduled time.

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:49.883
It seemed to me like you had enough homework to keep you busy.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:56.178
And as a freshman, the upperclassmen were going to keep you quite busy also.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.983
Where could you go hide out and do your homework?

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:02.005
At the library.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:10.795
And most of the guys were pretty reasonable and recognized that you did have to do your homework.

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:15.280
I don't think there were many times that I

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:22.646
I would have to ask to be excused from any task so that I could get my homework done.

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:30.955
I don't think the homework was too much.

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.499
I don't think it was overcrowding us on our time.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.644
We were not allowed automobiles and that sort of thing.

00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:45.030
So in the freshman year, you did some hitchhiking, but not a whole lot.

00:01:45.652 --> 00:01:52.741
Now, on a Saturday night, if you and your buddies didn't have anything scheduled, where did you go for fun?

00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:55.284
Well, we might play poker.

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:56.645
In the room?

00:01:57.046 --> 00:01:57.527
In the room.

00:01:58.047 --> 00:02:00.110
Would money ever be involved?

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.291
Money would be involved.

00:02:01.692 --> 00:02:03.574
Well, that was not approved, was it?

00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:09.381
It was not approved, and boards were not approved, and you weren't supposed to get caught.

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:15.437
And so I guess we took an attitude that if you don't get caught, whatever you do is okay.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.505
That's not a healthy way to look at life, but anyway, maybe it is, I don't know.

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.928
That first fall, do you remember a court trip?

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:26.329
Yeah.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.331
Where?

00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:35.419
First fall we went to Fort Worth and marched it down.

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:39.127
parade before the TCU game.

00:02:39.808 --> 00:02:40.549
How'd you get up there?

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.853
Or do you remember?

00:02:45.053 --> 00:02:45.994
I don't recall.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:50.138
Might have had a ride from a buddy.

00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:56.184
I remember Austin Dance had a motorcycle, and we'd go motorcycling with him.

00:02:57.585 --> 00:03:00.608
But we mostly hitchhiked wherever we were going.

00:03:00.628 --> 00:03:02.470
But on a court trip, I believe we

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:06.500
had to be organized to where we would be sure of getting there.

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:12.508
Now, that first semester, did you attempt to go home at all during that fall?

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.389
Yes.

00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:15.873
No, I did not.

00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:18.977
And how did you and your family communicate?

00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:20.439
By mail.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.390
And Mom was always sending cookies or something like that, too.

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:34.006
Where could a fish hide the cookies to keep others from eating them up?

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:42.799
Well, I guess you'd hire them in your shoes, I mean hide them in your shoes.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.307
Later on we would hide our boards in the walls.

00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:54.917
You'd take the medicine cabinets out of the wall and put the boards inside the wall, put the medicine cabinets back.

00:03:55.572 --> 00:04:01.381
Of course the bulls, the inspectors would always find us from time to time.

00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:05.608
Now let's see, that fall A&M had a good football team.

00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:09.414
Oh my word, yeah, unbeaten.

00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:16.144
I think we were unbeaten for 18 straight games into our freshman sophomore game, too.

00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:20.331
As far as you know, did those football players go to class and take real courses?

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.830
Yes.

00:04:23.152 --> 00:04:27.759
As far as I know, they had to do well academically.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:28.821
Where did they live?

00:04:30.123 --> 00:04:30.603
All over.

00:04:31.024 --> 00:04:31.224
All right.

00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:32.046
They were scattered out?

00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:33.087
They were scattered out.

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:37.094
They didn't have a later athletic dorms.

00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:37.895
They didn't have that.

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:41.020
Did they have a training table or did they eat with their outfits?

00:04:43.413 --> 00:04:44.414
I don't recall.

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:45.837
I don't recall.

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:47.419
I think they ate with their outfit.

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:51.304
Do you remember going to your first football game or so?

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:53.067
Oh, yeah.

00:04:53.127 --> 00:04:53.788
What was it like?

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:55.510
Describe the football Saturday.

00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:57.393
Oh, it was great.

00:04:57.473 --> 00:05:00.898
You marched in, as they still do.

00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:07.648
We'd have a date and maybe we'd meet at the old Aggieland Inn.

00:05:08.455 --> 00:05:15.269
And maybe Mom would approve of us or not approve of us, and then we'd take our date to the football game.

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:19.258
Did your family come up here during that first fall?

00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:19.959
Did they drive?

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.362
I believe they came once.

00:05:22.003 --> 00:05:25.872
Did you have a date from home at that time?

00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:27.976
No.

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:28.978
All right.

00:05:30.578 --> 00:05:36.465
Well I went home the first time from being in A&M to meet my girlfriend there.

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:38.748
I think I was already a sophomore.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.732
And I met my date.

00:05:42.152 --> 00:05:43.254
I didn't meet my date.

00:05:43.474 --> 00:05:53.987
I saw her at the Fort Sam Houston Officer's Club jitterbugging with another guy, and I didn't know how to jitterbug.

00:05:54.322 --> 00:06:02.798
Emily Beth was a great gal, but she sure could dance around me like I didn't know what I was doing.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.808
All right, your first semester you did okay in your academics.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.511
Except for that.

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:10.854
Except for the English.

00:06:10.874 --> 00:06:11.215
English.

00:06:12.597 --> 00:06:17.106
And spring semester, you never thought about changing your major.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.044
Never did.

00:06:19.104 --> 00:06:31.083
And as the war gets more and more serious, what did you do after that freshman summer?

00:06:31.103 --> 00:06:31.844
Did you go home?

00:06:33.346 --> 00:06:35.049
Oh, that freshman summer.

00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:39.696
Gosh, I don't remember my freshman summer.

00:06:39.716 --> 00:06:41.999
You didn't go to summer camp, I don't think, did you?

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.942
No, we did not go to summer camp.

00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:46.907
So I guess...

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.644
I guess I must have gone home, but I won't recall.

00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:56.026
You don't remember what your job was?

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.309
I don't remember what my job was.

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:03.774
Do you have any idea what it cost to go to A&M in that time?

00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:08.539
Well, I always recall everybody saying the tuition was 50 bucks and that was it.

00:07:09.841 --> 00:07:11.823
I also took in cleaning and pressing.

00:07:13.044 --> 00:07:17.569
I'd get a nickel for a pair of trousers and a nickel for

00:07:17.768 --> 00:07:28.503
a shirt that I would carry down to the cleaners that was above the old bookstore.

00:07:29.605 --> 00:07:31.067
You got a nickel for carrying them?

00:07:31.227 --> 00:07:40.461
I got a nickel for each item that I took to the cleaners and brought back and gave back to the upperclassmen.

00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:45.548
Did you bring with you some spending money or did your parents give you?

00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:51.257
My dad sent me some money from time to time and I knew he had a hard time giving it to me.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:57.009
So I saved my money pretty much from the cleaning and pressing.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.459
And what kind of enjoyable things did you spend that money on?

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.283
Hitchhiking.

00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:15.197
We'd hitchhike to Houston and we'd hitchhike to Waco and we'd hitchhike to San Antonio and we did very well in hitchhiking.

00:08:15.477 --> 00:08:17.920
Share some hitchhiking stories that you remember.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:32.376
Well, the horror stories are when you got picked up by a guy who had been drinking and he put his hat over the speedometer and put his foot all the way to the floor

00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:39.721
And this guy passed on the left on a car that was already passing, or he'd pass on the right.

00:08:40.783 --> 00:08:44.590
And I don't know how I survived that particular ride.

00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:55.410
But the guy took me to my home, let me out in my driveway, and I was very thankful to be alive.

00:08:57.685 --> 00:09:04.623
But that was, that was one time it was really... Now, to go from here to San Antonio, what was the route you usually followed?

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:12.403
To Hearn, through Taylor, Rockdale, to Round Rock, to Austin.

00:09:13.126 --> 00:09:14.590
San Antonio.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.472
Okay.

00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:19.522
Did you ever get left somewhere for two or three hours?

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:21.266
Did you ever get stuck badly?

00:09:21.426 --> 00:09:25.817
Oh, we got stuck from the rain from time to time, you know, that sort of thing.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:31.270
I never will forget that my sophomore year, we bought a car.

00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:33.562
Scott Kramer and I bought a car.

00:09:33.622 --> 00:09:37.709
He was in B Battery.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:52.913
But we bought this Model A Ford, and going down to Houston, the ignition caught on fire.

00:09:53.454 --> 00:09:59.383
And we ripped the darn wires out of there to put the fire out, and we did get it out.

00:09:59.887 --> 00:10:03.491
We went on and had a weekend with a couple of gals down there.

00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:11.659
And then coming back, we got picked up by a Prairie View A&M young man.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:18.405
It took us all the way to the East Gate and dropped us off and turned around and went back to Prairie View.

00:10:18.445 --> 00:10:19.106
My, my.

00:10:19.707 --> 00:10:21.689
Us Aggies have got to stick together.

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:22.670
That's what he said.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.712
And that's a true story.

00:10:24.872 --> 00:10:25.613
How good.

00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:26.834
That was really good.

00:10:27.074 --> 00:10:29.016
And that was a very rainy weekend.

00:10:29.907 --> 00:10:30.888
A very rainy weekend.

00:10:30.948 --> 00:10:32.309
What did that Model A cost?

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.770
Do you remember?

00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:39.256
Oh, I think that Model A must have cost us about $50, something like that.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.284
Compare being a sophomore to what it was like to be a freshman.

00:10:48.506 --> 00:10:50.408
Well, it was all the difference in the world.

00:10:50.508 --> 00:10:55.052
I mean, a sophomore had many privileges like all the upperclassmen.

00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:57.855
I mean, we were supposed to get our room

00:10:58.207 --> 00:11:06.575
clean and have breakfast delivered if we wanted that and get them to write a letter to our girlfriends and that sort of thing if we needed it.

00:11:09.298 --> 00:11:12.321
But a sophomore was a pretty well thought of guy.

00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:16.305
And I never will forget the stripes.

00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:22.271
When you became a sophomore, you became a corporal automatically.

00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:25.294
And you might get to be

00:11:26.472 --> 00:11:27.294
A sergeant?

00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:28.657
No.

00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:31.663
A sergeant was part of being a junior.

00:11:32.384 --> 00:11:34.589
You might be a PFC or a corporal.

00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:42.807
And depending upon how many stripes you got, the upperclassmen would give you that number of licks.

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:47.316
So if you were a corporal, you got two licks from each of your upperclassmen.

00:11:47.802 --> 00:11:57.235
And I never will forget this one upperclassman that had a class and he didn't get there during the time that we were supposed to get our stripes.

00:11:57.756 --> 00:11:59.298
We'd just call those lick stripes.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:10.333
And oh, I don't know whether I ought to say the names or not, but at any rate.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.873
He came in two hours later, and we were pretty cold.

00:12:15.754 --> 00:12:16.955
And that is painful.

00:12:17.816 --> 00:12:19.318
Let me tell you, that is painful.

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:22.701
And then my mother saw my rear end.

00:12:25.364 --> 00:12:29.187
And the San Antonio A&M Mothers Club went up in smoke.

00:12:29.508 --> 00:12:30.829
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:31.830
Caused lots of trouble.

00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:37.235
Now, the A&M Mothers Club was already strong.

00:12:37.676 --> 00:12:40.118
In San Antonio, particularly, that I knew of.

00:12:40.823 --> 00:12:49.563
But they didn't like the fact that my rear end was pretty well red and maybe a little blood streaming here and there.

00:12:49.964 --> 00:12:55.677
And you all had a San Antonio club here on campus.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.323
I don't recall ever.

00:12:59.343 --> 00:12:59.663
Oh, really?

00:12:59.743 --> 00:13:05.810
I was assuming that you all had one where you'd get together and share rides and that sort of thing.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.431
Not really.

00:13:06.691 --> 00:13:07.833
OK. Not really.

00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:12.939
Describe the A&M student body of that era in general.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.004
What were their attitudes, their values?

00:13:17.144 --> 00:13:19.067
What kind of families did they come from?

00:13:19.127 --> 00:13:26.035
Well, all of them, in my view, were very serious minded.

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:28.835
And they all wanted to get an education.

00:13:29.796 --> 00:13:31.378
And they all wanted to get a job.

00:13:32.439 --> 00:13:34.402
And they all wanted to get married.

00:13:34.802 --> 00:13:36.124
They all wanted to have kids.

00:13:36.845 --> 00:13:38.306
And they wanted the war to be over.

00:13:39.287 --> 00:13:42.712
And so they were very conscientious and serious in their studies.

00:13:43.232 --> 00:13:47.938
And their values, were they liberals or conservatives?

00:13:49.268 --> 00:13:52.633
I believe they were more conservative than liberals.

00:13:53.754 --> 00:13:58.761
And they had come from rich families?

00:13:59.121 --> 00:14:00.283
Not rich families.

00:14:02.186 --> 00:14:06.331
There's no such thing as a common man.

00:14:07.954 --> 00:14:17.807
But most of our classmates were products of architects or

00:14:18.563 --> 00:14:28.191
And was there a mix of country and urban?

00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:29.434
Yes.

00:14:30.089 --> 00:14:36.936
Of course, in the Coastal Artillery, we were more engineering-oriented than agricultural-oriented.

00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:43.742
So we had more of the mechanicals and electricals and petroleum and that sort of thing.

00:14:43.762 --> 00:14:46.765
Now, did you engineers think that y'all were the smarter students?

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:47.546
Sure.

00:14:48.427 --> 00:14:55.894
My dad told me that if I would not take flying,

00:14:57.072 --> 00:15:04.219
then he would allow me to go to school an extra year and get two degrees instead of one.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.325
So I switched from mechanical engineering to mechanical and petroleum engineering.

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:19.353
Because I would get another year of college, and I wouldn't take flying, and I'd get two degrees instead of one.

00:15:19.974 --> 00:15:25.459
Of course, because of the war, we didn't get to take that extra year.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:29.780
And that's why my diploma does not say mechanical engineering.

00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:32.304
My degree was in engineering.

00:15:34.246 --> 00:15:36.509
And so there we were.

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:39.132
We didn't have a commission.

00:15:39.413 --> 00:15:41.355
We had to go to OCS.

00:15:42.537 --> 00:15:49.566
Because of the fact that we didn't get to go to summer camp for two weeks, we went to OCS for three months.

00:15:49.586 --> 00:15:52.830
And it was like freshman year all over again.

00:15:53.603 --> 00:15:58.891
And so it was fairly easy to take because the Aggies had been schooled in freshman year.

00:16:01.074 --> 00:16:02.156
Back to the student body.

00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:12.051
Was there a pretty good mix of students in terms of their ancestry and their backgrounds?

00:16:13.837 --> 00:16:17.321
I think there was a good mix, yeah.

00:16:17.341 --> 00:16:20.084
And did you have a nickname?

00:16:24.029 --> 00:16:24.630
Zorro.

00:16:25.331 --> 00:16:26.152
How did you get that?

00:16:26.612 --> 00:16:29.836
Well I guess.

00:16:30.076 --> 00:16:32.179
I remember the movie Zorro.

00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:32.739
Yeah.

00:16:34.001 --> 00:16:37.465
Well we also had a black hand.

00:16:38.153 --> 00:16:45.900
group in our battery that would make sure you had to get your head shaved at least once a week or something like that.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.402
A black hand?

00:16:47.422 --> 00:16:48.263
A black hand.

00:16:48.323 --> 00:16:54.969
If you didn't get your hair cut properly, the Black Hand Society would come cut it for you.

00:16:58.292 --> 00:17:04.498
But it was quite a cross country.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.572
Mix of disciplines and families.

00:17:07.592 --> 00:17:09.094
Were there Hispanic boys?

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.576
Yes, we had Hispanic boys.

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:13.939
And Catholics and Protestants and Jews?

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:19.265
Catholics and Protestants and Jews and the whole bunch, and we all got along fine.

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:22.829
What was the secret of everybody getting along?

00:17:24.872 --> 00:17:26.333
Being all part of a group.

00:17:28.356 --> 00:17:29.177
We were Aggies.

00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:33.962
And we, in our freshman year, we worked one year for three.

00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:43.885
So we would get the upperclassmen privileges of having our rooms cleaned and being able to eat breakfast in our rooms before going to class instead of going

00:17:44.084 --> 00:17:49.532
And those student nicknames were not a put-down, they were an identifier.

00:17:49.773 --> 00:17:50.333
That's right.

00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:54.380
And some of them lasted forever, didn't they?

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:54.760
They did.

00:17:56.643 --> 00:18:02.272
Let's see, YMCA, what role did it play then?

00:18:03.353 --> 00:18:11.205
Well, that's where we had our Yale practice, of course, on the steps of the YMCA, and we had bowling alleys underneath.

00:18:11.776 --> 00:18:14.699
And when the parents would come, well, we'd bowl with the parents.

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:23.348
And I never will forget one time I bowled better than Mr. Wilton G. Meyer, my roommate's father.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.733
And it just about killed him that I bowled better than he did.

00:18:29.394 --> 00:18:38.543
But at any rate, that was the YMCA, was bowling and yell practice.

00:18:38.573 --> 00:18:42.337
And is that where you got a Coke, a soft drink?

00:18:42.577 --> 00:18:44.119
I guess you could get a soft drink there.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.542
But you didn't have much money to spend on that.

00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:49.164
We didn't have much money for that.

00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:50.726
Where did you go to the movie?

00:18:52.668 --> 00:18:57.012
We went to the movie at the, there was a movie house.

00:18:57.753 --> 00:18:58.674
At the Campus Theater?

00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:00.876
Or at Guyon?

00:19:00.916 --> 00:19:01.537
Which did you?

00:19:01.697 --> 00:19:07.163
It was, I think it was right next to the Aggieland Inn.

00:19:07.717 --> 00:19:13.844
Right about where the memorial, I mean the chapel is now.

00:19:13.864 --> 00:19:15.606
Chapel is now, yeah.

00:19:15.846 --> 00:19:19.370
Did you guys ever cut up anything during the movie?

00:19:19.811 --> 00:19:20.592
Make any noise?

00:19:22.914 --> 00:19:25.097
Oh, I imagine so every now and then.

00:19:25.157 --> 00:19:26.999
Raise a little hill.

00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:30.383
Religious activities.

00:19:30.443 --> 00:19:35.749
Do you remember any chapel, Northgate?

00:19:39.155 --> 00:19:48.612
Well I don't think we were, I don't recall really going to Sunday school.

00:19:48.893 --> 00:19:49.995
What did you do on Sunday?

00:19:51.337 --> 00:20:01.956
Well if I wasn't in Waco or Houston or San Antonio, probably sleep in and maybe go to a movie.

00:20:02.813 --> 00:20:12.304
Let's describe a football, once you're a sophomore or higher, describe a home football Saturday.

00:20:15.628 --> 00:20:16.369
Usually at eight.

00:20:17.871 --> 00:20:22.216
I'd either come in by a motor car or sometimes come in by the train.

00:20:24.459 --> 00:20:26.121
And lunch in Sabeasa.

00:20:27.983 --> 00:20:31.167
And there the underclassmen, like freshmen,

00:20:31.687 --> 00:20:35.673
They learned I could sing, I guess, and I had to sing Wee Bonnie Baker.

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:41.382
And I would sing for some of the dates of our upperclassmen from time to time.

00:20:42.364 --> 00:20:46.470
Like, oh Johnny, oh how you could love.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:57.508
At any rate, then you'd go to the game and then you'd come back and have a dinner.

00:20:58.906 --> 00:21:04.392
Or the date would take off with their parents and go home.

00:21:04.792 --> 00:21:09.617
Now, did the Aggie buy the date's football ticket?

00:21:15.403 --> 00:21:16.104
We must have.

00:21:16.224 --> 00:21:19.187
He didn't pay for her train ticket, did he?

00:21:19.328 --> 00:21:19.608
No.

00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:22.551
They would come down on their own.

00:21:23.105 --> 00:21:25.915
And most of their expenses were paid by themselves.

00:21:26.317 --> 00:21:33.402
Now when they came to a dance, well, or to a football game, how were the dates treated by the Aggies?

00:21:33.905 --> 00:21:35.248
Oh, with great respect.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:46.652
But the Aggie tradition of a kiss after each conversion or touchdown or extra point, that was a very favorite tradition.

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:47.534
That was continued?

00:21:47.815 --> 00:21:48.657
That was continued.

00:21:48.677 --> 00:21:54.529
Do you remember ever any young lady that didn't know about that tradition in advance?

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:59.295
I wondered if there was ever a time when the girl didn't know she was going to get kissed.

00:21:59.315 --> 00:22:00.036
I don't think so.

00:22:00.076 --> 00:22:13.171
As a matter of fact, even with Pat and me, and this is our second marriage, I made sure she was well trained and well educated as to what to expect in a football game.

00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:19.618
There was a young couple in front of us that was named Bradley, and he's a dentist here now.

00:22:19.658 --> 00:22:23.402
He said that they had such a dry spell

00:22:24.631 --> 00:22:28.975
during most of their football time, that they would kiss on first downs.

00:22:31.277 --> 00:22:38.404
See, I went into the service, and I missed out on a lot of football games between graduation and then.

00:22:41.087 --> 00:22:41.667
Let's see.

00:22:41.887 --> 00:22:44.870
In your days, were the Yale leaders important people?

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:45.451
Were they?

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:47.052
Very much so.

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:48.994
They were Yale leaders.

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.175
They weren't cheerleaders.

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:54.199
And they got out in front of the group, and they

00:22:54.787 --> 00:23:04.898
They made sure everybody understood what the hand signals were and we learned how to yell and we learned how to hump it and we learned how to grab a pooch.

00:23:05.502 --> 00:23:07.745
and all those other good Aggie traditions.

00:23:08.326 --> 00:23:15.716
Now, other than the Longhorns, in your day, who was the opponent that A&M most wanted to beat?

00:23:16.397 --> 00:23:17.579
Other than the Longhorns?

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:19.702
Other than the Longhorns.

00:23:19.722 --> 00:23:22.746
The Longhorns were the main ones, of course.

00:23:22.766 --> 00:23:28.033
That's where I saw my first defeat was by the Longhorns.

00:23:28.975 --> 00:23:31.661
We had 18 straight games winning.

00:23:32.463 --> 00:23:41.382
And we were headed for the Rose Bowl until they threw a long 57-yard pass.

00:23:41.851 --> 00:23:51.445
in the first 57 seconds of the game, and the Aggies failed to score after that.

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:52.286
What did you all think?

00:23:53.027 --> 00:24:01.439
It was the first time we stayed in the stands and cried, which I thought was terrible, but everybody did it.

00:24:03.181 --> 00:24:04.483
Yeah, Lordy.

00:24:05.324 --> 00:24:08.973
That was a very sad time when we lost those turns.

00:24:09.635 --> 00:24:16.633
To answer your question, I guess the second most

00:24:18.335 --> 00:24:22.879
not admired team were the Owls.

00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:28.324
The Rice Owls?

00:24:28.364 --> 00:24:28.905
Rice Owls.

00:24:29.145 --> 00:24:30.967
Any reason for that that you can think of?

00:24:31.247 --> 00:24:36.052
Well, because of that mob marching up Owl Band.

00:24:36.092 --> 00:24:41.036
They weren't very respectful to us, and so we weren't very respectful to them.

00:24:41.757 --> 00:24:46.261
And I recall a mump epidemic.

00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:48.223
I think we were sophomores.

00:24:49.064 --> 00:25:06.921
And a bunch of the guys broke out of the hospital and went down and stole the rice owl and then came back and got back in the hospital and then they were sick from not knowing what they were supposed to do.

00:25:07.622 --> 00:25:09.984
What they were supposed to not do, they did.

00:25:10.044 --> 00:25:16.590
Too much exercise and the mumps went down and some of them had to be operated on.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.394
to relieve that problem.

00:25:19.414 --> 00:25:24.850
Were you ever part of any of those mascot thefts?

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:25.091
Never.

00:25:25.913 --> 00:25:27.558
I was not.

00:25:29.624 --> 00:25:30.105
Let's see.

00:25:31.128 --> 00:25:33.094
Were the scene cadets around in that era?

00:25:35.403 --> 00:25:38.307
I was a member of Ross Volunteers.

00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:42.012
Hold on, let me write that down.

00:25:42.072 --> 00:25:43.474
We'll want to get that in a second.

00:25:44.114 --> 00:25:45.757
What about the Aggieland Orchestra?

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.819
Oh yeah, Russ Hillier.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.241
Was that big time?

00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:50.683
You bet it was big time.

00:25:50.703 --> 00:25:52.005
Russ Hillier was great.

00:25:52.906 --> 00:25:55.770
He played the right kind of music, sure enough.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.973
And we had other big bands.

00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:01.377
Such as?

00:26:04.698 --> 00:26:05.839
Who were they?

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:06.740
Was Tommy here?

00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:08.161
Tommy Dorsey?

00:26:09.162 --> 00:26:11.885
I don't recall Tommy Dorsey, but I know Glenn Miller.

00:26:12.025 --> 00:26:13.747
Glenn Miller, okay.

00:26:14.427 --> 00:26:17.390
I don't recall the others.

00:26:19.132 --> 00:26:23.176
And there was never any kind of problem at an Aggie dance, was there?

00:26:23.776 --> 00:26:24.457
Not that I recall.

00:26:24.477 --> 00:26:25.398
I've never heard of any.

00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:32.845
And the young ladies dressed like queens and were treated like queens.

00:26:32.865 --> 00:26:33.726
That's right.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:58.025
I do recall one time at a dance off the campus on the other side of the Brazos River where a freshman or a sophomore took notice of the fact that the senior had taken off his boots and was dancing on the dance floor without his senior boots on.

00:26:58.045 --> 00:27:00.669
And the freshman or the sophomore did not like that.

00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:03.713
They thought the man should stay in uniform.

00:27:04.233 --> 00:27:06.736
and they had a little altercation there for a while.

00:27:07.857 --> 00:27:12.782
But that was, that dance hall was just across the Brazos River, and I guess there was too much drinking going on.

00:27:12.802 --> 00:27:15.986
Was it near where the Whiskey Bridge place would later be?

00:27:16.506 --> 00:27:20.611
No, this was on – Oh, on West Highway 30.

00:27:21.792 --> 00:27:23.434
That was where Whiskey Bridge – I mean 21.

00:27:23.534 --> 00:27:24.395
It was on 21, yeah.

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:28.499
Just alongside the railroad tracks, just on the other side of the bridge.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.602
But that was not Whiskey Bridge.

00:27:31.763 --> 00:27:34.105
Was alcohol available at that dance hall?

00:27:35.637 --> 00:27:35.998
Beer.

00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:39.647
I don't recall that hard liquor was there.

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:45.242
What was the favorite indulgence of Aggies in your day?

00:27:46.245 --> 00:27:46.525
Beer?

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.972
I guess so.

00:27:49.012 --> 00:27:50.997
What were the popular brands?

00:27:51.668 --> 00:27:52.670
Lone Star.

00:27:55.335 --> 00:27:56.517
Lone Star and?

00:27:56.918 --> 00:27:58.822
Grand Prize and Southern Select.

00:27:59.243 --> 00:28:00.245
No.

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:01.367
Falstaff.

00:28:02.208 --> 00:28:05.695
Falstaff and Lone Star I think were the two big ones.

00:28:07.733 --> 00:28:10.096
The Kahler Pearl.

00:28:10.516 --> 00:28:11.097
Pearl!

00:28:11.537 --> 00:28:11.858
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:28:11.878 --> 00:28:17.364
Pearl Beer and Long Star and Falstaff were the three big ones, I think.

00:28:17.384 --> 00:28:22.130
Now, did Aggies drink much hard liquor?

00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:23.572
Not a whole lot.

00:28:23.592 --> 00:28:24.593
Not a whole lot.

00:28:25.093 --> 00:28:25.734
Did they smoke?

00:28:27.116 --> 00:28:28.818
Not a whole lot.

00:28:28.838 --> 00:28:30.440
If they did smoke, what were they smoking?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.661
Camels.

00:28:34.044 --> 00:28:35.766
I think that was it.

00:28:36.106 --> 00:28:37.588
Did anybody smoke pipes?

00:28:39.307 --> 00:28:42.134
I don't recall anybody that was smoking pipe.

00:28:42.635 --> 00:28:49.774
Now, was it acceptable to smoke in the dormitory?

00:28:50.997 --> 00:28:52.320
Could you smoke in your own room?

00:28:56.384 --> 00:28:58.026
I don't recall.

00:28:58.927 --> 00:29:01.430
I didn't smoke, so I just don't recall.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.412
Was Ed Hardlicker's place yet?

00:29:04.193 --> 00:29:05.154
Oh, absolutely.

00:29:05.354 --> 00:29:08.278
Describe what you remember of Mr. Hardlicker's place.

00:29:08.358 --> 00:29:16.247
Well, it was a place down on Welbon Road on the left-hand side, and you could get a beer down there.

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:21.693
And it's not there any longer.

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:23.235
It was burned down, I guess.

00:29:24.143 --> 00:29:28.408
But Ed Hardlecker, I remember young Ed Hardlecker, too.

00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:30.069
I was in the service with him.

00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:32.792
And he was a fine guy.

00:29:33.113 --> 00:29:36.336
And Hardlecker's was a great place for Aggies to go.

00:29:36.396 --> 00:29:39.339
Did y'all know?

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:41.381
Franklin's was another good place to go to.

00:29:42.342 --> 00:29:43.824
Yeah, where was Franklin's?

00:29:43.844 --> 00:29:44.865
It was out on 30.

00:29:45.205 --> 00:29:46.807
On 30, yeah, out toward the river.

00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:53.374
Did you and your buddies know that drugs existed?

00:29:54.097 --> 00:29:55.800
Did you even know the word marijuana?

00:29:56.862 --> 00:29:57.342
I never.

00:29:58.164 --> 00:29:58.805
I didn't know it.

00:29:58.905 --> 00:30:00.728
I would have been surprised if you had said you did.

00:30:00.788 --> 00:30:03.553
Never did.

00:30:03.573 --> 00:30:18.518
All right, then you come back in the fall of 1941 as a junior, and do you remember where you were on December 7 when you heard the news?

00:30:20.489 --> 00:30:21.250
Yes, I do.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.113
Describe that, please.

00:30:26.619 --> 00:30:43.628
We were in Hart Hall and Ensign Gay came and talked to us about his torpedo bombing in the
