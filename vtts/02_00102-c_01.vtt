00:02.714 --> 00:30.088
some advanced program and we're having more and more students that have placed out of classes in their high school testing where they may be taking the freshman english but they may be taking the advanced engineering classes like this past year there was a 19 year old girl that had got her degree in electrical engineering her master's degree is working on her doctorate which most of the freshmen

00:30.068 --> 00:32.451
And sophomores are 19 now.

00:32.471 --> 00:54.621
But I think if they had one place to go to find their materials or one building complex rather than, I've heard people say, oh, it's so much nicer to do research at A&M than it is at, and they'll mention a university, because you have to go to so many different buildings to find your materials.

00:56.463 --> 00:57.865
I'm on your side on that one.

00:58.064 --> 01:06.552
And I wish that our budget would increase to maybe there are times that we could add a second copy of titles.

01:06.572 --> 01:11.237
There was a time period that we could only add one copy of a book.

01:11.938 --> 01:16.882
And if you have 200, 300 people using that one copy, it's hard.

01:18.124 --> 01:25.231
We have, are trying, and I don't know how we'll be able to do it, a textbook collection.

01:25.311 --> 01:27.733
I know you can't buy all the university textbooks.

01:29.232 --> 01:44.322
But I know you can't buy all the university textbooks because so many books are, it would be nice if we could quote indoctrinate the teaching professors to

01:45.365 --> 01:51.552
Check our collections before they give a bibliography of things for people to read.

01:51.632 --> 01:56.177
Yes, they may have used them at XYZ University where they came from.

01:56.237 --> 01:58.399
That doesn't mean it's in every collection.

01:59.821 --> 02:05.888
And if they're going to make a major assignment, put it on reserve for the students for their help.

02:07.610 --> 02:08.310
I think that would help.

02:08.751 --> 02:13.296
Other advice you would give decision makers about A&M Library?

02:16.246 --> 02:26.800
Keep all the better communication from top down and not let us find out things by the grapevine.

02:28.402 --> 02:39.156
And if there's going to be changes in a department's leadership or they're going to put someone in a temporary position, don't let us find it out by the grapevine.

02:39.436 --> 02:40.718
For example, we...

02:41.491 --> 02:56.565
We had a, our department has training sessions and tries to visit other departments in the library so that we know what's going on because we are, serve as a general information desk as well as a reference desk.

02:57.407 --> 03:00.293
So we visit other departments such as special collections.

03:00.273 --> 03:03.659
and the Policy Sciences Library, we have that coming up.

03:03.699 --> 03:07.486
We visit the West Campus Library business, so we know what they have.

03:08.148 --> 03:16.864
But, for example, we found out one person in one department was going to be in special collections as a special person to build

03:18.565 --> 03:19.346
a collection.

03:20.468 --> 03:25.014
And we found it out when we visited the Special Collections Department.

03:25.174 --> 03:27.557
It had not been announced.

03:27.617 --> 03:32.163
We still don't know what's going to happen to the department where this person resided.

03:33.926 --> 03:43.799
We've just now found out that one of our cohorts is taking a leave of absence and taking her place as someone out of reference.

03:43.819 --> 03:45.301
And so we're kind of left in limbo.

03:45.341 --> 03:46.082
What are we going to do?

03:46.102 --> 03:48.285
Because we're already short people in our department.

03:48.265 --> 03:51.628
And our department head is leaving.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.950
And so we're down two key people.

03:55.972 --> 03:58.374
So let us know what's going to happen.

03:58.434 --> 03:59.735
What can we expect?

04:00.236 --> 04:02.998
What kind of support can we have from the administration?

04:03.018 --> 04:13.508
I think that all departments, they were supposedly, quote, an hours committee where all departments would get together and talk about the hours of service.

04:14.829 --> 04:17.091
And it's not come through.

04:17.915 --> 04:23.887
Our department is the one that is open more than any other department or any other library on campus.

04:25.270 --> 04:32.244
And if they're open later, they're expecting it to come from us rather than other areas.

04:32.805 --> 04:38.877
And I think it should be a uniform hours of operation.

04:39.633 --> 04:42.778
and not depend, everybody else closes and this one does.

04:42.859 --> 04:48.468
Because especially when they don't know the others are closing, that it puts hardship when you send them and they say, well, there's nobody over there.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.115
They're not even there until this afternoon.

04:52.175 --> 04:55.881
And if we knew, that would be one thing.

04:56.562 --> 05:02.232
But take into consideration the use of the building.

05:04.523 --> 05:05.104
Okay.

05:08.949 --> 05:14.938
To whom do you feel most gratitude relating to all these years here?

05:17.221 --> 05:20.246
To whom do you feel grateful?

05:21.307 --> 05:22.769
In the library or whatever?

05:22.789 --> 05:23.110
Anywhere.

05:23.290 --> 05:23.611
Anywhere.

05:27.396 --> 05:32.303
Well, one of the first people I came in contact with was LaBelle Castle.

05:33.464 --> 05:36.126
and she made you learn your reference collection.

05:38.108 --> 05:39.209
I learned a lot from her.

05:39.229 --> 05:49.499
I think Jack Smith and Henry Osmire and Evelyn King really had a relationship with the faculty and the staff.

05:51.201 --> 06:00.349
I have friends that are in, were in, history department that I learned a lot from.

06:02.033 --> 06:15.735
In library school, I had one professor that I learned all my reference from that made it useful, and his theory was if you can't find it, you call somebody that does.

06:16.596 --> 06:19.781
I learned a lot in the history department.

06:19.861 --> 06:22.946
I had, I guess, Dr. Lang.

06:22.966 --> 06:23.247
Just a second.

06:23.267 --> 06:23.367
Okay.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.835
I learned a lot from Dr. Lange in history to make me appreciate the state better.

06:29.636 --> 06:32.619
Haskell Monroe had an influence.

06:32.639 --> 06:33.901
I took classes under him.

06:34.802 --> 06:40.568
And one of the best books I read in his class, Mores and Jarm, was from Plowshares to Petticoats because I could relate to that.

06:41.349 --> 06:44.212
Garland Bayless was another one in history that I learned a lot from.

06:44.712 --> 06:47.736
A lot of the ones in history, they used the library.

06:48.897 --> 06:53.522
And they came over and wanted us to find and help their students use them.

06:54.211 --> 06:58.596
Dr. Lange encouraged me to index a journal that was useful.

06:58.956 --> 07:06.604
And I've had people all over, and that was something that I wouldn't have ever done without his push on taking the classes, just getting to know him.

07:07.565 --> 07:14.632
And in the library, like I said, a hard taskmaster that I worked with in the library was Kathy Jackson.

07:15.533 --> 07:20.318
But she stood up for her people in reference.

07:20.338 --> 07:21.520
And so I learned from her.

07:22.501 --> 07:23.762
And I know a lot of people,

07:24.603 --> 07:27.025
Probably didn't or don't.

07:28.687 --> 07:34.973
I think we've got some people here at the library that I wouldn't want as a director.

07:35.013 --> 07:37.756
I can feel comfortable working with most people.

07:39.578 --> 07:39.918
All right.

07:39.938 --> 07:41.600
Then my last question is this one.

07:42.661 --> 07:46.905
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M and its library today?

07:48.186 --> 07:51.509
Well, like I said, I always wanted to work at A&M.

07:52.951 --> 07:54.272
And I haven't changed my field.

07:54.978 --> 07:59.405
Salary-wise, our library salaries are not that great.

08:00.226 --> 08:09.600
And the librarians and the people in the library on this campus have gone from being, we're still not first-class citizens.

08:11.783 --> 08:17.391
We were treated a lot of times, if you go in hierarchy below the custodial,

08:18.569 --> 08:24.300
We're still maybe a little above because a lot of people don't see the need for a library.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.064
They don't think that we're professionals.

08:28.068 --> 08:30.352
We do research, not the same type.

08:31.254 --> 08:40.172
I think in a way librarians are more professional than anyone else because my theory is

08:40.557 --> 08:45.224
You may be a jack of all trades, but a master of none.

08:45.925 --> 08:49.771
But someone in chemistry comes up and says, I need this.

08:51.013 --> 08:53.137
You can help them find the answer.

08:53.858 --> 08:57.043
Someone in history says, I want to find this.

08:57.383 --> 09:03.713
Like we had a telephone question, what did the loyalists do during the revolution yesterday?

09:04.334 --> 09:05.737
Did they burn their houses?

09:06.118 --> 09:08.442
So we had to go and find that answer.

09:09.184 --> 09:10.847
And this was a former history professor.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.911
I don't know who he was, but he came back.

09:13.332 --> 09:18.703
And we've had other people come in and say, I'm doing research on the battered children.

09:19.625 --> 09:20.807
What do you think about?

09:21.057 --> 09:24.881
We may not know the answer, but we know where to go and find the answer.

09:24.921 --> 09:32.207
And that's what we have to do is be able to find it or get you into the place to find the answer or show you how to use the material.

09:32.287 --> 09:38.173
So we have to know a lot of things where you may only need to know one, your narrow field.

09:38.233 --> 09:39.874
We have to know everything.

09:40.955 --> 09:46.120
And so that's what I think a librarian is supposed to do.

09:46.140 --> 09:49.123
I may not know a lot about everything, but I know a little bit about

09:51.213 --> 09:54.718
something about everything or how to find it or who to go to.

09:56.820 --> 10:01.026
And you feel warmly about the library and A&M at this time?

10:02.127 --> 10:03.890
If I didn't, I probably still wouldn't be here.

10:06.092 --> 10:06.333
That's okay.

10:06.353 --> 10:09.377
But I'm still here, and I don't know.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.499
I've been here since August of 64.

10:12.100 --> 10:21.152
I don't know how much longer the Lord's going to let me stay here, but I have a 13-year-old in the seventh grade.

10:21.132 --> 10:33.193
I have now an 11-month-old, so I'm going to be here a while and hope I can keep making the adaptions that's needed and be useful to the university.

10:34.355 --> 10:41.267
And I still have people come to me, even though there are others that are more technology-oriented than I am.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.102
I can still find the materials.

10:44.222 --> 10:49.288
I may be more book-oriented, but I can find the materials, and I probably always will be.

10:49.789 --> 10:58.139
And I have them come up, and I've had people say, oh, when the computers are down, electronics is down, how can we help people find?

10:58.179 --> 11:07.110
And I've been here long enough, and I've looked at the collection enough that I can say, well, you can go and browse in this area and find an answer.

11:07.170 --> 11:11.575
And I think that's a strength that those of us of the,

11:11.926 --> 11:19.121
older generation have that the younger generation doesn't have that's only used computers to find information.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.165
We can get you into an area.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.552
So I'll be here hopefully a long, long time.

11:25.334 --> 11:25.735
Thank you.

11:25.755 --> 11:26.256
Thank you.
