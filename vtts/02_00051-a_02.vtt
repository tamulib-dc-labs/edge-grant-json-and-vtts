00:02.528 --> 00:06.634
I thought that it was kind of funny one time when we had bread pudding.

00:06.954 --> 00:14.625
They sent us around to collect all of the big platters or bowls of bread pudding we could and then had a contest to see which freshman could eat the most.

00:15.246 --> 00:21.535
I don't think I ever ate bread pudding again after it cured me once and for all.

00:23.277 --> 00:27.143
As you recall those meals, did you have plenty to eat?

00:27.523 --> 00:27.944
Oh, yes.

00:28.104 --> 00:30.227
And the food was good.

00:30.267 --> 00:32.130
The only time I, you know,

00:32.110 --> 00:57.139
didn't like it or as a sophomore avoided the mess hall was when they served liver or something that I never really cared for and usually they'd tell us about that when the whistle jock would do his call and announce what was being served at the meal and we'd march up to the dining hall and as we hit the bottom steps I'd turn around go somewhere else go find a hamburger at Northgate or something did liver have a nickname

00:57.338 --> 00:58.359
I'm sure it did.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.261
Surely it did.

00:59.321 --> 01:01.003
I've never heard one before.

01:01.163 --> 01:01.724
I don't know.

01:01.744 --> 01:02.405
I imagine.

01:03.206 --> 01:05.349
What was the favorite dessert of desserts?

01:06.030 --> 01:06.490
Was there one?

01:08.513 --> 01:09.174
Little Valley.

01:10.676 --> 01:15.182
Ice cream was real popular when we had it, which was not real often.

01:15.202 --> 01:18.246
All right, let's see.

01:18.266 --> 01:18.967
Your outfit.

01:19.027 --> 01:21.490
What was its number and nickname?

01:21.858 --> 01:26.303
Well, A2 was an old field artillery outfit.

01:27.144 --> 01:35.253
And so, as far as nickname goes, we were, didn't call us.

01:38.676 --> 01:46.785
I don't know, we sang the field artillery song as we marched off the field at drill and

01:47.305 --> 01:48.306
different things like that.

01:48.346 --> 01:55.937
The band, knowing that we were a field artillery outfit, would often accommodate us by starting to play it after we passed the reviewing stand.

01:55.997 --> 02:00.243
So we kind of felt like we had an edge on a lot of other outfits that didn't get that privilege.

02:01.144 --> 02:09.415
Of course, when we were competing strongly with the band for the marching chord one year, just before we got to the reviewing stand,

02:09.800 --> 02:13.225
broke out into the most joyous circus march you've ever seen.

02:13.305 --> 02:19.294
And we bounced by the reviewing stand and dropped about 10 places in the marching place.

02:19.314 --> 02:27.186
And of course, about a week later, the band came back to their dorm and found the water flowing out the doors.

02:27.947 --> 02:34.977
They had gotten into it through the steam tunnels and taken off all the shower heads and everything, then turned the water back on.

02:35.017 --> 02:37.461
They say that the floors over in dorm

02:37.998 --> 02:43.247
11 are still bowed from the weight of the water that rested on them.

02:43.267 --> 02:48.595
But nobody knew how that accidental leak of water had gotten started.

02:48.615 --> 02:54.144
Well, I think they knew exactly where it came from, but there wasn't anything they could do about it.

02:55.406 --> 02:58.471
Did you make some special friendships that first year?

02:59.533 --> 03:01.356
Well, of course, there...

03:03.395 --> 03:17.251
I had some people that I was very close to, but they were mostly hometown buddies of mine that, like Lenny Cruz over in the Air Force unit, he and I talked each other into staying here.

03:17.351 --> 03:20.415
If we'd have ever both wanted to leave at the same time, we'd have probably quit.

03:20.495 --> 03:25.521
But fortunately, it always worked out that one of us was willing to talk the other one into staying.

03:26.210 --> 03:31.378
And Lenny has been mayor of League City now and is an attorney down in Galveston.

03:32.499 --> 03:36.826
He ended up very successful after he finally quit trying to be an architect.

03:37.607 --> 03:47.701
When did you first begin to privately worry about, should I stay here, should I drop out, should I go somewhere else?

03:48.382 --> 03:50.666
Did you have any of those feelings that first semester?

03:50.706 --> 03:53.550
Oh, I had a lot of those feelings that first semester.

03:53.530 --> 04:15.775
I'm not sure about any specific instances except that it usually I think followed some periods in which certain sophomores seemed to take a hideous delight in finding things to make life miserable for me and wanting to keep me up all night even if I had certain classes I had to deal with the next day.

04:16.497 --> 04:18.920
polishing people's floors and things like that.

04:20.202 --> 04:29.455
Matter of fact, one of the guys that comes and visits me every once in a while, I've got a couple of kids in school now, was one of the sophomores that did a lot of that back then.

04:29.755 --> 04:36.305
And I don't think he really knew what he was doing except exerting his authority.

04:36.325 --> 04:41.712
I think he didn't have much appreciation for the fact that

04:41.928 --> 04:49.095
And I think a lot of guys sort of figured that if they could run somebody off, that that was their job.

04:50.797 --> 04:51.378
I really do.

04:51.398 --> 04:57.924
I think that their attitude was, if we can make them go, they shouldn't be here in the first place.

04:58.825 --> 05:02.209
What were some of the assignments that you were given?

05:04.091 --> 05:05.672
Samples of those, please.

05:06.854 --> 05:11.158
We were mostly given what were called fart-off assignments, where

05:11.459 --> 05:25.895
One upperclassman would tell you to go do something to another upperclassman and either verbally or maybe something not exactly confrontational but more physical in nature.

05:26.515 --> 05:35.425
And we would usually have two upperclassmen oftentimes would tell us to do something and we quickly learned that

05:35.911 --> 05:42.217
We tried to do what the one we got along with the best would let us do because we knew the other one was going to give us hell no matter what we did.

05:42.998 --> 05:47.242
So we didn't want to make the one we got along with a little better mad at us.

05:50.765 --> 05:53.527
We had some interesting times that freshman year.

05:54.108 --> 05:57.571
The football players thought it was real funny one night.

05:57.611 --> 06:02.796
They loaded up their trash cans with water and came over from Henderson Hall right across the field there.

06:03.704 --> 06:06.808
and threw water in the bottom floor windows of our dorm.

06:07.389 --> 06:12.756
One guy had an architecture project that was totally ruined that he'd been working months on.

06:13.817 --> 06:20.346
And we sat around trying to figure out what were we gonna do to get back at these people.

06:20.666 --> 06:27.535
And the next day as we went to class, the swimming pool at Henderson Hall had turned a bright red color.

06:28.536 --> 06:33.643
And apparently when they drained the pool, all of the red adhered to the walls of the pool.

06:34.028 --> 06:46.287
and so for a week or two after that we kind of enjoyed going by there on our way to class and watching the football players out there scrubbing the sides of that swimming pool trying to get the red ink off or paint or whatever it was.

06:48.169 --> 06:49.652
Had some hellacious water fights.

06:51.394 --> 07:01.690
It was usually a warm night in the spring and somebody was bored and wanted something to do so they got out in the middle of the quad and started yelling water fight and the next thing you know we had

07:02.851 --> 07:13.347
military operations with one unit lined up over here and one unit lined up over here and at a given command they would charge each other and throw their buckets of water and try to just drown everybody out.

07:14.628 --> 07:23.241
We didn't have any of this quadding, they call it now, where they spread eagle and throw water out about a third floor window onto people.

07:23.301 --> 07:24.803
We didn't do any of that back then.

07:25.505 --> 07:29.230
Although I did understand that one guy in a nearby dorm

07:29.530 --> 07:36.017
playing a game of hall hockey, went out of an up floor window and somehow survived it and walked away from it.

07:36.037 --> 07:38.720
But accidentally he went out the window?

07:38.760 --> 07:43.946
Oh yeah, they were racing to try to score a goal at the end of the hall and he didn't stop when he got to the window at the end of the hall.

07:45.587 --> 07:48.370
Did y'all have drown outs?

07:48.771 --> 07:49.652
Oh yeah.

07:50.112 --> 07:58.221
We had, I don't know what language you want on this tape, but we had these sticks made out of end of coke cases that would

07:58.960 --> 08:19.382
be used to lock the doors from the outside when you did something and we would have a guy there with a stick and then somebody would go in with a bucket or with a firecracker or something like that and throw it at whoever was in the bed and then we'd slam the doors closed and throw the stick on it and they couldn't get out.

08:19.362 --> 08:21.366
You'd usually hear them yelling in there.

08:22.508 --> 08:34.729
And they pulled a trick one time where they took an inner tube from a bicycle and they tied one end of it to the inside door handle.

08:34.749 --> 08:37.133
The room doors all opened in to the room.

08:38.315 --> 08:44.526
And then they tied a piece of rope to the other end of the inner tube and then they stretched it and tied it to the

08:45.012 --> 09:06.223
and then about four of them would get a hold of the door and pull the door closed and of course the tension on it would hold it kind of stiff and when a guy came to open his door it wouldn't turn good and he'd have to grab that handle and turn it and the next thing you know he was launched into his room.

09:07.345 --> 09:12.673
They left a footlocker out in the middle of the room one time for a guy and he nearly killed himself.

09:13.025 --> 09:15.670
He stopped about this far short of going out the window.

09:17.554 --> 09:24.888
But people set off fireworks outside of the windows in the middle of study period at night during the call to quarters.

09:24.908 --> 09:35.809
And we think it was an M-80 practice grenade that somebody lowered on a string and set off ones that literally shattered a guy's window.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.135
And it could have been very damaging.

09:38.175 --> 09:42.324
Luckily, he was not sitting where it would hit him when it came in.

09:42.464 --> 09:47.113
But he did walk around with his ears ringing for quite a long time after that.

09:48.436 --> 09:54.388
But babo bombs, another innovation of that was the cocoa bomb.

09:54.942 --> 09:57.706
which provided this nice little brown powder.

09:57.786 --> 10:06.880
You packed it down in a little Dixie cup or something, put a T-bomb or a cherry bomb in the middle of it, and then taped over the top of it with just the fuse sticking out.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.544
You'd light that and toss it into somebody's room.

10:10.485 --> 10:15.853
And my brother was in his bed one time over in dorm 17,

10:16.778 --> 10:25.185
He heard somebody at the door and about that time he saw the trail of sparks from the fuse as they tossed this into his room.

10:25.520 --> 10:30.026
And he said he knew he didn't have time to get out the door, so he just grabbed the sheets and pulled them over his head.

10:31.348 --> 10:36.075
After that thing went off, he peeked out and there was this cloud of dust coming down.

10:36.495 --> 10:37.817
And he said that stuff got in.

10:38.818 --> 10:48.071
Inside of every shirt or pair of clothing in the drawers in the dresser, got inside of the clothes hanging in the closet, the powder just went everywhere.

10:49.052 --> 10:51.696
Now, normally, did the person...

10:53.228 --> 10:57.552
get bombed after doing something to some other people?

10:57.833 --> 11:04.440
Well, usually it was a sophomore or even a junior occasionally who raised hell with somebody below him.

11:04.460 --> 11:05.641
And he was getting paid back.

11:05.661 --> 11:06.702
That's right.

11:06.722 --> 11:08.444
It was comeuppance.

11:08.964 --> 11:11.847
Then what was their retaliation normally then?

11:12.468 --> 11:17.233
Well, of course, they usually put the entire freshman class or whoever they thought did it through hell.

11:17.633 --> 11:22.138
One time when a junior got something happened to him,

11:22.456 --> 11:28.622
He jumped all over the sophomores because he figured the freshmen weren't going to mess with him because he never did anything to the freshmen.

11:29.243 --> 11:33.627
And we had a little fun that week watching the sophomores go through hell.

11:38.032 --> 11:38.432
Let's see.

11:40.654 --> 11:41.235
Sophomore.

11:41.475 --> 11:44.298
What was it like to be a sophomore?

11:44.318 --> 11:50.404
Well, it felt like you'd just kind of died and gone to heaven for a while until you suddenly realized there were two classes still above you.

11:51.059 --> 12:02.640
And that not only did they have the authority to give you hell if they wanted to, but they were also kind of like the policeman guarding and watching what you were doing with the freshman.

12:03.241 --> 12:12.898
So you had to kind of watch your step a little more carefully, but at least as long as you kept it within reasonable bounds, you were pretty well allowed to

12:13.351 --> 12:15.273
deal with the freshman any way you wanted to.

12:15.673 --> 12:23.900
Now did that transition of ceasing to be a fish, did that occur at final review?

12:23.940 --> 12:37.292
It was supposed to occur at final review and the idea was that at final review everybody moved up a class so you were no longer a freshman.

12:38.713 --> 12:42.396
I do remember that, let's see,

12:45.734 --> 12:48.378
I can't remember if it was just before final review.

12:48.398 --> 12:54.365
I think before final review, they had some sessions with us in which they kind of told us how it was going to be.

12:55.127 --> 12:59.172
And some of them started getting pretty casual about things then.

13:00.093 --> 13:03.918
And then after final review, it was all a done deal.

13:04.018 --> 13:07.062
And everybody went around shaking hands.

13:07.143 --> 13:10.527
And those that hadn't dropped handles with you, and you

13:10.912 --> 13:14.157
changed into your new uniform pieces for the second time around.

13:14.197 --> 13:16.680
So it was different.

13:16.700 --> 13:24.171
My sophomore year, I got in a little bit of trouble because we had a short junior who was fixing to become a senior.

13:25.493 --> 13:34.506
And I made the mistake of commenting offhandedly that he would be able to keep his senior boots under his bed.

13:37.118 --> 13:42.406
And so I got to actually leave after final review.

13:42.446 --> 13:50.057
I had to go home in class A uniform when everybody else was in civilian clubs.

13:51.620 --> 14:05.320
During all those years, whether it was your first or your last year, there must have been some people that now you look back upon as memorable as teachers, advisors, role models who were

14:05.958 --> 14:19.652
Well, the one I remember the most was Dan Lowe over in business because I'd transferred to accounting and was in that area when I ended up laying out of school in 62.

14:19.913 --> 14:29.443
And I was called before an appeals board when I was notified that I was going to be dropped from the rolls for a period of time.

14:30.484 --> 14:34.648
And the main thing that stuck in my mind was Dan Lowe telling me

14:35.236 --> 14:40.903
to make up my mind right then, that minute, that I was gonna come back and finish my degree.

14:41.944 --> 14:48.291
Because he said that if you didn't do it now, you'd keep putting it off and putting it off until eventually you never would do it.

14:49.052 --> 14:56.962
And that was the best advice I ever got, because I did have it in my mind to come back from that moment.

14:57.142 --> 15:01.547
As far as teachers, of course I had Jim Earl for graphics,

15:02.675 --> 15:10.604
Jim was a lot different sort of person teaching than he was out in just social life.

15:10.745 --> 15:11.385
Describe that.

15:12.447 --> 15:30.268
Well, he was very, he was an easy going teacher but he was very rigid that you needed to know how to do this and you needed to get your drawings right and things and he didn't have a whole lot of patience with people who didn't take the time and spend the effort to learn how to do it right.

15:30.923 --> 15:38.795
And I think I got a mediocre grade in that class, but that was one of the things I was able to leave behind me when I left engineering.

15:39.336 --> 15:43.502
Were you all aware then, the students, that he did Cadet Slouch?

15:43.642 --> 15:44.003
Oh, yes.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.226
We knew who he was.

15:46.367 --> 15:50.894
And I've had a very pleasant relationship with him since then.

15:50.954 --> 15:51.835
Matter of fact, we have

15:52.507 --> 15:56.652
I talked him into doing a cartoon time or two for us on the magazine.

15:57.032 --> 16:00.176
He helped do a promotion for our building fund campaign here.

16:00.897 --> 16:09.727
And he did a cartoon for me once about some old timers commenting.

16:09.827 --> 16:17.856
We sent him a cut line and he did it about some old timers sitting around wondering if heaven was going to be like A&M.

16:18.848 --> 16:24.274
Were you students aware of who the model was for Cadet Slouch?

16:25.134 --> 16:25.695
The model?

16:26.155 --> 16:26.376
No.

16:26.496 --> 16:27.337
Who was the person?

16:27.777 --> 16:28.998
I don't think I ever knew that.

16:29.499 --> 16:31.261
He told me it was Jim Earl.

16:31.581 --> 16:33.683
Jim Earl was his own model?

16:33.703 --> 16:35.365
I wasn't surprised.

16:35.385 --> 16:38.228
Who did he use for Cadet Squirt?

16:38.428 --> 16:38.928
I don't know.

16:39.029 --> 16:39.549
I wondered.

16:39.869 --> 16:47.337
My favorite one of his cartoons was that one of Cadet Squirt in that raincoat with that helmet liner.

16:47.620 --> 16:57.856
down over his head where he couldn't really see anything but the raincoat and the helmet liner, and he's carrying this sign that says, wait till next year.

16:59.799 --> 17:01.321
Of course, we did that a lot back then.

17:01.401 --> 17:03.945
We didn't win a lot of football games in those days.

17:04.506 --> 17:09.854
Who were some other advisors, teachers that now you look back upon with some gratitude?

17:10.375 --> 17:11.316
They made a difference.

17:11.954 --> 17:12.735
Oh, golly.

17:13.876 --> 17:30.854
Well, I had Carl Elmquist for English, and interestingly enough, he became one of my predecessors in the Texas Aggie Magazine because he edited it on a part-time basis for a couple of years back then, and I think that was after I left and before Joe Buser came in.

17:32.035 --> 17:37.000
I remember taking his literature class and

17:37.199 --> 17:43.328
And quite frankly, I very rarely could interpret the literature the way he said it was supposed to be interpreted.

17:43.409 --> 17:52.517
I've learned a lot since then and I'm really appreciative of poetry and prose now that I didn't have at that time.

17:53.578 --> 17:55.119
When did you become a journalism major?

17:55.900 --> 18:06.149
When I came back to school, my brother had been a journalism major and I had taken that photography course in journalism while I was still in the core.

18:07.150 --> 18:12.775
And after that, I don't know, I just,

18:12.755 --> 18:21.906
I kind of liked what he said he was doing and what was going on so I thought I'd try journalism and it stuck and it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

18:22.046 --> 18:24.655
What about some journalism faculty that were important to you?

18:25.327 --> 18:27.970
Well, of course, Wes Calvert was over there then.

18:28.070 --> 18:38.642
He's the guy I took photography from, and I think he was very knowledgeable, and I think he gave us a broad range of experience.

18:38.722 --> 18:54.861
I mean, the exercises that we went through, and don't get me wrong, I don't want to criticize what they're doing over there now, but it was much more, to me, journalistic photography that we were being taught instead of photography for photography's sake.

18:55.313 --> 19:12.835
They end up with a lot of lighting exercises and special setup exercises and stuff where he taught us how to try to go get the picture and how to look for an angle that would be different to show and illustrate what's going on in a particular event.

19:13.716 --> 19:15.878
And I guess he taught me well.

19:15.979 --> 19:19.583
I got dirt thrown in my face by the mayor of Galveston at a

19:19.867 --> 19:29.022
groundbreaking ceremony once because I laid down on my back and shot the picture past the shovels of him and the dignitaries digging dirt and he tossed dirt right at me.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.307
But it was fun over there.

19:34.591 --> 19:40.761
Mr. Knight was one of the journalism professors.

19:41.264 --> 19:52.886
pretty rigid and not a whole lot of fun I remember and he did concentrate a lot on the basics of learning you know how to put a story together and how to get it in the right order and that.

19:53.969 --> 19:57.596
Probably the most fun prof we had over there was Dave Bowers.

19:57.616 --> 20:00.381
Dave was kind of a freshman himself.

20:01.042 --> 20:04.048
He came in here after having worked for newspapers and

20:04.366 --> 20:12.597
To show you how easy-going a guy Dave was, I sold subscriptions to Playboy magazine back then, and Dave bought a subscription from me.

20:13.317 --> 20:20.367
But Dave taught us magazine writing when he had never worked on a magazine.

20:20.827 --> 20:24.292
He taught us public relations when he'd never worked in public relations.

20:24.912 --> 20:28.517
He did it largely by bringing in speakers, which I think helped us

20:28.987 --> 20:54.629
a great deal, we had the fellow, what's his last name, Kershaw or something like that, that was with the Houston Sports Association and talked to us about how that was set up and how they handled the public relations for the program and how they helped get the team started and handled the stadium.

20:56.271 --> 20:58.673
Mike Mistovich, who ran the local radio station,

20:59.345 --> 21:01.027
was also one of those speakers.

21:01.127 --> 21:10.620
And after class, Bob Bell, who's a local businessman here now, still in radio, talked to him about doing a radio show.

21:11.521 --> 21:16.988
At that time, we did it, I think, once a week, and then it later became twice a week, called the Aggie Hour.

21:17.729 --> 21:20.052
And Mike was very generous.

21:20.092 --> 21:23.597
He let us sell advertising and let us keep 50% of the profits.

21:23.881 --> 21:26.384
which did a whole lot to help me pay for school.

21:27.465 --> 21:29.688
And that was on what station?

21:29.928 --> 21:31.249
That was on KORA.

21:32.351 --> 21:34.914
And what time of the week was it?

21:35.614 --> 21:37.917
We ended up doing them on Tuesday and Thursday nights.

21:38.197 --> 21:43.944
And it was usually, seemed to me it was a fairly late show.

21:43.984 --> 21:47.088
It was like about 10 o'clock or something like that that we'd do it.

21:47.969 --> 21:52.774
And mostly played records, talked about things that were going on on campus and all.

21:53.378 --> 21:54.760
Had a few memorable events.

21:54.840 --> 22:04.434
The next year after that, that I started with Bob, he graduated, and so I picked up Tom Morgan, who was a year or so behind me, to be my partner.

22:04.494 --> 22:11.784
And Tom didn't want to sell any advertising, so I got to make all the advertising revenue and then paid him a little bit to be on the air with me.

22:12.886 --> 22:21.698
And, of course, the Vietnam was starting to get pretty big back then, and one of Tom's more memorable faux pas was

22:22.066 --> 22:31.076
when he didn't realize the mic was open, he was joking around about something and he yelled out, but I don't want to die in a rice paddy.

22:31.357 --> 22:42.329
And we heard about that for weeks from people, questioning his patriotism, questioning us even expressing such an opinion on the air and things like that.

22:46.434 --> 22:50.318
People bring us pizzas and even a cake once

22:50.635 --> 22:52.638
feed us while we were on the air out there.

22:52.678 --> 22:54.681
We had a lot of fun.

22:54.881 --> 23:02.212
What were the, at that time, what were the local electronic media outlets in Bryan College Station?

23:03.935 --> 23:07.680
Well, I don't know when Channel 3 got going.

23:07.700 --> 23:11.766
I'm sure it was going, I know it was when I came back to school in 62 because

23:13.282 --> 23:17.031
People broke down the furniture over in the student lounges watching Batman.

23:17.772 --> 23:22.583
And so I know TV was around, but of course we didn't have a whole lot of time to watch it.

23:23.305 --> 23:25.289
Radio was about the only thing we ever tuned.

23:25.309 --> 23:26.953
And how many radio stations were there?

23:27.457 --> 23:48.368
Well, it was WTAW, which has been here forever, and then KORA, and I think it was about that time that Mike put in his FM operation, and I think maybe WTAW followed closely behind him on that, and mostly he was running simulcast or else tape music all the time.

23:48.348 --> 24:00.646
I worked for Mike one summer and did the control board and handled the basic news reading and reading ads and stuff like that.

24:01.547 --> 24:08.878
Got a call from him one day, wanted to know why I had been putting dead air out for the last 15 minutes and I'd thrown the wrong switch.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.545
He wasn't too happy about that, but he understood.

24:14.032 --> 24:21.882
Let's see, in journalism in those days, was the battalion an outlet for student journalists in those days?

24:22.883 --> 24:37.862
Well, it was, and they didn't use, they tried to use student writers some, but the battalion had a nucleus of about eight editors over there, and

24:38.585 --> 24:42.529
they pretty much decided whose stuff they were gonna use and who they weren't.

24:42.589 --> 24:50.958
They weren't in quite a rigid mode of using student input unless it was something they talked to them about and assigned them.

24:51.359 --> 24:54.422
So it had no particular link with the journalism?

24:54.782 --> 24:56.284
Not really connected, no.

24:57.205 --> 25:06.955
And they gave them a set budget for their staff and I worked for the battalion for about a semester

25:07.694 --> 25:19.995
And then that's when I quit and started the radio show because we found out that the editors at the top were dividing most of the money among themselves and then giving a pittance out to everybody else.

25:20.035 --> 25:27.287
I think I made $4 one month on their distribution of funds and I didn't feel like that was very fair.

25:31.815 --> 25:33.297
Let's see, oh, classrooms.

25:34.407 --> 25:45.750
What was the norm then for student classroom behavior, rate of attendance, what you wear, and so forth?

25:45.770 --> 25:48.315
What was normal then for a student going to class?

25:48.532 --> 25:55.779
Well, of course, when I was in the Corps, my clothing was pretty well dictated by whatever the uniform of the day was.

25:57.381 --> 26:02.145
We did have a lot of civilian students in class, and they pretty much wore whatever they wanted to to class.

26:02.626 --> 26:08.792
What were the, whatever they wanted to, how wide was the variation then in student dress?

26:10.133 --> 26:17.340
Well, I mean, people wore shorts to class and tennis shoes and things like that.

26:17.928 --> 26:20.532
But there wasn't any long hair, there weren't any tattoos.

26:20.993 --> 26:22.355
Not to speak of.

26:22.375 --> 26:24.198
There may have been some, but they were rare.

26:24.980 --> 26:27.704
How often did you and your buddies go to class?

26:28.826 --> 26:29.868
How often?

26:30.569 --> 26:33.734
Did almost everybody attend class?

26:33.754 --> 26:34.856
Oh, yeah.

26:34.876 --> 26:35.577
Well, it depended.

26:35.637 --> 26:43.851
We had some profs that took roll, and so you definitely had to be there for that or you'd get counted off for not being there.

26:45.316 --> 26:49.261
Most of the profs pretty much emphasized attendance in class.

26:49.542 --> 26:54.068
They weren't like some profs today that pretty well, you know, it's here if you want it.

26:54.128 --> 26:56.711
If it's not, well, that's too bad, you know.

26:56.731 --> 26:58.634
And going to sleep in class?

26:59.715 --> 27:04.742
Usually they'd throw something at you or find some way to make you jump and embarrass you a little bit.

27:05.228 --> 27:12.544
or they'd holler real loud and catch your attention and try to ask you a question which you obviously didn't know the answer to.

27:13.606 --> 27:18.437
What role did the MSC play in the early 60s in the life of this campus?

27:18.858 --> 27:20.301
What happened at the MSC?

27:20.450 --> 27:27.964
Well, the MSC was the only place people could go and relax in off-duty hours in the evening and stuff.

27:30.870 --> 27:33.414
Most upperclassmen could wear any clothes.

27:33.434 --> 27:36.400
They could wear non-rig clothes and go over there.

27:36.802 --> 27:44.537
Freshmen were supposed to be in uniform anytime they went anywhere on campus, except around their dorm.

27:45.299 --> 27:51.271
And the only time they could wear civilian clothes was during late hours or weekends when they went off campus.

27:51.832 --> 27:56.802
And you had to be going off campus or somebody would stop you and want to know what you're doing in civilian clothes.

27:59.330 --> 28:03.974
The MSC was real popular with people.

28:04.034 --> 28:08.218
I think it gave them a place to kind of go get away from the people in their outfit.

28:08.478 --> 28:14.644
The most popular gathering spot was the snack bar or coffee room area.

28:15.324 --> 28:28.476
And we used to call it the MSC within the MSC because there was a coat rack on the outside of the coffee area that you would hang your

28:29.198 --> 28:32.162
your fatigue jacket and put your hat on and stuff.

28:32.983 --> 28:36.988
And quite often people came back to that rack to find their coat wasn't there.

28:38.089 --> 28:41.413
So that's where it got its nickname, the Military Swapping Center.

28:42.435 --> 28:50.565
And if someone lost a piece of clothing, I think oftentimes they would replace it with someone else's they picked up off of that rack.

28:51.018 --> 28:58.245
Otherwise, you'd end up having to pay to replace something that was issued to you or go buy a piece of clothing.

28:58.265 --> 29:10.497
Did the norms of class hazing, sophomore picking on a freshman, did that normally not occur in the MSC?

29:10.737 --> 29:14.621
MSC was pretty much off limits for any of that stuff, yeah.

29:14.941 --> 29:20.687
And I forgot to mention on the coffee, it was only five cents a cup and you got all the refills you wanted.

29:21.005 --> 29:50.944
people I remember a fellow named Teague that was a journalism major used to corner get a corner table and commandeer it and I don't know whether he was skipping class or not but I know he was there when I when I left for class and he was there when I came back again but no the MSC was was sort of a haven and you didn't have to worry about anybody you know giving you a bad time there they might chew you out for something that you should have done

29:51.228 --> 29:55.474
they wanted to question you on, but as far as hazing you or anything, no, they didn't do that.

29:55.494 --> 30:00.982
How soon were you and your buddies aware of all of the activities that the MSC sponsored?

30:02.184 --> 30:09.675
Well, I don't know that I got fully aware of it until I came back and was a civilian student.

30:10.094 --> 30:15.124
got involved covering things like SCONA and some other activities that were happening over there.

30:16.085 --> 30:29.310
I didn't take advantage of it as much as I should, and I've tried to encourage my daughter and my nieces and nephews to get involved in things, because I think that's where the real education is.

30:29.431 --> 30:32.777
I mean, the book learning end of it's fine,

30:32.757 --> 30:40.594
The things you learn in activities like that are the ones that really stay with you and give you an extra leg up on a lot of people.

30:41.135 --> 30:45.705
Did you get acquainted in those years with J. Wayne Stark?

30:45.725 --> 30:49.112
Oh yes, I knew Mr. Stark and we used to

30:49.632 --> 30:52.558
go interview him for different stories from time to time.

30:52.618 --> 30:58.389
And he was a good source of information about just about anything.

30:58.630 --> 31:11.134
And I know we quickly learned that a lot of students used him as a conduit to get contact with the people in the law profession, the people on Wall Street.
