WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:07.992
Should there be one central agency to direct 
oceanography in this country?

00:13.259 --> 00:13.960
No, I don't think so. I think it

00:14.001 --> 00:20.470
always seems very tidy to have it that way. And it is 
something that the congressmen always seem to

00:21.051 --> 00:28.982
want, something they can understand. It's a 
wiring program. They'd like a simple wiring

00:31.756 --> 00:36.862
program where they can see everything nice and 
neat and tidy. But I think the strength of the

00:38.243 --> 00:44.811
American system is, well, it's based on its 
performance. I mean, we're way, way ahead of the

00:44.891 --> 00:51.318
Russians, for example, in oceanography, way 
ahead of the rest of the world. And we do more

00:52.599 --> 00:59.367
oceanography in all of Western Europe together.

00:59.566 --> 01:06.515
The Russians, the congressmen and some people are 
wanting to claim the Russians are ahead of us. And

01:07.537 --> 01:11.021
this is mainly a gambit, I guess, to get more 
funding. And they quote ship tonnages and things

01:12.604 --> 01:14.947
like that. But the Russian works are simply, 
although it's very tidy, I'm trying to point out

01:15.047 --> 01:22.637
that they have a very, very You can understand 
their wiring diagram very well. You can see Venero

01:25.427 --> 01:27.851
and the various agencies. It's very nicely 
organized. But it just doesn't run. Because the

01:32.399 --> 01:48.186
strength of our system is that

01:32.399 --> 01:48.186
it is so loose and so loosely structured We have 
industrial groups. We have university groups. We

01:52.661 --> 01:54.423
have governmental groups. And

01:55.705 --> 02:03.213
we know our communications are sufficiently good 
that we don't duplicate work. I mean, we know what

02:03.233 --> 02:04.915
other people are doing. The literature is very 
good. We're in contact. So we don't want to do

02:07.679 --> 02:10.081
something someone else is doing. So the problem 
with duplication, that seems to

02:19.773 --> 02:22.936
bother congressmen and so forth, it really 
doesn't exist. We're much better off having a very

02:23.937 --> 02:30.884
loosely structured

02:23.937 --> 02:30.884
system, such as we have. Once

02:30.944 --> 02:47.299
you have a very formalized large group and you're 
just a small pond somewhere down, You get paid just

02:47.836 --> 02:50.861
as much for marching as you do for fighting. And you 
have all these people above you and you try to write

02:52.163 --> 03:00.415
a paper and all these people are correcting your 
English and controlling what you do. It's

03:00.455 --> 03:11.532
very difficult for people to ever be creative or to 
get something out. The reason I've been

03:12.895 --> 03:26.089
productive over the years is in spite of the 
system, I've always felt that I was

03:12.895 --> 03:26.089
bypassing it or disobeying. The letter of the rule 
should say, just get something done, getting

03:26.169 --> 03:31.615
proper clearances for publishing papers. Try to 
get clearance, the thing will last for years. I

03:36.941 --> 03:42.767
mean, these things go through channels and they 
get lost somewhere.

03:43.912 --> 03:53.662
I wrote the first paper about economic

03:43.912 --> 03:53.662
use of manganese nodules and published it in the 
California Journal of Mines and Geology. Well,

03:54.963 --> 04:00.029
this had to be sent to Washington for clearance, 
and it was two years. I had to search for it and find

04:00.049 --> 04:02.391
it. Finally, it came back, and I finally, but I 
mean, it just was hopeless to get something,

04:02.491 --> 04:08.017
something. These idea procedures, clearance 
procedures, seemed to be very useful and they're

04:13.865 --> 04:39.602
reasonable but the steps are such that you're you 
get to the point where a great many people rather

04:13.865 --> 04:39.602
than trying to fight the system just do nothing 
they just drift along so

04:13.865 --> 04:39.602
even now in my present position where I am right now 
you see I retired as the first of the year and I'm

04:13.865 --> 04:39.602
here as a guest of NOAA as an emeritus scientist And 
this to me is a great feeling of freedom to me

04:40.612 --> 04:46.638
because now I can do just what I want to do. And I'm 
here as a guest but as a retiree without salary and

04:47.198 --> 04:56.907
I'm my own person and I can write something and I'm 
not beholden. I don't have this need to be

04:57.308 --> 05:08.138
concerned about being a government employee.

05:09.502 --> 05:11.985
I can do things in my own right. And this, of course, 
is a great pleasure being a university professor,

05:12.405 --> 05:17.672
which I am now. I'm a visiting professor at two 
universities this year. And so to me to go to

05:22.337 --> 05:37.195
university and be completely free and just not 
have to consult other people about what I'm doing

05:22.337 --> 05:37.195
and what I'm writing and where I'm publishing, 
this to me is really great. It's really wonderful

05:37.215 --> 05:39.458
to have this freedom to do this.

05:42.290 --> 05:52.660
Uh, describe your experiences in the USSR in, in 64 
and in 66, speaking of relationships with

05:42.290 --> 05:52.660
governments. Well, this, this to me was a very, uh,

05:52.680 --> 05:59.908
interesting experience. And I, I've written a 
couple of papers about it and you may have seen

06:00.008 --> 06:02.490
them. And, uh, many things are, are,

06:02.871 --> 06:12.060
you, you, you, I've always regarded myself as sort 
of a liberal and I've always been sort of I guess

06:12.327 --> 06:38.470
friendly to Russians and Russian ideas and

06:12.327 --> 06:38.470
I

06:12.327 --> 06:38.470
came away with great mixed feelings of course I 
went there also with mixed feelings but I and I

06:12.327 --> 06:38.470
still and not at all naive about the Russian system 
and the Soviets. But I think I can detect their

06:46.762 --> 06:53.028
philosophy and their flaws. I think, first of all,

06:53.068 --> 07:03.899
Churchill referred to Russia as being a paradox 
wrapped inside of an enigma. Nothing could be

07:05.981 --> 07:07.022
further wrong. the

07:09.348 --> 07:26.833
things in Russia are exactly what you would expect 
and everyone is goose-stepping they're all in

07:09.348 --> 07:26.833
everything is orderly and

07:09.348 --> 07:26.833
you can you can learn To me, living in the U.S. is 
like a game of chess. You can jump there, you can

07:32.223 --> 07:34.745
jump there, you can jump out of government. If you 
don't like your boss, you can do this, you can go

07:34.906 --> 07:38.109
elsewhere. If you have a job in Washington and 
you're not happy where you are, you just take a job

07:38.149 --> 07:44.415
elsewhere in the city and drive a different 
direction. And you can't do this in Russia. It's

07:47.378 --> 07:48.299
like a game of checkers. And everywhere you're 
blocked, you're in a very strict hierarchy.

07:53.684 --> 07:55.446
There's no service except the government 
service. It's only one way up. sort of a dead man's

07:58.184 --> 08:03.953
shoes development, and you have to wait for people 
to. So you have this, even if you're not controlled

08:03.973 --> 08:18.895
by your superiors and by their thoughts, you're in 
a system where any advancement involves these

08:03.973 --> 08:18.895
people. So even if it's not an overt control of your 
work, you're very highly controlled, and this is a

08:18.915 --> 08:26.807
very sterile sort of life. and it's the idea of the 
Soviet Union being advanced

08:28.525 --> 08:55.427
technologically or socially is rather 
ridiculous they're very Victorian in all their

08:28.525 --> 08:55.427
mores and their science too I mean their ideas are 
it's I just reviewed a paper here

08:56.825 --> 09:01.431
for Sea Frontiers of this book called The World 
Rift System or something like that. This book,

09:02.892 --> 09:07.438
they still don't believe in continental drift. I 
mean, it's rather, it's archaic. Of course, it's a

09:09.440 --> 09:19.252
book published a couple years ago, but even so, 
they're just so far behind the times in their

09:09.440 --> 09:19.252
notions and ideas that they just really aren't 
with the modern world.

09:25.900 --> 09:26.781
Well, the... You must give them credit for what 
they've done, of course. But you wonder how they do

09:33.107 --> 09:34.548
it. And I have the feeling that they do it more or 
less the way we did things in the Army. If you send

09:40.794 --> 09:44.638
two men to do a job and they can't do it, you send 
four. If four can't do it, you send eight. So it's a

09:47.241 --> 09:53.287
very massive sort of pondering approach to 
solutions of projects. But it's not a very... It's

09:58.216 --> 10:01.100
a very stifling system. Why specifically did you 
go to the Soviet Union in 64 and 66? Why did I go?

10:09.614 --> 10:25.438
Well,

10:09.614 --> 10:25.438
I guess the first time I went, I was

10:09.614 --> 10:25.438
invited to be on the delegation of At that time, we 
had set up these exchanges, of course, and I was

10:25.655 --> 10:38.717
invited to participate as a member of that 
delegation, as the marine geologist

10:25.655 --> 10:38.717
geophysicist. And so I was very anxious to see the 
Soviet Union, and I thought I could do a useful job.

10:45.648 --> 10:51.358
And so I accepted and was on this team.

10:52.098 --> 10:54.300
This is one of the advantages of being in 
Washington, DC. These nice things happen to you

10:54.380 --> 10:59.826
when you're in Washington, which never happened 
to you when you're out in the field. Things like

11:01.087 --> 11:02.629
this are organized in Washington. And if you're 
there, you're likely to be invited. But if you're

11:04.370 --> 11:12.418
somewhere else, like down in Miami, your chances 
of being invited to participate are minimal. And I

11:12.438 --> 11:20.907
returned in 66 to the Second International 
Oceanographic Congress.

11:21.781 --> 11:45.983
Of course, I was extremely interested in 
developments in the Soviet Union, just as a

11:21.781 --> 11:45.983
scientific and cultural problem to really

11:21.781 --> 11:45.983
see how a system which, you know, seems to be 
beautifully organized, they have all the very

11:21.781 --> 11:45.983
simple correct wiring diagrams and so forth, why 
it didn't work. I was interested in knowing why it

11:47.586 --> 11:49.168
didn't work. Because it would appear to be a model 
of efficiency, you know, but it's a... And you go

11:50.150 --> 12:06.910
there and you'll find out, soon realize that the 
flaws in the system, the fact that they're too

11:50.150 --> 12:06.910
tightly coupled. How did meteorites fit into your 
career? Well, I... As I explained in the

12:15.308 --> 12:18.852
beginning, an interest of mine was in astronomy. 
And I went to University of Illinois, even with the

12:19.612 --> 12:26.019
idea of possibly majoring in astronomy. But I was 
not inspired by the particular professor there,

12:27.640 --> 12:34.467
Professor Baker, the one man astronomy 
department. So I took some course in astronomy,

12:34.567 --> 12:38.151
but I didn't go beyond that. But I did retain this 
interest in

12:45.380 --> 12:52.566
in astronomy and in the moon as a geological 
object, because we could see the features on the

12:45.380 --> 12:52.566
moon. And I, in fact, when I submitted an idea for a 
PhD thesis, I submitted the idea that I should try

12:54.648 --> 13:07.280
to interpret the lunar surface. And this proposal 
of mine was declined by the University of

13:09.041 --> 13:15.387
Illinois. Well, I'd like to say because they told 
me, I guess rather facetiously, that there's no

13:17.324 --> 13:22.671
way of checking my field work. Actually, there was 
no professor there who was interested in sort of

13:23.472 --> 13:46.723
sponsoring this work that I could work under, and 
so I worked on these deep-sea clays instead, but I

13:23.472 --> 13:46.723
did have this interest, and when I was in the Air 
Force, I was involved in photo mapping, so I became

13:23.472 --> 13:46.723
very interested in this aspect of remote sensing, 
and of course we see more or less an aerial map of the

13:47.159 --> 13:51.626
moon.

13:54.891 --> 14:16.002
So I, and I was aware as a student in Illinois of the 
structure at Ketlin, which was then called a

13:54.891 --> 14:16.002
cryptovolcanic structure caused by some hidden 
volcanic explosion, and I

13:54.891 --> 14:16.002
visited during World War II on

14:17.500 --> 14:38.826
I had occasion to fly around in connection with 
training flights, and one time with transferring

14:17.500 --> 14:38.826
aircraft, I would stop close by and get out to this 
quarry and study it, and had these features we call

14:17.500 --> 14:38.826
shatter cones, which, and I reasoned that, well, 
this is one of those ideas that come to you ahead of

14:17.500 --> 14:38.826
time, and you go to the field to check it. I thought 
the orientation of the shatter cone should reveal

14:38.866 --> 14:47.136
what the force came from above or from below, once 
you turn the rocks to their pre-event position to a

14:47.723 --> 14:49.645
horizontal position. And this concept was sort of 
really confirmed by this visit. I saw that the

14:56.712 --> 15:08.023
rocks, the shatter cones pointed upward and 
therefore the force came from above, therefore it

14:56.712 --> 15:08.023
was likely caused by a cosmic impact and not by a 
force from below as from volcanism. So I then wrote

15:09.224 --> 15:16.752
this paper on this orientation of shatter cones 
and pointed out this must be a meteorite impact

15:17.525 --> 15:19.928
feature. And then I more or less forgot about this 
field, not entirely because I, when I was with ONR,

15:22.271 --> 15:35.406
I was, I didn't want to just be an administrator 
entirely. So I would, when I went to Germany, I also

15:35.446 --> 15:46.840
visited the Steinhain Basin and the Reese Basin, 
which were two examples of this type of impact

15:35.446 --> 15:46.840
feature, which we now know known to be, but were 
thought to be volcanic. And so I always took

15:48.187 --> 15:53.434
advantage of these travels to do some geology. As 
I've done on all my oceanography trips, I've

15:55.056 --> 16:01.225
always tried to do some land geology at various 
remote parts of the world.

16:04.249 --> 16:10.677
And so I wrote this paper on these shatter cones and 
the probable impact origin of these features in

16:04.249 --> 16:10.677
Germany. And along In 58 or 56 I guess the Sputnik 
thing came along and this was a big event of course

16:13.010 --> 16:39.000
scientifically and initiation of the space 
program so I

16:13.010 --> 16:39.000
at that time I visited about 58 I guess I visited I 
was invited down to the McDonald Observatory by

16:13.010 --> 16:39.000
Gerard Kuiper in Texas with Gene Schumacher and 
two other people and we were, Gene Schumacher

16:39.723 --> 16:49.455
became head of the Astrogeology program for the 
USGS. But we were looking at the moon through the

16:49.475 --> 16:57.824
telescope and I told him I thought I knew where 
there was a lunar crater on the earth. At least the

16:59.967 --> 17:01.449
counterpart. This was the Sierra Madera impact 
structure and had a certain structural style. And

17:10.621 --> 17:17.511
so we visited one day during the day because it had 
clouded over and we couldn't observe at night. And

17:18.792 --> 17:20.675
sure enough, this was a shatter cone structure. So 
this was very important, I think, in triggering

17:20.855 --> 17:30.148
the

17:20.855 --> 17:30.148
search for more of these features and for This has 
resulted in much work by the U.S. Logical Survey

17:32.140 --> 17:40.111
looking at these sites, which are, I guess, 
demonstrated now to be the lunar counterparts of

17:32.140 --> 17:40.111
lunar craters. They are terrestrial 
counterparts of lunar craters.

17:44.998 --> 17:51.647
Now, what about international cooperation on 
oceanographic voyages? I'm thinking

17:51.748 --> 17:57.115
particularly about MIDPAC and the Indian Ocean 
experience.

17:58.917 --> 18:00.038
How did you feel about this? What were your 
experiences on these voyages? Well, MIPAC, I

18:02.841 --> 18:06.004
guess, was not an international cooperation. 
This was between Scripps and the Navy.

18:12.731 --> 18:20.378
The international cooperation, I guess the first 
event there was the Indian Ocean, the

18:12.731 --> 18:20.378
International Indian Ocean Expedition.

18:23.622 --> 18:27.085
I think it was a good thing to I think oceanography 
acted as sort of the focal point for bringing

18:28.162 --> 18:40.035
countries together, particularly from behind 
the Iron Curtain. I think in the Indian Ocean

18:41.957 --> 18:51.949
Expedition, countries all really worked more or 
less separately and used this as a... The first of

18:52.089 --> 18:55.873
these things, of course, was the Second 
International Geophysical Year in 1958.

18:58.199 --> 19:13.946
And this was a mechanism of going to the highest 
levels of government, even the Congress, and

18:58.199 --> 19:13.946
getting funding because you had something which 
was big enough for them to, or a mission which was

18:58.199 --> 19:13.946
large enough for them to fund as a separate entity.

19:16.351 --> 19:20.578
And it was not a very efficient way of doing 
scientific work. it was useful in using science as

19:22.195 --> 19:33.507
a platform or as a focal point for bringing 
countries together socially and economically in

19:22.195 --> 19:33.507
other ways. But I think for the amount of money 
spent, you'd be better off to have not to do it as

19:34.688 --> 19:50.785
international projects, but just simply as 
national projects because,

19:34.688 --> 19:50.785
again, these if you go back to the Russian analogy 
of a large ship and all these programs 60, 80

19:51.811 --> 20:20.046
scientists on the ship all with different 
programs doing marine biology and this and that

19:51.811 --> 20:20.046
and other things they really don't this is not a 
very efficient way of doing doing scientific work

19:51.811 --> 20:20.046
the most efficient ships in the world doing 
scientific work for the least amount of money have

19:51.811 --> 20:20.046
been ships like the Lamont ship the

19:51.811 --> 20:20.046
uh which did purely geophysics all around the 
world. This ship has been uniquely productive.

20:32.091 --> 20:35.354
Much more important work than these huge floating 
hotels. And the same way the international work is

20:35.735 --> 20:47.927
useful for doing certain things, but it's not a 
very productive way or efficient way of getting

20:35.735 --> 20:47.927
scientific results. Would you say the same about 
mid-pack?

20:54.012 --> 20:59.337
Well, the Midpac expedition was

20:54.012 --> 20:59.337
not in its level. All involved was two other small 
ships, one Navy ship, one Scripps ship. And I was

21:05.864 --> 21:15.774
the chief scientist for the Navy group of 
scientists, and Roger Bell was the chief

21:05.864 --> 21:15.774
scientist for the Scripps ship. And I guess the 
importance of Midpac is that it it got Scripps away

21:25.113 --> 21:28.217
from coastal oceanography. It got them going 
doing deep sea. It was the first of their series of

21:30.099 --> 21:35.867
deep sea expeditions, which went on, still going 
on today. The Navy made this one effort to do it, and

21:35.907 --> 21:41.914
we had the... But then the Navy folded up the 
program. They wouldn't really give us any more

21:43.657 --> 21:54.951
support to do more or less deep sea work, except on 
this sort of, you know, continuing basis, where

21:43.657 --> 21:54.951
Scripps went on to... to doing this work, I 
identified them. We got some very good results. I

22:01.877 --> 22:08.744
mean, the main result was discovering the 
Mid-Pacific Mountains and the geos and the age of

22:01.877 --> 22:08.744
the Mid-Pacific Mountains. So, this was the 
opening wedge that got Scripps started in

22:10.105 --> 22:25.360
deep-sea oceanography, but it was abortive as far 
as the Navy is concerned, getting the Navy

22:10.105 --> 22:25.360
involved in deep-sea oceanography.

22:25.542 --> 22:42.219
Your early work on minerals in the sea, one of the 
things that you're rightly well known for, what do

22:25.542 --> 22:42.219
you look upon the sea as a potential producer of 
minerals for man?

22:42.239 --> 22:48.546
Well, the sea is somewhat disappointing.

22:53.831 --> 22:54.672
There are several aspects of the sea. One, of 
course, are the continental shelves and slopes,

22:56.878 --> 23:02.624
which are simply extensions of the land. And what 
you have on land will occur offshore, but it will be

23:03.905 --> 23:11.053
more difficult and expensive to get at. The 
important item here, of course, is the

23:12.434 --> 23:15.417
hydrocarbons. And since hydrocarbons tend to 
occur in sedimentary basins, And in young

23:22.698 --> 23:26.924
sedimentary basins, these tend to be at margins of 
continents. So the marginal regions may be very

23:28.566 --> 23:33.953
productive. Now we're getting about, I think, 
somewhere between 15 to 20% of our oil from

23:33.973 --> 23:40.462
offshore. This is bound to increase. But when we 
say offshore, we're including things like Lake

23:44.928 --> 23:50.275
Maracaibo and so forth, which are really not you 
know not open shelf

23:51.605 --> 24:20.700
as far as deep-sea concerned the only it must think 
in terms of the hydrosphere the water itself and

23:51.605 --> 24:20.700
the of course we get

23:51.605 --> 24:20.700
now we get salt magnesium bromine from seawater 
and also iodine from ocean plants uh but the the the

24:21.524 --> 24:46.198
water is uniform over the world and although it's 
nice having these standpoint of process of

24:21.524 --> 24:46.198
processing to have these these ions in solution 
they're very the the dilution is so low and so

24:21.524 --> 24:46.198
constant people talk for example of the ocean 
containing a hundred million dollars worth of

24:47.495 --> 25:15.426
gold per cubic mile an exaggeration but even if 
it's not a cubic mile of water is an enormous amount

24:47.495 --> 25:15.426
of material the total hydrocarbons oil produced 
over the years is only about one cubic mile and so

25:15.862 --> 25:23.752
Even a cubic mile of granite contains $500 million 
worth of five times as much gold as a cubic mile of

25:15.862 --> 25:23.752
seawater. But no one would think of mining just 
granite. You have to high-grade it. You have to

25:28.157 --> 25:29.098
look for the veins. Well, in the ocean water, we 
have no veins. No high-grade deposits of these

25:32.122 --> 25:34.064
things. It's all uniform. Regarding the ocean 
floor, there are, first

25:36.227 --> 25:44.417
you think in terms of the sediments, then more or 
less the ocean crust itself. now the sediments we

25:45.848 --> 26:14.218
have the the sedimentary orthogenic deposits 
like the manganese nodules and phosphorite

25:45.848 --> 26:14.218
nodules these are not ores today but one one day 
presumably will be and

25:45.848 --> 26:14.218
uh and the ocean crust itself the ocean crust 
itself is it's too bad that the oceans were

26:14.688 --> 26:22.879
generated the way they were because the ocean 
crust is just pure tholiatic basalt, ocean

26:14.688 --> 26:22.879
tholiite. This is remarkably uniform material 
and it's like trying to look for mineral deposits

26:23.980 --> 26:30.149
in Hawaii or Iceland. It's not a very good 
territory for looking for mineral deposits

26:31.631 --> 26:42.265
because to have mineral deposits you must have 
metamorphism and you'd rather have old terrain

26:42.464 --> 27:10.783
rather than young terrain you'd rather have it 
reprocessed geologically many times to develop

26:42.464 --> 27:10.783
veins and that sort of thing so the ocean is way 
overrated as a storehouse of minerals it's also

26:42.464 --> 27:10.783
way overrated as a storehouse as a cornucopia of 
food and it's not going to supply the expanding

26:42.464 --> 27:10.783
populations at all we really can't look to the 
ocean to do this this is rather a a sad story of

27:11.523 --> 27:17.233
marine geology, but that's, those are the facts. 
It's not very optimistic.

27:23.003 --> 27:36.467
I'm sure we can solve the legal hassles involved in 
recovering manganese nodules, and I'm sure that

27:23.003 --> 27:36.467
one day they will be economic, will become ours.

27:37.460 --> 28:04.682
but I'm not so optimistic as some people are about 
them I think it'll be some years before they do

27:37.460 --> 28:04.682
become economic today the only thing we are 
recovering from the only mineral resource if we

27:37.460 --> 28:04.682
use that word for recovering from the deep ocean 
floor or from seamounts is precious coral this is

27:37.460 --> 28:04.682
the only resource we have now from the deep ocean 
which is being recovered economically so really

28:05.219 --> 28:10.366
the mineral potential in the oceans is somewhat 
overrated.

28:11.347 --> 28:24.644
Of course, we do have this

28:11.347 --> 28:24.644
problem of the hydrothermal deposits, which 
we're finding in mid-ocean rifts associated with

28:11.347 --> 28:24.644
aqueous solutions, which may be economic. And we 
do also have the Red Sea situation of red sea brines

28:31.578 --> 28:46.397
and their associated deposits but this is this is a 
very unique environment we can't expect to find

28:31.578 --> 28:46.397
these brines elsewhere because it involves the 
rising of hot water solutions through giant salt

28:31.578 --> 28:46.397
deposits
