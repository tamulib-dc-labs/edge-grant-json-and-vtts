WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:14.124
That was a real exciting time, and a time to see how a 
lot of decisions are brought together with a

00:02.933 --> 00:14.124
consensus.

00:16.847 --> 00:30.240
You see where certain individuals have

00:16.847 --> 00:30.240
an influence, but in the long term it was a positive 
influence. because it was the right thing for us to

00:30.693 --> 00:46.938
do and it was something that I think brought a later 
cooperation and support from some of the

00:30.693 --> 00:46.938
political people to help this university move 
forward. And no scars. And no scars. No political

00:49.522 --> 00:51.585
public scars at all. Virtually none. You know I got 
a few letters. Oh yeah. from alumni that just were

00:56.613 --> 01:02.559
so loyal to the old Southwest Conference, but it 
was dead. It was gone, and we were riding a horse

01:02.579 --> 01:09.026
that was lame and was going to become a dead horse, 
quite honestly. When you walked in as the chief

01:09.547 --> 01:18.697
executive officer of the institution, what were 
the important matters that you had to take up right

01:09.547 --> 01:18.697
then? Well, the first one was clearly to finish up 
the investigation of the NCAA issue. The second

01:24.592 --> 01:29.057
one was to keep the momentum going in two areas. One 
was the academic priorities that we had put in

01:29.217 --> 01:33.782
place. And the second one was the endowment 
campaign. We had a lot of major requests out. And

01:40.749 --> 01:42.691
the goal was $500 million. It wound up 
successfully afterwards at more than $600

01:42.791 --> 01:47.836
million. So it was to not let that momentum get 
restricted in any way and to keep that ball

01:47.856 --> 01:54.463
rolling. On that one? I had one other one. Wait, 
wait, wait. On that campaign, does John Lindsay

01:58.740 --> 02:02.768
deserve a pat on the back? Absolutely. John 
Lindsay got a great pat on the back, and so did Bill

02:04.431 --> 02:12.708
Lone Star Gaze.

02:15.413 --> 02:16.255
I don't know. Oh, man. We'll think of it later.

02:21.325 --> 02:22.426
I'll come up with his name. Anyway, they deserved a 
tremendous pat on the back. As well as did Eddie Joe

02:26.430 --> 02:31.255
Davis, who was president of the foundation. And I 
traveled this state that year speaking to former

02:32.636 --> 02:40.284
students groups and telling them what we were 
doing. And it's real encouraging when you go share

02:41.325 --> 02:50.674
and you talk about the Aggie tradition, the Aggie 
family, the Aggie students. the Aggie Honor Code,

02:50.992 --> 02:59.424
and when you finish they give you a standing 
ovation. And you meet so many wonderful people

02:59.444 --> 03:05.592
that believe in what we're doing. Describe the 
working relationship as you saw it in action

03:05.612 --> 03:11.801
between the foundation and the institution. That 
was a very strong relationship because And I don't

03:17.283 --> 03:29.719
know a whole lot of the history prior to the time 
that Bill Mobley was president and then

03:17.283 --> 03:29.719
Chancellor and Eddie Joe Davis was the president. 
But the two of them had worked together in the

03:30.700 --> 03:37.709
Chancellor's office to the point that a 
partnership was already there. I do think that

03:38.389 --> 03:46.800
they built probably a stronger, closer 
relationship than had been there ever before. And

03:47.253 --> 04:13.282
what we did that really made a difference was that 
we put development officers in all of the

03:47.253 --> 04:13.282
colleges, and I even put one in the provost office, 
so that we could get a lot of scholarship money,

03:47.253 --> 04:13.282
that we could bring in programs that would help 
strengthen the undergraduate programs, would

03:47.253 --> 04:13.282
help recruitment of top quality students to this 
university. And I put one over in the student

04:14.183 --> 04:17.226
service side. because great opportunities for 
John Colas and later Maylyn Sutherland to build up

04:17.662 --> 04:36.863
those areas that we weren't going to get 
additional state funding and the only way that we

04:17.662 --> 04:36.863
could continue to have excellence was to bring in 
outside money. You started to add another item a

04:39.066 --> 04:44.391
while ago and I interrupted you. Other things that 
were on the table that you needed to deal with? One

04:48.693 --> 05:00.728
other major thing that was on the table was the 
requirement for multicultural

04:48.693 --> 05:00.728
courses. And I put a lot of study into that and 
determined that the agenda that was put forth was

05:02.811 --> 05:15.006
not a lot of the agenda that some people had in mind, 
and I vetoed it. And it created one big furor. I had

05:26.446 --> 05:44.605
to go meet an executive session with the faculty 
senate, and they could not believe that a

05:26.446 --> 05:44.605
president of the university had vetoed an 
academic faculty decision in the hundred and

05:26.446 --> 05:44.605
almost twenty year history of the university. I 
made the statement, well, they may not have

05:44.905 --> 05:49.510
before, but one has now. And I tried to give them my 
reasons. I doubt that they were all accepted. I had

05:58.099 --> 06:07.469
one or two other groups that I had worked so hard 
with to increase the minority students, the

05:58.099 --> 06:07.469
minority faculty. They wanted me to explain my 
reasoning why. And I think they accepted it right

06:12.214 --> 06:14.777
and well.

06:17.795 --> 06:26.563
I spent a lot of time going out into high schools 
across the state, both as senior vice president

06:17.795 --> 06:26.563
students.

06:38.092 --> 06:40.394
But that was something on my plate. I probably got 
500 letters of support to any one letter that was

06:47.343 --> 06:48.685
negative about it. Those were probably the major 
issues that were on my plate with the exception of

06:50.567 --> 07:14.295
the

06:50.567 --> 07:14.295
kinds of things that resulted after an anonymous 
letter was sent to the Dallas Morning News about

06:50.567 --> 07:14.295
suspicion of improprieties in certain areas of 
the

07:21.042 --> 07:45.733
there are questions about

07:21.042 --> 07:45.733
they did it was a board they did not think it was my 
responsibility but it was laid on my lap an issue I

07:21.042 --> 07:45.733
had to handle because there were

07:46.169 --> 07:53.998
procedures in the whole university business 
operation of the approval of those that was using

07:46.169 --> 07:53.998
the wrong terminology. And I promise you there was 
never any mal-intent. There was never, as far as I

07:58.223 --> 08:04.750
could determine, ever misuse of any funds for the 
purchase. But the codes and the titling of what was

08:05.131 --> 08:09.636
put on there was clearly wrong. So I had to deal with 
that. I inherited these things I'm telling you

08:13.020 --> 08:15.703
about. There were accusations that the contract 
of the bookstore with Barnes and Noble was not done

08:16.308 --> 08:24.316
properly. There were accusations that there were 
problems in the food service department and

08:25.878 --> 08:33.305
people had been dismissed for wrong reasons. I had 
a chemistry professor that was trying to make gold

08:34.767 --> 08:40.813
out of mercury. And they said, well, he got a gift 
that shouldn't have been given. Well, there was no

08:45.313 --> 08:48.299
way of knowing that on the front end of that gift. 
And the guy was later gotten in trouble with the

08:49.181 --> 08:52.529
FBI. But how were we to know any of that part? So, you 
know, I had a lot of those things laid on my table

08:55.556 --> 08:58.903
that It took up a tremendous amount of time just to 
straighten them out. Did any regent attempt to

09:02.971 --> 09:11.625
give you, as you began, attempt to give you 
direction, personal direction? I would not say

09:13.288 --> 09:21.381
that any regent tried to give me personal 
direction, but it was not probably uncommon for a

09:13.288 --> 09:21.381
regent to call me with a an issue that they wanted to 
see addressed. And I think that has happened for

09:25.581 --> 09:28.785
many, many years. Right. Don't name the region. 
Give some examples of the kinds of things you...

09:36.316 --> 09:41.884
Some, you know, they would get a complaint about 
something happening in a classroom or with a

09:36.316 --> 09:41.884
student. some of those kinds of things. Did they 
ever want anyone terminated? No, I never had that.

09:50.093 --> 09:54.840
Did you get any memorable phone calls in the middle 
of the night about anything? I got very few for

09:55.842 --> 09:58.706
probably one reason. I had an unlisted number and I 
did that just simply so I could get rest and sleep at

09:59.687 --> 10:05.296
night.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.403
You know, I would get a few where There was a major 
issue

10:11.193 --> 10:21.565
with a student, a tragedy, for instance, a student 
got killed. And I'm trying to recall, when you

10:21.725 --> 10:32.438
serve in three consecutive roles, sometimes 
you're not sure which role you were in when

10:21.725 --> 10:32.438
something came up. We had some instances in the 
Corps, and I would get those kinds of calls from one

10:32.839 --> 10:39.867
of the vice presidents or something. I'll tell you 
one of the most interesting calls I ever got was at

10:40.673 --> 10:50.666
the Cotton Boat. And it was from Malin Sutherland, 
who I had named as Vice President for Student

10:50.686 --> 10:59.417
Affairs. And Malin called me and he said, 
Reveille's been stolen. And I said, you gotta be

11:05.725 --> 11:08.249
kidding me. And here we are. right in the middle of 
all this Cotton Bowl celebration, and the next day

11:11.032 --> 11:19.344
is the march in with Reveille, and Reveille's been 
stolen. And we think it's by University of Texas

11:20.546 --> 11:22.870
students. That was a late night call. And so we 
began to work through all of that, and before game

11:26.976 --> 11:33.225
time, we had Reveille back. Had Reveille been 
stolen? Absolutely. She'd been stolen from the

11:36.973 --> 11:42.544
backyard of the young man in Dallas who kept her. 
And this was when she was a pup. And what had

11:45.709 --> 11:56.850
happened was the Dallas Morning News had a 
beautiful article when the new Reveille was

11:45.709 --> 11:56.850
chosen. The young man that was responsible for 
Revel, he lived in Dallas. And being Dallas, well,

12:03.723 --> 12:08.974
they made a nice article out of it and how he would be 
in charge of it. Well, some UT students apparently

12:08.994 --> 12:13.945
knew where he lived. went and stole Reveille.

12:18.919 --> 12:32.615
And they never let Reveille out of their sight 
except that morning they opened the door, let

12:18.919 --> 12:32.615
Reveille go into the fenced backyard with a high 
fence to go to the bathroom. And apparently that

12:32.635 --> 12:38.382
student must have already been hiding in the dark 
in the yard and stole Reveille. And I was on the

12:40.004 --> 12:44.269
phone to the president at UT And he was willing to 
get the bottom of it, because there'd be egg on

12:44.688 --> 12:47.791
their face. And he was so cooperative. This is 
Berdahl, who is now, I believe, president at

12:49.833 --> 12:54.237
Stanford. And he was so cooperative. And we got to 
the bottom of it before the game time.

13:02.724 --> 13:07.489
And you inherited a staff in the president's 
office. Yes, I inherited a staff in the

13:08.290 --> 13:12.113
president's office. with the exception of the 
administrative assistant to the president, and I

13:16.058 --> 13:27.273
had taken and I took with me my assistant from the 
provost office. Who's that? Sandy Crawford, and

13:27.754 --> 13:31.199
she is still there to this day. Okay, yes. And your 
office was located physically, President's

13:32.380 --> 13:36.566
office. In Rudder. In Rudder. Eighth floor. On the 
eighth floor where it is now. What are the

13:42.154 --> 13:45.238
advantages and disadvantages of that location? 
The advantages,

13:46.045 --> 13:53.397
most of all, is that it is right in the heart and 
center of campus. And you see everything around

13:54.098 --> 13:55.901
you. And you look out over the mall, you see all the 
students. But also, it's so convenient to the

13:59.507 --> 14:09.664
president's home, to the parking, and to the MSC, 
and to the board quarters, or the Board of Regents

13:59.507 --> 14:09.664
facilities. And it's central. to wherever else 
you might go on campus. The central location's a

14:15.214 --> 14:17.096
great advantage. Image-wise, it might have been 
better for it to have been in the administration

14:18.057 --> 14:32.337
building, that beautiful old chancellor's 
office that I had when I was provost, but

14:18.057 --> 14:32.337
image-wise for the students, it's better to be in 
the heart of the campus where it was.

14:38.980 --> 14:45.588
If you were going to have a small luncheon for a few 
people, where did you have it? Almost always in the

14:45.728 --> 14:48.672
Memorial Student Center. Or if it were during the 
day, usually in the Memorial Student Center.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.007
Sometimes

15:02.050 --> 15:06.656
I guess at least half of them though would be in the 
Alumni Center, in the Clayton Williams Alumni

15:02.050 --> 15:06.656
Center. And then if it were night, probably the 
President's Hall. We probably had more dinners at

15:12.443 --> 15:20.432
night that were smaller in size at the Alumni 
Center. Did you use the faculty club much? Yes, I

15:23.856 --> 15:24.517
did. I used the faculty club a good bit. for fairly 
small groups, and I forgot to mention that one. And

15:32.238 --> 15:38.486
I had a lot of real small luncheons there where I'd 
have a small group in because it's so convenient to

15:32.238 --> 15:38.486
just go to the faculty club. Plus, that is a great 
place to recruit when you can show them the entire

15:39.027 --> 15:46.797
campus by walking around. As a sidelight, I was on 
the committee to plan the rudder expansion and all

15:46.817 --> 15:55.007
that, and one of the questions that we as the 
committee threw at the architect over and over and

15:55.696 --> 16:21.387
over again and got overruled by people in building 
construction over and over, we were saying why in

15:55.696 --> 16:21.387
the world put the facility in the middle of that 
floor, why not put it off at one side and have where

15:55.696 --> 16:21.387
you could have maybe 200 people up there, make it 
where it could be divided and we got overruled over

15:55.696 --> 16:21.387
and over. Yeah, because you can't see in any one of 
those sides, a very large group at all.

16:32.948 --> 16:38.179
When did they start the search for the presidency 
on a permanent basis? Probably no later than

16:40.625 --> 16:44.974
October of 93. And was it, by the current 
standards, a normal search, meaning an

16:46.186 --> 16:52.252
advertisement and a committee? Yes, it was a 
completely normal nationwide search. Okay. And

16:57.277 --> 16:58.878
what was your desire? Well, I allowed myself. I 
knew I would be nominated. A lot of faculty and a lot

17:02.922 --> 17:15.754
of administrators

17:02.922 --> 17:15.754
even wanted the name interim probably taken off, 
but I allowed my name to go forward. But my wife and I

17:16.662 --> 17:35.986
were giving deep thought as to whether or not after 
that many years at that kind of pace and level and

17:16.662 --> 17:35.986
just the issues that we were having to face and to 
clean up, whether we really wanted to make a

17:16.662 --> 17:35.986
long-term commitment to it. And when it got past 
the interview process,

17:37.087 --> 17:45.758
we both decided that we wanted some time back 
together for our family and for us. And I notified

17:50.084 --> 17:54.248
the chairman of the committee that I was 
withdrawing.

17:56.650 --> 17:57.851
That was a tough decision. In many ways my heart 
wanted to continue to do it. But in another way, I

18:06.720 --> 18:15.829
felt like it might also be an appropriate time for 
an outside person because of a lot of the issues

18:17.648 --> 18:26.877
that I had had to work so hard to resolve. And I'm 
talking about the alcohol, food service, the

18:27.898 --> 18:33.424
NCAA, all of those. I could go on, there's a long 
list of them. There was another issue of a

18:37.388 --> 18:47.638
co-generation

18:37.388 --> 18:47.638
contract, and all of those kinds of things that 
someone, with no history of being here could step

18:48.648 --> 18:53.715
into. And I felt, I think, blessed at the end that I 
was able to resolve every one of those before I left

18:54.656 --> 19:10.117
so that I wasn't going to leave a lot of that for 
someone else. And I wondered, you know, what am I

19:11.899 --> 19:14.042
going to do? And there was an opportunity. that 
really was down my line of interest to go to the

19:18.888 --> 19:32.249
College of Business and become the director of the 
Center for Executive Development and teach an

19:18.888 --> 19:32.249
honors course in leadership. And although I could 
look back and say my discipline had been

19:33.591 --> 19:43.787
veterinary medicine, my true discipline had 
always been leadership.

19:44.629 --> 19:46.752
That's where my heart had always been. So, I really 
got excited about that being a possibility and

19:47.407 --> 19:55.898
that's what happened when we stepped out in 94. 
Alright, and so you told them that you would not be

19:56.039 --> 20:04.550
considered anymore at about what point? That was 
probably in March or April of 94. I indicated to

20:10.719 --> 20:14.764
them that I was withdrawing. and that I would 
support whomever they selected and would help

20:15.166 --> 20:24.000
that individual as much as I could. And the 
eventual choice was Ray Bowen? Correct. And as far

20:29.648 --> 20:34.155
as you know, was that the committee's 
recommendation? As far as I know, he was the

20:34.355 --> 20:37.360
committee's recommendation. And he was then the 
interim president at Oklahoma State. At Oklahoma

20:40.299 --> 20:41.000
State. Did he communicate with you soon after he 
was selected? Yes. And before he came, too, I sat

20:48.288 --> 21:05.288
down and wrote out everything I could think of that 
was on the table, that was unresolved, and sat down

20:48.288 --> 21:05.288
with him. when he first got here and went over 
everything I could think of.

21:15.396 --> 21:22.828
I don't recall if he ever asked me for any advice, 
but I could not help remember what Bill Mobley told

21:15.396 --> 21:22.828
me. I asked Bill, I said, what advice would you give 
me stepping into this role as leading this

21:25.214 --> 21:30.847
university? He said, communicate, communicate, 
communicate. And had Ray asked me, and he may have,

21:35.558 --> 21:43.797
I don't recall, I would probably have said the same 
thing. How important do you think it was and is for a

21:44.435 --> 21:56.174
Texas A&M former student to be the chief executive 
officer of this institution? Well, it's a great

21:57.116 --> 22:10.678
asset because you come with such an understanding 
and just a knowledge of all of the traditions and

21:57.116 --> 22:10.678
what a special place this is. Clearly, I think Jack 
Williams and Bill Mobley demonstrate that you

22:11.080 --> 22:21.131
don't have to be an Aggie to be a president here. 
That very quickly becomes an Aggie, but it puts you

22:21.771 --> 22:38.809
ahead of the learning curve to understand the 
values, the traditions, to understand the former

22:21.771 --> 22:38.809
students. And it clearly is an asset. There is no 
question about it. Now what topics have we not

22:43.102 --> 22:53.877
talked about in your campus-wide leadership 
months and years? You were at the campus level how

22:53.897 --> 22:57.102
from? From 89, actually the end of 88 to 94. So six 
years. Six years.

23:12.978 --> 23:30.279
I don't know, if you were to ask me what the most 
enjoyable times were, to me it would clearly be the

23:12.978 --> 23:30.279
interaction with students, former students, and 
the Mother's Club. Those were times where I could

23:32.242 --> 23:42.394
get to go and, quite frankly, tout, brag about the 
university. and to tell them what was happening

23:42.914 --> 23:52.885
and where we were going and what our vision was of 
where A&M was going. And you could see their

23:53.986 --> 24:02.776
enthusiasm, their excitement to know that here 
A&M was now the third largest university in the

23:53.986 --> 24:02.776
nation. It was one of a select designated few that 
was land grant, sea grant, and space grant. And I

24:08.923 --> 24:12.887
would tell them, to me that meant another 
obligation. that we were a public grant, a student

24:13.458 --> 24:17.866
grant, and a parent grant. Well, when I meshed 
those together with it, they could just grasp that

24:18.487 --> 24:37.761
and know that our heart was trying to maintain the 
value systems and the traditions of this

24:18.487 --> 24:37.761
university, and at the same time put in place the 
academic enhancements and programs that would

24:18.487 --> 24:37.761
elevate us to a national level that they would be 
proud to see us achieve and what part they could

24:38.433 --> 24:43.939
play in it. So those were, those were terrifically 
exciting times and I probably missed that more

24:45.021 --> 24:51.769
than any other thing. They were tiring, you know, 
when you go get on an airplane after work at six

24:51.789 --> 25:03.242
o'clock and fly to Tyler, Texas and speak and get 
back about midnight that night. It was a part of it,

25:04.403 --> 25:15.533
and I must tell you, I poured my heart and soul into 
it and gave 80, 90 hours a week to it. Any scary

25:16.253 --> 25:18.856
moments on those flights? Oh, man, did we have a 
scary one. We had gone to the opening of the new

25:21.818 --> 25:30.986
outreach center in Corpus Christi, and this was 
for the recruitment of students to Texas A&M. And

25:31.006 --> 25:32.908
on that plane was a young lady In the outreach 
office here, that was her first plane ride, and we

25:34.323 --> 25:58.710
were coming back on the University Airplane, and 
we got just this side of Caldwell, and there was a

25:34.323 --> 25:58.710
horrendous thunderstorm just, I guess, west of 
Easterwood, and the pilot thought on radar, and we

25:34.323 --> 25:58.710
were looking at the radar, that we could see a 
window through it. So he started through that

25:59.483 --> 26:02.267
window and we got sideways. And in fact, when we got 
sideways, he turned around and he said, you better

26:02.727 --> 26:08.114
tighten your seat belts. This is going to be rough. 
And he could not get through it. So he circled back

26:12.220 --> 26:14.523
and tried it one more time. And again, we got 
sideways. We flew to Austin, sat down at the state

26:16.225 --> 26:23.955
pooling board airport. for four hours to let that 
blow through before we ever got back. But that was a

26:28.083 --> 26:30.706
scary plane ride. What about celebrities that you 
met or dealt with during those six years? Oh,

26:38.056 --> 26:40.459
golly, there were a number.

26:45.366 --> 26:49.892
Chuck Norris from TV fame was here. He sat in the the 
presidents, Box, Linda Ellerby,

26:51.408 --> 27:15.525
you know, probably the ones that I have the 
greatest respect for would be George and Barbara

26:51.408 --> 27:15.525
Bush because they were so humble and just down to 
earth people and I will never forget how funny she

26:51.408 --> 27:15.525
could be. And we were over in the Board of Regents 
quarters with a reception for them one evening

27:16.265 --> 27:23.197
before a football weekend. And the Board of 
Regents and MSC quarters have always been known as

27:25.200 --> 27:32.253
having great air conditioning. And I must admit, 
it was cool in there. But you turn it down pretty

27:34.637 --> 27:37.301
cool because you get all the people in there. 
Bill's up. She was there. And it was pretty cold

27:38.827 --> 27:45.956
that night, and she comes up to me, and I was provost 
at the time, and she says, I want to ask you

27:38.827 --> 27:45.956
something. And I said, yes, ma'am. She said, is a 
provost supposed to save money for the

27:48.559 --> 27:52.183
university? And I said, yes, ma'am, every chance I 
can get. She said, well, why don't you go tell them

27:54.626 --> 27:57.870
to turn the air conditioning up? And that was just 
her way. Let's see, any sessions with the

28:03.297 --> 28:08.023
governor, one-on-one or almost one-on-one? 
Yeah, I had a number of sessions with Ann Richards,

28:08.172 --> 28:13.820
who was the governor at the time. And she had us 
being the leadership of the university over to the

28:14.281 --> 28:23.674
mansion for a dinner one night. And that was a 
one-on-one. And then we had, as I recall, two or

28:25.076 --> 28:33.688
three separate meetings just one-on-one with 
certain kinds of issues that we were facing. I'll

28:33.749 --> 28:36.913
tell you, another one is when we were trying to get 
appropriations through the highway department

28:37.703 --> 28:43.252
to widen George Bush Boulevard. I went with a group 
of business leaders from the community and we met

28:44.895 --> 28:53.248
with her asking her if she would help us with funds 
that were already into the Highway Department to

28:53.870 --> 29:01.699
get it allocated to be able to forlain it because we 
were now going to get the George Bush Library. And

29:02.400 --> 29:06.344
she came along with it. Did you get any impression 
of how she felt about A&M in general? I think she had

29:12.912 --> 29:21.902
respect for A&M, but probably the conservative

29:23.148 --> 29:34.526
nature and voting record of this university more 
toward Republican, her greater loyalty would

29:23.148 --> 29:34.526
probably have been to the University of Texas. But 
she was always very respectful and I think had a

29:35.247 --> 29:48.447
great deal of admiration for this university.

29:49.321 --> 29:53.105
She gave a commencement address, so we were with 
her at that time. In fact, when you're senior vice

29:53.145 --> 30:05.678
president and provost, one of your 
responsibilities at commencement is to

29:53.145 --> 30:05.678
entertain the speaker after the speaker has 
spoken and all the students are going across. So I

30:06.920 --> 30:11.184
spent a good bit of time in conversation when she 
spoke. That brings up another thing that happened

30:13.006 --> 30:16.510
when I was Senior Vice President, Provost.

30:23.325 --> 30:33.920
We always, those of us on stage, got into the 
Letterman's Lounge in G. Raleigh White about 10

30:23.325 --> 30:33.920
minutes before the procession. And this was on a 
Saturday morning and we didn't have a meal

30:35.482 --> 30:40.328
beforehand. So we just came directly from home to 
G. Raleigh White. And I got there. about 10 minutes

30:46.949 --> 30:51.593
till 9 when we were to robe and proceed in. And I walk 
in, and everybody looks at me. And they point at me,

30:56.958 --> 31:04.285
and Bill Mobley says, the speaker for 
commencement this morning is fogged in in Austin.

31:04.826 --> 31:05.346
You're on. Well, you can imagine what I thought. 
And I had given a lot of speeches. I thought, what in

31:14.708 --> 31:16.832
the world am I going to do? So I said, okay. I said, 
but I need to run to my office, which was over on the

31:20.378 --> 31:31.519
administration building, way across campus, and 
be able to go in and get an old speech, and maybe I can

31:20.378 --> 31:31.519
write it.
