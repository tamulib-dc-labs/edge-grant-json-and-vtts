00:01.448 --> 00:02.289
This is a test. Today's date is March 10th, 1981. 
This is an interview with Dean George Shelton.

00:18.356 --> 00:22.663
This

00:18.356 --> 00:22.663
is an interview. Well, George Shelton, Dean of the 
College of Veterinary Medicine, today's date is

00:23.352 --> 00:29.018
Tuesday, March 10th, 1981. Let's start with your 
personal background. Can you tell us about your

00:30.840 --> 00:34.984
early years in Steavenville, Texas? Yes, I grew up 
in Steavenville, Texas in the Depression years

00:35.985 --> 00:51.300
and on a small farm south of Steavenville and 
completed high school at Steavenville High

00:35.985 --> 00:51.300
School. And then attended what was then a branch of 
Texas A&M University called John Tarleton

00:52.360 --> 01:01.531
Agricultural College in those days. And you tell 
us about your parents. Let's slow down here for a

01:03.453 --> 01:04.775
minute. All right. My parents were farm people. 
And my father was a small farmer, mixed farming, a

01:07.979 --> 01:21.996
little bit of everything, dairy and row crops, 
peanuts.

01:23.495 --> 01:26.198
my mother was just a farm wife, housewife. I had one 
sister who was seven years younger than, five

01:27.459 --> 01:42.474
years younger than I, and she also completed high 
school at Stephenville and then went on to John

01:27.459 --> 01:42.474
Tarleton for two years. What kind of education did 
your parents have? My parents were, had only a

01:46.118 --> 01:49.582
grade school education. They completed Oh, 
something like seventh grade, something of that

01:51.507 --> 01:55.974
period. They had lived in

01:56.554 --> 02:03.625
the Stephenville area most of their life. My 
mother came from East Texas, grew up around

02:04.486 --> 02:16.063
Sulphur Springs, and then they had lived on farms 
around Stephenville for most of their life. No,

02:18.237 --> 02:20.900
you grew up during the Depression. What was the 
impact of the Depression on you and on your family?

02:26.566 --> 02:46.489
Well, it was a fairly drastic impact, although in 
those days it wasn't as severe as a Depression

02:26.566 --> 02:46.489
would be today because we lived on a 200-acre farm 
and we weren't affected very much by the energy

02:46.722 --> 02:52.467
problem because we didn't have all that much 
energy. In the early years, we didn't even have

02:53.148 --> 02:55.891
electricity. And then after the REA came into the 
communities, we did get electricity. But in the

03:01.736 --> 03:11.205
very heart of the Depression, we were still using 
draft animals, horses and mules to farm with. And

03:12.627 --> 03:16.290
so while the depression hurt as far as having money 
for capital development. It didn't really hurt

03:25.534 --> 03:30.561
all that much as far as our life was concerned. We 
always had food and we didn't have much money, but

03:32.184 --> 03:39.635
then very few people did. We always had the 
essentials, food, clothing, and shelter.

03:49.367 --> 03:52.491
Clothing might not have been too good, but we 
always had it. And so our life was not drastically

03:53.693 --> 04:05.530
affected by the Depression, except there just was 
no growth, no capital development. And every year

04:05.550 --> 04:08.254
was sort of like the last one. The worst year I can 
remember was 1934,

04:15.147 --> 04:19.072
the drought hit so bad in that area of Texas, well 
all over Texas. That year was rough. Did you grow

04:22.698 --> 04:23.699
anything? We grew almost nothing except some 
vegetables and foodstuff, but we had nothing to

04:24.620 --> 04:31.910
sell that year. There was no sales because we 
didn't produce anything. It was lucky to keep

04:39.541 --> 04:42.245
going. It was lucky to keep fed, probably. And 
fortunately, we lived in a sandy area where we did

04:44.965 --> 05:01.622
raise some vegetables, and we were able to get a 
little bit of a hay crop before it got so terribly

04:44.965 --> 05:01.622
hot and dry. So we survived 1934, but it was a bad 
year. That was the year that the federal

05:05.766 --> 05:14.095
government began to start so many social or 
socioeconomic programs to one that I remember

05:14.378 --> 05:31.760
that had some bearing on me as a small boy was the

05:14.378 --> 05:31.760
government bought cattle under some kind of a 
federal program. They actually would take so many

05:31.800 --> 05:43.474
of the cattle that the farmer had and they just dig 
long trenches somewhere in the countryside and

05:31.800 --> 05:43.474
shoot the cattle. and pay something like $8 or $10 a 
piece for them. And while that today, it reduced

05:49.080 --> 06:00.695
the supply of cattle and gave the farmer a little 
bit of capital. By today's standards, nothing.

06:02.137 --> 06:06.222
But in those days, $10 was Kind of an unbelievable 
amount of money. Concerning bacon, went for a

06:09.644 --> 06:12.547
nickel a pound. Yeah. So the prices, too, on the 
other end of the farmer, they must have just really

06:14.389 --> 06:23.240
hurt you as far as the devaluation of prices for 
selling your farm crops. Value, almost.

06:29.226 --> 06:30.728
Products were just not worth much. But 
surprisingly enough, people did survive.

06:38.433 --> 06:42.497
because their standards of living were so much 
lower than today. I didn't expect much. Today,

06:44.759 --> 06:59.694
I suppose anyone my age that remembers the Great 
Depression, and I was small, but I remember it very

06:44.759 --> 06:59.694
vividly. Of course, we didn't really get out of it 
until about 1938 to 40. But I can remember the years

07:04.792 --> 07:09.558
of 34, 35 very well. And anyone that remembers 
those days can't help but suddenly sometimes stop

07:10.940 --> 07:19.611
and think, what would happen if that happened 
today? Where would people go? You know, when,

07:23.116 --> 07:34.731
what, 80% or 70% to 80% of our people live in huge 
urban areas like Houston, Dallas, and Los

07:23.116 --> 07:34.731
Angeles. What would those people do? I really 
don't know. Now in those, in 1934, I suppose 70 or

07:41.275 --> 07:53.349
80% of the people lived in small towns and rural, 
and on little farms. And I suppose in that time, we

07:55.010 --> 08:04.161
still probably had better than six to seven 
million farms. But the call farms wouldn't be

08:05.542 --> 08:15.231
farmed by today's standards, but

08:05.542 --> 08:15.231
at least the people were out where they could get 
food. The people that were heard in the 32 to 36 era

08:15.251 --> 08:30.385
were the people in New York City and Chicago and the 
bread lines. They had no food. No jobs, no money.

08:35.242 --> 08:39.827
What influence did your parents have on you?

08:40.368 --> 08:50.740
I guess, well, a very, very positive influence 
because my parents were always dedicated to the

08:40.368 --> 08:50.740
importance of education. They believed that a 
young person, myself and my sister, the only

08:51.921 --> 09:04.455
chance that we had for a good life or a better life 
was through education. Even though they didn't

09:05.178 --> 09:06.340
have any. Even though their education was 
relatively poor, relatively limited. They both

09:11.326 --> 09:16.933
were very, very devoted to the importance of 
education. How can you account for that? Was it

09:18.796 --> 09:20.098
part of the American dream? I think it was part of 
the American dream for that time, and I don't think

09:20.178 --> 09:29.710
my parents were all that much different from their 
peers, their contemporaries. I think that people

09:30.692 --> 09:34.797
on the small farms of Middle America in those days 
valued education. Most of them had

09:40.120 --> 09:49.874
people the age of my mother and father, a high 
school education was considered pretty

09:40.120 --> 09:49.874
outstanding. That's certainly better than a 
college degree today, in that day. So while they

09:59.227 --> 10:04.294
didn't have a lot of education, they had enough to 
know the importance I guess that's how I would put

10:05.371 --> 10:08.154
it. They were hardworking people, Christian 
people dedicated to the basic values, moral

10:08.174 --> 10:15.541
values of America. And they were upward motivated 
in the sense that they wanted a better life for us

10:17.083 --> 10:27.834
than they had. So yes, they had a positive 
influence, very definitely.

10:34.143 --> 10:51.967
My father was a strict disciplinarian who, while 
he was always reasonable and understanding with

10:34.143 --> 10:51.967
me, I knew what he

10:34.143 --> 10:51.967
expected of me, too.

10:55.152 --> 10:57.094
So they had a very positive effect. And is that why 
you decided to go to college then? I guess I never

11:01.497 --> 11:04.482
thought about anything else. I never recall ever 
having any other goal. Now, I didn't know that I

11:11.894 --> 11:19.466
would go on to finish a professional degree and a 
PhD and all that kind of stuff. You know, I didn't

11:19.927 --> 11:21.890
know what that was in those days. But I always knew 
that I was going to get a college degree. I'd finish

11:27.940 --> 11:30.784
high school, and somehow I'd get a college degree. 
So when you finished high school, there really

11:30.804 --> 11:34.208
wasn't another alternative for you. I never 
considered one. You had just decided, yeah. I

11:36.611 --> 11:37.973
never considered one. I just immediately 
enrolled there. Of course, we had the advantage of

11:39.735 --> 11:46.584
being able to live at home and go to that junior 
college for two years, which I did. I lived at home.

11:47.505 --> 11:48.867
I didn't move to the city. I continued to work on the 
farm. I'd get up and hand milk. In those days... a

11:57.708 --> 12:02.013
dozen cows before going to school in the morning. 
After school, I went home. Those two years of

12:04.875 --> 12:22.974
college were sort of an extension of high school 
for me because I would go,

12:04.875 --> 12:22.974
I pretty much followed the same pattern of life 
those two years of college that I did in high

12:04.875 --> 12:22.974
school. And I continued to work and to earn as much 
of my way as I could. I worked on the, I generally

12:29.030 --> 12:39.084
worked on the farm in the summer, but summer of 1940 
and 41, I did work for the REA. Really? Through the

12:40.385 --> 12:44.631
summer to earn a little extra money. Putting up 
telephone poles, wires, and stuff like that?

12:47.195 --> 12:48.416
Yeah. Bringing electricity out to the farms? 
That's right, yeah. That was in adding there.

12:54.645 --> 12:56.267
Maybe not all. These were just extra jobs. Yeah, a 
government job. Was a government job hard to get?

13:01.656 --> 13:02.738
Well, they had loosened up. They weren't so hard to 
get by 40, 39, 40, 41. No, they had been. Well,

13:10.931 --> 13:13.435
they'd been impossible to get back in the early 
30s. But by the late 30s and early 40s, no, you could

13:15.078 --> 13:21.529
get jobs. You know, I saw the Grapes of Wrath about a 
month ago again, and the whole idea of the

13:22.420 --> 13:39.361
government was a very benevolent type 
government, and today we have so many politicians

13:22.420 --> 13:39.361
blaming Washington for this and blaming 
Washington for that. Would you agree with that?

13:40.342 --> 13:46.189
Did it seem back then that it was a positive force in 
American history? I thought so. Because having

13:51.833 --> 14:06.653
having a memory over the spectrum of years and the 
federal programs,

13:51.833 --> 14:06.653
I'm sort of a pro-Roosevelt person. I realize that 
on through the next 40 years some of the federal

14:06.873 --> 14:16.225
programs and the idea that the government could do 
everything is carried way too far. But I still take

14:20.065 --> 14:29.659
issue with people that are too critical of 
Roosevelt for the, what do you call it, the Great

14:20.065 --> 14:29.659
Society, or that wasn't it, but... New Deal. The 
New Deal, yeah. The Great Society was LBJ. Yes,

14:35.528 --> 14:36.830
that's LBJ. But it's all a continuation of the 
spectrum. And the New Deal, as far as I'm

14:41.256 --> 14:48.807
concerned, was a very positive and a very good 
force. And I would tend to think that if Roosevelt

14:49.968 --> 14:58.475
was the kind of man that would have seen, after a 
while it was going too far. Because I was a

15:00.457 --> 15:02.439
respecter of Roosevelt. I thought he was a 
brilliant man. I realize that there's some things

15:05.621 --> 15:14.028
that history maybe shows that he might have been 
wrong and maybe did wrong. But I certainly thought

15:14.069 --> 15:19.333
that his New Deal was a positive effort, and 
overall it was positive. There's so many things

15:26.475 --> 15:31.822
like the GI Bill of Rights. When you try to balance 
the strong against the good against the bad, boy,

15:31.842 --> 15:38.170
it wins out hands down. And I tend to think the New 
Deal did, too. The government effort to get the

15:42.175 --> 15:45.399
country moving forward again. I surely see that It 
was overdone, and it's been carried too far in

15:49.132 --> 15:52.255
places. And of course, we all know that some of 
those federal programs like the REA and several

15:54.317 --> 16:06.991
things, you know, perhaps Roosevelt tried to 
stack the Supreme Court. I guess he did, you know.

16:09.413 --> 16:16.641
And he probably went too far in some of those 
because that might have been almost dictatorial.

16:17.363 --> 16:20.707
There was a need to move the country forward in 
1932. Yeah, for sure. By some means

16:22.829 --> 16:26.674
or other. Now when you were at junior college, did 
you have any idea that you wanted to become a

16:26.714 --> 16:32.720
veterinarian? Yes, yes I did. There

16:34.382 --> 16:46.476
was a veterinarian in Stephenville by the name of 
Vern Scott who had been to my father's farm all

16:46.523 --> 16:49.266
through the years since I was big enough to 
remember. He was a very strong force on so many

16:50.567 --> 16:59.295
young men in the area of Stephenville in those 
years. I suppose contributed to a dozen or 20 young

17:00.076 --> 17:08.363
people coming to Texas A&M to study veterinary 
medicine. Was he an A&M grad? No, he wasn't. Well,

17:12.868 --> 17:14.269
let me back up. He was an A&M graduate, but he 
received his veterinary degree from the old

17:14.738 --> 17:24.733
private school in Kansas City, Kansas City 
Veterinary College. But Dr. Scott had finished

17:25.134 --> 17:27.798
A&M in animal husbandry. And that was along about 
the time the new school was started here. And for

17:34.147 --> 17:37.833
whatever reason, he did not go to veterinary 
school here, but went to Kansas City. But he was an

17:39.175 --> 17:42.400
A&M grad and a strong supporter of A&M. And he was a 
good image, a flamboyant, strong personality,

17:43.932 --> 17:52.481
strong will. And he taught animal science or 
animal husbandry at Tarleton. Oh, he did. So he was

17:58.287 --> 17:59.568
a vet and he taught. He was a practicing 
veterinarian. He was a practicing veterinarian

18:01.670 --> 18:05.634
and taught part time there in the school. He had 
what in those days was an ideal job. He had the best

18:09.018 --> 18:12.201
of all worlds. Yes, he was. So he was a strong 
influence. What's your background? Did that play

18:17.003 --> 18:19.966
a role since you came from a farm? I don't know what 
hit you. I'm not sure. For you, what about your

18:24.451 --> 18:26.112
background? Was that another factor? Oh, I think 
so, yes. I was going to spend my life somewhere in

18:30.216 --> 18:37.964
the agricultural industry, either in the animal 
science or plant science, somewhere. I knew that

18:38.465 --> 18:42.829
from, you know, I'm sure that was a factor. then Dr. 
Scott probably was a positive influence to go into

18:43.838 --> 18:49.624
the animal side of things. And even in 1941, when I 
started to Tarleton, perhaps I

18:51.125 --> 19:08.023
think I wanted to be a veterinarian then, but I 
didn't know if I could ever get through. I didn't

19:08.063 --> 19:10.545
know what the finances would be. I knew it would be 
terribly expensive By my standards, by the monies

19:14.247 --> 19:19.093
I had, it would be difficult to come to Texas A&M. So 
in 1941, I took the pre-veterinary curriculum at

19:19.113 --> 19:26.061
Tarleton, but I didn't know if I'd ever get through 
or not. I hoped to, and I planned to, but those days

19:27.222 --> 19:38.655
were a little different than today because of the 
loan programs that are available to young people.

19:38.895 --> 19:41.318
We didn't have any loan programs available to us. 
So we had to earn our own way. Our parents had to find

19:43.946 --> 19:45.548
the money. I didn't know whether I could get 
through or not. My goal was sort of a short term, to

19:49.313 --> 19:58.265
get through Tarleton, finish the pre-vet 
requirement, and then cross the next bridge when I

19:49.313 --> 19:58.265
got there. And when you were at Tarleton, was that 
for two years? I know you went in the Army Air Force

20:02.912 --> 20:04.794
in 1942. So were you done with your pre-vet 
curriculum? Yes. See, I started at Tarleton in the

20:10.998 --> 20:16.064
fall of 1941, and the war broke out in December. 
They immediately switched to an accelerated

20:16.904 --> 20:19.387
program. Oh, I see. So by December of 1942, I had 
essentially completed two years' work.

20:30.199 --> 20:33.563
I looked then at the possibility of coming on to 
Texas A&M. They had at that time what was called an

20:33.603 --> 20:40.110
ASTP program, Army Specialized Training 
Program. And I looked into that, came to Texas A&M,

20:41.575 --> 20:52.927
talked to some of the young veterinary students at 
the time, and everything was so terribly

20:41.575 --> 20:52.927
uncertain. In December 1942, they had stopped 
enlistments. You could no longer enlist in any of

21:00.915 --> 21:04.159
the armed services. Everybody was being drafted 
because they were getting lopsided situations.

21:10.499 --> 21:30.307
Some people wanted to enlist in this force or that 
force, so you had to go on through the draft, and I

21:10.499 --> 21:30.307
elected to, then I went back home at Christmas 
time, and I elected to go on in the draft because I

21:10.499 --> 21:30.307
didn't think I could ever get through here. People 
were being called up almost every day. Oh, really?

21:33.571 --> 21:38.498
It was a demoralized crew, you know. You didn't 
know if you'd be in school one more week or one more

21:39.035 --> 21:42.518
year. Now, some students did stay in school and did 
finish. But I elected to go on. So I went home about,

21:48.945 --> 21:53.930
oh, I don't know, I suppose it was 15th or 20th of 
December. And I went down to the draft board and

21:55.371 --> 22:03.599
told them, you know, I wasn't going to apply for an 
extension because I wasn't going on to A&M. You

22:03.619 --> 22:05.481
could apply for an extension. a delay, really, I 
say extension, a delay of the draft. So I went home

22:11.969 --> 22:15.072
and told them I wasn't going to. They were happy to 
hear that. Yeah, they announced at Tarleton just

22:18.855 --> 22:31.468
before Christmas that anybody that was drafted 
over the holidays would not have to take final

22:18.855 --> 22:31.468
exams. And I thought, well, if I'm going on this 
service, I don't want to take the final exam. So I

22:36.979 --> 22:41.846
went out to the draft board and told them I wasn't 
going to ask for a delay. So, man, they moved fast. I

22:45.071 --> 22:53.423
went to Camp Barkley, I believe it was what they 
called it, in Abilene and was inducted into the

22:45.071 --> 22:53.423
Army on December 29th. They didn't delay. It's 
kind of unbelievable. How'd you get in the Army Air

22:59.680 --> 23:00.942
Force? Did you apply for that? They assigned me. 
Oh, they just assigned you. What was your job? We

23:05.708 --> 23:08.132
had no choice. You didn't know if you were going to 
infantry or Navy or Marines or where. So we went to

23:15.782 --> 23:22.752
Camp Walters, I think about the 3rd of January of 
1943. We were inducted and sent home for three days

23:23.592 --> 23:31.322
or so, a weekend kind of thing, and then reported to 
Camp Walters. I went through an induction center

23:32.544 --> 23:39.012
there, and the first thing I knew, I'd been signed 
to the Air Force. But I had no idea where I was going.

23:40.995 --> 23:45.160
Did they train you, or did they give you a job? No, we 
went through a brief orientation at Camp Walters,

23:45.681 --> 23:52.570
sent me to Shepherd Field, Texas, to the Air Force 
base. and a very brief basic training program

23:53.393 --> 24:01.004
there, something like two months. And then I went 
to Scottfield, Illinois for radio operator

24:02.166 --> 24:10.458
gunnery school. I had applied for pilot's 
training, but failed to pass the physical exam

24:10.478 --> 24:22.776
because of an eye problem, a little bit of a 
defective eye problem. I don't know whether that

24:23.819 --> 24:30.629
was really it or whether they had more people 
applying for pilot training than they needed.

24:30.649 --> 24:31.570
There probably were quite a few. Yes. So anyhow, I 
went on to Scott Field in radio operator gunnery

24:32.592 --> 24:38.100
school. Completed there with

24:39.022 --> 24:45.211
radio operator mechanic school, they called it. 
And then from there to gunnery school in

24:45.231 --> 24:51.480
Las Vegas, Nevada. and then to what they call a 
replacement training unit for gunnery crew or

24:52.253 --> 25:02.988
aircraft crew along by November of that year. And 
then I was ready to take a place in replacement crew

25:03.549 --> 25:10.639
training. See, the war was hot and heavy in both the 
Pacific and in Europe by that time, late 1943,

25:11.580 --> 25:19.932
early 1944. And so I went through replacement 
training unit in Myrtle Beach, or in Columbia and

25:21.110 --> 25:32.601
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and then was 
shipped to the Pacific in early 1944. Whereabouts

25:32.621 --> 25:35.023
in the South Pacific? Well, almost the whole 
thing. I started, of course, I reported to the

25:37.946 --> 25:50.357
Solomon Islands in Guadalcanal area, then was 
immediately moved to New Guinea and went through

25:37.946 --> 25:50.357
all the New Guinea campaigns. or most of it, and 
then on up through the Philippines, and I

25:50.624 --> 26:03.119
completed my tour of duty just about the time the 
Philippine War was over. It was all pretty well

26:04.481 --> 26:18.538
under control, and I left the Philippines in late 
April, early May 1945, and everybody- Did you

26:04.481 --> 26:18.538
occupy Japan? I didn't go on to Japan. They sent me 
home, and then I was ready to be reassigned to, I had

26:20.603 --> 26:33.559
flown on medium bombers in all the New Guinea, 
Philippine campaign. And so when they sent me home

26:33.579 --> 26:42.410
for what they call rest and rehabilitation leave, 
and I would have been reassigned to B-29s. Those

26:43.051 --> 26:45.033
were the big superfortress. They dropped the 
bombs. Yeah. And then in August, 1945, when the war

26:49.417 --> 26:59.971
ended, I'm sure I would have reported to B-29 
training program. If the war had not ended in

27:01.413 --> 27:06.660
Europe, I would have reported by the middle of 1st 
of September. And so you didn't have any leave for

27:08.182 --> 27:10.545
about two years then? You had no leave for about two 
years? Oh, minor leave, a week or so. But you never

27:16.957 --> 27:19.880
got home for a couple of years, and that's why they 
sent you back. No, they gave me a week, about a week

27:20.000 --> 27:26.246
or ten days, when I came back from Pacific. That was 
in May, June 1945. Then they assigned me to

27:30.971 --> 27:37.518
Ellington Field in Houston. I was more or less in a 
delayed program there. They were thinking about

27:42.539 --> 27:44.662
what they're going to do with it. Yeah, well, of 
course, they anticipated. They knew the war was

27:46.644 --> 27:52.571
over against Germany, and they anticipated 
another year and a half. Oh, yeah. I think the

27:52.872 --> 28:03.505
feeling, at least it got down to us, the feeling was 
that the war with Japan would last another year, 18

27:52.872 --> 28:03.505
months. And I certainly didn't agree with it. I had 
been through all the New Guinea and Philippine

28:06.088 --> 28:11.955
campaign, and they didn't quit. You just had to 
kill the last one. And I assumed it would take a

28:15.594 --> 28:21.399
year,

28:15.594 --> 28:21.399
18 months. Now when you came back from the war, were 
your plans to go to Texas A&M? Or how did that- You

28:28.666 --> 28:31.608
know, it's kind of ironic there. When I came back in 
45, I really never thought much about it because I

28:32.709 --> 28:42.178
didn't really think the war was over. So I never 
gave much thought. And it wasn't until about

28:45.270 --> 28:54.701
mid-August that I did, because I think the war 
ended in Japan about the 14th of August, something

28:45.270 --> 28:54.701
like that. And all of a sudden, what am I going to do 
here? I hadn't really thought much about it. Oh, I

28:59.907 --> 29:06.174
guess sometimes in bull sessions in the barracks 
or somewhere, I'd like to. At that time, they began

29:06.434 --> 29:09.718
to talk about the GI Bill. Well, if I can qualify for 
the GI Bill, I think I'll go to Texas A&M and try to

29:10.222 --> 29:19.713
get in vet school. And so as late as the middle of 
August, I hadn't thought much about it. And then

29:27.743 --> 29:29.625
all of a sudden, I did. So when the war ended, we 
still assumed that it would be several months

29:31.327 --> 29:40.077
before we could be mustered out. word to use then. 
And I really recall a time or two thinking that I'd

29:43.055 --> 30:01.653
come up to Texas A&M, I was down there in Houston, 
and talk to the school, but things began to move so

29:43.055 --> 30:01.653
fast, you know, after that, and all of a sudden 
realized that, man, we may get out of here. So the

30:03.155 --> 30:08.680
war ended on August the 14th, and I was discharged 
on September 22nd. That's tremendous. It started

30:11.150 --> 30:13.734
at the Veterinary School here on September 27th. 
Really? But tell me about when you came up and

30:17.058 --> 30:21.865
getting admitted in five days. Well, I had kind of 
a, I guess I was lucky. Number one in the mustering

30:30.556 --> 30:38.667
out process, I had been through a lot of battle 
zones and had flown in several battle areas. I'd

30:39.372 --> 30:51.911
been, I'd received, as everybody in the Air Force 
did, a number of medals and awards and so forth that

30:39.372 --> 30:51.911
they gave you points for. Yeah. So suddenly, I 
found I had enough points to be mustered out early.

30:59.301 --> 31:02.686
And so I concentrated on getting out for a few days. 
And then... When they discharged me, my home was in

31:06.457 --> 31:13.306
Stephenville, and I was released at Ellington 
Field. And I had purchased a little car back in the

31:13.326 --> 31:22.898
summer, that summer after coming back from 
Europe, I mean the Pacific. I purchased a little

31:22.919 --> 31:24.260
car. It was an old 36 Plymouth, I remember it. And I 
couldn't keep it running because there was

31:28.766 --> 31:32.070
something wrong with it all the time. It had 
150,000 on it, I guess. But anyway, I got it to run

31:35.212 --> 31:39.219
enough that I started home. So I stopped by here at 
the college on the way home. And that would have

31:43.707 --> 31:46.652
been like the 23rd or so. And went over to see Dean 
Marsteller, who was dean at the college at the

31:48.114 --> 31:56.308
time.
