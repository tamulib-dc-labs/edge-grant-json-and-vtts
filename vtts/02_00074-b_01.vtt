WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:06.737
Describe a football weekend. When did the 
activities begin and take me through a weekend?

00:12.626 --> 00:22.100
Well, for those of us that didn't have dates, and 
most of the time we didn't, you know, the same four

00:12.626 --> 00:22.100
of us used to go to the ball games. We'd sit, you 
know, wherever. But did you go to anything on

00:23.662 --> 00:26.567
Friday night? We always had midnight yell 
practice. Describe midnight yell practice.

00:31.314 --> 00:32.355
Where did it occur? At the Grove. We went to the 
Grove on Midnight Yale practice, and we already

00:33.545 --> 00:55.498
were, we would stay around Friday night, and even 
as upperclassmen, there weren't a whole lot of

00:33.545 --> 00:55.498
places to go and do, unless you went to a movie or the 
legal drinking age of 21, and so, you know, we

00:33.545 --> 00:55.498
didn't, there wasn't the, I guess Uncle Ed's was 
there and a couple other places, but number one, we

00:33.545 --> 00:55.498
didn't have the money to go do that. Did, all right, 
at the Grove, did y'all do the yells and the songs,

00:55.518 --> 01:00.947
and were there fables? Absolutely. And the 
moments when someone was speaking, I remember

01:02.536 --> 01:09.465
when Bear Bryant spoke at one. I remember when 
other, of course the Yell leaders would always

01:09.486 --> 01:17.837
carry it, but I guess the one I remember the most was 
when Bear Bryant spoke. But that was, of course we

01:18.057 --> 01:29.573
also had during the week, if it was a away game on 
Tuesday and Thursday night after mess hall, After

01:30.177 --> 01:38.089
dinner, we would go to the Grove and have a Yale 
practice on Tuesday and Thursday during football

01:30.177 --> 01:38.089
season. Right after summer? Right after summer. 
And then, of course, but not when it was a home game.

01:43.578 --> 01:46.122
We didn't go on Thursday, which ended in a Yale 
practice. And we would, you know, line up at the,

01:46.142 --> 01:54.936
arm and arm to the Grove and the band, I guess the 
band led it. I could be confused with what I see

01:57.211 --> 02:01.495
today, but I'm sure they did. Yeah, of course, they 
had to. We had all the songs, the normal songs that

02:02.657 --> 02:10.184
we sang and everything else. So they were 
sometimes, of course, you've got to make people

02:10.324 --> 02:17.051
yell. And I guess they made us yell to break the 
shyness of yelling like freshmen and posture. You

02:25.814 --> 02:27.956
learn that at football games, too. But that's just 
for the first two or three, and then pretty much

02:27.976 --> 02:32.040
leave it alone. And once you get it and do it right, 
nobody knows. Were there any Korean War veterans

02:35.904 --> 02:40.688
that you remember much?

02:43.111 --> 02:50.578
There were a lot of veterans, because the student 
body was about half Corps, of the 7,000 plus,

02:43.111 --> 02:50.578
7,500, 3,500. We had 3,000, 3,500.

02:55.278 --> 02:56.079
strength core. My brother was back. See, Gus 
returned to A&M mid-semester of my freshman year.

03:07.737 --> 03:12.665
And he and I went to college together, even though 
he was my older brother. Because when, see he was 15

03:12.685 --> 03:16.251
when he graduated from high school. And then he 
went to A&M. My dad didn't let him go off until He

03:20.422 --> 03:24.988
stayed at Loretta Junior College for either a year 
or a semester, I can't remember. Probably a

03:25.008 --> 03:26.270
semester. And then when he was 16, he went up in Frog 
Den. And he was, I guess, immature. And they asked

03:33.679 --> 03:37.384
him to go home and grow up a little bit, and he joined 
the Air Force. And after four years in the Air

03:38.105 --> 03:46.716
Force, he got out right at my first semester 
freshman, and he came back in. I saw a lot of the

03:47.202 --> 03:50.725
veterans because my brother was a veteran. He 
wasn't a Korean veteran, but he was a veteran. And

03:55.850 --> 03:56.931
they were mainly quiet. They screwed the curves up 
because they were serious about studying. Where

04:01.135 --> 04:02.456
did they live? Puryear and Law and the non-core 
dorms. They were also in one of the, let me see, it

04:11.225 --> 04:16.770
was 14, 15, 16, and 18. Were you all aware of many 
married veterans, many married students? They

04:21.007 --> 04:29.076
were, and they were in the apartments that were 
in... College View? Yeah, College View. There's

04:30.037 --> 04:31.178
one over here and one over there. And the project 
house is down south. Yeah, two different places.

04:34.142 --> 04:36.364
And there were a lot of married students. And they 
were serious students, and they pretty much...

04:36.484 --> 04:42.511
What school? Describe... your routine in going to 
and from home to College Station? How'd you get

04:50.158 --> 04:51.039
there? Well, once Gus was there, when we went home, 
Gus had a car. So hitchhiking days were over.

04:57.129 --> 04:58.752
Describe hitchhiking, though. Hitchhiking? 
Well, the line, you know, you go, even though...

04:59.853 --> 05:08.467
Now where was the place, if you're coming in this 
direction? Where did you get the...

05:13.720 --> 05:16.703
The road that runs out through North, what is that? 
21? Yeah, but you have to go 50-60 or 60-50. I never

05:21.108 --> 05:22.950
could remember. Across the railroad tracks right 
there, across the tracks on the street that runs in

05:22.970 --> 05:31.660
front of the... You're talking about the Wellburn 
Road? North Gate. All right. Okay. Going towards

05:34.984 --> 05:36.566
21. Okay. And that's where the line was there. Of 
course, there was a line on... going to Houston or

05:40.906 --> 05:47.922
going to Dallas,

05:40.906 --> 05:47.922
but I didn't have to hitchhike a whole lot. We 
normally, there were a few people from the radio

05:47.982 --> 05:57.885
that had cars, and then of course once dusk got 
there, the only time I went home was either

05:47.982 --> 05:57.885
Thanksgiving or Easter or something like that. 
Did you ever have any bad experiences

05:58.152 --> 06:01.435
hitchhiking? Well, I finished high school. I 
hitchhiked to Chicago and worked that summer. I

06:11.925 --> 06:13.726
worked two jobs. You and I would be petrified if one 
of our children or grandchildren wanted to do

06:13.746 --> 06:17.910
that. I turned 18 on the 17th of June, and on the 18th 
I hitchhiked to Chicago. That's where I got the

06:23.455 --> 06:26.758
money to go the first semester without work. He's 
Dr. Alabama. Sylvia was a student there. She was a

06:32.808 --> 06:39.814
student there my junior and senior, no, sophomore 
freshman. See,

06:39.994 --> 06:49.883
she finished high school a year after I did and 
finished college a year before I did. Great. Now,

06:50.083 --> 06:51.064
she's from Laredo? Yes. Right. How did you all 
maintain contact? Letter writing. Letter

06:56.329 --> 06:56.850
writing. Every day. Every day. Both directions? 
Yeah. Do you remember, did she come to A&M for any

07:01.754 --> 07:06.759
important events? Yes, she did. A football game 
when I was a freshman. She enjoyed the TCU tornado,

07:09.642 --> 07:16.130
or hurricane, whatever it was that went through 
there. And she had new clothes on and new shoes, and

07:16.830 --> 07:21.035
we just totally danced. That was as a freshman. She 
came for my junior year, came to combat ball. From

07:28.855 --> 07:30.657
Alabama. How did she get there? By train. From 
Loretta, though, when she was a high school

07:34.282 --> 07:44.114
senior, friends that were going up there, friends 
of her family. Her mother wouldn't let her go. She

07:45.436 --> 07:47.278
came from Alabama by train. Where did you meet the 
train? Good question. Was it up in Iola, or was it

07:51.703 --> 07:58.592
there on the West Gate at the college station?

08:02.116 --> 08:06.403
Well, it must not have been a terribly difficult 
time. It must have been easy for her. Where did she

08:07.605 --> 08:08.447
stay?

08:12.934 --> 08:17.402
She stayed with Tommy and Carolyn Lumpen when she 
came as a junior. And when she came out of the

08:18.684 --> 08:21.769
freshman, she only came twice. When she came out of 
freshman, she had a cousin that lived there. It

08:28.306 --> 08:30.129
was, again, in the apartments. Now, you all 
didn't, by chance, get engaged or anything on an

08:30.289 --> 08:35.537
A&M weekend? No. OK. See, I was going to ask you to 
describe what you could if that had happened.

08:43.709 --> 08:47.935
Let's see, did you take her to any boot dance or? I 
took her to the combat ball when I was a freshman. I

08:50.980 --> 08:52.522
mean, excuse me, a junior. Describe that weekend, 
please.

08:57.348 --> 09:04.937
Because a lot of activities and it was a show off 
your girlfriends kind of a thing. And by that time,

09:04.957 --> 09:15.128
a lot of our classmates had their girlfriends 
there. And that's when we first started making

09:15.168 --> 09:21.235
some of the friends that we still have. Where did 
she stay? She stayed with Tommy again. And what did

09:25.886 --> 09:28.911
one wear to the combat ball? You want to see a 
picture? I've got one. No, just describe it. Well,

09:33.197 --> 09:41.910
see, the combat ball, we wore fatigues, and we got 
fatigued kind of dressed for our dates. But in the

09:41.930 --> 09:47.098
military ball, they dress up in nice, we wore 
the... or better uniforms, and then they wore the

09:47.450 --> 09:57.825
lacy, I don't know how many undercoats, 
petticoats kind of thing. Where were those dances

09:57.845 --> 09:59.267
held? Sedesa. And was there a particular band that 
played? Aggie Network. Okay. And how did people

10:05.976 --> 10:08.700
behave themselves at those? Very well. It was, 
they were fun occasions. And people got there on

10:14.548 --> 10:17.052
time, and You know, maybe left towards the end of 
it, but it was an event. Let's see. You didn't have a

10:24.267 --> 10:25.228
car. When Gus was there, I had a useful car. You had a 
useful car, but you didn't know him, right? He

10:32.257 --> 10:43.151
finished, I was, the fifth year I was there, Gus 
graduated that, when I should have, in 59, and then

10:32.257 --> 10:43.151
I finished in 60. And I'll take it back to you, but 
Gus finished in 58. And... So I didn't have a car the

10:47.035 --> 10:49.258
last two years. Let's see. The president, when you 
were there, was there? That's a guy that impressed

10:55.305 --> 10:57.528
me. Huh? Earl Rutter. OK. Describe Earl Rutter. 
OK. See, he was a charger. He was a charger. It was

11:06.659 --> 11:07.861
his first year. Because he came there. He was 
brought there. I think being groomed, as I now

11:10.264 --> 11:16.992
understand, being groomed for president.

11:17.613 --> 11:25.643
My roommate, John Thomas, and his daddy and Earl 
Rudder were at Tarleton together. And of course,

11:25.904 --> 11:29.628
we were the General Moore outfit our senior year. 
We had the Corps. And so we got to see him a lot.

11:33.373 --> 11:37.078
Because any visitors that came, he would bring 
them over to our house. And he would go through our

11:37.098 --> 11:41.083
place. And

11:41.303 --> 11:45.949
he was just a dynamic. I didn't know him, I saw him a 
lot, but we didn't have the relationship, maybe

11:46.250 --> 12:02.114
some did, I did not, with the President, like 
students do today. They probably were, I just

12:02.154 --> 12:05.359
wasn't one of them. Did you all think that he was in 
charge? You didn't have to think that, he let you

12:08.083 --> 12:09.665
know. But I wish, talking about And I had the 
beautiful good luck of being, working in the A&M

12:14.667 --> 12:29.687
clubs after I came back from the service and got to 
be around him a little bit in that capacity. But

12:29.707 --> 12:35.976
I'll never forget, we had our 10-year reunion in 
69, right before he died. He came to our reunion.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.081
And he and his brother. And he went up to the podium 
to speak. He takes off his jacket, his coat, he

12:44.705 --> 12:50.935
takes off his tie, and he rolls his sleeves up. And I 
wish I had a recording of that of what he, the talk

12:50.955 --> 12:59.988
that he was capable of inspiring people. He was, he 
was certainly, you know, a motivation to us. Let's

13:06.018 --> 13:08.181
see, other... campus individuals. Lupo? Did you 
ever deal with Lupo? We went in the store.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.516
Everybody knew Lupo, and Lupo knew you whether he 
did or not. I didn't spend that much money in the

13:18.598 --> 13:20.200
store. I did buy books and stuff there. I knew him, 
but I never... You didn't borrow money from him?

13:24.204 --> 13:24.564
No. Because a lot of students did. What about 
Pinky? We saw Pinky. Pinky was up, you know, later.

13:30.030 --> 13:32.133
He was already later in years. What was his 
function? I don't think he had an official

13:37.658 --> 13:41.644
function other than being the campus greeter. He 
was just there. Pinky was there. I don't believe he

13:44.388 --> 13:49.556
had an official function. Describe the 
community, the neighborhood around A&M. What was

13:55.024 --> 13:56.106
at the North Gate? Lupo's, and there was a pool hall 
up there on top of the corner drug store. We didn't

14:02.996 --> 14:05.640
have time to play pool either. of course they had a 
theater over there. Did y'all go often? A little

14:10.174 --> 14:16.461
bit, not that often, not

14:10.174 --> 14:16.461
that often. Of course the boot shop was there, and 
there were a couple of other... Where'd you buy

14:16.481 --> 14:22.268
your boots? I bought them from a Greek friend of 
Paul Boinus', who lived in Houston, and those

14:23.269 --> 14:34.142
boots in 58, 59 were probably already 25, 30 years 
old. Did you sell them? Do you remember what you

14:39.108 --> 14:40.289
paid for them? Probably around $50. And you didn't 
pass them on? No, I kept them upstairs. Because

14:48.039 --> 14:53.607
there are some people that have done both, haven't 
they? Some keep them and some pass them on? Pass

14:55.669 --> 14:56.230
them on. They were an older boot. They were 
probably a little uncomfortable. I have a narrow

15:01.537 --> 15:02.438
foot. They did fit. But at that time, for some 
reason, we were dumb, it was, it was, you were

15:04.295 --> 15:12.566
considered too core happy to wear your boots too 
much. Where was Uncle Ed's?

15:17.833 --> 15:21.258
Uncle Ed's was out on the... Welborn Road? By the 
railroad? I thought it was out the other

15:24.382 --> 15:26.044
direction. I don't know. Towards Whiskey Bridge. 
Okay. Isn't that where it was? I don't know. It was

15:31.897 --> 15:33.419
on this side of the river. It was in Brazos County.

15:38.287 --> 15:41.552
I know we used to drive over to the other side of the 
river to buy anything. That was to buy whiskey.

15:43.836 --> 15:46.640
Uncle Ed used to beer. That's what I thought. Did 
you know of any place in Brazos County where

15:50.947 --> 15:54.973
anybody could have bought whiskey? Was there any 
bootlegger? No. I've not heard of one. Were you all

16:00.557 --> 16:06.985
aware of any house of ill repute in Brazos County?

16:07.005 --> 16:08.006
I've not heard of one. No. All right. During your 
day, what were the people drank what? What

16:17.758 --> 16:18.359
alcohol? Beer and whiskey? Beer, maybe. I guess if 
anybody was able to get a hold of whiskey, you'd see

16:21.543 --> 16:25.568
some of that. Do you remember any stunts or 
anything of anybody having beer or whiskey in

16:25.750 --> 16:34.359
their rooms?

16:40.185 --> 16:40.385
No. Beer didn't last long when we got it, but I don't 
remember in our rooms. So you don't remember

16:49.134 --> 16:52.397
anybody smuggling anybody back to the door? Beer 
or body. No, no. Beer or whiskey. No. I imagine

16:58.645 --> 17:00.648
there was some. Maybe the seniors who were of age. 
We didn't. I'm not trying to sound pure. No, no. I

17:09.221 --> 17:10.042
hear you. Let's see. Do you remember any special 
off-campus national or international events

17:11.705 --> 17:21.780
that kind of caught your attention? No. See, there 
wasn't a Kennedy No, Kennedy assassination is

17:24.155 --> 17:28.521
later. The Korean War is over. Eisenhower came 
before that. I remember in 1959

17:34.289 --> 17:52.373
we had Aggie Muster on the grass in front of the MSE 
and

17:34.289 --> 17:52.373
Congressman Teague was a speaker. And he talked 
about the space program. He talked about the

17:59.255 --> 18:07.484
importance of technology, where we were going as a 
country. And it was all Star Wars to us at the time.

18:13.410 --> 18:15.953
But he said what was going to happen. And it did 
happen. And he helped make a lot of it happen. All

18:21.108 --> 18:23.391
right, let's go back to Muster. Where was it held? 
As far as you recall, was it always held at the

18:25.073 --> 18:29.798
system building?

18:32.662 --> 18:38.088
The other three years, up to my senior year, if I 
recall, it was in front of the system building. As a

18:38.108 --> 18:41.492
senior, we held it in front of the NSC. Oh, in front 
of the NSC. And generally, the people who attended

18:43.214 --> 18:47.659
Muster were? Students. Students. At that time, 
yeah. Not many off-campus. As you heard the roll

18:51.449 --> 18:58.761
call, did that do anything to your sensitivities, 
your emotions? Those were the students that had

18:58.801 --> 19:03.228
passed away during that year. The same honored as 
Silver Taps. And Silver Taps was always a very

19:06.674 --> 19:14.266
emotional ceremony. Why emotional? Well, I guess 
We gave a lot of importance because I guess it was

19:18.348 --> 19:24.133
important that we lost a classmate or an Aggie. 
There weren't as many deaths, probably, as there

19:25.774 --> 19:27.996
are now. They're just sheer numbers. But it was 
such a solid thing. The campus was more organized

19:34.241 --> 19:40.287
and controlled, whatever you want to call it. And 
when the lights went out on the campus, they went

19:40.307 --> 19:45.431
out. I mean, the campus was in total darkness. So we 
all didn't Y'all didn't play any pranks? No, no,

19:49.815 --> 19:51.297
absolutely not. Absolutely not. It was serious. 
Nobody spoke, nobody talked. So I went back to your

19:53.900 --> 19:54.841
room. If you did have to study, you covered, you put 
blankets up, and it remained dark. But it was very,

20:01.029 --> 20:03.372
very solid.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.300
We'll look on the other side of the page now. In 
terms of student excesses, people smoked what?

20:14.727 --> 20:15.608
Cigarettes. It was a junior privilege to smoke a 
pipe, so we tried that. Didn't like it either. Did

20:22.704 --> 20:25.447
you all know about any other substances? Never saw 
anything else smoked. Did you even know the term,

20:28.491 --> 20:29.932
the words? You know, I grew up in Laredo, and I never 
saw one there. I mean, you heard about it, you knew

20:34.417 --> 20:38.021
about it, but in that time marijuana was a... You 
heard of what? Marijuana. Okay, did you even know

20:38.862 --> 20:40.664
the word cocaine? No. I would have been surprised 
if you had said yes. Anything else? Speed or

20:45.711 --> 20:46.672
anything else? No, no. It was a simpler era than 
today. Let's see. Final

20:54.981 --> 21:02.088
review your junior and senior year. Okay. We got 
screwed out of our last, when the seniors, it

21:03.669 --> 21:10.777
rained, it rained so hard we didn't have final 
review when we were seniors. Well, as juniors,

21:14.313 --> 21:16.054
That was in, that was May of 58. That

21:16.075 --> 21:35.091
was really special because,

21:16.075 --> 21:35.091
you see, Gus graduated that weekend.

21:35.111 --> 21:37.773
Sylvia came up. Albert and Mary, my brother 
Albert, he was, he was married. Mary came up. I'm

21:44.840 --> 21:49.486
trying to think if Gus was already dating his 
wife-to-be. I think my mother came up to that too.

21:55.714 --> 21:56.715
No, I don't think she did. She came up to my 
graduation. How serious were you and Sylvia then?

22:00.460 --> 22:04.745
We'd been going together since I was a senior in 
high school and she was a junior in high school. So

22:05.586 --> 22:09.371
we'd been going together for a long time. So it's 
pretty special. I

22:14.236 --> 22:22.284
didn't know that one was ever made out. And it was 
held on the drill field where they are today. Right

22:26.528 --> 22:29.290
now, let's do commencement. Where were, describe 
commencement and your feelings about it.

22:33.875 --> 22:34.455
Exciting. You know, I guess I was, it was more than 
just commencement. It was, even though See, I

22:42.569 --> 22:51.181
graduated in May of 60, and

22:42.569 --> 22:51.181
well, a lot of my class was still there, okay? In 
fact, Wesley and Mike, and you see, Williams

22:51.201 --> 22:57.870
finished in four and a half years, but Wesley, 
Mike, and I, we were real close. We always worked

22:58.371 --> 22:59.653
together. We all finished in May of 60, and so we 
donned our uniforms, and of course, we had

22:59.953 --> 23:10.888
commissioning that afternoon, but... they're 
still the emotional, beautiful exercise that

23:13.062 --> 23:20.033
still goes on today. Was either a speaker, either 
commissioning, or commencement, was there

23:20.453 --> 23:27.063
anybody that was unusual? You know, I'm not proud 
of myself for not remembering, because I've been

23:27.924 --> 23:38.260
to, as you well know, a zillion graduations. 
school district here in San Antonio where I served

23:38.611 --> 23:44.599
and then the A&M system. But you would have 
remembered if it had been a governor or a

23:44.979 --> 23:48.764
president, so you're telling me. I don't know. I 
was so excited and so, you know,

23:49.284 --> 24:00.839
it may have been a person of great importance and I 
don't remember. I should ask when I'm off and when

24:01.900 --> 24:06.306
I'm talking at okay

24:06.910 --> 24:29.323
just a few more minutes and we're down to serious

24:06.910 --> 24:29.323
what are the factors events or whatever that 
contributes to Aggie spirit

24:36.205 --> 24:36.786
What makes that? Everything around the Aggie 
spirit, with me, revolved around the Corps of

24:36.806 --> 24:42.554
Cadets, because that's where we learned it. 
That's where we felt it. I think one of the most

24:47.020 --> 24:57.514
important happenings as a freshman,

24:47.020 --> 24:57.514
and I have a theory about that, is that first march 
in. You can keep a freshman to that first march in,

24:58.355 --> 25:04.423
and you feel your heart pounding. going around 
that track, and you feel the beat. And I've seen

25:12.072 --> 25:20.202
years when we don't have the ball game early, we 
have a lot of freshmen in the quarter loss. But that

25:21.023 --> 25:24.027
was an important event as far as feeling 
something. All right. What are the other events

25:26.691 --> 25:30.816
that help build that feeling that go to it?

25:40.246 --> 25:48.436
Whenever one works with a group, and we were a group 
as a unit, we had our special group in our class.

25:49.397 --> 26:09.460
I've never had a lot of other experiences like that 
where everybody gives something and be part of a

25:49.397 --> 26:09.460
group or a unit or an effort or something with a 
supposedly positive And, or means, even war is a,

26:10.148 --> 26:16.356
I've not been in a war. I'm not, you know, I served in 
the military, and I felt that Supreme Court there,

26:16.376 --> 26:20.902
too. It has to do with that, I think, of belonging to 
something that at the time is important. As you

26:31.076 --> 26:39.767
were getting ready to leave the campus as a 
graduate, did you have any feelings about whether

26:31.076 --> 26:39.767
or not you were prepared for the real world? Did you 
feel? I

26:41.197 --> 27:01.603
would have to say I probably

26:41.197 --> 27:01.603
didn't feel as prepared as I do today from the 
standpoint of

26:41.197 --> 27:01.603
just not feeling unprepared. I was confident I 
could speak and I could do a lot of the things that

27:05.245 --> 27:11.033
people have to know how to do to get along 
professionally. But, you know, there's always

27:11.133 --> 27:13.616
that question. And then, see, I graduated on a 
Saturday morning, a commission Saturday

27:13.636 --> 27:19.204
afternoon. I went to work Monday morning, break 
with Zachary Kimberley. And I was troubled. I

27:24.130 --> 27:25.732
didn't enjoy that year. I didn't enjoy it at all. 
And I went to work for the service. It was like

27:29.498 --> 27:30.539
playing again. And to me, work is play. If it's not 
play, I don't want to do it. And I almost stayed in

27:34.405 --> 27:35.887
the Army. I came so close to in the Army. But the 
factor there was, and I guess I learned that at A&M,

27:38.770 --> 27:46.198
saying thank you and not being afraid to talk to 
somebody. I met Mr. Zachary while I was working at

27:46.218 --> 27:48.881
the company. And when I left the company, right 
before I was scheduled to leave and report to

27:48.901 --> 27:59.113
service, I went to his office in the office of 
transit tower building. and knocked on his door

27:59.498 --> 28:04.106
and asked to see him and went and thanked him. It 
wasn't his fault I didn't enjoy it. And he said,

28:06.731 --> 28:13.103
well, Raul, when you come back, you come see me. And 
to me, I said I had a job. And so I came back and he sent

28:15.960 --> 28:20.747
me out to gym up more. And small construction and 
development and get dirty kind of work. And that's

28:25.855 --> 28:30.262
where I found what I was supposed to be doing. As you 
look back on it, did A&M prepare you pretty well for

28:30.282 --> 28:37.072
that? Oh, no question. Even, you know, I never 
really used engineering as much as, say, my

28:38.575 --> 28:42.060
brothers did. or as much as some of my other 
colleagues, because I, you know, past it active, I

28:42.293 --> 28:56.474
was maybe more, even though it's not an inactive 
profession, but it wasn't what I needed to be

28:42.293 --> 28:56.474
doing. But I worked with engineering all the time, 
because I worked with engineers, with

28:57.475 --> 29:07.890
architects, worked with all the same kinds of 
things that we were prepared for and doing. I

29:08.732 --> 29:11.035
certainly have the the confidence skills.

29:15.654 --> 29:26.244
I learned,

29:15.654 --> 29:26.244
you know, I learned, I listened, and I led while I 
was at A&M. And then that taught me to lead, because

29:26.864 --> 29:32.109
you come right back in as a freshman again, and you 
woke up. So that's the other education that we talk

29:32.209 --> 29:39.216
about and John told us to express so well. other 
education or learning or learning laboratory or

29:39.803 --> 29:45.410
leadership. All right now this is one question but 
I may ask it three or four different ways. What

29:51.338 --> 29:54.743
difference did it make in your life that you 
attended A&M? What did being an Aggie what what is

29:55.464 --> 30:00.670
all that what did it mean to you? Well

30:02.072 --> 30:08.781
maybe I would have been a service oriented kind of a 
person anyway. I don't know. But I think we were

30:15.595 --> 30:25.046
instilled in us the

30:15.595 --> 30:25.046
service to others. And frankly, that other 
education probably served me better over the

30:26.368 --> 30:39.763
years than the technical education that I got, 
even though we We couldn't be in one place without

30:40.081 --> 30:44.726
the other. And they both get you there. But 
unfortunately, or fortunately, whatever one

30:47.268 --> 31:02.403
wants to put it, everybody ends up with people and 
with opportunities to make something happen. And

31:02.563 --> 31:09.430
working with people, working with yourself

31:10.439 --> 31:14.969
handling that made a lot of difference in my life. 
And if I hadn't have gone to A&M, I probably

31:14.989 --> 31:19.760
wouldn't have gotten a job with A.P. Zachary 
Hemsworth. If I hadn't have gone to talk to Mr.

31:21.063 --> 31:25.292
Zachary and say thank you, I wouldn't have gotten
