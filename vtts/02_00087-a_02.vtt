WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:06.181
We'll sell them on the street, like street 
vendors, and just buy it for the size of it. And then

00:06.982 --> 00:15.694
we'd all get together, and sometimes there would 
be an outfit function that would be going on. And

00:16.315 --> 00:22.043
then you always had to, the upperclassmen always 
would have comments about your day. And then

00:23.244 --> 00:29.413
everybody would get together and go to midnight 
y'all practice and would do that. And then, at

00:29.663 --> 00:34.009
least in my case, there were always parents who 
would come in for the weekend. And usually

00:34.029 --> 00:41.419
Saturday morning you'd get up and you'd be busy 
getting your uniform together and making sure

00:34.029 --> 00:41.419
everything was spotless. And, of course, parents 
were allowed in the dorms, and so you want to make

00:41.499 --> 00:49.089
sure that your hole looked clean and neat and 
somewhat presentable. And then typically, you

00:50.010 --> 00:58.962
know, you'd get together with your date and you'd 
fall out for the march into the games. which is

00:59.465 --> 01:06.772
something every time I still go to a game, I still go 
to watch that portion of it. And then after the

01:08.173 --> 01:16.700
game, there's usually, unfortunately when I was 
there, we didn't get to throw the year old leaders

01:08.173 --> 01:16.700
in the pond very often. My fish year we did, because 
that was the year that Gene Stallings won the

01:17.381 --> 01:23.166
cotton ball. But after that it got bad. And then 
typically I have a big party That's every night.

01:29.922 --> 01:33.227
We're going to do stuff. Seems like we usually want 
the hotels. Usually your date would stay in a

01:36.872 --> 01:38.774
hotel. But back then, no one had apartments. You 
had to live on campus. In fact, I can remember my

01:44.462 --> 01:49.328
senior year.

01:52.272 --> 01:56.758
My two really close friends, we're twin brothers. 
we all became data and got an apartment. And I can

02:00.376 --> 02:21.328
remember having to get a doctor's from not 
permission, but a doctor saying because I had

02:00.376 --> 02:21.328
special dietary needs couldn't be fulfilled on 
campus that I need to live off campus, but you

02:00.376 --> 02:21.328
actually had to have something that will allow you 
to live off campus. And so this would have been in

02:21.348 --> 02:24.012
the fall of 1970. In that era, on that Saturday 
night football weekend, what time would you have

02:24.970 --> 02:31.498
gotten the young lady to her room? How late did you 
all stay out? Oh, back then, I'd say it was very

02:35.082 --> 02:39.488
proper. It was like 12, 1 o'clock. It wasn't like 
now. How were the women treated? Very respectful.

02:48.338 --> 02:49.179
Very respectful. I think that,

02:49.260 --> 02:54.606
well, mostly very respectful. unfortunately can 
remember certain

02:54.856 --> 03:23.563
core trips when we would have let's say we're 
playing at Baylor and one of our buddies would have

02:54.856 --> 03:23.563
a girlfriend at Baylor and she would try to get 
everybody dates and sometimes if your date was not

02:54.856 --> 03:23.563
what you had hoped for Aggies could be pretty cool 
and there were certain things that would be done

02:54.856 --> 03:23.563
like pots taken to See who had the worst date. Yeah. 
Let's see. Was that a moose pot? Something, yeah.

03:29.621 --> 03:29.822
All right. Are you aware that also the women used to 
sometimes from TWU have exactly the... Oh, I would

03:30.763 --> 03:38.031
think they would. You know, I never went out with 
anybody from TWU. Oh, really? Yeah. Now, in your

03:40.894 --> 03:45.960
era, were they still bringing down busloads, 
trainloads, upcassings? No. Okay. A little bit

03:46.881 --> 03:48.503
after that, or a little bit before that. As you look 
back on it, How likely was it that something would

03:51.438 --> 04:05.338
happen involving a young man and a young woman on 
weekends at A&M then that was pretty extreme

03:51.438 --> 04:05.338
compared to today? I would say it was very tame. I 
truly don't even remember, like, guys trying to

04:08.002 --> 04:13.349
sneak girls into the room. I mean, I don't just 
remember that. It just didn't happen. I mean, you

04:16.133 --> 04:20.820
may go to the hotel and stay with the girl 
overnight, but I don't recall ever... I mean,

04:21.830 --> 04:29.960
people, it was still an era when there was, I think, 
a pretty high degree of propriety, particularly

04:21.830 --> 04:29.960
between males. How often were you aware that 
somebody just got really drunk? Oh, that happened

04:35.788 --> 04:38.351
quite frequently. Is that right? Not drunk to the 
extent of maybe

04:38.852 --> 04:48.404
having, you know, doing damage or anything 
physical. But, you know, drink was a pretty, Big

04:51.260 --> 04:53.382
part of going to school there. And

04:53.983 --> 05:01.471
was there somebody then who literally was careful 
not to get drunk to be the driver? No, there was no

05:01.752 --> 05:04.615
such thing as a designated driver, 
unfortunately. And on some of the court trips, I

05:04.635 --> 05:13.344
can remember driving back to College Station 
when, in retrospect, there was probably none of us

05:04.635 --> 05:13.344
should have been driving. And you talk about 
people who made a difference. That brings up

05:15.126 --> 05:16.828
another thing. I can remember at the end of my 
sophomore year, um and it was right before

05:21.922 --> 05:46.900
christmas and my roommate and i had been out we had 
some drinks been having a good time and we're

05:21.922 --> 05:46.900
weaving back on the campus and getting ready to 
park and all of a sudden we see lights behind us like

05:21.922 --> 05:46.900
we're in deep trouble now and the campus cop guy 
gets out and of course we're underage we've been

05:21.922 --> 05:46.900
drinking and we've broken all these rules And he 
took our names down, our driver's license down,

05:47.318 --> 05:52.505
and we're thinking, this is going to be horrible. 
And he said, well, boys, he said, I'm going to think

05:52.525 --> 05:56.150
about this. And he said, if you go home over the 
holidays, you may be getting something in the mail

05:56.331 --> 06:04.482
that says, here's a citation for underage 
drinking. And he says, but if you don't get

06:04.662 --> 06:09.789
anything in the mail while you're at home over 
Christmas, how do you get home? And so we sweat it. I

06:10.751 --> 06:14.396
can remember going in the mailbox every day to 
check to see if it got anything. And I think it was

06:14.456 --> 06:15.958
just his way of, The

06:16.343 --> 06:30.638
what other evils did you all know about other than 
staying out late and drink? Oh, and when you drank,

06:30.658 --> 06:32.901
what did people drink? What were the beverages 
they were drinking? Mostly just beer. We weren't

06:35.884 --> 06:37.185
real sophisticated. I can remember lots of kegs of 
beer. A lot of times our outfit would go out and

06:41.403 --> 06:49.614
somebody would go out deer hunting and they'd get a 
deer and it would go, I can't remember where it was,

06:41.403 --> 06:49.614
but it was someplace off campus. And we'd butcher 
the deer right there on the spot and barbecue it up

06:50.576 --> 06:56.624
and have kegs of beer. I remember doing that quite a 
bit. Did anybody ever butcher it in the dorm? Not in

07:03.774 --> 07:04.575
the dorm, no. Because I've heard two or three good 
stories about that. You're talking about the

07:08.235 --> 07:09.557
evils, too. I've been thinking about it in the late 
60s, early 70s. And I can say, I don't recall any

07:13.143 --> 07:17.451
drug use. What drugs did you know existed?

07:23.060 --> 07:30.833
I can say that my whole four years at A&M, I never 
went to a party, never smelled at the dorms,

07:23.060 --> 07:30.833
never... Was there, did you know of any Aggie 
having marijuana in that year? Probably back

07:36.035 --> 07:40.000
then, I wouldn't even know. And were you aware of 
the words heroin or cocaine?

07:45.989 --> 07:52.618
Probably.

07:54.303 --> 08:01.471
And were you aware of any Aggies being the 
fathering children out of wedlock very much? No, a

08:03.273 --> 08:09.239
couple of my Aggie

08:03.273 --> 08:09.239
buddies.

08:11.262 --> 08:18.049
It was a very cold night, and as I recall, those 
windows at the end of the hallways there were a

08:18.890 --> 08:40.880
group of people standing around, and it was a very, 
very cold night, and the glass was very cold, and

08:18.890 --> 08:40.880
one of the students in the dorm decided to move the 
people out there, and one of the warm, rearing,

08:18.890 --> 08:40.880
cold glass shattered.

08:40.900 --> 08:44.765
And did he get any special treatment from any? I 
think he had to go to the hospital to get it. Oh,

08:46.808 --> 08:47.669
really? Yeah. Oh, oh, oh. I was wondering if any 
upperclassmen made it. No, no. And I remember if it

08:52.098 --> 08:55.714
was one of our temporaries or if it was...

09:00.436 --> 09:07.863
When I was there, I'm sure you see this picture all 
the time, Hector Gutierrez. Hector and then Henry

09:07.883 --> 09:13.328
was two years ahead of me. Hector was Corps 
Commander.

09:18.673 --> 09:21.636
And I knew him well then and know him well now. Great 
guy. Did you ever have any personal interaction

09:23.497 --> 09:27.321
with Hector? Well, because for a couple years we 
lived in the core dorm, or the core headquarters.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.454
That's how we were seen.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.320
Describe Hector. He was what I would categorize as 
a true leader. Examples of that leadership. Henry

09:50.757 --> 10:11.968
Cisneros.

10:12.849 --> 10:16.815
I think they both had very

10:21.267 --> 10:26.872
They both had extraordinary leadership quality. 
Did for either one of them, did you and your fellow

10:26.892 --> 10:35.781
Aggies think it meant anything plus or minus that 
they were Hispanic? I don't think back then it

10:36.562 --> 10:40.625
didn't matter. I certainly don't remember 
thinking that this is great that these Hispanics

10:40.645 --> 10:44.909
have got this great role. But on the other hand, we 
didn't think why are these guys You didn't think

10:48.790 --> 10:51.813
negatively. You didn't think they... No, there's 
not a racial thing. And for me, not growing up

10:55.356 --> 11:01.723
around any Hispanics, I certainly didn't have any 
prejudice from one way or the other. But I remember

11:01.743 --> 11:03.264
them very differently. And then we had a guy named 
Matt Carroll. I think he was the Corps Commander my

11:07.789 --> 11:12.653
junior year. And then Van Taylor was Corps 
Commander my senior year from my high school. Oh,

11:16.077 --> 11:16.598
really? Oh, see, I know Van then and now. Oh, 
really? I was on the Southwestern Bell Board for 17

11:20.904 --> 11:23.809
years. Describe undergraduate Van Taylor. 
Serious all the time. I mean, not to say that he

11:29.197 --> 11:39.493
was...

11:29.197 --> 11:39.493
Well, he wasn't fun, but he was a pretty serious 
guy. And then another guy that he worked with was

11:39.513 --> 11:43.519
Commander...

11:54.097 --> 12:24.019
did

11:54.097 --> 12:24.019
you and your fellow students think that the 
student leaders were selected truly on the basis

11:54.097 --> 12:24.019
of merit the corps commanders and people like that 
i didn't really get in the political aspects of it

11:54.097 --> 12:24.019
but i know my senior i thought that the band had um 
been a good ROTC student, and I thought he deserved

12:25.501 --> 12:33.068
it. Matt Carroll almost didn't get to be Corps 
Commander because we were, and I can't remember

12:33.088 --> 12:54.006
why, I can't remember if it was because where he 
grew up, but for some reason, the summer or the

12:33.088 --> 12:54.006
spring, as we were leaving for the summer, before 
the year that he was going to be Corps Commander, so

12:33.088 --> 12:54.006
this would have been the end of my sophomore year, 
going into my junior year, and one in his senior

12:54.661 --> 13:01.667
year, for some reason, he was riding back down. I 
don't know if he was, we dropped him off along the

13:01.687 --> 13:08.033
way or what the circumstances were, but we were 
going down Highway six. And I decided I was going to

13:08.053 --> 13:15.680
pass somebody, of course, there was just a two lane 
road, and a car was coming the other direction. And

13:16.561 --> 13:19.724
we managed to swerve off the road. No. Yeah. And I 
think, as I recall, Matt's comments were

13:23.905 --> 13:33.898
something like, you know, and I'm not sure 
whatever happened.

13:33.918 --> 13:34.579
He's done well. I've forgotten what he's doing 
now, but he's done well. Among

13:37.542 --> 13:50.639
you and your fellow students, which of the 
extracurricular student groups did you all

13:37.542 --> 13:50.639
respect most? Which had the highest prestige? rvs

13:53.892 --> 14:22.870
compared to the band and msc and all that which

13:53.892 --> 14:22.870
which single student office on the campus had the 
highest prestige

13:53.892 --> 14:22.870
well back when i was it's not an office but a core 
commander okay it's clearly the most important

13:53.892 --> 14:22.870
question and that was that was more than being 
student body president I mean, like, I couldn't

14:24.284 --> 14:29.389
tell you who the student body president was each of 
the four years I was in school. I can tell you who the

14:29.409 --> 14:31.672
corps commander was. And MSC council president, 
you know, same thing. But I remember that was

14:35.696 --> 14:37.117
important. Yeah. And Sconda was important, but, 
you know, back then, I don't know what the

14:37.398 --> 14:43.764
percentage was. It was four versus Monterey, but 
it was still a big percentage. What did you and your

14:51.953 --> 14:54.055
buddies think about the band? There were BQs. I 
think that, I mean, you love the band. And again, to

15:02.445 --> 15:09.736
this day, every time I'm down for a football game, 
that's what I want to do is to go down and get that

15:02.445 --> 15:09.736
experience. But I can say that I don't know that I 
ever was close to anybody that was in the band.

15:18.228 --> 15:23.276
Physically, we were always up on that other, that 
north end of the quad, going two and four. And so for

15:26.063 --> 15:30.849
some reason just never had an opportunity to meet a 
lot of guys. There were a lot of outfits that for one

15:31.089 --> 15:34.894
reason or another you were always close to. For 
example, again, going back to my four friends that

15:34.914 --> 15:45.988
went there with the other two were in F2. So I 
probably got to know or was close to the members of

15:47.630 --> 15:53.237
F2 as I was in my own company at one. In fact, the two 
twins that where my roommates my senior year were

15:56.287 --> 16:22.969
in f2 and then the room together and to this day are 
still extremely close in fact one of them just left

15:56.287 --> 16:22.969
to go back to houston yesterday because he spent 
the weekend with me oh good um let's see uh senior

15:56.287 --> 16:22.969
boots where'd you get them and how much they cost 
Were they new? Yeah, they were new. It seems like

16:26.829 --> 16:28.811
they were about $400 or $500. What did you do with 
them when you... I still have them. You still have

16:31.113 --> 16:31.514
them? I still have them in my house. My wife keeps 
saying, what are we ever going to do with these

16:32.695 --> 16:35.798
senior boots? One day, about five years ago, I 
tried to try them on and couldn't get them on. In

16:42.385 --> 16:50.593
fact, I need to get my Aggie ring resized because 
for some reason the last three or four months I

16:42.385 --> 16:50.593
can't get my senior ring resized. Are those, what 
do those boots mean to you? Why are they special? I

16:57.080 --> 16:59.483
think it's probably just a sense of achievement. 
I've gone through three years of, I was probably

16:59.503 --> 17:04.210
not a real military guy. In fact,

17:04.230 --> 17:15.045
the summer for me, the summer between my sophomore 
and junior year when I had to sign a contract for

17:04.230 --> 17:15.045
ROTC, I wasn't sure if the Army ROTC was what I 
wanted, so I talked to the Naval OCS guys about

17:15.734 --> 17:23.785
going to the Navy. And that summer, so it would be 
the summer of 69, is when they had the first

17:23.805 --> 17:32.838
lottery. And I can remember a bunch of our buddies 
getting together and watching the lottery. Most

17:36.142 --> 17:40.067
of them had already planned on signing the 
contract. And I decided that if I got a low number,

17:40.088 --> 17:43.953
that I was going to go ahead and go with the Naval 
OCS. And if I got a high number, then I was just going

17:45.991 --> 18:13.888
to go to DNC and I got a high number and that's what I 
did so I stayed in the court the last two years which

17:45.991 --> 18:13.888
was in a sense that was our fraternities back then 
were you aware that there were some secret

17:45.991 --> 18:13.888
fraternities no not when you were there 
apparently there were one or two but probably

17:45.991 --> 18:13.888
mostly on the No, no, no. In the Corps? The TTs, the 
true Texans, and the swastikas go back to the 20s.

18:27.088 --> 18:34.416
And almost nobody has been willing to say anything 
to me other than, yes, I heard there were some, but I

18:27.088 --> 18:34.416
don't know. The swastikas use the swastika as 
their symbol, and it goes back at least to the 20s,

18:35.157 --> 18:42.886
maybe the teens. So long before Adolf Hitler. you 
about it. And apparently their total purpose was

18:45.485 --> 18:55.337
to try to help members of their group become corps 
commander, RVs, senior class president and that

18:45.485 --> 18:55.337
sort of thing. Let's see, what physical changes 
were there on the campus in your four years? What

19:03.487 --> 19:04.168
was new? What was,

19:04.248 --> 19:08.473
did it change much? Do you remember?

19:12.037 --> 19:17.842
12,000 students when we started and probably 16 or 
17,000 when I graduated. Make believe that I'd

19:17.902 --> 19:20.504
never heard of this man Earl Rutter. Tell me about 
him as you students knew him. I mean I can remember

19:23.627 --> 19:25.969
him as being larger than life.

19:31.975 --> 19:33.076
Unplug up there. Rutter's Rangers. Remember all 
the stories of Rutter's Rangers and all of his

19:35.658 --> 19:41.503
heroic deeds? We can remember, I can remember 
going by the house at Christmas time and

19:42.192 --> 19:47.938
serenading him with Christmas carols.

19:51.022 --> 19:56.548
And just a truly remarkable,

19:51.022 --> 19:56.548
remarkable memory. What word or words would you 
now describe the feeling which you and your

19:56.568 --> 20:02.014
colleagues had about him?

20:06.199 --> 20:08.942
Admired him, respected him.

20:11.453 --> 20:23.124
And now later in life, I know that he's been given a 
lot of credit for

20:11.453 --> 20:23.124
bucking the trend and allowing co-education and 
making the poor optional. And so I think now we have

20:23.144 --> 20:26.547
to say forward thinking.

20:29.810 --> 20:39.199
Probably, I can't think of too many people that 
I've ever come across in my lifetime that you would

20:29.810 --> 20:39.199
put into a hero status, but he would be one. Let's 
see. Did

20:46.364 --> 20:55.972
you ever hitchhike? Oh, yeah. Describe hit Aggie 
hitchhiking. Put on the uniform and get out. I

21:02.277 --> 21:06.341
mean, I hitchhiked, hitchhiked a lot from College 
Station orange. And of course, again, this was

21:06.361 --> 21:11.065
back during the days of the Vietnam War. And Well, 
probably we've expected to have been heckled more

21:12.440 --> 21:15.323
than we were. But I can recall very few incidents 
where, you know, people would yell stuff at you as

21:17.044 --> 21:25.712
you're out on the side of the road or whatever. I'd 
say almost all positive experiences. You caught

21:27.934 --> 21:30.196
the ride out at Eastgate. Uh-huh. And where in 
Houston was the ideal place to catch a ride, or was

21:31.777 --> 21:37.142
there a special? There wasn't a special. Usually 
you could get a ride with somebody leaving College

21:37.802 --> 21:42.126
Station and going to Houston. I mean, most direct 
route, as you know, from College Station to Orange

21:42.393 --> 21:47.500
was not through Houston. But if you were 
hitchhiking, you almost had to go that way. You

21:51.505 --> 21:58.554
usually could hitch a ride with somebody to 
Houston and then get out and start thumbing it. And

21:58.774 --> 22:03.360
usually right there on one of the major freeways 
close to Interstate 10. I don't recall ever having

22:03.721 --> 22:08.367
any problems hitching a ride. maybe one occasion 
once feeling a little bit uncomfortable, picked

22:09.713 --> 22:15.723
up a bunch of guys on Saturday night. But really, I 
mean, that was an easy way to go back and forth. In

22:23.415 --> 22:25.018
orange, where would you catch the ride? Usually 
once I got to orange, it seems like I'd have a ride to

22:26.580 --> 22:30.226
come back to College Station. Typically, it was if 
you got out of class earlier, you didn't have a ride

22:30.266 --> 22:36.035
down, but it seemed like I always had a ride back. I 
don't ever remember hitchhiking back from? Do you

22:40.538 --> 22:43.944
have any hitchhike anecdote that would be 
appropriate share? Actually, remember, it was

22:45.086 --> 22:48.131
really pretty, pretty simple. Again, and 
probably by the time I was trying to catch like more

22:48.511 --> 22:58.789
of my, my freshman, sophomore years. Never had any 
problem. Let's see, we talked about getting

23:00.203 --> 23:02.207
dates. Was Lupo around? Did you have any relations 
with Little Army Lou? No. You didn't buy it? I

23:09.961 --> 23:10.762
bought books and stuff. But you never borrowed any 
money? No, never. Because I've heard of some good

23:13.106 --> 23:18.837
stories where he would stake them and so forth. Do 
you remember any off-campus events that kind of

23:22.343 --> 23:25.667
stunned you, either in the U.S. or worldwide? This 
is the, you and I are chatting on the anniversary of

23:26.408 --> 23:31.215
the John Kennedy assassination. So for me, that 
would be one of the, do you remember any when you

23:31.715 --> 23:37.603
were a student? This would have been, I think it was 
actually the summer, probably between my

23:39.246 --> 23:50.140
sophomore and junior years, maybe my junior or 
senior year, when we landed on the moon for the

23:39.246 --> 23:50.140
first time. I remember that. Where were you, and 
what did you do? I was at a Blood, Sweat, and Tears

23:53.316 --> 23:57.860
concert in Houston. And I remember they 
interrupted the concert to say that we landed. Any

24:02.685 --> 24:03.306
feelings? I was pretty proud, yeah. I mean, it was a 
pretty special time. And, of course, you know,

24:08.491 --> 24:16.178
with us, so much of it was also

24:08.491 --> 24:16.178
things that were happening with the war. What did 
you and your friends at A&M think about Vietnam?

24:27.821 --> 24:41.177
I think there was probably

24:27.821 --> 24:41.177
not as gung-ho an attitude towards it as you would 
expect from a basic military college. I don't

24:41.197 --> 24:46.603
recall that, again, there were a lot of 
demonstrations of people necessarily radically

24:47.140 --> 25:01.037
against it, but I don't, at least in my outfit, I 
don't recall, you know, like everybody being

24:47.140 --> 25:01.037
gung-ho to say, let's hurry up and graduate so we 
can go fight the war in Vietnam. So there wasn't the

25:01.057 --> 25:08.346
resistance to it, but there certainly wasn't 
anybody that was necessarily wanting to go over

25:01.057 --> 25:08.346
there. Did some of your friends go to Vietnam and 
get killed? Not close friends, but certainly no

25:12.572 --> 25:15.375
people did. And I know people that, I had a friend 
that was able to avoid, he wasn't going to get

25:16.148 --> 25:43.658
drafted anyway, it didn't look like, but, I don't 
know exactly what, I remember he got braces put on

25:16.148 --> 25:43.658
his teeth, as a way to avoid getting drafted, 
because I guess they weren't orthodontists or

25:16.148 --> 25:43.658
something, but there was some reason that that 
was, I didn't know anybody that went to Canada,

25:16.148 --> 25:43.658
but, so I remember that. Let's see, the campus, you 
mentioned Mr. Rudder. Were there any other famous

25:48.910 --> 25:53.776
campus dignitaries of your era? Sports heroes? 
Randy Mattson was still there. He was still a

25:57.240 --> 26:03.187
pretty big figure because... What did you all 
think of Randy as a person? I think everybody

26:03.327 --> 26:04.809
looked up to him. He was a guy that had a world 
record, I guess. And, no, he was always going to go

26:08.633 --> 26:12.598
out there.

26:15.616 --> 26:39.497
remember

26:15.616 --> 26:39.497
Malin's nickname as attack officer

26:15.616 --> 26:39.497
the slink and one of his buddies was the wage, the 
simplest tool known to man. That was the Corps

26:45.515 --> 26:47.637
explanation. And who was that? No, I don't. Who was 
the commandant of the Corps when you were there?

26:53.845 --> 26:55.107
You see, I don't remember my secret. Oh, the 
commandant,

26:55.127 --> 27:00.774
I don't know. I don't even remember. I don't 
remember who the band... I'm a band director.

27:06.541 --> 27:09.585
Colonel, was it... Adam

27:10.831 --> 27:39.285
final review your junior and senior year describe 
feelings where did it happen and so forth

27:10.831 --> 27:39.285
you know I don't remember that's for some reason 
for me that wasn't a good living memory

27:42.607 --> 27:52.821
Actually, I dropped out of the Corps finally the 
spring semester of my senior year. So you didn't go

27:52.841 --> 27:53.863
through that. So I didn't go in my senior year. But I 
remember it was a big deal in my junior year, but I

27:56.166 --> 28:02.455
don't know why it wasn't a strong experience. What 
did it feel like putting on those senior boots the

28:02.475 --> 28:05.459
first time? That felt real special. That was a 
pretty incredible experience. That and my senior

28:09.986 --> 28:11.668
year. Do you remember what the senior ring cost

28:13.032 --> 28:19.601
you? $35. It's now almost $500. Well, I can 
remember because my first senior ring, I lost it to

28:21.504 --> 28:30.917
the Houston Lord football team, and my parents 
bought me another replacement ring. I think back

28:30.937 --> 28:36.345
then it was like $350. And that senior ring has been 
interesting because for the 10 years you saw us in

28:40.471 --> 28:44.556
New York, I didn't wear it very frequently. 
Because it's just kind of people back then. That

28:49.121 --> 28:50.223
wasn't part of the jewelry. And when we moved back 
out here, I started wearing it. And it's just been

28:55.469 --> 29:01.296
amazing how my wife likes to get a lot of Aggies. And 
how cross room.

29:06.502 --> 29:10.427
Do you have any good Aggie ring story to offer? 
Okay, good things happen. I mean, I'm going to

29:13.781 --> 29:16.844
upgrade on airplanes. Flight attendants in my

29:17.224 --> 29:22.449
first class. But mostly it's just the 
camaraderie.

29:28.835 --> 29:32.118
Things that happen as a result. Do you remember 
silver taps first time or any of any time that was

29:33.179 --> 29:38.304
special?

29:41.027 --> 29:41.427
Very In fact, there's a letter in the court museum, 
and I don't remember, I'm sure I remember at the

29:42.740 --> 30:04.841
time, I don't remember too vividly right now, but 
it's a letter by a young man that wrote his parents

29:42.740 --> 30:04.841
about his first silver taps, and then the next week 
he was killed. And the letter's in the court

30:04.861 --> 30:08.545
museum, and you can't... you can't go by and read 
it. To this day, I still read that letter and get

30:11.692 --> 30:14.236
chucked out. And that occurred when I was in 
school. Then I remember another thing that was

30:18.021 --> 30:19.743
kind of interesting. I don't even remember what 
the final outcome was, but when I was there, there

30:20.264 --> 30:34.685
was a student that was killed in the process of 
committing the robbery at the Gibson store right

30:20.264 --> 30:34.685
there. And I remember the big discussion of 
whether silver taps should be held for them. And I

30:39.828 --> 30:41.632
don't remember if it actually was. I think they did 
hold it. Do you know that? I was part of the process

30:46.622 --> 30:52.494
of where the paper flow went. Probably in 1970. I 
was among those who asked the question, was this

30:55.825 --> 31:01.511
person an Aggie or not? If this person was an Aggie, 
isn't silver taps held for all Aggies? If this

31:07.737 --> 31:10.660
person was not an Aggie, then there's no question. 
And everybody agreed, yep, he was an Aggie,

31:10.680 --> 31:17.107
therefore we'll hold it.

31:18.629 --> 31:21.732
Did all of you and all of your colleagues respect 
the protocol of when to be silent when to keep the

31:21.712 --> 31:43.264
lights out and so forth i would say that was 
probably ahead of all the traditions right one

31:21.712 --> 31:43.264
certainly one that's made the most vivid memories 
all right these traditions uh list the traditions

31:21.712 --> 31:43.264
that are
