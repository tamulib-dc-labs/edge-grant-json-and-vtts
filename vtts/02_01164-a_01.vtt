00:04.317 --> 00:12.346
Okay, this is Ron Shorn interviewing Heiss 
Spinrad at Heiss Home in Moraga, California on

00:04.317 --> 00:12.346
June 9th, 1993. Heida, just for the record, what's 
your full name? Heiren Spinrad. How do you spell

00:19.235 --> 00:20.075
that? H-Y-R-O-N-S-P-I-N-R-A-D.

00:25.782 --> 00:26.463
When were you born? Long ago. What date? February 
17th, 1934. And where were you born? New York. What

00:34.574 --> 00:35.335
part of New York? Bad part. Brooklyn? Actually, I 
think I was born in New York City, but I lived in

00:38.137 --> 00:41.741
Brooklyn after the first week. How did you get 
interested in astronomy? My grandmother was

00:45.845 --> 00:53.472
interested in a lot of intellectual things, 
family not having an extraordinarily

00:45.845 --> 00:53.472
intellectual background. I'm not sure where that 
started. But in any case, she brought several

00:55.434 --> 01:03.822
books home when I was, gosh, I don't know, between 
five and seven years of age. and I was interested in

01:04.628 --> 01:06.951
looking at the sky. When I was eight years old, 
during World War II, New York became blacked out,

01:07.552 --> 01:17.464
and therefore the sky got dark. So you could 
actually see the stars in the Milky Way, and

01:17.484 --> 01:21.469
everything that was supposed to be there was 
there. That was fairly inspiring to a young kid. So

01:26.054 --> 01:34.585
I think it was my grandmother's influence and the 
fact that you could see the sky and wonder about it

01:26.054 --> 01:34.585
that got me started, and then I got small telescope 
of relatively low quality that was adequate to see

01:35.543 --> 01:49.735
a few double stars and perhaps maybe barely the 
phases of Venus, and that helped a lot too. That was

01:49.815 --> 01:56.221
from some kind of pawn shop, I think. Did this 
interest in astronomy carry through high school?

01:59.123 --> 02:00.865
No, not vividly. In high school, I sort of got away 
from that and was more interested in in sports, and

02:05.429 --> 02:13.740
I still did okay in physics and chemistry and 
mathematics, but I didn't really have my heart in

02:05.429 --> 02:13.740
it. On the other hand, I didn't know what else to do 
when I went to start my undergraduate education at

02:14.201 --> 02:22.231
Berkeley, so I decided I would be an astronomer 
unless something better came along. How come

02:22.552 --> 02:25.976
Berkeley if you were born in New York City? Yes, 
good point. My family and I moved to California in

02:27.499 --> 02:33.867
1946 when I was 12 years old, in junior high school. 
So I did my junior high school and high school

02:36.162 --> 02:41.209
curriculum in San Francisco. Berkeley was 
nearby, in those days very inexpensive, and I

02:41.649 --> 02:54.827
could live there and not break the bank, which was 
relatively thin. So were you an astronomy major?

02:57.891 --> 03:00.274
Yeah, I was an astronomy major initially by 
default. Then after I took a class With Struve, I

03:02.669 --> 03:05.032
knew I really liked it. I don't know if he had a 
reputation of being a good teacher, but he was

03:06.535 --> 03:11.802
inspirational, whether he knew it or not. When did 
you get your bachelor's degree? Bachelor's

03:14.286 --> 03:16.229
degree was in 55. And then you went to grad school? 
No, I was in the Army for two years in between, in the

03:19.573 --> 03:31.731
Philippines, Marianas, Carolinas, and western 
U.S., measuring stellar occultations under John

03:19.573 --> 03:31.731
O'Keefe's project, which was to find the location 
of everything between the West Coast and China for

03:32.285 --> 03:36.692
unpeaceful reasons. Middle of the Cold War, of 
course.

03:43.061 --> 03:44.002
What was your thesis on? My thesis was the stellar 
content of nearby bright galaxies. I did that with

03:48.709 --> 03:51.273
Whitford and Mayall, predominantly. Did you pick 
that, or did they pick it for you? I picked it,

03:53.536 --> 04:02.089
actually, which was perhaps slightly unusual, 
and that made it a little bit hard to find the

03:53.536 --> 04:02.089
appropriate advisor, but it turned out that those 
two men Male and Woodford actually were perfect

04:02.305 --> 04:06.771
for this, and I learned a lot from them. Why did you 
pick that topic? Why were you interested in it?

04:10.255 --> 04:17.905
I've always been interested in stellar spectra, 
and the stellar content of galaxies, I thought,

04:10.255 --> 04:17.905
could be attacked in that way. And Morgan and Male 
had just come out with a paper doing a little bit of

04:17.945 --> 04:23.052
that in a very qualitative way. So it was somewhat 
of an outgrowth of the interest in stars and the

04:23.893 --> 04:31.603
timeliness of it and the availability of... 
relatively modest, or now we would say very

04:31.904 --> 04:36.070
modest, equipment on medium-sized telescopes. 
Which was like the Crosley, 36 inches. 0.9 meter,

04:38.633 --> 04:40.075
yeah, 36 inch. I used both 36 inches at Lick, 
actually, the Crosley more than the refractor.

04:45.042 --> 04:46.304
When did you get your PhD? PhD was in 61. Okay, and 
where did you go from there? Right to JPL. How come?

04:52.813 --> 04:53.774
Well, that was strange. Yeah, yeah, I know. Sagan 
had come to Berkeley in 60, I guess, as a Miller...

05:00.592 --> 05:03.418
fellow after his PhD from Chicago. And he was the 
first person around Berkeley to talk about

05:04.520 --> 05:19.292
planets in what then seemed a modern way, 
exploring them by spacecraft, exploring them in

05:04.520 --> 05:19.292
other ways, and doing more than just a few poorish 
review articles of the previous generation would

05:20.217 --> 05:25.522
suggest. Certainly Berkeley at the time was not a 
hotbed of planetary astronomy. There was some

05:30.447 --> 05:33.609
celestial mechanics, of course, going on. How did 
you pick JPL, or did they come around? I

05:37.893 --> 05:39.655
interviewed a bunch of places. I wanted to stay in 
California if possible for family reasons

05:39.675 --> 05:47.102
predominantly, and I checked out A couple places. 
There were industrial places that were looking

05:48.847 --> 05:55.381
for astronomers then, too, although those jobs 
later turned out to be kind of ephemeral. What,

05:55.501 --> 05:57.786
like North American aviation? Aeroneutronics 
from Ford.

06:02.095 --> 06:07.707
Lockheed, I think, were in general not so much the 
time I was actually looking around. A couple other

06:08.429 --> 06:11.612
places whose names I've gracefully forgotten. 
Were those places funded by the Air Force or by NASA

06:11.972 --> 06:17.498
or what? I'm not really sure. I never dug into it 
that deeply. Probably anything they could come up

06:20.260 --> 06:22.142
with. So probably all those. Anyway, JPL was 
another one on the list, and I went down there and

06:23.403 --> 06:28.488
checked out Caltech. Greenstein had a postdoc 
available, and JPL did them sort of both in the same

06:28.929 --> 06:34.874
week. And... Of course, Greenstein would have 
been interested in me working on stars with his

06:36.425 --> 06:41.471
abundance program. And, of course, JPL would have 
been, at that time, happy to get an astronomer. Who

06:47.639 --> 06:50.082
got the Greenstein thing? I don't remember. 
Probably Sargent. Or Bob O'Dell or something.

06:54.628 --> 06:57.531
O'Dell did get something down there, but I think 
that was at Carnegie, actually. It was about the

06:57.732 --> 06:59.534
same time, within a few months. The O'Dells and... 
Our family actually were in the same apartment

07:03.188 --> 07:09.875
complex, and the two wives met by accident over a 
clothesline. It's a funny story in itself. Okay,

07:12.137 --> 07:15.041
you arrived at JPL. Were you their first PhD 
astronomer? Yeah, I think so. Of course, Ray

07:19.285 --> 07:21.527
Newbern had been there for some time before. Who 
was your boss? Was Luke Kaplan the boss? Not yet.

07:26.272 --> 07:32.419
No, there was another guy who really didn't have a 
technical background, who was the de facto

07:26.272 --> 07:32.419
section boss, but in practice... Ray was just 
about that without the stature or pay. And when you

07:39.136 --> 07:44.946
got there and looked around, what did you think of 
the place? I mean, there weren't any big

07:45.026 --> 07:46.669
telescopes or anything. No, there weren't any big 
telescopes, which created a problem that we'll

07:46.689 --> 07:50.095
talk about shortly. That was, of course, a very 
severe problem. But initially, I wasn't panicked

07:52.239 --> 07:54.083
about that. The main job I was assigned to do at 
first supposedly half time, but I had no idea what

07:58.032 --> 08:15.955
fraction of time would be, was to coordinate an 
instrument designed by Dr. Charles Barth, who

07:58.032 --> 08:15.955
then was at JPL, a UV spectrometer, I think, to get 
ultraviolet spectra of planets from spacecraft.

08:17.577 --> 08:21.021
I'm not positive if the first one was a Mariner 
Venus. Probably was, but I'm not positive of that

08:21.682 --> 08:23.905
any longer. In any case, so I was supposed to 
coordinate Barth and his engineers and the rest of

08:24.307 --> 08:50.112
the project, which seemed like a strange role for a 
fresh PhD who didn't know ultraviolet from the

08:24.307 --> 08:50.112
bomber limit and certainly had no previous 
experience dealing with interesting and

08:24.307 --> 08:50.112
creative and, to be brutally frank about it, quite 
egotistical personalities. But you learn when

08:50.817 --> 08:52.259
you do these things. And actually, that turned out 
to be mildly interesting and took much less of my

08:52.299 --> 08:58.305
time than I thought it would. So I did actually have 
time to initiate research if I wanted to. And I did a

09:02.610 --> 09:08.376
little bit of continued work on galaxies, but I 
figured I wasn't being paid by JPL to do that. So I

09:08.396 --> 09:20.790
figured I would look into the possibilities in 
planetary astronomy in areas that I had a little

09:08.396 --> 09:20.790
bit of previous knowledge, that is spectroscopy 
of the planets, and was annoyed to find that there

09:21.310 --> 09:23.332
wasn't any modern data. There certainly was no 
prospect of more coming in, at least nothing that I

09:24.073 --> 09:29.199
would have any involvement in. And therefore, I 
turned to the old historical data, which

09:29.859 --> 09:40.752
astronomers generally keep forever, especially 
in the days where photography was the prime method

09:29.859 --> 09:40.752
of recording information. It's actually easier 
to document photographic plate files than it is to

09:45.273 --> 09:51.342
get people's CCD images in 1993, but that's 
getting far afield. So in any case, I sort of fell

09:51.623 --> 10:01.217
upon the Mount Wilson plate files, and that turned 
out to be an interesting intro to planetary

09:51.623 --> 10:01.217
astronomy. These were mainly photographic 
spectra taken by Dunham and associates in the late

10:01.258 --> 10:08.749
30s, and through World War II at a relatively low 
pace. At which telescope? Ah, sorry. Mostly at the

10:14.113 --> 10:15.915
100-inch telescope. This is pre-200-inch, and 
the 200-inch spectrograph wasn't particularly

10:15.935 --> 10:20.340
better than the 100-inch anyway. So it was 
100-inch Coudet spectra, by and large, although

10:20.881 --> 10:27.168
there were other types of spectra. But those were 
the ones that had the most recorded information

10:27.188 --> 10:34.737
and seemed to be amenable to some kind of new 
quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis.

10:41.075 --> 10:44.899
And they were done when the seeing was too poor to do 
stellar astronomy? I'm not sure if it was

10:44.960 --> 10:47.483
completely that. I mean, Dunham actually was a 
staff member, so it wasn't, I don't believe, I

10:47.503 --> 10:59.117
don't know the politics back that far precisely, 
but my guess is that he probably didn't have to beg

10:47.503 --> 10:59.117
as hard as an outsider would. But they were 
definitely not done during prime hours. Some of

11:03.901 --> 11:05.166
them were done in the daytime. I think a lot of them 
were done after the sun was down, or else there

11:05.206 --> 11:09.804
would have been more scattered light on them. What 
did you get out of them? Well, I got some things

11:11.234 --> 11:16.742
which later turned out not to be quite correct, but 
nevertheless, at the time, they seemed

11:11.234 --> 11:16.742
interesting. I was trying to measure the physical 
parameters of the atmosphere of Venus from a study

11:16.782 --> 11:33.867
of the carbon dioxide bands in the near-infrared, 
which at high dispersion can give you information

11:16.782 --> 11:33.867
on the rotational temperature of the CO2 gas, 
which ought to be in a high-density atmosphere

11:16.782 --> 11:33.867
equal to the kinetic temperature of the 
atmosphere, whatever optical depth is

11:34.488 --> 11:37.311
appropriate. That's a little tricky in a cloudy 
atmosphere, but neglecting that complication,

11:37.431 --> 11:52.226
it sounded like a good idea to look at whether Venus 
was hot or cold a little bit deeper in the

11:37.431 --> 11:52.226
atmosphere than infrared or such measures could 
at the time do easily. And secondarily, if you

11:52.666 --> 12:01.875
measure the line widths carefully and if there are 
no other broadening mechanisms, you can get some

11:52.666 --> 12:01.875
idea of the pressure also at the mean optical 
depth. Now the last part I think was done with some

12:04.407 --> 12:07.411
naivete, as you'll look back on it 30 years. But of 
course, when you started, it was better than

12:07.431 --> 12:12.097
anything else in the field. Definitely. Yes. I 
asked Bill Sinton about the Sinton band, so I've

12:15.461 --> 12:21.048
got to ask High Spinrad about the effect Spinrad. 
Oh, the Jovian line tilt. Yes. I still haven't

12:23.090 --> 12:24.912
quite figured that one out. Let me give a little 
preface on that. Why does one have to get your name

12:28.197 --> 12:32.642
attached to all things both good and bad? In any 
case, the ammonia and methane lines in the

12:33.398 --> 12:51.183
spectrum of Jupiter when the spectrograph slit is 
placed along the equator to get the rotational

12:33.398 --> 12:51.183
velocity turn out to be tilted approximately half 
as much as the reflected lines from the solar

12:33.398 --> 12:51.183
spectrum. The factor of two comes in basically 
just a moving mirror and our aspect on Earth in the

12:51.223 --> 12:58.073
simplest of geometries when the Sun, Earth, and 
the outer planet, like Jupiter, are lined up, give

12:58.525 --> 13:07.715
you just precisely a factor of two, because one of 
the components is Sun, Jupiter, and the other,

12:58.525 --> 13:07.715
Jupiter, Earth. And in the case of the methane and 
ammonia bands, which are physically from the

13:08.235 --> 13:13.321
Jovian atmosphere, you only get one of those. So 
that tilt should be a factor of two less. And on some

13:15.964 --> 13:18.547
spectra that Munch had obtained, and perhaps... 
This is Guido Munch. Guido Munch, yes, professor

13:19.387 --> 13:23.672
of astronomy at Caltech at the time. It looked like 
the tilts were rather less than that, as if the

13:24.732 --> 13:33.012
ammonia wasn't co-rotating with the atmospheric 
velocity. Trouble is, the tilt was so different

13:33.052 --> 13:39.467
from a half that the velocity difference you 
predict turns out to probably be supersonic,

13:33.052 --> 13:39.467
which was a bit weird, but as an empiricist, I was 
quite willing to accept the observations. I'm not

13:46.053 --> 14:06.223
quite sure what's happened, but every time 
anybody else, including me, in future years tried

13:46.053 --> 14:06.223
to reproduce the observations, which again were 
fairly old at the time, the strange deviation from

13:46.053 --> 14:06.223
half the expected tilt did not reproduce. So I've 
always assumed that there was some peculiarity in

14:08.050 --> 14:15.147
the way I measured the plates, but it doesn't 
really make complete sense. So I'm not 100% sure

14:15.167 --> 14:18.775
now what went wrong, but I'm pretty sure something 
did. I don't believe it's a physical effect. It

14:21.702 --> 14:25.772
drew a lot of attention, again, to planetary 
astronomy, but not necessarily for the best of

14:21.702 --> 14:25.772
reasons. Did you try and get Telescope Time to do 
New Spectrum? Yeah, sure. And that was a long and

14:30.299 --> 14:36.511
cluttered story, which basically was mostly 
unsuccessful. Well, it was obvious that one could

14:36.891 --> 14:43.423
do better by doing things yourself when you knew 
what the problem was going to be, or in many cases,

14:43.403 --> 14:44.906
with improved instrumentation. I mean, this is 
still the era of photography, but, for example, in

14:45.527 --> 14:53.661
near-infrared spectroscopy, fore-end plates 
had replaced one-ends, and those have much higher

14:45.527 --> 14:53.661
acuity. And generally, just the idea of doing 
something yourself when you know what was

14:54.422 --> 15:01.615
happening at the telescope is better than going 
down to some archaic file and not knowing all

15:02.000 --> 15:05.345
circumstances except what's written on the 
envelope of the plate. So at first, I made casual

15:06.587 --> 15:20.667
approaches to various observers and observatory 
directors at Mount Wilson, at McDonald, back at

15:06.587 --> 15:20.667
Lick, old stomping grounds. And these were not 
greeted generally with much enthusiasm for

15:21.102 --> 15:26.828
perhaps several reasons. I'm not positive which 
ones were the most important. Planetary

15:30.711 --> 15:35.836
astronomy still was not considered part of 
mainstream astronomy. And I think this was

15:35.856 --> 15:45.986
probably the largest factor in the sense that 
directors and other people that ran

15:35.856 --> 15:45.986
observatories were worried perhaps about 
wasting valuable observing time. In other words,

15:46.921 --> 15:49.064
real astronomers look down on planets. Yeah, for 
better or for worse, that was the case at the very

15:49.084 --> 15:53.329
beginning of the space age. I mean, obviously it 
evolved, but initially that was true. Were you

15:56.854 --> 16:00.178
ever told you made your choice between money and 
telescope time? Not in writing. But orally? Yeah.

16:03.422 --> 16:04.123
Yeah, okay. And we're slightly more diplomatic 
than that. Yeah, I won't, in fact, mention the

16:07.788 --> 16:14.457
person that said it the most bluntly, because it's 
a guy you don't even know. Okay. But, yeah, I was

16:16.030 --> 16:18.954
told that, and it was painful. JPL, of course, for 
those uninitiated, paid a lot more than a

16:19.535 --> 16:36.417
low-level academic job, starting salaries at JPL 
were twice that of a postdoc and probably, I'm just

16:19.535 --> 16:36.417
guessing, 40% or 50% higher than an assistant 
professor would have been at the same time. So for a

16:36.637 --> 16:39.441
fresh Ph.D., it was a lot of money. Now, 
technically, JPL was a part of Caltech. Yes. But

16:45.297 --> 16:47.159
practically, it was not. Is that correct? Yes. 
There was a vast chasm that separated the

16:48.340 --> 16:58.592
stature, so to speak, of JPL scientists with 
Caltech science. In some cases, that was at least

16:58.612 --> 17:01.415
true in some areas. That wasn't true in every 
endeavor. I think the people that did radio and

17:04.138 --> 17:13.129
radar astronomy were considered colleagues of 
equal footing, perhaps. But in any case, Yes,

17:15.008 --> 17:27.849
Caltech was not a cooperative partner in any sense 
of the word, with one major exception, and that was

17:15.008 --> 17:27.849
the influence of Guido Munch, professor of 
astronomy at Caltech. Guido, for his own personal

17:27.869 --> 17:37.164
interests, was interested in a variety of topics, 
very, very broad person, and one of those was

17:27.869 --> 17:37.164
planetary astronomy. So, on his own, he was doing a 
fair amount of observing of planets, but even more

17:39.646 --> 17:46.493
importantly, from my own personal viewpoint, he 
was around as a pseudo-mentor. I mean, he's the

17:46.513 --> 17:50.937
last person on Earth that would probably like to be 
accused of being a good teacher. But in any case,

17:51.778 --> 17:56.342
like it or not, he was in his own strange way. You 
were reduced to looking for water vapor on planets

17:58.644 --> 18:03.949
at Victoria, British Columbia, were you not? 
Excellent choice, wouldn't you think? All right,

18:06.781 --> 18:08.363
so that's a long story. Any case, let me make it 
quite abbreviated. Water on Mars is a long, long

18:11.085 --> 18:18.493
story, which, in fact, you have documented well.

18:21.396 --> 18:28.923
My own interest in that came, again, just from 
reading the review papers by Richardson, Dunham,

18:21.396 --> 18:28.923
and other folks. And then the first attempts to try 
to observe water from balloon altitudes by, I

18:29.584 --> 18:36.771
think, Dollfuss, actually, was the first, 
perhaps, to be successful. And people had thought

18:37.105 --> 18:39.147
about this before. And there have been attempts at 
Lowell Observatory also. The trick, of course, is

18:42.671 --> 18:50.360
to have a dry site on Earth and or a Doppler shift to 
move out the telluric lines from the Martian ones.

18:50.400 --> 19:01.392
The Mars lines, obviously, were going to be very 
weak since we know there's not very much water on

18:50.400 --> 19:01.392
Mars if you spread out the polar caps, assuming 
that they're half water or something like that.

19:01.412 --> 19:05.577
You don't get a lot of water in the atmosphere at the 
temperatures relevant to Mars. So I tried to get

19:06.839 --> 19:12.869
time at Mount Wilson, and that would have required 
using the 100-inch. The snow telescope, which I

19:13.650 --> 19:21.664
did use for Venus, was inadequate even for Venus, 
unfortunately. It was OK for getting a spectrum of

19:21.884 --> 19:23.687
the sun, however. I learned a little bit by using 
it. But that was as much as the observatory

19:25.931 --> 19:32.442
committee and Director Bowen was willing to give 
to me. I asked other places at Lick. I got a polite

19:36.847 --> 20:01.585
reply from Director Albert Whitford, who 
remarked that they had just gotten their big

19:36.847 --> 20:01.585
telescope, the three-meter, what's called the 
Shane, but now the Shane, a three-meter

19:36.847 --> 20:01.585
telescope, had just gone on the air there, and they 
had been second-rate citizens to the Mount Wilson

19:36.847 --> 20:01.585
Palomar folks for so long that they weren't 
anxious to give time away to, quotes Caltech,

20:02.223 --> 20:05.908
quote, unquote, and Whitford remarked that I 
should, you know, try here. And meaning at

20:06.689 --> 20:07.651
Caltech. Yeah, yeah, right, which, you know, is a 
logical thing to say. He wasn't trying to be

20:09.894 --> 20:11.717
particularly mean about it. I was very defensive. 
Well, nevertheless, nothing came of that. So I

20:16.223 --> 20:22.172
tried also, I think, that early at McDonald's, but 
I'm not positive it was really at that time. Was

20:22.192 --> 20:23.935
this before Harlan took over? Oh, yes. When Kuiper 
was still director. I think, actually, I had to do

20:26.859 --> 20:29.082
it through the University of Chicago. Maybe I 
didn't, but I did. In any case, it was definitely

20:30.893 --> 20:32.736
before Harlan Smith. Well, let's continue on that 
now. So I ended up then finding out, I don't

20:35.401 --> 20:46.381
remember who told me, that they had a new 40-inch 
telescope, 48-inch telescope at Victoria,

20:35.401 --> 20:46.381
British Columbia, which is, of course, an insane 
place to go looking for water. You find it very

20:47.142 --> 20:48.525
locally. Yes, you can hardly avoid it. But even on a 
clear night, it's not particularly dry. It's

20:52.612 --> 20:53.433
about as wet a side as you can. And it's far north, 
too. It's far north. The elevation is about 100

20:55.784 --> 20:57.346
meters. It's a real wet place. On the other hand, 
they've got a good telescope and a nice modern

20:59.450 --> 21:03.576
spectrograph that had been built by Harvey 
Richardson. So I got some time there with no more

21:04.277 --> 21:12.369
difficulty than suggesting a collaboration with 
Richardson, who had a mild interest in planetary

21:04.277 --> 21:12.369
work. And I don't know why they gave me time, but 
they did. I think it was, you know, something like a

21:19.088 --> 21:27.444
couple weeks a year, which was a heck of a lot for 
their second most powerful telescope and

21:19.088 --> 21:27.444
certainly their modern telescope. So we got some 
observations despite the usual difficulties

21:28.546 --> 21:32.974
with weather up there. Not good enough to find 
water on Mars or Venus, but we got some good enough

21:33.495 --> 21:42.632
spectra to be interesting and to whet everybody's 
appetite and to show that modern spectra, after we

21:33.495 --> 21:42.632
learned how to, you know, walk and climb a bit 
ourselves, we're clearly going to be superior to

21:42.950 --> 21:50.961
the material from the 30s and 40s. No surprise. 
Now, probably next comes the Kaplan, Munch, and

21:52.202 --> 21:59.993
Spinrad work, or Kaplan's team, as it was called, 
which was your idea, but will you explain how that

21:52.202 --> 21:59.993
got going? Sure. Now we're going to

22:00.754 --> 22:09.025
late, yeah, the observation was made on April 12, 
1963. I remember it very distinctly, of course.

22:14.405 --> 22:16.768
for a variety of egotistical reasons. In fact, I 
told my current students in 1993 that there was an

22:17.929 --> 22:24.176
anniversary that had something to do with Mars. 
And I was waiting for them to guess it. No one did. It

22:27.620 --> 22:29.622
was very humbling. So yesterday's prize is long 
forgotten. What have you done for us lately? Yes.

22:35.368 --> 22:38.331
Well, anyway, this got started by a continuation. 
We realized that observing from Victoria wasn't

22:38.371 --> 22:44.378
the smartest way to look for a minuscule amount of 
water on Mars. We had no idea, of course, that we

22:45.218 --> 22:48.182
could detect Martian CO2. Never entered a 
conversation. It was all argon, then, in the

22:50.886 --> 22:52.908
atmosphere of Mars. Nitrogen and argon. Or 
nitrogen and argon, yeah. No, there was the CO2

22:55.051 --> 22:59.838
detection, but it was so small, we thought, that 
you'd never see it. There was no prayer, so it never

22:59.858 --> 23:02.542
entered a conversation. So everything was 
optimized for the H2O band at 8,200 angstroms,

23:02.902 --> 23:09.811
which was stronger than the one we observed at 
Victoria. We did the 7,200 angstrom region. I

23:11.554 --> 23:12.415
don't remember why. I think the glaze of the 
grating or something like that. And then Guido

23:15.239 --> 23:24.075
insisted that we use forend plates, partly 
because he wanted to find out how fast it could be

23:15.239 --> 23:24.075
after you hyped them. Where did you stumble on this 
hyperization with ammonia as opposed to cold

23:24.095 --> 23:29.566
water that Mount Wilson used? It had been around 
for a while. I don't know who invented it. It had

23:32.751 --> 23:38.462
been in the folklore before Guido, but I had not 
used it. I don't know who heard about it, but Munch

23:39.438 --> 23:43.002
knew a bit more about it than I. Whose idea was it to 
go after Mars, that particular maximum doppler

23:43.343 --> 23:48.969
ship? No, that was mine. Okay. Just a natural 
carryover from the Victorias. And then what, you

23:53.895 --> 23:56.739
broached it to Guido and he used it? Yeah, and he had 
time coming up, so it was all his time. We didn't get

23:58.881 --> 24:01.665
any new time or special director's discretion for 
it or not. On the other hand, Munch wasn't about to

24:04.075 --> 24:06.599
have anybody push him off the telescope for any 
reason. I mean, it was his time, man. He'd do what he

24:07.961 --> 24:09.844
darn well pleased, senor. And how did Luke Kaplan 
get involved in it? Kaplan was in the game. At that

24:14.751 --> 24:19.579
time, he was then the section leader on the basis of 
encouragement. I mean, he was an advocate of doing

24:19.599 --> 24:25.868
these things, as well as preparing for space 
experiments. And what happened, fortunately, is

24:25.888 --> 24:32.378
that Munch and I went up to the mountain. Guido 
showed me how to use the 100-inch Coudet, which

24:32.577 --> 24:35.541
wasn't all that trivial. I felt slightly 
overwhelmed, but we used it. And the first night,

24:39.066 --> 24:43.232
we tried a one-end plate on Mars. It was a pretty 
good night, and it came out all right, but it wasn't

24:43.293 --> 24:46.477
anything outstanding. Then we tried a four-end 
that we had hyped that afternoon, and it was

24:46.497 --> 24:52.586
useless because we had overexposed it. It was too 
sensitive. We figured it was going to be less

24:53.968 --> 24:57.353
sensitive than the one-end, but it was actually 
more sensitive. So that was useless. Which was not

24:58.516 --> 24:59.719
the party line. It was not the conventional 
wisdom. Well, if you don't hype them, it's down a

25:01.262 --> 25:03.788
factor of 50, roughly. So the hypersensitization 
was extraordinarily effective. I mean, it's an

25:08.338 --> 25:10.363
art, like grinding up lizards and things, 
witchcraft. Here are my scars from McDonald. Yes,

25:14.088 --> 25:15.810
that's right. When you do this in the dark, besides 
sniffing the ammonia, it's subject to occasional

25:15.850 --> 25:23.198
failure of all sorts. I mean, the blood doesn't 
really help much. Okay, so you're on your second

25:25.079 --> 25:26.541
night now. Yeah, the second night, Guido had left. 
Guido had other activities besides astronomy and

25:29.864 --> 25:37.112
didn't want to stay up in the mountain for the whole 
run, which I think was actually scheduled for four

25:29.864 --> 25:37.112
nights. This is Now, April 12, 1963. So I exposed a 
four-end plate to Mars for, I don't know, over the

25:41.432 --> 25:46.920
order of three hours. I don't remember the exact 
exposure time. And we got a spectrogram, and I was

25:50.204 --> 25:52.388
going to start another one. Mars was at 
quadrature, of course, to get the velocity, but I

25:54.310 --> 25:58.436
guess it was far enough north that you could do more 
than one. So I started the next one, and it clouded

25:59.478 --> 26:02.221
up. So I had plenty of time to go in and develop the 
plate. waiting for the clouds to go away, or Mars to

26:05.508 --> 26:09.272
set, or whatever was going to happen. And I looked 
at it, and I could tell it was a good plate. Even

26:11.013 --> 26:13.355
then, slightly overexposed, but not much. Had 
fairly good spatial resolution, good spectral

26:13.435 --> 26:20.442
resolution, nice contrast on a forend, which is 
one of the reasons you use it. And then basically, I

26:21.483 --> 26:28.469
put it aside and said, hey, I'll get a few of these, 
and we'll look at them, or we'll add them all up, or

26:21.483 --> 26:28.469
do something terribly clever. No one had thought 
of digital things then, of course, because it was

26:28.930 --> 26:34.435
still analog type of analysis. And I put it away. 
Well, unfortunately, it wasn't just clouds. The

26:38.912 --> 26:40.615
next day, it got colder and colder. And finally, it 
started snowing. So the rest of the run was wiped

26:43.038 --> 26:44.480
out. I came home kind of disconsolate, having one 
probably pretty good plate. But I don't know. I

26:53.073 --> 26:54.375
didn't see anything in the hypo. So I didn't make a 
big deal of it and sort of got on with my life for a

26:54.415 --> 26:58.722
couple of days. After a few days, I said, oh, my. 
Let's look at the thing and see if at least we can see

27:01.105 --> 27:04.110
the water lines visually. And maybe they'll show 
up. By golly, I think they did, especially over one

27:06.562 --> 27:11.550
third of the exposure. I'm not sure I knew exactly 
which way it was up at the time. I had to figure out

27:14.735 --> 27:16.498
which polar cap it was. But they were there. But the 
outstanding thing was not noticed until about a

27:18.922 --> 27:23.710
week later. And for some reason, I decided to 
compare the spectrum of Mars to a Venus spectrum

27:24.247 --> 27:33.377
that I had from the same instrument taken by Dunham 
a long time ago. And of course, the quality of the

27:33.757 --> 27:37.521
new one, especially on a 4N, was far greater. But 
the nice thing about the Venus old spectrum was

27:37.822 --> 27:44.949
that it showed me where the 8689 carbon dioxide 
band was located. And by golly, when I looked at the

27:45.510 --> 27:50.035
Mars spectrum, there were the lines, much, much 
weaker, but unmistakable. And you could match

27:52.459 --> 27:53.760
them line for line. Yeah, it just blew me away. So I 
went hooping and hollering around the trailers,

27:56.023 --> 28:01.809
found Kaplan right away, had him look at it. He 
wasn't much used to looking at spectra, but he

28:01.829 --> 28:04.151
could see it too. And then called up Guido. He 
refused to believe it for a few minutes. I don't

28:09.516 --> 28:19.026
remember if he came up to look the same afternoon or 
the next day, but we knew right away that that meant

28:09.516 --> 28:19.026
that there was more carbon dioxide on Mars than 
people had reckoned before by a lot. Because this

28:22.745 --> 28:24.027
was intrinsically. It's a weak band. It doesn't 
depend very much on the gas pressure. Total gas

28:28.172 --> 28:31.156
pressure is mostly just dependent on the column of 
carbon dioxide. So it's an unavoidable

28:31.557 --> 28:35.603
conclusion that there had to be more CO2. So either 
there had to be more atmosphere on Mars than anyone

28:36.203 --> 28:43.133
thought, or the atmosphere, if thin, had to be 
predominantly carbon dioxide. And those were

28:43.153 --> 28:47.359
conclusions one could work out in your head 
without even calculating a number. So that was

28:48.773 --> 28:54.261
KMS-1, which got published on January 1, 1964. How 
did the JPL publicity department handle this? I

28:58.086 --> 28:59.388
can't remember. I think there was some interest in 
it. As you recall, you got a pressure of, what was

29:02.332 --> 29:06.939
it, finally? 25. 25 in that paper. 25 plus or minus 
15. And the standard Girard de Bacallure is

29:10.304 --> 29:13.708
80-ish? Yeah, 84 plus or minus 5 or 85 plus or minus 
4. I could check that out. But they were already

29:18.862 --> 29:22.627
designing entry capsules for the 85 millibar. 
Yeah, right. That was just about happening that

29:23.589 --> 29:27.154
way for, what was it, the first entry. Well, 
Mariner 4, of course, was supposed to be a flyby. It

29:29.377 --> 29:30.118
was a flyby. The first entry was a ways downstream, 
but clearly they needed to know that. So what did

29:35.245 --> 29:38.710
this do to planetary astronomy? Well, as soon as 
anybody believed it, which happened actually

29:39.685 --> 29:47.696
pretty quickly because Owen and Kuiper got 
confirming observations relatively quickly. I

29:48.057 --> 29:49.779
don't remember if it was exactly the same season. 
How long between quadratures? Six, not that long.

29:55.708 --> 29:56.729
Maybe they got it on the other side. I don't know. It 
might not have been that season. Four months?

29:59.173 --> 30:01.035
Yeah, or maybe six. But anyway, it wasn't a real 
long time. So it got confirmed like in a year or

30:03.098 --> 30:05.061
less. And then people definitely were taking it 
seriously. reexamining old archives and mostly

30:09.014 --> 30:24.476
reexamining the assumptions that went into the 
surface pressure determinations, which then

30:09.014 --> 30:24.476
looked, after a while, a lot weaker than they had in 
1963. Now, you recall that I was at headquarters

30:27.880 --> 30:33.248
during some of this time, from 63 in June to 
September in 64. And during that time, John Strong

30:33.408 --> 30:49.892
came in with a balloon flight that found an 
enormous amount of, well, many times more water

30:33.408 --> 30:49.892
vapor in the atmosphere of Mars than you did,

30:33.408 --> 30:49.892
which caused great consternation at 
headquarters. And at least in headquarters, the

30:50.613 --> 30:56.622
people who weren't spectroscopists said, well, 
we don't know who to believe. What did you think

30:57.378 --> 30:58.920
about it? Well, you know, water can be temporal up 
to a point, right? So you could imagine changes.

31:04.565 --> 31:06.827
But, you know, I was a relatively brash young man. I 
tend to believe what I do. Well, he had something

31:08.429 --> 31:15.016
like 85,

31:08.429 --> 31:15.016
what units did we used to use? Precipitable 
microns, I think. Great units. Averaged over the

31:17.878 --> 31:19.420
entire disk. Yeah, enormously higher. I would 
have said 10 or 15 over the North Pole. I think

31:22.843 --> 31:24.085
that's what we did say. Mm-hmm. Okay, now, when I 
got back to headquarters there, that was that

31:25.137 --> 31:41.216
Harlan Smith was now in high gear at the University 
of Texas, and he and I had started the 107-inch, and

31:25.137 --> 31:41.216
as I recall, you and I got a run at McDonald's. 
82-inch. 82-inch, which lasted a month. Yeah, it

31:44.360 --> 31:45.381
was incredible. And I guess I got there a week or so 
earlier because the big photograph was in pieces.

31:51.188 --> 31:51.549
Right. You put it together completely. I never got 
in that stage. Okay. It was probably more than a

31:55.360 --> 31:56.743
week. When this first... That was December of... 
Of 64. 64, I think. Yeah, that's right. When you

32:04.136 --> 32:06.781
first heard of this, how did... I forget now how 
this went. I mean, who did Harlan call? You or me or

32:09.746 --> 32:11.109
both of us? If I know, probably both of us. And then I 
recall I was upstairs guiding or ammoniating or

32:13.163 --> 32:27.910
developing or something, and I came down, and you 
and Harlan were outside the library at the 82-inch

32:13.163 --> 32:27.910
arranging the observing schedule for the next 
year, which must have been a very unusual

32:13.163 --> 32:27.910
situation for you. What about face? Famine to 
feast? Completely unusual. It doesn't happen now

32:30.294 --> 32:31.817
either, believe me. Would you say that for a long 
time... McDonald was the only place where it was

32:37.902 --> 32:44.890
not only safe, not only popular, but even safe to do 
planetary astronomy. Well, it was all changing.

32:46.111 --> 32:56.082
By 64 and 65, while it might not have been the focus 
of everyone's pride and attention, it was no

32:46.111 --> 32:56.082
longer in the closet, so to speak. And by the time I 
got back to Berkeley as a faculty member... Which

33:01.308 --> 33:01.788
was? Which was in February 64... and then I could 
use Lick, automatic write, I could ask for coup de

33:06.067 --> 33:12.974
time to do whatever darn well I pleased, and I did. 
So I worked on Venus and Mars at Lick. In fact, some

33:15.356 --> 33:22.323
of our joint paper on the Mars water and CO2 for that 
opposition comes from Lick and a little bit more

33:15.356 --> 33:22.323
from McDonald's. So it was okay. I mean, I don't 
know if people cared one way or the other then. I

33:25.686 --> 33:31.892
think it was clear then that exploring the planets 
was going to be interesting both from the ground

33:25.686 --> 33:31.892
and from spacecraft. So it just wasn't as... as 
haute culture to look down your nose at planetary

33:35.817 --> 33:39.982
astronomy. So that was beginning to change. On the 
other hand, McDonald's was a place that one could

33:41.383 --> 33:45.468
really do a lot. Herbig would get a few spectra 
every year and then actually tire of it. I did it for

33:49.953 --> 33:55.660
a few years, and Larry Giver as a student did a 
little bit with Herbig. But other than that, there

33:55.700 --> 33:59.344
wasn't a lot of planetary astronomy. Kit Peake 
started coming in, so people like Toby Owen.

34:02.138 --> 34:02.739
Exactly. Now, Kit Peake didn't have all the 
prejudices of the past. They didn't have that

34:05.483 --> 34:07.587
excess strange baggage. The only thing Kit Peake 
might have had a little prejudice against, but I

34:08.248 --> 34:16.141
don't think it really ever showed, was 
Kuiper-type jealousy when Kuiper was across the

34:08.248 --> 34:16.141
street at U of A. But I don't think that mattered. 
And Kuiper had his slightly smaller telescopes on

34:17.082 --> 34:23.493
northeast of Tucson. So by then, the 
observational effect was getting pretty good.

34:27.016 --> 34:29.800
Yeah, but McDonald was a unique thing at first. The 
first years of the 82-inch Coudet, and then you

34:29.840 --> 34:40.954
know more about the 107-inch, which actually I've 
never used than I, but that was a wonderful

34:29.840 --> 34:40.954
opportunity. So it went from famine to feast. Why 
did you leave

34:42.896 --> 34:47.522
JPL? Oh, partly because of the frustration of not 
having a telescope that I could say I had a real bite

34:48.312 --> 35:07.355
on, and partly for family reasons to get back in the 
Bay Area, and partly because I was more interested

34:48.312 --> 35:07.355
in having an academic-type career than one at a 
place where things were a little bit more

34:48.312 --> 35:07.355
regimented. Although JPL, I'd say in general, 
treated me quite well. I was probably treated

35:10.819 --> 35:17.847
better than the average scientist there that was 
supposed to have a functional job to help

35:10.819 --> 35:17.847
coordinate spacecraft things. between 
engineers and scientists, for example, and they

35:18.181 --> 35:25.651
ended up doing 10% functional work instead of 50%, 
so I can't complain about that. But the

35:26.231 --> 35:32.519
environment was not quite what I had wanted to do 
for the rest of my career. So in 1964, I moved from

35:34.121 --> 35:38.066
Pasadena. Why did you slowly drift out of 
planetary work? Because there were

35:42.853 --> 35:44.254
opportunities all over. I'm interested in the 
whole universe, and... I still do commentary

35:47.830 --> 35:49.032
work. One of my students is working on Io. So I did it 
indirectly. I'm never completely out of it. I

35:55.605 --> 35:56.827
certainly don't do it full time. And I'm not up with 
the literature the way I might have been at one

35:56.867 --> 36:00.795
time. But it's part of the universe that I enjoy. 
And it's near enough that you can use different

36:03.620 --> 36:06.406
techniques. If the techniques get too easy or the 
spacecraft do it all, then clearly I would look for

36:10.527 --> 36:13.712
something a little more challenging. Just as a 
little personal aside, what was your first

36:13.912 --> 36:20.803
meeting with Harlan Smith, and how did he impress 
you?

36:23.287 --> 36:33.362
I corresponded with Smitty about RLR stars a 
little bit, because he did his thesis on light

36:23.287 --> 36:33.362
curves of RLR stars, I believe, or something like 
that at Yale. And I was interested in doing that as a

36:34.784 --> 36:37.328
student project under the direction to some 
extent of George Preston when I was a second-year

36:38.118 --> 36:49.750
graduate student before I knew the names of the 
satellites of Saturn or what Gibbous meant.

36:53.093 --> 36:55.936
I don't know when I met him first physically. Well, 
he certainly wasn't like your typical Mont Wilson

36:57.037 --> 37:01.181
Palomar director, was he? No, no. Smitty was a very 
open uh not necessarily wearing a tie and stiff

37:03.683 --> 37:30.535
shirt type person would never known he was an 
observatory director while the prototype the

37:03.683 --> 37:30.535
prototypical director of the early 60s was 
someone that you know had grown up in an earlier

37:03.683 --> 37:30.535
time and was much more formal than that uh what was 
planetary astronomy like when you started in 61

37:03.683 --> 37:30.535
and 62

37:33.282 --> 37:48.842
small, in some disrepute, but with enough 
promise, just because it hadn't been attacked

37:33.282 --> 37:48.842
very much, that it looked interesting, and also, 
of course, the prospect of getting direct

37:33.282 --> 37:48.842
information from the space probes, if they had 
ever worked at the time. When I started in 61,

37:49.362 --> 37:56.592
nothing was working, and Rangers were crashing 
into the Moon, and we couldn't get to the Moon

37:49.362 --> 37:56.592
successfully, let alone Mars or Venus. So it 
looked like it might be a bit of a long haul, but

37:57.052 --> 38:00.877
clearly the impetus was there. It was a national 
goal to do the moon and beyond. So I figured that

38:04.927 --> 38:11.835
there would be lots of opportunities in 
non-traditional astronomy, if not the

38:04.927 --> 38:11.835
traditional. But of course, it turned out the 
traditional was still wide open also. What do you

38:15.699 --> 38:19.764
think is the best piece of work in planetary 
astronomy you've done? We're going to chisel on a

38:19.784 --> 38:21.466
tombstone. Oh, my.

38:25.650 --> 38:31.437
Certainly the most dramatic and the part I can 
relive if I feel self-depressed is that detection

38:32.142 --> 38:34.565
of CO2 on the Mars spectrogram. That was the one 
moment where it all flashed in front of you. As soon

38:38.350 --> 38:49.285
as I saw the lines, believed they were real, I knew 
in less time than it takes the neurons to move

38:38.350 --> 38:49.285
around, I guess, that this was important because 
there was a lot more CO2 than people had thought.

38:49.345 --> 38:51.648
Actually, working out the detailed surface 
pressure took a little while. That, I think, is the

38:52.409 --> 38:56.414
flashiest thing. It turned out to be more or less 
right. What was the most fun? that or something

39:01.690 --> 39:26.500
else well that was fun instantaneously i don't 
know all of it's fun all of it's fine uh we already

39:01.690 --> 39:26.500
talked about dead ends or misfires so we'll skip 
lots of those i mean working on comets now is a lot of

39:01.690 --> 39:26.500
fun they're pretty pretty fascinating get 
surprises comets never comets were always

39:01.690 --> 39:26.500
acceptable uh isn't that even in the 20s and 30s I 
wonder why. I mean, the physics was a little bit

39:27.811 --> 39:32.956
more like stellar or gaseous nebulae 
astrophysics, a little bit. The people that did

39:33.877 --> 39:40.243
the laboratory stuff and identifications for 
comets were well-regarded folks. Phillips did C2

39:41.464 --> 39:43.646
and Cn. Identifications of other things were by 
Swings, who certainly was a famous and extremely

39:44.467 --> 39:51.094
well-regarded astronomer, no matter what he did. 
I don't know if that's the reason or not. No, you

39:53.596 --> 39:55.558
weren't a pariah if you worked on comets. I mean, 
Greenstein did it in 1956. Nobody seemed to mind.

40:00.683 --> 40:09.998
Have

40:00.683 --> 40:09.998
you had any direct NSA funding since you left JPL? 
Yeah, yeah. How have they treated you? I mean,

40:13.263 --> 40:14.525
normally. Do you think the folks at headquarters 
or whoever's handling your stuff understand what

40:15.347 --> 40:19.634
you're doing? Do they keep up with this? Yeah, 
because Rahe is the program director. And when I'm

40:23.467 --> 40:30.614
working on comments, he probably knows almost as 
much about the specific subject as I. I've been

40:23.467 --> 40:30.614
treated well by them in recent years. So no gripes 
about mismanagement, micromanagement, or

40:31.936 --> 40:36.100
anything like that? Not at all, no. Do they try and 
tell you what to do? Nope. Not now.

40:44.849 --> 40:47.892
I mean, I get review remarks from the committees. 
The scientific review committees aren't always

40:48.052 --> 40:50.915
flattering. But that's normal, isn't it? Where do 
you think planetary astronomy would be today

40:53.825 --> 41:00.872
without NASA?

41:00.892 --> 41:03.354
It's very hard to tell whether it would have ever 
caught on again. It would have. Somebody would

41:04.395 --> 41:09.901
have blundered across something by accident that 
would have turned it around. But it might have

41:09.961 --> 41:12.123
taken a long, long time. I mean, it was in a deep well 
for not its own fault for some years. And it's very

41:16.787 --> 41:17.668
hard to say. But for NASA, in its own 
blunderbuss-type approach, I think it helped.

41:24.166 --> 41:30.354
Which brings me to the point, all the participants 
are dead, so all we've got is the opinions of live

41:24.166 --> 41:30.354
people. What do you think killed astronomy, 
basically killed as an active field? I know there

41:34.959 --> 41:39.665
was a little bit done in the 20s and 30s and 40s in 
planetary astronomy. But it was a moribund field.

41:41.387 --> 41:43.130
And at the turn of the century, it was not. Was it 
that other fields opened up, or that they ran into

41:44.211 --> 41:53.042
instrumental barriers, like no good infrared 
detectors, or just what? It's hard to say.

41:54.985 --> 41:55.666
Percival Lowell? Lowell did something, but that 
was earlier. I don't think that should have had an

41:58.429 --> 42:03.156
effect from, say, the 40s through 1960. But there 
were so few people of competence in the field in the

42:05.158 --> 42:10.886
late 50s. I mean, Kuiper and who else was there? 
Chamberlain was just getting started. I don't

42:15.532 --> 42:19.998
know if he was a full-fledged planetary 
astronomer or would have called himself that or

42:15.532 --> 42:19.998
something else. Who else was outstanding in 
planetary astronomy. Erpik did a lot of other

42:22.546 --> 42:23.808
things. He did some planetary astronomy that was 
good, but of course in the States that didn't get

42:23.848 --> 42:28.314
recognition at the time. And swings, of course, in 
Europe, but that was a part-time affair for him. I

42:36.326 --> 42:36.666
don't know. I mean, Kuiper, of course, had a 
reputation that was antagonistic, so people

42:36.686 --> 42:43.616
didn't like him personally in some cases. That may 
have played some role, but basically I'm not quite

42:44.157 --> 42:47.802
sure I can put my finger on it, but Certainly other 
fields of astronomy and astrophysics seem to have

42:48.220 --> 42:56.227
more simplistic and direct physical answers. The 
problems are tough on planets. I mean, in the case

42:57.849 --> 43:05.355
of the rocky planets, I'll include Mars mostly in 
that, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and then the small

42:57.849 --> 43:05.355
things. Basically, it was thought that only 
geologists could have an impact there. And then

43:09.139 --> 43:13.983
the atmosphere of Venus was, well, studied by 
Dunham and Adams. And they found CO2. And what can

43:15.524 --> 43:17.586
you do after that? So the field was thought to be 
sterile. New techniques hadn't advanced to the

43:21.246 --> 43:25.070
point where they could make a big contribution. 
For example, if we had infrared detectors of high

43:25.130 --> 43:36.062
quality and infrared spectrometers in 1960, the 
way we do in 1990-something, clearly that would

43:25.130 --> 43:36.062
have opened up a lot of doors. But it seemed to be a 
combination. I'm not sure there's a terribly easy

43:41.067 --> 43:44.451
explanation for it. I've been asking certain 
people particularly about the formation of the

43:44.819 --> 44:04.718
DPS and Icarus, but this holds for all fields of 
astronomy in this country, where 30 years ago all

43:44.819 --> 44:04.718
we had was an American Astronomical Society, 
basically, and then we had the APJ and the AJ, and

43:44.819 --> 44:04.718
that was kind of it. ASP. ASP, right. That was very 
local, though. But that was about it. Now we have

44:08.202 --> 44:14.488
these separate divisions of the American 
Astronomical Society, and most of them, or a lot of

44:08.202 --> 44:14.488
them, with their own journals. Is this good or bad? 
I still cling to the outmoded thought that it would

44:19.768 --> 44:29.238
be nice to be such a sufficiently good generalist 
that you could know a fair amount about

44:19.768 --> 44:29.238
everything. For example, in today's AAS meeting 
program, Schneider gave a talk on the Io Taurus and

44:30.519 --> 44:40.269
Io volcanoes, and there was a very, very good 
audience of mostly non-planetary people. So

44:40.749 --> 44:44.593
there's still some semblance of people wanting at 
least no highlights about everything. So in a way,

44:45.383 --> 44:50.671
it would be nice to have everything in a couple of 
journals because one's office isn't big enough to

44:45.383 --> 44:50.671
take them all now. But the journals would be 
thicker then. But the journals would be thicker

44:51.873 --> 44:54.016
and unmanageable. So I don't know. I still think 
it's kind of unfortunate that we have to

44:56.019 --> 45:01.948
specialize, but there's no choice. We can survive 
this way too. In the so-called good old days, did

45:04.292 --> 45:10.922
stellar and planetary astronomers ever talk to 
each other anyway? I think some of them did.

45:14.830 --> 45:26.481
Well, here's a good question, which your point 
about the talk about the EOTOR has brought up, and

45:14.830 --> 45:26.481
this has to do with AAS having invited review 
papers. Do you think that, because of things like

45:26.561 --> 45:43.656
that and a perhaps more open attitude on both sides 
than we had thirty years ago, that, for example,

45:26.561 --> 45:43.656
planetary and real astronomers talk more than 
they used to thirty years ago, or less, or about the

45:26.561 --> 45:43.656
same?

45:44.868 --> 46:00.125
For example, there's a large interest in the folks 
that do star formation in the early solar system

45:44.868 --> 46:00.125
now, because they're trying to find analogs of the 
early solar system in the Taurus cloud and other

45:44.868 --> 46:00.125
obscured places, molecular clouds where young 
stars form. So they're quite interested in

46:00.145 --> 46:06.592
planetary astronomy at some level, maybe not in 
the geology of every rock on Mars or the moon. But at

46:07.152 --> 46:08.974
some level, they're definitely interested. So I 
think, in fact, things are a little bit better And

46:13.100 --> 46:14.882
there's moderately good communication. So I 
think having invited talks on subjects where

46:14.902 --> 46:23.310
there's overlap is very healthy and probably 
successful. So AAS in its biannual meeting is, to

46:23.931 --> 46:29.156
some extent, doing that. I don't know if the 
planetary division ever has a talk. I think they

46:33.540 --> 46:41.508
do, by people interested, for example, in star 
formation, which is at least indirectly related

46:33.540 --> 46:41.508
to planetary formation. That happens sometimes. 
You think a planetary astronomy is a part of

46:42.817 --> 46:45.040
astronomy? Sure. I might have a minority view on 
that. Yeah, it is. It is. A lot of the techniques are

46:50.807 --> 46:52.249
the same. A lot of them are different. If you go to 
the DPS, you don't hear a tremendous amount about

46:54.232 --> 47:00.380
other fields of astronomy, but you do hear 
something. Yeah, I think scientists now are

47:02.502 --> 47:09.972
multidisciplined enough in their brains to 
realize that a sharp division is artificial.

47:10.306 --> 47:14.617
Well, I know the DPS, I've seen coronagraph 
pictures of some nearby stars. Yeah, sure.

47:16.121 --> 47:16.563
Absolutely. This, again, is a personal thing, but 
I'm going to try and build up a consensus.
