WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:06.689
We're on North Central Expressway, testing, testing.

00:07.990 --> 00:11.655
I'm here, and I'm one of the testees, I guess.

00:14.059 --> 00:16.041
This is September 28.

00:16.121 --> 00:20.547
I have the honor of chatting with Mr. H.R.

00:20.587 --> 00:23.852
Bright about his A&M days.

00:24.532 --> 00:31.742
Mr. Bright, to begin this, describe your growing up and family and...

00:32.313 --> 00:35.797
Describe your days before you went to A&M.

00:36.978 --> 00:37.598
All right, sir.

00:38.259 --> 00:42.123
I am one of two children.

00:42.543 --> 00:48.449
My father is born and bred in North Carolina and attended North Carolina University.

00:50.411 --> 00:52.874
Has a very deep southern accent.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.458
My wife's a North Carolinian.

00:56.518 --> 00:58.860
Where was home for him?

01:00.123 --> 01:12.739
Well, he lived in a little town in eastern North Carolina, Chakawinity.

01:12.759 --> 01:16.724
And they apparently had a good deal of land there.

01:16.764 --> 01:26.757
And, but it was, Chakawinity was a town of about 800 people and still is.

01:28.459 --> 01:29.320
And that was...

01:29.907 --> 01:36.393
where he was born and bred and, and he attended the University of North Carolina.

01:38.575 --> 01:53.669
Uh, married my mother, uh, who was born in Joplin, Missouri, and uh, but her family was raised here in Texas and in Oklahoma.

01:56.131 --> 01:56.792
And uh,

01:58.325 --> 02:09.922
Dad, uh, he came to Texas to, uh, because Texas was an expanding community.

02:12.145 --> 02:26.646
Uh, got here at about the time they opened Oklahoma from, uh, they had the land rush in this and he went to Oklahoma.

02:26.666 --> 02:27.707
My mother's

02:27.957 --> 02:33.104
sister lived in Oklahoma.

02:34.346 --> 02:35.668
They lived in Muskogee.

02:37.310 --> 02:51.130
And my father, after he graduated from the University of North Carolina, went to Atlanta, and he was knocked in the head when he was up in the capital and robbed.

02:51.515 --> 03:09.796
and he decided he didn't want to be in Atlanta, and he came to the new country, which was Oklahoma, and started a drug store, and that's where he met my mother, and they were married, and they had two children.

03:09.897 --> 03:19.648
My sister is two years older than I, and she was first born, and then I was born, and then

03:20.810 --> 03:23.834
My father sold his drug store and went to work for H.K.

03:24.555 --> 03:26.918
Mulford, as I stated earlier.

03:28.220 --> 03:32.546
Mulford was sold to Sharpen Dome, and he got a job with Johnson & Johnson.

03:33.988 --> 03:37.974
And we were in Dallas, I guess, at that time.

03:38.114 --> 03:39.696
I'mâ€”I don't really know.

03:41.358 --> 03:47.627
But, uh, then my mother got sick, and

03:49.295 --> 04:03.111
Uh, she went to Oklahoma for Uncle Tom, her sister's uh, husband, to help take care of her.

04:03.772 --> 04:07.296
And uh, this was after she and Dad were married.

04:08.758 --> 04:11.581
And I was actually born in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

04:13.183 --> 04:16.247
And uh, early years.

04:16.987 --> 04:22.893
Well, when Dad got the job with Johnson & Johnson, we opened up the territory west of the Mississippi.

04:24.474 --> 04:26.997
My first recollection is St.

04:27.037 --> 04:28.058
Joseph, Missouri.

04:29.679 --> 04:44.293
Then, uh, we moved from there to Omaha, from Omaha to, uh, some place in

04:45.657 --> 04:49.122
Iowa, and I just had no recollection of it.

04:50.284 --> 04:56.393
We landed in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and that's where my real first memories begin.

04:56.413 --> 05:05.387
And we were in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and I started the school in Sioux Falls.

05:06.468 --> 05:08.391
And then we came back to Dallas.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.748
when I was probably in the second grade.

05:12.990 --> 05:16.895
And by this time, he was working for J&J.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.801
And what, I don't know J&J.

05:22.041 --> 05:23.102
Johnson & Johnson.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.024
Oh, Johnson & Johnson.

05:24.424 --> 05:27.087
So did he travel calling on customers?

05:27.208 --> 05:27.608
Yes.

05:28.229 --> 05:29.851
He was a salesman for them.

05:30.772 --> 05:31.333
How did he go?

05:31.413 --> 05:31.914
By train?

05:32.614 --> 05:33.576
No, he drove.

05:33.896 --> 05:34.016
Oh.

05:35.598 --> 05:38.682
And he...

05:40.130 --> 05:48.322
We lived in an apartment first, and then we moved to a house.

05:49.323 --> 05:58.877
And then my mother had been a school teacher when she was young, and she decided that the Highland Park schools were the best schools.

06:00.099 --> 06:09.192
And so we moved into a little two-bedroom house in Highland Park on Auburndale, the only house on Auburndale.

06:10.522 --> 06:31.525
And also at that time, I was probably in the second grade, and mother decided that I was too old to be sleeping in the same room with my sister, so I had to sleep on the couch every night.

06:31.825 --> 06:38.993
And I'd go to bed in their bed when they had company, and they'd move me to the couch.

06:39.817 --> 07:06.358
Then we got a three bedroom house and I had my own bedroom and we rented that house for a number of years and then the house down the street on Mockingbird Lane became vacant and dad bought that house and that's where I really spent the majority of my young life and went to A&M from that house.

07:06.378 --> 07:07.900
You finished high school in what year?

07:09.247 --> 07:15.994
Uh, in 30, I think 37.

07:16.014 --> 07:16.635
Okay.

07:18.197 --> 07:21.160
Do you have any idea how many were in the senior class at Highland Park?

07:22.041 --> 07:24.703
About how many graduated with you?

07:27.006 --> 07:29.589
No, now we're talking about high school.

07:29.609 --> 07:29.829
Yes, sir.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.030
I was thinking of grade school.

07:32.011 --> 07:32.071
No.

07:32.091 --> 07:35.575
No, I was in high school.

07:37.006 --> 07:37.987
I got out in 39.

07:38.148 --> 07:40.531
Oh, oh.

07:41.292 --> 07:51.986
And, uh, we, then, uh, I worked for two years until I got to go to A&M.

07:52.767 --> 08:00.718
Well, I got, must have gotten out in 37 and I worked for two years and went to, uh, A&M.

08:01.137 --> 08:03.641
Why did you go to A&M instead of some other school?

08:03.901 --> 08:11.812
Because I could go room, board, books, tuition, A&M for $525 two semesters.

08:11.832 --> 08:16.219
Had you been down ever to visit A&M before you went down to... I had never been there.

08:16.239 --> 08:29.878
I had heard of it, and when I was a little kid, and they used to play SMU in football, I'd go up there because they had a fence,

08:31.428 --> 08:32.910
behind Ownby Stadium.

08:33.771 --> 08:36.453
There'd be three or four hundred Aggies lined up there.

08:36.493 --> 08:42.840
And just before the game started, they'd start piling over the fence.

08:44.222 --> 08:53.251
And when I was little, they'd throw me across the fence and some Aggies on the other side would catch me.

08:53.532 --> 08:54.152
Oh, how good.

08:54.833 --> 09:00.439
And you could go in and if you ran real fast, they never caught you.

09:01.128 --> 09:05.433
What impression did you have of A&M before you got there?

09:07.655 --> 09:11.059
That it was an all-male, all-military school.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.602
And that's all I knew about it.

09:13.802 --> 09:24.395
I knew they had the Southwest Conference at that time, and I saw SMU playing them every other year.

09:26.056 --> 09:27.859
But I knew little about it.

09:28.259 --> 09:30.021
You didn't have any real close buddies.

09:30.608 --> 09:31.549
that had gone down there?

09:31.729 --> 09:33.231
No, did not.

09:33.451 --> 09:39.499
When you went down to, for the first time, to register, how did you get there?

09:40.079 --> 09:40.720
By train.

09:41.421 --> 09:42.963
And did you go by yourself?

09:43.323 --> 09:43.664
Yes.

09:44.344 --> 09:46.547
What did you take on that train with you?

09:47.188 --> 09:52.054
I had a footlocker and a grip.

09:52.074 --> 09:55.157
A grip full of clothes and a footlocker full of clothes.

09:56.479 --> 09:59.923
And no uniforms.

10:01.152 --> 10:11.309
When I got out of the train, I took the footlocker and I'd carry it about 200 feet and I'd come back and get the grip and carry it up.

10:12.371 --> 10:25.793
And I had received my entry level or whatever you have, whatever you receive to get to go to school.

10:27.595 --> 10:32.262
I knew I was, had been assigned a room in A-10 Hart Hall.

10:32.903 --> 10:34.005
In Hart, okay.

10:34.265 --> 10:48.287
And I got closer to, I got off the train station, I got closer to the campus and I asked somebody where Hart Hall was and they told me and I,

10:48.892 --> 10:57.763
asked what A-10 meant and they told me and I got my stuff up there and put it in my room.

10:59.105 --> 11:04.071
And what did the campus look like to you when you first looked at it?

11:04.551 --> 11:06.213
What impression did it make?

11:06.514 --> 11:18.308
It was big and it was big but I had lived right by SMU and it looked about like SMU did

11:18.828 --> 11:21.031
in that day and time.

11:21.993 --> 11:27.721
And did any Aggies say anything to you as you're toting that footlocker?

11:27.781 --> 11:28.222
Yes.

11:29.664 --> 11:40.280
There was a fellow who was a sophomore or junior, I don't recall which, and he helped me carry the footlocker.

11:40.360 --> 11:46.810
He carried one end and I had hold of the other end and he helped me in that.

11:47.431 --> 11:52.781
showed me where Hart Hall was and how to get to A-Ramp and how to get up there.

11:54.124 --> 12:01.839
And I never, I probably saw him again, but I don't remember his name, but he was just an Aggie.

12:01.859 --> 12:03.061
He was an upperclassman.

12:03.522 --> 12:10.435
When you left home, do you remember anything your parents said to you as you went away that first trip?

12:11.883 --> 12:20.451
My dad told me that he was spending a lot of money sending me to college and he wanted me to apply myself and do good.

12:20.571 --> 12:22.933
And my mother said, you write every day.

12:26.716 --> 12:30.360
They took me down and put me on the train and sent me off.

12:31.461 --> 12:38.887
And did you take the money with you to pay that tuition and fees?

12:39.168 --> 12:39.628
No.

12:39.845 --> 12:42.208
How much money did you take with you?

12:44.091 --> 12:51.282
I probably had $8 to $10, and that was a lot of money at that time to me.

12:52.123 --> 12:52.363
All right.

12:52.403 --> 12:54.466
Describe getting settled into that room.

12:55.308 --> 13:01.356
Went up to the room, and a friend that I had known in high school.

13:01.917 --> 13:09.328
Now, I got out of high school, and I'd worked two years, and he really had been a year behind me.

13:09.815 --> 13:16.763
He was my age, but I had been double-promoted several times, three times in grade school.

13:18.444 --> 13:21.267
And he and I happened to be assigned as roommates.

13:22.048 --> 13:22.569
What was his name?

13:22.689 --> 13:26.553
His name was Herbert Schiff, C-H-I-F-F.

13:28.115 --> 13:35.603
And what had happened, Herbert had went to high school with me, but was a year behind me, and he got out.

13:36.528 --> 13:52.798
And he went to SMU for a year and Herbert was half Jewish and he was not in the fraternity and he didn't like SMU for that reason and so he transferred to A&M.

13:54.061 --> 14:08.964
where you had no fraternities, but he was a classified sophomore and I was a classified freshman, but Herbert wasn't a very good student and he wound up, we graduated in the same group.

14:10.706 --> 14:21.182
And how soon was it before some sophomore or junior came in to give you all a little, an introduction to A&M?

14:23.677 --> 14:26.281
I really have no recollection of that.

14:26.501 --> 14:51.220
I do remember that our battery commander was a guy named Bill Slayton, who had known and dated my sister, and I knew who he was, and he came and was very nice to us and very nice to me, and I had known him previously.

14:52.634 --> 14:57.841
And so how long did it take to get your uniforms?

14:57.981 --> 14:58.482
Do you remember?

15:01.506 --> 15:03.990
Well, now we used government-issued uniforms.

15:04.030 --> 15:06.493
They furnished the uniforms.

15:06.513 --> 15:09.518
And I think it was in the first two or three days.

15:10.719 --> 15:18.490
I probably went down there a week ahead of school starting and we had our uniforms and I had my slide room bought.

15:19.516 --> 15:22.940
everything by the time school started.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.884
And you were sure you wanted to be a petroleum engineer?

15:29.987 --> 15:33.431
Yes, I was pretty sure I wanted to be a petroleum engineer.

15:34.793 --> 15:48.848
And a lot of that came from my parents and my sister who was older than I and her boyfriend's advice when they'd come

15:49.435 --> 15:51.278
I was always Betty's little brother.

15:51.398 --> 15:59.209
Betty was a real popular girl and was always the class beauty, you know, and that stuff.

16:00.231 --> 16:16.354
And the older boys, two years older than I, during the high school days, they always knew who I was because I was Betty's little brother.

16:17.954 --> 16:24.283
Alright, y'all then, you began to fall out and y'all went to Chow in Duncan or in Cebesa?

16:24.303 --> 16:24.944
Cebesa.

16:25.444 --> 16:28.689
Describe the routine that begins.

16:30.311 --> 16:40.165
Well, when the outfit filled up and we were in A, B, and C in Hart Hall and

16:42.355 --> 16:53.733
The, you met the fellows and you learned that if you didn't know their name, you introduced yourself and you learned that in about the first twelve to fifteen hours you were on campus.

16:55.055 --> 17:08.616
And uh, we, I was down there probably two or three days ahead of school actually starting or even registration starting.

17:10.469 --> 17:25.085
They fed you in the mess hall, and I had little to do with getting me into school and getting me admitted.

17:25.445 --> 17:36.898
My parents had done that for me, but they had apparently done that ahead of time, because when I went down there, they knew who I was.

17:37.604 --> 17:41.008
in the registrar's office, and I guess the family had done that.

17:42.890 --> 17:52.021
And as you go into the dining hall, how did they introduce you to the nicknames of all the food and all the other traditions of the dining hall?

17:56.387 --> 18:05.738
They, I guess the sophomores did that pretty quick.

18:07.085 --> 18:12.313
And I learned that there was a difference between being a freshman and an upperclassman.

18:14.115 --> 18:16.920
Did you, did you get to sit at the hot corner sometimes?

18:17.921 --> 18:19.023
What's the hot corner?

18:19.043 --> 18:21.386
Oh, well that's, that wasn't in your day?

18:21.486 --> 18:21.727
No.

18:21.747 --> 18:27.936
And other, the freshmen, there were two freshmen had to sit at the corner and they passed everything to everybody else.

18:28.397 --> 18:29.418
They served the table.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.982
Well, we didn't have that.

18:32.102 --> 18:36.028
We did, uh, freshmen sat, uh,

18:38.675 --> 18:59.460
I don't recall that we had aâ€”we had a seat that was ours, but I don't recall that there was anything other than youâ€”this freshman couldn't eat until all the upperclassmen had their plate full.

19:00.221 --> 19:01.763
Did you eat square meals?

19:02.131 --> 19:04.134
No, we never did have that.

19:04.535 --> 19:06.397
Did you all have nicknames for the food?

19:06.718 --> 19:07.058
Yeah.

19:09.802 --> 19:11.124
What are some that you remember?

19:11.144 --> 19:12.807
Oh, I don't really remember them.

19:14.169 --> 19:15.210
Meat was bull neck?

19:15.451 --> 19:26.046
Bull neck, and milk was cow, and butter, I don't recall what they called it, and

19:27.207 --> 19:28.609
Mustard was baby.

19:29.250 --> 19:29.610
Yeah.

19:30.552 --> 19:39.644
When you got accustomed to those nicknames, did you ever come home and slip and forget and use some of those same words at the table at home?

19:40.225 --> 19:41.627
I don't recall that.

19:42.028 --> 19:44.011
I may have, but I don't recall it.

19:44.031 --> 19:47.556
A few of the people have said they got in trouble using some words at home.

19:47.756 --> 19:50.239
Yeah, that you used down there at school.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.843
Your outfits, did it have a nickname?

19:53.549 --> 19:56.153
No, we were D Battery Coast Artillery.

19:56.173 --> 19:57.335
But it didn't have a nickname?

19:57.495 --> 19:57.735
No.

19:59.057 --> 20:05.206
How long before you freshmen acquired a nickname, an individual nickname?

20:05.226 --> 20:07.430
Well, let me say this.

20:07.490 --> 20:15.301
There were some juniors and seniors there that had been in my sister's class and knew me as Betty's little brother.

20:16.563 --> 20:22.392
And they knew who I was and the CO of our outfit.

20:23.587 --> 20:53.188
had gone to the same high school as I and he was a senior and his name was Bill Slayton and uh he had had dates with my sister and he was uh he knew who I was and there were several people in the Coast Artillery who uh were from Highland Park and knew who I was not because of knowing me but because Betty was

20:53.995 --> 21:03.648
and they were upperclassmen and Betty was a very popular girl and they knew I was Betty's little brother.

21:04.228 --> 21:09.635
Did the nickname, did you, when did you acquire a nickname?

21:09.976 --> 21:15.223
When I must have been two weeks, three weeks old.

21:15.603 --> 21:16.965
Oh, so you grew up?

21:17.789 --> 21:19.853
Did that, and so that went to A&M with you?

21:19.933 --> 21:20.354
Yes.

21:20.434 --> 21:23.019
Did they, did those acquaintances call you?

21:23.399 --> 21:26.806
Oh yeah, everybody called me Brahman.

21:28.088 --> 21:31.815
They, the, my father,

21:32.757 --> 21:35.480
I was born in October, October 6th.

21:36.281 --> 21:42.088
Mother put me on the back porch, fixed breakfast.

21:42.108 --> 21:45.753
And the time Dad was up and shaved and dressed, he'd come out and look.

21:47.155 --> 21:49.117
And he had that deep southern accent.

21:49.938 --> 21:53.122
And my cheeks and nose would be red from the cold.

21:53.923 --> 21:58.609
Sugar, he looks like a little railroad bum.

21:58.629 --> 21:59.710
So that's...

21:59.690 --> 22:05.309
I was the little railroad bum and then I was bum.

22:05.329 --> 22:11.370
Do you remember some other interesting individual nicknames among your friends at A&M?

22:12.430 --> 22:18.120
Oh yes, we had some nicknames, but they were not mixed company.

22:24.010 --> 22:33.105
Your roommate, you and your roommate, describe the room when you all got it furnished, when you unpacked, what was in that room?

22:33.237 --> 22:40.351
Well, we had a double deck bed at a desk.

22:40.371 --> 22:42.194
He at one end, me at the other end.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.080
Bookcases that went across it.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.250
We had a small rug.

22:51.125 --> 23:01.158
that we put by the bed because when we were barefooted, you liked to get up on that rug instead of that concrete floor.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.442
And no curtains?

23:06.264 --> 23:08.287
No, I don't recall us having curtains.

23:08.447 --> 23:10.069
No fan and no radio.

23:10.730 --> 23:11.391
We had a radio.

23:11.411 --> 23:12.172
Oh, you had a radio?

23:12.272 --> 23:12.613
Yeah.

23:13.093 --> 23:14.235
Herbert had a radio.

23:14.355 --> 23:16.137
What stations did you all listen to?

23:16.285 --> 23:23.477
Uh, whatever the Bryan College Station stations were, that was about all we could get.

23:23.798 --> 23:24.539
WTAW.

23:24.879 --> 23:25.240
Yeah.

23:25.521 --> 23:26.582
Watch the Aggies win.

23:27.183 --> 23:27.504
Yeah.

23:28.746 --> 23:39.424
My family and I, our number four son and his wife, live not very far north here, and we're going down to Waxahachie tomorrow to hear the Light Crust Doughboys.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.928
From Burris Mills.

23:41.948 --> 23:42.529
Yes, sir.

23:43.009 --> 23:44.171
I've been telling them.

23:44.251 --> 23:45.353
I grew up hearing those.

23:45.814 --> 23:48.418
We're the Light Quest Door Boys from Burris Mills.

23:48.718 --> 23:52.324
With W. Leo Daniel as their emcee when he owned the Burris Mills.

23:52.344 --> 23:52.684
Right.

23:54.627 --> 23:56.310
You see, you didn't have a fan, though.

23:56.730 --> 24:01.397
Did you have a lamp, or did you just have one big light in the room?

24:02.779 --> 24:04.061
We did not have a lamp.

24:04.222 --> 24:06.525
We had light in the room.

24:07.332 --> 24:14.822
And I believe we had a, each of us had a lamp like that on our side of the desk.

24:15.082 --> 24:15.543
Okay.

24:15.563 --> 24:22.412
We had our books, bookshelf in the middle, and it divided the desk.

24:22.572 --> 24:27.519
I sat on this end, he sat on that end, and the two bookshelves were in the middle.

24:28.621 --> 24:33.247
Once classes start, describe the typical class day routine.

24:33.747 --> 24:35.249
What time did y'all get up?

24:35.330 --> 24:36.411
What did you do?

24:37.370 --> 24:39.032
until about 10 o'clock at night.

24:39.553 --> 24:40.053
All right.

24:41.695 --> 24:43.397
We got up about 5.

24:46.141 --> 25:04.643
We showered, shaved, got dressed, polished our shoes, organized our books when we had to go to class,

25:05.787 --> 25:13.856
and really put those on the corner of the desk because Hart Hall was kind of in the middle.

25:15.237 --> 25:29.353
We'd come back, try to get back at least between two classes, leave our books, pick up our new things and take off to get to class.

25:30.053 --> 25:34.258
Did you have to police an upperclassman's room when you were freshman?

25:34.745 --> 25:35.886
What do I mean, police?

25:35.906 --> 25:37.768
Did you have to go clean up an upperclassman?

25:37.788 --> 25:39.570
Oh yes, we had to do that.

25:40.831 --> 25:47.018
You had to clean up your upperclassman's room and you had the same upperclassman's room to clean up.

25:48.840 --> 25:57.049
But I had worked in the oil fields for two years before I went to, got to go to A&M.

25:58.610 --> 26:03.115
And I was not big, but I was hard.

26:04.529 --> 26:19.294
And they, I quickly learned what they, they'd have baseball bats and you know they'd shave them about that thick and I learned what the boards were.

26:20.636 --> 26:26.807
And I very early acquired the reputation.

26:28.053 --> 26:32.444
He said, D. Barry's got an iron ass freshman.

26:32.464 --> 26:44.593
And because I was, I had worked in the oil fields hard and I was hard and when I pulled a pooch

26:46.210 --> 26:48.693
It just really didn't bother me too much.

26:49.233 --> 27:01.628
And, you know, at this time they'd do warm up licks in one, two, three, and I'd turn around and say, is that all?

27:02.949 --> 27:09.236
And what was the kind of reason they would use to apply the board?

27:09.276 --> 27:10.137
What did you all do?

27:10.157 --> 27:12.640
Oh gosh.

27:13.531 --> 27:41.057
uh walking on the sidewalk instead of walking in the street or uh and I was always doing something to the upperclassmen's room and some examples of what would y'all do uh put a bucket of water on the door and uh and uh oh

27:43.231 --> 28:10.605
uh jump all his bed clothes on the floor and uh guys did y'all uh do any stunts in the middle of the night no generally we didn't we cq freshmen and sophomores required to be in their room and a senior or junior or senior would come in and inspect but would also be available

28:11.243 --> 28:14.568
to answer any questions you might have about your studies.

28:15.830 --> 28:39.647
And I was taking petroleum engineering and I knew the upperclassmen that were taking petroleum engineering and sometimes you'd request permission during CQ to go ask him something that he could tell you very quickly and was happy to do it.

28:40.741 --> 28:44.030
Now, you were in class almost all morning.

28:44.090 --> 28:47.279
Did you all come back and fall in and march to noon, child?

28:47.319 --> 28:50.127
Yes, we marched breakfast, noon, and dinner.

28:50.613 --> 28:58.700
And then in the afternoon, intramurals, was your outfit strong in intramurals?

29:00.442 --> 29:05.587
Yes, we were, we had an intramural operation.

29:06.307 --> 29:17.818
I was seldom in it because I was taking, I was originally going to get a combined ME petroleum degree.

29:18.912 --> 29:31.912
And I was, we had a full class and I was taking 18 hours of engineering and we generally had labs till five o'clock, at least three days out of the week.

29:33.854 --> 29:37.820
And you didn't, I didn't have a whole lot of free time.

29:38.161 --> 29:47.535
All right, so then you'd come back, fall out for night inspection, go to night chow, then go, then would you come back to your room and study?

29:47.633 --> 29:57.513
Yes, but what we'd do, we'd come back and have a drill from five to, we'd drill because we were going to be in competition drill.

29:58.676 --> 30:02.524
And the whole outfit would drill, the freshmen up to seniors.

30:03.065 --> 30:03.946
Where did y'all drill?

30:04.708 --> 30:06.472
In the street in front of Hart Hall.

30:06.572 --> 30:06.672
Okay.

30:07.934 --> 30:13.220
and you said that you were acquainted with your outfit commander.

30:14.060 --> 30:18.165
Did you make some other important friendships that first year at A&M?

30:18.185 --> 30:18.785
Oh, yes.

30:19.066 --> 30:35.443
Yeah, your buddy across the shower and the toilet were between the rooms, and those were all your close friends that you could see them.

30:37.499 --> 30:43.966
My sister had been very popular, and all the Highland Park guys knew I was Betty's little brother.

30:44.767 --> 31:04.047
And not only in my outfit, but in other outfits, they knew I was there, and it was very helpful to me to get to know other people other than D Battery Coast.

31:04.921 --> 31:08.868
What were some of the courses that you remember that first year, that first semester?

31:10.792 --> 31:13.496
Oh, I don't really remember many of my first semester.

31:13.597 --> 31:23.875
I do remember my junior and senior years, the courses and the particular professors you had.
