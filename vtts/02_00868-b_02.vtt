WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:11.134
Mentioning people, and I'll start with 
mentioning people in the planning department

00:01.803 --> 00:11.134
that have made some contributions over the years. 
And I'll just, currently Mike O'Neill is the head

00:13.036 --> 00:20.545
of current planning at the planning department. 
And Mike worked a lot on the land use plan and many of

00:20.565 --> 00:30.257
the changes in the land use regulations San 
Antonio has received some credit for,

00:30.912 --> 00:39.180
particularly dealing with issues of affordable 
housing and other things. So he's certainly

00:39.200 --> 00:45.106
someone that has and is making a contribution 
today. Oh,

00:46.027 --> 00:50.271
I'm bad at names.

00:56.357 --> 00:56.717
Well. Wendell Davis, who is no longer with the 
planning department, and he's got his own firm,

00:57.153 --> 01:24.848
Wendell Davis and Associates, and also a firm 
called Essay Research, both in San Antonio, was

00:57.153 --> 01:24.848
kind of the principal planner during the period of 
the chapter four and all of that era, and worked on a

00:57.153 --> 01:24.848
lot of it, and didn't necessarily support some of 
the things that the planning department was doing

01:25.503 --> 01:34.877
and probably be a good person to talk to about many 
of the things that went on. He also worked closely

01:34.897 --> 01:45.512
with, during this period of time, the city was 
attempting to get some feel for the cost of growth,

01:34.897 --> 01:45.512
because that was also an issue. So Gruen and Gruen 
and Newport Economic Group and others were

01:46.113 --> 01:52.622
retained as consultants. And many of those 
studies I think are significant in terms of the

01:55.928 --> 02:02.516
evolution of the planning department itself.

02:14.751 --> 02:22.020
God, thinking back, it's hard to remember all 
those people over the years and what they

02:26.354 --> 02:38.666
Probably the way to do this systematically is the 
biography or the bibliography I gave you has got

02:26.354 --> 02:38.666
most of the documents listed. We'd really have to 
go in and look at who were the, because most of those

02:38.686 --> 02:49.938
documents list the staff and who was the key staff 
person involved in some of those things. As I

02:49.958 --> 02:55.163
mentioned, Stromberg earlier is one of the main 
people behind the whole gross sketch and gross

02:55.919 --> 02:57.722
study. Drumber moved on to Colorado. Yeah, last I 
knew he was in some city suburb of Denver, but that

03:01.327 --> 03:09.879
was a number of years ago. I don't know where

03:09.899 --> 03:14.666
he ended up. Yeah, well I do want to make sure that 
the principal and senior planners who made

03:14.686 --> 03:23.378
impacts on city planning in the various cities of 
Texas, as well as just the planning directors and

03:23.780 --> 03:39.297
mayors.

03:42.400 --> 03:53.652
Now, considering the whole panorama of planning 
in San Antonio, what do you consider to be the five

03:42.400 --> 03:53.652
or so major planning events in San Antonio's 
history?

04:02.812 --> 04:19.855
Well,

04:02.812 --> 04:19.855
I'm not sure that these would classify as events.

04:24.802 --> 04:30.810
Well, if you're looking at it in an objective sort 
of way, I'd have to say that the Bartholomew plan

04:32.309 --> 04:39.638
its adoption was certainly significant.

04:39.959 --> 04:57.220
Obviously, extremely significant was the 
adoption of the charter with that very strong

04:39.959 --> 04:57.220
pro-planning Article 9, which is probably as 
strong a mandate as any city has in Texas, given the

04:57.875 --> 05:02.302
fact that state statute is silent. I think the 
splitting of the Planning and Zoning Commission

05:03.484 --> 05:19.971
in 1976 to really start the whole movement toward a 
plan was also a significant event. I think the

05:20.171 --> 05:23.697
adoption of the basic plan which not the event 
itself in August of 1980 as much as what it

05:25.027 --> 05:53.397
represented in the community and that was that the 
community over a period of three or four years had

05:25.027 --> 05:53.397
turned around from a position where there was a lot 
of disagreement about the legitimacy of a city

05:25.027 --> 05:53.397
doing planning to more recently almost near 
unanimity about the role of a city in dealing with

05:53.815 --> 05:59.182
growth and development through a plan. I think 
when you see a new chairman of the Greater San

05:59.282 --> 06:19.688
Antonio Chamber of Commerce take office and one of 
his opening statements is, you know, pro-City of

05:59.282 --> 06:19.688
San Antonio doing planning, you know things have 
really started turning around. the adoption of

06:20.107 --> 06:26.575
the Basic Plan kind of symbolized that type of 
thing. Another event I think is just the

06:27.717 --> 06:47.582
appointment of Ed Davis as Director of Planning 
and his influence, although even today it may be

06:27.717 --> 06:47.582
hard to judge what that influence actually is, but 
I do think that that represented a substantial

06:48.068 --> 06:57.040
change in terms of the professional staff and 
professionalism in city planning in San Antonio.

06:57.601 --> 07:01.826
So those are some things that I think are 
significant. Has state government had any

07:01.846 --> 07:09.296
appreciable impact on planning in San Antonio? 
Well, only in terms of events, not in terms of... of

07:17.819 --> 07:26.034
providing technical assistance or providing 
specific legislative abilities. What I mean by

07:26.415 --> 07:37.836
events are things like, and I'm sure Kathy Powell 
talked with you about this, but the whole aquifer

07:26.415 --> 07:37.836
controversy. that in San Antonio basically 
focused on the period about 1975 through 1979. And

07:46.347 --> 07:54.118
the state had a role in that basically because of 
the Texas Water Quality Board and all that. And we

07:54.999 --> 08:03.571
see the state dealing with events as opposed to 
anything else in plain in San Antonio. And then, of

08:03.591 --> 08:06.996
course, the location of the university campus. 
But

08:07.432 --> 08:25.997
see, most of San Antonio's planning, since we 
lacked a plan until relatively recently, has been

08:07.432 --> 08:25.997
a reactive type of thing. You know, there have been 
major controversies, and it's not just, you know,

08:26.218 --> 08:35.430
everything from urban renewal controversies 
with the San Antonio new town in town, in the early

08:35.950 --> 08:52.572
1970s, to things like the aquifer in the mid-70s, 
to San Antonio Ranch Newtown, and they just go on

08:35.950 --> 08:52.572
and on and on, and still to a certain extent go on 
over specific projects. Well, and then of course

08:52.993 --> 09:04.168
one would have to ask the state's impact on 
planning in San Antonio regarding the location of

08:52.993 --> 09:04.168
freeways.

09:06.832 --> 09:16.704
Well, except that most of the... Well, I guess I'd 
say two things. A, is that the freeway thing has

09:16.944 --> 09:22.711
been a positive impact overall. And B, is that 
lately, the last decade or two, it's been a

09:22.731 --> 09:30.561
cooperative effort. In other words, the state has 
not come in and said, here's the way it's going to

09:30.661 --> 09:35.106
be. In fact, I think at San Antonio our expressway 
system is as good, and I think better, than any that

09:35.873 --> 09:51.651
exists in the state of Texas, and probably as good 
as any in the country. And that came about because

09:52.232 --> 09:59.079
of cooperation, not the state mandating that this 
is the way it's going to be. And that's evidenced by

09:59.159 --> 10:04.986
some of the things that are going on with 
expressways now in San Antonio. Now, even the

10:05.236 --> 10:09.162
state is not in the role as the initiator. It's the 
local community. You would say that the history of

10:12.747 --> 10:21.560
freeway location has largely been a cooperative 
effort in San Antonio. I think it has, and I think

10:21.580 --> 10:27.810
that obviously there are problems. I mean, you 
know, roads were located that created problems in

10:31.747 --> 10:36.232
terms of certain specific neighborhoods. But in 
the era of the urban expressway in this country, I

10:36.912 --> 10:45.421
challenge anyone to name a city in which that 
didn't occur. The overall system,

10:46.222 --> 10:54.170
where it's located and how it functions today I 
think is good. And I think that the community has

10:54.890 --> 11:00.336
resisted, and there are examples of this, has 
resisted expressways. In other words, not every

11:02.365 --> 11:05.929
expressway that was proposed got built. There 
were big controversies over the Bandera

11:06.449 --> 11:09.993
Expressway. There were major controversies over 
the Macalester Expressway. So I mean, it's not

11:13.457 --> 11:16.480
like they haven't been controversial. In fact, 
the Macalester Expressway is an indication of 20

11:16.500 --> 11:25.750
or 25 years classic example of a controversy. But 
there, the controversy was not necessarily the

11:26.050 --> 11:30.475
state against the city. But it was various 
factions in the city fighting over it. I think the

11:35.784 --> 11:41.332
state

11:35.784 --> 11:41.332
role is a positive role.

11:44.636 --> 11:57.512
What are the main administrative procedures and 
planning program elements that San Antonio has

11:44.636 --> 11:57.512
for implementing community plans? You've 
already mentioned, of course, the usual.

11:59.834 --> 12:01.697
subdivision review and so on. And basically 
that's what they are. I mean, you've got the

12:04.140 --> 12:13.254
traditional mechanisms of San Antonio, zoning, 
subdivision, capital improvements, codes, and

12:04.140 --> 12:13.254
then a lot of projects. I think the San Antonio has 
been on the cutting edge in terms of working

12:13.274 --> 12:22.348
cooperatively with the private sector to get 
things done. We see For example, downtown San

12:25.552 --> 12:40.589
Antonio, which was a high priority and has been in 
most of the plans, its rejuvenation was due

12:25.552 --> 12:40.589
largely to the city's leadership and cooperation 
with the private sector. San Antonio has also, I

12:40.609 --> 12:48.798
think, largely been on the cutting edge in looking 
at new mechanisms. You know, talk about historic

12:49.539 --> 12:53.263
districts or talk about airport military airport 
zoning or talk about tax assessment districts or

12:53.581 --> 13:23.385
tax increment financing or all these types of 
things San Antonio has I think at least in Texas

12:53.581 --> 13:23.385
been on the cutting edge of either using those 
mechanisms or being the one that really pushed the

12:53.581 --> 13:23.385
state to allow cities to get them and then they're 
using them once the state has got them it's also

12:53.581 --> 13:23.385
worked very cooperatively with the federal 
government to get things done, the creation of the

13:23.652 --> 13:45.624
San Antonio Missions National Historic Park, the 
protection of the military airport in San

13:23.652 --> 13:45.624
Antonio, a lot of flood control projects, and the 
cooperative things between the city of San

13:23.652 --> 13:45.624
Antonio, the San Antonio River Authority, and the 
Army Corps of Engineers. So I think San Antonio's

13:46.245 --> 13:53.035
gone a long way beyond the traditional 
mechanisms. And these administrative

13:53.352 --> 13:57.817
procedures are certainly not all within the 
planning department. Oh, no. In fact, when it

13:58.577 --> 14:07.226
comes to plan implementation, a lot of that occurs 
outside the planning department. And in fact,

14:07.286 --> 14:20.600
see, the other thing you've got to realize is that 
it's only relatively recently that even the

14:07.286 --> 14:20.600
common planning implementing mechanisms have 
been within the planning department. For a long

14:20.620 --> 14:22.482
time, zoning was not a function that the planning 
department dealt with. That was in a separate

14:28.235 --> 14:31.820
department of the city. I recall that was that way, 
and Lila Conkroll was concerned about that

14:31.880 --> 14:39.370
relationship. Yeah. So actually, for a long time, 
we really had two planning departments, in

14:41.773 --> 14:48.923
essence. We had a planning department, and let me 
just say that that these came about because of the

14:55.098 --> 15:04.029
politics of the bureaucracy, as well as some 
structural problems. One of the reasons,

15:04.490 --> 15:24.936
well let me just back up and say that for a long time 
we had two planning departments, one that dealt

15:04.490 --> 15:24.936
with long range planning, and then one that 
basically could be characterized as current

15:04.490 --> 15:24.936
planning, where zoning and all of those types of 
things would be. And they didn't really even get

15:29.068 --> 15:33.655
along with each other very well. Were they housed 
in the same office? Not even the same building.

15:40.344 --> 15:41.526
They had different directors.

15:44.290 --> 15:44.851
Okay. We've talked a lot about San Antonio and its 
planning. That's the topic. Now we have come to the

15:51.621 --> 15:54.805
point that San Antonio has a mayor who has a degree 
in planning. And as such,

16:01.371 --> 16:09.580
has this made a difference in San Antonio? Or if 
not, do you think it might in the future? And in what

16:14.846 --> 16:23.695
way is Henry Cisneros' mayorship going to be 
significantly different than anyone else's?

16:26.797 --> 16:30.080
Well, I'm not sure it's made a difference. Let me 
say that I guess Henry had the opportunities that

16:32.602 --> 16:46.676
Hartman had to initiate and be very supportive of 
the planning function in San Antonio. And I think

16:47.596 --> 16:56.685
that his overall record is one of cautious and

17:02.183 --> 17:12.318
Well, cautious support, but it's also 
characterized by periods where frequently he'll

17:02.183 --> 17:12.318
just ignore the planning function. Henry is the 
type of person that's much more oriented to

17:13.260 --> 17:31.127
projects and getting things done as opposed to the 
long-range planning type of effort that we're

17:13.260 --> 17:31.127
talking about. And he was not the one that was 
responsible for the mid-'70s planning

17:31.715 --> 17:41.892
initiative, although he was supportive of it. 
More recently, his Target 90 effort is an example

17:41.912 --> 17:56.777
of something that, although one could attribute 
that to his planning education, that we need

17:41.912 --> 17:56.777
goals, The whole thing was done totally outside of 
and largely ignored the established planning

17:57.263 --> 18:04.134
function. What he did was ended up almost going 
back to turn of the century planning in the United

18:04.154 --> 18:21.381
States and appointing a massive 500 person 
private citizen committee to come up with Now,

18:21.597 --> 18:33.571
there were many beneficial things about that 
process, but I'm not sure that in terms of typical

18:21.597 --> 18:33.571
planning, that that's such a good idea. Because 
you have in place, I mean, it wasn't that the city

18:33.752 --> 18:39.278
didn't have goals. The city's got goals coming out 
the kazoo. It's just that this was a separate type

18:42.162 --> 18:51.553
of effort, and it remains to be seen whether the 
target 90 ongoing process actually accomplishes

18:51.955 --> 19:00.144
anything since frequently it's operating 
outside the planning structure that the city has

18:51.955 --> 19:00.144
established. And that's characteristic of how 
Henry is operating. He knows planning, but he's

19:04.590 --> 19:08.995
not interested in long-range stuff. He's 
interested in getting stuff done, the project

19:09.015 --> 19:12.879
stuff. Well, some people would argue that the 
institutionalized planning process of local

19:17.521 --> 19:23.868
government is outside the realm of the 
decision-making process. I would agree. I'm even

19:26.512 --> 19:31.998
questioning the need for it.

19:32.098 --> 19:42.330
We've had two other examples of goals, projects 
for major Texas cities, one in Corpus Christi and

19:32.098 --> 19:42.330
another in Dallas. Well, don't forget Austin. And 
Austin had one as a basis for their Austin Tomorrow

19:44.809 --> 19:50.456
plan, so-called. And then, of course, the state of 
Texas as well. And

19:54.901 --> 20:07.417
what has come of these goals programs is variable. 
The one in Corpus Christi was an excellent

20:07.437 --> 20:11.001
program. Unfortunately, it came to very little in 
their case. Do you have a copy of the book? Yes. The

20:21.378 --> 20:37.997
goals for Texas, I think the fallout from that, I'm 
sorry, the goals for Dallas are going to be longer

20:21.378 --> 20:37.997
coming because of the politics of the Dallas 
situation. But we'll have to see Marvin

20:38.017 --> 20:41.241
Springer's writings. about that now. And the 
goals for Texas, we know what happened to that.

20:51.472 --> 20:54.316
And Austin is mixed. It's mixed. And they have yet 
to produce a full-blown plan. All they have now

21:00.944 --> 21:07.392
is... Well, but their whole attitude has changed 
in terms of growth. It really has. And they have yet

21:08.896 --> 21:11.099
to produce... Which is exactly what happened in 
San Antonio. San Antonio's attitude changed

21:13.201 --> 21:16.405
about growth. I was going to say, Austin has yet to 
produce a full-blown plan. They have the makings

21:21.231 --> 21:24.195
of a plan, but it's not a complete plan. All it is is a 
word plan filled with goals and objectives and

21:25.176 --> 21:32.124
policy statements. And that was unsatisfactory 
for the council. Well, but I'll also argue is that

21:38.140 --> 21:43.566
is that the definition of what constitutes a plan 
or what works as a plan is changing. And I'm not sure

21:43.606 --> 21:47.951
that... See, San Antonio doesn't have a picture 
plan. And I'm not sure that, you know... In many

21:53.177 --> 21:57.362
cases, a community can find a policies plan that 
works just as well. I would argue that. Well, I know

21:59.524 --> 22:00.305
you would. I'm just saying that's the reality of 
many communities today. Well, they're planning

22:04.634 --> 22:08.317
that that reality doesn't work in the case of 
Austin. It's a good example. Well, I don't think

22:09.798 --> 22:25.652
you can attribute that in Austin to the plan itself 
as much as you can attribute it to some incredible

22:09.798 --> 22:25.652
changes in terms of the politics. Just like San 
Antonio, the political and the social and the

22:26.333 --> 22:33.679
economic environment of that community has 
changed so much. and their attitudes about the

22:34.098 --> 22:46.010
role of local government and their ideas of growth 
have just changed. And in Austin's case, they're

22:46.290 --> 22:49.693
still going through some evolutionary things. 
Like today, it'll be interesting to see in Austin

22:49.713 --> 23:03.447
what happens with some elections, because 
there's some very clear-cut council races in

22:49.713 --> 23:03.447
Austin that revolve on those basic issues that 
have been around since Friedman's day.

23:09.430 --> 23:16.486
I

23:09.430 --> 23:16.486
have a question here regarding the use of 
consultants. What has been the role of private

23:17.127 --> 23:23.882
planning consultants in San Antonio's various 
planning programs? Well, over the years, in

23:25.398 --> 23:44.609
addition to assistance on the major planning 
efforts, San Antonio has used literally probably

23:25.398 --> 23:44.609
hundreds of consultants on specific types of 
planning projects.

23:49.096 --> 23:53.042
SOM worked with the city on the major River 
Corridor Study, the award-winning study. The

23:58.455 --> 24:06.329
cities have used consultants more recently like 
Metcalf and Eddy out of Boston to work on the

23:58.455 --> 24:06.329
aquifer study. It's used Gruen and Gruen out of 
California on its economic analysis. It's used

24:13.373 --> 24:24.585
Ross Hardies, O'Keeffe, Babcock, and Parsons out 
of Chicago, the big land use law firm, to work on the

24:13.373 --> 24:24.585
city's development code. So there literally have 
been countless examples of consultants dealing

24:25.125 --> 24:40.241
with the city, both in terms of specific projects 
where it's designed, as well as development codes

24:25.125 --> 24:40.241
and things like that. And San Antonio doesn't 
hesitate to bring in. More recently it was using

24:44.894 --> 24:52.784
Lane Kendig who wrote the book on performance 
zoning to come in and do some things. So, you know,

24:52.824 --> 25:00.894
San Antonio has constantly used planning 
consultants. Not so much the firm to come in and do a

25:01.014 --> 25:07.242
plan as much as firms that have a particular 
expertise in the law or in zoning or in economics or

25:07.745 --> 25:25.922
in something else to come in and work with the 
planning department staff on a specific project

25:07.745 --> 25:25.922
or a plan element.
