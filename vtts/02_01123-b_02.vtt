WEBVTT

00:01.094 --> 00:15.789
is that George, in my judgment, is one of the truly 
unusual captains of industry in our country,

00:01.094 --> 00:15.789
indeed in the world. He has an intellectual 
curiosity that's refreshing. He's not just

00:21.274 --> 00:23.997
focused on the business. He's really interested 
in a broad spectrum of human life. He's

00:30.322 --> 00:35.790
incredibly bright. He's got a memory like a steel 
trap. And I really have grown to love him and

00:38.794 --> 00:46.444
respect him because of that. He's a humanist. He 
has an interest in the globe. He's unusual. And

00:52.473 --> 00:54.135
it's not well known. He's not perceived that way. 
No, not the outside. Inside, yes. We get this

00:59.025 --> 01:02.228
pretty consistently. The guy's brutally honest

01:02.248 --> 01:13.338
with himself and with everybody else. So in that 
sense, you would not be surprised. Thank you,

01:18.303 --> 01:18.743
Donna. You're welcome. You would not be surprised 
once you know this about him. That he does these

01:24.895 --> 01:26.017
things. That he would be interested in such a 
project. Good. And not be daunted by the

01:29.884 --> 01:35.513
challenge. That's another side of the George 
Mitchell story. Yeah. That's pretty impressive.

01:40.662 --> 01:41.543
Yeah, you bet. A

01:42.926 --> 01:48.355
person who's become A good friend of mine over, 
since I've been at HAARC, is from Switzerland

01:48.875 --> 01:54.160
named Luke Tissot. And Luke and I spend a fair 
amount of time talking about this cultural

01:54.340 --> 02:01.226
difference between our sectors of society. And 
this trip to Eastern Europe a couple weeks ago, we

02:02.428 --> 02:08.093
were together. We spoke of this again. And

02:09.794 --> 02:15.760
I'm reminded of our discussion at this point about 
George is that in the academic world, when you're

02:16.567 --> 02:29.662
sitting around and having a collegial 
discussion, the important thing is to have a good

02:16.567 --> 02:29.662
problem.

02:33.026 --> 02:35.328
And what people want to know is, what's your 
problem? What are you working on? What are you

02:36.249 --> 02:37.571
trying to solve? But the focus is on the problem. 
That's right. And in the business world, You are a

02:45.794 --> 02:48.037
deliverer of good solutions. And in the academic 
world, you're a deliverer of good problems. And it

02:54.504 --> 02:58.910
really is clean, and it really clarifies it. And 
people that can do both are rare, rare, rare.

03:05.077 --> 03:10.063
Because the worst thing to have happen in the 
academic world is to come up with an elegant

03:10.634 --> 03:16.199
solution that destroys your problem. 
Particularly if it's worth money. That's why more

03:17.460 --> 03:21.343
study is needed, isn't it? I mean, if you make money 
doing it, I mean, you're really screwed up. That's

03:24.966 --> 03:25.567
right. So then you look like one of them instead of 
one of us. And the economic feeding chain is not

03:30.030 --> 03:40.219
well understood, or not even interested, 
typically, in being understood in our

03:30.030 --> 03:40.219
traditional academic world, and that has to 
change. And it is changing. And if we can lead the

03:45.994 --> 04:00.188
change, rather than wait until economic reality 
forces the change, we can anticipate and initiate

03:45.994 --> 04:00.188
to cause it before it hits us and forces it. See, our 
government's out of control. I mean, it's

04:03.211 --> 04:05.914
embarrassing to be from this country right now. 
And these guys in our congressional

04:10.591 --> 04:13.434
representatives in both the Senate and the House. 
They just can't believe the reality of where they

04:13.454 --> 04:15.696
are. And hence, they can't deal with it. They 
cannot deal with it. And finally, it'll get dealt

04:20.680 --> 04:27.026
with by the laws of Mother Nature, not through 
leadership. Who was it that said, change happens

04:27.046 --> 04:32.812
in a democracy by two ways, leadership, crisis, 
and mostly by crisis? But see, George would take

04:35.174 --> 04:38.297
this challenge on. Yeah. as an interesting 
problem that needs a solution, let's go get the

04:40.072 --> 04:43.116
solution. And he just goes after the solution. And 
indeed, in fact, the whole concept of it seems to be

04:45.079 --> 04:52.050
the idea that he is going to manage change over a 
very long period. You bet. And he's creating a town

04:52.751 --> 04:55.475
here. It's a vision. This isn't a real estate 
project. He's creating a town.

05:05.369 --> 05:07.072
So let's put the super glider back into that. Yeah, 
so the super glider was project that at an

05:10.970 --> 05:36.302
executive committee meeting of Hark's board on 
which I served I said okay

05:10.970 --> 05:36.302
this is a project which is arisen on the campus of 
Texas A&M as an official of that institution

05:10.970 --> 05:36.302
I'm empowered to commit that institution, 
backing fully for this institution, to take the

05:37.092 --> 05:43.639
lead. And I commit to HARC that Texas A&M will do 
whatever it can to back HARC's lead in taking on the

05:43.659 --> 05:59.256
proposal for the super plan. And the executive 
committee voted that that was a good project for

05:59.276 --> 06:05.142
HARC to do. took it on and I went back and at the next 
executive committee meeting at A&M, I said, by the

06:05.594 --> 06:11.520
way, I could tell you what I did. And everybody 
said, wonderful Porter, that's why we put you on

06:12.261 --> 06:15.264
the board. You know? So, uh, I said, well, we're 
committed. Everybody said, great. Just tell us

06:22.091 --> 06:23.513
what we need to do next. And so we created then in the 
fall, in the spring of 1984 to get us back in the time

06:23.613 --> 06:33.643
and to get me here, which is where you want to go. the 
Texas Accelerator Center as an arm of PARCC. OK.

06:42.796 --> 06:47.003
That is now before? Before I come.

06:51.649 --> 06:54.253
I think that's March of 84.

06:57.398 --> 06:58.540
And about that time. So right now, PARCC is an 
entity. And HARC, and you're on the board, and HARC

07:01.923 --> 07:10.436
is looking at a super collider, a super computer, 
and the Texas Accelerator Center. Well, the Texas

07:10.456 --> 07:14.723
Accelerator Center and the super collider are one 
and the same project. The Texas Accelerator

07:16.325 --> 07:20.832
Center is the formal mechanism to pursue the super 
collider. And so HARC agrees to commit $1.6

07:21.773 --> 07:29.365
million to support the establishment of the Texas 
Accelerator Center at HARC. And where is that

07:32.672 --> 07:35.456
money coming from? It's coming from the 
endowment, or not endowment, but the budgetary

07:35.537 --> 07:42.787
commitment to HARC from George. Is there any 
university money in that pot? None. Not in that

07:46.473 --> 07:48.115
$1.6 million. Now, several of the universities 
also committed financial support to the team. And

07:55.807 --> 07:58.491
I think Texas A&M ended up with In the final 
analysis, I don't know when you say final

07:59.568 --> 08:15.149
analysis, but over the period of a few years after I 
did come, it was something like a million dollars

07:59.568 --> 08:15.149
total when HAARC had maybe five million total in 
it. So now the accelerator center is launched. The

08:21.678 --> 08:29.068
supercomputer proposal is in preparation and 
being submitted. And the laser center, Doctors

08:29.504 --> 08:49.909
Margrave and Barry from Rice, have an opportunity 
to go after a contract that is classified, or could

08:29.504 --> 08:49.909
be classified, when it is not permitted on Rice 
University's campus. As HARC is an outlet for

08:50.817 --> 09:00.306
faculty that wants to do proprietary and 
classified research, they turn to HARC to say,

08:50.817 --> 09:00.306
gee, can we move this to HARC. Which is the purpose 
of HARC. That's right. And so the Laser

09:02.108 --> 09:09.735
Applications Research Center, or what would 
become the Laser Applications Research Center,

09:02.108 --> 09:09.735
begins. This is also in 84. So at this point in time, 
HARCs begin to have some things. The executive

09:18.982 --> 09:28.590
committee says, oh, and also we have a big glitch 
with Harvey McMains, who turns out to claim to be

09:18.982 --> 09:28.590
several things he wasn't. There's a big 
embarrassment, and he's invited to leave. And so

09:32.393 --> 09:43.903
he leaves, and

09:32.393 --> 09:43.903
the board decides, boy, there's some things that 
look like could really begin here. We need to get

09:44.003 --> 09:48.887
some, sure enough, leadership full time. Hydric

09:49.593 --> 09:53.778
and Struggles is hired. Who is that? Hydric and 
Struggles, executive search firm. They're hired

10:01.347 --> 10:09.337
to do a search

10:01.347 --> 10:09.337
to find a president. And George comes to me and 
says, I'd like to nominate you to become the

10:09.357 --> 10:17.187
president of Harvard.

10:20.457 --> 10:31.132
And this is in the

10:20.457 --> 10:31.132
summer of 84.

10:35.297 --> 10:49.857
And

10:35.297 --> 10:49.857
he says, following that, or maybe at that time, 
that he's talked, or he will talk, or he wants to

10:35.297 --> 10:49.857
talk. to Hanson and Vandiver to be sure this is 
comfortable with him, for him to even do this, that

10:50.731 --> 11:05.634
he doesn't want to make them mad about recruiting 
somebody away from there, et cetera, et cetera.

11:05.654 --> 11:11.383
And I'll tell him, I'm not sure I'm interested in 
the job, but I'll think about it. Because I've been

11:11.804 --> 11:14.849
through this a couple times now in my life. So 
that's when I really sit down and, reflect on what

11:21.629 --> 11:25.094
I've already just finished telling you about the 
history of A&M. And so I'll talk to George some more

11:25.815 --> 11:33.186
about really what his view is. And this is where I 
begin to get this vision myself. Damn, I think

11:37.533 --> 11:50.893
maybe Mitchell from the industry sector of our 
society has been having the same kind of feelings

11:37.533 --> 11:50.893
and visions of what's needed that I've been having 
over here in the higher education sector. and that

11:51.228 --> 11:55.073
there might be a coming together out here. So we 
talked some more, and

11:56.755 --> 12:20.728
I went off to Scotland for a week to really think 
about it, and decided that, well, I didn't have

11:56.755 --> 12:20.728
anything to lose to agree to look at it. So I agreed 
to be a candidate. And so then they did a nationwide

12:25.443 --> 12:30.069
search. And when the smoke cleared, I got offered 
the job.

12:41.023 --> 12:42.104
Which was? Which was what's interesting, because 
there was going to be a meeting of the full board of

12:42.124 --> 12:50.074
HART in November of 84. And George wanted my answer 
by the first of November, so he could have all of

12:55.444 --> 13:10.760
this officially formally ratified at that board 
meeting and have the board there to meet me. See,

13:12.582 --> 13:14.264
I'd never met the board. The telephone board, 
you've never met the board? No, yeah, I mean there

13:15.965 --> 13:20.550
was George and myself and John Margrave from Rice 
and David Gottlieb from U of H, and I don't even

13:21.205 --> 13:28.594
believe we had anybody from UT at that time. Maybe 
Jerry Funkin was coming on. And a guy named

13:31.839 --> 13:40.570
Mitchell. Gee, I don't know why I can't think of his 
name right now. Colson Tuff. And Colson was

13:44.334 --> 13:48.059
actually on the board. And that was the executive 
committee. And during this period of time, David

13:51.158 --> 14:04.112
Gottlieb stepped in as interim president or 
acting president because McBain's had left and

13:51.158 --> 14:04.112
the search was on. So George and I got together 
downtown, I remember, in his office finally in

14:04.132 --> 14:13.643
late October and finally hammered out the 
agreement on me coming here. And I agreed and then I

14:15.064 --> 14:20.170
came down for the meeting in November and began on 
like a day a week to transition from College

14:20.808 --> 14:29.036
Station to here in November and December. And then 
I moved here January 1st, 1985. And

14:32.660 --> 14:44.091
Biddy stayed in College Station because Paige was 
a senior in high school. So she was there through

14:44.111 --> 14:45.792
the summer. I lived here in just the apartment for 
the first six months. which worked out to be great

14:52.094 --> 14:56.059
because that's all I did was work. Because HARC was 
an office in a rental building with a secretary

14:57.361 --> 15:07.975
down on Grover's Mill, the accelerator center was 
coming together. It had been operational some six

15:08.796 --> 15:13.542
or nine months at that point in time. The team was 
assembling and equipment was coming in. Things

15:16.767 --> 15:17.848
were being set up. We've been successful in 
receiving a $4 million contract from DOE to do

15:18.638 --> 15:25.566
magnet design. I

15:25.586 --> 15:35.857
showed up here in January on

15:25.586 --> 15:35.857
a full-time basis. And you were in. Pretty much. 
You and your secretary. I was in. We had that

15:40.583 --> 15:43.566
contract.

15:45.267 --> 15:46.689
I mean, there really hadn't been any leadership. 
Nobody knew how to run such an institution or

15:46.729 --> 15:49.333
organization. We had a $4 million contract from 
DOE. Books had been kept on the back of envelopes.

15:55.703 --> 15:57.746
We had an audit, DOE audit, coming up.

16:01.231 --> 16:02.032
It was a mess. I mean, a big time mess. And 
fortunately, most of,

16:05.918 --> 16:11.967
within the next

16:14.647 --> 16:25.799
12 months, most of a rather excellent team that I 
had managed to put together for the engineering

16:14.647 --> 16:25.799
experiment station. So one by one came down here 
and said, gee, you've got a job. And most of them are

16:31.845 --> 16:34.708
here. And so HART got a real leveraged management 
structure benefit by the fact that the team that

16:45.359 --> 16:53.930
had been building the Engineering Experiment 
Station wanted to do this very risky thing down

16:45.359 --> 16:53.930
here. And you're doing basically the same things 
you were doing at Texas A&M, but you're in the

16:55.532 --> 17:03.281
private sector. Or is that a fair? Yeah, I think 
that's fair. You're working with the same

17:08.448 --> 17:10.029
structures. You work in academia, state 
government. in the private industry, but now

17:13.102 --> 17:15.806
you're working in this industry? From the private 
sector side. And my extrapolation that I

17:19.311 --> 17:29.867
mentioned earlier, that private makes a 
difference, does. It's a breath of fresh air.

17:35.535 --> 17:41.404
There's almost a self-imposed cloak of concern 
about the public, protecting the public. I mean,

17:46.331 --> 17:47.752
there really is an importance. There's a 
fiduciary responsibility there

17:47.772 --> 17:55.860
that I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's real.

18:01.045 --> 18:07.712
But at heart, I'm doing this now not to say that this 
last five years hasn't been really interesting.

18:07.962 --> 18:17.175
I've probably learned more in the last five years 
than I've learned in the previous 50 or 40 or

18:07.962 --> 18:17.175
whatever it is. But at any rate, dealing with four 
institutions now instead of one.

18:28.851 --> 18:35.961
Is it more now that you're cooperating with them as 
volunteer organizations out there? Well, as

18:36.700 --> 18:42.949
associates, what kind of relationship do you 
describe? OK, it's matured and it's evolved,

18:42.969 --> 18:47.335
both. Initially, HARC was owned by the four 
founders, which at that point in time were the

18:48.577 --> 18:57.990
four.

19:01.395 --> 19:04.800
HARC had a 29-member board, four board members 
from each of the four founding institutions

19:05.202 --> 19:16.299
formed 16 members of this 29, and then the others 
were pretty much elected.

19:18.162 --> 19:30.822
In most cases,

19:18.162 --> 19:30.822
many if not most, these were faculty members that 
never served on a board of anything, certainly a

19:18.162 --> 19:30.822
corporate board, an institutional board. So 
you're really in the same situation in a way,

19:31.207 --> 19:38.837
mentally, that you left Texas A&M? In some ways, 
the board members are there more to protect the

19:38.857 --> 19:48.329
interest of their home institutions as opposed to 
build a new one, which you could understand.

19:50.993 --> 19:53.316
And with a culture of...

19:55.928 --> 19:58.693
Their institution is the most important thing. It 
was intriguing and interesting to come to these

19:58.753 --> 20:04.162
meetings because they could see and watch their 
colleagues from other institutions. But coming

20:05.223 --> 20:21.210
to HARC with a HARC hat to build HARC as a board 
member with fiduciary board member

20:05.223 --> 20:21.210
responsibilities responsible to the publics 
that support HARC isn't even in the mental

20:21.764 --> 20:23.326
perspective of most of these people. They don't 
have a perspective of what that means. And they're

20:27.150 --> 20:29.011
even collaborating, working at it before anyway. 
Well, but never certainly been on the board of a

20:29.152 --> 20:38.301
non-profit institution where you have a 
fiduciary responsibility to the public that

20:29.152 --> 20:38.301
supports it.

20:42.285 --> 20:50.033
And also,

20:42.285 --> 20:50.033
that structure began to create

20:53.827 --> 21:23.260
particularly, I think, for the University of 
Texas and Texas A&M, who

20:53.827 --> 21:23.260
perceive themselves as big enough to do anything 
alone,

20:53.827 --> 21:23.260
almost always, that if HARC, with one of the other 
institutions, went after a contract that they

21:24.269 --> 21:28.273
wanted to go after individually. There was the 
opportunity for the contractor

21:29.975 --> 21:49.095
to come to the conclusion that if they funded HARC, 
they would be funding the other institution

21:29.975 --> 21:49.095
anyway, since the other institution owned HARC.

21:51.674 --> 21:58.002
which put them in the awkward and uncomfortable 
position of kind of competing with themselves.

21:59.204 --> 22:00.365
And very understandable. And so Bill Cunningham 
in particular got uncomfortable about that,

22:02.528 --> 22:13.582
which I understood and concurred with. And until 
Hark was Hark, not the sibling or the slave, so to

22:23.399 --> 22:26.283
speak.

22:31.952 --> 22:48.597
So until HARC was HARC, as really an independent 
institution, that these collaborative

22:31.952 --> 22:48.597
institutions could on their own initiative, when 
they wanted to, when they felt it was to their

22:31.952 --> 22:48.597
benefit, decide to come when we requested or when 
they requested and said, hey, let's do this deal

22:49.488 --> 22:53.553
together. And when they didn't, they didn't. And 
it was just clean. And we could get a smaller board

23:00.421 --> 23:14.837
of experienced people, but without losing, and 
nobody wanted to lose any of the sense that these

23:00.421 --> 23:14.837
institutions were in any way withdrawing from 
HARC or their commitment. So in one-on-one

23:15.543 --> 23:22.029
sessions with each of the presidents of the 
universities, I talked through this with each one

23:15.543 --> 23:22.029
of them. Our individual and then collective 
agreement was that we would change it. Hark would

23:29.396 --> 23:33.300
be owned by Hark, not by them.

23:36.783 --> 23:37.584
Now, who appoints? Does the president still 
appoint? No. You make that appointment? No. The

23:42.948 --> 23:45.772
new bylaws are we have a 15-member board. The 
president of HARC, Texas A&M, Reich, UT Austin,

23:47.194 --> 23:55.026
and University of Houston all serve on HARC's 
board. Oh, OK. And then 10 members are elected. OK.

24:01.095 --> 24:08.346
So by having the presidents of those institutions 
serve on HARC's board, it still makes a very strong

24:01.095 --> 24:08.346
commitment of the institution. Certainly does. 
And we've got another level of experienced person

24:12.682 --> 24:16.085
as opposed to just a double E professor who's asked 
to serve. When did that change? Last year. Now, do

24:20.389 --> 24:30.238
you see Hart then as a, what's your view of Hart in 
terms of the Houston economic community, the

24:20.389 --> 24:30.238
Texas community, the regional, whatever? Where 
are you in terms of this whole complex? Well. You

24:37.845 --> 24:41.568
don't really see a woodlands entity here 
particularly at all. Woodlands only. Yeah, I

24:42.820 --> 24:44.382
mean, you have little to do. You just happen to 
reside in one of those. That's it. Okay, that's

24:46.845 --> 24:49.108
good. No, and I have a very, very global view of 
this. Yeah, that's what I mean. Which is probably

24:52.572 --> 25:03.184
so big that most people, A, would scoff at it 
because, E, it's too big, or, B, it's not

24:52.572 --> 25:03.184
understandable. Well, here in super colliders 
and supercomputers, you know, that's pretty big.

25:08.099 --> 25:09.581
Stop. And I assume you're going beyond that. Yeah, 
we are. At least that's my intention. But my view is

25:15.427 --> 25:31.906
that, and this is a global view, there's going to be 
maybe a dozen, probably less, regions on Earth

25:15.427 --> 25:31.906
that are going to be meaningful communities where 
bright people can really make things happen. And

25:33.027 --> 25:37.212
there's enough infrastructure and 
understanding of what to do with what I call an

25:33.027 --> 25:37.212
intellectual product. That America. You and your 
man are helping build that infrastructure. For

25:44.055 --> 25:45.577
the nation. But it happens to be domiciled. It's 
just circumstantial that it's here. I think it's

25:51.905 --> 25:54.027
the right place to be. Now, do you think Research 
Center is in North Carolina or Silicon Valley?

26:00.635 --> 26:04.940
Does any of that really enter into your thinking as 
a model? No, not much. I know it does more in Georgia

26:07.243 --> 26:09.105
than mine. But I think my view of this is much more 
global than George's.

26:16.718 --> 26:21.344
Which sometimes bothers me, because I have great 
respect for George's view. But George doesn't see

26:21.364 --> 26:28.875
things much international, doesn't really much 
like the international sense of things. Rarely

26:29.857 --> 26:34.343
travels outside of the country. But that's not a 
criticism, it's an observation. His interest in

26:38.802 --> 27:04.270
the globe and global issues is well known and 
certainly he's an unusual thinker on things like

26:38.802 --> 27:04.270
energy from a global perspective and population 
control and the environment and those issues and

26:38.802 --> 27:04.270
very much interested in those issues and 
independently supports and involves himself

26:38.802 --> 27:04.270
with that.

27:07.861 --> 27:20.495
This goes back to my personal gut-level feeling of 
20 years ago, at least, is that we as a nation have

27:07.861 --> 27:20.495
got to do something more in the economic feeding 
chain. And those of us that have had the benefit of

27:20.636 --> 27:37.615
an education and have an opportunity, 
particularly from a science and technology point

27:20.636 --> 27:37.615
of view, to do something about turning these ideas 
into meaningful value-added products have got to

27:20.636 --> 27:37.615
do something more than sit behind the hedges. I 
guess this really began to settle in on me when I was

27:38.303 --> 27:54.779
arguing for the budgets in the Texas legislature 
and getting a first-hand view of all the other

27:38.303 --> 27:54.779
demands on the tax dollar and thinking through the 
feeding chain.

27:57.902 --> 28:05.830
If there weren't a lot of healthy Texas 
instruments out there, there weren't a lot of

27:57.902 --> 28:05.830
healthy people living up and down the streets that 
we all live on, with enough money to send their kids

28:07.312 --> 28:29.431
to college, who we could then, as professors, have 
the privilege of training, who could then go out

28:07.312 --> 28:29.431
and use their logically trained minds to generate 
in a competitive way new products and new jobs that

28:07.312 --> 28:29.431
pay the taxes, that send the money to Austin, that 
give it back to the universities in the line-iron

28:07.312 --> 28:29.431
budget. And the worst thing that we could do would 
be to quit working with the source of the funds that

28:29.471 --> 28:36.137
feed us. And that feeding chain is just not 
understood on a campus. Money just comes from

28:41.074 --> 28:42.396
somewhere. They owe it to us because God sent me 
here as an educated person to do good things. I'm

28:48.225 --> 29:04.249
trying to develop really as much for our nation as 
for our state or our city, although I believe we're

28:48.225 --> 29:04.249
in the right state and the best city to do it. And I 
think we're in the best part of the city to do it.

29:07.420 --> 29:12.726
Even in retrospect, if I was starting it all over, 
and I had the choice, I'd do it here. And certainly

29:13.808 --> 29:26.103
being done with the right people, and that is 
particularly George, who has been an incredible

29:13.808 --> 29:26.103
supporter of this institution. It goes well 
beyond any self-interest of helping the

29:26.123 --> 29:32.530
woodlands, what George is doing. I mean, he'll not 
see the return investment-wise, on what he's put

29:36.985 --> 29:40.468
into HARC. And he has a genuine interest and vision 
in the institutions that are affiliated with HARC

29:40.889 --> 29:48.956
and an appreciation for that and a desire to see 
this happen.

29:54.241 --> 30:04.191
But I'm convinced that, as a nation, we have to 
discover a new way to compete or we're not going to

29:54.241 --> 30:04.191
be competitive. I think it's already happening to 
us. the bright people that we have, whether

30:07.495 --> 30:24.542
they're in the academic sector, the industry 
sector, or the government sector, there's about

30:07.495 --> 30:24.542
2%, equivalent

30:07.495 --> 30:24.542
with the number I use, 2%. I call them the 2%ers, 
that are not fully employed, regardless of which

30:24.823 --> 30:31.393
sector they're in. If they're in the academic 
sector, industry finds them and hires them as

30:33.635 --> 30:38.863
consultants. Government finds them and uses them 
in different capacities. Advisors, whatever. If

30:48.377 --> 30:58.292
they're in the industry sector, they teach a 
course in the university as a visiting professor

30:48.377 --> 30:58.292
or they start something else in their garage. 
These are people whose energy level and intellect

30:58.677 --> 31:08.533
goes beyond what the institution's normal 
ability to absorb it and effectively use it is. And

31:08.553 --> 31:13.160
these people typically cause problems in those 
institutions. They're the ones, though, by the

31:13.180 --> 31:23.537
view of the other 98%, but they're the ones that 
drag the institutions kicking and screaming into

31:13.180 --> 31:23.537
the future. In an academic environment, there's 
no synergistic place where these two presenters

31:24.327 --> 31:29.553
can come together.

31:33.858 --> 31:51.398
So if you're off consulting for Boeing and you're 
an aerospace engineer at major university X, then

31:33.858 --> 31:51.398
you rarely ever see the engineer from major 
university Y who also consults for Boeing, unless

31:33.858 --> 31:51.398
they happen to put you the same project, or 
certainly if they're consulting for McDonnell

31:51.952 --> 31:55.535
Douglas.

31:58.418 --> 32:19.478
And in this kind of general sense, this intuitive 
sense that there's value in bringing a Texas

31:58.418 --> 32:19.478
Instruments and a Texas A&M together, a place to 
more

31:58.418 --> 32:19.478
comfortably do that and to learn how to do it more 
efficiently, more effectively. is what I think

32:20.639 --> 32:23.382
we're missing. It's not that we need in our toolbox 
to throw away some tools. We need to add a new one

32:26.586 --> 32:32.474
that's a crescent wrench that can be adjusted to 
fit the needs of the moment. And the old

32:32.494 --> 32:41.105
traditional ones that always work or usually work 
on the standard things that society has to do,

32:32.494 --> 32:41.105
great. You still need the set of box ins. But we've 
got to have a new kind of a crescent wrench in there

32:44.247 --> 32:53.539
that can deal with a changing situation and is 
adjustable and adaptable. So this is a different

32:53.600 --> 32:55.823
breed of horse. You're putting together the same 
corral. They're the free spirits from academia,

32:58.827 --> 33:05.215
from industry, and government. And let me tell you 
how it's begun to work already.

33:11.664 --> 33:13.326
You get a guy like Russ Hewson. who's a professor of 
physics at Texas A&M. He was recruited in here from

33:16.199 --> 33:24.811
Fermilab as an integral part of the early team that 
put us in the competition for a super pilot. And he

33:27.115 --> 33:43.178
holds himself up above all others as a scientist 
interested in basic physics, but singularly does

33:27.115 --> 33:43.178
one of the best jobs around here of moving his 
technology. that spins out of pursuing building a

33:43.799 --> 33:52.169
system that'll break open a quark so we can 
understand the fundamental principles of

33:43.799 --> 33:52.169
matter. The magnets that we designed for the super 
collider have incredibly interesting

33:54.392 --> 34:02.922
applications for magnetic resonance imaging. 
And we've created a company with Baylor called

34:02.942 --> 34:11.933
BayMed, and we're trying to now work with Humana 
Hospital and Siemens in College Station, as a

34:02.942 --> 34:11.933
matter of fact. produce the first prototype and 
put it into the private sector for profit. We're

34:19.810 --> 34:27.360
working with… Now is this sort of venture capital 
operation or is this a… No, this sure is venture

34:19.810 --> 34:27.360
capital. It's a company that Hark and Baylor 
decided to create, which we did two years ago. Did

34:33.707 --> 34:34.969
you use the venture capital? No, no, we put our own 
money. We used our own in-house money. Bill

34:39.706 --> 34:47.034
Butler, who's president of Baylor and myself, 
just got together and he put in his half and I put in

34:39.706 --> 34:47.034
my half. And

34:47.395 --> 34:56.145
the company now has the license to the technology, 
which HARC owns.

34:58.928 --> 35:09.240
And we have a contractual agreement and we license 
this rather than starting a company here to build

34:58.928 --> 35:09.240
MRI magnets to compete with Brooker and Siemens 
and Hitachi. I mean, that's not the way to go in this

35:12.822 --> 35:15.566
particular instance. You license that 
technology. But that same magnet, we're working

35:18.451 --> 35:31.450
with General Electric and General Dynamics

35:18.451 --> 35:31.450
in superconducting magnetic energy storage 
device. And now we're forming with Texas A&M a

35:31.470 --> 35:38.620
consortium of General Motors and McDonnell 
Douglas. to work on maglev train technology using

35:39.427 --> 35:47.619
that same mag with a new application, which is 
technology that HARC owns. And we've applied for

35:48.380 --> 35:55.671
patents on that so that we could have an 
American-based maglev technology. Now, here's

35:55.691 --> 36:02.061
this physics professor otherwise doing all this. 
And it's happening at HARC. And it wouldn't happen

36:04.544 --> 36:07.088
in the physics department. And here is Monique 
Talwani. Who is your contact at Texas A&M as a part

36:11.569 --> 36:17.415
of that collaboration? On the maglev? Yeah. It's a 
guy named Bill Harris, who works in the Texas

36:19.437 --> 36:23.581
Transportation Institute. And he's the Steve 
Chair of Engineering, the old railroad group. We

36:30.267 --> 36:32.489
looked for five years to fill that chair. I 
remember it well. And I was staying in touch with

36:34.551 --> 36:37.294
Charlie Wooten, who's the director of the 
Transportation Institute. And of course, Bill,

36:40.880 --> 36:47.085
who's Bill Mobley, who's on my board and president 
of ADM. So Bill is in the loop on all of this. And

36:51.649 --> 37:07.382
that's one of the other values, I think, of the 
structure, the new structure of HARC, is that the

36:51.649 --> 37:07.382
presidents of the universities, as members of 
HARC's board, have the opportunity to declare

37:08.392 --> 37:31.412
early on

37:08.392 --> 37:31.412
about their own institutional interest and 
potential conflict of interest that might occur

37:08.392 --> 37:31.412
that we can discuss openly in a board meeting well 
before we find ourselves in the middle of

37:08.392 --> 37:31.412
something that happened at the dean's level that 
finally surfaced administratively or at the

37:31.510 --> 37:36.876
board level. So you stripped away a lot of the 
bureaucracy. Well, hopefully, I've tried to be

37:39.579 --> 37:45.165
efficient in the way we can communicate and decide 
that this is what we're going to do. What about from

37:46.786 --> 37:47.748
the other side? You know, you're gifted, perhaps 
uniquely gifted, in the sense that you had

37:48.508 --> 37:56.497
experience with industry and academia. Is there a 
opportunities for somebody like Exxon, for

37:59.978 --> 38:08.289
example, to come to HARC and say, we need basic R&D 
on issue X. Is that happening? Oh, yeah. I was just

38:11.293 --> 38:14.697
going to give you an example with Tawani. And let me 
give you the history again to show you some of the

38:14.897 --> 38:23.108
leverage power of the institution when it can be 
taken advantage of by one of our collaborative

38:14.897 --> 38:23.108
members. And this worked at A&M with the 
internment station. And when the colleges

38:27.373 --> 38:29.496
learned how to use it, really is what leveraged the 
research growth. You're far better off if you've

38:33.529 --> 38:39.095
got one full-time position to hire two half-time 
people. The question is, what do you do with the

38:40.536 --> 38:42.718
other two half-times? Well, if you put them over in 
the engineering experiment section, and you've

38:44.460 --> 38:57.073
got one tenure track position, and that's all 
otherwise academically you have, hire two people

38:44.460 --> 38:57.073
on a half-time budget. They're going to work 
full-time anyway. you're going to get two

38:59.058 --> 39:00.400
full-time people. We all know how we get leveraged 
like that. And offload the other half over in the

39:03.984 --> 39:08.410
other agency, in the sister institution. And then 
watch them for a while. And then pick the litter.

39:14.437 --> 39:17.261
And that's what engineering was doing for years 
there. Well, in the case of Hart now, particularly

39:18.463 --> 39:26.753
with Rice, a smaller institution, focused 
historically extremely high quality

39:27.070 --> 39:32.396
undergraduate education, desires to build its 
graduate research program. Hard to attract a

39:34.519 --> 39:49.517
Stanford professor who's got a $250 million a year 
research institution and all the leverage that

39:34.519 --> 39:49.517
that brings to an institution with a $20 million a 
year research.

39:53.277 --> 40:09.314
So in 1985,

39:53.277 --> 40:09.314
after I had been here maybe six or eight months, 
Norm Hackerman called me, who was president of

39:53.277 --> 40:09.314
Rice, and said, gee, Skip, you've created a 
geotechnology research institute to support the

39:53.277 --> 40:09.314
energy industry. Now, I know you're looking for a 
director. I've got a chance to hire one of the top

40:10.695 --> 40:21.867
five geophysicists in the world, a guy named Mike 
Talwani, who was the first director of Lamont at

40:10.695 --> 40:21.867
Columbia, who was chief scientist of Gulf, and 
when Chevron bought Gulf, he didn't want to do

40:22.572 --> 40:29.960
that, and we want to offer him the Schlumberger 
chair of geophysics and bring him to Rice. But I

40:30.941 --> 40:45.135
can't pay him enough to get him out of that chair, 
and I can't get him anyway because the scope of the

40:30.941 --> 40:45.135
research and the opportunity to develop a major 
research program is just too limited. But if he's

40:45.155 --> 40:50.841
at heart and he can develop and direct the 
Geotechnology Research Institute, Then the

40:52.711 --> 40:57.216
combination of Rice and Hart together is very 
intriguing and interesting. And if you could pay a

40:57.276 --> 41:03.823
third of his salary, I'll pay two thirds of his 
salary out of the chair. And then together, we can

41:04.303 --> 41:08.467
pay the salaries that are required. And I'll 
commit as president of Rice to put him at Hart for

41:09.108 --> 41:19.559
100% time for the first three years to help get the 
problem

41:09.108 --> 41:19.559
solved. That sounds like a deal. There was, and we 
did it. But look at the advantage to Texas, to

41:23.232 --> 41:39.066
America, so that you can keep this kind of 
productive talent moving and excited and

41:23.232 --> 41:39.066
challenged to grow rather than just say, oh, well, 
okay, for this phase of my life, I'll just go be a

41:23.232 --> 41:39.066
professional and kind of throttle back. We don't 
need throttle back. We need throttle forward in

41:40.647 --> 41:42.629
America. The competitive heat on the street out 
there is tough. And...

41:53.512 --> 42:01.424
You know, HARC is not unfolding as I thought it 
would five years ago in the details. Overall, I

42:03.107 --> 42:05.450
couldn't be happier. We're well in the window of 
expectation, maybe somewhat above the center

42:06.732 --> 42:12.821
part. The structure, I couldn't have written it 
down five years ago. It took me three years to

42:15.926 --> 42:20.633
figure out where I thought it needed to do by just 
on-the-job training. There isn't a recipe to

42:21.338 --> 42:22.820
follow. I mean, I can't study what somebody else 
did here. I can read about SRI, which I've done,

42:26.363 --> 42:38.857
about RTI, and study the relationships between a 
federally funded lab like Lincoln and MIT and try

42:26.363 --> 42:38.857
to get the best of all of that. But we're doing 
something here from scratch. This is empirically

42:41.760 --> 42:44.663
being built, in my mind. And I'm just flying by the 
seat of my pants and trying to use all the good

42:45.183 --> 42:51.913
talent and advice on my board and other places I can 
get. And you see yourself primarily as a

42:52.514 --> 42:58.664
facilitator of innovation, of new ideas? In part, 
but not primarily. It's hard to come up with a real

43:01.408 --> 43:05.935
simple way to say what we're primarily... You're 
not in research, I mean, technically. Oh, yes, we

43:06.075 --> 43:06.796
are. You're in research. Yes, we are. Yes, we are. 
And what... So you take a guy now like Andy

43:11.363 --> 43:13.266
Blanchard. who's just replaced David Norton as 
director of the Star Center. And he just made full

43:18.001 --> 43:25.230
professor tenure at UT Arlington.

43:25.250 --> 43:27.353
Bright, high energy, two percenter. He has that 
same feeling about America, that he can't put to

43:29.376 --> 43:40.671
work the talents and the energy that's in him 
Within the framework. Within the framework of

43:42.391 --> 43:49.278
where he is to deliver what he knows or what he wants 
to try to deliver for the country. Mitch Eggers

43:50.019 --> 43:52.602
just joined us from MIT in Lincoln. Was the number 
one PhD student at Texas A&M eight years ago in

43:55.265 --> 44:01.372
electrical engineering. Incredible reviews 
from MIT. What? Just picked up the phone. six

44:09.507 --> 44:15.114
months ago and called his major professor, John 
Painter, an old colleague and friend of mine at

44:09.507 --> 44:15.114
A&M, and says, I've got to get out of here. This 
place isn't going to hold together. These people

44:17.658 --> 44:21.162
up here just think the federal government is going 
to be able to continue to send money. And I've been

44:22.164 --> 44:27.851
screaming this other story, and nobody 
understands it. Painter said, why don't you call

44:27.871 --> 44:29.513
Skip Porter? And he called me. I said, come down and 
let's talk. And I listened to him in here in my

44:33.559 --> 44:39.126
office for an hour while he said to me what I've been 
trying to say to you. And I said, why don't you come

44:40.051 --> 44:43.536
on down here? You found it. And he's here now. He 
could be anywhere. Now Rice is going to suck him up

44:47.802 --> 44:51.948
and make a joint appointment. But this will be his 
primary place. And he'll outlet and stay in touch.

44:57.716 --> 44:59.037
I've got on the Rice faculty. I don't want to lose my 
academic ties. I don't want to lose that. And you

45:02.422 --> 45:07.049
have someone's man in you that you have a similar 
arrangement with, don't you? Some new person that

45:07.069 --> 45:08.050
we've... acquired there? Well, of course, Russ 
Hewson, the director of the Accelerator Center,

45:11.549 --> 45:16.595
is a faculty member. Oh, and we also have Dimitri 
Nonopoulos. Well, I'll tell you the story of

45:22.362 --> 45:23.644
Dimitri. George may have already told you this. He 
loves to tell it. No. Well, I and him hired him from

45:28.289 --> 45:32.775
Wisconsin. And Dimitri is one of the top 
theoretical astral particle physicist in the

45:36.110 --> 45:44.479
world, was mentioned in scientists as a possible 
recipient for the Nobel Prize in physics this

45:36.110 --> 45:44.479
year. And he came to College Station with his wife. 
And this was Thanksgiving a year ago, the day

45:51.046 --> 45:55.170
before. Because I remember it well, because 
George and I were here with the Metis Foundation,

45:55.951 --> 46:02.398
right here sitting at this very table. And we get 
this call from Peter McIntyre. And Colossation's

46:06.063 --> 46:13.855
saying,

46:06.063 --> 46:13.855
Dimitri's wife has looked at Colossation and 
says, he's not living here. And he said he can't

46:13.875 --> 46:15.738
take the job.

46:18.803 --> 46:29.960
And we've told him that we've got some other people 
that live in the woodlands and are on a joint

46:18.803 --> 46:29.960
apartment, and maybe we could make arrangements 
for him to be able to work at Hark, but still hold his

46:18.803 --> 46:29.960
factory, but live in the woodlands. Could you show 
him around? I said, well, sit him on down here. And,

46:35.628 --> 46:40.796
of course, Russ was here, and he and his wife Joyce 
toured Dimitri and his wife around. But George and

46:40.836 --> 46:51.573
I happened to be here and met Dimitri and his wife, 
and they fell in love with the Woodlands, and

46:40.836 --> 46:51.573
they're big city people, and Houston was great, 
and they loved Hark. And so he kept the job at A&M

46:51.673 --> 46:57.602
because Hark was here.
