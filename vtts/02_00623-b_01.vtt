00:01.550 --> 00:08.560
The people who stole the Romans often sank before 
they got to Rome. Venus de Milo, for example,

00:08.580 --> 00:14.248
Victoria Soundface, there are many others. Those 
are all from Seaport. How long have you been

00:18.334 --> 00:23.001
interested in treasures from the sea? Maybe since 
I was going to be an archaeologist. All right.

00:25.865 --> 00:26.646
But... Of course, what are considered treasures 
by an archaeologist and marine geologist would

00:28.347 --> 00:39.518
not be treasures in the mind of the common people. 
They're mainly interested in gold and silver. And

00:42.120 --> 00:46.705
the old-timers didn't have very much of that. Most 
of the coins of the ancient world are bronze,

00:46.725 --> 00:52.390
depending on the group. But there's, for example, 
in Vasa, they found... about 4,000 bronze pieces,

00:57.980 --> 01:05.630
bronze coins, and just one silver piece. And the 
only piece of gold was a ring at the setting and

01:05.650 --> 01:09.214
fall. So it's not treasure in that sense. It's 
treasure in terms of knowledge, however.

01:18.766 --> 01:25.995
There is such treasure off this coast, but it's 
hard to read it because the people couldn't write

01:18.766 --> 01:25.995
on this coast. and in other civilizations they 
could write. So that there's a vast knowledge

01:30.797 --> 01:37.648
about it. In fact, it's even conceivable that the 
Phoenicians and Celts visit North America. Those

01:44.078 --> 01:53.012
maps, the map up there shows potential track 
routes and places where sites have been found with

01:44.078 --> 01:53.012
writings It can be translated from Phoenician and 
Ogham, which is a Celtic language. Now, there's no

01:58.640 --> 02:03.687
treasure involved in it, gold and silver, but 
there's a lot of knowledge. And these voyages

02:03.707 --> 02:08.614
would have taken place from B.C. Not very well 
accepted, because people don't like that. People

02:13.922 --> 02:14.663
preceded Columbus. Of course, the first people to 
come probably came by way of Bering Strait, It's

02:22.675 --> 02:33.354
certainly in 12,000 B.C., and probably some 
before that, long before that, 35,000 or so. But

02:33.374 --> 02:42.149
the earlier ones were not very numerous, and 
enough will document

02:33.374 --> 02:42.149
maybe mistakes. To illustrate it still further, 
along this coast here, I got interested a few years

02:46.435 --> 03:00.263
ago in the, a lot of flint was present, piles of 
flint in the marshes, and flint that's used for

02:46.435 --> 03:00.263
streets and stone fences. Turns out most of this 
was ballast brought by ships from England and

03:00.764 --> 03:06.115
France. ships would come empty and ballast and go 
back with furs and cotton and tobacco and dump the

03:06.871 --> 03:17.908
ballast before they loaded them. But it turns out 
that it probably is 100,000 tons of that flint

03:17.928 --> 03:24.758
ballast on this coast. And several of us were 
interested in it together and found a couple

03:24.778 --> 03:31.809
pieces that looked like artifacts. So one was a 
very nice flint core from which It looked like

03:36.200 --> 03:39.464
chips had been struck. We sent the cork to a British 
museum, and of course when they found that it was

03:39.484 --> 03:51.960
from the New World, it wasn't very popular to have 
Old World paleolithic artifacts from the New

03:39.484 --> 03:51.960
World. But when the ballast was picked up from the 
beaches, most of it was double hand-sized. Other

03:59.910 --> 04:05.397
people who picked it up wouldn't pay attention 
whether they had an artifact or not, so there are

03:59.910 --> 04:05.397
probably a lot of them on this coast. So that's an 
illustration of New York archaeology only going

04:06.473 --> 04:25.899
back 300 years, maybe

04:06.473 --> 04:25.899
400

04:06.473 --> 04:25.899
years. I want to ask some formal questions about 
oceanography. That's extraordinarily

04:28.603 --> 04:30.645
interesting, by the way. I'm a great believer in 
pre-Columbian contact. As a matter of fact,

04:37.507 --> 04:44.518
People don't generally know it, but when the 
Pilgrims came and established their village, you

04:37.507 --> 04:44.518
remember an Indian walked down the street, 
Swanto. He said, welcome, Englishman. In

04:47.463 --> 04:47.683
English. He'd been across the ocean four times 
already. And the Pilgrims were novices. They went

04:56.578 --> 04:58.661
to Plymouth. They intended to hit Carolinas, but 
they missed. And they were afraid to go around the

05:01.946 --> 05:03.649
Cape. And they settled in Plymouth, which had 
already been mapped four times and visited at

05:04.439 --> 05:12.850
least six times before by literate people. But 
mapping it within four times was well-known. In

05:16.275 --> 05:29.512
fact, it was probably the early visitors that 
spread the tuberculosis and other diseases that

05:16.275 --> 05:29.512
eliminated the Indians that made it possible for 
the pogroms to stay,

05:16.275 --> 05:29.512
which is curious. But always before the first, 
there's some more That's right.

05:39.655 --> 05:44.343
As long as we're sort of wandering around here, I 
mean, have you ever read William McNeil's Plagues

05:39.655 --> 05:44.343
and Pestilence? No, I haven't. I don't think I 
have. I suggest that to you. Is that the one that's

05:48.630 --> 05:53.278
related to Thera?

05:54.170 --> 06:07.047
No, this is a historical study of the impact of 
disease on primitive peoples and what impact

05:54.170 --> 06:07.047
plagues have had upon population spreading. 
They're very serious, aren't they? Yeah, and it's

06:08.950 --> 06:12.855
overwhelmingly important to your work in 
anthropology. Of course, this was known to the

06:12.875 --> 06:16.100
early settlers. In fact, you probably know that 
Hudson Bay Company gave blankets and smallpox to

06:16.120 --> 06:23.890
the Indians. The French paid them for scalps. I'm 
not sure they even had scalps before they were paid

06:26.407 --> 06:30.852
for it. There's some debate over that, but most 
people think that the Plains Indians at least did

06:30.872 --> 06:37.379
not take scalps until they came into contact with 
it. They got paid for it. Got paid for it.

06:42.806 --> 06:48.072
In returning to some sort of formal question I need 
to ask about oceanography,

06:50.566 --> 06:58.593
Besides advice to students, what do you think were 
the most important technological advances in

06:50.566 --> 06:58.593
oceanography during your career? Well, there's 
so many of them, it's hard to tell. I remember going

07:05.299 --> 07:13.066
out on EW scripts on the cruises, and we were much 
interested in the flashing light echo sounder. It

07:13.367 --> 07:17.030
didn't record, but we could read the depths and 
write it down at two-minute intervals. And so,

07:17.991 --> 07:20.573
really, the first... recording echo sounders 
were

07:21.363 --> 07:30.836
a great advance over the business of writing it 
down to human animals. The development of seismic

07:31.377 --> 07:35.602
profiling was a very important thing. Ewing had 
much to do with that when he was here before he went

07:36.003 --> 07:39.948
to Lamar. And

07:41.010 --> 07:49.902
the early Devices were like Ekman bottles and so 
forth, snappers,

07:50.168 --> 07:57.936
and so forth. Made a great advance over nothing, 
but those have now been vastly improved. It's hard

08:02.961 --> 08:03.642
to say. It follows a logarithmic curve. So what is 
the most important point of a logarithmic curve?

08:08.567 --> 08:11.890
Sometimes the first point is more important, but 
it's pretty low. And new points later on are much

08:11.910 --> 08:17.376
more expensive and difficult. Precision timing 
is important. in profiling and in lots of other

08:20.122 --> 08:23.567
things. In chemistry, it's clear that the major 
advances, major technologies are ones that are

08:24.548 --> 08:34.341
adept. Land chemistry, neutron activation,

08:34.361 --> 08:42.332
spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, electron 
microscopy. Many things like that were just

08:46.865 --> 08:54.654
adapted to the ocean for physical oceanography.

08:56.116 --> 09:04.005
The recording devices to record the temperature 
and slendium, oxygen content with depths of

08:56.116 --> 09:04.005
reinforcements. The Nansen bottle was such a 
useful thing, which Nansen developed. Nassman

09:08.502 --> 09:13.127
was a statesman, by the way, as well as being an 
oceanographer. League of Nations delegate.

09:17.011 --> 09:19.653
But I think he was at the equivalent of League of 
Nations at the time. Anyway, it's such a useful

09:19.673 --> 09:32.667
device that it's held up the development of better 
ones that may be a detriment rather than a

09:19.673 --> 09:32.667
negative, rather than a plus in a sense. But the 
buoys that are developed, the long-term buoys,

09:33.267 --> 09:37.952
are very important ones for them. the geologists 
of course use so many different geophysical tools

09:38.911 --> 10:05.087
that they're best used in combination seismic 
profile when we do seismic profiling we

09:38.911 --> 10:05.087
occasionally use a seismic refraction with 
disposable sonic buoys the do make magnetics at

09:38.911 --> 10:05.087
the same time drag a magnetometer it doesn't cost 
anymore as long as they're going same way for

09:38.911 --> 10:05.087
gravity so we measure gravity magnetics, 
acoustics all at the same time. So a lot of these

10:08.837 --> 10:11.861
things. Which is more important? I don't know. 
Now, finally, of course, you have to test the

10:14.524 --> 10:19.470
inferences from geophysics by drilling. And of 
course, the deep-sea drilling is a big jump ahead

10:19.490 --> 10:23.155
of that. We still don't know whether the 
continental rises contain no oil or not, because

10:23.795 --> 10:31.245
no holes have been drilled in it. In the DSDP 
deep-sea drilling project, They tried to avoid

10:34.497 --> 10:42.571
deep holes because they're afraid they might hit 
oil and verizes, and there's no way of cutting off

10:34.497 --> 10:42.571
the bit. So now with the Glomar Explorer, or a ship 
equivalent to that, it can be done, but it costs

10:42.591 --> 10:58.378
about $60 million a year to operate compared to 
only $15 million a year for the Glomar Challenger.

10:58.915 --> 11:00.838
And now is that more important? It is more 
important now, but you had to begin and build on

11:01.299 --> 11:07.047
something else first. Like you say, all 
scientists are standing on the shoulders of

11:07.067 --> 11:10.893
predecessors. All equipment is standing on the 
tops of the previous equipment. Were there any, I

11:15.901 --> 11:27.859
don't want to use the word discovery because 
that's too strong, but were there any theories

11:15.901 --> 11:27.859
advanced in oceanography which came as a shock to 
you during your lifetime? Something that was

11:28.480 --> 11:29.922
unexpected? Oh, sure, yeah. For example, I'd 
known about turbidity. I'd known about ripple

11:38.531 --> 11:44.598
marks in the shallow water organisms in what 
apparently otherwise would have been deep water.

11:45.359 --> 11:49.263
This is in the Pliocene at Los Angeles Basin. And 
I'd thought about it quite a bit, but it never

11:49.283 --> 11:56.631
occurred to me that... turbidity currents would 
have been the cause. I wish I'd thought about it,

12:01.006 --> 12:03.210
but I didn't. That's a way to evaluate a good idea, 
when you wish you'd thought of yourself. Now, of

12:07.277 --> 12:12.687
course, the same thing is true for plate 
tectonics. Wegener had the general concept, but

12:12.707 --> 12:19.399
he knew the facts only from the land and not from the 
seafloor, and there's more seafloor. And then,

12:20.601 --> 12:22.264
curious enough, the magnetic work that was done 
off Northern California was classified as by the

12:22.801 --> 12:28.070
Navy. And when that finally was released and 
studied more carefully, that showed the magnetic

12:28.090 --> 12:43.575
stripes, which is a fundamental incentive toward 
adding to Wegener's data left on the seafloor. And

12:44.536 --> 12:49.905
once the general concept of seafloor spreading is 
made, And you see how nice that fits in with the

12:50.257 --> 12:56.787
known areas of volcanism and the known areas of 
deep-sea trenches. Again, I felt that that was a

12:56.807 --> 13:00.052
fine idea. I wish I'd thought about it more. Okay.

13:07.483 --> 13:16.757
Both of those came in during the time I've been 
around.

13:16.777 --> 13:17.759
Yeah. As a geologist, the uh there's a great deal of 
talk presently about about bringing minerals out

13:19.214 --> 13:38.303
of the ocean to

13:19.214 --> 13:38.303
uh possibly refurbish man's stay here on earth are 
you optimistic or pessimistic about that well the

13:19.214 --> 13:38.303
oil oil and gas from the sea floor now has a value of 
about um about 50 billion dollars from the sea

13:38.992 --> 14:00.848
floor and uh that's more than twice the value of all 
the fish that are caught all the food in the ocean so

13:38.992 --> 14:00.848
there's no doubt what that's that's a very 
important thing for the ocean and there's

13:38.992 --> 14:00.848
probably a lot more there the bulk of it probably 
must still be there because As I said, we haven't

14:01.351 --> 14:05.538
even drilled the continental rise to know what's 
there. And very little drilling has been done

14:06.159 --> 14:08.843
beyond the continental shelf. Most of the 
continental shelves of the world haven't really

14:09.784 --> 14:19.720
been thoroughly examined because of mainly 
inhospitable climates or inhospitable

14:09.784 --> 14:19.720
politics. And so there's an enormous amount of oil 
still left. But we don't know how much there is,

14:25.870 --> 14:31.417
mainly because of continental rise, which has 
about half the sediments of the world. So there's

14:32.318 --> 14:34.421
no way to tell. Now we hear a lot about the manganese 
nodules, but it's exaggerated and way out of line.

14:41.149 --> 14:46.436
For example, the manganese itself is probably not 
worth anything. The cost of extraction, except as

14:46.456 --> 14:49.339
a byproduct, would be too much. But the copper, 
nickel, and cobalt are the valuable metals that

14:49.359 --> 14:55.227
are present in them. And are more concentrated in 
the sea floor nodules, at least the copper is, than

14:56.819 --> 15:07.354
in very many deposits still remaining on land that 
are being worked. Now, if you consider the mining

15:07.414 --> 15:17.149
of the manganese nodules can penetrate the copper 
market 10 percent, pretty good penetration. But

15:17.770 --> 15:19.452
these three metals mined on land now amount to 
about $10 billion a year. Now, if you could

15:26.040 --> 15:44.622
penetrate the copper market 10% and carry the 
nickel and cobalt with it, and there's not too much

15:26.040 --> 15:44.622
of a drop in the price of cobalt when it's produced 
in large quantity, then you might suppose it'd be a

15:26.040 --> 15:44.622
billion dollars' worth of metals produced from 
the sea floor. Now, it would cost an unknown amount

15:44.642 --> 15:48.747
to recover them, But if the difference between 
the, if the profit, the amount left over from the

15:48.997 --> 16:09.290
cost of production is as much as 10%,

15:48.997 --> 16:09.290
and that's available to the United Nations 
Seafloor Seabed Committee, which it wants,

15:48.997 --> 16:09.290
that's only $100 million. Now, if you divide that 
amongst the undeveloped countries in the world as

16:09.370 --> 16:14.599
they want, Assuming that seabed authority has no 
cost for operation, which is certainly not the

16:14.883 --> 16:25.121
case, that's $700,000 a country. And if it's 
divided amongst the population of undeveloped

16:25.902 --> 16:31.733
countries in the world, that's three cents per 
capita per year. It doesn't buy very much rice. And

16:34.778 --> 16:39.827
the problem is, of course, that the cost has 
been... has been put all out of all proportion. I

16:43.844 --> 16:52.280
mean, the potential profits has been imagined all 
out of proportion by the people from undeveloped

16:43.844 --> 16:52.280
countries. Not one of the undeveloped countries 
or any combination of all 140 of them can mine this

16:52.300 --> 16:57.951
stuff. And it can be mined by half a dozen countries 
of the world, the industrial advanced countries.

17:05.363 --> 17:10.892
So the UN wants the countries that can mine it to 
mine it, and for them to have the profits. I don't

17:11.593 --> 17:14.838
think it will happen. And if it's mined at all, it 
will be. probably by private enterprise that has a

17:19.548 --> 17:27.456
contract with the governments of the advanced 
countries. The United States may make unilateral

17:27.476 --> 17:32.401
leasing next year or the year after. Can't wait 
forever on the United Nations. So the manganese is

17:35.925 --> 17:37.627
not so very much. A hundred million dollars profit 
is a lot for a company, but it's nothing for the

17:38.248 --> 17:43.573
world. Now, the economy overlooked in the 
resources from the seafloor is sand and gravel.

17:53.027 --> 18:01.256
And that's about a half a million dollars, half a 
billion dollars of sand and gravels recovered

17:53.027 --> 18:01.256
every year in the seafloor. Much of it's from, more 
than half it's probably from the North Sea,

18:01.276 --> 18:10.306
England and France, and some, and quite a lot from 
New York. It's used mainly for landfill and for

18:10.707 --> 18:18.816
construction purposes, particularly in densely 
populated coastal regions where The city is built

18:19.066 --> 18:25.638
on top of previously available sand, gravel, and 
river sources. Now, after the sand and gravel,

18:25.658 --> 18:41.327
then you come to the heavy metals like tin and 
ilmenite, various titanium metals, and

18:25.658 --> 18:41.327
magnetite, iron metals. Those have a total value 
of about $50 million. And after that, you're

18:46.104 --> 18:49.229
dealing with shells and pearls. The total value 
for those might be as much as 10 million. After

18:54.676 --> 18:56.719
that, there's very little left. There isn't any 
gold and no diamonds produced in the seafloor, in

18:57.220 --> 19:02.167
spite of the land nations. And there probably 
never will be.

19:07.345 --> 19:12.594
So is it fair to say you're certain and optimistic 
about international control? Yeah. But it seems

19:15.560 --> 19:24.696
like from an outsider that oceanographers are 
going to come more and more under pressure and

19:15.560 --> 19:24.696
stress from international law and international 
agencies. Well, a period of benign neglect is

19:25.722 --> 19:28.568
helpful in that case. For example, Brazil, 10 
years or so ago, made a law saying, thou shalt not

19:29.109 --> 19:36.185
investigate our shelf. So sure enough, nobody 
went there. And I had a phone call one day from

19:38.991 --> 19:46.026
Brazil saying, unfortunately, they didn't have 
any marine geologists, but we trained some for

19:38.991 --> 19:46.026
them. Well, I took one, and we gave him some 
training and let him learn a little bit about

19:46.006 --> 19:53.855
methods and so forth. And out of that came a 
proposal, then, that we make a joint study of the

19:54.455 --> 20:06.949
Brazilian shell, and nothing much—didn't hear 
anything from that for about three years. And

20:06.989 --> 20:09.452
another phone call said, we're ready now. Can you 
bring a ship down next month and start work? And so I

20:12.668 --> 20:16.232
told them, no, because I'm involved in the work off 
of Africa. And I couldn't go to the NSF to get more

20:16.973 --> 20:22.679
money to work on another area before that was 
finished. So they wanted to know how much it would

20:22.699 --> 20:24.301
cost. I said, about a million dollars. And they 
said, oh, we'll furnish that. And so they

20:28.585 --> 20:34.351
furnished them their own ship and funds and so 
forth, probably about a million. And we made a

20:35.132 --> 20:41.359
general study of the sediments of the shelf and the 
general structure of the shelf, the shell of the

20:35.132 --> 20:41.359
structure, anyway. And

20:41.879 --> 20:48.387
I think exactly the same thing is going to happen 
with other countries. When we worked off of

20:48.988 --> 20:55.977
Africa, for example, I got permission from all but 
one of the 27 countries. Not one was Guinea. And

20:57.759 --> 21:04.748
Guinea is in a place where it's at the boundary 
between low oil potential to the east and high oil

21:05.200 --> 21:13.894
potential to the north, right at the junction, the 
shoulder of Africa. And I told that to a

21:13.914 --> 21:16.398
representative from Guinea. In fact, he was the 
ambassador, Pliny Potentiary, from Guinea. And

21:23.730 --> 21:26.655
he said, well, maybe you'd better come back. And I 
said, well, you can't do that. Guinea's too small.

21:30.293 --> 21:36.380
We just simply went around Guinea, and Furryfoot 
may be there from the side, so the loser is Guinea.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.063
They know nothing about what's there. Now, of 
course, they can make a contract with our company

21:40.264 --> 21:50.735
to go there and get some information, but there's 
no one in Guinea, no geologists in Guinea who can

21:40.264 --> 21:50.735
understand it. Have you foreseen a sort of, 
development of international cooperation where

21:58.255 --> 22:02.123
people like... Unilaterally. Unilaterally. 
That's right. For example, a couple years ago I was

22:03.906 --> 22:11.421
interested in a project to look at the Caribbean as 
a unit. There are a lot of governments there,

22:11.603 --> 22:22.416
different languages and so forth, but most of them 
have such a narrow view that they like to have work

22:11.603 --> 22:22.416
done off their coast, but not off other people's 
coasts. They want the results to be classified and

22:22.436 --> 22:26.160
so forth, so it doesn't get done. But Columbia and 
Venezuela were among the most interested. In

22:29.624 --> 22:32.628
fact, it's the most potential for new offshore 
oil. But as we were going on with the proposal for

22:33.609 --> 22:41.458
that, they nationalized the American Oil Company 
Holdings, so we just turned it all over. But I think

22:42.552 --> 22:45.677
that's the way it's going to be. The countries that 
know the least about it are the ones that are going

22:47.539 --> 22:53.528
to continue to learn the least. Then to stress the 
250-mile limit and whatever? Yeah. I think marine

22:58.055 --> 23:07.790
geologists are probably in a better position than 
other oceanographers because their results can

22:58.055 --> 23:07.790
have considerable economic value on the 
countries. And so there are many countries

23:07.810 --> 23:09.893
that... that are that are understood but many of 
them don't have any money for example um dave ross

23:10.700 --> 23:37.686
next door here made a study of the persian gulf in 
which the iranians paid the iranian side of the

23:10.700 --> 23:37.686
persian gulf in which the iranians paid for most of 
the work much of the work maybe not and the saudis

23:10.700 --> 23:37.686
would like to do the same thing on their side There 
are other problems about the Saudis, of course,

23:38.020 --> 23:54.038
because we have a lot of problems, public problems 
with anti-Semitism

23:38.020 --> 23:54.038
from the Saudis, and so it's not an easy place to 
work. In fact, that's a general problem because

23:54.098 --> 23:56.704
you can't find... very many countries that don't 
have an animosity against somebody. When we

24:01.700 --> 24:08.550
worked in Africa, we had to be careful to let the 
South Africans off in a place where they wouldn't

24:01.700 --> 24:08.550
get scalped, so to speak. And in fact, that 
illustrates it quite a bit, because I wrote

24:09.311 --> 24:19.345
hundreds of letters to African countries and 
people and institutions asking them to

24:09.311 --> 24:19.345
participate in the shipboard work. And we had 
people, five people from Ghana and one from

24:19.365 --> 24:24.733
Senegal for me. in spite of asking those. There was 
always some reason why they couldn't come, but the

24:28.171 --> 24:35.259
name came, I think, because we didn't have people 
to understand much of it. In contrast, South

24:35.279 --> 24:45.652
Africa asked, and we took eleven people from 
there, because the spaces weren't occupied

24:35.279 --> 24:45.652
anyway by black Africans. And we had people from 
Brazil, Argentina,

24:53.587 --> 24:56.770
Guatemala, Jamaica, many countries of Europe. So 
the people who needed it most didn't copy. And if

25:01.715 --> 25:05.939
they'd been aboard, they could copy anything they 
wanted to. And they wouldn't know what to copy,

25:06.099 --> 25:10.764
mostly, but that's their problem. So I think this 
sort of thing will continue, and we'll find that we

25:10.784 --> 25:18.852
can work many places in marine geology. That's 
good. You're more optimistic than I'd expected

25:21.623 --> 25:27.736
you to be as a marine geologist since continental 
shelves are closing off. Well, interestingly

25:28.818 --> 25:34.890
enough, one of the ones that looks the least likely 
to be funded is an American continental shelf.

25:34.910 --> 25:40.722
That's mainly because Congress has said that 
they'll have a federal program of exploration

25:34.910 --> 25:40.722
when we And that, of course, will be run by the 
United States Geological Survey. And the point is

25:44.127 --> 25:53.222
that they, in their innocence, think that the 
exploration can find the oil pools, and then they

25:44.127 --> 25:53.222
lease it to the companies which can pump them. They 
forget that most of the discoveries are made

25:53.242 --> 25:57.949
during the development of an oil field. But 
they'll have to wait.

26:02.757 --> 26:07.705
That's another kind of political oceanography.

26:08.292 --> 26:10.214
Excuse me, I caught your allergies. I don't think 
allergies is a problem. They think allergies are a

26:12.196 --> 26:13.437
problem. I hope they're not. I feel bad if that were 
the case. Thank

26:16.561 --> 26:22.767
you. What about government restrictions in 
oceanography? Do you feel as if you're coming

26:26.511 --> 26:32.898
under more government pressure, less freedom of 
activity to work? Sure. As a result... Those

26:35.849 --> 26:48.424
geographic labs have to have more and more people 
to satisfy the government regulations,

26:35.849 --> 26:48.424
bookkeeper labs and so forth. And of course, the 
Office of Naval Research funding is being

26:49.745 --> 26:56.613
considerably reduced now. And there was an 
amendment, I forgot what it's called.

26:59.677 --> 27:00.177
Mansefield. Mansefield, yeah, that's right. I 
knew the state, but I had forgotten the name. I

27:05.415 --> 27:07.138
mentioned it to somebody the other day. So this 
means that you have to have an applied basis for the

27:07.158 --> 27:16.590
work, and most times the application doesn't come 
until far later. In fact, I mentioned about the oil

27:17.411 --> 27:20.155
provinces here. Same for East Asia, same for

27:20.496 --> 27:25.643
West Africa. There's a lot of oil potential in 
places where it hasn't been drilled yet. But the

27:28.787 --> 27:31.911
main of the argument is that having to do with... 
who gets the revenue, not whether there's any oil

27:32.448 --> 27:34.490
there. But anyway,

27:34.510 --> 27:43.019
NSF is carrying much of the load now. I don't know 
whether it can continue, because the Congress is

27:43.079 --> 27:50.447
kind of concerned that the data should be applied 
immediately. And that's a poor way of operating,

27:51.408 --> 27:58.776
because if you run out of basic knowledge, then you 
can't begin to apply it there. And in a way, it's

27:59.853 --> 28:09.987
getting to where decisions about funding are kind 
of being based more on consensus than on

27:59.853 --> 28:09.987
principles. Einstein couldn't be funded.

28:16.256 --> 28:18.419
You see research then becoming more practical. 
More applied. More applied is a better word. And

28:21.783 --> 28:28.172
then the sort of basic R&D, having less... perhaps 
having less funding. But to illustrate what

28:32.453 --> 28:54.143
happens with the so-called applied research, 
BLM, Bureau of Land Management, requires

28:32.453 --> 28:54.143
so-called baseline surveys in the areas where oil 
is going to be developed in order to know whether,

28:32.453 --> 28:54.143
if there's a pollution, how much it changed the 
bottom, and mainly response to

28:54.460 --> 29:21.193
neo-environmentalist demands now the problem 
there is that there aren't enough biologists to

28:54.460 --> 29:21.193
make common studies of this samples can't be taken 
very close together it's the the value of it is zero

28:54.460 --> 29:21.193
in my opinion or a very tiny fraction of one percent 
above zero but the money going to that is

28:54.460 --> 29:21.193
tremendous but it's the there's little basic 
knowledge and the application is probably zero
