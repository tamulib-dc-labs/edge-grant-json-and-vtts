WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:05.466
Unscheduled afternoon and or an unscheduled night.

00:06.086 --> 00:06.707
What did you do?

00:12.173 --> 00:26.207
I Don't know that we had very many of those Most of the time you just sleep You go back to your room and sleep Yeah, you could uh-huh, but if they caught you well

00:27.082 --> 00:45.930
not catch you, but if the upperclassmen needed something done and you were asleep, well that didn't bother them that they would wake you up.

00:45.950 --> 00:53.241
Then in the evenings, if you didn't have a schedule, where did you go?

00:56.056 --> 01:01.682
during the week you would stay in your room unless you went to a library or something like that.

01:02.923 --> 01:05.306
You had to, we had to be in the room.

01:05.946 --> 01:11.732
Or with a pass posted.

01:12.513 --> 01:16.697
Describe the library for a student in that era.

01:17.098 --> 01:22.283
Describe it as a place to go.

01:25.216 --> 01:31.936
Most of us would, well my use of the library was not good.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.804
I would just go over there

01:35.037 --> 01:47.269
to get out of my room, to get out of the way of the upperclassmen, put my books on the table, maybe lean over and take a nap, but very seldom go and do any reference work at all.

01:47.289 --> 02:04.487
But just get away and sit there in your chair with a big table and do your homework and, or maybe visit with some others if you happen to see anyone else in there that you knew and after a while you got to

02:05.041 --> 02:12.049
seeing some others and you would kind of meet over there perhaps, but it was not an organized meeting place.

02:12.109 --> 02:33.193
But in the afternoon, most of the time you would have some sort of a lab and then the nighttime was when I would go over there quite a bit or in the morning time.

02:33.334 --> 02:34.575
In the afternoons I

02:35.129 --> 02:40.296
personally did not usually go to the library, but it was a

02:44.022 --> 02:45.163
sort of a refuge.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.206
Right, that's what I have heard.

02:48.226 --> 02:48.326
Yeah.

02:48.346 --> 02:54.572
And by and large, no one hazed, picked on anybody in the library.

02:54.712 --> 02:56.074
No, no, no.

02:57.095 --> 03:00.798
The library was essentially off limits for any of that.

03:02.040 --> 03:12.730
I would guess that sometimes an upperclassman would detail a freshman to go and do something for him, but it was essentially a refuge.

03:15.038 --> 03:27.693
All right, what about some during all of your years as a student can you think of some pranks or jokes or good bull that you heard of maybe you didn't participate in but you heard about that you could describe?

03:34.240 --> 03:43.611
Well, there was one prof, history I believe, Count Zegaroff.

03:45.262 --> 03:58.598
And my understanding that this happened to Paul Lowry, that Paul answered a question one time and, where did you get that answer?

03:58.738 --> 03:59.419
Out of the book.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.420
Throw the book out the window.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.584
So Paul did, threw the book out the window.

04:03.604 --> 04:13.075
And then we would, we had fish days in those, back in that era.

04:13.578 --> 04:19.308
in which the freshmen were essentially coming of age.

04:22.113 --> 04:35.417
And it was on April the 1st and he would essentially cut classes and go do all sorts of things.

04:36.848 --> 04:43.577
I know the group that I was with, Fish Day in 1937, we caught the train and went to Bryan.

04:44.338 --> 04:45.160
Didn't pay for it.

04:45.941 --> 04:47.182
Caught the train and came back.

04:47.303 --> 04:48.104
Didn't pay for it.

04:49.706 --> 04:57.617
And I guess roamed the streets in Bryan and imagined the cops were looking at us, but nothing ever happened.

05:04.366 --> 05:04.847
Let's see.

05:07.747 --> 05:09.389
Fish day.

05:09.469 --> 05:10.009
What was it?

05:10.029 --> 05:10.610
When was it?

05:11.231 --> 05:11.891
April 1st.

05:13.753 --> 05:14.034
Usually.

05:14.494 --> 05:18.718
And that was the day when you got out of fishdom.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.784
You could call upperclassmen by Bill Greenwall instead of Mr. Greenwall.

05:25.446 --> 05:32.573
And also it was

05:37.058 --> 05:37.919
Let's see.

05:37.939 --> 05:39.963
No, no, that's not when you got that.

05:41.084 --> 05:50.199
There was a beer bust when you got to do that, when you got to call him Mr. instead of Mr. Greenwall, Bill Greenwall.

05:51.902 --> 05:57.571
But Fish Day was campus-wide.

05:59.073 --> 06:04.602
Beer bust day would be by individual units.

06:07.737 --> 06:23.519
Well, another thing that would happen at times, being the room orderly, you had to make up the beds of the upperclassmen.

06:23.539 --> 06:28.306
And so you wouldn't dare short sheet him.

06:28.326 --> 06:35.195
But your friend would, and so you would arrange with your friend a short sheet.

06:35.756 --> 06:37.018
Mr. Greenwall.

06:37.977 --> 06:43.225
And he would go in and try to crawl into bed and get halfway in and that's all he could do.

06:43.285 --> 06:48.453
And then he would have to remake it or call his freshman, which he wasn't supposed to do, but he would.

06:49.454 --> 07:02.314
But I think short sheeting was one of the most common types of heckling that freshmen would do to their upperclassmen.

07:02.682 --> 07:08.512
But as I say, not to the one that you were rumored for, because he would really get with you then.

07:09.233 --> 07:21.593
But it was a... Did you all ever, you or any of your buddies, ever play a prank on another student when he was out on a big date?

07:24.217 --> 07:24.758
Oh...

07:27.337 --> 07:41.880
Well, those were on weekends usually when there was a big dance on campus because otherwise there were no girls around and there was no date to be had.

07:42.662 --> 07:54.120
But yeah, a couple of times that I remember the guy was thinking that he had a

07:55.147 --> 08:11.773
heavy date, hot date, good date, whatever, and you would give him a haircut or paint him with some mercurochrome, something like that.

08:19.145 --> 08:21.829
I think

08:23.615 --> 08:35.208
I remember someone, not me, mailed, a guy had a date to come down for, I don't know what, football game or a dance or something.

08:35.228 --> 08:46.922
And somebody else wrote him a letter to cancel the date, but sent it to Denton to be mailed back down here.

08:49.568 --> 08:51.071
He had two dates that weekend.

08:53.878 --> 08:56.403
He went out and got another date in the meantime.

08:56.764 --> 09:05.383
But talking about that for just a minute, Woody Warner.

09:06.798 --> 09:08.240
That's how he met his wife.

09:09.161 --> 09:25.243
She came down for a dance or a football weekend, I don't remember that, but from up there and Woody, that was the first time that Woody saw her or had a date with her and it ended up in marriage, happy marriage.

09:25.364 --> 09:30.070
Let's digress on Durwood T. Verner from Cottonwood, Texas.

09:30.431 --> 09:31.993
Describe him as a student.

09:33.956 --> 09:35.758
He was a very, very good student.

09:37.898 --> 09:40.301
What was it?

09:42.104 --> 09:50.797
Class president, cadet colonel, and captain of the basketball team.

09:50.817 --> 09:54.642
You know, just about everything that you could be.

09:56.245 --> 10:01.392
He was a good guy.

10:02.873 --> 10:13.309
We didn't have good basketball players, but he was a little bit above average of what we were, and we just had a good time playing basketball together.

10:13.970 --> 10:26.248
But he was a good, solid student, perhaps a little bit more serious than most.

10:27.730 --> 10:30.155
But we had a lot of serious people, though, really.

10:30.175 --> 10:37.609
But he was just an outstanding cadet, outstanding student, really, outstanding leader.

10:38.290 --> 10:41.296
And he was highly respected by you fellow students.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.881
Oh, yes, yes.

10:45.003 --> 10:50.413
I personally do not remember any adverse comments about Woody in any shape, form, or fashion.

10:52.621 --> 11:19.371
and he went on to a career great leadership at Michigan State and Nebraska I think is still with us in fragile health but I think he's still around let's see routine changes now for a sophomore describe what it was like to be an Aggie sophomore let me let me go back and one other experience as a freshman oh good one Saturday morning

11:20.988 --> 11:26.776
I decided that I was going to go home after classes, whatever.

11:28.157 --> 11:29.079
And I hitchhiked home.

11:29.599 --> 11:34.345
This was after Christmas.

11:36.448 --> 11:37.730
I went home Thanksgiving.

11:37.750 --> 11:38.631
I went home Christmas.

11:39.472 --> 11:45.780
And in February, I decided I'm going home.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.923
And I did not sign out with anybody.

11:48.190 --> 11:50.772
No one knew where I was at all.

11:51.433 --> 11:54.236
I was AWOL as far as they were concerned here.

11:56.118 --> 11:59.421
I went home, and that's the night that my father died.

12:02.784 --> 12:14.215
And my friend Milton Ray that I'd mentioned earlier happened to be home also that weekend, and he came out and saw me, and I asked him to tell the people in F Battery where I was.

12:15.196 --> 12:16.577
And when I came back,

12:17.317 --> 12:25.524
I did not undergo any hazing, any questioning, any chewing out of any fashion because I knew what the story was.

12:26.125 --> 12:30.488
But I took out and I went home.

12:30.869 --> 12:33.871
Did you know he was in danger when you left?

12:33.891 --> 12:34.872
No, no.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.714
He was in ill health.

12:36.754 --> 12:43.460
He had been in poor health, I should say, for several years, two or three.

12:43.480 --> 12:47.323
But there was no prognosis of any.

12:47.303 --> 12:50.787
demise in the near future or anything like that.

12:50.807 --> 12:51.689
I just went home.

12:52.850 --> 12:53.311
Let's see.

12:53.811 --> 12:57.115
That leads me to, we'll postpone this sophomore for a second.

12:58.377 --> 13:03.403
As far as you can recall, what did that first year cost financially?

13:03.463 --> 13:04.705
What did you bring with you?

13:04.905 --> 13:05.806
I don't remember.

13:06.767 --> 13:07.448
I really don't.

13:07.789 --> 13:08.910
How much money did you bring?

13:08.930 --> 13:09.371
Do you remember?

13:09.471 --> 13:11.934
It wasn't very much.

13:12.995 --> 13:16.720
I would imagine I've tried to

13:17.527 --> 13:19.271
reconstruct this, I just don't know.

13:19.391 --> 13:27.610
But I would imagine that Daddy gave me a check payable to A&M for room, board, tuition, whatever, for that first semester.

13:29.053 --> 13:30.677
And where he got the money, I don't know.

13:31.138 --> 13:33.784
Did you have any spending money that you had saved?

13:35.026 --> 13:37.071
I didn't have any income to save.

13:37.439 --> 13:43.587
On the farm it just was not anything like that.

13:44.048 --> 13:46.211
I'm sure that they gave me a dollar or something.

13:46.832 --> 13:47.913
I don't know.

13:48.093 --> 13:59.008
I just don't remember anything because I just, I would imagine that my freshman year

13:59.343 --> 14:05.811
I might have bought maybe five Cokes, cherry Cokes or something like that over at Casey's.

14:06.933 --> 14:14.422
But I just didn't go anywhere that needed money.

14:15.444 --> 14:17.987
Describe what it was like to become a sophomore.

14:18.007 --> 14:19.349
How did life change?

14:21.592 --> 14:26.498
I didn't have to put those passes on my door to get out at night.

14:30.359 --> 14:50.928
What is that dorm over there by Cebiza that is now changed to an office building, that old dorm immediately on the southeast corner of Cebiza and across from the registrar's office and so on, whatever building that is, that's where we were.

14:52.510 --> 14:59.961
And it was just essentially a period of emancipation from the

15:01.257 --> 15:05.963
rather tight discipline, if you want to call it that, that freshman undergo.

15:07.525 --> 15:13.693
I had a room orderly which helped, and I didn't have to clean up any upper-classmen's room.

15:19.561 --> 15:23.947
But I was still a sophomore and not an upper-classman.

15:23.967 --> 15:30.015
You had sophomores and then you had upper-classmen, and those didn't mix.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.892
at least not an F battery.

15:34.353 --> 15:37.657
And so you had freshmen, you had sophomores, and you had upperclassmen.

15:38.618 --> 15:45.206
So you still were not completely free.

15:45.226 --> 15:49.430
How did being an upperclassman then change you?

15:49.450 --> 15:52.654
Oh man, you could go your own way.

15:53.575 --> 16:00.643
It was, you know, you get to wear the other uniform and it just,

16:02.665 --> 16:10.918
There's just a lot more freedom as an upperclassman as opposed to a sophomore and definitely as a freshman.

16:10.938 --> 16:12.040
Let's see.

16:13.382 --> 16:16.787
Classroom behavior.

16:17.428 --> 16:20.774
How did you and your buddies behave in class?

16:22.617 --> 16:30.529
Most of the time you strictly behaved, but I was sort of dependent on the prof too.

16:31.319 --> 16:38.527
Like that Count Cigars throw the book out the window and apparently Paul did and that kind of broke up the class.

16:39.768 --> 16:41.029
But there are others.

16:41.690 --> 16:43.872
Mr. Tom Leland, head of accounting.

16:45.394 --> 16:46.335
He was Mr. Leland.

16:48.056 --> 16:51.340
And you respected Mr. Leland too.

16:51.360 --> 16:57.887
But you really didn't joke around much in his classes at all.

16:57.907 --> 17:01.090
Except one time.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.588
I'll tell it anyway.

17:07.451 --> 17:14.298
Jim Thomason, football player, was an accounting.

17:14.318 --> 17:16.981
And one of the classes was Mr. Leland.

17:18.263 --> 17:24.670
Jim for some reason wasn't giving him the right answers or something about what Mr. Leland was trying to get at.

17:26.172 --> 17:27.313
Mr. Thomason,

17:28.002 --> 17:30.266
you're not going into public accounting, are you?

17:32.149 --> 17:34.753
And that kind of broke the class up.

17:35.354 --> 17:43.427
But that's also the only time that I ever heard Mr. Leland kind of chide somebody.

17:44.529 --> 17:52.963
But we never came in and marked on the blackboards or anything like that.

17:55.677 --> 18:01.783
And I really don't think went to sleep much in class.

18:05.186 --> 18:06.528
Did you attend class regularly?

18:07.308 --> 18:08.670
Oh, yes.

18:10.812 --> 18:13.294
We were authorized three cuts.

18:15.216 --> 18:20.922
But if you got more than that, you usually got a cut down on your grade.

18:22.163 --> 18:25.566
But I also go back and one other comment about that.

18:25.883 --> 18:31.933
certain people at times could get excused for some absences.

18:31.953 --> 18:34.076
And I mentioned Bill Greenwald.

18:34.096 --> 18:36.099
He's now deceased.

18:36.119 --> 18:44.212
But his senior year, he decided to go see his girlfriend up in Hope, Arkansas.

18:44.232 --> 18:49.821
And he took off and went and came back and got excused absences.

18:49.841 --> 18:52.165
And he took them to all of his profs.

18:52.566 --> 18:53.427
And one of them said,

18:54.233 --> 18:57.418
Mr. Greenwald, yes.

18:57.438 --> 18:59.621
I recognize this excused absence.

19:01.704 --> 19:03.166
And you missed an exam.

19:04.809 --> 19:09.215
And this, to make up for it, is a take-home exam.

19:10.477 --> 19:12.059
You have 24 hours.

19:13.021 --> 19:22.755
You can use any book you want out of your own library, out of a big library, wherever you want, and you're not going to pass a quiz.

19:25.823 --> 19:29.109
And he didn't.

19:35.540 --> 19:39.167
We would essentially attend class.

19:39.227 --> 19:49.485
Maybe sometimes on a Saturday morning you might cut class if the train was coming in and your date was on it, but most of the time not.

19:49.550 --> 20:15.692
who who were some of the memorable teachers memorable for whatever reason and if you can their nicknames and so forth what I had a wine a key in or something like that I can't quite pull it back right now in accounting and he taught

20:18.085 --> 20:19.868
junior accounting as I remember it.

20:22.912 --> 20:24.975
I don't remember the nickname we had for him.

20:25.015 --> 20:44.363
Maybe I couldn't tell it on tape if we did, but he was a stickler and you kind of hated him almost, but in the end also you respected him.

20:44.663 --> 20:47.826
I never did really have nicknames.

20:47.846 --> 20:56.535
Now, for some of them around, there were two in bullet text, in ROTC.

20:58.157 --> 21:04.444
Colonel Beasley was the head field artillery instructor, and he was Colonel Beepo.

21:05.585 --> 21:07.607
He had sort of a high, squeaky voice.

21:09.509 --> 21:13.573
And then there was another one, Dapper Dan.

21:15.359 --> 21:40.624
I think he was a captain, but, and I can't place a last name with him, but one time Colonel Beepo, in those days we had, in the field artillery, we had mounted batteries, we were horse drawn, and the F battery was one of the three that were, was a horse drawn battery, and it was for a,

21:41.650 --> 21:44.674
review for President Roosevelt when he came down here.

21:45.155 --> 21:51.003
And I don't know for sure whether it's in 38, 39 or 39, 40 era.

21:51.023 --> 21:52.925
But it was one of those two years.

21:54.087 --> 22:01.336
And F battery was the, to be the mounted battery for that review.

22:01.537 --> 22:07.845
And as they started around, along came a train with the big whistles.

22:07.865 --> 22:11.270
And I think the whistles in those days were stronger than they are now.

22:11.430 --> 22:11.590
And

22:12.025 --> 22:16.250
And that scared, I don't remember, there was one or two of the sets of teams.

22:16.270 --> 22:18.833
And they ran.

22:18.853 --> 22:25.642
And Henry Herter was, again, depending upon which year it was, either the first sergeant or the battery commander.

22:26.803 --> 22:30.948
And he went racing on his horse to Colonel Beasley.

22:31.869 --> 22:33.471
What to do, Colonel, what to do?

22:34.553 --> 22:36.535
Take him around again, Mr. Herter.

22:36.815 --> 22:38.117
Take him around again.

22:39.008 --> 22:41.410
And that was in that high, squeaky voice.

22:41.510 --> 22:47.636
And Henry said he can still remember that squeaky voice even now.

22:49.097 --> 22:56.625
But Colonel Beepo and Dapper Dan, that Dapper Dan might have been Captain Elwood.

22:56.665 --> 22:57.666
I'm not quite sure.

22:57.746 --> 23:04.392
But of course, there was always Bear Tracks Bolton.

23:04.412 --> 23:05.012
But I didn't.

23:05.052 --> 23:06.234
Why was he called Bear Tracks?

23:06.534 --> 23:06.974
I don't know.

23:07.935 --> 23:08.796
Did he have big feet?

23:09.586 --> 23:10.868
I think so.

23:10.888 --> 23:11.850
I was lucky.

23:11.870 --> 23:13.252
I never had to go into his office.

23:14.074 --> 23:21.126
He was, what, vice president of the college or something like that.

23:21.326 --> 23:27.156
At that time he was, I think, even up out of engineering.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.786
And I never had to go to his office.

23:31.827 --> 23:40.356
And I didn't want to go to his office because I heard some people that had been, and he could be gruff.

23:41.778 --> 23:45.982
And then a graduate student, Satch Elkins.

23:47.884 --> 23:52.669
And as I remembered, the reason for the name Satch is because of a satchel butt.

23:52.729 --> 23:54.712
It seemed to kind of hang down.

23:55.152 --> 23:57.835
It wasn't because he was carrying a satchel in his hand.

23:58.658 --> 24:24.919
more related to his butt and uh i didn't i didn't have satch in anything i don't believe what about english anybody with i don't memorable characters uh were there some uh advisors who'd you who did you turn to for advice all right let me go back oh one um not that um

24:28.173 --> 24:32.759
It was freshman chemistry.

24:32.779 --> 24:33.841
I had Dr. Harrington.

24:36.905 --> 24:44.715
And he gave me a vial of pure water.

24:44.735 --> 24:51.244
And I tested it for everything and I never thought about water.

24:52.017 --> 24:56.744
And yeah, I flunked it, but that, anyway.

24:56.764 --> 25:01.051
And describe him as a teacher, M.T.

25:01.071 --> 25:01.511
Harrington.

25:04.776 --> 25:20.640
As I remember it, he was very thorough, but a very demanding person at that time, and had no hesitancy about flunking anybody.

25:20.924 --> 25:28.356
And I say that because he was a classmate of my oldest brother, and I flunked it.

25:28.376 --> 25:36.408
And I don't know whether he knew my relationship or not, but I feel sure they would not have made any difference to him.

25:36.428 --> 25:48.467
But he was really a fair teacher, fair, equal, but a good, thorough, and

25:50.152 --> 25:55.379
For those who had a good preparation for it from high school, I think that they would do very good.

25:55.479 --> 26:02.008
I did not have a good science background in high school.

26:02.028 --> 26:14.165
Let's see, who were some of the celebrity students, the students that, there were some football players here and so forth, who were some others other than Woody Varner who were well-known students?

26:14.826 --> 26:16.108
Describe them.

26:18.603 --> 26:31.359
There was a Tom Ritchie and Bill Becker that were leaders almost from the start.

26:32.340 --> 26:42.172
Tom was president of the senior class and Bill Becker was cadet colonel.

26:44.755 --> 26:46.517
And they had been leaders

26:48.050 --> 26:53.356
throughout and Tom stayed in the Army.

26:53.416 --> 27:08.914
I don't know exactly when he retired but he was out in Arizona and he decided to run for office and he opposed Barry Goldwater and barely lost as I understand it from out there.

27:11.336 --> 27:11.897
Becker

27:13.750 --> 27:20.297
Well, I believe he was also elected editor of the Longhorn.

27:20.317 --> 27:29.547
But when he was made cadet colonel, he had to, I don't know whether he had to, but anyway, he did give up the Longhorn editorship.

27:30.669 --> 27:36.535
But Bill received a regular Army commission.

27:38.658 --> 27:51.099
and stayed in the Army and retired as a Major General from the Office of Legislative Liaison for the Department of the Army, liaison over to the Capitol Hill.

27:55.767 --> 27:58.692
Somewhere along in here also, I believe a year earlier,

28:00.022 --> 28:06.632
When I say a year earlier, a year earlier than I graduated, when I should have graduated, I did not graduate until 41.

28:07.574 --> 28:14.405
But George Mitchell was here on campus at that time.

28:14.425 --> 28:19.633
And most of the time he was known as Greek Mitchell.

28:20.778 --> 28:25.784
I wouldn't call him that now, but that was what it was back in those days.

28:26.345 --> 28:31.331
It's the man who went on to be developer, industrialist in Galveston and Houston.

28:31.351 --> 28:35.515
Yes, and the oil and gas part.

28:36.997 --> 28:45.988
And another one that was a leader, too, was on the football squad, Howard Shelton.

28:46.008 --> 28:48.591
And he went on...

28:49.280 --> 28:52.017
to be president of a bank up in Fort Worth.

28:53.380 --> 28:58.805
Of course, Pete Wainer, I can't miss him.

28:59.365 --> 29:05.891
He was in accounting with me and we studied together in certain places known as Mutt and Jeff.

29:06.371 --> 29:21.885
But Pete became the managing partner of the Houston office for Anderson Clayton and was also chairman of the board of that Welch Foundation, something like that anyway, which

29:21.865 --> 29:29.438
ultimately gave, I'd say, considerable monies to A&M for research purposes.

29:29.458 --> 29:31.181
What about some of those football stars?

29:31.201 --> 29:33.785
Describe them as your fellow students.

29:36.270 --> 29:41.318
Well, Jim Thomason, you're not going into public accounting, are you, Mr. Thomason?

29:43.362 --> 29:44.484
What about John Kimbrough?

29:45.245 --> 29:47.569
I did not really know him much.

29:49.102 --> 29:59.879
Back a little earlier, there was a Marshall Rob Nett, and I wouldn't want to be caught in a back alley with him, even if he knew that I was an Aggie.

30:01.401 --> 30:02.843
He was a so-and-so.

30:03.905 --> 30:13.520
I went out for football one day here as a walk-on, and they didn't have a uniform small enough for me.

30:13.540 --> 30:16.645
And the guy that was, and I was going out for tackle,

30:17.317 --> 30:27.830
and a guy that was tackled with Joe Boyd, later All-American, and an evangelist of some renown.

30:29.332 --> 30:34.538
There was another guy, Jack Cooper, baseball player.

30:36.481 --> 30:41.367
Jack was on the freshman football team here.

30:43.608 --> 30:53.997
And I happened to be at that, that was a year that I was out of school or going back to Forney for postgraduate work.

30:54.518 --> 30:58.241
And I was down here for that freshman Longhorn football game.

31:00.864 --> 31:12.214
And I don't know the reason for the downs to be replayed, but Jack punted out of bounds three consecutive plays.
