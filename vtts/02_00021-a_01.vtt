WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:04.352
That was really incredible.

00:04.553 --> 00:07.156
I was amazed.

00:07.757 --> 00:12.743
I mean, great response for the program, obviously, but they were just incredible.

00:12.904 --> 00:16.608
Just really, really wonderful people.

00:16.889 --> 00:30.747
I think they enjoyed spending the time with the students, and it was really interesting to be able to try to, for Wiley, to be able to manage that kind of

00:30.727 --> 00:33.334
you know, having those kinds of celebrities on campus.

00:33.414 --> 00:39.612
But that was a pretty good year to have a sitting vice president on campus and two former presidents on campus.

00:40.133 --> 00:42.420
Any other celebrities during that year that you remember?

00:42.881 --> 00:44.365
Let's see.

00:47.939 --> 00:49.662
I was trying to remember some of the concerts.

00:50.904 --> 01:01.541
Huey Lewis and the News was the big, was one of the biggest concerts we did under our new promoter, promoter contracts for a town hall.

01:02.182 --> 01:03.665
And that was just, that was incredible.

01:03.785 --> 01:06.289
I mean, just a great, great concert.

01:07.752 --> 01:10.236
It went off without any problems.

01:11.017 --> 01:12.900
And,

01:12.880 --> 01:17.547
That year was just, it seemed like just a bang up year.

01:17.587 --> 01:30.467
All of the committees did well and the few that we, we did end up reducing the number of committees, but I think that even the tough decisions we made

01:30.903 --> 01:51.375
I think the way we made them, the way we handled them, and it was really wonderful, particularly because Jim really did let the student leaders lead and put us in our, I think he challenged us in a couple of occasions where we had to

01:51.355 --> 02:10.866
we had to really work in some cases to deliver not so pleasant news and to make some pretty tough decisions about things and then be able to communicate those to others and even to, I had a real strong

02:10.846 --> 02:24.469
real tough conversation with the two individuals that were leading the Miss Texas A&M pageant and basically said, you've got X number of days to clean up the act.

02:24.489 --> 02:31.221
If not, then my plan is to call the performance review committee and have you all removed from office.

02:31.922 --> 02:32.483
It was

02:32.463 --> 02:52.767
That was tough to do, particularly because they're friends, they were friends, but we had to make it clear to them that all the things that we were hearing about the treatment of the contestants and about all the other things that happened, including their relationship with their staff advisor, was just unacceptable.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.368
And did they make the changes?

02:54.769 --> 02:55.370
Did.

02:55.390 --> 02:55.570
Oh, okay.

02:55.590 --> 02:55.770
Did.

02:56.651 --> 02:59.094
And I think it was for the better.

02:59.174 --> 03:01.476
I mean, it was a turnaround.

03:01.496 --> 03:04.179
Their relationship with their advisor turned around.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.923
Their relationship with the contestants turned around.

03:06.943 --> 03:09.165
I think the pageant went off without a hitch.

03:09.666 --> 03:16.273
I think their ability to raise funds, the ability to focus on getting positive things done rather than everything else that was

03:16.253 --> 03:19.938
distracting for them in the organization went away.

03:19.979 --> 03:20.780
Those things went away.

03:21.040 --> 03:28.651
It wasn't completely clean, but I think by far it could have been a disaster for us.

03:31.235 --> 03:43.273
Tim Fitzgibbon, who was the EVP for programs, did I think a great job of keeping those kinds of things on track.

03:44.401 --> 03:52.622
I've always wished, I want to see if I can find an idea, I've always wished that somewhere we had almost an autograph display

03:53.260 --> 03:57.284
of the notable people that have been here, particularly MSC.

03:58.045 --> 04:08.134
Van Clyburn was our first performer in the Rudder Auditorium.

04:08.154 --> 04:11.618
And think of the musicians, the speakers, the pop.

04:11.638 --> 04:18.424
Yeah, I remember also Itzhak Perlman and the, one of the Opus programs, Itzhak Perlman and the St.

04:18.464 --> 04:19.145
Louis Symphony.

04:19.305 --> 04:20.466
Just incredible.

04:20.547 --> 04:21.729
Sure.

04:21.909 --> 04:36.631
And if we somewhere had those signatures and the dates so that you and I as incoming freshmen would see it, my goodness, because I think it would be kind of like a who's who.

04:37.733 --> 04:40.537
Why couldn't we start that somewhere?

04:40.557 --> 04:44.783
Oh, I think that would just be incredible.

04:46.973 --> 04:59.567
still amazed at, even after years of being an MSC-er, still amazed at the quality of the programming that happens.

04:59.968 --> 05:03.177
And I think that would be just tremendous.

05:03.730 --> 05:18.494
You know, it's really interesting when we go on recruiting trips now, and I've been lucky to participate in some of them, and have the MSC talk about, particularly Will Hurd, talk about, you know, some of the programs that they produced, and have students go, wow.

05:18.714 --> 05:22.781
I mean, have those respective, or those recruits go, wow, I can't believe it.

05:22.841 --> 05:25.886
I mean, it's just, it would just be incredible.

05:25.906 --> 05:30.193
And see, Van Claiborne was the first performer, but the first person

05:30.595 --> 05:35.021
to appear on that stage about three nights earlier was Jacques Cousteau.

05:35.682 --> 05:36.003
Oh.

05:36.023 --> 05:42.272
Because we had him scheduled over in the chemistry building and they got through a week early with the MSC.

05:42.292 --> 05:46.858
So we said, well, we'll just move it over and we'll check how everything works.

05:46.878 --> 05:51.505
And it was a, we had it half full at least.

05:51.725 --> 05:54.108
It was a superb evening.

05:54.129 --> 05:58.695
And then I remember Jacques, then when Van Claiborne came, he walked in

05:59.148 --> 06:07.872
and clapped his hands to check the acoustics and said something to the effect that I believe this is the best acoustical hall I've ever performed in.

06:09.155 --> 06:10.238
Things like that.

06:10.960 --> 06:16.047
Now let's see, this is your fifth year and you're majoring in?

06:16.067 --> 06:17.148
I'm majoring in sociology.

06:17.188 --> 06:19.151
Sociology.

06:19.171 --> 06:25.299
And describe during that year a typical day of classes.

06:25.920 --> 06:33.489
Oh gosh, I usually started out my morning at 7.30 in the office, at the student programs office.

06:34.611 --> 06:39.297
And so generally I would, and by then I was, I could do nine o'clock classes.

06:39.277 --> 06:43.063
So I was generally in the office from about 7.30 until about 8.45.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.986
I mean, yeah, about 8.45.

06:45.026 --> 06:46.168
So I'd leave and go to class.

06:46.609 --> 06:50.836
And I was generally gone to class most of the morning, come back.

06:51.477 --> 06:59.970
I would come back at lunch and generally have lunch down in the cafeteria and then have class early afternoon.

07:00.010 --> 07:01.753
But I was generally done by 2.

07:03.055 --> 07:05.419
And so I would go back to the SPO.

07:05.399 --> 07:13.176
and spend from about two to five or two to six in the SPO if there were no meetings, if there were meetings.

07:13.216 --> 07:13.918
The student programs office?

07:14.238 --> 07:17.305
Right, yeah, student programs office and the office there.

07:17.706 --> 07:23.779
And so it was very long days, and if there was a program that night,

07:24.232 --> 07:28.901
I generally would not go home, so I'd bring clothes with me to change to go to the program.

07:30.423 --> 07:38.899
One of the things I did with the leadership group or the executive team is we wanted

07:39.200 --> 07:43.868
We wanted to be visible at not just the major programs.

07:44.069 --> 07:54.267
We all got invitations to Opus and to Wiley, but we wanted to show up at those programs where committee members just didn't expect us to show up.

07:54.367 --> 07:59.115
Not because we wanted to check on it, but we wanted them to know that we had an appreciation

07:59.382 --> 08:02.425
for how hard they had worked on that program.

08:02.485 --> 08:05.889
So we divided up, we spent a lot of time dividing up our list.

08:06.690 --> 08:13.497
In fact, a lot of the things that I had invitations to that maybe the others did not, I would share.

08:15.179 --> 08:22.487
So I asked them to kind of share the load with me, particularly in terms of the public appearances things.

08:22.467 --> 08:38.805
and so we did that and and that that took a lot of time so we were we had lots of programs to go to um i remember spending and i was this was such such good for me so good for me i remember spending

08:39.595 --> 08:48.229
just about a full Saturday with Nova when they do their big war con.

08:48.249 --> 08:50.071
And I was just amazed.

08:50.292 --> 08:51.814
I could not believe.

08:51.834 --> 08:57.503
I mean, you walk into this room and there's this huge, huge,

08:59.052 --> 09:03.937
literally kind of a city or a couple of cities that are built and there's this war going on.

09:04.698 --> 09:07.701
I just, just unbelievable.

09:08.002 --> 09:17.412
I just could not, I never fathom, could fathom that people were that intelligent and would do these incredible things with war games.

09:18.072 --> 09:22.377
And Seven Variables the same kind of way when they did the big Star Trek deal.

09:22.357 --> 09:25.025
And that was just, you know, have all the Trekkies in town.

09:25.205 --> 09:26.950
And I'm a Trekkie.

09:27.452 --> 09:33.409
And so probably not as dedicated as some of the others, but that was really neat.

09:33.429 --> 09:34.332
That was really neat.

09:34.352 --> 09:37.260
All right, now earlier I asked you about typical student dress.

09:37.713 --> 09:44.622
What was typical student dress for the MSC Council President during that year, during the day?

09:44.642 --> 09:48.026
Okay, that changed because I didn't wear jeans as much.

09:48.907 --> 09:55.235
So lots of slacks and lots of polo shirts.

09:56.717 --> 09:58.279
Then some, not very many t-shirts.

09:59.601 --> 10:02.404
Because what would happen a lot of times is,

10:02.384 --> 10:20.509
is if I were in the office, particularly if I had come to the office around lunchtime, and if we had a potential contributor or Jim had a special guest, it was quite often that you'd get asked to lunch to help host somebody.

10:21.190 --> 10:28.560
So I always liked to at least dress a little bit more prepared and wouldn't scare other folks off.

10:28.540 --> 10:41.680
But I generally carried a jacket and a tie with me or a suit with me so that I could change to go to events and stuff.

10:41.700 --> 10:45.867
So the hours became much longer.

10:46.568 --> 10:51.055
Did you have any experiences that you feel comfortable in sharing?

10:51.693 --> 11:02.333
where somebody in a supposed position of authority outside the MSC attempted to tell you what the MSC council ought to be doing or not doing.

11:03.154 --> 11:08.284
Did any board member, legislator, supposedly powerful Aggie,

11:09.428 --> 11:13.713
No, we didn't have that at all.

11:14.914 --> 11:20.461
We began to have the discussions then about the MSC expansion.

11:21.842 --> 11:29.611
And in fact, that was my first opportunity to meet Robert Smith, who was then, I believe he was associate VP.

11:31.593 --> 11:35.858
The student leaders had a pretty good relationship

11:36.310 --> 12:00.262
what I call the big four, the core commander, the student body president, the MSC president, and the RHA president, had a pretty good relationship with the administration, but we also got an opportunity to meet more regularly with the other VPs than did our predecessors.

12:01.083 --> 12:04.427
For instance, I don't think they ever, or they met once with Eddie Joe Davis,

12:04.407 --> 12:09.196
But we met fairly regularly with Eddie Joe Davis, who was the VP for Fiscal Affairs then.

12:10.077 --> 12:20.617
And so as we started talking about the MSC expansion, and as the committee, the user group was getting formed, we formed our own user group in-house.

12:20.717 --> 12:22.821
And so there was a great deal of debate

12:22.801 --> 12:31.937
about the MSC's role in the arts and that, you know, the MSC shouldn't necessarily control the art exhibits on campus.

12:31.977 --> 12:37.266
That really ought to rest with the College of Liberal Arts and hoping that we have a fine arts program.

12:37.668 --> 12:44.656
That's when Mr. Runyon decided to give his gift.

12:44.676 --> 12:51.483
And we were very disappointed that Dr. Vandiver at that time decided to give it to the College of Liberal Arts.

12:54.507 --> 12:58.651
But I now have an appreciation for why he did that.

12:58.671 --> 13:04.738
That would have been the beginning of what he saw as eventually a College of Fine Arts.

13:05.410 --> 13:09.335
And so I can appreciate his reasoning.

13:09.675 --> 13:11.036
So we were disappointed.

13:11.077 --> 13:27.115
I remember though, being in this meeting with Bill McKenzie, John Lindsey, let's see, Jim Reynolds,

13:29.069 --> 13:35.317
And there was someone else in the meeting, and we spent a great deal of time talking about that decision.

13:35.938 --> 13:48.495
The decision had not been made, but how do we build our case for the arts program, particularly that gift, to stay here and for primary responsibility for the gift.

13:48.475 --> 13:50.057
to be given to the MSC.

13:50.078 --> 13:52.842
And we spent a lot of time talking about that in that meeting.

13:53.022 --> 14:05.742
And then they left to go over to talk to President Vandiver at that time about it and came back disappointed that he had made a decision to have liberal arts coordinated.

14:05.722 --> 14:07.885
How did you become queen of John Lindsay?

14:08.506 --> 14:08.906
Let's see.

14:09.467 --> 14:10.068
Through the MSC.

14:10.849 --> 14:16.536
Mr. Lindsay was on the MSC Enrichment Fund Board, which was our fundraising group.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.821
And so I got a chance to meet, in fact, most of the regents.

14:21.542 --> 14:26.909
I also worked for the Board of Regents as a student worker.

14:28.431 --> 14:29.052
During that year?

14:30.033 --> 14:32.877
So that's why I got to know Bill McKenzie.

14:32.857 --> 14:36.420
And Larry Mays, I believe Larry Mays may have been in that meeting also.

14:37.301 --> 14:38.542
I can't remember all of them.

14:39.003 --> 14:52.675
Based on that very modest exposure to the board, which board members do you think at that point were the most influential with their colleagues?

14:52.735 --> 14:53.076
Let's see.

14:54.257 --> 14:56.619
Bill McKenzie, no doubt.

14:57.300 --> 14:57.820
Let's see.

14:58.521 --> 15:00.863
And this would have been my senior year.

15:01.523 --> 15:02.104
Let's see.

15:06.117 --> 15:07.080
Royce Weisenbaker.

15:08.363 --> 15:14.279
He chaired the powerful building and facilities planning and construction committee.

15:14.299 --> 15:19.654
And so the board members really did turn to him a lot.

15:23.279 --> 15:24.121
John Mobley.

15:25.804 --> 15:35.100
John Mobley was very quiet, but I thought his influence came in a different way.

15:36.182 --> 15:38.907
And I believe Larry Mays.

15:39.829 --> 15:42.874
Mr. Mays

15:42.854 --> 15:53.388
He was probably closer to the governor at that point than a lot of the other regents, because that would have been when Mark White was governor.

15:53.708 --> 16:02.040
And that changed when Clements was elected, but that's how I saw it.

16:02.720 --> 16:07.647
As MSC Council President, to whom did you turn for advice?

16:08.622 --> 16:11.308
Jim Reynolds quite often.

16:12.310 --> 16:19.367
Share with us examples of advice he gave you that you now realize was even more important maybe than you did at that time.

16:21.491 --> 16:26.142
Jim would often ask about what classes I was taking in.

16:28.113 --> 16:31.458
He wondered why I was a sociology major.

16:31.478 --> 16:33.882
And I told him I just, I mean, I like the study.

16:33.902 --> 16:35.605
I mean, I just, I like the feel.

16:36.366 --> 16:43.757
But what he did was he wanted me, he tried to encourage me to take some additional business classes.

16:43.777 --> 16:48.805
And he said, you probably ought to take some engineering, a couple of engineering courses too while you can.

16:48.785 --> 17:02.457
And I think because what he wanted to have happen was he thought that some technical skills in a particular area, whether it's accounting or some engineering,

17:03.719 --> 17:05.482
class would have been helpful.

17:05.502 --> 17:11.533
Now, I did not take his advice on the engineering, but I did take his advice on the accounting.

17:11.833 --> 17:16.141
But he wanted me to do much more accounting and finance related things.

17:16.161 --> 17:24.756
I guess he kind of figured that if I had a great desire and had a great passion for it, then I probably ought to bone up.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.280
Well, as it turns out,

17:27.547 --> 17:41.342
I'm in that role now, but what I did was I ended up spending time at one of my jobs as an oil and gas auditor, doing oil and gas auditing.

17:41.363 --> 17:44.290
So fortunately, I got to take some additional kinds of

17:44.270 --> 17:54.787
classes, short courses, and some professional development seminars in that area in accounting and finance.

17:54.807 --> 18:03.240
And so that made the transition to do the auditing work easier, and obviously it's been beneficial to me in my role here now.

18:03.220 --> 18:04.943
So that was good advice.

18:06.566 --> 18:20.149
He gave me also some good advice as we were trying to deal with that big program with the, I could not understand why, for the life of, with the politicians, I could not understand why

18:20.129 --> 18:39.032
we were being criticized, and it angered me that there was this perception out there that this program was handed to us, ready to go, and that the students, so I was angry that the students didn't get credit for the conception, for the planning,

18:39.012 --> 18:42.476
and for the execution that they deserved.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.698
And so that bothered me, and I could not understand that.

18:45.139 --> 18:51.726
And Jim was, you know, kept telling me that, well, just, you can't let that keep you off track.

18:51.746 --> 18:53.929
You can't let it demotivate you.

18:53.949 --> 18:56.932
You can't let it get you down.

18:56.972 --> 18:58.093
Just keep going forward.

18:58.594 --> 18:59.815
We'll keep saying it.

18:59.875 --> 19:03.940
And Bobby, sometimes, no matter how hard and how many folks you tell,

19:03.920 --> 19:06.905
Sometimes the message doesn't ring.

19:06.925 --> 19:08.368
He said, but just give it time.

19:08.388 --> 19:09.089
Just give it time.

19:09.249 --> 19:28.864
And as it turns out, eventually all the criticism went away and the focus on everybody else except for the committees and those students, student leaders who worked so hard, student volunteers who worked so hard on their program, I think people really did a little later on appreciate them.

19:29.722 --> 19:33.808
Now, his predecessor, Wayne Stark, had a technique.

19:33.828 --> 19:45.346
If he thought that things weren't going well and or a student wasn't doing his best, he'd get them, put them on an old green vinyl couch and give them a lecture called Green Couch Treatment.

19:45.406 --> 19:46.107
Right.

19:46.127 --> 19:51.055
Did the current director of the MSC, does he have anything like that?

19:54.342 --> 19:55.784
I don't remember that.

19:56.645 --> 20:04.253
Really, the green couch conversation that I had with Jim was really about as I was trying to decide about being a candidate.

20:06.456 --> 20:18.730
There was a ritual that, even though Mr. Stark was no longer the director, that every MSC president

20:18.710 --> 20:26.643
shortly after being selected, needed to go down and spend a couple hours with him.

20:26.663 --> 20:28.967
And in fact, I did.

20:32.533 --> 20:38.322
He talked about expectations, he cited a lot of examples about

20:39.213 --> 20:45.505
and shared a lot of advice about what he had given other students and how they had taken it or not taken it.

20:45.565 --> 20:52.699
For instance, Henry Cisneros, when he told Henry Cisneros not to go into politics until he made money.

20:52.966 --> 20:58.051
And he said, by God, then Henry just jumped out there and got into politics, and now he's wanting to make some money.

20:59.353 --> 21:02.036
So just those things.

21:02.256 --> 21:13.528
He was also asking me about, that was, he and Jim were the first ones to raise the issue with me of graduate school, graduate school or law school.

21:13.908 --> 21:15.830
Jim was really encouraging me to do law school.

21:17.252 --> 21:21.336
And I just did not want to do law school.

21:21.316 --> 21:25.483
He kept saying, no, you got to talk to people.

21:25.503 --> 21:26.625
You don't have to practice law.

21:26.766 --> 21:28.989
You know, you can do other things with it.

21:29.009 --> 21:32.556
Now hindsight, and Mr. Stark did the same thing.

21:32.576 --> 21:34.639
I probably should have done that when I had the opportunity.

21:35.641 --> 21:38.366
And I just, it just, it just missed me.

21:38.386 --> 21:40.810
So, but, you know,

21:40.790 --> 21:50.125
But nonetheless, I do recognize now the value of an advanced degree and how critical that's going to be for me now.

21:50.165 --> 21:53.690
So that's why I'm, in fact, in graduate school now, working on that.

21:53.790 --> 21:54.812
In what?

21:54.852 --> 21:55.974
In educational administration.

21:57.596 --> 22:01.102
Focus on finance and administration, finance and operations.

22:01.142 --> 22:02.985
And I'm having a good time.

22:03.005 --> 22:03.545
Having a good time.

22:03.946 --> 22:06.510
Another suggestion.

22:07.300 --> 22:28.667
What could you all arrange, you as a former council president and now a key staff member in the MSC, what could you all arrange to bring back to the campus a sampling of former student body presidents,

22:29.170 --> 22:48.141
Corps commanders, MSC Council, and what is it, RHA, to let some of those people from a variety of years share with next year's leaders to say, here's some of the things that we learned.

22:48.509 --> 22:55.740
Now, there's a program that I've been asked to participate in, but it just hasn't worked for my schedule.

22:56.061 --> 23:03.693
And it's, I believe it's called the Former Leaders Conference.

23:03.713 --> 23:07.679
And I think it just hasn't taken off the way they want.

23:07.940 --> 23:13.348
I spoke to them a year ago, or maybe it was almost two years ago, and there was a sampling.

23:13.749 --> 23:16.373
But what I worried about afterward was

23:16.893 --> 23:23.320
Did they get those people together with their current likeness?

23:23.500 --> 23:26.312
Well, I don't think so.

23:27.490 --> 23:33.021
I hesitate to say that they didn't because I didn't participate in the program.

23:33.121 --> 23:36.368
I believe that there was going to be some student leaders there.

23:37.670 --> 23:47.490
Whether they specifically tried to link people would be interesting.

23:47.470 --> 23:53.719
One of the nice things that I had available to me was the other MSC presidents.

23:54.140 --> 24:03.714
And in fact, as part of my executive team and I took a retreat, we went to Navasota.

24:04.154 --> 24:04.895
No, take that back.

24:04.935 --> 24:06.778
We went to Houston.

24:06.758 --> 24:12.627
had dinner with former MSC execs.

24:14.129 --> 24:23.403
We really spent a great deal of time with Greg Hawkins, having him talk to us about, and the other execs talked to us about their experiences.

24:24.304 --> 24:34.740
And then we came back, we went to a production, I'll never forget, we went to see Ain't Misbehavin', Jones Hall, and came back to Navasota.

24:34.720 --> 24:57.623
and we spent the night in navasota at um at the davis ranch roy roy davis and dennis's dennis parents they allowed us to stay up at their ranch uh and and you know worked out i mean good retreat it was a really good retreat but always felt like i could call on on dennis or pat wood and pat wood and our our good friends now

24:57.603 --> 25:03.277
Dennis Davis or Pat Wood to be able to pick up the phone and call them and get advice from them.

25:03.598 --> 25:09.172
Pat put together a little notebook that we called it the MSC President's Bible.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.861
And that notebook talked about

25:14.393 --> 25:26.090
He did a great job of documenting some of his experience, but also saying these are the things that the MSC president needs to know.

25:26.130 --> 25:31.238
And included in there is how do you manage your relationship with the professional staff?

25:31.218 --> 25:35.184
How do you manage your relationship specifically with Jim Reynolds?

25:35.665 --> 25:39.591
How do you manage your relationship with the other student leaders on campus?

25:40.392 --> 25:42.215
How do you manage your relationship with student government?

25:42.235 --> 25:43.256
I mean, all those kinds of things.

25:43.296 --> 25:46.922
It's just really neat thoughts and his ideas.

25:47.503 --> 25:50.307
And so Dennis updated it and passed it on to me.

25:50.367 --> 25:52.290
I updated it and passed it on to Linda Hartman.

25:53.391 --> 26:00.482
In your year as MSC Council President, if we had polled the student body,

26:02.538 --> 26:10.290
Which do you think they would have said is the most important student leadership position on the campus of that big four?

26:11.192 --> 26:13.756
I think they would have said MSC president.

26:15.919 --> 26:18.503
And it may have been personality driven.

26:19.244 --> 26:28.579
Although the student body president would have been either MSC president or student body president,

26:28.677 --> 26:31.281
Yeah, student body president is more visible.

26:31.301 --> 26:31.862
More visible.

26:34.727 --> 26:46.025
But I believe that I was probably more visible, I think I was much more visible than my predecessors were.

26:46.325 --> 26:55.039
And so, you know, student body president and I were always generally together at events.

26:56.386 --> 27:00.754
So I guess it would really depend.

27:01.255 --> 27:09.630
He was also, I think sometimes that really depends on how much of a political animal the student body president is.

27:09.690 --> 27:13.697
Some student body presidents are just not political animals, but Mike was.

27:15.521 --> 27:20.149
Did you have any strong differences of opinion with any of those

27:20.551 --> 27:21.492
other three?

27:21.633 --> 27:29.424
No, it's almost like we became a club, this president's club.

27:29.644 --> 27:38.757
We would often get together for lunch and talk about problems we were having with our student volunteers who were student volunteers.

27:39.538 --> 27:47.149
We team up to fight things or to share our opinions with the administration like we were opposed to

27:47.129 --> 28:00.907
to the president's desire to take the rudder tower, the top floor rudder tower and create the faculty club because we didn't have an appreciation for a faculty club concept and that could have been the biggest part of it.

28:00.927 --> 28:09.458
But we saw him taking a facility away from the students or closing it to the students and giving it just to faculty and we were opposed to that.

28:09.438 --> 28:13.830
There was something that happened that year.

28:15.635 --> 28:22.333
There were incidents of, violence is such a

28:23.900 --> 28:28.325
maybe too inflammatory, but there were incidents of people doing things.

28:28.886 --> 28:36.834
The student body president, I can't remember what his situation was, but someone had mailed, he was getting nasty notes in the mail.

28:39.117 --> 28:46.465
Our off-campus Aggie president was getting nasty notes in the mail over in the student center.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.287
I got nasty notes in the mail.

28:48.267 --> 28:56.577
Somebody came into my office and put cologne or something in my chair.

28:59.221 --> 29:01.764
So we had... What were these notes about?

29:02.945 --> 29:04.327
What was the topic?

29:04.347 --> 29:05.288
I was trying to remember.

29:05.308 --> 29:13.178
I don't remember.

29:14.744 --> 29:20.616
I think it was critical of their positions on things.

29:21.198 --> 29:29.395
But you're giving me the impression they must not have been on the same topic day after day after day or you would have remembered it.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.164
No, no.

29:32.465 --> 29:42.516
It seemed like there was one or two incidents that happened to each one of us, and they all came about the same time, and we shared those.

29:42.536 --> 29:49.063
Now, the only person that was left out of this, no, the Corps commander, had to put up with it.

29:49.624 --> 29:56.732
There were folks who were saying not-so-nice things about the Corps.

29:56.712 --> 30:06.587
the previous year had a very rough, this would have been in 85, 86, had a pretty rough year in the media.

30:07.008 --> 30:16.282
And Garland Wilkinson was determined to not have things that had historically happened, happen again.

30:17.625 --> 30:20.509
And so it was not,

30:20.489 --> 30:34.249
I thought he was, I still think he's one of the greatest Corps commanders because I came to see him as, I really came to see him as a commander in chief.

30:36.171 --> 30:39.336
I think the members of the Corps respected him a great deal.

30:40.257 --> 30:47.728
I also went to him and said, you know, you've got a seat on the council, Garland, I need you to be

30:47.708 --> 30:48.810
a member of the council.

30:48.970 --> 30:51.434
I need you to be a very visible member on campus.

30:52.055 --> 30:55.200
I quite often went to have dinner with the Corps at his invitation.

30:56.923 --> 31:03.734
He was very big about promoting the Corps and the Corps members' involvement in other student organizations, and so that was nice.

31:04.274 --> 31:04.815
That was nice.

31:05.596 --> 31:10.965
But that group of us, we were probably as close as

31:10.945 --> 31:17.320
I guess kind of common experiences and not just the roles brought us all together.

31:18.462 --> 31:24.677
We were, I remember the RHA, off campus Aggies wanted to do a big Mardi Gras deal.

31:25.900 --> 31:29.528
Now it lost a lot of money, but we thought it was wonderful to have Mardi Gras.
