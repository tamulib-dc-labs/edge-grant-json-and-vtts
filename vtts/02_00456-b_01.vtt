WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:11.098
We were talking about the bombings and how you felt 
about the bombings and you said that you felt that

00:01.837 --> 00:11.098
they should have been started sooner. Would you 
care to continue on with that? Well, I don't know

00:16.610 --> 00:19.397
when they started, you know, the bombings. You 
said they should have started sooner. Well, I

00:21.867 --> 00:23.730
thought you said that. Did I think they should have 
started sooner? Yeah, I asked if you thought they

00:27.575 --> 00:29.557
should have started sooner. I don't know when they 
started, but they should have been going all the

00:29.698 --> 00:36.146
time, I think. Well, they weren't. They didn't 
start until the Vietnam War. So after the advisors

00:44.227 --> 00:51.916
had been there, I mean, you know, first of all, it 
was just all these many, many advisors that were

00:44.227 --> 00:51.916
there, and then finally started sending troops 
over. And it wasn't until later on that LBJ told

00:53.077 --> 01:13.622
people that he lied to the American people and said 
that they were not bombing him, and he'd already

00:53.077 --> 01:13.622
ordered them, and he manipulated people into 
getting them

00:53.077 --> 01:13.622
to believe that they were doing the bombing. Let me 
see. Okay. So you believe that the bombing was

01:17.981 --> 01:20.624
extremely effective? Yeah, it felt effective 
anyway. Well, do you think it would have been more

01:23.428 --> 01:30.659
effective if they had not told the Vietnam about 
it? Sure. Is this one of the things that you were

01:31.139 --> 01:35.886
referring to back at the beginning when you said we 
could have won the war? Oh, yeah. I don't see, well,

01:37.608 --> 01:42.415
I don't think we warned anybody the cities in 
Germany, when we bombed the cities in Germany. I

01:47.170 --> 01:53.178
know we didn't warn the ones in Japan, and I know how 
effective those were. We certainly didn't let

01:53.779 --> 01:56.282
them know that we were going to bomb Hiroshima. 
Right, that's what I was saying. Or Berlin. Hitler

01:58.665 --> 02:00.528
did not know we were going to bomb Berlin. No. Any of 
the other places. And because we didn't do that,

02:03.572 --> 02:06.195
they were effective. I think we could have done the 
same thing. They always knew whenever we were

02:08.999 --> 02:12.283
going to do anything in Vietnam. They usually knew 
before we did. Phil

02:14.970 --> 02:29.470
Caputo said that that was one of the things that 
really frustrated him, was that he felt the Viet

02:14.970 --> 02:29.470
Cong knew what was going on more than before the 
American minds had even made up their minds.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.976
That's one of the things that bothered me, like the 
people coming to work in the truck. Those people

02:34.016 --> 02:38.102
knew hours, you know, 20 hours, 10 hours. But they 
didn't tell us. They wouldn't tell us. Was Wes

02:42.046 --> 02:44.069
Moreland at the base where you were? No. I don't 
know where. I guess he was at MACV. I don't know

02:47.593 --> 02:48.895
where he was at. He might have been in, I don't know. 
Do you have any Jimmy Famous generals that were

02:53.781 --> 02:56.845
there? Oh, yeah. Mo Meyer was there. He was a 
four-star general. I liked Mo Meyer a lot. Had a lot

03:04.033 --> 03:05.315
of respect for him. I saw him a lot, yeah. But there 
was a lot of generals around. You know, you didn't

03:13.030 --> 03:14.692
see them very much. One time, I remember they had 
40, like 40 generals and admirals at Tonsenute at

03:14.892 --> 03:25.983
one time for a meeting. And, you know, we were the 
7th Pacific Air Force, and that was 7th Pacific Air

03:26.724 --> 03:33.551
Force headquarters at that compound. We didn't 
guard them anywhere. Part of us did, but they were

03:36.115 --> 03:39.780
assigned to that unit. And all of these people were 
at this, and they were all either generals or

03:39.800 --> 03:50.456
admirals or above that, whatever it is. And we just 
knew that we were going to get hit during that time.

03:55.884 --> 03:57.527
I don't know why we didn't, but we didn't. But that 
was a lot of brass in one spot at one time. Did you

04:03.183 --> 04:08.089
know there were more generals in Vietnam than 
there were in the entire Second World War? No, I

04:08.209 --> 04:09.110
didn't know that. Yes, there were only about five, 
six generals in the First Second World War. I mean,

04:13.876 --> 04:18.802
there were very minimal ones, in excess of 30 in 
Vietnam. A lot of the reason behind this was the

04:19.303 --> 04:23.688
careerism. They needed a nice war on the record, so 
they went over there and they spent some time

04:23.708 --> 04:28.414
there. So they could get it on even if they were only 
there six months. There were three months that

04:31.589 --> 04:33.811
they'd been to Vietnam. And then they came back so 
they could progress up the ladder. Makes sense.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.399
This is a proven fact. Yeah. Not just hearsay. 
Yeah. That it happened. I don't know how much this

04:48.446 --> 04:55.212
was true in the Air Force because the Air Force was 
still, you know, The Air Force has always been a

04:57.402 --> 05:01.450
get-in-and-get-out outfit. Their officers 
didn't linger around. Most of the ones that I've

05:04.617 --> 05:13.234
talked to, and I've talked to a great many that went 
to Hanoi Hilton,

05:15.239 --> 05:16.080
They didn't stay there. They were in the 
Philippines. Yeah. And they flew and landed there

05:18.624 --> 05:23.491
where you were, and then they took off and flew 
their missions and then flew back. Right. And they

05:23.811 --> 05:28.138
just were hit and run type things, except for the 
helicopters. Yeah, there was, you know, we had a

05:29.820 --> 05:35.188
lot of, we had some reconnaissance aircraft 
there. Did they have the F-84 there? F-84s? No. I

05:40.675 --> 05:42.536
moved up to the Phantom F-4 jets. Yeah, they had the 
F-4s, and then they had the A-1E Sky Raiders, or

05:42.556 --> 05:48.822
A-1s, whatever. That's a Sky Raider. Prop plane. 
And that was Vietnamese aircraft. They had an

05:54.447 --> 06:01.134
American commander that flew the lead aircraft.

06:02.235 --> 06:04.737
But there was a lot of pilots there. in and out of 
there because of the aircraft that was there. And a

06:10.783 --> 06:13.827
lot of C-130s and whatnot that flew in and out of 
there. I was telling you about the bounty. We had a

06:19.233 --> 06:29.886
girl, a South Vietnamese girl that was killing 
pilots, killing anybody that was an American. And

06:31.047 --> 06:34.251
she rode a motorbike, and she would Ride by, and she 
used a .45 automatic, and she would kill anybody

06:34.906 --> 06:42.235
walking by. She'd just shoot them and just never 
stop. We had a very, very good shot. In the village

06:47.782 --> 06:49.444
or at the Air Force? In Saigon. In Saigon. Yeah, and 
on the outskirts.

06:55.652 --> 06:59.296
And we had orders to kill her on site. Did you kill 
her? Did anybody kill her? We, you know, we... We

07:02.513 --> 07:03.174
looked for it. We wanted to kill her very bad. I was 
wanting to real bad. And like I say, we were on duty

07:08.323 --> 07:12.590
just at night. And of course, she operated a lot 
during that time. And one night, we heard a

07:17.578 --> 07:20.823
motorbike coming. And she had a driver, a man 
driver, drove the motorbike. And she rode on the

07:25.110 --> 07:26.192
back. And we heard this motorbike. It was quiet, 
except for shots going off and stuff. It was dark

07:32.602 --> 07:33.824
and it was quiet. And this motorbike was coming in 
and weaved. What she'd do is she'd ride by MP posts

07:37.508 --> 07:45.118
or security police posts and shoot them, just 
harass them. She'd be gone before you could

07:45.138 --> 07:46.841
recover. And so we heard this bike coming. And sure 
enough, it was a guy driving and a girl on the back.

07:55.315 --> 08:06.205
And so we loaded, you know, we put our M16s on full 
automatic, and we were going to just empty those

07:55.315 --> 08:06.205
clips, you know, same as she got. But we had to wait 
for her to fire because we didn't know what she

08:06.586 --> 08:09.528
looked like. And they all looked the same anyway, 
so. Anyway, she got closer and closer, and she'd

08:14.513 --> 08:18.817
weave from one side of the street to the other. And 
she'd come plumb over to where we were. We were in a

08:22.701 --> 08:24.242
sandbag bunker. And she got all the way over. And we 
had, we were, I mean, we had her sights locked in on

08:26.913 --> 08:31.844
her. And she never fired. And she got down the road 
about 100 yards and an MP shot her with a shotgun and

08:35.112 --> 08:41.827
killed her. He hadn't seen her before. So you 
didn't get to kill her. So somebody got to kill her.

08:46.782 --> 08:47.323
Somebody got to kill her. She got dead. She got 
dead, but she killed a lot of pilots. Where'd she

08:52.189 --> 08:53.972
collect the bounty from, the VC? I don't know where 
they got it. Jane found it. I don't know where she

09:01.101 --> 09:06.628
got it. Do you have any opinion on why there's still 
MIAs in Vietnam? I don't know why. Evidently

09:16.816 --> 09:24.066
there's some somewhere, either bodies or alive.

09:24.166 --> 09:28.252
I can't imagine them being alive, but there could 
be. I think if there is, then we should go get them

09:28.352 --> 09:32.558
out. But I've thought that all along. I've thought 
that. You know, we should have went and got them a

09:37.291 --> 09:44.098
long time ago, if there was even a thought that they 
were in there. I think we should have. I don't think

09:48.583 --> 09:54.309
they really knew that they were there until the 
prisoners of war started returning. Yeah. Oh, I

09:54.990 --> 09:55.691
don't either. But, you know, we knew they had 
prisoners before. We didn't know how many or

09:59.655 --> 10:03.259
anything, probably, but we knew they were there. 
And there was an attempt, you know, but

10:10.433 --> 10:12.956
Yeah, I think if there's any suspicion, I would go.

10:17.522 --> 10:29.618
You told me the other day that they told you that you 
were supposed to avoid, act so that you could avoid

10:17.522 --> 10:29.618
any international incidents. Could you 
elaborate a little bit on that? Well, being told

10:33.864 --> 10:38.550
that, you didn't know what that meant. other than 
you weren't supposed to get involved in anything

10:40.032 --> 10:50.082
that would cause repercussions from the South 
Vietnamese. And we had a couple of things that

10:51.503 --> 10:54.386
happened. One particular one, we had a security 
policeman that was involved with a prostitute on

10:54.746 --> 11:03.415
the installation. And like I said, that 
installation belonged to the Vietnamese. we paid

11:07.184 --> 11:34.120
rent for the landing strips and we built them but we 
had to pay to use them yeah so but anyway this

11:07.184 --> 11:34.120
security policeman got in trouble with the 
prostitute there and what had happened they left

11:07.184 --> 11:34.120
he went to her house and she wanted money when they 
got there and He wouldn't give it to her, so she

11:35.635 --> 11:39.621
started screaming. The Vietnamese Quang Cong 
military police were passing and heard it. So they

11:44.948 --> 11:55.764
stopped and captured this security policeman and 
take him and lock him up in a connex, which is a metal

11:44.948 --> 11:55.764
box about 10 foot cubed. You've probably seen 
them. Go ahead and describe it. Okay, well, it's

12:00.170 --> 12:02.453
probably 10 foot. uh cube you know the sides are all 
10 foot probably pretty close to the size of it and

12:02.838 --> 12:30.297
it's solid metal anyway they locked him up in there 
we didn't know where he was somebody one of the guys

12:02.838 --> 12:30.297
had seen it so turned it in to our commander which 
was he was a lieutenant colonel and the base

12:02.838 --> 12:30.297
commander that was a vietnamese was a major I don't 
remember his name now, but he was a major. And so I

12:35.256 --> 12:40.444
found out he was in this Connex. So our colonel took 
some guys in some machine gun jeeps. We had lots of

12:45.491 --> 12:47.314
machine gun jeeps. And he took several with him and 
went down to QC headquarters and told the QC to

12:47.374 --> 12:58.751
release this security policeman. They told him 
no, that he was... He was arrested and locked up for

13:00.905 --> 13:04.388
rape. And so this lieutenant colonel told him. He 
said, I want him out. And I want him out right now. So

13:13.077 --> 13:16.500
the Vietnamese base commander, the major, showed 
up. And the major pulled a pistol on our commander.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.007
What rank was he? Our commander. He was a 
lieutenant colonel. OK. And so he told him, he

13:27.365 --> 13:32.533
said, you've got one hour to release this security 
policeman. And he said, if you don't, I'll turn

13:33.895 --> 13:39.023
every machine gun jeep I got loose on your 
headquarters. And in an hour, he was out. They

13:43.169 --> 13:43.850
released him. But the next day, the guy wasn't 
there anymore. So that's what you were talking

13:49.876 --> 13:52.662
about, the shifting back to the United States? 
That's what we were told. He has gone home. Because

13:55.929 --> 13:58.034
they'd have probably killed him if he had stayed. 
You ever heard those called the sweat blocks? The

14:00.198 --> 14:00.860
hot blocks? No. But I knew a lot of guys that got 
locked up in them. A lot of QCs that got locked up in

14:04.388 --> 14:07.955
them. But

14:11.594 --> 14:20.726
anyway, the national incidents, you know, you 
didn't do anything to offend or you wasn't

14:11.594 --> 14:20.726
supposed to. Do you feel that your friends died for 
nothing? No. I feel like, no, I don't. Again, you

14:31.360 --> 14:39.731
know, we all go back, it all goes back to the fact 
that no one knew how the Vietnam War was going to

14:31.360 --> 14:39.731
end. Um, You know, to say it makes me angry to hear 
someone say that guys died for nothing in Vietnam

14:43.859 --> 14:57.195
or fought for nothing, because that's a lie. The 
kind of people I expect to hear that from is a person

14:57.496 --> 15:05.946
that deserted to Canada instead of having to go to 
the service. That's like a cop out. Those guys died

15:10.111 --> 15:13.275
fighting, and they You know, they were fighting as 
hard as they possibly could. They didn't want to

15:17.294 --> 15:18.575
die. But they were fighting for a cause. And a lot of 
those guys died,

15:20.938 --> 15:28.406
you know, from heroics doing things that they 
didn't have to do. And no, I don't think they died

15:28.446 --> 15:33.291
for nothing. I don't think they died for a cause. 
Whatever that turns out to be, the war, whatever,

15:43.090 --> 15:45.195
Somebody else has got to be responsible for that. 
And, you know, for it being for the wrong reason, if

15:46.438 --> 15:54.937
it did something wrong, then I think somebody else 
is responsible for that. I think that guy that

15:55.779 --> 15:58.746
fought out there was completely innocent. I think 
he was fighting for the right reason.

16:04.522 --> 16:12.429
Have you ever heard it said that the Vietnam War was 
a civil war going on between the internal and the

16:04.522 --> 16:12.429
country? Yes.

16:17.214 --> 16:29.685
I just mentioned that this was a civil war between 
the two countries, between North and South, much

16:17.214 --> 16:29.685
like the North and South in the United States, in 
which no foreign country intervened. And yet we

16:30.506 --> 16:33.128
went over there and intervened there. do you think 
we should have gone in there in the first place,

16:33.547 --> 16:43.438
irregardless of how you feel about defending your 
country or going to war for the United States? Then

16:43.458 --> 16:49.704
you're not asking me as a soldier or as a citizen, 
but as a politician. So you look at it as a political

16:50.545 --> 16:53.509
standpoint. Oh, really? Yeah, I do, yeah. Okay. So 
my asking you that question then puts it not as a

16:56.332 --> 17:01.377
soldier's, Me asking you as a soldier, but as 
though you were a politician. Or as a soldier or a

17:06.341 --> 17:11.789
citizen, instead of being the politician. I think 
I could answer that. Do you think we should have

17:15.735 --> 17:19.520
been there in the first place?

17:20.902 --> 17:28.073
My understanding, the way I was told and the way I 
understood it, we were there to stop communist

17:20.902 --> 17:28.073
aggression.

17:30.567 --> 17:34.571
which was the North, and the South wanted 
democracy. Am I not right? That was the theory,

17:39.056 --> 17:40.057
yes. Okay, all right. If that was the case, then I 
think it wasn't wrong to be there if the South

17:43.681 --> 17:51.950
wanted us to be there. But they really didn't. You 
already stated that because you said they didn't

17:53.952 --> 17:58.397
want you in their villages. Well, now I said that. 
Because of that bomb, because of that Phantom 4

18:00.267 --> 18:02.349
bomb. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know that that was 
a feeling of the South, you know. I don't know that

18:08.396 --> 18:13.842
that was, evidently it wasn't a feeling of the 
government in South Vietnam. Well, that was the

18:13.862 --> 18:15.544
Saigon government, though. Well, it represented 
the South, or the people. So, you know, evidently

18:20.249 --> 18:28.418
they wanted us there, or we wouldn't have been 
there, I don't believe. But I think we went there. I

18:34.793 --> 18:38.558
don't think it was a lot different, I don't 
believe, than Korea.

18:42.103 --> 18:43.645
You had North and South Korea. We were doing 
practically the same thing. Is that right? No, it

18:50.594 --> 18:51.756
was a little bit different. Yeah, somewhat. 
Because the majority of the people that were in

18:53.608 --> 19:02.857
South Vietnam had come from the North and went down 
to the South, and that was not true in Korea. Yeah.

19:05.239 --> 19:08.062
Korea did have some differences in Korea. But most 
of those people that went from the North to the

19:08.282 --> 19:15.169
South went there because they wanted democracy, 
because they wanted freedom. They didn't have

19:16.210 --> 19:17.431
that in the North. Ho Chi Minh did not let them have 
that in the election. Do you know why? No. Because

19:22.263 --> 19:23.284
he knew he'd lose. Is that right? So he wouldn't let 
him have it. He was killed. He was killed

19:27.910 --> 19:29.632
eventually. So that was, you know, as

19:30.693 --> 19:51.679
an individual, as a voting citizen or a soldier or 
whatever, again, I don't think it was for me to

19:30.693 --> 19:51.679
question or make the judgment whether or not we 
should be there. But the fact that we were ordered

19:52.604 --> 19:57.573
to go, I think you have to make a decision. Either 
you're going to live in this country and do what

19:58.053 --> 20:08.792
you're supposed to do and what you're asked to do, 
like they have been ever since this country

19:58.053 --> 20:08.792
started, or move.

20:13.099 --> 20:18.088
So then you very definitely feel, as you stated 
earlier, that we should not have pulled out.

20:21.494 --> 20:24.178
No, I didn't say that we shouldn't have pulled out. 
You said you should have stayed there until we won

20:25.580 --> 20:28.625
the war, that we could have won the war. I said that 
we could have won it. We could have, I think, at any

20:30.808 --> 20:33.011
time. Well, it seems to me that maybe I'm wrong, I'm 
misunderstanding. If

20:40.963 --> 20:49.476
the politicians had stayed out of it and let the... 
military fighting and stayed there and won the

20:51.447 --> 20:56.876
war, then there wouldn't have been any need to pull 
out. No, I don't believe there would have been. I

20:59.581 --> 21:09.237
believe if we would have fought that war like we 
fought World War II, the majority of the battles in

20:59.581 --> 21:09.237
World War II, it would have been over. In World War 
II, the difference was that we were fighting for

21:09.993 --> 21:13.777
territory. That's right. But we were not fighting 
for territory in Vietnam. But we should have been.

21:20.826 --> 21:26.873
You mean to go up into the North and move up and just 
flush it all out? I think you had to do that. So

21:30.537 --> 21:34.061
that's where to bring back in your bombings that 
you were talking about. They just came in and

21:34.141 --> 21:38.987
surprised the bombings and bombed the daylights 
out of these people. Civilians, you know, one

21:39.237 --> 21:51.630
thing that I can elaborate on very definitely is 
that we never want to see a war in this country. If a

21:53.011 --> 22:08.687
person has ever seen, witnessed a war-torn 
country, and when you do, you think about home and

21:53.011 --> 22:08.687
what it does to the country, we never want to see 
that happen here. The thing about it, and one of the

22:09.578 --> 22:19.627
reasons is because when there's a war, like 
Germany or wherever, when there's a war,

22:09.578 --> 22:19.627
civilians pay the price. Children pay the price. 
Women pay the price. It doesn't just get the men. I

22:28.495 --> 22:39.585
believe, I think history proves that you can't 
just single out the men. and win the war. I think you

22:40.980 --> 22:49.041
can't, like we did, I don't think you can warn 
villages and have all the people get out. And, you

22:50.285 --> 22:52.731
know, villages weren't nothing. half of them 
lived underground anyway back years ago in the

22:53.032 --> 23:22.870
wars they didn't in the first world war for 
instance they didn't bomb for a long time they

22:53.032 --> 23:22.870
didn't bomb anything might kill civilians and it 
was later on and then the atrocities that Hitler

22:53.032 --> 23:22.870
and the Nazis did the whole policy was changed and 
they started bombing and it's carried over into it

22:53.032 --> 23:22.870
and a lot of the Americans people felt that it was 
carried too far in Vietnam when I don't really

23:23.288 --> 23:35.839
think I personally lived through this and was 
older than you are and was aware of more of what was

23:23.288 --> 23:35.839
going on but yet I didn't know anything that was 
going on. It's kind of a mixed metaphor to say that I

23:36.959 --> 23:43.045
knew what was going on because I was being lied to. I 
really didn't know what was going on. I think the

23:47.508 --> 23:51.412
media hurt the war. I blame the media for a lot of the 
problems with Vietnam. Lieutenant Kelly, for

23:59.531 --> 24:04.820
instance, you know, in the My Lai incident. Yeah, 
because in the My Lai incident, I don't think he

24:06.703 --> 24:13.275
was... I felt at the time that he was innocent of 
doing it deliberately. Yeah, well. And from what

24:19.369 --> 24:22.313
I've learned since then, I don't see how he could 
have avoided it. How anybody over there could have

24:22.593 --> 24:25.437
avoided killing civilians. Well, I don't think he 
can. I know that I think he killed a lot of people

24:29.181 --> 24:34.247
needlessly, probably. But in the first place, in 
that thing, It shouldn't have ever been exposed to

24:40.542 --> 24:45.207
the American people. It should have been kept 
within the military and dealt with there. If he was

24:49.232 --> 25:00.244
guilty of what they said he was guilty of, then he 
should have been held, you know, a military

24:49.232 --> 25:00.244
court-martial should have been held, which it 
was, but it was wide open to the public. And it

25:00.625 --> 25:01.586
shouldn't have been. And it shouldn't have been. 
It should have been confined to military people

25:02.407 --> 25:08.033
only, and it shouldn't have been publicized at 
all. But the people... demanded it, you know, so

25:10.597 --> 25:16.006
they gave it to them, you know, and they gave them 
Kelly, too. Are you familiar with, it's Kelly.

25:18.209 --> 25:18.630
Kelly. Are you familiar with the Pentagon Papers? 
No. Well, the Pentagon Papers were the, McNamara

25:21.455 --> 25:35.237
went over there and wrote all these documents, 
30-some-odd documents on what was going on in the

25:21.455 --> 25:35.237
Vietnam War, and it was supposed to be top secret in 
a man named Ellsberg. He took it out, it was top

25:35.892 --> 25:42.423
secret, he took it out and gave it to the New York 
Times and it went to the Supreme Court. The Supreme

25:42.984 --> 25:49.535
Court ruled that the newspapers had a right to it 
and they started publishing it. And that's when

25:51.478 --> 25:57.429
the American people started finding out what was 
really going on in Vietnam, which they should have

25:51.478 --> 25:57.429
known all along. Because that's what happened 
during the Second World War, they knew about what

25:57.949 --> 26:01.275
was going on. What they didn't know about was that 
in the Second World War, it was just similar to

26:01.812 --> 26:18.954
this, to the Vietnam War in a very minute sense, is 
that Roosevelt was trying, just like LBJ,

26:01.812 --> 26:18.954
to get the war started. Roosevelt tried 
everything he could, saying he was keeping us out

26:18.974 --> 26:28.967
of the war, to get us into the war, and finally we got 
into the war with the Japanese, which he was well

26:18.974 --> 26:28.967
aware of. According to historical. Would you 
have, after you came back, you spent one year

26:32.272 --> 26:41.000
there, would you have gone back for another second 
tour after you came back? Would I have gone back?

26:42.702 --> 26:44.423
Under what kind of circumstances? Would you have 
just taken another tour back to Vietnam? I didn't.

26:48.007 --> 26:51.310
No, but would you have if you'd had a chance? I had a 
chance. Anybody did. I mean, you can extend. Why

26:56.034 --> 26:56.895
didn't you go back? I liked home too much. But even 
after you came back, a lot of men did go back for a

26:59.913 --> 27:05.662
second and third tour. Some did, yeah. I don't know 
the figures on it, but I do know that some did. Oh,

27:10.469 --> 27:11.691
yeah, they did. Some guys did it for money. Some 
guys did it for, some guys are weird and just did it.

27:21.225 --> 27:26.013
Well, that, and some guys probably did it for 
patriotic reasons. I don't know. What was it like

27:27.475 --> 27:28.857
when you came home? And like coming home from going 
on vacation. Like flying in anywhere, getting off

27:37.020 --> 27:44.892
the plane, going away. You know, when we came back,

27:44.932 --> 27:53.886
you know, we landed in San Francisco. And I mean, 
you know, it probably the greatest moment,

27:56.967 --> 28:03.997
greatest feeling I've ever had in my life was 
getting home, you know, coming home. And, uh, when

28:05.119 --> 28:13.351
we landed in, you know, there was no parties 
waiting for us or no people, you know, yeah,

28:05.119 --> 28:13.351
nothing like that. I mean, it wasn't anybody. I 
mean, we were, it was early in the morning and, uh,

28:14.773 --> 28:21.183
cold, which we wasn't used to. And, uh, So we, you 
know, we got on our different flights and flew

28:23.242 --> 28:27.948
home. And when you got to your hometown, there 
wasn't, you know, you're just there. Not any big

28:34.958 --> 28:37.441
hoopla like there had been before? No, nothing. 
How were you treated as a Vietnam veteran? I wasn't

28:41.106 --> 28:42.188
treated bad. I wasn't treated anyway, I don't 
suppose. You just felt like you were ignored.

28:49.057 --> 28:52.101
Well, nobody said anything at all, you know, I 
mean. I know of guys that went through some pretty

28:52.638 --> 28:56.783
bad things that came home, you know. But we didn't 
have as much problem, I don't think, in Texas as

28:57.244 --> 29:03.952
they did up north. Why? There was more.

29:07.677 --> 29:11.902
I don't know why, unless it's because it's more of a 
rural type state. Now, maybe in big cities they may

29:11.942 --> 29:14.425
have had more. I don't know. But, you know, I live in 
a small town. Yes, sir. we didn't have any

29:20.262 --> 29:41.444
demonstrations or anything like that going on, 
you know, or, or, uh, anybody meeting us at the

29:20.262 --> 29:41.444
plane or anything and giving us a hard time, you 
know, that happened in a lot of places, but it

29:20.262 --> 29:41.444
didn't, uh, I had trouble adjusting when I came 
back out. Uh, when I came, we worked at night all the

29:41.464 --> 29:45.108
time. We were, we were not out much in the daytime 
and, uh, So we were white as a, you know, as a sheet.

29:57.388 --> 30:04.435
And so we'd lay out in the sun before we came home to 
try to get our skin back to a natural color, you

29:57.388 --> 30:04.435
know. And we got to where, you know, you even got to 
where you could see good at night. I got to where I

30:09.881 --> 30:17.069
could see unbelievably good, I guess, because you 
adjusted to the darkness. But anyway, when we came

30:17.149 --> 30:20.172
home, couldn't sleep. And so I'd stay up at night 
and sleep in the daytime. And I did that for a long

30:25.990 --> 30:30.736
time, you know, before, after we got back. Did you 
start into the law business right after that? No. I

30:34.822 --> 30:35.803
was doing the service. That seems to be like a night 
job. How did you manage that? Well, of course,

30:39.028 --> 30:40.970
Social Security policemen do work at night. Yeah. 
So you just worked a night shift. But I was, yeah. I

30:46.057 --> 30:48.040
was, no, I had a problem. You know, I had 30 days 
before I went back in. you know, back on duty. But,

30:54.239 --> 30:59.285
you know, it was hard to do, hard to adjust. It was 
kind of like being in another world, you know,

30:59.365 --> 31:04.491
after being a year. All of a sudden, you know, 
that's one of the funny things about that. If you

31:08.155 --> 31:16.585
came back on a ship, a lot of them did in World War II, 
you had two months or so to get ready to come back.
