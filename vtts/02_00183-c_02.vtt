WEBVTT

00:03.760 --> 00:04.881
And there weren't any problems. I think if you ask 
people for advice and take it as good, you'll be all

00:05.943 --> 00:12.431
right. But if you just ignore them and say, we're 
going to do it this way, nobody appreciates that.

00:21.643 --> 00:29.052
Well, that was the reason that we made the growth we 
did in horticulture, was because I asked people's

00:21.643 --> 00:29.052
advice. They gave me three choices. And I took 
their advice, if I could fit it in any way. without

00:34.034 --> 00:35.015
disturbing them. That was all there was to it. Let 
me be sure of that.

00:43.322 --> 00:51.310
In the teaching faculty, who were the really 
outstanding people in the program? Bloodworth, I

00:51.970 --> 00:58.316
mean,

00:51.970 --> 00:58.316
isn't that awful? Homer Blackhurst, once the 
board came back and was there for 40 years, He was

01:04.747 --> 01:09.013
very stable, and I depended on him a lot. I knew I 
couldn't depend on DeWorth, because DeWorth,

01:09.033 --> 01:13.659
everything I did, it was wrong with DeWorth. And 
such a letting all the girls in. You'll regret that

01:18.225 --> 01:20.688
the longest day you live. Describe Blackhurst's 
specialties. Peas, cow peas, I forgot what, I

01:24.533 --> 01:29.340
think it was cow peas. He did research on a certain 
kind of peas. and did it for years.

01:37.912 --> 01:44.919
But he taught freshman horticulture, which is 
beginning horticulture, many, many years. In

01:45.660 --> 01:49.365
fact, he saved Harvard during the war, or they 
wouldn't have had anybody. And when I wrote the

01:50.346 --> 01:57.754
citation up for our distinguished professor of 
the Harvard students, I put on there that he had

01:59.337 --> 02:02.560
saved the department during the war. And had it not 
been for Blackhurst hanging around and doing

02:03.381 --> 02:11.388
this, we wouldn't have had anybody to work with. 
But I was so glad to get him that distinguished

02:11.408 --> 02:18.094
award. I told the kids how to write it up, 
everything. And I got it. I was on the way to St.

02:24.259 --> 02:28.163
Louis to a meeting. No, I'm on the way to a big 
program in Kansas City. And I stopped just outside

02:36.009 --> 02:41.514
of Kansas City, and I called up Blackhurst person 
to person. I said, would you mind telling me what

02:42.035 --> 02:45.839
time it is? And he said, well, I got a hold of the 
secretary. She told me all about it, too. But he was

02:52.986 --> 02:55.568
very deserving of it. Any guy that stays out of the 
job 40 years, regardless of what he's doing,

02:56.138 --> 03:03.870
deserves to be recognized. And I felt so, even 
though I had people that didn't agree with me. They

03:09.999 --> 03:11.701
don't always have to agree with me. If I'm calling 
shots, I'm going to call them like I think they're

03:12.302 --> 03:14.806
right. And I thought that Blackhurst needed it. 
And you know the interesting thing about

03:18.031 --> 03:20.315
Blackhurst? He died in his sleep Christmas Eve. 
She died talking on the phone a week later. talking

03:25.687 --> 03:28.350
to one of the daughters. And before the diamond 
wanted to get there, she just toppled over. But he

03:34.656 --> 03:37.259
came from West Virginia.

03:40.242 --> 03:47.589
He was a character, but I enjoyed Homer and enjoyed 
working with him. You could work with Homer any

03:48.310 --> 03:50.813
time. You just never did. He never did really 
pursue you. The worst is it drove me crazy. And last

04:00.460 --> 04:03.164
year, I was there, and he was still there. Oh, my, I 
couldn't do anything wrong. Right, every day,

04:07.189 --> 04:12.417
he'd tell me what I'd done wrong and what was going 
to happen and all that. So I just said, well, that's

04:12.437 --> 04:15.000
your private privilege. As you look back on those 
years, of what are you most proud of? reorganizing

04:23.669 --> 04:26.053
horticulture, rebuilding horticulture. I did 
that.

04:31.722 --> 04:37.611
Well, that's the job I think I did the best job on 
academically, and I'm proudest of that. And I

04:38.252 --> 04:39.794
didn't have any trouble with that. It just took a 
little while to do it. And, no, that's the thing I

04:42.419 --> 04:48.428
am, in academics, that's the thing I think I, I 
pride myself more, or anything else, is

04:48.762 --> 04:55.370
rebuilding Harder Coater into a viable 
department. And it was a good one, too. But you take

04:58.013 --> 05:00.536
time.

05:04.281 --> 05:13.972
You see, I went up to McCandless and asked for a 
special fund to re-equip the office. And you had no

05:14.353 --> 05:16.075
one you were going to be. So I got some match 
furniture. And I went down and bought a little rug

05:18.496 --> 05:23.465
myself and put it in there, but it didn't work.

05:26.791 --> 05:33.363
When he just disappeared, he took all that 
furniture with him across the track to one of those

05:26.791 --> 05:33.363
shacks over there. Who's that? The department 
here that they hired, Mr. Garlick. I mean, he just

05:43.640 --> 05:46.684
disappeared one night. I came in, and all the 
furniture was gone. That had been bought on a

05:49.487 --> 05:54.153
special phone from McAnlis, the former 
department head. And I felt he was staying in that

05:54.173 --> 05:57.937
office, but he didn't stay there. You retired 
when? I retired in,

06:01.682 --> 06:06.848
let me see. You know, that had a pitfall in it. I 
retired in 76,

06:12.817 --> 06:19.366
I believe.

06:22.130 --> 06:31.122
As you look back, are there any people that you 
would want to thank that we haven't mentioned? I

06:33.224 --> 06:37.130
can never thank Ms. Runner enough for what she did 
for me. She let me take the president's home and use

06:39.273 --> 06:42.537
it as a lab, too. In the class. And this was the new 
president's home. Yes. And Jack Ridge was there

06:48.571 --> 06:52.997
for a while in that home. And now let's see. Well, 
I'll always be grateful to Blackhurst. And Dr.

07:01.249 --> 07:05.655
Nightingale was a very good friend of mine. And I 
admired him because, oh, he was treating

07:06.657 --> 07:12.625
something awful about Dorothy. He would have a 
research project set up. DeWorthy would come in

07:17.347 --> 07:19.209
and just throw it all out. And how he put up with it, I 
do not know, but he did. And then I hired Bill one

07:25.076 --> 07:36.329
time along to come and help me with the flowers on 
campus, because he was raising all this stuff up at

07:25.076 --> 07:36.329
Waco. And DeWorthy came in one day and said, you 
sure you made a mistake hiring that old boy? I said,

07:43.137 --> 07:43.978
well, prop? You taught him all he knows.

07:48.273 --> 07:53.239
You couldn't afford to take anything off that man, 
or he'd run you under his feet. So I just made a point

07:54.160 --> 07:57.144
that I didn't argue with him. I just said, well, 
that's your opinion. But when he said I was making a

07:59.947 --> 08:06.175
mistake letting all the girls in, and I said, well, 
I'm not letting them in. They're taxpayers'

08:06.215 --> 08:07.317
daughters. That just made him furious with me. But 
you have to do what you think's right at the time.

08:15.352 --> 08:15.773
Let's see. Other people that you want to thank? 
Well, Dick Potts and I, we never made horticulture

08:19.058 --> 08:29.094
without his help. Because there were so many 
loopholes to fill with the students. No one had

08:34.724 --> 08:37.047
ever given any counseling advising. They didn't 
know what they were supposed to take or when they

08:37.067 --> 08:40.493
were supposed to take it. And I could go down and 
work with Dick and he'd help me over the pumps.

08:48.633 --> 08:52.017
Oh, and Nelda in the president's office. Nelda 
Rowell then, now Nelda Green. Yes. Oh, she is a

08:55.381 --> 08:57.023
jewel. And she helped me over many rough spots. 
Give some examples. Oh, I'd go in and just tell her I

09:03.149 --> 09:04.911
had that. Well, I'll tell you one that really got 
me. This is the outstanding one, I think. You know,

09:11.810 --> 09:17.135
the court arms have walks, a big walk on. Well, I 
know when they reported, they were very thin, no

09:17.155 --> 09:20.278
reinforcing in them. And there were all kinds of 
big trucks coming in there, especially the

09:21.219 --> 09:28.306
vendors' trucks and the trash trucks. So the first 
thing I did, I closed the thing to nothing but

09:28.326 --> 09:32.951
emergency vehicles. A check sale came to see me, 
mad. He says, We're going to stop this. We have to

09:41.480 --> 09:42.281
get in there. I said, no, you don't. You're making 
money off of us, and we have a right to tell you what

09:43.682 --> 09:47.588
you can do and what you can't do. And he was a 
twice-meter man. Oh, he said, I'll go see Roderick

09:51.092 --> 09:55.017
about this. Before he got there, I put on the phone 
with Nelda. I said, Nelda, let me talk to Mr.

09:58.021 --> 10:00.605
Roderick real quick. I said, we have a man that 
insists on bringing those heavy trucks in there.

10:06.704 --> 10:08.266
And he's making money off of us. I think we have 
every right to tell him where he can park and how he

10:08.786 --> 10:11.730
can make the money. He says, I'll do it too. I'll 
wait for him. And so we did more. You know, you have

10:18.197 --> 10:22.923
to do what you think is right and stick by it. And 
they had no minutes coming in there, breaking up

10:23.423 --> 10:26.487
those walks. The kids had to walk on them. Anyway, 
we got that done. We also cleaned up the core area

10:31.105 --> 10:42.564
and hauled 59 truckloads of trash out of there and 
found 34 wall building plaques in the stuff. Oh,

10:42.605 --> 10:46.171
there's a lot of things to do. But I enjoyed my time. 
All right. I'm near the end of my questions.

10:58.156 --> 11:12.876
I want to be sure to mention to you, if you have any 
memorabilia and papers or anything relating to

10:58.156 --> 11:12.876
A&M that you ever want to dispose of, please put 
them in the A&M archives. They will preserve them

11:13.596 --> 11:15.960
and protect them. You know, all of that got lost in 
the move that I've made, but at least I think it has.

11:23.089 --> 11:24.010
I'm trying to think. When they moved us up here to 
assisted living. My daughter and my son put all

11:32.265 --> 11:40.114
that stuff, they put a lot of it up here, all they 
could get up here. But it's in an air-conditioned

11:40.674 --> 11:45.299
warehouse somewhere in Conroe. Well, if there are 
any papers, because this would be like the

11:45.439 --> 11:56.452
treasure house of the materials relating to A&M, 
and nobody else will care for them as well as the

11:45.439 --> 11:56.452
archives would. That's right. Well, I'll ask my 
daughter. I can't remember if I had a file on me. I'm

12:05.733 --> 12:06.656
sure I did. Well, if you did. But I don't know what to 
do. Whether it's students, faculty, student

12:08.963 --> 12:14.289
papers, faculty, it doesn't matter. All right, 
then the next to last one. Let's make believe that

12:16.412 --> 12:30.409
somebody walked up to you today and gave you a check 
for a million dollars, and there was only one

12:16.412 --> 12:30.409
condition to the gift, that you must pass it on to 
Texas A&M, but you decide what use would be made of

12:16.412 --> 12:30.409
it. What would you want to help A&M to do?

12:37.837 --> 12:41.721
Well, I'd want most of it to go back to 
scholarships. I guess they got lots of

12:41.801 --> 12:51.671
scholarships, but

12:41.801 --> 12:51.671
they haven't worked my way through A&M pretty 
hard. I'd want it to go to students. Would you want

12:55.695 --> 13:02.182
them

12:55.695 --> 13:02.182
identified as to major or anything? Would that 
matter? Just students? I've got a committee that

13:04.144 --> 13:05.646
does that. All right. All right, then my last 
question is, what are your feelings about A&M?

13:11.905 --> 13:12.185
Great. Couldn't be better. I love A&M. I always 
will love it. And as I said, what's the Aggie

13:16.670 --> 13:20.453
spirit? You can't tell what the Aggie spirit is. It 
just grows on you, and it's the part of it that you

13:23.737 --> 13:31.145
absorb during life that you don't get any other 
way. And I cherish all the years that I had there

13:37.102 --> 13:39.105
both as a student and faculty and everything. I 
have a few regrets that I couldn't get along with

13:40.647 --> 13:43.871
Paul Stevens. I couldn't get a lot of my stuff done, 
because every time I turned, he was blocking it or

13:43.911 --> 13:54.245
blowing cigar smoke in my face and those kind of 
things I didn't like. And I had the freedom to do

13:55.307 --> 14:02.316
things I wanted to do. I'm trying to think who the 
assistant dean of agriculture was at the time, and

14:03.190 --> 14:13.741
he was thinking West Campus as an ag campus. And we 
went down there to talk to Stevens about some

14:14.822 --> 14:22.070
possibilities of a building. And he said, I don't 
want to go back in there and talk to that man any

14:23.191 --> 14:27.836
minute. He don't quite understand me.

14:32.705 --> 14:41.164
I told him I was going to make this an ag campus, and 
he said, he just told me that he didn't do campus

14:32.705 --> 14:41.164
planning, and he didn't go in and do it. Just forget 
it. And I said, that's right. He's calling the

14:46.516 --> 14:47.458
shots.

14:50.144 --> 14:51.287
All right, let's quit with that.
