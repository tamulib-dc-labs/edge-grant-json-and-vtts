testing testing one two three one two three testing testing one two three this is tuesday may 2nd uh talking with john stewart senior majoring in actually junior right now almost senior majoring in geography minoring in business and your student leadership role is um i'm the interfraternity council president interfraternity council president yes sir

00:29.461 --> 00:39.334
To introduce yourself to anyone who might hear this tape or read the transcription, give a biographical summary of your progress so far.

00:39.354 --> 00:40.095
Where did you grow up?

00:40.255 --> 00:40.996
What did family do?

00:41.057 --> 00:41.838
High school?

00:42.599 --> 00:45.823
I grew up my entire life in Dallas.

00:45.843 --> 00:50.389
I went to a small private high school in North Dallas called Trinity Christian Academy.

00:50.673 --> 00:58.302
Decided in, I guess, about February of my senior year in high school that Texas A&M was the place for me to go.

00:58.482 --> 00:59.743
I'm a second generation Aggie.

01:00.364 --> 01:06.031
Dad graduated in 69 and served in the Corps of Cadets back then.

01:06.511 --> 01:10.676
And I came here, first semester here was fall of 99.

01:11.517 --> 01:16.342
And in the spring of 2000, that's when I decided to pledge a fraternity.

01:17.003 --> 01:18.705
And it's kind of an interesting thing.

01:19.242 --> 01:36.357
Having dad talk to me about the whole fraternity situation just because there is a nice healthy rivalry between the core and the fraternity system here on campus because it is similar in many ways and it has its differences.

01:36.337 --> 01:42.869
I think the main foundation between both of them are very similar.

01:43.329 --> 01:48.599
And so therefore there is, I think, a good healthy rivalry between the two systems.

01:48.899 --> 01:53.788
And so Dad and I obviously have that nice little rivalry going as well at home.

01:54.224 --> 01:58.128
When you were in high school, you came to visit a number of times.

01:58.168 --> 01:58.468
Yes, sir.

01:58.749 --> 02:01.471
I've been to A&M since I was in the womb.

02:02.212 --> 02:06.476
Mom and Dad had season tickets to football games when they were pregnant with me.

02:07.337 --> 02:09.900
And they had brought me down here quite a number of times.

02:10.040 --> 02:13.644
But I did make one official visit my senior year.

02:13.904 --> 02:15.005
It was during January.

02:15.986 --> 02:20.130
And I had brought my...

02:20.937 --> 02:47.282
best friend from high school with me and he was very he was wavering between coming coming to A&M going to Aveline Christian or going to Baylor and so I was I was really pushing if I did not I had I looked into playing football in college and I had looked at a lot of smaller schools around the state and around the the south of the United States and I said if I'm not going to play football I'm going to go to A&M so we made our visit down here and

02:47.549 --> 02:54.481
Luckily, I came down here with him because I was pointing out a lot of the stuff that my parents had taught me about A&M when he came down.

02:55.022 --> 03:00.172
And come to find out, we've lived together all three years that I've been here so far.

03:01.093 --> 03:04.319
And our friendship's gotten even closer.

03:04.439 --> 03:07.184
But absolutely fell in love with it.

03:07.264 --> 03:09.388
We had made the visit that weekend.

03:09.368 --> 03:21.819
of A&M on that Friday I believe and then that Saturday we made the visit to Baylor and there was just honestly no comparison so I wound up I think winning them over for A&M that weekend.

03:21.939 --> 03:34.491
What do you think were the key factors for you endorsing your choice and him helping him make the choice for A&M?

03:34.511 --> 03:38.194
What did A&M do right on those visits?

03:38.410 --> 03:49.209
Well, definitely, I think the one thing that stood out in his mind, and as well as in my mind, it just kind of reinforced a lot of things, was definitely the tour that we took.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.596
Just being able to see campus during an actual school.

03:53.616 --> 03:55.520
It was on a Friday, so it was still a school day.

03:56.421 --> 04:00.368
Being able to see the campus like we did

04:00.668 --> 04:12.747
just kind of in the eyes of, it was a senior in the corps that took us around, so it was kind of the eyes and a good old ag and just being able to intermingle with the students there.

04:12.887 --> 04:22.322
We had visited the rec center as well that afternoon and just, I mean honestly everybody says it but it is so true, just the friendly atmosphere that is on campus.

04:22.302 --> 04:30.199
It was just very prevalent when we came down, and it stood out, I know, in my good friends' mind, just as well as mine.

04:30.560 --> 04:39.799
And I think it really did reinforce my mom and my dad realizing that this should be the place for me and really, truly is the place for me.

04:39.940 --> 04:40.841
Did you go to fish camp?

04:41.242 --> 04:41.503
I did.

04:41.723 --> 04:42.505
Loved fish camp.

04:43.143 --> 05:12.154
I was I went to one I think it was the first session of fish camp summer 99 and Made some great friends over fish camp still hang out with a lot of people that I met in my color group and It was it was a lot of fun ever just I remember it being so so hot that summer but it was still we had so much fun and I mean I still cherish a lot of the stuff that we had done during fish camp and and am I correct in

05:12.927 --> 05:20.558
Understanding that you learn some traditions and yells and songs

05:20.960 --> 05:23.624
but also some advice about how to survive?

05:23.864 --> 05:25.066
Correct.

05:25.847 --> 05:30.173
I mean, a lot of the stuff that they give you, they give you a couple packets and stuff worth of information.

05:30.914 --> 05:37.364
And of course, a lot of the packets have to do with a lot of the traditions, a lot of the yells, a lot of that kind of stuff.

05:37.704 --> 05:43.793
That is valuable that you go through and read through just so you make sure you're not looking like a fool during the first football game, first yell practice.

05:43.813 --> 05:45.195
But also,

05:45.175 --> 05:52.823
They did give you some packets on just some easy tips on your first couple weeks at A&M, what are some good things to do.

05:52.843 --> 06:02.172
I remember getting some good sheets of good places like just to study on campus and off of campus and just some good advice to when I came in.

06:02.252 --> 06:03.634
It wasn't so foreign to me.

06:03.734 --> 06:07.477
I already had kind of an idea of what all was going to be going on.

06:08.018 --> 06:10.120
If you were the advisor to Fish Camp,

06:10.741 --> 06:15.448
is there anything you would suggest that they do more of or less of?

06:16.930 --> 06:26.744
Wow, it has been a while since I was at Fish Camp, but I think they definitely do, they did a really, really, really good job.

06:26.764 --> 06:29.728
They break you down into discussion groups, and so you're in a group of probably about

06:30.299 --> 06:35.912
I guess 10 or 15 people and really interacting with those people, finding out where everybody's coming from.

06:36.693 --> 06:38.898
And then you have two discussion leaders.

06:38.999 --> 06:39.941
They're called DG leaders.

06:40.302 --> 06:49.843
And with those two people, they really do do a good job of just kind of the personal

06:50.330 --> 07:01.743
stuff and then you do go into big groups where the whole fish camp goes into the main auditorium there at camp and they teach you a lot of stuff about campus.

07:01.843 --> 07:12.675
Now back then that was still during bonfire so they'd have all the crew chiefs of bonfire come in and really explain to you what all bonfire entailed and stuff like that and it was really cool to see that.

07:12.655 --> 07:30.767
and they'd bring some people from the Corps of Cadets to explain the different, I guess, the different branches of the Corps and just the different, like the Ross Volunteers and Parson Mellon Cavalry and different things like that to kind of teach you what the differences in the Corps are.

07:31.088 --> 07:35.035
I think definitely the one thing that I wish I would have heard a little bit more is

07:35.015 --> 07:42.410
I know there's almost 800 student organizations on campus, but there are some organizations on campus that are a lot bigger than others.

07:42.971 --> 07:48.722
Obviously the core, the fraternity system, or the Greek system as a whole, and things like that.

07:50.125 --> 07:52.129
We're still trying to, right now,

07:52.109 --> 07:57.236
be able to have Greek life, be able to go in and actually speak at Fish Camp.

07:57.336 --> 08:15.940
We've been able to go to Howdy Camp and Transfer Camp, and I've actually gotten to speak at Transfer Camp, which was a really cool opportunity, but we're still working on the Fish Camp just because they don't want to discriminate against other organizations.

08:15.920 --> 08:24.289
Still, right now, I think that it could be a little bit more universally represented when they come in and have people talk and stuff.

08:24.309 --> 08:25.751
So that's probably the one thing I'd have changed.

08:26.432 --> 08:26.632
All right.

08:26.652 --> 08:29.135
Now, here's a question which is a generational difference.

08:29.215 --> 08:29.535
All right.

08:29.575 --> 08:30.116
Years ago.

08:30.836 --> 08:37.604
When you came to enroll, how did you get here, and what all did you bring?

08:39.906 --> 08:43.210
As far as stuff that I brought in to live with, wow.

08:43.578 --> 09:04.877
well i we moved down with my roommate who had been my best friend since seventh grade um and uh we we had got uh now who is we my i my my mom and dad brought me down and my best friend's mom and dad brought them down so there's the six of us that brought us down and how many vehicles we had

09:05.853 --> 09:30.021
my car I had a pickup back then so I had my pickup and then Ryan's he had his sports utility vehicle and then of course my dad had brought down their Tahoe and then the colliers brought down I can't remember what car they brought down but so we had four cars I had loaded my folks Tahoe

09:30.760 --> 09:31.623
up pretty well.

09:31.904 --> 09:36.458
We had the U-Haul trailer attached to my dad's Tahoe.

09:36.478 --> 09:41.513
The thing was packed to the brim and I had my pickup packed to the brim as well.

09:42.033 --> 09:46.501
Of course, I mean, I had so many clothes.

09:46.841 --> 09:53.794
I swear, every year I come down with, I bring less and less clothes, especially t-shirts.

09:53.814 --> 09:55.196
And I come down with a few t-shirts.

09:55.236 --> 10:00.826
And when I leave, like my drawers this year when I came down were not full at all.

10:00.986 --> 10:02.669
And now I can't fit all my clothes.

10:03.110 --> 10:05.374
You just accrue so many.

10:05.354 --> 10:15.043
so many shirts and so I had brought down I think a little too many clothes and just a lot of stuff that I was like you know I'd like to bring that down just in case I need it

10:15.462 --> 10:18.927
Really didn't, but definitely had my computer, of course.

10:20.529 --> 10:24.134
Mom, I think, helped me go a little overboard with all the stuff.

10:24.214 --> 10:26.857
She wanted to make sure that I wasn't forgetting anything.

10:26.898 --> 10:29.020
Did you bring a television?

10:29.421 --> 10:30.322
We had a TV.

10:30.362 --> 10:34.508
We had in our dorm room what we called our Tower of Power.

10:34.528 --> 10:41.217
On one side of the room, we had our beds lined up to the back wall in the corners, and so they were parallel to each other.

10:41.652 --> 10:48.963
And in the middle, on the far wall, we had our TV on top of a dresser and on top of a little cabinet.

10:49.484 --> 10:55.554
And then in between our beds we had some shelving that we used kind of as our bedside table.

10:56.315 --> 11:00.000
And then on top of that we had our refrigerator.

11:01.022 --> 11:02.805
On top of that we had our microwave.

11:03.125 --> 11:10.056
And on top of that we had our stereo with kind of a shelf going across the microwave to where we fit our speakers.

11:10.424 --> 11:13.868
on top of that shelf with our stereo in between.

11:13.929 --> 11:15.250
So this was in what dorm?

11:15.671 --> 11:16.091
Dunn Hall.

11:16.532 --> 11:18.234
And rooms are not that big.

11:18.454 --> 11:22.319
So we were a little cramped for space, but we made do.

11:22.580 --> 11:24.502
And it was a lot of fun that year.

11:25.083 --> 11:28.247
Do you know who that dormitory is named after?

11:28.267 --> 11:29.469
Do you know anything about him?

11:29.509 --> 11:30.951
It's been a while.

11:31.211 --> 11:36.718
I remember learning a little bit about him when we first moved in, but that was about it.

11:37.306 --> 11:38.288
Thank you.

11:38.308 --> 11:39.531
Describe living in Dunhall.

11:40.494 --> 11:41.697
It was a lot of fun.

11:41.957 --> 11:46.910
I remember the wing we had.

11:46.950 --> 11:48.093
We lived on the second floor.

11:48.935 --> 11:52.203
And they had kind of two short wings and then two longer wings.

11:52.223 --> 11:53.526
And we lived on a short wing.

11:53.506 --> 11:58.054
And we became really close friends with almost everybody.

11:58.094 --> 12:01.260
Our next door neighbors, they were suites.

12:01.801 --> 12:02.903
So two rooms shared a bathroom.

12:03.424 --> 12:08.313
And our suite mates wound up becoming two of my roommates and I's best friends.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.417
And we've lived with them since freshman year.

12:11.238 --> 12:15.666
And it was a small world that they...

12:16.287 --> 12:38.245
had come from Highland Park and the two of Ryan and I had come from North Dallas so we had a lot of the same friends that kind of thing so it was just kind of a small world situation there and the other two that lived on the other side of us were also from Dallas and we knew a lot of the same people so we hit it off with them the two guys that lived across the hall we were good friends with

12:38.225 --> 12:44.813
So there was probably a group of about 10 of us that were really close just on that one wing.

12:45.635 --> 12:54.826
And I remember at least back in the fall, this was the last year, it was the fall that Bonfire had fallen.

12:55.327 --> 13:00.013
But leading up to it, we had cut weekend on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

13:00.247 --> 13:08.687
And so we'd prepare for cut weekend and it was an interesting time because they'd come at five o'clock in the morning.

13:08.971 --> 13:35.063
and start knocking on the door beating on the door they blasted a radio or their stereo wherever they were the crew chiefs were living because he had a kind of a crew chief for each floor of each dorm and so they'd come around and they'd beat on the doors you know get up time for cut get up time for cut so they'd try to recruit as many guys they could to go out there and cut and normally on saturday mornings like we were staying up pretty late on friday nights either going to the movie or

13:35.397 --> 13:59.633
goofing off or whatever so we were pretty tired on Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings of course we went to church so we never went out to cut on Sundays but still it never failed they come through about 5 5 30 in the morning yelling at us to get up I mean I remember the first morning that happened we weren't expecting it nobody told us and I remember us just woke up dead asleep and I so freaked out I had no idea what was going on we finally figured it out

13:59.613 --> 14:05.239
So we would try to sleep through it and they'd bang on our doors.

14:05.299 --> 14:21.375
I remember very vividly one Saturday morning, the RA in the hall would go outside and monitor the crew chiefs coming down, making sure they weren't doing anything irrational to any dorms or any students or anything.

14:21.995 --> 14:28.962
So I remember it was one Saturday morning, our RA, it was his vacation weekend, so he wasn't there.

14:29.144 --> 14:34.190
And I don't think RA was monitoring the hall that morning.

14:34.670 --> 14:38.875
And just so happened that our suite mates decided it would be kind of funny.

14:38.895 --> 14:43.300
We had a white board on the outside of our door to write messages and little notes and whatnot.

14:43.481 --> 14:47.405
And they had written a note on our door saying, go away.

14:47.826 --> 14:49.007
We don't want to go to your cut.

14:49.328 --> 14:50.108
Leave us alone.

14:51.590 --> 14:57.497
Just kind of taunting the crew chiefs, making it look like that we wrote it on our own door.

14:57.781 --> 15:01.669
And not having the RA that morning, they had taken axe handles.

15:02.571 --> 15:12.633
And when we moved out, we had markings all up and down our door from the beating on our door, trying to get us out of there, yelling at us so loud to get us out of that.

15:13.234 --> 15:17.443
And they were there for probably a good five, 10 minutes just yelling at us to get out.

15:17.812 --> 15:21.757
trying desperately to get into our door and get into our room.

15:22.779 --> 15:29.809
I remember wondering why they were doing that just us that morning and waking up and seeing that note on the door was quite humorous.

15:29.989 --> 15:39.482
About when, as far as you can recall, about when in terms of calendar did bonfire work began that fall?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.722
I don't know.

15:41.903 --> 15:44.306
Cut began, I think, probably mid-September.

15:46.128 --> 15:47.370
So a couple of months.

15:47.390 --> 15:55.160
A couple of months you had worth of Saturday and Sunday mornings coming around and beating on the doors and stuff.

15:55.240 --> 16:05.733
How long after you all moved into the dormitory, how long before there were any kind of pranks or jokes or hazing of freshmen or whatever?

16:05.753 --> 16:06.955
There wasn't many...

16:07.542 --> 16:10.594
things of hazing a freshman that the upperclassmen would do to us.

16:10.654 --> 16:12.381
It was more the stuff that we'd do to each other.

16:13.325 --> 16:15.915
Ah, man, it was probably,

16:16.435 --> 16:41.245
September to when probably I guess beginning to middle of September to when we heard so many stories from my dad when he was in the Corps of just little pranks that they pull on each other in the dorms and my roommate's dad had gone to West Point so we had heard a lot of stories about what they had done and of course football coaches in high school would tell us all the pranks so we had I think we had we'd taken some of those some of those good stories and

16:41.225 --> 16:42.407
try to put them to use.

16:42.807 --> 16:53.603
And I remember one of the, I think one of the first pranks that we started to pull was my roommate, and of course sharing a bathroom, he shared a shower and shared a toilet, and you had two sinks in there.

16:53.643 --> 17:02.136
Well, we decided one morning that we would try to, we heard the trick of taking the shower nozzle off and packing grape Kool-Aid.

17:02.555 --> 17:09.545
into the shower nozzle and screwing it back up there so whenever they turned on the water, it'd be Kool-Aid running out instead of just water.

17:10.045 --> 17:16.815
It didn't work too well because our suite mate normally turned on the water and let it run for a couple of minutes before he got in.

17:16.895 --> 17:21.662
By the time he got in, it was done, but he looked at the water and it was all purple in the shower.

17:21.702 --> 17:23.484
So he was kind of wondering about that.

17:23.504 --> 17:25.407
So that kind of sparked it off.

17:25.876 --> 17:26.838
We've done a lot of things.

17:26.858 --> 17:36.916
They had come over to our side of the room, one of the better pranks, and they took our mattresses with, we had our beds made, one of the few, probably a few days we had our bed made.

17:36.957 --> 17:43.629
They'd taken our beds and they'd switched the mattresses and all the pillows and everything, and they switched.

17:43.649 --> 17:45.933
They just picked it up and switched them.

17:45.953 --> 17:47.496
And my roommate and I,

17:47.476 --> 17:53.283
came in from wherever we were that night and saw our, basically our rooms had been switched.

17:53.764 --> 17:56.927
And so that was one of the better pranks.

17:56.988 --> 18:05.157
We couldn't figure out, we wondered why they spent all that time unmaking the bed and making it again, just then realizing that they had just taken the mattress off the bed.

18:05.198 --> 18:07.080
That was a good prank.

18:07.620 --> 18:12.907
One of the, I think the best pranks that we pulled were on the guys that lived across the hall from us.

18:12.967 --> 18:17.112
It was during exam week of December, so the first semester.

18:17.463 --> 18:21.187
And the guys had gone out, and they were going to a party or whatever that night.

18:22.028 --> 18:25.912
And we decided it would be fun to duct tape their door shut.

18:26.212 --> 18:29.676
And so we had a bunch of duct tape in the room, and it was red duct tape.

18:30.216 --> 18:33.019
So what we did, we started at the base of the door of the door frame.

18:33.460 --> 18:40.627
And there was a good space between the door frame went flush with the wall, and the door was kind of inset into the door frame.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.229
So there was a pretty good space.

18:42.249 --> 18:45.512
So we just started duct taping across the wall.

18:45.492 --> 18:57.082
and we had gotten it to where we got probably about a fourth of the way up and we realized it was going to take a lot more duct tape so we had gathered all the duct tape in the hall that we could and we just went about halfway up.

18:57.623 --> 19:14.318
We realized there was a good space in between the door and the doors opened in so what we did was we took all the trash from our room, dumped it in there, packed it tight, got trash from everybody else's room, started packing it tight, got into their bathroom

19:14.618 --> 19:15.599
because of their suite mates.

19:16.320 --> 19:21.987
And we wound up taping their bathroom door shut to where it was hard for them to get in with duct tape.

19:22.288 --> 19:29.257
And then we took all their toiletries, all their toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush, all that stuff, and we had duct taped it to the door.

19:29.817 --> 19:34.283
And then we went ahead and finished it off and it was completely flush of duct tape.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.146
It was just an extension of the wall.

19:36.887 --> 19:43.495
And I remember them getting home that night and we had already kind of gone to bed, but we could just hear them start to yell.

19:43.762 --> 19:48.092
And they tore down the duct tape.

19:48.112 --> 19:51.540
And when they tore down the duct tape, all the trash, of course, fell all on top of it.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.923
It was a bunch of newspapers, too.

19:52.963 --> 19:59.357
And then they got into their room and couldn't get into their bathroom because we had duct taped that shut.

19:59.437 --> 20:00.640
So they finally got into there.

20:01.092 --> 20:04.016
Woke up the next morning and they had penny jammed our door.

20:04.917 --> 20:11.686
And I fixed the door and got that done and there was just this humongous pile of trash in the hallway that we had to clean up that morning.

20:11.727 --> 20:14.330
It was one of the better pranks that we pulled.

20:15.552 --> 20:19.818
In the dining hall, what was the routine for y'all?

20:20.138 --> 20:22.341
Were there any pranks, jokes?

20:22.996 --> 20:24.519
Not as much in the dining hall.

20:24.779 --> 20:31.111
It was, especially towards the end of the year, it was more just survival to get out of the dining hall.

20:31.171 --> 20:35.679
So we wouldn't get food poisoning or anything like that.

20:35.739 --> 20:41.530
The dining hall experience was more or less just kind of get in and get out.

20:42.331 --> 20:45.898
And you all didn't use core equipment?

20:46.351 --> 21:14.856
nicknames for aggie food did you oh no sir but i have heard most of the ones that my dad had used and he would always ask me on the phone well so and so whatever and i'd be like what world are you talking about but i we had i had some good friends that were that are in the course still and when they were freshmen we they'd come eat with us when they got their nights off and so they they'd be calling it whatever and it was it was kind of fun that way uh let's talk about academics sure how did you

21:15.545 --> 21:17.868
Did you register in advance?

21:17.908 --> 21:20.211
How did your first semester courses?

21:20.231 --> 21:33.610
We had orientation over the summer, and so it was about June, and it was a three-day orientation, and on the last day of orientation, during orientation, you'd take a lot of your placement exams to where you could try to get out of some classes.

21:34.331 --> 21:38.717
So I wound up, I think, picking up three hours just taking some tests like that.

21:38.697 --> 21:47.374
And then the last morning, we had met with advisors the day before, seeing what I needed to take within our college.

21:47.658 --> 21:51.264
And then from there, you went ahead and registered for courses.

21:51.324 --> 21:56.933
That next morning, you went into the dean's office of your college, and you had an appointment at whatever time of the day.

21:57.113 --> 22:01.480
And then you went in, and they kind of helped you pick your schedule for that first semester.

22:01.540 --> 22:03.183
And you were majoring in?

22:03.203 --> 22:03.764
Geography.

22:04.204 --> 22:05.106
And that was your start?

22:05.266 --> 22:06.608
That was my start, yes, sir.

22:06.628 --> 22:10.114
And as far as you knew at that point, what was your career goal?

22:11.696 --> 22:14.661
As far as then, my career goal was...

22:15.316 --> 22:15.677
Wow.

22:16.218 --> 22:25.322
I knew I probably wanted to go to grad school, but what I wanted to do was more or less, I think, yikes, what was my career?

22:25.563 --> 22:29.072
I haven't changed my major, but I've kind of changed career goal.

22:29.592 --> 22:46.230
I think what I wanted to do was I planned on minoring in business and what I kind of wanted to do back then was wind up getting my major in geography, my minor in business and probably going on getting my MBA and doing probably some development type work.

22:46.270 --> 22:47.110
Real estate development?

22:47.531 --> 22:48.172
That kind of stuff.

22:49.153 --> 22:56.140
I've kind of continued on the same pace but as of right now I'm planning on going to law school so I've changed a little bit as far as

22:56.660 --> 22:58.665
the near future plans.

22:59.166 --> 23:06.182
Describe that first semester of going to class, describe being a freshman, academically a freshman at A&M.

23:06.863 --> 23:13.639
I still had a little bit of my high school senioritis in me the first, I think, month.

23:13.619 --> 23:19.593
Realizing that they give you a bunch of reading to do and I'd be like, oh, I can get it done later.

23:19.653 --> 23:26.108
Not really staying with my readings and staying with all the coursework that I had.

23:26.128 --> 23:31.881
I was only taking 13 hours, so it wasn't like I was taking a lot of courses.

23:31.861 --> 23:40.554
But they were, I remember going into, I'm trying to remember what my biggest class was that semester.

23:40.594 --> 23:44.841
I think I had a class, probably my biggest class was about 150 to 200 people.

23:44.861 --> 23:49.368
So I remember coming from a smaller high school, and I think our biggest class was maybe 25 or 30.

23:49.909 --> 23:56.178
It was a little bit of a change, but it wasn't anything that I wasn't, it made me uncomfortable or anything.

23:56.198 --> 23:57.741
I just sat close to the front of the room.

23:57.761 --> 23:59.944
I just remember it was,

24:00.278 --> 24:08.449
the pace of the class was going a lot faster than I thought it would, and just taking a lot of notes and realizing, wow, there's just a lot of information.

24:09.129 --> 24:11.613
And I remember the first testing period came around.

24:11.673 --> 24:19.603
Didn't do so hot because I wasn't staying with my studies like I should, but it kind of made me turn around a little bit.

24:20.005 --> 24:29.700
It was a tough first semester just because of the fact that I wasn't used to this kind of studying, this kind of learning environment.

24:29.801 --> 24:36.411
Had you gotten academic advice from your parents or a high school counselor?

24:36.391 --> 24:42.942
Well, the high school that I went to was, they prided themselves on being a college preparatory high school.

24:43.002 --> 24:47.970
So we had gotten a lot of advice as far as just like how to note take, that kind of thing.

24:48.490 --> 24:53.739
Just kind of basic skills that you will definitely need and you just kind of learn to live with in college.

24:54.079 --> 24:59.428
And got a lot of advice, especially from my parents, especially from my dad because

24:59.594 --> 25:05.324
Dad being in the business school when he was here, he had taken some finance.

25:05.484 --> 25:09.691
He, I think, wound up majoring in finance, but his first finance course he took, he failed.

25:10.172 --> 25:12.195
And it was his first semester's freshman year.

25:13.017 --> 25:18.025
And it was, he always was warning me, just be careful, stay up with your grades, whatnot.

25:18.005 --> 25:22.938
So got some good advice from the parents about that kind of stuff.

25:22.978 --> 25:27.028
And I'd taken a really great course that first semester too.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.472
It was A&M.

25:28.633 --> 25:30.979
They still offer a course called Succeeding in College.

25:31.741 --> 25:33.465
And it was, I think it was a,

25:33.715 --> 26:01.393
to our credit just course that you learn how to just the basic skills of college as your first semester and even though it doesn't count towards my degree but I do recommend any freshman coming into A&M to take some kind of course like that whether it be the summer coming in or that first semester just because a lot of the study skills we got, the reading skills, learning how to

26:01.373 --> 26:04.359
take good notes just from readings and things like that.

26:04.459 --> 26:06.423
It was very, very valuable.

26:06.503 --> 26:09.789
So I got some good information from across the board.

26:09.830 --> 26:15.380
Did you have some teachers that first year that you now think were really important to you?

26:15.400 --> 26:16.182
Yes, sir.

26:16.623 --> 26:17.745
We had...

26:18.468 --> 26:24.540
Let's see, I kept in touch, especially my spring semester.

26:25.903 --> 26:35.042
I had taken my first geography class in the fall and I took my second geography class in the spring.

26:35.933 --> 26:48.441
The professor's name was Dr. Bednarz, and he taught economic geography, and he specialized more in the urban side of geography, the side that I was really looking to do and really wanted to be involved with.

26:48.501 --> 26:52.390
So I remember going in, talking to him a little bit,

26:52.808 --> 26:55.951
really getting to know him fairly well.

26:55.991 --> 26:59.734
And I've wound up taking three classes from him since I've been at A&M.

26:59.794 --> 27:02.036
And just a good, valuable resource.

27:02.056 --> 27:07.781
I've gone into him to talk to him about possible internships and future plans and that kind of thing.

27:08.062 --> 27:15.649
I've also talked to another professor a little bit here and there, was my first geography professor, Dr. Igor Vonovic.

27:16.649 --> 27:21.714
And he really does specialize in city, like kind of city geography.

27:21.734 --> 27:22.815
How do you spell his name?

27:22.795 --> 27:25.703
Is it a B or a V?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.207
V, V-O-J.

27:28.290 --> 27:32.462
It was Russian sounding last name, but he was from Canada.

27:34.247 --> 27:37.817
But just talking to him a little bit here and there in my freshman year, just about

27:37.797 --> 27:40.521
advice on what to do and that kind of thing.

27:40.561 --> 27:50.394
So he helped me a lot I think my first semester there and especially my succeeding in college teacher.

27:51.395 --> 27:53.237
He's now one of the athletic advisors.

27:54.459 --> 27:58.945
Rodney Paris was a very very very valuable resource that I had back then.

27:58.925 --> 28:01.409
Describe a typical academic day.

28:01.510 --> 28:04.675
What time did you get up, and what did you do when?

28:04.695 --> 28:13.170
Normally, I think I had class starting about 9 o'clock every day, so I'd probably wake up about 7.30, 7.45ish, so it wasn't

28:13.420 --> 28:32.043
It was a little bit later than I always used to in high school, but the big thing was I wasn't used to staying up as late as I had in high school my first semester just because you always had people around and you were going to bed probably 12, 1, 2 o'clock in the morning just not even thinking about it.

28:32.063 --> 28:33.825
It was like a big slumber party all the time.

28:33.805 --> 28:42.058
And waking up that early in the morning, we'll use those in quotes, was a little bit more difficult, but we, I mean, get up.

28:42.199 --> 28:47.427
I had normally, Monday, Wednesday, Friday classes were shorter than the Tuesday, Thursday.

28:48.328 --> 28:51.173
And, well, of course, they still are.

28:51.828 --> 29:14.005
you go to i i had i think about two or three classes on monday wednesday friday in the morning um yeah you'd go to breakfast i go i go to breakfast i'd go down and go to breakfast and then come back i'd shower go to breakfast and then come back upstairs and get my books and then either ride my bike off the class or walk into class and then i go to my first couple classes and come back and normally uh

29:13.985 --> 29:37.765
about I guess it was probably about 12 30 everybody was kind of finishing up their morning classes because freshman year seemed to be almost everybody had the same schedule so you kind of were on the same routine we come back eat lunch with the roommates and suite mates and stuff and normally one day a week we'd go off campus to go eat lunch but normally we'd go downstairs and maybe go grab chick-fil-a or

29:38.200 --> 29:54.124
something like that, or go down into the cafeteria, grab lunch, and then in the afternoon we had, I had my kinesiology was weightlifting, so we'd go, I'd go to weightlifting, I guess it was probably mid-afternoon, and then after that we'd head to the rec center.

29:55.366 --> 30:02.738
I'd finish my weightlifting that I didn't get finished in class, and then we'd go either play basketball or racquetball or go.

30:02.758 --> 30:03.198
Just for fun.

30:03.298 --> 30:05.001
Just for fun, go swimming in the pool.

30:05.167 --> 30:10.216
just in time to come back, shower, go down to dinner.

30:11.058 --> 30:20.715
We probably ate dinner, I'm guessing, around 6.30 or 7, and then come back upstairs and either study or think about studying and watch TV.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.941
In fact, I had a lot of meetings and stuff.

30:24.181 --> 30:27.968
How easy was it to study in the room in terms of noise in the dorm?

30:28.876 --> 30:31.661
Studying in the room wasn't that bad as far as noise went.

30:31.681 --> 30:33.364
There was just so many distractions in the room.

30:33.644 --> 30:43.681
You had your TV, you had, we had, of course, so many people would just always come into the room, because everybody had their door open, so anybody that walked by would stop by and say hi.

30:44.342 --> 30:47.307
And of course, you had your computer there, and so there was always,

30:47.287 --> 30:53.100
room to go on the internet and dork around or play computer games on the computer or whatnot.

30:53.140 --> 30:56.388
So normally when I'd go study, we had study carrels at the end of each hall.

30:56.749 --> 31:02.562
So I'd either go down to the study carrel and study where I got a lot of good studying done there, or I'd go off to the library.

31:02.542 --> 31:05.665
and go study that because I'm still the same way.

31:05.765 --> 31:13.673
It's tough for me to study within my room just because I have so many things there that I can always be doing and distract me so I need to sometimes go off and study on my own.

31:13.713 --> 31:16.395
I went outside a lot when the weather was nice and studied out there.

31:16.635 --> 31:18.317
What did you and your buddies wear to class?

31:18.397 --> 31:19.999
How did you dress?

31:21.020 --> 31:29.087
I dressed fairly just I mean wore a lot of just polo shirts and khaki shorts and stuff.

31:29.107 --> 31:31.890
I think the more time went on the more comfortable.
