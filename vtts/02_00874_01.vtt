00:03.102 --> 00:05.509
This is Tuesday, August 18, 1987. I'm Bob Cornish, 
and I'm in the office of Kent Butler. Kent is

00:11.145 --> 00:16.521
currently on leave from the University of Texas 
Department of Urban Planning. community and

00:18.003 --> 00:25.510
regional planning, that is, with the Lower 
Colorado River Authority. And Kent, let's take a

00:26.651 --> 00:36.720
look first of all at what you were doing when you 
were on the UT planning faculty. I'd like to ask you

00:37.881 --> 00:46.069
first what you did to be eligible to join the 
faculty. What was your background academically,

00:46.707 --> 00:58.527
and where did you do this sort of thing, and where 
did you, where were you located before coming to UT

00:46.707 --> 00:58.527
and so forth? Okay, well, my first college 
training was at Penn, University of

00:58.547 --> 01:09.225
Pennsylvania, and I got turned on to planning 
and... When were you there? In the late 60s and

01:10.906 --> 01:15.352
early 70s, actually just two years, 69 through 71. 
I see. That was about three or four years after I was

01:16.814 --> 01:19.658
there. Oh, okay. Well, I was there at the vertex of 
the environmental movement. Earth Day, original

01:28.189 --> 01:36.981
Earth Day, 1970, was right in the middle of my first 
college experience. Well, that must have made

01:37.484 --> 01:41.050
quite an impression on you as a student, then, in 
planning. Well, I started out in the Wharton

01:41.891 --> 02:01.264
School of Finance, and I quickly got dismayed by 
the gray flannel suits and the piqued interest of

01:41.891 --> 02:01.264
all of my student colleagues in marketing theory 
and things that had no sense of social importance

01:41.891 --> 02:01.264
to me. At the same time, the city was alive with 
environmental concerns. And the most outspoken

02:06.281 --> 02:11.288
person that I could get to was Ian McCarg. And his 
program was in its heyday of teaching the whole

02:12.229 --> 02:22.723
concept of design with nature as people talk about 
it today. So I took a course from McCarg and started

02:28.733 --> 02:34.322
the first undergraduate degree program in 
landscape architecture and regional planning at

02:28.733 --> 02:34.322
Penn. A combined degree? Yes, it was an 
individualized major at the undergraduate

02:37.326 --> 02:43.115
level, and there were no undergraduate degrees 
there. But I quickly got frustrated by the fact

02:43.897 --> 02:51.608
that that was an exceptional graduate school with 
little to offer in terms of undergraduate

02:43.897 --> 02:51.608
coursework. So as much as I was turned on to the 
program there I had to leave in order to get proper

02:57.100 --> 03:07.916
scientific training if I was to follow my 
instincts and become an environmental planner.

03:08.898 --> 03:15.408
So I transferred to the Institute for 
Environmental Studies at the University of

03:08.898 --> 03:15.408
Wisconsin-Madison. And there I stayed for seven 
years. I got a bachelor's degree in environmental

03:20.516 --> 03:25.403
science, a master's degree in water resources 
management, and a PhD in land resources. All those

03:32.176 --> 03:37.583
degrees were multidisciplinary, 
interdepartmental in nature. And I was able to

03:38.584 --> 03:50.239
develop

03:38.584 --> 03:50.239
a scientifically based degree in resources 
management and planning. I should think so.

03:52.202 --> 03:54.765
Pretty strong academic background for The work 
you're doing right now, for example. Yeah. I was

03:59.684 --> 04:07.775
training myself to be working in the area of water 
resources, coastal land management. I know

04:07.795 --> 04:12.462
you've had a lot of interest in that, California 
days and so on. But no, I don't have the background,

04:12.482 --> 04:15.907
academic background in it that you have. And my 
advisor was took a leave of absence while I was

04:19.838 --> 04:28.227
working on my PhD and became the state planner, the 
director of planning and energy for Wisconsin.

04:28.247 --> 04:39.679
Being a progressive state to begin with, I was able 
to get employment for two of the years I was in

04:28.247 --> 04:39.679
school with the state planning and energy office. 
I worked on the Wisconsin coastal program. So I had

04:42.421 --> 04:45.385
some kind of experience in Madison. In Madison, 
yes. Convenient. Yeah. So I had just a dabbling of

04:48.813 --> 05:17.672
the practical public sector planning experience 
as well as my academic work, and I was also able to

04:48.813 --> 05:17.672
work on some large-scale research projects, 
complete some research, and actually as a sort of a

04:48.813 --> 05:17.672
post-doctoral experience, I directed a research 
project on the use of science and technology

04:48.813 --> 05:17.672
information in the governor's office, 
scientific and technological research.

05:18.074 --> 05:31.470
advisory roles of the various cabinet agencies 
advising the governor in Wisconsin, how it works

05:18.074 --> 05:31.470
from a decision-making process point of view. So 
at the end of that experience, I decided to go back

05:32.671 --> 05:45.286
to academia so that I could continue research and 
begin teaching. But I had little teaching

05:45.306 --> 05:47.929
experience before that. But you knew you wanted to 
teach. Yes, teach and do research in a very applied

05:51.185 --> 05:58.294
sense. And I sought positions. I had two or three 
offers. But having grown up in Houston, having all

06:06.284 --> 06:17.578
my family and my wife's family in Houston, and 
always having a fond regard for Austin, A job that

06:18.402 --> 06:33.495
opened up there that had tremendous flexibility 
and growth potential was a certain combination

06:18.402 --> 06:33.495
that I thought was the right thing for me at the 
time. So there I went in 78 and stayed through 86 and

06:33.515 --> 06:43.083
now I'm at LCRA. Okay. When you were at UT, What 
courses were you responsible for? Well I ran, I

06:54.259 --> 07:11.629
headed up the environmental planning curriculum 
and in that area I taught courses in techniques of

06:54.259 --> 07:11.629
environmental analysis, which you might say are 
the physical planning techniques as well as

07:12.773 --> 07:15.497
environmental analysis techniques. I taught 
seminars, research seminars in environmental

07:15.517 --> 07:22.126
policy, environmental legislation.

07:24.870 --> 07:34.164
I taught specialized courses such as coastal zone 
management and water resources management. And

07:34.184 --> 07:42.696
then I also taught planning methods, which was a 
combination of physical planning and the various

07:43.300 --> 07:54.947
social science analysis techniques that 
planners use in terms of making population

07:43.300 --> 07:54.947
projections and economic based analysis and the 
like. I think Sandy does that sometimes, doesn't

07:55.602 --> 07:59.228
she? Yeah. In fact, in the last couple of years that 
I was teaching that course, Sandy and I would

07:59.488 --> 08:04.357
co-teach the course. We'd actually split the 
program into smaller classes so that we would

08:05.078 --> 08:18.420
teach two classes at a time so that we'd have a more 
close working relationship with the students to

08:05.078 --> 08:18.420
make it more of a hands-on experience. I did a lot of 
research. I think from the second semester I was

08:21.075 --> 08:29.885
there until the last semester, over seven years, I 
had funded research consistently throughout

08:21.075 --> 08:29.885
that period. And I felt lucky to be as successful as 
I was to have ongoing contract monies that allowed

08:29.905 --> 08:47.226
me to work in the summer, to engage a lot of 
students, to keep my my time focused on some

08:47.915 --> 08:52.260
current topical issues. Most of the research was 
in the area of either coastal zone management or

08:53.161 --> 08:59.569
water resources management. But in the last 
couple of years I was there, I was more involved in

08:59.589 --> 09:05.235
urban growth management. I spent a lot of time. 
Well, you wrote an article for Hunting Magazine on

09:09.801 --> 09:16.709
growth management in Austin, as I recall. Yeah, in 
ADA General. In the journal? Yeah. That article

09:22.218 --> 09:36.878
had to do with negotiated growth management, 
which is getting into the area of negotiation and

09:22.218 --> 09:36.878
mediation, development agreements, an area 
which I had some opportunities to do some

09:22.218 --> 09:36.878
practical work as well. I just saw, before I got 
here, you opened Dick Lilly, as I was getting out of

09:39.121 --> 09:46.210
my car, and we stopped and chatted. Just 
coincidentally? Of course, he's looking for

09:48.023 --> 09:55.613
things to do now that Barnes Connolly had gone 
bankrupt.

09:58.697 --> 10:04.845
Did he tell you that he used to teach a 
comprehensive planning course once a year? I knew

10:05.787 --> 10:06.227
that. Three or four years. And when I thought about 
it, I remembered what I asked him when he was a guest

10:08.050 --> 10:16.461
speaker at my class in comprehensive planning at 
A&M. I asked him when Austin was going to come up

10:17.183 --> 10:21.728
with a comprehensive plan. And he looked at me very 
seriously and said, I'm not sure we could ever do

10:22.729 --> 10:26.292
one. And I subsequently had reason to believe him 
after seeing the Austin Tomorrow Plan. You know,

10:34.881 --> 10:38.105
it's funny how things work. His course always came 
down in the last six weeks on a studio project which

10:38.125 --> 10:46.093
addressed prototypical, comprehensively 
planned, very large-scale development in

10:46.580 --> 10:52.707
southwest Austin. And when he left the city, he 
went to work for Barnes Connolly to essentially

10:54.790 --> 11:08.186
manage the development of the Uplands Project, 
which was a four and a half thousand acre project in

10:54.790 --> 11:08.186
southwest Austin. Interesting.

11:13.310 --> 11:29.230
Looking back from your perspective now here at the 
River Authority toward the UT Planning Program,

11:13.310 --> 11:29.230
how would you characterize it?

11:29.250 --> 11:37.461
Well, the program has a very energetic faculty and 
has been able to maintain a very a stable size and

11:38.150 --> 11:47.086
high quality student body.

11:48.308 --> 12:03.094
It's always been a program that reached out to the 
other departments on the campus, trying whenever

11:48.308 --> 12:03.094
possible to complement its teaching 
capabilities with other departmental

12:03.817 --> 12:18.577
capabilities and giving a lot of flexibility to 
students to tailor programs

12:03.817 --> 12:18.577
to their desires and building upon their prior 
experiences.

12:21.080 --> 12:33.216
The thrust of the program, I think, has been 
primarily in the area of policy planning with a

12:21.080 --> 12:33.216
strong quantitative methods requirement. I 
compare it to the A&M planning program, which

12:34.107 --> 12:52.095
relative to the main thrust of the UT planning 
program is perhaps known more so for its physical

12:34.107 --> 12:52.095
planning capabilities. But that's not to say that 
one is solely strong in one and the other in the

12:53.838 --> 12:58.545
other. I think that's one distinction that I've 
often heard made, and I think there's some truth to

12:59.133 --> 13:05.721
it. But the program has always been, I

13:08.024 --> 13:27.469
guess you'd say, lean and mean compared to the 
other larger planning programs throughout the

13:08.024 --> 13:27.469
country, which have higher faculty to student 
ratios, more faculty.

13:28.647 --> 13:46.179
I think the faculty have always

13:28.647 --> 13:46.179
distinguished themselves from the architecture 
school within which it resides by having a very

13:28.647 --> 13:46.179
active and important research program. I think 
that, as is always the case, there's two or three

13:46.199 --> 13:50.487
faculty that really make that happen. Sandy is 
certainly the leader in terms of bringing in some

13:53.691 --> 14:01.680
significant research. Pat Wilson has been very 
active in research, and I was too. I think we

14:10.091 --> 14:16.359
probably represented,

14:10.091 --> 14:16.359
and then when Del Myers was there, he did too. But 
counting those of us that I just mentioned, we

14:16.379 --> 14:21.385
probably represented 90% of the the active, 
funded research. But that was always considered

14:24.850 --> 14:30.415
an important part of the academic program. Either 
by employment or by informal means, such as

14:30.835 --> 14:39.905
running a research seminar, we brought that 
research into the classroom. And again, a lot of

14:42.367 --> 14:49.414
that was policy planning, applied policy 
analysis. as opposed to physical planning.

14:55.933 --> 15:09.411
I did my share and Peter Coleman did some share of 
physical planning practicums, workshops, under

14:55.933 --> 15:09.411
contract with local governments in the state. We 
did, I guess, in the seven years I was there, we

15:11.652 --> 15:20.267
probably did six or seven of those types of 
physical planning projects. And they were

15:21.149 --> 15:26.198
generally quite successful, but I don't think 
those were our strengths. I think those were

15:26.218 --> 15:32.108
essential complements in an overall planning 
program.

15:36.458 --> 16:02.398
what um one more thing i think the program has 
always at least up until the last year or two

15:36.458 --> 16:02.398
maintained a very special and essential 
relationship with the city of austin through a

15:36.458 --> 16:02.398
combination of informal linkages and formal 
linkages to allow the students to take advantage

15:36.458 --> 16:02.398
of the wonderful laboratory that Austin 
represents. At one time, when I was running the

16:05.792 --> 16:30.462
intern program, we had as many as 17 interns 
working at the City of Austin at one time, and other

16:05.792 --> 16:30.462
interns were working in other places, but that 
just is an example of the level of commitment back

16:05.792 --> 16:30.462
and forth that was made to make Austin the planning 
lab for the program, and for the program to be a

16:30.847 --> 16:37.637
research arm of the city of Austin. Has that 
changed recently? Well, it's changed quite a bit

16:40.120 --> 16:45.708
because of the economy in the 1986 and 87. The 
employment capabilities of the city have gotten

16:45.728 --> 16:58.727
negative, as have very many cities, so that 
program is still working, but in large part it's

16:59.298 --> 17:04.423
interns on a voluntary basis, or a nominal 
remuneration basis. Whereas it used to be that the

17:04.443 --> 17:09.148
interns were paid more than the graduate research 
assistants. And so we inadvertently did so well

17:09.849 --> 17:20.420
that we lost some of our better students in terms of 
their research potential to the intern program.

17:22.462 --> 17:26.706
But the city also, through the informal context, 
primarily through Terry Kahn and myself, and Dal

17:28.053 --> 17:54.583
Myers when he was there, used the university 
planning program as a research arm extensively,

17:28.053 --> 17:54.583
serving on boards and commissions, advising city 
council members on long-term planning issues,

17:56.251 --> 18:11.644
Just maintaining that informal, peer-level 
dialogue with the planning professionals and the

17:56.251 --> 18:11.644
sovereign body of the city was something we always 
were very proud of and spent a lot of time doing.

18:12.385 --> 18:19.852
Kent, we're now going to switch subjects, and this 
will not be under planning education for the

18:12.385 --> 18:19.852
transcriber. This will be under various cities 
that you've been working with in the recent past.

18:27.993 --> 18:36.565
Okay, let me get into this through sort of an 
autobiographical storytelling.

18:39.489 --> 18:55.030
Having a background in water resources, I was 
taken with a monograph or a book that was written

18:39.489 --> 18:55.030
about ten years ago by three guys from Harvard, and 
the book is was fairly popular at the time, and it's

18:55.195 --> 18:58.599
called Land Use and the Pipe. And a sewer by any 
other name, you may say. And essentially the

19:04.846 --> 19:17.440
thrust of that book and the thrust of the story it 
was telling along the lines of

19:19.073 --> 19:35.030
the role of infrastructure in urban planning, is 
that notwithstanding roads, sewer and water

19:19.073 --> 19:35.030
lines are the veins and arteries of urban growth 
and suburban development. And to that extent, I

19:36.392 --> 19:45.942
took a particular interest in the planning 
dimensions of infrastructure, particularly

19:36.392 --> 19:45.942
water and wastewater systems. and I had just 
enough training to be able to really be conversant

19:46.597 --> 19:55.915
with the civil engineering profession and enough 
background in finance to understand a little of

19:56.502 --> 20:05.557
the financial dimensions of financing 
infrastructure. And through voluntary work in

20:05.577 --> 20:21.244
the city of Austin, I helped organize the city's 
Water and Wastewater Commission, which is an

20:05.577 --> 20:21.244
advisory body with some sovereign powers on which 
I served for four years. And that commission

20:21.545 --> 20:28.095
reviewed virtually every water and wastewater 
approach line that was connected to the city. And

20:29.036 --> 20:43.317
more importantly, along the lines of the 
practical planning work that I've done as a

20:29.036 --> 20:43.317
consultant, I reviewed and was involved in the 
decision making on the creation of muds.

20:44.039 --> 20:48.365
municipal utility districts in the Austin 
jurisdiction. In fact, while serving on that

20:48.385 --> 21:01.544
commission, I reviewed and was very heavily 
involved in the decisions to approve or deny some

20:48.385 --> 21:01.544
23 muds in the Austin area. And I was involved to the 
extent that council members would ask me to join

21:01.564 --> 21:12.780
them in the final early morning negotiation 
meetings with the mud developers and engineers

21:01.564 --> 21:12.780
and attorneys on the day of the council meeting 
when the consent agreement would be finally moved

21:13.250 --> 21:30.071
and adopted, which would then authorize the mud to 
be created and the city to engage in joint

21:13.250 --> 21:30.071
participation in some of the infrastructure. And 
to give you the scale of the significance of this,

21:31.492 --> 21:41.785
one project that I was involved in included $67 
million worth of water and wastewater

21:31.492 --> 21:41.785
improvements. One particular mud. All told, 
there were over $800 million worth of water and

21:44.266 --> 21:59.619
wastewater improvements approved by the city 
that would be tied into the city utility as part of

21:44.266 --> 21:59.619
the build-out of these mud developments. And I 
learned a lot about the legal and institutional

21:59.639 --> 22:13.851
and financial dimensions of municipal utility 
districts and their role vis-a-vis cities. This

22:14.506 --> 22:18.331
was about the time that the Austin Tomorrow Plan 
was being formulated, wasn't it? Well, it really

22:18.772 --> 22:21.155
came out on the coattails of that. I became 
involved in this in 1980, and the Austin Tomorrow

22:21.656 --> 22:31.009
Plan was approved in 1980, finally approved in 
1980. And these muds were in response to a lot of the

22:31.029 --> 22:43.146
decisions by the city not to extend utility lines, 
not to allow the pipe to determine where the city

22:43.683 --> 22:46.248
would grow. And as a result, the city began to grow 
by a process of negotiated growth management. And

22:55.505 --> 22:58.731
that's the story I try to tell in that article in the 
APA journal. As a result of that experience, I was

23:03.140 --> 23:06.970
asked to help other cities in the same regard. The 
runaway story of muds in Houston was being played

23:07.852 --> 23:17.115
out again in Austin. And it was beginning to happen 
in other cities as well. The first city that I was

23:20.774 --> 23:35.848
asked to help in a position of negotiating the 
decision to approve or deny and if to approve under

23:20.774 --> 23:35.848
what terms to approve MUDS was in Missouri City. 
And Missouri City is an interesting city because

23:37.129 --> 23:43.315
it is in many ways the epitome of Houston. And I 
mention that because of your research on Houston.

23:47.302 --> 23:58.638
Missouri City, not only because of the parkland 
dedication decisions is famous, is also famous

23:47.302 --> 23:58.638
because of the role of municipal utility 
districts. The city has no water utility. The city

24:00.861 --> 24:02.724
has no wastewater utility. But it has some 35,000 
people. It has 19 LUDs within the city limits of

24:06.309 --> 24:10.915
Missouri City. As a result, they They have an 
extremely inefficient and expensive

24:15.365 --> 24:21.432
infrastructure. The planning director called me 
one day and asked me to... Who was that? Wayne...

24:26.037 --> 24:27.318
Snyder. No. Newman. Newman. Yeah, he's a former 
student of mine. Yeah. Yeah, he was. And he...

24:35.407 --> 24:45.017
Well, the city had just received the final report 
of a comprehensive engineering analysis of how

24:45.520 --> 24:50.828
could the city begin to consolidate all of these 
independent utilities. And the report suggested

24:52.129 --> 25:03.165
that they begin to dissolve the muds within the 
middle of the city and to take over the debt and

24:52.129 --> 25:03.165
begin to put them together into a centralized 
utility system. Who made that report, do you know?

25:09.915 --> 25:10.015
Yeah. Outside consulting firm? Outside 
engineering consulting firm. All right. very

25:13.769 --> 25:16.932
well-known firm in Houston. It was Pate 
Engineers, Jerry Pate and Associates. I see. At

25:22.458 --> 25:32.509
any rate, they asked me to look at it because of my 
knowledge about muds and the decision-making

25:22.458 --> 25:32.509
that go into mud approvals and the like. And I 
looked at the report and I came to an interesting

25:33.530 --> 25:40.097
conclusion. And I told them that I really felt that 
they needed to understand my conclusion in some

25:40.600 --> 25:51.492
detail because it didn't make sense to them at 
first. My suggestion was that they not dissolve

25:52.013 --> 26:04.347
any muds within the city, but rather begin 
negotiating with any new muds on the fringe of the

25:52.013 --> 26:04.347
city to begin to tie them into a regional system. 
And the thrust there is that planning activity

26:04.367 --> 26:10.033
generally occurs where growth is occurring at the 
fringe, and the degree to which investment

26:10.368 --> 26:30.881
capital can be marshalled and directed to be of 
benefit to the public at large as well as the

26:10.368 --> 26:30.881
entrepreneur, then the spirit of a 
public-private partnership can be had. And

26:32.023 --> 26:37.472
literally within a week of my making a series of 
recommendations along those lines, Along came

26:38.026 --> 26:40.609
four new mud applications in the city. And to make a 
long story short, I was hired by the city to review

26:42.231 --> 27:06.177
and negotiate the approval of those four new muds 
to create a city utility which would allow those

26:42.231 --> 27:06.177
muds to be created but which would require the 
water and wastewater improvements to be

26:42.231 --> 27:06.177
constructed by those muds to be dedicated to the 
city. for ownership and operation with

27:07.169 --> 27:18.144
appropriate financial transactions to make it 
beneficial for the mud developers. And so I began

27:19.165 --> 27:26.916
working with the city over a period of just three 
months to develop consent agreements the four new

27:26.896 --> 27:47.398
muds representing a tremendous amount of 
development on the fringe of the city that were

27:26.896 --> 27:47.398
strategically located to put in a regional 
wastewater plant that would, over the course of

27:26.896 --> 27:47.398
years, be able to take over the operation of all the 
other muds inside the heart of the city. And I think

27:49.180 --> 27:53.224
that is an example of

27:54.841 --> 28:20.612
regional utilities infrastructure planning 
that makes sense economically that an engineer

27:54.841 --> 28:20.612
may not normally come to the same conclusion and 
that deals directly with what houston is having to

27:54.841 --> 28:20.612
face and i literally just coincidentally happen 
to have a article written by some members of

27:54.841 --> 28:20.612
houston mud boards on their concept of 
regionalization, which is exactly what we're

28:21.385 --> 28:25.909
talking about. Here's a series of seven muds on 
this figure I'm showing you that all decided to tie

28:25.969 --> 28:31.475
together. And another example of three or four 
muds that decided to put in a regional plant and

28:33.237 --> 28:42.345
take advantage of the economy of scale. Nothing 
unusual for planters to think that way and look at a

28:43.827 --> 28:50.093
larger area-wide issue, What is surprising to me 
now in the Puget Sound area is that it's the public

28:50.714 --> 29:07.252
that is demanding economies and government, and 
they are insisting in regionalization and the

28:50.714 --> 29:07.252
dissolution of local units of government. It's 
front page stuff in the Seattle paper. Large

29:13.218 --> 29:15.561
feature articles on it frequently now. It's 
continuing pressure. Well, the unique character

29:20.549 --> 29:38.788
of this particular planning experience, I think, 
was the combination of the infrastructure

29:20.549 --> 29:38.788
planning and the multi-jurisdictional element, 
coupled with the need to develop, to utilize

29:20.549 --> 29:38.788
negotiation skills. Someone who understood and 
had the respect of both sides, the city and the

29:39.949 --> 29:46.776
engineers and the developers and the financial 
advisors. and who could see the benefits for both

29:47.178 --> 29:52.364
sides of a negotiated solution. Later, I was hired 
by the city of San Marcos, which is in the Austin

29:53.746 --> 30:11.667
metropolitan district area, to do the same thing, 
to review two mud applications and to serve as

29:53.746 --> 30:11.667
negotiator for the city to allow those muds to be 
created but to create an expanded city-owned and

30:12.625 --> 30:16.590
operated utility. And after an arduous task of six 
months in length, four months were in fact created

30:17.632 --> 30:35.236
with the approval of the city to create a new 
regional wastewater and water system on the

30:17.632 --> 30:35.236
northern side of San Marcos back towards Austin. 
It was a $42 million

30:35.256 --> 30:40.303
package of agreements which, although it's not a 
lot of money by the scale of a metropolitan

30:41.009 --> 30:49.681
community, was a vast sum of money for a town of 
35,000 people.

30:51.744 --> 30:59.695
And along the same lines, I was almost immediately 
after that asked to help the city of McKinney,

30:51.744 --> 30:59.695
which is in the Dallas metro area. Actually in,

31:00.697 --> 31:05.143
I forget the county.

31:07.891 --> 31:10.575
It's not Dallas County, it's the next county up. 
Anyway, the city of McKinney was not just

31:10.595 --> 31:33.325
approached, but woke up one morning reading in the 
newspapers that while each Ross Perot had

31:10.595 --> 31:33.325
proclaimed victory in advance of having 
purchased the Flying M Ranch, six and a half

31:10.595 --> 31:33.325
thousand acre ranch just north of Dallas, just on 
the outskirts of McKinney, right in the area of

31:33.980 --> 31:41.449
Sherman and the future Saturn plant.

31:45.695 --> 31:58.671
While H. Ruff slept that night, Gibraltar Savings 
at 11 p.m. consummated a purchase of the Flying M

31:45.695 --> 31:58.671
Ranch for something like $175 million cash. and 
had assembled a team of planners and attorneys and

32:00.338 --> 32:15.428
landscape architects representing some 30 
professionals to carry this project to

32:00.338 --> 32:15.428
completion and to work with
