WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:08.812
smaller towns to be from farming or ranching 
families, some wealthy, some not. And so there

00:09.653 --> 00:14.939
was, so that dichotomy was there too, I think. Were 
y'all, you were proud to be a part of the

00:17.262 --> 00:20.746
transition. Did you hear anybody complaining 
about A&M going to the dogs or this being, did most

00:21.266 --> 00:29.756
people think this was progress, these changes? 
Most people did. However, we would

00:32.768 --> 00:47.049
talk of an old ag someplace who just thought that 
the presence of women on campus had just made

00:32.768 --> 00:47.049
everything go to hell. We knew there were those 
voices out there. We didn't pay much attention to

00:49.713 --> 00:52.257
them. And y'all learned Aggie jokes. Oh, yes. All 
that. Oh, yeah. And how soon did you and your

00:59.718 --> 01:10.122
transition friends, meaning part of a 
transition, how soon before you all felt Aggie

00:59.718 --> 01:10.122
pride? First day we were there. Did you ever think 
about transferring? Not for a heartbeat. I

01:17.757 --> 01:18.958
couldn't imagine if gone. That never crossed my 
mind. What about the people around you in the

01:20.500 --> 01:22.803
dorms? They were there. They were committed. They 
were there for the duration. And there was a good

01:26.808 --> 01:29.251
survival rate academically? Yes. Yes. As far as 
you knew, were the admission requirements about

01:31.254 --> 01:35.800
in order then? Were they about appropriate for A&M 
standards? I think so. If you... Anybody that

01:43.089 --> 01:46.633
really wanted to go there pretty much got in, I 
think, from... that was not selective at all.

01:56.003 --> 01:56.744
Trivia for you. Before the Aspirations Report, 
one of the things we recommended was to start

01:57.987 --> 02:03.879
moving the admission requirements up. The 
official admission requirements until 1963 or 4

02:08.855 --> 02:12.580
other than being white and male, you had to have a 
diploma. Nothing about grades, courses, class

02:12.600 --> 02:15.645
rank, scores or anything. No felony convictions 
and no communicable diseases. That's all it was.

02:23.055 --> 02:27.902
So, obviously, we had a high flunk rate because 
there were people that couldn't make it. And what I

02:28.242 --> 02:35.132
want to ask all the experts today who say, we need to 
do this, that, okay, how many people can this

02:35.112 --> 02:37.216
institution best serve? What should be the 
appropriate number? We've got far, far, far more

02:39.862 --> 02:42.587
than that applying. Yes. Then on what basis do we 
select who gets to be here? When I ran into that in

02:47.277 --> 02:52.227
Missouri and I had our registrar, I said, have the 
machine print out for us What did a student need

02:52.662 --> 03:02.734
here in combination of high school record and test 
score, ACT and SAT, to have a high likelihood of a

02:52.662 --> 03:02.734
two-point at the end of the first? And what we 
found, top quarter of both all the test scores and

03:03.434 --> 03:15.328
high school, if you're not in the top quarter of 
both, only on probation, unless you went to one of

03:15.882 --> 03:21.347
the very, very, very, very, very selective prep 
schools in Kansas City or St. Louis. Like if we were

03:22.388 --> 03:24.930
in the second quarter, Kincaid. Yes, yes. That 
makes a big difference. Yeah, or Country Day or a

03:28.132 --> 03:30.054
place like that. And that's a tough one, a tough one 
for this here. What were the attitudes about the

03:35.279 --> 03:45.147
point of view, the philosophy of these students, 
your colleagues and their families? What,

03:46.595 --> 03:48.922
liberal, conservative? I would say fairly 
conservative. I remember the Carter Ford

03:53.134 --> 04:00.115
election. happened when I was on campus. And if 
there was anybody on campus that supported Jimmy

04:04.230 --> 04:12.306
Carter, I don't remember who it was. I

04:12.326 --> 04:21.765
remember everybody was in favor of Ford, whether 
you were a Republican or not. So it was pretty

04:22.505 --> 04:32.678
conservative, no anti-war sentiment, 
patriotic, ambitious. Kids wanted to go to

04:34.320 --> 04:37.184
graduate school, kids wanted to go to 
professional school. The women of my core group of

04:38.966 --> 04:43.011
kids four or five women that I've remained close 
to. I'm a physician. One's an attorney. One is a

04:51.559 --> 04:55.243
retailer in New York City. One is a high school 
teacher. One is an entrepreneur. None of us had

05:01.510 --> 05:03.212
kids right out of college. Only one married right 
out of college. We definitely were not there for

05:07.966 --> 05:10.129
our MRS degrees. And, you know, have really all 
been very successful. A couple of the women never

05:14.413 --> 05:15.855
had kids. So it was... Were there any majors that 
you and your closest friends kind of looked down

05:19.519 --> 05:24.505
on? Yeah, the wildlife fisheries majors, some of 
the ag majors. were like, well, okay, yeah. Do your

05:35.943 --> 05:39.227
thing and that's fine, but. In the term, in the 
meaning of the term diversity as we now use it, how

05:39.587 --> 05:46.195
diverse was the student body then? It wasn't 
diverse at all. The, you know, there were white

05:49.079 --> 05:53.144
students and black athletes. You know, Fred 
McClure was a real. What about Hispanic?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.295
Hardly any. International students? A few, but 
they were mostly graduate students. Jewish? Not

06:07.363 --> 06:09.065
many. But those that were here, did anybody think 
less of them? I don't think so. Religion

06:15.694 --> 06:21.221
was not a big issue at that point in time. Were there 
religious activities that you and your friends

06:21.642 --> 06:25.888
participated in? Not really. I went to church a 
couple of times. And this is from someone who had

06:31.047 --> 06:40.496
been to church every Sunday and very active in 
church youth activities, but I just didn't have

06:31.047 --> 06:40.496
room for that when I was at school. I know there was a 
Catholic student union. I think there was a

06:42.839 --> 06:46.582
Methodist, a Baptist student fellowship. But 
they were not real active and real big at that point

06:46.602 --> 06:51.867
in time. I know of no denomination nationally. 
We're Presbyterian. I know of no denomination

06:54.750 --> 06:57.032
nationally And I don't know any institution 
nationally that is doing religious activities

06:57.215 --> 07:05.105
for undergraduates well. Yeah, TCU doesn't. No, 
no, no. TCU, we have a real hard time with that. And

07:10.412 --> 07:14.537
we're right across the street from campus and have 
a formal affiliation, and we still don't do it

07:10.412 --> 07:14.537
well. I know, but there are probably more Baptist 
students at TCU than the same. Probably. I know at

07:17.661 --> 07:21.846
Austin College, Presbyterians are third in the 
number. Now, there were no international...

07:25.075 --> 07:31.979
events that stirred you and your, no Pearl 
Harbors, no D-days, nothing like this. Mm-mm,

07:32.782 --> 07:33.043
mm-mm. Nothing that caused you to lie awake at 
night? Well, it was Watergate, and it was Nixon's

07:37.083 --> 07:41.688
resignation.

07:44.912 --> 07:55.886
But we seemed so distant from that, because nobody 
had TVs in their rooms, and if you wanted to watch

07:44.912 --> 07:55.886
TV, you watched in one of the TV rooms down in the 
Commons. And they tended to be crowded, and they

07:56.427 --> 08:00.111
were dark, and... I didn't spend a lot of time in the 
TV rooms. We got our news from The Bat. What did

08:08.837 --> 08:09.778
y'all think of The Bat? The Bat, everybody read it, 
but we thought that they were a bunch of wild-eyed

08:09.798 --> 08:24.276
liberal media freaks, and they had long hair, and 
they were kind of the hippies on campus. They

08:24.610 --> 08:33.102
raised the GPA for transferring into journalism 
two weeks ago, they raised it to 2.2.

08:35.157 --> 08:50.805
But I remember that was the first time I ever used a 
word processor, was when I ran for vice president

08:35.157 --> 08:50.805
for student services the spring of my sophomore 
year, or rules and regulations, vice president

08:35.157 --> 08:50.805
for rules and regulations for student 
government. I got a vote of no confidence from the

08:50.825 --> 08:52.648
bat. I didn't have anybody running against me, but 
I got a vote of no confidence just because I... I'd

08:56.555 --> 09:00.402
been a secretary and stuff like that, and they 
really didn't know who I was. I remember how mad I

09:00.562 --> 09:01.904
was. There was a guy, Scott Sherman, I can't 
remember what his name was, who was a reporter for

09:02.666 --> 09:13.204
The Bat, but I also knew from student government, 
and I wanted to write a rebuttal. He says, we'll

09:13.264 --> 09:15.207
print that, sure. He says, really, it would be 
easiest if you just came down to wherever they

09:15.247 --> 09:22.039
wrote The Bat and and just go ahead and type it in 
yourself. And I typed a mile a minute. So I went and

09:26.043 --> 09:39.818
he taught me how to use a word processor to write my 
rebuttal, which they did print, and I won the

09:26.043 --> 09:39.818
election.

09:40.499 --> 09:44.984
Were you and your friends aware of any secret 
fraternities? No, not at all. You never heard of

09:46.986 --> 09:49.789
them? Mm-mm, mm-mm. official sororities and 
fraternities came to campus the year I was a

09:51.398 --> 09:58.266
freshman. What did y'all think of that idea? 
Horrible. We thought it was just a disgrace to the

10:00.869 --> 10:03.192
A&M tradition. And I can remember, because a bunch 
of my friends who had gone to other schools, TCU,

10:03.753 --> 10:17.189
were all Chi Omegas, and I remember I got a call from 
someone asking me if I would be one of the charter

10:03.753 --> 10:17.189
members of the Chi Omega chapter on campus. And I 
thought, well, why in the hell would I want to do

10:17.209 --> 10:20.072
something stupid like that? It really didn't want 
any part of it. And the men and the women that were in

10:22.896 --> 10:26.861
sororities and fraternities, there were very few 
of them. Invariably, they were big city, big high

10:27.401 --> 10:35.571
school, upper middle class kinds of kids, and they 
were pariahs. They really were. Did you know we now

10:38.675 --> 10:45.283
have a higher percentage per capita of fraternity 
and sorority members than UT does? Yes. Isn't that

10:48.041 --> 10:48.842
fascinating? Last year, three of the core Yale 
leaders, in other words, there were core members

10:48.862 --> 10:54.610
and Yale leaders, were in fraternities. Yeah. I 
remember telling somebody the other day that

10:55.030 --> 10:59.176
there were guys in the core in fraternities, and 
they just blew them away. I didn't realize any Yale

10:59.316 --> 11:03.121
leaders had been, but secret societies, no. 
Apparently, they still exist. TTs, True Texans,

11:06.225 --> 11:10.171
and then this one will stun you. It goes back to the 
teens. Sterling Evans was a member. The Stickers,

11:13.535 --> 11:17.160
full name Schwa Stickers. long before the Nazi 
Party discovered the Navajo and Hindu, I didn't

11:18.372 --> 11:32.387
know, both in India and in the United States for 
the, that was a good luck symbol. And it was a

11:32.407 --> 11:34.970
welcoming symbol. And apparently the purpose of 
both groups is very simple, to get their members

11:34.990 --> 11:44.160
elected to the key positions, used to be core 
commanders. Who were the most, what were the most

11:44.427 --> 11:49.553
respected student leadership positions? Corps 
commander, president of the student body. Which

11:52.217 --> 11:54.940
of those would have had the highest? Corps 
commander. Really? Okay. Yeah, even then. Yeah.

11:59.506 --> 12:04.031
What about MSC council chairman or president? Not 
nearly as high. Okay. Not nearly as high. What

12:07.235 --> 12:09.438
about band commander? Up there, but not at the top. 
Did you all respect the band? Oh, yes. You didn't

12:15.553 --> 12:16.775
make fun of them? Oh, sure we did. Oh, okay. Yeah, 
they were BQs. But it was a good nature? It was a good

12:20.540 --> 12:21.221
nature. We really admired them, but we loved to 
give them a hard time for being kind of nerdy. If a

12:26.649 --> 12:35.060
girl had a choice between a guy who was in the corps 
or not, was there any status difference? A little

12:35.080 --> 12:35.781
bit. You know, we... The women like us that were 
boot chasers got teased and made fun of, but

12:38.309 --> 12:51.009
there was some status to going out with, 
especially an upperclassman in the Corps. And did

12:52.431 --> 12:55.035
your co-eds use Aggie slang? like boot chasers. 
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Did you all adopt any of the food

12:58.940 --> 13:04.686
lingo from the dining hall? Some of it. Not the more 
descriptive terms, but... Did you ever at home get

13:06.027 --> 13:15.537
in trouble for slipping and using an Aggie slang 
term at home? I never got in trouble, but probably

13:15.617 --> 13:23.065
the first time I, you know, piss hit or court hurt or 
something like that, I... I was like, what did you

13:23.990 --> 13:26.212
just say? Because, you know, being TCU people, 
they really weren't familiar with any of that. And

13:29.115 --> 13:31.497
I kind of explained to them, that's what they're 
called. They were like, well, okay, we can live

13:31.537 --> 13:35.541
with that. It's getting close to 15 minutes. Yeah, 
a few more minutes. Yeah, let's keep talking. Oh,

13:39.805 --> 13:40.226
okay. And you don't remember ever hearing any real 
anti-female put-downs. Women were welcome. A

13:51.717 --> 13:52.157
few. You know, there were probably some 
upperclassmen perhaps in the Corps that were so

13:52.829 --> 14:13.571
diehard old army kind of guys that, but, you know, I 
think most of the men appreciated having some

13:52.829 --> 14:13.571
women on campus finally. Where did a, where did a 
co-ed turn for special advice? To her friends.

14:21.196 --> 14:22.798
Because there wasn't a dean of women. Were you 
acquainted with John Coldis? Yes. What did you all

14:26.684 --> 14:27.425
think of him? Oh, we adored him. We just worshipped 
the ground he walked on. One of the best there ever

14:29.728 --> 14:30.970
was. And he would, and I didn't realize it until he 
told me last weekend when I saw him at John David

14:31.491 --> 14:39.222
Crowe's retirement party. that he'd really only 
been there a year before I came. And, but he was the

14:43.221 --> 14:48.607
most nurturing, supportive man. We all just 
adored him. You know, and if you got the, he had

14:50.629 --> 14:55.174
these Tuesday night dinners in the MSC where he 
would have some student leaders come. If you got to

14:55.254 --> 15:02.562
do that, you were just, that was one of the most 
prestigious things on campus that you got to do. I

15:02.582 --> 15:09.529
was on the search committee and I was stunned that 
we were considering a guy from East Texas. No, he

15:10.032 --> 15:13.380
nationally. And then another one that nationally 
is among the best there ever was is Bob Walker.

15:18.332 --> 15:18.973
Yeah. See, Bob has turned down the same job at 
Michigan. Really? And at Berkeley. Those aren't

15:26.384 --> 15:27.705
good time ones. See, those are really, really 
tough. I remember Bob from when I was a freshman

15:31.710 --> 15:37.396
because he was very, you know, he was a wonderful 
mentor. They kind of adopted all the president's

15:37.777 --> 15:41.441
scholars because there really weren't that many 
of us back then. And I remember him from day one just

15:41.461 --> 15:45.526
being so supportive. But Coldus was just such a 
sweetheart. I remember when I was in medical

15:48.689 --> 15:51.092
school, coming back to take my national boards in 
between second and third year, I house sat for

15:51.511 --> 15:56.798
them. They let me stay in their house. They were out 
of town, and so I got to stay there when I took my

15:59.362 --> 16:02.646
boards. You know, just things like that that make 
so much difference in a student's life. See, as a

16:07.573 --> 16:09.476
sideline watcher, I worry. He and Ray Bowen are 
classmates. And with Ray retiring, I don't think

16:14.900 --> 16:17.604
Bob plans to ever retire. I hope not. Because he's 
so good. Well, I hope not. Gee, who is there? Jack

16:23.873 --> 16:24.974
Kenny Williams. Describe him as you students 
thought of him. Everybody

16:28.699 --> 16:32.365
liked him. He was popular. He always had that smile 
on his face. As women, we felt that he bridged the

16:39.166 --> 16:50.226
old A&M, new A&M thing well. And I personally felt 
like he walked that tightrope pretty well. I

16:58.300 --> 17:00.043
remember He was not... I don't remember being real 
close to students like Coldis or Stark or somebody

17:02.009 --> 17:08.755
like that, but everybody was very fond of him. He 
was a very popular president. But I do remember

17:11.598 --> 17:18.564
when we did Godspell that spring, we did it in the 
theater. We didn't do it in the auditorium. And he

17:20.545 --> 17:24.809
was there, front and center, for one of the first 
performances. And I remember there was one scene

17:25.129 --> 17:29.473
where... the kids go out in the audience and talk to 
the cast members during a song, and one of the more

17:29.453 --> 17:41.566
voluptuous women went and sat in his lap and sang to 
him, and he just got the biggest kick out of it. And I

17:41.706 --> 17:46.171
remember how delighted we all were that he was such 
a good sport about it. So many students nicknamed

17:46.931 --> 17:49.494
him Smiling Jack. Oh, yeah, Smiling Jack. And I 
know from these interviews that the board, then

17:51.897 --> 17:58.043
board of directors, they weren't regents yet, 
guess how they knew to go look for him? Because Earl

18:01.196 --> 18:06.643
Rutter told Ford All Britain and John Lindsay, 
they were flying Chicago in 1968. My source of this

18:07.103 --> 18:08.905
is Ford. And he said, I looked at Mr. Rutter and 
said, Earl, you really got A&M moving now. God help

18:14.953 --> 18:16.195
us if it were to happen. But if something happened 
to you, do you have somebody He said, Rudder put his

18:18.509 --> 18:21.720
glass down and said, no, I don't. And I learned in 
Europe that the CO may go down in battle. And I got to

18:25.815 --> 18:26.497
do that. Albritton said, we stopped it. Then that 
night at supper, brought it back up. And he said,

18:31.520 --> 18:34.848
Mr. Rutter said, I've been thinking about it since 
you asked me. If something were ever to happen to

18:35.229 --> 18:44.473
me, you go to the University of Tennessee system, 
get their number two man, name is Jack Kenny

18:35.229 --> 18:44.473
Williams, first commissioner of higher 
education in Texas, organize the coordinating

18:35.229 --> 18:44.473
board. But before he came to Texas, where he was 
highly regarded, He started off teaching

18:49.289 --> 19:06.498
southern history, as I did, at a separate land 
grant school in a southern state which was all

18:49.289 --> 19:06.498
male, compulsory military, racially 
segregated, had a corps of cadets, and they made

18:49.289 --> 19:06.498
the changes at Clemson so that he would understand 
A&M well. And he said then when Earl died, Ford

19:11.142 --> 19:12.544
said, I was a new board member. All I had to do was 
tell my colleagues, this is what. This is what he

19:15.509 --> 19:16.671
wanted, yeah. And so he said, we went and hired him 
on the spot. Wow. No presidential search, no

19:21.218 --> 19:27.389
search firm, no committee, no. Have you all 
selected a firm yet, a search firm? I don't know if

19:30.093 --> 19:33.677
the committee has selected a firm yet or not. Not 
that I've heard of. Bill Funk in Dallas is the best

19:34.518 --> 19:37.001
there is. Well, we worked with him with the 
chancellor search. I've known him for a little

19:39.945 --> 19:46.213
more than 15 years and he's good. Yeah, I was 
impressed when I spoke with him because they were

19:46.353 --> 19:53.602
in the middle of that when I first came on the board 
and Bill kind of helped me get up to speed with the

19:46.353 --> 19:53.602
chancellor search. Back to Williams, were you as a 
student aware of his heart attack? of his illness

19:59.489 --> 20:01.152
in 76? Yeah, yeah. It was downplayed, but 
everybody realized that something had happened.

20:08.803 --> 20:15.854
And see, the campus physician, whose name neither 
of us can remember for certain, is the one who saved

20:08.803 --> 20:15.854
his life at the house. So the helicopter could take 
him to Houston. And then DeBakey did some

20:19.760 --> 20:22.444
marvelous things. But when Williams died, I think 
he was 68. three or four, the oldest surviving male

20:26.708 --> 20:33.588
in the family tree history. All William's males 
die. Let's quit there. Okay. Let's quit there.
