WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:05.207
for, you know, include your name and age and 
something about what you do in this area. Well, I'm

00:06.048 --> 00:08.992
D.L. Peters, Doug Peters, and I've lived right 
around in, in four bars of here all my life. I'll be,

00:18.582 --> 00:25.149
let's see, I was born in 98, I'll be 70, 77 this next 
birthday. Won't I always? 77. And, uh, But I spent

00:29.090 --> 00:34.375
10 years in the crime academy working for my 
brother in the ranch over there. And we moved over

00:34.896 --> 00:45.966
there in 33 and moved back here in 43 and built this 
home here and got through it in 44 and been right

00:34.896 --> 00:45.966
here ever since. And that's our old home place 
right across the road there. And we moved down

00:51.332 --> 00:53.634
there when I was seven years old. And I'll never 
forget that. we moved up there one day and school

00:58.368 --> 01:26.873
had started you know and and I never had been to 
school and so when children them days all walked

00:58.368 --> 01:26.873
you know to school and there's two families lived 
on this way so when they came along when they told me

00:58.368 --> 01:26.873
to send me out there to go to school with them when we 
got on down the road down to Hunter when they they

00:58.368 --> 01:26.873
older kids you know got to tell me about what all 
they gonna do to me that day you know and they'll

00:58.368 --> 01:26.873
been to school I turned around and That'd take me on 
a scoot, but

01:27.477 --> 01:36.969
like I told you a while ago, I didn't go long enough. 
Who were the first people in your family to move to

01:38.591 --> 01:42.095
this area? Where did they come from? Do you have any 
idea? No, I just don't know much about my people

01:45.099 --> 01:48.162
now. As far as, you know, I was born and raised, like 
I said, right around here. Where did your dad come

01:52.948 --> 01:54.430
from? He was staying away. He was here. I see. Now 
you're involved in farming and some ranching too,

01:59.694 --> 02:03.440
aren't you? No farming, just ranching. Have you 
noticed a lot of changes in the ranching methods or

02:06.504 --> 02:12.373
techniques since you moved here? Since you can 
remember? Tell me something about how they've

02:13.514 --> 02:14.876
changed. Well, way back on, you know, you didn't. 
The only way you fed in the cattle most when I was a

02:19.756 --> 02:26.204
kid was to cut moss trees for them. That's how we 
feed them. Well, some people did feed cottonseed,

02:27.826 --> 02:34.855
you know, just whole cottonseed to the milk cows, 
something like that. But cattle on the range, the

02:35.336 --> 02:41.523
only feed they ever got is when you cut out a moss 
tree and they got the moss off of it. Of course, that

02:42.224 --> 02:44.347
changed up a lot, just a whole lot. We started out 
feeding cottonseed cake when we first started

02:48.882 --> 02:50.965
feeding cattle. And we'd feed them about three 
times a week and give them two or three pounds a

02:52.227 --> 03:00.860
piece, you know. But now we feed the blocks and 
mineral blocks, stuff like that, just put it out

03:00.880 --> 03:09.893
once a week. It's a whole lot easier that way. I 
guess just as good as the other two. Being involved

03:18.768 --> 03:22.771
in ranching, do you remember any particularly bad 
years for weather? You know, droughts, or floods,

03:22.791 --> 03:26.114
or tornadoes, or things like that you can recall? 
When were they? 1925 was one real bad drought. It

03:33.260 --> 03:36.703
just sure was that bad. We've had about three of 
them, but I can't remember what years there were

03:36.883 --> 03:41.507
now. Can you tell me some more about the 1925 and 
what you did and what really went on around here

03:41.527 --> 03:48.353
during that? Of course, I was a young fellow then, 
and we didn't have any of the water cleanouts. You

03:56.021 --> 03:57.062
know, we didn't have any water. Of course, didn't 
have any grass either much, but just, you got to

03:57.103 --> 04:01.248
have water. You sure got to have that with Kevin. 
And them days, it sounds funny to say that there's

04:03.491 --> 04:11.801
some country down on this Minnesota River them 
days that never had been fenced. It's just open

04:11.821 --> 04:14.965
country. We took them cattle down there to the 
river. Of course, there's water in the river down

04:18.047 --> 04:22.974
there, but our place, Wixon Creek, goes through 
here. And the water all dried up and we didn't have

04:23.755 --> 04:25.999
any water. We got a man, a well man out there, my 
daddy did, to drill a deep well, you know, and we was

04:26.059 --> 04:37.195
gonna try to hook a gasoline pump onto it and water 
them that way. And he came out there with a big

04:38.257 --> 04:43.264
outfit and left it strapped in old water. And we 
moved the cattle on down to the river then and just

04:43.733 --> 04:56.688
run them outside and fed them a little cotton seed 
cake and cut elm trees for them. They'd eat the

04:56.708 --> 05:03.316
leaves off of the elm trees and fed them a little 
cake. Of course, we had plenty of water down there.

05:04.818 --> 05:12.947
The river was in the hole, but it hadn't dried

05:04.818 --> 05:12.947
up. Of course, we used to run hogs outside, you 
know. That's pretty good business for a while,

05:21.409 --> 05:24.934
too. Well, let me change the subject just a little 
bit. Do you remember any real famous people ever

05:29.159 --> 05:32.703
coming to the Bryan College Station area? 
Politicians or ministers or whatever that were

05:34.746 --> 05:40.673
really well-known nationally that you can 
remember coming here? Well, I don't, Judge

05:41.345 --> 05:54.579
Barron, I was telling you about just a while ago, I 
feel like he's done as much for this county as any

05:41.345 --> 05:54.579
man I can think of. Tell me something about what you 
mean. Well, he's a Christian man, and he stands for

05:56.100 --> 06:04.609
the principles, you know, the right thing. And 
he's had a big influence in that way. I'm not

06:12.091 --> 06:14.255
familiar with the man. Just tell me something 
about him. I don't know anything about him. Well,

06:16.779 --> 06:20.945
he's a lawyer, and he was judge of this county for 
several years. When did he start being judge? Oh, I

06:22.488 --> 06:23.570
can't remember. Way back in the day. Way back in the 
day. But he's meant a lot to this county. He sure

06:31.062 --> 06:32.344
has, I think. We're looking at that picture up 
there on the wall that you showed me from 1910,

06:32.763 --> 06:37.748
downtown Bryan. Tell me something about the 
people in 1910 in Bryan. What did most of them do?

06:42.253 --> 06:43.494
What kept them around here? Was College Station 
here then? Oh yeah, College Station. Boy, I can

06:47.118 --> 06:49.621
remember. When was college... When was it 
organized and started over there? The

06:54.286 --> 06:55.006
university? It was in the 1860s? With the Hatch 
Act? I think that's right. It's been there ever

07:00.732 --> 07:02.314
since I was I don't remember, I know. Well, back 
them days, you know, you went everywhere

07:04.705 --> 07:11.393
horseback or in a buglet or wagon or something like 
that. You didn't, wasn't in an automobile. And on

07:13.495 --> 07:16.719
that, in that picture up there, there's one old car 
sitting there. Do you notice that? Yeah, I see it. I

07:18.922 --> 07:19.343
sure do. That's the only cars in the county, I 
reckon, in 1910. And I remember when they had a

07:25.671 --> 07:30.917
trolley car They used to run from Bryan to College 
and out there, what we call Midway now, you know

07:31.572 --> 07:38.920
where that is? Uh-huh, sure do. Martin's 
Barbecue's in Long Lake, that's Midway. And they

07:43.725 --> 07:59.503
had a big, built a big tank out there at Lake and made 
a swimming place, you know, where you'd go out

07:43.725 --> 07:59.503
there and go swimming and then they had rods of 
different kinds out there, kind of like a on the

07:59.720 --> 08:03.885
order of a carnival or something like that, you 
know, a pleasure deal. So that was a big deal. Them

08:05.927 --> 08:20.624
days, of course, the boys would come into the Brine 
to the picture show, the A&M boys, and they used to

08:05.927 --> 08:20.624
turn the Allen Academy boys and the A&M boys all 
loose on Saturday evenings, you know, and they

08:05.927 --> 08:20.624
could come in there, but they quit doing that. I 
heard that there's too many boys out there at one

08:27.985 --> 08:31.350
time, so Allen then went to turn it out on Monday. On 
Mondays, having a Monday holiday and a Saturday.

08:36.897 --> 08:38.700
But you did that for a good while.

08:42.525 --> 08:45.189
Tell me something about, remember the 
Depression? Oh, you bet. You were here then. Tell

08:47.251 --> 08:49.554
me what conditions were like during that time 
around here. That's my daughter up there, Miss

08:49.575 --> 08:51.357
Bell. What did you say his name was? Barfield, Carl 
Barfield. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too.

08:57.348 --> 08:58.790
tell you what now. Tell me something about the 
Depression. What went on around there? What did

09:02.374 --> 09:03.115
people do? How were people thinking about it 
during that time? Well, it is tough.

09:09.883 --> 09:17.512
But, of course, country people, you know, we, 
cattle got out to nothing. You couldn't get

09:17.532 --> 09:19.114
nothing for them. Farm products, you couldn't get 
nothing for that. But I guess in a way the country

09:23.926 --> 09:37.782
people fared better than the city people because 
we had gardens and had plenty of meat to eat you know

09:23.926 --> 09:37.782
and as far as uh we didn't have any money but we did 
have plenty to eat. But it wasn't a way for us to get

09:39.143 --> 09:42.667
over the money them did. What did most people 
around here do at that time during the depression?

09:46.732 --> 09:49.274
They farmed and ranched. When I was a kid this whole 
community was in farming. What kind of crops?

09:55.488 --> 09:57.010
Cotton and corn. That was the main crop. Cotton was 
the money crop. Of course, the corn, they had to

10:00.314 --> 10:05.742
have that to feed the stock on, you know. You know, I 
work with insects. It's my profession. I'd be

10:09.667 --> 10:13.132
interested in knowing if you remember the first 
boll weevil that was reported in this area. No, I

10:13.672 --> 10:15.034
can't remember that. Do you remember any 
particularly bad years for insects? You finally

10:19.732 --> 10:22.676
caught it, didn't you? No, I don't remember what 
particular year it was, but I do remember when I was

10:22.876 --> 10:34.992
just a kid, I didn't hear anything about it, but I 
don't remember when it started. They were mostly

10:35.353 --> 10:38.537
down in the Brazilians. Yeah, it started more so 
down in there, because that was a cotton country

10:38.617 --> 10:43.944
more than so it is. And the Depression, didn't we 
live over in Barnes County then? Oh, we live down

10:49.111 --> 10:51.534
here. Well, here's two pictures up here. I don't 
guess they do you any good.

11:00.303 --> 11:10.734
Do you remember any particularly big events, like 
political meetings or community picnics or

11:00.303 --> 11:10.734
anything of that sort that took place around here 
that really attracted a lot of people and were

11:00.303 --> 11:10.734
really big things? The Hoods Brigade. We had Hoods 
Brigade. All the men and boys had to let their

11:19.098 --> 11:26.105
Beards grow out and all, and the women wore 
colonial dresses, and bonnets, you know. That was

11:27.326 --> 11:28.507
the hoods we gave. Yeah, but I can't remember much 
about it. Things way back yonder, I can remember a

11:32.591 --> 11:41.079
lot cleaner than I can, but just a lot of things that 
happen now, I can't remember nothing about it in a

11:32.591 --> 11:41.079
year or two. Well, how far back there are you 
talking about remembering? Well, like that 1910

11:45.220 --> 11:47.502
now. What do you remember? When you see that 
picture, what do you think of? I just think of one

11:50.485 --> 11:57.433
thing that I used to really enjoy. Those bottom 
farmers was all down in the brown part of them, you

11:57.453 --> 12:03.899
know, down Jones Bridge Road and all that part of 
the country. They brought all their cotton and

12:03.939 --> 12:06.362
everything to Brown. Of course, they had gin down 
there, but then they'd haul it. Brown had it

12:10.666 --> 12:14.130
compressed, you know, and stored here. And they 
hauled all their groceries, all their supplies

12:14.887 --> 12:21.153
from here back down there. And big farmers had 
commissaries.

12:26.919 --> 12:39.591
But the thing I can tell you is that those teams, 
they were big bottom farmers that had six and maybe

12:26.919 --> 12:39.591
some of them, a few of them, eight mules to one 
wagon. And they colored people in. They could

12:43.827 --> 12:45.448
really handle them mules. You know how wide Street 
Brown is. They'd put one line on that mule and

12:49.312 --> 12:55.157
they'd be riding one to the wheel wagging you. And 
they'd put one line on the lead mule and they could

12:55.758 --> 13:05.907
just swing that wagon around there and back it up to 
the porch there and load it. And I got a lot of kick

13:06.528 --> 13:08.629
out of it. I'm just watching them. That's one of the 
One thing that I can remember more so than nearly

13:12.059 --> 13:18.428
anything, and I've seen steers on the street. 
There's an old boy up north of Brown. He used to

13:21.232 --> 13:24.116
drive steers a lot. I've seen him a lot of times. I 
just enjoyed them. And they'd have little bells on

13:27.440 --> 13:30.905
the mules, on the lead mule. Yeah. And a torso, red 
torso. It looked good to me. I got a lot of kick out of

13:35.191 --> 13:38.556
just watching that. Do you remember anything, 
anyone ever telling you about slavery in this

13:40.443 --> 13:47.873
area, about owning slaves or anything of that 
nature in the Bryan College Station area? No, I

13:50.055 --> 13:52.358
don't believe I can. This piece of land that you 
live on right here, who lived here before you did?

13:56.304 --> 13:59.187
Do you know anything about these people? Well, 
this particular spot, I don't believe anybody

14:00.449 --> 14:09.741
ever lived right on it, but we got some men right out 
there that were colored from it. But there's a,

14:09.923 --> 14:15.950
there's a white fellow that owned the head of him, 
but I can't, he was a doctor. I mean, doctor, but he,

14:16.030 --> 14:23.198
you know, he's, well, I, I think he'd served the 
term in the pen. And he got out in the wheelchair. He

14:27.543 --> 14:32.509
had a son, and he and his wife and son, but he never 
did practice medicine here. But he lived right out

14:33.230 --> 14:34.571
there. But after that, though, after he didn't 
stay there, Seemed like a year or two, I can't

14:40.248 --> 14:43.052
remember. But there's an old colored fella bought 
it. He and his wife lived there, didn't have any

14:44.894 --> 14:48.779
children. And that's all. But now this, there was a 
house right down yonder where that one was then,

14:51.062 --> 14:59.613
and this land, this old colored fella had three 
acres out there. And the 17 acres belonged to a man

14:59.633 --> 15:07.082
by the name of Freeman that lived down there then, 
and that's as far back as I can remember. anybody.

15:08.391 --> 15:11.056
He's living there as far as I can remember. But. You 
know my grandfather used to tell me of back in the

15:13.520 --> 15:24.660
late 1890s early 1900s of actually seeing some of 
the old west saloon the saloons and the the

15:13.520 --> 15:24.660
gunfights actually. He saw one or two of those he 
would relate. Did you ever witness anything like

15:26.222 --> 15:27.605
this? No of course I had saloons then they don't 
ever They were cornered, Brian, in 1910. Tell me,

15:35.020 --> 15:36.682
you remember anything about them? I mean, at all? 
No, I don't. I never did. There's a fellow who run a

15:42.150 --> 15:47.097
hamburger joint in one of them, and he stood right 
in it. I mean, he had to stand right in the front

15:47.398 --> 15:49.621
door. And kids, they wasn't allowed to go in the 
flume, but we could go up to that front door and get

15:50.843 --> 16:01.538
hamburgers and things like that. But I can't never 
remember maybe but once or twice ever going in a

16:02.530 --> 16:09.421
saloon back in them days. Of course, now when you go 
to eat, you go in a beer jar. You know, they usually

16:13.688 --> 16:16.993
had a beer or something like that. But I've never 
seen any fights like that or any trouble like that.

16:23.684 --> 16:29.533
If you had to pick out one or two things at their 
events or whatever that have happened in this

16:23.684 --> 16:29.533
area, in your lifetime that really stand out or 
that have impressed you, what would you talk

16:29.885 --> 16:34.673
about? I can't even remember. Just take a second 
and think about something. I'm sure you must have

16:41.824 --> 16:44.789
experienced a tremendous amount since you've 
been here. Well,

16:45.850 --> 16:56.888
there's one thing that just comes to my mind, I 
don't know whether, but anyhow, Well, back yonder

16:57.475 --> 17:05.484
we used to drive cattle from, buy cattle over 
yonder at Riverside, the other side of

16:57.475 --> 17:05.484
Huntsville, you know where that is? And we'd drive 
them, drive them there over here. And then from

17:08.928 --> 17:18.539
here over to Caldwell, we, that's when I was a young 
fella, and we bought cattle over there, and we'd

17:08.928 --> 17:18.539
bought and sell and sold. And we'd go over there and 
buy a bunch of cattle and drive them here, or to

17:19.440 --> 17:26.368
Welborn over here, and my friend and I, we was in 
together. And I never will forget one time we

17:31.157 --> 17:46.435
brought a bunch of cattle from over there and we 
came through Pinewood from the other side of,

17:31.157 --> 17:46.435
going to Huntsville over there. What's the name of 
that place this side of Huntsville? Shire Oak, and

17:51.321 --> 17:56.507
then they, well, we came through Pinewood there, 
just open country, you know, Pinewood, They had a

17:56.977 --> 17:59.160
railroad them days going through Carlisle. You 
know where Carlisle is? No, I don't. It's the old

18:02.504 --> 18:07.169
Carlisle Drive County on 30 going to Boyd's 
Huntsman. And one time we had a bunch of cattle. We

18:10.353 --> 18:14.438
were just about to the railroad track, and a train 
was coming. And an engineer, I reckon, thought

18:14.498 --> 18:19.865
he'd give us a little scare. And he went to blowing 
the whistle, and them cattle just, man, they broke

18:20.786 --> 18:26.072
out. And there's a home that's built like this is a 
fence going down the railroad right-of-way. The

18:32.956 --> 18:34.698
right-of-way was here. Well, there's a home right 
against this fence with a porch sticking out over

18:35.258 --> 18:43.187
in there right-of-way like. You know, like this is 
a house with a porch that stands out here. And

18:47.633 --> 18:55.722
there's two children swinging out on the porch in 
one of these swings that swing up from the ceiling

18:47.633 --> 18:55.722
down. And a cow run across that porch and slipped 
and knocked them two kids out of that swing, and

18:56.984 --> 19:08.836
they went crawling in the house. But I think about 
that every once in a while, about how dangerous it

19:08.856 --> 19:13.621
was. But we finally got them all together. But 
that's about it. Just thinking back to it. You

19:22.130 --> 19:23.171
mentioned the railroad. What do you remember 
about the railroad in relationship to Bryan

19:23.252 --> 19:26.535
College Station? But of course the railroad's 
been here ever since I can remember. There used to

19:33.965 --> 19:50.363
be a, of course we, you know in them days you didn't, 
my grandfather lived in Bryan, and I'd get to go out

19:33.965 --> 19:50.363
there and spend the night with him once in a while, 
and the first picture show I ever saw, Was that

19:50.748 --> 19:55.437
right across from the old Dixie Theater, what do 
you call that? You remember when that was? No, no,

19:57.901 --> 19:59.584
it must have been... I'm 77 years old, must have 
been... I imagine I was maybe 12, 14 years old,

20:05.896 --> 20:09.623
something like that. You were born in 1898? Yeah, 
yeah. I imagine I do not know. Tell me something

20:17.039 --> 20:20.967
about the women of these times when you were 
growing up. Perhaps your mother or what did they

20:21.007 --> 20:24.294
do? Were they just mostly around the house or what 
was really their role? Well, yeah, most of the

20:29.445 --> 20:38.423
women that I was associated with, their role was 
just housekeeping and kind of looking after the

20:29.445 --> 20:38.423
family, you know. That's most of it. Well, can you 
tell me something about your immediate family, or

20:42.021 --> 20:47.809
how many brothers and sisters, and what they all 
did, or what? Well, I had got two brothers and a

20:48.169 --> 20:59.365
sister living there, and one brother died when he 
was around 21 years old. But we was all raised right

20:59.385 --> 21:02.670
here, every one of them. Well done. And two 
brothers lived, one brother lived right over

21:04.252 --> 21:08.798
here. in this big house, and the other one lived in 
Brown. Sister lived in Austin, and that's as far as

21:12.859 --> 21:18.266
we ever got away from here to live. You know, your 
wife, or you mentioned earlier that you go to

21:20.629 --> 21:26.617
church quite often. Apparently you're a 
religious man. Can you tell me something about the

21:29.080 --> 21:38.852
churches in this area and how they got started, or 
what the story was with what kind of religions, or

21:29.080 --> 21:38.852
where are you, and how long have you been, and that 
sort of thing? Well, the church is, our church is

21:39.271 --> 21:46.720
right up here on this 30, you know where you turn? 
Well, that's our church, and it was moved from

21:46.740 --> 22:07.624
down, it's Bethel Church now, but it's moving down 
the road there, it's off of the road, the highway,

21:46.740 --> 22:07.624
and we live back down towards,

21:46.740 --> 22:07.624
we went to Steve Haller Church until then. I was 
seven years old and then, as I told you a while ago,

22:08.448 --> 22:12.693
we moved up here. And they had a vote going, you 
know, they're trying to move the church up where it

22:13.674 --> 22:22.905
is now, and some of them was in favor of it and some of 
them were not. And so my dad and mother never did

22:24.207 --> 22:32.437
take part until after they got it settled, when 
they voted to move it up here. Well, they joined

22:32.457 --> 22:36.902
this church up here after they got that settled. 
and so it's that's i remember when they built it up

22:37.625 --> 23:04.948
here but the old church i remember it too down there 
but i i remember going there some but that's about i

22:37.625 --> 23:04.948
don't know when it was built the old one i believe i 
believe i was just a hundred and that seemed like

22:37.625 --> 23:04.948
they said about 107 years old that's what i heard 
because we didn't have a anniversary on the 100th,

23:05.603 --> 23:12.912
and the preacher said something about, well, we 
could have a, have it, you know, for 107 years. I

23:12.932 --> 23:15.195
believe that's about what it's been like. Not, not 
in this place, but I mean, since it's organized. Do

23:18.740 --> 23:24.287
you remember anything about church when you were 
young, and the difference in, in the type services

23:18.740 --> 23:24.287
now and then? Well, uh,

23:26.490 --> 23:35.121
church, when I was young, uh, I know young people 
didn't have anything to say in the church in them

23:36.670 --> 23:43.200
days. And the ladies didn't need us for that 
matter. It was run by the men way back then. And I

23:52.234 --> 23:57.242
remember they had what they called in them days, 
Amen Corners. A bunch of men, you know, maybe

23:58.304 --> 24:03.792
deacons and men that was active in the church maybe 
four or five benches in the corner over here, and

24:04.362 --> 24:09.669
people called that Amen Corners. When preachers 
got preaching pretty hard, preaching the truth,

24:11.271 --> 24:16.418
well, they'd amen him, you know. You don't hear 
much of that no more. You ever sit in an Amen corner?

24:21.345 --> 24:21.625
No. No, I don't. That is kind of, when I got up, kind 
of out of date, like.

24:31.238 --> 24:34.302
You know, a big part of any community are the the 
people that are in the politics of the community,

24:35.176 --> 24:43.724
the mayors, the judges, you've already mentioned 
one, the city councils, councilmen, that sort of

24:35.176 --> 24:43.724
thing. Do you remember any particularly 
important people having held positions in Bryan

24:44.644 --> 24:52.151
College Station outside this judge you mentioned 
a moment ago? If so, tell me something about them

24:53.752 --> 24:55.654
that you remember. I'm sure there's been a lot of 
them, but I, you know, we lived out here and we

24:55.674 --> 25:04.542
didn't, we don't even get to vote on that city 
officers out there and things like that. I don't

25:08.269 --> 25:08.710
know. I just never did get interested. Like I said, 
we just didn't have any say coming out there about

25:11.933 --> 25:17.980
the mayor and things like that. Do you remember any 
scandals, any crimes that were found out? There's

25:23.126 --> 25:24.908
Watergate on the national scale. Did Bryan 
College Station ever have anything that way that

25:24.928 --> 25:28.572
you can remember? No, I can't remember. I just 
don't remember any crimes.

25:36.517 --> 25:43.950
What

25:36.517 --> 25:43.950
kind of games did you play when you were a kid? I'm 
sure they must differ from the games kids play

25:44.611 --> 25:47.836
today. Well, when we were youngsters, they had 
play parties. When school was out for the holidays

25:56.972 --> 26:01.900
during Christmas, Every night, you know, they'd 
usually wait until it turned out, oh, you'd have a

26:02.504 --> 26:09.171
week or ten days, holidays, Christmas. But every, 
uh, for every night during that time, except

26:10.452 --> 26:18.220
Sunday night, they'd have a, have a party. 
Different people, you know, they'd like to have a

26:18.300 --> 26:24.105
party here tonight and down yard tomorrow night 
and somewhere else. But they'd have one sort of

26:24.526 --> 26:28.229
lined out for every night. And, uh, The game they 
played them, it sure would look silly. Tell me

26:35.133 --> 26:35.834
about it. Tell me about it, really. You'd take an 
old boy and they'd play what you call a snap. You

26:40.961 --> 26:49.653
know, a boy and girl would hold hands and say a girl 
would snap somebody. Well, you'd run around and

26:49.673 --> 26:54.300
around that couple that's holding hands until you 
could tag him. And then he'd hold up with her. And

26:58.165 --> 27:00.068
then they'd... tag, I mean, ask somebody to come 
catch them. Now that don't make sense, but we've

27:08.827 --> 27:12.911
done that a million times. And they had the,

27:12.931 --> 27:24.544
we had one game that they pulled, I don't think I've 
ever seen them pull that but once. But they have two

27:25.745 --> 27:29.329
chairs like sitting together right here, three 
chairs. and they'd put a quilt over all three of

27:30.136 --> 27:32.480
them. Not that they had two chairs, but it'd be 
fixed like there's three and the middle would be

27:32.500 --> 27:40.391
vacant. And there'd be two girls maybe sitting 
here and this one and that one over there and they'd

27:40.411 --> 27:55.174
bring an old boy in, have him blindfolded, you 
know, call him in and lead him up there and take the

27:40.411 --> 27:55.174
blindfold. Well, no, they didn't have him 
blindfolded. They'd just bring him in there and

27:57.317 --> 27:59.400
they'd tell him, Sit down there between them two 
girls and have a tub of water under there. When he'd

28:04.236 --> 28:07.261
sit down, when the girls start to sit down, the 
girls jump up. Put right down the tub of water, he'd

28:07.281 --> 28:19.543
go. The continuation of this tape is on the flip 
side.
