WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:13.264
Let's see.

00:17.260 --> 00:30.708
Yeah, that in that area, and we need to make a big investment in that in terms of time and other resources, and we need to make sure that we really have a good focus about where we want to head.

00:30.988 --> 00:32.511
Is anyone doing that yet?

00:32.832 --> 00:36.720
Oh yeah, I think increasingly, but it's happening so quickly.

00:37.088 --> 00:47.547
What has been the real key, as far as I'm concerned, is that some of the real leading business programs are making a big commitment in this area.

00:47.567 --> 00:51.634
And when that happens, you better make sure you understand what's going on.

00:53.718 --> 00:56.363
Berkeley, Stanford.

00:56.343 --> 00:57.845
Virginia.

00:58.926 --> 01:10.059
And, you know, so, now nobody's figure, and Duke, Duke is a big player with their executive NBA or the international executive NBA.

01:10.079 --> 01:16.866
Nobody's really figured out yet exactly how they want to do it.

01:17.967 --> 01:22.873
But it's clear that we need to be in there in the game.

01:24.355 --> 01:40.956
And so that would be the single area, and then I would say to make sure that you really keep the ear to the ground to identify these emerging hot areas like Management Information System was 15 years ago.

01:41.556 --> 01:54.092
I think the whole area, and we're really ahead of the game in this, like the trading with the Reliant gift and some other gifts that we're getting in that area, that

01:54.747 --> 02:11.068
So many companies now are viewing ability to exchange and some kind of mechanism is critical to their future and they want people trained in that area.

02:11.449 --> 02:23.725
And, you know, it used to be the utility companies, for example, that if you talked about going with a company that was really tried and true and that you'd go to work every day and it looked the same as it did the day before,

02:24.177 --> 02:26.120
Nothing could be further from the truth today.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.887
I mean, those companies don't even know for sure from day to day what business they're in.

02:29.907 --> 02:32.070
And I mean, they have trading areas.

02:32.170 --> 02:39.923
If you've ever toured one of them and some of these companies like Enron or Reliant and so forth, they'll just dazzle you.

02:39.944 --> 02:49.780
And it drives home that we better stay on top as an educational institution of what's going on out in the marketplace.

02:51.920 --> 02:57.701
Curriculum, are there any changes in the curriculum that you think might be considered?

02:58.364 --> 03:02.318
Well, I think we'll continue to see technology folded in.

03:02.551 --> 03:07.197
You know, it will be just an everyday part of what we're doing.

03:07.398 --> 03:14.567
We can't turn out an accounting major today that if they don't have good systems capabilities, they're not going to make it.

03:15.088 --> 03:17.471
And I think increasingly we're going to see that.

03:17.572 --> 03:24.821
Increasingly we're going to see in the disciplines a recognition of the role that companies have.

03:25.362 --> 03:29.588
In marketing, for example, we're developing an e-commerce track.

03:29.568 --> 03:32.772
and also at the MBA level.

03:33.593 --> 03:36.857
So I think we'll continue to see that.

03:36.937 --> 03:45.367
The globalization, everybody that is doing that now, we recognize that those boundaries are gone.

03:45.887 --> 03:55.879
I think the next decade will be one of technology and information and how you use those and how you apply them in a business setting.

03:57.766 --> 04:01.832
What about the quality of life for you and your family during these years?

04:02.272 --> 04:17.553
Oh, you know, I think one of the attractions of anyone living here is the quality of life, and I would advise everyone to live in Houston for a number of years before they move here to really appreciate what a difference it is.

04:17.613 --> 04:23.301
And Houston's a fine city, but certainly

04:23.821 --> 04:37.133
You know, we keep a lot of faculty that can make a lot more money somewhere else, particularly ones that have young families because they fully value and appreciate what a community this is.

04:37.954 --> 04:43.419
And yet we're close enough to Houston that if there are things that you really feel like you need in a big city.

04:43.459 --> 04:51.786
So, I mean, I can't say enough about the community and how much we've enjoyed living here.

04:54.112 --> 05:00.258
All right, I've only got about four very general questions left.

05:00.861 --> 05:04.054
Have we left out anything important?

05:05.182 --> 05:17.722
No, you know, in thinking back over things, you know, I think one of the nice things about my 13 years here is there have been relatively few blips in the road.

05:17.822 --> 05:30.261
It's been a fairly linear progression in terms of the advancement of the college, and certainly there have been milestones like the building and new programs and so forth.

05:30.663 --> 05:56.721
You know, I view very positively that it's been fairly constant, fairly consistent, and that we haven't had major upheavals in the process, that there have been times we've sort of detoured and so forth, but for the most part, it's been steady, and it's been in a work environment that I think

05:57.190 --> 06:01.175
our faculty and staff would describe as very, very positive.

06:01.195 --> 06:09.487
Like in Southern Association and in the business accreditation, there have been no problems, have there?

06:09.507 --> 06:09.747
No.

06:10.769 --> 06:17.958
Now, we're concerned about the next round of business accreditation because it's a success or anything.

06:18.018 --> 06:21.703
Now, a school that's as good as A&M is not going to lose their accreditation.

06:21.784 --> 06:25.088
What could happen, though, is they could defer it or require us to

06:25.591 --> 06:28.227
provide a plan to show how we're addressing it,

06:28.747 --> 06:41.866
And there'll be no question of quality, but one of the criteria of ability to sustain long-term quality is the relationship of resources and student demand.

06:43.008 --> 06:56.728
And one of the reasons we had to put in the enrollment management and the university provided additional resources is that we had far exceeded the normal bounds expected for a top quality research program.

07:00.151 --> 07:04.680
What has it meant to you to have been at A&M these 13 years?

07:09.129 --> 07:12.796
Yeah, most days, you know, you don't even think about questions like that.

07:12.836 --> 07:22.615
But in looking back at it, you know, for me personally, on a non-career standpoint,

07:23.405 --> 07:41.251
One of the best decisions I ever made because I think the relationship even with my children was impacted with it because, you know, suddenly I was able, without it being a major hassle, to go to my son and daughter's athletic events as they finished up school.

07:42.553 --> 07:52.247
To be at a school that both my wife and I and my children felt good about going to that university.

07:52.430 --> 07:58.380
You know, I was delighted when they selected, because I thought that they could get a wonderful education here, and they did.

07:59.482 --> 08:10.580
So, you know, from a personal standpoint, and the fact that you do have more time that you can spend pursuing activities and with your family, it's just been great.

08:10.600 --> 08:16.750
From a professional standpoint, it's been really

08:18.451 --> 08:33.085
a delight and a professional satisfaction to be somewhere that had enormous potential and has been in the process of realizing some of that potential.

08:33.325 --> 08:36.608
We're not where we need to be and we're not where I hope we will be.

08:37.549 --> 08:46.197
And we've gotten detoured along the way with some problems that maybe we shouldn't and lost some focus.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.669
Great place.

08:49.811 --> 08:53.455
Did you come close to leaving during the 13 years?

08:53.595 --> 09:04.488
I would say that the only time that I really, really came close to leaving was in the early 90s.

09:04.588 --> 09:09.214
I was offered the position of president at the University of Texas at Arlington.

09:10.696 --> 09:20.335
You were going to succeed another Aggie?

09:21.395 --> 09:23.378
Let's see, who would that have been?

09:23.799 --> 09:25.381
That was there for so long?

09:25.401 --> 09:27.424
Yeah, I didn't realize he was an Aggie.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.588
He was on the faculty here.

09:30.089 --> 09:30.549
Oh, okay.

09:30.569 --> 09:48.718
And went up there when they became a senior college, because he was my favorite colleague in the UT System, and he said he went into Fred Benson, then the dean, and said, they've offered me the job to go up there and to organize the junior and senior years

09:48.698 --> 09:52.261
And at engineering, what do you think?

09:52.401 --> 09:56.345
And he said Benson told him, if you stay here, you've got a splendid future.

09:57.146 --> 10:02.230
If you go up there, there's no telling what you can, who knows what will happen with the growth of that area.

10:03.431 --> 10:06.274
And he was there present 19 years, six months.

10:06.614 --> 10:10.077
And did a, if Marilyn and I could tell this, a magnificent job.

10:10.177 --> 10:15.762
And I always thought, why in the world didn't they make it another six months to say two decades, two years?

10:16.563 --> 10:16.663
Yeah.

10:16.643 --> 10:31.882
It was a tough decision and it really boiled down to the fact that I just personally find more satisfaction in a flagship kind of university.

10:32.823 --> 10:38.230
And really there were some things were going well here and also

10:38.581 --> 10:40.224
I like the people here.

10:40.905 --> 10:56.990
And, you know, it sounds cliché and so forth, but these are really good colleagues here that if I decided at any day just to walk back and be on the faculty, I'd be delighted with the people that are here.

10:57.010 --> 10:57.991
They're my friends.

10:58.111 --> 11:00.635
I appreciate what they're doing.

11:00.775 --> 11:06.985
I just decided that this is where I was better off.

11:06.965 --> 11:09.188
All right, three questions left.

11:10.851 --> 11:15.398
What advice would you give key decision makers about the future of Texas A&M?

11:17.100 --> 11:20.886
Well, this is maybe somewhat self-serving.

11:20.926 --> 11:23.450
It probably is, but why should I change now?

11:23.530 --> 11:35.368
But I would say let's really think about what vision 2020 means and what are universities going to look like in 2020.

11:36.040 --> 12:05.001
I'm afraid that we have targeted what universities look like in 1990 and it's a moving target and I think they've already changed and also I'm not sure in today's environment that we can be all things to all people and I just hope that we'll spend a lot of time thinking about that and not become pretty good at everything because I don't think

12:05.605 --> 12:07.903
that will serve us best in the long run.

12:10.094 --> 12:19.829
Having been the chancellor of one of the six most comprehensive institutions in North America, I know how difficult that was at budget time.

12:19.849 --> 12:20.871
You just can't do it well.

12:20.891 --> 12:22.573
That's right.

12:22.593 --> 12:23.655
All right, next to last.

12:24.356 --> 12:30.525
Someone walks up to you and gives you a check for a million dollars, and it has only one requirement.

12:31.246 --> 12:37.596
You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you decide what use would be made of it.

12:37.616 --> 12:38.177
What would you...

12:39.727 --> 12:42.692
what would you do, have A&M do with that gift?

12:43.793 --> 12:48.160
Well, as Dean of the Business School, I mean, obviously I would focus it if it was my call.

12:48.481 --> 12:49.522
It is, yeah.

12:49.763 --> 13:02.022
I would, and that doesn't mean that if I was sitting in the provost position that I would, that that's what I would do with it, but obviously I'm not in a position to judge some of the other things, but

13:02.440 --> 13:23.841
You know, I think at this point in time I would invest that in probably graduate scholarships to help us be as competitive as possible in attracting the very best graduate students.

13:24.378 --> 13:31.789
I think we're getting the very best undergraduate students that state schools anywhere are getting.

13:32.630 --> 13:36.797
And we've got some terrific scholarship programs in this college.

13:36.837 --> 13:41.263
The Mitty Foundation gave us a gift that does great scholarships.

13:41.964 --> 13:46.692
But that's an area that I think that has got to be a priority for us.

13:48.254 --> 13:48.955
Last question.

13:49.716 --> 13:53.001
What feelings are in your heart for A&M now?

13:53.825 --> 13:57.670
You know, really very positive.

13:59.833 --> 14:09.044
I feel like I've made a pretty strong commitment to the place, and I think it's been a good investment on my part.

14:09.745 --> 14:12.148
I've been very fairly treated here.

14:14.752 --> 14:16.714
Nothing but very positive things.

14:16.794 --> 14:18.717
I certainly don't agree with all the decisions.

14:18.737 --> 14:23.022
I don't agree with all the decisions I've made, for heaven's sakes, you know.

14:23.002 --> 14:27.336
But really a very, very positive feeling.

14:27.377 --> 14:32.353
I'm glad that I came here, and I'm glad that I stayed here, and I'm glad that I'm remaining here.
