WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:26.961
the

00:01.398 --> 00:26.961
Americans

00:01.398 --> 00:26.961
came to the point where they were acting like, hey, 
I may disagree with you about whether or not we

00:01.398 --> 00:26.961
ought to be here in this war at all or not, but I can't 
find any excuse at all for torturing American

00:01.398 --> 00:26.961
prisoners. And the, oh, The North Vietnamese 
found out about this change in attitude in a number

00:31.503 --> 00:35.808
of different ways. When they did, that meant that 
they had one of two choices with regard to us, and

00:37.410 --> 00:54.472
that was either unite America against them or back 
off on their efforts to exploit us and try to get out

00:37.410 --> 00:54.472
of us what they want.

00:57.776 --> 00:59.518
They backed off somewhat. They didn't stop 
completely, and there were a lot of people who got

01:00.140 --> 01:09.632
hurt very badly after that period, but it was a 
whole lot better than it had been before. For

01:09.652 --> 01:12.055
example, take the food, for example. Before that, 
what was your staple, the usual type of meal, if you

01:13.136 --> 01:19.444
will? Okay.

01:23.389 --> 01:27.294
Generally, it consisted of either bread or rice. 
Earlier in the war, It was mostly bread. Later on,

01:30.640 --> 01:35.127
it was mostly rice, leading up to the change point 
that I'm talking about. That was our staple. And

01:38.852 --> 01:40.355
then we'd have a side dish. We called it sewer weed. 
You'd see it growing along the side of the sewer

01:43.680 --> 01:46.304
ditches. I watched guards out the slats on this 
first cell that I described that had the shutters

01:46.404 --> 01:52.353
on it. I could see down out of the shutters, and 
there was a little sewer ditch. It smelled like a

01:55.518 --> 01:57.200
sewer ditch. They walked along, picked a herd. 
lunch right there, boiling. Appetizing. It was

02:02.246 --> 02:04.468
just different kinds of greens. That was what the 
majority of it was. After the change point, we

02:09.694 --> 02:27.353
began to get some protein,

02:09.694 --> 02:27.353
some reconstituted milk, some canned meat, some 
canned beans, things like that with Russian

02:09.694 --> 02:27.353
labels on them. more in the last year or the last six 
months than earlier on, but after the change point

02:29.206 --> 02:44.721
in the late 60s, we began to see some of those things 
appear when they hadn't before to any substantial

02:29.206 --> 02:44.721
degree. What about the physical treatment of the 
soldiers? More threats and less torture. Before

02:53.090 --> 02:58.555
the change point, they come in, yank somebody out 
of the cell, and just start torturing them to get a

03:00.323 --> 03:05.871
war crimes confession or whatever.

03:07.714 --> 03:19.350
And having

03:07.714 --> 03:19.350
the kind of open communications for the classes 
that we talked about later on would have been

03:07.714 --> 03:19.350
unthinkable before that time. Afterwards, you 
know, if we were having a meeting, there was a class

03:19.370 --> 03:28.423
going on, they'd come in, they'd point their 
weapons at us, they'd load their weapons, And

03:28.640 --> 03:32.564
they'd rant and rail and threat, threaten a lot. 
And they might even take one guy out, but they

03:32.965 --> 03:39.372
wouldn't hurt him very badly. More of a scare 
tactic. Yeah, trying to. And when we found out that

03:42.275 --> 03:50.404
things were changing, we adapted accordingly. 
Well, that's another thing I wanted to bring up was

03:50.424 --> 03:58.393
what kind of, how did you figure out what was the 
actual true you know, news and world events versus

03:58.762 --> 04:01.586
the propaganda. I'm sure I've heard that they had 
the radio playing a lot and you would hear, you

04:01.626 --> 04:13.323
know, about the terrible things that were going on 
in America and the protesters and that nobody was

04:01.626 --> 04:13.323
behind you and that kind of a thing. How did you 
distinguish between the correct, valid news and

04:13.383 --> 04:19.872
what they wanted you to think was going on? We did a 
terrible, terrible thing, Barbara. And one of the

04:25.681 --> 04:27.283
interrogators... observe what was going on and 
really let one of our guys have it. And he accused us

04:34.243 --> 04:37.187
of listening with our minds. And the implication 
was that's the lowest thing you could do. Even in

04:47.141 --> 04:50.806
this kind of war, that's not fair to them. In their 
context, that would be unthinkable. What you hear

04:56.626 --> 05:02.273
the party say is the answer you give back when 
asked. When we hear what the party said, then

05:04.136 --> 05:15.851
when we got pressed to the point where we had to say 
something, because the pain got so great, we'd

05:04.136 --> 05:15.851
tell them what really happened. Not what they had 
said, but we got to be very good at reading their

05:17.072 --> 05:24.642
propaganda or listening to it and figuring out 
what must have really happened. And we might not

05:27.941 --> 05:46.012
ever know exactly for sure, at least not within a 
short timeframe, but we'd be close enough

05:27.941 --> 05:46.012
to

05:27.941 --> 05:46.012
give us a more reasonable view of what was 
happening in the war and in the world and in our

05:27.941 --> 05:46.012
country. How did the news of, again, the anti-war 
protests things like that affect you? Did you

05:52.826 --> 05:58.094
think it was greatly exaggerated or did you think 
maybe they'd made the entire thing up? Initially,

05:58.174 --> 06:07.648
we did think it was greatly exaggerated because 
that hadn't been going on when people in my vintage

05:58.174 --> 06:07.648
of shoot-down were captured. Later on, it became 
apparent that there had to be some kind of a very

06:08.168 --> 06:15.118
substantial anti-war movement going on in this 
country. How did that affect your morale? Very

06:18.904 --> 06:20.346
disappointing. At the same time, all we had to do 
was look around a little bit when we were being

06:20.630 --> 06:38.131
marched to an interrogation and say, hey, I don't 
like what the protesters are doing, but I'd sure

06:20.630 --> 06:38.131
rather live in a country where you could do that 
than the way these folks have to live here. So we

06:38.792 --> 06:49.405
talked about the feelings of nationalism really 
carried a lot of people through there, and they

06:38.792 --> 06:49.405
grew and formed a common bond. That seems to go 
without saying. Can you talk a little bit about

06:51.853 --> 06:53.215
that? It was a whole lot easier for us, because in 
general terms, for us, it was very, very clear who

06:55.218 --> 07:07.313
were the good guys and who were the bad guys. The bad 
guys made it very clear who they were, and there

07:09.856 --> 07:14.862
wasn't any doubt about it. They wouldn't tolerate 
especially for the first five or six years,

07:19.895 --> 07:39.566
they wouldn't even tolerate somebody who just 
didn't constantly bump heads with them, much less

07:19.895 --> 07:39.566
somebody who was overtly hostile to them. And 
later on, that changed. Interesting, because I

07:44.353 --> 07:48.079
was going to ask you what you thought the 
difference between You hear so many people now,

07:49.139 --> 07:59.468
you know, writing books or speaking out against 
the war, and they're very bitter and cynical and

07:49.139 --> 07:59.468
jaded and think they've been betrayed. And then 
you'll speak to former POWs who say, very

07:59.849 --> 08:05.113
patriotic, very nationalistic. Do you think it's 
the two experiences that were so different? Yes.

08:09.277 --> 08:11.599
Very different.

08:13.481 --> 08:16.764
When we came home, we were treated like heroes. 
Like... We just, oh, let's see. I had to be careful

08:24.728 --> 08:27.151
when I came home what I admired. Because every time 
I turned around, whatever I admired, somebody

08:28.233 --> 08:31.316
would give to me. People just could not do enough 
for us.

08:39.506 --> 08:48.357
When the guys who went over there and did the same 
kind of thing I was doing before I got shot down,

08:39.506 --> 08:48.357
whether it was in the air or on the ground or out in 
the Gulf of Tonkin, When they came home,

08:49.366 --> 09:04.505
they were, in the

08:49.366 --> 09:04.505
minds of a lot of people in this country, held in 
less esteem than the Viet Cong. What do you think

09:04.525 --> 09:07.809
that is?

09:15.999 --> 09:18.883
I don't think there is a simple answer to that 
question. I think

09:19.673 --> 09:30.783
they were blamed for a lot of things they didn't do. 
The media did an abominable job on that war.

09:43.314 --> 09:48.398
As far as the media was concerned in general, 
whatever the Viet Cong did, was,

09:49.373 --> 10:02.092
oh, whether or not you agreed with their politics, 
if it was a brave kind of thing, you know, a little

09:49.373 --> 10:02.092
guy going up against a big giant, it was heroic. If 
they did something that we would consider

10:04.295 --> 10:15.071
abominable, it was no less than what was expected 
from them because they come from a different

10:04.295 --> 10:15.071
culture where human life is not held in high 
regard. When we...

10:20.238 --> 10:27.488
When we looked cross-eyed,

10:20.238 --> 10:27.488
we were condemned for it by the media. We were 
fighting in a situation that was unlike anything

10:29.832 --> 10:38.845
we had ever run up against before.

10:38.865 --> 10:40.848
We were fighting a communist enemy. We were 
fighting an Oriental enemy. The Orients

10:43.491 --> 10:44.693
overpopulated. Individual lives have not had the 
importance over there that they have in much of the

10:45.449 --> 10:51.778
rest of the world. You put that combination 
together, the Orient and communism, and for a

10:52.759 --> 11:09.863
mother to take her little baby and stuff a hand 
grenade in the diaper and have the little baby walk

10:52.759 --> 11:09.863
up to the jeep, blow up the jeep and a couple of GIs, 
to them was a heroic act. For us to turn around and

11:11.826 --> 11:14.089
shoot the mother for doing that, to keep her from 
killing a whole bunch more was absolutely

11:16.010 --> 11:22.497
unthinkable.

11:22.937 --> 11:25.400
I think that's a bit of a fault in our culture. And to 
a degree, the media had picked up on our culture in

11:26.421 --> 11:34.349
the way they interpreted things.

11:37.272 --> 11:45.460
But I

11:37.272 --> 11:45.460
would say As far as the Vietnam War was concerned, 
everything that I have seen that the media did,

11:45.794 --> 11:58.970
I would have to categorize as extremely 
subjective. There was no objectivity on their

11:58.990 --> 12:01.834
part at all. I was going to ask you this at the end, 
but I'll go ahead and jump to it. What do you feel

12:04.557 --> 12:14.670
about the, now there's this big media fad, you 
know, the Vietnam movies, all the Rambo stuff, the

12:04.557 --> 12:14.670
TV shows. Now everybody's a big hero, or it's kind 
of a display of everybody's personal

12:15.190 --> 12:22.119
experiences. I mean, there's a variety of 
attitudes about the war now. Do you feel that any of

12:25.643 --> 12:31.871
the films have been accurate, or are they just out 
to make a buck? Any of the TV shows? Why do you think

12:35.335 --> 12:37.278
suddenly it's such a big deal? OK.

12:43.912 --> 13:02.199
I'm not sure why it's such a big deal, but there 
seems to be a national willingness to go look at it

12:43.912 --> 13:02.199
now, when for years we didn't even want to think 
about it, much less look at it. Maybe distance? A

13:04.061 --> 13:05.604
little more objective?

13:07.606 --> 13:12.113
Well, there's a new generation that's looking at 
it now. And I'm sure that makes a difference. I

13:14.011 --> 13:17.334
don't know how to quantify how much difference it 
makes. I'm sure that kind of thing helps. As far as

13:22.899 --> 13:40.716
the quality of what I've seen, in general, the 
Hollywood and the made-for-TV movies,

13:22.899 --> 13:40.716
they are still...

13:42.940 --> 13:44.242
They're still down on Americans. It's not as, 
well, it is just about as hostile toward the

13:45.725 --> 13:58.346
American GI who fought in Southeast Asia now as the 
media was when it was going on. There are a few

14:00.750 --> 14:06.820
exceptions.

14:07.321 --> 14:07.902
There are very few. One of the first that I saw that I 
thought was good, and these are both connected

14:08.557 --> 14:22.051
with the POW thing, and I feel a little more 
qualified to talk there, but the first one made

14:08.557 --> 14:22.051
several years ago was when Hell was in Session, Hal 
Holbrook playing Jerry Dent.

14:26.556 --> 14:27.837
The second was more recent. The title of it was 
Hanoi Hilton.

14:34.564 --> 14:37.247
It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.

14:39.725 --> 14:48.996
not just Vietnam movies, but best movies, and the 
reason is

14:39.725 --> 14:48.996
it was atypical for a Hollywood movie. There 
wasn't a John Wayne who would walk in, overcome

14:51.338 --> 15:06.576
overwhelming odds, never feel fear or pain, or 
have a tear in his eye, and ride off into the sunset

14:51.338 --> 15:06.576
with just his horse when it was over. Sylvester 
Stallone. Yeah. It was real people who had some

15:09.885 --> 15:13.690
virtues and some weaknesses. And they were the 
guys that I knew there who did the best they could

15:15.673 --> 15:20.019
with what they had. They hurt. They cried. They had 
a few victories. But when it was over, they could

15:27.650 --> 15:32.998
still hold their heads up. And the irony of it was 
when it was over, 350 American POWs went to war

15:37.201 --> 15:48.415
against 17 million North Vietnamese, and the 
North Vietnamese had all the guns and the leg irons

15:37.201 --> 15:48.415
and the handcuffs and the bars and the keys, and we 
won. We accomplished what we wanted to do with

15:49.757 --> 15:55.804
regard to our relationship to them and to the war. 
They failed at what they wanted to do. with regard

16:00.944 --> 16:11.620
to, in respect to their relationship with us and 
their intentions as to how they were to exploit us

16:00.944 --> 16:11.620
for the war. That got a little bit off the track, but 
that movie The Hanoi Hilton

16:11.640 --> 16:24.039
was, it was really condemned before it ever got 
out. Because while she was not named, Jane Fonda in

16:25.281 --> 16:29.888
character appeared in the movie And I don't know 
whether Jane Fonda just has that many friends or

16:30.357 --> 16:36.565
what, but the movie was panned by the critics. And 
it shouldn't have been. I think one of the reasons

16:40.089 --> 16:47.778
that it turned out so good was the list of people 
they had as advisors in the credits. I knew those

16:48.119 --> 16:49.801
guys. And they listened to the people who were 
there. For a change. Yes, for a change. Well, let's

16:55.308 --> 16:59.773
jump back quickly to the very, very end when 
finally getting released. How did you, did you

17:00.074 --> 17:03.757
know it was coming? Did you know that the end was on 
its way? By increasing the treatment to where they

17:06.780 --> 17:12.225
used to, they were giving you more and more food, 
trying to make you look a little bit better. Did you

17:12.245 --> 17:15.568
get the hint that okay, the day is coming? We worked 
in probabilities and not absolutes. We used to,

17:21.674 --> 17:26.959
among ourselves, jokingly refer to

17:28.576 --> 17:43.473
the anticipation when we would see small or large 
improvements in our treatment, and the food, the

17:28.576 --> 17:43.473
way the guards acted to us, et cetera, we refer to 
times of improved treatment as peace scares.

17:44.795 --> 17:47.578
Because that seemed to be the way the North 
Vietnamese looked at it. Oh my gosh. We may have to

17:50.061 --> 17:51.662
give some of these guys back. We may have to stop 
prosecuting the war the way we are now. that was the

17:58.934 --> 18:01.257
reason for the nomenclature. And we knew that that

18:01.518 --> 18:17.540
things had reached a level regarding the 
potential for our release and proceeded onward

18:01.518 --> 18:17.540
that they hadn't reached before. The way the North 
Vietnamese were acting toward us, were treating

18:18.321 --> 18:21.826
us, etc. At the same time, Even after I was on the 
plane and the rest of the guys felt the same way

18:26.862 --> 18:37.056
headed out of Hanoi, we didn't relax and let all our 
weight down on the airplane until we were out of

18:26.862 --> 18:37.056
mid-range. Because there had been enough false 
starts and regressions to know that it's not over

18:38.058 --> 18:50.676
until it's really over. So it was a mixed bag. 
Tremendous anticipation. and matching desire,

18:56.258 --> 19:02.786
but great restraint. We've been disappointed so 
many times. What about the big reception in

19:06.190 --> 19:12.397
Washington, D.C.? President Nixon? Talk a little 
bit about that because I'm vaguely remembering

19:14.599 --> 19:21.928
that on television.

19:25.469 --> 19:31.217
What was their overall, maybe of your friends, 
their attitude towards Nixon as president?

19:31.238 --> 19:33.020
Because again, there was so much protest. And were 
you amazed to come back and find so much hostility

19:33.721 --> 19:39.269
towards him? Yeah, I was. First of all, I guess, 
like any mortal human being, Nixon's a little bit

19:44.657 --> 19:51.748
of a mixed bag. Some things he did toward the end, 
were dumb and shameful. Specifically with the

19:58.746 --> 20:00.728
bombings, perhaps? No, I'm not talking about the 
war. I'm talking about Watergate and those sort of

20:03.793 --> 20:07.578
things.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.547
He took a lot of heat over what he did at the end of the 
war. He was, at the same time, one of the first

20:16.470 --> 20:23.860
people to stand up, bite the bullet, and do what had 
to be done. We needed to bomb North Vietnam. We

20:28.130 --> 20:32.134
didn't want to, but that was the source of trouble. 
Specifically, we needed to bomb Hanoi, because

20:32.874 --> 20:36.838
that was the core of it. And until we did, the war 
wasn't going to end. I wish so much that some of the

20:42.263 --> 20:54.133
people who are critical of that sort of thing

20:42.263 --> 20:54.133
could be in a war and see what happens. Because in 
war, in this war, we were the only one that fought by

20:54.485 --> 20:59.991
any rules. And in general, any enemy you go up 
against, as far as we're concerned, isn't going to

21:01.593 --> 21:08.541
have any rules. The only rule is win if you can.

21:14.508 --> 21:21.316
When we started bombing North Vietnam, excuse me, 
when we started bombing Hanoi, the war was over.

21:23.258 --> 21:24.019
And... Let's see, what was his name, Bonnie, the 
senior officer?

21:31.094 --> 21:33.036
Flynn, General Flynn. He was a full colonel when he 
was shot down. But he said, when we started hearing

21:35.360 --> 21:45.254
the bombs fall on Hanoi, he said, we started 
packing our bags because we knew we were going home

21:35.360 --> 21:45.254
pretty soon, but they didn't stop right away. 
Watching the reaction of the North Vietnamese

21:46.095 --> 21:54.968
told the whole story of the war in a period of about a 
week there. and I guess the most concise

21:55.943 --> 22:22.980
description of it is one of the guards who low level 
interrogator who spoke a little bit of English

21:55.943 --> 22:22.980
coming up to one of the barred windows and opening 
the hatch and looking in at us kind of talking to us

21:55.943 --> 22:22.980
but not really talking to us

21:55.943 --> 22:22.980
and just incredulous look demeanor and attitude 
that had never been there before and basically his

22:25.222 --> 22:48.850
words were Nixon's gone crazy he's gonna kill us

22:25.222 --> 22:48.850
what had happened up to that point Barbara was 
North Vietnam had been able to conduct the war

22:50.298 --> 22:57.765
and exactly determine what the consequences of 
the war to them were going to be at any point along

22:50.298 --> 22:57.765
the way. And if they started feeling a little more 
discomfort than they wanted to, all they had to do

22:57.785 --> 23:06.194
was say, drop some kind of a hint that maybe they'd 
talk about peace. We'd stop the bombing in North

23:07.115 --> 23:08.877
Vietnam. We'd give them a chance to resupply in the 
North. We'd give them a chance to resupply in the

23:12.260 --> 23:14.222
South. We'd give them a chance to get ready to go all 
over again, build back up to full strength And then

23:21.247 --> 23:24.791
they'd say, no, we don't like you guys anymore. 
We're going to fight some more. And they played the

23:27.673 --> 23:35.501
on-again, off-again game all the way, and their 
idea was just to drag it out until we got tired of

23:27.673 --> 23:35.501
fighting. Because they weren't getting tired. 
Right. Well, they were getting tired, but they

23:39.726 --> 23:42.428
were willing to pay the price. At least their 
leaders were willing to keep making them pay the

23:43.189 --> 23:46.613
price. And they didn't really have a whole lot of 
other options anyway. the people who were doing

23:52.499 --> 24:21.257
the work when President Nixon ordered the bombing 
of Hanoi he

23:52.499 --> 24:21.257
didn't give them the option he took away the option 
they had had up to that point of deciding what their

23:52.499 --> 24:21.257
losses were going to be and he prosecuted the war 
the way a war ought to be prosecuted at least at that

23:52.499 --> 24:21.257
point if you're going to be in it And that is either 
you win it or you die trying.

24:28.507 --> 24:34.352
There isn't anything you gain by coming in second 
in a war. We didn't want to dominate North Vietnam.

24:38.717 --> 24:42.200
We didn't want to make North Vietnam capitalist or 
democratic. All we wanted them to do was stop

24:43.301 --> 24:47.205
forcefully exporting what they had. And when 
President Nixon started bombing Hanoi, He took

24:51.629 --> 25:02.179
their options away and, in effect, was saying, you 
guys stop and you end this on terms that are

24:51.629 --> 25:02.179
acceptable to us for your history. No other 
choices are we going to leave. As soon as that

25:06.864 --> 25:14.492
message was clearly communicated to North 
Vietnam, of course, Ho Chi Minh had died a few years

25:06.864 --> 25:14.492
earlier. But North Vietnamese leadership just 
suddenly had 32 chicklets showing between their

25:15.372 --> 25:20.978
lips. And it's, yes, sir, is there anything else we 
can do for you? That was their attitude at the

25:26.031 --> 25:28.054
negotiating table. It was their attitude toward 
us. Everything else. And as soon as we, in terms

25:31.838 --> 25:51.623
they could understand, which was for us, 
communicated to them that what they were doing was

25:31.838 --> 25:51.623
not going to be tolerated anymore and that the 
choice was theirs either to die trying it,

25:31.838 --> 25:51.623
continue to try it, or stop it and live, And the rest 
was just settling the details at that point.

26:01.810 --> 26:07.679
So when you finally met him at the dinner, what did 
he have to say to you? Or what possibly did you have

26:07.719 --> 26:09.741
to say to him? Well, I guess our message to him was 
thank you. Because he was the one who finally did

26:15.510 --> 26:21.238
not only what was necessary to end the war, at least 
at that point, and

26:22.130 --> 26:40.066
obtain an agreement from them to stop forcing 
their way on South Vietnam, which was what we had

26:22.130 --> 26:40.066
gone over there to do, too. So it let us win the war, 
even though we did it in adverse circumstances.

26:45.851 --> 26:48.874
But it also got us home. No other way would we have 
come home. There may have been a few trickle home,

26:51.458 --> 26:55.324
like a few guys they let go early. But they

26:56.746 --> 27:02.634
weren't going to let us go home. Not the entire 
group.

27:11.648 --> 27:20.200
Two weeks after I got home, Bonnie and I and another 
Dallas POW and his wife were invited by

27:11.648 --> 27:20.200
Congressman Teague, who had really been a friend 
to our families. And my family wasn't even in his

27:25.260 --> 27:30.167
district, but he had really been a friend to our 
families. He was an Aggie, by the way. The Teague

27:34.073 --> 27:35.895
building is named after him. Okay. Congressman 
Olin Teague. Something familiar. Right.

27:42.645 --> 27:43.426
He invited us. He was Mr. Veteran. He was Chairman 
of the House Veteran Affairs Committee, among

27:45.609 --> 27:50.136
other things, as well as the Space Committee. But

27:50.453 --> 27:58.185
he invited us to go with him to the National VFW 
Convention. Excuse me. It was the VFW dinner for

28:00.128 --> 28:03.133
Congress. At that time, he arranged for us to have a 
tour of the White House. You know, get the tickets

28:11.346 --> 28:15.091
for us, like the congressman can do. And it was to be 
a a private tour for the four of us, a guided tour,

28:17.065 --> 28:20.649
rather than a big group thing. While we were on the 
tour, obviously what happened behind the scenes

28:22.291 --> 28:30.479
was he called the president, said, hey, you got two 
POWs over there. So one of the president's staff

28:31.440 --> 28:40.971
men located us, said, President Nixon has heard 
that you're here. We'd like to have a visit with you

28:41.932 --> 28:44.254
in the Oval Office. So we were escorted in, the four 
of us, and spent a little over an hour, I guess, in

28:44.909 --> 28:53.699
the Oval Office. While we were there, Henry 
Kissinger came in. But we just got to, basically we

28:58.064 --> 29:05.432
got to sit down, the four of us, and have a nice talk 
with President Nixon. He was a man who had sat in a

29:06.794 --> 29:11.659
chair that, I would say, very few people could sit 
in and still keep their sanity and maybe sometimes

29:12.128 --> 29:41.832
he didn't he had he

29:12.128 --> 29:41.832
had probably the most intense and diverse 
pressures of any recent president anyway he was

29:12.128 --> 29:41.832
handed a bucket of worms when he came in i think the 
the fact of of his election uh the last one by the

29:42.166 --> 29:51.340
margin that it was, indicated that there was 
certainly a preference of what he was doing to the

29:42.166 --> 29:51.340
alternatives, at least as far as the nation was 
concerned. And I think that's probably the reason

29:51.480 --> 29:55.686
for the idea of the silent majority.

30:01.635 --> 30:10.688
My personal feeling was I think he felt glad to meet 
a friend. because that was the way he perceived us,

30:11.731 --> 30:16.876
at least compared to a lot of people. I don't mean a 
personal friend, but somebody who was friendly

30:16.956 --> 30:24.244
toward him instead of finding something about one 
of his policies to criticize. And I think he was

30:26.206 --> 30:41.502
just a very pulled and torn man during that time who 
had decided what he thought ought to be done and

30:26.206 --> 30:41.502
made some hard decisions to go ahead and do it, even 
though it was going to be unpopular. And it might

30:42.190 --> 30:45.735
cost him a whole lot more than he'd really like to 
pay. And I think it did. Would you like to talk at all

30:48.299 --> 31:00.578
a little bit about, so many people talk about their 
spiritual background and how within the camps

30:48.299 --> 31:00.578
that really got them through. Would you say that's 
something that was a necessity for you as you were

31:01.038 --> 31:06.286
there? Or was it something that developed while 
you were there? I would say it was something that

31:10.135 --> 31:17.542
was almost universally recognized.

31:18.683 --> 31:25.529
There were four men out of all the POWs that I knew, 
and I got to know almost all of them to some degree,

31:18.683 --> 31:25.529
who were professing atheists. The rest had some 
kind of profession of faith in God, as I know him as a

31:26.750 --> 31:33.717
Christian. Most were Christian. There were a few 
Jews.

31:40.375 --> 31:49.166
God was openly acknowledged, openly prayed to, 
and jointly prayed to. And

31:50.607 --> 32:07.007
there's absolutely no doubt in my mind, Barbara,

31:50.607 --> 32:07.007
that he's the one who protected us, who kept us 
alive, who even though he didn't give us as much as

32:07.510 --> 32:15.580
we would have liked to eat at times, he gave us 
enough to keep us alive. And enabled

32:15.600 --> 32:28.437
us to win the kind of victory I talked about a while 
ago where there was 17 million of them, 350 of us,

32:15.600 --> 32:28.437
and it wasn't even a fair fight for the North 
Vietnamese. We had about a number. That kind of

32:32.262 --> 32:33.383
thing There were just too many things that would 
have forced other results than what we saw. The

32:46.716 --> 32:59.316
North Vietnamese wanted nothing more of us than to 
get out of us what they could and kill us in the

32:46.716 --> 32:59.316
slowest, most painful way possible and cause 
grief to ourselves and our family and our nation.

32:59.336 --> 33:04.163
They caused a lot of grief, but they lost their 
objective. Would you ever, or have you,

33:06.218 --> 33:10.823
considered going back to visit? I know a lot of the, 
some of the vets and POWs go back for various

33:10.963 --> 33:17.710
reasons. Have you ever considered it or do you want 
to someday? I didn't leave anything there that I

33:21.514 --> 33:24.357
need.

33:27.481 --> 33:35.449
I, at least up to this point, as long as I'm given the 
choice, I would choose not to go back.

33:37.471 --> 33:38.953
it's still a dangerous place to be. And it's

33:40.895 --> 33:59.999
got a lot of memories that

33:40.895 --> 33:59.999
having once dealt with them, I'm happier and 
healthier leaving them alone. Yeah. Would you, if

34:02.001 --> 34:06.567
you were, from your personal opinion, going to 
recommend, say, several books that would, in your

34:06.817 --> 34:11.845
opinion, accurately describe the experience. 
What would those be? There have been so many

34:14.428 --> 34:15.550
written. For the interested scholar, what, in 
your opinion, would be a good thing to read? Okay,

34:20.237 --> 34:25.345
there are a lot of them that I have not read. I

34:25.365 --> 34:34.258
have not, those that I have read, I haven't read any 
bad ones. The ones that I've appreciated the most

34:35.926 --> 35:01.461
were In

34:35.926 --> 35:01.461
the Presence of Mine Enemies by Harold Rutledge, 
Passing of the Night by Robbery Reisner,

34:35.926 --> 35:01.461
With God in a POW Camp by Ralph Gaither, and the one 
that I just referred to you, In Love and War by Jim

34:35.926 --> 35:01.461
and Sybil Stockdale.

35:04.613 --> 35:14.449
I would say from a historical point of view, the 
book by Jim and Sybil Stockdale would be the most

35:04.613 --> 35:14.449
useful. They are both

35:16.972 --> 35:28.090
very active, very intelligent people and are able 
to

35:30.601 --> 35:37.873
to be more objective than most could be about 
things that impacted upon them so personally and

35:30.601 --> 35:37.873
so intensely. Okay. Well, good. There's so many to 
choose from. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

35:45.386 --> 35:46.888
You're welcome, Barbara.
