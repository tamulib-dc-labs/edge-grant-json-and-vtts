00:01.617 --> 00:02.458
General O.D. Butler.

00:06.021 --> 00:08.023
Today is August 8th, 1980. This is the third 
interview with General Butler. This is Terry

00:14.289 --> 00:16.371
Anderson and this is a test.

00:24.818 --> 00:27.541
This is the third interview with General O.D. 
Butler. Today is August 8th, 1980. This is Terry

00:29.863 --> 00:31.084
Anderson. During the last two interviews, we've 
discussed your early years, your education here

00:31.570 --> 00:40.419
at Texas A&M, and your active and some of your 
reserve duty in the Army. I'd like to turn now to the

00:41.420 --> 00:52.130
commands in the reserve that you've had and also to 
the attitudes and opinions on leadership and

00:41.420 --> 00:52.130
other aspects of military life. In 1955, you were 
the commander of the 343 Field Artillery

00:52.170 --> 00:58.396
Battalion. Why were you chosen?

01:03.397 --> 01:06.582
Well, I can't say exactly why. I

01:06.622 --> 01:12.451
was a fairly young major.

01:14.574 --> 01:32.121
Came back and immediately resumed activities in 
the Army Reserve in the early days, 1946, 47, even

01:14.574 --> 01:32.121
before the policy was established that there 
would be inactive duty pay for reserves of course

01:32.337 --> 02:01.635
our reserve activities prior to world war ii were 
voluntary and unpaid right so i was in activities

01:32.337 --> 02:01.635
there i suppose i had been one of the most 
consistent in participation over a long period of

01:32.337 --> 02:01.635
time had some seniority that was your first 
command wasn't it Well, it was the first

02:02.982 --> 02:04.644
battalion. Battalion command, right. Battery 
commander. Right, but I mean that was your first

02:07.487 --> 02:09.969
battalion-sized command. Yes, it was. What were 
your functions and duties? Well,

02:16.216 --> 02:31.892
a battalion of field artillery has a combat 
mission to support the infantry, our tank

02:16.216 --> 02:31.892
battalions.

02:34.387 --> 02:37.251
We attempted to carry that out. The battalion has 
three firing batteries equipped with pouchers, a

02:38.352 --> 02:46.783
headquarters battery, and a service battery. So 
there were five

02:46.803 --> 02:52.290
battery-sized units. Commander The Army said 
that the commander is responsible for everything

02:57.387 --> 03:05.856
his unit does or fails to do, so that's a summary of 
what you do as a commander. Okay, what did you do

03:06.116 --> 03:11.322
with the battalion? All right, the battalion

03:11.342 --> 03:24.255
was responsible for training

03:11.342 --> 03:24.255
for all of the table of organization, authorized 
positions,

03:25.855 --> 03:41.893
and responsible for maintaining the 
functionality of the substantial equipment that

03:25.855 --> 03:41.893
one has in a unit. So we would make out, of course, 
the objectives of training for a year. conduct the

03:51.117 --> 04:09.967
training and try to bring all of the unit members up 
to a maximum level of training prior to our two

03:51.117 --> 04:09.967
weeks of active duty for training, where we would 
go to an Army post and perform functions as any

03:51.117 --> 04:09.967
active Army unit would by those periods. How many 
men did you have, full strength? Oh, full

04:14.635 --> 04:15.977
strength. Of a battalion there would be something 
over 500 men. 500 men and what type of equipment did

04:20.880 --> 04:26.852
you have? We had 105 millimeter howitzers.

04:38.094 --> 04:38.775
Towed.

04:53.538 --> 04:54.260
How many 105's? Well actually for training we had 
two per firing battery. At that time we did not have

05:03.338 --> 05:07.267
full strength units. That's all we needed for 
training and when we would go to active duty we

05:07.287 --> 05:13.740
could draw additional houses from the units on the 
post where we were assigned if we needed them in

05:14.885 --> 05:24.553
addition to our own houses. Where was your 
headquarters? Headquarters was right here at

05:28.016 --> 05:30.579
College Station.

05:33.561 --> 05:43.930
In 1955, as I recall, we had just prepared the old 
Marion Pugh Lumber Company warehouse the

05:44.197 --> 05:49.503
government leased and we used that for a 
headquarters building. It was later converted to

05:49.523 --> 06:04.579
apartments after the U.S. Army Reserve Center was 
built on Carson Street between Color Station

05:49.523 --> 06:04.579
Bryan and the city limits of Bryan.

06:08.384 --> 06:10.626
Now in 1959 you changed command. You became the CEO 
of the 4th Howitzer Battalion. Why'd you change

06:15.297 --> 06:16.258
duty? We didn't change duty. That was just a 
redesignation of the same organization. Were you

06:24.086 --> 06:25.407
still a major at that time? I don't know. It seemed 
to me like I'd been promoted in the meanwhile.

06:30.953 --> 06:40.022
Actually, I commanded that battalion

06:30.953 --> 06:40.022
prior to 1951. I was a battalion commander when I 
went to do graduate work at Michigan State

06:40.357 --> 06:46.226
University in 1951. And

06:46.787 --> 06:56.242
I was a major at that time, but I got promoted to 
lieutenant colonel somewhere along in the middle

06:46.787 --> 06:56.242
50's. That's on the record there somewhere. I know 
I was kind of resentful. I commanded that

07:01.590 --> 07:04.215
battalion for three years as a major. And the 
Artillery, I mean the active army advisor

07:08.420 --> 07:22.260
assigned to us never recommended me for a 
promotion because he said I was too young to be

07:08.420 --> 07:22.260
promoted. I was a little resentful of that at the 
time, but it later proved to be an advantage. Well,

07:26.185 --> 07:32.755
according to your biographical sketch, you first 
became the commander in 1955. Well, 897th.

07:39.183 --> 07:40.745
Headquarters, 75th. You see in clear up here, 
352nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion. 49 to

07:47.973 --> 07:49.575
51. So that's when I first became a battalion 
commander. 1 July, 49. Okay.

07:59.867 --> 08:04.652
Now, how did you change from artillery to 
engineering? Okay, that was because the 90th

08:09.710 --> 08:17.237
Infantry Division, U.S. Army Reserve,

08:09.710 --> 08:17.237
was deactivated. It was during the McNamara era 
when he was the

08:19.179 --> 08:29.089
Secretary of Defense. They changed policies and 
decided to emphasize combat units in the National

08:37.469 --> 08:41.934
Guard and combat support units in the Army 
Reserve. So the 90th Infantry Division was

08:42.535 --> 09:00.377
deactivated and all of us in 90th Infantry 
Division units that wanted to be were reassigned

08:42.535 --> 09:00.377
to other Army Reserve units to vacancies if they 
existed. If not, we were assigned as over strength

09:02.984 --> 09:07.730
So I was first assigned as an over-strength 
officer to the 420th engineer brigade.

09:11.075 --> 09:12.456
What was your opinion of McNamara?

09:15.440 --> 09:26.595
Well, I thought he had a lot of genius, surrounded 
himself with brilliant people, sort of think tank

09:15.440 --> 09:26.595
group people. Though I thought at the time, and 
still believe that this probably was a mistake,

09:28.263 --> 09:43.686
that it weakened the Tova Reserve structure to 
concentrate, to make the changes that were made at

09:28.263 --> 09:43.686
that time. Did the Cold War and the 
Soviet-American tensions of the 1950s have

09:43.706 --> 09:52.660
anything to do with our effect in any way, the 
reserves?

09:55.324 --> 09:56.245
Well, sure.

10:01.220 --> 10:26.873
One Cold War effect

10:01.220 --> 10:26.873
that is advantageous to reserves is an actual 
draft or threat of a draft that would cause young

10:01.220 --> 10:26.873
people to choose between the possibility or 
probability of doing their service in the active

10:27.983 --> 10:34.049
forces are satisfying their requirement by 
membership in the reserves. To me, that's the main

10:36.371 --> 10:51.445
way that the reserves gain adequate support, 
recruiting, get the kind of talent required to be

10:36.371 --> 10:51.445
effective. Then during the 1950s, when you were in 
command, you did not have problems with reserve or

10:57.667 --> 11:00.390
getting volunteers? Well at that particular time 
with the Korean War and the draft as I recall we had a

11:01.352 --> 11:17.292
fairly substantial waiting list in all of our 
organizations so we could be very selective. And

11:17.312 --> 11:21.778
how would you select a potential officer or a 
potential enlisted man? Well actually the

11:23.020 --> 11:27.285
officers were selected by an entirely different 
method. Of course, at that time, we had access to a

11:30.734 --> 11:47.137
number of officers, and we looked at their 
qualifications for the vacancy we had, their

11:30.734 --> 11:47.137
military occupational specialty and their 
previous record. And of course, you can check

11:47.157 --> 11:53.486
those with the officer's efficiency report, 
which were required. Those reports were required

11:53.547 --> 11:55.990
and still are. wasn't too difficult to select the 
highest qualified officers. Now for enlisted

12:02.612 --> 12:25.555
men, of course, we

12:02.612 --> 12:25.555
selected them based upon their scores on their 
tests for

12:02.612 --> 12:25.555
recruitment, upon their desires to train. If they 
wanted to do certain specialties, let's say

12:29.820 --> 12:44.343
communications for which we had some vacancies 
and were willing to go to school to take those, we'd

12:29.820 --> 12:44.343
naturally get preference for that. As I recall at 
that time too, we were fortunate in being able to

12:44.363 --> 12:51.694
utilize the ROTC cadets

12:55.032 --> 13:15.777
it was very advantageous for the ROTC cadet to be in 
the Army reserves, because if they had three years

12:55.032 --> 13:15.777
of good service with the reserves prior to their 
being commissioned, they would automatically

12:55.032 --> 13:15.777
collect the longevity pay, which as I recall 
amounted to about $75 a month, and so they could

12:55.032 --> 13:15.777
start out higher. Of course, this would be an 
advantage all the time they were associated with

13:15.797 --> 13:21.724
the Army. And besides that, Obviously, they had an 
orientation toward the military, or they

13:23.467 --> 13:29.275
wouldn't have been in Texas A&M. They wouldn't 
have taken advance to ROTC, so they were the very

13:29.535 --> 13:34.161
best soldiers we could get.

13:37.125 --> 13:40.149
Now, you became the commander of the 420th in 1971. 
Do you remember what your aims were? Aims?

13:53.420 --> 14:03.894
I wanted to have the best engineer brigade in the 
Army Reserves and one of the very best Army Reserve

13:53.420 --> 14:03.894
military organizations. Okay, how did you go 
about that? Well, in the first place, a brigade

14:06.658 --> 14:20.997
headquarters like this could be very, very well 
supported around Texas A&M University because

14:06.658 --> 14:20.997
there are so many highly qualified and motivated 
reservists in this area.

14:23.272 --> 14:36.046
I was not a qualified engineer, so naturally I 
leaned heavily on selection of highly qualified

14:23.272 --> 14:36.046
engineers and gave them the maximum authority and 
responsibility I could. I leaned on their

14:36.066 --> 14:40.791
expertise to do the job. The main thing I would do 
for the different sections is to set their goals

14:40.811 --> 14:52.283
and help to select steps objectives and steps for 
achievement of these goals and objectives,

14:54.490 --> 15:01.678
whatever they might be. We had high demands on 
performance, and people that didn't come up to

15:03.600 --> 15:12.190
these standards, we'd try to find a better one to do 
that. What type of operations did you go on? Well,

15:17.696 --> 15:19.798
this was a wonderful experience. An engineer 
brigade like this, this one had two construction

15:24.022 --> 15:31.089
battalions and two combat battalions. And we 
could have home station projects for

15:33.051 --> 15:50.488
construction that would allow us to exercise all 
of the skills and utilize the equipment, as long as

15:33.051 --> 15:50.488
we worked for

15:33.051 --> 15:50.488
public service type units. For instance, we could 
construct things for Texas A&M University Did

15:56.152 --> 15:56.693
you? Oh, yes, we did some. For example? We had a 
utility detachment

15:59.196 --> 16:05.643
right here at the headquarters. A utility 
detachment does the same sort of things on an Army

16:05.763 --> 16:14.574
post as the Office of Physical Plants does at Texas 
A&M. We affiliated the utility detachment with

16:15.635 --> 16:21.842
the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, et 
cetera, at Texas A&M. We built some things, for

16:22.943 --> 16:26.007
instance, out at the Farmers Training School. 
quite a bit of activity there. And over the years,

16:29.729 --> 16:34.416
we've also done civic projects for the city of 
Bryan. We rehabilitated an old school house

16:36.079 --> 16:53.226
out on Highway 21, Dilley Shaw Tap Road, that's 
used for a mental health, mental retardation

16:36.079 --> 16:53.226
facility. We had a number of projects like that. 
Could you give me some specific examples of

16:57.061 --> 17:04.072
projects, for example, with Bryan and Texas A&M? 
Yes, we did construction for the city of Bryan on

17:04.693 --> 17:09.380
Little League Park. Did you really? Yes. 
Backstops, hauling dirt, leveling fields,

17:12.344 --> 17:17.492
whatever needed to be done. All of those were 
training projects for... Certain sections. And

17:23.372 --> 17:24.814
you do these on weekends? Sure. That's a great 
idea. We would have a continuing project. We

17:29.322 --> 17:39.598
probably couldn't accomplish it in one weekend

17:29.322 --> 17:39.598
duty for training, but over a year we'd get quite a 
lot done. Now that raises an interesting

17:39.950 --> 17:42.635
question. You're doing work for the university. 
You're doing work for the city, which means that

17:44.939 --> 17:54.916
they are not having bids from construction 
companies to do that. Yes. What did the

17:56.659 --> 18:00.265
businessmen in the community think of these 
projects? Well, they... policy of the Department

18:04.098 --> 18:11.205
of Defense is that the contractors in an area had to 
be supportive of these things. Usually we'd work

18:11.385 --> 18:18.671
on projects that were so small that they weren't 
really of interest to contractors. But as a part of

18:19.692 --> 18:33.345
our submission of such projects for approval by 
Fifth Army headquarters, and they in some cases

18:19.692 --> 18:33.345
might even have to forward projects to Department 
of Army for approval, We were required to show

18:34.355 --> 18:42.005
substantial evidence that there was an objection 
of the local contractors to what we were gonna do.

18:43.747 --> 18:58.886
That's a good question and it is an important thing 
but you know in some cases the same people that

18:43.747 --> 18:58.886
performed these functions on weekends were 
contractors themselves. So they Usually we're

19:01.625 --> 19:04.729
acquainted with contractors of different 
nature. For instance, Len Stewart, who's now the

19:05.390 --> 19:12.801
commander of the engineer brigade, is one of the 
good construction contractors in this area.

19:13.682 --> 19:14.303
Still is. Stewart and Thurmond. He built, for 
instance, a new baseball stadium over here that

19:16.266 --> 19:25.760
takes the name University S. Well, that's kind of a 
project that his contracting firm is interested

19:16.266 --> 19:25.760
in. Of course, that's out of the question for an 
Army Reserve unit to take on training project. But

19:33.398 --> 19:44.110
we could build, for instance, the shelters and 
slabs for the Furman's Training School, which we

19:33.398 --> 19:44.110
did in some cases. We could build the ponds around 
the animal science area. It's a swine center.

20:02.695 --> 20:04.297
Those are two of the... So the projects then you did 
were not major projects, but they were projects

20:04.317 --> 20:12.048
like the Little League Fields. That's very 
interesting. Yes. We didn't do everything around

20:15.072 --> 20:17.836
Little League Fields. We would take on, for 
instance, the leveling, the grading, the survey.

20:24.346 --> 20:26.929
Of course, we had a fine survey section. I remember 
my survey section was the first one to lay out the

20:26.969 --> 20:31.015
polo field on the... photo grounds out here, Texas 
A&M, and also our motor graders dump trucks did

20:31.872 --> 20:40.566
some work related to that. We repainted and 
rehabilitated one of the homes used by some of the

20:42.950 --> 20:53.146
welfare agencies of the city of Bryan. I see. What 
about on your two weeks? excursions. Tell me about

20:58.318 --> 21:00.361
the type of operations you did there. Okay

21:00.641 --> 21:10.014
depending upon whether it was a combat battalion 
or a construction battalion. A construction

21:10.195 --> 21:24.475
battalion would work with the post engineer for 
instance if we went to Camp Willis near San

21:10.195 --> 21:24.475
Antonio, Texas or to let's say Fort Hood which we 
did sometime

21:25.805 --> 21:55.305
we would work well in advance with the post 
engineer and be given projects where he would

21:25.805 --> 21:55.305
furnish the materials we would prepare the plans 
and do the actual construction and our

21:25.805 --> 21:55.305
requirements were that these projects would 
train all of the people in the various military

21:25.805 --> 21:55.305
occupational specialties that we had and would 
utilize fully our equipment at the time we were on

21:55.488 --> 22:01.335
the two weeks active duty for training. We went to 
Fort Sill, Oklahoma. We went to Albuquerque, New

22:06.360 --> 22:08.563
Mexico. Had an airlift up there one time, moved 
construction to construction companies up there

22:08.823 --> 22:15.410
by military airlift. Now was that under your 
command or was that under General Hanover's

22:15.690 --> 22:18.934
command? I know he was talking- Hanover was 
commanding when we did that particular And you

22:24.648 --> 22:26.571
were his deputy at that time? I was, yes. And did you 
continue the airlifts under your command? Well,

22:30.817 --> 22:35.383
we, I'm not sure whether we had an additional one. 
We requested airlifts all the way to Germany. We

22:38.447 --> 22:39.209
never got it. Oh, did you really? During our 
command, but since then, the brigade has been

22:40.270 --> 22:50.925
authorized,

22:40.270 --> 22:50.925
the Corps Engineer Section, affiliated with 
Third Corps actually at Fort Hood, Texas. And they

22:55.467 --> 22:57.850
went to Germany this past summer. Part of their 
activities. So we did seek overseas assignments.

23:05.480 --> 23:09.645
We had some pretty exotic assignments, all right. 
Our two utility detachments were at,

23:10.767 --> 23:19.798
were in Arkansas. when the big Vietnam refugee 
group came in, Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. So we

23:28.509 --> 23:39.786
actually performed, about a month before the 
arrival of these refugees, we performed exactly

23:28.509 --> 23:39.786
the same kind of duties that those utility 
detachments would on mobilization. That is, we

23:39.806 --> 23:48.098
prepared housing, put in plumbing, reactivated 
some of the old facilities at Fort Chaffee. Got

23:48.297 --> 23:54.026
involved in rehabilitation of the whole sewage 
disposal system up there. Exactly the same sort of

23:56.489 --> 24:01.677
duties the soldiers would have been doing. You 
prepared the camp then for the refugees. That's

24:04.020 --> 24:04.942
right, sure did. Did you? We assisted them, of 
course. Sure, there were others. There was an

24:09.348 --> 24:12.373
active army engineer battalion down there too. As 
a matter of fact, they used a lot of our equipment.

24:15.017 --> 24:17.781
After we left, the equipment stayed there. one of 
the battalions of the 101st Airborne Division was

24:18.740 --> 24:32.593
there using our equipment and working on certain 
aspects of the post to ready that for the Vietnam

24:18.740 --> 24:32.593
refugees. Now that was under your command. Did you 
visit Port Chaffee? Of course. I stayed there. Our

24:38.699 --> 24:42.082
headquarters was there for two or three years. So 
you stayed there during when the refugees were

24:42.482 --> 24:46.346
incoming? Yes. Can you tell me, that's a rather 
important historical event, can you tell me about

24:47.815 --> 24:51.381
that? Well they... What were their conditions and 
what were the people like? Well the refugees were

24:58.533 --> 25:13.097
crowded into army barracks there, but that was so 
much better than they'd been in that they were

24:58.533 --> 25:13.097
appreciated very much. because we've had some 
demonstration by Cubans up there in the same

25:13.870 --> 25:26.602
facilities this year, and apparently some of 
those Cubans were not the most desirable kind of

25:13.870 --> 25:26.602
people. But as far as I know, there was never any 
problem with any of the Vietnamese. They were

25:31.567 --> 25:33.829
crowded. They were uncomplaining about living in 
the old World War II type wooden barracks. Of

25:41.393 --> 25:45.457
course, they had full medical support from the 
Army hospital there. And of course, there were a

25:47.519 --> 25:50.122
number of births. And gosh, I've forgotten. 
There's somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 of

25:51.723 --> 25:55.147
those refugees there. During all the time they 
were there, they were fairly well restricted to

25:56.068 --> 26:01.113
barracks area. This area was, of course, 
accessible to us during working hours as we worked

26:01.173 --> 26:08.901
on facilities, but off limits. And of course, the 
Vietnamese were carefully contained in these

26:11.515 --> 26:13.978
areas at the time.

26:17.042 --> 26:23.931
They appeared to be healthy enough and

26:17.042 --> 26:23.931
seemed very happy to be over here. How about 
schooling? Was there an effort made to teach them

26:25.493 --> 26:28.637
English or anything like that? I'm not sure about 
that. I know that The active army people there had

26:35.596 --> 26:42.428
programs going on with guns, I'm not aware of what 
it was. How about food? This is an oriental now,

26:44.111 --> 26:47.978
eating American food, is that right? They were 
eating? Yes, they were. How'd they adjust to that?

26:51.264 --> 26:53.248
They seemed to be very, very well.

26:56.674 --> 26:59.359
There's such a variety of food.

27:04.233 --> 27:10.662
taken care of on food in the army that there just 
wasn't any problem with that. I'm sure that they

27:10.682 --> 27:24.320
adjusted the ration some, the increased supply of 
rice or that sort of thing to adjust as much as they

27:10.682 --> 27:24.320
could to the previous diet of the Vietnamese. 
However, I think they took to American diets

27:24.560 --> 27:30.949
fairly well too. Now you said they were happy to be 
here. Did you say that because they seemed

27:33.962 --> 27:40.708
friendly and smiled a lot, they were a good 
disposition, or why? Well,

27:42.830 --> 27:49.536
Orientals are somewhat inscrutable. They don't 
smile a lot, apparently, but of course they, in

27:49.596 --> 28:00.987
this particular group of people, there were a lot 
of high-class professional people. They seemed

28:02.485 --> 28:08.794
to have well-recognized leaders who interacted 
with the military personnel. They seemed to be

28:09.055 --> 28:20.231
well-disciplined and that is that they were quite 
cooperative.

28:24.177 --> 28:27.902
So those were characteristics I noted, not any 
great expression of exuberance or happiness or

28:29.485 --> 28:38.975
demonstrativeness like we might expect of the 
same age people, Americans. How about the

28:39.515 --> 28:46.542
relations between the Arkansas people and the 
Vietnamese? Well there were actually no

28:46.562 --> 28:51.968
interactions at that time at all. As I say, at that 
time the Vietnamese were brought in there by air to

28:51.988 --> 28:59.155
the near nearby air base, they were brought into 
this compound

28:59.590 --> 29:07.421
and restricted to it. Of course, early on they did 
start relocating these refugees to places that

29:08.202 --> 29:16.093
wanted them. Houston or Dallas or wherever. Those 
arrangements seemed to go quite well.

29:26.523 --> 29:34.353
And of course, as we got into Fort Smith, Arkansas 
and around, it did stimulate business there. For

29:34.793 --> 29:50.873
instance, the post engineer went into Fort Smith 
and bought every hammer he could find anywhere to

29:34.793 --> 29:50.873
outfit all the people that started 
rehabilitating the quarters around Fort

29:34.793 --> 29:50.873
Chaffee. So there was a lot of local purchase of 
different things. How did your men perform under

29:56.695 --> 30:03.122
your command at Fort Jaffe? Outstanding. Both of 
my utility detachments received very high

30:04.423 --> 30:10.990
ratings for what they did. Now you see, they 
normally would have been living in these same

30:11.010 --> 30:20.040
barracks, or my whole organization might have 
been in there. But during this time, we were living

30:20.060 --> 30:22.503
in tents. We were not provided quarters as good as 
the Vietnamese refugees were. But our men very

30:29.551 --> 30:34.719
willingly worked long hours and were dedicated to 
doing the job. Was it because their quarters

30:36.181 --> 30:38.144
weren't as good? Did you think they were 
resentful? No, not at all. They knew it was a

30:42.111 --> 30:44.755
temporary thing with them of course. They had 
lived in tents before. Well-led,

30:50.780 --> 30:56.969
well-disciplined troops don't mind such things 
as that. How many men were there on these two

30:56.989 --> 30:59.352
detachments? The utility detachments have about 
50 people in each detachment. And how much time did

31:07.503 --> 31:09.126
you spend up there? Well, each time the utility 
detachment was there, if I was the only one there, I

31:10.648 --> 31:20.702
would usually visit for one day or two days to look 
over all their projects.
