00:03.727 --> 00:08.814
Was Silver Tap celebrated off of the roof of the 
academic building like it is now? Was Sully's

00:11.338 --> 00:15.764
statue already there when you were a student? Yes. 
Did you all celebrate Aggie Muster on April 21st?

00:24.196 --> 00:31.888
Sure

00:24.196 --> 00:31.888
did. Texas celebrated. Oh, I agree. I think 
musters, silver taps, midnight yell practice,

00:34.690 --> 00:49.668
final review, and commencements, I think, are 
some of the key events in building Aggie pride.

00:57.117 --> 00:57.477
That's right. I'm going to do the muster this year 
in Nashville, Tennessee. This will be my 25th

01:01.466 --> 01:04.029
muster speech. I'm one of the few people that has 
ever done the muster speech at College Station

01:05.250 --> 01:15.680
that doesn't have an Aggie degree or wasn't a 
four-star general.

01:21.005 --> 01:25.810
When final review was held then, Was it held on the 
place that we call the drill field today?

01:33.803 --> 01:39.351
Did your parents come for graduation and 
commissioning?

01:39.892 --> 01:40.252
Yes, sir. And they came on the train. Do you 
remember anybody who owned a car when you were a

01:44.719 --> 01:48.945
student?

01:51.569 --> 01:55.695
Because I presume no student had a car.

01:56.958 --> 01:59.461
What was your Corps outfit's name? B-1. B-1. Did 
you all have a nickname?

02:22.493 --> 02:22.893
Yes, sir. Let's see. Was that an infantry outfit? 
Did the cavalrymen play polo then? I

02:30.620 --> 02:37.228
don't remember. You weren't involved in any of the 
athletic teams. You weren't a member of the...

02:42.675 --> 02:49.444
What were your favorite extracurricular 
activities? What did you do for pleasure?

03:01.201 --> 03:05.406
Did you spend much time in the library studying?

03:14.415 --> 03:21.963
And I understand that a freshman could not be 
harassed while he was in the library studying.

03:26.408 --> 03:31.073
Now, on Saturday nights, where did you and your 
buddies go to celebrate?

03:34.546 --> 03:35.467
Where you could hide? Did y'all go to the rock pits, 
the clay pits? Were those places to swim then?

03:46.097 --> 03:49.501
Later there would be some gravel pits where they 
swam. Did y'all do that?

03:56.647 --> 03:57.288
Oh, okay. Not anymore. But there was then a fish 
tank? And what did you wear when you were swimming

04:03.689 --> 04:06.794
in the fish tank?

04:10.800 --> 04:11.762
Did you wear anything?

04:14.667 --> 04:19.094
Do you remember going to Houston ever just for fun?

04:23.180 --> 04:24.202
Football game only. And let's see, did Rice play 
football yet?

04:31.870 --> 04:35.436
Who was your favorite opponent in football? 
Texas? Still is. Still is.

04:47.116 --> 04:47.616
I agree. But one of the things that I think is good 
today, that every time Texas achieves something,

04:48.638 --> 04:58.114
we want to outdo them. and vice versa, so we are both 
getting better, trying to be better than each

04:58.685 --> 05:07.737
other, and the people of Texas gain. Are you proud 
to be a Texan? Yeah, I'm proud. That's right. I

05:13.044 --> 05:13.685
agree with you. I agree. How long has your family 
lived in Texas?

05:22.016 --> 05:22.617
My father was born in Alabama. Alabama. Came to 
Texas. Oh,

05:26.512 --> 05:37.808
that's a lot.

05:43.797 --> 05:46.140
So he would have come in the 1880s?

05:50.346 --> 05:52.730
Where did he first live in Texas? West Texas. And 
when did your family move to Uvalde?

06:04.548 --> 06:24.379
Oh,

06:04.548 --> 06:24.379
I see.

06:25.068 --> 06:48.865
Ah.

06:56.810 --> 07:00.964
something about first time ever town club

07:27.978 --> 07:55.437
So,

07:27.978 --> 07:55.437
I thought about it, and I thought about it, and I 
thought about it, and I thought about it, and I

07:27.978 --> 07:55.437
said, She

07:57.712 --> 08:19.230
told me.

08:40.928 --> 08:54.987
In

08:40.928 --> 08:54.987
those days, did students take Spanish very often? 
No. What about German? Did you take German in high

08:58.771 --> 09:00.233
school? Because I know during World War I, I have 
read that we quit teaching German because of the

09:02.356 --> 09:09.045
war. I

09:10.088 --> 09:19.423
went to get

09:10.088 --> 09:19.423
it. I knew it was going to be in the army. I went 
there, barely.

09:26.193 --> 09:28.878
I said, T.C., see, you're going to start planning 
for it. I came along and took all of those

09:28.898 --> 09:34.807
in. I went. I said, T.C., get ready to go to war.

09:57.035 --> 10:12.411
I'm

09:57.035 --> 10:12.411
going to write a poem about it.

10:31.578 --> 10:42.366
When you would ride the train to and from College 
Station, you went from College Station to where on

10:31.578 --> 10:42.366
the train? To Houston?

11:11.605 --> 11:17.772
And did you go through San Antonio?

11:32.729 --> 11:38.055
Now, while you were at A&M, was your father 
ranching or farming? Farming. Farming. And his

11:39.989 --> 11:42.533
cash crops were what? Cotton? Onions. Onions. 
What kind of onions then? White? Bermuda onions?

11:52.690 --> 11:52.830
Yellow. How many acres? I don't remember the

11:54.493 --> 12:00.343
name. He gave me an acre. And that helped to pay your 
way. $60.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.364
Now, where was he growing onions? Near what town?

12:13.849 --> 12:14.350
Near Mellon?

12:18.635 --> 12:20.418
Did he own the land or did he rent it? He owned it? 
When had he bought it?

12:31.893 --> 12:34.937
What is that land used for now?

12:37.988 --> 12:38.669
Is that right? And how many, did he grow onions on 
the same ground year after year?

12:50.467 --> 12:56.175
Have you, since you've been in the agriculture, 
have you ever grown onions?

13:01.023 --> 13:02.665
Because that was tough work, wasn't it? Onions 
made more money per acre than cotton. Oh yeah,

13:09.511 --> 13:13.055
can't beat that. Can't beat...

13:14.036 --> 13:28.331
My.

13:28.351 --> 13:29.993
That's a lot of money in that time. That's a lot. 
Alright, then when you got out of A&M, you first

13:32.135 --> 13:37.881
went to work for the 4-H?

13:41.759 --> 13:43.181
How did you get that job?

14:08.318 --> 14:09.319
Did you enjoy it? Did that take you all over the 
state? Who were the people that you remember that

14:15.531 --> 14:19.277
were helpful?

14:36.726 --> 14:37.247
What kind of? Tell me what you did in that capacity. 
Did you speak or work with the high school

14:41.165 --> 15:00.433
teachers?

15:29.945 --> 15:33.130
What was your, do you remember what your pay was in 
that first job?

15:38.900 --> 15:40.162
$450 a year. And you lived where?

15:46.132 --> 15:48.435
On the campus at A&M. For how long did you live 
there?

15:55.347 --> 15:56.188
Two or three years. And traveled by train. You were 
on the road about half the time? So

16:02.104 --> 16:21.231
you learned from missing that train one time.

16:35.774 --> 16:38.073
It would be a nice love. I never, but it's just 
right.

17:03.297 --> 17:08.629
Tell me about what the Depression did to people in 
Texas. How bad was it?

17:35.984 --> 17:48.797
What

17:35.984 --> 17:48.797
did you do during the Depression? You continued to 
work.

17:59.327 --> 18:05.653
Now, did the Depression affect one part of 
agriculture more than others? All of it. So cattle

18:08.663 --> 18:22.316
and cotton and everything.

18:22.336 --> 18:22.777
Let's see. Let me stop this and let you take a rest 
now, and I'll come back after lunch.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.670
As World War II approached, What were you doing in 
the late 30s, early 40s?

18:45.493 --> 18:54.050
You were still with the extension?

18:54.070 --> 18:54.270
Oh.

19:03.481 --> 19:09.897
Carmen, Crayman, Hello, Crayman, Plainfield, 
all the banks in the world.

19:44.251 --> 19:55.054
I

19:44.251 --> 19:55.054
think you're right, I know it.

20:41.103 --> 20:43.418
When did you meet Gus Wortham?

22:48.627 --> 23:00.298
During

22:48.627 --> 23:00.298
how involved in politics were you in the 1930s? Did 
you have to go to Austin often to lobby for

23:00.818 --> 23:06.263
agriculture?

23:13.490 --> 23:17.233
So you didn't have to work with W. Leo Daniel or... 
Jimmy Allred or?

23:22.047 --> 23:23.869
No, I knew him all. If you describe Governor 
O'Daniel for me then, please. You say you knew him.

23:39.326 --> 23:39.667
A wheeler dealer. A wheeler dealer? Yeah. Was he 
honest? And physically, big, small?

23:54.090 --> 23:55.033
Excuse me, go ahead.

24:26.468 --> 24:26.996
Wait.

25:08.065 --> 25:24.109
I

25:08.065 --> 25:24.109
said, can you raise that money? He said, I can raise 
it. I said, I can raise it. He said, I can raise it. I

25:25.611 --> 25:26.072
said, I can raise it. He said, I can raise it. I said, 
I can raise it.

25:44.228 --> 25:51.821
of the agricultural groups during that time, 
which one had the greatest political influence?

25:54.646 --> 25:55.548
Was it the cattlemen?

26:02.740 --> 26:04.363
And the Farm Bureau?

26:20.813 --> 26:23.617
Which governors cared most about agriculture?

26:26.481 --> 26:26.741
Conley. Conley? Now, that causes me to ask, of all 
the governors you know, which governors made the

26:29.285 --> 26:41.061
best appointments, appointed the best people to 
boards and agencies? I believe Conley. That's the

26:43.063 --> 26:44.585
answer everybody gives. Good for everybody. I've 
asked, how did he select good people? And two or

26:51.455 --> 27:01.065
three folks have said he would tell his staff a long 
time in advance, I need to appoint members to the

26:51.455 --> 27:01.065
whatever it is. Bring me a list of all the quality 
people that I ought to consider. And then from that

27:10.455 --> 27:15.981
list, he selected high quality people. You were 
mentioning a while ago when you and Governor

27:16.872 --> 27:25.728
Daniel chatted before your A&M appointment. How 
did your name come to his attention? Who proposed

27:30.837 --> 27:32.821
you or recommended you? Do you know? Who?

27:41.932 --> 27:47.041
And do you know how many others he considered when 
he considered you?

27:51.930 --> 27:56.278
Did he ask you any other questions except 
co-education questions?

28:34.042 --> 28:35.986
Did you ever work with Gib Gilchrist?

28:44.242 --> 28:47.528
Tell me about him, please, about Mr. Gilchrist.

29:03.961 --> 29:05.503
Did he do a good job at A&M?

29:09.128 --> 29:28.012
His son Henry told me that when they moved there, 
that he, the son, didn't like it because after

29:09.128 --> 29:28.012
living in Austin, College Station seemed so 
small, but that his father then bribed him by

29:09.128 --> 29:28.012
giving him a new bicycle. He was 13 years old. And he 
said that almost every faculty member and staff

29:30.168 --> 29:43.493
member lived on the campus and that he thought it 
was a long way from College Station to anywhere

29:30.168 --> 29:43.493
else. He also said that College Station was not yet 
incorporated so that when Mr. Bryan up at the First

29:55.092 --> 30:14.082
National Bank in Bryan planned to annex College 
Station that his father as Dean of Engineering and

29:55.092 --> 30:14.082
some others on the campus got busy and 
incorporated College Station. Did any of you

30:16.365 --> 30:20.712
former students help with that?

30:25.788 --> 30:43.329
This boy,

30:25.788 --> 30:43.329
the president of the bank, the father, the 
stepfather, fired me with a gun, with a gun. I said,

30:43.349 --> 30:43.830
give me the gun. Out of the way.
