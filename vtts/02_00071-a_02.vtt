00:03.710 --> 00:08.795
Was Silver Tap celebrated off of the roof of the academic building like it is now?

00:11.298 --> 00:15.763
Was Sully's statue already there when you were a student?

00:19.387 --> 00:32.080
Did you all celebrate Aggie Muster on April 21st?

00:33.275 --> 00:33.996
Oh, I agree.

00:34.657 --> 00:49.656
I think musters, silver taps, midnight yell practice, final review, and commencements, I think, are some of the key events in building Aggie pride.

00:56.925 --> 00:57.426
That's right.

00:57.929 --> 01:01.395
I'm going to do the muster this year in Nashville, Tennessee.

01:01.455 --> 01:04.020
This will be my 25th muster speech.

01:05.242 --> 01:19.988
I'm one of the few people that has ever done the muster speech at College Station that doesn't have an Aggie degree or wasn't a four-star general.

01:20.913 --> 01:29.405
When Final Review was held then, was it held on the place that we call the drill field today?

01:33.791 --> 01:39.840
Did your parents come for graduation and commissioning?

01:39.860 --> 01:40.221
Yes, sir.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.444
And they came on the train.

01:44.707 --> 01:49.013
Do you remember anybody who owned a car when you were a student?

01:51.524 --> 01:54.088
Because I presume no student had a car.

01:56.531 --> 01:56.952
No student had a car.

01:56.972 --> 01:59.455
What was your core outfit's name?

02:00.597 --> 02:01.038
B-1.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.099
B-1.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.742
Did y'all have a nickname?

02:17.642 --> 02:17.702
No.

02:17.722 --> 02:18.603
At the time, we got one student in the room.

02:18.623 --> 02:19.244
Remember, I've been back there.

02:19.264 --> 02:19.945
He said, you're pretty sick today.

02:21.764 --> 02:22.845
Yes, sir.

02:23.526 --> 02:25.268
Let's see, was that an infantry outfit?

02:27.110 --> 02:30.594
Did the cavalrymen play polo then?

02:36.481 --> 02:42.488
You weren't involved in any of the athletic teams?

02:42.649 --> 02:43.890
You weren't a member of the...

02:46.216 --> 02:49.379
What were your favorite extracurricular activities?

02:49.479 --> 02:51.782
What did you do for pleasure?

03:01.632 --> 03:05.396
Did you spend much time in the library studying?

03:13.265 --> 03:13.405
Mm-hmm.

03:14.245 --> 03:21.938
And I understand that a freshman could not be harassed while he was in the library studying.

03:26.365 --> 03:30.892
Now, on Saturday nights, where did you and your buddies go to celebrate?

03:34.579 --> 03:35.480
Where you could hide?

03:37.003 --> 03:37.924
Did...

03:39.068 --> 03:42.914
Did you all go to the rock pits, the clay pits?

03:42.934 --> 03:45.217
Were those places to swim then?

03:46.078 --> 03:49.503
Later there would be some gravel pits where they swam.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.364
Did you all do that?

03:56.633 --> 03:57.274
Oh, okay.

03:59.097 --> 04:03.784
Not anymore, but there was then a fish tank?

04:03.804 --> 04:06.848
And what did you wear when you were swimming in the fish tank?

04:08.937 --> 04:11.740
Did you wear anything?

04:14.622 --> 04:19.046
Do you remember going to Houston ever just for fun?

04:23.130 --> 04:24.171
Football game only.

04:25.152 --> 04:28.916
And let's see, did Rice play football yet?

04:31.919 --> 04:35.442
Who was your favorite opponent in football?

04:35.962 --> 04:36.683
Texas?

04:37.996 --> 04:39.618
It still is.

04:44.903 --> 04:45.144
It still is.

04:45.164 --> 04:45.624
I'd rather be in Texas.

04:45.644 --> 04:47.066
All the rest are good to be.

04:47.086 --> 04:47.546
I agree.

04:48.587 --> 05:07.868
But one of the things that I think is good today, that every time Texas achieves something, we want to outdo them, and vice versa, so we are both getting better trying to be better than each other, and the people of Texas gain.

05:09.282 --> 05:10.643
Are you proud to be a Texan?

05:12.205 --> 05:12.545
Yeah, I'm right.

05:12.565 --> 05:12.846
That's right.

05:12.886 --> 05:13.627
I agree with you.

05:14.187 --> 05:14.668
I agree.

05:15.649 --> 05:19.172
How long has your family lived in Texas?

05:20.313 --> 05:33.928
My father was born in Alabama.

05:33.948 --> 05:34.108
Alabama.

05:34.128 --> 05:34.668
Came to Texas 16, 17 years.

05:34.688 --> 05:35.129
He was kind of bigger.

05:35.149 --> 05:35.689
He picked 350 pounds a day.

05:35.709 --> 05:36.871
Oh, that's a lot.

05:37.912 --> 05:38.192
Couldn't pick.

05:39.050 --> 05:46.138
So, he would have come in the 1880s?

05:50.303 --> 05:52.685
Where did he first live in Texas?

05:55.048 --> 05:55.649
West Texas.

05:56.930 --> 05:59.934
And when did your family move to Uvalde?

06:04.519 --> 06:08.263
Oh.

06:11.821 --> 06:35.938
Oh I see.

06:48.507 --> 07:07.799
Ah.

07:07.819 --> 07:08.460
I remember something about that.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.321
First time I've ever heard of a town club.

07:09.341 --> 07:09.582
A town club.

07:09.602 --> 07:09.842
A town club.

07:09.862 --> 07:10.103
A town club.

07:10.123 --> 07:10.363
A town club.

07:10.383 --> 07:10.623
A town club.

07:10.643 --> 07:10.884
A town club.

07:10.904 --> 07:11.144
A town club.

07:11.164 --> 07:11.405
A town club.

07:11.425 --> 07:11.665
A town club.

07:11.685 --> 07:11.926
A town club.

07:11.946 --> 07:12.186
A town club.

07:27.978 --> 07:53.057
So I found out about it.

07:53.077 --> 07:54.800
I went to work with the daily class, but I started to, like, take it out, take it out.

07:54.820 --> 07:55.241
And told me about it.

07:55.261 --> 07:55.521
I don't know.

07:59.028 --> 08:21.365
I didn't tell her I memorized it.

08:21.385 --> 08:22.366
She got that B in that, but I didn't do anything.

08:22.386 --> 08:22.807
I didn't memorize it.

08:22.827 --> 08:23.508
Anyway, she told me what they did.

08:23.528 --> 08:23.929
They were very good.

08:23.949 --> 08:24.630
They didn't tell me what they did.

08:40.945 --> 08:54.946
In those days, did students take Spanish very often?

08:56.389 --> 08:56.489
No.

08:57.490 --> 08:58.272
What about German?

08:58.752 --> 09:00.215
Did you take German in high school?

09:02.338 --> 09:09.028
Because I know during World War I, I have read that we quit teaching German because of the war.

09:10.055 --> 09:13.158
The proper soul.

09:13.179 --> 09:26.153
And I went to the head because I was going to get in.

09:26.173 --> 09:27.755
And I knew it was going to be in the Army.

09:27.775 --> 09:28.356
And I wasn't there very long.

09:28.376 --> 09:29.377
And they say, see, you know, it's a turning point.

09:29.397 --> 09:29.537
Mm-hmm.

09:29.557 --> 09:31.059
Took all of us in.

09:31.079 --> 09:31.359
I see.

09:35.003 --> 09:36.805
I said, T.C., getting ready to go to war.

09:56.782 --> 10:11.546
Right.

10:11.566 --> 10:11.686
Right.

10:11.706 --> 10:11.827
Right.

10:11.847 --> 10:11.967
Right.

10:11.987 --> 10:12.107
Right.

10:31.544 --> 10:42.320
When you would ride the train to and from College Station, you went from College Station to where on the train?

10:42.380 --> 10:42.981
To Houston?

10:49.611 --> 10:49.671
No.

11:11.588 --> 11:17.735
And did you go through San Antonio?

11:32.693 --> 11:38.039
Now, while you were at A&M, was your father ranching or farming?

11:38.840 --> 11:39.241
Farming.

11:39.461 --> 11:39.621
Farming.

11:39.972 --> 11:42.896
And his cash crops were what, cotton?

11:44.058 --> 11:44.198
Onions.

11:44.218 --> 11:44.399
Onions.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.702
What kind of onions then?

11:47.383 --> 11:49.006
White, Bermuda onions?

11:52.771 --> 11:53.052
White, yellow.

11:53.072 --> 11:53.492
How many acres?

11:54.474 --> 11:57.839
I don't remember that.

11:57.859 --> 12:00.723
They gave me an acre.

12:00.743 --> 12:02.145
And that helped to pay your way.

12:02.165 --> 12:03.988
$60.

12:05.960 --> 12:10.347
Now, where was he growing onions?

12:10.407 --> 12:11.088
Near what town?

12:13.832 --> 12:18.559
Near Mellon?

12:18.619 --> 12:20.401
Did he own the land or did he rent it?

12:20.682 --> 12:21.163
He owned it?

12:21.984 --> 12:23.025
When had he bought it?

12:31.859 --> 12:34.903
What is that land used for now?

12:37.972 --> 12:38.673
Is that right?

12:40.514 --> 12:45.899
And how many did he grow onions on the same ground year after year?

12:51.644 --> 12:56.128
Since you've been in agriculture, have you ever grown onions?

13:00.973 --> 13:02.614
Because that was tough work, wasn't it?

13:04.175 --> 13:07.118
Onions made more money per acre than cotton?

13:09.477 --> 13:13.042
Oh, yeah, can't beat that.

13:14.003 --> 13:29.986
Can't beat... My... That's a lot of money in that time.

13:31.047 --> 13:31.548
That's a lot.

13:32.069 --> 13:37.797
All right, then, when you got out of A&M, you first went to work for the 4-H...

13:41.725 --> 13:43.147
How did you get that job?

14:08.286 --> 14:09.268
Did you enjoy it?

14:11.307 --> 14:13.176
Did that take you all over the state?

14:15.508 --> 14:19.427
Who were the people that you remember that were helpful?

14:36.637 --> 14:41.122
Tell me what you did in that capacity.

14:41.142 --> 15:00.383
Did you speak or work with the high school teachers?

15:29.911 --> 15:33.096
What was your, do you remember what your pay was in that first job?

15:33.116 --> 15:40.148
$450 a year?

15:42.292 --> 15:43.313
And you lived where?

15:46.098 --> 15:47.260
On the campus at A&M.

15:48.442 --> 15:50.205
For how long did you live there?

15:55.334 --> 15:56.155
Two or three years.

15:57.080 --> 16:02.029
and traveled by train, you were on the road about half the time?

16:02.089 --> 16:21.163
So you learned from missing that train one time.

16:35.875 --> 16:39.507
I never felt right.

17:03.263 --> 17:08.612
Tell me about what the Depression did to people in Texas.

17:09.594 --> 17:20.732
How bad was it?

17:35.984 --> 17:48.758
What did you do during the Depression?

17:51.021 --> 17:59.550
You continued to work.

17:59.690 --> 18:05.637
Did the Depression affect one part of agriculture more than others?

18:07.608 --> 18:08.109
All of it.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.153
So cattle and cotton and everything.

18:22.329 --> 18:22.750
Let's see.

18:23.631 --> 18:28.759
Let me stop this and let you take a rest now, and I'll come back after lunch.

18:33.966 --> 18:36.670
As World War II approached,

18:37.443 --> 18:41.091
What were you doing in the late 30s, early 40s?

18:45.481 --> 18:54.020
You were still with the extension?

18:54.040 --> 18:54.220
Oh.

19:03.397 --> 19:09.863
Carpet, Cremory, Cremory, Plainfield, all the banks, you know.

19:44.217 --> 19:48.988
It'd be the best of the joy that you could find.

19:53.939 --> 19:55.122
I think you're right in the door.

20:24.987 --> 20:43.350
When did you meet Gus Wortham?

22:48.762 --> 22:59.719
How involved in politics were you in the 1930s?

23:00.801 --> 23:06.450
Did you have to go to Austin often to lobby for agriculture?

23:12.910 --> 23:18.719
So you didn't have to work with W. Lee O'Daniel or Jimmy Allred or?

23:22.064 --> 23:24.168
No, I knew them all.

23:24.368 --> 23:27.333
Describe Governor O'Daniel for me then, please.

23:27.933 --> 23:28.815
You say you knew him.

23:39.692 --> 23:40.453
A wheeler dealer?

23:42.492 --> 23:43.314
Was he honest?

23:45.419 --> 23:45.679
I don't know.

23:45.699 --> 23:48.125
And physically, big, small?

23:53.096 --> 23:54.539
Oh, excuse me.

23:54.559 --> 23:55.000
Go ahead.

25:08.048 --> 25:24.598
Chicken, pork, pork, pork, pork, pork, and steak.

25:24.618 --> 25:24.719
Yeah.

25:24.739 --> 25:25.460
I said, can you bring it to anybody?

25:25.480 --> 25:26.201
I said, can you bring it to anybody?

25:26.221 --> 25:26.943
I said, can you bring it to anybody?

25:26.963 --> 25:27.103
Anyway.

25:44.195 --> 25:51.805
Of the agricultural groups during that time, which one had the greatest political influence?

25:54.609 --> 25:55.530
Was it the cattlemen?

26:02.720 --> 26:06.625
And the Farm Bureau?

26:20.797 --> 26:23.600
Which governors cared most about agriculture?

26:26.464 --> 26:26.704
Conley.

26:26.724 --> 26:26.904
Conley?

26:29.267 --> 26:41.061
Now that causes me to ask, of all the governors you know, which governors made the best appointments, appointed the best people to boards and agencies?

26:41.882 --> 26:42.323
Conley.

26:43.044 --> 26:44.546
That's the answer everybody gives.

26:45.867 --> 26:46.568
Good provided.

26:47.577 --> 27:15.964
I've asked how did he select good people, and two or three folks have said he would tell his staff a long time in advance, I need to appoint members to the whatever it is, bring me a list of all the quality people that I ought to consider, and that then from that list he selected high-quality people.

27:16.838 --> 27:25.694
You were mentioning a while ago when you and Governor Daniel chatted before your A&M appointment.

27:26.515 --> 27:29.140
How did your name come to his attention?

27:30.803 --> 27:32.787
Who proposed you or recommended you?

27:32.867 --> 27:33.328
Do you know?

27:33.368 --> 27:35.792
Who?

27:41.898 --> 27:47.049
And do you know how many others he considered when he considered you?

27:51.919 --> 27:56.228
Did he ask you any other questions except co-education questions?

28:34.008 --> 28:44.192
Did you ever work with Gib Gilchrist?

28:44.212 --> 28:47.460
Tell me about him, please, about Mr. Gilchrist.

29:03.927 --> 29:05.489
Did he do a good job at A&M?

29:09.095 --> 29:26.661
His son Henry told me that when they moved there, that he, the son, didn't like it because after living in Austin, College Station seemed so small, but that his father then bribed him by giving him a new bicycle.

29:27.923 --> 29:43.490
He was 13 years old and he said that almost every faculty member and staff member lived on the campus and that he thought it was a long way from College Station to anywhere else.

29:45.894 --> 29:53.307
He also said that College Station was not yet incorporated so that when

29:55.025 --> 30:14.077
Mr. Bryan, up at the First National Bank in Bryan, planned to annex College Station that his father as dean of engineering and some others on the campus got busy and incorporated College Station.

30:16.341 --> 30:20.728
Did any of you former students help with that?

30:25.855 --> 30:43.821
This boy, brother in the back, the father said, Father, give me a little.

30:43.841 --> 30:44.202
I don't know what.
