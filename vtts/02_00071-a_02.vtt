00:03.280 --> 00:08.820
Was Silver Taps celebrated off of the roof of the 
academic building like it is now? Was Sully's

00:10.880 --> 00:15.680
statue already there when you were a student?

00:18.790 --> 00:24.540
Did you all celebrate Aggie Muster on April 21st? 
Oh,

00:24.880 --> 00:33.960
I agree. I think musters, silver taps, midnight 
yell practice, final review, and commencements,

00:33.940 --> 00:49.510
I think, are some of the key events in building 
Aggie pride.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.405
That's right. I'm going to do the muster this year 
in Nashville, Tennessee. This will be my 25th

01:01.440 --> 01:04.020
muster speech. I'm one of the few people that has 
ever done the muster speech at College Station.

01:10.830 --> 01:15.610
That doesn't have an Aggie degree or wasn't a 
four-star general.

01:20.350 --> 01:29.400
When final review was held then, was it held on the 
place that we call the drill field today? Did

01:29.380 --> 01:36.960
your parents come for graduation and 
commissioning?

01:39.790 --> 01:40.237
Yes, sir. And they came on the train. Do you 
remember anybody who owned... owned a car when you

01:47.020 --> 01:48.840
were a student? Because I presume no student had a 
car.

01:56.870 --> 01:59.470
What was your core outfit's name? B-1. Did you all 
have a nickname?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.890
Yes, sir. Let's see. Was that an infantry outfit? 
Did the cavalrymen play polo then?

02:35.930 --> 02:40.010
Did you... You weren't involved in any of the... 
Athletic teams. You weren't a member of the...

02:45.900 --> 02:49.260
What were your favorite extracurricular 
activities? What did you do for pleasure?

03:01.240 --> 03:05.300
Did you spend much time in the library studying?

03:12.570 --> 03:14.376
Mm-hmm. And I understand that a freshman could not 
be harassed while he was in the library studying.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.740
Now, on Saturday nights, where did you and your 
buddies go to celebrate? Where

03:31.340 --> 03:35.470
you could hide? Did... Did you all go to the rock 
pits, the clay pits? Were those places to swim

03:43.000 --> 03:45.240
then? Later, there would be some gravel pits where 
they swam. Did you all do that?

03:56.260 --> 03:57.272
Oh, okay. Not anymore. But there was then a fish 
tank? And what did you wear when you were swimming

04:02.160 --> 04:06.780
in the fish tank?

04:10.510 --> 04:11.571
Did you wear anything? No. Do you remember 
going... No. Going to Houston ever just for fun?

04:19.340 --> 04:19.584
No.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.101
Football game only. And let's see, did Rice play 
football yet? Who was your favorite opponent in

04:29.460 --> 04:35.330
football? Texas? Still is. Still is. I'd rather be 
Texas U. I

04:42.340 --> 04:47.577
agree. But one of the things that I think is good 
today, that every time Texas achieves something,

04:55.330 --> 04:59.720
we want to outdo them, and vice versa, so we are both 
getting better, trying to be better than each

05:02.800 --> 05:04.900
other, and the people of Texas gain. Are you proud 
to be a Texan? That's right. I agree with you. I

05:14.010 --> 05:14.695
agree. How long has your family lived in Texas?

05:22.370 --> 05:22.991
Alabama.

05:35.350 --> 05:36.851
Ooh, that's a lot.

05:43.630 --> 05:46.070
So he would have come in the 18... 1880s?

05:50.330 --> 05:52.640
Where did he first live in Texas? West Texas. And 
when did your family move to Uvalde?

06:11.730 --> 06:12.551
Oh, I see.

08:50.180 --> 08:50.785
In Europe. In those days, did students take 
Spanish very often? No. Didn't take... What about

08:57.190 --> 08:58.211
German? Did you take German in high school? 
Because I know during World War I, I have read that

09:04.070 --> 09:06.590
we quit teaching German because of... Because of 
the war. I got it. Proper so.

09:30.460 --> 09:31.281
I see.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.330
When you would ride the train to and from College 
Station, you went from College Station to where on

10:37.080 --> 10:42.270
the train? To Houston?

11:11.700 --> 11:12.282
And... All right. Did you go... Did you go to San 
Antonio... Through San Antonio? Yeah.

11:32.580 --> 11:35.280
Now, while you were at A&M, was your father 
ranching or farming? Farming. And his cash crops

11:40.156 --> 11:42.460
were what? Cotton? Onions. Onions. What kind of 
onions then? White? Bermuda onions? How

11:49.560 --> 11:53.390
many acres?

11:58.410 --> 12:02.120
And that helped to pay your way.

12:07.350 --> 12:10.310
The... Now, where was he growing onions? Near what 
town? Near Mellon?

12:18.330 --> 12:20.430
Did he own the land or did he rent it? He owned it? 
When had he bought it?

12:31.530 --> 12:34.710
What's... What is that land used for now?

12:37.970 --> 12:38.691
Is that right? And how many... Did he grow onions on 
the same ground year after year?

12:50.400 --> 12:51.652
Have you... Since you've been in the agriculture, 
have you ever grown onions? Because

12:58.000 --> 13:02.650
that was tough work, wasn't it? Onions made more 
money per acre than cotton?

13:11.800 --> 13:12.255
Oh, yeah. Can't beat that. Can't beat...

13:22.040 --> 13:29.980
My...

13:22.040 --> 13:29.980
That's a lot of money in that time. That's a lot. All 
right. Then when you got out of A&M, you first went

13:34.650 --> 13:37.690
to work for the 4-H.

13:41.370 --> 13:43.190
How did you get that job?

14:08.130 --> 14:09.191
Did you enjoy it? Did that take you all over the 
state? Who were the people that you remember that

14:15.380 --> 14:19.120
were helpful?

14:38.300 --> 14:41.020
Tell me what you did in that capacity. Did you speak 
or work? Did you work with the high school

14:44.140 --> 14:45.681
teachers?

15:29.940 --> 15:30.661
What was your... Do you remember what your pay was 
in that first job?

15:38.740 --> 15:40.141
$450 a year? And you lived where? On the campus at 
A&M. For how long did you live there? Two

15:50.720 --> 15:56.100
or three years. And traveled by train. You were on 
the road about half the time.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.040
So you learned from missing that train one time. 
Now,

16:21.020 --> 17:05.530
tell me about what the Depression did to people in 
Texas. How bad was it?

17:46.750 --> 17:48.630
What did you do during the Depression? You 
continued to work.

17:59.300 --> 18:04.180
Did the Depression affect one part of agriculture 
more than others? All of it. So cattle and cotton

18:08.540 --> 18:11.060
and everything.

18:22.230 --> 18:22.734
Let's see. Let me stop this and let you take a rest 
now, and I'll come back after lunch.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.181
World War... As World War... World War II 
approached, what were you doing in the late 30s,

18:37.200 --> 18:41.180
early 40s?

18:45.020 --> 18:46.541
You were still with the extension.

19:45.160 --> 20:43.260
When

19:45.160 --> 20:43.260
did you meet Gus Wortham?

21:43.980 --> 23:00.340
How

21:43.980 --> 23:00.340
involved in politics were you in the 1930s? Did you 
have to go to Austin often to lobby for

23:03.000 --> 23:06.050
agriculture?

23:12.940 --> 23:16.100
So you didn't have to work with W. Leo Daniel or 
Jimmy Austin? No. No.

23:22.030 --> 23:27.350
If you describe Governor O'Daniel for me then, 
please. You say you knew him.

23:39.640 --> 23:40.261
A wheeler-dealer. Was he honest? And physically, 
big, small...

23:53.940 --> 23:54.502
Oh, excuse me. Go ahead.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.960
Of the agricultural groups during that time, 
which one had the greatest political influence?

25:54.500 --> 25:55.521
Was it the cattlemen? and

25:55.500 --> 26:04.090
the Farm Bureau,

26:20.740 --> 26:23.540
which governors cared most about agriculture?

26:26.320 --> 26:26.822
Conley? Now that causes me to ask, of all the 
governors you know, which governors made the best

26:33.240 --> 26:36.460
appointments, appointed the best people to 
boards and agencies? I believe Conley. That's the

26:42.610 --> 26:44.590
answer everybody gives. I've asked, how did he 
select good people and two or three folks have said

26:53.160 --> 26:56.800
he would tell his staff a long time in advance, I 
need to appoint members to the whatever it is,

27:02.190 --> 27:06.730
bring me a list of all the quality people that I 
ought to consider. And that then from that list, he

27:12.710 --> 27:15.030
selected high quality people. You were 
mentioning a while ago when you and governors, Mr.

27:21.610 --> 27:25.790
Daniel chatted before your A&M appointment. How 
did your name come to his attention? Who proposed

27:31.000 --> 27:33.020
you or recommended you? Do you know? Who?

27:42.220 --> 27:46.120
And do you know how many others he considered when 
he considered you?

27:52.110 --> 27:54.370
Did he ask you any other questions except 
coeducation questions?

28:34.270 --> 28:36.290
Did you ever work with Gib Gilchrist?

28:44.380 --> 28:46.400
Tell me about him, please. Tell me about Mr. 
Gilchrist.

29:03.960 --> 29:09.080
Did he do a good job at A&M?

29:09.060 --> 29:13.460
His son Henry told me that when they moved there, 
that he, the son, didn't like it because after

29:16.100 --> 29:18.480
living in Austin, College Station seemed so 
small, but that his father then bribed him by

29:24.570 --> 29:27.980
giving him a new bicycle. He was 13 years old, and he 
said that almost every faculty member and staff

29:33.840 --> 29:35.660
member lived on the campus, and

29:35.640 --> 29:41.130
that he thought it was a long way from College 
Station to anywhere else. He also said that

29:45.860 --> 29:47.940
College Station was not yet incorporated, so that 
when

29:51.030 --> 29:57.550
Mr. Bryan, up at the First National Bank in Bryan, 
planned to annex College Station, that his

30:04.760 --> 30:07.280
father, as Dean of Engineering, and some others on 
the campus got busy and incorporated College

30:10.880 --> 30:14.230
Station. Did any of you former students help with 
that?
