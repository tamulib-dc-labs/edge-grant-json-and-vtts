1, 2, 3, 4, x, y. That's me. Here I am. 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:30.524 --> 00:33.027
This is October 17, I believe. That's right. And 
sitting in the Engineering Physics Building,

00:34.789 --> 00:46.422
talking with the Dean Emeritus of Engineering, 
Robert H. H? H, as in Henry. Robert H. Page. Bob, to

00:50.186 --> 00:57.274
begin with, to introduce yourself to anyone that 
might listen to this tape or read the

00:57.507 --> 01:01.637
transcription, describe your background before 
you came to A&M. Where did you grow up? What did your

01:02.940 --> 01:03.842
family do? Where did you go to high school and then 
college? Okay. Born in Philadelphia,

01:08.352 --> 01:11.820
Pennsylvania, city of brotherly love. And I was 
fortunate. I went to a high school that was

01:15.443 --> 01:26.820
competitive, Danner, the Central High School, 
one of those prestigious high schools that had

01:15.443 --> 01:26.820
something in common with the Alamo, both 1836. And 
it also is the only high school in the nation that

01:28.703 --> 01:34.011
has degree-granting authority. See, in 1836, 
there weren't too many colleges around. The state

01:37.681 --> 01:40.865
of Pennsylvania kind of referred to it as the 
people's college. They gave them the authority.

01:42.988 --> 01:44.089
They never took it away. But it's not for all 
students. But anyway, I graduated from high

01:46.772 --> 01:48.534
school. I graduated in January 1945. And at that 
time, of course, there was a war going on. And there

01:57.385 --> 01:59.247
were mid-year classes. Like all my other 
17-year-olds, we all enlisted before

01:59.848 --> 02:04.133
graduation. And I was very fortunate that I took 
all these Army general classification tests and

02:04.855 --> 02:14.032
got sent to VMI for their Army Specialized 
Training Reserve Program. Spent one year there,

02:14.793 --> 02:22.628
which was the maximum you could spend, and that was 
equivalent to two years of college I found later.

02:23.165 --> 02:28.592
But anyway, after that I went on active duty and 
traveled all around the USA. Finally went over to

02:28.753 --> 02:36.142
Hawaii where I was chief engineer of an armed 
forces radio service station in Hawaii, station

02:28.753 --> 02:36.142
KRHO. And then we were starting to get discharged 
by then. The war in Europe was over. The war in Japan

02:42.431 --> 02:44.213
was over. And I came back to the USA and tried to get 
into a university. But as everyone will recall,

02:51.025 --> 02:55.750
after World War II, that was very difficult. So I 
kept going west from Philadelphia, ended up at

02:56.651 --> 03:11.586
Ohio University, and in two years finished up my 
bachelor's in mechanical engineering there,

02:56.651 --> 03:11.586
then headed further west to University of 
Illinois and got a master's and Ph.D. So that was

03:12.628 --> 03:15.110
all the academic training. I did a little teaching 
at Illinois. But then I went into industry with

03:17.992 --> 03:26.527
ESSO, now called Exxon, ESSO Research and 
Engineering Company on the East Coast. And while I

03:26.608 --> 03:34.422
was there, I started teaching graduate courses at 
night at Stevens Institute, also on the East Coast

03:26.608 --> 03:34.422
in Hoboken, New Jersey. And then Stevens 
Institute recruited me to come full time. So I left

03:39.558 --> 03:51.506
the private world there and went to Stevens and 
stayed there four years before Rutgers

03:39.558 --> 03:51.506
University recruited me as a department head. 
When was that? New Brunswick, New Jersey. That was

03:54.693 --> 03:56.217
1961. And I served as department head for 
mechanical engineering. It expanded. It became

04:02.900 --> 04:08.166
mechanical and nuclear, mechanical, nuclear, 
and aerospace as things grew. And finally then,

04:08.206 --> 04:15.775
after 15 years of that, I thought I'd do something 
different. So I stepped out of the department

04:16.716 --> 04:19.639
head's job. and was doing some research. I was very 
fortunate. I had a contract from the Air Force

04:22.864 --> 04:28.693
Office of Scientific Research, and they gave them 
all crazy names. This was called a Themis program,

04:28.733 --> 04:37.206
which made Themis, a Greek name, T-H-E-M-I-S.

04:38.418 --> 04:48.108
And that was one of those programs that during the 
70s, certain students didn't like, but

04:38.418 --> 04:48.108
nevertheless, it was a good program. Brought in 
about a million dollars in research. But then, so

04:51.531 --> 05:01.281
things were going well, but then I got a very nice 
letter from Mac Prescott saying that I had been

04:51.531 --> 05:01.281
nominated for the dean's job here, and he 
explained a lot about the dean's job. Now, this is

05:02.001 --> 05:03.082
70... This would have been... 78, 79? 78, yeah, 78. 
Do you have any idea who, how, forwarded your name?

05:15.238 --> 05:17.822
I had no idea, no. I think Mack indicated later that 
there was more than one. But in fact, what I had to do

05:21.106 --> 05:30.278
right away after getting that nice letter was find 
out exactly where Texas A&M University was. What

05:31.709 --> 05:37.257
did you learn about A&M in that research, in that 
inquiry? Oh, well, what I did was I talked to a lot of

05:37.738 --> 05:44.527
people, and actually I only knew one person. I only 
saw him once in a while at ASME, American Society of

05:44.547 --> 05:51.698
Mechanical Engineering, meetings, and that was 
George Thompson. And George Thompson was

05:52.719 --> 05:54.622
well-known. I could chat with him, but I didn't see 
him often enough to get a lot of information. But I

05:58.928 --> 06:10.702
looked in all the usual reference books, talked to 
people at the National Science Foundation, and I

05:58.928 --> 06:10.702
was an officer in the accreditation program so I 
could look up and see how A&M was doing that way. So

06:11.663 --> 06:16.409
the best thing to do was to accept the challenge and 
come down and see what it was all about. So that

06:17.590 --> 06:23.637
turned out to be very nice because I was impressed 
with Mac Prescott right away. describe the search

06:23.954 --> 06:27.020
process as you would call it. The search process. I 
was contacted and then I did a little study, wrote a

06:28.884 --> 06:43.735
letter back and said I'd like to find out more and I 
came down and Mac met me at the airport and Then

06:43.715 --> 06:52.849
there was a group of, there was a search committee 
that I met with and got shown around a lot. Did the

06:53.470 --> 07:02.805
search process, as far as you recall, was it, did it 
end up being a positive? Did it increase your

07:03.065 --> 07:06.651
interest or was the process not well done? Oh, I 
think it was very well done, yeah. I think it was

07:08.951 --> 07:09.832
very well done. They had some good faculty on the 
search team. Most of them aren't here anymore, but

07:13.037 --> 07:18.125
they did a good job. What were your key concerns? 
Well, my key concerns was where was the College of

07:20.349 --> 07:24.795
Engineering going? And I had a little bit of a 
feeling that it was kind of standing still in the

07:25.937 --> 07:35.592
world as it existed at that time, because the... 
Actually the faculty weren't well known outside

07:36.533 --> 07:42.846
the state of Texas and I found that by talking to 
people in other disciplines as well. And that's

07:44.088 --> 07:52.145
not because they didn't visit outside but because 
they weren't publishing or getting any sort of

07:44.088 --> 07:52.145
national reputation that way. So there were some 
but it wasn't by any means even a small. minority

07:57.053 --> 07:58.114
doing that. So I was concerned where they were 
going and what kind of resources were available

07:58.735 --> 08:05.242
and facilities and so forth. And Mac Prescott was 
very honest with me. He pointed out that there were

08:09.387 --> 08:17.777
challenges, that things weren't in as good shape 
as they really should be. The graduate school

08:19.739 --> 08:26.166
operation in engineering was not really growing. 
There was a shortage of space for operations and

08:27.091 --> 08:35.686
that it would be a challenge. Well, actually that 
sort of interested me because I always liked

08:35.726 --> 08:44.121
challenges rather than having them come if it was a 
nice smooth job and I would just take care of

08:35.726 --> 08:44.121
things. So that went well, and after that, we went 
back and thought about it some more, and then got an

08:44.101 --> 08:55.696
invitation to bring my wife down as well, bring 
Lola down, and we looked around again. We checked

08:55.716 --> 09:02.505
some things in town, you know, churches and stores 
and things like that, and it looked good to us. What

09:02.525 --> 09:05.789
was your candid impression of Bryan College 
Station? I thought it was a nice, friendly town.

09:08.823 --> 09:14.343
And, of course, we noticed at that time, we noticed 
that everything closed up early. Nothing stayed

09:14.363 --> 09:17.394
open late at night or anything like that. By late at 
night, I mean after 6 p.m. But then the next thing

09:20.888 --> 09:23.872
was I got a call from Jarvis Miller. Of course, I had 
met Jarvis during my visits, and he made the offer

09:24.733 --> 09:32.522
to me to come down, and I accepted the offer. And 
what was that beginning salary? The beginning

09:34.925 --> 09:39.050
salary was $61,500 per year. What did that seem 
like to you at that time? Actually, I was coming

09:43.906 --> 09:50.757
from my rather well-paid university. Rutgers 
University has always been in the top class, and I

09:50.817 --> 09:55.885
was in what they call a professor two category. So 
it seemed reasonable. It wasn't an increase for me

09:58.188 --> 10:00.252
or anything like that. Did anybody give you any 
directions or advice? set any goals for you as you

10:06.367 --> 10:10.355
first got here? I think a goal that stuck in my mind 
the most, number one, was what Mac Prescott kept

10:11.076 --> 10:21.135
impressing, and that was quality. And every time I 
talked with him, he, quality, quality. And that

10:26.517 --> 10:28.120
was the way I felt about it, too. So that was number 
one. The other goal, when I talked to Jarvis

10:30.564 --> 10:47.511
Miller, the president, from what I had seen, I 
thought a goal was to try to get a better management

10:30.564 --> 10:47.511
operation for the College of Engineering because 
the faculty were answering to two bosses one being

10:47.727 --> 11:13.515
the dean on the academic side and one being a uh... 
experiment station on the other side both bosses

10:47.727 --> 11:13.515
controlled their salaries and so forth so it 
didn't seem to me like the best management so i

10:47.727 --> 11:13.515
talked to jarvis miller about that and he thought 
well that probably could be done but uh... it took

10:47.727 --> 11:13.515
time to get that done now at rutgers You didn't have 
the separate experiment station? We did not have a

11:17.434 --> 11:20.278
separate experiment station like that, no.

11:23.863 --> 11:28.491
In terms of reporting responsibility, you 
reported to Mike Prescott. That's correct. As you

11:31.635 --> 11:38.706
arrived, describe the leadership staff that you 
inherited in engineering. Who were the key

11:39.427 --> 11:40.549
people? Well, actually, the former dean, Dean 
Benson, had moved out of the position, and there

11:40.613 --> 11:51.870
was someone just filling in whose name I don't 
recall. Things had been just sort of kept the doors

11:52.711 --> 11:57.378
open, broach. And there was no associate dean, 
which meant I had to find one quickly. And then the

12:04.509 --> 12:09.777
others in the game then were... not of the caliber I 
would like to see in those positions. What about

12:14.384 --> 12:16.747
office staff? The office staff brought in a new 
secretary for me who didn't have too much

12:16.827 --> 12:22.474
experience. It would have been better if I had 
someone that knew how to play the games and handle

12:22.594 --> 12:29.643
the paperwork, but she worked out all right. There 
was a fairly large office staff and they got the

12:29.724 --> 12:37.013
jobs done. And you all were located They were all 
located in the Zachry building in one office up

12:38.765 --> 12:45.934
there where my office was a room off of that, yes. 
Was that physical space adequate? It wasn't

12:49.218 --> 12:55.106
really, no, and it was sort of what people like to 
call a bullpen. There were no dividers that

12:55.146 --> 13:06.240
separated one from another, so it was just sort of a 
wide open space but not open enough because there

12:55.146 --> 13:06.240
wasn't enough room and they were into each other, 
their desks. How did you and your wife become

13:06.760 --> 13:15.792
acquainted with Texas A&M and Bryan College 
Station and Texas things, Aggie things? Well,

13:16.934 --> 13:19.137
that worked out very well for us. We seemed to 
really enjoy it. And we were often asked the

13:23.102 --> 13:30.072
question, well, was it hard to move from New Jersey 
to Texas? And we said, not difficult at all. But

13:32.054 --> 13:34.398
nobody could move from Texas to New Jersey. They 
had been here a long time. Were there any people

13:36.612 --> 13:45.587
that now in hindsight you realize were very 
helpful, particularly helpful to you as a

13:36.612 --> 13:45.587
newcomer? Oh, well, certainly Glenn Phillips was 
very helpful, and people like John Calhoun I had

13:45.988 --> 14:02.535
known through the American Society for 
Engineering Education, very helpful, but it

13:45.988 --> 14:02.535
seemed like no one gave us any problems, and we were 
We had help from a lot of people when we moved here.

14:06.456 --> 14:09.800
And you began your service on when? I think the 
technical date was August the 1st, 1979. And

14:16.107 --> 14:23.835
describe the College of Engineering. Where was it 
physically? What was where? Well, the college

14:27.946 --> 14:33.573
itself was primarily in the Zachry building. Most 
of the operations were there. But the

14:37.558 --> 14:40.962
complication was with the experiment station. It 
was hard to see where the line was drawn because

14:41.703 --> 14:53.177
most of the faculty, over half of them at that time, 
had appointments for their salary, part of their

14:41.703 --> 14:53.177
salary in the experiment station. Well we had a 
separate civil engineering building and of

14:53.157 --> 14:58.866
course many of the buildings you see today weren't 
even here. But the one I, it was interesting

15:01.169 --> 15:10.744
because when I really got busy and started to study 
the space situation, the space for the academic

15:11.939 --> 15:25.296
operations had decreased over the last four years 
and the space for the T's and TTI operations had

15:11.939 --> 15:25.296
increased so the net effect looked like 
engineering was getting more. But what I had a

15:26.197 --> 15:32.926
strong interest in was to make sure that academic 
was holding up and they were going down. Did you set

15:34.728 --> 15:36.731
any goals for yourself? Well, I did. I wanted to see 
some things improve right away. I didn't know how

15:43.119 --> 15:44.301
long it would take. But quite frankly, the 
computing situation was not up to the standard it

15:44.821 --> 15:57.713
should have been that I had known in other 
universities by inspecting them, accreditation

15:44.821 --> 15:57.713
visits and so forth. So that was one high goal. I 
wanted to see us get some fellowships to support

15:59.875 --> 16:08.203
graduate students, too, so the graduate program 
could roll. and to get more interest in general

16:08.183 --> 16:15.411
from the faculty about graduate studies and 
things of that sort. So those were really my

16:16.252 --> 16:25.302
primary goals and to try then to get A&M College of 
Engineering more on the map so it's more

16:16.252 --> 16:25.302
recognized. As you learned more about the 
programs here, compared to programs elsewhere?

16:35.966 --> 16:42.015
What were the strongest programs here and then at 
the other extreme, which were the least strong?

16:42.716 --> 16:47.204
Well, the strongest, with no question, was the 
civil engineering program. And Donald McDonald

16:48.245 --> 16:51.951
was the department head at the same time. He had 
good faculty. They were very productive. doing a

16:57.155 --> 16:59.138
good job all around. When I reviewed department 
heads during my tenure as dean, I visited every

16:59.258 --> 17:09.211
person in the department in their office. I wanted 
to see how they were doing. I didn't want to drag

17:10.712 --> 17:12.655
them over to my office. And when I visited for his 
review, it was no question that it was a

17:12.815 --> 17:21.887
first-class operation from the department head 
on down. So it was the strongest, no question. I

17:25.083 --> 17:38.061
think it's hard to say who was really the weakest, 
but electrical engineering could have used a lot

17:25.083 --> 17:38.061
more help to get straightened out. I didn't 
realize until later that there were some problems

17:39.143 --> 17:43.108
there. the uh... one time the department head 
hadn't taught a course for I don't know how many

17:44.219 --> 18:00.979
years you know fifteen or twenty years and wasn't 
really into it that way at all and so uh...

17:44.219 --> 18:00.979
petroleum engineering normally well petroleum 
engineering as you know It has a special position

18:01.735 --> 18:10.947
that there are very few petroleum engineering 
departments and they're always rating number one

18:01.735 --> 18:10.947
or number two or something like that. Then you take 
a program like mechanical engineering that might

18:11.007 --> 18:19.559
come in eighteen and it doesn't look good but 
there's two hundred and some out there.

18:20.580 --> 18:24.506
Were there any program vacancies? Was there 
anything that the College of Engineering at A&M

18:24.526 --> 18:30.814
didn't, any program we didn't have that you 
thought we should? Well, that was pretty obvious.

18:32.364 --> 18:37.874
They didn't have anybody really putting emphasis 
on computing at that time. So I decided, and it took

18:39.777 --> 18:47.110
a long time, that we should have a computer science 
department. And that took about four years or so to

18:47.130 --> 18:53.882
get it through the state board and all get 
approval. But that was the main thing. Then the

18:55.988 --> 19:02.906
other thing that worried me, to be quite honest, 
was I thought some of the programs were too large,

18:55.988 --> 19:02.906
including mechanical engineering. When you have 
50 faculty or so and they don't know each other, It

19:08.898 --> 19:29.775
seemed large and I did toy with an idea that maybe 
mechanical should be split and Arrow had a group

19:08.898 --> 19:29.775
interested in mechanics and have those people 
that are doing the mechanic side of it, the

19:08.898 --> 19:29.775
material side of it, make a separate group for 
them, but I never carried that out. But it still

19:29.755 --> 19:35.765
bothered me that the departments were so large I 
could talk to a faculty member and they didn't know

19:29.755 --> 19:35.765
other faculty members. When you arrived, the 
total enrollment in engineering was about what?

19:40.433 --> 19:42.677
Oh, man, I looked up those numbers the other day. 
Compared to now? Compared to now, shall I say. It's

19:47.565 --> 19:50.470
amazing how high they were. When I arrived, it was 
8,070. and in nineteen uh... eighty two eighty

19:56.452 --> 20:17.802
three just before uh... i had four years as dean was 
eleven thousand nine hundred and six now that's

19:56.452 --> 20:17.802
more than we have today and of course we had a much 
smaller faculty and much less space but uh... well

19:56.452 --> 20:17.802
the faculty were overloaded no question about it

20:18.541 --> 20:20.744
And it went up even a little bit that way. So the four 
year change from 78 to just 82 was a 48% increase

20:20.764 --> 20:28.313
without a faculty increase like that. Looking at 
all your years here, compare your impression of

20:29.475 --> 20:39.267
Aggie engineering students to those you had known 
in New Jersey. Well, that's hard to say because

20:40.225 --> 20:45.333
time makes a big difference when you start talking 
about students. And probably most people my age

20:45.493 --> 20:58.232
that have looked at the situation would say in a lot 
of ways today's student is not as well prepared

20:45.493 --> 20:58.232
coming out of high school as they were, say, 10 
years ago or something like that. No, but I'm

20:58.473 --> 21:01.417
meaning when you first got here. Oh, when I first 
got here, yeah.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.169
The Aggies were dedicated. And I talked to an awful 
lot of young men, mainly young men then because we

21:09.807 --> 21:16.543
didn't have many women in the program. but a few 
women too that had been hoping to go to A&M since

21:16.979 --> 21:23.507
they were kids. And they wanted to get the most out 
of it. And I always think that's the best recipe for

21:27.112 --> 21:31.057
success in college. They would try hard while they 
were here. So that impressed me quite a bit. The

21:34.521 --> 21:40.288
students that I had back at Rutgers as a department 
head, they weren't that dedicated. But they were

21:40.989 --> 21:42.531
good students too, yeah. Did you have more coeds up 
there than here? Yeah, because we probably

21:46.036 --> 21:51.906
started pressing it earlier to try to get up to 15% 
or so in female. That was kind of the goal or

21:52.106 --> 21:54.850
objective. And did we have fewer minorities here? 
We had fewer minorities here at first, yeah.

22:04.938 --> 22:06.419
Experiment Station. Who headed the Engineering 
Experiment Station when you arrived? I'm trying

22:11.143 --> 22:13.526
to think of the gentleman's name at first. He was 
just here a very short time. He'd been here

22:15.567 --> 22:16.608
forever. I say forever, but I can't think of his 
name. But shortly after that, Porter. Skip Porter

22:25.476 --> 22:29.039
became head of the Experiment Station. Describe 
relations between the dean and the director. I'd

22:33.473 --> 22:46.529
say they weren't too good because the problem was 
that the experiment station was just interested

22:33.473 --> 22:46.529
in bringing in research that would help the 
experiment station. Their goal was more dollars,

22:46.589 --> 22:53.277
and the dean's was quality in the academic 
program. So the relationship was a problem, and I

22:54.138 --> 23:01.607
know one of the problems was when it came to 
promotion and tenure and things like that. And it

23:02.110 --> 23:10.760
took a while to get that straightened out, but 
finally the chancellor changed also during my

23:02.110 --> 23:10.760
time as dean, and Art Hanson came in. He made it 
quite clear that it was the university's

23:10.800 --> 23:19.090
responsibility, the academic side, to decide on 
things like promotion and tenure. All right.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.917
Let's talk about this, because this is an 
important matter. During your time as dean, who

23:26.459 --> 23:30.784
initiated primarily, who initiated the 
employment of a new person? Was it the Experiment

23:34.924 --> 23:39.309
Station or the College of Engineering? Or both? 
That's a good question. Both. Both, yeah. Do you

23:43.013 --> 23:48.359
remember some that the Experiment Station hired 
that the College of Engineering didn't want? Oh,

23:48.379 --> 23:49.481
they could easily do that. Is that right? Yeah, 
they could easily do that. And did you all hire

23:51.583 --> 23:52.244
some? Because they had people working 100% for 
them. Okay. Were there some faculty members that

23:56.088 --> 23:59.792
they wouldn't support at all? I didn't know that, 
but as I said, when I looked at the records, there

24:00.683 --> 24:10.515
were well over half of the College of Engineering 
faculty that were supported by the Experiment

24:00.683 --> 24:10.515
Station. You said promotions. Sometimes give 
some examples without being specific by name.

24:17.344 --> 24:23.772
Give some examples of some of the awkwardness.

24:25.338 --> 24:55.092
I think there was a difference in the way the 
quality of the individual was measured and when it

24:25.338 --> 24:55.092
came to promotions, when it came to the final step 
after the department head had done his work, I met

24:25.338 --> 24:55.092
with the dean, with me, and with the head of the 
experiment station and also usually the head of

24:25.338 --> 24:55.092
the Texas Transportation Institute and anyone 
else that might be appropriate and we talked about

24:25.338 --> 24:55.092
each individual. But again, it was that the 
academic viewpoint was different than the

24:56.135 --> 25:03.143
others. And it wouldn't matter what an individual 
was doing as far as teaching and encouraging

25:03.423 --> 25:11.332
students and so forth. If he was bringing in lots of 
money from the experiment station, they want to

25:11.352 --> 25:16.177
move that person ahead. So that's where the 
squabbles really came up. And these individuals

25:22.932 --> 25:31.145
were housed quite often in adjoining offices, 
some who were primarily Experiment Station. Oh

25:31.165 --> 25:33.709
yeah, definitely. And so they picked up their mail 
near each other and so forth. Normally, who

25:40.760 --> 25:45.868
initiated a proposal for promotion and rank? That 
would be the department head, but the department

25:46.405 --> 25:50.930
head's salary is half on the experiment. Every 
department head was paid by the experiment

25:50.950 --> 25:53.552
station as well. While you were dean, if the 
department heads had had to make a choice, do you

25:55.835 --> 26:14.134
think they would have voted pro-college or pro- 
That would be a real guess, but I know that the

26:15.667 --> 26:21.235
Experiment Station could, since they had 
something to say about the salary, they could make

26:15.667 --> 26:21.235
salary increases for the department head. The 
department heads knew that without going to the

26:21.275 --> 26:24.719
dean. And there were a few also who were 
engineering extension service. Oh, yes. Very

26:31.709 --> 26:32.169
few. Now, that was Jim Bradley? That's right. 
Describe working with Jim.

26:39.599 --> 26:40.340
No problem. No problem with Jim? No. And Charlie 
Wooten, no problem. Because I have coffee with Jim

26:45.704 --> 26:52.441
every other Saturday or so at Shipley, so I see him. 
Interviewed Charlie Wooten not long ago. Let's

26:55.048 --> 26:58.357
see, he's got a health problem right now. Oh, he 
does? I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. What is it?

27:01.787 --> 27:04.912
Because I believe he's getting ready to go through 
radiation.

27:06.776 --> 27:10.703
He looked thinner than I had remembered. Let's 
talk about this matter then in theory. If you could

27:15.291 --> 27:26.410
have created the organizational structure, how 
do you think A&M then could have best been

27:15.291 --> 27:26.410
organized in engineering? Well, if I had anything 
to say about the organizational structure, which

27:26.440 --> 27:39.522
I talked to Jarvis Miller about and Mac Prescott, 
it's obvious that there has to be a dean that's in

27:26.440 --> 27:39.522
charge of both research and teaching and any other 
ideas closely related to that because my theory

27:39.957 --> 28:04.092
always has been and it's usually worked is that the 
best teachers are scholars or researchers that

27:39.957 --> 28:04.092
love to teach but just being scholars or 
researchers is not enough and just loving to teach

27:39.957 --> 28:04.092
is not enough either it's got to be that 
combination. Is that normally the pattern at

28:04.527 --> 28:08.612
other land-grant schools that you know of? Oh, I 
think so, yeah. In fact, a lot of people thought it

28:11.576 --> 28:20.287
was very strange when they heard of the system that 
we had here where we had two bosses. And so many

28:20.487 --> 28:25.073
faculty members said to me personally, they said, 
this is a strange system. I have two people I have to

28:25.113 --> 28:28.878
report to.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.442
I know that during... the year that you and I served 
together, I know that that was one of the pulls and

28:32.827 --> 28:41.319
tugs in engineering and agriculture. Were you 
aware, as we got into 1980, were you aware that

28:42.901 --> 28:57.821
there was approaching a crisis where Jarvis was 
advocating the structure that you wanted? Were

28:57.901 --> 29:00.505
you aware that there was a crisis coming? No, I 
would not. None at all. In fact, I was, I think, out

29:02.648 --> 29:15.155
of town in June of 80 when the secretary, my 
secretary called me and said, I want you to be

29:02.648 --> 29:15.155
informed that Jarvis Miller is being reassigned.

29:17.460 --> 29:18.342
How did she learn? I don't know. Did someone call 
her? I don't know. I heard a story once which might

29:21.679 --> 29:23.682
be true. In fact, you might have even told me this, 
that things are being confidential at A&M means

29:23.702 --> 29:31.774
you only tell one person at a time. There you go. I 
learned about it the night that we arrived in El

29:38.163 --> 29:43.030
Paso to begin my new task. Mac had called the... 
motel where we were spending the night, but I

29:46.823 --> 29:52.176
didn't get the message till 10.30 mountain time. 
So I didn't, I was going to wait till the next

29:52.937 --> 30:01.778
morning, because it would have been 11.30 here, 
and by 7 o'clock mountain time, three reporters

29:52.937 --> 30:01.778
had called me. to ask for comments.

30:07.867 --> 30:19.468
During this first year with Prescott and Jarvis, 
can you give some examples of their positive

30:07.867 --> 30:19.468
support and encouragement? Oh, well, I always 
felt that Mack thought that was the way to go. Mac

30:25.619 --> 30:30.107
Prescott, and Jarvis seemed to go along with it. In 
fact, I was very optimistic that Jarvis was going

30:31.730 --> 30:38.904
to make sure that got done. Did you and the other 
deans talk about this much? Not too much because

30:45.970 --> 30:48.094
they didn't have that problem. Agriculture 
didn't have it as much as engineering? Well they

30:51.981 --> 30:55.046
didn't indicate that it was a problem. I knew 
faculty in agriculture but they seemed to be happy

30:55.206 --> 31:00.115
with their situation. During the years that you 
were a dean With which other deans did you have the

31:02.980 --> 31:06.725
closest relationship? Probably business. 
Business? Yeah, because we had common problems.

31:10.529 --> 31:12.291
We couldn't hire the faculty we want. We didn't 
have the dollars we needed to hire. Who was the

31:14.634 --> 31:16.076
business dean then? Bill Mews. Bill, who's now 
president at Auburn. Right. And deans met

31:22.864 --> 31:26.068
normally well we had that uh... APC yeah the 
academic council or whatever it was called yeah

31:26.318 --> 31:41.695
academic program in the coke building yeah on 
monday uh monday right describe those meetings as

31:26.318 --> 31:41.695
you recall them oh they were very good meetings i i 
uh You must have sat in on him. Mac Prescott ran

31:44.279 --> 31:45.600
them. I thought he did a good job. He gave everybody 
a chance to talk that had anything to say. In fact,

31:50.287 --> 31:55.454
his standard operating procedure was to go around 
the table and ask everybody by name. He'd come to

31:55.614 --> 31:57.757
me, Bob, do you have anything to say? And go right on 
around. So I thought it worked very well, that

31:59.700 --> 32:02.183
system. I was sorry to see it go when they changed 
the whole system. How did, when Jarvis was

32:06.785 --> 32:17.045
reassigned and Chuck Sampson became the interim 
president, what did that mean for engineering?

32:19.730 --> 32:20.671
Did anything change? No. I think Chuck Sampson was 
just minding the store. And he knew all the

32:25.465 --> 32:31.234
department heads well for being here a long time. 
And I was told that he wanted to be dean. He reminded

32:36.141 --> 32:40.187
me he wasn't too happy about me being dean, but he 
was just minding his store. All right, then Frank

32:40.307 --> 32:44.033
Vandiver came after him. That's right. So I had 
three presidents in four years and two

32:45.615 --> 32:49.060
chancellors.

32:51.993 --> 32:55.358
Describe Vandiver's relationship with the Dean 
of Engineering. Well, Vandiver was, from the

32:55.458 --> 32:59.363
minute he came, was very open. I immediately 
invited him to come over and talk to the faculty,

32:59.483 --> 33:02.828
which he did. And he was willing to talk to me about 
anything. He was not going to fool around too much

33:08.175 --> 33:14.203
with the high-level politics, he said. But I did 
point out the problems we had. He agreed with me

33:17.656 --> 33:25.586
right from the start that we should get this 
organization straightened out. In fact, he wrote

33:25.606 --> 33:31.914
a nice letter to the faculty at the time that we were 
going to finally get it straightened out. At that

33:32.094 --> 33:39.043
time, he called in all the TTI, Tease, myself, I'm 
trying to think who else was there, but into his

33:40.171 --> 34:07.106
office and said that he now saw that we should have a 
different organization for engineering and that

33:40.171 --> 34:07.106
probably the best way to carry it out was to start 
looking for a new super dean was the term he used and

33:40.171 --> 34:07.106
that was kicked around a lot in the media. It was 
dropped after a while. But that was one way of

34:09.770 --> 34:11.352
describing it. But then he wrote a nice letter to 
the faculty, and I said, well, we've got to have a

34:11.412 --> 34:15.977
faculty meeting right away. The faculty know, and 
he agreed to come to the faculty meeting, and then

34:16.017 --> 34:23.584
the provost agreed. At that time, we had a provost. 
We no longer had a vice president for academic

34:25.006 --> 34:27.248
affairs. The provost agreed to come as well. Was 
McDonald, by that time, was he the... Chief

34:34.964 --> 34:37.968
academic officer or was that Mack Prescott? Mack 
Prescott.

34:42.014 --> 34:44.337
But I'm trying to think, what was the timing on 
that? I know Eaton had taken over as provost

34:44.357 --> 34:49.083
before. In fact, Mack decided that it was time to, 
with all these presidents changing, to move out.

34:56.362 --> 35:00.326
Now, you mentioned Chancellor Hanson. Yeah. He 
was an engineer. Right. Did you know him before he

35:03.649 --> 35:05.571
came here? Yes, I did. I didn't know him very well, 
but I knew of him. I had one of his books. He wrote an

35:09.574 --> 35:11.116
engineering book. He's probably still sitting 
over there. And, of course, I talked to him about

35:13.218 --> 35:19.364
the situation also, and he said he couldn't 
understand why it was organized that way. That's

35:19.384 --> 35:21.766
when he's sitting in the chancellor's seat. He 
said... I told, I guess he said I told Frank

35:23.007 --> 35:33.085
Vanderveer, these are not the exact words, but the 
idea that I'm amazed he could hire a dean under that

35:23.007 --> 35:33.085
situation. that it had to be direct control. It 
couldn't be having one person serve two masters

35:36.110 --> 35:40.516
all the time with different objectives. All 
right. Did they move then to make the change? Yes,

35:42.959 --> 35:43.460
they did. That helped it along. I think then after 
Art Hanson had talked to me about that, I think then

35:44.942 --> 35:50.149
he must have talked to Frank. That's because the 
time schedule seemed to be such that then Frank

35:50.169 --> 35:55.075
called the meeting and we went ahead. And so that 
change came in... In the summer of 83, you know.

36:04.250 --> 36:06.873
Okay. During your period of service, describe 
what you are most proud of having accomplished.

36:13.702 --> 36:15.244
Oh, boy. Well, there was an awful lot, actually. 
What I was most proud of... I think I was proud that

36:21.372 --> 36:24.556
we got industry involved. We started and we had 
industrial advisory committees for every

36:24.576 --> 36:28.941
department. And I finally totaled them up once. I 
think I had the number over here somewhere to how

36:32.649 --> 36:37.986
many we had.

36:38.725 --> 37:05.273
it was rather impressive we had uh... two hundred 
seventy three people from industry serving

36:38.725 --> 37:05.273
directly on departmental advisories committee 
so we had that kind of interaction at first people

36:38.725 --> 37:05.273
said well you can't do that there's no industry in 
college station and brian i said well i wasn't

36:38.725 --> 37:05.273
thinking of college station and brian it's a big 
state so uh... we had i was proud of uh... that fact

36:38.725 --> 37:05.273
that we got uh... got those involved and then also 
uh... another thing that uh... it turned out very

37:06.012 --> 37:35.749
well the college of engineering should have some 
sort of honors that they bestow on alumni of course

37:06.012 --> 37:35.749
the alumni association uh... former students 
were doing that but at a lower level so i initiated

37:06.012 --> 37:35.749
that where the faculty could make 
recommendations and we'd pick three or four maybe

37:06.012 --> 37:35.749
five each year and bring them in that turned out 
very well because for so many of them uh... they

37:36.657 --> 38:04.437
were extremely good and we gave them the notoriety 
and publicity they moved up one up the line to key

37:36.657 --> 38:04.437
positions

37:36.657 --> 38:04.437
that has kept running very well over the years so 
that was good to get that external

37:36.657 --> 38:04.437
impact that way and all those people that came in 
actually we honored them but they continued to do a

37:36.657 --> 38:04.437
lot for us worked out very well. Sounds like a good 
investment. Yeah, I think so. And then I was proud

38:10.109 --> 38:16.416
of the fact that we really finally got the computer 
situation improved tremendously. How'd you do

38:16.476 --> 38:17.837
that? Well, it took time. When I first came here 
there were some requests coming through and

38:19.720 --> 38:32.314
somebody asked me for my opinion of it and they were 
buying a lot of card program calculators And these

38:32.615 --> 38:35.926
were things that punched the holes. And it was a 
real bargain. You could get them from IBM very

38:38.615 --> 38:40.180
cheap. But I said, no, that mode is changing. And 
there was a big fuss about that. Actually, Jarvis

38:48.036 --> 38:51.640
Miller was concerned about computing. I wrote him 
a couple of reports on that. We finally got an

38:56.506 --> 39:06.698
up-to-date computer through some donations from 
Pat Zachary and other sources and got it right in

38:56.506 --> 39:06.698
the Zachary building. There was another computer 
on campus that people weren't too happy with. I

39:15.376 --> 39:25.841
think T's was controlling that, but the new 
computer was located in the Zachry building and

39:15.376 --> 39:25.841
faculty had access to it right away. So that was 
just a step that got us moving that way, and then

39:25.941 --> 39:33.739
people started getting personal computers on 
their desks and things like that. It was

39:35.491 --> 39:43.342
interesting, the first personal computer that 
was purchased, I bought in the dean's office. And

39:43.362 --> 39:48.510
that was a job, to get it through the purchasing 
here and over at the state. Why would anybody want a

39:48.790 --> 39:52.255
computer that sits on their desk? They thought of 
them as big monsters somewhere. But anyway,

39:56.061 --> 39:59.085
somebody had to break the ice there, I guess. Do you 
have any idea what the investment cost was of that

39:59.251 --> 40:01.994
one? Yeah, I do. It was very low power compared to 
anything we had now, and it was about $6,000. Let's

40:07.919 --> 40:12.904
see. Did you make some appointments that you now 
think in hindsight were key appointments?

40:19.931 --> 40:26.777
Some new faculty, some new... Well, I had to get an 
associate dean. And so we went out and searched

40:27.668 --> 40:30.712
there. We brought in a couple people. And one of 
them was a person I had hired once before. When I was

40:36.640 --> 40:40.305
at Rutgers as a department head, I had hired L.S. 
Fletcher, Skip Fletcher. But he had left Rutgers

40:44.070 --> 40:49.457
and gone to University of Virginia as department 
head. He was well qualified for that position. So

40:52.531 --> 40:59.259
he was one of the ones and we looked them all over and 
the offer was made to Skip Fletcher and that turned

40:52.531 --> 40:59.259
out very well. He was a very good man. And 
department heads? He was an associate? No, no, no.

41:07.369 --> 41:08.891
Oh, as department heads? Well, there wasn't, 
unfortunately, there wasn't much turnover in

41:08.911 --> 41:15.158
department heads.

41:16.555 --> 41:18.660
during my period of time there. As an 
administrator, if you could have it operated the

41:18.941 --> 41:27.420
way you wanted it, what would be the key role of a 
department head? What would be their major task?

41:31.287 --> 41:33.690
Well, that's a good question. It's hard to say what 
the key role is, but I always thought the

41:33.750 --> 41:42.299
department had the interface between the faculty 
and the dean, obviously. So the department head

41:42.980 --> 42:00.720
should let the dean know where things are standing 
as far as the teaching load on the faculty, the

41:42.980 --> 42:00.720
instrumentation that's needed, the facilities, 
and so forth, and have that all worked out in some

41:42.980 --> 42:00.720
detail and bring it forth to the dean. Do you think 
the department head should feel automatically

42:00.700 --> 42:07.714
bound by a majority vote of the department? No, I 
don't think he could progress then. He or she, I

42:10.440 --> 42:12.364
should say, nowadays.

42:14.929 --> 42:16.131
And how long should they serve? Well, that's hard 
to say. Every school's got different ideas on how

42:20.242 --> 42:22.545
long they should term. But the more I think about 
it, that's one reason I stopped being a department

42:22.565 --> 42:26.511
head. I thought three five-year terms was long 
enough. And

42:29.896 --> 42:37.708
I would say something like that maybe no longer 
than fifteen years or ten years. Also, you're

42:38.670 --> 42:43.557
saying a term and they're reviewed every so many 
years. That's right. There should be a review,

42:44.118 --> 42:45.820
definitely. Everybody should be reviewed. Did, 
while you were dean, did y'all have any kind of

42:48.372 --> 42:58.632
highly publicized problems with tenure, 
promotion, termination?

43:01.136 --> 43:03.341
No, we didn't have any big ones like that. No 
lawsuits? No lawsuits, no. There was one where a

43:07.053 --> 43:14.822
person falsified information about previous 
degrees and things of that sort. That was on our

43:14.842 --> 43:16.284
faculty already. But that was so clear cut that in 
any court, if you give false information on your

43:17.526 --> 43:24.875
application to begin with of that sort. Did that 
person's employment terminate? That's right.

43:30.762 --> 43:33.425
Let me... In terms of... exterior funding and so 
forth, were there some key accomplishments in

43:35.453 --> 43:47.363
engineering during your years as dean that you're 
proud to look back on? Well, there were two.

43:51.130 --> 44:21.087
is that uh... when i studied faculty salaries 
uh... after i came here and got all that detailed

43:51.130 --> 44:21.087
data compared it to average faculty salaries 
which i could get from several sources uh... both

43:51.130 --> 44:21.087
nationally and in this uh... region in the 
southwest region uh... we were way behind

43:51.130 --> 44:21.087
that meant that i went through the right channels 
to the uh... board of regents and asked for funds

43:51.130 --> 44:21.087
for that it didn't go over too well So I thought 
about that a little bit more, and I talked to Bill

44:21.522 --> 44:25.808
Mews, and then the two of us went. He was having the 
same problem. He had made some studies. He had data

44:28.472 --> 44:32.417
graphs just like I did where we could make our point 
clearly. The data was there. And then it was

44:34.200 --> 44:43.192
decided that there would be a special mid-year 
salary increase with some funds given to both

44:34.200 --> 44:43.192
deans. And, of course, we'd have to make the 
allocations and so forth. Well, I thought that was

44:47.408 --> 45:09.437
very important because it was very good for morale 
to bring the faculty up and since there were no

44:47.408 --> 45:09.437
special rules tied to that, somebody that was 
really productive and for some reason hadn't been

44:47.408 --> 45:09.437
acknowledged, he might end up with a ten percent or 
twelve percent increase and others got one or two

44:47.408 --> 45:09.437
percent, something like that. You know, the usual 
mirth sort of thing. So that was, I thought that was

45:12.001 --> 45:15.205
very important. and a major step forward. In those 
years, which similar programs in engineering

45:17.991 --> 45:27.129
were you watching most closely as your 
comparators? You mean in other universities?

45:33.477 --> 45:43.670
Probably University of Illinois because I had so 
many friends there that they could give me

45:33.477 --> 45:43.670
detailed data on things that are hard to get 
otherwise unless you have extremely good

45:33.477 --> 45:43.670
contacts. But there were others and we started 
actually in sort of the Southwest Conference to

45:43.730 --> 45:50.398
circulate some information. I started that on 
teaching loads and faculty and things of that

45:50.418 --> 45:54.523
sort. But the other point that I made, which I was 
very proud of, and you can almost look out the

45:55.415 --> 46:13.097
windows and see, and you're sitting in one of them, 
is that I got the data on square feet per faculty

45:55.415 --> 46:13.097
member from other universities and made charts on 
that, and we were way beyond. We just needed more

46:13.417 --> 46:14.759
space. And our space, as I mentioned earlier to 
you, had decreased. over the last four or five

46:20.153 --> 46:28.365
years because it was taken over by external 
operations, the T's and TTI and so forth. So I had

46:28.385 --> 46:42.325
that data and I went in and talked to the Board of 
Regents about that and some of them didn't like it

46:28.385 --> 46:42.325
because they said they thought everything was 
great when the Zachry Building was completed.

46:42.365 --> 46:45.570
They had been told that that would solve 
everything for engineering. And I pointed out

46:45.922 --> 46:51.654
that when the Zachry building was completed, 
there were like 3,500 total students. We have

46:52.156 --> 46:54.200
three times that right now. So, of course, that 
wasn't too good either because they don't always

46:55.042 --> 47:01.095
like to be corrected on something like that.
