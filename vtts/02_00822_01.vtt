04:07.064 --> 04:13.752
As I understand it, it was your great-grandfather 
that founded Bryan and gave land for it to be

04:07.064 --> 04:13.752
settled upon? That's right, yes. Once

04:16.835 --> 04:36.278
upon a time, there was a man named Moses Austin who 
lived in Missouri and had an idea of colonizing

04:16.835 --> 04:36.278
Texas. which was a wilderness at that time, and a 
part of Mexico, a province of Mexico.

04:49.044 --> 04:58.218
Before Moses Austin could realize his dream of the 
colonization of Texas, he died. He had a son named

04:59.921 --> 05:02.805
Stephen F. Austin, who later became known as the 
father of Texas. Stephen F. Austin went to Mexico

05:09.217 --> 05:31.138
and prevailed on the Mexican government to 
appoint him as the impresario to

05:09.217 --> 05:31.138
colonize Texas and to fulfill, therefore, his 
father's dream. So Austin then came back to Texas,

05:33.532 --> 05:54.420
even after he spent some time in jail in Mexico, 
prompted by this wild dream of his, so to speak,

05:33.532 --> 05:54.420
came back to Texas and went about the business of 
colonizing the state or the area.

05:57.884 --> 06:00.568
His sister, Emily Austin, had married a fellow 
named James Bryan, and they had three sons,

06:01.612 --> 06:16.934
William Joel Bryan, Moses Austin Bryan, and Guy M. 
Bryan. Well, each of these nephews of Stephen F.

06:19.417 --> 06:30.994
Austin came into consideration for some land. The 
particular land that we're sitting on here today

06:32.797 --> 06:46.577
called Bryan, Texas, was given to William Joel 
Bryan, who is my great-grandfather,

06:32.797 --> 06:46.577
incidentally.

06:49.341 --> 06:57.252
And he then set up a township and named it after 
himself, Bryan, Texas. There was a community at

06:58.936 --> 07:21.233
Boonville, which is a few miles to the east of us, 
inhabited by a few citizens, and he moved them over

06:58.936 --> 07:21.233
here and laid out the town and prevailed on the 
railroad to come on down from Marlin, I believe.

07:21.314 --> 07:23.998
Marlin, Texas was as far as it came at the time. 
prevailed on the railroad to bring its tracks on

07:25.008 --> 07:30.635
down to Bryan. And incidentally, he rode the cow 
catcher on the engine into town on the first trip by

07:30.655 --> 07:40.928
the railroad into Bryan.

07:45.594 --> 07:54.525
He

07:45.594 --> 07:54.525
named Bryan as the county seat for the county of 
Brazos. And he sold the land up where the

07:55.940 --> 08:04.270
courthouse is today to the county for $1.

08:07.653 --> 08:12.859
In his efforts to get the railroad to come through 
town, he gave the land for that. He sold the

08:14.161 --> 08:20.729
railroad, the property, the right of way for $1 for 
the tracks to go on. And he did all in his power to

08:28.593 --> 08:35.620
organized a town which he did and today is named 
Bryan, Texas.

08:41.306 --> 08:54.820
That's really it in a nutshell is how it all 
happened and I

08:41.306 --> 08:54.820
think that

08:57.230 --> 09:14.732
the A&M University

08:57.230 --> 09:14.732
was organized by the state of Texas when his 
brother, Guy Bryan, was Speaker of the House of

08:57.230 --> 09:14.732
Representatives of the state. So I

09:17.095 --> 09:25.566
realized that with all this and 15 cents, I can get a 
cup of coffee. I am very proud of the effect on this

09:26.255 --> 09:33.064
area that my relatives had. I don't know what else 
you might want to know about it, but that, as I said a

09:33.224 --> 09:43.137
moment ago, is it in a nutshell, Mr. Lippincott. 
Well, has there been any disasters or anything

09:43.738 --> 09:56.194
since you've been here, like yellow fever in 1867 
or something like that, epidemics? No, I don't

09:57.052 --> 10:01.416
know of any epidemics or any disasters other than 
the weather. We've had a tornado or two. I don't

10:03.778 --> 10:12.385
think there's been any kind of disaster in this 
area, to my knowledge. It's been a real good place

10:12.405 --> 10:16.229
to live. It's a good place to rear a family. It's 
known as a city of churches and schools. We have a

10:23.655 --> 10:26.097
fine school system. every kind of religious 
denomination you can think of here.

10:35.000 --> 10:46.429
The fact that the greatest university in the land, 
Texas A&M is next door is quite attractive to

10:35.000 --> 10:46.429
people living in this area. It offers advantages 
that other communities do not have.

10:53.715 --> 10:56.978
Incidentally,

10:57.953 --> 11:06.583
Bryan College Station today is the fastest 
growing city in Texas. And Texas A&M University is

11:06.603 --> 11:11.249
the fastest growing university in the nation. So 
the little thing started by the Bryans many years

11:12.590 --> 11:26.627
ago has grown to a burgeoning community and one 
that we can all be proud of. and that uh one that

11:27.653 --> 11:45.865
seems to be destined

11:27.653 --> 11:45.865
for tremendous success in the future that's

11:27.653 --> 11:45.865
it thank you very much
