WEBVTT

00:01.128 --> 00:03.770
to people in the front seat heading out to the 
airport? I got to the airport. And the first thing I

00:07.573 --> 00:17.022
better do is make sure that the people at the 
airport had confirmed my tickets, my change of

00:07.573 --> 00:17.022
flight. And so I got in that line. And the Chinese 
are not too good about fast, friendly service. So I

00:27.230 --> 00:30.493
must have waited in that line for about an hour. 
There was one man and his wife from our U.S. State

00:30.642 --> 00:36.228
Department who were out there. The wife's mother 
had been visiting in Beijing and was supposed to

00:36.729 --> 00:44.978
stay on longer, but had decided with what had 
happened, she wanted to go back home. And I

00:45.559 --> 00:47.121
couldn't believe this husband and wife. They were 
telling me, oh, you know, it's mother-in-law.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.106
She's just, you know, blowing this all out of 
proportion. And, you know, nothing really

00:52.166 --> 00:54.469
serious has happened here. And I thought, this is 
our State Department.

01:00.038 --> 01:01.340
I was able to confirm my flights. They had me down 
for the next morning or the next day. I looked at the

01:04.284 --> 01:10.254
board of other options of flights to see if there 
was anything else that was going down. And about

01:11.155 --> 01:17.745
the only option that I had was a flight that was 
leaving that evening, going to Tehran. And of

01:18.706 --> 01:21.871
course, Ayatollah Khomeini had just died 
recently, too. So I figured that was probably the

01:21.951 --> 01:28.341
place I'd rather be better off in Beijing than I 
would be in Tehran. So there really weren't any

01:28.861 --> 01:32.145
other options. I found United Airlines. They got a 
little office that's downstairs in the basement.

01:38.373 --> 01:40.716
Because they only fly in a couple of times a week. 
It's not staffed all the time. Which airline was

01:43.219 --> 01:44.400
it? It was United Airlines. That's what the kids 
were going to fly out on. They were going to come

01:49.927 --> 01:51.829
into Beijing on. And I had flown in on. We were going 
to fly from Hong Kong to Tokyo and back to the US on

01:53.231 --> 01:57.957
them. There was a janitor down there, fortunately 
he spoke a little bit of English, and there was a

01:59.135 --> 02:12.691
sign on the board saying that the flight had been 
delayed, and it wasn't going to get in until

01:59.135 --> 02:12.691
Tuesday morning. The flight your kids were 
supposed to be on? They were supposed to be on,

02:15.034 --> 02:17.337
right. He couldn't add anything else to that, and I 
thought, well, if it's open early enough in the

02:17.377 --> 02:24.225
morning, I'll check and see if that's possible. It 
turned out that flight ended up being canceled,

02:24.245 --> 02:28.450
and they were going to come in. I had my bags, I went 
up,

02:28.953 --> 02:41.328
and there were, I guess, about 200 of us who had done 
the same thing as I had. So, it's a pretty big

02:41.348 --> 02:44.833
airport, so it really wasn't very crowded. How 
big? Can you give us an idea of size? As big as one of

02:47.736 --> 02:49.498
the terminals? It's about the size of one of the 
terminals at Houston and Continental.

02:56.965 --> 03:09.041
on not the different corridors that go out to the 
planes, just one level of where you check in and

02:56.965 --> 03:09.041
your bags are.

03:11.004 --> 03:20.977
And one Chinese student who was going over to 
Germany came over and started a conversation with

03:11.004 --> 03:20.977
me. And he was from Shanghai and was trying to get 
out before everything completely fell apart. But

03:31.557 --> 03:33.120
mostly kept to myself. Everybody had some food 
that they had bought at various types of events, so

03:33.160 --> 03:48.624
I ate a little bit and ended up sleeping on top of a 
desk where you go into for the customs inspection.

03:49.165 --> 03:54.073
I was still, I had, after I had checked and made sure 
that My tickets were okay. There is a hotel that

03:57.817 --> 04:00.702
they had built that was out right near the airport. 
There were still cabs coming in at the airport, so I

04:02.365 --> 04:16.087
went out and got one of the cabs there to take me to 
this hotel to see if they had a room for the night,

04:02.365 --> 04:16.087
because I figured, of course, the worst, I could 
walk the next morning, because it was maybe half a

04:02.365 --> 04:16.087
mile, three-quarters of a mile. They took me 
there. That hotel was all full. And they suggested

04:21.087 --> 04:22.809
I go into Toledo. And I said, no, I don't want to go in 
any closer to town. So there was a cab that was there

04:27.555 --> 04:33.002
going back to the airport. It already had three 
Chinese in it. And so the trunk was pretty well

04:35.906 --> 04:39.691
filled. But the guy, for a reasonable price, was 
willing to take me there. And he did. He got me back

04:46.479 --> 04:48.862
to the airport. I spent the night at the airport. 
The next morning, some more people started

04:50.737 --> 04:57.446
arriving because there were two flights that I was 
on, and then there were some flights later on that

04:50.737 --> 04:57.446
were leaving. I was concerned about them perhaps 
closing down the airport, but they didn't.

05:08.200 --> 05:12.645
Getting on an airplane is not an only thing in 
China. One of the things that I was concerned about

05:13.166 --> 05:20.035
were the customs people and going through customs 
because I had a roll of film that I'd taken out of my

05:20.740 --> 05:31.814
camera, the one that I'd taken the pictures the 
night before, and I was concerned if I got caught

05:20.740 --> 05:31.814
with those on me that that could create some 
problems. But I had mixed it in with the other

05:31.954 --> 05:36.259
touristy roles that I'd taken. Of course, in 
China, whether you're innocent or guilty, it

05:36.299 --> 05:41.766
doesn't make a difference. If the government 
wants to get you, they'll just make up anything

05:41.786 --> 05:45.631
that they want to. It's not proving innocence or 
guilt. But I had put that in there. And as it turned

05:52.352 --> 05:55.816
out, the customs people never showed up. Or if they 
did, they came later on in the day. But first of all,

05:58.278 --> 06:01.041
you have to go through this line. And the customs 
people are supposed to look at your bags. Well,

06:04.906 --> 06:05.627
they weren't there. So we just went on through 
there. And then you've got to show your tickets to

06:07.489 --> 06:15.097
the people and check your bags. But you also have to 
get this little stamp I said, departure tax stamp,

06:19.465 --> 06:22.368
separate. There's a separate little booth that 
you've got to go to. Well, I didn't know which one

06:25.210 --> 06:27.672
you had to go to first. So I got in line for the booth 
thing, and the people were taking a lot. It seemed

06:33.357 --> 06:36.780
like they should have already been there, because 
they were already checking some people in. But I

06:38.662 --> 06:41.584
went with this one guy. He said, you know, if you'll 
give me the money, I'll get the tax point, the stamp

06:41.604 --> 06:45.828
point. You can go ahead and get in line. So I said, 
well. you know, I'll do that. It wasn't all that

06:49.085 --> 06:50.067
much money. And he got it for me and gave it to me. And 
I had to go, because there were two flights, I had to

06:52.450 --> 07:01.365
go around behind where this booth was and get in 
this other line that was packed with people. And

07:02.687 --> 07:08.817
there were all kinds of people who didn't have 
tickets who were trying to get on this plane and

07:02.687 --> 07:08.817
that. And they don't really have the concept of a 
line. You wait, you turn the line. You just It's

07:15.220 --> 07:20.507
everybody for himself, and you've got to just 
jockey for position and protect your own

07:15.220 --> 07:20.507
position. Well, I finally got up to the front, and I 
showed them my tickets, and they accepted them,

07:20.527 --> 07:35.045
and they sent my, well, the belt that they have 
there to take the bags down to the basement where

07:20.527 --> 07:35.045
they load the things, it broke down. It wasn't 
working, so people were just literally climbing

07:35.085 --> 07:44.316
up on their stack of their bags on this belt, trying 
to get theirs up closer to the front so that it would

07:35.085 --> 07:44.316
go down, I kept my carry on my handbag with me that 
had the porn stuff in it and went ahead and went out

07:44.971 --> 07:55.546
to the waiting area. And the pilot showed up. We got 
on the plane. We left. It took us about 20 minutes to

08:04.498 --> 08:06.501
get to Tangier. I was concerned there because this 
was another chance for them to decide This was

08:13.878 --> 08:17.643
getting later in the morning, getting around 
noon, you know, that they were going to shut

08:13.878 --> 08:17.643
everything down. We got off the plane. We were 
supposed to be there for an hour. When we landed,

08:21.890 --> 08:26.356
they made us all get off because there were some 
Chinese who weren't going on. They were getting on

08:27.237 --> 08:28.259
Tianjin. There were some people who were 
continuing on. There were some new people who were

08:29.721 --> 08:31.203
going to get off. They made all of us get off. And I 
started talking with a man and his wife and their

08:33.747 --> 08:39.275
two kids. They were... living in Beijing, outside 
of Beijing, north of Beijing, he was there setting

08:43.510 --> 08:56.028
up a poultry farm for poultry, chicken. And, you 
know, they were leaving. They really didn't want

08:57.771 --> 08:59.093
to leave. They were concerned about their friends 
who were back, but talk to them. And I was getting

09:03.018 --> 09:05.502
concerned because it Took longer than an hour, an 
hour and a half. We were getting there in two hours.

09:09.247 --> 09:11.289
We were sitting there, we were supposed to be there 
for an hour. And I was afraid maybe they decided

09:11.329 --> 09:13.653
they were going to shut down all the airports. 
Finally got back on the plane and took off and

09:14.334 --> 09:23.166
landed in Hong Kong Tuesday afternoon. And once I 
got in Hong Kong, then I felt safe. Of course, Hong

09:27.592 --> 09:29.635
Kong was having some demonstrations. As a matter 
of fact, I was concerned when I checked into the

09:30.837 --> 09:35.303
hotel. Because I was there earlier, I wasn't 
supposed to be there until Sunday. I went to the

09:38.879 --> 09:42.203
hotel that I had made reservations for. But they 
weren't sure they were going to have a room or not. I

09:48.751 --> 09:50.093
got there about 3 in the afternoon. They told me to 
come back in an hour. And that's what everybody's

09:51.595 --> 09:53.838
supposed to be checking if you're not. And I ended 
up being able to get a room there. Asked them how

09:56.141 --> 09:59.405
long it would take me to get to the airport the next 
day. And they said, well, you better leave early.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.593
You better leave before 8, even though my plane was 
going to leave until 11. because they were

10:05.894 --> 10:12.402
expecting a big demonstration of three fourths of 
a million people, they would clog up the streets.

10:13.423 --> 10:21.272
So I called my wife, let her know that I had gotten 
out of Beijing. You had no difficulty in making

10:21.413 --> 10:25.097
that call out of Hong Kong. At the airport in 
Beijing, there were no telephones. They had some

10:27.600 --> 10:31.265
telephone booths, but there weren't any 
telephones in there. So there was no way to call out

10:31.285 --> 10:35.850
from the airport to let her know that I'd gotten 
that far. But when I called her, you know, let her

10:36.235 --> 10:42.644
know that everything was okay. And then got a good 
night's sleep and then left on Wednesday, left

10:42.664 --> 10:55.362
Hong Kong on Wednesday to go to Tokyo and then back. 
And Tokyo to Houston? Well, to San Francisco and

10:57.004 --> 10:59.087
then to Houston. okay um i have like two questions 
i'd like to ask one if you could do the trip over

11:00.738 --> 11:28.922
again would there be any one thing that you wished 
you had made a different choice at i i guess the the

11:00.738 --> 11:28.922
main thing in terms of a different choice is that i 
wish i had gotten some blow my camera somebody else

11:00.738 --> 11:28.922
get a picture of me standing in front of the the 
statute, the Gossett democracy. I was going to

11:30.737 --> 11:35.023
have all three of us, myself and our two kids, do 
that. Of course, now that opportunity is gone.

11:44.215 --> 11:47.259
Some people ask, why didn't you go back down to the 
square? Why didn't you try to see what was going on?

11:49.181 --> 11:53.908
And I realized that that would be a very foolish 
thing to do. And I still think that I made the right

11:53.988 --> 11:57.232
decision. Once the violence broke out, I realized 
even though it was not directed towards

11:59.260 --> 12:08.970
foreigners, if I just happened to be in the wrong 
place at the wrong time, they were going to stop

11:59.260 --> 12:08.970
shooting because, oh, there goes a foreigner. We 
don't want to shoot him. So I think that I made the

12:11.152 --> 12:17.159
right decision there. OK. And then lastly, you 
shared about the camera. So you had that as visual

12:21.523 --> 12:26.488
images of where you had been. When you got back to 
College Station, I know you had shared with me an

12:29.433 --> 12:35.240
article you wrote called China's Pro-Democracy 
Movement. Did you make any other written records

12:35.821 --> 12:41.869
or journal accounts? Well, when I got back, I was 
one of the first Americans who'd been to Tiananmen

12:42.349 --> 12:47.736
Square and who had come back. So a lot of the news 
media was interested in hearing what I had to say.

12:55.306 --> 13:02.957
One of the TV stations in Houston was at the airport 
when I got there, and I had a radio station in that

12:55.306 --> 13:02.957
calling. And it

13:03.979 --> 13:17.598
upset me in that the main thing they were 
interested in was how many bodies did you see, a

13:03.979 --> 13:17.598
body count, and how much blood was there. Not 
really in terms of what was going on, what was the

13:18.219 --> 13:23.166
significance of this thing, and what was really 
happening. Of

13:24.293 --> 13:31.400
course, my body clock, my biological clock was 
off. I got back here Wednesday, and Thursday

13:31.781 --> 13:53.963
morning, I guess about 3 o'clock in the morning, I 
was, I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep, and so I

13:31.781 --> 13:53.963
went into my den and wrote up a short article that 
was later printed by several papers in Houston and

13:54.297 --> 14:04.372
San Antonio and Austin, around the state and some 
other states, kind of pulling together in a

13:54.297 --> 14:04.372
relatively short form of what I had seen. And then 
over the summer, because I'd given some talks in

14:05.093 --> 14:21.638
that and found out more, kind of tried to make some 
sense for myself as to what I was going on, what had

14:05.093 --> 14:21.638
happened, what led up to the demonstration of what 
happened there and what was going on in China over

14:22.023 --> 14:28.012
the summer. And then I ended up with the six-page 
paper that I sent you. But newspapers aren't

14:36.825 --> 14:50.646
arrested in things that are that long or that 
detailed, so it's more for personal use in

14:36.825 --> 14:50.646
reminding me and giving to friends who were 
arrested, you know, what was really happening,

14:36.825 --> 14:50.646
what was going on. When you say the newspapers, for 
example, did the local newspaper here in College

14:51.368 --> 15:05.504
Station interested in your work, or was it only... 
Yeah, both the local newspaper and the local TV

14:51.368 --> 15:05.504
station, they came out. Again, the first question 
was, you know, how many bodies did you see, how many

15:06.185 --> 15:10.129
people did you see killed? And even though I told 
them that I did not see anybody killed on that,

15:11.070 --> 15:21.021
still in the newspaper article, There was some 
mention that I'd seen some people shot. I want to

15:26.116 --> 15:27.578
give them the benefit of the doubt. They tried the 
best they could to take a relatively long

15:27.618 --> 15:38.367
interview and get the gist of what was going on. But 
I guess they think they've got to make it

15:39.448 --> 15:49.017
interesting to the viewers and the readers, so 
they've got to get some of that type of stuff in

15:39.448 --> 15:49.017
there. I wouldn't give them the doubt. It was an 
honest effort, honest mistake. They weren't

15:54.174 --> 16:01.501
deliberately trying to twist what I had said into 
something that I hadn't. Lastly, one last

16:01.521 --> 16:08.508
question in terms of do you hope to go back to China 
any time in the near future? If the opportunity

16:08.528 --> 16:12.211
arises, I would love to be able to go back. As long as 
the current regime is in, I don't know if they will

16:13.092 --> 16:16.896
let me go back. I've been rather vocal about what I 
saw. I felt that was something that I owed to the

16:19.838 --> 16:25.324
people in Tiananmen Square. And like I said, there 
were more people who were killed outside of the

16:25.364 --> 16:29.970
square than were killed in the square. I'm 
convinced that the accurate count is more around

16:31.512 --> 16:48.332
2,000 or 3,000 than what some people are putting 
around as a couple of hundred, to let the world know

16:31.512 --> 16:48.332
what happened in the square. if I apply for a visa, 
the Chinese government might not let me go back.

16:51.759 --> 16:56.285
But if they do, I think I would be, it would be safe. I 
don't think they're going to haul me off and throw

16:56.345 --> 17:01.051
me in jail if they let me go back. Of course, I'd have 
to be very careful about what I said and what I did

17:01.612 --> 17:08.060
while I was there, but I would not give them any 
excuse. And I said, if the modern element gains

17:08.080 --> 17:18.133
control after Deng Xiaoping's death and 
continues the reforms and opening up, I think it

17:18.687 --> 17:19.868
would be safe. And I would like to go back and be able 
to see what changes have taken place. And I know my

17:27.378 --> 17:37.090
two older kids were really disappointed that they 
didn't get to go and want to go back there. So if an

17:37.130 --> 17:39.814
opportunity arises, we'll try to get there. You 
would consider going back with the family? Oh,

17:42.437 --> 17:42.697
yeah. Oh, yeah. OK. Thank you very much for sharing 
with us today about your in China at a time that were

17:48.185 --> 17:57.401
very volatile, but of which the Western world is 
very interested in knowing about. Thank you

17:57.441 --> 17:58.465
again.
