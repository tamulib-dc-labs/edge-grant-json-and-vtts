00:01.685 --> 00:09.475
Karen Rossell on April the 6th at Texas A&M 
University concerning reconnaissance missions

00:01.685 --> 00:09.475
flown over Southeast Asia. How many missions did 
you fly? 150.

00:18.225 --> 00:20.868
Did you volunteer or were you sent there? I 
volunteered. Volunteered to go? When did you fly

00:24.753 --> 00:26.415
these missions and where? I flew from January of 
1973 until about mid-November of 1973. And I flew

00:35.251 --> 00:45.701
in all over South Vietnam, all over Laos, and all 
over Cambodia. And I flew a few training missions

00:46.922 --> 00:49.765
over Thailand. What was the purpose of your 
missions during this time period? Intelligence

00:54.309 --> 00:56.171
gathering. Primarily with pictures, although we 
also used a few other sensors like infrared and

00:57.980 --> 01:06.809
visual reconnaissance. What were you trying to 
pick up for the intelligence? What were you trying

01:10.874 --> 01:12.536
to take pictures of? Well, several things. For one 
thing, we did bomb damage assessment, BDA if you

01:16.420 --> 01:27.852
will, of targets that had been struck by various 
means, but primarily targets that had been struck

01:28.574 --> 01:30.377
by air. We also did target development. That is, we 
would run or take pictures or do visual

01:36.225 --> 01:58.277
reconnaissance primarily of roads on the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail, which is basically through Laos, a

01:36.225 --> 01:58.277
system of roads through Laos where the North 
Vietnamese sent troops and supplies down to South

01:36.225 --> 01:58.277
Vietnam. Although we also ran several other 
roads. We looked at a lot of other roads all over

02:03.244 --> 02:15.459
Southeast Asia just to see what was going on on 
those roads and pick out targets for later bombing

02:03.244 --> 02:15.459
or what have you. Did you have any other 
involvement in Southeast Asia prior to these

02:15.999 --> 02:19.143
missions? Any type of at-home involvement, like 
maybe doing stuff that like relay stuff as opposed

02:20.184 --> 02:28.615
to being actually over there? No. I guess not. No. 
What were your feelings on the war and the United

02:34.965 --> 02:38.450
States' involvement in the war? And did it change 
over time? Did you have like a certain opinion when

02:40.672 --> 02:47.862
you first, you know, like in the early 60s and then 
as time progressed, did your opinion change on it?

02:50.245 --> 02:58.555
I'd say my opinion remained fairly consistent 
from about 1960...

02:59.294 --> 03:16.738
four up until 75 my feelings were relatively 
stable and I primarily thought that we were

02:59.294 --> 03:16.738
screwing up pretty badly by not taking a tougher 
stance, i.e.

03:20.042 --> 03:27.833
bombing North Vietnam heavily and not 
restricting ourselves so much. What kind of

03:28.387 --> 03:33.695
information were you given as to why you were there 
and what was going on there? Were you well informed

03:33.995 --> 03:43.329
as to exactly why you were going over there, or was 
it kind of like you were just going and you really

03:33.995 --> 03:43.329
didn't know exactly what your mission was at the 
time? Well, I knew exactly what I was going to do. I

03:46.514 --> 03:57.010
was well informed, I guess, from my little piece of 
the pie, realizing, of course, I was only 29 years

03:46.514 --> 03:57.010
old and...

03:57.513 --> 04:11.650
a young captain, so I was not one of the major 
planners, nor a major leader, but I knew exactly

03:57.513 --> 04:11.650
what I was going to have to do, and there were very 
few surprises to me. So you were well informed of

04:11.871 --> 04:14.474
what the situation was over there? Because in our 
class we've learned that a lot of stuff was kept

04:14.494 --> 04:21.883
from the people in the United States, a lot of stuff 
was I guess like the Gulf of Tonkin resolution

04:22.167 --> 04:25.932
stuff, stuff wasn't told the way it actually 
happened. It was kind of masked. Were they more

04:27.994 --> 04:31.018
informative with you on stuff like that? Well, I'm 
not sure I know what you mean by that. I'm not sure I

04:35.042 --> 04:38.387
know what you're talking about with the Gulf of 
Tonkin resolution. They said that some of the

04:38.747 --> 04:48.799
stuff was told to the public that it was happening 
at a more escalated rate than it actually was. the

04:49.252 --> 04:53.576
United States may not have needed to react as 
quickly because things weren't actually

04:49.252 --> 04:53.576
happening. They kind of upscaled it to get the 
American people behind it. Well, the Gulf of

04:58.220 --> 05:03.125
Tonkin resolution was in the mid-60s somewhere. I 
believe it was about 63 or 64, wasn't it? Yeah, it

05:05.507 --> 05:07.228
was pretty early. And when I went over there, it was 
almost 10 years later. And for me to give an

05:11.352 --> 05:16.997
accurate assessment of... of our public affairs, 
the military's public relations with

05:18.260 --> 05:31.161
the press, I can't evaluate that because I really 
don't know. I can tell you that I felt fairly well

05:31.181 --> 05:35.528
informed. That's not to suggest, however, that I 
knew or understood everything that was going on in

05:35.588 --> 05:45.043
all of those countries because it was a very 
complicated war. What kind of preparatory

05:45.580 --> 05:48.965
information were you given before these 
missions?

05:51.629 --> 05:59.380
Well, it sort of depended on where I was going and 
what I was doing. We flew a lot of different tactics

05:59.400 --> 06:02.785
while I was there. In one year, things changed a lot 
and we did a lot of different kinds of things and we

06:03.005 --> 06:08.754
flew in several different countries. So it 
depended on where we were going. But essentially,

06:10.917 --> 06:13.140
prior to every mission, got an intelligence 
briefing by typically a fairly young

06:13.812 --> 06:29.274
intelligence officer on what the situation was, 
where we were going to be going, and then an

06:13.812 --> 06:29.274
overview of what was going on all over Southeast 
Asia. So in general, I felt a pretty good idea of

06:29.294 --> 06:37.446
what was going on. Does that answer your question? 
Yeah. Were you given any type of cultural

06:39.249 --> 06:41.372
background into the Southeast Asian culture 
before you went? Not in any great detail except to

06:47.213 --> 06:57.590
the extent of how to deal with captors in the event 
of coming to POW. Okay, that's the next question.

06:59.133 --> 07:06.145
What would happen if you were shot down and taken 
prisoner and how are you prepared for this event?

07:06.682 --> 07:15.834
as well prepared as one could be at the time when I 
went over there because by that time we had a lot of

07:06.682 --> 07:15.834
intelligence on how the POWs were being treated 
and what was going on. So I was, I felt like I was well

07:16.054 --> 07:27.809
prepared

07:16.054 --> 07:27.809
as far as knowing what to expect when I became a POW. 
I knew that. What kind of things did they tell you to

07:28.931 --> 07:30.573
expect?

07:33.977 --> 07:36.300
Well, that's a wide-ranging question. But in 
general,

07:36.449 --> 07:49.486
fairly rough treatment by the general population 
if you were not picked up by regular troops. But if

07:50.186 --> 07:54.812
you were picked up by civilians, you could expect 
very rough treatment, perhaps not to survive. If

07:54.832 --> 08:05.646
you were picked up by regular military troops, you 
could expect to get a little bit better treatment

07:54.832 --> 08:05.646
and to initially start out with intense 
interrogation, poor treatment to include

08:06.031 --> 08:13.622
physical abuse. And then shortly after that, 
isolation for a period of time, varying depending

08:14.864 --> 08:25.419
on where you were and what was going on. It could 
vary how long you'd be in isolation. And then

08:28.323 --> 08:35.633
ultimately to rejoin and be with other prisoners. 
And that's just a very short synopsis,

08:38.009 --> 08:47.442
but we felt like we were fairly well, or I felt like I 
was fairly well prepared. And since I was in a

08:47.882 --> 09:04.264
high-threat aircraft, the RF-4, I expected

08:47.882 --> 09:04.264
I had a better chance of being shot down than a lot of 
other people over there. So I more or less expected

09:04.284 --> 09:06.447
it to happen. Were these missions kept from the 
general public? By the way, there was another

09:09.659 --> 09:11.601
problem. Excuse me. Another problem developed 
while I was there that might be interesting. The

09:17.306 --> 09:21.450
POWs were released in March of 1973. So I was still 
flying until November. So we had some difficulty

09:26.736 --> 09:28.437
there. We were not certain. Our rules were vague on 
what was going to happen if we got shot down.

09:38.438 --> 09:42.763
because we were still flying combat missions, and 
this is not commonly known, I guess. We were still

09:43.264 --> 09:52.454
flying a lot of combat missions after the POWs were 
released, and we weren't real sure what was going

09:43.264 --> 09:52.454
to happen to us if we got shot down. In other words, 
who was going to come help us was a question,

09:53.175 --> 10:02.707
which caused us a little bit of concern. We were not 
Concerned over whether you'd be recognized for

10:04.190 --> 10:06.752
actually being there? No, concerned over whether 
or not we would be, well, let's see, how can I say

10:06.832 --> 10:15.259
this? Whether or not we'd get

10:15.640 --> 10:34.095
a good strong attempt at a rescue, let's put it that 
way, a search and error rescue, because the POWs

10:15.640 --> 10:34.095
had already been released and it was kind of, we 
weren't real sure what the rules were going to be,

10:15.640 --> 10:34.095
that's the best way to put it. We more or less 
expected Air America to help us. So it wasn't

10:37.483 --> 10:41.748
common public knowledge that you were there after 
the POWs were released? Well, I'm not sure if it was

10:41.949 --> 10:43.550
or not. I guess it probably wasn't. I don't think a 
lot of people realize that there was still an air

10:45.212 --> 10:58.868
war going on, or that is, U.S. air was being used 
extensively after the POWs had been released, at

10:45.212 --> 10:58.868
least all through the year of 73. Were you able to 
tell your family about these missions, or were

10:59.889 --> 11:04.234
they, I guess if they were intelligence, they 
were... probably I I don't I didn't I don't know I

11:04.737 --> 11:30.373
guess I could have but I didn't think that they 
didn't tell them I didn't think they'd understand

11:04.737 --> 11:30.373
okay do you know how these pictures were to be used I 
mean what they what exactly I guess they were used

11:04.737 --> 11:30.373
to to find targets and did I know how they were going 
to be used yes I knew how they were going to be used

11:04.737 --> 11:30.373
okay uh I was uh well depending on what they If it was 
BDA, it was going to be used to determine how much

11:31.619 --> 11:37.307
damage was done to a target and whether or not it had 
to be struck again. And if I was searching for

11:37.347 --> 11:47.140
targets, I knew that if I found them, that we would 
ultimately go back and hit them, probably. And

11:47.160 --> 11:50.004
that was the concept. From what you saw, were there 
any different policies that could have been

11:50.024 --> 11:56.934
followed to keep communism out of Southeast Asia 
besides the further bombing of the North? You

11:57.575 --> 11:58.656
already said that earlier, but... Any policies 
that you thought that the government could have

12:00.155 --> 12:10.008
taken

12:00.155 --> 12:10.008
to, I guess, to cause a winning situation? Well, I 
don't really, I don't think I feel qualified to

12:10.028 --> 12:16.958
answer that question, although I'll give you a 
sarcastic answer. Yeah, we could have chosen the

12:17.218 --> 12:18.720
other side. And that's a theory that's been put 
forth before, is we could have taken the other

12:20.262 --> 12:23.947
side. We could have taken Ho Chi Minh's side and 
perhaps kept communism out of there that way. What

12:30.260 --> 12:33.463
do you think of the role of the press in Southeast 
Asia? I know that a lot of people say that they think

12:33.483 --> 12:36.566
that the press lost the war. What's your opinion on 
that? No, I don't think it was the press. No, I don't

12:40.050 --> 12:44.194
think the press was a factor in causing the war to be 
lost. I don't think the war... I'm not sure I even

12:46.015 --> 12:48.097
agree that the war was lost. But I don't think the 
press had that much to do with it. I think the

12:54.604 --> 12:57.887
administrations who were running the war screwed 
it up and could have handled the press better um

12:58.711 --> 13:25.444
what do you think of the role the cia had what kind of 
involvement the cia had in southeast asia do you

12:58.711 --> 13:25.444
know of anything again i'm not a i'm not i'm not sure 
i'm qualified to answer that uh what do i think of

12:58.711 --> 13:25.444
the cia's role or yeah what do you i mean do you think 
they had a big role or that maybe their role could

12:58.711 --> 13:25.444
have been bigger or that they could have done 
something else or done less? Well, they had a

13:28.857 --> 13:33.923
pretty big role, and I'm not sure exactly how big. I 
know that they

13:33.983 --> 13:39.751
were participants. I saw them participate, 
especially with airplanes in Air America.

13:47.641 --> 13:49.684
But I don't feel qualified to answer that. I don't 
think I know. What do you know about Air America?

13:55.589 --> 14:00.435
Personally, I've never heard anything about it 
until in this class that I'm taking. What kind of

14:00.856 --> 14:03.139
role did they have? What did they do? Well, they 
essentially did things that the military could

14:04.541 --> 14:09.907
not do.

14:13.211 --> 14:19.740
They flew a lot of dangerous missions over there 
that we didn't or would not fly or could not fly.

14:21.101 --> 14:21.722
They landed in places where we couldn't go.

14:27.782 --> 14:46.121
They flew unmarked airplanes, and they were an 
airline, you know, and technically, I guess, not

14:27.782 --> 14:46.121
representing

14:27.782 --> 14:46.121
or the theory was that they were not representing 
the U.S. government. What was the purpose of them

14:46.161 --> 14:48.503
being there? Because I know that in the movie that 
they had on Air America, they had that they were

14:49.057 --> 15:01.070
dropping, I know that that was an awful movie, but 
they were dropping food and stuff like that over

14:49.057 --> 15:01.070
Laos and Cambodia mostly. Well, they did a lot of 
that. They operated a lot in Laos, I know that.

15:10.061 --> 15:13.244
Was that the major purpose of their mission, was to 
feed the people? Well, that was one of the

15:15.587 --> 15:17.629
missions. But I mean, they weren't there to help 
the Pathet Lao or the communist Laos take over the

15:18.200 --> 15:29.476
country, I can tell you that. They were on our side, 
our side being against communism. And that's an

15:34.484 --> 15:38.229
oversimplification, I realize, but I really 
don't know any other way to say it. And as far as

15:40.212 --> 15:47.042
getting into detail about their operations, I 
can't, because I just don't know that much about

15:40.212 --> 15:47.042
it. What do you think of Jane Fonda's role in 
Southeast Asia, or what kind of effect she had?

15:57.906 --> 16:04.274
Well, I kind of hate to dignify Jane Fonda by even 
discussing her. I think that it's unfortunate

16:06.797 --> 16:16.928
that the press would have given her the time that 
they did. in the public eye. And I would join with

16:19.493 --> 16:37.141
all the POWs and most of the military people who 
were around during that era in despising what she

16:19.493 --> 16:37.141
stood for and what she represented. And I guess it 
remains a fairly emotional issue with me as it does

16:38.804 --> 16:43.371
with most other people who were in the military at 
that time. She had an impact, and she did, and you

16:48.231 --> 16:59.223
can ask most of the POWs, she caused problems for 
them by going to North Vietnam. Do you think that

16:59.243 --> 17:08.513
she was, because I've heard that there were other 
people that had the same view, that she got more

16:59.243 --> 17:08.513
press than, because she was already famous, that 
she got more press than other people. Do you know

17:08.533 --> 17:14.640
anything about any other people that were 
involved in that, or in her same mission for going

17:08.533 --> 17:14.640
over there and her Well, I'm sure that there were 
others. I don't know who they were, and I don't

17:16.924 --> 17:19.009
remember. I mean, that's been so many years ago 
now, and I don't remember who they were. I'm sure

17:21.995 --> 17:27.827
there were others, but she's the one who sticks out 
in my mind and most other folks' minds, and she's

17:21.995 --> 17:27.827
the one who's remembered. And she got so much 
press. She got so much press. Okay, that's it.

17:33.479 --> 17:34.080
Thank you.
