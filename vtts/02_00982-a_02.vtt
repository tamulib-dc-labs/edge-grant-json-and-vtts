WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:04.950
And again, we set up to stay behind ambush. And we 
pulled this off three times in one morning. And

00:12.459 --> 00:18.846
militarily, it was very successful. And then the 
next day, we had pamphlets printed up how terrible

00:18.966 --> 00:26.815
the Viet Cong was. We were trying to serve the 
people of the area for medical programs. The only

00:35.749 --> 00:40.173
thing they wanted to do was kill us. We had their 
interests in mind. These pamphlets were printed

00:44.757 --> 00:48.881
up and dropped by aircraft over the area. You can 
see how we used it, not only militarily, but

00:48.941 --> 00:57.308
propaganda-wise. My medical program. After the 
propaganda, was there any more trouble with this

01:00.063 --> 01:04.329
sort of thing?

01:07.193 --> 01:07.553
Oh yes. Another thing I did was that I could get free 
food and clothing often. to strengthen the local

01:22.752 --> 01:39.816
government in the area was that for anybody to get 
the free food or clothing and things like this that

01:22.752 --> 01:39.816
they had to have a VFNE's ID card, which they had to 
register for and so on. And for free food and

01:42.180 --> 01:49.570
clothing, because of the requirement I set down 
and then I would have the local village chief or

01:50.292 --> 02:05.397
whoever handle the paperwork and check the people 
off and make sure they had the proper

01:50.292 --> 02:05.397
identification before they received any. And 
this way I strengthened the local officials

02:05.557 --> 02:09.904
there. And one trick that I did was that I could get 
T-shirts, children T-shirts that were basically

02:10.458 --> 02:26.964
red with three yellow stripes diagonally across 
it. And a lot of the children, say, under seven,

02:27.444 --> 02:36.178
eight years old, didn't have a stitch of clothes on 
them. And so I would, when I went into a village, I

02:36.462 --> 02:43.451
would give them these t-shirts, and that was the 
only clothes they had. And of course, these were

02:44.212 --> 02:46.515
Viet Cong village. But this was just like having a 
South Vietnamese flag. And I'm sure there was a lot

02:52.903 --> 03:00.533
of family arguments later on over the t-shirts. 
What were the major diseases of the Vietnamese

03:01.675 --> 03:05.760
that Probably

03:06.500 --> 03:17.855
the most deadly was pneumonia.

03:20.479 --> 03:22.682
But saw everything. I even had at one time four 
cases of rabies. Rabies, where did they pick that

03:27.589 --> 03:30.613
up from? From a rabid dog. And in fact when I heard 
about they brought in a child to me that was bitten

03:32.572 --> 03:43.066
by a rabid dog and of course I wanted to go out and see 
the dog. And I went out there and the dog evidently

03:44.108 --> 03:53.821
followed them in the camp when they came into the 
camp. And when I went out there he started to come

03:54.782 --> 04:02.072
towards me and normally I always wore a .45 even on 
sick call and I had my .45 out and was about ready to

04:02.474 --> 04:13.786
blow it up and it died right in front of me and it was 
rabid.

04:17.230 --> 04:32.346
How did you learn to, I know you had medical 
training and stuff so I'm sure that helped, but how

04:17.230 --> 04:32.346
did you learn to cope with death?

04:32.697 --> 05:01.708
I guess part of our training was that way because 
we, at that time, at the advanced medical

04:32.697 --> 05:01.708
training lab, which was eight weeks long after we 
had approximately

04:32.697 --> 05:01.708
say over a year of training before that, if we got 
through that we went to advanced medical lab and we

05:02.009 --> 05:31.813
had patients there and the patients were the dogs 
around Fayetteville that were going to be

05:02.009 --> 05:31.813
destroyed by the animal control anyway and what 
they would do they would shoot the dog in the hind

05:02.009 --> 05:31.813
leg with an M1 and of course this was done under very 
humane conditions the dog was asleep and

05:02.009 --> 05:31.813
everything and then we would perform surgery on 
the dog to remove, to debris the dead tissue and so

05:32.317 --> 05:37.803
on. And we had regular surgical teams like a 
surgeon, assistant surgeon, scrub nurse,

05:38.063 --> 05:46.913
anesthetist, and so on. And after a debris month, 
we could not use any antibiotics to treat any

05:47.754 --> 05:58.206
infection, but we had to treat the infection by 
cleaning it out four or five times a day. And then we

06:02.567 --> 06:13.782
would go ahead and put the dog back under 
anesthetic and do a secondary closure and make

06:02.567 --> 06:13.782
sure that healed up good without any infection. 
And then the last time we put it under anesthetic,

06:14.423 --> 06:20.811
we would do an amputation. And after the 
amputation, we would actually

06:21.452 --> 06:27.180
kill the dog with the anesthetic and since they 
were going to be destroyed anyway and

06:27.582 --> 06:48.280
if your patient did not survive, died on you, you 
had to do an autopsy on the patient and then you got a

06:27.582 --> 06:48.280
new one and you started all over again. So there was 
a lot of sleepless nights taking care of your

06:49.061 --> 06:57.268
patient during the training and I think on the 
whole that they

06:57.586 --> 07:25.703
trained us for deaf because I can remember in some 
of the classes that in my final training, which was

06:57.586 --> 07:25.703
a 13 week training period, that

06:57.586 --> 07:25.703
two of the main instructors would inform us almost 
every day of who died over in Vietnam, and I can

07:26.189 --> 07:35.278
remember it was getting up to over 350. They would 
number them, and generally, probably nine

07:35.758 --> 07:48.711
percent of them were Special Forces, and they 
would know the people, and they would tell us

07:35.758 --> 07:48.711
something about the people. So we were very, we 
knew that where we were going was not an easy place

07:56.058 --> 07:59.222
to stay alive. Did you find that American 
technology was very useful to medics? Oh yes,

08:08.055 --> 08:20.612
because the local medicine around there, they 
were using like suction cups and bleeding the

08:08.055 --> 08:20.612
patients and things like this. And they had their 
local

08:26.669 --> 08:32.697
which doctors or whatever you want to call them 
that they did a treatment. What was the strengths

08:33.779 --> 08:42.170
and weaknesses that you saw in the American forces 
in caring for the wounded? Well, of course

08:44.413 --> 08:55.107
Americans normally could get evacuated out of the 
valley area when they were wounded very rapidly to

08:44.413 --> 08:55.107
a a field hospital and be taken, have very good care 
taken of them and

08:56.386 --> 09:26.055
with very well trained personnel and evacuated 
from there back to the United States or to like

08:56.386 --> 09:26.055
Okinawa, Japan very fast, which was full-fledged 
hospitals and was excellent. How were they

09:26.626 --> 09:28.409
evacuated usually? By trucks or by helicopters? 
By choppers. What

09:31.874 --> 09:41.367
were some weaknesses or were there any that you 
could have seen been improved? Well, as far as my

09:42.248 --> 09:51.722
unit was, we were sort of stuck out there in nowhere 
and the only time we could get air support was when

09:52.377 --> 10:04.908
we had an American hit or his life was in danger of

09:52.377 --> 10:04.908
being there. And only one time that happened was 
when one of my teammates was killed, that we got air

10:05.028 --> 10:13.356
support. Other than that, we had no air support 
whatsoever. What about the availability of

10:17.659 --> 10:21.743
blood? Because that would seem like it would be a 
vital supply. I had none. But I did have gem

10:31.615 --> 10:45.756
garbium, which is a form of plasma, but 
concentrated. As far as it went on the VF knees,

10:46.327 --> 10:55.359
that 50 cc's of gamgobium IV was just like a unit of 
blood. How was this usually transported to you? It

10:59.786 --> 11:04.973
was regular cans and IV bottles. I generally 
carried at least two of them around with me every

11:06.475 --> 11:10.941
time I went on patrol. What were the other supplies 
that you carried with you in your medical kit?

11:16.718 --> 11:21.905
Well, basic bandages and wire splints and things 
like this. It all depended on the patrol. If I was

11:28.955 --> 11:43.114
going out to set up a medical treatment someplace, 
of course I carried much larger supplies and so on

11:28.955 --> 11:43.114
to treat with the idea of treating anywhere from 50 
to maybe 200 or 300 people that day, which I had to

11:43.735 --> 11:59.777
take a whole range of medications and antibiotics 
and other things such as that. Was there ever any

12:01.580 --> 12:05.726
problem with the supplies running low? 
Sometimes.

12:13.925 --> 12:18.850
Probably the most used medication I had was 
antibiotics. And I would say, if I ever ran out, of

12:19.631 --> 12:41.194
course I always figured on a large supply ahead and

12:19.631 --> 12:41.194
was really planning on it, and I kept a large supply 
at the camp. When the supplies would run low, And if

12:44.350 --> 13:00.415
y'all were like invaded, were there ever, you 
know, did your priorities as far as who to treat and

12:44.350 --> 13:00.415
how to treat, did they change as a result of the 
shortage in supplies at all? No, but we did have

13:00.615 --> 13:05.823
some supplies that were for Americans only. And, 
uh, uh, and, uh, uh, Basically,

13:14.692 --> 13:38.693
it was very rare that I had to not treat someone with 
a secondary

13:14.692 --> 13:38.693
medication than the

13:14.692 --> 13:38.693
preferred medication. I guess I'd like to shift 
gears just a little bit and talk a little bit about

13:43.598 --> 13:48.463
you as far as your experiences. How were you 
injured? What were the conditions? Well,

13:54.408 --> 14:03.417
it was not very dramatic. It wasn't any big battle. 
We had a big operation going that day and

14:06.019 --> 14:12.846
planned out the conventional pincher action that 
we would send one unit well we had one unit going

14:13.501 --> 14:42.208
north one south and then they swing around and then 
we would have a major unit go west as a sweep and try

14:13.501 --> 14:42.208
to get caught between the higher two units and a 
crossfire and I was on a unit that went north which

14:13.501 --> 14:42.208
we left you know about three or four hours early so 
we could make a wide circle so they wouldn't know

14:42.492 --> 15:10.407
what was coming and tried to do it that way and while

14:42.492 --> 15:10.407
we were making these wide sweeps we would call in 
our position and the mortars were trained from the

14:42.492 --> 15:10.407
camp in other words they walked in front of us In 
case we ran into an ambush, the only thing we had to

15:10.690 --> 15:14.996
do was hit the radio and say, fire. And the mortars 
would be firing, you know, 100, 200 yards in front

15:16.098 --> 15:25.131
of us at all times. And what happened was I was 
taking a compass reading, and a booby trap grenade

15:26.233 --> 15:40.073
went off where I was standing, right under my feet. 
And that's how I was injured. In fact, my team

15:43.006 --> 15:52.180
sergeant claimed that he stepped on the grenade 
before I did and probably primed it. And so when I

15:52.401 --> 15:56.607
was standing on and taking the compass reading, it 
exploded. And

15:56.647 --> 16:08.305
one unusual thing was that this was, I was going on 
my 11th month in Vietnam, and was the only day that I

16:08.858 --> 16:19.090
knew that I

16:08.858 --> 16:19.090
was going to be a casualty. I told my CO at the time 
that that day was my day. Was it just intuition?

16:26.038 --> 16:27.219
Sixth Sense. What was the extent of the injury?

16:39.858 --> 16:51.956
The only external injury was I picked up shrapnel 
wounds in my left foot and ankle and with broken

16:39.858 --> 16:51.956
bones in my left foot. My right foot was completely 
broken up and no external injuries but the

16:51.976 --> 17:08.700
concussion, I probably, I was standing on, it went 
off under my right foot and so it got most of the

16:51.976 --> 17:08.700
concussion. which led to rupture of all the blood 
vessels and therefore the foot did not get any

17:09.490 --> 17:35.919
blood circulation so what they called dry 
gangrene and seven days later they had to amputate

17:09.490 --> 17:35.919
it because it was just a dead piece of meat. What 
were your immediate thoughts? Since you had kind

17:39.190 --> 17:47.463
of sensed it, what went through your mind as the 
injury occurred? Well, it wasn't until later that

17:49.406 --> 17:55.275
I remembered that I knew it was going to happen. The 
unit I was with that went on and left me there with

17:55.997 --> 18:05.772
two Vietnamese soldiers and I was only about a 
hundred yards from the Cambodian border, which

18:07.152 --> 18:23.166
was somewhat dangerous, and I knew that if the Viet 
Cong found me there, the two Viet Minh soldiers

18:07.152 --> 18:23.166
would have hightailed it and left me there. So my 
main concern was preparing myself to fight to the

18:23.687 --> 18:36.518
death.

18:37.021 --> 18:41.866
immediate hospital care like in Vietnam? I can't 
really say because after I got to Saigon and put in

18:41.886 --> 18:53.817
the hospital, they gave me a shot and knocked me 
out. I can't really remember anything until

18:55.139 --> 19:06.690
approximately two or three weeks later because I 
went in a coma because I had blood clots that moved

18:55.139 --> 19:06.690
up to my brain and I received 30% brain damage from 
the bug spots. When you were coming back to the

19:14.984 --> 19:28.564
United States, what was the emotions like coming 
back on the trip back?

19:29.325 --> 19:33.431
I just wanted to get back to the States.

19:34.432 --> 19:34.973
I know When I finally got back to the States about 
three weeks later, when they went into Travis Air

19:36.168 --> 19:47.663
Force Base, I just wanted to kiss the ground when I 
got back here. What was the date that you arrived

19:48.123 --> 19:50.346
back? I can't remember. When you got back,

19:53.490 --> 20:00.659
you said you were at Travis.

20:01.961 --> 20:04.304
How long were you at Travis? Just overnight. And 
then I flew into here in San Antonio

20:05.345 --> 20:20.705
to Brook Army Medical Center and I spent two and a 
half years there being put back together.

20:23.749 --> 20:27.714
What was your relations with the hospital staff 
like at Brooks? Very good.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.002
Were there any problems that you had with them at 
all? A few of them with the nurses, but after I was

20:38.289 --> 21:01.137
able to get up and get around,

20:38.289 --> 21:01.137
most of the doctors found out of my medical 
training, and when they went around to do bandage

20:38.289 --> 21:01.137
changes on most of the other patients, they 
preferred me to. work with them because my

21:01.403 --> 21:11.595
knowledge of how to do bandage changes was 
probably greater than the nurses were there. The

21:13.036 --> 21:22.967
nurses resented this quite a bit, but that was all 
right.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.833
You got to realize I was wounded in September of 65, 
and my enlistment was up in November of 65. So after

21:35.748 --> 21:42.315
a year in the hospital, you know, my enlistment was 
already a year past. And if I wanted a three-day

21:43.036 --> 21:48.162
pass, I just would tell the doctor I wanted a 
three-day pass. And he said, no, I can't give you

21:48.182 --> 21:50.444
one. I said, okay, don't look for me. Monday or 
Friday I'd take off and when I got back they had the

21:52.214 --> 21:58.922
three day pass for me assigned. So they were very 
cooperative. Well, what could they do?

22:06.991 --> 22:13.538
I've read where there's been problems as far as for 
Vietnam veterans in the hospitals. Some of the

22:14.199 --> 22:20.466
major problems were like age gap because I know I 
can I'm not sure, but it seemed like the Vietnam

22:21.323 --> 22:30.036
veterans were much younger than most of the other 
veterans in the hospital. This is only, I would

22:32.079 --> 22:36.165
say, to the VA hospital.

22:39.489 --> 22:46.319
When I was initially wounded in the Army 
hospitals, it was mostly from Vietnam. Although

22:46.339 --> 22:48.883
there was some soldiers there, that was their 
third war.

22:57.272 --> 22:59.877
But yet there was camaraderie. Of course there was

23:00.398 --> 23:07.631
different things. The Marines thought they were 
And of course the special forces thought they were

23:10.295 --> 23:15.322
too. The Air Force always got the low end of the 
stick.

23:22.152 --> 23:26.619
It

23:22.152 --> 23:26.619
was the normal thing. You got to realize that after 
I was there, when I got there in the hospital there

23:27.700 --> 23:39.778
was only six amputees and three of us was from 
Vietnam and three of us from car accidents. and by

23:39.978 --> 24:03.120
the year's time it grew up to almost a hundred 
amputees there in the hospital and they had to open

23:39.978 --> 24:03.120
up a whole ward that they were saving for national 
disaster for it and make it just a purely amputee

23:39.978 --> 24:03.120
ward. But there was some racial problems, of 
course, but nothing great.

24:13.477 --> 24:26.432
In the VA, was there ever any, did you ever find any 
lack of communication between, say, the doctors

24:13.477 --> 24:26.432
and the patients? Yes. Most of your VA hospitals 
you'll find are next to medical centers or medical

24:38.078 --> 24:38.699
schools. And you get a lot of students over there, 
maybe second and third year medical students

24:40.081 --> 24:48.092
playing doctor. And like I am, by the time I go, when 
I need to go to the VA hospital for something, I

24:49.775 --> 25:03.475
don't even know what it is and what needs to be done 
and so on. And sometimes I have run runs with the

25:03.495 --> 25:08.001
young kids and most of them don't like to be told 
what to do. But on the whole I've gotten into

25:15.905 --> 25:34.309
most of the

25:15.905 --> 25:34.309
doctors I see most of the time are the ones I choose. 
I work around and get that way, which most patients

25:35.116 --> 25:40.162
don't know how to do. How do you go about doing this? 
Well, I do homework first. If I don't like

25:47.772 --> 25:51.837
somebody, I just tell them that, and I wish to see 
somebody else. If I have to do that three or four

25:52.959 --> 26:00.989
times, I do until I get somebody I have confidence 
in, and then I go with them. It's that easy. I think

26:02.992 --> 26:04.093
your medical... training has helped quite a bit 
too. Yes. Now a lot of people they don't realize

26:09.090 --> 26:25.831
that just recently this Freedom of Information 
Act also applies to all hospitals and even the

26:09.090 --> 26:25.831
civilians. If a civilian wants to know in a 
civilian hospital why he's being treated for and

26:26.552 --> 26:33.540
the medications and how much medication and so on 
and what side effects, the hospital has to tell

26:33.925 --> 26:40.855
you. And if you want your records from that 
hospital, they have to provide them for you. And a

26:49.347 --> 27:02.987
lot of people don't know this, but you can get real 
stiff about and you get done.

27:04.722 --> 27:24.243
In fact, this last summer when I was up in Oregon 
with my mother with an accident,

27:04.722 --> 27:24.243
I really put a few nurses through the wringer that 
they thought they could slough me off. In fact,

27:24.443 --> 27:26.665
some doctors also did that. They would say, well, 
it's the administration. I would say, Well, what

27:31.334 --> 27:33.256
do you mean by administration? Well, the Board of 
Review. What's the Board of Review? Well, I said,

27:37.920 --> 27:41.803
where the patient can pay or not, right? And they 
said, yes. And I said, well, you don't have to worry

27:43.344 --> 27:45.326
about that. That's my worry. And get things taken 
care of that way. And sometimes I got pretty pushy,

27:50.130 --> 27:55.795
but I got things done. Yeah. Have you ever run 
across any dishonesty in the VA, or as far as, like,

28:01.321 --> 28:12.235
the nurses saying things, as far as, like, 
treatment or something like that? Well, the VA

28:12.816 --> 28:17.482
system is a whole different ballgame. And, of 
course, my major concern with the VA system is this

28:19.405 --> 28:25.733
Agent Orange. And the VA has cut and dried that's 
put out by Washington, the head Veterans

28:32.371 --> 28:40.960
Administration Office, what the VA does. And the 
personnel who work for the VA can't else, have to

28:42.382 --> 28:53.193
follow those instructions, and they're very 
limited. And if, I know when I went in for my initial

28:54.855 --> 29:01.922
interview about Agent Orange, They called in the 
security, because if I was getting a little too

29:02.560 --> 29:12.613
forceful, I'd tell them what's what. But I got my 
point across. And it really irked me that a nurse

29:17.238 --> 29:22.625
did the interview and not a doctor. How do you feel 
about the medical services being circumscribed

29:23.606 --> 29:32.297
according to criteria unrelated to medical 
needs. They don't look at your injuries or your

29:35.522 --> 29:41.192
treatments that you need. They look at other 
things into consideration. Well,

29:45.579 --> 29:55.416
of course money is one of the major things.

29:57.522 --> 30:04.090
If the VA hospital here was twice the size, it still 
would be filled, I believe. I honestly believe

30:04.670 --> 30:06.312
that. And why it's so terrible about it is that

30:07.173 --> 30:15.583
they don't have it. And then the other

30:15.603 --> 30:27.276
thing is the veteran is ill-informed of what his 
rights are. Because when they put it out, they

30:27.847 --> 30:38.956
either put it out in a language that a normal person 
cannot understand, or they put only half-truths

30:27.847 --> 30:38.956
out.

30:43.560 --> 30:54.990
While you were recuperating back at Travis, were 
you expected to maintain a military appearance

30:43.560 --> 30:54.990
with the haircut? Well, at Travis I only spent 
overnight. Oh. But at Brooke, yes, you were. I had

31:05.336 --> 31:15.304
no problem with that whatsoever because I believe 
in it and there was no difficulty.

31:19.148 --> 31:27.435
Probably the biggest problem was a lack of

31:19.148 --> 31:27.435
medical help From doctors on down, as you went 
down, it got less and less. In fact, there on the

31:35.492 --> 31:42.502
amputee ward, they wanted amputees to mop and buff 
the floors and things like this. And the nurses was

31:43.644 --> 31:47.690
always telling me to do this and do that about that. 
I would tell them, well, heck, I'm an NCO. You give

31:51.776 --> 31:56.342
me some war-ranked people and I would be 
supervisor of the detail. They never could get a

31:59.927 --> 32:07.956
detail up, so I never supervised anything.

32:07.976 --> 32:10.299
I bet they loved you. Oh, they did.

32:19.629 --> 32:22.212
What was the morale like back at Brooks? It 
depended on

32:28.469 --> 32:57.852
unit and normally you'll find somebody with 
severe injuries such as amputation or anything

32:28.469 --> 32:57.852
like that if the person has the will to survive and 
to do what he wants to do even though with handicaps

32:28.469 --> 32:57.852
that they will do it but if they don't they become a 
there's a big difference between being

32:58.152 --> 33:04.179
handicapped and being a cripple. And most of the 
people who are cripples are because of their

33:05.361 --> 33:13.590
mental outlook on it. They say, okay, I'm a 
cripple, I will be a cripple. Not that what I can do,

33:16.634 --> 33:18.877
I will do. And this goes for the whole spectrum. 
Either I believe that either you grew up with the

33:28.223 --> 33:37.933
thought that, with the will to overcome hardships 
or you don't have it. And I think that's ingrained

33:38.533 --> 33:45.841
in your younger years and you follow through with 
it in your later years.

33:47.182 --> 33:57.032
How did y'all, you know, like if a guy was a cripple, 
how did, was there any way that you that the other

33:57.400 --> 34:05.892
patients would try to help him to get his morale up 
to show him that he could still be productive? Oh,

34:06.312 --> 34:07.915
yeah. I know when I was there, I had, there was a guy 
that had a train went over his legs and he lost both

34:07.935 --> 34:14.844
his legs. And filling out the menu, which you 
would, the food was very good at Brooks, and you

34:15.065 --> 34:26.901
filled out your own menu, what you wanted to select 
from And he was always asking me for my pen or

34:27.742 --> 34:35.091
pencil. I just, you know, after about the second 
day, I told him to get his own and keep it. And then I

34:43.140 --> 34:48.767
didn't let him use mine anymore. I would do or die. 
If he didn't want to fill out his menu, that was his

34:51.330 --> 34:53.833
problem. And I remember one guy, he got hit up on our 
guy, and our guy with both his legs gone right up the

34:55.636 --> 35:08.228
hip, he was asking for help. And our guy looked up at 
him and said, what do you think you are, cripple or

35:09.149 --> 35:17.337
something?

35:17.357 --> 35:24.124
And it's a lot different when you have a large group 
of severely injured people together because you

35:24.593 --> 35:31.164
can always look around and find somebody worse off 
than you are. It seems like y'all helped each other

35:31.184 --> 35:38.577
more than anybody else could. Oh yeah. Just by 
forcing each other to do things. That's just like

35:43.345 --> 35:50.196
in college when you get a rough instructor if you 
group together I had to work out the problems how to

35:50.463 --> 35:54.728
pass the course. It's a lot easier doing it by 
yourself. Yeah, I found that true in this one

35:58.632 --> 36:04.799
history class that I just had.

36:08.823 --> 36:19.515
Did you find that, back at Brooks, that being a 
Vietnam veteran made a difference in your

36:08.823 --> 36:19.515
relations with the hospital staff? No. If

36:20.467 --> 36:26.816
anything, we were preference. Being combat 
wounded could be preference over value, but

36:28.359 --> 36:39.615
not very obvious. As far as your rehabilitation 
programs, Did you ever have any encounter group

36:49.981 --> 36:53.525
programs?

36:56.029 --> 36:56.870
Initially, no.

36:59.653 --> 37:18.216
I know one thing that

36:59.653 --> 37:18.216
like when I found out that there were going to have 
fireworks were out Beach Pavilion where a lot of

36:59.653 --> 37:18.216
the people were and It was right next to the parade 
field, and twice a year they would have fireworks

37:19.242 --> 37:26.370
out there on the parade field. And I kept telling 
the staff that, you know, be sure to tell everybody

37:26.390 --> 37:34.739
there's going to be fireworks, because look out. 
And the first couple times they sloughed it off,

37:35.099 --> 37:44.750
and there was some real messes. Because the guy on 
the first fireworks go off and boy the first thing

37:47.947 --> 37:54.833
they do is get under their bed and it didn't matter 
whether they were in tractions or what. And there

37:56.015 --> 38:06.524
was some injuries caused from it and I don't know 
why they kept the fireworks right there, right

37:56.015 --> 38:06.524
next to Maine Hospital, but they did. Did you have 
very much contact with veterans of other wars that

38:08.486 --> 38:14.892
hadn't been in Vietnam? No, not a lot. Did, in your 
relations with veterans who have been through

38:19.655 --> 38:32.151
other wars, do you find that the Vietnam veterans 
had a different view of the military?

38:37.798 --> 38:47.991
Well, the normal, I say grunt, which means normal 
infantry or whatever, they Roy did because they

38:48.224 --> 38:53.932
thought it was a useless war and they were always 
thrown into it. When I was a voluntarily enlisted

38:53.952 --> 39:10.654
and I felt like I was doing good in Vietnam and I was 
serving a purpose and most of the soldiers did not

38:53.952 --> 39:10.654
feel this way. So I'm sort of oddball in that 
respect. How does the presence of, like in the VA,

39:18.397 --> 39:30.632
the presence of veterans from other wars, how do 
they affect you? Well,

39:30.652 --> 39:46.311
I wouldn't say that was a problem, but the problem 
is that the VA handles all veterans, whether they

39:30.652 --> 39:46.311
were in a war or not. And you take someone, well I 
knew there at Brooke we had this one guy and wasn't

39:46.898 --> 39:58.496
anything wrong. What happened was he got drunk in 
France and climbed a power pole and touched a hot

39:59.938 --> 40:10.013
wire and burned both his hands off. And when he got 
out of the military. He got no military retirement

40:15.405 --> 40:27.658
whatsoever, but he was 100% disabled by the 
Veterans Administration. I'm only 80% disabled

40:28.799 --> 40:41.914
by the Veterans Administration, and he has a lot 
more privileges than I do.

40:43.025 --> 40:55.357
It falls under the category, the first category 
that they have is service-connected or

40:43.025 --> 40:55.357
non-service-connected. His was 
non-service-connected, but yet he has more

40:55.377 --> 41:01.603
benefits than I do. And this I find fault with. And 
there's a lot of people in the VA hospital are

41:11.611 --> 41:13.593
non-service connected. And service connected 
means where you are injured in the line of duty or

41:15.435 --> 41:25.805
not, which can become quite touchy. What about 
veterans who receive the benefit, but who in

41:27.387 --> 41:37.097
reality really are not disabled? People such as 
General Curtis LeMay, who claimed to be disabled,

41:41.362 --> 41:52.357
but yet he still went on to get his pilot's license 
and flies privately and was also a prospect for

41:41.362 --> 41:52.357
vice presidential candidate. What is your 
feelings about that? It's a way that a lot of people

41:56.563 --> 42:03.612
get out paying extra income tax. It's a loophole in 
the income tax system which causes this. Unless it

42:07.598 --> 42:09.861
has nothing to do really with VA then. Oh, yes. 
Because if the VA finds him disabled, say 30%

42:11.264 --> 42:20.515
disabled, then 30% of his retirement pay is 
non-taxable.

42:24.300 --> 42:26.002
So what can I say about that? Do you think that's the 
fault of the Internal Revenue Service or the fault

42:26.282 --> 42:34.572
of the VA?

42:38.416 --> 42:56.758
I don't know where the fault lies, but if, say, he 
was 30% disabled, then

42:38.416 --> 42:56.758
cause in line of duty and so on, I think then he 
deserves it. But lots of times when, say, a general

42:57.339 --> 43:06.550
goes in for an examination like that, he gets this 
because he's a general. And rank has its

43:07.424 --> 43:11.849
privileges.

43:14.612 --> 43:25.204
While you were recuperating at Brooks, did you 
ever have very much exposure to the outside world

43:14.612 --> 43:25.204
as far as like passes and things? Oh yes. Was there 
no difficulty there? Normally not. Two or three

43:31.451 --> 43:37.178
times I got a thirty day convalescent leave. and 
sometimes I went home or just flew all over the

43:37.613 --> 43:43.903
country or whatever. And surprising as it may 
seem, almost every place I went I was, because to

43:45.445 --> 44:05.697
fly a military standby you have to do it in uniform, 
and I was well received by all the The only place

44:06.149 --> 44:12.275
that I wasn't well received was at Colorado 
Springs, Colorado. And probably that was because

44:13.116 --> 44:26.350
there were so many people there that were head to 
Vietnam that they didn't know how to take me. And

44:27.851 --> 44:34.418
when I was there I was on crutches without my 
prosthesis. Yeah, Green Belay, they didn't know,

44:35.242 --> 44:39.829
boy, how to take it. It's a little bit more 
personal. Do you remember what your parents'

44:45.677 --> 44:51.005
reactions were the first time they saw you after 
your injury?

44:54.751 --> 44:56.153
No, not really. Part of my injuries was I had 
complete amnesia and when I woke up in the hospital

44:57.247 --> 45:06.460
there at Clark Air Force Base, I didn't even know my 
own name. And I was not a good patient there because

45:08.984 --> 45:24.486
they were speaking basically Spanish there 
because it was in the Philippines and I got that

45:08.984 --> 45:24.486
confused with my Vietnamese if I was a prisoner of 
war in North Vietnam. The only thing I wanted to do

45:25.107 --> 45:31.195
was escape, and I was not a good patient.

45:36.002 --> 45:54.827
As

45:36.002 --> 45:54.827
far as your treatment went, what kind of 
medication did they have you on?

45:57.710 --> 46:11.871
Basically the only medication I was on was some 
mild painkillers as Aspirin as I needed unless I

45:57.710 --> 46:11.871
was in surgery or something and then I got heavy.
