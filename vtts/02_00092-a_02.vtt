WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:05.896
Pop Downard was a machine shop and Pop Fleming was a wood shop.

00:07.718 --> 00:14.225
Those were afternoon labs and we stayed awake in those, of course, but.

00:14.245 --> 00:16.148
Early on when you needed advice.

00:16.168 --> 00:23.816
Had your friend, Screamin' Al Nelson for history.

00:23.996 --> 00:27.440
Oh, describe him.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.042
Screamin' Al Nelson was a.

00:30.473 --> 00:35.300
A good history professor, but he had a lot of little quirks about him.

00:35.340 --> 00:42.169
His podium was on a six inch platform, wood platform.

00:43.931 --> 00:51.482
And so we'd put his chair on the platform and he'd come in and kick it off and kick it clear across the room to the windows.

00:53.024 --> 00:55.367
The windows were high so we didn't break any of the windows.

00:55.837 --> 00:57.198
He'd kick it clear across the room.

00:57.218 --> 01:22.145
We knew he'd do it, so we put it up there every day just to watch him kick it across, and then, so he taught the class, and most of his quizzes were essay, and the theory was that he'd take them to the fourth floor of the Rotunda, an academic building, and drop them, and the ones that hit first made A's, and the ones that floated made F's, because all he wanted was content.

01:22.225 --> 01:23.987
He never read them to know what,

01:25.098 --> 01:29.383
whether you answered a question or not, it was just a content thing with him.

01:30.645 --> 01:33.228
But he was, it was pretty funny.

01:33.248 --> 01:35.551
And then... Why was he nicknamed Screamin' Owl?

01:37.774 --> 01:39.476
Well, because he'd just scream half the time.

01:39.536 --> 01:43.201
You could ask him a question and he'd just yell at you.

01:43.221 --> 01:45.664
You know, kick the chair and then just yell at you.

01:45.684 --> 01:47.907
You know, so it was just a noisy room.

01:48.888 --> 01:52.793
And then we had Sigar Dan, the grade point man in rural sociology.

01:54.646 --> 02:00.554
He was always chewing on a little stub of a cigar.

02:00.574 --> 02:08.424
It was about two inches long, I guess, and he'd put it on the end of the chalkboard when he came in and get up and teach.

02:08.484 --> 02:14.212
And if you were there every day, you made an A. So it was the grade point man.

02:14.412 --> 02:16.114
Cigar Dan, the grade point man.

02:16.174 --> 02:17.997
Dan Russell, I believe his name was.

02:19.759 --> 02:20.620
But he was a...

02:22.912 --> 02:27.798
He was okay, passed us all anyway, so.

02:27.818 --> 02:29.520
Back to Screamin' Allen Nelson.

02:30.421 --> 02:37.810
What subjects or topics do you remember that he got most excited about?

02:37.831 --> 02:39.092
I think it was Roosevelt.

02:39.112 --> 02:43.538
It seemed like to me he was bad against Roosevelt.

02:44.078 --> 02:45.460
He didn't care too much for him.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.601
And we could mention his name.

02:46.641 --> 02:51.147
He spent the whole class hour talking about him.

02:52.325 --> 02:53.886
He wasn't in two favor.

02:54.327 --> 02:55.528
Who was the other one?

03:00.533 --> 03:02.755
Judge Stewart in business law.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.538
Describe him.

03:05.558 --> 03:08.400
Judge Stewart was a great professor.

03:10.162 --> 03:21.893
He was a practical professor because he would give you things and when he was teaching us contract law, he would say, now if you want to really remember this, here's what you think about.

03:22.666 --> 03:25.090
He who knowingly signeth hath no bitches.

03:26.892 --> 03:33.983
So I remembered that all these years, so it's easy to things, and he had a few other things like that, antidotes that he taught.

03:34.003 --> 03:49.045
But Judge Stewart would, in due respect to him, every now and then he would have a drink during the evening before class and have to wear rose-cluttered glasses to...

03:49.683 --> 04:01.537
class and then on occasion his wife would come in and teach the class because he wasn't able to make it that day and we got to walk his final.

04:03.739 --> 04:15.032
I took him one summer and in summer school the classes were from 7 to 1 or about 7 to 12 I guess and

04:17.408 --> 04:25.958
They had two, well they went all, excuse me, they started at 7 and went to 5, the day did for the staff.

04:26.819 --> 04:33.627
So there was one secretary come in at 7 and the other one would come in at 9.

04:34.088 --> 04:35.930
One get off at 3, one get off at 5.

04:37.972 --> 04:42.958
So we were taking our final at 7 and that secretary didn't come in so he couldn't get the final out of the safe.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.263
So he told us we could just take what we,

04:47.530 --> 04:49.213
what we had in the class and walked.

04:51.276 --> 04:56.084
So anyway, a few things like that happened on occasion.

04:56.104 --> 05:10.467
But anyway, he was a... During those early years, first year or two, to whom did you turn for advice about courses or anything else?

05:10.487 --> 05:11.428
Well, let's see.

05:15.695 --> 05:23.546
Like, I mean by changing my major, or what courses should I take next, or should I drop this one and add that one?

05:23.566 --> 05:27.091
The only one that really comes to mind was Dean McGuire.

05:27.131 --> 05:29.494
He was Associate Dean in College of Engineering.

05:30.876 --> 05:34.281
He was a very nice man and helped me out.

05:34.341 --> 05:35.743
If anybody helped me, he did.

05:35.863 --> 05:36.925
Was that Mickey McGuire?

05:36.945 --> 05:37.125
Uh-huh.

05:38.487 --> 05:44.976
And so I think he's the one that I primarily went to.

05:45.395 --> 05:49.761
when I had anything like that, and he helped me out quite a bit, so.

05:51.344 --> 05:56.732
You came up to begin school at the first of September or just before?

05:56.752 --> 05:57.974
I came in in January.

05:58.334 --> 05:59.836
I was what they called a frog.

06:00.057 --> 06:01.299
Oh, you came in January?

06:01.319 --> 06:01.419
Yeah.

06:01.519 --> 06:03.101
Where had you gone to school before?

06:03.121 --> 06:07.267
Well, I was just a semester late getting out of high school.

06:07.288 --> 06:13.497
You know, I got out of high school in December and then came up here in January, so.

06:13.517 --> 06:13.697
Oh, okay.

06:14.268 --> 06:18.653
All right, now then track really began then.

06:18.673 --> 06:26.602
Yeah, we were right out on the track at that time, and then the next September I was running with everybody.

06:27.864 --> 06:35.853
And then the next February I went over to the Corps, so I spent a year there in the track in Hart Hall and then spent the rest of the time.

06:36.033 --> 06:39.077
So when your dad brought you up here that first time,

06:39.057 --> 06:41.121
Yes, it was in the snow.

06:41.141 --> 06:42.083
It was in the snow.

06:42.103 --> 06:43.445
It was the snow of 49.

06:43.465 --> 06:43.946
Yeah.

06:44.026 --> 06:45.289
Yeah.

06:46.551 --> 06:55.648
And, okay, then describe the real track workouts and your internal landing.

06:57.164 --> 07:23.087
Well, like I say, Ray Putnam was the quarterback, up coach, and when we'd get out there at those days, we would have sprint training, and then we'd run the 300, and then he'd race us against each other on the 300, and then once or twice a week we'd race on the quarter mile against each other.

07:24.048 --> 07:24.528
And what was your event?

07:24.548 --> 07:25.669
The quarter mile.

07:27.438 --> 07:30.182
And I did pretty good in high school.

07:32.305 --> 07:37.512
I was running from a 49 to a 51 according to how good it was.

07:37.593 --> 07:52.294
And when I came up here, a guy named James Baker from Highland Park, I believe he was in Dallas, passed me like I was tied to a stump.

07:53.175 --> 07:56.820
Nice, great guy, you know, but classmate.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.325
But they just were so much faster.

07:59.486 --> 08:05.513
Builderback and Holbrook and all that class of seniors, and those guys were running 47s, 48s.

08:07.696 --> 08:08.858
But it was great experience.

08:08.898 --> 08:12.743
I met some very nice people that I wouldn't normally meet.

08:13.544 --> 08:18.891
But anyway, it was good, and I learned right away that I wasn't fast enough to do that, so.

08:19.992 --> 08:20.773
Okay.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.536
Colonel Andy.

08:22.556 --> 08:24.478
Colonel Andy, probably.

08:24.998 --> 08:28.864
without question, one of the nicest, politest men in the world.

08:29.064 --> 08:34.913
His son, Rusty, was in the class of 50 and was running a half mile.

08:36.375 --> 08:46.009
And his other son was a classmate of mine, was running a quarter mile, I think.

08:46.029 --> 08:47.732
Gosh, don't tell me, I forgot his name.

08:51.914 --> 08:54.037
I can't think of his first name right now.

08:54.057 --> 08:57.521
Anyway, he left after our freshman year and went to Annapolis.

08:58.242 --> 09:01.906
So I didn't get to know him, but Rusty hung around and graduated, so.

09:02.868 --> 09:06.652
Well, he goes to church with us, yeah.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.275
But he was just and his little wife, Ms.

09:09.376 --> 09:11.999
Anderson, was born with a smile.

09:13.481 --> 09:15.703
You never saw her without a smile.

09:15.804 --> 09:17.626
Just that type of lady, just.

09:17.646 --> 09:18.547
What was he like physically?

09:18.567 --> 09:19.148
What size?

09:19.328 --> 09:21.010
He was about 5'7".

09:21.952 --> 09:26.338
About 150 pounds, 160 pounds, 50 I guess, 40, somewhere in there.

09:26.939 --> 09:31.286
He was just well built but small, very small man.

09:31.786 --> 09:34.490
Now he got that title, colonel.

09:34.510 --> 09:35.972
Because he was a retired colonel.

09:36.433 --> 09:39.157
Had been what's coming out of the Corps.

09:39.457 --> 09:39.638
Uh-huh.

09:40.399 --> 09:47.429
And his father was a colonel and his father's father was a colonel or general or admiral or something.

09:47.489 --> 09:50.153
And so they're from a long line.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.103
Military.

09:52.383 --> 09:57.948
Were you all aware of any link between him and the 12th man?

09:57.968 --> 10:00.610
No.

10:00.670 --> 10:08.817
Turning it back on, about Colonel Andy, describe his coaching techniques and methodology.

10:08.937 --> 10:11.820
Well, to tell you the truth, I never worked under him.

10:12.921 --> 10:21.068
Ray Putnam was the distance coach, which I was always under, not under Colonel Andy.

10:21.048 --> 10:27.415
He had the hurdlers and the sprint people and those folks, and I never got to train under him.

10:27.595 --> 10:29.858
He was, Paul did, of course.

10:30.378 --> 10:35.044
Now, did folks like the Andersons live on campus still in 48?

10:36.625 --> 10:38.387
Describe that residential area.

10:40.189 --> 10:41.731
Well, it's kind of hard to describe.

10:41.771 --> 10:42.732
I don't really remember it.

10:42.752 --> 10:45.435
I didn't get over there.

10:47.440 --> 10:53.510
The houses were just being moved off about that time, but I'm not sure.

10:53.530 --> 10:56.654
I think he still lived on the campus then.

10:58.297 --> 11:01.642
He may have been at the South Gate by then, Colonel Andy.

11:01.943 --> 11:05.188
I'm not sure about that, so I never went to his home.

11:05.949 --> 11:09.735
A lot of them did, but I never did for some reason, so.

11:09.935 --> 11:13.502
All right, that first spring then, you're taking these basic courses.

11:14.705 --> 11:18.613
Then did you go home for the summer or take summer school?

11:18.633 --> 11:19.775
No, I went home for the summer.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.000
What did you do that summer?

11:22.020 --> 11:23.843
I'm not sure.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.529
I think I worked as an electrician's helper or something.

11:26.549 --> 11:27.010
I'm not sure.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.994
Did you feel good about your first semester?

11:29.254 --> 11:30.036
Oh, yeah.

11:30.016 --> 11:33.282
Just proud to be here and proud to be part of it.

11:33.302 --> 11:36.569
Folks were glad, you know, as parents would be.

11:36.589 --> 11:41.558
Had you already made some friendships which now you realize were lifelong?

11:41.779 --> 11:42.160
Oh, yeah.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.001
Oh, yes.

11:43.602 --> 11:44.825
Who were some of the dearest?

11:44.845 --> 11:46.788
Well, Paul Lemming is one of them.

11:46.809 --> 11:51.197
You know, my classmates, most of them.

11:52.595 --> 11:55.083
David Britt I met when I went over to the Corps.

11:55.143 --> 11:58.573
Been lifelong, or I say lifelong, from school day.

11:59.797 --> 12:02.385
But who else?

12:03.040 --> 12:05.904
Well, like I say, all your classmates that you grew up with.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.786
Bill Bless was a low hurdler.

12:09.248 --> 12:13.153
He was from Thomas Jefferson in San Antonio.

12:13.173 --> 12:14.275
He and Paul were the two.

12:14.795 --> 12:20.343
Lemming were the two probably best hurdlers in the state that year when they both came up here.

12:20.743 --> 12:23.547
Lows and highs.

12:28.471 --> 12:28.932
Who else?

12:28.952 --> 12:33.440
Well, I just, there's, I can't think of any names right now.

12:33.700 --> 12:43.999
All right, you come back then that first fall, in the fall of 49, is that right?

12:46.578 --> 12:49.305
Yes, right, fall of 49, right.

12:50.488 --> 12:53.014
We were sophomores then.

12:53.495 --> 12:54.458
All right.

12:54.478 --> 12:59.170
But were you, did you, you'd been, that's your second semester?

12:59.290 --> 12:59.410
Yes.

12:59.430 --> 13:00.272
Fall of 49?

13:00.292 --> 13:00.453
Uh-huh.

13:01.134 --> 13:02.999
Had you taken some courses somewhere else?

13:04.122 --> 13:04.182
No.

13:04.162 --> 13:07.849
All right, but in the Corps were you officially a sophomore?

13:07.869 --> 13:08.109
Yes.

13:08.770 --> 13:09.712
Okay.

13:10.173 --> 13:16.985
When you enter up here, like the September group was in a class four years from 48 was 52.

13:17.706 --> 13:19.690
Well, if you come in in September,

13:19.670 --> 13:22.593
then that's your class because it's during that year.

13:22.633 --> 13:25.376
So put me in the class of 52 with them.

13:26.117 --> 13:28.879
Describe what it was like to be a sophomore in the Corps.

13:28.899 --> 13:30.421
How was it different from being a freshman?

13:30.902 --> 13:37.008
It was a lot different because over in the Corps, we were the low man on a totem pole in the Corps.

13:37.048 --> 13:42.173
There were seniors, juniors, and sophomores because the class of 53 was still out on the annex.

13:43.675 --> 13:48.900
And so they shaped us up a little bit because the sophomores,

13:49.808 --> 14:00.658
who were then juniors, finally found somebody they could haze, or I shouldn't put that word in there, that they could speak to harshly, I guess.

14:00.678 --> 14:11.648
And they did have an occasion to get a board on occasion and give us a couple of three licks.

14:13.110 --> 14:15.031
What would be the causes of that?

14:15.472 --> 14:15.812
Of what?

14:16.953 --> 14:18.955
For what reason would they pull the board out?

14:19.677 --> 14:22.861
What they called it in those days was good bull.

14:26.365 --> 14:37.580
Because they had a good day in class, because they failed the test, because they passed the test, because they were out drunk the night before and they decided they'd just do it for good bull.

14:38.180 --> 14:40.183
And this usually occurred where and when?

14:40.518 --> 14:51.692
It usually occurred, in our outfit, it usually occurred at noon from the time we got back from class till the time we would fall in to March to Chao at noon.

14:52.734 --> 14:53.555
In where?

14:54.035 --> 14:54.596
In the hallway?

14:55.457 --> 14:57.720
No, in the junior's room.

14:58.761 --> 15:01.805
And did you bend over?

15:01.845 --> 15:04.128
No, you didn't bend over.

15:04.148 --> 15:07.993
You grabbed pooch and stood up against the bedpost.

15:08.581 --> 15:15.792
With grabbing pooch is what you do when you reach down and pull your pants tight against your butt.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.654
And you had your pants on.

15:18.055 --> 15:19.738
Oh, yeah.

15:19.758 --> 15:22.802
And what was the limit on the number of licks that anybody ever got?

15:22.822 --> 15:23.343
It was three.

15:23.363 --> 15:23.643
Three.

15:23.804 --> 15:24.825
Yeah, that was the limit.

15:25.246 --> 15:28.110
And the paddle was usually made was a what?

15:28.150 --> 15:33.698
Well, the one that they used on us most of the time during that year was a shaving down baseball bat.

15:34.179 --> 15:34.960
And...

15:36.256 --> 15:45.505
We had a junior in there that was a freshman All-American baseball player that understood how to use a baseball bat.

15:47.667 --> 15:52.192
And so it was very interesting.

15:52.392 --> 15:59.599
We had some juniors in there that the deal was if they didn't hit you very hard, you'd take some crackers and put it in your back pocket.

16:00.980 --> 16:05.605
And like they couldn't bust crackers, you know, they weren't strong enough to do.

16:07.525 --> 16:08.686
They didn't like that too much.

16:08.946 --> 16:10.067
But anyway, it was fun.

16:13.751 --> 16:16.213
But who's going to read all of this?

16:18.495 --> 16:19.656
Anybody.

16:19.677 --> 16:20.838
Okay, you can cut this out.

16:20.858 --> 16:22.199
Do you know what a fart off is?

16:22.419 --> 16:22.479
No.

16:22.499 --> 16:23.961
That's the only way I can explain this.

16:24.021 --> 16:26.243
No, I haven't heard of that one.

16:26.263 --> 16:30.687
A fart off is when you really insult somebody.

16:31.247 --> 16:32.909
I mean, when you really put them down.

16:35.051 --> 16:37.093
They call that a fart off, you know.

16:38.238 --> 16:47.189
Well, I made the major classic to a senior who was my CO's roommate.

16:49.733 --> 16:54.559
And it was like just a week after I got over there, I hadn't even seen him because he was either sleeping or in class.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.401
So I hadn't even seen him.

16:58.564 --> 17:03.570
So when we were in the John in the dorm, I whipped out to meet him in the head.

17:06.976 --> 17:07.617
Bad news.

17:07.817 --> 17:09.398
Oh, you're not supposed to do that in the job.

17:09.498 --> 17:10.179
No, no.

17:10.199 --> 17:13.302
Well, you just got through and then you... Oh, I see.

17:15.524 --> 17:16.005
Not good.

17:16.725 --> 17:18.867
Not a good practice.

17:18.887 --> 17:21.510
And I've never done that before and even to this day.

17:22.371 --> 17:25.934
If somebody at the stadium or somewhere, Harry, how you doing?

17:25.974 --> 17:28.056
I'd flinch, you know.

17:28.737 --> 17:31.319
I will do it, but I don't want to.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.962
But I pulled the major.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.005
coup of the year right there.

17:39.109 --> 17:41.214
And I never did it again.

17:41.494 --> 17:47.567
But anyway, that is, I mean, a major faux pas in that core area.

17:47.587 --> 17:48.469
All right.

17:48.489 --> 17:52.097
Well, to anybody if you just think about it, you know.

17:52.678 --> 17:52.778
Yeah.

17:53.078 --> 18:04.833
You all had all the, I mean, yeah, that fall of 49, you sophomores had a similar routine to what freshmen in other years on the campus would have had.

18:04.853 --> 18:05.334
Exactly.

18:06.996 --> 18:17.189
So we had to do everything the freshmen did, like at Christmas, we sang carols on each corner of the dorm.

18:17.790 --> 18:21.735
Our class, there were four, there were three outfits in there.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.062
A, B, and C infantry.

18:25.804 --> 18:31.412
So we'd pick a corner and then we'd move around and sing carol to the upperclassmen at Christmas.

18:33.574 --> 18:41.665
And of course we had to know by Thanksgiving

18:44.665 --> 18:54.740
We had to have met and know the names of everybody in the dorm, where they were from, and what they were taking from September to Thanksgiving.

18:56.503 --> 19:02.692
And you do that by looking at their card at night.

19:03.053 --> 19:05.877
You'd meet them and then you'd go by and look at their cards or something.

19:06.418 --> 19:09.002
And it was a senior privilege to lock your door.

19:10.282 --> 19:13.146
So that's when all the ground outs came at night, you know.

19:14.047 --> 19:18.172
You've had people tell you about that and the flood in the dorms and all that, I'm sure.

19:20.275 --> 19:40.120
But in my opinion, in those days, we had the bull ring that marched on Saturday from 1 to 5, get demerits, and you would, according to how many demerits, how many hours you had to walk, full dress uniform with a rifle, walk in a square out on the back drill field out there behind a cord arm,

19:40.623 --> 19:42.407
55 minutes and rest five.

19:45.012 --> 19:50.263
But most, if you had any demerits, it was usually for what?

19:51.164 --> 19:54.692
Or uniforms, bed not made, stuff like that.

19:55.814 --> 19:57.838
But just in my humble opinion,

19:58.662 --> 20:00.525
Although we wanted to go home every day.

20:01.286 --> 20:04.090
You'll hear that a lot too, you know.

20:04.110 --> 20:11.041
We didn't go home because we'd rather face the sophomores than our parents, than our daddy telling them we quit, you know.

20:11.061 --> 20:20.856
Those days we respected our parents and we wasn't going to, but so we,

20:24.869 --> 20:26.291
I forgot my train of thought there.

20:27.432 --> 20:31.416
You're talking about the drills and the routine and so forth.

20:32.637 --> 20:34.179
Let's jump to Colonel Boatner.

20:34.439 --> 20:36.441
Make believe that I never heard of him.

20:36.581 --> 20:40.886
Describe him physically and describe him as a CO.

20:42.207 --> 20:43.008
Colonel Boatner.

20:44.049 --> 20:53.239
Hayden L. Boatner was a medium-sized man with a staunch face.

20:54.046 --> 20:59.415
and a hard case.

21:02.340 --> 21:17.426
He was a general in the Army and slapped a guy, a service man, sort of like Patton, or did something like that like Patton.

21:18.307 --> 21:20.070
And so they busted him to Colonel

21:22.008 --> 21:25.898
and sent him to A&M as the Commandant of the Corps.

21:27.021 --> 21:27.924
I didn't know that.

21:27.944 --> 21:28.204
Yes.

21:30.330 --> 21:34.060
And I'll finish that part of the story.

21:34.441 --> 21:36.827
And during the Korean War,

21:37.718 --> 21:52.504
They called him and wanted to know, they told him if he wanted to go to Korea because they had that sit-down strike in Incheon or something, somewhere over there, and they couldn't get it corrected.

21:54.560 --> 21:59.286
So they called him and told him they'd give him a star back if he would go over there and correct it.

22:00.127 --> 22:07.916
So they asked him if he'd like to go over, and he said, I'll go anywhere where there's not a mother's club, is the story that I heard.

22:09.397 --> 22:13.042
But he was really something.

22:13.602 --> 22:15.845
Was he strong-willed with?

22:16.165 --> 22:17.367
Very strong-willed.

22:17.387 --> 22:21.732
He hated the Air Force because he was an Army man.

22:21.712 --> 22:25.940
A friend of mine, two of them in the class of 50, got in trouble one day and went in.

22:26.160 --> 22:39.564
He called them into his office and while he was chewing them out, he said something about the Air Force and hit his desk and broke the glass on his desk.

22:39.584 --> 22:43.551
He was so adamant about the Air Force.

22:47.176 --> 22:56.807
He, someone was walking down military walk, a couple of cadets, at 5 o'clock when he came out and had his jeep and he was headed home.

22:58.509 --> 23:04.856
And he got about a block away from him and stopped the jeep and backed up the whole block and stopped him.

23:04.876 --> 23:08.340
They didn't salute him, so he made them salute him.

23:09.962 --> 23:11.003
But that's the kind of guy.

23:11.023 --> 23:14.247
And then on the other hand, Bill Bless told me,

23:16.319 --> 23:25.052
that he saw him in a, he was getting out of an airplane in some country.

23:27.015 --> 23:41.837
It might have been, anyway, he was, Bill Bless was a pilot, and he was landing in an Air Force base where Colonel Boatner was changing commands or moving from one place to another, and he called him by his name.

23:43.302 --> 23:47.831
So he had a knack for remembering all of us that were here, you know, that had anything to do with it.

23:47.851 --> 23:49.975
Now he was not an Aggie by background, was he?

23:49.995 --> 23:50.296
No, no.

23:50.997 --> 23:51.137
No, no.

23:51.157 --> 23:52.159
I'm not sure where he went.

23:52.199 --> 23:54.744
I was going to say the academy, but I'm not sure about that.

23:54.764 --> 24:00.375
Did you all ever see, while you were students, did you ever see him soften up ever?

24:00.736 --> 24:00.836
No.

24:01.097 --> 24:02.039
He was always strong?

24:02.860 --> 24:04.804
Always strong.

24:05.105 --> 24:10.415
Mad because he was here and mad because he was busted and mad because he was in the Mother's Club.

24:10.475 --> 24:12.459
Did y'all have any nicknames for him?

24:12.659 --> 24:13.661
I've never heard one for him.

24:13.681 --> 24:14.262
I haven't either.

24:15.124 --> 24:16.747
Because it was all respect for him.

24:16.827 --> 24:18.089
It was Colonel Boatner.

24:18.109 --> 24:20.734
That's all it was.

24:20.714 --> 24:21.475
But I can't remember.

24:21.495 --> 24:23.619
I never heard anybody say anything outside of that.

24:23.899 --> 24:27.004
Now, you were in the new Corps area.

24:27.105 --> 24:28.126
Yes.

24:28.146 --> 24:30.029
How was it different from Hart Hall?

24:30.851 --> 24:33.796
Going to Cebisa and that was going to Duncan.

24:34.677 --> 24:34.777
Yeah.

24:34.797 --> 24:36.420
Well, going to Duncan, of course.

24:36.480 --> 24:42.370
We marched into Duncan and then we sat with our outfit and then it was sophomores, juniors, and seniors got to food.

24:42.951 --> 24:45.675
Seniors, juniors, and sophomores.

24:46.027 --> 24:49.452
And there were no short stopping anyone, you know, and hard haul.

24:49.472 --> 24:50.574
We just passed it around.

24:50.634 --> 24:51.315
Everybody took it.

24:52.116 --> 25:08.640
But it got to be all military when we got to Duncan, so it was a different setup, which we learned rapidly, because we had one junior that every time one of us sophomores would take something out of a dish, he'd say, that's okay, I didn't want it anyway.

25:09.601 --> 25:13.587
And then you couldn't remember whether he had it or whether he didn't have it.

25:16.216 --> 25:18.941
So anyway, it was fun.

25:19.743 --> 25:26.896
In the dining hall, how soon did you and your buddies learn all of the lingo, the nicknames for the food?

25:27.177 --> 25:27.958
It was pretty quick.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.385
Well, we had all the lingo we learned over here.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.188
I mean, they said all the lingo and everything.

25:33.849 --> 25:37.296
But so we learned all that pretty quick.

25:37.968 --> 25:42.714
Did you ever get in trouble at home when you forgot to use some of that at the table with your parents?

25:43.075 --> 25:44.316
No, because I didn't forget.

25:44.357 --> 25:48.182
No, I didn't do that.

25:48.202 --> 25:49.323
Because I've heard a few were.

25:49.664 --> 25:51.025
Yeah.

25:51.046 --> 25:55.071
I told my daddy that when we were together on occasion, but I didn't say it around my mama.

25:56.212 --> 26:00.899
Did you ever, in those early semesters, did you ever think about leaving A&M?

26:01.219 --> 26:01.900
Every day.

26:02.403 --> 26:11.516
Everybody thinks about it every day when they're sophomores or after you're when, you know, it just, well, you just have to stop and meet everybody.

26:11.537 --> 26:22.913
You know, you think you can't do it, but if you see somebody in your outfit and he's walking with three other people, you have to stop and go run and meet them as long as you're an old man like that.

26:24.776 --> 26:26.098
What kept you from leaving then?

26:27.479 --> 26:28.180
I told you.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.124
I wasn't going to go home and tell my daddy I was quit.

26:30.726 --> 26:36.257
You know, you just had respect for your parents and they didn't believe in you quitting, you know.

26:37.459 --> 26:41.267
And I say everybody wanted to quit every day.

26:41.287 --> 26:43.952
You know, it was just kind of a story.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.851
Did your outfit have a nickname?

26:46.412 --> 26:46.812
No.

26:46.972 --> 26:50.996
In those days, they didn't really have that many nicknames.

26:51.016 --> 27:00.244
You were in the quartermaster, or you were in infantry, A, B, C, or D, infantry, and that's the military science you took.

27:01.265 --> 27:02.406
I don't know how they have it now.

27:03.407 --> 27:09.893
You take infantry, but you're in some dog outfit or something.

27:10.153 --> 27:12.235
I don't understand all that over there now.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.277
It's gotten past me.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.178
I grew too old.

27:17.020 --> 27:27.229
That fall, describe for the first time your experiences with the routine of football weekends.

27:27.810 --> 27:31.333
What happened during the weekend and when and where and what did you all do?

27:31.413 --> 27:41.563
Well, you have to relate this to the fact that we didn't have any money, any cars, and every now and then

27:42.893 --> 28:09.708
If we did have a date, which I don't think I ever had one up here until maybe the senior ball or the... But anyway, some of the guys had dates up here and a lot of funny stories about blind dates and all and how after the game they'd walk around the big pillows at Kyle Field one way and the girl would walk around the other and never they met again.

28:09.808 --> 28:11.871
So, you know, that sort of thing.

28:13.370 --> 28:20.081
But anyway, we just, we marched into the football games and marched into the stands.

28:21.002 --> 28:25.289
It wasn't marching in like they do today and going back to the dorm and doing what you want to.

28:26.191 --> 28:35.125
And we also fought, we would practice on Thursday or Friday, farming the tea.

28:36.286 --> 28:44.081
on the field because the entire corps came out of the stands in those days and formed the T as opposed to the band doing it today.

28:45.444 --> 28:54.261
But we marched in, we had of course an athletic card, but we marched in, marched right around and tracked our seats and that's the way it was, you know.

28:54.427 --> 29:00.597
And of course sophomores with, or juniors with cigars yelling at you, blowing smoke in your face and all that kind of stuff.

29:00.617 --> 29:02.040
So it was all fun.

29:02.060 --> 29:05.565
Did they bring the freshmen in from the NX?

29:05.986 --> 29:08.089
They marched in with us.

29:09.312 --> 29:12.817
Did that make you sophomores feel temporarily superior?

29:13.198 --> 29:13.919
It did, right.

29:14.640 --> 29:18.747
And so we blew smoke in their face too, you know, it was one of those deals.

29:18.727 --> 29:19.928
So it was a lot of fun.

29:20.248 --> 29:29.217
Now the, that fall, the football team, let's see, was that, was Coach Norton gone?

29:29.778 --> 29:30.018
Yes.

29:30.939 --> 29:31.479
Steitler?

29:31.499 --> 29:33.121
Steitler was here, I think.

29:33.141 --> 29:35.983
Who were the, were there any football heroes?

29:36.924 --> 29:39.026
Just Bob Smith that I can think of.

29:39.487 --> 29:39.767
Oh, yes.

29:39.827 --> 29:42.309
Robert Smith from Lamar High School in Houston.

29:42.510 --> 29:42.810
Yes.

29:43.391 --> 29:46.033
And he was pretty good.

29:46.013 --> 29:51.559
Do you remember any football game stories, anecdotes you can record?

29:51.619 --> 29:52.120
No.

29:53.301 --> 29:55.543
Just the SMU game, of course.

29:55.563 --> 29:58.506
He ran wild in that game, one of those years.

29:58.566 --> 30:00.869
But I don't really remember too many of those.

30:00.889 --> 30:02.170
They say, oh, that was Doak Walker.

30:03.211 --> 30:03.912
And Kyle wrote.

30:04.853 --> 30:05.854
Well, they went to SMU.

30:05.874 --> 30:07.576
I'm talking about we beat them one year.

30:07.636 --> 30:13.202
Smith ran 297 yards that day or something, a godly amount of yards.

30:13.621 --> 30:16.064
I don't really remember any of those.

30:16.124 --> 30:21.190
We, the bonfire, we had to get out and work on the bonfire like everybody else.

30:22.731 --> 30:25.354
So that would have been your, 49, been your first year.

30:25.394 --> 30:27.697
Do you remember where the cut area was?

30:28.137 --> 30:29.719
No, I didn't have to go to the cut area.

30:30.020 --> 30:34.445
I was on the stack over here and then.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.687
It was south of Duncan or was it on the drill field?

30:36.707 --> 30:39.190
Yeah, that year it was south of Duncan because we were,

30:41.414 --> 30:42.276
No, it wasn't either.

30:42.296 --> 30:43.840
I think it was on a drill field.

30:43.860 --> 30:44.000
Okay.

30:45.283 --> 30:49.673
Because we were... How long did... We had to guard it all night long.

30:49.714 --> 30:50.836
We thought we had to guard it.

30:50.936 --> 30:57.712
But at that time, it was just a teepee type thing, so there wasn't any logs to move or just put the logs up.

30:57.732 --> 31:00.098
About how long did y'all work on it?

31:00.567 --> 31:01.388
Not very long.

31:01.728 --> 31:02.329
Two weeks?

31:02.349 --> 31:03.110
