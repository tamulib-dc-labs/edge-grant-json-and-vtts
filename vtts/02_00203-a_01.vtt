WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:03.449
And we're testing.

00:06.772 --> 00:09.836
Today is Wednesday, March 4. And I have the great 
pleasure and honor of being in Houston in the

00:11.037 --> 00:26.013
office of Mayo Thompson, class of 41, chatting 
with him about his memories of what it was like to be

00:11.037 --> 00:26.013
a student at Texas A&M. Important opening 
question. Why did you attend Texas A&M? Well, the

00:32.954 --> 00:37.840
reasons were more than two or three. First of all, 
it was at the time in the only school that I thought

00:38.741 --> 00:57.404
that I had a reasonable chance to attend because it 
was at the time a poor boy's school. In the four

00:57.424 --> 01:02.050
years that I was at A&M, starting in September 37, A 
room board and laundry never cost more than $30 a

01:02.857 --> 01:09.086
month. That was maintenance. A matriculation fee 
was $25 a semester. And $5.50, as I recall, a

01:17.538 --> 01:26.771
semester for medical and athletic past 
privileges. So they furnished you a uniform for

01:28.032 --> 01:31.277
two years, Didn't have to worry about buying a lot 
of clothes. And so that was one reason. I had no

01:41.501 --> 01:47.729
money, so if I'm going to go someplace, I've got to 
go where the least of charge is. And secondly, it

01:49.231 --> 02:01.146
was the all-male, all-military environment at 
A&M at the time appealed to me. I was active in the

02:02.003 --> 02:05.808
ROTC program in the Fort Worth schools. In junior 
high school, the highest rank you could get was

02:06.749 --> 02:10.954
captain. I was in junior high school two years, and 
I did that. Then I went to Paschal High School, and I

02:14.879 --> 02:25.272
was the cadet colonel of the Fort Worth ROTC 
school, all the high schools in Fort Worth when I

02:14.879 --> 02:25.272
graduated. So it was a natural thing for me, since I 
had this military bent to me, to go to A&M. I liked

02:31.980 --> 02:38.672
the idea of the military and of course there was no 
interruption. I got out of A&M on the 31st day of May

02:39.593 --> 02:45.223
1941 and didn't go in the army until the next day. So 
I was on active duty for five years so I really

02:45.884 --> 02:56.142
literally wore a uniform from the time that I was 13 
years old to the time I was 26 years old. Did you

02:56.459 --> 02:58.962
visit the campus before you went to enroll? I'd 
never been on the campus, not a single time. I took a

03:04.029 --> 03:07.674
midnight chair car out of Fort Worth, and the 
ticket cost $3.30. And my mother had no car, so we

03:08.115 --> 03:21.994
rode down to the train station in a taxi with my 
grandmother's old steamer trunk roped on the back

03:08.115 --> 03:21.994
of the trunk of the taxi. And the train left the 
station at 11.30. and got into College Station

03:25.737 --> 03:32.223
around 5, 5.30 in the morning and stopped a goodly 
number of times. And when I got there at the old

03:32.943 --> 03:38.208
train station, that was the first time that I had 
been on that campus. It was right in the heart of the

03:39.709 --> 03:43.953
Depression, of course. And I had with me my high 
school transcript, my grandmother's old steamer

03:43.973 --> 03:55.423
trunk with all of my belongings in it, and $100 in 
cash that I had borrowed from a local businessman

03:55.758 --> 03:59.463
in Fort Horton. I told my mother the night before, I 
said, well, I'll see you in four years. But I had not

04:03.890 --> 04:07.155
the slightest idea it would not be four days. But 
when I got there, they took me in and got me a job.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.169
What was your job? Well, the first job I had, I 
worked at the YMCA and then had a job in the

04:26.133 --> 04:27.214
Association office. And

04:28.996 --> 04:38.864
it was summer work that made it possible to make a 
building of it. Describe the campus physically

04:38.985 --> 04:43.208
when you arrived. What buildings were there? What 
did it look like?

04:50.655 --> 04:56.140
Well, of course there was nothing on the west side 
of the railroad track. farmland. The dairy was

04:57.721 --> 05:01.224
over there, as I recall. Even the vet school was 
over on the east side. And Frances Hall, part of

05:03.746 --> 05:08.930
Cadet Laura then, was heavy. Go out and meet 
Frances Hall and tell us when you met her. Looking

05:13.594 --> 05:19.700
for a person, of course, was a little difficult 
since it was a building. The campus was austere, if

05:19.740 --> 05:23.323
there was any question about it. There was no 
Memorial Student Center. The YMCA was where you

05:26.393 --> 05:31.720
met people if anybody there was to meet. There was 
on the campus Aggieland Inn down across from

05:32.460 --> 05:43.714
Sabisa and not too far from the post office down at 
Clark Gate. They had a few hotel rooms there, and

05:43.734 --> 05:48.380
they had a dining room. And those families that 
could afford it and came, they would more often

05:48.400 --> 05:53.987
than not stay there. There were no hotels around, 
at least none that I'm aware of. And they would stay

06:00.458 --> 06:03.603
at A-Land Inn, I must say. My mother was on the 
campus one time in four years. She came down for

06:07.589 --> 06:11.455
Mother's Day my senior year. Incidentally, at the 
time, we met that day at Kyle Field.

06:21.997 --> 06:26.241
I delivered the Mother's Day address that year. 
And I spoke about the coming war in May of 41. And Dr.

06:33.507 --> 06:34.508
T.O. Walton said that he had heard countless 
Mother's Day addresses. He said, I've never heard

06:39.172 --> 06:47.220
one where the mothers were told to be prepared for 
their sons to go to war.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.221
There wasn't much to it. Highway 6 was a two-lane 
road. Freshmen couldn't leave the campus, saved

06:52.540 --> 07:14.271
by permission of their units, commanders, and 
even then, and going home on the weekends was

06:52.540 --> 07:14.271
absolutely out of the question until 
mid-semester when you got your first grades,

06:52.540 --> 07:14.271
which you posted on your door.

07:18.897 --> 07:19.999
Hazing was was very much

07:20.941 --> 07:27.348
in vogue in those days. Describe those events that 
today would be identified as hazing. Well, it

07:33.554 --> 07:41.282
varied between, there were 54 units on the campus. 
There were six regiments. And those six regiments

07:43.384 --> 07:48.670
were divided into 54 batteries, troops, or 
companies, depending on which of the combatant

07:49.308 --> 07:54.033
branches of the Army that you belonged to. It was 
only Army ROTC at the time. It depended. It

07:59.799 --> 08:00.339
depended. Each unit varied to some extent. For 
example, a freshman was never touched with a board

08:03.522 --> 08:07.466
in my outfit. Never. And what was your outfit? I was 
in G Coast. Did it have a nickname?

08:15.715 --> 08:17.897
Like later, I would hear about Spider D. Did you all 
have a... No. Okay. No, not that I recall. There was

08:24.310 --> 08:30.379
a board that was in some use for a long time called 
Big G. Looked like a canoe pilot. But go back. You

08:31.801 --> 08:34.184
were about to tell me about the reunion of your 
unit. Well, the hazing was the sophomores trained

08:34.284 --> 08:40.913
the freshmen. And they used to wear a room orderly. 
Even a sophomore had a room orderly. Seniors had

08:47.712 --> 08:48.794
two. You went to the post office. You got the 
upperclassman's mate. You got his laundry

08:54.502 --> 08:55.864
together. You ran details for him. You did 
everything for him. A senior could just holler

08:59.890 --> 09:05.598
out, freshman, and every freshman that was not in 
class had to come to the room. But that was called

09:06.539 --> 09:10.024
general fish call. Others, juniors and 
sophomores, had to call freshmen by name to get

09:10.044 --> 09:15.913
them to come and do something. You duck walked, you 
did push-ups. They aired you out at 11 o'clock at

09:20.885 --> 09:26.952
night, made you spend the night in the woods. They 
harassed you considerably, cadet lower. You

09:33.761 --> 09:36.764
served the upperclassmen in the mess hall. You 
walked in the street. The freshmen were not good

09:39.868 --> 09:43.673
enough to walk on the sidewalk. And in my outfit, 
they called sophomores second-year fish. They

09:48.873 --> 09:51.777
didn't think very much of it. You really didn't 
begin to enjoy corps life or life at A&M until your

09:51.797 --> 09:58.846
junior year. And then seniors, no matter what 
their position in the corps was, whether they were

10:00.228 --> 10:09.520
the corps commander or a second lieutenant, a 
senior was a senior was a senior. And considerable

10:11.523 --> 10:14.487
authority vested in them. We had the first court 
trip that I went on was when we played Rice in

10:16.188 --> 10:25.357
Houston in September, I mean in the fall of 37. And 
after we had our parade here. How did you get down to

10:30.883 --> 10:33.085
Houston? Well, those that could afford it came on a 
train and the rest of us hitchhiked because there

10:33.105 --> 10:41.033
were no cars that were allowed. Seniors were 
permitted automobiles and maybe 10 or more

10:41.173 --> 10:45.537
seniors in the whole student body, and they 
couldn't keep them on campus. So you got a ride. In

10:52.210 --> 10:57.240
any event, we were, after the parade was over, the 
sophomores... Wait, where'd y'all gather? Where

10:58.883 --> 10:59.905
was the parade? Well, it was down Main Street here 
in Houston, just like it still is to this day. You

11:04.314 --> 11:05.196
gathered and Well, I forget now where the assembly 
point was, but we marched from south to north. Oh,

11:13.706 --> 11:15.769
south to north. As my recall, and turned on Texas 
Avenue and went up Travis Street, but I don't

11:15.789 --> 11:23.680
remember the exact route of the march. Then Rice 
Stadium was at the corner of University and Main,

11:25.182 --> 11:32.532
and they had some little ticket booths out there. 
There was one man that could sit inside one of those

11:32.553 --> 11:35.757
booths. And when I got out there and other 
freshmen, there was a massive group. And some

11:45.010 --> 11:52.157
sophomore said, don't worry about the ticket. 
We're going to push the fence now. We're going to go

11:54.720 --> 11:57.222
in a big cycle on the fence. And we're not going to go 
through the gates. We're going to push the fence

11:59.524 --> 12:01.927
now. This was some sophomore's idea of a great way 
to go into the ballgame. And so the time was set, now

12:07.090 --> 12:14.739
I don't remember how long before the game was to 
start, that we were supposed to push the fence

12:07.090 --> 12:14.739
down. And easily do it, of course. We used to pick up 
automobiles in front of the YMCA and move them from

12:17.543 --> 12:22.709
the steps when we were getting ready to have Yelp 
practice. Put them behind a tree over there. Had to

12:24.992 --> 12:26.915
have a wrecker service come out and get them out. 
Whatever.

12:30.299 --> 12:37.047
About five minutes or so, ten minutes before we 
were just pushed the fence down, a senior So I can

12:37.364 --> 12:40.288
see him to this day standing up there. He just had 
boots on. And in those days, we had whistles. And

12:46.656 --> 12:51.523
they were all chained, and they had them hooked 
under our blouse pockets on the left.

12:54.827 --> 12:56.870
Whistle-bullet. And in those days, instead of 
calling corps attention, it was called battalion

12:56.890 --> 13:01.536
attention. That's the way they did it in the mess. 
when they wanted everybody to stop eating except

13:03.706 --> 13:07.250
seniors, they would keep eating. Called the 
battalion to attention and everything got as

13:08.752 --> 13:16.020
quiet as you can imagine with a senior standing up 
there. And he said, all right freshmen, all right

13:16.040 --> 13:20.185
sophomores, line up. We're going through the 
gates. And he was held down off the top of the little

13:24.870 --> 13:28.795
ticket booth. And we went through the gates. No 
fence pushed down. We went through the gates.

13:34.377 --> 13:40.885
Seniors said,

13:34.377 --> 13:40.885
line up, freshmen, line up. We were going through 
the gates. And that was the end of it. It just shows

13:44.209 --> 13:46.252
you the discipline.

13:49.076 --> 13:53.161
There were regular catch-out hitchhiking posts. 
And if you got upstream from that, that was a no-no.

13:58.187 --> 14:00.510
And you could drive by there, and if you saw 
anybody, that was ahead of the regular catch-out

14:01.216 --> 14:05.643
bar. You just tell them, get your bag, go out to 
wherever, and they'd pick up their bags and move. I

14:13.595 --> 14:18.842
only saw that two or three times, but I had a senior 
court in those days. As you went from Fort Worth to

14:19.203 --> 14:25.232
College Station and back, normally where did 
Where was the hitchhiking spot? Okay, it was over

14:27.435 --> 14:32.261
on Highway 6 near what is now University 
Boulevard. Eastgate? Eastgate. Okay. All right,

14:34.944 --> 14:36.686
now where in Fort Worth then? It was a Catholic 
school out at the south end of Fort Worth. I think it

14:41.271 --> 14:43.013
was called OLV. I don't remember Our Lady of 
Victory, but it was a small girls' Catholic school

14:43.214 --> 14:53.886
with commodious grounds, and that's where one 
stayed in. So you hitchhiked for four years. Yeah,

14:56.552 --> 14:57.753
I had no car. And did you or any of your friends ever 
have any bad experiences hitchhiking? No. Did you

15:04.439 --> 15:05.419
ever hear of any? No, never. No, you had your bag, 
and in those days they had big A&M stickers.

15:12.065 --> 15:14.387
Everybody just had one on their bag, and you'd go 
out there. The problem wasn't getting picked up.

15:19.011 --> 15:20.933
The problem was there weren't any cars. There was 
no traffic on that two-lane road. between Houston

15:24.173 --> 15:25.175
and Waco. Now, with straight face, I ask you this 
question. Well, what did you wear when you were

15:27.979 --> 15:31.285
hitchhiking? You wore the same thing you wore on 
that campus, that uniform, of course. Let's see.

15:36.834 --> 15:41.983
Tell me, we were on hazing a while ago. Give me some 
other details of freshman life routine. Well,

15:47.892 --> 15:50.637
aside from running details for upperclassmen, 
And always you kept your door open after call to

15:51.528 --> 15:59.379
quarters and before tabs you had to have your door 
open. It was true of sophomores as well in my

15:59.399 --> 16:01.622
outfit. And a junior was a hall monitor and you had 
to be at your desk and look like you're studying or

16:02.624 --> 16:09.774
studying. What were the forbidden dorm room 
activities? Well, of course, there wasn't any

16:15.760 --> 16:19.187
hell racing in the dormitories at the top. Could 
you smoke in your room? Sure. Okay. Sure. Could you

16:22.474 --> 16:24.699
drink alcoholic beverage in your room? No, that 
was, I'm not saying it wasn't done, but it was not

16:24.979 --> 16:29.569
supposed to be done. Okay. Could you? We weren't 
supposed to have any on the campus. Could you have a

16:34.138 --> 16:35.782
girl in your room? No. I'm not saying it didn't 
happen, but you were not supposed to. All right.

16:41.737 --> 16:45.322
What about some of the pranks, jokes, good bull? 
Well, the pranks is airing you out and making you

16:45.342 --> 16:49.408
spend the night in the woods. Another is drowning 
you out. In the spring and before the summer would

16:51.070 --> 17:03.207
come, the campus was littered with mattresses 
because of the drown-out time. And where a group

17:03.227 --> 17:06.912
would get together and get some buckets and fill 
them with water. and you just enter into this room

17:07.246 --> 17:13.792
in the dead of night, and while they're in bed 
asleep, you drown them out. All right. Who was

17:15.494 --> 17:17.476
normally the victim of a drownout? Everybody. Oh, 
so it wasn't just sophomores? No, no. Now, would

17:23.141 --> 17:25.403
you ever drown out a senior? Yes. Ah. Yes. Was it 
normally within your outfit? Normally.

17:33.171 --> 17:33.591
Normally. Can you think of any almost 
one-of-a-kind pranks, tricks, jokes? Well,

17:40.211 --> 17:44.917
there was fish day on the 1st of April. In those 
days, freshmen had white stripes on their left

17:46.039 --> 17:54.871
sleeve, as I recall, showing that they were 
freshmen, because that was the only thing

17:46.039 --> 17:54.871
different between them and a sophomore. The 
uniforms were the same. But you take your fish

17:57.054 --> 17:59.697
stripe off on the 1st of April, and you'd go out to 
Fish Tank, Fish Lake, I forgot what it was called,

18:00.892 --> 18:08.801
and you'd usually have a can of beer. Where was 
that? Well, it was out west of the railroad tracks.

18:14.287 --> 18:16.450
I can't remember exactly now where it was. And you 
spent the day out there, and it was pretty rowdy. As

18:22.076 --> 18:23.518
a matter of fact, very much so. But you were then 
accepted there. The sophomores quit calling you

18:28.583 --> 18:31.607
fish. You were a month away from being through the 
semester or two months, April and May, because we

18:31.988 --> 18:44.204
didn't usually get out until early June in those 
days, as you know. As a freshman, how were you

18:44.705 --> 18:54.138
indoctrinated with the routine of being a 
freshman and whipping out and all that? How did

18:54.278 --> 18:55.159
that come about? Well, it just was done locally by 
the sophomores. In your outfit? In your outfit.

19:01.838 --> 19:06.485
Alright, you came and what did you think your major 
was going to be and why? Well, I'd always wanted to

19:06.925 --> 19:15.678
be a lawyer so I took what was then called a pre-law 
course. I only had planned to stay at A&M for two

19:15.879 --> 19:22.789
years because one could then go over to Austin to go 
to law school. And you get a BBA and an LLB in five

19:23.090 --> 19:29.496
years. So that was my intention. It just so 
happened that my sophomore year in my outfit, I won

19:34.561 --> 19:44.971
the best drill medal, which meant that I was likely 
to be the first sergeant my junior year, which I

19:34.561 --> 19:44.971
was. So having won that medal, I decided, well, I 
think I'll just stay. The fact of the matter is, I

19:50.175 --> 19:52.978
had an opportunity to go to West Point. I got a 
letter in between my freshman and sophomore year.

20:00.901 --> 20:13.575
I had made earlier indications to my congressman 
of an interest and I got this announcement that a

20:00.901 --> 20:13.575
test was going to be given at a particular place and 
I didn't even go. Do you remember what courses you

20:13.775 --> 20:17.198
took as a freshman? Yes, English,

20:17.219 --> 20:23.185
chemistry, from a man to be ultimately the 
chancellor of A&M. Yeah, talk about him as a

20:30.143 --> 20:32.767
faculty member, teacher. Well, of course, I guess 
he taught in those years everybody ever went to

20:33.428 --> 20:38.415
him. I told him, I found me, I got him at a time when he 
was in a generous mood. I made a B in freshman

20:44.143 --> 20:48.109
chemistry.

20:49.793 --> 20:53.717
His teaching style, what was it like? Well, of 
course, big classes. We had a big amphitheater.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.505
Must have had 250 in the class. And then you had lab. 
So there wasn't anything really close and

21:02.427 --> 21:05.911
personal about it. But was he boring in class? No, 
he wasn't. No. The subject was boring to me. I hated

21:11.737 --> 21:15.081
chemistry. I hated it. Remembering balances or 
whatever. H2O was an easy one because it had a two

21:19.072 --> 21:24.698
and there was only one and the O had none. But it was 
not anything that appealed to me at all. Did he have

21:30.184 --> 21:31.405
a nickname? I don't remember that he had one.

21:37.131 --> 21:38.452
English, chemistry, what else?

21:43.738 --> 21:47.762
Took algebra.

21:48.198 --> 21:50.140
I'm talking about a liberal arts student now. Do 
you remember who? Oh, I have no idea. History? The

21:54.925 --> 21:57.167
fact of the matter is, this was my minor. I majored 
in economics, a minor in history. And I had a

22:02.072 --> 22:06.577
history course. And I believe an economics course 
as well. Then you took BOLTACS, military science

22:09.981 --> 22:17.108
and tactics, which was a one-hour course your 
freshman and sophomore year. three hours your

22:17.712 --> 22:19.555
junior and senior year. And it was compulsory for 
the first two, as you know. And that consisted of

22:24.283 --> 22:30.973
one hour classroom and then three hours drill 
time, one day a week. Plus,

22:31.514 --> 22:43.013
in those days, everybody carried 18 hours.

22:43.774 --> 22:45.036
I visited with my two saw raw students, and one of 
them was taking 12 hours, and the other one was

22:45.590 --> 22:49.736
taking 15. And I said, y'all plan on graduating in 
five years? And they said, yes. That's the norm

22:54.963 --> 22:56.305
nationally. I understand. And I have a hard time 
shaking hands with it. If I told my mother, I said,

23:00.451 --> 23:04.898
I'll see you in five years, she would say, well, 
you're going to do that other year. And she had a

23:04.958 --> 23:07.001
third grade education. You went to school, and you 
went for four years. Mm-hmm. And I can remember the

23:11.915 --> 23:16.119
engineers and those guys taking 21, 22 hours a 
semester. I graduated with a surplus of hours. Not

23:20.663 --> 23:23.866
a surplus of grade points, but a surplus of hours. 
Yeah, you all did have grade points. Yeah, we did.

23:27.809 --> 23:37.038
You got three for an A, two for a B, and one for a C, and 
nothing for a D. Class attendance. Did you and your

23:37.138 --> 23:41.702
classmates go to class regularly? supposed to, 
and the reason for it is that if you had three

23:41.851 --> 23:52.905
allowable cuts for a three-hour course, if you 
went beyond that, you got penalized on your grade

23:41.851 --> 23:52.905
point. So you just were self-harmed. Describe for 
me, if you can, the routine of a day. What time did

24:00.435 --> 24:01.496
you get up? What happened during? If you got up, if 
you were a freshman, of course, you got up before

24:02.638 --> 24:06.583
everybody. And you went outside and had Yale 
practice for your outfit. Then you came back in,

24:09.948 --> 24:11.911
you cleaned your own room. Then you cleaned 
somebody else's room. And then you got ready to go

24:15.195 --> 24:16.797
to breakfast. And in those days, we marched to 
meals. And you lined up to march at about what time?

24:22.264 --> 24:23.065
Oh, I don't remember. The classes started at 8 
o'clock. So it was around 7.15, perhaps,

24:25.368 --> 24:28.512
something like that. Who was responsible for 
waking the group up in your dorm? The freshmen just

24:32.176 --> 24:36.221
took care of one another. You had nobody else 
looking after you. Nobody blew a whistle or

24:37.944 --> 24:39.686
anything? No. No. Right then. All right. So 
classes? Eight to 12 and one to five. And most of

24:48.787 --> 24:50.009
your classes? And Saturday, eight to 12. Most of 
your classes were held in what, where? Well, where

24:54.996 --> 25:00.144
most of my classes were in the academic building 
and in the old chemistry building. Well, I took

25:00.745 --> 25:02.488
biology as well. And that was in an old building. I 
can't remember the name of it. Science Hall. Huh?

25:08.216 --> 25:08.777
Science Hall. I'll bet. Well, an old red brick 
building, as I remember. Just south of Academic.

25:15.052 --> 25:15.392
Yes. The president's home is made of those bricks 
today, turned around. And

25:21.902 --> 25:25.628
let's see. I'll tell you about Haysing. It was done 
clandestinely, this board business. I can

25:34.181 --> 25:37.566
remember my junior year, first sergeant in the 
outfit. And something had happened, and I don't

25:39.807 --> 25:44.032
know whether the seniors were upset. Seniors 
didn't waste their time

25:44.993 --> 25:52.041
using the board on the sophomore. If they used it at 
all, it was on the junior. And the juniors on the

25:55.144 --> 26:00.951
sophomore, if something wasn't going right. But I 
was sitting out, and we were in Mitchell Hall. We

26:05.256 --> 26:06.237
were in Mitchell. Bazell Goodwin and Hart. The 
Coast Artillery Regiment was the third largest

26:09.156 --> 26:12.321
regiment on the campus. So we were all right next to 
the Y's. The hospital is there now. They had steep

26:17.809 --> 26:22.777
steps going up, and I was up at the top. And either 
Colonel Hill or Colonel Hollinshead came by. They

26:28.666 --> 26:32.692
were the two tactical officers for the Coast 
Artillery. Both A&M men.

26:36.406 --> 26:42.612
And you could hear the boards popping. And of 
course, when I saw Colonel, I got up and saluted.

26:46.115 --> 26:47.256
And you could hear it. And he said, well, 
everything's quiet around here. Good night,

26:53.502 --> 26:55.323
Colonel. Salute. I have my senior year in 
preparation for RV weekend.

27:08.671 --> 27:15.940
I had been appointed by a couple of my classmates 
when we went across the river in the 14 mile trip and

27:08.671 --> 27:15.940
bought some white hard scotch. And I had it laid out 
in a drawer that was part of the storage room, the

27:16.640 --> 27:26.051
clouded storage facility for the room. And 
Colonel Hornshead came in on an inspection. And he

27:29.796 --> 27:33.480
pulled out a drawer in there, which is my senior 
year. There was a board line in there, and he closed

27:33.832 --> 27:39.841
that, pulled out this next door, and there was 
whiskey. He said, well, everything looks neat

27:40.862 --> 27:42.565
around here. On RV initiation, 60 juniors in the 
company and 60 seniors. Then there are only 60

27:52.380 --> 27:55.885
seniors, and you don't have 60 juniors. And you get 
invited. And the hazing took place in the

27:59.070 --> 28:02.775
horseshoe that Kyle beat. And senior RVs walk 
across the campus on a Sunday morning with the

28:04.561 --> 28:11.209
boards in their hand. And you know how that 
horseshoe is. A senior here and a senior here. And

28:18.338 --> 28:21.922
you come through and each one of them bangs you 
three times. Each junior gets banged six times.

28:24.225 --> 28:28.130
Six times by each of the 60 seniors. Each junior 
gets hit six times by these two seniors. then six,

28:34.548 --> 28:38.853
then six, and when you get to the end, you're 
bloody. It wasn't near bloody, you were bloody.

28:44.681 --> 28:51.289
You wore one pair of trousers and one pair of 
shorts, period, paragraph. And I've seen guys

28:53.232 --> 29:02.023
just step over on the side of the line and vomit, get 
up and get back in the line and finish. Well, it was

29:03.083 --> 29:07.669
terribly, terribly punishing. But that was just 
the part, the morning session. And the afternoon

29:10.252 --> 29:17.040
went down to the old rodeo, where they had rodeos, 
as it calls them, type things. And there they

29:17.060 --> 29:19.202
stripped you down naked. Are you talking about the 
pavilion? The pavilion, whatever it's called.

29:22.907 --> 29:25.690
Right there, near Cushing Library. Yeah, that's 
correct. It used to have some stables along there,

29:27.352 --> 29:31.437
where they kept some quarter horses. And you'd 
bend down and they'd put wintergreen in the back of

29:32.969 --> 29:40.738
your legs, at your knees. And they dipped raw 
oysters in asperity and tied string around them.

29:49.889 --> 29:55.296
And you'd lie in there and you'd open your mouth and 
they'd take it out and you'd swallow it and they'd

29:49.889 --> 29:55.296
pull it out. And then you ran some races and in the 
meantime you were so sore Good

30:02.483 --> 30:05.907
for you. Strangest thing, nice.

30:12.276 --> 30:13.097
No, you've got to flip. You've got to put the lock 
on.

30:19.966 --> 30:21.448
Now check and see if you can turn it. No, no, no, no. 
Don't put the key in. It was a grievous, grievous

30:23.570 --> 30:30.239
amount of pacing. It was barbaric. Now this is all 
in one day? All in one day on a Sunday. In April? In

30:36.540 --> 30:38.202
April. Then you go back to your outfit and you put on 
your white uniform. And you go down to Sabisa Hall

30:44.869 --> 30:48.412
for dinner. And you can't sit. I was going to say, 
how did you... Well, you just, and you go to class on

30:50.654 --> 30:56.360
Monday and you can't sit. And of course, when they 
see you just easing down or And the professors, of

31:01.968 --> 31:03.630
course, know. And

31:05.874 --> 31:10.039
I look back on that. I've told very few people about 
it. Of course, Aggies know about it in my day. I

31:15.227 --> 31:16.989
don't know what they do now, if anything. It was 
barbaric. It was meant to do whatever, and it did.

31:25.087 --> 31:32.109
But those were the outstanding, to be in the RVs, 
was the cream of the Corps of Cadets crop. We like to

31:32.330 --> 31:35.600
think so. We like to think so.
