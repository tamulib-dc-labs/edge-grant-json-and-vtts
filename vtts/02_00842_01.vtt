00:13.210 --> 00:33.576
This is an interview with Mrs. Bertha Moore by 
Larry W. Cruz on April 15, 1976,

00:13.210 --> 00:33.576
at the LaSalle Retirement Home at the corner of 
West 27th at Main in Bryan, Texas.

00:37.981 --> 00:40.364
So tell me a little bit more about Japan. Well, 
uh... I was born, you want me to tell you when I was

00:43.535 --> 00:45.557
born? Yeah, tell it, when you were born. I was born 
at about two miles, I used to say I discovered

00:46.699 --> 00:59.635
America, about two miles northeast of Bryan in a 
little neighborhood they called Woodville. And

01:01.337 --> 01:12.090
we moved to Bryan and moved into a, it was kind of 
like a mining town hotel. was just across the

01:12.509 --> 01:16.994
street west of the First National Bank. And it was a 
two-story outfit. One night, one fellow,

01:21.619 --> 01:27.907
somebody was climbing the post to get free 
lodging, you know. But we got, my father, mother

01:28.828 --> 01:32.352
got out, and they got him. He come on through, and we 
seen him back downstairs, you know. And we had...

01:43.458 --> 01:49.004
Well, the room and board was very cheap, if I 
remember correctly. It was $20 a month, you know,

01:49.024 --> 01:51.347
for room and board. We didn't stay there very long. 
And one thing about our family, we have lived on

01:54.630 --> 02:00.757
Bryan Street ever since we've been in Bryan. 
Really? When we first moved to town, we moved to

02:02.158 --> 02:05.001
this hotel. And then we gave it, when we wanted to 
get away from the hotel business, So we moved north

02:12.314 --> 02:17.300
on Bryan Street at a little place. The old man had a 
cabinet shop in the corner of the yard. And we

02:21.265 --> 02:26.011
children spent most of our time in the cabinet 
shop. And he let us use all of his tools and

02:27.132 --> 02:29.836
everything. Then my father bought a house across 
the street. Dr. Hall lived there. And he sold his

02:36.364 --> 02:41.410
house and moved into Bryan, further into Bryan. 
And we bought that house. And then when we got rid of

02:44.316 --> 02:51.065
that house, we moved to South Bryan, 700 South 
Bryan. It's in the house right next door to the

02:51.806 --> 02:57.674
woman's old building, the woman's club old 
building there. And then when Mr. Moore and I were

02:58.475 --> 03:06.746
married, we lived across the street here from the 
Missouri Pacific Depot. Yeah, I know where that

03:06.766 --> 03:07.347
is. And now I'm in the hotel, and the back end of the 
hotel is on Bryan Street. Oh, golly. I've lived on

03:15.822 --> 03:18.826
Bryan Street ever since I've been in Bryan. What 
did your father do? He was a cotton warehouse man.

03:26.276 --> 03:32.285
He worked in what was known as Bryan Brick 
Warehouse, and it was down here right where? Now,

03:32.305 --> 03:35.950
what building is there? part of it faced on Main 
Street. I forget what's there now. But he worked

03:40.968 --> 03:43.991
there. That's one reason we moved to town, because 
he had to come into town to work, you know. And then

03:51.139 --> 03:57.286
now there's another one. So he worked there. 
That's the main thing he did. He kind of got into

04:05.174 --> 04:08.238
some insurance business, but he didn't stay 
there. But his main business was the warehouse.

04:11.603 --> 04:16.289
And they had a wagon yard attached to the 
warehouse. And the men who brought the cotton in

04:16.309 --> 04:25.441
just camped there that night, you know, and then 
left the next morning going home. And we had a

04:27.204 --> 04:29.707
warehouse down there. Then the parker, Mr. Sam 
Parker had a warehouse down on North Main Street. A

04:36.902 --> 04:40.766
fellow, an Italian, came in one day. I was driving 
for a mule team and loaded with cotton, you know,

04:40.786 --> 04:48.814
the wagons loaded with cotton. And I met the 
attendant there and said, and what's your name?

04:52.538 --> 05:01.287
And for instance, he said, well, Tony Scaniato or 
some kind of Italian name. And came in the next few

05:01.773 --> 05:05.559
days, and he had another big wagon load. This time 
he had a six-mule team. And he says, and what's your

05:08.103 --> 05:09.264
name? And he told him again what his name was. Came 
in the next week, had a big wagon load of cotton, and

05:12.349 --> 05:16.876
he says, and what's your name? He said, seemed like 
it was yesterday.

05:22.664 --> 05:31.037
But Father did, he had, he was, we, my folks were the 
first people Among the first Presbyterian

05:31.625 --> 05:40.156
membership here, they came from a little place out 
here north of Ryan called Concord. And my father

05:41.378 --> 05:46.905
was superintendent of the Sunday school for 25 
years. And when he retired, they gave him a family

05:47.726 --> 05:51.711
Bible, a great big family Bible. And the 
Presbyterian church is down here where the city

05:52.212 --> 05:56.578
hall is now. And it faced west. It was like The 
church was just like a big white country church,

06:01.426 --> 06:14.969
you know, and had two front doors and an entrance 
hall, and of course had the steeple and the bell.

06:15.610 --> 06:22.422
But the Galveston storm blew the steeple off and 
the bell fell. But they still have the bell. It's

06:25.168 --> 06:26.511
stored in somewhere. But we've had two churches 
now, and they haven't put the bell up yet. There are

06:30.161 --> 06:32.768
a lot of Presbyterians around here in the area? Oh, 
yeah. We have a nice congregation. We have a

06:35.616 --> 06:38.824
beautiful church now. I worked in the church and 
did everything from sweeping the floors to

06:39.580 --> 06:47.390
teaching a Sunday school class.

06:48.472 --> 06:50.915
As I say, I don't know dates. Oh, that doesn't make 
any difference. You said about the Galveston

06:52.858 --> 06:56.643
storm blew down the bell? Oh, yeah. It blew the 
steeple. They never did put the steeple back on.

07:03.222 --> 07:04.864
And what was the question you made? I've heard 
about the storm. Was that the one that just flooded

07:06.986 --> 07:10.530
the whole island or something like that? Well, 
now, you know, Carla, yes, that was the one that

07:10.550 --> 07:15.175
was, yeah. We had a great big book about this long 
and about that wide. And it was, when I had to move up

07:20.681 --> 07:25.206
here, everything got lost, you know. But we had 
that garrison storm portrayed from one end to the

07:25.226 --> 07:29.230
other. The convents were boomed, were drowned 
out, you know, and everything.

07:38.010 --> 07:41.836
But Carla did a lot of damage, but that's more 
recent, you know. What about something more about

07:41.957 --> 07:45.542
your brothers and sisters? How many brothers and 
how many sisters did you have? There was eleven

07:47.666 --> 07:49.789
children in the family. We had five boys and six 
girls.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.163
I don't want this to go on tape.

08:08.533 --> 08:11.096
We lived family style. And we all worked together. 
We had a big garden spot. We had three cows. Now, we

08:17.083 --> 08:18.265
were living in town. There was not very many 
ordinances then. We had three cows. And we had a

08:24.762 --> 08:29.387
small peat pen off to one side. And we had a long 
grape arbor in the garden with grapes just hung

08:29.407 --> 08:36.476
like that. And we all had a wonderful, wonderful 
garden. We lived at home. Well,

08:41.041 --> 08:50.612
we would kill. We didn't have ice boxes to keep the 
meats in. We would salt it down. It was put down in

08:56.249 --> 09:04.461
brine, and some of the meats we took out was just 
real good breakfast bacon, you know. My father had

09:04.681 --> 09:10.670
a good preservative recipe, you know. It was salt, 
peat, and sugar, and I don't know what all,

09:11.691 --> 09:16.177
something. But we lived at home, and we just didn't 
have much money, but We had a nice home to live in.

09:25.321 --> 09:27.263
That's the main thing, yeah. Well, what about, you 
said you came from a school of hard knocks. Any way

09:31.027 --> 09:33.650
back before that? Well, I mean that, what I mean is 
that we didn't have any money for us to have a

09:33.930 --> 09:41.157
college education. Yeah, what about your 
elementary or education? Well, I went to our

09:45.722 --> 09:53.190
school, had ten grades, and I went through the 
ninth grade. But there was a private school here

09:54.115 --> 10:09.089
and my sister just younger than I, Mrs. Tina 
Johnson, who passed away a couple of weeks ago, she

09:54.115 --> 10:09.089
and I were living in walking distance of this 
private school. It was kind of a college. And I had a

10:14.253 --> 10:22.941
chance to get some botany, some trigonometry, and 
things like that that I didn't get in the public

10:14.253 --> 10:22.941
school. The superintendent of this little 
college gave mother a chance to send the two of us at

10:23.663 --> 10:33.695
a reduced price, you see. And we both graduated the 
same year. Tinny was salutatorian and I was

10:37.660 --> 10:41.024
valedictorian. We had three, what do you call it, 
three grades. There was first prize, well not

10:47.752 --> 10:51.797
first prize, What would it be? First notation? And 
then I was second. I was second in the graduating

10:57.624 --> 10:59.686
class. And in this school, we had debates. We had 
public debates. And I liked it because we had the

11:04.932 --> 11:10.157
botany and we had trigonometry. And then we had a 
very good music teacher there, too, you see. So it

11:15.502 --> 11:19.146
was really a nice place to go. And that, right now, 
There's the Newman Printing Company on the

11:23.131 --> 11:28.161
grounds. Oh, really? Uh-huh. It was a big 
two-story house, white house, and it was called

11:31.368 --> 11:37.541
the Masonic Hall. And when that was torn down, this 
other building was put up there. I was glad that I

11:44.326 --> 11:47.010
got this education. We only had reading, writing, 
and arithmetic in high school. You said you had a

11:50.354 --> 11:52.517
good music teacher? Did you play any instruments 
or anything? Well, we had an elderly lady from

11:56.163 --> 12:02.672
north, up north somewhere, but she was a good 
instructress. But we had some,

12:03.613 --> 12:08.680
what do you call the... When somebody has a 
graduation, they have a special program. Oh,

12:13.718 --> 12:13.999
yeah. Commencement? No, not a commencement. A 
recital. A recital, yeah. Thank you for a word. We

12:22.912 --> 12:25.917
had recitals that were very nice. We had a public 
place where we had most all of our programs. It was

12:33.248 --> 12:34.971
located down here where this... First National 
Bank drive-in bank is, and it was called the Bryan

12:35.322 --> 12:40.187
Opera House. It eventually burned, but we used to 
have our debates. You see now you have it at the

12:45.333 --> 12:51.479
schools and things, but we didn't have anything 
like that when I was coming on. What did you usually

12:51.639 --> 12:52.861
debate about? Just topics of the day? Well, the 
biggest thing that, now let's see, was with regard

12:54.442 --> 13:02.511
to the Russian, Japanese, and Russian issues. I 
mean... They had a big war or something? Yeah, oh

13:08.294 --> 13:08.994
yeah. That's when the Russian and Japanese were 
fighting so badly. What was the real question? It

13:16.381 --> 13:16.701
was...

13:22.567 --> 13:24.509
There's a word in there that I can't get. Should 
America join in or something like that? No.

13:31.195 --> 13:33.477
Whether it was a good idea for them to be at, across 
ways, you know. But anyhow, my side lost.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.623
There was two boys and two girls.

13:50.626 --> 13:53.430
But oh, I tell you, I did more reading. I could have 
fought two or three battles if I'd have had a

13:54.551 --> 13:57.074
chance. And then that school finally folded up. 
The man died, the president died, and it folded up.

14:08.691 --> 14:09.552
Anybody home? No, we're gone. In your social life, 
you know, when you were growing up in school or

14:12.857 --> 14:18.265
anything, did you have dances or whatever? Well, I 
never did dance, I never did throw dice, and I never

14:18.786 --> 14:24.975
did drink.

14:26.237 --> 14:27.579
But still, you had a good time. But I had a real good 
time, and I knew what I had. Yeah. And I had always

14:33.481 --> 14:37.525
had a very pleasant situation. We had lots of 
things that we attended. I don't know whether

14:41.029 --> 14:43.812
people know anything about it today. Is that we had 
hay rides, and we had play parties, and we had a heel

14:44.713 --> 14:55.645
and toe dance a lot of times. And everybody seemed 
to be in a congenial attitude, you know. So we

15:02.557 --> 15:07.362
didn't have any, none of the things that they have 
today. And so far as graduating at the College of

15:08.803 --> 15:17.012
Hard Knocks, I had to get mine the best way I could. 
And I have gotten most of my education from

15:17.072 --> 15:22.458
observation. I've kept one eye open on all 
corners. And we had... where we'd have recitals,

15:33.674 --> 15:40.722
and we called them musicals more than anything. 
And all I did was to go and listen because I didn't,

15:41.904 --> 15:49.713
in fact I couldn't carry a tune in a sack, I don't 
think. But we had always, and we had lots of parties

16:01.096 --> 16:04.821
maybe a public place chaperoned by some fewer 
ladies.

16:07.585 --> 16:13.574
But we always had a very nice, mostly the weekends, 
you know. The rest of the time was devoted to the

16:14.876 --> 16:16.859
books. And I never did absorb much of them.

16:24.249 --> 16:29.837
But now, my work has been volunteer work. I worked 
at different places in town. I worked at the

16:32.970 --> 16:37.516
telephone office, I worked at the drug store, and I 
worked at... Were you a telephone operator? I was a

16:39.318 --> 16:41.661
telephone operator for several years. Really 
good many years. I

16:43.703 --> 16:53.395
worked in the time when we cranked the bells, 
cranked the switchboard. The manager of the

16:53.948 --> 17:00.237
telephone company said, Well, since you've done 
everything in the telephone company now, but

16:53.948 --> 17:00.237
climb a pole.

17:02.921 --> 17:21.407
But he would go out on the line, you know, and have a 
test

17:02.921 --> 17:21.407
phone with him and call in and pick up the trouble, 
and I would be able to locate it on the switch on

17:02.921 --> 17:21.407
the... The board back of the switchboard, you 
know. But I worked at all places in the telephone

17:27.044 --> 17:32.694
office, long distance and rural and local. One 
lady called me one day and said, I'm going to cross

17:33.996 --> 17:37.783
the street. I'm going to put the baby by the phone. 
and take the receiver down, and if he cries, will

17:40.523 --> 17:43.087
you call me? So I babysit it, too. Over the 
telephone? Over the telephone. Golly. So that's

17:51.120 --> 17:53.063
the way we lived in that day and time. You know, 
there's a lot of contact. I don't think anybody

17:55.527 --> 17:57.030
would do that now. But in my later years,

17:58.873 --> 18:07.206
I have over 35 years with the Red Cross. what used to 
be the Grey Ladies. We don't have the Grey Ladies

18:09.132 --> 18:11.915
anymore. And counting the, and we worked, one lady 
and I, Mrs. Lyons and I, went to Marlin and made

18:11.935 --> 18:27.613
arrangements to work at the Marlin Veterans 
Hospital. And I have had, I was one of the, well I was

18:28.874 --> 18:35.522
the first one that got the 1,000 hour The pen for 
1,000 hours of volunteer work. We have several who

18:39.114 --> 18:43.360
have gotten those hours, too. We've had a good 
group that has worked at Marlin every week. Four or

18:48.346 --> 18:53.333
five go up and do what they call pilot service. And 
they were the Red Cross gray ladies then, but now

18:53.353 --> 19:01.985
they are the Brazos volunteer. Brazos area 
volunteer group. This week. And she's one of them.

19:06.518 --> 19:08.560
She went up to Marlin this week. And we work for the 
day up there. We leave about 7 o'clock in the

19:11.864 --> 19:14.487
morning and get back about 4. We got back about 10 
minutes to 4. Did you? We generally made it in a long

19:19.393 --> 19:21.575
time ago. We made it in about 5, but then between 4 
and 5, you know. And so, and I have, since I've not

19:26.040 --> 19:34.450
been able to participate physically, I've done 
volunteer work. here. For instance, these things

19:36.089 --> 19:38.673
I'm making. I work with the church.

19:43.419 --> 19:50.468
My group at the church works with the indigent 
people, you know, to a certain extent. And we make

19:50.488 --> 19:53.091
something out of nothing. We take a man's shirt and 
we cut the collar off and use the front part for a

19:53.572 --> 20:02.964
baby gown. We put laced down the front part and at 
the collar. We take a part of the tail of the shirt

20:07.052 --> 20:11.557
and make the sleeves and put lace on that. And we 
have that for the gown, or for the little gown you

20:12.298 --> 20:15.922
might say. And we take the tail of the shirt and make 
a diaper shirt out of it. And we'll take the, if it's

20:22.009 --> 20:29.417
a long sleeve shirt, there's a bi-side and a 
straight side to the sleeve. We'll sew that

20:30.218 --> 20:31.960
together. and then we peek over the outside edge of 
it and make a diaper. Then when we get ready to

20:40.201 --> 20:45.749
dispose of them, we make what they call a lead. We 
put in two or three of these gowns and the little

20:46.930 --> 20:59.348
butterfly baby jackets and two or three dresses 
and three or four dozen diapers.

21:00.610 --> 21:06.939
Then we put that all in a package and take it to the 
courthouse to this office where they dispose of

21:00.610 --> 21:06.939
them. The people who get them, I think, are 
screened. And they give them to some of them that

21:11.005 --> 21:16.493
don't have things to start off with. So that's one 
thing I do. This goes into that, too, you see. And I

21:22.302 --> 21:29.092
have made, this is called a wheelchair lap robe. 
Mm-hmm. I made 50 of those for the Marlin Hospital

21:30.462 --> 21:36.070
in the time that I've been with them. And then I've 
made 25 for friends. Some of them have a father in a

21:42.118 --> 21:44.040
nursing home. And then I made my niece one and two or 
three people in California. I've made some for a

21:49.427 --> 21:54.014
lady who lives. She used to visit us. Her son was in 
the Navy and she used to visit us. I made two for her.

22:00.199 --> 22:01.501
And things like that, you know. But I put my hours in 
the volunteer group because I still have my name on

22:02.101 --> 22:11.054
the calendar, I mean on the list. I make myself 
belong. I don't know whether I need to believe

22:13.497 --> 22:17.082
that, but I just didn't want to give it up. So I stay 
with them. I do do that. And in that work, I have I've

22:24.918 --> 22:37.713
rejuvenated bedspreads, a lot of knitting work, 
and our church knitted bandages for the

22:24.918 --> 22:37.713
leprosarium over in Africa. And I've knitted 75 
bandages. When we first started working with

22:42.198 --> 22:46.863
them, Larry, we made them 50 inches long. They're 
35 stitches on, 30 stitches on the needle. And we

22:51.208 --> 22:53.170
made them 50 inches long. And then they went up to 
72, then they went to 92, and now we have to do them 96

22:53.386 --> 22:59.775
inches long. And you know that's a long way. But 
we've had pictures from over there where they use

23:03.040 --> 23:14.297
these bandages, and they can't use the AC bandages 
because the rubbers deteriorate so badly, you

23:03.040 --> 23:14.297
know. So they use these bandages, and they can use 
them over and over. They take them off and wash

23:20.471 --> 23:25.719
them, disinfect them, and use them again, you 
know. But they couldn't do the AC bandage. I've

23:28.624 --> 23:34.894
seen several dead AC bandages over there, but I 
never have heard whether they used them or not.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.737
They might use them for something else. But this 
leprosarium, our church has been working, and I

23:37.658 --> 23:42.546
think other churches in town, Worked with the 
lepersoreum over there, too. But we do do that. You

23:49.276 --> 23:54.802
know, you were talking about all your jobs and 
everything. What about the transportation, you

23:54.822 --> 23:58.426
know, to and from? Did you have an old car or a wagon 
or a bugger or something? Well, when we had our

24:02.631 --> 24:05.394
original, we walked. Yeah, that's the thing. 
What'd you say, Willa Beth? We walked. Yeah, we

24:10.441 --> 24:12.084
walked. Then maybe somebody, but I never did get a 
ride to work, you know, the work that I did. But now

24:17.032 --> 24:30.815
they have, in the group going to Marlin, one lady 
takes her car and they, isn't it the group that goes

24:17.032 --> 24:30.815
together and pays for the gas? We pay for our gas. We 
pay for the gas. Now when we were gray ladies... The

24:36.003 --> 24:39.989
Red Cross furnished the gas for us. They don't do it 
anymore though now. We had a divorce. We'll have to

24:45.417 --> 24:52.888
have a barbecue or something. Each member pays a 
dollar a month, but if we don't have too many

24:53.008 --> 24:57.715
members... We don't have near the... It gets 
pretty high. We don't have near the members that we

24:59.678 --> 25:03.484
used to have. What about... about your marriage 
with Mr. Moore. Can you tell me more about what was

25:07.923 --> 25:11.047
he like? Mr. Moore was, when I met him, he was, they 
called them drummers in that day and time. He was a

25:21.122 --> 25:26.310
salesman for an implement company out of Dallas. 
And I worked with Parker Ashton Hardware Company.

25:32.118 --> 25:34.782
And we had It looked like, well, it was several 
years before we were married. But we were married

25:43.413 --> 25:45.756
at home. And

25:45.776 --> 25:53.325
we went to Mejia for a few days and came back. And he 
was, at the time that I married him, he was agent for

25:53.485 --> 26:04.279
the Seth Moring Plantation in the Brazos Abaddon, 
in the Mudville area.

26:05.272 --> 26:14.765
They had the house fixed up before we were married, 
and we moved down there and lived in, oh, we stayed

26:05.272 --> 26:14.765
down there quite a few years. I forget, maybe six, 
eight years. And then he took over the Magnolia

26:18.430 --> 26:24.638
Agency in Bryan, and we moved back to Bryan. And 
that's when we moved over here across from the

26:25.820 --> 26:29.405
depot. And he, we were married in 1915, and he died 
in, I've been a widow three times as long as I was

26:35.714 --> 26:41.020
married. I've had a hard fight with a short stick.

26:47.108 --> 26:57.480
But I had one son who, if I do say it myself, he really 
made his name in the military, in the Air Force. If

26:58.762 --> 26:59.983
you could see some of the honors that were some of 
the awards and things that he received. When did he

27:06.630 --> 27:08.011
go into the Air Force? Beg your pardon? When did he 
go into the Air Force? In, um, wait a minute. What

27:15.161 --> 27:15.722
had I done? 41, I believe. 41? He tried to, look over 
there and get that black book.

27:29.220 --> 27:29.721
This book here? Yeah. That was a command, not an 
entreaty.

27:37.686 --> 27:40.851
He tried to get in up here. This has all been stored 
away. I had to go to the hospital and they had to give

27:43.955 --> 27:46.980
up my room here. All this has been stored away. So 
it's in pretty bad shape.

27:56.133 --> 27:59.839
This is where he was in school and he was king of

28:04.696 --> 28:19.653
And

28:04.696 --> 28:19.653
this is very... Now when he tried to get in here in 
Bryan, they found he was colorblind. And he

28:21.856 --> 28:22.897
couldn't get in. He went back to college and tried. 
They had the recruiting office that was under the

28:26.802 --> 28:31.047
grandstand down there. He didn't get in. But when 
they heard this They were in Houston. He went to

28:36.318 --> 28:40.764
Houston, but he got behind a boy who was just going 
in. And he saw, he remembered what it was, you know.

28:46.112 --> 28:54.685
But he never did, he would never, he never got into 
officer's training, anything like that, because

28:46.112 --> 28:54.685
he wouldn't go in. He said if they would throw a 
green light or a red light, he wouldn't know which

28:54.705 --> 28:59.632
is which. But he made master sergeant. And he was a 
turret gunner. And he got an award in Italy and in

29:12.459 --> 29:17.164
England. And when he was in the islands, he gave 
blood for one of the main Rotarians down there. And

29:24.913 --> 29:29.397
he was given quite a bit of publicity then. And 
there's been so many awards. that you just can't

29:35.011 --> 29:40.777
realize that he's done as many as he did. And he was 
living in Tucson, Arizona when he was killed. He

29:46.363 --> 29:50.607
was in Davis Month in the Air Force Base out there. 
And... Sound like a real fine person? Well, you

29:54.991 --> 29:57.113
know, everybody thinks our crew is the blackest. 
Yeah. I know what you mean. Yeah. But he was... He

30:04.964 --> 30:09.928
really was a wonderful...
