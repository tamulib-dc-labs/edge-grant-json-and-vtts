WEBVTT

00:05.195 --> 00:07.277
Yeah, he'd better see about his time. No, I'm fine. 
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.164
And what about this collection? Well, it was kept 
in a museum. The little building was on the corner

00:18.291 --> 00:25.880
across from the system administration building. 
The old swine cholera virus lab. There's a little

00:30.605 --> 00:32.147
tiny building in there. And it was made into a 
museum. But then they found out that the state of

00:36.867 --> 00:43.035
Texas wouldn't fund any money to keep up a museum. 
You were not supposed to have a museum in a

00:43.416 --> 00:48.202
university in the state of Texas. Well, they just 
aren't going to put out money for a thing like that.

00:55.252 --> 01:01.560
So I think that most of that collection was put down 
underneath that building in a basement or

00:55.252 --> 01:01.560
something. And many years later, when they began 
to tear the old belly down, they found an old mummy,

01:01.928 --> 01:25.033
and I don't know if Dr. Francis had more stuff, some 
little foot bones from Eohippus, the first horse,

01:01.928 --> 01:25.033
and I don't know what all he had down, and old 
mastodon teeth and head and bones that he had dug

01:01.928 --> 01:25.033
up, old femurs and tibias and so on that from 
mastodons that he had dug up. All the stuff he found

01:27.687 --> 01:29.149
on the Brazos? On the Brazos River, yeah. And the 
clay pits and gravel pits and so on. So somebody

01:35.100 --> 01:40.530
wondered, well, where did all this stuff come 
from? I read it in the battalion. Big question.

01:46.801 --> 01:48.123
They found this stuff down there. They didn't know 
anything about where it was from. Well, it was the

01:51.490 --> 01:56.597
tail end of what was left of Ball and Francis' 
collection. And I don't know what's happened to

01:57.639 --> 02:04.068
them since then, but those things should have been 
preserved, especially Dr. Ball's. Because Dr.

02:05.750 --> 02:16.605
Ball spent many, many hours, painstaking work, on 
getting that material ready for presentation. It

02:16.625 --> 02:17.987
was a wonderful exhibit. He was an old Leipzig 
graduate, Ph.D. from Leipzig. No kidding. He

02:24.699 --> 02:29.345
graduated from Virginia first and then Ph.D. from 
Leipzig.

02:33.010 --> 02:33.812
Quite a scholar. Why do you think that Dr. Francis 
was given the Dean of the College, or the School of

02:35.314 --> 02:47.350
Veterinary Medicine? I think it was because he was 
the first one in there. He developed the treatment

02:52.400 --> 02:59.969
for the cattle fever tick and so on, tick fever 
treatment. At least we give him credit for that. So

03:04.715 --> 03:08.680
he had it.

03:12.592 --> 03:15.115
So I think that's the reason he was made dean. I 
think he made a very good dean. He was good. And at

03:18.539 --> 03:21.903
that time, he was all right. He was head of the 
Department of Anatomy and dean of the College of,

03:23.365 --> 03:28.971
or School of Veterinary Medicine it was then. How 
did he get along with the other administrators in

03:29.292 --> 03:32.575
other schools? Very well, very well. I think they 
all loved Dr. Francis. He was an old Ohio State

03:38.222 --> 03:41.586
University man. So Mr. Williams over in Animal 
Husbandry was from Ohio State. So many of them were

03:49.642 --> 03:52.304
from Ohio State. In fact, veterinary medicine was 
under Ohio State for many years. From Dr. Francis,

04:00.052 --> 04:11.522
through Dr. Marsteller, through Dr. Dunn, 
through Dr. Armistead, through Dr. Boughton,

04:00.052 --> 04:11.522
clear on down. All from Ohio State. Why? They 
passed it on, I guess. I don't know. Of course, it

04:20.889 --> 04:23.151
was all up to the board of directors.

04:29.297 --> 04:33.460
But Ohio State played a big part in the development 
of A&M. Well, Ohio State, in one of their

04:33.961 --> 04:41.728
anniversary

04:42.772 --> 04:45.817
statements, they made statements. Doc, if they 
hadn't produced but one man, and that man was Dr.

04:45.837 --> 04:58.336
Francis, Ohio State would have been more than 
repaid for the money they had put out on it. Yeah, I

04:58.356 --> 04:59.578
read that. Something like that. Yeah, that was. 
Anyway. Can you tell me something about the

05:05.387 --> 05:10.956
curriculum in the vet school back in the 1930s? 
Well, the curriculum has been expanded quite a

05:12.083 --> 05:16.788
bit. Yes, absolutely. Since those days. Here's an 
old 1929-30 catalog. Bullitt, Texas A&M. You can

05:25.398 --> 05:26.439
look over here. Yeah, we have those at the 
archives. Yeah. I don't know whether you have many

05:28.862 --> 05:32.886
of these old timers or not. But you can see they had 
very little. Department of Physiology and

05:36.030 --> 05:41.736
Pharmacology and Department of Veterinary 
Pathology, Associate Professor Horton. Only one

05:44.827 --> 05:45.788
person. He was my... Only one person. That has 
changed, hasn't it? Yeah. Here's Department of

05:51.134 --> 05:53.277
Veterinary Medicine and Surgery. Marstella, 
Associate Professors Leonard and Dunn. And

05:58.103 --> 06:00.025
Anatomy, Professor Francis. Only one. And the 
courses. Well, some of these courses were for

06:06.353 --> 06:09.917
animal husbandry students. This anatomy and 
physiology of domestic animals and animal

06:10.623 --> 06:16.290
diseases, those were AH courses. The 111, 112, and 
211, and 213 were the courses, the four courses for

06:16.790 --> 06:27.062
veterinary students in anatomy. Of course, that 
has been enlarged quite a bit now, along with

06:27.603 --> 06:32.649
graduate. Now, for graduates, they had only one 
course, 511, 512, veterinary anatomy. And Dr.

06:39.682 --> 06:42.987
Francis told him. Dr. Francis didn't teach much in 
the way of histology nor embryology either. I

06:48.977 --> 06:59.014
think on rainy days the students went in and drew 
pictures of the liver and spleen and lungs and

06:48.977 --> 06:59.014
heart. That's

06:59.054 --> 07:04.643
it. Because he just had these little old high 
school microscopes that didn't have any slides.

07:12.700 --> 07:25.333
So if the supply situation was that poor, what do 
you think of the quality of education back in the

07:12.700 --> 07:25.333
1930s, especially in comparison to today, or 
1970? It doesn't compare. There's no comparison.

07:30.438 --> 07:34.782
The people who graduated back in those days To me, 
it would be like quacks if they didn't keep up. I can

07:42.325 --> 07:53.963
say that in their clinics, they had very good 
instruction from Leonard and from Marstella and

07:42.325 --> 07:53.963
Dunn in the clinical years. But other than 
physiology

07:53.983 --> 08:04.178
and bacteriology

07:53.983 --> 08:04.178
and anatomy, gross anatomy, their education was 
minus it was lacking terribly lacking but i can say

08:06.470 --> 08:34.401
this for our education today our pre-clinical 
years i would put them up with anybody's medical

08:06.470 --> 08:34.401
school in fact i think a lot more of our courses in 
the first two years in veterinary medicine than i

08:06.470 --> 08:34.401
do in human medicine oh really And I mean that to be 
true because I have taken most of the courses in the

08:34.482 --> 08:39.909
first two years in medicine. And I have a good 
comparison there. And I like our first two years

08:45.477 --> 08:49.122
much better than I do. They would be better 
grounded in human medicine if they had our first

08:49.162 --> 08:55.170
two years. Their clinical years, they may have 
something on us. I think they do. But... Not the

09:04.148 --> 09:09.895
first two years.

09:09.915 --> 09:12.098
But back in those days, of course. It was the same 
way in human medicine in 1927 in Galveston, the

09:14.441 --> 09:26.796
year I was there as a freshman,

09:14.441 --> 09:26.796
as it was when I started out in veterinary 
medicine. Very poor in veterinary medicine, much

09:28.117 --> 09:32.923
better in human medicine. But as the years went, 
our first two years are better than theirs, and I'd

09:34.085 --> 09:42.441
put that down for anybody. I think they'd do much 
better if, this is off the record, if they could

09:44.585 --> 09:56.869
just put their medical students over with us for 
the first two years and then take them in their

09:44.585 --> 09:56.869
clinical years over there. I talked to, this is off 
the record, the other day I talked to Dick Davis,

09:58.807 --> 10:13.091
and he's been in physiology and pharmacology for 
many years, and I put him up above anybody they've

09:58.807 --> 10:13.091
got over there in human medicine. And the 
pathology that even I know, and I have kept up with

10:14.974 --> 10:21.405
my pathology through the years,

10:25.165 --> 10:37.419
I'd be willing to just sit down with anybody they 
have over there, from the head of their department

10:25.165 --> 10:37.419
on down, and let's just have a little test here and 
see what we do with these things. Even though I've

10:39.922 --> 10:42.766
been in anatomy since 1940. I did pathologic work 
for our graduate students in veterinary medicine

10:43.346 --> 10:52.337
for many years because they didn't have a 
diagnostic laboratory. If they had some tissue

10:52.655 --> 11:01.124
and they wanted to know what it was, what kind of a 
tumor am I dealing with, they sent it to me in

10:52.655 --> 11:01.124
anatomy. And for many years I did that. That was on 
the side. I don't know how many thousand of

11:04.808 --> 11:08.512
specimens I've sent back to them. The stain 
sliding all the way right up and so on. That's the

11:13.598 --> 11:21.126
reason when, this is off the record, when I 
retired, 5,000 bucks for this nice Caribbean trip

11:21.393 --> 11:26.839
and $1,000 sponge and money for her. Because I had 
given them worlds of service through the years.

11:33.506 --> 11:40.193
But to me, it was a source of, in pathology, it was a 
source of material coming in. Because I would run

11:40.973 --> 11:45.138
into things that they didn't know what it was. See, 
on Grow Sick, they couldn't make a diagnosis. So

11:49.844 --> 11:50.885
they sent it to me. Well, I was getting all of this 
material to make class sets from, as well as what I

11:50.926 --> 12:00.219
was picking up off post-mortem. So it worked out to 
my advantage, too, as well as to theirs. What did

12:05.927 --> 12:09.953
you think of your student colleagues back in the 
1930s? What was their quality? They were good

12:13.658 --> 12:14.780
students. That's what I've heard from them. They 
were all good students. They were older people.

12:19.949 --> 12:23.073
There wasn't but one single person in the group. 
There were 16 in my class. They were all married but

12:28.099 --> 12:29.640
one. And wives were helping them. They were all 
earnest, hardworking guys. Every one of them. And

12:42.215 --> 12:43.397
they've all done well.

12:48.102 --> 12:49.804
Some of them are dead and gone. Well, why'd you stay 
on? Why'd you stay on? So many of those other people

12:56.601 --> 13:02.589
went out and started private practices. Yes, 
sure. But some of them didn't. Some of them went on

13:06.154 --> 13:11.061
in teaching, like George Yeats in my class. He's 
been at the University of Florida for many years.

13:14.687 --> 13:18.492
In fact, he was taken down there to be dean of their 
College of Veterinary Medicine. state

13:18.826 --> 13:27.715
legislature fiddling around so long that he was 
too old when they finally got the money passed so

13:18.826 --> 13:27.715
they have someone else as dean. George is in his 60s 
now. He's too old to be dean. Well, I would put it to

13:35.163 --> 13:37.466
you this way. You had started out in medicine, and 
you had tuberculosis. And you were told at the

13:44.052 --> 13:48.377
state sanatorium out at Carlsbad do not go back 
into what you were doing when you broke down. So

13:54.701 --> 14:08.294
when I finished in veterinary medicine, I had no 
idea at all of going out into a hard practice,

13:54.701 --> 14:08.294
because that practice of veterinary medicine is 
hard. I mean, any hour of the day or night, any kind

14:08.594 --> 14:16.862
of weather, and you were out there in the pasture a 
lot or somewhere, in the sleet or rain or mud or what

14:17.213 --> 14:21.937
have you. And so teaching was what I wanted to do.

14:29.643 --> 14:36.729
And I think that I prepared myself for it by going on 
in pathology at Michigan. But you couldn't do much

14:36.769 --> 14:43.495
in those days on $1,800 or $1,500. No.

14:48.196 --> 15:01.368
When Dr. Mundink left in anatomy in 1940, Dr. 
Marsteller didn't know who he was going to put in as

14:48.196 --> 15:01.368
head of the department, because I was in 
pathology. Well, Dr. Mundink recommended me. Dr.

15:06.532 --> 15:12.297
Mundink left here and went with Latterly 
Laboratories as their chief veterinarian. He had

15:12.317 --> 15:17.562
a good place with them.

15:19.330 --> 15:23.274
Dr. Marsteller offered me headship of anatomy. 
Paid me $3,600 a year, 12 months, $300 a month.

15:31.544 --> 15:33.506
Well, we had bought this lot. We built our house and 
bought a car. Ruth was teaching school at Curtin.

15:39.072 --> 15:39.573
Oh, really? Yeah. What year was this now? This was 
in 1936. She had been teaching in Crockett, and she

15:43.577 --> 15:47.582
had had taught in the little school, Austonio, 
this side of Crockett on 21, a little consolidated

15:47.866 --> 15:54.112
school. And then we married in 34, and she taught 
over there two years, and then had an opportunity

15:55.253 --> 16:11.950
to pick up what she had to, let's

15:55.253 --> 16:11.950
see here. You were brought here to Curtin to do what 
to them in English? Affiliated. They wanted

16:17.968 --> 16:19.690
someone who could affiliate. And they had to have 
someone with a degree to affiliate their high

16:19.710 --> 16:26.156
school subjects. And so they brought her over 
here. We lived in Bryan for two years in apartments

16:27.757 --> 16:30.940
there. And they built a teacherage curtain. And 
then we moved out there and lived in the teacherage

16:33.223 --> 16:40.209
until we built this house and moved in here. And 
Ruth quit teaching. I told her she could either

16:42.071 --> 16:44.333
teach And we'd live in apartments, or else if we had 
a home, she'd have to quit teaching and take care of

16:45.275 --> 16:52.263
the home. One or the other. It was up to her. So she 
said, I want a home. So here we are, right here. So

17:00.493 --> 17:05.859
no, I never intended to practice when I went in on 
finishing veterinary medicine. The competition

17:08.202 --> 17:13.669
for that job that you received must have been 
rather tough, wasn't it? It was tough. But I think I

17:15.987 --> 17:18.751
had the best qualifications. I had three degrees 
at that time, bachelor's, master's, and a degree

17:20.093 --> 17:25.701
in veterinary medicine. And in those days, if you 
look at this old 1930 catalog, you'll find that a BS

17:25.721 --> 17:33.012
and MS was about all most people had. Very few of 
them had a degree in philosophy. Darnell was a...

17:43.898 --> 17:48.004
BS from Mississippi A&M 1913, master's from 
Missouri in 1916. And that's about as far as any of

17:48.865 --> 17:51.068
them went. Well, Thomas Otto Walton didn't have 
anything but a bachelor's degree and an LLD.

18:01.822 --> 18:04.206
I guess he was one of the best presidents we ever 
had.

18:07.009 --> 18:09.693
Now, I'm not quite clear on why you went to 
Michigan. Can you explain that to me again? I went

18:11.295 --> 18:13.298
to Michigan to study pathology. Because under Dr. 
Wharton there, I didn't have it. Well, I decided

18:20.980 --> 18:28.249
to, that since I was in pathology, I would go on and 
get a PhD in pathology. So I went up there to do that.

18:32.454 --> 18:34.677
And I got all the coursework. And then I had this 
opportunity to become head of anatomy as a full

18:36.199 --> 18:42.627
professor. A full professor? The head department 
in those days, you automatically became a full

18:45.973 --> 18:50.638
professor. So I went instructor, assistant 
professor to full professor. You couldn't pass

18:56.345 --> 18:58.968
that up. No way I could pass that one up. No way. I 
think there's $300 raised, too. Really? Worse

19:07.158 --> 19:07.778
than that. We were making $1,800. It was twice as 
much. 100% increase in salary? Felt the house and

19:15.314 --> 19:17.257
bought a car. Absolutely. And well, it was the same 
way in anatomy through the years. I didn't have

19:23.106 --> 19:30.558
time to do anything but teach and be my technician. 
I didn't have time for research. I didn't have much

19:33.483 --> 19:35.806
time for writing. And that's the reason that you 
look into what I have written in the way of

19:40.370 --> 19:43.575
technical stuff, and it's very little. Because on 
up through 1955, I was it. I had to do all my work. I

19:52.147 --> 19:53.790
don't know why it was. It was changed when the dean 
of Cornell Veterinary College What was his name?

20:03.057 --> 20:10.404
Anyhow, he came here, one of the AVMA Committees on 
Investigation of Veterinary Colleges. They

20:11.205 --> 20:13.607
appraise them every so often. And he went to talk. I 
told him. I had him out here one evening for dinner.

20:19.913 --> 20:26.320
And I told him I had been my own technician too many 
years. And I couldn't see paying. head of

20:30.708 --> 20:33.252
department salary for a technician. And he jumped 
Dr. Marsteller about it. And Dr. Marsteller gave

20:38.720 --> 20:43.707
me a part-time technician. A part-time 
technician. This was only half time. And up to that

20:49.897 --> 20:53.442
time, I had no secretary in the department either. 
Okay, not one? No. You buzz me, Miss Blue. No.

21:03.214 --> 21:04.876
So I got a half-time. Well, I don't know whether it 
was half-time. Anyway, Dr. Burns in physiology

21:07.239 --> 21:12.987
let me use his secretary for an hour or two a day. If I 
had anything to type or keep books, you had to keep

21:15.149 --> 21:22.399
your orders and everything. So

21:22.615 --> 21:33.767
in 1955, I would say that I began to get some 
technical help and secretarial help. Up to that

21:34.467 --> 21:37.030
time, no. I was it. Well, let's go back to the 
Depression, because I'm really interested in the

21:39.012 --> 21:42.996
Depression here in Texas. It wasn't nearly as 
severe as it was in many other parts of the country.

21:47.793 --> 21:57.484
But, and you already have described some of the 
conditions, but were there any shortages on

21:47.793 --> 21:57.484
campus ever that you remember, like food or 
anything like that? No problem with any food lines

21:58.485 --> 22:01.108
in Bryan? No, no. They had, over in the animal 
husbandry department, I remember they were

22:02.930 --> 22:12.862
killing cattle and canning the meat. Really? for 
the bread lines or whatever they had before people

22:13.932 --> 22:20.240
in Bryan, around in this community. In the county. 
You could go there, I guess, and get canned meat.

22:27.810 --> 22:33.837
And I know Ruth was out at Curtin in those days, and 
they had a food program. She'd get a barrel of

22:34.038 --> 22:39.805
butter, old rancid butter, and those people, I 
mean, a big barrel, yeah, a 50-gallon barrel of

22:40.426 --> 22:46.936
butter or whatever. Was there creamery here? I 
don't know. Where was that stuff from? Where'd you

22:49.761 --> 22:50.862
get that from? It's government. Oh, government. 
Government. It was all federal. But she said that

22:55.490 --> 23:00.598
the people who actually didn't need it were the 
ones who came and got it. Old rancid butter. That

23:06.326 --> 23:07.969
reminds me of that story of this. black man in 
Crockett long years ago. And he, of course,

23:11.554 --> 23:14.157
couldn't read and write. He went in the grocery 
store there to get some cheese. And the grocery man

23:18.082 --> 23:20.905
played a trick on him. He just gave him a little can 
of axle grease. And this fella dipped it. This is

23:28.054 --> 23:30.457
off the record. He got his crackers, you know, and 
started eating that stuff. And after a while, the

23:35.202 --> 23:38.226
grocer says, Sam? How is that? Or I said, that's 
pretty good cheese, but it sure am rancid. Right,

23:46.003 --> 23:47.624
he said, sure am ransom. Sure am ransom. He's 
eating that axle grease.

23:58.657 --> 23:59.678
My goodness. But I don't know how many cattle they 
killed over there, Every day, I know Dr. Wharton

24:04.970 --> 24:09.454
went over and inspected the pathologist. He went 
over and did all their meat inspection work for

24:09.975 --> 24:12.738
them. He was busy over there most of the time 
inspecting meat. And all that went into a can, old

24:19.965 --> 24:25.010
canners, about all they had. We called them hat 
racks, old poor cows.

24:33.792 --> 24:36.575
I don't think they ever got anything that was fit to 
eat. And who would they give this canned meat to?

24:40.961 --> 24:41.942
Mostly blacks. In the area, in this county then? I 
don't know whether they shipped any of it or not. I

24:50.973 --> 24:51.454
don't know. I know they had that program going over 
there. I know the meat was supposed to be given out

24:54.397 --> 24:59.884
to in the community. But insofar as I know, there 
was no shortage of food. I know I didn't have any

25:04.945 --> 25:08.070
shortage of food. We ate lots of beans and sweet 
potatoes. I know I was doing my cooking up there in

25:13.799 --> 25:18.346
the biology. I was a graduate assistant up there. 
And there was another old boy taking graduate work

25:21.030 --> 25:27.260
by the name of Towns, Homer Towns. So he and I did all 
our cooking. in bacteriology. I was in

25:31.189 --> 25:33.012
bacteriology then. So every time we'd fire up the 
gas stove for sterilization of glassware, we

25:33.873 --> 25:46.531
could stick a couple of sweet potatoes in the back 
of it. Or if we had something to autoclave, a piece

25:46.551 --> 25:57.928
of meat or what have you, some beans, just put them 
back in the back of the autoclave and rev her up, you

25:46.551 --> 25:57.928
know, and sterilize whatever you had. You're also 
cooking your Do dinner. Or whatever. Yeah, we did

26:04.401 --> 26:09.910
all our cooking over there in bacteriology in the 
preparation lab. But I don't think the college

26:09.930 --> 26:12.054
knew anything about it. They still don't. And they 
still don't. In fact, one semester, I lived up

26:15.861 --> 26:19.868
there. Really? Now this is off the record. I'm 
going to have to erase this old tape now. I had a pot

26:27.611 --> 26:32.056
that I put up on top of the shelving in the stock 
room. And what building was this now? In the old

26:34.079 --> 26:36.322
biology building. It's been torn down. About what 
year was this? This was long about 1934, about 34.

26:45.072 --> 26:55.225
That was the only way that I could make it, to do my 
own cooking and not have to pay for board and room

26:45.072 --> 26:55.225
somewhere. Otherwise, I couldn't have gone. But 
they never did. So you lived up in this. What about

27:04.209 --> 27:05.331
the janitor? I mean, didn't they ever lock the 
doors of this building? Well, yeah. Were you ever

27:09.076 --> 27:12.322
locked out and had to sleep in trees or anything? I 
had a key to the door. But janitorial help, they

27:16.027 --> 27:20.354
were all gone by 9 o'clock. And I was always up there 
working. I was running all this experimental work

27:23.555 --> 27:27.799
for my master's degree. So I figured if anybody 
ever caught me up there, by golly, I had to stay up

27:28.780 --> 27:35.447
there and check my growth. I was supposed to be 
living in Bryan. In fact, they looked over the

27:41.173 --> 27:48.160
place that this day's student was supposed to be 
living in in Bryan. And they passed on it. It was a

27:49.241 --> 27:51.503
very nice place, which I never stayed in. I took 
them in here to show them where I was staying. And

27:56.823 --> 27:59.145
the people there were very nice about it. They 
never asked us, you're living here. Oh, really?

28:06.151 --> 28:16.020
Well, that's nice.

28:16.040 --> 28:19.864
We had some very good students in those days. And 
they all seemed to have plenty of money. Really?

28:24.765 --> 28:26.046
Yeah. Back in the Depression? Yeah. How can you 
account for that? Well, here was Frankie Turia.

28:34.855 --> 28:38.959
Frankie Turia was from Brownsville. 
Y-T-U-R-I-A. Well, his people were wealthy.

28:44.345 --> 28:51.773
Frank had a Cadillac, and he had his horse, and his 
silver-trimmed saddle, and everything else.

28:51.793 --> 28:52.033
Sure. But there were people like old Joe White. Joe 
White's father was an MD, a veterinarian, and an

28:56.286 --> 29:02.052
MD, too, in Tennessee. And I think he was president 
of the state medical board and what have you. Old

29:05.896 --> 29:08.398
Joe had cars and what have you. Their parents were 
wealthy and could send them. We weren't. Of course

29:15.506 --> 29:16.386
we weren't. We weren't. Wondering where our next 
meal was coming from. I can remember the time when I

29:22.844 --> 29:32.982
caught a ride from College Station to Bryan at 
noon, and that was quite a trip in those days. It was

29:33.363 --> 29:34.525
country roads. I had a dime, and for that dime I 
could get a bigger hamburger in Bryan than I could

29:36.208 --> 29:44.322
at College Station. They put tomatoes and stuff on 
it in Bryan.

29:51.211 --> 29:52.472
It was worth a ride. It was worth a big thumb. Of 
course, you could ride on the train, Brian, for 20

29:57.498 --> 30:01.023
cents. But you wouldn't have had it. I didn't have 
20 cents. I had to dine for that hamburger that I was

30:04.787 --> 30:08.191
going to get. But that's all I had. I had an old pair 
of corduroy breeches that I wore most of the time.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.383
And I'd wash them out. about once every two weeks on 
Saturday afternoon if it was pretty. I could hang

30:22.712 --> 30:24.854
them in the sun and I'd stay inside. I didn't have 
anything else put on. No kidding? Oh. Really? Just

30:28.337 --> 30:30.359
an old pair of corduroy breeches. Just an old pair 
of corduroy breeches. And I wore that kind of. Now

30:33.722 --> 30:37.705
what happened when you became a professor all of a 
sudden? Oh. I was in the money then. Oh, so how did

30:41.529 --> 30:42.930
you dress then? I wore a suit. Mm-hmm. Yeah. He was 
the best dressed man. I wore a suit. The one thing

30:50.042 --> 30:55.770
Ruth would never let me do was leave home without a 
nice shine. I don't care if it's raining outside. I

30:57.352 --> 30:58.754
said, what's the use of shining them? It's 
raining. She said, well, at least you leave home

31:01.297 --> 31:08.467
looking nice.

31:08.487 --> 31:09.068
Bless her. And she has a breather in her left shoe 
now because she Dropped a four-pound can of orange

31:13.747 --> 31:19.653
juice on that foot off the shelf down at Piggly 
Wiggly the other day. You know what a breather is?

31:21.996 --> 31:23.397
That's a breather. Really? No kidding. Now that 
you've talked about it, I'll take it off. Yeah. She

31:29.243 --> 31:31.986
didn't have trouble with her foot for a week. Well, 
let's talk for a minute here about why you went on to

31:32.126 --> 31:40.275
get a PhD at Galveston. In Galveston? Yeah. Why did 
you do that? just for my own

31:43.042 --> 31:51.309
satisfaction I guess. That was all.
