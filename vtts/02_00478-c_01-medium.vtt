WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:06.802
He was on the shape staff, yeah. And he had orders 
for our, for the 302nd Transport Wing to provide

00:06.822 --> 00:31.624
him with airlift to move French political 
prisoners back to France as soon as they were

00:06.822 --> 00:31.624
released from the different prison camps in 
Germany.

00:32.549 --> 00:37.615
also asked that some member from our command go 
with him. Colonel Bateman condescended to let me

00:38.997 --> 00:42.340
go along with him. We went to many a camp, picked 
these guys up. The U.S.

00:53.734 --> 01:01.543
Army would overrun the camp and we'd be right in 
behind them. Some of them would be home back in

01:02.047 --> 01:05.611
France the very next day. And the

01:06.252 --> 01:27.976
French were appreciative of it to the degree that 
that's,

01:06.252 --> 01:27.976
I know it was the reason that I was awarded the 
French Quarter Gear with Silver Star for the

01:06.252 --> 01:27.976
action.

01:27.996 --> 01:29.758
I'm sure that Angel... Since he was the lieutenant 
colonel at the time, he probably was given the

01:31.578 --> 01:47.444
Prince Carthagare with palm, but the degree of the 
Carthagare is usually determined by the rank of

01:31.578 --> 01:47.444
the person receiving it. Tell me about the 
conditions in these German prison camps.

01:54.997 --> 01:55.257
Well,

02:03.387 --> 02:31.622
I'm going to kick that thing off

02:03.387 --> 02:31.622
in

02:03.387 --> 02:31.622
a

02:03.387 --> 02:31.622
minute. The best way to describe the condition is 
probably try to describe some of the people that we

02:32.294 --> 02:54.415
pulled out of those camps that had long since given 
up on life and had long since, definitely long

02:32.294 --> 02:54.415
since given up ever expecting to get back to 
France.

02:57.118 --> 03:01.542
I had, subsequent to that time, been through 
the...

03:04.643 --> 03:14.076
camps

03:04.643 --> 03:14.076
where they imprisoned all the Jews and disposed of 
most of them. I guess

03:15.258 --> 03:32.001
the next degree of

03:15.258 --> 03:32.001
just existing is probably the way the political 
prisoners lived because they had no reason to

03:33.652 --> 03:46.032
execute them but they were certainly hoping that 
they would die and therefore no longer have to

03:33.652 --> 03:46.032
maintain them and provide for them. The

03:46.052 --> 03:54.546
sanitary conditions were

03:46.052 --> 03:54.546
horrible.

04:17.223 --> 04:45.475
Some of the

04:17.223 --> 04:45.475
camps that we went into,

04:47.193 --> 05:01.540
later years have been used by US Army and US Air 
Forces in Germany. It seems that once the property

05:01.560 --> 05:06.028
is taken out of the German It's just handed down 
from one agent to another to use. And how do we use

05:13.192 --> 05:14.053
it? Denazification program? After what? How do we 
use these? Oh, as either a location for one of our

05:19.740 --> 05:32.075
units or administrative headquarters or 
something like

05:19.740 --> 05:32.075
that. So most of the French political prisoners 
then were just on the edge of starvation. Right.

05:40.467 --> 05:55.709
I'd say that 90%

05:40.467 --> 05:55.709
to 95% of them are requiring some type of 
assistance just to transport themselves, you

05:40.467 --> 05:55.709
know, from one place to another.

05:55.729 --> 05:59.515
Did you go in with doctors to ? The

05:59.755 --> 06:09.529
main thing was to move them out of the country. not 
to try to medicate them where we found them, but to

06:09.948 --> 06:16.220
move them to France. And then wherever they were 
offloaded in France, they were cared for. But the

06:20.208 --> 06:27.722
main thing was to move them, to get them out of 
Germany post-haze and emptied up. Because this

06:29.606 --> 06:32.952
operation was... or at times less than a half a mile 
behind the moving front. Not to try to establish

06:39.566 --> 06:51.843
something there, but as soon as they were overrun, 
get those poor suckers out of there and get them

06:39.566 --> 06:51.843
home.

06:51.863 --> 07:00.154
A good question might be, who laid this on and was it 
all part of the effort And I've never even really

07:00.640 --> 07:17.744
looked at that, because

07:00.640 --> 07:17.744
I'd look at it now and say it's just part of the 
Humanitarian Act, and it had very little to do with

07:00.640 --> 07:17.744
prosecuting the war.

07:21.950 --> 07:23.752
And your job was transportation, then? The range 
of transportation, the climate? We called back to

07:25.555 --> 07:27.998
our unit to bring So many birds in a certain 
location.

07:33.274 --> 07:49.991
And then angels, of course,

07:33.274 --> 07:49.991
to administer to them and find out who within the 
organization was their titular head.

07:52.694 --> 07:57.259
There seems to be a, though I've never been one, 
I've never been in the, I have talked to many people

07:57.526 --> 08:05.838
that have been in prison when the prison was 
overrun or changed hands or something like that.

08:05.858 --> 08:20.760
There seems to be some type of feeling between the 
guard and the person being guarded, you know,

08:05.858 --> 08:20.760
that, well, we're leaving and good luck to you and 
take off, you know, and not want to have animosity.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.322
I mean, that's all over with now. Hope you live, 
maybe, you know. Was there that feeling today? In a

08:27.177 --> 08:29.399
number of places there were, yes. I have a friend 
that lives right here that was a prisoner. And the

08:33.203 --> 08:46.138
Germans, when they got ready to leave because the 
Russians were coming, the Germans actually

08:33.203 --> 08:46.138
handed over to them arms and ammunition so that the 
US forces could keep the Russians down. This type

08:47.719 --> 08:49.001
of thing. Where was he a prisoner? In Eastern 
Germany? Yep.

09:01.803 --> 09:06.408
But it had to be in the northern part because that's 
where the Russians were coming down.

09:09.451 --> 09:18.300
He was on a bomb crew that

09:09.451 --> 09:18.300
went down. Do you think there was that type of 
relationship between the French guards and the

09:18.320 --> 09:26.188
German guards and the French prison? No. No? No. 
Not politically. No. They'd still hope to die. Why

09:34.281 --> 09:35.623
didn't they just shoot him? They seemed to shoot 
everybody else, didn't they? Well, under

09:37.286 --> 09:42.534
different types of control, I guess. I don't know. 
What were your feelings when you got into these

09:44.357 --> 09:51.228
bases

09:44.357 --> 09:51.228
and saw these conditions? I don't really know. I 
can't answer that.

09:56.636 --> 09:57.257
Do you... It doesn't take the one or two of them, and 
then you become kind of immune to it. The job is to

10:02.734 --> 10:10.664
move them and

10:02.734 --> 10:10.664
help them get out of there.

10:17.974 --> 10:22.180
There's not so much that we can do. Once we're in, 
identify that they are the... French political

10:27.764 --> 10:39.737
prisoner and not of their own people or something 
like that, call the taxi and get them aboard the

10:27.764 --> 10:39.737
taxi and move to the next one. Did you feed them 
first? No way would you feed them. There's

10:45.363 --> 10:45.984
something there. Within the camp? Yeah.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.193
We're just a handful of people. Again, 
recognizing them, call the taxi, and send them

10:54.865 --> 10:58.791
home.

11:06.602 --> 11:09.406
And how long did you have this job? Well, this was a 
project effort. It's September, isn't it? No, it

11:13.652 --> 11:19.320
was just a project that went on about four to six 
weeks, something like that. as fast as the army was

11:20.279 --> 11:43.418
moving we were just right behind for that period of 
time and this is in when probably march and april of

11:20.279 --> 11:43.418
1945 that era at that time the war ends in may so is 
that right right before the end of the war then

11:20.279 --> 11:43.418
yeah it could have been as early as even in february

11:52.983 --> 11:58.691
Why didn't they, do you know why they didn't have a 
French, why didn't they have French officers

11:52.983 --> 11:58.691
doing this? Why did they have American officers? 
Because they needed the transportation. Well,

12:03.998 --> 12:12.050
the reason they didn't have an American officer 
from our outfit is because, you know, we had the

12:03.998 --> 12:12.050
inter-theater transport. We were set up to do this 
type of work, whereas, all respect to the troop

12:14.193 --> 12:22.905
carrier, you know, they're good at loading 
parachutists and and pushing people out the door,

12:23.206 --> 12:27.430
you know, in Geronimo and hanging on their cables. 
But, you know, we were set up to carry passengers,

12:27.470 --> 12:36.397
to manifest people, to care for them, you know, and 
so on. Now, why Angel instead of a French officer? I

12:41.962 --> 12:47.427
don't know, other than the fact that we were behind 
the American Army back then. Oh, okay, so you're in

12:47.447 --> 12:52.131
the American sector.

12:52.151 --> 12:52.251
Yeah. Okay, then what happened? Then what was your 
next? This is a temporary assignment, so then did

12:58.002 --> 13:00.826
you go back to Paris? Yeah, I just went back. The 
fact is, while I was gone, there's a fellow that's

13:01.987 --> 13:16.886
up at College Station now, worked for me,

13:01.987 --> 13:16.886
Jack Jones. I don't know what department he's in up 
there, but... He set in for me while I was gone. He

13:26.105 --> 13:29.388
was the headquarters commandant. We had worked 
together before. In fact,

13:31.290 --> 13:42.983
as the war simmered down, we put this history of the 
302nd Transport Wing together and had it. Oh, did

13:43.003 --> 13:43.483
you? You wrote that? It's nothing but assembly of 
stuff.

13:50.804 --> 13:57.213
He was the photographer on the battalion, and he 
did all of the photographic work. Oh, it's

13:57.274 --> 14:08.650
horrible writing, but you've got to remember it 
was put together over there, and we had it

13:57.274 --> 14:08.650
reproduced and hardbacked and everything 
without costing anybody, and everybody got a copy

13:57.274 --> 14:08.650
of it. That's great. Then about that time, things 
really began to peter out, and

14:35.978 --> 14:37.660
By that time the war was about over.

14:42.624 --> 14:42.904
Yeah. And were you interested or did you think that 
you'd be going to

14:43.084 --> 14:54.475
the Pacific Front? No, I had no idea that I'd go 
there because of the time that I'd already spent in

14:54.495 --> 15:03.943
Europe and the

15:05.543 --> 15:18.255
It

15:05.543 --> 15:18.255
even looked like things were beginning to get 
pretty good for us in the Pacific, even before they

15:05.543 --> 15:18.255
dropped the two nuke bombs.

15:20.757 --> 15:32.688
The way that people were being relieved from 
Europe was based on how many points they had and how

15:20.757 --> 15:32.688
many service and all that business. Of all things, 
I had gone over with a 7th Air Depot Group, and I was

15:36.323 --> 15:44.494
reassigned to an air depot group in Belgium to come 
home. It was coming through the States, and all I

15:45.456 --> 15:52.005
was going to do is just ride with them and then drop 
off from the States. So I went over with an air depot

15:52.385 --> 16:00.677
group, and I came back with an air depot group, and I 
did all the work with transport and carrying.

16:02.547 --> 16:26.732
and not to let a guy have a free ride when i got up to 
the air depot group the commander called me in and

16:02.547 --> 16:26.732
called me in and he said well you're going to go home 
and you're on the list when we get to the states you

16:02.547 --> 16:26.732
drop off and we all take leave and we're going on the 
pacific And he said, it looks like you're going to

16:28.332 --> 16:32.196
have to do some work for us. And I said, like what? 
And he says, I don't know about that. He says, but

16:38.263 --> 16:44.029
I'm appointing you a train commander to move us 
from here to the port.

16:47.953 --> 16:49.795
And I said, thanks a lot, Colonel. And he said, 
well, you didn't want to sit around here.

16:55.241 --> 16:56.803
We were right out of Liège, Belgium. He said, you 
didn't want to sit around here all this time and do

16:57.796 --> 17:02.343
nothing, did you? I said, no, sir, I want to be the 
train commander. He said, all right, you're the

17:04.226 --> 17:08.612
train commander. And so I put together a 
three-element move and three train loads, moved

17:08.632 --> 17:25.578
them from where they were in Liège

17:08.632 --> 17:25.578
to Camp Top Hat, I guess it was. All of the... camps 
that people were assembled at were named after

17:26.888 --> 17:30.774
cigarettes. Can you imagine that? Top hat. I bet 
you didn't even know there was a top hat cigarette.

17:37.224 --> 17:44.836
I don't have any smoke cigarettes, but it was one of 
the cigarettes that came about during the war and

17:37.224 --> 17:44.836
it was a cheapie.

17:47.760 --> 17:54.010
Anyway, we moved the air depot group into the camp 
top hat. ultimately boarded ship

17:55.610 --> 18:03.199
and came home. And where did you land in America? 
Landed at Hampton Roads, Virginia. Was there a

18:10.888 --> 18:14.993
festival for the returning veterans or was there 
some kind of parade? No.

18:18.397 --> 18:24.925
We went into the polling camp there in

18:18.397 --> 18:24.925
Virginia. and we were there for about two days they 
got us all organized and put

18:27.098 --> 18:54.473
a whole slew of us on a train headed to san antonio 
here

18:27.098 --> 18:54.473
fortunately there was a major on there that 
outranked me so that made him the train commander

18:56.748 --> 19:05.579
At that time, they were already processing those 
of us that had enough points to get out, that wanted

18:56.748 --> 19:05.579
out. And they assigned a code to everybody in the 
Air Corps. I don't know about the Army. And once

19:13.248 --> 19:25.843
recommended for regular, recommended for 
reserve, Once regular, once reserved. The one was

19:29.880 --> 19:32.523
yes, and the two was no. And this little girl had 
already communicated with me and said, if this is

19:34.326 --> 19:42.456
what service is like, well, you better choose. So 
my code was 1121, recommended for regular,

19:43.318 --> 19:49.005
recommended for reserved. Didn't want regular, 
but did want reserved. So got on back. took leave

19:57.633 --> 20:12.475
after we got to San Antonio, and then I had to go back 
to Wright-Patterson and turn in all of the stuff

19:57.633 --> 20:12.475
that by then the Japs had given up. So this Air Depot 
group stuff was all at Wright-Patterson. We had to

20:16.240 --> 20:19.625
go back, break it out of crates, and turn it in. And 
then

20:19.665 --> 20:24.973
they sent me down to

20:27.974 --> 20:42.047
Ellington

20:27.974 --> 20:42.047
closed and sent me over to Randolph and started 
processing me out. And they said, you know, if you

20:42.067 --> 20:56.580
were to stay in the service two more months, you'd 
get an automatic promotion to lieutenant

20:42.067 --> 20:56.580
colonel. Well, this was

20:58.653 --> 21:07.722
in the fall of 45. And I had 120 days leave, which 
pushed my termination date up to April.

21:22.297 --> 21:26.601
But my plans were to be back in A&M Well, the first of 
February, you know, when the second term

21:27.053 --> 21:32.878
started. I said, Colonel, you're very kind. Can 
you guarantee me that I will not be on a

21:35.561 --> 21:45.930
court-martial board or a board of inquiry when 
it's time to release me? No, no way.

21:50.314 --> 21:52.156
I said, I can't take it then. I'll go ahead and get 
out. I gave up. I can't understand. I mean, could

21:57.905 --> 22:02.271
you explain why you decided not to stay on active 
duty? Yeah. She said, there's your wife?

22:07.759 --> 22:07.859
Yeah. Did you want to? Or were you ready to get out? I 
think I was ready. You were ready to get out? Why?

22:20.076 --> 22:21.999
Were you discouraged with it? Or why did you want 
to? I wasn't real sure of what was. There

22:25.930 --> 22:37.728
we built up the biggest, largest fighting force 
that the world had ever known. And I could see it

22:37.748 --> 22:53.912
being dumped in a hurry and not real sure that

22:37.748 --> 22:53.912
we were going to have the civilian as well as 
political support behind it. But the one thing

22:59.392 --> 23:09.666
that concerned me more than anything was the Air 
Corps was still the prodigal son of the Army.

23:15.954 --> 23:22.042
We thought we were our own bosses, but we weren't. 
Why didn't you lie down? Why didn't you like that?

23:25.261 --> 23:26.122
Why didn't I like that? Because I had long since 
believed that

23:27.264 --> 23:41.503
it could have worked a hell of a lot simpler and more 
effective the other way around. That air power

23:41.643 --> 23:46.630
could control where land and sea power had gone 
through history and lost its position and was no

23:47.453 --> 23:55.140
longer there. And I still believe

23:57.563 --> 24:09.974
that.

24:14.879 --> 24:15.840
It didn't hurt. I'd say it didn't hurt. Yeah, it 
deferred promotion and advancement five or six

24:18.116 --> 24:30.095
years, but, you know, in a whole career, what, five 
or six years?

24:33.660 --> 24:40.070
But if you would have stayed in until, if you would 
have stayed in, then for just another couple of

24:33.660 --> 24:40.070
months you would have been a lieutenant colonel. 
Right. When I did go back on active duty, I would

24:42.213 --> 24:47.481
have gone back to the lieutenant colonel, rather 
than . That's the five or six years it would have

24:48.142 --> 24:55.032
saved. At that time, you'd already made up your 
mind to come back to A&M and finish your degree.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.588
Looking back, do you think it was a wise choice?

25:11.457 --> 25:26.421
Well, yes, because I did some things in the five or 
six years that I would never have done that

25:11.457 --> 25:26.421
ultimately

25:11.457 --> 25:26.421
paid off in that secondary role. If you remember, 
first, I wanted to be an officer. Second, I wanted

25:28.524 --> 25:29.907
to be an engineer. I had not really been able to be an 
engineer up until that time.

25:43.891 --> 26:02.279
And

25:43.891 --> 26:02.279
I guess if you had to put it on the scale at all, it 
would tilt to the plus side a whole lot more than it

25:43.891 --> 26:02.279
would to the minus. We had some

26:02.299 --> 26:11.333
very choice things happen. The guy said, good 
news, bad news. Sure, that's through life. But

26:15.362 --> 26:27.113
this,

26:15.362 --> 26:27.113
for instance, this same angel from headquarters, 
he returned to Texas A&M. And sure enough, he ended

26:27.133 --> 26:41.505
up being in a position that when I said, say, Marty 
and I are going to come back and we're going to be in

26:27.133 --> 26:41.505
school another term and a summer. He says, oh, 
we're opening some brand new apartments. And of

26:46.456 --> 26:49.801
course, we're talking now about right after the 
war. But those wooden co-op buildings that are

26:50.141 --> 27:00.997
south of Caulfield, those all used to be co-ops 
where kids came from different farm communities

26:50.141 --> 27:00.997
and lived together and had a house by there. And 
then they made apartments out of them. Four

27:03.372 --> 27:05.035
apartments, two up and two down. Boy, they were 
choice, brand new. We were the first ones to go into

27:07.359 --> 27:13.069
the co-op apartment, thanks to Angel. And he said, 
you got one of those apartments. I said, how'd I get

27:15.713 --> 27:16.695
it? He said, I put your name down. So that's where we 
lived. Again, like I said, I had this eyesight

27:22.725 --> 27:26.612
problem. I certainly couldn't fly, but I had 
enough points built up in the service that while I

27:28.195 --> 27:40.974
was finishing my academics, I took a private pilot 
course right out there at Eastwood. You just learn

27:40.994 --> 27:41.815
to fly. So I would never have done that. I had to pay 
for it if I'd even found the time to do it. So I

27:48.565 --> 27:57.358
satisfied my own curiosity that I now could 
legally do something that I had been doing on the

27:57.524 --> 28:03.630
slide because a lot of these guys had let me take off 
and land and things like that. But now I can if I want

28:03.650 --> 28:08.755
to. I got my license. The only flight I ever did was 
again with guys that would let me take off and land

28:10.477 --> 28:22.528
in the lighter Air Force aircraft.

28:22.548 --> 28:25.371
How had Texas A&M changed? If you hadn't been there 
for now five years, and now you're coming back.

28:31.681 --> 28:35.084
Well, I had to change. See, I hit there right at the 
wave of all the vets coming back. There were a few

28:40.770 --> 28:46.916
there that turned before me, but when I came in is 
when the largest bunch had come in. Now the next,

28:47.076 --> 28:50.299
for summer, there were even more. But everything 
was cold. not co-ed, co-cadet, co-vet. Even the,

29:00.230 --> 29:07.319
see, like I said, the editor of the battalion, they 
were co-editors. One was a cadet, and I was elected

29:07.379 --> 29:11.485
as the vet editor. And you could see it begin to have 
more older people, and people that had, even

29:12.807 --> 29:24.062
though they may be young, had Been off to war for a 
couple years and then come in there. Well, just the

29:26.967 --> 29:29.391
maturity alone, they were older. Now, how long 
that lasted at A&M, I don't know, because I wasn't

29:30.613 --> 29:36.041
there that long. But I guess until those going to 
school on the GI Bill kind of became a strict

29:36.061 --> 29:47.038
minority instead of a heavy minority. I don't 
think they ever outnumbered you. Maybe they did. I

29:51.362 --> 29:52.183
don't know. How are the relationships between 
the... No problem at all. No problem between the

29:56.910 --> 29:59.013
vets and the court kids? Because, you know, you 
have very mature people versus real young, you

29:59.794 --> 30:08.087
know, 17, 18-year-olds. No problem. I don't think 
so. It certainly didn't surface itself during the

30:11.913 --> 30:16.780
time that... But I had the battalion, you know, to 
the point where we really had to fight things out,

30:17.620 --> 30:29.010
you know, or air them in the newspapers

30:17.620 --> 30:29.010
or things like that. No problem.

30:32.943 --> 30:37.348
So you only had, what, 12 credits to go? How many 
credits did you have? 14. I took one whole term, and

30:40.011 --> 30:50.822
because I was in flying, I just stayed on through 
the whole summer rather than get out half of the

30:40.011 --> 30:50.822
summer so that I could take the other half of the 
flying course. Then we went on home. So you

30:54.827 --> 30:56.809
graduated in August of 1946? Yeah.

31:00.297 --> 31:11.830
Now, at that time, when you graduated, did you 
consider, I know you went to work for a civilian

31:00.297 --> 31:11.830
corporation, but did you consider going back into 
the Air Force? Not at

31:11.850 --> 31:16.395
that time. So you wanted to work as an engineer. And 
you did from 1946 to 1951. That's right. And you

31:23.563 --> 31:28.188
were also a reserve officer. And did you go to 
reserve meetings? Not regularly. I went enough to

31:33.673 --> 31:40.161
just keep my status.

31:40.181 --> 31:45.248
So from 1946 to 51, you were the owner-manager of 
Southside Construction. Southstate, yeah.

31:47.430 --> 31:51.476
Yeah, Southstate Construction Company.

31:52.437 --> 31:53.398
Did you do this? If you were the owner-manager, was 
this your own construction company then? Did you

31:58.204 --> 31:59.526
establish it? Yes. What happened was when I came 
out, my dad was engaged in a number of activities.

32:08.428 --> 32:27.085
He was a

32:08.428 --> 32:27.085
plant representative for the Lewis Shepherd 
Company, which manufactures material handling

32:08.428 --> 32:27.085
equipment, lift trucks, dollies, conveyor 
belts, things like that. And then he decided he

32:27.105 --> 32:30.008
wanted to build some houses and sell them. So I went 
to work with him for a few months. Then he decided

32:37.294 --> 32:41.100
that he was going to get out of the business. And I 
said, OK, I don't care about the materials

32:41.120 --> 32:48.992
handling, but I'll stay in the building business. 
Then I went from the building business, which is

32:49.012 --> 33:01.210
straight speculating markets, and decided to go 
into the construction business of bidding on jobs

32:49.012 --> 33:01.210
and doing both commercial and residential work. 
and found it to be very interesting. And one of

33:06.709 --> 33:18.808
these 4-H's, Harold Lewis, he and I got together 
and decided that we would form a partnership. And

33:18.828 --> 33:28.243
not only form a partnership, but because we had 
limited experience that for something like six to

33:28.966 --> 33:43.981
nine months, I would go to work for one of the other 
larger construction firms in Houston as a

33:28.966 --> 33:43.981
superintendent running one of the jobs out on the 
site. And that he would so-called run our

33:44.902 --> 33:54.872
business, but I would also work the business at 
night and on the weekends or whenever I would need

33:44.902 --> 33:54.872
it. Well, that didn't work out. I left the other 
firm and went back and took over the business

33:59.442 --> 34:03.147
myself. I was running the business as the sole 
owner when Uncle said, hey, come on back. Okay, so

34:12.439 --> 34:16.164
the Korean War erupts in June of 1950. And in 1951, 
you were called back in the Air Force? Yeah, I was

34:21.271 --> 34:26.918
called back in the, must have been about, April or 
May of 51. And

34:32.387 --> 34:40.140
first question they asked, do you have any 
government jobs? No. Do you have any jobs that are

34:41.141 --> 34:45.048
government subsidized or guaranteed? It could 
even be a FHA house or a house being built with a VA

34:46.150 --> 34:53.982
loan on it, anything like that. No. How long do you 
think it'll take you to close your business? Three

35:00.834 --> 35:01.314
months? Four months? OK, you got it. Let us know if 
you need more time. So I had to contact them and say,

35:06.841 --> 35:09.685
I need two more months. So December, I was back in. 
Now, it's amazing. So you sold your business, or

35:18.516 --> 35:20.559
what did you do with it? Oh, just closed it up. I had 
some properties. that didn't have any buildings

35:27.125 --> 35:28.627
on it. And I went out and went down and inventoried 
all the materials we had on hand and went to the

35:28.647 --> 35:50.018
design board and designed a building with the 
least amount of cash required using the inventory

35:28.647 --> 35:50.018
and built the building on the property and put some 
renters in it and went back in the circuit. How?

35:50.619 --> 35:54.505
Thinking that someday you'd come back out and 
start it up. I knew that if I ever went back in, I

35:54.525 --> 35:56.828
wasn't going to come out. Then why didn't you just 
sell it? What, the business? Construction

36:01.456 --> 36:06.221
business won't sell.

36:09.545 --> 36:12.107
Unless it's a real big thing. It wasn't heavy 
construction of building highways and bridges

36:13.949 --> 36:19.875
and having an awful lot of equipment. It was a 
building construction where most of your

36:19.895 --> 36:24.520
equipment is. is owned and carried by the 
craftsmen rather than the company. Oh, I had tar

36:30.882 --> 36:33.865
kettles, concrete mixers, trucks. But

36:34.106 --> 36:46.379
at that time, there were too many what I call 
graduate carpenters who thought they wanted to be

36:34.106 --> 36:46.379
contractors. And competition's pretty keen. 
Now, we've got some things on there in the tape Why

36:55.415 --> 36:58.280
didn't we get out and all this? She actually picked 
up the orders and brought them out to my office, my

36:58.300 --> 37:13.048
construction office, where I did the estimating 
and what drawing I had to do and where I kept my

36:58.300 --> 37:13.048
inventory and opened those orders. And I said, 
well, these are orders calling me back to duty.

37:15.813 --> 37:17.777
What do you think we ought to do? what she said i 
think we ought to go back and maybe i'll see more of

37:19.293 --> 37:40.035
you in the service than i have in the construction 
business so in that time she had completely

37:19.293 --> 37:40.035
changed her mind absolutely fantastic

37:19.293 --> 37:40.035
so are you happy to go back oh hell yes sure By that 
time you were happy. Did it have more to do with just

37:42.515 --> 37:49.586
your personal life or with the war in Korea? No. I 
knew I'd never make the war in Korea because that

37:52.611 --> 37:59.422
was already calming down by the time December of 51 
came along. In fact, in December they asked me,

37:59.442 --> 38:03.188
they said, you don't have to come if you don't want 
to. I said, man, you remember that Confederate

38:04.180 --> 38:08.205
general that the heck of a get you got? I've closed a 
business for six months. I've been coming back

38:11.269 --> 38:13.652
into service. And now you tell me I don't have to 
come back? I said, you've got me. You know. But, no,

38:19.559 --> 38:26.668
see, by then, Korea was beginning to calm down. It 
was diminishing. I'd gotten my My degree, I'd

38:33.172 --> 38:46.504
taken courses at the University of Houston in 
design, civil engineer courses that later helped

38:33.172 --> 38:46.504
me towards my master's degree. And I had 
accomplished all that really that I wanted to do.

38:52.550 --> 38:54.152
And I knew that I could run a business.

38:57.795 --> 39:01.018
As a major general once said, I don't have two guys 
on my staff that have ever made a payroll.

39:06.089 --> 39:11.755
Everybody else had come out of school and gone into 
the military, and all they'd seen was that side of

39:06.089 --> 39:11.755
the line. But one other colonel and I, we'd made 
payrolls. We'd suffered. We knew what cash flow

39:17.342 --> 39:18.764
was. We knew what contractors were going through. 
Again, that's this human side that I spoke of

39:22.028 --> 39:26.533
earlier. The more exposure you can get and the more 
different walks of life, the better you are. And

39:33.614 --> 39:35.056
that's what I say. The accounting graduate just 
doesn't have it as compared to that guy at A&M that

39:35.937 --> 39:45.146
can get himself in all types of exposure if he wants 
to. Well,

39:45.166 --> 39:55.457
we went in, and it took a while to get Again, 
engineering and the service, but this time I was

39:55.842 --> 40:01.369
bound and determined. I was not going to be pushed 
off in the administrative or personnel side, even

40:01.389 --> 40:10.980
though I was called back as a personnel staff 
officer because that's what I was when I went out.

40:12.162 --> 40:12.903
It hadn't changed. That's what I was when I came 
back. So we

40:18.069 --> 40:24.837
were sent to Warner Robins, Georgia,

40:27.500 --> 40:37.994
to headquarters of a

40:27.500 --> 40:37.994
numbered air force and administering to the 
reserve personnel. And after a few months of

40:39.756 --> 40:53.794
plowing the ground over there and personnel and 
then agent general's job,

40:39.756 --> 40:53.794
the local personnel people Well, I called on the 
general, the commanding general, which is a

40:55.124 --> 41:02.659
protocol type thing to do. When he found out that I 
was an engineer and I'd been in the construction

41:04.543 --> 41:09.814
business, he liked to have a history. He said, boy, 
you'd be in my office tomorrow morning. We're

41:13.241 --> 41:14.483
going to get that straightened out. Well, out of 
courtesy, I went by because I had friends that were

41:15.492 --> 41:19.998
in the personnel business. I went by and I said, 
hey, yeah, we've heard about it, but just relax.

41:23.802 --> 41:25.925
Nothing's going to happen. What do you mean 
nothing's going to happen? I'm going in there.

41:29.830 --> 41:30.030
Yeah. Went in and he had changed. Turned out I 
outranked his engineer, so he wasn't about to do

41:31.612 --> 41:37.660
anything. So I said, okay, we've got to go around 
that one. If the general's not going to move me into

41:40.723 --> 41:45.229
engineering because I outrank his man, then What 
are we going to do next? So this headquarters,

41:48.602 --> 41:56.431
since it administered to the reserve personnel, 
administered to the ROTC program. And I just went

41:57.913 --> 42:05.743
over and I said, where do you have openings for our 
engineer officers in the ROTC program? He says,

42:07.165 --> 42:11.590
Auburn and Texas A&M. I said, only Auburn. I want 
the one at Texas A&M. And they said, you'll never

42:17.035 --> 42:18.837
get it. I said, why? They said, they won't let you 
go. I said, well, all we can do is try. Well, I put in

42:25.523 --> 42:27.485
an application to go. It was turned down locally,

42:28.986 --> 42:38.095
which meant that it had to go to the next higher 
headquarters. And the next headquarters

42:38.115 --> 42:44.481
concurred with the turn down, which meant it had to 
go to Washington, to the top headquarters. And

42:45.982 --> 42:46.823
Washington Reversed it. It says the Continental 
Air Command and the 14th Air Force will fulfill its

42:49.448 --> 42:56.758
share of assignments to the ROTC program. 
Application approved. How? Well, if I go to Texas

42:59.722 --> 43:05.189
A&M to teach civil engineering, Air Force type. 
Then it was called Air Installation Zone. Now, why

43:07.713 --> 43:09.335
did it even go up? Why wasn't it just killed right 
there on the level? Because any disapproval has to

43:11.438 --> 43:15.223
have a concurrence. Oh, I see. And since it was a 
straight concurrence of the disapproval, it was

43:15.997 --> 43:23.148
subject to Air Force review. So all of a sudden, 
there I am. And I'm at A&M. A&M in the position to

43:28.055 --> 43:33.784
teach air installation. And guess what? They 
changed the curriculum from specialized

43:36.348 --> 43:40.654
curriculum of communications officer, 
installations officer, supply officer,

43:41.866 --> 43:54.343
administrative officer, to a generalized 
curriculum where everybody was taught the same

43:41.866 --> 43:54.343
thing. So for three years I sat there and taught, 
still not teaching engineering, but in a slot

43:55.344 --> 44:04.036
calling for an engineer officer. And that's what 
really made the difference. I was in the slot even

44:05.878 --> 44:09.103
though I wasn't teaching engineering. I was in the 
slot. The Air Force thought that you were, this is

44:12.511 --> 44:16.576
what the Air Force thought. Yeah. They thought 
that you were teaching engineering. Yeah. And

44:22.003 --> 44:26.048
that's how you got into engineering in the Air 
Force finally. When I left A&M, I went up to, do you

44:26.328 --> 44:31.555
know where Mineral Wells is? I've heard of it. It's 
up out of Fort Worth, west of Fort Worth. And we used

44:43.156 --> 44:52.988
to have an air base up there, but the aviation 
engineers were located there at Walters Air Base.

44:53.008 --> 44:56.893
Then the Army later took it over and trained 
helicopter pilots there. And I went up to be in the

44:56.913 --> 45:02.040
aviation engineer force, and from there I went on 
at the end of the engineers. Now,

45:03.141 --> 45:08.488
the... The assignment there at A&M, of course, 
proved quite fruitful because I was able to get my

45:10.527 --> 45:34.502
master's in civil and without incurring any 
federal funds to pay for it and without me

45:10.527 --> 45:34.502
incurring an obligation, a service obligation. 
Of course, that wouldn't bother me. If the service

45:37.266 --> 45:39.589
sends you to school and you inherit an obligation 
to serve so many years. But that didn't bother me.

45:46.155 --> 45:48.398
So you pretty much went on a night school? No. They 
didn't have night school at that time. I went maybe

45:55.667 --> 46:01.195
two courses a semester. And then in the summer, a 
course, just one or two at a time. Of course, I had

46:09.100 --> 46:22.673
steel design, concrete design, and estimating 
that they transferred from the University of

46:09.100 --> 46:22.673
Houston that I had gotten after my bachelor's 
degree. I used

46:22.693 --> 46:38.989
to sit there and envy those other troops that were 
also going to school, taking education. P.E. and

46:42.059 --> 46:43.121
things like that. A

46:43.161 --> 46:51.633
master's in engineering is just like a bachelor's 
in engineering. They don't let up all the hours in

46:51.653 --> 46:55.538
the lab hours that you've got to put in. But I had a 
real good boss. He just said, you make all your

46:58.763 --> 47:08.757
classroom hours and your platform hours and be on 
time.
