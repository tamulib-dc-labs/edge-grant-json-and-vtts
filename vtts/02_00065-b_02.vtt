WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:10.176
which had a lot of descriptive geometry in it.

00:10.196 --> 00:16.244
And then of course there were other courses, but those were the two main courses that all engineers had to take.

00:16.264 --> 00:19.768
Did the students have any nickname for these two courses?

00:21.110 --> 00:26.477
I'm sure they had all kind of vulgarity they could use for almost any course.

00:26.958 --> 00:28.300
Did you have a nickname?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.822
Not that I know of.

00:30.723 --> 00:33.126
Did some of your colleagues have nicknames?

00:34.709 --> 00:37.352
Not that I know of.

00:37.372 --> 00:40.437
I don't remember hearing many engineering nicknames.

00:40.717 --> 00:43.681
Alphabet Thompson, Momsmeang.

00:47.045 --> 00:48.747
Do you remember any others in engineering?

00:56.578 --> 00:58.420
Well, I don't think so, Haskell.

00:58.660 --> 01:02.185
The reason those nicknames are so memorable is there's only about four or five of them on the campus.

01:02.738 --> 01:25.532
Well, Bloody Morgan, Square Root Jackson, Cube Root Kent, Dr. Dan the Grade Point Man, Slick Al Price over Veterinary Medicine, Screamin' Al Nelson, Notes Nance, Jock Woods in Government and Political Science, D.B.

01:25.953 --> 01:31.581
Cofer, Dusty Butt Cofer, Happy Harry Herth,

01:32.388 --> 01:33.089
Harrison Hearth.

01:35.393 --> 01:46.089
Those nicknames always intrigue me because I've always contended that they were, in fact, backhanded terms of affection.

01:46.310 --> 01:51.638
I ain't going to admit that I really like the guy, but I do, so I give him this nickname.

01:51.658 --> 01:59.931
And, of course, also, correct me if you disagree with me, many, many individuals all across society had nicknames then.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.989
in the generation of our parents.

02:05.271 --> 02:06.633
That's right.

02:07.454 --> 02:08.756
There was Shorty and Dude.

02:08.776 --> 02:10.679
If you didn't have a memorable name, you weren't memorable.

02:10.799 --> 02:11.180
That's right.

02:11.780 --> 02:15.005
W. Leo Daniel was Pappy.

02:16.948 --> 02:19.953
There were many people like that.

02:21.255 --> 02:24.940
Was this course considered a tough course by the students as far as you know?

02:26.337 --> 02:34.669
We didn't have a lot of kids flunking, but yeah, they thought it was pretty demanding for us.

02:34.689 --> 02:44.042
Now, in terms of grade point ratio, when you were an undergraduate, did you and your buddies calculate your grade point ratio like students do now?

02:44.647 --> 02:46.829
Did you see us now calculate the grade points?

02:46.849 --> 02:47.350
Oh, yes.

02:47.470 --> 02:48.070
I didn't think so.

02:48.471 --> 02:50.372
But, you know, I've got a 3.2.

02:51.413 --> 02:54.056
Did you all speak in those terms?

02:54.336 --> 02:54.756
Oh, yeah.

02:54.897 --> 02:57.459
Back when I was in school, a C was the average grade.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.019
Yes.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.682
Just like the catalog says, it was an average grade.

03:00.802 --> 03:05.226
And once in a while, somebody would get a D, and they weren't ashamed of that at all.

03:05.306 --> 03:07.548
Of course, we had to make 10 points higher.

03:08.089 --> 03:11.652
Back in those days, we had to have a 70 to get a D. I remember that.

03:11.932 --> 03:12.493
I remember that.

03:13.351 --> 03:15.674
While I'm talking on that, let me tell you the difference.

03:15.734 --> 03:18.959
I want this on tape, as someone might recall.

03:19.520 --> 03:35.041
Since I've been in the educational business, I've heard all these fuzzy-headed people talk about how we have so much more to learn and how we have this academic intelligence information explosion, how the world is just full of all this stuff.

03:35.061 --> 03:36.844
We just can't get on learning at all.

03:37.164 --> 03:41.090
Of course, at least 20% of our people now are functionally illiterate.

03:41.110 --> 03:42.852
I don't know how we got that way, but

03:43.085 --> 03:44.726
They talk about how much more we need to learn.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.790
When I was in school, we had an 18-week semester.

03:48.810 --> 03:51.753
Now we have one or two days beyond 15 weeks.

03:53.394 --> 03:55.136
Now you might say, that doesn't matter.

03:55.156 --> 03:58.218
Well, if that's the case, why don't we have a 10-week semester?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.980
We used to have to make 70 to pass.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.981
Now you can do it with 60.

04:01.201 --> 04:03.623
I've heard grown people say, well, there's no difference in that.

04:03.643 --> 04:04.824
You can make the grades wherever you want.

04:04.844 --> 04:11.590
But it just makes sense to me that if you have a difference of 10 points, it ought to mean something.

04:12.110 --> 04:14.053
We had to make seven.

04:14.073 --> 04:20.222
We had to take PE four semesters and get zero hours, but that took our time.

04:20.242 --> 04:25.369
And we had to take 18, 17, 18 hours per semester.

04:25.389 --> 04:29.014
And your counselors would, boy, they liked your schedule and you were going to take that.

04:29.815 --> 04:30.596
And we did.

04:30.656 --> 04:32.900
Now the kids take more like 10 or 12.

04:33.500 --> 04:37.927
So the difference in the academic load that these kids carry is substantially less.

04:38.688 --> 04:41.712
And what made A&M so doggone outstanding?

04:42.063 --> 04:51.658
The product they put out is the kids who came out the other end might not be real smart, or they might have some defects, but they were tough as hell.

04:51.678 --> 04:52.299
They were tough.

04:52.319 --> 04:58.107
They went through all that crap and somehow juggled everything and kept it afloat to come out.

04:58.448 --> 04:59.309
So you went to the military.

04:59.389 --> 05:01.232
That was the easiest damn game in the world.

05:01.312 --> 05:06.520
If you can't have anyone back to duty, none of the guys in the military was the military as we were.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.563
Oh, let's go back to that.

05:08.663 --> 05:11.007
When you either went to summer camp,

05:11.864 --> 05:22.919
or to active duty, did you realize the difference of your military preparation here at A&M compared to other ROTC programs?

05:22.939 --> 05:24.642
Well, yeah.

05:24.662 --> 05:25.763
Can you give any examples?

05:26.244 --> 05:30.790
Well, you know, we lived in DOQs and barracks and we were at A&M.

05:30.810 --> 05:37.179
You go to service and it's natural, you know, you got indoor plumbing and all that kind of stuff and it's a lot more convenient then.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.504
And it was a step up and

05:40.720 --> 05:46.128
Most of the guys who were our contemporaries had no idea at all about what the military was about.

05:48.893 --> 05:54.982
Back to the quality, how did you talk for about 30 years?

05:55.002 --> 05:56.024
38 years.

05:56.565 --> 06:04.297
About how did the subject matter in your course change in that time?

06:05.298 --> 06:07.622
It went from one of trying to

06:09.931 --> 06:18.362
present drawings of how things are made to being a tool to how you creatively design something.

06:18.382 --> 06:24.550
And take your ideas from the head, put it on paper so you can communicate in a creative fashion your ideas.

06:24.950 --> 06:34.002
And then along came computers, and we want to know how can you use computers to do it mechanically by a keyboard rather than drawing with a pencil.

06:34.382 --> 06:38.908
So those are the two major changes is design and computer graphics.

06:39.445 --> 06:49.797
Now, and when you got here as a student, the engineer proudly carried, and I guess architects did in a few instances, proudly carried their slide rules.

06:52.099 --> 07:03.512
And by the time you finished as a faculty member, some people may have had a handheld calculator and other technical

07:03.577 --> 07:19.260
devices, and your course changed with those, in terms of the preparation of the student who came into your class, how did they compare in the mid-80s compared to the 50s?

07:20.141 --> 07:31.758
They came in with more credentials, and on paper it looked a lot better, but probably were no better than the ones we had back before.

07:31.778 --> 07:33.060
All those credentials we got

07:33.665 --> 07:35.167
What do you call it?

07:35.187 --> 07:36.209
Expanding?

07:36.369 --> 07:36.890
Exploded?

07:36.950 --> 07:40.796
There's some word that means overblown.

07:41.818 --> 07:49.750
And really felt like a lot of our kids are missing a lot of fundamental understanding of school.

07:50.050 --> 07:59.024
And as we all know, the public schools have come under great criticism and have many shortcomings and looks like it's here to stay for a while.

07:59.044 --> 08:01.528
But our credentials of our students

08:02.133 --> 08:05.717
read much better, but in reality in the classroom, I didn't expect them.

08:05.737 --> 08:07.279
I didn't notice them being that much better.

08:08.000 --> 08:18.892
What we don't have now that we used to have are these guys, and I say guys because that's all we had, male types.

08:18.912 --> 08:25.100
They were here trying to be survivors, but they were strongly directed.

08:27.222 --> 08:29.845
They would hold in there, and the kids today will not.

08:30.652 --> 08:33.522
You know, there are a lot of kids that walk in the class finding who's teaching and walk out.

08:34.906 --> 08:36.452
We didn't do it in that day.

08:36.632 --> 08:38.157
That was our class and that was our teacher.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.565
Boy, he wasn't going to get the best of us.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.231
Did...

08:43.443 --> 08:53.035
Did the background in terms of geography and so forth, the chain of the students change much in those 30 years plus?

08:53.436 --> 08:54.717
Like where the students came from?

08:55.178 --> 08:56.199
Well, heck yeah.

08:56.219 --> 09:00.364
Foreign students are numerous, and foreign faculty are numerous.

09:00.384 --> 09:07.133
And if we let our borders down, we'd be overrun with foreign students.

09:07.353 --> 09:10.497
What about here in Texas?

09:10.949 --> 09:16.655
where more of them, was a larger percentage of them urban in the later years?

09:17.335 --> 09:23.302
I think Harris County furnished the greatest number of students then, and they do now, always will.

09:23.402 --> 09:28.026
And whatever you call them, I guess there's some country people in Houston, but that's the biggest city we have.

09:28.787 --> 09:30.429
So you'd have to call them city people.

09:30.909 --> 09:32.411
I think everyone's a city person now.

09:32.431 --> 09:32.891
Oh, I agree.

09:32.911 --> 09:35.114
There's no such thing as a country person.

09:36.054 --> 09:39.538
Did anybody in any

09:39.603 --> 09:48.315
position of authority or assumed authority attempt to tell you ever what you should teach or not teach?

09:51.740 --> 09:51.800
No.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.944
So nobody ever tried to look over you?

09:54.965 --> 09:55.625
Well, yeah.

09:56.046 --> 10:04.598
We get together and work a course syllabi and stuff like that, but as an instructive disciplinary sort of

10:05.067 --> 10:05.648
Guidance?

10:05.988 --> 10:06.228
No.

10:06.448 --> 10:10.272
No dean, no department head ever said, uh-uh, do this, that.

10:10.772 --> 10:11.092
Oh, no.

10:11.353 --> 10:14.595
Of course, I wasn't going to be one that needed to be told.

10:17.858 --> 10:22.603
Did you have some favorite colleagues that you cherished during all these years?

10:23.804 --> 10:25.585
Some friends whose company you enjoyed?

10:25.605 --> 10:25.785
Oh, yeah.

10:25.805 --> 10:26.226
All those people.

10:26.246 --> 10:27.227
Every one of them, sure.

10:27.247 --> 10:30.089
But who were some of them that you most cherished?

10:30.109 --> 10:33.252
Well, the guy I left the program with was named Richard Squirani.

10:34.109 --> 10:42.637
And, you know, Stark and Oliver Cleland and Matt Whiteacre and Bob Bolton.

10:45.900 --> 10:50.905
Ranstle was in our department, but he had gone to the dean's office by the time I was teaching over there.

10:52.086 --> 10:55.489
And, yeah, all of those guys were nice fellows.

10:55.950 --> 11:02.496
Describe Ranstle as a student advisor and counselor.

11:03.337 --> 11:14.029
All I know is sort of standing around the edge of the perimeter when he was talking to kids, but that seemed to be what he was most gifted at, talking to kids.

11:14.089 --> 11:17.353
He seemed to be a guy who truly loved talking to kids.

11:18.454 --> 11:24.621
He did a pretty good job remembering where they were and just liked to hold forth and talk to them.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.863
He had them in his office all the time.

11:27.282 --> 11:30.306
They were very lucky to have him.

11:31.087 --> 11:36.093
And I was lucky to have him too because I had much rather teach kids and counsel kids.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.534
Because they used to divide freshmen up.

11:37.554 --> 11:39.997
We'd have about 10 apiece per semester.

11:41.319 --> 11:43.902
And the kid would come over and, all right, we're going to talk.

11:43.942 --> 11:45.464
And you have this course and I have trouble.

11:45.484 --> 11:47.987
And you need to study and do that, blah, blah, blah.

11:48.007 --> 11:48.968
And you come back next week.

11:48.988 --> 11:49.909
Well, I didn't do any good.

11:50.030 --> 11:50.570
Well, what's wrong?

11:50.610 --> 11:52.232
Well, try studying with an album.

11:52.272 --> 11:53.033
Try that next week.

11:54.215 --> 11:55.416
You go on and on and on.

11:55.987 --> 12:06.840
You finally feel that you can appreciate the counselors who do that full-time because you seem to have these kids that would rather talk about their problem than do something about it.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.843
And Rams will do a good job of that.

12:08.863 --> 12:11.266
But he came along back in the day when he did have send something home.

12:11.887 --> 12:19.856
Now, back when you were a student, if you had had a real problem that you needed some advice on, who would you have turned to?

12:22.179 --> 12:23.040
Some of our classmates.

12:24.362 --> 12:24.542
There.

12:24.725 --> 12:37.141
And what I'm really asking, was there someone, a Randall-like advisor counselor then that you... I'm sure there must have been people that had titles like that, but I never thought it would pay out.

12:37.161 --> 12:41.186
I just thought he was there more or less for a job, and they justified their position, and they were there.

12:41.206 --> 12:43.029
But all in all, they can't take a test for him.

12:43.049 --> 12:44.771
I mean, what the hell do I need to say?

12:45.011 --> 12:45.872
You can do it, kid.

12:45.892 --> 12:47.374
Get in here and do it.

12:47.394 --> 12:51.099
You know, I feel silly having someone to tell me that, and I say, oh, that's all it took.

12:51.279 --> 12:52.521
Just tell me to go get him.

12:53.345 --> 12:54.506
I say, I know one.

12:55.528 --> 13:06.501
Describe for somebody that was not there to see it, registration, student registration at one of the long semesters, fall or spring.

13:06.521 --> 13:16.412
Long semester registration always began with taking a lot of big sheet of cards that you fill out your name and address and home address on and what dorm room you're living in.

13:16.813 --> 13:18.795
And you do that about a dozen times.

13:19.180 --> 13:24.767
And then these were perforated and they'd tear apart, and somewhere or other they'd go to different places, and you'd pay your fees to do that.

13:25.287 --> 13:28.591
But it seemed like you had about 30 minutes of just filling out forms each and every time.

13:29.532 --> 13:35.980
And then you had a big line, and then they had it by letters A through C are going to come through this door.

13:36.921 --> 13:39.364
And you finally make it in at certain prescribed times.

13:39.484 --> 13:39.805
Now where?

13:40.566 --> 13:41.667
The door to what building?

13:41.827 --> 13:42.448
Sebiza Hall.

13:43.329 --> 13:48.495
And sometimes they had a couple of doors, and they said that if you're

13:48.779 --> 13:50.681
Last name begins with this letter.

13:51.161 --> 13:52.182
You'll come in at 10.

13:52.302 --> 13:54.645
If it begins with this, you come in at 8.

13:54.665 --> 14:07.577
So they had you staggered out during the day, so it was a little bit tricky sometimes to get a section that you needed, because they would fill up, but they were fairly flexible, I think, where they could maybe in some cases add additional sections.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.759
Then we'd go to table to table.

14:10.359 --> 14:18.347
We'd go to English to get an English course, and go to the engineering table for that particular course, and we'd go to architecture for that course,

14:18.631 --> 14:43.675
All the courses we took, we'd go table to table, stand in line, we'd come up and ask for a section, they'd write your name down, and they'd give you some kind of a slip that you'd go out with, and at the tail end of registration, they'd take all your slips, figure your fees, you'd turn down all these cards you filled out, and the deans obviously had to sign up on your program that you were taking that semester, and that would do it.

14:43.695 --> 14:46.478
It took, I guess, about an hour to do the whole thing.

14:47.048 --> 14:55.119
And after you became a faculty member, that process remained the same for a long time, didn't it?

14:55.139 --> 14:56.681
I don't remember now exactly when I switched.

14:56.701 --> 14:59.524
I must stay there until about 1970 or so.

14:59.745 --> 15:06.874
Because I remember Sebesa, occasionally in G. Riley White, particularly in the summer.

15:07.175 --> 15:08.797
Back to when you were a faculty member.

15:09.838 --> 15:11.400
Describe your office.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.643
How big was it and where was it?

15:13.663 --> 15:15.165
The office I had as a

15:16.816 --> 15:21.382
Let's see, starting over in Anchor Hall in the old building where we were over there.

15:21.883 --> 15:28.071
I was over in Anchor Hall, I guess, one year before they moved out.

15:28.111 --> 15:37.603
The first thing they did over there, they put a new roof on it and then moved us out and tore it down.

15:37.623 --> 15:40.647
But my office area was about the size of this room.

15:41.268 --> 15:44.493
I guess that'd be about 15, about 20-something, a lot like that.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.536
And we had about four desks in it.

15:46.936 --> 15:50.502
Each faculty member had a desk in some corner of the room.

15:50.522 --> 15:53.206
And it was sort of a bulletin arrangement.

15:53.246 --> 15:59.795
And then they moved us over where we went to what is called the new engineering building.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.319
And that was tall cotton, I guess.

16:02.459 --> 16:05.864
And I had a... Usually when you move, you go into smaller quarters.

16:05.985 --> 16:07.647
We had a room about the size of...

16:08.774 --> 16:11.658
Yeah, about the size of his carpet here, and about three of us had this, didn't it?

16:13.181 --> 16:15.825
And... Now, the new engineering building, that's not Zachary.

16:16.245 --> 16:19.711
No, the new engineering building is right across the street from Ag Engineering.

16:19.731 --> 16:20.031
Oh, yes.

16:20.252 --> 16:22.475
Right behind Chemistry and right in that area.

16:22.575 --> 16:25.520
Sort of looks out in the Ag building.

16:25.540 --> 16:26.962
And that's called the new engineering building.

16:26.982 --> 16:29.025
That's where the dean was on the second floor.

16:30.367 --> 16:34.554
And Mickey McGuire was on the second floor with him in the Ransel head office there.

16:35.575 --> 16:37.498
So, we all...

16:37.782 --> 16:45.531
At my rank, instructor, we were all stuck together in this bullpen.

16:45.591 --> 16:52.679
And senior faculty had little offices a little bit bigger on their desk with a chair and a file cabinet.

16:52.699 --> 17:00.188
Now, as you were in your earliest years, who was the senior person in terms of longevity in the department?

17:00.208 --> 17:03.251
Was there any kind of grandfather type?

17:03.912 --> 17:04.853
Yeah.

17:04.968 --> 17:08.112
the time I came on board, it looked like everybody was close to being a grandfather.

17:09.634 --> 17:25.594
The guy who was Striegel was, I guess he was about, when I was on board there, he must have been about 60, I guess, or something in that range of age.

17:25.614 --> 17:29.018
Had another guy about 58, 59,

17:29.386 --> 17:31.249
two or three others in their fifties.

17:31.269 --> 17:35.695
And you and your colleagues thought they were ancient, of course, of those years.

17:37.337 --> 17:40.621
Now, let's jump now to the end of your career.

17:41.262 --> 17:43.706
Where were y'all quartered then?

17:44.947 --> 17:57.364
We were in, I think it was called the TTI Building, Engineering TTI Building, and it was next door, and it had a lab building attached to it.

17:57.384 --> 17:58.566
It was right behind the Petroleum Engineering.

17:59.828 --> 18:03.892
But behind the engineering, what is that name?

18:03.912 --> 18:04.873
That's the guy in Tyler.

18:09.037 --> 18:11.700
Anyway, it's behind the DNC engineering building.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.682
It's called the TTI engineering building.

18:13.742 --> 18:20.008
There's some cantankerous guys from the board direction for a long time.

18:20.068 --> 18:20.628
Weismaker.

18:21.229 --> 18:22.951
Yeah, Weismaker.

18:22.971 --> 18:29.397
So he had a building, and it was right next to, between that building and Zachary, and we were in that eight-story building.

18:29.883 --> 18:34.616
Did you ever have much overlap with John Calhoun?

18:34.916 --> 18:36.059
If so, describe him.

18:37.884 --> 18:42.918
John Calhoun is one of those guys I haven't mentioned before that I have always had great admiration for.

18:42.978 --> 18:46.407
I agree.

18:46.707 --> 18:52.193
John is a guy that has not changed in appearance since the day I first saw him.

18:53.034 --> 19:01.103
And I don't know, I think he died and he has some robot he left behind that looked like him because he has not changed in any doggone way.

19:01.904 --> 19:11.094
But I respect him as a guy who is smart and he's under control.

19:11.114 --> 19:16.140
I never have heard somebody say, you hear what that doggone

19:16.542 --> 19:31.737
fool John Calhoun said, just like you hear what that guy Earl might have said, but he didn't hear that about Calhoun, and I had great admiration for him and admired him, and he rose to the top in any group he was in.

19:31.757 --> 19:34.900
So I had great respect for John, and I consider him a good friend.

19:37.502 --> 19:45.570
What, try to review in your thinking the whole span, what were the things that A&M did right?

19:47.288 --> 19:51.032
What were the decisions, the practices, the policies?

19:54.135 --> 19:57.578
Boy, that is a hard question, Haskell.

19:57.818 --> 20:15.135
I think what A&M did right was what made them what they were, is just being A&M and being deliberate in any changes that they made and having some strong

20:15.622 --> 20:22.072
senior people that folks felt like, boy, if you're at A&M and that guy there said it, you'd put that in the bank.

20:22.693 --> 20:31.467
And that solid respect that came from A&M before we started this concept that a lot of academicians say, hey, I got an idea.

20:31.908 --> 20:36.415
Why don't we just throw everything out and start off with a clean slate?

20:36.535 --> 20:39.059
We'll just pretend we don't have any background or any experience at all.

20:39.079 --> 20:41.443
We're going to come up with this nice, keen idea how the

20:41.828 --> 20:47.873
Everybody ought to be handled and how all the freshmen ought to be handled or how all the seniors ought to be handled or not handled.

20:48.354 --> 20:54.199
And you have to really resist and fight to keep somebody from, you know, throwing the baby out with a wash.

20:54.599 --> 21:01.205
Because I always assumed that everything ADM did came about from experience and from reason and sanity.

21:01.585 --> 21:03.247
And it was an evolutionary process.

21:03.287 --> 21:09.252
And we didn't just wake up one day and be where we were, but we had gotten there because we worked hard at being in that station.

21:09.272 --> 21:11.734
But there was a group of people who came on board.

21:11.984 --> 21:17.289
maybe even with the dictate of coming in and doing something different.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.652
We once in a while would come up with that way of thinking, and sometimes it surprises me.

21:20.672 --> 21:24.336
I see some people I thought were pretty stable that would make those suggestions.

21:24.356 --> 21:39.831
I think A&M having the respect across the state, a lot of people made fun of A&M, and yeah, a bunch of Aggies wearing uniforms and stuff like that, but there was a great deal of respect for the students of A&M,

21:40.402 --> 21:45.327
And the people who taught school down here and our graduates did damn good.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.970
So I don't know how you could improve on a situation like that.

21:48.010 --> 21:55.279
If you have respect as a student and as a faculty member and as an employee after you leave school, that's as good as it gets.

21:55.899 --> 22:01.686
Did you have any personal reaction to co-education, non-compulsory core?

22:01.826 --> 22:02.687
All of us hated it.

22:02.827 --> 22:07.913
None of us wanted it, but we knew we had to have it.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.155
And President Rutter, any questions?

22:10.895 --> 22:33.392
uh evaluation of him yeah i described rudder as a man who never did anything that he didn't truly believe in as being the best thing to do whatever he did he did it because he had one motive because he felt that was the best thing to do and he was a man of the hour when he came along and he made a m marks behind

22:33.845 --> 22:40.535
the banner of Let's Go Co-Ed, and matter of fact, he did it and got so much support, he didn't realize how much support he had.

22:40.555 --> 22:43.059
He almost got run over by the parade.

22:43.600 --> 22:48.667
But Rutter was the man that made it work, and no one else, I don't think in the state, could have done the job that he did.

22:49.248 --> 22:50.029
I agree with you.

22:50.049 --> 22:51.952
He came down here with his own constituency.

22:52.773 --> 22:56.279
So when Earl Rutter was talking, he was bigger than just some.

22:56.299 --> 22:58.021
Jay who had got a Ph.D.

22:58.041 --> 22:58.322
degree.

22:59.163 --> 23:00.645
He was an important celebrity.

23:00.693 --> 23:08.221
I always say that no one could point to him as not being an Aggie or a Texan or that he was a fuddy-daddy Ph.D.

23:08.241 --> 23:14.909
from somewhere way away that was just passing through or that he didn't work hard or that... He was a bonafide hero.

23:15.109 --> 23:17.451
Yeah, yeah.

23:17.471 --> 23:21.356
Let's see, did you have any evaluation of Dr. Williams, of Jack Williams?

23:25.060 --> 23:29.805
No, I shook hands with him occasionally and he might have known who I was.

23:30.157 --> 23:36.764
I heard a lot of people brag on him, but from the distance I was from him, I wasn't in a position to evaluate him much.

23:36.884 --> 23:45.373
I always sort of felt like he was giving more praise than he might have deserved because it never trickled down to my level how outstanding he was.

23:45.453 --> 23:46.955
So that's about all I can say.

23:47.315 --> 23:47.675
Right.

23:47.695 --> 23:58.847
As you review that same third of the century, can you think of any decisions that A&M made which now in hindsight maybe shouldn't have made?

24:03.839 --> 24:10.970
Boy, that's difficult to run that 40 years through my brain.

24:11.150 --> 24:25.432
Again, recall that they've hired some people that turned out to be duds, and no need to tell their names, but they've hired some people that had all kinds of credentials.

24:25.452 --> 24:30.960
And you've got to finally realize that credentials are

24:32.290 --> 24:36.053
can be falsified or they don't really tell the story.

24:36.073 --> 24:42.739
I mean, a lot of people have some credentials that in a particular job at A&M aren't good.

24:45.582 --> 24:46.342
All right, let's see.

24:46.643 --> 25:00.475
As we get near the end of all this, what are some of your proudest Aggie moments, either as a student or a faculty member or now a retiree?

25:07.711 --> 25:11.295
I don't think I have any real single high points.

25:11.595 --> 25:33.718
I've always been extremely proud of A&M, and I think just the stability that A&M had, and I guess if there's a mistake of it, can be generalized A&M made, and I don't know how you get away from it, is somehow damaging that continuity, where you have stability and continuity where people

25:34.458 --> 25:39.183
in position and what happens down here is expected and desirable when it does happen.

25:40.504 --> 25:50.014
I think we've gone through some times where we've experimented a little bit too much with our program.

25:50.034 --> 25:51.856
But I don't have any key points.

25:51.936 --> 26:03.368
I think my pride in AM is just being a part of AM because I always thought I hired a bunch of part-time graduate students to teach on occasion.

26:03.955 --> 26:07.019
God deliver me from drafting someone to teach.

26:07.980 --> 26:08.882
Sometimes that is done.

26:08.922 --> 26:11.225
Well, the dean said, yeah, you go down there and see Earl.

26:11.245 --> 26:12.106
They put you in the classroom.

26:12.126 --> 26:21.519
The guy said, yeah, I don't know if I'm going to teach this stuff or not, but I always thought that someone who had a chance to teach the A&M would have something he could brag about the rest of his life.

26:23.702 --> 26:29.209
And nearly everybody that I had working for me after they had taught felt that way.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.532
But it is possible.

26:31.765 --> 26:39.433
For someone to be drafted, and once you get in that situation where you got some guy you're sort of trying to cram in a square hole, they drag their feet.

26:39.453 --> 26:53.147
But I think A&M, being what it was, as stable and as structured as A&M was, and having the good people that it had and the good record that it had, I just think it just made for pride all the way through it.

26:53.707 --> 26:59.173
And it disappointed me when we got a little bit away from it and we had people who came on board who didn't show up at the office

26:59.710 --> 27:02.194
people you couldn't count on to do what they said they were going to do.

27:03.576 --> 27:10.767
You got a new dean who said, well once in a while he comes in, but Wednesday's his day, he doesn't show up much, and when he does he leaves early and so forth so on.

27:10.787 --> 27:12.049
That comes into play now.

27:12.069 --> 27:19.341
You take a guy like Dane Benson, if you had three guys that you wanted him to show up for and give a talk to, if it was a 30 minute talk or an hour talk, he'd be there.

27:19.361 --> 27:23.687
All you had to do was tell him where and when and he would show up.

27:24.068 --> 27:25.971
And he was a businessman on the campus.

27:26.558 --> 27:27.820
three major jobs.

27:27.840 --> 27:32.405
And since he left, I guess they hired five administrators to fill in on what he was doing by himself.

27:35.209 --> 27:40.215
As you look back, what did it mean to you that you went to school at Texas A&M?

27:40.235 --> 27:49.025
Well, it was pretty much a rehash of what I got through saying it was one of those things that you felt like you were just superior to everybody else.

27:49.806 --> 27:55.333
You had proven something besides just going to school and passing courses.

27:55.651 --> 28:02.481
Putting up with all the horsemen here was more of a challenge than what you were prouder of than just making the grades.

28:04.544 --> 28:11.234
A kid goes to school now and lives over here in the third floor of some apartment two miles off campus and takes seven years to graduate.

28:11.855 --> 28:14.318
And I don't care what his grades are, he didn't get what we got.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.563
I think I agree with you.

28:18.004 --> 28:21.709
Like, I wish that we didn't have so many living off campus.

28:22.195 --> 28:25.858
We've got kids that have never done anything that they didn't want to do.

28:26.059 --> 28:26.339
That's right.

28:26.699 --> 28:28.220
And everything we did, we didn't want to do.

28:30.603 --> 28:40.952
What are some of your favorite Aggie stories, tales, anecdotes?

28:40.972 --> 28:45.336
You know, I'm the worst interview in the world since I created so much of that stuff.

28:45.977 --> 28:47.618
I don't pay much attention to it.

28:47.698 --> 28:51.882
I don't even read funny papers when I was a cartoonist for 33 years.

28:52.216 --> 28:58.245
But don't you have some where they're, you know, like, I know you're not going to believe this, but this really did happen, or once upon a time?

28:59.026 --> 29:02.371
Yeah, we had all sort of crazy things happen.

29:02.391 --> 29:07.258
They're sort of childish, and, you know, they happen anywhere and anytime.

29:07.318 --> 29:11.944
It's just not that important as a life that I can recall.

29:11.964 --> 29:13.466
You know, we've had these things.

29:15.489 --> 29:18.013
Oh, yeah.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.455
Went one time on a...

29:20.178 --> 29:43.163
track team when we were riding one of these long cars that had a bunch of seats in them and Colonel Anderson was driving in, I forget who, Darren Hooper and somebody sitting up in the front seat and he drove that damn thing in low gear almost all the way to, what's the town down here, not Massville, was it?

29:43.183 --> 29:43.483
Absoe.

29:43.644 --> 29:44.204
Absoe.

29:44.805 --> 29:48.649
And the car, he said, boy this car doesn't need to pick it up, driving along in that

29:48.848 --> 29:51.552
And that's just, you know, anecdotes sort of thing.

29:51.592 --> 29:55.638
And finally the guys up front were just about to cave in because they wouldn't tell him he was in low gear.

29:56.380 --> 30:04.392
And you have those sort of things that weren't planned and weren't set up and they weren't pranks, but just natural things that occur.

30:04.592 --> 30:06.495
And he finally found out about it.

30:07.377 --> 30:10.261
It's just that chunk of life that happens to everybody everywhere.

30:10.281 --> 30:12.464
It has nothing to do with it being in.

30:12.484 --> 30:17.472
Did any of the students ever try to pull any prank on you as a teacher?

30:18.278 --> 30:23.423
that you were called in class or near class or anything?

30:23.624 --> 30:26.567
Oh, sometimes I'd write city stuff on a blackboard or something like that.

30:27.347 --> 30:32.132
Good natured fun, but nothing of any seriousness.

30:32.152 --> 30:36.657
I had a roommate, Bobby Jack Rose, he was in shop butter.

30:39.119 --> 30:42.022
This kind of stuff I don't like with the band.

30:42.042 --> 30:47.408
We were in Hart Hall and he always had these fenders, you know, where you combed your hair

30:47.793 --> 30:48.874
Did all this all the time.

30:49.455 --> 30:51.416
It was back in Day of the Duck Tales and all that.

30:51.436 --> 30:56.121
And he was the first thing he did to come in the room and start combing his hair, and they teased him about that all the time.

30:56.141 --> 31:04.429
So one of the jerks next door in our suite came over and took the mirror out of the medicine cabinet, turned the thing around backwards, put it back in.

31:04.869 --> 31:06.210
So this is going to be a good prank.

31:06.230 --> 31:07.792
It took him 30 minutes to do that.

31:09.113 --> 31:13.497
For the impact, it would last 10 seconds, maybe.

31:14.058 --> 31:16.500
You walk in the mirror, and you don't see yourself.

31:16.953 --> 31:20.440
take some scotch tape and cover the papers on it.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.081
He did this.

31:21.642 --> 31:27.313
And I walked in and said, now, guy, you're going to have to come back in and turn that thing around.

31:27.373 --> 31:35.229
Now, if you break it and get us in trouble, you know, we've got to go talk to the real property people and get it straightened out and they'll fuss at us and so forth and so on.

31:35.249 --> 31:36.872
Yeah, well, I'll be okay.

31:36.892 --> 31:39.417
So he did that and he had his four-second
