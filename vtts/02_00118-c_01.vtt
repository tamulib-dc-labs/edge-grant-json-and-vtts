WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:08.948
I had the students do this scenario. I had a

00:08.968 --> 00:16.396
gentleman that was a little bit strange, but he had 
been a corps commander at one time. And he comes in

00:17.337 --> 00:22.062
wearing a saber, and I'm thinking he's going to 
really give us something. He pulls the saber out.

00:24.144 --> 00:29.370
He's running around the classroom with that 
saber, and I'm saying, is he going to stab

00:24.144 --> 00:29.370
somebody? He got someone fired up in his 
presentation. And I'm thinking, do I stop this or

00:32.650 --> 00:35.613
what do I do? That was one of the most disconcerting 
things that ever happened to me. Later it was kind

00:39.676 --> 00:48.784
of funny, but at the time I'm thinking, he was so 
pumped up and fired up, he was jabbing at this, he'd

00:39.676 --> 00:48.784
say the Senate does this or the state does this. It 
was sort of an anti-government kind of

00:49.345 --> 00:55.350
presentation, even though he was supposed to be 
successful in those kinds of things. I think he'd

00:55.710 --> 00:58.973
probably just gone through a divorce and the 
courts had ripped him out. That was a I've often

01:01.473 --> 01:08.364
thought about, and that taught me a lesson about 
what a person can bring into a class and what

01:01.473 --> 01:08.364
they're going to do in a presentation. I've had 
some fun times, too, when I'll have scenarios. One

01:17.237 --> 01:22.185
time I said, all right, you've got to be creative 
with your scenario. Well, here they come. My class

01:23.787 --> 01:25.229
is right down the hall. Here they come carrying a 
guy in on a gurney. Covered up. all this equipment

01:30.481 --> 01:32.103
hanging off of him. Well, they had frozen him in 
time. So he sets up with a sheet on his head, you

01:36.247 --> 01:39.991
know, all white like a dead man. They pull the sheet 
down and push a few buttons, you know, and he rubs

01:40.292 --> 01:50.123
the stuff off his face, and then he goes into his, 
you know, what's happened to the world since he was

01:40.292 --> 01:50.123
frozen.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.908
That was one of the great ones, I think. What 
about...

02:01.025 --> 02:08.518
Oh,

02:01.025 --> 02:08.518
you know, we hear all kinds of stories about 
excuses given. I, you know, I've never really had

02:10.000 --> 02:17.172
any that come to mind that were absurd. I have 
students who are coming, they can't make it

02:17.493 --> 02:25.446
because the school board president called them, 
they couldn't come the last second, or... I'm new

02:25.814 --> 02:29.401
dog it eat my homework kind of stuff. I haven't had 
much of that those kinds of things at this level. No

02:33.490 --> 02:34.252
excuses. I try early on and say that you're gonna 
miss a class. Professionals will have to do that.

02:40.044 --> 02:41.246
Just let me know beforehand. I want you to bring a 
tape recorder to one of your friends the week

02:41.306 --> 02:44.633
before. Don't expect notes to do the job. I want you 
to tape what goes on in class. And they've really

02:49.185 --> 02:51.907
been good at that for the last 20 some odd years. So 
unless I'm totally naive, I have not had much

02:51.967 --> 03:05.420
problem with even worrying about excuses.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.923
They'll commute from San Antonio quite often. 
Three hours, that's a tough drive. Austin, quite

03:11.165 --> 03:13.607
frequently. We have a doctoral program where we 
have actually bypassed the University of Texas

03:14.279 --> 03:20.667
because they didn't have an EDD program. They had 
the old traditional PhD program. We got this

03:23.510 --> 03:26.313
through the work of David Erlandson and some 
others. We've got these awesome cohort

03:26.333 --> 03:31.159
principals coming in here and doing their 
doctorate. And their superintendent gives them

03:31.179 --> 03:36.305
every other Friday off to do that.

03:37.727 --> 03:44.235
But then I have students driving in from Waco 
probably each week. as far as over in East Texas,

03:44.992 --> 03:54.604
Beaumont.

03:54.704 --> 03:55.845
Yes, yes. And now we're doing a cohort master's 
program with Sy Ferry right on this side of

03:56.366 --> 04:01.272
Houston. We have several from Prairie View in our 
doctoral program in the community. That's a nice

04:06.318 --> 04:10.523
run now, about 50 minutes with a 290 over. But the 
other side of Houston, not much. They'll go to U of H

04:12.406 --> 04:14.408
or Clear Lake. Well,

04:14.776 --> 04:33.153
I think the research on culture and climate of 
schools has got a lot of visibility. I've

04:33.193 --> 04:38.398
developed some instruments on measuring 
ambience or feeling. The research on a book that I

04:39.259 --> 04:43.703
did on co-authored with Fenwick English and Betty 
Steffi, Skills for 21st Century School Leaders,

04:44.037 --> 05:01.041
Skills for Successful 21st Century School 
Leaders, where we had to do a lot of research on what

04:44.037 --> 05:01.041
the big issues were, what the research is telling 
us about the kind of skills that leaders need. And I

05:01.502 --> 05:12.137
think probably then the work, the research that 
I've done on future studies and making it

05:01.502 --> 05:12.137
applicable to success of individuals and 
corporations, those areas. I've written quite a

05:17.882 --> 05:19.504
bit in those areas.

05:24.228 --> 05:39.523
Probably at Texas A&M since 75, I'd say

05:24.228 --> 05:39.523
roughly 50, 55 maybe.

05:41.725 --> 05:41.905
. Professor at UTA. He won the National 
Dissertation Award. I'm sorry, UTSA, San

05:47.943 --> 05:51.046
Antonio. I'm sorry, good point. Yeah, he's just 
gone to University of Texas, San Antonio. His

05:57.132 --> 06:04.619
dissertation was, and I don't take all the credit 
for that, we co-chaired that, Jim McNamara and I

05:57.132 --> 06:04.619
co-chaired it. It won the AERA Dissertation of the 
Year Award and the NCPEA Professor's Year Award.

06:09.905 --> 06:11.166
Very proud of him. Proud of John Wilson, 
superintendent of schools down in Clear Creek.

06:18.340 --> 06:21.765
Very proud of the Belton superintendent, Harold 
Rahm. H-M? R-A-M-M,

06:24.568 --> 06:30.976
yeah. And Jim Boyle, superintendent of schools in 
Temple. They've done extremely well. I've got

06:40.492 --> 06:54.008
students, a superintendent in Greenville, 
students, deputy superintendents up in, two of

06:40.492 --> 06:54.008
them up in Louisville. In fact, I'll be going up 
there soon to work with that school. Those are some

07:00.056 --> 07:03.260
of the notables. Others are in higher education, 
different places. Elaine Wilmore. is running at

07:09.820 --> 07:15.726
the UTA Arlington program as one of my proteges. So 
those are some that I'm really proud of. Let's make

07:20.610 --> 07:34.084
believe now you're the new consultant to the Texas 
A&M administration as to what it ought to do about

07:20.610 --> 07:34.084
for the College of Education. Okay. I think the 
first thing the president and the provost In spite

07:41.022 --> 07:54.073
of the, we have a university system initiative now 
to create, make it possible to produce more

07:41.022 --> 07:54.073
teachers and get the whole system involved in 
that. But one of the first things I would do without

07:55.395 --> 08:06.644
question is say this university, one of its 
highest priorities, is to develop the finest

07:55.395 --> 08:06.644
teachers that have ever been developed. That it's 
an entire university responsibility. that the

08:10.435 --> 08:16.081
sciences and the liberal arts, we're going to try 
to select the best and brightest to come into

08:10.435 --> 08:16.081
teaching. We're obviously going to push for 
higher salaries. But we want the finest teaching

08:19.345 --> 08:22.047
force. And I think the president, the provost, and 
the other deans may fight that if they're going to

08:22.067 --> 08:28.114
lose money. But if they weren't going to lose 
money, I think they would get behind that. And same

08:32.098 --> 08:35.662
thing for public school administrators. And work 
with the College of Business, perhaps with

08:35.682 --> 08:40.307
sociology and the Bush School on Public Affairs, 
and develop a kind of leadership program for

08:40.810 --> 08:46.316
schools that would be the best in the world. Okay, 
now you're the consultant now to the College of

08:47.737 --> 08:51.881
Education.

08:55.065 --> 08:55.345
Okay. I think the College of Education right now, 
in my opinion, exists, it has multiple missions,

08:56.046 --> 09:10.260
but its primary mission is to improve the teaching 
administration, counseling for public schools

09:10.561 --> 09:15.205
of Texas and the nation. We have people majoring in 
things in this college that has no interest in or no

09:16.266 --> 09:22.432
link to public education. I would take a close look 
at that and say if you're in a college of education,

09:23.733 --> 09:40.028
we should be one way or another interested in using 
our talents to make sure that every child in this

09:23.733 --> 09:40.028
state had the kind of education that they 
deserved, your child and other child. And that

09:43.549 --> 09:45.693
everyone in this college is involved one way or 
another. Whether you're an ed psych specialist

09:45.713 --> 09:54.046
who's looking at some specific little element, 
you ought to be looking at how that can improve

09:45.713 --> 09:54.046
public schools and public education. And I would 
not probably be a popular dean by doing that, But to

09:58.874 --> 10:04.521
me, we've got to focus more on our primary mission, 
and that's improving the schools of Texas. And in

10:05.042 --> 10:06.864
doing so, we improve the private schools. We 
improve, we develop professors that can go into

10:08.025 --> 10:16.416
the other universities with the same mindset that 
public schools are the primary thing. Even though

10:16.436 --> 10:28.611
I might be able to write and do things that are not 
related to improving schools, my primary mission

10:16.436 --> 10:28.611
would be to help schools improve, be proud to be in 
education, make sure that I had an impact on what

10:28.962 --> 10:32.226
happened in the public schools of Texas. What 
role, if any, should this department play in

10:32.807 --> 10:46.164
regard to the homeschool trend and or the small 
privacy? Well, our role, I think, is to encourage

10:46.184 --> 10:56.016
any alternative that will help a child as long as 
it's not violating the Constitution. As long as

10:56.722 --> 11:10.260
these homeschool programs are helping children, 
as long as private schools are helping children,

10:56.722 --> 11:10.260
we should prepare leaders for those, teachers for 
those, and be totally supportive of alternative

10:56.722 --> 11:10.260
programs. Charter schools, more the better as 
long as they really meet the state requirements

11:10.701 --> 11:18.031
and give children alternatives and teachers 
alternatives.

11:21.395 --> 11:22.777
Okay, I hear the end. Do you think of some things we 
haven't touched on? No, you've been very

11:25.780 --> 11:27.902
thorough, very thorough. If we had all the people 
in your A&M years here, to whom would you be

11:30.465 --> 11:40.096
expressing your greatest gratitude and why? 
Yeah. Well, first and foremost would have to be Dr.

11:41.758 --> 11:46.483
Paul Hensarling. He pulled me away from science, 
the National Science Foundation programs,

11:51.582 --> 11:55.747
Somebody told me what a wonderful person he was, 
and I came over and met him for about 30 minutes. I

11:55.787 --> 11:56.628
changed my major. Because he said, John, science 
is fine, but the excitement in the world in your

11:57.870 --> 12:02.395
lifetime is going to be in education. You need to be 
out front and be a part of that. He's the one that's

12:06.360 --> 12:09.644
always told me to be better than you think you can 
be. He's the one that took interest in Carolyn and

12:10.806 --> 12:13.209
the family. He's the one that wrote beautifully 
and contacted superintendents all over the state

12:14.410 --> 12:19.817
when they accomplished something. They knew him. 
He knew more people at that time in my life than

12:20.978 --> 12:24.922
anybody. So he would have to be one. Dr. Bob 
Randall, who came here as a young professor out of

12:26.924 --> 12:34.954
the University of Texas, was just as country as he 
could be, but he was brilliant in measurement. And

12:35.454 --> 12:39.499
he had done some work on problem attack behavior 
and decision making. And I didn't want to do

12:40.059 --> 12:43.483
anything on how to keep your lunch line straight or 
the bus routes in Texas. I wanted social science

12:43.543 --> 12:48.589
because it just was really hot now in 
understanding schools and school leadership.

12:49.244 --> 13:01.778
And he let me come in on his research and dovetailed 
on problem-attack behavior and its relationship

12:49.244 --> 13:01.778
to the sex prior teaching experience and college 
preparation of selected elementary school

12:49.244 --> 13:01.778
principals, a proposal you read a few years ago. 
Very instrumental in getting me into the

13:02.879 --> 13:09.667
behavioral science research end of it and gearing 
me really toward the research side of it. Those two

13:10.128 --> 13:14.052
were very, very important to me. And then I think, 
too, looking back on it, Chuck Sampson. and Marvin

13:19.197 --> 13:23.884
Tate appointing me, you know, to the athletic 
council. Because I was thinking about taking off,

13:26.308 --> 13:36.224
doing a deanship thing and leaving A&M at the time 
and that gave me a place to stay and I'll always

13:26.308 --> 13:36.224
respect Chuck for that. I've had colleagues here 
too that made it livable around here. Bob Stalkup,

13:45.286 --> 13:52.352
who was here, who was in our position as a higher 
education professor, who's now retired up in

13:45.286 --> 13:52.352
Virginia. Dr. David Erlandson, whom I was 
responsible for bringing here as chairing a

13:53.534 --> 13:58.418
search committee after one year here. David is 
very notable, I think. And Brian Cole. Brian, our

14:06.325 --> 14:09.268
department head right now, is the model 
department head. He's going to be involved

14:10.269 --> 14:13.572
halftime with the president on the bonfire thing. 
We've merged departments. He's very much into the

14:16.430 --> 14:20.194
whole continuous improvement quality stuff. But 
he has, where I had a disaster department head

14:21.215 --> 14:27.460
before him. She had never been appointed, but she 
was appointed over the wishes of us. The Stallings

14:33.006 --> 14:39.091
had appointed her, even though the votes were 
strong for another individual who left the

14:33.006 --> 14:39.091
university. When Brian came in, there wasn't any 
of this, I'm going to catch you doing something.

14:44.652 --> 14:48.516
there was this, I'm going to help you succeed and 
encourage you along the way. But it hadn't stopped

14:48.896 --> 14:52.520
him from becoming well-known as well. So I guess in 
terms of the campus itself,

14:53.181 --> 15:04.072
those are the individuals that really stand out. 
Another person that goes way back, who's long dead

15:04.112 --> 15:08.497
now, John Millef. When I was an undergraduate 
here, He told me when I was running around hell

15:12.580 --> 15:19.127
raising, thinking about good bull stories that 
later emerged. I remember one time I got to know him

15:19.147 --> 15:21.189
through a friend of mine. I wasn't in veterinary 
medicine. I remember he told me when I was

15:24.033 --> 15:27.937
struggling trying to make grades to stay in 
school. He says, John Hoyle, you've got what it

15:27.957 --> 15:31.901
takes to graduate from Texas A&M. At the time, I 
didn't believe him. At the end of the four years, I

15:37.507 --> 15:41.231
walked down the steps. There he was. I didn't even, 
I never had him as a prof. 1967, Ph.D., he was at the

15:42.331 --> 15:48.220
bottom of the stairs. He and John and Ruth Milliff 
were key players along those years, even though I

15:48.981 --> 15:53.808
never had them. They were great mentors, great 
people. And I went to see them in their failing

15:56.251 --> 16:01.899
years, and I'll always respect that. What was his 
nickname? It was Dr. Milliff to me. Is that right?

16:08.929 --> 16:09.350
Yeah. I'm trying to remember. He was an icon. I was 
just a little old nobody. In all these years, the

16:15.063 --> 16:25.137
best moments, the joyful moments, what were some 
of

16:15.063 --> 16:25.137
those? I think probably graduation day in 1957, 
mother and dad here, being the first boy with an

16:25.157 --> 16:31.586
official degree. My sister was here and Carolyn. 
We were married soon after that. joyous moment.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.687
Finished the PhD was a joyous moment. They were 
here and dad gave me a little briefcase I remember.

16:47.577 --> 16:56.890
Professionally, of course, personally, in terms 
of my children, all those kinds of things and

16:47.577 --> 16:56.890
graduating, seeing them succeed, been very 
joyous. And then last, last summer, being

16:56.910 --> 17:05.022
selected by my colleagues around the nation for 
the first Living Legend Award in our field. And

17:08.134 --> 17:13.702
what an honor that was, not deserving, but one that 
really was a joyous time. And there were people far

17:15.304 --> 17:19.069
more scholarly, but somehow I lucked out and got 
it. And we made it even more meaningful this year

17:19.569 --> 17:28.341
when Jack Culbertson got it, who had created UCEA 
and really been the father of our field the last 40

17:19.569 --> 17:28.341
years. But those were joyous kinds of moments. And 
I've gotten a couple of Distinguished Teaching

17:31.305 --> 17:34.789
Awards here. that, you know, it's a great feeling, 
but there's also others who deserved it that don't

17:35.107 --> 17:57.500
get it because, I'm not saying it's political, but 
it's such a timing thing sometimes, and anybody

17:35.107 --> 17:57.500
who gets one of them deserves it, but there's so 
many others who do, so I'm not sure it's a peer type

17:35.107 --> 17:57.500
of thing, you know what I mean? It's a great award, 
and I'm glad I got them, but the other things

17:58.341 --> 18:03.088
brought me more joy. Let's make believe a stranger 
walks up to you and hands you a check for a million

18:04.030 --> 18:11.640
dollars with one condition. You must pass it on to 
Texas A&M, but you've got to decide how they spend

18:11.660 --> 18:15.685
the money. What would you ask them to do if you could 
give them a million dollars? Yeah. If I could give

18:21.011 --> 18:29.582
them a million dollars, I would obviously say that 
school leadership is where I want it to be. I want to

18:30.811 --> 18:33.474
be placed on school leadership. And I want to go in 
and identify even at the high school level. Excuse

18:41.584 --> 18:42.145
me. I would say let's identify some of your 
outstanding young men and women in your high

18:44.268 --> 18:53.579
school who have some aspirations for education. 
And I would like to see that money spent on

18:54.801 --> 18:57.544
scholarships, and to have a nurturing 
environment when they enter the university, to

18:57.912 --> 19:07.463
have them come all the way at four-year program 
into education with their idea on being

18:57.912 --> 19:07.463
principals or superintendents. And that's, to 
me, that's where I wanted to go. Last question.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.513
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas 
A&M today? I

19:19.177 --> 19:25.624
love the institution dearly.

19:28.507 --> 19:35.155
I'm glad I made the decision to get my doctorate 
here, even though I was at Colorado University.

19:40.822 --> 19:51.014
The only concern I have about Texas A&M, it's still 
overwhelmingly traditional and conservative.

19:52.355 --> 19:58.142
And where I'm a moderate, I sometimes clash with 
some of the I

19:58.831 --> 20:16.969
guess I would never, never tell a student not to 
become a tech student. If they're interested, I'm

20:16.989 --> 20:21.293
going to tell them this is the place to come. We've 
got outstanding faculty here. We've had under Dr.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.960
Bowen, I think we've had a good stable leadership 
And the 2020 vision project, if Dr. Bowen and his

20:28.683 --> 20:36.814
staff can sell that and make that work, that can 
really be a great opportunity. But right now, I

20:36.834 --> 20:40.979
don't see it grabbing hold. You know, the dreams 
are there, but I don't see the action. I see the

20:43.743 --> 20:48.008
faculty standing back and saying, well, this too 
shall pass. I'd like to see it implemented and see

20:48.088 --> 20:50.792
it happen.
