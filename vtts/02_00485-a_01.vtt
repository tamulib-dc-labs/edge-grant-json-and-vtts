This is September 29, 1981. This is Terry 
Anderson. This is an interview with General

00:06.328 --> 00:11.433
Ludeke in College Station, testing.

00:14.516 --> 00:15.897
Let's start in now. This is an interview with Major 
General Ludeke. Today is the 29th of September,

00:19.121 --> 00:22.804
1981. Let's start with your early life. You were 
born the 1st of October, 1910, in El Dorado, Texas.

00:31.064 --> 00:34.949
And could you, let's start by talking about your 
parents. Could you tell me about your heritage,

00:34.969 --> 00:38.633
your background, where your parents came from? My

00:38.653 --> 00:56.093
father's father, my grandfather,

00:38.653 --> 00:56.093
was born in New Orleans off parents who had 
immigrated from Germany.

00:56.114 --> 00:58.236
And he married a girl whose parents had immigrated 
at approximately the same time from

00:59.920 --> 01:06.888
Czechoslovakia. And they came to

01:08.730 --> 01:28.493
by way of

01:08.730 --> 01:28.493
several places that I'm not familiar with in New 
Orleans and ended up in East Texas at Lockhart. And

01:29.975 --> 01:34.821
it was there that my father was born. And he moved 
when he was approximately 14 out to Stanford,

01:34.841 --> 01:47.377
Texas, and when he was approximately 17 down to El 
Dorado.

01:50.982 --> 01:58.311
And it was there that he married my mother, Lizzie 
Octavia Smith. whose

01:59.506 --> 02:12.525
father and mother came to Texas from Tennessee and 
settled mainly in Coke County. My mother and

02:14.428 --> 02:24.282
father met in San Angelo, or near San Angelo, and 
were married in El Dorado in 1909. And then I was

02:25.730 --> 02:31.379
born five miles from El Dorado in 1910.

02:33.542 --> 02:34.984
Could you tell me about their education? Their 
education was limited to the sixth and seventh

02:36.887 --> 02:53.914
grades and they had no further formal education 
than that. What did your father do? What type of

02:55.957 --> 02:57.078
occupation? My father was a stockman farmer. He 
would have loved to have been a big rancher, except

03:02.363 --> 03:09.170
he didn't have the resources to become one. And so 
he had to satisfy himself by participating in

03:10.491 --> 03:24.424
ranching with other people and by operating a 
stock farm. So in addition to peripheral type of

03:25.687 --> 03:45.417
ranching, we raised cotton feed and worked the 
farm

03:25.687 --> 03:45.417
as farms were operated in those days with no 
machinery. So the principal staple crop was

03:47.460 --> 03:51.947
cotton, although we raised Cattle, horses, 
mules, hogs, other things that it took to provide

03:53.108 --> 04:09.088
food and try to provide enough money to keep the 
family together. And how many were in the family? I

04:11.110 --> 04:12.612
was the oldest of eight. No kidding, eight? Eight, 
the youngest having been born while I was a

04:14.855 --> 04:18.960
freshman here at A&M. No kidding. That's quite a 
spread of about 20 years. Yes it is. All of those

04:27.233 --> 04:39.771
except one are still in fine shape and living and 
have their own families and going about their own

04:27.233 --> 04:39.771
business. When you say he was a stockman farmer, 
what exactly does that mean? Was he a tenant farmer

04:43.456 --> 04:44.958
then? Well, he was a tenant part of the time, 
although most of my life he owned his own place.

04:52.591 --> 05:04.830
When I say stockman farmer, I mean by that that you 
have a place where you have a farm and you have the

04:52.591 --> 05:04.830
stock necessary to work the farmers, horses, 
mules, and so forth. And you have some cattle,

05:05.620 --> 05:14.731
sheep, or other animals that you're raising, 
trying to make money by having. Like a stock farm,

05:16.833 --> 05:26.064
you could, I don't associate a stock farm with 
selling farm products. I associate that with

05:26.885 --> 05:29.468
selling stock. that you have kept by the products 
from the farm, the feed and things of this nature.

05:39.408 --> 05:40.769
So this was both. He raised feed for livestock and 
fed livestock and sold the livestock, but he also

05:40.789 --> 05:51.762
raised cotton and wheat and other products that 
were sold directly as such. And how many acres did

05:51.782 --> 05:53.864
he have? Well, it varied from...

05:59.553 --> 06:04.959
640 square miles

05:59.553 --> 06:04.959
down to as low as 240. The

06:04.999 --> 06:13.008
last place that he owned of his own was 240 acres. 
And did he use tenant farmers, too, for the cotton?

06:20.997 --> 06:22.638
No, he did his own. He did his own what? He and I and 
the rest of the kids We all worked on the farm. So he

06:32.602 --> 06:34.925
didn't use either tenants nor migrants? No. Well, 
in the earlier days, for picking cotton, he used

06:36.147 --> 06:40.893
migrants. Pickers, all right. But other than 
that, no, he didn't use them.

06:47.582 --> 06:54.072
Later, of course, machines took the place of even 
cotton pickers. But he used them during the time,

06:54.092 --> 06:59.479
at least, that I was involved. What kind of person 
was he? Can you tell me about his character? Yes, I

07:03.859 --> 07:07.905
certainly can. My dad was, of course, a wonderful 
man like other people's dads. He was quite young as

07:13.854 --> 07:28.015
compared

07:13.854 --> 07:28.015
to me as a father, because he was not quite 19 when I 
was born. And

07:29.294 --> 07:35.602
so in a sense, I grew up with him. But he was a rather 
large man, 5'10", 180 or 190 pounds. A very

07:45.235 --> 07:47.438
physically strong man. And also, in a stubborn 
German way, a very strong-minded.

07:56.029 --> 07:56.710
Strong-willed? A strong-willed man. And

07:58.758 --> 08:26.328
so as a kid growing up and trying to

07:58.758 --> 08:26.328
learn how to live in the world, I had some problems 
living with him because he was very much a

07:58.758 --> 08:26.328
perfectionist with German stubbornness, and he 
expected out of me a

07:58.758 --> 08:26.328
great deal. And I tried real hard to to make it. I'm 
not sure whether I finally did or not. Was he an

08:34.403 --> 08:35.925
authoritarian type? I'm sorry? Authoritarian? 
Was he very authoritarian? Yes, quite. And stern?

08:42.254 --> 08:44.837
Very, yes. I don't mean by that that he was a crank or 
anything. He was a lot of fun and enjoyed it and

08:48.122 --> 08:57.334
enjoyed participating in all kinds of fun things. 
But he was very, very stern and worked to establish

08:58.698 --> 09:10.294
principles that were fully enunciated. There 
wasn't any question about it. He expected to, and

09:13.598 --> 09:16.782
did, live by them. He expected his family to live by 
them. He expected other people that he associated

09:19.366 --> 09:23.912
with to live by them, otherwise he didn't 
associate with them. Now, was he the authority in

09:24.618 --> 09:27.942
the family or in the household, or was your mother? 
He was. Well, I have to moderate that a bit. They

09:32.628 --> 09:37.994
were in their respective areas, but overall there 
was no question about that. No. Can you tell me

09:40.137 --> 09:41.138
about your mother? Yes.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.766
My mother was a wonderful person. She was the 
youngest of five children in her father's first

09:54.402 --> 10:10.705
family, but he was married again and had seven more 
children, so she was really one of twelve

09:54.402 --> 10:10.705
children. And really in the middle, because she 
was the last of the first group and was raised by her

10:20.356 --> 10:22.218
older sister. There was no mother at that time. And 
they were a very poor family and poor in an economic

10:26.763 --> 10:32.849
sense. And her father was very much of an 
entrepreneur, very

10:35.472 --> 10:46.063
jack of all trades and not particularly good at any 
of them. And he hauled his family around over West

10:46.083 --> 10:49.266
Texas. and in one way or another established three 
or four towns.

11:00.156 --> 11:10.815
There may be some question in other people's minds 
about whether they established them or not, but

11:00.156 --> 11:10.815
Pontotoc and Kickapoo and

11:13.040 --> 11:15.883
Caffer, I think, certainly established those.

11:18.986 --> 11:28.676
He usually would find a way to be the postmaster, 
and run a store, and maybe build a church. So he

11:28.696 --> 11:35.242
worked on in that way. And the last place he lived 
was the town he established. Town, unquote. just

11:43.938 --> 11:48.923
west of El Dorado, between El Dorado and Ozona, 
called Caffer. And he lived there until he died at

11:51.186 --> 12:00.296
about 86 or something about like that. The

12:00.316 --> 12:08.024
mother didn't get the education that she wanted to 
get. There was no way to do it. And when she married

12:11.309 --> 12:14.072
dad, she was 19. And so thereafter, of course, she 
led the same life that he did and the one I just

12:15.233 --> 12:21.060
talked about. But she was a very compassionate 
woman, a very

12:23.843 --> 12:39.460
great amount of common sense. and understanding 
of human nature. And in the situation she was in,

12:46.248 --> 12:49.051
she needed it all.

12:52.855 --> 13:00.722
With that many children and those kind of economic 
straits, why, it wasn't an easy life. Was religion

13:01.784 --> 13:04.246
important in your family? Yes, religion was 
important, although we didn't attend church

13:09.798 --> 13:17.610
regularly and didn't

13:09.798 --> 13:17.610
make too much of a fuss about it. We lived

13:20.455 --> 13:30.591
pretty carefully under the religious 
principles, and we actually were members of the

13:20.455 --> 13:30.591
Baptist church. and attended when we could. Most 
of the children were baptized in that. Some of them

13:40.055 --> 13:41.997
went to other churches later on.

13:46.563 --> 14:00.358
But we were very religious in what I think is a true 
religious sense in accepting

13:46.563 --> 14:00.358
the principles and the teachings of the Bible and 
following them. We didn't make a lot of public fuss

14:01.317 --> 14:13.272
about the thing or become big pillars in the church 
at the time. Economically we couldn't afford it,

14:13.372 --> 14:18.879
among other things, but it wasn't their nature 
anyway. I was wondering if your father ever took a

14:20.040 --> 14:25.587
position of leadership in the community. He did in 
the ways that he could. He

14:30.821 --> 14:49.300
was a member of the school board two or three times, 
two or three different school boards that we used

14:30.821 --> 14:49.300
when we had small

14:30.821 --> 14:49.300
school districts. And later the county, when it 
was all converted to county, he was there.

14:57.967 --> 15:08.664
He helped the sheriff a number of times, on special 
occasions as deputy, or when there was need, not as

14:57.967 --> 15:08.664
an occupation.

15:12.089 --> 15:20.042
And he was very active in all the elections, and 
local, not national. as anybody else, I guess, in

15:21.946 --> 15:31.539
the National, but I mean, his work was mostly for 
local county offices. He never ran for election

15:31.559 --> 15:33.121
himself? Oh, he ran one time for sheriff, and was 
defeated. But that was quite late in

15:42.374 --> 15:50.485
his life. But other than that one time he never did 
know him and he never held public office. How did

15:58.058 --> 15:59.861
you get along with all your brothers and sisters? 
Fine.

16:05.408 --> 16:12.057
They considered it more how did they get along with 
me because I was the oldest.

16:17.805 --> 16:20.809
Very, very well indeed. living the kind of life we 
did, why it was necessary that I look after them,

16:21.515 --> 16:33.507
physically look after them. We had to ride 
horseback to school five miles from back every

16:33.527 --> 16:40.353
day, for example, and the two just younger than I am 
are girls. And

16:41.634 --> 16:48.501
at the time my brother, who was still younger than 
that, was big enough take on those kind of jobs, why

16:49.460 --> 16:55.089
the situation was different and I was gone. So I had 
a great deal of, had to accept a great deal of

16:55.329 --> 17:01.859
responsibility for them, which I did. And

17:01.899 --> 17:12.615
they understood it, appreciated it, and it's been 
that way, so we've had no problem. You've had a very

17:13.085 --> 17:17.052
successful career, rising to major general. I was 
wondering in what way do you think that your

17:17.072 --> 17:20.197
parents are responsible for that? My parents are, 
as far as I'm concerned, directly responsible for

17:21.459 --> 17:28.191
it in several ways. One of those was

17:30.855 --> 17:38.468
their convictions and the strength of their 
convictions. They felt if something was right,

17:40.456 --> 17:46.502
they didn't have to have anything else to 
recommend it. That was enough by itself.

17:52.008 --> 17:59.956
They also felt that if you really wanted to do 
something that was right, and you wanted to do it

17:52.008 --> 17:59.956
good enough, you could find a way to do it.

18:05.782 --> 18:09.045
And yet they were not disposed to a reckless 
approach to that end, and certainly not to a

18:10.949 --> 18:19.063
dishonest one to that end.

18:24.913 --> 18:33.447
They also felt that of anything, I think when I was a 
kid it was probably most important to me that they

18:34.827 --> 18:50.174
taught that any time I had an opportunity to learn 
something that I didn't know, it was worth

18:34.827 --> 18:50.174
learning, whether I thought I needed it or not, or 
whether I thought I would ever use it or not. And I

18:52.598 --> 18:53.319
followed that. Sometimes it wasn't too easy. And I 
swear, in retrospect, I don't think I ever learned

18:56.090 --> 19:11.725
anything that some way I didn't use in a very 
relatively short time after that, and was tickled

18:56.090 --> 19:11.725
to death that I knew it. So I think that was an 
important thing. But mainly it was the knowledge

19:16.470 --> 19:25.118
of their desire that we do well and do it right. that 
provided the motivation and the drive and the

19:25.233 --> 19:31.480
stickability to get something done. Both of them. 
Let's move to your education. Can you tell me about

19:38.908 --> 19:42.953
your early education? Early education, I guess 
first grade is the earliest that I went to a little

19:42.993 --> 19:54.025
school in Slacker County called Bailey Ranch. And 
it was a little school with one teacher. There were

20:01.743 --> 20:06.671
eleven or twelve, I've forgotten which, students 
or kids. And they ranged from the first grade to the

20:08.533 --> 20:11.618
tenth grade. In my class in the first grade there 
was one other boy, one other student who was a boy.

20:26.759 --> 20:39.354
And I don't know how that teacher did it, but she 
kept us quite busy from the time we got to school

20:26.759 --> 20:39.354
until we left to go home, and still taught ten other 
classes in the same room, all in the same room. And

20:40.876 --> 20:46.603
we didn't find any time on our hands or any boredom 
or anything else. We were busy and working and

20:46.663 --> 20:48.565
learning. And I think we learned as much as first 
graders anywhere else did, at least we certainly

20:50.047 --> 20:55.893
held our own after that. Well, I went to that school 
for two years, and in the meantime they had built

20:57.074 --> 21:13.251
another school, same group, same district, same 
purpose, but it was a bigger, nicer school with

20:57.074 --> 21:13.251
better facilities. And so I went to that one a year 
and a half, and then we moved so that I went to the

21:13.271 --> 21:19.918
school in town, in El Dorado. for the rest of my 
grade school and high school education, which

21:21.265 --> 21:30.300
would have been the fifth on through the eleventh. 
Until you graduated in 1928. Now what were your

21:31.903 --> 21:35.409
favorite subjects while you were in school?

21:38.654 --> 21:44.404
Well, I guess if I have to...

21:44.823 --> 21:46.786
categorize them that way. I would have to say that 
history was my favorite subject. I got the problem

21:51.912 --> 22:08.934
though because I couldn't find any way when I was 
about the ninth or tenth grade that I could ever

21:51.912 --> 22:08.934
make a living making a difference how much I know 
about history in that particular country. That is

22:09.034 --> 22:11.117
a problem. I'd better concentrate a little more on 
things other than history.

22:19.699 --> 22:30.790
So I felt real comfortable with mathematics and 
science projects, and so I took all of those in high

22:19.699 --> 22:30.790
school that I could. And when I came to A&M, I took 
chemical engineering. What type of student were

22:40.120 --> 22:41.121
you? In high school? Well,

22:43.451 --> 22:59.547
I was about

22:43.451 --> 22:59.547
varied from

22:43.451 --> 22:59.547
one to four in the class, I guess, at the top of the 
class. So you were a hard worker? Well, yes, I was

23:03.090 --> 23:10.838
pretty hard, but that period of time, those four 
years that I was in high was also a very, very

23:11.864 --> 23:19.100
difficult period for us economically as a family. 
A

23:19.120 --> 23:28.962
lot of times I'd get home from school by hurrying 
around 4 or 4.30 I'd go down and relieve Dad on the

23:30.342 --> 23:36.670
tractor in the field and plow until 11 or 12 
o'clock. He'd come back and take over for me and I'd

23:37.631 --> 23:41.976
go home and do my studying after that. And a good 
many times I'd run that right on up until it was time

23:43.678 --> 23:51.608
to go back to school and just go back to school. That 
wasn't an everyday occurrence, but it was

23:52.972 --> 24:02.020
certainly more than every week for quite a while. 
And it kept my grades from being quite as good, I

24:02.821 --> 24:08.326
think, as they would have been. On the other hand, 
it sure as hell kept me out of trouble, too. You

24:11.429 --> 24:15.853
didn't have time for any sports or activities, or 
did you? Some, but not very many. I mean, not in the

24:17.315 --> 24:22.860
sense that kids think of it now at all, not anything 
like that. So you didn't have an opportunity to be

24:23.110 --> 24:28.157
in any groups or clubs or organizations? Not in 
high school. I played basketball.

24:35.266 --> 24:38.750
I don't remember that there were any clubs at that 
time. Most other kids were in the same boat that I

24:39.491 --> 24:41.634
was. Did you consider yourself well liked or 
popular in high school? In school you mean? Yes.

24:49.705 --> 24:58.853
Not to set the world on fire or anything, but I think 
people didn't dislike me. They admired some of my

24:58.973 --> 25:05.739
qualities, and when they were in trouble, they 
looked to me to help them out.

25:09.263 --> 25:15.508
So,

25:09.263 --> 25:15.508
I wasn't the high school hero or anything like 
that. When you graduated from high school, Did you

25:19.017 --> 25:25.947
have firm ideas of what you wanted to do, or were you 
still sort of up in the air, or what did you think?

25:26.428 --> 25:33.117
Well, if you had asked me then, I would have said I 
had firm ideas of what I wanted to do. But I don't

25:33.137 --> 25:43.692
honestly think, in retrospect, that anybody at 
that age and in that circumstances really knows as

25:33.137 --> 25:43.692
much as he thinks he knows about what he wants to do. 
On the other hand, I feel it's good that they feel

25:45.123 --> 25:48.648
that way. At least they're getting started doing 
something. It doesn't leave you in this category

25:51.332 --> 26:02.608
of, I've heard a lot about recently, of having to go 
find yourself, which is about as ridiculous as

25:51.332 --> 26:02.608
anything I can think of, offhand. So I thought, 
yes, I came down here to A&M for a short course in the

26:04.711 --> 26:14.826
summer.

26:15.329 --> 26:21.035
used that as a means of checking into the school and 
what it did. They were offering this new course in

26:22.136 --> 26:30.243
chemical engineering and everybody said that was 
the hardest course they had in this place. So I

26:32.706 --> 26:45.218
thought that's what I'd like to try because the oil 
companies were just really getting to the point

26:32.706 --> 26:45.218
where they were needing that kind of help. You

26:46.210 --> 26:51.337
could get a job if it got through. So when you 
graduated from high school, then you had made up

26:51.978 --> 26:56.624
your mind that you wanted to be an engineer. Yes. 
Now, when you thought about being an engineer, did

26:58.868 --> 27:04.495
you think of any other school besides A&M? Yes, I 
thought of several,

27:06.438 --> 27:12.927
particularly Texas University.

27:15.792 --> 27:31.422
But after I came down here in the summer, between 
the time I graduated, I didn't try to think about

27:15.792 --> 27:31.422
anything else then, because I didn't think there 
were any that held a candle to it. I think we have to

27:31.942 --> 27:44.020
remember that at that time, your knowledge of what 
this university did or that university did was

27:31.942 --> 27:44.020
very much limited by comparison to what it is now. 
The

27:44.381 --> 27:58.843
school might enjoy a fine reputation in this or 
that, but there would be a certainly limited

27:44.381 --> 27:58.843
number of people who knew that.

27:59.600 --> 28:04.164
somewhere in West Texas where there wasn't much 
communication. And if we remember, radio had only

28:05.245 --> 28:14.993
been available to homes a matter of five or six 
years before that. It was fine to people that

28:15.013 --> 28:17.776
didn't know very much about it. So one had to go and

28:17.836 --> 28:28.645
look up the facts himself, if you could find them, 
make up your own mind about it. And that's what the

28:29.857 --> 28:33.021
trip down here did for me. Now, the fact that A&M was 
a military institution, did that have any bearing

28:33.461 --> 28:38.988
whatsoever on going to that school? Well, I wasn't 
particularly anxious to be military at that

28:39.969 --> 28:47.919
point. Had you ever had any contact with the 
military before? No. No, not at all. Well, I had an

28:57.059 --> 29:04.316
uncle who fought in World War II, and I heard all his 
stories and whatnot, but other than that, no.

29:04.336 --> 29:06.340
World War I. I'm sorry, World War I, yeah. But other 
than that, I hadn't. And I didn't have any wild

29:09.407 --> 29:12.013
desire about it. So you never thought about 
getting an engineering degree at West Point or a

29:12.213 --> 29:16.917
service academy? No, not at that time, no. But to 
come to NL, well, of course, you couldn't come here

29:21.542 --> 29:25.605
without being in the Corps. Sure, right. But even 
if you could, I wouldn't have done it because I

29:26.426 --> 29:34.473
couldn't see anybody passing up a wonderful 
opportunity like that. So I would have been in the

29:36.295 --> 29:39.418
Corps in any case. So you arrived in the summer of 
1928? Yeah, September. Well, you took a short

29:48.040 --> 29:49.942
course first in the summer. Well, that was only, 
that's a farmer's thing. That's three days, I

29:54.089 --> 29:55.851
think. Oh, I see. I don't consider, that just 
afforded me an opportunity to be here and to check

29:56.192 --> 30:01.459
into some things. One of the things that afforded 
me the opportunity to do was contact a couple of

30:02.401 --> 30:06.807
people who were here who could give me a job if I came 
down here. And I did contact them, and they

30:14.231 --> 30:18.717
indicated that maybe they could. They didn't have 
anything right. They couldn't say absolutely

30:21.300 --> 30:23.903
they will, but they would try. Well, of course, 
that brings me to the next question. Your family

30:27.929 --> 30:30.051
was basically poor. How could you afford to go to 
college? I borrowed from my uncle. and who also

30:37.111 --> 30:44.760
lived there in El Dorado, and who was sheriff there 
for sixteen years. And he was a bachelor, didn't

30:46.983 --> 30:50.887
have sons of his own. So he loaned me some money and 
gave me some money. It went along, and then when I

30:57.055 --> 31:00.419
got here, I worked for them. My senior year, when I 
was here, I was my jobs were good enough that I was

31:06.406 --> 31:12.956
able to go to school and more than make my way. And 
then in the years following school I paid back the

31:15.019 --> 31:24.233
money that I had borrowed earlier. Now what type of 
jobs did you have while you were there? Well I was

31:28.499 --> 31:32.565
here, well the first year

31:35.347 --> 31:46.622
I mostly worked with the building grounds people, 
which translates into pushing a real-type lawn

31:35.347 --> 31:46.622
mower for 25 cents an hour. I

31:46.642 --> 31:55.854
did some work in the power plant. Most of that 
translates to shoveling coal, but there was some

31:55.874 --> 32:03.244
other work in there, and most of that late at night. 
during my freshman year, and of course I didn't get

32:04.287 --> 32:10.997
rich doing that either. I had worked a little bit in 
the student post office and a little bit in the

32:11.017 --> 32:27.020
faculty post office, just when they needed extra 
help in both cases, and a little bit in the fiscal

32:11.017 --> 32:27.020
department during my freshman year. Again, that 
odd time not to study things. So when I came back as a

32:32.671 --> 32:50.034
sophomore, I got that job in the fiscal 
department,

32:32.671 --> 32:50.034
which started I think at seven o'clock in the 
evening, and I usually get through by 9.30 or 10,

32:32.671 --> 32:50.034
sometimes 11. So I had two to three hours of work in 
the fiscal department. And I got more work in the

32:57.916 --> 33:03.422
student post office, about half time in there 
then. And then the next year, while both of these

33:05.744 --> 33:15.754
jobs were increasing, I was the student 
postmaster and handled the whole thing for the

33:05.744 --> 33:15.754
last two years. So by that time you were in a fairly 
decent financial situation? Doing reasonably

33:20.219 --> 33:21.720
well, of course. The people looking at the money 
that you get No.

33:32.173 --> 33:42.525
You said before that your dad ran for sheriff and he 
was a little bit interested

33:32.173 --> 33:42.525
in politics. He was a Democrat like everybody was 
in Texas at the time. Yeah, he was a Democrat. Let's

33:47.451 --> 33:51.075
talk a little bit about his and then philosophy or 
political philosophy? Were you moderates,

33:54.130 --> 33:56.993
liberals, conservatives? What did you consider 
yourself? I think we have to temper

34:00.457 --> 34:13.172
almost anything with a recognition of the 
communication situation back in those days. I

34:14.213 --> 34:21.602
think one could say liberal or conservative

34:14.213 --> 34:21.602
and it really wouldn't

34:25.463 --> 34:32.552
measure

34:25.463 --> 34:32.552
one's philosophy then.

34:36.978 --> 34:39.482
My dad was just a straight Democrat. He had no room 
for the Republicans or anybody else for that

34:41.965 --> 34:52.860
matter. But the issues were so different. I don't 
know what he would be if he were alive today. Well,

35:01.655 --> 35:03.177
what did he feel about prohibition? He thought 
that it would be a good idea if he could make it, as a

35:05.320 --> 35:13.872
practical matter, make it go, but he didn't think 
he could. And so he was against it. I mean, he was for

35:17.898 --> 35:24.327
leaving things alone, not for the amendment. What 
did you think about Franklin Roosevelt and the New

35:24.796 --> 35:29.781
Deal? Well, at that time I was gone, and since that 
was the height of the Depression I was kind of busy,

35:29.801 --> 35:37.128
I'll tell you for sure. So, I really don't know. I

35:40.851 --> 35:45.075
just don't know. He was very bitter about Hoover, 
but I don't know whether that was just because

35:46.216 --> 35:52.542
Hoover was a Republican or because he really had a 
different kind of judgment on the economic

35:52.927 --> 35:56.831
situation. Did your father ever, do you know, even 
though you were gone, did your father ever

35:56.851 --> 36:02.917
accepted any government aid during the New Deal? 
No, absolutely not. He didn't go for that talk, not

36:06.360 --> 36:11.005
any, in any form. He considered accepting aid as a 
damned insult to his capabilities to make a living

36:11.025 --> 36:18.732
for himself and his family. He wouldn't have 
accepted one if he had been starving to death. Now,

36:25.492 --> 36:28.457
what about your political philosophy? Well, I 
grew up there as a Democrat. As a matter of fact,

36:32.523 --> 36:44.720
when you mentioned that, I was thinking about a 
time

36:32.523 --> 36:44.720
when I was a little kid when there was a Republican 
president elected, and I've forgotten which one

36:32.523 --> 36:44.720
right now. But he threw out the postmaster. who was 
a Democrat, and appointed a new postmaster, whom I

36:50.690 --> 36:57.197
heard my dad say was a goddamn Republican.

36:59.780 --> 37:06.787
And he was talking to a neighbor about this damn 
Republican up there as a postmaster.

37:06.807 --> 37:15.617
So we were going to go to town in a few days, and I went 
with him once to the post office, because I wanted

37:06.807 --> 37:15.617
to see this, this Republican.

37:19.478 --> 37:27.687
So we, I went to the post office with my father, and 
he knew the man of course, I didn't.

37:27.707 --> 37:37.898
And he spoke to him, called him Stratkins, and we 
talked for quite a little while there, and we got

37:27.707 --> 37:37.898
out of the post office, I said, so I think he was a 
pretty nice man. Dad said, well he's a fine man if he

37:40.200 --> 37:43.063
just wasn't a damn Republican. But I had never seen 
one, I don't know what the hell a Republican looked

37:44.705 --> 37:49.350
like, you see. I was very surprised that they were 
human and everything was fine.

37:57.498 --> 38:08.082
I continued to be a Democrat on up until 10 or 12 
years ago.

38:09.327 --> 38:10.949
And now you're a Republican? Yes. When they come 
out with the likes of McGovern as a candidate for

38:11.911 --> 38:20.322
president of the United States, I can't stomach 
that in any sense. And what did you think about

38:20.563 --> 38:25.910
Lyndon Johnson as far as his programs? Well, about 
his program,

38:26.271 --> 38:34.282
I don't, I didn't like it. I knew Lyndon Johnson 
pretty well. Had a good many occasions to do

38:41.805 --> 38:49.877
business with him, government business.

38:49.897 --> 38:52.501
And I have to admire a great many things about him. 
But there's some things that I don't admire about

38:54.344 --> 38:58.129
him, didn't admire about him.

39:03.597 --> 39:08.224
I think he understood an awful lot better what made 
Lyndon Johnson move than he did what made the

39:09.453 --> 39:15.619
United States move on a long-term basis. I think 
things that were important to Lyndon Johnson were

39:15.639 --> 39:31.674
a little more important to him sometimes than the 
good of his country, and I don't admire that on

39:15.639 --> 39:31.674
anybody, no matter how expedient it might be for 
the problem at hand. In other words, ever since

39:32.295 --> 39:37.059
McGovern in 1972, you voted, you've been a 
Republican. You betcha. And are you a member of the

39:39.237 --> 39:41.720
Republican Party? Did you ever get active in 
politics? Oh, yes. I'm a member of the Republican

39:44.243 --> 39:50.269
National Committee.

39:50.289 --> 40:05.987
I haven't been active in local politics,

39:50.289 --> 40:05.987
but reasonably active in national politics.

40:08.178 --> 40:26.258
that actually split ticket

40:08.178 --> 40:26.258
in a local sense,

40:08.178 --> 40:26.258
because the Republicans haven't put up the best 
candidates in some of these places. And when I can

40:26.278 --> 40:36.649
have a guy like Tiger Teague, who's a classmate of 
mine, and I suppose everybody knows what he did and

40:26.278 --> 40:36.649
what he stood for, Well, I'm going to arrange it so 
that I can vote for him. I guess never anybody. OK.

40:44.388 --> 40:45.910
Let's go back to A&M, then. Can you tell me, we 
talked about your employment there. Can you tell

40:49.335 --> 40:52.600
me about where you lived on campus for your four 
years? How were the accommodations?

40:59.350 --> 41:08.543
Well, I think in general, one would say that what we 
thought were very good accommodations then would

40:59.350 --> 41:08.543
be absolutely unacceptable. to the kids now, and I 
can't tell you whether this is good or bad, but I

41:09.299 --> 41:18.034
have my own notion about it.

41:19.557 --> 41:33.822
When I entered school and entered the Corps, I was 
assigned a D Battery or Field Artillery, which was

41:19.557 --> 41:33.822
the newest unit organized that year.

41:36.535 --> 41:46.770
And that battery was quartered in Foster Hall.

41:46.790 --> 41:56.844
So I spent that year, freshman year, and sophomore 
year in Foster Hall. And then the junior year, we

41:56.864 --> 42:06.137
moved over and were in Puryear Hall, which was 
brand new, just opened that year. and also a senior

42:08.075 --> 42:10.198
year. I was in first year hall. So the 
accommodations were pretty good for the time.

42:15.325 --> 42:18.770
They were wonderful as far as I'm concerned for the 
time. At that time there still were Hollywood, the

42:18.830 --> 42:34.572
huts and all of that, and I had a lot of friends that 
lived in them, spent a lot of time down there, and

42:18.830 --> 42:34.572
they weren't too bad either. didn't like very 
much, but they were all right. What was your

42:39.045 --> 42:40.267
opinion of hazing? Well, I thought it was 
wonderful actually. I realize

42:43.992 --> 42:58.332
how it sounds to say that,

42:43.992 --> 42:58.332
but I think it made people out of an awful lot of of 
individuals who might not otherwise have

42:59.628 --> 43:07.199
achieved that status. Well, what do you mean by 
that? Could you continue? I mean, I think it made

43:11.505 --> 43:23.762
for

43:11.505 --> 43:23.762
a deeper understanding of many kinds of values, 
including human values.

43:28.889 --> 43:52.924
And it created an understanding of discipline, 
not just discipline in a military sense, but

43:28.889 --> 43:52.924
discipline of thinking and discipline of conduct 
that

43:28.889 --> 43:52.924
kids growing up don't have automatically and now 
in most cases don't get. And I think it was good in

43:54.266 --> 43:58.592
that sense.

44:01.289 --> 44:04.413
It's true, I'm sure, that it can be abused. It was 
abused and has been since. But I'm also quite

44:09.799 --> 44:20.591
convinced that it isn't abused one-fifth as much 
as people would have you believe it was abused.

44:20.611 --> 44:29.001
Because the

44:20.611 --> 44:29.001
thing was handled in such way within the Corps when 
I was going up in it that if somebody, someone

44:31.411 --> 44:42.250
abused it very much, they were called on the carpet 
too, and they didn't get by with it. Little fringe

44:42.270 --> 44:47.239
areas, yeah, but I don't think they ever hurt 
anybody. How far could it go? Obviously it has to be

44:50.785 --> 44:52.949
some limits on it. Sure.

44:58.192 --> 45:03.941
Obviously also it had gone a little too far 
sometimes.

45:03.961 --> 45:08.367
I guess it was at about its height when I was here. I 
don't mean because I was here, but in looking at the

45:09.108 --> 45:18.502
situation it looked like it kind of peaked right 
along in those years and obviously it isn't

45:09.108 --> 45:18.502
anything like that now. No, not at all.

45:25.715 --> 45:48.162
So, while I can't deny that I was mighty, mighty 
happy when Fish Day came,

45:25.715 --> 45:48.162
I can also say that I enjoyed every weapon I ever 
got, except one or two, in which I thought things

45:25.715 --> 45:48.162
were abused, and I got lots of them. Well, were you 
sorry later on when they decreased the amount of

45:50.099 --> 45:54.525
hazing? I mean, there's almost no hazing at A&M in a 
physical sense, except for some push-ups, etc. In

45:58.469 --> 46:00.532
a physical sense, there's essentially none, 
that's right. Yes. Do you think that they should

46:01.133 --> 46:03.616
have continued the board? No. I was a member of the 
Century Council, and of course this question

46:03.716 --> 46:12.327
received quite a lot of consideration.

46:15.731 --> 46:19.836
And I had to vote for it going like it is going. In 
other words, decreasing hands. Decreasing,

46:21.725 --> 46:23.647
physically. Not because it was bad, but because 
you can't get something as big as the school was

46:24.448 --> 46:33.921
visualized to be on the course as it is. And have 
these kind of things

46:35.683 --> 46:48.861
going on in a routine way, because it's very 
bigness kills its effectiveness and breeds

46:50.360 --> 46:56.117
abuse.

46:56.137 --> 47:03.660
At the time that I was talking about that I was here, 
there were, I believe, five students on the campus

46:56.137 --> 47:03.660
who were not in the
