WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:06.786
We'd go to Bryan, or we'd go to Navasota, or the 
other town down there. Huntsville, maybe? No, no.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.552
Huntsville was too difficult to get to. Navasota 
and . . . Wellburn, it's between, but that's not

00:15.076 --> 00:17.519
even a town. No, there's two towns there.

00:25.789 --> 00:28.311
You had pretty good train connections to 
Navasota, did you? Oh, yeah, perfect. And on the

00:30.727 --> 00:33.251
Bryan, I presume you rode the trolley. Yeah. Was it 
electric when you were there, or was it gasoline?

00:37.478 --> 00:40.763
No, I believe it was electric. Did you go to Bryan 
very often? No. Well, as a freshman, I imagine you

00:45.170 --> 00:46.793
wouldn't go. You would not have been able to go as 
often as .. Well, I didn't want to go. There wasn't

00:50.058 --> 00:52.482
anything to go for.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.391
What was the attitude of the students to the 
administration? This would have been both to

01:01.072 --> 01:06.381
President Bezell and to the commandant. Very 
good, very good. Who was the commandant?

01:14.975 --> 01:17.019
Was Ike Ashburn there while you were there? Yeah, 
he was there, but I don't believe he was

01:17.760 --> 01:19.643
commandant. He was commandant, and he had been 
there for a number of years. Was he an annual head?

01:23.528 --> 01:25.591
Was it money changed to leave by G. Brown? No. Brown 
was their hill? No. OK, those are two that were

01:30.298 --> 01:32.441
about that period. It must have been a high 
casualty. I bet you. A high casualty. That's who it

01:36.687 --> 01:41.353
was.

01:41.373 --> 01:50.987
One of the things that I feel that makes A&M an 
interesting school and somewhat unique in the

01:41.373 --> 01:50.987
number of traditions that are carried on at this 
point largely through the Corps of Cadets, but in a

01:51.473 --> 01:57.500
sense by the whole student body. And that's such 
things as yell practice, silver taps, the

01:57.520 --> 02:06.592
bonfire, the annual muster, and so forth. Do you 
recall any of these being carried on while you were

02:07.533 --> 02:12.499
there? Oh, yeah, the bonfire. Oh, you can't miss 
that. What kind of bonfire did you build while you

02:19.030 --> 02:21.432
were there? Just old trees and things. We built up 
some big ones down by the Y. Oh, terrific. Where did

02:28.759 --> 02:30.420
you have your bonfire? Down by the Y.

02:35.345 --> 02:38.648
That would have been across from the drill field 
then? Well, no. Mitchell, in there between

02:42.031 --> 02:47.856
Mitchell and the Y. Oh, OK. Nowadays, they build 
them over on the inner mural. Oh, let's see. It's

02:54.723 --> 02:56.025
changed up so much. It used to be those streets, 
pretty narrow. There wasn't all that finery. We

03:03.092 --> 03:04.574
didn't have much finery. Pretty plain. I've seen 
pictures of the campus at that point. Were there

03:09.900 --> 03:14.805
any students living in tents during the year or so 
that you were there? I don't think so. You know, I

03:21.557 --> 03:26.522
hear some talk and everything, but I don't think 
so. I don't think there's anyone in tents when I was

03:26.582 --> 03:30.745
there. Did you have a muster? Oh, yeah. In April, 
the same day that they have the muster today. Yeah,

03:37.692 --> 03:39.834
yeah, you bet.

03:44.618 --> 03:44.758
And At various times, we know that there were a few 
girls who would attend classes. These would be

03:50.232 --> 03:53.918
daughters or sisters or something, a faculty 
member. Were there any girls in any of the classes

03:54.419 --> 03:56.602
when you were there? Quite a few girls worked 
there, but none of them went to any classes with me.

04:12.582 --> 04:16.247
We know that a lot of times the students had a 
part-time job. And I know you had a good bit of

04:16.747 --> 04:24.097
experience working in your father's 
establishment. Did you ever have a job while you

04:24.137 --> 04:26.761
were at school the year you were there?

04:32.148 --> 04:36.133
As far as I'm concerned, there wasn't anything I 
could do. What I mean, there wasn't anything

04:37.495 --> 04:39.457
available for me. I see.

04:43.058 --> 04:44.940
Have you found who the commandant was?

04:48.024 --> 04:52.870
This is probably the... You talk about a fine man, 
that J.W. Grace. He was one of the nicest looking

04:53.331 --> 04:55.414
men. That Tim Griesenbeck was something. He was a 
football player. That's the Longhorn staff

05:00.941 --> 05:02.923
there, I see.

05:16.775 --> 05:17.857
Yeah, Brazil.

05:23.966 --> 05:24.346
Crane. Colonel Crane was commandant. He had been 
there earlier, I believe. Yeah, but he left, I

05:27.872 --> 05:30.996
guess, in 17. Yes, I remember him. He was quite old.

05:41.232 --> 05:45.398
Earlier, you indicated that in about October of 
1918, Your father calls you home because of an

05:45.867 --> 05:52.696
illness of your brother, and you never went back to 
school after that. Right. When you went back home

05:54.658 --> 05:58.503
then, did you go back to work for your father? No, I 
went to farming. My brother had about 200 acres of

06:01.006 --> 06:14.423
wheat that hadn't quite finished planting, and I 
just took over, and I guess I farmed for...

06:17.440 --> 06:18.241
Two years. This was in the vicinity of Wills Point? 
In Wills Point. Yeah, two miles out. So you did

06:25.190 --> 06:28.275
wheat farming for two years. And cotton. And 
cotton. What did you do after that tenure? I left

06:35.184 --> 06:46.519
and went over to Cooper, Delta County, and went to 
work for a contractor hauling with mules and wagon

06:35.184 --> 06:46.519
hauling, concrete aggregate to build the county 
bridges. And that's the time that I met Mr. P.B.

06:54.173 --> 06:57.700
Keller, who was Helen Keller's brother. He became 
the vice president of Gifford Hill for so many

06:58.723 --> 07:06.600
years, a real fine man.

07:07.745 --> 07:09.527
For how long did you work? Just one year. One year. 
Then I came back home and farmed two years. Then I

07:13.773 --> 07:16.476
went to work for Gifford Hill and Company. Okay. 
Now, was Gifford Hill, was that a Mr. Gifford and a

07:17.137 --> 07:22.604
Mr. Hill? Right. That's right. Was the Hill one of 
your brothers? Right. Which one was that? Birch,

07:28.311 --> 07:29.613
the oldest one. One was 16. He was class of 16. 13. 
13. 13. And did you work, how long did you work for

07:34.778 --> 07:38.144
Gifford Hill? Well I started to work for him the 
first day of July and Gifford Hill made the

07:38.925 --> 07:52.608
corporation the 10th of July and I worked for him 
till the fifth day of January, 32. And then I bought

07:55.872 --> 08:18.098
I was superintendent in Louisiana through the 
long days, and we were taking script for money, and

07:55.872 --> 08:18.098
I bought 30 head of mules, a shovel, a road camp, a 
tent, you know, where the people lived, and a cook

07:55.872 --> 08:18.098
shack, Fresno's, blacksmith shop,

07:55.872 --> 08:18.098
all for $1,500. I bought the job and all. and the man 
just got in his car and drove across. Didn't go down

08:23.704 --> 08:24.565
the road. He went right out across the woods. And 32 
was a very bad year financially. There just wasn't

08:34.959 --> 08:36.361
any money. Well, was Gifford Hill primarily a road 
construction? No. Railroad and sand and gravel.

08:44.072 --> 08:44.432
Railroad. I was the only one that did the road 
construction. I subbed from them, see, and that's

08:49.147 --> 08:58.662
the reason I never owned any stock in Gifford Hill, 
any part of it, so I could trade with my brother at

08:49.147 --> 08:58.662
arm length.

09:01.306 --> 09:05.212
So in 32, then, you bought out. Right. What name did 
you give to your company when you bought out? No, I

09:12.687 --> 09:15.372
worked in Gifford Hill's name. They were supposed 
to own it. I was just superintendent. I see. You

09:18.377 --> 09:19.819
bought it in their name. No, I bought it in my name, 
but as far as the record's concerned, we had two

09:20.400 --> 09:25.389
sets of books. Gifford Hill had one in the Dallas 
office, and I had my own in the field. But see, that

09:30.939 --> 09:37.851
way, at that time, the engineers were rather... 
I'd say slightly Nixon, pro-Nixon, they had to

09:38.759 --> 09:45.448
hand out. And as it was, as I was superintendent, I 
had no means of giving them any money. They

09:50.094 --> 09:53.379
couldn't get to Dallas, the Dallas office. So that 
went on from 1932 to 1948. And my brother never

09:57.484 --> 10:02.731
closed his door in the office up there. It was 
always open. unless it was something special. So

10:06.642 --> 10:09.867
one day I went in and he said, son, close the door. I 
closed the door. He says, you have to leave Gifford

10:12.451 --> 10:15.896
Hill. I said, have I done something wrong? He said, 
no. He said, some of the contractors say are saying

10:24.710 --> 10:33.378
that we give you the sand and gravel and the pipe is 
the reason you can beat them on the jobs, and you're

10:24.710 --> 10:33.378
hurting our business. Said, you have some good 
equipment, some good people, and you just go in

10:33.398 --> 10:43.167
your own name. But he says, you don't have any 
credit. I said, I don't need any credit. We was

10:48.812 --> 10:51.915
living in Sherman at that time, and I said, 
$183,000 of E-bonds paid for. And I checked my bank

10:55.081 --> 10:59.247
account yesterday, and I had about $195,000 in it. 
He said, you don't understand. You can't buy

11:02.853 --> 11:04.615
anything. He said, you go to the M&P Bank, the 
president's a real good friend of yours, and you

11:05.437 --> 11:17.615
borrow $50,000 for 30 days and pay him the interest 
and pay it back, which I did. And he said, then you go

11:18.516 --> 11:20.940
back in there the next day And you borrow $100,000 
for 30 days, and you pay them back. I couldn't

11:25.001 --> 11:30.305
understand why I'd be paying Interstone money 
when I had all that money in that bank account. But

11:30.325 --> 11:36.771
then I'd establish my credit, which is a rather 
unusual way to do it. Yeah. But you had never had

11:38.072 --> 11:40.755
occasion to borrow any money prior to that. I 
didn't. I wanted to work and give a real name

11:42.036 --> 11:45.259
because I got all their buying power. And if I 
needed $50,000, that's all I'd do right there. And

11:48.983 --> 11:53.349
in Dallas, deposit $50,000 in a certain bank 
wherever I was doing bidding. And then, of course,

11:54.111 --> 11:57.736
the estimate was in Gifford Hill's name and went to 
them. In Dallas, I never touched any money except

11:58.898 --> 12:06.910
write to payroll and draw what money I had to have to 
live on.

12:09.654 --> 12:13.219
So what took place then in 48? Oh, I did real good. 
Did you then kind of sever connections with

12:16.382 --> 12:20.226
Gifford Hill? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. They just 
didn't bid for me. I bid in my own name. You bid in

12:25.791 --> 12:26.872
your own name. Yeah, I had to. I bid in my own name. 
But up to that time, even though it was really your

12:29.174 --> 12:37.482
own company, if you were going to bid on a job to 
build a road or something, you would bid in the name

12:29.174 --> 12:37.482
of Gifford Hill. Oh, yes, yes. Did that so I could 
have their buying power, and then the people

12:39.104 --> 12:43.628
couldn't touch me that... Since I was a 
superintendent, I wasn't supposed to give them

12:43.844 --> 12:48.110
anything. You say the engineers were looking for a 
handout. I don't want to say too much about that.

12:54.839 --> 13:02.590
But, see, we worked in Louisiana, Arkansas, 
Mississippi, and everything, and they were

12:54.839 --> 13:02.590
really tough. In fact, if you cut that off one 
minute, please, so I don't want to get this on.

13:11.333 --> 13:30.800
Well, one of the most interesting things, I think, 
that happened in all our life, we were living in

13:11.333 --> 13:30.800
Henderson, Texas, and I was out on a job, and my 
brother called my wife and told me, told her that we

13:11.333 --> 13:30.800
must move to Sherman, Texas. That day, they had 
gotten Perrin Field. Perrin Field was the first

13:34.566 --> 13:39.012
area of fields that they built in the south before 
Pearl Harbor. We started on the fourth day of July

13:39.700 --> 13:50.536
and finished up, oh, I'd say the latter part of 
October before Pearl Harbor. Well, no, the latter

13:51.598 --> 13:55.944
part of November, and then December the 7th, Pearl 
Harbor. And then at that time, we were working in

13:56.965 --> 14:07.581
Dallas building that North American plane plant 
parking area and the building and all. So you were

14:08.742 --> 14:11.566
involved in the construction of Perrin Field. I 
built half of it. You had the contract. Yeah,

14:14.810 --> 14:15.471
Gifford Hill. Gifford Hill had the contract. 
Yeah, but I owned this outfit at that time, 41. But

14:22.020 --> 14:27.207
Bell and Braden at that time were in Amarillo, and 
it was a mile square. So we cut it in two halfway from

14:27.527 --> 14:33.135
the east to the west, and I took the south end. And we 
moved, oh, about 4 million yards of dirt there. And

14:39.438 --> 14:42.342
at that time, there's no way to buy any equipment. 
It was all frozen. And we had to lease it, borrow it,

14:44.225 --> 14:47.310
do anything we could. But we made it. After

14:50.335 --> 15:06.740
48, when your brother called you in and said you 
were going to have to leave Gifford Hill, did you

14:50.335 --> 15:06.740
then give your company your own name? Oh, yeah. 
E.B. Hill. E.B. Hill. E.B. Hill Contractor. It's

15:12.648 --> 15:14.411
not a stock company. No, no. Owned every bit of it. 
So then we had an opportunity to buy the

15:18.237 --> 15:25.990
Caterpillar dealership here in Amarillo from 
R.B. George in Dallas. And my last job was at Lufkin

15:28.194 --> 15:31.118
in 51. And then I started selling my equipment 
there. And we bought a Caterpillar deal here in

15:35.834 --> 15:43.465
Amarillo, which was West Texas Equipment 
Company, a corporation. And I owned about 51% of

15:44.447 --> 15:51.437
it, and this partner in Amarillo owned part of it. 
And then the little manager out here owned, I

15:51.517 --> 15:56.585
think, 15 shares, something like that. 2,000 
shares, what it was. And then we ran that for, say,

15:59.307 --> 16:05.334
to 66, I think. And then I had some trouble with my 
heart. And my doctor told me, EB, you have too much

16:07.677 --> 16:11.942
pressure on you, you're going to die. And my heart 
was 2 and 1 half inches too large. So he gave me two

16:15.366 --> 16:17.949
years to sell out. And

16:18.069 --> 16:23.516
after a year, then my heart was back normal. And 
I've been doing real good since. So you're still in

16:26.071 --> 16:29.075
the Caterpillar dealership? No, no, no. You sold 
that out? I'm in the finance business. I'm

16:33.580 --> 16:41.509
financing some of the customers, the good 
customers I had out there, not so much as I was. I

16:44.112 --> 16:46.355
like the CDs now better than the other. At 11.5% 
interest. Where can you get a CD for 11.5%? I get

16:52.683 --> 16:54.044
them all the time. Well, it depends. If you have 
enough to invest, I presume. Yeah, you've got to

16:58.579 --> 17:00.242
have 100,000.

17:03.267 --> 17:07.855
What would you say was your biggest job you ever 
handled in contracting? Oh, the parent field. The

17:09.257 --> 17:09.958
parent field was. But the best job I ever had in my 
life, if you have been over from the Parker County

17:10.839 --> 17:19.213
line eight miles to Weatherford, And down the 
bottom, there's these twin bridges, you know,

17:19.852 --> 17:22.536
right? They're beautiful. And pecan trees all 
around them and everything. I built that in 1938.

17:28.504 --> 17:34.453
And the equipment was very hard to come by. And that 
was the first time I'd ever been west of Fort Worth.

17:39.079 --> 17:43.125
Because a rock would tear your equipment up so bad, 
I stayed back in the dirt. But I had a $282,000 job,

17:44.438 --> 17:50.103
and it was cheap. 50 cent rock, 15 cent dirt, $15 
concrete. It was cheap. So I had four contractor

17:58.210 --> 18:05.636
friends told me that says, you can't do it for that 
money. I said, oh, yes, I'm going to do it. I said,

18:08.519 --> 18:11.682
Gifford Hill's going to make bond, and I'm going to 
build the job. And I made 60. I bought it. and paid

18:14.476 --> 18:19.603
for everything on the job and made $64,000 cash. 
And that kicked me over. Then we moved to Henderson

18:22.387 --> 18:28.495
and got about a million and a quarter yards of dirt. 
Did real good on it. And then from then on, we could

18:29.717 --> 18:33.161
see daylight. But we had some pretty tough times. 
Well, getting started, when you did in one of the

18:36.406 --> 18:43.335
worst economic periods we've ever had, Yeah, see, 
I went through 1919 and 1929. And at the time when 29

18:48.691 --> 18:54.117
came, it never did bother us. We were building.

19:00.845 --> 19:08.514
I

19:00.845 --> 19:08.514
was

19:00.845 --> 19:08.514
building. I was superintendent for Gifford Hill. 
We built 144 miles, the Cotton Belt Railroad from

19:13.724 --> 19:21.416
Mount Pleasant to Corsicana, moving about four 
and a quarter million yards of dirt. We did it with

19:22.458 --> 19:30.149
mules, tractors, drag lines, shovels, every 
means in the world. Dump cars. And we did 50 and 60

19:32.914 --> 19:37.841
foot cuts under traffic. We had to carry the 
traffic as well as, What we'd do, we'd take a cut

19:41.905 --> 19:54.239
through and lay what we called a shoe fly track 
around and put the traffic over there and tear up

19:41.905 --> 19:54.239
this line and then go down with the cut and just 
crisscross that away. Lots of track land and stuff

19:54.299 --> 19:57.002
like that. But we had five big outfits there. And 
then in the 31, after everyone else had really hit,

19:59.545 --> 20:10.697
Gippert Hill wound up with a world of equipment. No 
money. So I

20:13.230 --> 20:23.781
was making $450 a month, an automobile, an expense 
account. And my brother called me to Dallas, took

20:23.801 --> 20:31.989
my car, my expense account, and cut my salary to 
$175 a month. It says go to Bell's, Tennessee.

20:34.071 --> 20:35.452
That's right near Jackson. It's 90 miles to the 
other side of Memphis, Tennessee. And when I came

20:42.959 --> 20:47.483
home, I told my wife, my brother has to do this to me. 
I'll never work for another person. So it wasn't

20:49.605 --> 20:54.049
much over a year from then until I got my own out 
there. And I did real well.

20:58.553 --> 21:06.359
How much of a problem was it taking care of a whole 
bunch of mules that you used on your construction

20:58.553 --> 21:06.359
job when you first started? Well, it wasn't any 
problem at all. We had plenty of labor. What was

21:11.344 --> 21:12.865
wrong? when it rained for 10 days or something like 
that, and you couldn't. And then every time that

21:17.346 --> 21:24.613
rain would hit the roof, I'm pardoned, no more 
sleep for me that night. I spent lots of sleepless

21:25.974 --> 21:28.497
nights, that's all. There's no problem. Keeping 
the meals calm? Keeping them fed. Doctoring them

21:32.361 --> 21:35.624
all night. Work them all day, and then we'd stay up 
all night and doctor them. Crush ice and put on

21:40.769 --> 21:43.071
their heads. Louisiana is terrible, you know, to 
have a brain concussion. I had three young mules

21:50.049 --> 21:54.014
that I'd bought, and I watched them. I'd stand them 
so I could watch them. When they make them a step,

21:56.957 --> 21:59.300
you know that they're getting too hot. But I had a 
man with a five-gallon bucket at one end and five

22:00.141 --> 22:06.028
gallons at the end, and it hit their nostrils. 
Every load, it was dusty. And I saw this mule make a

22:08.245 --> 22:11.088
misstep. And before I could get... They were about 
four of them here to the guest house down there.

22:15.594 --> 22:19.418
Before I could get two of them, all three of them 
dropped dead in the harness. That's hard to take.

22:23.263 --> 22:25.345
That's one of the things I wouldn't want to go back 
through. What would you say would be some of the

22:26.407 --> 22:36.058
principal developments in the technology of road 
building during the time that you were involved in

22:26.407 --> 22:36.058
road building? Well, there was every change in the 
world. Of course, we started out a little slip, you

22:41.379 --> 22:49.390
know, with two handles and two mules. That's where 
we removed most of the dirt. Then we came to the

22:51.032 --> 22:56.139
Fresno, you know, that has the dump. And then we 
came to what they call the wheelers. That was the

23:00.524 --> 23:10.619
worst piece of machinery in the world because the 
weight of all that dirt and everything were right

23:00.524 --> 23:10.619
on these mules' necks, and there's no way to 
protect it. Oh, their necks got so bad. I never

23:16.107 --> 23:16.928
owned one. I said I'll never put one of my mules to 
that torture to have a wheeler. I've never used a

23:23.377 --> 23:24.258
wheeler. I've used a slip in a Fresnel. Yeah, well, 
a wheeler, That tongue, they've got to hold that.

23:29.423 --> 23:33.589
And if that dirt is out here, all that weight's 
right on that tongue. And the only way in the world

23:33.649 --> 23:37.314
to hold it up is for those mules' necks. It's just 
terrible.

23:43.121 --> 23:49.650
So you've come from that to really heavy equipment 
to move whatever you need to move. Yeah, we started

23:49.934 --> 23:57.022
out, the first tractor I ever had was what they call 
a 60. That's an old, well,

23:57.302 --> 24:06.733
kind of the chug-a-lug type, you know. Then in 
1935, I bought my first diesel, diesel 50. It

24:14.942 --> 24:16.043
was... 50 horsepower, is the reason they call it 
that. And of course, it was quite something,

24:19.371 --> 24:25.120
getting away from the gasoline and burning 
diesel. Much cheaper and much better operated. It

24:28.345 --> 24:29.327
runs smoother. When,

24:29.407 --> 24:35.196
uh... Did you ever have anything very much to do 
with the design of a road? Oh, no. I worked for the

24:42.708 --> 24:48.195
engineers when I was a kid, 15, 16 years old. County 
engineers, you know, set stakes, and then when it

24:48.856 --> 24:56.786
rained, we'd have to work in the office, you know, 
and figure the volume, you know. Yes, I've done

24:58.168 --> 25:00.511
some engineering quite a bit. But not after you had 
gone to A&M. You were always involved in

25:04.196 --> 25:05.858
construction work. Never had anything to do with 
it. The knowledge of being a contractor and

25:09.772 --> 25:28.584
starting out like we did is being able to know 
people, to know the ability of what they can do and

25:09.772 --> 25:28.584
get out of them what you should. And a lot of people 
don't know that. A lot of people think that people

25:30.762 --> 25:36.609
can just work continuously and never have to get up 
for breath, but that's not true. Man has to rest a

25:37.190 --> 25:41.175
little bit once in a while. And then some people can 
do some things and some people can't do things.

25:46.061 --> 25:48.884
Some people can use a shovel and others can't use a 
shovel. Some of them can use a hoe and some of them

25:49.805 --> 25:52.048
can't use it. Some of them can use a axe. And I think 
being able to know what a person can do helps you a

25:53.810 --> 26:00.178
lot in the construction business. And another 
thing, I'm always, my organization, I take great

26:00.547 --> 26:13.600
pride that I don't believe that we ever put a yard of 
dirt in our life the wrong place. When we picked it

26:13.620 --> 26:16.042
up, we put it where it belonged. You knew where it 
was going before you picked it up. Right. That was

26:18.645 --> 26:19.886
number one. Now, this superintendent, he's my 
bookkeeper now. We were born and reared about six

26:22.689 --> 26:26.993
blocks from each other. My birthday is the 1st of 
December. His is the 16th of January. I'm that much

26:31.252 --> 26:34.976
older than you. But a scraper could come by him with 
a $2,500 tire on just flat, and he couldn't see it.

26:43.224 --> 26:50.031
But if that man had come by with a half a load of dirt, 
he'd just have a tantrum. And that's just part of

26:50.051 --> 26:51.833
it.

26:55.103 --> 26:57.106
didn't come by with a half full. It had to be all the 
way full. Right. Right. And it had to go the right

27:00.430 --> 27:02.513
place. Well, I imagine it costs just about as much 
to move it when it's half full as it does when it's

27:02.533 --> 27:07.740
all the way full. Right. At that man's time and that 
gas fuel and everything, it's just got to be sure

27:08.280 --> 27:15.530
that they're loaded. Yeah.

27:22.610 --> 27:26.936
Since you've been out of the Caterpillar 
dealership, what have you been involved in?

27:26.996 --> 27:29.098
Financing. Financing the customers of the 
Caterpillar. Right. Are you involved in any kind

27:34.666 --> 27:39.552
of social or political activities? Not much. Not 
much. Not political. I have a lot of friends in

27:43.117 --> 27:51.908
politics that I admire, but I've never been 
involved. in politics, and they were so desired.

27:55.073 --> 28:03.308
Earlier, you mentioned, I believe, while we had 
the machine off, that you went to London with the

27:55.073 --> 28:03.308
Former Students Association. Oh, yes. Was that a 
pretty enjoyable trip? Wonderful. Wonderful.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.843
Have you done much other foreign travel? Oh, yes. 
Well, earlier you said you had a... A boy from Lima,

28:16.424 --> 28:19.929
Peru that you tried to go see a couple of years ago, 
and he passed away. We have a granddaughter that

28:19.950 --> 28:22.714
lives in Venezuela. Caracas. We spent 17 days 
there in February. We're going back and spending

28:26.179 --> 28:27.601
Christmas. We can't. Here, you have to be gone in 
the winter months and see the first of April. This

28:35.442 --> 28:40.791
garden and this yard, from then to the first of 
November, you might say, you're tied. It's a

28:40.812 --> 28:41.773
full-time job. Well, you can't get any help here. 
You can get a help here and pay them $2.50 an hour and

28:43.957 --> 28:50.649
give them their time, pay them their time while 
they're eating lunch, feed them. Next week, they

28:51.711 --> 28:55.437
won't be back. There's more work here than there 
are people to do it. I believe at one point you said,

29:01.143 --> 29:03.867
what, you have four daughters? Three. Three 
daughters. And how many grandchildren? Ten

29:07.532 --> 29:08.393
grandchildren. Seven little girls and three 
little boys. But you had no son of your own? No. I had

29:16.185 --> 29:23.055
a redefined son-in-law that was in Venice with me 
out there, and he was killed two years ago in July.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.880
He was a shell jobber in Wichita Falls and that. 
Charlotte's taken it over and just made a terrific

29:27.620 --> 29:31.565
success of it. She has a 16-year-old boy and a 
14-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. So your

29:36.992 --> 29:39.755
daughters have some of your business equivalent, 
too? She is quite a business figure. And our oldest

29:42.319 --> 29:46.003
daughter, she's married to a dentist over here. 
She had one of the brightest minds as far as

29:46.504 --> 29:51.450
figures, you know, about paying bills.

29:55.953 --> 29:58.116
I have to show you this.
