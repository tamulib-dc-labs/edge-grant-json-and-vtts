Samuel Montoya, self-employed mechanic, Bryan, 
Texas, approximately 61 years old, interviewed

00:06.157 --> 00:19.317
May 3, 1975, by Adela Lopez and Jim Crisp.

00:22.622 --> 00:34.780
He lost his father, and then his mother and his 
brothers

00:22.622 --> 00:34.780
came into Floresville. And from Floresville, 
they had a hard time. So they heard about having,

00:38.999 --> 00:45.106
down in Southeast Texas, having a big saw mill 
there. So they hit the saw mills. When they hit the

00:47.549 --> 00:50.592
saw mills, well then, they found a way out. And my 
father was lucky. He was a blacksmith by trade. And

01:00.203 --> 01:04.108
he was a, what do you call this? Flatheads. Do you 
know what a flathead is? I don't know what a

01:08.888 --> 01:10.790
flathead is. It's one of these big worms, white 
worms that grow in trees. They feed in the trees.

01:16.979 --> 01:19.122
They call them flatheads. He saw logs. They call 
them flatheads. Log sawyers.

01:28.736 --> 01:30.378
He saw logs for many years. He built a sawmill in 
Brandcroft, Texas. That's about 10 miles, maybe

01:36.727 --> 01:45.277
15 miles from Orange, Texas, in Orange County. And 
then from there, he moved to Texla back in 1923. I

01:51.685 --> 02:01.076
remember from there, I owned real good then, 
because in 1923, I was chasing rabbits,

01:51.685 --> 02:01.076
squirrels, all that. And I was big enough to do that 
and get lost. Spend a night in the woods and find my

02:04.973 --> 02:09.979
way back next day by the sun. And well, I finally 
grew up, went to school. I went to school at the age

02:16.026 --> 02:18.389
of nine. And I started naturally with the little 
ones. And I was a giant for the little ones. But I

02:24.957 --> 02:28.020
learned to read and write. And I finished my years 
in school in sixth grade. Well, I did finish sixth

02:34.505 --> 02:36.968
grade, though. I graduated from sixth grade. Or 
which awaited one.

02:42.655 --> 02:52.086
And then from there, it was back in 1932,

02:42.655 --> 02:52.086
we lived in Deweyville. And that place still 
stands. It's a pretty little town. It's getting to

02:54.970 --> 02:59.255
be a good little business there. I have a few 
friends there yet that we went to school together.

03:04.458 --> 03:06.740
And 32, we hit Brian. Well, my uncle was a mechanic 
here for the Missouri Pacific. And he kept up to

03:14.126 --> 03:16.808
that steam engine there. And he wrote to me in that 
year, asking me to come to Brian and visit him. So by

03:26.176 --> 03:28.959
that time, sawmill had played out. So we didn't 
have a job. My daddy didn't have a job. And we was

03:32.322 --> 03:34.043
looking for a way out. When this car comes in, I had 
me a Model T that I bought back in 28. And that's

03:39.263 --> 03:46.491
where I learned my automobile trade. When I was 
going to school, there was a man by the name of,

03:46.531 --> 03:57.402
well, Shannon. And he was an engineer there for the 
sawmill that he built. these

04:03.115 --> 04:09.282
engines, these locomotives. And he started 
building one. And I asked him, Shannon, what are

04:12.726 --> 04:15.169
you going to do here? He says, I'm going to build me a 
locomotive. Wow, I'd like to see that. He says,

04:19.034 --> 04:23.880
well, we're going to build it from the rail up. And 
you can see it every day. You may come by and see what

04:26.923 --> 04:30.307
progress we have. So there were two men working. 
But he was the head engineer. I got to see that

04:36.060 --> 04:44.127
engine, get out of that shop, and I got to maneuver 
the thing. I was big enough. The only thing was that

04:44.908 --> 04:47.871
I wasn't strong enough to pull that big lever. That 
was pretty heavy to do. But when I did, I got pretty

04:50.093 --> 04:56.219
smart and found ways to do it with a club. And I moved 
that engine. I stopped it. Then I got a little

04:59.682 --> 05:01.624
bigger. That other little engine that was smaller 
than that, that was pretty easy to move. It was half

05:07.433 --> 05:08.635
worn out. That really was easy. But I managed to 
learn how to move a locomotive real good and all

05:10.578 --> 05:15.165
that. And then that was back in 28, 29. Then we moved 
from Texas to Deauville. That's when we came to

05:24.418 --> 05:26.902
Bryan. When I came to Bryan, my uncle was taking 
care of this big locomotive. It was 900 horses in

05:33.997 --> 05:36.180
it. Of course, to compare a mobile nowadays, that 
engine wasn't very big. But it still was a big

05:42.668 --> 05:44.150
thing. But my cousin said, Sam, I'm going to show 
you how to operate this engine. I said, well, I

05:53.362 --> 05:59.529
learned a few days ago that a man's going to put 
things together. You do it first. And then you read

06:01.443 --> 06:03.766
the instructions before you made a mistake. He 
said, you're doing it backwards. I said, that's

06:06.731 --> 06:07.893
what I want to tell you. Let me see if I do it 
backwards here. He said, no, no, no, because this

06:10.256 --> 06:12.820
thing might get away from you. I said, oh, what? 
What so? The engineer here with me can always stop

06:15.504 --> 06:18.228
it. Oh, he felt big then. I said, well, now, first 
thing, we pull this lever here back to make it back

06:22.615 --> 06:26.901
up. And we pull the throttle a little at a time so it 
won't spin. And you stop it, you pull this lever

06:31.548 --> 06:35.894
here, and it stopped it. Hydraulics. Oh, you don't 
know that? Well, I'm an old man, you know. I was

06:41.802 --> 06:45.307
about 18, 17, 18 then. I said, well, I'll show you 
that. I got around.

06:54.859 --> 06:57.203
I said, well, I do know this. By that, in a way, I know 
more than this. being a Chevrolet or Ford, I don't

07:02.750 --> 07:11.123
care where he breaks down or where he stops, I'll 
get that thing going right there. Now I know that.

07:14.809 --> 07:15.771
He said, well, you learned that. Well, I tell you, 
old days.

07:22.822 --> 07:25.767
Well, he was very surprised, because I did. Drive 
my car there and And every time we have a little

07:29.463 --> 07:32.287
problem with it, I fix it. What's going on? Well, 
from then on, he didn't have a thing to say to me. I

07:38.555 --> 07:43.080
said, another thing, I would like to make a boat 
since we have the river here pretty close. I can

07:44.042 --> 07:49.508
make a boat out of some light lumber and let's go 
fishing. I like fishing. Oh, no. I can't do it. Oh,

07:55.676 --> 07:56.137
well. So by that time, uh, We had been here about, 
oh, I'd say 18 days, and the cotton field opened up

07:58.673 --> 08:09.809
for shopping cotton. I never did know what a cotton 
field was, so I took my hoe, and we went with a bunch

08:09.829 --> 08:24.852
to Dr.

08:09.829 --> 08:24.852
Richardson's farm. We went there to that farm, and 
We started chopping cotton for the whole day, from

08:27.817 --> 08:30.761
sunup to sundown.

08:33.444 --> 08:35.928
We chopped cotton for that season. And then when 
the cotton harvest came in, we went cotton

08:35.948 --> 08:43.598
picking. But I didn't have cotton picking hands.

08:49.045 --> 08:54.212
It so happened that we went to the chancellor's 
place to pick cotton. I tried my best to, and cotton

08:54.766 --> 08:57.589
was just right. I mean, right size and plenty of it 
and all that. But my cotton picking hands weren't

09:01.073 --> 09:03.716
there. Forget it. Told my dad, I was making, I was 
pulling 50 pounds of cotton a day from sunup to

09:05.859 --> 09:13.467
sundown. I couldn't see anymore. I said, this is 
going to kill me and store me to death. I better

09:18.153 --> 09:18.973
move. I said, I think I'm going to find a job and go 
write somewhere in Bryant. So I left. I said, I'll

09:24.652 --> 09:26.714
be back for you all Saturday morning. So I came to 
Brian. And just lucky that day, that Tuesday

09:29.596 --> 09:35.642
morning, I went down the street. Saw this wrecking 
yard right there by 23rd and Brian. I said, there's

09:43.749 --> 09:45.671
a wrecking yard. I'm going to see if I can find it. I 
went in there, inquired about the man's name. I

09:49.575 --> 09:52.698
said, Mr. Brogdon? Yes, sir. I'm looking for a job. 
Oh, a lot of people are looking for a job now. Well,

10:00.430 --> 10:03.613
there's a lot of cotton back in the field. What are 
you looking for? Well, what are you? I said, I just

10:05.776 --> 10:06.917
come from there. I don't have cotton picking 
hands. He said, well, what can you do? I said, I can

10:12.423 --> 10:14.305
repair automobiles. Oh, you look mighty young to 
know anything about that. I said, well, just try me

10:18.289 --> 10:19.971
out. He said, well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll 
give you $3 a week. I said, that's good enough. That

10:26.662 --> 10:27.943
bit's cotton fake. And I went to work for him for $3 a 
week. But I enjoyed myself in that sense. Really,

10:36.030 --> 10:41.094
the thing was that I didn't care about how much 
money I made. The thing was that experiencing

10:41.515 --> 10:53.265
other automobiles, like the Moon, like the 
Whippet, like the Star, you name them, they were

10:41.515 --> 10:53.265
there. I was working on them and fixing tires. He 
had a sign there. He said, you bust them, we fix

10:59.273 --> 11:01.876
them. And we fixed batteries. I learned how to 
rebuild a battery. In fact, I built one that I put

11:06.762 --> 11:08.484
in. But then he had a good Chevrolet there that I 
traded my Ford for and gave him $25 a boot. And that

11:16.012 --> 11:17.494
Chevrolet didn't have a battery. I said, it was 
broken. I'm going to make me a battery and put it in

11:18.275 --> 11:21.599
my car. He said, yeah, go on, do it. So I built me a 
battery. And I drove that car five years. And when I

11:27.483 --> 11:29.966
sold the car, the battery wasn't in that car yet. I 
said, I must have been a good battery

11:31.028 --> 11:35.614
manufacturer. And I was surprised at that 
battery. So I had good luck with it. And then in 33, I

11:42.824 --> 11:47.911
joined the CC camp. I thought I knew enough in 
automobiles to go to the CC camp. get some other

11:53.557 --> 12:00.043
kind of experience, so I was took, I tell you. Well, 
then we got in with this bunch of boys here in Bryan.

12:04.067 --> 12:07.290
We went to, they took us to Arizona, Alpine. And 
there we were, well, I went to a lot of places there

12:08.531 --> 12:16.238
after, like, for instance, Saturday and Sunday 
that we didn't work. Flagstaff and

12:17.520 --> 12:22.264
Holbrook and Other little places and rivers.

12:28.937 --> 12:31.700
Imagine all that fish in those rivers and I can't 
go. And those days I'd go, that's a lot of fish

12:33.502 --> 12:36.245
there. Why do that? You care too much about 
fishing. It's better because I want to move

12:40.209 --> 12:42.152
around. I thought if I sit down and fish, I'd lose 
time. I'd be traveling while I had the

12:46.797 --> 12:50.261
opportunity. So I kept going, kept going. Well, in 
July of 33, I came back to Bryant. I didn't like

12:58.809 --> 12:59.730
Bryant. But I didn't have a choice. I had to go to 
work in A&M College at Mass Hall to make a living. I

13:11.826 --> 13:13.569
done had all the traveling. I was tired of 
traveling. And I almost held out for a while and

13:15.812 --> 13:18.435
rest. And, well, what else I might think of? So I 
worked there at the mess hall one session, which it

13:22.825 --> 13:27.369
was. Well, I don't know if it was one session or 
what, but I went in there right after I got back in

13:27.629 --> 13:34.756
July. And I worked there till January the next 
year. That was 34. In 34, I went to Houston. I

13:46.807 --> 13:48.569
couldn't find a job in Houston, so I come back. I 
spent about a month there in Houston, come back.

13:52.660 --> 13:53.461
Couldn't make it. Then I went to work back again 
there. And I worked that

13:55.844 --> 14:00.911
spring there. And it was in September I went back to 
Houston. That was in 34. Got me a job at the Wright

14:11.063 --> 14:17.952
Hotel serving tables there. I took it up. Wasn't 
making very much, but making my expenses and

14:19.674 --> 14:22.498
living. having a lot of fun. And I didn't care about 
nothing else but having a lot of fun. And I did enjoy

14:29.130 --> 14:31.994
my work. I don't know why. Everywhere that I went to 
work that they treated me halfway right, I enjoyed

14:33.136 --> 14:37.602
my work. Where I wasn't treated too good, I'd left 
it. Never was afraid to leave a job. I knew I had

14:42.348 --> 14:44.010
another one somewhere else. And I'm still that 
way. Of course, here, I've been here 30 years, and I

14:47.875 --> 14:53.640
can't leave it. I have left it. I left it, I think, 
was four times to go help out somewhere, whatever

14:54.941 --> 15:01.087
they call me. I'd go there and say, let's call that a 
vacation. I had a two-month, no, no, one-month

15:05.171 --> 15:14.019
vacation in Toledo, Ohio, back in 1948. Closed up 
here and went to Toledo to work. Fifteen days

15:18.773 --> 15:20.775
later, I came to my family. We went out there. We 
couldn't live. Now let's go back home. We come back

15:25.882 --> 15:28.845
home, open up my doors, and going back to work. You 
just couldn't leave Brian, could you? No, I tried

15:30.848 --> 15:32.870
my best. I have my shoes tied here so tight that I 
can't leave. Well, I decided I'll stay home. But

15:43.343 --> 15:47.548
back in 1955, I was called from... Teddy Decker in 
Houston to go keep up his equipment. He had a nice

15:53.393 --> 15:55.757
shop and all that. He gave me a good break. Well, I 
went to work for him. I worked for him nine months. I

16:03.067 --> 16:12.321
couldn't make, I don't know why, making, I was 
making as much as I was, maybe a little more than I

16:03.067 --> 16:12.321
was making here, and I couldn't make ends meet. 
See, there's something wrong here somewhere

16:13.983 --> 16:17.468
because I know it's, It's about $35 more than I make 
at the shop. And yet, I get my gas and my oil out of the

16:22.863 --> 16:30.753
company to go to Brian and back, and yet I can't make 
it. And I wasn't paying board and room because I was

16:32.155 --> 16:40.707
living with a couple that were from Brian, and they 
wouldn't charge me a dime to live with them. I tried

16:41.327 --> 16:42.329
to pay them. I said, no, as long as you're here, you 
So you get settled. I said, heck, it might be two,

16:47.658 --> 16:50.321
three years before I get settled. He said, you got a 
home here? So I said, goodness, and yet I can't make

16:54.024 --> 16:59.169
Ian Smith. So I tell the old man, quit? Oh, you can't 
quit now. Yes, I can. He said, well, I tell you, I'm

17:05.456 --> 17:10.661
going to let you go as soon as you find me a man like 
you. I said, oh, man, I'm going to find you one

17:10.681 --> 17:12.943
better than I. He said, well, just one like you, not 
any better. Well, turning in the papers,

17:18.080 --> 17:31.239
advertised for a man that would take care of 
equipment, a maintenance man, experienced. One

17:31.259 --> 17:34.684
of the first day I had about 50 there to interview. I 
said, oh, I can't interview all of those. I told the

17:35.986 --> 17:37.368
old man, I said, come down here. He said, that's 
your job. I said, you're going to find the man. The

17:43.898 --> 17:46.281
thing was that he wanted to tie me I was already tied 
down where I couldn't get away from there, and he

17:46.497 --> 17:50.663
was going to keep me there. Said, Mr. Manley, I have 
so much work to do that I can't interview you. He

17:56.732 --> 17:59.116
said, well, you let the work go, you interview the 
people. You call them, now you get into them. Well,

18:03.242 --> 18:11.394
I tried to call the youngest ones, someone that 
looked to me like I had common sense. Well, I found

18:12.756 --> 18:14.378
several of them. I told the restaurant, well, I'll 
call you. They gave me all the address, all the

18:18.104 --> 18:26.252
phone numbers, and a book full of address, and 
telephone number, and names, and all kinds. I'll

18:27.873 --> 18:30.336
call you as soon as the old man decides. I can't hire 
you, but I will recommend the man that I think is

18:30.396 --> 18:36.842
good for the job. And the old man, oh, I say he's 
around 70. He want to beat me up because I wouldn't

18:40.926 --> 18:44.770
give him the job. Look, I need a young man. You're a 
retired man. He said, no, I'm not. I said, well,

18:53.527 --> 18:54.929
that's your hard luck. And

18:54.949 --> 18:59.894
he almost beat me up. But I said, no, come on. Come 
on. Go on. You know you can't quit me. If you could,

19:04.819 --> 19:06.241
I'd let you. But I've got some work to do. I can't 
lose that kind of a time. But he really was mad. So

19:14.315 --> 19:24.470
then after three weeks of fighting, fighting the 
boss man, I told one young man, now you're going to

19:14.315 --> 19:24.470
stay here and you just take over. I'm going home. 
And I did. And I don't know, I believe it was six

19:28.496 --> 19:36.407
months later, Mr. Mandler came to the shop here. 
And he, him and Mr. Lindsay, that neighbor there,

19:37.008 --> 19:42.516
you put them together, you think, You wouldn't 
know who was Mr. Manley. And I was working under a

19:47.329 --> 19:49.672
car. I said, how are you doing? I thought I 
recognized you. Oh, I'm doing all right.

20:00.667 --> 20:09.059
Well, when you get through there or you want to take 
a little break, let's go get some coffee.

20:09.079 --> 20:09.399
All right. So I get out and Oh, how you doing? Oh, 
just fine, let's see. But I thought it was Mr.

20:15.751 --> 20:17.573
Lindsey. Never did think of Mr. Manley anymore, so 
we talked and said a lot of things. After a while he

20:26.224 --> 20:28.467
said, you know, you don't know who I am.

20:32.953 --> 20:34.074
I said, I see you every day. He said, oh, now I know 
you don't know who I am. Yes, I do. You're Mr.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.182
Lindsey, aren't you? No. But you know that mostly 
every Monday we came in your house there and drank

20:42.402 --> 20:51.232
some coffee, chatted, you know. Oh, boy. Well, who 
are you thinking? I'm sorry. Oh, never be. Never be

20:56.818 --> 20:57.399
sorry. Let's go get some coffee. Came in here. Sit 
there like we did every Monday. I was off on Monday.

21:05.769 --> 21:09.113
And he'd come here to drink coffee with me and spend 
an hour or two with me. And then he'd go back. Well,

21:12.693 --> 21:21.601
we'd sit there and

21:12.693 --> 21:21.601
say, I don't want you to go to work, but I want you to 
do one thing. The 1st of October, I want you to come

21:22.342 --> 21:28.207
over to my office and spend an hour or two with me. I 
have something for you there. I'm retiring. I'm

21:31.991 --> 21:34.013
leaving that day, and I want you to come there. But 
one day, I was working in the shop there, and I had so

21:35.715 --> 21:41.620
much to do. I had six trucks to put up with. Besides 
that, I had some machinery in the plant that I had to

21:45.302 --> 21:49.647
work over. It looked like that week I was a little 
behind. He called me. He said, come over to the

22:00.779 --> 22:01.740
office. I need you right now. So I didn't think of 
pulling my dirty clothes off. I just washed my

22:07.446 --> 22:09.949
hands, kept my grace of heart. Went up to his 
office. There's all these big wheels there. I went

22:17.404 --> 22:19.126
to take my hand. Oh, I felt like I wanted to go in the 
floor. This was here in Brad? No, no, that was in

22:26.576 --> 22:29.460
Houston, yes. And it says, now, this is a big Brad 
from Chicago. Now, I call you because I want them to

22:38.151 --> 22:41.796
know you. They already know it by your name and what 
you do and all that. But I said, when you tell me

22:46.197 --> 22:55.412
this, dirty or clean or whatever, you're the same 
man. You're not going to change any. You're right

22:57.876 --> 23:00.019
about that. Yeah, we've got a chair, a tie, and 
whatnot. There's nobody. We're just partners in

23:05.909 --> 23:08.593
this same job. And you know, I appreciated all of 
that, because you may not have an education. Oh,

23:15.915 --> 23:20.999
boy, those big engineers and all that. It made me 
feel mighty small. But after they say, no, no,

23:23.001 --> 23:26.364
we're all the same. We're in the same business. 
We've got your department. We have ours. Each one

23:30.287 --> 23:31.068
of us has. We have to do one job to get this thing 
going. That's right. So then I said, You'll have to

23:39.607 --> 23:43.652
pardon me because I have so much to do and I got to get 
it done. I said, no, we're going to eat. Oh, no. I

23:48.858 --> 23:49.459
said, yes. I said, we're going to eat. I said, wait a 
minute. Give me about five minutes. Let me go pull

23:53.824 --> 23:54.685
this. He said, okay, okay. I went down there and 
pulled my cover all up, white stuff. Then we went to

24:02.655 --> 24:03.355
eat. They took me to, I don't know what place it was. 
Beautiful place. I mean, I I couldn't hardly sit on

24:09.222 --> 24:11.004
the chairs. I felt so small. But they fed me. And 
they'd talk all day. And I kept saying, I got some

24:18.472 --> 24:23.478
tomorrow. I don't know what they had. I never did 
learn why they called me. They want to talk to me and

24:31.227 --> 24:33.849
all that. But later on, when Mr. Manley came here 
and said that he wanted me to go to and be in his

24:39.833 --> 24:46.039
office on the 31st of October, I didn't go. And then 
two or three weeks later, a ball blittered in my

24:46.059 --> 24:51.804
head. I said, golly, I bet you I missed the biggest 
opportunity of my life there. Well, that wasn't

25:02.554 --> 25:04.315
the first one, anyway. I lost many. They never 
treated you like that around here, though. I

25:10.985 --> 25:17.272
invented apparatus back in 1941, 42. And I

25:17.472 --> 25:33.950
was expecting to find an automobile, waiting for 
an automobile of that model that I invented an

25:17.472 --> 25:33.950
apparatus for to hit the junkyard so I could buy it 
to make it work. And I patented the thing. Well, I

25:35.772 --> 25:38.595
waited and waited three years. And one day, there 
was a thing. I looked at it. Uh-oh. Something going

25:46.441 --> 25:48.784
wrong now. Came to the garage and took my piece. I 
said, Davis, this here, see what I...

25:51.268 --> 25:59.240
How do you copy that? I said, no. I made this three 
years ago to go on this 40 miles here already. And

26:04.929 --> 26:06.411
here you have one already. What are you telling me? 
It just came out. This is a new patent. I said, well,

26:10.789 --> 26:12.971
three years ago I made this thing. But I didn't 
patent it because I wasn't sure if it was going to

26:13.051 --> 26:16.414
work or not. But look. They said, well, you just 
lost about $10,000 plus commission. And I said,

26:24.962 --> 26:28.685
well, that's part of my living. That's all right. I 
don't want to get to race anyway. Live. The car

26:33.550 --> 26:34.350
don't kill me. I'm going to live until I die. That's 
the beginning of it.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.084
Oh, we still have how much? No telling. Well, back 
in the war years, I was called to Bryan to come and

26:46.129 --> 27:02.111
that Bryan,

26:46.129 --> 27:02.111
what was the fourth place name then? Bryan Motor 
Company. By Mr. Elvin Depot. by the way i was

27:06.393 --> 27:32.181
working in huntsville at that time at the cheryl 
lake place and i was called down here fourth place i

27:06.393 --> 27:32.181
came here i said well uh miss depot the only way i 
could move is that see i don't want to go in there or

27:06.393 --> 27:32.181
in the service because i know i'm gonna be put in the 
navy and i don't like to be in there in the boat

27:06.393 --> 27:32.181
because i'm gonna go in there bottom of the boat now 
i don't mind going being on top but being on the

27:32.887 --> 28:01.138
bottom and i know where i'm going because i'm a 
mechanic in the first place and that's where i'm

27:32.887 --> 28:01.138
gonna go now i don't want to be there they say oh 
don't you worry about that if you work with us we'll

27:32.887 --> 28:01.138
we'll see that you don't go good move and i think 
that's when i i said well since i'm not going in the

27:32.887 --> 28:01.138
service i'm gonna build my house i built this house 
by myself. It's made out of concrete blocks that

28:05.145 --> 28:18.740
are 14 inches long, 12 inches high, and 12 inches 
wide. Each block weighs around 70 pounds. Sturdy

28:22.384 --> 28:23.945
place. Yes. I made 1,500 blocks. My foundation is 
seven feet deep down to hard. There's a rock seven

28:37.482 --> 28:45.449
feet deep here that the railroad pick, it'll 
bounce. It won't go through. That's where this

28:46.630 --> 28:51.175
house is sitting on, on that kind of a rock. What 
year did you build your house? I built it in 46.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.863
And built from... Later on, I'll put that top 
corner, that additional thing here. Two or three

29:05.379 --> 29:08.862
years ago, I had that back built. I didn't have time 
to build it. I did all the inside in that one down

29:12.927 --> 29:15.149
there. I just made the whole thing. But I wired 
this. Pretty good electrician. They stand up that

29:22.557 --> 29:26.661
many years, and mine must be pretty good. Sewer 
lines, I never put in my own sewer lines. And I never

29:31.363 --> 29:36.750
had one plug yet for many years. My house, that 
train, that steam engine, when we had the steam

29:36.990 --> 29:49.687
engines here and they're coming through there, 
every time it pumped, this thing would shake. Now

29:51.229 --> 29:54.973
that's how hard, how deep they found it on the 
railroad. But I could feel the engine. And all the

29:56.408 --> 30:05.660
windows were made out of wood and, you know, wood 
frame. And later on, I put this long windows in. But

30:10.065 --> 30:12.068
they would shake. And this house never break. They 
don't have a broken spot where I had to patch and I

30:14.211 --> 30:19.818
like that. I think I built, I wasn't too good of a 
doubler then. I'm a better, a little better now,

30:23.042 --> 30:25.605
but. I think I was about 30 years old then. No, I was 
younger. Well, I'd say around 30 anyway. I said, I

30:36.933 --> 30:38.414
must have a lot of sins. I know men right now that are 
45 and they don't have sins at all yet. I don't know

30:44.940 --> 30:48.523
where I got them from, but I give myself a lot of 
polish. But my son, my son Sammy, when I said,

30:51.005 --> 30:55.609
Sammy, you're going to graduate from high school. 
I want you to go to college. Not that I don't think

31:00.036 --> 31:01.578
you're smart, no. But on top of that, I want you to be 
smarter yet. So he went to college. And he says the

31:07.607 --> 31:11.873
first year he was in college, he learned how smart I 
was. I said, well, good thing I didn't have school.

31:18.062 --> 31:20.145
Otherwise, I don't know what I'd be. Would have 
ruined you probably. Wow, I've been in

31:23.085 --> 31:26.394
penitentiary, yeah, behind bars. I've been, oh, 
probably been...
