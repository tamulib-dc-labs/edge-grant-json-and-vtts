WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:04.493
strictly a poor boy's school then. Describe the 
project houses. Well, the project houses,

00:08.356 --> 00:11.900
incidentally, there was one at A&M. The building 
is still there where the campus security is. That

00:17.565 --> 00:22.350
was built by the American

00:17.565 --> 00:22.350
Eagle. The money for it and everything, and they 
sponsored these boys in that building. The other

00:28.275 --> 00:30.257
project houses started by... mostly by Dan 
Russell, I believe it was.

00:37.059 --> 00:46.431
They took different counties, and there'd be some 
lady that would come from those counties, maybe a

00:37.059 --> 00:46.431
widow lady or somebody like that, and she would be 
the cook. And they'd bring their groceries from

00:47.372 --> 00:57.004
that county into that pocket house, and these boys 
would stay there in that pocket house. Now did the

00:57.558 --> 01:03.906
rest of y'all respect the project house boys? Did 
y'all make fun of them as being poor kids? I

01:09.633 --> 01:20.807
remember one time there was a group that they 
picked up all over the United States and they put in

01:09.633 --> 01:20.807
a dormitory there. I've forgotten the name of the 
dormitory. They brought them in and and put them in

01:26.583 --> 01:28.525
that dormitory. They brought them in from out of 
Texas and everywhere. And that was rumored to be a

01:34.651 --> 01:40.657
pretty rough place. However, as I understand it, 
there were several of them that had lived there

01:40.757 --> 01:52.689
where part of it later became real outstanding 
good people. And I think George McCullough,

01:53.070 --> 01:56.353
George McCullough, who would later be the dean of 
the graduate school. He was one, and Harry Kunkel

02:02.176 --> 02:04.459
was one.

02:08.604 --> 02:26.323
I think that

02:08.604 --> 02:26.323
the one that ended up running that concession 
stand at A&M across from the old high school that I

02:08.604 --> 02:26.323
went to was one of that dudes. They

02:28.463 --> 02:36.954
were right along by the time I graduated from A&M or 
something. I think that's about when they

02:37.675 --> 02:39.176
started.

02:41.820 --> 02:42.280
Let's see. On the campus, what were the major 
buildings? Describe the campus when you were a

02:46.906 --> 02:49.469
student. What was there? Well, as you go on the 
campus, I remember the Mitchell Hall. Did

02:56.780 --> 03:19.914
you go to him with your hernia? No. I don't think 
they'd take care of that. I went up there once

03:25.702 --> 03:28.586
several times. We had to pay, when you're 
registering in, you had to pay some kind of a fee,

03:28.606 --> 03:38.802
but you could go on what's called sick call over 
there. And they had some bids there. I remember

03:42.348 --> 03:48.758
being there one time with the flu.

03:49.058 --> 03:51.801
They had beds there and nurses, of course. There 
used to be a nurse called Mom Clegghorn

03:52.061 --> 04:00.889
that was there. That hospital was right on the 
other side of the President Hall. And going down

04:05.854 --> 04:13.982
the Military Walk on

04:05.854 --> 04:13.982
the left was Mitchell Hall, Legend Hall. YMCA was 
out on the right. remember

04:19.383 --> 04:42.285
a gas ride hall and then there was a hall place on 
further down that

04:19.383 --> 04:42.285
as you go to gun hall it was on the left it was a very uh 
was it was hart hall there yet no it wasn't This hall

04:43.683 --> 04:54.177
was on the left just before you get to God Hall at the 
end of the military

04:43.683 --> 04:54.177
wall. There was an old red brick building there. 
I've seen the pictures. Real nice architecture. I

04:59.384 --> 05:12.441
remember I would go up in there when I was going to 
school and get pigeons out of there and take them

04:59.384 --> 05:12.441
over inside a what

05:13.096 --> 05:40.504
did y'all what happened at gyne hall what did y'all 
do at gyne hall

05:13.096 --> 05:40.504
well gyne hall is where they had the ceremonies as I 
remember

05:13.096 --> 05:40.504
I don't know if that's where I received my diploma 
or not did they show movies in gyne hall

05:43.505 --> 05:57.753
No, there was another hall right next to the old, 
across from the YMCA building was the Hollywood,

05:43.505 --> 05:57.753
or what do you call it, tents? It had the square tent 
where the students stayed also. I was there at that

06:05.695 --> 06:07.959
time. I don't know whether I was at college or in or 
not. And off to the right of that was where they had

06:10.883 --> 06:14.068
the movies. That was just before you get to the 
Presley's

06:16.452 --> 06:21.700
house. Facing west of the wide city building. It 
had two stories. Well, sort of like the Army

06:27.409 --> 06:33.458
houses.

06:34.298 --> 06:42.206
had a balcony around, and I've forgotten how the 
seating was, but the seating was according to

06:34.298 --> 06:42.206
class.

06:46.250 --> 07:02.466
Seniors had the seats that they wanted, and I 
remember going to school, I'd have to slip in

06:46.250 --> 07:02.466
there, and sometimes the Aggies would pick me up 
overhead and take me in. This is when you were in

07:02.817 --> 07:04.279
high school? Well, this is kind of when I was in 
grade school. Oh, oh, grade school. Okay. Oh,

07:09.224 --> 07:10.125
okay. They didn't check the tickets too close.

07:17.073 --> 07:21.658
But we'd have, oh, incidentally, there, too, we'd 
go in this hall. I've forgotten the name of it. It's

07:23.621 --> 07:25.703
kind of where the chapel is now. with the Aggies 
were playing out of town in football, they had a

07:27.725 --> 07:50.826
black board up there, green, and they would, over 
the radio I suppose, and they would mark on that

07:27.725 --> 07:50.826
board how the football team was doing, and they had 
that in the hall. And it had a good attendance. And

07:54.826 --> 08:00.475
let's see, then the academic building was the big 
building, wasn't it? The one with the dome on it.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.501
Right, right. That was the big... The flagpole out 
in front of there is the one I'm talking about that

08:05.262 --> 08:17.801
quite often when Colonel Andy was in combat, 
they'd run up a flag and he'd have to pay somebody to

08:05.262 --> 08:17.801
climb up there and get it down. And then Cushing 
Library...

08:24.323 --> 08:26.045
I don't think it was that. Really?

08:29.248 --> 08:31.831
I don't really remember. Now, where did you take 
most of it? We had the exchange store. When I was

08:37.317 --> 08:43.644
going to school, that right in front of the 
exchange store was the grocery store. On campus?

08:44.445 --> 08:45.646
On campus. And on the other side of the grocery 
store was the electrical shop, the plumbing shop,

08:45.666 --> 08:50.972
and stuff like that. Did the whistle blow at 8 
o'clock, 12 o'clock? Oh, yes. To this day, I still

08:57.683 --> 09:03.972
did that at 8 o'clock, at 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, and 
then at 5. And you could hear people out. You don't

09:06.536 --> 09:12.003
realize how people out in the country at that time 
depended on that whistle. People several miles

09:12.024 --> 09:14.767
away.

09:18.052 --> 09:21.617
Now, the railroad station was a busy place.

09:24.196 --> 09:33.584
Oh,

09:24.196 --> 09:33.584
yeah, that's the first track that the ING and I did 
was. They had a railroad building there, of

09:33.604 --> 09:36.407
course, on the other side of Southern Pacific. And 
the trains run pretty well on schedule, several

09:38.468 --> 09:48.517
times a day, going between Houston and Dallas. And 
I remember we got on one time. was able to go, we went

09:53.710 --> 10:01.023
to, I believe, Baton Rouge at a football game. And 
they let us sleep on the train. And we also, that

10:05.952 --> 10:16.191
time that there was a fight up there at Baylor when 
they suspended up there, I went with my uncle.

10:16.863 --> 10:24.776
Everybody went up on the train and they had a 
baggage car where they'd have soda water and

10:16.863 --> 10:24.776
sandwiches and whatnot. And I would say the entire 
group that went to the game went on trains. Very few

10:33.490 --> 10:35.353
people used a car to go. And we had some indication 
before we went up there of what they were going to

10:35.393 --> 10:42.364
do. And they had been told to please do not do that. 
They were ridiculing the, as I remember, the

10:47.863 --> 10:55.776
farmerettes, or the farm girls. And some old big 
boy, they had a car that went out on the field, and

10:56.457 --> 11:03.509
some old boy went out there and jumped into them. 
And they started, they were doing some repair work

11:03.529 --> 11:08.858
at Baylor Stadium. And they had a bunch of boards 
around there about three feet long, and a bunch of

11:10.171 --> 11:15.717
those. At that time, too, at the football games, 
all the freshmen came over and sat on the

11:16.598 --> 11:25.567
sidelines, freshman football players. So they 
had boards, and they got out in the middle of the

11:25.587 --> 11:36.398
field and they were fighting, and then they played 
the Star-Spangled Banner and a lot of Aggies stood

11:25.587 --> 11:36.398
at attention. And one of them was hit. Hit with a 
board? Yes. Best I remember. I'm sure that's what

11:44.813 --> 11:45.994
it was. Anyway, that boy died. And as I understand 
from later on, Dr. T.O. Walton, a man that I

11:52.382 --> 11:55.466
respected a lot. He was a good man. He had time for 
anybody.

12:00.312 --> 12:01.113
He was a good man. He told me that if they sent 
somebody up there for a period of a maybe three or

12:06.095 --> 12:14.311
four years and paid his way at Baylor, but they 
never really found out who did that. But they

12:15.473 --> 12:18.940
suspended all athletics with for four years I was 
schooled or something like that. Now was this

12:22.913 --> 12:25.436
while you were a student or a little earlier? This 
was earlier. My uncle took me up there by train and

12:26.798 --> 12:38.753
that was, I couldn't have been over maybe 12 or 13 at 
the time. Now when you were a freshman, did you go to

12:39.674 --> 12:45.541
any of the out of town football games? Did you go on a 
court trip? Well, I went to the one over there in

12:48.080 --> 12:52.224
Louisiana that time. Don't remember much about 
it, although we slept on the train. Oh, I went to

12:57.110 --> 13:06.720
Dallas on several occasions, and I knew a girl that 
I had met. This is something else. When I was at,

13:11.105 --> 13:15.910
anyway, this girl I had met was going to SMU And I 
remember my clothes were rather shabby. SMU was a

13:22.668 --> 13:30.099
moneyed school, and I somewhat felt a little bit 
out of place.

13:33.704 --> 13:35.526
But I enjoyed myself. I remember I went on a court 
trip to SMU up there, and that's when two of the

13:36.187 --> 13:45.660
girls from CIA, They were so often, they'd come 
down to A&M and go to these dances and whatnot. And

13:52.678 --> 14:03.291
there was a correspondence way that the girls from 
there would send a letter to the same box number at

13:52.678 --> 14:03.291
A&M. I remember a little bit about that. Did you 
ever have a date with one of those, a blind date with

14:05.113 --> 14:09.358
a CIA girl? No,

14:10.039 --> 14:14.584
I didn't. I took a little money, and somehow or 
another, transportation or something. As a

14:23.408 --> 14:31.777
freshman and sophomore, I didn't have the money to 
go to those dances. When you went to that court trip

14:33.799 --> 14:38.003
in Dallas, you went on the train. Where did you 
spend the night?

14:43.538 --> 14:56.111
I don't really remember whether we spent it on the 
train or

14:43.538 --> 14:56.111
sometimes we'd get a room between a bunch of us 
together, I suppose. I remember something about

14:56.232 --> 14:58.494
that. Did the Aggies party much on court trips? 
Well, we thought we were, but we didn't drink very

15:02.678 --> 15:05.942
much, anything like that. Once in a while they 
would a little bit, but drinking wasn't a problem

15:06.863 --> 15:10.727
back there. During those years, did you ever 
hitchhike? All the time. Describe how an Aggie

15:16.810 --> 15:19.435
hitchhiked in those days. Well, you'd go up there 
more or less to the east, where the East Gate is now,

15:20.517 --> 15:27.591
near Walton Drive. I've seen as many as a hundred or 
two out there. going to Houston as an example.

15:38.349 --> 15:43.796
It seemed like every car that had an empty space 
would stop for us, and of course we took turns. That

15:43.816 --> 15:47.462
is, about when you were there, you had to get back in 
line. And a lot of times at that time, the bunch

15:48.343 --> 15:52.669
would go to Houston. I went down there for a ride 
scheme. And so many of us were there, At that time,

16:02.142 --> 16:10.529
they were hauling cotton down to Houston, 
Galveston, cotton trucks, and they were always

16:02.142 --> 16:10.529
coming back empty with flatbeds. And I've been on 
those flatbeds with those Aggies coming back. I

16:15.305 --> 16:21.511
suppose 40 or 50 on a flatbed, they'd haul us back to 
College Station. Do you remember ever hearing of

16:22.111 --> 16:26.655
an Aggie having a bad hitchhike experience? No. I 
haven't heard of it. Do you remember any

16:29.738 --> 16:33.021
interesting hitchhike experiences, though? 
Funny? Goofy? No, I really don't. I remember

16:38.687 --> 16:41.129
several of them from the Army. I hitchhiked when I 
got out of the Army. at Camp Robert. I was going to

16:47.214 --> 16:50.157
OCS and I hitchhiked back. What about some pranks 
or jokes or good bull that students did when you

16:52.440 --> 17:00.469
were at A&M? Well, I think there was a regular 
session of that they called it, a bull session. I

17:09.322 --> 17:13.168
remember one thing what we would do, they would do 
quite a bit. They'd get some freshman to come in

17:13.189 --> 17:19.159
there, and they'd give him his stripes, you know. 
He was really a gung-ho, and they'd give him his

17:19.199 --> 17:27.973
stripes, but he'd get them sewed on and 
everything, but they'd be upside down. And they

17:29.276 --> 17:33.102
would tell him that was so they'd catch water, hold 
water. And he'd write his folks and tell them about

17:33.082 --> 17:36.888
how he'd been promoted and all that. And, you know, 
they'd come to find out that was just

17:37.028 --> 17:44.461
a joke on him. I remember that. I remember Well, 
like for instance in the little tents across from

17:50.800 --> 18:04.380
Guyon Hall, I mean not Guyon Hall, the YMCA, we had 
wood heaters in there. And we'd get in there once in

18:04.400 --> 18:08.245
a while and sit around.

18:11.670 --> 18:15.576
That was more or less our entertainment because 
The picture shows didn't maybe just one or two

18:16.130 --> 18:22.038
nights a week or something like that. The rest of 
the time you either listened to the radio or study

18:22.779 --> 18:28.928
or sit around with bull sessions.

18:32.052 --> 18:34.275
Did you all ever play any tricks on any teacher? Not 
that I remember. As you

18:39.434 --> 18:50.965
think back, who were the teachers, the advisors 
that really were important in your A&M days? Who

18:53.367 --> 18:55.529
were the people that were real helpful?

18:58.131 --> 19:01.534
I remember S.S. Morgan was very helpful for me. 
There was another teacher in college algebra that

19:02.855 --> 19:08.901
helped me real well, and I remember Mr. Powell. in 
the cotton market in the classes that I took. I

19:15.128 --> 19:24.443
enjoyed that, and I thought he was very able, and I 
enjoyed the classes, got a lot out of it. And this

19:24.463 --> 19:28.510
Morgan was an English teacher, Did you all have a 
nickname for him? Later they would call him Bloody

19:32.256 --> 19:40.250
Morgan because there would be so much red ink on 
your term paper it would be like he had spilled

19:32.256 --> 19:40.250
blood on it. I don't remember that. I remember Mr. 
Snuggs, he'd get out in class when you first came

19:43.075 --> 19:53.653
there and he said, my name is, I believe, Professor 
Snuggs. And he said, I'm married to Mrs. Snuggs,

19:54.595 --> 19:59.960
and we live in our snuggie little home. You ever 
heard that? No. That's good. That's good. I

20:04.905 --> 20:06.466
remember that to this day. All right. What about 
over in agriculture? Were there some important

20:09.329 --> 20:14.594
people and good teachers over there? Well,

20:15.414 --> 20:22.141
I can't recall some of the names. I remember I had 
one. I'll try to think of his name, one teacher in

20:24.363 --> 20:27.727
agronomy.

20:31.372 --> 20:35.958
I can't say that I disliked him, because that 
wouldn't be fair to him. But I took agronomy 105. It

20:38.922 --> 20:46.472
was a five-hour course, and I was also working at 
the time, and I didn't spend the time studying. It

20:48.325 --> 20:51.630
was a very difficult course.

20:52.911 --> 20:59.301
He had a bunch of us in there, and to this day I wish I 
had learned more in that course.

21:03.066 --> 21:05.770
I can't say that I blame him for it. Was Dean Kyle 
still around in those days? Yes. Please describe

21:09.395 --> 21:10.476
him. I haven't had anybody talk about him before. 
What was he like? I always thought he was a little

21:14.742 --> 21:16.645
aloof. He was the Dean of Agriculture, as I 
remember. And there was something there, a little

21:22.792 --> 21:28.318
something about naming Kyle Field. I asked Pinky 
Downs one time about it, and Pinky Downs said he

21:28.338 --> 21:34.263
didn't want to talk about it. So that's about all I 
really know about it. I do know that Dean Kyle's

21:37.326 --> 21:44.353
brother, the best to operate on me for a hernia, 
when I was in my, Between my second sophomore year

21:45.802 --> 21:51.208
and junior year, I went to Houston and had a hernia 
operation. And it was Dean Kyle's brother that did

21:52.189 --> 21:54.311
the surgery? He operated on me at Jefferson Davis 
Hospital down there in Houston.

22:00.037 --> 22:02.400
That was Dean Kyle's brother. What did Dean Kyle 
look like? As I remember, he was kind of a tall,

22:04.622 --> 22:10.629
aloof, just kind of held himself off. Of course, he 
was the dean of agriculture. you realize, too,

22:13.882 --> 22:21.228
that he was the one that would put the final say on 
whether you stayed in school or not. My grades

22:23.910 --> 22:25.111
weren't too good. I was a little between not being 
able to go back and see friends. Now, was Walton the

22:34.600 --> 22:36.361
president then? Who was president?

22:42.626 --> 22:43.467
I don't remember. I knew Dr. Walton really later, 
real well, when he became postmaster at College

22:44.898 --> 22:50.907
Station. Describe his personality.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.483
Well, he had time for anybody. He'd come down and

23:03.186 --> 23:10.737
he had a very good understanding. if someone had a 
problem there, the post office is an example, we'd

23:11.290 --> 23:21.924
call them in his office, sit them down, and talk to 
them. I remember one occasion when the student was

23:21.944 --> 23:34.260
very unhappy, came in there, and Dr. Walton said, 
now young man, he said, I want you to get up and

23:21.944 --> 23:34.260
leave, and when you know how to act, respect me, 
well then you come back. Sure enough, the young man

23:40.980 --> 23:43.663
went back later and apologized to him. That's the 
only time I've ever known him to be a... You were

23:44.124 --> 23:51.872
talking about Dr. Walton. What was he physically? 
Was he big, small? Yeah, he was a pretty good sized

23:57.939 --> 24:00.862
person. Really was. But like I say, he had time to 
talk to each and any individual about various, any

24:04.649 --> 24:13.866
subject. He wasn't, sometimes way back there 
particularly,

24:14.386 --> 24:23.603
some of the professors you didn't feel like 
relaxed with him that it is but dr walton's college

24:24.832 --> 24:45.574
person that you uh he was interested he let 
everybody know that he was interested in what they

24:24.832 --> 24:45.574
had to say and we'll talk to him very much uh mr uh 
cashin describe him He was in charge at YMCA, I

24:47.140 --> 24:51.306
remember. There was a Mr. Gay there, too. Gordon 
Gay. And we used to go there as, when I was in, before

24:56.574 --> 25:07.611
I was in A&M, and we would play checkers and 
dominoes. And they also had ping pong tables.

25:18.106 --> 25:20.109
They were very nice. They treated us okay. 
Sometimes I think you got tired of us kids coming in

25:22.452 --> 25:27.059
there. See, that was a place where the campus kids 
and off-campus kids could associate together in

25:27.519 --> 25:36.452
the old YMCA building. And they had newspapers and 
magazines in there, and go downstairs and maybe

25:36.837 --> 25:47.993
get a

25:36.837 --> 25:47.993
banana split from Casey's. And they had a swimming 
pool there, and kids from Bryan used to come out to

25:48.774 --> 25:55.403
that swimming pool.

25:57.830 --> 26:04.699
Sometimes I think certain days you had to wear a 
bathing suit, but sometimes you didn't have to

25:57.830 --> 26:04.699
wear a bathing suit. And some of the girls from 
around there would use that swimming pool. It was

26:12.690 --> 26:17.797
down in the basement next to where they had the pool 
tables. Did you know either of the Little Cashin'

26:17.817 --> 26:22.524
Boys at that time, Red or Jim?

26:25.528 --> 26:27.651
No, I think

26:29.386 --> 26:35.533
I remember when Red Cashion was quarterbacking 
for A&M a little bit, but not too well.

26:38.656 --> 26:39.017
Let's see. Let's go back to football. Describe 
what you and your buddies, when you were an A&M

26:43.181 --> 26:51.530
student, describe a football home game day. What 
time did y'all start doing things when there was a

26:52.691 --> 26:57.437
home football game? What did you do?

27:02.191 --> 27:05.695
Well, it really, at that time, I did the best I 
could. It wasn't that big an occasion when I was

27:06.416 --> 27:08.739
going to A&M. Did y'all march into the stadium?

27:15.667 --> 27:16.287
I've forgotten. But you did stand up. Oh, yes. And 
if the Aggies won, what did y'all do to the L

27:21.473 --> 27:26.359
leaders? Did you take them to the fish pond? I don't 
remember for sure. When I was going to school, I

27:32.134 --> 27:35.598
really don't remember that. Now, let's see.

27:40.223 --> 27:46.649
Was Coach Bible still here or Homer Norton here 
when you were a student? That was back in 1938. That

27:48.391 --> 27:51.114
would be Coach Norton then. Dick Todd? Would have 
been one of the star players. I remember Dick Todd

27:57.141 --> 28:02.370
was playing when I was going to school. Maybe they 
got him somewhere.

28:07.279 --> 28:09.102
Did the athletes get pampered then? Did the 
athletes have special courses? No. They were just

28:15.103 --> 28:16.305
like everybody else? They were just like 
everybody else. As a matter of fact, they stayed in

28:17.927 --> 28:22.174
the dormitories with all the rest of the students. 
That is, the

28:23.195 --> 28:32.710
professors might have looked at, gave them a 
little bit of special attention, but I don't think

28:23.195 --> 28:32.710
so. They were just mingled in with all the 
students. It wasn't until later on that they

28:37.577 --> 28:40.862
separated them. And were there some notable 
students then? Was there anybody here whose

28:47.423 --> 28:54.113
father was governor or senator or rich person? Not 
that I remember. Give some examples of how

28:58.960 --> 29:03.306
financially tough it was.

29:06.070 --> 29:14.361
Well, as an example, my stepdad came in with either 
a week's salary or a two-week salary and gave me

29:06.070 --> 29:14.361
that.

29:17.966 --> 29:25.255
I don't know whether he had any left over or not for 
me to register for A&M. Did you have any spending

29:25.495 --> 29:28.960
money as the years went along? No. Even when I was 
going to A&M, I didn't get banana splits down at Mr.

29:34.994 --> 29:38.380
Casey's. That was just on occasion.

29:42.406 --> 29:43.488
They were 25 cents. Did you work while you were an 
Aggie? Yes. I had a hard time getting a job at the

29:47.475 --> 29:51.642
time, 25 cents an hour. I

29:53.805 --> 30:00.917
finally did get on with it. landscape department, 
I suppose is what you'd call that, at 25th Street.

30:06.290 --> 30:12.418
We did the mowed grass, did various things around 
on the campus like that. And also, they took care of

30:12.698 --> 30:15.422
the stables. There were some stables there, well, 
more or less where Olsen Field is now. They had some

30:25.616 --> 30:27.358
Army people there. It was a two-story building. 
and I don't know how many people there, and they

30:29.905 --> 30:44.298
took care of the horses for the artillery, and they 
took care of various things, and also they

30:29.905 --> 30:44.298
taught some classes. Oh, I took one of the classes,

30:45.559 --> 30:58.410
signal corps, and that was taught by one of the 
sergeants of that group, but they also had these

30:45.559 --> 30:58.410
stables at the University or the college taking 
care of the horses. And I worked, working in the

31:05.891 --> 31:18.913
stables was the preferred job for it, I was 
concerned, because you got out of the sun and in the

31:05.891 --> 31:18.913
stables, even though you had to do some sweeping 
and you got
