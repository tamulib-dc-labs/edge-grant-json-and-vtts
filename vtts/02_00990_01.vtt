WEBVTT

00:05.650 --> 00:08.893
Worked out. Got an hour's tape? It's an hour and a 
half. 45 minutes each side. What kind of

00:14.438 --> 00:15.980
information do you need? Well, first of all, you 
know, name rank and stuff. I can give you that. My

00:22.045 --> 00:24.848
name is Rod Huddleston. Actually, Rodney. I go by 
Rod.

00:29.372 --> 00:30.373
I was... I served in Vietnam as a sergeant. Do you 
really want my serial number? I've still

00:36.675 --> 00:37.596
remembered it. You still remember your serial 
number? Yes, I do. 20-49-58-4. You never forget

00:42.163 --> 00:43.024
that. Back in those days, we didn't use the Social 
Security number. They gave us a service number.

00:49.813 --> 00:52.577
Actually, they called it a serial number. What 
were your reasons for joining the military? I

00:56.883 --> 01:02.370
joined during the Cuban crisis when President 
Kennedy...

01:03.667 --> 01:08.532
And the going zone in Cuba, we at that time all 
thought we were going to war. It looks very real. I

01:09.614 --> 01:14.940
was in college at the time at California 
Polytechnic, Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I was a

01:15.941 --> 01:17.222
freshman in college. Not doing exceptionally 
well in my grades. I thought that was probably the

01:20.866 --> 01:23.069
lesser of two evils. Besides... If you'd like to, 
we can start a tab if you'd like. No, it's paying

01:29.115 --> 01:31.318
out. All right. But

01:34.683 --> 01:38.849
I joined. That was the reason I joined. Myself and 
several people went down at the same time. In fact,

01:43.415 --> 01:47.741
the induction center in Los Angeles, when we 
joined, was about six blocks long for volunteers.

01:48.362 --> 01:53.069
So I was a volunteer.

01:53.089 --> 01:55.612
And you volunteered in what? That was in 1963. 
Actually,

01:57.635 --> 02:04.605
the Cuban crisis was over by the time I actually 
went in. I had signed up during the Cuban crisis and

02:05.041 --> 02:13.152
then there was a waiting period before they would 
come and, you know, you'd have to get your physical

02:05.041 --> 02:13.152
and pull out the papers and so forth. By the time I 
actually went in was in January of 63 and the Cuban

02:13.192 --> 02:18.760
crisis had passed by that time. Oh, we were still 
excited, but the Navy had already blockaded Cuba.

02:23.186 --> 02:30.076
But I had already joined, so I went into MCRD, 
Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego. I was there

02:31.879 --> 02:32.820
for eight weeks, and then another eight weeks of 
training at Camp Pendleton, ITR, they called it,

02:33.998 --> 02:39.847
Infantry Training Regiment. And then they gave me 
a 15-day leave, and I came back and took advanced

02:41.029 --> 02:49.221
combat training. And while I was in advanced 
combat training, there was some kind of a problem

02:50.463 --> 02:59.938
in the demilitarized zone in Korea along the 38th 
parallel, so they ended our training rather

03:00.239 --> 03:09.131
abruptly and in the middle of the night they took us 
all down to San Diego by truck and bus and every

03:00.239 --> 03:09.131
other conveyance. We got on several large ships 
and we went to sea. And some were in the course of

03:15.119 --> 03:20.126
things. We thought we were going to Korea but we 
ended up debarking in Hawaii. I got off at Hawaii

03:25.494 --> 03:27.276
and waited in what they call a staging battalion, 
which is where they put you when they're waiting to

03:28.167 --> 03:35.700
determine where you go for a few days. I don't 
remember how long. It's been too many years ago.

03:38.505 --> 03:46.660
Then I was assigned to the 1st Marine Brigade at 
Kaneohe Bay on Oahu as part of a replacement group.

03:47.742 --> 03:49.745
And that became my unit. The 1st Marine Brigade had 
as its major infantry arm the 4th Marine Regiment.

03:55.726 --> 04:08.365
It also had, because it was a brigade and it was the 
major strike unit in the Pacific Theater at that

03:55.726 --> 04:08.365
time, for instant response, we had our own 
artillery and armor and air support.

04:11.169 --> 04:17.158
When the Vietnam situation came about, they moved 
us to Okinawa first. And I went to Okinawa with the

04:18.640 --> 04:21.985
4th Marine Regiment. more combat training there, 
and it was some rather different type of training

04:23.095 --> 04:29.462
than we'd ever had before. We all knew that 
something was up, but we didn't really know what

04:29.522 --> 04:33.245
was up. They were very secretive. In fact, most of 
us in those days never heard of Vietnam.

04:40.533 --> 04:44.237
We had barely heard of it in the papers we were 
beginning to more and more. The training routine

04:44.257 --> 04:50.503
was 4 o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock at night. 
A lot of bayonet work, a lot of hand-to-hand

04:51.040 --> 04:57.107
combat, a lot of demolitions, a lot of ambush 
drills. We had counterinsurgency training,

04:58.028 --> 05:00.931
guerrilla warfare training. We finally loaded 
ship off of the capital of Okinawa was Naha, or is

05:03.173 --> 05:10.501
Naha, I should say. We went aboard ships there. We 
went into the South China Sea. And we were afloat

05:15.863 --> 05:20.790
for about three months, waiting for the 
administration to make up its mind. After three

05:21.612 --> 05:26.098
months on a troop ship, you're ready to invade 
anywhere just to get off the ship. Long lines all

05:26.699 --> 05:28.762
day long, standing. They get you up at about 4 
o'clock in the morning, and you stand in line for

05:29.323 --> 05:36.514
hours until you can eat breakfast. And when you get 
out of what they call on a ship a galley, You have a

05:41.480 --> 05:45.644
few minutes to look out to sea, and then they put you 
back in a line again for your midday meal. And then

05:45.724 --> 05:51.871
after your evening meal, it's sleep for a few hours 
and get up again and start the whole thing over.

05:52.211 --> 05:55.074
There wasn't really even room for us to do much 
physical exercise. There were so many troops on

05:55.114 --> 05:57.917
the ship and so much equipment. We were literally 
like sardines. We floated until the decision was

06:00.600 --> 06:08.348
made to apparently land combat troops in Vietnam, 
the 4th Marine Regiment. And the 3rd Marine

06:09.070 --> 06:18.884
Regiment and the 9th Marine Regiment, which were 
the other two regiments compounding the 3rd

06:09.070 --> 06:18.884
Marine Division, were the first combat troops to 
go in to Vietnam. Now, there had been advisors and

06:18.904 --> 06:24.372
some air units that arrived before us. But as far as 
actual combat infantry commands, those three

06:24.933 --> 06:29.419
regiments were the first to go in. The combat team 
that I was with, they took one battalion out of our

06:32.023 --> 06:38.352
regiment leaving the 2nd Battalion and the 3rd 
Battalion. Then they attached another battalion

06:42.669 --> 06:47.938
from the 3rd Marines to us, which was 3rd 
Battalion, 3rd Marines. We went ashore May 7,

06:48.699 --> 07:05.267
1965, a place called Chu Lai, South Vietnam, with 
three infantry battalions, 3rd Battalion, 3rd

06:48.699 --> 07:05.267
Marines, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, 3rd 
Battalion, 4th Marines. We had as our direct

07:05.686 --> 07:13.816
mission to provide security for a airfield that 
was being built by the Seabees. Seabees is

07:13.896 --> 07:17.861
Civilian Construction Battalion of the Navy. We 
were told originally that we would be in this then

07:18.182 --> 07:30.096
Republic of South Vietnam for 10 days, roughly, to 
lend support to the government of South Vietnam to

07:18.182 --> 07:30.096
try to stabilize it. They were having some 
difficulties, which became very obvious later.

07:35.335 --> 07:39.940
We went ashore expecting a combat situation. We 
were fully combat loaded. By that I mean men had

07:42.483 --> 07:45.686
been issued ammunition for their weapons. We had 
grenades. We had prior techniques. We had

07:49.811 --> 07:50.672
explosives. We went ashore expecting a fight. 
They had told us that the beaches we were landing on

07:53.134 --> 07:57.619
would be defended and hostile. That proved not to 
be true. The only South Vietnamese we saw were a

08:00.442 --> 08:04.667
group of young women Six or seven had a large banner 
that said, welcome Marines. There was no shooting

08:10.285 --> 08:12.889
when we went ashore the first day. It was the worst 
thing that we experienced was the heat. We weren't

08:18.518 --> 08:20.682
used to it. Not that the ships had been that much 
more comfortable, but when we landed, we were

08:22.028 --> 08:29.480
carrying our full field transport packs. They had 
given us food, ammunition, other supplies that

08:30.342 --> 08:35.370
would supposedly last us 10 days. And we also had 
gas masks, shelter halves, Flak jackets, which is

08:42.413 --> 08:46.900
what they call... Steel, steel jackets. Yes, 
steel coverable canvas. Actually, it was a Teflon

08:48.904 --> 08:57.277
nylon plate inside a jacket and the little, what 
they call drawers or panties to protect you in that

08:48.904 --> 08:57.277
area. A lot of weight to lug around. When we landed, 
it was 125 degrees in July. Humidity runs around

09:06.653 --> 09:09.197
100% in the tropics. The first day we went ashore, 
we didn't go inland. We just stayed on the beach,

09:13.099 --> 09:21.228
and we got ourselves together, and we helped the 
Navy in landing supplies, bringing support

09:13.099 --> 09:21.228
equipment ashore. The second day, we started 
marching inland. My particular unit, they

09:25.172 --> 09:28.315
divided battalions up into companies. Each 
company was given a mission. We had to secure a hill

09:31.599 --> 09:34.382
west of the airstrip. And I don't recall the name of 
the hill now. It had a number, I think. Marching

09:41.122 --> 09:45.807
inland to the hill was about five miles from the 
beach. We lost our first man that day. He wasn't in

09:49.852 --> 09:51.614
any activity. He died of heat exhaustion. We were 
without water. We landed, each of us carrying two

09:56.720 --> 10:00.304
full canteens, quart size. Most of us drank all of 
our water the first day ashore. They didn't

10:03.748 --> 10:09.154
resupply us with water that night or the next day 
because all the water had to come from the ships.

10:09.809 --> 10:20.628
And all of the Marines and the Seabees and the 
various supporting groups that were in support of

10:09.809 --> 10:20.628
us, there was a lot of men ashore, I think around 
10,000 is the figure I heard. The ships could not

10:20.668 --> 10:30.805
distill enough water and transport enough to all 
the various units to keep up with the demand. Of

10:31.730 --> 10:40.799
course, we were supposed to be on water rations, 
and each man was only supposed to drink so much at a

10:31.730 --> 10:40.799
time, but that was really no problem because for 
the second day, none of us had any water anyway. We

10:41.941 --> 10:49.749
had a kid in my platoon started suffering from heat 
exhaustion, and we tried our best to cool him, but

10:41.941 --> 10:49.749
there was nothing we could do. The helicopters 
from the ships, we called for medevac, but for some

10:49.769 --> 10:57.957
reason, there was a mess up in communications. 
They didn't get there in time. That was all of a

10:59.587 --> 11:09.521
shock to us because we were prepared, I think, in 
our mind for fighting, but we weren't prepared for

10:59.587 --> 11:09.521
seeing people die of heat exhaustion. It was kind 
of a shock, particularly someone that we'd been

11:09.802 --> 11:15.390
with and known for quite some time. After that, 
things got kind of blurry in my mind, and I don't

11:17.373 --> 11:23.802
know from what happened from one day to the next. I 
know we went out to the hills. and we dug in. We

11:27.417 --> 11:29.179
didn't have concertina wire in the beginning. The 
supplies hadn't got on the beach or they couldn't

11:29.219 --> 11:32.184
get them to us. There were not a lot of trucks there 
at that time or jeeps. We had just gone ashore

11:36.791 --> 11:41.098
basically with infantry and very little in the way 
of support. So we just dug holes. We didn't have

11:43.723 --> 11:47.629
sandbags to fill, to make sandbag bunkers. We just 
piled up a parapet of earth around our fighting

11:47.669 --> 11:50.914
holes. For the first few days, Actually, I guess it 
would be the better part of the first week. There

11:56.380 --> 11:58.288
was absolutely no enemy activity. There was a lot 
of shooting at night. It's because we were

12:01.960 --> 12:08.010
nervous, green, inexperienced, not tried combat 
veterans, and we were shooting at shadows. We

12:08.530 --> 12:13.198
didn't know when the enemy would attack, and we 
kept seeing signs of enemy activity. By that, I

12:13.298 --> 12:25.758
mean we sent out patrols every day, and we would see 
evidence of what we thought where the enemy had

12:13.298 --> 12:25.758
been in villages, and villagers were telling us 
that the Viet Cong had been there, but we hadn't

12:13.298 --> 12:25.758
come across them yet. None of us had seen them. We 
found... evidence of campsites. We found places

12:31.291 --> 12:44.634
where it looked like maybe defensive positions 
had been made at one time or another that may or may

12:31.291 --> 12:44.634
not have been Viet Cong, but everything we saw in 
those days we thought was Viet Cong. That's the

12:45.516 --> 12:49.483
nature of inexperienced troops. The first actual 
attack we had was a rather minor thing. It wasn't

12:53.931 --> 12:56.054
really a battle at all. I'm not even sure it could be 
classified as a skirmish. The Gulf Company 2nd

12:58.837 --> 13:07.247
Battalion, 4th Marines was attacked on an outpost 
by small arms. It was a probing attack. There was a

13:10.531 --> 13:12.013
couple of men wounded. I don't think anybody was 
killed at that time. A couple of days later, we had a

13:16.126 --> 13:23.556
patrol that was fired upon, sniper, and one man was 
killed. I remember that. I didn't know him, but we

13:25.418 --> 13:27.160
heard about it. Bit by bit, our contact with the 
enemy started increasing, and it started mainly

13:29.003 --> 13:34.710
in the evening. We started getting very nervous at 
night. When the sun would go down, we had to start

13:36.913 --> 13:46.065
watching for attacks, grenade attacks.

13:47.260 --> 14:14.010
snipers would usually operate best right around 
twilight sunrise or sunset when people were

13:47.260 --> 14:14.010
relaxed getting up to stretch to go to the bathroom 
things like that and we started losing a lot of

13:47.260 --> 14:14.010
people to sniper fire and that they were doing more 
danger to us than we were to them at that time we

13:47.260 --> 14:14.010
weren't very successful at taking out the enemy we 
hadn't learned their how to how to deal with them i

13:47.260 --> 14:14.010
was involved my own personal contact came after 
I'd been ashore for maybe a month. I'd heard and I'd

14:17.658 --> 14:27.052
seen a lot, but I had never fired my weapon

14:17.658 --> 14:27.052
in combat, I guess you'd say, or hostile. I was 
leading a patrol. At that time, I was a corporal. I

14:32.120 --> 14:34.884
was with Fox Company, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines. 
I was given an assignment on one morning to take out

14:35.645 --> 14:40.352
a fire team, which was four men. to go down along the 
coast about a mile to go inland to a village, I don't

14:40.568 --> 14:52.468
remember the name of it, which was about a mile from 
the coast, and then to come back and make it like a

14:52.904 --> 14:56.869
big square and to check this area out. Yeah, it was a 
reconnaissance patrol to see if there was any

14:56.889 --> 15:00.653
activity in that area. We ran patrols constantly, 
and there were different patrols covering

15:00.694 --> 15:05.840
different parts of the map to make sure that 
everything was clear. Again, our major job was to

15:06.320 --> 15:11.427
provide security for the airfield that was being 
built at Chu Lai. And all this time that we had been

15:11.487 --> 15:22.320
there, the CBs were working 24 hours a day, hauling 
dirt, putting in steel mesh parts to build this

15:11.487 --> 15:22.320
runway.

15:24.646 --> 15:28.692
On this patrol that I was speaking of, we went out, 
we were walking along the coast. It was a trail on,

15:28.952 --> 15:33.799
I guess it was like cliffs. You could look down on 
inlets of the water, maybe 100 feet below us. And

15:39.606 --> 15:41.789
there was, I recall, some fishermen. And they had 
little round boats, one-man boats. The boats were

15:45.775 --> 15:50.381
maybe eight foot across, all black. They would 
take a framework of, bamboo and then stretch

15:52.102 --> 16:20.758
canvas or something over it real tight and then tar 
it so that it was it would float and they used these

15:52.102 --> 16:20.758
as one-man fishing boats and they were right in 
this inlet along the coast and we saw these people

15:52.102 --> 16:20.758
down there didn't pay very much attention to them 
all at once we were spread out probably 20 30 meters

15:52.102 --> 16:20.758
between each man it sounded like bees going past my 
head. And then I heard a pop. It was at a distance and

16:26.514 --> 16:28.736
with a surf down below. It didn't sound exactly 
right, but it was a definite pop, pop, pop kind of a

16:28.797 --> 16:32.962
noise. And I guess instinctively, I don't know, we 
all just hit the ground. We threw ourselves to the

16:38.288 --> 16:41.112
ground even before we returned fire. Not very good 
troops, but we were being shot at. First time we'd

16:43.875 --> 16:45.096
been shot at. And we returned fire. We were at that 
time equipped with M14 rifles. which was firing

16:50.641 --> 16:54.788
7.62 millimeter standard NATO round. We, being 
nervous, had all set our rifles with a selector on

16:55.950 --> 17:00.799
full automatic. We all emptied a 20-round 
magazine in just a matter of seconds into those

17:02.021 --> 17:08.312
little boats. I don't know exactly which one of 
them was doing the firing. If all of them were or one

17:12.810 --> 17:15.074
of them was, I'm not sure. I think I saw one person 
with what might have been a carbine, which is a

17:15.676 --> 17:23.633
preferred rifle at that time for the Viet Cong. 
It's a light, small weapon. American-made

17:25.637 --> 17:28.343
carbine, World War II vintage carbine. .30 
caliber. No, not a machine gun. Usually

17:33.753 --> 17:34.935
semi-automatic. It's a lightweight weapon, and 
the Vietnamese loved them. I guess we sold them.

17:41.022 --> 17:43.666
There's War Surfer or something, because they had 
plenty of them. This was before we started seeing a

17:43.686 --> 17:46.149
lot of AK-47s. This was the beginning. Anyway, we 
fired into this group of fishermen, and Kind of

17:52.825 --> 18:03.194
strange at the time, suddenly realized that 
either I or all of us together or some of us had

17:52.825 --> 18:03.194
killed a bunch of people because they were all 
dead, kind of floating in the surf. And we

18:04.496 --> 18:06.217
splintered their boats. We went on the rest of the 
patrol. We called in on a PRC-6 radio we were

18:09.060 --> 18:13.844
carrying what had happened, and they told us to 
continue the patrol, and we did. They sent an H-34

18:14.725 --> 18:17.908
helicopter out and circled over the scene. We saw 
them from a distance. They circled a half a dozen

18:19.770 --> 18:22.512
times around, then they flew back. We finished the 
patrol. We came in. The company commander called

18:24.894 --> 18:27.669
me up, had a bunch of questions. I gave my report.

18:32.093 --> 18:35.356
It was kind of anti-climatic for my first 
experience in combat. That was really all there

18:35.677 --> 18:37.419
was to it. After that, things just kind of 
gradually increased in their tempo. The first

18:42.324 --> 18:46.108
major operation that our battalion was involved 
in was called Starlight. And it was to the south of

18:46.749 --> 18:49.091
Chiuli on a peninsula. We were operating in 
conjunction with the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines,

18:49.652 --> 18:59.282
and our sister battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 4th 
Marines. Most of the infantry companies of all the

19:00.730 --> 19:06.681
battalions were involved, along with some naval 
forces in cooperation offshore. This is supposed

19:07.242 --> 19:09.025
to be the first major battle. The Marines finally 
meet the VFBF. This is the first one that I was

19:11.469 --> 19:16.518
involved with, and I think it was the first one of 
the war, Operation Starlight. And it went wrong

19:17.821 --> 19:20.525
from the beginning. It was supposed to be a hammer 
and anvil attack. By that, I mean that... We were

19:25.942 --> 19:34.193
supposed to have some forces push the enemy forces 
into a stationary ambush and either capture or

19:25.942 --> 19:34.193
annihilate the enemy. By this, we had landed by sea 
one battalion of Marines, 3rd Battalion, 3rd, had

19:35.234 --> 19:46.209
come in and had dug in along the coast to cut off the 
enemy's exit from that direction. Another

19:46.890 --> 19:50.515
battalion went overland by six-by trucks and 
Amtrak's. and they pushed in from the land. My

19:52.666 --> 19:57.272
battalion was dropped in by what we called then 
vertical envelopment by helicopter assault.

19:57.593 --> 19:57.933
Down the rope? Down the rope. Some of the 
helicopters landed. Others we repelled out of

20:00.957 --> 20:02.820
them to get in. The first units repelled. Later, it 
was just get out of the helicopter any way you

20:04.843 --> 20:07.626
could. Unfortunately, the LZ, that stands for 
landing zone, they picked it right in the

20:09.469 --> 20:20.704
headquarters area of the 1st Regiment of the North 
Vietnamese Army, NVA regulars. And they weren't

20:21.022 --> 20:23.145
Viet Cong. They were uniformed professional 
troops equipped with Russian or Soviet-made

20:24.026 --> 20:30.114
weapons. You saw his uniform when he killed him? 
Yeah, we saw plenty of them. When I was coming out of

20:34.861 --> 20:38.966
the helicopter, my particular chopper was coming 
down. I saw across the field a helicopter explode

20:39.207 --> 20:43.212
in the air and bodies falling. Another helicopter 
was laying on the ground burning. We jumped out.

20:48.713 --> 20:53.241
probably eight foot above the ground, jumped into 
mud, landed in a rice paddy. Fire was coming all

20:53.261 --> 20:54.884
over the place. We were caught in what's called 
grazing fire by heavy machine guns. Most of my

20:59.471 --> 21:03.438
platoon was decimated within seconds. Squads 
were completely annihilated. People were just

21:08.542 --> 21:13.571
finding people from every kind of outfit and 
trying to form some kind of resistance. We had fire

21:13.971 --> 21:16.956
coming into us from the back, the front, and both 
sides. We were caught in a criss-cross fire. Two

21:23.267 --> 21:27.875
rifle companies were wiped out in about three 
minutes, something like 400 casualties. We

21:29.998 --> 21:32.102
finally consolidated. groups of us survivors 
behind dikes and started returning fire and

21:33.112 --> 21:41.323
trying to get some type of a fire superiority. 
That's the trick in combat. If you can get fire

21:43.125 --> 21:45.988
superiority, you can overcome an enemy position. 
Most of our radio men have been killed. We couldn't

21:49.453 --> 21:53.038
find any PRC-10 radios, which is a heavy radio. We 
had a few PRC-6s, but they didn't have the range to

21:53.078 --> 21:59.746
reach the other troops that were from the other 
direction. This is a large peninsula. We could not

22:02.221 --> 22:04.103
reach any air units. Most of our forward air 
observers had been killed or their radios

22:05.425 --> 22:09.009
destroyed. We had no artillery that we could not 
reach by radio. We had no artillery support that we

22:13.514 --> 22:15.396
could reach. We didn't have any air support that we 
could reach. So we were totally on our own and cut

22:18.259 --> 22:21.643
off for most of that evening. That evening, only 
darkness saved us. That's the only thing. We

22:25.187 --> 22:26.469
managed to consolidate. We tried to drag our 
wounded in as best we could. had very few corpsmen

22:31.246 --> 22:32.728
left. We had very few officers left. We had very few 
NCOs left. It was just an assemblage of people from

22:36.592 --> 22:43.660
Gulf Company, Hotel Company, Foxtrot Company, 
Echo Company, H&S Company. That's headquarters

22:43.820 --> 22:45.062
and support. Wherever you could find a Marine, we 
were just getting together in groups. Five men

22:50.068 --> 22:53.131
here, half a dozen men there, three men somewhere 
else. We were trying to set up a defensive

22:53.592 --> 22:56.094
perimeter as best we could. The old man, the 
battalion commander, was still alive,

22:57.516 --> 23:00.139
fortunately. His name was Lieutenant Colonel 
J.R. Fisher. We called him Bull Fisher. And he's

23:05.277 --> 23:09.166
probably the person most deserving for saving 
what was left of the battalion. He was a Korean War

23:10.510 --> 23:17.807
and a World War II veteran, and he managed to bring 
some type of organization out of shambles. The

23:18.260 --> 23:26.890
next morning, we were organized to the point that 
we launched a limited offensive to try to get to a

23:18.260 --> 23:26.890
better position, to get out of that area where we 
were. It was an attack launched on our bellies. We

23:30.534 --> 23:34.499
didn't go running and charging on our feet like you 
see in the movies. We went forward by skirmishers,

23:34.619 --> 23:46.393
one man at a time, two men covering one, 
leapfrogging, getting behind trees, moving up

23:34.619 --> 23:46.393
behind bushes, trying to get fields of fire, 
trying to find cover and concealment. we finally

23:46.964 --> 23:49.087
were able to get to some high ground. In the 
meantime, our sister battalion, third

23:50.309 --> 23:55.478
battalion, fourth marines was trying to come to 
our rescue. Aircraft observers had noted by being

23:56.159 --> 24:03.090
able to see what was happening, even though we 
couldn't talk to them, they had given their

23:56.159 --> 24:03.090
reports. Tanks came in, but the tanks were knocked 
out by 57 millimeter anti-tank guns of the North

24:04.412 --> 24:09.580
Vietnamese. It was very limited maneuverability 
for the tanks because of the mud and the rice

24:10.602 --> 24:14.608
paddies. Finally, about midday, phantom deuces 
from carriers offshore came in. That was the first

24:22.238 --> 24:24.702
time that napalm was used in the Vietnam War. They 
dropped, they repeated napalm attacks on the

24:25.324 --> 24:28.669
enemy position. The napalm broke their 
resistance. We attacked on line, formed a

24:31.695 --> 24:36.563
skirmish line, and assaulted behind the napalm. 
We linked up with 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines on the

24:37.285 --> 24:41.952
beach towards evening. We captured 600 and 
something enemy and killed about 1,400. We

24:49.443 --> 24:59.258
consolidated the next two days, cleaning up, 
picking up wounded, burying, and trying to

24:49.443 --> 24:59.258
reorganize what was left of our units. That was my 
first major operation. After that, we considered

25:01.641 --> 25:03.744
that we were veterans. We all suddenly grew up 
overnight. And then from that time on, the

25:06.462 --> 25:10.106
operations just became one after another. You'd 
go out on an operation. And I remember writing home

25:11.768 --> 25:15.673
to my folks that I would be going on another 
operation. And if I came back, I'd write them when I

25:15.693 --> 25:17.896
got back. It got to be where you didn't want to make 
friends anymore because people didn't last that

25:18.757 --> 25:25.064
long. Did you lose most of your men to booby traps 
and that kind of stuff? No, most of the men.

25:31.943 --> 25:34.627
Actually, we lost them to everything. We lost them 
to sickness. We started getting sick about this

25:35.769 --> 25:37.532
time. Malaria, dysentery, fever of unknown 
origins, various kinds, infection. We were

25:44.724 --> 25:47.108
highly susceptible to infections of all kinds. 
You'd fall down in bushes, and you'd get cut by

25:47.128 --> 25:53.479
thorns, and then your arm or your leg would become 
infected. And it was very hard to rid the infection

25:54.134 --> 25:56.697
in that area. And we couldn't stay clean. And all 
this time that I'm speaking of, I had not changed my

25:58.900 --> 26:03.105
utilities from the day I went ashore. We had no 
showers. We were still on water rations. Half a

26:07.371 --> 26:08.913
canteen per day per man. That's a half a quart of 
water in temperatures of 120 plus degrees.

26:17.017 --> 26:18.559
We lost casualties to everything. Couldn't keep 
track of it. We lost casualties to snipers. We lost

26:21.523 --> 26:23.185
casualties to enemy activity. We lost casualties 
to sickness. We lost men to the

26:26.310 --> 26:32.678
torments of war. Some people couldn't take the 
pressure. Maybe I shouldn't say that, but I guess

26:36.323 --> 26:38.546
that's the truth. After a while, the outfit was no 
longer the same outfit that had come from Hawaii.

26:46.700 --> 26:47.522
different group of people. But the ones that came, 
pretty soon you got to know them too. We tried not to

26:52.214 --> 26:56.284
make friends, but if somebody stayed around long 
enough, you'd get friendly with them anyway. The

26:58.951 --> 27:04.084
old timers got to be less and less, but the 
replacements kept coming. There wasn't as many as

27:04.925 --> 27:06.528
there should have been. We always were 
understrength. Companies that were supposed to

27:08.571 --> 27:13.418
be 200 men would operate at about average, I guess, 
75 or 80 men. Battalions that were supposed to be

27:14.099 --> 27:17.925
1,300 would operate at around 600 or 700. But we did 
the job. We kept going. We marched. We kept holding

27:23.574 --> 27:28.502
the position.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.526
A couple of more operations, and I don't remember 
their name. There was one, I do remember one,

27:31.546 --> 27:34.650
called Operation Cooperation. That was kind of a 
joke. It was us, between us, the South Vietnamese,

27:36.653 --> 27:45.126
which they were trying to work in with our units so 
that we could train them in our method of fighting.

27:46.768 --> 27:49.432
But this time, Army troops had landed, United 
States Army. The 25th Division came over, and I

27:49.732 --> 27:56.903
believe at that time that elements of the 1st Air 
Cav Division had already begun to land, too. yeah

27:57.271 --> 28:18.486
well they were their helicopter assault troops 
they're the old now cavalry is out of helicopters

27:57.271 --> 28:18.486
used to be they were on horses but uh i believe those 
two divisions along with the fourth division was

27:57.271 --> 28:18.486
elements of the fourth division were already 
landing we had i recall when the army came in to the

28:19.377 --> 28:20.818
Chu Lai area. I don't remember which units of the 
Army it was. They decided to have a cooperative or

28:23.621 --> 28:36.073
combined operation between Marines, the United 
States Army, and South Vietnamese, or what we

28:23.621 --> 28:36.073
called ARVN forces, Army of the Republic of South 
Vietnam. Operation cooperation was a real big

28:37.514 --> 28:39.776
farce. We spent days and days and days walking 
through the tulies, just getting hot and mesquite

28:40.537 --> 28:48.945
a bit, and never saw hiding the hair of the enemy. 
And after about six or seven days of this, nothing

28:49.060 --> 29:00.116
to say for it but a lot of sore feet and extremely 
tired, we finally did come on a village where we

28:49.060 --> 29:00.116
were fired upon from a distance. Each respective 
service fell back to their own training.

29:09.170 --> 29:12.795
Kind of a beard.

29:12.815 --> 29:13.296
What do you have on top? I'm

29:13.563 --> 29:30.363
fine,

29:13.563 --> 29:30.363
thank you. Anyway, this particular operation, 
each respective service did their own thing. When

29:36.158 --> 29:40.205
we were fired upon, the South Vietnamese 
retreated to the rear as fast as they possibly

29:36.158 --> 29:40.205
could. The Army dug in and started calling for air 
support, and our Marine units attacked, because

29:40.265 --> 29:46.775
that's the way we'd been trained. And naturally, 
when you're on line and you're not supposed to go

29:47.636 --> 29:54.468
forward of the other forces, when we attacked for 
the advance, we were in front of the Army. The South

29:55.710 --> 30:03.482
Vietnamese, not knowing which way the battle was 
going, decided to fire upon the Army, and the Army

29:55.710 --> 30:03.482
attacked in both directions with air and 
artillery. We had an incoming fire on us. Air

30:06.931 --> 30:09.377
strike came in on us then.

30:12.845 --> 30:13.386
One of many. So the Army separate casualties from 
the Army? Oh, yeah. There was a lot of friendly

30:18.920 --> 30:21.525
casualties taken during the war. It was something 
that they don't speak of too much in the history

30:21.586 --> 30:29.482
books, but many, many men were wounded or killed 
because of friendly fire, if you want to use that

30:21.586 --> 30:29.482
term loosely. We were many, many times attacked by 
the United States Air Force. Not blaming them.

30:37.620 --> 30:40.665
They had an awful hard to tell from way up high who's 
who on the ground. But that's just the fortune of

30:40.745 --> 30:43.309
war. We were strafed by the South Vietnamese Air 
Force. We were shelled by our own artillery so many

30:45.973 --> 30:52.724
times that I thought that we had magnets drawing in 
their shells. That just goes along with it. And I

30:55.969 --> 30:57.872
suppose that's probably happened in every war. 
It's nothing new. Anyway, after that, I went ahead

31:00.297 --> 31:06.826
and served a half a tour of duty over there at that 
time. Well, it was really been more than half. I

31:08.308 --> 31:10.190
served about nine months in Vietnam. And I got 
orders, came in, sending me back to Camp Pendleton

31:10.991 --> 31:18.762
for further training.

31:19.805 --> 31:26.034
I thought I was out of it for good, but I spent a total 
of 60 days in Camp Pendleton, and then I was sent

31:19.805 --> 31:26.034
back to Vietnam. And I was sent back to my old 
outfit, same battalion, same regiment. However,

31:30.640 --> 31:32.103
I was sent to a different company. I'd been in F 
Company, or Foxtrot originally, and I was sent

31:32.123 --> 31:37.811
back the second time to Echo Company, or E Company. 
And I preferred going back to my old outfit. I was

31:40.515 --> 31:41.456
glad that happened. That wasn't my plan. That was 
just luck. They happened to be in the area, and I

31:43.639 --> 31:45.762
was... I came back in to the right place at the right 
time. My outfit moved north from Chu Lai. I came

31:51.165 --> 31:51.846
back in. They were still at Chu Lai when I got there. 
But shortly afterwards, we moved up to Marble

31:53.949 --> 32:02.260
Mountain, which is in the area of Da Nang, in the 
Marble Mountain area. But this time, the

32:02.300 --> 32:06.585
operations had been formed into areas of 
operation in Vietnam. We were in the I Corps area,

32:06.926 --> 32:09.529
which was Chu Lai north. And then they had the... 
three core areas of Vietnam that it was divided

32:13.720 --> 32:18.045
into operational areas. I Corps would be the same 
as first core area. And then they had a second and

32:21.209 --> 32:23.331
third core down to the south. I never saw Saigon. I 
never was down in the Mekong River Delta. I was

32:27.896 --> 32:29.097
always north. I was from Chu Lai north and all the 
major areas there. Marble Mountain.

32:36.434 --> 32:38.558
was, like I said, outside of Da Nang. At Da Nang, we 
had a big airfield. We also had a big harbor at Da

32:40.321 --> 32:43.165
Nang for shipping. And the Marble Mountain area 
was to secure that airfield and that harbor. We

32:49.796 --> 32:52.842
were, at that time, caught up in the Vietnamese 
Civil War. Are you running out of tape? Oh, no. It's

32:54.945 --> 32:56.247
going fine. I'm going to get someone to pick you up 
while I was racking it up.

33:05.982 --> 33:07.249
What am I saying? We were at the Marble Mountain 
defending Da Nang. At that time, it's when the

33:13.863 --> 33:20.615
Civil War broke out between the South Vietnamese, 
the Buddhists and the Catholics were fighting

33:13.863 --> 33:20.615
out. We got caught in the middle of that, and my 
outfit was sent to 3rd MAF Headquarters. The

33:24.902 --> 33:39.027
Marine Corps had been divided into a Marine 
amphibious force for this time, and it

33:24.902 --> 33:39.027
represented the 3rd Marine Division, elements of 
the 1st Marine Division, with support groups from

33:24.902 --> 33:39.027
the Marine Air Wing and... various armor and 
artillery units made up the entire 3rd Marine

33:39.445 --> 33:44.450
Amphibious Force. We had at that time about six 
infantry regiments with other supporting units

33:45.972 --> 33:51.759
of Marines. At 3rd MAF headquarters, we were 
attacked by the South Vietnamese. We had orders to

33:57.905 --> 34:02.230
try, since they were our allies, not to fire on 
them. but to fire over their heads as a warning.

34:06.754 --> 34:10.323
When we took six casualties, six men were wounded. 
I think one man was killed when Corsairs attacked

34:10.925 --> 34:15.477
us from the South Vietnamese Air Force. We 
eventually opened up with our weapons, returned

34:15.659 --> 34:23.167
fire, and shot down one plane and damaged another 
one until they pulled off. I guess our outfit got a

34:24.208 --> 34:28.613
bad reputation or something because they pulled 
us out of 3rd MAF after that. We were known to be too

34:28.953 --> 34:33.078
radical or rebellious, shooting at the allies. 
The South Vietnamese complained about us,

34:33.498 --> 34:36.802
shooting down one of their planes. So they sent us 
further north. We went to a place called Dong Ha.

34:43.418 --> 34:44.241
No, I'm wrong. Fubai first. Went to Fubai. Fubai 
had a little dinky airfield. It was really nothing

34:48.135 --> 34:50.423
more than a cleared off dirt patch. At Fubai, uh, We 
were setting up a major camp. We didn't know then

34:56.936 --> 35:03.748
what it was for, but a lot of artillery, armor, 
infantry units were building up there. We made

35:03.828 --> 35:05.571
major defensive positions. Again, there was an 
airfield at Phu Bai. We were also defending the

35:08.095 --> 35:15.248
main artery on the ground, which was Highway 1, 
which ran north-south through South Vietnam. We

35:15.228 --> 35:18.976
had several bridges over rivers that we were 
defending. We sent out outposts, and we even

35:18.996 --> 35:25.288
manned some old French forts for a period of time 
trying to defend the highway. We were involved in

35:25.929 --> 35:32.042
this time Operation Texas, Operation Dodge City, 
Operation J. Operation J was a particularly rough

35:32.763 --> 35:35.168
operation. That involved... mainly the 4th 
Marine Regiment, against

35:38.077 --> 35:47.933
units of the 242nd B Division in the North 
Vietnamese Army, and I don't know which regiments

35:38.077 --> 35:47.933
it was. They did a pretty good job of fighting us. We 
took quite a few casualties there, but we

35:52.741 --> 35:54.884
eventually... This was the same place where a 
French battalion was ambushed when the French was

35:56.086 --> 35:59.491
there. They called it the Street of No Joy. At that 
time, I think my company took about 70 casualties

36:04.739 --> 36:09.104
on that particular operation. It lasted about 
three weeks. We came in pretty weak, pretty hurt.

36:14.910 --> 36:20.116
And they put us into R&R, in-country R&R, which was 
a safe area. They moved us back down to a place north

36:20.597 --> 36:25.482
of Da Nang that was supposed to be secure. We'd been 
there about three days. This was after Operation

36:28.265 --> 36:30.227
J. And we were on a hill. They had showers built 
there for us. Even had a little PX truck that came

36:36.954 --> 36:39.957
around once a week. Then we were attacked there. 
Supposedly there was friendly forces between us

36:45.363 --> 36:49.829
and the enemy, but somehow they got through. It was 
a satchel charge attack, came in in the middle of

36:49.849 --> 36:52.612
the night. And after that was over, we were ready to 
go back to the front, wherever that was. The rear

36:58.118 --> 37:00.261
area wasn't too safe either. After leaving Da Nang 
the second time, we went up and started making our

37:01.591 --> 37:14.392
major moves towards the Rock Pow and Kam Lo, which 
later became known as Khe Sanh. Kam Lo originally

37:14.412 --> 37:25.951
was called Artillery City because we started 
breaking up a lot of big guns, self-propelled

37:14.412 --> 37:25.951
80-inch 155 howitzers, shelling across the DMZ 
into North Vietnam. We were trying at this point to

37:28.270 --> 37:30.175
stop movement down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. And this 
is a point on the trail where we could reach with the

37:30.817 --> 37:34.768
big guns. Every night we would see Huff the Magic 
Dragon, as we called it then. It was a Well,

37:41.905 --> 37:45.952
it wasn't a C-130. It was a C-47 with a Gatling gun 
shooting out the side. You could hear it for miles

37:51.941 --> 37:53.424
away. It kind of made a roaring sound, and you could 
see it look like Star Trek, just a straight red line

37:53.444 --> 38:00.074
with a tracer fire coming down. We got entertained 
by this, and then at night, too, the planes would

38:01.416 --> 38:07.947
come over dropping photographic flares. along 
the Ho Chi Minh Trail, taking pictures. We ran a lot

38:10.943 --> 38:15.367
of patrols, and we had a lot of patrol activity, a 
lot of skirmishes with patrols. It was almost a

38:16.168 --> 38:21.394
daily occurrence that one of our patrols would run 
into an enemy patrol and have a little firefight.

38:24.317 --> 38:27.180
We moved up on Operation Hastings. Things started 
getting really rough. We moved up to the rock pile.

38:35.855 --> 38:40.301
The rock pile was a high area right along the DMZ. It 
was very rough, and it was really nothing more than

38:40.561 --> 38:44.527
a big pile of rocks out of the middle of the jungle. 
It had been secured by the enemy because it made an

38:46.129 --> 38:55.422
excellent observation post, as well as high 
ground always is critical for controlling an area

38:46.129 --> 38:55.422
of real estate. Our job at that time was to, what 
they called a reconnaissance in force, to go in to

39:02.348 --> 39:08.198
see how strong the enemy position was, to probe 
their lines, and to see what kind of resistance we

39:02.348 --> 39:08.198
got. And then they would determine from that how 
much strength would be needed to assault and take

39:08.338 --> 39:13.086
the position. The reconnaissance in force got in 
over its head, as usually happens with

39:13.827 --> 39:21.319
reconnaissance in forces, if that's correct 
grammar. And once again, my company at this time, E

39:22.008 --> 39:30.899
Company, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, we got 
ambushed. We got held down by heavy fire, same

39:30.939 --> 39:34.043
thing as ambush. And we took a lot of casualties. F 
Company pulled us out the next day. We eventually

39:39.410 --> 39:41.172
took the rock pile. We held that. We came back from 
that position. And during the same operation, K

39:45.258 --> 39:51.846
Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, was pretty 
well wiped out. But we did see something kind of

39:54.707 --> 39:57.250
unusual there. The enemy, I don't know which 
division of the North Vietnamese Army it was.

40:02.676 --> 40:04.058
Again, we were fighting NVA. Did you ever run 
across VC? Yes, we did. I haven't mentioned the VC

40:07.342 --> 40:09.084
very much. I don't think very much of them. I 
consider them bandits. That's the way we thought

40:11.927 --> 40:13.389
of them. I don't mind. The NVA troops were troops. 
They were soldiers, as I started to say. In this

40:21.543 --> 40:29.256
particular operation, the NVA was Operation 
Hastings. Operation Hastings was designed to

40:30.979 --> 40:44.040
stop what we then believed to be a major thrust from 
North Vietnamese regulars. Operation Hastings

40:44.847 --> 40:49.513
was one of the battles in the Vietnam War of super 
size. It involved multiple regiments from both

40:49.573 --> 40:53.118
sides. A regiment numbers around 4,000 men. By 
T-O-N-E, our regiments were a little smaller. We

40:59.987 --> 41:11.983
had in this operation the 4th Marines, which is 4th 
Marine Regiment, the 7th Marines, the 3rd

40:59.987 --> 41:11.983
Marines, and some units of the 9th Marines. I think 
only one battalion, though. The 7th Marines was

41:14.513 --> 41:16.437
from the 1st Marine Division. And then, of course, 
there was various artillery and armored units in

41:16.497 --> 41:22.089
support. We were going up against a division of the 
North Vietnamese Army. Their divisions, if I

41:28.342 --> 41:31.729
remember correctly, numbered about five 
infantry regiments. Their T.O. and E. is a little

41:36.561 --> 41:37.783
different than ours. Their battalions and 
company shrinks were somewhat different. I

41:41.086 --> 41:46.312
believe their regimental size was smaller than 
our regimental size, although they had more

41:41.086 --> 41:46.312
regiments to a division.

41:49.756 --> 41:54.181
They

41:49.756 --> 41:54.181
were pretty well equipped. A typical North 
Vietnamese soldier wore a green olive drab

41:54.701 --> 42:00.568
uniform but it was of a thinner material than ours. 
They had tennis shoes for their footwear. They had

42:08.351 --> 42:17.427
a lightweight helmet that was...

42:08.351 --> 42:17.427
Like a pith helmet? More like a pith helmet, yes.

42:24.199 --> 42:24.700
Okay, that's $150 and $1. Not exactly in the style 
of the traditional British pith helmet, but like a

42:26.603 --> 42:30.714
pith helmet. The same type of lightness of weight. 
It was round in shape. Many of them would have a

42:35.989 --> 42:42.807
khaki colored belt with a star on their belt 
buckle. They had most generally equipped with

42:42.922 --> 42:52.238
AK-47 Russian assault rifles, although some were 
made in Czechoslovakia and Poland. A lot of them

42:52.619 --> 42:57.387
were Chinese, too. as heavy weapons, a heavy 
machine gun equivalent in size and firepower to

42:57.569 --> 43:06.647
R-50 caliber. They had an 82 millimeter mortar, 
which could fire R-81 millimeter rounds,

43:07.328 --> 43:17.468
although you can guess R-81s couldn't fire their 
82s. They had 57-millimeter anti-tank guns in

43:17.448 --> 43:20.671
profusion. They never, to my knowledge, utilized 
flamethrowers as we did. They had a lot of knee

43:26.857 --> 43:30.581
mortars, or 60-millimeter mortars. It seems like 
every squad had a knee mortar. They had more of the

43:34.384 --> 43:36.706
light mortars than we did. We had given up our 
combat commands, our infantry companies, after

43:36.787 --> 43:42.452
World War II had taken the light mortar away. And we 
only had heavy mortars in battalion support. We

43:45.595 --> 43:49.705
had the 81, but it was in our headquarters and 
support company for each battalion. Six 81s to a

43:50.367 --> 43:52.071
battalion. They had probably 60 mortars to every 
one of their companies. So they had a close... a

44:01.154 --> 44:03.517
heavy weapon at close in. We had equivalent to 
that. We had an M79 grenade launcher, which was an

44:05.660 --> 44:12.670
anti-personnel weapon, which we had in every 
squad. It wasn't quite as good as the 60 mortar, and

44:13.411 --> 44:18.317
later we brought the 60 mortars into our company. 
We brought them back and changed the TONE and

44:18.338 --> 44:24.546
brought the 60s into every company.

44:26.686 --> 44:43.176
As far as light weapons, again, the AK-47 was 
popular, although they did have a lot of Browning

44:26.686 --> 44:43.176
automatic weapons, BARs, American vintage, .30 
caliber M1 Garands, the M1 rifle of World War II

44:26.686 --> 44:43.176
vintage. They had carbines, which was a favorite 
weapon of theirs, and they had pistols. Officers

44:50.105 --> 44:57.815
normally carried 9mm pistols that were Russian or 
Chinese or Eastern European. They had very little

45:00.298 --> 45:02.221
in the way of air support. We had air superiority 
most of the time. This particular operation was a

45:05.184 --> 45:09.630
clash of major unit size. They had probably... 
Infantry's a majority. They had greater numbers

45:14.997 --> 45:17.299
in men than we did. We had a superiority in 
material. We had more artillery at our beck and

45:20.222 --> 45:22.884
call. We had air strike, air power. We had vast 
superiority. They had no air power whatsoever.

45:29.911 --> 45:38.159
They had their biggest weapon that came into play 
was a 120 millimeter Russian rocket, which was a

45:29.911 --> 45:38.159
pretty lethal weapon, and it was pretty accurate. 
Also very frightening coming in by its sound. I'm

45:41.662 --> 45:47.914
forgetting their RPGs,

45:41.662 --> 45:47.914
rocket-powered grenades. They were pretty 
nasty, too. We didn't have anything like that. We

45:52.724 --> 45:59.838
had 3.5 rocket launchers, and we had the laws to 
light anti-tank weapons, which were

45:52.724 --> 45:59.838
rocket-powered. So... We had weapon 
superiority. We had air superiority. And we could

46:04.962 --> 46:09.967
call on naval strength offshore for, again, 
airstrikes. And we were operating close enough to

46:11.028 --> 46:15.133
the coast that occasionally we could get naval 
gunfire support. We had a good supply of

46:15.733 --> 46:18.636
artillery. Armor was not involved because the 
terrain was not practical for the utilization of

46:18.897 --> 46:23.502
armor. It was a test of infantry, primarily. uh it 
got confusing in the very beginning we went in by

46:29.468 --> 46:52.202
helicopters helicopters landed all over the 
place and we were spread out over a huge area as big

46:29.468 --> 46:52.202
as bryan college station combined and making this 
assault we were right at the edge of the dmz the

46:29.468 --> 46:52.202
first move that the enemy made was to set fire to the 
jungle and the elephant grass which confused us

46:52.587 --> 46:53.829
further. It had the effect of creating an 
effective smoke screen, as well as the fire

46:53.889 --> 47:01.523
blocked our avenues of attack. And it channeled us 
up a river valley, which we could walk in the river

47:02.224 --> 47:08.756
even though fire was falling on us from trees 
overhead. This led to an ambush situation, which

47:09.618 --> 47:15.388
we countered.
