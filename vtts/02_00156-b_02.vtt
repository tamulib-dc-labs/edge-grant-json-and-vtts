WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:24.688
change the cadence right when you were passing the 
reviewing stand and that they would do that just to

00:03.068 --> 00:24.688
mess you up but i know they didn't do that for us 
because we were always close to the bottom on our

00:03.068 --> 00:24.688
marching ability so what about intramurals was 
that highly competitive highly competitive and

00:03.068 --> 00:24.688
uh uh for you know sort of I guess random chance we 
had a lot of high school athletes in my freshman

00:26.592 --> 00:46.727
unit and did very well in intramurals and

00:26.592 --> 00:46.727
after that I'm you know I remember you always You 
always fielded a team even if you were told at 3

00:47.635 --> 01:00.550
o'clock on Tuesday afternoon that you were going 
to go over and pitch horseshoes for the unit or

00:47.635 --> 01:00.550
something. You would dutifully go do it. What was 
your favorite and least favorite intramural

01:03.393 --> 01:07.058
activities?

01:11.082 --> 01:14.166
Well, I don't remember. because of my uh because of 
the many good athletes in our freshman unit I

01:14.635 --> 01:43.950
didn't get to participate on a lot of the you know 
more glamorous the flag football or the

01:14.635 --> 01:43.950
basketball or things like that um so I'm trying to 
think of some of the things that I did um

01:14.635 --> 01:43.950
uh I remember being, representing our unit in 
tennis and maybe some

01:45.415 --> 02:00.053
of the minor things. There was bowling. You know, 
there were a lot of things that, but I don't

02:01.495 --> 02:12.088
remember that I was particularly

02:01.495 --> 02:12.088
good enough to do any of those things. Were there 
any intramural sports that were very new to you?

02:19.925 --> 02:21.387
Like they didn't do rugby, did they? No. And 
lacrosse. No, none of those things. I think that

02:25.994 --> 02:39.132
pretty much everything that we did was something 
that

02:25.994 --> 02:39.132
didn't seem like a rare or unusual sport. You said 
you were an RV. Describe how the process, as far as

02:40.610 --> 02:47.321
you understand it, how a person became a RV 
selectee. Well, in those days you had to apply. And

02:51.488 --> 02:56.416
that started in your sophomore year. And you, they 
would go through the, then you had to interview and

03:05.167 --> 03:24.897
you had to

03:05.167 --> 03:24.897
you know get yourself all polished and shined up 
you know and on your best military bearing and

03:05.167 --> 03:24.897
everything and they would interview you and then 
they

03:26.480 --> 03:31.766
forgotten whether we got a letter or whether we 
just we got a list sort of. Do you remember anything

03:31.986 --> 03:34.448
about the interview? What was the topic? What were 
the topics of the? I don't remember anything

03:38.012 --> 03:40.254
about. Were these all RV members doing the 
interviewing or were there some core advisors?

03:47.682 --> 03:55.170
There was probably a core advisor present but all 
of the questioning was done by the membership

03:55.437 --> 04:13.297
committee and so you could get in, it

03:55.437 --> 04:13.297
seems like there were two stages that you could get 
into the RVs, but I may be remembering, that's

03:55.437 --> 04:13.297
probably Alpha Zeta. You could get in as a 
sophomore or as a junior. So in the RVs, at the end of

04:16.501 --> 04:21.066
your sophomore year, you either were in or out. Do 
you have any idea how many were selected, how many

04:21.086 --> 04:24.870
new members each year?

04:27.635 --> 04:42.412
I have the impression that there were about 100

04:27.635 --> 04:42.412
or 120 in the unit or something like that and half of 
them had to be new each year. As far as you're aware,

04:42.472 --> 04:47.398
then and now, was the selection fair?

04:53.846 --> 04:57.490
I really don't remember anybody that applied and 
didn't make it. in those days. But

05:00.655 --> 05:14.483
it was pretty well known that you had, I don't 
remember what it was, but there was a minimum GPA

05:00.655 --> 05:14.483
and there were you had to have something, some kind 
of leadership activity, and you had to have done

05:15.357 --> 05:44.183
something in the Corps, and

05:15.357 --> 05:44.183
the reason that I chose to do it was sort of personal 
discipline, not so much, you know, I didn't want to

05:15.357 --> 05:44.183
go to New Orleans and march in whatever parade that 
was, than run amok on Bourbon Street, which some of

05:44.737 --> 05:50.765
the guys, you know, that's really what they wanted 
to do. But I thought that it was about the highest

05:50.866 --> 06:01.540
challenge as far as drill and ceremonies here. And 
I thought I was not good in drill and ceremonies or

06:02.261 --> 06:06.948
marching or anything. And I needed to be better at 
that. And so that's the reason. Was there any kind

06:10.573 --> 06:13.377
of formal initiation Yes, they had an initiation 
banquet and we had to show up in our white suits. Did

06:23.254 --> 06:24.336
you have to buy those? Yes. Well, I think so. At 
least part of it, we may have.

06:34.552 --> 06:39.859
We certainly had to buy the hats and things like 
that. And the uniform then is exactly the same

06:39.879 --> 06:47.528
uniform, isn't it, in design and color? I think so. 
It was a white uniform and wore black shoes.

06:55.798 --> 07:00.424
What were some of the important events that you 
participated in as an RV? Well, I had some kind of a

07:01.484 --> 07:07.811
conflict with the New Orleans trip and I didn't 
make that. But we did go to San Antonio to the Battle

07:07.912 --> 07:14.920
of the Flowers and marched there. And then I was not 
active as a senior. Most of the juniors that came in

07:20.426 --> 07:26.253
every year did not stay on as seniors. So if you 
weren't an officer, it was, it was optional and to,

07:31.927 --> 07:38.339
you know, whether or not you were gonna be active as 
a senior, so. So did you march in the inaugural

07:38.700 --> 07:41.104
parade?

07:45.112 --> 07:49.159
No, I don't remember there being an inauguration 
while I was. And were there any important visitors

07:49.831 --> 07:54.676
to the campus that you remember being a? No. A guard 
for them? No, I don't. I remember that we, that the

07:58.339 --> 08:06.527
RVs had something to do at Mother's Day or, and 
probably at final review. But I know on Mother's

08:06.607 --> 08:10.010
Day we had to put on a drill. And I remember that. 
Did,

08:11.592 --> 08:17.037
what'd you do with your uniform when, Did you keep 
it, sell it, give it away? I don't remember. I don't

08:21.700 --> 08:24.423
think. I may have some of the epaulets or other 
additions to that uniform, but I don't have the

08:25.344 --> 08:36.216
uniform. And I don't remember what I did with it. 
Were you aware as a student that there were any

08:38.839 --> 08:42.703
secret fraternities here? There was a rumor that 
there were some and I think that during my student

08:44.793 --> 08:53.887
years there was a scandal and some people were 
dismissed. I never did understand much about

08:54.989 --> 08:57.953
that. I didn't really know anything about it 
beforehand and was sort of appalled when it all

08:58.534 --> 09:11.053
came out.

09:11.692 --> 09:14.556
The details never did really come out. I mean, it 
would be things in the battalion that so many

09:14.616 --> 09:21.825
students were put on probation or dismissed or 
something. Did you and your buddies read the PAT

09:22.145 --> 09:24.949
during that era? Yes, I think so. Did you all give 
high credibility to the battalion?

09:38.641 --> 09:44.470
I don't remember that ever being discussed very 
much. I think the battalion was probably always

09:44.490 --> 09:50.460
struggling. Student newspapers were always 
struggling to be as straightforward as the

09:50.600 --> 10:05.003
editors wanted to be, and the administration was 
always trying to suppress them, and at least that

09:50.600 --> 10:05.003
was there. their arguments. How often did your 
special lady come to visit the campus?

10:20.968 --> 10:28.037
I cannot remember her coming down here over once or 
twice and she, And then the one year she met me in

10:29.350 --> 10:35.696
Austin and went to the football game there. But

10:35.716 --> 10:48.088
she was, her background was about the same as mine 
and so it was not, it's not particularly easy for

10:35.716 --> 10:48.088
her to travel. I

10:48.608 --> 10:55.575
guess she came down my sophomore year for a 
football game here. And where would she have

10:55.855 --> 10:57.957
stayed? She stayed with some people that I had met 
at the Central Baptist Church. And I kind of forgot

11:07.464 --> 11:09.608
that. But that's right. I went there some and had 
met some people and she stayed with them. And there

11:20.163 --> 11:26.492
were some faculty families that lived over,

11:28.328 --> 11:32.113
south of Guyon Hall, weren't there still? Yes. And 
students, guests stayed with them sometimes,

11:32.874 --> 11:36.519
didn't they? Yes. Did you go to the boot dance and 
things like that? I didn't do that, and when I

11:45.312 --> 11:54.184
graduated,

11:57.067 --> 12:24.357
we were planning to get married and we were 
focusing mostly on uh finishing up here and

11:57.067 --> 12:24.357
getting away so she didn't come down let's let's 
back up uh your junior year uh you bought some

11:57.067 --> 12:24.357
senior boots i presume yes from whom and how much do 
you remember well i bought them from somebody in

11:57.067 --> 12:24.357
the unit and

12:24.674 --> 12:34.206
mostly based on their appearance and not on the 
fact that they fit me. I remember they were about

12:34.306 --> 12:39.713
two sizes too big or something like that, but they 
were okay. And I don't remember much about what the

12:40.634 --> 12:53.871
price was, but it seems like, you know, that it was 
around $100 or maybe a little more than that. You

12:54.138 --> 12:56.720
were spending money on that. You still had the 41 
Chevy. Yes, at that time, yes. You went to the movie

13:01.325 --> 13:04.488
occasionally and you ate out occasionally. Any 
other personal expenses where you spent money for

13:04.588 --> 13:11.254
a good time?

13:17.600 --> 13:18.941
I can't really remember. We, you know, we would do 
things like,

13:24.412 --> 13:30.162
Play basketball or play tennis or something like 
that as recreation. On campus. On campus. Uh-huh.

13:34.349 --> 13:46.369
What were the student indulgences of the, what 
were people smoking?

13:47.092 --> 13:57.595
If you're talking about drugs, I never heard of 
anyone using any kind of drugs during that time.

13:57.615 --> 13:59.599
Had you even heard the words? I don't remember ever 
hearing anyone that said, you know, they even knew

14:01.013 --> 14:09.762
someone that did it. I don't remember ever hearing 
it discussed.

14:14.667 --> 14:20.092
The indulgences, I guess, the only one that I knew 
about was alcohol. And people drank, was it beer or

14:20.893 --> 14:25.738
whiskey where they were drinking much? I don't I 
guess it was I don't guess I really know but you know

14:28.047 --> 14:55.084
this county was dry and so people people that drank

14:28.047 --> 14:55.084
would maybe go out across the river into Burleson 
County and get something and bring it back and show

14:28.047 --> 14:55.084
up at the dorm at two o'clock in the morning roaring 
drunk and throwing coke bottles down the hall and

14:55.655 --> 14:58.739
this sort of thing. But that's, that was a minor, 
that was a very obvious minority of the student

14:59.740 --> 15:08.229
body. And the smokers were smoking cigarettes. 
Yeah, and a lot of people would smoke cigars on, a

15:18.301 --> 15:26.290
Yale practice night so they could blow the smoke in 
some poor freshman's face and not smoke any other

15:18.301 --> 15:26.290
time. And I don't remember, you know, I don't 
remember many people smoking, but I guess there

15:27.051 --> 15:35.782
were a lot. And did any of them smoke pipes? A few, 
yeah. Did people smoke in the dorms? Yes. Because

15:46.539 --> 15:48.541
there wasn't any rule against it, were there? Not 
that I know of. Telephones. If you needed to make a

15:52.064 --> 15:57.049
telephone call, where was the telephone 
available to a dorm student? Usually there was a

15:58.750 --> 16:02.934
pay phone in the lounge. And, of course, they 
required cash. They were not, you know, there was

16:07.058 --> 16:14.785
no such thing as a credit card operated phone in 
those days. and people didn't have enough

16:15.490 --> 16:18.210
quarters. you know to make a long distance call 
usually so they would go over to the MSC and there

16:18.730 --> 16:45.987
was this room that I described a minute ago that was 
um well if you go down the steps past the

16:18.730 --> 16:45.987
registration desk for the room registration area 
there it was just on the left there and I guess it

16:18.730 --> 16:45.987
it's had several uses since that time and there was 
an operator there and a bunch of phones and you

16:46.523 --> 16:52.509
could pay cash there and make a phone call. You'd go 
up after you finished your call and she would tell

16:52.529 --> 16:58.054
you what your charges were. And then your senior 
ring, do you remember what it cost?

17:05.361 --> 17:06.101
No, I don't.

17:08.824 --> 17:10.986
I remember that it was subsidized.

17:13.168 --> 17:15.450
It may have been less than $50 though. And how did 
you feel when you put that ring on? Well, that was a

17:21.385 --> 17:25.255
great feeling, you know. I don't, I don't, I don't 
remember feeling like I would never get it, you

17:29.234 --> 17:35.880
know, but I just was very happy to have it. And 
everybody that I knew, you know, smiled at me and

17:36.761 --> 17:53.776
said, you know, that your right hand has suddenly 
gotten to where you can't keep it anywhere except

17:36.761 --> 17:53.776
more or less straight out in front of you. And the 
ring was far more personally important than the

18:00.183 --> 18:03.428
boots, wasn't it? Yes. Yes. And it was more 
important than the diploma, you know. I mean, it

18:12.182 --> 18:18.271
was the thing that people would see when you'd be 
anywhere else. And it was the thing that was going

18:18.412 --> 18:24.642
to be a symbol of recognition the rest of your life. 
Do you have any good ring stories to share? where

18:28.617 --> 18:32.301
somebody saw one, saw it a zillion miles away? Oh, 
all over the world, you know. I mean, I've had

18:35.144 --> 18:54.186
people come up to me on an airplane in Europe, you 
know, and say, I saw your ring and,

18:35.144 --> 18:54.186
you know, in Japan and in Brazil. just in the most 
unlikely places that I've ever been an Aggie will

18:54.858 --> 19:18.520
turn up and say I saw your ring and you then suddenly 
realize that he has one on too the airplane in

18:54.858 --> 19:18.520
Europe the two people that had on Aggie rings were 
coeds after the time that women were here and women

19:18.685 --> 19:36.441
were graduating and wearing rings and we were 
flying from England someplace and there were two

19:18.685 --> 19:36.441
young women wearing Aggie rings that saw mine and 
whipped out. So that was a pretty amazing

19:36.461 --> 19:40.125
experience. Have you ever lost yours? No. Okay, so 
you don't have a story there. No. Let's see, then as

19:47.457 --> 20:04.183
you're getting ready for commencement, you still 
think you're going to be a professional in

19:47.457 --> 20:04.183
ranching, in agriculture. And you got your 
commission and you think you're going to get

20:04.543 --> 20:09.511
called to active duty, is that right? Yes. But the 
Korean War is over. Right. How did you and your

20:12.155 --> 20:15.861
buddies feel about the fact that the war was over? 
Well I know that everybody was glad because it had

20:18.254 --> 20:40.633
it had stalemated no one thought we were going to 
settle it militarily and so the longer it lasted

20:18.254 --> 20:40.633
the more useless deaths were going to occur and so 
everybody was glad that it was over And it really

20:41.609 --> 20:54.462
had an impact on the Army because the Army was 
funneling these second lieutenants through and

20:41.609 --> 20:54.462
sending them to Korea and they were, you know, they 
were not lasting very long over there in combat.

20:55.483 --> 21:08.477
And all of a sudden there was no need for this cannon 
fodder so they had to cut back on, they had to change

20:55.483 --> 21:08.477
the way they handled the ROTC graduates. they 
didn't have places to put all these second

21:09.166 --> 21:15.133
lieutenants in the peacetime army now. So that was 
the reason that I was, my orders were changed and I

21:15.153 --> 21:34.037
went in for six months training and I had worked for 
the soil conservation service for a while after I

21:15.153 --> 21:34.037
graduated and decided I didn't want to do that any 
longer. And so that's when I decided that I was

21:34.678 --> 21:38.262
going to go to graduate school. And I came back here 
to A&M still not sure what I was going to do. My,

21:44.463 --> 22:08.248
one of my college roommates and I had been on active 
duty for training at the same time and we were

21:44.463 --> 22:08.248
talking about geology and changing our majors, 
you know, and starting all over and he actually

21:44.463 --> 22:08.248
started down that trail and didn't finish. And I 
decided that I was going to go into research. So

22:12.355 --> 22:16.759
that's how I actually came to meet Wayne Hall. 
Yeah, we want to get to that in a minute. Yeah. So I

22:21.363 --> 22:31.952
started back to A&M exactly one year and one summer 
semester after I graduated. I was back here on

22:32.332 --> 22:37.577
campus enrolled in graduate school. working in 
range management

22:38.418 --> 22:48.507
with my major professor's name was Robert Darrow. 
D-A-R-R-O-W? D-A-R-R-O-W, yes. And Wayne

22:55.073 --> 23:04.522
McCully was one of his PhD students, and he was sort 
of my day-to-day advisor. And so we started back

23:05.282 --> 23:08.205
here. By that, I'd been married a little over a year 
at that time. My wife went to work for the City

23:13.640 --> 23:20.409
National Bank within two weeks of when we arrived 
here. And so that was the beginning of my graduate

23:21.391 --> 23:26.577
experience. Let's back up and do some of the senior 
traditions. Final review, did you go through

23:31.504 --> 23:33.567
final review? Yes. What did it feel like?

23:38.797 --> 24:00.062
it as a junior it's a great experience you know 
because you're you know you just almost feel like

23:38.797 --> 24:00.062
you could change your clothes in the front of the 
whole world just to get to wear those boots you know

23:38.797 --> 24:00.062
and I remember running off to find a dorm someplace 
to change and put on my boots and everything and and

24:00.818 --> 24:23.350
uh I was company commander and so you know that was 
the first time I was going to be out in front of the

24:00.818 --> 24:23.350
company and lead them past through using Stan and 
everything we practiced that some ahead of time

24:00.818 --> 24:23.350
and uh so that was that was a good experience uh I 
think My wife-to-be was present for that final

24:23.836 --> 24:27.541
review. This your junior year? Junior year. Yeah. 
Yeah. And then my senior year, you know, everybody

24:32.207 --> 24:45.966
said, well, it'll be, you just won't be able to 
stand it, you know, you'll be so sad and

24:32.207 --> 24:45.966
everything. Well, I was ready to graduate, you 
know. I mean, being a student had been a lot of fun

24:49.071 --> 24:53.016
and being in the Corps, in the end was fun. You know, 
I didn't have a lot of fun my freshman and sophomore

24:56.033 --> 25:01.779
year, but I didn't come, you know, to have fun. I 
came to survive and to graduate. And so, but I was

25:05.883 --> 25:11.148
ready to go on with my life at that point. And I was 
not all teary-eyed about, you know, not going to be

25:11.469 --> 25:20.438
here for bonfire next year and all that sort of 
stuff. Alright, then commencement, where was

25:20.907 --> 25:25.712
commencement held your senior year? G. Raleigh or 
Guyon, or do you remember? Well, it had to be G.

25:31.959 --> 25:34.441
Raleigh. And did family come? I don't,

25:39.587 --> 25:45.073
I don't believe they did. I don't remember now. But 
every name was called, every handshake. Yes. As

25:51.164 --> 25:58.656
you were getting ready to leave the campus then, 
how well prepared did you feel A&M had made you?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.285
What did you think you had learned?

26:07.410 --> 26:09.373
Well, I had mixed feelings. I

26:10.214 --> 26:17.526
guess that I didn't have any reservations about my 
ability to do the you know whatever jobs that I

26:17.894 --> 26:30.132
might get

26:31.242 --> 26:37.451
I was not at that point very confident that I was 
prepared to do what I wanted to do. I wasn't sure I'd

26:37.551 --> 26:40.976
made the right decisions about my future. And so I 
was still very much in doubt as to whether, you

26:41.918 --> 26:59.443
know, I wanted to go ahead and use my BS degree and 
rely on it for the rest of my life. And that was then

27:00.959 --> 27:12.471
borne out in my first work experience where I saw 
what I thought was a very limited opportunity for

27:00.959 --> 27:12.471
advancement. And I felt that just chilling that, 
you know, that you could spend the rest of your life

27:13.152 --> 27:26.986
doing something that approached sort of 
technical clerk and never advance any or very

27:13.152 --> 27:26.986
little. And you had done well academically. 
Overall head drill. Yes. And but this was a

27:32.498 --> 27:59.687
government bureaucracy and I just found that that

27:32.498 --> 27:59.687
mentality of that group was that they put you in a 
job more or less equivalent to a low level school

27:32.498 --> 27:59.687
teacher and that you'd be there the rest of your 
life and that you'd get a few little grade changes

27:32.498 --> 27:59.687
and that you'd be happy to, you know, to have them. 
You come back then a year, a little more than a year

28:03.051 --> 28:08.357
later, and you start out in what program? Well, it 
was in the same department that I had graduated

28:09.138 --> 28:12.902
from. And how did you get over to associate with 
this man named Wayne Hall? Well, Robert Darrow was

28:18.068 --> 28:23.635
an interesting fellow. He had come to A&M from the 
University of Arizona and he had the reason that

28:30.059 --> 28:55.695
the story was that he had been involved in a 
competition for the selection of a new president

28:30.059 --> 28:55.695
and so he had supported one guy and the other guy had 
been selected and so then he decided that he was

28:30.059 --> 28:55.695
going to leave there and come to A&M and So he worked 
in the area of

28:56.823 --> 29:08.278
what the ranchers called brush control, killing 
woody plants with chemicals. And so he stressed

29:09.279 --> 29:20.573
that people that worked in this area needed to have 
a good background in plant physiology. So he

29:20.634 --> 29:23.337
wanted me to go over and take Wayne Hall's plant 
physiology courses and there was several of them

29:23.317 --> 29:37.358
that Wayne taught and I was very captivated with 
that. He'd been here a couple years? Darryl had no

29:41.272 --> 30:10.772
no no Wayne Hall had been here only six or seven 
years at that time he'd come in very late 40s or

29:41.272 --> 30:10.772
early 50s something like that so this is 56 and he's

29:41.272 --> 30:10.772
you know very active very outgoing type of person 
he's obviously

30:11.765 --> 30:13.587
successful professionally. Were you and other 
students aware of his

30:13.767 --> 30:24.718
status, of his credibility as a scholar when you 
took those courses?

30:29.662 --> 30:31.144
Well the first course, no. But the second course 
was on plant hormones and growth regulators and he

30:31.865 --> 30:39.612
brought some of his research into those courses 
and

30:40.098 --> 31:07.050
that was of interest to me and he had several 
graduate students and I got to know all of them as a

30:40.098 --> 31:07.050
TA and

30:40.098 --> 31:07.050
pretty soon I was pretty much aware of his 
scientific status and everything. Make believe

31:13.753 --> 31:16.759
that I didn't know him at all. Describe his 
personality and his manner of teaching. Well, his

31:22.429 --> 31:24.533
nickname was Machine.
