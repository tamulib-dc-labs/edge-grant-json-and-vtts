WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:11.306
I think if I did anything as far as the staff is 
concerned, I delegated much more.

00:14.113 --> 00:16.318
Frank was not about to delegate anything. Yeah, 
and I don't think that was peculiar to his

00:17.243 --> 00:23.713
experience at A&M. I think he operated the same way 
in Texas. I know in Texas he went through sales

00:28.301 --> 00:38.998
managers like a change in socks, and that was 
partly because there was always, you know, Yeah,

00:40.447 --> 00:42.310
Don Collins is there. When you arrived, or about 
the same, he arrived about the same time. He must

00:45.015 --> 00:45.956
have been ahead of me. They were all there when I 
arrived. Yeah, Naylor and Norm and Don. But I

00:50.203 --> 00:52.347
didn't know if you'd actually gotten to see them. 
Oh, yes. And Ray Gamaya. Gamaya, yeah, was there.

00:55.993 --> 00:56.234
Yes. They were all there. The only person that I 
hired of the... Latin group was first was MaryLynn

01:02.401 --> 01:14.476
Dixon, and the other was Jim Billingsley when 
Vermila died. Yeah. I just interviewed

01:16.038 --> 01:17.800
Billingsley. Is that right? He was coming to town. 
I was going to go to him, but... In Knoxville, yeah.

01:23.407 --> 01:26.811
But he was coming in and called me just by chance, 
said, I'm coming to town. I said, well, you're just

01:27.151 --> 01:29.314
in time. I've been thinking about you. He left very 
embittered, crusty. He came there crusty and

01:36.339 --> 01:39.143
embittered. I liked it. He and I got along real 
well. I had him do some book designs for me. I was

01:45.693 --> 01:47.736
going to say, what on earth was he doing back there? 
I can't imagine. I don't know. He came to see his

01:48.757 --> 01:50.620
neighbors, I think. He didn't even want to go to the 
press. I told him he was coming. The lady who took

01:57.009 --> 01:59.152
his place. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, the one that 
worked for Caleb. Not Susan. No, not the other one.

02:04.771 --> 02:06.412
Anyway, Linda? Anyway, she kind of apparently 
corralled him and did get him to come up, and I'm

02:06.752 --> 02:11.636
glad they did. He should be there. And visit 
around.

02:17.401 --> 02:18.803
And their car had broken down. So you're... Those 
were the only two people that I replaced from the

02:18.823 --> 02:26.289
original staff. Okay. And now... One thing that 
really struck me interesting is that almost from

02:30.286 --> 02:35.193
the time he arrived, Wardlaw was talking 
retirement. Yes, that was part of the theory. That

02:37.096 --> 02:38.238
really startled me, yeah. Oh, no, that was part of 
the deal, Henry. He was expecting to retire all the

02:41.423 --> 02:44.127
time. And I cannot remember whether there was 
health problems involved. Well, he had

02:49.956 --> 02:51.077
constantly. Oh, he lived stuff. He always had 
something wrong. Yeah. something natural or

02:58.012 --> 03:03.901
something he invoked by going to Mexico or 
wherever it was. I remember he came back from one

03:03.921 --> 03:05.724
Mexico trip. Oh yeah, well he got Montezuma's 
revenge in a big way on one of those. He traveled

03:11.453 --> 03:16.461
around with August Frugge and Chester Kerr. They 
were on a committee for the National Association,

03:19.561 --> 03:23.345
and they went and established outlets. They went 
to South America at least twice, once to just

03:23.365 --> 03:28.330
Central America and South America. Once they went 
all over South America trying to arrange

03:28.350 --> 03:49.230
distribution because, you know, the tariff 
businesses in Brazil and all of it were just

03:28.350 --> 03:49.230
terrible, and they were trying to get some, they 
were trying to find a central distributor, and

03:28.350 --> 03:49.230
they ended up working out of Mexico. lasted for a 
while. But they also went to Mexico two or three

03:52.258 --> 03:56.343
times. Of course, he liked that. Yeah, yeah. And 
they, the other two,

03:59.207 --> 04:08.580
all three of them had big lists of South American 
stuff. California, Texas, and Yale. All three had

04:12.845 --> 04:16.991
big, that's how they got on that committee. But 
they also were longtime So, Wardlaw,

04:19.636 --> 04:25.829
let's get to Wardlaw's retirement. I guess 
there's something in that context that you think

04:25.849 --> 04:28.836
is notable. No, he planned, that was the whole 
business of introducing me to all these people.

04:34.748 --> 04:40.260
Now, there was a big to-do about the retirement, as 
I recall. there must have been but you know i can't

04:41.084 --> 05:09.673
recall you did a lot you had a lot to do with it and it 
seemed to me in terms of the uh preparing for

04:41.084 --> 05:09.673
preparing for you know kind of a well i'll tell you i 
don't remember as much anything about that nearly

04:41.084 --> 05:09.673
as what i remember about his his funeral yeah right 
now that was big yeah we'll hold that yeah and get to

04:41.084 --> 05:09.673
that i don't i don't recall i remember some dinners 
yeah maybe that was all some of the conventional

04:41.084 --> 05:09.673
dinners but i don't um By that time, Jack Williams 
was not there. Okay, let's get to that point right

05:13.290 --> 05:15.733
now. Wardlaw retired in 78, I believe. That sounds 
about right. And you became director. Yes, I think

05:21.421 --> 05:23.323
that was from 78 to 88. And Jack was still in hand. He 
had become chancellor. He had become chancellor,

05:28.309 --> 05:29.611
yes. Now, was the press under the chancellor or the 
president? I'm trying to remember myself now. I

05:36.340 --> 05:38.662
believe that Williams took the press with him. I 
think he did, too. did take the press with him okay

05:39.252 --> 06:06.711
so so you're reporting to jack williams yes as a 
director yes and and there is a good accord good

05:39.252 --> 06:06.711
relationship with jack williams absolutely it 
was it was indispensable at that point and now

05:39.252 --> 06:06.711
that's 78. i guess the first step is within six 
months of your becoming director the press

05:39.252 --> 06:06.711
building burned yes In connection with this 
business of the reporting, when Vandiver came in,

06:07.147 --> 06:24.124
I think that's when I was supposed to report to the 
President rather than the Chancellor again. Oh,

06:24.144 --> 06:25.105
okay. I think that was it. It may have—was there a 
teacher? There wasn't a professor for Vandiver,

06:30.471 --> 06:34.074
it was Miller, but who was it? Frank Hubert was it? 
No, wait. Well, as a matter of fact, Clyde Wells was

06:38.500 --> 06:42.885
an interim for a short time. That's when it 
changed, when I started reporting to the

06:42.965 --> 06:47.591
president. I must have reported to Miller. I'll 
find out. I don't know exactly how that went, but I

06:52.336 --> 06:56.541
don't recall. Times were very confusing in that 
shuffle. That's kind of what I was... Yeah, it was

06:59.144 --> 07:02.028
very confusing. And also very hazardous to the 
health of the press, perhaps. Did you sense

07:07.134 --> 07:08.035
anything? any problems there. Well, now, when 
this came, when did it come, when did that, the

07:10.040 --> 07:18.591
second infusion of cash from the Regents? That was 
during... Warden Law was gone by then. Yeah, that

07:22.155 --> 07:34.391
was, I think in... And we needed $20,000

07:22.155 --> 07:34.391
or something of that sort, and we got it, but nobody 
expected us to get it. And Frank was very upset and

07:34.571 --> 07:38.376
worried about the financial he was yes he was and i 
have some letters from him written to me from rice

07:38.744 --> 08:05.410
as i recall right after the fire yeah and he was very 
concerned about the press and then in fact you and

07:38.744 --> 08:05.410
uh warren law responded with letters to wells and 
williams or someone else saying no this is we were

07:38.744 --> 08:05.410
not that desperate things are okay we're going to 
make that we're going to get through this But Frank

08:06.115 --> 08:12.645
may have been useful in triggering a sense of 
alarm. And I wondered about this. If that

08:15.249 --> 08:22.261
conceivably began to catch the region's 
attention for a moment, that maybe they'd better

08:15.249 --> 08:22.261
deal with this situation. Because apparently 
they were not interested in dealing with it

08:22.561 --> 08:26.247
directly. It just sprang out of the earth, it 
seemed to, as far as I was concerned. I don't

08:30.534 --> 08:33.979
remember any advance warning about the damn 
thing. yeah i'll go to hubert and see if hubert

08:34.212 --> 09:00.473
would yeah he's he's crucial to this yeah uh but 
that's i that's what i felt like a really stormy

08:34.212 --> 09:00.473
difficult time and i hadn't really appreciated it 
until i started looking into this frank wrote me a

08:34.212 --> 09:00.473
very depressing letter maybe yes i saw that letter 
yeah yeah where i would just have to pull in our i'd

08:34.212 --> 09:00.473
have to pull in my horns and yeah tough it out yeah 
yeah people were very depressed and this was a

09:00.672 --> 09:25.161
really tough you know and he communicated that he 
wrote that same letter sent copies of it or

09:00.672 --> 09:25.161
something to half the world oh yes yeah and then 
several regions responded directly to him he sent

09:00.672 --> 09:25.161
a copy of it to joe and betty moore he sent a copy of it 
to pride wells he sent it to a lot of people that's

09:00.672 --> 09:25.161
what they did and That may have. I was really 
wondering about that. But the response to that

09:28.023 --> 09:31.830
letter was, no, these things are not that bad at 
all, Frank. You don't understand. But, you know,

09:34.474 --> 09:40.786
that could have been a trigger, and I've always 
wondered about that. That's another thing about

09:40.866 --> 09:44.252
Frank. He let you know just what you needed to know, 
period. Yeah. He never expanded or explained.

09:56.193 --> 09:57.615
It was forward march. So Wardlaw retires. You're 
in control. Do you have any special change of

10:02.000 --> 10:06.847
direction or policies? No. One of the things that

10:07.247 --> 10:15.398
you're in charge of the press. Basically, your 
charge is to continue to thrust the direction of

10:15.850 --> 10:23.179
the Texas A&M University Press as it has been 
established by Frank Wardlaw. In fact, I would

10:23.660 --> 10:28.165
argue that you were not given a lot of options 
because of the character of the funding. This is

10:28.185 --> 10:29.787
one of the things that I'm following. That's 
correct. That Wardlaw really defined things.

10:33.892 --> 10:38.819
Yeah, the logic of the financial logic determined 
the direction. That's right. And he knew it, I

10:39.459 --> 10:40.741
think. Well, and it wasn't a bad direction. No, no. 
In fact, I think one of the things that happened

10:46.782 --> 10:56.913
briefly during my time there, was that A&M 
preempted the regional publishing material.

10:59.396 --> 11:05.643
I remember, what's the guy that runs the Texas 
State Historical? Tuffy, Tuffy Ellis. No, who's

11:08.226 --> 11:10.208
Tuffy Ellis's successor?

11:12.567 --> 11:22.952
I remember Ron Tyler saying to me once that every 
time he looked for a manuscript, he found out that

11:12.567 --> 11:22.952
Texas A&M had already been there. And that during 
that time, for a while there, Texas A&M got a lot of

11:30.134 --> 11:42.570
the Texas Institute of Letters awards, and that 
was sort of a peak moment, which disappeared

11:30.134 --> 11:42.570
almost once as I disappeared. I don't know that 
that was, but that was a...

11:42.590 --> 11:59.652
Now, let's briefly look at the fire, because 
shortly after you became... That was the first

11:42.590 --> 11:59.652
really big crisis, yes. And that occurred what 
day? Do you remember? It's deeply in your mind. Not

12:06.497 --> 12:09.981
today, but the occasion I can remember. We got a 
phone call. The phone rang in the very early

12:11.103 --> 12:14.787
morning. It said the building was burning. I don't 
know who it was. The Williamses were still in their

12:20.934 --> 12:25.279
apartment, weren't they, at that point, I think. 
Yes. And was Buck Shewitt still living in the

12:25.923 --> 12:28.807
building? No. Okay, he had left. I know there was no 
mention of him. No, it was the Williams were living

12:34.474 --> 12:37.338
in the apartment at the time. And the students came 
in and helped haul stuff out of their apartment,

12:37.358 --> 12:44.788
mainly, but the upstairs was gone. It started 
above the press offices, basically. As I

12:48.532 --> 12:55.862
remember, there was some repair work going on, and 
somebody left an electric light Oh, okay. A big

12:58.245 --> 13:01.429
light, I don't know, 200, 300 watts or something. 
They put material over it, and it caught on fire and

13:01.830 --> 13:06.716
blew it. And the reason they got out as much stuff as 
was gotten out was that it burned down from the top.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.226
It didn't come up from the bottom. And they got to it 
in time. One of the things that was very lucky was

13:18.230 --> 13:24.297
that very little of the important records were 
lost. We got out almost, the loss of any records,

13:26.512 --> 13:32.278
any files was, you know. The roof literally fell on 
your desk and file cabinets, and that helped.

13:36.562 --> 13:46.913
Yeah, that collapsed, that's right, yeah, 
especially in that big room, in the big meeting

13:36.562 --> 13:46.913
room, and I think in my office, and all over. So when 
you arrived, it's burning. Yes, and I encountered

13:53.690 --> 13:56.393
President Miller, who was also there. And he was 
upset.

14:01.678 --> 14:12.890
OK. And after the fire, the press is going to resume 
its duties in the garage, basically, which is the

14:01.678 --> 14:12.890
storeroom. Well, it was also a portable. There was 
a portable trailer that was moved in. to the site at

14:21.584 --> 14:23.987
the press building? I didn't remember the trailer 
there. I remember the trailers y'all moved into

14:25.308 --> 14:30.734
later, but at first you started off in the garage. 
Well, not very long. Those buildings, those

14:32.536 --> 14:37.361
portable buildings were in there behind where the 
original... There were two of those. There were

14:38.623 --> 14:39.163
two. They were joined together. You must have been 
in those. Oh, yeah, I was in those. And across the

14:43.428 --> 14:50.916
street, there was a garage, and this is where... 
There was a, we had a lot of books that we brought in

14:52.128 --> 15:01.904
instead of having to go out to the place on the 
highway. It's

15:02.004 --> 15:10.078
where the nautical archaeology was, the annex. 
Riverside campus, they call it now. Oh, okay.

15:13.644 --> 15:17.410
That's where the major storage area was, but we 
also had this... place right across the street

15:17.980 --> 15:21.846
where they could do packing. Now,

15:21.986 --> 15:34.805
after the fire, what was the initial 
administrative reaction or involvement or

15:21.986 --> 15:34.805
situation?

15:39.633 --> 15:45.962
I do remember, and I think I mentioned this to you 
yesterday, of having a visitation from one of the

15:47.512 --> 15:54.562
regents and one of the officers of the 
administration. I don't recall who it was. I don't

15:56.085 --> 15:56.946
believe it. It was not the president. But they came 
and told me that the likelihood of a new building

15:58.949 --> 16:12.108
was very slight. This was typical for university 
presses. University presses have rarely gotten a

16:18.106 --> 16:22.613
new building. Most university presses have made 
do with basement offices, abandoned academic

16:22.714 --> 16:38.500
offices or buildings that have been originally 
intended for something else entirely. How did the

16:38.961 --> 16:41.805
thrust in for new buildings begin? As far as I know, 
It was Frank. It was Hubert's. He's the one that

16:47.726 --> 16:48.867
thrust it. It just seemed to have, it appeared 
almost out of the blue, as far as I was concerned. I

16:54.253 --> 16:58.919
had almost no advance notice.

16:59.780 --> 17:11.113
I interviewed Hubert for something, oh, I guess it 
was this pictorial thing, and he told me how that

16:59.780 --> 17:11.113
had, how he became, they had just asked him to come 
up, and he said, I thought I was going up to advise

16:59.780 --> 17:11.113
him on, what to do and they said they asked him to be 
the acting whatever it was president he said that

17:11.482 --> 17:37.033
was a surprise to me you know he's brilliant 
understates everything but apparently he really

17:11.482 --> 17:37.033
was surprised he had no information at all they 
were even thinking and i guess he was just well

17:11.482 --> 17:37.033
known well respected he was a good stable ballroom 
person well he certainly was good to to the press

17:37.216 --> 17:39.899
So, okay, I'm going to get to him on the building and 
the funding. And the building, yeah, and the other

17:39.919 --> 18:02.807
thing about the building that I remember was that 
they put it out for bids, and I don't recall who got

17:39.919 --> 18:02.807
the bid, but they constructed the, or they laid out 
the design for the building, and the regent said

17:39.919 --> 18:02.807
that was not satisfactory. And you look at that 
building now, and it's, It was originally

18:07.085 --> 18:15.876
designed for all of the offices' spaces to be on the 
perimeter with a patio in the middle. And one of the

18:16.077 --> 18:27.972
regents, and I don't remember which one, refused 
to waste that much space in a building on space that

18:16.077 --> 18:27.972
could not be used for anything, just for looks. And 
so at the last minute, they dumped the original

18:28.272 --> 18:36.383
design and they took

18:37.122 --> 19:06.657
one of the employees of the buildings and grounds 
his first name was bob and i don't remember what his

18:37.122 --> 19:06.657
last name is but he essentially redesigned the 
building and that's what is the result now that

18:37.122 --> 19:06.657
bullpen that exists in the middle now we're all 
where the the building shipping and building

18:37.122 --> 19:06.657
people all sit that was that was supposed to be the 
patio patio was open to the sky And there was going

19:06.873 --> 19:14.584
to be more offices back toward the warehouse 
structure. I don't remember exactly how it all

19:14.604 --> 19:19.772
looked, but it was going to be a whole thing.

19:22.716 --> 19:32.610
And the library was another area that Bob just 
completely did over on the spur of the moment. It

19:33.080 --> 19:39.592
isn't a bad-looking building now, but it could 
have been spectacular. It was unique at the time. I

19:40.895 --> 19:49.751
mean, it got a lot of attention among other 
university presses because there were very few,

19:40.895 --> 19:49.751
like I say, that had their own building. The 
dedication was in 1983. When was that finished? Do

19:52.978 --> 19:56.404
you remember by any chance? The fire is in, 
whatever it was, December, oh, I can't remember,

19:56.705 --> 20:07.396
February of,

19:56.705 --> 20:07.396
February of 79? 79. No, no, that's wrong. I believe 
that's right, I don't know. Yeah, I don't remember

20:10.600 --> 20:12.562
how long we were in those graves. The dedication 
was 83. 83, yeah. Well, we were in the building. You

20:16.006 --> 20:16.566
were there. We were in the building when the 
dedication, before the dedication. Yeah, I think

20:19.570 --> 20:20.991
you were there, but I don't remember. I want to 
check that. Yeah. But you were in those trailers

20:23.148 --> 20:25.591
then for about two years. We must have been in the 
trailers for a couple of years. I'll check those.

20:32.019 --> 20:33.361
I've got all of them. Then on the, I don't know if it 
was even worth pursuing, there was a big move to,

20:33.381 --> 20:42.752
and I know how I knew him, to name the building for 
Frank Wardlaw. And I've got all the literature on

20:44.334 --> 20:47.338
there. And then letters were being circulated. 
John Lindsay wrote a letter in favor of naming the

20:49.473 --> 20:53.016
building for Frank Wardlaw. You know that? No. I 
never saw any of that. Yeah. And then there was a

20:58.982 --> 21:03.506
letter from someone to Clyde Wells. Clyde Wells 
said, I'm sorry, we have already made that

21:04.967 --> 21:08.791
decision. It's not going to be named for Frank 
Wardlaw. There was a letter somewhere, or at least

21:13.255 --> 21:18.940
there was pressure applied by Ford Albridge who 
lobbied very hard for John Lindsay. Yeah, and I

21:24.680 --> 21:35.917
don't know if it's really out of the blue, you know, 
you don't know how much Lindsay knew, but there is

21:24.680 --> 21:35.917
a, anyway, it was very clear the regents had 
already decided. And all that was going on outside

21:35.937 --> 21:41.986
of their whatever, and then, you know, it's a done 
deal. Yes, I don't know, but I know that Auburn was

21:42.286 --> 21:48.235
very, very, active in wanting names or anything. 
And these were, you know, former, this is kind of a

21:54.839 --> 21:58.403
former student trust. What was your 
relationship, incidentally, to the former

21:58.423 --> 22:06.571
students as director?

22:06.592 --> 22:09.615
Only... How about Buck Weir, specifically? He was 
very helpful, yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He was, as

22:12.998 --> 22:17.243
long as he was there, well, even after It was always 
very cordial, but there was no, I don't recall that

22:17.442 --> 22:30.481
there was any...

22:17.442 --> 22:30.481
How about Jerry Cooper with the Texas Aggie 
magazine? Yes, we always had, he was frequently

22:30.662 --> 22:41.818
advertised or ran items about in the press. Is he 
still there?

22:46.826 --> 22:46.926
Yeah. You know that book that we did, The Walking 
Soul? Yes. I kept trying to get Yama to sell a

22:52.502 --> 23:10.620
pedalette in a football game, and she said, we 
can't do that because they want the, you know,

22:52.502 --> 23:10.620
whoever runs the football game, they want those 
out competing with their program. That was

23:11.902 --> 23:14.044
amazing.

23:16.049 --> 23:24.738
So you've got the building drive development 
program going on from 79 to 83, roughly. You've got

23:24.758 --> 23:26.720
the naming thing going on. Now, what about 
publishing? What books? What's happening in the

23:29.823 --> 23:33.426
world of publishing?

23:35.608 --> 23:40.153
I'm trying to think of the titles that appeared to 
me. I should have brought that list. I didn't. I had

23:41.735 --> 23:42.175
to. That's okay. But I just thought maybe there's 
some titles or events or things that you

23:43.452 --> 23:49.063
particularly... The books that I do remember... 
Yeah, tell me about the books you remember,

23:49.083 --> 23:54.854
because that's what I wanted to do, is just spot 
some things. When did the... I'll go up and look at

23:56.317 --> 23:57.098
the... I still have the book. The Cowboy Life on the 
Texas Plains, Marge Rector's book with John...

23:57.720 --> 24:04.112
Just tell me about things that you remember. that 
were particularly interesting and significant.

24:07.487 --> 24:12.054
Well, another thing that I remember, and I think it 
was during the same time as this, H.W. Kaler, the

24:12.114 --> 24:17.082
Big Springs Museum book that did Kaler's 
paintings. We went, they provided the funds for

24:17.363 --> 24:21.709
that. Is that the blue? That's okay. No, I get it. 
That's okay. I get it. It's not big deal. Okay. the

24:32.088 --> 24:35.651
variety, the directors. I remember we went, I can 
remember especially going to Rice University,

24:36.372 --> 25:00.053
which no longer has a press, I understand, but at 
the time, that's the first time I'd ever been on the

24:36.372 --> 25:00.053
Rice campus, and we went to see all the 
administrators, and they, I got to wind and dine in

24:36.372 --> 25:00.053
their faculty club, and they, came aboard, and the 
first editor. Was Frank there then? Wardlow? No,

25:06.261 --> 25:08.743
no, Vandiver. I think Vandiver. I'll check my 
dates too, but I think he may still be a prologist,

25:11.386 --> 25:15.529
wasn't he? May have been, yes. He could have put the 
lean on them. I'll go talk to Frank. I saw him the

25:20.094 --> 25:27.861
other day and just chatted, but I didn't really... 
My impression on that, Henry, is that he had little

25:20.094 --> 25:27.861
or nothing to do with it. There was Bill... Who was 
the lieutenant governor? Barnes. No, no. There

25:35.546 --> 25:41.091
was a lieutenant governor that had, for a long 
time, lieutenant governor. He never ran for

25:41.111 --> 25:42.332
governor. Bill... Wasn't Bill Barnes? No, no, no, 
no. Anyway, his life was very busy with the press.

25:52.561 --> 25:54.102
And he had influence. I think he was already some 
kind of a factotum at Rice. And she had a lot to do, or

25:59.281 --> 26:10.314
I had the impression that she had a lot to do with 
agreeing to become a part of the distribution. And

26:10.614 --> 26:16.001
we also approached the University of Texas.

26:17.843 --> 26:20.185
There was no response. Basically, what happened 
is This is your plan. You're going to offer them the

26:26.657 --> 26:30.702
opportunity to distribute through Texas A&M. And 
so you look at all of the presses in Texas and you go

26:31.182 --> 26:36.808
to them, basically, and say, here's what we can do 
for you. Now, who is going with you in this?

26:39.551 --> 26:44.377
Collins, or Shira, or Noel, or anybody, or just 
yourself? I think, for the most part, it was just

26:44.457 --> 26:46.759
me. And Gayle went to some of these. Maybe Collins 
went on some of these. Collins certainly got into

26:55.368 --> 27:00.814
it as soon as they started doing something 
serious. And I met all of them. The guy at El Paso,

27:05.861 --> 27:17.735
Texas Tech, SMU, TCU,

27:05.861 --> 27:17.735
Waco, Baylor. We fiddled around with Baylor. I 
don't remember what that came to, but... Because I

27:19.657 --> 27:26.567
really think that's a big, that's a really 
significant... It worked out very well. To me it

27:29.331 --> 27:31.454
made sense to have the cooperation. I don't know 
why Texas couldn't have. Because it's a central,

27:34.719 --> 27:40.888
and especially now with this all computerized, 
the more computerized it gets, who gives a hoot

27:41.240 --> 27:42.622
Where it's being mailed from. Yeah, and all 
together, if you save, you do make. Even giving A&M

27:47.630 --> 27:51.235
a percent, you save. Oh, you bet. Oh, there's no, 
yeah. So that was really significant. I wanted to

27:57.224 --> 27:58.386
try to flag that. Well, that, yeah, you know, I 
never really, in thinking about it in retrospect,

27:58.466 --> 28:07.720
it is an important thing, but I never... We were 
just doing it. It seemed like we had a big empty

28:11.184 --> 28:23.623
warehouse, and this was a way to fill it up and also 
get some return for it. And I'll go through and I'll

28:24.884 --> 28:27.689
pick up all that we've signed on. Yeah, yeah. Any 
other recall about that process? I can't think,

28:36.185 --> 28:52.810
the one that I remember seeing, I was seeing Dick, 
or Gregory, not Dick Gregory, but Keith, and the

28:36.185 --> 28:52.810
people at Tech fairly often anyway. And it was 
just, sometimes it was social matter almost.

29:01.543 --> 29:04.808
Which sure makes a lot of sense. Okay, so this is the 
advisory council, which was one of the things that

29:05.851 --> 29:12.501
Frank set up just before he left. Yes, and I 
probably did not utilize that as much as I should

29:12.601 --> 29:30.728
have, principally because I was not well 
acquainted with very many of them, and I felt

29:12.601 --> 29:30.728
reticent, and that was one of the mistakes that I 
made would be discussed, that we mentioned

29:31.501 --> 29:36.607
yesterday, about Moshe. If I had known him better, 
I would have not hesitated to barge in and talk to

29:36.847 --> 29:46.418
him. And I regret that. Thinking back, that's one 
of my biggest regrets. Was there a scheduled

29:51.024 --> 29:53.647
annual meeting? A regular, yes, it was regularly 
scheduled. And that's John as one of the longtime

29:58.585 --> 30:03.450
members and participants in that. Now, was 
Haskell involved in any of that? Yeah, I think he

30:07.094 --> 30:08.395
was. Wasn't Haskell also chairman of the 
editorial committee? Yes, he was chairman of the

30:14.021 --> 30:17.485
advisory committee, yeah. Right. For a long time, 
until he left, I guess. Yeah, I think that's right.

30:21.670 --> 30:23.492
Then Clint became. Yes. and they came in as the dean 
of faculties yeah you know that was their for their

30:24.168 --> 30:53.466
slot uh yeah and this was peculiar to a m because 
most uh editorial committees like the one that

30:24.168 --> 30:53.466
well let's say it this way the editorial 
committees that i was familiar with before the lsu

30:24.168 --> 30:53.466
and account these people there were all the 
members of the committee were selected or elected

30:24.168 --> 30:53.466
appointed usually by the faculty senate And they 
elected their own chairman. It wasn't a permanent

30:58.444 --> 30:59.725
slot. And this had two things. It was good one way 
and bad the other. If you got a sympathetic person,

31:07.414 --> 31:11.118
it was good. If you got an unsympathetic person, it 
was not so good. Well, my inclination is that the

31:17.625 --> 31:22.710
press was very fortunate not to have gotten you in 
the faculty senate.
