00:11.180 --> 01:06.830
First time a student told me that

00:11.180 --> 01:06.830
he's going to die.

01:12.680 --> 01:19.180
Let's see, any tragedy, sad, truly sad realities 
you remember?

01:22.060 --> 01:25.240
I guess everything pales compared to last fall's 
loss. Yes. But I've had students that would be

01:27.574 --> 01:33.300
enrolled in the class, commit suicide, be killed 
in car wrecks.

01:44.180 --> 01:50.200
And I've had them tell me they had HIV positive.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.311
We've had graduate students.

02:23.300 --> 02:46.600
I

02:23.300 --> 02:46.600
don't know the person's name. But we, through what 
we've worked with international students, I

02:54.580 --> 03:13.140
don't

02:54.580 --> 03:13.140
think the department itself put any money into 
getting the body back home.

03:16.620 --> 03:18.300
I just, I don't know the particular. You know, one 
of the, one of the, one of the latest things, we had

03:20.360 --> 03:26.360
a, we had a student from Mexico lose a 12-year-old 
daughter here

03:30.390 --> 03:33.590
Christmas a year ago, over the Christmas holidays 
she died. Turns out she'd undergone a lot of tests

03:34.390 --> 03:36.670
here. Apparently the, the parents didn't know 
enough to, to check and get, get the results of the

03:37.190 --> 03:49.700
test. Because I remember she had a brain tumor or 
something. She, she'd undergone a lot of tests.

03:53.820 --> 03:54.143
They had to. They had results. Suggesting there 
was a real problem with her going on vacation to

03:55.120 --> 04:04.050
Mexico with the girl without getting the test. The

04:04.030 --> 04:22.980
ex-fan said, because I'm not sure the student's 
major, but I certainly didn't know. Some

04:22.960 --> 04:36.940
of the,

04:22.960 --> 04:36.940
so some of those things happened. And you know, we 
had a student drown. That

04:41.640 --> 04:47.760
brought a unique knaph. This guy probably knew 
more about knaph than anybody in the world. And

04:53.800 --> 04:55.820
brought him in here as a graduate student. And he, 
he drowned overnight. Some of it. You know. What

05:01.520 --> 05:04.220
about some, some of the highlights, the 
positives? You

05:04.200 --> 05:24.390
see

05:04.200 --> 05:24.390
how successful

05:04.200 --> 05:24.390
they've

05:04.200 --> 05:24.390
been

05:04.200 --> 05:24.390
just the other day. A fellow walked in. Very

05:25.370 --> 05:37.046
funny. I

05:39.389 --> 05:54.770
mean,

05:39.389 --> 05:54.770
you have,

05:39.389 --> 05:54.770
you have those kinds of guys. It

05:54.750 --> 06:14.850
was

05:54.750 --> 06:14.850
just a great experience. If they ever get a chance 
to come back to the States. That fellow from Korea

06:22.070 --> 06:30.280
had attended meetings in Orlando, Florida.

06:30.260 --> 06:32.280
He had other friends in the community, but. All 
right. Now you thought things were beginning to

06:34.158 --> 06:36.460
move forward. You and your colleagues under Mr. 
Rutter and then

06:36.440 --> 07:12.120
under

06:36.440 --> 07:12.120
Williams.

07:12.100 --> 08:36.600
I

07:12.100 --> 08:36.600
just, I mean, knowing Jarvis as I do, I just cannot. 
To this day. That was painful. Yeah. Yeah.

08:40.860 --> 08:43.018
Absolutely painful. Right. That was just not 
good. But he, he was not cut out for being

08:44.140 --> 08:46.160
interested. All right. Then had an acting 
president for a year. Dr. Vandenberg. Did you and

08:50.222 --> 08:51.160
your colleagues know? No. No, I

08:51.380 --> 10:49.420
don't

08:51.380 --> 10:49.420
think

08:51.380 --> 10:49.420
you saw him in those years under his leadership. I 
think quite well. This is about. He was here 19

10:53.400 --> 10:54.421
years. He actually was, he had longer than, longer 
than Dr. Vandenberg. So, he gets here what year? He

10:59.400 --> 11:04.570
got here in 1980, served through 1999. Describe 
his men. He was not here. You know, he was not here in

11:07.550 --> 11:09.570
a period of growth. He was here more in a period of 
retrenchment for the department. the

11:14.550 --> 11:15.333
department.

11:18.643 --> 11:23.620
So that made, I think that made the management much 
more difficult in a sense. He never, he never had to

11:23.660 --> 11:28.217
quote clout for the upper administration. On the 
other hand,

23:00.040 --> 23:09.040
he gets lectures and several, so we usually get him 
in about 30 or 40 different, so we actually have him

23:09.820 --> 23:14.720
in the classroom as many hours and we'd have him if 
he taught a class, but we put him in contact with

23:14.700 --> 23:19.903
many, many more students. Do the students seem to 
appreciate what he is? I mean, if you've never

23:23.895 --> 23:30.059
heard the man speak, it'd be worth hearing. So they 
are appropriately respectful and impressed?

23:36.294 --> 23:40.303
Oh yeah, he is an amazing man. They dedicated the 
Borlaug Center over here last year. Were you there

23:46.085 --> 23:49.242
under that dedication? Well, it gives you some 
indication of the man. He was, he was limited to 15

23:52.820 --> 23:55.458
minutes. I wouldn't have thought there'd be any 
way in the world you could get him up and down in 15

23:58.580 --> 24:00.838
minutes. Maybe it was 10 and he actually, we got him 
up and down in 15. I mean, I believe he was only

24:04.063 --> 24:07.162
supposed to take 10 minutes. Well, he let me, let me 
critique his remarks, but two or three officers

24:10.040 --> 24:16.470
sitting out there, Dr. Borlaug spoke and I leaned 
over the guy next to him and I said, he's all

24:16.450 --> 24:18.710
stripped now. But, but he, he was talking about 
that all of the adverse publicity about the

24:22.210 --> 24:28.390
genetically modified organisms and how too 
little had been done to educate the public as to

24:28.370 --> 24:35.820
what these were coming on, and, and sitting behind 
him on the stage was Dr. Bowen, Dr. Douglas. We're

24:42.900 --> 24:52.803
two members of the Board of Regents.

24:52.823 --> 24:55.770
I don't remember who else was up there. Maybe it did 
on the controller. Bill, uh, anyway, I know, I know

24:58.363 --> 25:03.249
you got it's alright, you got it. You're Douglas 
and Roy, and at least two members of the board, and

25:08.020 --> 25:10.220
Warlock turned around while he was talking and 
just shook his finger in the face every

25:12.200 --> 25:19.040
while about what we needed to be doing. I mean, the 
guy's brassy. He's absolute. And he can do it and

25:22.831 --> 25:26.400
get by with it. You know, he can do it because he's 
very gracious. He's just an extremely gracious,

25:29.120 --> 25:32.760
unassuming guy who put him down there in a 
windowless, 120-square-foot office. He never

25:36.380 --> 25:37.601
said a word. Now, he's been a part of the department 
for about a decade now or longer? Yeah, longer than

25:41.840 --> 25:43.261
that. How did he come to be? I don't know. You'd like 
to ask somebody else about that? You don't know who

25:49.480 --> 25:51.200
linked him up? Well, I know Perry Atkinson had a big 
time role in it. Perry, of course, Perry became a

25:55.110 --> 25:59.110
National Academy person. Yes, yes. And Norm was 
National Academy. Okay, so... I'm sure... I'm

26:03.330 --> 26:06.350
sure that Perry got acquainted with Norm in that 
setting. So, I expect it was a Perry Atkinson. All

26:09.550 --> 26:11.347
right. Now, Dr. Atkinson didn't come out of this 
department, did he? No, he's out of entomology.

26:15.370 --> 26:16.017
Entomology. All right, and he moved up into the 
administration. Yeah. Did you and your

26:20.578 --> 26:24.350
colleagues feel positive about that? Did you 
feel... Generally so. That it was good to have...

26:28.590 --> 26:37.040
Nobody

26:28.590 --> 26:37.040
ever accused Dr. Atkinson of being a good, classy 
teacher. I didn't. His standard statement I've

26:39.257 --> 26:41.530
heard. I never heard Dr. Atkinson say that, but 
I've heard him say it. It's all three of credit, of

26:45.270 --> 26:47.230
course.

26:52.140 --> 26:54.680
People like such a big deal about teaching 
three-hour courses. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I've got to

26:59.752 --> 27:00.700
tell you... Now, before we forget this, I've got to 
tell you about the low life in my whole... Oh, good.

27:06.658 --> 27:06.761
Good. ...my whole three years. Okay. I tilled my 
garden that year because it was unbelievable.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.191
When we were hiring... these people in the 75-80 
period.

27:21.404 --> 27:24.510
We were getting money on the university side. We 
were not getting any money on the experimental

27:24.931 --> 27:29.300
side. So we hired, about the same time, two young 
faculty members, 100% teaching. No

27:37.684 --> 28:27.330
experimentation

27:37.684 --> 28:27.330
partner or author on some of their papers. He 
wouldn't have any part of any of that. He thought,

28:30.310 --> 28:58.840
well, here's where the student finished and 
published

28:30.310 --> 28:58.840
at college level. I

28:58.820 --> 29:29.740
measured him by research publication. Absolute 
retreat. In

29:30.120 --> 30:00.460
a

29:30.120 --> 30:00.460
way, I could see that part of it was his own doings, 
his own stubbornness and hard-headedness. At the

30:00.440 --> 30:10.050
same time, I felt like if the man had the kind of 
support that he had within his department for his

30:00.440 --> 30:10.050
contributions, the people who knew his work best, 
who the heck was somebody up there to say this is the

30:12.030 --> 30:19.160
weakest person they ever saw? Now that was, that 
really, that really got to me. And I just, man, I

30:24.140 --> 30:28.160
worked my old garden. I never had anything that 
bothered me so much in my whole career.

30:33.320 --> 30:42.610
Philosophically, how does a first-rate 
land-grant school appropriately been met?

31:23.456 --> 31:29.800
I have an average of more like one every two years, 
kind of thing. But I can't see that that's held me

31:29.780 --> 31:36.800
back in any way at any level in the institution. So, 
you know, I take a dim view when people say that

31:36.780 --> 31:44.800
teaching doesn't get the credit it deserves, or 
advising doesn't get the credit it deserves. I

31:47.780 --> 31:51.800
think, I think generally it does. My posture is if 
you take those three areas, there are very, there

31:54.780 --> 32:01.800
are comparatively few people that excel in any one 
of the three.
