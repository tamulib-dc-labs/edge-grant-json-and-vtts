WEBVTT

00:10.983 --> 00:13.686
The first time a student told me that...

00:55.347 --> 01:12.588
He's

00:55.347 --> 01:12.588
going

00:55.347 --> 01:12.588
to die. Let's see. Any tragedy, sad, truly sad 
realities you remember?

01:22.220 --> 01:25.084
I guess everything paled compared to the last fall 
month. Yes. But I've had students that would be

01:27.558 --> 01:52.894
enrolled in the class commit suicide,

01:27.558 --> 01:52.894
be killed in car wrecks, and

01:27.558 --> 01:52.894
I've had them tell me they had HIV positive.

01:58.038 --> 02:23.537
We didn't have

01:58.038 --> 02:23.537
graduate students. I don't remember a lot of 
details.

02:44.967 --> 02:47.109
If I can remember the person's name. But we, 
through what we worked with international

02:48.371 --> 03:01.865
students.

03:04.467 --> 03:13.557
And I don't think the department as such put any 
money into getting the, to getting the body back

03:04.467 --> 03:13.557
home.

03:16.422 --> 03:17.744
I just, I don't know. You know, one of the, one of the 
latest things, we had, we had a student from Mexico

03:17.764 --> 03:31.663
lose a 12-year-old daughter here

03:17.764 --> 03:31.663
Christmas a year ago. Over Christmas holidays, 
she died. Turns out she'd undergone a lot of tests

03:33.665 --> 03:36.650
here. Apparently, the, the parents didn't know 
enough to

03:46.358 --> 03:50.006
to check and get the results of the test. Because I 
remember she had a brain tumor or something. She'd

03:52.632 --> 03:53.795
undergo a lot of tests. They had results. 
Suggesting there was a real problem. Her parents

03:57.944 --> 04:04.198
went on vacation to Mexico with a girl without 
getting the test.

04:13.814 --> 04:34.538
I'm not sure the students

04:13.814 --> 04:34.538
made it.

04:35.439 --> 04:37.662
Some of those things happen.

04:43.261 --> 04:47.648
one of the most outstanding students that brought 
a unique KNAF. This guy probably knew more about

04:48.490 --> 04:59.267
KNAF than anybody in the world and brought him in 
here as a graduate student and he drowned over some

04:48.490 --> 04:59.267
of it. What about some of the highlights?

05:22.664 --> 05:34.603
Successfully then just the

05:22.664 --> 05:34.603
other day.

05:43.097 --> 05:44.419
We.

05:51.453 --> 06:13.355
You have those kinds

05:51.453 --> 06:13.355
of

05:51.453 --> 06:13.355
guys. They ever

06:13.375 --> 06:21.223
get a chance to come back to the States. by that 
thought korea that attended meetings in orlando

06:21.710 --> 06:49.168
florida

06:21.710 --> 06:49.168
we had other friends in the community but all right 
now you thought things were beginning to move

06:21.710 --> 06:49.168
forward you and your colleagues under mr rudder 
and then

06:53.958 --> 06:56.143
Thank you. Thank

06:56.163 --> 07:09.115
you. Thank you.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.467
And Bill, how big?

08:30.834 --> 08:34.980
The I just I mean it knowing Jarvis is I did. I just 
cannot. To this day that was paid. Yeah, yeah,

08:39.407 --> 08:40.989
yeah. Right then. But he he was not cut out being all 
right. Then had an acting prep for a year. Vandiver

08:50.183 --> 08:51.645
did you and your? Those years.

09:15.708 --> 09:16.051
uh,

10:44.538 --> 10:47.242
How did he get there under his leadership? I think 
quite well. He was here 19 years. He actually was

10:54.351 --> 10:57.555
head longer than Dr. Woodward. So he gets here what 
year? He got here in 1980, served through 1999.

11:04.845 --> 11:05.986
Describe his men. He was not here in a period of 
growth. He was here more in a period of

11:10.132 --> 11:13.937
retrenchment. for the department.

11:18.646 --> 11:23.414
So that made, I think that made the management much 
more difficult in a sense. He never, he never had to

11:23.454 --> 11:31.406
quote clout for the upper administration of 
Marshal Woodward. On the other hand,

12:48.063 --> 12:49.046
Oh.

22:58.904 --> 22:59.725
at that time. He gets lectures in the class when 
he's here in the fall, and then several, so we

23:00.226 --> 23:18.654
usually get him in about 30 or 40 different, so we 
actually have him in the classroom as many hours as

23:00.226 --> 23:18.654
we'd have him if he taught a class, but we put him in 
contact with many, many more students. Do the

23:19.495 --> 23:22.159
students seem to appreciate what he is? I mean, if 
you just If you've never heard the man speak, it'd

23:25.246 --> 23:29.732
be worth it. So they are appropriately respectful 
and impressed. Oh, yeah. Most of them have never

23:35.118 --> 23:36.940
heard of him. But he is an amazing man. They 
dedicated the Borlaug Center over here last year.

23:46.072 --> 23:47.794
Were you there under that dedication? Well, it 
gives you some indication of the man. He was

23:52.921 --> 23:55.445
limited to 15 minutes. I wouldn't have thought 
there'd be any way in the world you could get him up

23:55.966 --> 24:00.814
and down in 15 minutes. Maybe it was 10, and he 
actually, we got him up and down in 15. I mean, I

24:04.420 --> 24:08.046
believe he was only supposed to take 10 minutes. 
Well, he let me critique his remarks, but two or

24:08.066 --> 24:19.384
three officers sitting out there, Dr. Borlaug 
spoke, and I leaned over the guy next to him, and I

24:08.066 --> 24:19.384
said, he's all stripped now. But he was talking 
about all of the adverse publicity about the

24:21.102 --> 24:35.843
genetically modified organisms and how too 
little had been done to educate the public as to

24:21.102 --> 24:35.843
what these were coming on. And sitting behind him 
on the stage was Dr. Boyne and Dr. Douglas

24:36.945 --> 24:48.561
and one or two members of the Board of Regents.

24:52.287 --> 24:55.712
And I don't remember who the officer's up there. 
Maybe Bill, the controller? Bill, the, shoot.

25:02.721 --> 25:06.947
Anyway, I know Douglass and Boyd, and at least two 
members of the board. And Borlaug turned around

25:08.109 --> 25:17.502
while he was talking and just shook his finger in 
the face

25:08.109 --> 25:17.502
of everyone I thought about. what we needed to be 
doing. I mean, the guy's brassy. He's absolute.

25:23.561 --> 25:26.405
And he can do it and get by with it. You know, he can do 
it because he's very gracious. He's just an

25:29.349 --> 25:32.714
extremely gracious, unassuming guy. We put him 
down there in a windowless, 120-square-foot

25:33.114 --> 25:36.379
office. He never says a word. Now, he's been a part 
of the department for about a decade now or longer?

25:41.846 --> 25:43.288
Yeah, longer than that. How did he come to be? I 
don't know. You'll have to ask somebody else about

25:47.431 --> 25:49.473
that. You don't know who linked him up? Well, I know 
Perry Atkinson had a big time role in it. Perry, of

25:55.139 --> 25:59.963
course, Perry became a National Academy person. 
And Norm was National Academy. So I'm sure that

26:02.626 --> 26:06.490
Perry got acquainted with Norm in that setting. So 
I expect it was a Perry Atkinson. Now, Dr. Ashton

26:10.113 --> 26:13.797
didn't come out of this department, did he? No, 
he's had entomology. Entomology. All right, and

26:16.478 --> 26:19.423
he moved up into the administration. Yeah. Did you 
and your colleagues feel positive about that? Did

26:25.434 --> 26:30.203
you feel that it was good to have him? Yeah, yeah. 
Nobody ever accused Dr. Atkinson of being a good

26:33.489 --> 26:37.877
classical teacher. His standard statement, I've 
heard, I never heard Dr. Atkinson say that, but

26:38.752 --> 26:45.422
I've heard him say it. It's an all three credit 
course.

26:52.211 --> 26:58.300
People like such a big deal about teaching a 
three-hour course.

26:58.921 --> 27:08.134
I've got to tell you now, before we forget that, 
I've got to tell you about the low light in my whole

26:58.921 --> 27:08.134
three years. Okay. I tilled my garden that year and 
it was unbelievable. When we were hiring all these

27:13.722 --> 27:24.934
people in the 75-80 period,

27:13.722 --> 27:24.934
we were getting money on the university side. 
We're not getting any money on the Experiment

27:24.954 --> 27:28.978
Station side. So we hired about the same time two 
young faculty members, 100% teaching. No, no

27:36.498 --> 27:39.252
experimentation.

28:25.317 --> 28:27.086
or author on some of their papers. He wouldn't have 
any part of any of that. He thought that his

28:31.469 --> 28:33.640
greatest

28:57.042 --> 28:59.509
back at the college level.

29:26.033 --> 29:40.229
Measured

29:26.033 --> 29:40.229
in my research

29:26.033 --> 29:40.229
publication. Absolutely

29:40.249 --> 29:53.003
true. In a way. I could see that part of it was his own 
doings, his own stubbornness and

29:54.434 --> 30:00.421
hard-headedness. At the same time, I felt like if 
the man had the kind of support that he had within

30:02.003 --> 30:20.205
his department for his contributions, the people 
who knew his work best, who the heck was somebody up

30:02.003 --> 30:20.205
there to say this is the weakest person they ever 
saw? That really got to me, and I just, man, I worked

30:21.012 --> 30:27.020
my old garden. I never had anything bother me so 
much in my whole career. Philosophically, how

30:33.848 --> 30:43.240
does a first-rate land-grant school 
appropriately...

31:19.265 --> 31:28.936
more

31:19.265 --> 31:28.936
like one every two years kind of thing. But I can't 
see that that's held me back in any way at any level

31:29.977 --> 31:35.903
in the institution. So I take a dim view when people 
say that teaching doesn't get the credit it

31:36.824 --> 31:48.377
deserves or bias doesn't get the credit it 
deserves. I think generally it does. My posture is

31:51.680 --> 32:01.101
if you take those three areas, there are 
comparatively few people that excel in any one of

31:51.680 --> 32:01.101
the three.
