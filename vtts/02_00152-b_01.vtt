00:11.180 --> 01:06.830
First time a student told me that

00:11.180 --> 01:06.830
he's going to die.

01:12.680 --> 01:19.180
Let's see, any tragedy, sad, truly sad realities 
you remember?

01:22.060 --> 01:25.240
I guess everything pales compared to last fall's 
loss. Yes. But I've had students that would be

01:27.574 --> 01:33.300
enrolled in the class, commit suicide, be killed 
in car wrecks.

01:44.180 --> 01:50.200
And I've had them tell me they had HIV positive.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.331
We've had graduate students.

02:23.300 --> 02:46.600
I

02:23.300 --> 02:46.600
don't know the person's name. But we, through what 
we've worked with international students, I

02:54.580 --> 03:13.140
don't

02:54.580 --> 03:13.140
think the department itself put any money into 
getting the body back home.

03:16.620 --> 03:18.300
I just, I don't know the particular. You know, one 
of the, one of the, one of the latest things, we had

03:20.360 --> 03:26.380
a, we had a student from Mexico lose a 12-year-old 
daughter here

03:30.410 --> 03:36.710
Christmas a year ago, over the Christmas 
holidays, she died and it turns out that she'd

03:30.410 --> 03:36.710
undergone a lot of tests here. Apparently, the, 
the parents didn't know enough to, to check and

03:37.190 --> 03:49.760
get, get the results of the test. Because I 
remember she had a brain tumor or something. She,

03:51.940 --> 03:53.960
she'd undergone a lot of tests. But they had 
results. Suggesting it was a real problem.

03:56.940 --> 04:13.660
Vacation to Mexico with a girl without getting the 
test.

04:13.640 --> 04:18.042
Excellent

04:13.640 --> 04:18.042
family. I'm not sure the students made it. I 
certainly

04:21.780 --> 04:35.760
didn't know. Some of the, so some of those things 
happened. And you, we had a student drown. That

04:41.460 --> 04:47.580
brought a unique knaff. This guy probably knew 
more about knaff than anybody in the world. And

04:53.620 --> 04:56.140
brought him in here as a graduate student. And he, 
he drowned. I don't know. Some of it. What about

04:59.420 --> 05:03.840
some, some of the highlights? See how successful

05:03.820 --> 05:24.010
they've

05:03.820 --> 05:24.010
been.

05:23.990 --> 05:33.680
Just the other day,

05:23.990 --> 05:33.680
a fellow walked in. Very

05:33.660 --> 05:43.393
funny.

05:46.638 --> 05:55.390
You have,

05:46.638 --> 05:55.390
you have those kinds of guys. It

05:55.370 --> 06:14.470
was just a great experience. If they ever get a 
chance to come back to the States. That fellow from

06:21.340 --> 06:26.710
Korea had attended meetings in Orlando, Florida. 
He

06:26.690 --> 06:32.900
had other friends in the community, but. All 
right. Now you thought things were beginning to

06:34.172 --> 06:37.080
move forward. You and your colleagues under Mr. 
Rudder and then

06:39.001 --> 08:32.220
under

06:39.001 --> 08:32.220
Williams.

08:32.200 --> 08:37.220
I just, I mean, knowing Jarvis as I do, I just 
cannot. To this day. That was painful. Yeah. Yeah.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.536
Absolutely painful. Right. That was just not 
good. But he, he was not cut out for being

08:44.760 --> 08:46.780
interested. All right. Then had an acting 
president for a year. Dr. Vandenberg. Did you and

08:50.944 --> 08:51.780
your colleagues. Those years. Under his 
leadership. I

08:54.170 --> 10:46.570
think quite well. This is about. He was here 19 
years. So he gets here what year? He got here in

10:52.020 --> 10:53.041
1980. Started through 1999. Describe his men. He 
was not here in, you know,

10:55.020 --> 11:10.190
he was not here in a period of growth. He was here 
more in a period of retrenchment for the

11:10.170 --> 11:15.190
department. So

11:15.170 --> 11:23.780
that made, I think that made the management much 
more difficult in a sense. He never, he never had to

11:23.760 --> 11:31.730
quote clout for the upper administration of 
Marshal Woodward.

11:31.710 --> 23:05.540
On

11:31.710 --> 23:05.540
the other hand, he gets lectures and several. So 
we, we usually get him in about 30 or 40 different.

23:09.520 --> 23:14.540
So we actually have him in the classroom as many 
hours as we'd have him if he taught a class. But we

23:14.520 --> 23:15.950
put him in contact with me. We put him in contact 
with many, many more students. Do the students

23:19.370 --> 23:23.390
seem to appreciate what, what he is? I mean, if 
you've never heard the man speak, it'd be worth

23:23.370 --> 23:28.720
hearing. So they, they are appropriately 
respectful and impressed. Oh yeah.

23:38.289 --> 23:40.520
He is, he is an amazing man. He dedicated the 
Borlaug Center over here last year. Were you there

23:45.750 --> 23:47.770
under that dedication? Well, it gives you some 
indication of the man. He was, he was limited to 15

23:51.610 --> 23:55.780
minutes. I wouldn't have thought there'd be any 
way in the world you could get him up and down in 15

23:55.760 --> 24:00.780
minutes. Maybe it was 10 and he actually, we got him 
up and down in 15. I mean, I believe he was only

24:04.760 --> 24:07.800
supposed to take 10 minutes. Well, he let me, let me 
critique his remarks. But two or three officers

24:10.780 --> 24:20.050
sitting out there as Dr. Borlaug spoke, and I 
leaned over to the guy next to him and I said, he's

24:10.780 --> 24:20.050
all stripped now. But, but he was. But, but he was 
talking about all of the adverse publicity about

24:21.030 --> 24:29.840
the genetically modified organisms. And how too 
little had been done to educate the public as to

24:29.820 --> 24:35.840
what these were coming on. And, and sitting behind 
him on the stage was Dr. Boyne and Dr. Douglas.

24:43.040 --> 24:48.120
There

24:43.040 --> 24:48.120
were two members of the Board of Regents. I

24:48.100 --> 24:54.370
don't remember who else was up there. Maybe it did 
on the controller. It did on the... Anyway,

24:58.980 --> 25:06.930
I know, I know Douglas and Boyne and at least two 
members of the Board. And Borlaug turned around

25:06.910 --> 25:19.280
while he was talking and just shook his finger in 
the face every one of them about what we needed to be

25:06.910 --> 25:19.280
doing. I mean, the guy's brassy. He's absolutely, 
and, and he can do it and get by with it. You know, he,

25:26.260 --> 25:29.280
he can do it because he's a very gracious. He's just 
an extremely gracious, unassuming guy. Who put

25:32.260 --> 25:36.280
him down there in a windowless 120-square-foot 
office. He never said a word. Now, he's been a part

25:37.260 --> 25:41.280
of the department for about a decade now or longer? 
Yeah, longer than that. How did he come to be? I

25:45.420 --> 25:46.681
don't know. You'd like to ask somebody else about 
that? You don't know who, who linked him up? Well, I

25:50.660 --> 25:54.870
know Perry Atkinson had a big time role in it. 
Perry, of course, Perry became a National Academy

25:54.850 --> 25:58.870
person. Yes, yes. And Norm was National Academy. 
Okay, so. I'm sure that Perry got acquainted with

26:02.866 --> 26:05.870
Norm in that setting. So, I expect it was a Perry 
Atkinson. All right. Now, Dr. Atkinson didn't

26:10.100 --> 26:13.870
come out of this department, did he? No, he's out of 
entomology. Entomology. All right. And he moved

26:16.850 --> 26:18.870
up into the administration. Yep. Did you and your 
colleagues feel positive about that? Did you feel

26:24.850 --> 26:27.870
that it was good to have him? Generally so.

26:33.472 --> 26:35.560
Nobody ever accused Dr. Atkinson of being a good 
class teacher. His standard statement, I've

26:36.540 --> 26:44.290
heard, I never heard Dr. Atkinson say that, but 
I've heard him say it. It's all three credit

26:45.270 --> 26:47.290
courses. People

26:47.270 --> 26:55.020
like such a big deal about teaching a three-hour 
course. Mm-hmm,

26:55.000 --> 26:58.275
mm-hmm. I've got to tell you now, before we forget 
to do it, I've got to tell you about the low light in

27:03.540 --> 27:05.560
my home. Oh, good. Good. The whole three years. 
Okay. I tilled my garden that year because it was

27:09.290 --> 27:11.560
unbelievable. When we were hiring all these 
people in the 75, 80 period, we were getting money

27:11.540 --> 27:19.090
on the university side. We were not getting any 
money on the experimental side. So we hired, about

27:28.800 --> 27:33.820
the same time, two young faculty members, 100% 
teaching. Mm-hmm.

27:37.682 --> 28:25.850
No experimental station

27:37.682 --> 28:25.850
partner or author on some of their papers. He 
wouldn't have any part of any of that. He thought,

28:28.830 --> 28:29.851
you know what? I don't know. He thought, well, 
here's where the student finished and published

28:31.180 --> 28:59.360
at college level. I

28:59.340 --> 29:28.660
measured him by research publication. Absolute

29:28.640 --> 29:40.695
retreat.

29:52.770 --> 30:00.980
In a way, I could see that part of it was his own 
doings, his own stubbornness and

29:52.770 --> 30:00.980
hard-headedness. At the same time, I felt like if 
the man had the kind of support that he had within

30:00.960 --> 30:07.450
his department for his contributions, the people 
who knew his work best. Who the heck was somebody up

30:11.550 --> 30:19.680
there to say this is the weakest person they ever 
saw? Now that was, that really, that really got to

30:19.660 --> 30:23.680
me. And I just, man, I worked my old garden. I never 
had anything bother me so much in my whole career.

30:33.840 --> 30:43.130
Philosophically, how does a first-rate 
land-grant school appropriately deal

30:43.110 --> 31:23.390
with that? Well, it's been a minute. I have an 
average of more like one every two years, kind of

31:24.370 --> 31:30.320
thing. But I can't see that that's held me back in 
any way at any level in the institution. So, you

31:36.300 --> 31:44.320
know, I take a dim view when people say that 
teaching doesn't get the credit it deserves or

31:44.300 --> 31:47.320
advice doesn't get the credit it deserves. I 
think, I think generally it does. My posture is. If

31:53.300 --> 31:59.320
you take those three areas, there are very, there 
are comparatively few people that excel in any one

31:59.300 --> 32:01.320
of the three.
