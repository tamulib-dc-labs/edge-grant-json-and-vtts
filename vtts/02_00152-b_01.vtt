00:11.573 --> 00:13.669
First time a student told me that

00:55.111 --> 01:06.204
I told him, sorry.

01:06.224 --> 01:12.572
He's going to die.

01:13.113 --> 01:19.220
Let's see, any tragedy, sad, truly sad realities you remember?

01:22.184 --> 01:25.067
I guess everything pales compared to last fall of March.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.499
Doesn't it, almost?

01:26.859 --> 01:26.999
Yes.

01:27.540 --> 01:37.029
But I've had, I've had students that would be enrolled in the class commit suicide, be killed in car wrecks.

01:39.010 --> 01:52.843
And, and I've had them tell me they were, had HIV positive.

01:58.004 --> 02:23.150
We had graduate students.

02:23.170 --> 02:23.510
I don't remember.

02:23.530 --> 02:27.454
I don't remember what it is.

02:44.883 --> 03:13.540
if i can remember your personal signing now but we through we worked with international students and i i don't think the department of such put any money into getting the to getting the body back home

03:16.355 --> 03:19.118
I just, I don't know the particular thing.

03:19.138 --> 03:31.512
You know, one of the latest things, we had a student from Mexico lose a 12-year-old daughter here Christmas a year ago.

03:31.532 --> 03:33.595
Over the Christmas holidays, she died.

03:33.635 --> 03:36.598
Turns out she'd undergone a lot of tests here.

03:36.638 --> 03:45.889
Apparently, the parents didn't know enough to

03:46.325 --> 03:49.974
to check and get the results of the test.

03:49.994 --> 03:52.319
Because I remember she had a brain tumor or something.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.783
She'd undergo a lot of tests.

03:53.823 --> 03:59.016
They had results, suggesting there was a real problem.

03:59.036 --> 04:04.148
On vacation to Mexico, the girl without getting the test.

04:13.797 --> 04:37.763
So some of those things happen and you

04:43.227 --> 04:47.692
One of the most outstanding students that brought a unique Knaf.

04:49.034 --> 04:59.246
This guy probably knew more about Knaf than anybody in the world and brought him in here as a graduate student and he trailed over some of it.

05:01.489 --> 05:04.813
What about some of the highlights?

05:22.630 --> 05:39.393
Yeah, successfully then just the other day, I fell along.

05:43.058 --> 05:44.520
We'd go.

05:51.419 --> 06:12.775
You have those kinds of guys.

06:12.795 --> 06:14.338
It was just a great experience.

06:19.077 --> 06:21.199
They ever get a chance to come back to the state.

06:22.540 --> 06:28.106
That fellow from Korea that attended meetings in Orlando, Florida.

06:30.728 --> 06:32.670
He had other friends in the community, but.

06:33.851 --> 06:46.424
All right, now you thought things were beginning to move forward, you and your colleagues under Mr. Rudder and then under Williams.

06:46.444 --> 06:48.846
Do you remember?

06:48.866 --> 06:48.966
Yeah.

06:53.924 --> 07:20.970
So I've always thought.

07:20.990 --> 07:21.130
Thanks.

08:25.589 --> 08:37.826
I just, I mean, knowing Jarvis's idea, I just cannot to this day.

08:37.846 --> 08:39.528
That was painful.

08:39.549 --> 08:42.433
He absolutely did.

08:42.513 --> 08:43.975
He was just not Jarvis.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.857
But he was not cut out.

08:46.719 --> 08:49.422
All right, then, I had an acting president for a year.

08:50.023 --> 08:54.229
Dr. Vanderberg, did you and your colleagues in those years?

10:30.312 --> 10:51.713
under his leadership I think quite well

10:52.182 --> 10:54.265
This is about... He was here 19 years.

10:54.325 --> 10:57.510
He actually was, he had longer than Dr. Clayworth.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.192
So he gets here what year?

10:59.653 --> 11:00.614
He got here in 1980.

11:01.816 --> 11:04.580
Started through 1999.

11:04.821 --> 11:05.942
Describe his man.

11:05.962 --> 11:08.666
He was not here in, you know, he was not here in a period of growth.

11:10.088 --> 11:16.097
He was here more in a period of retrenchment for the department.

11:18.473 --> 11:23.408
So that made, I think that made the management much more difficult in a sense.

11:23.428 --> 11:31.391
He never, he never had to, quote, clout for the upper administration that Mark Woodworth had.

11:31.411 --> 11:31.993
On the other hand,

22:58.887 --> 22:59.708
at that time.

23:00.209 --> 23:05.657
He gets lectures and he's here in the fall and then several.

23:05.717 --> 23:09.443
So we usually get him in about 30 or 40 different.

23:09.964 --> 23:14.631
So we actually have him in the classroom as many hours as we'd have him if he taught a class.

23:15.292 --> 23:19.759
But we put him in contact with many, many more students.

23:19.879 --> 23:22.503
Do the students seem to appreciate what he is?

23:22.783 --> 23:24.726
I mean, if you just

23:25.263 --> 23:29.891
If you've never heard the man speak, it'd be worth hearing.

23:29.911 --> 23:33.557
So they are appropriately respectful and impressed.

23:33.857 --> 23:36.882
Oh yeah, they don't, most of them have never heard of him.

23:37.723 --> 23:40.308
But he is an amazing man.

23:40.328 --> 23:45.036
They dedicated the Borlaug Center over here last year.

23:46.057 --> 23:49.222
Were you there looking at that dedication?

23:49.242 --> 23:52.047
Well that gives you some indication of the man.

23:52.820 --> 23:55.923
He was limited to 15 minutes.

23:55.943 --> 24:00.728
I wouldn't have thought there'd be any way in the world you could get him up and down in 15 minutes.

24:00.808 --> 24:04.412
Maybe it was 10, and he actually, we got him up and down in 15.

24:04.432 --> 24:07.155
I mean, I believe he was only supposed to take 10 minutes.

24:08.035 --> 24:19.367
Well, he let me critique his remarks, but two or three officers sitting out there, and Dr. Borlaug spoke, and I leaned up with the guy next to him, and I said, he's all stripped now.

24:21.018 --> 24:36.893
But he was talking about all of the adverse publicity about the genetically modified organisms and how too little had been done to educate the public as to what these were coming on.

24:36.913 --> 24:48.544
And sitting behind him on the stage was Dr. Boyne and Dr. Douglas and one or two members of the Board of Regents

24:52.253 --> 24:55.699
And I don't remember who else was up there.

24:55.719 --> 25:02.811
Maybe Bill, a controller, Bill, let's see.

25:02.911 --> 25:06.938
Anyway, I know Douglas and Boyd, and at least two members of the board.

25:08.100 --> 25:12.247
And Warlock turned around while he was talking and just shook his finger in the face.

25:13.830 --> 25:17.316
Every while I thought about it.

25:17.633 --> 25:19.075
what we needed to be doing.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.299
I mean, the guy's brassy.

25:21.419 --> 25:22.801
He's absolute.

25:22.821 --> 25:26.367
And he can do it and get by with it.

25:26.427 --> 25:29.311
You know, he can do it because he's very gracious.

25:29.331 --> 25:32.717
He's just an extremely gracious, unassuming guy.

25:33.097 --> 25:36.363
We put him down there in a windowless, 120 square foot office.

25:36.383 --> 25:38.105
He never says a word.

25:38.125 --> 25:41.791
Now, he's been a part of the department for about a decade now or longer?

25:41.831 --> 25:43.274
Yeah, longer than that.

25:44.075 --> 25:45.497
How did he come to be?

25:46.253 --> 25:47.174
I don't know.

25:47.354 --> 25:49.437
You'd like to ask somebody else about that.

25:49.497 --> 25:51.259
You don't know who linked him up?

25:51.480 --> 25:55.104
Well, I know Perry Atkinson had a big time rope training.

25:55.124 --> 26:02.573
Perry, of course, Perry became a National Academy person, and Norm was National Academy.

26:02.594 --> 26:06.979
So I'm sure that Perry got acquainted with Norm in that setting.

26:06.959 --> 26:10.324
I expect it was a Perry Atkinson.

26:10.344 --> 26:11.325
All right.

26:11.345 --> 26:13.789
Now, Dr. Askson didn't come out of this department, did he?

26:14.069 --> 26:15.411
No, he's out of entomology.

26:15.431 --> 26:16.012
Entomology.

26:16.452 --> 26:19.396
All right, and he moved up into the administration.

26:19.757 --> 26:20.538
Yeah.

26:20.558 --> 26:24.303
Did you and your colleagues feel positive about that?

26:25.405 --> 26:28.209
Did you feel that it was good to have?

26:28.249 --> 26:31.093
Yeah, yeah.

26:31.113 --> 26:31.313
All right.

26:32.997 --> 26:37.124
Nobody ever accused Dr. Atkinson of being a good classroom teacher.

26:38.927 --> 26:44.577
His standard statement I've heard, I never heard Dr. Atkinson say that, but I've heard he say it.

26:45.399 --> 26:48.805
It's all three credit courses.

26:52.191 --> 26:54.735
People make such a big deal about teaching a three-hour course.

26:56.116 --> 27:08.574
I've got to tell you now, before we forget to do it, I've got to tell you about the low light in my whole three years.

27:09.255 --> 27:13.682
I tilled my garden that year because it was unbelievable.

27:13.702 --> 27:19.170
When we were hiring all these people in the 75, 80 period,

27:21.108 --> 27:24.494
We were getting money on the university side.

27:24.894 --> 27:28.961
We're not getting any money on the experimental station side.

27:28.981 --> 27:37.275
So we hired about the same time two young faculty members, 100% teaching.

27:37.696 --> 27:39.218
No experimental station department.

28:24.878 --> 28:27.866
a junior officer on some of their papers.

28:27.886 --> 28:31.415
He wouldn't have any part of any of that.

28:31.435 --> 28:34.483
He thought that his graduate student finished

28:57.008 --> 29:27.015
at the college level.

29:27.586 --> 29:40.381
your certain publication.

29:40.401 --> 29:52.755
Absolutely true.

29:52.775 --> 29:53.256
You want to wait?

29:54.434 --> 30:00.421
I could see that part of it was his own doings, his own stubbornness and hard-headedness.

30:01.982 --> 30:20.222
At the same time, I felt like if the man had the kind of support that he had within his department for his contributions, the people who knew his work best, who the heck was somebody up there to say this is the weakest person they ever saw?

30:20.995 --> 30:29.344
That really got to me, and I just, man, I worked my old garden.

30:29.364 --> 30:33.249
I never had anything bother me so much in my whole career.

30:33.829 --> 30:43.240
Philosophically, how does a first-rate land-grant school appropriately...

31:19.248 --> 31:48.445
published more like one every two years but I can't see that that's that's held me back in any way at any level in the institution so you know I take a dim view when people say that teaching doesn't get the credit it deserves or advising doesn't get the credit it deserves I think

31:49.184 --> 31:51.211
I think generally it does.

31:51.653 --> 32:01.067
My posture is if you take those three areas, there are comparatively few people that excel in any one of the three.
