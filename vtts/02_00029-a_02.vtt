00:04.638 --> 00:08.765
Okay, you were giving impressions of Dr. Calhoun.

00:09.446 --> 00:13.753
My relationship with him started in the early 60s, and the Department of Commerce, the U.S.

00:13.773 --> 00:18.280
Department of Commerce started what they called an Office of Technical Services, MTS.

00:18.300 --> 00:24.570
And what they would do is they would provide you funding to answer inquiries from industry in your state.

00:24.590 --> 00:32.282
So Dr. Calhoun created at that time what he called the State Technical Services Institute.

00:33.005 --> 00:38.031
He asked me to serve as director of that, which I did.

00:38.052 --> 00:43.779
And so I had some connection with him, but the real connection, I guess, was when the Seagrant program got down there.

00:43.799 --> 00:52.610
I had quite a hunk of that Seagrant program at one time, and that come down there in the late 60s as well as I remember.

00:52.630 --> 00:54.513
It had to be before, say, the three.

00:54.533 --> 01:00.160
And I did a lot of work with the Seagrant program.

01:01.827 --> 01:10.638
because I used my industrial economics staff and stood in perfect to do all economic studies along the coast and things of that nature.

01:11.759 --> 01:13.781
And OTS had gone out of business, by the way.

01:13.801 --> 01:22.592
Office of Technical Services had gone out of business, and then I got in on the Seagrass program.

01:22.612 --> 01:28.139
So that's really the period between 65 and 73 is when I got well acquainted.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.822
Make believe that I had never seen

01:31.038 --> 01:39.887
John Calhoun, describe him physically and his style of, I wish I had a picture, I could just give it to you.

01:39.907 --> 01:54.423
Dr. Calhoun was probably the most diversified and intelligent individual I had in my life.

01:54.443 --> 01:58.547
Dr. Calhoun could grasp things rapidly.

01:59.118 --> 02:06.509
I don't know whether he did a lot of reading on these things before I come in contact with him or not, but he was always very well versed.

02:08.773 --> 02:15.604
My experience with him was through the state technical institute and through the C grant program.

02:16.525 --> 02:23.536
And I always felt that Dr. Calhoun was a very easy person to talk to.

02:23.556 --> 02:24.517
I never have seen Dr. Calhoun.

02:24.597 --> 02:26.601
Now, some people have told me they've seen Dr. Calhoun bad.

02:26.641 --> 02:27.522
I've never seen him bad.

02:28.548 --> 02:29.490
Never had in my life.

02:32.975 --> 02:37.823
But we've become pretty close to doing those years on different things.

02:37.843 --> 02:40.127
We attended a lot of conferences together.

02:40.147 --> 02:40.969
I did a lot of studies.

02:42.852 --> 02:52.688
And then one day out of a clear blue sky in 1973, on a Thursday afternoon, I was working away, and I got this phone call.

02:52.808 --> 02:53.830
It was Dr. Whitman.

02:55.430 --> 03:04.443
And Dr. Williams said, Jim, I've told you before, I was having my industrial conference start Monday, and I had the governor coming over to get the welcome address that I had every year.

03:05.886 --> 03:11.794
And Dr. Williams said, Jim, I'd like to come in with you for a few minutes.

03:11.814 --> 03:24.373
I went on down to the office, and after about five minutes of shaking hands, he said, you know, we have a vacancy as a director meeting in the taking service.

03:24.556 --> 03:28.823
that we want to create in the Office of Continuing Education."

03:28.843 --> 03:32.408
And he says, I'd like for you to get those folks.

03:32.428 --> 03:34.632
Tell me about this man, Jack Williams.

03:35.994 --> 03:38.698
Well, of course, Jack Williams and Dr. Calhoun were very close.

03:39.900 --> 03:45.088
I mean, business-wise, I don't know if I've played a lot, but they had a lot of respect for each other.

03:45.949 --> 03:50.817
So, I said, well, Dr. Williams, I didn't even know there was a place.

03:50.837 --> 03:52.960
I had the job that I really enjoyed.

03:53.429 --> 04:20.567
getting bigger every day and getting more statewide and that's the recognition i said i i'd have to think about it a little bit he said well what do you do you need anything to think about i said yes i said i want to copy the budget i said i want to see what kind of budget they have where the sources of money is coming from so he got on the phone and he called fred benson if i'm not mistaken it might have been calvin but he called somebody

04:21.357 --> 04:30.626
and told me I'd like for you to get some budgets up here for the Internet Pension Service.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.226
And so he got them.

04:31.246 --> 04:33.909
How'd of that happen?

04:33.929 --> 04:35.310
And so we just did a few minutes.

04:35.330 --> 04:35.931
He said, go.

04:39.214 --> 04:40.875
When do you think we can get back together?

04:40.995 --> 04:44.559
I said, we'll get back here Monday morning.

04:44.579 --> 04:46.501
I said, I'll have all Saturday.

04:46.521 --> 04:48.963
I said, we'll get back Monday morning.

04:48.983 --> 04:51.145
So he said, well, just give me a ring Monday morning when you're ready.

04:51.968 --> 04:54.511
And I did.

04:54.651 --> 04:59.397
I didn't get to him until about 3 o'clock that afternoon.

05:00.578 --> 05:02.881
But I went there and I told him what my problem was.

05:02.901 --> 05:04.643
And I had, you know, if I could do anything.

05:04.703 --> 05:09.408
You know, if I'm going to do this, I need this, I need this, I need this, I need this, I need this, this, this, this.

05:10.229 --> 05:11.190
Got down to the bottom line.

05:11.211 --> 05:14.194
The most important thing, I had to have total control of all the people in the organization.

05:15.736 --> 05:18.499
And if I was going to be fair with them, I was going to evaluate each one.

05:19.087 --> 05:24.713
But if they didn't fit into the organization, if I'm going to plan for this, then we're going to have to find somebody that will feel like it's possible.

05:25.614 --> 05:26.776
But anyway, it went on like that.

05:27.016 --> 05:31.821
And I had a list pretty long when I got to do it.

05:31.841 --> 05:32.822
He says, is that all?

05:32.842 --> 05:36.467
And I said, yes, sir.

05:36.487 --> 05:37.087
You haven't asked for nothing.

05:37.107 --> 05:38.529
He said, you haven't asked for nothing.

05:38.569 --> 05:39.210
He said, no, I think.

05:39.230 --> 05:40.231
He said, you haven't asked for nothing.

05:40.251 --> 05:41.712
You can't get it.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.354
And so I said, OK.

05:43.374 --> 05:45.837
So then he called Fred Benson in Calhoun.

05:46.880 --> 05:59.252
As far as you know, he had talked with each of them in depth.

05:59.933 --> 06:01.114
Oh, I'm quite sure of that.

06:01.194 --> 06:11.004
And another thing I had, see I had a lot of research projects in that industry, and this was in August when he called me in.

06:11.625 --> 06:14.828
And I told him, I said, I couldn't possibly accept the job for December 12th.

06:15.179 --> 06:17.742
Because I had sponsors out here that supported me for years.

06:17.882 --> 06:21.706
And I said, well, that'd be fun.

06:23.688 --> 06:26.931
Describe the extension service when you took over.

06:27.371 --> 06:27.952
What was it?

06:28.012 --> 06:28.773
How big was it?

06:28.813 --> 06:29.433
Where was it?

06:29.954 --> 06:31.836
Well, it was in the old American Legion Hall.

06:34.839 --> 06:36.881
Bob Whitewood before you moved out there.

06:36.901 --> 06:42.186
That used to be just an old building there.

06:42.226 --> 06:45.169
Do you remember that, or was it already down when you got here?

06:45.352 --> 06:49.581
Do you remember where the headquarters of Bob White was up until just about a year ago?

06:50.302 --> 06:51.024
No, I don't.

06:51.304 --> 06:55.773
Well, you know where the Farmer Student Association building is now?

06:55.954 --> 06:58.278
It used to be that old wooden building right across the street.

06:58.298 --> 07:00.543
Oh, across the street, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:00.683 --> 07:02.086
Over there by the police station.

07:03.088 --> 07:04.491
Well, I didn't know anybody

07:04.876 --> 07:08.240
I didn't know anybody in India and Pennsylvania except Ernie Winacek.

07:08.260 --> 07:11.023
The only reason I knew him, he had more than my age.

07:12.004 --> 07:14.447
And I had met him through Buddy Williams.

07:14.467 --> 07:18.692
And Buddy Williams, he and Ernie were pretty good friends.

07:18.712 --> 07:19.593
But he's the only one I knew.

07:20.494 --> 07:29.425
And so when I took over, they took action at the October board meeting.

07:29.445 --> 07:30.866
We had all been making a motion, Ms.

07:30.906 --> 07:34.090
Wilson Sutton.

07:34.222 --> 07:34.903
This is 73?

07:34.923 --> 07:35.103
73.

07:35.283 --> 07:37.325
No, it's 70.

07:38.426 --> 07:38.726
Yes, 73.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.607
I forgot to go to the 71st of 73.

07:41.348 --> 07:43.270
But this meeting was in October before meeting.

07:45.071 --> 07:47.533
And so when that was announced, it would come out in the paper and everything.

07:47.553 --> 07:54.159
And by the day, well, by the way, Dr. Knight, you know, the Dean of Medicine, was approved the same day I was approved to the Institute of Nutrition Service.

07:54.179 --> 07:57.362
His pitch is on the front page of these on one side and mine is on the other.

07:58.022 --> 08:03.587
And I just saw what they fixed, that monument, whatever it was.

08:04.647 --> 08:11.854
When I went over to the Engineering Extension Service, it had a budget of about $1.5 million and they had about $50 million.

08:15.878 --> 08:17.520
Where were they based?

08:18.181 --> 08:25.108
All of them here?

08:25.168 --> 08:32.495
Yeah, at that time.

08:32.575 --> 08:33.456
They weren't up to date.

08:34.583 --> 08:39.268
There was not an area that you could find that they would have to date on.

08:40.029 --> 08:42.771
They taught without lesson plans.

08:44.233 --> 08:48.818
They didn't have any technical manuals.

08:48.878 --> 08:50.239
It's a training organization.

08:50.840 --> 08:55.905
But they have 51 employees and about a little over, about a million and a half dollar budget.

08:55.925 --> 09:03.713
But their budget come, one-third come from Texas Education Agency, one-third come directly from appropriations, and then they've got one-third of their budget from the future.

09:04.891 --> 09:07.915
And that was the third, third, and third.

09:09.176 --> 09:14.243
Well, you've got to realize, engineering intensive service was an old organization.

09:14.263 --> 09:22.353
And most of the employees were in there, you know, since their first job.

09:22.373 --> 09:29.141
Anyway, when it was announced, they had Dr. Mansfield, who was the social director.

09:29.161 --> 09:31.624
And that was the final person, if you ever want to meet the partner.

09:32.735 --> 09:36.699
But he had been led to believe either through himself or through Mr. Bearden.

09:36.719 --> 09:40.742
See, Mr. Bearden had been director, and he retired, that he was going to be the director.

09:42.424 --> 09:48.649
Well, by the way, when I've become director, I'll have to do it.

09:48.669 --> 09:57.557
But anyway, and all of them in the Indian Attention Service was, you know, shocked that he didn't get it.

09:57.577 --> 10:02.742
So, the first day I took over, December the 1st, 1973, I stayed away from that until

10:03.447 --> 10:09.093
My wife went in for her third malignancy surgery.

10:09.113 --> 10:12.196
She was operating on that board the first day I took over.

10:12.216 --> 10:13.878
Two important events.

10:13.938 --> 10:16.120
Very important events.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.882
I stayed with my wife.

10:18.422 --> 10:23.087
I called Dr. Cowen, which I don't know where I called her, but anyway, they knew where I was at.

10:24.629 --> 10:31.716
And I stayed with her all that day, with Dr. McQuaid.

10:32.287 --> 10:41.301
And we had a doctor out of Houston come up, and that was her third surgery.

10:41.321 --> 10:53.920
So after they got through with the surgery, it was in about five hours, Dr. Quaid came out and told him, he said, I don't have my phone for you.

10:54.020 --> 10:59.188
And he said, we're going to send her down to Houston and start taking chemotherapy.

11:00.907 --> 11:01.968
I'm not going to dwell on this.

11:02.048 --> 11:05.893
Anyway, after the third operation, my wife had about all the operations she'd wanted.

11:05.913 --> 11:10.678
But anyway, they made an appointment for me to go see this doctor down at the Kent's hospital in Houston.

11:10.698 --> 11:11.519
And I got her.

11:11.539 --> 11:17.366
We had an appointment at 1.30 in the afternoon with my wife, and I walked in, and I checked her and she shut the door.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.028
I stayed outside.

11:19.048 --> 11:23.633
In about 20 minutes, all 15 minutes, she'd come out and she'd come out.

11:24.033 --> 11:24.234
I'm sorry.

11:24.314 --> 11:26.236
I said, your wife won't let me touch her.

11:26.256 --> 11:28.739
She said, she got me the tape from there.

11:28.759 --> 11:28.939
Remember?

11:29.341 --> 11:33.547
And he said, unless I get to examine it, he said, he doesn't look at me.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.828
So we went in, he said, come on in.

11:34.848 --> 11:36.691
I said, tell him for us that.

11:36.711 --> 11:38.293
And I said, no, you sure you made up the money?

11:38.313 --> 11:39.995
Yep.

11:40.015 --> 11:41.958
I said, how much do I owe him?

11:42.098 --> 11:43.820
He said, $35.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.023
I wrote him a check, and that was in 1973.

11:46.063 --> 11:52.291
Can you imagine that?

11:52.311 --> 11:55.135
But going back to the same thing, that's true.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.099
Where did, primarily geographically, where did,

11:58.417 --> 12:02.561
When you took over, where were they doing the instruction that they were?

12:02.581 --> 12:04.002
They were going out in motels.

12:04.322 --> 12:05.743
No, but where was it?

12:06.024 --> 12:07.465
Was it in the Houston area?

12:07.785 --> 12:09.767
Oh, it was all over the state.

12:09.787 --> 12:11.448
But it wasn't concentrated in one?

12:11.468 --> 12:12.009
No, no.

12:12.029 --> 12:12.129
Okay.

12:12.149 --> 12:12.389
No, no.

12:12.950 --> 12:17.874
See, they were doing all the training for rural electric co-ops and their linemen training and things of this nature.

12:17.894 --> 12:21.577
They did a lot of training for the Texas Telephone Association.

12:21.597 --> 12:25.561
See, they were getting subsidized.

12:26.341 --> 12:26.502
Right.

12:26.522 --> 12:28.103
Give more examples of that.

12:28.218 --> 12:32.865
Okay, and law enforcement, all the state and law enforcement, water and wastewater.

12:32.885 --> 12:35.649
They did all the training for water and wastewater in the cities.

12:36.711 --> 12:39.475
Of course, we had the fire protection.

12:40.817 --> 12:43.742
We had the extension part of it, and then we had the fire field.

12:44.062 --> 12:46.125
Fireman Training Center was all part of that?

12:46.466 --> 12:47.948
Oh, yeah.

12:48.417 --> 12:49.959
That was the biggest part.

12:49.979 --> 12:51.802
But they used volunteer instructors.

12:51.822 --> 12:55.226
They only had four people on the full-time staff at the farm.

12:55.347 --> 12:58.952
When they go to town, they'd just get somebody at the farm to volunteer.

12:58.972 --> 13:03.778
Was there one client that was by far the key one, the biggest?

13:04.239 --> 13:04.600
Was there?

13:04.920 --> 13:12.771
Well, the Rural Electric Co-op, of course, the organization was so small, they only had 50, 55 people.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.054
That's all I had with them.

13:15.074 --> 13:16.416
But the Rural Electric Co-ops,

13:16.953 --> 13:25.504
and the Texas Telephone Association, and the water departments of the cities, and the law enforcement and the law.

13:26.004 --> 13:29.549
Those were your, it was all sizable buttons.

13:29.569 --> 13:39.722
But to kind of put this thing in perspective, when I left there, we had 400 employees in a $39 million budget and was only getting $3 million in general revenue.

13:39.742 --> 13:41.524
$36 million was coming in fees and contracts.

13:41.804 --> 13:44.007
Now wait, give me those numbers again.

13:44.797 --> 13:49.362
When I took over, it was around 51, I think, employees, about 2.5 million.

13:49.662 --> 13:59.393
When I left on December, I mean, on January the 31st, 1992, we had a $39 million budget, and we had 400 employees.

13:59.413 --> 14:02.176
And of that budget, how much did y'all... Ten percent.

14:02.396 --> 14:05.860
We got three million and something in general revenue, and the rest you brought in.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.822
That was in fees and contracts.

14:07.842 --> 14:08.563
All right.

14:08.883 --> 14:14.449
When you started out, you were primarily serving small-town needs,

14:15.003 --> 14:20.431
rural areas and city water departments in your small town city water departments, small town law enforcement.

14:20.451 --> 14:23.315
And the telephone companies were the co-ops?

14:24.016 --> 14:24.536
Rural telephones.

14:24.556 --> 14:26.199
Rural telephones.

14:26.880 --> 14:27.981
Alright, let's see.

14:28.021 --> 14:38.035
When you took over, were there any key office staff members that you came to rely on?

14:39.117 --> 14:40.979
I'm talking about the people in the office.

14:41.260 --> 14:43.723
I lined them up real fast.

14:43.783 --> 14:44.925
I had to bring them in.

14:45.293 --> 14:52.941
As I told you, Dr. Mansfield was a fine person, and there must have been a shock to his system, because he had never heard of me, and I never heard of him.

14:52.961 --> 14:57.506
And of course, he just never would.

14:57.526 --> 14:58.808
Well, he had a different philosophy.

14:58.828 --> 15:01.571
His philosophy and my philosophy was up completely 100% different.

15:01.711 --> 15:03.173
I was used to the soft money operation.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.495
I've always had the soft money operation.

15:05.515 --> 15:06.296
I liked it.

15:06.316 --> 15:09.279
It gave me a lot of latitude.

15:09.359 --> 15:10.521
They didn't like it.

15:10.741 --> 15:12.202
It was a threat to their jobs.

15:12.363 --> 15:14.625
It was a threat to their jobs.

15:15.095 --> 15:23.383
So, but then another thing I asked Dr. Williams when I took over, I had to have a new headquarters office.

15:23.403 --> 15:25.085
I had to have another office.

15:25.105 --> 15:32.973
But anyway, I never did go down to that, but I was up on the eighth floor at the top, because that's where I had the production of continuing education, and I had that whole eighth floor in the tower.

15:33.253 --> 15:34.234
Of the rudder tower?

15:34.254 --> 15:35.495
Yeah.

15:35.515 --> 15:40.320
So, that's where, that was my headquarters for both offices, continuing education.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.402
All right, when you took over,

15:43.023 --> 15:45.887
In terms of reporting, you reported to?

15:45.907 --> 15:48.612
Dr. Calhoun and Fred Benson.

15:50.535 --> 15:51.216
In which order?

15:52.638 --> 15:55.062
I did.

15:55.963 --> 15:57.525
All three of us worked very well.

15:57.545 --> 15:57.786
All right.

15:57.946 --> 16:03.174
On paper, was it to Benson, or was it to both on paper?

16:03.194 --> 16:04.176
Both of them.

16:04.196 --> 16:04.476
Okay.

16:05.578 --> 16:08.322
See, I got funding from Virginia Education at Texas A&M University.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.695
All right, let's go back and talk about this man, Benson.

16:12.775 --> 16:16.360
He's a Kenzan, I think, didn't he?

16:16.700 --> 16:17.321
Ken State.

16:17.802 --> 16:25.472
And tell me about his working style and so forth.

16:25.492 --> 16:34.925
Well, you never did leave a meeting with Fred Benson that you didn't know where he stood.

16:35.045 --> 16:38.950
He wasn't a bit bashful to pick up the phone and say, Jim, what's this I hear about so-and-so's?

16:40.010 --> 16:41.031
You'd explain it to him.

16:42.473 --> 16:46.078
That was the end of it, I guess, for me at all, of course.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.484
You know, we had our ground rules.

16:50.704 --> 16:54.389
I said my ground rules with him, and the captain said, what do you expect?

16:54.409 --> 16:55.931
What kind of report do you want?

16:55.951 --> 16:59.115
What kind of, when do you want me to inform you of something?

16:59.135 --> 17:06.765
Give me some guidelines, because I don't have time to tell you everything I do, and you don't have time to listen to everything I do.

17:06.785 --> 17:07.906
Give me your guidelines.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.308
You know what Mr. Benson's answer was that?

17:10.148 --> 17:15.355
keep me informed on a matter you think that I should have some input on.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.798
I never called him.

17:17.819 --> 17:21.443
Not that, you know, I just never had a reason.

17:21.464 --> 17:22.605
I could say the same thing about Calvary.

17:22.625 --> 17:37.025
All right, now officially, the Extension Engineering Extension Service was part of the Texas A&M University and of the system.

17:37.606 --> 17:39.328
No, the Engineering Extension Service.

17:39.882 --> 17:41.744
It was always a part of the system.

17:41.764 --> 17:42.364
All right.

17:42.385 --> 17:51.113
During those years with Williams and Calhoun and Benson, did it matter, system or campus?

17:52.395 --> 17:52.975
Did it matter?

17:53.636 --> 17:54.597
And how you operated?

17:55.578 --> 17:56.238
Not with me.

17:56.258 --> 17:58.481
It didn't matter because I knew exactly what the system was supposed to do.

17:58.521 --> 18:00.743
I knew the policies and procedures of the system.

18:00.763 --> 18:02.264
And I knew what the university was supposed to do.

18:02.284 --> 18:07.189
And I knew exactly what I was expected of me in the university and knew exactly what they expected me in the university.

18:07.209 --> 18:09.872
When you wanted to communicate with them

18:10.223 --> 18:14.630
Whom did you have to go through to get to Calhoun or to Benson?

18:14.690 --> 18:17.394
Nobody except the secretary.

18:17.834 --> 18:23.463
They all, you always, he had the same, they had the same thing with me.

18:23.483 --> 18:27.168
I mean, we never, I never had one minute that I ever thought.

18:28.530 --> 18:39.066
All right, as you think back on those first years, what were some key decisions that were made by you or anybody else?

18:39.772 --> 18:45.579
or pertaining to the work of the Extension Service?

18:46.620 --> 18:55.791
Well, I'm not being derogatory because I make this statement, but I had to have people that would grow.

18:56.632 --> 18:59.176
I had maybe two people with college degrees.

18:59.256 --> 19:03.260
Dr. Mansfield had his degree, and they might have one or two others out there.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.044
The rest of them was all non-degree people.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.508
They had one title that was all called

19:10.180 --> 19:22.451
So, my first thing that I did when I went in there, by January the 1st, I had a study conducted on what their title should be.

19:23.152 --> 19:30.699
They told me exactly what their qualifications should be, as far as education, experience, and everything.

19:30.719 --> 19:33.241
And I even had no pay range.

19:33.261 --> 19:34.202
Everybody made the same.

19:34.222 --> 19:37.825
If you're an instructor, you make the same.

19:37.845 --> 19:39.647
Or give or take.

19:40.167 --> 20:03.036
So the first thing we did, we'd give them something to, and then in February of that year, I had a meeting in Wine Deal with the whole staff, a day and a half, two days of meeting, at which time I'd give them a copy of what I call management by objective, and how we was going to run anything services, what part they were going to play, what was expected of it, and so forth and so on.

20:03.056 --> 20:05.859
And that didn't go too well, though.

20:05.879 --> 20:09.043
But anyway, there was a few.

20:10.272 --> 20:11.673
You know, they really didn't touch it.

20:11.693 --> 20:13.555
But you've got to remember, this was an old organization.

20:13.575 --> 20:15.257
They had all been in together.

20:15.277 --> 20:17.759
Here's a damn strange investment.

20:18.680 --> 20:24.625
But anyway, after we had that meeting, and none of them understood management at all.

20:24.746 --> 20:26.327
They didn't know what management by objective was.

20:26.347 --> 20:29.030
They didn't, you know, it just had never been explained.

20:29.050 --> 20:38.018
But anyway, when we started putting that thing together, and then on June the 1st, I come into a recommendation with Dr. Williams.

20:39.196 --> 20:43.561
This is for the Engineer Protection Service and a recommendation with Dr. Williams, who's Fred Benson.

20:43.581 --> 20:45.183
I kept Fred informed on him.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.846
He told me to take it to Dr. Williams on pay scale.

20:49.668 --> 20:57.557
And they had about, I'd say they had about $500,000 in the service.

20:57.777 --> 21:06.047
So we'd automatically, you know, if they had the qualifications, they'd go into this pay status.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.704
to find somebody who had those cross missions and so forth.

21:09.725 --> 21:16.154
So we'd give them each title, training specialist, associate training specialist, assistant training specialist, you know, give them to separate them.

21:17.175 --> 21:22.282
But what was the question?

21:22.302 --> 21:24.285
Well, it was about key decisions.

21:24.465 --> 21:25.587
Okay.

21:25.607 --> 21:26.969
That's how the decisions were made.

21:26.989 --> 21:33.638
And then once we got that thing in line, then unfortunately Burrow got the plans, you know,

21:34.394 --> 21:40.179
decided to take retirement.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.962
He was about 65 years old.

21:42.982 --> 21:47.226
And he decided to take retirement and took retirement and three days later died.

21:47.246 --> 21:49.969
But he'd had bypass surgery.

21:49.989 --> 21:56.655
So that moved that phase, whatever you want to call it, out.

21:56.695 --> 21:59.037
And then I brought in a new man as associate director.

21:59.057 --> 22:01.039
I brought in Milton Franklin, right off.

22:01.380 --> 22:02.260
He was a young engineer.

22:02.901 --> 22:03.962
How do you spell his last name?

22:04.280 --> 22:07.905
He was a young man.

22:07.925 --> 22:08.826
He was with TTI.

22:11.010 --> 22:12.412
And how did he come about being in us?

22:12.532 --> 22:15.416
TTI was getting into public works training.

22:15.436 --> 22:17.619
Well, I had created a center for public works.

22:19.081 --> 22:20.984
And I picked up the paper one Saturday morning.

22:21.004 --> 22:25.150
There was TTI announcing that public works.

22:26.151 --> 22:27.473
So, I got a hold of Fred.

22:27.493 --> 22:30.037
I said, Fred, we've got a problem.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.999
And I said, what's the problem?

22:32.020 --> 22:32.380
I told him.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.615
He said, I'll take care of that Monday morning.

22:35.635 --> 22:38.418
So he had Jack Keese in the morning.

22:38.678 --> 22:41.541
He could get out of public work.

22:41.721 --> 22:44.024
That's an extension activity.

22:44.044 --> 22:46.707
That's not a research activity.

22:46.727 --> 22:50.150
And so Milton Rutkey was in that position for TPI.

22:50.631 --> 22:56.517
So I just transferred him and one other TPI staff member.

22:57.078 --> 23:02.704
And it turned out that Milton, he's a very good engineer, and a very smart individual, and a very, very good writer.

23:04.118 --> 23:06.000
Hard work, very hard work.

23:06.020 --> 23:06.701
So I brought him over.

23:06.741 --> 23:08.522
So I said, director, well, that made all the rest of it.

23:08.843 --> 23:10.444
Well, I didn't do it by at all.

23:10.504 --> 23:12.346
He was there a year, a year and a half.

23:12.446 --> 23:15.509
You know, I observed him for a time.

23:15.529 --> 23:16.710
But that's how that got started.

23:16.791 --> 23:22.376
But when you have to have a decision made, it took me less than five minutes to get it.

23:22.396 --> 23:23.437
I could call Benson.

23:23.938 --> 23:25.039
He'd say, well, what did you do?

23:25.179 --> 23:26.120
Or what do you want to do?

23:26.140 --> 23:27.561
Or I could call Calhoun.

23:28.362 --> 23:33.007
And Calhoun wasn't as quick on the draw as Benson was, but he was still very quick.

23:33.027 --> 23:33.467
You know what I mean?

23:33.886 --> 23:42.298
I mean, I'd have more conversation with Calhoun than I would with Benson.

23:42.318 --> 23:47.264
Did you ever get the impression that either one of them ever made a snap judgment without thinking it through?

23:47.665 --> 23:47.865
I'm sure.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.769
There are quite few of us.

23:50.789 --> 23:53.593
I think everybody who's done their best done that.

23:54.194 --> 23:54.595
Let's see.

23:54.775 --> 23:57.318
Back to other decisions.

23:57.859 --> 24:00.062
Because you're in charge for 19 years.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.682
73 to 92.

24:02.822 --> 24:09.811
Other decisions that you now look back on and say, those were key decisions we made.

24:10.492 --> 24:17.621
Well, one key decision we made, you always build on your strength.

24:17.641 --> 24:22.387
We had a reputation in the fire department, all over the state of town.

24:22.407 --> 24:24.970
I could contact every legislator with one phone call.

24:27.110 --> 24:28.712
So I said, that's our face.

24:28.732 --> 24:31.817
So the first thing I did, I put about $150,000 in that far.

24:32.998 --> 24:36.843
And I said, look, we don't have any roads in here.

24:36.864 --> 24:40.969
You know, we don't have any training aids out there or exhibits.

24:40.989 --> 24:42.591
So I put that right on.

24:43.052 --> 24:48.780
And that was located then where it is now, just east of Easterwood Airport.

24:48.840 --> 24:49.080
Right.

24:49.681 --> 24:54.568
And Calhoun was responsible for getting that location along before I took over to the detention center.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.003
So we started building on that.

24:57.023 --> 24:59.287
Then I said, okay, what's your second strength?

24:59.307 --> 25:09.202
Well, my second strength was electronics, but I had a man in electronics that, you know, had no education to speak of, and so his name was Arthur Pat, a fine person.

25:09.903 --> 25:17.274
All these people out of town are fine people, and that wasn't the problem with them, was that they didn't have the background to do what was necessary.

25:17.294 --> 25:20.700
So I replaced him right off with Dr. Lloyd Fight.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.721
F-I-T-E.

25:21.781 --> 25:22.302
F-I-T-E.

25:22.322 --> 25:23.644
He was Dick Winertis.

25:24.029 --> 25:26.291
handyman, you can do it, you know?

25:26.711 --> 25:31.396
So, Dick would already call me up one day.

25:31.456 --> 25:35.600
He said, Jim, he said, Lloyd didn't get his tenure.

25:35.620 --> 25:39.904
And he said, he said, you want to get out of the academic department?

25:39.924 --> 25:42.066
He said, is there any way you can take him halftime?

25:42.386 --> 25:44.188
I said, sure.

25:44.208 --> 25:46.330
Well, I took Lloyd over there with halftime with understanding.

25:46.350 --> 25:47.150
That was in February.

25:47.170 --> 25:50.874
Halftime, September the 1st, you could go on a phone call.

25:50.894 --> 25:52.095
And we had a degree with a nurse.

25:53.172 --> 25:58.259
And so we then started leaning pretty heavy on electronics, and we got that thing built up.

25:59.220 --> 26:05.328
We had a gentleman in the rural electric co-ops.

26:05.408 --> 26:12.538
At one time, the same gentleman was over rural electric co-op training and the Texas Telephone Association training.

26:12.558 --> 26:18.166
So when he retired, I saw that was my strength company.

26:18.186 --> 26:22.892
In the meantime, I got to be very, very well-informed and acquainted with both

26:23.328 --> 26:28.393
with people on the Texas Telephone Association board and the electric parties of the board.

26:28.413 --> 26:29.794
And they were lobbying for me.

26:29.814 --> 26:35.580
The real electric co-ops would take the engineering extension service with their lobbyists for funding.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.603
And same thing with the Texas Telephone Association.

26:39.063 --> 26:43.447
So I said, well, you know, that's a pro-therapy.

26:43.467 --> 26:45.429
Maybe not real electric, but you know, you've got others.

26:45.449 --> 26:48.772
So we started tying in with GTE.

26:48.792 --> 26:49.993
Started tying in with several others.

26:50.334 --> 26:51.715
Got all their training materials.

26:52.133 --> 26:57.738
They'd give me every bit of their training materials, you could use, reproduce.

26:57.758 --> 27:01.441
But at that time, see, none of my people had nothing, no training materials.

27:01.461 --> 27:05.345
So we got that from the telephone train, from the Telltale.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.708
Then we started getting the power train, electric power.

27:09.088 --> 27:13.712
The real electric co-op didn't have any, but it used to light the power at that time, had plenty.

27:13.732 --> 27:18.116
The big one that really helped me out on my electric train was Texas Power and Light.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.638
It's now Texas Utility.

27:21.648 --> 27:23.590
That's how we built the thing.

27:23.610 --> 27:24.611
We took those growth areas.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.914
And then after, you know, we valued, re-evalued them.

27:27.934 --> 27:35.121
And if they had no growth potential, you know, you say, you know, we maybe ought to take them out, which we did.

27:35.181 --> 27:36.823
We did away with three or four divisions.

27:37.163 --> 27:37.684
What were they?

27:39.165 --> 27:39.686
Oh, boy.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.593
They were always one-man operations.

27:47.153 --> 27:50.997
One, we had, well, one thing we did,

27:51.213 --> 27:54.798
FIRE had to have this material, and I took that directly away from the FIRE.

27:55.459 --> 27:58.482
I started to have this training, the whole division of it.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.986
But Al Sterling, a very fine guy.

28:01.006 --> 28:05.231
He was a Coast Guard colonel retiree.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.636
He had his master's degree from MIT.

28:09.577 --> 28:15.204
When he retired, we brought him up there with both divisions and put that under FIRE.

28:15.224 --> 28:20.511
We did the same thing with management training.

28:21.436 --> 28:25.502
We used to have two levels of management training.

28:26.323 --> 28:28.326
One was for the very goal level thing.

28:28.987 --> 28:34.014
So then we just started to get to the higher level, the supervisory training.

28:34.034 --> 28:37.178
So we had to let, so I let that lower division just go.

28:37.218 --> 28:39.782
We just started when I called supervisory training.

28:40.923 --> 28:45.089
And I'm sure there's five or six others, but I didn't.

28:45.750 --> 28:49.435
But we ended up, we started out, we had five divisions, and we ended up at 17.

28:52.925 --> 28:58.573
Our staff to professionals first is the support staff, and we're about four to one.

28:59.374 --> 29:00.736
Every professional has about one.

29:00.756 --> 29:07.426
See, now that staff person had to do a lot of work while those people were traveling all along the state of town, and they had to have strong staff people.

29:08.628 --> 29:10.531
But it was about four to one.

29:10.551 --> 29:22.408
Where, in the areas where you all worked, in what area, what work area, subject area, was it easiest to raise money, and which one was most difficult to support?

29:23.283 --> 29:25.906
It was all, there was no different.

29:25.926 --> 29:26.587
Let me just tell you what.

29:27.047 --> 29:35.877
We started centers about ten years after I got there, about the 78, 79, I put in my first center in San Antonio, called South Central Texas Regional Training Center.

29:35.897 --> 29:43.305
And at that time, Henry Cisneros was on the city council, and then let him make a marriage.

29:43.325 --> 29:49.772
And they had a program over there that was under the junior college, and they were totally unhappy.

29:49.792 --> 29:52.395
The city funded it, and they were totally unhappy.

29:52.747 --> 29:59.016
So the guy, the president of the Virginia College of America, Mr. Dr. Wieland, so they asked me to take it over.

29:59.036 --> 30:00.418
I said, well, this is enough.

30:00.438 --> 30:01.860
We've got as much as we want.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.181
You know, I'll go talk to him.

30:03.642 --> 30:04.744
Well, I don't know if I talk to him.

30:04.764 --> 30:06.446
He was as happy as a lark to get it.

30:06.466 --> 30:08.208
And he said, you can't get along with him.

30:08.909 --> 30:12.114
But anyway, he had about a $300,000 a year program with him.

30:12.835 --> 30:19.885
And so then when we took over the South Central Region Training Center, when they give us, you know, whenever I did anything like that, you know, I'll give everyone's with me.

30:19.925 --> 30:21.707
You've got to provide me facilities.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.123
And you know what I mean?

30:23.143 --> 30:24.446
We can't rent them.

30:24.546 --> 30:25.167
We don't mean that.

30:25.187 --> 30:27.651
We mean we want facilities built.

30:27.711 --> 30:31.919
If you want the engineering things to come in, we have to look the part to play the part.

30:31.939 --> 30:33.922
And so we've got real nice facilities.

30:34.523 --> 30:41.396
The city got an EDA grant, and the man in San Antonio gives 20 acres of land to build it on.

30:41.416 --> 30:43.099
But anyway, we turned out to have a big thing.

30:43.119 --> 30:45.062
So then when they redid the hemisphere area,

30:45.498 --> 30:49.625
They wanted us to concentrate on electronics in that area so far.

30:49.645 --> 30:54.433
They built this beautiful, big building, right there in the chemistry industry.

30:54.493 --> 31:05.312
We had a 25-year lease, and before I left, I got two 25-year lease extensions, so that's 75 years.

31:05.967 --> 31:09.952
When we put that in, that was our first cylinder.

31:10.513 --> 31:15.259
And when I left that thing, it had about a $2 million year budget.

31:16.481 --> 31:18.704
So then the next cylinder I went in was North Texas.

31:18.724 --> 31:20.186
It was in Orlando.

31:20.206 --> 31:21.688
We went all over Orlando.

31:22.248 --> 31:25.873
And the next cylinder was in the West Texas area that was happening.

31:25.893 --> 31:32.582
Now all these people were furnishing us, these facilities, and let's see, been used to it.

31:33.136 --> 31:36.143
We went into the Houston area about the same time we went into
