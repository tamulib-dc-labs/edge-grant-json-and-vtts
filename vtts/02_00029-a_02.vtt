WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:08.765
Okay, you were giving impressions of Dr. Calhoun. 
My relationship with him started in the early 60s.

00:11.669 --> 00:18.280
The Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department 
of Commerce, started what they called an Office of

00:11.669 --> 00:18.280
Technical Services, MTS. And what they would do is 
they would provide you funding to answer

00:18.300 --> 00:24.570
inquiries from industry in your state. So Dr. 
Calhoun created, at that time, what he called the

00:24.590 --> 00:32.282
State Technical Services Institute. He asked me 
to serve as director of that, which I did. And so I

00:38.052 --> 00:39.834
had some connection with them. But the real 
connection, I guess, come was when the Sea Grant

00:39.854 --> 00:43.779
program got done. I had quite a hunk of that Sea 
Grant program at one time. And that come down there

00:48.084 --> 00:52.330
in the late 60s as well. So I remember it had to be 
before 73. And I did a lot of work with the Sea Grant

00:54.533 --> 01:00.160
program.

01:01.827 --> 01:04.090
because I used my industrial economics staff. 
It's been perfect to do all the economic studies

01:04.230 --> 01:10.638
along the coast and things of that nature. And OTS 
had gone out of business, by the way.

01:13.801 --> 01:17.486
Off-technical service had gone out of business. 
And then I got in on the Sea Grant program. And of

01:18.747 --> 01:21.631
course, we run all those things. So that's really 
the period between 65 and 73 is when I got well

01:22.612 --> 01:28.139
acquired. Make believe that I had never seen John 
Calhoun described him physically and his style. I

01:35.943 --> 01:37.285
wish I had a picture. I could just give it to you. Dr. 
Calhoun was probably

01:39.907 --> 01:54.423
the best, the most diversified, intelligent 
individual that I have ever met in my life. Dr.

01:54.443 --> 01:58.547
Calhoun could grasp things rapidly. I don't know 
whether he did a lot of reading on these things

01:59.118 --> 02:06.509
before I come in contact with him or not, but he was 
always very well versed.

02:08.773 --> 02:15.604
My experience with him was through the State 
Technical Institute and through the Sea Grant

02:08.773 --> 02:15.604
Program. And I always felt that Dr. Calhoun was a 
very easy person to talk to. I never have seen Dr.

02:23.556 --> 02:26.601
Now, some people have told me they've seen Dr. 
Calhoun mad. I've never seen him mad. Never had in

02:28.548 --> 02:29.490
my life.

02:32.975 --> 02:37.823
But we've become pretty close, I do in those years, 
on different things. We attended a lot of

02:37.843 --> 02:40.127
conferences together. I did a lot of studies. And 
then one day out of the clear blue sky in 1973, on a

02:42.852 --> 02:52.688
Thursday afternoon, I was working away, and I got 
this phone call. It was Dr. Whitman. And Dr.

02:55.430 --> 03:01.199
Williams said, you know, now, I believe I told you 
before, I was having my industrial conference

02:55.430 --> 03:01.199
start Monday. And I had the governor coming over to 
get the welcome address, which I had every year.

03:05.886 --> 03:09.351
And Dr. Williams said, Jim, I'd like to talk to you 
in just a few minutes. And he did, and that's when I

03:09.371 --> 03:11.894
got to work. He said, fine. I went on down to his 
office. And after about five minutes of shaking

03:16.581 --> 03:24.373
hands and things, he said, you know, we have a 
vacancy as director of the Indian State Service.

03:24.556 --> 03:28.783
that we want to create in the Office of Continuing 
Education. And he says, I'd like for you to get

03:28.803 --> 03:31.947
those done. Now, tell me about this man, Jack 
Williams. Well, of course, Jack Williams and Dr.

03:35.994 --> 03:38.698
Calhoun were very close. I mean, business-wise, I 
don't know about political-wise, but they were

03:39.319 --> 03:42.444
always there. They had a lot of respect for each 
other. So I said, well, Dr. Williams, I didn't even

03:45.949 --> 03:50.817
know there was a place. I had the job, but I really 
enjoyed it. getting bigger every day and getting

03:53.429 --> 04:20.567
more statewide and that's the recognition i said i 
i'd have to think about a little bit he said well

03:53.429 --> 04:20.567
what do you do you need anything to think about i 
said yes i said i want to copy the budget i said i want

03:53.429 --> 04:20.567
to see what kind of budget they have where their 
sources of money is coming from so he got on the

03:53.429 --> 04:20.567
phone and he called fred benson if i'm not mistaken 
it might have been calvin but he called somebody

04:21.357 --> 04:30.626
and told me he had been dragged into the office, and 
he said, I'd like to get you a bunch of stuff here for

04:21.357 --> 04:30.626
the internet attention service. And so he got them 
out about half a week. And so we just did a few

04:33.929 --> 04:41.276
minutes, and he said,

04:33.929 --> 04:41.276
well, when do you think we can get back together? 
And I said, we'll get back here on Monday morning. I

04:44.579 --> 04:46.661
said, I have all Saturday and Sunday. We'll get 
back Monday morning. So he said, well, just give me

04:48.983 --> 04:51.145
a ring Monday morning when you're ready. And I did. 
Somewhere you just can't do without it. And I

04:55.933 --> 04:59.397
didn't get to until, we couldn't get together 
until about 3 o'clock that afternoon. But I went

05:00.578 --> 05:02.881
there and I told him what my problem was. And I had, 
you know, because I didn't do anything. I said, you

05:04.923 --> 05:09.408
know, if I'm going to do this, I need this, I need 
this, I need this, I need this, I need this, this,

05:04.923 --> 05:09.408
this. Got down to the bottom line. The most 
important thing, I had to have total control of all

05:11.211 --> 05:14.194
the people in the organization. And that I was 
going to be fair with them. I was going to evaluate

05:17.177 --> 05:18.499
each one of them. But if they didn't fit into the 
organization, if I'm going to plan for this, then

05:19.087 --> 05:25.594
we're going to have to find somebody that will fill 
that spot. But anyway, it went on like that. And I

05:27.016 --> 05:28.558
had to listen pretty long. When I got through, he 
says, is that all? I said, yes, sir. He said, you

05:36.306 --> 05:37.087
haven't asked for nothing. He said, you haven't 
asked for nothing? He said, no. I think he said, you

05:38.989 --> 05:40.231
haven't asked for nothing. You can't get it. And so 
I said, OK. So then he called Fred Benson in

05:43.374 --> 05:45.837
California. I told him that I'd accepted the job.

05:51.645 --> 05:54.868
And I guess Calhoun could tell you more about it 
from now on. As far as you know, he had talked with

05:54.888 --> 05:58.972
each of them in depth. Oh, yes. Oh, I'm quite sure of 
that. I mean, Dr. Williams would have done... No,

06:01.194 --> 06:11.004
and another thing I had, see, I had a lot of research 
projects in that industry, industrial economics

06:01.194 --> 06:11.004
research, and this was in August when he called me 
in. And I told him, I said, I couldn't possibly

06:11.625 --> 06:14.668
accept the job until December 12th. Really? 
Because I had sponsors out here that supported me

06:15.179 --> 06:17.742
for years. And I said, well, that'd be fun. That 
didn't bother any. Describe the extension

06:23.688 --> 06:26.931
service when you took over. What was it? How big was 
it? Where was it? Well, it was in the old American

06:29.954 --> 06:36.881
Legion Hall, where Bob White walked before he 
moved out there. That used to be just an old

06:36.901 --> 06:42.186
building there. Do you remember that? Or was it 
already down when you got here? I don't know. it i

06:45.352 --> 07:04.491
was here do you remember where the headquarters of 
bob white's wasn't until just about a year ago no no

06:45.352 --> 07:04.491
well you know where the uh you know where the farmer 
student association building is now it used to be

06:45.352 --> 07:04.491
that old wooden building right across the street 
oh across the street yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

06:45.352 --> 07:04.491
over there by the police station yeah yeah well i 
didn't know anybody I didn't know anybody in

07:04.876 --> 07:08.921
Indian Peninsula except Ernie Winochek. The only 
reason I knew him, he had . And I had met him through

07:12.004 --> 07:14.447
Buddy Williams. And Buddy Williams, he and Ernie 
were pretty good friends. But he's the only one I

07:18.712 --> 07:19.593
knew. And so when I took over, they took action at 
the October 4th meeting. Ford Hall made the

07:29.425 --> 07:34.090
motion, Ms. Wilson seconded it. This is 73? 73. No, 
70. Yes, 73. I forgot to go with you. 71st, 73. But

07:41.348 --> 07:43.270
this meeting was in October before the meeting. 
And so when that was announced, it would come out in

07:45.071 --> 07:48.254
the paper and everything by the day. Well, by the 
way, Dr. Knight, you know, the dean of medicine,

07:48.274 --> 07:54.159
was approved the same day I was approved to direct 
the Institute of Patient Service. His picture's

07:54.179 --> 07:57.362
on the front page of the Eagle on one side and mine's 
on the other. And I just saw when they fixed that

07:58.022 --> 08:02.006
monument or whatever it was. But... When I went 
over to the Engineering Extension Service, it had

08:04.647 --> 08:11.854
a budget of about $1.5 million, and they had about 
$50 million employed.

08:15.878 --> 08:17.520
Where were they based? All of them here? Yeah, at 
that time. They were a very...

08:31.234 --> 08:33.456
They weren't up to date. There was not an area that 
you could find that they don't. They taught

08:40.029 --> 08:42.771
without lesson plans. They didn't have any 
technical manuals.

08:48.878 --> 08:50.239
It's a training organization. But they have 51 
employees and a little over about a million and a

08:50.840 --> 08:55.905
half dollars budget. But their budget comes, 
one-third comes from Texas Education Agency,

08:55.925 --> 09:03.713
one-third comes directly from Appropriations, 
and then they've got one-third of their budget

08:55.925 --> 09:03.713
from the city. And that was the third, third, and 
third. Well, you've got to realize, the

09:09.176 --> 09:14.243
engineering attention service was an 
overarching section. And most of the employees

09:14.263 --> 09:22.353
were in there since their first job. Anyway, when 
it was announced, they had a Dr. Mansfield, who was

09:22.373 --> 09:29.141
the associate director. And that was the final 
person that you ever want to meet. But he had been

09:32.735 --> 09:36.699
led to believe, either through himself or through 
Mr. Bearden. See, Mr. Bearden had been director,

09:36.719 --> 09:38.680
and he retired. That he was going to be the 
director. Well, by the way, when I become

09:42.424 --> 09:48.649
director, well, I'll be the director. But anyway, 
and all of them in the engineering and attention

09:48.669 --> 09:57.557
service was, you know, shocked that he didn't get 
it. So the first day I took over, December 1, 1973, I

09:57.577 --> 10:02.742
stayed away from it until I My wife went in for her 
third malignancy surgery. She was operating from

10:09.113 --> 10:11.936
that morning, the first day I had to go. Two 
important events. Very important events. I

10:16.140 --> 10:17.882
stayed with my wife. I called Dr. Calhoun, which I 
don't know who I called. I don't know who I called.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.087
But anyway, they knew where I was at. And I stayed 
with her all that day. We were talking to Quade. And

10:32.287 --> 10:36.594
we had a doctor out of Houston come up. And that was 
her third

10:36.614 --> 10:41.301
surgery. So after they got through with the 
surgery, it was in about five hours, Dr. Quaid come

10:41.321 --> 10:53.920
out and told me, he said, I don't have much hope for 
you. He said, but we're going to send her down to

10:54.040 --> 10:59.188
Houston and start taking chemotherapy. No, I'm 
not going to dwell on this. Anyway, after the third

11:02.048 --> 11:05.893
operation, my wife had about all the operations 
she wanted. But anyway, they made an appointment

11:05.913 --> 11:10.678
for me to go see this doctor down at the hospital in 
Houston. And I got away at the point. It was 1.30 in

11:12.120 --> 11:13.021
the afternoon. My wife and I walked in, and I 
checked in, and he shut the door, and I stayed

11:13.041 --> 11:19.028
outside. And about 20 minutes, or 15 minutes, he'd 
come out and said, I'm sorry. I said, your wife

11:23.833 --> 11:26.256
won't let me touch you. He said, she's not going to 
take you from up there. I said, And he said, unless I

11:29.341 --> 11:33.486
get to examine it. So we went in and he said, come on 
in. I said, are you sure you made up the money? I

11:40.015 --> 11:41.958
said, how much did I owe him? He said, $35. I wrote 
him a check. And that was in 1973. Can you imagine

11:46.063 --> 11:52.291
that? But going back to where did primarily 
geographically, where did When you took over,

11:58.417 --> 12:02.561
where were they doing the instruction that they 
were? They were going out in motels. No, but where

12:04.322 --> 12:05.743
was it? Was it in the Houston area? Oh, it was all 
over the state. But it wasn't concentrated in one?

12:11.468 --> 12:12.049
No, no. OK. No, no. See, they were doing all the 
training for rural electric co-ops, and their

12:12.950 --> 12:17.874
linemen training and things of this nature. They 
did a lot of training for the Texas Telephone

12:17.894 --> 12:21.477
Association. But see, they were getting 
subsidized.

12:26.341 --> 12:26.502
Right. Give more examples of that. Okay, and the 
law enforcement, all the state and law

12:28.218 --> 12:35.649
enforcement, water and wastewater, they did all 
the training for water and wastewater in the

12:28.218 --> 12:35.649
cities. Of course, we had the fire protection, we 
had the extension part of it, and then we had the

12:36.711 --> 12:43.742
fire field. Fireman Training Center was all part 
of that? Oh, yeah. That was it. That was the biggest

12:48.417 --> 12:49.959
part. But they used volunteer instructors. They 
only had four people on the full-time staff of the

12:51.822 --> 12:55.226
farm. They'd go to town, they'd just get somebody 
on the farm to volunteer. Was there one client that

12:58.972 --> 13:03.778
was by far the key one, the biggest? Well, the rural 
electric co-op, of course, the organization was

13:04.239 --> 13:14.894
so small, they only had 50, 55 people. But the rural 
electric co-ops, and the tucson telephone

13:16.953 --> 13:44.007
association and the water departments of the 
cities and the law enforcement and the law those

13:16.953 --> 13:44.007
were your it was all sizable but but to kind of put 
this thing in perspective when i left there we had

13:16.953 --> 13:44.007
400 employees in a 39 million dollar budget was 
only getting 3 million in general revenue 36

13:16.953 --> 13:44.007
million was coming in fees and contracts now wait 
what give me those numbers again When I took over,

13:44.797 --> 13:49.362
it was around 51, I think, employees, about 1.5 
million. When I left on December, I mean on January

13:49.662 --> 13:59.393
the 31st, 1992, we had a $39 million budget we had 
for employees. And of that budget, how much did

13:59.413 --> 14:01.835
y'all... Ten percent. We got three million and 
something in general revenue. The rest you

14:04.919 --> 14:05.860
brought in. Just as in fees and contracts. All 
right. When you started out, you were primarily

14:08.883 --> 14:14.449
serving small-town needs... rural areas, and 
city water departments in your small town, city

14:15.003 --> 14:20.290
water departments, small town lawns. And the 
telephone companies were the co-ops. All right,

14:24.637 --> 14:27.981
let's see. When you took over, were there any key 
office staff members that you came to rely on? I'm

14:39.117 --> 14:40.979
talking about the people in the office. I lined 
them up real fast. I had to bring them in. As I told

14:45.293 --> 14:52.941
you, Dr. Mansfield was a fine person, and there 
must have been a shock to his system because he had

14:45.293 --> 14:52.941
never heard of me. And, of course, he just never 
would. Well, he had a different philosophy. His

14:58.828 --> 15:01.571
philosophy and my philosophy was completely 100% 
different. I was used to the soft money operation.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.495
I've always had the soft money operation. I liked 
it. It gave me a lot of latitude. They didn't like

15:09.359 --> 15:10.521
it. It was a threat to their jobs. Scared them. 
Threatened their jobs. So, but then another thing

15:15.095 --> 15:23.383
I asked Dr. Williams when I took over, I had to have a 
new headquarters office. I had to have another

15:23.403 --> 15:25.385
office in England. I never did go down to that one, 
but I was up on the eighth floor at the top, because

15:25.405 --> 15:32.973
that's where I had the Director of Continuing 
Education, and I had that whole eighth floor at the

15:25.405 --> 15:32.973
top. Of the Rudder Tower? Yeah. So, that's where, 
that was my headquarters for both Austin

15:35.515 --> 15:40.320
Continuing Education and Continuing Education. 
All right, when you took over, in terms of

15:43.023 --> 16:08.322
reporting you reported to dr calhoun and fred in 
which order all three of us worked very well all

15:43.023 --> 16:08.322
right on paper was it to benson or was it to both on 
paper okay uh see i got funding from junior

15:43.023 --> 16:08.322
education texas university All right, let's go 
back and talk about this man, Benson. He's a

16:12.775 --> 16:16.680
Kansan, I think, didn't he come? Kent State. And 
tell me about his working style and so forth. Well,

16:25.492 --> 16:34.925
you never did leave a meeting with Fred Benson that 
you didn't know where he stood. He wasn't a bit

16:35.045 --> 16:38.950
bashful to pick up the phone and say, Jim, what's 
this I hear about so-and-so's? It explained it to

16:40.010 --> 16:41.031
him. That was the end of it, I guess, for me at all. 
You know, we had our ground rules. I set my ground

16:50.704 --> 16:52.927
rules with him. What do you expect? What kind of 
report do you want? When do you want me to inform you

16:56.992 --> 16:59.115
of something? Give me some guidelines. Because I 
don't have time to tell you everything I do. And you

17:03.941 --> 17:06.765
don't have time to listen to everything I do. Give 
me your guidelines. You know what Mr. Benson's

17:07.926 --> 17:09.308
answer was to that? keep me informed on the matter 
you think that I could have some input on. I never

17:15.375 --> 17:17.798
called them. Not that, you know, I just, I just 
never had a reason. I can say the same thing about

17:21.564 --> 17:22.605
California. All right, now, officially, the 
Extension, the Extension, Engineering

17:22.625 --> 17:37.025
Extension Service was part of the Texas A&M 
University and of the system. No, the Engineering

17:37.606 --> 17:39.328
Extension Service was always a part of the system 
all right during those years with Williams and

17:39.882 --> 18:09.872
Calhoun and Benson did it matter system or campus 
and how you operated when

17:39.882 --> 18:09.872
you wanted to communicate with them whom did you 
have to go through to get to Calhoun or to Benson?

18:14.690 --> 18:17.394
Nobody except their secretary. They all, you 
always, he had the same, they had the same thing

18:17.834 --> 18:23.463
with me. I mean, we never, I never had one minute 
that I ever thought. All right, as you think back on

18:28.530 --> 18:37.684
those first years, what were some key decisions 
that were made by you or anybody else? Retain to the

18:38.085 --> 18:39.066
system. or pertaining to the work of the of the 
extension of the extension of the well

18:39.772 --> 19:09.508
I'm not being derogatory but I had to have people 
that would grow I had you know I had maybe two people

18:39.772 --> 19:09.508
with college degrees Dr. Mansfield might have had 
one or two others the rest of them was all

18:39.772 --> 19:09.508
non-degree people they had one title it was all 
called instructors

19:10.180 --> 19:39.630
so my first thing that I did when I went in there by 
January the 1st I had a I had a study conducted on

19:10.180 --> 19:39.630
what their title should be I had told me exactly 
what the qualification should be as far as

19:10.180 --> 19:39.630
education experience and I even I had no pay range 
everybody made the same if you're an instructor

19:10.180 --> 19:39.630
you make the same or give or take So the first thing 
we did, we give them something to, and then in

19:40.167 --> 19:48.878
February of that year, I had a meeting in Wyandale 
with the whole staff. Day and a half, two days of

19:50.039 --> 19:52.182
meetings. At which time, I give them a copy of what I 
call management by objective. How we was gonna run

19:56.387 --> 20:03.036
the engineering services, what part they was 
gonna play, what was expected of them, and so forth

19:56.387 --> 20:03.036
and so on. And that didn't go too well then. But 
anyway, there was a few, You know, they really

20:10.272 --> 20:11.673
didn't touch it. But you've got to remember, this 
was an old organization. They'd all been in

20:13.735 --> 20:15.257
together. Here's a damn stranger. But anyway, 
after we had that meeting, and none of them

20:18.680 --> 20:24.625
understood management at all. They didn't know 
what management by objective was. They didn't,

20:26.347 --> 20:29.030
you know, it had never been as fun. But anyway, when 
we started putting that thing together, and then

20:29.050 --> 20:38.018
on June the 1st, I come into a recommendation with 
Dr. Williams, This is for the engineer detention

20:39.196 --> 20:40.878
services. Recommendation of Dr. Williams to Fred 
Benson. I kept Fred informed on it. He told me to

20:45.203 --> 20:47.125
take it to Dr. Williams. On the pay scale. And they 
had about, I'd say they had about $500,000 in the

20:49.668 --> 20:57.557
services. Engineer detention services had about 
$500,000. So we automatically, if they had the

21:00.240 --> 21:05.546
qualifications, they could go into this pay 
status. If they didn't, to find somebody that had

21:06.500 --> 21:09.765
those qualifications and so forth and so on. But 
we'd give them each title, training specialist,

21:09.785 --> 21:16.154
associate training specialist, assistant 
training specialist, you know, give them to

21:09.785 --> 21:16.154
separate them. But, what was the question? Well, 
it was about key decisions. Okay. That's how the

21:25.607 --> 21:26.969
decisions were made. And then once we got that 
thing in line, and unfortunately, the borough got

21:26.989 --> 21:33.638
them plans, you know, Decided to take

21:34.394 --> 21:40.179
retirement. He was about six or seven years old. 
And he decided to take retirement. And he took

21:43.342 --> 21:44.063
retirement. Three days later, he died. He died of a 
heart attack. But he'd had bypass surgery. So that

21:49.989 --> 21:56.655
moved that phase, whatever you want to call it, 
out. And then I brought in a new man as associate

21:56.695 --> 21:58.777
director. I brought in Neil Pratt right off. He was 
a young engineer. How do you spell his last name? He

22:04.280 --> 22:07.905
was a young man. He was with TTI. And how did he come 
about being with us? TTI was getting into public

22:12.532 --> 22:15.416
works training. Well, I had created a center for 
public works. And I picked up the paper one

22:19.081 --> 22:20.984
Saturday morning. There was TTI announcing their 
public works. So I got a hold of Fred. I said, Fred,

22:27.493 --> 22:29.957
we've got a problem. He said, what's the problem? I 
told him. He said, I'll take care of that Monday

22:33.052 --> 22:35.615
morning. So he had Jack Keese in. And all of a 
sudden, he could get out of public work. That's an

22:41.721 --> 22:44.024
extension activity. That's not a research 
activity. And so Milton Rutte was in that position

22:46.727 --> 22:50.150
for TPI. So I just transferred him and one other TPI 
staff member. Their whole people worked in public

22:53.754 --> 22:57.058
work. And it turned out that Milton was a very good 
engineer, and a very smart individual, and a very,

22:57.078 --> 23:02.704
very good driver. Hard work, very hard work. So I 
brought him over to the social director. Well,

23:07.301 --> 23:10.244
that made all the rest of the, well, I didn't do it by 
all. He's there a year, a year and a half. So I

23:12.166 --> 23:15.509
brought him, you know, I observed him for a time. 
But that's how that got started. But when you have

23:16.791 --> 23:22.376
to have a decision made, it took me less than five 
minutes to get it. I could call Benson. He'd say,

23:23.938 --> 23:25.039
well, what did you do? Or what do you want to do? Or I 
could call Calhoun. Calhoun wasn't as quick on the

23:28.802 --> 23:33.007
draw as Benson was, but he was still very quick. You 
know what I mean? Did

23:33.886 --> 23:47.264
you ever get the impression that either one of them 
ever made a snap judgment without thinking it

23:33.886 --> 23:47.264
through?

23:51.450 --> 23:57.318
Let's see, back to other decisions. Because 
you're in charge for 19 years. 73 to 92. Other

24:02.822 --> 24:09.811
decisions that you now look back on and say, those 
were key decisions we made. Well, one key decision

24:10.492 --> 24:14.897
we made happened. You always build on your 
strength. We had a reputation in the fire

24:17.641 --> 24:21.966
department, all over the state. I could contact 
every legislator with one phone call. So I said,

24:27.110 --> 24:28.712
that's our fight. So the first thing I did, I put 
about $150,000 in the FARC. I said, look, we don't

24:33.158 --> 24:37.264
have any roads in here. We don't have any training 
aids out there or exhibits. So I put that right on.

24:43.052 --> 24:48.780
And that was located then where it is now, just east 
of Easterwood Airport. Right. And Calhoun was

24:49.681 --> 24:54.167
responsible for getting that location along the 
four optical vision attention center. But

24:54.188 --> 24:54.568
anyway. So we started building on that. Then I 
said, okay, what's your second strength? Well, my

24:59.307 --> 25:07.299
second strength was electronics, but I had a man in 
electronics that, you know, had no education to

24:59.307 --> 25:07.299
speak of. So his name was Art. A fine person. All 
these people out in town, you know, fine people,

25:09.903 --> 25:17.274
and that wasn't the problem with them was that they 
didn't have the background to do what was

25:09.903 --> 25:17.274
necessary. So I replaced him right off with Dr. 
Lloyd Fite. F-I-T-E. F-I-T-E. He was Dick

25:22.322 --> 25:23.644
Renardi's... Andy, man, you knew me, you know? 
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, Dick would already call me up

25:26.711 --> 25:30.215
one day. He said, Jim, he said, Lloyd didn't get his 
tenure. And he said, you know, he said, do you want

25:33.938 --> 25:40.184
to get out of the academic park or whatever? And he 
said, is there any way you can take him half-time? I

25:42.266 --> 25:44.308
said, sure, I can take him half-time. Well, I took 
Lloyd over and it was half-time with other

25:44.328 --> 25:46.330
spending. That was in February. It was half-time 
September 1st. He'd go on a phone call. We had it out

25:50.674 --> 25:52.095
to read with the nurse. And so we then started 
leaning pretty heavy on electronics, and we got

25:53.172 --> 25:58.259
that thing built up. We had a gentleman in me in the 
rural electric co-ops. At one time, the same

26:05.408 --> 26:12.538
gentleman was over at the rural electric co-op 
training and the Texas Telephone Association

26:05.408 --> 26:12.538
training. So when he retired, I saw that was my 
strength coming. In the meantime, I got to be very,

26:18.186 --> 26:22.892
very well informed and acquainted with folks with 
people on the Texas, Texas Temporal Association

26:23.328 --> 26:28.393
Board, and the Electric Fire Department Board. 
And they were lobbying for me. The Rural Electric

26:29.814 --> 26:35.580
Corps would take the engineering and maintenance 
service with their lobbyists for funding. And

26:35.960 --> 26:38.603
same thing with Texas Temporal Association. So I 
said, well, you know, that's a growth area. Maybe

26:43.327 --> 26:45.209
not Rural Electric, but, you know, we've got 
others. So we started tying in there with GTE.

26:48.792 --> 26:49.993
Started tying in with several others. Got all 
their training materials. They'd give me every

26:52.133 --> 26:55.756
bit of their training material. We could use, 
reproduce. But at that time, see, none of my people

26:57.758 --> 27:01.441
had nothing, no training material. So we got that 
from the telephone train, from the telephone.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.708
Then we started getting the power train, electric 
power. The real electric co-op didn't have any,

27:09.088 --> 27:12.431
but Houston Light and Power at that time had 
plenty. Texas, the big one that really helped me

27:13.372 --> 27:18.116
out on my electric training was Texas Fire and 
Light. It's now Texas Utility. That's how we built

27:21.648 --> 27:23.590
the thing. We took those growth areas. And then 
after, you know, we evaluated them, and if they had

27:25.352 --> 27:35.121
no growth potential, you know, you say, you know, 
we maybe ought to take them out, which we did. We did

27:35.181 --> 27:36.823
away with three or four divisions. What were they? 
Oh, boy.

27:44.310 --> 27:47.233
They were always one-man operations.

27:49.315 --> 27:50.997
We had, well, one thing we did, Fire had to have this 
material, and I took that directly away from fire.

27:55.459 --> 27:58.482
I started to have this training, a whole division 
of it. But Al Sterling, a very fine guy, he was a

27:58.502 --> 28:05.231
Coast Guard colonel, retired. He had his master's 
degree from MIT. When he retired, we brought him up

28:09.577 --> 28:15.204
here with both divisions and also put that under 
fire. We did the same thing with management

28:15.224 --> 28:20.511
training. We used to have two levels of management 
training. One was for the very bold level

28:26.323 --> 28:28.346
training. So then we just started to get to the 
higher level, the supervisory training. So I let

28:34.234 --> 28:39.782
that lower division just go and just started what I 
call supervisory training. And I'm sure there's

28:40.923 --> 28:45.329
five or six others, but I didn't write all of them. 
But we ended up, we started out, we had five

28:45.750 --> 28:49.435
divisions, and we ended up with 17 divisions.

28:52.925 --> 28:58.573
Our staff, the professionals first is the support 
staff, and we're about four to one. Every

28:59.374 --> 29:00.736
professional has about one. See, now that staff 
person had to do a lot of work while those people

29:00.756 --> 29:05.984
were traveling all over the state of Texas. And 
they had to have strong staff people. But it was

29:08.628 --> 29:10.531
about four to one. Where, in the areas where you all 
worked, in what area, what work area, subject

29:10.551 --> 29:22.408
area, was it easiest to raise money, and which one 
was most difficult to support? It was all, there

29:23.283 --> 29:25.946
was no difference. Let me just tell you why. We 
started centers about 10 years after I got there,

29:27.047 --> 29:31.052
about in 78, 79. I put in my first center in San 
Antonio called South Central Texas Regional

29:31.132 --> 29:35.877
Training Center. And at that time, Henry Cisneros 
was on the city council, and then Lenny made the

29:35.897 --> 29:43.305
marriage. And they had a program over there that 
was under the junior college, and they were

29:43.325 --> 29:49.772
totally unhappy. The city funded it, and they were 
totally unhappy So the guy, the president of

29:52.747 --> 29:59.176
Central Junior College over there, Mr. Dr. 
Whelan, so they asked me to take it over. I said,

29:59.256 --> 30:02.120
well, listen, we've got as much as we want. I'll go 
talk to him. Well, I'll go talk to him. He was as

30:04.764 --> 30:07.007
happy as a lark to get it to me. You can't get along 
with him. But anyway, he had about a $300,000 a year

30:08.909 --> 30:12.114
program with him. And so then when we took over 
South Central Region Training Center, whenever I

30:12.835 --> 30:19.905
did anything like that, I'll give everyone what 
they need. You've got to provide me facilities.

30:21.567 --> 30:21.707
Mm-hmm. And you know what I mean? We can't rent 
them. We don't mean that. We mean we want

30:25.187 --> 30:27.651
facilities built. If you want the engineering 
facility to come in, we have to look the part and

30:27.711 --> 30:32.019
play the part. And so we've got real nice 
facilities. The city got it with EDA grant. And the

30:37.409 --> 30:40.514
man in San Antonio gives 20 acres of land. But 
anyway, we turned out to have a big thing. So then

30:43.119 --> 30:45.062
when they redid the hemisphere area, They wanted 
us to get, they wanted us to concentrate on

30:45.498 --> 30:49.264
electronics in that area. So, wow, they built this 
beautiful big building, you know, right there in

30:49.285 --> 30:54.153
the chemistry room. And we had a one 25-year lease, 
and before I left, I got two 25-year lease

30:54.273 --> 31:02.407
extensions, so that's 75 years. But, oh. When we 
put that in, that was our first cylinder. And when I

31:10.513 --> 31:16.461
left that thing, it had about a $2 million in it. So 
then the next thing I went in was North Texas.

31:22.248 --> 31:25.873
And the next cylinder was in the West Texas area 
that was happening. Now all these people were

31:25.893 --> 31:30.619
furnishing us these facilities. And let's see, 
then Houston. We went into the Houston area about

31:33.136 --> 31:36.143
the same time we went into
