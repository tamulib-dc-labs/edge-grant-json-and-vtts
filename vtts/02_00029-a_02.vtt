WEBVTT

00:04.200 --> 00:09.220
Okay, you were giving impressions of Dr. Calhoun. 
My relationship with him started in the early 60s,

00:09.200 --> 00:13.220
and the Department of Commerce, when I was a guest 
at the Department of Commerce, started what they

00:13.200 --> 00:17.220
called an Office of Technical Services, and what 
they would do is they would provide you funding to

00:17.710 --> 00:23.730
answer inquiries from industry in your state. So 
Dr. Calhoun created at that time what he called the

00:23.710 --> 00:33.210
State Technical Services

00:23.710 --> 00:33.210
Institute. He asked me to serve as director of 
that, which I did. And so I had some connection with

00:36.340 --> 00:40.960
him, but the real connection, I guess, comes with 
the Sea Grant Program that I had there. I had quite a

00:43.940 --> 00:48.080
hunk of that Sea Grant Program at one time, and that 
came down there in the late 60s as well, so it had to

00:48.060 --> 00:54.740
be from 6 to 3. And I did a lot of work with the Sea 
Grant Program.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.380
I used my industrial economics staff, which would 
be perfect. It would be all economic studies along

01:05.360 --> 01:10.380
the cone, things of that nature. And... OTS had 
gone out of business, by the way. Office of

01:13.360 --> 01:15.380
Technical Services had gone out of business, so 
then I got in on the Sea Grant Program, and of course

01:15.360 --> 01:19.380
we run all those things. So

01:19.360 --> 01:28.780
that's really the period between 65 and 73 is when I 
got really close. Make believe that I had never

01:28.760 --> 01:31.780
seen John Calhoun. Describe him physically and 
his style of... I wish I had a picture. I could just

01:37.336 --> 01:39.780
give it to you. Dr. Calhoun was... probably

01:40.760 --> 01:51.840
the most diversified, intelligent individual 
that I had. Dr. Calhoun could grasp things

01:51.820 --> 01:57.200
rapidly. He did a lot of reading on these things 
before I come in contact with him or not, but I mean,

02:02.570 --> 02:06.590
he was always very well versed. My experience with 
him was through the State Technical Services and

02:06.570 --> 02:15.810
Sea Grant Program. He was a very easy person to talk 
to. I never had seen Dr. Calhoun. Now, some people

02:25.020 --> 02:26.489
have seen Dr. Calhoun mad. I've never seen him mad. 
Never had in my life. Some

02:28.780 --> 02:37.852
different

02:28.780 --> 02:37.852
things. We attended a lot of conferences 
together. I did a lot of studies.

02:44.360 --> 02:50.380
Then one day out of a clear blue sky in 1973, on a 
Thursday afternoon, I was working away, and I got

02:50.360 --> 02:55.480
this phone call from Dr. Williams. And Dr. 
Williams said, you know, now, I believe I've told

02:55.460 --> 02:58.480
you before, I was having my industrial conference 
start Monday, and I had the governor coming over to

03:00.460 --> 03:05.630
give the welcome address, which I had every year. 
And Dr. Williams said, Jim, I'd like to talk to you

03:05.610 --> 03:08.630
in just a few minutes. And he did. By now, for one or 
two, it was a fine. I went down to his office, and

03:12.360 --> 03:20.060
after about five minutes of shaking hands and 
things, he said, you know, we have a vacancy as

03:20.040 --> 03:24.060
director of the Indian Education Service, and we 
want to create an office for Indian education. And

03:27.040 --> 03:31.040
he said, I'd like for you to head for the office. 
Now, tell me about this man, Jack Williams. Well,

03:34.170 --> 03:39.410
of course, Jack Williams and Dr. Calhoun were very 
close, business-wise. I don't know about

03:39.390 --> 03:41.410
personal-wise, but they were always there. They 
had a lot of respect for each other. So I said, well,

03:45.390 --> 03:47.410
Dr. Williams, I don't know. I didn't even know 
there was a vacancy. I had the job, but I really

03:49.390 --> 03:53.410
enjoyed it. It was getting bigger every day, and it 
was getting more statewide and that, the

03:53.390 --> 03:58.410
recognition. I said, I'd have to think about it a 
little bit. He said, well, do you need anything to

04:03.440 --> 04:05.460
think about? I said, yes. I said, I want a copy of the 
budget. I said, what kind of budget do they have?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.021
Where are their sources of money coming from? He 
got on the phone. So he got on the phone, and he

04:13.090 --> 04:17.550
called Fred Benson, if I'm not mistaken. It might 
have been Calhoun, but he called somebody and told

04:17.530 --> 04:22.860
him he had been dragged in. I'd like you to get some 
budgets up here for the engineering pension

04:22.840 --> 04:29.280
service. And so he told them. How did that happen? 
And so we just did a few minutes. He said, well,

04:34.730 --> 04:40.720
when do you think we can get back together? I said, 
we'll get back together Monday morning. I have all

04:42.700 --> 04:46.060
Saturday and Sunday. We'll get back Monday 
morning. And then we're ready.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.980
Some reason just kept him without it. And I didn't 
get a chance to get them together until about 3

04:55.960 --> 05:00.450
o'clock that afternoon. But I went there, and I 
told him what my problem was. And I had, you know, if

05:02.430 --> 05:06.450
I did anything, you know, if I want to do this, I need 
this. I need this. I need this. I need this. I need

05:09.430 --> 05:10.451
this, this, this. Got down to the bottom line. The 
most important thing, I had to have total control

05:11.430 --> 05:16.040
of all the people in the organization. And I was 
going to be fair with them. I was going to evaluate

05:17.020 --> 05:19.040
each one of them. But if they didn't fit into the 
organization, if I'm going to plan for this, then

05:19.020 --> 05:23.040
we're going to have to find somebody who will fill 
that spot. But anyway, it went on like that. And I

05:26.020 --> 05:27.041
had to listen pretty long. He said, is that all? I 
said, yes, sir. He said, you haven't asked for

05:29.020 --> 05:32.240
nothing. He said, you haven't asked for nothing? 
He said, no. I think he said, you haven't asked for

05:34.220 --> 05:35.241
nothing. You can't get it. And so I said, okay. And I 
couldn't. Oh, yes. In day. In day. In day. In day. In

05:47.757 --> 05:47.960
day. In

05:47.940 --> 05:52.859
day. In day. Oh, I'm quite sure of that. And this was 
in August when he called me in. And I said, well,

05:59.000 --> 06:00.021
that'd be fun. That didn't bother him any. 
Describe the role of the Sponsor. You know, it was

06:08.865 --> 06:18.520
really hard. It was hard.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.981
Describe the extension service when you took 
over. What was it? How big was it? Where was it?

06:29.860 --> 06:31.845
Well, it was in the old American Legion Hall. Bob 
Weitz was before you moved out

06:33.188 --> 06:42.070
there. Do you remember that or was it already down 
when you got here? I don't know. I was here. Do you

06:46.050 --> 06:50.070
remember where the headquarters for Bob Weitz was 
up until just about a year ago? No, I don't. You know

06:52.050 --> 06:55.070
where the Farmer Student Association building is 
now? Uh-huh. It used to be that old wooden building

06:55.962 --> 06:58.070
right across the street. Oh, across the street. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Over there by the

07:00.717 --> 07:02.070
police station. Yeah. Well, I didn't know 
anybody, I didn't know anybody in any of this

07:03.057 --> 07:08.070
except Ernie Winochek. The only reason I knew him, 
he had gone by in some ways. And I had met him through

07:11.976 --> 07:14.070
Buddy Williams. He and Ernie were pretty good 
friends. But he's the only one I knew. And so, when I

07:20.280 --> 07:27.440
took over, they took action at the October board 
meeting. We made the motion, Ms. Wilson seconded

07:27.420 --> 07:33.940
it. This is 7-0. 73? 73. No, 70. Yeah, 73. I took 
over. He said it was 73. But this meeting was in

07:41.260 --> 07:45.170
October before the meeting. And so, when that was 
announced and it came out in the paper and

07:45.150 --> 07:48.170
everything, by the day, well, by the way, not the 
night, you know, that he was approved. The same day

07:51.430 --> 07:54.450
I was approved to direct the Engineering 
Extension Service. His picture's on the front

07:54.430 --> 07:57.450
page of the Eagle on one side and mine's on the 
other. And I just saw when they fixed that monument

07:57.430 --> 08:02.730
or whatever it was. But when I went over to the 
Engineering Extension Service, it had a budget of

08:05.930 --> 08:10.950
about $1.5 million and they had about $50 million. 
Where

08:10.930 --> 08:16.840
were they based? Here. All of them here? Yeah. 
Okay. At

08:20.820 --> 08:25.360
that time. They

08:25.340 --> 08:33.850
were a very, they weren't up-to-date. And it was 
not an area that you could find. They

08:37.080 --> 08:41.880
were taught without lesson plans. They didn't 
have any technical manuals. It's a training

08:47.560 --> 08:50.600
organization. But they had 51 employees in the 
budget. But their budget come. One-third come

08:56.490 --> 08:59.510
from Texas Education Agency. One-third come 
directly from Appropriations. And then they got

09:01.490 --> 09:09.170
one-third of their money from the city. Well, 
you've got to realize the Engineering Extension

09:09.150 --> 09:12.170
Service was an old organization. Most

09:12.150 --> 09:21.920
of the employees were,

09:12.150 --> 09:21.920
you know, first jobs. Anyway, when it was 
announced, they had a Dr. Mansfield. And that was

09:26.590 --> 09:30.040
his final person. But

09:30.020 --> 09:36.150
he had been led to believe, either through himself 
or through Mr. Bearden. See, Mr. Bearden had been

09:36.130 --> 09:39.150
director and he retired. That he was going to be the 
director. Well,

09:41.130 --> 09:48.520
by the way, when I become director. But anyway. And 
all of them. And on the first day after COVID,

09:51.820 --> 10:01.200
December 1st, 1973. I'll stay away from that. July 
5th, went in for her third malignancy surgery. She

10:08.220 --> 10:10.360
was operating from that morning. The first day 
after COVID. So. Two important events. Very

10:13.340 --> 10:14.361
important events. I stayed with my wife. Mm-hmm. I 
was Dr. Calhoun. I don't know who that called. I

10:20.340 --> 10:21.681
knew it was COVID. They knew where I was at. I stayed 
with her. And that

10:26.120 --> 10:37.990
was her third

10:26.120 --> 10:37.990
surgery. So,

10:37.970 --> 10:43.640
after they got through with the surgery. They were 
doing it about five hours. The doctor went and sent

10:45.620 --> 10:56.970
her down

10:45.620 --> 10:56.970
to Houston. Started taking chemotherapy. Now, 
I'm not going to dwell on this. But anyway, after

11:01.380 --> 11:03.400
the third operation. My wife had about all the 
operations she wanted. But anyway, they made an

11:05.380 --> 11:07.400
appointment for me. To go see this doctor down in 
Houston. Hospital in Houston. And I got away at the

11:10.380 --> 11:12.400
appointment at 1.30 in the afternoon. My wife and I 
walked in. And I checked her in. And he shut the

11:15.380 --> 11:16.401
door. And I stayed outside. And about 20 minutes. 
About 15 minutes. He came out. He said, I'm sorry.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.440
He said, your wife won't let me check. He said, 
she's not going to take anything. Remember? He

11:25.880 --> 11:26.630
said, unless I get to examine her. He said, it's 
nothing. We went in. He said, come on in. I said,

11:30.270 --> 11:31.291
don't press that. And I said, are you sure you made 
up your mind? He said, yup. I said, how much do I owe

11:34.860 --> 11:36.001
you? He said, $35. I wrote him a check. And that was 
in 1973. But going back to the same thing. I was in

11:40.900 --> 11:41.921
the hospital. I was in the hospital. I was in the 
hospital. I was in the hospital. Where did

11:44.900 --> 12:00.350
primarily geographically, where did, when you 
took over, where were they doing the instruction

12:00.330 --> 12:02.450
that they were? They were going out in motels. No, 
but where was it? Was it in the Houston area? Oh, it

12:07.990 --> 12:09.890
was all over the state. But it wasn't concentrated 
in one? No. No. And they had lineman training and

12:14.470 --> 12:17.490
things of this nature. They did a lot of training 
for Texas television. Association. See, they

12:21.634 --> 12:23.230
were getting subsidized. Right.

12:26.335 --> 12:28.230
Give more examples of that. Okay, law 
enforcement, water and wastewater. Fireman

12:32.990 --> 12:46.560
Training

12:32.990 --> 12:46.560
Center was all part of that? But they used 
volunteer instructors. They only had four

12:52.094 --> 12:58.770
people.

12:58.750 --> 13:04.770
Was there one client that was by far the key one, the 
biggest? Well, the Rural Electric Co-op, of

13:04.750 --> 13:08.800
course, the organization was so small, they only 
had... I'll put this thing

13:12.186 --> 13:31.600
in

13:12.186 --> 13:31.600
perspective.

13:31.580 --> 13:35.449
Now, wait. Give me those

13:35.650 --> 13:44.250
numbers again. When I took over, it was around 51, I 
think, employees. We had a $39

13:48.230 --> 13:59.040
million

13:48.230 --> 13:59.040
budget. And of that budget, how much did y'all... 
Ten percent. We got $3 million and something in

14:02.816 --> 14:04.040
general. The rest you brought in. When you started 
out, you were primarily serving small-town

14:07.580 --> 14:14.600
needs, and

14:14.580 --> 14:22.640
the telephone companies were the... The Rural, 
uh-huh. All right, let's see. When you took over,

14:27.650 --> 14:33.670
were there any key office staff members that you 
came to rely on? I'm talking about the people in the

14:37.650 --> 14:40.760
office. I tell you, Dr. Mansfield was a fine 
person, and there must have been a shock to his

14:47.660 --> 14:49.990
system. He had a different...

14:49.970 --> 14:59.210
His philosophy and my philosophy was just 
completely 100% different. I was used to the soft

15:01.190 --> 15:03.210
money operation. I've always had the soft money. 
They

15:04.190 --> 15:11.670
didn't like it. That's their job. But then another 
thing I asked Dr. Williams was... I never

15:19.060 --> 15:33.000
did go down to that, but I was up on the eighth floor. 
Of the Rudder Tower? Yeah. That was my

15:36.114 --> 15:39.960
headquarters. All right, when you took over, in 
terms of reporting, you reported to... Dr.

15:45.940 --> 15:48.087
Calhoun.

15:50.576 --> 15:57.460
In which order?

15:57.440 --> 16:01.480
All right, on paper, was it to Benson, or was it to 
both on paper? Both of them. Okay. You see, I got

16:06.090 --> 16:09.210
funding from community education. All right, 
let's go back and talk about this man, Benson. He's

16:13.190 --> 16:16.210
a Kansan, I think, didn't he come? That's right. 
Kansas State, and his... Tell me about his working

16:19.190 --> 16:24.210
style and so forth. He

16:24.190 --> 16:34.130
never did leave.

16:34.110 --> 16:35.131
He walked out. He wasn't a bit bashful to pick it up 
and say, Jim, what's this I hear about

16:37.360 --> 16:49.070
so-and-so's?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.070
We had our ground rules set. I set my ground rules 
with him. He told me to inform you or something.

16:58.420 --> 17:00.440
Give me some guidelines. Because I don't have time 
to tell you everything I do, and you don't have time

17:03.420 --> 17:05.810
to listen to everything I do. Give me your 
guidelines. You know what Mr. Benson's answer was

17:07.580 --> 17:09.600
then? Keep me informed on the matters you think 
that I could have some input on. Not

17:14.580 --> 17:21.010
that, you know, I just never had a reason. And I can 
say the same thing about Calhoun. All right, now,

17:22.990 --> 17:28.010
officially, the Extension, Engineering 
Extension Service was part of the... of the Texas

17:32.210 --> 17:37.280
A&M University and of the system. No, the 
Engineering Extension Service was always a part

17:37.260 --> 17:41.370
of the system. All right. During those years with 
Williams and Calhoun and Benson, did it matter,

17:48.660 --> 17:51.680
system or campus? Did it matter? And how you 
operated? It mattered because I knew exactly what

17:54.840 --> 17:59.000
the system was supposed to do. I knew the policies 
and procedures of the system. And I knew what the

18:00.980 --> 18:03.000
university was supposed to do. I knew what I was 
expected of me in the university. I knew exactly

18:04.980 --> 18:07.640
what I was expected of me in the university. When 
you wanted to communicate with them, whom did you

18:10.620 --> 18:14.640
have to go through to get to Calhoun or to Benson? 
Nobody except their secretary. They all, you

18:17.500 --> 18:22.220
always, he had the same, they had the same thing 
with me. All

18:22.200 --> 18:25.512
right. As

18:25.773 --> 18:33.040
you think back on those first years, what were some 
key decisions that were made by you or anybody

18:33.020 --> 18:38.040
else? Pertaining to the system? Or pertaining to 
the work of the... Of the Extension, of the

18:41.360 --> 18:44.380
Extension, of the... Engineering Extension 
Service? Well,

18:46.360 --> 18:51.640
I'm not being derogatory, but I'll make the roll. I 
had, you know, the rest of them was all non-degree.

19:04.140 --> 19:07.760
They had one title. It was all called...

19:13.980 --> 19:18.000
My first thing that I did when I went in there, by 
January the 1st, I had a, I even, I had

19:17.980 --> 19:32.700
no pay rings.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.700
Everybody made the same. So

19:34.680 --> 19:43.250
the

19:34.680 --> 19:43.250
first thing we did, we gave them something to... 
And then in February of that year, I had a meeting in

19:43.230 --> 19:46.520
Wyandale to give them a copy of what I call 
Management

19:46.500 --> 19:55.830
by Objective, and how we was going to run the 
Engineering Extension Service and what part they

19:57.810 --> 20:05.960
was going

19:57.810 --> 20:05.960
to play. But anyway, there was a few... You've got 
to remember, this was an old organization. They'd

20:13.610 --> 20:15.630
all been in together. Here's a damn stranger. But 
anyway, after we had that meeting, none of them

20:20.750 --> 20:24.690
understood Management at all. They didn't know 
what Management by Objective was. But anyway, we

20:28.900 --> 20:33.100
started putting that thing together. I come into a 
recommendation with Dr. Williams, Fred Benson,

20:42.720 --> 20:52.740
they had about, I'd say they had about $500,000. 
We'd

20:56.260 --> 21:03.520
automatically, if they had the qualifications, 
they'd go into this pay status, find somebody that

21:03.500 --> 21:10.000
had the qualifications. But we'd give them each 
title, training specialist.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.200
Well, it was about key decisions. Okay. That's how 
the decisions were made. And then once we got that

21:27.180 --> 21:29.200
thing in line, and unfortunately, poor old Gotham 
fans knew it, but he didn't

21:32.180 --> 21:56.920
buy that

21:32.180 --> 21:56.920
certain phase, whatever you want to call it, out. 
And I brought in a new man as associate director. I

21:58.900 --> 22:00.980
brought in Milt Radke, right off. He was a young 
engineer. And how do you spell his last name?

22:04.980 --> 22:08.523
Radke,

22:04.980 --> 22:08.523
R-A-D-K. He was a TTI. And how did he come about 
being in us? TTI was getting into public work

22:13.200 --> 22:15.220
training. Well, I had created a center for public 
work. And I picked up the paper one Saturday

22:19.500 --> 22:21.520
morning. There was TTI announcing they were 
public work training. So I got a hold of Fred. I

22:27.800 --> 22:31.800
said, Fred, we've got a problem. He said, what's 
the problem? I told him, I'll take care of that

22:32.780 --> 22:35.200
Monday morning. We had Jack Keese in. In all fact, 
you can get out of public work. That's an extension

22:41.870 --> 22:43.890
I kicked in. That's not a research activity. And so 
Milt and Radke was in that position. We

22:48.900 --> 22:53.510
transferred him and one other TTI staff member, 
their whole team. And it turned out that Milt was a

22:54.490 --> 22:59.610
very, he's a very good engineer and a very smart 
individual and a very, very good writer. So I

23:02.590 --> 23:07.200
brought him on as associate director. Well, that 
made all the rest of them. I didn't do it by all. He's

23:10.180 --> 23:11.201
there a year, a year and a half. You know, I'm 
serving him for a time. But that's how that got

23:13.180 --> 23:16.250
started. But when you have to have a decision made, 
it took me less than five minutes to get it. I could

23:22.230 --> 23:23.251
call Benson. He'd say, well, what did you do? Or 
what do you want to do? Or I could call Calhoun.

23:27.230 --> 23:30.560
Calhoun wasn't as quick on the draw as Benson was, 
but he was still very quick. You know what I mean? I

23:33.540 --> 23:35.560
mean, I'd have more conversation with Calhoun 
than I would with Benson. I mean, it's a good thing.

23:41.940 --> 23:43.960
Did you ever get the impression that, either one of 
them ever made a snap judgment without thinking it

23:45.940 --> 23:47.960
through? I'm sure there are quite a few of us. I 
think everybody that's done that. Let's see. Back

23:54.772 --> 23:57.580
to other decisions. Because you're in charge for 
19 years, 73 to 92. Other decisions that you now

24:04.000 --> 24:07.020
look back on and say, those were key decisions we 
made. Well, one key decision we made, we

24:13.000 --> 24:20.220
had a reputation. And again, it's not something 
they should never talk about. But mind you, at the

24:25.090 --> 24:28.860
time of thefast election, it was a special 
election. It's a waste of time.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.780
And so every board member on the board was putting 
an effort to support that. They were calling on the

24:42.740 --> 24:44.760
state to find, I could contact every legislator 
with one phone call. So I said, that's our fate. So

24:49.740 --> 24:50.761
the first thing I did, I put about $150,000 in our 
department. We don't have any training aids out

24:53.740 --> 24:57.360
there or exhibits. Okay, what is electronics?

25:01.528 --> 25:07.480
But I had a man in electronics.

25:07.521 --> 25:17.200
All these people I was telling you were fine 
people, and that wasn't the problem was with them.

25:17.180 --> 25:20.200
So I replaced him right off with Dr. Lloyd Fite. 
F-I-T-E. He would

25:22.623 --> 25:30.094
already call me up one day. I took Lloyd over,

25:30.354 --> 25:40.809
and it was half-time. We'd done this thing, and 
that was in February. It was half-time. It was

25:48.340 --> 25:49.447
September 1st. He'd been a little sold out, and we 
had it out to greet him. And so we then started

25:53.330 --> 25:59.290
getting pretty heavy on electronics, and we got 
that thing built up. We had a gentleman and me in the

25:59.270 --> 26:04.542
auto office. That was one time, and the same 
gentleman was over at the electric co-op training

26:04.582 --> 26:12.120
and the Texas Telephone Association training. 
When he retired, I saw that was my strength

26:12.100 --> 26:18.250
coverage. And in the meantime, I got to be very, 
very well. And they

26:20.957 --> 26:30.320
were lobbying for me. The rural electric co-ops 
would take the engineering and maintenance

26:30.300 --> 26:36.870
service with their lobbyists. Same thing with the 
Texas Telephone Association. That's what drove

26:41.098 --> 26:43.030
everything. And you're not rural electric, but 
you've got others. So we'd start timing, and then

26:46.010 --> 26:47.031
we'd keep going. We'd start tying in with several 
others. We got all their training materials.

26:51.800 --> 26:56.120
They'd give me everything, their training 
materials. But at that time, see, not a lot of

26:56.100 --> 26:59.970
people had nothing. So we got that from the 
telephone training. Then we started getting the

27:04.280 --> 27:08.250
powertrain, electric power. The rural electric 
co-op didn't have any, but Houston Light and Fire

27:08.230 --> 27:12.250
at that time had plenty. Texas, the big one that 
really helped me out on my electric training was

27:12.230 --> 27:16.560
Texas Fire and Light. So

27:16.540 --> 27:23.170
that's how we built the thing. And then after, you 
know, we were driving real fast. And if they had no

27:26.650 --> 27:34.440
growth potential, we'd maybe ought to take them 
out, which we did. We did away with three or four

27:34.420 --> 27:36.440
divisions. What were they? They

27:37.420 --> 27:46.350
were always one-man operations. We

27:46.330 --> 27:53.080
had, well, one thing we did, fire was half 
hazardous material. And I took that directly

27:53.060 --> 27:54.081
away. It started a hazardous system. But Al 
Sterling, the very fine guy,

27:58.420 --> 28:08.350
had his master's degree from MIT. When he retired, 
we brought him up here. We broke the divisions off

28:11.860 --> 28:14.880
and put that under fire. We did the same thing with, 
with management training. We used to have, we used

28:20.380 --> 28:23.590
to have two levels of management training. This 
was a very bold level. Then we just started moving

28:27.420 --> 28:30.870
to a higher level. It was a supervisor training. So 
we had to let, so I let that lower division just go.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.200
We just started what I call supervisor training. 
And I'm sure there's five or six others, but I'm

28:38.180 --> 28:43.600
right off hand. I don't remember them all. But we 
ended up, we started out, we had five divisions. We

28:47.580 --> 28:49.600
ended up with 17. Our

28:49.580 --> 28:54.720
staff, the professionals first, is we supported 
them. We were about, see now that staff first had to

28:54.700 --> 29:02.470
do a lot of work while those people were traveling 
all over the state of Texas. And they had to have

29:05.450 --> 29:07.520
strong staff people. But it was about four of them 
or something. Where, in the areas where you all

29:10.260 --> 29:13.430
worked, in what area, what work area, subject 
area, was it easiest to raise money, and which one

29:18.850 --> 29:21.870
was most difficult to support? Well, it was all, 
there was no difference. Let me just tell you why.

29:26.410 --> 29:29.430
We started Simmons about ten years after I got 
there. About in 78, 79, I put in my first center in

29:29.410 --> 29:33.580
San Antonio. It was called South Central Texas 
Regional Training Center. And at that time, Henry

29:35.560 --> 29:40.640
Cisneros was on the city council, and then Lenny 
made the merits. They had a program over there

29:43.760 --> 29:48.880
under the junior college, and they were totally 
unhappy with the city funding. And they were

29:50.860 --> 29:52.940
totally unhappy with it. So the guy, the president 
of the junior college over there, Mr. Dr. Wheeler,

29:55.920 --> 29:58.940
so they asked me to take it over. I said, you know 
what, I'll go talk to him. Well, I'll go talk to him.

30:04.380 --> 30:06.400
And he was happy as a lark to get it to me. I said, I 
can't get along with him. But anyway, he had about a

30:08.910 --> 30:12.930
$300,000 a year program with him. And so then when 
we took over South Central Region Training

30:12.910 --> 30:15.930
Center, he was like, give us, you know, whenever I 
did anything like that, you know, I'll give

30:18.450 --> 30:20.470
everyone what they need. You've got to provide me 
facilities. I mean, we can't rent them. We don't

30:25.080 --> 30:26.101
mean that. We mean we want facilities built. If you 
want these things to come in, we have to look the

30:30.080 --> 30:32.100
part and play the part. And so we got real nice 
facilities. We got the EDA grant. And the man in San

30:37.080 --> 30:41.100
Antonio gives 20 acres of land to build it on. But 
anyway, we turned out to have a big thing. So then

30:43.080 --> 30:45.100
when they redid the hemisphere area, they wanted 
us to concentrate on electronics in that area. So

30:49.080 --> 30:51.100
they built this beautiful big building, you know, 
right there in the chemistry area. And we had a one

30:53.080 --> 30:56.100
25-year lease. And before I left, I got two 25-year 
leases for 75 years. But when we put that in, that

31:02.260 --> 31:08.440
was our first cylinder. When I left, that thing had 
about a $2 million in it. So then the next thing I

31:13.720 --> 31:17.970
went in was North Texas, in Arlington. We went all 
over Arlington. And the next cylinder was in the

31:21.200 --> 31:23.950
West Texas area. That was Adelaide. Now, all these 
people were purchasing us these facilities. You

31:28.110 --> 31:32.170
can just see, then Houston. We went into the 
Houston area about the same time we went into

31:32.150 --> 31:36.170
Arlington.
