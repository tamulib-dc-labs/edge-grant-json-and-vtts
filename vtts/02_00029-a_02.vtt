WEBVTT

00:04.655 --> 00:08.742
Okay, you were giving impressions of Dr. Calhoun. 
My relationship with him started in the early 60s.

00:11.726 --> 00:18.297
The Department of Commerce, when I was a guest, the 
Department of Commerce started what they called

00:11.726 --> 00:18.297
an Office of Technical Services, MTS. And what 
they would do is they would provide you funding to

00:18.317 --> 00:24.587
answer inquiries from industry in your state. So 
Dr. Calhoun created at that time what he called the

00:24.607 --> 00:31.979
State Technical Services Institute. And... He 
asked me to serve as director of that, which I did.

00:38.084 --> 00:39.746
And so I had some connection with them. But the real 
connection, I guess, come with the Sea Grant

00:39.867 --> 00:43.812
program down there. I had quite a hunk of that Sea 
Grant program at one time. And that come down there

00:49.699 --> 00:53.344
in the late 60s as well, if I remember. It had to be 
before 73. And I did a lot of work with the Sea Grant

00:54.565 --> 01:00.092
program.

01:01.827 --> 01:04.070
because I used my industrial economics staff. 
It's been perfect. It'll be all economic studies

01:05.112 --> 01:11.742
along the code and things of that nature. And OTS 
had gone out of business, by the way.

01:13.845 --> 01:19.233
Off-technical services had gone out of business. 
So then I got in on the CGRAT program, and we went all

01:19.253 --> 01:22.638
over. So that's really the period between 65 and 73 
is when I got well-acquainted. make believe that I

01:28.827 --> 01:35.956
had never seen John Calhoun, describe him 
physically and his style. I wish I had a picture. I

01:37.358 --> 01:39.681
could just give it to you. Dr. Calhoun was probably

01:39.941 --> 01:54.439
the best, the most diversified, intelligent 
individual that I have ever met in my life. Dr.

01:54.459 --> 01:58.564
Calhoun could grasp things rapidly. I don't know 
whether he did a lot of reading on these things

01:59.017 --> 02:06.606
before I come in contact with him or not, but I mean, 
he was always very well versed.

02:08.789 --> 02:16.538
My experience with him was through the State 
Technical Institute and through the Sea Grant

02:08.789 --> 02:16.538
program. And I always felt that Dr. Calvin was a 
very easy person to talk to. I never have seen Dr.

02:23.567 --> 02:26.631
Now, some people have seen Dr. Calvin mad. I've 
never seen him mad. Never had in my life.

02:33.009 --> 02:37.876
But we've come pretty close doing those years on 
different things. We attended a lot of

02:37.896 --> 02:40.139
conferences together. I did a lot of studies. And 
then one day out of the clear blue sky in 1973, on a

02:42.863 --> 02:53.779
Thursday afternoon, I was working away, and I got 
this phone call from Dr. Whitman. And Dr. Williams

02:55.447 --> 03:05.817
said, you know, now, I believe I told you before, I 
was having my industrial conference start

02:55.447 --> 03:05.817
Monday, and I had the governor coming over to get 
the welcome of press, which I had every year. And

03:05.897 --> 03:09.701
Dr. Williams said, Jim, I'd like to spend a few 
minutes with you. And I said, well, that's fine. I

03:12.483 --> 03:24.475
went on down to his office, and after about five 
minutes of shaking hands, I think he said, you

03:12.483 --> 03:24.475
know, we have a vacancy as director of the 
engineering thinking service. that we want to

03:24.590 --> 03:28.796
create an office of continuing education. And he 
said, I'd like for you to get those folks. Now, tell

03:31.981 --> 03:34.084
me about this man, Jack Williams. Well, of course, 
Jack Williams and Dr. Calhoun were very close. I

03:39.493 --> 03:42.477
mean, business-wise, I don't know about 
personal-wise, but they were always there. They

03:42.497 --> 03:45.101
had a lot of respect for each other. So I said, well, 
Dr. Williams, I don't know. I didn't even know them

03:48.306 --> 03:51.090
as a thing. I had a job that I really enjoyed. 
getting bigger every day and getting more

03:53.446 --> 04:20.584
statewide and that the recognition i said i i'd 
have to think about a little bit he said well what do

03:53.446 --> 04:20.584
you do you need anything to think about i said yes i 
said i want to talk to you about it i said i want to see

03:53.446 --> 04:20.584
what kind of budget they have where their sources 
of money is coming from so he got on the phone and he

03:53.446 --> 04:20.584
called fred benson if i'm not mistaken it might 
have been calvin but he called somebody And Tony

04:21.391 --> 04:30.204
had been back in office and he said, I'd like you to 
get some money so I can put in some pension for you.

04:30.665 --> 04:31.526
And so he's done. How did that happen? And so we just 
did a few minutes. He said, well,

04:35.312 --> 04:41.320
when do you think we can get back together? And I 
said, we'll get back together Monday morning. I

04:44.325 --> 04:46.568
said, I have all Saturday and Sunday. We'll get 
back Monday morning. So he said, well, just give me

04:49.012 --> 04:51.195
a ring Monday morning when you're ready. And I did. 
Some really miscalculated about it, and I didn't

04:54.147 --> 05:00.593
get to do it until, we spent it together until about 
3 o'clock that afternoon. But I went there, and I

05:00.613 --> 05:09.401
told him what my problem was, and I had, you know, if 
I could do anything, you know, if I want to do this, I

05:00.613 --> 05:09.401
need this, I need this, I need this, I need this, I 
need this, this, this. Got down to the bottom line,

05:10.242 --> 05:15.747
the most important thing, I had to have total 
control of all the people in the organization. And

05:15.767 --> 05:18.550
if I was going to be fair with them, if I was going to 
evaluate each one of them, But if they didn't fit

05:19.103 --> 05:24.748
into the organization, if I'm going to plan for 
this, then we're going to have to find somebody

05:19.103 --> 05:24.748
that will fill that spot. But anyway, it went on 
like that. And I had to listen pretty long. When I

05:30.173 --> 05:32.515
got through, he said, is that all? I said, yes, sir. 
He said, you haven't asked for nothing. He said,

05:37.139 --> 05:38.541
you haven't asked for nothing. He said, no, I think 
he said, you haven't asked for nothing. You can't

05:40.262 --> 05:41.863
get it. And so I said, OK. So then he called Fred 
Benson in California and told him that I'd

05:43.385 --> 05:49.110
accepted his job. As

05:49.664 --> 05:58.939
far as you know, he had talked with each of them in 
depth. Oh, yes. Oh, I'm quite sure of that. I mean,

06:01.223 --> 06:11.020
Pastor Williams would have done... No, and 
another thing I had, see, I had a lot of research

06:01.223 --> 06:11.020
projects in that industry, in industrial 
economics research, and this was in August when he

06:01.223 --> 06:11.020
called me in. And I told him, I said, I couldn't 
possibly accept a job full of these people.

06:15.179 --> 06:18.162
Because I had sponsors out here that supported me 
for years. I said, well, that'd be fun. That didn't

06:21.125 --> 06:21.985
bother any of them. Describe the extension 
service when you took over. What was it? How big was

06:28.031 --> 06:28.812
it? Where was it? Well, it was in the old American 
Legion Hall.

06:34.858 --> 06:36.900
Bob White was before he moved out there. That used 
to be just an old building there. Do you remember

06:41.960 --> 06:44.083
that or was it already down when you got here? I 
don't know. Do you remember where the

06:45.925 --> 06:52.213
headquarters of Bob White's was until just about a 
year ago? No. Well, you know where the Farmer

06:52.353 --> 06:55.397
Student Association building is now? It used to be 
that old wooden building right across the street.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.642
Oh, across the street. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over 
there by the police station. Yeah. Well, I didn't

07:03.086 --> 07:04.508
know anybody I didn't know anybody in Indian 
Peninsula except Ernie Winochek. The only reason

07:08.415 --> 07:11.058
I knew him, he had more of my in some ways. And I had 
met him through Buddy Williams. And Buddy

07:14.483 --> 07:18.709
Williams, you know, he and Ernie were pretty good 
friends. But he's the only one I knew. And so when I

07:20.511 --> 07:29.443
took over, they took action at the October 4th 
meeting. We'd all been made to motion, Ms. Wilson

07:29.463 --> 07:31.626
seconded. This is 73? 73. No, 70. Yes, 73. I forgot 
the code. He said the first 73. But this meeting was

07:41.370 --> 07:43.292
in October before the meeting. And so when that was 
announced, it would come out in the paper, and by

07:45.094 --> 07:54.085
the day, well, by the way, not the night, you know, 
the dean of medicine was approved the same day I was

07:45.094 --> 07:54.085
approved. His picture's on the front page of the 
eagle on one side and mine's on the other. And I just

07:58.070 --> 08:02.035
saw what they fixed, that monument or whatever it 
was. But when I went over to the Engineering

08:02.943 --> 08:15.755
Extension Service, it had a budget of about $1.5 
million, and they had about $50 million. Where

08:15.915 --> 08:17.536
were they based? All of them here? Yeah, at that 
time.

08:24.763 --> 08:31.549
They were a very,

08:24.763 --> 08:31.549
I'm not going to say the group, but it's true. They 
weren't up-to-date. There was not an area that you

08:34.863 --> 08:39.308
could find that they were up-to-date on. They 
taught without lesson plans. They didn't have any

08:44.254 --> 08:48.860
technical manuals.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.863
It's a training organization. But they have 51 
employees and a little over about a million and a

08:50.883 --> 08:55.929
half dollars budget. But their budget, one-third 
come from Texas Education Agency. One third comes

08:59.795 --> 09:06.662
directly from Appropriations, and then you've 
got one third of the money from the Seeders. And

09:06.682 --> 09:09.184
that was a third, third, and third. Well, you've 
got to realize, the Engineer Potential Service

09:09.204 --> 09:12.448
was an overarching section. And most of the 
employers were in there since their first job.

09:22.397 --> 09:28.063
Anyway, when it was announced, they had a Dr. 
Mansfield, who was a social director. And Deb was

09:29.056 --> 09:32.820
the final person that you ever want to meet 
tomorrow. But he had been led to believe, either

09:32.840 --> 09:40.768
through himself or through Mr. Bearden, see, Mr. 
Bearden had been director and he retired, that he

09:32.840 --> 09:40.768
was going to be the director. Well, by the way, when 
I become director, I'm going to be the director.

09:48.697 --> 09:56.785
But anyway, and all of them in the engine and engine 
service was shocked that he didn't get it. So the

09:57.558 --> 10:05.506
first day I took over, December 1st, 1973, I stayed 
away from her until I took over. My wife went in for

10:05.526 --> 10:09.150
her third malignancy surgery. She was operating 
from that morning, the first day I took over. Two

10:12.233 --> 10:13.914
important events. Very important events. I 
stayed with my wife. I called Dr. Cowan. I don't

10:19.460 --> 10:20.501
know who I called. I don't know who I called. But 
anyway, they knew where I was at. And I stayed with

10:24.645 --> 10:26.687
her. call that day, and we were talking to Quade, 
and we had a doctor out of Houston come up, and that

10:28.726 --> 10:41.338
was our third

10:28.726 --> 10:41.338
surgery, third emergency surgery. So after they 
got through with the surgery, it was in about five

10:41.358 --> 10:56.252
hours, Dr. Quade came up and told me, he said, yeah, 
he said, I don't have much hope for you, and he said

10:41.358 --> 10:56.252
that, he said that we're going to Send her down to 
Houston, start taking chemotherapy. No, I'm not

11:01.055 --> 11:02.076
going to dwell on this. Anyway, after the third 
operation, my wife had about all the operations

11:02.096 --> 11:05.880
she wanted. But anyway, they made an appointment 
for me to go see this doctor down at the hospital in

11:05.900 --> 11:10.685
Houston. And I got away at the point. It was 1.30 in 
the afternoon. My wife and I walked in. And I

11:14.889 --> 11:16.191
checked in. He shut the door. I stayed outside. And 
about 20 minutes, or 15 minutes, he come out and

11:19.114 --> 11:23.879
said, I'm sorry. He said, your wife won't let me 
touch you. He said, she's not going to take him up

11:25.628 --> 11:28.952
there. And he said, unless I get the exam, they said 
he's not going to take him. So we went in. He said,

11:34.199 --> 11:34.900
come on in. So I told Francis that. And I said, are 
you sure you made up your mind? He said, yep. I said,

11:40.106 --> 11:42.128
how much did it all cost? He said, $35. I wrote him a 
check. And that was in 1973. Can you imagine

11:46.093 --> 11:52.301
that? But going back to St. James's. Where did, 
primarily geographically, where did, when you

11:54.535 --> 12:02.583
took over, where were they doing the instruction 
that they were? They were going out in motels. No,

12:04.345 --> 12:05.786
no, but where was it? Was it in the Houston area? Oh, 
it was all over the state. But it wasn't

12:09.810 --> 12:11.492
concentrated in one? No, no. Okay. No, no. See, 
they was doing all the training for rural electric

12:12.974 --> 12:17.899
co-ops, and their linemen training and things of 
this nature. They did a lot of training for the

12:17.919 --> 12:21.502
Texas Telephone Association. But see, they were 
getting sucked to die. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Right.

12:24.691 --> 12:28.016
Give more examples of that. Okay. Law 
enforcement, all the state and law enforcement,

12:28.757 --> 12:32.903
water and wastewater. They did all the training 
for water and wastewater in the cities. Of course,

12:36.789 --> 12:39.513
we had the fire protection. We had the extension 
part of it, and then we had the fire. Fireman

12:44.080 --> 12:46.123
Training Center was all part of that? Oh, yeah. 
That was the biggest part. But they used volunteer

12:49.970 --> 12:51.812
instructors. They only had four people on the 
full-time staff at the farm. Then they'd go to

12:54.934 --> 12:58.958
town, they'd just get somebody at the farm to 
volunteer. Was there one client that was by far the

12:58.978 --> 13:03.782
key one, the biggest? Was there? Well, your rural 
electric co-op, of course, the organization was

13:04.943 --> 13:14.911
so small, they only had 50, 55 people. But the rural 
electric co-ops and the Texas Telephone

13:15.091 --> 13:19.555
Association and the water departments of the 
cities and the law enforcement and the law, those

13:20.243 --> 13:28.556
were your, it was all side of the budget. But to kind 
of put this thing in perspective, when I left there

13:29.598 --> 13:39.754
we had 400 employees and a $39 million budget and 
was only getting $3 million in general revenue.

13:39.774 --> 13:41.817
$36 million was coming in fees and contracts. Now 
wait, give me those numbers again. When I took over

13:44.902 --> 13:45.964
it was Around 51, I think, employees. And I left on 
December, I mean, on January the 31st, 1992. We had

13:55.122 --> 13:57.325
a $39 million budget. And of that budget, how much 
did y'all...

14:04.956 --> 14:05.857
The rest you brought in. All right. When you 
started out, you were primarily serving

14:08.921 --> 14:14.449
small-town needs... Rural areas and city water 
departments in your small town, city water

14:15.020 --> 14:20.446
departments, small town lawns. And the telephone 
companies were the co-ops. All right, let's see.

14:28.055 --> 14:38.047
When you took over, were there any key office staff 
members that you came to rely on? I'm talking about

14:39.128 --> 14:40.990
the people in the office. I lined them up real fast. 
I had to bring him in. As I told you, Dr. Mansfield

14:46.360 --> 14:52.988
was a fine person, and there must have been a shock 
to his system, because he had never heard of me. And

14:53.008 --> 14:57.492
of course, he just never would. Well, he had a 
different philosophy. His philosophy and my

14:58.854 --> 15:01.597
philosophy was completely 100% different. I was 
used to the soft money operations. I've always had

15:03.459 --> 15:05.521
the soft money operations. I liked it. It gave me a 
lot of latitude. They didn't like it. It was a

15:10.787 --> 15:13.410
threat to their jobs. All

15:13.778 --> 15:18.565
right.

15:25.995 --> 15:42.418
When

15:25.995 --> 15:42.418
you took over, In terms of reporting, you reported 
to? Dr. Calhoun and Fred Benson. In which order?

15:52.670 --> 15:57.157
All three of us worked very well. All right. On 
paper, was it to Benson, or was it to both on paper?

16:03.225 --> 16:03.585
Both of them. Okay. See, I got funding from Indian 
Education, Texas Indian University. All right,

16:09.027 --> 16:12.711
let's go back and talk about this man Benson. He's a 
Kinson, I think, didn't he come, Kent State, and

16:12.811 --> 16:23.962
tell me about his working style and so forth. Well, 
you never did leave a meeting with Fred Benson that

16:25.503 --> 16:32.470
you didn't know where he stood. He walked up, he 
went a bit bashful to pick up the phone and said,

16:34.052 --> 16:39.017
Jim, what's this I hear about so-and-so's? It 
explained it to him. That was the end of it, I guess,

16:42.462 --> 16:46.005
for me at all. You know, we had our ground rules set. 
I set my ground rules with him, and he said, Calvin,

16:50.729 --> 16:54.412
what do you expect? What kind of report do you want? 
What kind of, when do you want me to inform you of

16:56.214 --> 16:59.176
something? Give me some guidelines, because I 
don't have time to tell you everything I do, and you

16:59.196 --> 17:06.783
don't have time to listen to everything I do. Give 
me your guidelines. You know what Mr. Benson's

17:07.904 --> 17:09.325
answer was to that? keep me informed on the matter 
you think that I could have some input on. I never

17:15.392 --> 17:17.815
called you. Not that, you know, I just never had a 
reason. I can say the same thing about Cal State.

17:22.681 --> 17:37.039
All right, now, officially, the Extension, the 
Extension, Engineering Extension Service was

17:22.681 --> 17:37.039
part of the Texas A&M University and of the system. 
No, Engineering Extension Service was always a

17:39.916 --> 17:41.758
part of the system. All right. During those years 
with Williams and Calhoun and Benson, did it

17:42.419 --> 17:51.128
matter, system or campus? Did it matter? And how 
you operated? Not with me. It didn't matter

17:56.274 --> 17:58.597
because I knew exactly what the system was 
supposed to do. I knew the policies and procedures

17:58.637 --> 18:00.238
of the system. And I knew what the university was 
supposed to do. And I knew exactly what I was

18:02.361 --> 18:04.703
expected of me in the university. And I knew 
exactly what I was expected of me in the

18:04.723 --> 18:07.206
university. When you wanted to communicate with 
them whom did you have to go through to get to

18:10.274 --> 18:14.718
Calhoun or to Benson? Nobody except their 
secretary. They all, you always, he had the same,

18:17.842 --> 18:22.066
they had the same thing with me. I mean, we never, I 
never had one minute that I ever talked. All right,

18:26.991 --> 18:37.702
as you think back on those first years, what were 
some key decisions that were made by you or anybody

18:26.991 --> 18:37.702
else? Retain to the system. or pertaining to the 
work of the of the extension of the extension of the

18:39.805 --> 19:09.525
well

18:39.805 --> 19:09.525
I'm not being derogatory but I make this statement 
but I had to have people that would grow I had you

18:39.805 --> 19:09.525
know I had maybe two people with college degrees 
Dr. Mansfield had a degree and then mine had one or

18:39.805 --> 19:09.525
two others the rest of them was all non-degree 
people they had one title it was all called

19:10.231 --> 19:12.654
instructors.

19:13.756 --> 19:22.509
So my first thing that I did when I went in there, by 
January the 1st, I had a study conducted on what

19:13.756 --> 19:22.509
their title should be. I had told me exactly what 
their qualifications should be as far as

19:23.109 --> 19:30.720
education, experience, everything. And I even, I 
had no pay range. Everybody made the same. If

19:34.245 --> 19:37.851
you're an instructor, you make the same. Or give or 
take $10,000. But So the first thing we did, we'd

19:40.201 --> 19:48.910
give them something to, and then in February of 
that year, I had a meeting in Rondeal with the whole

19:40.201 --> 19:48.910
staff. Day and a half, two days meeting. At which 
time I'd give them a copy of what I call management

19:52.233 --> 20:03.045
biotech, and how we was gonna run the engineering 
and maintenance services, what part they was

19:52.233 --> 20:03.045
gonna play, what was expected of them, and so forth 
and so on. And that didn't go too well then. But

20:05.888 --> 20:09.111
anyway, there was a few You know, they really 
didn't touch it. But you've got to remember, this

20:11.717 --> 20:13.680
was an old organization. They'd all been in 
together. Here's a damn stranger. But anyway,

20:18.706 --> 20:24.654
after we had that meeting, and none of them 
understood management at all. They didn't know

20:24.774 --> 20:26.176
what management by objective was. They didn't, 
you know, it had never been as fun. But anyway, when

20:29.080 --> 20:38.052
we started putting that thing together, and then 
on June the 1st, I come into a recommendation with

20:29.080 --> 20:38.052
Dr. Williams, This is for the engineer retention 
service. The recommendation of Dr. Wigg, she's

20:40.818 --> 20:43.580
Fred Benson. I kept Fred informed on it. He told me 
to take it to Dr. Wigg on the pay scale. And they had

20:49.646 --> 20:57.873
about, I'd say they had about $500,000 in the 
service. The engineer retention service had

20:57.893 --> 21:00.236
about $500,000. So we automatically, if they had 
the qualifications, they'd go into this pay

21:00.256 --> 21:04.620
status. If they didn't, to find somebody that had 
the qualifications and so forth and so on. But we'd

21:09.787 --> 21:16.173
give them each title, training specialist, 
associate training specialist, assistant

21:09.787 --> 21:16.173
training specialist, you know, to separate them. 
But what was the question? Well, it was about key

21:22.319 --> 21:24.321
decisions. OK. That's how the decisions were 
made. And then once we got that thing in line, and

21:27.004 --> 21:33.570
unfortunately, the borough got them plans, you 
know. He decided to take retirement. He was about

21:36.576 --> 21:40.159
65 years old. And he decided to take retirement. 
And he took retirement. Three days later, he died.

21:43.762 --> 21:46.124
He died in the heart attack. But he didn't bypass 
her. So that moved that phase, whatever you want to

21:49.867 --> 21:56.673
call it, out. And then I brought in a new man as 
associate director. I brought in Milt Brackett

21:58.955 --> 22:01.057
right off. He was a young engineer. And how do you 
spell his last name? Ratkey, R-A-T-K-E. He was a

22:07.037 --> 22:07.958
young'un. He was with TTI. And how did he come about 
being with us? TTI was getting into public works

22:12.544 --> 22:14.787
training. Well, I had created a center for public 
works. And I picked up the paper one Saturday

22:19.092 --> 22:21.015
morning. There was TTI announcing their public 
works thing. So I got a hold of Fred. I said, Fred,

22:27.323 --> 22:30.067
we've got a problem. And he said, what's the 
problem? I told him. He said, I'll take care of that

22:33.102 --> 22:35.645
Monday morning. So he had Jack Keese in one of 
those. In all fact, he'd get out of public work.

22:41.752 --> 22:43.954
That's an extension activity. That's not a 
research activity. And so Milton Rutte was in that

22:46.737 --> 22:50.161
position for TPI. So I just transferred him and one 
other TPI staff member. Their whole people worked

22:53.785 --> 22:56.528
in public. And it turned out that Milton was a very, 
he's a very good engineer, and a very smart

22:57.109 --> 23:02.755
individual, and a very, very good writer. Hard 
work. Very hard work. So I brought him over to the

23:06.044 --> 23:07.306
social director. Well, that made all the rest of 
the... I didn't do it by all. He's there a year, a

23:10.290 --> 23:12.372
year and a half. I observed him for a time. But 
that's how that got started. But when you have to

23:16.757 --> 23:22.324
have a decision made, it took me less than five 
minutes to get it. I could call Benson. He'd say,

23:23.966 --> 23:25.048
well, what did you do? Or what do you want to do? Or I 
could call Calhoun. Calhoun wasn't as quick on the

23:28.812 --> 23:33.037
draw as Benson was, but he was still very quick. You 
know what I mean? Did

23:33.886 --> 23:47.338
you ever get the impression that either one of them 
ever made a snap judgment without thinking it

23:33.886 --> 23:47.338
through?

23:54.205 --> 23:57.328
Let's see, back to other decisions. Because 
you're in charge for 19 years? 73 to 92? uh other

24:03.603 --> 24:32.023
decisions that you now look back on and say those 
were key decisions we made well one key decision

24:03.603 --> 24:32.023
was made you always build on your strength we had a 
reputation in the fire all over state we had fire i

24:03.603 --> 24:32.023
could contact every legislator with one phone 
call uh so i said that's our face the first thing i

24:03.603 --> 24:32.023
did i put about 150 000 in the fire I said, look, we 
don't have any roads in here. We don't have any

24:37.504 --> 24:40.990
training aids out there or exhibits. So I put that 
right on. And that was located then where it is now,

24:43.293 --> 24:48.902
just east of Easterwood Airport. Right. And 
Calhoun was responsible for getting that

24:49.703 --> 24:53.929
location along before I took over the detention 
center. But anyway, so we started building on

24:54.210 --> 24:57.034
that. Then I said, OK, what's your second turn? The 
second strength was electronics, but I had a man in

24:59.932 --> 25:08.522
electronics that, you know, had no education, so 
his name was Artie Patton. Fine person. All these

25:09.923 --> 25:16.951
people I was telling you were fine people, and that 
wasn't the problem with them, was that they didn't

25:09.923 --> 25:16.951
have the background to do what was necessary. So I 
replaced him right off with Dr. Lloyd Fite.

25:20.716 --> 25:22.438
F-I-T-E. F-I-T-E. He was Dick Minardi's 
handyman, you know. So... Oh, Dick would already

25:27.809 --> 25:30.232
call me up one day. He said, Jim, he said, Lloyd 
didn't get his, didn't get his tenure. And he said,

25:35.638 --> 25:40.103
you know, he said, do you want to get out of the 
academic department or whatever? And he said, is

25:40.123 --> 25:42.105
there any way you can take him half-time? I said, 
sure, I'll take him half-time. Well, I took Lloyd

25:44.288 --> 25:47.432
over there with half-time with another spin, and 
that was in February. Half-time, September 1st,

25:47.452 --> 25:50.355
he'd go to a full-time. We had it after we had moved 
to Newark. And so we then started leaning pretty

25:53.278 --> 25:57.343
heavy on electronics, and we got that thing built 
up. We had a gentleman and me in the rural electric

25:57.931 --> 26:05.200
co-ops. That was one time, the same gentleman was 
over at the rural electric co-op training and the

26:05.220 --> 26:12.689
Texas Telephone Association training. So when he 
retired, I saw that was my strength coming. In the

26:18.215 --> 26:27.887
meantime, I got to be very, very well informed and 
acquainted with both the people on the Texas

26:18.215 --> 26:27.887
Telephone Association board and the electric 
party. And they were lobbying for me, the Rural

26:28.373 --> 26:35.585
Electric Corps, to take the Indian Amphibian 
Service with their loggers for funding. And same

26:35.966 --> 26:38.651
thing with Texas Tufts Association. So I said, 
well, you know, that's a growth area. Maybe not

26:43.359 --> 26:45.562
Rural Electric, but you know, we've got others. So 
we started tying them in with TTE. Started tying in

26:48.828 --> 26:50.351
with several others. Got all their training 
materials. TTE had one, five training materials.

26:54.496 --> 26:57.760
They'd give me every bit of their training 
material that we could use, reproduce. But at that

26:57.780 --> 27:01.505
time, see, none of my people had nothing from 
training material. So we got that from the

27:01.526 --> 27:05.371
telephone trains, from the telephone. Then we 
started getting the power train, electric power.

27:09.096 --> 27:13.602
The real electric co-op didn't have any, but 
Houston Light and Fire at that time had plenty.

27:13.622 --> 27:16.926
Texas, the big one that really helped me out on my 
electric training was Texas Fire and Light. It's

27:17.828 --> 27:18.789
now Texas Utility. So that's how we built the 
thing. We took those growth areas. And then after,

27:25.400 --> 27:35.151
you know, we evaluated them, and if they had no 
growth potential, you know, we'd just say, you

27:25.400 --> 27:35.151
know, we may be able to take them out, which we did. 
We did away with three or four divisions. What were

27:37.193 --> 27:37.713
they? Oh, boy.

27:44.321 --> 27:47.364
They were always one-man operations.

27:49.346 --> 27:52.870
We had, well, one thing we did, fire had to have this 
material. And I took that directly away from the

27:53.187 --> 27:55.449
fire. I started to have this training, a whole 
division of it. But now, currently, we have a very

27:58.472 --> 28:00.894
fine guy. He was a Coast Guard colonel retiring. He 
had his master's degree from MIT. When he retired,

28:08.401 --> 28:14.607
we brought him up here with both divisions and also 
put that under fire. We did the same thing with

28:15.228 --> 28:20.713
management training. We used to have two levels of 
management training. One was for the very bold

28:26.344 --> 28:28.366
level training. So then we just started moving to 
the higher level, the supervisor training. So we

28:34.052 --> 28:39.798
had to let, so I let that lower division just go and 
just started what I call supervisor training. And

28:40.959 --> 28:45.324
I'm sure there's five or six others, but I didn't 
write all of them. But we ended up, we started out,

28:45.764 --> 28:49.468
we had five divisions, and we ended up with 17. Our 
staff to – the professionals first is the support

28:51.592 --> 28:56.360
staff. We're about four to one. See, now, that 
staff first had to do a lot of work while those

29:00.787 --> 29:05.995
people were traveling all over the state. And they 
had to have strong staff people. But it's about

29:08.739 --> 29:10.562
four to one. Where – in the areas where you all work, 
in what area, what work area, subject area, was it

29:15.065 --> 29:21.832
easiest to raise money, and which one was most 
difficult to support? Well, it was all, there was

29:22.112 --> 29:25.996
no difference. Let me just tell you why. We started 
the Senate about 10 years after I got there, about

29:27.077 --> 29:35.905
in 78, 79, I put in my first Senate in San Antonio, 
called South Central Texas Regional Training

29:27.077 --> 29:35.905
Center. And at that time, Henry Cisneros was on the 
city council, and then Lenny made the mayor's.

29:43.413 --> 29:43.553
Mm-hmm. They had a program over there that was 
under the junior college, and they were totally

29:44.073 --> 29:49.760
unhappy. The city funded it, and they were totally 
unhappy with it. So the guy that was president of

29:53.184 --> 29:56.808
the junior college over there was Mr. Dr. Wheeler. 
So they asked me to take it over. I said, well, this

29:59.331 --> 30:00.513
is us. We've got as much as we want. I'll go talk to 
him. Well, I'll go talk to him. He was as happy as a

30:04.798 --> 30:06.841
lark to get to me. You can't get along with him. But 
anyway, he had about a $300,000 a year program with

30:08.943 --> 30:12.207
him. And so then when we took over South Central 
Region Training Center, they give us, you know,

30:12.575 --> 30:19.885
whenever I did anything like that, you know, I'll 
give everyone what they need. You've got to

30:19.905 --> 30:22.428
provide me facilities. And you know what I mean? We 
can't rent them. We don't mean that. We mean we want

30:25.232 --> 30:27.335
facilities built. If you want anything and things 
to come in, we have to look the part and play the

30:27.836 --> 30:31.380
part. And so we've got real nice facilities. The 
city got it with EDA grant. And the man in San

30:37.428 --> 30:40.793
Antonio gives us 20 acres of land to build it on. But 
anyway, we turned out to have a big thing. So then

30:43.159 --> 30:49.327
when they redid the hemisphere area, they wanted 
us to concentrate on electronics in that area. So,

30:49.387 --> 30:54.174
wow, they built this beautiful big building, you 
know, right there in the hemisphere. And we had a

30:54.294 --> 30:56.397
25-year lease. And before I left, I got two 25-year 
lease extensions. So that's 75 years. But when we

31:02.946 --> 31:08.434
put that in, that was our first cylinder. And when I 
left that place, we had about a $2 million . So then

31:16.546 --> 31:20.610
the next thing I went in was North Texas, in 
Arlington. We went all over Arlington. And the

31:22.272 --> 31:25.875
next area was in the West Texas area that was . Now, 
all these people were furnishing us these

31:25.895 --> 31:29.459
facilities. And let's see, then Houston. We went 
into the Houston area about the same time we went

31:33.563 --> 31:36.126
into Arlington.
