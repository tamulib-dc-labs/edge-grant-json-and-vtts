WEBVTT

00:04.200 --> 00:09.220
Okay, you were giving impressions of Dr. Calhoun. 
My relationship with him started in the early 60s,

00:09.200 --> 00:13.220
and the Department of Commerce, when I was a guest 
at the Department of Commerce, started what they

00:13.200 --> 00:17.220
called an Office of Technical Services, and what 
they would do is they would provide you funding to

00:17.710 --> 00:23.730
answer inquiries from industry in your state. So 
Dr. Calhoun created at that time what he called the

00:23.710 --> 00:33.210
State Technical Services

00:23.710 --> 00:33.210
Institute. He asked me to serve as director of 
that, which I did. And so I had some connection with

00:36.340 --> 00:40.960
him, but the real connection, I guess, comes with 
the Sea Grant Program that I had there. I had quite a

00:43.940 --> 00:46.960
hunk of that Sea Grant Program at one time, and that 
came down there in the late 60s as well, so it had to

00:46.940 --> 00:53.740
be from 6 to 3. And I did a lot of work with the Sea 
Grant Program. I used my industrial economics

00:58.870 --> 01:04.380
staff, it was perfect. It would be all economic 
studies along the cone, things of that nature.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.380
And... OTS had gone out of business, by the way, 
Office of Technical Services had gone out of

01:13.360 --> 01:15.380
business, so then I got in on the Sea Grant Program, 
and of course we run all those things. So

01:19.360 --> 01:28.780
that's really the period between 65 and 73 is when I 
got really close. Make believe that I had never

01:28.760 --> 01:31.780
seen John Calhoun. Describe him physically and 
his style. I wish I had a picture, I could just give

01:35.760 --> 01:39.780
it to you. Dr. Calhoun was probably

01:39.760 --> 01:51.840
the most diversified, intelligent individual 
that I had. Dr. Calhoun could grasp things

01:51.820 --> 01:57.200
rapidly. He did a lot of reading on these things 
before I come in contact with him or not, but I mean,

02:02.570 --> 02:06.590
he was always very well versed. My experience with 
him was through the State Technical Services Sea

02:06.570 --> 02:15.810
Grant Program. He was a very easy person to talk to. 
I never had seen Dr. Calhoun. Now some people have

02:25.020 --> 02:27.040
seen Dr. Calhoun mad, I've never seen him mad. 
Never had in my life. We

02:30.000 --> 02:39.060
attended a lot of conferences together. I did a lot 
of studies. Then

02:41.040 --> 02:47.380
one day out of the clear blue sky in 1973, on a 
Thursday afternoon, I was working away, and I got

02:50.360 --> 02:55.480
this phone call from Dr. Williams. And Dr. 
Williams said, Jim, I believe I told you before, I

02:56.460 --> 03:00.480
was having my industrial conference start 
Monday, and I had the governor coming over to get

03:00.460 --> 03:03.480
the welcome to press, which I had every year. And 
Dr. Williams said, Jim, I'd like to tell you this.

03:07.610 --> 03:09.690
In a few minutes, we were going to do this. I said, 
well, I'd love to. He said, fine. I went down to his

03:12.360 --> 03:14.760
office. And after about five minutes of shaking 
hands and things, he said, you know, we have a

03:21.040 --> 03:24.060
vacancy as director of the Indian Education 
Service, and we want to create an Office of the

03:24.040 --> 03:27.060
Indian Education. And he said, I'd like for you to 
head to his office. Now, tell me about this man,

03:31.020 --> 03:34.190
Jack Williams. Well, of course, Jack Williams and 
Dr. Calhoun were very close, business-wise. I

03:39.390 --> 03:40.411
don't know if that's working or not. But they were 
always there. They had a lot of respect for each

03:42.390 --> 03:45.410
other. So I said, well, Dr. Williams, I don't know. 
I didn't even know there was a vacancy. I had the

03:49.390 --> 03:53.410
job, but I really enjoyed it. It was getting bigger 
every day. It was getting more statewide and that,

03:55.390 --> 03:58.410
the recognition. I said, I'd have to think about it 
a little bit. He said, well, do you need anything to

04:03.440 --> 04:05.460
think about? I said, yes. I said, I want a copy of the 
budget. I said, I want to see what kind of budget

04:09.000 --> 04:11.020
they have, all the sources of money that's coming 
to us. So he got on the phone, and he called Fred

04:13.090 --> 04:17.550
Benson, if I'm not mistaken. It might have been 
Calhoun, but he called somebody and told them to

04:20.530 --> 04:24.940
get him back in. I'd like you to get some budgets up 
here for the Engineering Extension Service. And

04:30.260 --> 04:31.281
so he got them. How did that happen? And so we just 
did a few minutes. He

04:35.730 --> 04:40.720
said, well, when do you think we can get back 
together? I said, we'll get back together Monday

04:40.700 --> 04:42.720
morning. I have all Saturday and Sunday. We'll get 
back Monday morning. So he said, well, just give me

04:48.850 --> 04:50.870
a ring Monday morning, and then we're ready. So we 
just kept it that way. I didn't get to talk to him

04:55.960 --> 05:00.450
until about 3 o'clock that afternoon. But I went 
there, and I told him what my problem was. And I had,

05:02.430 --> 05:04.450
you know, if I didn't do anything, you know, if I 
want to do this, I need this. I need this. I need

05:07.430 --> 05:08.451
this. I need this. I need this, this, this. Got down 
to the bottom line. The most important thing, I had

05:11.430 --> 05:13.450
to have total control of all the people in the 
organization. And if I was going to be fair with

05:16.020 --> 05:17.041
them, I was going to be bad with each one of them. But 
if they didn't fit into the organization, if I was

05:21.020 --> 05:23.040
going to plan for this, I was going to have to find 
somebody who would feel like the problem. But

05:26.020 --> 05:27.041
anyway, it went on like that. And I had to listen 
pretty long. He said, is that all? I said, yes, sir.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.240
He said, you haven't asked for nothing. He said, 
you haven't asked for nothing. He said, no, I think

05:38.220 --> 05:40.240
he said, you haven't asked for nothing. You can't 
get it. And so I said, OK. So then he called Fred

05:43.440 --> 05:46.960
Benson in Calhoun and told him that I'd accepted

05:46.940 --> 05:52.020
the job. I guess Calhoun could tell you more about 
it from now on. As far as you know, he had talked with

05:55.000 --> 05:58.020
each of them Oh, yes. Oh, I'm quite sure of that. I 
mean, Pastor Williams would have done... No. And

06:03.857 --> 06:05.020
another thing I had, see, I had a lot of research 
projects in that industry, in industrial and

06:08.000 --> 06:09.021
electrical research. And this was in August when 
he called me in. And I told him, I said, I couldn't

06:12.000 --> 06:13.021
possibly accept the job until he sent the firm. 
Because I had sponsors out here that supported me

06:16.000 --> 06:18.340
for years. And I said, well, that'd be fun. That 
didn't bother him any. Describe the extension

06:22.370 --> 06:27.060
service when you took over. What was it? How big was 
it? Well, it was in the old American Legion Hall.

06:32.040 --> 06:36.540
Bob

06:32.040 --> 06:36.540
Weitz was before he moved out there. That used to be 
the... Do you remember that? Or was it already down

06:43.230 --> 06:44.251
when you got here? I don't know. I was here... Do you 
remember where the headquarters for Bob Weitz was

06:48.230 --> 06:50.250
up until just about a year ago? No, I don't. Well, 
you know where the Farmer Student Association

06:53.230 --> 06:55.250
building is now? It used to be that old wooden 
building right across the street. Oh, across the

06:58.230 --> 06:59.251
street. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Over there 
by the police station. Yeah. Well, I didn't know

07:03.067 --> 07:04.250
anybody. I didn't know anybody in any of this 
except Ernie Winochek. The only reason I knew him,

07:08.230 --> 07:11.250
he had lost some of my age. And I had met him through 
Buddy Williams. He and Ernie were pretty good

07:16.460 --> 07:18.480
friends. But he's the only one I knew. And so when I 
took over, they took action at the October 4th. We

07:27.600 --> 07:30.300
made the motion. Ms. Wilson seconded it. This is 
73. 73. No, 70. Yeah, 73. I forgot to go over. He said

07:39.440 --> 07:40.461
before 73. Okay. I forgot to go over. I forgot to go 
over. I forgot to go over. I forgot to go over.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.631
to direct the Engineering Extension Service. But 
when I went over to the Engineering Extension

07:52.610 --> 07:54.630
Service, it had a budget of about $1.5 million and 
they had about $50 million. Where were they based?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.631
I don't know. I mean, you know, they were all in the 
Department of Engineering. They were all in the

08:02.890 --> 08:05.130
Department of Engineering. It had a budget of 
about $1.5 million and they had about $50 million.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.021
Where were they based? All of them here? Yeah. 
Okay. At that time. They were a very, they weren't

08:21.000 --> 08:25.540
up-to-date. There

08:25.520 --> 08:32.030
was not an area that you could find that was taught 
without lesson plans, that they didn't have any

08:32.010 --> 08:33.031
technical manuals. It's a training 
organization. But they had 51 employees

08:34.260 --> 08:57.690
and

08:34.260 --> 08:57.690
about, but their budget come, one-third come from 
Texas Education Agency, one-third come directly

08:57.670 --> 09:02.690
from Appropriations, and then they got one-third 
of their budget from the city. Well,

09:03.670 --> 09:11.350
you've got to realize, the Engineering Extension 
Service was an oval organization. Most of the

09:11.330 --> 09:21.100
employees were, been there, you know, for a job. 
Okay. But anyway, when it was announced, they had

09:22.306 --> 09:29.220
Dr. Mansfield, and Deb was his final person, but

09:29.200 --> 09:37.330
he had been let to lead either through himself or 
through Mr. Bearden. See, Mr. Bearden had been

09:37.310 --> 09:45.070
director and he retired. That he was going to be the 
director.

09:52.000 --> 10:02.380
And all of them, the first day after COVID, 
December the 1st, 1973, I stayed away from it until

10:02.360 --> 10:06.420
I went in for a third religious conference. 
surgery. She was operated on that morning, the

10:09.036 --> 10:11.540
first day I had to go. Two important events. Very 
important events. I stayed with my wife. I was Dr.

10:15.520 --> 10:20.540
Calhoun, which I don't know what I called her. But 
anyway, they knew where I was at. I stayed with her

10:26.300 --> 10:41.357
and

10:26.300 --> 10:41.357
that was her third surgery.

10:41.377 --> 10:42.820
So after they got through with the surgery, it was 
in about five hours, the doctor sent her down to

10:46.800 --> 11:01.580
Houston and started taking chemotherapy.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.580
Anyway, after the third operation, my wife had 
about all the operations she wanted. But anyway,

11:05.560 --> 11:09.580
they made an appointment for me to go see this 
doctor down in Houston. And I got away at the

11:09.560 --> 11:13.580
appointment at 1.30 in the afternoon with my wife 
and I walked in and I checked her in and she shut the

11:13.560 --> 11:17.580
door. I stayed outside. In about 20 minutes, or 15 
minutes, he came out and said, I'm sorry. He said,

11:24.798 --> 11:26.810
your wife won't let me take you. She said, she's not 
going to take you from up there. He said, unless I

11:31.450 --> 11:35.060
get the exam. I said, don't press that. I said, are 
you sure you made up your mind? He said, yup. I said,

11:37.505 --> 11:40.100
how much did I owe him? He said, $35. I wrote him a 
check. And that was in 1973.

11:54.350 --> 11:58.370
Where did, primarily geographically, where did, 
when you took over, where were they doing the

11:58.350 --> 12:02.370
instruction that they were? They were going out in 
motels. No, but where was it? Was it in the Houston

12:05.472 --> 12:06.370
area? Oh, it was all over the state. But it wasn't 
common? It wasn't concentrated in one? No, no.

12:13.044 --> 12:14.370
See, they were doing all the training for rural 
electric co-ops. They did lineman training and

12:16.350 --> 12:18.550
things of this nature. They did a lot of training 
for the Texas Telephone Association. See, they

12:21.390 --> 12:23.410
were getting subsidized. Right. Give more 
examples of that. Okay, law enforcement. Water

12:29.390 --> 12:43.740
and wastewater.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.740
Fireman Training Center was all part of that? Oh, 
yeah. But they used volunteer instructors. They

12:52.760 --> 12:59.950
only had four people. Was there a client that was by 
far the key one, the biggest? Well, your rural

13:03.930 --> 13:05.950
electric co-op, of course, the organization was 
so small, they only had, how do I put

13:09.960 --> 13:41.430
this

13:09.960 --> 13:41.430
thing into

13:09.960 --> 13:41.430
perspective?

13:41.410 --> 13:43.430
Now wait, give me those numbers again. When I took 
over, it was around 51, I think, employees. We had a

13:47.410 --> 13:55.980
$39

13:47.410 --> 13:55.980
million budget. And of that budget, how much did 
you offer? Ten percent. We got three million and

14:02.411 --> 14:05.820
something. The rest you brought in. When you 
started out, you were primarily serving small

14:12.760 --> 14:14.780
town needs, and

14:14.760 --> 14:21.820
the telephone companies were the co-ops. The 
rural telephone companies. Alright, let's see.

14:27.830 --> 14:29.850
When you took over, were there any key office staff 
members that you came to rely on? I'm talking about

14:39.920 --> 14:46.860
the people in the office.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.170
I told you Dr. Matthews was a fine person. He must 
have been a shock

14:49.150 --> 14:58.390
to his sister. He had a different philosophy. His 
philosophy and my philosophy was completely 100%

15:02.370 --> 15:04.390
different.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.850
I was used to the soft money operations. I've 
always had the soft money. They

15:18.240 --> 15:26.040
didn't like it. Another thing I asked Dr. 
Williams, I never did go down to that, but I was up on

15:36.850 --> 15:41.140
the eighth floor. When you took over, in terms of 
reporting, you reported to? Dr. Calhoun. In which

15:50.572 --> 15:58.640
order?

15:58.620 --> 16:00.660
Was it to Benson or was it to both on paper? Both of 
them. I got funding from Indian Education.

16:09.116 --> 16:11.390
Alright, let's go back and talk about this man, 
Benson. He's a Kansan, I think.

16:19.148 --> 16:19.390
Tell me about his working style and so forth.

16:28.950 --> 16:35.310
He never did leave.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.560
He walked up. He said, Mr.

16:37.540 --> 16:51.250
Benson,

16:51.230 --> 16:58.620
I hear about so and so's. We have our ground rules. I 
set my ground rules with him. He told me to inform

17:02.600 --> 17:04.990
you of something. Give me some guidelines because 
I don't have time to tell you everything I do and you

17:11.760 --> 17:13.780
don't have time to listen to everything I do. Give 
me your guidelines. You know what Mr. Benson's

17:21.170 --> 17:23.190
answer was? Keep me informed that the Extension, 
the Extension, Engineering Extension Service

17:31.390 --> 17:33.410
was part of the Texas A&M University and of the 
system. No, the Engineering Extension Service

17:39.440 --> 17:41.550
was always a part of the system. Alright. During 
those years with Williams and Calhoun and Benson,

17:47.780 --> 17:49.860
did it matter, system or campus? Did it matter? And 
how you operated? It didn't matter exactly what

17:57.160 --> 17:59.180
the system was supposed to do. I knew the policies 
and procedures of the system and I knew what the

18:01.160 --> 18:03.180
university was supposed to do and I knew exactly 
what I was expected of in the university and I knew

18:05.160 --> 18:07.820
exactly what I was expected in the institution. 
When you wanted to communicate with them, whom did

18:09.800 --> 18:11.820
you have to go through to get to Calhoun or to 
Benson? Nobody except their secretary. They all,

18:15.800 --> 18:18.700
you always, he had the same, they

18:21.380 --> 18:29.220
had the same thing with me. Alright. As you think 
back on those first years, what were some key

18:31.200 --> 18:35.220
decisions that were made by you or anybody else? 
Pertaining to the system? Or pertaining to the

18:39.200 --> 18:41.560
work of the of the Extension, of the Extension, of 
the... Engineering Extension Service? Well, I'm

18:47.540 --> 18:54.920
not being derogatory,

18:54.900 --> 18:59.341
but I make the role. I had, you know, the rest of them 
was all known to me. They had one title. It was all

19:09.200 --> 19:15.180
called... My first thing that I did when I went in 
there by January the first, I had a I even, I had no

19:19.160 --> 19:32.880
pay range.

19:32.860 --> 19:41.430
Everybody made the same.

19:41.410 --> 19:43.430
So the first thing we did, we gave them something 
to, and then in February that year, I had a meeting

19:47.680 --> 19:55.010
in Wyandale to give them a copy of what I call 
Management by Objective. How we were going to run

19:58.990 --> 20:08.540
the Engineering Extension Service and what part 
they were going to play. But anyway, there was a

20:12.790 --> 20:14.810
few, you've got to remember, this was an old 
organization. They'd all been in together.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.870
Here's a damn stranger. But anyway, after we had 
that meeting, none of them understood management

20:29.080 --> 20:32.280
at all. So we put that thing together. I come into 
the recommendation with Dr. Williams,

20:51.900 --> 20:54.460
they had about, I'd say they had about $500,000. 
We'd automatically, if they had the

21:00.680 --> 21:04.700
qualifications, they'd go into this pay status. 
We'd give them each title,

21:22.360 --> 21:23.027
training specialist. That's how the decisions 
were made. And then once we got that thing in line,

21:28.360 --> 21:46.960
then unfortunately, poor old Gotham

21:28.360 --> 21:46.960
fans, but he didn't buy that,

21:46.940 --> 21:54.100
sir. So we had to take that out. And then I brought in 
a new man as associate director. Right off. He was a

22:01.312 --> 22:04.180
young engineer. How do you spell his last name? 
Ratke,

22:07.820 --> 22:12.171
R-A-T-K. He was a TTI. And how'd he come about being 
a TTI getting into public work training? Well, I

22:17.380 --> 22:20.700
had created a center for public work. And I picked 
up the paper one Saturday morning there was a TTI

22:22.680 --> 22:27.000
announcing a public work training. So I got ahold 
of Fred. I said, I'll take care of that Monday

22:33.360 --> 22:35.440
morning. We had Jack Keese in. And all of a sudden, 
he'd get out of public work. That's an extension

22:42.050 --> 22:44.070
activity. That's not a research activity. And so 
Milton Ratke was in that position. We transferred

22:51.670 --> 22:53.690
him and one other TTI staff member. And it turned 
out that Milton was a very, he's a very good

22:59.770 --> 23:01.790
engineer and a very smart individual and a very, 
very good writer. So I brought him on as associate

23:08.360 --> 23:10.380
director. And he's there every year. You know, 
I've served him for a time. But that's how that got

23:14.360 --> 23:16.430
started. But when you have to have a decision made, 
it took me less than five minutes to get it. I could

23:22.410 --> 23:24.430
call Benson. He'd say, well, what did you do? Or 
what do you want to do? Or I could call Calhoun.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.740
Calhoun wasn't as quick on the draw as Benson was. 
But he was still very quick. You know what I mean? I

23:38.720 --> 23:43.140
mean, I'd have more conversation with Calhoun if I 
didn't get the impression that either one of them

23:45.120 --> 23:47.140
ever made a snap judgment without thinking it 
through. I'm sure there are quite a few of us. I

23:51.740 --> 23:53.760
think everybody that's done that. Let's see. Back 
to other decisions. Because you're in charge for

23:57.740 --> 23:59.760
19 years. 73 to 92. Other decisions that you now 
look back on and say, those were key decisions we

24:06.180 --> 24:10.200
made. Well, one key decision we made, we had a 
reputation in all of the states. I could contact

24:22.270 --> 24:24.290
every legislator with

24:24.270 --> 24:28.040
one phone call. So I said, that's our fate. So the 
first thing I did, I put about $150,000 in that

24:32.020 --> 24:38.960
park. You know, we don't have any training aids out 
there or exhibits. I put that right on. And that was

24:45.920 --> 24:47.940
located then where it is now, just east of 
Easterwood Airport. Right. And Calhoun was

24:50.203 --> 24:53.940
responsible for getting that location before I 
took over the detention center. But anyway, so we

24:56.520 --> 25:01.540
started building on that. But I had a man in 
electronics.

25:10.270 --> 25:12.290
All these people, I was telling you, were fine 
people, and that wasn't the problem was with them.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.380
So I replaced him right off with Dr.

25:21.360 --> 25:44.390
Lloyd Fite.

25:44.370 --> 25:45.035
F-I-T-E. He called me up one day. I took Lloyd over. 
It was halftime. It was September 1st. And so we

25:55.510 --> 25:59.470
then started getting pretty heavy on 
electronics.

26:04.150 --> 26:06.380
We had a gentleman and me in the power office. And we 
had the Texas Telephone Association training.

26:13.699 --> 26:16.380
When he retired, I saw that was my strength 
coverage. In the meantime, I got to be very, very

26:18.410 --> 26:20.430
well and

26:20.410 --> 26:29.500
they

26:20.410 --> 26:29.500
were lobbying for me. The Rural Electric Cops 
would take the Indian Amphitheater Service too

26:33.480 --> 26:38.050
with

26:33.480 --> 26:38.050
their lobbyists. Same thing with the Texas 
Telephone Association. That controls

26:43.190 --> 26:45.210
everything. And you're not rural electric, but 
you've got others. So we started tying him in with

26:49.980 --> 26:52.000
T-E. Started tying him in with several others. But 
at that time, see, not a lot of people had nothing.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.480
So we got that from the telephone and then we 
started getting the powertrain, electric power.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.430
The Rural Electric Cops didn't have any, but 
Houston Light and Power at that time had 20. Texas,

27:14.162 --> 27:20.170
the big one that really helped me out on my electric 
train was Texas Fire and Light. So that's how we

27:22.330 --> 27:25.850
built the thing. And then after, you know, we had no 
growth potential,

27:33.600 --> 27:35.620
we maybe ought to take him out, which we did. We did 
away with three or four divisions. They

27:37.600 --> 27:45.530
were always one-man operations. We had, well, one 
thing we did, fire had hazardous materials. And I

27:52.120 --> 27:54.260
took that directly away. Started a hazardous 
system with it. But Al Sterling,

27:58.600 --> 28:06.530
a very fine guy, had his master's degree from MIT. 
When he retired, we brought him up here with both

28:10.560 --> 28:13.060
divisions and also put that under fire. We did the 
same thing with with management training. We used

28:21.750 --> 28:23.770
to have two levels of management training. This 
was a very bold one. When we just started,

28:33.030 --> 28:35.360
we were going to get to the higher level, the 
supervisor training. So I let that lower division

28:37.360 --> 28:40.590
just go and we just started what I call supervisor 
training. And I'm sure there's five or six others

28:46.760 --> 28:48.780
that I'm not all paying attention to. But

28:48.760 --> 28:53.900
we ended up, we started out, we had five divisions 
and we ended up with 17. Our staff to professionals

29:00.630 --> 29:02.650
first is we support staff. We're about, see now 
that staff don't have people, but it's about four

29:09.350 --> 29:11.460
or five people. Where, in the areas where you all 
work, in what area, what work area, subject area,

29:18.030 --> 29:20.050
was it easiest to raise money and which one was most 
difficult to support? Well, it was all, there was

29:25.590 --> 29:26.549
no difference. Let me just tell you why. We started 
centers about 10 years after I got there, about in

29:29.590 --> 29:31.610
78, 79. I put in my first center in San Antonio 
called South Central Texas Regional Training

29:33.740 --> 29:35.760
Center. And at that time, Henry Cisneros, was on 
the city council, and then Lenny made the merits.

29:44.940 --> 29:49.060
They had a program over there under the junior 
college and they were totally unhappy with the

29:49.040 --> 29:51.120
city funding. And they were totally unhappy with 
it. So the guy, the president of the junior college

29:55.100 --> 29:57.120
over there was Dr. Wheeler. So they asked me to take 
it over. I said, you know what, I'll go talk to him.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.580
Well, all of them were talking, he was happy as a 
lark to get to me. I said, I can't get along with him.

30:10.090 --> 30:12.110
But anyway, he had about a $300,000 a year program 
with him. And so then when we took over South

30:14.090 --> 30:16.110
Central Region Training Center, you know, 
whenever I did anything like that, you know, I'll

30:18.630 --> 30:20.650
give everyone what they need. You've got to 
provide me facilities. I mean, we can't rent them.

30:25.260 --> 30:27.280
We don't mean that. We mean we want facilities 
built. If you want anything and things to come in,

30:31.260 --> 30:33.280
we have to look the part and play the part. And so we 
got real nice facilities. The city got it in the EDA

30:35.260 --> 30:37.280
grant. And the man in San Antonio gets 20 acres of 
land to build it on. But anyway, we turned out to

30:41.260 --> 30:43.280
have a big thing. So then when they redid the 
hemisphere area, they wanted us to get, to

30:47.260 --> 30:49.280
concentrate on electronics in that area. So they 
built this beautiful big building, you know,

30:51.260 --> 30:53.280
right there in the hemisphere. And we had a one 
25-year lease. And before I left, I got two 25-year

30:57.260 --> 30:59.280
leases for 75 years. But when we put that in, we got, 
that was our first cylinder. When I left that

31:08.600 --> 31:12.920
thing, we had

31:12.900 --> 31:17.150
about a $2 million . So then the next thing that went 
in was North Texas. And the next cylinder was in the

31:24.110 --> 31:26.310
West Texas area. These people were purchasing 
these facilities in Houston. We went into the

31:32.330 --> 31:34.350
Houston area about the same time we went into 
Arlington.
