00:02.440 --> 00:07.520
One of the things I always noticed in a department 
when I was running it, anytime you're talking

00:07.500 --> 00:14.640
about changes and suggestions from faculty, they 
pretend they're coming up with a big original idea

00:14.620 --> 00:19.520
about how to do graduate program or how to do this, 
how to do that. But when you investigate it in

00:20.020 --> 00:25.300
detail, you'll find that what they're proposing 
to do is exactly the same way they did it where they

00:25.280 --> 00:28.120
came from. And so I think anytime you get these 
outsiders coming in, you tend to, you do get some of

00:39.740 --> 00:42.260
that mixture, but I'm not sure it's always that 
great. Sometimes what we had was better than what

00:42.420 --> 00:45.280
they're trying to propose. I'll tell you one other 
thing that I've noticed that I think A&M ought to

00:47.440 --> 00:53.440
improve on. That is the way they treat their former 
presidents and so on. Now,

00:59.220 --> 01:08.230
when I came here, Walton had been president, and I 
think he was the one that got us that permanent

01:08.210 --> 01:10.330
fund, wasn't he? Well, we began to get a better 
share. I meant that was when he got, he was the one

01:14.770 --> 01:19.050
that looked up the law and got all that going. And he 
was running the post office or something. Then

01:24.640 --> 01:32.260
when Gilchrist stepped down, Fred Benson finally 
gave him an office over there in Zachary. Then when

01:33.440 --> 01:41.000
Benson finally stepped down, old Flipsy wouldn't 
even give him an office anywhere for a long time.

01:42.310 --> 01:48.730
And I just think that they lose a lot by not having 
these people more involved in. Now, I went to this

01:49.050 --> 01:54.510
little junior college, this little Baptist 
junior college, and we had, I think we had chapel

01:49.050 --> 01:54.510
every morning. And the guy that I took college 
algebra and trigonometry was born in about

01:55.310 --> 02:00.390
mid-1800s. Dr. R.L. Moore. Big, tall, skinny guy, 
wore a frock-tail coat and wing-tip collars with a

02:04.030 --> 02:10.090
string tie. And he didn't have any problem with 
what was right and wrong. But he was very revered.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.920
He sat up on the stage every day, and the president 
always deferred to him. And he was still teaching a

02:24.070 --> 02:29.670
course in college algebra and trigonometry, and 
he taught one in Greek. That was his, but he wanted

02:29.650 --> 02:34.560
to get associated with the average student. Not 
just the preachers. And every morning, I'll tell

02:36.800 --> 02:40.660
you this one, you might enjoy it. Every morning in 
class, he would tell us a little moral story. And it

02:47.240 --> 02:51.120
was also back in those depression days of 
encouraging students. Now, I don't know whether

02:51.200 --> 02:52.861
we do enough of that. Motivating them, just 
telling them, you've got to make something of

02:53.920 --> 02:56.860
yourself. And he mentioned that Dick Wayne, that 
Hall that used to be in mathematics, was in one of

02:58.580 --> 03:04.780
his classes. And he really worked hard. And he went 
on to be professor at one of the greater

03:06.460 --> 03:10.320
universities, is what he said. But he was, of 
course, against smoking and everything. He was so

03:17.070 --> 03:22.250
against smoking that what he did, they said at one 
time, was buy up all of the tobacco in the little

03:17.070 --> 03:22.250
town there, take it out on the middle of the campus, 
and burn it. But anyhow, in those years, and that

03:24.690 --> 03:35.170
was about 1939, the number one hit parade song was, 
I don't want to set the world on fire, I just want to

03:35.210 --> 03:39.010
start a flame in your heart. And old Dr. Moore came 
in one morning, and he said, and he always called us

03:39.730 --> 03:45.990
young people. He said, young people, I just don't 
know what this world's coming to. He said, I was

03:51.820 --> 03:56.920
coming to walk, walking to work this morning, and I 
passed this young man. He was pushing this

03:57.600 --> 04:03.800
wheelbarrow, and he was singing, I don't want to 
set the world on fire. And young people, he was. He

04:06.120 --> 04:07.073
wasn't. He wasn't. So, but I, now there is an 
example. We're not getting, I think there's a

04:13.690 --> 04:21.810
tendency in all organizations to let us just bury 
the guy once we get through with him. Instead of, if

04:23.150 --> 04:29.110
he was good enough to serve and run your 
organization, he would really be good enough to

04:23.150 --> 04:29.110
have around to help you. And we need to, that's one 
of the things that we need to take advantage of. I

04:34.950 --> 04:36.371
propose to. I propose to President Bowen, and I 
couldn't think of a better title than alumni

04:36.430 --> 04:44.170
professor. And I said, every year when the various 
faculty members retire, why not then try to look

04:44.530 --> 04:52.700
and say, which of these would we like to be able to 
still claim were part of our team, still use their

04:52.800 --> 05:00.980
talents and abilities, and ask the products of 
that department or that unit, would you help us?

05:09.060 --> 05:14.220
And I said, why not raise the money to give this 
person a small little honorarium so that this

05:15.890 --> 05:20.190
person could still teach a course or do a little 
research. We could call on for advice. Randy

05:23.570 --> 05:28.930
Mattson, then executive director of the former 
students, he said, I could raise that money with a

05:23.570 --> 05:28.930
few phone calls. But Dr. Bowen didn't see that as a 
good idea. I wonder how he will feel when he

05:32.410 --> 05:35.290
retires. Because see, just look what's happened 
to them. Mm-hmm. They're just walking around.

05:39.620 --> 05:40.235
Nobody. Yep. Yep. And Fred, old Flipsy, wouldn't 
even, and then Flipsy would just browbeat the hell

05:41.502 --> 05:50.530
out of you. I'll give you one story that got him off 
of my back. I was up there meeting with him and Skip

05:54.330 --> 05:58.550
Fletcher. Boy, they just beat me all over the place 
about this and that, getting more money for this

06:00.090 --> 06:09.890
and more money for that, and a lot of things. And so I 
just kind of let it slide off. When I got back to the

06:14.460 --> 06:19.820
office, I decided the way I'll fix him is I'm going 
to write him a letter. And I'm going to tell him, you

06:21.480 --> 06:25.760
told me several things this morning in our 
discussion. And before I tell my faculty what you

06:25.740 --> 06:32.850
said, I want to make sure that I got the details 
correct. Then I listed them. I didn't hear

06:36.200 --> 06:38.740
anything from old Flipsy. And then I throw him in. 
He says, Charlie. Charlie, we're going to make

06:40.820 --> 06:44.520
peace between your house and my house. And he never 
did jump me anymore. Now, he succeeded Dean

06:49.190 --> 06:51.290
Benson? Well, no. He was assistant to Richardson. 
Oh, oh, oh. And he and I got along fine after that,

06:55.890 --> 07:00.690
but he didn't try to come after me anymore. He would 
intimidate people if he knew that he could. You

07:04.330 --> 07:07.610
know, there's some people who run over others if 
they realize they can. Yes. And so that really

07:08.804 --> 07:10.870
cooled his heels. And from then on, even 
Richardson would get him to go talk to me rather

07:10.870 --> 07:17.570
than do it himself after I told him that if they 
wanted the job, they could have it. But Richardson

07:21.730 --> 07:23.490
helped me a lot. We worked together. But I just, you 
know, stood my ground on that. I didn't see any use

07:27.670 --> 07:31.310
of my stepping down at that particular time. 
Trace, for this recording, after Fred Benson

07:31.510 --> 07:39.330
served as dean, who were the other deans? Let's 
see. Page was the next dean that was selected.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.357
Describe him. Well, he was a very nice individual. 
Where'd he come from?

07:54.720 --> 07:55.461
Let's see. I can't remember. It was a northern 
university. He was in kind of an impossible

08:00.870 --> 08:03.190
situation. Skip Fletcher had the tease. If you 
have one man in charge of the Texas Engineering

08:05.610 --> 08:08.910
Experiment Station, the other in charge of the 
academic, it'll never work because I started out

08:11.210 --> 08:13.870
working under that one. And Barlow and Mello had 
it. And they didn't even talk to one another. They

08:18.090 --> 08:22.610
sent letters up and down the hall on that new 
engineering building. And each one of them

08:22.870 --> 08:25.710
expects you to work full-time for them, is what the 
problem is. And so Page had it all against him to

08:28.260 --> 08:34.210
begin with, but he didn't really have any guts. And 
he wouldn't go after, I don't think he went after

08:37.340 --> 08:42.140
money like he should have for us. Because I... Our 
operating budgets were so small that I used most

08:46.220 --> 08:49.500
all my gift and grant funds to do things that I 
should have been spending state money on. All

08:52.820 --> 08:53.746
travel. I paid for it with gift and grant. Go give 
papers. I paid for that with gift and grant money.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.650
And I couldn't get him to... He wouldn't stand up 
for you over there. And so that was... I think he's a

09:13.400 --> 09:14.421
nice... He's a nice individual, pleasant. But he 
just didn't have the grit to stand up to somebody to

09:21.560 --> 09:23.480
tell them, you know, we need this. Who was next 
after him?

09:28.580 --> 09:31.380
I guess they had several interims in there. 
McDonald was an interim for a while. And I guess

09:34.560 --> 09:38.810
that was about the next one. And I guess the next one 
was Richardson. Describe him, where he came from.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.281
He came from MIT. And I think he's... He's a real 
good manager. He doesn't like any confrontation

09:50.170 --> 09:52.850
at all. He can hardly... But he's really good at 
one-to-one discussions.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.840
But he didn't like to have anybody criticize... 
You know, a lot of times things really ought to be

10:07.260 --> 10:09.280
debated even if people get a little hot to find out 
what the real facts are. Get them out and open. And

10:14.640 --> 10:16.241
he didn't like this. He didn't like... He's just an 
individual. He seems to be kind of timid. He's not a

10:20.860 --> 10:21.941
good speaker. He did all right running. I think he 
did a good job, except he was just a little timid on

10:27.010 --> 10:29.610
some of those things. And he had Flipsy doing all of 
the nasty work. He had him doing it for him. But I

10:37.270 --> 10:39.330
think he was good, and he was also good when he got 
into the higher position. But he was not a good

10:43.010 --> 10:46.530
public representation of Texas A&M University. 
You need a man. You need a man that can get up there

10:48.750 --> 10:49.991
and speak. And he couldn't do it. Describe to 
someone who might not be aware of the realities of

10:58.680 --> 11:02.500
the College of Engineering, Texas Engineering 
Experiment Station, and the Texas Engineering

11:05.820 --> 11:09.640
Extension Service. Explain how those are related 
and describe their functions. All right. The

11:15.929 --> 11:17.800
Texas A&M... The College of Engineering is a part 
of Texas A&M University. The Texas Engineering

11:24.820 --> 11:26.640
Experiment Station is a separate state agency on a 
chart. It would occupy a position parallel to

11:30.280 --> 11:33.780
Texas A&M University. And also, as I recall, Texas 
Extension Service is the same way. And I'm not sure

11:39.420 --> 11:41.340
whether TTI is. It may be... And where do they 
report? They report... They report now to the...

11:48.420 --> 11:49.301
Well, they've had them report, and they've had 
them report to different ones. They report now to

11:51.920 --> 11:55.760
the Dean of Engineering, because the dean is in 
charge of all of it. One time, they reported to

11:58.120 --> 12:00.720
different people, and there's where all the 
problems, because the poor little old faculty

12:02.020 --> 12:03.720
member, he has to work for both of them, all three of 
them. And so all the problems come down, and he's

12:09.360 --> 12:10.701
the stretch. And you, as a department head, needed 
to be able... I had to work with all of them. Yeah.

12:18.311 --> 12:19.061
And you... You might want to get funding from all of 
them. I'll tell you one other thing that I think

12:24.080 --> 12:28.120
that universities don't work nearly hard enough 
at. In fact, sometimes they go the wrong ways.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.321
Well, there are two things. One of them, just 
remind me if I don't come back to it, is the

12:34.480 --> 12:35.401
coursework, and another one is on funding people. 
The one on funding. All the time I was head of the

12:43.900 --> 12:45.700
department, I was able to keep everybody on a 
12-month basis, regardless of whether they had

12:49.120 --> 12:52.580
research or not. And we did that by using gift and 
grant funds, and I just juggled it to where we made

12:55.580 --> 12:59.300
it work, because it's very difficult to live on a 
nine-month salary. And so I felt like everybody

13:04.360 --> 13:07.840
that's around the university ought to be 
full-time employed. And I think that one of the

13:09.720 --> 13:14.560
things that stirs up more resentment on a 
university campus is having professors on a

13:14.540 --> 13:18.700
nine-month basis, and administrators whom they 
are not really over-enthusiastic

13:22.200 --> 13:26.440
about to begin with, any administrator, on a 
12-month basis. And here these people are trying

13:30.620 --> 13:33.540
to get by on a nine-month basis. And I think that 
what we ought to do is we've got a big plant,

13:37.980 --> 13:42.020
millions of dollars invested in the facilities 
here. We ought to expand the summer program to

13:44.640 --> 13:47.240
where we've got 12-month employment throughout 
the year. We're not an agricultural society.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.860
anymore that was the reason that was originally 
set up we ought to get around to the fact that we are a

13:53.840 --> 14:00.180
12-month operation and that we need full-time 
employees and and i think you'd get a lot more

14:00.160 --> 14:05.860
loyalty among employees if you had because these 
that can't get it and it's very difficult in some

14:05.840 --> 14:13.140
areas to get research during the summer and this 
shouldn't be the way we operate and we should try to

14:13.120 --> 14:18.340
do it on a 12-month basis and have people doing 
something there ought to be a and i think there's a

14:19.120 --> 14:23.380
lot of students that want to take courses more 
course in the summer can't get them because the

14:23.360 --> 14:27.700
money's not allocated for summer courses they're 
trying to seem to be trying to keep those down but

14:27.680 --> 14:33.700
they ought to be going the other way just try to get 
more more summer courses jumping way back now as in

14:36.040 --> 14:41.980
those 23 years that you were department head 
looking back who were some of the key faculty

14:43.420 --> 14:48.400
members that you brought in i brought nearly the 
whole bunch i know but who were the ones that made

14:49.180 --> 14:53.280
the most i'm not going to ask you the negative just 
the positive actually most of them did all right

14:53.260 --> 14:58.240
who were the ones that were the cream of the crop 
well uh eubank was a good one would describe each

14:58.220 --> 15:04.720
one of them as you're going along okay well eubank 
came to us from rose poly as an undergraduate and

15:04.700 --> 15:12.310
went to uh i've forgotten where he didn't go for his 
graduate work he was in thermodynamics and he

15:12.290 --> 15:15.910
helped the get the thermodynamics program 
started and he did uh he was a good methodical

15:19.890 --> 15:29.100
teacher he did teaching as well as research and 
he's still involved and then another one that i

15:30.440 --> 15:39.340
brought in was ron darby and he may not be he wasn't 
as successful in getting research he was uh

15:39.320 --> 15:45.180
probably more negative on putting in for it

15:48.320 --> 15:50.180
saying he wouldn't get it or something like that uh 
but he is real real good individual and uh so that

15:50.160 --> 15:57.950
was another one dick davidson was another real 
good one that we brought in and he was had been good

15:57.930 --> 16:06.750
uh throughout his whole career he's excellent 
teacher and original ideas and and good at uh

16:06.730 --> 16:19.690
generally across the board um

16:06.730 --> 16:19.690
let's see um ray anthony was another one i brought 
him in as you were recruiting these people how did

16:19.670 --> 16:28.610
you identify the high quality faculty members the 
potential faculty members how did you find them oh

16:37.400 --> 16:44.300
uh well we'd uh some of these we checked with the 
found out who was coming out of rice there i knew the

16:45.160 --> 16:49.980
profs down there and the good ones and i got some 
from them and uh ray we'd had as a graduate student

16:51.130 --> 16:58.030
went over texas got his phd so we knew him we also 
hired hall in later and although he's been through

17:00.760 --> 17:06.540
a lot of the things i don't think he measures up to 
these other people but uh he was he's a really

17:06.520 --> 17:13.100
go-getter as far as hunting funds but he doesn't 
have the staying power that i'd say some of the

17:14.540 --> 17:21.260
others did as far as time after time um

17:21.400 --> 17:33.620
see i guess that those are the old standbys that are 
over there what were some some kind of big step big

17:36.070 --> 17:43.840
achievement research projects that the 
department did during your years of leadership

17:43.820 --> 17:53.380
well i think that they did made numerous 
contributions in in thermodynamics they had a

17:54.960 --> 17:59.460
thermometer thermodynamics group that got 
together and they all had several grants going

18:00.480 --> 18:02.500
there

18:05.450 --> 18:10.110
and that carried on for a good long while to where 
it's gotten now very difficult to get that type of

18:11.320 --> 18:14.460
money they want to put money on something that's 
going to be turn the world around you know but this

18:15.240 --> 18:22.830
was collecting good solid thermodynamic data 
that they there was quite a bit, we made a lot of

18:25.290 --> 18:30.690
progress in catalysis and kinetics. Ray Anthony 
and others worked on that. And Ron did some work on

18:34.410 --> 18:37.070
rheology. And I did a lot of work on distillation. 
In fact, I've got two papers. I'm trying to get out

18:43.790 --> 18:46.570
of the field, but I've got two papers right now that 
are going to be published. And one of them is going

18:47.470 --> 18:51.790
into a journal where one of the editors are 
retiring and they ask me to write a paper. And I did,

18:53.030 --> 18:58.230
and I used a concept I've been using in teaching a 
class. And I wrote it up, and sure enough, it's

18:58.970 --> 19:01.850
accepted. It really wasn't any experimental 
research. It was just a concept. It was ability,

19:07.660 --> 19:13.440
technique for representation of indimensional 
space in not just three, four, five, in

19:13.420 --> 19:19.180
two-dimensional space and represent all the 
complexities there in two dimensions. And it's

19:23.220 --> 19:24.661
real simple. It's very similar to just 
representing it for two components. And then

19:28.880 --> 19:33.230
another one that I've got coming out, I didn't 
really think about getting a paper. A guy from

19:36.330 --> 19:40.110
Vladivostok, a Russian, wrote me on email that 
he'd like me to send him some of the papers that we

19:40.090 --> 19:44.570
had. And instead of doing that, what I did was just 
sit down. I said, well, that poor guy doesn't have

19:47.890 --> 19:49.690
any money, can't even buy the papers and so on. What 
I'll do is just sit down. I'm going to derive him

19:53.210 --> 19:54.411
some equations and give him ones that we haven't 
ever published before. And so I did, and he's ended

19:59.030 --> 20:01.150
up, he took those and made the problem a little 
bigger. And he's got a paper written now. I'm going

20:07.710 --> 20:09.970
to be a publisher with him. From Vladivostok. It's 
on the eastern front over there of Russia. Who

20:14.610 --> 20:20.010
were the big, were there any key industry 
supporters for chemical engineering? Research

20:23.590 --> 20:25.670
here during your years? Oh yeah, we had Dow 
continue to support us some. And there weren't no

20:29.370 --> 20:33.970
real big ones, but enough grants. Dow, I've got 
$20,000 a year to help me do this numerical stuff

20:41.010 --> 20:43.310
and theoretical developments, which was a good, 
back in those days, that's a good little sum of

20:44.230 --> 20:47.630
money just to have coming in every year. So we had 
some money like that. We had a lot. I also had some

20:52.350 --> 20:53.571
from National. Science Foundation. We got quite a 
bit that way, and other organizations. Also Amoco

20:58.950 --> 21:03.490
helped quite a bit with our labs and so forth. So we 
managed one way or another to get grants from one

21:04.270 --> 21:08.010
another and the government and all these people to 
try to keep enough coming in to keep the research

21:12.520 --> 21:14.620
program going and pay the graduate students as 
well. Under your leadership, which do you think

21:16.500 --> 21:19.800
was more important? The theoretical or the 
practical? I don't

21:23.740 --> 21:36.820
know that there was all that much that really can't 
be divided that well down the line because there's

21:36.800 --> 21:40.360
a lot of theoretical concepts involved in a lot of 
them that can be practical problems. And I don't

21:44.480 --> 21:48.920
know that I'd want to make a judgment on that. Of 
these key faculty, in your years of leadership,

21:54.660 --> 21:55.801
did we lose some? Did we lose some key faculty 
members to industry or another institution that?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.840
No, we really didn't lose many people. The

22:02.820 --> 22:10.970
only one, we lost one or two, but we weren't 
concerned about it because

22:10.950 --> 22:16.030
we weren't sure we wanted them anyway. And so they 
got hired somewhere else. We brought a whole group

22:18.670 --> 22:22.130
of young ones. Watson is another one that's done 
real well over there I didn't mention. But. But.

22:26.690 --> 22:26.855
But. But. But. But. But. But. But. to make sure they 
got started in research how did you get how did you

22:32.887 --> 22:38.860
do that well we met with them find out what they were 
doing and giving them advice and also putting a

22:39.920 --> 22:44.340
little pressure on them you want to try to get write 
this proposal or that one and uh so uh i think they

22:44.320 --> 22:51.860
thought we might have been a little hard on them but 
uh there's the time to do something is when you

22:56.080 --> 23:02.840
first get them and so they made it and i got a watson 
actually i told richardson this and he was amazed

23:02.820 --> 23:10.550
that i did it uh watson came up for tenure and the 
full professors looked at him and decided they

23:10.530 --> 23:15.980
didn't want to give him tenure and so they reported 
me and i said well i'm not really sure whether they

23:15.960 --> 23:21.500
know this man well enough i'm going to see what so i 
appointed another committee made up of the

23:21.480 --> 23:27.260
associate professors of his his precise peers to 
make a judgment on him what they thought about him

23:27.240 --> 23:33.240
and they came up positive and so i decided i'd go 
ahead and recommend him for tenure and no richard

23:33.540 --> 23:39.800
says you mean you went against your full 
professors i said well i sure did because i thought

23:39.780 --> 23:44.920
he deserved it i don't know whether i guess it could 
be debatable yet but he's doing real well now as an

23:44.900 --> 23:52.840
outsider we heard a way over in history i heard that 
it was common practice in engineering in those

23:52.820 --> 23:59.400
years that a new faculty member got a little bit of 
funding through the experiment station or some

24:00.100 --> 24:03.400
research account to start with yeah we did some of 
that and i gave them some department money and that

24:03.540 --> 24:08.280
they were told that by the time three four five 
years in the future they were expected to be

24:08.260 --> 24:14.120
getting their own research well we we tried to get 
them as soon as possible to start looking for it

24:14.100 --> 24:19.800
okay because it takes two or three years after you 
even start so we had them start looking for it in

24:20.420 --> 24:25.800
some area that they were familiar with and then we 
gave them enough to try to give them enough to get

24:25.780 --> 24:32.120
started trying to do something are there some 
individual honors that came to the department

24:32.100 --> 24:38.440
during your years of leadership that you'd like to 
well i don't remember all of them we got nearly

24:38.420 --> 24:42.840
every one of them as these distinguished awards 
nearly everybody in the department got teaching

24:43.940 --> 24:47.880
or research what about what about national or 
international awards yeah there are several of

24:49.380 --> 24:53.240
those as the years went on with what other schools 
by the time you retired as department head what

25:04.060 --> 25:11.200
other schools should we be compared with in 
chemical engineering oh i i think that uh uh

25:12.570 --> 25:19.230
university of texas rice all of these are strong 
schools were we there were we in there well we uh i

25:19.210 --> 25:24.910
don't know that we're university of texas always 
had a little more support than we ever had boy i'll

25:24.890 --> 25:31.310
tell you we had so little support in the 50s i 
remember norman road asked they were building

25:31.290 --> 25:35.710
everything up at uh what was the name of this school 
that went over to the university system arlington

25:35.690 --> 25:41.560
they were building all kind of engineering 
buildings up there and we still had those old

25:42.100 --> 25:45.560
buildings over there where electrical was you 
know back i was in the navy unit with norman road and

25:46.260 --> 25:51.720
and kenny hancock and some of them and fred benson 
and schiller and norman told us he says you know i i

25:51.700 --> 26:00.360
was talking to uh uh let's see i guess it was mr 
gilchrist i was talking mr grillchrist yesterday

26:01.780 --> 26:07.000
i said mr gilchrist you know how norman was he's 
very outspoken you remember him don't you norman

26:06.980 --> 26:12.520
road are we getting ready to move the college 
engineering up to arlington he's a mr gilchrist no

26:12.500 --> 26:19.640
why he said well you're putting all the money in 
buildings up there to the down here but those were

26:19.620 --> 26:25.400
really lean years i'll tell you they really were 
all right by comparison what were the early 80s

26:26.260 --> 26:31.720
like well uh where the change was was when we got 
zachary and that was about 73 or somewhere along

26:31.780 --> 26:37.080
there and that then we really were beginning to be 
able to compete actually when we had those old

26:44.020 --> 26:49.960
facilities i didn't even like to take uh former 
graduate i mean potential graduate students

26:49.940 --> 26:55.800
through a lab because it was so ratty in fact when i 
had old charlie over here jones that was president

26:55.780 --> 27:01.880
of exxon and jim galloway i didn't realize they 
were as bad as they were and i took them through and

27:01.940 --> 27:08.120
we sat back down up there into my office and and old 
charlie jones says chuck claire you need some you

27:08.740 --> 27:16.680
need some more facilities so an outsider could see 
it and we didn't have we got we were on the list and

27:16.660 --> 27:21.400
that used to worry doc all the time getting a new 
building and i decided that's one thing i'm not

27:21.380 --> 27:25.880
going to worry about it's more important what you 
do regardless what the dang building looks like

27:25.860 --> 27:30.840
than having the building because it's really the 
states anyway but we were we were always first on

27:31.940 --> 27:37.400
the list and then come along petroleum would get 
one in fact they got two before we ever got one and uh

27:37.380 --> 27:45.850
but finally we got in the loop and and got some 
facilities but we really didn't have that kind of

27:45.830 --> 27:50.010
support for a long time by the way we got behind and 
also not having girls over here it was hard to draw

27:50.550 --> 27:56.730
graduate students and all those formative years 
and so it wasn't an easy battle as the years went on

27:56.710 --> 28:02.490
in the late 70s and 80s did we begin to be 
competitive in salaries yeah we're we're closer

28:02.630 --> 28:09.930
to being competitive now i think we probably are 
now no after they started kicking them up we became

28:09.910 --> 28:18.090
we were started being competitive with salaries i 
don't know exactly how they are some of these

28:23.910 --> 28:29.610
people watch them and plot them all the time i don't 
but i think our salary is pretty good right now for

28:29.590 --> 28:32.570
you as a department head who also was a real world 
faculty member what were the greatest joys of all

28:32.630 --> 28:40.090
these years well i guess actually it still is is 
really getting up and teaching in class

28:40.070 --> 28:48.120
interaction with students and and a lot of things 
i'm teaching the courses i'm taught is i develop

28:49.610 --> 28:54.590
the books that i'm teaching out of and develop the 
theory that i'm teaching so it's just real

28:54.570 --> 29:01.150
pleasure to get up there and be able to explain 
things to students i did i taught a class this

29:03.290 --> 29:12.750
morning eight o'clock please share if you can any 
examples of aggie good bull tricks pranks that you

29:12.730 --> 29:20.960
may have been aware of surely students must have 
tried to pull something on a chemical engineering

29:20.940 --> 29:27.980
faculty member somewhere along the line oh well i 
can tell you a couple that happened to faculty

29:27.960 --> 29:34.900
members one of them i had this graduate student 
nathan welch who was i think he was hyperactive and

29:34.960 --> 29:43.030
he you'd see him walking up and down the hall he was 
sharp as a tag and he'd have a coke in one hand the

29:43.010 --> 29:50.600
cigarette in the other and a pencil over his ear and 
just walking as fast as he could and so one day i had

29:50.580 --> 29:55.000
to go out of town and i asked him to teach my class and 
i said now i want you to really give them a good

29:56.300 --> 30:07.360
presentation and he said well i'll give them so 
when i got back what had happened was the students

30:08.540 --> 30:16.170
told me that old nate got in there and he was just 
going like a house on fire he was taking a swig of

30:16.150 --> 30:21.450
that coke and then he'd smoke the cigarette and 
then he'd put the pencil up on his ear and then he'd

30:21.430 --> 30:27.210
smoke a cigarette again finally he laid the 
cigarette up on his ear and he says don't you all

30:27.190 --> 30:36.870
tell dr holland this will be my last lecture

30:36.850 --> 30:49.550
and then old dr lindsay i remember one time he was 
always huffing and puffing around you know we're

30:50.170 --> 30:54.270
teaching i was teaching a course over in the new 
engineering building we used we're getting ready

30:54.250 --> 31:00.190
he liked to go on inspection trips we were getting 
ready to go on an inspection trip and so doc was

31:00.170 --> 31:07.380
preparing them and he came over and he came 
blustering in there and he told him about the trip
