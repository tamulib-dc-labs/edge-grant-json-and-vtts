and his head is bald, but he's got fringes of hair. 
And then one of my former students, rice farmer

00:07.469 --> 00:30.325
from Beaumont, and I don't remember the other one, 
but I was one of the eight first people that were

00:07.469 --> 00:30.325
recognized by this school of agriculture and 
biology or what, biology. biology or whatever it

00:30.710 --> 00:32.874
was. Do you have any favorite amusing memories, 
funny moments? You've got all of them. Okay, all

00:45.298 --> 00:45.979
right. There's others, I'm sure, but

00:51.567 --> 00:57.233
I had a really satisfying experience at A&M, 
except I didn't get the salary I deserved. And I

00:58.835 --> 01:10.467
think that there's too many people that get 
recognized not for what they've done, but what

00:58.835 --> 01:10.467
they've given A&M. That's one thing that I'm 
bothered by.

01:19.208 --> 01:24.076
Last question, what feelings do you have in your 
heart about A&M? Well, I really am grateful to A&M,

01:24.436 --> 01:45.570
but I also feel like that I have contributed to A&M 
in a way that very few other people have

01:24.436 --> 01:45.570
contributed to A&M since the school was down to 
2,000 in enrollments. And I suspect there are many

01:47.187 --> 01:58.915
thousand youngsters all over the world that owe 
you a great debt of gratitude for the help you gave

01:47.187 --> 01:58.915
them in their basic courses. I believe that's 
true, and I hope you don't misunderstand me. I hear

02:03.506 --> 02:03.947
you.
