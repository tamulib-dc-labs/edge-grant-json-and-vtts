WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:09.428
And for example, we've already addressed this 
question about integration of the services. As

00:09.589 --> 00:19.042
far as you're concerned, it was a very good move to 
integrate the services and have integrated

00:09.589 --> 00:19.042
units. What about women in the service? Now, women 
have expanded rapidly since the 1960s. And now I

00:24.890 --> 00:28.414
guess they're, I can't remember what percent. I 
think about 12% was it to the military? What's your

00:32.617 --> 00:33.398
opinion? I think it's good. I really do. Because I 
think there are many, many billets in the military

00:35.320 --> 00:43.769
that can adequately be filled by women. I don't see 
women in a combat role. I don't want to see women

00:48.134 --> 00:53.960
flying fighter aircraft, even though they're 
capable of doing it. I can see women flying

00:54.981 --> 00:58.945
transport aircraft. I think they're probably 
easy, probably 10% of the spaces in the military

00:59.701 --> 01:10.713
can be adequately filled by women. I'm all for it. I 
really am. If we do have selective service in the

01:14.838 --> 01:20.264
future, do you think women should be drafted?

01:23.167 --> 01:27.652
Well, with all the pressure on ERA, they want to do 
their thing. Yeah, I think so. I really do. I think

01:32.082 --> 01:34.706
some of them would feel slighted if they weren't 
drafted. Okay. What about the idea of the draft

01:37.331 --> 01:40.396
itself? Do you support reinstituting the draft? 
Do you think the voluntary service has failed? I

01:45.546 --> 01:50.675
think the voluntary service to a great extent has 
failed. It's improved a little bit recently. But I

01:53.937 --> 02:05.483
think that to an overall extent, I think the 
volunteer strength has failed because we don't

01:53.937 --> 02:05.483
have the level of competency in our enlisted 
personnel today in the volunteer army that we

02:05.885 --> 02:10.932
ought to have. The weapon systems and everything 
has become exceedingly more complicated and more

02:11.934 --> 02:19.225
sophisticated. Even our logistics systems where 
we're preparing a requisition

02:19.385 --> 02:33.225
on a computer where we're getting a computer 
transmitted requisition and a printout And

02:33.745 --> 02:40.075
everything is very sophisticated, and even 
automated warehouses. Well, you've got to have

02:40.736 --> 02:49.610
somebody with a level of intelligence and a level 
of competency that can respond to that.

02:49.730 --> 02:52.935
Otherwise, you're going to create chaos. So I 
think that the volunteer army from that

02:53.523 --> 02:59.590
standpoint has failed. The volunteer army has 
been responsible, and I'm not speaking in a

03:01.312 --> 03:22.095
prejudiced vein when I say this, for bringing in a 
real high percentage of black personnel who just

03:01.312 --> 03:22.095
have not had maybe the opportunity for education 
and training that their that the average cut of the

03:22.598 --> 03:26.985
white young man has had. For the result, we've got a 
lot of uneducated blacks in the service that are

03:27.806 --> 03:42.047
just not capable of running even a sophisticated 
vehicle like a tank that's got a little computer in

03:27.806 --> 03:42.047
it. The new Abrams tank has a computer. The fire 
control is computer directed. And hell, you've

03:47.877 --> 03:56.129
got to have somebody with at least a high school 
education to understand and operate the thing.

03:56.149 --> 04:04.641
High school plus a 12-week tech military 
schooling course to be able to even function the

03:56.149 --> 04:04.641
thing. So I think that we ought to have a draft. And I 
think it's got to be better run than it was before.

04:14.805 --> 04:29.127
We had too many possibilities for deferment to 
where it was strictly a poor man's draft or

04:14.805 --> 04:29.127
somebody that wasn't in graduate school or 
college that could get a deferment. And those are

04:30.389 --> 04:34.095
tough questions. And they're unpopular 
questions. But that's my basic feeling about

04:38.063 --> 04:41.228
them. Okay, let's ask some of the same questions 
about what's happened in Texas A&M during the

04:41.608 --> 04:52.584
1960s, which happened, of course, under the 
Rutter regime. How about ending the mandatory

04:53.005 --> 04:56.690
Corps of Cadets? What's your feeling toward that? 
I think sooner or later it had to come with the

05:00.716 --> 05:06.585
attitude of the country, you know? And because we 
went a long way anti-military, a lot of schools

05:07.814 --> 05:18.215
that had ROTCs for a hundred years abandoned them 
like Harvard, places like that. I think it had to

05:19.617 --> 05:22.303
come sooner or later. I hated to see it come, but I 
think it had to come. And I don't really

05:32.435 --> 05:38.066
I wish they would make a stronger effort to have a 
stronger core and a little bigger core. But I guess

05:38.968 --> 05:43.416
the core now is about the same size it was when I was 
in school. We had about 3,000, a little under 3,000

05:45.400 --> 05:49.207
when I was in school. It's about 2,300 now?

05:57.241 --> 05:59.324
I think it had to come sooner or later. What about 
admitting women are blacks? I think it's okay.

06:08.175 --> 06:17.806
I think the growth at Texas A&M has been, maybe it 
hasn't had time to digest the growth that they had,

06:08.175 --> 06:17.806
but it's been dynamic and massive. And I think it is 
really on the threshold of being one of the major

06:23.667 --> 06:32.779
institutions in the country from an academic 
standpoint and many other standpoints. Finally,

06:33.740 --> 06:39.007
let's talk about one other topic that the 
military's written volumes on, and that's

06:33.740 --> 06:39.007
leadership. The what? The military's written 
volumes on, and that's leadership. Yeah. If you

06:45.656 --> 06:52.965
were going down to Texas A&M and invited to give the 
Corps of Cadets a lecture on how to become a leader,

06:53.232 --> 06:54.093
What would you tell them? What would I tell them?

07:02.186 --> 07:04.910
What I'd tell them first, they have to be able to 
lead themselves. They have to have, they have to

07:06.393 --> 07:11.721
have values that they feel that they can live by. 
They have to have the courage of their

07:11.761 --> 07:17.430
convictions. They have to have a sense of humility 
and a sense of feeling to respect the dignity of

07:22.409 --> 07:35.986
everybody that they're associated with and 
everybody in their command, if they're going to

07:22.409 --> 07:35.986
command. Because every mortal, I think, has a 
personal human dignity that should be respected.

07:46.178 --> 07:49.362
And then I think they've got to exude

07:52.362 --> 08:21.981
effort and extra effort and above all I think 
you've got to be honest and you've got to have

07:52.362 --> 08:21.981
personal integrity it's hard to define you know 
what the principles of leadership are but I think

07:52.362 --> 08:21.981
if you have your own values in order and know what 
you want to do with yourself I believe you can lead

08:22.788 --> 08:26.494
others if you can lead yourself. What type of 
leader were you? Well, I think I was a pretty good

08:31.422 --> 08:33.205
leader. A lot of people would say, I know many times 
I'd have guys tell me, God damn, you're sure a

08:34.968 --> 08:40.917
salesman. You can, in a meeting, you can just sell 
these guys and make them do anything and they'll

08:40.958 --> 08:47.027
just follow you to hell. You can make a million 
dollars being a salesman. And maybe I was a

08:51.104 --> 08:57.333
salesman, maybe I was a con man, but I didn't feel 
like it. I felt sincere in what I was doing. And of

09:01.519 --> 09:04.763
course there's some old cliches about 
leadership. Don't ask anybody to do anything that

09:04.803 --> 09:09.049
you wouldn't do yourself. I think that's a little 
bit true, but sometimes as a leader, particularly

09:09.169 --> 09:15.458
in the military, You are put in a position 
sometimes of asking people to do things that you

09:16.248 --> 09:26.464
can't do yourself or you're not in a position to do 
yourself. So maybe that cliche doesn't apply

09:27.665 --> 09:38.181
universally, but I think basically a leader ought 
to be one that could easily say, follow me or

09:27.665 --> 09:38.181
something like that. When looking back over your 
military career, Was there a certain position

09:42.961 --> 09:58.424
that you thought was the highlight, a certain 
place where you felt that this is, this is it, I'm

09:42.961 --> 09:58.424
really doing my greatest accomplishments are 
here at this, at this moment? Was, was, what was

09:58.605 --> 09:59.967
that? What job was that or when was that? In 
Germany, the Gießen, particularly during the

10:01.970 --> 10:06.396
airlift.

10:08.540 --> 10:08.800
Yeah. Looking back over your life, everybody has 
accomplishments and everybody has

10:10.467 --> 10:21.922
shortcomings. In your military career, what do 
you think were the accomplishments and what were

10:22.744 --> 10:27.189
the shortcomings? Something that you couldn't 
finish the job or you just couldn't get done or

10:27.230 --> 10:35.040
maybe it wasn't your fault, but you just couldn't 
do it.

10:43.188 --> 10:44.289
it's hard to say. Like I say, I use an expression 
from Churchill, I think that during the Berlin

10:45.972 --> 10:54.723
Airlift was my finest hour as far as that's 
concerned. But I think the biggest

10:55.885 --> 11:11.085
accomplishment I made

10:55.885 --> 11:11.085
was really, and it may not, we haven't, we've 
hardly talked about it, but I think it was aviation

11:11.538 --> 11:13.060
fuel safety. I really believe that. And my name is 
not on that many regulations that have been

11:16.985 --> 11:40.296
perpetuated and my name is not associated with 
that many manuals because no military man's name

11:16.985 --> 11:40.296
is in any manuals, but I think I really made an 
impact on the safety of aviation fuels and the

11:41.153 --> 12:03.555
safety of all fuels, but particularly aviation 
fuels, that has made a significant impact in

11:41.153 --> 12:03.555
military aviation, safety in military aviation, 
and the spill-off in commercial aviation. Are you

12:03.715 --> 12:04.336
sure? I think that's really the biggest If I was 
going to look back on it, like maybe in the

12:08.255 --> 12:17.825
hereafter, St. Peter would say, well what was the 
best thing you did? I think that's what I'd tell

12:17.845 --> 12:21.109
him. What about shortcomings?

12:24.552 --> 12:38.127
The shortcomings, the biggest frustration I had 
in the shortcomings was in Japan, where those old

12:24.552 --> 12:38.127
Japanese facilities, they were beautiful, but 
they were antiquated in that there was only one

12:38.377 --> 12:50.729
six-inch line into and out of these huge 
underground storage tanks. And to discharge a

12:50.749 --> 13:07.725
tanker into one of those things, particularly a 
modern, and we began to get the first of the super

12:50.749 --> 13:07.725
tankers in those days, the Orion class that had 
300,000 barrels on them, it would take us 72 hours

13:07.925 --> 13:22.423
to discharge that tanker because of just one entry 
into it only one line coming off whereas the

13:07.925 --> 13:22.423
demurrage it costs six seven thousand dollars a 
day for that tanker to sit there and pump off So I

13:23.652 --> 13:35.552
immediately started to scrounge pipe and 
scrounge everything and put more entries into the

13:23.652 --> 13:35.552
tanks so that we could put four or five hoses on 
these tankers. And I finally got several of the

13:36.534 --> 13:48.394
terminals worked up to where we could discharge 
one of those little mini super tankers in about 12

13:36.534 --> 13:48.394
hours to where the crews would just rebel because 
they'd generally think they're gonna have three

13:48.762 --> 14:08.509
or four days of liberty after they got from the 
Middle East to shack up in Japan and we were ready

13:48.762 --> 14:08.509
for them to turn around in 12 hours and then I 
replaced a pipeline on the beach and but I ran

13:48.762 --> 14:08.509
constantly into into command problems they 
wouldn't wouldn't let me use the pipe and this

14:08.675 --> 14:35.408
regulation and that regulation and several times 
i violated the regulations and they'd send the ig

14:08.675 --> 14:35.408
down and make an investigation and he'd always 
side with me and it was a very frustrating thing and

14:08.675 --> 14:35.408
i was not able to finish what i wanted to do over 
there to really make them into efficient

14:36.097 --> 15:01.716
petroleum handling operation I was able to get 
about four of the terminals converted and they've

14:36.097 --> 15:01.716
since in the four, five, eight, ten years 
afterwards I left there about putting out finally

14:36.097 --> 15:01.716
on contract and everything they were able to 
modernize some of them but at a considerable

14:36.097 --> 15:01.716
expense and we could have done it with our own 
in-house personnel because we had it all

14:36.097 --> 15:01.716
engineered. We had figured it in the hydraulics of 
it and everything and The excess pipe was there,

15:05.172 --> 15:14.686
left over from Korea, and all we had to do was get it 
over there and use the GIs and the Japanese to do it.

15:15.267 --> 15:19.813
And this was the most frustrating thing that I had. 
Well, we've talked about your early years, your

15:19.833 --> 15:28.586
education, military career, and something about 
your retirement, your views on the military and on

15:19.833 --> 15:28.586
A&M. Is there something else that I've missed? No, 
no. I... I believe, and I'm kind of a workaholic, I

15:34.315 --> 15:37.440
guess. I've been called that by my wife and others. 
Well, that's obvious because you're one of the

15:40.826 --> 15:51.023
very few men that I've met who have been retired 
that have a full-time job, especially a man who's

15:40.826 --> 15:51.023
70. I'll be 70 in December and I plan to

15:58.312 --> 16:04.401
I would like to continue, the good Lord willing, 
what I'm doing now for, you know, five or six more

15:58.312 --> 16:04.401
years. I know men who are generals and are 55 and 
they play golf three times a week and that's all.

16:11.211 --> 16:14.355
Most of them will be dead in about another five or 
six years, too. Well, that could be. But I've met,

16:17.240 --> 16:23.769
I've interviewed a number of those men and they 
don't seem to have very many interests. I feel

16:23.849 --> 16:26.513
sorry for them because they're They're out of the 
mainstream, and they're making no contribution

16:26.915 --> 16:32.363
to the society today. And it can be very 
satisfying, as well as rewarding.

16:40.374 --> 16:46.442
And I'm not pretentious or anything, but I've done 
very well. And it's been very financially

16:47.644 --> 16:49.887
rewarding. And I'm not crazy about money.

16:57.982 --> 16:59.824
I enjoy it. I spend it wisely and I give to the arts. I 
support the arts and charity. I really feel sorry

17:06.951 --> 17:14.239
for these guys that retire and sit on their ass and 
think the world owes them a living. I'd like to say

17:15.360 --> 17:22.487
that, and I can say as of this point in time right 
now, that since I've retired, I've paid on the

17:24.087 --> 17:30.497
average of at least twice as much in income tax as 
I've received in retired pay. And last year, it was

17:31.498 --> 17:33.762
considerably more than that.

17:36.706 --> 17:44.999
And it's

17:36.706 --> 17:44.999
kind of a good feeling.

17:48.064 --> 17:51.529
That's unusual for a man to say that paying high 
taxes is a good feeling, especially when we have so

17:51.863 --> 17:58.473
many people in Washington today denying that they 
have... It's a good feeling to know that you're

17:58.493 --> 18:08.728
able to do it and that you're able, that you have the 
good fortune and the good health to be able to do it.

18:08.969 --> 18:09.950
To be so productive. To be productive enough and to 
enjoy what you're doing and still not be chagrined

18:10.211 --> 18:17.161
by it. And I don't... don't you know I think of 
course I think some taxes and can get to where

18:20.264 --> 18:49.663
they're prohibitive and almost confiscatory but 
I think sometimes it's it's a privilege to be able

18:20.264 --> 18:49.663
to pay to pay taxes if you're able to make it and make 
it fairly and squarely so I don't want to do

18:20.264 --> 18:49.663
anything that's immoral or illegal And I have not 
done anything that's immoral or illegal. And this

18:54.480 --> 18:59.426
is the way that I want to conduct my business. It's 
the way I tried to conduct my military career. But I

19:04.834 --> 19:10.421
really feel sorry for those goddamn senior guys 
that retire. And some of them, nearly all of them,

19:10.501 --> 19:15.488
want to get a job right after they retire. But they 
want to be handed a job making $50,000 a year.

19:19.900 --> 19:28.271
sitting at a big fancy desk in a big fancy office 
with a few papers coming in and out and not getting

19:19.900 --> 19:28.271
their hands dirty. This is what their thought is. 
And you can't do it. And I was handed a job like that

19:33.617 --> 19:43.550
with Scott Paper, but I was constantly on the go and 
down in the plants and everything. And it was kind

19:43.610 --> 19:48.456
of tough to come into an organization at the vice 
president level, when guys that had been working

19:49.128 --> 19:56.899
for 20 years that weren't vice presidents, it was 
kind of tough. And it was a lot of strained

19:56.959 --> 20:00.304
feelings. And I had to make friends and influence 
people. I had to use Dale Carnegie techniques. And

20:07.774 --> 20:09.998
I succeeded in a lot of cases. There were two or 
three guys I never did make much headway with. But I

20:13.823 --> 20:18.730
enjoyed it, and I think it really primed me be able 
to go then to a small business.

20:24.555 --> 20:25.917
Well, thanks a lot for this interview. Okay, well 
it's been fun. I haven't had the opportunity to

20:27.539 --> 20:41.960
purge myself of some of these thoughts in a long, 
long time, and I hope it will sound interesting

20:27.539 --> 20:41.960
enough for you to use. Oh, yeah.
