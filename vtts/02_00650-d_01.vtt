00:09.211 --> 00:13.636
So as far as you were concerned, then the campus 
ought to be located as close to Scripps as

00:09.211 --> 00:13.636
possible. That's right.

00:17.461 --> 00:33.940
And the alternative, as I say, was that they would 
put the School of Science and Engineering here on

00:17.461 --> 00:33.940
the 50 acres of land the city had given them and put 
the university somewhere else, the big new

00:17.461 --> 00:33.940
university campus.

00:34.140 --> 00:36.383
But I had several reasons for thinking this. One 
was that I thought it would be good for the Scripps

00:39.080 --> 00:44.367
Institution. Another was that the beautiful site 
was by far the most handsome site

00:45.688 --> 00:55.261
in the whole area. And the third was that the 
existence of the Scripps Institution would give

00:55.281 --> 01:01.288
credibility to the whole enterprise. This was a 
great place and a well-known, worldwide known

01:01.308 --> 01:08.277
place, so it would be easier to recruit faculty.

01:11.024 --> 01:18.634
Now, the great antagonist of this position was one 
of the regents, a man named Ed Pauley. Ed who?

01:19.135 --> 01:21.258
Pauley, P-A-U-L-E-Y. Okay.

01:24.983 --> 01:29.108
And he just really didn't want to have a campus in 
San Diego at all. He never actually said that

01:30.971 --> 01:36.238
because other regents were pretty enthusiastic 
about it. And it would have been

01:38.716 --> 01:46.728
counterproductive, from his political point of 
view, it would have been counterproductive to

01:38.716 --> 01:46.728
mount a frontal attack on the new campus. So he 
proposed that it be in Balboa Park.

01:53.978 --> 02:01.489
Balboa Park is the crown jewel of San Diego, sort of 
like Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. And the

02:01.509 --> 02:06.917
people of San Diego wouldn't give it up for 
anything, let alone for the university, because

02:01.509 --> 02:06.917
they don't understand.

02:10.103 --> 02:15.329
So that was just obviously a ploy on his part. The 
second ploy was after it was more or less agreed by,

02:15.349 --> 02:30.647
it was not agreed, but I was enthusiastic about it, 
and quite a few other people were to have it there

02:15.349 --> 02:30.647
where it is now.

02:33.571 --> 02:38.777
The second ploy was that the airplane noise level 
would be too high because of the Miramar Naval Air

02:33.571 --> 02:38.777
Station.

02:42.149 --> 02:46.255
My assistant director was a man named Charles 
Wheelock. Charles DeLorma Wheelock, retired

02:46.275 --> 02:52.905
admiral, Bureau of Ships type admiral, naval 
constructor. Kind of a funny guy to have an

02:55.469 --> 03:03.100
associate director of an oceanographic 
institution, but he just got seasick looking at

02:55.469 --> 03:03.100
the ocean. That's why he was a naval

03:03.120 --> 03:09.089
architect and not a line officer. But he was a An 
absolutely wonderful man. Modest, decent,

03:13.404 --> 03:19.770
honest, persuasive, bright, good guy. And I was 
just awfully lucky to con the Navy into letting me

03:19.790 --> 03:24.334
have him. Letting him retire early, come out here 
to script.

03:31.941 --> 03:35.364
I'd worked on this for years, getting him. And he 
was able to talk the people at Miramar into

03:35.384 --> 03:38.667
changing their flight patterns. instead of 
flying directly over Scripps, as they had done on

03:40.503 --> 04:05.297
their takeoff, they turned and made a sharp right 
turn and flew out over Torrey Pines Park, Torrey

03:40.503 --> 04:05.297
Pines State, that canyon between Torrey Pines and 
Del Mar,

03:40.503 --> 04:05.297
which is pretty hard on a General Dynamics 
laboratory, a General Atomics laboratory. It

04:05.397 --> 04:06.218
flew right over them.

04:09.783 --> 04:10.003
But We then, Jeff Crouchy particularly, measured 
lots of noise levels all over the Bose campus, and

04:11.198 --> 04:20.589
we showed that they were not really very bad.

04:23.252 --> 04:34.444
And we looked up other campuses that were under a 
flight pattern, like the University of

04:23.252 --> 04:34.444
Minnesota, and the University of Arizona, and the 
Riverside campus at the University of

04:23.252 --> 04:34.444
California. They all seemed to be getting along. 
But Paulie's a very serious fighter when he gets

04:39.953 --> 04:42.476
involved with something. He took the Regents out 
to his estate on Coconut Island in the middle of

04:42.516 --> 04:52.848
Kaneohe Bay in Milwaukee. And about two miles from 
his house there, his estate, is a marine air

04:54.330 --> 05:01.758
station. And he got the commandant of that station 
to fly a flight of fighter planes right over his

05:06.599 --> 05:12.905
house at about 200 feet and turn off their 
afterburners, just as they got over the house. And

05:14.486 --> 05:17.249
this scared the Regis to death, as you can imagine. 
It's like an explosion. It

05:19.211 --> 05:26.698
was awful. Pereira was a very good guy, Del 
Pereira. Charles Luckman was a former president

05:29.740 --> 05:34.665
of the Lieber Brothers and essentially a social. 
He also had a degree in architecture, I guess. But

05:38.845 --> 05:40.887
he was basically a salesman. And by this time, they 
had split up after this search had been going on for

05:40.907 --> 05:49.374
years over a new campus. And Luckman, being a very 
political type and knowing that Poly was the most

05:49.394 --> 06:01.726
powerful region, found all sorts of reasons why we 
shouldn't have the campus here. He said it might

06:02.146 --> 06:05.209
cost $20 million more for noise protection. 
Unfortunately, he was also the architect for the

06:06.623 --> 06:19.157
Scripps Memorial Hospital, which had a site about 
two miles closer to Miramar than we were and much

06:06.623 --> 06:19.157
closer to the flight pad as we were. And he wrote a 
letter to the administrator of the hospital

06:19.178 --> 06:28.128
saying that airplane noise would be no problem at 
this new site for the hospital. And the

06:29.610 --> 06:35.196
administrator said, one of the advantages of 
living in a place a long time is you get to know a lot

06:29.610 --> 06:35.196
of people pretty well. The administrator gave me a 
copy of this letter.

06:41.115 --> 06:47.362
It wasn't confidential, but I gave it to Clark 
Kerr. We had another meeting at Davis. This was

06:50.285 --> 06:52.748
about 1960, 1959, I guess.

06:55.732 --> 07:01.639
Ferreira and Luckman got up and told us about all 
this terrible noise problem here by the site. And

07:03.087 --> 07:07.451
Clark said, well, it's very interesting, but I 
have a letter here from you. You wrote to the

07:07.471 --> 07:10.554
administrator of the Scripps Hospital. There 
wouldn't be any noise

07:10.574 --> 07:15.618
about it. Oh, my. And the upshot was that the 
regents voted. Well, there were two upshots. One

07:24.185 --> 07:28.529
was that the regents voted 21 to 1 to locate the site 
in La Jolla. The other upshot was that I never

07:29.510 --> 07:31.812
became chancellor. was a period victory as far as I 
was concerned.

07:50.884 --> 07:53.287
I was the dean of the School of Science and 
Engineering. It's a paper organization. I was

07:54.688 --> 07:56.871
chief campus officer. I was responsible for 
making the plan, the academic plan for the

07:57.779 --> 08:07.213
university and recruiting people for it.

08:07.233 --> 08:11.220
So we had several principles, several ideas. The

08:11.240 --> 08:21.435
regions put all sorts of conditions on having this 
site here. One of the conditions was they should

08:21.455 --> 08:26.503
get 1,200 acres of land free and clear from 
somebody.

08:29.926 --> 08:47.580
Another condition was that there should be a 
university town, a university

08:29.926 --> 08:47.580
community built up and planned by the city in 
cooperation with the regents, with the Office of

08:29.926 --> 08:47.580
Architects and Engineers of the university.

08:53.534 --> 09:04.111
I think, I don't remember what other conditions 
there were, but those were the principles, the

08:53.534 --> 09:04.111
university plan, the plan for the region, and the 
land free and clear.

09:07.457 --> 09:18.715
So we had a campaign, a political campaign in San 
Diego, which the city of San Diego voted to give us

09:07.457 --> 09:18.715
something like 800 acres of land, Pueblo land, the 
same kind of land I told you about before, right

09:20.821 --> 09:29.835
next to the Scripps, with 180 acres of the Scripps 
Institution. I've forgotten the exact number.

09:32.980 --> 09:33.801
Maybe it was only 600. It was quite a large chunk of 
land.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.476
And then we started to work on the Marine Corps. 
Charles Wheelock, of course, contributed to the

09:43.957 --> 09:47.082
omen service there. The Marine Corps really had to 
move because they were such a nuisance. It was a

09:51.944 --> 09:58.470
Marine Corps rifle range called Camp Matthews.

09:58.490 --> 09:59.911
And eventually, we got from the Navy. The Navy 
agreed to turn over Camp Matthews

09:59.951 --> 10:06.918
to the University. We got 1,200 acres of land 
clear.

10:14.785 --> 10:17.608
And they also, the city cooperated handsomely in 
the planning of the whole region because of

10:18.162 --> 10:30.599
something called University City, and they now 
have a university town planned just east of the

10:18.162 --> 10:30.599
campus.

10:30.619 --> 10:47.663
The second idea was that,

10:30.619 --> 10:47.663
besides this first idea that it ought to be here, 
the second idea was that it ought to be primarily a

10:30.619 --> 10:47.663
research university, not necessarily 
primarily, but a strong emphasis on research and

10:30.619 --> 10:47.663
graduate instruction.

10:50.343 --> 10:53.306
And that therefore, it had to have outstanding 
research people.

10:57.050 --> 11:05.158
And that the way we would do this would be to build up 
one department at a time to critical mass.

11:05.178 --> 11:10.724
We would not start out with a faculty, an 
undergraduate faculty covering the waterfront.

11:10.904 --> 11:16.710
We would have just one department necessary to 
begin with, and another one, and another one. Each

11:16.730 --> 11:19.573
one good enough. of first-rate researchers in it 
to have a good doctoral program and a good chance of

11:21.258 --> 11:29.829
getting support for research from the federal 
government. They would support each other in

11:31.771 --> 11:40.862
ideas and in inspiration.

11:41.443 --> 11:47.931
That intellectual exchange is quite essential

11:41.443 --> 11:47.931
for research. Clark Kerr backed that 
wholeheartedly.

11:52.358 --> 12:03.671
So we did just that, and I got three people who were 
brilliant academic recruiters and organizers.

12:03.691 --> 12:12.241
Jim Arnold in chemistry, Keith Brooker in 
physics, and David Bonner in biology. They were

12:12.261 --> 12:18.889
all thrilled with the idea of building a new 
university, and with the idea that we'd do it this

12:12.261 --> 12:18.889
way and not simply Start from the bottom and build 
up. Start from the top and go down. Build a roof

12:23.542 --> 12:28.069
first, as we used

12:23.542 --> 12:28.069
to call it. And they all had a whole list of first 
grade people that they knew, many of whom were

12:28.089 --> 12:34.398
young and not very well known. They thought it 
would be good to have here, and they all went to town

12:34.418 --> 12:40.007
and persuaded them. Iowa, of course, did a great 
deal of this. In a sense, everybody that would come

12:43.372 --> 12:47.037
here, we had a kind of a routine. We would talk about 
our ideas at the new university. And we'd draw

12:52.983 --> 13:02.618
diagrams, and we'd talk about the idea they were 
going to tell you about in a

12:52.983 --> 13:02.618
minute. And I'd take people up and show them where 
the campus was going to be. There was a pile on it

13:05.322 --> 13:09.468
that they left over from the days when it was an Army 
camp. There was a pillar that supported the roof,

13:11.171 --> 13:14.476
and it was still standing there. And there was a 
fallen chimney right next to it. I'd get people to

13:17.442 --> 13:23.230
stand on top of this fallen chimney, and you could 
see it for about two miles in every direction. It

13:23.250 --> 13:24.011
was quite a sight. And we'd always have a party for 
them, and get the most interesting people we could

13:26.194 --> 13:31.181
find at this party. Everybody thought this was a 
dull place, and it was a dull place. But there were

13:35.286 --> 13:42.336
some interesting

13:35.286 --> 13:42.336
people here. A lot of people got excited about it. 
Of course, the more we got, the more we got. It was

13:46.841 --> 13:49.043
snowballing. One of our prime recruiting grounds 
was the University of Chicago. The reason for that

13:56.069 --> 14:04.757
was that Bob Hutchings, Bob Resting, had let the 
neighborhood deteriorate. It had become the

14:04.777 --> 14:07.119
center of a black ghetto.

14:09.461 --> 14:12.964
And these blacks were all played rough, played 
very rough. dangerous for a white man or a white

14:13.940 --> 14:21.087
woman to go out on the streets, even in the daytime, 
alone at night. So that's one of the principal

14:21.107 --> 14:25.991
reasons why Harold Urey came here, Harold and 
Freda Urey.

14:29.234 --> 14:42.587
And then we got Joe Mayer and his wife, Maria Mayer, 
later, after she came here, won a Nobel Prize from

14:29.234 --> 14:42.587
the University of Chicago.

14:42.607 --> 14:43.508
Several other people. Bonner himself came from 
Yale and Brooker from the University of

14:45.209 --> 14:48.553
Pennsylvania.

14:53.318 --> 15:03.328
And Brooker emphasized

14:53.318 --> 15:03.328
mainly solid state physics. He got half a dozen top 
people in solid state physics. That was

15:07.713 --> 15:10.256
essentially a new field. There were Matias and 
Harry Sewell and

15:18.149 --> 15:20.212
Walter Cohn were three of them. Then you got Norman 
Crowe, theoretical physicist. He himself is a

15:22.655 --> 15:28.864
theoretical nuclear physicist.

15:28.884 --> 15:32.809
And most of these people were between 30 and 40 
years old. Any of them worked for the Bell Labs.

15:35.093 --> 15:37.957
That was another prime recruit down there. I had a 
principal, quote, principal, end quote. He would

15:42.022 --> 15:46.148
not pay anybody a higher salary than the salary he 
was getting where he was. on the theory that if you

15:47.512 --> 15:52.817
could buy people, somebody else could buy them 
away from you. Well, that's a high-sounding

15:52.897 --> 15:54.579
theory, all right. The fact is that people who came 
here from the Bell Labs just about doubled their

15:54.599 --> 16:04.708
salary because they were able to consult here in 
the summertime. Working for the Bell Labs, if they

16:04.728 --> 16:08.411
got $23,000 a year, pretty good salary. That's all 
they got. They couldn't consult at all. Here, if

16:12.055 --> 16:14.397
they got it, we offered them $23,000. Now you're 
$15,000, $20,000 in the summertime consulting.

16:20.601 --> 16:25.206
So really, Keith never told me this. But I found 
out. I eventually caught on. Keith was always in

16:30.532 --> 16:40.304
favor of paying people as much as you could 
possibly pay.

16:40.704 --> 16:42.426
This was his principle. It wasn't a question of 
stealing people or buying them. It was a question

16:45.212 --> 16:48.475
that they deserved a high income. They were good 
physicists. That's what good physicists should

16:49.316 --> 17:02.588
have, is high income.

17:02.608 --> 17:12.497
And we got some very good people in the earth 
sciences, some very good people in biology, very

17:02.608 --> 17:12.497
good people in both chemistry and physics. Proof 
of the pudding is that now,

17:15.143 --> 17:29.839
15 years later, something like 45 members of the 
National Academy of Sciences are on this campus.

17:29.859 --> 17:36.206
That's the only two or three universities in the 
country that have a higher number. Harvard has.

17:36.487 --> 17:39.290
The University of California at Berkeley has. And 
that's about it. Or Rockefeller University. Jet

17:42.869 --> 17:46.613
Bronk and I used to compare notes all the time. He 
wanted to do what I, he was doing what I really would

17:46.633 --> 17:50.798
have liked to do, but couldn't do.

17:53.882 --> 18:00.350
Building up primarily a small graduate

17:53.882 --> 18:00.350
school. They've got Nobel Prize winners running 
out over here at Rockefeller University. Every

18:04.995 --> 18:07.879
other guy you see is a Nobel Prize winner. And 
they're all members of the National Academy of

18:07.899 --> 18:12.184
Science. But you know, we did pretty well

18:12.805 --> 18:20.074
under the circumstances. And the most important 
thing that I did, without really realizing it, was

18:20.094 --> 18:28.524
to find a first rate library. I was pushed hard on 
that by people who come from regular

18:30.046 --> 18:35.273
universities. So I would back places like the 
Scripps Institution. They thought a library was

18:40.143 --> 18:41.665
very important. And it is very important. It's 
terribly important. We got a man from Kent, a

18:46.249 --> 19:07.511
librarian at the University of Kent, named Mel 
Boyd,

18:46.249 --> 19:07.511
who's built up really an impossible job of 
building up a pretty good library here in 15 years

18:46.249 --> 19:07.511
with very inadequate resources. Got well over a 
million volumes.

19:12.003 --> 19:13.065
about a million and a half.

19:16.230 --> 19:26.025
It's divided into five different libraries, the 
Central Library, the Science and Engineering

19:16.230 --> 19:26.025
Library, the Scripps Institution Library, the 
Undergraduate Library, and the Medical,

19:16.230 --> 19:26.025
Biomedical Library. Each of these is a model of 
organization and management and service, plus

19:27.107 --> 19:36.682
having the books and the journals.

19:36.702 --> 19:38.685
The way I got started on this was that when it was 
planned to have these three new campuses, he

19:40.015 --> 19:50.609
volunteered to collect an undergraduate library 
for all three of them in duplicate.

19:50.629 --> 19:55.957
Since he was on the ground and the other two 
campuses had really gotten started yet. We were

19:56.057 --> 19:57.539
started because we had scripts.

20:00.142 --> 20:00.944
He did just that. He got 75,000 volumes in 
triplicate. He gave one to Santa Cruz, one to

20:05.490 --> 20:07.913
Irvine, and we have one here. The Regents were so 
impressed by this that for a few years they gave him

20:08.922 --> 20:16.410
almost everything he wanted by the university 
administration.

20:20.234 --> 20:24.179
The second chancellor here was a man named John 
Galbraith. And he

20:24.199 --> 20:32.668
was a historian and very much aware of the 
necessity of a research library for humanists,

20:33.863 --> 20:43.714
more so for humanists than either for natural 
scientists or social scientists. So he pushed the

20:43.734 --> 20:45.696
library very hard, too. Clark Kerr was his

20:47.058 --> 20:57.229
longtime friend, and he got Clark quite 
sympathetic with it, too. Unfortunately, Clark

20:57.449 --> 21:00.833
got fired. Clark used to say, I entered my job and 
left it the same way, fired with enthusiasm.

21:12.030 --> 21:20.158
But the

21:12.030 --> 21:20.158
thing which we used to attract people, the idea we 
used to attract people, and it was a very good idea.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.201
We really had three ideas. One of them was that we 
would divide the place up into colleges, not

21:24.062 --> 21:30.448
Oxbridge-type small colleges, primarily 
undergraduate teaching institutions, but

21:31.120 --> 21:40.411
essentially little universities side by side, 
universities of about 2,000 students. And we plan

21:40.451 --> 21:47.699
to have 12 of them, 2,000 25-minute students, 1 
third of graduates and 2 thirds undergraduates.

21:47.719 --> 21:51.924
It's a mix, I

21:47.719 --> 21:51.924
thought. And the reason for this was that each 
college could be semi-autonomous, could provide

21:51.944 --> 22:00.013
a liberal education in all branches of human 
thought. And at the same time, the faculty would be

22:03.807 --> 22:14.584
small enough so they could think and act, and not 
only react, which is the way it was at Berkeley,

22:03.807 --> 22:14.584
because the faculty was so goddamn big.

22:14.604 --> 22:18.210
Berkeley has traditionally been run by the 
faculty, but they don't really run it. You never

22:18.410 --> 22:20.814
get any ideas put across. It's impossible to 
experiment with a faculty of 3,000 people or

22:21.895 --> 22:26.102
something.

22:31.955 --> 22:37.782
Well, my idea was to have maybe 150 to 200 people as 
the faculty of each of these little universities.

22:37.802 --> 22:46.073
And they would be able to sneak up their own 
curriculum and their own requirements and their

22:37.802 --> 22:46.073
own programs. And they would be different. You'd 
be sure that they were different by the kind of

22:49.177 --> 22:53.482
people you get for each one. The first college I 
thought of as essentially a place to produce

22:53.502 --> 22:59.790
graduate students. In other words, a scholarly 
place. Not just in science, but in humanities and

23:01.503 --> 23:08.471
social sciences as well as in natural sciences. I 
thought of the second one as perhaps a place to

23:08.491 --> 23:24.069
produce artists and people related to artists, 
like architects,

23:08.491 --> 23:24.069
journalists, writers.

23:24.109 --> 23:27.493
The third college would be perhaps a graduate 
school a school of business administration, a

23:27.980 --> 23:38.151
fourth maybe a school of law, undergraduate, 
pushed in that direction towards administration

23:27.980 --> 23:38.151
or government. And you could have a somewhat 
different set of departments in each one. Each set

23:43.737 --> 23:47.041
of departments, however, would cover the 
waterfront of human knowledge. And one you'd

23:48.262 --> 23:50.985
have, say, traditional biology. This would be the 
one that emphasized art. Because the great

23:53.768 --> 23:57.312
motivation of the traditional biologist It's 
beauty. It's the aesthetics of organisms. In our

24:02.110 --> 24:11.204
first college, the graduate school college, we'd 
have high-powered experimental biology. So it's

24:11.224 --> 24:20.599
different when we have ecology, applied biology, 
leading towards, say, government management.

24:24.578 --> 24:26.120
You have different kinds of earth science. 
There's different kinds of physics, solid state

24:26.140 --> 24:36.173
physics in one, theoretical physics in another, 
hydrodynamics in a third, and so forth. Well, this

24:36.193 --> 24:39.917
didn't work out, but it sounded good. And 
everybody, all professors traditionally

24:39.937 --> 24:53.134
deplored apartments. They're enthusiastic 
about multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary

24:55.055 --> 25:01.184
studies on paper. In fact, they don't give a damn 
about interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary

25:01.324 --> 25:06.512
studies. And they love departments,

25:06.532 --> 25:12.801
as you know. But they thought it would be nice to try 
it the other way.

25:21.113 --> 25:24.117
My second idea was that we should emphasize 
creativity in the arts rather than criticism. In

25:28.179 --> 25:46.527
other words, we have musicians and painters and 
actors and playwrights and scene and stage

25:28.179 --> 25:46.527
designers

25:28.179 --> 25:46.527
and sculptors and composers and musicians, 
performing musicians, not people who wrote about

25:28.179 --> 25:46.527
what other people did in the arts.

25:50.945 --> 26:00.714
In other words, our humanities would be the 
complement of the sciences in the sense that they

25:50.945 --> 26:00.714
would be creative rather than critical. One of the 
reasons for that was we didn't have much of a

26:00.734 --> 26:03.317
library. It couldn't be very critical.

26:08.682 --> 26:14.167
Third idea was that we'd mix up the graduates and 
the undergraduates.

26:14.227 --> 26:18.471
The undergraduates would get in contact with 
research just as soon as they possibly could.

26:19.463 --> 26:31.217
Because I said, and Glenn Seaborg said, and many of 
us agree, that the object of a college education is

26:19.463 --> 26:31.217
to learn how to learn, not to learn something, but 
to learn how to learn. Because times are changing

26:31.897 --> 26:40.908
so fast, nothing that you learn makes much sense 10 
years later.

26:40.928 --> 26:47.175
So therefore, we would try to get the 
undergraduates involved with research, and we

26:40.928 --> 26:47.175
wanted to get the graduates involved with breadth 
of learning that you get with contact with the

26:48.590 --> 26:55.078
humanities and the social sciences if you're in 
the natural sciences. Not necessarily in

26:55.098 --> 26:59.863
courses, but in seminars and informal 
activities. So we wanted to have each college have

26:59.883 --> 27:07.052
a mix of graduates and undergraduates.

27:07.072 --> 27:16.082
Well,

27:07.072 --> 27:16.082
I guess none of these ideas have really worked out 
exactly.

27:20.078 --> 27:24.207
colleges have turned out to be places that are 
primarily different in their undergraduate

27:20.078 --> 27:24.207
curriculum.

27:27.454 --> 27:30.140
And they do have some differences in the 
undergraduate curriculum. And the students

27:30.160 --> 27:33.047
think it's great to belong to a college. As far as I 
can make out, they do. That's what the faculty

27:37.096 --> 27:40.062
members tell me.

27:46.117 --> 27:54.125
But as far as the graduates mixing with the 
undergraduates are concerned, that just doesn't

27:46.117 --> 27:54.125
happen

27:46.117 --> 27:54.125
very much. The departments are university-wide 
departments. They don't belong to the college.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.234
They belong to the university. They serve all the 
colleges, and they have a life of their

28:02.274 --> 28:09.742
own. It is true that we have a lot of creative art 
here. Not necessarily a good thing. Because the

28:15.631 --> 28:18.574
creative artists are all wild artists, as you can 
imagine. That's what art nowadays amounts to, is

28:18.594 --> 28:23.019
something most people don't understand.

28:27.724 --> 28:36.513
The one idea that did work out pretty well, and very 
well, in fact, was the idea of building from the top

28:27.724 --> 28:36.513
down and building department by department. And 
we have a series of very good departments, not

28:36.533 --> 28:42.239
necessarily very broad departments. For 
example, our economists are all

28:42.300 --> 28:44.642
econometricians. Now, God knows what 
econometricians do in the modern world, but

28:46.276 --> 28:53.085
that's what our guys do anyhow. And our 
psychologists are all experimental

28:53.105 --> 29:00.074
psychologists.

29:00.094 --> 29:02.918
Nevertheless, they're good. We have a group of 
young, enthusiastic political scientists and a

29:03.458 --> 29:09.506
group of anthropologists.

29:13.451 --> 29:16.215
I think we've failed in linguistics, more or less. 
I'm not sure we're very good in comparative

29:16.803 --> 29:19.526
literature. We're very good in basic sciences. 
Pretty good in mathematics. I guess fair in

29:27.556 --> 29:28.998
philosophy. I'm not sure

29:29.018 --> 29:35.906
about that.

29:39.150 --> 29:46.759
And so I guess that

29:39.150 --> 29:46.759
the only thing that really is a sort of a permanent 
relic or a permanent residue of these great ideas

29:48.055 --> 30:01.416
is the college, is the university's

29:48.055 --> 30:01.416
physical structure. The dormitories and the 
academic buildings for each college are right

30:01.436 --> 30:06.624
together. And we have three of, four of them now. 
Revelle College, your college, what's called

30:10.590 --> 30:14.957
third college, what's called fourth.
