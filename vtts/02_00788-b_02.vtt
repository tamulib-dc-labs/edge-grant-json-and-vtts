00:00.031 --> 00:09.519
When

00:00.031 --> 00:09.519
did you first meet Dr. Francis?

00:12.182 --> 00:21.850
When he taught me a course in Veterinary Anatomy 
when I was a junior in animal husbandry. That was in

00:21.870 --> 00:29.937
the year 21-22.

00:31.486 --> 00:33.929
He was a little different than the usual one.

00:39.075 --> 00:41.899
He would have been a pretty good one for the stage, I 
think. He did everything in pantomime. And he

00:46.084 --> 00:49.508
could imitate a horse with a string halt to 
perfection. He'd drag that leg across

00:49.909 --> 00:57.779
the room. Or a lame horse. And he'd show how they 
acted, but he was just a comic as far as a lecture.

01:14.999 --> 01:28.695
Later, a number of years later, I heard a story that 
Dr. Bowden, who was dean from 48 to 53,

01:30.025 --> 01:34.829
When he was a senior student at Ohio State 
University, that's where Dr. Francis graduated.

01:34.850 --> 01:37.052
Dr. Francis graduated there in 87.

01:40.114 --> 01:54.368
When he was a senior student, he was a class of 16, 
and when he was a senior student, the dean at Ohio

01:40.114 --> 01:54.368
State invited Dr. Francis to lecture to the 
veterinary students. And he went up there for a

01:56.530 --> 01:58.952
week to lecture. And each succeeding day, well, 
they'd have business. And they'd get to growing

02:05.119 --> 02:08.443
and growing and growing. They wanted to see that 
little man, cute little man lecture. But he was a

02:15.411 --> 02:22.259
good lecturer, but did so much in pantomime. He was 
a good mimic.

02:27.785 --> 02:29.968
But the dean of engineering heard him. and talked 
him into staying over a whole week, mind you, and

02:31.231 --> 02:36.557
lectured to the engineering students. And they 
did the same thing, yes. What would he lecture to

02:40.542 --> 02:43.485
them about? Well, just, I don't know, but it was

02:43.505 --> 02:57.902
probably stories of one kind or another. He was 
interested in paleontology. He had a wide

03:02.011 --> 03:10.459
knowledge, but old citizenship and a little of 
everything. After

03:11.059 --> 03:22.250
he lost his hearing, he had influenza

03:11.059 --> 03:22.250
or something. I left him with very hard of hearing, 
and that was pretty... I don't know what year that

03:27.815 --> 03:29.617
happened. It was before my time. But he would buy a 
hearing device every time somebody had a new

03:32.993 --> 03:40.585
hearing device. He'd buy it, give it away. He 
wouldn't return it. He'd just give it away to

03:45.532 --> 03:47.235
somebody else. He said it was convenient not to 
hear.

03:52.663 --> 03:54.346
But was a wonderful lip reader. I've been in his 
office, and his secretary and I would be talking.

04:02.626 --> 04:08.552
Dr. Francis would come down and sit across here, 
and he'd look from one to the other. And we could

04:09.073 --> 04:16.060
know that he was lip reading, so every time I'd 
answer her, I'd turn to him. And he'd join in

04:17.802 --> 04:19.744
conversation.

04:22.167 --> 04:29.595
And he couldn't hear a word we were saying, but he 
went right through it.

04:35.026 --> 04:39.772
He did things his own way. For example, at 
commencement,

04:39.812 --> 05:00.780
every dean would get up and announce formally, of 
course, by the power invested in me and so forth and

04:39.812 --> 05:00.780
so forth, I present to you, the president, to the 
following students and either civil engineering

05:01.520 --> 05:07.346
or mechanical engineering or economics or 
whatnot, agriculture.

05:09.929 --> 05:15.575
And I remember Alan Ward finished, I think, the 
only man in 28.

05:18.479 --> 05:22.924
And we had commencement in Guyon Hall. And oh, it 
was hot by that time in May, latter part of May. No

05:30.592 --> 05:31.493
air conditioning.

05:34.274 --> 05:49.110
And when his time, Dean Kyle, of course, would get 
up in agriculture in his slow voice and take that

05:34.274 --> 05:49.110
year to go through every word of that formality. By 
the time veterinary medicine, that was the last

05:50.711 --> 05:54.315
one. And he said, Ward, stand up. Come get it. That 
was all. He didn't say by the power invested in me

06:04.564 --> 06:07.769
and all that, he said. And Ward would make that long 
walk down there, and of course by that time

06:09.972 --> 06:16.961
everybody would applaud him, but everybody would 
laugh. They were awake by that time. They always

06:18.703 --> 06:21.707
stayed to hear Dr. Francis. And when Ty Hardy, 
later he's retired from the Experiment Station at

06:22.448 --> 06:32.682
Sonora, same thing, says, Hardy, stand up, come 
and get it. and that was his way of ending the

06:33.809 --> 06:36.632
commencement. But he got by with things like that. 
It

06:43.520 --> 06:58.737
was probably the best thing in the world he could 
have done, but gave them a humorous

06:43.520 --> 06:58.737
view part of it. What kind of relations did he as a 
teacher have with his students? Oh, excellent. He

07:06.803 --> 07:11.370
was a very compassionate man. He knew the quality 
of the students. He didn't need to give final

07:17.178 --> 07:20.062
examinations. How he evaluated students' 
performances, I do not know. I never learned that.

07:26.912 --> 07:28.735
I studied him and studied him. I helped him out with 
some of his classes. I never knew how he could

07:31.758 --> 07:34.882
evaluate a student. But when he came to the final 
grades, they were right down the line. He didn't

07:42.492 --> 07:43.714
give them an exam? He just gave a grade? Oh, yes. 
He'd give us—

07:45.997 --> 07:55.930
How would he quiz you on that?

07:55.950 --> 08:01.157
Not orally, of course, because he couldn't hear, 
but he'd give us occasionally bring a pad of Form B

08:01.441 --> 08:05.147
in there. He said, OK, we're going to have an exam 
today. In general discussion, describe all the

08:09.052 --> 08:13.479
structures in here or there. And you had to know 
something about it. You mean snap quizzes he'd

08:17.104 --> 08:21.050
give you? Or would he tell you in advance? Oh, he 
would tell us. No, I don't think he ever gave us a pop

08:25.457 --> 08:27.720
quiz. He may have, but I don't recall. But

08:31.141 --> 08:43.395
in the class of 36, there were two students who had 
grades that mid-semester had grades reversed, I

08:31.141 --> 08:43.395
think. How, I don't know. It was probably an error, 
either in the registrar's office or either the

08:45.117 --> 08:52.045
secretary may have transposed them.

08:54.948 --> 08:59.173
But one was Charles Steger from Dallas, who was an A 
student in everything. And we had some excellent

09:00.807 --> 09:05.033
students in that class. I think there was 16 
students in that class and about, I'd say 12 or 14

09:06.435 --> 09:16.107
were straight A students. Oh, they were good 
students. And

09:19.993 --> 09:26.241
so one of the Boris came to me. He was later an 
instructor in medicine surgery. He was a boy from

09:32.113 --> 09:33.355
California.

09:35.798 --> 09:41.767
He said, would you ask Dr. Francis if he hasn't made 
an error in Charles Stegers? He was a buddy of

09:41.847 --> 09:43.649
Charles. They worked in the lab together. And with 
so-and-so and called this other boy's name from

09:46.774 --> 09:50.939
Puerto Rico. I said, oh, no. I said, I'm not going to 
bother him about grades. I said, those are not a

09:56.505 --> 10:00.811
part of your final grades. I said, the error will 
be, if it's an error, it'll be corrected. As a

10:06.920 --> 10:10.304
matter of curiosity, the following week, I just 
wrote him a note. I said, what kind of work is

10:11.626 --> 10:14.110
Charles Digger? He said, oh, he's a top student. I 
said, that boy's an A student, isn't he? And they

10:21.000 --> 10:22.722
had a C posted for him. And I said, what do you think 
about this man? I was thinking about this Puerto

10:27.412 --> 10:29.714
Rican. He said, oh, he comes in late every time. 
He's the first one to leave. And while he's there,

10:35.641 --> 10:37.583
he doesn't do a damn thing. He had them already. He 
knew them. And he had an A posted. Probably the only

10:45.191 --> 10:51.578
A he ever had while he was in school.

10:52.958 --> 11:01.470
by the end of the semester, why he had the grades, as 
I should have been. But I wasn't going to bother

11:01.490 --> 11:04.134
him. It wasn't my part to straighten things out.

11:11.404 --> 11:21.919
But that was one little thing, things like that 
that

11:11.404 --> 11:21.919
I enjoyed being with him. He had a knack of 
teaching. Do you think he enjoyed teaching? Oh,

11:26.069 --> 11:27.390
yes, very much so. And he had a sharp wit.

11:36.820 --> 11:50.995
In fact,

11:36.820 --> 11:50.995
I remember two men who, oh, in the last few years 
said, do you ever watch, that was when Arthur

11:36.820 --> 11:50.995
Fiedler was at his top, that was about six or eight 
years ago, If I ever watched the Boston Pops

11:52.325 --> 11:56.869
Orchestra, I said, yes. He says, who does Arthur 
Fiedler remind you of? I said, Dr. Francis. He

12:02.735 --> 12:04.356
said, yes, that's exactly. His hair, his white 
hair, the way he walked, sharp steps. Of course,

12:11.543 --> 12:15.186
Fiedler in his last year, he was shuffling a little 
bit more. And

12:16.948 --> 12:21.572
his mannerisms. or right down the line in his 
general appearance. He looked very much that

12:24.871 --> 12:30.318
mustache, appearance very similar to Dr. 
Francis. But, well,

12:32.381 --> 12:38.508
he was a great man. I

12:38.528 --> 12:44.035
remember, pardon me. He was,

12:50.341 --> 12:52.324
had a great interest in paleontology. In fact, he 
had a pretty good museum down here at one time. And

12:55.249 --> 13:10.695
collected bones, people would send specimens in 
for him or tell him about the gravel pit up around

12:55.249 --> 13:10.695
Waco or down around close to Sealy or down close to 
Houston. And he'd go and dig them up. And he had some

13:14.733 --> 13:19.399
big dinosaur bones and stuff like that, and teeth. 
And we'd go down after every, when the Brazos River

13:19.679 --> 13:30.892
would get out of bounds or have a flood, after every 
flood, we'd go down. And I went with him on a number

13:30.932 --> 13:33.134
of trips. He'd always go in his collection. and put 
about, oh, a half a dozen, depending on how many

13:39.262 --> 13:43.826
would go with us. I'd use my car, and

13:44.627 --> 13:54.617
we'd carry several, and he'd put these in his 
pocket. When he'd get down there, he'd walk ahead.

13:58.741 --> 14:00.723
We'd be busy with something. He'd give us 
something to look at. He'd go down and scatter

14:02.644 --> 14:07.429
these horse teeth.

14:08.438 --> 14:13.944
from his collection of prehistoric horse.

14:15.566 --> 14:22.953
So he come back and everybody found something. 
Well, you do pull mischief like that. So

14:25.856 --> 14:34.986
I went one weekend from Friday until Sunday. We 
spent in Houston. Somebody had written him a

14:36.819 --> 14:46.130
letter about a specimen

14:36.819 --> 14:46.130
down in the bio somewhere that they had found. But 
he wanted to go down there and look at it. And I took

14:51.135 --> 15:02.948
him down there in my car, and we stayed at the old 
McAtee Hotel right across from the Grand Central

14:51.135 --> 15:02.948
Station Railroad, both gone now.

15:06.185 --> 15:16.456
But after we checked in, we went up to an

15:06.185 --> 15:16.456
8th

15:06.185 --> 15:16.456
Friday evening. We ate at the Sanger Center Hotel 
there on Main Street, the corner of Main and I don't

15:18.979 --> 15:28.489
know whether that's Dallas or Walker. It's right 
across. The Sanger Center now is the Marr Hotel.

15:34.375 --> 15:35.837
The Marr extends from from Maine to, or the street 
to west of that, I've forgotten what the name of it

15:36.982 --> 15:44.108
is. But right across the street from Foley's, 
right north of Foley's, that's the Lamar Hotel.

15:48.973 --> 16:01.044
Well, right on the corner of Maine, standing back 
about half the block, was the San Jacinto Hotel,

15:48.973 --> 16:01.044
and that was a favorite meeting place for people 
who'd go down and shop from around this community.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.908
And so we ate supper there, and so He didn't hear 
what I was ordering. He was a ham and egger. And he

16:13.305 --> 16:14.085
came. He had ham and eggs. And I had a stuffed crab. 
And he looked over there at mine. And he says,

16:19.472 --> 16:20.153
Burns? He said, I want to get home.

16:25.879 --> 16:28.863
And he says, I hope you don't get sick on that. He 
said, we're planning to stay till Sunday.

16:35.015 --> 16:41.022
You know, people leave home, they start eating 
things that they're not accustomed to eating. And

16:43.204 --> 16:44.526
he says, it's wrong. They ought to eat pretty much 
safe things that they eat at home. And he says,

16:50.793 --> 16:55.539
there you are eating, of all things, a shellfish, a 
stuffed crab. And he says, this is Friday night. He

16:59.043 --> 17:04.549
says, you know what they've been doing here at the 
Santa Center since Monday morning? They've been

17:05.187 --> 17:13.398
saving table scraps to stuff that crab

17:05.187 --> 17:13.398
you're eating. Well, for breakfast, of course, I 
ordered bacon and eggs, ham and eggs. And then for

17:19.446 --> 17:21.950
lunch, I ate ham and eggs the rest of the time. And he 
says, you know, you're getting smart.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.081
But we went to... The old Metropolitan Theater, it 
was brand new then, and it was one of the first

17:31.664 --> 17:39.836
theaters that had that organ, you know, that was 
hydraulic. And so

17:41.118 --> 17:48.670
the picture show was, back in those days, B.B. 
Daniels was the reigning, probably the female

17:48.690 --> 17:55.360
actress at that time, the top one. But she was in a 
polo, playing polo, and it was in South America,

17:57.550 --> 18:16.798
I've forgotten the picture, and she was riding 
this polo pony, and her left leg slipped through

17:57.550 --> 18:16.798
the stove, and then she was hanging on to the horn, 
to the saddle. And Dr. Francis got up out of there,

18:16.818 --> 18:26.933
see, and he, and everybody around there got to 
yelling at him, laughing at him, see, a peculiar

18:16.818 --> 18:26.933
little fellow. And he rode every step until she was 
safe. Somebody stopped that horse. Well, right in

18:35.016 --> 18:41.447
the middle of the picture show, we were sitting 
downstairs, about a third from the front and the

18:35.016 --> 18:41.447
center. Very prominent. Every way you could see 
were people up in the balconies and back hours. And

18:49.199 --> 18:50.121
the lights went out. And...

18:55.988 --> 19:03.416
Immediately, Dr. Francis reached in his coat 
pocket and struck a match and lit this candle. And

19:05.578 --> 19:11.024
that was after this trick of this photo match. And 
the people got to laughing at him. He says, Burns,

19:13.987 --> 19:19.213
people panic in the complete darkness. And it was 
completely dark. He says, people panic. And he

19:23.866 --> 19:27.812
said, all they need to see is a little ray of light. 
And

19:28.534 --> 19:34.343
all of us were laughing at him. It was a show. And 
then we got home. He says, you know, I'll tell you

19:37.548 --> 19:44.179
something about that candle. He said, I was out in 
West Texas. He used to travel. When he came here in

19:47.605 --> 19:49.047
88, Of course, he had very little teaching, taught 
agriculture to students, but he did a lot of

19:50.005 --> 20:02.360
research and did a lot of extension work and 
traveled all over the state. And he was out in West

20:02.380 --> 20:09.049
Texas, and he said, that was the day before they'd 
have a toilet in each room. And he says, the toilet

20:10.330 --> 20:13.795
would be down by one on each floor. And he said, way 
down at the end of the hall. And he says, during the

20:17.461 --> 20:26.294
night I got up as usual and said, I walked down there 
and said, I thought I counted rooms going down

20:17.461 --> 20:26.294
there so I could get my way back. They were dark. And 
he says, I counted rooms and I stopped a little bit

20:30.380 --> 20:37.250
too soon and I opened the door and a woman screamed. 
And he says, ever since then I've carried a candle

20:37.270 --> 20:39.994
with me. He says, I'll never leave home without a 
candle.

20:47.262 --> 20:49.586
He had a lot of fun about him.

20:53.053 --> 20:54.476
Do you think he liked being the dean? Well, from the 
time I knew him, he really didn't. Dr. Marsteller

21:00.027 --> 21:07.060
took care of the dean's duties as far as 
registration and stuff like that.

21:09.284 --> 21:16.091
He was in demand as a lecturer, but he had stopped 
that by the time I got started taking veterinary

21:09.284 --> 21:16.091
medicine. That was back in the 16 when he went up 
there to lecture. I guess he got tired of it or

21:20.396 --> 21:22.058
something. He couldn't hear. But he had stopped 
it. But he would

21:29.246 --> 21:33.451
like to go to . He never did drive a car. Why not? They 
were on the Buick. Mrs. Francis drove them all, any

21:37.664 --> 21:42.007
place he wanted to go. But he would never miss a 
Shirley Temple show. Really? Yeah, he'd go to

21:48.413 --> 21:52.577
picture shows with her. But another

21:52.597 --> 22:05.768
thing I remember about him, he picked up the 
newspaper one day, and I think he was taking Dallas

21:52.597 --> 22:05.768
News, and he said, look there. on the sports page. 
He says,

22:08.938 --> 22:16.348
the Yanks slaughtered the Indians.

22:18.932 --> 22:27.103
He said, now what would a foreign student over here 
from the East, and we still had foreign students,

22:18.932 --> 22:27.103
not as many as we have now. But you did have some, 
huh? Oh, yes. And he says, what would a foreign

22:29.707 --> 22:32.331
student think about? Mainly South America or 
Mexico. What would a foreign student How could he

22:39.481 --> 22:42.284
read those lines on the page? Headlines, you know, 
are the Tigers,

22:42.564 --> 22:55.697
Tigers slaughter the Indians, or something like 
that, you know, devour the Indians. Typical sport

22:55.717 --> 23:01.843
page, and captioned, and headlines. He says, I 
don't know how they read those things. He said, He

23:08.067 --> 23:10.171
had the same trouble when he went to Germany. He 
stayed in Germany for a while, Berlin, and he said

23:10.231 --> 23:20.210
he had some of that trouble. What kind? I mean, how 
did he get along with the Germans? Well, I don't

23:23.236 --> 23:29.228
know, but as far as trying to read newspapers and 
things like that, no. He went over on the He

23:32.772 --> 23:38.439
inducted Conaway, who was later dean of the 
veterinary school at Missouri. But see, he had

23:39.540 --> 23:47.870
sent some cattle, a load of cattle up there to 
Missouri to work on this tick fever problem. And,

23:48.891 --> 23:55.098
oh, that was probably in the 90s, about that time. I 
know the same, the dipping vat. Sure. First

23:58.362 --> 23:59.944
dipping vat that... It was built in this part of the 
country. I think he built it in 96. He copied it from

24:04.707 --> 24:06.269
the King Ranch. I don't know what the King Ranch was 
doing with theirs. They were using it for a

24:09.532 --> 24:11.134
different purpose. But later, of course, they got 
in forced dipping over the state for these cattle.

24:19.103 --> 24:22.727
But it was all more or less from scratch research 
work then.

24:26.411 --> 24:28.513
So he and Dr. Conaway went to Europe. see if they 
could pick up anything. But the life history, the

24:33.570 --> 24:44.527
life cycle was done right here at the Experiment 
Station by Cooper Curtis, who was in the

24:33.570 --> 24:44.527
Veterinary Science Department under Dr. 
Francis. So

24:46.430 --> 24:56.205
unless it was to study the organism, but he and Dr. 
Conway visit the University of Berlin. I think

24:59.402 --> 25:03.266
they were in Austria, but mainly the University of 
Berlin. What do you think Dr. Francis' aim for the

25:03.867 --> 25:08.253
vet school was, his goal?

25:11.277 --> 25:11.897
I don't know. When he,

25:11.917 --> 25:19.587
he had a pretty hard time. The first he started off 
with a 14 by 16 room in the old main building which

25:24.451 --> 25:30.199
was destroyed by fire in 1912.

25:32.322 --> 25:37.629
And that was his office, classroom, and 
laboratory, 14 by 16. And it was on the first floor

25:37.850 --> 25:47.623
of the old, well that main building was right where 
the academic building, the one with the dome on it.

25:49.105 --> 25:50.307
And 14 by 16, and the following year they gave him 
another room.

25:57.719 --> 26:08.132
And for a laboratory, they built him a frame 
building down pretty close to where the ag

25:57.719 --> 26:08.132
building is now, the old ag building.

26:10.856 --> 26:17.244
I think 18 by 30 feet, and that's where he had lab.

26:19.907 --> 26:21.289
And, but... Shortly after that, they were doing 
dissecting work

26:23.581 --> 26:34.738
in the old natatorium, which they used to have a 
bathhouse. The students, instead of having

26:34.858 --> 26:42.108
bathing facilities and a dormitory, they used 
that as a bathhouse down there. It was between what

26:42.129 --> 26:47.216
is now Francis Hall, where the business is. I don't 
know.

26:51.982 --> 26:54.425
Between that and the chemistry building. Facing, 
well, it would be right on that street, right

26:55.586 --> 27:05.718
west of the chemistry building and Francis Hall. 
And between that and the Harrington building over

27:06.919 --> 27:12.746
there. Of course, that is a dead end now. It's a 
library.

27:24.297 --> 27:27.341
But did he ever talk to you about his aim or his goal? 
Well, he mentioned back in 33 when they were

27:28.482 --> 27:45.061
tearing down the old veterinary hospital right 
across the street from the lag building and that

27:28.482 --> 27:45.061
later was where the engineering building was 
built. He just mentioned that day that

27:55.820 --> 28:23.852
about he says it's on the go now and he says

27:55.820 --> 28:23.852
there should be some marked improvements when if 
and when somebody

27:55.820 --> 28:23.852
can produce

28:26.920 --> 28:48.479
I don't recall his exact words, but

28:26.920 --> 28:48.479
when they can do something to justify the increase 
in growth. But

28:48.499 --> 28:55.965
oh my, I don't know whether you could visualize 
what it's grown into though. I don't think anybody

28:56.705 --> 28:58.166
could do that.

29:03.011 --> 29:10.738
Because in the 60s, when things really took off,

29:03.011 --> 29:10.738
that's where the greatest growth has occurred. 
But that's beyond, I think, anybody's

29:13.161 --> 29:17.064
expectations. And then this new building is, oh, I 
don't know. It started off with, I think, about a $9

29:22.069 --> 29:25.092
million appropriation for this new clinic 
building, which is supposed to be operated

29:26.472 --> 29:40.532
by

29:26.472 --> 29:40.532
May or June 81, I believe. They started, broke 
ground on it. What's going up very quickly now?

29:45.299 --> 29:56.395
Last year, I think in,

29:45.299 --> 29:56.395
yeah, broke ground in September 79.

29:58.501 --> 30:00.103
So it's going to take two years. Why did you say that 
he was the greatest, about the greatest man that

30:00.623 --> 30:05.429
you've ever known? Well, of his accomplishments 
and his compassion and

30:07.752 --> 30:28.255
his ability, his keenness, able to do research 
work and teaching and just general viewpoints on

30:07.752 --> 30:28.255
life. And

30:30.023 --> 30:39.878
he never called a roll, and I doubt if any student 
ever cut his classes.

30:47.290 --> 30:58.107
But he had a wonderful way, uncanny way, of 
evaluating people.
