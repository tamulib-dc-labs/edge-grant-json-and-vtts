WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:05.003
Anyway, I kicked him out in Brady.

00:08.108 --> 00:08.890
But he came back.

00:09.511 --> 00:15.521
We got back from tour, and he came to the office and apologized to me, blah, blah, blah.

00:16.262 --> 00:17.884
And he apologized to the officers.

00:17.905 --> 00:20.369
He apologized to the group.

00:20.389 --> 00:21.390
And they laid him back in.

00:23.454 --> 00:27.220
But in those days, well, and I guess even now,

00:27.908 --> 00:39.162
The guys are the ones who discipline or vote to eliminate or extricate other members.

00:40.524 --> 00:43.768
As I said, the only time I interfered was on a morals basis.

00:44.309 --> 00:46.612
What about student leadership?

00:46.672 --> 00:57.325
Was there a president or a... Yes, always a president, vice president, business manager, tour manager, publicity manager,

00:57.507 --> 00:59.389
And now I understand they have a chaplain.

01:01.310 --> 01:05.274
But we always have had a prayer before any concert backstage.

01:09.078 --> 01:11.960
You said Fred was the first black member.

01:12.981 --> 01:15.744
There must have been Hispanic members down through the years.

01:16.184 --> 01:18.726
Oh yeah.

01:18.746 --> 01:23.591
And I presume there was diversity in terms of religious preference.

01:24.672 --> 01:26.974
Were there some international students also?

01:27.663 --> 01:28.845
Yes, yes.

01:29.205 --> 01:44.146
One of the things we did, the first day the MUFOs reported for rehearsal, we'd have them stand, give their name, hometown, their major, and tell us if they had any eligible sisters.

01:45.548 --> 01:46.429
That was the routine.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.593
Of course, it was great fun.

01:50.294 --> 01:55.982
But we always did that, and many times we'd ask them what high school they went to.

01:57.042 --> 02:10.655
No, we've had Asians, Puerto Ricans, Mexican.

02:16.861 --> 02:19.284
We haven't had any Japanese.

02:19.344 --> 02:22.527
We had Chinese.

02:24.667 --> 02:32.258
And we did have two other black students after Fred.

02:33.019 --> 02:43.755
One of them went on to become a big wheeler with the student government, and he had to drop out of the group because he was so busy doing that.

02:44.950 --> 02:49.276
We really didn't have many black students audition.

02:50.557 --> 02:54.142
We had American Indian, Native American.

02:54.162 --> 02:59.790
And I presume you had a few, if any, problems, diversity problems.

03:01.051 --> 03:01.792
None.

03:04.616 --> 03:09.102
Describe, if you will, women becoming part of singing cadets.

03:09.706 --> 03:10.107
Never.

03:11.550 --> 03:11.790
No.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.293
I thought there were women now.

03:13.313 --> 03:13.634
No.

03:13.934 --> 03:14.756
In the same cadets?

03:14.816 --> 03:15.457
No, no, no.

03:15.838 --> 03:25.437
We have, we organized a group, simply because we were having so many

03:27.155 --> 03:33.542
girls in the auditioning for, we started the women's chorus with Patty Fletus.

03:33.642 --> 03:35.624
She was a new graduate of TU.

03:36.886 --> 03:37.206
Okay.

03:37.266 --> 03:39.969
Now, was this part of your... Yeah.

03:39.989 --> 03:42.972
Oh, describe that then, the women's chorus beginning.

03:42.992 --> 03:49.700
We were having more and more girls come to A&M, and they didn't really have anything to do.

03:49.820 --> 03:50.901
I mean, they didn't have any

03:51.421 --> 03:57.055
Activities, they didn't have any musical outlets at all.

03:57.456 --> 03:59.000
So we started the women's chorus.

03:59.682 --> 04:07.742
And Patty Fletus, who had the summer before been doing her master's thesis and came to A&M,

04:08.077 --> 04:09.279
She lived here in Bryan.

04:09.939 --> 04:16.067
And she had to do a choral piece for mixed music, mixed chorus.

04:16.929 --> 04:22.336
And so we recruited some girls here in town and some girls who were students.

04:23.637 --> 04:25.440
And some of our guys.

04:25.620 --> 04:30.206
And we performed this for her for her master's program.

04:31.187 --> 04:38.016
Well, she graduated then and came back to town without a job or anything.

04:38.367 --> 04:42.133
So we hired her as the director of the women's chorus.

04:43.114 --> 04:54.771
Well, we got to the point where we were having so many great auditions for the women's chorus that we were turning away too many.

04:55.532 --> 05:02.442
So we started what was called the New Tradition Singers, because it was a quote, new tradition.

05:03.123 --> 05:05.567
And we had guys.

05:06.388 --> 05:07.750
Do you know when that was?

05:10.008 --> 05:15.533
Yeah, it was after, it was somewhere around 75.

05:16.354 --> 05:19.196
Okay.

05:19.316 --> 05:23.680
Williams leaves the presidency in 76.

05:24.101 --> 05:25.742
He has the heart attacks in 76.

05:25.922 --> 05:26.143
Right.

05:26.583 --> 05:29.305
And that, in fact, was a barometer.

05:30.406 --> 05:32.448
Okay, this was before he left.

05:32.648 --> 05:34.090
Okay.

05:34.390 --> 05:37.753
Probably 75.

05:38.797 --> 05:47.153
Anyway, so therefore we had another opportunity for girls to get into something.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.331
It was 76th of the Centennial?

05:52.213 --> 05:53.395
Okay.

05:53.415 --> 05:56.179
We were the New Tradition Singers for two years.

05:57.422 --> 05:58.664
And then the Centennial came.

05:59.825 --> 06:09.682
And because the New Tradition Singers sounded kind of like a folk group, kind of terminology, we changed it to the Century Singers that year.

06:11.284 --> 06:13.468
The year of the Centennial.

06:13.488 --> 06:15.351
And it still is, the Century Singers.

06:15.685 --> 06:19.490
All right, and so Singing Cadets continued to the present.

06:19.510 --> 06:19.730
Right.

06:20.391 --> 06:22.134
And the... It's the oldest of the vocalists.

06:22.154 --> 06:26.099
Right, and the Century Singers, and then the Women's Chorus.

06:27.681 --> 06:27.921
Right.

06:28.302 --> 06:29.163
So all three.

06:30.465 --> 06:32.748
Did you, in the years... And the Reveliers.

06:33.228 --> 06:34.070
Oh, in the Reveliers.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.171
The vocal jazz group.

06:35.311 --> 06:42.621
Did you encounter, after those became, those organizations became realities,

06:43.107 --> 06:49.836
Did you have any women coming over, crusading to become members of the scene cadets?

06:49.856 --> 06:51.979
Oh, that was always a standing joke.

06:52.240 --> 06:59.349
I mean, I'd have girls walk into my office very seriously, you know, say, Mr. Boone, I'd like to audition for the scene cadets.

06:59.930 --> 07:04.176
And I would very seriously say, well, when you get back from surgery, come see me.

07:05.197 --> 07:07.701
And they'd just laugh and walk out.

07:07.741 --> 07:09.644
Oh, so they would take it as a smile?

07:09.904 --> 07:10.425
Oh, sure.

07:10.505 --> 07:11.806
It was a joke to begin with.

07:11.847 --> 07:12.928
They knew it, you know.

07:12.908 --> 07:14.472
Okay.

07:14.492 --> 07:17.762
But it was a very serious conversation, you know.

07:18.303 --> 07:18.845
It was fun.

07:19.206 --> 07:25.864
But you're inferring that no one came serious serious and threatened a lawsuit or anything?

07:25.884 --> 07:26.667
Never had.

07:26.687 --> 07:26.907
Okay.

07:26.927 --> 07:27.930
Not in my time.

07:27.910 --> 07:32.739
All right, and no administrator made an issue.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.142
Not to my knowledge.

07:34.162 --> 07:34.402
Okay.

07:34.423 --> 07:35.224
I wasn't aware of any.

07:37.508 --> 07:50.273
Let's see, chronologically, Dr. Williams is here from late 70 to 76, and that's when the enrollment then really begins to grow because of women.

07:51.130 --> 08:01.161
Do the demands, you and your time and your efforts, do those, does that workload increase also during that period?

08:01.801 --> 08:02.242
Oh, sure.

08:03.804 --> 08:17.138
Well, one thing about the cadets, for instance, we tried to keep the round number of membership at 60 because mainly for travel purposes.

08:17.607 --> 08:22.034
People suggested, you know, well, you ought to have 85, 90 in the group.

08:23.055 --> 08:26.781
And then just take a select group when you go on tour.

08:27.242 --> 08:28.043
I didn't want to do that.

08:28.403 --> 08:30.967
That destroyed inside, internally.

08:31.828 --> 08:32.770
So I said no.

08:32.950 --> 08:37.978
And so that's, we were highly restrictive as to how many we could take.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.682
But I still took guys who couldn't sing.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.446
I still took guys who said, yeah.

08:43.426 --> 08:48.552
They had that enthusiasm and they were Aggies, you could tell right away.

08:50.054 --> 08:51.836
Yeah, we had to have those guys.

08:53.238 --> 08:54.520
But we had good singers too.

08:54.680 --> 08:58.264
And we had more and more All-State type people.

08:59.926 --> 09:03.831
Then the Century Singers, Jess Wade came.

09:05.465 --> 09:10.558
They started really expanding, you know, and he's done such a marvelous job.

09:10.879 --> 09:14.087
Now, the Century Singers has a larger repertoire?

09:15.130 --> 09:20.183
Basically, in the main, a classical repertoire.

09:21.108 --> 09:30.802
They'll do some show tunes and maybe a spiritual or two every now and then, but basically they're a classical choir and just does that beautifully.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.226
He also directs now the women's chorus.

09:34.147 --> 09:38.894
And the Sing Cadets have remained pretty well A&M tradition.

09:40.316 --> 09:43.781
Yes, sir.

09:44.102 --> 09:45.043
Since J.J.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.166
started them,

09:49.880 --> 10:06.062
Back in the 40s, actually 39 I think, it's become, well it's fluctuated based on the director.

10:07.384 --> 10:16.697
There was a time when they did practically nothing more than sacred music, before JJ's, Wilkitt's tenure.

10:17.656 --> 10:27.931
And then right after JJ's tenure, because the director at that time was the son of a preacher out of Houston.

10:31.917 --> 10:38.466
Then Bill Turner came of course and they started doing more show tunes and spirituals, more variety.

10:39.458 --> 10:48.033
And then I came and tried to incorporate God, country, brotherhood, and fun.

10:49.396 --> 10:56.168
And I told the guys, if it ain't fun, don't do it.

10:58.983 --> 11:02.448
It's been pretty standard ever since.

11:03.269 --> 11:14.266
Probably more standard with Bill Turner and I, and more traditional than with prior to that.

11:14.286 --> 11:22.999
I found out that there used to be a mixed chorus back before

11:22.979 --> 11:29.508
When the student body, the corps used to go to chapel every day, there was a choir there, a mixed chorus.

11:30.189 --> 11:36.338
And it was made up of faculty wives and daughters and students.

11:36.358 --> 11:38.100
But they sang at chapel every day.

11:39.362 --> 11:43.848
Let's see, John Coldest comes in the early 70s.

11:43.868 --> 11:44.108
Right.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.473
And so you all reported then to him.

11:47.914 --> 11:48.034
Right.

11:48.054 --> 11:50.978
Were there any changes that... Very supportive.

11:51.818 --> 11:57.660
Again, money reared its evil head.

11:58.644 --> 12:03.060
We've always felt like we were kind of bastard children.

12:04.475 --> 12:10.263
that no one really, really cared about.

12:10.283 --> 12:12.627
I mean, they'd give word service to it.

12:12.947 --> 12:19.036
But it was much more important, and at a university, logically.

12:20.658 --> 12:25.385
The academic program, etcetera, was number one.

12:25.505 --> 12:26.406
Well, sure.

12:27.428 --> 12:30.432
But like I say, when I came here,

12:31.036 --> 12:35.385
In 60, I was making $6,600 a year.

12:37.350 --> 12:50.378
In 1980, I was making less than $35,000 a year.

12:51.539 --> 12:58.253
And I was putting in a lot of hours, a lot of time, and growing, and doing good things.

12:58.934 --> 13:01.159
I loved it.

13:01.279 --> 13:02.582
I loved everything I was doing.

13:03.283 --> 13:08.434
But I felt like I was, again, kind of a bastard child.

13:09.393 --> 13:12.197
And other people were getting a lot of recognition.

13:12.217 --> 13:14.900
But it was all based on academics, and I knew that.

13:16.282 --> 13:17.524
But I couldn't do anything about it.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.253
So Coldus brought no changes.

13:26.195 --> 13:28.799
Well, yeah, he got us a little more support.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.281
Okay.

13:30.301 --> 13:34.126
And he worked at it.

13:34.426 --> 13:35.147
He had to.

13:36.292 --> 13:40.638
I could never understand John, how he did all he did.

13:41.700 --> 13:42.621
He's a super guy.

13:44.985 --> 13:45.926
Boundless energy.

13:46.407 --> 13:50.933
Always positive in his outlook.

13:52.856 --> 13:53.357
Go man.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.460
Do your thing.

13:58.204 --> 14:01.168
A great encouragement for us.

14:01.148 --> 14:04.472
And monetarily helpful.

14:06.214 --> 14:25.958
After looking at the administrative changes, in terms of presidents, Jarvis Miller, Chuck Sampson, Vandiver, and so forth, any of those presidents have any special relation to plus or minus with the... Vandiver was least interested in the singularity of any president we had.

14:28.165 --> 14:29.708
He just didn't care.

14:31.390 --> 14:33.053
He was a historian and that was it.

14:35.077 --> 14:40.285
Jarvis Miller was very supportive but in a very bad spot.

14:42.750 --> 14:45.955
And we knew that.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.472
Let's see, Mobley.

14:51.316 --> 14:52.378
Mobley was good.

14:52.738 --> 14:59.989
Again, we had the connection there, at least I did, through the Methodist Church deal.

15:00.670 --> 15:04.396
And he was very supportive.

15:04.977 --> 15:14.912
Again, he was getting orders from people above him to hold back or something.

15:15.820 --> 15:19.147
He robbed Peter to pay Paul every now and then to help us.

15:20.069 --> 15:27.966
Do you have any idea what the, in terms of the accounting, what was the source of funding?

15:28.206 --> 15:30.772
Was it student fee account?

15:31.052 --> 15:35.061
Partially student fee.

15:36.087 --> 15:46.199
Student activity, money, Association of Former Students, the concessions account.

15:46.599 --> 15:48.021
Okay.

15:48.041 --> 15:52.766
We got it from a lot of different places, a lot of different pockets.

15:52.786 --> 15:57.792
Not a whole bunch from any of them, but enough to make up the total operating budget.

15:58.261 --> 16:12.179
Describe when everything was in high gear, describe a comparative academic years schedule beginning with the fall semester start.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.302
What did you and the cadets do?

16:16.083 --> 16:26.817
Oh, well, excuse me, the first thing we did was go through the audition program and the training program for the Bufos.

16:28.012 --> 16:42.377
starting to learn music immediately, doing banquet-type performance conferences, A&M conferences on campus or in the community, the Hilton or the Ramada or whatever.

16:43.519 --> 16:46.003
And we'd do...

16:45.983 --> 16:51.351
Oh, probably 17, 18 of those between then and the end of the semester.

16:52.152 --> 17:03.328
End of the semester, we'd be getting ready for the Christmas concert, which was usually, it always worked out the same day as the Bryan College Stage Christmas Parade.

17:05.171 --> 17:09.477
But it didn't really bother us that much, except that the guys who were in the parade,

17:09.457 --> 17:14.341
I had to come back real quick and change clothes and blah blah blah and do the Christmas concert that night.

17:14.902 --> 17:16.803
And that concert was usually where?

17:17.684 --> 17:18.125
In Rudder.

17:18.585 --> 17:32.297
It started in Guyne, but the really big one started in Rudder because we started including all three of the groups, all four of the groups actually.

17:32.317 --> 17:32.477
St.

17:32.497 --> 17:34.899
Cadets, Women's Chorus, Century Singers, and Reveilliers.

17:37.081 --> 17:38.923
And we'd each do a segment.

17:39.680 --> 17:43.564
And then the grand finale, which was always the Honolulu Chorus.

17:44.877 --> 18:02.559
And then from the date of that, say it was like December 4th or something, from there we would, the cadets would highly concentrate on tour music because they were getting ready to go home for their Christmas break.

18:04.401 --> 18:14.614
And I'd make what I called learning tapes for them that we would record in rehearsal, during rehearsal, so they could take it home with them and be working on it while they were home.

18:16.315 --> 18:29.673
The Century Singers and the Women's Chorus and the River Lairs, more or less after that Christmas concert, shut down until the second semester, until the next semester.

18:30.575 --> 18:36.783
Well then, of course, we went on our ten-day tour, and we'd go, and we went everywhere.

18:37.444 --> 18:40.348
We went into Louisiana.

18:41.543 --> 18:57.260
maybe four times during my tenure, maybe five, because we went to New Orleans twice, went to Baton Rouge, went to Shreveport, Bossier City, Lexington, Livingston, Lexington.

18:57.281 --> 18:58.722
That's where the Baptist College is.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.830
Went into Arkansas once.

19:07.801 --> 19:20.773
Never did get into Oklahoma, and never got into New Mexico, but we'd travel three, four thousand miles a year just within Texas.

19:21.655 --> 19:24.983
And normally, what was the duration of the trip?

19:25.908 --> 19:37.043
Well, we did the 10-day tour in January, and then in the spring semester, we'd do four, possibly five, weekend tours, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

19:37.123 --> 19:37.344
All right.

19:38.145 --> 19:41.049
How many concerts would you give in that 10-day?

19:42.651 --> 19:48.159
Oh, we'd do definitely 10, and sometimes as many as 12.

19:48.559 --> 19:52.725
If we had the opportunity to sing, like on Sundays,

19:53.060 --> 19:56.573
singing at church on Sunday morning, and then the concert that night.

19:57.476 --> 19:59.965
Or if we had the chance to sing in a public school.

20:00.940 --> 20:02.562
In an assembly we would.

20:03.344 --> 20:05.747
It was always tiring to have to do two in one day.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.930
Who did the scheduling?

20:08.491 --> 20:08.872
We did.

20:09.012 --> 20:09.292
I did.

20:09.453 --> 20:10.975
You decided where to go.

20:11.235 --> 20:11.476
Right.

20:11.936 --> 20:17.985
We'd get requests, you know, postcards, mail, phone calls.

20:18.386 --> 20:22.492
And we went every year to Dallas.

20:23.253 --> 20:24.715
Austin always ended our tour.

20:25.997 --> 20:28.821
San Antonio, Houston.

20:28.801 --> 20:40.356
Every now and then we'd hit Fort Worth, not every year though, but those were always stops, those cities I named.

20:41.498 --> 20:49.729
As you look back, what were your favorite places for a stop?

20:50.587 --> 20:56.767
Houston, well, it's just the people there, the ladies there.

20:56.787 --> 21:00.900
And most of the time we were sponsored by A&M Mothers Club.

21:01.268 --> 21:03.772
or an A&M club, or a combination thereof.

21:04.713 --> 21:21.377
But then many times we'd be sponsored by the civic arts committee or whatever, or a church, or a school, just a school, high school choir, or a band trying to raise money for a trip or something, you know.

21:22.559 --> 21:27.546
But most of the time we were affiliated with A&M others clubs and A&M clubs.

21:30.395 --> 21:33.725
All right, so San Antonio was always a good spot.

21:34.267 --> 21:39.342
I remember when we sang, the Aggie wore him on the steps of the

21:40.587 --> 21:43.191
on the UT campus.

21:44.172 --> 21:50.701
We'd gone over to participate in a male chorus contest.

21:50.721 --> 21:51.282
We won.

21:53.285 --> 22:02.157
But the morning after, we all lined up on the steps of that library and sang the Aggie War hymn, and we survived.

22:02.862 --> 22:05.044
It was pretty close.

22:05.805 --> 22:07.727
All right, so back to the schedule.

22:07.867 --> 22:12.352
Then the spring, you did the January, then some weekends.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.775
Right, and that varied usually from four.

22:16.096 --> 22:19.159
It averaged four to five, never more than five.

22:19.359 --> 22:21.501
All right, then muster and what other?

22:22.783 --> 22:25.746
Spring concert, our spring concert here.

22:26.487 --> 22:27.488
And that normally came?

22:27.548 --> 22:29.730
May.

22:30.925 --> 22:32.669
end of April, maybe.

22:33.391 --> 22:39.204
And then we used to, our spring concert was, quote, the end of the season.

22:40.828 --> 22:43.213
But the last, no, ten years,

22:44.729 --> 22:55.499
We'd always have three, four, maybe even five banquet-type or conference-type shows to do after our spring concert.

22:56.140 --> 22:59.603
And they were all always kind of anticlimactic.

23:00.124 --> 23:01.846
We had done our thing.

23:01.866 --> 23:02.807
We were tired.

23:03.747 --> 23:14.618
But sometimes you had to do some just to satisfy the need to possibly do it at another time the next year.

23:15.695 --> 23:26.129
Now there must be some good stories you recall of some goofs, some foul ups, some mistakes, and some marvelous accomplishments on these trips.

23:28.512 --> 23:38.686
Well, of course, outstanding in my mind were the seven years we went to Miss Teenage America for national television exposure.

23:40.628 --> 23:45.094
We first went, Charlie Meeker was in charge of that then,

23:45.074 --> 23:53.488
And he had heard us sing at Six Flags Over Texas on an Easter weekend.

23:54.390 --> 23:59.879
And we were on the amphitheater stage at that time singing and it started to rain.

24:00.861 --> 24:03.064
And we just stood there and sang anyway, you know.

24:04.106 --> 24:08.373
And then walked around the grounds trying to dry out.

24:08.754 --> 24:10.677
But he had heard us and seen us do that.

24:11.180 --> 24:14.610
And he's the one that initiated the invitation to Miss Teenage America.

24:15.874 --> 24:22.573
Anyway, the first year, let's say the first three or four years we went, we had a total of seven.

24:23.482 --> 24:26.827
They'd give us a definite spot in the show.

24:26.867 --> 24:29.791
We were gigolos, of course, escorts for the girls.

24:30.573 --> 24:37.062
But he'd give us a definite spot where we were in the spotlight and had a chance to do our thing.

24:37.363 --> 24:41.369
And everybody knew we were from Texas A&M.

24:42.711 --> 24:49.941
Well, as it went on further down, the spot kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller.

24:50.342 --> 24:52.425
And finally, after the seventh year, I said, Charlie,

24:52.861 --> 24:58.070
I'm sorry, we're not doing what we came here to do in the beginning.

24:58.110 --> 25:01.476
And he said, now don't burn your bridges behind you.

25:01.496 --> 25:03.740
And I said, you've already burned it, Charlie.

25:04.080 --> 25:04.821
We're out of here.

25:05.423 --> 25:06.184
So we didn't go back.

25:06.424 --> 25:08.528
But we used to do it on Thanksgiving weekend.

25:09.249 --> 25:17.463
The guys were playing football on Thanksgiving Day, but they'd set up monitors for us to watch the game during rehearsals and so forth.

25:17.663 --> 25:18.565
It was a good deal.

25:19.709 --> 25:24.260
We drank so much Dr. Pepper it would kill you as one of the sponsors.

25:26.505 --> 25:28.390
That was exciting.

25:28.410 --> 25:34.445
The trip to the Mike Douglas show in Philadelphia was great.

25:34.786 --> 25:37.853
That's when I popped my cummerbund on camera.

25:38.862 --> 25:51.328
Well, the thing is, Mrs. Conley, he used to have guest co-hosts, and one month he was having governor's wives.

25:52.069 --> 25:58.442
So Mrs. Conley was one of the hosts, and she's the one that got us up there.

25:58.522 --> 26:00.246
She said she wanted to sink it up there.

26:01.812 --> 26:04.060
And I don't know how we paid for that trip.

26:04.140 --> 26:07.372
I don't know if they paid for it or I don't know how we got there.

26:07.392 --> 26:12.008
But we went and spent three days

26:13.287 --> 26:26.346
We got to visit Valley Forge, and one of the most memorable things I can recall is when we sang the Battle Hymn of the Republic in the chapel there at Valley Forge.

26:27.207 --> 26:32.115
And all of us just, well we all ended up crying, and goosebumps.

26:32.135 --> 26:34.578
It's just amazing.

26:35.420 --> 26:38.664
But I popped my cover button on camera on his show.

26:39.445 --> 26:41.168
We were singing O Holy Night.

26:41.755 --> 26:46.121
And the deal was, he was supposed to sing the solo, and we were going to back him up.

26:46.902 --> 26:48.204
Well, that's the way we rehearsed it.

26:48.564 --> 26:53.792
But during rehearsals, I'd sing the solo, you know, in my baritone voice.

26:54.052 --> 26:54.633
He's a tenor.

26:56.015 --> 26:59.159
And we got up there, and we get on camera.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.163
And he said, oh, Bob, I don't feel like doing this.

27:02.183 --> 27:04.126
I said, why don't you sing it?

27:04.146 --> 27:05.668
Well, I was.

27:06.489 --> 27:07.170
So I did it.

27:07.971 --> 27:10.935
But when I reached for that high note at the very end,

27:11.607 --> 27:14.291
My cover button popped.

27:15.554 --> 27:22.625
So I had my hand here and I didn't let go of it until we got off camera and then it fell to the floor of course.

27:22.806 --> 27:24.889
I told him, I said, you should have done that.

27:25.851 --> 27:28.956
And then when we get back on camera he makes a big deal out of it.

27:29.617 --> 27:32.542
My cover button popped in.

27:33.543 --> 27:34.525
But that was a good trip.

27:35.146 --> 27:36.889
The Ed Selvin Show was a good trip.

27:37.645 --> 27:47.600
We got that as a result of working with Sergio Franke at one of the Miss Teenage America pageants.

27:49.763 --> 27:51.145
And we enjoyed that trip.

27:51.185 --> 27:59.097
We got kind of screwed out of, pardon the expression.

28:01.861 --> 28:04.063
Doing the second song, we had two songs ready.

28:04.083 --> 28:11.932
The one we did with him backing up No Man Who Was an Island, which he had heard us know at the Miss Teenage pageant.

28:11.952 --> 28:14.735
But then it had been a big, super, super arrangement.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.977
And he sang the solo, we backed him up.

28:17.778 --> 28:26.147
And then we were supposed to do Sunshine in My Soul as a solo piece for us.

28:26.819 --> 28:37.390
Well, the group that preceded us on his show, it was a variety show, of course, and the group that preceded us was a funky jazz group.

28:37.410 --> 28:40.533
They had incense on their guitars and everything else, you know.

28:41.214 --> 28:46.400
Well, they went over their time slot, and they had to cut our solo out.

28:47.541 --> 28:52.506
But we made a big joke of that all over the state of Texas when we got back.

28:53.937 --> 28:56.560
Sunshine in My Soul was the name of it.

28:56.580 --> 29:00.185
And in fact, we did an album that's called Sunshine, you know.

29:01.226 --> 29:01.646
It's fun.

29:04.630 --> 29:05.591
That was a great trip.

29:06.052 --> 29:13.280
We went to Chicago to the National Hospital Administrators' Convention.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.523
And that was a great trip.

29:15.583 --> 29:20.569
We stayed on the river on the lakefront in a sports club there.

29:21.747 --> 29:29.636
And we got to see the museums there along the lakefront.

29:29.657 --> 29:34.743
Of course, the trip to Romania was great.

29:34.843 --> 29:35.984
That was 21 days.

29:37.967 --> 29:41.911
And Romania, of course, is smaller than the state of Texas.

29:42.132 --> 29:43.333
When did you make that trip?

29:43.353 --> 29:44.094
Do you remember?

29:49.921 --> 29:51.703
I can tell you.

29:56.678 --> 30:12.915
so that trip to romania was 1990 and you said 21 days 21 days no one got sick no not really uh we've we've uh in all of our touring we've had very rarely uh

30:13.621 --> 30:15.003
real serious.

30:15.703 --> 30:21.851
I mean we'd get guys with the flu and things like that, but nothing earth-shaking.

30:22.712 --> 30:23.833
We'd deal with it.

30:25.415 --> 30:36.928
And many times we'd have, of course as I said, the guys always stayed in host homes, and the host would take care of them.

30:38.107 --> 30:39.949
threw up or did anything.

30:40.710 --> 30:44.193
They had a doctor there and blah, blah, blah in no time.

30:44.694 --> 30:46.355
They really took care of them.

30:46.375 --> 30:55.485
Now, do you remember any other than a cummerbund problem, do you remember any other mix-ups or goofs on trips?

31:00.270 --> 31:04.654
Probably not because I'd try to forget them as quick as possible.

31:05.765 --> 31:09.710
Did scene cadet members ever attempt to play any tricks on you?

31:10.031 --> 31:11.693
Oh, oh yeah.

31:11.713 --> 31:12.494
Share some of those.

31:12.894 --> 31:17.040
Well, we used to have what they called pull-outs.

31:18.982 --> 31:25.731
The bufos at the end of particularly our spring concert would

31:26.993 --> 31:38.554
Hold up signs, change words of songs to my chagrin.

31:39.175 --> 31:42.741
Usually, it started to get out of hand.

31:43.643 --> 31:51.617
And it finally got to the point where I said, okay, you could do three pull-outs, but you have to prove them.

31:51.985 --> 31:58.198
with me because if they interfere with the flow of the show or if they're too inside.
