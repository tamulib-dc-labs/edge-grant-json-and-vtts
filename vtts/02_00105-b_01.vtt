00:03.220 --> 00:09.068
I was mentioning I was very interested in the 
trivia of A&M, especially as it relates to sports.

00:09.188 --> 00:23.227
And I've done a number of speeches that, depending 
on how long you want, 15 to 30 minutes, even going

00:09.188 --> 00:23.227
with the traveling Aggies to Ireland last year, 
I'd have campusology questions because

00:09.188 --> 00:23.227
everybody can identify with them. But I might ask, 
what is A&M's greatest football game? When the

00:28.534 --> 00:31.438
course center, I have to give a lot of tours. And I'd 
get down to the end where one of the cases where we

00:31.773 --> 00:41.522
have one half of it, two of the panels devoted to 
General Rutter. On the other side, two to Dr.

00:42.163 --> 00:50.650
Sanders, who the Core Center is named after 
because he gave us the $1.5 million gift. But I

00:50.670 --> 01:01.240
would ask the question, if I happen to be in that 
part of the Core Center, or even at reunions or

00:50.670 --> 01:01.240
whatever, what was A&M's greatest football game? 
And it'll come around after a while. Someone will

01:05.337 --> 01:07.419
say the Center College game. And

01:07.539 --> 01:21.612
you ask the question about

01:07.539 --> 01:21.612
that game, you can say, well, why is that game so 
important? And you can go back and there's an

01:21.752 --> 01:29.599
entire epistle could be written about that game. 
The coach for Center College, He had been fired at

01:34.143 --> 01:42.955
A&M, had a tremendous winning record, had been 
fired, and here he is now coaching a center

01:34.143 --> 01:42.955
college, a little school up in Kentucky. and of 
course where the debates took place, the second

01:43.390 --> 01:52.500
one this year for the president race, he turned 
down the Rose Bowl. They had beaten Harvard the

01:52.620 --> 01:57.746
game before, but why did he want to come to Texas A&M 
and play? Was it revenge? When I say A&M, it was

02:00.228 --> 02:05.674
actually the start of the Cotton Bowl Classic 
called the Dixie Classic. They played in Dallas,

02:05.955 --> 02:10.039
but why would he want to come there instead of going 
to Rose Bowl? I sometimes think, well, Charlie

02:10.019 --> 02:18.209
Moran had 11 football players on that team from 
Fort Worth, Dallas, so maybe the recruiting was

02:10.019 --> 02:18.209
good there. Who knows? Very interesting game. Bo 
McMillan was their quarterback, top football

02:21.973 --> 02:26.819
player in America that year, later coached at 
Kansas. But Bo McMillan would have won the Heisman

02:26.859 --> 02:30.844
if they had won it. I like to think he made two 
mistakes that day. Right before the kickoff, he

02:34.949 --> 02:37.512
got married on the 50-yard line. And so he said, I 
do. The second thing he said was kick to that little

02:40.711 --> 02:43.655
guy in the corner. And the kickoff, Dr. Sanders, 
who the core center is named after, Little Sammy,

02:43.736 --> 02:49.925
ran the kickoff back 55 yards. And so they didn't 
kick to Little Sammy anymore. But you go with that

02:52.989 --> 03:00.200
game, and you say, what is it famous for? It's 
famous for the 12th man. And if you... Want to spin

03:05.808 --> 03:14.838
off of that, you can say, well, why was it famous, 
you know, the 12th man? And they'll say, well, of

03:14.878 --> 03:18.121
course, the 12th man never played football. He ran 
track, played basketball. I think 99.9% of people

03:20.684 --> 03:24.228
will tell you that. But if you research a little 
bit, you'll find that, yes, he did play against

03:24.328 --> 03:30.775
Texas the next year. He caught a 25-yard pass for a 
touchdown. And the score was tied 7 to 7 inside the

03:33.415 --> 03:36.968
last minute. He took another 25 to the 4. A&M scored 
and won 14 to 7, 19-22 against Texas. The Dixie

03:43.625 --> 03:46.650
Classic, of course, was January 2, 1922. So the 
next football season, you got a little bit of

03:47.211 --> 03:56.147
insight into the 12th man being an all-around 
football player. I'd mentioned earlier, we'll

03:56.467 --> 04:05.683
get back on Charlie Moran, he had umpired in either 
two or three World Series also, was an outstanding

03:56.467 --> 04:05.683
coach, but... I like to ask the question now after 
all of that garbage is why did A&M win? And you'll

04:11.228 --> 04:15.837
get everything from they had to fight in Texas 
Aggie spirit to whatever. I like to point and say

04:16.078 --> 04:29.443
right there at that case with the banner in it and 
with the pennant in it, I say I like to think A&M won

04:16.078 --> 04:29.443
that day because Center College came out wearing 
orange and white. and so those are the kind of

04:29.423 --> 04:58.654
things that you could you know you could you could 
throw in but but uh back uh back uh in my days again i

04:29.423 --> 04:58.654
remember uh my freshman year very very well uh we 
had we went out to the clay pits we were playing

04:29.423 --> 04:58.654
baylor and waco our unit didn't go to the game it was 
not a court trip but we were expected to go i can

04:29.423 --> 04:58.654
remember that Probably one of the greatest games 
A&M's ever played. I think we scored four times in

05:01.675 --> 05:09.472
the last 15 and a half minutes to come back and beat 
Baylor. We were down two touchdowns. It was one of

05:12.978 --> 05:19.027
those unbelievable games, and we listened to it on 
the radio out there, and I think we had a beer bus. Of

05:19.067 --> 05:23.494
course, it wasn't supposed to be drinking, but at 
all the parties there was alcohol, basically.

05:23.655 --> 05:25.638
Where were the clay pits? Out across Welborn Road. 
How far? I guess, if I want to remember right, it's

05:30.445 --> 05:34.431
probably seven miles or so. And then west? Mm-hmm. 
down in somebody's pasture.

05:41.438 --> 05:43.508
Was there supposed to be permission? I don't know. 
Of course, being a freshman, you never knew. And

05:46.982 --> 05:52.048
the only time I ever went was that freshman year of 
the Baylor game. I can remember Tuesday night yell

05:52.589 --> 05:55.853
practice. Some of the yellators

05:55.873 --> 06:07.167
were very upset that some of the units didn't go, 
and they knew that our unit actually went to the

06:07.147 --> 06:12.154
clay pits, and so we were singled out even with over 
4,000 freshmen in the corps. Our outfit got

06:12.174 --> 06:14.458
singled out that we didn't go to game. And so we 
were... Now, when people went to the clay pits,

06:15.159 --> 06:22.549
were there any women along ever? Not the, that was 
the only time I went. Now, I've seen pictures I've

06:27.076 --> 06:34.592
been through thousands of pictures in the course 
center and I've seen pictures of gals there. But

06:34.612 --> 06:35.895
usually it was all male, wasn't it? Oh, yeah. And 
did you skinny dip or did you wear a bathing suit? We

06:39.603 --> 06:41.928
always wore a bathing suit. Who brought the beer? I 
don't remember. I just remember it was always

06:44.426 --> 06:46.169
there, you know. Of course, as only going to it one 
time. Now, we had a lot of parties we would have

06:49.074 --> 06:55.486
through my junior and senior year, especially. We 
had a lot of parties with sororities or things. One

06:59.493 --> 07:03.939
of the best guys, it seemed like, at ranging 
parties was Dr. Gary Halter. He always seemed to

07:03.999 --> 07:05.442
have a connection. He was a year behind me. We used 
to hitchhike home together some. He was from

07:09.167 --> 07:10.329
Wichita Falls. But somebody would set up a party 
with a sorority, maybe, or even a dorm at Sam

07:10.429 --> 07:23.087
Houston or Texas, and two stories I can throw in 
right fast. We always had a court trip either to

07:23.067 --> 07:25.711
Fort Worth or to Dallas. And I can remember going to 
my post office box and, dear Box 5611, I'm Box 5611.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.881
My name is Yolanda . My wife says I never forget 
anything, but she could never understand why I

07:34.763 --> 07:40.651
couldn't remember anything when I was a freshman 
or in school. But I remember that a lot of guys what

07:45.916 --> 07:50.261
you consider a blind date based on their box mate at 
Tessie. Did this Tessie ask you for a date? No, but

07:52.123 --> 07:53.344
she was very friendly. But as I remember, I told you 
I was SHY with the capital SHY. So you didn't

07:57.309 --> 07:58.150
receive it. All I remember is Yolanda Mayhouse. 
But by the time I came a junior, we would have

08:00.312 --> 08:05.839
parties and blind dates. And I remember one that 
Gary was responsible for setting up over at Austin

08:05.859 --> 08:12.546
with somebody he knew. Pretty sure Gary did this 
one. And it was with a sorority, and I was a junior,

08:15.987 --> 08:24.276
and my roommate and I decided that we were going to 
make a lot of money, so we sold setups. We sold cokes

08:24.296 --> 08:29.621
and ice, and we probably made $70, $80 that night. 
We were in king cotton, but we had a fish dunkin'.

08:34.486 --> 08:39.852
Eddie Duncan had a blind date with a high school 
senior who was visiting, someone named... Linda

08:40.810 --> 08:41.812
Bird Johnson. And I can remember the Monday 
mornings, the only time I've ever heard a

08:42.513 --> 08:52.650
freshman, as we would say in the Corps, fart off or 
make fun of another freshman. That morning, the

08:54.974 --> 08:58.600
whistle jock blew the whistle and said, Fish 
Duncan went all the way with LBJ. And, of course,

09:01.880 --> 09:07.548
that was that slogan the same year that we were at 
the Baylor football game in Waco. And that was the

09:07.829 --> 09:10.653
Baylor game my freshman year we didn't go to. But 
junior year, I remember an airplane flew over

09:10.713 --> 09:16.321
dropping out leaflets. And it's when Lyndon 
Johnson was running for vice president and

09:16.341 --> 09:22.630
senator. And it said on the outside, don't be half 
safe. And then you opened it up and it said, strike

09:25.697 --> 09:28.343
LBJ twice. But those kind of things. But we did have 
a lot of parties and dates. A lot of guys, the dances

09:33.596 --> 09:37.986
were always big. I don't think in the time I was at 
A&M I ever had a date for a dance down here. You know,

09:43.119 --> 09:58.934
first place, it cost a little bit of money, and 
you'd have dates out of town or go home with

09:43.119 --> 09:58.934
somebody, but having somebody come in here and pay 
all of that, but I think the majority of the people

09:43.119 --> 09:58.934
did, though. As far as you remember, how were women 
treated at A&M social events? I'll give you an

10:05.600 --> 10:07.281
example. G. Raleigh White, I missed one 
basketball game in five years, even though I told

10:08.189 --> 10:15.195
you I worked the intramurals four years. I can 
remember if a girl was there, especially walking

10:15.563 --> 10:32.345
up those stairs, how the animals would all, 
certain girls, you know, and they would have to

10:15.563 --> 10:32.345
come, if they came to our dorm, there was not the 
lounges that were there when I came back to teach

10:15.563 --> 10:32.345
ROTC in the 70s between the dorms. They'd have to 
sit out there on the cement block or stairs, I mean

10:32.726 --> 10:39.715
steps out there. you could call it a bench but it'd 
be a funny name for it but uh uh then the cat calls the

10:39.695 --> 11:02.192
names uh but now after that at the the senior ball oh 
yes they uh they were treated like royalty yeah

10:39.695 --> 11:02.192
they oh definitely definitely because most of the 
time there was girls that were coming from off

10:39.695 --> 11:02.192
campus and and also uh girls uh uh it was kind of 
unwritten ruled that a lot of girls didn't date,

11:02.628 --> 11:10.281
didn't date, local girls didn't date Aggies, or 
Allen Academy. At that time, I know I did go out some

11:10.682 --> 11:17.654
with one of the, in fact, he was my psychology prof. 
I went out with his daughter some, and I roomed with

11:17.674 --> 11:22.122
a guy my, and part of my senior year until I went to 
staff the third week. I was always dating local

11:26.147 --> 11:37.843
girls, but it was kind of a, and most of the girls 
that would come in here were ones that they had

11:26.147 --> 11:37.843
dated from their home or high school or whatever. 
Describe being a freshman on a court trip. The

11:43.190 --> 11:49.138
first thing I remember is somehow I got to the Rice 
game. And I remember that we stayed at the Rice

11:49.777 --> 11:56.367
Hotel, and I think there were 14 of us that stayed in 
the room that night. And I remember we did not, my

11:57.229 --> 12:05.321
freshman year, we did not have a party. But most of 
the other court trips after my freshman year, we'd

12:05.342 --> 12:15.177
always have parties, and the blind dates would be 
arranged and everything. You got there, somebody

12:15.157 --> 12:17.260
had a car. I think in my outfit, probably one out of 
every four guys had an automobile, five guys,

12:18.041 --> 12:27.836
maybe even less. But you always managed to get a 
ride, and it was kind of like the big thing then, of

12:27.856 --> 12:37.992
course, were the hometown clubs, because 
especially if you lived a good ways, from the

12:38.765 --> 12:42.030
campus because that's how you could figure out how 
you get home. You stayed in contact with the people

12:42.070 --> 12:45.415
going back, maybe Wichita Falls. Even though, as I 
say, I hitchhiked home a lot back and forth. Not

12:49.362 --> 12:50.163
that much, but. Describe hitchhiking to your 
expert. Usually wear your uniform because it

12:53.688 --> 12:55.812
helped. I had an old leather suitcase and I had that 
that T, which everybody knew it stood for A&M on it.

13:01.973 --> 13:06.524
And you might, from here to Jacksboro, it might 
take 13 different people. You never even had any

13:07.887 --> 13:14.644
ill feelings or fear or anything about 
hitchhiking. You and nowadays of course

13:14.945 --> 13:41.020
everybody knows you you got to be afraid of the 
person picking you up as well as the person you're

13:14.945 --> 13:41.020
picking up, but I can remember to the well to this 
day I might go through Marlin or somewhere and I'll

13:14.945 --> 13:41.020
see a Intersection there a country far in the 
market road and just remember being there Fort

13:14.945 --> 13:41.020
Worth for an example if you happen to go that way 
instead of cutting through a Meridian, Clifton,

13:41.506 --> 13:46.256
Stephenville, Highco, that direction, Middle 
Wales to get to Jacksonville. A lot of times that

13:46.636 --> 13:59.903
road going on north through Fort Worth, you'd have 
to get out, and you'd have to walk all the way across

13:46.636 --> 13:59.903
Fort Worth, which probably was what we thought was 
a long ways, but was probably a couple of miles to

13:46.636 --> 13:59.903
get to Jacksonville. to Henderson Street or 
Jacksboro Highway, as they call it. Were there

14:03.591 --> 14:06.858
kind of special places where you'd hitchhike? 
Sure. Out of Waco, Highway 6, where it used to come

14:07.179 --> 14:13.852
in, there was the shed that you'd always gather 
there. Out here, just right outside Eastgate

14:17.078 --> 14:25.431
here, Eastgate Lounge with the bus station and all 
that on down to where University Towers is is where

14:17.078 --> 14:25.431
people would go. And there was kind of a standard 
rule. You waited your turn. You didn't go and get in

14:29.237 --> 14:31.861
front of somebody, you know. And hopefully the 
cars coming would pick the first guys up. And so it

14:38.011 --> 14:40.875
was like standing in line for a sale. on the day 
after Christmas, you know, you just don't go and

14:41.024 --> 14:44.367
get in front of those people. And you might get out 
of an old pickup into an air-conditioned car, you

14:45.448 --> 14:51.735
know. Did you ever have any negative experience? 
About the only negative experience was I was

14:55.919 --> 15:04.808
wondering what I was doing when I'm out there still 
11 o'clock at night trying to get home. Nobody ever

15:04.848 --> 15:06.610
took a problem? shot at me or anything, any kind of 
what you'd call the advances you worry about or

15:07.315 --> 15:14.144
being robbed or anything. Probably the best 
experience I ever had was a guy picked me up outside

15:15.927 --> 15:20.453
of Jacksburg going to Houston. And when he got up to 
in front of the campus, I pointed over there to Dorm

15:25.540 --> 15:30.727
2 because you didn't have the oceanography, 
meteorology, or any of those buildings. I said,

15:30.747 --> 15:32.289
that's my dorm with the lights. And I can just 
remember he says, son, I brought you this for you.

15:35.493 --> 15:37.456
I'm going to take you to your door. But you didn't 
think anything about it. I grew up, we wanted to go

15:42.823 --> 15:45.186
swimming in Graham. We hitchhiked there. All 
right, back to academics. Was the second semester

15:49.252 --> 15:51.677
better, your freshman year? Second semester was a 
little bit better. I never was below, the entire

15:54.842 --> 16:05.301
time I was in school here, I never was below a C 
average, but I never did really do anything.

16:05.517 --> 16:13.131
Probably did the best my junior year when I would 
have had what you call a three-point, a little over

16:05.517 --> 16:13.131
a three-point that one semester. But I was taking 
18 hours that semester, too. But I didn't learn to

16:15.736 --> 16:23.290
manage my time probably till my junior year. Did 
you ever during that freshman year ever think

16:23.624 --> 16:27.848
about dropping out of school? Only one time. I 
guess when I was losing so much weight that before

16:29.649 --> 16:37.456
probably about the fifth or sixth week. And I 
remember my father only told me two things

16:37.777 --> 16:43.802
referenced by going to A&M. One was he told me to, 
well, can I wait till the end of the semester, which

16:43.822 --> 16:49.147
I did. The other time at the end of my sophomore 
year, I was going to drop out of school. and I joined

16:53.611 --> 17:13.358
the Marines and so I quit going to class and I

16:53.611 --> 17:13.358
was working as an intramural manager and I would 
sign up the tennis that spring out on the tennis

16:53.611 --> 17:13.358
court and so I would play tennis from five o'clock 
till sometimes stay there because I was I was now a

17:13.338 --> 17:14.239
junior. I didn't have to worry about formation. We 
might play 7, 8 o'clock at night. I would just stay

17:18.243 --> 17:19.705
over there. And that's when, at the end of the 
semester, I told my daddy I was going to join the

17:19.725 --> 17:25.190
Marines. And he said, no, he wished I wouldn't. And 
so I kind of turned my act around after that. It took

17:31.797 --> 17:41.607
me, I was still majoring in pre-vet after four 
semesters, having flunked freshman chemistry

17:31.797 --> 17:41.607
twice and English. And, you know, knowing, but I 
didn't have any idea I wasn't going to get, but it

17:41.587 --> 17:48.840
was, I was in the, I wanted to stay in the company 
that I was in. Grades were not, I was still passing.

17:52.847 --> 17:59.419
So, I guess, you know, I just came back my junior 
year. I looked around and I said, what, what can I

17:59.439 --> 18:02.785
major in? that was still in the agricultural 
arena.

18:08.973 --> 18:13.678
And I looked at, in the Department of Ag, Eco, and 
Rural Sociology, I looked at rural sociology. And

18:13.758 --> 18:16.601
I took a couple of courses over there. And the 
professors were truly outstanding. Dr. Russell.

18:25.251 --> 18:26.112
Describe him. Dr. Russell, Dr. Dan, the grade 
point man, probably one of the most interesting

18:32.279 --> 18:39.252
individuals we'll ever meet and when I was 
involved the other day in helping Dr. Bowen on

18:39.738 --> 19:01.278
getting the ring back here, the Prisoner of War, I 
mean, keep thinking of that, the Medal of Honor

18:39.738 --> 19:01.278
ring, I told him, because he was so enthused about 
that, I said, you need to go to the library and get

18:39.738 --> 19:01.278
out Dr. Russell's scrapbook over there in the old 
library, Cushing, and read about the project

18:39.738 --> 19:01.278
houses that he was involved in. That is the most 
amazing piece of, or collection of articles and

19:07.700 --> 19:15.078
letters and things that I've seen on this campus, 
what the project houses were about and all of that.

19:15.118 --> 19:19.448
But he was a tremendous individual, had had a lot of 
experience. going to graduate school, worked as a

19:19.715 --> 19:23.959
bartender in Chicago during Al Capone's days. So 
he had some good stories. Been on the board of

19:25.240 --> 19:30.505
pardon and parole, I guess, for the state. And I had 
Dr. Sperbonik, who was. Stay with Russia. OK.

19:35.310 --> 19:36.251
Describe him. I don't know. What physically? Kind 
of a heavy set, a white haired gentleman, kind of

19:39.073 --> 19:44.518
the Santa Claus looking. He was so interested in 
students. I know his. His wife, they live just a few

19:49.803 --> 19:54.728
houses from where my wife grew up here a block off 
campus. And her brother was in charge of the

19:55.568 --> 20:01.794
recreation department of the city of Dallas. So he 
had even got me a job up there one summer, because I

20:01.874 --> 20:08.040
thought that might be the area that I want to go. I 
didn't do it. Didn't take the job, but I got offered

20:10.322 --> 20:12.864
the job through him. But he was just a very caring 
individual. And I think at that time, we thought he

20:17.228 --> 20:19.050
was rather old. Like most of us, I thought my first 
grade teacher was old, but she was still teaching

20:21.407 --> 20:27.498
when I graduated from college. But he was an 
individual that was pretty easy grading. I think

20:34.230 --> 20:37.275
one of the things that he did for me which I didn't 
realize it at the time. My senior year, there was a

20:40.252 --> 21:07.397
two-hour class about Boy Scouts, and at that time I 
thought I might want to go to work for the Scouts

20:40.252 --> 21:07.397
too, and so I had a Scout troop at the Bryan Boys 
Club, Hispanic young men who, we never had a

20:40.252 --> 21:07.397
uniform, but every Monday night we had Scout 
meeting there, and at that time I had an

20:40.252 --> 21:07.397
automobile, so I would take them home after Scout 
meeting, they would get there by themselves, and

21:07.816 --> 21:10.418
we'd meet for about an hour and a half and I remember 
taken them camping out here at some land Dr. Dan

21:10.651 --> 21:14.737
had. But he was a truly, I put him in the same boat as 
some of the other people that I was involved with,

21:16.079 --> 21:24.973
like Mr. Penberthy or Mr. Gay. And

21:25.954 --> 21:35.990
Professor Russell, what was his style in class? 
What was his manner of? Very, very easygoing. a

21:39.575 --> 21:42.719
nice guy, so nice nobody would take advantage of. 
And I think though, I think the rural sociology

21:43.340 --> 22:00.064
department was very small, a pretty tight group, 
and there wasn't any, I think the people that were

21:43.340 --> 22:00.064
in that department, majoring in there, it wasn't 
considered a department you go, even though the

22:00.179 --> 22:03.863
curriculum was not as tough as some of them. But it 
was kind of an off-the-wall major, and a lot of the

22:03.883 --> 22:09.969
people that were in there, it seemed to me, were 
from small towns. And I think that back then, that

22:10.089 --> 22:12.752
really made a difference. Right. And you started 
to mention some other folks. Oh, yeah. I had Dr.

22:15.996 --> 22:18.999
Skrobonek, who was such a tremendous. And to this 
day, I've had many, many opportunities to be

22:20.000 --> 22:25.005
around him. Excuse me one second.
