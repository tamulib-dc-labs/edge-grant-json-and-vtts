WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:08.802
We did a lot of practice coastal shooting.

00:08.902 --> 00:25.222
You

00:08.902 --> 00:25.222
said you'd shoot a lot of drones and stuff like 
that, sleds. Beg your pardon? A lot of practice.

00:28.086 --> 00:29.808
Practice, practice, practice every day. Okay. 
That's all it was, was practice. Okay.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.822
Were you eager to get overseas? A bit. Because here 
we are in 1943, you don't get overseas until 1944.

00:52.631 --> 00:53.612
That's right. The war starts for us in 1941. you 
have all this training, I would imagine that being

00:56.950 --> 01:08.126
a training officer might be a little frustrating 
for a man that wanted to, a man who stayed in the

00:56.950 --> 01:08.126
reserves during the 1930s. Well, okay, that's 
right. I had my chance to go overseas and my good

01:12.273 --> 01:23.870
friend

01:12.273 --> 01:23.870
got me out of it, replaced me, and I'm here because 
of it. But anyway, here, and

01:26.330 --> 01:36.884
I stayed there until August 1, 1944, at Fort Meade. 
And I was transferred to the

01:36.904 --> 01:48.540
headquartered field artillery Fort Jackson, 
South Carolina. Fort Jackson, South Carolina,

01:50.377 --> 01:52.039
right. And you were the executive officer there in 
1944. I was executive officer there. And was that

01:57.744 --> 01:59.926
the same type job, more training? No, this was a 
combat outfit. Oh, so you were preparing for

02:04.750 --> 02:06.372
Europe? That was going to Europe, that's right. 
And I went down there as the exec officer of the

02:09.935 --> 02:14.399
group. OK, so now this is the first time in your 
military career Now August 1, 1944 finally you are

02:19.553 --> 02:32.206
assigned to go overseas and now Fort Jackson is a 
deployment station basically. That's correct.

02:36.310 --> 02:39.934
He got it in there. Then I was in the combat unit and 
we trained for combat.

02:48.055 --> 02:50.618
Here are another breaks that you get.

03:14.166 --> 03:17.590
I was chaffing the bit and talking to every 
artillery personnel officer I could talk to about

03:17.806 --> 03:21.630
getting into combat. And of course, they always 
say, well, just hold your horses. Just hold your

03:25.954 --> 03:26.795
horses.

03:31.059 --> 03:45.754
And my good commanding officer from Fort Sill days 
was scheduled to go into combat all

03:31.059 --> 03:45.754
middle of September, 44. He was down at, he was over 
at Fort Rucker with an outfit that he had built up

03:47.118 --> 03:55.811
and trained and he would get taken overseas. And 
somehow he had

03:57.394 --> 04:14.841
accumulated or acquired a

03:57.394 --> 04:14.841
distrust of an executive officer. An executive 
officer in the commanding officer got to be just

04:17.560 --> 04:20.503
like a hand in glove. You got to think alike, and 
squad alike, and run alike, and everything. And he

04:27.490 --> 04:35.778
had acquired

04:27.490 --> 04:35.778
a dislike for his executive officer.

04:38.740 --> 04:45.627
And the night before they were supposed to ship out 
of Fort Rucker, they had a party. This executive

04:46.737 --> 04:52.524
officer got drunk.

04:52.544 --> 04:58.872
And Colonel Mays, you know, kind of like Ford and 
electric, like to pull the switch and right out it

04:52.544 --> 04:58.872
comes on. So Colonel Mays had him put in the 
hospital and went down there and talked with the

04:59.713 --> 05:09.024
doctor, one of his old regular army buddies. He 
said, you keep that son of a bitch in here. I'm

05:12.568 --> 05:14.130
shipping out tomorrow, and I don't want him. So you 
just keep him here for a week. under observation or

05:16.707 --> 05:20.853
diagnosis or, you know, how doctors can do. And by 
that time, we'd be gone. In other words, he just

05:24.338 --> 05:26.962
cleaned his dirt and in right then. And he called 
me, or had his

05:28.444 --> 05:41.382
adjutant call me up at Camp Jackson and asked me if I 
wanted to go overseas with Colonel Mays. I said,

05:42.762 --> 05:45.385
hell yes, I want to go overseas with Colonel Mays. 
Nobody that I'd like to go overseas more with. But

05:48.629 --> 05:51.252
here, I'm an executive. It's outfit. And I don't 
know whether I can get a lift from here or not. And he

05:54.076 --> 05:55.938
said, now, you've got to go tomorrow. You've got to 
leave there tonight so we can leave. We go from

05:58.121 --> 05:59.322
Kilmer tomorrow. And he was the executive 
officer, Colonel Walter Jenkins. And I'm sure

06:07.712 --> 06:09.414
Colonel Mays was sitting there. He sat there and 
did this all the time. Nervous habit he had

06:12.732 --> 06:14.534
accumulated. I see him chewing on his thumbnail 
right now. Who's his executive officer? Colonel

06:20.921 --> 06:21.982
Walter Jenkins. Oh. Asked if he wants to go again. 
Are you sure you want to go with Colonel Jenkins?

06:28.528 --> 06:28.989
Hell yeah. Let me talk to Colonel Jenkins. And he 
said, Walter, the old SOB, and they live next

06:32.433 --> 06:42.503
quarter, some back 1925 or 30, see, and Back in the 
old Army days, they were old, old Army people. So

06:46.248 --> 06:47.971
the guy that was in the hospital was? No, this is my 
then-Colonel. Oh, I see. And my old Colonel was

06:51.215 --> 06:53.839
talking, and they were old buddies. Oh, I see. And 
my Colonel, I mean Colonel Mays, said, now Walter,

06:56.643 --> 07:02.291
I want the kid to go overseas with my executive. 
You're not going to get stanged away, are you? You

07:03.633 --> 07:08.800
know you want to go overseas, and that boy wants to 
go overseas, so why don't you come on and let him go

07:03.633 --> 07:08.800
overseas with me? Colonel Jenkins said, you want 
to go overseas with Colonel Mays? I said, yes, sir.

07:12.892 --> 07:13.833
Give him my right arm. He says, OK. That's all there 
was to it. So I had about seven hours to get packed,

07:19.558 --> 07:29.048
get on the plane, and fly to Camp Kilmer, which is 
right out of New York. And I was gone. No kidding.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.333
Yeah. And so there's another break. See, this 
history that I built up at Fort Seal and

07:35.874 --> 07:41.700
Leavenworth, Helping you all the time. Gave me 
breaks. And these are the breaks I'm talking

07:44.747 --> 07:48.090
about. That's why I got promoted so fast. That's 
why I got overseas when I did. And so you joined,

07:53.775 --> 08:00.561
then you joined the 407th Field Artillery Group 
overseas. Well, I joined with Camp Kilmer, and we

08:00.982 --> 08:03.424
were gone the next day. Yeah, for overseas. For 
overseas. And you were the executive officer

08:04.805 --> 08:06.607
there. I was an executive officer there. And this 
is 1944. Yeah.

08:14.536 --> 08:22.085
September

08:14.536 --> 08:22.085
14, 1944.

08:25.910 --> 08:28.633
And did you go to Britain first or did you go right 
into France? No, we went into France. There again,

08:30.736 --> 08:35.782
I was brand new to this outfit. I met them up there 
and got to know them over one meal, you know, this

08:35.802 --> 08:40.448
headquarters.

08:43.471 --> 08:43.952
And, uh, They didn't know me, and I didn't know 
them, and I'd just talk and pop it off.

08:53.590 --> 08:58.258
Trying to get acquainted with them, except for 
Colonel Mays, I didn't know any of them. And the old

08:58.278 --> 09:04.729
man, and of course I soldiered with him for two and a 
half, maybe off and on three years. I knew how he

09:06.251 --> 09:12.842
thought, and he knew how I would react, and we'd get 
along fine. I could see Owen, he's like, shoot.

09:21.488 --> 09:28.316
Kidding these people about

09:21.488 --> 09:28.316
what we're going to see overseas on. You know, all 
rumors starting, and delivered ships, and

09:29.197 --> 09:38.227
victory ships, and merchant marines, and going on 
a garbage scowl. And I said, oh, hell, if you want

09:38.247 --> 09:42.412
me, I'll get you on a first class ship. You know, 
just talking. And we left Kilmer on a barge, went up

09:45.290 --> 09:52.319
the river, East River or whatever it is. It was 
driving rain, all of us out there on this damn

09:52.339 --> 09:57.145
barge. It got soaking wet and everything. Went in 
at water level and opened door and you could see

09:59.948 --> 10:05.555
lights in there. Of course, they got doors down at 
water level. And they had a man there checking

10:09.420 --> 10:14.166
names, Colonel Lieutenant Colonel Gregory 
Kibble checked my name off, and some fella grabbed

10:14.669 --> 10:23.239
me by the shoulder and said, here, Colonel, you go 
with me. Led me in to the elevator, and that was the

10:24.200 --> 10:29.527
first time I knew that we were on the Queen 
Elizabeth. Really? Yeah. So the next day or two, I

10:32.270 --> 10:41.181
saw these people, and I asked them, I said, now, is 
this first class enough for you? But I went

10:41.201 --> 10:42.502
overseas on the elevator. Of course, We were an 
emergency shipment. And we went off somewhere off

10:49.585 --> 10:52.549
of Cherbourg, France. Got on a British liner, a 
lighter they call them, which is a small ship. And

11:01.019 --> 11:05.003
they took us into Omaha Beach, actually. That was, 
oh heck, that was three months after D-Day. And by

11:11.471 --> 11:14.815
that time, the engineers had built up ponton wharf 
out on floating pontons. And we walked right off of

11:21.874 --> 11:30.604
this ladder onto pontons and walked right down a 
ponton bridge to land. And of course, this all

11:32.926 --> 11:35.289
happens at nighttime, too. And raining, God, it 
was miserable. But the welcoming we had, we went up

11:40.275 --> 11:44.920
through the first, or maybe between the first and 
29th division cemeteries. On the side of the hill

11:53.084 --> 11:56.429
and we go up this trail in between them. Of course 
the first and the 29th, they lost 80 to 90 percent of

11:56.449 --> 12:02.918
their people on that original landing operation.

12:07.345 --> 12:12.392
God, I never saw so many crows in all my life.

12:12.608 --> 12:15.411
I told the colonel, I said, this is a hell of a 
welcoming we're getting. I remember saying that

12:15.732 --> 12:17.714
to him. But we went into Omaha and turned back 
around towards Congress. And Vallone stayed

12:25.983 --> 12:39.358
there for two or three days, and then we moved down 
south and got into the fighting down towards St.

12:25.983 --> 12:39.358
Mary Glees and St. Louis. into the pocket. They 
called it the pocket and then the breaking out of

12:41.434 --> 12:51.211
the pocket that's when it turned back into towards 
Brittany. Now what Army group are you with? Who is

12:53.014 --> 12:54.056
the commanding general? We're in the Third Army, 
General Patton's Army. We stayed in General

12:59.084 --> 13:05.515
Patton's Army in the Third Army until

13:09.697 --> 13:11.520
Oh, let me see here. We got out of there and got up.

13:25.981 --> 13:27.142
What did you think of General Panton? Did you have 
an opportunity to meet him? Well, no. To talk to him

13:30.287 --> 13:32.951
like you and I are talking, I never did. I've been in 
a lot of conferences with him. He was a tremendous

13:36.236 --> 13:39.180
person, a tremendous commander. He was a great 
soldier. He

13:42.315 --> 13:50.685
was an outstanding leader. I admired him 
tremendously as a man and a person and a soldier.

14:01.557 --> 14:06.703
Any wrongs that he had, if he had any wrongs, were 
covering up an inferiority complex that he had, in

14:07.865 --> 14:14.392
my humble opinion. He was

14:14.412 --> 14:23.041
not too large a stature man.

14:25.764 --> 14:32.151
And he had been bypassed two or three times in Army 
promotions. And he had an inferiority complex, in

14:33.593 --> 14:37.737
my humble opinion, about this. He was a vulgar man, 
but a deeply religious Christian man. And his

14:45.372 --> 14:51.161
vulgarity to me was a smoke screen.

14:51.241 --> 14:56.590
That's my

14:51.241 --> 14:56.590
analysis of General Patton. He was a great 
soldier. What was it like sitting in conferences

14:59.174 --> 15:01.437
with him? Well, he was a very, very... Ship shape is 
bang, bang, bang. I'm sure he had briefed his

15:11.136 --> 15:29.402
people beforehand, his intimate staff, of what he 
was going to do, and it was just a laying out

15:11.136 --> 15:29.402
orientation as far as his staff conference was 
concerned at my level.

15:32.867 --> 15:36.192
I'm sure that his personal staff me and his exec, 
his jeet, one, two, three, and four, those people,

15:36.897 --> 15:44.985
immediate close staff. He was a hell of a work for 
us, because he was so demanding. But at my level,

15:51.531 --> 16:01.340
we'd come in and get instructions and pick up 
overlays, which you operated off of, overlay on a

15:51.531 --> 16:01.340
map. And he was a typical high-type executive. He 
says, this is what we're going to do, and pointed

16:08.302 --> 16:13.889
out on the map, and this is the reason why. And the 
17th Division is going to do this, and the 29th

16:13.929 --> 16:22.561
Division is going to do that, and the 4th Division 
is going to do this. And this is what we could do. And

16:26.145 --> 16:28.909
we could do it in so many hours or so many days. And 
that's it. And that was his final instruction to

16:31.953 --> 16:38.241
his division commanders and corps commanders 
and, of course, I'm Lieutenant Colonel sitting on

16:39.352 --> 16:43.297
the back of the peanut roost. But he was a great 
soldier. You can't take it away from him. And I

16:50.465 --> 16:55.631
don't know anybody that didn't have the greatest 
admiration and respect for him. He was a driver.

16:59.316 --> 16:59.496
Oh, yeah. But I've seen him down in the firefights 
where lieutenants ought to be in. And he down there

17:05.303 --> 17:06.304
called them. Sergeant, this section chief is 
telling him, watch it, tanks coming off to the left

17:06.740 --> 17:13.110
or coming off to the right, and here he comes 
through the bushes, get him. Goddamn, get him,

17:13.470 --> 17:14.953
Sergeant, get him, get him. Boom. It was like this. 
But that was General Patton.

17:22.865 --> 17:25.509
He was a great soldier, a great person. And I'll say 
this, he died like he wanted to die. He's still on

17:29.415 --> 17:32.359
tops, and...

17:36.355 --> 17:41.480
He was a dedicated soldier and he delivered the 
goods. And I'm satisfied that we got out of that war

17:43.202 --> 17:50.169
many months sooner than had he not been there. And 
months means many American lives. Had he not been

17:54.113 --> 17:58.497
there. Because he had the capabilities of

18:04.250 --> 18:06.432
demanding and making people like it.

18:12.018 --> 18:13.921
I don't know what more to say about men. Now, as the 
XO of the Field Artillery Group, tell me about that

18:15.222 --> 18:22.069
job. Well, that job, the group has from normally 
three to up to five or six battalions of artillery.

18:32.481 --> 18:33.582
It's like a regiment. made up normally of three or 
four battalions. So Patton would say something

18:37.182 --> 18:45.134
like, he needs so many guns here or so many over 
there, and he'd tell your colonel and your colonel

18:37.182 --> 18:45.134
and give you the word. That's right, he'd put them 
there. And we were an Army artillery assigned to

18:47.077 --> 18:52.685
corps. We operated through corps, but our 
direction was by Army, meaning the 3rd Army at that

18:52.725 --> 18:57.993
time. And they would concentrate our field 
artillery wherever they needed the firepower. he

19:04.578 --> 19:09.104
could see from his intelligence that they could 
have trouble here, they could have trouble there.

19:10.386 --> 19:15.874
And he would send extra artillery to supplement 
his own firepower. And that was our job. His

19:19.018 --> 19:24.105
supportive role, combat supportive role. And my 
job as battalion, as a group exec, was to keep my

19:34.936 --> 20:03.677
commanding uh commander informed of the status of 
everything in his group plus the daily contact

19:34.936 --> 20:03.677
with those people because the old man has always 
gone to conference or something and he'd tell me

19:34.936 --> 20:03.677
check on this check on that i want this done i go do it 
and i i know the preparations are going on from

19:34.936 --> 20:03.677
visiting the motor parks or the gun parks I know the 
supply situation. I know the food situation, the

20:06.429 --> 20:14.896
ammunition situation, everything else, to give 
him the answers. I'd go to him and tell him when it

20:14.916 --> 20:27.527
was adequate or it was, we had what we called a 
combat load, which is a day's fire that you carry

20:14.916 --> 20:27.527
with you all the time, meaning a day's ammunition. 
And I could tell him tonight that we had one day's

20:34.741 --> 20:38.645
Fire, three days fire, we've got a half day's fire. 
And he knew whether to build a fire under the

20:38.665 --> 20:48.354
ordinance up at Third Army, for instance, we need 
some more bullets. Or we need some more groceries.

20:51.857 --> 20:53.659
Or say, how about our PX supplies? We haven't been 
getting them lately. Meaning cigarettes, and

20:56.281 --> 21:00.325
chewing gum, and beer, and this kind of thing. So 
you were keeping the Army moving forward, then?

21:02.667 --> 21:03.708
That's right. That's right. But it was a fine job. 
It was a good training job. And

21:08.946 --> 21:15.973
I did a good job for him. And consequently- Is that 
why you were promoted to CO then? No, I was

21:21.259 --> 21:22.520
lieutenant colonel. But you were still promoted 
to the commanding officer of the 777. Well, I

21:28.246 --> 21:29.187
wasn't promoted. I was transferred because The 
777FA battalion lost him. He screwed up, is what he

21:39.789 --> 21:41.071
did. Battalion commander. And the colonel sent me 
down there as his replacement. And so I was still a

21:48.201 --> 21:51.326
lieutenant colonel. Right. But would you 
consider coming back, though, to your own command

21:52.708 --> 21:57.214
of promotions? I got a command. Well, surely it's a 
promotion in a sense, but you think of promotions

21:58.115 --> 22:04.384
meaning a promotion in grade. It's a delegation of 
a lot more responsibility. So I had the 777 FAA

22:10.794 --> 22:19.026
battalion, and I stayed there for, oh gosh, I don't 
know how long. And then I got the 745

22:20.248 --> 22:30.263
FAA battalion, which was a heavy artillery, which 
was 8-inch howitz battalion. And it required a

22:31.946 --> 22:34.810
whole bunch more preparation and work and that 
kind of things. What did you think of American

22:40.595 --> 22:46.141
armaments during the Second World War compared to 
the Germans? It was good. Of course, the German

22:46.802 --> 22:52.248
armament was worn out. That's a better word than 
wore out.

22:58.696 --> 23:05.944
They didn't have the maintenance capabilities 
and the replacement capabilities that we did.

23:08.236 --> 23:09.598
They were good artillerymen. Their philosophy 
was basically the same as ours of point targets.

23:17.849 --> 23:23.216
And they were trained to shoot at a point target 
rather than an area fire like the Russians. The

23:23.236 --> 23:25.579
Russian artillery are not trained in point 
targets at all. They're trained in area fire. And

23:28.043 --> 23:33.009
they have artillery divisions, meaning a 
division of nothing but artillerymen. They may

23:33.550 --> 23:37.956
have 12, 15,000 artillerymen with maybe 500 guns.

23:41.726 --> 23:51.740
And they neutralized an area, but they couldn't 
hit a bull and maize with a base fiddle. They're not

23:51.760 --> 23:52.782
trained that way. They don't have that 
capabilities. The German army did until late in

23:55.225 --> 23:58.790
the war. Their equipment was worn out. They didn't 
have any replacement equipment. And our basement

24:05.740 --> 24:07.082
story The experience that we had, when I was in 
later from 777, I got to 745 at that time, which is

24:08.176 --> 24:19.887
8-inch howitzer battalion. Finest artillery 
piece made then and now, as far as artillery, fixed

24:19.907 --> 24:27.875
artillery.

24:27.895 --> 24:36.883
And we were running, of course, ammunition was a 
big problem with them because 8-inch howitzers,

24:27.895 --> 24:36.883
it's... Just big. Just a little bit larger than 
155. 155

24:41.535 --> 24:46.382
millimeters is roughly six inches. And 
eight-inch high would be about 200 millimeters.

24:54.413 --> 24:59.421
204, 5 millimeters, they called it each. And we 
were going helter-skelter chasing Germans, and

24:59.441 --> 25:06.010
they ran off and left a bunch of their equipment 
because they didn't have Gasoline to hold it out.

25:09.180 --> 25:10.121
Whereabouts was this? Well, this is in Germany. 
This is deep in Germany. Okay, so we're in 1945 now.

25:13.806 --> 25:19.234
We're in 1945.

25:19.775 --> 25:22.839
Let's see. But this wasn't in France after you 
landed. They still had the gasoline then. Oh,

25:26.705 --> 25:31.492
yeah, they had gasoline then, or they were running 
short on it. And what did you find when you picked up

25:31.852 --> 25:35.177
their old pieces? Well. We overran them, and at 
that time we were, because we'd broken through and

25:37.107 --> 25:52.107
we fired practically all of our bullets, we were on 
a ration of two rounds per battery per day. Is that

25:53.989 --> 25:54.630
all? Two rounds. That's all we had. We may have had a 
day's combat fire, but you can't tell at what time

25:56.633 --> 26:02.380
of night the hell's going to break out and we need 
it. So to keep our guns calibrated, and keep our map

26:06.301 --> 26:10.365
coordinates fired in, we called it. We fired two 
rounds per battery per day,

26:11.626 --> 26:25.499
proving out the metrological information we got 
and our survey data and all this kind of stuff.

26:26.700 --> 26:33.326
And when we overran these 88s, we overran a 
battalion of them. They were all in place.

26:35.680 --> 26:57.367
ammunition stacked up beside pine trees, and

26:35.680 --> 26:57.367
either the general or our colonel decided, the 
Corps artillery officer or my group commander

26:35.680 --> 26:57.367
decided that we'd do our harassing fire with 88s, 
Save American Bullets. And you could use those? We

26:59.069 --> 27:01.752
used them, yeah. But going down there and working 
on them, You could have 20 mils of deflection air

27:07.000 --> 27:14.368
worn out. We call it lost motion. That's the 
artilleryman's phrase for loose joint, so to

27:16.971 --> 27:21.536
speak. Like this doesn't fit snug, so it's got so 
much lost motion in it.

27:28.764 --> 27:34.290
You could raise and lower the tube of the gun 20 mils 
of lost motion. No wonder they weren't so

27:37.663 --> 27:39.906
accurate. Well, 20 mils at 10,000 yards is several 
hundred yards. Sure. 1,000 yards maybe. And the

27:48.458 --> 27:49.880
same thing in deflection. I'm sure some of those 
guns had 30 mils deflection there in lost motion.

27:55.949 --> 27:57.691
They could point this way and shoot this way.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.740
And that's the condition we found the artillery 
in. Now, this was late in the war. But

28:05.742 --> 28:07.384
nevertheless, that's what they were using. They 
didn't have the replacement capabilities that we

28:08.025 --> 28:14.773
did. I mean, we get a weapon like that. If we had two 
or three degrees loss of motion, we'd scrap it.

28:21.321 --> 28:22.061
We'd junk it. And the easiest way to do that is to 
lose it in battle. All it takes is a commander to

28:26.006 --> 28:29.971
write a certificate that it's lost in battle, and 
that's it. You don't have to mess with it, as far as

28:30.812 --> 28:35.057
accountability is concerned. and you go get your 
new one. And that's the way that worked. It saved

28:43.392 --> 28:49.459
you lots of problems and it kept your fire 
accurate. Now tell me about the 94th Division

28:50.079 --> 28:59.971
artillery, which you also learned your next 
assignment. All right. The next thing that

29:02.193 --> 29:04.656
happened after I got rid of the...

29:05.615 --> 29:14.826
At the end of the war, I was the C.O. of the 745th 
African Battalion, the armistice, or the D-Day, I

29:14.846 --> 29:21.534
mean the... In May 1945. Yeah, the V.E. Day.

29:27.561 --> 29:28.542
And... But before we get to that, can I change the 
topic for just a second? I'd like to ask you a

29:31.546 --> 29:35.250
question about going into Germany. Yeah. What did 
you think of the German people when you went into

29:37.566 --> 29:42.954
Germany, and how did they act toward you? Well, the 
German people, we didn't see too

29:42.974 --> 29:52.089
many Germans, because we were in smaller towns.

29:54.833 --> 30:01.744
Any German people we saw were old people, decrepit 
people. thoroughly beaten people, kick-dog

30:02.534 --> 30:06.779
people, if that's a good way to say it. Anybody that 
was able physically moved back as the German army

30:07.741 --> 30:17.453
moved back.

30:18.434 --> 30:28.727
Invariably, because we were a

30:18.434 --> 30:28.727
separate army unit, we got the least desirable

30:32.099 --> 30:49.320
Of course, they give a division the first 
priority, and he takes the biggest town to his

30:32.099 --> 30:49.320
division headquarters, and your separate 
troops, or meaning the Army Artillery Battalion

30:32.099 --> 30:49.320
sitting out here, and the squeeze of a big goose 
egg, if that's a good way to put it. And we may have a

30:50.402 --> 30:54.427
little settlement, or we may not. We've had leased 
accommodations and a leased of facilities. off of

31:01.782 --> 31:04.545
the land. And the little towns that we were 
invariably put in, and I guess we got in some towns

31:06.207 --> 31:13.256
of 5,000 people, you know. But Germany was made up 
of very small towns, basically, little farming

31:14.517 --> 31:21.966
community towns. Those people fell back with 
their troops or fled in front of their troops,

31:22.006 --> 31:31.097
except for this one or two old men or old woman and an 
old man or a husband or a boyfriend or something. A

31:34.593 --> 31:39.718
lot of them put their cattle and all up in the attic. 
And he was left there to feed and water the cattle,

31:40.959 --> 31:51.107
thinking eventually, and they believed, that the 
Americans would be driven out and they'd come back

31:40.959 --> 31:51.107
to their homes. And we didn't have any dealings 
with them except as conquerors. Was there a lot of

32:01.604 --> 32:02.625
hatred? I beg your pardon? Was there a lot of 
hatred? No, no, no. You didn't see any. I didn't

32:11.033 --> 32:13.235
experience any of that at all. For instance,

32:14.036 --> 32:25.748
I picked up a Telefunken TV out of a bombed out house 
or shot up house. The part of it was still intact. A

32:28.170 --> 32:28.270
TV? I don't mean TV, a radio. Sure, a telephone 
radio. And of course it had shortwave on it. And I

32:37.986 --> 32:44.355
could in turn tune in to Axis Annie and Berlin and 
all on it. And I just, when we moved out of this

32:44.455 --> 32:47.520
little house, I just took it with me. Well, sooner 
or later I plugged it in to a German 220 volt line.

32:56.453 --> 32:58.155
The Germans have got five or six different kind of 
electricity in every town. Got 110, 60 cycle, and

33:02.252 --> 33:19.770
110, 100 cycle, 220 DC and AC, 60 cycle, and you plug 
in, you test it on the wrong plug wire, boom, she

33:02.252 --> 33:19.770
gone. But anyway, I blew out a fuse on the radio. And 
I went to little old, We'd call it

33:28.612 --> 33:34.518
a... Repairman? No, no, no. General Mercantile 
Store in Old Town. You know, he carries oil and he

33:39.282 --> 33:47.250
carries groceries and he carries bicycle parts 
and buggy parts. And I'm sure he carried a few

33:47.270 --> 33:54.377
radios because at one time he didn't have any when I 
went in there. But he had a Telefunken sign out on

33:54.818 --> 33:57.100
his on his window glass. They got Coca-Cola signs 
and Maytag washing machine signs and telephone

34:00.437 --> 34:09.686
signs. And I went in there and had this little fuse 
about this long, about half as big around as a

34:10.607 --> 34:18.214
pencil. And I went in and showed it to the lady. She 
came hobbling out. showed it to her and held my hand

34:25.970 --> 34:41.346
and she looked at it, wee, wee, and she went and got 
one somewhere and came back and I tried to pay her in

34:25.970 --> 34:41.346
American script, that's all the money I had, 
American GI money, they paid us in script. And she

34:42.287 --> 34:43.188
wouldn't take it.

34:46.812 --> 34:48.374
She just wouldn't take the money at all. So. There 
wasn't much hatred then? No, no, there wasn't any

34:53.579 --> 34:55.521
hatred. They wanted to incur the good favor of the 
Americans because they had been told that we were

34:55.838 --> 35:06.274
an atrocious army and to hate us. But that didn't 
hold water and got to dealing with them.

35:15.529 --> 35:21.698
Down in Austria, for instance,

35:15.529 --> 35:21.698
I took over an area. And of course, I went. and made 
my acquaintance with the burgomaster, so you got

35:24.475 --> 35:28.080
in a little town. And I befriended him. He had some 
truck there that he'd used in the city business,

35:30.603 --> 35:40.515
and they didn't have any diesel. And I gave him a 
drum of diesel

35:41.476 --> 35:52.390
to do his burgomaster business.

35:55.728 --> 36:00.914
He took me hunting. Took me chamois hunting, you 
know. What kind of hunting? Chamois. What are

36:06.020 --> 36:06.541
those? Oh, they are antelope type of animals. You 
know what a chamois skin is. Yeah, right. Well,

36:11.126 --> 36:14.951
he's an antelope. They only grow in the Alps, the 
Swiss and the Bavarian Alps. He ranges up just

36:21.398 --> 36:24.762
below the snow line, high altitude. Did you get 
one? Yeah, I got a nice one. And, of course, I made a

36:27.500 --> 36:35.551
nice shot on him, and that word got out, you know. 
But I

36:35.571 --> 36:47.428
helped him and, in turn, helped myself because I 
was the civilian authority over this area. And I

36:48.028 --> 36:48.569
used him. And I just told him what I wanted done and 
how we clamped him. a curfew on down, and I expected

36:54.892 --> 36:58.055
him to keep it. Okay, now this is when you were Chief 
of Public Works in the Utility Office? No, that's

37:01.719 --> 37:03.441
before I got there. Oh, okay, so you're right now. 
That's when I was leaving the 745

37:05.584 --> 37:12.751
F.A. Battalion at the end of the war, just at the end 
of the war, and we got moved down to Holtheim.

37:25.182 --> 37:37.738
Austria, and theoretically, preparing to

37:25.182 --> 37:37.738
go into an invasion of the Japanese islands. We 
completely re-equip, we star gauge an artillery

37:40.221 --> 37:53.097
piece, which is internally measuring the lands, 
which are the grooves in the rifle. And if they

37:53.768 --> 37:56.652
weren't so far away, you'd get a new barrel, see. 
And we had stargazed our equipment, and that's a

37:57.573 --> 38:00.557
chore. We'd gotten some new guns in. We'd gotten 
rid of all of our high point people, meaning people

38:04.181 --> 38:11.391
that had so many months of service in combat. And 
those people that had gotten hurt, they got so many

38:12.352 --> 38:21.143
points for getting hurt, and they got so many 
points for being promoted, and they got so many

38:12.352 --> 38:21.143
points for a month, and that kind of thing. And we 
got rid of all the high point people and got in all

38:22.625 --> 38:30.112
new low point men and officers. And we were 
supposed to, well, we actually had shipped our

38:30.132 --> 38:34.936
equipment to Marseilles. Our train was there 
waiting, noticed that a boat was waiting on us, and

38:36.317 --> 38:48.368
they'd ship you to the ports because they didn't 
want you overcrowding the ports. And our train was

38:50.670 --> 38:52.412
there, and I'd fix them or my people had fixed up my 
caboose. Boy, it was a luxurious penthouse. They

38:59.376 --> 39:03.800
moved in some beds in there for me and my exec. And it 
was fixed up. And

39:07.923 --> 39:16.050
the J Day caught us in this transition. So we 
immediately knew that we weren't going. And I'd

39:18.753 --> 39:22.416
been given the top secret information. to the Far 
East for the invasion of the Japanese islands,

39:24.353 --> 39:28.978
home islands. And so,

39:28.998 --> 39:53.803
when I got the top secret word on that deal, of 
course, at the exact moment, I called my staff

39:28.998 --> 39:53.803
together and told them, read the order, that V-J 
Day was such and such a time, and we could

39:28.998 --> 39:53.803
celebrate, so we celebrated. We had a good one. We 
picked up a bunch of cases of champagne and we

39:56.110 --> 40:01.655
celebrated with champagne. Every man in my 
battalion got a bottle of champagne, free. And

40:08.482 --> 40:10.024
every officer got all he could drink. I'm sure some 
of the men got more of it because we had some

40:12.366 --> 40:17.452
leftover. But we celebrated VJ Day in all-time 
Austria. And it was very few days after that I got

40:23.247 --> 40:29.193
transferred from the 745 F.A. Battalion to U.S. 
Forces in Austria, which were in Vienna.

40:37.140 --> 40:47.571
And there's where I

40:37.140 --> 40:47.571
got into real staff work, working for General 
Clark, Mark Clark. Oh, really? What kind of man was

40:48.451 --> 40:49.312
he? He was a very fine person. He was a strictly 
administrator.

40:56.052 --> 41:00.338
I have no idea about his combat capabilities 
because I didn't see him combat. He was a

41:00.939 --> 41:02.741
tremendous administrator.

41:06.186 --> 41:06.887
It's 5 o'clock. How long do you want to stay here? 
Well,

41:09.150 --> 41:18.062
why don't you just answer that question about 
General Clark and then we'll go and we'll start off

41:09.150 --> 41:18.062
tomorrow. All right. I worked for him for, well, 
five months. Mm-hmm. and I was in several

41:27.271 --> 41:32.239
conferences. He was the CG of U.S. force in Austria 
and he had a general, Major General Brand as his

41:33.080 --> 41:43.616
exec and a Major General Salzman who was my boss. I 
was the,

41:45.859 --> 41:55.995
they called it, the public utility officer. I was 
an engineer and set up an engineering section. And

42:06.312 --> 42:20.910
General Clark either realized or was told to 
reestablish the communication systems, meaning

42:06.312 --> 42:20.910
the power and telephone and trains and all. The 
power lines are like our power poles. They carry

42:23.414 --> 42:26.117
telephones and juice. Now, Austria runs on 
electricity. Basically, it's an electrified

42:33.533 --> 42:36.196
country. They have power stations, both hydro and 
coal-fired. Had some oil-fired, but they didn't

42:45.264 --> 42:48.347
have any oil in those days. It was all coal-fired 
generation stations. And our job was to get those

42:52.671 --> 42:54.973
stations back Working order. Working order, and 
the transmission lines in working order so that

42:57.441 --> 43:06.094
they could pipe juice to all these towns and to 
their industry. Because General Eisenhower or

43:06.114 --> 43:16.329
maybe Mr. Truman recognized

43:06.114 --> 43:16.329
that they had to get those people back to working. 
Sure, really. And forget their problems and get

43:18.292 --> 43:21.777
them to doing something, to working again. And so 
my job, General Brand took and General Solomon

43:27.151 --> 43:42.974
gave me my responsibility of checking the power 
stations in Austria to see if it was running, when

43:27.151 --> 43:42.974
we could get it running, and if not, why not.

43:43.635 --> 43:54.171
I was the American representative on a 
quadripartite level, meaning I was dealing with a

43:43.635 --> 43:54.171
British brigadier a French Brigadier, a Russian 
Major General, and myself a Lieutenant Colonel.

44:03.659 --> 44:25.170
And I was the key

44:03.659 --> 44:25.170
man in that group because we had the capabilities 
of transportation, telephone, radio, fuel, and

44:03.659 --> 44:25.170
all that, and those other people did not have it or 
didn't want to give it up for this chore. Let's talk

44:25.555 --> 44:27.710
about that first thing tomorrow. All right.
