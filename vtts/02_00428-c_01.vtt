WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:14.407
Then I was in that Director of Combat Developments 
for the remainder of my time in Doctrine, for the

00:03.355 --> 00:14.407
remainder of my time at Fort Sill. Actually, the 
title changed because that directorate went from

00:16.389 --> 00:28.602
under the new Combat Developments Command at Fort 
Belvoir, Virginia, but it was the same job. The

00:29.823 --> 00:30.544
name changed. The function and my job remained the 
same. And what did you do as the director? Our

00:37.987 --> 01:00.582
mission in the Office of Combat Developments and 
Doctrine, and later the Combat Developments

00:37.987 --> 01:00.582
Command, it was called, Field Artillery, we were 
to develop the doctrine and material

00:37.987 --> 01:00.582
requirements for the future, for the Field 
Artillery. In other words, we would ask ourselves

01:01.237 --> 01:19.103
the question, how should the field artillery be 
organized, how should it be equipped, and how

01:01.237 --> 01:19.103
should it fight in the future? And I'll tell you, 
that's a very great challenge to take those

01:21.426 --> 01:27.255
questions and work them. And it was one of the most 
interesting jobs that I that I ever had. Now, later

01:31.375 --> 01:51.476
on in my career as a general officer, I was deputy 
commander of the Combat Development Command near

01:31.375 --> 01:51.476
Washington, looking at that total picture and 
looking back at some of the work we did down there

01:31.375 --> 01:51.476
seven years before, six or seven years before. And 
that was an interesting experience, too, to be

01:52.357 --> 01:56.742
able to go from the basic organization and 
developments up to the top and look at it from both

01:58.747 --> 02:04.712
ends. How many did you have on the staff helping you 
with this with this chore? At Fort Selle? Yeah. 30

02:10.057 --> 02:23.310
some odd officers with the supporting non-coms 
and civilian people 30 odd I forget just how many it

02:10.057 --> 02:23.310
was pretty sizable organization. And what would 
you do sort of sit down and have seminars on

02:23.330 --> 02:27.133
particular Well, of course, we worked hand in 
glove with the field artillery school,

02:28.362 --> 02:38.056
particularly on doctrine, because they're 
teaching doctrine, and we were going to develop

02:28.362 --> 02:38.056
new doctrine. In other words, when you get new 
capabilities, you have to have new ways of doing

02:38.076 --> 02:45.367
things, and that becomes the doctrine. Now, the 
material side of it really is harder, I mean

02:46.008 --> 02:54.340
simpler, than the doctrine side of it. You kind of 
sometimes get into the question of the chicken and

02:54.360 --> 02:57.745
the egg, One, when you ask how should we be 
equipped, maybe you'd like to know how do we want to

02:58.788 --> 03:10.822
operate or accomplish, and then decide how to 
equip. Or you let the other approach, and it

03:11.062 --> 03:13.965
varies. The state of the art will permit us now to 
have, let's say, a cannon or an artillery weapon

03:15.707 --> 03:24.558
and shoot 75 miles. Well, up to now, 20 miles has 
been the number. Okay, what Should we take

03:29.737 --> 03:33.222
advantage of this state of the art? If so, what 
would we use that weapon for? And how, then, should

03:35.124 --> 03:38.548
we involve a doctrine for its use? What should be 
the doctrine for its use? I just gave you an

03:41.833 --> 03:43.034
example. One of the things that we tied into was 
taking advantage of computers to do the fire

03:44.156 --> 03:53.748
direction, fire data computing for the field 
artillery weapons. And we initiated that there.

04:00.702 --> 04:02.605
As I say, it was slow to come to fruition. We also, by 
the way, initiated the requirement which finally

04:02.645 --> 04:12.999
was approved for what is now known as the Lance 
Missile.

04:13.039 --> 04:14.822
We wrote the first piece of paper on it. That was too 
slow in being, it's just been recently been put in

04:16.384 --> 04:22.052
the category, in the inventory also. We're 
talking 20 years ago. And what was the difference

04:24.413 --> 04:35.082
between the Lance Missile and the other... Well, 
the Lance Missile was this weapon that would shoot

04:24.413 --> 04:35.082
20... We knew we could now shoot a 75-mile. We used 
to have the old Honest John rockets that shot about

04:35.102 --> 04:38.605
20.

04:41.648 --> 04:52.157
And our concept of the Lance Missile in the 
beginning was that it be primarily a nuclear

04:41.648 --> 04:52.157
weapon and it be A division weapon. The division 
commander, you have a unit in a division. And, of

04:58.460 --> 05:02.506
course, you could have some in corps. So that the 
division commander could influence the

05:02.526 --> 05:07.093
battlefield out to 75 miles. Well, the concept has 
been changed, not by the Army, but by the

05:09.596 --> 05:15.105
Department of Defense twice. It's no longer a 
division weapon. It's no longer primarily in a

05:19.892 --> 05:21.975
nuclear weapon. Really, it is dual capable, and we 
had it dual capable too. And the character of it

05:29.169 --> 05:34.257
changed at least twice that I know of. But at least 
that concept is now a reality. And what is it today?

05:39.486 --> 05:41.870
Today it's a core weapon only. In other words, the 
division commander will not have it. It will be

05:46.557 --> 05:50.123
controlled by the commander above him. That's 
why. Is the range still 75? I don't know what the

05:53.221 --> 05:57.006
specific range is, but I think it's basically the 
same. As a matter of fact, I think they increased

05:57.206 --> 05:58.888
it. I'm sure they did, as I recall. They increased 
it since I left the Army. That was another major

06:02.793 --> 06:03.975
change. Of course, when you increase that 
requirement for range, and they did that by making

06:03.995 --> 06:13.007
it a core weapon, then you change the, 
everything's got to be changed. The screws and the

06:13.027 --> 06:19.095
nuts and the bolts and the power unit and the 
guidance system and everything. And tactics

06:19.115 --> 06:20.076
also. So it's no wonder we go 20 years

06:20.427 --> 06:27.294
to get it on the field. Besides these two, the use of 
the computer and the Lance missile, were there

06:27.315 --> 06:34.342
other major advances that you people were working 
on? Oh, yes. We had,

06:34.983 --> 06:45.134
I think we should go to lunch, and then I'd like to 
discuss the most exciting, I think, of the era.

06:45.414 --> 06:46.395
What was that? But I will mention that we did have a 
new family of, field artillery cannon weapons

06:50.077 --> 06:59.087
that we were proposing, and most of those are in the 
inventory. But the exciting one I want to mention

06:59.408 --> 07:17.408
is the aerial artillery, the artillery to support 
the air assault division when the Army took to the

06:59.408 --> 07:17.408
air in helicopters, and I'd like to discuss that

06:59.408 --> 07:17.408
with you. Okay, can we read back some of that? Well, 
we were talking about four major advancements.

07:24.993 --> 07:30.778
The computer, the lance missile, the field 
artillery cannons, and the air artillery. Oh,

07:31.159 --> 07:32.140
yeah. I wanted to get into that. Yeah, you were 
going to talk about the field artillery and the air

07:33.401 --> 07:36.904
artillery. Yes, I wanted to get into that aerial 
artillery and just mention before I do that, of

07:39.085 --> 07:49.294
course, one of our important areas of The shoot, 
move, and communicate was communications and, of

07:49.983 --> 07:58.811
course, mobility. And we did also state the 
requirements for, and we now have in the field, the

08:00.693 --> 08:11.824
field radios that we envisioned then for field 
artillery. A number of the weapons were

08:13.365 --> 08:18.150
self-propelled and therefore self-mobile. But 
the newest concept in mobility, moving, was the

08:19.160 --> 08:25.309
helicopter. You know, the helicopter had proven 
very useful in Korea, basically as an evacuation

08:25.329 --> 08:32.899
vehicle. But we made great strides with the 
helicopter, and we had some very fine ones. And so

08:37.406 --> 08:47.580
we conceived of an artillery unit equipped with 
rockets mounted on helicopters. And we developed

08:49.940 --> 08:57.670
an organization and equipment list for that and 
submitted it to higher headquarters.

09:00.454 --> 09:16.234
And they didn't act upon that because 
coincidentally, I think,

09:00.454 --> 09:16.234
they just sent it back saying that the Army's 
created a new board called the Air Mobility Board.

09:17.041 --> 09:23.633
to investigate the use of helicopters across the 
board and other aircraft by the Army in general.

09:25.156 --> 09:29.925
And so your recommendation returned for 
consideration in that process. This started in

09:31.668 --> 09:36.737
19, that was 1962.

09:39.552 --> 09:52.946
Actually, this board convened, it became known as 
the House Board, it's a rather famous board,

09:39.552 --> 09:52.946
because it did result in a sort of a revolutionary 
doctrine

09:39.552 --> 09:52.946
for the use of aircraft for the Army. How's 
H-O-U-S-E? H-O-W-Z-E.

09:54.808 --> 10:07.821
And I was fortunate enough to have been a member of 
that board, and I took that little package, but of

09:54.808 --> 10:07.821
course what we dealt with was much larger. But in 
the end of the actions, we did wind up with such a

10:08.493 --> 10:11.517
unit.

10:14.780 --> 10:31.560
We did wind up also with recommendations for a 
division and separate units that were oriented

10:14.780 --> 10:31.560
toward the use, equipped to use helicopters and to 
take maximum advantage of air mobility. You know,

10:31.580 --> 10:38.348
when you introduce, it's a funny thing, as we go 
along in the developments of capabilities for

10:31.580 --> 10:38.348
war, Occasionally there's a significant jump, 
like the nuclear weapon, for example, and

10:39.425 --> 10:46.913
firepower.

10:49.636 --> 10:58.265
Mobility, we felt, could be influenced 
dramatically by intelligent use of helicopters.

10:59.106 --> 11:06.934
So we wound up basically with a division equipped 
with these and the units within the division,

10:59.106 --> 11:06.934
which included the artillery. battalion of these 
rocket helicopter unit, helicopter outfit. And

11:14.521 --> 11:21.468
then we had direct support units with the regular 
cannon, but their mobility was provided with a

11:14.521 --> 11:21.468
larger helicopter.

11:24.812 --> 11:28.156
This then became, it was approved by the Secretary 
of Defense. He's the one who directed this study we

11:28.176 --> 11:30.118
made. Great. And Mr. McNamara had approved this 
for testing. I left Fort Sill to go to this trial

11:37.846 --> 12:06.688
division which was then called the 11th Air 
Assault Division

11:37.846 --> 12:06.688
and was one of those I think fortunate people who 
had the opportunity to be with it to get it

11:37.846 --> 12:06.688
organized and trained and tested and the final 
test well before approval came in the Carolinas on

11:37.846 --> 12:06.688
maneuvers and And when was that? That was in 
October, November of 63. Okay. No, 64. Okay. 64.

12:16.524 --> 12:25.774
And Mr. McNamara approved the organization that 
basically we tested there, which included this

12:16.524 --> 12:25.774
division and other units. And tell me what 
equipment you had in that division. Well, we had,

12:28.757 --> 12:34.583
I'd like to mention that, after we get them in 
Vietnam because the final approval within some,

12:34.917 --> 12:53.183
not too many months after approval of these 
organizations, President Johnson decided to go

12:34.917 --> 12:53.183
into Vietnam in strength and we were alerted to go. 
We were the first full division to go. Now there

12:54.906 --> 12:59.933
were a couple of brigade combat teams that went 
over in advance of us. We had, as a result of these

13:05.562 --> 13:10.786
studies, tests, we were deployed with roughly 450 
aircraft.

13:13.409 --> 13:14.850
Most of those were helicopters. What type? We had 
what's called the Huey, which was the workhorse,

13:16.671 --> 13:23.737
basic troop carrier. It's also, that's it. It was 
also the vehicle that we hung these rockets on. It

13:29.742 --> 13:35.367
was also the vehicle that basically carried the 
reconnaissance elements in there weaponry. Then

13:38.490 --> 13:46.798
we had the little H-13 helicopter, it's a little 
two-seated helicopter which was used for light

13:38.490 --> 13:46.798
reconnaissance and observation. Then we had the 
heavy, heavier medium, it's a medium helicopter,

13:47.899 --> 14:06.417
CH-47, which lifted the artillery and we 
developed means for moving, no that's still the

13:47.899 --> 14:06.417
Huey, like we could move an artillery piece its 
ammunition and its crew in one of those but

14:06.802 --> 14:34.986
actually we would sling the weapon and the 
ammunition under it and the reason we did that was

14:06.802 --> 14:34.986
because it was much quicker than loading it in the 
aircraft and out and the reason you wanted to be

14:06.802 --> 14:34.986
very quick is when you unloaded and then you know 
where you were vulnerable vulnerable to enemy

14:06.802 --> 14:34.986
action you wanted to get it off and get that 
aircraft out as fast as possible and we had in the

14:37.008 --> 15:04.838
division a

14:37.008 --> 15:04.838
troop of

14:37.008 --> 15:04.838
twin engine reconnaissance aircraft

14:37.008 --> 15:04.838
and initially we had a squadron or battalion of 
light transport aircraft

14:37.008 --> 15:04.838
fixed wing those were later determined to be an Air 
Force mission and we turned them over to an Air

15:06.455 --> 15:35.736
Force unit and they supported us but anyway all 
this added up gave us tremendous capability to do

15:06.455 --> 15:35.736
our all the functions on the battlefield well what 
it sounds like to me and correct me if I'm wrong is

15:06.455 --> 15:35.736
that what you did in 1961 and 1962 was basically 
change the function of the helicopter to a combat

15:06.455 --> 15:35.736
aircraft I'm just sort of a surprise. That's true. 
From 62 and 3 and 4, yes. That's absolutely true. So

15:42.045 --> 15:47.552
you were right in the forefront of this combat use 
of the helicopter. I was among those few that

15:47.572 --> 15:51.937
really went through all phases of this. There were 
a lot involved at some phase or another, yes.

15:55.682 --> 15:56.142
That's true. And, of course, the helicopter had 
been looked upon up until then as a transport

15:56.243 --> 16:02.230
aircraft and an evacuation aircraft. But there's 
a lot of difference between moving in a helicopter

16:02.868 --> 16:11.084
or a group of a bunch of helicopters and 
maneuvering in them. And of course, we could get

16:11.104 --> 16:13.969
into any amount of detail on that aspect of it. But 
suffice it to say that

16:16.113 --> 16:25.872
we were equipped to perform really all functions 
of combat with aircraft. although we did have

16:26.476 --> 16:56.280
units with vehicles so that you know we could carry 
the heavy loads and catch up and build up but we

16:26.476 --> 16:56.280
could go into a combat situation relying entirely 
on aircraft initially and then when you in June of

16:26.476 --> 16:56.280
1964 when you became the commanding officer of the 
11th air assault division artillery you were the

16:26.476 --> 16:56.280
first division to use helicopters in this sense 
that's that's right we were the first to have them

16:26.476 --> 16:56.280
organized You were the first helicopter 
division. Yes, we were the first, that's right, in

17:01.009 --> 17:04.992
the first air assault division. That's 
fantastic. The first division to have anything

17:06.233 --> 17:09.476
like that organization. Who was your commanding 
general? The commanding general was General H.W.

17:13.860 --> 17:26.672
O'Conard who was a brilliant thinker,

17:13.860 --> 17:26.672
tactician,

17:13.860 --> 17:26.672
leader. and I consider myself very fortunate to 
have been associated with him. You recall in the

17:34.554 --> 17:43.261
Battle of the Bulge when General McCulloch 
answered the German demand for surrender by

17:34.554 --> 17:43.261
saying nuts? The story is that Harry Cunard was the 
G3 of that time and he's actually the one who said

17:43.281 --> 17:48.686
send this message.

17:54.131 --> 17:56.473
But he did a brilliant job there and later after we 
came both came back from vietnam he left the

17:57.061 --> 18:25.482
division before i did uh he was appointed 
commander of the combat developments command

17:57.061 --> 18:25.482
near washington there because of his great 
capacity for thinking into guiding new ideas and

17:57.061 --> 18:25.482
then when i came back after a while after i got back 
oh after about a year i was assigned as his deputy in

17:57.061 --> 18:25.482
that command he's a deputy commander. Well this is 
really a great change then for the use of

18:27.284 --> 18:38.558
helicopters and this is probably a great honor for 
you wasn't it to be to be the uh commanding officer

18:27.284 --> 18:38.558
of of that division? Well I was commanding officer 
of the division artillery. Right yeah and how many

18:41.602 --> 18:45.327
how many other divisions? You see sure how many 
other colonels were there? Oh there were there

18:48.230 --> 18:53.697
were quite a number you see that division 
consisted of three brigades a division artillery

18:55.027 --> 19:12.847
all commanded by colonels, an aviation group 
commanded by a colonel, and then there were other

18:55.027 --> 19:12.847
separate units of battalion size commanded by 
lieutenant colonels, and then of course the

18:55.027 --> 19:12.847
subordinate units of those majors won. So there 
were three generals and I guess six colonels in

19:13.008 --> 19:21.337
that division, five colonels in that division. So 
you were right in the forefront then. I happen to

19:23.731 --> 19:30.721
be, that's one of those matters of being in the 
right place at the right time for advantage. The

19:30.741 --> 19:35.087
advantage being that I was in the most interesting 
outfit to come down the pike since I'd been in the

19:30.741 --> 19:35.087
Army. And when we went to Vietnam, we couldn't have 
come close to doing what we did in Vietnam without

19:37.370 --> 19:45.641
that capability. We were freed from the terrain. 
That's the main thing, you see. Well, you went to

19:50.428 --> 19:53.552
Vietnam then in January of 1965. that's no in uh 
September of 65 isn't it January quarter assist oh

19:54.106 --> 20:18.426
it does okay well you were made assistant division 
commander in January of 65 then were you sent to

19:54.106 --> 20:18.426
Vietnam in September of 65 this

19:54.106 --> 20:18.426
should read uh 66

19:54.106 --> 20:18.426
we went to uh

20:21.528 --> 20:24.732
We went to Vietnam in September of 66. No, you're 
right, 65. In September of 65, and I was made

20:28.297 --> 20:33.063
assistant division commander in January of 66. So 
two months later, I moved from division artillery

20:33.103 --> 20:44.177
commander to assistant division commander and 
was nominated for promotion to brigadier

20:33.103 --> 20:44.177
general. There were two assistant division 
commanders, one assistant for logistics, I was

20:52.595 --> 21:22.011
the operations assistant well let's talk about 
Vietnam are we ready to talk about that okay good

20:52.595 --> 21:22.011
what were your feelings when when you got your 
orders to go to Vietnam to a new theater of combat

20:52.595 --> 21:22.011
well the uh I felt it was the thing to do because of 
course we've been following the situation and I

20:52.595 --> 21:22.011
guess this was no great surprise that we were going 
to the U.S. was going to send a major force into

21:22.868 --> 21:51.441
Vietnam it was a little bit of a surprise I guess 
that we were chosen to be the the ones to lead off

21:22.868 --> 21:51.441
well we really weren't the lead I've got to give 
credit to the first brigade of the 101st airborne

21:22.868 --> 21:51.441
division and of the 73rd separate brigade who went 
over being smaller lighter they got there before

21:22.868 --> 21:51.441
we did But nevertheless, I thought it was the right 
thing to do as an individual.

22:02.232 --> 22:15.607
I'd spent many years being a student of this 
communist effort that appeared to be aimed at

22:02.232 --> 22:15.607
taking over the world, and they'd have to take us 
over before they ever accomplished that. And I

22:16.528 --> 22:20.652
basically felt that the further away from home we 
could defeat their efforts, the better. And I'd

22:22.184 --> 22:30.452
rather see it defeated now in my time than to have my 
boys inherit the job, for example. And I felt it

22:31.593 --> 22:36.998
very essential that we keep it away from this 
hemisphere in any case. So I thought it was a

22:38.580 --> 22:43.965
logical decision. And so in other words, you were 
pretty eager to get in the combat. Yes, sir. I

22:47.088 --> 22:48.889
thought it was the right thing to do. OK. What were 
the conditions like when you landed? and where did

22:52.947 --> 22:53.728
you go? where were you stationed? we went into what 
was called the Highlands area okay two corps?

23:00.400 --> 23:19.191
third corps okay third corps and uh as you know 
Pleiku was the capital of that region and uh we went

23:00.400 --> 23:19.191
in our base camp was at Anke which was uh oh about 20 
miles inland from the uh China Sea there to go But we

23:21.213 --> 23:23.276
immediately started operating, of course. 
Initially, constructing the base and getting it

23:23.336 --> 23:35.934
in condition, we sent out one brigade at a time and 
operations, and eventually we got to the position

23:23.336 --> 23:35.934
where we had all three brigades out. The base 
became just a place like,

23:35.954 --> 23:46.509
you know, to store things and to have the support 
troops that aren't needed up front. And

23:46.529 --> 23:47.330
communications. And communications. Many 
people have the idea that we all fought out of

23:49.394 --> 23:53.259
permanent bases out there. That's not true. We had 
permanent bases, and we fought where it was

23:54.161 --> 24:02.392
demanded, and we weren't directly tied to those 
bases at all. But when we first got there, of

24:02.412 --> 24:18.675
course, we had one brigade in that area, the 1st 
Airborne Division, one U.S. brigade, and there

24:02.412 --> 24:18.675
were, as I recall, initially three Vietnamese 
divisions in that area. three or four and they've

24:19.837 --> 24:49.506
been a great threat that the North Vietnamese were 
going to take this area and so that's one reason we

24:19.837 --> 24:49.506
went rather hurriedly to get into this fight

24:19.837 --> 24:49.506
and tell you the truth that first I was there a year 
and a half in that first period

24:19.837 --> 24:49.506
there was plenty of enemy to be found and fought. 
And I'm talking about North Vietnamese

24:52.752 --> 24:57.138
divisions. And there was also a couple of Viet Cong 
regiments, uniformed regiments,

24:57.158 --> 25:05.229
in the area. And the Viet Cong guerrilla really 
didn't figure significantly in our operations

25:05.249 --> 25:13.039
for that year and a half I was in the division. 
Mostly it was against the North Vietnamese

25:13.059 --> 25:15.162
regulars. Mostly it was against the North 
Vietnamese regulars and their major Viet Cong How

25:19.777 --> 25:25.246
well did your helicopters work in combat? Very 
well. We didn't really have any serious problems

25:27.289 --> 25:32.518
other than one. We found in the dry season, it gets 
very dry. You know, they have the rainy season and

25:35.243 --> 25:38.508
the dry season. And when it gets very dry, the dust 
was a problem. And we had the same problem

25:48.413 --> 25:55.361
that the helicopter force in the raid on Tehran 
had. And we licked it. How'd you do it? Well,

25:57.704 --> 26:05.492
actually, the technical representatives of the 
Bell helicopter, I think, as I recall, were the

25:57.704 --> 26:05.492
main contributors. But basically, it was by 
putting shields so that the dust wouldn't get in

26:05.973 --> 26:10.078
there. The dust and dirt and grime. And so I was 
amazed that this happened helicopters in Iran

26:19.463 --> 26:27.573
after the experience, and they had I'm sure the 
same experience as the Marines in Vietnam. How

26:28.114 --> 26:31.919
well did the rockets work on the helicopters? They 
were very effective. The only major deficiency of

26:34.302 --> 26:43.073
the rockets were that they were not extremely 
accurate, so you had to be very careful not to hit

26:34.302 --> 26:43.073
our own people.

26:45.877 --> 26:48.621
How about the machine guns and the cannons? How'd 
they work? Oh, well, everything, we were well

26:49.315 --> 26:58.065
equipped, extremely well equipped, and for that 
war, we didn't have any counter battery

26:49.315 --> 26:58.065
requirements. We didn't have any enemy artillery 
to counter, and so we had quite adequate

26:58.085 --> 27:14.744
firepower, and we used firepower a lot because the 
American forces, I think, have always believed in

26:58.085 --> 27:14.744
using firepower instead of infantrymen's lives. 
There were some very interesting... things

27:19.235 --> 27:40.247
developed though from a standpoint of tactics 
with this new capability for

27:19.235 --> 27:40.247
example for the artillery which I was commanding 
initially there and the old doctrine you can place

27:19.235 --> 27:40.247
your artillery in defilade that means for example 
behind the hill And the basic purpose of that, to

27:41.746 --> 27:51.060
simplify it, the basic reason for that is to be 
masked from the enemy's artillery and

27:41.746 --> 27:51.060
observation. The principle is observation. 
Well, we used the tactic in Vietnam of placing the

27:56.588 --> 28:00.975
artillery on the mountaintops.

28:03.618 --> 28:10.048
And the reason for that was that we could get on the 
mountaintops with our helicopter just as easily

28:03.618 --> 28:10.048
as we could get in the valleys. But being on the 
mountaintops, we could protect ourselves

28:10.383 --> 28:20.432
without drawing off the troopers and the infantry 
to reinforce us while we were serving the

28:10.383 --> 28:20.432
artillery, you see, artillery pieces. And you 
could command the valley. And you could command

28:22.614 --> 28:23.715
the valley. That's just one aspect of it. Of 
course, in the larger sense, you generally

28:26.458 --> 28:38.449
consider that when you commit a division in 
combat, in the battle, and commit them to action,

28:39.813 --> 28:41.835
you will keep a healthy reserve. There's no rule of 
thumb, but any brigade commander would

28:43.596 --> 28:50.923
ordinarily keep at least a battalion in reserve. 
He may start his offensive with two in reserve.

28:54.486 --> 29:02.473
Similarly, at division level, a division 
commander would like to have a brigade in reserve

28:54.486 --> 29:02.473
or the elements of a brigade, equivalent 
elements. But with this air mobile capability,

29:04.014 --> 29:08.638
you really could consider any unit available to be 
used as a reinforcing force if he was not actually

29:10.660 --> 29:30.499
engaged with the enemy because you could go pick 
him up and maneuver him as a reserve, a

29:10.660 --> 29:30.499
counter-attacking forcing, a reinforcing 
force. And so we could commit really the vast

29:30.519 --> 29:38.187
majority of our combat battalions and companies 
without the danger of being too weak in reserve. So

29:46.011 --> 29:49.995
many of those operations were in the vast areas. It 
was very seldom that we had a majority of our

29:50.015 --> 29:58.243
battalions in contact with the enemy at any given 
time. So I think that gives some hint at the

29:58.263 --> 30:07.132
influence that this air mobility had on tactics. 
Did you go out on the maneuver? Or did you usually

30:10.263 --> 30:13.809
stay at the headquarters trying to direct and plan 
the maneuvers? The headquarters, as assistant

30:14.490 --> 30:36.827
division commander for operations, I was usually 
in my helicopter

30:14.490 --> 30:36.827
over the action or we'd have a light command post 
ahead, division command post on the ground, but

30:14.490 --> 30:36.827
I'd seldom get back to the base where the main 
division headquarters was. But that helicopter

30:39.338 --> 30:45.524
allowed us not only to keep in contact by radio, but 
you could actually see what was going on. And that

30:45.704 --> 30:55.532
was a great advantage if

30:45.704 --> 30:55.532
that higher authority didn't interfere with the 
subordinates' business. I always believed in

30:55.853 --> 31:07.303
giving the

30:55.853 --> 31:07.303
brigade commanders their, letting them make 
their plan, get their plan approved, their order

31:08.313 --> 31:10.956
and resources do it and let them do it. But it was a 
great temptation because a commander, division

31:12.999 --> 31:25.694
commander, assistant division commander, 
brigade commander, could actually be with the

31:12.999 --> 31:25.694
operation in the air, see what's going on in many 
cases. Of course, in the jungles you can't see that

31:25.915 --> 31:27.837
well. And there was a temptation on the part, to 
some anyway, to therefore become involved more

31:29.259 --> 31:35.907
directly

31:41.489 --> 31:43.872
I tried very religiously not to do that. I always 
felt that we had commanders entirely competent,

31:44.813 --> 31:57.989
not more competent to conduct that battle on the 
ground, certainly as competent, and after all

31:44.813 --> 31:57.989
you've got to leave the authority where the 
responsibility is. Sure, right there. But the air

32:00.753 --> 32:10.585
mobility

32:00.753 --> 32:10.585
allowed us to do many of these functions of combat, 
tactical, logistical, the intelligence and

32:11.628 --> 32:39.289
reconnaissance functions in different ways new 
ways that weren't possible before for example

32:11.628 --> 32:39.289
one day we got orders we were operating around 
Pleiku got order from our higher commander which

32:11.628 --> 32:39.289
was the equivalent of a corps commander

32:11.628 --> 32:39.289
to move a brigade near to an area near Nha Trang, 
which was about 200, as I recall, about 200

32:39.488 --> 33:02.627
kilometers away from where we were,

32:39.488 --> 33:02.627
immediately to reinforce a battalion of ours that 
had become heavily engaged with a large enemy

32:39.488 --> 33:02.627
force and which that immediately reinforced.

33:13.913 --> 33:35.947
As I recall we got that instruction about 10 
o'clock in the morning and before sundown that

33:13.913 --> 33:35.947
afternoon we were 200 miles away with the assault 
elements of a brigade in contact with the enemy

33:13.913 --> 33:35.947
relieving the commander who was under fire. 
That's fantastic. and then by nightfall those

33:38.720 --> 34:05.031
caribou transport aircraft were landing one 
after the other with supplies and ammunition and

33:38.720 --> 34:05.031
we had that brigade closed before midnight and a 
full brigade on the ground fighting before the

33:38.720 --> 34:05.031
next sunrise with its necessary support elements 
there which is fantastic

34:07.660 --> 34:09.021
And we did that sort of thing. We had the capability 
to do that sort of thing. That was sort of an

34:10.683 --> 34:12.705
emergency situation. And if you choose the way you 
do things, you can do them a little more calmly and a

34:13.226 --> 34:20.473
little more detailed planning, but it can be done. 
It can be done very successfully. We always felt

34:23.076 --> 34:34.427
that even if the entire division was

34:23.076 --> 34:34.427
operating three brigades and we needed to make a 
significant tactical reach we could get a brigade

34:36.398 --> 35:01.849
another 25 kilometers out and continue complete 
support because we had that ability to move and

34:36.398 --> 35:01.849
resupply with air and you didn't have to have a road 
to get there that's for sure now when you were in the

34:36.398 --> 35:01.849
air I suppose you were shot at quite a bit weren't 
you Was your helicopter hit? Oh, we were often

35:05.023 --> 35:07.346
shot, and occasionally we got hit.

35:11.392 --> 35:12.113
I never was hit. The nearest, there was a hole shot 
right next to me in the door of my helicopter, and I

35:14.096 --> 35:23.649
got a little prick, but I didn't consider that a 
wound. But nevertheless, this was commonplace,

35:23.969 --> 35:25.852
of course. I remember seeing one of our battalion 
commanders land, and I landed behind him. We were

35:31.079 --> 35:31.600
going to got together for a chat, and he had 
30-some-odd bullet holes in his helicopter, and

35:32.913 --> 35:42.203
he was still flying. My goodness. I recall very 
well. You know, the greatest difficulty

35:45.527 --> 36:00.124
encountered in selling the concept of this 
helicopter, basically helicopter-equipped

35:45.527 --> 36:00.124
division, equipped for mobility, was its 
vulnerability to anti-aircraft. And, of

36:00.244 --> 36:01.245
course... Selling it to the Pentagon, you mean? 
Yeah, so for a decision in the Pentagon and toward

36:02.461 --> 36:15.619
the other senior army people up through the 
channels,

36:02.461 --> 36:15.619
a helicopter is a Baltimore machine. And when 
you're taking the helicopter right down to the

36:16.941 --> 36:26.595
ground to discharge troops, for example, a .45 
pistol is a pretty good anti-aircraft weapon.

36:26.735 --> 36:27.676
Certainly a rifle is. Certainly a machine gun is. 
You don't have to have the sophisticated missiles

36:31.385 --> 36:50.997
and everything but many people in looking at this 
vulnerability question

36:31.385 --> 36:50.997
lose sight of the what is the synergenics we call it 
of the situation where you've got support of all

36:31.385 --> 36:50.997
kinds of this group of helicopters we're going to 
assume we're going to put into an area. You've got

36:56.359 --> 36:57.581
fire support. You've got reconnaissance ahead of 
them to see where the enemy is and to watch to see

36:57.701 --> 37:02.809
that he doesn't come in. You've got the surprise 
effect of the tactics of coming along just at the

37:02.869 --> 37:15.790
treetops, and strangely enough, you won't hear 
that helicopter until he's right on you. You won't

37:16.872 --> 37:18.655
hear a group of them until he's right there. and 
then all of a sudden swim you're down on the air

37:19.462 --> 37:46.853
you've selected to land your troops on and you're 
away and so we're not nearly as vulnerable as you'd

37:19.462 --> 37:46.853
think and you say well you didn't have those big 
anti-aircraft guns and missiles there well

37:19.462 --> 37:46.853
that's true the enemy did bring in the uh 20 
millimeter anti-aircraft and some of their

37:19.462 --> 37:46.853
anti-aircraft weapons later on they gave us more 
trouble that was after I left But we tested against

37:47.575 --> 37:56.005
our own Hawk missile and we could fly under their 
radar and we could actually destroy them before

37:47.575 --> 37:56.005
they could get a shot off of them according to those 
experiments. Anyway, it works. I think it would

38:00.751 --> 38:01.973
work in Europe. I'm absolutely convinced that 
every Corps commander in Europe should have one of

38:02.313 --> 38:13.708
these divisions or at least a brigade with those 
capabilities of the Air Assault Division in his

38:02.313 --> 38:13.708
force. They're great for reconnaissance. 
They're great to for flanking operations.

38:20.150 --> 38:23.274
They're great for delaying operations. They're 
just great for any raid that requires surprise,

38:23.754 --> 38:28.681
swiftness, and reach. But in Vietnam, I recall at 
the time I left, we kept pretty careful check and

38:30.263 --> 38:41.437
records of the aircraft losses, of course, and 
even the hits. Those were reported data, just like

38:42.318 --> 38:45.262
casualties. So many hits, So many aircraft 
knocked down, so many aircraft lost, if lost.

38:55.962 --> 39:05.877
One of the beautiful things about a helicopter is 
that you can disable the engine, but you can still

38:55.962 --> 39:05.877
get down safely by auto rotation, it's called. It 
takes a good pilot, of course, to do that. We had

39:10.223 --> 39:11.425
splendid pilots. But as I recall,

39:13.548 --> 39:18.315
we had a hit. for every 750 sorties on the average 
for the year and a half I was there. And it doesn't

39:28.943 --> 39:36.071
take many hours to fly 750 sorties with 450 
aircraft. We had an aircraft downed every- these

39:37.512 --> 39:44.640
750s hang together- every

39:47.540 --> 40:15.657
2,750 sorties

39:47.540 --> 40:15.657
and we had an aircraft lost every 27,500 sorties by 
means lost and once the helicopter down we usually

39:47.540 --> 40:15.657
if we landed it safely we usually recover it and 
repair it see well how does that so that's not too

39:47.540 --> 40:15.657
that's not too vulnerable oh that's pretty good 
those figures got worse of course when the enemy

39:47.540 --> 40:15.657
did bring in his anti-aircraft And how does that 
compare to other aircraft? I really can't tell you

40:22.053 --> 40:37.320
that but I know that these are startling 
statistics when you look back at the predictions

40:22.053 --> 40:37.320
that were made you know based on the suspected 
vulnerability of these aircraft. Okay you've

40:37.340 --> 40:40.446
listed a lot of the benefits of using the 
helicopters what were your main problems in

40:41.084 --> 41:10.669
Vietnam besides the fact that you'd get hit like 
any other aircraft

40:41.084 --> 41:10.669
the main problems in Vietnam were very clear 
became very clear I uh was sent home on leave uh no

40:41.084 --> 41:10.669
this is I'm not talking just about I'm talking 
about with the use of the helicopter now we'll get

40:41.084 --> 41:10.669
to the problems of all Vietnam oh with the use of the 
helicopter well uh Your major problems, of

41:11.273 --> 41:14.136
course, were maintenance problems. Aircraft are 
sort of difficult to maintain in any case. Sure,

41:19.563 --> 41:21.224
absolutely. But you just have to rest them enough 
that you can get their prescribed maintenance in

41:21.365 --> 41:28.092
for them. And that's a very important thing for a 
commander to consider. The pilots can fly longer

41:33.739 --> 41:39.205
than the aircraft, really, when you consider it. 
over a period of days now we're talking about so

41:40.045 --> 42:09.867
that was one thing ensuring that we met the 
maintenance schedules and if we needed parts we

41:40.045 --> 42:09.867
often had to wait too long for parts it's just a 
terribly complex thing there's so many parts

41:40.045 --> 42:09.867
involved it's a very difficult thing to maintain a 
stock or have it in the next depot available to you

41:40.045 --> 42:09.867
what you need every day sure so we would often wind 
up with more helicopters on deadline waiting

42:10.015 --> 42:39.955
maintenance because of parts and therefore this 
creates a problem because it reduces your

42:10.015 --> 42:39.955
effective strength really if you don't have those 
aircraft so it's something we fought all the time

42:10.015 --> 42:39.955
and improved all the time and got better and I think 
we did a pretty good job a limitation of the

42:10.015 --> 42:39.955
helicopter course is its inability to be 
navigated in closed weather and We never really

42:40.340 --> 42:46.307
got into a serious situation, dangerous 
situation because of that. But I recall we had a

42:46.827 --> 43:01.284
very careful plan for a surprise assault on the 
Anlao Valley that was delayed for more than 24

42:46.827 --> 43:01.284
hours because of weather. And we lost our surprise 
and therefore lost our enemy who got out of the

43:02.305 --> 43:08.372
valley before we got there. we had a plan that we'd 
hoped would bottle him up in that valley and just

43:08.808 --> 43:18.961
destroy a major element of the North Vietnamese 
division there. That's an example of what it can

43:20.964 --> 43:24.068
cost you. But there weren't any insurmountable 
problems. It operated very, very well. Okay, then

43:32.279 --> 43:36.925
let's go on to some other issues in Vietnam. 
General Westmoreland said that the war was the

43:37.529 --> 43:44.800
most technologically fought war in the history of 
warfare. What other technological advances did

43:45.260 --> 43:50.007
you have that you thought were helpful? Well, 
there was one significant one

43:50.027 --> 43:58.199
that I should mention not with a problem. It's 
always a problem to get enough intelligence. Any

44:02.305 --> 44:04.829
battlefield commander wants more intelligence. 
Sure. And, of course, The North Vietnamese and

44:07.178 --> 44:15.108
Viet Cong, it was rather difficult, particularly 
the North Vietnamese, to get intelligence on

44:07.178 --> 44:15.108
them. That was timely. So I suppose that one of the 
technological capabilities that was most

44:18.191 --> 44:33.269
helpful was the electronic intelligence 
capability.

44:33.329 --> 44:35.532
Fulfilled a very, very important function. It 
never brings this intelligence to complete

44:35.815 --> 44:43.503
fruition, but it helped a great deal. I think the- 
What specifically in the electronics field?

44:47.146 --> 44:51.510
Well, I don't think we can get specific on that. 
It's basically getting information by

44:51.570 --> 44:56.135
electronic means. Alright. Would you cut that off 
for me? I hear something. Another technological

45:02.561 --> 45:04.523
area that of course the aircraft

45:05.026 --> 45:33.531
were a tremendous step forward and we were the only 
division initially that had these all these

45:05.026 --> 45:33.531
helicopters assigned organically in other words 
we had them for use every day but every division in

45:05.026 --> 45:33.531
Vietnam had helicopters made available to it sure 
from supporting units to do go and conduct

45:05.026 --> 45:33.531
operations and then the helicopter go back to the 
parent unit that's quite a different thing

45:05.026 --> 45:33.531
because they couldn't depend on them all the time.

45:39.865 --> 45:56.584
I would add to technological advances that the 
matter of the use of computers and allied

45:39.865 --> 45:56.584
equipment, particularly in the logistics field, 
that was very significant. But, of course, I think

45:56.604 --> 45:59.788
what the statements that General Westmoreland 
made probably quite true, but we would expect the

46:01.355 --> 46:08.690
next time we go to war to be technologically even 
further advanced. That's a function of this

46:08.730 --> 46:12.417
technological revolution we're in. General 
Westmoreland, of course, was the Supreme

46:14.201 --> 46:19.431
American commander. Vietnam. What were your 
workings with him? How often did you see him? Well,

46:24.280 --> 46:27.444
we saw General Westmoreland at least once a week at 
our division. He came to that division and visited

46:27.464 --> 46:40.763
the troops and kept abreast of what we were 
accomplishing, what we had ahead of us, and we saw

46:27.464 --> 46:40.763
him often. What's your opinion of him? Can you 
describe him? Well, General Westmoreland, as you

46:45.409 --> 46:48.253
know, had been and was an outstanding man among his 
peers from the time
