00:14.510 --> 00:21.321
Today's interview is with Lester O'Bannon, 
retired professor of mechanical engineering at

00:14.510 --> 00:21.321
Texas A&M University. Professor O'Bannon, who is 
88, retired from A&M in 1964. Today's

00:26.630 --> 00:32.940
date is July 29, 1982. Let's begin, Professor 
O'Bannon, by your telling us something about your

00:33.581 --> 00:41.614
early years as a boy in Kentucky.

00:49.913 --> 00:57.121
First thing I remember was William McKinley 
getting shot when he was president. You were five

00:57.142 --> 00:58.323
years old at the time? I was about five or six years 
old. And I remember faintly the fact that the

01:02.728 --> 01:10.437
Spanish-American War was on about that time. When 
I was just a small child, I can recall seeing a

01:12.279 --> 01:18.807
neighbor man in uniform parading around, showing 
himself off in his front yard. And I guess that was

01:26.779 --> 01:37.629
my very first impression of the Spanish-American 
War, because I didn't know anything about what was

01:26.779 --> 01:37.629
going on. You were born in May 1894 in Stanford, 
Kentucky. That's right, May 5th.

01:46.077 --> 01:47.258
We had the same birthday. Stanford, Kentucky. 
That's S-T-A-N-F-O-R-D. I don't know how much you

01:52.522 --> 01:54.366
want me to tell. How long you got to listen? How long 
it takes. Did you live most of all your boyhood

02:01.339 --> 02:05.266
years in Stanford, or did you move elsewhere? I 
lived there. My address was there until I

02:06.769 --> 02:11.558
graduated from college, and then I moved on from 
there. And you graduated from the University of

02:11.791 --> 02:14.954
Kentucky at Lexington in what year? In 1915. With a 
bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering? A

02:18.097 --> 02:19.919
degree of bachelor of mechanical engineering. It 
was not bachelor of science, but just bachelor of

02:20.800 --> 02:25.644
mechanical engineering, BME. That was the custom 
in those days. How did you get interested in

02:28.747 --> 02:31.069
engineering? I didn't. It was just always assumed 
from the very beginning that I was going to go to

02:33.111 --> 02:38.236
college and take engineering. Why?

02:41.896 --> 02:46.241
I was always told that I was going to take 
electrical engineering. My father was an MD. He

02:47.942 --> 02:53.288
was a country doctor, very popular physician in 
that community.

02:56.091 --> 03:03.659
But his hobby was, I would say, cabinet making and 
building. And the closest thing that he could

03:06.101 --> 03:11.447
think of to that was engineering. And I'd fooled 
around with some electrical equipment while I was

03:13.537 --> 03:20.047
still in grade school or early high school. And 
everybody assumed that I was going to be an

03:22.030 --> 03:25.556
electrical engineer. And I went to college for 
that purpose. But at the University of Kentucky in

03:29.422 --> 03:34.309
those days, there was no such thing as an 
Department of Electrical Engineering. There was

03:34.329 --> 03:41.080
only Department of Mechanical Engineering,

03:34.329 --> 03:41.080
in which electrical engineering courses were 
taught. And although a fellow could specialize in

03:44.750 --> 03:49.480
electrical engineering, he got his degree in 
mechanical engineering.

03:52.306 --> 03:55.633
There were other colleges there, such as mining, 
metallurgy, civil.

03:58.659 --> 04:02.427
But mechanical engineering at that time included 
electrical engineering.

04:11.519 --> 04:16.384
And I was asked to fill out a form indicating what 
branch of engineering I wanted to be in. There was a

04:17.545 --> 04:18.726
list of them there. And among that list was steam 
engineering. And I had sort of taken a fancy to one

04:25.013 --> 04:33.321
of the professors in the department who taught 
steam engineering. And for some reason that I

04:34.983 --> 04:40.108
can't explain, I just checked on that form, steam 
engineering. And sure enough, after graduating a

04:42.147 --> 05:01.370
few weeks, I got a letter from the dean, which was a 
copy of letter that he had written to the

04:42.147 --> 05:01.370
steel company in South Chicago. They had written 
to the college asking for recommendations for

05:03.032 --> 05:09.960
somebody be employed in their steam engineering 
department. So I had checked steam on this form and

05:15.612 --> 05:20.680
here came a request for a steam engineer. So the 
dean recommended me.

05:26.668 --> 05:35.061
So it was the first offer I'd had in just two or three 
weeks after graduation. So I wrote back and

05:35.081 --> 05:40.909
indicated I was interested in the job.

05:42.830 --> 05:43.571
the detail. But anyhow, I ended up in South Chicago 
in the steam engineering department of the South

05:44.472 --> 05:53.805
Works of the U.S. Steel Corporation, or at that 
time it was in Illinois. That was in 1915? 1915,

05:54.806 --> 05:57.030
summer of 1915. At that time it was the Illinois 
Steel Company, but it was a subsidiary of U.S.

05:58.512 --> 06:03.679
Steel. Just like across the border into Indiana 
was the Gehry Works, which is a subsidiary of the

06:05.561 --> 06:12.651
U.S. Steel. And there were a couple of other steel 
corporations there in South Chicago.

06:23.408 --> 06:30.375
So I showed up there, and I could tell a look of 
disappointment on their face.

06:33.218 --> 06:39.465
If you'd have read this letter of recommendation 
from my dean concerning me to the steel

06:33.218 --> 06:39.465
corporation, you would have thought that I was 
about a six and a half foot Irish giant. Of course,

06:46.241 --> 06:51.586
the apostrophe in the name gave them that 
implication. And

06:51.606 --> 07:08.541
when I walked in there, weighing 120 pounds and six 
and a half feet tall, you could just see the

06:51.606 --> 07:08.541
consternation over the faces of everybody in the 
office. And I had on a beautiful pink silk shirt and

07:09.820 --> 07:17.249
a bow tie and so forth. I looked like anything but a 
steel employee, I'll tell you that. Anyhow, they

07:23.055 --> 07:29.423
had to accept me, and they got me up there for that 
purpose. Well, I started in there with the title of

07:31.045 --> 07:39.034
steam expert in the steam engineering 
department.

07:44.178 --> 07:45.339
How long did you stay there? Until late spring of 
1918,

07:46.520 --> 07:56.549
when I left them and went into the Army in the First 
World War. Were you drafted? No, I volunteered. I

08:01.133 --> 08:02.514
don't know why I wasn't drafted. I've often 
wondered, but I think the reason was that in the

08:02.594 --> 08:09.340
first place, I didn't look like a soldier. I looked 
more like a high school kid. I've always said that

08:14.789 --> 08:17.692
has been one of my handicaps all my life. I always 
looked 10 years younger than I was.

08:24.439 --> 08:27.062
I used to be kidding about that. I had a sister who 
would look at a photograph of herself. And she'd

08:32.648 --> 08:33.849
pop. I would be, oh, 24, 25 years old. And she says, 
well, you look like you just graduated from high

08:36.411 --> 08:39.835
school. Well, I've had to put up with that all my 
life. Right now, at my age, I get out on the campus

08:43.325 --> 08:52.156
here and can't anybody believe that I'm 88 years 
old. I don't know what I look like, but according to

08:52.176 --> 09:01.688
my friends, I don't look over maybe 75, something

08:52.176 --> 09:01.688
like that. Which has always been a big joke to me. 
I've had that to endure all my life. How long you

09:07.996 --> 09:10.699
stayed in the Army, until 1919 or 1920?

09:16.113 --> 09:17.474
I would have had to get in. I don't believe I would 
have been drafted because the job I had there was a

09:17.535 --> 09:22.860
semi-technical job. And I've always felt, I'm not 
sure that this happened, that the draft board has

09:24.262 --> 09:32.811
sort of been told, just leave this fellow alone. We 
need him, you see. It was a specialized technical

09:34.893 --> 09:37.076
job. And I was the only one in the whole plant that 
did that work. I may be wrong about that. I used to

09:46.133 --> 09:53.160
get on the train at 53rd Street in Chicago and ride 
to 79th Street, where the office was. I'd be going

09:53.981 --> 10:04.171
in the opposite direction to traffic, because the 
traffic in those days was from the outside

09:53.981 --> 10:04.171
communities towards the Loop downtown. But I was 
going the opposite direction. There wouldn't be

10:05.893 --> 10:10.858
over half a dozen people on the train, so I could see 
everybody. And I looked, they were all old men.

10:13.806 --> 10:16.490
There wasn't a single young fella on the train. And 
I got a little bit self-conscious about it,

10:18.453 --> 10:33.015
thinking, well, maybe as young as I was, I was in 
good physical health and so forth, maybe I should

10:18.453 --> 10:33.015
be in the Army instead of riding this train with 
these old men. So I just got the notion one day and

10:34.632 --> 10:37.696
went down to the draft board. And I told them, I 
said, when is your next contingency leaving here

10:37.736 --> 10:43.042
for camp? And they told me, they said, well, I wish 
you'd put me in that list. I want to volunteer. And

10:48.248 --> 10:48.769
they did. So I got on a train there and rode to 
Rockford, Illinois. That's where they, in those

10:56.337 --> 11:01.163
days, they called it, what did they call it?

11:08.652 --> 11:09.773
name that had went by. But it's where the rookies 
were taken in. And they were disciplined there for

11:14.718 --> 11:19.342
a few weeks. And finally, they were sent to some 
specific department. Or rather, what happened,

11:28.170 --> 11:33.114
officers from other divisions would come there to 
the camp. And these rookies were all lined up. And

11:36.938 --> 11:38.119
they would come by. interview each fellow. And 
their idea was to choose people to go into certain

11:41.203 --> 11:50.274
divisions, and infantry, artillery, and so 
forth.

11:53.137 --> 11:57.903
So this one captain kept quizzing me. And he 
learned that I was a college graduate. And I think

12:02.649 --> 12:05.572
that's what convinced him. He chose me to go with 
him in the artillery.

12:10.803 --> 12:14.848
And

12:10.803 --> 12:14.848
that's what I did. And

12:14.888 --> 12:25.221
the next place I remember was Sparta, Wisconsin, 
where they had a rifle range. I don't know if you

12:25.241 --> 12:29.005
know where that is or not. It's near La Crosse, and 
La Crosse is right on the Mississippi River

12:29.025 --> 12:37.436
between Wisconsin and Minnesota. Sparta, 
Wisconsin.

12:42.848 --> 12:52.480
And I was definitely in the artillery then, 
Battery B, 333rd Field Artillery.

12:52.500 --> 12:57.967
And we had rifle practice there.

12:57.987 --> 13:01.552
And we were there five or six weeks.

13:05.016 --> 13:11.404
Then, of course, I don't know what happened, but 
the whole group then of this Battery, Battery B,

13:13.207 --> 13:19.215
left Sparta and we were put on the train to the east 
coast. We went first to camp on Long Island, where

13:20.697 --> 13:28.608
we stayed a few days, and then we were put on a boat 
and shipped to Europe. When did you reach Europe?

13:32.133 --> 13:33.695
Oh, let's see. Some summer of

13:38.350 --> 13:42.919
May have been July, August, something like that.

13:45.484 --> 13:48.630
Well, I never did get into action.

13:51.435 --> 13:59.751
What happened was that we were in the heavy field 
artillery.

14:06.042 --> 14:09.226
in the guns we were to use until we got in France. We 
landed in Glasgow, Scotland.

14:17.317 --> 14:32.137
I was with a group of senior citizens here on campus 
or at one of the hotels not long ago, and there was a

14:17.317 --> 14:32.137
little group of people there talking about 
traveling in England and Scotland, and most of it

14:17.317 --> 14:32.137
was about Scotland. Everybody had been to 
Edinburgh. I didn't say a word. And I didn't have

14:38.407 --> 14:40.610
any use of it. I didn't need to say a word. Some woman 
across the table says, have you been to Scotland?

14:48.158 --> 14:50.822
And I said, well, I've been to Glasgow. And what 
another word said. I couldn't tell them that I'd

14:56.007 --> 15:01.514
been to Edinburgh, which is what they'd been 
talking about, but I had been to Glasgow. I didn't

15:01.534 --> 15:05.158
tell them I was there only about five or six hours. 
We got off the boat of Glasgow, got on a train, and

15:05.729 --> 15:13.737
rode down through England to Southampton, which 
was on the Channel.

15:17.902 --> 15:20.545
I don't know how much you use this you want to see, 
I'm just rattling off. We were there at

15:22.667 --> 15:32.277
Southampton for a few hours,

15:22.667 --> 15:32.277
and we were Late that night, or after dark, we were 
put on a boat

15:33.910 --> 15:44.288
just across the channel. And I was, the next 
morning we woke up right back where we had been, in

15:45.951 --> 15:59.074
Southampton, and we started making inquiries, 
and somebody who seemed to know what he was talking

15:45.951 --> 15:59.074
about, one of the crew, boat crew or somebody, He 
says, well, he says, we started for Cherbourg, but

15:59.948 --> 16:04.297
we got chased back by U-boats. Well, that was quite 
an experience, even though we hadn't experienced

16:05.920 --> 16:11.151
it. So we stayed there all day long. And the next 
night, we started across again. And this time, we

16:18.025 --> 16:19.929
made it. We landed at Cherbourg.

16:29.362 --> 16:39.116
I remember

16:29.362 --> 16:39.116
it was the first time we'd taken a bath and had a 
change of clothing since we left the States. This

16:40.618 --> 16:53.818
was a shower bath, and you had just so many minutes 
in there, and if you didn't get the soap washed off

16:40.618 --> 16:53.818
at the proper time, you had to wipe it off with a 
towel. They'd just shut off the water. That's how

16:55.600 --> 16:56.702
scarce it was. Well, we were there in Cherbourg for 
maybe overnight or something like that. Then we

17:05.030 --> 17:16.264
were put on a train and we rode south through France 
to a camp.

17:19.067 --> 17:22.651
Southern France wasn't too far from the Spanish 
border. The largest city was Bordeaux, which was

17:23.852 --> 17:27.837
on the coast. And that's where we got our training 
with the guns. We were 155 millimeter height

17:33.029 --> 17:43.242
Snyder howitzers, which was a shell about six 
inches in diameter. We'd never seen one of them

17:43.903 --> 17:45.345
before. We'd never seen the guns. So

17:49.190 --> 17:55.138
before we left the States, I had been made a 
corporal. And soon after we got into France, I was

17:56.840 --> 17:59.764
made a sergeant. And I was a sergeant of a gun 
section, which included about,

18:01.837 --> 18:12.629
oh, I'd say 24 men altogether. Three squads, eight 
men per squad. And there were several of those

18:19.256 --> 18:21.979
sections in the battery. So I was one among four, 
five, or six sergeants. And of course, above us was

18:27.885 --> 18:30.308
the top sergeant.

18:38.911 --> 18:44.339
because you had no responsibility whatsoever. 
You got your orders from the officers above,

18:44.359 --> 18:56.397
captain, lieutenant, second lieutenant, and 
then you passed them on to the corporals, and they

18:44.359 --> 18:56.397
would pass them on to the men. That was the system. 
So a sergeant didn't have to know anything other

18:58.480 --> 19:06.572
than just how to translate a message from the 
officers to the lower ranks. That's an

19:07.919 --> 19:09.121
exaggeration. I did know something about it. As a 
matter of fact, I knew as much about it as any man in

19:12.565 --> 19:15.750
the battery.

19:18.854 --> 19:21.738
You couldn't escape learning it. How long were you 
there before you were sent back to the United

19:21.758 --> 19:24.401
States? Well, of course, the armistice came in 
November the 11th. We'd had a false alarm about a

19:31.411 --> 19:34.635
week ahead of time. And we all celebrated the 
armistice. So when it came on November the 11th, we

19:39.430 --> 19:43.436
didn't pay a damn little attention to it. It just 
made no impression whatsoever. It was a letdown,

19:45.860 --> 19:54.794
because this false information that had been let 
out there in the camp where we were a week ahead of

19:45.860 --> 19:54.794
time, we'd already done the celebrating. So the 
war didn't actually end until November the 11th.

19:58.360 --> 20:01.585
By that time, as far as we'd be concerned, it had 
been over for a week. So we loafed there in camp

20:03.573 --> 20:08.959
until I believe it was Christmas Day. Or maybe the 
day before Christmas, we marched from this camp to

20:11.041 --> 20:15.346
Bordeaux. And on Christmas morning, we got on a 
boat. And on New Year's Day, we got off of that boat

20:20.551 --> 20:25.857
in New York City. About seven days coming back, 
going over it took 14 days. Do you think that if the

20:32.834 --> 20:38.923
U.S. had joined the League of Nations that some of 
the problems that occurred after World War I might

20:32.834 --> 20:38.923
have been avoided?

20:45.032 --> 20:46.114
After World War I? No. You don't think the League of 
Nations would have been any more effective than

20:48.858 --> 20:52.003
the U.N.? No. The Germans had been defeated. 
Tactically, militarily, economically, they

20:58.072 --> 21:02.098
were defeated. But within themselves, they were 
never defeated, and they were going to start a war

21:03.175 --> 21:08.062
sooner or later. And they did. Do you think the 
peace terms that were imposed on the Germans were

21:09.604 --> 21:13.570
harsh? No, no, that didn't happen to them. They may 
or may not have been, but it had nothing to do with

21:15.854 --> 21:19.940
the Second World War. Okay, when you were back in 
the United States in 1919, New Year's Day, what

21:22.243 --> 21:26.389
happened? What did you do to pursue then? We just 
waited around for another 30 days until we were

21:27.931 --> 21:31.697
discharged. And then where did you go after you 
were discharged? It was late in January when we

21:34.205 --> 21:37.988
were discharged. So I was in the Army altogether, 
I'd say about ten

21:38.008 --> 21:45.716
months, something like that, nine or ten months. 
About three months in France, and the rest of the

21:47.037 --> 21:53.983
time in this country, either before or after being 
in the Army. Where did you go after you were

21:54.003 --> 21:55.985
discharged here? Well, that's a long story. Well, 
just ultimately, where did you go? I had a sister

22:02.035 --> 22:05.640
who lived in Elyria, Ohio.

22:07.583 --> 22:09.446
E-L-Y-R-I-A. It's about 20 miles west of 
Cleveland.

22:14.072 --> 22:24.167
And her husband was...

22:14.072 --> 22:24.167
What do you call him?

22:26.891 --> 22:28.633
He ran the city government down. What did he call 
those people in those days? City manager. City

22:31.929 --> 22:34.592
manager, something like, some title similar to 
that. I don't think they sent him city manager, but

22:35.372 --> 22:38.095
some other title.

22:41.618 --> 22:44.341
And he knew some businessmen there in Elyria. 
Well, I went by Elyria just as a means. And he was the

22:47.604 --> 22:50.707
city manager of Elyria or of Cleveland? Elyria. I 
was on my way home to Kentucky and just went by

22:52.369 --> 22:56.933
Elyria to visit my sister. I had shipped my 
personal belongings to her when I left Chicago to

22:57.368 --> 23:03.598
go into the Army. I had some books and other things 
that I had shipped to her. So I went by there and

23:08.827 --> 23:12.393
picked that up and then went on to Kentucky. But my 
brother-in-law had his acquaintances there of

23:12.513 --> 23:21.688
area businessmen.

23:23.575 --> 23:35.654
He knew the superintendent of the blast furnace 
department in the National Tube Company, Lorain,

23:23.575 --> 23:35.654
Ohio, which was right on the lake. That was the 
industrial city for that part of northern Ohio. Is

23:42.765 --> 23:44.167
that Lorain with two R's? No. L-O-R-A-I-N-D? I 
think so, yeah. I'm not sure.

23:53.005 --> 24:01.060
where the top personnel lived who worked for the 
steel company in Elyria. So I commuted, when I got

24:02.883 --> 24:10.777
the job, I commuted from Elyria to Lorain and 
worked there at the National Tube Company. And I

24:12.360 --> 24:17.089
got that job, as I say, through the fact that my 
brother-in-law had acquainted with some of the

24:19.263 --> 24:23.511
officers, and they found out that I was looking for 
a job. And what really got me the job was that the

24:23.531 --> 24:38.578
work that I had done at the South Works plant in 
South Chicago was the kind of work for which they

24:23.531 --> 24:38.578
wanted a man, to hire a man there at Lorraine. So 
since I had that experience, it was easy for me to

24:39.259 --> 24:43.026
get the job.

24:52.237 --> 24:55.121
months at the most. I wasn't happy with it. It was a 
letdown from what I had done in South Chicago. In

25:03.091 --> 25:12.964
South Chicago, I had charge of certain accounts 
which included every department in the whole

25:03.091 --> 25:12.964
plant. And Lorraine, with the National Tube 
Company,

25:21.818 --> 25:31.594
which was a rather narrow line of duty compared to 
what I'd had in South Chicago, so it didn't

25:21.818 --> 25:31.594
fascinate me in the slightest. Then what did you do 
after that?

25:35.721 --> 25:42.272
Well,

25:35.721 --> 25:42.272
there was a great building boom going on at that 
time. See, this is back in 1919. World War was over,

25:47.300 --> 26:00.054
business began to take up, to pick up, and a

25:47.300 --> 26:00.054
lot of construction work going on. And as I said, 
almost in the beginning, I had grown up in the

26:01.656 --> 26:16.632
construction business, you might say, because 
that had been a hobby of my father, buying and

26:01.656 --> 26:16.632
selling houses. remodeling them and so forth and 
so on. Most of the labor he used for that purpose was

26:20.386 --> 26:32.580
patients of his who hadn't paid their accounts, so 
he'd get work out of

26:20.386 --> 26:32.580
them. Well, anyhow, there was a building boom 
going on there in Elyria, and my brother-in-law

26:32.600 --> 26:43.092
sort of encouraged me to get into that. My father, 
when he heard about it, sort of gave me some

26:44.337 --> 26:49.583
encouragement. As a matter of fact, he lent me some 
money to buy a lot there. And I was going to build on

26:52.667 --> 26:56.792
that lot. In the meantime, before I reached that 
point, I built a residence for my brother-in-law

26:56.852 --> 27:11.509
and another residence I built for one of the men I 
had known at the steelworks, Lorraine. And this

27:13.700 --> 27:19.951
third house was one which would have belonged to me 
with the money that the father lent me to buy the

27:13.700 --> 27:19.951
lot. So, it looked as though I was going to be a 
building contractor.

27:29.367 --> 27:33.173
I went on home on vacation after being in the army.

27:38.062 --> 27:38.222
And

27:42.353 --> 27:45.898
Excuse me, but this story's got to stop someplace. 
I can't go on forever. Well, after, where did you

27:47.961 --> 27:51.145
finally? I went, let me tell you how I got into the 
education business. All right, let's just move to

27:55.591 --> 27:57.754
that. On my way home from Larry, Ohio to Stanford, 
Kentucky, I stopped at Lexington and visited the

27:59.296 --> 28:09.951
university where I had graduated. 1920? Yeah. 
This was in 1920, where I had graduated five years

28:12.712 --> 28:21.641
earlier, and this was the first time I had been back 
there. So I went by the campus, and I visited some

28:23.382 --> 28:37.877
old professors in the department that I had 
remembered from five years earlier, and saw some

28:23.382 --> 28:37.877
new buildings and so forth, and ended up in the 
dean's office. And just like you and I are talking

28:37.897 --> 28:40.339
now, The dean and I started talking about myself. 
He wanted to know what I had been doing. So I didn't

28:46.585 --> 28:48.287
take this long, I don't think. But I told him about 
my experience at South Chicago with the Steel

28:48.968 --> 28:59.763
Corporation and being in the Army and then working 
for the National Tube Company in Lorain and so

28:48.968 --> 28:59.763
forth and so on. And I about wore him out. He wore me 
out. So we got up and we started out. And I don't

29:10.053 --> 29:22.967
know, we was halfway from the entrance to the 
building to the pavement, sidewalk, when he said

29:10.053 --> 29:22.967
something about teaching. I don't exactly know 
what. Anyhow, I said, well, you know, I've often

29:26.671 --> 29:29.754
thought I'd like to teach. He grabbed me by the arm 
and he almost shook me off my feet. He says, you're

29:34.179 --> 29:36.081
just the man I'm looking for. You're just the man 
I'm looking for. He said, was $2,000 interest you?

29:44.390 --> 29:51.039
Well, that was for 10 months' work, but $200 a 
month, which is more than I'd ever made anywhere in

29:44.390 --> 29:51.039
all my life up to that time. So that was no problem. 
The question was whether I really wanted to teach

29:52.801 --> 29:56.525
or not. Anyhow, I went on home

29:56.546 --> 30:05.417
and talked to my father about it, and he wasn't too 
interested in that. He was thinking about backing

30:05.477 --> 30:08.781
me financially in this building profession, 
industry up in Northern Ohio, you see. That was his

30:14.277 --> 30:15.078
hobby. And he could visualize my doing that. But I 
was truthful when I remarked to the dean that I had

30:20.589 --> 30:27.903
often thought that maybe I'd like to teach. And he 
had just lost his man in the department in who was

30:33.736 --> 30:42.445
teaching the sort of stuff for which I 
specifically had the experience with the Steel

30:33.736 --> 30:42.445
Corporation. And that's what he meant when he 
says, I'm just the man you're looking for, that I'm

30:42.465 --> 30:50.995
looking for, just the man I'm looking for. Well, I 
finally did accept and started teaching there.

30:54.839 --> 30:56.360
And you were teaching what? 1st of September in 
1920. And you were teaching what? In the

31:00.825 --> 31:02.427
Mechanical Engineering Department. My major 
subjects were thermodynamics,

31:03.233 --> 31:12.604
heat power engineering, steam engines, steam 
boilers, and things like that. How long did you

31:13.465 --> 31:17.029
stay teaching in class? Oh, my goodness.

31:21.255 --> 31:24.919
I had different assignments, different duties. 
But I would say I always taught. even though I was

31:30.520 --> 31:33.666
doing something else, research or something like 
that. I never considered myself as being away from

31:34.387 --> 31:50.175
teaching from 1920 to 1946

31:34.387 --> 31:50.175
at Lexington. And then I had two years at the 
University of Michigan. 1946, 47, 48 and I came

31:56.052 --> 31:58.897
here in the fall of 48. University of Michigan at 
where? University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Okay,

32:04.448 --> 32:12.323
what were some of the changes that you saw at the 
University of Kentucky at

32:28.098 --> 32:30.060
Well, you see, there was a depression. First, 
there was a considerable expansion through the

32:30.840 --> 32:39.227
20s, economic prosperity.

32:41.609 --> 32:43.911
Then there was a stock market crash in 29. Then 
there was depression through the 30s. And then

32:47.975 --> 32:49.276
there was the World War. For us, that was from, 
what, 41 to 45. So a lot of things happened in that

32:55.241 --> 32:57.683
period.

33:24.460 --> 33:30.425
When I started in there in 1920, the college 
professors ran everything. We had a top

33:32.267 --> 33:37.372
administration, but they were just figureheads. 
Their main job was looking after the finances and

33:37.392 --> 33:53.286
collecting fees and making up schedules, 
budgets, and so forth, and paying the proceeds out

33:37.392 --> 33:53.286
to the state. We had a Senate, which consisted of 
all professorial ranks from assistant professor

33:54.802 --> 34:04.293
up, including the deans. We had an assembly. Well, 
first, that Senate met once a month. Then there was

34:10.541 --> 34:18.290
an assembly, which included every employee of the 
university, which assembled once a semester.

34:19.431 --> 34:21.754
That was mostly just a social gathering.

34:24.350 --> 34:31.762
Then there was a

34:24.350 --> 34:31.762
committee of deans. That wasn't the name they went 
by, but it consisted of all the deans of all the

34:33.865 --> 34:44.943
colleges, plus the business manager and the 
registrar and the president. The president

34:45.725 --> 34:47.888
presided.

34:51.234 --> 34:52.095
Then There was the board, what we called board of 
trustees at that time, board of directors, other

34:53.459 --> 34:58.988
places.

35:02.052 --> 35:03.495
And then the state legislature. You had the state 
legislature, the board of directors, the... What

35:03.555 --> 35:15.353
you're saying is that this administrative 
bureaucracy took the power away from the college

35:03.555 --> 35:15.353
professors. I'm telling you what the setup was. 
State legislature, board of trustees, the top

35:22.079 --> 35:35.958
echelon among the deans and administrators, the 
Senate, which included all of the faculty,

35:22.079 --> 35:35.958
assistant professor and above, and the Assembly, 
which included all employees of the college. The

35:36.258 --> 35:46.452
business of the whole college was divided or split 
among those divisions of administration. But the

35:48.194 --> 35:51.799
college professors themselves practically ran 
everything, Nothing was ever done that wasn't

35:52.252 --> 36:03.622
approved by the Senate, which included assistant 
professors, associate professors, professors,

35:52.252 --> 36:03.622
heads of departments, and the deans. It included 
the teaching personnel. That changed

36:09.287 --> 36:13.270
drastically and dramatically during the 
Depression.

36:16.433 --> 36:21.938
Because during the Depression, it was the 
finances that were important. You didn't care

36:22.610 --> 36:29.879
about that so long as we had a job OK. And nobody 
cared whether we were teaching good or bad. It was a

36:29.939 --> 36:32.782
question of having a job, holding a job. So that the 
business of operating the university switched

36:33.783 --> 36:51.925
from education to the monetary aspects of getting 
enough money to pay the salaries of the people who

36:33.783 --> 36:51.925
ran the college. So that meant that the 
responsibilities shifted from the lower ranks to

36:53.558 --> 37:15.778
the people at the top,

36:53.558 --> 37:15.778
particularly the board of directors, who had 
contact with the legislators and the politicians

36:53.558 --> 37:15.778
throughout the state and so forth and so on, who 
could supply the financial income that was

36:53.558 --> 37:15.778
needed. So education per se dropped out of the 
picture. And money became the important

37:22.702 --> 37:26.247
consideration. Where were you going to get the 
money? Did you get your advanced degree at the

37:28.731 --> 37:32.316
University of Kentucky at Lexington? Well, I got 
my M.E. degree there, yeah. What year?

37:37.924 --> 37:40.447
Well, there's a story about that. If you were a 
member of the Senate, you could not be given a

37:42.911 --> 37:52.084
degree because you couldn't give a degree to 
yourself because the Senate gave degrees. Since I

37:52.520 --> 38:09.543
started out as an assistant professor, went on to 
associate professor, professor, head of the

37:52.520 --> 38:09.543
department,

37:52.520 --> 38:09.543
and gotten that far by the middle 30s, I never had a 
chance to get a degree there. I'd have to leave

38:09.883 --> 38:12.327
Kentucky and go someplace else. But

38:14.730 --> 38:20.097
in the middle 30s,

38:26.101 --> 38:54.353
The

38:26.101 --> 38:54.353
dean of agriculture and director of the 
Agriculture Experiment Station was trying to

38:26.101 --> 38:54.353
hire one of my men from under me to

38:26.101 --> 38:54.353
look after some of the mechanical engineering 
aspects of a new laboratory he was building for the

38:26.101 --> 38:54.353
Agriculture Department. And this young man did 
not want to be transferred. Well, I was a little bit

39:02.543 --> 39:06.047
unhappy with things at that time, middle of the 
Depression. And in the meantime, my old boss, dean

39:07.749 --> 39:12.194
of engineering, had died. And a new man had come in. 
And I wasn't very happy. So I learned that this

39:19.763 --> 39:23.007
young man didn't want to take this job. I just 
thought came to me, well, by golly, I'm just going

39:23.577 --> 39:28.304
over there and apply for that job myself. And I did 
that and I got it. My salary was pretty good at that

39:33.753 --> 39:35.495
time. I was head of the department and they 
couldn't pay me my current salary. But the

39:41.344 --> 39:43.548
president of the university fixed that. He said, 
well, that's easy. We just divide his salary

39:44.810 --> 39:48.876
between agriculture and engineering. So to make a 
long story short, I spent 10 years there from 1936

39:50.678 --> 40:08.463
to 1946

39:50.678 --> 40:08.463
as a research mechanical engineer in the College 
of Agriculture. I went there to design this

40:08.483 --> 40:14.391
laboratory, which included a substantial 
investment in a lot of mechanical equipment. And

40:16.362 --> 40:22.570
that took longer than we anticipated because we 
couldn't get some of the equipment that we needed,

40:16.362 --> 40:22.570
so that ran into the second year. And then I got 
involved in some other mechanical phases of that

40:24.272 --> 40:45.998
department, and my duties there just grew and 
expanded so that I wound up spending ten years

40:24.272 --> 40:45.998
there. And as I've said before, that it was in fact 
10 of the most pleasant years of all my experience.

40:55.416 --> 40:55.777
Why? Just imagine yourself as being the one 
mechanical engineer among a group of all those

40:57.178 --> 41:06.369
agriculture specialists, both animal and 
vegetable. And you were acting as a consultant to

41:08.311 --> 41:10.693
them. And you had no competition. You were the one. 
And I'm telling you, it was a lot of fun, and I had a

41:16.370 --> 41:24.703
lot of pleasant experiences there, and I did a lot 
of work for them. Now where was this? This is in

41:25.765 --> 41:29.251
Lexington, Kentucky. My work pertained chiefly 
to the tobacco industry, although that wasn't in

41:29.431 --> 41:36.502
all of it. I designed two laboratories for spin 
metal work on the curing of tobacco.

41:51.908 --> 41:57.695
data on what was happening to the tobacco going 
through different weather conditions. I had a

41:59.117 --> 42:15.756
weather station which included outdoor 
temperatures, wet-bubble temperatures where I

41:59.117 --> 42:15.756
could get dew points and relative humidity, wind 
velocity, wind direction, and so forth. I had

42:15.776 --> 42:18.760
almost a complete weather station. which I 
devised myself, built some of the equipment, and I

42:19.432 --> 42:40.779
would,

42:19.432 --> 42:40.779
in the tobacco season in particular, curing 
season, I would keep these records and try to

42:19.432 --> 42:40.779
relate what was happening to the tobacco to the 
outside weather conditions.

42:44.203 --> 42:44.764
So, This change in position, although I really 
never stopped teaching,

42:46.448 --> 43:04.937
made it possible for me to suggest to the powers 
that be that since I was no longer a member of the

42:46.448 --> 43:04.937
Senate, I could get an advanced degree. So I did 
that. I wrote a dissertation, applied for a

43:10.065 --> 43:14.312
degree, and so forth,

43:18.106 --> 43:26.217
It was concerned with this laboratory that I'd 
built and designed and built for them. And I used it

43:28.180 --> 43:31.344
as the basis for the dissertation.

43:34.308 --> 43:41.317
It was a description of an engineering job, which 
they accepted as being suitable for an

43:34.308 --> 43:41.317
engineering degree. When did you marry? Oh, that 
was back in 1922.

43:47.620 --> 43:51.807
My wife and I started teaching at the University of 
Kentucky, but the same year. What did she teach?

43:52.628 --> 43:55.333
September of 1920.

44:00.100 --> 44:03.646
Well, what did she teach? First place, she 
graduated from Mount Holyoke College with a

44:03.666 --> 44:08.494
bachelor's degree. That's in Massachusetts. I 
don't know where you know where that is. It's a

44:12.681 --> 44:14.083
women's college.

44:16.797 --> 44:19.220
She spent four years there and got a bachelor's 
degree. And then she went to Cornell University,

44:19.240 --> 44:22.665
got a master's degree.

44:25.468 --> 44:32.237
And she was employed at the University of Kentucky 
in the fall of 1920 in the zoology department. And

44:33.779 --> 44:44.053
her teaching specialty was histology and 
embryology,

44:33.779 --> 44:44.053
which worked that she had taken chiefly at 
Cornell.

44:49.703 --> 44:57.614
And we belonged to a group of faculty there that 
socialized and had parties and so forth and so on.

44:57.654 --> 44:58.415
We got acquainted. And we married in 1922.

45:07.047 --> 45:10.231
It was two years after we had started teaching. Why 
did you decide?

45:27.470 --> 45:30.055
I don't know whether you're interested in all this 
junk or not. Just make it free. You don't have to

45:31.899 --> 45:33.302
give all the time. Well, it's a trouble. It can't be
