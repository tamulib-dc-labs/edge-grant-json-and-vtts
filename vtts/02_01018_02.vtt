WEBVTT

00:01.297 --> 00:05.081
I mean, that's one of the problems with the Hanoi. 
Okay. Why do we use a one-year tour instead of a

00:06.603 --> 00:11.047
duration tour? Well, this was what they decided to 
do, and

00:11.067 --> 00:23.360
I don't think we would use duration ever, really. I 
mean, we didn't use it in the Second World War. But

00:27.124 --> 00:31.168
that one year, I think, was a mistake.

00:32.583 --> 00:35.626
because it's hard to build up the morale of units 
and get used to them. But I think two years would

00:36.487 --> 00:39.591
have been better, or eighteen months. We've had 
quite a few men who've said, because it wasn't even

00:39.871 --> 00:46.679
units that win, it was individuals— That's 
correct. —and that you get to battle and you really

00:46.699 --> 00:51.484
want to know if that guy behind you is going to stay 
there or turn around and run. That's right. Well,

00:52.125 --> 00:54.287
that's a debatable issue. They did it because they 
wanted people to know that They'd much rather have

00:57.119 --> 01:05.752
a great many Americans go over there and do their 
year than to hang the burden of this on a limited

00:57.119 --> 01:05.752
number of people. And they were worried initially 
also about

01:06.313 --> 01:21.276
how Americans from a temperate climate would 
operate in a tropical climate and so on, because

01:06.313 --> 01:21.276
parts of it were tropical. So there were a number of 
considerations, and, you know, it's a perfectly

01:21.296 --> 01:25.523
good issue

01:30.937 --> 01:36.182
asked several times that they be mobilized.

01:38.464 --> 01:38.944
I don't know. See, I didn't remember in 1965. I came 
in in 1966, and a lot of the decisions were made in

01:41.826 --> 01:49.273
1965 before my time. I don't know. You're talking 
about the—you mean the— National Reserve. You

01:57.000 --> 01:58.021
mean the National Guard? Yes, sir. Well, I don't 
know. We had conscription, and the—I don't know. I

02:12.102 --> 02:21.236
mean, a lot of people in the National Guard were 
conscripted, but I don't know the answer to that

02:12.102 --> 02:21.236
question. Okay. Thank you. The U.S. did not want to 
create an image of a colonial empire fighting in

02:21.677 --> 02:29.209
Asia, and what impact did this have on 
decision-making as far as maybe troop strength

02:29.257 --> 02:41.715
and maybe even the role of the military as far as 
maybe the general having one—Harvin in the U.S.

02:29.257 --> 02:41.715
under one command, under one leader?

02:46.322 --> 02:56.277
Well, Westy had command of everything but 
effective command, even over

03:01.471 --> 03:03.278
most of the naval forces that were close in. One 
thing he didn't have were the B-36s, but he had a lot

03:03.680 --> 03:11.110
of B-52s, rather, but he had a lot of influence over 
the targets on the B-52s. I don't think the

03:11.512 --> 03:17.743
question of unity of command was terribly 
important in the fight. And I don't think the

03:17.763 --> 03:22.330
question of not appearing in a colonial empire or 
anything like that. We were fighting for the

03:22.370 --> 03:32.548
independence of this country as we were in Korea, 
and we had more non-U.S. forces there. We had two

03:32.588 --> 03:37.536
Australians, New Zealanders, two Korean 
Philippines. That was mainly cosmetic. But the—I

03:43.918 --> 03:47.322
don't know. We weren't—that was for the 
newspapers back home and the student protesters,

03:47.382 --> 03:53.731
not for the people of Asia. They knew what we were 
doing.

03:57.916 --> 04:04.485
How much did LBJ's belief that the U.S. was the 
policeman of the world make his commitment to

03:57.916 --> 04:04.485
Vietnam even stronger?

04:07.452 --> 04:08.973
really are a silly young man. Who, what is your 
evidence that he believed the United States was

04:09.794 --> 04:15.680
the policeman of the world? Well, to tell you the 
truth, I read it out of John Stessinger's book

04:15.700 --> 04:27.912
here, Crusaders and Pragmatists, and that's what 
he considers LBJ, that possibly us going into

04:15.700 --> 04:27.912
Guatemala in 1965. He didn't go to Guatemala in 
1965. Or the Dominican Republic.

04:39.599 --> 04:52.595
the Latin Americans wouldn't acknowledge it, but 
then he had an OAS operation there, a very

04:39.599 --> 04:52.595
successful OAS election, and he was in there for 
serious strategic reasons under OAS doctrine.

04:54.478 --> 05:01.266
But the point about it is, if you've ever worked 
with a president, you know, the last thing in the

04:54.478 --> 05:01.266
world he wants to do is commit U.S. forces. The last 
thing. And the notion that, I don't care who, I

05:03.749 --> 05:08.475
don't know who Sessinger is, but The point is that 
the notion—and there are any number of cases in the

05:08.708 --> 05:37.180
six, eight years I was there in which, you know, we 
just let something happen rather than get

05:08.708 --> 05:37.180
involved, whether it was Westerion or Ghana or, 
you know, Guinea or Guantanamo, where you just

05:08.708 --> 05:37.180
turned off the water, you know, and they turned off 
the water, so we went and got another alternative

05:08.708 --> 05:37.180
source of water. president the last thing in the 
world, because aside from the human fact that

05:38.425 --> 05:51.899
people get killed when you start fighting, and 
you're commander-in-chief, and don't think

05:38.425 --> 05:51.899
that's trivial. You lose all sense of it in these 
books you read. But the other thing a politician

05:55.263 --> 06:04.312
knows, he's going to lose in the polls by getting 
involved, unless it's some very, you know, quick,

05:55.263 --> 06:04.312
cosmetic thing like Grenada. But the

06:09.340 --> 06:16.988
they know what happened at Truman and what happens 
in any protracted war on democracy. So Lyndon

06:17.008 --> 06:24.456
Johnson had, you know, burning cities, a 
tremendous program he wanted to get through. He

06:24.476 --> 06:36.529
inherited the race crisis, which from Watson on 
was roaring through the northern cities, a really

06:24.476 --> 06:36.529
very dangerous phase. wanted to do a lot about 
social welfare, and he did. And he had this war he

06:41.270 --> 06:45.794
inherited. The notion that he was out looking to be 
a policeman of the world was just nonsense.

06:53.181 --> 07:00.809
My last question would be, did Nixon overcome the 
Tocqueville Oscillation, or did he give in to it?

07:02.250 --> 07:03.351
Well, it's a good question. It's the first good 
question you've asked. I think that he was, there

07:08.808 --> 07:16.338
was a certain amount of it that he felt he had to give 
in to. You know, the Guam Doctrine were pulling

07:16.358 --> 07:22.145
back, and I remember at that time a Soviet didn't 
sit. Well, our policy will be to move into the empty

07:23.487 --> 07:29.755
chairs left by U.S. diplomacy. And there was that 
69 thing, which

07:38.322 --> 07:51.493
doctrine of extending power around the whole 
periphery of Asia, from Vladivostok through the

07:38.322 --> 07:51.493
Indian Ocean to Ethiopia, which was enunciated by 
Brezhnev about that. But basically, I think if he

07:51.513 --> 08:00.261
hadn't collapsed with Watergate,

07:51.513 --> 08:00.261
you might have had a fairly stable period. I don't 
think for a minute they would have gone in in 75.

08:05.325 --> 08:07.907
And, uh, but once the system, the president lost 
legitimacy. And that took place in the course of

08:12.789 --> 08:19.464
the year 73, I'd say, before he actually was 
president. You could just see it dragging him down

08:19.484 --> 08:26.200
and limiting him, and then the Congress getting 
like a voracious animal.

08:29.656 --> 08:30.938
What is it? And the domestic economy really is 
struggling, too. And the domestic economy is

08:34.624 --> 08:36.146
struggling. Well, that's why this thing is so 
interesting. Communists do something which they

08:39.351 --> 08:42.636
call correlation of force analysis. If you want to 
see what it is, get

08:43.337 --> 08:52.271
this fellow's account and see what he takes into 
account here. And it's fascinating, because it

08:53.933 --> 08:56.237
really is He says, well, we took stock. We took 
stock. And here's what they said, all right.

09:03.716 --> 09:09.683
Morale was shot and was greatly weakened with the 
enemy's forces. Fiscal, 72, 73—this was fiscal

09:10.104 --> 09:12.527
years. The U.S. had given the puppet troops 2.2 
billion. This aid was reduced to 900 million, 73,

09:17.233 --> 09:22.059
74, 700 million. Thieu was then forced to fight a 
poor man's war. Mobility was reduced by a half.

09:30.956 --> 09:45.895
Then here comes Watergate scandals,

09:30.956 --> 09:45.895
resignation, Nixon, economic recession, 
mounting inflation, serious unemployment, and

09:30.956 --> 09:45.895
an oil crisis. And those things lined all up 
together.

09:54.841 --> 09:59.426
cut to his throat, and they're tied up with all this 
stuff, and that's why they did it. I don't think

10:00.667 --> 10:16.725
they would have done it if Nixon—after all, he had 
the biggest victory, practically, as big a

10:00.667 --> 10:16.725
victory as any president had in 72, which is not—it 
was partly peace and prosperity, but it was partly

10:00.667 --> 10:16.725
running against McGovern, a very weak candidate. 
And he had a clear run, and he blew it. And this whole

10:21.301 --> 10:24.023
system went out of whack. And, of course, you did 
have these problems, the other problems, but it

10:24.043 --> 10:34.593
was mainly a situation in which the president 
self-destructed, and the system doesn't work

10:24.043 --> 10:34.593
without a president. So I think that it's—he had a 
fair chance. In fact, I did a paper the other day,

10:40.718 --> 10:46.463
delivered it in Ohio, on how the Cold War might end. 
It's really on the Tocqueville Oscillation. I

10:50.495 --> 11:00.126
said in retrospect, I think this third cycle we've 
had was unnecessary,

10:50.495 --> 11:00.126
and—but I won't burden you with that. The short 
answer is to your question. I think Nixon had a

11:02.849 --> 11:05.913
chance, but water gave blue. Okay. And then 
something semi—a lot of people now are starting

11:08.315 --> 11:15.844
to—the Vietnam Syndrome, I believe you know, we 
were in. pretty much with Carter, that we don't

11:16.212 --> 11:19.796
want to get involved. We're sort of almost 
isolationist. And in Central America now, a lot of

11:22.319 --> 11:29.307
people are making comparisons between Vietnam 
and Central America and saying, you know, we're

11:22.319 --> 11:29.307
going down the same road. So are we currently then 
with Central America involved in the

11:29.988 --> 11:34.934
oscillation, in your opinion? Do you think we 
could maybe do more than we're doing? I don't know

11:38.118 --> 11:40.640
enough about Central America. I've written, 
well, a dozen or so books since leaving

11:40.660 --> 11:45.426
government, and this was the second of them. And I 
really haven't worked on it. So I don't know about

11:48.249 --> 11:50.893
Central America. Off the hip, maybe? What is it? 
Off the hip, just shooting away what you think just

11:53.216 --> 11:56.460
off the top of your head? No, I'm not going to shoot 
off— There we go. Well, can I turn off the tape

11:59.645 --> 12:06.334
recorder and then maybe— No, I don't really know.

12:06.955 --> 12:15.945
Before you can form a serious judgment, you've got 
to know, I don't know what the internal situation

12:06.955 --> 12:15.945
is in Nicaragua. I've got an impression I don't 
know what the Russians feel, whether the Russians

12:15.965 --> 12:26.376
want to push this hard or Castro wants to push it 
hard. I don't have any—there's too many questions

12:26.997 --> 12:32.083
I can't answer, so let's leave it. My last question 
here— This is the third last question. This is my

12:36.250 --> 12:37.852
last one. This is your last one. This is. I 
guarantee it. You stated that Johnson said that in

12:41.656 --> 12:45.901
this job you must set a standard for making 
decisions. That's right. Mine is, what will my

12:46.561 --> 12:51.226
grandchildren think of my administration when 
I'm buried under the tree at the ranch? Correct.

12:53.269 --> 12:59.656
What do you think they will think of his policy in 
Vietnam now, twenty years after we got initially

12:53.269 --> 12:59.656
involved? I tell you, I don't think it's—

13:06.389 --> 13:07.571
I don't think we will know. I'll tell you why. Are 
you still trying to figure it out? No, I'll tell you

13:13.479 --> 13:14.641
something else. I think that

13:14.741 --> 13:26.457
the importance he attached to Southeast Asia and 
Asia will be recognized as correct. the notion

13:28.613 --> 13:36.546
that, as one of my old friends and colleagues said 
at the time, let's return Southeast Asia to the

13:28.613 --> 13:36.546
obscurity it so richly deserves. I don't think 
that's it. That is going to be the view of history. I

13:41.834 --> 13:44.639
think it's an extremely important strategic part 
of the world. And out of the accident of the way it

13:46.121 --> 13:52.772
happened in 75,

13:46.121 --> 13:52.772
the worst didn't happen. It's really the next to 
the worst happened. If the President of the United

13:55.580 --> 14:03.551
States had said, this is all a mistake, I'm pulling 
out, and Congress backed him, then you would have

13:55.580 --> 14:03.551
had a true catastrophe. But Congress did it. The 
President stood out. Maya Ghez was a symbol of

14:08.056 --> 14:11.401
that, and Ford. And then Ford, and then Jimmy 
Carter, and now Reagan have thrown their weight of

14:12.422 --> 14:24.338
support behind ASEAN.

14:24.875 --> 14:32.928
you're left with a very dangerous position for 
Thailand and the Russians in Cam Ranh Bay and the

14:24.875 --> 14:32.928
Russians at the Vang airfield. But still, 
Southeast Asia has not collapsed. Indochina has

14:35.852 --> 14:38.677
collapsed. And what we're trying to prevent is 
what we have now, which is communist forces on this

14:38.697 --> 14:45.568
long and very difficult frontier of Thailand. 
Now, if out of the dynamics of history

14:52.162 --> 14:57.948
Finally, they never get around to trying to take 
over Thailand. If they do, there's going to be a

14:57.988 --> 14:59.329
war. Let's take the best. There's no way they have 
to take over Thailand. Finally, a generation

15:06.517 --> 15:12.143
comes along in Hanoi and says, We can't go on at 
seventy-five dollars per income. Everyone

15:12.203 --> 15:14.225
around here has got two thousand dollars. We've 
got to develop like the rest of Asia. And they get

15:17.368 --> 15:19.030
bored with being colonial power in Cambodia and 
Laos, go home and start raising some, you know,

15:21.423 --> 15:28.470
industry. They'd be very good at it if they could 
only get some leaders who were interested in it.

15:33.956 --> 15:37.600
And they become part of Asia, this vital Asia, and 
the whole thing subsides.

15:40.944 --> 15:41.945
Then what'll it be? It'll be what Lyndon Johnson 
did. And the people of Asia was by ten critical

15:45.829 --> 15:49.793
years

15:53.384 --> 16:03.434
I think everyone would agree, and if you look back, 
the thing would have collapsed in 55 if the United

15:53.384 --> 16:03.434
States had said, sorry, boys, you're nice 
fellows, but this is not our interest. We signed

16:04.135 --> 16:07.818
that thing in 55, but we don't really believe it's 
in 65.

16:13.524 --> 16:15.286
But it was different ten years later. So there's a 
fair chance, but I don't know. that people will

16:19.118 --> 16:23.683
say, well, it was not what they should have done, 
and if they went into it, they should have won. But

16:23.743 --> 16:39.162
in any case, an independent Southeast Asia is the 
result, which is stabilizing for

16:23.743 --> 16:39.162
everybody—India, China—is a result of the very 
painful ten years that America took and the

16:23.743 --> 16:39.162
South—people in the area took. It's not what—the 
way he meant it to happen, but the ten years had that

16:40.944 --> 16:48.973
result.

16:50.236 --> 16:56.803
Otherwise, of course, Lyndon Johnson is a major 
figure in the history of Asia. And that's what I had

16:58.144 --> 17:04.531
to go and talk at Hofstra in Vietnam, and I didn't 
particularly want to. I picked one point that's

17:04.551 --> 17:06.934
missed in all these history books. I said, I'm not 
going to debate all these old things again. But

17:11.779 --> 17:18.606
something you perhaps don't know, which is not 
only Lyndon Johnson's view of Asia, and Howe's

17:19.008 --> 17:23.452
position on Vietnam related to that. But Howe's 
decision related to his civil rights position.

17:30.699 --> 17:39.908
And he—it all ties into the convergence of his 
struggle for the 1957 Civil Rights Act and

17:30.699 --> 17:39.908
statehood for Hawaii. But I went into that little 
story.

17:44.892 --> 17:46.534
And he really had a sense how important the issue 
was going to be, and he didn't require a computer to

17:47.358 --> 17:53.947
calculate it, even an abacus, he could see. And he 
talked, I don't know, he looked at this passage in

17:55.129 --> 18:03.781
his East-West Center speech when he started out in 
66. But if there's a chance that

18:05.082 --> 18:16.318
it'll come out tolerably well, in that very 
limited sense I've just expressed But it may not,

18:17.598 --> 18:20.083
and he may not. And if it does, then another war has 
to be fought over the independence, because no one

18:20.804 --> 18:37.294
is going to let Southeast Asia be taken over by a 
major power, not China or Russia or India or U.S.

18:20.804 --> 18:37.294
And so if there's a real plunge for Thailand,

18:43.923 --> 18:45.930
I don't think the Russians know that. And the 
Russians have got a lot of problems, so it may not

18:46.071 --> 18:52.935
happen.

18:52.955 --> 18:53.798
Thank you very much.
