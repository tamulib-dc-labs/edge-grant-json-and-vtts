WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:05.344
And where were you born? In Rollins, Wyoming, on 
July 17, 1930. And where were your parents born? My

00:12.411 --> 00:18.898
mother was born in Hakona, in Michoacan, and my 
father in La Barca, Jalisco. My father in 1894, and

00:19.218 --> 00:25.724
my mother in 1900, but that must never be revealed. 
And she left Mexico, I believe. Now, I'm unclear as

00:29.512 --> 00:31.454
to the year. I think it was 1913. My father left in 
1919. And where did they meet? In my hometown of

00:39.144 --> 00:40.726
Rollins, Wyoming. My father was working for the 
Union Pacific Railroad at the time, and my mother

00:42.048 --> 00:53.342
had been widowed three years before she remarried 
my father. And I've just only learned that my

00:54.402 --> 01:02.552
father knew her while she was still married to her 
first husband, which is something I hadn't

00:54.402 --> 01:02.552
realized before. I would say roughly about 1925, I 
suppose, is when they met, and then we married in

01:02.612 --> 01:07.437
1929. I was the first born at that moment. Now, what 
was your mother's name? Guadalupe Navarro.

01:18.090 --> 01:21.574
Guadalupe Navarro.

01:22.347 --> 01:25.930
She was 13, let's see, she would have been 13 years 
old in 1913. Now, did she ever tell the story of how

01:25.950 --> 01:33.577
she and her family happened to leave Mexico? Yeah, 
I think that, first of all, her older brother had

01:33.597 --> 01:44.706
migrated to the United States a few years earlier 
and homesteaded a ranch in Wyoming. And then when

01:46.087 --> 01:51.392
the Revolution came with all the problems, rather 
than stay there with the violence, Apparently my

01:51.659 --> 01:56.725
grandmother decided to move to Wyoming where her 
son was. And so my mother, my grandmother, made a

01:56.745 --> 02:05.174
trip sometime before 1913 to come up to Wyoming and 
see what the situation was. Then she returned to

02:05.194 --> 02:14.905
Mexico and brought my mother and two of her 
grandchildren who had been born and abandoned by

02:05.194 --> 02:14.905
an elder daughter. And so the four of them made the 
trip home without us. And your grandfather was no

02:19.925 --> 02:21.887
longer living? No, my grandfather died in 1923, 
but my mother's grandfather separated from him

02:21.907 --> 02:29.896
for reasons which are unclear to me. But it's 
always struck me as a bit strange that she would

02:29.976 --> 02:37.824
leave her husband to go to her son. But it's not 
really strange because her husband, my mother's

02:37.844 --> 02:43.050
father, was her second husband. Her first husband 
had died. His name was Emiliano Javitegui. It's a

02:49.945 --> 02:55.492
is a Basque derivation, . Well, anyhow. So this was 
. Yeah. They met and married. Apparently, yeah. I

03:03.002 --> 03:05.506
know very little, very unclear.

03:08.270 --> 03:12.375
Then she married again, and- My mother was born to 
the marriage. Was it in 1913 that she left her

03:12.659 --> 03:17.445
husband to go to the States? Apparently so, yeah. 
Well, whatever happened to him, to your

03:18.126 --> 03:20.168
grandfather? He died in 1923, natural causes. 
What was his name? What was his name? I don't know

03:28.678 --> 03:29.679
his first name. His last name, I don't know. No 
father. Yeah. I'm sure my mother's told me I forgot

03:34.365 --> 03:36.728
him. But he stayed there in the church? Yes, yeah. 
And according to my mother, he stayed, I suppose,

03:40.368 --> 03:50.521
because he didn't want to play second fiddle to his 
eldest stepson, probably. But he apparently

03:51.122 --> 03:56.549
wasn't disturbed by the violence that was life in 
Mexico at the time. And mom says that he himself had

03:56.910 --> 04:00.455
experienced threats. One of the stories she tells 
about Mexicans, she has very little opinion of

04:00.475 --> 04:09.767
Mexicans, even though she was out there as 
although she's nationalized in Massachusetts,

04:10.237 --> 04:15.242
is that the violence was just unbelievable. That 
apparently,

04:16.063 --> 04:28.556
during the early phase of the revolution, she 
interposed with her body a pistol that was

04:16.063 --> 04:28.556
threatening her. And she doesn't like me being in 
El Paso because it's too close to Mexico and Mexico

04:28.576 --> 04:34.202
didn't believe that. And so I think this sort of 
indicates her attitude toward Mexico. It's one in

04:39.106 --> 04:43.132
which she sees violence everywhere. And this, you 
think, comes out of her experiences during the

04:43.152 --> 04:49.981
first two or three years of the revolution. She 
tells stories about la vistas y los casancistas.

04:58.874 --> 05:03.480
And I don't know if these are firsthand, because I 
get the idea that Villa and... and Carranza didn't

05:03.865 --> 05:07.950
have their fallout until after she left the 
country. No, they wouldn't have. Yeah, you see,

05:09.752 --> 05:16.419
and therefore, some of this may be hearsay, but 
anyhow, she tells about, you know, she recites a

05:09.752 --> 05:16.419
little poem to me. When the vistas would take the 
village, they'd say, are you vistas? And the poor

05:20.504 --> 05:25.309
people would say, well, we're neither vistas nor 
carancistas, just poor workers, you know. But

05:25.409 --> 05:29.434
there was a little rhyme, which sounds very 
enchanting in Spanish, which I've forgotten it.

05:30.275 --> 05:43.273
But this, I think, is the atmosphere that she 
conjures when she thinks of Mexico, and why she's

05:30.275 --> 05:43.273
reluctant to go back, and reluctant to have her 
children identify very much with Mexico, where

05:30.275 --> 05:43.273
Americans is what she's concerned. And she has 
never been back since 1913? No, she went back in

05:45.877 --> 05:47.359
19... When did I say her father died? 1923? Mm-hmm. 
Yeah. So she went back prior, a year or two before he

05:54.188 --> 05:56.772
died. That's the only business she's been in ever 
since. So it would be, she left in 1913, was back

05:59.234 --> 06:04.139
within 10 years, and has returned.

06:10.566 --> 06:18.454
And when I press her, you know, I myself really 
wasn't too concerned with my Mexican background

06:10.566 --> 06:18.454
until I suppose I was an adult. And when I do ask her 
questions,

06:24.562 --> 06:26.865
I was very young, and I don't remember. But these 
things do come out in informal conversations when

06:27.205 --> 06:31.550
she's not a daughter. For example, the reason Ed 
Leonard may have mentioned you to you was I

06:33.852 --> 06:48.208
remarked to him that at Christmas time, I got a 
letter from Mom that she was in El Paso in 1913,

06:33.852 --> 06:48.208
something like this. And apparently, on that 
trip, she relayed this at a different time. The

06:52.760 --> 06:57.724
train on which they were riding had been derailed 
or stopped for some reason. And so she and my

06:57.744 --> 07:03.970
cousins and my grandmother walked for several 
days. And she tells me about how my grandmother

07:04.891 --> 07:17.041
would put a handkerchief in pools of water they had 
collected so she could drink the water without

07:04.891 --> 07:17.041
getting the impediments that had been there. And 
that finally, they were rescued by Villa's troops

07:22.038 --> 07:37.367
to the extent that a cavalry detachment 
apparently came on them as they were walking

07:22.038 --> 07:37.367
across and directed them to a rail point at which 
there was a train waiting or was going to come and

07:22.038 --> 07:37.367
pick them up. And so her opinion of Villa is very 
high because she associates this cavalry

07:38.088 --> 07:43.118
detachment with them. And she tells the story of 
how my grandmother went to the captain of the

07:43.739 --> 07:47.871
detachment. My mother then was just obviously in 
her puberty. And told the captain that, you know,

07:51.221 --> 07:56.517
her daughter was, you know, she didn't want the 
soldiers molesting her. And the captain... let me

07:59.197 --> 08:03.403
know that she would not be molested, or he posted 
the guard. I can't remember who it was, you know, to

08:03.443 --> 08:12.035
prevent her from being molested, which is another 
reason that she could explain her high regard for

08:03.443 --> 08:12.035
the idea of being molested. But this is the sum 
total of my recollections from the millennium,

08:12.055 --> 08:24.192
except the recollection about how nice it was to 
have certain kinds of fruit in Mexico over the wine

08:12.055 --> 08:24.192
season, in this case. Now, what did your 
grandfather do in Hacona? What was his

08:30.271 --> 08:31.532
occupation? He was apparently a clerk, but a 
white-collar worker in a store. Now, Mom is very

08:36.158 --> 08:44.948
proud of her Spanish ancestry and says that he 
came, he apparently, I asked her point-blank

08:36.158 --> 08:44.948
whether he came from Spain. She didn't know, but 
she was always pointing out that he was, you know, a

08:45.008 --> 08:49.673
Spaniard. It's the wrong thing to admit to these 
days, but at that time, she's very proud to have it,

08:50.429 --> 08:55.995
still is. And she didn't know. She said that if he 
hadn't come over from Spain himself, he was the

08:58.958 --> 09:12.473
firstborn of parents who had come from Spain, in 
the same way I am the firstborn of parents who came

08:58.958 --> 09:12.473
from Mexico. But he was, apparently, a 
white-collar worker. She's always been very

09:15.185 --> 09:18.490
proud that he could read, write, calculate. She'd 
say, my father could add figures in his head. She

09:22.135 --> 09:30.607
was very proud of his occupation or his skill, 
which I suppose at that time was something to be

09:22.135 --> 09:30.607
proud of. My grandmother was uneducated, I think. 
So she doesn't talk about your grandmother's

09:37.497 --> 09:40.582
background? No. Apparently, my grandmother 
married I don't know why she married my

09:46.117 --> 09:56.849
grandfather, but apparently the big love in her 
life was her first life with Miñanito, because I

09:46.117 --> 09:56.849
can remember listening to Miñanito this, 
Miñanito that, you know, all the time I was growing

09:46.117 --> 09:56.849
up. I would never have messed with my own 
grandfather. And so I have a hunch that it must have

10:00.793 --> 10:10.204
been a marriage or something, you know, that she 
needed someone to help her raise a family or for

10:00.793 --> 10:10.204
financial reasons. Now, let's see, do I have your, 
your grandfather's name was? Navarro. Navarro.

10:16.759 --> 10:18.440
Oh, that's right. Navarro. Now, you may be 
confused because I said my grandmother's first

10:19.741 --> 10:23.885
husband was in How They Can Eat. Right. That's her 
first husband.

10:29.310 --> 10:32.453
Now, after going to Wyoming, what did your 
grandmother do? Apparently, she worked. She took

10:36.076 --> 10:36.957
in washing.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.863
She cooked in either a boarding house or a 
restaurant. I don't know. Until, I guess she did

10:46.141 --> 10:54.669
that until her own children had gotten jobs and 
were married and caught supporting her. And then

10:55.871 --> 11:09.064
she lived with their assistants until she died in 
1953, the age of 94 years.

11:09.104 --> 11:11.406
Now, your mother married... Her first husband. 
Her first husband. Who was he? His name was Manuel

11:15.064 --> 11:17.327
Ayala. He

11:17.467 --> 11:25.536
was also of Mexican descent, but I believe he was 
born in the United States. I'm not that sure. And he

11:28.479 --> 11:38.170
was, he worked on the railroad in the roundhouse, 
if that makes any sense to you. apparently helped

11:38.335 --> 11:42.259
keep the machinery in running order. I suppose a 
mechanic of sorts, I'm not sure what the technical

11:43.019 --> 11:46.623
name is. And this was shortly after she got to 
Wyoming? No, she married him in 1919. So it was a

11:53.109 --> 11:59.996
period of six years from the time she went home 
until she married at the age of 19. And she helped my

12:00.116 --> 12:02.998
grandmother take the Russians. Apparently she 
started schooling now. My grandmother took her

12:05.621 --> 12:07.903
out into third grade because She happened to be 
walking with a boy, and my grandmother thought

12:08.778 --> 12:20.550
this was something a young lady shouldn't do, so 
she pulled her out of school and kept her on the very

12:08.778 --> 12:20.550
close of her bed until she married her first 
husband. And she had four children by that

12:21.892 --> 12:23.694
marriage. Four children by that marriage. And 
then she married your father. Yes. Her first

12:30.481 --> 12:31.923
husband died. Died. He died in 1927 of... The 
physician who operated on him for tonsils

12:34.917 --> 12:39.204
apparently cut an artery. Yeah, that's right. My 
mother's first husband, probably her life died,

12:45.173 --> 12:54.527
and she's never found a way to replace him, even 
though she'd been married to him. Then she married

12:54.748 --> 12:59.836
my father, I think in 1929, and I was born in 30, and 
there were three children from that time. There

13:01.198 --> 13:02.680
were four children, and one of them died. What was 
your father's first name? Jesus Jose Gomez.

13:16.506 --> 13:17.528
And the children were? Me, Rudolph, and I had a 
younger brother named Ruben, and he had all the

13:18.208 --> 13:31.806
names that had been emphasized, you know, except 
my own in the birth certificate. Now, your father,

13:33.727 --> 13:38.811
Jesus, you say left Mexico in 1919. Yes. Where was 
he from? He was from La Barca in Jalisco. And? All I

13:44.616 --> 13:53.964
know about his background is that he, I think he was 
a woodcutter's son and a woodcutter himself in

13:44.616 --> 13:53.964
Mexico until the revolution came along. And then 
his activities during the revolution are very

13:54.085 --> 13:56.867
unclear. Now, I've heard rumors to the effect that 
he had a wife who was over in Mexico. and that either

14:03.477 --> 14:08.042
abandoned them or were separated from them from 
the revolution. I don't know. This is hearsay. But

14:10.064 --> 14:12.246
I have a hunch it's probably accurate, you know. 
And I hope there's never going to be another way to

14:12.786 --> 14:15.249
forgive me. But I have a hunch that it's accurate. I 
just, I don't know. And it's only been very

14:20.294 --> 14:28.202
recently that I know from a pretty reliable 
source, which is the first cousin, that

14:20.294 --> 14:28.202
apparently he was somehow supportive of Villa's 
effort in northern Mexico. But this is hearsay

14:34.595 --> 14:36.878
evidence. I don't know. I can recall my father 
talking with his friends also from Mexico about

14:38.560 --> 14:53.361
the revolution and talking about how they would do 
this, how to bury the dead and how they would be sure

14:38.560 --> 14:53.361
to take the shoes from the dead before they're 
buried and this kind of thing. But no account which

14:56.870 --> 15:02.677
could be historically accurate of what he did for 
those years of the revolution. I have a much better

15:03.758 --> 15:07.362
picture of what my uncle, Alveño, always did. He 
was one of Villa's men and was with Villa when they

15:07.863 --> 15:15.772
raided Columbus, New Mexico in 1950. This is your 
father's brother? My father's brother, Aurelio.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.683
A-U-R-E-L-L-I-O.

15:25.591 --> 15:34.328
And he was in the detachment that raided Columbus, 
New Mexico in 1950, and was also with Villa when

15:25.591 --> 15:34.328
they were being chased by Pershing. And he used to 
recount the story of how they surprised the

15:35.210 --> 15:44.608
American detachment and took their uniforms from 
them and returned them to the United States in

15:35.210 --> 15:44.608
their long underwear. And he says, you'll never 
read about that in an American history book. And

15:47.562 --> 15:56.431
the fact that he said this long before I was very 
prideful of my Mexican heritage leads me to

15:47.562 --> 15:56.431
believe it was probably an accurate statement. 
And it's true. I've never read about it in American

15:56.931 --> 15:58.753
history. No, I haven't either. But he said they did 
this. They caught this detachment, didn't want to

16:04.079 --> 16:05.981
kill them. They were in that trouble. Took the 
uniforms, the firearms, gave them their horses,

16:06.801 --> 16:14.109
and sent them back to town in their underwear, 
which would be hilarious. Yeah. So I have a hunch

16:15.068 --> 16:19.212
that he was probably one of Eden's regularers. But 
again, I didn't have enough presence of mine. I was

16:22.295 --> 16:23.036
very young. He died in 1943. I didn't have enough 
presence or enough sense of history to really

16:24.357 --> 16:29.822
probe. And so it's lost. It's terrible. Well, now, 
when did he come to? I presume this was in Wyoming?

16:37.710 --> 16:38.010
Yeah. He and my father worked together on Union 
Pacific Railroad. And I have a hunch they probably

16:41.774 --> 16:43.776
crossed My father, he and my father worked 
together on the railroad until, I suppose, my

16:46.186 --> 16:54.174
father married my mother. And then my Uncle 
Aurelio finally located in Longmont, Colorado,

16:54.234 --> 17:09.650
and worked there in the farms until 1941 or 42 when 
he contracted tuberculosis, or had been

16:54.234 --> 17:09.650
suffering from it anyhow. He came to Wyoming in 
1941. He was living with my father at the time of

17:12.172 --> 17:15.636
Pearl Harbor up there. This is how I dated. We all 
remember what happened on Joe Harmon. So he was

17:20.140 --> 17:28.351
living with my father in 1941, and he lived with him 
until he died in 1943.

17:29.733 --> 17:34.619
And as I say, by the time I knew him, he was a very 
gaunt man, very wasted. But I have a cousin who

17:34.679 --> 17:46.315
tells me that at the time he was working with my 
father and my uncle, my grandfather was

17:34.679 --> 17:46.315
distinguished by the fact that he was so tall. very 
strappy. But this was long before I knew either,

17:50.441 --> 17:55.128
long before I knew my father. Now your 
grandfather's on your father's side. No? Yes, I

17:58.933 --> 18:00.476
know nothing about him. I know his name. What's his 
name? Sin Poroso. I take that to be

18:07.265 --> 18:11.111
S-I-N-F-O-R-O-S-O. Sin Poroso Gomez.

18:15.918 --> 18:17.280
I know nothing about him. except that he was, I 
think, a woodcutter, because my father talked

18:18.290 --> 18:27.460
about going, taking the mule, and cutting wood, 
and coming back, and all this kind of stuff. I don't

18:27.480 --> 18:37.651
know a thing about my grandmother, except at one 
time, my father was very ill. She stole into an

18:27.480 --> 18:37.651
hacienda and stole some oranges from the trees. He 
would repeat this about how his mother really

18:38.192 --> 18:41.616
loved him. So I have a hunch there was a pretty hard 
life, much harder life for my father than for my

18:41.836 --> 18:48.043
mother. From for I believe to deduce that they were 
probably considered to be lower middle class. My

18:55.016 --> 18:56.920
father was just complete . But yet he was, I think, 
probably, he taught himself to read or was taught.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.739
He had some schooling because he could read 
Spanish. That's his book up there.

19:20.592 --> 19:27.243
And he cut himself to read the English newspapers 
at home so he could keep up with the news. But I

19:28.485 --> 19:31.951
thought I had a picture here. It was very strange to 
me that neither one of my parents spoke much of

19:32.692 --> 19:37.681
Mexico. Now, it may be that they've been away from 
it for so long. But then there was the usual racial

19:42.288 --> 19:45.133
prejudice in my hometown. And so it may have been 
that they

19:53.937 --> 19:56.720
How did your father happen to leave? Did he leave in 
any way because of the revolution or did he just

19:56.820 --> 20:01.606
leave?

20:04.689 --> 20:06.331
It's difficult to say. I think probably there's a 
combination of factors. I'm pretty well accepted

20:11.117 --> 20:15.962
in my own mind that my uncle Adrian wasn't a beast. 
And I think that my father was probably a vista of

20:16.212 --> 20:25.104
the camp followers riot, you know, cooking, this 
kind of thing, being a hostler or something. And

20:25.124 --> 20:31.353
when Villa had lost, you know, in Salaya in 1915, 
apparently there was this banding.

20:33.836 --> 20:34.677
Excuse me. Hi. Hey. Come on, let's go to class. Oh, 
excuse me, I'm... I just came by to see if you wanted

20:38.182 --> 20:39.764
to go today. Oh, well, thank you very much. No, I've 
got this. Hello, how are you? Hello. And... I think

20:47.633 --> 20:55.204
it was probably the culmination of the tumult in 
Mexico, the fact that he had been more or less

20:47.633 --> 20:55.204
active. Excuse me, would you like a mask? Please 
feel free. I think that may have had something to do

20:59.550 --> 21:03.076
with it. And

21:04.458 --> 21:16.375
the fact that there just wasn't anything 
economically that he could do in Mexico, and as you

21:04.458 --> 21:16.375
know, There's always been economic opportunity 
inside of the Rio Grande. And I think probably

21:23.007 --> 21:25.411
there's a combination of factors. But he never 
said, I left Mexico because. It was when I left

21:32.243 --> 21:35.308
Mexico. And it would be nice to go back and revisit 
this kind of thing. But now that he's gone. I've had

21:43.726 --> 21:45.268
a chance to reflect on all this. I'm the only member 
of my family who's ever gone to college, you see.

21:47.712 --> 21:54.263
And so a great deal of my interest is academic, you 
know, since I've been exposed to some of this

21:47.712 --> 21:54.263
myself. And I've puzzled over why they didn't talk 
about their background and their families,

21:54.363 --> 22:02.836
because it's a tremendous loss to us, not to know 
much about ourselves. And I've never been able to

22:02.857 --> 22:05.381
answer it satisfactorily for my father. For my 
mother, I think that she was very conscious of

22:05.441 --> 22:10.088
being an alien in Wyoming. wanted to make things as 
easy for us as possible, so she insisted that we

22:10.658 --> 22:24.077
speak English as quickly as we started in the 
library, that we assimilate as rapidly as

22:10.658 --> 22:24.077
possible, as she deprecated and downplayed our 
Mexican background, which I think is regrettable

22:10.658 --> 22:24.077
now. It's taken me 30 years to reach this point. But 
my father was self-consciously proud of being a

22:27.261 --> 22:30.005
Mexican. I can remember whenever anything 
favorable about Mexico came up, he would always

22:36.325 --> 22:37.967
bring to our attention in the newspaper. He would 
tune in to Spanish radio broadcasts, this kind of

22:38.028 --> 22:42.334
thing. I just don't know why he didn't speak with us 
about it. Part of the reason may have been that he

22:48.103 --> 22:52.610
and my mother didn't have a happy marriage. I 
mentioned to my uncle, I read him living in my

22:53.211 --> 22:55.815
father's house. They were separated practically 
all my life. And so it may have been that You know,

23:01.064 --> 23:04.608
when we were together, there were more immediate 
things to talk about in his background. I just

23:05.309 --> 23:06.190
don't know. I have often thought of going to Mexico 
and see if I have, you know, see if I could locate my

23:07.131 --> 23:12.257
family there. But I'm not half afraid to, you know, 
because I'm not sure I really want to know. Here I

23:16.643 --> 23:18.986
can romanticize and fantasize. It's probably 
much more appealing the truth would be. But I don't

23:23.311 --> 23:24.372
know. Now your father, he worked on the railroads. 
Was he still working? How long, when did your

23:30.784 --> 23:32.808
father die? He died in 1946. And was he still 
working on the railroads? No,

23:36.775 --> 23:43.766
he was working on the railroad as a section hand 
when he met my mother. But before that he had done,

23:44.748 --> 23:49.256
you know, the usual sorts of things that Mexican 
immigrants do. He had been a sheep herder. He had to

23:51.588 --> 23:54.272
pick beets in Colorado. He had worked in the 
agricultural field in Stockton, California. He

23:59.761 --> 24:01.725
had done some sort of work in Portland, Oregon. He 
worked on the railroad in Auburn, Utah, and was on

24:01.765 --> 24:06.292
the section in Wyoming where he met my mother. And 
then in the mid-'30s, he contracted Rocky

24:07.073 --> 24:10.760
Mountain Spotted Fever. And of course, it 
couldn't work, so he lost his job at the railroad.

24:13.304 --> 24:16.108
And at that time, they didn't have a workman's 
compensation. So he lost his job. And he was hired

24:18.470 --> 24:30.221
back by the railroad, I think in 1938 or 1939, 
without any credit given him for the seniority

24:18.470 --> 24:30.221
he'd already accumulated. So he was bitter about 
that. And during the war, he had an opportunity to

24:32.523 --> 24:40.851
work at the oil refinery in Rollins, Wyoming, or in 
Sinclair, Wyoming, which is seven miles from the

24:32.523 --> 24:40.851
hometown of Rollins. And he worked there from 1942 
until his death in 1946. And your mother, what did

24:49.030 --> 24:54.177
she do all these years when she was separated from 
your father? Did he support you? He supported us.

24:56.540 --> 24:57.201
She didn't work? She didn't work. She worked from 
the time her first husband died until she married

24:58.362 --> 25:04.610
my father. She worked as a janitor of a little 
school there, a little sophomore school. She took

25:09.797 --> 25:15.144
him washing and did, I suppose, what would be 
maid's work. But she finished that when my father

25:15.765 --> 25:18.328
died. or she quit that, apparently she married my 
father, and didn't work during their marriage.

25:26.481 --> 25:29.525
Now, during the time that he was ill, we were on 
welfare. And this probably explains the reason

25:30.986 --> 25:40.037
I'm a Democrat, and my father was a Roosevelt 
Democrat, because we were held by the Spanish

25:30.986 --> 25:40.037
program. And then she didn't work again until we 
had all left home. We were all, I suppose, trying to

25:45.464 --> 25:48.147
make our ends meet, And she worked for a while at the 
hospital there at home as a cook, this kind of

25:48.650 --> 25:57.239
thing. She remarried after my father died a third 
time, a man named Percy Sanchez, who was of Mexican

25:57.359 --> 26:15.417
descent, but he was born in Colorado, an American, 
served in the American Army during the First World

25:57.359 --> 26:15.417
War, and had a pretty good job for a Mexican 
American in that he was a founder of Hatchfield.

26:20.122 --> 26:20.483
Thank you. And he died, I can't remember, 1961, 62. 
Anyhow, my mother is, her major source of income

26:25.148 --> 26:34.398
today is his social security and whatever her 
children can send her to.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.025
Ah, now. Okay, well, I was saying

26:40.606 --> 26:45.471
that that you know, her major source of income is 
Social Security. And then, you know, I send her a

26:50.080 --> 26:53.884
contribution each month. I think several of her 
other children do. And then my sister lives in my

26:56.087 --> 27:04.236
hometown, and she makes the biggest contribution 
of all, which is looking after her, you know,

26:56.087 --> 27:04.236
taking care of her. How old is your mother now? 74. 
But she's not been in good health over the last four

27:07.840 --> 27:11.644
years. So I suppose what I'm saying is that her 
major source of money income is Social Security.

27:20.110 --> 27:26.803
The psychic income is from my sister, and then the 
in-between from the rest of the children, of which

27:20.110 --> 27:26.803
seven are surviving. You said you were the only 
one, seven. I hear that she only had seven. No, I

27:34.507 --> 27:38.432
said that she had four Gomez children, but the 
little girl died in 1934. I have a sister who died in

27:38.532 --> 27:41.076
1934. Oh, okay. She had four Gomez children. Four 
Gomez and four Ayala. One of the Gomez children

27:46.523 --> 27:51.329
died. And then your brothers and sisters, 
Rudolfo, that's you. Ruben, and how did you happen

27:56.676 --> 27:59.219
to go to college? You said you were the only one who 
had gone. I was only complete. I had an older

28:02.484 --> 28:03.585
brother who went. That was one of the Alaya. Ayala. 
Ayala. Yes. A-Y-A-L-A. I don't know. I've asked

28:13.490 --> 28:15.432
myself that question. It's just the luck of the 
draw. Some genes I got. My older brother got all the

28:19.277 --> 28:22.881
business genes in the family. He's a very 
successful realtor in Oregon. So it's genes I get.

28:29.808 --> 28:34.213
Well, you were talking about prejudice in 
Rollins, Wyoming. I don't have, in fact,

28:34.936 --> 28:42.087
Wyoming's one of the few states I've only been to a 
tiny bit. First of all, were there very many people

28:44.291 --> 28:47.916
of Mexican origin in Wyoming? Yes, uh-huh. Yes, to 
the extent my hometown, I think, probably the time

28:49.979 --> 29:01.758
I was born in 1930, the time I was first conscious 
of, the population probably varied from 4,000 to

28:49.979 --> 29:01.758
5,000 people. Even now, it's only 8,000, I think. 
But the entire south side of Rollins at the time I

29:04.366 --> 29:11.453
was growing up was Mexican, Mexican-American.

29:12.093 --> 29:17.778
And these were Mexicans primarily who had come 
over from old Mexico and settled. Because we made a

29:17.798 --> 29:20.901
distinction between, we called them suramacos. 
You're probably familiar with the term. This is

29:23.103 --> 29:26.927
people who came from Mexico to the United States. 
And los manitos, who were Mexicans from New Mexico

29:26.967 --> 29:33.613
or Colorado. who migrated to Rollins. So we made a 
distinction between Mexican-Mexican Americans

29:36.872 --> 29:42.697
and American-Mexican Americans. No, I don't 
think I've heard those terms, but that may be...

29:43.318 --> 29:47.882
Sudomato. S-U-R-U-M-A-T-O.

29:52.085 --> 29:54.607
And this is from a hacienda in Michoacán.

29:57.550 --> 30:00.933
And this is the name they gave themselves to 
indicate their Mexican origin. And Los

30:00.993 --> 30:03.195
Magnitos... There's a publication on Manico 
culture. And these are Spanish people who live in

30:07.068 --> 30:31.731
New Mexico and southern Colorado, who have been in 
the country probably for hundreds of years, and

30:07.068 --> 30:31.731
their descendants, perhaps, of Spanish and 
Indians, or perhaps are of Mexican lineage, but

30:07.068 --> 30:31.731
their forebears came over considerably before 
the Sudamatos, from whom I'm descended. Yeah, but

30:32.234 --> 30:34.277
it was perhaps in the late 19th century. Or early, 
you know, I don't know, you know, maybe the Mexican

30:34.978 --> 30:37.681
War. I just don't know, but I knew, though, that the 
distinction was made when I was growing up. And the

30:42.808 --> 30:52.762
most cutting thing we could say about another 
Mexican was that he was a manito, you see, because

30:42.808 --> 30:52.762
we wanted to indicate that we were really the best 
Mexicans because our parents had just come over

30:42.808 --> 30:52.762
from Mexico. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, it is. 
You know, we discriminated against ourselves

30:54.124 --> 30:58.630
amongst ourselves as well. You mentioned an 
hacienda in Michoacán as having given sura matos.

31:04.852 --> 31:05.012
Suru. The way I've got it spelled.

31:09.798 --> 31:10.379
It may be this. Yeah, this right here. Now, I got 
this information from a publication by Manuel

31:11.761 --> 31:17.608
Gamil. Are you familiar with some of his works? I 
think that's where I got it. Something I've read,

31:21.092 --> 31:26.999
though, explained the origin of this term, which I 
knew from the time I was very young, but I didn't

31:21.092 --> 31:26.999
know what it was. I just thought, You know, they're 
from Missouri, you know, from South Mexico. This

31:30.611 --> 31:31.112
isn't it. He says that this was from a hacienda. 
This is the name of a hacienda in Michoacán. And

31:35.697 --> 31:53.299
apparently it became

31:35.697 --> 31:53.299
a concept or a symbol to indicate the origin of 
these people in the United States who had come

31:35.697 --> 31:53.299
directly from Mexico rather than being of Mexican 
descent, you know, filtered through several

31:35.697 --> 31:53.299
generations who had lived in the country before 
them. Well, this is interesting because I've

31:53.339 --> 31:56.022
never picked up either one of these terms from East 
Texas or South Texas. There wouldn't be very many

32:01.243 --> 32:05.569
people from New Mexico. There would be Texans who 
were here, Tejanos who were here before the Texas

32:05.609 --> 32:13.160
Revolution, many of them. But I wonder, there may 
be a very real geographical difference here in the

32:13.741 --> 32:19.048
use of terms. Now, again, I wish I had the source at 
my fingertips. I think it's got me, but it may be

32:22.393 --> 32:24.255
somewhere else. But in the literature... There is 
the term, surumato, and they say it's from a

32:25.955 --> 32:30.781
hacienda in Michoacan. Now, this I've got from the 
literature. Someone has got, maybe it's Campa,

32:32.463 --> 32:37.469
Maynard Campa has done something about it. 
Someone, you know, it is in the literature. I was,

32:39.992 --> 32:43.235
well, I've already apologized for not being able 
to read the explanation. Well, what, how many of

32:43.496 --> 32:50.144
the people in your hometown were from Michoacan? I 
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We had, I

32:56.144 --> 33:12.643
suppose that we didn't have very many friends 
because my uncle's family was a large one and my

32:56.144 --> 33:12.643
mother's family, you know, and I suppose our 
primary friendship, my first memories of any sort

32:56.144 --> 33:12.643
of socialization with cousins, you know. But our 
friends, I suppose, were the Macias, who were also

33:12.663 --> 33:25.358
from Old Mexico,

33:12.663 --> 33:25.358
Los Canos from Old Mexico, I suppose these were the 
closest friends we had. I don't know where they

33:29.791 --> 33:38.984
were from, except that they were from old Mexico 
and maybe from where my parents came from. If you

33:39.946 --> 33:45.153
look at the map, it meets La Barca and Hacona aren't 
too far apart. No, they're not. Isn't Hacona where

33:47.336 --> 33:52.864
Cardenas loves it or Cardenas is from? I don't 
know. I don't know. There was no talk of kindness?

34:00.880 --> 34:02.482
Oh, my father, yes, yes. But no, not in a reasonable 
sense, you know. But kindness, you know, in my

34:06.087 --> 34:16.220
father's hierarchy of values would rank very high 
before I had any formal education at all. You know,

34:16.380 --> 34:19.324
kindness was present in the 34th and 40th, you 
know. I knew about him just as much as I knew about

34:19.743 --> 34:24.327
Abraham Lincoln. These were in my pantheon of 
heroes. And so my father, as I mentioned, was very

34:27.410 --> 34:36.458
prideful of his ancestry and background, and was 
extremely proud of what Cardenas had done. And I'm

34:37.479 --> 34:45.767
quite sure I may be intellectualizing and reading 
into the record something that wasn't there, but

34:37.479 --> 34:45.767
it seems to me that he was very proud of the 
expropriation. And any time the gringos got out,

34:45.787 --> 34:49.530
my father was very happy. And yes, there was 
knowledge, pride, even in Aleman, you know, just

34:50.405 --> 34:58.518
because he's a Mexican president. But not 
regional pride, but he may well have been from

34:59.680 --> 35:03.186
Michoacan. Oh, he was from Michoacan. I wasn't 
sure at the time. Your father kept up with events in

35:09.556 --> 35:12.360
Mexico. Did your mother pay any attention? 
Listen, I've... No, mom was sort of home,

35:16.831 --> 35:21.275
housewife-oriented. My father, my mother, 
again, this is probably post-facto research, has

35:21.295 --> 35:33.907
said that apparently, she said, well, you get your 
ability to speak in public from your father. And

35:34.347 --> 35:40.773
apparently, on Mexican holidays, they would have 
a gathering. My father would give talks, and other

35:40.813 --> 35:44.577
people would give talks. So I have deduced from 
this that he was illiterate in the formal sense,

35:45.046 --> 35:53.559
although he could read and write. But I would 
consider him to be sort of an intellectual in the

35:53.599 --> 36:07.780
sense of trying to place himself in a larger role, 
being aware of public events. Writing poetry, he

36:08.182 --> 36:29.616
wrote poems, love poems to my mother, which is 
something I suppose all of us do, but to have a man of

36:08.182 --> 36:29.616
that background, I think, indicates that he did 
have an interest in education, sympathy, which

36:08.182 --> 36:29.616
probably couldn't be said about a great many of his 
contemporaries. Your father was predominantly

36:31.165 --> 36:34.711
of Spanish background. No, no. My father was very, 
very dark, very Indian. He was very Indian. Was he

36:39.819 --> 36:41.261
Tarascon, perhaps? Or do you know what? I don't 
know. Here's a picture of my mother and my uncle

36:43.364 --> 36:45.668
Tony. You see? Mm-hmm. He's a Haute-A-Tahiti. 
They took off the Tahiti and made it

36:49.314 --> 36:54.582
Haute-A-Tahiti when he was in the United States. 
Wow.

37:01.490 --> 37:03.372
My father was very Indian. If there's someone... 
Now, look, this... Fine, thank you. Now, this is

37:16.625 --> 37:23.231
the only thing I have from my father's...

37:25.413 --> 37:31.159
These clippings and everything in here are his, 
and this sort of argument is the point I'm making

37:25.413 --> 37:31.159
about his interest. Was he actually from the town 
of La Barca, or was he from a rancho nearby? That

37:39.697 --> 37:41.740
might make a difference. I don't know. La Barca is 
all I know. I know that there are some towns there.

37:48.647 --> 37:50.429
Los Altos de Jalisco is near there. I just glimpsed 
this thing. Well, go ahead, if I find it all. I

37:59.219 --> 38:03.544
thought I had a small picture, which I had glued in 
here years and years ago. But no, he was not

38:03.584 --> 38:07.109
primarily Spanish. I think he was mestizo, 
obviously. And it was quite dark. But

38:15.098 --> 38:16.920
linguistically, fully Spanish. Oh, fluent. And 
he commanded it. As the Spaniards say, he was a

38:21.025 --> 38:24.369
dominio all the way. Spoke it very well. I'm 
curious about the manifestation of prejudice in

38:28.953 --> 38:35.179
Wyoming. Was it something that you sensed very 
greatly as a child? Yes, yes. We were all sent, you

38:38.642 --> 38:41.165
know, we had a Mexican school. Now, this was 
explained, this was geographic, but as quickly as

38:41.665 --> 38:51.055
we got to the fifth grade, you know, we all went to 
the central school. And...

38:54.738 --> 38:55.539
I don't know. I grew up hearing the dirty Mexican 
bit, the greaser. What else were some of the

39:00.387 --> 39:01.509
things? We all carried knives. All the 
stereotypes that you associate with prejudice

39:03.151 --> 39:08.219
were there. And we became very conscious at some 
early age, obviously, because I can remember

39:08.240 --> 39:21.100
being conscious of being Mexican all my life in a 
defensive sense.

39:26.041 --> 39:27.123
I don't know the source. He's the one who put it in. 
Did your family remain Catholic? Oh, yes. I am a bad

39:33.277 --> 39:41.014
one, but I'm

39:33.277 --> 39:41.014
Catholic. You know, it's stuff that a laborer... 
of that vintage wouldn't survive. Church

39:45.423 --> 39:48.286
situation throughout the states of Mexico. In 
other words, he was concerned with things. Yes,

39:51.389 --> 39:52.230
yes. And he was very proud of what the Revolution 
accomplished in the long run. Yeah, yeah. Did he

39:57.495 --> 39:59.417
ever think of going back to Mexico? No. He

40:01.439 --> 40:10.948
talked of going away from Wyoming, but he said he'd 
like to live in Ogden, Utah, or Stockton,

40:11.468 --> 40:21.139
California, or Portland, Oregon, each of these 
towns he had lived in in his younger days when he was

40:11.468 --> 40:21.139
with the railroad or something like this. But 
never talked about going back to Mexico. And I

40:24.602 --> 40:38.978
think that a great deal of the hesitancy that my 
family has in owning up to their Mexitanness comes

40:24.602 --> 40:38.978
from this instilling at a very early age on the part 
of my mother more than my father. somehow a reserve

40:39.093 --> 40:43.100
against Mexico, even though he's very proud of 
what they've done. He never said, I want to go back

40:43.120 --> 40:46.485
to visit. I don't believe it. He would fantasize 
about the food and the fruits they would have. But

40:51.594 --> 40:56.983
never going back for a visit, nor to live. Which 
leads me to believe that maybe he did have a family

40:57.385 --> 41:04.355
back then, you know, and would be reluctant to go 
back for that reason. Because he didn't, as far as

41:04.375 --> 41:09.923
you know, have the same kind of traumatic 
experience that your mother is a 13-year-old.

41:10.263 --> 41:12.947
It's easy to see how she would have that. Well, you 
see, at the time of the Revolution, he would

41:12.967 --> 41:16.492
already have been a young man. I suppose a man, 
given the standards of that age, he would have

41:16.532 --> 41:19.596
been... If you take 1910 as the starting point. He 
was younger than his brother, who was with Villa.

41:27.404 --> 41:31.348
And that's what would perhaps put him into this 
kind of camp following situation. I've deduced

41:32.409 --> 41:42.921
this for myself, both from my recollections and 
from what my cousins told me

41:32.409 --> 41:42.921
about him. It's very intriguing, and I don't want 
to pursue it much more, because I'm sure the truth

41:42.941 --> 41:49.127
isn't going to be as nice as my imagination. But I 
tried to give you a factual account of what I

41:49.715 --> 41:58.186
remember and not make them heroes of the 
revolution or anything like that. You talked

41:58.266 --> 42:04.334
about how you have not been to Mexico except 
Juarez.

42:04.994 --> 42:06.136
But you did live in South America. Yes, I lived in 
Lima. I was a Fulbright professor at the Catholic

42:07.177 --> 42:12.224
University in 1967. How did you feel about Peru? 
Well, I had ambivalent feelings about it. It was a

42:18.550 --> 42:20.873
tremendous professional opportunity. I enjoyed 
being in the Spanish culture for the first time in

42:20.893 --> 42:25.819
my life. It was very palpable. I enjoyed it. It 
forced me to renovate my own Spanish. I think the

42:34.589 --> 42:44.000
only reservation I had is I had my family with me, 
which were two young sons at the time, and my wife,

42:34.589 --> 42:44.000
who doesn't, you know, she can speak Spanish. She 
doesn't dominate it. And so I was constantly

42:46.499 --> 42:50.465
worried about little niggling details. I think 
had I been there by myself or just she and I there

42:50.505 --> 42:56.353
together, it would have been a much more enjoyable 
experience. But I think that professionally,

42:56.373 --> 43:00.679
intellectually, it really was a marvelous 
experience. But as a family man, as a concerned

43:01.200 --> 43:04.525
father, I wouldn't want to go back there under 
those conditions again. You know, how old were

43:07.570 --> 43:09.513
your sons then? Well, this picture was taken when 
they were in Lima. Clayton was four, and Bobby was

43:12.557 --> 43:15.961
nine. When we got back, he was ten. He was five. Now, 
I still haven't found out, except perhaps some

43:18.925 --> 43:25.032
genes, how you happened to get into college. How 
did you determine to go? I

43:26.594 --> 43:31.120
can't explain it. rationally, because there are 
so many things. I was always very conscious of

43:34.306 --> 43:43.035
being Mexican-American and resenting the fact 
that somehow other people were better than us. I

43:43.055 --> 43:46.498
suppose I was defensively aggressive, and still 
am to a certain extent. And I suppose in a certain

43:47.639 --> 43:52.604
amount of wanting to go to college was sort of a show 
them kind of thing. But then I always remember

43:53.324 --> 43:59.470
reading

44:03.314 --> 44:08.764
I had a library card in my hometown library when I 
was seven, eight years old. As quickly as I could

44:08.824 --> 44:10.427
get it, I had it. So I've always had sort of a

44:10.767 --> 44:17.740
bench for books. I've enjoyed it. And I think this 
had a great deal to do with it. I can't explain where

44:21.146 --> 44:23.210
did this come from. Where did you go to college? I 
began at the University of Wyoming. And then I

44:28.593 --> 44:31.638
transferred to Utah State University. And don't 
ask me why, because it's another one of those

44:31.658 --> 44:35.405
things I can't really explain rationally. Except 
that I was doing more drinking and running around

44:36.347 --> 44:42.998
and studying, and I wanted to get away from the 
crowd of boys who were high school buddies. How did

44:43.619 --> 44:44.661
you finance it? GI Bill. And I was a janitor at Sears 
and Roebuck for a couple of years. So when were you

44:50.712 --> 44:52.494
in the service? Korean War, 1950, 1954. And then as 
soon as you got out, you started college. GI Bill.

44:58.800 --> 45:01.863
But did you go straight on for a doctorate? Yes. I 
finished my undergraduate

45:02.884 --> 45:09.710
in three years, three and a half, third years. And 
then I got a fellowship at Stanford. I got my

45:13.494 --> 45:14.935
master's at Stanford. And I got a fellowship 
there, but unfortunately no waiver of tuition, so

45:15.860 --> 45:21.107
I had to get some financing. By this time I was 
married and had a boy. Where's your wife from?

45:24.953 --> 45:27.256
She's from Ohio. And she's... She's a gringa. 
She's a gringa. And then I got my PhD here in

45:32.463 --> 45:35.027
Colorado. So it's working all the way through 
until... until graduate school. And then in

45:41.656 --> 45:44.280
graduate school I got a very good... fellowship 
first year as a Wilson, you know, not the school.

45:49.658 --> 45:51.160
The Ford Foundation had to move the business. I 
hadn't moved well. And then I got the fellowship

45:53.264 --> 45:59.814
years at Colorado and the teaching 
assistantship. And so that financed my way

45:59.834 --> 46:01.777
through. I'm really very fortunate, you know, all 
the way through by having help, you know, from the

46:02.698 --> 46:09.989
government and then, you know, the people who gave 
me jobs. There was a, if there's one
