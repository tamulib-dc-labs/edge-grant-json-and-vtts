WEBVTT

00:03.153 --> 00:22.336
North Korea, China, and Cuba was greatly enhanced 
by the demonstration of total freedom that those

00:03.153 --> 00:22.336
people demonstrated throughout the world. And I 
don't think it's going to be long until North Korea

00:22.356 --> 00:32.788
and China and Cuba, the Communist parties, will 
lose power.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.447
Why do you feel that the anti-war activists were 
against the war? Well, I say, I don't think they

00:43.467 --> 00:45.250
were against the war. They were against 
everything. There was what was called a Chicago

00:47.453 --> 00:52.041
Five. I don't remember all of them. Jerry Rubin was 
one of the major ones. But they were a group of

00:58.712 --> 01:04.581
hippies that really was the leadership in all the 
drug experimentation and so forth and there was a

01:06.299 --> 01:34.163
professor who's still out at the university of 
california the lsd king i forget yeah leary

01:06.299 --> 01:34.163
timothy o'leary although i think he was at the 
school in boston at that time he subsequently

01:06.299 --> 01:34.163
moved to california they were a group of people 
that was against everything and the war just

01:06.299 --> 01:34.163
happened to be there and if it hadn't been a war they 
would have been against something. Now, I

01:37.728 --> 01:48.577
attended some congressional hearings while 
these people were being questioned. And they're

01:48.597 --> 01:51.720
absolutely the scum of the earth. You would not 
believe how they were. And like I say, they were

01:58.105 --> 02:00.007
against everything. Now, there were some people 
there who truly were against They thought the

02:04.467 --> 02:07.150
United States was wrong. And these people I have no 
problem with. They have a right to believe one way

02:12.696 --> 02:17.141
or the other. But my judgment is that was probably 
10 or 15%. The rest of them were professional

02:21.927 --> 02:29.615
antagonists.

02:29.636 --> 02:31.858
They were against everything.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.242
And this was just a good cause. They were not 
employed. I don't know how they supported

02:39.726 --> 02:42.369
themselves. There certainly was no significant 
economic support base for these people. A lot of

02:52.080 --> 02:57.526
the rock music was getting to be big, big things. 
And they were having big, well, I think Woodstock

02:57.546 --> 03:04.174
was one of them. But this is where they gathered 
their people from. They were able to get a group of

03:09.464 --> 03:12.388
people. And college students always have been and 
always will be very easy to get emotionally

03:14.011 --> 03:22.663
involved in things. Fortunately, we've always 
managed to get this emotional energy involved in a

03:23.484 --> 03:29.773
positive direction.

03:32.555 --> 03:40.383
And as a result of that, much good has been done by 
the youth of this country over the years. But when

03:41.184 --> 03:51.655
you get the wrong leaders

03:41.184 --> 03:51.655
involved like they did at that period of time, they 
can be a tremendous force. Large numbers of

03:52.837 --> 03:58.903
people, rather than being drafted, went to Canada 
and other places. But Canada was the primary place

03:58.963 --> 04:02.427
that avoid the draft. But it was just a situation 
where we had leadership

04:07.350 --> 04:27.378
that could take advantage of the emotion of the 
youth that were simply leading them in the

04:07.350 --> 04:27.378
anti-war direction because there just happened 
to be a war.

04:30.843 --> 04:33.527
How'd you feel about soldiers that came back and 
started becoming involved with the anti-war

04:34.790 --> 04:38.756
movement? Well, there again, particularly, you 
know, there are young men we're talking about

04:38.776 --> 04:44.384
here. Well, first of all, some of them truly 
believed that what we were doing was wrong. And

04:53.737 --> 04:59.706
their experience may very well have been a very bad 
experience. You know, I told you to begin with.

05:02.313 --> 05:04.816
This sort of thing is a very subjective thing. Now, 
nothing that I was involved with while I was in

05:05.717 --> 05:12.905
Vietnam was bad. There were no atrocities where my 
unit was involved with. We did not treat the people

05:23.377 --> 05:25.159
badly. I had absolutely no reason whatsoever to 
come back here and not feel pride in having done a

05:31.675 --> 05:40.884
good job and having done what our government 
wanted us to do. Now, if I had been in an outfit like

05:40.904 --> 06:01.665
was involved in some of these massacres, like 
Lieutenant Kelly, I'm sure you've read about

05:40.904 --> 06:01.665
this, but probably don't know the full extent of 
it, then yeah, I probably could have been coaxed

06:02.928 --> 06:10.096
into demonstrating against the United States 
because that was bad. And so anyone that was

06:10.937 --> 06:27.254
involved in bad

06:10.937 --> 06:27.254
situations was going to be very likely

06:10.937 --> 06:27.254
subject to being recruited into the anti-war. I 
read General Schwarzkopf's. novel, not novel,

06:31.413 --> 06:33.556
autobiography. I don't know whether you read it or 
not. But he was a battalion commander about the

06:36.441 --> 06:40.627
same time that I was. And he talked in not very 
flowery terms about the condition of the

06:41.649 --> 06:49.421
battalion that he was in. It was bad. And he said so. 
It had bad leaders. And the people probably were

07:00.691 --> 07:03.115
involved in some bad things. So I can understand 
how a young private who spent a year in a situation

07:03.675 --> 07:14.110
like that would have come back very demoralized. 
And I don't mean that as a slap at the Army, OK?

07:20.359 --> 07:29.753
Because the Army had to mobilize from a relatively 
small force with worldwide responsibilities.

07:32.247 --> 07:44.220
into a very large force who still had its worldwide 
primarily European responsibilities and then

07:32.247 --> 07:44.220
still had to provide a large force for Vietnam. As a 
result of that, I believe Gerald Schwarzkopf

07:44.741 --> 07:55.573
indicated that he only had two or three NCOs in his 
entire battalion that had combat experience.

07:58.877 --> 07:59.858
His officers were were very inexperienced. Now 
you take the battalion I was in now. We had staff

08:07.832 --> 08:13.762
NCOs, many of which had Korean experience. I had 
been to Korea.

08:18.389 --> 08:22.194
I guess I was the only officer that had Korean 
experience. I can't recall. Yeah, I'm sure I was.

08:26.661 --> 08:27.162
But My company commanders, platoon commanders 
and so forth, were top quality.

08:35.870 --> 08:41.477
As a result of that, we didn't have disciplinary 
problems. We did not have problems with dope,

08:42.219 --> 08:50.230
which General Schwarzkopf wrote about, which 
many other people have talked to me about. We

08:51.852 --> 08:54.716
didn't have all those problems. And as a result, 
Not only was my experience a positive one, but the

08:56.369 --> 09:03.380
experience of the troopers were positive. So I 
would be shocked if any of them were involved at our

09:03.400 --> 09:09.409
war movement. But the other young people who had 
lesser quality experiences, yeah. You see, I left

09:17.862 --> 09:22.950
there and went to Army staff in the Pentagon. My 
contemporaries there were Army officers. And the

09:28.217 --> 09:38.248
experiences that they shared with me

09:28.217 --> 09:38.248
were quite similar to what General Schwarzkopf 
said about his unit. And when I would relate my

09:39.429 --> 09:44.815
experiences to them, they couldn't believe it. 
They would tell me about the so-called fragging

09:47.598 --> 09:52.043
that used to go on. We didn't have any problems like 
that.

09:57.630 --> 10:06.743
We talk about the discipline where our lack of 
discipline, where young soldiers would refuse

09:57.630 --> 10:06.743
orders. We didn't have that sort of stuff.

10:11.750 --> 10:21.304
And like I say, one of the reasons that the Army had 
this problem is they had to expand so quickly They

10:21.925 --> 10:30.416
had to take so many draftees that their training 
base did not allow them to train these people

10:21.925 --> 10:30.416
properly. They were not able to provide enough 
experienced officers and non-commissioned

10:32.519 --> 10:42.912
officers to the units in Vietnam. And as a result, 
it was often terrible, absolutely terrible. Like

10:49.420 --> 10:50.802
I said, fortunately, we didn't I'll bet you that 
half of the staff NCOs in my battalion were on their

10:52.385 --> 11:04.520
second tour in Vietnam and many of them on their 
third tour.

11:08.164 --> 11:14.812
So they knew what was going on and so forth. But a lot 
of that has to do with leadership from the top. Now,

11:21.340 --> 11:22.341
when I say the top, Really, I think the last level of 
command that has a direct influence on the soldier

11:23.317 --> 11:37.017
or Marine is the battalion commander. The 
regimental brigade or division commander, he'll

11:38.018 --> 11:51.417
have some influence over the battalion 
commander, but first of all, never is going to get

11:38.018 --> 11:51.417
around the troopers.

11:52.358 --> 12:01.346
I think that because we had fewer commitments 
worldwide than the Army did, we were able to have a

11:52.358 --> 12:01.346
higher quality battalion commander. Now, just as 
an example, I recall I had sent a patrol one day out

12:03.448 --> 12:20.543
through this village and they had to They were to go 
out about 10 or 12 kilometers and come back. And

12:26.215 --> 12:31.421
this was a platoon-sized patrol, about 40 men. As 
they were going through this village, for some

12:31.441 --> 12:38.950
unknown reason, they passed this Buddhist 
temple. And they started breaking the cups and so

12:40.092 --> 12:49.483
forth, cups and saucers that were on the outside of 
this temple.

12:50.442 --> 12:56.030
The lieutenant who was in command of the platoon 
didn't stop him. Well, the word got back to me as to

12:56.050 --> 13:00.537
what happened. And I made him buy plates and 
saucers to replace. It cost him $250 to replace

13:06.165 --> 13:09.810
them. And so the word gets out, not only can you not 
kill innocent people the way They were in some

13:20.193 --> 13:21.235
places. You can't even destroy their property, 
because if you do, this guy's going to make you pay

13:21.555 --> 13:31.269
for it.

13:31.289 --> 13:45.410
And when you control troops, when they do what you 
want them to and do not do the wrong thing, well,

13:31.289 --> 13:45.410
first of all, you never have any massacres. You 
don't kill innocent women and children.

13:54.078 --> 14:00.846
It's just a matter of respect for being in one's 
country and so forth. And I just don't think many

14:00.866 --> 14:04.890
Army units had experiences like that. And I say 
this because, like I say, I was stationed with them

14:07.193 --> 14:19.967
after I left, and they

14:07.193 --> 14:19.967
just couldn't believe that that we operate this 
way and they operate it in a totally different

14:21.905 --> 14:25.430
manner.

14:31.597 --> 14:35.422
What types of training did you have to go through in 
order to work in civil disturbances? Well, there

14:37.144 --> 14:42.171
wasn't any, you mean for me personally, there was 
nothing. You know, they just, I had orders to go to

14:42.431 --> 14:50.882
headquarters Marine Corps and I don't even 
remember now what branch I was scheduled to go to.

14:51.453 --> 14:54.376
And the day I got there, they said, no, you're not 
going there. You're going to go and be on the Army

14:55.577 --> 14:58.180
staff. I said, why me? Well, they give me this cock 
and bull story about all my qualifications. And I

15:04.367 --> 15:06.809
finally told them, I said, this is a bunch of BS. Why 
am I going over there? They said, they want someone

15:08.992 --> 15:12.576
right now, and you're the first one coming in. So we 
got through all this qualification bit. And I was

15:17.701 --> 15:21.325
just an able body to go over there and represent the 
Marine Corps. Of course, by the same token, at this

15:23.974 --> 15:49.562
point I had 20 years in the Marine Corps, so I was 
completely familiar with all of our organization

15:23.974 --> 15:49.562
capabilities and so forth, and I had served in 
many, many positions, so I was able to help in the

15:23.974 --> 15:49.562
planning that we had to do. Now, as far as the people 
that we utilized in civil disturbances, we did put

15:52.692 --> 16:20.910
them through riot control training

15:52.692 --> 16:20.910
and lots of other things because the idea when 
you're involved in this sort of thing is to

15:52.692 --> 16:20.910
accomplish your mission without using any more 
force than was absolutely necessary.

16:23.945 --> 16:38.545
Also, we were involved in the training, testing, 
and monitoring of all your National Guard and

16:23.945 --> 16:38.545
Reserve units at the time. And that's what took up 
most of our efforts, was trying to see that they

16:41.208 --> 16:48.758
were ready to do it. See, there's a law in the United 
States called Posse Comitatus Act, which says, in

16:54.134 --> 17:12.997
effect, that regular forces cannot be used to 
enforce the law, except when the governor of a

16:54.134 --> 17:12.997
state tells the president, I need help. Now, the 
basis of that is good. It's to keep the armed forces

17:15.740 --> 17:22.048
from being used in any way which could maybe give 
them an insight as to how to take over the

17:22.872 --> 17:28.378
government?

17:28.398 --> 17:32.804
Now, the irony of it is that the Marine Corps is 
exempted from that act. So actually, Marines can

17:33.965 --> 17:42.735
be used in a law enforcement mode, whereas the Army 
cannot.

17:46.640 --> 17:52.727
But fortunately, the requirement was on the wane. 
by the time I got there. We thought it was going to

17:54.752 --> 18:03.822
get worse, but actually we had already seen the 
worst part of it by the time I got to Washington. Did

18:03.842 --> 18:10.289
your training change or how did it change over the 
three years that you worked in civil

18:03.842 --> 18:10.289
disturbances? The training that soldiers went 
through to work? Yes, it did. The emphasis was on

18:16.716 --> 18:20.841
riot control. And it was how to move various 
formations that would be used to move a group of

18:22.441 --> 18:32.593
people out of an area. A wedge, for instance. A 
wedge is the way you split a piece of wood. Well,

18:38.519 --> 18:47.149
that's the way you break up a group of rioters or 
demonstrators, is you split them into more

18:48.563 --> 18:53.609
usable, not usable, but controllable size 
groups. The use of tear gas and other things, the

18:53.689 --> 19:02.439
billy club, non-deadly force was stressed. But 
almost everything else that a soldier or a Marine

19:03.180 --> 19:18.537
does in his regular training is also quite usable 
in civil disturbances. But one of the basic

19:19.563 --> 19:28.833
mistakes and the most,

19:19.563 --> 19:28.833
well, I'm looking for a word. I can't find it. But on 
Kent State, I don't know whether you've read

19:29.514 --> 19:32.918
anything on that or not. Now, this was National 
Guard. This was not Army. This was National Guard.

19:38.304 --> 19:39.686
Forces were used there. The truth of the matter is 
they panicked. And they started shooting live

19:43.210 --> 19:48.996
ammunition at demonstrators. That should never 
happen. But it goes back to the basic problem that I

19:51.840 --> 20:18.966
discussed earlier, and that is the fact that the 
Army and its extension as the National Guard was

19:51.840 --> 20:18.966
poorly, poorly trained, poorly organized, 
poorly led to the point of almost being criminally

20:19.975 --> 20:26.564
You have to realize, though, how a National Guard 
works. And I want to be quick to say the National

20:27.145 --> 20:35.697
Guard today is 20 times better than it was then.

20:36.859 --> 20:38.401
And each state is different. But I don't think 
there was a single state that could say theirs was

20:38.421 --> 20:44.289
good then or that was properly led. It was 
politically led. These people, a large

20:49.591 --> 20:58.243
percentage of the people and all of the leadership 
were politically appointed. For instance, it

20:58.263 --> 21:16.830
wouldn't be unusual at all to find the adjutant 
general, who is the commander of the state's

20:58.263 --> 21:16.830
National Guard, to have been a captain in the Guard 
one day, and the right governor takes over, and the

20:58.263 --> 21:16.830
next day he's a major general in the Guard. Well, 
just because you pin stars on his shoulder doesn't

21:18.363 --> 21:28.779
make him any more qualified today than he was 
yesterday when he had captain's bars on his

21:18.363 --> 21:28.779
shoulder. Quite the contrary, he probably was a 
pure politician or he wouldn't have had that kind

21:28.799 --> 21:36.892
of pull with the government. The National Guard 
then, and they were the first line of defense, was

21:36.912 --> 21:41.899
terrible. There's no other way to state it. They 
were terrible. They were ill-equipped,

21:47.624 --> 21:58.876
ill-trained, ill-organized, and it was just a bad 
scene. And in Kent State, there were several

21:59.457 --> 22:01.839
people killed. And it was demonstrated to a lesser 
degree numerous times throughout. The National

22:10.188 --> 22:11.910
Guard has improved vastly.

22:15.400 --> 22:22.487
Did your views on Vietnam change when you were 
there the first time in 67 to when you participated

22:15.400 --> 22:22.487
in the evacuation in 75? No. I believe that we were 
there. Now, when I say we, I was there as a Marine.

22:35.440 --> 22:38.663
Now, why we as a nation was there, that's another 
matter. And you need to keep that in perspective. A

22:44.307 --> 22:51.815
professional military man is there and doing 
something because his commander in chief told him

22:44.307 --> 22:51.815
to.

22:54.799 --> 22:58.683
And he doesn't have to agree totally with his 
commander in chief. He just has to do what he's

22:59.324 --> 23:04.569
told.

23:04.589 --> 23:09.835
I believe that our reason for going there was 
honorable.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.280
I believe that there were truly political 
mistakes that were made.

23:23.164 --> 23:25.267
There were military mistakes that were made.

23:28.693 --> 23:41.533
But anyone who waits until he finds a perfect 
situation before he is involved will never be

23:28.693 --> 23:41.533
involved in anything.

23:45.698 --> 23:47.800
I believe we were right being there. I believe we 
did a professional job. I believe that the

23:53.126 --> 24:02.918
decisions to restrict military activity was a 
political decision. I believe those decisions

24:04.760 --> 24:07.603
should be political. And when the political 
decision is made by the commander in chief, and he

24:16.765 --> 24:23.375
says, this is what we're going to do, then it is the 
job of the military to do it. And it should always be

24:23.395 --> 24:25.638
that way. The military should never, ever, ever be 
the controlling factor. They should never, ever,

24:34.211 --> 24:39.559
ever make political decisions. They should 
always be consulted and asked for advice, but they

24:39.579 --> 24:46.249
should never, ever make political decisions. 
That's how you get a Russia.

24:53.352 --> 24:56.955
That's how you get several other communist 
countries.

24:59.517 --> 25:02.921
No, to answer your question, my view did not 
change. I went back there in 1975 under orders of

25:03.881 --> 25:10.267
the command in chief to evacuate those people. We 
did a good job. I would not do it differently. I felt

25:16.925 --> 25:18.927
proud the first time I left there. I felt proud the 
second time I left there. We did what we were told to

25:22.492 --> 25:28.979
do with the absolute minimum loss of life. And when 
you can walk away saying we've done the job and we

25:30.121 --> 25:40.553
have lost the absolute minimum number of people, 
then you have no reason to be anything other than

25:30.121 --> 25:40.553
proud.

25:44.161 --> 25:47.085
Describe your role in the evacuation of Saigon and 
Laos. Well, my role in Laos was strictly one of

25:47.966 --> 25:55.595
being a reserve battalion.

25:58.498 --> 26:00.481
I was not called upon. We stayed aboard the 
aircraft carrier ready to go, but we were not

26:00.641 --> 26:07.169
needed. My role in the evacuation of Saigon was 
that I was to go in and occupy the location where the

26:14.603 --> 26:26.038
CIA had operated out of.

26:26.058 --> 26:33.287
Another battalion was to go into the embassy, and a 
third battalion was to be the reserve. We were

26:34.669 --> 26:38.253
getting ready to launch. I already had one company 
that was airborne. I was in the helicopter myself

26:40.837 --> 26:44.121
and was getting ready to lift off. And the pilot 
said, hey, the captain wants to see you. We've been

26:50.558 --> 26:52.860
told to stand down. Well, the bottom line was the 
CIA area, which was called Air America, that was

26:52.880 --> 27:05.512
their cover, had been lost to the North 
Vietnamese. And so the choice had to be made,

27:07.254 --> 27:11.678
either we're going to not use that as an evacuation 
point, or I was going to have to go in there and

27:12.097 --> 27:19.347
retake it. In other words, I was going to have to 
make an assault on the plane. Well, the decision

27:24.354 --> 27:29.321
was made that we would not do that, and it was a good 
decision. I don't take exception to that. So there

27:31.143 --> 27:41.918
again, I sat as the reserve battalion aboard the 
aircraft carrier Hancock waiting to go in if

27:42.556 --> 28:11.213
needed and i did not go in so my participation was 
strictly one of handling the evacuees as they come

27:42.556 --> 28:11.213
back to the ship that i was on now i had troops on two 
other ships and i did have one platoon which was

28:13.032 --> 28:36.434
airborne the entire time as just a ready reserve 
that could go in in the event a helicopter went down

28:13.032 --> 28:36.434
or something, that they could go in and secure the 
site until whatever additional evacuation was

28:13.032 --> 28:36.434
necessary. But

28:37.234 --> 28:41.318
we took care of them. people as they came back and 
that was the full extent of it. So I was just a

28:45.779 --> 28:54.006
reserve battalion in both of those operations. 
Describe your feelings about the evacuation and

28:54.046 --> 29:02.974
if it was a defeat for the Marine Corps. Oh, 
definitely not a defeat. We come out of there under

29:06.877 --> 29:11.001
orders.

29:13.124 --> 29:28.019
And I might add that if you looked at that 
operation, if you studied that operation,

29:13.124 --> 29:28.019
I would say that there was one mistake made. And 
that was one of

29:30.101 --> 29:40.752
a pilot who had been, again,

29:41.744 --> 29:47.051
an aircraft that was on standby in the event 
another aircraft went down.

29:50.075 --> 29:57.265
That crew had been airborne over 12 hours on that 
particular day. And fortunately, we had not lost

29:58.767 --> 30:01.631
any other aircraft. Not another aircraft had gone 
down. So he had been simply a standby aircraft for

30:04.295 --> 30:08.120
12 hours. He had landed two or three times to 
refuel. He'd come back out to the ship to land and

30:11.697 --> 30:14.480
refuel. But other than that, he'd been airborne.

30:18.945 --> 30:24.370
And, oh, I guess it was an hour after dark. I don't 
remember when the operation had, in fact, been

30:24.490 --> 30:31.117
completed. He was coming back in to our carrier to 
land. And he simply drove that helicopter into the

30:38.360 --> 30:46.491
city. And the pilots have a term for this. They 
understood what happened.

30:56.444 --> 31:00.289
He was fixed on the lights of the carrier. And after 
a while, your eyes fool you is what he came out to do.

31:07.992 --> 31:17.304
He truly thought he was landing on the aircraft 
carrier, and he drove it into the water about 400

31:07.992 --> 31:17.304
yards off him. And even though that helicopter was 
supposed to float, it went down like a sea anchor,

31:17.325 --> 31:26.597
and all four men were killed. Now that was the...
