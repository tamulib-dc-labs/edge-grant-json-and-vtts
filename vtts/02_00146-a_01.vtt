00:03.085 --> 00:09.916
This is testing on the 21st of June to see if this machine is working and this mic is working.

00:10.537 --> 00:11.678
One, two, three.

00:15.725 --> 00:19.851
This is now to see if mic this is working.

00:19.891 --> 00:22.235
Three, two, one.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.418
Three, two, one.

00:26.947 --> 00:28.409
Testing one, two, three.

00:28.589 --> 00:29.890
Testing one, two, three.

00:29.950 --> 00:44.106
This is June the 21st, and we're in the Dean's conference room at the College of Veterinary Medicine, and we're going to check and be sure that both mics are working.

00:46.709 --> 00:49.032
I have the honor of chatting with Dr. J.D.

00:49.072 --> 00:49.593
McCrady.

00:49.633 --> 00:54.338
Today we want to concentrate on his student experiences.

00:54.858 --> 01:09.994
J.D., to begin with, to help anybody who would listen to this or read it in the future, describe where you grew up and where you lived, went to high school, what your family did, get us ready to get you coming to A&M.

01:11.436 --> 01:21.186
Well, I was born in Beaumont, Texas in 1930 and my father was with Mobile Oil Company and my mother was a

01:21.166 --> 01:29.059
and I had two brothers, one 18 months younger and one 14 years younger.

01:30.842 --> 01:43.442
I went to school at South Park High School in Beaumont and finished high school in 48 and entered Texas A&M in the fall of 48.

01:44.524 --> 01:46.667
As you look back on those years,

01:47.440 --> 01:53.568
What was the reason or reasons that caused you to think about coming to Texas A&M instead of some other school?

01:54.790 --> 02:06.967
Well, I guess your football coach or people like that have a great influence on your life.

02:09.130 --> 02:15.118
Both two of my football coaches were A&M graduates and had played here on the national championship.

02:16.634 --> 02:33.974
team, and I had offers to go to several other schools, but they thought that A&M was a place I would enjoy, since I loved the outdoors and such as that.

02:35.436 --> 02:42.304
And so through my head football coach, Phoebe Fithian,

02:42.284 --> 02:51.607
He contacted Harry Steitler at Texas A&M and they in turn contacted me and I came to A&M.

02:51.627 --> 02:55.336
Did you come to visit the campus your senior year?

02:55.978 --> 02:56.479
No.

02:56.999 --> 02:59.883
We didn't do that kind of thing.

02:59.903 --> 03:01.605
Did anybody come to call on you?

03:01.685 --> 03:02.126
Yes.

03:02.686 --> 03:03.467
Who came down there?

03:03.588 --> 03:04.349
Coach Steitler.

03:05.390 --> 03:16.845
But those days, a 160-mile trip was a long, enduring trip to take.

03:17.826 --> 03:21.611
Did Coach Steitler promise you anything?

03:21.751 --> 03:26.297
What did he say about A&M and your role at A&M?

03:26.834 --> 03:29.019
Well, it was interesting.

03:31.304 --> 03:38.160
At that point in time, of course, recruitment was something that

03:38.562 --> 03:48.118
these coaches did, but it wasn't, it wasn't nearly as high-pressured as it is now.

03:48.178 --> 03:57.654
It was just that they came and talked to you and wanted to know if you were interested in education and the chance to participate.

03:57.854 --> 04:02.983
And that, that day and time, you didn't sign letters of intent or anything.

04:03.740 --> 04:10.013
You weren't married to the university until you played in your first football game.

04:10.875 --> 04:17.789
And there weren't any movies of the game, so did he ever see you play?

04:18.130 --> 04:18.371
No.

04:18.792 --> 04:24.263
They just took the words of your coaches and

04:24.243 --> 04:29.849
if you, you know, were on an all-district team or something like that.

04:29.909 --> 04:37.096
And what position did you play and what status did you have in the all-district and all-regional and so forth?

04:37.196 --> 04:44.523
Well, I was, and for my day, I was rather large.

04:46.325 --> 04:49.508
I weighed 200 pounds, yet I was...

04:50.804 --> 04:56.031
The coach from the University of Houston, I can't remember his name.

04:56.872 --> 04:58.454
I was playing defense.

04:58.474 --> 04:59.556
We played both ways.

04:59.656 --> 05:01.959
I was playing defensive and offensive tackle.

05:03.141 --> 05:13.875
And also, I played baseball and I ran on track team and lots of other things, as everybody did back in those days.

05:15.053 --> 05:18.316
had turned out to be a fair quarter miler.

05:18.517 --> 05:29.929
And so to weigh 200 pounds and run a quarter mile was considered fair at that time.

05:33.873 --> 05:43.423
Had it been this, in this generation, I would probably have

05:43.589 --> 05:47.655
played quarterback or not a lineman.

05:47.695 --> 05:51.881
A lineman now weighs 300 pounds, so I would have been small.

05:51.921 --> 06:01.935
But I came and there was really not much recruiting to the system.

06:02.928 --> 06:07.833
because we had athletes leave the first month we were here.

06:07.933 --> 06:10.716
They just disappeared and went to other schools.

06:11.016 --> 06:19.585
And I remember Gil Bartosz who went to TCU, he wished he'd never played against A&M.

06:19.606 --> 06:28.195
But we had Ralph, we had several players that just overnight disappeared and ended up at other schools.

06:29.035 --> 06:32.479
Describe your coming up here

06:33.235 --> 06:39.027
to stay, who brought you, what did you bring, how did you get here?

06:39.209 --> 06:43.916
Well, everybody came under the same guise then.

06:43.956 --> 06:49.063
You got a letter that says all you can bring with you is one footlocker.

06:49.304 --> 06:54.752
And so you scrambled around at the Army Surplus and found a footlocker.

06:56.154 --> 07:00.199
I didn't need that big of a, to bring my belongings.

07:00.219 --> 07:01.581
I didn't need a footlocker.

07:01.621 --> 07:08.912
But my mother and dad drove me to College Station for, I guess, maybe the first time.

07:08.892 --> 07:17.725
They put me out over at... Freshmen came in early, so they put me out over by Hart Hall.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.647
That's where athletes live.

07:20.989 --> 07:38.494
And I took my footlocker out of the trunk, set it on the ground, and my mother and daddy left, and my dad said, if you don't like it, well, just come on home.

07:38.474 --> 07:40.056
That's the way we operate.

07:40.116 --> 07:46.085
Nobody in my family has ever been to college in their life and didn't know why you went to college.

07:46.606 --> 07:48.229
And that was about what time of year?

07:49.110 --> 07:55.059
That would have probably been in August of 48, I guess.

07:55.079 --> 07:59.706
And describe, what did you have in that footlocker?

08:00.715 --> 08:05.280
I have, cannot remember anything because... Did you have a suit?

08:05.841 --> 08:06.181
Oh, no.

08:06.682 --> 08:08.044
I didn't even own a suit, no.

08:08.624 --> 08:14.672
No, because we, of course, were furnished our clothes at that time.

08:14.852 --> 08:20.138
Everybody's in court, cadets, and so it's kind of interesting.

08:20.198 --> 08:28.528
We lined up in front of Hart Hall for the first time in uniform, and

08:29.318 --> 08:38.539
But before we did that, we had my roommate and I, he was Denny Hudson from Port Arthur, Texas.

08:38.599 --> 08:45.775
We knew we had to have brass over our uniform to differentiate what outfit we were in.

08:46.312 --> 08:53.900
The person that overlooked all the athletes at that time was Mr. Lupo.

08:54.761 --> 09:00.988
He had the bookstore, and so we went down to Mr. Lupo.

09:01.068 --> 09:09.297
They gave us our books, of course, and so forth, and told him we thought we'd better get some brass for our uniforms.

09:09.457 --> 09:14.462
And so we looked through the assortment of brass,

09:14.442 --> 09:36.113
and we liked the one with the cross sabers best of all and so we bought a Calvary brass and came back and wore it to the first time we had a drill and we were

09:36.093 --> 09:47.204
The athletics at that time was infantry, so we were a little bit out of uniform, but it never did bother us a great deal in the athletic dorm.

09:47.665 --> 09:50.473
Now you said Lupo gave you the books.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.041
Literally, was it a gift?

09:53.061 --> 10:15.297
Well, yeah, I guess it's kind of a gift, but Mr. Lupo, any athlete and perhaps other students that had any difficulties at that time, he was able to help them out financially, I guess.

10:15.277 --> 10:23.761
Describe your introduction to the chow hall, the routine, and the dining hall, and so forth.

10:24.724 --> 10:30.079
Well, we, Hart Hall was on military walks.

10:30.768 --> 10:39.162
We marched into Cebiza Hall, which is at the end of Military Wall, the north end of it.

10:40.605 --> 10:51.443
And during football season, A-Athletics didn't have to do that much drill, but we did always

10:51.862 --> 11:05.722
We ate all of our meals at Hart Hall and we were served, lots of us, by fellow athletes because in those days you didn't, not many people had full scholarships.

11:05.842 --> 11:16.317
They were given a half or a quarter scholarship and then worked their way through in the mess hall.

11:16.297 --> 11:20.789
tuition at that time I remember was $25.

11:22.013 --> 11:24.680
Did you have a full scholarship?

11:24.700 --> 11:26.124
No, partial.

11:26.405 --> 11:31.318
And so when I came, when I came

11:31.298 --> 11:41.994
We had to have $25, which I hated, but, you know, all that came back in a way.

11:42.075 --> 11:53.492
But I just remember it was $25, and then you had your uniforms furnished, and you had your meals furnished, and books furnished.

11:53.472 --> 12:03.368
But I even don't know that we could afford, at that time, that my family could afford the $25.

12:03.708 --> 12:09.017
Do you remember how much spending money you brought with you other than that?

12:09.233 --> 12:11.376
Oh, I doubt if any.

12:15.462 --> 12:20.109
It was a strange transition, to say the least.

12:20.610 --> 12:35.933
And then the academics were quite different from high school, yet must have had a better high school education than I thought.

12:36.503 --> 12:49.751
In fact, the gentleman that taught me literature in high school was, I saw him at my 50th high school reunion.

12:50.532 --> 12:51.775
He's still alive.

12:52.136 --> 12:56.605
And I recited Chaucer to him.

12:57.260 --> 12:59.946
And it just tickled him to death.

13:00.327 --> 13:05.738
And that football player especially would have remembered that.

13:05.798 --> 13:09.526
And I thought it was kind of foolish when I was memorizing those things.

13:10.187 --> 13:13.294
But he taught us to write essays.

13:13.949 --> 13:21.322
about literature and poetry, and then my English teacher was my wife's mother all the way through high school.

13:22.304 --> 13:33.443
So evidently we came out with the ability to speak and write, which if you're going to colleges,

13:33.423 --> 13:34.224
important.

13:34.846 --> 13:38.953
Now you got here before classes started though for fall football.

13:38.973 --> 13:39.334
Yes.

13:43.141 --> 13:48.711
Describe football practice during those first days before the rest of the students got here.

13:49.352 --> 13:51.195
Well football practice

13:51.766 --> 13:56.210
was to me not very much unlike high school.

13:56.630 --> 14:03.617
I mean except we had a, our coach was unusual.

14:04.617 --> 14:20.912
Bones Irving was our coach and freshman coach and so Bones never could remember anybody's name and so you were kind of a number I guess for a long time and then

14:20.892 --> 14:25.921
Now, Harry Statler, the head coach, was entirely different.

14:26.823 --> 14:30.850
Harry remembered everybody's name and knew us until he died.

14:31.972 --> 14:39.626
But we had, at that time you had to play freshman football and so on.

14:39.646 --> 14:43.052
About how many freshmen were there on the team?

14:43.690 --> 14:45.994
Oh, we've got a picture somewhere.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.822
I'm guessing probably 60, 70.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.146
I just don't remember.

14:52.186 --> 14:56.755
I still, we're still very close, all of us.

14:57.376 --> 15:05.714
back in those days what we had to be because as freshmen, we were the only freshmen on campus athletes.

15:06.095 --> 15:09.943
Everybody else lived out at the Bryan Air Force Base.

15:11.046 --> 15:15.756
And so A&M had

15:17.221 --> 15:27.315
probably had an enrollment of about 10,000 at that time, and most of the people on campus were veterans.

15:27.335 --> 15:41.975
And so here we were, 17, 16, 17-year-old kids, competing academically in all our classes with veterans, and it made it rather difficult academically.

15:42.837 --> 15:46.722
But football practice, we just

15:47.107 --> 15:52.212
went down as soon as we got out of class every day.

15:53.113 --> 16:00.540
They tried to arrange our schedule the best they could where we'd be off by two or three o'clock in the afternoon.

16:01.501 --> 16:07.848
We worked out until there was a train, Sunset Limited came through here to Dallas.

16:08.909 --> 16:15.375
So we worked out every day until Sunset Limited came by, which was usually six o'clock.

16:15.355 --> 16:21.461
Then we showered and cleaned up and walked from Kyle Field to Cebisa and ate.

16:22.822 --> 16:27.867
Usually got back in the dorm at eight, nine o'clock at night, probably ate.

16:30.670 --> 16:34.894
Studied if you weren't too tired or too beat up.

16:35.294 --> 16:42.201
And this all started over again about six o'clock in the morning.

16:42.281 --> 16:44.383
Describe how you registered.

16:45.106 --> 16:46.288
for your classes?

16:46.428 --> 16:47.650
Did y'all stand in line?

16:48.552 --> 16:53.981
Seemed like when we were athletes, we were kind of pre-registered.

16:55.464 --> 17:04.279
What I think they, in order for us to get the schedule that we needed to work out, seemed like we were pre-registered, but we didn't have

17:05.795 --> 17:11.662
Didn't have really, wasn't ever much said about majors.

17:11.682 --> 17:27.080
You just, everybody took English and history and the biology and everybody seemed to take about the same thing.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.785
Did you, had you begun to think about what your major would be?

17:32.677 --> 17:38.524
Oh yes, in a way my coach again influenced me.

17:38.584 --> 17:54.882
I thought I wanted to be a coach and he said coaching is very difficult, it's very political, requires long hours and he and I hunted together all the time.

17:54.942 --> 17:55.984
Was this Coach Vithian?

17:56.104 --> 18:01.570
Yes, I had bird dogs and we hunted and my closest friend, Jordan Runnels,

18:02.326 --> 18:07.972
inseparable for all our high school days.

18:07.992 --> 18:14.259
And he said, if you like the outdoors that much, and he said, you ought to be an ag teacher.

18:15.099 --> 18:18.803
But we didn't have ag teachers in our high school.

18:19.524 --> 18:24.109
I don't guess many did back in the, or not the, not the cities.

18:24.189 --> 18:28.013
So I guess I tended to go

18:28.499 --> 18:36.349
He said, if you want to work with kids and all that, so I finally ended up in agricultural education.

18:37.170 --> 18:42.356
Who were some of those, in those first classes, who were some of the teachers that you recall here?

18:42.376 --> 18:42.436
Oh.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.221
Were there some?

18:46.301 --> 18:48.343
Cotton Joe Mockford.

18:48.764 --> 18:49.385
What did he teach?

18:50.066 --> 18:53.730
He taught agronomy.

18:54.959 --> 19:13.658
I had several English teachers, Mr. Eckfeldt, and what you remember about him is he came to class one time and he knew everybody in the class the next time.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.144
I can't...

19:19.124 --> 19:24.049
I can't recall whom I had for math.

19:25.211 --> 19:32.178
Oh, I had Mr. Martin for entomology.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.204
I just, it's very difficult to.

19:38.045 --> 19:40.187
History, biology.

19:40.227 --> 19:42.229
English.

19:44.311 --> 19:48.456
Of course, eventually we had to all take chemistry and physics.

19:49.010 --> 19:50.954
Do you remember who you had there?

19:53.719 --> 19:59.089
Well, I had organic chemistry.

19:59.109 --> 20:00.913
I had step and a half hedges.

20:02.496 --> 20:04.740
For undergraduate chemistry,

20:06.644 --> 20:09.288
The head of the department taught it.

20:10.189 --> 20:17.100
He thought that he ought to teach and teach freshmen, but I can't remember his name for the life of me.

20:17.140 --> 20:18.482
I just can't.

20:18.502 --> 20:19.744
It's too far back.

20:19.764 --> 20:24.872
I can remember all my veterinary professors, but I can't remember my undergraduates.

20:24.852 --> 20:32.511
That first fall, how did you find the academic rigor for you?

20:32.551 --> 20:36.581
You said that your high school had prepared you well.

20:36.721 --> 20:39.368
How did that hold up?

20:41.086 --> 20:46.894
It was, to me, it wasn't that difficult.

20:46.914 --> 21:08.342
Of course, you have to realize that we were all freshmen together, athletes together, and we didn't really have two dogs, but we had people that we were in, kind of helped one another, and I just didn't find it that difficult.

21:08.322 --> 21:19.398
Our football team had a B average, which was, you know, everybody thought that was pretty good.

21:19.578 --> 21:22.883
It would stand up pretty well today, wouldn't it?

21:22.903 --> 21:23.123
Yeah, yeah.

21:23.143 --> 21:27.029
Oh, gosh, we had, let's see, J. Rowe Notaris was valedictorian.

21:27.169 --> 21:27.750
Who?

21:27.770 --> 21:31.115
J. Rowe Notaris, he was valedictorian.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.777
T-A-R-R-U-S?

21:32.757 --> 21:40.539
From El Campo, we had J. Rowan Tardis, Elo Novich, and Glenn Lippman.

21:40.559 --> 21:48.100
And I don't know what they do in El Campo, but J. Rowan Tardis was valedictorian of Texas A&M.

21:48.738 --> 21:56.428
Glenn Lippman was the outstanding and highest grade point in engineering.

21:57.929 --> 22:06.840
And Elo Novitsa was the highest-ranking student in business administration.

22:08.262 --> 22:14.610
And Paul Lemming, well, we just had

22:14.962 --> 22:17.487
For some reason, we just had a bunch of good students.

22:17.527 --> 22:19.651
Now, we had some that pulled us down.

22:21.094 --> 22:24.380
I won't mention their names.

22:25.462 --> 22:30.672
Was there anyone that you and the other athletes would go to, particularly for academic advice?

22:31.173 --> 22:37.746
Yeah, we had an advisor called Dog Dawson.

22:38.333 --> 22:46.186
He and his brother had played football here, and he was about, oh, six, five, a big man.

22:46.246 --> 23:00.730
But he was, if we had any so-called problems, academic or otherwise, Mr. Dawson was our one to contact.

23:00.878 --> 23:05.568
Was he the one that you also would go to regarding what to take the next semester?

23:06.951 --> 23:18.516
We never got, never seemed to be very concerned what we were going to take the next semester because not until we got on into

23:19.643 --> 23:25.536
past our sophomore year, I guess, that we'd have to declare a major and those kind of things.

23:25.857 --> 23:28.242
Did you make some special friends that first year?

23:29.424 --> 23:34.716
Oh yes, many of them were still friends and we still

23:35.995 --> 23:40.343
still act like or think like we did when we were that age, I guess.

23:40.563 --> 23:47.415
We still, as athletes do, they always get better with age and we remember all the good things.

23:48.417 --> 23:53.025
We had a boy on our football team named Kenneth Shove.

23:53.005 --> 23:59.884
We beat the Shorthorns bad in 48.

24:04.297 --> 24:08.348
We beat Texas my senior year.

24:08.328 --> 24:19.021
And the varsity tied them my freshman year, 77, in Memorial Stadium, which was really upsetting to them.

24:19.601 --> 24:23.005
And Darrell Hooper kicked the field goal.

24:24.687 --> 24:33.998
And our senior year of 50, it would have been 51, I guess, to beat them here at Kyle Field.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.225
We had a good athletic program.

24:37.866 --> 24:51.092
We won one track conference championships seven years in a row, but we had Darrell Hooper and Buddy Davis, a good group of athletes.

24:51.072 --> 24:55.076
Buddy Davis set the world record in high jump.

24:55.136 --> 24:57.979
He jumped the first man to ever jump seven feet.

24:59.781 --> 25:06.748
And it was my privilege to know him real well.

25:06.868 --> 25:10.992
I had a letter from him when he was at the Olympics in Helsinki.

25:11.012 --> 25:13.114
And he's from your part of the state also.

25:13.134 --> 25:21.062
Yeah, he's from the Needland, Fort Natchez area.

25:21.042 --> 25:22.684
Hart Hall routine.

25:23.084 --> 25:26.047
Describe your room your freshman year.

25:26.128 --> 25:27.149
What was in that room?

25:28.951 --> 25:31.473
Well, Hart Hall was a different dormitory.

25:31.513 --> 25:35.218
The only one like it on campus, I guess, nearly.

25:36.719 --> 25:44.788
It was built in what they called ramps, and I was in D-8 or D-ramp.

25:44.768 --> 25:51.275
You had, I think Hart was two-story.

25:52.036 --> 25:58.424
If you were in a ramp, you had two adjoining rooms on the first floor and two adjoining rooms on the second floor.

26:00.346 --> 26:03.830
There would be four rooms in the quad.

26:04.811 --> 26:08.295
But anyhow, you had my

26:11.515 --> 26:16.708
Well, you shared a common bathroom between the two rooms in the heart.

26:16.728 --> 26:23.044
So you always call them your crapper buddies or whatever.

26:23.311 --> 26:30.599
Mine happened to turn out to be Mike Griner and Jimmy Flowers.

26:33.703 --> 26:35.525
They were upperclassmen, of course.

26:35.545 --> 26:36.426
Who was your roommate?

26:37.367 --> 26:39.749
Denny Hudson from Port Arthur.

26:40.050 --> 26:41.471
H-U-T or H-U-D?

26:42.452 --> 26:43.233
H-U-D.

26:43.714 --> 26:44.234
Hudson.

26:45.315 --> 26:45.876
Okay.

26:45.856 --> 26:53.006
Anyhow, we were Fish and Max Greiner and Jimmy Flowers were juniors.

26:55.409 --> 27:02.138
The board was still very much a part of A&M culture then.

27:03.920 --> 27:10.429
If Jimmy or Max weren't feeling too well, Max was first sergeant, as a matter of fact, in our outfit.

27:10.966 --> 27:24.665
If we lost a game or they just wasn't feeling well and they had some time on their hands, they'd call the freshman, Dean and I, over and wake us up with the board a little bit.

27:25.226 --> 27:32.236
But they turned out to be some of my closest friends as time went by.

27:32.276 --> 27:38.965
Max died here about six months ago, I guess.

27:38.945 --> 27:42.810
Did you and your roommate have to run errands for those two upperclassmen?

27:43.571 --> 27:44.272
Oh, yeah.

27:44.452 --> 27:46.455
That was just part of it.

27:48.317 --> 27:50.480
They were good guys.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.762
That was just the system.

27:53.704 --> 28:04.378
In the chow hall, did you all have the same kinds of games being played that were played by the other corps outfits?

28:05.050 --> 28:09.234
Not so much to start with.

28:09.254 --> 28:12.277
Of course, there was a difference between fall and spring.

28:13.078 --> 28:32.796
We became more military in the spring after the fall football season was over, but we had the same nomenclature, and we had to sit in the same places as freshmen always did, and we had to serve the upperclassmen first and

28:32.776 --> 28:41.574
and the usual and ask for permission to leave the table or to have our kush or the general routine.

28:41.694 --> 28:43.097
Did y'all have kush questions?

28:43.979 --> 28:51.173
Well, that was, we did have campusology, which

28:52.503 --> 29:05.459
to me was a real bore because there was so much to learn about every building and every object and when it was built and just everything about it.

29:06.080 --> 29:12.908
To me, it took a lot away from my study time for my curriculum.

29:13.870 --> 29:17.775
During the fall semester, describe a typical weekday.

29:17.815 --> 29:19.997
What time did it start?

29:20.077 --> 29:21.379
What did you do when?

29:22.743 --> 29:42.220
Well, there's a difference as to what year you're in, but as freshmen, we normally fell out at, it seemed like we fell out about

29:42.200 --> 30:05.929
We probably had to get up about 6 and you always had to have your bed made up and room cleaned up and you went to chow hall and you ate and you didn't have to come back in formation and you made your classes as your schedule dictated.

30:05.909 --> 30:14.038
And you didn't usually have any, and then you had your practice sessions in the afternoon, and you didn't.

30:14.459 --> 30:16.000
Football practice began about when?

30:16.961 --> 30:23.749
Oh, it seemed like, best I remember, was around 3 o'clock, something like that.

30:23.769 --> 30:32.018
But they, I suppose we were a little bit...

30:32.690 --> 30:41.083
handled a little bit more lenient being in the athletic dorm than the other core dorms.

30:41.103 --> 30:55.466
But I finally, after I was injured in the spring, had to move out of the athletic dorm the next year into a core dorm.

30:55.506 --> 31:00.334
So I got a good example of both, I suppose.

31:01.968 --> 31:03.309
Let's discuss that.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.051
You injured how, when?

31:05.772 --> 31:20.406
Well, I had, in the spring of that year, I had dislocated shoulder and rotator cuff.

31:22.127 --> 31:28.093
And at that time, Blaine and...
