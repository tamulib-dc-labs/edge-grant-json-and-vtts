WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:07.918
Certainly in that particular situation, it was a 
gross misrepresentation of the facts. That was

00:07.978 --> 00:11.728
simply not the case.

00:12.856 --> 00:14.618
a non-issue, if you will. There was not that much 
involved.

00:20.466 --> 00:41.412
I can't help but, in retrospect, or looking at it 
from the current perspective, wonder just

00:20.466 --> 00:41.412
exactly what the situation is in other 
demonstrations, if you will.

00:41.628 --> 00:50.059
I'm untrusting of what I see presented in the media 
as a major situation. I think that, well, I fear

00:51.060 --> 01:07.281
that in many situations what looks like a major 
demonstration may be just a very small group

00:51.060 --> 01:07.281
making a very large amount of noise. Actually, the 
only personal confrontation I had with Savio and

01:09.860 --> 01:25.264
his followers was, I guess in retrospect, a 
somewhat humorous situation that came up. When I

01:26.466 --> 01:35.260
was at Berkeley working on my doctorate, I did my 
research work at the Lawrence Radiation

01:26.466 --> 01:35.260
Laboratory up on the hill. And it was literally up 
on a hill. It was a long, steep road going up to the

01:37.450 --> 01:41.355
laboratories. At that time, I managed to get back 
and forth between home and the laboratories on a

01:42.075 --> 01:58.294
Vespa motor scooter, which was not the most 
powerful device I've ever had the privilege to

01:42.075 --> 01:58.294
drive around. In order to get to the laboratory on 
the Vespa, I would have to wind it up like a top at the

01:58.814 --> 02:17.039
bottom of the hill and roar with all my heart right 
up to the back door, because if I didn't, if I slowed

01:58.814 --> 02:17.039
down on the way up the hill, I simply couldn't make 
it. I would literally have to get off and push that

02:17.239 --> 02:21.165
brute all the way to the top of the hill. There 
was... One situation when Savio, trying to make

02:24.616 --> 02:44.008
some point, I have not the foggiest notion as to 
what it was at that time, but they decided that they

02:24.616 --> 02:44.008
were going to boycott the Rad Lab, and various 
members of Savio's following most of which,

02:44.309 --> 02:55.941
incidentally, I don't think had any idea as to what 
they were trying to say or what their

02:44.309 --> 02:55.941
demonstration was about. But they blockaded or 
tried to blockade the laboratory, and they did it

02:56.521 --> 03:06.591
by means of setting up effectively human 
barricades on the road. Well, I didn't know what

03:07.372 --> 03:14.299
they were doing, but I came to work one morning, and 
with my usual technique, I wound the Vespa up at the

03:14.633 --> 03:19.801
bottom of the hill, and I was going hell-bent for 
thunder for the top. And here they were, standing

03:20.262 --> 03:23.407
in front of me, waving placards at me. And there was 
no way I was going to push that Vespa all the way to

03:24.168 --> 03:29.256
the top of that hill, so I just kept on going. And I'm 
afraid that Savio's followers ended up thrashing

03:30.078 --> 03:37.590
rather vigorously in the bushes by the time I got 
by. But it's... I didn't really feel like I was

03:40.216 --> 03:50.768
doing the system any real justice. I simply was 
going to work.

03:56.695 --> 04:07.708
Very recently there's been a good deal of 
publicity given to a group called the Union of

03:56.695 --> 04:07.708
Concerned Scientists and their claims of the 
danger of of the nuclear industry and nuclear

04:07.942 --> 04:37.392
energy as a as a source has been fairly widespread 
what are your perceptions of their claims or or of

04:07.942 --> 04:37.392
their group and have you had any personal dealing 
with them i've certainly had no personal dealings

04:07.942 --> 04:37.392
with them i got a number of flyers from them through 
the mail and i get a lot of that kind of information

04:07.942 --> 04:37.392
and after i'd glanced at the first couple of them I 
decided that I would probably have to deal with it

04:37.793 --> 04:58.620
as just more junk mail and I very frankly haven't 
followed them that closely it's my understanding

04:37.793 --> 04:58.620
that this is a group of

05:02.161 --> 05:13.852
of well-educated personnel that are very 
concerned about the use of nuclear reactors or

05:02.161 --> 05:13.852
nuclear power in this country. I guess I, to a 
certain extent, have to regard that type of

05:14.873 --> 05:31.729
movement as principally being, well, as I say, 
well-educated but uninformed non-experts. They

05:36.149 --> 05:59.573
don't really know the technical details of the 
nuclear industry, and I frankly feel, and this is a

05:36.149 --> 05:59.573
personal opinion, I frankly feel that most of 
their concerns are completely unfounded, and I

06:00.413 --> 06:25.172
Although they certainly have the right to espouse 
whatever opinions they choose to hold, I am

06:00.413 --> 06:25.172
concerned, again from a personal perspective, 
that they are in fact doing the country and modern

06:00.413 --> 06:25.172
society something of a disservice dealing with it 
in the way that they do. and not being specific with

06:26.148 --> 06:52.054
regards to the Union of Concerned Scientists, but 
I think other anti-nuclear movements or groups in

06:26.148 --> 06:52.054
general, generally deal with the nuclear 
question in terms of scare tactics.

06:52.456 --> 07:01.827
And many of them understand more than they would 
generally, one might generally suppose that they

06:52.456 --> 07:01.827
do. But as far as I'm concerned, they deal with 
things from the point of view of fear. They try to

07:14.302 --> 07:18.447
frighten people rather than inform them. Many of 
the claims that they make are totally specious and

07:18.933 --> 07:34.515
are technically, I think, verging on the absurd. I

07:36.017 --> 07:44.248
think that it's certainly true that the the use of 
nuclear reactors nuclear power is not to be

07:44.954 --> 08:06.405
regarded as a trivial risk there is risk 
associated with with the devices i think there is

07:44.954 --> 08:06.405
no question about it there are situations albeit 
situations that are very, very improbable in my

08:06.605 --> 08:13.840
estimation that can be dangerous. And the fact 
that people are concerned about them is not at all

08:15.985 --> 08:26.487
surprising or inappropriate. think that when 
you're dealing with the hazardous situation or a

08:26.467 --> 08:51.782
hazardous device it is only it only makes sense for 
people to try to inform themselves as best they can

08:26.467 --> 08:51.782
with regards to the real hazard and what the basis 
for real concern is and if one on the basis of the

08:51.982 --> 09:15.627
facts, comes to the conclusion that the hazard is 
higher than is appropriate or than can be, well, in

08:51.982 --> 09:15.627
this particular case, from a societal point of 
view, can be tolerated, then that particular line

08:51.982 --> 09:15.627
should not be pursued. I think, however, that is 
not the way that the nuclear issue is being

09:16.028 --> 09:22.915
handled. I frankly feel that

09:22.935 --> 09:43.875
much of the

09:22.935 --> 09:43.875
way that people are handling it almost comes under 
the category of intentional obfuscation, the

09:22.935 --> 09:43.875
confuse,

09:46.218 --> 09:56.979
provide misinformation rather than trying to 
clarify the situation, they make it as murky as

09:46.218 --> 09:56.979
possible and make it as confused as possible. And 
that is an approach that I frankly simply have no

09:57.540 --> 10:05.155
tolerance for. Recent presidential 
administrations have taken fairly strong stands

10:07.784 --> 10:15.875
either for or against nuclear energy as a national 
resource. Can you detail some of your

10:16.876 --> 10:25.948
perspectives of President Carter and then 
President Reagan's policy concerning nuclear

10:16.876 --> 10:25.948
power? SECRETARY KERRY, Let me begin with 
President Carter's administration. From the

10:35.375 --> 10:42.449
perspective of the nuclear industry, President 
Carter's administration was essentially a

10:35.375 --> 10:42.449
disaster.

10:45.334 --> 10:57.197
And let me hasten to note that what I'm going to say 
now is strictly a personal opinion, but in my

10:45.334 --> 10:57.197
estimation,

10:57.970 --> 11:26.745
the stands, if you will, that the Carter 
administration took with regards to nuclear

10:57.970 --> 11:26.745
power were effectively based on what

10:57.970 --> 11:26.745
is almost a total lack of understanding, in my 
estimation, with regards to the purpose and

10:57.970 --> 11:26.745
function hazards or lacks of hazards with regards 
to nuclear power. President Carter, I think,

11:27.282 --> 11:37.320
started out his administration on the wrong foot 
with regards to the nuclear industry. I think his,

11:39.644 --> 11:46.756
where he really shot himself in the foot was when he 
contended that he was a nuclear engineer. He was

11:47.838 --> 11:50.723
taken to task on that point very rapidly. I think 
his closest association with things nuclear was

11:52.190 --> 12:11.964
the fact that he had spent some few weeks or a month 
or whatever on a nuclear submarine and in his

11:52.190 --> 12:11.964
estimation that was sufficient to allow him to 
contend that he was in fact a nuclear engineer. He

12:12.986 --> 12:16.071
was very quickly called on that point and Once it 
came to issue, it became a very quiet issue as far as

12:16.557 --> 12:22.972
the administration was concerned. He was not, he 
doesn't understand or didn't understand the

12:23.494 --> 12:34.600
potential values of nuclear power. And I think 
that he did the industry as a whole a severe

12:35.187 --> 12:45.106
disservice, principally out of ignorance. And 
that bothers me, that that kind of situation could

12:45.346 --> 12:54.343
cause the damage that it did.

13:01.428 --> 13:10.235
Do you believe that the current administration 
has taken any steps to correct the attitude that

13:01.428 --> 13:10.235
was held by President Carter's administration? 
Okay, the Reagan administration. I think that the

13:14.259 --> 13:22.586
Reagan administration is much more realistic in 
their approach to nuclear power. They have one,

13:23.527 --> 13:31.013
certainly one major item that they are pushing. 
and possibly not at all inappropriate, but

13:31.448 --> 13:47.272
President Reagan would like to turn the function 
of nuclear power development over to the private

13:31.448 --> 13:47.272
sector. That, I think, has some virtue. However, 
from a pragmatic point of view, I'm not sure that

13:51.619 --> 13:56.005
it's that realistic. The reason I say that is that 
in general most of the the nuclear power systems

13:59.444 --> 14:29.299
that are potentially available for development 
involve times amounts of money and risk that is

13:59.444 --> 14:29.299
financial risk that is still inappropriate for 
the private sector i think that to a very major

13:59.444 --> 14:29.299
extent it's going to be very difficult to talk the 
private sector into getting involved in a very

14:29.819 --> 14:42.377
major way in the development of major nuclear 
power systems. I think one of the reasons is that

14:42.397 --> 14:54.915
the private sector simply is not very trusting of 
the national system, if you will, they were very

14:55.402 --> 15:06.315
badly mistreated during the Carter 
administration in the sense that they were

14:55.402 --> 15:06.315
regulated almost out of existence. Governmental 
regulations were conceived of and put into effect

15:07.316 --> 15:23.215
that almost

15:07.316 --> 15:23.215
destroyed the nuclear power development that was 
going on the private sector had a great deal of

15:24.038 --> 15:51.430
money and still has a great deal of money involved 
or committed to development of nuclear power and

15:24.038 --> 15:51.430
because of of

15:24.038 --> 15:51.430
regulate regulatory

15:24.038 --> 15:51.430
stands that the government took they were 
effectively hamstrung and it cost an absolutely

15:51.832 --> 15:55.196
ferocious amount of money. And I think that in 
general the private sector is going to be very

15:55.757 --> 16:18.784
reluctant to get back into that situation where 
they have effectively put their own money at risk,

15:55.757 --> 16:18.784
realizing that the government could effectively 
hamstring them at any minute. think that they're

16:19.034 --> 16:28.767
going to be very reluctant in the future to move 
with any kind of vigor into that kind of a situation

16:19.034 --> 16:28.767
again. During the last few years, one of the 
strongest and most vocal proponents of the

16:30.369 --> 16:40.182
nuclear programs in Washington and within the 
administrations was Admiral Hyman Rickover in

16:40.651 --> 16:48.181
his various capacities as nuclear advisor to the 
president or to Congress. When he was retired,

16:49.102 --> 16:52.807
that was quite a commotion. Do you see his 
retirement as a positive influence on the

16:52.868 --> 16:59.036
national programs? And what are your 
perspectives of Admiral Rickover's recent work?

17:03.922 --> 17:09.510
I certainly have never had any direct involvement 
with Admiral Rickover. Just as a personal

17:09.980 --> 17:29.230
opinion, I think that over the years his influence 
has been a very positive one, not only from the

17:09.980 --> 17:29.230
perspective of the nuclear industry, but

17:09.980 --> 17:29.230
just generally from a social point of view. I think 
he's been a very positive influence. I think that

17:34.634 --> 17:52.430
he obviously did a very fine job in getting the 
nuclear navy in place, the nuclear subs in

17:34.634 --> 17:52.430
particular, I think can be given to Admiral 
Rickover as a very positive accomplishment. He, I

17:53.992 --> 18:04.101
think in some situations, went a little further 
than

17:53.992 --> 18:04.101
was practically advisable. that is trying to 
develop a surface Navy that was atomic powered was

18:04.469 --> 18:19.553
something that was really before its time, if its 
time ever does come. But I think with regards to the

18:20.395 --> 18:28.688
nuclear sub fleet that we have now, that is 
essentially a

18:31.132 --> 18:38.382
something that Admiral Rickover was essentially 
responsible for in a fairly personal way. I think

18:39.383 --> 18:53.342
that currently, well, that is the commotion that 
you referred to with regards to his retirement, I

18:39.383 --> 18:53.342
think Admiral Rickover did a fine job, and I think 
that during the time that he was working

18:54.014 --> 19:23.312
effectively, he was a very positive influence, 
that everybody comes to the end of their rope, and I

18:54.014 --> 19:23.312
think that the Admiral had just about outlived his 
technological usefulness, and so I think that the

18:54.014 --> 19:23.312
fact that he was retired when he was was 
essentially appropriate.

19:29.536 --> 19:41.183
In light of the current research and the current 
information available, what do you see as the

19:29.536 --> 19:41.183
state of the art in technology in specific regard 
to plutonium technology?

19:44.335 --> 19:50.945
That question covers a very, very wide range of 
activities.

19:52.427 --> 20:04.004
I think that, well, let me say that plutonium is a 
material that is, from a scientific point of view,

19:52.427 --> 20:04.004
is very fascinating to work with. It has a very 
complex chemistry. It has an extremely complex

20:06.828 --> 20:09.111
metallurgy. I think there is obviously a great 
deal of work that is being done and needs to be done

20:09.631 --> 20:23.876
in the future from a purely scientific point of 
view. I think that there are a number of

20:24.737 --> 20:33.613
developments that are in the offing. for 
instance, with regards to the metallurgy of

20:34.488 --> 20:47.384
plutonium that are of potential great value to the 
weapons programs in the country. I think there's a

20:48.085 --> 20:54.413
great deal of very interesting work that is being 
done. And I think that certainly significant

20:54.453 --> 21:04.005
developments relative to the manufacture of 
plutonium and the processing of plutonium in one

21:04.255 --> 21:18.856
light or another that will be a substantial 
advantage with regards to the weapons industry.

21:20.759 --> 21:33.317
In other areas, for instance, reactor fuels, 
there's a great deal of work to be done there.

21:33.736 --> 21:49.620
The principal place where plutonium is used in the 
reactor industry is with regards to the

21:33.736 --> 21:49.620
development and operation of, at the present 
time, liquid metal fast breeder reactors. That is

21:49.720 --> 21:56.710
the primary place where plutonium would be used in 
the reactor industry. There's a great deal to be

21:59.094 --> 22:02.038
done there. Frankly, I think that the LMFBR

22:02.525 --> 22:17.359
industry in the United States is operating at a 
severe disadvantage. Well, and by disadvantage I

22:18.840 --> 22:31.452
mean that the LMFBR development in this country 
has been very heavily well,

22:31.837 --> 22:44.774
has been held back to a very major extent because of 
the regulatory problems that I mentioned a moment

22:31.837 --> 22:44.774
ago.

22:49.661 --> 23:00.696
Well, the development of LMFBRs in this country is 
very substantially behind that in many of the

22:49.661 --> 23:00.696
other major countries around the world. The 
French, for instance, are really at the forefront

23:01.283 --> 23:08.452
of development. The Germans are working. The 
British have a substantial amount going that is

23:11.475 --> 23:21.247
significantly in advance of what we're doing now. 
Unfortunately, it's really kind of interesting

23:22.349 --> 23:30.919
with the fact that because of the anti-nuclear 
movements, and the various regulatory problems

23:31.152 --> 23:59.404
that the LMFBR people have run into in this country 
that led to the LMFBR being effectively

23:31.152 --> 23:59.404
downplayed or downgraded has had an interesting 
reflection in some of the European countries that

23:31.152 --> 23:59.404
were vigorously moving toward the development of 
an LMFBR. we began to back up and for some reason

23:59.941 --> 24:29.475
they started backing up too and it's almost as 
though it was a the system became unstable to a

23:59.941 --> 24:29.475
certain extent and much of the the pressure or 
impetus if you will to the development of LMFBRs

23:59.941 --> 24:29.475
has begun to to lose its momentum And that I 
personally feel

24:30.147 --> 24:40.740
is going to be a very major problem not very many 
years into the future. I can see very major

24:41.541 --> 24:52.575
difficulties on the horizon with regards to the 
availability of power. And the LMFBR was

24:52.595 --> 24:57.741
originally intended to help close that gap. But 
it's beginning to appear to me that that gap is not

25:02.725 --> 25:11.613
only not being closed, we're losing ground on it. 
And there may be, there may come a time when the

25:12.014 --> 25:26.428
power situation in the world will make us all rue 
the day that the LNFBR was What are the problems

25:27.488 --> 25:38.619
with the LMFBR that inspire the over-regulation 
or the dissent against that program? I think the

25:39.580 --> 25:45.525
dissent is primarily based on concerns with 
safety. There are several scenarios, many of

25:46.927 --> 25:56.736
which in my estimation are simply not credible. 
that lead some to feel that the LMFBR is simply not

25:57.155 --> 26:11.719
safe to have

25:57.155 --> 26:11.719
in the country. They envision LMFBRs, or reactors 
in general, as effectively being a a bomb sitting

26:21.725 --> 26:26.770
there waiting to explode, and that simply is not 
the case. They cannot explode in that way. I must

26:32.096 --> 26:41.245
hasten to add that reactors are not without risk. 
There are things that can happen that can cause

26:41.325 --> 26:44.969
problems. However, I think many of the problems 
that are effectively suggested as being probable

26:49.636 --> 27:10.958
are really extremely unlikely situations and I 
think they're just not at all, they're so unlikely

26:49.636 --> 27:10.958
that they really in my estimation should be of no 
major concern. One of the other things that is

27:12.400 --> 27:19.187
leading to concern about the LMFBR is the fact that 
many people, and I'm sure they are expert in their

27:19.758 --> 27:33.418
area, are suggesting that uranium reserves in 
this country are such that the LMFBR truly is not

27:19.758 --> 27:33.418
needed. And by that I mean that you can operate 
power reactors as

27:46.960 --> 27:50.304
as the light water reactors are operated now. You 
simply burn the uranium and throw away the fission

27:50.384 --> 27:55.630
products and that's that. And you don't have any 
mechanism for continuing to grow new fissile

27:56.370 --> 28:04.940
material. That is the virtue of the breeder. It 
effectively manufactures more fuel than it

28:07.863 --> 28:10.946
burns. That is fine as long as you have of 
sufficient uranium to keep the system operating

28:15.665 --> 28:20.735
effectively ad infinitum. I, frankly, am not very 
comfortable with that new plan. I'm afraid we're

28:25.485 --> 28:34.483
going to need it over here, and it may be too late 
once it's really recognized as being needed.

28:37.535 --> 28:54.137
Dr. Green, in conclusion, do you feel that since 
its conception that the nuclear industry or the

28:37.535 --> 28:54.137
field of nuclear research has advanced, and if so, 
do you believe that it will continue to be a viable

28:37.535 --> 28:54.137
source or an energy program in the future? Well, I 
think from a technological point of view, over the

28:55.438 --> 29:05.331
few years that the industry has been in existence, 
technologically there have been tremendous

28:55.438 --> 29:05.331
advances. Unfortunately, it almost appears 
like, in a political sense, the industry has been

29:05.648 --> 29:16.058
marching backwards. That is to say that its 
acceptance by the man on the street has degraded

29:16.639 --> 29:35.217
very dramatically and in a very discouraging way, 
as far as I'm concerned. It's really too bad, I

29:35.922 --> 29:43.852
think, that people have developed such a 
mistrust. And I think that, as I said earlier, I

29:44.814 --> 29:56.309
think a great deal of that mistrust is born of fear, 
and most of the fear is born in ignorance. And I wish

29:56.870 --> 29:59.533
we could turn that around.
