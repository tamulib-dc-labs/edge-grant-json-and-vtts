WEBVTT

00:03.743 --> 00:06.467
Let's turn to your retirement then. I was 
wondering, you retired from the military because

00:06.647 --> 00:14.177
of your thirty years. Thirty years service, 
that's right. And so there was no chance of staying

00:17.481 --> 00:19.684
on then? The only chance of staying on was getting 
in a promotion spot, being the division

00:20.485 --> 00:32.822
commander, and General Rutter and I are the same 
age and he was in it. had no reason to retire. And the

00:35.219 --> 00:39.104
only way he had to get another star, then. He had a 
second star. Yeah, but I mean, for you. And the only

00:41.728 --> 00:48.036
way for me to get a second star would be get into his 
job, or similar jobs somewhere in the United

00:41.728 --> 00:48.036
States. And of course, they keep that within an 
Army area. Yeah. So there was no place for me. And I

00:56.307 --> 00:59.311
got what they call a statutory requirement. It's 
30 years, period. Yeah. I was BG for seven years,

01:04.055 --> 01:10.462
permanent rank, and it was pretty good. Now, how 
did you feel on the day you retired? Well, I felt

01:14.387 --> 01:18.372
with mixed emotions. I had to have mixed emotions.

01:22.616 --> 01:30.906
I was leaving something that I had nurtured from 
something that was mediocre to something that was

01:22.616 --> 01:30.906
superior. And I built it up. I could see myself 
accomplishing something. And I had that

01:35.179 --> 01:40.084
tremendous satisfaction in knowing that I had 
accomplished something. On the other hand, I've

01:42.146 --> 01:48.854
known the regulations for 30 years or more. And 
you're facing it. Yeah. Nothing you can do about

01:54.480 --> 01:55.081
it. Nothing you can do about it except conform. 
It's the law of the land. It's the Army

01:59.025 --> 02:01.888
regulations, so to speak, ARs. And the only way I 
could have stayed on was by being promoted. And

02:06.885 --> 02:12.213
there was no spot for it. Of course, you had a lot to 
look forward to in the civilian world, too. You

02:14.776 --> 02:15.237
bet. I had a going business that I carried forward. 
I was deeply engrossed with it, very active. A lot

02:22.547 --> 02:29.597
of people said Brunt Company was a one-man show, so 
to speak.

02:32.142 --> 02:35.445
It wasn't a one-man show, but it was one-man 
direction.

02:38.328 --> 02:40.150
It was my money, and I was looking after it. That's 
another way of putting it. I was making it

02:42.912 --> 02:50.880
appreciated by virtue of working and making it 
earn me money.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.985
If you have to, well, let's do this. When we take a 
look at your, over your 30 years now, I'd like to

03:02.551 --> 03:27.782
know what things in the military over those three 
decades stand out as what you'd call your

03:02.551 --> 03:27.782
achievements and what things stand out as oh maybe 
shortcomings you just couldn't finish something

03:02.551 --> 03:27.782
or get something obviously a general doesn't have 
very many failures but I mean just something that

03:02.551 --> 03:27.782
you couldn't accomplish

03:30.867 --> 03:34.031
In the Army, I don't know of anything that I'd set 
out to do that I didn't accomplish.

03:44.585 --> 03:56.740
In combat and all my Army work, up until I got in the 
9th Divardy, I accomplished what I wanted. In the

03:56.956 --> 04:01.040
little picture, meaning I did a superior job and I 
traded for it and that's that. In the 90th Divardy,

04:02.982 --> 04:11.850
I set my goals of being combat proficient for the 
Divardy, meaning all of its parts. And like I say,

04:13.632 --> 04:22.761
it was a five-year program. I didn't start on it. 
and set my sights and my direction until the second

04:24.125 --> 04:28.371
year, in the second year. So it was a five-year 
program, and I accomplished it on the fifth year.

04:34.520 --> 04:40.889
In total, I accomplished it with two battalions 
first, and then the three battalions, and then the

04:34.520 --> 04:40.889
fourth battalion. So you'd probably consider 
that your finest achievement? I consider that I

04:45.175 --> 04:52.866
left out division artillery, combat proficient, 
period. And that's all any commander can ask for.

04:55.652 --> 04:55.892
Sure.

05:00.557 --> 05:02.199
I turn it over to my successor. I turn it over back to 
General Rutter. General, your division

05:05.242 --> 05:10.949
artillery is combat proficient. It's passed its 
test on the critical army eyes, and there's

05:10.969 --> 05:16.415
nothing more I can say about it. That's all I had to 
say. That's right. That's all I had to say. I

05:21.922 --> 05:26.088
enjoyed working for you, and I'll see you next 
football game maybe. Something like that. He and I

05:28.392 --> 05:30.375
used to go to a lot of football games together. 
Let's talk about General Rutter because it was

05:31.036 --> 05:41.371
during his years that there were so many changes at 
A&M that I want to get your opinion on, but first

05:31.036 --> 05:41.371
let's talk about Earl Rutter.

05:44.316 --> 05:48.723
Earl Rutter was a salt of the earth. No question 
about it. He came from, I don't know whether you

05:50.677 --> 05:54.182
know where Eden is or not. No, I don't. He was born 
out in Eden, out in Concho County, which you know

05:55.623 --> 06:00.490
where San Angelo is. Well, San Angelo is up in that 
part of the county and Eden is down in this part of

06:00.510 --> 06:05.777
the county. And it's ranching country, goat 
ranches, sheep ranches, some cattle. But he went

06:14.148 --> 06:20.616
to school there, grammar school and high school, 
probably a one-room school, if you knew the truth

06:14.148 --> 06:20.616
of it. It's a very small town. It's just a big 
crossroads with a couple of truck stops and a

06:23.309 --> 06:34.180
general mercantile store and a drug store and a 
couple of cafes. One nice cafe and one coffee shop.

06:39.866 --> 06:40.786
It's terrible. I built three jobs in that county. 
So I've been to all the truck stops there.

06:52.726 --> 06:58.193
I guess there's maybe 300-400 people living, 
eating proper, and of course the ranchers and all

06:52.726 --> 06:58.193
that. What kind of man was Rudder? They said he's 
the salt of the earth. He's the salt of the earth,

07:03.600 --> 07:05.203
that's right. He's, well, to start with, he's a 
rancher boy. And all he knows is hard work and

07:11.851 --> 07:17.599
honesty and being a good fellow. He went up to John 
Tarleton, from high school. And one of the

07:24.444 --> 07:29.652
ranchers gave him a milk cow when he went up there. 
And he took this damn cow up there and sold milk to

07:29.672 --> 07:36.863
get through college. And of course, John Tarleton 
then was a junior college. and he played football

07:46.625 --> 07:56.615
up there and got a football scholarship to go to A&M 
and so he went down there and finished his Union

07:46.625 --> 07:56.615
senior year at A&M. That happened in 1932. He was 
down in the infantry and I was in the artillery so I

08:00.779 --> 08:13.611
would pass one another, knew one another, but not 
eminently.

08:16.426 --> 08:21.052
He was a very capable person, business-wise.

08:24.636 --> 08:41.117
After he got out of the Army in 1945 or 6, whenever he 
got out, I don't know, he went back to Brady, which

08:24.636 --> 08:41.117
is a county seat just below Eden in McCulloch 
County.

08:45.653 --> 09:09.711
bought into or bought a

08:45.653 --> 09:09.711
royal tire store, combination appliance store 
and filling station and you know, sold all kinds of

08:45.653 --> 09:09.711
refrigerators and tires and stoves and that type 
of store and had a couple gasoline pumps out front.

09:10.492 --> 09:13.737
Basically a tire and appliance store.

09:18.239 --> 09:19.862
on his U.S. Royal. And he participated in civic 
enterprises and elected mayor over there.

09:32.586 --> 09:41.462
And

09:32.586 --> 09:41.462
did a good job as mayor of Brady and was very civic 
minded and

09:48.766 --> 10:13.442
They had a scandal down in the Texas Land Board, 
Land Commissioner had this program of

09:48.766 --> 10:13.442
veteran benefits and that they would help you buy a 
farm or a ranch up to 10 acres or $7,500 I think was

09:48.766 --> 10:13.442
the maximum at that time anyway. And they caught 
one of the then I want to say Baskin-Giles. I don't

10:19.169 --> 10:21.672
know whether that was that fellow's name or not. 
Anyway, they caught him buying up property and

10:21.692 --> 10:28.380
then selling it to this program. And as soon as they 
did, why, they tried him and convicted him. And of

10:35.429 --> 10:40.014
course, that relieved him of his land 
commissioner's job. And the governor appointed

10:40.034 --> 10:46.262
the mayor of Brady, which is Earl Rudder, land 
commissioner. And Earl went down there and

10:47.997 --> 11:08.355
straightened it out and established certain

10:47.997 --> 11:08.355
protective

10:47.997 --> 11:08.355
steps to going through this process that 
eliminated that possibility anymore.

11:10.036 --> 11:17.683
He set it up at the county judge in your particular 
area, and maybe the county auditor and somebody

11:10.036 --> 11:17.683
else set it on a land board.

11:20.431 --> 11:29.845
to where they had to prove the value of the land 
before the veterans' loan people down there, the

11:20.431 --> 11:29.845
land commissioner, would even accept the 
application. Well, that put the monkey on the

11:31.587 --> 11:40.100
county judge's back and the county comptroller or 
the county treasurer, whatever they got. And one

11:41.041 --> 11:42.483
other person, I forget. Somebody that was 
supposed to be of integrity in the county. And I

11:48.412 --> 11:49.273
eliminated that. that possibility of fraud or

11:50.317 --> 12:03.350
conspiracy to defraud the government or the 
commission.

12:06.853 --> 12:16.903
And then the next thing you know, he realized that 
they were out of money and they only had made, let's

12:06.853 --> 12:16.903
say, 10,000 loans. And here's a million. 
ex-servicemen wanting them. So he sponsored a

12:23.421 --> 12:39.660
constitutional amendment of changing the law to 
where they would allocate or authorize another

12:23.421 --> 12:39.660
$200 million investment in it. I passed

12:41.102 --> 12:48.150
73.

12:49.413 --> 12:58.405
That rocked along and it was so successful they 
passed a second amendment, increasing it again to

12:49.413 --> 12:58.405
maybe another $200,000, $300,000. It was so 
successful of helping a man buy a piece of land. And

13:07.036 --> 13:16.669
that set him up to where he was heir apparent and 
theoretically set up to run for the governorship.

13:19.130 --> 13:24.056
And I used to visit with him. I was his devotee 
during those years. And I'd go down there, or we'd

13:26.799 --> 13:31.125
go to summer camp together. I'd be in Austin to the 
highway landings, and I'd go up and talk with him.

13:36.711 --> 13:38.694
He'd come to Dallas, and he'd come out the house. 
And we'd proper feet up on the cocktail table and

13:39.835 --> 13:47.905
have a drink and eat peanuts and talk about 
problems that he was having. He talked to me about

13:49.555 --> 14:09.567
running for governor, and about that time,

13:49.555 --> 14:09.567
the presidency of A&M became vacant. Did the 
general want to run for governor? Was he that

14:14.976 --> 14:16.558
inclined? Well, he was that inclined, yes. On the 
other hand, he said, Graber, where am I going to get

14:20.661 --> 14:23.344
a million dollars? And it cost a million dollars to 
run a statewide race. And I said, well, Earl, I

14:28.109 --> 14:29.591
don't know. But I'll give you more on my share. All 
he could do was thank me. But he says, I'm just

14:36.558 --> 14:38.660
dumbfounded. I don't know where to start raising 
that kind of money without incurring some

14:38.700 --> 14:43.285
obligation. And I'm not going to be obligated to 
anybody if I run for governor. Anyway, about that

14:48.533 --> 14:59.966
time, the presidency for A&M opened up, and I 
forget why it opened up,

14:48.533 --> 14:59.966
but it did. And he talked to me about that. What did 
he say about that? He asked me what I thought about

15:04.831 --> 15:07.034
it. I remember these words, and he reminded me of 
this, probably the next to last time I ever saw him.

15:19.752 --> 15:31.483
My words were that, Earl, you can do more good for 
the state of Texas as president of Texas A&M than

15:19.752 --> 15:31.483
you ever could as governor. Because a governor has 
certain political obligations, and you are

15:33.245 --> 15:43.535
building men over at A&M to run our state. And your 
impact on the student body over there will turn out

15:50.144 --> 16:06.806
such high caliber men that go to every crossroad in 
this damn state where your efforts as governor

15:50.144 --> 16:06.806
down there, you jockeying political patronage 
and deals with the legislature and you know those

15:50.144 --> 16:06.806
sorry bastards. You're dealing with the 
lobbyists here and you're dealing with everybody

16:06.846 --> 16:12.533
and you're in the middle all the time. How do you 
respond? Well, he took the job as president of A&M.

16:17.814 --> 16:19.736
Well, what did he think as far as your advice? Of 
course, he said, I didn't know about that when I

16:20.297 --> 16:34.676
told him that he could make more impact on the state 
of Texas as president of A&M than he ever could

16:20.297 --> 16:34.676
think about as governor. I don't know. You didn't 
know him, but he kind of snickered and said, I don't

16:35.157 --> 16:38.161
know about that.

16:41.145 --> 16:43.388
But he reminded me that I told him that. Oh, the last 
two or three times I saw him, one of those two, the

16:44.043 --> 16:57.160
last two or three, he died very suddenly, and

16:44.043 --> 16:57.160
that was that. But he was the salt of the earth. 
There was no bad, and it was all good in him. Because

17:05.631 --> 17:07.473
I knew him, and I knew him as a soldier. I knew him in 
combat in Europe. Did you know him in combat? Oh,

17:11.638 --> 17:13.020
gosh, yeah. What rank was he when after the war? I 
mean as soon as the war was over? Well he was

17:16.494 --> 17:19.278
lieutenant colonel and then he made colonel. 
About the same time you did? Yeah about the same

17:23.725 --> 17:25.648
time I did. He was he was lieutenant colonel 
commanding his second range of battalion in

17:26.429 --> 17:35.402
Europe which is fighting a bunch of fighting SOBs. 
They had that reputation and I'll show you his

17:36.223 --> 17:42.332
reputation. They were, he personally was the 
first man up the cliffs in Omaha Beach. And General

17:51.427 --> 18:02.484
Bradley wrote him up in his book, I don't know 
whether you've read it or not, of where he

17:51.427 --> 18:02.484
chastised Earl for going up there. He was a 
commander. He was supposed to see if the job was

18:03.445 --> 18:06.389
done, not go up there and do it himself. And Earl 
told him that the only way he knew that the job was

18:07.211 --> 18:12.859
going to be done was to be up there and see if it was 
done. And they went in and neutralized these shore

18:13.531 --> 18:16.675
defenses. Some particular cannons they had up 
there, they had to neutralize to keep them firing

18:17.516 --> 18:30.231
on our people coming in, all that kind of thing.

18:30.251 --> 18:38.661
I went to see him one time in Europe, and I was

18:30.251 --> 18:38.661
so mad at him I won't kill him. He

18:39.586 --> 18:50.884
came in to the, we were in the Roar Valley, waiting 
for the American troops to capture the Roar Dam.

18:52.186 --> 18:55.290
Otherwise, if we'd have started across there, 
they could open the dam up and wash us out. Sure. And

18:56.532 --> 19:03.383
we were up there for a week or more and

19:05.388 --> 19:14.959
I forget the number of the division, but they gave 
some division this responsibility, and they

19:05.388 --> 19:14.959
tried at night, and they tried at daytime. They 
couldn't do it. The Germans just beat them back.

19:17.683 --> 19:18.323
That's all they stood. And somebody suggested 
about the Rangers. Turned over to the Rangers, let

19:24.030 --> 19:26.934
them go do it. And Earl was, his battalion was 
nominated to do it. by the command of the Ranger

19:31.072 --> 19:32.815
Force. And I don't know who that was. I don't know 
who they were responsible to. There was a special

19:36.720 --> 19:46.936
task force that was set up for specialized jobs, 
and I guess all the way back in the War Department in

19:36.720 --> 19:46.936
Washington. But anyway, they gave that mission to 
the 2nd Ranger Battalion.

19:59.658 --> 20:05.984
beefed him up, gave him a bunch of help, and he went 
in there and did it in one night, captured and

19:59.658 --> 20:05.984
intact. And that left a bunch of the, our Corps, we 
were in the 19th Corps of the 9th Army, and that let

20:07.386 --> 20:19.198
our Corps go on across the valley, because they, 
with the Americans in control of the gates and all,

20:07.386 --> 20:19.198
they couldn't wash us out. Well anyway, word 
circulated around through all our soldiers, I had

20:25.713 --> 20:27.315
a fighting son of a bitch. There was a fighting 
outfit. And one of my six strippers, my operations

20:30.460 --> 20:37.270
sergeant, who was a hell of a fine man, came in to me 
three or four days later. He says, Colonel, I want a

20:37.291 --> 20:42.819
bus, and I want to leave the outfit. Of course, that 
floored me, because he was my right-hand

20:42.839 --> 20:45.763
operations sergeant. What the hell are you 
talking about, sergeant? You been drinking or

20:48.167 --> 20:49.489
something? No, sir. I want to join the 2nd Ranger 
Battalion. Why do you want to do that? Because

20:54.876 --> 21:02.046
they're fighting some bitches, and they got a 
colonel down there that's out in front of them. And

21:02.066 --> 21:04.650
I want to go down there and fight with them. Well, a 
man tell you that, you can't say, no, I won't

21:05.911 --> 21:09.116
approve your transfer. And Earl wouldn't take him 
as anything but a private, because he didn't want

21:11.018 --> 21:18.308
to upset his esprit among his own people. So this 
boy took a bus from Sixth Stryper to one striper to

21:22.261 --> 21:26.105
join the 2nd Ranger Battalion. Because of his 
admiration for Colonel Rutter. And of course, I

21:31.050 --> 21:33.032
was only looking for Earl Rutter. I'd known him in 
school and I'd known him since then. What the hell

21:38.558 --> 21:40.921
is he doing proselyting my people like that? But, 
uh... What did he say? Oh, he just laughed at me and

21:44.485 --> 21:47.408
said, oh, get off my back. Come on, let's have a cup 
of coffee and a donut. I got some hot donuts down

21:49.950 --> 21:51.492
here. And he said, that man came to me, and I guess 
it's true, that man came to me and wanted to join my

21:51.809 --> 22:00.498
battalion. And I told him, hell, I couldn't take 
6th Striper. He said, well, I'll take the bus if

22:02.660 --> 22:04.422
you'll take me. And when my operations sergeant 
told him that, he said, well, you go get

22:05.643 --> 22:10.488
transferred then. I'll prove it when you come over 
here. And I mean, what can you do with a man that you

22:14.252 --> 22:21.259
depend on and has that capabilities to the Army? 
And he thought so well of Colonel Rutter that he

22:22.724 --> 22:31.678
would take a bus from Six Stripe to One Stripe to get 
to serve under you. That's incredible. That's

22:33.001 --> 22:36.526
right. But that's Earl Rutter. Let's talk about 
the changes. That, to me, is the salt of the earth.

22:44.118 --> 22:46.382
Yeah. I never had anybody come and tell me they'd 
take a bus to come in my outfit. But that old boy did.

22:58.131 --> 23:07.445
Let's talk about the changes during the Rudder 
presidency, because they were fundamental

22:58.131 --> 23:07.445
changes, revolutionary changes to Texas A&M. 
First, we allowed women, and then we allowed

23:07.465 --> 23:10.450
blacks, and then all at the same time pretty much, 
then the end of the Mandatory Corps, and

23:10.801 --> 23:22.473
eventually this institution grows from 6,000 in 
1960 to 34,000 today in 1981. I mean, these are

23:22.533 --> 23:25.656
incredible changes. That's right. I like your 
opinion of these. Well, all for the better.

23:31.382 --> 23:33.063
Everything was for the better. Now, let me tell you 
my story about Earl Rudder again as president of

23:33.083 --> 23:37.568
A&M. He went down there. Tom Harrington was still 
president,

23:39.675 --> 23:47.049
and he had the dual jobs.

23:49.674 --> 23:57.729
And academically, Tom was probably qualified, 
but administrative-wise, he was not. He taught me

23:59.612 --> 24:01.075
fish chemistry. And so he was probably two, three 
years older than I am. He was working on a doctor's

24:05.609 --> 24:09.553
degree or something and teaching, you know. And he 
stayed with them and made them a good hand. And he

24:14.518 --> 24:22.086
got up to be eventually president and then 
chancellor of the university, or his university

24:14.518 --> 24:22.086
by then. No, it wasn't either. It was still 
college. Because Earl supervised that change in

24:26.010 --> 24:30.775
the name University, or college? College 
University. He and I, in our living room over where

24:34.219 --> 24:43.450
you were last night, talked about that very thing 
before it ever, when he was proposing it, in his own

24:34.219 --> 24:43.450
mind, building this direction. And what 
motivated him to thinking in those terms, he told

24:45.473 --> 24:57.707
me that when he went down there, A&M was getting 
about $500,000 worth of national grants a year.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.253
from big corporations, you know. It set up teacher

25:00.373 --> 25:11.471
chairs and research chairs, research 
laboratories and all this kind of thing. And

25:12.472 --> 25:23.990
United Fruit Company was getting ready to set up a 
tropical fruit disease laboratory in Nevada

25:12.472 --> 25:23.990
School. Yeah.

25:28.315 --> 25:31.439
He said, Grandma, I've been up there three times 
now, and they won't even talk to me. They just tell

25:31.519 --> 25:34.082
me they're not going to give any money to that 
college. They give their money to universities.

25:39.309 --> 25:41.972
And he said, I'll try to get in the back door. I'll 
try to get in both side doors, and they won't even

25:41.992 --> 25:45.156
open the front door for me. Talk to them. And I said, 
well, hell, just change your name from college to

25:47.739 --> 25:50.242
university. That's easy. All you got to do is write 
an order. And he said, oh, that's not that simple.

25:55.128 --> 25:56.770
And then we talked about this thing. He may have 
thought about it, but I ventured the approach to

25:57.340 --> 26:01.566
it. And, well, what's going to happen? I think it 
took a legislature move. I said, well, I don't know

26:10.799 --> 26:12.342
about the legislature. The first people you've 
got to sell are the damn ex-students, because

26:12.362 --> 26:19.933
there's no more vociferous crowd in the world than 
A&M ex-students. And if you sell them on the

26:19.953 --> 26:22.556
program, why, it'll be easy. If you don't sell them 
on the program, they'll crucify you. And he said,

26:27.175 --> 26:30.419
well, that's the damn sure truth. And so he set 
about a sales campaign, if that's a good way to put

26:32.121 --> 26:40.772
it, to the ex-students. And pointing out the fact 
that he can't get an increase in the national

26:40.793 --> 26:55.191
corporation grants

26:40.793 --> 26:55.191
under the name of a college. And he needs that 
money. The college needs that money.

27:03.515 --> 27:09.304
And the students received it affirmatively. Then 
he went about it down to the legislature. He still

27:13.169 --> 27:15.392
had to sell the board of directors on it. Then the 
legislature got the thing changed. And that to me

27:19.578 --> 27:26.308
was a turning point of his direction of making, 
turning A&M from a country college to a great

27:27.217 --> 27:31.644
university. That was the first step.

27:36.331 --> 27:42.701
Sometime in the latter years of his life, he told 
me, you know how much grant we got last year?

27:42.741 --> 27:47.748
Something over $15 million from $500,000. 
Nothing in the world but changing the name from

27:47.929 --> 27:51.334
college to university. Pretty new station here.

27:56.191 --> 28:03.201
So he had a very far-reaching vision of making that 
a great university. We talked about the

28:05.024 --> 28:08.368
enrollment. We got 6,000 students down there when 
he went over there, and now they got 36,000 or

28:08.388 --> 28:15.939
something. And he said, you remember when you went 
down there? Yeah. There weren't any girls around.

28:19.564 --> 28:20.586
No, there sure weren't. The only girls I ever saw 
were those laundry queens down there on the track

28:20.606 --> 28:25.793
Saturday night. And he says, you know how many 
students the university's got? No. But he quoted

28:33.863 --> 28:37.909
it in the 15s of 20,000 or something like that. 
University of Texas. University of Texas. And he

28:42.234 --> 28:44.477
says, the only reason is because they've got girls 
over there. I said, well, hell, that's easy. Just

28:49.925 --> 28:50.886
accept girls. Well, we don't have the 
dormitories. All the dormitories got urinals in

28:53.540 --> 28:56.683
them instead of commodes. And just thinking loud 
of all the problems you've got to contend with. And

29:03.811 --> 29:06.014
ultimately, would it be worth it? And I assured him 
it would be worth every bit of it. I know some of my

29:12.702 --> 29:21.632
contemporaries have kids that went to university 
because their girlfriend was going down to

29:12.702 --> 29:21.632
university. Are their girlfriends going to SMU so 
they want to go to SMU? They hate SMU with the guts,

29:26.963 --> 29:31.550
but their girlfriend's going out there, so that's 
where they're going to college. And that's a

29:32.151 --> 29:49.597
change of philosophy among students today, that 
they want to be in a

29:32.151 --> 29:49.597
co-educational institution. And so he said about 
the getting the board of directors to accept

29:53.438 --> 29:57.603
girls. And when they did, their student body 
started increasing on their straight up path.

30:09.058 --> 30:16.128
Eight, 10,000 the second or third year to 12, 
15,000 dollars, I mean 15,000 people to 20,000,

30:09.058 --> 30:16.128
25,000 and so on. Nothing in the world has 
accomplished that but co-educational education

30:16.268 --> 30:23.277
down there. And Earl Rudder was the papa of that. I 
discussed it with him. Whether I planned to see it

30:30.116 --> 30:34.119
or whether he had it in his mind, I don't know and 
don't care. But I know I did have a lot of discussion

30:35.080 --> 30:41.146
with him on it before it ever happened. I said once 
in this interview, sometimes he used me as a trial

30:42.307 --> 30:48.613
balloon with ideas. And he knew that I would tell 
him I got that's right or hell no, Earl, I wouldn't

30:54.138 --> 30:58.183
touch you with a 10-foot pole. And a lot of times he 
took, or it panned out that what I told him worked

30:59.264 --> 31:09.055
out, and sometimes he didn't accept it. And that's 
certainly his privilege. But Earl Rudder turned

31:13.380 --> 31:22.390
that college around to being a great university, 
set the stride for it to continue to be a great

31:13.380 --> 31:22.390
university,

31:25.863 --> 31:33.290
His untimely death, I hope, didn't lose stride 
with it.

31:35.713 --> 31:48.065
I know Dean Hubert, and I think he's a great teacher 
and educator, but I don't know what his

31:35.713 --> 31:48.065
administrator at Earl was. I don't think he is. 
He's a great educator, but there again, Tom

31:53.757 --> 31:56.300
Herrington was a great educator, but he wasn't an 
administrator. He couldn't go down to the

31:56.941 --> 32:03.288
legislation panel on the table and say, I've got to 
have $10 million or $20 million, $100 million, and

31:56.941 --> 32:03.288
get it. And Earl did. Now, what about those two 
other very important changes, one allowing

32:05.872 --> 32:13.220
blacks at A&M and the other ending the mandatory 
Corps of Cadets? Would you address yourself to

32:13.240 --> 32:14.622
those? Well, having blacks there is just as 
inevitable

32:22.563 --> 32:24.605
getting up in the morning and washing your face and 
hands. So much of the funds come from federal

32:26.327 --> 32:29.750
government. I don't know how much. If one dime 
comes from federal government, they get to tell

32:31.551 --> 32:35.235
you how to operate. And that's by Supreme Court 
edict. That's the law of the land, and you've got to

32:42.722 --> 32:45.705
like it. I don't have any idea how many blacks have 
gotten down there,

32:53.950 --> 33:01.761
I know there's not near as many racial-wise whites 
at Prairie View as there are blacks at A&M. And I've

33:03.264 --> 33:07.790
been to Prairie View where they're taking reviews 
down there with him. I took their final review one

33:07.810 --> 33:09.733
time down there. It was a thrill of my life. They've 
got an outstanding Corps. And they're making lots

33:17.524 --> 33:19.367
of good army officers for the Army. But anybody 
that fights that battle is just completely off

33:21.625 --> 33:31.776
base and not even in the ballpark, as far as I'm 
concerned, because first, that's the law of the

33:21.625 --> 33:31.776
land. And second, it's morally right that you give 
those people the same advantage as I had. And what

33:39.364 --> 33:40.665
they do is their business. And 99% of them, I guess, 
frittered away. But that 1% will pay off someday. I

33:49.494 --> 33:49.995
know they will. Now what about ending the Corps? 
Well, I grew up in a different time. I think that

33:58.036 --> 34:06.250
gets back to my philosophy on mandatory service to 
our country. I think that everybody ought to be in

34:08.093 --> 34:11.458
the Corps. Now whether that has enhanced or 
increased the enrollment or not, Certainly they

34:16.047 --> 34:33.167
couldn't have a core down there, and I have no idea 
how many male or female students they have, but I

34:16.047 --> 34:33.167
guess 8,000 of that 30,000 are female, and that 
leaves 30,000 male, and you couldn't have a core of

34:16.047 --> 34:33.167
30,000 people.

34:34.328 --> 34:36.291
Financially and physically impossible. Have 
they completely eliminated the core? I thought

34:42.438 --> 34:43.499
they had the core. No. Volunteer, totally 
volunteer. Yeah, greatly reduced. Every year

34:49.794 --> 34:57.342
with the fish coming in, they ask people if they 
want to join the Corps or not. And some do, and most

34:57.362 --> 35:00.465
of them don't. They have about, I think it's 2,000 
in the Corps out of 34,000. Yeah. Well, of course, I

35:06.191 --> 35:09.715
went down there. Of course, they have female in the 
Corps. Yeah. I went down there, and there are

35:12.337 --> 35:13.999
different, age where I just couldn't wait to get 
down there and be in the Corps. That was in my goals

35:23.150 --> 35:33.502
of life from the time I was thinking about going to 
high school and all through my high school of

35:23.150 --> 35:33.502
junior ROTC. I

35:33.522 --> 35:39.548
could pretty much have written

35:44.793 --> 35:48.097
history of my life of getting into the Corps. And at 
that time you either, if you went to A&M, you got in

35:49.739 --> 35:55.988
the Corps.

35:56.869 --> 36:03.898
Physical rejects were, still wore the uniform, 
but they were, they were called something

36:08.553 --> 36:12.920
So are you positive toward that move, then, to end 
the mandatory core? How do you feel about it? I know

36:17.627 --> 36:19.750
this must have been tougher, General Rutter. This 
must have really been tougher, General Rutter.

36:22.534 --> 36:23.255
I'm sure it was. But he could see that what he was 
doing was right, but versus the fact that it built

36:24.056 --> 36:34.091
the student body from 6,000 to 36,000. And you 
can't argue with that success. So maybe the

36:38.978 --> 36:43.003
Mandatory Corps is not the answer. To me, every 
youngster, male or female, that comes of age of 18

36:44.685 --> 36:57.362
or 19 or something, bang, ought to go into service 
for two years or some adjustable time. I don't care

36:57.442 --> 36:58.403
what it is. But they ought to prepare themselves 
for the defense of our country. And we got to

37:02.849 --> 37:04.592
talking about that thing. Is someplace for women 
to serve their country just as well as the big place

37:08.324 --> 37:10.086
in combat for men. I

37:11.548 --> 37:38.179
think that every student, every youngster is 
obligated to pay their, if there's another way to

37:11.548 --> 37:38.179
put it, to pay their liability, their debt to our 
society of a year or two service to qualify them for

37:11.548 --> 37:38.179
that privilege of defending our country. I

37:42.974 --> 37:51.943
owed it to my country to serve. I have never asked 
for or received one dime of compensation for

37:51.964 --> 37:59.451
having served my country. And I don't ask it. I have 
never conceived of asking it. My country had been

38:06.323 --> 38:07.864
good to me. It gave me an opportunity of an 
education to serve it and now to make a good living

38:07.964 --> 38:14.370
out of it. And that's what life's all about. On the 
other hand,

38:17.313 --> 38:24.579
I think everybody has that obligation. And I 
strongly favor university military service at

38:26.621 --> 38:34.828
some age, whether it's 17 to 19 or 18 20 or what it is. 
Across the board, every man, if he can't do active

38:38.809 --> 38:51.722
combat work, he can do the KP work, or he can do the 
typewriter picking, or he can do the

38:38.809 --> 38:51.722
administrative work, or he can do something. But 
without exception, he should pay his,

38:51.742 --> 39:03.533
if it's a good way to put it, his interest. toward 
the indebtedness of protecting this country. But

39:09.790 --> 39:19.786
of course, he's born with a, by virtue of being an 
American citizen born here, he's got the finest

39:09.790 --> 39:19.786
place in the world to live. And I humorously said to 
two, three people, they asked me about what is the

39:22.250 --> 39:32.406
finest thing I saw on our trip around the world. The 
finest thing I saw was DFW when we hit there. Bar

39:41.006 --> 39:41.507
none. There's just no place like it. And I've seen a 
lot of the world now. So in other words, with every

39:51.901 --> 39:58.309
single one of these major changes toward Texas 
A&M, You agree with those changes, and you think

39:59.048 --> 40:05.035
that they've improved this college to be a great 
university? It's changed A&M from being a good

40:05.335 --> 40:10.441
college to a great university. No question about 
it. And it was the finest place to get an

40:12.223 --> 40:17.650
engineering degree or an agriculture degree when 
I went there. But it's a better place today because

40:17.670 --> 40:21.454
of Earl Rudder. No question about it. Now we've 
covered your early years, your education, what it

40:25.627 --> 40:36.100
was like going to Texas A&M during the Depression, 
and your military career and your reserve career.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.523
I think we've covered, I'm out of questions. Do you 
have anything else that you thought was

40:39.785 --> 40:47.214
fundamental in your life or your career which you 
think we should cover? Is there something I've

40:48.756 --> 40:50.438
missed? No. You're the expert here. I'm not the 
expert. I just thank God for my privilege of having

40:54.635 --> 40:58.942
been able to attend A&M. And I know it made a better 
man out of me. It equipped me to do the things I've

41:03.310 --> 41:08.779
done in the Army and in my civilian pursuits. No 
question about it. Had I not gone there, I'd never

41:12.245 --> 41:14.128
have accomplished it.

41:19.137 --> 41:22.942
I'm looking forward to our 50th reunion next year. 
Sometime in May of 1952.

41:30.853 --> 41:36.301
Good Lord

41:30.853 --> 41:36.301
willing, the creeks don't get too high.

41:39.545 --> 41:43.651
No, I have no inhibitions about singing. A&M made a 
band out of me. It equipped me to do the things I did.

41:49.276 --> 41:54.484
It gave me the confidence that I could do whatever I 
wanted to. Sometimes my sights haven't been at the

41:56.407 --> 42:03.116
tops, but I could have raised them. Maybe I was 
complacent in having them set so high.

42:15.435 --> 42:15.695
I don't know. But I'm a dedicated A&Mx student. 
Yeah, I can see that.

42:23.662 --> 42:25.526
It's a great university. It was a good school when I 
was there, but it's a great university. Thanks a

42:30.056 --> 42:31.619
lot for this interview, General. I really 
appreciate your time. Well, the pleasure's mine.
