WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:11.987
by others to ride along, and one fellow took 
quantitative bottom samples, so I became

00:02.191 --> 00:11.987
familiar with the, not only with the techniques, 
but also with the ideas behind it. That is all to say

00:13.509 --> 00:22.984
that I did not become a pure plantologist, but did 
have one foot on the ground, figuratively

00:13.509 --> 00:22.984
speaking.

00:27.976 --> 00:51.168
And finally, during these years, and also, and I 
really, during these years, I mean since 49, and

00:27.976 --> 00:51.168
also after 55, after the degree, during the 
postdoc time, I participated in Cry's

00:27.976 --> 00:51.168
expeditions, which were concerned with 
production biology of plankton, and in part

00:27.976 --> 00:51.168
conducted the work for him when he fell ill or 
whatever it was. Cry had been interested in in the

00:56.748 --> 01:02.116
rapid determination of plankton, particularly 
phytoplankton. And rapid means rapid in contrast

01:02.136 --> 01:06.642
to the microscopical work. What he wanted to 
achieve is to work with hydrographers who take

01:06.662 --> 01:21.683
salinity and temperature samples, which can be, 
of course, easily determined, and somehow assess

01:06.662 --> 01:21.683
the amount of plankton in effect in chemical ways. 
He was the first to develop a sea-going

01:22.244 --> 01:26.670
chlorophyll method in 1939. He then, which of 
course only goes for the plants, and he then tried

01:28.068 --> 01:51.747
to develop a method for the total plankton and 
thought of filtering of the total plankton out of

01:28.068 --> 01:51.747
the water sample of a liter or five liters out of a 
water bottle over filters and thought that would

01:28.068 --> 01:51.747
give him the total amount of plankton and the 
chlorophyll would allow him to subtract the

01:28.068 --> 01:51.747
phytoplankton We know now that he developed the 
Cestan method. What he essentially determined in

01:55.558 --> 02:07.892
coastal waters was, well, not in coastal waters, 
what he determined was the total particulate

01:55.558 --> 02:07.892
matter, which in coastal waters is 
phytoplanktonal aride, so planktonal aride, but

01:55.558 --> 02:07.892
also a lot of inorganic material. So his method we 
call now Cestan method, and it was really his first

02:08.372 --> 02:16.722
student, Gilbrich, who pointed that out to him. 
that, dear teacher, you are all wrong. But he took

02:20.412 --> 02:40.228
it gracefully, and in the 50s was the scientist in 
the marine domain who pointed out to the rest of the

02:20.412 --> 02:40.228
world that most of the particulate matter and 
seawater in many, many places is not living, isn't

02:20.412 --> 02:40.228
plankton, and you geologists better do this and do 
that if you want to study the particulate matter

02:20.412 --> 02:40.228
and seawater. Well, and later on, when realizing 
that he didn't get at the zooplankton by just

02:41.356 --> 03:09.996
weighing, he developed a method for 
determination of protein, or albumin, as he

02:41.356 --> 03:09.996
called it, again thinking, well, albumin or 
protein decays relatively soon after the death of

02:41.356 --> 03:09.996
the organism, so if I know the total protein 
content in a sample and know also the chlorophyll

02:41.356 --> 03:09.996
content, then I probably could figure out the 
zooplankton. And these methods could be run on

03:11.123 --> 03:13.190
board ships. So two or three days after taking the 
samples, I already have the result and can plan my

03:13.230 --> 03:24.947
further expedition accordingly, which was a very 
modern idea. couldn't quite execute it, but that

03:25.349 --> 03:28.194
is a different story. At any rate, by 
participating in these expeditions, I became

03:28.234 --> 03:52.993
familiar with the methods, but perhaps more 
importantly also with his way of looking at the

03:28.234 --> 03:52.993
world to take a hydrographic cast first, to 
determine salinity and temperature first, and

03:28.234 --> 03:52.993
then decide what biological samples to take, 
which most pathologists and sociologists didn't

03:28.234 --> 03:52.993
do. but that was the characteristic of his school 
to really tie in with the hydrography. And that is

04:00.016 --> 04:02.581
what I really learned from Krai. And the exposure 
to this kind of doing plankton research and

04:04.825 --> 04:16.348
I should really interject, his samples were taken 
again from water bottles, that means from point

04:16.919 --> 04:20.044
samples, and not from nets. Remember the argument 
about the plankton pump. So the way of sampling

04:23.229 --> 04:29.680
lent itself more easily to close cooperation with 
the physical types. But then Kai was not in

04:30.381 --> 04:36.911
chemistry, he wasn't a biologist, so he did not 
scoff at looking at the microscope. We were

04:37.332 --> 04:39.796
trained to know animals. And as I said earlier, I 
have counted 1,000 animal samples, too. but we

04:45.218 --> 05:12.407
were a little unusual by having this extra 
exposure, which was reinforced by Wüst, who was

04:45.218 --> 05:12.407
the director of the institute, who entirely was 
interested in working on the Atlantic, rather

04:45.218 --> 05:12.407
than the keel bay, because he felt he was the 
legitimate heir to the meteor expedition, and

05:13.298 --> 05:21.110
tried to publish all what was still to be published 
on the big German Atlantic expedition on

05:13.298 --> 05:21.110
meteoroid during the 20s. So that all the lectures 
in physical oceanography were about the

05:23.113 --> 05:35.512
Atlantic, the open ocean, rather than the local 
waters, which is a little unusual for a coastal

05:23.113 --> 05:35.512
station to be told always about the open ocean, 
never about the home water. They didn't know

05:35.532 --> 05:36.994
anything about keel waves. And on the expeditions 
in the North Sea with CHI and, well, North Sea, the

05:38.645 --> 06:01.577
physical oceanographers we met also all came out 
of the Meteor School, so that the CHI students got,

05:38.645 --> 06:01.577
I think, quite an unusual training for coming out 
of a small institution, a coastal institution. In

06:01.597 --> 06:06.103
Woods Hole and Scripps, it goes without saying, 
but in Chesapeake Bay, it wouldn't be this way. And

06:08.243 --> 06:16.134
this sort of slant is, I think, still reflected in 
my way of teaching on the upper-division level.

06:16.154 --> 06:27.170
And of course, my students, the graduates too, but 
on the undergraduate level, I think I teach

06:16.154 --> 06:27.170
differently from most other oceanography 
schools or marine biology schools. I will come

06:27.791 --> 06:29.613
back to this point later. So to sum it up, we were In 
regard to the research on the biology of marine

06:33.235 --> 06:56.391
organisms, we were trained, now let me back up, to 
sum this up once more, we were trained by Kryan, by

06:33.235 --> 06:56.391
Wüst, really as biological oceanographers, and 
in effect learned not to concern ourselves with

06:56.995 --> 07:05.704
the biology of marine organisms as a subject of its 
own, but only as a means to understand the ocean

06:56.995 --> 07:05.704
better.

07:09.288 --> 07:10.969
So that is then 55 now.

07:15.734 --> 07:23.222
Subsequently, I couldn't get a position because 
there were no permanent positions around in

07:15.734 --> 07:23.222
Germany. German equivalent of NSF began to see the 
light and set out postdoc positions. They wanted

07:29.920 --> 07:35.012
to begin to build up staff and they realized they 
had to do something for the young people. So I

07:35.052 --> 07:39.743
received a postdoc award for three years. took 
with tenure in Kiel to work along a proposal of my

07:39.723 --> 07:54.363
own to study the distribution, the vertical 
distribution of copepods, crustaceans, in the

07:39.723 --> 07:54.363
Kiel Bay, essentially. And the idea came from 
working on these dissertation samples where I had

07:55.304 --> 08:08.582
kept an eye on the other animals too, without 
really making notes, but sort of had acquired a

08:09.457 --> 08:16.905
feel that the notion that copy-puts migrate, what 
every textbook said, there's diurnal

08:09.457 --> 08:16.905
migrations, didn't really hold. They didn't 
apparently migrate. And I proposed to the science

08:18.547 --> 08:25.114
foundation, let's investigate that, using these 
same samples we had already. So it was, in a way, a

08:25.154 --> 08:29.659
relatively cheap investigation. And I could, in 
fact, show that there is no vertical migration to

08:31.121 --> 08:36.527
speak of in these waters. And I also could show by 
study of literature that this had to do with the

08:38.127 --> 08:42.672
salinity stratification. And the result then is 
that the vertical distribution of these

08:43.773 --> 08:58.630
organisms, where you find them, in which depths 
you find them, had not so much to do with what the

08:43.773 --> 08:58.630
elements liked, but where the currents brought 
them, the currents and the mixing. And this, of

08:59.651 --> 09:03.595
course, very contrary to what in those years, at 
least every textbook said, including marine,

09:03.963 --> 09:18.438
so-called oceanography textbooks, they all 
implied that the animals, of course, you find the

09:03.963 --> 09:18.438
animals at that depth which they like most, by just 
migrating up and downwards. And I could show this

09:18.458 --> 09:19.759
is not so. And because of the, it is not so in Kiel 
Bay, and I could advance reasons that because of

09:30.170 --> 09:42.965
because the salinity stratification exists in 
many marginal seas, on many shelves, that it was

09:30.170 --> 09:42.965
likely that at least the smaller copepodes would 
not migrate there either, even in the upper mixed

09:30.170 --> 09:42.965
layer. And I guess in hindsight that this was said 
at least 10 or 15, or maybe by now 20 years too early,

09:45.427 --> 09:52.475
because nobody has really picked that up yet. And I 
have not been shown to be wrong. So it is still

09:56.560 --> 09:58.422
hanging, so to speak. And most people can't find it 
because they still use nets, with a few

10:00.511 --> 10:05.925
exceptions. And the net is towed through the mixed 
layer, and well, it's all the planters mixed up in

10:06.085 --> 10:13.063
one bucket. And so you can't say what they do.

10:23.647 --> 10:38.307
I will come back to this a little later because at 
the end, really, of that period in 1958, I begin to

10:23.647 --> 10:38.307
think about the problems of the mixed layer and the 
plankton distribution in the mixed layer. And as I

10:38.327 --> 10:40.350
said, I will come back to this later. But during 
these three years, which I consider to be really

10:42.873 --> 10:50.143
the most pleasant period of my professional life, 
I was already something. I had a Ph.D. degree, had

10:51.068 --> 10:55.816
also a reasonable income, but I had practically no 
obligations. So I had the best of both worlds, in a

10:56.397 --> 10:58.460
way. During these years, I did a few other things, 
too. As I had said earlier, I had participated in

11:01.565 --> 11:11.541
CRI's expeditions and in part conducted some of 
these, and so wrote my own papers on production

11:01.565 --> 11:11.541
biology, a la CRI. which was strictly concerned 
with concentrations. Rate measurements were not

11:13.905 --> 11:16.369
discovered by us, so to speak. And I also began to 
work on polycate taxonomy. I wrote a few papers on,

11:20.696 --> 11:31.633
really made revisions of some genera of benthic 
polycates, sabellites, which are still in

11:20.696 --> 11:31.633
interest, which I still have. And again, I will 
come back to that later.

11:39.449 --> 11:45.512
Yeah, and that is really the end of the training 
period, because in a way then post-doc is still in

11:39.449 --> 11:45.512
training period. By that time I had already 
crossed the bridge in the sense of that I did not

11:49.642 --> 12:17.387
pursue the teacher career and began to gamble now 
on that there would be a university career, much to

11:49.642 --> 12:17.387
the dismay of my father, who had paid through 1955 
and who had said, well, had you chosen economics,

11:49.642 --> 12:17.387
the bet would have been made, more or less, and you 
would be something now, meaning something

11:49.642 --> 12:17.387
already a university professor, possibly, or 
something in the free enterprise system.

12:20.995 --> 12:29.108
But before I go on, let me explain the ordinary way 
one entered into a university career. One took the

12:29.428 --> 12:40.506
PhD degree and then had to wait for what we would 
call an instructor position to become available.

12:41.144 --> 13:05.160
then became an instructor with some teaching 
duties but not much but the main idea being now to

12:41.144 --> 13:05.160
show to prove oneself by doing independent 
independent scientific work for five or up to ten

12:41.144 --> 13:05.160
years and then write a second second thesis which 
is still the way it's being done in sweden in italy

12:41.144 --> 13:05.160
and russia too so the really the second phd degree 
allowing you to enter the university career.

13:10.622 --> 13:11.703
That's quite different from here. So I had to come 
up now with a very thick other tone entirely of my

13:12.605 --> 13:18.413
own. And if you want to switch that off now, that 
would be the timing.

13:24.502 --> 13:29.950
So the question then was now what subject to 
tackle? And in oceanography, of course, that

13:30.824 --> 13:35.559
means not only having the idea, but also having the 
logistics behind you. Would somebody take you

13:36.060 --> 13:40.494
along on a ship, or would you get on a ship, and what 
have you. And Krai said, well, What is coming up now

13:42.940 --> 13:48.027
on the international scene is the IGY, the 
International Geophysical Year. We, Germany,

13:48.427 --> 13:53.574
that is, will invest into it, and this is your 
chance. Participate in a large expedition,

13:54.315 --> 14:02.345
gather very comprehensive material, and be sort 
of assured of funds for working it up. And never

14:02.385 --> 14:04.829
mind that you don't have an instructor position. 
You will have money to work that up. And I suggest

14:07.412 --> 14:10.416
that you work on the total phosphorus. And I 
thought it was just absolutely against my

14:11.476 --> 14:17.162
interest. First of all, there came up this chemist 
issue again. I would be again labeled a chemist.

14:21.506 --> 14:29.453
But also, I thought there was no issue to be solved, 
no major question to be solved by this total

14:21.506 --> 14:29.453
post-war business. And therefore, decided to 
pursue, to take up again in plan I had had earlier.

14:39.691 --> 14:42.135
to work on the plankton of the tropical ocean. And 
to make that a little more clear, I would have to

14:43.016 --> 14:59.961
back up for a moment and say that

14:43.016 --> 14:59.961
in my mind the most comprehensive plankton study 
ever made is that by Lohmann, who published in

14:43.016 --> 14:59.961
1908. And that, in a way, is still the best 
Planckman study ever, except now that he

15:01.055 --> 15:08.008
couldn't, in those years, measure the rate. He 
only measured concentrations. But it was the most

15:09.792 --> 15:15.503
comprehensive study up until now, 1977, three 
quarters of a century later. One of the

15:16.647 --> 15:32.833
contributions by Lohmann being showing how 
important it is to look at the small plankton,

15:16.647 --> 15:32.833
phytoplankton and zooplankton, that nets are 
inappropriate tools for collecting even

15:16.647 --> 15:32.833
zooplankton, if you wanted to know the total 
metabolism of the water column. That study of

15:34.977 --> 15:41.187
Lohmann's had been done in Kiel, and my idea was to 
repeat that study in the tropical ocean. And I had

15:42.652 --> 16:01.386
begun to look for an appropriate site a few years 
earlier when Nod, whom I had mentioned as somebody

15:42.652 --> 16:01.386
sharing my room, had gone to El Salvador in, I don't 
know, 54 or 55. But at that time, there was an

16:01.940 --> 16:09.991
exchange program between El Salvador and 
Germany, but their condition was you have to have

16:01.940 --> 16:09.991
the PhD, which I didn't. So El Salvador fell 
through, and in hindsight, it is good because I

16:10.051 --> 16:17.100
would have had to work in estuaries, and I wouldn't 
have managed to. I was not equipped to work. My

16:19.523 --> 16:26.192
training was too weak to face the plankton 
estuaries, really, to make some good story out of

16:19.523 --> 16:26.192
it. The next attempt was to go to Brazil, and again, 
there was an exchange program where Gerlach, whom

16:27.725 --> 16:49.632
I had mentioned before, had gone and had studied 
nematodes on Brazilian beaches, but that fell

16:27.725 --> 16:49.632
through because I had written to the Brazilians 
that I would need such and such instruments and I

16:27.725 --> 16:49.632
would hope that they would provide it, and I would 
bring this and this and that. And could they please

16:54.061 --> 16:57.966
write whether they have 110 voltage or 220? And 
when they were unable to answer that simple

16:58.887 --> 17:05.055
question, 110 or 220, I thought, well, better not. 
I knew of Hawaii, but that was out of reach because

17:06.997 --> 17:14.607
of cost, because of the very unfavorable 
conversion rate from Deutsche Mark to Hawaii. the

17:15.076 --> 17:15.817
dollar. I didn't know of Bermuda, where there was a 
very good current, very good program going on

17:16.317 --> 17:24.246
under Reith and Menzel. So I settled on India, 
where, again, exchange program, that is always a

17:25.728 --> 17:42.687
problem, or was a problem, how to finance such a 
stay on my own, because I sort of had told Kai, I

17:25.728 --> 17:42.687
don't want to go with you, and so Kai sort of was not 
angry, but somehow didn't feel obliged to now go

17:44.135 --> 17:51.765
out on a limb and ask for extra money in addition to 
financing his own expeditions. So I had to find my

17:52.387 --> 18:05.782
own money, in effect, and so India was the next 
place which seemed quite all right because India

17:52.387 --> 18:05.782
was moderately advanced as compared with Africa, 
say. Remember, I wanted to go to the tropics rather

18:05.802 --> 18:12.109
than to the temperate Africa, warm, temperate 
Africa, South Africa. There was nothing in the

18:12.750 --> 18:19.137
tropical Africa, and in America there was nothing 
either after Brazil

18:20.551 --> 18:22.453
didn't come to pass. I'd never thought of the 
Caribbean, I don't know why. At any rate, so that

18:25.115 --> 18:50.558
was then India, and they offered a two-year 
exchange, which anyway seemed very good because I

18:25.115 --> 18:50.558
thought of a seasonal study and figured that the 
first half year would be wasted by this or by that,

18:25.115 --> 18:50.558
and I would get going only then after six months, 
and I wanted to have a little overlap, means six

18:25.115 --> 18:50.558
plus 15 months is already 21 months, so two years 
seemed just right. And so I began to prepare for

18:50.538 --> 19:16.544
that, prepare proposals, and also learn about the 
carbon-14 method because that became known at

18:50.538 --> 19:16.544
that time through Stema Nielsen's efforts and 
gave a new dimension, really, to the question

18:50.538 --> 19:16.544
about the tropical ocean.

19:16.604 --> 19:17.405
Should I continue? Sure. I went to, I participated 
in a course on the carbon-fault technique by Simon

19:19.175 --> 19:29.811
Edison, so I got in.

19:36.682 --> 19:43.933
I learned all the tricks from the grand man himself 
and of course also became a little indoctrinated

19:36.682 --> 19:43.933
in the good sense of the word. I could participate 
in the Bergen Symposium in 1957, fall of 57, which

19:45.702 --> 20:12.688
was the first meeting by people working on 
productivity with a new tool and exchanging

19:45.702 --> 20:12.688
ideas, and it was an enormously successful, 
important milestone, a very successful

19:45.702 --> 20:12.688
symposium and a really important milestone in 
phytoplankton oceanography, so to speak. where I

20:13.377 --> 20:16.682
learned about the Bermuda results. Reiser told me 
about it and said, well, had I known, we could have

20:16.702 --> 20:21.949
invited you to Bermuda, which was too late, of 
course. But at any rate, I benefited very greatly

20:21.969 --> 20:27.777
from what I learned at that meeting, what Reiser 
told me. And then in early 1958, went to India to

20:27.817 --> 20:35.848
work on the tropical ocean. That was the subject. 
Seasonal study. in place. The tropical ocean, of

20:42.547 --> 20:52.476
course, by definition has no seasons, but I wanted 
to repeat Lohmann's work cast into more modern

20:42.547 --> 20:52.476
terms. Now, without going into all the detail, I 
state largely in Cochin, what is now known as

20:54.158 --> 21:08.612
Cochin on the southwest coast of India, but run 
into many difficulties of a technical term.

21:08.845 --> 21:11.329
Working conditions, for example, were very 
difficult. In effect, I had to do a lot of chemical

21:12.291 --> 21:24.471
work, starting from salinity, titrations, 
through nutrient analysis, into chlorophyll

21:12.291 --> 21:24.471
determination, and of course phytoplankton 
counting, too. But for all these two years, I

21:25.052 --> 21:27.236
didn't have running water. But I had to do 
chemistry out of water buckets, and not even

21:27.696 --> 21:31.603
enough water in the dry season. So it was really 
very difficult to do. Another difficulty was that

21:35.525 --> 21:44.616
the research vessel, which was run by a Norwegian 
aid project, was out of commission for seven out of

21:35.525 --> 21:44.616
12 months. And of course, if you make a seasonal 
study, it is a little difficult. Five months on a

21:48.341 --> 21:51.064
stretch, that vessel was not available. So I had to 
make do with other vessels or bottoms. Then there

21:57.712 --> 22:03.439
was a general attitude by the Indian researchers

22:04.347 --> 22:06.389
It was not very easy. Of course, to live there in 
those years was not easy either. Not only no air

22:11.434 --> 22:16.439
condition, but no refrigerator even, and 
loneliness. So it was not very happy years.

22:21.944 --> 22:30.793
I forgot to mention, among the sort of objective 
difficulties, owing to a slight mistake by by a

22:31.415 --> 22:40.590
clerk at the Indian Embassy in Bonn, I could not get 
hold of my scientific luggage, which were five

22:31.415 --> 22:40.590
crates, for five months. So for five months, they 
were just sitting in the customs and couldn't be

22:40.630 --> 22:46.499
released. And it took them five months to 
straighten out that red tape. And during these

22:52.576 --> 22:55.600
five months, well, there's some good always, of 
course. During these five months, I read the

22:55.620 --> 23:01.309
literature, the local literature, which I had not 
had time to do beforehand. In a way, I went a little

23:01.489 --> 23:06.997
unprepared, which I have found out later most 
people do. They have said, yeah, and then they have

23:07.057 --> 23:17.993
to do so many other things that they don't have time 
to read about, not only about the Hindu festivals,

23:07.057 --> 23:17.993
but also about the ordinary oceanography. But in 
addition, of course, by being at the place, I could

23:18.850 --> 23:41.226
read the local literature, which was in sort of 
gray literature or manuscripts not yet published

23:18.850 --> 23:41.226
and papers by the Department of Fisheries and what 
have you, which all contained original data, so

23:18.850 --> 23:41.226
that I had lots of original data and could plot, and 
I had enough time to plot all these, and they all

23:18.850 --> 23:41.226
didn't hang together. It was very, very strange, 
and I couldn't make sense of it. But then when I made

23:47.268 --> 23:54.777
my first cruise in August of 58, then it suddenly 
fell into place. This was upwelling. that was in

23:57.157 --> 24:03.248
effect, not in effect, I did discover one of the 
major upwelling regions of the globe. All the

24:03.869 --> 24:15.009
southwest, all the west coast of India is a major 
upwelling area, which nobody had known before,

24:03.869 --> 24:15.009
which of course took care of the idea of working in 
the, the typical tropical ocean. It wasn't

24:15.029 --> 24:15.951
typical. It was a strongly seasonal upwelling 
region, but of course it was interesting enough. I

24:23.043 --> 24:30.453
published on this right away, of course, but in 
hindsight it was in the wrong place, in the wrong

24:23.043 --> 24:30.453
journal. It was about the hydrography of 
fisheries, I believe, of the southwest coast of

24:30.473 --> 24:43.171
India, published in a first issue of a new 
biological journal. It came out in 59, and none of

24:43.812 --> 24:51.683
the people who went on to the Indian Ocean 
Expedition two years later had read that paper. so

24:52.051 --> 25:06.231
that all the ships working in the ocean stopped 
sampling when they crossed the Indian Shelf,

24:52.051 --> 25:06.231
because everybody knew nothing went on on the 
Indian Shelf, and all the exciting parts, the

24:52.051 --> 25:06.231
exciting regions, the western side of the Arabian 
Sea. And up to this day, no physical oceanography

25:07.172 --> 25:19.189
work of any quality has been done on the Indian 
Shelf, because afterwards the Suez Canal was

25:07.172 --> 25:19.189
closed, and so... Well, as I said, I published in 
the- made a very meritorious publication, I'm

25:20.317 --> 25:33.198
still very proud of, but because it was published 
at the- in the wrong place and perhaps in the wrong-

25:20.317 --> 25:33.198
at the wrong time to- that was it. Had I gone to a 
congress, of course, and had given speeches, it

25:33.399 --> 25:44.677
would have been different, but of course I 
couldn't get from there to New York.

25:44.697 --> 25:46.881
Now, yeah, had I gone to a congress, There was a big 
Congress in 1959, the first international

25:47.114 --> 25:54.438
Congress on Oceanography held in New York, to 
which I couldn't go. But at that Congress, the

25:55.240 --> 25:59.875
Department of Oceanography here in Seattle began 
to look around for a new biologist because their

26:00.260 --> 26:14.483
biological oceanographer had not panned out, had 
not published and had to go after his six years, was

26:00.260 --> 26:14.483
not promoted, and so they wanted to replace him. 
And Ratri, who happens now to be chairman, talked

26:15.364 --> 26:27.904
around and asked, do you know somebody, and ran 
into Krai, and Krai said, sure, I have somebody

26:15.364 --> 26:27.904
who's in India and who might be interested. And so I 
got the advertisement, and would I be interested

26:29.015 --> 26:34.603
to apply? and to cut this story short I did apply 
because in Germany there was still no position and

26:35.647 --> 27:04.388
although I was sort of assured that I wouldn't have 
to starve it was clear that in order to enter the

26:35.647 --> 27:04.388
university career I would still have many many 
years of waiting without lecturing without well

26:35.647 --> 27:04.388
just work on my own and I thought I was not old enough 
to shoulder responsibility and perhaps begin

26:35.647 --> 27:04.388
lecturing and so I wrote to Seattle and said, yes, I 
would like to apply, but since I had burned my

27:05.667 --> 27:25.547
fingers in India so badly, I didn't want to go right 
away, sign my contract while still in India, but

27:05.667 --> 27:25.547
suggested, asked, could I come over and look at the 
situation over, and that suited them eminently

27:05.667 --> 27:25.547
because they, of course, didn't want to buy 
somebody either whom they had never seen. So

27:25.587 --> 27:35.337
immediately after returning from India in spring 
of 1960, I went here for six weeks and liked it very

27:25.587 --> 27:35.337
much. And they liked me too, and so that was it. And I 
appeared on the scene here in autumn of 1960. The

27:43.311 --> 27:48.128
reason why I came here was the unsatisfactory 
situation in Germany. But more importantly, the

27:49.694 --> 28:02.761
positive aspect that the philosophy here, the 
definition of oceanography, which is really due

27:49.694 --> 28:02.761
to Barnes, Fleming, and Barnes and Rattray, was 
very much the one I was used to. It was not marine

28:02.781 --> 28:08.412
biology or biology of marine organisms, but it was 
really oceanography. And they offered me a

28:10.012 --> 28:17.064
position of responsibility and I also could enter 
the teaching career right away. So it was really

28:17.285 --> 28:27.042
more the positive aspect than the fact that in 
Germany I would just have to do research, continue

28:17.285 --> 28:27.042
to do research. But the upshot was that because of 
all the duties piled upon me, the plankton work

28:28.456 --> 28:36.885
from the Indian Ocean was never published. All the 
samples had been counted, all the analysis done,

28:36.986 --> 28:43.433
but I had never had time to publish, which is sad in a 
way. But I had never had the three months or so which

28:43.993 --> 28:50.000
I would have needed to publish. So that is still 
there.

28:55.647 --> 28:57.028
Are you ready to begin the Seattle career? Yes. OK.
