00:03.170 --> 00:09.336
If you had total authority, how organizationally 
would you place TTI?

00:14.120 --> 00:31.557
Well, TTI, I'm unbiased in this question because 
I've always fought to have TTI recognized as a part

00:14.120 --> 00:31.557
of the system, just like other parts of the system, 
T's, Ag Experiment Station, those. In reporting

00:32.937 --> 00:38.384
through some manner to the chancellor's office. 
We have gone the other direction.

00:46.193 --> 00:56.866
I think that there have been proposals to put

00:46.193 --> 00:56.866
some of the system parts back under the 
university. I think that the system has grown so

00:57.407 --> 01:01.392
big now that that's not a feasible solution. It's 
not feasible to put them back under. Back under a

01:05.376 --> 01:13.446
university because it seems to me we've always had 
the problem of who is really running this ship? Is

01:13.546 --> 01:27.464
this a system run by the president of the 
university or is it a system run by a system

01:13.546 --> 01:27.464
chancellor with presidents and directors of 
agencies? And I know that while organizationally

01:27.544 --> 01:32.070
on the chart, TTI with its little bitty operation 
is basically the equivalent of the university.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.129
Everybody, including us, know that's not so. We 
are not first among equals. We are the last among

01:45.974 --> 01:49.277
equals in that regard. But we don't have the same 
kind of problems. And they don't need to all be

01:53.061 --> 01:56.505
addressed the same way. Is there any advice that 
you would give to TTI today for the future if you

01:57.363 --> 02:04.793
were hired as its consultant? Yeah, the first 
thing I'd say is let's not try to follow all of the

02:07.116 --> 02:16.869
guidelines of the issue we were just talking 
about, and that is of recruiting people. Let's try

02:17.810 --> 02:26.121
to identify the people that we think we really 
would like to have for the purposes that we want to

02:17.810 --> 02:26.121
have those people here. get the best people we can 
and not go through the torturing process that

02:26.843 --> 02:55.112
makes it so difficult

02:26.843 --> 02:55.112
to get a decision for them that they yes they would 
really like to come here and go through all this

02:26.843 --> 02:55.112
process or secondly that we have end up with people 
who are average and that's all and uh if we can if we

02:26.843 --> 02:55.112
can stay out of that the best way we can and stay out 
of the courthouse, I think we'll be miles ahead.

03:04.151 --> 03:04.611
OK. I've just about finished the questions I could 
think of. What have we left out that we should have

03:08.095 --> 03:10.498
included? I think it's been pretty thorough. 
You've asked me more than I can respond to, I think,

03:13.622 --> 03:18.348
what it is. So concluding questions that I ask 
everybody. What has it meant to you that you

03:24.337 --> 03:27.221
attended Texas A&M? Well, I don't think I would 
have been nearly as successful in any endeavor

03:29.283 --> 03:39.897
that I went into had I not attended Texas A&M. I 
think A&M was a good crucible that allowed me to try

03:40.037 --> 03:53.635
to get an education that I could make use of and 
would give me some benefits of trying to deal with

03:53.800 --> 04:23.098
the difficult problems that I'm going to have to 
face what's going to have to face in the future of my

03:53.800 --> 04:23.098
career and I think A&M has meant more than just to my 
ability to make a living coming here it's I think

03:53.800 --> 04:23.098
the whole process of having pride in an 
institution is uh is worth a great deal if you can't

04:23.821 --> 04:50.436
go to a place and spend your life and then say hey 
this was a great place to be you started out in the

04:23.821 --> 04:50.436
wrong place i think i think a m has done it not only 
for me but i think it's done that same thing for

04:23.821 --> 04:50.436
others as well all right next the last question 
somebody walks up to you and hands you a check for a

04:23.821 --> 04:50.436
million dollars with one condition You have to 
pass it on to Texas A&M. You can define Texas A&M

04:53.144 --> 04:55.226
however you want to. And the only condition is 
you've got to pass it on, but you get to decide what

04:56.467 --> 05:01.673
they do with it. What would you tell them to do with 
your big gift? Well,

05:07.119 --> 05:12.746
I've not really faced that problem yet. Let me 
think about that just a moment.

05:18.612 --> 05:20.254
One thing that I think we need to do with it, and a 
million dollars is not going to solve the problem,

05:21.584 --> 05:48.739
but it would help a whole lot, is that we need to have 
some

05:21.584 --> 05:48.739
funds available to award

05:21.584 --> 05:48.739
promising young faculty that we think we can 
identify that are going to be the stars in 15 years

05:21.584 --> 05:48.739
from now. in this organization to be sure that 
they're not bled away from us because we can't do

05:49.377 --> 06:00.908
something for them to convince them to stay here. 
And I think that if we can get the right people and

06:02.149 --> 06:11.758
keep the right people, there's no end of what we can 
do. But that, I think, is a real difficult thing for

06:12.439 --> 06:18.304
us to do is to continue to be able to do that. I think 
we've been very fortunate in the past and been able

06:19.830 --> 06:31.229
to keep a bunch of people that had better 
opportunity or more financially better

06:19.830 --> 06:31.229
opportunities than a lot of other places. I think 
that might be the first place I'd put it. Last

06:36.177 --> 06:36.878
question. What feelings do you carry in your heart 
for Texas A&M now? Very good. Great feelings for

06:43.208 --> 06:44.470
A&M. I thought it's of all it's done and for the 
opportunities that it has to continue to be a, a

06:46.752 --> 06:53.140
major part. And I think that I've got hopes that 
that's even going to be more rather than less in the

06:53.160 --> 06:58.327
future. As we, one of the things that growth, 
although I'm not a real growth proponent, but

06:59.088 --> 07:14.548
growth has brought us, it's brought us visibility 
in the sense that, uh, we are now one of the two

06:59.088 --> 07:14.548
flagship universities in the state. And, uh, For 
most of my views, we may be the leading flagship

07:16.773 --> 07:30.148
university in the state because of the different 
things that we do and do quite well. Now, I know

07:30.168 --> 07:43.983
we're not ranked as high out of many of our academic 
departments as University of Texas is, but I think

07:30.168 --> 07:43.983
that there's a whole lot of inertia in that process 
as well. Let's quit there.
