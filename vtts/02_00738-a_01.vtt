WEBVTT

00:01.297 --> 00:06.224
Dr. Gammon, could you give me your full name and 
date and place of birth? That's easy. Full name.

00:09.529 --> 00:10.711
First name, Samuel. Sam for short. Ray, R-H-E-A. 
You try to spell that Ray, you get into trouble

00:18.963 --> 00:21.606
ordinarily. What happened was, originally, that 
was R-E-A when that branch of family lived in

00:22.267 --> 00:28.857
Scotland. Well they got in some kind of a religious 
row up there as the Scots are always doing and they

00:29.242 --> 00:39.855
finally moved over to Ireland and that's where 
they picked up the H in R-H-E-A.

00:42.739 --> 00:44.341
And when were you born? 1889, 26 November. And 
place of birth? Southwest Virginia, county with

00:51.550 --> 00:55.435
W-Y-T-H-E named for old man George who signed the 
Declaration of Independence. I see. Near any

01:01.378 --> 01:09.029
particular community or was this a farm or a... 
Small town, about possibly a thousand people at

01:01.378 --> 01:09.029
most. I see. Tom's name was Rural Retreat. Rural 
Retreat. Just off of the main highway which goes

01:15.559 --> 01:24.291
north of us for about a mile and can be so named that 
in making the long jaunt for that day, 40 miles or

01:25.030 --> 01:35.241
so, between Wytheville, the county seat of our 
county, and Marion, the county seat of the next

01:25.030 --> 01:35.241
adjoining, Smith County. When they got overtaken 
by bad roads and couldn't make it, they pulled off

01:35.801 --> 01:50.156
the main highway for about a mile to the south to 
this little settlement that came to be called

01:35.801 --> 01:50.156
Rural Retreat. It's a very pleasant name. Been 
that ever since. In fact, it's on the northern one.

01:54.325 --> 01:58.309
on the Norfolk and Western, so labeled on the 
railroad decision right now. May I speak? Sir, go

01:59.890 --> 02:02.433
ahead. A friend, a cousin of ours, told him that he 
wouldn't for anything live in the town that

02:03.894 --> 02:17.608
sounded as though you were gargling when you gave 
the name. Oh my goodness. Could I have your full

02:19.730 --> 02:23.814
name, Mrs. Gammon, and your date, and place of 
birth? Ellen. Ellen? Yeah, L-E-N. Uh, maiden name

02:27.496 --> 02:31.441
R-O-T-H-E. Rothy? Rothy. Of Danish. Danish 
extraction. Which I'm proud of. Her father and

02:39.471 --> 02:45.999
mother were both born in Denmark and at different 
times came over here and us went to marry them. I

02:46.420 --> 02:46.920
see. Yes, father came over because he was a child of 
old age and uh, He had very few connections. And it

02:54.445 --> 03:01.191
almost takes, in one of those countries over 
there, it almost takes a pool to get somewhere. And

03:01.891 --> 03:07.416
so he did get somewhere, but he thought he'd have a 
better opportunity and had friends over here. And

03:07.957 --> 03:09.758
so he came here. And he was a distant, distant, 
distant cousin of my mother's. My mother was tired

03:16.604 --> 03:20.728
of the small town young men who were courting her, 
and she wanted to get away. And she read the remark,

03:24.636 --> 03:29.943
oh, if I only knew anyone in America. And an elderly 
cousin of hers said, why, you do, you know, the

03:30.404 --> 03:47.226
Henrietta, or Yetta, as they called her, Rothi, or 
Rothi, as they said in Denmark, with a R down there

03:30.404 --> 03:47.226
in the throat. And so Mother wrote to this 
Henrietta Rothi, And she, elderly, did not

03:51.556 --> 03:57.905
answer, but had her son answer. And so my father 
answered. And after a correspondence of a couple

04:00.248 --> 04:10.923
of years, during which period, he sent mother, 
what was that old? A couple of old monthly

04:12.465 --> 04:14.548
magazines. Century, I believe, is one. And 
another one. And mother had read a good bit of

04:18.455 --> 04:26.626
Shakespeare before she ever came over here, which 
you can't say for a good many of the people out there

04:18.455 --> 04:26.626
in it. And it wasn't that nasty. But that's true. 
And so after some months, I would say about four

04:32.875 --> 04:42.187
months, they decided to marry. And they were a 
very, very happy couple, weren't they Ray? Yes,

04:45.712 --> 04:46.453
they were. Dr. Gammon has often called my father a 
saint. But he didn't look saintly. He was

04:55.154 --> 04:59.199
well-built and always smiling. But the Danes are 
like that, too. They smile a lot. You remember?

05:04.025 --> 05:04.726
Yeah. Where were you born? I was born in Chicago, 
and I don't like it a bit. But I couldn't help it. My

05:10.053 --> 05:10.954
parents were there. And your birthday? June 5, 
1989. I'm a few months older than Ray, so I'm

05:16.606 --> 05:21.113
bossing him now. Dr. Gamow, do you remember 
anything from your childhood that stands out in

05:23.316 --> 05:29.445
your mind that might be of interest to you? Yes, I 
think that I remember best when my father, knowing

05:29.465 --> 05:36.194
that it was part of Mother's plan. Mother died when 
I was only six years old. And part of her plan was

05:38.979 --> 05:42.023
that I should have a Shetland pony. And he 
proceeded to get me one. And I thought quite a lot of

05:45.462 --> 05:50.187
that pony, who did most everything to me that he 
shouldn't have done. He bit me once and kicked me

05:50.227 --> 05:55.593
once and threw me several times. Oh, my goodness. 
His name was Sheik, S-H-E-I-K. He came from the

05:58.776 --> 06:03.461
Sunnyside Pony Farm, Monmouth, Illinois. I still 
remember that. That's amazing. And where did you

06:08.467 --> 06:10.429
two meet? Beg your pardon? Where did you and your 
wife meet? In Baltimore. In Baltimore. Johns

06:14.062 --> 06:15.303
Hopkins Library. And the library. She was a 
librarian. Oh, my goodness. I said a library

06:18.968 --> 06:21.731
assistant is the correct name. When I often say 
that I thought a great deal of Johns Hopkins and the

06:23.053 --> 06:29.041
value of that library. And when I left, I knew I 
couldn't take the library, so I took the librarian

06:29.661 --> 06:33.927
as the next best bet. We were married. We were 
married. He used to say, I corralled him there. And

06:40.728 --> 06:49.218
I said, you didn't run very fast, so he changed it to 
say that he wanted to take the books, but he

06:40.728 --> 06:49.218
couldn't, so he took the librarian. I think he got 
cheated on that. Could you tell us about your

06:53.203 --> 07:00.853
education, say, beginning with when you first 
started formal schooling and, say, bringing it on

06:53.203 --> 07:00.853
to your Ph.D.? Small country high school. Where, 
in Virginia? Virginia. In Virginia? Yes. Rural

07:08.234 --> 07:09.315
Retreat High School. Still doing business, the 
old stand. Though I think it's deteriorated a good

07:13.038 --> 07:14.800
deal. That's my private opinion, but that doesn't 
count. That's your age, that's that. Being an old

07:20.305 --> 07:26.851
man isn't what it used to be, I'd say.

07:27.271 --> 07:30.755
And then did you go on to college immediately after 
high school? After high school, I went straight to

07:30.775 --> 07:35.659
Washington League University at Lexington, 
Virginia. And that town of Lexington is steeped in

07:36.010 --> 07:45.303
the reputation and lore and prestige of great men. 
Robert Edward Lee, President of Washington Lee

07:46.165 --> 07:50.391
for five years. Stonewall Jackson is buried 
there. And you can't, well you can't tell those

07:52.874 --> 08:02.688
Lexingtonians very much about the Civil War or any 
of those fellas. Oh my. You've got your... Lee is

08:06.284 --> 08:13.033
buried there on the campus in the Memorial Chapel, 
which he built while he was president. The

08:13.053 --> 08:22.106
mausoleum, where he and most of his family are 
buried right now, have been for years, is there on

08:13.053 --> 08:22.106
the campus. It's a very beautiful crypt there. And 
you were there for four years? Five. Five. Not

08:29.837 --> 08:34.283
because I flunked, but because I got smart. and 
crammed, loaded on, took my A.B. in three years. By

08:39.151 --> 08:47.063
the time I got through I wasn't so well satisfied 
with what I was getting out of it and so I took two

08:39.151 --> 08:47.063
more easy years for a master's degree. I think I got 
more out of those last two than I did out of the first

08:47.704 --> 08:50.908
three. You will note he didn't have to take the five 
years. He elected to take them and could have

08:57.558 --> 09:02.425
gotten through with an A.B. in The three years, but 
he loaded too much. And what were your specialties

09:06.779 --> 09:08.642
in history then? Your favorites. I think I liked 
possibly best, of course American history was

09:12.868 --> 09:18.095
always a favorite of mine. As a youngster I read a 
great deal and my father with an eye on that saw that

09:18.796 --> 09:27.067
I had plenty of books. I remember one Christmas I 
got 11 books a set of three, Plutarch's Lives and

09:31.688 --> 09:38.698
numerous others. My

09:38.739 --> 09:47.391
fondness for reading gave me a slant in the 
direction of history very naturally. Then you

09:47.772 --> 09:53.080
went from Washington and Lee to Johns Hopkins or 
was there an interval? No, after I finished in

09:53.360 --> 09:59.890
Lexington at Washington and Lee I wanted to look 
around a bit. I wanted to think a bit of what I was

10:04.035 --> 10:05.697
going to do next. I thought I wanted to teach. So I 
took, I waited for a while and in that while I took

10:08.921 --> 10:17.773
two years of teaching high school teaching. Where 
were you teaching then? At Austin College. At

10:24.602 --> 10:26.885
Austin College, yes, up here at Sherman. Because 
an old friend of my family The man under whom I got my

10:30.751 --> 10:44.867
start in Greek was head of the Latin Greek 
department at Austin College and it was through

10:30.751 --> 10:44.867
his influence that I got the history department 
there at Austin College where I went in fall of

10:30.751 --> 10:44.867
1922. No. Earlier.

10:49.413 --> 10:51.775
Because we were married in 1918.

10:55.019 --> 10:56.501
You must have gone there in 12. Mm-mm. No, no. I was 
still in Washington, D.C. in 12. Well, then you had

11:01.954 --> 11:06.099
two there before you came to Hopkins. And Hopkins 
was 1912 is when you came to Hopkins. Because you

11:11.726 --> 11:14.369
were there 13, 14, 15, 16. No, 1912 to Hopkins. 
1913. Because you were there five years and then.

11:19.395 --> 11:21.458
Yes, that probably was. Yes. And then on to John 
Hopkins then? Or let's see. Yes, actor Sherman.

11:28.526 --> 11:28.806
Right. Yep. After prep school in there at Sherman 
College. It was called Austin College in Sherman,

11:34.473 --> 11:45.307
but they had a prep department, and that is why Dr. 
Gammon said high school, but it was really better

11:34.473 --> 11:45.307
than high school. That was a Presbyterian school, 
right? It is. Yes. Still is. Now, what made you

11:49.492 --> 11:54.599
decide to go back and work for a Ph.D.? Well, if you 
were going, I could see easily enough. But if you

11:58.332 --> 12:06.363
were going to get ahead in the teaching 
profession, you had to have more than an M.A. M.A.s

12:06.383 --> 12:08.886
were just common speed tracks, so to speak. Good 
M.A.s at that then.

12:14.654 --> 12:16.857
And how long did you spend at Johns Hopkins?

12:19.501 --> 12:20.462
I can tell you that. It would be about four years. 
No, it was there the total of five years. Wait a

12:27.003 --> 12:28.785
minute. You came in 19... Did you come there in 
1913? No, I came there in 1913. Oh, that's what

12:37.695 --> 12:41.179
we're... Oh, my. We're living in the present, you 
see. So that's why we're a little hazy right in

12:43.702 --> 12:46.746
there. But he had been there three years and then 
went off to... This First World War, as we called it

12:55.657 --> 13:01.185
now, as we call it now, it was the war. But now it's 
the First World War. And he then got up to his first

13:03.969 --> 13:07.915
lieutenancy. And then we were married at that 
time, when he was just a second Louis. And then he

13:17.950 --> 13:24.600
came back after the war was over in his discharge as 
a first lieutenant. and finished the two years to

13:24.833 --> 13:28.557
get his PhD degree. See, I was watching then, so 
that's why I know it so well. Where did you do most of

13:32.901 --> 13:35.203
your military service? At Camp Lee. Camp Lee in 
Virginia. At Camp Hancock. I was regimental

13:42.210 --> 13:45.193
personnel agent at Camp Hancock, Georgia. But you 
were at Washington, over in Washington that day.

13:50.858 --> 13:52.419
During the first two years of the war. That's where 
you got lieutenancy. over in Washington, what was

13:54.365 --> 13:58.851
the name of the place in Washington? Because you 
used to commute and come over to court me. So what's

14:04.138 --> 14:06.761
the name of the place? Oh, that camp, Camp Lee, just 
outside of. No, that's Petersburg. Wait a minute,

14:11.668 --> 14:15.553
wait a minute.

14:15.573 --> 14:18.157
Anyway, it's called Fort something now. And right 
outside of Washington, everybody knows the

14:18.918 --> 14:22.262
place. We can't remember. And then he was caught at 
me right in there. While he was there, it was just a,

14:26.863 --> 14:32.210
what, a 40-minute ride by train? And officers 
counted the days. That's it. We were encouraged to

14:35.194 --> 14:39.199
light out at noon on Saturdays and not show up again 
the Monday. And I'd grab the next train to

14:40.040 --> 14:42.743
Baltimore.

14:44.826 --> 14:46.268
And then he came back. Then he was sent to Camp Lee. 
which was not too far away from Baltimore either.

14:52.902 --> 14:58.831
So you see, the fates were against him and with me, 
as you see. And he could come up there, but not quite

14:59.372 --> 15:03.838
as often. And then he got sent to Camp Hancock down 
at a bus to Georgia. And that was impossible, so he

15:09.106 --> 15:12.390
got too lonesome. And I didn't like him being 
lonesome, so I decided that it was all right. He

15:17.217 --> 15:18.439
asked me, of course. to marry him. So I thought it 
was all right. I didn't want him to be lonesome. I

15:23.947 --> 15:25.249
think that's why I married you. Come to think of it. 
Yes, Ellen came down on a train from Washington to

15:27.071 --> 15:33.679
Augusta. I met the train. And we went from there to 
the Presbyterian manse. And we were married by Dr.

15:38.144 --> 15:43.751
Joe Sevier, Presbyterian minister for the First 
Church in Houston. First Church in Augusta, I

15:45.733 --> 15:48.156
mean. That's over, oh, they hopped out there, if 
you remember. And you finished your Ph.D. in 1921?

15:57.363 --> 15:57.723
No. 1980, 1918?

16:03.990 --> 16:04.971
Finished his Ph.D.? 22 was the grade who you find 
listed in the Hopkins catalog, I think. 22. Oh,

16:10.037 --> 16:13.301
well, that's because it was... 1922. Well, yes, 
because...

16:20.823 --> 16:21.604
was finished then. You know, I said, first he came. 
I don't know why we're so hazy about that period.

16:26.649 --> 16:27.690
Too long ago. That's right. No. No. He was there for 
three years, I think. And then the war came. And

16:35.938 --> 16:37.920
that kept him away for two years. And during that 
period, we were married. And then he came back. And

16:41.644 --> 16:49.952
in 22, he got his PhD with that dissertation. which 
is now being republished. Then you went from there

16:54.639 --> 16:58.824
back to Austin College again after you got your 
PhD? To the Collegiate Department. Yes. I had a

17:03.690 --> 17:10.338
little experience before that at Austin College 
as assistant to the principal of the prep

17:03.690 --> 17:10.338
department. But this time they'd had a sample of me 
and thought they could stand it so they made me head

17:11.039 --> 17:19.129
of the history department, history and 
government. Did you simply, how did you go about

17:20.999 --> 17:23.682
getting that job again? Did you, after you 
finished your PhD, did you write them or write your

17:23.722 --> 17:28.748
friends that were still there? Oh, no. My friend 
was there on the job all the time. He was head of the

17:31.331 --> 17:33.693
Latin Greek department. And the president also 
knew the family. See, they all came through that

17:37.277 --> 17:42.383
little plateau. The president of Austin College 
then had his degree from King College of Bristol,

17:42.403 --> 17:47.989
Tennessee. From Kingsport. Which is next door to 
us. And

17:50.750 --> 17:56.456
you were, how long were you at Austin College? 
Four. Four years. Four years. Came down here from

17:58.298 --> 17:59.699
there. And how did you go about coming, how did it 
happen that you came to A&M? Oh, better.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.330
Well, they'd had a sample of me and thought they 
could stand it. No, that was Austin College, but

18:10.351 --> 18:12.172
here. Here at A&M. How did you find out about... He 
didn't. He didn't. No, people that had degrees...

18:19.724 --> 18:24.411
or of any account, good degrees, don't go 
scrambling around for jobs. They offered jobs.

18:26.233 --> 18:27.135
I'll tell you how that was. Charles E. Friley was 
dean of the School of Arts and Sciences here at A&M.

18:33.604 --> 18:35.146
And it was through him. They came looking for you? 
He wrote to Hopkins, to various colleges, because

18:36.909 --> 18:41.956
he wanted a PhD. Wanted a good PhD. Yes, and so he got 
led to him. We were in Virginia at the time for a

18:46.963 --> 18:49.427
week. But in the summer, of course, summers, quite 
a few years. And what did you do when you first came

18:55.260 --> 18:57.404
to A&M? Were you open to the position? Same thing I 
would still be doing if I were not retired. Head of

19:03.413 --> 19:04.855
History Department. You were hired as the head of 
the department. Oh, yes. I wouldn't have taken

19:07.820 --> 19:09.062
anything less. Yes, I understand. Because I was 
still a big boy up at Austin College. I see. And can

19:15.212 --> 19:17.355
you describe your... First impressions, 
earliest impressions of the campus when you came

19:17.588 --> 19:23.456
and of the department? I'm too busy. I was quite 
adjustable, adaptable as taking in a new

19:25.640 --> 19:44.727
situation and it fitted how I was on the campus, our 
contacts, and the fact that Friday as dean of the

19:25.640 --> 19:44.727
School of Arts and Sciences gave me practically a 
free hand in organizing and offering the course

19:45.263 --> 19:47.805
that I thought the Department of History should 
have. So you made some changes when you came? Not

19:50.928 --> 19:52.329
very radical. I added some courses mostly. Gave it 
a little broader reach. Can you think of some of

19:58.975 --> 20:04.240
those that you added that you thought were 
necessary to the curriculum then? Oh, I couldn't

20:04.660 --> 20:06.562
do that without a catalog. Oh, I see. That's all 
right. I think

20:07.863 --> 20:13.768
I've been out of touch with it too long now. Know it 
as well as I once did. Mrs. Gammon,

20:16.128 --> 20:33.376
you were talking a moment ago about your 
impressions, some of the first impressions of the

20:16.128 --> 20:33.376
campus. Could you tell us a little bit about those? 
I didn't get that. Please. Could you tell us about

20:37.383 --> 20:40.448
your first impressions of the campus? Yeah, at the 
campus here? Yes, at the campus here at A&M. Your

20:44.154 --> 20:45.095
first impressions. You said it was friendly. 
Could you? Well, we've spent practically all our

20:46.777 --> 20:53.164
lives at educational institutions. So I didn't 
think this was wonderful, nor did I think it was

20:53.665 --> 20:57.950
nothing. I just took it for granted that it was like 
other colleges and universities, Johns Hopkins

20:58.390 --> 21:05.018
Universities and so on. And we were rather pleased 
to be given a house right on the campus, both

21:05.504 --> 21:23.691
because of seniority and because, no not 
seniority, you didn't have any seniority then,

21:05.504 --> 21:23.691
but because of his position. He was, the heads of 
departments had first choice, you see, and then

21:24.292 --> 21:28.879
professors and so on. And as the seniority 
counted, too, you see. Because once you got a

21:32.749 --> 21:35.792
house, you couldn't be pushed out of it. And so we 
had that house that was painted green. All the

21:40.437 --> 21:41.598
others were white. And it stood opposite the, it 
stood where the parking lot now is for the Raleigh,

21:42.279 --> 21:55.292
whatever you call it. Yes, right? Opposite there. 
Even the driveway that was the remains of an old

21:58.306 --> 22:06.959
road, we used it as a driveway to our garage. It was 
the remains of an old road. I don't know which one.

22:11.225 --> 22:12.147
But long ago. And probably before the college was 
starting. It was a college then. And it was rather

22:21.020 --> 22:25.326
pleasant to be right close on the campus. And those 
living on the campus had a certain prestige, too.

22:31.148 --> 22:33.871
So I didn't know that, but I see that now. And it was, 
we used the old college, what is now College Road.

22:41.077 --> 22:42.398
That was the only way into town. This Texas Avenue 
was just a muddy road. And we never used it. We went

22:49.724 --> 22:55.549
out by Westgate rather than by Eastgate. And many 
people didn't have cars when they came, but we did.

23:02.848 --> 23:09.798
We had bought a car up in Sherman and drove down here 
with our two boys. And

23:10.499 --> 23:22.617
it was very pleasant to be on the campus because, as 
I said before, the people were very welcoming. We

23:22.951 --> 23:31.421
didn't get hazed or beaten or anything like that 
because that system was in full swing when we came.

23:31.461 --> 23:37.028
And one might say right in there that that was one of 
the drawbacks. And they had it for quite a while,

23:37.589 --> 23:47.361
changing commandants and so on to get control of 
this. I think it is all right now, especially since

23:47.441 --> 23:50.865
the women got in. So there. You're talking about 
the students hazing. The students? Yes, when you

23:56.851 --> 24:01.156
were talking about nobody, you said something 
about nobody beat you or anything. Oh, no. We

24:01.977 --> 24:03.319
weren't hazed. No, it was just, I'm just taking 
off. Oh, I see. The student habit of hazing people.

24:09.846 --> 24:12.910
I couldn't imagine them hazing the faculty. No, 
they were the most welcoming, and we were not hazed

24:13.451 --> 24:20.599
in any way or made to feel new or anything like that. 
No, I was just poking a little fun at the hazing

24:20.967 --> 24:25.732
system. And I can't call it anything but the hazing 
system. Once in a while. Which lasted quite a long

24:29.777 --> 24:36.424
time and was a trouble to the administration. Now, 
it didn't affect the other administrators. That

24:39.788 --> 24:42.952
is, heads of departments were also 
administrative. What were your impressions of

24:44.053 --> 24:48.578
the students that you taught, Dr. Gammon? Put the 
marks around the mind, nothing very new about the

24:49.553 --> 24:54.319
type of preparation. Well, they were-. You didn't 
find them tremendously different from any that

24:56.942 --> 25:02.028
you'd ever taught before? Because I'd had four 
year sampling of them at Austin College. I thought

25:07.035 --> 25:14.183
maybe since you had been in the East you might have 
found them less well prepared or their

25:07.035 --> 25:14.183
backgrounds were not as good. Well, I think I would 
make that as one of my impressions when I was first

25:14.203 --> 25:19.510
at Austin College. that you got perhaps less 
well-prepared high school products. But I make

25:24.350 --> 25:28.254
that rather hesitantly. I would think that might 
have been a drawback because of the Texas rural

25:29.516 --> 25:35.523
school system at that time. Students had missed 
probably a lot.

25:41.810 --> 25:43.992
I think it was a drawback to the students. Oh, yes, 
ma'am. Not a drawback to the teachers, except that

25:44.673 --> 25:48.838
they had to work harder. to put it through the 
skulls. And, of course, here it was a school or

25:51.536 --> 26:05.514
college planned for a state college with cheaper 
tuition and so on. And up in Austin College was a

26:06.095 --> 26:16.528
Presbyterian school, and Presbyterians are 
known to be pretty well educated, at least their

26:06.095 --> 26:16.528
ministry is, and we're Presbyterians. There. Who 
were some of the people who you were most closely

26:20.408 --> 26:29.422
associated with and remember most favorably in 
the early years? All of them. All of them. Up there?

26:32.226 --> 26:33.929
Here, up there. Here, after we moved down here. 
Mostly

26:35.932 --> 26:41.280
the Presbyterian group. Yes, I think you're 
right. Oh, our neighbors. A few names. Tell me

26:45.106 --> 26:46.808
their names, if you can. Name some of them. I can do 
that, I believe, better because I think women are

26:47.982 --> 26:54.730
more socially inclined. I know that the Hedges, he 
was head of the chemistry department, lived right

26:54.750 --> 27:02.438
across the street from us. And when we went to town 
or anyplace else, we'd go out our back door because

27:02.458 --> 27:09.086
we lived on corners. And when Mrs. Hughes and I saw 
each other in town, we'd embrace just for fun

27:09.847 --> 27:17.095
because we... Didn't see each other because we 
went out the back way. But Ray helped Dr. Hedges

27:20.418 --> 27:23.981
when he had come. He limped. And he had been away for 
some surgery, perhaps. But anyway, some

27:31.888 --> 27:33.269
attention. And Ray met him and took him back to the 
campus. So we knew them pretty well. We knew the

27:42.478 --> 27:45.040
Seekies pretty well, Mr. Seekie. He was a 
forester, a state forester, . And I think you will

27:49.697 --> 27:54.482
find a good bit of records about him. We were, of 
course, close to them. We had young children, and

28:00.407 --> 28:04.691
they had an older boy who had retired. did very, 
very well in his line of work and retired early in

28:05.852 --> 28:10.236
Slimington Street. And then the people next door.

28:18.145 --> 28:22.890
And Mrs. Hughes was giving a party. And I remember 
she had a rooster she was going to make big, because

28:23.411 --> 28:29.538
it was a salad. Chicken salad. Chicken salad, 
rooster salad. And it got away from her and her

28:33.503 --> 28:37.007
black coat. And they were going around the house 
chasing it. And meanwhile, we had a dog. A fox

28:43.855 --> 28:45.156
terrier. A terrier. had adopted us. We didn't seek 
him, just like we didn't seek this job here. It came

28:52.341 --> 28:53.503
to us. And so Dr. Gammon said, stranger, get him. 
And a stranger. We called him a stranger, because

28:59.309 --> 29:01.091
he came to us. And so we just called him a stranger. 
And he loved us very much, and we him. And so he

29:06.438 --> 29:11.323
chased after the rooster, and just pinned the 
rooster down. But that's what he was. He had him by

29:13.045 --> 29:15.388
one wing, and that was it. But Mrs. Hughes doesn't 
remember that. She is, as I said, she just got her

29:18.188 --> 29:25.178
mind on a few things. And let me see who else. Oh, 
next door to them were the Reeds, which they were,

29:29.123 --> 29:35.031
we were at the same church, so we were pretty close 
there. Then the other direction, next to the

29:35.051 --> 29:44.143
Seakeys, was the Leland's.

29:45.693 --> 29:47.855
Leland, Leland. And their boy and our boy played 
together. Back of those two doors lived Dean

29:53.061 --> 29:56.044
Bolton. And he had a young son and older children 
who was practically a sidekick of our children.

30:04.794 --> 30:15.666
And Mrs. Bolton once said to me, she knew 
everything that happened in our house because she

30:04.794 --> 30:15.666
would hear it through Preston. And she said, 
you've got an Encyclopedia Britannica. That was

30:20.654 --> 30:24.420
the 1930 edition, I guess. And when our children 
would play, if there'd be some subject come up that

30:25.081 --> 30:42.126
should be questioned, as for instance, George 
Washington telephoning to his lieutenants and

30:25.081 --> 30:42.126
captain, I think it was Samory that said, or Billy 
that said, telephoning wasn't invented. Preston

30:43.748 --> 30:44.910
said. Yes, it was so. And so whoever it was, which of 
our two children, shot in and looked up in the

30:46.869 --> 30:53.357
inside computer. We did not buy the book of 
knowledge and those other infantile things. We

30:57.803 --> 31:04.071
gave them things that they'd have to work for to get 
their information. And so he really convinced his

31:04.691 --> 31:10.158
playmate. Now, that's another family. Let's see, 
then there were the, we didn't know them too much,

31:12.835 --> 31:18.063
the Nuck Walkers. And let's see, near them lived 
the Come and Dance. We got to be quite friendly, I

31:23.791 --> 31:30.040
especially, with the Come and Dance wives. I know 
they came to see us when they came back to college.

31:33.084 --> 31:33.865
Two of them did. And we had lost our older son then, 
and they remembered that. And let's see who else.

31:40.377 --> 31:45.223
Oh, of course, on the other end of the campus, we 
knew the Humberts very well. In fact, Humbert was

31:45.824 --> 31:55.456
quite influential in getting our son out of the 
State Department a Rotary Fellowship. And I

31:55.476 --> 32:06.049
always thought he came to us once, Dr. Humbert, and 
asked us, is there anything special you can tell us

31:55.476 --> 32:06.049
about Sam Ray? He was called Sam Ray then. 
combination of the two names. And is there

32:10.356 --> 32:13.879
anything special you can tell him as a son? I said, 
why, yes. After we lost our son, our elder son, his

32:16.301 --> 32:24.729
brother, his elder brother, he wrote to us every 
day. That's exactly what I wanted to know, said Dr.

32:24.789 --> 32:29.834
Humbert. And of course, that sort of settled it. I 
always told the Rotarians that they went around

32:32.756 --> 32:36.960
acting as though he was their son, and we were just 
an institution. So now, let me see. And at the other

32:43.484 --> 32:50.492
end of the campus, beside the Humberts, there 
were, let's see, who do we know over there? There

32:50.512 --> 32:51.913
was Cassians. The Cassians. SPEAKER 1. Cassians 
was head of the YMCA for a long time. SPEAKER 2. Yes,

32:58.040 --> 33:01.423
he was the YMCA director, and had been at Austin 
College. So Ray had some. SPEAKER 1. I had a finger

33:03.946 --> 33:05.648
in the pie getting him down here. influence in 
putting in a good word for him here. He was very much

33:09.938 --> 33:11.661
beloved. He was a very genial sort of person. Died 
in 52. They, I suppose, were our closest friends,

33:16.028 --> 33:20.334
because we were Presbyterians together. We'd 
been to Austin College together. And our

33:22.538 --> 33:25.883
children, though hers, theirs, were younger. 
Mason Lee Cashin is the younger of that. And he is

33:30.309 --> 33:31.691
quite prominent. He married Dr. Walton's, no wait 
a minute, Dr. Walton's granddaughter, Ethel

33:34.400 --> 33:47.715
Walton Burgess's daughter, who is now the second 
Mrs. Cashin. Let me see, who else was over there? Of

33:50.137 --> 33:51.519
course the Marshes. He was our doctor, Dr. J.E. 
Marsh. J.E. Marsh, that's right. He has a son who is

33:58.586 --> 34:02.871
Jack Marsh in practicing here, but he had died, but 
I think Mrs. Marsh is still living. Who else? I have

34:06.965 --> 34:08.747
to think about the camels. The camels were, he was 
head of the modern language. And oh, I forgot this.

34:17.140 --> 34:21.867
Some, he had a corner from us, the head of the 
English department. And we became very good

34:22.488 --> 34:25.913
friends. And when we moved out here, they put us off 
the campus so they could grow. and put so many other

34:31.319 --> 34:36.004
buildings on the places where we lived. They came 
and told you, you just have to move, right? Oh,

34:38.527 --> 34:39.368
yeah. Yeah, yeah, we just had to. They gave us a 
little warning. They didn't kick us out. No, we

34:43.233 --> 34:44.414
didn't hear them, Lord. They gave us, I think it was 
almost two years, because the semi's built down

34:44.655 --> 34:50.742
here, just on the next street. And they were about, 
let's see, 91, about nine years older than we, no?

34:58.471 --> 35:01.334
Five, six, seven, eight years older, I think I 
figured out. And they have both died. They were

35:06.620 --> 35:08.081
also from Virginia. So you see, we had so much in 
common with them. I don't know why I didn't mention

35:10.784 --> 35:12.526
them first. Then there were people in the 
experiment station, especially, bless their

35:13.247 --> 35:25.120
souls, the Sherwoods lived off on the road Jones 
Bridge, it was a Jones Bridge road they lived on, or

35:25.792 --> 35:29.377
the other road. They went out to the experiment 
station, the farms out there. But she was a great

35:35.565 --> 35:40.292
mixer, and we were very fond of them. They died too 
early in 57, 58. He

35:46.480 --> 35:54.651
died in 58, January 58, like the Harold Neckard. 
And she later. But they left. It doesn't pay to

36:00.794 --> 36:05.018
leave a place where you've lived a long time. 
Remember that, young man. If you've settled down a

36:07.261 --> 36:22.478
long time in one place, your roots are so 
established, and your whole life is sort of woven

36:07.261 --> 36:22.478
in with the life of the community, that you unravel 
the fabric if you move. We've seen a lot of that. And

36:23.829 --> 36:25.791
you'll lessen your roots if you're uprooted. 
Because we have seen many that have moved away and

36:26.371 --> 36:32.337
haven't lived long after that. Now, whether 
there's any medical connection or whether

36:32.778 --> 36:43.047
anybody would agree with me, there must be a 
psychological sort of influence. And so even

36:43.068 --> 36:50.895
though Delta Gamma had a good bit of property up 
there with County Virginia and in Smith County,

36:51.263 --> 36:57.349
And we have always thought of going back to 
Virginia, even though we expected to freeze to

36:51.263 --> 36:57.349
death every winter. The summers are glorious. 
Yes. Virginia is the southwestern part, and the

37:00.612 --> 37:04.396
altitude is around 3,000 feet. You get sure enough 
winter there. You're high up. I spent four years in

37:07.459 --> 37:09.461
Norfolk, Virginia. Oh, Norfolk? That's a little 
more than sea level. But we would go over there. I

37:16.548 --> 37:19.130
spent my weekends in Williamsburg, and I enjoyed 
Williamsburg. Oh, Williamsburg. That's

37:20.231 --> 37:20.832
different. I had to live in Norfolk because that's 
where I was in the service. I didn't like Norfolk,

37:25.944 --> 37:30.130
but the rest of the state was beautiful, 
absolutely beautiful. Especially the

37:30.470 --> 37:32.193
southwest. Our section is the prettiest part of 
Virginia, right through there. And that's where

37:37.500 --> 37:42.727
they, what's the name of that highway? No, Blue 
Ridge, the new scenic. road that runs down to

37:48.638 --> 37:55.348
Skyline Drive. And that's very near to us. But it 
deflects down into North Carolina a little before

37:59.194 --> 38:05.443
it gets to us up there. So we had always been in there 
with a family. And we would be near my family, who

38:09.308 --> 38:12.553
lived in the east. And coming back to noticing. the 
difference in the education of the young here that

38:16.786 --> 38:23.175
Eastern schools were better. We could see that. I 
could see it in all sorts of small ways. Nothing you

38:28.161 --> 38:31.666
really could put your finger on, but in small ways. 
I noticed it myself. I was born in Chicago, that

38:33.328 --> 38:35.131
place. And when I came, when my family moved east to 
Baltimore,

38:43.432 --> 38:46.635
I had a hard time in, of all things, mathematics. 
And now I'm doing the IRS for the family, which is

38:47.236 --> 38:52.762
sometimes pretty complicated. So I remember that 
as a fact. And let's see, we were talking about

38:56.826 --> 39:03.353
friends on the campus. Oh yeah, you used to play 
golf with Dr. Walton, with President Walton. Was

39:11.748 --> 39:13.911
it Richard? Once in a while. Duncan was head of 
subsistence. And Duncan Hall had been named for

39:21.821 --> 39:23.723
him. Well, we knew them very well. They lived over 
on the other end of the campus.

39:32.033 --> 39:35.978
Could you give me some personal remembrances of 
Dr. Walton? Personality? Anything interesting?

39:40.604 --> 39:41.125
Or humorous? Or? I would say he was, he was genial, 
friendly,

39:41.785 --> 39:52.805
with something of a sense of humor. And he was 
insistent that we were one family. That's good.

39:59.236 --> 40:00.478
You see, and we . That's the thing I remember sort of 
permeating his way. Otherwise, I don't, I can't

40:06.372 --> 40:10.956
think of anything bad to say about him. No, I'm not 
looking for anything bad. No. Mrs. Walton was

40:15.520 --> 40:19.884
lovely. I've never heard one word, even 
implication, against her. She died not very long

40:24.948 --> 40:26.390
ago. And, well, not very long ago, it's been four or 
five years. And they... Let's see. I think on the

40:37.515 --> 40:45.342
whole, now there were several people, as I said, 
without any degrees at all teaching here. You see?

40:46.663 --> 40:52.929
There was less, in a way, than that academic 
college of insurance. And Mrs. Humbert, whom I

40:53.309 --> 40:59.715
mentioned, I mentioned the Humberts a while ago, 
said, you will find this will be different. This is

40:59.755 --> 41:03.278
an agricultural state college. You'll find a 
difference from her experience. You'll see she

41:09.000 --> 41:09.980
was speaking. But I remember that so definitely. 
And it was, but nothing to bother one. We were busy,

41:16.827 --> 41:24.253
young parents, working hard in the department, 
working hard at home. We were too busy to talk about

41:24.734 --> 41:27.976
things. We had two boys in the local school. Yes, it 
consolidated. sent them to Bryan later for high

41:32.333 --> 41:38.560
school because they gave Latin in there. And it had 
a large curriculum. And we wanted ours to have a

41:44.327 --> 41:46.749
Latin background. And they had somebody, Mrs. 
Spriggs, Mrs. Rose Spriggs. I think she's not so

41:51.515 --> 41:54.919
well. She taught Latin to the group, to a few of the 
students. out at Consolidated High School, which

42:01.814 --> 42:09.642
was right three, oh, it was a block, two blocks from 
our home. So that was wonderful, you see. It was

42:12.324 --> 42:14.066
located on the campus then? Oh, Consolidated, oh, 
yes. Do you remember, was it here when you came

42:16.929 --> 42:19.031
here? Oh, yes. It was already here then. Oh, yes. 
Billy was in kindergarten then, but he started

42:22.854 --> 42:26.398
right in there. Both of them went through grade 
school there. And it was two blocks from us. Let's

42:31.227 --> 42:34.772
see, the Williamses, we knew the Earl Williamses, 
too. He was head of mechanical education? No.

42:39.138 --> 42:40.420
Industrial, I think. What is industrial 
education? Industrial education, that's right.

42:45.026 --> 42:49.633
And Jane Williams, we knew. They lived right back, 
practically in our backyard. We knew them very

42:52.697 --> 42:54.559
well. Jane especially. Jane died just a few months 
ago, Jane Williames. We were always doctor or

43:00.286 --> 43:06.674
mister and missus in those days. But before we ever 
left the campus, it was Ellen and Ray and Helen and

43:07.154 --> 43:17.386
Frank, the Frank Andersons. I forgot to mention 
them. Frank Anderson, he has a son who's an

43:19.569 --> 43:26.337
ophthalmologist. We knew him as a little 
red-headed boy before he was born. And but they

43:29.429 --> 43:32.692
are, they're lovely people. We knew them very 
well, too. And they moved over in the Siki house

43:34.975 --> 43:39.619
when the Sikis moved into Quality Row. They had a 
street back of our street that was called Quality

43:40.120 --> 43:49.990
Row, in a popular parlance. Am I speaking right? 
And it just, none of our streets had names. But they

43:56.837 --> 43:58.879
called that place Quality Row. Because here were 
the Boltons. And the Waltons lived in the big

44:03.977 --> 44:09.784
president's house, which burned down and has been 
rebuilt. But on Quality Road lived Big Comandant,

44:11.446 --> 44:23.559
who was always an army officer, colonel, and Dean, 
as he was then, Dean Bolton. We always called him

44:23.579 --> 44:26.202
Dean Bolton, though later he became president. We 
always called him Dean Bolton. And the forester,

44:28.306 --> 44:32.932
his forester, they moved over. She moved over 
there. She won't be on Quality Road. And that's all

44:36.135 --> 44:37.257
right, too. She was right cute. She said when he 
retired, her health was not good for many years.

44:45.947 --> 44:50.873
And they made several tries to get away from this 
place. They moved out to the West Coast to see how

44:51.414 --> 44:56.440
they liked that. That's where they had started and 
liked it. And then she said when they came back,

44:59.245 --> 45:04.731
nobody knew Paul there, their son. And I could 
understand that. They also tried to go up to

45:06.913 --> 45:11.639
Nebraska, their home state. And they didn't like 
the way the people they hired to help them. They

45:17.745 --> 45:24.553
wanted to sit down at the table and eat with them and 
play bridge with them and have all the company help

45:17.745 --> 45:24.553
the dishes. I remember Alice Siki saying that. She 
had quite a sense of humor, this persistent sort of

45:27.249 --> 45:38.343
humor, rather than specific jokes or specific 
points of humor. She said, when he retired, she

45:38.704 --> 45:42.088
said, he is retired. I'm just tired. So I have 
quoted her to many, many people. But I have always

45:49.137 --> 45:53.022
given credit to her and to those who knew her. And 
others, I have always said.
