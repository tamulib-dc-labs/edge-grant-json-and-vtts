WEBVTT

00:04.553 --> 00:06.676
Side 3 equipment section continued.

00:09.440 --> 00:20.936
The following sections of organizing are called 
44, radar on lower end, the radio on lower end,

00:09.440 --> 00:20.936
radar, IFF, RCM, sonar, functional components. 
Each of these sections initiated procurement

00:21.176 --> 00:34.375
requests using one, allowance list established 
by installation and maintenance, two, equipment

00:21.176 --> 00:34.375
characteristics set up by C&O, three, data on 
number of shifts to be equipped, four, training

00:21.176 --> 00:34.375
school manuals, land lease directives, and so on. 
The stock maintenance section was also organized

00:34.726 --> 00:41.218
to handle items common to all of these sections, 
insulators, cables, headphones, and switches.

00:42.140 --> 00:46.748
In the fall of 1944, an audit group was set up, 
proposed by a number of officers from business

00:42.140 --> 00:46.748
fields. This group reviewed controls, accurate 
requirements, and so forth, and it all instituted

00:46.768 --> 00:58.810
119 cancellations of equipment worth a total of 
$70 million between December 1944 and March 1945.

00:59.600 --> 01:05.727
In October 1944, Unified Requirements 
Determining Procedure was set up to eliminate

00:59.600 --> 01:05.727
duplicate requirements and guesswork. Under 
this Procedure, one requirements card was

01:05.747 --> 01:13.897
established for each type of equipment or each 
item to be procured by the Radio Division.

01:13.917 --> 01:18.182
The system of allowance of battle damage 
continues to occasion unbalanced production.

01:19.103 --> 01:21.726
However, the use of flat percentage was not 
abolished immediately. For example, it was used

01:21.746 --> 01:29.455
exclusively for sonar up to 1945, but it was still 
used in May 1945 for new types of equipment for

01:21.746 --> 01:29.455
which no experience existed. Page 281,

01:31.122 --> 01:36.170
this is. Page 283. Bureau

01:36.911 --> 01:47.127
of Ships, Electronics Design Division, procured 
electronics equipment for itself and the Bureau

01:36.911 --> 01:47.127
of Aeronautics, as well as the Marine Corps and the 
Maritime Commission of the Vietnamese. Procured

01:48.329 --> 01:54.538
for these agencies in line with the Navy policy of 
centering all procurement of the largest use of

01:48.329 --> 01:54.538
the given type. I'm not going to discuss the 
details. Page 284, the Bureau of Ships prepared

01:56.452 --> 02:08.573
detailed specifications in consultation with 
the Bureau of Aeronautics, negotiated the price,

01:56.452 --> 02:08.573
directed production effort, and approved all 
commitments affecting design and production.

02:08.593 --> 02:14.803
The Bureau of Ships also initiated the design and 
development of new electronics equipment, the

02:08.593 --> 02:14.803
Bureau of Aeronautics paying the direct cost. And 
it says that if the business did not procure from

02:14.823 --> 02:20.653
the Bureau of Autonomous, it would have provided 
that Bureau with technical advice. Altogether,

02:22.102 --> 02:27.089
however, the division procured about 
nine-tenths of the Navy's electronics

02:22.102 --> 02:27.089
requirements. This system gave one bureau an 
overall view of the situation with respect to

02:27.109 --> 02:34.701
production, price, component, and labor, while 
eliminating duplication of many functions. The

02:35.462 --> 02:39.367
disadvantage was the delay in processing 
procurements through several technical

02:35.462 --> 02:39.367
bureaus. Inseparate authority and 
responsibility in continually obscuring the

02:40.149 --> 02:44.575
status of procurement in the two bureaus. 
Practice, however, of having Burea designate the

02:44.595 --> 02:51.265
contract to reduce defectiveness of provided 
procurement for the chief advantage of having

02:44.595 --> 02:51.265
bureauships handle Burea procurements. or that 
the former could then consider from an overall

02:51.818 --> 03:00.626
point of view factors such as keeping contractors 
in business, comparative pricing, labor

02:51.818 --> 03:00.626
situation, and so forth. Theoretically, the 
function of selecting the contractor,

03:00.646 --> 03:10.815
negotiating price, and awarding the contract 
belonged to Buce Santa, which before the war

03:00.646 --> 03:10.815
performed this function for the use of 
procurement other than electronics. Though

03:10.835 --> 03:21.724
electronics have the technical complexity and 
rapid technical development, the huge

03:10.835 --> 03:21.724
acceleration of procurements placed a job beyond 
the technical competence of the Bureau of

03:10.835 --> 03:21.724
Suppliers and Accounts. Authorities for 
initiating procurement requests in the

03:23.375 --> 03:36.693
electronics division came from CNO 1, either in 
correspondence setting up ship or shore

03:23.375 --> 03:36.693
allowances and requesting specific equipment, 
or 2, in requests for equipment for claimant ships

03:23.375 --> 03:36.693
and so forth, resulting from CNO directives. 
Before July 44, procurement requests were

03:37.334 --> 03:42.261
prepared by specialist sections of the 
installation and maintenance branch.

03:42.501 --> 03:47.087
Procurement requests after that were prepared by 
the cognizant equipment section, radar, and so

03:42.501 --> 03:47.087
forth.

03:52.214 --> 04:03.995
It's interesting, on page 288, the lack of pricing 
experience, the need for speed, the problem for

03:52.214 --> 04:03.995
rapid changes, and specifications were dealt 
with by using acceptance of the negotiations up to

03:52.214 --> 04:03.995
July 1944. Either letters of intent or contracts 
specifying maximum price with later

04:04.556 --> 04:13.050
redetermination down but only. The letter of 
intent described all known specifications in the

04:13.070 --> 04:17.378
name of ceiling price and so forth. In July 1944, 
there were nearly 500 letters of intent

04:18.320 --> 04:25.390
outstanding to the value of nearly a billion 
dollars and 300 maximum price contracts.

04:26.692 --> 04:33.782
Parenthetically, I don't believe this applied to 
RMD, but on page 289 it says, cost plus fixed fee

04:26.692 --> 04:33.782
contracts were rarely used. Manufacturers 
opposed them, and the Navy cost inspection

04:33.903 --> 04:37.788
service was not large enough. This is King Cooper 
speaking. I think that they did use cost plus fixed

04:39.731 --> 04:44.538
fee on some of the receipts. Another interesting 
comment on 290. The dearth of firms with

04:48.239 --> 04:56.029
experience in facilities made it necessary 
during 1942 and 43 to rely almost entirely on the

04:48.239 --> 04:56.029
very large firms. Thus, the production report 
lists only 44 prime contractors in November 1942,

04:56.049 --> 05:08.344
and the largest 14 firms of which held 92% of the 
dollar volume. On page 311, after describing how

05:08.364 --> 05:16.795
they had to change from sending equipment to a 
specific ship, which might be some equipment that

05:08.364 --> 05:16.795
stayed long time in storage, On 3-11, the 
bombardment continues. It was decided,

05:19.837 --> 05:26.807
therefore, to create so-called pools of 
electronic apparatus in all naval districts

05:19.837 --> 05:26.807
requiring radio, radar, and sonar materials. 
These pools were set up in early 1943, 1942 for

05:26.827 --> 05:34.779
radar, under cognizance of the radio material 
officer by the industrial manager. Materials

05:35.961 --> 05:39.947
were shipped to the pools under requirements set 
up by the RMO. The material was not marked for

05:41.125 --> 05:45.949
specific vessels except in special cases. The RMO 
was to allocate the stocks according to his own

05:45.969 --> 05:52.936
judgment, keeping in mind the need for balance in 
new construction and maintenance needs. The

05:52.956 --> 06:01.864
placing in pools and Navy yards and Navy supply 
depots made the electronic equipment available

05:52.956 --> 06:01.864
for the first ship arriving on the period, which 
added precedence high enough to claim that. For

06:02.345 --> 06:04.887
example, a DD would have precedence over a YP. On 
the other hand, this system had the defect that

06:04.907 --> 06:09.411
each claimant regarded the entire pool as his own, 
For example, the Naval Supply Depot at

06:10.505 --> 06:16.591
Mechanicsburg had large stocks of TCS's placed 
there for various claimants. Section 6 claimants

06:16.611 --> 06:19.734
shipped against it and the stock ran out quickly. 
This kind of situation was met in the summer of 1943

06:19.754 --> 06:31.985
by C&O setting up precedence categories in place 
of the pool system for equipment for various

06:19.754 --> 06:31.985
classes of ships and for various other uses, 
Marine Corps, amphibious, advanced base, and so

06:19.754 --> 06:31.985
forth. The pool was divided into four categories, 
new construction controlled by Bureau of Ships,

06:32.585 --> 06:38.571
maintenance ships controlled by Forces of the 
Flood, Shore station is controlled by Bureau of

06:39.007 --> 06:41.130
Ships. Advanced base is controlled by SIGPAC and 
SIGPAC jointly. Later, the fifth category was set

06:44.514 --> 06:48.118
up consisting of material removed from shipment 
stations. This category was given to the Bureau of

06:48.178 --> 06:51.682
Ships for reassignment in category 1 to 4. In order 
to apply this category system, the radio division

06:52.663 --> 07:03.737
thereupon organized the assignment section, 
which uses CNO directors as a guide in assigning

06:52.663 --> 07:03.737
the total estimated production of each type of the 
various claimant sections. I'm trying here to get

07:05.278 --> 07:08.322
the information that set up Tommy Austin, Tommy 
Rogers, under which I worked at Pearl. Page 313,

07:13.332 --> 07:23.863
the establishment of the pool system also made it 
necessary, at least desirable, to assign a

07:13.332 --> 07:23.863
special personnel to the yards with the technical 
knowledge to receive, issue, and store

07:13.332 --> 07:23.863
electronics apparatus. In almost complexity of 
electronics apparatus and parts, there were

07:24.684 --> 07:37.397
5,000 types of capacitor, an equal number of 
resistor types, and 2,000 glasses of vacuum

07:24.684 --> 07:37.397
tubes, made it impossible for ordinary naval 
storekeepers and suppliers to handle radio

07:24.684 --> 07:37.397
equipment. The supply officer for radio was 
accordingly set up to help the radio material

07:37.934 --> 07:53.569
officer, RMO, with the technical aspects of 
installation

07:37.934 --> 07:53.569
and maintenance. Page 314. The principal pools 
were located along the central and west coast of

07:54.109 --> 08:02.257
the Navy Yard and other Navy establishments where 
material could be located or installed aboard

07:54.109 --> 08:02.257
vessels. In addition, radio pools were located at 
principal and advanced bases such as Pearl Harbor

08:02.277 --> 08:07.722
and the Nile Zone and Guam. Several factors had 
complicated the problem of establishing

08:08.967 --> 08:13.496
completely adequate pools. There had always been 
shortages of certain special types of critical

08:13.557 --> 08:24.179
materials, and this shortage was accentuated by 
the rapid technical development that made types

08:13.557 --> 08:24.179
obsolete often before the time they were 
produced. In addition, the fleet and the standard

08:24.199 --> 08:26.824
of war moved frequently and rapidly. By the time 
bases like Nubia and New Guinea had been built, a

08:27.260 --> 08:32.869
fleet operation had descended 1,000 miles north. 
A major movement from east to west coast of

08:32.889 --> 08:41.783
continental pools was called for by the collapse 
of Germany and the concentration of the war in the

08:32.889 --> 08:41.783
Pacific.

08:44.628 --> 08:44.708
315. Difficulties with actually getting, 
installing, and maintaining equipment was

08:44.728 --> 08:48.815
enormous. Page 320. Approximately 3,000 
Approximately 3,000 naval vessels of all types

08:53.078 --> 09:07.572
and sizes were completely equipped with delicate 
and expensive radio communication equipment

08:53.078 --> 09:07.572
during the last year of the war.

09:07.592 --> 09:19.923
Thinking of Red Bacon and the other engineers, the 
story of the field engineering services and the

09:07.592 --> 09:19.923
installation and maintenance branch for the 
period of June 40 to June 1945 was the story of

09:07.592 --> 09:19.923
expansion and extension to meet the needs of the 
Navy. In June of 1940, there was no field

09:19.943 --> 09:22.866
engineering service. In October 1941, the first 
field engineering service contract was led. It

09:29.156 --> 09:34.464
proved so successful that contracts had been led 
to cover most electronic equipment. By June 1945,

09:34.484 --> 09:40.532
there were approximately 1,000 factory field 
engineers, and it totaled a cost of over $1 million

09:34.484 --> 09:40.532
per month. The anti-submarine warfare engineers 
reached a zenith of 65 engineers in November 1944.

09:47.362 --> 09:52.870
This group tapered off toward elimination on 1 
June 1945, its function being taken over by the

09:47.362 --> 09:52.870
Navy. The Electronic Fuel Services Group 
consisted of 250 engineers in August 1945.

10:01.083 --> 10:05.087
This is an indication of how the printing went up. 
In 1940, there was one periodical, the Radio and

10:05.107 --> 10:09.171
Sound Bulletin, issued from the radio division. 
By 1945, the publication section issued seven

10:09.191 --> 10:20.342
periodicals, published 50 books, and each month 
approved 64 equipment instruction books and

10:09.191 --> 10:20.342
supervised distribution of 80,000 copies.

10:24.237 --> 10:33.450
On page 327 is a chart of such radio program, chart 
24, 29, which is dramatic in its growth. That ends

10:34.591 --> 10:40.980
this particular description, Bureau of Ships 
World War II, volume 4. And we go into Crossroads,

10:42.282 --> 10:46.988
beginning on page 329. Less than a year after the 
devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the eyes

10:48.115 --> 11:01.589
and ears of the world turned toward a little atoll 
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to discover just

10:48.115 --> 11:01.589
how cataclysmic this explosion of splitting 
atoms could be. While the results of the two atomic

11:03.351 --> 11:12.621
bomb tests conducted at the Bikini Atoll on 1 July 
and 25 July 1946 are still not firmly Fully

11:12.922 --> 11:26.621
determined, while much of the information 
remains of a classified nature, it is possible to

11:12.922 --> 11:26.621
discuss in general terms this operation's 
crossroads in which the Bureau of Ships played

11:12.922 --> 11:26.621
such an important

11:12.922 --> 11:26.621
role. Detail account of this incredible 
operation, which is contained in Joint Task Force

11:26.681 --> 11:34.893
One. I'll repeat that. Since the historical 
report, Atomic Bomb Timothy,

11:42.402 --> 11:52.295
Abel and Baker Operations Crossroads of Director 
of Ship Material, Joint Task Force One, contains a

11:42.402 --> 11:52.295
complete detailed account of this incredible 
operation. This study will confine itself to

11:52.335 --> 12:04.030
unclassified excerpts of that report and to 
general comments which may serve to unify the

11:52.335 --> 12:04.030
parts.

12:04.210 --> 12:04.410
On 331, On 20 June 1945, when the European War was 
ended and the Pacific War was approaching its

12:06.061 --> 12:20.998
climactic phase, Vice Admiral E.L. Cochrane, 
Chief of the Bureau of Ships and Vice Admiral, then

12:06.061 --> 12:20.998
Rear Admiral G.F. Hussey, Chief of the Bureau of 
Ordnance, addressed a joint letter to the Chief of

12:21.333 --> 12:36.019
Naval Operations proposing a comprehensive 
program for testing high explosives against

12:21.333 --> 12:36.019
merchant and warship hawks, captured enemy 
vessels and United States Navy combatant ships

12:21.333 --> 12:36.019
about to be stricken from the active list. It was 
decided to go beyond the model studies and

12:36.319 --> 12:44.033
full-scale caisson tests, which were normally 
carried out by the two bureaus. This proposal for,

12:44.570 --> 12:56.568
quote, controlled destructive testing and a 
planned program to elicit fundamental

12:44.570 --> 12:56.568
information on damage to ship-like structures by 
high explosives, end quote, met with approval.

12:57.209 --> 13:03.699
The two bureaus and their research agencies sped 
up the planning, which has already been done to

12:57.209 --> 13:03.699
carry out this program. Meanwhile, other forces 
were at work. In the New Mexico desert near

13:07.233 --> 13:31.823
Almagordo on 16 July 1945, scientists of the 
Manhattan District secretly carried out the

13:07.233 --> 13:31.823
Trinity Test with the first explosion of the 
atomic bomb, which has been under civilian and

13:07.233 --> 13:31.823
military development since July of 1939, when 
Einstein and other scientists brought the

13:07.233 --> 13:31.823
military potentialities of such a weapon to the 
attention of President Roosevelt. On 5 August,

13:31.803 --> 13:38.239
only three weeks after this test, the first 
military atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima.

13:38.259 --> 13:44.174
And a few days later, another atomic bomb exploded 
over Nagasaki, hastening the Pacific War to its

13:38.259 --> 13:44.174
close. The Japanese, faced with this new terror as 
well as imminent, invasion surrendered

13:47.699 --> 13:54.010
unconditionally on 14 August, nine days after the 
first atomic bomb had been dropped. Even before

13:54.951 --> 14:07.513
technical personnel made their studies in Japan, 
reports of damage at Hiroshima and Nagasaki

13:54.951 --> 14:07.513
offered conclusive proof, if any were needed, of 
the tremendous military potentialities of this

13:54.951 --> 14:07.513
new weapon.

14:10.058 --> 14:24.955
On 28 August, the Chief of Bureau of Ships, Vice 
Admiral Cochrane, informed his design and

14:10.058 --> 14:24.955
research agencies, which were planning new 
programs of underwater explosion work with

14:10.058 --> 14:24.955
conventional explosives, that the Bureau of 
Ships, quote, must be prepared to undertake

14:10.058 --> 14:24.955
broad-scale experiments with the atomic bomb. On 
1 October, Vice Admiral Cochrane and Vice Admiral

14:26.697 --> 14:39.171
Hussey sent another letter to the Chief of Naval 
Operations stating that the repairments of the

14:26.697 --> 14:39.171
atomic bomb had made it imperative that a program 
of full-scale testing be undertaken. to

14:39.725 --> 14:44.735
determine the effects of this type of bomb, both 
underwater, above water, and against ships of

14:39.725 --> 14:44.735
various types. This is on page 332.

14:49.404 --> 14:55.797
It continued that the two bureaus would prepare 
and present for consideration of the earliest

14:49.404 --> 14:55.797
practical data testing program.

14:58.762 --> 14:59.083
In a letter, On 16 October, Admiral E.J. King, 
Commander-in-Chief of the United States Fleet

15:02.155 --> 15:12.400
and the Chief of Naval Operations, recommended 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff approve a test of the

15:02.155 --> 15:12.400
atomic bomb against naval vessels. The Joint 
Chiefs of Staff undertook the study of this

15:13.483 --> 15:16.330
proposal. The Bureau of Ships was represented on 
this subcommittee of planners, a joint staff

15:17.862 --> 15:29.715
planners were appointed, and a planning 
subcommittee under the chairmanship of Major

15:17.862 --> 15:29.715
General Curtis LeMay, Army Air Force. The Bureau 
of Ships was represented on this subcommittee by

15:30.976 --> 15:37.504
Captain Alec Niskan, K-N-I-S-K-E-R, and head of 
the design branch. The Secretaries of War and of

15:39.966 --> 15:47.835
the Navy made the first public announcement of the 
proposed test, and a joint press release on 10

15:39.966 --> 15:47.835
December is on page 333. stating that the Army and 
Navy contemplated a, quote, joint test of atomic

15:48.608 --> 15:54.197
bombs against naval vessels, end quote. On 10 
January 1946, the President approved the

15:55.059 --> 16:00.508
recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And 
on 11 January, the Joint Chiefs of Staff created

16:00.528 --> 16:06.699
Joint Task Force One, appointing Vice Admiral 
W.H.P. Blandy, the Deputy Chief of Naval

16:06.739 --> 16:11.106
Operations for Special Weapons, as his 
commander. Admiral Blanding had already begun

16:11.862 --> 16:19.934
specific planning for the two tests, starting 
with consideration of various proposals for

16:11.862 --> 16:19.934
target arrays drawn up by the Bureau of Ships. Page 
334. The mission of Joint Task Force One was

16:22.338 --> 16:39.844
publicly announced by its commander on 24 
January, when Vice Admiral Blanding told the

16:22.338 --> 16:39.844
Senate Committee of Atomic Energy, the mission of 
Joint Task Force One is primarily to determine the

16:22.338 --> 16:39.844
effects of the atomic bomb upon naval vessels in 
order to gain information of value to the national

16:22.338 --> 16:39.844
defense.

16:42.963 --> 16:49.752
The ultimate results of the test, so far as the Navy 
is concerned, will be their translations into

16:42.963 --> 16:49.752
terms of United States sea power. Secondary 
purposes are to afford training of the Army Air

16:49.772 --> 17:02.170
Force's personnel in attack with the atomic bomb 
against ships and to determine the effect of the

16:49.772 --> 17:02.170
atomic bomb upon military installations and 
equipment." He also announced that the atomic

17:03.251 --> 17:09.780
bomb tests had been assigned the code name 
Operation Crossroads. Now on page 335, some

17:11.397 --> 17:18.909
exploratory discussions and organizations were 
set up.

17:24.437 --> 17:32.950
As the Bureau of Ships had a permanent interest in 
Operation Crossroads, Admiral Cochrane

17:24.437 --> 17:32.950
recognized his great responsibility, which were 
devolved upon the officers elected to represent

17:24.437 --> 17:32.950
the Bureau. Accordingly, he decided to appoint 
Rear Admiral T.A. Sahlberg, head of the research

17:36.189 --> 17:43.121
branch of the Bureau of Ships, as a senior member of 
a large bureau group for Operation Crossroads.

17:44.102 --> 17:55.302
Admiral Sahlberg had been a deputy member of the 
Tolman Committee appointed by Major General

17:44.102 --> 17:55.302
Leslie R. Groves in the fall of 1944, almost a year 
before the Trinity test, and so forth. This

17:55.322 --> 17:58.988
committee under the chairmanship of Tolman had 
studied many suggestions. On 17 January, Admiral

18:00.132 --> 18:08.721
Cochrane appointed Admiral Solberg to this 
position because it was desirable to have someone

18:00.132 --> 18:08.721
in his rank and experience coordinate all the 
varied ones.

18:13.126 --> 18:22.917
An order dated 22 January set up Code 180, the 
Crossroads Section, and on the same day, Admiral

18:13.126 --> 18:22.917
Solberg was designated as head of the section and 
Captain Niskanen as his senior assistant.

18:24.331 --> 18:29.057
Meanwhile, Admiral Sahlberg and Captain Niskan 
consulted with Rear Admiral then Commodore W.S.

18:29.157 --> 18:33.642
Parsons as to the relationship of Admiral 
Sahlberg's group to the rest of the task force. In

18:34.363 --> 18:53.106
the first organization chart prepared by the task 
force, Admiral Parsons was shown as Deputy Task

18:34.363 --> 18:53.106
Force Commander for Technical Direction, and 
under him was the Technical Director, Dr. R.A.

18:34.363 --> 18:53.106
Sawyer, S-A-W-Y-E-R, in charge of scientific 
aspects of the tests, particularly the

18:34.363 --> 18:53.106
preparation of the bombs and instrumentation to 
measure their effects. and so on, and Admiral

18:55.347 --> 19:03.076
Sahlberg received this overall technical 
responsibility as, quote, director of ship

18:55.347 --> 19:03.076
material assigned under Admiral Parsons.

19:05.759 --> 19:24.021
It was agreed that all instrumentation would be 
subject to the technical director's approval,

19:05.759 --> 19:24.021
that's Dr. Sawyer, but that the director of ship 
material, this is Admiral Sahlberg, would have a

19:05.759 --> 19:24.021
major interest in problems involved in locations 
of instruments on target ships and in their

19:05.759 --> 19:24.021
installation as well as the results they gave with 
reference to ship damage. It was therefore agreed

19:26.032 --> 19:31.220
that the closest liaison between the technical 
director and the director of ship material would

19:26.032 --> 19:31.220
be necessary. It goes on to further describe the 
organization. The heavy involvement of the

19:37.891 --> 19:51.392
Bureau of Ships, which went beyond the target 
ships themselves to include special interests in

19:37.891 --> 19:51.392
electronics, oceanography, ship's 
instrumentation, and explosion phenomena, made

19:37.891 --> 19:51.392
the task of the director of ship material diverse 
and complex. On the one hand, Admiral Solberg was

19:52.587 --> 20:06.282
responsible for all the Bureau of Ships' 
activities and operations crossroads,

19:52.587 --> 20:06.282
including special projects like oceanographic 
instrumentation, which was to be provided for the

19:52.587 --> 20:06.282
most part in the water rather than on the target 
ships themselves. On the other hand, he was

20:07.143 --> 20:17.194
responsible for all target ships, as well as for 
all materials and installations on those ships,

20:07.143 --> 20:17.194
and for close liaison with the technical director 
on all instrumentation problems affecting the

20:07.143 --> 20:17.194
target ships.

20:20.397 --> 20:31.351
Of interest, opposite page 338 is chart 30, 
showing the director of ship material, 014, with

20:20.397 --> 20:31.351
Admiral Sauberius, 014. Of interest are the 
oceanography group, which is under Dr. Sawyer,

20:32.473 --> 20:48.514
013, the oceanography group, 013B, and the ship's 
instrumentation group, 013C, and the

20:32.473 --> 20:48.514
electronics group, 013D.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.503
quite an interesting chart. The Bureau of Ships 
Group was quite an important group. The first

21:01.068 --> 21:12.499
concern was that whole machinery and electrical 
gear of almost 90 target ships plus reserve ships

21:01.068 --> 21:12.499
ranging from landing craft to carriers and 
battleships be placed in proper material

21:01.068 --> 21:12.499
condition. It goes on to talk about 
indoctrination of crews, electrical power, and

21:12.519 --> 21:19.345
so forth, and says the 139 target must be equipped 
not only to transport personnel and supplies, but

21:20.725 --> 21:34.521
to provide laboratory space for scientific 
groups in the study of oceanographic,

21:20.725 --> 21:34.521
radiological, and other phenomena, and to 
provide facilities for press and radio, as well as

21:20.725 --> 21:34.521
manned surveillance and observers. That's on 
page 344. Then after describing the preparation

21:37.564 --> 21:45.433
of the target ships, on page 349, is a list of the 
actual target vessels, which included the

21:45.717 --> 22:06.378
Arkansas, the Pennsylvania, the Salt Lake City, 
the two jet vessels, Nagato, Sakawa, and the

21:45.717 --> 22:06.378
German Prinz Eugen, the dear old Saratago, and the 
Independence, the famous old Lampson destroyer,

21:45.717 --> 22:06.378
the Skipjack, the Sea Raven, the Tuna, and the 
Skate. Many, many well-known wartime two ships.

22:14.006 --> 22:14.627
Stop. Page 354 gives a full page from A through Y of a 
check-off list of what had to be done to prepare one

22:15.637 --> 22:25.611
of the target ships. On page 355, the preparation 
of the 139 target vessels assigned to the task

22:25.952 --> 22:34.624
force required conversion or modification 
necessary to provide adequate accommodations

22:35.532 --> 22:39.899
for more than the normal complement of most of 
these ships. Office space and equipment were

22:40.060 --> 22:48.774
essential for the administration work to be 
carried on, and various technical groups

22:40.060 --> 22:48.774
required laboratories and other scientific 
facilities. Most of the work in conveying these

22:49.536 --> 22:54.705
vessels offered no difficulty, apart from the 
fact that very little time was available.

22:55.626 --> 23:00.274
Additional communication facilities required 
for operations and public relations were

22:55.626 --> 23:00.274
provided. after showing how the organization 
went on to teams to enter the harbor after the thing

23:00.575 --> 23:23.798
for inspection now the after the fact on 360 it says 
on 15 16 june the directorship material had

23:00.575 --> 23:23.798
rehearsals for initial boarding teams which were 
realistic in every detail the army air forces had

23:00.575 --> 23:23.798
also been conducting independent drill with 
bombing runs on nevada On 24 June, Queen Day, a

23:24.622 --> 23:38.523
full-dress rehearsal was held on the exact 
conditions of the actual Crossroads operations,

23:24.622 --> 23:38.523
except that a 500-pound phosphorus bomb, a 
fragmentation bomb, was substituted for the

23:24.622 --> 23:38.523
eagerly-awaited atomic bomb. Weather forecasts 
on 30 June indicated that the day selected for Able

23:40.005 --> 23:45.494
Day, the 1 July, would be satisfactory. And at 9 
o'clock on the morning of 30 June, the signal was

23:46.435 --> 23:52.384
sent from Mount McKinley designating the 
following day as Able Day. and setting in motion

23:52.803 --> 23:55.106
the evacuation plan.

24:02.174 --> 24:08.062
All vessels proceeded out of their sectors and 
quarters for steam through the night, waiting

24:02.174 --> 24:08.062
able to eat. On 1 July 1946, the first atomic bomb of 
Operation Crossroads burst.

24:16.232 --> 24:21.358
The operations in the McKinney area were 
concluded on 25 August The Bureau of Ships group

24:22.520 --> 24:33.232
arrived in San Francisco on 7 September, 
reassembled in Washington, and officers

24:22.520 --> 24:33.232
provided by the Bureau of Ships on 23 September to 
undertake preparation of final reports. That's

24:33.252 --> 24:34.593
page 362.

24:37.356 --> 24:42.282
On page 364, the formation of the electronics 
group is described in detail. On their important

24:42.482 --> 24:50.451
jobs were the establishment of telemetering of 
soldiers

24:42.482 --> 24:50.451
and measuring the time pressurization of air 
blasts, and I won't go into that, except they did

24:50.768 --> 24:59.660
have to telemeter a lot of stuff. The interest of 
oceanographers is that on page 369, early in

24:59.680 --> 25:12.777
February after the oceanography group had 
requested the use of television for measuring

24:59.680 --> 25:12.777
wave heights, the electronics group organized a 
television project. The initial project was

25:13.415 --> 25:21.646
intended for remote observation of wave 
formations only, with receiving equipment

25:13.415 --> 25:21.646
installed on an aircraft and the image recorded by 
motion pictures. When this project was well

25:21.666 --> 25:29.377
underway, it became evident that the television 
cameras also would provide a means of preserving

25:21.666 --> 25:29.377
its other remote stations in the general area of 
the explosion. Accordingly, another project was

25:30.178 --> 25:31.880
set up. For wave measurement, two television 
cameras and transmitters were installed on

25:32.581 --> 25:37.448
Bikini Island on towers. The wave height was 
indicated on two calibrated poles set up in the

25:38.896 --> 25:43.743
water in the field of the television cameras. The 
television equipment was standard naval design.

25:48.690 --> 25:59.746
It required direct line of sight, so they made this 
condition possible by installing television

25:48.690 --> 25:59.746
receivers on two PBM-5 seaplanes, which also 
carried automatic recording 35mm cameras. This

25:59.786 --> 26:07.857
way it was possible to obtain a photographic 
record of the wave heights on the calibrated poles

25:59.786 --> 26:07.857
pictured in the field of the television cameras. 
They also used sonobuoys and phallometers, two

26:09.254 --> 26:18.968
sonobuoys operating on suitable frequencies, 
were installed in Bikini Lagoon for the use of the

26:09.254 --> 26:18.968
oceanography group and its wave measurements. 
Twenty-five portable phallometers were

26:19.729 --> 26:26.379
provided in the same program, some of them being 
mounted in the lagoon on buoys, the others on

26:19.729 --> 26:26.379
target ships. Provisions were made for auxiliary 
power for the phallometers normally carried on

26:27.140 --> 26:33.549
target vessels so that these could be used by the 
oceanography group. Timing signals were

26:34.671 --> 26:37.675
described on page 371. Navigational radar 
readings, telemetering of Geiger counters.

26:43.287 --> 26:46.250
There was a drone program. Test operations.

26:51.335 --> 26:58.602
Instrumentation was a mutual thing, apparently, 
with all the different organizations of the

26:51.335 --> 26:58.602
Bureau of Ships Instrumentation Group. Option 
page 378 is a chart of the Oceanography Group 013.

27:05.380 --> 27:07.503

LaValle. The Oceanography Survey Section under

27:11.708 --> 27:15.834
Lieutenant Commander C.A. Barnes. Wave 
Measurement Section, Lieutenant Commander F.G.

27:17.656 --> 27:20.720
Morris.

27:24.325 --> 27:25.927
Many, many familiar names.

27:30.313 --> 27:30.773
380. Oceanography Group Formation. On 13 
December 1945, the Deputy Chief of Naval

27:34.135 --> 27:47.253
Operations for Special Weapons conferred with 
representatives of the Manhattan District, the

27:34.135 --> 27:47.253
Hydrographic Office, and the Bureau of Ships 
relative to surface water waves generated by

27:34.135 --> 27:47.253
atomic explosions. In this conference, the 
oceanographic facilities of the Bureau of Ships

27:47.313 --> 27:54.243
and the Hydrographic Office were described for 
representatives of the Manhattan District. The

27:54.783 --> 28:01.813
group discussed ocean currents as they affected 
the choice of a safe test site. and Bureau of Ships

28:02.131 --> 28:07.219
Personnel outlined their program of wave studies 
and instrumentation. The Oceanography Group is a

28:07.239 --> 28:18.617
formal participant in Operation Crossroads with 
the Bureau of Ships Commander Revell as head,

28:07.239 --> 28:18.617
organized into two main sections dealing with 
oceanographic surveys and wave measurements.

28:18.637 --> 28:26.670
The first of these included four subsections for 
radiological safety reconnaissance, physical

28:18.637 --> 28:26.670
oceanography, biology, and geology. and 
fisheries. The wave measurement section

28:28.194 --> 28:32.503
included two subsections dealing with wave 
motion and seismology. Specialty design was

28:33.244 --> 28:36.190
maintained with other instrumentation groups. 
Civilian personnel were drawn from many public

28:36.330 --> 28:43.464
and private scientific agencies to assist in 
planning and carrying out the technical work of

28:36.330 --> 28:43.464
the group. Motionographic survey. Following the 
exploratory discussions, the oceanography

28:46.580 --> 28:57.178
group began active work not only in the technical 
problems of wave measurement, but also in the

28:46.580 --> 28:57.178
field of physical oceanography, biology, 
geology, and fisheries. Every effort was made to

28:57.198 --> 29:01.686
ensure that all cognizant government and 
civilian agencies were represented. and that no

29:01.936 --> 29:04.259
proper interests were neglected. Based to the 
investigations in all four fields was the

29:04.579 --> 29:21.721
decision to have Ballitz, that's the ship, make a 
survey of the physical oceanography of Bikini

29:04.579 --> 29:21.721
Atoll, for Ballitz eventually became the home for 
a large number of scientists engaged in a

29:04.579 --> 29:21.721
full-fledged scientific expedition, which was 
an essential preliminary to the tests

29:04.579 --> 29:21.721
themselves. The planning of the Ballitz 
expedition was a major task involving many

29:22.201 --> 29:27.488
different civilian scientific agencies. A 
fiscal oceanographic survey was made to

29:28.261 --> 29:40.114
establish the current regime and related 
oceanographic conditions in Bikini Atoll and

29:28.261 --> 29:40.114
surrounding waters, which would influence the 
scattering and diffusion of radioactive

29:28.261 --> 29:40.114
substances resulting from the bursts. 
Commercial interests in the Pacific were

29:41.055 --> 29:49.864
disturbed when the proposed test first appeared 
in the newspapers over the possibility of

29:41.055 --> 29:49.864
far-reaching harmful effects upon the 
commercial fish supply. This is on page 381.

29:52.561 --> 30:08.099
Accordingly, on 21 November 1945, the Secretary 
of the Interior pointed out these dangers to the

29:52.561 --> 30:08.099
Secretary of the Navy and rendered the technical 
advice of the Fisheries and Wildlife Service in

29:52.561 --> 30:08.099
the selection of a site where these dangers would 
be least. Experiments and observations were made

30:08.119 --> 30:21.775
to determine the effects of the bomb burst above 
and at the surface of the reef and lagoon fishes of

30:08.119 --> 30:21.775
Bikini Atoll and on the flood, phlogic, and 
migratory fishes, particularly tunas, in the

30:22.058 --> 30:23.460
surrounding ocean waters. The government 
agencies which supplied personnel and equipment

30:24.781 --> 30:42.522
pointed out the opportunity in Operation 
Crossroads to acquire fundamental scientific

30:24.781 --> 30:42.522
knowledge in many fields, including the effects 
of concussion, wave action, the radiant effects

30:24.781 --> 30:42.522
of heat, light, and radioactivity upon aquatic 
organisms. They plan to measure... Now turn over

30:42.542 --> 30:45.946
the tape to side four. Turn over this tape to side 
four and continue. The discretion of...
