00:04.452 --> 00:15.924
This is an interview with Mr. Aubrey Grice by 
Stuart Dunn on April 16, 1989 at the home of Mr.

00:04.452 --> 00:15.924
Grice concerning the dropping of the bomb on 
Hiroshima. In the interest of accumulating

00:15.944 --> 00:23.852
knowledge about the war, I'm going to donate this 
tape to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in

00:15.944 --> 00:23.852
the University Archives. Mr. Grice, is this okay 
with you? Yes. Thank you. Mr. Grice, when were you

00:29.078 --> 00:30.199
born? December 13, 1923. That's not that long ago. 
65 years. What was your educational background?

00:42.422 --> 00:47.570
Well, in the beginning, I grew up on a farm in East 
Texas. I went to a little two-room schoolhouse

00:49.714 --> 00:56.425
through the eighth grade.

00:56.445 --> 01:02.134
Then I rode a school bus into a little town in 
Winsboro, about eight miles away. and completed

01:03.093 --> 01:08.481
high school there, graduated in 1940, just after I 
turned 16. So we had 11 grades then instead of 12.

01:14.651 --> 01:29.674
And then for the next few years I worked in Dallas 
and got my father on the farm until World War II came

01:14.651 --> 01:29.674
along, and then I started some of my other 
education during and after that. Was it a college

01:29.924 --> 01:32.147
education? Yeah, after the war. I got out in 1946 
and went to Southern Methodist University here in

01:33.108 --> 01:43.743
Dallas, and was graduated in August 1948. Okay.

01:50.092 --> 01:53.276
Brother Grice, when did you get into the service? 
In April 1943. April of 1943. And why did you join

01:59.793 --> 02:01.556
the service? Well, you know, the Japanese had 
attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, and everybody

02:02.437 --> 02:28.095
was going in that time, and I would have been 
drafted, I was, in 1943, I was 19,

02:02.437 --> 02:28.095
and I was at the age, they had just, when they first 
started drafting people into the war, they was 21.

02:29.172 --> 02:36.801
And then after a while, or a little bit after Pearl 
Harbor, I think there, I can't remember the exact

02:29.172 --> 02:36.801
time, but they lowered it to 18. And so I knew that I 
was going to be drafted and have to go into service,

02:37.241 --> 02:44.710
and I always wanted to fly. Little guy down on the 
farm, I'd stop and watch airplanes fly over.

02:49.876 --> 02:51.618
Whatever I was doing. Yeah, and I just was 
fascinated by airplanes, and so I wanted to fly,

02:51.638 --> 02:59.027
and so I had an opportunity to volunteer to get into 
the Army Air Corps at that time. Later became the US

03:06.776 --> 03:09.019
Air Force. And so I went in and took all my 
examinations and everything and passed and got

03:09.940 --> 03:15.907
in. Super. As a cadet. That's super. How did you go 
about joining? Well, I talked to my folks and of

03:23.556 --> 03:29.183
course I was, at that time the legal age was 21. 
instead of 18. And so I had to have their

03:31.322 --> 03:32.664
permission. But I talked to them, and they said, 
well, if that's what you want to do, that's fine.

03:36.890 --> 03:38.011
You're going to have to go in anyhow. You're going 
to be drafted at some point. You may as well do what

03:40.414 --> 03:41.876
you want to do. So they were very cooperative. And I 
believe we went to Tyler about 50 miles away to a

03:44.800 --> 03:55.874
recruitment office and talked with the Air Force 
down there and my father and me. And I came back, and

03:55.934 --> 03:59.018
I took some tests. No, they sent me to Greenville, 
up to Greenville, Texas, to have a physical. And so

04:05.785 --> 04:18.220
between all the

04:05.785 --> 04:18.220
tests, both the physical tests and the health 
tests and the whole thing, I was accepted. It was

04:18.520 --> 04:20.403
really pretty simple then. What were your duties 
while you were in the service? First thing I did

04:25.053 --> 04:35.749
after I got into the service, we were sent up to 
Wichita Falls, Texas as an induction center. We

04:36.811 --> 04:42.499
were supposed to be there and have some very tough 
basic training for about 12 weeks. And after I was

04:43.661 --> 04:52.153
there about three weeks, they sent a bunch of us up 
to Stillwater, Oklahoma at that time. And that's

04:52.955 --> 04:54.537
when we really started cadets. We were enrolled in 
school there at Oklahoma State, that time

04:55.310 --> 05:03.940
Oklahoma A&M. Right. And we were there for about 
three and a half months. And mostly we were

05:09.226 --> 05:13.652
studying things like history, physics.

05:17.076 --> 05:24.945
We got to fly in little Piper Cubs for about, I think 
we had about six hours at that point. First time I

05:25.533 --> 05:27.636
had ever been in an airplane. Was in a piper club? 
Was in a piper club. How did you like that? Oh, loved

05:31.101 --> 05:31.622
it. I thought this was the greatest thing ever. 
That's one of my friends has one of those. That's

05:36.108 --> 05:36.969
great. So would you want me to kind of continue with 
through like this then? Yeah. For a while? So we

05:42.877 --> 05:44.259
were there for three and a half months. Most of that 
was studying and some basic training and some,

05:44.359 --> 05:49.186
particularly physical training. We had some, 
they had the Oklahoma A&M program. football coach

05:52.685 --> 06:00.014
squad that gave us our physical education. And by 
the time we left there, we could run a five mile

06:01.075 --> 06:10.287
cross country at a very good pace and not be panting 
very much really. We really were in good shape,

06:10.307 --> 06:12.469
tremendous shape. And then we were, after we 
completed that, we went to San Antonio to We were,

06:19.280 --> 06:25.188
for several weeks, we were just in batteries of 
tests every day. More physical education and

06:26.350 --> 06:28.653
things like that. And a few classes, films and so 
forth, to teach us about different things, but

06:30.176 --> 06:39.529
mostly just for classification purposes. And 
that's where, through tests and different

06:40.370 --> 06:47.380
things, it was determined whether you would be 
eligible for pilot school, or a navigation school

06:47.967 --> 06:52.010
or a bombardier school. So I fortunately, I was 
able to continue on with my ambition of being a

06:52.030 --> 07:01.779
pilot and completed that. And then from there we 
were transferred to Santa Ana, California, where

07:01.959 --> 07:09.205
we had what's called pre-flight. Again, more 
studies, more physical education, more

07:10.726 --> 07:17.232
drilling, Discipline. Learning a lot of 
discipline. So we went through that and then from

07:22.442 --> 07:33.616
there I went up to Merced, California for primary 
training. And we flew Stearman's. I don't know if

07:35.358 --> 07:36.659
you know what a Stearman is. I know exactly what a 
Stearman is. Bi-wing, open cockpit, two seats in

07:38.842 --> 07:43.928
each wing. That was a riot. That was more fun.

07:49.730 --> 07:54.277
have fun with it, and do everything with it. And 
everyone's ambition was, we wore helmets and

07:54.617 --> 08:02.168
goggles. You looked like World War I pilots. And 
the airplane was almost World War I vintage. But

08:07.956 --> 08:14.746
you couldn't wear a scarf until you had solo. And 
then you could wear a white scarf. And we, once we

08:19.075 --> 08:29.392
soloed, we had a, we were, we all had and wore a white 
silk scarf about eight feet long. And it would

08:30.253 --> 08:36.303
trail out to

08:30.253 --> 08:36.303
the air. It was great fun. That was just fun in that 
flying school. It was just really fun. We were

08:42.634 --> 08:45.218
really on our toes and had to be very careful. It was 
an airplane that was actually difficult to fly and

08:46.126 --> 08:51.612
that was one reason we flew it.

08:54.616 --> 09:08.412
It would

08:54.616 --> 09:08.412
wing ground very easily and flip over on it's nose 
because the top wing held the gasoline. If you were

09:09.313 --> 09:12.437
full of gas it was a little bit tight if you slammed 
on it.

09:16.045 --> 09:18.428
And if you run into problems, you were in trouble. 
They came after you. Yeah. That was funny. How did

09:23.496 --> 09:25.258
you get into the B-29? Well, it's a little bit of 
evolution. Went from there, then up to,

09:29.785 --> 09:36.855
from Santa Brea to Merced, California. Flew in 
basic training, flew a BT-13, basic trainer

09:36.936 --> 09:44.487
single engine, in that area. From that point, All 
the way through, I had requested to be a fighter

09:46.353 --> 09:50.337
pilot. Of course. If not a fighter pilot, then a 
twin-engine attack aircraft. And my last choice

09:56.663 --> 10:01.227
was to fly a four-engine bomber. When this was, I 
graduated in the class of 44G, so I graduated from

10:01.247 --> 10:12.077
cadet school in August of 1944. It was getting late 
in the war. And the war in Europe was essentially

10:16.778 --> 10:24.166
winding down. And they just basically, the 
comment was, we really don't need any more fighter

10:24.186 --> 10:31.313
pilots. We got all we need. Every person in my 
class, everyone, was sent to Twin Engine Advanced

10:34.016 --> 10:40.583
School. So we came from Merced, California to 
Pecos, Texas. to fly a twin engine advanced

10:46.225 --> 10:50.349
trainer. So we all got training in an advanced 
trainer. We pretty well knew that that would put us

10:54.374 --> 11:02.022
into a bomber of some sort. So I graduated from 
cadet school in August the 4th, 1944. And

11:06.647 --> 11:16.097
came home for the first time in 15 months. Got 
married to my high school sweetheart. The

11:23.011 --> 11:26.136
American story, it seems like. Joe Irby. And we had 
a good time. We enjoyed it. I was immediately

11:31.603 --> 11:37.952
assigned to a B-17 school in Hobbs, New Mexico. And 
we went out there, and she went with me. And by this

11:42.299 --> 11:45.443
time, of course, being an officer, we could take 
our wives. we found a place to live off base that we

11:46.368 --> 11:50.133
could afford. And so we enjoyed the three and a half 
months there. It was just great. From there we went

11:58.744 --> 12:03.811
to Lincoln, Nebraska to determine where we would 
go. Usually either a B-17 group would go someplace

12:03.831 --> 12:16.307
and form a crew and fly, a combat crew, fly with them 
a little while and get acquainted with each other

12:16.928 --> 12:19.070
and then go overseas. The war was further winding 
down by this point. About half of the group went on

12:25.456 --> 12:29.880
through into B-17s and went into Europe. Some of 
them even got overseas. The war just wound up. They

12:34.144 --> 12:38.628
had more pilots than needed and they just didn't 
remember. They selected a large group, about half

12:38.648 --> 12:44.674
of them, to go into B-29. aircraft, a new, 
relatively new aircraft at that time, flying into

12:46.088 --> 12:52.375
the Pacific. And this was kind of fun because we had 
to go through another three and a half months of

12:52.395 --> 12:56.480
training. And they sent us down to Clovis, New 
Mexico, to a big airfield down here for this

12:58.682 --> 13:04.709
training. We had been there just about a month into 
this training, and they selected three special

13:04.729 --> 13:14.560
crews or formed three special crews out of this 
entire group that they wanted to become photo

13:15.518 --> 13:34.920
reconnaissance pilots and crews to do mapping of 
Japan and the Pacific for the invasion of Japan and

13:15.518 --> 13:34.920
to do photographic work for the 20th Air Force. So I 
was selected fortunately to be among that group

13:34.940 --> 13:45.272
and we spent several months learning a lot about 
photography piloting, exactness in flying,

13:46.450 --> 14:03.392
discipline in flying, all the things that are 
necessary to really be a disciplined,

13:46.450 --> 14:03.392
good photographic crew for the 20th Air Force. So 
your main duty then was reconnaissance,

14:03.412 --> 14:12.223
I guess. Yes. What were some of your most memorable 
experiences while you were flying? Oh, if we go

14:18.825 --> 14:30.261
back to cadet area, part of it, that was a lot of fun 
in the little things. My first instructor in

14:30.541 --> 14:42.057
primary school was an older fellow who was, at that 
time he was older, he was probably in his late 30s,

14:43.201 --> 14:51.290
He had flown the Mayo in an open cockpit aircraft 
for the Army. That tells you how old he was, almost

14:52.871 --> 14:57.016
immediately after World War I. And he was a real fly 
by the seat of your pants type guy. But he was a great

15:03.403 --> 15:05.505
pilot, a really good pilot. He really taught us a 
lot. I think we were able to go through cadet school

15:13.593 --> 15:21.041
largely on the basis of what that man taught us in a 
way of discipline and just how do you fly an

15:13.593 --> 15:21.041
airplane. There's a lot of things that go with 
that. And I remember he had two cadets. He was one of

15:26.987 --> 15:28.568
the leaders. A man and a guy named Griffin, Red 
Griffin, red-headed guy from Georgia. And Bud

15:36.497 --> 15:37.678
Grice from Dallas. We were his two cadets. He came 
in one day and he said, motioned both of us to come

15:43.394 --> 15:52.765
over to the aircraft and he stood there and he 
looked at both of us and he said, you know, I want to

15:43.394 --> 15:52.765
tell you all a story. He told us a story about two 
cadets he had one time. He said one of them was real

15:56.450 --> 16:03.658
sharp but wasn't disciplined and didn't have the 
feel. And the other one was just a poor old guy that

16:04.719 --> 16:10.426
could hardly speak the English language. But he 
had a feel for airplanes, and he listened and paid

16:12.267 --> 16:16.951
good attention. He said, the guy, this dumb old 
guy, he said, he just, he was a fantastic pilot. The

16:22.816 --> 16:28.841
other guy that was a real brain, he just never did 
really learn to fly. And he said, it just goes to

16:28.861 --> 16:33.345
show you, the dumber they are, the better you can 
fly. He turned around and walked away about 10

16:34.026 --> 16:40.992
feet, stopped, turned around and looked at us, and 
he said, you two guys ought to make damn good

16:34.026 --> 16:40.992
pilots.

16:47.131 --> 16:58.847
So I remember him with a lot of chuckles, but I also 
remember him for being a great pilot and a great

16:47.131 --> 16:58.847
teacher. And he was that. And a lot of other 
experiences. I guess one of my most fun

17:03.473 --> 17:15.028
experiences in B-29,

17:03.473 --> 17:15.028
as photo reconnaissance groups, we didn't carry 
bombs. All of our bomb bays were stripped out and

17:16.325 --> 17:22.751
our bomb bays were filled with gas tanks. And we 
could fly probably 22 or 23 hours on non-stop

17:22.771 --> 17:33.441
missions. The longest mission I had was 21 hours 
and 55 minutes. And it was at the beginning of that

17:37.625 --> 17:41.248
particular mission because we were loaded with 
gas. All we could get on board.

17:46.548 --> 18:02.444
We needed to be up to Japan about 9 o'clock in the 
morning because the shadows were right to take

17:46.548 --> 18:02.444
pictures and we could, the pictures could be, you 
could tell more about the pictures and what they

17:46.548 --> 18:02.444
meant. Right. Height of buildings and different 
things. And so we were going to leave Guam that

18:06.248 --> 18:09.872
night at 1.30. Most of our flights we took off at 
night, got up there in the daytime. So it was 1,700

18:15.016 --> 18:18.260
miles from there to Tokyo. And B-29s and crews were 
about 250, something like that. Used a little bit

18:24.609 --> 18:28.374
more power, didn't need to save fuel. We could, 
275. But it wasn't, then it was a fast air crane, but

18:31.318 --> 18:34.542
not today. But we were loaded and our stall speed 
was, as I recall, was about 135. And I remember we

18:45.695 --> 18:50.562
were on an 8,000-foot runway when we took off that 
night. The moon was shining, and we gave it the gun

18:51.443 --> 18:55.589
with all we had. We got right on the end of the runway 
and held the brakes until we revved up the props

18:55.629 --> 19:03.840
full speed and then released the brakes so we could 
get all we could go. And at the end of the paved

19:05.322 --> 19:14.655
runway, they had bulldozed the coral back for 
probably half a mile. And then there was about a 50

19:16.289 --> 19:22.575
foot rise over a little, actually a little 
mountain type thing. And then about a 250 foot drop

19:22.795 --> 19:27.560
to the water just to straighten out the cliff. And 
when we went off the end of the runway, we were still

19:28.741 --> 19:32.064
doing about 130. There was no way we could stop. And 
we didn't want to hit that cliff out there with

19:35.708 --> 19:39.632
about 10,000 gallons of fuel.

19:42.594 --> 19:45.317
And so we just hit emergency power. gave it all she 
had, and we still had some coral. And I had the

19:49.694 --> 19:52.778
co-pilot and said, you read off the speed. And as 
soon as our speed hit about 137, just two miles

19:52.818 --> 20:00.026
above that, I just started pulling back on the 
stick. And I just, I didn't look at anything except

20:00.567 --> 20:05.773
the airspeed indicator. And if it looked like it 
was going to drop, I dropped the nose. And I just

20:08.716 --> 20:11.980
hoped we were going to climb enough to get over the 
cliff. And we were sitting there and the plane was

20:12.922 --> 20:18.991
so close to the stall speed until you could feel it 
shake. It wasn't really stable in the air. It

20:23.838 --> 20:31.329
needed to be more than two or three miles above the 
stall speed to be stable. But then just what seemed

20:31.349 --> 20:40.482
like hours almost was obviously a minute or a 
minute and a half. I can see the reflection of the

20:41.086 --> 20:43.249
moon in the water. And I just shoved the nose down. 
And we picked up speed and pulled it on out. Climbed

20:51.438 --> 20:57.025
up a little bit, put it on autopilot, and then just 
felt my blood turn to ice water. But it didn't turn

20:59.188 --> 21:06.216
to ice water prior to that because you can't. Too 
busy. Too many things going on out there to get

21:06.777 --> 21:09.180
scared. But it was a little bit frightening.

21:13.807 --> 21:20.036
Could you please describe your experience and 
what you saw on the dropping of the atomic bomb on

21:13.807 --> 21:20.036
Hiroshima? Okay.

21:23.982 --> 21:40.607
Our crew, again, took off from Guam around 2 
o'clock in the morning and arrived over the coast

21:23.982 --> 21:40.607
of Japan

21:23.982 --> 21:40.607
probably 8 o'clock or so. Three crews had been 
selected to go up on the special mission. We were

21:47.039 --> 21:49.161
designated to go to Hiroshima. Another crew was 
sent to another area, and another one to another,

21:49.221 --> 21:57.068
and I'm not quite sure. They had the primary 
target, a secondary, and a third alternate. In

22:04.875 --> 22:11.421
case of weather or something, if one didn't work 
out, they'd go to another. We did not know what we

22:12.278 --> 22:15.122
were going to photograph. We were told where to be, 
be above 30,000 feet, to circle Hiroshima

22:16.144 --> 22:33.110
within a radius of about 10 miles, no closer than 
10, and stay fairly close to 10. Keep all cameras on

22:35.033 --> 22:39.720
board, of which we had coverage every angle on the 
aircraft except the 45 degree coming up. And we had

22:46.510 --> 22:52.877
every camera going and taking a picture every five 
seconds or several hours. And so we were to be

22:54.639 --> 23:08.914
there, arrive at that time, certain time, and just 
start circling and observe everything that

22:54.639 --> 23:08.914
happened, be sure the cameras were operating 
appropriately, keep them full of film, just keep

22:54.639 --> 23:08.914
everything going. watch what's going on and take a 
lot of pictures. That was our instructions. So we

23:15.422 --> 23:32.386
arrived at our target Hiroshima was just off the 
nose and we turned to the right so I turned to the

23:15.422 --> 23:32.386
right so I could circle and Hiroshima would be on my 
left because I was in the pilot seat. And we began

23:32.406 --> 23:38.935
our circle and before we had just after we had 
started to circling.

23:44.140 --> 23:50.850
One of the gunners called out B-29

23:44.140 --> 23:50.850
approaching on the right. And we all looked and we 
saw a B-29. As he came across in front of our nose

23:55.276 --> 24:06.913
just a little above us, we could read the marking on 
the tail and we knew that the aircraft was from the

23:55.276 --> 24:06.913
20th Air Force And we knew it had either come from 
Guam or Saipan or Tinian, one of the three fields.

24:14.684 --> 24:16.787
So we watched it come across. It kind of came over in 
front of us across Hiroshima. And then just about

24:21.173 --> 24:24.217
the time it crossed Hiroshima, he really dropped 
his nose. Just really a steep dive. And just moved

24:27.661 --> 24:32.648
way on out and turned off to the left a little bit. 
And we just observed this, and one of the gunners

24:33.792 --> 24:37.997
just remarked, said, well, let him go. You know, we 
hadn't seen anything and had no idea why he was

24:38.898 --> 24:43.743
doing this. And we were observing him, like, you 
know, why did he dive out so quickly? And about this

24:52.252 --> 24:58.599
time, then, just this brilliant flash. It was a 
sunny and bright day. on the one hand and yet this

25:04.538 --> 25:10.767
brilliant flash just out there in Hiroshima. And 
it just covered that area and then of course this

25:11.427 --> 25:26.168
huge orange ball first covered the city and then 
you could see debris and this cloud of smoke going

25:11.427 --> 25:26.168
up. And we were at 33,000 feet and it took less than 
three minutes for that column of smoke to reach our

25:26.248 --> 25:31.575
altitude. which would give you some idea of the 
amount of heat in it because it was rising because

25:32.129 --> 25:36.975
of the heat. And so we, you know, there were 
comments like, you know, look at that, what was

25:38.216 --> 25:49.149
that, you know, what in the world, you know, like 
this. And we knew that this aircraft had done

25:50.110 --> 25:57.799
something, obviously, but of course none of us had 
ever heard of an atomic bomb. And we hadn't been

25:58.623 --> 26:02.309
instructed or anything on what was happening. And 
we speculated that, boy, he must have hit a huge

26:04.011 --> 26:08.538
ammunition dump. And someone said, well, yeah, 
but there must have been a lot of fuel too because

26:09.440 --> 26:18.294
all that smoke and everything, and you can see the 
fires burning and everything. But I mean, it

26:18.334 --> 26:22.460
looked just like total chaos, you know, on the 
ground. And then this smoke coming in. So, you

26:24.965 --> 26:33.978
know, for the next 10 to 15 minutes, all kinds of 
speculation about the crew and all those,

26:24.965 --> 26:33.978
wondering what in the world had taken place here. 
So we continued to circle for, I would guess, about

26:34.038 --> 26:40.026
another two hours. And then, after that time, we 
had been instructed to fly over a few miles, but not

26:42.189 --> 26:52.283
too far, and begin mapping. And we would just fly 
over to a place go down and fly back across and back

26:54.783 --> 27:02.890
over, just making an aerial map of the entire 
Japan. We had a lot of missions that included that.

27:05.313 --> 27:22.208
We'd go up and do special things, whatever they 
needed, and then said, okay, after you finish

27:05.313 --> 27:22.208
that, go over and you start at this point, start 
mapping, and back and forth, just map, map, taking

27:05.313 --> 27:22.208
pictures, and, you know, preparation for an 
invasion, And so we did that, and even during this

27:23.588 --> 27:36.580
time, we had our cameras on board, and we were still 
getting pictures off in the distance, probably

27:23.588 --> 27:36.580
30, 40 miles away of this Columbus home. And so we 
did this until, you know, mid-afternoon, gas and

27:36.600 --> 27:46.369
fuel were in the position where it was time to go 
home. So we headed back for our 1700 mile. slow

27:51.128 --> 27:53.551
descent from there to Guam. How long were you in the 
air total? We left about 2 o'clock in the morning

27:58.717 --> 28:09.130
and arrived back at Guam I believe around 9 o'clock 
in the evening. That's a lot of hours. What did you

28:12.634 --> 28:19.583
feel, what were your thoughts after you heard 
President Truman get on the and get on the radio and

28:20.120 --> 28:23.343
describe what had just happened? Well, we had, as 
we came in that evening, we, as always, our crews

28:23.363 --> 28:40.242
were met by intelligence officers from 20th Air 
Force Headquarters, just to talk to us a few

28:23.363 --> 28:40.242
minutes, see if we observed anything, if there was 
any kind of anti-aircraft or fighter aircraft or

28:23.363 --> 28:40.242
anything. Anything we observed, either there or 
on the ground, troop movements, anything, they

28:40.762 --> 28:49.992
always wanted to know about it because all little 
bits of information made sense and things. And so

28:51.170 --> 29:04.287
they interrogated the crew for a few minutes and 
then we were dismissed and went on with our buddies

28:51.170 --> 29:04.287
and spent a couple of hours in the evening, had a 
nice dinner, talked with them for a while. So we

29:04.307 --> 29:09.494
were telling everybody about what we'd seen and 
what had happened and what speculation it was. We

29:10.495 --> 29:14.461
said, well, why don't we call the 20th Air Force 
Headquarters and find out what they hit. And

29:14.821 --> 29:17.465
everybody said, well, it's kind of late, we'll do 
that in the morning. So we all went off to bed. Well,

29:21.089 --> 29:25.174
after a mission like that, we were allowed to just 
sleep in the next day. If you wanted to get up at noon

29:25.254 --> 29:29.459
or 6 p.m., you could do it. Because you were really 
worn out and tired. After 18 or 20 hours in an

29:32.123 --> 29:37.930
aircraft, you're tired.

29:41.394 --> 29:47.822
Some of my buddies came over and woke me up and said, 
hey, President's on the radio. come listen to

29:48.545 --> 29:49.866
this. He's going to explain what you saw 
yesterday." And so I jumped up. I was interested

29:55.331 --> 30:00.155
and I went, well this must be something else for the 
President to explain it, you know. So we listened

30:00.175 --> 30:06.281
then and we heard the President explain about this 
dropping of the first atomic bomb and what it was.

30:07.321 --> 30:11.725
And that's the first thing that we realized and 
recognized what this was. And we talked about it

30:13.607 --> 30:18.231
and really they explained about the damage it had 
done and the number of people that had been killed.

30:23.917 --> 30:36.609
And they explained about, particularly about the 
fact that they had explained this to Japan and what

30:23.917 --> 30:36.609
it was and asked them to surrender. And just gave 
them a certain length of time to surrender. And

30:42.555 --> 30:46.558
this brought great joy to us. Everyone on the 
island of Guam. I happened to have a nephew who was a

30:50.256 --> 30:54.723
doctor at that time. He was on, he was in the Navy. He 
was on detached service with the 6th Marine Corps

30:57.827 --> 31:00.891
Division on Guam. And they were, had been pulled 
back from Okinawa and were resting there

31:02.033 --> 31:09.443
recuperating, training and preparing to invade 
Japan. And they dreaded it. They knew how fanatic

31:12.448 --> 31:16.954
the Japanese were and they dreaded it. They knew 
that perhaps most of them would not return. And so

31:23.933 --> 31:28.578
we had often met and sat and talked about that, 
about this invasion. And we were going to play a big

31:29.479 --> 31:30.840
part in it. Of course, we'd be up above taking 
pictures and doing things of this nature. On the

31:35.845 --> 31:43.213
one hand, on the other hand, we expected 
everything they had to be thrown against us,

31:35.845 --> 31:43.213
anti-aircraft guns, fighter aircraft, 
everything. Even suicidal missions to fly, just

31:45.903 --> 31:50.529
fly them into aircraft. So no one looked forward to 
that. So here, all of a sudden, when something came

31:53.893 --> 32:06.848
just, you know, out of the clear blue to us that 
could potentially end the war any day now, we were

31:53.893 --> 32:06.848
elated. I'm going to be very honest with you. We 
were elated. And at that time, And I guess I would

32:13.163 --> 32:16.227
have to say that was my feeling at that point. We 
were elated.

32:21.333 --> 32:26.680
What about, what were your feelings when we 
dropped the second one on Nagasaki? Well we had

32:26.700 --> 32:35.151
waited these few days to try to see, hoping Japan 
would surrender and end the war. And they didn't.

32:36.632 --> 32:41.078
And so the second one was sent over and dropped at 
Nagasaki.

32:43.690 --> 32:44.371
Nagasaki. Nagasaki. And we just said, well, 
hopefully this will do it. And I guess that was our

32:51.777 --> 32:53.199
feelings then. I don't think anyone relished the 
killing of that many people on the one hand. But if

33:02.667 --> 33:11.655
you look at it from our standpoint, where probably 
a million or more men would be invading Japan, and

33:12.547 --> 33:17.472
probably half of them or more may never come back, 
of our own people. Plus, what that would do, not

33:18.453 --> 33:26.100
just to their soldiers, but their women and their 
children. And, you know, there would have been

33:27.741 --> 33:32.146
hundreds of thousands of people killed in that 
invasion. Those two bombs killed, what, 200,000

33:33.347 --> 33:38.892
people on that range? And so if you look at it from 
that standpoint, there were many less deaths from

33:40.019 --> 33:56.880
those two bombs that ended the war and brought 
peace than there would have been had we been

33:40.019 --> 33:56.880
required or necessary to invade China and end it 
that way. And so looking at it to that point, from

33:58.182 --> 34:07.714
our standpoint, our feelings, it was a great 
blessing, as bad as it was. Overall, it was a great

34:08.515 --> 34:09.857
blessing. And if you really look at it 
realistically, there's just no denying that. It

34:19.245 --> 34:21.747
saved many, many lives.

34:28.574 --> 34:36.942
I guess then, in your opinion, we should have 
dropped the bomb then for the purpose of stopping

34:28.574 --> 34:36.942
the war. for the purpose of stopping the war. They 
took two of them. The first one just didn't do it. I

34:41.455 --> 34:48.082
guess they were so stunned by it, it takes a while 
for something like that to soak in, I think. Just,

34:49.263 --> 34:53.187
you know, how powerful this is, what it can do. And 
very shortly after the second one was dropped, of

34:54.768 --> 34:58.012
course they did surrender. Total, unconditional 
surrender.

35:04.580 --> 35:08.443
We put them back on their feet again, and they've 
done very well since. Yes. Very, very well.

35:14.168 --> 35:33.405
And in September of 1965, a writer for the New York 
Times by the name of William L. Lawrence, who

35:14.168 --> 35:33.405
actually was in the bomb, or the plane that carried 
the bomb to Nagasaki, he was writing in regards

35:14.168 --> 35:33.405
to... to that bombing. And one of his quotes, it 
says, does one feel pity or compassion for the poor

35:36.968 --> 35:42.156
devils about to die? Not when one thinks of Pearl 
Harbor or the death march on Bataan. Were these

35:47.684 --> 35:52.131
sentiments kind of the feeling of everybody out 
there? Or, you know, if so, explain. Do people

35:56.057 --> 35:57.779
really believe that? Yeah, I think so. You know, 
here, I was a 19 year old guy through my training. I

36:10.453 --> 36:13.577
was a 20 year old when I experienced this. I'd had a 
lot of experiences in life and gained a lot of

36:15.379 --> 36:22.426
maturity over, because of the circumstances at 
the time. But I was young. And really, we had been

36:25.950 --> 36:34.780
taught all the way through cadet school and films 
and everything. to, I mean, basically to hate the

36:35.806 --> 36:38.330
Japanese. Because of Pearl Harbor, because of the 
way they fought, because of the way they treated

36:39.051 --> 36:44.400
our prisoners.

36:46.984 --> 36:50.029
You were just almost taught that they were just not 
human beings. In a sense. That, you know, to wipe

36:52.553 --> 36:57.481
them off the face of the earth would be good rhythm, 
so to speak. It was almost like that. And I'm saying

37:00.265 --> 37:03.450
this on a hindsight basis, but we were, we were 
really Well, they were the enemy. It was destroy

37:07.663 --> 37:11.849
them before they destroy you type situation. 
Self-defense. You get them, they get you. Be

37:14.893 --> 37:15.754
alert. Don't be tricked. In fact, we were very 
explicitly told, if you get shot down, if it's at

37:19.079 --> 37:32.998
all possible, don't bail out because you probably 
will never reach the ground. And history taught us

37:34.025 --> 37:36.328
this. They'd shoot you in a parachute. Or if they 
captured you, they might just cut your head off.

37:43.358 --> 37:44.679
You may or may not be in prison. If you did get in 
prison, it would be horrible. If possible, glide

37:48.685 --> 37:56.856
out or anything you can do and ditch in the ocean or 
bail out over the ocean or whatever. But if you can

37:57.737 --> 38:00.000
get away from the coast, do so. Even if you can land 
in Tokyo Harbor. And we had, it wasn't known

38:03.893 --> 38:19.290
outside to us and a few other people at the time, we 
had submarines in Tokyo Bay that would pick up

38:03.893 --> 38:19.290
pilots and bring them back home. And air crew 
people and a lot were saved. They would get out away

38:22.474 --> 38:33.006
from the land and the submarine would stick the 
periscope up, you could throw a rope over and

38:22.474 --> 38:33.006
they'd just tow you out. until dark or it was far 
enough away and they'd done it around the surface,

38:33.290 --> 38:38.375
bring you on board and gone. So we were taught about 
this, we were trained like this. We didn't think

38:45.283 --> 38:52.190
much about the poor devils down there. After what 
they did to Pearl Harbor and stuff like that. That

38:56.815 --> 38:59.278
wasn't in our makeup at that time, it wasn't in our 
training. We were not taught compassion. Not

39:03.412 --> 39:04.694
during the war? Not at that time. I just read that 
statement, and I just found it kind of interesting

39:06.015 --> 39:14.505
that he wrote that, because it really kind of hit 
me. Something that I thought a lot of people would

39:15.626 --> 39:19.951
kind of feel the same, or I didn't know if anybody 
felt different. Well, you know, today, in the

39:19.971 --> 39:32.406
light of day, you think about it, and obviously you 
would have compassion about one person who is

39:19.971 --> 39:32.406
about to die, let alone If you actually knew, I'm 
going to drop this bomb and 100,000 is going to die.

39:39.379 --> 39:51.911
Even in times like that, I suppose, if you really 
knew exactly what you were about to do and the

39:39.379 --> 39:51.911
circumstances there, I'm sure you'd have some 
compassionate thoughts about it. You'd know that

39:52.812 --> 40:01.380
some of those were soldiers and things that you 
were taught to kill, but you'd also know that there

39:52.812 --> 40:01.380
were a lot of mothers, a lot of children, a lot of 
babies, Many things. I don't think you could help

40:03.818 --> 40:11.569
but think of your mother, your sisters, your 
little brothers, your nieces and nephews. I

40:11.630 --> 40:18.740
think you'd shake your head. You'd go ahead and do 
your duty. But you would have some compassion.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.973
Definitely so. How do you feel about atomic 
weapons now and the way they've developed? I think

40:34.608 --> 40:40.275
they've been overdeveloped to a large extent.

40:41.236 --> 40:54.731
I believe, you know, Stuart, it's extremely 
important

40:41.236 --> 40:54.731
and maybe this is the will of the Lord that the 
United States develop this weapon first. We used

40:56.773 --> 40:58.215
it twice to end war, a very great and bloody war. The 
bloodiest part was still to come, and we avoided

41:04.026 --> 41:11.414
that by the use of these two bombs. It's my opinion 
that our possession of that bomb has kept the peace

41:11.434 --> 41:19.783
over these years. I fully believe that. I think 
there are forces on this earth, have been, and

41:22.485 --> 41:28.692
still even today, that would love to conquer the 
United States of America and have a different form

41:29.819 --> 41:38.932
of government here. Totalitarian, communist, 
both of which are totalitarian, or whatever.

41:45.902 --> 41:49.007
We're a free nation. We're the envy of everyone. 
And we have the freedom that people envy and enjoy.

41:56.678 --> 41:58.020
And they would like to take that away from us. I 
believe the atomic bomb, its possession, by our

41:59.738 --> 42:09.311
country has protected us from no telling what. 
There have been wars, but they have been limited

42:09.331 --> 42:12.756
wars. They've been smaller wars, so to speak.

42:17.683 --> 42:25.173
Simply because they were afraid to expand it to the 
point to where we or anyone else would use the

42:17.683 --> 42:25.173
atomic bomb. And so Because of that, I think it has 
been a great deterrent.

42:33.817 --> 42:35.779
We and all of us have too much of it now. The only fear 
I have, I don't particularly fear us having it, I

42:35.839 --> 42:39.903
don't fear Russia having it. Because it's a 
standoff. And neither one of us will take that

42:42.586 --> 42:44.328
step. My great fear right now would be some lunatic 
type individual, the head of a government, or of a

42:57.451 --> 43:11.708
terrorist organization that would somehow 
acquire one of these and use it for blackmail or for

42:57.451 --> 43:11.708
the great destruction it can cause. And there are 
people of that mindset around them,

43:11.728 --> 43:22.480
unfortunately, but they are.
