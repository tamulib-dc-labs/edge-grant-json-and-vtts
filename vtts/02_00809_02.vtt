00:02.883 --> 00:16.217
The city could

00:02.883 --> 00:16.217
have got help from the government. I know one night 
I was at a community meeting over in Brown and our

00:16.366 --> 00:39.505
representative in Washington was at that meeting 
and he told us that he could get us some help and I

00:16.366 --> 00:39.505
remember that I In reply to that offer, I told him 
that we didn't want any help, that we would live

00:40.396 --> 01:06.690
within our means, and that we would hope to grow, 
but I personally didn't like the idea of somebody

00:40.396 --> 01:06.690
else carrying our load.

01:08.510 --> 01:13.039
I've already told you we had no bonded 
indebtedness. We took these utilities over and

01:13.060 --> 01:19.353
paid for them. After a few years you see we got it 
done but we used the income from the water and from

01:29.283 --> 01:34.948
the electricity to pay them off. And we got out and 
owning those systems without having to borrow

01:35.749 --> 01:41.594
money. But I did. The first money that the city ever 
borrowed was when Ernest Langford, the man who

01:44.577 --> 01:56.708
succeeded me as mayor, came to me about a year after 
he had been in office and asked me if I would loan

01:57.076 --> 02:02.724
them $500, which I did. And as a friend to me, he 
says, now, this is going to be the last bill we pay

02:04.187 --> 02:15.704
back, so you can really make something out of it.

02:19.529 --> 02:23.455
Now, that's, oh, my, I get to slide. I don't know 
where to begin or where to quit. I bet. I bet he is.

02:31.239 --> 02:33.222
Well, why did you decide to run for office? Why did 
you decide to be the mayor? I told these people when

02:37.869 --> 02:40.313
they came around. They were good friends of mine. I 
told them, I don't know where to thank you or insult

02:42.216 --> 02:46.222
you. Some people came and asked you to be mayor? 
Yes. Who were they? Well, Mr. Barton is the only one

02:50.689 --> 02:52.952
left. Mr. Bonin was on that committee. He came and 
asked me if I'd run. And the faculty was on my side in

02:58.292 --> 03:04.183
all this trouble with the college and the board of 
directors. The faculty was just, oh, they just

03:04.684 --> 03:09.653
were so pleased with me. Because I got these 
roughnecks off of the freshmen. And this school

03:16.827 --> 03:18.710
started to grow in. And the faculty was with me. But 
they were, they didn't dare say anything. They

03:25.763 --> 03:36.783
didn't come out and publish that they were farming 
because the board of directors might have fired

03:25.763 --> 03:36.783
them because the board of directors wanted to keep 
the system. They were all Aggies. I remember one

03:41.296 --> 03:51.906
time I had a meeting with, the senior class had a 
meeting, they asked me to come to it over in the old

03:41.296 --> 03:51.906
YMCA. The old YMCA used to have a chapel and that's 
all into rooms. It's where a whole lot of the office

03:56.971 --> 04:02.557
work of the college is now. But it's the one with the 
big steps. Sure, I know where it is.

04:13.072 --> 04:24.187
Well,

04:13.072 --> 04:24.187
you were saying that you were having a meeting. Oh, 
I was having a meeting with these boys. I remember

04:27.151 --> 04:30.135
old Joe Routt. Joe Routt Boulevard's name for him. 
He says, won't you please quit trying to change our

04:33.780 --> 04:39.788
school? I said, Joe...

04:46.417 --> 04:49.362
I said, Joe, this school doesn't belong to you. It 
belongs to the state of Texas. You don't have

04:52.006 --> 04:53.088
rights. You don't have a right to do things you want 
to do and what these boys have been doing around

04:53.809 --> 04:58.597
here. Somebody has to do something about it. And 
I'm going to do something about it. Because it's

05:05.789 --> 05:12.340
not right for you to think it's all right for you to 
run off these freshmen like you're doing. Well, he

05:12.360 --> 05:19.231
said, we'd rather have 1,500 agas than 15,000 tea 
sippers. I said, I'm just as tough as you are, and

05:20.634 --> 05:24.440
maybe a whole lot tougher. So you haven't got 
anything to be proud of. I respect A&M. I love A&M. I

05:34.556 --> 05:36.058
want to do something for A&M. I've been here 12 
years already. And I'm determined to do it. All

05:42.886 --> 05:48.774
right, they go over and tell Dr. Walton they want to 
get rid of me. And then Dr. Walton asks the board of

05:49.775 --> 05:53.059
directors to come up here. And the board of 
directors have a meeting. And they ask for this

05:55.766 --> 06:01.553
senior, and this senior, and this senior, and this 
senior, or come down there, and they don't ask for

05:55.766 --> 06:01.553
me. I went down there, and I said, listen, you came 
up here to investigate something, and I want you to

06:03.295 --> 06:15.189
start out with me, rather than not everybody else 
but me. I'm doing something for you. You can't

06:17.712 --> 06:18.813
hire. You've had lots of commandants, and none of 
them have done what they ought to do. You ought to

06:24.224 --> 06:27.328
know better yourselves.

06:28.370 --> 06:33.296
You either want my what I want, or you don't want me. 
Now, that's just up to you now. You can just tell me

06:36.260 --> 06:39.905
to close out and go. They didn't dare do it. They 
would like to have done it, but the state of Texas is

06:42.449 --> 06:52.122
on my side,

06:42.449 --> 06:52.122
and they didn't dare do it. And they just said, oh, 
you've done a wonderful job. You saved us this last

06:55.845 --> 07:04.060
year $15,000 on broken up furniture and slats 
kicked out of doors. These boys just knock off

07:04.120 --> 07:08.729
their screens and throw them away. They just rough 
on everything. They had no consideration for

07:10.652 --> 07:13.738
anybody else. They took advantage of the 
situation and messed up the furniture. Well, I

07:23.368 --> 07:27.533
told Dr. Walton they're going to quit that. When I 
took the job, I said, now there's certain things,

07:27.573 --> 07:32.879
Dr. Walton, I'm going to see if they don't do. I'm 
going to make them sign for this room, everything

07:33.800 --> 07:38.425
that's in it, just like it is. And they are going to 
have to replace anything. They're going to have to

07:42.109 --> 07:44.472
pay for it. And I made them do it. They didn't like 
that. They didn't like a lot of things. They made

07:49.944 --> 08:01.287
the freshmen stay in their rooms from the time they 
were out, unless they were out in some company

07:49.944 --> 08:01.287
sport or something like that. They made them stay 
in their rooms.

08:06.368 --> 08:09.913
They were room-bound after their last class. They 
couldn't go to Brown. They couldn't go visit

08:11.636 --> 08:13.318
somebody else. They stayed in their thing so they 
could be there to run errands for the

08:13.358 --> 08:18.346
upperclassmen and things like that. I talked to 
Dean Bolton and asked him, let's do something

08:19.728 --> 08:28.681
about some of these things. He says, oh, well, 
let's don't be too in a hurry like that. I said, now

08:33.402 --> 08:40.517
let's let them go to Brown after December the 10th, 
which is the first grade. If they pass all the work

08:41.359 --> 08:49.335
due for December the 10th, I'm going to say that 
they ought to be allowed to leave that room and stay

08:41.359 --> 08:49.335
out until quarter to quarters. Well, he wouldn't 
agree with me. Next year, I didn't talk to him. I

08:55.378 --> 08:59.703
just passed a rule and published it. Freshman, if 
you are passing your work on December the 10th, you

08:59.983 --> 09:04.388
are a free man. I don't want to see you in your room 
unless you're studying. I rubbed it in on him.

09:13.198 --> 09:19.525
Listen, I have gone up to that campus and found a 
sophomore drilling the freshman at 3 o'clock in

09:13.198 --> 09:19.525
the morning. It was just a system that was too hard 
in running people away. Huh? It was something that

09:27.970 --> 09:30.353
was scaring people off. Is that right? Well, it was 
something to keep them from studying. That's

09:35.278 --> 09:36.700
right. They did everything they could to run them 
off. They said, just like Joe Wright said, we're

09:39.403 --> 09:44.609
making aggies here. Rough stuff, real stuff. 
Texas A&M, as their chief yells, And we were the

09:50.858 --> 09:55.924
bullies of the conference. Nobody liked us. They 
would crash the gate. They'd just go to the games.

10:05.156 --> 10:05.657
Unruly. Nobody down here would do anything about 
it. Well, I took the two or three army officers that

10:09.061 --> 10:13.947
were supposed to be working with the and we told 
these people, now listen, don't you get caught up

10:14.568 --> 10:24.543
there without a, don't you get caught up there 
without a ticket. Now that happened after we took

10:25.525 --> 10:41.689
the first football team to, well the first court 
trip went up to TCU and the Texas Hotel and don't go

10:25.525 --> 10:41.689
on if they didn't run off with all the towels and 
linen and, well it was the same thing, they wanted

10:25.525 --> 10:41.689
to take one man, Charles, His name was, I can't 
think of it right now, his first name was Charles.

10:46.752 --> 10:48.514
He was a senior, he took a floor lamp. All we did, all 
we did was just, they always drilled on Thursday

10:50.195 --> 10:56.401
afternoon. They were out with the army officers 
drilling. Nobody in their rooms. Didn't have

11:00.845 --> 11:02.927
anybody but cadets in those days. Just military 
pure. So we in the commandant's office, we had pass

11:06.130 --> 11:11.895
keys to every dormitory. And so we went there. They 
ran off with just all kinds of stuff. And so the man

11:19.812 --> 11:30.783
wrote me after he got back home and said, we don't 
think we'd keep A&M teams anymore because they ran

11:19.812 --> 11:30.783
off all that stuff. I wrote him back. I said, well, 
you know who's in that room and you know what to do.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.490
Just make me a list of that. And they made me a list of 
that, and I sent for those boys one at a time. I said,

11:44.408 --> 11:55.362
you're lucky that you're not shipped from school, 
but you sit right down here and sign this letter

11:44.408 --> 11:55.362
that's already written where you apologize for 
stealing that towel. And you're going to take it

11:57.145 --> 12:07.819
right over here in front of me and put it in this 
envelope, mail this envelope and this package,

11:57.145 --> 12:07.819
which you're going to wrap right now. And we're 
going to send that back to the hotel with your

12:08.508 --> 12:13.434
apologies for taking it. And you're not going on 
any other court trip this year. You're going to

12:18.541 --> 12:19.783
stay here. I'm putting you in the bullring. I don't 
care where he's a senior or where he was a freshman.

12:25.190 --> 12:29.956
If he took something from that room, they must have 
taken 500 things. Oh, no.

12:34.202 --> 12:34.582
Let's see. Oh, we were talking about the election. 
When you were mayor and a committee of citizens

12:38.377 --> 12:45.726
asked you to run, is that right? Yes, that's right. 
Do you remember that election? Did anyone run

12:48.128 --> 12:49.450
against you? There was a student. A student 
decided to run? I don't know. He turned out later on

12:56.899 --> 13:00.503
to be a colonel in the army. But I don't know, he 
didn't get any votes. The students couldn't vote.

13:06.937 --> 13:09.980
They didn't know they could if they did. Well, how 
did you govern the town since you didn't have a city

13:10.000 --> 13:14.865
manager? I was the city manager. I was the mayor and 
city manager. I helped put in fire plugs, and we

13:21.593 --> 13:30.523
didn't order anything, but we had very little that 
we ordered. But, and our policeman was the, and I

13:31.516 --> 13:40.687
together

13:31.516 --> 13:40.687
did the job. So it must have taken a lot of your time. 
It took all, every morning, all morning long,

13:44.191 --> 13:47.155
every morning. For two years. Were there, had 
y'all talked about putting in a city manager? Do

13:55.946 --> 13:58.088
you know, it wasn't during your term? No, we, that 
happened after, Ernest took it over. Two or three

14:03.390 --> 14:07.094
years after that, I guess, they got a city manager. 
But y'all, you didn't... We never had a city

14:09.476 --> 14:14.481
manager, no, no. During your term, the council and 
yourself voted the ward system in? The ward

14:23.510 --> 14:25.232
system? The awards system. The wards. W-A-R-D-S, 
wards? I don't remember that. Oh, okay. Yeah. All

14:35.918 --> 14:37.301
right.

14:41.869 --> 14:47.299
Oh, College Station has always had a lot of 
emphasis on recreation. Yes. Can you tell me why?

14:53.663 --> 14:58.568
Can I have an opinion as to why they have so much 
recreation?

15:00.910 --> 15:03.532
Well, I think they're just fairly wise people. 
See, I'm a coach. I've given my life to serious

15:06.015 --> 15:13.762
recreation. That is to accomplish something that 
you think is worthwhile that's hard to get. I've

15:23.752 --> 15:31.599
concentrated on helping boys find themselves and 
proving they can go somewhere and do things. Build

15:32.640 --> 15:49.015
strength and determination and confidence in the 
fact that they can do it and win and get ahead of

15:32.640 --> 15:49.015
somebody else in a far way, in a far way always. Now 
that, I don't know, I don't know where this place

15:53.705 --> 15:57.755
is. It's a little unusual, but other people have 
what we have. They don't have a high school coach

16:03.629 --> 16:09.644
like Geesey. He's a Crocker Jack. I hope he's the 
track coach at A&M College sometime, but he can't

16:12.993 --> 16:23.268
be because these boys are doing all right that have 
the job, and he's old as they are, I guess. But he

16:23.288 --> 16:33.644
needs to be rewarded for doing as much as he's doing 
in athletics.

16:33.704 --> 16:39.152
He has the finest track teams in the state, and he 
won it.

16:44.819 --> 16:55.349
I think that recreation,

16:44.819 --> 16:55.349
it's a change. It

16:56.551 --> 17:01.495
gives you a lift.

17:04.538 --> 17:08.562
We need to use our muscle. We need to strengthen 
everything in us. And the only way to build

17:12.086 --> 17:14.168
strength work it in, play it in, use it, and health, 
and long life. Really? As an example, find

17:25.254 --> 17:29.899
yourself. The city has just got through a 
movement, the biggest brush fire you ever saw. You

17:35.025 --> 17:36.606
see these shrubs out there?

17:40.631 --> 17:40.911
I'll call you. I'll send you a file. 503 Fireview, 
and the trees that are in the front yard, I dug them

17:44.843 --> 17:53.035
up and planted them. We bought that house for $600. 
We cut it in two because it had a wing on it, and it was

17:56.159 --> 18:04.371
a little bit too big to move to get down there. So 
they had to cut it in two and then they moved it down

18:04.958 --> 18:07.582
there. It cost $900 to move it, it cost $600 to build 
it, to buy it. But we lived in it until, oh, until our

18:14.333 --> 18:26.754
son decided that we just needed a smaller place, 
easier to take care of and so forth, and so he built

18:14.333 --> 18:26.754
this out and said, come on. I gave that to one of my 
sons, another one, and... He sold it later on, but

18:33.427 --> 18:35.850
it's still a good house. Why did the board of 
directors want you to move off campus? Everybody.

18:45.544 --> 18:48.549
They made a rule that nobody could live on the 
campus but the president. And why was that? Well,

18:51.733 --> 18:56.620
they just didn't want to have to bother building 
homes for them. Oh, I see. See, they probably have

18:58.924 --> 19:01.948
3,500 people. working for them now. And they 
didn't have the space or the money or the

19:04.865 --> 19:09.111
inclination. And they just solved that problem by 
saying, well, just move off. Oh, I see. And so you

19:14.819 --> 19:16.741
bought a house? We bought a house from the college.

19:21.848 --> 19:23.871
An old house that a friend of ours lived in. It was, 
well, heck, it cost, you couldn't put that roof on

19:25.233 --> 19:30.880
that house now for $600. It had a slate roof. It is 
just like it was. It'll be that way, I don't know,

19:36.819 --> 19:43.470
unless there's some awful big hail burst into it. 
It won't leak or it won't wear out. Well, the campus

19:45.894 --> 19:50.281
owned the homes and then certain people could rent 
them? The college owned them. The college built

19:51.983 --> 19:54.227
them and paid for them. And then when they wanted to 
move them off, they just said, we'll sell it to you.

19:59.587 --> 20:05.094
And they just practically gave them to the people 
that bought them. And we bought that home for $600.

20:08.819 --> 20:21.635
Well,

20:08.819 --> 20:21.635
there's been, I've been reading newspapers and 
things, and there's a historic rivalry between

20:08.819 --> 20:21.635
College Station and Bryan. Was that apparent when 
you were mayor? Do you have any examples of that?

20:28.049 --> 20:30.032
Oh, it's no worse or no better. It's just two 
communities.

20:35.962 --> 20:43.114
You can't get two communities that don't have

20:35.962 --> 20:43.114
problems with each other. They live so close 
together, everything is kind of mixed in. We're in

20:48.967 --> 20:57.536
one way, we're just one big, one bigger city, but 
we've got two administrations here and there. I

21:00.138 --> 21:16.375
used to keep my funds and what little I had

21:00.138 --> 21:16.375
in the First National Bank, but, and I used to 
belong to the, to the, to the Quantas Club over

21:00.138 --> 21:16.375
there in Bryan. But then when they had them out 
here, I just pulled up and came out here. Just left

21:21.729 --> 21:27.656
their bank and I left their clubs and came on out 
here because this is where I live. Would people

21:28.478 --> 21:36.167
have been happy if Bryan had become their city and 
asked for the land? Well, if they'd just wiped out

21:36.768 --> 21:43.797
the boundary and had one headquarters and been one 
city. It could have been done all right.

21:52.451 --> 21:54.995
We had our friends in Brown. We had no problems at 
all, except just the fact that the merchants, when

21:55.035 --> 22:05.271
they had a store out here, they didn't want us to go 
over there and buy stuff. And

22:05.531 --> 22:12.602
when a man built a house out here, We didn't want 
Brian to be furnishing electricity, for

22:13.966 --> 22:18.511
instance. Things like that had to be solved. That 
was one of

22:22.034 --> 22:26.559
them. Did you encourage any commercial 
development when you were mayor? No, none

22:31.023 --> 22:32.485
whatsoever. You wanted it to remain a... I 
wouldn't have been good for College Station

22:37.570 --> 22:41.914
because I don't like to go in debt. When I graduated 
from college, I borrowed $10 to help me get to the

22:47.606 --> 22:56.435
Kansas harvest fields. I haven't borrowed 
anybody since. I don't like to go in debt either. I

23:03.242 --> 23:03.982
haven't. And we're fairly well off. We're doing 
all right. Things, I've made more one way or

23:12.134 --> 23:22.745
another since I had the job with the college

23:12.134 --> 23:22.745
than I did then. I came out here for $2,400 and after 
10 years I'm making $2,700.

23:38.222 --> 23:42.006
Living in a college house, it cost me $20 a month It 
didn't belong to that little department. That

23:45.100 --> 23:46.501
little department had two houses. The head coach 
had one and I had the other. So your money went a lot

23:50.124 --> 23:53.207
further those days. We had a cook. We had a cook. Had 
a... We can't afford one now. We have one twice a

23:57.951 --> 23:59.132
week. But then we had one seven days a week. And she 
upraised the kids. Christmas came along one

24:03.815 --> 24:05.317
Christmas. We went to Mexico City with another 
couple and left the kids at home with this very

24:05.357 --> 24:12.803
dependable good old girl. colored girl. We had a 
servant's house and she lived in there and we

24:15.380 --> 24:24.912
furnished the food and everything and paid her 
four dollars a week.

24:24.932 --> 24:26.715
That was the life in those days. That was 
everybody. They didn't, nobody made any money at

24:29.358 --> 24:32.462
A&M College. Why the, the uh, these assistant 
professors probably get as much money as Tom

24:32.923 --> 24:43.617
Harrington got as president.

24:45.335 --> 24:51.966
When you became mayor, did you have a specific plan 
for the city? Did you want to see the city go? Well,

24:53.348 --> 25:00.521
my plan for the city was just do everything you can 
to have a better school. I was chairman of

25:01.843 --> 25:09.115
the equalization board. at one time and we just, 
everybody tried to be a good citizen and support

25:09.972 --> 25:25.303
and expand our schools as people came in and we 
grew.

25:25.323 --> 25:31.575
I've never, I have never felt

25:25.323 --> 25:31.575
like that That the country was, the city or the 
state or the nation was taking advantage of me, I'd

25:33.293 --> 25:40.904
like to pay my taxes.

25:44.028 --> 25:45.771
I don't like to see them wasted, though. That's the 
reason I don't like politicians. I don't like

25:48.314 --> 25:57.407
politicians who get Uncle Sam to support their 
baby at the expense of all the balance of us. We're

25:58.008 --> 25:59.250
going in debt too far. We're going in debt so fast 
that There's a limit. There's a limit. We will go in

26:04.098 --> 26:10.888
debt to where we'd be where Germany was at the end of 
the Second World War. A mark got to where you took a

26:10.908 --> 26:18.979
million marks to buy a pound of butter. Oh, no. It's 
terrible. So if we keep on going like we're going,

26:21.383 --> 26:31.617
though, if we do what the Democrats want us to do and 
spend money like they did spend, now listen. The

26:32.879 --> 26:35.201
Democrats put us where we are. Reagan didn't put us 
where we are. We're going down steeper with Reagan

26:37.463 --> 26:45.931
because they had us going down hell so darn fast we 
can't get stopped.

26:45.951 --> 26:48.353
And he's trying to save us. He's trying to salvage 
our liberty. Can anybody and everybody see what

26:53.418 --> 26:57.822
the Soviet Union's doing? They have conquered all 
of their part of Europe, They're now going into

27:02.663 --> 27:04.625
Asia. They've got Cuba. They've got Nicaragua.

27:11.453 --> 27:18.040
And the whole Central America is in a turmoil. If 
they get there, then Mexico may fall next. And

27:23.326 --> 27:29.753
we'll have all of that stuff over there that the 
Soviet Union can launch an attack from. They'll

27:29.793 --> 27:31.995
put their stuff over there. Now, if we can get 
Western Europe to let us put those missiles in to

27:33.865 --> 27:52.421
match up everything they've got, we can delay and 
maybe keep them

27:33.865 --> 27:52.421
off of our necks. If they're allowed to have theirs 
there, they'll get ready. And if they keep on

27:56.745 --> 28:02.590
growing and we don't invest and match them, 
Missiles from missiles, if we get weak and they get

28:04.460 --> 28:18.835
much, much stronger, they'll dictate peace to us 
because they'll tell Europe, who are our allies,

28:04.460 --> 28:18.835
we'll pulverize you. They've already got them up. 
They've got those missiles in place and within

28:21.397 --> 28:30.687
range of leveling every big city in France and 
England and Italy. And they'll say, you make a move

28:31.797 --> 28:39.166
toward, we're going to take the United States on. 
We're going to make them bite the bullet. That

28:43.691 --> 28:46.774
wouldn't be very good. And if the Republican Party 
blocks him from putting those missiles in, that

28:46.794 --> 28:53.562
day will come quicker. If we get ready, they're 
devils. They're liars. They're cheaters.

29:01.430 --> 29:03.232
They're just everything in the world. They just 
want to wipe out a free society. It hurts them.

29:11.802 --> 29:23.016
They're having a hard time because a lot of people 
don't, they're not popular with a lot of people

29:11.802 --> 29:23.016
because they have made the serf a slave. He was a 
serf when Ivan was a serf under the Ghazars. I can

29:29.764 --> 29:31.386
remember all those times. But they just shot all 
the big landowners. They called them the kulaks.

29:37.257 --> 29:45.871
They just shot those people to get them out of the 
way so we could tell the poor folks that are living

29:37.257 --> 29:45.871
on that land what they have to do to balance their 
lives. And the factories there took them over.

29:48.695 --> 29:53.884
They just shot the people that owned them so that 
there wouldn't be any problem with them anymore.

29:55.045 --> 29:59.112
And then they told these people, you're going to 
work. here and you're going to work there and

29:59.699 --> 30:03.646
you're going to support yourselves. We won't help 
you any. We're going to give you enough, but you're

30:05.529 --> 30:10.817
working for us. We're going to skim off the profit. 
This man has a garden. Enough to support and he has

30:19.432 --> 30:22.898
chickens and he has a cow. He has a plow and a hoe. And 
he supports himself, but he has to give most of

30:26.345 --> 30:37.341
those vegetables and that grain and so forth to the 
central pot, to the Soviet Union. And they still

30:37.361 --> 30:39.464
can't feed themselves. Because when you take away 
the desire for profit, people don't work hard.

30:47.596 --> 30:48.678
They're not happy. They don't work. They just 
piddle. They do what they have to do to keep being

30:51.502 --> 30:55.187
shot or sent to Siberia. So they're in bad shape. 
But they're in worse shape as long as we have

30:58.403 --> 31:02.649
freedom. They want to take our freedom away from us 
so that the people won't be able to look off and say

31:02.689 --> 31:09.059
they're better off than we are. And that's the 
reason they want to take us over. Can I ask you, do

31:14.427 --> 31:22.239
you feel like there was a, what was the biggest 
problem that you faced in your term? Did you have

31:22.840 --> 31:23.942
any problems? my biggest problem of my whole life. 
No, no, your term is mayor. Your term is mayor. I

31:32.442 --> 31:34.445
don't think I let it bother me. I don't think I let it 
bother me. Did you, was there any great

31:36.828 --> 31:42.275
achievement that you felt like College Station 
achieved? No, no we just we just paid for the for the

31:42.295 --> 31:52.849
light poles and the wires that went between them 
and the water

31:54.685 --> 32:24.456
stuff pipes that went in the ground to carry the 
water to them we paid off the stuff we took over

31:54.685 --> 32:24.456
from the developers and by that time we were having 
enough income from the sale of electricity and

31:54.685 --> 32:24.456
from the sale of the water we weren't paid we we had a 
one policeman and we had no city manager And we

32:24.790 --> 32:26.432
weren't getting any money. We had one girl and we 
probably paid her $75 a month, I don't know, maybe

32:26.992 --> 32:34.399
$60 a month, I don't know. We didn't have any 
expenses. We used the money we took in to pay up, pay

32:36.060 --> 32:44.488
these people off that built the, put in the 
electric lines and the water system and the sewer

32:36.060 --> 32:44.488
system. We paid them off. The people that live in 
this house paid for those three things. They're

32:50.774 --> 32:53.076
still paying for them. people to pay their way 
rather than go into debt. We didn't owe a dollar.

32:58.636 --> 33:00.238
Didn't owe a dollar. Not one dollar did we owe. Do 
you like the way that College Station has

33:03.121 --> 33:06.325
developed? The way you see it today? I'm not 
criticizing them at all. I think they're lucky

33:09.649 --> 33:11.771
that they didn't have me. I think they're awful 
lucky that they didn't have me because I didn't

33:18.503 --> 33:19.564
care. I wanted the school to grow, but I didn't care 
a thing about College Station growing other than

33:19.584 --> 33:28.732
just give room for the professors. I see. You 
wanted it to remain small, a small college town. A

33:33.897 --> 33:38.221
small college town, yeah.

33:38.341 --> 33:43.685
I told that this man who was down here, and we had 
this meeting over in Bryan. Mrs. Magda Parker used

33:44.946 --> 33:46.688
to have a uh place where she fed a lot of people and uh 
the different the civil clubs met up there and we

33:47.073 --> 34:15.173
had this town meeting for their combined for them 
and here and i told you the man that was the head of

33:47.073 --> 34:15.173
the man that was the head of teague say

33:47.073 --> 34:15.173
you know about teague he was our representative 
for many many many years well he was a he was a boy in

33:47.073 --> 34:15.173
school when I was commandant. And then later on, he 
got to be a second lieutenant. He was that when he

34:24.147 --> 34:25.808
left A&M. Then later on, he was ready and had done 
the work to be a first lieutenant. And I was the

34:34.156 --> 34:44.485
senior officer around this part of the country, 
and so they had two other colonels to come in. And we

34:44.836 --> 34:54.489
three checked him over and made the 
recommendation that he get his promotion to first

34:44.836 --> 34:54.489
lieutenant. So that was what I helped do for 
Congressman Teague. Now, but I like this one

35:00.357 --> 35:05.384
better than that. I like this man's, what he's 
doing more than I did for Tiger Teague. Graham,

35:11.493 --> 35:13.636
you're talking about? Graham, yeah. I have a 
letter from him every week or two. Oh, that's

35:17.600 --> 35:25.751
wonderful.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.715
You were called into World War II. How did the city, 
did the city do anything to prepare for war? Did the

35:34.824 --> 35:40.873
city, did College Station do anything to prepare 
for war, for World War II? Oh yeah, yeah. We had our

35:44.658 --> 35:51.206
committees set up, and we had a lot of people. We 
lived right across the street from somebody who

35:51.947 --> 36:02.922
dug a pit where they could go in case of a bomb threat 
or a bomb. They started bombing anywhere, and they

36:05.104 --> 36:11.813
dug a pit and stocked it with so forth, our 
next-door neighbor. So there was a movement there

36:13.244 --> 36:15.707
to do that. A few people did it, not many of

36:15.727 --> 36:20.693
them. I never was very much excited over that. I 
didn't much think that they were going to do

36:24.879 --> 36:31.708
anything like that at that time. I don't think 
they're going to do anything like that now. I think

36:35.532 --> 36:39.017
that they wouldn't bother small towns, 
certainly. They'd have to, they'd have to hit the

36:39.377 --> 36:43.082
big cities though. In order to win the war, they'd 
have to do that.

36:59.047 --> 37:10.639
Well, is there anything else that you might want to 
add about what the concentration was like before

36:59.047 --> 37:10.639
or just your term as mayor that I haven't 
questioned you about?

37:14.045 --> 37:15.587
Everybody's nice to us. We have a lot of friends and 
we like it. I

37:22.394 --> 37:32.426
don't take any dish though in their duties. I don't 
support anybody that's running for office at

37:33.587 --> 37:41.436
College Station. I don't know enough about them to 
do that. And as far as I can tell, everything's

37:47.320 --> 37:51.625
going along very well.

37:56.491 --> 38:05.482
Now, nationally, I'm taking more interest 
because we can't print money. And the state of

38:06.624 --> 38:09.888
Texas or no other state can print money. But the 
United States government can print money And all

38:14.069 --> 38:17.514
they have to do is to print a little more of it. 
They've printed too much of it already.

38:22.342 --> 38:32.398
The more money they put in circulation, if they pay 
off debts, and if they pay it, we draw Social

38:22.342 --> 38:32.398
Security. We also draw a retired army. I stayed in 
the army between, I stayed active between the two

38:37.306 --> 38:41.933
world wars.

38:45.710 --> 39:06.985
I went to camp two weeks, practically every year, 
and over there we'd have a bunch of A&M

38:45.710 --> 39:06.985
artillerymen that graduated here, and they were 
over there as second lieutenants, or maybe if they

38:45.710 --> 39:06.985
were a little older they were first lieutenants, 
or maybe they might be a captain of the team. That

39:07.045 --> 39:09.869
would be at the A&M artillery group. I was with the 
field artillery.

39:14.093 --> 39:15.675
We had two weeks training there. We worked hard and 
we had a lot of fun together. We always played a

39:19.318 --> 39:20.359
little. We always had a nice little party at the end 
of the thing and it was just a nice experience. And

39:28.047 --> 39:36.034
when World War II came along, they didn't want us. I 
don't think they wanted us. When I got this call, it

39:38.637 --> 39:42.801
says now you don't have to come unless you want to. I 
think they had really rather that we didn't come,

39:43.372 --> 39:52.766
because I was too old to go overseas already, 52. 
And I didn't know that. I didn't know that I wasn't

39:58.534 --> 40:07.287
going to be allowed to go overseas, but they sent me 
and seven other old colonels who had been loyal and

40:08.060 --> 40:12.825
worked good hard with an outfit between the new 
wars. They felt like they just owed it to us to give

40:12.885 --> 40:17.890
us a chance if they wanted to come to come. So we did. 
There were seven of us and we went up to school and we

40:20.473 --> 40:25.458
went through the basic course again. I'd already 
been through the artillery school 1917-18 up at

40:25.498 --> 40:36.109
Fort Sill and then

40:38.401 --> 40:44.690
This time they sent us back and we took the basic 
course, which is much easier than that war course

40:38.401 --> 40:44.690
was. And then after they took the basic course, 
they didn't have anything for us to do, so they just

40:45.591 --> 40:52.481
kept us up there on a board. To do this, investigate 
that, do this, that, and the other, and there's

40:53.162 --> 40:58.089
always something like that going on. And then to 
pick people who have been drafted and they want to

40:58.149 --> 41:07.783
go to a cadet camp where they maybe be second 
lieutenants. get ready to get a promotion you see

41:08.860 --> 41:26.397
and so we we had recommended these people that the 
captains had sent to us we had talked to them and and

41:08.860 --> 41:26.397
if we felt like they offered material we had 
recommended they go to this school things like

41:08.860 --> 41:26.397
that they kept us done for a good many months

41:29.228 --> 41:33.595
And then they finally decided, after all, they 
didn't have anything else much for us to do. And

41:34.797 --> 41:39.404
they sent us up there, and they sent us to different 
places. Sent me to Fort Jackson over in North

41:39.464 --> 41:43.930
Carolina. That's where they ought to have left me 
through the balance of the war. That's where we

41:47.736 --> 41:55.388
were training the recruits, people to fill in, to 
fill gaps in casualties overseas. But they

41:56.043 --> 42:07.354
decided they'd better send me off there to 
something after a year or so, and I went to 30th

41:56.043 --> 42:07.354
Division. And they were training, getting ready 
to go overseas, to Oklahoma, Tennessee. And I was

42:14.120 --> 42:19.004
with them there, and then they sent us up, finished 
that, they sent us up to Indianapolis. And we did a

42:20.166 --> 42:24.970
little more work over there, and then they sent 
them overseas. And here I was about 52, and there

42:25.152 --> 42:28.475
was a cutoff. No, can't go. And so I went, I said, 
I've been in the Army now for a good many months, and

42:30.617 --> 42:47.534
I'm just drawing colonel's pay and doing 
something my captain can do, inspect a mess or

42:30.617 --> 42:47.534
something like that, or do other things. And I 
didn't come in the Army to do that kind of stuff, and

42:48.135 --> 42:51.799
I won't go home. And I've got a job back at A&M 
College. And they turned me down. They did? Yeah.

42:58.086 --> 43:03.031
And so they offered me a place to go to West Point. 
They said, you go up there and be a teacher at West

43:03.272 --> 43:05.594
Point. I said, well, I'm not the type. I'm a field 
soldier. I'm not the type that has a press blouse

43:09.078 --> 43:14.404
every week and shiny. And I just don't fit in to go to 
West Point. I'm way beyond that in the Army. the way

43:22.561 --> 43:27.426
I, what I think that an army man at my age should be 
doing. And finally, finally I just wrote him

43:28.147 --> 43:45.666
another letter and I said, now listen,

43:28.147 --> 43:45.666
I'm going to, I'm,

43:28.147 --> 43:45.666
thank you honey. I'm going to really expose you if 
you don't let me go. Because you just are making me

43:50.594 --> 43:58.185
do something that is degrading as far as a colonel 
is supposed to be doing. And you're paying me for

43:58.606 --> 44:01.970
doing something I'm not earning the money for. Now 
you better just let me loose now." And they let me

44:05.856 --> 44:06.717
go. Oh my goodness. I came on back to A&M College and 
fitted right in and went on just like I'd never

44:08.980 --> 44:13.666
been. As the track coach? Yeah. Well um I 
appreciate this interview. Well now this is not

44:20.798 --> 44:23.761
much about the City of College Station. Well if you 
I if you have other things is there some more that we

44:23.862 --> 44:30.891
can talk about that that you remember? There's I uh 
I don't I don't know I don't know of anything I don't

44:31.371 --> 44:47.192
know of anything the the mayor In those days, well,

44:47.425 --> 44:58.822
just like I said, if there was a polecat around, 
they'd call the city office. Well, I'd go get my

44:58.862 --> 45:00.464
gun. If there was a mad dog out, well, I'd go get my 
gun.

45:11.692 --> 45:13.354
What if there was an accident? Well, just things 
like that. What if there was some kind of accident?

45:17.560 --> 45:19.182
What if there was an accident? An accident? There 
was an accident where the mayor ahead of me was

45:21.085 --> 45:25.651
killed in an automobile accident. Oh, Mr. Benny? 
Huh? Mr. Benny? Yes. He was the first mayor. And he

45:33.501 --> 45:37.427
was mayor for only a certain number of months. And 
when he was killed in an automobile accident. And

45:41.206 --> 45:49.073
then they didn't have any mayor until that time.
