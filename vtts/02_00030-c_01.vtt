WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:06.697
The dean of students.

00:07.017 --> 00:08.700
Did you hire Austin Curley? Yeah, worked very 
close with Austin Curley when he was in the basic

00:09.482 --> 00:13.809
division. And did basic division report to you? 
No, it reported to, I believe, the restaurant

00:17.355 --> 00:27.051
office or somebody in the academic structure. 
They were in the Aggieland Inn when I would work

00:28.415 --> 00:37.409
with them because they helped us with a lot of 
students. We're talking about major decisions

00:37.429 --> 00:39.412
while ago. As you think back, can you think of any 
decisions which, now that we have clear

00:40.093 --> 00:49.307
hindsight, should have been decided the other 
way? I don't have any specific one to ask you about.

00:53.896 --> 01:10.403
No, I think this thing we read about yesterday 
about the manners in the dining hall in Duncan

00:53.896 --> 01:10.403
means a lot because a freshman doesn't have the 
same privilege to eat as a sophomore in the dining

00:53.896 --> 01:10.403
hall that I have observed. I've only been there a 
few times, Sul Ross Day, my class has a Sul Ross

01:10.433 --> 01:21.108
student and a PES student, and you can just see a 
little of it. And if they can do what the battalion

01:21.208 --> 01:31.463
said they were planning to do, I think that's a big 
step. And I think the President Commandant we have

01:31.443 --> 01:42.624
is as good a person for the job as I've seen since 
I've been here. I agree with you. Let's see, do you

01:44.728 --> 01:49.437
have any Rudder stories you can share, present 
Rudder? One while ago was a good example. No.

01:54.005 --> 01:59.633
That's the best story I can tell, and he said, you 
and I will be on the same side. I wish you were still

01:59.673 --> 02:01.996
back at the dining hall. Were you aware of his 
health declining not long before his death? I was

02:08.866 --> 02:10.468
not. Were you aware that he was in fragile health? 
Well, in a way, I could see a change in his health.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.314
activities and everything. He was a pretty heavy 
person to start with. I

02:23.678 --> 02:35.551
was shocked when I heard that he had died. It was a 
shock. One month before his 60th birthday. It cost

02:40.296 --> 02:45.342
him his teacher's retirement, didn't it? Well, 
see, they've revised it now, but he didn't qualify

02:45.693 --> 02:54.543
for veterans anything, nor did Mrs. Rutter. And 
Tiger Teague couldn't get an exception made for

02:55.844 --> 02:59.368
him. All right, then, did you have any work with 
Jack Williams? Yes. Well, the best story I can tell

03:04.794 --> 03:10.300
on Jack Williams was the first day he was in his 
office. You might have heard the People at the

03:13.486 --> 03:17.958
power plant were blowing the whistle at 8, 12, 1, 
and 5. Have you heard that story? Go ahead. And they

03:21.181 --> 03:27.146
blew it at 8 o'clock, and he called his secretary 
and said, what's that whistle blowing me? He got a

03:27.847 --> 03:29.068
fire somewhere? He said, no, that's the power 
plant. Be at work at 8, lunch at 12, back to work at 1,

03:33.852 --> 03:39.497
and 5, go home. He said, call the superintendent of 
the power plant and give him this message from me,

03:40.699 --> 03:51.188
that this is an educational institution and not a 
factory. And he just cut the cord on the whistle

03:51.168 --> 03:55.514
from now on. That's where you heard it? That's 
pretty close to what I heard. Well, that's the way I

04:00.141 --> 04:03.345
heard it. Did you have any other interactions with 
him? Oh, no, other than just here and there. He was a

04:12.894 --> 04:20.547
good person and a good administrator, and I think 
he went to medical school in Houston when he left

04:12.894 --> 04:20.547
here, didn't he? Yes, sir. That's right. Yes, sir. 
You might let her add her two cents worth. We had

04:28.040 --> 04:34.490
these houses on the campus, and Blue Courts was the 
only place in College Station where you could get a

04:28.040 --> 04:34.490
room. They were only close to East Gate, close to 
where that service station is now. And we knew a lot

04:40.599 --> 04:49.272
of students, and for the various reasons, and some 
disciplinary and some social. And there wasn't

04:49.252 --> 04:59.127
many weekends during the spring football 
weekends that she didn't take care of. Well,

04:59.208 --> 05:05.177
Wendy, the way this came up, the boys would walk 
through. See, we had a long driveway that went

05:05.277 --> 05:08.182
around to our backyard. Well, the students would 
just walk through our yard. Well, then we didn't

05:10.185 --> 05:11.206
care. Well, our house is at 414 Throckmorton. It's 
about close to where the... east corner of the

05:16.775 --> 05:23.085
parking garage is now and people walk through all 
the time. And we got to know a lot of those kids.

05:24.808 --> 05:26.150
They'd play with Bill and Peggy Jane. They were 
little tiny kids and they'd play with the kids and

05:26.170 --> 05:38.209
talk and we got to know them pretty good and they 
said after we got to know them pretty good They

05:38.189 --> 05:41.453
said, do you ever let... You want to start all over? 
No, no, we'll catch it. We'll catch it. Said, do you

05:44.016 --> 05:51.765
ever think about letting... Would you consider 
letting our girlfriends, when they come, stay at

05:44.016 --> 05:51.765
our house? Well, of course, I'm young, and I don't 
think about all of this and a beach. It didn't

05:55.730 --> 05:56.771
bother me at all. And, Lord, in mercy, we got to 
where we'd, nearly every weekend, for the ball

05:56.812 --> 06:06.323
game, we had one or two boys that had their 
girlfriends

06:09.087 --> 06:10.529
And did you ever charge them? Never a penny. It was 
always free? Not one penny. We just enjoyed it and

06:12.732 --> 06:15.736
never did even think about charging them. Did you 
ever have any problems? Never, never. They were

06:18.400 --> 06:19.962
always nice and pleasant? Uh-uh, never, never. 
And they never did abuse anything. Tell them if

06:23.027 --> 06:31.298
they wanted to get something, you know, a cold 
drink or something like that, the icebox would be,

06:23.027 --> 06:31.298
well, I mean, they'd be welcome to go there. And 
they would. Sometimes they'd come in at night and

06:33.501 --> 06:38.368
come on to the kitchen and... get something to 
drink out of the refrigerator, and they'd talk and

06:38.922 --> 06:43.789
laugh and have a good time. But we enjoyed them 
because they enjoyed the kids. And it was a lot of

06:47.294 --> 06:48.676
fun. It was just good. All right. And your kids, 
where did they play when they were little? They

06:54.625 --> 06:58.231
played all over the yard, and that's what made it 
nice. These fellows would walk through, and

06:58.251 --> 07:02.657
they'd talk with them and play with them. Guy and 
all was a big stop in their life. to go to movies.

07:09.396 --> 07:17.264
He'd be working basketball games or something 
like that and I could walk out of the backyard and

07:09.396 --> 07:17.264
right across, you know, we were so close. And there 
were some other faculty staff kids also in that

07:17.905 --> 07:22.990
same group of houses. Yeah, Joe Davis, Colonel 
Davis, do you remember him? Joe and Marie Davis

07:26.634 --> 07:28.616
lived on the corner. And Dr. R.D. Lewis, they 
didn't have any small children. And then on the

07:33.361 --> 07:39.508
other side of us, here was our house, here was 
Davis, and here was... D.W. Williams. And then

07:39.909 --> 07:42.152
D.W. Williams was on this side. Henderson 
Shuffler was in the next. Henderson Shuffler was

07:45.015 --> 07:50.882
in the two-story, then the Harringtons, you know, 
the big pretty house where Malin lives now. But

07:51.543 --> 07:55.087
Madge Williams was my mentor. I tell you, when we 
moved there, she knew all about the campus and all

07:55.167 --> 08:01.495
the people and everything. And she advised me on so 
many things there. I was just a little young woman

08:04.191 --> 08:07.156
with these two little tiny kids. And she just took 
me under her wing and told me what to do and what not

08:07.797 --> 08:13.024
to do and everything. It was just heaven on earth. 
It really was. I remember on the A&M Council, Jack,

08:16.208 --> 08:22.497
what is it, Jack Woods? Oh yeah, Jack Woods. Jack 
Woods that had his dates. in our home on a few

08:28.373 --> 08:31.537
occasions. It's on the council now. And he always 
wants to know if she's coming to the council

08:33.079 --> 08:37.465
meeting. But it was fun. Do you remember when the 
students marched on Dr. Gilchrist's house? I was

08:44.514 --> 08:50.362
sitting on the edge of the porch on the west end. 
Describe that, that whole event. Well, I heard it

08:53.247 --> 08:59.302
was going to happen and I knew I couldn't do 
anything to stop it. Wasn't anybody can stop it. So

09:01.648 --> 09:03.072
I was there. What were they disturbed about? They 
just wanted to make some of their own rules. But

09:10.331 --> 09:12.353
wasn't hazing one of the... I think hazing was one 
of the things that they were concerned about, and

09:12.613 --> 09:33.615
there might have been a number of other 
conditions, so they got together and agreed that

09:12.613 --> 09:33.615
everybody was going to turn in their promotion 
brass from

09:12.613 --> 09:33.615
one button to cadet term. And so I got a little, and I 
think I notified somebody else that it was going to

09:34.608 --> 09:41.517
happen. Anyway, I was sitting on the edge of the 
porch, and they come in, somebody knocked on the

09:42.078 --> 09:57.358
door, and Mr. Gilchrist came out, and so they told 
him that they were not satisfied with the way

09:58.165 --> 10:04.615
things are being run in the cadet corps, and maybe 
they needed different commissioned officers.

10:05.776 --> 10:13.548
And here's all of our cadet brass in this helmet 
line. And he said, will you accept it? He said, I'll

10:15.991 --> 10:18.275
accept it with regrets. But if that's the way you 
feel, we're going to run the school. And they had a

10:24.862 --> 10:33.069
big old lieutenant colonel that was assistant 
commandant named McLehaney, if I remember the

10:24.862 --> 10:33.069
name right. And he and his committee interviewed 
every one of them over a period of several weeks to

10:34.170 --> 10:44.840
see who they were going to put back. And in about 
three weeks, they had it rolling again. But I

10:49.524 --> 10:54.548
accept your resignation with regret.

10:55.523 --> 10:59.408
When it was all over, they knew who was still in 
charge, didn't they? That's right. That's right.

11:01.491 --> 11:11.263
McLehaney got that over to a lot of them during this 
interview of whether or not you want your job back

11:01.491 --> 11:11.263
or some other job. They made some promotions that 
they were good. Was Dr. Gilchrist ever, during

11:16.951 --> 11:20.215
that, criticized? by the fact that he was a 
University of Texas graduate? Not that I knew of. I

11:24.763 --> 11:31.933
think when he said, accept this with regret, I 
think it gained him a lot of momentum. Well, and his

11:32.694 --> 11:36.780
wife, Vesta Gilchrist, was such a – did you ever 
know her? No, ma'am. Well, she was a lady, and she

11:37.481 --> 11:40.245
was so loved. Well, let me tell – you can tell it – a 
story about Madge Williams and Peggy and the

11:49.439 --> 11:51.181
premium rose that she broke. Well, you want to tell 
it here? Yes, sure. D.W. and Madge Williams lived

11:54.765 --> 11:57.087
next door to us. A great member of the fire club or 
whatever. I'm young, and she just taught me so much

12:01.852 --> 12:05.857
and what to expect and blah, blah, blah. Well, 
Madge had this beautiful rose garden out in the

12:06.257 --> 12:15.227
back of her place, and the roses were huge. One 
certain one that she was saving for a show. She was

12:18.192 --> 12:20.495
watching for her garden club group. And one day 
Peggy Jane, our little girl, about five or six

12:21.115 --> 12:26.942
years old, came running in and says, Mama, look, 
look, look, look. And the minute I saw it, see, I

12:27.402 --> 12:31.767
knew it was Madge's rose. Oh, I liked it. Died. And I 
took her hand and took her over there. And I didn't

12:36.332 --> 12:38.275
know what Madge was going to say. You know, I just 
didn't know. I knew she was going to be

12:39.876 --> 12:41.498
heartbroken. And she just got in on the ground and 
hugged Peggy Jane and told me not to worry. And

12:48.005 --> 12:52.049
remember, her kids were grown and that she had gone 
through the same thing. One of them's a doctor. The

12:53.811 --> 12:55.072
boy's son's a doctor. I think that's right. 
Anyhow, that was the end of that. But I never, I

12:57.694 --> 13:02.279
guess that's where... And she told you not to 
reprimand her anymore? Yeah, I said, don't you go

13:02.299 --> 13:03.941
home and spank her. She said, I had, my little ones 
are grown and I know what you, how you feel. But I

13:08.585 --> 13:09.586
never will forget that. But she was the dearest 
lady that ever lived. And Eleanor and Henderson

13:12.717 --> 13:15.565
Shuffler in the two-story house. Did you ever know 
them? Only after he got to San Antonio. Well, they

13:19.756 --> 13:21.501
were lovely people. They were just lovely. 
Because I know that the Institute of Texan

13:22.865 --> 13:28.701
Cultures, as we now call it, that was his idea. that 
he was dreaming of doing it here, but he couldn't

13:29.137 --> 13:35.223
get it done. But over there he was. And you know 
they're both dead now? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. And

13:40.128 --> 13:40.568
R.D. Lewis is on the other side of us, and they were 
lovely people. They were older people, but they

13:43.792 --> 13:46.134
were very nice. They had a little apartment in 
their backyard about a half the size of this room, a

13:46.214 --> 13:55.223
random ass, and Darryl Hooper lived in it during 
his track days. Darryl? Yeah, Darryl Hooper. And I

13:58.212 --> 14:03.319
was the secretary, as I mentioned the other day, of 
that Aspirations Committee. Yes. And Dr. Lewis

14:04.040 --> 14:07.684
was one of the key members of that committee. Oh 
really? Oh, he was really good. He had good A&M

14:10.388 --> 14:13.612
experience, but he also had experience 
elsewhere. Right. So that he could give us a broad

14:14.233 --> 14:17.337
perspective. And because of his work with the 
Experiment Station, people would listen to it.

14:25.069 --> 14:30.517
Let me throw in on this an anecdote about that march 
on the President's House. I collect picture

14:31.338 --> 14:35.445
postcards from towns where we've lived. And up in 
Missouri, I found a card from College Station and a

14:36.867 --> 14:42.315
picture of Guyon Hall. And I looked at it and it was 
postmarked at that time Here's what it said and is

14:50.913 --> 14:58.281
written to a lady in Mount Pleasant, Texas dear 
mother Made it back home. Okay The ice and snow

14:58.382 --> 15:02.066
ended about Tyler. We drove slow all the way to 
Palestine We're back here. I think it's going to be

15:07.132 --> 15:12.618
okay We marched on the president's house last 
night, buddy. That was his roommate. I learned

15:13.619 --> 15:14.440
later and buddy we thought was going to be a big 
trouble but i think maybe we'll both be able to stay

15:14.808 --> 15:38.757
in school and he signed his last name all right i 
then thought hmm i remember a friend in the

15:14.808 --> 15:38.757
presbyterian church in el paso from mount 
pleasant with that first name so we were visiting

15:14.808 --> 15:38.757
it back in el paso about three months later They got 
to church before we did that morning. I had the

15:42.130 --> 15:49.759
usher pass a note to him saying, I'll meet you out in 
the vestibule. Afterward, I got something for

15:50.560 --> 15:52.022
you. And so I looked back and he got the note and he 
said, you know, see you. And so I woke up to him and I

15:56.528 --> 15:59.732
said, let me read you a postcard. And I said, did 
your mother ever live at such and such an address?

16:04.518 --> 16:05.038
Well, yeah. And I said, let me read you a postcard. 
And I read it to him and he said, where'd you get

16:07.281 --> 16:09.604
that? And he said that when they participated in 
the march, they both thought they were going to be

16:10.428 --> 16:16.376
kicked out of school. Because he said, we were 
scared that

16:17.177 --> 16:29.053
President Gilchrist, we knew he was in charge, and 
we were scared that he was going to kick us all out.

16:29.573 --> 16:35.581
And he was the parent of the boy that wrote the card. 
He's the one who wrote it. And so I gave him the card.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.047
I said, here, you've got... And he said, oh, what a 
keepsake, what a keepsake. Now, as you lived on—

16:44.663 --> 16:50.191
You ought to give him a Xerox of it and put that in the 
archives. Now, as you all lived on the campus, your

16:51.593 --> 16:58.563
children's closest playmates were there in the 
neighborhood. Right there. What did you call

16:59.565 --> 17:00.827
that? You didn't call that faculty housing. What 
did you call that little neighborhood? Well, we

17:05.288 --> 17:07.551
just didn't call it anything. Well, we lived in two 
different houses. The first house they moved us

17:09.873 --> 17:13.557
out of is about where Mr. Rudder's monument is now 
in the mold of the Bible. Oh, that would have been

17:16.040 --> 17:17.162
worth telling that. We were just there about a 
mile. Because there was houses all the way around

17:18.984 --> 17:22.288
that block. So when they started moving those out, 
they gave us one over in 414 Throckmorton, which

17:29.521 --> 17:31.784
pretty close to this military bonfire. Well, it 
was wonderful. Four bedrooms, two full baths, a

17:33.125 --> 17:43.277
great big screen porch, and that's why we had a 
separate dining room, you know, living room,

17:33.125 --> 17:43.277
dining room, and all that, and a great big old back 
porch that was . . . About this high off the floor. An

17:44.919 --> 17:46.661
old-fashioned house. Cold in the winter and hot in 
the summer. Now, what did it, do you remember what

17:48.444 --> 17:50.226
the rent was? Nineteen dollars a month, and all 
utilities paid, but no air conditioning. Let's

17:55.492 --> 17:58.197
see, and did they mow the grass? Well, kids can't 
fit trunks down. Oh, okay. No, we, don't you know,

18:01.764 --> 18:09.119
Bill had to mow, our son was old enough, he got to 
where he had to mow, and you mowed some. But no, they

18:09.660 --> 18:12.746
didn't take care of the yard, but everything was 
lovely. It was just great living there. We've got

18:14.628 --> 18:17.031
about 15 more minutes. That's what Dr. Ed 
Williams, who was my department head, told old

18:17.272 --> 18:25.503
Rollins when he told him where he was. He said they 
gave him a campus on the house, $19 and $300 a month.

18:30.530 --> 18:41.766
And I stayed with him 24 years and then moved to the 
mail room, and I'm not sorry yet because it was a

18:30.530 --> 18:41.766
good time. operational type of thing, 
management. Well he's got some things he wants to

18:45.551 --> 18:47.413
ask you about. No, no. And the faculty mail manager 
now worked as me as a student mail sorter. Oh, how

18:56.505 --> 18:56.985
good. Four years as a business major and Daddy had 
the Pearl beer distributorship in this county.

19:10.531 --> 19:15.162
Johnny, anyway, what his last name was. He went to 
work for his dad when they got out of school. And

19:19.526 --> 19:21.848
somebody bought the distributorship. And he 
called me one day and said, I need to talk to you. So

19:27.574 --> 19:30.236
he come in and spent about three hours one 
afternoon. He said, now that's my problem. I don't

19:34.400 --> 19:36.162
have a job and don't know where to go. And I said, you 
did a good job sorting mail. You knew the

19:40.806 --> 19:42.448
departments. You didn't ride a truck. You didn't 
know where all of them were. But you knew those

19:46.424 --> 19:49.188
cages as well as anybody. And you have a degree in 
business management. And if you like the mail, you

19:53.916 --> 20:03.492
go down there and tell them you want a part-time job 
by the hour, any time of the day, any time of the

19:53.916 --> 20:03.492
week, a day or night. get your foot in the door, and 
first time a vacancy comes up for the manager of the

20:03.472 --> 20:16.891
mail service, you'll have not only a foot in the 
door, you'll have your head in, too. And in two

20:18.072 --> 20:22.138
years, after going through the route of the 
different areas and learning that. He's got the

20:28.204 --> 20:33.430
job, doing a good job, and his class is big now as it 
was then. And we kept postage against his

20:34.511 --> 20:40.017
apartments and a notebook. And now, if history has 
a stack of letters that wants to run through the

20:40.037 --> 20:48.666
meter, they take the meter reading, put it in a 
computer, and take it when it comes out and the

20:48.646 --> 20:52.952
bills will come out automatically at the end of the 
month. It took a full-time person to keep books on

20:53.073 --> 20:57.980
it and get our money back. What have we left out that 
we should have included? Are there some topics

21:01.145 --> 21:05.411
that you remember that we should have included? 
Well, I'll have to think right quick. Well, if we,

21:09.497 --> 21:17.910
when we give you back the first draft, feel free to 
add, subtract, edit, I've got three more

21:18.970 --> 21:26.982
questions I want to ask,

21:18.970 --> 21:26.982
and these can get serious. As you look back on it, 
what difference did it make in your life that you

21:28.064 --> 21:35.815
went to Texas A&M? Well, I know how much it's meant 
to me, but

21:44.418 --> 21:48.563
farming or ranching or being a carpenter. I don't 
know. I couldn't compare it because I was well

21:50.566 --> 22:04.823
prepared both athletically and occupational 
wise and I wouldn't take anything from a five years

22:04.803 --> 22:11.912
of coaching experience and Class A basketball. 
And I just couldn't compare it with anything else

22:11.932 --> 22:17.659
except what I see somebody else doing. But my 
commission, as I mentioned in some other article,

22:19.221 --> 22:33.358
my commission and my association with athletics 
has made it a very good life for both of us. Alright,

22:34.435 --> 22:40.948
let's make believe somebody gives you a check for a 
million dollars, and there's only one

22:34.435 --> 22:40.948
requirement. You've got to pass it on to Texas A&M, 
but you get to decide what's going to be done with

22:41.990 --> 22:48.583
it. What would you tell A&M to do with that gift? 
Well, if it was, no, it would be a restricted gift.

22:55.968 --> 22:57.870
Oh, but you decide what the restrictions are. 
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The only way that it

22:58.692 --> 23:08.526
goes to scholarships for underprivileged high 
school people, because we have a lot of high school

22:58.692 --> 23:08.526
people that don't go to college, that don't have 
the funds. Just that one place. And that's what the

23:17.302 --> 23:21.249
half that A&M gets out of our trust. Ms. Lusk says, 
we want half of it and we'll take care of the whole

23:22.511 --> 23:26.759
thing. I tried two or three banks and nobody could 
help me. She said, all we want is half of it. I said,

23:32.387 --> 23:36.592
well, do we have any input on where it goes? She 
said, anything is authorized across the street.

23:41.178 --> 23:53.112
So we put one Selroth scholarship for this Navy 
cadet, World War I veteran, who helped sweep the

23:41.178 --> 23:53.112
North Sea of all the German mines. And my brother, 
who was an air science major, got a three-year

23:54.294 --> 23:59.640
scholarship. for a day of science major, and they 
select him when he was a freshman. And the rest of it

24:06.008 --> 24:08.011
was opportunity awards. So I hope that answers 
your question. Because we've just got lots of kids

24:11.736 --> 24:14.099
that don't have it. The Brattis County 
Engineering Club is doing a good job putting a lot

24:14.799 --> 24:25.233
of kids through school with scholarships that has 
come in to be in the last 10 years. Last question.

24:27.565 --> 24:35.099
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas 
A&M?

24:35.119 --> 24:46.080
Well, I'd have to say it's first place, except my 
church.

24:47.917 --> 25:00.161
As soon as we got here, as soon as we got here, and 
especially after we retired, we got involved in

24:47.917 --> 25:00.161
all athletics, especially women's athletics. 
And we were charter members and helped organize

25:00.181 --> 25:03.107
the Lady Aggie Maroon Club, of which we are the 
second lifetime member. And we'd go to basketball

25:11.449 --> 25:15.635
games, see if people could not hit a free throw. So 
we endowed for 20 years the highest proficiency

25:16.637 --> 25:30.478
free throw shooter under certain conditions, so 
many games and so many shots. as an award it would

25:30.458 --> 25:32.521
give. And I got only three women and three men up 
yonder, and they got three behind on both the

25:33.363 --> 25:41.556
others. And they've all improved, and these 
coaches have been very, very fond of it. Good. And

25:49.043 --> 26:01.545
I've had Penny King working on two other wards that 
we're going to endow the softball and baseball on

25:49.043 --> 26:01.545
the man with the most RBI. you can't score if you've 
got the bases loaded if you can't get them in. And

26:09.629 --> 26:17.420
Penny King's been dragging her foot on that foot 
for a year, but she says she's going to get it done.

26:18.362 --> 26:23.068
So that's one of the things that we've added to it. 
And the rest of that is what I've done from

26:24.050 --> 26:31.060
militarily and
