00:02.630 --> 00:27.031
The dean of students. Did you hire Austin Curley? Yeah, worked very close with Austin Curley when he was in the basic division. And did basic division report to you? No, it reported to, I believe, the restaurant office or somebody in the academic structure.

00:28.415 --> 00:53.373
They were in the Aggieland Inn when I would work with them because they helped us with a lot of students. We're talking about major decisions while ago. As you think back, can you think of any decisions which, now that we have clear hindsight, should have been decided the other way? I don't have any specific one to ask you about.

00:53.896 --> 01:10.383
No, I think this thing we read about yesterday about the manners in the dining hall in Duncan means a lot because a freshman doesn't have the same privilege to eat as a sophomore in the dining hall that I have observed.

01:10.433 --> 01:31.443
I've only been there a few times, Sul Ross Day, my class has a Sul Ross student and a PES student, and you can just see a little of it. And if they can do what the battalion said they were planning to do, I think that's a big step.

01:31.443 --> 01:52.823
And I think the President Commandant we have is as good a person for the job as I've seen since I've been here. I agree with you. Let's see, do you have any Rudder stories you can share, present Rudder? One while ago was a good example. No.

01:54.005 --> 02:17.798
That's the best story I can tell, and he said, you and I will be on the same side. I wish you were still back at the dining hall. Were you aware of his health declining not long before his death? I was not. Were you aware that he was in fragile health? Well, in a way, I could see a change in his health.

02:18.372 --> 02:45.322
activities and everything. He was a pretty heavy person to start with. I was shocked when I heard that he had died. It was a shock. One month before his 60th birthday. It cost him his teacher's retirement, didn't it?

02:45.693 --> 03:13.283
Well, see, they've revised it now, but he didn't qualify for veterans anything, nor did Mrs. Rutter. And Tiger Teague couldn't get an exception made for him. All right, then, did you have any work with Jack Williams? Yes. Well, the best story I can tell on Jack Williams was the first day he was in his office. You might have heard the

03:13.486 --> 03:19.730
People at the power plant were blowing the whistle at 8, 12, 1, and 5. Have you heard that story? Go ahead.

03:21.181 --> 03:51.168
And they blew it at 8 o'clock, and he called his secretary and said, what's that whistle blowing me? He got a fire somewhere? He said, no, that's the power plant. Be at work at 8, lunch at 12, back to work at 1, and 5, go home. He said, call the superintendent of the power plant and give him this message from me, that this is an educational institution and not a factory.

03:51.168 --> 04:09.494
And he just cut the cord on the whistle from now on. That's where you heard it? That's pretty close to what I heard. Well, that's the way I heard it. Did you have any other interactions with him?

04:09.629 --> 04:28.040
Oh, no, other than just here and there. He was a good person and a good administrator, and I think he went to medical school in Houston when he left here, didn't he? Yes, sir. That's right. Yes, sir. You might let her add her two cents worth. We had

04:28.040 --> 04:49.252
these houses on the campus, and Blue Courts was the only place in College Station where you could get a room. They were only close to East Gate, close to where that service station is now. And we knew a lot of students, and for the various reasons, and some disciplinary and some social.

04:49.252 --> 05:16.775
And there wasn't many weekends during the spring football weekends that she didn't take care of. Well, Wendy, the way this came up, the boys would walk through. See, we had a long driveway that went around to our backyard. Well, the students would just walk through our yard. Well, then we didn't care. Well, our house is at 414 Throckmorton. It's about close to where the...

05:16.775 --> 05:38.189
east corner of the parking garage is now and people walk through all the time. And we got to know a lot of those kids. They'd play with Bill and Peggy Jane. They were little tiny kids and they'd play with the kids and talk and we got to know them pretty good and they said after we got to know them pretty good

05:38.189 --> 06:06.303
They said, do you ever let... You want to start all over? No, no, we'll catch it. We'll catch it. Said, do you ever think about letting... Would you consider letting our girlfriends, when they come, stay at our house? Well, of course, I'm young, and I don't think about all of this and a beach. It didn't bother me at all. And, Lord, in mercy, we got to where we'd, nearly every weekend, for the ball game, we had one or two boys that had their girlfriends

06:09.087 --> 06:38.348
And did you ever charge them? Never a penny. It was always free? Not one penny. We just enjoyed it and never did even think about charging them. Did you ever have any problems? Never, never. They were always nice and pleasant? Uh-uh, never, never. And they never did abuse anything. Tell them if they wanted to get something, you know, a cold drink or something like that, the icebox would be, well, I mean, they'd be welcome to go there. And they would. Sometimes they'd come in at night and come on to the kitchen and...

06:38.922 --> 07:06.563
get something to drink out of the refrigerator, and they'd talk and laugh and have a good time. But we enjoyed them because they enjoyed the kids. And it was a lot of fun. It was just good. All right. And your kids, where did they play when they were little? They played all over the yard, and that's what made it nice. These fellows would walk through, and they'd talk with them and play with them. Guy and all was a big stop in their life.

07:06.833 --> 07:33.361
to go to movies. He'd be working basketball games or something like that and I could walk out of the backyard and right across, you know, we were so close. And there were some other faculty staff kids also in that same group of houses. Yeah, Joe Davis, Colonel Davis, do you remember him? Joe and Marie Davis lived on the corner. And Dr. R.D. Lewis, they didn't have any small children.

07:33.361 --> 08:01.475
And then on the other side of us, here was our house, here was Davis, and here was... D.W. Williams. And then D.W. Williams was on this side. Henderson Shuffler was in the next. Henderson Shuffler was in the two-story, then the Harringtons, you know, the big pretty house where Malin lives now. But Madge Williams was my mentor. I tell you, when we moved there, she knew all about the campus and all the people and everything.

08:01.728 --> 08:27.985
And she advised me on so many things there. I was just a little young woman with these two little tiny kids. And she just took me under her wing and told me what to do and what not to do and everything. It was just heaven on earth. It really was. I remember on the A&M Council, Jack, what is it, Jack Woods? Oh yeah, Jack Woods. Jack Woods that had his dates.

08:28.373 --> 08:52.825
in our home on a few occasions. It's on the council now. And he always wants to know if she's coming to the council meeting. But it was fun. Do you remember when the students marched on Dr. Gilchrist's house? I was sitting on the edge of the porch on the west end. Describe that, that whole event.

08:53.247 --> 09:04.756
Well, I heard it was going to happen and I knew I couldn't do anything to stop it. Wasn't anybody can stop it. So I was there. What were they disturbed about?

09:05.566 --> 09:33.595
They just wanted to make some of their own rules. But wasn't hazing one of the... I think hazing was one of the things that they were concerned about, and there might have been a number of other conditions, so they got together and agreed that everybody was going to turn in their promotion brass from one button to cadet term.

09:34.608 --> 09:57.338
And so I got a little, and I think I notified somebody else that it was going to happen. Anyway, I was sitting on the edge of the porch, and they come in, somebody knocked on the door, and Mr. Gilchrist came out, and so they told him that they were not satisfied with

09:58.165 --> 10:23.242
the way things are being run in the cadet corps, and maybe they needed different commissioned officers. And here's all of our cadet brass in this helmet line. And he said, will you accept it? He said, I'll accept it with regrets. But if that's the way you feel, we're going to run the school.

10:24.862 --> 10:54.528
And they had a big old lieutenant colonel that was assistant commandant named McLehaney, if I remember the name right. And he and his committee interviewed every one of them over a period of several weeks to see who they were going to put back. And in about three weeks, they had it rolling again. But I accept your resignation with regret.

10:55.523 --> 11:20.195
When it was all over, they knew who was still in charge, didn't they? That's right. That's right. McLehaney got that over to a lot of them during this interview of whether or not you want your job back or some other job. They made some promotions that they were good. Was Dr. Gilchrist ever, during that, criticized?

11:20.397 --> 11:47.515
by the fact that he was a University of Texas graduate? Not that I knew of. I think when he said, accept this with regret, I think it gained him a lot of momentum. Well, and his wife, Vesta Gilchrist, was such a – did you ever know her? No, ma'am. Well, she was a lady, and she was so loved. Well, let me tell – you can tell it – a story about Madge Williams and Peggy and the

11:49.439 --> 12:15.207
premium rose that she broke. Well, you want to tell it here? Yes, sure. D.W. and Madge Williams lived next door to us. A great member of the fire club or whatever. I'm young, and she just taught me so much and what to expect and blah, blah, blah. Well, Madge had this beautiful rose garden out in the back of her place, and the roses were huge.

12:15.629 --> 12:43.000
One certain one that she was saving for a show. She was watching for her garden club group. And one day Peggy Jane, our little girl, about five or six years old, came running in and says, Mama, look, look, look, look. And the minute I saw it, see, I knew it was Madge's rose. Oh, I liked it. Died. And I took her hand and took her over there. And I didn't know what Madge was going to say. You know, I just didn't know. I knew she was going to be heartbroken. And she just

12:43.220 --> 13:12.329
got in on the ground and hugged Peggy Jane and told me not to worry. And remember, her kids were grown and that she had gone through the same thing. One of them's a doctor. The boy's son's a doctor. I think that's right. Anyhow, that was the end of that. But I never, I guess that's where... And she told you not to reprimand her anymore? Yeah, I said, don't you go home and spank her. She said, I had, my little ones are grown and I know what you, how you feel. But I never will forget that. But she was the dearest lady that ever lived.

13:12.717 --> 13:28.681
And Eleanor and Henderson Shuffler in the two-story house. Did you ever know them? Only after he got to San Antonio. Well, they were lovely people. They were just lovely. Because I know that the Institute of Texan Cultures, as we now call it, that was his idea.

13:29.137 --> 13:57.385
that he was dreaming of doing it here, but he couldn't get it done. But over there he was. And you know they're both dead now? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. And R.D. Lewis is on the other side of us, and they were lovely people. They were older people, but they were very nice. They had a little apartment in their backyard about a half the size of this room, a random ass, and Darryl Hooper lived in it during his track days. Darryl? Yeah, Darryl Hooper.

13:58.212 --> 14:22.023
And I was the secretary, as I mentioned the other day, of that Aspirations Committee. Yes. And Dr. Lewis was one of the key members of that committee. Oh really? Oh, he was really good. He had good A&M experience, but he also had experience elsewhere. Right. So that he could give us a broad perspective. And because of his work with the Experiment Station,

14:22.445 --> 14:50.187
people would listen to it. Let me throw in on this an anecdote about that march on the President's House. I collect picture postcards from towns where we've lived. And up in Missouri, I found a card from College Station and a picture of Guyon Hall. And I looked at it and it was postmarked at that time

14:50.913 --> 15:14.420
Here's what it said and is written to a lady in Mount Pleasant, Texas dear mother Made it back home. Okay The ice and snow ended about Tyler. We drove slow all the way to Palestine We're back here. I think it's going to be okay We marched on the president's house last night, buddy. That was his roommate. I learned later and

15:14.808 --> 15:38.737
buddy we thought was going to be a big trouble but i think maybe we'll both be able to stay in school and he signed his last name all right i then thought hmm i remember a friend in the presbyterian church in el paso from mount pleasant with that first name so we were visiting it back in el paso about three months later

15:39.867 --> 16:09.584
They got to church before we did that morning. I had the usher pass a note to him saying, I'll meet you out in the vestibule. Afterward, I got something for you. And so I looked back and he got the note and he said, you know, see you. And so I woke up to him and I said, let me read you a postcard. And I said, did your mother ever live at such and such an address? Well, yeah. And I said, let me read you a postcard. And I read it to him and he said, where'd you get that?

16:10.428 --> 16:40.027
And he said that when they participated in the march, they both thought they were going to be kicked out of school. Because he said, we were scared that President Gilchrist, we knew he was in charge, and we were scared that he was going to kick us all out. And he was the parent of the boy that wrote the card. He's the one who wrote it. And so I gave him the card. I said, here, you've got...

16:40.617 --> 17:05.153
And he said, oh, what a keepsake, what a keepsake. Now, as you lived on— You ought to give him a Xerox of it and put that in the archives. Now, as you all lived on the campus, your children's closest playmates were there in the neighborhood. Right there. What did you call that? You didn't call that faculty housing. What did you call that little neighborhood?

17:05.288 --> 17:28.795
Well, we just didn't call it anything. Well, we lived in two different houses. The first house they moved us out of is about where Mr. Rudder's monument is now in the mold of the Bible. Oh, that would have been worth telling that. We were just there about a mile. Because there was houses all the way around that block. So when they started moving those out, they gave us one over in 414 Throckmorton, which

17:29.521 --> 17:55.492
pretty close to this military bonfire. Well, it was wonderful. Four bedrooms, two full baths, a great big screen porch, and that's why we had a separate dining room, you know, living room, dining room, and all that, and a great big old back porch that was . . . About this high off the floor. An old-fashioned house. Cold in the winter and hot in the summer. Now, what did it, do you remember what the rent was? Nineteen dollars a month, and all utilities paid, but no air conditioning.

17:55.492 --> 18:14.189
Let's see, and did they mow the grass? Well, kids can't fit trunks down. Oh, okay. No, we, don't you know, Bill had to mow, our son was old enough, he got to where he had to mow, and you mowed some. But no, they didn't take care of the yard, but everything was lovely. It was just great living there.

18:14.628 --> 18:41.746
We've got about 15 more minutes. That's what Dr. Ed Williams, who was my department head, told old Rollins when he told him where he was. He said they gave him a campus on the house, $19 and $300 a month. And I stayed with him 24 years and then moved to the mail room, and I'm not sorry yet because it was a good time.

18:41.746 --> 19:02.452
operational type of thing, management. Well he's got some things he wants to ask you about. No, no. And the faculty mail manager now worked as me as a student mail sorter. Oh, how good. Four years as a business major and

19:02.992 --> 19:15.142
Daddy had the Pearl beer distributorship in this county. Johnny, anyway, what his last name was.

19:15.682 --> 19:42.428
He went to work for his dad when they got out of school. And somebody bought the distributorship. And he called me one day and said, I need to talk to you. So he come in and spent about three hours one afternoon. He said, now that's my problem. I don't have a job and don't know where to go. And I said, you did a good job sorting mail. You knew the departments.

19:42.918 --> 20:03.472
You didn't ride a truck. You didn't know where all of them were. But you knew those cages as well as anybody. And you have a degree in business management. And if you like the mail, you go down there and tell them you want a part-time job by the hour, any time of the day, any time of the week, a day or night.

20:03.472 --> 20:22.118
get your foot in the door, and first time a vacancy comes up for the manager of the mail service, you'll have not only a foot in the door, you'll have your head in, too. And in two years, after going through the

20:22.118 --> 20:48.646
route of the different areas and learning that. He's got the job, doing a good job, and his class is big now as it was then. And we kept postage against his apartments and a notebook. And now, if history has a stack of letters that wants to run through the meter, they take the meter reading, put it in a computer,

20:48.646 --> 21:17.890
and take it when it comes out and the bills will come out automatically at the end of the month. It took a full-time person to keep books on it and get our money back. What have we left out that we should have included? Are there some topics that you remember that we should have included? Well, I'll have to think right quick. Well, if we, when we give you back the first draft, feel free to add, subtract, edit,

21:18.970 --> 21:42.325
I've got three more questions I want to ask, and these can get serious. As you look back on it, what difference did it make in your life that you went to Texas A&M? Well, I know how much it's meant to me, but

21:44.418 --> 22:04.803
farming or ranching or being a carpenter. I don't know. I couldn't compare it because I was well prepared both athletically and occupational wise and I wouldn't take anything from a

22:04.803 --> 22:33.338
five years of coaching experience and Class A basketball. And I just couldn't compare it with anything else except what I see somebody else doing. But my commission, as I mentioned in some other article, my commission and my association with athletics has made it a very good life for both of us.

22:34.435 --> 22:50.888
Alright, let's make believe somebody gives you a check for a million dollars, and there's only one requirement. You've got to pass it on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide what's going to be done with it. What would you tell A&M to do with that gift?

22:51.361 --> 23:08.506
Well, if it was, no, it would be a restricted gift. Oh, but you decide what the restrictions are. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The only way that it goes to scholarships for underprivileged high school people, because we have a lot of high school people

23:08.506 --> 23:30.325
that don't go to college, that don't have the funds. Just that one place. And that's what the half that A&M gets out of our trust. Ms. Lusk says, we want half of it and we'll take care of the whole thing. I tried two or three banks and nobody could help me.

23:30.325 --> 23:59.620
She said, all we want is half of it. I said, well, do we have any input on where it goes? She said, anything is authorized across the street. So we put one Selroth scholarship for this Navy cadet, World War I veteran, who helped sweep the North Sea of all the German mines. And my brother, who was an air science major, got a three-year scholarship.

23:59.620 --> 24:26.975
for a day of science major, and they select him when he was a freshman. And the rest of it was opportunity awards. So I hope that answers your question. Because we've just got lots of kids that don't have it. The Brattis County Engineering Club is doing a good job putting a lot of kids through school with scholarships that has come in to be in the last 10 years. Last question.

24:27.565 --> 24:46.060
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M? Well, I'd have to say it's first place, except my church.

24:47.917 --> 25:03.087
As soon as we got here, as soon as we got here, and especially after we retired, we got involved in all athletics, especially women's athletics. And we were charter members and helped organize the

25:03.897 --> 25:30.458
Lady Aggie Maroon Club, of which we are the second lifetime member. And we'd go to basketball games, see if people could not hit a free throw. So we endowed for 20 years the highest proficiency free throw shooter under certain conditions, so many games and so many shots.

25:30.458 --> 25:46.203
as an award it would give. And I got only three women and three men up yonder, and they got three behind on both the others. And they've all improved, and these coaches have

25:46.439 --> 26:01.525
been very, very fond of it. Good. And I've had Penny King working on two other wards that we're going to endow the softball and baseball on the man with the most RBI.

26:02.639 --> 26:31.040
you can't score if you've got the bases loaded if you can't get them in. And Penny King's been dragging her foot on that foot for a year, but she says she's going to get it done. So that's one of the things that we've added to it. And the rest of that is what I've done from militarily and
