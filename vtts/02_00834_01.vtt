00:04.469 --> 00:06.773
This is Tuesday, March 23, 1976. I'm Mark Burnett, 
and I'm working on an oral history project for Dr.

00:06.994 --> 00:15.570
Kimber's cultural geography class. I'm talking 
with Mr. Harry L. Kidd, Jr. Mr. Kidd is an associate

00:16.492 --> 00:27.473
professor of English and the assistant dean of the 
graduate college at Texas A&M University. Mr.

00:28.465 --> 00:33.092
Kidd, I guess we'll start out you telling us a 
little bit about your background. All right, I'll

00:33.492 --> 00:35.355
be happy to, Mr. Burnett. I'm of German, Welsh, and 
Italian stock. My grandfather on my mother's side

00:39.842 --> 00:49.236
was descended from one of the Hessian soldiers of 
the American Revolution who remained in the

00:39.842 --> 00:49.236
United States after the Revolution. My 
grandfather's name was J.W.W. Schuller, and he

00:52.580 --> 00:56.346
was a mountain circuit rider. in the southwestern 
part of the state of Virginia. He was a Methodist

00:59.942 --> 01:05.330
circuit rider, and he and his entire family were 
devoted Methodists. Two of his sons were

01:06.452 --> 01:20.494
Methodist preachers, and one was rather noted 
during the so-called Roaring Twenties as

01:06.452 --> 01:20.494
Fightin' Bob Shuler, who was a famous West Coast 
evangelist and who was constantly in the

01:06.452 --> 01:20.494
newspapers for his attacks. on sand and the devil, 
and I think also on Amy Semple McPherson, who was a

01:21.014 --> 01:27.640
rival evangelist lady at the time. My father's 
people were early settlers in Virginia. They were

01:32.764 --> 01:39.691
of Welsh stock, and they settled in the little town 
of Lovingston, Virginia, which is not far from

01:32.764 --> 01:39.691
Charlottesville. My grandfather Kidd, his name 
was Edward Kidd, was clerk of the court there in

01:39.711 --> 01:45.296
Lovingston for many years. My father was a law 
graduate of Washington Lee University in

01:46.557 --> 01:50.380
Virginia. One of his brothers was a VMI graduate, 
and the other was a University of Virginia

01:50.630 --> 01:56.036
graduate. And you can well imagine that there was a 
good old football rivalry up in that part of the

01:56.056 --> 02:00.661
woods. Sometimes it was said the kid boys couldn't 
stay in the same house with each other during the

02:01.442 --> 02:08.490
fall football season. I myself was born in a small 
mountain town in southwest Virginia, a little

02:08.510 --> 02:15.538
town called Lebanon, Virginia. It was the county 
seat of Russell County. My father at that time was a

02:18.085 --> 02:20.909
young lawyer. He was a partner in a very old law firm 
specializing in corporation law. Lebanon was, I

02:27.038 --> 02:30.162
thought, a very beautiful little town. I loved it 
very much. It was a mountain town completely

02:32.105 --> 02:47.046
surrounded by mountains on all sides with springs 
coming out of the sides of the mountains and all

02:32.105 --> 02:47.046
beautiful rhododendrons and flowers of all sorts 
on the sides of the mountain in the springs. And

02:47.482 --> 02:56.470
there were caves in virtually every small hill and 
mountain where little boys who liked a little

02:47.482 --> 02:56.470
adventure in danger could play. And there was some 
danger. But of course, our parents didn't find out

02:58.972 --> 03:04.738
that we'd been in some of these caves until we got 
home again and we had trouble. My family was

03:05.899 --> 03:12.064
composed of my father and mother, myself, and Ed 
Kidd, my younger brother. Ed was named after my

03:12.465 --> 03:15.227
grandfather, Edward Kidd. Ed now lives in Mahea, 
Texas. He is retired having had a serious illness a

03:19.948 --> 03:24.515
few years ago. I went to school in Lebanon. It was an 
interesting school. It was a small mountain

03:28.662 --> 03:34.331
school in which for the first few grades, several 
grades were taught in one room. I don't remember

03:34.351 --> 03:39.860
now all these years later too much about my early 
school experiences. I do remember that we had

03:40.501 --> 03:45.028
chapel every day and we had a very traditional, I 
suppose, conservative American-type chapel of

03:45.413 --> 03:53.923
the 20s in these small schools. We all filed in. In 
fact, we marched in the chapel. Everyone in the

03:57.287 --> 04:02.874
school marched in the chapel and took seats in the 
same places every morning. We had prayers led by

04:03.595 --> 04:08.320
the school superintendent, something that 
wouldn't be allowed now. And we sang various

04:09.241 --> 04:11.164
songs. I can remember such songs as America the 
Beautiful, when the corn is waving any deer, and

04:14.438 --> 04:19.225
other songs that all of us really enjoyed singing. 
Generally, either the school superintendent or

04:20.206 --> 04:26.095
some prominent person in town would give us a 
little inspirational talk. There would be

04:26.595 --> 04:31.342
announcements made about the work of the day, and 
then we'd all go back to our rooms and work. I

04:32.464 --> 04:34.106
enjoyed my school life there. It was pleasant. It 
was a small town. I had a number of good playmates.

04:39.514 --> 04:43.399
In the wintertime, snow was on the ground from 
about October until March. We could go up into the

04:43.885 --> 04:50.292
sides of the mountains and take our little flying 
arrow sleds and slide down the mountains. I well

04:50.432 --> 04:55.036
recall trying my sled out in an early autumn snow. 
And the snow was just fine for sledding, but there

04:55.177 --> 05:01.543
was a little brook at the bottom of the mountain 
that I'd forgot about. And I was just flying down

05:02.264 --> 05:06.889
the side of the hill and suddenly realized that 
there it was. And it had not frozen over, and there

05:06.909 --> 05:09.751
was nothing to do. I just stayed with the sled. sled 
and I went into about four feet of icy cold water,

05:11.611 --> 05:18.059
and that ended my sledding for the day. We had lots 
of fun in the summertime. My aunts and uncles who

05:21.463 --> 05:28.852
also lived around the town there had cherry trees 
and fruit trees of various kinds. I spent a good

05:28.992 --> 05:34.058
deal of time sitting up in cherry trees, making 
myself sick with cherries. In the fall and autumn,

05:34.098 --> 05:39.745
we had apple trees of various kinds in our own 
backyard. I well remember the cider making

05:40.332 --> 05:53.070
operations that we used to involve ourselves in 
and the way the bees and wasps would get drunk on the

05:40.332 --> 05:53.070
cider and crawl around and fall into the cider and 
have to be strained out. We had various things in

05:54.292 --> 05:57.536
the yard there. We had a garden, which I didn't care 
too much for because I had to do a little work in it

05:57.576 --> 06:03.184
that I didn't much want to do. I raised ducks and 
turkeys and rabbits and so forth, and there they

06:03.923 --> 06:14.313
were mainly pets, and I felt bad when we ate one, 
though I ate my share nevertheless. So all in all,

06:14.954 --> 06:21.920
life in this little mountain town was very 
pleasant for me and for my family and for all those

06:14.954 --> 06:21.920
people. I knew there it was a small and fairly 
prosperous town. It was not far from the coal mine

06:26.044 --> 06:29.728
area, but it wasn't a coal town. Basically, it was a 
farming town and a tobacco town. It was also the

06:33.603 --> 06:35.384
county seat. And all of the trials of the county 
were there. And it was the headquarters for most of

06:37.346 --> 06:40.709
the lawyers of the area. At age 12, when I was 12, my 
father's health became bad. And he was advised to

06:47.354 --> 06:51.038
move to a climate that was somewhat warmer in the 
wintertime. And because we had relatives in

06:51.898 --> 06:59.985
Texas, my grandfather, Schuller, having left the 
Holston Conference sometime before and having

07:00.353 --> 07:06.259
joined the Central Texas Conference as a 
Methodist preacher, we decided to try Texas. And

07:07.059 --> 07:15.828
my father came to Texas first, and after a year sent 
for us, and he had settled in Mejia, Texas in

07:07.059 --> 07:15.828
Limestone County. I was 12 years old when we came to 
Mejia. My brother was three and a half years

07:19.812 --> 07:22.514
younger. It seemed to me that the transition from 
life in the little mountain town of Lebanon to life

07:26.746 --> 07:33.717
in my head was perhaps harder on me than it was on 
anybody else, at least I felt that way about it. I

07:34.418 --> 07:40.607
was leaving all my friends, I was leaving my 
baseball team and my buddies, and I didn't know

07:34.418 --> 07:40.607
anybody. It was a completely new area, new school, 
new state, new type of people. I just felt totally

07:45.434 --> 07:50.983
out of place and miserable there in my head when I 
came there. At the time, that I moved there in 1927,

07:53.138 --> 07:57.483
Mahale was a dying oil town. It had at one time been 
the largest oil field in the world.

08:01.568 --> 08:05.252
Mahale-Wortham Field combination was the 
biggest oil field in the world. Produced more oil

08:05.812 --> 08:10.317
than any other known oil field up to that time. But 
the field was dying, the companies were pulling

08:11.819 --> 08:18.126
out, some of the rigs were left, and they were 
pumping. And I well remember the first few nights

08:18.146 --> 08:22.251
that I slept in our new house that my father had 
built for us there in Maham. I kept hearing this

08:26.245 --> 08:30.072
steady drumming sound and I didn't know what it 
was. There wasn't anything like that up in the

08:30.172 --> 08:33.457
mountains where I'd come from. And I, after some 
days, possibly even weeks, when the sound just

08:33.497 --> 08:45.598
filled the air at night and you could still hear it 
in the daytime, I got upnerved enough to ask

08:33.497 --> 08:45.598
somebody what it was. And it turned out to be the 
pumping of the the rigs out in the field five or six

08:48.674 --> 08:52.799
miles from Mahea. At night you could hear this 
sound for miles and it was very distracting to

08:53.280 --> 09:00.590
someone who was not used to it. In time I got used to 
it, paid no attention to it at all, but it was

09:00.730 --> 09:05.737
interesting.

09:07.920 --> 09:13.467
My father's health problems had pretty well 
strapped the family financially and We had barely

09:14.105 --> 09:18.150
got well settled in Mahea until the Great 
Depression hit. And this was, of course, a very bad

09:18.810 --> 09:24.036
economic time for everybody, including lawyers 
in the new area. There wasn't much money coming in.

09:26.659 --> 09:30.764
And I thought that I ought to find work and make what 
I could. So I suppose I was perhaps 14 or 15 when,

09:30.824 --> 09:40.595
maybe a little earlier, when I first started 
taking every known job that I could get paid money.

09:41.296 --> 09:42.998
I did all sorts of things. mowed yards, chopped 
cotton, which was a rather difficult job and paid

09:43.417 --> 09:50.702
fairly well, but it was a very grueling job. I 
picked cotton. I well recall picking cotton for a

09:52.528 --> 09:56.160
dollar a hundred for a full summer. and it takes a 
whole lot of cotton to in a week's time at a dollar a

09:56.579 --> 10:23.802
hundred to bring your paycheck up to fifteen or 
twenty dollars you're you're working from dawn to

09:56.579 --> 10:23.802
dark but I really enjoyed cotton picking perhaps 
more than any other job that I did because there was

09:56.579 --> 10:23.802
a friendship and a camaraderie among the pickers 
the black and white working together we told

09:56.579 --> 10:23.802
stories swapped yarns as we moved down the rows and 
the fast pickers were very kind they'd help me,

10:23.782 --> 10:38.597
teach me how to pick a little more, a little faster, 
and at lunchtime we'd pull our cotton sacks up

10:23.782 --> 10:38.597
under the wagon out of the sun and eat our 
sandwiches or lunches and crack a coke if we had one

10:23.782 --> 10:38.597
and generally enjoy ourselves. It was hard work 
but it was in a way very rewarding work and I enjoyed

10:38.617 --> 10:46.606
the summers that I spent, two or three of them, 
picking cotton. Meantime, of course, I was back in

10:47.907 --> 10:50.650
the small domestic livestock business there at 
home. I had two milk cows of my own and sold milk in

10:54.423 --> 11:09.018
the neighborhood and I raised rabbits which I 
dressed and had a good market for both the furs

10:54.423 --> 11:09.018
which I shipped off and the meat to restaurants 
there in town. I had a very regular killing

11:09.098 --> 11:17.546
schedule and delivery schedule and made pretty 
good money out of the rabbits and pigeons and other

11:09.098 --> 11:17.546
things that I had. I never would work with anything 
or handle any type of livestock that I could not

11:19.250 --> 11:26.624
make pay for itself because I simply couldn't 
afford to. And I suppose I was rather, what shall I

11:27.305 --> 11:32.134
say, I was tight with a dollar then. I still am to 
some extent because these hard times made me feel

11:32.214 --> 11:42.253
that money was a very valuable commodity if you 
could get it some way or other. I enjoyed my school

11:43.600 --> 11:48.247
life after I got to high school. I was out of place 
pretty much the first year or two in the last two

11:48.307 --> 11:55.978
grades of elementary school, simply because I 
didn't know anybody. But in a couple of years, I

11:56.038 --> 11:59.563
managed to get on the softball team there. And I 
began to take up tennis and proved to be quite a good

11:59.623 --> 12:04.090
tennis player. And so by the time I got into high 
school, which was only three years in those days, I

12:04.677 --> 12:13.789
had a number of friends, both boys and girls, and 
people to play with. And I was on the softball team,

12:14.550 --> 12:25.445
and I was both the singles player and on the doubles 
team for the high school in tennis for three

12:14.550 --> 12:25.445
consecutive years. Twice I went to state meet. I 
didn't win anything, but at least I did. get by the

12:30.327 --> 12:34.212
district and got to state meet and had the fun of 
going and so on. I was also on the high school

12:34.813 --> 12:52.116
debating team, which gave me a number of bad speech 
habits which I never was able to overcome, one of

12:34.813 --> 12:52.116
which was, of course, talking much too fast under 
any sort of pressure situation in order to be able

12:34.813 --> 12:52.116
to make all the points I felt that I had to make as a 
debater. However, my partner and I, Sam was my

12:52.568 --> 12:56.337
partner. He and I were very successful debaters 
for a couple of years. And we also went to state meet

12:59.966 --> 13:02.832
and debate. And I recall at one of the state meets, I 
was in the unfortunate situation of having an

13:06.018 --> 13:13.068
important debate called at the same time a tennis 
match was called. The only thing I could do was

13:13.869 --> 13:19.937
forfeit one of them, and I chose to forfeit the 
tennis match because I felt we might have a better

13:13.869 --> 13:19.937
chance in debate. We lost the debate match, but I 
think I would have also lost the tennis match, so I

13:20.578 --> 13:27.047
really didn't lose very much. I graduated from 
high school in 1932 and had managed to save up

13:29.474 --> 13:54.857
enough money from my summer's work and also from a 
newspaper route that I had carried for several

13:29.474 --> 13:54.857
years there in Mahea and from the profits from my 
small livestock operations to at least see my way

13:29.474 --> 13:54.857
to one year and possibly two of college or 
university. I wanted to go to Washington Lee,

13:55.478 --> 13:59.562
where my father had gone, and study law. But this 
seemed out of the question, because it was a long

14:00.083 --> 14:11.755
way away, and the tuition costs and so forth in 
those days were comparatively high as compared to

14:00.083 --> 14:11.755
the local schools in Texas. So in the end, I did what 
many other people did. Mr. Burnett, who is sitting

14:14.978 --> 14:24.928
here and looking rather questioning, is a Texas 
Aggie, and I rather hate to tell him that I decided

14:14.978 --> 14:24.928
to opt to go to the University of Texas at Austin. 
This I did. I went down to the University of Texas

14:26.740 --> 14:39.484
and I went early with the idea that perhaps if I went 
a little early in the fall I could find a job

14:26.740 --> 14:39.484
somewhere in Austin and make my money go a little 
further. Well, I was very lucky. I hadn't been in

14:43.707 --> 15:11.622
Austin very long at the university I was over at the 
in front of the registrar's office one day when a

14:43.707 --> 15:11.622
lady came in from down in the valley somewhere I 
just remember now just where she was from but she

14:43.707 --> 15:11.622
was a very nice lady and she was bringing her son to 
put him in school at Austin as a freshman he too was

14:43.707 --> 15:11.622
going to be a freshman and I had been there a few days 
and knew where things were so I just happened to

14:43.707 --> 15:11.622
meet the son and talking to him. He didn't know 
where to go, so I volunteered to show him and his

15:12.817 --> 15:16.783
mother around for half a day. After I had done this 
for about four hours, I was getting along very well

15:18.165 --> 15:24.213
with both the boy and his mother. They were very, 
very nice people. They seemed to like me, and I

15:25.976 --> 15:28.139
certainly liked them. She asked me if I'd have 
lunch with them, and I was happy to do this. And

15:32.885 --> 15:36.030
while at lunch, she asked me if I would like to work 
for her. She was going to open a boy's boarding

15:36.190 --> 15:38.593
house. She already had the boarding house there. 
And she was going to open this boarding house. And

15:43.358 --> 15:56.597
my job was to be to try to recruit students who came 
to the university to live in the boarding house and

15:43.358 --> 15:56.597
then sort of help her manage the house after it was 
full. For this, I was to get a room and my meals. This

16:01.503 --> 16:06.330
sounded very good to me, and I accepted the job with 
gratitude. and managed to do this. In fact, in

16:07.951 --> 16:12.880
about ten days I had the room full of students, the 
house full of students. Most of them were freshmen

16:12.920 --> 16:24.199
and they had made their deposits and Mrs. Jones, 
who was the lady, was very, very happy and I was

16:12.920 --> 16:24.199
happy and I did, in fact, work for her for a couple of 
years there. So I got off to a good start in my life at

16:24.279 --> 16:29.428
college. I had not thought too much about what I'd 
like to major in, but had changed my mind from

16:31.758 --> 16:42.334
thinking about law largely at my father's 
urgings. He had not been happy in the legal

16:42.374 --> 17:00.482
business, although he had made a good deal of money 
in Virginia, but he had never really liked the law,

16:42.374 --> 17:00.482
I think, and he kept insisting that this was not a 
good profession for me to follow, though I thought

16:42.374 --> 17:00.482
really that it was, and I still think perhaps I 
might have made a good lawyer. In any case, I

17:00.968 --> 17:04.193
decided that I would study chemical engineering. 
I think the reason was that some of the engineering

17:04.273 --> 17:21.501
older students at Texas wore boots and little 
riding pants tucked into their boots, and they

17:04.273 --> 17:21.501
looked very virile and masculine and experienced 
and worldly, and I thought, my, it would be nice to

17:04.273 --> 17:21.501
be an engineer. Perhaps I, too, would be an 
engineer. So I majored in chemical engineering,

17:23.463 --> 17:26.628
or at least declared for it. I did fairly well in the 
coursework the first year, but I was not

17:27.149 --> 17:32.917
particularly interested in it. And I disliked 
mechanical drawing or drafting very much indeed.

17:38.666 --> 17:45.697
I had a teacher, unfortunately, who taught me 
something that I've thought about many years in my

17:38.666 --> 17:45.697
own teaching experience. He had absolutely no 
patience with my early efforts, and I had a slight

17:46.338 --> 17:52.407
tremor in my right hand, and I couldn't join the 
lines as accurately as he would like for me to join

17:52.640 --> 17:56.204
him. I could read blueprints and was good enough in 
theory, but I simply could not draw very well. And

18:02.011 --> 18:10.481
he would come up in front of the class and take my 
drawings and make all manner of fun of them and

18:02.011 --> 18:10.481
criticize them and tell me I could never be an 
engineer. So after a while, I rather decided

18:11.182 --> 18:15.327
whether I could be an engineer or not. If this was an 
engineer, I didn't want to be one. And so I gave up

18:18.451 --> 18:22.275
the engineering profession and switched than to 
mathematics, in which I had done quite well. I

18:27.461 --> 18:29.746
stayed with mathematics a while. And then in my 
third year, and I, of course, was working through

18:29.806 --> 18:39.066
the summers, it looked as though I might graduate 
someday in mathematics. I had also taken a number

18:39.552 --> 18:56.011
of education courses so that I might be qualified 
to teach if I chose to do so, though I had for a time

18:39.552 --> 18:56.011
thought of working as a mathematician for an oil 
company or perhaps an actuarial service for an

18:39.552 --> 18:56.011
insurance company, something of this sort. In any 
case, meantime I had met the girl that I was going to

18:57.292 --> 19:01.797
marry. there in Texas. She was a Miss Minnie Lee 
Canterbury of Clarksville, Texas which is one of

19:03.702 --> 19:28.678
the oldest towns in the state and she was a pure 
English descent and a very beautiful girl and much

19:03.702 --> 19:28.678
to my happiness and pleasure she seemed to like me 
very much and I certainly fell in love heavily with

19:03.702 --> 19:28.678
her and by the time I was within about a year of 
possible graduation we were talking about

19:03.702 --> 19:28.678
marriage plans And we're seeing each other every 
day after class and so on, a typical college

19:29.063 --> 19:34.692
romance, I guess one would say. So I switched to an 
English education major because I knew I could

19:35.994 --> 19:43.025
graduate quickly and thought that I could 
probably get a job. This I did. That is, I did, in

19:46.210 --> 19:57.147
1935, graduate with an AB degree in English and a 
minor in education. However, jobs weren't as

19:58.848 --> 20:01.872
easily come by as I'd thought they were. I had taken 
a job in the last six months or so while I was still a

20:01.892 --> 20:11.644
student before graduation selling adding 
machines on commission in Austin. I was walking up

20:11.764 --> 20:18.612
and down the street trying to sell adding machines 
to small commercial businesses. My machine was a

20:18.672 --> 20:22.798
10 key machine. I believe, if I recall rightly, it 
was an old Remington. In any case, I was not the

20:26.219 --> 20:42.338
world's greatest adding machine salesman 
because though I'd done all sorts of things, I was

20:26.219 --> 20:42.338
always a little hesitant about walking into a 
perfect stranger and taking up his time trying to

20:26.219 --> 20:42.338
present a product, trying to sell things to him. 
And I have never forgot some advice that the

20:43.195 --> 20:52.229
typewriter man for the Austin firm gave some of us 
juniors one time. He knew what a struggle we were

20:52.289 --> 21:01.804
having and also how important it was to us to be able 
to sell and make our commissions because we were

20:52.289 --> 21:01.804
working on a straight commission basis. A good 
commission, but commission only if you sold a

21:02.104 --> 21:06.351
machine, of course. What he said was something 
like this. He said, I know just how you young people

21:09.047 --> 21:22.078
feel about walking into a tired, harassed 
businessman and asking him for his time and trying

21:09.047 --> 21:22.078
to sell him a machine that maybe you feel he might 
not need or he can't pay for or what have you. But he

21:23.307 --> 21:25.894
said, I want you to think about it like this. When 
that man gets up in the morning, he puts on his pants

21:26.476 --> 21:31.951
one leg at a time, just like you do. He's a human 
being. You have a good product. Now, I would say

21:35.541 --> 21:38.329
just remember this fact. We're all human. And walk 
in there and present your product because you're

21:39.624 --> 21:44.694
actually doing him a favor. If you can sell him the 
product, it will pay for itself in a very short time

21:45.175 --> 21:49.844
in his business. You're doing him a favor, you're 
doing yourself a favor, and you're doing the

21:50.205 --> 21:54.834
American economy a favor. You made a real 
inspirational speech. So the next day, next

21:56.990 --> 22:07.448
morning when I started out, the first thing I 
thought of when I came to my first prospect's place

21:56.990 --> 22:07.448
of business was about that remark about the man's 
putting on his pants one leg at a time. And I could

22:07.468 --> 22:09.231
just see him getting up and doing it. Somehow this 
relieved me of a great deal of tension. And I sold

22:12.156 --> 22:17.786
three machines that day and seemed to have very 
little trouble selling the machines thereafter.

22:17.806 --> 22:20.230
I didn't sell a great number, but I sold enough to 
make enough commission to see that I would be able,

22:20.598 --> 22:27.924
easily enough, to support myself, if necessary, 
as an attic machine salesman. I did not really want

22:28.725 --> 22:47.381
to do this, however, and just before school 
started in the fall of 1935, the placement office

22:28.725 --> 22:47.381
at university called me in and said they had heard 
of an opening at Anderson, Texas, a small town, the

22:28.725 --> 22:47.381
county seat of Grimes County. Now, I had Struggled 
all summer long and back into the spring trying to

22:50.602 --> 22:57.993
find a job teaching for that is what I wanted to do. I 
must have written over a hundred letters of

22:58.694 --> 23:07.968
application to various places in which I heard 
there were openings or which the placement office

22:58.694 --> 23:07.968
told me there were openings. But very few of these 
were answered because I had no experience and many

23:08.789 --> 23:18.223
experienced teachers were out of jobs and school 
people could pick and choose. They could hire

23:18.283 --> 23:20.406
anyone they wanted to. I even walked eight miles to 
a little country school from the nearest bus. I

23:26.099 --> 23:36.132
walked there at four o'clock and left four o'clock 
in the morning and walked eight miles to the

23:26.099 --> 23:36.132
superintendent's house thinking I would be the 
first person to be interviewed for a simple

23:26.099 --> 23:36.132
teaching job. I found five experienced people, 
men with families, waiting on the porch when I got

23:36.693 --> 23:43.943
there around six o'clock. And I was so discouraged 
that I simply caught a ride with the mailman back to

23:44.664 --> 23:50.832
the bus stop and came back to Austin. There was 
obviously no chance for me to be hired. However,

23:54.542 --> 24:00.692
this job in Anderson had come open at the very last 
minute. It came about in an odd way. The young man

24:04.619 --> 24:16.498
who had been principal there for several years had 
somehow or other got on the, shall I say, the wrong

24:04.619 --> 24:16.498
side of the high school boys whom he taught and whom 
he coached. And they had thrown him out of a

24:17.002 --> 24:25.854
second-story window of the high school, breaking 
his right arm, fracturing his collarbone, and

24:17.002 --> 24:25.854
doing a few other bits of damage to him. It was a 
rather rowdy group, shall I say. And when he came to

24:30.480 --> 24:36.088
in the Navasota Hospital, his first vow was, I'll 
never go back in that school again. And he didn't.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.432
Thus left the job open. I was told this in advance, 
but of course I wanted a job desperately, and I

24:40.289 --> 24:48.538
decided to go over and interview for the job. I will 
not forget that interview. It was a rather

24:50.740 --> 24:52.442
interesting one. It was held in a fine old farm home 
built almost 100 years prior to the fall of 1935 on

24:53.603 --> 25:05.436
the outskirts of Anderson. The home belonged to an 
old gentleman named Neblett, N-E-B-L-E-T-T,

25:05.973 --> 25:14.470
who, as I recall, was president of the school 
board. And the board held its meeting to interview

25:15.492 --> 25:26.293
me for the job and to interview one other teacher 
for an elementary teaching job in his living room.

25:28.720 --> 25:32.565
When I went in, there was the board, Mr. Neblett and 
Mr. Wilson. I can remember Mr. Vic Borski and one of

25:32.725 --> 25:40.116
the finest men who ever lived, who was the local 
blacksmith and a grand person. Mr. Jennings, Dr.

25:40.837 --> 25:44.862
Emmy Parker, another grand person. In fact, they 
were all real fine people. But some of them were

25:48.167 --> 25:52.913
outstanding to me as the years went by. Of course, I 
didn't know any of these people then. They looked

25:55.036 --> 25:56.618
very forbidding. little over 19 years old, 
soaking wet, and weighed about 130 pounds. And I

26:00.685 --> 26:04.972
had very little hope of getting the job. However, I 
was encouraged somewhat to note that there were no

26:05.413 --> 26:14.366
other applicants in the room except me and the 
young lady who was to be interviewed for a grade

26:05.413 --> 26:14.366
school position. So I was called before the board 
in its wisdom. And Mr. Neblett carried on most of

26:19.954 --> 26:22.538
the questioning. He asked me about my background, 
my credentials, what I had done, my college work

26:23.075 --> 26:33.191
and so on, whether I was married and so forth and so 
on, all of which seemed to satisfy him well enough.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.699
And then Mr. Jennings came up with the $64 
question. He said something like this, well, Mr.

26:37.719 --> 26:44.430
Kidd, your credentials are good enough, but 
you're mighty small, and that's a rough bunch of

26:37.719 --> 26:44.430
boys. Can you discipline them? I said, what? He 
said, can you discipline them? I said, well, I'm

26:50.834 --> 26:53.558
not exactly sure what you mean. If you mean, can I 
whip them? I can't, obviously, neither

26:56.001 --> 26:59.506
individually nor collectively. But I said, I can 
teach them, and I don't think I'll need to

26:59.927 --> 27:05.295
discipline them physically. I said, I have a 
feeling I can get along with them very well. And he

27:09.000 --> 27:13.146
just frowned and shook his head, and I thought, 
well, there goes at least one vote. But Dr. Parker

27:13.801 --> 27:25.276
and some of the others seemed to like what I had 
said, and they asked me to go out of the room and wait

27:13.801 --> 27:25.276
a while while they decided on my fate, whether I 
should be employed or not. And I spent 15 or 20

27:26.037 --> 27:34.748
minutes in considerable suspense and then was 
called back in the room, and Mr. Neblett told me

27:26.037 --> 27:34.748
that I was hired in a most interesting way. He said, 
well, Mr. Kidd, we've decided to hire you because

27:34.828 --> 27:41.597
we haven't got any other applicants, but I'll tell 
you, you'll never make it. With this happy

27:42.320 --> 27:48.617
thought, I accepted the job and went to Anderson. 
and a rather interesting sort of job. I was to be the

27:53.324 --> 28:08.047
principal of the high school and also the 
principal of the elementary school, and combined

27:53.324 --> 28:08.047
in one job, I was to teach mathematics, shop, 
general science, and to coach basketball,

27:53.324 --> 28:08.047
baseball, track, and tennis. I was also to assist 
the secretary of the school board, and for this

28:08.688 --> 28:17.001
work, I would be paid $80 a month on a nine-month 
basis. Well, $80 a month was not bad money, really,

28:18.787 --> 28:31.931
in those days, even for nine months, because the 
apartment that I was able to rent, a small upstairs

28:18.787 --> 28:31.931
apartment for my wife and myself, cost $10 a month, 
bills paid. Eggs were something like $0.08 or

28:33.193 --> 28:37.681
$0.10 a dozen, bread, a nickel a loaf. I had a dog, 
and I could feed my dog more. good neck meat, soup

28:41.939 --> 28:48.936
meat, fresh cut by the local butcher for a nickel a 
day than we can now buy for a dollar. Things were

28:49.137 --> 28:53.046
cheap, and the $80 proved to go a long way. I didn't 
feel bad about that. I went into this job with some

28:56.840 --> 29:06.554
degree of trepidation, not knowing what I would 
find, but what I did find was four of the happiest

28:56.840 --> 29:06.554
and most rewarding years of my life. I made 
wonderful friends there I never had. I can

29:10.480 --> 29:17.149
honestly say that I never had the slightest 
trouble with any of the high school boys or the

29:10.480 --> 29:17.149
girls. They were a serious, dedicated, 
hardworking, and hard-playing bunch of young

29:17.249 --> 29:22.577
people. They were divided into three ethnic 
groups. There were Germans, Poles, and what they

29:25.950 --> 29:31.896
referred to as Americans. The reason this ethnic 
division took place was the fact that a German, a

29:31.956 --> 29:48.413
body of Germans had settled in the community, had 
established the Lutheran Church, and had a

29:31.956 --> 29:48.413
parochial school of its own up through the seventh 
grade for many years prior to the time I came there.

29:49.237 --> 29:52.264
Also, a group of Poles had settled in the 
community. They were fine farmers, and they had

29:52.304 --> 30:03.551
established a Catholic church and had a Catholic 
parochial school, also for many years prior to the

29:52.304 --> 30:03.551
time I'd gone to Anderson. The other people were 
so-called old families who referred...
