00:02.208 --> 00:11.461
Now,

00:02.208 --> 00:11.461
I think this machine is for work. Well, after you 
left this ranch, did you come here immediately?

00:19.152 --> 00:22.958
No, my husband was working here with the 
Hawaiinan. What is it called now? The Hawaiinan?

00:25.722 --> 00:26.983
The Hawaiinan, yes. Well, he had a ranch with the 
lady. with Maria McEmbra, a teacher. Yes. That's

00:33.426 --> 00:35.188
what she worked with. She worked with my father. 
She also sowed. Yes. Because she wanted them to

00:39.073 --> 00:45.041
work on the land they had. It wasn't much, but they 
worked on it. Yes. My father worked on it and sowed

00:49.266 --> 00:51.029
it. He sowed corn, beans, whatever he sowed, he 
gave it to him. Yes. That's why I told him, I said, I

00:56.292 --> 01:02.381
don't want half of it, Juan, I don't want it. All I 
want is for you to work for my land, because I want my

01:02.401 --> 01:10.233
land to be worked for, so that they don't take it 
away from us, sell it to us. And they said, well,

01:10.313 --> 01:12.156
when you do what you do, come. And I said, yes. They 
came and brought pumpkins, eggplants, candy,

01:13.899 --> 01:20.549
everything my father planted, they came and 
brought it. My father went and said, there's this

01:20.569 --> 01:23.734
and that, because they're going to bring it. I used 
to take care of a kid who had to go to school. And

01:30.597 --> 01:34.283
there was a lot of corn. When we came from Kelaren, 
we packed up and went to Rancho Uribe. And that's

01:45.420 --> 01:48.464
where we went to work. To unload, to chop, to wet the 
land.

01:57.987 --> 02:15.001
Before

01:57.987 --> 02:15.001
you came here to Mexico during the war, can you tell 
us something about the war? Why is there a war in

02:15.021 --> 02:17.764
Mexico? I don't know. No, I don't know. My father 
never told us that. No? Never? No, he never told us

02:25.911 --> 02:27.572
why. Well, it's just that the war was done, as it's 
done here, by any Chucutani. That's how the war was

02:33.668 --> 02:37.914
done in Mexico. I don't know with whom they fought 
in Mexico. I don't know much about that. It's just

02:45.946 --> 02:50.453
that that year was when they came here. They came 
here to Matamoros, and from there they went here.

02:56.221 --> 02:56.461
Yes. Since then, we've never... I didn't know 
about Mexico until they died. My father and my

03:01.315 --> 03:02.297
mother died. Because they didn't know that my aunt 
was in Matamoros, on the other side of Brandeis.

03:10.991 --> 03:16.359
And I was a little sad because my mother and my 
father died. And because I didn't know so much,

03:16.379 --> 03:21.407
they said that they were going to take me there. And 
my aunt came and we lived there. Well, this war was

03:26.024 --> 03:29.328
called the Revolution. The Mexican Revolution. 
Was it a good thing for Mexico or not? I don't know.

03:37.156 --> 03:37.677
No? I don't know.

03:42.181 --> 03:49.930
Your mom or dad never said... No, they... Well, 
they talked to other gentlemen. Yes. But we didn't

03:50.370 --> 03:54.715
pay much attention because they... Well, I don't 
know. My father and my mother had those customs.

04:02.159 --> 04:05.364
When they came to talk, they were the only ones 
there. We were the ones in charge of the kitchen.

04:09.610 --> 04:16.341
And they talked to the men and women in the kitchen. 
When my mother came to talk to the women, to visit

04:17.082 --> 04:22.390
them, They were talking to each other and we were in 
the kitchen cooking and it was almost noon. When

04:30.696 --> 04:37.368
the food was ready, we would talk to my mother and my 
aunt. When the girls came to visit us, they would go

04:37.408 --> 04:47.466
to the kitchen with my aunt and my mother and we 
would talk to the girls.

04:48.374 --> 04:52.319
And they would prepare the food for us. When it was 
ready, they would bring their girls to eat and we

04:52.359 --> 04:58.747
would eat. They were the neighbors. Before they 
weren't. And now the boys know everything because

05:01.331 --> 05:08.520
they hear everything and they listen to 
everything first than the older ones. We weren't.

05:09.061 --> 05:11.684
We were the most different people before. They 
weren't like they were. The parents were very

05:13.754 --> 05:16.577
reserved. They talked to the people who came to 
visit them. The ladies too. And now the boys

05:23.983 --> 05:31.770
realize everything, the conversations of the 
parents or other people. And we didn't. My parents

05:32.911 --> 05:41.179
were raised differently and we were raised like 
them. Other models, not like now. But the models

05:43.638 --> 05:46.103
are very different. Well, your mother had sadness 
for Mexico. Yes, she said it was her homeland and

05:53.595 --> 06:00.227
everything, but here it is, here are my children, 
here is my family. My mother died, my brothers.

06:05.075 --> 06:06.778
What am I going to do in Mexico? Her mother's 
siblings were in Mexico. Yes, but they died. Her

06:12.426 --> 06:15.870
mother and her two siblings died. Only her little 
sister lives in Mexico. She lives in Padilla,

06:18.593 --> 06:21.037
Tamaulipas. That's my mother's little sister. 
Her name is Edelmira Balboa.

06:32.671 --> 06:35.955
The governor of Tamaulipas Prageres Balboa. I 
didn't hear him say it. I didn't hear him say it.

06:42.909 --> 06:50.499
Prageres Balboa, who was the governor of Texas, 
who is...

06:42.909 --> 06:50.499
What's his name? Do you know what the governor of 
Texas is called? Well, I understand. Yeah, but I

06:57.628 --> 07:00.531
forgot his name. Well, just like the governor of 
Texas, in the United States. Yes. That man,

07:05.652 --> 07:13.287
Rajerez Balboa, is my aunt's brother, my mother's 
little sister. Your aunt's brother and governor?

07:15.251 --> 07:26.193
Yes, he was governor from Tamaulipas to 
Matamoros, because it's Tamaulipas to

07:15.251 --> 07:26.193
Matamoros,

07:15.251 --> 07:26.193
right? Yes. Texas, the capital of Texas is Austin, 
Texas. And the capital of Tamaulipas is Ciudad

07:31.074 --> 07:39.825
Victoria, up to Matamoros. Well, he was governor 
from Ciudad Victoria to Matamoros, my uncle. He's

07:44.831 --> 07:47.775
my aunt's little brother. In what year was he 
governor? Last year he was. Now I don't know who was

07:51.448 --> 07:55.754
the governor of the state of Tamaulipas. He was the 
governor of Tamaulipas. He was the governor of

08:02.043 --> 08:04.827
Tamaulipas. And he is the brother of his aunt? My 
uncle's brother. Your uncle's brother. Is he your

08:15.711 --> 08:16.351
uncle? Yes, he's my uncle because my mother... My 
mother's sister is... She's my mother's mother's

08:16.472 --> 08:36.177
daughter, but she didn't... My mother had another 
relative, because her father was another, and

08:16.472 --> 08:36.177
then my grandmother became a widow and married 
that man. And my aunt was born. Yes. And he had a lot

08:39.545 --> 08:44.309
of education. My aunt? Yes. My aunt from Elmira? 
Yes. Oh, yes. She had school in Mexico. Yes. She had

08:51.115 --> 08:53.117
school in Mexico. In Mexico, I have a nephew. He's a 
nephew because his mother is my first sister. He's

09:02.946 --> 09:06.209
the daughter of a sister of my father, sister of my 
father. And the boy? He is the son of my cousin, and

09:09.312 --> 09:13.839
he is a public servant. He is a very unintelligent 
man, the boy. And he took me out about a month ago. He

09:23.255 --> 09:28.063
took out my baptismal certificate. Yes. Because I 
didn't have it, and I needed that paper. Why didn't

09:34.439 --> 09:37.025
I have faith in baptism? Because I was baptized 
when I was very little and my father came to Mexico,

09:37.085 --> 09:44.721
to the United States, and they never gave me faith 
in baptism. Because at that time they didn't give

09:44.741 --> 09:53.680
faith in baptism, only that all the records 
remained in the church where the children were

09:44.741 --> 09:53.680
baptized. Because there were no fathers like 
here, standing up. They came from other big towns

09:58.527 --> 10:03.755
to do baptism, to baptize children. Every two 
years my mother and every third year they came to

10:03.775 --> 10:08.483
baptize. And when I was born, it was the time when I 
was coming from the father to baptize. And it was

10:14.493 --> 10:16.156
when they baptized me. But there were papers in 
Padil, in Padil's church.

10:23.630 --> 10:29.197
Well, I think this machine is better, because the 
other machine had a problem.

10:32.020 --> 10:38.027
His uncle, his name was Balboa, Mr. Balboa, who was 
governor. Yes, like two years ago, I don't know.

10:40.490 --> 10:42.773
And his family? I don't know his family. When we 
went, my uncle said that my uncle, when he was

10:45.616 --> 10:52.725
announced and came to Nuevo Laredo, When the 
governor of Texas came. Ah, yes. I heard him say

10:59.373 --> 11:04.861
that the governor of Tamaulipas was going to come. 
And he was from a rich family, or poor, or

11:04.881 --> 11:09.488
middle-aged? I don't know. No, his father was

11:12.993 --> 11:19.422
the administrator of the hacienda. Ah, from 
Hacienda de Dolores. His father was an

11:23.819 --> 11:27.203
administrator. He was the administrator of the 
farm. Yes, yes. Well, in Mexico, as humble as a

11:33.112 --> 11:39.621
family is, what makes it to be introduced among 
other people who know about it. Because of their

11:46.808 --> 11:50.833
language, right? Yes. Because of their 
education. Yes. That boy is very humble. Yes. His

11:56.702 --> 11:58.464
father was a worker at a ranch. He was a cowherd, as 
they say here in Caboes. Yes. His father. His

12:03.551 --> 12:04.933
father. The boy's father. But his father died as a 
result of that. They were raising a lot of cattle. A

12:15.289 --> 12:17.631
lot of cattle. And they came over him and a very 
brave bull came over him. He went over him, over the

12:23.638 --> 12:29.744
horse and he hit him. He was very bad. His father 
died. They stayed there for half a year. His mother

12:33.068 --> 12:38.053
had them in school and he graduated from school. 
And my aunt said, He was a very polite boy. He was

12:43.551 --> 12:49.377
very simple, but he had a very good education. Ah, 
yes. And this is the most important thing in

12:51.139 --> 12:53.962
Mexico. Education. Education. Is it the same 
here? What? Education. Education. Is it the most

13:00.349 --> 13:03.352
important thing here? I think so. The 
opportunity. For work. Yes. And in Mexico too. He

13:10.372 --> 13:17.804
is a boy who has a lot of intelligence, he has a very 
good memory. He will soon finish his school. I have

13:20.628 --> 13:24.594
a nephew here. He is the youngest of my brothers. He 
graduated from school in May. He has very good, how

13:32.426 --> 13:37.915
do you say? Él tiene muy buenos grados y muy 
inteligente en la escuela. Sí. Y él tiene plan de,

13:44.933 --> 13:51.580
ya tiene todo arreglado porque él quiere ir al 
colegio. Sí. Quiere ir al colegio. Y nada menos

13:53.402 --> 13:59.248
ayer le habló el sargento porque lo que dice que 
tiene muy buenos requisitos. Sí. De los marines.

14:02.271 --> 14:03.112
Quieren llevárselo. Sí. Porque dice que tiene un 
muchachito muy guay. who has a lot of intelligence

14:09.147 --> 14:13.291
in studying and everything. And he said he had a 
plan. He asked other people, what plans do you

14:14.512 --> 14:17.835
have? I have a plan to go to college. Yes. Well, he 
says, we'll give you college. We'll give you

14:23.961 --> 14:28.626
training and we'll give you everything. Yes. But 
who knows what he's going to do. He wants to go to

14:32.649 --> 14:35.232
college. Yes. He's curious. And he just turned 18. 
He graduated from school and now he has plans to

14:37.868 --> 14:42.478
spend the rest of his life on alcohol.
