WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:04.988
when you had been trained as an artillery officer? 
Well, communications was a major part of training

00:06.150 --> 00:14.863
of any artillery officer because the artillery 
cannot function without good communications.

00:14.883 --> 00:28.823
Actually, we were very proud of the fact that many 
times the entire division depended on artillery

00:14.883 --> 00:28.823
communications for a commanding general to be 
able to communicate with his troops. So there's a

00:30.187 --> 00:37.454
lot of emphasis on wire and radio for any artillery 
officer's training. I had kind of an aptitude for

00:37.474 --> 00:46.042
that,

00:37.474 --> 00:46.042
and some love of it. So for instance, as a 
reconnaissance officer, that's a major

00:46.062 --> 00:54.590
responsibility, being able to communicate 
working with wire and radio. So it wasn't a

00:57.012 --> 00:59.434
neurological assignment at all. and I served then 
as communication officer and commander of

01:01.169 --> 01:19.330
headquarters battery until after we'd been in 
combat for 30 days and then I was moved into the fire

01:01.169 --> 01:19.330
direction center.

01:19.710 --> 01:29.742
That was the second time I'd been assigned as 
assistant

01:19.710 --> 01:29.742
S3 operations officer.

01:32.067 --> 01:37.598
So in other words, then you were the assistant 
commander? No, not assistant commander,

01:38.199 --> 01:43.370
assistant operations officer. That's a fire 
direction officer. The person that does that has a

01:48.199 --> 01:53.991
job running the fire direction center.

01:55.743 --> 02:03.171
Usually a person that does that has to be fairly 
good in mathematics because it's pretty much a

01:55.743 --> 02:03.171
mathematical exercise.

02:06.295 --> 02:06.935
I like that. How did you like your first command? 
Well, there were mixed emotions about that.

02:13.422 --> 02:24.855
Headquarters battery commander is not a good 
command job because while you're commander, On

02:25.426 --> 02:31.113
the headquarters staff, you have to take care of 
all of the officers that rank higher than you do.

02:32.855 --> 02:46.452
And most of the men in a headquarters battery are 
assigned to a section commanded by an officer that

02:32.855 --> 02:46.452
outranks the headquarters battery commander. So 
it's not the best command job there is. Still, I

02:52.941 --> 02:54.943
like the command job. and was able to get along with 
the higher ranking officers. And how many men did

03:00.249 --> 03:04.094
you have under your control? Oh, I think 
headquarters battery had about 120 men in those

03:04.114 --> 03:09.120
days. And as far as headquarters battery is 
concerned, what you do is, well explain exactly.

03:19.730 --> 03:23.776
The tactical job, it was combined with 
communication officers. So the tactical

03:23.936 --> 03:28.362
responsibility of the headquarters battery 
commander was communications. And the

03:29.744 --> 03:49.112
administrative responsibility was, of course, 
supplies, rations,

03:29.744 --> 03:49.112
command of the troops, taking care of the 
administrative matters related to the troops

03:29.744 --> 03:49.112
that manned the different sections of the 
headquarters.

03:54.121 --> 03:55.463
How were you doing on D-Day? I was sitting off the 
coast of Normandy in a Liberty ship. I was there in

04:02.894 --> 04:09.665
the greatest spectacle in the world, I guess. 
There were ships as far as you could see in any

04:10.205 --> 04:18.458
direction, most of them flying barrage balloons. 
There was still the firing from our warships, our

04:20.176 --> 04:32.875
destroyers against shore batteries off Omaha 
Beach. There were the landing parties going in.

04:38.383 --> 04:46.675
There was the overhead cover during the daylight 
hours from the American and British aircraft.

04:49.279 --> 04:49.980
At dusk, You could look in one direction and see 
airplanes returning to England and the other

04:50.247 --> 05:00.817
direction see the German planes coming in, dive 
bombers, that sort of thing. They dominated the

05:01.438 --> 05:03.180
scene at night. And the British and American 
planes dominated the daylight hours.

05:13.570 --> 05:16.913
But it was one more spectacle.

05:21.871 --> 05:26.175
And how many men did you have on your Liberty ship? 
Well, there were two batteries on there, so

05:26.195 --> 05:31.040
there'd be about 250 men. And you were waiting to go 
ashore after the second wave then? That's right.

05:37.406 --> 05:38.848
First the infantry, and then you? Well, the first 
two divisions were assault troops. These were the

05:44.113 --> 05:51.000
1st and 9th Division of the 5th Corps, and the 2nd 
Division was follow-up troops. So the 2nd

05:52.094 --> 06:06.635
Division landed on B-plus-1 infantry artillery, 
went between the 1st and 9th Divisions and

05:52.094 --> 06:06.635
attacked to the south. And at that time, the 1st and 
9th Divisions had won the battle of resistance of

06:08.979 --> 06:17.832
the troops were stationed in that area, there 
wasn't really anything much between us and Berlin

06:18.959 --> 06:25.388
of any great organized bases. So our initial, 
initially we had no resistance, but very soon the

06:25.448 --> 06:37.845
Germans threw in reinforcements, attacked us 
from the flank, We got strung out about nine miles

06:38.956 --> 06:45.025
beyond the 1st and 9th Divisions, so pretty well 
along the flanks. Our 38th Infantry Regiment took

06:45.605 --> 06:58.784
very heavy casualties, and we had to pull back and 
consolidate positions from the dominant

06:45.605 --> 06:58.784
terrain, which was a hill 192 meters high. It's 
called Hill 192 that's overlooking St. Louis. So

07:05.133 --> 07:08.878
we pulled back and consolidated positions, held 
in that position for six weeks while the supplies

07:10.664 --> 07:17.391
caught up and built up for a further attack. Are you 
under Bradley then? Yes, we were under Bradley,

07:21.034 --> 07:26.900
who later of course was given an army group. He was 
Corps Commander at that time as I recall.

07:33.587 --> 07:37.431
Patton was building up for the breakout troops, of 
course, after the Battle of St. Louis.

07:44.876 --> 08:03.840
Patton took his armored divisions and made the 
famous raids on down into southern France and

07:44.876 --> 08:03.840
bottled up German troops into some of the seaport 
areas and ran wild for a while after he broke

07:44.876 --> 08:03.840
through the primary resistance right there.

08:06.622 --> 08:15.595
But we sat in one position for six weeks after we got 
in there and pulled back while there was a build up

08:06.622 --> 08:15.595
of supplies and additional troops. We were about 
nine miles in from the beach. In other words, you

08:22.085 --> 08:24.248
went in on D plus one then? D plus one. Did you feel 
that you were part of a great historical

08:27.532 --> 08:35.464
event? I suppose so. Our troops had been training 
for this for a long time. We were ready to engage in

08:45.614 --> 08:47.757
combat. We were confident, professional 
soldiers at that time.

08:57.312 --> 08:59.896
That didn't mean we weren't scared, you know. We 
weren't insane when we got into shelling and

09:03.254 --> 09:05.477
bombings and all. We suffered fear, of course, but 
discipline has to overcome that to accomplish

09:05.938 --> 09:12.247
your mission. What did you think of your 
commanding officer and the way that the unit was

09:12.267 --> 09:20.539
run, the quality of the officers in charge?

09:24.165 --> 09:31.776
Well, we had a West Point Lieutenant Colonel 
commanding the battalion at that time. He wasn't

09:34.338 --> 09:36.061
anything too great. The executive officer was an

09:37.382 --> 09:50.441
ROTC graduate from Oklahoma State University 
named Alvin Mullenro.

09:54.027 --> 10:02.539
I can't even remember the name of the West Point 
officer that commanded it, but

09:54.027 --> 10:02.539
he was wounded. in the breakout up on this hill 192 
where we had such a hell of a fight to get it back

10:03.920 --> 10:17.218
after we first had it with no resistance whatever 
and evacuated. Why'd you evacuate this strategic

10:19.441 --> 10:22.566
location? They were taken back to England. They 
were taken to the beach and through medical

10:25.390 --> 10:31.378
evacuation taken back to England. trips that were 
faring, ships that were faring troops over.

10:40.242 --> 10:55.965
So

10:40.242 --> 10:55.965
we didn't think that is a general officer corps, 
we're not

10:40.242 --> 10:55.965
extremely respectful of that commander.

10:58.509 --> 10:59.290
Al Mudrow was, I'd have to say, some improvement.

11:09.509 --> 11:21.684
It could be that, of course, nearly all of us in the 
battalion by that time had gotten commissions

11:09.509 --> 11:21.684
through ROTC, and I guess we were glad to see one of 
the ROTC graduates get in command.

11:25.148 --> 11:29.614
Oh, he was a commander of the battalion for the rest 
of the 279 days that I was in combat. I still see him

11:35.434 --> 11:36.776
occasionally. He's moved from Oklahoma to 
Brownfield, Texas out west of Lubbock, and is a

11:36.876 --> 11:46.891
large farmer out there. We respected him.

11:53.928 --> 12:00.598
How can you continue the war after the hill and did 
you continue your sweep eastward? Well at Hill

12:01.599 --> 12:07.047
192, we had one heck of a fight getting that back. It 
was highly fortified. We were looking forward to

12:08.489 --> 12:19.024
getting that as an observation post to continue 
the attack, but when we did finally take it, very

12:20.287 --> 12:32.780
ironical that it provided very good observation 
all the way back to Omaha Beach, but the

12:20.287 --> 12:32.780
observation to the south and east wasn't any good 
at all. It was too heavily wooded on those slopes,

12:32.820 --> 12:37.525
so it really wasn't. We had to rely on our light 
aviation for observation more. Then we got

12:45.373 --> 12:46.834
diverted All the way down, they sent three 
divisions down to try to take the port of Brest in

12:47.354 --> 12:54.681
southern France. And this was, the Allies needed a 
seaport. When was this? Oh gosh, I don't know. It

13:07.492 --> 13:11.496
must have been about August. I think that was about 
eight weeks after we landed.

13:18.117 --> 13:46.926
six weeks and right after Patton broke through he 
you know went around all down in southern France

13:18.117 --> 13:46.926
and just bottled up and bypassed German troops and 
assembled in several seaports along the way which

13:18.117 --> 13:46.926
was of course very good strategy for them because 
these seaports had great tactical importance at

13:18.117 --> 13:46.926
that time we were loading off loading all supplies 
just from temporary port facilities So we needed a

13:47.547 --> 13:49.909
major C4. I believe the high command believed that 
if we had a big show of force at Brest that the

13:52.291 --> 14:00.479
Germans would surrender.

14:03.082 --> 14:05.564
But we got down there and got into a hell of a fight.

14:08.366 --> 14:16.474
Very ironical that the only allied troops down 
around Brest when we got there with a whole corps,

14:08.366 --> 14:16.474
three divisions, was one tank destroyer 
battalion. That's all there were, didn't they?

14:21.170 --> 14:21.911
Allied troops.

14:24.694 --> 14:34.326
Well, instead of surrendering, the Germans were, 
we found out later, were under direct orders from

14:24.694 --> 14:34.326
Hitler to hold out till the death. So we got in a 
tremendous fight and fought hard for a month

14:35.908 --> 14:41.474
before we took Brest. And after Brest fell, it was 
not useful, never was used Germans did a fantastic

14:47.757 --> 14:54.304
job of demolition of all the port facilities. They 
used it and then destroyed it. That's right. You

14:57.487 --> 15:10.881
know they had vast submarine pans, reinforced 
concrete 15 feet thick or some fantastic amount

14:57.487 --> 15:10.881
that was really bomb proof. Had railroad tunnels 
around where they were absolutely invulnerable

15:10.901 --> 15:17.528
to artillery fire and all. very difficult to take 
this interior city of Brest.

15:27.165 --> 15:28.427
And the... Fairly high casualties. The artillery 
had a tremendous amount to do because rather than

15:33.535 --> 15:45.253
frontal attacks on the fortress Brest, interior 
Brest, tremendous amount of artillery fire and

15:33.535 --> 15:45.253
bombing were used. To sort of polarize them into 
submission? Right, but finally there was finally

15:52.271 --> 16:10.169
there was street by street fighting to finally 
take breast and you know you couldn't go down the

15:52.271 --> 16:10.169
streets at all because the streets were commanded 
by German machine gun and artillery fire all the

15:52.271 --> 16:10.169
way down the streets. So the infantry developed a 
new tactic They used satchel charges to just blow

16:14.562 --> 16:20.589
holes through the walls of buildings, one 
building after another. What kind of charges?

16:22.010 --> 16:23.592
Satchel charges. These are charges that are made 
up in like a little satchel that a person would use.

16:30.820 --> 16:35.566
And they'd be put against the wall and lighted with 
a fuse. And they are concentrated charges that

16:35.706 --> 16:39.730
blow a hole in a wall. So the engineer troops did 
that. so the infantry could progress down the

16:44.650 --> 16:53.442
interior of the blocks and didn't have to get 
exposed out on the streets.

16:53.462 --> 16:58.629
So after Brest fell- Were there many German 
prisoners? I believe that the prisoners were

16:59.791 --> 17:09.865
55,000 taken out of there, so they had a tremendous 
number of troops in the fortress of Brest. A lot of

17:10.908 --> 17:15.993
them were support troops and that's where we found 
out they had a good many women. Men as old as 70 years

17:17.575 --> 17:22.600
old that were serving in the German army. That 
early? That old. But I mean that early in the war I

17:27.385 --> 17:38.856
knew that Hitler committed a number of elderly 
people and a number of very young people, but I was

17:27.385 --> 17:38.856
under the opinion that that was like January of 45 
and and they had 70 year old men. They were Germans

17:42.393 --> 17:45.779
or were they French? They were German, but they 
were doing the support bit, the finance, the

17:45.819 --> 17:53.152
quartermaster, the support. But you were 
surprised to see those people? We were surprised,

17:56.679 --> 18:01.367
but still they had enough fanatical SS troops 
around to make any of that kind of people fight.

18:08.519 --> 18:13.368
Because they were more afraid of their own troops 
than they were of us. Once they got committed to

18:13.388 --> 18:21.364
front lines, there's no question that the 
fanatical troops of the Germans kept them

18:13.388 --> 18:21.364
fighting. Were you part then of taking the 
prisoners of war, or did you watch them march out,

18:23.909 --> 18:29.555
or how did that work? Not directly. Our artillery 
would be a little bit further down. Of course we

18:34.200 --> 18:44.992
watched them march out, sure, but as far as being 
directly involved, our artillery battalion of

18:34.200 --> 18:44.992
general support nature was not that close. Where 
were you? Were you a couple of miles behind the

18:46.894 --> 18:49.637
infantry troops? Yes. In a sacred location? Yes, 
of course always the artillery headquarters

18:53.761 --> 19:03.915
would be stationed beyond small arms fire front 
lines. Of course now we don't talk very much about

19:03.935 --> 19:12.366
front lines, but in those days they were front 
lines fairly well established. So they, we would

19:14.028 --> 19:21.338
tend to try to get the headquarters far enough back 
to avoid vulnerability from small arms fire or

19:22.094 --> 19:26.041
mortar fire. So usually they were a couple of miles 
at least. And you wanted to be close enough so you

19:31.250 --> 19:35.236
could be called in. Well, with a forward movement, 
of course you want to be stationed as far forward as

19:35.577 --> 19:47.477
you can to avoid having to displace any more than 
you have to.

19:48.706 --> 20:02.180
We actually kept our headquarters in the same 
location for the whole month because we were

19:48.706 --> 20:02.180
within range of anywhere in that whole Brest city 
complex from the one position we occupied.

20:09.167 --> 20:16.975
It was the strangest thing in the world that after 
Brest fell we were 800 miles from the front lines.

20:17.309 --> 20:18.570
We turned on the lights.

20:21.213 --> 20:26.018
It's just like being in the communication zone 
rather than in the combat zone. We was far away. So

20:27.079 --> 20:31.383
our next displacement was 800 miles clearing to 
Germany.

20:34.506 --> 20:36.448
And when was that? Was that before the Battle of the 
Bulge? Oh, sure. It was well before the Battle of

20:39.511 --> 20:41.753
the Bulge. So it would have been in October, 
November, I'd say. Or 44. Probably late October

20:46.942 --> 20:51.007
because I believe we were at Lausfeld, Germany.

20:56.993 --> 21:05.563
And we were occupying the positions which we 
occupied for about six weeks and were later

20:56.993 --> 21:05.563
displaced by the 106th Division. Moved directly 
from Boston and replaced us position for position

21:07.145 --> 21:16.155
when we were pulled out. and put into an attack on 
the Rohrer River dams. Can you tell me about that?

21:23.628 --> 21:37.848
Well, we had a very thin position in the Snee Eifel, 
the snow mountain area of Germany, considered to

21:23.628 --> 21:37.848
be an unlikely attack spot. We were occupying 
27,000 square miles, I mean 27,000 yards of front.

21:45.548 --> 21:52.122
way overextended for an infantry division.

21:53.164 --> 21:59.156
Some of, a lot of the territory was covered just by 
patrols, not any troops stationed in it at all. And

22:00.539 --> 22:03.264
that's where the Germans hit on the Battle of the 
Bulge. We had just two or three days before, had

22:06.102 --> 22:15.797
been pulled out and committed on an attack on the 
Rohwer River dams to try to prevent the Germans

22:06.102 --> 22:15.797
from blowing those up and flooding the Rohwer 
River. So in the Battle of the Bulge, the 106th

22:17.880 --> 22:26.394
Division that replaced us was captured almost 
intact. It hit right through the positions where

22:26.414 --> 22:28.557
we were. It's very strange that Some of the 
activities we had observed and reported back,

22:33.203 --> 22:44.495
there seemed to be a lot of digging of potatoes and 
that sort of thing that we'd observed from our

22:33.203 --> 22:44.495
observation posts. We know now, of course, and 
knew later, is Germans were removing their

22:45.195 --> 22:50.781
minefields and getting ready to attack. There was 
a stretch of very bad weather, you see, during that

22:52.102 --> 22:59.430
covered the German massing of troops in their 
attack. I always wonder whether a seasoned

23:01.334 --> 23:24.025
division like us would have been able to hold them 
because there was only one or two main roads coming

23:01.334 --> 23:24.025
into our whole division area, whether with 
artillery fire and with experienced resistance,

23:01.334 --> 23:24.025
whether we'd have been able to hold the attack 
right there. Kind of like to believe that we could

23:24.045 --> 23:27.730
have, but anyhow, The first we knew about it is that 
the first troops of our division that felt the

23:29.279 --> 23:46.402
attack was a quartermaster company of our 
division, so they came in and hit our division

23:29.279 --> 23:46.402
right in the rear, absolutely.

23:48.685 --> 23:58.037
Our people at our airfield for our little Leber 
Cousins plane woke up one morning with the German

23:48.685 --> 23:58.037
tanks overlooking the field. But it's very 
strange that the German tanks were committed

23:58.827 --> 24:03.253
without very much infantry. And all of our 
aviation personnel were able to walk away from

24:04.234 --> 24:10.162
there without any of them getting captured. 
Because the Germans didn't have infantry along

24:11.464 --> 24:16.551
with their tanks. Is this because they were 
probably short of manpower? I think they probably

24:19.134 --> 24:20.476
were. But anyway, our

24:26.873 --> 24:34.359
particular artillery battalion turned the guns 
180 degrees around. So we were attacking and so the

24:34.700 --> 24:42.827
threat was clear in the rear of the battalion. And 
our howitzers were turned around 180 degrees and

24:44.328 --> 24:56.138
they were registered by the division artillery S3 
looking out of his third-story window in a

24:56.236 --> 25:09.868
building because the German troops got within 
one-half mile of our division headquarters, our

24:56.236 --> 25:09.868
division artillery headquarters, so our pouches 
were turned around. You must have been under

25:10.389 --> 25:13.496
intense fire then, weren't you? No, we really 
weren't. The Germans never knew that that's where

25:14.832 --> 25:18.618
the division headquarters were. They could 
easily have taken division headquarters or

25:18.638 --> 25:26.209
division artillery at that time, but we did not 
feel any of their fire at all. They just passed you

25:27.671 --> 25:29.874
and just kept moving? That's right. You were sort 
of a pocket within their advance? Actually our

25:35.182 --> 25:39.608
division

25:40.837 --> 25:46.625
was on, as I recall, the northern side of the 
breakthrough area. We're mighty proud of the fact

25:46.765 --> 25:53.214
that they never widened the breakthrough area at 
all. Our division was attacked by five different

25:54.416 --> 26:02.107
German divisions as they would hit our division, 
but then displaced to the west. So they displaced,

26:03.849 --> 26:07.975
gosh, I guess 100 miles to the west. but they never 
widened that area, so they never got but one real

26:08.073 --> 26:15.643
main supply route. So when the weather cleared, of 
course our Air Force really took care of their

26:15.663 --> 26:28.901
supply trains and all the vehicles they had along 
that main supply route.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.545
And we think that we were part of the reason for 
that. Our division got reinforced by a tank

26:31.625 --> 26:37.793
battalion that had been on rest leave somewhere, 
was put right into a tank destroyer battalion, not

26:38.144 --> 26:45.411
tank battalion. We had a tank destroyer battalion 
attached to our fire direction center. Our

26:52.659 --> 27:02.509
ammunition train, going back to the ammunition 
dump, captured some German parachute troops.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.953
They had a parachute troop landing in support of 
this, but the high winds scattered them out and

27:07.355 --> 27:14.905
they never were able to assemble and become an 
effective fighting force. So they hit in our rear

27:16.006 --> 27:22.956
area, but never created as much havoc. The biggest 
threat we had during this time was German soldiers

27:23.176 --> 27:34.531
in American uniforms using American vehicles. So 
this was a threat. and all the confusion and

27:36.278 --> 27:38.241
everything. And of course they soon learned the 
sign and countersign that we had where we'd

27:39.764 --> 27:48.698
challenge people. With American ingenuity, they 
started asking them things like, who won the World

27:50.461 --> 27:56.792
Series? Things like that that any American 
soldier would know, but the Germans wouldn't

27:56.832 --> 28:03.062
know. the way some of them, of course many of them 
spoke just as good English as our troops. That was a

28:10.213 --> 28:15.041
big threat, all right, posing as American 
soldiers, being German soldiers.

28:18.647 --> 28:29.826
During this battle, our artillery, we darn near 
wore out our howitzers, and we really had a lot of

28:18.647 --> 28:29.826
artillery fire, and of course Just before 
daylight every day, we would mass fire on all of the

28:32.033 --> 28:39.605
most logical assembly points. Of course, 
artillery was a mighty big factor in this. Then

28:43.932 --> 28:46.556
again, our experience- Especially before the 
weather cleared. Yeah, and our experienced

28:46.997 --> 28:54.268
infantry troops in these little towns with the 
narrow streets were able to be in the basement of

28:46.997 --> 28:54.268
these towns. And as I remember, one of our infantry 
regiments, knocked out 68 German tanks just going

29:00.485 --> 29:29.614
down the streets of narrow town because they they 
could do it with bazooka fire with uh with satchel

29:00.485 --> 29:29.614
charges that sort of thing because of course a tank 
without infantry support the tankers are pretty

29:00.485 --> 29:29.614
blind and if you're in the basement of buildings on 
narrow streets where you sure have good shots of

29:00.485 --> 29:29.614
tanks but

29:00.485 --> 29:29.614
one of our Infantry regiments really took care of a 
lot of those tanks just by themselves.

29:39.155 --> 29:47.950
I'd say that was the most glorious contribution 
that the 2nd Infantry Division made in all of World

29:39.155 --> 29:47.950
War II, right there in the Battle of the Bulge. Of 
course that was mid-December of 1944. Were you and

29:55.430 --> 29:59.295
your colleagues pretty surprised about the 
German attack? Did you think that the Germans were

29:59.596 --> 30:04.222
fairly well beat? No, I don't think we had a very 
good perception of that. We didn't know that much

30:06.885 --> 30:08.908
about the big picture.

30:12.233 --> 30:20.003
The Germans we'd been up against all along the way 
were damn good fighters, so we had tremendous

30:12.233 --> 30:20.003
respect for them. What do you mean they were 
excellent fighters? In what way? Well, they were

30:26.079 --> 30:27.581
well trained. The individual soldiers were well 
disciplined, well trained, and many of them just

30:27.641 --> 30:37.093
absolutely fanatical.

30:40.057 --> 30:47.026
They were skillful, had pretty darn good 
equipment.

30:47.046 --> 30:51.812
Their 88 and their machine pistols were 
tremendous weapons. We had a lot of respect for

30:55.121 --> 30:56.703
them, sure.

31:00.267 --> 31:17.310
We were very surprised about the attack through 
that particular area, because we'd been

31:00.267 --> 31:17.310
occupying those spots for a long time, and there'd 
been almost no activity, so it was considered to be

31:00.267 --> 31:17.310
a very quiet area of the front, an unlikely area for 
any kind of attack. So I'd have to say that the

31:19.788 --> 31:24.837
German tactics in using that were superb.
