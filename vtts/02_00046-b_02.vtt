James Pappas is here today and he's thrilled to 
death that he's here. In fact, on spring break, he

00:05.454 --> 00:10.220
wanted to stay up here. He loves A&M. But I think 
they need to intermingle

00:12.162 --> 00:24.056
a little bit more with the former students because 
I'm here on this Saul Ross reunion. I'm

00:24.457 --> 00:25.998
disappointed in the turnout. And I don't know why. 
We talked about it last night. Like you, they asked

00:32.016 --> 00:39.544
me at the hospitality room, what can we do to get 
more people involved? I don't know. But I think the

00:41.045 --> 00:49.014
administration needs to get out into the field a 
little bit more instead of staying here. And Ray

00:49.154 --> 00:53.258
Bowen has done a great job, outstanding job. I'll 
do whatever Ray Bowen wants to do. I'll support him

00:57.042 --> 00:59.906
and always have and always will. He's such a fine 
person. But I think they need to get out and just

01:02.569 --> 01:09.677
socialize a little bit more, as we say, in quotes, 
socialize, you know. And to get the former

01:10.278 --> 01:23.194
students, because pretty soon my classmates like 
me are passing on and we need the younger group. If

01:25.790 --> 01:37.437
someone walked up to you and handed you a check for a 
million dollars with one condition on it, you must

01:25.790 --> 01:37.437
pass that check on to A&M. If you had the capability 
to make a major gift to A&M, for what purpose would

01:38.041 --> 01:43.690
you want that money used? Scholarships. For whom? 
For a deserving student. Now, I'm not going to set

01:51.422 --> 01:57.552
any parameters about IQs and SATs and stuff like 
that. Because there are a lot of deserving kids out

01:57.532 --> 02:06.348
there who don't have SAT over 1150 or 1200 but who 
deserve scholarships. How do you decide that they

02:06.469 --> 02:08.232
deserve it? How would you measure that deserving?

02:13.943 --> 02:14.764
By interview? by contact, by background checks on 
them, and I'm happy to say that my brothers and I

02:15.082 --> 02:27.601
have had a Presidential Endowed Scholarship for 
the last twenty years. Does it matter what the

02:29.043 --> 02:30.986
student majors in? It does not matter. It does not 
matter. Or whether it's he or she or where they're

02:33.870 --> 02:37.596
from? three, the last four we had were females. 
This one is a male, first male we had. And he's on the

02:44.685 --> 02:53.877
track team, he's a javelin thrower, and his grades 
are, he passes the marks and everything. And we're

02:54.558 --> 02:55.679
happy about that. I'm about through now, but I'm 
thinking about a few other things. Of all your

03:03.470 --> 03:07.735
Aggie memories, of what are you most proud?

03:10.583 --> 03:11.985
other than the fact that you came here. I came here 
and I graduated. Well I'm proud, I really am proud

03:16.391 --> 03:25.685
that A&M designated me as a distinguished student 
and distinguished alumni in 1996. That was the

03:25.905 --> 03:28.609
biggest surprise I've had about A&M. And that 
tells me A&M doesn't seek those with

03:31.977 --> 03:44.114
money resources or what. They're seeking a person 
who likes A&M, who will contribute to A&M, which I

03:44.474 --> 03:55.930
will do and have done.

03:55.910 --> 04:00.916
And also, when I captained the A&M basketball 
team, I was honored by that. I'm honored that I was

04:00.977 --> 04:13.573
the second and third president of the Texas, of the 
A&M's Letterman Association, helped build that,

04:00.977 --> 04:13.573
helped get that going back in the 70s. And I'm 
delighted that I went to A&M because it helped me

04:15.635 --> 04:20.061
become a general. A general's a general. And I had 
no idea when I came to A&M about even liking the

04:23.722 --> 04:30.312
military, but I was going to do it. And here, some 
40, 50 years later, I'm a general officer status,

04:31.254 --> 04:44.355
and it just makes me proud that A&M had all to do with 
it, to tell you the truth. Because A&M is looked

04:44.996 --> 04:47.820
upon throughout the world. as great leaders and 
great patriots. During World War II, we had 17,000

04:52.793 --> 04:55.417
officers. And I presume that you saw a number of 
Aggies in Europe during the war. I did. Oh, yeah. I

05:02.367 --> 05:03.449
saw a bunch. Did you, by chance, run into Earl 
Rutter during the war? No, sir, but I served under

05:06.533 --> 05:09.818
General Rutter in the reserve. He was commander of 
the 9th Division, and I was one of his battalion

05:09.918 --> 05:15.066
commanders. I commanded the artillery 
battalion. him and a great guy. His assistant was

05:22.137 --> 05:28.810
Graber Kidwell from Dallas and he was my artillery 
commander, General Kidwell. But General Rudder

05:29.852 --> 05:35.202
was down to earth, smart, let you do your job. He 
always said, You're the artillery man. Do your

05:40.120 --> 05:41.041
job. Do your work. Yes, sir, General. But, yeah, 
great guy. I've got only one more question I can

05:48.073 --> 05:50.177
think of. Have we left anything out that you want to 
be sure we include about you and A&M?

06:00.194 --> 06:03.639
Can't think of anything that, I think we covered it 
pretty well. You have covered it pretty well. Then

06:06.423 --> 06:11.430
the last question is, what feelings do you carry in 
your heart for Texas A&M today?

06:14.134 --> 06:15.016
You want me to cry? I can cry with A&M. I'm about to do 
it now. Great, great school.

06:29.303 --> 06:35.700
In my heart, A&M will stand with my father and 
mother. That's how strong I feel about A&M. Let's

06:40.313 --> 06:41.777
quit with that.
