WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:11.160
It was Ned, this is a date for you tonight at the 
party over at the judge's house. And so that was a

00:11.881 --> 00:15.948
very memorable singing cadet trip. I believe that 
was the sophomore spring semester that that

00:16.549 --> 00:24.161
happened. This is a note to the typist, an 
editorial note. If I'm not mistaken, this Mr.

00:32.887 --> 01:02.691
Smith or his brother came to the campus to try to 
lobby the board then called the board of directors

00:32.887 --> 01:02.691
to vote against coeducation and I with another 
young faculty member in history we took off our

00:32.887 --> 01:02.691
coats and ties so we might not be recognized very 
much and stood in the background as he met with what

00:32.887 --> 01:02.691
he called the leaders of the senior class in the 
hallway of the MSC on second floor straight above

01:03.110 --> 01:28.088
the check-in desk and as I recall he told them that 
he urged them to go and argue against co-education

01:03.110 --> 01:28.088
non-compulsory core higher admission 
requirements and so forth and he lost his audience

01:03.110 --> 01:28.088
though when he told the group that A&M was not 
teaching the practical things now. They weren't

01:31.846 --> 01:44.518
giving enough attention to the slide rule, to 
their verbs and their pronouns and their

01:31.846 --> 01:44.518
diagramming of sentences, and that you really 
didn't need any math beyond trigonometry. And as

01:45.819 --> 01:55.769
he was saying those things, we could see the look on 
the senior class members' faces like this old man

01:45.819 --> 01:55.769
has lost it. He's out of touch. and he asked the 
senior class president to go with him to join him in

01:57.734 --> 02:17.078
speaking against the changes, and the senior 
class president, whomever it was that year, stood

01:57.734 --> 02:17.078
up and identified himself and said, the senior 
class has not yet discussed these topics. No one,

02:17.859 --> 02:23.406
neither I nor anyone else, can speak for the senior 
class on these topics. They can speak as

02:23.746 --> 02:25.108
individuals. but you cannot argue that the senior 
class is for or against any of this. Well, as a

02:31.139 --> 02:35.685
result, there were almost no students that went 
with it. Back to singing cadets. Do you remember

02:36.706 --> 02:40.290
any... His grandson, T.M. Smith's grandson, was 
T.M. Smith III. He was a classmate of mine in Class

02:42.993 --> 02:45.176
63. During your singing cadet experience, do you 
remember any particularly proud moments? Oh,

02:51.920 --> 03:12.426
yes, yes, getting Mickey Mantle's signature and 
helping him walk downstairs as, you call it a prank

02:51.920 --> 03:12.426
if you want to, but as you know, the singing cadets 
were escorts to the Miss Teenage American pageant

02:51.920 --> 03:12.426
for a good number of years, and I made, I think, 
three of those pageants, and one of those

02:51.920 --> 03:12.426
pageants... The judges for the pageant, Mickey 
Mantle was a judge. This actress by the name of

03:20.392 --> 03:26.984
White, Betty White, Betty White was a judge. A guy 
named Al Ludden or something, Al Ludden maybe was a

03:27.004 --> 03:32.794
judge. I got all their signatures, and from the 
stage, the girls would come down these stairs, and

03:33.027 --> 03:54.047
the judges were up there, and during one of the 
rehearsals, Mickey Mantle was going to walk down

03:33.027 --> 03:54.047
these stairs, and I grabbed his arm and helped him 
down the stairs like I would one of the girls. Yeah,

03:54.547 --> 03:55.769
that was very memorable. And my last year in the 
cadets... I had laid out the one semester, so I

04:01.394 --> 04:15.995
actually graduated in January of 64 instead of May 
or June of 63 because of laying out that semester.

04:16.776 --> 04:26.490
And I guess it was that last semester in October of 
63,

04:28.158 --> 04:50.229
I was married and my wife got pregnant and we went to 
the Miss Teenage America pageant and the guy that

04:28.158 --> 04:50.229
was really producing the Miss Teenage America 
pageant was one of the big owners of Six Flags and a

04:28.158 --> 04:50.229
bunch of us went to Six Flags and my wife and I and 
with her pregnant we rode everything at Six Flags.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.671
I remember that very well. What moments of singing 
a special A&M song did you feel most proud? Where,

05:02.142 --> 05:04.025
when, or how? Well, you have to advance my career a 
long way. I was a dean of

05:09.054 --> 05:18.010
undergraduate affairs in the College of 
Engineering. Bob Boone could not make a

05:19.070 --> 05:23.014
commencement exercise. And Bob Boone called me 
and he said, you're leading commencement spirit

05:23.675 --> 05:27.879
of Aggieland. Can you do it? And I said, what a 
pleasure. Yes, I guess as far as a proud moment to be

05:31.683 --> 05:41.073
at commencement and do that for Bob Boone, who no 
one replaced Bob Boone, number one. But to do that

05:41.534 --> 05:44.757
was just most memorable. And, of course, you know, 
we always performed very, very strong patriotic

05:44.737 --> 05:58.337
and solid religious programs when I was in the 
cadets. And even after that, and I have made many of

05:58.457 --> 06:07.029
the spring concerts and gone to the stage when 
Boone would ask former cadets to come to the stage.

06:07.069 --> 06:09.613
So all of those were very, very... very, very 
special to me. But I think leading the crowd in the

06:14.617 --> 06:22.206
spirit of a commencement had to be very, very 
special. Did you get involved in any MSC

06:22.807 --> 06:25.210
activities? Yes, I participated again in the Ham 
Radio Club and three or four other committees

06:27.713 --> 06:35.602
within the MSC. I don't know that I can even tell you 
what all those committees were now. How many were

06:40.070 --> 06:43.375
in the Ham Radio Club in your years? Oh, goodness, 
maybe 20, 25 maybe. And I kept up with some of those

06:49.183 --> 06:50.845
guys. And where was your radio room? It was on the 
second floor of the MSC.

06:59.459 --> 07:18.970
little small small room that looked out on the 
front side of the student center had one little

06:59.459 --> 07:18.970
window that you could see out the front side and 
antenna was mounted up on the on the top of the

06:59.459 --> 07:18.970
building and we spent a lot of our time trying to get 
money to upgrade equipment But it was on the second

07:18.950 --> 07:20.674
floor. Have any idea how long that lasted? How many 
years? The radio club? It was in existence when I

07:26.065 --> 07:34.083
got there, and it was there when I left, and I 
don't... W5AC may still exist. I don't know. And

07:35.766 --> 07:38.933
you don't know whether it goes back to the 20s or 
not? I want to say that it goes way, way back, even to

07:39.487 --> 07:48.155
maybe the time when the first game was broadcast. I 
don't know whether there was an association or

07:48.295 --> 08:01.146
relationship between those two or not, but just 
the fact that it's W5AC tells you it's an old, old,

07:48.295 --> 08:01.146
old station because of the call letters. Number 
one, because it's just a two-call. And it's very

08:03.869 --> 08:06.011
early in the alphabet, AC. So W5AC was very, very 
early in the alphabet. owned in the Hound Radio

08:08.613 --> 08:10.476
community. Did you get involved in any local 
religious, did you attend? Yes, I attended church

08:14.221 --> 08:17.465
very religiously, Haskell. At Northgate? No, at 
Little Church of Christ over in Bryan. That's

08:23.414 --> 08:24.575
where I met my wife. And my wife was... working at 
what was then called the Texas A&M Press and it's

08:27.192 --> 08:34.382
what is called today the Printing Center. But they 
did everything, anything that was printed or

08:34.402 --> 08:54.128
published on the campus of A&M was done at the A&M 
Press and my wife is on the front page of the

08:34.402 --> 08:54.128
battalion fall of 1963 holding up Texas A&M 
University. That was when the name changed. In

08:57.416 --> 09:03.226
fact, my Aggie ring, Class of 63, reads A&M College 
of Texas. And you'll notice my Bachelor of Science

09:03.306 --> 09:08.235
diploma says Texas A&M University. So that's when 
it happened. I got caught by laying out that

09:10.886 --> 09:14.072
semester. I'm not an A&M College of Texas 
graduate. I'm a Texas A&M University graduate.

09:18.059 --> 09:18.279
All right. So you're in the Corps when you meet her. 
When y'all were courting, where would y'all go?

09:25.772 --> 09:26.534
Oh, gosh. Where would you go to eat? We would go to a 
place where First Federal Savings and Loans,

09:29.512 --> 09:35.344
First Federal Bank is now. That was the best place, 
I mean the highestfalutin place in town, if you

09:36.787 --> 09:48.432
will, and that was called,

09:36.787 --> 09:48.432
oh, goodness, Haskell. I'll think of it before the 
day is over. On down the road past there was, over on

09:52.167 --> 10:00.244
South College, was the Triangle and the Texan. And 
we could also go there at the Circle, which was at

10:01.266 --> 10:06.657
Northgate. There was a hamburger joint there on 
the circle. You could go there. There were two or

10:11.467 --> 10:14.573
three greasy spoons at Northgate. Nothing like 
what's there now, but two or three little old cafes

10:14.913 --> 10:18.420
there. You could go there, but I didn't take Miss 
Walton there very often when we were recording. If

10:24.793 --> 10:28.240
we went to a movie, we went to... a Bryan movie. The 
campus was a little bit more rowdy, so I wouldn't

10:30.010 --> 10:33.516
take it. I said I wouldn't take it. We typically did 
not go there. And so that was pretty much it. Being

10:41.868 --> 10:46.255
church crash members, you all didn't go out and do 
wild drinking. No, no drinking and no dancing. Not

10:52.504 --> 10:54.467
that we had anything against dancing, either one. 
I was just never were much dancers. It was fairly

10:58.190 --> 11:00.273
laid back. I remember before we married in 
December of what would, when I was in the core of

11:00.973 --> 11:11.766
December of my senior years when we married. And 
then I graduated in, that would be December of 62. I

11:19.616 --> 11:24.602
graduated in January of 64, which is just a little 
over a year after that. And where did y'all live

11:25.055 --> 11:27.300
then? Well, now, just before, I was in dorm two when 
we got married, and she lived over on Ash Street in

11:27.541 --> 11:41.612
College Station, just over at what we call the 
Eastgate area. And she and her mother would make

11:41.828 --> 11:49.778
cakes and pies and coffee and what have you. And 
Miss Walton would, she was a Douglas, Etta

11:49.838 --> 12:04.798
Douglas, Etta would call the guard room and one of 
the fish would come up to my room and say, Mr.

11:49.838 --> 12:04.798
Walton, sir, the lady is on the phone. We didn't 
have phones in the rooms those days. I'd go down to

12:07.081 --> 12:11.226
the dorm room, and I'd call her, and she'd say, hey, 
I got a pie made, or I got some coffee made. Would you

12:11.246 --> 12:12.207
like to come over? And I would. We would go over and 
visit with her. And when we married, this is a long

12:16.873 --> 12:31.591
story, and I guess maybe I can tell you the 
shortened version and see what you think about it

12:16.873 --> 12:31.591
as far as the appropriateness is concerned. When I 
took my physical exam... for advanced contract,

12:35.018 --> 12:40.047
to get a military advanced contract. I failed the 
physical. And it was, I thought they were picking

12:42.231 --> 12:46.099
on me because I failed it. And the reason I failed it 
is because of the little accident that I'd had as a

12:46.119 --> 12:50.387
freshman. And I had a minor back injury. I mean, it 
wasn't bad, but minor back injury. I just

12:55.623 --> 13:04.059
literally begged them to let me be examined again, 
that I really wanted the advance contract. But in

13:05.962 --> 13:10.911
an interim period of time, there was a professor of 
civil engineering named Jim Bob Beatty. And Jim

13:12.014 --> 13:18.205
Bob Beatty taught water, sewer, and sanitation. 
And the Medical Service Corps was looking for

13:19.467 --> 13:31.758
civil engineering graduates to go into the 
Medical Service Corps to run water systems,

13:19.467 --> 13:31.758
sanitation systems, sewer systems, and what have 
you. And those were what were called direct

13:32.801 --> 13:35.788
commissions. And they would just take you right 
straight as a BS graduate. And what was not only so

13:43.367 --> 13:53.078
great about it, if you really qualified what they 
were looking for, you got to go in as a first

13:43.367 --> 13:53.078
lieutenant rather than a second lieutenant, just 
like the vets did. So Jim Bob Beatty was a very, he

13:53.098 --> 14:02.029
was a special prof. Jim Beatty and I communicated 
very well. I had told him about not passing my

14:02.009 --> 14:08.296
physical and didn't know what I was going to do, and 
he said, well, I'll tell you what you do. You just

14:08.336 --> 14:15.183
take some specialization in sanitation above and 
beyond the basic water and sewer, and I know how to

14:08.336 --> 14:15.183
help you. And sure enough, he did. He got me in 
communication with the Medical Service Corps,

14:16.424 --> 14:23.632
and it was kind of left at, yeah, you get your BS 
degree and you have these courses. We'll take you.

14:24.273 --> 14:24.953
We need you. And so I was preparing to do that, as a 
matter of fact, and... Then I got married, and when

14:30.832 --> 14:40.266
I got married, Colonel Joe Davis was a commandant, 
and I went over and I talked to him. I said, you know,

14:40.326 --> 14:58.493
I really don't know how to say this, don't know what 
to say, but you know the problem that I've had on

14:40.326 --> 14:58.493
getting my reexamination and what have you, and I 
said, I have maybe an opportunity to go into the

14:40.326 --> 14:58.493
medical service corps when I graduate.

14:59.367 --> 15:01.552
What should I do? They said, well, what are your 
other plans? Well, I'm going to get married, you

15:03.417 --> 15:07.046
know, in December. And he said, well, he said, the 
only smart thing for you to do is stay drilling

15:07.306 --> 15:14.383
ceremonies in the Corps and forget about advanced 
contract. I mean, you already got it. I mean, you

15:15.366 --> 15:17.190
know, goodness, go for it. So I got married, and I 
stayed through that semester in the Corps, and I

15:17.778 --> 15:27.872
became a civilian student the last part of my 
senior year. So I was in the Corps, out of the Corps,

15:27.932 --> 15:31.637
in the Corps, and out of the Corps again. And to make 
a long story short, my wife and I were married seven

15:32.438 --> 15:39.148
months when she got pregnant. Okay? Now, this 
brings up another little problem of now what do you

15:40.019 --> 15:43.784
do? And by the way, you asked me what started it. 
Where did you live? We lived over on Eccles Street

15:47.869 --> 15:58.103
in a garage apartment and moved from Eccles Street 
into Hensel Apartments, Married Student

15:47.869 --> 15:58.103
Housing. Do you remember what did Hensel cost 
then? $60. And that included all utilities and

16:02.227 --> 16:05.692
everything, $60. And where did you all acquire the 
vast amount of furniture that it must have been?

16:09.959 --> 16:17.811
Oh, we got it from my mother, her mother and dad, my 
brother, my sister, wherever we could find

16:09.959 --> 16:17.811
something. That's the only thing. Castoffs. 
Castoffs. Anyway, I ended up dropping out as a core

16:20.275 --> 16:25.703
student there. And we lived there. And like I say, 
we were married seven months. She got pregnant.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.075
When I graduated medical service corps, do you 
want me? We don't want married men. And we

16:35.739 --> 16:38.123
certainly don't want a married man that's got a 
pregnant wife. So I set it out, Haskell. And you

16:44.195 --> 16:46.280
were anxious to... Yes, what I really thought I was 
going towards, so I set it out. No draft, no

16:50.850 --> 16:52.875
nothing. I mean, I was just sitting there, and the 
only official record that was on file anywhere is

16:52.915 --> 17:01.815
that I had not passed the physical for my advance 
contracts, and they left me alone. Meanwhile,

17:01.795 --> 17:03.958
your grades are getting better. Oh, absolutely. 
I'm studying with these Army and Air Force

17:05.540 --> 17:14.552
officers, Captain Eads and Major Davis and 
Captain Custer, and all my grades are getting

17:05.540 --> 17:14.552
better and better. I'm making better and better 
impressions on my profs. You know, Walton may

17:18.096 --> 17:20.460
amount to something someday. If you were 
summarizing that for a student today, what were

17:22.182 --> 17:29.912
the secrets of the improvement of your work? 
Haskell, I think, you know, we can make excuses,

17:31.310 --> 17:40.865
you know, and I've always had a, you know, 
propensity to make an excuse when I really needed

17:31.310 --> 17:40.865
to. I could say very poor preparation to begin 
with. I had no study skills. I was the auditorium of

17:45.392 --> 17:48.357
a class of 20 kids, like, big deal. You know, that 
was because the other 19, well, you know how that

17:48.809 --> 17:53.716
goes. I was not prepared at all for those first 
couple of years. And it was a real, I mean, it was

17:57.662 --> 18:02.970
just really tough to hang in. And Haskell, they 
weeded us, they weeded students out in those days.

18:07.938 --> 18:13.065
I'm sorry, you know, my core outfit probably 
started out with 40 freshmen. It was probably 10 or

18:13.105 --> 18:16.150
12 of those kids that graduated, period. And only 
two or three of those in engineering. So it was a

18:19.452 --> 18:23.303
terrible thing to get through it to begin with. So 
there was a poor preparation, but I had no study

18:23.624 --> 18:29.801
skills, absolutely none whatsoever. Did anybody 
tell you? to improve your study skills, or did you

18:32.498 --> 18:35.822
just graduate? No, I don't think so. I think that 
was something that you just, after a while, you

18:36.963 --> 18:45.053
assimilated and through a process of osmosis, 
maybe you just got better. And I'm going to say, in

18:45.333 --> 18:54.844
all seriousness, those three officers that I've 
called by name helped me develop a discipline I

18:55.533 --> 18:59.257
mean, they would say, at this time every day, this 
is what we're going to do. And I had one of those guys

19:00.258 --> 19:08.608
typically as a lab partner in almost all of my later 
junior and all of my senior classes. And, yeah,

19:08.728 --> 19:11.411
things just improved drastically. And even when 
we went to Junction for summer surveying camp,

19:12.272 --> 19:18.859
those three guys and I were on a four-man team at 
Junction. Describe Junction. junction server.

19:21.629 --> 19:21.889
Brutal. You're talking about Bear Bryant and his 
football players out there. Listen, we didn't

19:25.559 --> 19:26.802
have any better. It was brutal. We got up at 
daylight. Y'all were out there after Yeah, we were

19:31.544 --> 19:38.513
out there after the Bryant Saga, but there were two 
groups that went to Junction every summer. One

19:38.713 --> 19:58.217
group, the geology students, they went out there 
for looking at formations and cracked rocks and

19:38.713 --> 19:58.217
all that sort of thing that they do, and we went out 
to do surveying and stream gauging and to run road

19:38.713 --> 19:58.217
routes up the side of those little hills out there 
around Junction. About how many were in your

19:58.237 --> 19:59.779
group? Oh, goodness, we probably had 40 or 50, 
maybe, at Junction in civil engineering. And

20:07.527 --> 20:10.230
these are primarily sophomores to be? No, no, 
these are seniors to be, are already deep into

20:10.511 --> 20:16.217
their senior year. I postponed mine to that summer 
after my, quote, senior year. I went in the summer

20:22.183 --> 20:24.866
of 63, I believe it was. Well, no, it wasn't because 
I was married. Who was in charge? Uncle Ed

20:28.550 --> 20:29.631
Harrington. I don't know if you remember Ed 
Harrington or not, and Joe Orr, and Bob Olson. What

20:37.945 --> 20:39.928
was the described typical routine? Oh, and the guy 
that ran Junction for the freshmen out there.

20:44.456 --> 20:49.864
Well, see, there were those two groups, but they 
had a freshman program at Junction where I don't

20:50.823 --> 21:06.771
know if that was a beginning of fish camp or what, 
but the kids would go out there and they'd take

20:50.823 --> 21:06.771
freshman English, freshman history maybe, and 
Kutash, D. Kutash was kind of running the

20:50.823 --> 21:06.771
operations of the university at that time. That's 
K-U-T-A-S-H. That sounds close, yes. I think

21:10.718 --> 21:11.459
that's right. Yeah, Kutash, D. Kutash's. It went 
like this. The civil engineering students were

21:16.936 --> 21:22.144
dorm tent advisors. The buildings out there were 
half walls and roll-up tents on the outside, and

21:22.524 --> 21:33.520
they would have 15 or 20, 24 freshmen or something, 
and one civil engineering student was the... was

21:33.500 --> 21:37.087
the dorm master, if you would, for all those 
students. And we didn't interact with them

21:37.107 --> 21:40.093
educationally or anything. We just made sure that 
they went to bed at night and got up the next

21:40.113 --> 21:43.460
morning. Well, we got up at daylight every 
morning, went to chow, and hit the classroom for a

21:47.202 --> 21:52.247
brief introduction of what we were going to do that 
day. And we surveyed or streamgaged all day until 5

21:52.267 --> 21:55.590
o'clock. And we'd come in high o'clock, 
blistered, hot, sweaty, chased a few jackrabbits

21:55.990 --> 22:01.996
probably in the process. We'd come back in, go 
through a debriefing, and we would draw up our

22:02.036 --> 22:10.184
surveys and what have you. It was a tremendous 
experience, really hands-on experience of what a

22:15.957 --> 22:18.907
In effect, civil engineers became surveyors in 
those days. You could register as a surveyor by

22:18.927 --> 22:21.776
having a civil engineering degree. As you look 
back on it now, Was it a good sound? Absolutely. I

22:28.466 --> 22:31.209
wish that they still did something similar to 
that. If it's not a surveying camp, some type of a

22:31.990 --> 22:42.301
summer practicum where you get out and get your 
feet hot and sweaty and dirty and you learn some

22:31.990 --> 22:42.301
real practical things. And we used calculators 
back in those days. You remember the old Monroe?

22:46.126 --> 22:47.407
You remember the name Monroe? And what was the 
other name of those calculators? But you would

22:51.532 --> 22:54.655
input and you'd have to crank it, you know? to get 
the decimal and the carrying your tens forward.

23:00.888 --> 23:03.332
Those were the calculators that we had in those 
days. The University of Missouri has operated

23:03.672 --> 23:09.400
something like that, particularly for geology 
and the engineers. They own about 5,000 acres

23:09.941 --> 23:16.930
about five miles outside Lander, Wyoming. And can 
you imagine how much fun it is to spend six weeks in

23:17.753 --> 23:22.045
Wyoming? Yes. I was really just going to see A&M 
give up Junction and let it go to Tech. I really was.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.907
I was just heartbroken when that happened. awful 
blunder. That Llano River and the pecan trees down

23:32.251 --> 23:40.885
there in those bottoms there at Junction where we 
had that camp was just magnificent. I still have

23:40.925 --> 23:42.387
very vivid memories. And swimming in those holes 
in the Llano. Oh, I can remember that. What I've

23:46.673 --> 23:52.482
learned so far, correct me if I'm wrong, all the 
students pretty well behaved themselves. Didn't

23:52.803 --> 23:54.846
go into town and cause any trouble. No, that's not 
true. It's not true? That's not true. Yeah, there

23:58.131 --> 23:58.932
was... Yeah, there was always the troublemakers 
that went into town. Went up on the hill, they

24:02.716 --> 24:05.560
called it, up on the hill. Oh, that's right. And 
went up on the hill and drank beer and would come

24:06.321 --> 24:18.439
back in and Kutash or Harrington or somebody would 
catch them and it would be trouble. i i will i will

24:19.297 --> 24:36.917
tell this story it's not one that i'm particularly 
proud of but it's a part of history haskell and i

24:19.297 --> 24:36.917
think most of us confess as we get older the things 
that we did in our younger days of indiscretion but

24:19.297 --> 24:36.917
uh these three uh maybe i There were three 
officers, I won't call names, that were older men

24:37.420 --> 24:46.657
and myself and a boy from Columbus, Texas. He was 
also married. We'd travel back and forth from

24:49.122 --> 24:53.309
Junction to Bryan College Station on weekends to 
see our wives. And we were going back out to

24:54.511 --> 24:58.078
Junction the 4th of July weekend. And we stopped at 
Milano, Texas. Now, let's get our words right.

25:03.777 --> 25:07.731
Milano, Texas, which is just up the road here 
outside of Caldwell. I'm sorry, Hearn, between

25:08.234 --> 25:14.420
Hearn and Cut-Off up through Cameron. We stopped 
at Milano and got a barbecued goat. There was a

25:18.924 --> 25:22.888
barbecue going on, and we stopped to get some 
barbecued goat. And the three older guys had iced

25:23.188 --> 25:30.335
down some refreshments. It was hot, no air 
conditioning in the vehicles. It was hot,

25:34.599 --> 25:37.262
unbelievably hot. And we were driving back, 
stopped at Milano. They had some ice-down

25:41.340 --> 25:50.696
refreshments, and we all ate some barbecued, some 
cabrita, and they were drinking a little bit of

25:41.340 --> 25:50.696
refreshment. I was driving, was not. And as a 
matter of fact, I won't say that I never did. I

25:56.166 --> 26:01.415
sampled and tried to find out what that was like in 
my early years at A&M. But I was not drinking. And we

26:03.618 --> 26:10.093
got from Milano to Llano, Texas, just outside 
Junction. And then the 4th of July weekend, these

26:10.113 --> 26:17.290
three officers had some fireworks with them. And 
they threw those fireworks on the courthouse lawn

26:18.417 --> 26:26.328
in Atlanta, Texas, and we got stopped by the city 
marshal or whatever he was. And the report was

26:27.350 --> 26:30.875
forwarded over to Junction. Ed Harrington, Dr. 
Harrington, got the report that there were some

26:31.556 --> 26:39.266
Aggie civil engineering students trying to blow 
up the courthouse over Atlanta. And that was kind

26:39.567 --> 26:44.193
of in jest, too, you know, that they'd been in some 
meanness. When they stopped us, they just said, If

26:47.915 --> 26:54.467
you have another weekend or two that you're going 
from Junction to Bryan College Station, drive

26:47.915 --> 26:54.467
around Llano, okay? Don't come through Llano 
again. And even that, I think, probably was in

26:56.290 --> 26:58.394
jest. But when we got to Junction, Bob Olson met us. 
before we ever got to the adjunct, to the campus

27:05.414 --> 27:12.243
there, and said, Dr. Harrington is terribly 
upset. He has heard that you guys were trying to

27:12.323 --> 27:21.235
blow up the courthouse over at Llano, and I'm just 
telling you that for your own good. And when we got

27:21.355 --> 27:25.380
there, we got a real lecture from Ed Harrington, 
and And no one was really intoxicated, although

27:25.597 --> 27:31.322
those three guys had been drinking. The next 
morning in class at 6.45 or 7 o'clock, whatever

27:31.362 --> 27:46.797
time we went to the classroom every morning, he 
just announced that, I just want you to know there

27:31.362 --> 27:46.797
was some hell raising over in Leno yesterday, and 
we don't tolerate that. Didn't call any names, and

27:46.857 --> 27:49.559
it was over with. In summary, did he handle it the 
way you think he should have? Yes, he was very

27:55.027 --> 28:00.193
professional in handling it, but cut all four of us 
a letter grade. The four of us got D's in that summer

28:00.514 --> 28:06.101
class, and we were the top four students in the 
class. We had the best product, did the best work,

28:06.161 --> 28:10.406
but he cut us a letter grade. And I look back on that 
and say, well, I don't blame him. Sure, why not? I

28:17.294 --> 28:22.080
probably have made that kind of a harsh decision as 
a prof myself. Let's see, other activity, special

28:23.275 --> 28:27.781
things. Mentioned Gyne Hall, MSC. Did you ever 
have any experience with the Quack Shack, the

28:31.206 --> 28:33.970
hospital? Oh, yes, I did, Haskell, and a couple of 
times when I really didn't, I went to the Quack

28:34.130 --> 28:43.303
Shack to avoid harassment. You could always go to 
the Quack Shack and get a, what did they call those?

28:48.284 --> 28:57.558
You got some little, it was a little form that said 
that you, you didn't have to drill for 24 hours,

28:48.284 --> 28:57.558
whatever it was, and you could get rid of the 
nonsense for sure. I went over to Quack Shack and

28:57.618 --> 28:59.241
did that a couple times. I admit that, yes, I did. I 
also went over when I had a blister on my bottom from

29:01.364 --> 29:07.173
brooms. I got whacked a few times with a broom, an 
upperclassman, and it made a blister and kind of

29:08.575 --> 29:15.405
got infected, and I went over and... They wouldn't 
know where it came from, and I told them it had

29:15.385 --> 29:23.097
fallen down, and, you know, and they went, oh, 
that's a blister, blister. It's a blood-type

29:23.417 --> 29:24.579
blister. You don't get that from falling. And I 
never told them where it came from, but they

29:26.281 --> 29:31.629
treated it and gave me a shot, probably a 
penicillin or something. It went about my merry

29:31.669 --> 29:37.779
way, but that probably was the extent of my 
association with the quack shack. But, you know,

29:37.799 --> 29:39.982
it was right there at the end of dorm 14. You walked 
out of dorm 14, and the quack shack was right there

29:40.383 --> 29:44.008
in front of you. Describe the student body in 
general when you were here. Where were they from,

29:49.883 --> 29:58.605
family, attitude,

29:49.883 --> 29:58.605
philosophy, etc.? ? The student body was very, as 
far as geographic distribution, I thought it was

29:59.463 --> 30:05.755
very diverse. We had the Houston kids and 
Dallas-Fort Worth kids. We had a lot of kids from

30:08.740 --> 30:18.418
Atlanta and Jefferson and Marshall and Queen City 
and Shreveport and Wascom and, you know, and

30:08.740 --> 30:18.418
McAllen. And we had folks from all around. I 
thought it was rather diverse geographically. We

30:23.307 --> 30:29.615
obviously were essentially all white, all male. 
But were there some Hispanics? Oh, yes, there

30:33.019 --> 30:39.426
were, I won't say a large number, but a very 
significant number of Hispanics. German, Czech?

30:42.310 --> 30:50.480
Oh, yeah, Bobby Zawczyk and these guys, yeah, 
there were all sorts of, yeah, from ethnic

30:42.310 --> 30:50.480
background, yeah, German, Czech. Did it matter? 
No, no. I mean, we were all there together. I have

30:54.798 --> 31:12.285
very fond memories of Ramundo Riojas, one of my 
classmates from Mexico,

30:54.798 --> 31:12.285
George Gutierrez, a lot of Hispanic civil 
engineering students that I went to school with.

31:13.507 --> 31:14.148
No, it didn't matter. I mean, we were just a group. 
And Catholics and Protestants?
