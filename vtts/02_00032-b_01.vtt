WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:08.388
I got up every day and went.

00:08.488 --> 00:13.192
Now, Herbert would stay in bed some, but I didn't.

00:13.633 --> 00:18.757
I always had breakfast on Sunday morning and came back.

00:20.078 --> 00:32.029
And generally, Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon to me were study periods

00:33.038 --> 00:43.390
because I was anxious to do well in my studies, and I did reasonably well.

00:45.253 --> 00:59.890
And I was able to—I really wanted to get a combined ME petroleum degree, and I could have petitioned for it.

01:00.764 --> 01:07.730
because I took a three-hour power course instead of a five-hour power course or something like that.

01:08.912 --> 01:21.804
But the war came on on a Sunday in my junior year, and from that point on, I wanted to get through with school and get in the melee.

01:22.905 --> 01:25.387
All right, let's jump to that.

01:25.747 --> 01:28.830
You're a junior, beginning your junior year,

01:29.992 --> 01:34.679
Uh, where were you when you heard the news about December 7, 1941?

01:35.020 --> 01:36.562
I was in my room studying.

01:37.664 --> 01:40.067
And they had the free show in Guyon Hall.

01:41.329 --> 01:44.774
And the guys, when they came out of the free show, they hollered up at me.

01:44.874 --> 01:53.267
I was in, we were in B ramp, uh, in, uh, the dormitory.

01:54.649 --> 01:58.615
And they came out of school and on the military walk, hollered up at me.

01:59.810 --> 02:07.138
And then they came up in the room and we all sat around and said, well, we'll never finish this semester.

02:08.199 --> 02:24.376
They'll take us in and there was a lot of ifs and we're on the radio back and forth listening and talking and pretty much that evening, it went through that.

02:25.477 --> 02:28.500
And then we had, next morning was

02:28.919 --> 02:35.553
Monday and we went through our normal routine.

02:35.593 --> 02:41.845
Did you listen to President Roosevelt's speech to the Congress on that Monday?

02:42.346 --> 02:43.409
I don't believe so.

02:43.469 --> 02:49.020
I believe we were in class and I didn't miss a class.

02:49.068 --> 02:52.495
Did the Commandant call the Corps together or anybody?

02:52.515 --> 02:54.398
I don't remember that, no.

02:55.741 --> 03:08.005
We just pretty well went on but knew that our seniors were going to be gone at the end of that year and the end of the second semester.

03:09.368 --> 03:14.815
and thought we probably might, but we didn't.

03:14.855 --> 03:21.703
They kept us there and we took our fall semester that summer, our spring semester in the fall and got out.

03:21.844 --> 03:23.265
So you started the trimester.

03:23.526 --> 03:25.388
Yeah.

03:25.408 --> 03:31.335
After your sophomore year, did you go to summer camp, ROTC camp, after your sophomore year?

03:33.078 --> 03:33.418
No.

03:33.736 --> 03:36.638
So you hadn't been to ROTC camp?

03:36.659 --> 03:36.919
No.

03:37.239 --> 03:38.620
When Pearl Harbor came.

03:40.782 --> 03:44.425
Do you remember it changing the routine in classes?

03:44.745 --> 03:48.629
Did people become more serious about their studies?

03:48.989 --> 03:49.670
Very much.

03:50.651 --> 03:55.875
Very much more serious and very much more serious about military.

03:58.237 --> 04:02.781
You recognize that

04:04.448 --> 04:12.938
Some of the bull ticks that we called it was significant and we'd better learn it and learn it well.

04:14.159 --> 04:22.008
And we were in a fortuitous position where when we finished our contract, we were getting paid then.

04:23.850 --> 04:33.561
And when we finished it, we were going to be counted on to be officers and we had to be Aggie officers and they had to be good officers.

04:34.199 --> 04:36.724
Why did you all think that Aggie officers were special?

04:37.826 --> 04:38.808
Because they were.

04:38.848 --> 04:44.218
They were good people.

04:44.258 --> 04:48.986
The guys that were no good, they left A&M and went someplace else.

04:50.970 --> 04:52.854
Who was the commandant then?

04:53.375 --> 04:55.819
Do you remember?

05:00.490 --> 05:01.331
Was Colonel Andy?

05:01.451 --> 05:02.292
He wasn't, was he?

05:02.673 --> 05:05.356
No, name another one.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.278
I don't know that era.

05:11.363 --> 05:14.847
Guys, I ought to know him, but I don't recall his name.

05:15.027 --> 05:16.609
If you'd say it, I might remember.

05:17.050 --> 05:17.871
Was it Walton?

05:18.772 --> 05:20.133
I think he was just the president.

05:20.173 --> 05:21.855
I don't believe he was the commandant.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.417
Oh, oh, commandant.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.139
Oh, I was thinking about president.

05:25.159 --> 05:25.980
Oh, commandant.

05:27.242 --> 05:28.303
Who was running the Corps?

05:33.447 --> 05:39.155
Oh, I should know that.

05:40.196 --> 05:41.037
He was a colonel.

05:44.341 --> 05:49.108
I can't call his name, but he was a white-headed colonel.

05:50.489 --> 05:56.197
When the war started, did the pranks and all begin to slow down?

05:56.437 --> 05:56.738
Yes.

05:57.038 --> 05:58.019
There was less mischief?

05:58.480 --> 06:01.564
Less mischief and more...

06:03.029 --> 06:09.527
Boy, we're in it and we're in it up to here and better apply yourself.

06:09.728 --> 06:13.759
What did you and your parents, what communication did you all have?

06:14.682 --> 06:18.051
What did you say to each other when the war started?

06:19.718 --> 06:31.068
Well, mother and dad asked were they going to pull us out of school right then and I said there's no way, I have no knowledge of that.

06:31.729 --> 06:33.511
Nothing has been said about that.

06:34.932 --> 06:48.004
And they were just more concerned that you get your, they were concerned that you get a college education.

06:49.672 --> 06:52.896
So you come home Christmas.

06:54.879 --> 06:58.784
Did some of your buddies drop out of school and go volunteer?

07:03.770 --> 07:07.895
Some did, but I wouldn't say any of my buddies or people that I knew.

07:08.516 --> 07:10.318
You'd hear stories about them.

07:10.338 --> 07:11.880
But most Aggies stayed in school?

07:11.900 --> 07:12.301
Yes.

07:14.023 --> 07:17.788
When did they announce, as far as you remember, the trimester program?

07:18.950 --> 07:20.652
Spring of 42?

07:21.733 --> 07:39.875
Yeah, in the spring of 42 and I knew when that spring semester was over that you had about a week off and I went down to Galveston with a bunch of the Houston people and we stayed down there about three days.

07:40.716 --> 07:48.805
We came back to school to get ready because we were serious and we wanted to get a

07:50.168 --> 07:58.236
What would a group of, a small group of Aggies do in Galveston?

07:58.276 --> 07:59.137
What did y'all have?

07:59.297 --> 08:00.699
What kind of weekend did y'all have?

08:02.521 --> 08:15.334
We went crab fishing and had a big pot and boiled those crabs in the pot and swam in the surf.

08:16.936 --> 08:18.117
Did you do any partying?

08:18.434 --> 08:19.896
Very little.

08:20.857 --> 08:40.122
We were, the only summer I was down there was, the war was four or five months old and we were pretty well concerned with that and thought hopefully that we would get to finish our college education.

08:41.468 --> 08:49.640
But we were starting our spring, what really was our fall semester that summer and going to be our spring semester in the fall.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.462
We got out just before Christmas.

08:54.166 --> 09:04.381
Back before the war started, where did Aggies, what kind, what did Aggies do to have a good time in College Station and Bryan?

09:04.401 --> 09:06.624
Where did Aggies go to have a good time?

09:07.265 --> 09:11.070
Oh gosh, I can't call

09:13.143 --> 09:13.904
Was Uncle Ed?

09:14.105 --> 09:15.387
A&M's here, yeah.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.974
I'm talking about the railroad track was down there.

09:19.014 --> 09:20.737
What was this area down here?

09:21.058 --> 09:21.699
Uncle Ed's?

09:21.759 --> 09:22.841
Yeah, Uncle Ed's.

09:23.342 --> 09:24.765
Describe Uncle Ed's.

09:24.785 --> 09:28.752
Well, Uncle Ed's was a beer joint to me.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.175
That's what it was.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.940
And it was...

09:35.047 --> 09:39.792
It was, I'd say, four times the size of this office.

09:41.233 --> 09:45.878
And had booths and people went down there.

09:45.978 --> 09:47.579
Did people behave themselves?

09:48.180 --> 09:48.780
Pretty well.

09:50.102 --> 09:52.644
Is it a place where you would have taken your mother and dad?

09:52.664 --> 09:57.329
No, I wouldn't have taken them there.

09:58.150 --> 10:04.716
And did Uncle Ed worry about the legal minimum age of a beer drinker?

10:05.135 --> 10:06.276
I don't think he did.

10:06.316 --> 10:11.542
Now, and whiskey was not legal in Brazos County then, was it?

10:11.582 --> 10:12.183
No, it wasn't.

10:12.203 --> 10:13.524
You had to go across the river.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.667
Did y'all call it Whiskey Bridge?

10:17.329 --> 10:18.370
I don't recall that.

10:18.390 --> 10:18.891
All right.

10:18.971 --> 10:20.532
Later, that's what they would nickname it.

10:20.552 --> 10:23.015
You went across Whiskey Bridge to... Oh, you did.

10:23.075 --> 10:23.976
What do we call it?

10:24.016 --> 10:30.444
Going across the river and get... I've never heard anybody mention a bootlegger.

10:30.524 --> 10:33.047
Did you ever hear of a bootlegger in Brazos County?

10:33.287 --> 10:34.348
No, I didn't.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.643
And I've never heard of a house of ill repute in Brazos County.

10:38.924 --> 10:40.005
Did you ever hear of any?

10:40.966 --> 10:42.647
I didn't know of any if there was.

10:43.028 --> 10:45.390
And did the chicken ranch exist in those days?

10:45.410 --> 10:45.750
Yeah.

10:45.770 --> 10:46.131
It did?

10:46.211 --> 10:47.272
Chicken ranch did.

10:47.993 --> 10:51.256
Did you ever hear of Aggies talking about going to the chicken ranch?

10:51.716 --> 10:53.798
Yeah.

10:53.918 --> 11:02.547
I don't believe I ever did because I always had girls that from Dallas that

11:04.012 --> 11:24.822
I had known, and matter of fact, probably for the last three years, was, this was my, the girl that I eventually married, and she was going to school, did I name it?

11:25.063 --> 11:25.483
Stevens.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.087
Stevens, up in Missouri.

11:28.207 --> 11:30.070
Yeah, sure.

11:32.007 --> 11:35.451
I was, I used to go to the dances and.

11:37.514 --> 11:39.116
Did she ever come down there to visit?

11:39.637 --> 11:40.017
Yes.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.100
Where did she stay when she was?

11:43.342 --> 11:46.926
Stayed with one of the professors in one of the professors houses.

11:47.046 --> 11:47.887
There on campus?

11:48.028 --> 11:49.950
Yes.

11:49.970 --> 11:56.158
How did you, how did you Aggies treat those girls when they came to a campus dance?

11:57.387 --> 12:03.275
Well, it depends on what it was.

12:03.415 --> 12:16.392
What I'd do is, when Jerry was up at school in Missouri, I'd go to the dances about 9 o'clock.

12:17.975 --> 12:22.000
And I'd just stand there and watch.

12:22.461 --> 12:26.126
And when somebody caught my eye, I'd wink at them.

12:27.307 --> 12:30.732
And if they winked back, then I'd go tag them.

12:30.752 --> 12:33.195
And who you got a date with?

12:33.575 --> 12:37.080
They'd say, oh, God, he's a nerd, isn't he?

12:37.060 --> 12:41.907
And you want to get you ahead of him and have a late date where you're staying.

12:42.808 --> 12:48.997
And they had to be staying there on campus for me to go because I didn't have a car to get to Brian if they were staying there.

12:50.419 --> 12:51.220
I'd chuck them.

12:52.842 --> 12:54.985
Where would you all then go on a late date?

12:55.572 --> 12:57.415
down to the petroleum building.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.939
Pasco Martin was one of my professors.

13:01.161 --> 13:10.975
And Pasco gave me a passkey and we'd go in and go down to the women's restroom and in there they had a sofa and two easy chairs.

13:12.478 --> 13:15.542
And I'd take them there because I was afoot.

13:18.447 --> 13:20.550
But that was a good place to take them.

13:21.307 --> 13:25.912
And now, and when the girls came to a dance, they wore big formal dresses.

13:26.993 --> 13:27.493
Is that right?

13:27.673 --> 13:28.654
Yeah.

13:29.615 --> 13:34.600
And during that era, did bus or train loads of Tessies come down?

13:35.621 --> 13:37.583
I didn't know about it if they did.

13:39.405 --> 13:49.795
I didn't ever, I'll, when I went to the dances, and this is my junior and senior year,

13:50.804 --> 13:54.607
Uh, I usually had been studying all Saturday afternoon.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.827
We'd go to the dance and, uh,

13:59.478 --> 14:01.441
try to get in without paying the dollar.

14:03.965 --> 14:17.467
But then I'd stand there and watch, and you'd see girls, and if one of them would catch your eye, you'd wink at them, and if they wink back, there's one I'll try, and another I'll try, and another I'll try.

14:17.507 --> 14:19.590
Tell him you feel sick.

14:20.191 --> 14:25.620
Tell him you want to go back and try to get a late date.

14:26.005 --> 14:31.071
Do you remember any big bands of the famous bands that came to play at A&M?

14:31.211 --> 14:31.852
Oh, yeah.

14:32.353 --> 14:33.394
We had a bunch of them.

14:33.975 --> 14:45.349
I'm not good on band names, but... Dorsey's, Kay Kaiser, Guy Lombardo... Those, and, uh... Glenn Miller?

14:46.250 --> 14:51.456
Yeah, and then what's the one now that's, uh...

14:53.039 --> 14:55.282
He's still on every Sunday night.

14:58.386 --> 14:58.526
Oh.

14:58.926 --> 15:03.592
Oh, boy.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.955
From one of the Dakotas.

15:06.576 --> 15:06.916
Yeah.

15:07.016 --> 15:07.577
Yeah.

15:07.597 --> 15:08.558
Yeah.

15:08.698 --> 15:09.579
That guy.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.583
He always made a trip to A&M every year.

15:14.125 --> 15:18.490
And how did, while the dance is underway, how did the Aggies behave?

15:20.512 --> 15:21.313
At Cebisa?

15:22.254 --> 15:23.615
They behaved like gentlemen.

15:25.097 --> 15:25.938
They really did.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.621
Did Aggie smoke much then?

15:30.743 --> 15:31.063
Yeah.

15:32.084 --> 15:33.906
And what were they smoking?

15:34.206 --> 15:37.850
Camels, Lucky Strikes, Chesterfields.

15:39.332 --> 15:42.455
And was it okay to go outside Cebisa and smoke?

15:42.635 --> 15:44.477
Yeah, on the steps.

15:44.697 --> 15:46.519
Did anybody smoke cigars?

15:47.495 --> 15:48.777
I don't remember that.

15:49.277 --> 15:55.646
A few people smoked pipes in studying, but I don't recall anybody with cigars.

15:56.066 --> 15:58.329
Did Aggies chew tobacco or dip snuff?

15:59.271 --> 16:00.512
Yeah.

16:00.692 --> 16:04.658
I don't know about dipping snuff, but you had some of them that chewed tobacco.

16:06.801 --> 16:07.702
I remember that.

16:08.683 --> 16:11.827
I'd tell them, spit in the grass.

16:11.987 --> 16:14.751
I'd spit on the sidewalk.

16:15.473 --> 16:20.218
Did you guys even know that marijuana or heroin existed?

16:21.099 --> 16:28.746
We knew it existed, but I never knew anybody that had it or never knew anybody that used it or tried to use it.

16:28.806 --> 16:31.069
And never heard of any of the drugs of today?

16:31.249 --> 16:31.509
No.

16:33.291 --> 16:34.392
I didn't.

16:34.632 --> 16:36.955
I don't think that anybody did.

16:39.657 --> 16:45.143
When you all went downtown Bryan, where were the great places, what did anybody go to Bryan for?

16:45.494 --> 16:51.184
I don't believe I went to Bryan twice in my whole career at A&M.

16:52.407 --> 16:56.414
What was there at Northgate?

16:57.516 --> 17:09.257
Well, the post office was at Northgate, and across from the post office was this way, but then the street here, there was a drug store there.

17:09.592 --> 17:11.677
I think Hollicks had a place there.

17:12.098 --> 17:12.539
Lupo?

17:13.021 --> 17:14.845
Lupo had a place there.

17:14.906 --> 17:17.893
Did you ever borrow money from Lupo?

17:18.094 --> 17:18.354
No.

17:19.978 --> 17:20.520
Never did.

17:20.941 --> 17:24.951
About how much spending money did you have?

17:28.171 --> 17:34.100
I'd probably have a dollar a week, maybe 75 cents a week.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.825
And you'd, what did you spend that on?

17:36.845 --> 17:47.942
Uh, cigarettes, uh, generally that's pretty much what I spent it on.

17:49.184 --> 17:51.207
And uh, uh.

17:51.227 --> 17:54.432
You'd buy cigarettes then were 16 cents a pack.

17:54.833 --> 18:02.448
If you needed to make an emergency long-distance phone call, where was the phone for a boy in Hart Hall?

18:03.390 --> 18:04.772
At the bottom of B ramp.

18:05.955 --> 18:11.044
Do you remember any phone call, any long-distance calls you made?

18:11.085 --> 18:14.952
Oh, I may have...

18:16.990 --> 18:22.938
call my parents once on when we went to school all the time.

18:24.300 --> 18:30.789
Mother's birthday was in July and dad was in August and if I was there I'd probably call them.

18:30.829 --> 18:39.100
When you worked in the summer did you save that money for your spending money or did you use part of that to pay

18:39.738 --> 18:40.939
your fees at A&M?

18:42.381 --> 18:44.183
I used that for my spending money.

18:44.463 --> 18:51.951
And the family paid my fees at A&M and never asked me to participate in that.

18:53.112 --> 18:56.175
But my mother's birthday is July 28th.

18:56.395 --> 18:58.538
That was August the 26th.

18:59.919 --> 19:03.703
And I spent my summer money that I made in the summers

19:04.983 --> 19:09.168
trying to buy big presents for mother and then a big present for dad.

19:13.592 --> 19:21.201
What kind of encouragement did they give you while you were a student to keep on trying, keep on working hard?

19:25.385 --> 19:30.311
Well, I don't know who Winsaki was, but buckle down, Winsaki, buckle down.

19:31.412 --> 19:34.095
You can win Winsaki if you buckle down.

19:34.835 --> 19:43.187
And that was, uh, something that dad taught me.

19:43.768 --> 19:49.156
And, uh, he said, uh, you want to make your mama proud of you, bum.

19:50.558 --> 20:01.534
And that's, you don't goof off and, uh, it's costing money to keep you down here and make your mama proud of you.

20:02.054 --> 20:08.921
Do you remember any problems that came up while you were there and you went to somebody for advice and how do I deal with this?

20:12.225 --> 20:27.842
I don't really recall anything that if I did I probably would have gone to oh gosh

20:30.826 --> 20:36.033
Jack Hayes, one of the petroleum PE profs.

20:38.095 --> 20:41.119
What was another guy?

20:41.620 --> 20:57.660
Watson Watkins, start with a W. I don't remember, but Pascal Martin, you remember who Pascal was?

20:58.838 --> 21:01.542
He was in the training department.

21:01.562 --> 21:10.276
Mr. Vance, Jack Hayes, I've said that.

21:12.800 --> 21:17.047
They were people that I felt comfortable talking to about.

21:18.449 --> 21:24.238
As you look back on those courses you had,

21:24.708 --> 21:33.826
the preparation you had in engineering, particularly in petroleum, how would you evaluate the quality of the instruction you got at A&M?

21:34.247 --> 21:35.309
I think it was very good.

21:37.394 --> 21:39.578
Mr. Vance did an interesting thing.

21:41.313 --> 21:59.176
Uh, probably the last half of my junior year, and I was doing good, and, uh, I was top kick of the outfit, and, uh, Mr. Vance said, uh, I want to see you after class.

22:00.999 --> 22:06.586
And so, I went in there, and he said, did you ever know him?

22:08.068 --> 22:11.252
Well, he's big tall, uh,

22:12.818 --> 22:15.841
Will you go get this book for me?

22:16.102 --> 22:22.128
And he gave me a slip of paper with the book on it, and the book's name.

22:23.930 --> 22:29.896
And so I go to the library, and the book isn't there.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.519
But it's checked out to somebody.

22:34.501 --> 22:40.007
I've forgotten who it was checked out to, but I knew the person that it was checked out to.

22:41.860 --> 22:46.287
And so he was—I found out where he was.

22:46.347 --> 22:48.570
He had a class in the academic building.

22:49.992 --> 22:51.715
And I went over to the academic building.

22:51.795 --> 22:57.944
I was cutting the class to do this because I wanted to make an impression on Mr. Vance.

22:58.825 --> 23:04.714
And I found out where he was, and he was either the last or the next-to-last classroom.

23:05.475 --> 23:09.201
There was two classrooms and then the office of his professor.

23:11.257 --> 23:24.092
I went in, interrupted the class, told his professor I had an urgent message for him from Mr. Vance, head of the Petroleum Department.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.654
Could I speak to him a minute?

23:26.595 --> 23:29.639
Took him outside, told him I wanted the book.

23:30.520 --> 23:35.706
And he said, well, I've got it with me.

23:36.907 --> 23:40.251
And I said, well, give it to me and let me have it.

23:41.395 --> 23:46.020
And I'll take it to Mr. Vance, and then I'll tell Mr. Vance to give it back to you.

23:47.302 --> 23:57.894
So he did, and I took it to Mr. Vance, and Mr. Vance said, uh, that's fine.

23:57.974 --> 23:59.356
Did you learn anything?

24:01.858 --> 24:07.064
And I said, uh, well, I learned where the book was.

24:07.184 --> 24:11.149
If you're asking me that, Mr. Vance, I learned it was checked out of the library.

24:11.737 --> 24:13.159
I found out who had it.

24:14.321 --> 24:16.844
I found out where he was, and I went and got it.

24:17.285 --> 24:18.086
I learned that.

24:19.868 --> 24:27.859
And he said, well, you didn't turn around and come back and tell me that it was checked out, and you couldn't do the job I sent you to do?

24:29.321 --> 24:30.222
And I said, no, sir.

24:30.483 --> 24:32.505
I decided I'd better find that book.

24:34.488 --> 24:38.173
Don't ever forget it as long as you live.

24:38.754 --> 24:40.917
Find that book.

24:43.124 --> 24:46.791
And that was an impressive lesson to me.

24:46.831 --> 24:55.729
And I now think the old man must have set the procedure up to see what I'd do.

24:55.809 --> 24:59.477
But I didn't come back and tell him I can't get it.

25:00.479 --> 25:01.000
You got it.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.124
I got it.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.269
He had a long bony finger.

25:06.070 --> 25:11.658
That's a good lesson and don't ever forget it as long as you live.

25:12.520 --> 25:28.943
And I cannot tell you how many times in my life I have been frustrated at not getting something accomplished and thinking of that and think that Mr. Vance probably set that whole thing up

25:29.783 --> 25:32.768
to see how I'd react to it and what I'd do.

25:34.310 --> 25:38.557
And, brother, don't come back and say I can't.

25:38.897 --> 25:40.079
You find a way.

25:40.720 --> 25:45.928
Now, that's exactly the kinds of things that we're delighted to have in these, those personal experiences.

25:46.809 --> 25:57.546
As you recall those courses, was the emphasis on the theoretical side of engineering or the practical applied?

25:57.965 --> 25:59.648
More of the practical applied.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.433
That's what I got out of it.

26:02.894 --> 26:08.223
And had these people, many of these men, actually been involved in petroleum?

26:09.085 --> 26:10.147
Had they actually done?

26:10.828 --> 26:12.030
Well, Mr. Vance had.

26:12.050 --> 26:16.298
And I think Pascal Martin had.

26:16.318 --> 26:19.804
Those were the only two I knew that

26:20.324 --> 26:27.071
Were there any courses outside engineering that you also remember as important that helped you?

26:29.693 --> 26:30.454
Or any teachers?

26:30.474 --> 26:49.673
I took an English class, and it was in public speaking, and there was 20 of us in there, and they seated us alphabetically, and the Bs, I was the first one.

26:51.020 --> 26:55.225
And I cannot recall his name.

26:56.386 --> 27:00.550
He was a small—he was a short man, a little heavy set.

27:01.772 --> 27:10.301
But he was in the back of the room, and he called my name and said, I want you to make a ten-minute speech.

27:12.363 --> 27:15.046
And I said, well, what do you want me to speak about?

27:15.086 --> 27:18.850
He said, you're making the speech.

27:20.112 --> 27:25.325
And so I talked about the evils of alcohol and loose women to the incoming college student.

27:28.273 --> 27:35.792
You know, I just had to think of something walking up when he told me that.

27:36.498 --> 27:59.333
And I just thought this, because that was my junior year and we met with the incoming freshmen and the, both the first sergeant and the CO spoke to them about that and it was,

28:01.726 --> 28:05.011
It was a good thing to teach the kid.

28:05.792 --> 28:21.977
The first time he's out from under parental supervision and he is his own master and he needs to not succumb to the evils of alcohol and loose women to the detriment.

28:22.417 --> 28:26.063
Was that teacher perhaps Professor Kofer?

28:27.173 --> 28:28.615
David Brooks Cofer?

28:28.975 --> 28:32.159
Oh, I had Cofer, and that may have been who it was.

28:32.300 --> 28:32.780
I forgot.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.502
Did he teach public speaking?

28:34.522 --> 28:34.963
I don't know.

28:35.404 --> 28:35.784
I don't know.

28:36.145 --> 28:37.086
I can't recall.

28:37.807 --> 28:40.330
Describe going to the library in your days.

28:40.390 --> 28:41.511
What was the library like?

28:44.175 --> 28:51.204
Well, the library was run by women, some of whom were very attractive.

28:51.685 --> 28:53.607
Was Tommy Mayo, though, the librarian?

28:54.228 --> 28:55.189
I don't remember.

28:57.633 --> 28:59.116
Did you go over there to study much?

28:59.597 --> 28:59.898
No.

29:01.742 --> 29:03.024
We were in Hart Hall.

29:03.064 --> 29:06.812
And I pretty well did my studying in Hart Hall.

29:07.433 --> 29:13.967
And I got to live, I don't know if you remember B-Ramp, the corner rooms.

29:13.987 --> 29:15.490
I was the only sophomore.

29:16.364 --> 29:18.947
They picked me and they sent me there.

29:20.409 --> 29:25.074
In my sophomore year, I was in the corner room and B ramp.

29:25.915 --> 29:29.239
My junior year, I was first sergeant and I was in the corner room.

29:29.980 --> 29:33.124
My senior year, I was CO and I was in the corner room.

29:33.384 --> 29:35.927
I had one of those big corner rooms.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.936
When you became a junior or senior, what did you expect the fish to do in your room?

29:45.478 --> 29:46.219
Clean it up.

29:47.802 --> 30:04.431
Then clean it up and see that the books, that time we had my bookcase, see that it was straightened up and get the habit clean.

30:05.192 --> 30:12.966
Now I was probably in class an average of six and a half hours a day.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.523
both my junior and senior years.

30:18.045 --> 30:42.835
I was taking extra courses, and I was going to petition for the combined degree, and then because I had taken only a three-hour power course when you were supposed to take a five-hour course, and I had another three hours where I'd have to get a petition, but it was time for me to go to war, and I didn't bother doing that, and

30:42.967 --> 30:45.290
But for that two hours?

30:46.271 --> 30:47.672
Two courses, two hours.

30:49.294 --> 30:51.737
But it was the ME degree that I was missing.

30:51.817 --> 30:52.798
I had the petroleum.

30:54.119 --> 31:01.387
When you were a junior or senior, did the freshman ever try to play any pranks on you in your outfit?

31:01.728 --> 31:03.570
Not when I was a junior or senior.

31:03.870 --> 31:05.372
They did as a sophomore.

31:05.812 --> 31:09.396
Were any of them creative?

31:10.304 --> 31:14.796
Mostly buckets of water or...
