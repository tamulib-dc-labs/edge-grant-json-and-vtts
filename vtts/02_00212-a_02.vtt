WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:08.289
When

00:03.524 --> 00:08.289
it comes to raising your children. That's not 
being a dud. Did y'all make some close friends in

00:10.251 --> 00:13.013
Austin? We got along real well with his employees. 
And

00:18.319 --> 00:26.767
we, Dr.

00:18.319 --> 00:26.767
Ashworth.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.873
He was there, of course, one of Jack's. But in two 
years, you don't get that involved in a big city

00:33.224 --> 00:39.652
with your husband traveling all over the state.

00:43.437 --> 00:46.680
But life wasn't dull. We were involved in things, 
but we never were really, as far as the city was

00:47.742 --> 00:56.352
concerned, that involved in anything. I went to 
the church. I belonged to a woman's group, but I

00:57.794 --> 01:02.640
wasn't working at it. And if you don't work at 
something, you're not part of it. Now, were those

01:05.870 --> 01:14.179
Texans receptive to Carolinians, Virginians 
moving there? Were you all treated courteously in

01:14.239 --> 01:17.222
Austin? Sure. I don't think that... That was a 
cosmopolitan city. I don't think there's any

01:21.326 --> 01:22.968
problem there. Right. And then you went to 
Tennessee, and you all lived in Knoxville?

01:29.114 --> 01:29.354
Mm-hmm. Describe Andy Holt.

01:34.801 --> 01:35.642
His character. Everybody loved him. He had a 
charming way of being around people. And do you

01:44.114 --> 01:48.080
know that after we moved, that he would take Mary 
fishing? When his wife went to her club, he would

01:48.540 --> 01:51.625
take Mary out to fish. Then he would go and dress the 
fish for her. After we left, he was...

02:03.691 --> 02:11.260
He just was a lovable personality as far as I'm 
concerned and successful in what he did. As head of

02:11.280 --> 02:28.061
the University of Tennessee system, I have often 
thought that in many ways Jack Kenny Williams and

02:11.280 --> 02:28.061
the way he went about things was similar to Andy 
Holt in the way he went about things. Would you

02:28.561 --> 02:29.503
agree with that? They both had good senses of 
humor?

02:35.737 --> 02:37.939
Well, they weren't the type to push their weight 
around. They both had a way of... Jack had a way of

02:37.979 --> 02:43.805
getting things done without being abrasive, 
don't you think? Yes, didn't Dr. Holt? Well, of

02:45.847 --> 02:56.498
course, I wasn't that close to Dr. Holt in two 
years, you know, to know, but he was liked and loved

02:45.847 --> 02:56.498
as far as I'm concerned, and I didn't know his 
enemies. Everybody has them. Everybody makes

02:58.701 --> 02:59.982
them. But both Williams and Holt When I saw them 
publicly, they had a good sense of humor when it was

03:03.530 --> 03:13.784
time to be humorous and a very good sense of 
seriousness when it was time to be serious. And

03:13.804 --> 03:15.866
neither one of them would talk about the 
unpleasant. Jack didn't talk about the

03:17.208 --> 03:21.394
unpleasant things. You never heard him talk about 
the people on the board that were not cooperative

03:21.654 --> 03:28.343
with anything he wanted. You never heard him talk 
about it, did you? No, no.

03:35.525 --> 03:51.128
I think that there are ways to get things done, and I 
don't know how Jack did it, but he got things done

03:35.525 --> 03:51.128
because he would just sort of say this is what we 
need to do and work at it and get someone to help. He

03:51.168 --> 03:53.471
used people. You felt used, didn't you? Like you 
did about putting together the... No, I always

03:56.035 --> 04:03.726
thought the assignments were very appropriate. 
But you were never ignored. Oh, no. Very true. That

04:07.843 --> 04:10.586
you were part of the team. That's right. He worked 
with you. I shouldn't say used you, but he worked

04:13.029 --> 04:16.494
with the team. Very much so. When you all came to 
A&M, when did you first see the House, the

04:19.638 --> 04:28.549
President's House? Did you all come to visit 
before he accepted? I was there with the Rutters

04:31.638 --> 04:35.444
when he was commissioner of higher education. So 
you had been... Margaret had, while Jack was there

04:35.464 --> 04:44.015
for a meeting, she asked Governor Conley to come by 
and meet me, and he did. He came by the house and met

04:44.075 --> 04:46.479
me and the two girls. Just briefly. Let's digress 
on... But I didn't go up and look in the clauses or

04:50.284 --> 04:53.288
anything like that. Describe your impression of 
John Conley. describe what kind of governor did he

04:59.444 --> 05:03.669
seem to be? I thought he was a successful governor 
and a leader that he got. He and Margaret Rutter

05:10.256 --> 05:12.138
were in school together. They were good friends. I 
don't think that I was in the position to evaluate

05:14.901 --> 05:22.970
him as the governor of Texas pro or con. I wasn't 
that involved with it.

05:29.532 --> 05:32.635
I think you overrate me for thinking that I would 
know. But he was an influence in bringing Jack back

05:33.456 --> 05:52.795
to Texas A&M when a member of the board, and I don't 
remember which one of them I heard to say this, that

05:33.456 --> 05:52.795
they went to John Connolly to check on Jack because 
he'd been commissioner, and he said, get him if you

05:33.456 --> 05:52.795
can. Now, that's an important fact for us to 
record. I learned, by the way, not long ago from

05:58.186 --> 06:06.073
Mrs. Rutter, when I referred to Nellie Connolly, 
that that really wasn't her name. And I said, oh,

06:06.774 --> 06:13.480
and she said her name was Milda, I believe Milda 
May, all one word. But that when... Ida Nell. Ida

06:17.444 --> 06:17.905
Nell. Ida Nell, there's a song. But that then when 
he was running for governor, one of the campaign

06:19.666 --> 06:26.893
managers said that that sounded not as as upbeat as 
Nellie. So that she said, all of us knew her as Ida

06:29.546 --> 06:36.857
Nell, but the reporters called her Nellie. When 
you all arrived at the campus, was there any

06:37.838 --> 06:48.113
furniture in the house? Yes. And how did your 
furniture fit into them? Well, I gave most of my

06:52.379 --> 06:55.564
furniture to Margaret Rudder. for a period of 
time. I took my furniture and furnished Mary's

06:58.185 --> 07:07.317
bedroom and her sitting room upstairs. So she had 
family furniture in those two rooms. And the rest

07:11.883 --> 07:15.948
of it either went in the store or to the Rutter's 
house. Margaret had not bought furniture. See,

07:19.433 --> 07:21.776
she'd been living in a furnished house. And I 
hadn't. I had my own secondhand stuff. But

07:26.678 --> 07:36.940
I felt like Mary deserved to have only family 
furniture in her two rooms, which is what I did. And

07:36.980 --> 07:45.598
the rest of it now, I had in one bedroom, I had an 
antique bed that my granddaddy cut down the tree

07:36.980 --> 07:45.598
and had made for his wedding bed, and my 
granddaughter has it now. I put that in one room,

07:49.999 --> 07:57.688
and I put another bed that I'm sleeping in right now 
in another bedroom upstairs. I guess those

07:59.230 --> 08:03.996
bedrooms weren't furnished, or weren't totally 
furnished. There may have been something in their

08:04.016 --> 08:05.598
rooms. But I remember I had two of my beds upstairs, 
and they had a king-size bed. in the master

08:16.274 --> 08:18.037
bedroom.

08:22.023 --> 08:32.200
And I can't remember where I made that, finally 
made that into two twin beds or what I did, but

08:22.023 --> 08:32.200
anyway it was, I just sort of adjusted what we 
needed and what we had. And then later on I sent from

08:32.240 --> 08:43.378
Margaret, I got back the sofa that's in the living 
room to put in Jack's office because they had a

08:32.240 --> 08:43.378
little plastic type sofa in there that wasn't very 
nice. And turn it off, and I'll tell you an

08:44.573 --> 08:47.217
interesting story. When you got to the campus, 
what kind of staffing was there for the

08:47.778 --> 08:56.711
president's home? Was there a full-time 
employee? Well, yeah. This I can't put in. I had

09:05.024 --> 09:12.555
Willie, a black man that had been the chauffeur for 
the Rutter children and the bartender. And

09:14.172 --> 09:18.358
Juanita had left with Margaret, that was the cook. 
And they brought a lady over that couldn't even set

09:20.441 --> 09:24.267
up a tea tray. And she was a minister's daughter, I 
mean a wife. Is this on? You want me to turn it on? Who

09:32.680 --> 09:39.310
were, in your College Station years, who were the 
favorite friends of the Williams? Who did you all

09:39.330 --> 09:41.513
enjoy most as friends?

09:53.947 --> 09:59.235
We never invited people into the house at night 
unless there was some special occasion. When Jack

09:59.275 --> 10:09.670
came home, what times he was home at night, I never 
added to his evenings unless it was something

09:59.275 --> 10:09.670
unusual.

10:13.615 --> 10:18.883
We never had, like the Rudders did, a group of 
people that came to the house to party. We never had

10:19.323 --> 10:21.827
that.

10:24.271 --> 10:32.486
I probably wonder now if the people on his staff 
didn't wonder why aren't we ever invited to dinner

10:24.271 --> 10:32.486
at their house. You weren't.

10:37.615 --> 10:39.779
Because the schedule was so demanding, I know. I 
never added. We never had. He once asked me to let

10:42.563 --> 10:56.538
him invite the children of his friends over to 
entertain them for meals, and I said, no, you'll

10:42.563 --> 10:56.538
make more enemies than you make friends because 
you'll forget somebody. You'll overlook people.

10:58.581 --> 11:02.305
And that will just, if we're right here, everybody 
can see the comings and going. And I enjoyed a lot of

11:03.286 --> 11:09.853
people, but...

11:11.403 --> 11:12.825
As I said, we didn't. You know that from 
experience. You weren't invited there. I did what

11:15.770 --> 11:23.904
I had to do, but I just didn't add to anything that 
was not scheduled. Right. So y'all were not part of

11:24.926 --> 11:29.714
a bridge group or a bridge group there? No, no. We 
weren't part of a social group at all that I know of.

11:34.141 --> 11:37.427
We got along with everybody and enjoyed 
everybody, but... This sounds awful for me, but I

11:38.167 --> 11:44.293
just didn't invite people to add to anything that 
he had to do. I felt like he needed some time to

11:44.333 --> 11:48.297
relax. Sure. When you all went on vacation while 
you were in California? We looked for a place where

11:51.660 --> 11:53.422
nobody knew us. Where did you go? Do you remember? 
Yeah, we went to Callaway Gardens. We went to High

11:58.567 --> 11:59.808
Hampton. We went to visit the families. We went to 
Canada once. Did I tell you about Canada? No.

12:09.622 --> 12:34.920
uh we were oh i found out i could have turned this off 
i'm

12:09.622 --> 12:34.920
trying to think of the name of this place i think we 
were there and jack said quick quick mary was with

12:09.622 --> 12:34.920
us and he pointed out that there was a whole carload 
of aggies unloading

12:36.740 --> 12:41.286
So we went in a jewelry store and stayed a while. 
Isn't that mean? No, he didn't need to get involved

12:42.808 --> 12:45.752
when you're away. He

12:45.792 --> 12:52.981
just needed some time for us. During those A&M 
years, who were the state and federal legislators

12:55.465 --> 13:03.996
that were most helpful to Dr. Williams and to A&M? 
Who was there in Austin and Washington that was? I

13:10.337 --> 13:10.878
don't know. I know that he had one friend that was a 
budget board man. On the LBB? The budget board. He

13:22.850 --> 13:23.971
came to see him once. Did I tell you about that? No.

13:29.336 --> 13:34.742
Joe, will you go in the office and take the picture 
of the steer down and bring it in here on the wall?

13:36.899 --> 13:39.061
One day this man shows up at the office.

13:41.865 --> 13:46.050
And he was in motorcycle clothes. He came on a 
motorcycle. And he wanted to go in there and see

13:49.193 --> 13:53.578
that president. And Hilary Gaines, worked for 
Jack, said, do you have an appointment? No, but I'm

13:58.244 --> 14:02.669
going in there to see that president. And of course 
she didn't know who he was. so but she said you can't

14:05.182 --> 14:32.404
go and she got up and stood in front of the door and 
blocked it and of course

14:05.182 --> 14:32.404
neil colwell's his name i think oh i remember that 
name we're looking at a big uh looks like red angus

14:05.182 --> 14:32.404
bull And this is a drawing which Mr. Caldwell made. 
Look at that. Isn't that awful? Did he present that

14:41.159 --> 14:46.045
work of art to Dr. Williams? No, not then, but 
another time. But he went in and, of course, was

14:48.007 --> 14:56.297
very amused to think that Jack would have somebody 
that loyal to him working in an office. But Hillary

14:56.697 --> 15:02.003
literally got up and put her arms across the door 
and wouldn't let him go in. And I guess that's when

15:02.877 --> 15:05.060
he told her who he was. But he was the budget boy. 
That is the steer for the King Ranch. Sired the King

15:12.168 --> 15:13.650
Ranch. Don't you think that's interesting? Oh, 
yeah. That he thought that much of Jack, that he

15:16.513 --> 15:20.318
would give him one of his art pieces. No, I don't... 
I don't know... What about Tiger Teague? Do you

15:27.052 --> 15:27.773
remember him? Oh, yeah, Tiger Teague was a great 
help, and Catherine went to work for him in

15:27.793 --> 15:33.083
Washington after she graduated. Tiger Teague and 
Jack were friends, but I never knew what was going

15:35.427 --> 15:46.306
on as far as the business of the university and who 
you were picking up and calling. I saw Jack one time

15:46.947 --> 15:49.692
be called by somebody at the university and asking 
him to see if they could save the permanent fund did

15:50.195 --> 16:16.371
i tell you that before they couldn't get one of the 
members of the legislature in dallas they could

15:50.195 --> 16:16.371
they said they

15:50.195 --> 16:16.371
this is the reason i hate this they couldn't get to 
him could he could he did he think he could get him to

15:50.195 --> 16:16.371
vote for them to save the permanent that's when all 
the colleges wanted to break it down And Jack said,

16:17.313 --> 16:18.415
sure. So he picked up the telephone

16:18.455 --> 16:31.433
and called the head of the frozen food expense, 
Stubbs, and told him what the problem was. And he

16:31.493 --> 16:34.237
said, yes, we own him. Did you cut that off? No, we 
can work that out later. We own him. And five

16:41.487 --> 16:46.594
minutes later, he got the phone call saying that it 
was all taken care of. But the University of Texas

16:47.452 --> 16:52.097
was a strong political group. You realize that 
always. They were used to having their way

16:54.499 --> 17:01.066
regardless of what it was and what was going on. And 
Dr. Williams and Mickey LeMaitre, who was then the

17:02.727 --> 17:10.856
chancellor of the UT system, they were old 
acquaintances. They were friends, always were.

17:13.538 --> 17:14.940
And worked well together, didn't they? Mm-hmm. 
He's the one that called Jack that day about coming

17:15.717 --> 17:32.553
to the medical center, and that

17:15.717 --> 17:32.553
was on a Monday, and the next Monday we were down 
there for a business meeting with members of the

17:15.717 --> 17:32.553
hospital board. I'm not going to ask you the 
negative on this one. Of the A&M board members, who

17:38.218 --> 17:42.062
were his favorites?

17:48.893 --> 17:51.257
Mr. Zachary would be one, wouldn't he? He wasn't on 
the board. Oh, he was off the board by then? Yeah.

17:54.342 --> 17:54.442
Okay. He was on the coordinating board. You know 
what Mr. Zachary told me? What's that? I shouldn't

18:02.736 --> 18:03.637
repeat it. He told me Jack was the finest man he ever 
knew. He talked to him every week. That's the kind

18:09.026 --> 18:10.769
of thing we do want on there. To me, that... I taught 
my children what respect was by using Mr. Zachary.

18:19.594 --> 18:29.988
I told them that you have to respect the source of 
your criticism, pro or con, and that Mr. Zachary's

18:19.594 --> 18:29.988
criticism, any way it came, we would sure pay 
attention to it. We respected him. And I think

18:32.030 --> 18:35.455
that's a good way to have a good example to teach a 
child. Right. Now, if we were listing... I don't

18:38.599 --> 18:39.400
know. He had good friends on the board. And I had 
some wives that were good friends. Who? Which

18:45.474 --> 18:47.817
ones? I have a letter. I don't know what I did with 
it. He came to see us when he was in the hospital,

18:52.743 --> 19:00.072
too, in Dallas. They both died close together.

19:07.701 --> 19:09.323
She wrote me a letter once that said, 10 to 12. Where 
do you all have to be? Goodson. Goodson. Goodson.

19:17.004 --> 19:17.445
Goodson. Joe can remember. She was a good friend of 
mine, and he was a good friend. He got along okay.

19:26.237 --> 19:30.923
Now, as I say, Jack and I were not the buddy-buddy 
type people. The only person I know that he was over

19:32.253 --> 19:43.005
in former students, I think he could relax and be 
silly over there with the people that worked for

19:32.253 --> 19:43.005
him. They were such good friends and worked so hard 
for their university, and they weren't

19:43.305 --> 19:48.551
political. With Buck Wirus and Dick Hervey? Yeah, 
those people over there. But, see, we were not

19:53.196 --> 19:55.859
buddy-buddy people. I'm still not. I have good 
friends, but I've just always gone for, this goes

19:57.650 --> 20:04.298
back to my childhood. I'm sure that you always have 
a best friend, but that you don't live together.

20:11.907 --> 20:15.771
You know what I'm saying is you don't have to have, 
you don't have to have somebody around. I'll bet

20:15.811 --> 20:17.793
you all are that way. You don't have to have 
somebody in the house every night. What were his

20:22.018 --> 20:25.763
favorite foods when you were going to feed him? 
What? What was his favorite food? What did he enjoy

20:29.740 --> 20:32.924
most? Well, what we had the most were 
Williamsburgers. What's a Williamsburger? Yes.

20:41.853 --> 20:42.514
A hamburger. But what made it a Williamsburger? It 
was made by Jack Williams. He could put, even at the

20:49.181 --> 20:52.665
last years of our life, We were going to have a 
hamburger, which we had our meat special ground

20:52.898 --> 20:57.847
for. It wasn't a hamburger. We went to the butcher 
and had him grind our meat. Jack had put one

21:05.701 --> 21:13.354
together that was juicy and delicious and just 
wonderful, and he had his own recipe, which he put

21:05.701 --> 21:13.354
egg in his hamburgers. But one of my nieces named 
them Williamsburgers and we always had

21:13.958 --> 21:21.628
Williamsburgers. Now what else went on the 
Williamsburger other than meat? Lettuce and

21:25.973 --> 21:26.914
tomato. We'd have lettuce and tomato, nothing 
else. No onions ever. Mayonnaise. But mustard

21:32.300 --> 21:36.185
went in the making of Williamsburgers. Mustard, 
egg, and salt went in the making of

21:36.485 --> 21:40.090
Williamsburgers. Right. Let's make believe that 
you know he's going to have a long, tiresome day,

21:40.670 --> 21:51.023
and you want to feed him an evening meal that you 
know he'll really enjoy. What would you have

21:51.103 --> 21:52.244
served? No telling. We ate normal food and 
balanced meals. I still have a balanced meal.

22:01.873 --> 22:06.701
Every meal for myself is a balanced meal because 
that's your health. And I tried to take care of

22:06.761 --> 22:08.124
Jack. Jack had health problems before we ever 
heard of Texas.

22:15.256 --> 22:17.260
And so, I mean, I... I bought sirloin tip roasts and 
we had potatoes and we had, you know, another dish

22:18.117 --> 22:38.472
that was easy and it's off my diet now was open a can 
of baked beans, pork and beans, pour a lot of

22:18.117 --> 22:38.472
ketchup on top and onion slices all over the top and 
bake it. Now, that was an old standby. Homemade

22:40.294 --> 22:43.518
applesauce. We had a lot of applesauce. We had a lot 
of cabbage slaw. We never cooked cabbage. You

22:49.265 --> 22:51.648
know, it's just good old... Were there some foods 
that you knew he didn't like?

22:58.416 --> 23:00.599
It's been so long, he wasn't a complainer. He 
finally didn't like apricot bread.

23:10.396 --> 23:18.186
Whatever he did like was so routine that I just 
never had to give a great thought to anything. I fed

23:18.206 --> 23:23.714
my children vegetables and good meat. Oh, back in 
those days we had a lot of fried chicken. Remember

23:26.317 --> 23:28.260
when fried chicken was okay to eat? And I was real 
good at that. But now I barbecue outside

23:32.105 --> 23:40.015
chicken thighs. which is the difference you see in 
the way we cook now, what we did then. But it was okay

23:45.452 --> 23:48.855
then to have fried chicken, and that was good. How 
long has it been since you fried chicken? About 20

23:52.700 --> 23:53.440
years. Did he have some favorite desserts?

24:01.609 --> 24:04.913
This is interesting to me that you wanted to know 
these details. We're trying to learn. See, we want

24:06.915 --> 24:09.078
to learn all we can about the person. Uh-huh.

24:18.132 --> 24:23.018
There was always ice cream and Ms. McCauley's 
Pound Cake. This is a recipe for a pound cake that

24:23.138 --> 24:28.944
Hugh McCauley's mother made. And that's the 
reason it was called Ms. McCauley's Pound Cake.

24:34.010 --> 24:40.157
But no, Jack just didn't require a lot of anything 
because we... Things just agreed on between us. We

24:43.971 --> 24:48.776
didn't say Jack Spratt could eat no fat and his wife 
could eat no lean. We didn't do like that. Whatever

24:52.160 --> 24:53.561
was there was there. He cooked breakfast a lot of 
the times for us, for the girls and so forth. He got

25:00.990 --> 25:02.752
home first. He cooked dinner if I was out taking a 
child to orthodontist or something like that. He

25:08.378 --> 25:09.199
came home He didn't sit down and wait for me to come 
home. He cooked a lot of meals.

25:18.298 --> 25:20.980
My wife was asking me if I was listening to that. 
Well, this was because he had a working mother. He

25:25.184 --> 25:27.646
had a working mother, and he didn't sit around and 
wait for her. In fact, he used to have to go to the

25:27.746 --> 25:35.893
drugstore and let his mother go home for supper, 
and he ran the drugstore while his parents went

25:27.746 --> 25:35.893
home to eat. And then he had to be back. at 9.30 to 
help them close. Jack was a person who had every

25:40.016 --> 25:57.660
hour of his day, even as a young man, programmed 
with school and he participated in things, you

25:40.016 --> 25:57.660
know, and played football and helped with the drug 
store and had a paper route in the morning. He was

25:57.680 --> 26:01.545
brought up to be programmed by the hour. And I told 
you the last time about his mother saying she cried

26:02.234 --> 26:10.246
when she had to bundle him up and send him out in this 
terrible weather to deliver his papers. And when

26:10.786 --> 26:13.670
he told me about it, his was a different story. I 
just tried to be in a certain place on the hill to see

26:13.951 --> 26:21.642
the sun come up, and then one of his customers 
always had him in for a cup of hot chocolate. So he

26:22.864 --> 26:28.011
was, you know, he had a good youth with a very strict 
father. And I think all this program showed. This

26:31.116 --> 26:32.157
is why he never... complained about things. He 
just kept it all to himself if it was bad. As that

26:37.285 --> 26:47.074
while he was president of A&M with that very 
demanding schedule where did he keep his his daily

26:37.285 --> 26:47.074
schedule? Was it in a little book as I have mine? 
There was there something he carried in his

26:49.836 --> 26:51.778
pocket? I have those all in a drawer. Okay and so he 
would check that if someone asked him about can you

26:53.520 --> 27:02.008
come to this kind of a meeting he would check that 
little I don't know. He had his schedule and little

27:03.603 --> 27:06.886
tiny writing in them. And sometimes I have one 
matchbook where he took notes at a meeting. I

27:14.374 --> 27:17.577
wanted to send it to Dick Linerty. It's still back 
there in my desk drawer, the matchbook where he

27:18.457 --> 27:22.101
took notes at a meeting. And it was something about 
the medical center, planning for the medical

27:23.002 --> 27:28.227
center. So evidently he was...

27:32.836 --> 27:36.579
That's what he had to write in was that matchbook, 
and that's where he wrote them. And it was in his

27:37.400 --> 27:40.062
desk drawer, and it still is. It's

27:41.103 --> 27:49.210
hard to describe Jack because he could... I told 
him, just turn it off. Let me turn this back on. How

27:56.817 --> 27:58.678
did you all meet John Lindsay? Do you remember when 
you first became acquainted with John and Sarah

27:58.719 --> 28:02.742
Lindsay?

28:09.607 --> 28:10.388
No, I don't. As I told you, we weren't... See, even 
the people that came after football games and so

28:11.349 --> 28:20.899
forth were lots of times people that I hardly knew. 
We were invited to the Lindsay's once in Houston to

28:20.919 --> 28:33.713
dinner, and we got there real... See, it came 
through John to Jack, and nothing in writing, no

28:20.919 --> 28:33.713
phone call from her. And we showed up too early. And 
so she made it clear that she had work to do in order

28:36.539 --> 28:43.931
to cook for us. And we left and then came back. She 
suggested that we come back or something like

28:45.674 --> 28:48.118
that. But I just was pulled along, which I often 
was. I never got on an airplane if Jack didn't have

28:53.286 --> 28:57.653
in writing an invitation for me. When he went on the 
airplane, I was never there unless it was

28:58.747 --> 29:03.338
something that I was supposed to attend. And I 
showed up then for that without any prior

29:04.260 --> 29:08.951
information. Lots of times I did. Recently, the 
Heisman Trophy Award that came to Walker while we

29:10.535 --> 29:16.148
were in it, Houston while we were in College 
Station, remember Walker getting the Heisman

29:16.550 --> 29:21.795
winning. I went to that banquet when he praised his 
mother and there were three tears of, I'd never

29:22.396 --> 29:28.962
heard of the Heisman Award. I didn't know what I was 
at now and I've got a copy of it now out of that Texas

29:29.763 --> 29:38.051
A&M book. I can't remember what tier I was sitting 
at, probably the lowest tier. But the Maltz

29:43.263 --> 29:52.059
brothers, Melvin Maltz and his brother, were very 
involved in that Heisman Award that night. And

29:52.419 --> 29:55.405
Walker gave great credit to his mother, as usual. 
But until recently, I'd never known the

29:55.805 --> 30:00.053
background for the Heisman trophy. Have you? Not 
really. and who Heisman was and so forth. It's real

30:04.679 --> 30:05.640
interesting. And it might even be right here where 
I can... Oh, I forget, I can't... It might be

30:10.445 --> 30:11.245
pulled... I tore it out of the paper. It's right 
behind those books there, down there below. Let's

30:15.910 --> 30:20.795
go back to John Lindsay. He just was never a person 
not to just show up and help. That's what he's still

30:25.720 --> 30:27.982
doing. And, no, it'd be on the other stool back 
there. I may have carried it back to the office, but

30:33.820 --> 30:38.406
anyway, I'll mail it to you. I'll make a copy and 
mail it to you. I just don't know when he came into my

30:40.588 --> 30:47.997
paying attention to him. They were always nice 
people, but even at the reception

30:48.458 --> 30:58.270
last week for the press, they're just there. He 
doesn't... She is...

31:05.950 --> 31:10.476
I think a very involved person, but nothing pushy 
about her. And he's just pushy about Texas A&M, as

31:11.257 --> 31:15.101
far as I know. He's successful. And they lost one of 
their sons.

31:22.130 --> 31:26.275
And he was in the hospital when Jack was with his 
heart attack. And I got John's birthday cake. He

31:29.920 --> 31:32.883
sent a cake up to us, and I didn't know it. And we took 
the cake. Even though Catherine did wish she could

31:34.655 --> 31:40.364
have one piece, we took it up and gave it to the 
people that were taking care of Jack. We gave his

31:40.404 --> 31:41.927
birthday cake away. And then later on, he said he 
didn't get a birthday cake. They asked for

31:45.653 --> 31:46.534
something. I said, oh, we gave it away. But their 
son had his back operation, and I went out and

31:49.439 --> 32:01.658
bought him a cactus, carried it in,

31:49.439 --> 32:01.658
which I thought was something for a young person, 
you know, to grow it.
