WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:03.049
This is occurring between 36 and 40. 36 and 40. And I 
take it you were doing the testing of the camera in

00:05.052 --> 00:08.337
39, is that right? Oh, we started that about 38, I 
believe. Okay. I'm not quite sure. That was about

00:17.410 --> 00:19.894
38, the first camera. Now, was your work really in 
seismic testing? Was this leading to your

00:23.679 --> 00:26.363
master's thesis? No. I just never thought about 
thesis here. Okay. But I just didn't worry about

00:32.249 --> 00:36.193
such things as that. I was interested in working on 
this program and we realized that when the time

00:36.273 --> 00:58.135
came that I was supposed to get a degree where then I 
would take some hunk of this large piece of work we

00:36.273 --> 00:58.135
were doing and call that my thesis and write it up on 
that basis. Then a

00:59.887 --> 01:10.478
geology professor from the University of 
Virginia was a very good friend of Franklin

00:59.887 --> 01:10.478
Roosevelt's. He talked Roosevelt into

01:12.259 --> 01:20.147
sponsoring a year's expedition in the South 
Pacific. We were going to go in the Alexander

01:21.008 --> 01:29.016
Hamilton, one of the great 327-foot Coast Guard 
cutters.

01:30.245 --> 01:43.223
Summer of 39, I guess it was, we all just worked like 
dogs getting ready for that because we were going

01:30.245 --> 01:43.223
to spend two months in each of the major island 
groups in the South Pacific. That was canceled

01:43.243 --> 01:54.058
about three days before sailing time because of 
the war clouds. It was probably unfortunate,

01:54.882 --> 02:02.512
because if we'd gone through with it, we would have 
probably learned a good deal more about the South

01:54.882 --> 02:02.512
Pacific before we moved into it. I think in summing 
up some of the educational

02:04.935 --> 02:22.577
things, I was interested in geophysics and sort of 
problem-oriented.

02:22.844 --> 02:35.701
Curricula was really one pretty much of classical 
physics, which I wasn't very much interested in,

02:22.844 --> 02:35.701
which was probably not very smart of me, but I was. 
And I never really worried very much about whether

02:35.721 --> 02:40.167
I got a degree or not. That was very secondary.

02:46.516 --> 02:51.062
We had some very fine professors in the 
university. And I think one of the things we

02:52.493 --> 03:02.064
learned, a great deal of versatility in getting 
things done. There was very little money. Partly

03:03.666 --> 03:05.488
you had to do it yourself. Partly you designed 
according to what you could do. The facilities

03:11.815 --> 03:17.281
that you had, the lathes or machine shops you had. 
Incidentally, much of the work was done after

03:17.301 --> 03:20.965
midnight because Only then could you break out 
your bogus master keys and so forth. And I want to

03:25.831 --> 03:43.958
pay special tribute to the many service, 
wonderful service people in universities and so

03:25.831 --> 03:43.958
forth that help you along the mechanics, the 
policemen, and people like that who oftentimes

03:25.831 --> 03:43.958
make life far more livable. For six months, I lived 
illegally in the laboratory. slept on the floor in

03:51.151 --> 03:53.374
my research lab. And many is the time the policeman 
would open up the gymnasium in the middle of the

03:53.574 --> 04:01.224
night so we could take showers after working. And 
many is the night he came into my room and closed the

04:01.304 --> 04:11.837
windows if it was raining or snowing on me, even 
though I was engaged in illicit behavior. Those

04:14.280 --> 04:20.348
are things one remembers a long time.

04:22.775 --> 04:35.411
Ewing

04:22.775 --> 04:35.411
and Islin, of course, got to know each other in 
their respective work. We were going out on the

04:35.431 --> 04:37.353
Atlantis. And Islin was very involved

04:38.535 --> 04:51.651
in international matters and concerns. after the 
war had broken out in Europe, it seemed inevitable

04:52.188 --> 05:00.038
that we were going to get into it. And he put in a 
proposal to the

05:02.442 --> 05:21.807
National Research Council to

05:02.442 --> 05:21.807
get the oceanographic involved in the field of 
underwater sound and so forth. He turned to Morris

05:22.175 --> 05:33.055
Ewing because Ewing was a contemporary who was 
experienced in seagoing work, experienced in

05:22.175 --> 05:33.055
geophysics and underwater sound. In 1940,

05:33.075 --> 05:42.192
fall of 1940, I think it was October, after we came 
back from a trip on the Atlantis down to

05:42.863 --> 06:08.766
Jacksonville, testing our, using our seismic and 
camera equipment, this contract appeared to go

05:42.863 --> 06:08.766
through, and Warzel, Ewing, and Bob McCurdy and I 
came from Lehigh up to Woods Hole to go to work on

05:42.863 --> 06:08.766
this. Are you talking about a contract for 
anti-submarine warfare? It was a contract for

06:13.137 --> 06:16.280
anti-submarine, basically anti-submarine 
warfare work. And this is in October 1940? This is

06:17.982 --> 06:19.203
in October of 1940. The

06:19.263 --> 06:42.486
first job, well at that moment I guess one could say 
the first job was that Ewing went up to talk to Islin

06:19.263 --> 06:42.486
and he telephoned back from Woods Hole and said the 
deal had gone through. that could Wurzel and I

06:43.327 --> 06:48.472
clean out the laboratory and get up there in 48 
hours. So we hired a five-ton truck and took

06:49.713 --> 07:00.644
everything apart in 48 hours, of which about 12 
hours, many hours, consisted of taking library

06:49.713 --> 07:00.644
books back to the library.

07:04.508 --> 07:08.912
The primary job there at Woods Hole And I might say a 
word about Woods Hole. This was at the end of the

07:11.866 --> 07:13.348
summer. The building was almost completely 
empty. The Atlantis with her crew of 13 or 14 people

07:19.037 --> 07:23.784
was about. There were about five other people in 
the oceanographic building, and we had it pretty

07:25.546 --> 07:32.537
much to ourselves.

07:36.955 --> 07:46.330
The general understanding of sound transmission 
through the water was the primary problem we

07:36.955 --> 07:46.330
devoted ourselves to. The theory of it, trying to 
get the,

07:46.350 --> 08:03.317
with principal emphasis on the bathymograph for 
shallow water and looking at historical records

07:46.350 --> 08:03.317
for deep water conditions. We sort of divided the 
effort, but everybody worked on, rotated and

08:04.293 --> 08:14.788
almost everybody worked on every piece of it from 
time to time. One of my principal concerns was to

08:16.831 --> 08:31.212
see if we could convert the bath thermograph from 
working at four knots to see if we could make it work

08:16.831 --> 08:31.212
at 15 knots and to go deeper and to make it more 
reliable. and to build winches so it could do this

08:32.069 --> 08:35.536
also.

08:39.064 --> 08:50.828
The other problem which Ewing spearheaded, but we 
all spent a great deal of time on it, was the

08:39.064 --> 08:50.828
refraction of sound in seawater. And actually, 
from the first of October to February, when the

08:54.867 --> 09:13.249
report was written of sound transmission in 
seawater, which was, I believe, an extremely fine

08:54.867 --> 09:13.249
and fundamental document, even to this day, as 
elementary as it was, why it was still a basically

08:54.867 --> 09:13.249
sound document.

09:16.934 --> 09:23.642
Clearly building on other work that had been done 
by other people and so forth, but tying it

09:16.934 --> 09:23.642
together.

09:26.609 --> 09:31.656
There is a certain amount of unfairness in many 
things. The people at Scripps and at the Naval

09:31.757 --> 09:42.432
Electronics Laboratory in San Diego were working 
on the same problem.

09:45.457 --> 09:53.629
I guess we beat them to the press by a very short 
length of time, and perhaps it was a little more a

09:54.098 --> 10:08.234
little more complete, and certainly the report 
that Woods Hole put out, which was largely a result

09:54.098 --> 10:08.234
of Ewing and Islin combining physics and 
oceanography on a problem. It was the teamwork of

10:08.754 --> 10:21.709
that group, and certainly my involvement was 
support rather than the major part of it. That was a

10:21.959 --> 10:24.562
very monumental document at that time.

10:27.445 --> 10:33.232
The point I want to make is that the people on the 
West Coast were doing very much of the same kind of

10:27.445 --> 10:33.232
work with a somewhat different tack. And the work 
they did supported it, broadened the field, and so

10:34.053 --> 10:41.322
forth. Well,

10:42.503 --> 10:51.814
during that war period, as the institution grew, 
you took on all sorts of jobs. And versatility was

10:55.819 --> 10:57.724
the game here. Underwater sound was by all odds the 
principal part of it. Excuse me, you stayed at

11:05.075 --> 11:09.940
Woods Hole then from 40 to 45 doing any submarine 
research? Yes. Okay. Now, but you're in Operation

11:12.563 --> 11:14.545
Crossroad in 46? Yes. Right, okay. Now, did Ewing 
stay between 40 and 45 here too? Ewing was here all

11:20.111 --> 11:24.435
through then until he left in 46, spring of 46. 
Spring of 46. Yes.

11:30.141 --> 11:31.082
What about Revell? Ravel was at Scripps, and then 
he, working closely with the Naval Electronics

11:32.412 --> 11:44.867
Laboratory, it became the Naval Electronics 
Laboratory, also an underwater sound

11:32.412 --> 11:44.867
oceanography. Then he got in the Navy as an 
officer, and he went to Washington. And here I

11:51.856 --> 11:59.526
think the important thing is that Ravel was Mr. 
Oceanography in Washington. There was no

11:59.826 --> 12:01.508
question about that. one of the things in which the 
country as a whole was fortunate, and certainly as

12:02.669 --> 12:25.955
an individual I was very fortunate, to have this 
great triumvirate of smart, concerned

12:02.669 --> 12:25.955
scientists, Morris Ewing, Roger Revelle, and 
Columbus Isley. Okay, now what all these

12:26.075 --> 12:30.600
questions are leading to is, what I really want to 
know is, when did you first meet Revelle? I would

12:32.386 --> 12:37.252
say I probably met Revelle in about 42. Okay. Well, 
good. Possibly earlier. I'm not sure of this. Is

12:42.978 --> 12:44.460
this through Granny's submarine work? Yes. Okay. 
Well, I had met him before. Yeah. But just at

12:48.405 --> 12:52.570
meetings, and I didn't know him before. Okay. When 
I got to know Revelle was when you, you know, after

12:54.192 --> 13:01.380
working until 6 o'clock in the morning with... all 
day long until 6 o'clock in the morning with people

13:02.103 --> 13:08.522
time after time, that's when you get to know them. 
He told me he met you during the war in any submarine

13:08.542 --> 13:11.591
war. Yes. Okay. And I wasn't trying to mislead you 
on the tape, but I somehow or another assumed that

13:13.105 --> 13:22.697
he had met you when he had come, when you guys had 
done it together. So I placed you out at the Pacific

13:22.717 --> 13:24.659
for a while. No. Okay. No, he was Mr. Oceanography 
there, and we had perhaps met then, but I didn't

13:26.382 --> 13:35.953
really get to know him until he got to Washington.

13:39.177 --> 13:41.681
What sort of work were you doing in ASMRing warfare 
with acoustics? What were you looking for?

13:46.265 --> 13:55.316
The basic problem was, from the physics 
standpoint of it, the basic scientific point of

13:46.265 --> 13:55.316
view was to study the transmission of sound 
through the ocean. That was the basic title of

13:57.198 --> 14:07.791
contracts that Ravel led to about three 
laboratories for about one decade or a decade and a

13:57.198 --> 14:07.791
half. This was the simple statement that 
justified the expenditure of at least half of the

14:09.373 --> 14:15.360
money going into oceanography. It was 
interpreted very broadly by all the people

14:17.382 --> 14:20.124
concerned. And usually, if you take almost any 
broad problem, and in fundamental problem,

14:21.746 --> 14:35.618
interpret it broadly, and tackle it 
intelligently, that ends up by taking in about

14:21.746 --> 14:35.618
half of oceanography. And this was the case. I 
wanted to come back to this, saying that I believe

14:40.462 --> 14:46.748
the country as a whole was very lucky. that Ewing, 
Revelle, and Islin were a trio of three wonderful

14:47.757 --> 15:10.682
people, talented people, that were fortunate 
enough to be able to stay together, I mean to

14:47.757 --> 15:10.682
operate, and they were, the three together, were 
really Mr. Oceanography for about 15 years. They

15:11.703 --> 15:17.089
were all highly respected by military people, 
congressmen, laymen, and so forth. They were

15:20.944 --> 15:24.351
educated people, educated and concerned. And it 
was this coherence in the business that was so very

15:25.213 --> 15:30.784
important. In the field of oceanography during 
the war, first with the elementary fundamental

15:37.133 --> 15:43.061
parts on the sound transmission, then getting the 
equipment. We had classes of junior naval

15:43.962 --> 16:00.104
officers come to Woods Hole, and in one week we gave 
them a taste of what they were supposed to tell

15:43.962 --> 16:00.104
their superiors when they took the bath 
thermograph and put it out in the fleet.

16:00.124 --> 16:04.390
Incidentally, we built about 250 bath 
thermographs here in Woods Hole in our shops.

16:04.825 --> 16:08.629
waiting for production people to get them into 
production. I was sort of Revell's manager for the

16:10.030 --> 16:22.343
bath thermographic equipment, commercial bath 
thermographic equipment and winches and so forth

16:10.030 --> 16:22.343
in commercial production. So I spent about 20% of 
my time on that.

16:34.019 --> 16:45.310
Bureau of Ordinance, long about this time, fairly 
early in the war, in fact, very early in the war, the

16:34.019 --> 16:45.310
Ordinance Department came to us with underwater 
photography. For example, shortly after Pearl

16:46.351 --> 16:58.784
Harbor, we were accosted to see how practical was 
it to make a photographic mosaic every day of the

16:46.351 --> 16:58.784
bottom of the entrance to Pearl Harbor.

17:01.667 --> 17:02.187
For About one month, nearly all other projects 
around here were dropped while we worked on that

17:04.073 --> 17:11.941
project. Some of the earliest underwater 
television, some of the early television was put

17:11.961 --> 17:31.060
in cases and put underwater, and we learned how to 
manipulate it and so forth in ways that were very

17:11.961 --> 17:31.060
crude and probably wouldn't have done the job very 
well. it would have done it some.

17:37.631 --> 17:55.668
Furthermore, when the Navy thought they had sunk a 
submarine, a German submarine along our coast, we

17:37.631 --> 17:55.668
ended up with the job of taking one of our ships out 
and having our people go out and see if they could

17:37.631 --> 17:55.668
photograph the wreck and determine what 
submarine it was. Usually it was a collier sunk in

17:55.808 --> 17:58.311
the previous war. But That certainly produced a 
great deal of field work and an acquaintance with

18:00.267 --> 18:10.959
the problems of field work. One of the interesting 
things about this, this was an era in which a great

18:10.979 --> 18:19.168
many young people came through and got acquainted 
with oceanography. John Ewing, Rusty Tyree, a

18:20.330 --> 18:27.017
large number of young people who were here for a 
while, then went off to war or other places in

18:27.875 --> 18:34.824
education and came back into the game later on.

18:41.192 --> 18:45.838
Then I spent some time on submarines, both in the 
photographic game and the sound transmission

18:41.192 --> 18:45.838
game. But then we got involved with the, when I say 
we, Woods Hole, Ewing, Islin, and so forth, with

18:58.165 --> 19:02.892
building bath thermographs for submarines, 
because it was felt submarines needed a bath

18:58.165 --> 19:02.892
thermograph.

19:06.798 --> 19:09.262
We designed up about four models. Ewing and I were 
doing most of this work, because at that time,

19:09.462 --> 19:17.735
Warzel was more heavily involved in the 
photography. We built about four models of bath

19:19.197 --> 19:24.105
thermographs, which were tested in Key West. And 
one rather interesting part about that, I believe

19:26.515 --> 19:36.309
model number four was finally accepted by the Navy 
as being okay to put into production. We received

19:38.132 --> 19:39.754
that word on a Thursday. Also on Thursday, Ewing 
and I figured we knew how the thing really should be

19:39.794 --> 19:48.827
built. And so we redesigned the submarine 
bathymograph. We built models. We tested the

19:56.280 --> 19:58.742
devil out of them all weekend. And Monday morning, 
the manufacturers, the Bristol company, came

19:59.763 --> 20:05.990
around, sent by the Navy to put the instrument in 
production. And we put the new untested model in

20:06.230 --> 20:10.895
production.

20:14.558 --> 20:20.164
This sounds more horrible now than it did in those 
days, because in those days, there was a greater

20:14.558 --> 20:20.164
tendency to do what you thought was right. And the

20:22.260 --> 20:31.130
idea of operating by committee was still pretty 
remote. But if I may knock on wood, we were very

20:31.971 --> 20:48.750
lucky on that, because that ended up being a best 
demographic to which, to my knowledge, only two of

20:31.971 --> 20:48.750
them ever quit on patrol.

20:49.085 --> 20:57.054
There were, of course, some 40 submarines that 
never came back, but presumably only a few. The

20:57.114 --> 21:04.923
bath thermograph for submarines was exceedingly 
important. And I think it was exceedingly

21:04.943 --> 21:09.528
important to the history of oceanography. I'm 
probably guilty of overstating this, and I put it

21:09.548 --> 21:18.518
into the history because I think it is important 
item for historians to think about. It

21:20.910 --> 21:38.892
was important because it was an instrument that 
was generally located within a few feet of the

21:20.910 --> 21:38.892
commanding officer when he was at his command 
stations. It was an instrument that not only

21:38.912 --> 21:44.218
helped

21:47.084 --> 21:52.631
excuse me, what the instrument did, it gave an 
indication of temperature versus depth. It was on

21:52.651 --> 21:55.595
a little smoke three-by-five card. It was 
generally within a few feet of the commanding

21:57.417 --> 22:00.141
officer. If there was a temperature gradient, it 
indicated a customary thing of isothermal water,

22:02.263 --> 22:11.215
a temperature gradient, and then rolled 
isothermal water below. It indicated that sound

22:12.056 --> 22:15.400
conditions above might be good. If the submarine 
got below... that then your chances of evasion

22:17.628 --> 22:21.215
would be much greater. And there is no question 
about it. Any instrument that helps a man survive

22:23.860 --> 22:28.549
is going to be an instrument that is respected. An 
instrument that helps them make an attack is also

22:30.874 --> 22:37.527
going to be respected.

22:39.515 --> 23:01.877
The submarine people clearly understood that the 
ocean was three-dimensional, and I believe it was

22:39.515 --> 23:01.877
this simpatico relationship between 
oceanographers and submarine people, with a bath

22:39.515 --> 23:01.877
thermograph being the device that did it more than 
anything else, meant that when the war was over,

22:39.515 --> 23:01.877
the A large number of submarine people who were 
some of the Navy's best, not by any means their only

23:02.414 --> 23:16.812
best, but some of their best, were firm believers 
in the bath thermograph and pretty firm believers

23:02.414 --> 23:16.812
in oceanography. Incidentally, I think that the 
best recommendation that the bath thermograph

23:18.934 --> 23:27.645
ever received, and it was certainly a tribute to 
oceanography,

23:31.338 --> 23:51.104
The one captain said that when he had been 
executive officer and when they had made an attack

23:31.338 --> 23:51.104
off the island of Truk, which was in trade wind 
country with deep ice thermal water, they knew

23:31.338 --> 23:51.104
they would take a pasting because sound 
conditions were excellent and they stood a very

23:31.338 --> 23:51.104
good chance of getting sunk. The submarine made 
their attack. They dove, and as they passed about

23:53.587 --> 23:56.451
100 feet, the executive officer leaned over with 
his finger and put a false negative gradient on the

23:58.051 --> 24:11.063
bath thermograph because he figured that way the 
crew would see it and they would feel better. And

24:13.005 --> 24:16.768
there was a man that understood both the bath 
thermograph and he understood his crew. Along

24:19.491 --> 24:26.337
about the time that Ewing and Warzel time we were 
all getting involved in sound channel work, the

24:26.941 --> 24:35.571
importance of the sound channel might exist.

24:39.095 --> 24:52.451
I had started working with the submarine people, 
and it seemed to me that with the submarine bath

24:39.095 --> 24:52.451
demograph and the submarine people, 
Oceanography stood a chance to do some real good.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.935
Here were some people that had an opportunity to 
use oceanographic information in a way that

24:56.928 --> 25:04.638
destroyer people cannot, because the destroyer 
man cannot dive to take advantage of temperature

24:56.928 --> 25:04.638
gradients.

25:07.562 --> 25:16.234
Therefore, I pretty much committed my time 
exclusively to the submarine bath thermograph

25:07.562 --> 25:16.234
for most of the rest of the war. At this time, along 
about this One of my regrets then was that I had to

25:23.337 --> 25:47.083
get out of the experimental acoustic business and 
working with Ewing and Islin on the sound channel

25:23.337 --> 25:47.083
work, which turned out to be so extremely 
important, although it did not turn out to be

25:23.337 --> 25:47.083
useful during the war.

25:48.312 --> 26:16.969
A small group of us at Woods Hole, starting with 
Bill Chevelle, myself, and Bumpus, and Ewing

25:48.312 --> 26:16.969
some, under the general cognizance of Dr. 
Redfield, General Direction,

25:48.312 --> 26:16.969
we tried to ride each American submarine on it, and 
some foreigners on it, some foreign submarines on

25:48.312 --> 26:16.969
their deep dives out of local test areas and so 
forth, to indoctrinate the crew about the bath

26:17.270 --> 26:42.028
thermograph, to talk to them about its use in 
underwater sound, about its use in diving,

26:17.270 --> 26:42.028
because we had been asked by the Navy to see if 
oceanographic information could be of help to

26:17.270 --> 26:42.028
them in diving through density gradients they 
found that had provided serious density

26:43.460 --> 26:47.405
anomalies in the diving of submarines. A 
difference of one part in a thousand in the density

26:48.586 --> 26:59.160
of water represents a difference of about two tons 
in the buoyancy of the submarine. And normally a

27:00.061 --> 27:07.070
submarine has to pump when it goes deep, but in the 
summer, oftentimes it had to flood. These could

27:08.091 --> 27:12.977
have serious implications in the operation of the 
submarine. And when they all had noisy pumps, it

27:13.497 --> 27:18.283
made a tremendous amount of difference to the 
noise they made.

27:21.447 --> 27:39.370
We visited a wide variety of places, mostly New 
London, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Manitowoc,

27:21.447 --> 27:39.370
Wisconsin, Key West, a little bit in Panama, and 
Mare Island in California. giving lectures to

27:40.109 --> 28:07.939
submarine groups, but writing the submarines, 
taking information that would relate to how much

27:40.109 --> 28:07.939
the submarines compressed, because the 
submarine hull compresses

27:40.109 --> 28:07.939
more than water does.

28:08.425 --> 28:28.428
It took about a year's work to bring simple theory 
and observations and a line of rationale and a line

28:08.425 --> 28:28.428
of education and manuals so we could get this 
information across to submarine people. I think

28:29.630 --> 28:31.632
most of this was pretty useful. Many submarine 
people found it extremely useful. Many found it

28:37.604 --> 28:39.526
was largely irrelevant. Much of this, some of this 
depended upon their personality, but mostly

28:40.467 --> 28:48.695
depended upon the areas they were operating in and 
the particular situation jobs they had. But

28:50.877 --> 28:53.620
submarine people were certainly very receptive. 
I found nearly all aspects of working with

28:54.681 --> 28:58.345
submarine people were very instructive and very 
worthwhile, and I had tremendous respect for

28:58.865 --> 29:03.933
them. In 1944, I went out to Pearl Harbor as the 
first of the oceanographers to go out. This was at

29:13.990 --> 29:22.964
the request of Ravel, although it was under his 
sponsorship, actually. We'd tried to get out

29:23.886 --> 29:25.969
earlier, but he had worked very hard in trying to 
get arrangements for us to go all the way to

29:26.337 --> 29:35.318
Australia, but this meant we got out to Pearl about 
two months later than we might have otherwise.
