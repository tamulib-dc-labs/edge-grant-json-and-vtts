WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:04.677
This is test, test, test.

00:07.881 --> 00:08.442
Okay, now.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.686
Test, test, one, two, three, one, two, three, test.

00:13.067 --> 00:14.709
This is September 26th.

00:15.130 --> 00:25.903
We're at 502 Crestwood at the dining table at Jack Arane's beautiful home, chatting with him about his A&M experiences.

00:26.238 --> 00:28.423
And honey is taking notes down here.

00:29.105 --> 00:40.012
To begin with, Jack, introduce yourself by giving a biographical summary of your parents, where'd you grow up, where'd you go to high school.

00:41.094 --> 00:43.099
Tell about yourself before you went away to college.

00:43.754 --> 00:58.742
My name is Jack Raines, class of 60, Thomas Jefferson Haskell in Port Arthur, 56, born to Otis B. Raines and Margie Morris in Waco, Texas, 23 November 37.

00:59.347 --> 01:07.536
Dad was a pioneer man for Duncan Coffee Company out of Houston, and he opened up new territories.

01:08.337 --> 01:14.004
When I would go to a new school, which was at least every two years, they would always ask, is your father a preacher?

01:14.104 --> 01:17.488
Because they'd look at my transcript, and we moved around.

01:17.548 --> 01:26.518
And so preacher's kids and salesman's kids, Dad would go and hire a group of people, get that set up, then go to the next thing.

01:26.538 --> 01:28.020
So we lived...

01:28.000 --> 01:34.772
in Waxahachie Temple, Wichita Falls, Orange, and Port Arthur.

01:35.233 --> 01:42.887
And you gain a set of skills when you move a lot.

01:44.032 --> 02:06.085
When I took psychology and they explained the pecking order, I understood it because I soon learned that when you go to a new town, the best thing that you can do is find the meanest guy in town and challenge him to a fight after school because either you're going to whip him and everybody's going to leave you alone or you're going to get whipped and everybody's going to say, gee, I'm scared of that guy.

02:06.426 --> 02:07.227
I've got to take a break.

02:07.267 --> 02:07.828
Yes, dear.

02:08.669 --> 02:09.330
Keep going.

02:10.053 --> 02:20.307
So the worst thing that can happen is you lose and then everybody else in the pecking order who was afraid of the guy to begin with, it at least gets you to number two.

02:20.948 --> 02:24.913
And it was a lot easier than starting on the other end and working your way up.

02:26.034 --> 02:39.132
And that's held me in good stead through life because going about things a conventional way.

02:39.415 --> 02:40.557
is not my style.

02:41.418 --> 02:43.842
And I've analyzed that, and I think that's where that started.

02:43.862 --> 02:49.852
The other thing is also trying to tell a lot of jokes, because if people laugh, you're going to fit in easier.

02:50.753 --> 02:55.521
And I think that's why I developed a reputation of being the class clown.

02:57.705 --> 03:05.878
But in any event, I was blessed with a wonderful father and mother who my dad

03:06.314 --> 03:20.734
His parents did not have a high school education and valued education and dad graduated high school and always read and believed in self-improvement.

03:20.814 --> 03:26.382
My mother was one of 13 children and

03:26.665 --> 03:38.843
in a farm in East Texas, announced to her mother and dad one night at the supper table that she had about to graduate high school and she had decided she wanted to go to the new college they were starting over in Nacogdoches.

03:39.965 --> 03:42.990
And so Mama and Papa, she said, talked about it every night.

03:43.030 --> 03:46.335
They could hear them because, you know, everyone had a little old clapboard house.

03:47.557 --> 03:51.222
And three days later at breakfast, Papa said,

03:51.202 --> 03:53.326
Sister, you be ready tomorrow morning.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.427
We're going to college.

03:54.447 --> 03:55.509
So at 3 a.m.

03:55.549 --> 04:01.840
they were up, hitched up the team and went and traveled all day and camped outside of Nacogdoches.

04:01.980 --> 04:08.451
The next morning they got up early and mother said we dusted ourselves off real good.

04:09.646 --> 04:15.455
pulled up, and Papa asked who was in charge, and they directed him to the man that was the new president.

04:15.615 --> 04:21.364
He gave him $26 in butter and egg money and his daughter, and they said, we'll handle it from here.

04:21.685 --> 04:25.050
And that's how Mother got an associate's degree and became a school teacher.

04:25.871 --> 04:37.830
So she and Dad had a dream that all kids would go to college, and all of us did, and graduated, and my father said that was his biggest accomplishment.

04:39.532 --> 04:42.916
Why did you end up at Texas A&M?

04:42.976 --> 04:43.978
How did that come about?

04:44.498 --> 04:53.530
Well, I was a marginal athlete, and all the Aggies in the region, they kept their eye out for boys.

04:53.930 --> 05:03.683
And starting your sophomore, junior year, you know, they'd talk to you, and they would get you a summer job.

05:04.270 --> 05:10.824
and there were some folks named Ellerby who were in the steel business down there and I hung steel for them.

05:11.966 --> 05:14.852
And there was a sheriff named C.H.

05:14.972 --> 05:24.372
Charlie Myers who was the sheriff of Jefferson County who had never graduated from A&M, but I think he had consumed a lot of beer at Uncle Ed's.

05:25.060 --> 05:33.750
And he was the local BMOC, big man on campus down there, and a guy named Gordon LaBoeuf and Jack Hawthorne.

05:33.991 --> 05:48.368
LaBoeuf was from Port Natchez, Hawthorne was from Niederland, Sammy Myers was from Beaumont, was a high jumper and a basketball player, and I were loaded up in a sheriff's car and taken to Houston, Texas to see A&M play Rice.

05:49.040 --> 05:54.790
And A&M came back and scored three times in the last few minutes and won.

05:54.870 --> 05:58.737
And we had a stake at the Confederate House.

05:58.757 --> 06:01.361
We were supposed to go to Yale College Inn, but it was too crowded.

06:01.762 --> 06:06.931
So we went to this other place called the Confederate House where a guy named Garden Edge had started a stake house.

06:07.872 --> 06:09.856
And, you know, I was sold.

06:09.896 --> 06:12.921
I'd never been on the A&M campus, didn't know anything about it.

06:12.901 --> 06:17.226
So they started me off in Junction, Texas.

06:17.726 --> 06:23.473
I was told to report out there because they looked at my academic transcript from Haskell.

06:24.374 --> 06:38.470
And you have to remember, Haskell, at that time, the catalog, if you view the catalog in 1956, the requirements were that you be a resident of the state, a Haskell graduate, and free of infectious and contagious diseases.

06:38.905 --> 06:40.887
And no felony convictions.

06:40.907 --> 06:42.249
And no felony convictions.

06:42.489 --> 06:45.973
And the coach said, look, two out of three isn't bad.

06:45.993 --> 06:48.035
You ought to let the boy in and give him a chance.

06:48.836 --> 07:00.289
So I go off to Junction, Texas, and made the acquaintance of Buddy Denton and D. Kutich, two men who had a hell of an impact on my life.

07:01.090 --> 07:05.335
For some reason, they saw something in me and took me under their wing.

07:06.158 --> 07:13.446
And I got, we had freshman English, freshman math, and a hell of a lot of physical education.

07:14.247 --> 07:28.782
Now, two years before, Coach Bryant had taken the team out there, the famous Junction boys, and then our class was the last class that they would let you take kids that were coming in and go up there and do that.

07:29.863 --> 07:33.347
But Kutesh and Denton, who were the athletic,

07:33.665 --> 07:39.658
I think they were called the Scholastic Coaches or something.

07:40.229 --> 07:45.695
That was my introduction, and they got me started on the right footpath.

07:45.715 --> 07:56.346
I said, the Ellerbees wanted me to be, and said, you know, the Corps is the greatest thing, so I said, you know, I didn't want to live in an athletic dorm, so I started off living in the Corps.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.909
Which outfit were you?

07:59.289 --> 08:01.672
It was an Air Force outfit, and they changed it every year.

08:01.692 --> 08:07.238
And the last year, there was Squadron 17, but I think that first year, it was Squadron 11.

08:07.578 --> 08:09.460
How did you get from...

08:09.440 --> 08:32.730
junction back to college station well back to college station uh you know i i had i'd been working every summer i went i started off i'd worked steel i'd worked tow boats i'd been in the merchant marine and i saved my money and i you know i owned a car uh okay uh i had a 48 plymouth with 21 coats a hand rub maroon lacquer and rolled and pleated leather interior and i

08:33.217 --> 08:40.128
three-quarter race Chrysler Hemi head and a Dodge truck transmission.

08:40.248 --> 08:42.912
And it was a bad motor scooter.

08:44.074 --> 08:51.606
But so I went up to Cottage Station, as we were talking about earlier.

08:52.768 --> 08:58.217
And, you know, I found out that if you were, you know, you got your clothes to wear.

08:58.597 --> 09:00.861
I had everything I owned in a ditty bag, you know.

09:01.415 --> 09:04.219
And you're old enough to know what a ditty bag is.

09:05.941 --> 09:08.825
And I got up there and got my uniforms and everything.

09:08.945 --> 09:17.637
And so you're supposed to go and get a room assignment in the athletic dorm.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.140
Well, I was going to live with Cory, you know, macho man.

09:20.701 --> 09:22.684
And, you know, it was a lot of fun, but I was late.

09:24.086 --> 09:26.629
And about the, you know,

09:26.609 --> 09:42.626
Oh, I think it was the second week I came dragging in there, and Smokey Harper, who was the trainer, and Smokey, who gave the world those memorable words, the only goddamn thing good at A&M's are trees, and they're cutting them down.

09:42.646 --> 09:50.794
And Smokey, his other great contribution was

09:51.044 --> 09:52.386
You're not hurt, boy, get up.

09:52.747 --> 09:56.032
And unless you had a compound fracture, you were going to hear that.

09:56.693 --> 09:59.737
He believed in the power of positive thinking and self-healing.

10:00.358 --> 10:05.186
And so he said, now, you need to come here.

10:05.246 --> 10:06.988
He said, I'm not going to let you go out there.

10:07.028 --> 10:10.393
And he said, I'm just going to show you that you were here today.

10:10.413 --> 10:12.156
And he said, you're not worth a damn.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.179
Nobody's going to know whether you were here or not anyway.

10:14.199 --> 10:15.381
He said, I'm going to tell you something.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.900
You go get your shit and you move over here to Hart Hall.

10:18.940 --> 10:28.241
He said, I've got a room in Hart Hall and that's where you're going to be because if you, you need to decide if you want to be a soldier boy or you want to try to be an athlete.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.765
That's how I got moved to Hart Hall.

10:30.967 --> 10:35.277
And so that spring I was running,

10:35.965 --> 10:40.762
Colonel Anderson was a track coach then.

10:40.802 --> 10:42.107
What event?

10:43.492 --> 10:47.747
Back then they tried you in everything and I ran a quarter mile and a half mile.

10:48.352 --> 10:50.154
Did a little bit of broad.

10:50.254 --> 10:54.359
I had jumped some and I asked you, boy, I was not anywhere near a college.

10:54.520 --> 10:59.085
Well, I wasn't near a college competitor in anything, but, you know, it was obvious.

10:59.606 --> 11:01.368
I couldn't get over the bar where they started.

11:01.849 --> 11:13.363
So I was out there and ripped a hamstring loose again, and so I hobbled around, and so they said, okay, you need to rehabilitate and you go to cross country.

11:13.343 --> 11:21.853
And that's when we ran the cross-country track, was around where all the housing was over there.

11:23.115 --> 11:34.508
And one of the houses you ran by was Chief Hickmans, who was chief of the KK, and his son was on the freshman track team.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.536
I'd gotten acquainted with a father.

11:37.917 --> 11:39.840
I didn't know it was Hickman's father at the time.

11:40.602 --> 11:43.226
I was, freshman couldn't have a car on campus.

11:43.246 --> 11:51.440
Well, I'd brought my car up there and I'd found a guy that first week when they said, you can't have a car on campus.

11:51.581 --> 11:52.903
One of the guys was a day duck.

11:53.524 --> 11:55.367
He said, look, you can park it over to our house.

11:55.768 --> 11:57.591
I said, we got a place out there in the backyard.

11:57.631 --> 11:59.314
You can pull it out and keep it over there.

11:59.294 --> 12:01.217
So I thought that was great.

12:01.237 --> 12:13.734
So I was going to go home, so I went over to his house with him, got my car, and I was coming back on campus to load my stuff in down at Hart Hall, and that's before they closed all the streets off.

12:14.415 --> 12:24.930
As I came by the YMCA, and that's the KKs were down there in the basement of the thing, a guy looking over his shoulder, talking to someone,

12:25.552 --> 12:28.095
turned and walked into the side of my car.

12:28.155 --> 12:28.875
I didn't hit him.

12:28.935 --> 12:34.461
He walked into the side of my car, and it was kind of like a pinball machine.

12:34.481 --> 12:38.345
He bounced in between that and the other car, and it broke his hip.

12:39.866 --> 12:46.473
And the theory was, you're a freshman driving on campus, and if you hadn't been there, this accident wouldn't have happened.

12:46.853 --> 12:51.778
So you learned to say, yes, sir.

12:52.467 --> 13:04.504
But my TAC officer down there, Colonel Melcher, he said, you know, you shouldn't throw the boy out of school because Hickman's the damn dummy.

13:04.524 --> 13:06.026
He walked into the side of his car.

13:07.228 --> 13:11.835
So they said, you know, don't even have the car in College Station.

13:11.895 --> 13:13.117
Take it home and leave it there.

13:13.657 --> 13:15.039
And they put me on probation.

13:16.021 --> 13:18.024
Now, that was the fall.

13:19.225 --> 13:22.390
In the spring, I went on academic probation.

13:23.095 --> 13:32.492
The next fall, I came back up, and I'd fallen under the influence of a bunch of baseball players.

13:32.533 --> 13:38.704
Wayne Sharper, who later was the principal of the high school down here, where my kids went to school.

13:39.566 --> 13:42.471
Donnie Hullum and Hogjaw Harrington.

13:42.974 --> 13:52.458
And anything John Hall says about me, I want to have equal time because he's a lying son of a bitch.

13:52.759 --> 13:54.704
And I want you to hear my side of the story.

13:55.306 --> 14:00.038
Well, that crazy bunch of guys used to pull all kinds of pranks.

14:00.457 --> 14:03.483
So we stormed a guy in the hall.

14:03.964 --> 14:07.951
You know, with an athletic card, it only cost you, I think, a dime to get in.

14:08.352 --> 14:09.454
But it wasn't a dime.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.017
It was Mr. Putty.

14:11.197 --> 14:13.482
It was Mr. Puttman.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.906
We called him Putty, who we all dearly loved.

14:16.227 --> 14:21.537
Later on, we sent him money when he was nine at the motion picture home up there.

14:21.517 --> 14:30.533
We'd send one guy in and he'd pull the nails on the window and you'd run that window and you could hear that Mr. Buddy and start running.

14:30.894 --> 14:33.920
Then there's how many of us could get in and scatter out through the thing.

14:34.541 --> 14:41.854
Then we would go watch the movies during the week and write all of our materials and routines so that on Saturday when

14:42.307 --> 14:45.291
The faculty and everyone came and Guyon Hall was full.

14:45.351 --> 14:48.655
Well, they had the movie, but we did our entertaining acts.

14:48.735 --> 15:04.093
In the middle of the movie, one of my favorites was when Hogjaw Harrington and Donnie Hullum, they had an Earl Flynn film, and they came across the stage with their helmet liners and wooden swords and garbage candle heads, sword fighting going across.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.715
Well, that, you know, brought the house down.

15:06.067 --> 15:31.450
putty got to chase them and they would run up on the gridiron up on the gridiron over it in hullum to make a he got trapped so he jumps on this rope not knowing that it counterbalanced the screen so as he comes down the screen goes up in here so that brought the house down but they could never recognize those guys so the night that we stormed guy and hall i came rolling around the corner

15:31.987 --> 15:37.775
and ran into Putty and Colonel Melcher and all three of us went down the middle of the lobby.

15:38.576 --> 15:48.229
So I went on probation for that and then my junior year I was on probation and they threw me out in the spring.

15:49.110 --> 15:49.350
H.L.

15:49.390 --> 15:58.703
Heaton said you have cut more classes than anyone we've ever had and while you have maintained a

15:59.273 --> 16:01.576
a one-point average, that was a 3-2-1 deal.

16:01.737 --> 16:06.684
He said, you're not serious about this and you're out of A&M.

16:07.826 --> 16:15.076
So I went to Lamar Tesh in Beaumont for my junior year and my mother was really upset with me.

16:16.278 --> 16:20.264
And she went to see Earl Rudder unbeknownst to me.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.509
And General Rudder called me back

16:24.080 --> 16:45.430
I got a telegram to be in his office at 0800 hours on such and such a date, and I showed up, and you have not had your ass chewed unless you have had some personal attention from Earl Rudder, who went through my file there, and he said, he said, Raines, I want to tell you, he said, this is not an academic file, this is a rap sheet.

16:45.764 --> 16:50.089
He said, I've never seen anyone who in a short period of time could compile this record.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.492
I said, no wonder HL threw you out of here.

16:52.572 --> 16:54.033
You deserve to be thrown out.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.877
And then he told me, and I told this story.

16:56.917 --> 17:04.285
They invited me back to be a commencement speaker a few years ago, and I told this story, and Margaret Rudder was up there, and she got the biggest kick out of it.

17:04.305 --> 17:07.088
Every time I see her, she reminds me of that.

17:07.169 --> 17:11.113
She told me later, she said, Earl came home and told me about this.

17:11.448 --> 17:29.688
He told me, he said, somewhere reigns in the United States Army is a master sergeant who is one year from retirement and he got drunk or something and did something and said they have busted him back to corporal and told him that he keeps his nose clean, they'll let him retire as a master sergeant.

17:30.189 --> 17:38.738
Said, now this is a man who has invested 20 something years in a career and he has seen it all hang by a thread.

17:39.578 --> 17:46.602
He said, now, if you mess with me and you look cross-eyed up here, I'm gonna see that you're thrown out.

17:46.919 --> 17:56.388
And I will further see that your draft board is aware of the fact that you have taken money from us in this ROTC program and abused your privileges up here.

17:57.128 --> 17:58.710
And I will see that you're drafted.

17:59.010 --> 18:03.134
And then I will locate that sergeant and further see that you're assigned to him.

18:03.154 --> 18:13.923
And I will personally call him and tell him that my name is General Earl Rudder and that his entire retirement depends upon making your miserable life more miserable.

18:14.324 --> 18:15.885
Do we understand each other?

18:15.905 --> 18:16.926
Yes, sir.

18:16.906 --> 18:24.320
Well, now, I left his office with a renewed dedication and focus on academic excellence.

18:25.082 --> 18:31.393
And my senior year, you can go pull my transcript, you will notice there is a marked difference.

18:32.375 --> 18:32.936
And H.L.

18:32.956 --> 18:39.589
Heaton, who approved my degree plan, advised me within four days of the drop in ad,

18:40.025 --> 18:46.312
that while I was going to have the necessary hours to graduate, I did not have the requisite courses.

18:46.332 --> 18:55.201
And I needed a management course, which unfortunately, the ad date had passed, and so I was not going to be able to graduate.

18:56.142 --> 19:03.650
But I got in touch with the University of Texas that had a correspondence course, drove to Austin, talked to the professor, told him my situation.

19:04.191 --> 19:06.994
He said, if you will turn in three lessons a week

19:07.497 --> 19:11.163
each week and take this final, I will get it down to H.L.

19:11.203 --> 19:13.006
Heaton.

19:13.026 --> 19:19.556
Now, I'm carrying 21 hours my senior year, and I didn't load on a three-hour correspondence course under that.

19:20.337 --> 19:23.262
Long story short, I made it, took the final,

19:24.170 --> 19:30.419
And I told him the situation, and I said, I'm not sure Mr. Heaton's going to accept it.

19:31.762 --> 19:34.345
And he said, well, we're going to East Texas to Tyler.

19:34.406 --> 19:37.690
I'll drive through College Station and deliver it myself.

19:39.113 --> 19:42.277
And he brought it down and got a receipt from H.L.

19:42.338 --> 19:45.502
Heaton for that course, which he mailed to me.

19:46.304 --> 19:50.390
And I have somewhere in the bowels of all my papers a letter from H.L.

19:50.450 --> 19:50.690
Heaton.

19:50.730 --> 19:52.573
And you know the normal letter that you get?

19:53.431 --> 19:54.834
I didn't get the normal letter.

19:55.115 --> 20:13.195
I got a letter that said, Mr. Raines, after reviewing the catalog at the time of your matriculation and the statutes of the law of the state of Texas and the policies of this university and reviewing your academic record, I can find no reason to deny you the degree.

20:14.153 --> 20:17.457
And I can't blame HL Eaton a bit.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.740
You know, he had every reason to feel that way about me.

20:20.661 --> 20:35.140
So I graduated, and I told him at commencement, I said, now all you parents that are here with all these guys that were worried about whether or not you were going to get certified, I want you to know I am the patron saint of anyone that's ever carried the anchor out of here.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.624
And there is hope for you.

20:38.084 --> 20:40.988
We had a whole cheering section there.

20:41.643 --> 20:45.671
Let's go back though and go through kind of chronologically.

20:46.172 --> 20:52.524
When you got to A&M that first fall, how did you get assigned to a unit?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.328
Where did, how did you know where to go?

20:54.368 --> 20:56.652
Hal Haskell, you went through registration.

20:56.772 --> 20:57.153
I don't know.

20:57.173 --> 21:00.259
They just, I guess they, you know.

21:00.712 --> 21:01.954
You got thrown in a pot.

21:02.034 --> 21:03.537
I don't have any clear recollection.

21:03.557 --> 21:05.381
Do you remember why it was Air Force instead of Army?

21:05.561 --> 21:11.412
Oh, they ask you if you want to be Air Force or Army, and I had enough sense to know I didn't want to carry an M1 out there.

21:12.113 --> 21:16.301
I wanted to fly, and I went into and qualified for the flight program.

21:16.341 --> 21:17.182
That was my dream.

21:17.583 --> 21:22.973
Right, and then you get in Hart Hall where the athletes were, the non-football.

21:23.223 --> 21:26.888
Well, yeah, the spring sports.

21:26.908 --> 21:28.811
And who was your roommate that freshman year?

21:28.851 --> 21:33.597
Well, he was a guy from Port Arthur who was up there who was a runner.

21:34.318 --> 21:35.700
Did you all go through corps?

21:36.481 --> 21:37.142
Oh, yeah.

21:37.282 --> 21:44.192
We, you know, every now and then we'd march and people would shout, give them a rope, it's a lynch mob, you know.

21:44.212 --> 21:48.438
And look, there were two of them actually in step with each other and said, that's an accident.

21:48.758 --> 21:49.779
They gave us a hard time.

21:49.799 --> 21:51.482
We were not the most military outfit.

21:51.502 --> 21:52.403
Where did you all eat?

21:52.957 --> 21:53.718
Duncan.

21:53.919 --> 21:54.339
In Duncan?

21:54.520 --> 21:56.183
We had training tables in Duncan.

21:56.984 --> 21:58.767
Did you fall out and march to Duncan?

21:59.428 --> 22:06.400
No, it was more like everyone just ambled over and kind of got there, because generally you're coming from practice.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.063
What was the routine at your table?

22:10.047 --> 22:16.478
Well, now, when I was in the Corps, it was a different routine, and I sat on the hot corner, which I thought, I loved all that BS.

22:16.498 --> 22:17.800
I thought it was a lot of fun.

22:18.185 --> 22:20.991
And man, we were organized to freshmen.

22:21.011 --> 22:22.554
We were drowning people out.

22:22.574 --> 22:27.665
I mean, the core was made for me because, you know, they had some guy chew on you.

22:27.725 --> 22:31.273
You'd sit there and they'd, you know, say, you're skylarking, mister.

22:31.453 --> 22:33.257
Give me 20, and, you know, you'd rip.

22:33.946 --> 22:35.147
You know, it was like a big game.

22:36.068 --> 22:40.072
What are some of the pranks that you remember that you guys were involved in?

22:40.092 --> 22:44.335
Oh, God, we stayed in things all the time, right up to my senior year.

22:44.896 --> 22:58.788
Percy Mims, you know, who is a friend, but, you know, our junior year, and I wound up going back to the core once they determined that I had absolutely no athletic ability.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.953
When I came, I went to the core and, uh,

23:03.933 --> 23:10.362
I guess my sophomore, the spring semester of my sophomore year, I couldn't run anymore.

23:11.303 --> 23:14.628
And so I got assigned back to an outfit over there.

23:15.710 --> 23:26.785
And there was a guy named Mirsky, who was a ground pounder, and Sammy Myers, who had been, you know,

23:27.136 --> 23:39.373
a basketball player, and he wasn't playing basketball anymore, and who was from Belmont, and I and the three of us ran around together, and we got just about anything you could get into.

23:41.356 --> 23:44.179
What are some of the most original pranks y'all played?

23:44.199 --> 23:49.026
Well, we had a Coke machine that we kept reporting that they wouldn't

23:49.478 --> 23:50.399
And they wouldn't fix it.

23:50.900 --> 23:57.047
So we took it up on top of the dorm and threw it into the quadrangle and got the coke machine replaced.

23:58.389 --> 24:01.473
Kind of destructive but it seemed like an excellent idea at the time.

24:01.513 --> 24:12.146
They had gone out and I think the band had complained because somebody had driven a car across the band's drill.

24:12.206 --> 24:18.574
So they put in this fence out there that was pipe that was about this high.

24:19.583 --> 24:26.229
And we were walking back one night from Eastgate.

24:26.750 --> 24:42.764
There was a place that served beverages over there, and it was rather dark, and we hit that pipe, all of us, and we were, you know, grab ass running around and hit that pipe and, I mean, just knocked the crap out of all of us.

24:42.805 --> 24:43.665
We were on a dead run.

24:44.626 --> 24:46.748
So we moaned and laid around.

24:46.808 --> 24:48.730
Fortunately, nothing was broken.

24:49.385 --> 25:00.660
and it hadn't been in the ground too long, so we managed to get up about 70 feet, pull the concrete and the pipe out of the ground, which,

25:01.383 --> 25:06.389
Then we got down to some point where they poured it the day before and we couldn't get it up.

25:06.409 --> 25:15.820
So we took the end that we did have up and walked it in a circle around the tree because, you know, we had studied physics and wrapped that thing around the tree.

25:15.840 --> 25:24.610
So the next morning it came out and here was their pipe wrapped around the tree, but we had moved it up to height so you could see it and it wouldn't trip anyone anymore.

25:25.231 --> 25:26.092
No one got caught?

25:26.553 --> 25:27.694
Well, of course not.

25:29.412 --> 25:36.120
And, I mean, we got caught for doing enough things without all the things we didn't get.

25:36.140 --> 25:37.882
Did y'all find your way into steam tunnels?

25:38.563 --> 25:39.604
Oh, the steam tunnels.

25:39.664 --> 25:48.594
Let me tell you, when you lived in Hart Hall, the first sign that you were getting near finals is Watson, Don Watson, you know, played football up there.

25:49.175 --> 25:52.199
You would see Watson in the steam tunnels, you know.

25:52.219 --> 25:55.903
You knew he was getting near finals because he was over stealing quits.

25:55.923 --> 25:57.765
That guy named Snake McKeown.

25:57.745 --> 26:02.834
They claimed he was on a golf scholarship.

26:03.135 --> 26:06.521
He didn't know a caddy from a polo pony.

26:07.182 --> 26:11.350
But, uh, Snake was the best second story man in the universe.

26:11.470 --> 26:15.838
And, uh, you know, my fondest memory is one night when he was a kid.

26:15.818 --> 26:19.042
I'm walking past the academic building.

26:19.062 --> 26:19.543
I hear, rains.

26:20.544 --> 26:22.006
I look around, rains.

26:22.066 --> 26:26.152
And I look up and Snake is on the side of the academic building.

26:26.653 --> 26:29.176
And he's got to get up here and get this window open.

26:29.196 --> 26:31.459
I said, where in the hell are you?

26:31.559 --> 26:33.282
He said, somebody's locked the goddamn window.

26:33.302 --> 26:34.283
I can't get back in.

26:34.651 --> 26:36.133
And he was at the stairwell.

26:36.193 --> 26:43.381
He had evidently gone out on the ledge at the stairwell, had gone around to some prof's office to get in.

26:43.842 --> 26:45.964
And he gets back, and they have locked him in.

26:46.104 --> 26:54.394
So I'm in the academic building, you know, at midnight, trying to get a window unlocked to rescue Snake on the ledge up there.

26:54.654 --> 26:55.855
Never asked him what he's doing.

26:55.935 --> 26:59.279
Didn't want to be involved, but Snake was a colorful.

26:59.299 --> 27:01.722
We had a lot of colorful people up there then.

27:02.208 --> 27:04.532
You weren't at A&M any family?

27:04.552 --> 27:05.413
I got there in 59.

27:05.754 --> 27:09.880
Okay, well, Coach Bryant had some rather unique people.

27:12.725 --> 27:28.030
Ken Beck, the mayor of Northgate, he was a player from Louisiana, and Tracy and Andy Hillhouse, he wasn't, he didn't make all conferences in the end, but he was a Southwest Conference street fighting champion.

27:29.056 --> 27:43.494
Then we had a guy that was my suite mate who became a veterinarian and he had been a seal, a Navy seal in Korea and he threw the shot put and the discus.

27:44.655 --> 27:52.785
And he was a big boy with a lot of skills and everyone on the campus

27:54.065 --> 27:59.887
Charlie Krueger one day at practice, he threw the discus and it bounced out there and hit Krueger in the leg.

28:00.771 --> 28:03.923
And he picked that thing up and he said, God damn it, who threw this?

28:05.641 --> 28:08.425
And what was that old boy's name?

28:08.465 --> 28:09.145
I'm getting old.

28:09.466 --> 28:10.607
He turned around and said, I did.

28:10.988 --> 28:15.634
He said, well, I just wanted to let you know you could have hit some of us.

28:15.674 --> 28:20.200
You know, I mean, everybody thought, boy, this is going to be the fight of the century.

28:20.460 --> 28:27.910
Of all of those Starr Bryant football players, which ones did you all respect the most?

28:27.930 --> 28:28.290
Well...

28:29.468 --> 28:37.179
I mean, the only one I disrespected, I caught him twice stealing stuff, was Murray Trimble, the one-armed bandit.

28:37.940 --> 28:39.362
Murray's just kleptomaniac.

28:41.185 --> 28:42.847
You know, he just had a problem, you know.

28:44.550 --> 28:48.355
But, like, Drake Keith was a good... Bobby Drake Keith.

28:48.375 --> 28:55.105
See, my sister married an Aggie, and he was my...

28:56.705 --> 29:02.334
They all went to Church of Christ and Biebs Stallings and Bobby Drake and all that bunch.

29:02.354 --> 29:09.646
So the first week I'm there, Biebs and Bobby Drake come over to see me.

29:11.028 --> 29:13.612
And I'm living in the Corps and they said, you know, we just want to see.

29:13.633 --> 29:21.345
You know, well, everybody in the outfit was really impressed because here's two big studs, you know, there's seniors on the football team.

29:22.523 --> 29:24.906
And, you know, Beeb said, what are you doing living here?

29:25.567 --> 29:27.810
He said, you can't make it back.

29:27.830 --> 29:32.096
You know, he gave me the first lecture, and I'm sure he'd probably talk to Smokey, but anyway.

29:33.098 --> 29:36.683
So, you know, I just thought the sun rose and sat in those guys.

29:37.204 --> 29:41.289
And you have never had licks unless you've had John David Grove give you swats with a broom.

29:41.469 --> 29:43.312
I mean, he can pick you up off the ground.

29:43.853 --> 29:45.215
But, I mean, it's all in good fun.

29:45.255 --> 29:45.896
There was nobody.

29:45.936 --> 29:49.020
Like I say, the only guy that was kind of weird and

29:49.625 --> 29:54.534
and was mean and, you know, would steal or just the kind of guy that wasn't terribly admirable.

29:54.614 --> 29:58.781
And don't put this in because I don't even know if he's lying now, but he was.

29:58.801 --> 30:05.473
Now, I've heard that Coach Claiborne was the person that would go talk to

30:05.926 --> 30:11.913
instructors about athletics, athletes' grades, Jerry Claiborne.

30:12.454 --> 30:13.996
Did you have any interaction?

30:14.076 --> 30:15.798
I was not far, you know.

30:15.818 --> 30:18.441
Man, they didn't, they wouldn't have cared whether I flunked out or not, you know.

30:18.461 --> 30:20.644
I mean, if you were a real athlete, I'm sure you did.

30:20.764 --> 30:24.889
I, you know, Buddy Denton and Dee Kutesh, I saw them, and they.

30:25.450 --> 30:28.433
Why did you have such high regard for those two?

30:28.453 --> 30:28.934
What did they do?

30:28.954 --> 30:34.701
Well, they took an interest in me, you know, and they gave you some advice, they mentored you, and my dad,

30:35.018 --> 30:37.600
My dad was not the kind of guy that ever did any of that.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.961
He'd not been an athlete.

30:39.001 --> 30:40.222
He'd never been around any of that.

30:41.704 --> 30:43.085
It was all kind of foreign to him.

30:43.105 --> 30:45.067
Dad didn't hunt, didn't fish, you know.

30:45.767 --> 30:47.088
He worked all the time, was gone.

30:47.509 --> 30:51.632
So they were, the male relationships that I had.

30:52.073 --> 30:56.076
Bub Phillips, I got to know Bub when I was in high school, and he coached at another high school over there.

30:56.356 --> 31:00.460
But he was the kind of guy, most coaches, you know, just, they like kids.

31:00.560 --> 31:04.283
Kids like them, and you form an attachment, so it was natural for me

31:04.735 --> 31:06.637
to form an attachment with them.

31:06.797 --> 31:08.820
And we had all kinds of things.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.802
And I excelled out there at Junction, you know.

31:11.002 --> 31:14.105
There's lots of different levels of competition than what we were doing.

31:15.147 --> 31:17.169
When I could stay healthy, I could do pretty well.

31:17.189 --> 31:19.071
But, you know, I was light.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.634
And, you know, football, you went both ways then.

31:21.674 --> 31:27.300
And, you know, I was constantly getting my ass drug off because somebody had run over me.
