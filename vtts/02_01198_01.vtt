WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:16.989
Okay,

00:02.950 --> 00:16.989
my name is Roger Galatis and I'm president of the 
Woodlands Corporation. I've been with the

00:17.770 --> 00:31.388
Woodlands Corporation now since February of 1979 
and had an opportunity to participate in the

00:17.770 --> 00:31.388
growth of the Woodlands during that period of time 
and also Prior to 1979, I lived in a local area,

00:32.026 --> 00:58.270
worked for a competing real estate development 
company whose name is Friendswood Development

00:32.026 --> 00:58.270
Company, a subsidiary of Exxon, and had an 
opportunity to watch the Woodlands grow from its

00:32.026 --> 00:58.270
beginning and monitored and participated in that 
growth through its 16-year history to this point.

00:58.553 --> 01:02.038
The Woodlands is 16 years old October 19th. 
Everything you see here today and what you will

01:03.601 --> 01:12.174
encounter has occurred in 16 years.

01:12.194 --> 01:12.574
Remarkable. Now, in Friendswood, in terms of what 
Friendswood was doing as compared to what the

01:13.115 --> 01:25.354
Woodlands... Well, Friendswood and all the 
company is wholly owned subsidiary of the Exxon

01:13.115 --> 01:25.354
Corporation. And they have developed 
large-scale communities in Houston, Clear Lake

01:25.925 --> 01:34.074
City, which is where the NASA Space Center is 
located. And actually, it was the first

01:34.635 --> 01:39.680
large-scale plane community to be developed in 
the Houston region. That started in the late 50s,

01:39.700 --> 01:45.587
actually, and active development work in the 
early and mid-60s. The second large community

01:47.109 --> 01:53.296
that Princewood developed was a joint venture 
with King Ranch. And it's called Kingwood, which

01:53.316 --> 01:55.358
is located 25 miles to the east of the woodlands. 
Both of those very large scale, similar in nature

01:59.770 --> 02:10.424
to the woodlands in terms of scope and size and life 
expectancy and those kind of things. So I had some

02:10.444 --> 02:24.923
reference to judge what was happening in the 
woodlands in the early days and make the move to the

02:10.444 --> 02:24.923
woodlands when I first came in contact with George 
Mitchell. Well,

02:25.207 --> 02:39.843
I was happily working for Friendswood, and I got a 
call one day from an executive search firm, and the

02:25.207 --> 02:39.843
question was, would you like to join the Woodlands 
development? And my first answer was, no, I'm

02:39.863 --> 02:43.888
happy where I am. Well, that conversation went on 
for a while, and the short story is that after

02:43.908 --> 02:51.096
several conversations, I elected to to join the 
Woodlands, and that was in 1979, and I've been here

02:51.633 --> 02:56.038
continuously since that time. Had you contacted 
George Mitchell, had conversations with him

02:56.218 --> 03:01.745
before that decision, personally? I knew George 
Mitchell by reputation, but not personally, and I

03:02.185 --> 03:19.986
knew the Woodlands by observation, and I knew a 
number of the people who lived and worked in the

03:02.185 --> 03:19.986
Woodlands, so I had some knowledge of what was 
happening, but no personal knowledge of Mr.

03:02.185 --> 03:19.986
Mitchell and his a visionary approach and 
enthusiasm for doing things in a visionary way. So

03:28.078 --> 03:30.262
that's not what brought you into this firm? No, it 
was not that per se. I guess one of the things that

03:33.507 --> 03:48.370
was intriguing about coming to the Woodlands was 
the fact that it was in Montgomery County, a county

03:33.507 --> 03:48.370
where I established home, a place I wanted to 
remain probably for the rest of my life. It was at

03:49.058 --> 03:57.828
the stage of development where a lot of potential 
existed for the future, and I thought the timing

03:49.058 --> 03:57.828
was good to make that move. Did you move in as 
President? Yeah, President. No. Originally I

04:01.773 --> 04:17.091
came to the Woodlands and was responsible for the 
residential part of the development here, the

04:01.773 --> 04:17.091
residential community, which includes all the 
infrastructure and support structures, support

04:01.773 --> 04:17.091
structure for the residents who lived here, 
including schools and churches and that kind of

04:17.712 --> 04:25.664
infrastructure. I originally came as Senior Vice 
President of Residential Development, later

04:25.684 --> 04:39.105
became Executive Vice President of the company, 
and in 1986 became President of the

04:25.684 --> 04:39.105
company. You know George Mitchell now. Very well. 
You must have a feel for what it is he wanted you to

04:46.552 --> 04:53.439
do. As you got promoted through the company, you 
must have a sense of, I don't want to call it an

04:53.860 --> 05:07.995
agenda, but he obviously had certain things that 
he had you in mind to do. Well, George is a person who

05:08.896 --> 05:15.343
has a great vision for the future. And sometimes it 
takes lesser men a longer period of time to

05:15.813 --> 05:26.007
understand what that vision is. But George's 
enthusiasm never wanes. George never loses a

05:29.993 --> 05:33.298
battle. Maybe he's not yet won it, but he's not – 
he's never lost it.

05:44.281 --> 05:50.730
I mean, I think that's a very good point. I mean, I 
think that's a very good point. I mean, I think

05:57.620 --> 06:06.213
that's a very good point. I mean, I think that's a 
very good point. today are already solved. They

06:15.769 --> 06:19.194
may not like the solution, but nonetheless, 
they're solved. And he's thinking about 30 years

06:19.214 --> 06:22.638
down the road. And that describes Georgia about as 
well as any attempt to describe Georgia I've

06:22.659 --> 06:28.667
heard. And it's impressed me since I've heard 
Frank make that statement.

06:35.617 --> 06:41.305
I made a talk one time, and I said working for George 
Mitchell is fairly simple. what you need to do is do

06:42.635 --> 07:05.858
it with integrity do it with quality make sure you 
save the trees and natural vegetation and do it

06:42.635 --> 07:05.858
right now if you do those things you're in pretty 
good shape with george i think that's a consistent

06:42.635 --> 07:05.858
formula i would guess you george is not 
inconsistent george is very consistent in his

06:42.635 --> 07:05.858
approach and he's uh One of the things George does 
and insists that this company do, and I think it's a

07:07.154 --> 07:19.128
tribute to him and it's comfortable for us, is we 
put a lot back into this community. We expect to

07:20.490 --> 07:21.691
make a profit. We're in the business to make a 
profit. But there are many things that we do as a

07:24.535 --> 07:35.828
development company that puts value back into the 
community that has long-lasting effects and will

07:24.535 --> 07:35.828
have long-lasting effects on this community for 
years and years to come. but maybe a typical

07:36.365 --> 07:39.307
developer in other places might not do. For 
example, there's a program of art in public

07:40.108 --> 07:53.499
places, and as you drive through the community, 
you will see major works of art that's been

07:40.108 --> 07:53.499
installed in public esplanades or in your 
building. I think we have about 13 pieces of major

07:54.080 --> 08:04.649
artwork now that have been funded both by the 
development company and by other companies who

07:54.080 --> 08:04.649
bought land from us and built buildings. We set 
aside a portion of our land sales revenue, and a

08:06.622 --> 08:14.069
portion of the cost of constructing the building 
into an art fund. And that fund is used to not only

08:14.089 --> 08:21.197
acquire art pieces, but also to maintain those 
that have been acquired over time. We also just

08:22.678 --> 08:35.751
finished building and developing the Cynthia 
Wood Mitchell Center for Performing Arts in the

08:22.678 --> 08:35.751
Woodland, which is about a $10 million 
contribution that obviously is going to add value

08:22.678 --> 08:35.751
to the community. add value to the remaining lands 
we have to develop and sell. But it's something

08:41.025 --> 08:44.771
that didn't have to be done. It's something George 
wanted to do. He felt very strongly that it needed

08:46.173 --> 08:55.608
to be a regional asset for the city of Houston as 
well as the woodlands in Montgomery County. And

08:55.628 --> 09:04.422
this past year we had probably, in its first year of 
operations, 30 different performances there

08:55.628 --> 09:04.422
that included the ballet, the symphony, 
contemporary music, country music, a whole array

09:04.958 --> 09:11.207
of programs. And more than 200,000 people came to 
attend those 20 to 30 performances, an average of

09:11.227 --> 09:21.523
6,000 people for each performance. What was your 
vision for the Woodlands when you joined this

09:23.265 --> 09:29.194
company? Did you see it as something really 
different from what you'd been doing? Well, the

09:33.713 --> 09:43.648
Woodlands is probably more comprehensive than 
most other large-scale communities in the

09:33.713 --> 09:43.648
Houston region and is as comprehensive as any in 
the country. There are only five, six, maybe 10

09:43.668 --> 09:54.964
places in the country where a community like this 
is being developed in a comprehensive nature. So

09:55.645 --> 10:00.312
it's a unique employment

09:55.645 --> 10:00.312
opportunity. It gives you national exposure. 
international recognition not not just as an

10:02.975 --> 10:28.122
individual but the community and the quality of 
what's being done here is recognized as being

10:02.975 --> 10:28.122
quality one thing i see during here in the 
traditional new community concept is in fact this

10:02.975 --> 10:28.122
idea of the economic community yeah and i sense 
that maybe this is one of your special for us well

10:02.975 --> 10:28.122
explain how that's being developed early on we we 
We recognized clearly we were not just in the real

10:28.355 --> 10:42.357
estate development business, but we had to be in 
the economic development business if we were to

10:28.355 --> 10:42.357
succeed,

10:28.355 --> 10:42.357
which is different from some other large-scale 
communities. We started out, in fact, with a large

10:42.378 --> 10:48.928
residential component, a recreational 
component. But simultaneously with that, we set

10:52.925 --> 10:56.348
about the mission of developing jobs in the local 
community. When did that come along? Was that

10:57.589 --> 10:59.912
already part of the program when you came in? Yeah, 
it was in the fledgling stage. We've expanded it

11:02.854 --> 11:05.677
over the 12 years I've been here. But that was part 
of the mission. Our goal and objective is to create

11:10.442 --> 11:16.868
jobs along with housing and residential 
population. Right now we have close to 8,000

11:16.888 --> 11:20.431
permanent jobs in the woodland. The original 
objective was to have one job for every household

11:22.692 --> 11:25.877
in the Woodlands. Today we have about 11,500 
households and 8,000 jobs. But we also have about

11:31.426 --> 11:34.691
2,000 retirement units in the Woodlands. So if you 
take those out of the workforce, we're pretty

11:34.711 --> 11:39.358
close to imbalance. And I think the very 
impressive thing about that is we've been able to

11:40.200 --> 11:50.556
create those jobs during a period of time when 
Houston lost 200,000 jobs in its economy. Let's

11:50.772 --> 11:52.294
talk about the 1980s now. OK, the 1980s. 1979, 
you're here, and the economy is just about to go

11:53.795 --> 12:00.943
into a spin, I guess. Starting in 1980, late in 79, 
through 1982, the Houston economy, the Texas

12:00.963 --> 12:10.352
economy was very robust.

12:13.015 --> 12:20.543
Frankly, I guess we went through a period of 
arrogance in Texas and developed a reputation

12:13.015 --> 12:20.543
which was deserved, but not very pleasing in other 
parts of the country. The price of oil was

12:24.435 --> 12:27.638
escalating and energy was king. Jobs were being 
created in the Houston economy at the rate of

12:29.920 --> 12:36.105
65,000, 70,000 jobs a year. The population was 
growing at 90,000 a year. Tremendous need for

12:40.709 --> 12:46.234
housing, tremendous need for office buildings, 
tremendous need for shopping and support

12:40.709 --> 12:46.234
services. And frankly, a lot of things could be 
built in the without much thought given to

12:49.784 --> 12:53.828
quality, quality of life, and those kinds of 
things. And then in 1982, when the first decline in

12:54.849 --> 13:07.643
oil prices became apparent,

12:54.849 --> 13:07.643
some of that robust nature of the economy started 
drifting away. And by 1986, things were really

13:08.744 --> 13:14.290
pretty bad in the Houston economy as well as 
throughout the state of Texas. And it became quite

13:15.282 --> 13:38.978
apparent that if we were going to compete on a 
national scale and attract businesses into the

13:15.282 --> 13:38.978
Houston region and diversify our economy and get 
away from being 80% dependent on energy and try to

13:15.282 --> 13:38.978
bring in companies like Compaq Computer and 
biotechnology firms and things that would give us

13:15.282 --> 13:38.978
a broader economic base, We were going to have to 
pay attention as a city, as a region. We were going

13:42.802 --> 13:46.046
to have to pay attention to the quality of life 
issues. And that really played into the hands of

13:46.067 --> 13:53.898
the Woodlands very nicely because from the 
outset, our mission was to deal with quality of

13:46.067 --> 13:53.898
life. And back in 1982, we sold in the Woodlands, if 
I recall, as one measure of activity, I think we

13:53.918 --> 14:04.174
sold 1,000 new homes that year. But we only had... 
2.8% of the housing market in Houston. In the

14:12.056 --> 14:25.576
downturn in 1987-88, which was about the bottom of 
it, we were selling maybe 500 homes in Houston, but

14:12.056 --> 14:25.576
we had captured maybe 10% or 11% of the total 
market. So while absolute numbers had declined,

14:25.976 --> 14:30.883
our market share had grown tremendously. And 
today, the five large-scale communities in

14:31.604 --> 14:35.610
Houston capture about 40% of the housing market in 
Houston, which says that in five locations,

14:36.248 --> 14:47.679
almost one out of every two new home sales made in 
Houston are in those five locations. And those

14:47.699 --> 14:56.027
five locations, while they differ in scope and 
size and somewhat in approach, they do address

14:47.699 --> 14:56.027
quality of life issues. And I think the lack of 
zoning in Houston and the ability of these

14:56.468 --> 15:03.775
large-scale communities through restrictive 
covenants in effect establish a zoning so that

15:04.531 --> 15:34.048
people would know where the shopping centers are 
going to be and the apartments are going to be and

15:04.531 --> 15:34.048
the single-family housing are going to be, 
coupled with the mission of creating jobs in the

15:04.531 --> 15:34.048
local community and enhancing the mobility to get 
from this location to other job locations for

15:04.531 --> 15:34.048
those who did not work here, greatly enhanced the 
position of the woodlands and the other

15:04.531 --> 15:34.048
large-scale communities in the Houston region. 
Let me interrupt for a second and ask a question.

15:38.962 --> 15:55.546
You mentioned that in the downturn, and I don't 
want to put words in your mouth, but what I'm

15:38.962 --> 15:55.546
hearing you say is that the Woodlands was 
appropriately positioned to take advantage of

15:38.962 --> 15:55.546
quality of life issues. The quality of life issue 
has been something from the inception. That's

15:58.711 --> 15:59.131
right. We've heard. Did you, at the same time, 
though, I mean, was this a passive thing? Did you

16:03.598 --> 16:04.339
just reap a benefit? Or in fact, was there some sort 
of marketing effort, aggressive or low key, to go

16:05.436 --> 16:16.389
out and sell the concept of the Woodlands to other 
parts of the country? No. We aggressively

16:16.869 --> 16:20.693
marketed the product that we were building. And we 
were able to more clearly focus on the quality of

16:20.713 --> 16:28.062
life issues in that marketing approach. And we did 
things beyond marketing. Marketing is sort of an

16:31.466 --> 16:34.309
all-encompassing word. It includes selling, it 
includes advertising, but it also includes

16:34.745 --> 16:39.470
building a product. And I think we were building a 
product was the main thing. For example, we have

16:42.313 --> 16:59.431
planted the seed that led toward the development 
of a hospital in the Woodlands, which provided a

16:42.313 --> 16:59.431
delivery for health services in this local 
community and in this region surrounding the

16:42.313 --> 16:59.431
Woodlands. We also followed that same model and 
have have assisted in the development of a private

17:03.635 --> 17:08.520
college preparatory school here in the 
Woodlands. It's called the John Cooper School. We

17:11.022 --> 17:12.644
donated land. We guaranteed some of the financing 
for the first building to be constructed. We

17:16.868 --> 17:25.796
helped recruit the faculty and helped identify 
key board members to serve on a nonprofit

17:16.868 --> 17:25.796
corporation that owns it. Now, that does a couple 
of things for you. One, it expresses clearly your

17:32.558 --> 17:39.045
involvement in quality of life issues, and you're 
concerned for education, elevation of the

17:32.558 --> 17:39.045
educational standards. But in addition to that, 
it helps you to attract businesses here,

17:39.546 --> 18:00.388
particularly in the high-tech area, in the 
biotechnology and the medical field, which we

17:39.546 --> 18:00.388
actively pursued through the involvement of the 
Texas Medical Center, because those people are

17:39.546 --> 18:00.388
interested in quality education for their 
children, and they're more likely to live in an

17:39.546 --> 18:00.388
environment where that educational opportunity 
is available, where quality housing is

18:00.841 --> 18:11.393
available, a broad cross-section of housing 
opportunities are here, and medical services are

18:00.841 --> 18:11.393
available. So it's... But you have gotten 
cooperation and support from the Texas Medical

18:12.935 --> 18:29.093
Center, not competition in terms of... Well, 
Texas Medical... Institutions in the Texas

18:12.935 --> 18:29.093
Medical Center are separate and apart from the 
Texas Medical Center, which is a non-profit

18:12.935 --> 18:29.093
corporation itself. We've dealt with Baylor 
College of Medicine, University of Texas Health

18:29.393 --> 18:39.510
Science Center, now MD Anderson, and all of those 
have a presence here in the Woodlands. And an

18:39.530 --> 18:56.177
interesting thing that happened in this 
diversification effort in Texas and in the

18:39.530 --> 18:56.177
Houston region, before the downturn occurred, 
the Texas Medical Center engaged in tremendous

18:39.530 --> 18:56.177
research programs. They wrote about those 
research programs, published it in the England

18:57.372 --> 19:23.286
Journal of Medicine and other companies, 
pharmaceutical companies in other parts of the

18:57.372 --> 19:23.286
country and overseas,

18:57.372 --> 19:23.286
Europe and Japan particularly,

18:57.372 --> 19:23.286
took those academic findings and converted that 
to a product or a process that created commercial

18:57.372 --> 19:23.286
growth. And George Mitchell had the notion that 
You know, that could happen right here in Houston,

19:25.486 --> 19:31.513
Texas, and more particularly here in the 
Woodlands. And he formed a venture capital

19:31.533 --> 19:43.888
company to help medical schools fund startup 
companies so that they could develop and benefit

19:31.533 --> 19:43.888
from their academic work in a commercial field. 
And that benefited the Woodlands because we could

19:43.908 --> 19:47.852
build buildings to house that activity. The 
scientists would live here in the Woodlands and

19:48.713 --> 19:52.658
they would buy homes here. So it was, I think, a very 
good marriage that once again came out of the

19:53.465 --> 20:04.820
provision of George Mitchell and his willingness 
to invest funds to make it happen. Did this

20:04.840 --> 20:07.584
basically start with a hospital and then started 
to expand? No, the hospital came along. The

20:09.747 --> 20:17.958
hospital actually was a separate initiative, not 
directly tied to the medical research in the

20:09.747 --> 20:17.958
medical center. It was tied to the clinical 
aspects of the medical center. And it was needed

20:23.435 --> 20:27.659
actually to help deliver it. In the early days, 
1975, 76, 77, a group of people in the Woodlands

20:28.840 --> 20:35.226
came together. And this is what's nice about the 
Woodlands. The developer doesn't have to do

20:38.169 --> 20:39.970
everything here. It's the quality of people who 
come in and make this a very special place. Given

20:44.795 --> 20:50.440
the chance, they'll solve a lot of their own 
problems and give them some initiative and

20:44.795 --> 20:50.440
encouragement. But a group of people came 
together something called the Woodlands Medical

20:52.882 --> 21:03.397
Center, Inc. And they just, they had this 
question, how do we provide medical services for a

20:52.882 --> 21:03.397
growing community that one day will be 150,000 
people? And it started out with a vision of having a

21:04.319 --> 21:12.330
clinic with two beds in it and so that you could have 
outpatient services. And that notion grew into a

21:13.352 --> 21:17.117
100 bed hospital before it was constructed. But 
this was outside the framework of the Woodlands

21:17.384 --> 21:20.708
Corporation. Well, we were deeply involved in it. 
We were involved in it. I spent eight years of my

21:23.872 --> 21:25.494
life working on it. But that was the facility. We 
had a nonprofit corporation with a board of

21:29.939 --> 21:43.155
directors comprised of people who lived in this 
community and also some people who were

21:29.939 --> 21:43.155
associated with Baylor College of Medicine and 
Methodist Hospital. through that nucleus of

21:43.777 --> 21:53.869
people and some funding on our behalf and some 
planning that we put into it, we now have a hundred

21:43.777 --> 21:53.869
bed hospital operating here. It's a non-profit 
corporation. And that same model was used to

21:56.132 --> 22:00.117
develop the private school. Okay, so that's sort 
of a style of management, isn't it? Right. And that

22:04.102 --> 22:07.246
evolved, you know, you learn as you go along. One 
other that has occurred here that involves Texas

22:10.068 --> 22:27.711
A&M and Rice and the University of Texas, the 
University of Houston, with the formation of the

22:10.068 --> 22:27.711
then the Houston Area Research Center, which has 
modified its name to the Houston Advanced

22:10.068 --> 22:27.711
Research Center, still using the acronym HART. 
But that's modeled after the research triangle in

22:28.552 --> 22:33.940
North Carolina. When North Carolina looked at 
itself and its economic futures. Back in the 60s,

22:43.485 --> 22:49.071
they tried to assess what their strengths were. 
And the tobacco industry was going down,

22:49.091 --> 22:53.776
agriculture was going down. But they had a strong 
involvement of academic institutions and a need

22:54.437 --> 23:02.105
for research. So they formed this 5,000-acre 
block of land called the Research Triangle. is a

23:09.029 --> 23:16.258
triangle actually between the University of 
North Carolina and the North Carolina State and

23:09.029 --> 23:16.258
Duke. And they formed something very similar to 
HART, which is the Research Triangle Institute.

23:22.206 --> 23:32.640
And it was the nucleus that has led to the 
development of more than 30,000 jobs in that

23:22.206 --> 23:32.640
location now, and the world-renowned for its 
research activities and high-tech

23:22.206 --> 23:32.640
manufacturing. facilities. I guess IBM is the 
largest single employer there. What was the

23:36.698 --> 23:38.339
initiative behind the park? Were you involved in 
that? Yeah, I was involved in it on the periphery.

23:41.804 --> 23:47.991
George Mitchell, once again, had the notion, had 
the bulldog determination to make it work.

23:48.351 --> 23:51.295
Willing to put some of his personal funds into it to 
make it work. The company donated, agreed to

23:52.656 --> 23:58.864
donate 100 acres of land for our campus upon which 
it would be built. And provided some of the initial

24:02.320 --> 24:31.298
funding for the first several buildings that were 
built and now it it once again is a freestanding

24:02.320 --> 24:31.298
non-profit corporation not under the control and 
direction anyway of the woodlands corporation

24:02.320 --> 24:31.298
but it is here in the woodland and it does things 
that benefits the community do you have a sense it

24:02.320 --> 24:31.298
sounds to me like what you're saying is the 
strategic planning occurs in the head of your

24:02.320 --> 24:31.298
commission well a lot of the initiative comes from 
that we've to try to put it into a strategic plan

24:31.733 --> 24:36.759
that can be implemented from there. He tried a lot 
of the vision that has gone into this place. Do you

24:40.423 --> 24:51.075
have a sense or an opinion of the beauty of what 
you've described is

24:40.423 --> 24:51.075
the plan already existed. It becomes more 
important because of some economic turmoil in

24:51.976 --> 24:57.623
Texas. The notion to diversify the Houston 
economy, of course, is also going to benefit the

24:58.160 --> 25:04.165
Woodlands tremendously. And these other 
policies that have developed, such as the attempt

25:04.866 --> 25:17.117
to get a portion of the University of Houston 
campus here, the Hark, all these other kind of

25:04.866 --> 25:17.117
things, all feed into the same goal. I guess what 
I'd like to know is, or it would be interesting to

25:17.137 --> 25:26.445
ascertain your sense of

25:30.374 --> 25:39.506
of how you fit into that strategic planning 
matrix. You're involved also in making policies.

25:45.815 --> 25:54.386
What we're trying to do as we interview people is 
identify what's the contribution of this

25:45.815 --> 25:54.386
individual toward the whole that is becoming the 
woodlands. And

25:55.047 --> 25:59.453
for all time and eternity, Someone's going to say, 
Roger Galatis did A, B, C. Where do you fit? Well, I

26:06.848 --> 26:22.068
guess I would have to say that I'm deeply involved 
in the overall planning and development process

26:06.848 --> 26:22.068
as it relates to the day-to-day functions that 
take place in this community. I have a deep

26:22.228 --> 26:27.735
involvement personally with people in the 
community. this community is not going to be any

26:28.593 --> 26:33.118
stronger than the fabric that holds it together. 
And I guess if I have a sense of mission myself, it's

26:33.919 --> 26:47.073
to make sure that the institutions that are put in 
place fit into the overall strategy of what's

26:33.919 --> 26:47.073
being accomplished here in the woodlands. We work 
closely with churches. We work closely with

26:49.936 --> 26:51.998
community groups. We work closely with the 
schools. We work closely with things like the

26:56.268 --> 27:01.055
Lions Club and their fundraising activities. We 
work closely with the YMCA. I was personally

27:04.199 --> 27:09.767
involved in helping bring the YMCA, a regional 
YMCA, into the Woodlands. I serve on the board of

27:09.787 --> 27:13.653
the private school and the board of the hospital. 
And I guess my function is to make sure this grand

27:14.654 --> 27:25.009
strategy is implemented in a timely and effective 
way. I would like to think I add something to that

27:26.812 --> 27:38.685
vision, but when placed against Mr. Mitchell's 
vision, I guess few of us here would reach to those

27:26.812 --> 27:38.685
great heights. I say that. But you implement it. 
Yeah, and there are a lot of us implementing it. I'm

27:44.812 --> 27:45.293
not sure. George's vision, I don't mind saying 
this on tape, and I don't mind you writing it down so

27:46.814 --> 27:53.562
George can hear it, but I only wish I was doing about 
20% of the things that George Mitchell thinks I'm

27:53.947 --> 27:57.992
doing. He's a very stimulating individual, and he 
has a,

27:59.113 --> 28:10.708
he says if you're not working on five or six things 
at one time, you're not being productive. And we

28:10.728 --> 28:23.464
all have, it's a challenge to accomplish all the 
things that George would like to have

28:10.728 --> 28:23.464
accomplished in a time frame that he thinks would 
be appropriate and suitable. But he also is a very

28:24.305 --> 28:28.149
understanding individual. And he's 
compassionate,

28:29.351 --> 28:44.367
sometimes not understood by everyone that comes 
in contact with him initially, because he is

28:29.351 --> 28:44.367
thinking about the future. And so many of us are 
focused on today's problem. When you see these

28:48.072 --> 28:50.194
things, such as the medical Park, I guess, and the 
research park, the Cooper School. Are you

28:57.177 --> 29:02.343
essentially putting a ship out at sea to see what's 
going to happen, I guess? No, I think we have a

29:02.764 --> 29:05.447
rudder on the ship. I think we have a sense of 
direction. And sometimes when we start, though,

29:07.169 --> 29:14.318
we don't know exactly how we're going to get there, 
exactly what form it's going to take. And I don't

29:14.338 --> 29:19.725
think that's necessarily a combination of the 
management of this place. Sometimes you just

29:20.026 --> 29:33.026
don't have all the answers, you know, where you'd 
like to get to, you know, what you'd like the

29:20.026 --> 29:33.026
mission to be, what you'd like to accomplish, but 
you're really not sure just to judge how you're

29:20.026 --> 29:33.026
going to get there, how it's all going to be funded. 
And I think if you took time to understand all that,

29:33.747 --> 29:39.817
you may not get there. Yeah. Is that, in fact, the 
uniqueness of the woodlands? You mentioned

29:44.744 --> 29:47.248
Kingwood, which is completely different. I mean, 
it's a nice community, but it's a completely

29:47.617 --> 29:51.142
different. Yeah, I worked there for a long time. 
The orientation of just driving through the

29:52.464 --> 29:54.386
place. It's different. It's totally different. 
Is the uniqueness of the woodlands, this emphasis

29:57.150 --> 30:04.060
on infrastructure, what you're talking about, is 
that really what sets it apart from? Well, I think

30:04.080 --> 30:06.022
there's several things that sets it apart. One, I 
can kind of list them, and this is not saying we're

30:06.042 --> 30:17.438
better or they're better, but it's an observation

30:06.042 --> 30:17.438
of differences. or diligently to preserve the 
natural environment, natural vegetation. You

30:21.576 --> 30:24.500
drive into the woodlands, and you don't see 30,000 
people. And you don't see 5 million square feet of

30:24.660 --> 30:28.845
on-road space. And you don't see 12,000 homes. You 
don't see a conference center. And to the people

30:33.251 --> 30:37.296
who live here, they really like that. To some 
people who see it for the first time, they don't

30:37.336 --> 30:40.260
understand it. And it's not traditional. And it's 
a marketing challenge, frankly,

30:47.236 --> 30:54.286
people when they're moving into the Houston 
region, they like things that they have seen in

30:47.236 --> 30:54.286
other places and they relate to them. But if we can 
get a shot at them and talk to them for a while and let

30:54.306 --> 31:05.903
them talk to people who live here, they will 
understand that this natural environment and

30:54.306 --> 31:05.903
natural vegetation is really dysfunctional. It 
serves to eliminate the stormwater runoff that

31:06.904 --> 31:12.973
forms more water when you urbanize the place 
you're not creating flooding on your neighbors

31:13.662 --> 31:41.762
adjacent to you it provides a buffer for sound a 
visual buffer it provides an environment for

31:13.662 --> 31:41.762
sustaining wildlife just down the street there's 
a bank building between here and the bank building

31:13.662 --> 31:41.762
it's not uncommon to see deer crossing the road and 
it's in a fairly populated area but the wildlife

31:13.662 --> 31:41.762
still is evident here, and it will continue to be 
that. Twenty-five percent of the land is being set

31:47.112 --> 31:53.339
aside as a permanent open space as far as the 
development plan. Twenty-five percent. Another

31:56.543 --> 32:07.375
thing that is different here as compared to other 
places is when you drive in, you don't see the

31:56.543 --> 32:07.375
typical grocery store on the right and the service 
station on the left. You have to drive back into the

32:07.395 --> 32:09.437
community. to village centers to find shopping 
and retail facilities. Actually, it's located

32:15.176 --> 32:17.860
convenient to where people live. You just don't 
drive past it coming in and leaving. Another thing

32:22.846 --> 32:38.665
that is, I think, strikingly different is this 
intensive effort to create economic growth

32:22.846 --> 32:38.665
within the community and not be just a residential 
commuter community, but to give people an

32:22.846 --> 32:38.665
opportunity to live and work in the same 
environment without the necessity to get in an

32:39.286 --> 32:46.358
automobile and drive great distances to go to 
work. I guess those are three things that I would

32:48.221 --> 32:51.486
say are different. And the scope of the Woodlands 
is different. The size is 25,000 acres. Kingwood

32:55.713 --> 32:59.058
is 14,000 acres. The Woodlands is the largest 
single landmass that's been developed in the

32:59.078 --> 33:05.108
history of the You also mentioned the church. 
Wasn't there a concerted effort by the Women's

33:07.862 --> 33:20.941
Corporation to, in fact, incorporate, invite, in 
fact, sustain religious and social and, again,

33:07.862 --> 33:20.941
these quality of life? Yeah. In the early days, 
there was created something called interfaith.

33:26.048 --> 33:35.922
And interfaith is not an ecumenical

33:26.048 --> 33:35.922
movement to do away with individual 
denominations at all. In Columbia, Maryland,

33:36.796 --> 33:41.062
that was attempted, and it failed. It was going to 
be one church, you know, when you start dealing

33:41.082 --> 33:50.395
with the religious community and doing away with 
the domination, you're treading on thin ice. But

33:50.876 --> 33:58.506
here, the Interfaith was an umbrella 
organization that helped fledgling churches

33:50.876 --> 33:58.506
find a site in the woodlands. We helped them build a 
building, which served as a place for a

34:00.048 --> 34:05.436
congregation to meet in the lake before they built 
the building. It sort of coordinated the early

34:05.956 --> 34:16.570
religious activity with each religious 
denomination, keeping their own identity

34:05.956 --> 34:16.570
intact. And that organization still exists. It 
operates a daycare center. It has an outreach

34:21.657 --> 34:24.601
program for senior citizens. It does a lot of 
charitable things in addition to coordinating

34:24.621 --> 34:29.127
activities for churches. But right now, I think 
there are 19 church buildings in the Woodlands

34:29.147 --> 34:34.815
that have been built. Some 23 congregations, two 
or three have not yet built their own sanctuary.

34:42.732 --> 34:45.394
See, I think that's significant. How do you make 
money off the churches? Well, you don't. You

34:47.756 --> 34:48.497
don't, that's right. But it helps develop a fabric 
in the community. That's right, that's right. And

34:52.761 --> 34:55.223
another thing we've done here, I'm proud of this. 
I've been involved in this from the outset. We have

34:58.526 --> 35:04.791
had an ongoing program to provide housing for 
senior citizens. And it takes... various forms

35:06.470 --> 35:33.456
one we have subsidized housing for seniors who 
cannot afford to rent apartments so we have some

35:06.470 --> 35:33.456
600 700 rental apartments that is subsidized and 
that that's a negative word in a lot of places

35:06.470 --> 35:33.456
subsidized housing you think how detrimental 
that would be to other property values but in fact

35:06.470 --> 35:33.456
it has not been here but senior citizens live in 
rental apartments We have a congregate care

35:33.773 --> 35:45.947
facility with 300 units in that where people need 
some assistance in living, but not at the level of

35:33.773 --> 35:45.947
the nursing home. But we do have a nursing home 
here, too. And we have four generations of

35:49.311 --> 35:54.597
families living in the wilderness today, and 
we're only 16 years old. And it's worked this way.

35:56.179 --> 35:59.242
First, the young couple comes to buy a home. 
They've been transferred here from Ohio. And they

36:02.343 --> 36:04.246
have a couple of young children. So that's two 
generations there. When their parents retire in

36:06.890 --> 36:18.687
Ohio, instead of moving to Florida and not knowing 
them in Sun City, where you don't know anybody

36:06.890 --> 36:18.687
except other people who are retired, they have 
elected to come and live close to their children.

36:18.707 --> 36:19.087
THE PRESIDENT. So that's really happening. 
THAT'S RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT. And even the

36:21.210 --> 36:23.393
great-grandparents have come. And there are 
housing opportunities throughout the Woodlands

36:23.934 --> 36:32.046
for that, those four generations.

36:32.347 --> 37:00.683
retirees live in subsidized housing some choose 
to live by their own home and live independently

36:32.347 --> 37:00.683
just as you and i would do that but there's been this 
this concerted effort to create the extended

36:32.347 --> 37:00.683
family in reverse you know after world war ii 
families were scattered across the united states

36:32.347 --> 37:00.683
and the grandparents stayed back at home and the 
kids left and they formed their home in another

36:32.347 --> 37:00.683
city and kids didn't get to grow up with their 
grandparents. I think something happened to

37:03.999 --> 37:10.568
society during those years, in the 50s and 60s. And 
here in the Woodlands, I'm pleased that we're part

37:10.588 --> 37:16.637
of bringing some families back together. True, 
it's an economic opportunity for us, but also it's

37:17.017 --> 37:24.508
a strengthening of family ties. Is this basically 
the S&M of your demographic plan, I guess that is,

37:30.059 --> 37:33.203
that it's a family-oriented community. Well, 
it's family. We have a fairly good number of

37:37.008 --> 37:40.191
singles that live here. I think 40% of the families 
who live here have no children. And that's a

37:44.577 --> 37:47.721
national trend across this country. Families are 
waiting later to have children. Some have none at

37:49.423 --> 37:52.827
all.

37:54.038 --> 38:20.299
there are also very strong family ties that exist 
in the community too what about an economic

37:54.038 --> 38:20.299
spectrum of the society trying to provide 
something for everyone yeah as i say we have

37:54.038 --> 38:20.299
subsidized housing for the elderly we have 
subsidized housing for families or individuals

37:54.038 --> 38:20.299
who don't qualify for it i guess in total there are 
1500 subsidized units in the woods or something

37:54.038 --> 38:20.299
like that We have more subsidized housing in the 
woodlands than any other community in Houston

38:20.650 --> 38:27.399
that is a planned community. Is it subsidized only 
for the elderly? No, some for families,

38:29.121 --> 38:32.846
low-income families, low- and moderate-income 
families. And that's to get a mix. Yeah, it was. The

38:37.433 --> 38:49.108
social scheme of planning was to provide the broad 
cross-section of housing opportunities for a

38:37.433 --> 38:49.108
heterogeneous population. That's got to fit the 
new community. Yeah, well, that was part of the new

38:51.008 --> 39:00.216
community program that was conceived by the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, which

38:51.008 --> 39:00.216
failed miserably. This is the only community out 
of 13 that was formed under that Title VII new

39:00.677 --> 39:13.729
community program that came about in 1971 that 
succeeded, that did not go into foreclosure.

39:13.749 --> 39:19.294
There are several that are still active, but it was 
after they went into foreclosure and they did not

39:13.749 --> 39:19.294
pay the bond of indebtedness that they were 
obligated to pay. But this one succeeded, and it

39:23.800 --> 39:31.752
succeeded, I think, for some very valid, basic 
reasons. One, it was adjacent to a growing

39:31.772 --> 39:35.578
metropolitan area. It was on a major interstate 
highway that led into the business district, and

39:36.179 --> 39:42.308
we were not too far removed from that. We were close 
to an international airport. There was good

39:46.223 --> 39:54.301
transportation, there were jobs existing in the 
local area, and the ones who failed didn't meet

39:46.223 --> 39:54.301
those criteria. It was a social experiment with 
the notion that if you started a new city out in an

39:55.644 --> 40:05.346
isolated part of the world, people would transfer 
from the inner city and all those problems they had

40:06.035 --> 40:12.842
would go away and they would start life anew and 
things would be wonderful and great. But it

40:14.003 --> 40:15.324
doesn't work that way. People who move into this 
community bring the problems with them that they

40:15.504 --> 40:19.789
had. I think the environment helps them deal with 
those problems, perhaps, and cope with them. But

40:25.414 --> 40:28.678
it certainly doesn't do away with them. By having a 
good school system, and we do have a good public

40:29.358 --> 40:33.983
school system, I mentioned the private school, 
And that didn't come about out of dissatisfaction

40:34.418 --> 40:40.207
with public schools, it's just a supplement to the 
public schools. But by having a good school

40:40.227 --> 41:03.042
system, this growing family relationship, jobs 
in the local area, I think a good array of

40:40.227 --> 41:03.042
recreational opportunities that kids can use as 
well as adults, the involvement of churches in the

40:40.227 --> 41:03.042
community, and the establishment of traditional 
institutions the YMCA, the YWCA, the Kiwanis

41:03.494 --> 41:14.826
Club, the Lion Club, the Rotary Club, all of those 
kind of things have come together in a very nice way

41:03.494 --> 41:14.826
here in the Woodlands. Let me ask you one other 
question. You piqued my curiosity. I've heard

41:17.689 --> 41:30.023
four times now, and it's all exactly the same, you 
know, one of the reasons why the Woodlands

41:17.689 --> 41:30.023
succeeded, whether it's because it's close to a 
major metropolitan area, it's on the interstate,

41:17.689 --> 41:30.023
you know, the airport number. Did that come out of, 
and an in-house study, or was there an independent

41:32.165 --> 41:34.809
study? Because everyone we've talked to says the 
same thing. Well, maybe we were lucky we bought the

41:39.996 --> 42:00.484
land in the right place, but George Mitchell, once 
again in an attempt to diversify his own company,

41:39.996 --> 42:00.484
which was predominantly oil and gas, and still is 
largely oil and gas, saw the growing north side of

41:39.996 --> 42:00.484
Houston as a a real estate development 
opportunity and he started acquiring lands here

42:01.139 --> 42:24.447
in the early 60s through the mid-60s and there were 
a number of large timber companies that owned

42:01.139 --> 42:24.447
sizable types of land and taxes and other reasons 
made it non-productive for timber use and george

42:01.139 --> 42:24.447
bought a lot of land for a very reasonable price and 
i don't think George may disagree with it, but I

42:24.781 --> 42:29.468
don't think George knew exactly what he was going 
to do with it when he was buying it. He had not

42:30.189 --> 42:45.051
formulated all the plans, but he knew that the 
north side of Houston was the intercontinental

42:30.189 --> 42:45.051
airport, the interstate highway to Dallas, the 
wooded environment, the low cost of land at that

42:30.189 --> 42:45.051
time, the growth of Houston. All of those were 
ingredients that would lead toward a successful

42:45.893 --> 42:52.763
real estate development, which at that time was 
not I don't think it's totally defined. It evolved

42:55.232 --> 42:59.156
over a series of years of planning. Did he say that? 
No, that he bought the land. In fact, some of it he

43:04.421 --> 43:12.069
just bought, actually thinking he couldn't lose 
because he could cut the timber off it and come out

43:04.421 --> 43:12.069
ahead. Yeah, in fact, he said that. I think this 
thing has, George's enthusiasm and vision has led

43:17.474 --> 43:22.699
the way, but He's attracted some good people to 
come and help him think through the process, too,

43:23.371 --> 43:28.637
in the early days. But one thing that's 
interesting to me, it does seem that you have a

43:28.657 --> 43:33.763
style of management here that I haven't seen in too 
many places. I teach business and economic

43:33.943 --> 43:36.766
history. But what you're doing is creating these 
little autonomous divisions here that are really

43:36.786 --> 43:44.816
not controlled by you and that you're involved 
with. I'm not sure what management style that is,

43:44.836 --> 43:51.724
decentralization and diversification or 
something like that, but it seems to work.

43:51.744 --> 43:52.905
Actually, developing... communities is a 
management style that you probably don't find in

43:53.122 --> 43:59.070
other places. You're involved in this thing 24 
hours a day, seven days a week, and you're involved

43:59.190 --> 44:07.040
with people who are your neighbors, and that's 
another point I want to make. I think one thing

44:07.060 --> 44:13.628
that's made us successful in dealing with the 
community is we're not absentee developers. Most

44:13.708 --> 44:21.458
of our employees live right here in the Woodlands, 
and we see our neighbors, and we see them in the

44:13.708 --> 44:21.458
grocery store, and we see them at functions, and So 
when a problem develops, they're dealing with

44:21.944 --> 44:26.008
somebody they know. And it's on a different level 
than if it's a big developer in another city that is

44:26.889 --> 44:35.677
controlling this place and controlling my life. 
Now, that's not to say that there are not some

44:36.437 --> 44:40.661
problems that develop in the community. There are 
things that some people in the community want that

44:41.842 --> 44:51.411
we can't provide, can't provide in the way that 
they perceive to be timely. There are some people

44:51.593 --> 44:56.100
that even say they've been deceived and misled. I 
would debate that with them, but nonetheless, if

44:56.160 --> 45:01.108
they feel that way, they feel that way. But that's a 
very small minority of people. And I'm pleased at

45:04.694 --> 45:09.922
the good relationship we have in this community. I 
live here, have a phone number and a telephone

45:10.022 --> 45:17.133
book, and don't feel uncomfortable at all in going 
wherever I go. And really am not... not put in any

45:20.534 --> 45:26.100
awkward positions because I... Because you're in 
a corporation. Yeah, right. And I think other

45:26.560 --> 45:31.586
people who live here and work here have that same 
experience. Since being president of the company

45:32.967 --> 45:39.915
in 1986, what have been your primary 
preoccupations, let's say? What have you had both

45:39.935 --> 45:43.158
an incentive accomplishment and nightmares 
about, I guess? Well, you know, in 1986, the

45:43.779 --> 45:48.904
economy of Houston was at its lowest to have 
been... at least in my memory. So the challenge of

45:51.979 --> 46:00.368
continuing to develop and maintain this 
community at a profitable level was certainly a

45:51.979 --> 46:00.368
challenge. We had to trim our workforce. We had to 
cut back our capital budgets. We had to do things

46:05.574 --> 46:08.016
that other companies did. And frankly, some of 
that was not very pleasant on a personal basis. but

46:12.897 --> 46:41.723
we did it and we survived what about your 
relationship with the builders for example

46:12.897 --> 46:41.723
they're very good builders like building in the 
woodlands we have about 20 home builders that

46:12.897 --> 46:41.723
purchase lots from us to build homes we help some of 
them market their homes and some sell their own but

46:12.897 --> 46:41.723
they like working in an environment like the 
woodlands because we we're not incorporated so we

46:12.897 --> 46:41.723
don't have an infection system imposed upon us by a 
city But we have established architectural

46:42.209 --> 46:55.149
controls, building standards, and put in effect 
an inspection program of our own so that every

46:42.209 --> 46:55.149
builder has to meet certain quality standards. 
And they like that because no one takes advantage

46:55.169 --> 46:58.454
of the system. They're all on a level playing 
field. And so they can build to those quality

47:00.978 --> 47:10.292
standards and know that somebody else is not 
undercutting their marketing by building a

47:00.978 --> 47:10.292
second quality We

47:10.677 --> 47:21.112
have building inspectors. We have one person who 
does nothing but inspect the clearing of building

47:21.172 --> 47:31.648
sites to make sure that they're not over-cleared 
during the construction process. You can look at

47:31.728 --> 47:38.558
the buildings here and you see it's only cleared 
five or ten feet away from the construction of that

47:31.728 --> 47:38.558
building. That's not by accident. You really have 
to work at that. Well, I bet you do. The temptation

47:42.676 --> 47:47.250
or tendency of builders... Come in with a 
bulldozer. Let's get all the trees out of the way so

47:47.270 --> 47:51.062
we can build a house, and then we'll plant some 
trees after we get...
