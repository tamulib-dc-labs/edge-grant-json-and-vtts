WEBVTT

00:01.617 --> 00:12.578
The 16th, Monday morning, and I am visiting with 
Dr. Herman Brown, head of the Department of

00:01.617 --> 00:12.578
Agricultural Education.

00:15.263 --> 00:21.094
Back to August, I mean November 16th at Scotes 
Hall. Scotes Hall. Scotes Hall Inn. Texas A&M

00:24.483 --> 00:29.053
University, Dr. Herman Brown, head of the 
Department of Agricultural Education. And we're

00:29.493 --> 00:31.959
going to talk a little bit about changes. And 
you've been here since 19... 66. 66.

00:37.390 --> 00:39.895
You preceded the College of Education. Yes. And 
you were in the Department of? agriculture

00:43.990 --> 00:46.233
education at the time. Right. See, I have not got 
this department straight in my head. I know I've

00:50.297 --> 00:58.567
already visited a couple of people, and it's in the 
part in the education and part in the agriculture.

00:58.587 --> 01:02.311
We have a dual appointment, College of Education, 
College of Agriculture. Administratively,

01:02.331 --> 01:10.420
we're in the College of Agriculture, but 
nationally our ties with the College of Education

01:02.331 --> 01:10.420
as it relates to certification. To 
certification, all right. Primarily

01:12.715 --> 01:14.418
certification. Again, there's other courtesies 
extended here in the employment of personnel and

01:14.438 --> 01:19.565
so forth. Okay. Now, tell me a little bit about A&M 
when you were here in 66 and some of the major

01:20.246 --> 01:31.342
changes as they relate more to the College of 
Education, because my dissertation is the

01:20.246 --> 01:31.342
history of the College of Education. I know 
there's a little bit written up to 1967. There was a

01:35.207 --> 01:38.652
Robey thesis that talked a little bit about what 
happened before the college was initiated. So can

01:41.233 --> 01:44.788
you take it from there for a little bit? In 1966, we 
were Department of Education. At that time, Dr.

01:48.824 --> 01:53.430
Frank Hubert was responsible for that. He had 
other responsibilities in the College of Liberal

01:53.490 --> 01:56.574
Arts. Naturally, in 1966, total enrollment at 
Texas A&M was possibly, I don't recall

01:57.715 --> 02:06.687
specifically, 7 or 8,000 students. So we're 
certainly not talking about size magnitude then

02:06.727 --> 02:12.334
as we are now. at that particular time we were just 
bringing in our first females we did not have a

02:12.770 --> 02:41.747
large department of education at that time our 
relationship really in ag education has not

02:12.770 --> 02:41.747
changed that much because we were still in 
agriculture but our ties were very strong with the

02:12.770 --> 02:41.747
college of education we serve as we do today on all 
of their committees unless it's an in-house type

02:42.098 --> 02:43.560
of college committee. At that time we served on the 
Council on Teacher Education just as we do now.

02:51.190 --> 03:10.215
Certainly the numbers, I think the quality is not, 
certainly not what is demanded today because at

02:51.190 --> 03:10.215
that time the College of Education was no 
different than any other segment of the

02:51.190 --> 03:10.215
university as far as grade point requirements or 
any other standardized test. Yes, I think we've

03:10.516 --> 03:16.528
come a long way since 1966 or the past 21 years from 
our perspective. And other than the women and some

03:17.890 --> 03:30.735
of these, you know, the growth, is there anything 
that in the external environment that affected

03:17.890 --> 03:30.735
your department growth or your... other than just 
the numbers growing? Have there been changes in

03:35.442 --> 03:39.850
society or philosophical change? Any kind of 
changes that have affected your department? It

03:42.915 --> 03:50.850
seems as the university has increased in numbers, 
our numbers have steadily declined over the

03:42.915 --> 03:50.850
years. We are more directly associated with 
agriculture than what we are education. And as I

03:57.336 --> 04:02.902
put both of those together, agriculture and 
education, that's somewhat of a vulgar term. It's

04:02.983 --> 04:06.207
not an in vogue term today among people. Both of 
them have a negative connotation. And so we have

04:09.090 --> 04:13.455
slipped in enrollment through the years. We have 
managed to turn that around at this point in time.

04:19.282 --> 04:25.749
But our numbers in the department are not today 
what they were in 1966 or 1970. Give me

04:26.329 --> 04:32.456
just a couple of numbers just for ideas. Say maybe 
what's your enrollment now versus what it might

04:32.576 --> 04:35.779
have been. OK, our enrollment right now is 
approximately 160 undergraduate students. And

04:40.824 --> 04:45.669
in 1970, it would be something like 225.

04:48.312 --> 04:48.512
OK. When you say negative connotations,

04:49.387 --> 04:56.558
do you mean that both things have negative 
connotations? Well, yes, there's lots of things

04:56.578 --> 05:00.264
involved here. Agriculture, first of all, the 
economy is down. An oversupply, an overabundance

05:03.690 --> 05:08.998
of agricultural commodities. We have an emphasis 
on the so-called higher education track system in

05:09.350 --> 05:22.466
our public schools, in which very few students are 
really encouraged to go into agriculture. For

05:22.486 --> 05:31.797
example, if you have a 1200 SAT, school counselors 
are prone to recommend one of these so-called

05:22.486 --> 05:31.797
professions, or what I refer to as a syndrome, my 
son the medical doctor, my daughter the lawyer.

05:40.302 --> 05:47.592
Those professional things, I believe, have 
captured the eye and imagination of our

05:40.302 --> 05:47.592
counselors. Counselors have a profound impact 
upon young people and where they go to school in

05:47.672 --> 05:53.640
their advisement. So with that combination, I 
think that we've had to restructure our

05:53.941 --> 06:00.670
recruitment procedures for... to maintain 
enrollment. And you said you're turning that

06:03.096 --> 06:05.159
around right now. Is there something special that 
you're doing?

06:09.705 --> 06:27.990
We're working primarily with teachers of 
agricultural science in our public schools and

06:09.705 --> 06:27.990
the extension people, asking them just to provide 
us with one or two names of outstanding students in

06:09.705 --> 06:27.990
their school who might have an interest in 
agriculture. at the senior, junior, sophomore,

06:28.240 --> 06:32.371
and freshman level. We have selected about 150 
teachers across the state. They provide us with

06:37.825 --> 06:41.575
that information and then What we do is we get on the 
telephone and call these people. And say sometime

06:47.794 --> 06:59.731
at 6 o'clock in the afternoon, and that's when Mama 
is home fixing the evening meal, and we really

06:47.794 --> 06:59.731
don't want to talk to the student as much as we want 
to talk to Mama. We recruit mothers, and if we can

06:59.751 --> 07:10.887
sell them on the idea that we will certainly look 
after the son or daughter while we've got a friend,

06:59.751 --> 07:10.887
then it makes recruitment much easier for us. As

07:11.221 --> 07:23.798
the changes now in this case, it's reversed for you 
because most of them, the numbers have gotten so

07:11.221 --> 07:23.798
big that my question is how has it affected your 
working with students? Does the numbers allow you

07:23.858 --> 07:31.268
to have more time then to work or interact with 
students or is it the same? No, no difference from

07:31.649 --> 07:33.651
that perspective. For the simple reason we have 
several service courses in this department. So as

07:38.575 --> 07:52.828
the university increases its enrollment and the 
placement of the core curriculum, which includes

07:38.575 --> 07:52.828
some of our particular courses, then we've had to 
increase the number of service courses that we

07:38.575 --> 07:52.828
provide. Which are the core curriculums? For 
example, Agricultural Ed 440 Methods of

07:55.471 --> 08:05.100
Technological Change is one of the social science 
courses that's adopted. Okay. committee and we

08:05.744 --> 08:12.252
also have one 340, a youth leadership training 
program. And I'd say in those two courses, 90% of

08:12.273 --> 08:19.202
the students are our total enrollment, non-AGET 
students. In fact, in the teacher certification

08:21.525 --> 08:31.077
option, those two courses are not even required.

08:32.778 --> 08:43.128
I'm asking this a lot in the College of Education, 
and I don't know how it pertains more to the

08:32.778 --> 08:43.128
agriculture, but the mission of the land grant is 
the teaching, the service, and the research. How

08:43.569 --> 08:45.530
is that balanced in your department? Do you 
emphasize one more than the other, or are they

08:45.571 --> 08:49.274
equal? Well, certainly the teaching, research, 
and service is the part that you're talking about

08:49.294 --> 08:57.162
here. We feel like we're strong in teaching. We 
feel like that we're exceptionally strong in

09:00.993 --> 09:08.561
service activities, in working with people on a 
non-credit type basis. We recognize the need for

09:09.222 --> 09:14.869
research, but that is by far our weakest area. We 
have research going on, but funding becomes a

09:15.069 --> 09:27.743
major problem, and we are not a member of the 
Agricultural Experiment Station in the College

09:15.069 --> 09:27.743
of Agriculture, which funds the research. And 
because most of our research is in the area of

09:28.364 --> 09:35.035
developmental research. And that does not seem to 
be the major thrust of research today in the social

09:35.696 --> 09:42.447
sciences.

09:45.452 --> 09:50.119
Okay, now collaboration, and obviously because 
you're in both departments You have some

09:50.555 --> 09:52.698
collaboration with both. Is there collaboration 
between your department and other areas to any

09:52.718 --> 09:57.144
great extent? Well, as I put it out here, we're 
already outside for one thing. So I look upon our

10:04.334 --> 10:09.842
collaboration with the College of Education just 
as much as any other college. Certainly right now

10:09.862 --> 10:14.649
our inquiry group, we're a vital part of that. So 
I'd say... Well, Sylvia, we have an opportunity

10:19.208 --> 10:21.552
here. We get to serve on twice as many committees as 
most other departments. And so, you know, it's

10:28.001 --> 10:32.608
really reinforced. Do you consider that a plus or a 
minus? I consider it a plus. Now, it does get

10:38.938 --> 10:40.741
time-consuming. I think if we could spend some 
time on research instead of preparation for these

10:41.301 --> 10:47.531
meetings. For example... We have two department 
head meetings a month in the College of Education,

10:48.655 --> 10:55.342
whereas we only have one in the College of 
Agriculture. So I find no problem with this for the

10:56.023 --> 11:12.200
simple reason that what one dean brings up in one 
way, then the other will bring it up in another way,

10:56.023 --> 11:12.200
then I feel like I can understand what is needed a 
little bit better. So there's no problem there.

11:14.677 --> 11:18.183
HOW ABOUT PERCEPTIONS OUTSIDE THE COLLEGE? YOU 
KNOW, HOW IS THE COLLEGE? WE TOUCHED A LITTLE BIT

11:20.106 --> 11:23.572
ABOUT IT AND ABOUT COUNSELOR'S PERCEPTIONS AND SO 
FORTH. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? I GET THE IDEA SINCE

11:24.874 --> 11:38.316
I SERVE ON A DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL, MEANING THAT THE 
DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL IN YOUR COLLEGE IS

11:24.874 --> 11:38.316
EXCEPTIONAL AND IS ABLE TO RAISE TONS OF MONEY 
BECAUSE EVERYBODY OUT THERE, YOU KNOW, IS VERY

11:24.874 --> 11:38.316
SUCCESSFUL AND HAS ALL KINDS OF MONEY. WHEREAS FOR 
THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION, WE HAVE HAD very

11:41.677 --> 11:45.162
difficult time raising any amount of money 
whatsoever. So how does that... Well, okay. Now

11:49.207 --> 11:59.841
here, I don't want to get on the bandwagon a little 
bit, but this is one of the primary reasons that

11:49.207 --> 11:59.841
education is not a profession to begin with. And 
until we become a profession, we are going to have

12:00.763 --> 12:07.812
that difficult time of raising money. Now the 
medical doctors, one of the One criteria for being

12:10.246 --> 12:17.918
a profession is that the profession supports its 
students with scholarships. We see that in the

12:18.859 --> 12:20.922
medical profession. We see that in engineering. 
We see that in the law profession, the ministerial

12:22.465 --> 12:27.132
profession, all of those things. So until we 
arrive at that point. Now the other thing, true

12:30.176 --> 12:33.541
dedicated teachers don't have money. I mean, 
gosh, after all, They have a salary. It's a

12:37.434 --> 12:38.815
full-time job. You can't make your millions and 
fortunes just in the summertime. So really,

12:43.580 --> 12:59.675
teaching is more of a dedicated group of people 
where the fiscal or financial rewards do not seem

12:43.580 --> 12:59.675
to be as paramount as it does with those involved in 
private business. So I think we're just going to

12:59.735 --> 13:04.519
have to accept we will never be an elitist group 
from that point of view. Now, there may be some

13:07.456 --> 13:11.683
things that we need to do. For example, the former 
Students Association here at A&M is stronger now

13:14.026 --> 13:23.880
than it was 20 years ago because of numbers. The 
College of Education is still in its infancy, and I

13:23.900 --> 13:31.992
think in time to come, maybe 25 years down the road, 
then yes, we will be able to attract some dollars.

13:37.158 --> 13:39.463
But I don't see any way of doing it this time. It's a 
losing cause.

13:45.775 --> 13:50.879
OK, you just touched a little bit about the future 
and what the College of Education might be later

13:45.775 --> 13:50.879
on. What about this upheaval in the whole new 
teacher training program and how everybody's

13:50.939 --> 13:58.406
going to be affected by that, or at least some 
departments? Now, you have your students take,

13:58.426 --> 14:06.853
are there some that take education courses, or is 
it, how is the tie? For example, an undergraduate

14:07.473 --> 14:15.360
student, do they take half of the courses here and 
half in the College of Education, or do they have to

14:07.473 --> 14:15.360
just take the number of courses to be certified? 
OK. We have what we call vocational

14:16.387 --> 14:21.632
certification. And really, don't ask me how to 
differentiate between secondary

14:22.352 --> 14:28.158
certification, vocational education. I don't 
see that different. Now, our students have a

14:30.940 --> 14:44.112
48-hour program in agriculture, which is 
comparable to the two 24-hour teaching field. In

14:44.933 --> 14:46.174
addition to that, Currently, we have 24 hours of 
required professional education, and that has

14:46.593 --> 15:04.920
been very specifically identified as 12 hours of 
ag ed to include six hours of student teaching and

14:46.593 --> 15:04.920
12 hours from the College of Education. Now,

15:04.940 --> 15:12.972
we have followed that track for many, many years, 
The Commission on Standards of the Texas

15:13.289 --> 15:20.237
Education Agency is the one that dictated the 12 
and the 12. So

15:21.058 --> 15:27.865
those changes, we just have to live with. Are they 
going to affect you drastically? I mean, if they

15:29.607 --> 15:33.171
change where you can only take, what, 18 hours of 
education, including teaching? Then we will have

15:33.191 --> 15:39.718
12 hours of ag ed and six hours of professional 
education. we are in disagreement with some of the

15:40.340 --> 16:09.638
philosophy that's being espoused at this time as 
to a five-year program uh we contend that

15:40.340 --> 16:09.638
currently we don't really have a four-year 
program now we have a four and a half or five-year

15:40.340 --> 16:09.638
program and then you complicate this with a 
another year plus an internship year which we're

15:40.340 --> 16:09.638
talking about seven years possibly, and then this 
qualifies an individual to start at very minimum

16:10.023 --> 16:16.432
wage. Now, in this department, we're a little bit 
different than some of the others. Most of the

16:23.401 --> 16:27.627
graduates of this department will be the 
breadwinner of the family. This will not be a

16:28.267 --> 16:30.931
secondary income. So at $15,000 to $18,000 a year 
after seven years of training, will certainly be

16:39.655 --> 16:46.801
the kiss of death in many respects to this 
department as far as numbers are concerned. Now,

16:48.202 --> 16:55.729
it is my understanding that we can have companion 
four-year programs and five-year programs. So

16:57.610 --> 17:03.476
that decision, final decision, has not been made. 
We know that there's some support on this campus

17:03.856 --> 17:08.700
for the philosophy of the Holmes group, We 
understand that NCAID is revising their

17:09.862 --> 17:15.789
standards, which may have an impact on some of 
this. But to be perfectly honest with you, the time

17:16.830 --> 17:31.929
may come when an attempt will be made by this 
department as a matter of survival to withdraw

17:16.830 --> 17:31.929
from NCAID accreditation.

17:31.949 --> 17:33.611
Do you have a choice on that? No, not really. But at 
this point in time, we have two deans to satisfy.

17:40.654 --> 17:49.888
And we have a dean of agriculture who says my 
departments must all be competitive at the same

17:40.654 --> 17:49.888
number of semester credit hours. So he cannot 
afford to let one department have 130 hours for

17:49.908 --> 17:56.818
graduation and another one 155. And these are 
going to cause some problems. And then you throw in

18:01.785 --> 18:03.848
the core curriculum. I think what we're seeing 
here at this point in time that is very frustrating

18:04.469 --> 18:18.088
to the professionals in this department is that we 
have two EA standards, which is mandated

18:04.469 --> 18:18.088
legislatively. We have the Southern 
Association. We have NCATE. We have our own

18:22.395 --> 18:25.860
institutional core curriculum requirements. 
Then we have a college requirements. And then if

18:28.764 --> 18:31.067
the Holmes group comes in, It just boils down to a 
matter of how many masters can be served. So that

18:37.978 --> 18:41.702
pretty much answers my question on the future. So 
right now it seems a little fussy. There's

18:45.546 --> 18:47.629
certainly uncertainty. Okay. Now let's talk 
about Herman Brown and some of the highlights or

18:49.471 --> 18:57.960
some of the things that you have experienced. I'm 
having the difficulty getting people to express

19:01.338 --> 19:10.856
their contribution, they prefer somebody else to 
do it, but what do you feel the best about what's

19:01.338 --> 19:10.856
gone on since you've been here that you've 
impacted or influenced?

19:13.321 --> 19:22.418
Well, first of all, I think I have served on every 
committee in the university, and many of them as

19:13.321 --> 19:22.418
chairman. We're talking about faculty 
committees. We're talking about elected

19:26.089 --> 19:31.997
committees to the university under the provost, 
under the president. This is a continual thing as

19:33.700 --> 19:40.850
we continue to strive for maturity. I think that 
the greatest contribution maybe we as faculty

19:45.803 --> 19:58.098
members in this department, and specifically 
Herman Brown, to be honest with you, we are the only

19:45.803 --> 19:58.098
vocational unit at Texas A&M University. We do not 
have home economics, we don't really have T&I,

19:59.099 --> 20:06.007
business administration, health education, and 
those types of things. So I think that we have been

20:06.027 --> 20:14.157
able to add a flavor to programs, especially at the 
advanced degree level, to provide

20:14.980 --> 20:28.916
administrators and potential administrators 
with a vocational philosophy that they might not

20:14.980 --> 20:28.916
get otherwise.

20:29.497 --> 20:37.727
Give me the philosophy as you see it from this 
department or how it might differ from other ones

20:29.497 --> 20:37.727
in the College of Education, for example. Some of 
them do not have it even, it's not expressed, it's

20:37.747 --> 20:44.835
just sort of understood, but is there a philosophy 
as such from this department that you espouse?

20:48.785 --> 20:49.666
Well, sure. We have our own written goals and so 
forth, but what it boils down to is the

20:49.986 --> 20:59.755
compatibility of general education and 
vocational education. And this is another

20:59.775 --> 21:02.377
concern that we have today.

21:07.862 --> 21:13.607
Every youngster in high school, it'd be 
impossible for them to all go to to college or

21:13.958 --> 21:16.381
higher education. So we have some who cannot meet 
the entrance requirements. We have some who

21:19.264 --> 21:23.488
really don't have an interest in higher 
education. Now, what are these young people going

21:23.848 --> 21:25.550
to do? So we say that general education has to be 
strong, but that vocational education has a place

21:26.191 --> 21:43.189
in the public schools for those who have an 
interest in a livelihood that requires training

21:26.191 --> 21:43.189
less than a college degree. So what we're seeing 
here is that we feel like there's a need in the

21:44.502 --> 21:55.872
public schools to offer programs that train young 
people for entry-level world of work

21:44.502 --> 21:55.872
experiences.

22:00.236 --> 22:06.181
It's sort of like my homespun philosophy of what is 
vocational education. I jokingly tell folks at

22:07.863 --> 22:13.007
times, it is that training that helps keep people 
off the welfare road. If young people have a skill,

22:14.017 --> 22:21.064
then they can be productively employed. And I 
contend that everybody wants to be productively

22:21.244 --> 22:33.035
employed and not be on the welfare rolls or without 
employment or living on the family. So really I see

22:33.535 --> 22:42.083
general education and vocational education 
being very compatible, going down the railroad

22:33.535 --> 22:42.083
track side by side, If you push me which one is the 
most important, certainly I'm going to have to say

22:43.278 --> 22:49.444
general education. In my own personal 
philosophy, there's not enough money to pay the

22:49.464 --> 22:58.032
salary of a good first grade teacher and a second 
grade. That's where it all starts. Personally, I

23:00.975 --> 23:04.998
have some philosophies with kindergarten, 
pre-kindergarten.

23:08.382 --> 23:11.985
You know, I just think that there's a time when 
young people need to be Babies, sometimes we don't

23:12.404 --> 23:18.530
let them be babies long enough. I have a daughter 
who is a school teacher who gave me my third

23:19.591 --> 23:24.836
grandchild this past Friday afternoon. And 
economic conditions, the way they are, as soon as

23:25.717 --> 23:31.322
she possibly can, she'll have to go back to the 
classroom. So my grandson is going to have to be put

23:32.023 --> 23:37.067
under somebody else's care, against my wishes. 
But that's the way the economic and social

23:37.127 --> 23:41.972
structure seems to work today. Okay, what about 
any insights or observations or even an anecdote

23:43.285 --> 23:55.984
or so that might stand out in your mind over this 
long standing career that you lead? Oh, I've had

23:56.004 --> 23:58.068
lots of good things to happen.

24:01.533 --> 24:04.838
In this department, we take great pride in that

24:07.720 --> 24:13.528
All of our people have received the Distinguished 
Service Award in Teaching by the Informal

24:07.720 --> 24:13.528
Students Association. So these are some of the 
things that we strive for. It's sort of a personal

24:18.394 --> 24:19.756
goal. But to me, that indicates a level of 
excellence in teaching, especially when young

24:20.497 --> 24:30.591
people say, hey, you're good enough for this type 
of award. Our young people, we have one faculty

24:32.213 --> 24:35.938
member who will be In December, become the 
president of all the teacher educators in

24:37.235 --> 24:46.548
agriculture in the United States for 1987-88. Who 
is that? That's Dr. Don Herring.

24:55.040 --> 25:03.833
We have another young faculty member who is a 
member of the Young Astronaut Program in

24:55.040 --> 25:03.833
Agriculture, Dr. Joe Townsend. And he spends time 
in Florida with that group and will be going down in

25:04.370 --> 25:09.474
December. And that has to do with the coordination 
of science and agriculture in the space program.

25:15.199 --> 25:17.041
We'd like to be on the cutting edge here. Someday we 
will, agriculture will be as much of an outer space

25:18.983 --> 25:26.069
as it is here in this country. Maybe not in our 
lifetime, but we're starting on that. So we have

25:35.993 --> 25:40.178
lots of good things going for us along those lines.

25:43.703 --> 25:49.990
There was a time when the pendulum was way over on 
the vocational and agriculture and all. And then

25:50.331 --> 25:52.694
it keeps going back and forth, though, right? I 
mean, right now, would you say it's swung the other

25:52.814 --> 25:59.402
direction by your comment about the negative 
attitude towards... not only agriculture, but

26:00.007 --> 26:05.015
vocational in general, isn't it, with this parole 
thing? Has that had a real, really great impact on

26:07.119 --> 26:10.925
Attitude? Well, first of all, a lot of people 
condemn Ross Perot for his involvement in the

26:17.185 --> 26:21.770
educational process. I am not that critical of 
Ross Perot because we had changes in agriculture

26:22.010 --> 26:34.063
that needed to be made that we could not make for the 
simple reason we had a clientele of teachers who

26:22.010 --> 26:34.063
would not accept it. So we needed somebody strong 
and forceful like Ross Perot to come in and mandate

26:34.603 --> 26:40.930
some changes. Can you specify a couple of those 
changes? Those changes in which we will do away

26:43.021 --> 27:00.797
with the traditional production one, two, three, 
and four of agriculture, of teaching shows and

26:43.021 --> 27:00.797
contests, of getting away from the production 
aspect of cows, plows, and sows, and get into some

26:43.021 --> 27:00.797
semester courses. And this department and this 
faculty, on a faculty retreat about a year ago, we

27:01.637 --> 27:11.526
developed 23 semester-length courses that is 
being implemented across the state. And due to the

27:12.265 --> 27:24.016
diversity of agriculture in the state, the 
teachers and the community can select courses

27:12.265 --> 27:24.016
that's applicable to them. For example,

27:24.036 --> 27:37.309
the folks in the Rio Grande Valley, they've got a 
specialty type of agriculture in citrus that

27:24.036 --> 27:37.309
students in Amarillo just don't have a need to 
know. Now, we're not talking about basics and

27:38.270 --> 27:41.833
fundamentals and principles. But we have 
generally broken this into areas such as the

27:42.269 --> 28:03.482
horticultural sciences,

27:42.269 --> 28:03.482
the agribusiness, the ag mechanics, the 
environment, and these things can be applicable.

28:03.582 --> 28:06.066
For example, I can see a need in the Houston area for 
somebody to get involved in the raising of

28:07.075 --> 28:13.442
research animals. Rats, guinea pigs, hamsters. 
Hey, that's agriculture.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.853
But that might not be true at SNCC. For example, the 
only area where primate animals are raised is in

28:23.873 --> 28:30.180
San Antonio. I'm not saying that we're going to get 
involved in raising monkeys and so forth as a big

28:31.257 --> 28:41.976
agricultural enterprise, but I think we have 
become so highly specialized that we can no longer

28:42.513 --> 28:46.117
cover the waterfront in our teaching. So that's a 
big change. So House Bill 72 and 246, we've even

28:47.839 --> 28:54.527
been impacted by Senate Bill 994. Now we're able to 
keep our name, agricultural education. And we

28:59.673 --> 29:02.957
don't have to go the interdisciplinary route like 
some of the others. We appeared two weeks ago

29:03.077 --> 29:07.002
before the advisory committee, coordinating 
board in five minutes time we pleaded our case and

29:07.268 --> 29:35.588
look we've got 48 hours of agriculture we only have 
24 going to 18 hours of education it takes 12 hours

29:07.268 --> 29:35.588
in your major to get a degree from an institution 
they said fine good you don't belong under this

29:07.268 --> 29:35.588
umbrella here of senate bill 994 which we feel good 
about so those are just some of the impacts and in

29:07.268 --> 29:35.588
closing do you have any words of wisdom Well, I 
never did have much wisdom, but I think one of the

29:36.293 --> 29:49.405
biggest problems that we're running into, I 
think, at this time, in addition to all these

29:36.293 --> 29:49.405
things that we have discussed, the paperwork has 
become horrendous. And I'm sure this is in all

29:50.366 --> 29:53.049
facets of society. And so much of our work today is 
involved in what I have referred to here, that we

29:54.070 --> 30:05.220
are involved in too many non-teacher education 
functions. And I think whenever that happens,

30:06.652 --> 30:21.374
this takes away from the close relationship and 
working and concentration on the improvement of

30:06.652 --> 30:21.374
the individual who will be going into the 
classroom at some point in time. So I am hopeful

30:22.095 --> 30:33.672
that in the years to come that we can devote more 
time to working with the certification program.

30:34.242 --> 30:39.868
try to better prepare young people for the 
classroom. Again, we're at odds on some of these

30:40.108 --> 30:42.430
things. We have one half semester of student 
teaching, or nine weeks. And we have a number of

30:46.774 --> 30:52.000
folks who are advocating a whole year of student 
teaching. And we have asked for research. There is

30:54.902 --> 30:56.124
no research. And we talk about research-based 
competencies. There is no research. That tells us

30:59.977 --> 31:08.226
that one full year or even one semester of student 
teaching is better than a half a semester. Now, a

31:08.246 --> 31:23.723
concern that we really have in this department is 
that we've got the pre-student teaching work in

31:08.246 --> 31:23.723
the schools, we've got student teaching, and then 
we've got a year of, a proposed year of internship

31:08.246 --> 31:23.723
in those schools. Now, it's well and good for us to 
be working with these individuals, but what about

31:24.260 --> 31:41.660
the poor student that's in school trying to get 
through the elementary and high school when he or

31:24.260 --> 31:41.660
she is subjected to student teachers or bombarded 
by student teachers or observers every day of the

31:24.260 --> 31:41.660
week? I think that no one has really addressed this 
problem.
