WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:16.539
to see Mrs. Johnson, and she asked for my grade records again, and they were pretty good, both the first two quarters, and so she said, all right.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.443
She gave me a slip.

00:20.164 --> 00:25.212
She said, you report over to Dr. Mickle, the head of entomology.

00:26.390 --> 00:28.812
and he'll assign you a job.

00:28.832 --> 00:36.820
She looked through her records about where the request for student help, excuse me.

00:36.840 --> 00:46.050
I went over to see Dr. Mikkel, and there's interesting small world bits that come up in this too.

00:47.331 --> 00:53.477
And he put me to working up in the insect museum.

00:54.301 --> 00:56.364
cutting labels and pinning up insects.

00:57.005 --> 01:12.108
And I was assigned mostly to work for graduate student Clarence Hoffman, who was working on, I can even remember the name of the insect, Neodyprion bank siena, which is a sawfly of jack pine.

01:14.092 --> 01:17.056
She was doing a dissertation on that?

01:17.076 --> 01:21.523
Yes, and he was getting fairly well along towards

01:22.482 --> 01:25.765
towards finishing his doctor.

01:25.785 --> 01:51.612
So, I worked with him that spring semester, and there was another young student in the same shape as I, but he was an undergraduate in animology, Richard Dagge, whom I met in the most unlikely place about

01:52.165 --> 02:08.161
I suppose 35 years later, over in the Mediterranean, I guess I was in, it wasn't Rhodes, Muscatinian Cyprus.

02:09.402 --> 02:21.514
I was looking at their wheat problems, their germ wheat, and I came in one Saturday afternoon into the hotel and it was hot and I went in to get a Coca-Cola, turned into the

02:21.798 --> 02:37.343
little bar and I nearly ran into this same man, Richard Dagey, who was then the director of the largest hospital, I suppose the only big one, in Saudi Arabia.

02:38.224 --> 02:45.696
He had finished entomology, went through during this period, then took

02:46.452 --> 03:05.516
medical entomology in graduate school, public health degree at John Hopkins or MIT, I'm not sure which, and he had ended up on mosquito and malaria control over there, and so here was the small world that shrunk and I ran into him.

03:07.899 --> 03:14.147
This must have been in about 1960.

03:15.190 --> 03:19.033
A lot of water had gone under the bridge.

03:20.595 --> 03:23.918
But when we turned the corner, I called him by name.

03:23.978 --> 03:30.264
I had never seen him since he was 35 or 37, maybe.

03:30.424 --> 03:32.326
And he called me by name.

03:32.606 --> 03:33.306
It was curious.

03:33.567 --> 03:38.451
I guess we suffered next to each other long enough so that we learned to know each other well.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.835
There's another sequel to this.

03:45.110 --> 03:46.512
Well, I'm getting too far.

03:46.532 --> 03:48.836
Shall I tie this one in?

03:49.296 --> 04:12.552
Clarence Hoffman, the next time I saw him, when I got all tangled up into this environmental issue business on DDT and malaria and all of the other diseases that are of tremendous importance in tropical countries, this must have been in 19...

04:13.949 --> 04:18.676
Because right after, when I was getting ready to, I was preparing the McDougal lecture.

04:18.816 --> 04:20.138
I don't know if you've ever seen this.

04:22.261 --> 04:23.603
It got to be a hot issue.

04:24.925 --> 04:32.677
This is a memorial lecture that's given at each opening of the Food and Agriculture Organization sessions.

04:32.697 --> 04:39.687
And in 1971, I was invited to give this.

04:41.118 --> 04:43.240
And so I was digging up data.

04:43.481 --> 04:49.067
I wanted to see Dr. Nippling, who was the head of entomology at the USDA.

04:50.329 --> 04:54.373
And I had the appointment at Palsdale to see him.

04:54.934 --> 04:58.017
And I arrived, I guess I arrived a little earlier, he was held up.

04:59.059 --> 05:10.011
And so the secretary ushered me in to see his deputy, and I could see his name written on his plaque on his desk.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.836
Clarence Hoffman.

05:14.856 --> 05:23.647
And so I took a stuck a needle and I said, how are the Neodiprian panxianus getting along?

05:25.429 --> 05:28.573
He hadn't worked, of course, in forest entomology for a long time.

05:28.614 --> 05:40.909
He'd gone into more general entomology and he sort of looked in a bewildered way as to what in the devil was this guy asking such a ridiculous question about.

05:41.817 --> 05:53.670
Finally I said, you don't remember me, but I was an undergraduate that pinned up most of your insect collection back in 1934.

05:57.034 --> 06:05.884
Well, going back to the NYA, then the second year I guess I

06:07.585 --> 06:20.751
I worked in entomology also, but for another professor, Alex Hodson, and he was working on defoliation studies and the effect of defoliation on tree long survival.

06:21.052 --> 06:35.307
mostly forest tent caterpillar, but he had lots of data with different degrees of defoliation and some artificially defoliated by hand that we did to give effects over several years time, much later.

06:35.987 --> 06:41.293
So I worked with him, helped him on these data.

06:41.853 --> 06:44.856
He later became the head of the Department of Entomology there.

06:44.876 --> 06:50.502
He's retired four or five years ago, Alex Hodson.

06:50.870 --> 07:18.075
The third year, I worked down in veterinary medicine for Dr. Boyd, took care of the guinea pigs, all the experimental animals, and I guess the fourth year I didn't have to work because by then I was, I had dropped out and worked for

07:18.612 --> 07:24.687
service and had a little money and so I could survive without that.

07:24.707 --> 07:28.597
And maybe even NYA was being discontinued by then, I don't remember.

07:30.201 --> 07:35.895
Did you perceive NYA as, you know this is, the new deal was the first time and

07:36.297 --> 07:42.984
in which the government is directly a number of people in a society.

07:44.246 --> 07:53.116
Did you perceive this as a government handout, which is some of the criticism at the time, or make work projects?

07:53.436 --> 08:03.587
Or did you feel that you were working for the University of Minnesota more than for the government in a responsible fashion?

08:03.922 --> 08:15.742
Yes, I do because of the fact that these programs that we were working on were related to the research programs that the professors were carrying on.

08:15.782 --> 08:18.506
They weren't something else that were added.

08:18.907 --> 08:27.381
I think what in effect happened was that by getting student aid like this they could carry more research and probably do a

08:27.361 --> 08:28.743
better job of it.

08:28.763 --> 08:38.796
I never felt that this was just a handout, nor did I feel that way about the Civilian Conservation Corps, you see.

08:38.816 --> 08:39.698
Which we're going to get to.

08:40.579 --> 08:43.843
Because they had similar aspects, and the WPA.

08:44.484 --> 08:48.710
Yeah, okay.

08:49.351 --> 08:56.440
This is sort of a forerunner for like work-study program that we have on campus today.

08:56.605 --> 08:58.347
which is an LBJ program.

09:05.595 --> 09:14.885
Did you, because you were in this type of a program back in the 1930s, since that time, have you supported government aid to students?

09:14.905 --> 09:16.506
Yes.

09:16.526 --> 09:26.477
Of course, I've been far removed from being outside the country, but basically, I think it's a good investment for the future.

09:29.461 --> 09:36.709
And I think that this was well handled back in the 30s.

09:37.069 --> 09:38.991
I would assume that it still is today.

09:39.451 --> 09:44.597
I mean, you have to keep a certain academic record or you're out.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.860
That's still the way it is, I assume, right?

09:48.261 --> 09:55.468
You have to keep a certain level of academic excellence or you lose your system.

09:57.102 --> 10:26.316
The CCC came along, and in the summer of my, let's see, sophomore year, must have been 35, I had a chance to, I wrote 50 or more letters to all the regional offices of the Forest Service and to the forest experiment stations all over the country.

10:27.308 --> 10:39.973
I was one of the few undergraduates, because it was the number that went out, that got a summer job in 35, at least a sophomore.

10:40.053 --> 10:47.427
That was very rare, juniors and seniors, yes, but I had a chance to go to the

10:48.436 --> 10:50.699
Northeastern Forest Experiment Station.

10:51.159 --> 10:54.283
The headquarters at that time were in New Haven, Connecticut.

10:54.303 --> 10:57.988
Since then they've been two regions put together and they're in Philadelphia.

10:59.350 --> 11:06.539
And I was sent to the Hopkins Experimental Forest, which was being organized.

11:06.639 --> 11:11.906
This was land that was taken over, given, I suppose, to the government.

11:12.707 --> 11:17.633
It was part of the old hill, the railroad magnate's estate.

11:17.950 --> 11:22.015
Tremendous old buildings in the foot of the Berkshire.

11:22.075 --> 11:25.600
Well, it's right near Mount Greylock, just on the edge of Williamstown.

11:26.321 --> 11:36.594
Today, this is the environmental and botanical garden, I guess they call it, of Williams College.

11:37.235 --> 11:42.422
I've forgotten the exact title, but anyway, about 10 or 12 years ago,

11:43.195 --> 11:53.671
This property was passed over, it was closed out as a forest experiment station that became a part of the biology department of Williams College.

11:54.072 --> 12:11.599
Well, I ran the boundary survey on this, took the forest inventory plots and laid out the plots where Dr. Ernie Schreiner was beginning his rather big program

12:12.322 --> 12:19.310
on genetic improvement of asthma, poplar.

12:19.330 --> 12:20.291
Really?

12:20.972 --> 12:26.138
Is this the first time that you've dealt with any issues dealing with genetics?

12:26.418 --> 12:26.658
Yes.

12:26.919 --> 12:29.982
And is this what was one of the main stimulants?

12:30.503 --> 12:33.666
Well, he was just getting going on this.

12:34.267 --> 12:40.354
There's some interesting things there also, how small the world is.

12:42.224 --> 12:46.148
and how many cross ties I learned from these early experiences.

12:50.573 --> 13:10.775
While I was there, and had this pretty well along all the mapping, it was a detailed map, both vegetation and border lines, the old topographic map, and I guess I was about three quarters done.

13:11.777 --> 13:12.197
I stayed

13:12.515 --> 13:17.201
I not only worked that summer, I stayed out of school, so I'd get a little money together.

13:17.481 --> 13:23.768
I lived right there on the station with all kinds of houses.

13:23.888 --> 13:29.335
They weren't fixed up, old ones, cold and miserable, but livable.

13:29.996 --> 13:32.759
So I lived there with the family.

13:32.779 --> 13:42.150
I ate with my boss, who was a civil engineer, was directly in charge of this, but he was not a forester, but he had been named interim

13:42.383 --> 13:49.910
manager, Bart, not Bart, Boxstar.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.031
That was the nickname.

13:51.051 --> 13:54.594
I don't even remember his true name.

13:54.614 --> 14:01.300
Anyway, he was a civil engineer, and so he left most of the forestry work to me.

14:01.881 --> 14:11.209
One day I got a wire saying from the New Haven office, we're sending up another man to join your crew.

14:13.062 --> 14:17.389
He's Merlin B. Dickerman.

14:17.409 --> 14:23.919
He just got his master's degree from University of California, Forest Economics.

14:23.939 --> 14:27.004
God, I thought, now here I am, a sophomore.

14:27.024 --> 14:30.350
I'm gonna have this guy on my crew and I'll really have trouble.

14:32.713 --> 14:40.065
But it turned out that he was a wonderful guy and we established friendship and all down through the years he became the

14:40.703 --> 14:51.072
deputy chief of the Forest Service eventually before he retired about four years ago and in charge of research.

14:51.533 --> 14:53.494
We maintained contact all of that time.

14:53.554 --> 15:08.668
He later moved as a director of research or director of the Rocky Mountain, Northern Rocky Mountain Forest Experiment Station and then subsequently to the Lake State.

15:09.087 --> 15:23.282
Forest Experiment Station on the campus of Minnesota, and then up to the deputy chief, and there too was a funny lingering tide that had importance.

15:24.443 --> 15:38.638
He came down to Mexico on a committee meeting in 19, oh I guess, 1968 or so.

15:39.327 --> 15:43.112
But meanwhile, we'd been in contact all along, all over the years.

15:43.212 --> 15:51.764
As a matter of fact, he tried to convince me to leave wheat breeding and become a forest tree breeder a couple of times.

15:52.245 --> 15:57.292
And I was inclined, but never made the shift.

15:58.373 --> 16:08.828
But as a result of this, we used to talk about these things, and he'd invite me sometimes to the forest genetics meetings, EUFRO, which is the United EU,

16:09.044 --> 16:19.299
Anyways, the International Union of Forest Tree Breeders.

16:20.440 --> 16:37.785
First time I went, this is interesting too, first time I went was at Penn State, maybe in 64 or 5, and I was talking about the

16:38.221 --> 16:49.935
incorporating and breeding and maintaining disease resistance in important crop species or forest trees.

16:49.955 --> 17:08.177
And as I was introduced, the Chancellor at Penn State, who was an undergraduate classmate, started out in forestry in Minnesota, but then had changed to horticulture.

17:09.001 --> 17:21.617
He introduced me, I'll come up with his name in a second, Larson, Russ Larson, but he didn't mention that I was a forester, really.

17:21.637 --> 17:28.967
By then I had gained a certain amount of notoriety in wheat, so this never came out in the introduction.

17:29.757 --> 17:38.627
So as I stepped up to the podium, I looked around and I see Ernie Schreiner down here, the guy that I used to, I laid out his first plots for.

17:39.408 --> 17:47.497
And I saw Carl Hartley, who was the chief forest pathologist for the USDA, for the Forest Service.

17:47.637 --> 17:49.920
They're sitting together right down in front.

17:51.521 --> 17:56.507
And so I started out my comments and I said, you know,

17:57.230 --> 17:58.294
It's kind of frightening.

17:58.494 --> 18:06.582
I've been away from forestry so long that even my two former chiefs don't recognize

18:07.540 --> 18:28.241
Ernie, I was the same person that laid out your first plots for your forest genetics, your aspen breeding plots, and Carl, I used to talk to you about the disasters of losing our American chestnut, the chestnut blight, and here you don't even recognize me.

18:29.482 --> 18:32.385
Schreiner is a sort of an emotional person.

18:32.405 --> 18:33.987
He jumped up in the

18:34.490 --> 18:37.974
front of this auditorium and he says, damn you, Norm.

18:37.994 --> 18:40.957
He says, I thought that was an entirely different name.

18:41.017 --> 18:44.081
I'd seen it, Borlaug, but it never rang a bell.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.225
So that's how small the world is.

18:48.245 --> 19:00.919
Going back the other way about Dickerman, when he came down to Mexico, he was serving on a joint Canadian-Mexican-USA for planning of some international force to

19:01.709 --> 19:03.231
foresters meeting.

19:03.852 --> 19:04.774
This was in 68.

19:07.599 --> 19:17.475
And so I loaned them an office car to make some trips around and have a look at some forestry thing.

19:17.575 --> 19:19.197
I was tied up so that I couldn't go.

19:20.279 --> 19:26.890
When he came back, he spent two days out at our research center and he said, look,

19:27.140 --> 19:49.924
He said, I see all of these young people around here that you're training from all over the world in genetics, plant breeding, in agronomy, which would be like silviculture to us, in all of the interrelated disciplines, forest pathology or plant pathology and entomology, and we don't have any practical courses like this, he said.

19:50.444 --> 19:56.172
Our people are very theoretical when it comes to forest genetics.

19:56.573 --> 20:09.251
They learn it from a book and have a little time with a professor who's carrying on a very modest program, but do you think that we could work out something that might be useful?

20:09.592 --> 20:11.915
I said, well, I don't know.

20:12.977 --> 20:18.004
So we talked about it and now I guess we've had five of those

20:19.132 --> 20:19.612
meetings.

20:20.053 --> 20:45.797
The way it worked out was that at no expense to CIMA International Mason Wheat Center, it was agreed by the directors of CIMA and the Forest Service originally that we could accept up to five, I guess at one time it went up to six or seven, five young forest geneticists

20:45.980 --> 20:50.288
forest breeders, call them what you will, or forest pathologists interested in breeding.

20:52.472 --> 21:00.607
They would pay their own expense, live in our quarters, travel with our people for a month.

21:01.328 --> 21:07.920
They would spend, and I laid out how I thought it should be, three weeks of that.

21:08.373 --> 21:18.468
period, with the corn program, because we were using a recurrent selection type of breeding program, which is precisely what you have to use in forestry.

21:20.171 --> 21:27.842
In the last week, they would spend it with our wheat and barley and triticale program, where it's just the opposite.

21:27.923 --> 21:29.846
It's self-pollinated crop plants.

21:30.426 --> 21:36.135
They're vulnerable to diseases more than the forest trees, although both have problems.

21:36.757 --> 21:41.062
And then we would have one day where we'd bring in all our senior staff.

21:41.863 --> 21:53.757
They would present in the morning a brief synopsis of their program that they were doing back home in the U.S.

21:53.777 --> 21:54.438
forestry.

21:55.379 --> 21:59.043
And we would have questions and answers.

21:59.063 --> 22:06.612
And it turned out to be a wonderful program because of the fact, you see, I used to chair those in the early times.

22:07.368 --> 22:26.327
I would say after they'd made their presentations, I would say to our head wheat breeder who never thought about trees, I said, Raja, Raja Ram, we have tough time keeping rust resistance in our varieties for five at the most ten years.

22:27.208 --> 22:36.497
Now, these people are confronted with the problem of incorporating, let's say, rust resistance into this pine species

22:37.473 --> 22:42.400
that will not be harvested for 50 to 60 years, maybe 80.

22:43.121 --> 22:47.547
How would you approach that if you were given that job?

22:47.567 --> 22:56.740
Their eyes bug out, you know, because they've been thinking in short terms and annual crops, and you can go through a generation, two generations a year.

22:57.882 --> 23:02.348
You can't do this in forest trees, so you've got to rethink your whole thing.

23:02.829 --> 23:04.932
On the other hand, the foresters,

23:06.025 --> 23:27.759
when they'd see the shortcuts that were being taken and the close linkage between our, let's say, breeding for maize or corn quality, nutritive quality, between our biochemistry laboratory and the geneticists out in our plots, they got insights into lots of things that they would never have had before.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.502
To make a long story short,

23:30.055 --> 23:32.638
We've had these every second year.

23:33.118 --> 23:37.002
I guess we've had five of those up to now.

23:37.022 --> 23:44.069
Yes, it's been expanded a bit in that last time we had Canadian.

23:45.791 --> 23:56.822
There's a growing demand for this, but we can't do this if we bring too many then to become a burden to our own corn breeders, our own wheat breeders, but it's a good

23:57.697 --> 24:26.674
mix so you see way back in that forestry thing there's some funny things that have happened and how they're all tied up i think for good yeah for not one country but for many countries now let's get back to cccs and let's get back to your to the experiments that you did what what were you doing uh on that plot the forest and and what were your aims and what were your accomplishments well at that time i was not

24:26.890 --> 24:29.234
nothing more than a technician.

24:30.335 --> 24:53.151
I was a young forester who was, as I said, mapped this, made an inventory of all the vegetation, picked out the areas where we thought the plots should be located, staked them out, and that was about where it was when I left to go back to school.

24:53.806 --> 25:03.296
Shriner came down a couple of times and talked about where these should go and the general planning, but I never was directly involved in this.

25:03.537 --> 25:09.923
This was probably your first time working in the field, wasn't it?

25:10.484 --> 25:12.326
In forestry, yes.

25:12.566 --> 25:20.875
And being your first time, did it confirm your interest in forestry or did it raise doubts that you wanted to be a forester?

25:21.316 --> 25:23.458
No, it intrigued me greatly.

25:24.063 --> 25:51.201
and I think probably one of the things that left the greatest impact on me was that in that area the chestnut were dying, I would say that most of them were already dead, and this was a disaster, you see all of these beautiful old dried trees, they don't rot and fall down because it was very resistant to decay, and

25:52.514 --> 26:03.450
I'd gotten interested in the disease and had done some reading about this and I guess I'd, maybe I'd taken a course in forest pathology.

26:04.552 --> 26:14.126
I don't think, I don't think I'd taken it yet, but at least I'd done some reading and this disturbed me no end.

26:14.547 --> 26:16.750
Why we weren't spending more effort

26:18.535 --> 26:19.677
more money on.

26:19.697 --> 26:24.164
Here is a disease wiping out a complete species.

26:24.184 --> 26:33.839
It so happens that today I'm indirectly involved with Dave French, who's the head of this and the head of plant pathology at Minnesota.

26:33.899 --> 26:35.582
He was trained in forest pathology.

26:36.575 --> 26:55.562
and he and Charlie Burnham who was the cytogeneticist on corn until he retired about 10 years ago, they started the Little Chestnut Foundation and there's a couple of nurserymen in southern Minnesota that joined into this and now nearly a

26:55.778 --> 27:11.219
80 years after the problem should have been attacked, we're going at this thing again, and I'm indirectly involved, I don't have time to do much, but the person that I was talking to a minute ago is interested in this also.

27:11.459 --> 27:15.525
Warehouse is getting a little interested, but you see,

27:18.425 --> 27:28.695
This kind of thing always has bugged me and worried me about how we don't spend money wisely.

27:28.736 --> 27:35.863
We don't start programs that are obviously needed soon enough.

27:35.883 --> 27:38.145
We wait until the disaster is well advanced.

27:38.505 --> 27:41.729
Chestnut or chestnut blight was not the only one.

27:42.750 --> 27:46.694
That's young diseases exhibit A and today.

27:46.734 --> 27:47.875
Same mistakes.

27:48.648 --> 27:58.078
Is that because of human behavior or is it because of our free market economy or is it because the way our government works?

27:59.199 --> 28:01.181
Why do you think that is?

28:01.201 --> 28:12.293
Well I suppose in forestry it's much more difficult because you have to have continuity of funding for breeding forestries for at least 20 years.

28:13.370 --> 28:26.551
Whereas in breeding a rust-resistant or disease-resistant variety of wheat, you can get this done with the techniques that we were instrumental in working with two generations a year or three.

28:27.152 --> 28:32.780
You can get a concrete positive impact in five years.

28:34.303 --> 28:36.787
But in trees... Which is nice for a funding organization.

28:37.367 --> 28:40.352
That's right, for a funding standpoint.

28:40.372 --> 28:41.554
But the Congress...

28:42.108 --> 28:44.951
looked at these appropriations every couple of years.

28:45.331 --> 28:51.979
You know how that goes on the forestry thing, and forestry is under the eight ball because of that.

28:52.539 --> 29:01.409
And then in recent years, I'm sorry I'm wandering off here, but I think there's some pertinent principles involved.

29:03.371 --> 29:11.760
The Forest Service or administrators of public lands, I think the state Forest Services are probably in the same situation.

29:12.770 --> 29:16.955
with all of the environmentalist movement.

29:16.975 --> 29:28.109
There are certain extremists who are involved, and they may not be the majority by any means, but they're heard.

29:29.171 --> 29:38.102
They're heard in the popular press, television, and radio, and they exert a disproportionate influence to the number that they are.

29:38.977 --> 29:45.205
issues that to me are important to management of our forest over the long pull.

29:46.066 --> 30:07.633
The result was that, I guess it was in 1975, when I was invited to attend forest genetics meeting, that time it happened to be in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, this international meeting, UFRA, Union of

30:08.609 --> 30:34.449
international forest tree breeders or whatever it is, and following this meeting, and it was an excellent meeting, I got loud out of it, I was a closing speaker, and again here's where you'll get a payoff across different crops and disciplines.

30:34.469 --> 30:36.152
For the first, this was where

30:37.162 --> 30:47.796
There was a lot of work being reported on breeding for blister rust, soft pines.

30:49.217 --> 30:51.680
Is this what we have up in Yellowstone?

30:52.642 --> 30:56.346
Yes, on the soft pines it's all through the west.

30:57.228 --> 30:59.170
And it turns them brown?

30:59.875 --> 31:03.866
It kills them gradually over time, the susceptible ones.

31:03.886 --> 31:10.164
And this was something that had always fascinated me because this was an introduced disease also.

31:10.264 --> 31:14.155
You see, the chestnut blight was introduced from Asia.

31:14.607 --> 31:28.508
there are recessing chestnuts in Asia and had we gone about it right and crossed them and recrossed them, selected them, we'd have a tree that looked like the American chestnut resistant.

31:28.528 --> 31:29.830
We didn't do it.

31:29.850 --> 31:33.275
The same story on Dutch Young disease.

31:33.295 --> 31:43.450
The resistance is always, there's co-evolution of the pathogen and the host in the zones of origin, but apparently both the chestnut

31:43.919 --> 31:51.571
American chestnut and American elm evolved on the American continent away from contact with this passenger.

31:52.071 --> 31:53.894
They had never seen it before.

31:53.914 --> 31:56.899
And when it came in, rubbed them all out.

31:57.520 --> 31:58.942
They were all susceptible.

31:58.962 --> 32:01.145
There's no exception.

32:01.165 --> 32:05.792
But in the case of white pine, over a period of

32:06.768 --> 32:13.642
Twenty years before this meeting, that was in 68, I believe, that I was at Gord Lane.

32:14.664 --> 32:27.730
Dick Bingham, who was a forest geneticist out in Moscow, Idaho, got interested in this problem, and it had been worked on at the University of Wisconsin and several other places.

32:28.503 --> 32:32.928
But the problem, the disease is much worse in the Inland Empire.

32:32.948 --> 32:44.860
Western white pine, especially in those areas where you have a lot of fog and high humidity, the best stands of western white pine were demolished.

32:45.281 --> 32:53.169
But Dick Pingham would see an occasional tree, I've forgotten what it was, one in 20,000 or some such thing, that didn't die.

32:53.410 --> 32:56.653
Some of them were more resistant of those that didn't die.

32:56.633 --> 33:00.958
than others, and he collected these and he started making a few crosses.

33:00.978 --> 33:20.683
This was 20 or more years before that 68, and so he had demonstrated that some of these were highly promising, and he was reporting on this, and then there were, during those days, there were a lot of short papers that were being presented.

33:21.457 --> 33:35.132
And one after another, young forest pathologist would get up and say, I have found a gene for resistance in pinus flexless, limber pine, high elevation pine, soft pine.

33:35.913 --> 33:40.378
Somebody else, I've found a gene for resistance in sugar pine.

33:41.599 --> 33:46.384
And one of the other western soft pines

33:46.837 --> 33:51.325
not of economic importance, but these were being reported.

33:53.007 --> 34:11.899
And of course, previously out in Wisconsin they had been working on this rust, and they had reported resistance in northern white pine, one that we have out in the Midwest and out in New England, where the disease isn't so severe.

34:12.841 --> 34:33.043
And as I listened to this and they were discussing, I was supposed to be the speaker on Friday, by about late Tuesday afternoon I couldn't, I couldn't detain myself any longer and I said, pardon me for interrupting but I think this is a point that needs to be

34:34.357 --> 34:45.193
discussed at this point, and all of the data has recently been presented, or three days from now we won't get the right focus on it.

34:45.213 --> 34:59.173
And I said, you are dealing with fossil genes, but they're fossil only in the sense of their oldness in the genus Pinus, the soft pines of North America.

35:02.037 --> 35:03.199
What this means to me

35:05.221 --> 35:13.189
I surmise from my knowledge of what happened with corn rust in Africa.

35:14.891 --> 35:24.982
Corn was introduced into West Africa, probably on empty slave ships going back in the 1500s.

35:25.002 --> 35:31.549
They took corn back and it became a basic subsistence crop.

35:33.757 --> 35:44.433
The earliest records indicates that corn rust was present there early, but it was not of any importance.

35:45.815 --> 35:54.989
But in 1948, or thereabouts, there was a disastrous explosion of corn rust and famine.

35:56.331 --> 36:02.059
And by then, this was after the war, they started bringing in foreign experts,

36:02.613 --> 36:23.864
and testing materials, they found lots of resistance from Mexico, the Caribbean area, and the new corns that were introduced, but they didn't fit from the standpoint of productivity when they started crossing, but before they could get a new variety out, that little peasant farmer, he solved the problem.

36:26.748 --> 36:27.169
He had

36:27.993 --> 36:37.926
And these scientists found that, I should have pointed out, that there are two corn rusts in the zones of origin of corn, Mexico, for example.

36:37.946 --> 36:47.379
At the lower elevation, there's one that the repeating spores are sort of quadrangular.

36:47.399 --> 36:54.688
And the one at higher elevation, lower temperature organism, is like an American football, readily distinguishable.

36:54.708 --> 36:55.790
Pustules look the same.

36:56.070 --> 36:57.392
The spores look different.

36:58.739 --> 37:08.129
And the rust that they found in the old herbaria were all of that high temperature or high elevation, low temperature.

37:08.589 --> 37:10.031
And so it never became a problem.

37:10.511 --> 37:16.638
The one that blew up was the one that fit that hot climate.

37:16.658 --> 37:18.380
And it came from the low elevations.

37:19.341 --> 37:24.366
And almost certainly had been introduced on roasting years or something like this.

37:24.466 --> 37:27.970
Maybe, who knows, out of an airplane in a dump.

37:28.591 --> 37:32.515
in a way, exploded, demolished everything.

37:33.135 --> 37:41.243
But that little person, farmer, he apparently had saved the best few years that weren't completely destroyed and replanted them.

37:41.263 --> 37:44.526
After he did this a couple of times, it was resistant.

37:44.546 --> 37:45.427
And I knew about this.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.669
The foresters didn't know about this.

37:48.430 --> 37:51.193
So I said, you're dealing with fossil genes.

37:52.294 --> 37:55.797
Fossil, not in the sense that they're not functional,

37:56.941 --> 38:03.188
These genes are at a low frequency in these American pine populations.

38:04.430 --> 38:12.940
The resistance, just as in the case of chestnut light, the case of Dutch elm disease, is in Asia.

38:13.741 --> 38:24.754
Eastern Asian pines are known to be resistant to a blister rust, Brunarchium ribiculum, Pinus seboricus,

38:25.628 --> 38:55.298
there's a whole series, and I said some time or other during one of the ice ages, and this has happened three or four times, when the ice was piled high on the continents and the Beringa Bridge was up, which covers three or four hundred miles in width and connected with Asia, there must have been pines growing all across these, and when these went down

38:55.885 --> 39:07.475
our pine end, this rust was also present in the populations of pine in the Americas, Alaska, British Columbia.

39:07.495 --> 39:08.856
What did the foresters say to this?

39:09.597 --> 39:12.079
They sat there like this.

39:13.921 --> 39:15.742
They thought I was crazy at the beginning.

39:16.003 --> 39:20.887
I'm sorry I'm taking so long, but it's interesting from a pure scientific standpoint.

39:20.907 --> 39:24.390
And so I said, the very fact that

39:25.653 --> 39:40.256
The genes for resistance are at a higher frequency here in Pinus manticula, and maybe in some of these species you've reported on today, than they are in northern white pine, eastern white pine.

39:40.276 --> 39:44.503
Indicates that this has been the gene flow.

39:45.384 --> 39:52.015
And when you don't have selection pressure of the disease on populations,

39:52.518 --> 40:03.222
then that gene is of no importance and so it'll be static and it'll probably, if it's connected to something that's related to survival, it'll be sloughed off negatively.

40:03.984 --> 40:07.713
But otherwise it'll just be floating.

40:07.733 --> 40:10.459
But here, it was killed off.

40:11.806 --> 40:13.429
by something in the ice age.

40:14.311 --> 40:23.468
The land bridge went down, we've got our pines, they've got theirs, the resistance is over there until Dick Bingham found it here and now you young people are reporting their genes here also.

40:25.272 --> 40:28.077
I say this is evidence that they were all connected.

40:28.799 --> 40:34.785
And those genes are part of that complex that are at a much higher frequency in Asia.

40:35.526 --> 40:38.890
And Dick Bingham, who is a good friend of mine, he says, crazy.

40:39.511 --> 40:44.156
And so then I explained to him about this corn thing that I explained first.

40:45.237 --> 40:46.518
But no one was convinced.

40:46.638 --> 40:51.844
The meeting, I gave the talk the last day, and I left to go back to Mexico.

40:51.884 --> 40:56.109
A month later, I got a note from him.

40:56.129 --> 40:57.490
He says, damn you, Norm.

40:58.803 --> 41:27.662
He said, you upset us, and we went back through all the literature, and we found a little note going back about seven or eight years ago in the Russian literature that they had found in the permafrost twigs and needles intact of a soft white pine that's probably indistinguishable from western white pine.

41:28.098 --> 41:30.982
and it's 50 miles in from tidewater.

41:32.725 --> 41:38.293
I mean, there's no proof, but it's pretty good circumstantial evidence that this is so.

41:38.974 --> 41:52.134
And so you see this forestry thing, it's a hobby for me now, but it's important because forests and land use, especially in irrigated agriculture, it's all related.

41:52.214 --> 41:55.118
And as a matter of fact, when I

41:55.705 --> 42:03.658
retired from the directorship of the Simic Wheat Program in 79 and my longtime associate Glenn Anderson took over.

42:03.678 --> 42:13.473
I had worked out arrangements where I was going to spend at least one month or six weeks a year working with Weyerhaeuser in their forest breeding program.

42:14.154 --> 42:16.578
It didn't work out very well after the first year.

42:16.598 --> 42:19.182
A little later,

42:19.516 --> 42:38.494
Dr. Anderson died like this after being sick for only five days, acute leukemia, and so I had to go back in the saddle again, so I've never had a chance to really work forestry again, but I still have that big interest.

42:38.514 --> 42:47.683
And the Forest Service, I mentioned New England, part of my work crew there were CCC boys.

42:48.136 --> 42:49.758
Let's talk about the CCC.

42:49.778 --> 42:57.505
And I lived in the CC camp part of the year, and at another time I had WPA crews.

42:57.585 --> 43:01.869
These were older men who were unemployed that worked on those forestry crews also.

43:02.469 --> 43:09.076
The CCC, I think, was one of the really good programs for that period.

43:09.096 --> 43:10.016
Did a lot of good.

43:10.897 --> 43:17.063
It salvaged young people from the slum areas that were poverty-stricken.

43:17.819 --> 43:45.767
I saw them change from demoralized youth when they came, this was out in New England mostly, mostly poor kids from the slums of Boston come in, and at that time, I don't know whether you're familiar with this or not, but the army ran the camps, barracks, just military barracks, oh is that right, and the mess.

43:46.473 --> 44:09.642
And we foresters or soil conservation, depending on what the program was, we would take the crews out at seven o'clock in the morning from the time they left camp until when they came back at five, they were under our control, the work program, whatever it was, planting trees, building trails, fire breaks, or whatnot.

44:10.423 --> 44:13.307
I was back in New England the second time.

44:16.072 --> 44:31.197
also under an emergency program where this was after the CC had shut down, but they picked it up after that, but the army wasn't involved then.

44:31.217 --> 44:36.105
It was right before we became embroiled in World War

44:37.874 --> 44:50.166
when there was a big hurricane that went through New England and blew down a tremendous lot of timber, and the Forest Service was assigned the job of helping the states to salvage that.

44:50.607 --> 44:57.513
They set up camps pretty much the same, but they were civilian-run, but the basic thing was similar.

44:57.533 --> 45:03.599
But the CCC was excellent because we lived and worked there with the military.

45:03.960 --> 45:07.223
We never had any, or at least I never had any friction.

45:08.148 --> 45:11.932
lived right next to the second lieutenants, mostly that ran the camp.

45:12.332 --> 45:16.156
Once in a while it was the first lieutenant, but mostly second lieutenants.

45:16.176 --> 45:17.918
Were you on the CCC payroll?

45:19.099 --> 45:19.319
No.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.521
Who funded your position?

45:21.921 --> 45:23.083
Forest Service.

45:23.103 --> 45:24.344
Okay, Forest Service.

45:24.364 --> 45:30.510
And depending on the camp, you got a different insight into the politics of the thing.

45:30.530 --> 45:35.575
Some of them were interior camps, Department of the Interior, and some were the agriculture.

45:35.595 --> 45:37.817
Once in the agriculture, the political thing

45:38.641 --> 45:46.990
I think probably because the Forest Service was the, the funds must have come through the Forest Service.

45:47.010 --> 46:01.486
I was too young to understand all of this, but in a way they, I remember once vividly, there were two camps in Massachusetts, one not too far from one another, and I knew some of the people in both.

46:01.506 --> 46:06.471
I was over one night at the interior camp where I had been stationed

46:06.907 --> 46:10.352
because I got work crews out of there at one time.
