WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:04.542
Hurry up, little thing. Tell me now. School's 
started.

00:12.415 --> 00:23.553
If someone were to ask you, what is reading, what 
would you tell them that you thought it was? Talk

00:23.573 --> 00:24.655
reading now. Talk written down. Okay, then when 
you read, that's right, that's the way I would

00:27.525 --> 00:31.951
express it too. Then when you read, would you say, 
this is a red ball? Or how would you read that?

00:45.150 --> 00:46.772
How would you say it to me? This is A. A red ball. This 
is a red ball. All right. Would you say the car is

00:54.772 --> 00:58.816
blue? No, I'd say

00:59.477 --> 01:08.685
the car is blue. All right. B is the and A is the. 
That's right. A is a. Okay, I think that's a good

01:21.404 --> 01:23.507
deal. Now, what in the world, we have history, 
don't we? Yes. Well, what is that? His story. It's

01:32.318 --> 01:35.483
his story of who? Of the person who wrote it. Well, 
that's exactly right, and that's a good answer.

01:41.530 --> 01:43.273
That's a good answer. Now, we talk about science 
and people. people say, I like science better than

01:47.963 --> 01:52.250
anything. Really, when you talk about science, 
what is science? Science is projects.

02:02.407 --> 02:11.862
It's like how they made the airplane and the 
football and the basketball and the volleyball

02:02.407 --> 02:11.862
and the And I gave you a pretty good definition 
yesterday. It's, what did I tell you about,

02:20.109 --> 02:29.718
well, who made this world? God. All right. Then 
what would science be? It would be about the world.

02:37.245 --> 02:42.169
The creation of all the things in the world, 
wouldn't it? Yes. And what did we say about the? The

02:47.199 --> 02:48.700
sky. Sky. Stars. Moon.

02:57.249 --> 02:57.330
Sun. That's right. Everything. God created 
everything. Did God make anything bad or was it all

03:02.635 --> 03:05.778
good? It was all good creation. And who made it bad? 
The devil. And we didn't. That's right. The devil

03:16.722 --> 03:22.030
and the rest of us made the bad part, didn't we? 
Okay. Well, all right. Now, I guess we better

03:23.952 --> 03:26.676
get... If you were going to start out with a little 
boy like we did yesterday, that he didn't know what

03:27.057 --> 03:39.375
addition was... How would you try to tell him what 
addition was? Addition? It's just pick out words.

03:50.341 --> 03:50.621
It. Is it words or is it something else?

04:00.335 --> 04:01.576
It. Numbers. Numbers. And what do you do to them? 
You just write them down and sort them. And then

04:09.764 --> 04:12.948
Just cross the line out in fours. That's when you do 
your multiplication. Addition, what do you put,

04:16.932 --> 04:21.457
like?

04:21.477 --> 04:21.918
Four. Two and two makes? Four. Well, what do you do 
to make that, though? You take. You put them

04:29.206 --> 04:30.448
together. Put them together. All right. You put 
them together. Addition means to put things

04:34.263 --> 04:36.667
together. To add two and to pull together, doesn't 
it? Yes. Well, what does subtract mean? Take it

04:42.375 --> 04:43.317
away. Don't put it together. Pull it apart. Take it 
apart. That's right. Move it apart. Okay. I guess

04:51.329 --> 04:52.591
that's the way we go. How do you write your twos to a 
hundred for me? No, that's all right. Oh, no. Here

05:02.576 --> 05:02.996
you go. Make him start all over. All right. Oh, 
well, if you want to use that. Yeah, you can use it.

05:09.402 --> 05:10.804
He's already got it marked. But how do you do? If you 
were going to start out now to tell a little boy,

05:13.306 --> 05:22.535
well, I can show you how you can write your twos to 
100 right quick. What would you tell him the first

05:22.555 --> 05:24.637
thing to do? Start with one. And do what? And go to 20 
and then cross 2. 2 is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18,

05:31.780 --> 05:43.156
20. Well, sure. Then you'd go back and say 1 times 2 
is what? 1 times 2 is 2. All right. And 2 times 2 is 4.

05:57.157 --> 06:02.705
Two times three is six. Two times five is eight. No, 
two times four. Four is eight. Two times five is

06:10.957 --> 06:14.803
ten. And you show him every one of those right down 
the line. That's right. Has that been hard for you

06:19.870 --> 06:21.633
now? No. It's easy, isn't it? All right, if you 
wanted to write a three, what would you do? You

06:28.713 --> 06:38.183
would skip these two and put three in, and then skip 
this one and this one and put that one, and then skip

06:28.713 --> 06:38.183
this one and this one and this one and put that one. 
Every third one, you'd scratch out, wouldn't you?

06:41.567 --> 06:52.459
Then you'd go back and say, one times three is 
three, two times three is six, three times three is

06:41.567 --> 06:52.459
nine, And then 3?

06:57.040 --> 07:02.229
3 times 4 is 12. 3 times 5 is 15. 3 times 6 is 18. 3 times 
7 is 40. 21. That a boy. Now you got it. Now that, you

07:22.349 --> 07:29.699
see how much easier that is than having to, having 
to make all of those times and things? Yeah. It's a

07:30.841 --> 07:32.543
lot easier. Yeah, put that 21 down there so you'll 
know it. That's good. All right, I see you bought a

07:38.011 --> 07:41.676
brand new book this morning. Library. A library 
book. Well, that's good. And, um,

07:50.455 --> 07:51.856
And what is that about? It's about a horse that 
doesn't have his mama. Well, what do we have around

07:55.721 --> 07:59.745
here that doesn't have a mama? A calf outside. Sure 
do. Do you know that he had to lay down? I made him lay

08:05.931 --> 08:08.033
down again yesterday. What for? I'm teaching him 
to lay down. To mine. When I tell him to lay down, I

08:16.242 --> 08:19.045
want her to lay down. Yeah, when you want to sit, 
sit. Well, she's pretty good. She minds pretty

08:26.504 --> 08:27.665
good. All right, now that is, oh, how many words can 
you find in this today? What is this? Lonesome.

08:43.706 --> 08:44.908
All right, lonesome. All right, what word is this? 
Little. Right here. Me. All right. What is this

08:50.895 --> 08:53.459
word? So. What is that word? So me. So. Some. 
S-O-M-E. Some, isn't it? Some. All right. What is

09:05.177 --> 09:05.958
this?

09:10.125 --> 09:10.946
One. All right.

09:15.814 --> 09:16.094
Once. All right.

09:21.513 --> 09:24.916
L-O-N.

09:21.513 --> 09:24.916
On. Long. All right. What's this?

09:31.383 --> 09:31.563
On. O-N. All right. Good. Good. What's this word?

09:39.131 --> 09:39.851
It. Good.

09:45.157 --> 09:51.503
Well, if you took this letter and put it with this 
letter in code, what would it be? Put this one first

09:52.006 --> 09:57.852
and that

09:52.006 --> 09:57.852
one. T-O, what would that be? T-O. Toe? Two. Two. 
What's T-O-O spelled? T-O-O, two. What is T-W-O

10:07.262 --> 10:09.604
spelled? T-W-O, two. All right. T-W-O is what kind 
of a two? It's T-W-O is a... It's the real two. The

10:19.407 --> 10:19.868
real? It's the number two. That's right, the 
number two. And what is the T-double-O? It's just

10:26.475 --> 10:33.343
two to say, like, you can go to the store, too. Yeah. 
You can go to the store, too, meaning the other one

10:34.484 --> 10:39.650
can, too. All right. And two just means one. Okay. 
We got that one down pretty good. We got that one

10:49.970 --> 10:51.595
down pretty good. And what did we decide language 
was? Language? Yesterday, when we was all talking

10:55.729 --> 10:58.598
about language.

11:01.868 --> 11:19.351
You know, we have to know, they'll say, well, we're 
going to have some language today and we're going

11:01.868 --> 11:19.351
to have periods and commas and we're going to study 
what somebody said and how you write it and what you

11:01.868 --> 11:19.351
put down.

11:24.257 --> 11:25.239
Have you forgotten? All right. What did we say 
about people? Its

11:30.877 --> 11:50.035
language is

11:30.877 --> 11:50.035
the way people

11:30.877 --> 11:50.035
D-A-L-K.

11:50.055 --> 11:50.556
Taught. It's their talk. Now, do the Spanish talk 
like we do? No. They have a language of their own.

11:59.154 --> 12:01.337
But they speak. It's the way people speak. That's 
right. And it's their dialect that they have. And

12:08.807 --> 12:11.391
we have a different one from other people. And 
don't every community have a different dialect,

12:12.572 --> 12:17.119
different way of talking? And they have 
different... They say different things now over

12:19.645 --> 12:22.768
in Hawaii. When they put up their finger like a 
little finger and a thumb like that, they'll reach

12:23.669 --> 12:29.836
it. And they'll and you know what that means. Hang 
loose. Because they'll hang you from here to here,

12:36.503 --> 12:39.987
but it would be loose. They couldn't pull it down. 
Hang loose alright. How do you make the sign of hook

12:44.932 --> 12:48.876
them horns? Okay, that's these two fingers, 
hook'em horns. All right, now you see every, every

12:55.465 --> 13:07.898
one has a different, that's a language, and that's 
a sign language that each have different. You see

13:07.918 --> 13:09.100
what I mean? Now, this is hook'em horns. And what is 
this now? Hang loose. Hang loose, okay. Hang

13:20.834 --> 13:21.736
loose. And you see people come and meet you on the 
street, and they'll, all right, grab your hand

13:22.958 --> 13:35.379
like that, and they'll pull down like that. That's 
another sign language. And that is what?

13:43.233 --> 13:44.375
What? What would you think that would be? Hi. Hi, 
greeting, that's right. That's a different word.

13:52.097 --> 13:54.480
With Texas, hi, brother, hi. And that's what we say 
to an old cow when we're trying to get her to go back.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.569
Hi, right? Yeah. And I guess that word hi is used 
only in Texas to any extent. Definitely that is one

14:11.071 --> 14:14.414
of Texas colloquialism. Hi. And push your hand. 
Backwards. Hi. Hi. And that's the way we talk to old

14:21.921 --> 14:24.884
cows when we're trying to pin them. Trying to get 
them going. Hi. That's a tradition that was handed

14:30.569 --> 14:39.998
down by all the old trail drivers. And let me tell 
you, while we're talking about stories and

14:41.176 --> 15:02.857
history, before we get to our reading, did you know 
that one of the largest trail drives that Texas

14:41.176 --> 15:02.857
ever knew was a Chisholm, or people in the north or 
west, was the Chisholm Trail? And do you know that

15:03.558 --> 15:08.803
my grandfather and my great-uncle were the 
largest trail drovers of the Chisholm Trail from

15:09.779 --> 15:16.978
1860 to 1878.

15:19.324 --> 15:23.856
Tom

15:19.324 --> 15:23.856
and Sam Johnson. Well, my father's name was Tom, 
and Lyndon's father's name was Sam. And they were

15:31.959 --> 15:36.185
named after these big trail drivers. And up here 
where I work, where that, you see that picture

15:36.205 --> 15:40.011
right there? Yeah. I'm sitting on the porch with 
that little hen. I called her Chicken Little. And

15:45.599 --> 15:49.385
I'd call her, and she'd come and jump up in my lap. I 
could just call, just like I would call a, a dog to

15:52.709 --> 15:54.854
come and feed. I'd say, come on, chicken little, 
I'll feed you. And she'd just come a-running to the

15:57.700 --> 16:04.575
house, jump up in my lap, and eat corn out of my hand. 
And it pleased the people to see her. And she was a

16:07.402 --> 16:09.807
little old spotted Well, I don't know, just a 
chicken. She had a few black spots on her, and she

16:14.445 --> 16:23.355
had some rhodolin red in her, and she looked like 
she might have a little primal throat. She's just a

16:23.395 --> 16:24.396
chicken. You remember how she did? And I said, come 
on now, chicken little. And she'd jump up on my

16:30.122 --> 16:39.793
shoulder and just sing, sit while I'd be in that 
chair. and saying of course i think sometimes she

16:40.685 --> 17:10.219
might leave her calling card on me but she didn't

16:40.685 --> 17:10.219
now what did i tell you about the trail drives that 
the uh 1892 to 1879

16:40.685 --> 17:10.219
from 18 and 60 to 1878, the Johnson brothers went

17:10.672 --> 17:24.032
up the Chisholm Trail. They took more cattle up the 
Chisholm Trail. Now that was in Culpeper Cattle

17:27.077 --> 17:32.325
Company's report. They took theirs to Dodge City 
most of the time. And in the cold winter, they lost

17:37.415 --> 17:44.186
nearly all they had one time they froze to death. 
When was that? I remember it. The history of it. I

17:50.816 --> 17:52.018
believe it was in It was in the 70s. Yeah. But I have 
forgotten. I could go look it up, but I remember the

17:56.816 --> 18:00.700
history. Well, I remember Grandpa telling me 
about it. Do you? Oh, Lord, yes. Cattle froze up

18:05.985 --> 18:09.028
against the fence? Yes. Imagine that. They would 
pack up against the fence and try to keep warm, and

18:10.810 --> 18:18.097
they'd just freeze to death just standing there, 
just stiff as boards. And that's where I worked.

18:21.641 --> 18:22.782
That's where he lived. you know, where we went to 
tell that story, you know, where I took you all and

18:23.977 --> 18:30.477
told you about it. Well, now that was the cattle 
ground. And that hole of water, they always called

18:34.012 --> 18:38.236
that the Johnson Watering Hole. And they would 
bring their cattle there because water was simply

18:39.097 --> 18:49.969
something that they had to take care of with their 
stock because they didn't have a lot as they'd go

18:39.097 --> 18:49.969
across the desert. Yes, they had to go across the 
deserts and things that they didn't have any. And

18:54.995 --> 18:57.257
they'd have to stop there and water. And that same 
water hole, you know, what else happened with that

18:58.537 --> 19:05.489
same water hole?

19:07.792 --> 19:12.861
Somebody's mother went to get some water and 
thought you didn't trust them. Opened the flap and

19:12.881 --> 19:19.692
she ran back to the house and hid under the house. 
Who was that woman?

19:23.959 --> 19:24.119
You. Grandmother. That's right. My grandmother. 
That sure is right. And what'd she do to that baby?

19:32.619 --> 19:39.717
She... She... She took it under the house with her. 
And... Hit it there. She hit the baby, but she tied a

19:43.335 --> 19:50.783
diaper around the other little girl's mouth 
because she cried and didn't have anything to eat.

19:51.284 --> 19:54.287
She would nurse both of them off of her breasts. And 
then without any water and without anything to

19:54.307 --> 20:03.778
eat, she had very little milk for a whole day and a 
whole night.

20:06.830 --> 20:10.353
And she tied the diaper around the baby's mouth so 
it wouldn't cry. And when the other one, when she

20:11.074 --> 20:19.903
put it on the breast and it started to cry, well, she 
put her hand over its mouth.

20:19.943 --> 20:23.046
You know, that's bound to have been quite an 
experience. Yes. It must have been scary. I tell

20:26.969 --> 20:30.132
you, my grandmother had the blackest eyes. They 
were piercing eyes. And they talked. They did.

20:34.184 --> 20:41.975
They talked, and she just said, now, Samely, I'm 
not raising my little girls in this wilderness.

20:43.357 --> 20:46.261
You're taking me back to the prairie. Well, the 
prairie was Buda. Now, just think, right down

20:50.006 --> 20:55.514
here, not, well, I guess maybe it's 45 miles. I 
doubt if it is. But... This was a timbered country,

20:59.513 --> 21:04.241
and that was prairie. And she says, close to 
civilization, says, I cannot stand to live here

21:05.202 --> 21:14.297
with these Indians. And she was one of the best 
shots with a gun. And she could ride a horse like an

21:19.886 --> 21:23.331
Indian. But, She was scared because grandfather 
would be gone months at a time and leave her there.

21:35.309 --> 21:37.673
Were these Apache Indians or were they? 
Comanches. Comanches, that's right. Comanches.

21:40.077 --> 21:40.778
I was wrong. I thought so, yeah. Yeah, they were 
Comanches and they were killers. Yeah, that's

21:45.165 --> 21:46.848
right. And it hasn't been, but... Well, after he 
took her back, it was two weeks after he took her

21:54.087 --> 22:13.507
back to the prairie that the Comanches killed the 
Phelpses over here and scalped them because he was

21:54.087 --> 22:13.507
a red-headed man and Indians loved red hair. And 
they scalped him and killed his wife there at the

22:14.108 --> 22:22.677
spring getting water. She said, that could have 
easily been me and my babies. I'll never forget

22:27.991 --> 22:31.855
grandmother telling me the story of that. And of 
course, I'd love to hear it. And I'd love to see if

22:36.661 --> 22:43.389
there's Indians around me and all that kind of 
stuff. I was afraid. But we did have, coming

22:45.952 --> 22:51.398
through here, Even up to 1910, every once in a 
while, there'd be a bunch of them coming through,

22:51.682 --> 22:59.129
but they would be friendly. But nevertheless, 
they'd scare the daylights out of you. After

23:02.693 --> 23:06.136
stories like that, I bet it would make you feel 
scared. It makes you scared. And

23:08.018 --> 23:18.448
they killed a beef there in the barn, stole their 
horses, stole their silver-mounted horses, that

23:19.390 --> 23:23.876
she had for her buggy and her saddle. What else did 
they get in the house? They got food and pots and

23:27.522 --> 23:31.667
pans. Everything they had. They just took it all. 
They would tear up the house after they got through

23:37.896 --> 23:41.261
and burn it. Everything they could get. 
Grandmother hadn't unpacked her wedding gifts.

23:48.550 --> 23:54.358
She had them in a big box and they took them. I tell 
you, the way she talked, she had, her first few

23:54.378 --> 24:01.609
years were hard. But grandfather made good money. 
You know, I've never understood why he didn't pay

24:05.695 --> 24:11.503
his men on the drive. He never paid them until he 
came back. And he paid, you know that table It's in

24:18.520 --> 24:26.215
the, up there in that old log cabin, table like 
that. And why I know this, Mr. Klett,

24:26.235 --> 24:38.520
Charlie Klett boarded with my mother and father, 
and he went up the trail with my grandfather. Well,

24:38.686 --> 24:45.753
he outlived my grandfather by 20 years, because he 
was that much younger. And he told me all about how

24:46.814 --> 24:52.000
my grandfather handled his business. And he never 
paid his hands only in gold bars. Oh, really?

24:58.947 --> 25:01.149
That's the way he paid his cattle rustle. It's a 
good way to be paid, isn't it? Yeah. His gold bars.

25:07.694 --> 25:12.039
All right, now what have you had this morning to 
study? This morning I had

25:13.440 --> 25:28.015
about

25:13.440 --> 25:28.015
history and language and

25:13.440 --> 25:28.015
numbers. Numbers, and what else? And I did my 
reading. What about, who made this world? God.

25:36.837 --> 25:38.079
Well, what do you call that? Sun.

25:43.588 --> 25:51.159
What's all this nature all around us and all of the 
birds and animals, all of the trees, what do we call

25:43.588 --> 25:51.159
that? Sun. Sun. Science. Science, that's right. 
Now we have two or three different kinds of

25:59.672 --> 26:03.396
science, don't we? Yes. Yes, we sure do. But who is 
responsible for all of that science? That's

26:12.407 --> 26:14.009
right, but who is that? God. The man upstairs, 
that's right. That's right. And he only made what

26:20.196 --> 26:25.963
kind of things? Good thing. That's right. That's 
right. Now then, we're going. Well, all right.

26:32.408 --> 26:34.430
Let's see if you can. Oh, we did something else, 
too, didn't we? We read. What did we do? We read the

26:39.874 --> 26:40.875
book. Yes, sir. We picked out a bunch of words, 
didn't we? Uh-huh. What did your mama think about

26:45.219 --> 26:49.663

26:49.783 --> 26:51.825

anything. Well, I'm going to have to get after her.

27:23.470 --> 27:40.654

little cult and they all

27:53.660 --> 28:20.206

Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Yes. Ma'am. Ma'am. Each little

28:54.342 --> 28:59.728
colt started close. Where did he do? What is that 
word? S-T-A-Y. Stayed. Close.

29:10.940 --> 29:11.661
Where is he? Close to his mother. Beside. Beside
