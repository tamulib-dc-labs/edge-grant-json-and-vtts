WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:09.362
We started out to get to Tunisia as quick as 
possible. And the only way we had to go was to walk

00:10.443 --> 00:15.430
across the top of Africa. But the regimental 
commander said, it was raining and we were going to

00:16.311 --> 00:24.442
have our feet wet and we were going to be crippled. 
So he said, just don't go any further. I'll be back

00:28.467 --> 00:29.408
later. And he went into Iran. to some motor pool and 
gave a hand receipt for a whole flock of vehicles,

00:31.857 --> 00:37.282
and off we went. And we drove all the way across 
North Africa. And in those mountains, it was cold.

00:47.531 --> 00:50.173
And as I said, I woke up one day, my ring was gone. And 
I didn't have any idea. I figured I'd flung it off my

00:54.336 --> 00:58.280
hand during the night in that cold. But about two to 
three weeks later, A driver was cleaning the Jeep,

01:01.321 --> 01:07.417
and he found it down in the floorboard of the Jeep 
under a lot of stuff. And so I was, of course, real

01:08.600 --> 01:14.014
glad to get it back.

01:18.078 --> 01:23.226
Are there any stories that you have where somebody 
spotted you wearing an Aggie ring? Well, I've had a

01:23.747 --> 01:29.796
lot of people through the years say, what's that 
ring? And I say, it's an Aggie ring. Yeah, it's an

01:31.799 --> 01:32.760
Aggie ring. And hear me here, they want to know what 
the ring is for. See, they bathe us three times a

01:39.370 --> 01:45.760
week and shave me every now and then, too, with an 
electric razor. After I got I had this last

01:47.356 --> 01:50.879
operation, Haskell. I went from being 
independent to totally dependent. I'll tell you

01:56.325 --> 01:58.026
about that in a few minutes, but anyway. And

01:58.887 --> 02:04.953
when they go to baby, sometimes that ring comes 
off. But they all know what that ring is now. Here,

02:09.937 --> 02:13.701
as soon as I get through the breakfast, They'll 
take you down and bathe you. And they bathe me three

02:17.119 --> 02:19.042
times a week. I cannot do anything, 
unfortunately. I had a rebuilt knee in here. And I

02:28.094 --> 02:31.459
wore it out pushing this one. And it was the, I 
believe, the second or third one I had. Anyway, the

02:36.425 --> 02:41.933
doctor told us there were two doctors that they 
recommended in the College of Medicine. I mean,

02:42.790 --> 02:48.798
Texas Medical Center down here, that would have 
taken them out and rebuilt them. And so Dr. Tullis

02:50.220 --> 02:56.407
took this one out, and it was the worst, he said, the 
worst condition he had ever seen a knee. It

02:57.849 --> 02:59.191
naturally would be. It was full of infection

03:00.493 --> 03:10.165
and bone fragments, and they took it all out of 
there and rebuilt it. And for a long time, we had a

03:10.853 --> 03:16.499
piece of bone that wasn't knitting. I finally 
ended up getting a big skin graft on this knee. And

03:24.228 --> 03:28.072
as a result, I've not been able to walk a whole lot 
since.

03:31.936 --> 03:40.506
When

03:31.936 --> 03:40.506
they took the thing out, he said he'd put a new one 
in. And in time, he thought I'd be able to walk on it.

03:43.908 --> 03:48.272
I don't think I'll ever walk again because every 
step hurts.

03:52.456 --> 03:55.159
They told me to get these shoes. I call them New 
Comfort or something, anyway. They don't slip or

04:04.007 --> 04:05.128
slide. Used to, when I'd get up, I'd slip or slide, 
and this would hurt more. But now, and I took a week

04:10.186 --> 04:27.790
in the hospital in Houston

04:10.186 --> 04:27.790
where they worked on me and tried to teach me a 
little bit better how to walk and those things. But

04:28.462 --> 04:35.009
I have a hard time because that knee has not healed 
yet. I

04:36.151 --> 04:42.218
can do a lot of things, but it'll get better sooner 
or later. I hope. Let's see. Describe for you the

04:45.942 --> 04:53.130
great events of commissioning and commencement 
day. Sure. I can't think that far back. That would

04:58.212 --> 04:59.854
have been the spring of 38.

05:02.838 --> 05:04.119
Commissioning, let me think. Well, we graduated 
in the morning and were commissioned in the

05:05.561 --> 05:11.629
afternoon, if I remember this right. Also,

05:13.211 --> 05:21.621
at that time, I believe we had a review for the 
reviewing officers. Came from Fort Sam. Oh, and do

05:27.622 --> 05:30.128
you remember Major R? Who? Did you ever hear of 
Major R? Well, he would have been a captain for a

05:35.582 --> 05:40.133
thousand years for this reason.

05:44.399 --> 05:55.514
No one knows why, but when the visiting officer 
came in on the train from San Antonio, they sent

05:44.399 --> 05:55.514
Major Orr down to beat him. So he walked up to him and 
didn't salute him, nothing. He just stuck his hand

05:59.660 --> 06:09.994
out and says, Orr is my name, O-R-R. God, I'm 
telling you, that man, that colonel, I should have

05:59.660 --> 06:09.994
gone through the truth. And he...

06:14.521 --> 06:17.545
And he had a dog named Rip.

06:20.530 --> 06:21.151
Rip Orr? Rip Orr. And we would go to Camp Bullets in 
the summer.

06:30.444 --> 06:31.466
Let me close this door.

06:40.579 --> 06:42.081
Rip went everywhere. Rip went everywhere that 
Major Orr went. Captain Orr, he finally got

06:47.426 --> 06:49.609
promoted to Major, though. I believe he was the 
Major when he went to meet the Colonel. Anyway,

06:55.476 --> 07:05.188
we'd be out on the fire line at camp, putting 
bullets, and old Rip would be out there, too. And I

07:06.149 --> 07:09.013
remember Orr said, Rip! gets your ass off the funny 
line before you get perforated

07:09.652 --> 07:35.507
and always with his nasal tone you know but uh we had 
a commissioning was i said we just it was a formal

07:09.652 --> 07:35.507
ceremony and that's in the afternoon after 
graduation in the morning and after we were

07:09.652 --> 07:35.507
commissioned i believe that we commissioned we 
put on a Of course, that was a highlight in all our

07:36.112 --> 07:43.380
lives, that we were in the thing. See, everybody 
didn't get an advance contract. If you got an

07:49.747 --> 07:52.130
advance contract, you got a commission. And 
that's when you got rid of the government-issued

07:53.892 --> 08:00.820
uniform and bought your own. And I remember that, 
again, I got one of everything I needed in a uniform

08:01.390 --> 08:07.936
for $100. And Lord, I don't know what that cost 
them. But I do know that it was much, much later when

08:12.160 --> 08:17.986
the war came on that I had to buy another uniform.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.911
A commencement was held at Guyon Hall.

08:27.695 --> 08:27.955
Let me think. I don't know where it was held. I guess 
it was held everywhere. Do you remember who the

08:32.656 --> 08:34.058
speaker was? Who came, friends and family, who 
came for your commissioning and commencement? I

08:42.769 --> 08:44.772
didn't have anybody. Let me think of it. 
Graduation and commencement. See, my

08:49.078 --> 08:52.463
grandmother raised me. Yes. By this time, she had 
retired and moved. She had moved to Tyler to be with

08:57.489 --> 09:00.253
her daughter. And I don't think we had anybody 
come. Did Freda come? I don't remember. I'm sure

09:09.551 --> 09:23.226
she didn't because we didn't start going together 
until my junior year,

09:09.551 --> 09:23.226
I believe. I can't remember all those things, 
really. As you graduated, what kind of life did you

09:27.200 --> 09:34.551
think you were going to be pursuing? Well, I 
thought I would be working in landscape work, but

09:35.572 --> 09:42.462
there weren't any jobs available.

09:47.169 --> 09:54.259
The guys in front of us had gone to work for Lamberts 
in Dallas, and they were shelving manure. So I

09:55.501 --> 09:56.903
thought it was my scoop. And I went back to school 
and got my master's. I had 20 hours of work over my

10:01.301 --> 10:05.585
master's. And so I got to do my master's in one year. 
At A&M? At A&M, which would be a term paper now

10:11.731 --> 10:17.536
anywhere else. And I do the thesis on the use of 
native plants in landscape design. Who was your

10:27.005 --> 10:28.126
chairman? Who directed it? Mr. Hensel. But they 
gave me the chairman of the English department on

10:30.889 --> 10:35.234
the committee. And he read a line. I couldn't buy 
and pay to have it typed. But he read a line so bad, 14

10:46.225 --> 10:53.333
pages, that I had to have redone and no one to do it 
with. And he complained, he said, this boy has

10:53.903 --> 11:02.115
personified all these plants. They're just like 
people to him. I said, yes, that's right. He used it

11:08.264 --> 11:11.789
that way. Was that Dr. Cofer? No, Summey. Oh, Dr. 
Summey. Yeah. Dr. Summey. That threw me for a loop.

11:21.767 --> 11:25.771
And I spent a week in the hospital after I got 
through with all of that. See, I did that thing in

11:26.692 --> 11:30.236
nine months, which was too quick. Anyway, I spent a 
week in the hospital. And

11:33.319 --> 11:40.545
month of that, meanwhile, I got a good job with that 
master's degree. Jacques Goebbels, who I

11:41.446 --> 11:45.330
mentioned earlier, brought this young man up. I 
mean, he was brought over by Mr. Gilchrist, to

11:50.080 --> 11:53.964
start the roadside beautification program. And 
Jack Goebbels did it. So I got a job in District 9 as

11:56.827 --> 12:02.874
roadside beautification chairman. And that was 
$140 a month. That was big money. What part of state

12:08.661 --> 12:10.262
was District 9? Waco. Waco with Edwards. And there 
were seven counties around as far as Hamilton

12:13.726 --> 12:19.092
County. And

12:19.527 --> 12:30.177
I worked the first

12:19.527 --> 12:30.177
eight or nine months in the soil laboratory. And 
Mr. Puckett was the district engineer. He came out

12:37.625 --> 12:43.611
one day and said, well, I put you out here to find out 
if you could work. And he says, you don't mind

12:43.631 --> 12:48.235
working, so we're going to give you We're going to 
make you a roadside beautician for this district.

12:52.167 --> 12:56.651
So get your car and get ready to do the roadside 
work. Well, then we had a person like that in every

12:56.671 --> 13:03.998
district in the county, I mean in the state. And we 
had regular meetings and lectures and seminars

13:04.778 --> 13:09.883
and things. And we'd have to write books and little 
pamphlets on this. So we saw the beginning of the

13:14.587 --> 13:16.669
Texas Highway. that spread all over the country. 
But John Goebbels was a good man. As you were

13:25.150 --> 13:36.147
getting ready to start that first job, how well 
prepared did it seem A&M had made you for that kind

13:25.150 --> 13:36.147
of work? Well, I thought good. I was well pleased 
with what I did, and I'm very happy all the way

13:43.700 --> 13:52.929
through school under Ms. Henson's leadership, 
because if it was something we didn't need to know,

13:43.700 --> 13:52.929
he'd tell us. And he didn't say a word, but he'd tell 
us. And we got good advice. And also the man that I

13:58.754 --> 14:11.226
told you about in entomology, Dr. Little, I 
believe is his name, both of them were good

13:58.754 --> 14:11.226
teachers, excellent teachers. And Mitch was a 
great mentor. He'd tell me all kinds of things. I

14:17.416 --> 14:19.961
have to say, every time I went back to A&M, I went to 
see him. And we spent many happy hours together

14:20.843 --> 14:27.595
working on these things. But I thought I was as well 
prepared as anybody as I could be in a new field. It

14:34.321 --> 14:35.403
was a brand new field. They didn't even know what I 
was taking at home. Somebody asked my

14:38.125 --> 14:41.049
grandmother, what's Robert taking? Well, I don't 
know what he's having to leave me alone, which I

14:41.709 --> 14:45.753
thought was pretty good advice. Now, when did you 
buy your first car?

14:51.780 --> 14:54.022
I got my message in. So it's after you. After you 
leave school? Oh, yeah, after I leave school. I

15:01.276 --> 15:05.046
didn't need a car until I got to do the roadside 
work. Now, did you ever hitchhike when you were an

15:05.067 --> 15:07.292
Aggie? Oh, yeah. Describe how an Aggie 
hitchhiked. Going my way. Of course, you know we

15:14.046 --> 15:16.649
had regular stations. You stayed in line, took 
your turn in line. Of course, my problem was, when I

15:20.214 --> 15:26.682
was in Transactor Franklin, coming back to see 
Russ, there wasn't anybody coming this way. Or

15:27.783 --> 15:28.785
they were already full. And I know one time, during 
my senior year, My grandmother had sold the hotel

15:36.914 --> 15:48.714
and moved to Tyler, and we, a whole bunch of us, got 
stuck in Palestine. I think there's 25 or 30 of us in

15:48.734 --> 15:50.156
there. And there wasn't much, I mean, tell you, we 
thought we were going to spend the week in

15:50.237 --> 15:57.409
Palestine. And all of a sudden, everybody got 
waked up that The bus, a local bus, I need to know the

16:03.847 --> 16:12.075
kid's name, picked everybody up and took them all 
the way to college. My gosh. That was something.

16:14.997 --> 16:21.664
Now, if you were going north to Franklin, where did 
you catch the ride in College Station? Called it

16:21.684 --> 16:23.405
Brian. Where? On the corner of the courthouse, 
across the street from the courthouse. Now, how

16:29.831 --> 16:32.554
did you get from the campus up to Brian? Same way, 
some way. Oh. Yeah. With your thumb? With my thumb.

16:38.637 --> 16:47.007
And a long time as you were going to Franklin, you 
didn't get a very good priority in Hearn. People

16:48.348 --> 16:49.830
were going to go further than that. They didn't 
want you taking the ride just to Franklin, 13

16:51.252 --> 16:55.517
miles. Did you ever have any bad experience 
hitchhiking? No. Did you have any interesting

17:01.643 --> 17:06.830
experiences that you'd like to share? Rode

17:06.870 --> 17:11.737
with some interesting people? Well,

17:11.777 --> 17:20.149
nothing special except that bus incident. We got 
30-some people on one corner and couldn't get out.

17:26.358 --> 17:28.140
We're still in there, I believe it. While you were 
an undergraduate, what did you do in the summers?

17:33.434 --> 17:34.114
Worked. Where? Right there. You stayed on the 
campus? I never went home. And worked full time? I

17:40.100 --> 17:42.523
never went home. Where did you and your buddies go 
to have some fun other than hardlickers? No, you

17:48.649 --> 17:49.790
never went to hardlickers. Where did you go for fun 
on a Saturday night? I didn't have to have any fun. I

17:57.078 --> 18:06.291
probably washed pots all day

17:57.078 --> 18:06.291
How often did you go home to Franklin? I didn't go 
home I didn't go I was going to work I needed to work

18:06.311 --> 18:26.578
to get a little money to go to school next year and I 
was to go and then you were Did you by chance

18:06.311 --> 18:26.578
encounter Mr. Gilchrist soon after he got here? 
Oh, yes. Describe him, please. Well, he was, I

18:31.901 --> 18:34.765
thought, a very good president. Everybody was a 
little bit aghast to hire somebody from the

18:35.486 --> 18:42.815
University of Texas, you know, to take that job. 
No, he had a good vision, and he was determined that

18:43.777 --> 18:55.992
we would get the roadside program underway, and 
that's when I brought Jock Goebbels over and...

18:58.553 --> 19:02.619
I enjoyed Mr. Gilchrist very much. Henry, his son, 
told me that when they first moved here that he was

19:03.380 --> 19:14.897
homesick for Austin because the campus was so 
rural and isolated, he thought. But his dad bought

19:15.939 --> 19:22.388
him a bike as a bribe to make him happy. I hadn't 
heard that one. After he retired... He had his

19:26.330 --> 19:30.634
garage made into a den in our study. And he had all 
kinds of citations on all the walls. And she

19:35.019 --> 19:39.803
collected unusual bottles. And I had a green 
bottle shaped like a human. And I gave it to her. But

19:48.832 --> 19:53.637
no, I enjoyed Mr. Gilchrist very much. He had some 
friends in Mumford. I don't know their name.

20:00.691 --> 20:05.376
Anyway, she was a great roadside person. I can't 
think of her name. Too many years.

20:17.169 --> 20:20.293
Well, that's beside the point now. On the campus 
where all the faculty lived, was, describe that as

20:24.397 --> 20:29.562
a, that was a little community in its own. A little 
community in its own. And I was told that to get

20:31.744 --> 20:40.552
people there, they had to have housing, because 
there wasn't any place for them to live in that

20:31.744 --> 20:40.552
area. And I remember where they, the different 
ones, Dean's house, and as you went from now, what

20:40.572 --> 20:53.745
would it be, the MSC corner, Mr. Hensel's house was 
on that corner. And

20:54.738 --> 21:16.604
over where

20:54.738 --> 21:16.604
the football dormitory is, there were two streets 
over there that had faculty houses on them, too.

21:17.385 --> 21:19.728
And that's where Mr. McGinnis lived. He was a 
professor in the department. keep Frida farm when

21:23.324 --> 21:25.746
she came down. She can stay with them. Did any of 
those faculty folks ask you to help them with their

21:29.170 --> 21:37.278
flower gardens or anything like that? No.

21:41.141 --> 21:42.383
Did you go on court trips? Oh, yeah. Describe what a 
court trip was like. How did you get there and what

21:45.706 --> 21:48.749
did you all do? Well, they were always training 
back in the early days. And you were supposed to go,

21:55.076 --> 22:00.123
but you were irrespective. They didn't care. You 
would end up in Fort Worth, which is at the Union

22:02.706 --> 22:09.856
Station, and get organized and do the parade. And

22:10.817 --> 22:16.905
they also would...

22:18.758 --> 22:25.892
My freshman year, not having enough money, they 
said, we'll get you on the train, don't worry. They

22:26.814 --> 22:36.674
got me on the train with the seats like this, put me 
back in the man's suitcase in front of me, and I rode

22:26.814 --> 22:36.674
forward that way. And more than one kid did that 
way.

22:41.978 --> 22:50.547
You'd be expected to be at the Union Station in Fort 
Worth at 8 o'clock on a Saturday morning, and you'd

22:41.978 --> 22:50.547
parade down. And

22:52.849 --> 22:57.093
that was it. And you went to Austin or Houston each 
year also?

23:05.942 --> 23:07.764
I mean, we went to Austin, I know. Dallas or Fort 
Worth? That was for alternate years. And then

23:13.170 --> 23:15.693
Austin and Houston alternate years. Did you ever 
have any bad core trip experiences? No. I don't

23:22.060 --> 23:23.462
remember going to Houston. Maybe we did. But I 
didn't have any bad experiences.

23:31.151 --> 23:35.937
The student indulgences of the time, people 
smoked? Did the Aggies smoke much? They weren't

23:37.939 --> 23:39.441
allowed to smoke. And

23:39.742 --> 23:46.333
they went to Mr. Ed's, was whiskey. Uncle Ed's. 
Where did they buy whiskey? Don't touch it to this

23:50.319 --> 23:53.825
day, so I don't know. I know that there was talk of 
going across the county line somewhere. Going

24:02.219 --> 24:03.982
towards Snook to Whiskey Bridge. Okay. Okay. And 
did you and your buddies know the words marijuana?

24:11.067 --> 24:12.611
No. And cocaine? Never heard of any of that. Did 
some people chew tobacco in that era? Oh, they made

24:21.009 --> 24:24.075
the certain... The band, I believe, made the kids 
chew tobacco at the first baseball game and got

24:24.832 --> 24:33.924
them all sick. Certain organizations made the 
kids chew tobacco at the first baseball game and

24:36.087 --> 24:43.737
that made them all sick. Did you go to, as an 
undergraduate, did you go to an Aggie muster? I

24:51.908 --> 24:53.050
never heard of muster. Before the war, you had not 
heard of them? That's what I... Do you have that

24:55.552 --> 24:58.577
from any people? No, you're saying the same thing. 
I have the impression that muster really became a

25:01.622 --> 25:08.733
big Aggie tradition as a result of the... 
Corregidor. Corregidor muster. To be perfectly

25:10.715 --> 25:15.500
frank, I don't believe I ever heard of Muster, the 
four years I was there. And that may have been again

25:15.520 --> 25:18.943
because I was working on it. There's a lot of things 
I didn't participate in because I was working all

25:18.963 --> 25:22.126
that. I got a call from the Alfred Walt people one 
day. I heard of Alfred Walt. I don't know what it was

25:28.312 --> 25:31.115
because I didn't participate. I was working. I had 
to work to stay in school. And it's just that way.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.324
All right, now this one I think I know, though. Did 
you attend to silver taps? Yes, we had silver taps

25:46.610 --> 25:49.093
back then. Describe it, what it meant. Where was it 
held? Clean place still now, I believe.

26:00.395 --> 26:03.180
Did you and your buddies take Silver Tap 
seriously? Oh, yes. Very serious. We thought that

26:05.304 --> 26:09.151
was the most serious thing on the campus at the 
time. And I know that they played from up on the dome

26:10.513 --> 26:17.786
up there. And it was very impressive still in the 
night.

26:29.352 --> 26:34.819
What is it that creates Aggie spirit, Aggie pride? 
Aggie pride. It's just the fact that when you get

26:36.861 --> 26:43.369
into it, it never gets out of your system. As you rub 
shoulders day to day and you have the feeling of

26:45.792 --> 26:58.448
belonging to an organization and you get bonded 
together,

27:00.200 --> 27:05.547
Aggie pride is just the fact that when you came 
there, you were nothing. You got to be somebody.

27:08.832 --> 27:17.503
And for the first time, you knew people very 
closely, became very close friends. And like I

27:18.465 --> 27:27.777
said, I think the most severe blow I had was when 
David Murphy was killed in an airplane right at the

27:18.465 --> 27:27.777
beginning of our senior year. He had already asked 
me to be a Ross volunteer, which I turned down. He

27:33.163 --> 27:35.445
was on the Coastal Artillery of all places, too. I 
think we got to know each other in class.

27:41.451 --> 27:51.361
I

27:41.451 --> 27:51.361
went back to the cemetery every time, but I finally 
quit going. What are the other events other than

27:52.161 --> 27:57.747
Silver Taps that helped to create that pride,

27:58.334 --> 28:04.622
that spirit? Well, at that time, it was the fact 
that you belonged to a group, a special group. I

28:11.151 --> 28:15.216
belonged to A Infantry, and I've always enjoyed 
those people. They've been very close. In fact,

28:17.860 --> 28:23.447
one of my very best friends in A Infantry just died 
this summer.

28:26.228 --> 28:31.273
It's the cohesiveness and the fact that you belong 
and you know you belong. And everybody's good to

28:32.474 --> 28:34.536
each other. As you were preparing to leave A&M for 
that first job, did you feel well prepared for that

28:37.018 --> 28:45.166
task?

28:47.728 --> 28:50.891
I thought I was well prepared for anything but A&M 
because of the new program. They're starting

28:51.592 --> 28:53.493
brand new in Texas. And of course, The Texas 
Wildfire, the Texas Roadside Development

28:55.844 --> 29:00.883
Program has spread all over the country. I know 
where it started and who did it. We used to take a He

29:05.885 --> 29:10.353
used to mow the field and get the straw and throw 
them on the road. Now they have wildflower farms

29:10.674 --> 29:14.742
you can buy them by the pounds. And you know what 
they do now? They put them in capsules, gelatin

29:17.567 --> 29:26.003
capsules, and just throw them on the roadside and 
they melt and go right there.

29:26.725 --> 29:36.838
Were you concerned

29:26.725 --> 29:36.838
about what was happening in Europe at the time you 
left A&M? Yes. In fact, when I was working at the

29:38.820 --> 29:52.538
highway department, Mr. Puckett, an old agate, 
would come out every morning at 10 o'clock and turn

29:38.820 --> 29:52.538
his radio on, and we'd listen to what was happening 
over there. We were all very much aware of it.

29:57.792 --> 30:04.461
And we pretty well followed the development of it 
all the way up.

30:08.726 --> 30:11.370
I'm almost finished now with this first part. What 
have we left out of your student experiences that

30:12.371 --> 30:16.817
we should have covered?

30:21.784 --> 30:22.304
Student experiences? Let me see here. I might 
lose, but I...

30:32.858 --> 30:35.321
This is, of course, the thing that I did. I made fun 
of those sophomores, which people thought I was

30:35.361 --> 30:44.433
crazy to do, because they knew I was going to get 
patted on. And I didn't care, because I didn't

30:44.453 --> 30:46.977
think they could hurt me, and they didn't. Ga Ga 
Kama was the only man who hurt me. And I never did

30:50.201 --> 30:51.162
come back. When he hit me that one lick on the third 
floor, the heart, oh, I just kept going. But the

30:56.950 --> 30:58.311
rest of them, I didn't care. They didn't bother me 
much. Didn't let it bother me, because I figured
