WEBVTT

00:01.516 --> 00:06.480
Sure that you could get water as it's it's hard. 
People will tell you it's Drilling wells and

00:10.696 --> 00:16.843
getting lots of water wells around the stonewall 
area is hard. It's a hard thing to do. Now you take

00:19.106 --> 00:30.879
over here at the boyhood home, that well in the 
front yard is hand dug and I think it's about, well I

00:19.106 --> 00:30.879
don't think I know. When you speak of hand dug, 
define that for me. Well, you just take, you You

00:36.548 --> 00:43.016
take a pick and a shovel and you dig a well by hand. 
Just the straight open pit hole? Yes, but you have

00:45.940 --> 00:53.189
to have it big enough that you can put a scaffold at 
the top and pull your dirt up and out. So they're

00:53.830 --> 00:56.974
usually about six feet across. Okay. Or sometimes 
they may vary in size. And they will be more or less

01:02.114 --> 01:08.824
shaped like a jug when they get down. And they would 
dig underground cisterns in the same way. And we

01:15.515 --> 01:23.907
always had an underground cistern because the 
water stays so nice and cool in the summertime. And

01:23.927 --> 01:26.652
we lots of times wouldn't have water. She depended 
on the windmill. right and if you know anything

01:29.840 --> 01:51.055
about the hill country you find more windmills and 
you do anything else and if you have an underground

01:29.840 --> 01:51.055
system you have cool fresh water all the time yeah 
and but you always have a good filter now that's the

01:29.840 --> 01:51.055
main thing to having good underground system 
water and your filter will be made out at the side,

01:51.473 --> 02:11.284
and you will put a layer of fine sand, a layer of 
charcoal, a layer of sand, a layer of charcoal, a

01:51.473 --> 02:11.284
layer of sand, and it's screened off, and the water 
runs through this, and then it drains into your

01:51.473 --> 02:11.284
cistern.

02:12.546 --> 02:14.629
You don't let the first part of the water run into 
the filter either. It has to be filtered for

02:16.527 --> 02:18.549
purity. You cut the water off, let it rain enough to 
wash all the dirt and stuff off of your shingles,

02:18.649 --> 02:29.682
then you turn it on and let it run through the 
filter. A shower won't do you any good because it's

02:29.702 --> 02:35.649
not clean water. My mother would never make Lysol. 
out of well water. She always used cistern water. I

02:46.585 --> 02:47.526
didn't know that. But still, she made her lye out of 
ashes. And the reason for that is, if she used the

02:53.614 --> 03:06.150
well water, the chemicals from the ash was usually 
made from live oil. And that will not work with with

03:10.297 --> 03:13.141
minerals in the water. So you have a chemical 
backup reaction that it just doesn't do. And she

03:18.107 --> 03:22.433
would use rainwater to make her lye soap. That's 
something else. And she'd never make lye soap in

03:25.597 --> 03:29.202
the decrease of the moon. She'd make it in the full 
of the moon. When the moon begins to fail is when she

03:31.665 --> 03:35.730
would make her soap. She'd never dig her potatoes 
in the and the decrease of the moon because they're

03:38.174 --> 03:44.844
swimming. Is that so? So that's the way she did it. 
That's the way she killed her meat. It's

03:48.669 --> 03:49.170
everything. Everything was done by the moon. By 
the moon. This is an important tradition. Well,

03:54.518 --> 03:55.980
that's been handed down. From generation to 
generation. To generation. And, of course, we had

04:00.066 --> 04:05.094
no calendars. I mean, we had calendars. That's 
true. Well, we had no weather forecast or things

04:07.705 --> 04:12.312
like that. But you listen, and I don't care what 
they say. The first time you hear a Katie did holler

04:16.097 --> 04:21.645
in the summertime, you just mark it. Six weeks from 
that day, it's going to be cold. May not freeze, may

04:24.910 --> 04:28.555
not frost, but it'll dead sure be cool. You'll have 
a cool spell. Okay, six weeks from the first day you

04:31.499 --> 04:36.966
hear the Katie dead, or as we call them, right? Yes, 
sir. Holler, you're going to find out about it.

04:39.989 --> 04:40.930
Okay. And they laugh at you about those things. 
Well, I know that's to be true. And if that sun sets

04:45.816 --> 04:53.546
behind a bank on Sunday night, you'll have some 
kind of precipitation within three days. I see. If

04:55.989 --> 04:59.633
your senesa blooms and in full bloom, You'll have 
some kind of precipitation within five. The

05:02.948 --> 05:05.451
ceniza, that's the... That's purple sage. The 
purple sage, right. The Mexican name is ceniza.

05:09.336 --> 05:10.618
Ceniza, okay. You know, you've heard me say that up 
at the old ranch a lot of times, and they'd come by

05:11.399 --> 05:17.246
and say, well, is it going to rain today? I said, 
well, shoot, you ought to know. Look at the darn

05:19.329 --> 05:21.992
spiderwebs out there on the ground. That tells you 
that it's not going to rain. When the spider webs

05:24.571 --> 05:26.273
are on the ground. That's a sure sign of good old rye 
weather, sister. Is that so? Y'all tell me some

05:32.261 --> 05:33.362
more. These are good ones. Those are just things 
that I just happened to think about. Well, of

05:38.749 --> 05:39.851
course. This is good. They'll ask you about 
fishing. When do they'll say that you can't catch

05:46.359 --> 05:49.583
them? Bass, if they're spawning or if they're 
around their nest and whatnot. And when do you go

05:58.168 --> 06:01.393
fishing for bass? I can tell you one thing. When 
wild plum begins to bloom and it's in full bloom,

06:03.816 --> 06:10.825
you can bet your bottom dollar that your bass are 
going to be out. They're going to be out away from

06:11.886 --> 06:17.173
their nest and they'll be ready to fight you for 
bait. And then you can have very good. And I got that

06:19.116 --> 06:20.177
from... Ruth Perry, so I know that's bound to be 
right. That's bound to be right. That's bound to be

06:25.180 --> 06:27.742
right. That's one of his main sayings. Well, tell 
me a little bit more about the weather, Reba. How

06:33.907 --> 06:35.669
can you tell the weather changes? Well, the best 
thing, one of the best things I've always noticed

06:36.550 --> 06:46.258
is your cattle or your goats or your sheep. You take 
an old goat, and if you're going to have an orther,

06:52.000 --> 06:57.886
You just get out and look at them and see what 
they're doing. Every one of them will hit a beeline

06:57.906 --> 07:02.531
right straight to the north. That wind blows that 
hair right back on their bodies. And they'll hit,

07:10.079 --> 07:16.405
there'll be a bluff or there'll be a shed or 
there'll be something. And they'll go right

07:16.986 --> 07:18.868
straight to it. To the north. They'll face the 
north because that blows their fur back against

07:20.280 --> 07:27.091
their body rather than away where it gets to their 
skin. And you watch a cattle lie down early in the

07:27.131 --> 07:35.143
morning. If they point that head towards the 
north, you know what's coming. There's going to be

07:40.772 --> 07:44.418
cold weather that one of the fronts will be coming 
through. One of the fronts. You just... You watch

07:46.439 --> 07:49.103
your animals, and you'll see. You watch an old hog, 
and they'll go out and gather up sticks and things

07:49.123 --> 08:00.339
and build a nest, or we call it a nest, but build a bed 
in the corner of the pen. When you see them doing

08:00.459 --> 08:04.405
that, you know what's going to happen. What? It's 
going to be colder than Hades. Really? And that's

08:08.651 --> 08:10.995
just as regular as clockwork. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
It's, well... As I say, I was brought up to watch

08:14.367 --> 08:20.985
those things and look at those things. As she says, 
you did not have a calendar, and you didn't have the

08:21.792 --> 08:26.077
6 o'clock news. No, we had no 6 o'clock news. You 
didn't know how you were supposed to behave other

08:29.061 --> 08:33.226
than the way that the traditions had been taught. 
That's right. And do you know, I can remember just

08:34.027 --> 08:39.013
as well if it was yesterday, Hades Comet 1910. Do 
you really? I certainly do. You were a little

08:42.857 --> 08:43.759
thing. I was a little thing, and what happened, we 
were having a country dance, and... Used to,

08:51.188 --> 08:54.114
they'd put you off in a room and you'd go to sleep. 
And I don't know, I guess I just always had a busy

08:54.815 --> 09:03.032
body and had to get in trouble with everything I 
did. I went to the window and I was looking out.

09:08.047 --> 09:37.750
outside and I saw this thing coming with a tail of 
fire like nothing and I screamed bloody murder and

09:08.047 --> 09:37.750
my mother came and I pointed to the window I was 
scared so I couldn't say a word and she looked out

09:08.047 --> 09:37.750
well I'll tell you that broke the damself and 
everybody went to watch everybody went to watch

09:08.047 --> 09:37.750
Haley's Comet of course it didn't last no time but 
it shot across that I've never seen anything

09:38.675 --> 09:40.050
before nor since. But I remember that. I've read 
about it since. Yeah. Because it's frightening.

09:47.573 --> 09:49.316
My father saw that, too. I remember him. And I have 
one other, saw one other comic in my day. And I've

09:54.144 --> 09:58.070
seen the Northern Lights twice, right here in 
Texas. Yes, you could do that this year in Texas.

10:00.554 --> 10:06.043
They've said that from the hill country of Texas, 
at points you could have seen the Northern Lights.

10:06.103 --> 10:08.968
That was predicted in 1981. So when people say 
anything about that, I'll verify that if I could

10:09.252 --> 10:16.120
have come up that night, I would have come up and 
watched them. So let's hear your story. I'll tell

10:17.922 --> 10:22.967
you right now, that is the most beautiful sight 
that I believe that I've ever looked at in my life.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.469
Now, it does not happen. It's a very rare thing. It 
happened one time once before when, let me see, it

10:26.491 --> 10:32.738
was back in the 20s. And we were to go to St. Marcus 
to... a district interscholastic meet and it

10:39.188 --> 10:56.337
rained and was cold and bad and it just rained and 
rained of course no highways nowhere going and it

10:39.188 --> 10:56.337
took all day to drive down there and we'd have to 
stay all night and we were just looking and looking

10:56.570 --> 11:05.482
for every day for it to break off so we knew that we'd 
get to go and take all of the contestants down

10:56.570 --> 11:05.482
there. I was to speak and Margaret was to spell. 
Lyndon was in debating. And, well, I had

11:12.631 --> 11:17.257
extemporaneous speaking and declamation. I was 
in two things. But anyway, we were all to go. And the

11:21.643 --> 11:25.328
night before we would leave the next morning, we 
saw the Aurora Borealis. And we thought the world

11:29.607 --> 11:33.412
was coming to an end. No radios to tell us what it 
was. We had no idea. Until you heard news. Until we

11:39.359 --> 11:42.343
got our semi-weekly express. Semi-weekly. 
Semi-weekly. We didn't have Daily Mail every day

11:45.467 --> 11:52.475
and all that kind of good stuff and found out what it 
was. It just scared us to death. But it was

11:55.039 --> 11:56.260
beautiful. But we thought the world was coming to 
an end. All those lights just came together up in

11:59.187 --> 12:06.597
the center like they looked like it formed a star or 
a rainbow. They go right in the center of the

12:06.977 --> 12:09.381
heavens. Oh, it was the most magnificent thing 
that I believe we've ever looked at. Yes, yes, I bet

12:14.648 --> 12:17.432
it was. It was beautiful. Well, they said you could 
see it this year if you were in the hill country and

12:18.733 --> 12:22.939
it was clear. And that was about three weeks ago. 
Three weeks ago, I think it was. It wasn't as

12:30.279 --> 12:35.089
pretty, wasn't near as good as it was in 1920. No, 
I'm sure, because of the lights. I don't know

12:37.765 --> 12:44.837
whether it was because it was the first time I'd 
seen it or what, but it was much more vivid. The

12:44.857 --> 12:46.920
atmosphere was more pure at that time, too. Yes, 
than it is now. Oh, certainly. It wasn't as vivid.

12:51.288 --> 12:52.309
It was clear enough. You could see it all right, but 
it wasn't as vivid as it was then. Uh-huh. Nothing

12:56.897 --> 12:57.738
like it. I was coming from the ranch. Uh-huh. 
And... when I saw it this time. You know that's

13:04.115 --> 13:08.948
something unusual that you can live to see two of 
them remembered. It is. It is really. Yes, it

13:11.675 --> 13:12.858
really is. But I've lived in the best time that any 
American will ever see. I am beginning to feel that

13:18.050 --> 13:22.316
you may be very close to right. I am right. Now, you 
wait and see. I won't live to see it, but you won't

13:24.419 --> 13:28.084
have as good a time as you're having now. You won't 
have as easy a time. Well, that's the reason I hang

13:28.985 --> 13:33.491
out in this county, because it hadn't... This is my 
favorite place to be. You just... Oh, I told you

13:35.995 --> 13:41.903
about having my picture made with President 
Carter. Yeah, you'll have to tell me about it.

13:45.388 --> 13:47.010
Anyway, what I was going to say... Talking about, I 
remember

13:47.294 --> 13:56.966
the first time I ever went to Austin was to see 
Roosevelt, Rough Riders. Yeah, tell me about

13:57.407 --> 13:58.408
that. Because a lot of people don't realize they 
did visit Austin. Oh, yes, but they did. And they

14:02.834 --> 14:06.098
came down the avenue, right down the avenue. And 
people say, well, now they were stationed in San

14:06.118 --> 14:09.061
Antonio, right? He was trooped up in San Antonio. 
It didn't make any difference. He came down the

14:12.065 --> 14:13.387
avenue. And my daddy took us down there. for us to 
see Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders and we

14:15.830 --> 14:27.162
went in an old Model T car and it took us all day long 
to get there. And we... In what year? Oh, I guess

14:29.965 --> 14:38.935
that... Well, must have been about 19... Must have 
been about 1914, 19... Well, I tell you, it was

14:29.965 --> 14:38.935
Pancho Villa... Right, that's why he was staying 
at war. And it's when he was called in as a trooper,

14:42.317 --> 14:49.426
and my daddy volunteered as a Texas Ranger to go and 
fight in law. I thought I'd never see my daddy

14:49.446 --> 14:51.488
again. And that was then. That was when that was. 
And he was the first dignitary that I ever remember

14:56.514 --> 15:02.021
seeing. And what impressed me most of all of course 
was the way he rode his horse he sat up on that horse

15:05.965 --> 15:31.990
like he was worth a million dollars yeah and he had a 
beautiful horse actually had a beautiful horse

15:05.965 --> 15:31.990
which you would have noticed which i did notice 
which my daddy noticed and oh he was he was such a

15:05.965 --> 15:31.990
proud man to he just sat proud and you see Riders and 
riders again. Some ride on three-fourths of their

15:35.456 --> 15:37.659
backbone. Some give it a slot like this. Never 
erect and never positive. But you could look at him

15:44.289 --> 15:49.536
and tell he was a positive driver. He was a surer. 
Well, he just had that appearance. And that's the

15:54.083 --> 15:58.669
impression he made on me as a child, that he was a 
leader. Mm-hmm. And I believe it to this day. He's

16:01.712 --> 16:03.555
one of my great admirers. Well, now, that was one of 
the first ones. The next one that I met was

16:05.518 --> 16:14.070
President Roosevelt and San Antonio. Now, which 
one? You mean? Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And

16:19.298 --> 16:26.128
from every president on up, I have had the pleasure 
of meeting him. And, well, I met our friend...

16:31.488 --> 16:32.530
Smiley boy.

16:36.756 --> 16:36.936
Who? Our president. Reagan? Reagan. I met him when 
he was governor of California. I met him in

16:43.946 --> 16:48.553
California as governor of California. I had the 
pleasure of meeting him. Face to face. It's

16:52.674 --> 16:55.081
president that I met him before. And, you know, 
that's something else. Of course. And when Lyndon

16:59.473 --> 17:07.755
was inaugurated president in inauguration, 
every governor, of every state or their

17:08.056 --> 17:15.006
representative, lieutenant governor, was 
there. And I had the pleasure of shaking hands with

17:15.466 --> 17:20.994
every one of them and telling them who I was. Isn't 
that nice? Isn't it? Now, let me tell you right now,

17:23.738 --> 17:29.025
it didn't probably amount to anything to them. 
It's just another person. But to me, it meant a lot.

17:34.012 --> 17:34.592
That's of course. It's something that I can tell. 
Of course. and say to my children, and when I was

17:37.587 --> 17:57.710
trying so hard to get my education, and I worked for 
Ms. Sterry as assistant professor in geography,

17:37.587 --> 17:57.710
carrying suitcases on tours for women, checking 
them in their rooms and getting their cases. I went

17:57.730 --> 18:01.835
to every state in the union. On those tours. On 
those tours. Yeah. and work my way in doing things

18:04.199 --> 18:11.126
like that, and then having the pleasure of meeting 
every government. That's something. It sure is.

18:13.844 --> 18:20.073
That not everybody and just a plain old common 
country gal. But you didn't get rich doing it

18:20.253 --> 18:24.239
except in your own heart. That's right. That's 
right. I'm one of the richest people when it comes

18:26.883 --> 18:31.570
to things like that that ever was. Well, I tell you, 
I want to go back and talk some more about that

18:31.590 --> 18:36.577
childhood because that's where it all started. 
You sure did. So let's do that because I'm going to

18:37.498 --> 18:40.703
do a full 90, two 90 minute tapes now on childhood 
alone. I want you to tell me how you got in trouble

18:45.000 --> 18:48.955
with your grandfather some more. Well, 
Grandfather's going to know one day if I wanted

18:50.285 --> 18:54.629
anything from Stonewall. And I said, yes, I sure 
do. I want a pair of little scissors. He said,

18:59.333 --> 19:01.735
honey, what do you want scissors for? Granny has a 
pair you can use. Grandmother says, she's not

19:03.977 --> 19:08.401
taking my scissors and cutting paper with them. 
It'll ruin them. Well, okay, Grandfather goes and

19:10.203 --> 19:13.826
he buys the scissors for me. And he won't know what I 
want. I wanted to cut paper dolls out of a catalog.

19:20.457 --> 19:29.558
And, you know, we didn't have catalogs like we do 
now. But it was a catalog, and they'd have some

19:30.339 --> 19:34.990
colored pictures in them. And you'd cut them out, 
and that's what your paper dolls were. Well, you

19:39.637 --> 19:42.140
can imagine what my paper dolls looked like. He cut 
them out three and four years old. But anyway, I had

19:45.244 --> 19:47.065
paper dolls. Don't think I didn't. Of course, at 
night, my mother would take time enough to

19:48.367 --> 19:55.675
straighten up some of them and fix them for me so 
that I'd have some to play with. And Grandfather

19:55.755 --> 20:01.541
had the most beautiful white beard. And his hair 
was just snow white and curly. He had a steel gray

20:05.716 --> 20:11.764
eye that, oh, it was beautiful. My father had the 
same hazel eye that my grandfather had.

20:19.734 --> 20:21.777
Grandfather was a handsome man. I don't care what 
anybody said about children. Because their

20:26.283 --> 20:31.049
parents, they love them so that they are pretty. 
Well, grandfather was a handsome man. He was

20:33.773 --> 20:35.655
straight as an arrow. He rode a horse like he meant 
to, like he was a proud man, and he was a proud man.

20:43.022 --> 20:51.274
And when he put his hat on, he didn't throw it on the 
back of his head and dip the front down, dip the tail

20:43.022 --> 20:51.274
down the back. He set that hat on, and he didn't cock 
it to one side or this way, but it was straight, and

20:51.755 --> 21:03.432
those sides were just rolled a very little bit. And 
he looked like a million dollars. He always had a

21:07.660 --> 21:10.263
good pair of boots and a good hat. And he'd always 
say that good hat and good boots got you where you

21:10.303 --> 21:17.330
needed to go. And that was true. But anyway, he 
brought my little scissors back. And he was laying

21:22.656 --> 21:25.799
down on his couch asleep. And I'd cut paper dolls 
till I was tired. And I got up and I looked. And I

21:30.925 --> 21:34.228
thought, well, I believe I'll go there. trim 
Grandpa's beard. And I went over and I just got one

21:37.851 --> 21:41.676
whack right about there. And he woke up. And I had 
already cut one whack. Well, he had the heavy trim

21:49.548 --> 21:52.973
the rest of the way. And he talked to me. Oh, I'll 
never forget that talking to. I wished he'd have

22:00.844 --> 22:04.249
spanked me a jillion times, but he didn't. Grandma 
said I needed a spanking, but he just talked to me.

22:10.844 --> 22:13.068
And he says, do you think this is pretty now? Oh, and 
I thought that's the oldest looking man I ever saw

22:13.810 --> 22:19.120
with that big old gap in that beard. And if you'll 
look at the enlarged picture on the wall over at the

22:19.140 --> 22:26.473
boyhood home, you'll still see the gap in the deer. 
Where I put it in there as a child. And it just never,

22:34.691 --> 22:38.097
well it did, it grew out as time went on. But when 
Grandpap had that made, it hadn't grown out. And

22:43.717 --> 22:49.408
that was one thing that I remember above 
everything else. I'd just run the looks of my papa.

22:51.672 --> 22:59.608
And he used to hitch old mold up to the buggy and I'd 
say, make her go fast, let's beat our daddy to

22:51.672 --> 22:59.608
church. And you and your grandfather. And my 
grandfather. And we'd whip her out. we beat that in

23:05.013 --> 23:06.576
the church. Was that the Christadelphian church? 
Yeah, down the river, down the tabernacle, down by

23:09.240 --> 23:20.418
the hodge, the old hodge place, and we'd drive old 
Maude and that buggy down there, and it was all day

23:09.240 --> 23:20.418
preaching and dinner on the ground. Right. And let 
me tell you, you went in that tabernacle, you sat

23:21.540 --> 23:26.548
down, that little church house, In the summertime 
it's a tabernacle and in the wintertime it's a

23:27.760 --> 23:31.845
church house. You sat down on those benches and you 
didn't squirm around and you didn't get up and run

23:31.925 --> 23:38.472
around and you didn't get up and run and get a drink 
of water. You sat there till it was over with. And

23:41.856 --> 23:42.917
that was little. Low, low, low. I never did, I 
thought those Christians would never get through

23:48.223 --> 23:53.408
preaching sometimes. At that age I bet you did. I 
sure did want to go play. So tell me, who taught you

23:58.388 --> 23:59.910
how to rope? Well, really and truly, my daddy did. 
Your daddy did. But I had a good trainer was Sid Hyde

24:04.798 --> 24:10.567
in the brush. And he always helped me with roping. 
And I will say one thing.

24:22.013 --> 24:28.924
gave me better instructions on how to rope in the 
cedar, in the brush, than my daddy ever did. And let

24:29.544 --> 24:41.282
me tell you, this forefinger is the main thing in 
roping, and boy, it guides that rope, it guides

24:29.544 --> 24:41.282
that loop, and if you've got a good, strong 
forefinger, you've got a good loop. So they made

24:42.604 --> 24:45.889
you a cowgirl. They made me a cowgirl, and I 
appreciate that. It means a lot to me now. I'm sure

24:54.293 --> 24:55.094
it does. Being able to do and able to throw a loop in 
the brush, able to throw one outside. That's a

25:01.582 --> 25:05.286
period of history in a unique concept of women. 
Now, we have rodeos, which I know you participated

25:05.647 --> 25:09.051
in later. But my interest is the fact, again, I come 
back to the idea that living on a ranch in Texas.

25:17.421 --> 25:18.042
That's right. you had the responsibility of 
knowing your cattle, and you sure did, and that's

25:18.022 --> 25:24.280
something I want to talk to you about now. You had to 
know your cattle, you had to know what to do, how to

25:24.320 --> 25:27.930
row, How to round them up. Tell me about that. There 
are a few people living today that lived through

25:31.305 --> 25:41.100
the time that we had compulsory dipping in Texas. 
And I'm one of those that did. And the reason for

25:43.244 --> 25:52.238
that, I guess, is this is a thinly populated 
county, as you well know. Yes, it is. It's a very,

25:52.659 --> 25:55.183
very thinly populated county. You didn't hire 
people in those days like they do now. You

25:58.770 --> 25:59.311
couldn't. You didn't have the money to do it with. 
Well, they'd always say, well, we'll get those

26:02.357 --> 26:06.224
three Johnson kids. They're just as tough as they 
ever come when it comes to riding and roping. They

26:10.553 --> 26:11.915
can help us. They'll know over the pasture. Well, 
we would help everybody around. to round up and dip

26:16.865 --> 26:21.413
when it was their time to dip. We didn't have a 
dipping vat there replaced either. This was for

26:24.359 --> 26:27.264
the fly. Well, that was for the ticks. For the 
ticks. That's right. Fever ticks and plain ticks.

26:34.617 --> 26:40.325
We would drive cattle five, ten miles to dipping 
vats and dip them. And we had to know our cattle. We

26:42.909 --> 26:47.695
had to know those that were able to go and those that 
couldn't travel. And Lennon was a good place.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.344
always was with us and helped us. And when I said 
three, there's always four of us. There's four

26:59.609 --> 27:05.398
Johnson kids and sometimes Truman Fawcett would 
help us and he would be down there. And sometimes

27:05.418 --> 27:11.307
the CAMAC girls would be there and help us with 
always somebody to help. I'll guarantee you it

27:11.447 --> 27:13.811
wouldn't be just three. And we'd all have saddles 
and bridles enough to help. But we went as a team and

27:18.018 --> 27:21.583
worked. And that's the way it was. And you could 
look at a cow and say, well, that cow's heavy with

27:24.772 --> 27:31.360
calf. And put her over here. And this cow is a dry 
cow. We'll put her in this pasture. And you'd look

27:38.350 --> 27:44.277
at this one and say, well, we'd better start 
feeding this one. And this one can make it for a

27:44.958 --> 27:48.223
while longer. You could look at them and tell 
whether they could. Well, the cattle look gone

27:51.871 --> 27:53.858
today. What's the matter? Well, they're running 
after acorns. They're going after acorns and

27:57.732 --> 28:04.395
they're not eating and drinking and doing, and 
they'll do that. And lots of acorns, lots of times,

28:04.679 --> 28:09.826
will give cows scours and creeps. Which are? Well, 
the scours are just like a good case of

28:11.528 --> 28:16.414
stomachache. And the creeps is just, it's because 
of the nutrition, the lack of the nutrition that

28:16.675 --> 28:32.155
they should get, and the different types of acorns 
that they're eating, and the lack of minerals in

28:16.675 --> 28:32.155
their food. in the grass that they get. And so what 
does that do to them? You've seen people walk

28:38.390 --> 28:44.398
around that didn't have energy to get along. And 
that's what an old cow does. From eating the

28:47.822 --> 28:49.484
acorns. Eating acorns and old sage grass, bunch 
grass. And you had to know all this stuff. Sure,

28:59.252 --> 29:00.333
sure. And I can remember before we had our dipping 
vats built, the ticks would be so thick on the cow's

29:00.533 --> 29:16.252
udders, as we'd call them bags, udders, better 
word to use, up and down. And you'd put those cows in

29:16.833 --> 29:25.463
a pen, and your daddy would give you a piece of bacon 
rind, about so long, and you'd rub it up and down the

29:26.067 --> 29:32.396
back in that bacon rind, salty grease, and kill the 
ticks. That is right, and that's exactly what we'd

29:33.057 --> 29:39.547
have to do before we had dipping vats. Don't tell me 
that I haven't had it from every angle. I know you

29:42.811 --> 29:43.352
have. You have had it from every angle. That's 
right, when it comes to ranching. Sure, of course.

29:49.160 --> 29:55.770
Then after we had the tick eradication, and then my 
daddy was... had we had made pretty good and was

29:56.830 --> 30:25.943
getting along pretty well and he bought cattle 
cows and calves for 125 dollars oh that was before

29:56.830 --> 30:25.943
everything went to pot in the teens there just 
wasn't anything tell me about that and tell me

29:56.830 --> 30:25.943
about that particular era of time yeah i want to 
know it was Because the cattle days were over. Yes,

30:28.005 --> 30:29.347
they were over. And things went to pot. And the 
government came in and bought up and killed the

30:31.270 --> 30:40.084
stock. Oh, my goodness. I think about that, and it 
just gives me the heebie-jeebies. Well, I don't

30:44.410 --> 30:47.054
think I know what happened at all. You don't? Well, 
there was a law passed that... We had too many

30:54.205 --> 31:08.063
animals and you had to get rid of them and they'd 
kill these calves or cows and just put them out

30:54.205 --> 31:08.063
there and the government did. Do you remember what 
law that was or what act that was? I can't. I'll look

31:12.225 --> 31:12.966
it up. I can't tell you what it was. Just a crazy 
agriculture program that came. An agricultural

31:20.593 --> 31:21.854
program? Yeah. About 19... Well, no, it's about 
1900 and, well, heaven's above. Now, I married in

31:27.699 --> 31:30.582
23 and it was before then. Okay. It was right after 
the war. Well, in the early 20s. Hmm. Early 20s, I

31:38.502 --> 31:42.747
know that because I married in 1923. And I know that 
we took canners and we canned. They put these out

31:50.677 --> 31:54.482
and you'd have to burn them or destroy them. And 
we'd find a real young calf, a tender calf, and we'd

31:55.022 --> 32:05.235
skin it and can that meat to have in the winter to 
eat. Now that's the way, that's the truth if I ever

32:05.857 --> 32:10.942
told it in my life. And they would give you, maybe 
they would allow you one or allow you two. But the

32:19.850 --> 32:24.414
rest of it had to be burned or discarded or done 
something with. I'm fascinated. But that's

32:26.356 --> 32:28.137
exactly right. And then people would come along 
that were hungry and they would get them and take

32:34.898 --> 32:43.772
them and do something out and nothing was said 
about it here because dog eat dog, that's the way it

32:34.898 --> 32:43.772
was. But I do know that I helped Ms. Kamak and we'd 
go, and my mother, and we'd go from place to place

32:45.435 --> 32:56.232
and can to help save it so we'd have something to eat 
in the winter. And that was not because of disease?

33:00.270 --> 33:02.053
No, no, they were just killed. Yes, sir, because 
it's too much. And they were not transporting that

33:03.234 --> 33:05.497
meat anywhere? No, and it's just like plowing up 
our cotton. Ah, making sense. Yeah, it's just like

33:12.625 --> 33:15.508
plowing up our wheat. I know what you're talking 
about now. That's exactly the way the cattle

33:16.670 --> 33:21.756
industry was, and that's exactly what happened. 
And I saw my daddy... Sell those cows that he paid

33:24.308 --> 33:28.976
$125 for a cow and calf. I saw him sell them for 
$12.50. And we couldn't, there was no way that we

33:31.961 --> 33:37.991
had any money to go to school on. That was in the 20s. 
No way. We were down to nothing. And Daddy got a job

33:43.942 --> 33:45.284
then. Absolutely, we just didn't have it. And he 
got a job as tick inspector. And he worked as tick

33:53.247 --> 33:58.669
inspector then for years in South Texas, and they 
finally shipped him. to the King Ranch, and he

33:59.105 --> 34:01.229
worked down there. He did. And there's lots of 
static. And then, boy, they had a lot of trouble in

34:03.895 --> 34:12.332
McMullen County with people dipping and getting 
rid of the fever tick, and he was sent there. That's

34:13.093 --> 34:16.059
another time I didn't think I'd ever see my daddy 
come back. But he did. but now that's and again you

34:21.397 --> 34:42.375
didn't have a telephone where you know real quick 
you sure didn't and you didn't have any well we just

34:21.397 --> 34:42.375
didn't have it money we couldn't have done it 
anyway yeah right i'll tell you talk about chasing

34:21.397 --> 34:42.375
your own rabbits yeah i have You have. I have to eat 
to live. And we'd get, and my father and my daddy, I

34:46.049 --> 34:58.122
learned how to shoot a gun by the time I was five 
years old, and I'm not kidding anybody. And my

34:58.622 --> 35:08.653
grandmother would give me an old dog, old Trigger, 
and she'd say, you and old Trigger go up the holla

34:58.622 --> 35:08.653
now and let's have a squirrel because we won't have 
any meat for dinner. Okay. All right? And I'd go up

35:10.576 --> 35:11.957
the holla. and which was a branch right and there 
would be plenty of old walnuts and plenty of pecan

35:13.102 --> 35:39.835
trees and things and always be squirrels and i'd go 
up to holla and i'd bring back a squirrel for dinner

35:13.102 --> 35:39.835
and she'd make dumplings out of that squirrel and 
that's enough to feed all all those because

35:13.102 --> 35:39.835
squirrel dumplings squirrel dumplings and maybe 
i'd bring back two I never bring over four, but

35:40.760 --> 35:50.855
while I'm out of time, but I'd never bring back less 
than two because two would take that many to feed

35:40.760 --> 35:50.855
us. If I didn't get a squirrel, I'd get a cottontail 
rabbit. Now, I've eaten lots of cottontail

35:54.761 --> 35:59.288
rabbits and squirrels, you bet. And your kids this 
damn time, I wouldn't eat that. I wouldn't have

36:03.975 --> 36:05.738
that. I'm no way. I've eaten squirrels, though. 
Yeah. Yeah. So, but I've eaten lots of squirrels

36:09.228 --> 36:18.197
and cottontail rabbits, baked coon, armadillo, 
deer. What was there? I ate what I had, what we had.

36:24.384 --> 36:25.044
Nothing better. Of course. You lived off the land. 
Lived off of the land is right. And ate what was

36:30.570 --> 36:31.511
here. And I was taught to handle a gun and what one is 
like, a .22. Well, you can look in there at my bed

36:38.236 --> 36:40.198
right now. I've got a gun sitting right at the head 
of it. And I don't... Think anything of it? No,

36:45.684 --> 36:47.787
think nothing about it. So you're still part of an 
era that engaged in self-protection, I would say,

36:47.807 --> 36:56.416
but not in a violent way. Self-protection. That's 
right. You all are for whatever's necessary. And I

37:04.125 --> 37:07.028
enjoy hunting as much as anybody. Yeah, I know you 
do. Right. And I like to... Sometimes I look at them

37:14.384 --> 37:17.768
and I just can't pull the trigger. Yeah. See those 
big old eyes looking at you? I just can't do it.

37:22.896 --> 37:23.917
Better go to H-E-B. You bet. Any old day in the week. 
And then again, they jump in and eat my garden up.

37:29.946 --> 37:32.069
I'm ready to kill them. But then again, I can't. 
Speaking of your garden... I know you don't have

37:36.758 --> 37:39.642
one now, but I know you've always had a garden. You 
and Owen have a garden all the time. You say I don't

37:42.327 --> 37:43.769
have one now. I've got a row of beans right out there 
and a row of radishes and a row of mustard. I spoke

37:48.196 --> 37:48.917
too soon. And a row of onions. They're already up. 
They're already up. Okay, you're full of garden

37:53.944 --> 37:55.507
sin. That's right. Okay, you'll have to tell me a 
little bit about planting. I want to hear about

37:59.353 --> 38:00.274
that. As I told you, I only plant when the sun's 
right. Okay. I plant my cucumbers and plant them

38:04.990 --> 38:11.099
when the sign is in twins, in the arms. Okay, which 
is, I'm not familiar with the signs myself. Okay.

38:15.807 --> 38:19.673
Well, it's the twins. The constellation? Mm-hmm. 
Uh-huh. And that's the way I do that. And I plant

38:24.040 --> 38:33.394
things above ground

38:24.040 --> 38:33.394
in the... the light of the moon and the thing 
growing part of the moon and the things under the

38:34.572 --> 38:48.987
ground and the decrease in the dark of the moon. My 
turnips, I will plant. I haven't planted, but I

38:53.759 --> 38:55.562
will. Because it's the moon's... Moon is bright. 
That's right. Sure. And maybe because I planted

39:01.071 --> 39:06.920
the moon, but I just don't know. It's because it was 
brought up that way. It was the way I was taught. And

39:10.465 --> 39:13.188
that's just the way I do it. Another good sign that 
we were talking about a while ago about weather.

39:17.954 --> 39:26.145
Whenever a ear of corn has a heavy shuck on it, you 
can bet your bottom dollar we'll have a bad winter.

39:26.165 --> 39:33.054
If they have a light shuck, we'll have a mild 
winter.

39:33.074 --> 39:33.855
Pretty well. Are you getting tired? No. How about a 
drink of water? left Germany when the compulsory

39:40.132 --> 39:58.939
military came into being enforced and when the 
Jews were first

39:40.132 --> 39:58.939
cut down. In other words, they were treated worse 
than we ever treated the Negro here in Germany. So

40:08.583 --> 40:15.957
my grandfather had learned the work of being a 
cabinet maker. And he had the tools to do with and to

40:15.977 --> 40:25.815
work with and was a very good carpenter.

40:26.791 --> 40:55.296
this all happened he decided and he told his 
parents that he believed that he would come to the

40:26.791 --> 40:55.296
new land and start all over so he sailed i i wish i had 
remembered we can look this up you know i can do it

40:26.791 --> 40:55.296
well i hope you can because you give me the name i can 
find it on your records if i could find out what boat

40:26.791 --> 40:55.296
that he came on i can find that it's on ship lists but 
anyway and but i do know this that they came in and

40:55.630 --> 41:23.680
must have landed it close to somewhere on the east 
coast near Virginia because grandfather came

40:55.630 --> 41:23.680
across to Tennessee and came down the Mississippi 
River in a flat boat, landed at Galveston, and came

40:55.630 --> 41:23.680
on over to Brenham and helped to lay at the age of 12 
years of age now, mind you, helped to lay the first

41:23.963 --> 41:35.819
railroad dump from Houston to Brenham with 
oxygen. He did that? He certainly did. And that was

41:37.481 --> 41:42.528
in about 18... That was a long time before the Civil 
War. Oh, yeah. Because Grandfather went to the

41:42.989 --> 41:45.172
Civil War. And it's bound to have been back 
about... 18 and 40, 1850, somewhere back in there.

41:56.947 --> 41:58.791
Because he was only 12 years old. But he was a big 
man. Grandfather was a big man. But my goodness

42:04.105 --> 42:08.196
alive, he had that Jew nose. And he was Jewish. Even 
to me. But those were very predominant. But

42:17.728 --> 42:20.051
grandfather never told me any of this. But his 
mother was a red-headed German. And he often told

42:24.616 --> 42:26.959
me. Grandfather had pretty blue eyes, just gander 
blue eyes. And the most beautiful hair that you

42:32.625 --> 42:37.010
ever looked at. Mm-hmm. Now, he was a good-looking 
man, and it was not a bread. It was not a brown. It was

42:45.956 --> 42:48.460
a hazel-colored. Oh, he was a good-looking man. My 
grandmother's hair was as black as a raven, and

42:51.865 --> 42:57.274
when she died, my gray hair won. Her eyes were black 
as bullets. Mm-hmm. But I want to tell you right

43:01.872 --> 43:05.236
now, my grandfather was something else. This 
piece of furniture right here he made. That is

43:08.099 --> 43:08.900
beautiful. And that's beautiful. And cost, I 
could get a pretty penny for that right there. For

43:14.587 --> 43:15.448
that one, yes. A pretty penny. Yes, you could. And 
the bed that he made before he married, I got

43:16.890 --> 43:25.180
because I was the oldest grandchild. And he gave it 
to me. Well, I gave it to Mark because he enjoyed it

43:27.403 --> 43:30.447
more. He enjoys art. And the other children are not 
so well. Well, they're not. They just don't care so

43:38.277 --> 43:40.059
much about it. But now Mark did. And I gave it to him. 
And my grandfather was a twin. And he raised... My

43:49.531 --> 43:54.998
grandmother died with... typhoid fever and there 
were four children and my grandfather was a twin

43:55.720 --> 44:15.585
and his sisters a twin was sisters and her name was 
Clyde Elizabeth and she married a whitest at lamb

43:55.720 --> 44:15.585
passes And you know that name, and you know on your 
tablecloth has Clyde Whitest, which was my

44:15.970 --> 44:28.089
mother's own aunt. And my mother's name was Kitty 
Clyde, named for her aunt, Clyde. Right, so it was

44:35.461 --> 44:40.948
really Elizabeth Clyde, and that's what her name 
was, Elizabeth Clyde. But Mama changed it to Kitty

44:41.569 --> 44:50.661
Clyde because there was a song put out at that time, 
My Sweet Kitty Clyde, and so she changed her name.

44:51.161 --> 44:57.349
But Grandfather raised these children. He moved 
to Round Rock. And from Brenham, he came on up to

44:59.845 --> 45:03.510
Round Rock. I didn't know that. The Chapmans from 
Round Rock. And what year was that? We're going to

45:06.996 --> 45:08.999
get related if you're not careful. Well, I don't 
doubt that a bit in the world, but they came up to

45:09.019 --> 45:13.946
Round Rock. Okay. And long about the time of the 
Civil War, because Grandfather lived from there,

45:14.887 --> 45:29.329
and he left Clyde, that was the whitest, who took 
care of the other two children, and his father

45:29.697 --> 45:38.429
married again. And I know that they have a lot of 
Chapman relatives, but I don't know. Now, there

45:44.237 --> 45:56.194
was one that was Ellick and Betsy and Clyde 
Elizabeth and James Henry. Grandfather's name

45:56.326 --> 45:58.270
was James Henry. So you see how that goes, James 
Henry. That was definitely German. So

46:08.167 --> 46:11.854
grandfather...
