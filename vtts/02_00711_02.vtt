WEBVTT

00:04.722 --> 00:32.468
impressed me so that when I needed an assistant I 
thought about him, wrote him and offered him a job

00:04.722 --> 00:32.468
to come there as an instructor in the mechanical 
engineering laboratory

00:04.722 --> 00:32.468
and it was something that he wanted to do so he came 
and we had a good relationship there he gradually

00:04.722 --> 00:32.468
promoted himself in the department

00:04.722 --> 00:32.468
and then Just like me in the middle 30s, he wasn't 
too happy there. Things changed during the

00:41.896 --> 00:44.500
Depression, you know. If you didn't live through 
it, you didn't know just what the conditions were.

00:49.668 --> 00:55.317
Anyhow, he decided to go to the University of 
Michigan and take some graduate work, and that's

00:49.668 --> 00:55.317
what he did. And they kept him on the staff up there. 
He was just good enough so that they hired him. And

01:01.186 --> 01:02.708
he didn't come back to Kentucky.

01:06.282 --> 01:24.866
In the early spring, early summer, late spring of 
1946, that young man, he wasn't too young by that

01:06.282 --> 01:24.866
time, that I had hired in the middle 20s, called me 
on the telephone.

01:27.429 --> 01:28.611
And he says, Prof. I've got some research work to do 
here which you may be interested in." He knew that I

01:34.513 --> 01:36.355
had been doing research. I had a reputation as a 
research engineer somewhat better than that of a

01:37.576 --> 01:45.825
college professor.

01:45.845 --> 01:47.928
And he said, I've got some research. I thought 
maybe you'd like to help me. And he went on. We

01:53.093 --> 01:54.194
talked about it. It was some work that he had to do 
for the Army Ordnance Department located there in

01:54.915 --> 01:59.340
Detroit. And he offered me a salary. He mentioned a 
salary, which was almost twice what I was getting

02:03.480 --> 02:06.904
at Kentucky.

02:09.908 --> 02:23.765
And since I was beginning to get a little bit tired 
of that work I was doing there for the agriculture

02:09.908 --> 02:23.765
department, couldn't see much future to it, I just 
accepted the job. So I went to Michigan and Ann

02:23.805 --> 02:29.091
Arbor.

02:31.147 --> 02:46.589
When we saw that it was going to take too long to get 
some of the equipment we needed for this research

02:31.147 --> 02:46.589
project, then the department head up there and 
others just got together and they said, well, why

02:31.147 --> 02:46.589
don't we extend this project over a period of two 
years? In the meantime, we'll give O'Bannon some

02:47.250 --> 02:49.794
teaching. So they did that. I got three fifths of my 
salary for teaching and two fifths for research.

02:57.961 --> 02:59.362
That is to say, the M.E. department paid me 
three-fifths of my salary for teaching. That's

03:02.846 --> 03:04.588
two courses of thermodynamics. And the research 
institute paid me two-fifths for doing the

03:05.689 --> 03:09.453
research. And that went on for two years. And it 
took that long to complete the work. I barely

03:15.820 --> 03:16.861
finished it. What was the nature of the work? It had 
to do with what they called vehicular equipment.

03:25.810 --> 03:26.871
It never was spelled out specifically in any of the 
reports it was what the army department labeled as

03:27.914 --> 03:57.060
restricted and the only report that ever came from 
it was the one that i wrote and put into the research

03:27.914 --> 03:57.060
institute there which was transferred to the army 
and if they followed their practice they kept it

03:27.914 --> 03:57.060
secret it retained the lubrication of bearings on 
army tanks. During the war, they would order oil,

04:01.844 --> 04:13.459
and they didn't know whether they would get oil for 
the Sahara Desert or oil for Alaska. They took two

04:14.480 --> 04:24.313
different kinds of oil, and what they wanted to use 
in Alaska, I'm just using that as an illustration,

04:14.480 --> 04:24.313
should have been sent to Sahara, or it wasn't the 
kind of job all they needed for low temperature

04:25.897 --> 04:28.479
operation. And what they got in Africa was the oil 
they needed for high temperature. What they were

04:34.065 --> 04:38.389
looking for was one oil that they could use any 
place over the world. And that was my job. They

04:41.492 --> 04:47.358
would send me all kinds of lubricating oils for 
these bearings on these tanks. And my job was to

04:48.278 --> 04:54.064
find out the characteristics of those oils and 
eventually, if possible, Find one R that could be

04:54.213 --> 04:58.741
used anywhere in the world regardless of the 
temperature. Desert, North Pole, or whatever.

05:02.628 --> 05:03.290
And that I did. That was my job. And I think I did a 
good job. But nobody will ever know because it was

05:07.778 --> 05:10.403
never published. It was restricted.

05:14.089 --> 05:14.891
Army secret. Hey, you left there.

05:23.862 --> 05:27.127
What was the circumstances of your coming to 
College Station? There again, you asked for a

05:27.147 --> 05:29.490
story.

05:32.635 --> 05:34.397
Professor Crawford here was head of the M.A. 
Department at that time. He wrote to the

05:36.080 --> 05:43.210
University of Michigan inquiring about somebody 
up there who'd come here and be on his staff. And his

05:45.233 --> 05:48.858
specifications fitted my specifications. And 
when this friend of mine, who learned about it

05:52.803 --> 05:54.605
indirectly. He called me on the phone. He says, 
prop, she says there's a man down in Texas who's

05:56.347 --> 06:01.452
looking for a college professor. Well, this young 
man and my friend in Michigan knew that I was

06:03.254 --> 06:14.506
beginning to get a little bit tired of research and 
I'd be happy to get back into the classroom. And

06:15.427 --> 06:22.675
what changed my attitude was that those two 
courses, the classroom courses that I taught at

06:15.427 --> 06:22.675
Michigan, which was just an accident, just a 
coincidence. When I did that, I said, never again.

06:28.998 --> 06:30.880
I'm never going to do another bit of research. If I 
can't get a teaching job, I just quit, period.

06:35.167 --> 06:37.790
Well, this turned out to be a teaching job, at least 
I thought it was. So I wrote him a letter, and I

06:38.571 --> 06:41.776
talked to Crawford on the telephone. We talked one 
Monday.

06:47.004 --> 06:49.828
And he described the job, and it sounded good to me. 
And he mentioned the salary, which was about what I

06:49.848 --> 06:52.932
was getting in Michigan. And I expressed some 
interest in it. And he says, well, how soon can you

06:58.605 --> 07:00.507
be here? I said, school starts next Monday. That 
was just a week away. Next Monday? And he says,

07:05.393 --> 07:06.014
yeah. And I says, hesitate a little bit. And I says, 
I'll be there on Friday.

07:12.102 --> 07:17.428
So I met Crawford at the bus station up here Friday 
of that week and started teaching the following

07:12.102 --> 07:17.428
Monday. How long did it take you to get your 
belongings made? I packed a suitcase, and that's

07:22.154 --> 07:24.437
all it was. I left everything else. Didn't bring 
the family. I left everything else. Oh, I see. You

07:30.010 --> 07:31.792
finally stayed in Michigan for a while. Our 
children were in high school there, and there

07:31.812 --> 07:35.656
wasn't any question about bringing the family. 
They had to stay there and finish high school. And

07:38.379 --> 07:42.063
my wife was pleasant enough about it. She agreed. 
And since she knew that I wanted the job, she

07:43.124 --> 07:47.449
couldn't object. So she just says, go on. Get off. 
We'll take care of it.

07:58.268 --> 08:01.151
Late January. After the first term of school 
stopped in Lexington, and our children could then

08:01.311 --> 08:12.942
leave.

08:16.145 --> 08:17.486
Between terms, you see. Your family didn't go to 
Michigan? No, no, the family stayed in Lexington

08:18.567 --> 08:21.770
while I was in Michigan. See, this was just a 
temporary thing up there in Michigan. Oh, I see. No

08:26.095 --> 08:29.320
thought ever of my being there permanently. I knew 
that. Everybody knew that. This was a special job

08:31.583 --> 08:38.533
that I was doing with this friend of mine for the 
Army Ordinance Department. And the only reason at

08:40.456 --> 08:46.906
all that I went was... Well, there were two 
reasons. The first place was the salary.

08:51.472 --> 08:51.833
I had... gotten, like everybody else there, I 
received a cut during the Depression. And if I had

08:59.112 --> 09:05.658
stayed in the engineering college, I probably 
would have advanced money-wise. But since I was in

09:07.060 --> 09:21.955
the agricultural college, where the salaries 
were not quite up to what I had enjoyed in the

09:07.060 --> 09:21.955
engineering college, I was pressed a little bit 
salary-wise. So when they offered me almost twice

09:22.930 --> 09:30.424
what I was making there in Kentucky, I just jumped 
at it just like that. What were your impressions of

09:30.464 --> 09:37.597
coming to Texas compared to what you'd been used to 
in Kentucky and Michigan? What kind of experience

09:37.617 --> 09:40.803
was it to move that far? You mean in the department, 
department-wise? No, I mean just generally.

09:52.782 --> 09:59.408
I had never been to Texas, so I didn't know anything 
about it from personal experience. I had read

10:01.270 --> 10:10.778
about the University of Texas and a little bit 
about Texas A&M University and oil industry in

10:01.270 --> 10:10.778
Houston and so forth and so on. So I wasn't ignorant 
of the state, but I'd never visited it.

10:18.345 --> 10:20.967
And I rode a train from Lexington to Louisville, to 
Dallas. Train got in late in Dallas. I missed my

10:26.785 --> 10:29.269
train that morning to College Station. So I was 
going to have to wait all day in Dallas for another

10:30.551 --> 10:34.737
train. So I got the bright idea about a bus. I saw 
something about a bus. So I thought, I'm going to

10:40.325 --> 10:45.873
just get on this bus and ride to College Station 
instead of waiting all day in Dallas. Longest bus

10:47.015 --> 10:49.418
ride I ever had in all my life. Stopped at every 
crossroad between Dallas and College Station. I

10:53.649 --> 10:55.171
got in here at 7 o'clock. If I had waited and caught 
the train out of Dallas, I'd have had a nice

10:56.012 --> 11:07.850
pleasant stay in Dallas and gotten here at 8 
o'clock.

11:07.870 --> 11:11.415
Professor Crawford met me and he took me to his home 
where I stayed all night. And the next day, which

11:14.160 --> 11:17.785
was Saturday, recommended that I go up around 
North Gate here and look for a room, and I did find a

11:18.136 --> 11:27.706
boarding house up there at the North Gate where I 
lived until my family got here.

11:30.628 --> 11:32.150
That wasn't the question you asked. What was it you 
asked? Well, wait, if you asked about how I like

11:35.393 --> 11:45.223
Texas or something to that effect, well, I'll tell 
you and I'll tell everybody else, there's no

11:35.393 --> 11:45.223
better place in Texas to live than College 
Station.

11:48.629 --> 12:13.287
of the gulf so you get away from all of that 
hurricane high moisture area storms and so forth

11:48.629 --> 12:13.287
from the gulf you're far enough south so you got 
away from all of those northers that run through

11:48.629 --> 12:13.287
there north waco around dallas and fort worth 
you're far enough west so you get away from all that

11:48.629 --> 12:13.287
swampy area over there in east texas western 
louisiana And you're far enough east so you can get

12:13.756 --> 12:17.843
away from all the sandstorms in West Texas. So 
where else can you live that's any better than

12:18.083 --> 12:21.529
College Station? I tell everybody that. So I've 
been happy here as far as that is concerned. What

12:29.522 --> 12:32.046
did your wife think of when she came here? I beg your 
pardon? What did your wife think of moving to

12:32.788 --> 12:35.332
Texas? She just accepted it. She's always been a 
good wife, good mother. And she fitted in here just

12:40.216 --> 12:45.485
fine. She was a very pleasant individual. She 
started going to meeting the wives and going to

12:48.510 --> 13:05.700
bridge parties and women's social clubs and 
church activities and things of that sort. It

13:06.338 --> 13:09.582
seems to have fit in here very well. Was College 
Station very much different from Lexington in

13:09.602 --> 13:12.305
those days? Oh yes, quite a bit different. College 
Station was a country town when I came here. And

13:19.393 --> 13:21.956
that's one of the things I've hated to see change. 
It's grown into a small, gaudy, bocce, pothole

13:22.036 --> 13:30.425
city. It was a nice country town when I came here in 
the fall of 48. You go from here to Bryan, you drove

13:34.840 --> 13:38.504
through a wooded area. You didn't see a house 
except every quarter of a mile or something like

13:39.385 --> 13:45.211
that. It's changed tremendously. When has the 
most tremendous change occurred

13:46.712 --> 13:51.898
since you've been here? Well, the biggest change 
came, of course, after Sputnik in 57. Up to that

13:56.602 --> 14:01.067
time, 57, things... I changed gradually, the 
enrollment increased, there was more building,

14:02.279 --> 14:08.386
faculty increased, and so forth and so on. When I 
came here in 48, I contacted Culpeper Realty

14:08.406 --> 14:18.419
Company, looking for a place to buy, for my family 
to live in.

14:23.024 --> 14:30.413
Their agent could not show me one house in Brazos 
County that I could buy that wasn't an old house

14:31.675 --> 14:47.714
either run down so that the builder was trying to 
sell it or else it was rented at a normal price and

14:31.675 --> 14:47.714
lived in by tenants. There were two little 
two-bedroom houses over there on the east side

14:49.376 --> 14:58.948
across the highway that were built by two 
lumbermen who came from East Texas over here and

14:59.941 --> 15:08.053
built them, thinking that, well, they would be 
able to sell them at a profit. And they didn't sell

15:09.856 --> 15:11.058
them. They were finished in the summertime before 
I got here. I looked at them in September when they

15:15.505 --> 15:18.950
were first shown to me. And they stayed there 
through October and November and December. Long,

15:23.798 --> 15:26.742
I think, is about maybe the latter part of 
December.

15:29.185 --> 15:40.659
After I'd gotten prices quoted to me and so forth, I 
stepped in the Culpepper's office and told them, I

15:29.185 --> 15:40.659
said, I'll give you so many thousand dollars for 
those two houses and the two extra lots. And they

15:42.200 --> 15:43.181
were surprised. So, well, he says, we'll have to 
talk to the owners. So they wrote to the owners in

15:46.545 --> 15:51.611
East Texas and right like that, they came back and 
accepted it. They'd been trying to sell those

15:53.153 --> 15:56.357
houses for two or three months. So I bought two 
small two-bedroom houses, one-bath houses, on

15:57.383 --> 16:05.693
four lots. There's a house, a vacant lot, a house, 
and a vacant lot. And that's where I moved my

16:10.620 --> 16:13.103
family. They moved into that when they came here in 
the latter part of January. You moved into one of

16:18.409 --> 16:19.891
the two houses? Well, we lived in one house, and I 
rented the other. I see. We had moved out of a

16:24.350 --> 16:28.274
five-bedroom house in Lexington, Kentucky. 
Moved all of our furniture here. We had more

16:30.597 --> 16:33.580
furniture than we needed for two houses. So the 
only thing extra I had to buy was a stove for the

16:34.401 --> 16:40.168
kitchen and a refrigerator for the kitchen. 
Everything else we had. We just split between the

16:42.630 --> 16:44.272
two houses. I rented one house. I could have bought 
the whole thing outright for the money I got for our

16:47.916 --> 16:54.103
property in Lexington, but I decided that this was 
a Federal Housing Administration or something of

16:55.147 --> 16:58.012
the sort. FHA loans were very popular in those 
days, and about 4% or 5% interest, something like

16:58.233 --> 17:03.763
that. So I decided to just take out a loan, and I did 
that. And the rent that I got from this second house

17:08.552 --> 17:14.623
paid for the loan.

17:27.344 --> 17:31.832
My experience here on this campus has been very, 
very pleasant. I've enjoyed every minute of it.

17:35.478 --> 17:39.344
You see, because I had a good job doing what I wanted 
to do. It was all, no research whatsoever. That's

17:45.094 --> 17:46.156
another story. As you talk about

17:47.298 --> 17:52.947
1948-64 here, 1948-1964, I was on the teaching 
staff doing nothing but teaching. You did no

17:57.291 --> 17:59.154
research at all during that time? Didn't what? Did 
you do any research at all while you were A&M?

18:03.700 --> 18:04.942
Absolutely none. None? No. The only way I was 
concerned in the least bit with research was when I

18:07.526 --> 18:17.460
had graduate students who, and I didn't have very 
few of those because I didn't care for them. What

18:17.480 --> 18:22.748
did you teach during the years that you were at A&M? 
I always say I taught thermodynamics. That's

18:26.175 --> 18:28.898
really the only thing I ever taught was 
thermodynamics. But I also had other

18:29.299 --> 18:33.303
responsibilities. I had courses in 
refrigeration, which is 95% thermodynamics. I

18:38.949 --> 18:45.716
had courses in air conditioning, which is 95% 
thermodynamics.

18:45.737 --> 18:52.684
And

18:45.737 --> 18:52.684
then after a while, Professor Crawford gave me a 
problem course that he taught to freshmen, which I

18:53.390 --> 19:00.899
enjoyed. But for the most part, ever since I've 
been here, I've been concerned with

19:03.141 --> 19:08.147
thermodynamics. I don't know whether you know 
what thermodynamics is. In the broad sense, it's

19:10.950 --> 19:17.558
defined as the science of energy, which means it 
includes everything. So there isn't anything

19:20.002 --> 19:23.947
that goes on that isn't concerned with energy in 
one way or another. But specifically,

19:24.027 --> 19:38.026
thermodynamics is concerned with the 
transformation

19:24.027 --> 19:38.026
of one form of energy into another form of energy, 
in particular, heat energy into mechanical

19:24.027 --> 19:38.026
energy. That's what thermodynamics is really all 
about. But you can go over to the chemistry

19:40.509 --> 19:44.254
department and get a course in thermodynamics. 
There, they are concerned with heat transfer

19:48.875 --> 20:07.775
energy transformations in chemical processes, 
whereas I was concerned chiefly with the

19:48.875 --> 20:07.775
generation of power, use of gas, oil, coal, to 
produce heat, to make steam, to produce power,

19:48.875 --> 20:07.775
just like you have in a power plant here. That was 
the kind of work that I was primarily concerned

20:07.795 --> 20:14.142
with way back with the U.S. Steel Corporation. 
Were you teaching a separate course in air

20:14.403 --> 20:16.705
conditioning? I had the only course in air 
conditioning. It was just one scheduled class in

20:20.684 --> 20:24.068
air conditioning. When was this taught? Well, 
they started teaching it before I came here. I just

20:29.813 --> 20:30.414
took over. You taught it the whole time you were 
here? I just took over from another professor who

20:31.855 --> 20:38.101
had been doing this work and carried on. I taught 
the course up until I went on modified service in

20:39.062 --> 20:47.350
1959. You don't remember that modified service? 
That's between 65 and 70. Yeah.

20:56.717 --> 21:06.628
You taught three-fifths of time, three-fifths 
pay for three years, and then half pay for two

20:56.717 --> 21:06.628
years. And when you reached 70, you were out. Did 
you do any research in air conditioning while you

21:11.393 --> 21:15.198
were teaching the schools? Here? No. As I say, all 
of my research, most of my research was done

21:17.097 --> 21:23.446
between 1920 and 1948. I quit research after I came 
here to get away from the search. I can't get that

21:34.440 --> 21:36.042
across to anybody. Why did you become 
disillusioned with research? Because of the

21:39.026 --> 21:41.670
length of time that it takes to put into it? The only 
instruments I ever used were temperature and

21:42.528 --> 21:49.034
pressure measurement instruments. Every 
conceivable means of measuring pressure I was

21:49.054 --> 21:52.597
familiar with. Every conceivable means of 
measuring temperature I was familiar with. I

21:56.681 --> 22:03.347
never did any kind of research that didn't involve 
sticking thermometers and pressure gauges on

21:56.681 --> 22:03.347
some kind of equipment. And when you do that for how 
long, 30 years more or less, you get darn tired of

22:03.888 --> 22:11.455
it, period.

22:13.325 --> 22:14.908
I saw two things happen. The research work was 
getting to be more and more less experimental,

22:17.513 --> 22:27.130
which was the kind I was familiar with, and more and 
more mathematical.

22:29.535 --> 22:36.868
In the old days, when I started out and kept it up for 
years, if you had an engineering problem, you'd go

22:29.535 --> 22:36.868
out to the laboratory and you'd set up some 
equipment. and you run an experiment, take some

22:37.726 --> 22:49.361
data, and then you go back to your desk, you start 
studying it, you plot some curves and so forth, and

22:37.726 --> 22:49.361
you find out the solution to the problem. You don't 
do that today. Today, the college professor will

22:51.363 --> 23:05.421
sit down at his desk and start using matrix algebra 
and tensor calculus and differential equations,

22:51.363 --> 23:05.421
analyzing the problem from a mathematical point 
of view. And he may never go into the laboratory.

23:11.786 --> 23:16.012
And he writes that all up and gives to whoever is 
paid for the research. And once in a while, you'll

23:18.315 --> 23:33.254
find some parameter of some sort where you'll have 
to go into the laboratory and run an experiment to

23:18.315 --> 23:33.254
find the value of it before you can substitute in 
these equations you see to get your result. We have

23:33.274 --> 23:36.538
men over there in the ME department, and I guess all 
over the campus, whose own research consists of

23:37.177 --> 23:52.751
mathematics, 99% mathematics, although it will 
pertain to some kind of mechanical or engineering

23:37.177 --> 23:52.751
or other problem.

23:57.176 --> 24:04.062
Well, I hadn't trained myself for that kind of 
research, the mathematical aspect. If I'd have

24:05.138 --> 24:12.047
stayed in research here, I would continue to work 
in the laboratory, which I was trying to get away

24:05.138 --> 24:12.047
from. Now, the other thing that I saw happening was 
the shift from that old-fashioned means of

24:14.029 --> 24:25.063
measuring pressure and temperature that I was 
using to modern electronics.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.049
I came here, I was 54 years old.

24:33.353 --> 24:38.079
And I couldn't see myself trying to learn 
electronics. That was for the next generation. I

24:41.444 --> 24:46.330
was going to get out of research completely and 
turn it over to the next generation. I don't know

24:47.432 --> 24:51.718
whether that makes sense or not. Before you came to 
A&M, did you do any research in air conditioning?

24:57.505 --> 24:59.428
In a way, in a broad sense.

25:08.302 --> 25:16.074
such things as fans, which are essential for most 
air conditioning systems. I ran tests on heating

25:16.094 --> 25:18.959
coils. What was the first air condition? Heat air 
with steam condensing in coils. And I made tests on

25:29.656 --> 25:35.946
unit heaters, which was a kind of self-contained 
air conditioning as you stick under windows and

25:36.550 --> 25:47.285
blow in air from outside, blow it into the room, and 
you heat it or you cool it or you humidify it and so

25:36.550 --> 25:47.285
forth. That's air conditioning. But I never did 
any kind of research on the kind of air

25:49.929 --> 26:03.908
conditioning that you would put in, say, Zachary 
Engineering Building or the Biltmore Hotel in Los

25:49.929 --> 26:03.908
Angeles or some office building in Houston, which 
would run into thousands of tons of refrigeration

26:05.626 --> 26:15.422
and millions of dollars. I never did that kind of 
research. My research was detailed

26:18.386 --> 26:32.148
research that you could, where you could set up an 
experiment in the laboratory, take the data,

26:18.386 --> 26:32.148
analyze the results, write a paper, and so forth. 
I've written, I don't know, dozens more papers

26:33.655 --> 26:39.243
that have been published on the research that I've 
done in that general field. I run tests on the steam

26:40.886 --> 26:51.622
boilers, small steam boilers such as you put in 
buildings which supply steam for air

26:40.886 --> 26:51.622
conditioning heating systems. And I ran a test on 
small underfeed stokers which are used, and some

27:00.166 --> 27:13.502
of them as small as for private residences, which 
often turned out to be part of a larger heating,

27:00.166 --> 27:13.502
ventilating, air conditioning system. See, air 
conditioning itself is sort of a vague term.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.114
It embraces a lot of things. It's just not

27:31.030 --> 27:54.021
and ashtray conditioning includes not only 
control of temperature, humidity, air motion,

27:31.030 --> 27:54.021
circulation of the air, cleanliness of the air, 
and I don't know how many other things, at least

27:31.030 --> 27:54.021
five separate aspects of what we talk about air 
conditioning. Now to one manufacturer air

27:54.041 --> 27:57.966
conditioning may mean nothing more than just 
Maybe washing or filtering the air, something

27:59.532 --> 28:02.897
like that, equipment of that sort. Another 
manufacturer, his air conditioning may include

28:03.979 --> 28:11.570
just the coils that the air runs through to heat it 
or cool it. Another might be just fans. I run tests

28:13.513 --> 28:14.795
on fans. When did you run these tests regarding air 
conditioning? When was this done, your tests on

28:17.779 --> 28:21.124
air conditioning? The kind I'm talking about?

28:31.004 --> 28:33.087
I don't think I want to answer that. I'll start not 
at the beginning, but later

28:33.187 --> 28:39.655
on. I'll start, say, with 1920. Do you know when the 
first air conditioning was invented? Do you

28:46.483 --> 28:46.924
happen to know? Well, I followed the development 
of air conditioning all the way from the time I

28:46.944 --> 28:58.598
entered college as a freshman in 1911, when nobody 
ever heard of the term, right on up until the

28:46.944 --> 28:58.598
present day, you might say.

29:01.531 --> 29:11.266
air conditioning developed over a period of 100 
years, and in particularly a period of the last 75

29:01.531 --> 29:11.266
years.

29:15.372 --> 29:29.293
From the standpoint of the kind of air 
conditioning that you write about and read about

29:15.372 --> 29:29.293
in textbooks,

29:15.372 --> 29:29.293
which is taught in schools today, that kind of air 
conditioning started around 1901 or 1902, and

29:29.813 --> 29:36.641
gradually developed over the years. There was 
what can be referred to as earlier beginnings that

29:38.263 --> 29:45.973
go back decades. But they were all crude 
inventions of one sort or another. But the air

29:54.784 --> 29:56.766
conditioning profession

30:01.977 --> 30:04.522
Carrier, Carrier Air Conditioning Corporation. 
He's known as the father of air conditioning. And

30:08.649 --> 30:10.753
he worked with the Buffalo Forge Company. He 
graduated from Cornell in

30:10.954 --> 30:17.446
I guess 1901. And he

30:17.466 --> 30:25.521
started working at the Buffalo Forge Company in 
that same year. He was born in some western New York

30:27.239 --> 30:31.987
town not far from Buffalo City.

30:34.952 --> 30:36.876
So this was a natural place for him to start. He was a 
farm boy to start with.

30:43.628 --> 30:52.403
At that time, Buffalo Forge Company didn't make 
anything other than fans, I think, just air

30:43.628 --> 30:52.403
blowing

30:43.628 --> 30:52.403
equipment. Fans were used for supplying 
ventilation air to rooms and so forth, and for

30:53.918 --> 31:03.987
heating and so on. You had to have fans to move the 
air, so you talk about fans just like you talk about

31:04.027 --> 31:13.856
a locomotive or a train, you see. It's one of those 
essential things. And that's where he got his

31:16.218 --> 31:18.580
start. And he kept adding on, adding on, building 
on to that, learning more about air. and its

31:24.783 --> 31:51.465
practical uses in various industries, textile, 
paper, and tobacco industry,

31:24.783 --> 31:51.465
and finally into human comfort, hotels,

31:24.783 --> 31:51.465
and dining cars, and places like that. It has had a 
slow, gradual growth throughout the years, right

31:52.677 --> 31:59.086
up to the present time. If you want to know 
something about modern air conditioning, say

31:59.187 --> 32:11.785
since 1964, or even about 1959, you better get some 
young fellow over there in the A&E department to

31:59.187 --> 32:11.785
tell you about it. Because my experience all went 
way back in those early days. Let me change the

32:16.672 --> 32:18.655
subject slightly. What was the change that you saw 
at Texas A&M

32:35.337 --> 32:41.302
It's a continuation of the same change that I 
talked about a little bit ago. The faculty losing

32:42.323 --> 33:01.380
control and the emphasis

32:42.323 --> 33:01.380
changing from seeing the students were taught the 
proper subjects compared to how in the hell are you

32:42.323 --> 33:01.380
going to get the money to pay the staff to teach 
those subjects. I don't know whether that makes

33:01.400 --> 33:04.062
sense to you or not, but it's a switch from 
education per se to the monetary aspects. Now, if

33:12.923 --> 33:33.441
there's any one thing that I object to in those 16 
years that I've taught here between 1948 and 64,

33:12.923 --> 33:33.441
I considered myself primarily a teacher, always 
knew that I was never going to get rich teaching.

33:35.243 --> 33:37.546
That's the only thing I ever wanted to do was to 
teach. There's nothing I like to do better than

33:38.287 --> 33:47.638
stand up behind a desk in front of a group of 
students and tell them something that I think they

33:38.287 --> 33:47.638
ought to know. I get more kick out of that than 
anything I've ever done in all my life. That's the

33:52.924 --> 33:53.905
only thing. I didn't know that until I started 
teaching. But after I did that, I knew that was the

33:57.369 --> 34:02.095
only thing I'd ever wanted to do in all my life. And I 
think I got that from my father and mother. My

34:07.188 --> 34:19.804
father was a physician who was a country doctor

34:07.188 --> 34:19.804
who never got paid for more than half of the work 
that he did from patients. When I looked over his

34:20.966 --> 34:26.793
books when he died, there were tens of thousands of 
dollars of accounts that had never been paid. He

34:28.135 --> 34:32.200
was just a kind old gentleman, country doctor, who 
would wait on anybody and charge them almost

34:33.310 --> 34:39.078
nothing. My brother-in-law was sitting in his 
office, outside his office one day, and he had a

34:39.920 --> 34:47.531
couple in his office. My father had a couple in the 
waiting room. And when they got through and the

34:50.575 --> 34:57.586
patient was leaving, he asked my father, he says, 
how much do I owe you? And my father said, 75 cents.

35:02.639 --> 35:09.427
Man paid the 75 cents, took it out of his pocket, 
found three quarters, I guess it was, gave him 75

35:02.639 --> 35:09.427
cents. My father came out of the office into this 
ante room where my brother-in-law was sitting. My

35:14.494 --> 35:16.596
brother-in-law heard the whole thing. He says, 
Doc, what do you mean charging that man 75 cents?

35:22.464 --> 35:25.748
Well, he says, I knew that fellow. If I'd have said a 
dollar and a half, he'd have said charge it and I

35:26.709 --> 35:31.515
never got another penny. That's the kind of man he 
was. My mother was an ardent church-going person.

35:40.926 --> 35:46.093
There was various women church organizations, 
WCTU, and I don't know what. She was involved with

35:46.113 --> 35:48.376
all of those things. My father was a lay preacher. 
He'd get out into the county and country churches

35:50.298 --> 35:54.223
and deliver sermons. He taught Sunday school 
class. What church? This was a Christian church,

35:58.249 --> 36:00.912
the Disciples of Christ. or sometime known as 
Campbellite.

36:08.573 --> 36:14.400
So that was the kind of home environment that I was 
raised up in. So I never had any ambition to make a

36:14.420 --> 36:17.743
million dollars. My only ambition was, I didn't 
understand this, now you understand. This was all

36:23.670 --> 36:27.955
just stuff that I absorbed unconsciously. But I 
know now.

36:33.950 --> 36:36.973
for people, just like my father and mother were 
doing. And somehow or another, I translated that

36:38.475 --> 36:47.884
in terms of teaching, getting up in front of young 
people and telling them history and so forth. And

36:48.925 --> 36:53.189
that's the only thing I've ever wanted to do all my 
life. And nothing would suit me better right now

36:53.209 --> 37:00.717
than you to take me out here and put me behind a desk 
and talk to a dozen people, you see. Just the way I'm

37:01.085 --> 37:02.472
talking to you now. That's what I've always wanted 
to do. Well, what were some of the changes that

37:05.308 --> 37:08.766
occurred in regard to student violence?

37:22.499 --> 37:33.308
Obviously, you've got to go back through the 50s 
and 60s and 70s and talk about hippies and student

37:22.499 --> 37:33.308
demonstrations and everything of that sort. I 
grew up in that period, just like you did and

37:34.089 --> 37:40.414
everybody else. When I came here in 48, it was the 
war atmosphere, or rather the war being over type

37:42.116 --> 37:51.544
of atmosphere, getting away from

37:53.296 --> 38:11.946
hard duties such as demanded of people in the Army 
and

37:53.296 --> 38:11.946
concentrating on learning something so that you 
could get out into the profession and make a

37:53.296 --> 38:11.946
living. That was the whole attitude. The attitude 
among the students that I saw here after 48, nearly

38:21.224 --> 38:26.591
30 years, was getting a job. Just becoming 
proficient in something so that they could get a

38:27.893 --> 38:34.322
job, hold down their job. Now they were not looking 
for shortcut ways of getting out of doing

38:34.883 --> 38:41.832
something on campus. and having somebody give 
them a job just because they had a degree, they were

38:42.740 --> 38:49.710
actually interested in learning something. 
You'd get up in front of a group of students in the

38:49.730 --> 38:57.661
classroom and you got the impression that they 
wanted to learn what was in the textbook and what

38:49.730 --> 38:57.661
you wanted to teach them.

39:01.827 --> 39:09.658
That gradually, over a period of those 16 years, 
and maybe it's still going on, changed to that damn

39:12.153 --> 39:18.923
degree in any way you can, whether you learn 
anything or not, and get out there and get this job.

39:20.385 --> 39:26.413
It's emphasis on the job and using the degree as a 
ticket to get the job. That was the thing that

39:26.473 --> 39:28.857
became important. Now, when did that change take 
place? I'll give you one guess.

39:36.768 --> 39:39.252
It was when Sputnik was launched. The whole nation 
practically panicked. Look what the Russians

39:42.848 --> 39:44.370
have done. They put this thing up there in the sky. 
They can start bombing the whole nation any time

39:47.194 --> 39:50.458
they wish. We're all doomed to destruction. What 
are we going to do about it?

39:57.667 --> 40:12.687
And on the campus, that reaction was that we've got 
to get some new people, bring in some new

39:57.667 --> 40:12.687
high-powered instructors from outside at any 
price. got to increase the staff, increase the

40:14.354 --> 40:18.180
quality of the staff. That's the important. So 
that we bring ourselves up to where we're even with

40:19.262 --> 40:27.855
the Russians and start developing this new 
technology.

40:32.181 --> 40:37.410
Do you remember anything about the Committee of 
100 or something like that? That began

40:42.637 --> 40:57.781
shortly after 1957, the

40:42.637 --> 40:57.781
AAUP and other organizations on this campus 
started what they called the— The American

40:42.637 --> 40:57.781
Association of University Professors. Yeah. 
What did that—it was the Committee of 100. Their

41:07.055 --> 41:23.635
idea was to go out in the state and find businessmen 
and other people who they thought was interested

41:07.055 --> 41:23.635
in education and had influence among people who 
owned oil wells and other property. And let's

41:25.638 --> 41:34.328
start a new program on this campus here which would 
enhance education bring it up to a higher

41:36.400 --> 41:43.389
standard, increase the quality and so forth, so 
that we could compete with the Russians.

41:46.372 --> 41:49.356
That was the big change that took place. Now you 
can, you yourself and everybody else, can put your

41:49.436 --> 42:06.137
own experience in that attitude,

41:49.436 --> 42:06.137
a switch from knowledge itself to

42:06.877 --> 42:11.362
position.

42:15.106 --> 42:18.249
Using your position to advance regardless of your 
knowledge. I'm not saying that exactly right, but

42:19.671 --> 42:22.654
you get the point, I'm sure.

42:26.638 --> 42:30.462
That kept up and is still going on. I'll go back to 
the moment ago. We were talking about bringing

42:31.744 --> 42:34.707
people in from outside

42:37.268 --> 42:45.036
And when Dean

42:37.268 --> 42:45.036
Calhoun came here. First name? Dean Calhoun. He is 
the chancellor or whatever he is. He came here as

42:53.044 --> 42:59.010
dean of engineering about 55, 56. Do you remember 
his first name? Hmm? Do you remember his first

43:00.791 --> 43:01.973
name? Calhoun.

43:07.002 --> 43:10.527
Oh gosh, just look it up in the catalog.

43:15.895 --> 43:21.523
I should remember his name.

43:25.388 --> 43:29.274
I was on a committee of staff that met once a month.

43:32.378 --> 43:34.461
And about once a semester, we would invite the dean 
of engineering to come talk to us. And

43:40.898 --> 43:51.535
I remember Dean Calhoun was the dean, and he was 
talking to us on various topics. And now he says,

43:51.876 --> 44:01.191
you know, we're going to have to go out and find men 
of high quality and bring them here. put them on our

44:02.183 --> 44:09.435
staff in order to improve the quality of our staff.

44:09.455 --> 44:11.538
That's an insult to anybody on this staff. What's 
wrong with the quality now? Anyhow, that's what he

44:15.064 --> 44:16.326
said, you see. And to improve the quality of our 
staff, we got to go out and bring people in. He

44:23.056 --> 44:28.545
didn't say any particular university, but he was 
thinking about Harvard and Yale and Princeton.

44:29.555 --> 44:34.961
Chicago and other places, bringing faculty. Now 
he says, of course we're going to have to pay them

44:34.981 --> 44:38.846
more than we're paying you now.

44:42.069 --> 44:45.693
Everybody just absolutely quiet, no reaction.

44:48.637 --> 44:49.718
And he went on talking. After a few minutes I spoke 
up and I said, it looks to me like the only way you get

44:51.360 --> 44:57.807
ahead in this business is to change your position. 
Oh, no. He just almost panicked. He could just see

45:03.785 --> 45:11.974
everybody in the room, everybody on campus, 
everybody, staff member in the engineering

45:03.785 --> 45:11.974
corner getting up and going someplace looking for 
a position. He was losing his whole staff. Oh, no,

45:14.036 --> 45:15.358
no, no. I said, you just got through telling us 
about bringing in these people from outside,

45:16.719 --> 45:26.410
bringing them here and paying us more than you're 
paying us now. I didn't tell him this, but he got the

45:27.031 --> 45:29.674
implication. He had just come here to be dean, 
enhancing his position at a higher salary. If

45:38.904 --> 45:56.464
there's anything I object to over the past 5, 10, 
15, 20 years, is my training a student and sending

45:38.904 --> 45:56.464
them out into industry
