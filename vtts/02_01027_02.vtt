Now, I'm sure that you've seen a lot of movies 
recently about Vietnam. How do you feel they

00:11.177 --> 00:13.419
portray the experience? Movies like The Deer 
Hunter and Apocalypse Now and Platoon and Full

00:13.440 --> 00:25.673
Metal Jacket, those types of movies, how do they 
portray what you saw and how do you think that's

00:13.440 --> 00:25.673
experienced? Well, let's see. About ten years ago 
is when I first saw The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse

00:27.495 --> 00:33.902
Now.

00:37.257 --> 00:46.906
I remember going to Apocalypse Now with my son 
Roland one night when I was very tired, and I

00:37.257 --> 00:46.906
remember sleeping through part of it, so I don't 
know that I really ever understood it. But it

00:47.386 --> 00:54.813
seemed to me that it was probably, there was a lot 
more imagery in the movie than truth.

00:59.217 --> 01:05.863
It seemed to me that the movie was about a very 
unusual individual and the ways that he went about

00:59.217 --> 01:05.863
dealing with the problem. and I don't think I 
really know very much about that part of it. The

01:11.424 --> 01:17.532
Deer Hunter, I remember seeing it, and it was a very 
gripping movie. I had been told about it by another

01:17.552 --> 01:30.347
friend of mine who was also a doctor in Vietnam, and 
he described how it made him feel, and then when I

01:17.552 --> 01:30.347
went to the movie, it made me feel exactly the same 
way. And I think the gripping thing about it was was

01:30.388 --> 01:36.475
how Poorly, the American soldier was treated when 
he got back home after he was there doing the best

01:37.636 --> 01:45.284
job he possibly could. His country really treated 
him

01:47.006 --> 01:57.977
almost like an outlaw or something. They treated 
him inferiorly, I believe. They didn't treat him

02:00.780 --> 02:05.145
like returning heroes or returning patriots at 
all. And I think many of the guys like were kind of

02:05.615 --> 02:21.990
portrayed in the movie in terms of drinking and 
other ways of just kind of hiding their disbelief

02:05.615 --> 02:21.990
that their country had sort of disowned them for 
going over there and doing their job. I remember

02:23.351 --> 02:32.820
several scenes I think in the Deer Slayer that were 
very gripping where they were playing Russian

02:23.351 --> 02:32.820
roulette.

02:34.471 --> 02:40.941
And I think that person's mind had already sort of 
degenerated to the point where he really didn't

02:34.471 --> 02:40.941
care whether he came back home or not. He was going 
to make a lot of money if he possibly could doing

02:41.422 --> 02:47.211
whatever he was doing there, and it may not have 
been legal. But, you know, he really didn't have

02:48.593 --> 02:53.801
any desire to come back home, even though his 
friends were looking for him. Did you ever see any

02:55.404 --> 02:57.467
people like that where you were getting on? No, I 
don't think so. I never... I never was around the

02:59.648 --> 03:03.933
bigger cities where people could stay for a long 
period of time. Like in July, I mean, sorry, in

03:04.514 --> 03:19.310
Saigon, there were many civilians who went to 
Saigon and just worked for

03:04.514 --> 03:19.310
companies in building trades and that sort of 
thing. They would stay there for years and I think

03:19.651 --> 03:26.078
many of them maybe began to feel like this and they 
didn't have any desire to come back home at all.

03:26.834 --> 03:34.686
Most of the soldiers I saw were only there for a 
year, and then they rotated back, and I don't think

03:26.834 --> 03:34.686
that they commonly felt quite as badly. Most 
movies seem to be over-portrayed in order to make a

03:35.487 --> 03:45.482
point on certain feelings and that sort of thing, 
and I think Deer Slayer did that. Platoon, I think,

03:46.463 --> 03:56.318
was one of the most accurately filmed movies up to 
its time, and I think it did very accurately

03:46.463 --> 03:56.318
portray the way particularly infantry men, 
looked at the war, how they looked at the

03:57.057 --> 04:17.223
Vietnamese, how they looked at each other, how 
they many times hated their superior sergeant or

03:57.057 --> 04:17.223
captain or major or whoever who was making them do 
things that many times didn't seem logical or

03:57.057 --> 04:17.223
human, humane even.

04:21.688 --> 04:22.449
It's Caitlin, what? Patient Ken Fabisi. Oh, okay. 
Now, while you were over there, did you notice any

04:27.213 --> 04:34.905
of the drug problems, or do you think those came 
about later on, and why do you think that came

04:27.213 --> 04:34.905
about? Well, I have an opinion on it. While I was 
there, I didn't see very many drug problems. We

04:41.475 --> 04:54.334
occasionally would catch a guy smoking 
marijuana, which was illegal, and he would be

04:41.475 --> 04:54.334
given, usually in Article 15, which was either a 
fine or some detention or some extra work or

04:41.475 --> 04:54.334
something like that. The Vietnamese had it though 
all the time and they were smoking it around on our

04:55.327 --> 05:02.014
posts where they were. And I remember numerous 
times smelling it because it had a very stinky

05:02.775 --> 05:07.160
odor. But I never actually saw any marijuana being 
sold or passed around. Once or twice we had some

05:12.106 --> 05:23.038
hoopla going on in a camp when some sergeant would 
think some of his guys were smoking it and we would

05:23.491 --> 05:27.739
have a sneak inspection of their barracks and all 
that sort of thing out of the tents. And I don't

05:28.260 --> 05:31.987
recall where we ever found anything that was 
significant nature. The people that I work with,

05:32.628 --> 05:41.625
though, were very high caliber people and tended 
to have plenty to do and weren't really bored

05:32.628 --> 05:41.625
because we were running a medical facility. They 
were either like nurses, corpsman, x-ray

05:45.327 --> 05:53.899
technicians, medical technicians, or 
assistants to the dentist, or they were cooking

05:45.327 --> 05:53.899
for the unit or something. They were never really 
sitting around with nothing to do. We all had jobs

05:56.943 --> 05:58.666
to do. So I don't think I saw,

05:59.187 --> 06:07.078
saw it more than twice in the six months I was at this 
facility. It was never a problem anywhere I was at

06:07.899 --> 06:13.647
during the whole year I was there because I think 
everybody was busy. And they wanted to be under

06:13.998 --> 06:18.483
control of their own mental facilities. And I 
think a druggie would have been gotten rid of by his

06:18.503 --> 06:25.790
own mate simply because they couldn't trust him 
anymore. And most guys didn't want somebody

06:26.110 --> 06:31.996
around they couldn't trust because it was 
dangerous. And

06:32.016 --> 06:38.663
the war was still actively going on in 68, 69. And I 
think shortly after that, when they were trying to

06:38.683 --> 06:43.768
turn the program over to the Vietnamese, And the 
American soldier didn't have very much to do.

06:46.355 --> 06:48.297
There wasn't very much activity going on. That's 
when the drugs became more of a problem. And that

06:50.799 --> 06:54.964
was a 69, 70, 71 problem. Okay. Now, you know, as a 
mature adult, you've been around, and that's kind

06:55.164 --> 07:10.481
of realized what, you know, do you now think that 
you know a lot more about why you went to Vietnam,

06:55.164 --> 07:10.481
why things were done the way they were, things like 
that? Are you still just kind of? I'm still kind of

07:11.930 --> 07:13.812
in limbo about all that. I don't really know any 
more about it than I did then, even though I've made

07:13.872 --> 07:18.978
some attempts to study it. I'm not sure anybody 
knows why we were in Vietnam. From a medical

07:23.663 --> 07:29.369
standpoint, I was there doing a job taking care of 
the fighting soldier and I did a good job at that. I

07:29.529 --> 07:34.515
liked what I did and I felt good about taking care of 
the fighting men. I saw a lot of activity, both from

07:39.807 --> 07:43.111
the war standpoint and from the medical 
standpoint. And we had extremely good medical

07:43.151 --> 07:45.214
facilities. Our soldiers had as good a medical 
care as there was in the world at the time. And I

07:51.422 --> 08:01.956
still don't have any idea really why we were there 
because it didn't make sense to me while I was there

07:51.422 --> 08:01.956
and it doesn't make sense to me right now either. I 
just don't think we had a real purpose when we went

08:01.976 --> 08:05.621
there. And I don't know what how the decision was 
made to get us started there to start with, but I

08:07.853 --> 08:13.619
think it was kind of ill-founded.

08:16.101 --> 08:20.305
You know, today looking back, do you feel that your 
experience in Vietnam changed you in any way?

08:21.686 --> 08:22.988
Well, probably so. I think my experience in 
Vietnam made me appreciate the United States for

08:23.908 --> 08:28.733
what it is a lot more. I've certainly been much more 
patriotic since I came back. I was patriotic when I

08:33.358 --> 08:35.920
left, but I feel much more strongly that the United 
States is still the best country in the world and

08:36.237 --> 08:45.728
the best country that the world has ever had, 
present on its face actually. I still believe

08:47.390 --> 08:58.262
strongly that the American people are the best 
group of people anywhere and that they can always

08:47.390 --> 08:58.262
be counted upon to do their job when they're asked 
to under the right circumstances. So I really

08:59.403 --> 09:04.489
think it changed me for the good because it helped 
me mature earlier and quicker I think in many ways.

09:09.002 --> 09:31.877
I learned an awful lot there from a medical 
surgical standpoint and I also had a fair amount of

09:09.002 --> 09:31.877
administrative experience there so it really 
helped me be prepared I think to do jobs that I had to

09:09.002 --> 09:31.877
do as a hospital chief of surgery or chief of staff 
or some of the jobs that we had to do as doctors in a

09:09.002 --> 09:31.877
civilian hospital. And I think it was a very 
positive experience for me the year that I spent

09:32.279 --> 09:38.070
there, actually.
