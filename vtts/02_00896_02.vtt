00:02.005 --> 00:16.804
I suppose it was true to the kind of thinking that 
was prevalent in the early planning movement in

00:02.005 --> 00:16.804
the country, and in El Paso as well, that some of the 
elements of the Kessler plan had to do with

00:02.005 --> 00:16.804
aesthetics as much as anything else. Some of the 
thinking in the plan regarding submerging the

00:19.047 --> 00:31.843
railroad tracks that cross the center of the city, 
which had a functional merit in terms of improving

00:19.047 --> 00:31.843
traffic through the downtown and had an aesthetic 
benefit in cleaning up that section of the city.

00:36.824 --> 00:38.967
These kinds of things were incorporated in there. 
For the period in which it was done, it was probably

00:40.430 --> 00:45.658
a wise and a very useful plan. Together with that 
plan, the initial basic structure of the planning

00:46.600 --> 00:57.578
within the city was established with the 
appointment of a plan commission. The city still

00:58.520 --> 00:59.922
retains that name. We have a city plan commission 
as though we had still that one plan that we were

01:00.022 --> 01:03.787
following. I suppose as a shortcoming to that plan 
and to the early planning thinking, there was less

01:05.589 --> 01:22.290
thought given to the overall traffic and 
transportation layout within the developing

01:05.589 --> 01:22.290
areas of the city. And the city went for some time 
without really good articulation of a

01:26.617 --> 01:31.945
circulation pattern.

01:35.150 --> 01:42.883
Furthermore, some of the growth areas of the city 
were not well thought out in terms of how they would

01:35.150 --> 01:42.883
relate to the inner core of the city. The Kessler 
plan spoke very much to the developed area of the

01:43.704 --> 01:53.940
community and tried to enhance the livability of 
aspects of the city as it existed then. The growth

01:54.983 --> 02:09.640
which followed, particularly as the city entered 
that very accelerated growth curve in the 50s,

01:54.983 --> 02:09.640
initially began to move without a lot of good local 
planning thinking. There was borrowing from some

02:09.660 --> 02:17.869
of the kind of subdivision design and such that was 
available and known from other communities, but

02:18.693 --> 02:25.822
it had no signature saying this is the way El Paso 
should develop. It certainly was not being guided

02:25.922 --> 02:31.409
by the central management of the city government. 
I think probably the most significant thing that

02:32.670 --> 02:43.544
happened during the period of the 50s and early 60s 
was the beginning of the articulation of a

02:32.670 --> 02:43.544
circulation pattern within the community. The 
designation of certain streets as major

02:43.624 --> 02:48.430
thoroughfares, the planned extension of them, 
the incorporation of standards regarding

02:49.439 --> 02:57.751
useful and necessary right-of-way widths and 
paving widths. As a shortcoming to that thinking,

02:59.714 --> 03:06.243
all those standards could be listed in plans and 
plan documents. I think although there was a lot of

03:08.627 --> 03:14.535
contribution made to the city's development in 
the way of The thinking on the transportation

03:15.933 --> 03:41.094
system and the street network, you could 
criticize that whole period as to say that due to

03:15.933 --> 03:41.094
politics, due to funding limitations, due to 
inability to coordinate development among

03:15.933 --> 03:41.094
different governmental jurisdictions, notably 
the city and the school district, many things kind

03:15.933 --> 03:41.094
of went their own way. There was not a good program 
to acquire park park sites. There was not

03:47.797 --> 03:58.789
development

03:47.797 --> 03:58.789
of a good neighborhood concept with the 
relationship of a school and park space and

03:47.797 --> 03:58.789
residential areas. There were many shortcomings 
and probably during the period of the post-war

04:01.272 --> 04:13.125
growth boom began, a long certain highways that 
served at that time as the almost sole

04:13.696 --> 04:19.545
transportation route. The inevitable 
development of strip commercial

04:19.625 --> 04:43.180
uses, the strip commercial pattern that

04:19.625 --> 04:43.180
today, I realize this is practically true to any 
city, but it always seems terribly unfortunate,

04:19.625 --> 04:43.180
the hodgepodge pattern of commercial uses on 
small lots and their signs. It speaks very poorly

04:47.849 --> 05:12.357
of a city's image of itself and it perhaps would be a 
valid criticism of the thinking during that

04:47.849 --> 05:12.357
period that the body politic didn't see reason to 
try to arrest the ugliest parts of those

04:47.849 --> 05:12.357
developments and create a more pleasing 
community image that would be evidence from

04:47.849 --> 05:12.357
traveling along those highways. This was the 
immediate post-World War II era. Immediate

05:14.965 --> 05:24.980
post-World War II era that saw doubling the 
population of the city and some of the most land

05:14.965 --> 05:24.980
extensive development that the community had 
ever seen at that time. And then when the street

05:26.443 --> 05:34.415
pattern became involved with the interstate 
system. The interstate system surely has to be

05:34.435 --> 05:38.881
this and any other community, I'm sure. It has, it 
changed It changed everything. Carving up

05:46.384 --> 06:05.833
neighborhoods, defining new transportation 
routes, creating intersections of importance

05:46.384 --> 06:05.833
and enabling the city to grow in directions that 
never had done so before because of the increase in

05:46.384 --> 06:05.833
travel time.

06:07.028 --> 06:27.352
When we look at planning in any community, we have 
to think of the decisions made by those

06:07.028 --> 06:27.352
transportation types that lay out interstate 
highways and decide where the interchanges will

06:07.028 --> 06:27.352
be and realize that their decisions have probably 
more long-reaching implications than much of

06:07.028 --> 06:27.352
what's done by what we term the real planners. It's 
more, I guess, the planners have to understand and

06:28.854 --> 06:36.883
fully realize the implications of such things All 
too often, I suppose no one really does, at least

06:37.403 --> 06:50.022
during that period, as the interstate system 
began to be implemented in the late 50s, that the

06:37.403 --> 06:50.022
far-reaching implications of it were not fully 
thought out. Although I don't think the city

06:50.042 --> 06:52.405
suffers so much from that. The interstate system 
in particular opened up the east side of El Paso,

06:52.806 --> 07:06.246
the upper escarpment, a very flat desert mesa that 
overlooks part of the Rio Grande Valley. It opened

07:07.154 --> 07:14.142
it up, and today it still continues to outstrip the 
rest of the community in its growth. Because of its

07:15.804 --> 07:23.794
more recent development, it does have a 
relatively well-articulated street network

07:15.804 --> 07:23.794
arterial pattern. As I noted earlier, it has 
rather dearth of open space.

07:33.682 --> 07:36.725
In many ways, I suppose it looks like every other 
community. There still is not a true southwestern

07:36.745 --> 07:43.751
or El Paso signature on that development, as there 
could have been. Going back for a minute to the

07:44.291 --> 07:55.881
Kessler plan, Mike, my reading of it surprised me 
because he doesn't talk about land use patterns.

07:55.901 --> 07:56.602
No, he doesn't. No, he doesn't. It's circulation, 
including the railroad and parks and so forth, but

08:04.192 --> 08:11.141
in terms of basic land use patterns, it's absent. 
No, it's rather unfortunate that even when the

08:11.462 --> 08:20.533
city first established zoning ordinances and 
such, there didn't seem to be a lot of very weighty

08:11.462 --> 08:20.533
thinking given to land use patterns. The initial 
charge, which was given to the city planning

08:21.334 --> 08:33.270
commission, which was created shortly after the 
Kessler plan was created, spoke almost

08:21.334 --> 08:33.270
exclusively of overseeing public investment. 
the capital improvements the community would

08:33.588 --> 08:38.656
make, and to assure that they fit within the plan. 
And it doesn't really speak to the role of the

08:38.736 --> 08:49.832
commission as a body recommending to the elected 
leaders changes in the pattern of the community's

08:38.736 --> 08:49.832
development from a land use perspective. And that 
was probably the vacuum which created

08:50.814 --> 09:01.249
development patterns which we now look back at and 
use terms like blighted and such because it It

09:02.461 --> 09:06.605
wasn't properly controlled in that period. One 
thing I wanted to ask you about particularly is the

09:06.625 --> 09:16.254
work that you did when you were in the planning 
department on the Secundo Barrio.

09:19.296 --> 09:31.928
South El Paso, I'm sure some of the other 
interviewees have talked about the planning that

09:19.296 --> 09:31.928
was done during the Chamazal boundary 
relocation. It's just been mentioned, but not in

09:32.279 --> 09:35.343
any detail. It might serve as an introduction to 
the South El Paso problem. The Rio Grande River

09:42.373 --> 09:49.082
forms the international boundary. By the Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, it is the boundary between

09:51.446 --> 09:55.852
the United States and Mexico. It follows the 
center line of the river. As the river changes and

10:00.089 --> 10:16.928
shifts course, the boundary moves with it with two 
provisions, whether that change is created by

10:00.089 --> 10:16.928
accretion, the slow movement and change of the 
river channel, or whether it's created by a sudden

10:00.089 --> 10:16.928
shift, in which case the boundary remains 
unchanged. And it appears that in the 1860s, more

10:16.948 --> 10:25.658
or less, there was a flood that through avulsion, 
that sudden change or shift of the river's course

10:26.600 --> 10:33.410
should have changed the international boundary. 
However, the United States failed to acknowledge

10:33.690 --> 10:35.333
it. It remained at a sore point between the United 
States and Mexico for many years until the Kennedy

10:36.234 --> 10:48.852
administration, when the administration chose 
to try to address that problem. It became a rather

10:48.932 --> 10:55.662
unique situation in first physically relocating 
the river second massive acquisition of

10:56.367 --> 11:03.715
properties on the US side to then be ceded to 
Mexico. And in the course of that, although there

11:04.956 --> 11:24.197
was, I suppose, I don't remember the numbers 
exactly, I think approximately 450 acres of land

11:04.956 --> 11:24.197
in the United States was ceded to Mexico and 
another 250 to 300 acres from Mexico became part of

11:04.956 --> 11:24.197
the United States. This was in the very center core 
of the city, an area that land values and

11:24.717 --> 11:30.743
development patterns were very intense.

11:33.546 --> 11:53.205
There was an opportunity on the part of the United 
States to make use of the land acquired to create

11:33.546 --> 11:53.205
some, a number of things were done, improvements 
in the transportation pattern through the

11:33.546 --> 11:53.205
beginning of the first leg of a highway 
paralleling the river. The acquisition of open

11:54.248 --> 12:09.145
space that today is the Chalmazal Memorial and the 
site of many important community events in the way

11:54.248 --> 12:09.145
of festivals for one thing or another and drama 
theaters and such. The improvement bringing up to

12:10.907 --> 12:24.222
standard the relocation of a high school that was 
in a very crowded congested site that offered

12:10.907 --> 12:24.222
little in the way of outdoor play area and It today 
is fully compatible with any of the newest high

12:24.674 --> 12:37.545
schools in the city in terms of its quality, in 
terms of the amount of space that's devoted to it,

12:24.674 --> 12:37.545
splinters of land that became available for 
public housing. A number of different things were

12:38.746 --> 12:43.911
done there on the land acquired from Mexico on the 
U.S. side that was good and notable. On the land

12:44.391 --> 12:52.378
that was ceded to Mexico, however, there was 
massive relocation necessary, the relocation of

12:44.391 --> 12:52.378
literally thousands of people. This is... The 
land that was involved in this immediately

12:54.796 --> 12:57.699
parallels the border. Historically, it's been 
the site of housing for some of the poorest

12:58.680 --> 13:12.634
residents of the city, persons who have Hispanic 
heritage, persons who still have ties, family

12:58.680 --> 13:12.634
ties and economic ties with Mexico. Although 
stereotypes are always dangerous, it could be

13:13.735 --> 13:22.103
stereotyped to say that certain neighborhoods 
within there represent, in essence, first

13:22.572 --> 13:26.756
generation of the newer immigrants, 
particularly from Mexico.

13:30.060 --> 13:52.242
These are persons who had the ambition to come 
across, whose skills and education limits them in

13:30.060 --> 13:52.242
terms of their economic ability, but they retain 
many of the kind of attitudes of what a

13:30.060 --> 13:52.242
neighborhood should be from their Mexican 
heritage, and it tends to be very close-knit

13:52.660 --> 14:01.834
neighborhoods with intricate social 
organization, people whose associations are

13:52.660 --> 14:01.834
determined based on who lives in the next three 
blocks. From a sociological perspective, this

14:03.597 --> 14:13.872
probably are the only two neighborhoods in El Paso 
that people really tend to interrelate as a

14:03.597 --> 14:13.872
sociologist believes they should. Well, it was 
right in this area that mass relocation was

14:16.636 --> 14:20.963
necessary. There

14:21.938 --> 14:51.422
were things done during that period that, at the 
insistence of John Cunningham, the then city

14:21.938 --> 14:51.422
planning director, that assistance be provided 
beyond the basic minimum compensation that the

14:21.938 --> 14:51.422
constitutional mandate would give for persons 
who had to be displaced, particularly those

14:21.938 --> 14:51.422
renters, to ensure that we didn't take a man of 
limited means and suddenly throw his life you

14:51.976 --> 14:56.725
know, totally out of whack and do more harm than 
anything else to the individual. In any case, this

14:58.489 --> 15:04.040
relocation was accomplished in a relatively 
short period. And what followed then was a very

15:05.362 --> 15:12.837
sharply defined border along the area that 
between the downtowns of El Paso and Juarez, there

15:14.335 --> 15:23.509
remained this neighborhood that is just 
generally referred to as South El Paso, or

15:14.335 --> 15:23.509
sometimes Segundo Barrio, Segundo meaning 
second. It was the second ward back when the city in

15:23.589 --> 15:33.544
its early days had five voting wards, barrio being 
a Spanish term for neighborhood. The

15:34.786 --> 15:43.819
housing patterns in there that had not been 
touched by the channel relocation of the river,

15:44.103 --> 15:53.858
were some of the most intensively developed and 
populated sections of the city. Tenements

15:55.120 --> 16:02.151
remained there from that period I spoke of earlier 
when the Mexican Revolution was going on and there

15:55.120 --> 16:02.151
was a massive influx of citizens. Tenement 
buildings that offered two rooms and no indoor

16:03.373 --> 16:10.785
plumbing,

16:03.373 --> 16:10.785
typically two-story brick buildings. that very 
tightly spaced together. I suppose all in all, in

16:15.548 --> 16:22.380
that half square mile of the community that's 
called South El Paso, there was a population of

16:15.548 --> 16:22.380
roughly 25,000 people. And that density may not 
seem... To understand that density, you also have

16:23.662 --> 16:34.080
to understand that you'd seldom find a building 
over two stories anywhere in that area. This was a

16:34.300 --> 16:37.245
case of people packed together not only on the 
land, but within the physical confines, the rooms

16:37.462 --> 16:45.031
they lived in, the rooms of their dwelling units 
and everything else. Everything was very tightly

16:45.111 --> 16:47.875
packed.

16:49.517 --> 17:06.017
In the early 70s,

16:49.517 --> 17:06.017
spurred on in part by a change in some federal 
programs, there was a move on the part of the city to

16:49.517 --> 17:06.017
address the housing problem in there. the 
particular change in the programs I speak of, the

17:06.773 --> 17:15.161
public housing, which the city initially had 
several public housing units built. There had

17:15.861 --> 17:19.685
been very little new public housing built in the 
city for some years. The mandate from the

17:20.706 --> 17:35.059
Department of Housing and Urban Development was 
that the city would have to adopt a housing code,

17:20.706 --> 17:35.059
number one, and have to adopt it in a real sense by 
having a workable program for such code

17:20.706 --> 17:35.059
enforcement. to arrest the blight and 
substandard housing conditions that existed.

17:42.556 --> 17:48.063
Who took the leadership role in providing public 
housing in El Paso, would you say?

17:51.688 --> 17:52.629
I couldn't honestly say. Where did that begin? 
What was the pressure for it?

18:03.895 --> 18:24.930
I couldn't honestly say whether it came from the 
administration or within the planning

18:03.895 --> 18:24.930
department or within the housing authority which 
had been in existence now for almost 15, 20 years

18:03.895 --> 18:24.930
and exactly where the pressure came to diligently 
go after the funds that were available for new

18:03.895 --> 18:24.930
public housing. I know that part of the El Paso's 
never had a redevelopment agency. No, the Urban

18:29.398 --> 18:36.506
Renewal Authority has been put before the 
citizens on three different occasions and

18:29.398 --> 18:36.506
suddenly defeated on three different times. And 
yet it's had a housing authority for quite a while.

18:43.233 --> 18:46.536
It had its earliest housing unit, I think, traces 
to 1948. Again,

18:47.778 --> 18:52.903
I can't really answer your question where that 
initial impetus to pursue the public funds

18:53.542 --> 18:58.428
available for where new housing came from. But I do 
know that the charge then to make it work fell onto

18:59.189 --> 19:11.023
city staff, two departments, notably the public 
inspection department and the city planning

18:59.189 --> 19:11.023
department. It was determined, a policy 
decision, it was determined that that code

19:11.043 --> 19:21.996
enforcement would be concentrated in south El 
Paso, the area that was known and acknowledged to

19:11.043 --> 19:21.996
have the worst housing conditions in the city. 
Kessler noted that in his plan as well. It's been

19:24.788 --> 19:26.892
around the city for a long time. And it still 
exists. It still is a problem in that area. The

19:32.179 --> 19:43.136
attitude of the public inspection department was 
to make an inventory of the housing stock in there

19:32.179 --> 19:43.136
and select the worst housing units for 
demolition. And this was somewhat at odds with the

19:44.017 --> 19:48.203
thinking of the city planning staff who thought it 
better to Since if you simply want to categorize

19:49.162 --> 20:14.926
what does not meet code, 80% of all the structures 
down there would be outside of not in code

19:49.162 --> 20:14.926
compliance, but rather to concentrate in given 
areas where the land that would be made available

19:49.162 --> 20:14.926
for new development based on the demolition then 
could constitute big enough parcel sizes to allow

19:49.162 --> 20:14.926
for useful redevelopment. The city planners 
didn't win out on that. The code enforcement

20:17.709 --> 20:19.050
people did. I

20:20.026 --> 20:25.875
do not know the numbers right off hand. There were a 
number of these housing units, these tenements,

20:25.895 --> 20:29.560
which were destroyed. There are people relocated 
into public housing, which, in keeping with the

20:31.223 --> 20:45.204
thinking of the day, was

20:31.223 --> 20:45.204
trying not to concentrate persons through public 
policy and assisted housing. These housing units

20:45.804 --> 20:49.510
were scattered across the city.

20:50.806 --> 21:00.481
There were a number of things the planners at the 
time were rather upset about, but the

20:50.806 --> 21:00.481
pressures were all coming from somewhere else. 
The public housing officials, the code

21:00.541 --> 21:08.694
enforcement people, as I said, wanted to target 
what they considered to be the worst housing

21:00.541 --> 21:08.694
units. It created a pattern like a pox across the 
neighborhood where lots sometimes as little as 25

21:09.495 --> 21:16.847
feet wide and 125 feet long. became available. 
They were vacant, but they were still built up on

21:18.139 --> 21:20.343
either side. There was really no opportunity for a 
redevelopment based on these parcel sizes that

21:20.363 --> 21:28.516
were being made available. The relocation 
patterns of the residents, there was really no

21:28.536 --> 21:39.274
thinking about what was going on there in the way of 
taking a very intricate social network that

21:39.777 --> 22:00.356
existed in that neighborhood, a true 
sociological neighborhood, as I pointed out

21:39.777 --> 22:00.356
earlier, and trying to preserve that intact, 
where persons with

21:39.777 --> 22:00.356
social ties would be relocated to areas that would 
enable them to maintain those social ties, or

21:39.777 --> 22:00.356
relocated as groups. Rather, this was in keeping 
with national standards. The elderly were put in

22:04.619 --> 22:08.603
elderly housing, and families were put in family 
housing, And it began to destroy part of what the

22:09.308 --> 22:16.756
Hispanic neighborhood, which was more of a 
mixture of different age groups. With their

22:16.816 --> 22:20.640
particular institutions. Exactly. And in some 
cases, these public housing units which were

22:22.762 --> 22:33.574
created in here, it really didn't accomplish the 
federal mandate at all of trying to deconcentrate

22:22.762 --> 22:33.574
the minority groups. There were public housing 
units. We're talking about families with numbers

22:36.173 --> 22:43.124
of children and something that there was no 
private housing which would meet their needs. The

22:43.965 --> 22:50.816
public housing which was necessary for this often 
was four and five bedroom units typically within

22:43.965 --> 22:50.816
the complexes. And some of these multi-bedroom 
units were constructed in complexes located in

22:52.138 --> 23:03.295
otherwise distant locations, elite 
neighborhoods, but lacking walking distance to

23:03.612 --> 23:19.990
shopping, lacking good public transportation, 
and built in concentrations of sometimes as many

23:03.612 --> 23:19.990
as 600 units, which we began to multiply the units 
by the number of bedrooms, by the potential

23:03.612 --> 23:19.990
population. There are complexes which easily you 
have over 1,500 people, all relocated from the

23:20.090 --> 23:29.400
same basic area. which now becomes an enclave of 
poverty in otherwise a neighborhood that sees no

23:29.802 --> 23:35.668
relationship with it. The social integration 
hasn't been accomplished because of this. But

23:39.011 --> 23:59.252
what happened in south El Paso is that where the 
attitude had always been rather passive in terms

23:39.011 --> 23:59.252
of the role of the government as it affected their 
livelihood, an attitude of don't make waves, the

23:39.011 --> 23:59.252
militancy began to emerge among the 
neighborhood. They had seen, through public

23:59.890 --> 24:11.864
policy, their neighborhood cut the population in 
half with the result of scattered vacant parcels

23:59.890 --> 24:11.864
all through the neighborhood. They had not seen 
good and wise development come in to follow it.

24:18.672 --> 24:24.278
Rather, sometimes the remnants of foundations 
left on there, it became just a opportunity for

24:25.422 --> 24:36.033
other kinds of social problems of petty crime and 
gathering places for vagrants and such. They knew

24:36.053 --> 24:50.507
of their family members who now were relocated to 
distant parts of the city and were living in far

24:36.053 --> 24:50.507
superior housing but were completely unhappy 
because of what had happened to their lifestyle

24:36.053 --> 24:50.507
and lifestyle pattern. And it was in 1975 more or 
less that at the instruction of John Cunningham, I

24:56.793 --> 25:18.836
worked with some of the staff in trying to once 
again prepare a study and a program of

24:56.793 --> 25:18.836
improvements for the area to try to address the 
problems of, particularly the ongoing problems

24:56.793 --> 25:18.836
of the continued magnitude of the substandard 
housing and concentration of the poor that exist

24:56.793 --> 25:18.836
in South El Paso. And what we encountered was 
considerable resistance from the neighborhood.

25:24.680 --> 25:33.015
Suspicion that there was really a secret plan to 
remove all the residents, that we really wanted

25:24.680 --> 25:33.015
just to commercialize all of it. We didn't care 
about their needs. Contrary to federal mandates

25:35.860 --> 25:46.780
about social integration and relocating the poor 
to better class neighborhoods to encourage, as I

25:35.860 --> 25:46.780
said, social economic integration, These people 
didn't want to leave, and they made that point as

25:47.367 --> 26:00.706
many times, that they were quite happy with the 
neighborhood that existed as it existed, and they

25:47.367 --> 26:00.706
wanted the housing problem addressed as it 
existed. I think as a young intern working on my

26:00.866 --> 26:13.864
degree, I was down here and I was encountering the

26:00.866 --> 26:13.864
trenches of citizen participation for the first 
time. Didn't find a very placid, meek population

26:14.249 --> 26:23.520
sitting down there and waiting until 
presentations were concluded to then politely

26:14.249 --> 26:23.520
ask questions. I was working with small groups 
that were shaking their fist and walking out of

26:23.600 --> 26:33.452
meetings and making threats. And people were 
quite unhappy. And also, maybe I began to see some

26:35.614 --> 26:43.243
of the weakness of meetings per se as I I began to 
encounter that there were different attitudes in

26:43.544 --> 26:47.108
the neighborhood. There were some very militant 
youth groups that would make as though they

26:47.148 --> 27:12.454
represented all the people in the area, who in fact 
didn't, but they would lobby very effectively at

26:47.148 --> 27:12.454
public meetings that were held to make it seem as 
though the overall consensus of the neighborhood

26:47.148 --> 27:12.454
was in keeping with their particular notions of 
what should happen.

27:14.189 --> 27:15.730
As I said, I was here on an internship. I didn't see 
even that particular program to its completion. I

27:21.656 --> 27:24.378
saw the different elements as they began to come 
together. And later, when I worked with the

27:25.599 --> 27:34.688
planning staff again, the programs had different 
names and things of thinking. The problems never

27:35.589 --> 27:37.030
really changed. But it's taken a long way to come 
around to it was finally happening. through a

27:44.564 --> 28:00.644
combination of perhaps less conservative 
thinking on the part of our local attorneys who had

27:44.564 --> 28:00.644
real great problems with any public money being 
spent to benefit a private citizen in the way of

27:44.564 --> 28:00.644
housing, rehabilitating housing. Changes in the 
way of federal monies that became available

28:01.866 --> 28:06.672
through the Community Development Program. Just 
changes of those that they seem, of no great

28:11.463 --> 28:13.807
significance, but had great significance to us. 
The funds that we had available for improving the

28:13.907 --> 28:21.481
neighborhood almost entirely were limited to 
doing the things that we did need to do. Improving

28:22.262 --> 28:33.261
drainage and parks and putting more street lights 
and well that's all fine and good, but the problem

28:22.262 --> 28:33.261
was and always is and always was housing. Terribly 
substandard housing. Clearly the what was

28:37.433 --> 28:43.662
necessary wasn't a continued wholesale 
destruction of a neighborhood and relocation of

28:37.433 --> 28:43.662
persons to distant parts of the city. And finally, 
only in more recent times, a number of different

28:45.024 --> 29:07.356
programs come about where instead of tearing down 
units and building our monotonous public

28:45.024 --> 29:07.356
housing, we're making money available so that 
different organizations, be they private

28:45.024 --> 29:07.356
landlords, property owners that can go in and 
rehabilitate housing, different nonprofit

29:08.129 --> 29:18.788
corporations made up of one notable organization 
I can think of is a group of ex-students from the

29:08.129 --> 29:18.788
local high school, the Bully exes, they call 
themselves. How do you spell that? Bully, as in

29:21.132 --> 29:26.461
Bully High School, named after Jim Bully, 
ironically. I can tell you stories about Bully

29:26.481 --> 29:32.652
High School, too, and its social significance in 
the area, but I mean, as a group of persons, an

29:33.155 --> 29:53.725
ex-students association composed of persons who 
grew up essentially in that neighborhood coming

29:33.155 --> 29:53.725
back and acquiring tenements and renovating them 
into standard units and then together with

29:33.155 --> 29:53.725
management contracts with public housing making 
them available at subsidized rates so they

29:33.155 --> 29:53.725
continue to be affordable for the people there. 
Money that we've supplied to non-profit

29:55.307 --> 30:00.715
corporations which have created They have built 
new housing and remodeled housing and then sell it

30:01.387 --> 30:15.025
on a, it becomes, rather than a condominium, it 
becomes a co-op of housing where you have an

30:01.387 --> 30:15.025
undivided interest in the whole complex. We've 
been able to do, I think, more good in the area that

30:17.107 --> 30:27.040
way than anything else by not going in there and 
thinking we have to tear it all down and build it in a

30:17.107 --> 30:27.040
model of something that in our middle class minds 
we see is the way a neighborhood should look but

30:28.015 --> 30:55.390
taking the resources that already exist, good 
stable brick buildings which have lasted for 50

30:28.015 --> 30:55.390
years and taking them, remodeling them, making 
them into carving standard housing out of them and

30:28.015 --> 30:55.390
working with the programs that are available to 
keep them affordable for the people that would

30:28.015 --> 30:55.390
choose to remain in the area and So that perhaps, in 
a sense, the complexion of the area hasn't

30:56.804 --> 30:59.728
changed. Appearance-wise, things have not all of 
a sudden been drastically altered. But what we've

31:03.713 --> 31:08.600
done is finally go in there and address the housing 
problem that really exists. And it's a long road to

31:08.620 --> 31:11.604
hoe in it. There's still many, many tenants down 
there that don't meet any codes that you could

31:11.624 --> 31:19.254
think of anywhere.

31:23.199 --> 31:25.562
We're beginning to finally make a dent in it, 
though. Like I say, it'll be many, many years

31:25.964 --> 31:51.853
before we can even think we've finally really come 
close to an end, but I think we're finally moving in

31:25.964 --> 31:51.853
the right direction, and maybe as an indicator of 
that, what I encountered in that neighborhood in

31:25.964 --> 31:51.853
the way of militancy and resistance is more or less 
gone away, and there's more of an attitude of trust

31:25.964 --> 31:51.853
and cooperation now as we finally have a housing 
program which is seen by all parties as being

31:25.964 --> 31:51.853
responsive to the neighborhood's needs. Does the 
planning department have Spanish-speaking

31:52.998 --> 31:59.888
planners as liaison to that project? Very 
definitely, very definitely. In fact, I was one of

32:01.550 --> 32:08.500
the few people that was allowed down in the 
neighborhood that couldn't speak Spanish.

32:08.520 --> 32:20.457
Something which, on a very different subject, 
we're talking about different

32:08.520 --> 32:20.457
categories of thinking that have planning 
significance in El Paso. One element that's only

32:22.057 --> 32:33.056
beginning to unfold right now is a change of the 
attitude of the community regarding the

32:22.057 --> 32:33.056
mountains, which bisect the city. These poor 
mountains have been ravaged for all kinds of crazy

32:34.378 --> 32:44.416
things from almost time immemorial. People have 
had the craziest notions of building giant clocks

32:48.027 --> 32:51.931
on top of them and roads right down the ridge line 
and one thing or another. It wasn't a lot of

32:51.991 --> 32:56.596
attitude on the part of the city of really caring 
for the mountains. All in all, the rough terrain of

32:57.057 --> 33:03.244
the mountains, it didn't allow for a lot of 
development. It didn't allow for the properties

33:04.105 --> 33:10.311
to be developed economically. And so outside of 
the high school's pain there, their school

33:15.618 --> 33:22.126
initials on the mountains, and radio towers 
putting their transmitting towers on top of the

33:15.618 --> 33:22.126
mountain. Not a lot happened on the mountains 
themselves, and they remained pretty much as they

33:22.426 --> 33:29.234
always had been. Well, land development 
techniques change over time, and more recently

33:30.015 --> 33:40.027
the development of some very difficult terrain is 
becoming economically feasible. People that

33:42.230 --> 33:44.933
would be inclined to do so would provide a market 
for elite housing that offered a spectacular view

33:45.740 --> 33:54.228
by being built into the mountain itself. And 
there's been a growing awareness on the part of the

33:55.649 --> 34:08.801
community that the mountain, almost every inch of 
it was privately owned and not protected from

33:55.649 --> 34:08.801
anything that could happen. This led some years 
back to the acquisition politicking on the part of

34:16.655 --> 34:28.090
the local legislators from the El Paso area to 
encourage the state to acquire much of this

34:16.655 --> 34:28.090
mountain and designate it as a wilderness park. 
And this, in fact, is being done. But there remains

34:32.196 --> 34:44.552
much mountainous terrain, particularly in the 
southernmost third of the mountain that lies

34:32.196 --> 34:44.552
within the very densely developed core of the city 
itself that is still in private hands, that there

34:45.342 --> 34:53.535
is a growing development pressure for it. And I 
find it noteworthy in the sense that through a lot

34:53.556 --> 35:12.126
of meetings and studies and the adoption of 
ordinances and now continuing changes to the

34:53.556 --> 35:12.126
ordinance, the city is beginning to try to do 
something which can't be readily borrowed from

35:13.388 --> 35:16.351
just any city anywhere. And that's to define if the 
mountain areas are developed, how should they be

35:16.411 --> 35:21.777
developed? How can we preserve the character of 
the mountain yet still allow the terrain to be

35:21.797 --> 35:29.526
developed? The city has never, they've only 
recently incorporated site plan review as a

35:30.927 --> 35:42.400
condition of billing permit as part of their of 
certain zoning classifications.

35:47.185 --> 35:48.607
We have to go. Come on. In any case,

35:51.691 --> 36:09.197
some planning thinking is having to be put to focus 
on a problem which is rather unique to communities

35:51.691 --> 36:09.197
such as El Paso that do have mountains terrain that 
is intended and can be developed. And it's created

36:09.869 --> 36:20.066
a new challenge for some of the planning staff 
which was accustomed to studying plans on

36:09.869 --> 36:20.066
two-dimensional maps to have to begin to think 
three-dimensionally.

36:22.389 --> 36:36.973
So many of the physical implications of 
development patterns and what that does to the

36:22.389 --> 36:36.973
aesthetics and livability and all the other 
physical implications that go along with

36:38.118 --> 36:48.169
Drainage patterns and traffic patterns are 
beginning to have to be looked at quite

36:38.118 --> 36:48.169
closely. General principles can be identified, 
but the specific standards have been very

36:48.229 --> 36:53.615
elusive. The staff is only now beginning to come up 
with some workable solutions. It's not something

36:58.741 --> 37:04.267
which I can point to in the city and say, look at what 
has been accomplished. I'd rather only highlight

37:04.387 --> 37:06.690
that as something that is ongoing right now. And I 
don't have a lot of good examples of ordinances and

37:09.717 --> 37:16.364
policies which have been adopted. I can show you 
maybe some of the bad examples and mistakes that

37:16.424 --> 37:19.267
have been made. But I think it's interesting from a 
planning perspective only in that it is a

37:19.307 --> 37:33.842
relatively unique situation that the kind of 
planning I think is best, a very localized

37:36.117 --> 37:51.834
an individual kind of solution has to be sought so 
that you apply not the standards that you get out of

37:36.117 --> 37:51.834
national publications, but the principles that 
govern planning to bring them to bear on a unique

37:36.117 --> 37:51.834
and very community-oriented problem. We've 
already mentioned Kessler and Cunningham. Are

37:56.440 --> 38:03.427
there any other major personalities that have 
affected planning in El Paso? Mayors or planners

38:05.497 --> 38:33.563
themselves

38:05.497 --> 38:33.563
private groups

38:05.497 --> 38:33.563
I can't really give you a chronology of the 
different personalities that have been involved

38:05.497 --> 38:33.563
in the directorship itself outside of the more 
recent period when I knew John Cunningham and

38:05.497 --> 38:33.563
interim director Bill Adams and now current 
director Nestor Valencia

38:05.497 --> 38:33.563
there have been Have there been any private 
citizen groups that have been influential in

38:34.471 --> 38:41.199
supporting planning? El Paso remains a city that 
community groups, neighborhood organizations

38:42.881 --> 38:54.515
and such, they spring up usually on an 
issue-oriented basis. They have one particular

38:54.555 --> 39:03.786
axe to grind, and all too often they disappear once 
that issue, the immediate crisis, is passed. And I

39:04.137 --> 39:21.513
think there would have been, there would be a lot 
more interesting examples of good planning had

39:04.137 --> 39:21.513
there been the pressure from the community and the 
neighborhood organizations on an ongoing basis

39:04.137 --> 39:21.513
that unfortunately has been lacking all too 
often. No continuity. Not really, not really.

39:24.375 --> 39:34.144
That continuity, the lack of continuity of 
leadership within the community itself rather

39:24.375 --> 39:34.144
than of elected, of city officials themselves. is 
perhaps something that's held back plenty.

39:44.389 --> 39:48.676
Although you have had a series of mayors who have 
been very supportive of planning. Yes, on

39:48.696 --> 40:01.617
occasion we've had mayors, some very 
conservative, who had the attitude that federal

39:48.696 --> 40:01.617
money was tainted with tainted money and should be 
avoided at all costs. The most important thing was

40:02.474 --> 40:15.474
to hold down taxes and never pass a tax approval, 
and consequently there were very few in the way of

40:02.474 --> 40:15.474
capital improvements done either through 
locally generated revenue or through program

40:02.474 --> 40:15.474
monies available through the federal 
government. There have been other mayors who took

40:16.916 --> 40:19.921
a more active role. Mayor Judson Williams

40:20.522 --> 40:29.916
comes to mind as a person who was really interested 
in seeing some of the elements of the city progress

40:31.162 --> 40:35.467
in terms of planning and thinking. I believe he was 
the mayor during the period of the Chamazal Treaty

40:35.527 --> 40:41.794
being hashed out.

40:45.579 --> 40:56.511
All too often, though, I think the, like I said, 
it's a parochial and rather conservative city,

40:45.579 --> 40:56.511
and so there's not been a lot of, the citizens 
themselves don't give a strong mandate to the

40:56.710 --> 41:23.933
elected leaders to pursue different planning 
goals and consequently the leadership hasn't

40:56.710 --> 41:23.933
hasn't pushed new planning directions frontiers 
taking a look at the future what do you think are the

40:56.710 --> 41:23.933
major problems that el paso planning is going to 
have to address

40:56.710 --> 41:23.933
water usage water it has to be one of the most 
critical issues in the city We've covered that in

41:24.250 --> 41:26.312
other interviews. Any other issues?

41:34.061 --> 41:46.875
I would think one thing that has to be faced up to

41:34.061 --> 41:46.875
is the changing complexion of the city from an 
economic standpoint that has rather negative

41:34.061 --> 41:46.875
implications into the future. The city is 
becoming increasingly a manufacturing center.

41:54.490 --> 42:03.401
And increasingly, the white collar staff, the 
headquarters operations

41:54.490 --> 42:03.401
are disappearing. There's a real danger that the 
city can become one dimensional in the future in

42:04.042 --> 42:18.220
the sense of having too many industries that 
employ apparel industries, for instance, that

42:04.042 --> 42:18.220
employ people that need no more training than 
necessary to sew zippers on blue jeans and too

42:18.622 --> 42:46.637
little of the management staff in the future this 
may create in essence a leadership vacuum as the

42:18.622 --> 42:46.637
persons with the greatest incomes are the plant 
managers for the large national companies who owe

42:18.622 --> 42:46.637
no local allegiance to the community are here only 
as a stepping stone to other positions and to And

42:47.613 --> 42:56.624
then, of course, your problems with Mexico and the 
two economies rubbing shoulders every day. It's

42:56.844 --> 43:12.743
been one thing that has been very successful in 
this area, the Maquiladora program, the twin

42:56.844 --> 43:12.743
plants that enable industry in Mexico to work with 
industry in the United States to do parcel

42:56.844 --> 43:12.743
assembly of items, electronic components, and 
such, that later then are shipped into the US for

43:14.950 --> 43:20.155
export. Different tariff laws and things like 
that that are changed to allow for this. It's

43:23.319 --> 43:38.094
created giant industrial parks on the Mexican 
side that have improved the standard of living in

43:23.319 --> 43:38.094
lettuce in particular, and have created their 
counterpart development in the United States, in

43:23.319 --> 43:38.094
El Paso in particular. We see some of the final 
assembly. We see, of course, a lot of warehousing

43:40.356 --> 43:44.721
and such. That, in a sense, is rather positive. It 
is provided, although it is creating other

43:47.644 --> 44:11.535
population pressures by virtue of continued 
immigration of some of the rural area Mexicans to

43:47.644 --> 44:11.535
the urban area around Juarez with hope of getting 
their slice of the economic pie, which never grows

43:47.644 --> 44:11.535
as fast as the population seems to. Any other basic 
issues that are going to have to be faced by

44:14.300 --> 44:23.694
clients?

44:24.795 --> 44:39.717
I think El Paso, like many cities, we're finally 
beginning to see a slowing down of the peripheral

44:24.795 --> 44:39.717
fringe of the community and a reawakening of the 
value of some of the built up areas of the

44:24.795 --> 44:39.717
community. and the real public concern over some 
of the old neighborhoods with their Corinthian

44:40.405 --> 44:52.998
column decorated homes that are being destroyed. 
And it's a challenge from a planning perspective

44:53.058 --> 45:06.632
of how to redevelop and how to renew and how to 
restore some of the quality of life in the built-up

44:53.058 --> 45:06.632
area of the city has just a totally different 
social makeup than when it was originally

45:07.372 --> 45:11.517
created. It's not as easy to point out areas in El 
Paso where you find the so-called

45:11.577 --> 45:17.504
gentrification. You find more areas that the 
homes have been subdivided into, grand old homes

45:18.465 --> 45:33.683
have been subdivided into five apartments, and 
the complexion of the neighborhood now is

45:18.465 --> 45:33.683
entirely a Hispanic community of very modest 
economic means, and it's beset with problems of

45:34.270 --> 45:39.757
crime and the air pollution which hangs over the 
city, yet there's a physical resource there which

45:34.270 --> 45:39.757
is being lost. And there's a genuine community 
concern over trying to salvage that. And you've

45:46.766 --> 45:57.621
got to realize the economics and social fabric 
that exists there now and see how that can best be

45:46.766 --> 45:57.621
integrated with the physical resource which does 
exist. That would be a planning challenge now and

45:57.741 --> 46:02.607
into the future.

46:06.046 --> 46:07.872
Ed, thanks very much. If you can think of anything 
to add to this when we get the transcription to you,

46:08.856 --> 46:16.202
feel free to add or delete. Thank you very much.
