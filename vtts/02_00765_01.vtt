WEBVTT

00:06.700 --> 00:17.780
my first question is how did you get

00:06.700 --> 00:17.780
interested in athletics well my brother got me 
started in athletics

00:17.760 --> 00:37.520
there was a man who came

00:17.760 --> 00:37.520
to my element brother stayed after school he was to 
work out with the team and he picked the people he

00:37.500 --> 00:44.440
got a sister who wants to run we always like we had 
elementary

00:44.420 --> 00:59.480
school relays and relay races in school he told him 
the coach about me and says so that's really how

00:59.460 --> 01:17.530
you're doing

00:59.460 --> 01:17.530
with the boys against

00:59.460 --> 01:17.530
girls at that at that point i think we're pretty 
much

01:17.510 --> 01:48.890
this particular

01:17.510 --> 01:48.890
coach

01:17.510 --> 01:48.890
uh carl

01:17.510 --> 01:48.890
robbins i don't know why i never had a coach that 
didn't push you i had a

01:48.870 --> 02:24.750
good experience

01:48.870 --> 02:24.750
yeah

01:48.870 --> 02:24.750
so i think it's

01:48.870 --> 02:24.750
kind of good

01:48.870 --> 02:24.750
did you ever

01:48.870 --> 02:24.750
compete in any other sports

02:28.610 --> 02:47.460
in high school we i'm not really that old but we 
really didn't

02:28.610 --> 02:47.460
have any

02:28.610 --> 02:47.460
but the only athletic programs that we had so i

02:47.440 --> 03:03.720
really

02:47.440 --> 03:03.720
just picked track and stuff i may have been 
different and

03:03.780 --> 03:19.160
i have played half a quarter

03:03.780 --> 03:19.160
women choose sports which they prefer or should 
they choose sports choose those sports which are

03:19.140 --> 03:34.750
more popular such as gymnastics if

03:19.140 --> 03:34.750
they're

03:19.140 --> 03:34.750
gonna want to go as a matter of

03:35.530 --> 03:58.660
fact to get phone calls

03:35.530 --> 03:58.660
but she's also good obviously the girl has a lot to 
say always go with the thing you know different

03:58.640 --> 04:08.060
levels of competition if you're trying to go to the 
top level you've got to do something that you're

04:08.040 --> 04:18.890
dealing with professional sports for women 
tennis and golf concerning the professional

04:18.870 --> 04:23.900
level why do you feel women have made less money in 
individual sports and why are women's

04:23.960 --> 04:28.620
professional teams struggling and oftentimes 
fail i

04:28.600 --> 04:58.900
don't really

04:28.600 --> 04:58.900
know why we bought in different sports as far

04:28.600 --> 04:58.900
as track full-scale entrainments a lot of times 
the men will scale against the men's events it's

04:58.880 --> 05:08.290
getting better but when i was running it wasn't i 
don't know why

05:08.270 --> 05:28.620
because the people enjoyed

05:08.270 --> 05:28.620
it maybe it's just the fact that the women

05:28.600 --> 06:07.630
and

05:28.600 --> 06:07.630
they'd probably pay it if they'd be struggling 
oftentimes

05:28.600 --> 06:07.630
no a lot

05:28.600 --> 06:07.630
of attention

06:07.610 --> 06:12.030
star female female athlete you've probably 
experienced many things which non-athletes

06:12.010 --> 06:17.290
girls did not experience did you ever feel you were 
treated differently from your peers in terms of

06:17.270 --> 06:28.200
dating social activities and interactions with 
non-athletic

06:17.270 --> 06:28.200
females uh it's real hard for me in high school 
probably in high school it wasn't that big deal

06:28.180 --> 06:39.330
because i ran from my father to get to high school 
and even girls from other schools if you're good

06:39.310 --> 06:51.010
you're hated you know it's always that way if 
you're pretty you're hated if you're popular

06:50.990 --> 06:55.170
you're hated you know and that's the way it was for 
me i i was popular within my school because i was

06:55.870 --> 07:04.710
cheerleader varsity cheerleader stuff like that 
so i i got some things that lets me know that i was

07:04.690 --> 07:12.040
popular but i was disliked by you think

07:12.740 --> 07:30.020
that was the sole reason you made me of the girls who 
disliked me

07:49.480 --> 08:12.740
i mean there were a lot of girls that i didn't like so 
i never said very

07:49.480 --> 08:12.740
very

07:49.480 --> 08:12.740
much i think a man will respect another man when you 
get to college but women for some reason

08:32.900 --> 09:02.890
value

08:32.900 --> 09:02.890
did athletics

08:32.900 --> 09:02.890
teach you what do you feel people should gain um it 
teaches you i think that's

09:02.870 --> 09:32.950
the biggest

09:02.870 --> 09:32.950
considered by their male counterparts as serious 
athletes there's some reason i do at a m now it may be

09:32.930 --> 09:55.070
different in other schools

09:32.930 --> 09:55.070
and at a m it seems like

10:13.560 --> 10:17.260
despite all of your accomplishments i found very 
little information on you in both the local

10:17.240 --> 10:22.700
newspaper and the battalion do you feel you 
receive your just recognition as an athlete and do

10:22.680 --> 10:24.860
you think that you would have received more of your 
a

10:24.840 --> 10:53.850
man oh

10:24.840 --> 10:53.850
i probably

10:24.840 --> 10:53.850
got more publicity the big picture in the paper i 
was in there quite often and i don't think i was i

10:54.390 --> 11:06.210
felt like at the time i compared me to a male of a 
similar quality

11:14.290 --> 11:25.410
every every newspaper whereas i might get an 
article in there just right after the track but

11:25.390 --> 11:57.400
jerry

11:25.390 --> 11:57.400
wagner but it wasn't after i made the olympic

11:25.390 --> 11:57.400
team which i was the ultimate goal for me we

11:57.380 --> 12:31.640
went

11:57.380 --> 12:31.640
to

11:57.380 --> 12:31.640
washington

11:57.380 --> 12:31.640
and really

12:31.700 --> 12:55.030
this one guy was a wrestler that

12:31.700 --> 12:55.030
i

12:31.700 --> 12:55.030
was whereas i

12:31.700 --> 12:55.030
didn't really get it probably less publicity 
after made

12:55.010 --> 13:06.750
the team we were talking about him as a track ass 
leader you got a lot more of the track no well well

13:06.730 --> 13:14.680
once track season started he did it was never 
ending thing for him because he

13:14.660 --> 13:25.990
was really putting football on track okay the 
title ix section of the equal rights of men or 72

13:25.970 --> 13:32.070
guarantees women equality with men in all areas of 
athletics did you at any time feel the women's

13:32.050 --> 13:38.130
athletic program at texas a m was treated equally 
with the men's athletic program in terms of

13:38.270 --> 13:43.090
housing, scholarships, equipment, or benefits? 
As far as housing, no. I was on full scholarship,

13:47.460 --> 14:06.840
and

13:47.460 --> 14:06.840
boys rowed at King Hall, and my husband played 
football for me.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.741
I would say definitely no. I think it's better than 
it was at any other marvelous facility. When

14:15.950 --> 14:21.700
I was at A&M, we didn't have pride. I think A&M is 
trying to have the best women's program of any of

14:21.680 --> 14:26.960
the schools, and

14:26.940 --> 15:04.170
I think they

14:26.940 --> 15:04.170
probably

14:26.940 --> 15:04.170
do, which I think, I would probably complain that 
the big gray on the

14:26.940 --> 15:04.170
bus is on the men's. If we're comparing the women's 
track team to the men's track team, I would say we

15:04.150 --> 15:12.140
should compare us to the football team.

15:16.280 --> 15:29.460
A lot of women will compare all the men's teams, but 
even the men's team don't get it. I'm pretty

15:29.540 --> 15:30.921
level-headed in that. I've always had proper,

15:30.900 --> 15:45.050
definitely there's a little bit.

15:51.680 --> 15:57.360
As a result of the Title IX, there was a tremendous 
increase in the budget of women's athletics at

15:51.680 --> 15:57.360
A&M. During your years here, the budget increased 
from $104,000 to $420,000. Was the increase in the

16:03.260 --> 16:06.020
budget evident to you during your years here? The 
first year, I was the only one on

16:07.200 --> 16:37.340
scholarship, and of course then it was separate

16:07.200 --> 16:37.340
coaches. So I thought that was really 
interesting. And it was real hard for the men to

16:42.360 --> 16:50.090
accept some of the men that were on there were only 
getting books and tuition, and they'd compare

16:50.430 --> 16:53.990
their stuff to this other girl over here who was on 
there.

16:58.520 --> 16:58.844
So. You could definitely tell, and the coach got a 
bigger increase. So you could definitely tell

17:03.170 --> 17:07.680
when they came in.

17:10.670 --> 17:14.630
From its inception, most colleges in the NCAA have 
been against Title IX. They argued that an equal

17:15.030 --> 17:21.190
funding of men's and women's athletics would be an 
economic disaster for college athletics. Do you

17:22.130 --> 17:26.830
feel this is a viable reason to disallow women an 
equal opportunity with men to enjoy athletics?

17:30.810 --> 17:35.800
Well, I know that some of the schools, you know, 
they don't want it. I

17:35.940 --> 17:39.980
don't think that's the case. I

17:40.140 --> 17:47.180
know some of the schools. Some of the schools are 
that way. I think that they

17:49.080 --> 17:55.650
need to accept it.

18:00.930 --> 18:04.230
I can't believe that they're having that problem 
now. When I graduated, it was kind of tough. When I

18:09.840 --> 18:12.430
was like, but it's been long.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.801
University of Houston, for example.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.521
I don't think that he... Women

18:29.500 --> 18:50.420
groups have fought for the separation of women's 
athletics from men's. They feel the only way for

18:50.580 --> 18:55.600
women's athletics to prosper is for women to run 
their own programs. In 1982, the NCAA ended the

18:56.140 --> 18:58.600
AIWS. The NCAA ended the AIWS as an institution. Do 
you believe the best future for women's athletics

19:00.580 --> 19:05.600
lies with the NCAA, or should they run their own 
programs? As

19:05.580 --> 19:16.400
long as the people who are in the head office are 
going to be fair and equal, I think it's best in the

19:05.580 --> 19:16.400
world. Because it's silly. One rule, for example, 
was I trained as a freshman from the University of

19:19.560 --> 19:27.010
Nevada to A&M. And I could compete and not get a 
scholarship. Right. If they... They went ahead

19:35.401 --> 19:36.210
and walked away. The wave didn't let me transfer 
for various reasons. But

19:38.190 --> 19:45.440
for a woman, you could transfer then under AIW. You 
could be... You could run, but you couldn't be on

19:45.420 --> 19:48.440
scholarship. For men, it was the opposite. If you 
transferred in, you were an ineligible athlete,

19:50.420 --> 19:57.200
you could be on scholarship, but you couldn't 
compete. So, it was... It's real stupid, you know.

20:00.180 --> 20:02.260
I think it needs to be under one. But I think they 
need to be fair and equal if they're going to run.

20:06.640 --> 20:13.713
I'm glad it went into the NCAA. They're doing 
something right. AIW was... And at that time, all

20:15.260 --> 20:21.310
the teams were members of it. I don't think it can 
split. There, for a year, they had AIW and NCAA. And

20:26.290 --> 20:28.310
the schools got their choice. You could go AIW or 
NCAA. So, you had a split there, and that was silly.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.720
You need one governing body, and they all need to be 
in it. Because

20:35.700 --> 20:41.740
if you don't, you're never going to be in it. That

20:41.720 --> 20:49.470
equal part's not ever going to be there. A lot of 
people didn't mind. Kay

20:50.450 --> 20:56.460
Dawn was very against it. But she was... But I think 
it was better. Why

20:58.440 --> 21:08.620
do you feel our society has not shown more interest 
in the past towards women's sports? And what do you

21:08.600 --> 21:13.300
feel the level of future interest will be? Why do 
you feel our society has not shown more interest in

21:13.280 --> 21:18.300
the past towards women's sports? And what do you 
feel the level of future interest will be like in

21:18.280 --> 21:21.300
women's basketball? Well, I think the reason why 
they haven't in the past is because they haven't

21:21.280 --> 21:28.030
had that... It's just now that... Like, for 
example, what I was saying, in 75, I graduated from

21:29.010 --> 21:33.630
high school. Well, until I was a junior, they 
didn't have any UIL. This is in Fort Worth. It's in

21:37.610 --> 21:39.140
the Metroplex area. Fort Worth and Dallas 
schools, Arlington, Indiana. UIL sports for

21:42.120 --> 21:44.830
girls. And they finally put that in because I know 
in Fort Worth my dad complained about it enough.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.840
And I said, we'll try it as a pilot program. Four 
schools out of like 10 in Fort Worth, they let them

21:53.820 --> 21:58.940
try it. And if it worked, then they... And so I think 
that's one drawback is the fact that they haven't

22:03.220 --> 22:09.080
had all those things. And even it ain't in now, you 
know, soccer. I know you can't have everything.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.850
Because that's part of the drawback. Since my 
brother went to high school, they had track,

22:30.830 --> 22:37.540
wrestling, football, basketball. They still 
don't have softball

22:37.520 --> 22:46.300
anymore. And I think that's a big problem. But I 
think it's... I think that we're getting over that

22:49.280 --> 22:51.300
now. They're adding a little bit. It's just like 
the Marathon

22:53.400 --> 23:05.540
900-meter hurdles or 300-meter hurdles in high 
school. They didn't have that as new. Yet you go to

23:07.440 --> 23:10.580
college to make a choice. So we need to have the same

23:10.560 --> 23:18.970
things. So they're getting over that. Do you feel 
athletes

23:19.950 --> 23:30.940
should live apart from the remainder of the 
student body? And do you feel the integration of

23:30.920 --> 23:41.830
athletes with the regular students would hurt or 
help them in their pursuit of education?

23:41.810 --> 23:43.830
Personally, I think they should live... They're

23:43.810 --> 23:59.100
coming

23:43.810 --> 23:59.100
and going at different times. Closing and kind of 
being

23:59.080 --> 24:32.010
yelled at from the resident

23:59.080 --> 24:32.010
advisors

23:59.080 --> 24:32.010
when we got involved. I think it's good if they can 
live apart. I think it

24:33.990 --> 25:02.050
hurts if

24:33.990 --> 25:02.050
they

24:33.990 --> 25:02.050
do live

24:33.990 --> 25:02.050
together and fit in better. And that's not to knock 
them down. It's not in every athlete. But in some,

25:05.150 --> 25:07.170
it is. You

25:07.150 --> 25:32.950
know,

25:07.150 --> 25:32.950
I think that if they were forced to live with me, but 
if I had to make a choice... Looking

25:32.930 --> 25:52.020
from an athlete's perspective, what is the role of 
the college athlete? And what is your opinion of

25:52.000 --> 25:58.020
having only volunteer college athletics in place 
of scholarship athletics? They're

25:58.000 --> 26:15.420
traveling on weekends. Because of those extra 
things, I definitely think that the athletes

26:15.400 --> 26:30.000
that... I think that the walk-on thing should 
always be there. What is the role

26:33.980 --> 26:48.540
of the college athlete? I think the role of the 
college athlete... Not

26:50.440 --> 27:02.100
necessarily wearing to and from. But

27:02.080 --> 27:23.070
know that when you go into a restaurant,

27:02.080 --> 27:23.070
you've got to show them that you're... That you 
represent your school. Both on

27:24.050 --> 27:29.480
and off the field. Do you feel that the 1980 Olympic 
boycott was the correct action to take by our

27:29.460 --> 27:34.480
government? That this action was fully 
understood by both yourself and other teammates?

27:38.460 --> 27:40.480
And will the Olympic Games ever be the same? It 
wasn't understood, but I don't agree with it. You

27:50.130 --> 27:55.410
know, what's happened now... We got a little 
miffed because I didn't come down early. I don't

27:58.960 --> 28:01.980
think the Olympics will ever, ever be the same. 
Because every year there's going to be one. And

28:06.570 --> 28:08.590
years ago, that didn't happen. I guess

28:08.570 --> 28:15.800
really since 1968, things have closed. Because of 
terrorism, also. You're always in fear. Even if

28:21.260 --> 28:23.280
you're going as an athlete. If I had gone to Moscow,

28:23.260 --> 28:34.200
I think I'd have... One reason why

28:34.180 --> 28:40.700
I completely... I had originally planned to get 
back into it the next year. Because

28:43.680 --> 28:52.420
I really got involved. I

28:52.400 --> 28:58.920
really... Take and reach that level.

29:03.180 --> 29:04.201
I think it's... I think it was terrible. At the time 
I made the team, I was real excited about making the

29:05.180 --> 29:11.040
team. And, you know, we got our watches and our 
rings. And everybody from your hometown. It sunk

29:17.890 --> 29:20.910
in probably a little bit later in the year. When I 
saw

29:20.890 --> 29:27.340
the Olympics. And then, also, they backtracked. 
And the grading bar goes with it. But

29:34.640 --> 29:43.180
you can't even remember all the athletes. I met an 
athlete on the whole Olympic team. Not just the

29:47.520 --> 29:50.590
track, but on the rowing team, the wrestling team. 
That agreed with me. I

29:51.570 --> 30:12.140
cannot

29:51.570 --> 30:12.140
remember that I do agree with them. And for some of 
those... The ones that were really

30:13.120 --> 30:24.730
bitter at that time were... Because, you know, 
being... For me, it was all new. And I was all

30:26.710 --> 30:28.730
excited. They knew what they were missing. It hit 
me a little bit.
