WEBVTT

00:06.865 --> 00:23.628
All right, the

00:06.865 --> 00:23.628
first

00:06.865 --> 00:23.628
question is, how did you get interested in 
athletics? Oh, pretty much, well, my brother got

00:23.648 --> 00:26.012
me started in athletics. When I was in the third 
grade, there was a man who came to my elementary

00:26.032 --> 00:30.578
school who was trying to start a track team, and 
he... My brother stayed after

00:30.895 --> 00:41.104
school. He was two years older than I was. He stayed 
after school and worked out with the team,

00:44.487 --> 00:51.734
and he picked the people he wanted on the team. He 
said, I've got a sister who likes to run. We always

00:52.654 --> 00:55.357
liked, we had elementary school relays and relay 
races in school time, and I always enjoyed running

00:52.654 --> 00:55.357
for some reason. I just was made for it, I guess. And 
he told the coach about me, and she said, well, have

00:56.037 --> 00:58.860
her stay after school tomorrow and practice. So 
that's really

00:58.840 --> 01:18.304
how I got started

00:58.840 --> 01:18.304
was my brother pretty much told the coach that I 
wanted to run. And so I stayed afterwards and made

01:18.324 --> 01:19.986
his team and ran into the summer track program. Did 
you run with the boys or did you run against girls?

01:21.128 --> 01:23.350
At that point, I think we pretty much just all ran 
together because we were pretty young. He just

01:23.370 --> 01:24.612
kind of wound us up and we raced and he looked at us. 
picked

01:24.592 --> 01:40.282
who he

01:24.592 --> 01:40.282
thought was the best. This particular coach, Carl 
Robbins in Fort Worth, he had never run track in his

01:40.302 --> 01:42.406
life. He was just a man who wanted to start a track 
team. I don't know why. I never had to ask him why. He

01:45.271 --> 01:45.893
was interested in that area. But he... He was the 
kind of coach that didn't push you to win just as

01:46.073 --> 01:59.175
long as you tried and you got a reward. And he would 
have relay track meets where if you just ran,

01:59.195 --> 02:02.882
everybody got rid and everybody got home. And so I 
had a good experience young because I wasn't

02:02.902 --> 02:08.531
pushed. And as a matter of fact, my parents didn't 
even come to see me run. the whole first year that I

02:11.977 --> 02:16.925
ran track. So I think it was kind of good because it 
wasn't a do or die like it is now for hockey. Did you

02:24.178 --> 02:27.363
ever compete in any other sports besides track and 
field? No. In high school, I'm not really that old,

02:28.805 --> 02:36.919
but we really didn't have anything other than 
track. That's why I was a junior. I competed in AAU

02:38.420 --> 02:55.064
and the Junior

02:38.420 --> 02:55.064
Olympics, field-led, in the summertime, summer 
programs. But the only athletic programs that we

02:55.084 --> 02:58.949
had when I was in high school was tennis and 
swimming, and then I put track in. Later they put

02:58.969 --> 03:00.151
volleyball and basketball. I was only in high 
school. So I really just picked track and stuck

03:00.712 --> 03:02.875
with that and didn't do anything else. I may have 
been different in things. I have played

03:06.563 --> 03:14.721
half-court basketball and I've played 
volleyball, but it was intramurals in high

03:06.563 --> 03:14.721
school. Should women choose sports which they 
prefer, or should they choose sports, choose

03:16.372 --> 03:25.948
those sports which are more popular, such as 
gymnastics and figure skating? I guess that would

03:27.110 --> 03:29.013
apply to nowadays. Um, they should, I think they 
should pick the sport that's best suited for them,

03:29.033 --> 03:37.006
and that they like, if they're going to want to go 
anywhere in that sport. As a matter of fact, I get

03:37.026 --> 03:38.869
phone calls and obviously

03:38.849 --> 04:03.152
the girl has a lot of talent and I would say always go 
with the thing that you like best if you plan to try

04:03.588 --> 04:08.253
to, you know, there's different levels of 
competition. If you're trying to go to the top

04:08.273 --> 04:13.178
level to do the best you can do, you've got to do 
something that you're going to like. And whether

04:13.198 --> 04:16.822
it's popular or not, it doesn't really matter. 
That's true. About the other professional sports

04:17.103 --> 04:32.840
for women, or tennis and golf, concerning the 
professional level, why do you feel women have

04:17.103 --> 04:32.840
made less money in individual sports, and why have 
women's professional teams struggled and

04:17.103 --> 04:32.840
oftentimes failed?

04:32.860 --> 04:32.920
Um, I don't really know why women don't get paid as 
much as men because I think people enjoy watching

04:34.199 --> 04:48.293
women play more than they like watching men play in 
different sports. As far as track, they seem to be,

04:49.235 --> 04:56.063
in the indoor meet, when the women, they don't have 
very many moving races. They don't have

04:56.203 --> 04:59.827
full-scale entrapments. A lot of times in the 
indoor meets, they'll have full-scale men's

04:59.847 --> 05:04.493
events. When you get to the women's events, they 
only have four or five events. It's getting

05:06.635 --> 05:11.361
better, but when I was running, it was not evenly 
distributed. And I don't know why, because the

05:11.341 --> 05:23.680
people enjoy it when the women run. I don't know, I 
can't really answer that, because I don't know

05:23.700 --> 05:29.429
why, I just don't understand. You know, I'm not 
really a women's liber. I guess it's gonna come

05:30.370 --> 05:31.111
some day. Maybe it's just the fact that the women 
need to demand it. And they'd probably pay it if

05:32.533 --> 05:35.037
they demanded it, like the men do. why have women's 
professionals

05:37.750 --> 05:59.050
teams

05:37.750 --> 05:59.050
struggle and oftentimes fail basketball and 
stuff like that the professional professional

05:37.750 --> 05:59.050
level i'm already offering no a lot of towns don't 
really they don't book those teams to come in and

05:37.750 --> 05:59.050
that's all the part of the reason

06:07.450 --> 06:14.598
As a star female athlete, you probably 
experienced many things which non-athletic

06:07.450 --> 06:14.598
girls did not experience. Did you ever feel you 
were treated differently from your peers in terms

06:14.618 --> 06:24.389
of dating, social activities, and interactions 
with non-athletic females?

06:24.409 --> 06:24.749
Yeah, definitely. It was real hard for me in high 
school. Before I hit high school, it wasn't that

06:32.418 --> 06:35.922
big a deal because I ran for my father. and the girls 
on the team were all friends. You get to high school

06:41.558 --> 06:47.845
when you've got competition between girls, and 
even girls from other schools. If you're good,

06:47.865 --> 06:50.688
you're hated, and I'm number one. It's always that 
way. If you're pretty, you're hated. If you're

06:53.511 --> 06:56.654
popular, you're hated. And that's the way it was 
for me. I was popular within my school, Because I

07:03.408 --> 07:18.413
was a varsity cheerleader and on homecoming court 
and stuff like that, so I got some things that lets

07:03.408 --> 07:18.413
me know that I was popular, but I was disliked by a 
lot of girls because I did what I wanted to do. I

07:21.143 --> 07:28.154
think it will always be. Do you think that was the 
sole reason

07:28.174 --> 07:40.293
you may be disliked because you were an athlete or 
because of the era? The girls who disliked me, they

07:40.313 --> 07:43.357
disliked me because I got a lot of publicity and 
started the Fort Worth Star Telegram. I think

07:43.377 --> 07:47.003
because I won a lot of things within the school and I 
think it was just jealousy. At the time I didn't

07:47.023 --> 07:48.265
understand that because I mean, there were a lot of 
girls that I didn't like simply because they

07:49.612 --> 07:54.079
boasted. And I didn't like that. I never had. But I 
was very, very shy. I never said very much to

07:57.985 --> 08:02.071
anybody. And kept to myself pretty much. So that 
really wouldn't have been around without it. I

08:08.444 --> 08:17.917
would say

08:08.444 --> 08:17.917
that was definitely one. And I think women. I think 
a man will respect another

08:19.098 --> 08:27.790
man for his talents. In that level, in the youth. 
When you get to college, it's a little bit

08:29.071 --> 08:30.133
different. But women, for some reason, are 
jealous about women who see fame and fortune and do

08:30.153 --> 08:34.739
good things. That's interesting. What value did 
athletics teach you? And what do you feel people

08:35.960 --> 08:37.202
should gain from athletics? It

08:38.448 --> 08:54.715
teaches

08:38.448 --> 08:54.715
you discipline,

08:38.448 --> 08:54.715
probably more than anything. Because many times 
that I didn't want to go work out, you know, it was 6,

08:54.735 --> 08:58.320
7 o'clock at night, and at that time we didn't even 
have a team going to school, and I didn't want to go.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.165
I wanted to go to the basketball game, and I wanted 
to play football, and I had to do it because it was

08:58.340 --> 09:01.165
something that I wanted. I

09:02.377 --> 09:25.778
think that's the biggest plus in

09:02.377 --> 09:25.778
any sport, athletics,

09:02.377 --> 09:25.778
is discipline yourself. You know, if you want 
something, you've got to work to get it. It's not

09:27.339 --> 09:27.999
going to get into you. No matter how good you are, 
you still have to work. As a female athlete at Texas

09:29.241 --> 09:32.063
A&M, did you feel female athletes were considered 
by their male counterparts as serious athletes?

09:32.498 --> 09:36.264
There's some reason I do at A&M now. It may be 
different in other schools. And I had a girl here

09:39.188 --> 09:48.323
from the Italian movement who were discussing 
this, and she asked me if I ever was called a jock.

09:48.343 --> 09:50.166
And I said, no, not really. Until I got out of 
college, I was never called a jock. I was called a

09:51.287 --> 09:51.688
jock. And the A&M, it seems like,

09:52.850 --> 10:07.217
it's a unique school anyway, but it seems like they 
respect you for your talents. And they don't cut

10:07.237 --> 10:08.258
you down, they support you 110%. It just goes that 
way for me. That's good. You were a very successful

10:10.433 --> 10:13.677
athlete at Texas A&M. Despite all of your 
accomplishments, I found very little

10:13.777 --> 10:19.683
information on you in both the local newspaper and 
the battalion. Do you feel you received your just

10:19.704 --> 10:25.750
recognition as an athlete, and do you think that 
you would have received more if you were a male?

10:28.894 --> 10:34.180
Oh...

10:34.200 --> 10:35.081
I don't know, to be real honest. I probably got more 
publicity than any other women at the time that I

10:39.425 --> 10:48.181
was playing in. Probably more than any woman that 
had ever attended A&M as far as athletics. And they

10:51.427 --> 10:53.952
put a big picture in the paper when I made the team. I 
was in there quite often. I don't think I was, I felt

10:57.110 --> 11:19.315
like at the time I received a lot of justice, but if 
you compared me to a male of a similar quality, the

10:57.110 --> 11:19.315
male would have gotten more publicity than I did. 
Curtis D. Coliseum, and he was always on this

11:19.335 --> 11:25.041
paper, every newspaper, every afternoon, 
whereas I might get an article in there once every

11:19.335 --> 11:25.041
two weeks or something, just right after the track 
meeting. But Jerry

11:25.021 --> 11:45.784
Wagner at the Eagle was very,

11:25.021 --> 11:45.784
very

11:25.021 --> 11:45.784
good to me when I was here. And like I said, I never 
was disappointed in the publicity that I got, but

11:45.804 --> 11:48.988
it wasn't on an equal level with the Union of 
Binomials. And it never has been, not even when I

11:49.008 --> 11:50.169
was in high school. And I got a lot of publicity from 
high school, probably more than any other female

11:50.189 --> 11:52.431
athlete at that time. Probably since, if I'm not 
worried. After I made the Olympic team, which was

11:54.569 --> 12:10.534
the ultimate

11:54.569 --> 12:10.534
goal for me, and it's probably the ultimate goal 
for any amateur athlete. I didn't get near the

12:10.554 --> 12:13.679
publicity and had all that, but I thought I should 
have. And as a matter of fact, my family, they were

12:13.699 --> 12:14.901
the best. And we went to Washington, and they 
honored all the athletes in Washington. I talked

12:17.064 --> 12:17.926
to a lot of kids from small towns. Sport work is not 
small. And they were saying that

12:19.308 --> 12:38.939
they had like a day for them, like when you walk in 
the day, they would give them the kids with the

12:19.308 --> 12:38.939
city, you know, they would give them luggage with 
their initials on it. And really, this one guy was a

12:38.959 --> 12:40.682
wrestler that I was talking to that got all this 
stuff. And there were some other athletes that

12:40.702 --> 12:43.987
were really highly recognized from the high 
school and brought home and took a take away down

12:40.702 --> 12:43.987
the main street. Small towns, but still. Whereas I

12:46.274 --> 12:59.331
didn't really get anything.

12:59.351 --> 13:00.513
I think A&M was pretty proud of me. And I got a little 
bit of publicity, but that was it. Probably less

13:02.576 --> 13:05.720
publicity after I made the team than what I got 
after the track meet after I did 11 track meetings,

13:02.576 --> 13:05.720
which I think is really sad. When you were talking 
about Curtis Dickey, were you talking about him as

13:05.740 --> 13:08.203
a track athlete or as a football player? You got a 
lot more as a track athlete? No, well... Well, once

13:12.143 --> 13:14.468
track season started, he did. Now, it was a 
never-ending thing for him because he was really

13:14.488 --> 13:21.061
good. And he went from football to track, and he got 
a lot of

13:21.081 --> 13:26.471
publicity in the track season. Okay, the Title IX 
section of the Equal Rights Amendment of 72

13:26.491 --> 13:33.004
guarantees women equality with men in all areas of 
athletics. Did you at any time feel the women's

13:33.760 --> 13:45.572
athletic program at Texas A&M was treated equally 
with the men's athletic program in terms of

13:33.760 --> 13:45.572
housing, scholarships, equipment, or benefits 
or anything like that? As far as housing, no. I was

13:47.474 --> 13:56.924
on full scholarship, and they put me in a Spence 
Hall, which is one of the four homes, and that was

13:47.474 --> 13:56.924
the women's athletic room at the time. And the boys 
were over at King Hall, and my husband played

13:56.944 --> 14:01.489
football for A&M for a while.

14:04.760 --> 14:09.173
there quite a bit, and I would say definitely not. I 
think it's better than it was at any other

14:10.276 --> 14:15.190
Southwest Conference school. We have marvelous 
facilities, but when I was dating him, we didn't

14:15.391 --> 14:19.984
have the locker room they do now. I think A&M is 
trying to have the best women's program of any of

14:20.251 --> 14:35.133
the schools, and I think they probably do in the 
conference. I think Texas is pretty good, but I

14:35.153 --> 14:38.158
don't know if the facilities are any better. I 
really

14:39.455 --> 15:03.015
couldn't have

14:39.455 --> 15:03.015
any complaints from when I was in Indiana because 
we flew to nationals every year and we had nice

14:39.455 --> 15:03.015
uniforms, we traveled on the band, which I think, I 
would probably complain that maybe we couldn't

14:39.455 --> 15:03.015
get big Graham buses off of Enstein, but you know, 
If we're comparing the women's track team to the

15:04.244 --> 15:21.284
men's track

15:04.244 --> 15:21.284
team, I would say we're pretty much on an equal 
basis. If you compare us to the football team,

15:21.304 --> 15:23.066
we're not. A lot of women will complain that no one 
gets exactly what all the men's teams get. But even

15:25.970 --> 15:27.532
the men's team don't get equal proportions. So how 
can you expect that when you're on the women's

15:27.552 --> 15:28.733
team? I'm pretty level-headed in that. I've 
always had proper shoes

15:31.594 --> 15:43.980
and uniforms and expense money and all that. So I 
really don't have any complaints in that area. I

15:45.123 --> 15:47.127
think definitely there's a little bit of a 
difference there, but it's not.

15:51.832 --> 15:57.483
As a result of the Title IX, there was a tremendous 
increase in the budget of women's athletics at

15:51.832 --> 15:57.483
A&M. During your years here, the budget increased 
from $104,000 to $420,000. Was the increase in the

16:03.375 --> 16:10.870
budget evident to you during your years

16:03.375 --> 16:10.870
here? running for A&M, which was my sophomore 
year. And I was the only one on a full scholarship.

16:18.536 --> 16:20.421
And there were a few partials. And even the coach 
didn't make very much money. And then the next

16:22.887 --> 16:26.496
year, my junior year, it was like we had five

16:26.678 --> 16:36.307
full scholarship women at least. As a matter of 
fact, we had more women on scholarship on the

16:36.327 --> 16:43.433
women's team than what the men had on their team. 
And, of course, then it was separate coaches. So I

16:46.196 --> 16:49.759
thought that was really interesting that we had 
more money than they did. And it was real hard for

16:49.779 --> 16:53.442
the men to accept some of the men that were on their 
team that were walk-ons or that were only getting

16:49.779 --> 16:53.442
books and tuition. And they compared themselves 
to this other girl over here who was on the men's

16:53.462 --> 16:56.145
scholarship and full scholarship. And I said, I 
can't do it. So you could definitely tell, and the

16:56.665 --> 17:03.202
coach got a bigger increase. Awesome. So you could 
definitely tell that we had more money when they

17:03.402 --> 17:08.295
came in. From its inception, most colleges and the 
NCAA have been against Title IX. They argued that

17:15.055 --> 17:22.168
an equal funding of men's and women's athletics 
would be an economic disaster for college

17:15.055 --> 17:22.168
athletics. Do you feel this is a viable reason to 
disallow women an equal opportunity with men to

17:22.188 --> 17:27.077
enjoy athletics?

17:30.922 --> 17:49.924
Well, I

17:30.922 --> 17:49.924
know

17:30.922 --> 17:49.924
that some of

17:30.922 --> 17:49.924
the schools have really bucked it. You know, they 
don't want, they don't want them doing women's

17:49.944 --> 17:55.731
programs either. I don't think that's the case at 
A&M. I know some of the schools are that way and

17:56.532 --> 17:58.775
they've even totally cut out some of the women's 
programs. I think that they need to accept it and

17:58.795 --> 18:00.777
that's the way it's going to be and do the best they 
can. I can't

18:00.757 --> 18:17.120
believe

18:00.757 --> 18:17.120
that they're having that problem now. It's been, 
well I graduated in 1979, and it was kind of tough

18:17.140 --> 18:22.668
when I was like a junior, senior, but it's been long 
enough now that I can't imagine them accepting it.

18:22.688 --> 18:27.034
University of Houston, for example, they had one 
coach, well we do too at A&M now, and the men and

18:22.688 --> 18:27.034
women's teams are under one coach, Tom 
Nicolettes, and they have been for a long time, and

18:22.688 --> 18:27.034
that's super team. And I don't think that he is 
going to say, well, I'm going to let the women's

18:27.014 --> 18:46.955
program separate from the men's

18:27.014 --> 18:46.955
program. Women groups have fought for the 
separation of women's athletics from men's. They

18:50.639 --> 18:55.924
feel the only way for women's athletics to prosper 
is for women to run their own programs. 1982 the

18:56.461 --> 19:00.967
NCAA into the AIAW as an institution. Do you 
believe the best future for women athletics lies

19:00.987 --> 19:08.796
with the NCAA or should they run their own 
programs? Well, as long as the people who are in the

19:08.816 --> 19:18.408
head office are going to be fair and equal, I think 
it's best to move on. Because it's silly One rule,

19:21.892 --> 19:35.452
for example, was I transferred as a freshman from 
University of Nevada to A&M, and I could compete

19:21.892 --> 19:35.452
and not get a scholarship, okay? If they went ahead 
and waived it and let me transfer for various

19:35.472 --> 19:45.687
reasons, I had to go before the Ethics and 
Intelligence Building Committee. But for a

19:45.707 --> 19:47.410
woman, you could transfer then under AIW. You 
could run, but you couldn't be on scholarship. For

19:48.772 --> 19:50.835
men, it was the opposite. If you transferred in, 
you were an ineligible athlete, you could be on

19:50.815 --> 20:02.433
scholarship, but you couldn't compete. So it's 
real stupid. I think it needs to be under one, but I

20:02.914 --> 20:06.600
think they need to be fair and equal if they're 
going to do that. I'm glad it went to NCAA. I like

20:09.585 --> 20:10.867
their rules. They've been around for a long time. 
They're doing something right. AIAW was good. It

20:18.619 --> 20:19.341
was okay. And at that time, all the teams were 
members of it. I don't think it can split. There for

20:23.248 --> 20:26.234
a year, they had AIAW and NCAA. And schools got 
their choice. You could go AIAW or NCAA. So you had a

20:31.163 --> 20:33.186
split there. And that was silly. You need one 
governing body. They all need to be in one. And I

20:37.955 --> 20:38.997
think many women should be in the same. Because

20:38.977 --> 20:55.525
if

20:38.977 --> 20:55.525
you don't, you're never going to be that equal 
part. It's not ever going to be there because

20:55.545 --> 20:57.328
you've got to remember two different people. So I 
thought that was a good move. A lot of people didn't

20:58.250 --> 20:58.991
like that. The women's athletic director was Kay 
Don. Kay Don was very against it. Yeah, but she was,

21:00.454 --> 21:01.896
but I think it was better in the end for us and then. 
Why do you feel our society is not showing more

21:04.070 --> 21:13.922
interest in the past towards women's sports, and 
what do you feel the level of future interest will

21:04.070 --> 21:13.922
be? What do you feel our society is not showing more 
interest in the past towards women's sports, and

21:13.942 --> 21:21.912
what do you feel the level of future interest will 
be like? Well, I think the reason why they haven't

21:21.932 --> 21:27.659
in the past is because they haven't had that many 
things for women. You know, it's just now that,

21:27.679 --> 21:33.486
like, for example, what I was saying, in 75, I 
graduated from high school Well, until I was a

21:33.466 --> 21:43.377
junior, they didn't have any UIL. This is in Fort 
Worth, the Metroplex area. Fort Worth and Dallas

21:46.501 --> 21:50.825
schools, Arlington, they didn't even have UIL 
sports for girls. And they finally put that in

21:50.845 --> 21:54.089
because I know in Fort Worth, my dad complained 
about it enough. And they kind of said, we'll try it

21:54.109 --> 22:00.056
as a pilot program, which meant four schools out of 
like 10 in Fort Worth, they let them try it. And if it

22:00.076 --> 22:02.779
worked, then they would put it in all schools in my 
senior year. Yeah. And so I think that's one

22:02.879 --> 22:09.868
drawback is the fact that they haven't had all 
those things available. And even at A&M now, you

22:09.948 --> 22:14.514
know, soccer needs to be NCAA. It's a club right now 
under some other ruling, I'm not sure what it is.

22:18.760 --> 22:22.985
And it needs to, it should be, we should have a 
gymnastics program. We don't. I know you can't

22:23.786 --> 22:31.857
have everything because you probably don't have 
the funding for it, but that's part of the drawback

22:23.786 --> 22:31.857
where men's sense... When my brother went to high 
school, they had track, wrestling, football,

22:32.225 --> 22:45.030
basketball, baseball, and they don't have any of 
those. They still don't have softball in a lot of

22:45.050 --> 22:46.112
schools. And that's an NCAA program in college. So 
I think that's a big problem. But I think we're

22:49.980 --> 22:50.942
getting over that now. They're adding a little bit 
at a time. It's just like the marathon not being an

23:01.494 --> 23:08.423
event for such a long time. 400 meter hurdles or 300 
meter hurdles in high school for girls. They

23:11.787 --> 23:14.069
didn't have that as an event for a long time. Yet you 
go to college to make a trip and they have that. So we

23:15.231 --> 23:16.853
need to have the same things in the high schools 
that you have in colleges. It just doesn't...

23:17.213 --> 23:21.602
They're getting over that right now. It's 
definitely a plus.

23:27.595 --> 23:30.581
Do you feel athletes should live apart from the 
remainder of the student body? And do you feel the

23:31.383 --> 23:38.057
integration of athletes with the regular 
students would hurt or help them in their pursuit

23:31.383 --> 23:38.057
of education?

23:41.902 --> 23:54.223
Personally,

23:41.902 --> 23:54.223
I think they should live apart because athletes, 
they're coming and going at different times.

23:54.777 --> 24:06.001
Maybe,

23:54.777 --> 24:06.001
for instance, the cafeteria closing. I remember 
the swimmers had to go to the snack bar across the

24:06.021 --> 24:12.955
way over at Mosher in those halls because the 
cafeteria was closed when they got through the

24:06.021 --> 24:12.955
workouts. You're getting up early hours. We were 
constantly being yelled at from the... I think

24:15.601 --> 24:43.600
it's good if they can live apart because of those 
type things, but I don't think it hurts if they do

24:15.601 --> 24:43.600
live together. Women athletes seem

24:45.655 --> 24:58.509
to fit in better with regular students. I would say 
much more than any other place. In particular, I

24:59.512 --> 25:00.474
would say the football players. The basketball 
players who walk a little taller than everybody

25:00.494 --> 25:01.858
else. And that's not to knock them down,

25:01.838 --> 25:18.338
but it's not in every

25:01.838 --> 25:18.338
athlete,

25:01.838 --> 25:18.338
but in some it is. It's just like, for example, when 
they threw the pizza guy down the stairs, they

25:18.358 --> 25:21.001
didn't hear him or that, and they had to come over. 
You know, they think they can roughhouse

25:21.021 --> 25:22.323
everything. The football players. It was the 
football players. They took the pizza and threw

25:23.364 --> 25:24.726
the guy down the stairs and came home. You know, I 
think... that if they were forced to live with the

25:25.463 --> 25:37.673
regular students, that it would be

25:25.463 --> 25:37.673
good in that instance. But if I had to make a choice, 
I'd rather have them live separate. Their food

25:39.939 --> 25:41.683
requirements are a little bit different also.

25:48.245 --> 26:01.644
Speaking from an athlete's perspective, what is 
the role of the college athlete and what is your

25:48.245 --> 26:01.644
opinion of having only volunteer college 
athletics in place of scholarship athletics? I

26:01.664 --> 26:04.047
don't think volunteer will be good. I think if 
somebody's got a talent.

26:08.967 --> 26:21.193
should

26:08.967 --> 26:21.193
be rewarded for the extra hours that they put in. 
You know, you're out there, you're traveling on

26:21.213 --> 26:27.766
weekends, it makes it harder to study for an exam, 
you're missing a major exam on a Friday, you're

26:21.213 --> 26:27.766
traveling all weekend in a van, you're missing a 
lot of Texas in a van. Because of those extra

26:27.786 --> 26:29.490
things, I definitely think that you should be 
rewarded for it. The athletes that, I think that

26:29.605 --> 26:35.337
the walk-on thing, it should always be there. I 
don't think you should have to be on

26:35.518 --> 26:45.540
the college to be on the team. Because if they can 
walk on out there and be on the team, that's good

26:45.560 --> 26:47.043
too. What is the role of the college athlete? I 
think the role of the college athlete is to

26:49.838 --> 26:57.399
represent the school to the best of their ability. 
Not necessarily wearing dresses to and from,

26:57.419 --> 27:04.860
which a lot of coaches used to do that. But know that 
when

27:04.840 --> 27:20.470
you go into a restaurant,

27:04.840 --> 27:20.470
you've got your sweats on, so it sticks them in. But 
those people know you're an athlete, they can see

27:20.490 --> 27:25.740
you, and that you're responsible to show them that 
you're a good person, or you don't carry their

27:20.490 --> 27:25.740
restaurant down, or you know obscenities, and 
that sort of thing. But to represent your school

27:25.760 --> 27:27.203
well, both on and off the field. Do you feel the 1980 
Olympic boycott was the correct action to take by

27:29.613 --> 27:41.529
our government, that this action was fully 
understood by both yourself and other teammates,

27:29.613 --> 27:41.529
and will the Olympic Games ever be the same? It 
wasn't understood by the teammates at all, myself

27:41.549 --> 27:47.818
or any of the other teams. They were very bitter 
about it. I don't agree with it. I think it was a

27:50.922 --> 27:53.005
mistake. You know, what's happened now, we got a 
little miffed because I didn't come to our

27:53.710 --> 27:59.439
Olympics. I don't think the Olympics will ever, 
ever be the same because every year there's going

27:59.459 --> 28:06.530
to be one country that's going to work off of what 
was going to happen. And years ago, that didn't

28:06.550 --> 28:08.273
happen. I guess really since 68, things have 
really started changing in the Olympic realm. You

28:13.601 --> 28:16.426
had terrorist attacks and stuff like that. 
Because of terrorism, also, it wouldn't be the

28:16.446 --> 28:19.130
same. You're always in fear of that. Even if you're 
going, as an athlete, if I had gone to Moscow, I

28:21.470 --> 28:42.539
think I'd

28:21.470 --> 28:42.539
have been a little bit nervous. But I think we're 
going to have to try to keep politics out as much as

28:42.559 --> 28:44.482
possible. And that's real hard. One reason why I 
completely quit competing was because I was sick

28:44.942 --> 28:47.366
and tired of all politics after 1980. I had 
originally planned to get back into it the next

28:47.386 --> 28:49.128
year and start competing again. And I tried 
working out. I just couldn't get over it. It

28:50.230 --> 28:50.430
just... Because I really got involved, and

28:50.798 --> 29:00.669
I really understood just how nasty it really was. 
And until you reach that level, you don't really

29:00.689 --> 29:04.473
know what it's like. But I think it was terrible. At 
the time I made the team, I was real excited about

29:06.255 --> 29:11.620
making the team. And we got our watches and our 
rings, and everybody from the hometown is

29:11.640 --> 29:15.945
excited. But

29:16.786 --> 29:38.198
then it

29:16.786 --> 29:38.198
sunk in probably a little bit later in the year when 
I saw the Olympics

29:16.786 --> 29:38.198
on television when I really missed it and how 
stupid it was. And then also they backtracked a few

29:38.218 --> 29:39.960
years later, and the grain embargo is lifted. No 
big deal. But you can't ever give the memories back

29:40.241 --> 29:41.362
to them again. So I think it was a big mistake, and I 
don't think they'll ever be the same. And all the

29:43.205 --> 29:43.806
athletes were I

29:44.377 --> 30:07.190
don't think I met an athlete on

29:44.377 --> 30:07.190
the whole Olympic team, not just the track team, 
but on the rowing team and wrestling that agreed

29:44.377 --> 30:07.190
with it. I don't, I cannot remember one that said 
that I do agree with it. And a lot of them wouldn't

30:09.052 --> 30:11.656
even shake President Carter's hand when he went to 
the White House and he took him to the country. They

30:11.676 --> 30:12.477
wouldn't even shake his hand. It was really a bad, 
bad scene. And for some of those, um, The ones that

30:14.245 --> 30:28.107
were

30:14.245 --> 30:28.107
really bitter at that time were the ones that had 
made a team before. It was their second Olympic

30:28.127 --> 30:31.993
team or third. For me, it was all new and I was all 
excited. They knew what they were missing and they

30:33.075 --> 30:34.597
were real bad bitter. It hit me a little bit later 
on.

30:51.539 --> 31:05.498
You're

30:51.539 --> 31:05.498
so cute like that.
