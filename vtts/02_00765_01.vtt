00:06.815 --> 00:24.102
My first question

00:06.815 --> 00:24.102
is, how

00:06.815 --> 00:24.102
did you get interested in athletics? Oh, pretty 
much, well, my brother got me started in

00:24.122 --> 00:26.426
athletics. When I was in the third grade, there was 
a man who came to my elementary school who was

00:26.446 --> 00:30.612
trying to start a track team, and he... My

00:30.592 --> 00:41.087
brother stayed after school. He was two years 
older than I was. He stayed after school and worked

00:44.192 --> 00:49.179
out with the team and he picked the people he wanted 
on the team. He said, I've got a sister who likes to

00:49.199 --> 00:50.441
run. We always like, we had elementary school 
relays and relay races in school time and I always

00:50.461 --> 00:54.627
enjoyed running for some reason. I just was made 
for it, I guess. And he told the coach about me and

00:56.109 --> 00:58.793
she said, we'll have her stay after school 
tomorrow and we'll practice. So that's

00:58.773 --> 01:18.140
really

00:58.773 --> 01:18.140
how I got started, was my brother pretty much told 
the coach that I wanted to run. And so I stayed

01:18.160 --> 01:20.023
afterwards and made his team and ran into him in the 
summer track program. Did you run with the boys or

01:20.043 --> 01:21.144
did you run against girls? At that point, I think we 
pretty much just all ran together because we were

01:21.164 --> 01:23.167
pretty young. He just kind of lined us up and we 
raced and he looked at us. picked

01:24.777 --> 01:40.523
who he

01:24.777 --> 01:40.523
thought was the best. This particular coach, Carl 
Robbins in Fort Worth, he had never run track in his

01:40.543 --> 01:43.027
life. He was just a man who wanted to start a track 
team. I don't know why, I never had to ask him why he

01:44.089 --> 01:45.992
was interested in that area, but he He was the kind 
of coach that didn't push you to win just as long as

01:45.972 --> 01:58.244
you tried and you got a reward. He would have relay 
track meets where if you just ran, everybody got a

01:58.264 --> 02:00.690
win and everybody got a reward. And so I had a good 
experience young

02:01.244 --> 02:17.367
because I wasn't pushed. And as a matter of fact, my 
parents didn't even come to see me run the whole

02:17.387 --> 02:24.677
first year that I ran track. So I think it was kind of 
good because it wasn't a do or die like it is now. Did

02:27.782 --> 02:29.304
you ever compete in any other sports besides track 
and field? No. In high school, we... I'm not really

02:31.602 --> 02:35.826
that old, but we really didn't have anything. 
That's why I was a junior. I

02:38.369 --> 02:57.307
competed in AAU

02:38.369 --> 02:57.307
and the Junior Olympics,

02:38.369 --> 02:57.307
Keto Lab, in the summertime, summer programs. But 
the only athletic programs that we had when I was in

02:57.327 --> 03:00.110
high school was tennis and swimming, and I put 
track in. Later they put volleyball and

03:00.130 --> 03:02.732
basketball after I was all done with school. So I 
really just picked track and stuck with that and

03:02.752 --> 03:04.414
didn't do anything else. But I may have been 
different in that I had other things going on. I

03:05.875 --> 03:13.202
have played half-court basketball, and I've 
played volleyball, but it was intramurals in high

03:05.875 --> 03:13.202
school.

03:16.388 --> 03:30.683
Should women choose sports which they prefer, or 
should they choose sports, choose those sports

03:16.388 --> 03:30.683
which are more popular, such as gymnastics and 
figure skating?

03:30.703 --> 03:33.466
I guess that would apply to now, I guess. Um, they 
should, I think they should pick the sport that's

03:33.486 --> 03:40.774
best suited for them, and that they like, if 
they're going to want to go anywhere in that sport.

03:40.794 --> 03:42.936
As a matter of fact, I get phone calls from parents 
all the time, wanting a chicken around his table.

03:43.253 --> 04:04.705
who's

03:43.253 --> 04:04.705
daughter likes

03:43.253 --> 04:04.705
track but she's also good in basketball and she's 
good in volleyball and coaches are pushing her to

03:43.253 --> 04:04.705
do all three but she doesn't want to and obviously 
the girl has a lot of talent and I would say always go

03:43.253 --> 04:04.705
with the thing that you like best if you plan to try 
to There's different levels of competition. If

04:08.200 --> 04:11.865
you're trying to go to the top level to do what you 
should do, you've got to do something that you're

04:08.200 --> 04:11.865
going to like. And whether it's popular or not, it 
doesn't really matter. That's true. About the

04:17.031 --> 04:20.716
other professional sports for women are tennis 
and golf. Concerning the professional level, why

04:20.736 --> 04:29.106
do you feel women have made less money in 
individual sports, and why have women's

04:20.736 --> 04:29.106
professional teams struggled and oftentimes 
failed?

04:34.182 --> 04:48.327
I don't really know why women don't get paid as much 
as men because I think people enjoy watching women

04:34.182 --> 04:48.327
play more than they like watching men play in 
different sports. As far as track, they seem to be

04:49.201 --> 04:58.485
in the indoor meet when the women, they don't have 
very many women races. They don't have a full scale

04:58.505 --> 05:02.816
in track meets. A lot of times in the indoor meets 
they'll have a full scale men's events. When you

05:04.500 --> 05:06.265
get to the women's events, they only have four or 
five events. It's getting better, but when I was

05:06.481 --> 05:20.419
running it wasn't,

05:06.481 --> 05:20.419
it was not evenly distributed. And I don't know 
why, because the people enjoy it when women run. I

05:26.808 --> 05:29.091
don't know, I can't really answer that because I 
don't run. I just don't understand. You know, I'm

05:29.672 --> 05:30.573
not really a women's libero. I guess it's gonna 
come some day. Maybe it's just the fact that the

05:31.554 --> 05:33.056
women need to demand it. I mean, they'd probably 
pay it if they demanded it, like the men do. Why

05:37.784 --> 05:57.427
do women's professional teams struggle and often 
times fail at basketball and stuff like that? At

05:57.447 --> 05:58.147
the professional level? No, a lot of towns don't 
really, they don't book those teams to come in. And

05:59.669 --> 06:00.450
that's probably part of the reason.

06:07.417 --> 06:14.584
As a star female athlete, you probably 
experienced many things which non-athletic

06:07.417 --> 06:14.584
girls did not experience. Did you ever feel you 
were treated differently from your peers in terms

06:14.604 --> 06:24.574
of dating, social activities, and interactions 
with non-athletic females?

06:24.594 --> 06:27.056
Yeah, definitely. It was real hard for me in high 
school. Before I hit high school, it wasn't that

06:29.759 --> 06:35.905
big a deal because I ran for my father. And the girls 
on the team were all friends. You get to high school

06:41.347 --> 06:47.617
where you've got competition between girls and 
even girls from other schools. If you're good,

06:47.837 --> 06:50.702
you're hated. It's always that way. If you're 
pretty, you're hated. If you're popular, you're

06:53.285 --> 06:56.631
hated. And that's the way it was for me. I was 
popular within my school. because I was a varsity

07:03.374 --> 07:19.780
cheerleader and on homecoming court and stuff 
like that so I got some things that let's me know

07:03.374 --> 07:19.780
that I was popular but I was disliked by a lot of 
girls because I did what I wanted to do I think it

07:21.110 --> 07:28.197
will always be. You think that was the sole reason

07:28.217 --> 07:41.911
you may be disliked because you were an athlete or 
because of the girls who disliked me. They

07:41.931 --> 07:43.753
disliked me because I got a lot of publicity and 
started Fort Worth Star Telegram. I think because

07:43.773 --> 07:46.716
I won a lot of things within the school and I think it 
was just jealousy. But at the time I didn't

07:46.736 --> 07:48.298
understand that because I mean, there were a lot of 
girls that I didn't like simply because they

07:49.561 --> 07:54.469
boasted. And I didn't like that. I never had. But I 
was very, very shy. I never said very much to

07:57.954 --> 08:02.021
anybody. And kept to myself pretty much. So that 
really wouldn't have been a reason for that. I

08:08.377 --> 08:19.293
would say that was definitely

08:08.377 --> 08:19.293
one, and I think women. I think a man will respect 
another man for his talents

08:19.313 --> 08:31.391
in that level, but in the youth. When you get to 
college, it's a little bit different. But women,

08:32.492 --> 08:34.755
for some reason, are jealous about women who see 
fame and fortune and do good things. That's

08:34.775 --> 08:35.156
interesting. What value did athletics teach you, 
and what do you feel people should gain from

08:35.176 --> 08:37.219
athletics? It

08:38.380 --> 08:54.442
teaches you discipline. Probably more than 
anything. Because many times that I didn't want to

08:55.043 --> 08:56.905
go work out, you know, it was 6, 7 o'clock at night. 
And at that time we didn't even have a team going to

08:56.925 --> 08:58.127
school. And I didn't want to go. I wanted to go to the 
basketball game. I wanted to play football. And I

08:59.969 --> 09:01.131
had to do it because it was something that I wanted. 
I think

09:02.292 --> 09:23.903
that's

09:02.292 --> 09:23.903
the biggest plus in any

09:02.292 --> 09:23.903
sport or athletics is discipline, learn to 
discipline yourself. You know, if you want

09:23.923 --> 09:25.165
something, you've got to work to get it. It's not 
going to get you to it. No matter how good you are,

09:25.886 --> 09:27.749
you still have to work or else you're going to lose 
it. And I think that's a good thing. As a female

09:28.951 --> 09:31.995
athlete at Texas A&M, did you feel female athletes 
were considered by their male counterparts as

09:28.951 --> 09:31.995
serious athletes? For some reason I do at A&M now. 
It may be different in other schools. And I had a

09:41.103 --> 09:47.296
girl here from the Italian group who were 
discussing this. And she asked me if I ever was

09:47.316 --> 09:49.039
called a jock. And I said, no, not really. Until I 
got out of college, I was never called a jock. I was

09:51.123 --> 09:51.925
called a jock. And

09:52.715 --> 10:07.177
at A&M,

09:52.715 --> 10:07.177
it seems like it's a unique school anyway, but it 
seems like they respect you for the talents. And

10:07.197 --> 10:07.758
they don't cut you down. They support you 110%. It 
just goes that way for me. That's good. You were a

10:10.383 --> 10:13.647
very successful athlete at Texas A&M. Despite all 
of your accomplishments, I found very little

10:13.747 --> 10:18.733
information on you in both the local newspaper and 
the battalion. Do you feel you received your just

10:19.774 --> 10:29.125
recognition as an athlete, and do you think that 
you would have received more if you were a male?

10:36.714 --> 10:36.815
Oh... I don't know, to be real honest. I probably 
got more publicity than

10:39.290 --> 10:48.552
any other women at the time that I was playing in. 
Probably more than any woman that had ever

10:48.572 --> 10:51.318
attended A&M as far as I played. And they put a big 
picture in the paper when I made the team. I was in

10:53.864 --> 10:54.987
there quite often and I don't think I was, I felt 
like at the time I received a lot of justice, but if

10:57.093 --> 11:11.924
you compared me to a male of a similar quality, a 
male would have gotten more publicity than I did.

11:11.944 --> 11:13.988
Curtis did to a skill level, and he was always on his 
way. every newspaper,

11:13.968 --> 11:21.759
every afternoon. Whereas I might get an article in 
there once every two weeks or something, or just

11:21.779 --> 11:29.550
right after the tragedy. But Jerry Wagner and the 
eagle was very, very good to me when I was here. And

11:31.133 --> 11:31.453
like I said, I never was disappointed

11:32.480 --> 11:47.630
in the publicity that I got, but it wasn't on an 
equal level with women by no means. And it never has

11:47.651 --> 11:49.454
been, not even when I was in high school. And I got a 
lot of publicity when I was in high school,

11:49.474 --> 11:52.500
probably more than any other female athlete at 
that time. Probably since, if I'm not wrong. After

11:53.262 --> 11:53.863
I made the Olympic team, which was the ultimate 
goal for me, and it's probably the ultimate goal

11:54.518 --> 12:09.780
for any amateur athlete. I didn't get near the 
publicity and had on the fact that I thought I

12:09.800 --> 12:13.786
should have. And as a matter of fact, my family, 
they were basically, and we went to Washington,

12:13.806 --> 12:19.294
and they honored all the athletes in Washington, 
and I talked to a lot of kids who were from small

12:13.806 --> 12:19.294
towns, and Fort Worth is not small. And they were 
saying that they

12:19.274 --> 12:34.531
had like a day for them, like when you walk in the 
day. They were giving the kids with the city, you

12:34.551 --> 12:41.079
know, they were giving luggage with their 
initials on it. And really, this one guy was a

12:41.099 --> 12:43.241
wrestler that I was talking to that got all this 
stuff. And there were some other athletes that

12:43.261 --> 12:46.605
were really highly recognized from high school 
and brought home and took a tape for it. And that's

12:46.625 --> 12:47.146
great. Small towns, but still. Whereas I didn't 
really get anything. I think A&M was pretty proud

12:49.649 --> 12:56.799
of me. I got a little bit of publicity, but that was 
it. Probably less publicity after I made the team

12:59.823 --> 13:05.530
than what I got after the track meet after I did well 
in the track meet, which I think is really sad. When

13:05.550 --> 13:08.014
you were talking about Curtis Dickey, were you 
talking about him as a track athlete or as a

13:05.550 --> 13:08.014
football player? Did you get a lot more as a track 
athlete? No, well... Well, once track season

13:12.042 --> 13:19.253
started, he did, and it was a never-ending thing 
for him because it was really good. And he went from

13:19.273 --> 13:27.246
football to track, and he got a lot of

13:19.273 --> 13:27.246
publicity in the track season. Okay, the Title IX 
section of the Equal Rights Amendment of 72

13:27.266 --> 13:33.055
guarantees women equality with men in all areas of 
athletics. Did you at any time feel the women's

13:33.710 --> 13:45.566
athletic program at Texas A&M was treated equally 
with the men's athletic program in terms of

13:33.710 --> 13:45.566
housing, scholarships, equipment, or benefits, 
or anything like that? As far as housing, no. I was

13:47.348 --> 13:56.200
on full scholarship, and they put me in Spence 
Hall, which is one of the four homes, and that was

13:47.348 --> 13:56.200
the women's athletic room. And boys were over at 
King Hall, and my husband played football for A&M

13:56.921 --> 14:01.067
for

14:04.777 --> 14:09.083
I would say definitely not. I think it's better 
than it was at any other Southwest Conference

14:10.225 --> 14:19.218
school. We have marvelous facilities, but when I 
was at A&M, we didn't have the locker room they do

14:19.358 --> 14:26.669
now. I think A&M is trying to have the best women's 
program of any of the schools, and I think they

14:27.070 --> 14:30.875
probably do in the conference. I think Texas is 
pretty good.

14:35.202 --> 15:00.121
I

14:35.202 --> 15:00.121
really

14:35.202 --> 15:00.121
couldn't have any

14:35.202 --> 15:00.121
complaints because we flew to nationals every 
year and we had nice uniforms. We traveled on the

15:00.141 --> 15:03.066
band, which I think I would probably complain that 
maybe we couldn't get big Graham buses like the

15:00.141 --> 15:03.066
men's team did. If we're comparing the women's 
track team to the men's track team,

15:04.160 --> 15:19.700
I would say we're pretty much on an equal basis. If 
you compare us to the football team, we're not, but

15:19.720 --> 15:22.783
then we don't make as much money as they do either. A 
lot of women will complain that no one gets exactly

15:22.803 --> 15:28.851
what all the men's teams get, but even the men's 
team don't get equal proportions, so how can you

15:22.803 --> 15:28.851
expect that when you're on the women's team? I'm 
pretty level-headed in that. I've always had

15:31.249 --> 15:41.611
proper shoes and uniforms and expense money and 
all that. So I really don't have any complaints in

15:41.631 --> 15:43.515
that area. I think definitely there's a little bit 
of a difference there, but it's not...

15:51.798 --> 15:57.471
As a result of the Title IX, there was a tremendous 
increase in the budget of women's athletics at

15:51.798 --> 15:57.471
A&M. During your years here, the budget increased 
from $104,000 to $420,000. Was the increase in the

16:03.345 --> 16:06.071
budget evident to you during your years here? 
We... The first year I was running for A&M, which

16:09.382 --> 16:19.522
was my sophomore year, and I was the only one on a 
full scholarship. And there were a few partials.

16:20.444 --> 16:22.829
And even the coach didn't make very much money. And 
then the next year, my junior year, it was like we

16:22.849 --> 16:26.496
had... five full scholarship women athletes. As a 
matter of fact, we had more women on scholarship on

16:32.742 --> 16:40.168
the women's team than what the men had on their 
team. And, of course, then it was separate

16:40.188 --> 16:42.010
coaches. So I thought that was really interesting 
that we had more money than they did. And it was real

16:46.254 --> 16:51.278
hard for the men to accept some of the men that were 
on their team that would walk on or that were only

16:46.254 --> 16:51.278
getting books and tuition. And they'd compare 
themselves to this other girl over here who was the

16:51.298 --> 16:56.483
one that had scholarship or full scholarship and 
said, I can't do it. So you could definitely tell,

16:56.463 --> 17:04.876
and the coach got a bigger increase also. So you 
could definitely tell that we had more money when

17:04.896 --> 17:10.986
they came

17:04.896 --> 17:10.986
in. From its inception, most colleges and the NCAA 
had been against Title IX. They argued that an

17:15.052 --> 17:21.542
equal funding of men's and women's athletics 
would be an economic disaster for college

17:15.052 --> 17:21.542
athletics. Do you feel this is a viable reason to 
disallow women an

17:22.045 --> 17:35.510
equal opportunity with men to enjoy athletics? 
Well, I know that some of the schools have really

17:35.530 --> 17:39.176
bucked it. You know, they don't want, they don't 
want the men in these programs equal. I don't think

17:41.440 --> 17:42.282
that's the case at A&M.

17:45.687 --> 17:58.183
I know some of

17:45.687 --> 17:58.183
the schools are that way and they've even totally 
cut out some of their women's programs. I think

17:58.203 --> 18:00.490
that they need to accept it and that's the way it's 
going to be and do the best they can. I can't believe

18:00.942 --> 18:13.246
that they're

18:00.942 --> 18:13.246
having that problem now. It's been, when I 
graduated in 79, and it was kind of tough when I was

18:13.266 --> 18:20.460
like a junior, senior, but it's been long enough 
now that I can't imagine them accepting it.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.683
University of Houston, for example, they have one 
coach. Well, we do too at A&M now, and the men and

18:21.703 --> 18:23.406
women's teams are under one coach coming. I

18:23.386 --> 18:33.565
don't think that he is going to say, well, I'm going 
to let the women's program say what they want to.

18:46.201 --> 18:50.326
Women groups have fought for the separation of 
women's athletics from men's. They feel the only

18:50.606 --> 18:56.694
way for women's athletics to prosper is for women 
to run their own programs. In 1982, the NCAA ended

18:56.714 --> 19:01.059
the AIAW as an institution. To be the best future 
for women athletics lies with the NCAA or should

19:01.500 --> 19:06.606
they run their own programs? Well, as long as the 
people who are in the head office are going to be

19:08.493 --> 19:18.589
fair and equal, I think it's best to move on. 
Because it's silly.

19:22.155 --> 19:33.353
One rule, for example, is I transferred as a 
freshman from the University of Nevada to A&M, and

19:22.155 --> 19:33.353
I could compete and not get scholarships. If they 
went ahead and waived it and let me transfer for

19:34.818 --> 19:41.125
various reasons, I had to go before the Ethics and 
Eligibility Committee. But for a woman, you could

19:41.145 --> 19:45.250
transfer then under AIW. You could run, but you 
couldn't be on scholarship. The men, it was the

19:49.174 --> 19:50.976
opposite. If you transferred in, you were an 
ineligible athlete, you could be on scholarship,

19:50.996 --> 19:57.163
but you couldn't compete. So it's real stupid. I 
think it needs to be under one, but I think they need

20:00.349 --> 20:06.580
to be fair and equal if they're going to do that. I'm 
glad it went NCAA. I like their rules. They've been

20:10.788 --> 20:13.914
around for a long time. They're doing something 
right. AIAW was good. It was okay. And at that time,

20:19.461 --> 20:21.824
all the teams were members of it. I don't think it 
can split. There for a year, they had AIAW and NCAA.

20:26.689 --> 20:32.255
And schools got their choice. You could go AIAW or 
NCAA. So you had a split there. And

20:35.458 --> 20:38.922
that was silly. You need one governing body. They 
all need to be in one. And I think men and women

20:41.404 --> 20:42.846
should be in the same. Because if you don't, you're 
never going to be that equal part. It's not ever

20:44.207 --> 20:45.108
going to be there. Because you've got to be two 
different... So

20:47.245 --> 21:02.571
I thought that was

20:47.245 --> 21:02.571
a good move. A lot of people didn't like that. I 
mean, women's athletic director was Kay Dawn. Kay

21:04.234 --> 21:05.436
Dawn was very against it. Yeah, but she was, but I 
think it was better in the end for us. Why do you feel

21:06.919 --> 21:09.443
our society is not so more interested in the path 
towards women's sports? And what do you feel the

21:09.463 --> 21:10.705
level of future interest will be? What do you feel 
our society has not shown more interest in the past

21:11.326 --> 21:21.426
towards women's sports, and what do you feel the 
level of future interest will be like in women's

21:11.326 --> 21:21.426
basketball? Well, I think the reason why they 
haven't in the past is because they haven't had

21:21.446 --> 21:27.337
that many things for women. You know, it's just now 
that, like for example, what I was saying, in 75, I

21:27.357 --> 21:33.469
graduated from high school, Well,

21:33.449 --> 21:42.777
until I was a junior, they didn't have any UIL. This 
is in Fort Worth, the Metroplex area. Fort Worth

21:46.340 --> 21:50.844
and Dallas schools, Arlington, they didn't even 
have UIL sports for girls. And they finally put

21:50.864 --> 22:02.815
that in because I know in Fort Worth, my dad 
complained about it enough, and they finally

21:50.864 --> 22:02.815
said, we'll try it as a pilot program, which meant 
four schools out of like 10 in Fort Worth, they let

21:50.864 --> 22:02.815
them try it, and if it worked, then they would put it 
in all schools in my senior year. And so I think

22:02.795 --> 22:10.402
that's one drawback is the fact that they haven't 
had all those things available. And even at A&M

22:10.562 --> 22:13.986
now, you know, soccer needs to be NCAA. It's a club 
right now. I know some other ruling, I'm not sure

22:15.887 --> 22:18.590
what it is. And it needs to, it should be, we should 
have a gymnastics program. We don't. I know you

22:23.855 --> 22:30.321
can't have everything because you probably don't 
have the funding for it, but that's part of the

22:23.855 --> 22:30.321
drawback where men's, Since when my brother went 
to high school, they had track, wrestling,

22:30.790 --> 22:44.576
football, basketball, baseball, and they don't 
have any of those. They still don't have softball

22:44.596 --> 22:46.619
in a lot of schools. And that's an NCAA program in 
college. So I think that's a big problem. But I

22:49.184 --> 22:50.807
think we're getting over that now. They're adding 
a little bit

22:51.057 --> 23:03.596
at a time.

23:03.616 --> 23:09.025
It's just like the marathon not being an event for 
such a long time. 400-meter hurdles or 300-meter

23:09.045 --> 23:11.749
hurdles in high school for girls. They didn't have 
that as an event for a long time, yet you go to

23:11.769 --> 23:14.994
college the next year and they have it. So we need to 
have the same things in the high schools that we

23:15.014 --> 23:16.616
have in colleges. It just doesn't... measure. So 
they're getting over that right now. It's

23:21.858 --> 23:25.542
definitely a plus. Do you feel athletes should 
live apart from the remainder of the student body?

23:31.749 --> 23:44.804
And do you feel the integration of athletes with 
the regular students would hurt or help them in

23:31.749 --> 23:44.804
their

23:31.749 --> 23:44.804
pursuit of education? Personally, I think they 
should live apart because athletes They're

23:48.466 --> 24:05.611
coming and going at different times. Maybe, for 
instance, the cafeteria closing. I remember the

24:06.512 --> 24:08.134
swimmers had to go to the snack bar across the way 
over at Mosher. And that was always because the

24:08.154 --> 24:09.917
cafeteria was closed when they got through the 
workouts. Uh-huh.

24:14.364 --> 24:24.338
Uh,

24:14.364 --> 24:24.338
you're getting out at earlier hours. We were 
constantly being yelled at from the Corps of

24:24.358 --> 24:27.182
Women, Head of Women, whatever they were called, 
in the Resident Advisors. When we got into the

24:27.202 --> 24:28.645
workout, they were saying, it's time to be quiet. 
It's bedtime. Well, shoot, we were just getting

24:28.945 --> 24:29.967
into the workout. And hadn't had any leisure time. 
It might have been 5.30 or 6. So, I think... I think

24:32.138 --> 24:50.920
it's good if they can live apart because of those 
type things, but I don't think it hurts if they do

24:32.138 --> 24:50.920
live together. Women athletes seem to fit in 
better with regular students. I would say much

24:53.143 --> 24:53.944
more than men athletes. the

24:55.207 --> 25:13.966
basketball

24:55.207 --> 25:13.966
players

24:55.207 --> 25:13.966
who walk a little taller than everybody else. And 
that's not to knock them down, but it's not in every

25:13.986 --> 25:17.870
athlete, but in some it is. It's just like, for 
example, when they threw the pizza guy down the

25:17.890 --> 25:20.893
stairs, they gave him a year and a half of the 
cookie. You know, they think they can breath house

25:20.913 --> 25:21.994
everything. The football players. It was the 
football players. They took the pizza and threw it

25:23.295 --> 25:24.557
down the stairs and came home. You know, I think... 
That if they

25:25.463 --> 25:38.390
were

25:25.463 --> 25:38.390
forced to live with the regular students, that it 
would be good in that instance. But if I had to make a

25:38.410 --> 25:39.934
choice, I'd rather have them live separately. 
Their food requirements are a little bit

25:39.954 --> 25:41.076
different also.

25:48.228 --> 26:07.975
Speaking from an athlete's perspective,

25:48.228 --> 26:07.975
what is the role of the college athlete

25:48.228 --> 26:07.975
and what is your opinion of having only volunteer 
college athletics in place of scholarship

25:48.228 --> 26:07.975
athletics? I don't think volunteer will be good. I 
think if somebody's got a talent that they should

26:08.756 --> 26:11.620
be rewarded for the extra hours that they put in. 
You know, you're out there, you're traveling on

26:12.190 --> 26:28.225
weekends, it makes it harder to study for an exam, 
you're missing a major exam on a Friday, you're

26:12.190 --> 26:28.225
traveling all weekend in a van, you don't want to 
come clubbing in Texas in a van. Because of those

26:28.245 --> 26:30.027
extra things, I definitely think that you should 
be rewarded for it. The athletes that, I think that

26:30.047 --> 26:35.151
the walk-on thing, it should always be there. I 
don't think you should have to be on scholarship to

26:35.171 --> 26:41.337
be on the team, because if they can walk on out there 
and be on the team, that's good too.

26:46.767 --> 26:48.913
What is the role of the college athlete? I think

26:49.771 --> 27:09.459
the role of a college athlete is to represent the 
school to the best of their ability. Not

27:09.479 --> 27:12.744
necessarily wearing dresses to and from, which a 
lot of the coaches used to do that. But know that

27:12.764 --> 27:14.867
when you go into a restaurant, you've got your 
sweats on, so let's take some in. But those people

27:14.887 --> 27:17.871
know you're an athlete and that you're 
responsible to show them that you're a good

27:17.851 --> 27:31.057
person, where they don't carry their breath spot 
down, no obscenities and that

27:17.851 --> 27:31.057
sort of thing, but to represent yourself well, 
both on and off the field. Do you feel the 1980

27:31.077 --> 27:34.964
Olympic boycott was the correct action to take by 
our government? That this action was fully

27:34.984 --> 27:40.635
understood by both yourself and other teammates, 
and will the Olympic Games ever be the same? It

27:41.088 --> 27:49.988
wasn't

27:41.088 --> 27:49.988
understood by the teammates at all, myself or any 
of the other teams. They were very bitter about it.

27:51.912 --> 27:52.353
I don't agree with it. I think it was a mistake. you 
know, what's happened now. We got a little miffed

27:56.092 --> 27:59.156
because I didn't come to our Olympics. I don't 
think the Olympics will ever, ever be the same

27:59.176 --> 28:06.526
because every year there's going to be one country 
that's going to boycott the one that's going to

27:59.176 --> 28:06.526
happen. And years ago, that didn't happen. I 
guess, really, since 68, things have really

28:08.268 --> 28:14.136
started changing in the Olympic realm. You had 
terrorist attacks and stuff like that. Because of

28:16.399 --> 28:19.783
terrorism, also, it won't be the same. You're 
always in fear of that. even if you're going as an

28:21.065 --> 28:29.997
athlete.

28:30.017 --> 28:40.911
If I had gone to Moscow, I think

28:30.017 --> 28:40.911
I'd have been a little bit nervous. But I think 
we're going to have to try to keep the politics out

28:40.931 --> 28:44.495
as much as possible. And that's real hard. One 
reason why I completely quit competing was

28:44.956 --> 28:47.099
because I was sick and tired of all politics after 
1980. I had originally planned to get back into it

28:47.119 --> 28:49.001
the next year and start competing again. And I 
tried working out. I just couldn't get on with it.

28:50.163 --> 28:50.363
It just... Because I really got involved, and I 
really understood just how nasty that event

28:50.782 --> 29:01.173
really was. And until you reach that level, you 
don't really know what it's like. But, you know, I

29:05.057 --> 29:06.979
think it was terrible. At the time I made the team, I 
was real excited about making the team. And, you

29:11.403 --> 29:15.287
know, we got our watches and our rings, and 
everybody from the hometown said, that,

29:16.735 --> 29:38.584
but

29:16.735 --> 29:38.584
then it sunk in probably a little bit later in the

29:16.735 --> 29:38.584
year when I saw the Olympics on television and how 
stupid it was. And then also they backtracked a few

29:38.604 --> 29:40.246
years later, and the grain embargoes lifted. No 
big deal. But you can't ever give the memories

29:40.527 --> 29:41.368
back. So I think it was a big mistake, and I don't 
think the Olympics saved all the athletes I

29:44.360 --> 30:02.954
don't think I met

29:44.360 --> 30:02.954
an athlete on the whole Olympic team, not just the 
track team, but on the rowing team, the wrestling

29:44.360 --> 30:02.954
team, that agreed with it. I cannot remember one 
that said no. I just don't remember. Yeah, I do

30:04.236 --> 30:04.737
agree with it. And a lot of them wouldn't even shake 
President Carter's hand when he went to the White

30:04.757 --> 30:07.262
House and he took him to the country. They

30:07.816 --> 30:19.647
wouldn't even shake his hand.

30:19.667 --> 30:24.432
It was

30:19.667 --> 30:24.432
really a bad, bad scene. And for some of those, the 
ones that were really bitter at that time that I

30:24.452 --> 30:31.378
remember were the ones that had made a team before. 
It was their second Olympic team or third. Because

30:32.259 --> 30:33.380
for me, it was all new, and I was all excited. They 
knew what they were missing, and they were real bad

30:33.400 --> 30:34.681
bitter. It hit me a little bit later on.

30:57.412 --> 31:05.346
Like

30:57.412 --> 31:05.346
that.
