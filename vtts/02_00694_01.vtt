WEBVTT

00:03.490 --> 00:24.836
All right, today is December the 1st, and I'm 
interviewing Dr. Barbara Stone, associate

00:03.490 --> 00:24.836
professor of interdisciplinary education, who 
was appointed to Texas A&M, or came to Texas A&M in

00:03.490 --> 00:24.836
1977, and has worked in the IDED department. And 
we're going to talk a little bit about some of the

00:25.898 --> 00:32.586
changes that you have perceived, Dr. Stone, since 
you arrived at A&M. things that have occurred that

00:33.460 --> 00:44.236
you feel had great impact on the College of 
Education and how you have seen the changes and

00:33.460 --> 00:44.236
what has happened since you have been here? Could 
you just think back to the major things that have

00:45.178 --> 00:49.845
changed since you've arrived? Well, of course, 
the change in the dean was dramatic change.

01:03.447 --> 01:19.061
changing in some of the departments, the decline 
of IVTE, or industrial ed,

01:03.447 --> 01:19.061
the switching of ed tech from industrial ed to 
IDED. There are a number of things of that nature.

01:25.366 --> 01:26.827
Can you give me a little background? What brought 
about these changes? You know, an idea? Yep. Do you

01:36.280 --> 01:38.122
want to talk about it? Sure. Why not? OK.

01:43.670 --> 01:48.037
I can't remember exactly how long ago it was, but it 
might have been 81 or 82. Cargan

01:49.018 --> 01:56.269
suggested that he did more than suggest. He caused 
a planning committee to be formed to a

01:56.289 --> 02:03.019
representative from Ag Ed, Industrial Ed, voc ed 
and adult ed, the gang of four, to look into the

02:03.252 --> 02:15.623
possibility of combining IDED and IED into one 
department. At

02:17.265 --> 02:31.217
the onset of that, it was my understanding that the 
dean said that neither of the existing chairmen

02:17.265 --> 02:31.217
would be the chair of the new department. At that 
point, also, voc ed was a part of IDED. That may or

02:42.327 --> 02:45.231
may not have come out in some other interview. As a 
matter of fact, IDED was started initially

02:46.213 --> 02:56.228
because there was federal money for voc ed 
fellows, doctoral fellows. I think there were 16

02:56.369 --> 02:57.611
of them. And they needed somewhere to put them. and 
their whatever it was, so they made IDED, which is

03:00.323 --> 03:05.010
not a department. It is an administrative bucket. 
At that point, Adult Ed was in Ed-Ed, and I do not

03:08.856 --> 03:21.915
know how Adult Ed got from Ed-Ed to IDED, but it 
happened before 77 before I came. I didn't even

03:21.935 --> 03:24.900
know that. In any case, We struggled, the gang of 
four struggled for some year with numerous

03:27.644 --> 03:38.039
meetings and going back and reporting to our 
constituencies and so forth. And each time the

03:39.100 --> 03:52.519
adult ed faculty declined to join industrial ed or 
to join a total group because we felt that adult ed

03:39.100 --> 03:52.519
was far more than just industrial training for 
adults. And we got away with not going along. There

04:03.918 --> 04:09.104
have been some consequences, in my personal 
opinion, that went along with our refusal to play.

04:10.246 --> 04:19.397
But the upshot of that, I think, although I'm 
oversimplifying it, I'm sure, is that the Voc Ed

04:10.246 --> 04:19.397
program has been virtually destroyed.

04:22.380 --> 04:28.347
And that's too bad, because it was a viable program 
and it serves a need. I think now they're making an

04:29.086 --> 04:36.714
effort to bring it back again now that the 
leadership of IDT has changed. But there are a

04:39.197 --> 04:47.386
number of things of that nature that we've 
experienced. I don't know if this makes any sense

04:47.406 --> 04:49.789
out of context. Well, it's a first. No, that's 
fine. In other words, the fact that they could not

04:52.332 --> 04:57.237
be joined with IDED or voc ed, is that what really 
had the most impact on it, sort of dissimulating?

05:05.912 --> 05:06.112
On voc ed? No. Well, you would need to verify this 
with a voc ed perception if you didn't care to. But

05:12.922 --> 05:22.836
from my, I honestly believe it was an in-house 
fight that some of the faculty in industrial ed

05:12.922 --> 05:22.836
felt that they knew all about voc ed. And the voc ed 
people are joint split appointments. And so there

05:27.895 --> 05:31.740
was a power fight, and they lost. Now, that's 
oversimplified and what have you, but it's what I

05:31.760 --> 05:36.187
think happened. The political influence. And you 
asked what I thought. That's what it is. OK, here we

05:39.852 --> 05:42.616
go. So that kind of covers what you feel has caused 
the major changes. What about just within IDED? Is

05:49.666 --> 05:55.714
there something, some other changes that have 
occurred since you arrived in 77 in the last two

05:49.666 --> 05:55.714
years? Oh, yeah, when I first came, IDED, because 
it's a non-department, anybody can teach a course

05:58.152 --> 06:05.044
in IDED. And the credits for the teacher go back to 
the teacher's department so that we don't own

06:05.204 --> 06:12.917
IDED. Oh, I see. It's an administrative device, 
but McNamara can teach something and did for a

06:14.980 --> 06:20.650
while. Don Clark can teach something and IDED 
doesn't get those credits in terms of budget and

06:21.203 --> 06:27.492
what have you. They go back to Clark's own 
department or Grace Chisholm or what have you. But

06:33.982 --> 06:45.259
originally when I came there were I guess as many as 
15 faculty members who considered themselves

06:33.982 --> 06:45.259
IDED faculty members. Ag Ed people, Voc Ed people 
were in there. industrial ed people and stuff. And

06:51.736 --> 07:02.226
so when we had a meeting of IDED to talk about 
curriculum or admissions requirements or

06:51.736 --> 07:02.226
something, the whole world was telling adult ed 
what we had to do. And we had endless meetings that

07:02.386 --> 07:11.375
had to be sat through to be believed.

07:12.877 --> 07:14.539
That got peeled away. And I have now, well, voc ed's 
was taken and put into, or they agreed to go into

07:19.321 --> 07:23.206
industrial ed. We kind of knocked away the ag ed a 
little bit, but still a couple of the ag ed, one of

07:24.268 --> 07:37.746
the ag ed faculty members will chair an adult ed 
committee from time to time, Jim Christiansen.

07:38.607 --> 07:43.033
And we consider him really an adult ed person. Has 
Don Seaman been the IDED director, I mean, chair

07:43.351 --> 07:49.940
the whole time since it's been in existence? No. 
Don Clark was its initial den mother. Okay. When he

07:56.388 --> 08:01.755
was associate dean of the College of Education for 
research. Oh, he held both? He was both. And, in

08:06.121 --> 08:12.750
fact, it was Don Clark who hired me in May of 77, or 
April or whatever it was. By the time I got here in

08:12.832 --> 08:19.001
August, I went to Don Clark and I said, hi. And he 
said, I'm not your boss. And I said, wonderful, who

08:21.144 --> 08:22.806
is? And so he sent me to some chap who was then 
coordinator of the vocab program, who had become

08:22.886 --> 08:32.880
chair, not chair, coordinator of IDE. I can't even 
remember his name. He left. And I went and I said,

08:35.964 --> 08:37.246
hello. And he said, I'm not your boss. Oh. So then I 
ended up with Don Seaman, you know, saying, look,

08:41.333 --> 08:48.166
somebody's going to call us coordinator. Because 
it's not a department. So that, he kind of evolved

08:51.893 --> 08:55.700
into that position. Well, he got a, well, no, 
there's a story that goes with that, too. When this

09:02.252 --> 09:05.097
Vulcan person left, whatever his name was, There 
was still voc-ed faculty and adult-ed faculty,

09:07.557 --> 09:14.847
plus these appendage faculty members. And we got 
called into a meeting in the little conference

09:16.008 --> 09:21.996
room on the seventh floor with Dean Hubert. And 
Dean Hubert spent a half an hour telling us why he

09:23.198 --> 09:32.170
had selected Don Seaman as the coordinator of that 
meeting.

09:35.014 --> 09:36.636
See, I hadn't gotten all of that story yet. And, 
well, I had only interviewed one in this

09:37.409 --> 09:43.136
department, so I needed all that background to tie 
it all together. Because that department is hard.

09:44.658 --> 09:50.105
And everybody, in fact, Dean Corrigan said that to 
me the other day, you know, by talking to Huber,

09:44.658 --> 09:50.105
about how did this all happen? How did you get this 
department, you know, started? Or, you know, how

09:52.708 --> 09:53.929
did it come about? And he said it was because of the 
need for that right, a grant, and didn't know it.

09:58.935 --> 10:00.177
And also, well... I'll tell you some more pieces 
not on tape. Okay. All right. Now, do you feel that

10:04.683 --> 10:15.518
the college is achieving its mission of teaching, 
research, and service, the mission of the land

10:04.683 --> 10:15.518
grant colleges? And I guess to what extent, I mean, 
do you feel? Because there's been some changes

10:18.482 --> 10:26.653
with emphasis, you know, some departments 
emphasizing one more than the other or feeling

10:18.482 --> 10:26.653
that they're doing more. research or teaching or 
service or whatever. Well, it's my understanding

10:29.512 --> 10:45.611
that Caravan feels, and furthermore, it's my 
understanding that the administration of the

10:29.512 --> 10:45.611
university feel that faculty members can 
negotiate to emphasize the right to emphasize any

10:29.512 --> 10:45.611
one of the three in any given year. They've made 
that, I think, very clear in the Tenure and

10:46.613 --> 10:55.223
Promotion Advisory Committee of the college.

10:57.953 --> 11:00.556
How do you balance yourself?

11:02.579 --> 11:03.079
Me? I heavily emphasize teaching. Second is 
research. Second is service. And third is

11:09.527 --> 11:10.468
research.

11:13.172 --> 11:17.156
In your department, is that the norm, pretty much? 
Or does it vary within the department of people

11:17.177 --> 11:20.380
also? It varies with individuals. But because we 
teach off campus, and we have such a heavy load of

11:21.542 --> 11:25.767
graduate students, None of us are very heavily 
into research, because we choose to work with the

11:26.337 --> 11:31.322
students first. And time and energy goes. And 
there are five of us and 100 doctoral students. And

11:39.650 --> 11:40.411
it's wonderful. We have the best student group in 
the world, without any question. But there isn't.

11:48.238 --> 11:54.184
Well, I suppose there would be time if one wanted to 
spend all one's time doing that. When you teach, I

11:54.890 --> 12:00.356
taught in Corpus this semester, and that's six 
weekends gone. And then you come back and you do all

12:01.317 --> 12:04.501
week two, and I'm not complaining. No. But I'm just 
saying that I choose to work with students rather

12:04.981 --> 12:10.428
than to do research at this point. But you do not get 
pressure, and you also don't get penalized if you

12:11.269 --> 12:15.133
don't. I don't think we get promoted like other 
people. I don't think we will get promoted like

12:17.996 --> 12:23.142
other people when it reaches the university 
level. I don't care what they say. You mean anybody

12:26.108 --> 12:28.672
that is not working heavy on research?

12:34.079 --> 12:37.243
Sheila, could you get that and get a number, 
please? That's just my . Let me say another thing

12:40.148 --> 12:42.130
about that. I think more than research, I believe 
that getting funded projects gets you promoted.

12:50.722 --> 12:55.609
And that takes more time yet, and also takes time 
away from the students. I don't honestly see how

12:56.163 --> 13:01.608
one can do all of those things and do them all well. 
And I know they say you can choose, but I don't

13:02.689 --> 13:10.617
believe that they mean it when it comes to 
promotion time. Has that always been the case, or

13:10.917 --> 13:16.343
is it changing gradually as far as emphasis? I 
don't know. OK. Under Dean Hubert and Dean

13:20.186 --> 13:25.832
Corrigan, have you perceived a difference in the 
emphasis? Much more emphasis now on getting

13:26.420 --> 13:35.132
funded projects for which you get no release time, 
for which you get no space to put your project

13:26.420 --> 13:35.132
people. Linda has umpteen projects working out of 
what used to be our conference room, which got

13:35.833 --> 13:43.724
taken away from us without anybody even saying 
anything to us. You've got all that story. Right.

13:49.212 --> 13:55.380
So that it's a difficult kind of thing, and I 
understand that they are working under pressure

13:49.212 --> 13:55.380
from other people as well. the dean. It's the 
higher? Sure. OK. Now, of course, you work mostly

13:59.525 --> 14:03.951
with graduate students. Isn't that correct, in 
the department? Yes. I occasionally work with one

14:07.035 --> 14:11.721
undergraduate course in volunteer 
administration. Because the tremendous growth

14:11.741 --> 14:21.434
at Texas A&M would not probably affect your work 
with students as much as it would the

14:11.741 --> 14:21.434
undergraduate faculty, or has it? Because 100 
students for five faculty For doctoral students,

14:24.824 --> 14:36.246
as you almost have seen, and on the one hand, we get 
told to reduce the number, and on the other hand, we

14:24.824 --> 14:36.246
get told to be sure the count's up. How are you going 
to do that?

14:40.775 --> 14:46.967
No, I think the College of Education probably has 
been impacted least by the growth of the

14:40.775 --> 14:46.967
university. Because we've always had more 
graduate, or for a number of years, we've had more

14:48.196 --> 14:56.725
graduates than undergraduates anyway. Or about 
50-50. Because there's Ed Ed and there's us, and we

14:59.729 --> 15:03.653
only deal with graduate students. And also Ed 
Psych? Ed Psych has some undergraduate, not a

15:07.017 --> 15:10.481
major, but some undergraduate courses. Some 
undergraduate courses. There's service

15:11.101 --> 15:15.006
courses, special ed and some other things. Right. 
Okay. What about collaboration among the

15:17.575 --> 15:25.044
departments within the college and then even with 
the college and other colleges outside? Have you

15:25.485 --> 15:27.347
perceived any changes in that?

15:30.571 --> 15:33.534
Really, I think the collaboration is good. When 
Paulette and I became editors of one of our

15:35.857 --> 15:44.988
national journals, I had to learn a number of 
things about computer applets and that sort of

15:35.857 --> 15:44.988
thing. I didn't know beans about it. And I 
ricocheted around that campus for about six

15:46.904 --> 15:52.370
months getting all the information and the 
training I needed. And everybody was uniformly

15:53.070 --> 15:58.977
marvelous and helpful and excited about the 
project. I mean, the people in the computing

15:59.377 --> 16:01.419
service center. The guy who's head of the 
philosophy department regularly uplinks

16:03.041 --> 16:09.528
computer material to Oxford University and to 
MIT. And he said, this is how we do it. Everybody was

16:12.050 --> 16:13.772
just marvelous. So on that basis, nobody gave me 
the slightest hint they didn't have time or they

16:14.107 --> 16:21.514
weren't interested. And that's almost across the 
university when I've had that kind of need. But you

16:26.478 --> 16:32.463
had a unique opportunity to do it, whereas maybe 
other faculty members do not have that same

16:26.478 --> 16:32.463
opportunity. Well, I don't know. I'm also not very 
sophisticated as an individual. And when I need to

16:36.787 --> 16:43.253
know something, I run around and say, do you know 
about this and can you help me? And it may be they

16:43.621 --> 16:49.907
were, you know, taken aback by a foolish lady doing 
all that. I don't know. But they were very helpful.

16:54.411 --> 17:09.564
When most of the contacts I've had have been in the 
Senate and the Graduate Council and in doctoral

16:54.411 --> 17:09.564
committees and working with graduate council 
reps. Have you been on the Senate? You said on the

17:09.664 --> 17:10.945
back of the Senate? Yes. And I'm now on the Graduate 
Council. What is the Graduate Council? It is a

17:16.416 --> 17:31.009
subgroup of the Senate which attends to issues 
relating to graduate study, including clearing

17:16.416 --> 17:31.009
courses to be forwarded to the system. Is that new? 
No. Was that in existence before the Senate? Oh,

17:36.902 --> 17:37.243
yes. But it was then, when they reorganized the 
administration, it was subsumed as a subgroup of

17:37.783 --> 17:45.134
the Senate. Prior to the Senate,

17:46.215 --> 18:00.034
I guess it was the third year of the Senate, the 
Senate finally won the point that the graduate

17:46.215 --> 18:00.034
dean would not automatically be the chair of the 
graduate council. And poor Leo. We made Leo so mad.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.642
Leo Berman. Is he not there anymore? No, he 
retired. He's a marvelous person. Now, is there

18:10.047 --> 18:10.788
another? Is there a head of the graduate? What they 
did, they had a Rowan Scope study. And Corrigan was

18:17.737 --> 18:21.443
on the committee, and a bunch of others. And Sam 
Black, who was the Speaker of the Senate, and some

18:21.463 --> 18:26.129
other people I kind of remember. And they 
basically looked at what the graduate college was

18:28.685 --> 18:33.191
doing and came up with a suggestion that it would be 
done away with. What they recommended was to put

18:34.694 --> 18:49.275
the function, most of the functions, of the 
graduate college in each dean's office and let

18:34.694 --> 18:49.275
each college look after itself. And that was, I 
think, to have, as I understand it, to have been the

18:49.295 --> 18:54.422
procedure. However, Each dean then asked for an 
associate dean with support staff to take on those

18:55.735 --> 19:03.343
responsibilities. And so instead of a graduate 
college, we have an office of graduate studies,

19:03.923 --> 19:17.357
which is presently under Dwayne Anderson, who is 
the associate provost for research and graduate

19:03.923 --> 19:17.357
study. So it didn't work with the deans 
individually then, doing it? No. Well, where was

19:23.803 --> 19:25.405
the money going to come from? Well, and then you'd 
have had seven. But

19:27.600 --> 19:41.436
in any case, Dwayne Anderson is a member ex 
officio, I think with vote, maybe ex officio

19:27.600 --> 19:41.436
without vote, on the Graduate Council. Why would I 
be able to get all of this to triangulate and get all

19:41.876 --> 19:49.444
of the facts and figures and the times and how the 
policy changes? Would the faculty senate have

19:49.725 --> 19:55.611
minutes or get information that will What do you 
think of that?

20:00.969 --> 20:01.971
I'm not sure that I need it. But that would be 
differently involved in your study. So it

20:06.757 --> 20:07.618
shouldn't be. I think Sam Black, who is acting dean 
of the medical college, Sam was speaker of the

20:08.199 --> 20:17.211
Senate when this began to happen. And he's a very 
friendly, articulate person. I think Linda said

20:21.336 --> 20:25.041
there are some either minutes or agendas of the 
faculty. Oh, yes, there are legal minutes. And

20:27.544 --> 20:28.966
will those be in the archives? I don't know. Okay. 
Talk to Patty

20:31.489 --> 20:35.094
Steele. I want to say Steele. I think that's right. 
Patty Steele, there is an office for the faculty

20:37.016 --> 20:47.350
senate in Goodwin, on the second floor of Goodwin. 
And Patty is a very nice person. OK, great. OK, now

20:52.738 --> 21:01.027
your department itself, IDED, how do you see that 
department collaborating within the college

20:52.738 --> 21:01.027
with any other departments? Not just like, OK, you 
have this project on the Lifelong Learning

21:03.030 --> 21:15.885
Journal, but what are some other opportunities 
that faculty members in your department have to

21:03.030 --> 21:15.885
interact or to work? or collaborate? I know on 
graduate committees you all sit on the level. We

21:20.988 --> 21:24.893
have all at one time or another participated in the 
inquiry groups. The inquiry groups seem to be

21:26.755 --> 21:31.922
somewhat dormant at the moment, as far as I can 
tell, mostly. But we've all worked hard at one time

21:33.183 --> 21:37.769
or another, not in the past year or so.

21:40.793 --> 21:44.978
And we also,

21:40.793 --> 21:44.978
well, Again, I need to know about meta-analysis. 
And Dick Wilson in EdSight teaches a course in

21:47.921 --> 21:50.606
that. So I went to him and I said, oh, other thing. 
And he gave me a quick and dirty session, which was

21:54.853 --> 21:59.080
far from sufficient. So I'm going to sit in on his 
course this fall, this spring. We do things like

22:03.708 --> 22:10.560
that a lot, because we are running to keep up and 
learning with our students. That's true. OK. Now,

22:13.748 --> 22:20.981
what about perceptions of others or outsiders 
towards the College of Education? Do you pick up

22:21.021 --> 22:26.330
too much of that, not only on a state level, but on a 
national level? And you're involved in a lot of

22:26.350 --> 22:29.916
national type. I'm involved, oddly, on the 
national level, like as a consultant to the

22:29.956 --> 22:36.868
National Forage Council. How do you feel the 
College of Education at A&M is perceived as you

22:37.692 --> 22:44.782
travel around and participate in so many other 
things? What do you feel? Nothing negative.

22:48.688 --> 22:50.650
Nobody says, oh, you're from education. People 
just sort of listen to what you say. And if it fits,

22:54.196 --> 22:56.799
they go on from there. And if it doesn't, they say, 
hmm. I've not felt any negative kind of things.

23:03.836 --> 23:05.057
What about the reputation? Does the reputation 
extend beyond the state very much of the college

23:05.498 --> 23:15.230
because of the fact that it has, you know, it 
produces the most teachers in the state? Or, you

23:15.250 --> 23:17.253
know, is that known? Are those facts known much? I 
don't know. I don't know. So, but it's sort of... We

23:21.919 --> 23:28.287
are, as a program in our national association, 
Because right now, we have probably more students

23:29.583 --> 23:35.349
making presentations at the national meetings 
than anybody else. We had eight, 10 or 12 people

23:35.369 --> 23:39.052
making presentations in Washington. IDED 
people? Adult ed people. I was a proud den mother. I

23:44.577 --> 23:46.439
was running around, busting my buttons. Eight 
presentations? I think it was more like 12 to 15.

23:52.365 --> 23:55.468
They're just superior people. They really are. 
That's wonderful. One guy came up who graduated in

23:58.372 --> 24:06.481
78, all spit and polish, with a full bird colonel, 
with a chest full of ribbons. He's now in the

24:06.501 --> 24:12.567
Surgeon General's office, head of training for 
medical personnel for the Army. So these were not

24:14.730 --> 24:16.572
people that are still at A&M. They're people that 
have gone out and now are doing? Well, no. That 12 to

24:19.555 --> 24:26.202
15 was current students, or people who just 
graduated. But if we just can get the Coast Guard

24:26.772 --> 24:37.907
and the Marines, we'll have the training of all the 
military services tied up. That's incredible.

24:38.628 --> 24:39.009
That's great. Irrelevant to your study. No, but 
everything is relevant in different ways. Now,

24:43.335 --> 24:55.952
the future and visions and what you think is going 
to happen to this college in the 21st century with

24:43.335 --> 24:55.952
all of the monumental changes and upheavals that 
are in the... Do you have any feel for what's... I

24:59.486 --> 25:00.828
know what I wish could happen. What is that? That we 
could somehow get ourselves together as a

25:03.813 --> 25:23.543
non-political group, which is not likely, and 
look at what the children need and redesign it so

25:03.813 --> 25:23.543
that the people would be ready to help the children 
learn it or help the adult learners learn it. I

25:23.877 --> 25:35.374
think we're, of course I would think this, but I 
think we're doing a more adequate job of

25:23.877 --> 25:35.374
preparation than we are with adults than we are 
with children. And that's an and all the people

25:36.235 --> 25:42.665
working with adults are doing a better job than 
getting. What do you attribute that to?

25:47.192 --> 25:50.937
Locked in ways of thinking.

25:51.679 --> 25:52.279
On the other side? On the other side of it. Is it the 
pedagogy versus... That's too simple, really.

25:57.832 --> 25:59.233
Yeah, but that's... But it's, you know, if the 
focus is on the content and the focus on the

25:59.253 --> 26:21.604
learning plan and the focus on the textbook and the 
focus on third grade material, whatever in the

25:59.253 --> 26:21.604
world that is, instead of the focus on the learner 
and where the learner is and where the learner

25:59.253 --> 26:21.604
needs to go, that's the basic difference that I 
see. And in adult ed, What you're saying is that you

26:24.053 --> 26:28.379
tend to focus on the learner. We have to, because 
there are so many different places. And

26:31.302 --> 26:35.027
therefore, it's totally right. Does that make 
sense? Well, it makes sense to me. And it really is

26:37.791 --> 26:42.197
the way we used to do it, historically, in colonial 
era. A kid came to your school, or a teacher came

26:42.958 --> 26:53.892
through the mountains of West Virginia, and he 
stayed with the family, and he taught everybody as

26:42.958 --> 26:53.892
far as he could from where they were. And then he 
moved on to the next valley and did the same thing.

26:59.384 --> 27:07.176
So the focus was on the children and the learning 
and not on the holy content.

27:07.196 --> 27:09.339
It's just a matter of emphasis somehow to me. It's 
oversimplified, but it's a thing that really

27:09.419 --> 27:13.465
worries me. Now, the changes, of course, that are 
impending are not going to have as much effect,

27:15.869 --> 27:24.722
again, on your programs or your department. 
Because it's not going to change adult. Not unless

27:27.305 --> 27:30.629
the state gets into certification of ABE 
teachers. If the state gets into that

27:32.131 --> 27:36.437
certification, then our whole game will have to 
change it. Certification of adult? Adult basic ed

27:37.998 --> 27:40.341
teachers. Is that a possibility? I've been 
hearing noises about that for 11 years.

27:50.174 --> 27:51.115
How do you feel about it?

27:55.060 --> 27:55.541
I don't know. It wouldn't hurt to have some way of 
assuring that people who teach basic education to

27:56.543 --> 28:06.420
adults are going to treat them like adults. 
There's one famous story of a teacher here in San

28:07.322 --> 28:17.760
Antonio who taught children during the day and 
taught English to Mexican-American men at night,

28:07.322 --> 28:17.760
or Mexican men at night. And it came Thanksgiving, 
and she had her daytime kids coloring turkeys, so

28:18.668 --> 28:26.100
she asked them in to color turkeys, and nobody came 
back the next week. That's a true story. It's a sad

28:28.023 --> 28:29.085
story. So that I don't think it's really bad to have 
somebody, some way of assuring that the people are

28:30.206 --> 28:43.748
going to just change from looking at the content 
entirely to looking at the learner in relation to

28:30.206 --> 28:43.748
the content. On the other hand, I think the 
literacy volunteer programs are vital and alive

28:45.044 --> 29:03.922
and growing and doing it out of love and compassion 
and concern and getting law-abiding training and

28:45.044 --> 29:03.922
getting whatever the other one is, LCA, I think, 
Literacy Council of Maryland training. And I'd

29:04.983 --> 29:07.465
hate to kill that and bureaucratize that. So I 
speak with a fork in time.

29:13.872 --> 29:14.292
Okay. Now, how about some highlights? You've been 
there now 10 years at Texas A&M. And I know that you

29:19.842 --> 29:24.326
have made certain contributions that you must 
feel good about. You just mentioned the student,

29:24.386 --> 29:30.572
the quality of the students, and how you're seeing 
them perform. And the kinds of things that they're

29:30.632 --> 29:35.397
doing has to be one of your satisfactions. But are 
there any things that stand out, an insight, an

29:35.537 --> 29:43.485
anecdote, an observation that you might want to 
share? That's hard. I know. I'm sure there's lots.

29:47.830 --> 29:58.260
Or a highlight, maybe, of these last 10 years, 
other than the general student, working with the

29:47.830 --> 29:58.260
students. It sounds trite, but every student is a 
highlight. Some of them I'm joyfully getting rid

30:04.186 --> 30:07.869
of. Some of them, I really hate to see them go. I 
wrote. My students who are trying to graduate in

30:15.359 --> 30:34.009
May, a long letter to give them all the deadlines 
and stuff, and ended up with something like, I'm

30:15.359 --> 30:34.009
going to put my foot in your backside and joyfully 
push you out of the nest onto an unsuspecting

30:15.359 --> 30:34.009
world.
