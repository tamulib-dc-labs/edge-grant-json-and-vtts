WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:07.562
In January of 42, everything begins to get 
serious.

00:10.426 --> 00:16.274
What did you and your classmates, who did you all 
think was going to win this war? We had no doubt who

00:17.315 --> 00:21.981
was going to win the war. The United States had 
never lost a war at that point. I've always found

00:24.705 --> 00:30.072
today's students surprised at that fact. Many 
times I've had students say, but no, wait, y'all

00:34.027 --> 00:37.953
didn't, y'all weren't afraid. I said, no, as far as 
I know, our generation knew who would win it. We

00:42.641 --> 00:51.895
weren't, we didn't know how long it would take, but 
we knew what the outcome was going to be.

00:51.915 --> 00:58.185
How soon did any of your close acquaintances leave 
for active duty? None, as far as my close

01:00.072 --> 01:02.336
acquaintances did. Not until we graduated. And by 
and large, the student all went out. What we did is

01:10.349 --> 01:22.790
we graduate on the 30th day of January,

01:10.349 --> 01:22.790
and then the following Monday, we all volunteered 
for enlistment. And within In one or two weeks, we

01:27.038 --> 01:31.202
were all either in the Army. It was all Army then. In 
this accelerated routine, did the

01:35.226 --> 01:48.338
Aggie routine of hazing and all that, did that 
change? I suspect it did. I pulled out a lot of that

01:51.341 --> 01:53.503
stuff. I backed off. I didn't like it. I didn't mind 
being hazed myself. I guess I might have been, but I

01:58.009 --> 02:14.308
didn't think that was a thing that we ought to do, 
and I pulled out, and spending a lot of time in the

01:58.009 --> 02:14.308
Longhorn office and things of that sort, I sort of 
disappeared from the the long life times in the

02:15.571 --> 02:18.876
Corps itself. I had friends, but I didn't take care 
of them. I did accept the services of a freshman

02:22.603 --> 02:31.157
coming in and cleaning up the room. And you lived on 
the campus those last three, two and a half years.

02:37.868 --> 02:39.431
Two and a half years, right. Let's see. other 
wartime events that you remember hearing about

02:42.706 --> 02:49.834
them before you left the campus? I was on the staff. 
I was an associate editor of the Longhorn. And in

02:59.705 --> 03:09.135
the process, if you look back at the 1943

02:59.705 --> 03:09.135
Longhorn, you will find that there were that 
medals were medal winners were generally

03:09.925 --> 03:39.696
portrayed and honored and featured within that 
and so it was in that particular process that we

03:09.925 --> 03:39.696
began to understand that Aggies were dying and 
that Aggies were caught and People were out there

03:40.486 --> 04:02.072
fighting and

03:40.486 --> 04:02.072
it was then that I became very clearly aware, 
personally aware of the military and what was

03:40.486 --> 04:02.072
going on, battles that were going on. Do you 
remember when you first had a personal

04:03.132 --> 04:13.484
acquaintance or member of the family who was 
wounded or killed in action? Yes, I did. I hear

04:15.947 --> 04:16.788
about it. It wasn't any close family. None of those 
were killed. But people who were in Alney and in the

04:21.714 --> 04:30.925
church, I think, to the story you hear, have been 
lost.

04:30.945 --> 04:31.806
And we felt it.

04:34.790 --> 04:41.296
Let's see, I think I mentioned, any other events 
that you remember? Let's see, because D-Day comes

04:41.997 --> 04:46.421
after you're already gone from here. Oh, I know 
one. Was Muster held in your undergraduate days on

04:52.407 --> 04:58.012
campus that you recall?

05:03.137 --> 05:03.497
It must have been. All right, your answer is about 
like everyone else's before the war. I have the

05:09.177 --> 05:19.393
impression that muster was a low-key event until 
after the war, and the war made it much more

05:09.177 --> 05:19.393
meaningful. The war made it much more meaningful,

05:20.454 --> 05:24.841
right. And it was musters that you held when you 
were in the war, in the military, in the Imperial

05:24.861 --> 05:31.891
Hotel in Tokyo, for example. There you go. kinds of 
musters that you begin to remember. When you

05:36.736 --> 05:41.502
graduated in January of 43, was there a final 
review? There was a final review. Held? Yes.

05:45.729 --> 05:45.909
Where? In Drillfield. Oh, okay. Like all other 
forms. Okay. Do you have any idea who the reviewing

05:54.561 --> 05:58.447
officer was? Was anybody notable? No, as far as I 
know of, it was just the And commencement was held

06:04.717 --> 06:06.799
where?

06:09.581 --> 06:11.583
What family came for you? My mother and father 
came. They came. My brother came. No, I didn't.

06:22.072 --> 06:23.133
Just my mother and father. They were here. I loaded 
up all the clothing I had when they left. And I went

06:31.301 --> 06:33.002
back in the dormitory. Founder of the room and 
stayed there until the next Monday. And then you

06:37.750 --> 06:38.811
signed up? Then I went to Houston and we all signed 
up.

06:45.358 --> 06:53.426
At that point, how well prepared did you feel A&M 
had made you intellectually? What did you, what

06:54.167 --> 06:55.809
was your opinion? We had no question that we had one 
of the best educations that you could get. We had no

07:00.235 --> 07:05.841
way of knowing, but we were confident in our 
education intellectually. I thought it

07:06.682 --> 07:10.967
personally, I had a gated experience. Having the 
kind of experience I had, not a leadership

07:12.388 --> 07:29.247
experience, but having taken the courses in 
veterinary medicine, having taken chemistry,

07:12.388 --> 07:29.247
having associated with Paul Pearson, being 
associated on the staff of the Longhorn.

07:29.969 --> 07:41.281
And the only semester I did not distinguish was 
that last semester when I put in a lot of other time

07:29.969 --> 07:41.281
doing other things. And by that time, was your goal 
to be a university faculty member? Was that what

07:46.427 --> 07:48.329
you thought you wanted to be? I don't know what I 
thought. I came to Texas A&M to be a county agent.

07:55.777 --> 07:57.799
All right, so when you left for the war, That was 
another ball game. I figured that when I came back,

08:00.751 --> 08:09.863
I talked to Pearson, I knew it, that I would come 
back at least for graduate work.

08:14.148 --> 08:24.081
By the time I left, I think I was pretty clear that 
after this was all over, I was going to come back for

08:14.148 --> 08:24.081
graduate work. After I came back from the war, I had 
only one thing in mind, and that was to come back to

08:26.399 --> 08:30.364
Texas A&M and take a master's degree. But you had 
not zeroed in, in 43, zeroed in on being a faculty

08:31.606 --> 08:37.394
member. No. A faculty member, my mother probably 
said that she thought that I would end up teaching

08:39.036 --> 08:46.306
at Texas A&M. I never admitted it. I sort of smiled 
when she said that, but that was her...

08:58.630 --> 09:01.354
Let's see, back to some less important items. 
Senior boots, where did you get yours?

09:07.022 --> 09:09.145
Where everybody else got them. Oh, so they were new 
ones? They were new ones. Remember what they cost?

09:14.713 --> 09:15.875
No, I don't. Somehow the figure $30 or so. Did you 
keep them or did you pass them on? I kept them for a

09:21.784 --> 09:25.689
while, and then somehow in the process they were 
lost. So you didn't sell them to another? I didn't.

09:28.718 --> 09:39.489
What

09:28.718 --> 09:39.489
were the places of high living for a student when 
you were an undergraduate? Where did students go

09:39.509 --> 09:41.074
to party?

09:48.327 --> 09:48.908
Hard liquors? Hard liquors. Oh, okay. Hard 
liquors. Yesterday's Houston Chronicle had a big

09:53.334 --> 10:00.544
article about Aggies and other college students 
binge drinking. Do you remember many Aggies

10:02.367 --> 10:08.275
drinking until they got drunk when you were an 
undergraduate? I think everyone did during their

10:08.755 --> 10:10.958
career. Is that right? At least once or twice. 
Okay. Where did you all get the alcohol? Well, it

10:16.787 --> 10:17.828
was beer. Okay, where'd you get it?

10:22.345 --> 10:23.907
I probably bought it at Hard Liquors. At Hard 
Liquors, okay. All right, what about whiskey? You

10:26.870 --> 10:29.853
see, at that point, you could buy beer at Bryant. 
Right. Where did anybody get whiskey? Well,

10:36.060 --> 10:41.866
that's another story, and I had to come from some 
distance.

10:41.886 --> 10:42.026
Mm-hmm. I've not heard anybody mention a 
bootlegger. No, as far as I know, it was all beer.

10:47.761 --> 10:50.184
Mm-hmm. And... No hard whiskey, no hard drink at 
all. It was strictly bitter. And I've heard of a few

10:55.769 --> 11:07.882
after the war who would drive to Burleson County, 
to Whiskey Bridge, going to Snook, but I've not

10:55.769 --> 11:07.882
heard of anything before the war about much 
whiskey at all. It wasn't until Burleson County,

11:09.003 --> 11:16.131
though it wept, and it could get over there that 
people went over and... and bought their hard

11:16.482 --> 11:44.987
liquor drinks at that particular point when you 
were an undergraduate living in the core dorms was

11:16.482 --> 11:44.987
it common for a youngster to have beer in his room no 
i don't recall

11:16.482 --> 11:44.987
maybe one or two added but i don't recall anybody 
having beer in the dormitory as far as you were

11:16.482 --> 11:44.987
aware were there any places of ill repute in brazos 
county anybody houses i've not heard of any and

11:46.317 --> 12:11.785
uh... now you went to look to lagrange uh... now 
when you went downtown brian there were three four

11:46.317 --> 12:11.785
movies downtown brian uh... and that wasn't a lot 
more fun apparently then going to movie on the

11:46.317 --> 12:11.785
campus Were there other places downtown where 
Aggies would eat? Yeah, you could find a place to

12:17.556 --> 12:21.700
eat down there. There were several places. I don't 
recall their names. If your parents came to visit

12:26.826 --> 12:34.634
or any other relatives, where did you and they eat? 
Well, we probably went to the Aggieland Inn to eat.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.721
They're near Northgate. Let's see. Did you have 
any dates with Tessies while you were an

12:46.175 --> 12:50.780
undergraduate? No, so you didn't have the routine 
of getting them here and so forth.

12:59.089 --> 12:59.670
Let's see. Let's see. Tobacco. How many students 
smoked and what did they smoke?

13:14.067 --> 13:17.592
Oh, I smoked pipes and cigarettes. Not cigars? I 
don't recall. How many did? There were a number.

13:23.439 --> 13:23.599
Half? Half, maybe. Was it okay to smoke in your 
room? It was okay to smoke in the room. Couldn't

13:33.792 --> 13:35.114
smoke in the dining hall? No. Did people dip snuff 
or chew tobacco? Oh, yeah. Especially in Animal

13:44.003 --> 13:45.665
Sun. Oh, okay.

13:48.929 --> 13:56.918
Were you even aware of other drugs

13:48.929 --> 13:56.918
or other things to smoke then? No. Did you know even 
the word? I don't recall. I don't recall even

14:02.725 --> 14:04.587
knowing anything. Maybe I knew something about 
marijuana, but it was sort of something out in the

14:04.627 --> 14:12.897
distance that you just didn't touch that people 
did. You weren't aware that anybody here ever? No,

14:17.493 --> 14:21.499
I didn't know of anybody here.

14:22.581 --> 14:23.903
Let's say back to football. Describe any of those 
celebrity football players that were here your

14:25.746 --> 14:31.314
freshman year. What was your impression of them? 
Well, they were Kimbrough brothers. What were

14:37.343 --> 14:38.665
they like as people?

14:42.374 --> 14:43.135
They go to class.

14:45.838 --> 14:48.541
They were students. As a matter of fact, during the 
time that I was a student, I was a graduate student,

14:48.561 --> 14:58.592
the football team was in a corps right along with 
the student body, just sort of assembled. So you

15:00.074 --> 15:04.679
had football players in your so-called outfit. 
Now, when the athletes went to class, they wore

15:06.220 --> 15:10.305
their uniforms what?

15:15.348 --> 15:20.113
Silver Taps, was it held when you were a student? 
Yes. Where? The

15:21.415 --> 15:26.400
same place it was held now. Was it similar in style 
and manner? Similar

15:29.503 --> 15:34.989
in style, the same thing. Using that, what are the 
events that unify Aggies in feelings?

15:48.355 --> 15:55.465
The events, I'm not sure that there are, well, of 
course, Yale practice did. Okay. And the reviews,

15:58.268 --> 16:12.287
whether various and sundry times brought it in, of 
course, in the unifying situations.

16:15.541 --> 16:20.626
But mostly it was within each organization and in 
the classroom. It was in the classroom that you

16:20.646 --> 16:23.429
made your friends and carried on.

16:26.993 --> 16:36.783
Was there... Because majors generally followed 
the same classes, they were in the same classes. In

16:36.803 --> 16:41.768
terms of the way that you were accepted by your 
contemporaries, and the way you accepted your

16:43.148 --> 16:51.196
contemporaries, was there much distinction of 
family income? Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

16:56.301 --> 16:57.983
You didn't know what anybody made. You knew that 
some people were gathering, you know, cleaning

16:58.043 --> 17:08.633
and turning it back and forth,

17:10.790 --> 17:14.716
Did anybody... Did you just presume that they 
needed it? But this was... You never looked down on

17:14.736 --> 17:18.942
them or anything? I didn't see any, feel anything. 
The uniform took away a lot of that kind of thing.

17:30.500 --> 17:35.627
And the fact that you were Missouri Synod and 
somebody else was a Catholic or a Presbyterian?

17:36.108 --> 17:38.432
That didn't make any difference either. What 
about their last name? I don't know that that made a

17:41.806 --> 17:45.332
difference. Did you have some contemporaries 
that you knew that were... Well, you see, there

17:45.352 --> 17:52.605
were no blacks. But there were Hispanic. There 
were a few Hispanics, not many. Were there any from

17:57.874 --> 18:02.282
other countries that you remember? Not the 
undergraduate level. No, they were people from

18:06.747 --> 18:09.952
particular South America. That's what I thought. 
And as far as you knew, were they accepted? They

18:15.660 --> 18:16.120
were in the Corps. And they were accepted like 
everybody else, weren't they? Just like

18:19.946 --> 18:20.967
everybody else. Now, Melvin Maltz, Houston, who 
comes after the war, I asked him about nicknames,

18:20.987 --> 18:30.240
and he said that he, being Jewish, was called Jew 
Boy. And he said, I did not ever think of that as a

18:30.260 --> 18:34.206
put-down. He said, in fact, I was proud to be 
Jewish. Do you remember any incident of any sort?

18:43.577 --> 18:44.458
Maybe, I don't know.

18:48.765 --> 18:52.752
My nickname generally in the later years was 
Conker. Kunk. K-U-N-K. Just short of your name. I

18:59.550 --> 19:03.997
didn't use the term Harry until long after. 
Really? Now, when you were growing up in Olney,

19:06.020 --> 19:09.264
were you Harry? No, I was Harriet. Harriet. Okay. 
And I presume that's Germanic? Is that a German

19:16.355 --> 19:17.136
word?

19:20.086 --> 19:28.034
I changed

19:20.086 --> 19:28.034
the spelling of it when I went into the military.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.419
It changed from what to what? From h-a-r-i-o-t

19:33.480 --> 19:47.494
to h-r-r-i-o-t. Because I know the double r. 
That's what I knew you as. Let's see, oh, Bonfire.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.677
Bonfire was Bonfire. Where was it? It was on the 
drill field. And did you help ever? Not really, no.

19:59.424 --> 20:00.446
Not even as a freshman? There were boxes that were 
put up there. Okay. There weren't any tree trucks?

20:06.953 --> 20:08.975
No, no tree trucks or anything else. What was 
usually up on the very top of it? I don't recall.

20:14.922 --> 20:15.923
There wasn't an outhouse? There might have been. 
Oh, okay. Those were more after war. Okay.

20:26.291 --> 20:26.671
Let's see. I have here Hollywood. Was that after 
the war? No. The invasion of Hollywood came in in

20:34.719 --> 20:38.662
our senior year. And the movie, as you well know, 
had never been licked.

20:47.971 --> 20:49.392
And which... They

20:49.912 --> 21:16.695
came in, and I was enough of around, I was with the 
core, with the Longhorn, so I, at that point in

20:49.912 --> 21:16.695
time, I met with some of the people that were 
talking about the early stages of the game, and

20:49.912 --> 21:16.695
planning our, the film, and then when they came in, 
and of course, here and there, I appeared in the

20:49.912 --> 21:16.695
movie. How long were they here? in the filming. Two 
or three months. Is that right? Not very long. And

21:26.215 --> 21:30.361
you people on the campus knew they were here, knew 
it was being filmed. We were here and we used to

21:30.381 --> 21:34.026
watch the filming. Where

21:34.106 --> 21:38.773
did they do most of the filming? What parts of the 
campus did they capture most? Well, they captured

21:43.099 --> 21:45.642
what was known as the President's House. They 
captured, of course, Visa Hall. They captured the

21:50.223 --> 21:54.570
area's military walk. That area, they captured 
the area around the Claybrook Center, not the

21:54.590 --> 22:06.388
Claybrook, but the animal industry building 
there.

22:09.132 --> 22:13.899
And did some of y'all try to maneuver yourselves 
into it? Occasionally, to be seen in it, yes. Who

22:19.670 --> 22:23.035
were the most notable stars that y'all saw?

22:26.880 --> 22:27.882
Memory fails me. Was Mitchum in that? Robert 
Mitchum. And he was here on the campus? He was on the

22:33.089 --> 22:33.510
campus. He played a secondary part. Quine. 
Richard Quine. Yeah. Who was the lady? I don't

22:41.441 --> 22:42.243
remember. I've got the movie at home. I could look 
it up. Okay. Let's see, as you are preparing to

22:50.230 --> 22:57.460
leave the campus, you're getting ready to go to 
war. How well did you feel you were prepared for

22:58.582 --> 23:01.185
that? Well, I felt that I could do anything. The 
first thing we knew we were going to do was we were

23:08.335 --> 23:18.870
the first class that came along that didn't have 
the summer camp, which justified commissioning

23:08.335 --> 23:18.870
right off on graduation. We all had to go to Officer 
Kennedy School and had no particular problem

23:19.188 --> 23:26.900
going there. How did your Aggie experience 
benefit you there at OCS compared to the others?

23:40.441 --> 23:42.124
The rumor is that after they lined it up, the class, 
this one class of which we had mostly Aggies in it,

23:44.129 --> 23:51.779
most of the Aggies were in this one class. The rumor 
is that the military people, the officers,

23:53.261 --> 24:13.326
came up and as we, the first day they were there, 
they'd have people stand at attention and do the

23:53.261 --> 24:13.326
good old marine type of situation. As I say, the 
rumor is that they all got drunk because the Aggies

24:15.314 --> 24:26.205
just stood up against them and didn't seem to bow or 
anything of this sort. They didn't give in. Now

24:28.268 --> 24:31.791
where was OCS for you? Fort Sill. Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma. That is a rumor. I don't know what it is,

24:36.997 --> 24:42.823
but at any rate, I don't know whether that was it or 
perhaps Pretty easy time, you know, for a

24:42.989 --> 24:45.071
candidate school.

24:48.956 --> 24:52.660
Aggie Ring, when did you, and how much did it cost? 
When did you get your ring? My ring cost me $28. And

24:55.384 --> 24:59.108
when did I get it?

25:02.832 --> 25:06.957
I got it the mid-semester of my junior year. Okay. 
And literally had to hide it until All right, so

25:13.955 --> 25:16.858
because you were ahead in hours? I was ahead in 
hours. Okay, okay. Do you have any stories of your

25:20.943 --> 25:25.649
Aggie ring down through the years? I lost it once in 
a military restroom. Went back and found it on the

25:31.936 --> 25:33.558
floor. My, my. During the war? During the war. My, 
my. Where? Do you remember? Overseas? Macon,

25:42.433 --> 25:42.913
Georgia. Macon, Georgia. My, my. Do you still have 
it? Oh, yes. Any other stories about it? No, none

25:50.181 --> 25:51.583
particularly. Any where you were wearing it and 
somebody recognized it? Oh, yes. You always wore

25:55.227 --> 25:56.088
it. You wore it during the military. You took it 
overseas with you. That was one thing that you

25:58.731 --> 25:59.912
kept.

26:03.917 --> 26:11.265
I kept wearing it most of my life, except it got 
too... Then I transferred it to the right, and then

26:03.917 --> 26:11.265
I finally... got too large and it kept falling off 
and I quit wearing it as a result of that. Because

26:17.775 --> 26:22.827
I'm thinking that that's also one of those Aggie 
unifying features. That is a graduate unifying.

26:27.057 --> 26:27.839
There's no question about it. The ring is the one 
that And even today, with men and women, with a very

26:30.010 --> 26:43.710
small percentage of the student body being in the 
core, that ring is still the common unifying

26:30.010 --> 26:43.710
factor.

26:47.896 --> 26:50.379
Curiously, I'd have it in the room. I'd put it on at 
night when everybody was around. Take it off.

26:56.989 --> 26:58.311
Because I didn't dare wear it. The seniors would 
object. What are the qualities of being an Aggie?

27:07.788 --> 27:19.718
I think the quality of being an Aggie is

27:07.788 --> 27:19.718
a good deal of self-confidence.

27:23.321 --> 27:26.084
That somehow, I'm all right. What I do is okay.

27:31.756 --> 27:32.517
It lives with me. I had no trouble with courses. I 
had no trouble with studies. I felt I could do

27:39.347 --> 27:44.154
anything except be a military leader or be 
elected.

27:48.059 --> 27:51.664
And I think that's partly my personality that I 
had.

27:54.508 --> 27:58.274
I was sort of a squeaky voice fellow. I didn't gain 
my loud voice until I got into the military itself,

28:02.080 --> 28:09.111
and had to, and somebody said, sound

28:02.080 --> 28:09.111
off.

28:12.356 --> 28:26.519
There was also a,

28:12.356 --> 28:26.519
probably a kind of arrogance, too,

28:12.356 --> 28:26.519
that it was better. You're saying... Yeah, you're 
saying that it's more than just confidence.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.001
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

28:41.108 --> 28:42.550
Mm-hmm.

28:50.963 --> 28:56.792
Mm-hmm.

29:01.075 --> 29:07.882
And they were confident that your education was

29:01.075 --> 29:07.882
first class. Now, you must have known when you 
came, you must have known a few Aggie graduates.

29:15.129 --> 29:15.409
Yes. Do you now realize that you saw that kind of 
quality in them too, some of those qualities? Yes,

29:25.679 --> 29:26.340
I think so. That's the reason why I guess I came to 
A&M. is that I came across those people

29:29.830 --> 29:43.950
that

29:29.830 --> 29:43.950
carried on that kind of confidence, knew them.

29:47.575 --> 29:52.122
And you never thought about going anywhere else, 
transferring? I did earlier, yes. No, no, I mean

29:53.163 --> 29:54.926
once you enrolled here. Once enrolled? Oh, no. No, 
I was most disappointed. Joe Cole, who left the

29:59.699 --> 30:07.186
early part of us here and went to Texas Tech, I 
couldn't see. I just said, you're going for an

30:07.226 --> 30:11.590
inferior education. You just don't have any guts. 
It takes guts to come around here and live here. It

30:18.537 --> 30:23.321
takes a certain amount of courage.

30:23.341 --> 30:26.044
All right, as you look back,

30:29.095 --> 30:39.510
What did it mean to you, to your life, that you came 
to Texas A&M?

30:39.531 --> 30:45.199
Well, I don't know that I ever questioned

30:39.531 --> 30:45.199
what it meant to me. I accepted that I was a graduate 
of Texas A&M, and this opened certain doors for me.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.294
I graduated immediately. I went into the military 
and of course Aggies were respected in the

30:55.314 --> 31:06.850
military.

31:06.870 --> 31:17.665
We were,

31:06.870 --> 31:17.665
it meant,

31:06.870 --> 31:17.665
I don't know. which is sort of a part of life that you 
had. You were there. You were an Aggie, so...

31:23.122 --> 31:30.894
All right, I've got two other questions 
scheduled. Did you hear anybody else say that? Oh,

31:33.077 --> 31:33.398
yes. Oh, yes.

31:36.883 --> 31:40.168
What have we not talked about about your student 
days that we should have? Well, I told you I think

31:42.372 --> 31:45.897
about everything that I needed to.
