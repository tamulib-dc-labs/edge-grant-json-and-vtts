WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:25.178
apartment did you have any rugs no bare floors what 
about throw rugs what about curtains well

00:02.765 --> 00:25.178
curtains we made out of i made them out of sheets you 
know just cut them up that i think the color sheets

00:02.765 --> 00:25.178
came up or did my mother dye those i don't remember i 
know she gave us curtains for the kitchen And I made

00:26.609 --> 00:29.052
the others for the bedrooms. And we just did 
improvise with whatever we could. And the kitchen

00:35.842 --> 00:38.846
stove, how many burners? I think there were four 
burners, but it was a small stove. But it had an

00:43.493 --> 00:44.855
oven. Uh-huh. And your washing machine. yeah i had 
i had a washing machine that we had that was ours an

00:46.792 --> 01:14.419
old roller yeah but did it have rinse tubs or did you 
use the no we used to sink they had deep sinks i guess

00:46.792 --> 01:14.419
that's why they built them and then the you had a 
solar a solar dryer out in the sun yes you had to hang

00:46.792 --> 01:14.419
the clothes out in the sun where did where did what 
advice did any of your neighbor friends give you as

00:46.792 --> 01:14.419
you moved in did any of them Well, just said that we 
had to be patient and loving and says, don't fuss at

01:14.787 --> 01:23.159
your husband and try to make it easy. And we tried to 
help each other and talk to each other about that.

01:28.006 --> 01:33.373
And one of the funniest things, they laugh about 
the introduction I had. When they came to welcome

01:34.755 --> 01:42.246
me and all of that, it was late in the evening and I 
had put some cabbage on to cook.

01:44.707 --> 01:49.332
And I think I turned the fire low. But anyway, we 
went out and sat on the grass, and pretty soon we

01:49.372 --> 01:53.536
started smelling. Oh, what's burning, and what's 
burning, and what's burning? And even the

01:58.121 --> 02:05.729
students that were coming kind of late from the 
library, it was a burn. And then all of a sudden,

02:06.009 --> 02:09.533
down on me, I think it's my cabbage. I ran in there, 
and they said, oh, what an introduction to the

02:10.778 --> 02:15.504
neighborhood. I stunk about. And almost all of the 
other couples were veterans. Were veterans. And

02:26.898 --> 02:28.420
did most of them have children? Yes. Helen, the 
Darings had one, and the Cantrells had one.

02:34.768 --> 02:36.330
Lippincott had one. And we had one, which we were 
the closest one. Of course, back of us lived Peter.

02:45.911 --> 02:49.077
I can't think of their last name. But anyway, he 
came and played with Robert was so funny. That wall

02:55.987 --> 03:05.380
was so thin that at night Peter used to wake up and 
say, Mama, Mama, and I'd jump out and go in to see

02:55.987 --> 03:05.380
about Robert and he'd be sound asleep. But we could 
hear everything. Coming through the wall. Did you

03:11.970 --> 03:17.678
all begin to share things? Oh yes. We had to, mostly 
the, Francis and Cantrell and Buddy, we became

03:19.088 --> 03:30.068
good close friends, very close friends. And 
Francis' cousin, Yay Larry, first cousin, was a

03:30.349 --> 03:37.041
football player and a baseball player. That's how 
we got in the games. And he liked Mexican food. So my

03:42.531 --> 03:51.188
mother would send us corn tortillas and she'd send 
us care packages, corn tortillas and beans and

03:42.531 --> 03:51.188
rice. And so, and then one time that I went home I 
brought the chili the red chili to make

04:01.090 --> 04:03.477
enchiladas. And ground meat was what we could 
afford. So we made it with peas and corn and

04:07.248 --> 04:16.534
potatoes, anything we could put together. About 
every two weeks, Francis and I, we would fix a

04:16.514 --> 04:31.602
Mexican supper and we would have Ye Larry and my 
brother Carlos, who was in school here, come over

04:16.514 --> 04:31.602
and eat with us. And we had enchiladas and rice and 
beans.

04:37.709 --> 04:42.055
But we, of course, iced tea and we had a good time. 
And like I said, that's the way we got into football

04:42.135 --> 04:46.301
games and baseball games because. All right, 
describe your impression when you first went to an

04:46.321 --> 04:51.067
Aggie football game. Well, I had been before 
because my brothers were here. At

04:57.149 --> 05:09.467
that time, when we came to football games, I may 
have been in elementary school when my brother was

04:57.149 --> 05:09.467
here, or in junior high, when my first brother was 
here. He graduated in 39.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.958
They did all of this yelling and all of that. They 
never sat down. So when Ralph came, I was already

05:19.321 --> 05:24.709
used to all of that. Now where did, when you all went 
to the games as a married couple, where did, were

05:25.347 --> 05:32.194
you over in the student section? Uh huh. And did you 
take Robert with you? Yes. And you stood up? We

05:36.159 --> 05:36.799
stood up. And did married folks kiss after Aggie 
touchdowns? Oh yes. Yes. Do you remember any

05:44.548 --> 05:51.996
incidents, any special moments during that first 
football season? No, let's see, I forget who was

05:52.718 --> 05:57.905
the quarterback. Was it Bob Smith? No, he was a good 
running back. Glenn Lippman. Glenn Lippman was a,

06:03.834 --> 06:07.599
uh-huh. From where was he from? Anyway, all of 
those, and C.J. Larry was a running back. And we got

06:16.799 --> 06:27.873
the tickets and we'd go, you know, Francis and 
myself and Ralph and Buddy and Carl, the little

06:16.799 --> 06:27.873
boy, and Robert, our son. And I don't know whether 
Ralph showed you the pictures of Carl and Robert.

06:35.704 --> 06:37.306
We'd go to the games. And then when Eisenhower was 
here,

06:42.668 --> 06:43.594
That's Robert. Oh, how good, how good. That's 
splendid. That was in 1951

06:49.874 --> 06:56.060
when he was here. And this is Carl. And see, there's 
Bonnie Lippincott and Robert and, no, that's

06:58.443 --> 07:07.772
Susan Darin. Bonnie Lippincott, Susan Darin, 
Robert and Carl. Eisenhower was here. Now what was

07:13.938 --> 07:16.000
the purpose of his visit? He was a general and they 
had... So he came... Yes. This is before he was

07:20.061 --> 07:21.502
politicking. Yes. He came here as a general. And it 
was cold. It must have been in February. I don't

07:28.851 --> 07:33.397
have a date because this was out of the Houston 
Post. I didn't cut out the date or the... And did you

07:38.002 --> 07:41.369
go to see Eisenhower? Yeah, it was in the drill 
field. The Corps was in review for him, and he was in

07:43.533 --> 07:49.264
the reviewing stand. What was your impression of 
him, of Eisenhower? Oh, I liked him. I thought he

07:53.813 --> 07:59.183
was just a great man.

08:01.357 --> 08:10.386
During that first year, what was a typical, 
describe a typical class day routine for you and

08:01.357 --> 08:10.386
your husband? You all got up about what time? Well, 
we got up about 6.30 or 7, because Ralph had to be in

08:12.168 --> 08:24.420
class by 8, and got up and fixed his breakfast, and 
he got ready and left. What was a normal breakfast?

08:26.762 --> 08:29.845
Oh, a normal breakfast, then we could get pullet 
eggs. And my mother sometimes would send us bacon.

08:34.805 --> 08:39.532
And it was just really toast and eggs. And I got my 
mother, every time we went, because she'd send us a

08:39.672 --> 08:49.665
lot of jelly and stuff that we had. And that was it, 
and coffee. Or sometimes we had cereal. And then

08:56.374 --> 08:59.038
when Robert got up, he always had oatmeal. and I 
would feed him and I would eat with him. And then

09:04.740 --> 09:07.163
Ralph would be off to class by eight. Before eight, 
because he had classes at eight o'clock. And

09:12.549 --> 09:20.297
either we stayed there and Robert would go on and 
play with all the kids. They played by the side of

09:20.337 --> 09:21.919
the house. And we'd just kind of watch them and we 
had anything to do, well, we'd get done. And then it

09:30.846 --> 09:35.433
was time for him to take a nap. Of course, Ralph 
would come home for lunch. And if he had classes or a

09:37.917 --> 09:41.122
lab in the afternoon, he would go. And if not, he'd 
go to the library and study. And he would study at

09:43.585 --> 09:44.787
home. And so we had to be quiet while they were 
studying. And we just tried to keep each other

09:54.284 --> 09:56.406
company, the wives. Then it was time for supper, 
and we had our supper, and then the kids played a

09:56.927 --> 10:11.263
little bit, and we'd sit around watching them 
play, and the men would be studying. Time to go to

10:12.364 --> 10:15.868
bed, and then the next day was the same routine. 
What did you women do to relax? Well, I guess we took

10:22.803 --> 10:25.761
naps. We played cards. um and that was about it we 
just kind of visited with each other and played

10:29.232 --> 10:54.852
cards and and took naps and we helped out when we if 
one was sick or something we tried to help each

10:29.232 --> 10:54.852
other because everybody was equally poor yes 
everybody was getting the same paycheck there

10:29.232 --> 10:54.852
were a few that were getting help from home maybe 
almost all on the gi bill oh yes And rent was $30?

10:56.621 --> 10:57.222
$30. Did that include utilities? Everything. $30 
included the refrigerator and the stove and the

11:02.368 --> 11:08.895
utilities. Oh, I forgot. Describe the air 
conditioning system. Oh, we didn't have one. The

11:15.362 --> 11:25.193
windows were where you could get a stick and go 
outside and pull that flap up. and you know, tied

11:25.915 --> 11:28.339
up. Of course it had the screen, but that was, we did 
have a fan that my mother gave us, but that was all.

11:38.075 --> 11:39.016
No air conditioning. So you had one fan? Mm-hmm. So 
you could use it? In the kitchen or the hallway and

11:42.807 --> 11:48.314
then in the bedroom. Right. Then let's make 
believe that on a Saturday night you all wanted to

11:49.756 --> 11:58.667
do something kind of special for entertainment. 
What would you do? I think we may have gone to maybe

12:00.269 --> 12:11.042
some picture shows, some movies, because we could 
go to Guyon for 25 cents or 15 cents. And that's how

12:12.473 --> 12:16.468
we got acquainted with Mr. Putty. And at the end of 
the sophomore year when we were in Vet Village,

12:23.695 --> 12:29.601
Ralph had gone all over the college looking for a 
part-time job and couldn't get one because we were

12:23.695 --> 12:29.601
getting the money. And so Mr. Putty, no, one of the 
boys or something, one of the students that worked

12:29.641 --> 12:49.003
there was going summer camp or something, and he 
taught Ralph how to do the projector, and Mr. Putty

12:29.641 --> 12:49.003
helped him out. And so when he had somebody out, he 
would call on Ralph. to do that and I think he did

12:53.648 --> 13:01.635
that the last two months, April and May of the 
sophomore year when we were here. And then at the

13:03.076 --> 13:22.913
end of May, Mr. Smith called him or wrote to him and 
told him that he would like for him to come and take a

13:03.076 --> 13:22.913
summer job so his employees could go on vacation 
and he trusted Ralph take over. So we gave up the

13:24.958 --> 13:35.386
apartment and we stored the furniture, I believe. 
And we moved to to San Antonio and got a little

13:41.219 --> 13:47.288
efficiency place and he worked and of course we 
saved the money. And then we tried to get back into

13:48.069 --> 13:50.613
Vet Village. They were getting ready to tear that 
down. So they assigned us to College View. And we

13:57.062 --> 14:03.552
moved into College View and his uncle had given him 
a refrigerator. So we brought our own

14:04.132 --> 14:06.636
refrigerator. And we set up in College View, we had 
Lewis and Margaret Springer for our neighbors,

14:07.595 --> 14:18.650
and Wallace and Irene Larson. They were 
veterinary students, but we got real close with

14:18.791 --> 14:22.376
them. And the Beige, Helen Beige and her husband. 
And she had an automatic washing machine. her

14:32.570 --> 14:40.040
family had given her an automatic washing machine 
and by that time I had started working at Guyon

14:32.570 --> 14:40.040
Hall. So I had a little bit of money and she would do 
my laundry for 25 cents a load.

14:48.731 --> 14:50.553
But it still had to be hung out. So she would do the 
laundry and I would hang it out because I didn't

14:50.653 --> 14:57.101
come to work till about one o'clock. The theater 
wasn't open till then. So I came to work at one. So

15:02.692 --> 15:13.184
she would do the laundry and I'd hang it up, and then 
she would bring it in, because I worked till five

15:02.692 --> 15:13.184
o'clock, and if somebody wanted to use the line or 
the clothes were dry, we had to. So you worked every

15:13.884 --> 15:15.366
afternoon? Every afternoon. What was your pay, do 
you remember? I think I got

15:18.229 --> 15:25.337
like 60 cents an hour. And what was your task? I was 
the ticket, sold the tickets, the ticket sales

15:27.679 --> 15:31.804
lady. So afternoon, not in the evening though? No, 
in the afternoon. We were two. One week I worked the

15:38.780 --> 15:44.208
evening from 1 to 5, and then the other would work 
from 5 on. And then the next week we'd switch. I

15:46.892 --> 15:54.703
would come in at 5 and she'd come in at 1, so that we 
had the same thing. Who took care of Robert while

15:54.937 --> 15:57.100
you were? Well, we had a lady in the next barrack 
that did babysitting. And she kept Robert until

16:02.229 --> 16:05.374
Ralph got home. And then, of course, when Ralph was 
a senior was when Robert started school. We had to

16:15.450 --> 16:19.957
pay for him to go to school because he wasn't quite 
six. And he started at A&M Consolidated. And at

16:23.422 --> 16:27.388
that time, I was having trouble with hemorrhoids. 
And of course, we'd go home to Dr. Langster. Every

16:31.674 --> 16:38.663
time we went home, he'd check us over, all three of 
us, and gave us medication or samples or whatever

16:31.674 --> 16:38.663
we needed. So I went to him. It was before 
Thanksgiving. And in one of the hemorrhoids, I had

16:43.110 --> 16:46.154
a little growth. And he was very concerned. And he 
said, I know it's going to be a hardship on you all.

16:53.240 --> 17:07.779
And, but he says, I need to do the surgery right 
away, as soon as we can, because he didn't want, you

16:53.240 --> 17:07.779
know, anything to happen, or he was concerned. So 
we moved out of College View in November of 52, and I

17:07.839 --> 17:18.032
went back to Beeville. And we stored our 
furniture. My dad had built two bedrooms onto the

17:22.363 --> 17:29.772
garage and a bathroom, but we weren't using one. I 
think two of my brothers were still at home. They

17:33.196 --> 17:36.960
were in high school, and they slept in one of the 
bedrooms. So we stored our furniture there and

17:37.501 --> 17:41.886
moved in with mother. And I had surgery. Dr. 
Langston said, let's wait until after Christmas.

17:46.956 --> 17:50.522
So I think I had surgery in January of 53. And

17:50.562 --> 17:58.513
I got well, and of course I went to work for my dad. I 
mean, I worked for dad in the office to help him out

17:58.553 --> 18:03.240
until Ralph graduated. Now did you take Robert 
home with you? Yes, I took Robert home. He had

18:07.234 --> 18:14.283
started at A&M Consolidated, but then I took him 
home and he went to school in Burklair with my

18:07.234 --> 18:14.283
sister. My sister was teaching there. So he went to 
school in Burklair his first year. Well, he went

18:19.029 --> 18:23.575
here until November and then the rest of the year he 
went. All right, during the years that you were

18:23.605 --> 18:31.034
here, describe shopping in Bryan College 
Station. Where'd you go grocery shopping? We went

18:32.636 --> 18:39.225
to Safeway and to the Atlantic store, whichever 
had the, we'd watch the sales, each one of them.

18:39.245 --> 18:44.972
We'd get together, the wives get together, oh, 
this is on sale at Atlantic, this is on sale at

18:39.245 --> 18:44.972
Safeway. So really what we got was staples, 
coffee, rice, beans, vermicelli. And they were

18:54.127 --> 18:55.532
both downtown? Downtown, uh-huh. And we'd go into 
Bryan and buy, and really, clothes, whenever I

18:57.085 --> 19:06.981
went to Beeville, my mother would, you know, we'd 
go buy clothes there. And my brother in Puerto Rico

19:07.042 --> 19:14.133
had, he and his father-in-law had shoe stores all 
over the island. So he would send me some name brand

19:14.534 --> 19:17.178
shoes. Of course, they don't have this narrow 
size, and I wear a, triple toe and quite him. But he

19:25.394 --> 19:34.513
would send the name brand, maybe in a B, but he said, 
take them to the store and he'd write, and they will

19:25.394 --> 19:34.513
exchange them. And they did that. So he would send 
me the shoe and he would send Ralph and Robert

19:37.780 --> 19:42.330
shoes, of course they could wear them. But I 
couldn't wear mine, but he would send the name

19:43.087 --> 19:48.514
brand, and I'd take them into a shoe store in Bryan. 
Where, if you needed something quickly, some kind

19:49.595 --> 19:54.622
of groceries, was there any? We went to the, well, 
when we were here, we went to the little store on.

19:59.528 --> 20:05.075
The corner of what is now University in Texas? 
Well, no, that was when we lived in Collegeview.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.562
But there was one up here. You know where Brothers 
are? Right in that area, what was the name of that

20:17.221 --> 20:20.609
little grocery store? There was a barber shop. Oh, 
you're saying at Southgate? Yeah, Southgate. No,

20:27.485 --> 20:29.209
is it Southgate? Yes, yes, Southgate. That's 
where the Little Grocery Store. And if we needed

20:33.468 --> 20:38.235
something, we'd run over there and get it. When we 
were in College View, we went to the Little Grocery

20:38.636 --> 20:50.293
Store and if we ran out of something and last week we 
had to have something, we could charge it. And then

20:51.274 --> 20:56.682
at the first of the month, he knew that at the first 
of the month all the veterans got paid. But we

20:57.809 --> 21:00.854
learned to cook the ground meat with everything. 
And, of course, sometimes we would get chicken

21:00.874 --> 21:09.727
because they would sell the chickens here, well, 
reasonable. Now, you said you went to the Baptist

21:10.588 --> 21:12.831
church. You mentioned that you had, did you grow up 
a Methodist? No, I grew up a Catholic. You grew up

21:19.401 --> 21:20.142
Catholic. What about Ralph? Catholic. Okay. Why 
Baptist? Well, when I went to live with Miss Hall,

21:28.387 --> 21:32.673
He was a Baptist deacon and she was a Sunday school 
teacher in the Baptist church. And they knew I came

21:34.075 --> 21:38.040
from a Catholic. They never did ask me or anything, 
but I would ask them if I could go with them. So I

21:46.252 --> 21:48.775
really wasn't The reason we were not strong or 
devout Catholics was because my mother married my

21:50.645 --> 21:57.572
father who was a Methodist. Those Methodist 
missionaries, his mother and father were

21:59.233 --> 22:08.242
Methodists, and of course my father and his 
sisters were Methodists. And my mother married a

22:10.604 --> 22:12.486
Methodist. So when she married him, she was 
excommunicated from the Catholic Church. And it

22:19.754 --> 22:31.873
hurt my grandfather and grandmother very much 
because my grandfather had built that Catholic

22:19.754 --> 22:31.873
church in Berkeley and he was such a devout 
Catholic and so was my grandmother. The priest ate

22:31.913 --> 22:38.944
at her house on Sundays when he'd go in from Goliad 
to Berkeley for Mass. But my mother could not

22:39.683 --> 22:42.849
practice her religion. But my grandfather and 
grandmother, being devout Catholics, they would

22:43.611 --> 22:48.160
baptize. My father didn't object because we lived 
next door to them. But we were not given the

22:54.415 --> 23:00.963
Catholic training like catechism and all of that. 
And so actually, when I went to live, we'd go to

23:00.983 --> 23:04.407
Mass. We'd go to, we never did go to the catechism 
classes. But my grandfather, in his last five

23:12.056 --> 23:21.047
years of life, he had houses for rent there in 
Berkeley. and there was this missionary that came

23:22.580 --> 23:45.263
from the Assembly of God and established a little 
church there with some families that were

23:22.580 --> 23:45.263
dissatisfied with the priest and they were big 
families like they had nine kids and there were

23:22.580 --> 23:45.263
four families and each with nine or ten kids so that 
made a good congregation and my and he I talked to my

23:46.070 --> 23:48.333
grandfather for a long time. My grandfather was 
converted into the Assembly of God Church about

23:49.155 --> 23:54.864
four years before he died. And my grandmother kept 
on being a good Catholic, but because of his

23:56.987 --> 24:11.730
memory, it was so funny, she'd take us to Mass and 
then at 9.45 we'd go to Sunday school at the

23:56.987 --> 24:11.730
Assembly of God Church. And that's how I got that 
Training. So when you all came here. We were both, I

24:19.264 --> 24:25.131
had joined the Baptist Church like in 1940. Oh, 
okay, so you were. 1944. You already were a

24:29.736 --> 24:31.318
Baptist. Uh-huh. Okay. And when I married Ralph, 
we married in the Baptist Church, and then we

24:32.479 --> 24:44.393
dedicated Robert in the Baptist Church, and then 
he joined about a year later. Describe this

24:44.525 --> 24:51.396
congregation and what it was like to be a young 
married couple in the First Baptist Church. Well,

24:51.416 --> 24:57.827
there were a lot of student members there, and I 
can't think of Dr. Richardson. Well, Dr. Brown was

24:59.089 --> 25:07.343
the minister there, but they had gotten a new one 
because there was so much controversy. They had

25:08.538 --> 25:11.181
been kind of like dissatisfied with it. But I think 
it was Dr. Rich that was the pastor then, and his

25:12.702 --> 25:24.274
wife taught a Sunday school class of young women 
that were, most of them were students. So I joined

25:24.875 --> 25:33.043
that class, and Ralph joined a class, and of course 
Robert was in Sunday school.

25:34.981 --> 25:40.990
And Ralph was an usher, and sometimes I helped in 
the nursery.

25:43.314 --> 25:46.779
And we just had, I mean, we enjoyed. We couldn't 
wait to Sunday to go to Sunday school. And Dr. Berry

25:52.708 --> 25:57.796
was the superintendent of the Sunday schools. I 
can remember him very well.

26:02.369 --> 26:06.180
Miss Pugh was Robert's Sunday School class 
teacher. Mrs. Marion Pugh. Marion Pugh's wife.

26:09.951 --> 26:13.240
And then the summer of 52,

26:15.228 --> 26:24.378
We didn't go to San Antonio, Ralph State to go to 
summer school, and I helped with the Vacation Mile

26:15.228 --> 26:24.378
School. I helped Miss Pugh with the Vacation Mile 
School. And I remember we had Coach, Gail,

26:26.901 --> 26:32.567
Stanky's twins in there, and they were horrible. 
And that's about what we did, but in our family, my

26:34.369 --> 26:41.877
father wouldn't, object to us being whatever. 
Because I have a brother that's Episcopalian. I

26:50.278 --> 26:52.982
have two brothers that are Presbyterians. I have a 
brother that's a Baptist. And I think only two are

26:59.672 --> 27:02.837
Catholic. No, just one is Catholic. Did anyone 
ever tease you being Hispanic and Baptist? Did

27:10.940 --> 27:11.782
anybody ever? Well they were all surprised and 
they still are. You know I'm the librarian in a

27:14.970 --> 27:19.542
little Catholic school. Of course, they have 
changed a lot. I mean, they don't go to confession

27:22.586 --> 27:26.070
anymore and they don't do a lot of things. And like I 
told Sister, I said, it looks like I'm sitting in a

27:26.170 --> 27:29.895
Baptist church. But when I went there and the other 
teachers found out I was Baptist, did you become a

27:31.517 --> 27:39.867
Baptist? What were your parents, you know? And 
when I tell them about the recent experience, we

27:47.230 --> 27:54.482
weren't brought up as devout Catholic was because 
of my mother being excommunicated from the

27:47.230 --> 27:54.482
Catholic Church. Of course, they don't do that 
now, but at that time. Now, I haven't sensed in

27:57.927 --> 28:07.683
anything you've said anybody teasing or doing 
anything negative that you were Hispanic. No.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.126
That you were fully accepted everywhere. No. And 
as y'all are living in Vet Village and in College

28:11.277 --> 28:25.823
View, did y'all ever think about stopping and 
going back to San Antonio? No. So you never looked

28:26.884 --> 28:28.547
back? No. Were there any semesters when the grades 
were marginal? Oh, yes. Is that right? And

28:36.758 --> 28:51.081
sometimes, you know, I knew he was having a hard 
time because I had, you know, gone through junior

28:36.758 --> 28:51.081
college and then University of Mexico, and I knew 
how hard it was. And I knew he was worried about his

28:51.261 --> 29:00.336
grandmother because she died when we were living 
at Bed Village, and she raised him. And thinking

29:01.362 --> 29:09.496
about his mother and not being in school for so 
long. I knew it was going to be a struggle for him,

29:10.017 --> 29:19.995
but I don't think I ever complained about his 
grades. And he didn't flunk anything? No. No, he

29:23.132 --> 29:24.534
didn't flunk anything. And he told me about 
changing his major to marketing. Did he discuss

29:29.402 --> 29:30.945
that with you? Yes. And you endorsed the...

29:38.637 --> 29:43.646
The wives had talked about, you know, we need to 
support our husbands. They've been through a war.

29:46.368 --> 29:51.096
They've been, some of them, you know, had had a hard 
life. They had to work when they were kids and all of

29:51.617 --> 29:53.941
that. So we just figured that we talked about it. We 
have to support them in whatever endeavor. I mean,

30:01.754 --> 30:06.823
if they want to change their majors or maybe they 
want to stay an extra year. so and uh just about

30:08.457 --> 30:32.322
every one of the couples were first generation 
college students all short of money uh some from

30:08.457 --> 30:32.322
small towns but some from the city city almost all 
were texans i yes i think so all of our neighbors i

30:08.457 --> 30:32.322
think were from texas now We did have a neighbor way 
down the street, and she and I became friends

30:32.673 --> 30:41.282
because she was from Canada. And she was a little 
bit, she dressed a little bit different than we

30:41.322 --> 30:45.806
did. She spoke a little bit different, and she was 
kind of chubby. And I don't know why she was

30:50.471 --> 30:55.216
comfortable with me, but she'd come to the house 
and visit with me. Now, she didn't socialize. And

30:58.098 --> 31:02.663
even when her mother was visiting her here,

31:05.039 --> 31:09.075
she would bring her mother and we'd visit. And I 
wish I had kept their name, but they were there,

31:09.663 --> 31:15.791
just lived one year, and they moved. But he had met 
her in Canada when he was in the service.

31:22.679 --> 31:29.448
And there weren't any special social events for 
student wives? No. Well, there were some at the

31:31.310 --> 31:37.678
YMCA that you could do, but we never did – I never did 
go. down there, you could go there for, now we did

31:37.996 --> 31:44.797
have, my Sunday school class had meetings at 
night. Oh, okay. You know, and I'd go to those. The

31:50.394 --> 31:51.297
WMU.
