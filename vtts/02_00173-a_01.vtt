00:02.427 --> 00:05.692
Testing, testing, one, two, three, four, one, two, three.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.437
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.529
This is a bright sunny Wednesday, March the 7th.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.993
I'm at 906 North Avenue in Bryan.

00:18.554 --> 00:23.362
I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Professor Frank Pierce.

00:24.484 --> 00:28.671
To introduce yourself to anyone who might hear this tape or read the transcription,

00:29.292 --> 00:33.841
Describe where he grew up, went to high school, college.

00:33.922 --> 00:38.270
Describe Frank Pierce before joining the faculty at Texas A&M.

00:38.290 --> 00:39.353
Go as long as you'd like.

00:39.613 --> 00:45.245
Well, I was born in Edwardsville, Illinois, which is about 20 miles from St.

00:45.265 --> 00:46.828
Louis, Missouri.

00:46.808 --> 00:55.155
And I grew up there and had the advantages of a small bedroom community, as it was called, and the advantages of going to St.

00:56.196 --> 01:07.485
Louis for all manner of musical and theatrical programs and for doctors and shopping, things of that nature.

01:09.787 --> 01:11.429
I attended the Edwardsville High School.

01:11.529 --> 01:16.393
I was interested in a great many things.

01:18.044 --> 01:25.272
music, art, drama.

01:25.292 --> 01:37.585
I was in the band and the orchestra and drum major from the time I was in junior high school to the time I graduated in the band.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.330
I went to the University of Illinois

01:43.289 --> 01:52.135
where I started out in architecture and hoping to be a theatrical designer.

01:53.566 --> 02:01.975
But then my eyes gave out on me from the intensive rendering I had to do.

02:02.396 --> 02:06.019
And so I then decided to change majors.

02:06.340 --> 02:16.671
And I considered mathematics, which was always an easy subject for me up until the time I hit analytical geometry.

02:18.288 --> 02:29.985
And then if it hadn't been that my brother was teaching at the University of Illinois in the electrical engineering department, and my

02:30.742 --> 02:33.765
roommate that semester, I would have never pulled through.

02:33.805 --> 02:49.721
He wouldn't work my problems for me, but he would ask me one question that I could answer, and then he would ask me the next harder question and make me reason between them.

02:51.523 --> 02:55.467
And so I finally forgot about

02:57.016 --> 03:01.095
mathematics and ended up in speech with a minor in English.

03:03.165 --> 03:06.520
Then I discovered that I had a speech defect from a fall.

03:08.474 --> 03:12.158
when I was three years old going down the stairs on my kiddie car.

03:13.680 --> 03:23.471
It had damaged my hearing in my right ear and caused me a partial paralysis of the right side of the face.

03:23.511 --> 03:33.722
My tongue moved at different speeds, so I had to learn how to pronounce the S sound because I didn't pronounce that properly.

03:35.373 --> 03:47.506
Then I went home after I graduated and told my father I was going to get a job, and he said, no, you're going to get a master's degree.

03:47.526 --> 03:50.849
Your brother got a master's degree, and you're going to get a master's degree.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.152
What was your father's occupation?

03:53.172 --> 03:54.934
He did many things.

03:55.014 --> 03:59.018
He was the closest thing to a genius that I ever met.

04:00.230 --> 04:03.754
and he could take things apart and put them back together again.

04:03.794 --> 04:06.637
He could do anything with his hands.

04:07.118 --> 04:08.819
My brother took after him.

04:12.083 --> 04:23.115
He was self-educated, and I never saw the man sit down with—out picking up a book or a newspaper or a magazine.

04:24.277 --> 04:26.059
and he had educated himself.

04:26.140 --> 04:37.295
When my interests took a different direction from his, he tried to read about the things I was interested in so he would know me better.

04:38.377 --> 04:47.069
So when I came home and said I was going to get a job after my bachelor's degree, he said, no, you're going to go back to school.

04:47.409 --> 04:48.932
He said, I don't care where you go.

04:50.133 --> 04:51.415
I don't care what you take.

04:52.778 --> 04:53.520
I'll pay for it.

04:54.623 --> 05:01.140
I said, all right, I'll go to Yale, study under George Pierce Baker, take two years, cost $4,000.

05:01.662 --> 05:03.246
This was at the end of the Depression.

05:04.248 --> 05:07.918
He said, all right, I'll borrow the money and send you.

05:07.898 --> 05:13.990
I said, if you're going to be that big a damn fool, I'll go where you can afford to send me.

05:15.613 --> 05:26.515
We visited a number of schools and universities in the Midwest, and I ended up at the State University of Iowa that had a good theater arts department.

05:26.495 --> 05:35.990
I graduated in February of 1942.

05:37.833 --> 05:43.302
During, of course, the previous December, Pearl Harbor happened.

05:45.405 --> 05:52.857
My roommate and I tried to enlist in the V-12 Navy program.

05:54.085 --> 05:57.710
I was denied because of my eyesight and allergies.

05:58.351 --> 06:02.156
He was denied because he was 6'6", which was unusual in those days.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.959
There weren't many people who were 6'6".

06:06.702 --> 06:08.103
Both of us were later drafted.

06:10.567 --> 06:13.090
We couldn't get in, but we were drafted.

06:15.027 --> 06:19.513
After I graduated, I came home and taught one semester.

06:20.153 --> 06:24.219
I taught theater arts in the Edwardville High School.

06:26.081 --> 06:29.405
That summer I was drafted.

06:31.227 --> 06:38.757
The draft board doctor whom I knew personally said, they'll draft you after women and children.

06:39.327 --> 06:46.380
And then one day walking down the street from across the street, he waved at me and said, hey, Pierce, forget everything I ever said.

06:46.981 --> 06:48.964
And so I was drafted shortly thereafter.

06:49.625 --> 06:55.075
Spent three and a half years in the Army, 10 months overseas in England.

06:55.255 --> 06:56.678
I was about to be sent.

06:58.362 --> 07:03.088
over to France during the Battle of the Bulge during that period.

07:03.368 --> 07:07.794
And they took away my GI trousers and gave me limey trousers.

07:07.874 --> 07:11.238
They took away my GI blanket and gave me a horse blanket.

07:12.359 --> 07:17.265
And then they were going to take me and send me over as a medic.

07:17.285 --> 07:19.067
And I knew nothing about being a medic.

07:19.188 --> 07:22.532
I said, well, I'll have to carry my typewriter with me.

07:23.613 --> 07:27.778
And the week before I was to go, why the war ended in

07:27.758 --> 07:38.628
And we, our medical hospital I was in, was immediately shipped back to the States to be retrained to go to the South Pacific.

07:40.189 --> 07:47.956
And a week before we were to embark for the South Pacific, the war ended with Japan.

07:48.277 --> 07:54.282
And so all of us had too many points to be shipped over, and we were kept in the States.

07:54.382 --> 07:57.445
And I was discharged six months later.

07:59.720 --> 08:06.790
I got out of the Army about February 5, 1946.

08:07.631 --> 08:19.787
I took a couple of weeks getting home, stopped off to visit my college roommate who had been discharged earlier.

08:21.067 --> 08:24.577
And then got home on the 13th of February.

08:25.118 --> 08:26.602
On the 14th, I rested.

08:27.726 --> 08:35.447
On the morning of the 15th, I was paid $5 to proctor a Pepsi-Cola scholarship.

08:36.592 --> 08:46.104
I got home at noon and there was a notice from the University of Illinois that there was a job at Texas A&M.

08:46.344 --> 08:59.680
I had written a month before I was discharged to Dr. Williams in the placement office at Illinois, whom I knew personally, being a friend of his son's, and I had written him get me a job at some college or university.

08:59.660 --> 09:09.131
So I have this notice at noon, and it said the job started on the 18th, and this was the 15th.

09:11.037 --> 09:11.779
And so...

09:13.666 --> 09:18.974
I said, well, I better send them a special delivery air mail letter telling them I'm interested.

09:19.695 --> 09:21.577
And my father said, why don't you wire?

09:22.659 --> 09:27.406
And my mother, who was a common sense member of the family, said, why don't you phone?

09:28.828 --> 09:32.974
So I phoned Dr. Thomas F. Mayo, who was the head of the department.

09:34.135 --> 09:44.108
He said that he was very interested in what I told him, and as soon as he got my resume from the University of Illinois, he would let me know.

09:44.229 --> 09:55.063
Well, he got it that afternoon, and the next morning I had a telegram offering me a job for nine months at $225 a month.

09:56.613 --> 09:58.596
Beginning right then.

09:58.616 --> 09:59.837
And as an instructor.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.965
And so I flew down on a Sunday.

10:05.726 --> 10:11.734
I got into Houston and it started raining.

10:13.096 --> 10:16.961
I took a bus up to College Station.

10:17.382 --> 10:21.928
On the way up, I saw a young man across the aisle.

10:21.908 --> 10:28.380
He was reading a math book, and I said, would you mind telling me if you go to A&M?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.362
He said, yes, I do.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.448
I said, would you mind telling me something about A&M?

10:32.468 --> 10:33.971
I know nothing about it.

10:34.652 --> 10:38.660
He said, it's the best damn men's military college in the nation.

10:39.742 --> 10:41.385
That was my introduction.

10:41.365 --> 10:47.617
That was the last thing I wanted to see after three and a half years in the Army was more men in uniform.

10:47.717 --> 10:55.392
My vision of teaching was a young girl on the front row with her legs crossed.

10:56.232 --> 10:58.155
And that was denied.

10:58.475 --> 11:03.102
When I got to A&M, the blackout was still in effect from the war.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.105
Campus was raining.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.108
It was pitch black.

11:07.128 --> 11:10.393
I stepped off at the bus station, which looked like a four-holder privy.

11:11.014 --> 11:12.796
And it was over Eastgate then?

11:12.816 --> 11:13.417
Yeah.

11:13.437 --> 11:15.961
And it was—no, it was Northgate.

11:16.201 --> 11:16.702
Oh, Northgate.

11:16.722 --> 11:17.283
Northgate.

11:17.303 --> 11:24.754
It was probably where Kinko's, in that area, was.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.881
It was just a shack and you stepped off into mud.

11:28.542 --> 11:33.653
They had this twisted green wire with a dirty bulb on the end of it and that was the lighting.

11:35.196 --> 11:40.988
I took one look and I was about to step back on the bus and leave when they pulled out.

11:40.968 --> 11:50.284
I called Dr. Mayo and he said, I have a room for you at Aggieland Inn.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.731
The fellow at the bus station said he drove a taxi.

11:53.751 --> 11:56.375
I said, can you drive me to the Aggieland Inn?

11:56.636 --> 11:57.998
He said, yes.

11:57.978 --> 12:02.324
And about two blocks I was at the Aggieland Inn.

12:03.426 --> 12:07.231
And the next day I— Describe it in those days.

12:07.311 --> 12:08.913
I don't have a good description.

12:09.134 --> 12:18.687
Aggieland Inn, it was a very attractive sort of brick building with

12:20.084 --> 12:22.695
sort of a Spanish influence to it.

12:23.277 --> 12:28.680
And one segment was glassed for eating, dining.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.246
They had a coffee shop.

12:30.682 --> 12:32.064
about how many guest rooms?

12:33.266 --> 12:43.680
Well, there was, I think, three or four floors, I would say, probably about, just a rough estimate, about 30 or 40 at the most.

12:43.700 --> 12:48.166
And it was west of the Northgate?

12:48.787 --> 12:50.569
It was across from Cebiza.

12:50.589 --> 12:51.610
Across from Cebiza.

12:51.971 --> 12:57.178
And there was a hospital, a nurse's unit behind it.

12:57.158 --> 13:05.374
or to one side, and then there was the President's Home, that huge clapboard structure.

13:07.479 --> 13:10.445
And Spies Hall was right across from it.

13:10.865 --> 13:14.172
And what belongings did you bring on that plane trip?

13:14.557 --> 13:21.004
Well, I had the Gladstone bag, which I had gotten when I graduated from high school.

13:21.645 --> 13:27.371
My brother got a Gladstone bag when he graduated, and four years later, I got a Gladstone bag when I graduated.

13:28.192 --> 13:29.313
And so that's what I had.

13:29.433 --> 13:33.398
And I had a covert cloth suit.

13:33.418 --> 13:42.488
And when I got out the next day wearing my covert cloth suit, it was February the 18th, and it was pouring down rain again.

13:42.548 --> 13:44.530
The water was level with the gutters.

13:45.404 --> 13:55.375
And I was wearing my Army raincoat, and I was sweating more from the covert cloth suit and the raincoat than I got wet from the rain.

13:55.795 --> 14:02.462
And I walked over to the academic building where the English department was on the third floor.

14:04.164 --> 14:07.868
And Dr. Mayall greeted me and said, do you see the corner of the desk here?

14:07.888 --> 14:08.849
I said, yes, sir.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.373
He said, that's your desk.

14:12.353 --> 14:15.077
He said, we don't have office space for you at the moment.

14:15.097 --> 14:21.605
He said, you are Mr. X. Mr. Y and Mr. Z are yet to come.

14:22.967 --> 14:28.755
This was the third week, the beginning of the third week of the semester.

14:28.775 --> 14:33.501
During that telephone conversation with him before he hired you,

14:33.481 --> 14:38.407
Did he ask you any, as you recall, did he ask you any questions?

14:39.268 --> 14:40.449
No, not really.

14:40.549 --> 14:49.660
I told him I had a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois and a master's degree from the State University of Iowa, or from the University of Iowa.

14:50.821 --> 14:58.510
And we had, I think, two people who had graduated from Iowa.

14:58.490 --> 15:08.302
and before him, before the war, a fellow by the name of Bill Owens, who was a very fine writer.

15:10.004 --> 15:23.181
And he came back to A&M for a semester or a year after the war, a little later than I did, but I was Mr. X. How did you learn what your duties would be?

15:24.038 --> 15:27.384
what you would be teaching and so forth.

15:27.404 --> 15:28.746
I learned that very quickly.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.170
He said, here is your schedule.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.334
You have 15 hours of class.

15:34.115 --> 15:44.252
You have three sections of first semester freshman English and two sections of second semester freshman English.

15:44.292 --> 15:46.315
You have 135 students.

15:48.038 --> 15:49.641
Your next

15:51.511 --> 15:58.305
Your colleagues have been taking your classes for two weeks, and they will give you all the help that you will need.

15:58.365 --> 16:09.688
And he said, now, Dr. Greer has been teaching your first class, and if you'll go down the hall, and he gave me the office number, he'll help you.

16:10.765 --> 16:21.948
I went down in the hall to Dr. Greer, a very dear war man, who said, I need to take my medicine.

16:22.449 --> 16:26.277
I had my heart stopped a while back.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.905
Dr. Greer said, I'm glad to see you.

16:31.522 --> 16:34.906
Here are two sets of ungraded papers for you to grade.

16:34.926 --> 16:42.336
Your next class is 10 minutes from now in the electrical engineering building."

16:43.677 --> 16:44.859
And he told me where that was.

16:45.059 --> 16:48.263
And he said, you'll just have time to make it.

16:49.625 --> 16:53.210
And that was the kind of help I got.

16:54.812 --> 17:01.360
I went over to class and saw it was largely composed of veterans.

17:03.112 --> 17:11.447
A&M had experienced a tremendous increase that semester from veterans under the GI Bill.

17:12.389 --> 17:20.344
A lot of them had been former students who had flunked out and who had returned and were readmitted.

17:22.062 --> 17:29.916
And many of them ended up being A and B students because they had gained what they needed, which was maturity.

17:30.597 --> 17:39.152
Some of them are married, had families, and they had a responsibility and a need for education, and they buckled down and worked.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.159
And so I said to the class, I said, well,

17:45.620 --> 17:52.692
I'm two weeks behind you, so you're going to have to educate me and tell me what you've been doing.

17:52.732 --> 17:58.643
Hopefully, I will catch up with you by the time the semester is over."

17:59.764 --> 18:07.037
But I ended up that day with 270 ungraded papers.

18:07.017 --> 18:16.196
And five sections of class to teach, two preparations, and English was a minor.

18:16.797 --> 18:24.432
And all my English was in literature and in writing, creative writing.

18:24.593 --> 18:28.300
So I knew absolutely nothing.

18:28.280 --> 18:34.571
I wrote well because I had read well growing up.

18:34.591 --> 18:42.525
My mother had a talent for writing letters, usually poison pen letters.

18:44.176 --> 18:49.791
And I was usually the object of her poison pen.

18:50.212 --> 18:56.690
But she had a talent for writing and for description things, so I inherited from her.

18:57.412 --> 18:59.417
And across the street was this woman.

18:59.397 --> 19:03.381
who had been a high school English teacher.

19:04.061 --> 19:11.928
And so she read to the children of the neighborhood every afternoon of summer in this wonderful, big, dramatic voice.

19:12.929 --> 19:16.352
And she was like a second mother to me.

19:16.432 --> 19:26.041
And so she would take me down to the library with her children and make me check out eight books at first.

19:26.061 --> 19:29.404
And then after that, she didn't have to make me because

19:29.384 --> 19:39.557
I grew to love literature, and my parents always gave me what I needed and most of what I wanted.

19:39.597 --> 19:46.526
And so I had a great, great many books bought for me that I liked over the years.

19:46.546 --> 19:53.895
They spent a fortune on me in the things that I, my interest.

19:53.915 --> 19:57.720
And as long as they saw I was interested why they supported that.

19:58.983 --> 20:06.876
So my interest in English was mostly in reading.

20:07.617 --> 20:12.526
And so having read well for a great many years, I wrote well.

20:13.167 --> 20:15.150
And I'd always been interested in writing.

20:16.853 --> 20:22.442
And I'd written stories and written for Quill and Inkhorn in junior high school and so on.

20:24.295 --> 20:29.462
So I never really learned punctuation, spelling, grammar.

20:30.844 --> 20:34.209
So I wrote well, but I didn't know the things I needed to teach.

20:35.230 --> 20:42.881
And so I asked around and found out who was the best teacher of the basics of English.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.367
And fortunately, he was in the next office to mine.

20:48.815 --> 20:55.244
And I wore a path between his office and mine.

20:55.344 --> 20:56.787
And he was an excellent teacher.

20:56.807 --> 20:57.848
His name was Fred Eckfeldt.

20:59.130 --> 21:00.312
He was from Iowa.

21:00.432 --> 21:02.355
That's E-K-F-E-L-T.

21:02.775 --> 21:03.837
E-K-F-E-L-T.

21:05.119 --> 21:10.907
And he was really a very brilliant man, one of the few doctors in the department.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.066
About how many were in the faculty in English when you arrived?

21:14.086 --> 21:21.702
Well, I was number 26, Mr. X, 27 and 28 were yet to come.

21:22.684 --> 21:23.986
They arrived a week later.

21:24.487 --> 21:26.652
And this was really English and speech?

21:26.993 --> 21:29.638
This was an umbrella department.

21:31.188 --> 21:48.993
Dr. Summey, who was retired but still there, and Dr. Mayo, I think between them had decided that whatever the other departments in the college did not teach, English would teach.

21:50.255 --> 21:52.318
And so we ended up with

21:53.682 --> 21:56.105
everything in an umbrella.

21:56.125 --> 22:01.473
And so you learned over the years to teach a great variety of things.

22:02.955 --> 22:07.361
One time we had two sections in English.

22:08.122 --> 22:11.947
One was you went two hours and got one hour credit.

22:11.967 --> 22:14.130
One you went three hours and got two hours credit.

22:14.831 --> 22:21.580
We had a course in playwriting, radio writing, which was taught originally by Harry Kidd.

22:22.167 --> 22:25.651
We had oral interpretation.

22:27.332 --> 22:34.940
And we had a course in creative writing that was taught by John Paul Abbott.

22:35.140 --> 22:39.685
And we had later folklore and dramatic arts.

22:41.867 --> 22:46.773
And we taught logic because there was no logic taught on the campus.

22:47.333 --> 22:51.077
When I left years later, there were four different logic

22:52.357 --> 22:54.099
Of course, it taught over the university.

22:55.340 --> 22:59.365
Most of the people were illogical, I discovered.

23:00.946 --> 23:07.934
Actually, we taught a great many things, and a lot of these have broken off into separate departments.

23:10.076 --> 23:17.745
As you are getting settled that spring semester of 46, where did you end up finding a place to live?

23:18.185 --> 23:19.967
I lived in the YMCA.

23:20.909 --> 23:36.343
The top floor of the YMCA consisted of a series of about eight or ten rooms, some of them single, some of them holding four people.

23:37.744 --> 23:49.735
And I lived at the Y until September of 1947 when I got married.

23:49.855 --> 23:50.916
And ate at Cebesa.

23:51.402 --> 24:04.053
And I ate at either the Aggieland Inn or Cebisa or we went into town to Hotar's in downtown Bryan or places like that.

24:04.194 --> 24:12.761
But then there were Pop Wiley's and a number of other places where you could eat.

24:12.781 --> 24:14.743
And some of the drugstores served food.

24:14.943 --> 24:15.183
All right.

24:15.304 --> 24:17.946
And did you have a private room in Hawaii?

24:18.466 --> 24:19.908
I had a private room in Hawaii.

24:19.928 --> 24:21.409
Remember what the rent was?

24:21.389 --> 24:40.410
You know, I was very, very, very modest because— It was entirely furnished, including linens and— Well, yeah, it was furnished, and I don't remember whether we made our own beds or what, but being in the Army meant nothing to make my own bed.

24:41.217 --> 24:44.887
Send the laundry home to mother and the laundry bag.

24:45.268 --> 24:48.356
Actually, I had my old laundry bag.

24:48.376 --> 24:55.395
I guess I bought that home sometime and I had a black lady who did my laundry for me.

24:56.135 --> 24:56.936
every two weeks.

24:59.360 --> 25:05.250
Describe, if you please, your, you said many of these students were veterans.

25:05.851 --> 25:13.283
Describe the first year or so, the students and their zeal, their determination.

25:14.562 --> 25:21.211
Well, the first thing I learned about A&M was it was core-oriented, of course.

25:22.573 --> 25:26.718
And everybody whipped out and introduced himself.

25:28.000 --> 25:35.670
And the four teachers were walking together down the street, and they were approached by an Aggie.

25:35.710 --> 25:37.893
He would say, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy.

25:38.033 --> 25:39.996
Everybody got his own howdy.

25:39.976 --> 25:44.383
That delighted me.

25:45.545 --> 25:52.536
I remember the first time I went back to Illinois after having been some months at A&M.

25:53.137 --> 25:56.983
I went down the street saying howdy to everybody and they gave me weird looks.

25:57.003 --> 26:02.372
Who was this character?

26:04.023 --> 26:08.893
Unfortunately, we're not always the best.

26:08.973 --> 26:23.481
The regular corps members, of course, had a tremendous amount of corps business, and I put that in quotation marks, hazing, that they had to put up with.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.305
And they went to Yale practice.

26:26.332 --> 26:39.885
And I remember during one period during the first year or two when they even had yell practices that went on at 2 o'clock in the morning.

26:40.793 --> 26:43.537
And I couldn't figure out what they were unhappy about.

26:43.777 --> 26:46.461
And so I finally asked one of my students.

26:46.581 --> 26:49.746
I said, all right, I can't get a straight answer.

26:50.748 --> 26:54.253
So I'm making you president of Texas A&M.

26:54.473 --> 26:59.380
I'm saying, now what is the first thing you're going to do as president?

27:00.762 --> 27:06.210
He says, I'm going to fire the football coach and get a new coach.

27:07.355 --> 27:23.838
And that was one of my introductions to the fact that football was king at A&M and that winning football season was all important.

27:25.300 --> 27:30.428
And I went to class one day and I called the row and I said, where is this man?

27:31.950 --> 27:34.273
And he said, Mr. Pierce, he's in California.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.701
And I said, what's he doing in California?

27:37.722 --> 27:40.907
Mr. Pierce, he's the captain of the football team.

27:42.270 --> 27:45.055
So I went down the line and I called, where's this man?

27:45.876 --> 27:47.158
He's in California, I said.

27:47.319 --> 27:48.521
He football player?

27:48.541 --> 27:51.406
Mr. Pierce, he's the head of Yale leader.

27:51.426 --> 27:59.400
And after that, I got a reputation of being anti-athletic.

28:01.253 --> 28:16.478
And so when they had the little gray man, I never did learn his name, but he would actually hold the hands of one or two football players at registration and walk up to the registration desk.

28:16.498 --> 28:17.820
Who is teaching this course?

28:18.160 --> 28:18.801
Frank Pierce.

28:19.462 --> 28:20.825
We don't want him.

28:22.187 --> 28:23.228
Who else is teaching it?

28:23.469 --> 28:24.250
Nolan Shepherd.

28:24.751 --> 28:25.452
That's the one.

28:26.133 --> 28:28.577
Nolan was a Billy Lyons Phelps.

28:29.063 --> 28:34.790
of A&M, he never saw a football player he didn't like.

28:34.810 --> 28:48.928
And so I once suggested that we do away with teaching during the fall semester and just play football and then start teaching in the spring, but nobody took that suggestion to heart.

28:49.309 --> 28:53.434
In those first semesters, how did the veterans

28:53.752 --> 28:54.393
as students?

28:54.433 --> 28:58.618
How did the veterans mesh with the true freshmen?

28:58.638 --> 28:59.960
Well, everybody seemed to get along.

29:00.020 --> 29:14.157
I mean, it was a very friendly campus and it was easy to meet people at A&M and especially somewhat

29:15.318 --> 29:28.355
While it was still a relatively small school, you were thrown together with people from different departments and it was easy enough to know everybody from the president on down.

29:28.375 --> 29:31.178
Who were some of your first true friends?

29:32.400 --> 29:36.686
Well, one was another bachelor by the name of Lloyd Keel.

29:39.149 --> 29:43.975
And at that time, there was very little to do in the community and so it was

29:45.372 --> 29:54.493
The accepted thing for bachelors especially to call on their colleagues on Sunday.

29:54.513 --> 30:02.993
And so Lloyd and I would start out about 11 o'clock in the morning and we would spend the day visiting our colleagues and drinking coffee.

30:03.968 --> 30:08.177
Of course, my kidneys were in better shape in those days than they are today.

30:08.898 --> 30:22.888
I remember one time we ended up at the Summey's, and Dr. Summey was a very short-spoken small man.

30:22.868 --> 30:36.125
And I learned, to my surprise, that he was the authority on American punctuation, which is what he did his work on at Columbia University.

30:36.846 --> 30:43.034
And his dissertation was the Bible as far as American punctuation was concerned.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.859
And just one story about him quickly.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.343
And we're glad to have all the stories.

30:49.463 --> 30:51.205
One story about him quickly.

30:51.185 --> 31:09.166
I discovered that when you have a series like red, white, and blue, and you put a comma after the red and after the white before the and, that you could omit the comma before the and.

31:09.286 --> 31:14.712
And so I was writing a story, and so I went and saw Dr. Summey in the hall.
