00:03.035 --> 00:25.465
All-Face Chapel was the scene of some services, but I do not recall that there was a great deal of church activity, at least I didn't participate in it, that on the weekends, because there was nothing to do here, that many people, most of the people, if they had transportation, left.

00:26.187 --> 00:40.399
And I think if you would check of Aggies that graduated in the, let's say from 60 to 75, that 15-year era, and it's going to be 95% will be male because of going co-ed in there, there will be some female.

00:41.622 --> 00:44.027
But those that married during that period of time,

00:45.543 --> 00:51.349
Probably married a girl from Sam Houston or Texas Women's University, which is now called something else.

00:52.230 --> 00:54.152
What was our sister school back then?

00:54.592 --> 00:58.977
Because there really wasn't much to do around here.

00:58.997 --> 01:03.882
I mean, it was, you might be dead for a week before you realized you were dead.

01:03.922 --> 01:04.843
It was so boring.

01:07.445 --> 01:11.409
Was Religious Emphasis Week still going when you were an undergraduate?

01:11.429 --> 01:11.650
Yes.

01:12.611 --> 01:14.993
Do you remember, can you describe it?

01:15.142 --> 01:18.747
I'm really not in a position to give any information on that.

01:18.947 --> 01:28.320
I do recall something about A&M that when I was a freshman, in our outfit, we had two people who were Jewish.

01:30.423 --> 01:42.280
And probably the fact, if you would couple this, the story I'm fixing to tell, with the story about Bernice Evans and integration, kind of shows in my mind that the

01:43.306 --> 01:57.308
I don't want to call us, describe us as being poverty students, but the socio-economic wide rush of the student body then, they were all pretty much all the same.

01:58.089 --> 02:08.826
And whether you were a Jew, a Mormon, a Catholic, that there was very wide tolerance or very little prejudice.

02:10.648 --> 02:11.710
And that...

02:12.010 --> 02:25.708
You know, I would suspect, I have no way of knowing because I haven't been on the campus much in the last few years, but probably there is a greater level of intolerance of someone else's faith, political views, this, that, or the other now, than there ever was back then.

02:26.469 --> 02:40.887
Because the fact was that this guy that was one of the two that was Jewish, and they roomed together once a week in the mess hall, the prayer before the meal was Jewish.

02:43.415 --> 02:45.777
And did that cause any?

02:45.797 --> 02:46.258
Zero.

02:47.439 --> 02:48.760
There was no ripple over it.

02:48.780 --> 02:50.722
That was as acceptable at that point.

02:51.924 --> 03:01.894
In the olden days, before your time, among the nicknames, some of the Jewish students were nicknamed Jew Boy.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.816
It wasn't a put-down at all.

03:04.696 --> 03:05.637
Did they have a nickname?

03:06.398 --> 03:07.119
Not that I knew.

03:07.199 --> 03:10.182
They were seniors when I was freshman, and believe me, that

03:10.381 --> 03:17.112
that I would not be in a position to know and far, far, far removed from being in a position to use that.

03:17.854 --> 03:18.174
All right.

03:18.194 --> 03:33.520
On this matter of diversity, describe in general, as you recall it, the student body and its diversity, both economic and ancestry and attitude.

03:35.086 --> 03:41.977
The attitude is the easiest to describe because it was a great oneness, a great sameness, a great equality among it.

03:41.997 --> 03:49.069
That there was a person here that I had known when I was in high school.

03:50.512 --> 03:54.518
He was from Mexico and came from a very wealthy family.

03:56.201 --> 04:01.650
And because he was a Mexican citizen and he was a junior or a senior when I got here as a freshman,

04:04.583 --> 04:30.017
But that I could visit with him and that if someone in the Corps, and I was a freshman, if you were a sophomore, junior, or senior, and I was visiting with Santiago, and I said, howdy, Mr. Monroe, you were compelled to come over and introduce yourself to whom I was with because I knew you.

04:31.955 --> 04:38.843
Much like in the mess hall, if you were the senior and I was a freshman, you could not have seconds of a dish until I had first.

04:38.923 --> 04:43.629
And no matter how little there was in the bowl, you only took one eighth of it as a senior.

04:44.370 --> 04:50.377
And if I was the final freshman, there was one eighth in the bowl when it got to me.

04:51.498 --> 05:01.270
So the attitude was there was a great equality because the guy was Mexican, Spanish descent, dark olive skinned, had no more bearing,

05:02.853 --> 05:10.583
on it and that I guess it was a great revelation later in life to find out that some people didn't like each other.

05:12.966 --> 05:14.528
You'd ask about the attitudes.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.731
You also ask about a couple other things.

05:17.592 --> 05:18.113
Economics.

05:18.734 --> 05:19.715
Everybody was poor.

05:19.775 --> 05:21.237
Everybody did the same thing.

05:22.619 --> 05:32.472
If there was a person here who came from a money background, I never knew it.

05:33.346 --> 05:40.332
If there was a person here that came from an impoverished background, I never knew it.

05:42.614 --> 05:45.817
That everybody here was taken at face value.

05:48.059 --> 05:53.164
If you were smart, that was good.

05:54.665 --> 05:55.566
If you made good grades.

05:57.147 --> 06:02.492
If you were athletic, that was something and you got good grades.

06:03.569 --> 06:04.750
I worked on the radio.

06:04.950 --> 06:12.578
Lots of people knew me because I was on the radio five, six, seven days a week here when there were two radio stations in town.

06:14.901 --> 06:20.947
And that... WTAW and... And it was then KORAAM at 1240.

06:21.067 --> 06:22.248
It is now KTAM.

06:23.770 --> 06:28.094
But that those were the only two radio stations here in the market in the 60s.

06:28.715 --> 06:31.838
It was before anything on the campus, no radio, no TV.

06:33.168 --> 06:41.937
We were, I mean, you will remember an answer in the affirmative if you were asked, was this pretty much living in Desolation Row?

06:41.997 --> 06:42.758
The answer is yes.

06:45.881 --> 06:56.611
Major student organizations other than the Corps, what were they?

06:58.333 --> 07:00.055
Singing cadets, band, what else?

07:00.195 --> 07:02.297
Well, of course, the band was part of the Corps.

07:02.615 --> 07:06.579
And what did you all think, you non-band members, what did you all think of the band?

07:08.301 --> 07:09.762
We thought they were all crazy as hell.

07:10.703 --> 07:20.914
That you had a certain admiration from the band, but I had no opinion of the band because the band was housed over in the area where they ate at Duncan Dining Hall.

07:21.435 --> 07:28.622
I lived my freshman year over in the area next to University Drive, so I ate at Sebesa Dining Hall.

07:29.902 --> 07:37.249
had little to no contact with them, and that you might have some classes with them.

07:39.171 --> 07:42.674
But the classes, again, were all business.

07:44.235 --> 07:47.719
A&M has never been known as a school with a great sense of humor.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.462
What sense of humor it has, it's developed since I graduated.

07:54.905 --> 07:56.567
Singing cadets.

07:56.969 --> 08:03.697
Bob Boone was the director then, director for many, many, many years.

08:07.661 --> 08:15.250
Other than things that they did at the MSC, at events there, I had little to no contact with them.

08:16.451 --> 08:21.897
The way we sang some of the standard songs and some of the ways that

08:21.995 --> 08:32.889
Bob Boone's singing cadets sang them were not very close and so that their presentations really had very little personal appeal to me.

08:33.950 --> 08:43.142
Among the student positions of authority and or leadership other than corps commander

08:43.240 --> 08:47.565
What were the most sought-after positions?

08:47.725 --> 08:48.886
President of the Student Center.

08:48.966 --> 08:51.909
I've mentioned James Ray that was the president in 1963.

08:51.929 --> 09:03.682
A vet student named Howard Head, Dr. Howard Head, who practices equines, was there in 64.

09:03.722 --> 09:12.572
Terry Odson, who I understand became an orthopedic surgeon, was the president in 65, and the man

09:13.092 --> 09:25.283
The young man that was elected to head it the year after I left, graduated, was Johnny Rogers whom I don't have any contact with him, don't have any contact with any of them actually at this point.

09:25.904 --> 09:30.508
But it was a very prestigious position.

09:30.908 --> 09:32.990
I don't think that it was an elected position.

09:33.050 --> 09:37.214
It was a position that you interviewed for and was selected by a panel.

09:38.095 --> 09:40.517
What about student body president?

09:40.818 --> 10:09.002
in those days it was it was pre-decided that the corps of cadets decided uh some of the leaders of the corps of cadets decided that they would you know who it was going to be if they decided it was going to be joe blow from kokomo then everyone you know information was said now before you come back here today you go over and vote for joe blow and generally your elections were 98 percent to two percent if they were contested at all uh

10:09.573 --> 10:12.496
Did it matter much who the student?

10:13.357 --> 10:14.278
I can't tell you one of them.

10:14.298 --> 10:19.443
I can tell you four successive MSC council presidents.

10:19.543 --> 10:20.344
Yes.

10:20.985 --> 10:22.827
Senior class president, was that?

10:23.427 --> 10:25.729
I'm clueless about who that was.

10:26.350 --> 10:31.936
Were you aware of any secret fraternities in the student body when you were here?

10:34.258 --> 10:39.023
There was a group, I think,

10:39.492 --> 11:06.327
think of people who thought they were rangers or ranger wannabes before rudders rangers were organized and that they would go out and haze each other do the things that navy seals do now but that when and i think probably my rationalization would be that rudders rangers was formed to legitimize and legalize what they were already doing de facto

11:07.252 --> 11:20.405
The freshman drill team, when you were asking about organizations, if you were on that, despite all the bad publicity from years, recent years, that in fact, and all of that did occur back then.

11:20.425 --> 11:33.377
I mean, you know, let's be candid about it that, yes, I've been physically, mentally, and verbally hazed in my life as a student at A&M, so what?

11:35.888 --> 11:40.693
To my knowledge, there were none, others, and understanding that I was with a lot of groups.

11:40.773 --> 11:42.375
I was in the Corps all four years.

11:43.617 --> 11:59.955
I worked in the student center, I was in the community, was on the radio, did publicity for the MSC, covered a lot of ground, but I wasn't zeroed in on any one particular group.

12:00.813 --> 12:02.856
and probably was on the peripheral of dozens.

12:03.637 --> 12:04.999
What about Yale leaders?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.806
Well, of course, two stand out in my mind.

12:10.707 --> 12:22.804
One was Tom Nelson that was a year ahead of us, because when I was here they formed the Marine Unit, which was over in the old area.

12:23.746 --> 12:31.055
I pretty much went anywhere I wanted to on the campus there when I got to be a junior and senior and had a public identity.

12:32.777 --> 12:40.506
And there was, of course, Ted Hopgood that I think was one of the Yale leaders.

12:41.327 --> 12:46.013
Was being a Yale leader, was that important in student prestige?

12:46.033 --> 12:46.694
Not in my world.

12:46.894 --> 12:50.158
Now, I think it was prestigious and everybody else that will

12:50.425 --> 12:52.567
offer their thoughts on it will tell you it is prestigious.

12:53.067 --> 12:59.633
But again, I lived in a world that wasn't totally on the campus, that I had lots of different things that I did.

12:59.653 --> 13:04.577
A&M was a part of it, and a major part of it, but it was not the exclusive.

13:05.919 --> 13:09.282
Describe during your undergraduate days midnight Yale practice.

13:12.484 --> 13:13.786
Somebody bought a lot of beer.

13:17.389 --> 13:18.930
Nearly everybody drank some of it.

13:20.446 --> 13:26.533
And then we went to Yale practice and hollered and hooped and hooted around, and they told gross stories.

13:28.055 --> 13:31.900
And we lost a lot of football games, so it was probably counterproductive.

13:33.562 --> 13:36.345
Were there many dates at Yale practice then?

13:39.509 --> 13:40.610
I didn't have a lot of dates.

13:42.973 --> 13:49.120
And that because there were not a lot of places for girls to stay then, and let's think back to the 60s now,

13:51.091 --> 14:09.998
If there were a student here today that probably mom and dad at home somewhere, if their daughter from SMU, Sam Houston called and said, I'm going over to College Station, I'm staying in a hotel room tonight, it's Friday night, I'm going to go to midnight Yale practice and go into the football game tomorrow, mom and dad would not think a whole lot about it.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.824
Back then, mom and dad would have thought a whole bunch about it.

14:15.026 --> 14:17.629
There were not many places for young people to stay.

14:17.669 --> 14:20.153
There were people in the community that would let

14:20.622 --> 14:24.507
young ladies that were coming for the weekend stay.

14:24.607 --> 14:37.221
In fact, my parents, because they were schoolteachers, were both teaching in Bryan at that time, and that I had a lot of friends who were my friends because my parents had a spare bedroom.

14:38.303 --> 14:46.292
Much like after all these years, not as frequent as it used to be, but I would still get calls for people that wanted a ticket to something.

14:47.673 --> 14:54.204
Describe, during your undergraduate degrees, describe going to a home football game.

14:56.548 --> 15:00.395
Well, of course, you had the march in.

15:01.617 --> 15:04.382
You sat in a place where you could not see the game.

15:05.510 --> 15:17.147
that the idea was when you went to a football game, as I perceived it back then, was not to see a football game, but to yell at the command of the Yale leaders that this would inspire the team.

15:17.207 --> 15:20.131
And again, let me point out something I said earlier.

15:20.772 --> 15:26.320
In four years here, four football seasons here, we won 10 games because we won four games my freshman year.

15:26.921 --> 15:30.245
So that means in the next three years, we won six games.

15:33.831 --> 15:34.892
Football games,

15:36.003 --> 15:43.731
were not a big deal back then because it was going to be on an average eight out of ten times a negative experience.

15:44.431 --> 15:49.436
I don't think A&M went to a bowl, well I know A&M didn't go to a bowl game the time that I was here.

15:51.438 --> 15:54.061
Don't think we ever beat the University of Texas.

15:55.762 --> 15:57.124
Don't recall who we did beat.

15:57.164 --> 16:03.630
I think maybe one time we beat Texas Tech on a running back kickoff or something.

16:04.437 --> 16:06.639
No, the Texas Special, did we win?

16:08.741 --> 16:11.063
I don't think we won that ball game, but it was in 1966.

16:11.083 --> 16:14.707
Yeah, oh, no, that's right, that's right, yeah.

16:15.388 --> 16:30.242
You know, I know that dude, McLean, who didn't, who chose not to graduate because apparently had a year of eligibility and came back and caught it, caught the ball and ran that 95, 94, 92 yards, whatever it was.

16:30.425 --> 16:34.311
Let me add an item so it'll be preserved here.

16:36.233 --> 16:39.057
Dude McLean was in my Southern History class.

16:41.260 --> 16:47.389
And when I got his term paper in that advanced class, it was extremely lengthy.

16:48.451 --> 16:50.353
It was superbly typed.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.501
Footnotes, bibliography, everything splendid.

16:56.743 --> 16:58.225
Except no paragraph.

16:58.425 --> 16:59.166
Oh, and there were...

16:59.568 --> 17:02.312
The grammar, the word choice was superb.

17:04.135 --> 17:09.543
It was much better written than any of his essay answers had been.

17:09.563 --> 17:19.178
And then when I read it, I found that no paragraph in that term paper had anything to do with any of the other paragraphs.

17:20.821 --> 17:23.044
But each of them was footnoted and so forth.

17:24.155 --> 17:29.640
I then called him in and handed him the paper and I said, help me understand this.

17:32.383 --> 17:36.607
And he grinned and he said, oh, as you can see, I didn't really write that paper.

17:38.408 --> 17:46.676
I went over to the library and picked up a big armload of books and took them over and told the typist to type.

17:46.896 --> 17:51.681
I marked various pages and told her to take the first paragraph out of every one of those pages

17:52.150 --> 18:03.645
copy it exactly, give it a footnote, because I was thinking that maybe you really didn't read these term papers, that you would just flip the pages and see how long my paper was.

18:03.786 --> 18:10.755
And he grinned, and I said, do you realize I've got to give you a failing grade on this, a zero?

18:11.356 --> 18:13.118
And he said, no, I'm not surprised.

18:13.198 --> 18:15.001
I was just hoping that you wouldn't grade it.

18:15.782 --> 18:20.368
And there was no ill will on his part, and he didn't attempt to

18:20.703 --> 18:25.348
persuade me because he was on the football team that he knew he deserved anything special.

18:27.551 --> 18:27.951
Let's see.

18:29.793 --> 18:30.915
Did you buy senior boots?

18:31.375 --> 18:33.778
Yes.

18:34.178 --> 18:37.783
Any story related to that and what boots meant to you and so forth?

18:38.503 --> 18:42.087
My boots meant to me that I was going to be in terrible pain that day.

18:43.869 --> 18:48.154
That senior boots back then probably cost close to $100.

18:48.315 --> 18:50.457
I understand now they're $400 or $500.

18:51.652 --> 19:06.225
and they were passed down, you found somebody that was your size and you could go to the academic building then and they had places where you could take three by five cards and you could write for sale such and such or want to buy such and such.

19:07.246 --> 19:11.069
And that was how senior boots was kind of the boot exchange place.

19:12.410 --> 19:21.338
And I bought a pair of boots and I can't recall whether they were too narrow or what, but they were very uncomfortable.

19:22.735 --> 19:32.888
And I probably wore the boots two times other than when you were absolutely, positively required to wear them.

19:33.729 --> 19:46.465
That understanding all this, that again being in the 90th Division and being in the ROTC at Texas A&M,

19:47.575 --> 20:01.855
working on the radio, going to school, having some other jobs, that I was underwhelmed by a lot of the outward signs or things that people did at A&M.

20:03.097 --> 20:14.393
I know it won't show up on the tape or in a transcript, but I have small hands, as you can see, that after I got the senior ring, then all of a sudden the senior ring would make indentations.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.397
Wearing it on my ring finger would leave indentations

20:18.035 --> 20:21.361
on my little finger and my middle finger.

20:22.462 --> 20:23.765
And I never wore my senior ring.

20:24.886 --> 20:30.195
More than just enough to meet the requirements of everybody knew that I had one.

20:31.217 --> 20:39.030
And that my senior ring today is probably in as close to pristine condition as anybody from the class of 65 would have one.

20:39.871 --> 20:50.367
and the boots didn't fit, that because I did a lot of things that frequently, I can't recall that I had permission, I'm not sure that I did or didn't, but that I wore civilian clothes.

20:51.148 --> 21:06.452
As a member of the Corps of Cadets, we'd go to class in civilian clothes, and that being a day student, that I was the, I think the executive officer of my day company, and that when I was on campus,

21:07.192 --> 21:14.639
quite often that I went to lunch and marched with corps staff as the only first lieutenant.

21:15.159 --> 21:17.741
Everybody else was a major lieutenant colonel.

21:17.761 --> 21:20.884
You know, everybody else had a diamond on and I had a button, a circle.

21:21.725 --> 21:23.226
But that I would go in and eat there.

21:23.447 --> 21:26.269
And I'm sure if the university reads this, they'll send me a bill.

21:27.150 --> 21:35.157
But that I eat on campus quite frequently with the corps cadet just by marching with corps staff or if I had a friend in some outfit, I might be the only ROT Army

21:35.643 --> 21:40.008
ROTC person marching with an Air Force unit and go in and eat.

21:40.548 --> 21:43.952
But I didn't obey all the rules all the time.

21:43.972 --> 21:46.935
Now, let's see.

21:47.836 --> 21:50.359
You were not commissioned?

21:50.379 --> 21:51.560
No.

21:53.242 --> 21:56.605
Back in those days, when I enlisted, you had an eight-year commitment.

21:57.687 --> 21:59.068
But the time you were in school,

21:59.268 --> 22:00.209
counted against that.

22:00.569 --> 22:05.295
But I mean, you were not commissioned as a part of the Corps Commission.

22:07.297 --> 22:08.098
Clarify that for me.

22:08.418 --> 22:11.562
I did not go, when I graduated, I did not graduate with a commission.

22:11.622 --> 22:12.623
That's what I was meaning.

22:13.083 --> 22:13.264
Okay.

22:13.284 --> 22:17.368
But I was an enlisted man and that it started with an eight-year commitment while you were going to school.

22:17.849 --> 22:22.474
I was doing that because I knew that if you went in as a second lieutenant,

22:23.247 --> 22:31.317
With four years' experience, you made this much more money than you did as a second lieutenant with no years of experience, no experience.

22:31.337 --> 22:43.152
And so there were three of us that had done that, a guy named Frank Muller, a guy named Jerome Retrick, because all three of us were in this same unit with the 90th Division.

22:44.013 --> 22:48.779
All three of us aspired to be career military people at one time or another.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.123
I think Frank got out as a captain, and Jerome may have made majors.

22:53.656 --> 22:57.941
But nobody, to my knowledge, finished, did a 20-year career.

22:58.282 --> 23:02.967
Did you go through commissioning exercises as a participant at all?

23:03.288 --> 23:03.448
No.

23:04.469 --> 23:04.569
Okay.

23:04.589 --> 23:06.452
All right, what about commencement?

23:06.652 --> 23:09.095
Where was commencement and what was that like?

23:09.495 --> 23:10.837
Well, I don't know.

23:12.139 --> 23:19.748
Because in the great scheme of things, as I was going through,

23:21.044 --> 23:30.620
the ROTC program, and I cannot remember who my advisor was, but somewhere in there that it missed a step.

23:32.002 --> 23:44.082
And I was three hours short of being able to graduate in whatever graduation was in 1965 and had to do three hours more of work.

23:44.838 --> 23:51.965
So I did not graduate in the spring, but was a summer graduate, which that graduation was held in August.

23:52.326 --> 23:54.588
But I had already done the classwork.

23:54.608 --> 24:02.316
In fact, I think, and I can't even recall what the course was, but I had to take, I needed three more hours that somebody had missed something.

24:04.858 --> 24:06.540
And I went in and said, I need to do this.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.821
That's all I need to graduate.

24:08.902 --> 24:13.427
And some person of great benevolence said, if you'll do this, this, and this, you're free to go.

24:14.977 --> 24:24.433
And that by July of 1965, I was living in Madrid, Spain, working for an international company.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.477
So you didn't come back for commencement?

24:26.717 --> 24:28.440
No.

24:30.483 --> 24:30.944
Let's see.

24:33.248 --> 24:36.073
What were some of the off-campus events

24:37.572 --> 24:46.800
in anywhere in the world that you remember that struck you as being serious?

24:47.961 --> 24:48.842
Oh, none then.

24:49.202 --> 24:51.704
Well, the assassination of it.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.325
Oh, all right.

24:52.505 --> 24:54.126
Oh, anything back during the 60s.

24:54.146 --> 24:54.507
Yeah.

24:54.567 --> 24:55.588
Where did you hear it?

24:56.348 --> 24:58.650
Where did you hear the news and what did you think about it?

24:58.950 --> 25:03.074
I was in the student center because they had TVs in the student center.

25:03.094 --> 25:06.617
It was really the only place on campus and they only had two or three.

25:07.694 --> 25:10.898
that you could get any kind of outside world information.

25:10.918 --> 25:12.320
The battalion certainly didn't print it.

25:14.203 --> 25:26.358
Working at the local radio stations, I did have access to teletypes and network news for ABC during part of the time when I worked for the old KORA.

25:29.983 --> 25:35.170
I recall one of the courses that I took as a sophomore

25:37.090 --> 25:38.432
that was a government class.

25:38.492 --> 25:45.681
I can't remember the professor, but he gave a quiz each week on current events because he recognized the importance of knowing what was going on.

25:46.001 --> 25:46.762
Blue Book Benton?

25:47.363 --> 25:56.314
No, I've had him a couple of times, but this was a relatively young guy and I don't think he's had a long career at A&M.

25:56.755 --> 26:03.503
But I took the course and that he had made some

26:05.018 --> 26:29.828
wager, bet, challenge to the class saying if you can answer these 10 questions about current events you don't have to do any papers or you don't have to do any take the final or something and I said I'll take the challenge and he asked me 10 questions and I answered them all or six questions or three questions but I knew about current events because back then in broadcasting

26:30.331 --> 26:32.574
We had for news what you called rip and read.

26:33.215 --> 26:36.539
You went out one minute before the newscast.

26:36.559 --> 26:38.041
You ripped it off the teletype.

26:38.262 --> 26:40.284
You walked in there and you read it.

26:40.825 --> 26:43.589
And if there were typos in it, you fabricated the news.

26:45.411 --> 26:49.296
But that I, you know, I've been a news junkie since high school.

26:50.618 --> 26:52.000
And I made an A in that course.

26:52.561 --> 26:55.204
And it was at 9 o'clock, Monday, Wednesdays, Fridays.

26:55.224 --> 26:55.645
Remember that?

26:56.045 --> 26:57.267
Second floor, Nagel Hall.

26:59.322 --> 27:01.164
But back to the Kennedy assassination.

27:03.708 --> 27:08.454
Everybody was in shock that we just kind of wandered aimlessly around the campus.

27:08.935 --> 27:11.438
People did not speak, did not say howdy to each other.

27:11.458 --> 27:12.519
No one wore their hats.

27:14.482 --> 27:18.908
It was a time that young people did not know how to grieve.

27:20.309 --> 27:23.153
Most of us at that point in our life had not been touched by death.

27:24.235 --> 27:26.157
And this was the commander in chief.

27:27.048 --> 27:30.273
Dumbfounded, struck dumb.

27:31.695 --> 27:34.880
I can't think of adjectives that would adequately describe.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.781
We didn't know what to do.

27:36.602 --> 27:36.822
All right.

27:36.842 --> 27:41.269
Now, I personally was struck, sadly also, that it had happened in my state.

27:43.452 --> 27:44.193
I was embarrassed.

27:45.115 --> 27:46.357
I didn't have those feelings.

27:46.617 --> 27:47.658
It could have happened in St.

27:47.678 --> 27:48.039
Louis.

27:48.079 --> 27:49.902
It could have happened in Seattle.

27:51.765 --> 27:54.969
That the where it happened meant nothing.

27:55.290 --> 27:56.852
That it had happened meant everything.

27:57.980 --> 28:08.137
All right, as you look back on those years, who were some people that you realized touched your life, some faculty, staff, advisors?

28:11.482 --> 28:24.223
Wayne Stark, of course, was probably the single most influential person during my college years on my life because I had such a diversity of things that I did.

28:25.351 --> 28:32.262
one of the people that I worked for in broadcasting had a great impact.

28:32.283 --> 28:38.513
In fact, it's why I stayed in broadcasting because of the quality of this man as a human being, as a Christian.

28:39.174 --> 28:42.059
He was not a very good broadcaster, but he was a wonderful human being.

28:47.548 --> 28:50.633
In truth, the academic portion of it

28:53.313 --> 29:00.261
I did it out of it's an obligation of things you do, much like I shave each morning and comb my hair and brush my teeth.

29:02.384 --> 29:10.153
The extracurricular activities was where I discovered about the Aggies.

29:10.333 --> 29:22.948
If you know an Aggie, and for an example, that when I went to Madrid, I was in a four-man department

29:23.350 --> 29:24.531
a Spanish national.

29:25.112 --> 29:31.718
They brought over a man from England, and the head of the unit was an Aggie class of 48 named Tom Knox.

29:33.059 --> 29:42.388
Probably only saw him five times, but that I always knew that he was there if something came up.

29:45.391 --> 29:51.197
And I learned because of Wayne Stark, who introduced to people that

29:51.768 --> 30:12.217
You know, it's not necessary that you know the king, but if you know someone who knows the king, how important that is and how applicable that is as a life, an adult life, a real life afterwards.

30:12.237 --> 30:14.019
How did you get that job?

30:14.039 --> 30:16.763
Did A&M have an effect on your getting that job?

30:18.143 --> 30:19.765
Let's don't go in that direction.

30:20.086 --> 30:24.492
Let's go back and I'd like to talk some more about student life.

30:24.712 --> 30:26.374
Oh, oh, oh, splendid.

30:28.177 --> 30:41.755
Back then, one of the things that you could do as a student was that you could take as little or as much responsibility as you wanted to.

30:41.815 --> 30:45.400
And a lot of people used the Corps of Cadets as a vehicle

30:46.477 --> 31:03.904
for going up there, and I'd like to use Ted Hopgood as an example because Ted was an outstanding student then, not in terms of academics, they have no idea where he was academically, but that he was a leader of men then.

31:03.964 --> 31:13.378
And he devoted his into the Marines and to being a leader in the Corps of Cadets.
