WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:06.068
It was just a department of business then, wasn't 
it? It was agricultural economics. And they were

00:08.913 --> 00:15.704
in the building toward the system building from 
Cushing.

00:18.288 --> 00:18.689
I don't remember. I really don't. I'm sorry. Was Ty 
Timm there in Ag Econ yet? Tyris Tim. Yeah, I don't

00:27.413 --> 00:29.155
remember. I don't think so. I never heard the name. 
As you look back now, what were some of the most

00:32.840 --> 00:38.208
important courses that you took? Well, 
statistics, business cycles, accounting, of

00:39.229 --> 00:46.298
course. Do you remember who taught that? No, I 
don't. And about the typical business class had

00:50.504 --> 00:54.173
how many students in it? Well, not too many. That's 
what I liked. You know, maybe 20, 30. And if you

00:58.924 --> 01:07.264
needed to see a teacher, one of your instructors, 
were they hard to locate? You know, I don't

01:07.885 --> 01:09.768
remember having to. So I can't really answer it. 
But I think they used to hang around a while and

01:11.972 --> 01:16.820
talk, unless they had another class or something. 
I never saw them being aloof or not wanting to talk

01:18.082 --> 01:22.350
to somebody. They all seemed real, real nice. Do 
you remember any easy pushover courses? My

01:27.865 --> 01:30.007
freshman year, you know, Spanish. I spoke Spanish 
better than the professor did. Math was real easy

01:35.694 --> 01:37.435
then. My whole freshman year was kind of a 
pushover. In fact, had you been well prepared at El

01:40.559 --> 01:43.302
Paso High? For all these things, I was, yes. Yes, I 
sure was. And your problem in chemistry was you

01:47.486 --> 01:50.189
hadn't taken chemistry. I hadn't prepared myself 
for engineering. I said, I want to be an engineer.

01:55.186 --> 01:58.033
My parents were immigrants, and they didn't know 
how to prepare me. They didn't ask me about the

01:58.354 --> 01:59.858
future. They didn't ask me what I wanted to do. They 
just wanted me to go to college. I thought, you just

02:02.846 --> 02:06.495
went to college, you know?

02:08.045 --> 02:10.227
Of course, as I look back, I wouldn't have changed a 
thing. I'm really happy with my life, you know. I'm

02:14.212 --> 02:18.036
happy, extra happy with my experience at A&M. I 
think it matured me, you know, and I needed that.

02:20.499 --> 02:25.084
Really bad for...

02:26.406 --> 02:33.073
The easy courses, there weren't any special 
courses for athletes or rich kids or anything like

02:26.406 --> 02:33.073
that, were there? Not that I'm aware of. I've never 
heard of it. I know there was a special table for

02:36.459 --> 02:38.604
athletes. They had better, well I can't say better 
food. Maybe they had more food than we did, because

02:41.912 --> 02:45.641
the food was good. Were there any, in your years 
there, were there any celebrity students? That

02:53.540 --> 02:59.387
is, students that were famous because of their 
parents being rich or they were great athletes?

02:59.467 --> 03:01.509
No, no, never. Well, you know, some of the football 
players we admired, but they didn't. Who were some

03:06.515 --> 03:07.416
of those? Oh, gosh, let's see. What was his name? I 
thought he was so good-looking, man. He was

03:14.224 --> 03:19.370
really handsome. He was... I guess one of his 
relatives was a senator or a congressman or

03:21.974 --> 03:26.779
something. What was his name? Not Zabriskie, that 
was a coach.

03:33.626 --> 03:35.047
Oh, gosh. Well, besides my cousin Art, you know. 
Did any famous people come to visit the campus? Bob

03:40.673 --> 03:42.675
Hope came once. Really? Yeah. Did you see him? Oh, 
yeah. We sat next to him at, what was the name of that

03:45.037 --> 03:49.241
restaurant there? It's probably still there. Not 
Hotard's, that was in Bryan. Is it still there? No,

03:56.360 --> 03:58.303
but it was there when I got there. Oh man, that was 
wonderful food for a cafeteria. And where did Bob

04:03.874 --> 04:05.497
Hope perform? In the hall. In Bryan Hall. In Bryan 
Hall? And you went to? Yeah. And then we went to eat

04:15.468 --> 04:19.835
at North Gate restaurant, and he was there eating. 
And we sat real close to him there. But, of course, I

04:21.798 --> 04:24.723
didn't ask him for his autograph or anything. I was 
still, you know.

04:29.310 --> 04:34.438
And when you and your buddies went to a movie in 
Guyon Hall, what was it like? How did Aggies behave

04:34.478 --> 04:36.141
at Guyon? Good. Did they make noise, though? No. 
Only in reaction to the movie, I think. Later,

04:46.182 --> 04:51.507
apparently, the kids would make lots of noise. 
They would shout and ha-ha and boo and so forth.

04:58.854 --> 04:59.014
Wow. I don't remember. As you got settled in, where 
did you and your buddies go to have a good time on

05:01.516 --> 05:11.445
Saturday night?

05:12.640 --> 05:14.924
Well, we used to go to the Baptist Church on 
Wednesday nights. They had a couple of people

05:16.166 --> 05:18.049
there that were real good. I used to go with a fellow 
from, I think, Harlingen, right around there.

05:25.661 --> 05:28.065
Name was Frog Nash. Big old guy. Just as sweet and 
lovable as you can imagine. We used to go together

05:34.014 --> 05:35.757
on Wednesday nights. And I used to love to go with 
him because... i can't carry a tune and my voice is

05:38.594 --> 06:06.137
terrible but it's not strong he couldn't carry a 
tune either but he had a big voice and he'd sing so i

05:38.594 --> 06:06.137
could sing right along with him because i knew 
nobody was going to hear me and it was a lot of fun

05:38.594 --> 06:06.137
saturdays what was one of the reason for y'all 
going on wednesday night did they serve food no oh

05:38.594 --> 06:06.137
this one no okay and they took a collection but it 
was just just not it was something to do really we uh

06:06.117 --> 06:08.079
Now, had you been a churchgoer at home? No. We grew 
up Orthodox, so we didn't have a church. I'm

06:13.225 --> 06:18.491
Presbyterian now, but then we didn't have a 
church. But when you were in college at A&M, did you

06:18.511 --> 06:22.296
go on Sundays? No, just Wednesday nights. What did 
you and your buddies do then on a Sunday? Well, like

06:29.324 --> 06:32.327
on a Saturday, there was a restaurant. in Bryan, 
around Bryan somewhere, called Wimpy's. And they

06:38.169 --> 06:41.694
had real steaks that were cheap. I don't know, a 
dollar or two dollars, I don't know. Real thin, and

06:44.799 --> 06:47.723
they were pan fried, but they were really good. And 
we'd go over there and have a steak, or we'd go to

06:48.424 --> 06:53.772
Hotard's and eat, go to a movie.

06:56.756 --> 07:02.044
We didn't drink a lot, so we didn't go out and drink. 
How did you get around? Did you ride the bus much? We

07:06.945 --> 07:09.308
rode the bus, yeah, to Bryan. And you always wore 
your uniforms off campus? Yes, yes. I always did,

07:16.619 --> 07:23.388
except when we turned non-reg my senior year, I 
didn't. In fact, I stayed in the Corps one year. My

07:26.593 --> 07:30.478
junior year, one semester, without a contract. I 
just stayed in the Corps. And then I went non-reg, I

07:33.917 --> 07:38.386
figured it wouldn't, you know. Back to other 
celebrity visitors other than Bob Hope. Anybody,

07:42.134 --> 07:44.239
any other famous people come? There was a preacher 
from Oklahoma that used to come. Just inspiring

07:48.059 --> 07:51.164
and I forgot it. I think it was Alexander. I'm not 
sure used to come from Oklahoma and Give sermons or

07:52.366 --> 07:58.476
perform. I don't know he gave sermons, but he just 
did him so It was entertainment. You know, it was so

08:03.485 --> 08:04.627
good. Where did he speak that guy had gone? Mm-hmm. 
Yeah Well now did any of the big orchestras come to

08:07.191 --> 08:13.341
play for the dances I Tommy Dorsey? You know, 
probably. But I only went to one dance, that was my

08:18.242 --> 08:21.226
senior ring dance. That's the only dance I went to. 
So I wasn't really aware of it.

08:29.398 --> 08:36.088
The YMCA, is that where you all went to get a soft 
drink and coffee? No, we went to Lupo's. Lupo's

08:39.384 --> 08:41.849
Trading Post, I think was the name of it, wasn't it? 
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Still there at Northgate. It is? His

08:45.916 --> 08:46.858
son's running it. Isn't that something? Where did 
you buy your books, from Lupo? I think so. Did you

08:52.649 --> 08:54.212
ever borrow any money from him? No, never did. He 
loaned money to lots of students interest-free to

08:56.656 --> 09:01.223
pay for your books. Wow. I think, I don't know 
whether I cashed checks there or some, I think I

09:02.004 --> 09:06.511
cashed checks there. And the post office was at 
Northgate? Yeah, yeah, it was close by, yeah. You

09:15.765 --> 09:19.251
didn't have any blind dates with girls from T.W. 
Tessie's? Yeah, Texas, yeah. I think my junior

09:22.796 --> 09:24.098
year. my cousin's sister fixed us up with a couple 
of girls and It was a disaster They we hadn't met him

09:25.546 --> 09:47.072
we didn't know him and I Guess they looked at us the 
way we looked at them, you know, it just didn't go

09:25.546 --> 09:47.072
and that was the only blind date ever But how were 
how were young women treated? on the A&M campus I

09:49.441 --> 09:50.383
thought real good. I mean, you know, I never heard 
anybody complain. I've never heard anything but

09:54.694 --> 09:56.398
positive. Yeah, oh yeah, real good.

10:01.531 --> 10:04.358
You didn't get sick, you didn't have to go to the 
quack shack? No, no, never did. Is that what they

10:08.020 --> 10:08.861
called it? In general, describe the student body 
when you were there. Where were they from? What

10:16.493 --> 10:17.915
kind of families? Where geographically? What 
were their attitudes?

10:23.383 --> 10:24.865
Gosh, they were from all over the state. We had a few 
from Mexico, too.

10:31.575 --> 10:31.956
I don't know. They all had really good attitudes. 
Everybody that I met did. Were they rich boys, poor

10:37.265 --> 10:38.887
boys? You never could tell. You never could tell 
whether they had money or not. Everybody was

10:44.514 --> 10:45.696
treated the same. Nobody asked if they had money. I 
couldn't tell. That's one of the common threads

10:50.342 --> 10:53.786
that goes through all these interviews. Yeah, I 
really couldn't tell. And I don't think anybody

10:54.768 --> 10:57.872
could tell about me, and I was frugal. But I don't 
think anybody ever asked me. I don't think anybody

11:01.396 --> 11:04.200
ever said I was a poor boy. No, it was real nice. Now, 
what did it take to be accepted as one of the group?

11:17.628 --> 11:18.008
I don't know. I think it just happened. Am

11:19.570 --> 11:26.318
I correct that you had to participate? Oh, yeah, 
sure, sure. But once you did that, you know, you

11:30.243 --> 11:32.365
were... It was kind of like a family. I mean, you 
know, all the outfits had cohesion, you know. They

11:39.401 --> 11:42.564
were proud of their outfit and they stuck 
together. And there were some Jewish boys and

11:42.684 --> 11:46.369
Catholic boys? Oh yeah, I had two or three. Yeah, I 
had two or three Jewish boys in my outfit.

11:53.197 --> 11:57.122
Do you remember what any of those other guys' 
nicknames were? No. Because the Maltz boys from

12:01.657 --> 12:04.019
Houston, Jewish. Oh, yeah, I knew one of them. 
Class of 51. They said their nickname was Jew Boy.

12:09.704 --> 12:10.005
Really? And I said, was it a put-down? He said, no, 
we were proud to be Jewish. That's right. No, they

12:14.308 --> 12:20.194
never, of course, all the Jewish guys in my outfit 
were above me. Mr. Holstey from Galveston, what a

12:22.216 --> 12:25.238
cutie. He was funny. He was a nice guy, too. He was an 
upperclassman. Bushman, there was one named

12:29.872 --> 12:31.854
Bushman. He was real nice, kind of, he was kind of an 
upperclassman, you know what I mean? Where Holst,

12:40.363 --> 12:47.570
he was, you know, he was an upperclassman, but he 
kind of, you know, joked around and kind of, who

12:40.363 --> 12:47.570
else? And did many Aggies have cars then? No, no, 
very few. Now, what year was it that there were so

12:55.488 --> 13:05.081
many freshmen with the veterans that they moved 
the fresh out to the old air base?

13:07.844 --> 13:09.467
That must have been after I left. Is that right? I 
think so, because I don't remember it happening.

13:12.911 --> 13:19.280
Okay, because somewhere about that time, and so 
the sophomores didn't have anybody to haze. Oh,

13:19.300 --> 13:19.820
boy. No, no, that didn't happen while I was there. I 
graduated in June of 49. I believe maybe it's that

13:25.060 --> 13:27.827
fall. Describe the religious activities on 
campus and around the campus. Well, like I said, on

13:35.245 --> 13:39.931
Wednesday nights, I used to go to the Baptist 
Wednesday night meetings. But there were a number

13:39.951 --> 13:42.375
of other congregations. Yeah, there was an 
Episcopal congregation. I went there a couple of

13:44.678 --> 13:52.528
times because when we were children, we went to the 
Episcopal Church because it was the closest in

13:44.678 --> 13:52.528
theology and everything to the Orthodox Church. 
We went there just a couple of times.

13:59.497 --> 14:02.181
And then that preacher that used to come from 
Oklahoma, uh he always drew a crowd it was was there

14:02.549 --> 14:29.130
a spring religious emphasis week then there would 
be in the 50s yeah i don't remember it unless that

14:02.549 --> 14:29.130
was what was that was when that guy from oklahoma 
came down you know that could have been um football

14:02.549 --> 14:29.130
games what about basketball games did y'all you 
and your buddies go to the games i didn't go to many

14:02.549 --> 14:29.130
we went to some baseball games We were freshmen 
because they used to make us shoot a back gun. I

14:32.384 --> 14:32.885
hated it. They made us do it, you know. At the game? 
Yeah, at the game, yeah. So I went to a few games

14:37.853 --> 14:41.859
then, but after that I didn't go to many. Who was the 
commandant of the Corps when you were there? Do you

14:44.723 --> 14:45.164
remember? General or colonel? Yeah. Was Boatner 
there yet? No. No. And, you know, Tom Parsons was

14:55.148 --> 14:59.812
the commandant there several years ago. He was in 
our class. That's what I thought. Yeah. And he was

15:03.496 --> 15:07.880
in B battery, I think, when I was in E battery or A 
battery. He was a sophomore when I was a freshman.

15:12.224 --> 15:13.405
I've interviewed him. Nice guy. Who was the 
president? Gilchrist? Yeah, we had kind of a

15:19.150 --> 15:21.953
revolution or something. They wanted to get rid of 
one of the presidents, and we all marched on his

15:25.068 --> 15:27.533
home. The guy, the upperclassmen turned in their 
sabers. I don't even remember who it was. I think it

15:36.413 --> 15:37.635
was Gilchrist. I think it was, yeah. Were you in 
that group? Yes, yeah. I marched with them, but,

15:40.822 --> 15:42.165
you know. You didn't turn in your saber. I didn't 
have one. We just were supposed to go and we went,

15:45.368 --> 15:48.773
you know, yeah. And as I understand it, he was 
pretty firm. He must have been because nothing

15:53.059 --> 15:55.122
happened, you know. Yes.

16:02.173 --> 16:03.134
Was Reveley around? Yeah, yeah. What did you and 
your buddies think of Reveley? Everybody loved

16:09.213 --> 16:12.918
her, you know, she wasn't she wasn't a pest. Oh, I 
never saw her except at football games, you know,

16:13.379 --> 16:22.292
yeah In fact, I don't know where they kept her or 
anything What did you and your buddies think

16:13.379 --> 16:22.292
about? Yale leaders and Corps commanders and We 
thought it was a nice place to be I did you know I

16:23.694 --> 16:34.630
thought they deserved it and I think they earned it 
I mean it was it was something that You respected

16:34.897 --> 16:35.840
them? Yeah, absolutely, yeah. It was something 
that you earned, something you probably worked

16:37.344 --> 16:42.279
for, and something you deserved, you know. Oh, 
yeah. As you think back, did you have a favorite

16:44.486 --> 16:47.455
Aggie yell?

16:53.948 --> 16:54.389
Saw. Saw Varsity's horns off? Saw Varsity's horns 
off.

17:00.578 --> 17:04.543
Now, you're there between World War II and the 
Korean War. So it is a period of boom. Was the area

17:08.730 --> 17:10.993
around the college growing?

17:13.617 --> 17:15.239
It might have been just beginning to. It wasn't 
boom boom yet, you know. but college view those

17:20.122 --> 17:49.656
married student apartments for the veterans was 
crowded yeah oh yeah what kind of students how what

17:20.122 --> 17:49.656
quality of students were the veterans they were a 
lot better students than they would have been out

17:20.122 --> 17:49.656
of high school they were really serious about 
their education i noticed that they had matured

17:20.122 --> 17:49.656
they had matured and they were ready you know they 
they really i got to know several of them and

17:20.122 --> 17:49.656
everything and they really Had a mission. I mean, 
they wanted an education, and they were going to

17:51.201 --> 17:55.306
get it, and they were going to learn, and they 
worked at it. All the ones I knew. Did you

17:56.889 --> 18:00.613
non-veterans think that they made it tougher for 
you all to make good grades? I didn't. I didn't. No,

18:03.938 --> 18:12.389
but, you know, they might have made us study a 
little harder just because we saw how they were

18:03.938 --> 18:12.389
doing and how they appreciated education and 
valued it. Now, there were also some veterans

18:12.950 --> 18:19.879
living in temporary housing down near Kyle Field, 
weren't there? I don't remember those.

18:26.775 --> 18:28.677
What did you and your buddies think about the band? 
Oh, we lived with the band. They were above us, you

18:32.742 --> 18:34.504
know. And we knew them as individuals, as people, 
and they were wonderful. And they worked hard. Did

18:40.110 --> 18:40.470
they? They worked hard. You know, they used to 
practice every afternoon. They gave up a lot of

18:44.775 --> 18:47.659
their time, and it showed. Did you and your buddies 
ever play tricks on them? Did the, was there in the

18:51.162 --> 18:53.545
dormitory any? No, no, I don't remember doing 
anything with them. I think when we were with B

18:57.070 --> 19:05.721
Battery, we used to have those, what did they used 
to call them when we used to flood a guy out?

19:06.402 --> 19:06.842
Drownouts. Drownouts, yeah, we had a couple of 
those, not many. But no, I don't think, I never did.

19:13.150 --> 19:16.815
Do you remember any good stories about pranks, 
Good Bull? Any tricks that you may have known

19:18.500 --> 19:21.383
about?

19:26.888 --> 19:28.849
Did you ever go down in the steam tunnels? No. 
Really? Never did. Never even knew there were

19:31.572 --> 19:32.893
steam tunnels. Nobody ever told me. Did you know 
that there were secret fraternities? No, I

19:38.618 --> 19:39.439
didn't. Were there? Were very many people aware of 
that? No. That's what I thought. Very, very few.

19:48.065 --> 19:52.771
Let's see, we did hitchhiking and dates. When you 
and your buddies went out to have a good time on

19:54.553 --> 20:03.223
Saturday night, you sometimes went out to eat, 
went to a movie. Where did people go to have a drink?

20:08.489 --> 20:09.130
You know, I don't know. I never went. I really don't 
know. Did you not drink any beer, any whiskey in

20:12.914 --> 20:17.700
those years?

20:21.713 --> 20:42.923
One time,

20:21.713 --> 20:42.923
my senior year, or was it my junior year, in the 
non-regs,

20:21.713 --> 20:42.923
I had broken up with my wife that I had met 
previously at TSCW, and she was coming down to a

20:21.713 --> 20:42.923
dance with one of her boyfriends that she knew from 
her hometown.

20:45.567 --> 20:50.674
And I wanted to sneak a peek at her, see if I could see 
her, find her, and my roommate, Ken Hone, got a

20:51.481 --> 20:55.050
bottle of wine. I don't know where he got it from. 
And I did get drunk and I never went out. I got drunk

21:00.584 --> 21:02.048
and conked out. And that was the only time I 
remember that I had a drink. Where were you when you

21:06.012 --> 21:07.554
did that drink? In my room. Oh, in your room? Yeah. 
Okay. And so it wasn't with a big crowd or anything?

21:12.000 --> 21:12.320
No, no. I never, and I don't even know whether, I 
don't think I even drank on court trips. All right.

21:17.867 --> 21:21.551
Did any of your buddies ever go to Uncle Ed's, to 
Hard Liquor's? I don't even remember. I don't even

21:23.354 --> 21:24.495
know Uncle Ed's. That was down the Welborn Road, 
directly south of Kyle Field, about a mile. Isn't

21:29.802 --> 21:31.183
that something? Then Whiskey Bridge. That was 
straight west going to Snook. You went into the

21:35.737 --> 21:38.400
next county where alcohol was legal. I must have 
run around with a lot of teetotalers because I

21:39.341 --> 21:44.407
never remember those. I mean, I didn't even know 
about those things. I wasn't aware of it. Let's

21:49.592 --> 21:49.933
see. What were Aggies smoking then? Cigarettes. 
What kind? Yeah. What brands? Mostly

21:56.900 --> 21:57.921
non-filters. I know I smoked Camels. I smoked for 
10 years. Mm-hmm. I started at A&M. You started at

22:03.947 --> 22:04.769
A&M? I started at A&M. Looking back, what 
percentage do you suspect of Aggies smoked? 60%,

22:13.224 --> 22:16.229
70% maybe. Did you know some Aggies that rolled 
their own? I never saw one. What about cigars?

22:27.533 --> 22:55.802
few pipes maybe a couple i saw yeah mostly 
cigarettes and did you all know that drugs existed

22:27.533 --> 22:55.802
had

22:27.533 --> 22:55.802
you ever heard the word marijuana or heroin i might 
have heard it but i never was aware of i don't think i

22:27.533 --> 22:55.802
heard it at a m the only time i ever heard about drugs 
was one of the drivers that used to bring stuff to my

22:56.440 --> 23:02.127
dad's store said something about marijuana one 
time. I didn't even know what it was, but I never did

23:02.147 --> 23:05.450
hear about it at A&M. I wasn't aware of drugs at all. 
I don't think it was a big thing then, but it might

23:07.593 --> 23:11.137
have been. I mean, you know, I don't know. If you 
needed advice, who did you turn to? Well, I used to

23:18.918 --> 23:22.184
go to my cousin Arthur, you know, when he was there. 
And he was real good. And then, of course, Albert

23:25.450 --> 23:30.179
Mullooly was there, too, and I'd go see him. Now, Al 
Mullooly is what year ahead of you? He was a class of

23:33.526 --> 23:34.367
45. Forty-five. Okay. All right. And I'd go see 
him. Was there an El Paso hometown club?

23:46.897 --> 23:49.040
I might have gone to a meeting once. I don't know. I 
remember the football player's name now. Monty

23:53.426 --> 23:54.308
Moncrief. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Good-looking guy. 
Yes, yes, yes. Good football player, too. Now, you

24:00.536 --> 24:02.119
came home every summer. Yes. And did you work for 
the family every summer? Except that first

24:07.386 --> 24:09.710
summer. All right. As you go back your third year, 
you didn't get a contract. No. Do you have any idea

24:15.989 --> 24:17.391
why? I think flat feet or something. Because 
during the Korean War I got called. And this was

24:23.159 --> 24:25.342
right after my wedding. I got married September 
3rd. I had to go for my physical September the 11th.

24:32.251 --> 24:37.558
So we went to New Orleans, came back for our 
honeymoon, came back to El Paso. And went and got my

24:37.910 --> 24:41.397
physical, and didn't pass that either. And I think 
it was my flat feet. That's the only thing I could

24:44.643 --> 24:45.905
think of. You know, physically I was in good shape, 
but I never... Now, where did you meet this special

24:45.945 --> 24:51.636
young lady? I met her at TSCW. Okay. She was 
Lebanese. From where? From Marshall, Texas.

24:58.509 --> 24:58.990
Marshall. And how long had her family been in the 
United States? A long time, a lot longer than we

25:03.096 --> 25:04.998
had. In fact, she didn't even speak Arabic. I mean, 
her parents spoke Arabic to keep secrets from the

25:06.800 --> 25:11.024
children. It had reached that stage. And

25:13.467 --> 25:20.795
so you meet her while you're at A&M? I met her on a 
court trip. One of my cousins introduced me.

25:27.303 --> 25:27.805
That was it. Introduced me, hi, hi, and that was it. 
I forgot about her. You know, that was all. Then we

25:32.661 --> 25:37.738
went, I had two cousins that were at TSCW. We went up 
there for a weekend four or five months later. She

25:40.938 --> 25:42.259
introduced me again. And God, this time I thought, 
gosh, she's so beautiful. She's so nice. I don't

25:46.204 --> 25:48.487
know what happened the first time that I didn't. 
When you went up there, you and your buddies, where

25:50.929 --> 25:55.955
did you all stay in Denton? We stayed in a motel. Oh, 
did you? Yeah. And a bunch of you piled into one car

25:59.179 --> 26:01.762
to go up there? Well, usually just my cousin and I 
would go. And sometimes we'd take, I think there

26:05.002 --> 26:18.586
was a fellow named Dave Goddard that was in our 
junior or senior year that was going with Abe's

26:05.002 --> 26:18.586
sister, and he'd go up with us. All right, now as 
this romance builds, how did y'all communicate?

26:22.713 --> 26:23.314
We wrote. Yeah, letters. You didn't get on the 
phone very often, I bet. No. And she still got some

26:27.749 --> 26:29.490
of the letters. Oh, good. I had a bunch. I don't know 
what happened. Oh, good, good, good. Now, pass

26:33.795 --> 26:40.061
those on to the children so they stay in the family. 
Don't let those get thrown away. And as you're

26:42.783 --> 26:52.052
looking toward graduation, what did you think you 
were going to do when you graduated from A&M? Well,

26:54.354 --> 26:55.596
I interviewed. And, you know, I was still a 
bashful, backward kind of guy, and I interviewed

26:57.518 --> 27:11.172
with J.C. Penney, I think, or Sears, one of those, 
and I just, you know, didn't know how to talk to him.

27:11.592 --> 27:14.035
And, of course, we'll let you know. Didn't even get 
a letter from him. I came home, and I said, well, I

27:17.078 --> 27:19.340
didn't know what I was going to do. I just... Didn't 
have much self-confidence and just said, well, I

27:21.530 --> 27:25.273
don't know. I came home and got a job with a truck 
line, minimum wage, keeping books. And I said,

27:36.503 --> 27:37.904
well, this isn't for me. I just can't do this all my 
life. I had my girlfriend, you know, and we were

27:41.107 --> 27:46.212
kind of getting serious. So I went to my dad and I 
says, no, I didn't. No, I was still working. for

27:51.618 --> 27:52.499
this outfit.

27:55.123 --> 27:56.946
I worked for maybe six months. And then of course, 
then we got married. My wife and I got married

28:00.471 --> 28:02.654
September 3rd. Then I had my physical. Then I 
started selling insurance. And that didn't work.

28:11.206 --> 28:15.612
It was just, it was this dollar a week insurance, 
you know, with American National. I stayed with

28:15.632 --> 28:19.077
them a year and a half or two. I said, you know, this 
just isn't for me. Joy's father had given her

28:23.442 --> 28:28.048
$5,000 as a dowry. I had $3,000 or $4,000 that I had 
saved. I bought a car with, so I didn't have any

28:31.572 --> 28:33.695
money. So I says, you know, Joy, I don't know what to 
do. She says, well, why don't we... Your dad's

28:43.046 --> 28:43.988
getting old. Why don't we buy him out and see? So we 
went to Daddy, and I says, Daddy... Why don't I take

28:50.343 --> 28:52.907
over here? He said, well, let's take inventory and 
see how much it is. Anyway, it ended up being

28:56.713 --> 28:58.676
$3,600. So we paid him and we took it over. And then 
we started from there. And then things got better.

29:06.108 --> 29:06.930
Business picked up.

29:10.475 --> 29:15.844
Let's see, we did this in, I don't know, 51 or 52. 
Business got so good, we tore the house down, built

29:16.077 --> 29:28.290
the store behind it about three times as big, then 
tore the front store down, had a nice little

29:16.077 --> 29:28.290
superette, you know, 54. And so we kept working, 
business got better, business got better,

29:29.452 --> 29:33.096
business got better. So 58, I bought the house next 
door. We tore it down, added to the store. And by the

29:40.384 --> 29:43.467
time we finished, we had a 10,000 square foot 
grocery store. We were doing about $3 million a

29:43.487 --> 29:45.409
year. And that's what we did for 30 years. Then in 
1980, we sold the store. We kept the property. We

29:55.254 --> 29:56.095
sold the store. And I sold real estate for a couple 
of years. My son had this music business that he had

30:02.145 --> 30:08.775
started from the store we had set him up in, because 
that's what he wanted to do. And he was having a hard

30:10.458 --> 30:11.920
time. by himself, and he'd done a couple of bad 
deals. He was about to go bankrupt, and I wanted to

30:16.257 --> 30:21.163
get out of the real estate business. I didn't like 
it. I said, maybe I'll go help him. So I got with him

30:23.506 --> 30:31.856
and got him straightened out, and I'm still there.

30:34.018 --> 30:39.865
We've jumped a little, but as you got into the real 
world of business, What had you learned at Texas

30:40.840 --> 30:47.488
A&M about the real world and about people that 
helped you? Everything. Everything. I

30:50.252 --> 31:00.965
remember just thinking, gosh, you know, if it 
wasn't for A&M, I wouldn't know this, or I wouldn't

30:50.252 --> 31:00.965
have done this. It just helped me a lot with my 
judgment. It helped me a lot with my risk-taking.

31:09.140 --> 31:14.933
And it helped me a lot dealing with people, you 
know, looking them in the eye, shaking hands with

31:09.140 --> 31:14.933
them firmly. You know, it transformed me. Really, 
it did.
