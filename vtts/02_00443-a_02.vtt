00:02.917 --> 00:08.585
Now, did you have any black troops assigned when 
you were in Germany or when you were in France? No.

00:09.146 --> 00:11.770
Did you have any contact at all with any of them? Not 
directly. Some of them were artillery, all right,

00:13.853 --> 00:32.721
and

00:13.853 --> 00:32.721
I'd say that in general they didn't have a very good 
reputation at the time, but most of them were

00:13.853 --> 00:32.721
quartermasters, support troops, not very many in 
the front line combat troops. Why didn't they have

00:33.308 --> 00:34.970
a good reputation? What was their reputation? 
Well,

00:38.416 --> 00:58.405
I think that in general they were considered to be 
less intelligent,

00:38.416 --> 00:58.405
less qualified, and of course the intelligence 
matter is is an uncertain thing at all, but

00:59.043 --> 01:11.515
certainly their background, their culture and 
all, they just were not up to the standard of the

00:59.043 --> 01:11.515
usual United States White troops. They hadn't had 
the same background, and they didn't have quite

01:11.615 --> 01:16.300
the same motivation. They didn't have quite the 
same level of skills. They had not participated

01:21.645 --> 01:28.071
fully in our schooling and that sort of thing in 
those days.

01:31.105 --> 01:37.154
but I certainly owe it to the United States Army for 
changing my attitude by the blacks. Where I was

01:37.174 --> 01:46.528
reared, my family and everything certainly had 
discriminated against them, considered them to

01:37.174 --> 01:46.528
be inferior. They were servants or whatever. Of 
course that was my attitude along when I grew up.

01:51.576 --> 01:56.944
And did you have servants in your household when 
you grew up? on a regular basis, but black women

01:57.160 --> 02:04.753
came to do our washing and to help out at times. Of 
course, even as poor as we were, you know, we could

02:04.833 --> 02:09.181
afford to have that kind of, yeah. How about in the 
field on your small farm? No, no, we didn't have any

02:13.388 --> 02:16.714
outside labor at all. We did all the work ourselves 
and their family. I did that. Now in my father's

02:24.560 --> 02:32.231
business, he did have some blacks who worked for 
him. Of course, they were always at the lower

02:32.251 --> 02:37.018
position.

02:39.822 --> 02:45.750
They were highly segregated, of course, in all 
aspects. So I was reared under a culture of sharp

02:47.212 --> 02:52.159
discrimination. I went to the army after they 
integrated, after I became acquainted with some

02:54.299 --> 03:08.452
fine black people and military schools and other 
ways for getting over my discrimination against

02:54.299 --> 03:08.452
blacks. Okay, now Truman desegregated the Armed 
Forces and started in 1947-48 and that was carried

03:08.472 --> 03:19.662
through into the early 1950s and the war in Korea. 
Did your reserve units then start accepting

03:20.123 --> 03:23.766
blacks? Sure did. I've had some fine black 
officers. The Army Reserves did that before the

03:32.600 --> 03:37.086
National Guard did too.

03:38.988 --> 03:44.716
We had some black soldiers in my reserve artillery 
units around.

03:47.540 --> 03:53.668
Many of them, on average, they were as good 
soldiers as I had in the white soldiers at that

03:47.540 --> 03:53.668
time.

03:56.737 --> 04:03.204
So there again, that helped me get over my 
discrimination.

04:03.224 --> 04:08.450
Was there much resistance in the reserves when 
Truman desegregated? Generally, no. In certain

04:12.115 --> 04:14.578
areas, yes. Like my organization in Arkansas 
seemed to have more difficulty in accepting them

04:15.318 --> 04:26.271
than the ones in Texas. Really? Why do you think 
that would be? Well, I think that Arkansas

04:30.523 --> 04:53.435
was still a little more rural oriented and that the 
blacks had a minor role in the rural areas of

04:30.523 --> 04:53.435
Arkansas still to a greater extent than they had in 
metropolitan areas in Texas where many of our

04:30.523 --> 04:53.435
troops were. Louisiana had more trouble, I had 
some organizations there, had more trouble

04:55.310 --> 05:02.400
integrating the blacks into the units. I think 
that's because they were a higher percentage and

05:04.103 --> 05:19.225
because in general the blacks on the average in 
Louisiana were not as well educated as the ones in

05:04.103 --> 05:19.225
Texas.

05:23.272 --> 05:30.963
So it wasn't without difficulty, but I wouldn't 
say it was a major handicap.

05:30.984 --> 05:35.490
Now let's get back to your post-war career. Why'd 
you decide to come back to Texas? You've been a man

05:39.116 --> 05:40.718
of the world now. I was on leave from Texas A&M and 
never had any other intention to come back to Texas

05:40.738 --> 05:50.072
A&M.

05:52.482 --> 05:57.248
You never had any other desire, now that you've 
seen a lot of the country. In fact, I was stimulated

05:57.268 --> 06:09.362
by my experience with the dining hall of the 
Department of Texas A&M, fully intended to come

05:57.268 --> 06:09.362
right back and make a career in food services. I had 
done well in the dining hall, and Cliff Hotard had

06:11.445 --> 06:16.431
told me that that if he decided to leave, he was 
going to recommend me to replace him. Of course, I

06:26.013 --> 06:29.277
was very young at that time. We were naive about it. 
Sure enough, during the time I was gone, Cliff

06:30.779 --> 06:36.565
Hotar did leave and went to Dallas. So I wrote back 
to President Bolton and said that I was going to

06:38.327 --> 06:45.675
leave and that I'd like to be considered for job to 
replace Cliff Oktard. I was that cocky. I got a nice

06:50.820 --> 07:00.553
letter back from President Bolton saying of 
course that that wasn't possible at the time.

07:00.573 --> 07:05.740
Old Jay Penniston, Cliff Oktard's 
brother-in-law replaced him. I did come back and

07:05.760 --> 07:10.366
go to work for Jay Penniston.

07:13.610 --> 07:16.033
In the same capacity? capacity exactly, but I got 
into academics sort of accidentally at that time,

07:16.722 --> 07:33.537
because several of the professors in the Animal 
Science Department were, had gone, were in the

07:16.722 --> 07:33.537
military services for instance. D.W. Williams 
head of department was in the Army, and F.I.

07:39.882 --> 07:46.628
Dahlberg, who was acting head, his enrollment 
increased a little bit at that time, I was off in the

07:47.300 --> 08:03.294
afternoon from one to five, so he came over and 
propositioned me to help him out with their

07:47.300 --> 08:03.294
freshman animal science laboratories, which I 
started doing because I still loved the animal

07:47.300 --> 08:03.294
science field too.

08:06.697 --> 08:15.585
And after I did that successfully for a little 
while, the animal science department started

08:06.697 --> 08:15.585
paying half my salary. And so I got into the 
instructor business in animal science, got

08:16.898 --> 08:25.392
interested again, enrolled and resumed my 
graduate work. I was wondering why you went back to

08:25.592 --> 08:27.716
graduate school. Well that's why. I got involved 
with the animal science department again just

08:28.878 --> 08:36.450
kind of accidentally because they needed help. I 
just volunteered to give them some. Connected

08:41.519 --> 08:45.243
again with Roy Snyder, who was running the Meats 
Laboratory. Got interested again in the Meats

08:45.303 --> 08:47.966
aspects. So I resumed my graduate work for the 
master's degree. Obviously, I didn't have to do

08:53.352 --> 08:55.675
anything about that. I had to get graduate work. So 
I say resumed. What I did is to enroll and take the

09:01.901 --> 09:09.670
second half of organic chemistry, eight years 
after I'd taken the first half. I was encouraged by

09:11.776 --> 09:19.766
some people, like one of the major influences my 
whole life was Professor C.B. Gottlieb, who was

09:19.806 --> 09:22.189
head of the genetics department. And I'd say of all 
the people that I was associated with during my

09:24.452 --> 09:35.487
entire academic career, he was the most admired 
man. Why was that? What qualities did he have?

09:38.390 --> 09:40.433
Because he was so brilliant. But yet, and such an 
outstanding teacher, but still took such an avid

09:40.936 --> 09:54.012
interest in all of his students. Just such an 
outstanding man.

09:59.839 --> 10:03.784
And I'd say that he keeps a carrot in front of me. 
Stimulates you, complimenting you along the way,

10:04.886 --> 10:10.032
sign you, Keep stretching your capability, 
leading you forward.

10:18.511 --> 10:29.326
I know now that he duped me about one thing, one of 
the statistics, theoretical statistician, a man

10:18.511 --> 10:29.326
named Fisher. Professor Godfrey always gave us a 
basis for any statistical operation we're doing.

10:37.317 --> 10:39.900
We had to derive equations and all. He told me he'd 
never been able to figure out how Fisher derived a

10:41.348 --> 10:45.913
certain equation. Would I go to the library and 
study Fisher's book and explain it? Which I did,

10:53.601 --> 10:57.686
and I'm mighty proud of myself that I could explain 
that. I know now that that's just a trick. Gotta be

10:59.888 --> 11:02.631
about to know that backwards and forwards. So 
yeah. He just wanted you to learn that. Yeah, I got

11:08.378 --> 11:09.158
into it. We had a small class. The first semester of 
statistics, we must have had maybe 10 in the class,

11:11.386 --> 11:22.845
and the second semester of statistics, there 
weren't but three of us in that class at the time.

11:25.449 --> 11:37.208
One of them was an Indian student, from India, and 
also a guy named Morris Garber, who was a Jewish

11:25.449 --> 11:37.208
fellow, and me. When Godfrey would send us to the 
board to work out equations or something, I'd

11:39.348 --> 11:46.518
always been good at math. I was terribly 
embarrassed that by the time I finished, both of

11:46.538 --> 11:51.385
them were already through. I found out later that 
this Indian fellow had a master's degree in

11:53.047 --> 12:00.678
mathematics from Harvard.

12:00.698 --> 12:04.483
And Morris Garber was just one of the real 
brilliant guys. Made a career in teaching

12:04.503 --> 12:09.270
statistics first year and then at the University 
of California. So I was overmatched in that class.

12:14.543 --> 12:19.170
Then you decided to go on and get a PhD, and this was 
at Michigan State. Why did you choose Michigan

12:19.210 --> 12:20.913
State? Why didn't you stay here? Well,

12:22.435 --> 12:30.046
in the first place, I was still under financial 
stress, young family. But we got an opportunity to

12:30.587 --> 12:37.637
apply for what was called General Education Board 
fellowships of the Rockefeller Foundation. Now

12:41.616 --> 12:58.216
that was a the general education board was an 
operation of Rockefeller where he was hoping to

12:41.616 --> 12:58.216
increase the training of professional people in 
the colleges of the south.

13:01.099 --> 13:08.147
So I was awarded one of those fellowships so that I 
could go anywhere I chose and I By that time I was

13:08.971 --> 13:22.304
active in national meats societies, the 
reciprocal meat conference specifically, and I

13:08.971 --> 13:22.304
learned to respect a man named L.J. Bratzler at 
Michigan State University

13:22.364 --> 13:34.755
because he had the best blend of the theoretical 
and practical knowledge of meats of anybody in the

13:22.364 --> 13:34.755
country, in my opinion. So I went to Michigan State 
University to work with him.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.280
That's why I chose Michigan State actually. This 
must have been a great cultural shock for you to go

13:43.640 --> 13:50.730
and become a Yankee for a couple of years. Well it 
was. To see snow. It was. I remember we left College

13:55.556 --> 13:59.382
Station in September. It was 105 degrees and we got 
to East Lansing, Michigan. It was 60 or something

14:04.028 --> 14:06.231
like that. My young family and I immediately had 
respiratory problems. And we were not looking

14:13.431 --> 14:20.041
forward to spending winters in the frozen north. 
Remember, my wife and I spent our first winter

14:20.061 --> 14:31.698
together at Onalaska, Wisconsin, and so we were 
not unfamiliar with the north.

14:31.718 --> 14:33.501
But I just came. appreciate enough and praise 
enough the people in the Animal Science

14:34.612 --> 14:48.952
Department, the Animal Husbandry Department of 
Michigan State University, how they embraced us,

14:34.612 --> 14:48.952
took us in, made us feel welcome. Did you get the 
same quality student-teacher relationship at

14:49.133 --> 14:57.985
Michigan State, do you feel, that you had here? 
Yes, I did. Outstanding.

15:04.312 --> 15:07.597
I got into biochemistry up there. Was one of the 
pioneers in the animal husbandry department to

15:09.780 --> 15:20.014
work in food science and really take up the 
background of chemistry required for that.

15:23.999 --> 15:34.133
But the

15:23.999 --> 15:34.133
statistics professor, a man named Beaton, was a 
Texan. He graduated from Baylor University,

15:34.771 --> 15:39.117
where he got his Ph.D. But anyway, that was taught 
in the math department up there. Brasler lived up

15:44.645 --> 15:48.931
fully to my expectation. He was a really fine man 
with an unusual mastery of theoretical and

15:49.232 --> 15:58.866
practical aspects of meats.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.833
So I'm certain that I had some divine guidance or 
something there. It was a very, very fine

16:06.830 --> 16:10.935
experience. This must have really broadened you 
because you had all your undergraduate and

16:10.955 --> 16:19.346
master's degree here at Texas A&M. This must have 
been a good experience for you. Well it was, but

16:23.331 --> 16:33.263
still the coursework I've taken here was up to the 
standard of Michigan State. The chemistry

16:34.660 --> 16:38.366
courses I had here were very, very rigorous. That 
gave me excellent training background for the

16:39.868 --> 16:43.934
biochemistry work. The statistics I had with God 
be here, excellent.

16:54.490 --> 16:59.537
So while I worked hard at Michigan State, It wasn't 
beyond the capability at all, based upon very good

16:59.787 --> 17:06.114
background in Texas A&M. Okay, and then when you 
graduated with your PhD, did you have the job

17:06.134 --> 17:11.060
waiting for you here? Yes, I was on leave from a 
position in the Animal Science Department all the

17:11.861 --> 17:19.129
time I was at Michigan State.

17:22.613 --> 17:28.680
It was an obligation on the part of Animal Science 
that I wouldn't I did not have any subsidy of any

17:29.251 --> 17:35.399
kind from Texas A&M, so I could have taken an 
employment elsewhere. My wife- Did you consider

17:35.419 --> 17:38.804
that? Yes, we were offered a job in Chicago. Okay. 
Had almost twice the salary that I could make at

17:43.290 --> 17:47.296
Texas A&M. Really? My wife- Where? Where in 
Chicago? Well, at the American Meat Institute

17:49.959 --> 17:58.431
Foundation,

17:49.959 --> 17:58.431
a research organization funded by the Packers. at 
the University of Chicago. My wife and I seriously

18:03.628 --> 18:05.990
considered that. We also could have stayed at 
Michigan State University. Really? They would

18:12.396 --> 18:14.758
have given you an assistant professorship? Well, 
no, I don't know what the rank was, but I think yes,

18:14.898 --> 18:20.463
probably assistant professor. There was an 
extension position in Meach that they were

18:20.723 --> 18:25.947
starting that they talked to me about. Never made a 
firm offer. My wife and I considered everything,

18:29.883 --> 18:37.010
and we decided life was too short to live in 
Chicago, and we came right back to Texas A&M. Had

18:37.831 --> 18:42.155
the same salary I left for, $5,700 a year.

18:45.719 --> 18:58.692
So that, again, must have been divine guidance, 
because within two years after we had decided

18:45.719 --> 18:58.692
that, well, three years later, the whole American 
Meat Institute Foundation thing was zeroed out by

19:00.241 --> 19:05.969
the packing industry. So we would not have had a 
very long career with them.

19:12.017 --> 19:15.322
By that time I was department head of the Animal 
Science Department. Why did you decide not to

19:15.342 --> 19:19.487
accept that position up at Michigan State? Sounds 
like a good starting point. Oh, we were just two

19:22.972 --> 19:25.336
provincial Texans. You just wanted to come back to 
Texas? Just wanted to come back to Texas. That's

19:28.660 --> 19:30.062
where we had our roots. We just liked Texas, and 
just like Texas A&M. Liked what I was doing with the

19:35.347 --> 19:39.032
meat section, the animal science people here. 
Jack Miller, who lives right here right now, was

19:41.395 --> 19:45.100
department head.

19:47.804 --> 19:51.649
We were very fond of him. So we decided that

19:51.669 --> 19:58.699
the financial difference wasn't worth it. In June 
of 1950, the North Koreans invaded the South

20:00.113 --> 20:09.963
Koreans, and yet you were in the reserves at this 
time, and you were not called into active duty. Why

20:09.983 --> 20:10.564
was that? Well, our reserve outfit wasn't called. 
We surely were vulnerable to a call. Even though

20:19.193 --> 20:20.654
you were in the artillery? You weren't called? I 
mean- Well, because we were in a military

20:22.276 --> 20:28.062
organization, that is the C and By that time, I 
believe, I'm not sure exactly whether we were in

20:29.763 --> 20:36.772
the 90s. You were in the Armored Field Artillery. 
You were the commander of the 352nd Armored Field

20:38.915 --> 20:43.001
Battalion. Okay, that's 22nd Armored Division or 
something like that, so you see that no major units

20:43.021 --> 20:50.230
were called at all. Individual reservists were 
called, but not any. reserves that were

20:57.151 --> 21:03.960
functioning in larger military, no large 
military organization was called at all. So of

21:06.664 --> 21:11.450
course- So you relied on individuals that they 
needed and- That's right, that's right. And of

21:13.252 --> 21:23.165
course recruiting for the reserves was mighty 
easy along the time because that was one way of

21:13.252 --> 21:23.165
carrying out a person's military 
responsibility. Well what's the effect of that

21:23.185 --> 21:25.348
war on the reserves? Increasing desire to 
volunteer? We had fantastic capability. We had a

21:33.354 --> 21:39.542
lot of ROTC cadets in our military outfit for 
instance. It wasn't unusual to have enlisted men

21:39.562 --> 21:44.968
with master's degrees. We had fantastic 
capability during the draft period in the

21:46.350 --> 21:55.841
reserves. We'd have a waiting list There was no 
recruiting problem, whatever. Would you think of

22:02.925 --> 22:10.775
people who would rather be in the reserves than 
volunteer for active duty? Do you have any

22:11.335 --> 22:12.537
feelings on that? Certainly not. As my sons do 
that, that was one alternative. It was a good

22:18.003 --> 22:27.334
alternative where they would have been able to 
make a contribution in case of general war or

22:18.003 --> 22:27.334
whatever. So I thought that it was an intelligent 
decision.

22:35.627 --> 22:38.951
Did you volunteer for duty, active duty in Korea? 
No. What did you think about the war itself?

22:46.420 --> 22:48.242
Oh, I had mixed emotions about it. I felt like I 
really didn't have enough knowledge to have a firm

22:48.282 --> 22:58.114
opinion or attitude about it. I deplored the 
no-win tactics that we used there and used later in

22:58.432 --> 23:07.044
Vietnam. Because any experience I had is you 
exercised every superiority you could. Of course

23:14.134 --> 23:21.604
by that time we had nuclear capability, extremely 
dominant forces in the world. Of course I thought

23:23.575 --> 23:28.380
we should have tried to win the war, just like 
MacArthur apparently thought so.

23:31.102 --> 23:46.938
Were you in favor of using, I know that you weren't 
in a position of military power, but did you go

23:31.102 --> 23:46.938
along with MacArthur or were you in favor of 
airstrikes north of the Yellow River and using the

23:31.102 --> 23:46.938
nuclear capability? All of my training had been to 
try to to engineer superiority and use it to the

23:52.229 --> 23:56.574
maximum. That's the way you win battles and save 
lives. So you bet, I sure was for exercising

24:01.258 --> 24:10.468
our superior strength and advantage in any way we 
could. Still am.

24:16.995 --> 24:19.958
Unfortunately, we've lost a lot of that edge along 
I'm going to deplore that. I'm sorry, babe.

24:27.199 --> 24:40.332
Let's talk for a minute about the effects of 
McCarthyism and really rampant anti-communism

24:27.199 --> 24:40.332
in the 1950s throughout this country. What effect 
did it have on the reserves? Any?

24:49.261 --> 24:51.143
Boy, I don't know. know of any. I'd say that in 
general the thinking people, well-educated

24:52.917 --> 25:15.463
people, did not favor McCarthy tactics and really 
thought that the threat was being exaggerated.

25:15.563 --> 25:21.670
Though

25:22.105 --> 25:29.413
nobody really was interested in having any 
organized resistance. There weren't as, there

25:29.493 --> 25:42.446
just wasn't as likely, people were not as likely to 
take up a cause and take up the other side among

25:29.493 --> 25:42.446
people that I associated with. Here at Texas A&M? 
Yeah, right.

25:48.032 --> 25:51.235
And then the reserves and wherever they were 
inclined to try to further their own careers.

26:00.712 --> 26:08.741
They were generally Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, 
conservative people. Okay, and at this time, in

26:09.342 --> 26:17.492
the 1950s, you were in the Army Reserve with a con 
group. What's the con group? Let's see what this

26:20.055 --> 26:21.036
is.

26:26.163 --> 26:55.174
That is the,

26:26.163 --> 26:55.174
let's see, during that time, you see, I was at 
Michigan State University, so really that was

26:26.163 --> 26:55.174
non-assigned

26:26.163 --> 26:55.174
personnel,

26:26.163 --> 26:55.174
and these were people that were authorized to 
retain their commissions. They were not paid for

26:57.912 --> 27:01.257
any drills. So you were sort of inactive reserve. 
That's right. You see, during the period I was in 51

27:04.421 --> 27:16.800
to 53 at Michigan State University, I didn't have 
time for any reserve activities, and I didn't

27:04.421 --> 27:16.800
participate in any reserve activities at all. So 
they pretty much gave you time off. Control group

27:18.102 --> 27:20.185
is what that is. The abbreviation for that is 
control group. Okay, and then you returned to

27:23.723 --> 27:27.628
Research and Development Unit. That's right. 
What types of functions did you have there? The

27:32.254 --> 27:38.762
Research and Development Unit was composed of 
faculty members at Texas A&M University. They met

27:39.343 --> 27:48.735
for points only, and this was composed of Navy, Air 
Force, Army people. Fred Benson, for instance,

27:49.390 --> 27:53.656
was in it from the Navy side. Again, we were not paid 
for drills. We met on campus in one of the lecture

27:58.542 --> 28:02.167
rooms somewhere.

28:04.950 --> 28:12.020
We would go for two weeks of active duty somewhere 
in the summer. Actually, I wasn't with it long

28:13.542 --> 28:17.727
enough ever to go into that. It was a pool of people 
that had good technical training based upon their

28:19.276 --> 28:31.015
professional qualifications. Were there 
certain things that you would take out in the field

28:31.416 --> 28:37.606
in research and development? Were there any new 
developments that you had to experiment with? No.

28:44.993 --> 28:47.095
It was a seminar type group. And they were, as far as 
I know, was assigned in your mission. It was just

28:50.618 --> 28:56.683
kind of a holding group for technically qualified 
people. And we were exposed to advances and

28:58.485 --> 29:09.394
developments of weaponry, tactics, or whatever, 
but not called- So it was more educational then?

29:09.835 --> 29:10.495
Yes, it was. Maintained skills and developed 
skills further. Okay, and then in 1955 to 1959 you

29:14.558 --> 29:21.044
became the CO of a battalion. Yeah, I resumed that. 
I was commander of a battalion before I went to

29:24.067 --> 29:31.854
Michigan and really assumed command again of the 
same battalion. The battalion had been

29:33.195 --> 29:38.780
re-designated, but it was the same outfit as 
headquarters right here. I see, but you were

29:39.180 --> 29:44.245
never, did you ever have a command of a company? 
Well, I had the command of a battery in World War II.

29:49.996 --> 29:56.968
So that would put you in line and give you the 
experience for the command of a battalion. Sure.

29:57.649 --> 30:01.996
As you say, I came out of World War II a major. That's 
beyond the company level kind of grade. I was field

30:05.682 --> 30:07.044
grade officer. What was your rank then? became the 
company commander of the 343rd Fuel Artillery. I

30:17.760 --> 30:18.562
was a major. You were still a major at that time. 
Matter of fact, early on I was a major and I was

30:20.587 --> 30:30.229
pretty resentful of the fact that I commanded a 
battalion for three or four years and never got

30:30.496 --> 30:41.066
promoted to lieutenant colonel because at that 
time I was considered to be too young to lieutenant

30:30.496 --> 30:41.066
colonel.

30:44.329 --> 30:45.910
So that proved to be lucky later. What did you do in 
the battalion, the field artillery battalion,

30:46.491 --> 30:53.437
basically training? Oh yes, yes we trained and my 
battalions

31:00.213 --> 31:10.044
we would sometimes go for weekend training Fort 
Hood for firing exercises. We did just like we did

31:10.785 --> 31:14.369
in training in the active army. Okay and how many 
men did you have under your command? Well a

31:19.875 --> 31:27.283
battalion we were authorized at that time I 
believe 80 percent of full strength So by that time

31:29.035 --> 31:35.922
I think the battalion was about 400 men, officers 
and men. How many staff officers did you have

31:35.942 --> 31:43.149
working under you? About a dozen, something like 
that. What was the quality of the reserve? Was it

31:50.176 --> 31:51.237
still high? The quality of reserves around Bryan, 
Texas has always been outstanding because

31:51.317 --> 31:59.025
there's so many graduates of Texas A&M and they 
chose to stay active.
