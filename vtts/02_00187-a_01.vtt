WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:07.008
The 29th, I believe it is.

00:08.189 --> 00:08.769
So it is.

00:09.230 --> 00:11.232
Of January, testing 1, 2, 3.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.036
Yes, it is January 29th.

00:18.059 --> 00:32.434
January 29th, we're in the Evans Library, and I have the honor today of chatting with Dr. Melvin Schroeder, S-C-H-R-O-E-D-E-R.

00:32.768 --> 00:35.691
But nobody calls me Melvin except my mother.

00:36.852 --> 00:38.373
Known to everyone as Mel.

00:39.835 --> 00:46.801
To begin with, sir, to introduce yourself to anyone may listen to this tape or read the transcription.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.885
Describe your background.

00:50.925 --> 00:51.646
Where'd you grow up?

00:51.746 --> 00:52.927
Where'd you go to high school?

00:53.588 --> 00:54.028
Family?

00:54.088 --> 00:55.029
What did dad do?

00:55.089 --> 00:56.771
What profession and so forth?

00:57.231 --> 00:58.292
Where did you go to school?

00:58.412 --> 01:00.514
High school, college, and so forth.

01:00.697 --> 01:06.163
Tell the story of your days before you came to A&M.

01:06.183 --> 01:17.195
Well, I was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, in a hospital that is now torn down but used to be called St.

01:17.275 --> 01:22.240
Joseph's, to name a Catholic hospital similar to the Catholic hospital here.

01:22.260 --> 01:28.847
The last time I was up there was when I was roughly

01:30.430 --> 01:40.943
60 years old, so I was at Saskatoon in 77, and visited the new hospital.

01:40.963 --> 01:47.251
They thought it was a little unique that somebody that was 60 years old would come back to visit the hospital they were born in.

01:48.873 --> 01:56.843
But my grandparents lived in Saskatoon, and

01:58.915 --> 02:12.506
But my mother was brought out to, because they moved from eastern Canada, and my mother was the only girl in the family of boys.

02:13.107 --> 02:20.773
And the boys were brought out to homestead land, because Canada was starting to copy the U.S.

02:20.874 --> 02:28.500
in the way they were homesteading land back there in the early 1900s.

02:30.033 --> 02:41.157
And of course, my mother eventually married my father, who was Milton Schroeder, and was the black sheep of the family.

02:42.233 --> 02:45.236
I discovered that later.

02:46.838 --> 02:51.884
And so I went to Door Lake School.

02:52.565 --> 02:59.853
The town of Door Lake used to have a population of about 20 back then.

03:00.334 --> 03:02.496
Now the population is about two.

03:03.617 --> 03:08.523
And it no longer has a post office, but it still has a green elevator.

03:08.903 --> 03:09.764
How do you spell door?

03:10.285 --> 03:12.207
D-E-W-A-R.

03:14.363 --> 03:15.224
Two words, one.

03:15.805 --> 03:15.945
One.

03:16.847 --> 03:17.868
Dewar Lake.

03:17.888 --> 03:19.310
Well, no, the lake.

03:19.591 --> 03:20.091
Oh, two words.

03:20.111 --> 03:21.093
Dewar and lake.

03:21.113 --> 03:24.117
Well, yeah, two words, yeah, Dewar Lake.

03:26.821 --> 03:40.101
But the thing is that they farmed on sandy soil there, so you had to have the rains just right to do it because they came from eastern Ontario where the soils were sandy.

03:40.958 --> 03:45.447
This is really a glacial outwash situation, so there's a lot of clays.

03:45.928 --> 03:49.495
Nowadays, the farmers farm on the clay.

03:51.720 --> 03:57.170
And in the early days, when you homesteaded, you could take the mineral rights, too, if you pay taxes on them.

03:58.213 --> 04:00.958
Otherwise, they stayed with the province.

04:02.542 --> 04:07.408
One of my uncles, his descendant out there, has a gas field.

04:08.330 --> 04:17.642
And my uncle apparently did pay the taxes early and did take the mineral rights, so he has done all right.

04:20.045 --> 04:27.435
I left there in 1925 because the year I was born was

04:29.187 --> 04:43.909
towards the end of World War I. And they received $5, roughly $5 America, because American money and Canadian money were worth about the same then.

04:46.473 --> 04:54.245
And they had the reins just right, so they got about 100 bushels to the acre, which is very good.

04:54.705 --> 04:55.246
This is wheat?

04:55.807 --> 04:57.810
Wheat, yeah.

04:58.955 --> 05:01.358
But then they had the long drought after that.

05:01.678 --> 05:09.368
So by 25, the drought had pretty well finished them off.

05:09.468 --> 05:13.753
So they left Canada for Spokane.

05:15.055 --> 05:22.684
And so I entered Bemis grade school and then eventually to Rogers High School.

05:23.542 --> 05:26.926
and then eventually I went to Washington State University.

05:28.327 --> 05:36.256
My father deserted us, so my mother had to raise three kids by herself.

05:37.278 --> 05:47.749
And I understand the Depression because I was on relief in WPA, because there was something like 30 percent unemployed.

05:48.490 --> 05:52.755
When I got out of high school, all I was interested in doing was getting a job.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.591
And there weren't any jobs around.

05:59.314 --> 06:06.303
If you had something that showed up, you'd have a hundred people out there waiting to be interviewed for the job.

06:06.323 --> 06:15.655
So eventually I went with my father back to Detroit and worked in a cushion factory for Jenkson Muir Division of Ford Motor Company.

06:16.777 --> 06:21.443
And then I made the discovery that these automobiles are made by everybody.

06:23.718 --> 06:27.167
That Ford Motor Company was making cushions for everybody.

06:28.350 --> 06:31.538
And so that lasted about six months.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.065
I went through one of the

06:36.037 --> 06:38.880
quickest sit-down strikes I've ever seen.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.984
One day I was making 30 cents an hour, the next day about 75.

06:43.465 --> 06:48.911
The only thing is, it didn't help much because everything else went up.

06:51.934 --> 07:00.643
So, when I came back, my mother had decided that she wanted her kids to get a college education, so she had the opportunity

07:01.298 --> 07:07.788
to run a boarding and rooming house for the Kiwanis in Pullman, Washington.

07:08.389 --> 07:09.991
So we moved down there to do that.

07:11.213 --> 07:18.784
And I managed to somehow earn enough money to pay the tuition, which was then $25.

07:22.105 --> 07:24.407
Not like the— What year was that?

07:25.308 --> 07:26.890
That— That you were a freshman.

07:28.071 --> 07:30.374
That was in 37, 1937.

07:31.755 --> 07:38.843
And I'd had a chem prof in high school that I thought very highly of.

07:40.305 --> 07:51.657
And of course, we were benched for a long time from lab work because I and another fellow by the name of Don Clark,

07:53.510 --> 07:58.355
did some mixing up of chemicals and had an explosion that rocked the high school.

07:59.977 --> 08:04.542
So, obviously, the principal made a trip up there.

08:05.664 --> 08:10.709
And so, well, we were the two sharpest people in class, anyway.

08:11.971 --> 08:16.115
Don has since retired as a vet.

08:16.195 --> 08:20.260
He went through veterinary medicine down there.

08:22.585 --> 08:31.731
But at the end of my freshman year, I got a C in the second semester chem major course.

08:31.751 --> 08:34.840
So that says to me, I'm not going to be a chem major.

08:36.237 --> 08:43.504
So I'd done some fiddling around and panning for gold and just seeing colors and this.

08:43.544 --> 08:45.966
So I thought, well, I'll go into mining engineering.

08:47.248 --> 09:01.722
And so the only good thing that came out of that was that I had one year of engineering physics and one year of calculus and preparation before I decided I liked geology better.

09:02.222 --> 09:04.084
And one of the reasons it made me is

09:04.452 --> 09:14.378
I worked in the mines in northern Idaho, and I progressed in my summers, and I took one semester off that

09:19.268 --> 09:24.436
so that I worked all the way up from mucker, which is the lowest person on the totem pole.

09:24.456 --> 09:27.742
A muck snake, you know, is a shovel.

09:28.803 --> 09:46.812
And so the general hierarchy there was a mucker and then a timberman's helper and then a miner, the one that did the drilling and put the explosives in and set it up for blasting, and then a timberman.

09:47.247 --> 09:51.872
And so I worked up through all four of those.

09:51.892 --> 10:02.402
And in working there, I found out that I was, as a mucker, making more money than the mining engineer.

10:02.422 --> 10:06.026
This is one of the problems of the mineral industry.

10:06.066 --> 10:11.251
The professionals, they didn't really adequately reimburse.

10:11.271 --> 10:14.875
Probably the only company that did radically reimburse was

10:14.855 --> 10:16.757
and to contact Butte.

10:17.218 --> 10:26.189
Now, one of the things I did was I joined the union when I was there.

10:27.971 --> 10:30.655
Because you sure didn't get harassed if you belonged to the union.

10:31.796 --> 10:44.592
And later on in my senior year, just after Pearl Harbor, that Christmas vacation I went up and worked in the House Sound Mine.

10:45.736 --> 10:52.345
Well, it's up at the head of Lakes of Land, up in almost the crest of the Cascades.

10:54.007 --> 11:08.807
And that one, of course, I had my union demit with me, so I showed him and said, I'm not going to join your union because I'm going to leave here before then since I'm just here over Christmas vacation.

11:09.192 --> 11:15.521
Now, the other college kids who were up there working over that really got harassed, because that was a closed shop.

11:17.123 --> 11:24.293
And when you're up there, you're really the only ones single miners up there, because there were no housing.

11:25.315 --> 11:31.403
I did have a friend up there, a fraternity brother, that was a mining engineer there.

11:31.463 --> 11:35.689
Now, that did pay the mining engineers.

11:36.479 --> 11:39.902
pretty well, and provided them housing so they could have families.

11:41.264 --> 11:50.812
And you had to be transported about 20 miles from the mine down to the lake, because you had to go up to the head of the lake.

11:51.693 --> 12:00.261
But there was a school down there at wherever they boat docked coming up from Lakeland.

12:00.281 --> 12:01.382
Let's digress a second.

12:01.402 --> 12:02.824
You mentioned Pearl Harbor.

12:03.564 --> 12:06.267
Describe where, how, when,

12:06.922 --> 12:13.035
you heard of Pearl Harbor and what you and your friends, what you all thought that might mean.

12:13.295 --> 12:26.803
Well, Pearl Harbor, I was in a rooming house, which I had cooking privilege, because I generally ate out in a small restaurant somewhere.

12:27.931 --> 12:31.556
I hardly ever made any meals myself there.

12:32.898 --> 12:37.766
And I had the radio on and heard it over the radio.

12:37.786 --> 12:48.201
Well, I would say that the general impression was everybody right away wanted to enlist.

12:50.358 --> 12:58.516
A week later, after they'd thought it over, they were trying to figure out how to finish college without being caught up by the service.

12:59.197 --> 13:03.186
However, I was 4F because of my eyesight.

13:03.757 --> 13:11.664
My eyesight was 2,200, and they weren't drafting people below 2,100 at that time.

13:11.824 --> 13:16.488
However, towards the end of the war, I think they changed that.

13:18.470 --> 13:23.794
So my senior year, I had a job with Anaconda coming up.

13:23.955 --> 13:27.237
I could have got a draft deferment with this.

13:27.257 --> 13:33.763
It was in their geology department, but it was being a sampler because they started their geologists out.

13:33.743 --> 13:35.766
doing sampling first.

13:35.866 --> 13:56.893
But I finally—well, I even did some hitchhiking from Pullman up to Spokane to catch up with this guy in order to get enlisted into the Army Air Corps Cadet Program.

13:57.854 --> 14:00.257
Now, I was—the only thing opened

14:00.929 --> 14:04.735
See, all geologists want to be photo interpreters.

14:04.755 --> 14:08.600
And most of them end up that way in the service.

14:08.620 --> 14:11.625
But that was closed.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.108
The only thing open was communications.

14:15.110 --> 14:20.778
And so I enlisted in communications.

14:20.798 --> 14:28.810
And when I took the physical exam, I had to go to Seattle to do that.

14:30.477 --> 14:39.552
When the fellow checked my eyesight and saw what it is, he said, well, you'll eventually be drafted with that eyesight.

14:39.592 --> 14:45.162
It'd be better if you served as an officer, so you've got to read the chart at 2100.

14:45.582 --> 14:51.713
So it's that third line now.

14:52.895 --> 14:53.956
Take off your glasses.

14:54.638 --> 14:56.080
Lead that third line to me.

14:58.270 --> 15:02.602
Well, obviously, you memorized it.

15:02.622 --> 15:10.525
And incidentally, I made the comment, the induction to the Texas Science Hall of Fame on that.

15:12.040 --> 15:27.126
I've often wondered, I said to the audience out there about that when I explained how I arrived at doing the science teacher program, that I often wondered whether I had cheated.

15:27.166 --> 15:34.238
The reaction was the same as yours.

15:34.799 --> 15:36.883
It brought down the house.

15:38.298 --> 15:43.523
But I guess when you're in that type of situation, it really didn't make much difference.

15:44.444 --> 16:06.465
So, with that physics and calculus, when I finished communication school, the Army sent me to the Army Electronics Training Command as a student.

16:07.745 --> 16:17.161
Now, we had, I think we had about four people from the Air Corps in that group.

16:18.464 --> 16:31.947
The group was about, I'd say about 50 Navy and about 50 Army, so there were about 100 people in each class.

16:32.433 --> 16:37.059
And I was at Harvard four and a half months.

16:38.801 --> 16:47.492
And incidentally, the competition was all physics majors and electrical engineers.

16:47.652 --> 16:54.341
And here are poor geologists in the midst of all of those.

16:54.661 --> 17:01.630
I ended up in the middle of the class, so I thought that was pretty good.

17:05.525 --> 17:14.898
The only resentment I had in that place is in the Army, if you were in school, you couldn't get any promotions.

17:14.918 --> 17:15.739
The Navy could.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.926
So those Navy people got at least one promotion while they were there.

17:22.207 --> 17:27.955
Because we were three months at Harvard, supposedly, and three months at MIT.

17:29.825 --> 17:34.393
And I got graduate credit for both of those, 10 credits each.

17:35.274 --> 17:38.700
I used the 10 from MIT on my PhD program.

17:38.780 --> 17:39.321
Very good.

17:40.924 --> 17:47.194
But another thing I had a resentment for, West Pointer was in there.

17:47.254 --> 17:48.496
He came in as a captain.

17:48.577 --> 17:51.782
He was on detached duty, so he could receive promotions.

17:52.606 --> 17:54.449
He left as a lieutenant colonel.

17:54.469 --> 17:55.731
Oh, pretty good.

17:56.172 --> 17:56.432
Yeah.

17:56.713 --> 17:58.496
Got a promotion every three months.

17:59.658 --> 18:08.593
So, and then got sent down to Jupiter, Florida to be in charge of the radar, coastal radar station of the Signal Corps down there.

18:10.295 --> 18:16.065
So, now, then I got over

18:17.294 --> 18:22.162
and eventually ended up with the Eighth Air Force.

18:22.943 --> 18:24.545
It's one of those places.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.849
I was at three different places over there.

18:27.450 --> 18:29.833
And were you based in Britain?

18:29.853 --> 18:33.880
Yeah, East Anglia, part of Great Britain.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.804
And first base was Alconbury.

18:38.387 --> 18:45.057
And I took, went back there in about 90.

18:46.555 --> 18:50.500
They were having a 50-year reunion of 92, probably.

18:51.762 --> 18:55.627
And so British Airways was running some tours, so I took one.

18:56.488 --> 19:04.259
It stopped at Alconbury, and the PR people didn't know anything about what happened there during the war.

19:04.279 --> 19:05.421
Not a thing.

19:06.642 --> 19:09.306
You'd think they would have looked it up or something.

19:09.326 --> 19:13.812
I found out over there that most of the places

19:15.277 --> 19:26.254
like we visited Bassingborn, remember the picture of the Memphis Belle?

19:27.035 --> 19:34.026
That fellow, the reason he completed those missions is that on the bomb run he was taking evasive action.

19:35.749 --> 19:36.390
When I

19:38.800 --> 19:43.266
got over there, and Doolittle was in command of the 8th Air Force.

19:43.306 --> 19:53.419
He says, anybody that takes the plane away from the bombardier and tries to divert it from a straight bomb on run will be court-martialed.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.926
So, there was a different thing.

19:58.946 --> 20:04.453
Now, there were three officers, types of officers over there that were not permitted ever to fly over Germany.

20:06.155 --> 20:15.811
One was the Nordenbombsite people, and the other was the H2X radar people, because they knew too much.

20:15.991 --> 20:19.978
Our radar was so much better than the Germans.

20:21.661 --> 20:28.332
And so when I came back, I used the GI Bill, and of course I had

20:31.265 --> 20:32.546
couple things on the way.

20:32.586 --> 20:41.554
One, I was offered a permanent regular commission over there when we were in the Air Force of Occupation.

20:43.436 --> 20:59.010
And I decided I would have to take orders from these pilots, which most of them could just pilot a plane, and that was it.

21:01.437 --> 21:14.999
And I don't know how come I got to be a First Lieutenant over there, because I even, when I was, I was a First Lieutenant by then, shook a donut under the Colonel's nose and said, this isn't the way to do it.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.123
This is the way you should do it.

21:17.243 --> 21:20.228
But if you want it done that other way, we'll do it that other way.

21:22.331 --> 21:27.259
So I wasn't, the only people I were popular with was my enlisted men.

21:28.454 --> 21:43.836
Because I don't like to use this word, but I once told a major to go to hell, over the telephone, of course, because he was trying to order me to have my men go out when we had a freezing rain and fix a radar set on a plane.

21:43.856 --> 21:49.825
And I said, no way, you got enough Pathfinder planes for tomorrow's mission.

21:51.287 --> 21:53.710
Well, he says, I want a perfect maintenance record.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.052
I said, that's tough.

21:57.698 --> 22:03.646
If you want the colonel's telephone number, I'll give it to you, because I take orders only from him."

22:07.210 --> 22:11.236
Well, now, the miniature enlisted men find out something like this.

22:11.596 --> 22:11.997
Oh, yes.

22:13.058 --> 22:14.680
You don't have to worry about anything.

22:16.563 --> 22:18.685
And I never had to worry about anything.

22:18.765 --> 22:21.529
I had occasionally walked through the radar shack, but

22:22.775 --> 22:29.982
That war, if they dropped all the paperwork on the Germans, the war would have been over.

22:31.024 --> 22:39.272
Because that was what my job was, was filling out what was going on in terms of maintenance and all of this.

22:39.853 --> 22:41.254
Where were you at D-Day?

22:42.636 --> 22:43.136
D-Day?

22:43.416 --> 22:45.619
I was at Langley Field.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.824
I was in transit to going overseas.

22:53.825 --> 22:57.613
I landed overseas on July 4th, 1944.

23:01.441 --> 23:05.229
And then as soon as V.E.

23:05.931 --> 23:12.525
Day, how long before you came back here?

23:14.260 --> 23:32.427
in December before I got—because I got—the Army Air Corps had feelings that it didn't want it to be the Air Force back in those days, and the Army was redeploying people home.

23:32.947 --> 23:34.750
They had a good system worked up.

23:36.029 --> 23:45.059
And then the, I got, the batch that left before me was still handled by the Army, got home fairly rapidly.

23:47.102 --> 23:54.690
I think I left the base in November and didn't, first part of November, and it wasn't until the middle of December that we left.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.312
So you go back to college when?

23:57.553 --> 23:58.915
I went back

24:00.312 --> 24:05.777
the spring semester of... 46?

24:07.078 --> 24:08.019
Yeah, that's right.

24:08.119 --> 24:08.539
And where?

24:09.380 --> 24:10.861
Washington State University.

24:13.263 --> 24:16.046
I graduated from Washington State with a bachelor's.

24:16.166 --> 24:18.668
I have my master's from there and my PhD.

24:20.490 --> 24:24.433
The only good thing I can say about it is the faculty was different.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.678
And you finished your PhD when?

24:29.978 --> 24:32.701
I didn't get the degree until 53.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.622
53, okay.

24:33.642 --> 24:37.767
Yeah, because I had finished the dissertation.

24:38.407 --> 24:38.528
Oh.

24:39.088 --> 24:41.711
And so I did it in absentia.

24:42.292 --> 24:42.512
Okay.

24:43.113 --> 24:46.396
And where was your first postgraduate job?

24:46.577 --> 24:49.280
After you left Washington State, where'd you first?

24:49.300 --> 24:50.461
I went to work for the U.S.

24:50.481 --> 24:57.589
Geological Survey and went to work for the Groundwater Branch in Miami, Florida.

24:59.138 --> 25:04.025
In those days, there weren't any courses in groundwater, most universities.

25:05.727 --> 25:16.162
This is what they hired me at A&M for, is because I had experience in groundwater, so that I could introduce some groundwater courses here.

25:16.582 --> 25:20.288
When did A&M and how did they first make contact with you?

25:22.230 --> 25:25.635
I think I saw an ad in

25:26.948 --> 25:28.410
Geotimes or something.

25:28.810 --> 25:30.312
About when was this?

25:31.714 --> 25:54.222
Oh, this was in the spring of 54, because I made one trip to Oklahoma, and it happened that the wind was blowing, and the Permian red beds were blowing all of that red dust around, and I knew my wife

25:54.505 --> 25:59.901
who liked to hang out closed and not use a dryer, wouldn't like red sheets.

26:02.609 --> 26:05.878
How did A&M contact you?

26:07.623 --> 26:09.308
They contacted me by

26:10.705 --> 26:11.426
Telephone.

26:11.506 --> 26:13.808
Shirley Lynch was the department head then.

26:13.928 --> 26:14.809
I don't know if you remember.

26:14.829 --> 26:15.590
What's the first name?

26:15.790 --> 26:16.191
Shirley.

26:16.611 --> 26:17.032
Shirley?

26:17.672 --> 26:18.193
Yeah.

26:18.213 --> 26:19.294
The man was Shirley.

26:19.394 --> 26:19.494
Okay.

26:19.554 --> 26:20.395
Shirley Lynch.

26:20.415 --> 26:21.196
L-Y-N-C-H.

26:22.137 --> 26:23.739
L-Y-N-C-H.

26:23.759 --> 26:27.663
And how did they go about recruiting you?

26:28.844 --> 26:30.246
Just talked to me on the telephone.

26:30.446 --> 26:30.866
Okay.

26:31.467 --> 26:33.229
Did you come to visit for an interview?

26:33.429 --> 26:33.609
No.

26:34.210 --> 26:37.253
They didn't have interview money here then in those days.

26:37.486 --> 26:42.050
Did they call any of your references?

26:43.331 --> 26:46.034
Yeah, they called my supervisor.

26:46.054 --> 26:46.474
Okay.

26:47.415 --> 26:53.781
And the only question I'm going to ask about money, what was your first salary at A&M?

26:53.801 --> 26:57.264
$5,400 for nine months.

26:57.284 --> 26:59.506
How did that seem at that time to you?

27:00.107 --> 27:06.092
Well, it was a lot more than one of the Colorado schools up at Fort Collins.

27:08.519 --> 27:10.183
They were just going to give me scenery.

27:11.145 --> 27:19.583
And what did you know, describe the geology program at A&M when you arrived.

27:19.643 --> 27:20.525
What was it like?

27:21.747 --> 27:22.950
Well, it was a,

27:26.575 --> 27:27.796
Let's put it this way.

27:27.836 --> 27:37.665
We had a program that was putting out a lot of master's degrees, and we started putting out PhDs later than that.

27:42.149 --> 27:55.941
The one thing that I do remember is Halibutty had scholarships for master's students if they were undergraduate graduates of A&M.

27:56.967 --> 28:03.475
And when I came here, it was cadet corps.

28:03.495 --> 28:06.579
And no women were admitted during the school year.

28:08.060 --> 28:25.962
However, it's been only ten years since I'd been an officer, so when an explosion occurred in the building, because we had petroleum engineering in the same building, an explosion occurred that rocked the building, and I said,

28:28.203 --> 28:32.890
Stand up, march out, the way they went, and leave your books.

28:33.651 --> 28:36.195
Now, you wouldn't dare leave a book nowadays.

28:36.215 --> 28:36.415
Right.

28:37.697 --> 28:38.799
You could in those days.

28:40.601 --> 28:47.832
Describe the department, who was in it, and who were the most reputable members of the department when you came?

28:49.887 --> 28:54.293
Well, Shirley Lynch was here and Travis Parker.

28:54.613 --> 28:55.714
What were their specialties?

28:56.535 --> 28:58.318
Travis Parker was structural.

28:58.978 --> 29:01.582
Shirley Lynch was just a general geologist.

29:02.062 --> 29:13.937
And Shirley had come down here when, gosh,

29:20.532 --> 29:26.462
I forget the name of the fellow, but he was the chancellor way early when I was here.

29:26.522 --> 29:27.864
He was a civil engineer.

29:27.924 --> 29:29.066
Gilchrist?

29:29.086 --> 29:29.787
Gilchrist.

29:29.807 --> 29:30.709
Gib Gilchrist.

29:30.789 --> 29:33.173
Yeah, Gib Gilchrist.

29:33.193 --> 29:38.361
And he talked to Gib, and he said, I can make this into a good department.

29:39.503 --> 29:41.106
It was over in

29:43.752 --> 29:47.998
Well, science and liberal arts were sort of messed up together.

29:48.058 --> 29:50.102
Arts and sciences.

29:50.122 --> 29:50.222
Yeah.

29:50.242 --> 29:59.716
And he said, I would want to move it into the College of Engineering, and I'd want to add a degree in geological engineering.

30:01.479 --> 30:03.542
And, of course, the degree was added.

30:04.403 --> 30:11.093
It was a combination between petroleum engineering and geological engineering.

30:11.883 --> 30:23.241
And we had maybe about half the students in it those days because it made a good situation for somebody going to work.

30:24.923 --> 30:29.610
And what reputation did A&M have in geology nationally?

30:29.630 --> 30:30.932
Was it well known at all?

30:31.834 --> 30:32.715
No, not then.

30:33.617 --> 30:37.823
Well, right now it isn't well known.

30:38.343 --> 30:46.714
University of Texas will generally be in the top 10 departments in the country, and we aren't.

30:46.854 --> 30:51.380
Was the emphasis primarily petroleum-related then?

30:51.460 --> 30:52.381
Yes, primarily oil.

30:52.862 --> 30:54.924
Now it's more generally related.

30:55.025 --> 31:05.498
I think probably our best specialty now is engineering geology, the geology-related too.

31:06.271 --> 31:09.870
construction or environmental geology.

31:09.991 --> 31:11.539
You mentioned Parker.
