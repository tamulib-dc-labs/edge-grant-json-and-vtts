00:25.503 --> 00:28.907
of 68.

00:31.942 --> 00:39.653
All right, Kay, to introduce yourself to anyone 
that would hear the tape or read transcription,

00:31.942 --> 00:39.653
give us a brief biographical summary. Born, 
growing up, where'd you go to high school, what did

00:40.615 --> 00:43.619
mom and dad do? All right. Tell us about yourself, 
too, that got to A&M. I was born in Shreveport,

00:47.004 --> 00:48.787
Louisiana. For the first seven years of my life, I 
lived north of Shreveport in a rural area. At

00:55.036 --> 00:59.062
seven, I moved to Shreveport and lived there until 
I was 18. My father was in the oil business, did all

01:01.068 --> 01:05.554
kinds of things. He was a pumper, a driller. He was 
an independent oilman later on. And I went to Bird

01:11.923 --> 01:19.915
High School in Shreveport, Louisiana, which was a 
very large high school. There were 800 in my

01:20.275 --> 01:22.238
graduating class. In the summer after my 
graduation, I married an Aggie who was, at that

01:23.880 --> 01:29.488
time, in his entering his last year in vet school. 
And I entered A&M as the wife of a student. And

01:40.025 --> 01:41.568
that's the fall of? Of 1964. And my parents let me 
get married because they had changed the rules so

01:47.609 --> 01:49.372
that I could go to school. As long as I could go to 
college and we could get married, so that was it.

01:56.161 --> 01:59.306
Your husband, was he a Shreveport area boy? Yes, he 
was. Okay. And when you all came over here, what did

02:01.249 --> 02:07.618
you bring with you? A carload of clothes and some 
pots and pans and we moved into Hensel apartment,

02:08.779 --> 02:17.532
T1C Hensel. apartment. We came a week before 
school started because we had gotten married on

02:18.696 --> 02:34.660
the 30th of August and school at that time didn't 
start as early as it does now and I needed to take I

02:18.696 --> 02:34.660
believe some placement tests here. I had already 
taken the SAT and was admitted. I'm not even sure

02:40.649 --> 02:45.156
whether they even looked at my SAT scores or not. 
But I had taken the SAT as a junior and could have

02:45.136 --> 02:52.464
gotten into the University of Texas, so I know I 
could have gotten in on my academics. But that was

02:53.586 --> 02:58.251
what we came over pretty much without very much. My 
husband was here being paid for by the Louisiana as

02:59.653 --> 03:04.879
a vet student. Did you bring furniture? Did you 
rent it? Well, Hensel was furnished. I didn't know

03:10.525 --> 03:11.026
that. Yes, Hensel was furnished. And the one thing 
that I realized after we got here was there were no

03:13.250 --> 03:28.493
curtains and there were blinds, but if you pulled 
the blinds open, then you didn't have any window

03:13.250 --> 03:28.493
coverings, so my mom made window coverings. We had 
a few pieces, but not, mostly it was furnished, so

03:29.514 --> 03:33.861
we didn't bring furniture. And this was, describe 
what it physically, the dimensions of the

03:34.021 --> 03:40.050
apartment.

03:41.127 --> 03:41.848
It was brown. Everything in it was brown. It had a 
brown floor. The living dining area was probably

03:46.313 --> 03:54.524
about 22 feet in length and maybe 12 feet in width. 
The kitchen, I think, probably I could have

03:54.924 --> 03:59.810
touched every single wall by stretching out my 
arms. And the bedroom area was a nice size bedroom

04:00.231 --> 04:03.415
area and the bathroom area. I couldn't guess how 
large it was. Some couples even had washers and

04:05.663 --> 04:10.087
dryers in their... One bedroom? One bedroom 
apartment, yes. We had a lot of, it was in 64, and we

04:12.128 --> 04:24.339
had a lot of returning servicemen who were living 
over there who actually, they lived in the front

04:12.128 --> 04:24.339
half of the apartment and they had children in the 
bedroom. It wasn't a bad place to live. The

04:30.324 --> 04:35.468
kitchen, for a place that has both engineering and 
architecture, the The kitchen was just terrible,

04:35.650 --> 04:37.492
though. There was no ventilation. And I've talked 
to other people, and if you cooked or fried, you had

04:38.974 --> 04:47.262
to open the doors and the windows because there was 
no ventilation in the kitchen at all. And no air

04:48.424 --> 04:50.266
conditioning, of course. No, but we did have an air 
conditioning unit. You could add your own air

04:53.049 --> 04:55.651
conditioning. A window unit? A window unit. And 
the apartment, if I remember correctly, the rent

04:58.574 --> 05:02.839
was $65 a month. And that included your utilities. 
But if you had a window unit, then you paid

05:04.953 --> 05:10.743
additional electric bill. And I don't remember 
exactly what the electric bill ran. Our air

05:13.528 --> 05:20.781
conditioning unit would usually cool the front 
room and maybe some of the bedroom. When it was very

05:20.882 --> 05:23.967
hot, we would sleep in the living room. Now, in 
terms of enrolling and so forth, you made all of the

05:25.347 --> 05:33.019
arrangements to be admitted in advance. Yes, I 
did. Did you come over here to visit during any of

05:34.221 --> 05:36.745
those? Not specifically for enrollment 
purposes. My former husband made all those

05:40.732 --> 05:50.427
arrangements with the university himself and I 
had my transcripts and everything sent from my

05:40.732 --> 05:50.427
high school. The one thing that was rather 
unusual, and I assume because they hadn't been

05:50.828 --> 06:07.017
used to dealing with women who were in the process 
of getting married, they asked my husband if the

05:50.828 --> 06:07.017
transcripts could be sent under my married name. 
And of course the high school is going, but you're

06:07.879 --> 06:10.684
not married yet. We're going to send them under 
your maiden name. And so he had to explain to

06:14.538 --> 06:21.686
whoever was going to receive them that they were 
going to come under a different name and that they

06:14.538 --> 06:21.686
would have to match them up. Okay, when you got over 
here, describe registration and so forth. Well,

06:27.613 --> 06:43.752
the first thing I had to do was take a placement test 
and then I was assigned a professor

06:27.613 --> 06:43.752
and at a certain time and we went to, I went to his 
office and along with probably eight or ten other

06:27.613 --> 06:43.752
freshman guys, and we sat outside the hall and of 
course this room wasn't air conditioned and the

06:44.221 --> 07:08.068
windows were open and the doors were open and I 
believe the gentleman was an engineering

06:44.221 --> 07:08.068
professor and I could hear the preceding students 
going in and he would talk to them about what their

06:44.221 --> 07:08.068
major was And if they mentioned anything about 
engineering or mathematics, he was always, you

07:08.572 --> 07:21.371
know, why don't you take German and I think you need 
to take this class and these are the other classes

07:08.572 --> 07:21.371
that you need to take. And so I could hear him 
proceed with the ones that were ahead of me. When I

07:27.480 --> 07:37.735
got into his office, he just kind of looked up and 
then he motioned for me to sit down and he said, what

07:27.480 --> 07:37.735
do you want to register for? And when I told him what 
the classes I wanted to register for, and it did not

07:38.204 --> 07:52.702
include German, it did include a math, and 
basically it was math, English, and history. And

07:52.722 --> 07:57.467
he said, fine. And that was it. He didn't make any 
comments at all about what I should take, what I

07:59.990 --> 08:03.935
shouldn't take. I do know that if I had asked to take 
a P.E. class, there was the only thing that we could

08:08.937 --> 08:12.863
take was bowling. And I am not even sure that they 
were set up for us to sign up for bowling until the

08:13.344 --> 08:20.073
next semester. But we could not, there were no P.E. 
classes at all for the women. Right. In those

08:25.962 --> 08:29.727
sessions, were you the only female? Yes, I was. 
There were no, I never saw, generally, because I

08:31.129 --> 08:37.438
was a freshman, I didn't see a lot of other females 
either. in counseling or in classes. As far as you

08:40.368 --> 08:43.592
were aware, was this the first fall women were? I 
was under the impression that it was the first fall

08:43.612 --> 08:50.761
that they had announced that. I think that's 
right. That the, although I did look at a book

08:51.782 --> 09:07.662
recently that said that there were women that came 
in 93, I mean in 63, but I was under the impression

08:51.782 --> 09:07.662
that this was the first fall where there was an 
official acceptance policy and we had to prove, I

09:07.861 --> 09:20.420
had to bring my marriage license, and we had to 
prove that I was married to a student, to a

09:07.861 --> 09:20.420
registered student before I could enroll. Did you 
overhear as you walked down the hallway or

09:20.661 --> 09:31.337
anything those first two or three days going 
through these sessions, did you hear any

09:20.661 --> 09:31.337
comments, any I never heard any kind of comments 
directed either specifically at me or indirectly

09:31.672 --> 09:43.311
at me, either in the first few days or later on. Not 
only did I not have any comments, but I was

09:43.692 --> 09:56.312
generally well received and I had a couple of times 
when some of the other Aggies, the male Aggies, did

09:56.579 --> 09:59.625
some very good deeds to help me. Now, in those first 
few days, what did you, how did you dress? What did

10:05.558 --> 10:07.421
you wear? I

10:07.462 --> 10:17.322
was pretty formal in my dress, primarily because I 
tended to be more formal. Generally I wore, I

10:17.842 --> 10:21.810
always wore a dress or skirt and blouse. And a lot of 
times I did wear flats, but there were a lot of times

10:22.532 --> 10:27.762
where I also wore stockings to class. So I was more 
dressed up than what you would normally expect a

10:27.822 --> 10:36.340
student to wear. But I did wear stockings often. 
All right, then as classes began, do you remember

10:39.509 --> 10:44.095
you took full load? No, I only took nine hours. Nine 
hours, all right. And share what you remember

10:47.900 --> 10:51.264
about that first semester. It was very 
interesting because not only was I in experiment,

10:52.646 --> 11:06.985
but A&M was experimenting and taking classes, 
large sections of classes and having lectures in

10:52.646 --> 11:06.985
math and in English. that were geared for 100 or 120 
students and then dividing those students up into

11:07.302 --> 11:25.860
discussion sessions one day or one day a week or 
perhaps two, I can't remember, but I know both my

11:07.302 --> 11:25.860
math and my English class was set up that way. So 
that was an experiment. So I was dealing, I was an

11:27.962 --> 11:35.149
experiment and I was dealing with classes that 
hadn't been, you know, they hadn't been, no, The

11:35.365 --> 11:39.489
professors were usually pretty friendly. I do 
know that I took a history class in Nagel and I would

11:40.650 --> 11:54.504
get there early so that often I could hear the 
classes ahead of me because we could hear them

11:40.650 --> 11:54.504
through the transoms even if they had the door 
closed. Often, as I'm sure the professors might

11:56.405 --> 12:03.212
have done in an all-male school, they had 
off-color stories that they shared with the

12:03.665 --> 12:17.845
students and so I was outside the door one early in 
the class in the session and I had heard the story. I

12:17.865 --> 12:29.942
had heard him tell the story at an appropriate 
time, the historian, and then I went in and I was the

12:17.865 --> 12:29.942
only female in the class and when he presented his 
lecture, he presented the same lecture again. But

12:33.836 --> 12:47.673
when he got to that point where he was going to tell 
this story, he looked directly at me, he paused, he

12:33.836 --> 12:47.673
waited a few minutes, and then went on without 
telling the story, without telling the story. But

12:48.294 --> 12:54.641
the students, the fellow students were friendly 
in the classes. I wasn't asked to study groups or

12:56.163 --> 13:00.368
anything like that. But they spoke to me and talked 
to me and chatted just like you would with a student

13:00.668 --> 13:10.616
any other time before class or after class or I 
didn't understand this or what did you get out of

13:00.668 --> 13:10.616
that. How many other young coeds did you see? That 
first semester there were no other coeds in any of

13:14.119 --> 13:17.842
my classes. You would see a couple of, you would see 
a few women around the campus, but generally it was

13:17.922 --> 13:30.473
hard to tell whether these were truly students or 
whether they were young, staff members or

13:30.807 --> 13:35.313
secretaries or things like that if you just saw 
them walking around. But I, in that first

13:35.793 --> 13:39.919
semester, had no other females in my class. And 
academically, how did things go?

13:46.547 --> 13:50.392
Well, English gave me some problems, math I made a 
very good grade in. I believe at that time the A&M

13:50.412 --> 13:56.460
grading system was a little bit different also. 
And I made a very good grade in both math and

13:56.710 --> 14:03.498
history, but English I was having problems with. 
Any of those teachers now, in retrospect, were any

14:05.080 --> 14:10.246
of those first instructors important? The math 
professor I had, and I took this class, he lectured

14:11.588 --> 14:24.743
in the Animal Industries building in the large 
lecture room, and I sat on the front row to the

14:11.588 --> 14:24.743
right, and I was, we were engaged. the two of us 
often and I ask a lot of questions and would go to his

14:25.398 --> 14:55.320
office occasionally and I believe he was the head 
of the department of the math department at that

14:25.398 --> 14:55.320
time and he commented about my questions and he was 
a help later on when I the next during the next

14:25.398 --> 14:55.320
semester I don't remember anybody's name 
particularly but I did I did do well in the in the

14:25.398 --> 14:55.320
history class also so As you walked down the 
sidewalk, did the Aggies greet you

14:55.655 --> 15:00.588
appropriately? Howdy, good morning, that sort of 
thing? Generally, they did. Yes, they did. And

15:04.117 --> 15:05.701
they were, it was always friendly. It was always 
howdy or, yes, howdy. It's generally the way I got

15:09.509 --> 15:11.311
credit. Yeah. Your husband was in vet school. Yes, 
he was. So, did you walk from Hensel over to the

15:13.693 --> 15:16.416
campus? No, I, we had a car and I would drop him off 
and then I would generally park in the area where

15:16.496 --> 15:26.167
that Reed, the Reed Annex, the G. Raleigh-White is 
now. And so, I would park in that area and then go to

15:27.048 --> 15:32.233
class and then leave class. My classes were 
dispersed and were all through the morning and I

15:32.694 --> 15:39.381
would go pick him up for lunch because at that time, 
the university didn't hold classes during the

15:39.631 --> 15:42.917
lunch hour. So then I would get him and we would have 
lunch together and then I would take him to school.

15:46.624 --> 15:47.646
Where'd you eat lunch? Generally at home, I mean in 
the Hensel apartments. It was, it didn't take very

15:50.812 --> 15:53.757
long unless there was a train. And did you have that 
lunch fixed in advance or did you A lot of times what

15:59.915 --> 16:07.563
we did was we had leftovers, and I would cook 
something that was big enough so that we could have

15:59.915 --> 16:07.563
leftovers. We had sandwiches sometimes. The 
first week before school started, I had never

16:10.205 --> 16:15.390
cooked before. I came from a family that had a maid, 
and my husband, we're regressing here, but my

16:15.971 --> 16:29.044
husband decided that we should go watch the 
football team practice. and I put dinner in the

16:29.378 --> 16:41.505
oven and we went over and the football practice was 
open and we could watch them in the football

16:29.378 --> 16:41.505
stadium. I lost track of time and poked him in the 
ribs and said, We have to go now. By the time we got

16:50.296 --> 16:54.944
back to our apartment, our dinner was duly burnt 
up. The roast was ruined. But generally, I fixed a

16:59.191 --> 17:06.524
chicken or a roast or something so we could have a 
quick lunch. Do you have any recollection as to how

17:07.045 --> 17:11.733
much your fees were then? By what did it cost? I 
don't remember at all how much the fees were. I knew

17:17.999 --> 17:29.691
that we paid $65 for an apartment and that we 
figured that we could probably eat on maybe $15 to

17:17.999 --> 17:29.691
$20 a week for food. My husband's uniforms that he 
wore at the vet school, we allowed something like

17:30.712 --> 17:40.122
$15 a month for those to be laundered. and our gas 
bill our gasoline bill not our gas bill our

17:40.743 --> 18:08.843
gasoline bill ran about 10 or 12 dollars a month 
describe the typical class day routine what time

17:40.743 --> 18:08.843
did you all get up and what did you do when and when 
did you go to bed we were usually up by 6 or 6 30 in the

17:40.743 --> 18:08.843
morning i cooked breakfast i cooked three meals a 
day or fixed something three for three meals a day

17:40.743 --> 18:08.843
and then we would leave the apartment of around 740 
or 745 and I would take him to whichever building in

18:09.700 --> 18:36.231
the vet school that he was needed to be in and then 
drive right back over and park but usually that

18:09.700 --> 18:36.231
semester I had a nine o'clock class I did not have an 
eight o'clock class then I went to class I guess

18:09.700 --> 18:36.231
nine ten and eleven or nine ten and anyway 
somewhere around noon I finished and I would drop

18:36.532 --> 18:40.457
back over to the vet school, pick him up, and we 
would go home and have lunch. If I needed to do

18:41.339 --> 18:55.959
something, then I would take him back to the vet 
school and drop him off, and then I would go grocery

18:41.339 --> 18:55.959
shopping or do whatever else I needed to do and pick 
him up at 5 o'clock when he finished. There were

18:56.460 --> 19:06.133
some times when he was doing rotations that he 
didn't finish at 5 o'clock, but generally I would

18:56.460 --> 19:06.133
pick him up at 5 o'clock, we would go back to the 
apartment, and I would serve dinner, usually

19:06.451 --> 19:10.177
around 6 o'clock. We both would then study. 
Sometimes he went back to the vet school. That was

19:16.407 --> 19:23.278
not often, but sometimes he needed to do that. 
Probably around 10.30 we were finished for the day

19:23.579 --> 19:29.368
and we were in bed around 10.30 or 11. There were 
Saturday classes then in those days. I didn't have

19:32.012 --> 19:34.797
any. You didn't? No, no. He worked on Saturday 
because the vet school had responsibilities that

19:37.060 --> 19:43.049
were on Saturday. What did you all do for 
diversions? Well, during the fall semester we

19:45.573 --> 19:50.481
went to almost every single football game. And we 
went to all the away games except one, and I believe

19:51.288 --> 19:57.735
that was the Texas Tech game. I don't remember. It 
might not have been. Texas Tech might have played

19:59.337 --> 20:01.340
here. We drove to Baton Rouge with three of his 
friends in our car. And we got to Baton Rouge early

20:07.967 --> 20:13.454
in the afternoon. And he and his friends were 
staying in the ZBT fraternity house. and I was

20:21.224 --> 20:25.510
staying in the dorms with a friend of mine. We 
deposited our things, then we went and found

20:26.170 --> 20:30.816
something to eat and went to the football game. 
Everybody was,

20:30.836 --> 20:36.864
you know, in high spirits. When we got there, by the 
time the football game was over and we lost to LSU,

20:41.778 --> 21:10.958
uh... his buddies were very in a very sour mood we 
all met back at the ZBT house and about twelve

20:41.778 --> 21:10.958
thirty he came to me and said the guys want to leave 
because we weren't going to leave until sunday

20:41.778 --> 21:10.958
morning and uh... so i had to go find my friend who 
had the key to her dorm room so that i could get my

20:41.778 --> 21:10.958
clothes back and my luggage which wasn't easy i 
just i had to find her Sometime later, probably

21:11.393 --> 21:21.207
around 1 or 1.30, we all piled back in the car and 
drove back towards College Station. We took turns

21:21.968 --> 21:23.150
driving. My turn came sometime around 4 o'clock in 
the morning. Everybody else in the car was asleep.

21:29.479 --> 21:30.881
So much for chivalry, I guess. I was driving the 
early morning shift. And it was foggy, but

21:35.103 --> 21:37.846
somehow. I was afraid I'd gotten turned around, 
but we got back home. And we dropped his friends

21:42.550 --> 21:45.213
off. And I was very unhappy about the whole evening 
and about being tired. So instead of going back to

21:52.039 --> 21:58.245
the apartment and eating breakfast, we went to 
Coach's. We had breakfast at Coach's and then went

21:58.805 --> 22:02.629
back to the apartment. What was your, at your first 
Aggie football game, what was your impression?

22:09.063 --> 22:12.547
Well, I had actually been to several football 
games before that year. In fact, while my husband,

22:12.607 --> 22:27.823
my former husband and I were dating, he had come 
home and the Shreveport Hometown Club used to take

22:12.607 --> 22:27.823
a train from the station in Shreveport down to LSU 
And we rode, and you would get on the train Friday

22:28.242 --> 22:33.892
evening and ride all night down to LSU. And we went 
to that game. So I had actually been to LSU before. I

22:39.021 --> 22:42.668
had met him in Dallas for several games. So I'd been 
at football games before. stood on the, you know,

22:45.927 --> 22:50.715
watched the parade in downtown Dallas or Fort 
Worth. And you knew about yell practices and

22:50.795 --> 22:53.559
things like that. Yes, yes, I knew about all that. 
Were there any things about that first fall at A&M

22:56.504 --> 23:01.592
that surprised you? Anything that surprised me? I 
guess everything was so new that I was just

23:06.498 --> 23:15.950
accepting everything that went, you know, with 
being here. How long before you all made some

23:16.390 --> 23:22.678
friends over in, with other couples over in the 
student housing area? We made a few friends right

23:23.499 --> 23:32.691
away and, but actually a lot of our friends were his 
either uh couples that he knew from vet school

23:33.025 --> 23:52.317
several there were a couple of those and um and 
couples that we met because we were both jewish and

23:33.025 --> 23:52.317
we met them at the hill el foundation in fact i in 
fact i i know one couple from vet school who's here

23:33.025 --> 23:52.317
now and that's um Bubba Watek and his wife. We lived 
in Hensel together. Oh, I know Bubba. Marvelous

23:58.797 --> 23:59.578
person. Yes. Is he the same vintage? Yes. Oh, I 
didn't know that. Yes. The reason I said, oh, I

24:04.102 --> 24:13.150
would like you to share any and all that you can 
about the Jewish part of the student body here. We

24:13.170 --> 24:14.191
don't know much about that. Right. At that time, 
the students were generally excused on Wednesday

24:15.592 --> 24:22.438
night for religious services. And I have no idea 
whether they were forced to leave the dorms or they

24:22.823 --> 24:40.086
were encouraged to leave the dorms or exactly, but 
most of the students left the dorms on Wednesday

24:22.823 --> 24:40.086
night and the Jewish students would go to the 
Hillel on Wednesday night. We didn't have

24:40.146 --> 24:42.369
services, but we would get together. We would do 
things like play bridge and that kind of, or just

24:42.409 --> 24:51.801
sit over there and talk. And the. And this would be 
what, a couple of dozen? Generally about 12 or

24:58.586 --> 25:03.411
maybe more. It depended on when in the semester it 
was, what was going on, other times. The other

25:11.119 --> 25:19.948
things that happened was on Friday night when the 
services were held, almost all the Jewish

25:11.119 --> 25:19.948
students would come to services Sometimes we 
would even have meals over there on Friday nights

25:20.975 --> 25:26.441
because all the students were living on campus. If 
somebody cooked a meal off campus, they were

25:26.961 --> 25:36.511
really excited about getting to eat something 
other than from Sabisa or Duncan or. And where the,

25:36.531 --> 25:40.215
in terms of hometowns, where were most of these 
youngsters from? Almost all of them were from

25:40.675 --> 25:42.998
Texas. Were they urban or small town? Yes, the ones 
that were here then I would say were primarily

25:50.236 --> 25:59.350
urban, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, although 
there were others from Baytown or from some of the

25:50.236 --> 25:59.350
smaller towns. We didn't have that many students 
from tiny towns, although that I do know that

26:00.452 --> 26:16.817
sometime during that time there were two boys from 
Alice and their last name was Shinus. Right now

26:17.135 --> 26:23.163
their first names escape me, but I do know them and I 
know their mother as a matter of fact. But they came

26:23.403 --> 26:30.192
from Alice and so I'm sure Alice qualifies as a tiny 
town. And who conducted the services in those

26:30.392 --> 26:33.016
days? There was no rabbi here and

26:33.316 --> 26:46.213
Frank Kahn and Saul Klein generally conducted the 
services. with the aid of whoever else was here

26:46.531 --> 26:55.506
that was knowledgeable enough to help conduct the 
services. But they were usually the leaders and

26:55.627 --> 27:00.715
then the students would also participate. But 
they were the ones, the two that did lead the

27:01.116 --> 27:09.771
services every Friday night and on the holidays. 
Do you remember anything

27:10.274 --> 27:16.760
relative to your background? Do you remember 
anything happening that was shocking or

27:16.940 --> 27:20.483
inappropriate or? No, nothing ever happened. The 
religion hardly ever came up in class or on the

27:23.425 --> 27:29.771
campus. It was a time when people believed that 
religion was a private issue and I don't believe

27:30.291 --> 27:39.319
that it was We didn't have proselytizing on the 
campus and I really believe that people, unless

27:39.620 --> 27:52.314
you were a very close friend of someone, you didn't 
bring up that subject. It's not that religion

27:53.475 --> 28:01.043
didn't matter, it was just considered a personal 
issue and not an issue to be talked about. I do know

28:01.804 --> 28:08.952
one time in a class for some, I think it was a world 
history class, the professor asked, you know a

28:09.607 --> 28:38.635
show of hands of how many people it could have been 
American history but I don't remember but how many

28:09.607 --> 28:38.635
people were various religions and then he he said 
well what's left and there were two of us that

28:09.607 --> 28:38.635
raised our hand and both of us happened to be Jewish 
so that was a kind of unusual thing but but that's

28:09.607 --> 28:38.635
the only thing because he hadn't called out he 
hadn't asked for Jewish hands but he just assumed

28:09.607 --> 28:38.635
that there probably weren't any Jews in the class 
And, but never, I was never even, nobody ever asked

28:39.003 --> 28:47.232
anything about that or said anything. So you're 
saying no incidents or? No incidents. As far as I

28:49.735 --> 28:55.962
can remember or would be aware of, there was never 
anything that happened. Okay, on you and your

28:56.983 --> 29:05.533
husband and friends, if y'all wanted to have a good 
time, what'd you do? Well because we were all

29:06.104 --> 29:33.394
students we were all on limited budgets and we 
usually entertained in our own homes and we did not

29:06.104 --> 29:33.394
generally invite each other over for a meal 
because that was probably a budget breaker but

29:06.104 --> 29:33.394
often we would have people over at 8.30 or 8 o'clock 
and we would serve dessert and coffee and we would

29:06.104 --> 29:33.394
sit and we sometimes played games but generally 
would just sit around and talk. If these were

29:37.261 --> 29:45.189
couples from the vet school, generally it was 
about school or the, you know, the vet school

29:37.261 --> 29:45.189
issues. And, but if there were other couples, it 
was just a variety of different subjects. And, but

29:52.816 --> 30:02.706
we very, we didn't entertain or we didn't have, we 
spent our discretionary money I think going to the

30:02.990 --> 30:09.317
football games rather than doing anything else 
like having a good time out other than our homes.

30:10.498 --> 30:12.961
Did you meet Dean Al Price? No, I didn't meet any of 
the— The Ratonier faculty? Right, right. Oh, wait

30:18.927 --> 30:20.409
a minute, let's see, Price. No, I didn't know him. I 
probably did, but I don't know him. I probably met

30:24.994 --> 30:25.875
him. And

30:26.260 --> 30:33.759
in that fall, as far as you know, did everybody 
attend class pretty regularly? Yes. I think we

30:35.142 --> 30:43.864
were all so afraid that it would affect our grades, 
we were all, you know, we didn't skip class and

30:35.142 --> 30:43.864
things like that. And did you sometimes go to the 
MSC for a cup of coffee or a soft drink? Right. We did

30:51.207 --> 30:52.669
that occasionally. One of the other things that we 
did was the MSC had rooms in the, not in the

30:52.709 --> 31:06.210
basement, I think they're in the basement now, but 
they had pianos in the downstairs under the rooms

30:52.709 --> 31:06.210
that they rented. And my husband played the piano 
and we would go over there sometimes on Sunday

31:06.831 --> 31:12.940
evenings or sometimes and he would He would play 
and I would just sit there.
