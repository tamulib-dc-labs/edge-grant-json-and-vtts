WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:07.307
of February, and we are at 14 St.

00:07.327 --> 00:08.589
Laurent, is that the name?

00:08.609 --> 00:08.769
Laurent.

00:08.989 --> 00:13.737
Laurent in Dallas, and talking to Fort Albritton, class of 43.

00:14.959 --> 00:21.309
And let me begin by asking you the basic question, why did you attend A&M in the first place?

00:21.670 --> 00:23.313
Well, that is interesting.

00:23.894 --> 00:29.683
My father was a Longhorn, and my uncle was a Longhorn, and I grew up

00:29.883 --> 00:33.587
attending the Thanksgiving games, rooting for the University of Texas.

00:34.869 --> 00:43.379
And when I graduated from Omaha High School in Houston, I immediately enrolled in Austin and already had a room in Prather Hall.

00:44.781 --> 00:59.198
And someone had mentioned to my father, my father was a captain of World War I, wounded in warfare over there and had a strong military feeling, even though he was a lawman.

01:00.173 --> 01:09.941
So about six weeks, perhaps two months before school started, someone had suggested that you ought to take your son out there and at least visit A&M.

01:09.962 --> 01:16.207
I'm telling you, that is a fine, fine institution for a number of reasons.

01:16.227 --> 01:20.331
And dad asked me, would you like to go up?

01:20.391 --> 01:22.452
I said, sure, let's go up.

01:22.472 --> 01:30.079
I spent an entire afternoon commandant's office, couldn't have been any better.

01:30.430 --> 01:44.243
I was terribly impressed with the organization, the spirit that I could even feel at that point, and perhaps a feeling of belonging, and I never got that feeling at Austin.

01:44.664 --> 01:50.129
So on the way home, my father asked me, what do you think?

01:50.169 --> 01:55.655
And I said, Dad, I'd like to go to Texas A&M.

01:55.675 --> 01:59.138
So I canceled, and immediately enrolled, and they told me

01:59.253 --> 02:03.580
If I'd make up my mind, I said, well, am I too late to be enrolled?

02:03.600 --> 02:07.486
I said, no, if you'll let us know right away, we can take care of it.

02:09.289 --> 02:22.329
And so I did, and a number of Houston boys from Lamar were going to other schools, and I recruited three of them to come, and they came and got in my outfit.

02:22.349 --> 02:24.332
And I was, I guess the

02:25.983 --> 02:30.247
Well that answers your question, why I went to Texas A&M.

02:31.048 --> 02:32.970
Now you're getting ready to come up and enroll.

02:33.050 --> 02:35.712
How'd you get there?

02:36.253 --> 02:37.314
My father brought me.

02:37.914 --> 02:42.759
What belongings did you bring as a freshman?

02:43.760 --> 02:46.062
Very little.

02:46.082 --> 02:55.551
As I recall, we shaved with a razor in those days and underwear and socks and I think shoes.

02:56.510 --> 03:01.356
But everything else was pretty well dictated to what we wore.

03:01.376 --> 03:04.219
We wore a uniform seven days a week.

03:04.759 --> 03:08.324
Describe, physically, describe the campus when you arrived.

03:09.265 --> 03:10.286
We were very fortunate.

03:11.047 --> 03:16.893
They had just finished Duncan Hall and those dormitories in the Duncan Hall area.

03:18.215 --> 03:22.039
They were the newest, of course, of any of the dormitories.

03:22.059 --> 03:25.403
And it was the first year

03:26.446 --> 03:40.184
And the band, both the infantry and the artillery, field artillery band, were in that area.

03:40.204 --> 03:47.014
In those days, we marched to our meals, which was great.

03:47.094 --> 03:51.219
That was the area that initially we were in.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.023
But all the rest of the campus, what all was there?

03:56.095 --> 04:05.549
Well, I guess I could do a better job of telling you what wasn't there, but the academic building was the hub.

04:05.969 --> 04:12.859
Of course, the administration building, which I understand, I hope, will be the Jack Williams building.

04:12.879 --> 04:14.121
That was an important building.

04:14.141 --> 04:21.512
Those were the two most important, and the Cushing Library, of course, was very important to us.

04:21.732 --> 04:25.798
YMCA building, where Casey was, the North Gate,

04:26.740 --> 04:32.028
And in those days we had stables because in my particular outfit I was horse-drawn.

04:32.088 --> 04:43.966
So the horse-drawn field artillerymen and the cavalry, we were mounted and there were great stables across the railroad tracks where the stables were.

04:43.986 --> 04:46.710
And where was the horse pasture and the cow pasture?

04:48.673 --> 04:55.043
Well now I can't tell you where the horse and the cow pasture was except unless you're pulling my leg.

04:55.158 --> 05:12.519
No, I had heard some old-timers refer to where the bonfire is held now, the northeast corner over Highway 6 and University and Texas Avenue, that that was the horse pasture and the cow pasture was where the golf course is now.

05:12.539 --> 05:14.621
I had heard some old, old-timers refer to that.

05:14.641 --> 05:23.832
Well, that was prior to my being there because when I got there, no, that was pretty well a habitation area.

05:24.571 --> 05:28.156
Tell me about being an Aggie fish in the fall of 39.

05:29.418 --> 05:29.918
Fall of 39.

05:31.280 --> 05:45.340
Well, the most impressive thing, initially the most impressive thing, and perhaps it was the most impressive event in my tenure at A&M.

05:45.380 --> 05:50.487
Freshman, in those days we had about 75 or 80 members of your battery.

05:50.748 --> 05:53.852
It was a battery, field artillery battery, it was the unit.

05:55.317 --> 06:06.356
And this young captain of our unit, G Field, lined us up and we all wore in those days those white fatigue suits.

06:06.376 --> 06:07.919
All freshmen wore those.

06:09.241 --> 06:14.431
And they had us lined up and he was something else.

06:14.571 --> 06:19.840
He had the carriage, he had that look in his face.

06:20.900 --> 06:32.550
He didn't say a word for at least 30 or 45 seconds, just walked in front of us, not in a commanding way or arrogant way at all, just mainly letting us know that he was there.

06:33.571 --> 06:49.725
And he was his campaign hat on, he had his senior boots and spurs, and then he came to rest there in front of us and began to tell us what was expected of us.

06:50.093 --> 07:03.827
and complimented us on choosing Texas A&M and there'd be some rigorous times for you because of the traditions that went along with being a freshman and being an Aggie.

07:03.847 --> 07:14.658
And with every word and every movement the fella made, I made up my mind then that I had made my first goal in life and that was to be a battery commander.

07:14.898 --> 07:19.543
I wanted to do with my freshman, my senior year precisely,

07:20.047 --> 07:22.209
what this fella had done for me.

07:22.229 --> 07:27.774
And so it was, that was by far the most impressive thing.

07:27.794 --> 07:32.598
Tell me about dormitory life then for you as a freshman.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.463
Well, it was very rigorous.

07:38.784 --> 07:42.487
In those days there was hazing.

07:44.829 --> 07:45.910
It never bothered me.

07:46.691 --> 07:48.973
We had physical hazing which

07:49.527 --> 08:00.880
was duck walking up and down the halls, and they used to have what they called bleed meetings, and that's where the sophomores took care of the freshmen.

08:01.781 --> 08:13.054
That is, they're the ones who saw that they performed certain things and they were the hazers, so to speak.

08:14.722 --> 08:20.267
The juniors, by the time you were a junior, you really didn't care and the seniors had nothing to do with it.

08:20.307 --> 08:22.309
They did not.

08:22.329 --> 08:23.991
They had other responsibilities.

08:25.232 --> 08:43.969
But there was hazing, but one of the fine things was you had to be in your room 30 or 40 minutes after mess hall and you had to study and you couldn't turn your lights out until as I recall it was 10 o'clock and they had

08:44.708 --> 08:47.251
fellows in the organization would come check on us.

08:47.271 --> 08:53.259
And if you couldn't get on the sack, you really did have to study and I thought that was very good.

08:53.599 --> 08:54.600
You used the word hazing.

08:55.502 --> 09:00.688
Did this word hazing include people physically doing anything to you?

09:01.209 --> 09:03.191
Hitting you, grabbing you?

09:03.211 --> 09:04.353
Not grabbing ever.

09:04.453 --> 09:06.415
We never had to polish shoes.

09:08.098 --> 09:11.001
Yes, we had some physical paddling, yes.

09:11.101 --> 09:13.264
Did that start early?

09:13.868 --> 09:16.751
or did it wait till Thanksgiving or anything?

09:16.771 --> 09:17.552
Oh no, no.

09:17.572 --> 09:20.214
That started within the first week or ten days.

09:20.434 --> 09:24.018
For what would a student be, a freshman be paddled?

09:24.038 --> 09:25.019
No particular reason.

09:25.179 --> 09:26.360
Okay.

09:26.380 --> 09:40.294
The sophomores had full reign of punishment or the hazing thing and there really wasn't, there really wasn't rhyme or reason.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.296
Just that that was a privilege they had.

09:42.356 --> 09:43.757
It's a sophomore privilege and

09:44.193 --> 09:49.699
Some of them took advantage of it to perhaps too far.

09:50.280 --> 09:57.668
What happened if a sophomore missed his mark in paddling and hit somebody a little high or a little low?

09:57.688 --> 10:00.091
I never heard that ever happening.

10:00.111 --> 10:00.371
Never.

10:00.552 --> 10:01.773
Not one time did I ever.

10:01.813 --> 10:06.619
Because see, I heard occasionally that then the freshman would get to return the favor.

10:07.540 --> 10:13.086
I think it was a freshman privilege, but I never recall it ever having happened.

10:13.150 --> 10:16.514
Was your fish old lady a special friend?

10:16.534 --> 10:18.757
Did he become a special friend?

10:18.777 --> 10:21.099
No, you mean the fellow that I took care of?

10:21.800 --> 10:23.042
No, you- Oh, my roommate?

10:23.082 --> 10:23.623
Your roommate.

10:24.043 --> 10:26.306
Oh, I had the same roommate for four years.

10:26.366 --> 10:29.670
The four years I was there, John Weaver from Houston.

10:30.691 --> 10:38.260
Yeah, we were total opposites and we just got along very, very well.

10:38.320 --> 10:39.121
Great roommate.

10:39.141 --> 10:42.465
He became a major on the staff his senior year.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.965
Did y'all use the slang term then, fish old lady?

10:47.507 --> 10:57.162
I think that I've heard that term, but it doesn't have a great meaning to me because my roommate really is.

10:57.563 --> 11:02.430
Tell me then about dining hall events for a freshman.

11:03.151 --> 11:05.735
Where did y'all eat and tell me about the routine.

11:05.755 --> 11:10.663
Well, we ate in the New Duncan dining room, which was great.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.362
And I thought the food was terrific.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.965
I just thought it was great.

11:16.145 --> 11:20.710
We got all the milk, and kush is what they call dessert.

11:21.291 --> 11:27.117
We'd wait until all the upperclassmen were gone, and we'd raise the tables for milk, and we had that privilege.

11:27.137 --> 11:28.939
Freshmen had that privilege.

11:28.959 --> 11:36.147
Of course, we had to pass the food, and there were certain words denoting different types of food.

11:36.307 --> 11:36.888
Share those.

11:37.529 --> 11:41.393
Well, kush, of course, was dessert.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.004
Gee, I'll have to remember now.

11:44.024 --> 11:47.767
What was bread?

11:47.827 --> 11:49.929
I can't recall now what some of them were.

11:50.290 --> 11:51.170
Tea, butter?

11:52.592 --> 11:54.394
I just don't remember.

11:54.454 --> 12:00.239
But there were, we had our own glossary of terms as it relates to food.

12:00.259 --> 12:06.605
Did, let's see, your outfit, did it have a nickname?

12:06.625 --> 12:08.427
No, it was G Field Artillery.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.835
And no, we didn't have a nickname.

12:11.035 --> 12:15.561
Was there any outfit on the campus that supposedly was the leader?

12:17.403 --> 12:21.529
Was there a prestigious?

12:21.949 --> 12:24.492
Was there one outfit that was supposedly more prestigious?

12:25.153 --> 12:26.675
And was there a tail end outfit?

12:26.715 --> 12:27.817
I've never heard of any.

12:28.858 --> 12:31.401
No, I don't know of any distinction.

12:32.002 --> 12:35.066
We were the honor battery my junior year.

12:36.468 --> 12:37.249
But you had to earn that.

12:37.550 --> 12:38.491
Oh yes, indeed.

12:38.511 --> 12:41.015
Well that was strictly the military, the military staff.

12:41.336 --> 12:43.940
How did you get to, based on what?

12:43.960 --> 12:55.517
Well, we were pretty good horsemen and we had a good outfit and we took our training seriously and of course we wanted to excel.

12:55.878 --> 12:56.979
We did our junior year.

12:57.320 --> 13:03.309
Alright, tell me about a typical week's routine for a corps.

13:03.329 --> 13:05.572
As a freshman?

13:05.592 --> 13:06.814
Well of course we

13:08.532 --> 13:27.673
I call them errands, but we, again, it was an upperclassmen's privilege to send freshmen all over the campus cleaning, to pick up cleaning, take cleaning, go get them a Coke, any number of things that freshmen had to do.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.595
In those days, there weren't any automobiles.

13:29.715 --> 13:35.541
When I was a freshman, I don't remember an automobile in our old situation.

13:35.561 --> 13:38.404
So walking was very natural for us.

13:39.481 --> 13:41.864
The campus wasn't all that large anyway, but we did.

13:41.904 --> 13:47.951
We had to go with chores, certain chores that we had to perform.

13:47.971 --> 13:48.131
Alright.

13:49.032 --> 13:51.495
Give me a typical class day.

13:52.377 --> 13:57.923
Take me through from Reveille through Taps.

13:59.045 --> 14:09.437
Yes, when Reveille was sounded we dressed and we had calisthenics every morning.

14:10.092 --> 14:16.584
As I recall, the top kick, I was first sergeant, top kick and also later battery commander.

14:16.644 --> 14:24.058
As I recall, that was done by the first sergeant.

14:24.098 --> 14:30.430
We had calisthenics every morning and excellent drill and it helped us so much.

14:30.663 --> 14:33.026
so much later when we got into the service.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.207
That was a lot of ways.

14:34.227 --> 14:36.450
Did you do that as freshman, calisthenics?

14:36.790 --> 14:42.116
You did, you do calisthenics freshman, sophomore, and junior.

14:42.177 --> 14:45.601
That was, the seniors did not have to take calisthenics.

14:45.621 --> 14:47.222
This was before breakfast?

14:47.242 --> 14:48.424
This was before breakfast.

14:49.125 --> 14:49.225
Okay.

14:49.245 --> 14:54.131
And then you get dressed and go, you didn't march to breakfast.

14:54.151 --> 15:00.518
And you'd go eat, and I don't recall, but there again, freshman

15:01.156 --> 15:02.417
slept at the foot of the bed.

15:02.838 --> 15:07.443
They didn't eat exactly like that.

15:07.463 --> 15:09.486
Then classes began at 8 o'clock.

15:09.506 --> 15:10.267
8 o'clock.

15:10.287 --> 15:13.671
What did you do if you had an off hour?

15:14.271 --> 15:16.174
Usually, I would go to the library.

15:17.415 --> 15:19.538
Cushing was right in the center of everything.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.845
But if you had a couple of hours, you go back to the dorm and then go again.

15:25.885 --> 15:27.227
We were all used to walking.

15:27.247 --> 15:30.150
That wasn't any problem at all.

15:30.755 --> 15:41.568
But see, in those days, I've got a grandson who's graduating now at A&M, and I had two sons go to A&M.

15:41.588 --> 15:47.655
And we carried 17, 18, 19 hours, and if you had a couple of labs, you were 20, 21 hours.

15:47.695 --> 15:51.600
These youngsters today, I'm told, they take what, 12, 14 hours?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.021
They get fussed about 12.

15:53.762 --> 15:58.548
But I have to admit, some of the courses they take, they're tough.

15:59.329 --> 16:00.390
They're great.

16:00.640 --> 16:05.325
I think Robert, this semester is up to 18 or 19 hours.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.205
Alright.

16:06.326 --> 16:08.448
Lunch, did you all fall in and march to lunch?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.288
No, not at lunch.

16:09.569 --> 16:09.849
Okay.

16:10.950 --> 16:11.491
No, we didn't.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.672
Dinner, evening.

16:12.992 --> 16:14.173
It was very, yes.

16:14.193 --> 16:14.554
What time?

16:14.574 --> 16:16.015
March to dinner.

16:16.035 --> 16:17.717
I'm going to say six-ish.

16:17.737 --> 16:17.977
Okay.

16:18.217 --> 16:23.062
And you all over there in the new dorm area, you all fell out?

16:23.242 --> 16:29.348
Fell out and marched as battalions.

16:29.935 --> 16:33.258
Over there in that area we had the field artillery and the infantry.

16:33.278 --> 16:34.379
They were the two largest.

16:35.239 --> 16:38.963
Chemical warfare was there.

16:38.983 --> 16:40.043
Engineering was not.

16:40.084 --> 16:41.224
Signal Corps was not.

16:41.305 --> 16:42.325
Cavalry was not.

16:42.345 --> 16:44.827
So we had all the various arms in those days.

16:46.029 --> 16:49.431
And we'd all march.

16:49.451 --> 16:50.512
It was just like a review.

16:50.652 --> 16:52.634
I mean, it was fun.

16:53.375 --> 16:54.055
It really was.

16:54.095 --> 16:55.256
And that was a chore to me.

16:55.997 --> 16:56.918
How did you dress?

16:57.338 --> 16:59.740
What did you wear to class?

17:00.260 --> 17:09.009
In the winter, of course, we had our fall uniforms, wool, and in the spring we had cotton.

17:09.029 --> 17:14.155
And depending on the weather, we were committed to wear real, real cold.

17:14.755 --> 17:19.801
We could wear a top jacket that didn't have to be government issued.

17:19.821 --> 17:29.811
What kind of... Always our hat, you know, that we wore in those days.

17:30.044 --> 17:31.927
No, no, not on campus.

17:31.947 --> 17:32.668
You didn't wear that.

17:32.768 --> 17:34.511
No, you wore your... Your round?

17:34.611 --> 17:34.952
Yes.

17:34.992 --> 17:35.553
With the bill.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.398
Well, it was all the way around the bill.

17:39.099 --> 17:39.219
Oh.

17:39.399 --> 17:42.745
No, it was our... It was... You mean the campaign?

17:43.045 --> 17:44.488
Yeah, it was always a campaign.

17:44.508 --> 17:44.948
Oh, okay.

17:44.968 --> 17:46.952
Always a campaign.

17:46.972 --> 17:47.072
Yeah.

17:47.092 --> 17:54.083
But I don't recall... I can't recall whether we wore those to class or not.

17:54.103 --> 17:55.866
I know we did certainly...

17:57.635 --> 18:03.782
When we marched, each evening we had full uniform in every respect.

18:03.802 --> 18:06.885
During the day, I believe we did, but I can't swear.

18:06.925 --> 18:08.767
I just don't remember.

18:08.787 --> 18:16.376
Share with me some pranks, jokes, good bull that you may have known about whether you were involved in or not.

18:16.396 --> 18:24.705
Well, I think we had a clever act.

18:25.124 --> 18:32.976
And for some reason, there were about 12 or 14 others from Houston.

18:33.697 --> 18:38.684
I think there were 40 freshmen in my outfit, 35 or 40.

18:38.704 --> 18:40.687
And 8 or 9 were from Houston.

18:40.707 --> 18:41.849
And we were always in trouble.

18:42.330 --> 18:49.140
We had some Dallas sophomores, we had some Louisiana sophomores.

18:49.880 --> 18:55.485
one Saturday evening when there was a core dance, they kept us and wouldn't let us go.

18:55.525 --> 18:58.327
They wouldn't let us get out of the dormitory.

18:58.347 --> 19:02.131
And the fellas that really were part of it didn't go themselves.

19:02.151 --> 19:04.093
In our freshman year, there was an air.

19:04.993 --> 19:07.976
The doors came up within about eight inches of the floor.

19:08.116 --> 19:09.077
That was for air.

19:09.177 --> 19:11.059
Later they took them down.

19:12.500 --> 19:18.165
And so we were sitting around feeling sorry for ourselves, playing cards.

19:19.023 --> 19:22.987
One of us got the idea that, tell you what let's do.

19:23.628 --> 19:29.894
Let's get us a roll of toilet paper and let's get it good and wet.

19:31.095 --> 19:34.238
Let's take one of those cherry bombs, we all smoked one the other day.

19:35.139 --> 19:44.148
Let's put it in the middle, this is the truth, put it in the middle, put a cigarette butt on it and let's roll it right into their room.

19:44.168 --> 19:47.832
And we all went to our rooms and that thing went off.

19:48.301 --> 19:52.607
There were little tiny pieces of toilet paper all over that roof.

19:53.528 --> 19:55.390
And it was fabulous.

19:55.410 --> 19:57.493
Well, you know who was cleaning up that room the next day?

19:57.573 --> 19:58.314
The eight of us.

19:58.394 --> 20:00.697
We were cleaning it up.

20:01.238 --> 20:02.159
But that was all right.

20:02.219 --> 20:04.382
We'd caused nothing.

20:04.923 --> 20:06.645
Turn that off if you don't give in there.

20:06.745 --> 20:09.789
I want to tell you something.

20:09.969 --> 20:11.912
Any other good bull that you can share?

20:15.233 --> 20:20.939
No, I don't, other than just the normal things.

20:20.959 --> 20:22.460
Did y'all use that phrase then?

20:23.021 --> 20:23.481
Good Bull?

20:23.541 --> 20:25.944
Oh sure, yeah.

20:25.964 --> 20:26.785
Bull sessions.

20:26.805 --> 20:29.227
We had lots of bull sessions.

20:29.568 --> 20:31.029
What was it like to be a sophomore?

20:32.891 --> 20:34.713
Well, let me go back.

20:34.753 --> 20:35.934
I do remember one other thing.

20:36.074 --> 20:37.756
We used to have airing outs.

20:38.537 --> 20:44.903
An air out was when the upperclassmen would come 1 o'clock in the morning

20:45.727 --> 20:49.311
They'd have buckets of water or wastebaskets of water.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.615
Sometimes it was warm and had suds in it.

20:53.336 --> 20:56.980
And they all do it in unison and they call air out.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.384
And just as they do that, they throw in your bed this water.

21:01.185 --> 21:05.090
And then they got their belts and their boards and they're chasing you.

21:05.130 --> 21:13.540
And man, you take out, I mean, 30, 40 of us just running like sin in our skivvies or whatever.

21:14.330 --> 21:18.714
And we'd have to stay out there two, three, four hours a night.

21:18.734 --> 21:23.419
That was just part of the tradition.

21:23.439 --> 21:30.066
Sophomore year was, of course that's the year when you gain the main privileges.

21:30.086 --> 21:33.029
You're not a freshman or a fish any longer.

21:33.049 --> 21:40.055
But I had my sights set on, earlier I think I remarked, I really did want to be battery commander.

21:41.036 --> 21:42.598
And then there was a stage,

21:43.692 --> 21:48.157
you had to win the best drill medal your sophomore year to have a chance of being first sergeant.

21:49.599 --> 21:56.586
If you did that, then you had to be an automatic, but you look pretty good for the spot.

21:56.606 --> 22:04.956
And then usually, the first sergeant, the junior year, if you're as good as you should be, then you will go to the battery commander.

22:04.996 --> 22:13.125
So my sophomore year, I had that goal, but I did want to be the best drill sophomore.

22:14.135 --> 22:16.738
And I had fun with a freshman.

22:20.621 --> 22:24.245
But I didn't, I don't think I wheeled very much.

22:24.645 --> 22:26.807
They were good freshman, I didn't.

22:27.268 --> 22:29.930
Do you remember any tricks they played on you as a sophomore?

22:35.295 --> 22:35.656
No.

22:39.580 --> 22:43.163
We used to have at A&M, we called it

22:45.961 --> 22:46.722
What was it?

22:49.084 --> 22:52.868
They, what they do, it's an old, it's an old deal.

22:52.888 --> 22:55.991
I don't know whether you've been told about it, but this happened to me.

22:56.011 --> 22:57.833
I have to go back to my freshman year again.

22:58.934 --> 22:59.915
They, it's Mabel.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.679
Have you heard about the Mabel situation?

23:03.699 --> 23:08.484
Well, about the second or third month you're there, of course you're interested in dates.

23:08.504 --> 23:10.266
You can't get them.

23:10.286 --> 23:13.129
And Brian Girls are about the only gals around.

23:14.330 --> 23:14.871
And, uh,

23:15.914 --> 23:21.739
So usually it's Bryan oriented and boys who live in Bryan, we're in the Corps.

23:22.680 --> 23:27.665
And they tell you about this gal who lived out in the country about three or four miles.

23:27.825 --> 23:32.369
And boy, she was something special and loved Aggies.

23:33.410 --> 23:36.973
And you think we can set you up now?

23:37.093 --> 23:39.215
It'll be a special situation for you.

23:40.356 --> 23:43.339
So sure enough, they come around and they get you.

23:44.028 --> 23:46.971
And do you know, did you know John Lawrence, by chance?

23:46.991 --> 23:49.273
Well, John, did you know Bob Butler?

23:50.875 --> 23:51.936
Bobby Benbow.

23:51.956 --> 23:52.817
You know Dr. Benbow?

23:52.837 --> 23:53.157
Okay.

23:53.197 --> 23:55.079
Those three picked me up.

23:56.320 --> 24:03.547
And so we drove out and it was really where Colterfield is, right in that area.

24:04.848 --> 24:10.954
And you get out and you walk and one of them says, Mabel, hey Mabel.

24:10.974 --> 24:13.697
And you hear a voice, say, who's that?

24:14.352 --> 24:23.460
One of them says, I've got Fort Albright in here and is that SOB that's been messing around here at the house and without a shotgun goes off.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.461
And then another shotgun.

24:24.481 --> 24:27.664
And these guys, you know, they said, God, we'd better run for our lives.

24:28.204 --> 24:30.006
We took out across that highway.

24:30.046 --> 24:31.227
I'm telling you, there was a fence.

24:31.267 --> 24:32.328
There was a barbed wire fence.

24:32.408 --> 24:33.829
I don't know how I got over it, but I did.

24:33.849 --> 24:36.671
And there was a creek at the other side of there.

24:36.691 --> 24:37.913
And these fellas would fall.

24:38.073 --> 24:38.833
One of them would say, oh.

24:39.294 --> 24:40.695
I just knew you don't stop.

24:40.895 --> 24:43.077
All that does is just get you going a little more.

24:43.546 --> 24:45.288
So then you're left out there.

24:45.468 --> 24:46.449
They don't pick you up.

24:46.469 --> 24:48.111
That's your baby to get back.

24:48.131 --> 24:50.634
That's part of the problem.

24:50.654 --> 24:53.338
So we couldn't wait to do it and we did.

24:53.498 --> 24:55.040
A number of times after that.

24:55.220 --> 24:58.424
And I took some of my Houston friends who didn't know anything about it.

24:59.445 --> 25:01.207
And not one of them ever stopped for me either.

25:01.247 --> 25:08.676
I mean, when that gun went off at least the second time, they put it in high gear and you were... So Mabel was a...

25:09.145 --> 25:12.729
It was more fun and we did it right after our senior year.

25:12.829 --> 25:22.258
We'd figure out really some boy that was really a go-getter with the girls, we'd have fun.

25:22.278 --> 25:30.726
Tell me about some of the memorable teachers, faculty members, advisors from your student days.

25:30.746 --> 25:36.672
Well, we had Colonel Bowles was

25:37.428 --> 25:40.291
commander of the field artillery.

25:40.431 --> 25:42.212
B-O-L-E-S.

25:42.232 --> 25:46.016
Yeah, I think it was B-O-L-E-S.

25:46.036 --> 25:51.901
And I'm sure it's in my long haul.

25:53.502 --> 25:56.445
And he was just fabulous.

25:56.465 --> 25:59.728
And then we had the horse officer who was a major.

26:00.688 --> 26:01.950
I can't remember his name now.

26:02.890 --> 26:05.933
But they were very impressive.

26:06.689 --> 26:07.590
Chick Salem.

26:08.611 --> 26:09.312
Remember Chick?

26:09.352 --> 26:10.934
Chick was one of our officers.

26:12.155 --> 26:22.087
And I forget the other one now, but we were very blessed to have fine officers working with us.

26:22.107 --> 26:22.888
They were memorable.

26:23.148 --> 26:27.613
I majored in economics and minored in history.

26:28.434 --> 26:35.582
We didn't have a business degree in those days with either ag-eco or the liberal arts school and go for economics, which I did.

26:36.710 --> 26:42.375
And I minored in history, as I say, and Dr. Stein, Steen, Dr. Steen.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.056
Ralph Steen.

26:43.296 --> 26:50.863
Ralph Steen absolutely was the most interesting prof I ever had.

26:50.883 --> 26:54.226
And, of course, he went on to be president of Stephen F. Austin, Nacogdoches.

26:55.107 --> 26:58.410
Did you all have a nickname for him?

26:58.430 --> 26:59.952
Many faculty members had a nickname.

27:00.012 --> 27:00.793
I've not heard one.

27:00.813 --> 27:02.014
Well, we had one for Gammon.

27:02.194 --> 27:03.495
I guess you've heard that one.

27:03.515 --> 27:04.056
Oyster Joe.

27:04.116 --> 27:05.417
Yeah, Oyster Joe.

27:06.038 --> 27:08.442
No, I don't remember that Frank ever had one.

27:08.462 --> 27:09.905
What about in economics?

27:09.985 --> 27:16.997
Tell me about some of the... Dr. Chalk, I think Chalk had just come.

27:17.017 --> 27:22.848
And there was another gentleman that taught us business law, excellent teacher.

27:22.868 --> 27:27.396
And I was blessed with good teachers, I really was.

27:27.456 --> 27:29.920
Can you remember any of the other faculty nicknames?

27:35.958 --> 27:46.314
It was a nickname for the little major that was really the horse, the real horse officer, but I can't remember his name.

27:46.334 --> 27:48.858
I can't remember, but I was crazy about him.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.661
He was a quaint little fellow.

27:50.741 --> 27:53.025
I don't remember his name.

27:53.305 --> 27:59.615
What were the expected norms about class attendance and behavior?

27:59.635 --> 28:01.678
Oh, very strict.

28:02.823 --> 28:10.211
I think it was as much just an honor thing that we all felt that we were behaved.

28:11.272 --> 28:15.397
I think you're always gonna have a 2% really, you know, group.

28:15.417 --> 28:21.143
But all in all, no, we were on time and we didn't act up in class.

28:21.864 --> 28:24.186
It was serious.

28:24.206 --> 28:32.155
And I think a lot of that just happened because of the

28:33.080 --> 28:40.110
the atmosphere and the way we lived and the discipline that we worked with and the integrity.

28:41.432 --> 28:43.655
You know, that's where I learned.

28:44.376 --> 28:53.649
I learned so much there that certainly helped me during my three and a half years in the service when I was overseas in particular.

28:53.669 --> 29:01.500
But in afterlife, great life lessons there as it relates to honor and

29:02.020 --> 29:14.856
being on time and singleness of purpose and all of those things that really make up integrity, that make up for a successful business life or just a successful life, really.

29:15.317 --> 29:16.559
I learned all of them.

29:16.579 --> 29:17.520
I learned them at A&M.

29:17.540 --> 29:21.845
Now, my father was a great teacher of it, but I lived with it.

29:21.865 --> 29:26.151
I mean, I lived with my peers with that.

29:26.171 --> 29:31.858
And I will forever be grateful for those lessons that I learned there.

29:32.260 --> 29:36.685
Now, was there a, we didn't have an MSC then.

29:36.705 --> 29:41.912
Did the YMCA, was it a center of activities?

29:41.932 --> 29:50.322
Well, I never, I didn't, Casey's was downstairs there and that was sort of a soda fountain on campus.

29:50.782 --> 29:54.687
The barbershop, the one I went to, was down there.

29:54.707 --> 29:59.112
I never did, of course, Yale practice was on the steps of the Y.

29:59.767 --> 30:04.092
right between the cavalry group, just that one street there in front.

30:04.112 --> 30:09.778
And there'd be Aggies all over the place, because we had 7,000 in those days.

30:10.879 --> 30:16.785
And that's where the Yale leaders would be on the top step, doing their walk back and forth.

30:16.805 --> 30:21.831
I remember so well all those fellows, they were great.

30:21.851 --> 30:23.572
Guy and Hall, what happened?

30:23.592 --> 30:28.778
Well, Guy and Hall, we had some entertainment there.

30:29.467 --> 30:32.770
And that's where I got my degree at Guyton Hall.

30:33.151 --> 30:36.735
And it was awarded there.

30:36.755 --> 30:41.339
And as I said, we weren't commissioned because we missed our summer camp.

30:41.620 --> 30:45.564
Went immediately into Officer Cannon School.

30:45.984 --> 30:47.366
Were movies shown in Guyton?

30:52.751 --> 30:53.632
I don't recall.

30:54.393 --> 30:56.335
The movies that I remember

30:56.602 --> 30:58.044
We'd go into Bryan.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.707
We'd go to Bryan.

31:00.889 --> 31:04.214
When I got there, religious emphasis week was going on.

31:04.294 --> 31:07.740
Were there any religious activities on campus?

31:10.404 --> 31:16.915
Haskell, I'm certain that there was, but I don't recall.

31:16.935 --> 31:20.080
I'd only go to church when I'd go home.

31:20.180 --> 31:21.883
I never did go to church.

31:22.201 --> 31:27.045
