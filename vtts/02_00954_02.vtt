WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:08.152
plentiful, and it is more economical than oil or 
gas.

00:11.976 --> 00:22.545
What other forms

00:11.976 --> 00:22.545
of fuel are you using besides the water power? 
Well, as I stated, coal, and then there's not much

00:22.565 --> 00:29.852
coal in Texas, although the United States has 
enough coal in it to take care of all the needs of the

00:30.355 --> 00:36.843
United States, say, for three or four hundred 
years. By needs, I mean to make power and for any

00:38.085 --> 00:41.129
other use. But there is a lot of lignite in Texas. 
Now, lignite is what you call young coal. It just

00:48.838 --> 00:53.945
hadn't been in the earth long enough to change to 
coal. It's... And therefore, it's not as good as

00:57.085 --> 01:06.396
coal from the standpoint of burning because it 
hadn't aged as long as coal has. It still has

01:06.836 --> 01:15.046
some... And

01:06.836 --> 01:15.046
it takes... It's not as economical a fuel as coal. 
But since it's here in Texas, it's primarily in,

01:18.991 --> 01:26.940
say, from Bastrop towards Texarkana. There's an 
area in there, the Aluminum Company of America has

01:27.275 --> 01:41.348
a tremendous lignite plant at Rockdale, and the 
Texas Power and Light Company buys power from it

01:27.275 --> 01:41.348
when they're not using it at the plant. Then Texas 
Power and Light Company and Texas Utilities,

01:41.388 --> 01:54.000
Dallas Power and Light, are building or have built 
a big lignite plant on beyond Rockdale going

01:41.388 --> 01:54.000
towards Texarkana. Now LCRA is trying to build it, 
lignite plant near LaGrange or add to their coal

01:57.515 --> 02:05.483
plant but instead of burning coal burn lignite. 
It's a little more difficult to burn lignite and

02:06.024 --> 02:24.383
but as I say since you don't have to ship it all the 
way from Wyoming it would be more economical and

02:06.024 --> 02:24.383
since people are so dependent on electric power 
this day and time for their mode of living why it's

02:24.734 --> 02:36.145
up to the utilities to get them the power at the most 
economical rate that they can because otherwise

02:24.734 --> 02:36.145
the people couldn't use it. And so the LCRA at the 
present time is considering building a lignite

02:37.166 --> 02:44.473
plant. They are not considering building a 
nuclear plant at the present time. And of course

02:51.580 --> 02:53.222
there are no other fuels that are available. They 
talk about them in the paper, about burning

02:55.520 --> 03:14.400
garbage and burning, I mean, solar power and wind 
power, windmills and things like that, but

02:55.520 --> 03:14.400
they're just sort of things that are way out and And 
maybe they'll get some benefit out of it, maybe

03:14.768 --> 03:26.924
solar power after the year 2000 or beyond that, but 
not anytime soon. So actually the only thing that

03:26.944 --> 03:35.675
they've got is to either burn oil, burn gas, or burn 
coal or burn lignite. And oil is expensive and gas

03:36.776 --> 03:41.282
is expensive and Although now that they're 
finding so much gas, there is a movement on to have

03:41.752 --> 03:55.887
Congress repeal the law saying that you can't 
build electric generating plants that will burn

03:41.752 --> 03:55.887
gas. And they may do that. If they do, why, they may 
go back to burning gas. That's why all the plants in

04:02.894 --> 04:10.662
Texas were burning gas until just recently. 
because there was plenty of gas in Texas, and it

04:11.097 --> 04:29.287
was a very economical fuel, it was a very clean 
fuel, and you don't have a lot of trash to dispose of

04:11.097 --> 04:29.287
after you burn it. But that is the situation now 
insofar as Electric power in the near future, I'd

04:36.663 --> 04:49.179
say in the next 10, 15, 20 years is going to have to 
come from coal, lignite, or gas, or nuclear power.

04:49.479 --> 04:53.164
There's just not going to be any other source. You 
mentioned that the SRA sells their energy to

04:53.865 --> 05:01.455
cities and townships and stuff like that. Is their 
rates comparable to private companies? Well,

05:06.835 --> 05:13.803
their rate was more economical in the early years. 
From 1940 to 1965, I'd say 25 years, the people in

05:13.843 --> 05:34.547
Central Texas saved, by virtue of the LCRA rates, 
upward of all around $10 million, maybe up to $10

05:13.843 --> 05:34.547
million a year. average so they've served over 
saved over a quarter of a billion dollars in the 25

05:34.932 --> 05:55.438
years that on electric rates that that money was 
able to stay in central texas and and spent by the

05:34.932 --> 05:55.438
people themselves rather than paid for 
electricity now after the uh oil embargo and when

05:34.932 --> 05:55.438
they made them and the price of oil went so high and 
then gas went so high. While the rates of LCRA are

06:00.748 --> 06:09.919
comparable to the rates of private utilities but 
they are still a little bit lower I understand. I

06:10.559 --> 06:12.962
haven't kept up with it the last seven years.

06:15.805 --> 06:19.209
You mentioned the other authorities that are in 
Texas. Is the LCRA the largest one? From the

06:24.325 --> 06:34.721
standpoint of business and income, it is much the 
largest because of the electric utility,

06:24.325 --> 06:34.721
electric business. None of the other authorities 
have any electric power except the Brazos River

06:36.283 --> 06:45.938
Authority, and they sell their power at the dam. 
They don't wholesale it to cities or rural

06:46.058 --> 06:51.126
electric cooperatives like the LCRA. And they 
have a little power at Possum Kingdom Dam and then a

06:51.545 --> 06:58.134
little power at Whitney Dam. But it doesn't amount 
to too much. And their revenue then comes

07:00.037 --> 07:08.149
primarily from selling water for irrigation and 
for municipal uses. And then they've gone in the

07:08.669 --> 07:11.173
sewerage business. of building sewage plants for 
cities, small cities that couldn't afford to, the

07:11.542 --> 07:19.991
River Authority has built them and runs it for 
them. And that's the same thing with the Trinity

07:20.772 --> 07:30.822
River Authority and others, but from standpoint 
of income, that of course is one of the great

07:20.772 --> 07:30.822
changes in the last few years. When I was there, I 
think our income went up from about $2 million a

07:31.263 --> 07:38.971
year to about $20 million a year. Well now, it's 
well above $100 million and going up much more than

07:41.495 --> 07:52.105
that on account of the price of electricity having 
gone up so much. Their power bill runs millions of

07:52.946 --> 07:58.030
dollars a month. That's the basis of the electric 
load growing so much. You mentioned that they're

08:07.139 --> 08:10.422
building more and more plants, energy plants, are 
they expanding their output to different cities?

08:18.154 --> 08:20.399
Is their area expanding? The geographical area is 
not expanding, but the load is growing because the

08:20.920 --> 08:32.022
number of people in the area is expanding. More 
people are moving into central Texas, and the

08:32.508 --> 08:41.237
population is growing, and the use of electric 
power is growing. So what you have is that they

08:41.718 --> 08:50.007
still serve only the same places they served 20 
years ago. But it's like, just for example, the

08:50.808 --> 08:54.471
city of Austin. 20 years ago, probably had 100,000 
people, 120,000. Today it has nearly 400,000.

09:01.128 --> 09:03.572
Well, it takes four times as much electricity. 
Well, that's the same thing with the LCRA. It is

09:07.398 --> 09:14.969
serving today much more than four times as much 
electricity to the same area that it served. So it

09:15.550 --> 09:26.928
has to expand, otherwise the people wouldn't be 
able to buy electric power, and they'd have to go

09:15.550 --> 09:26.928
elsewhere to buy it, which they don't want to do, of 
course. Is there any... ill feelings or animosity

09:30.794 --> 09:34.499
between the LCRA and private companies? Well, 
that's what I mentioned a while ago. There was in

09:38.325 --> 09:46.918
the beginning, because the feeling was that the 
LCRA would be going into the business of the

09:38.325 --> 09:46.918
private utilities. But that has died, I think, 
completely now in the last 20 or 30 years, well,

09:46.938 --> 09:52.746
since 1950. And it came about, I think, by virtue of 
the fact they worked together so closely during

09:53.888 --> 09:59.316
the war. uh and now all of them feel that each of them 
needs each other they're all interconnected they

09:59.785 --> 10:24.375
they if one of them loses a power plant while the 
other one uh sends the power in until they can get it

09:59.785 --> 10:24.375
fixed and all those kind of things so i don't think 
there's any there's just a feeling of working

09:59.785 --> 10:24.375
together the same kind of feeling, though, that 
anybody who's in the same business is going to

10:25.081 --> 10:28.605
feel. He's going to feel that his business is 
better, but he doesn't want the other one put out of

10:28.665 --> 10:48.750
business because he realizes that they're doing a 
good job and that also it's much better that they be

10:28.665 --> 10:48.750
there and doing what they're doing.

10:48.770 --> 10:54.177
How does the LCRA handle flood situations in 
Texas? What the LCRA has done and built up is they

10:54.494 --> 11:07.312
have numerous people located on farms and ranches 
all above the dams. And they furnish them water

11:08.153 --> 11:13.300
gauges and rain gauges. And whenever it rains more 
than an inch, they call the LCRA collect and tell

11:13.440 --> 11:22.493
them how much it has rained. There are about, oh, I 
think 50 or more of those, probably more than that,

11:23.097 --> 11:38.772
rain gauges scattered all the way from Burn It 
Clear out in West Texas on various farms and

11:23.097 --> 11:38.772
ranches. And then when the water gets to the creeks 
and then into a river, while we have people

11:39.392 --> 11:49.982
stationed that live there that go down and measure 
the river. and say how much the river has risen, how

11:50.435 --> 11:53.639
many feet. And then the LCRA has measured that so 
they know that if the San Salvador River at a

11:54.360 --> 12:18.231
certain place has risen 10 feet and is now 15 feet 
high, they know how much water that is and how much

11:54.360 --> 12:18.231
water it will put in the lake, let's say Lake 
Buckhannon, because that's where the San

11:54.360 --> 12:18.231
Salvador River comes into, if it runs for 24 hours. 
And so what they have are rain gauge people that

12:18.751 --> 12:25.842
call in and tell them when they're raining. And if 
it rains more than an inch, they call in on the first

12:26.262 --> 12:33.293
inch, and then every time it rains as much as 
another inch, they call in. Now when it rains 10 or

12:33.914 --> 12:43.968
12 inches, which causes the floods, a lot of times 
they can't call in on account of the rain, and we

12:33.914 --> 12:43.968
don't hear from them until after the rain is over. 
But by then we know that there's a big rain. Now,

12:47.489 --> 12:49.652
that was before the day of radar. Now you have radar 
that scans the country, and the weathermen advise

12:49.672 --> 13:15.066
the LCRA, but we still have the rain gauges out on 
the farms, and they call in and say how much rain

12:49.672 --> 13:15.066
they have, whether the creeks are running, and 
then the people on the rivers, the San Salvador

12:49.672 --> 13:15.066
River, the Brady Creek, the Pecan Bow, the Concho 
Rivers, and the Llano Rivers, and the Pertinellas

12:49.672 --> 13:15.066
River, They all call in and say how much water is 
coming down. And when you're seeing some of those

13:19.487 --> 13:24.913
places, it takes the water two to three days to get 
to the lakes. Just like when you release it here in

13:25.634 --> 13:33.683
Austin, it takes five days for it to go all the way 
down to the coast. So we have to figure out the days.

13:36.807 --> 13:38.268
We know how much water is coming. We know how much 
water we can hold in the lakes. And if necessary, we

13:41.945 --> 13:55.441
start releasing water, but try not to release any 
more than the river below us can hold, keeping in

13:41.945 --> 13:55.441
mind it's going to take five days for it to get to the 
coast. So it's what it is. It's based on plans and

13:58.164 --> 14:09.758
figures and calculations that have been made as to 
how much water is coming in and how much water you

13:58.164 --> 14:09.758
can let out without flooding people.

14:15.509 --> 14:23.476
How exactly is the transition made from LCRA 
electricity to actual home electricity? Well,

14:23.616 --> 14:40.932
what the LCRA does is it sells the electricity 
wholesale, except it does sell retail in

14:23.616 --> 14:40.932
Kerrville, San Marcos, and San Salvo because 
those towns voted that it wanted the LCRA to run

14:23.616 --> 14:40.932
their system. But the LCRA sells wholesale to a 
town, say, Brenham, and Brenham, the city buys it,

14:46.053 --> 14:53.383
and the city owns all the electric lines in the 
city. And they then take, they have their own

14:53.984 --> 15:03.136
electric system, they're people working for 
them, and they take the power at the substation and

14:53.984 --> 15:03.136
deliver it. It's delivered over their lines to the 
towns, I mean the cities, the stores, the filling

15:03.297 --> 15:13.731
stations, the schools, and they collect and they 
use that money to help run the city. and build

15:14.268 --> 15:18.494
swimming pools and parks and other things. And the 
LCRA sells to rural cooperatives and they take the

15:19.155 --> 15:39.702
power to the farms and the ranches and they collect 
for it and pay off their debts that they borrowed

15:19.155 --> 15:39.702
their money from the Rural Electric 
Administration in Washington and they're paying

15:19.155 --> 15:39.702
off their debts and pay their expenses of their 
employees. So what the LCRA does is generate the

15:42.039 --> 16:07.579
electricity and takes it to these cities, 29 of 
them, like Georgetown, San Salvador, Kerrville,

15:42.039 --> 16:07.579
and Burnett, and Llano, and all the others, and the 
rural electric cooperatives like the Blue Bonnet

15:42.039 --> 16:07.579
Co-op, the co-op down at Fayetteville, Fayette 
County Co-op and San Bernard Co-op and all of them,

16:08.302 --> 16:14.713
it takes it to them at their substation. Then they 
deliver it out to the people and collect for

16:14.773 --> 16:21.465
it. And each one of them fixes its own retail rate. 
So while the LCRA charges all of them the same for

16:24.570 --> 16:33.465
the electricity that's delivered to them, so much 
a kilowatt and so much a kilowatt hour, The city or

16:34.171 --> 16:39.661
the cooperative can charge a different rate if it 
wants to, if it has to. It depends on what the

16:39.741 --> 16:42.446
problems are in delivering it. So some of the rates 
may be different in the cities and the co-ops than

16:42.966 --> 16:51.562
in others, but that's because of their own 
problems. But the LCRA sells them all at the same

16:51.582 --> 16:55.268
price.
