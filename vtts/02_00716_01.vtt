00:02.056 --> 00:06.421
William Wooten, director of the Texas 
Transportation Institute. Today's date is July

00:06.501 --> 00:08.283
the 30th. Dr. Wooten, could we begin by, you're 
telling us something about your background.

00:14.109 --> 00:24.381
Well, I was born out in the country, about 15 miles 
from the town of Junction, Texas, which is up in the

00:14.109 --> 00:24.381
hill country. I went to school in Austin. Well, 
it's northwest a little of Austin. Kimball

00:31.807 --> 00:36.914
County, which is up on the Balcones Escarpment. 
It's sheep and goat country, rush country. Its

00:41.660 --> 00:57.161
nearest large town is probably closer to 
Kerrville than any other, and San Angelo was

00:41.660 --> 00:57.161
probably the major regional shopping center for 
that, if there was such a thing at that time, as a

00:41.660 --> 00:57.161
regional shopping center. It was the place that 
people went to. Do major trading. That's there

01:00.865 --> 01:03.208
where some of those coal streams run through it. 
Right, right. I went to school and started in a

01:06.492 --> 01:17.547
little school that's no longer in existence at 
Teacup, Texas. One word, Teacup. Right, it's

01:19.249 --> 01:23.515
named after a little mountain that is... looks 
like an inverted teacup, comes up with a little rim

01:24.338 --> 01:28.342
on top. And there was a little two-room school 
there with a little store at that time. And

01:37.870 --> 01:52.624
then went to a couple of years at London, which is 
about seven or eight miles away, and then finished

01:37.870 --> 01:52.624
up, I think, from the fifth grade on in Junction. 
high school there and graduated from there in

01:53.650 --> 01:57.175
1943.

02:02.102 --> 02:12.757
We had a farm and ranch combined, let's say it was 
about 13, 14 miles out of junction. You had cattle

02:12.777 --> 02:13.799
and sheep? Cattle and sheep, primarily sheep and 
goats. Sheep and goats, that's all brush country

02:17.123 --> 02:20.468
and it's sheep and goat country.

02:24.346 --> 02:28.291
What memories do you have of the Depression as a 
boy? I was still a little bit small when the major

02:28.311 --> 02:32.196
effects of the Depression came. I was born in 26, 
and the Depression really started hitting, I

02:32.857 --> 02:39.705
guess, in 29 to 30. My primary memories was a 
society totally without money in our area. We

02:48.115 --> 02:51.079
almost reverted to a barter system. during that 
period, cash crops or cash income was very hard to

02:52.173 --> 02:58.800
generate. And we had no real

03:00.282 --> 03:12.356
severe problems other than those problems 
associated with having no money. We always had

03:13.036 --> 03:18.923
plenty of food and plenty to eat and got by very 
well. But it was a real experience looking back on

03:19.308 --> 03:35.829
it to see that you traded

03:19.308 --> 03:35.829
eggs or a calf or something else that you needed. 
And it brought about, of course, as I guess most

03:35.849 --> 03:48.285
periods of adversity does, a pretty strong 
interdependence with your neighbors. You

03:48.805 --> 04:01.238
shared, you killed a calf, and you split it up 
between various neighbors, and then they did the

03:48.805 --> 04:01.238
same when they, of course, at that time there was no 
refrigeration or anything, so there was a need to

03:48.805 --> 04:01.238
do that too. But a lot of neighbor interaction, 
because everybody was in the same general

04:02.139 --> 04:16.875
condition of no money and plenty of food, just 
spread it around like that. So it was... It was a

04:18.826 --> 04:25.193
unique era to grow up in in that part of the world. It 
was no major hardships, but looking back on it and

04:26.574 --> 04:45.795
looking at the complete lack of cash money, part of 
that country, in an attempt to develop cash, some

04:26.574 --> 04:45.795
sort of cash income, Planted cotton, and of course 
that is a terrible area of the state to try to grow

04:46.923 --> 04:53.732
cotton up in those hills. But it was just an attempt 
to try to generate something that would, to have

04:54.713 --> 05:01.181
something that would generate cash income. It was 
unsuccessful. Right. If you could get a half a bale

05:05.887 --> 05:12.475
to the acre or a quarter of a bale to the acre, that 
was considered to be a pretty good crop. And, of

05:13.417 --> 05:16.963
course, there's no cotton grown in that part of the 
world now. But during that period of the

05:17.203 --> 05:24.495
Depression, there was a gin located about seven, 
eight miles away. But we lived very well during the

05:26.818 --> 05:32.768
periods of the Depression.

05:35.272 --> 05:37.315
Living without money is not all that bad if you 
self-sustaining self-sustaining it quite well

05:38.223 --> 06:06.778
okay when you finished high school in 1943 what did 
you do then my first uh i had i have uh five four

05:38.223 --> 06:06.778
brothers there are five of us and of course world 
war ii was going on at that time and my first uh

05:38.223 --> 06:06.778
interest of course was getting into the service 
before the war was over and i didn't get to

05:38.223 --> 06:06.778
participate i had a brother who who was flying 
B-24s at that time and I took a trip to Tarrant Field

06:07.417 --> 06:34.099
in Fort Worth where he was based at the time and went 
through a B-24 and I thought that was the greatest

06:07.417 --> 06:34.099
thing that I'd ever seen and the one thing for me to 
would be to be able to fly so

06:07.417 --> 06:34.099
I immediately applied for the Air Force or at that 
time the Army Air Corps in San Antonio. I took the

06:41.926 --> 07:02.567
physical examinations and all of the written 
tests that they provided at the time and then went

06:41.926 --> 07:02.567
back home to wait to see if I were going to be 
accepted and of course I was only 17 at the time so I

07:04.235 --> 07:07.820
Went back to, they told me to come back, I believe, 
in two weeks, and I did. And they said, oh, yeah, I'd

07:07.840 --> 07:15.750
passed all of the examinations, both physically 
and the written tests. And I said, great, when do I

07:15.770 --> 07:17.272
go in? And they said, well, we can't take you until 
you're 18. Well, that was pretty disturbing. So on

07:27.605 --> 07:33.432
the way out, this was in the, I believe they called 
it the post office building in San Antonio. It was

07:34.812 --> 08:00.904
up on the second floor, as I recall, and as I was 
walking out very dejectedly from the Air Force Air

07:34.812 --> 08:00.904
Corps recruiting office, going down the hall, 
here was this other recruiting office with a

07:34.812 --> 08:00.904
Marine sergeant standing there with his blue 
uniform with the stripes down the trousers and all

07:34.812 --> 08:00.904
of the red insignia on his arms and He said, what's 
the matter, son? Wouldn't they take you in the Air

08:02.981 --> 08:04.302
Force? And I said, oh, yeah, they'll take me, but 
I've got to wait until I'm 18. And he said, well,

08:08.286 --> 08:11.569
have you ever thought about joining the Marine 
Corps? And I said, well, no, I really hadn't

08:11.589 --> 08:14.051
because I want to fly. He said, well, don't you know 
that the Marine Corps has the greatest Air Corps of

08:15.532 --> 08:24.060
all the services? And I said, no, I really didn't. I 
didn't know much about it. He said, oh, yeah. I

08:28.284 --> 08:29.625
said, we have the. finest airplanes and the finest 
pilots and all of the services. I said, well, that

08:34.824 --> 08:40.953
doesn't make any difference to me whether I fly for 
the Marine Corps or for the Army as long as I get to

08:34.824 --> 08:40.953
fly. He said, well, come on in and I'll sign you up 
and I'll put on your papers that I said, of course,

08:40.973 --> 08:56.857
everybody has to go through boot camp when they go 
into the Marine Corps, but I'll put on your papers

08:40.973 --> 08:56.857
that you're going to go to flight school as soon as 
your boot camp's over. Great, that's fine. Well, I

08:58.799 --> 09:00.221
didn't go immediately then. I didn't enter until 
March the next year. This was in October. But when I

09:06.411 --> 09:15.245
did go in, I was almost through boot camp before I 
finally learned that the Marine Corps didn't have

09:06.411 --> 09:15.245
a pilot training program at all. They got theirs 
out of the Navy. So that's the way I got into the

09:16.847 --> 09:22.316
Marine Corps. I was going in to fly and found out 
they didn't even have a pilot training program.

09:33.477 --> 09:40.346
At that time, we were having some pretty strong 
needs in the South Pacific. So when I went in,

09:40.426 --> 09:45.352
people were not staying in this country very long. 
We went through our boot camp training, which

09:45.392 --> 09:53.122
they'd shortened, and then the period of combat 
conditioning in San Diego.

09:56.086 --> 09:59.350
Our combat conditioning and programs, and then we 
were immediately shipped out to the South

09:59.752 --> 10:03.556
Pacific. I went on a troop ship from San Diego to 
Honolulu and was there about a month in what they

10:03.576 --> 10:28.324
called a replacement depot and then took a little, 
very small Danish freighter that they were using

10:03.576 --> 10:28.324
at the time to carry troops from there to 
Guadalcanal. And I went into Guadalcanal in

10:33.066 --> 10:41.576
about, oh gosh, I forget the dates, but it was 
sometime that summer. Now, the island had already

10:41.596 --> 10:45.341
been secured before I got there. So our only 
activities really were patrols, trying to mop up

10:46.462 --> 10:54.733
the remnants of the Japanese that were still 
there. But the major fighting had already been

10:55.434 --> 10:59.779
completed by the time I got there. We were on 
Guadalcanal for, and I'm not good at dates at all,

11:01.717 --> 11:08.726
but for a period of months. And then went to Guam. 
And they were in the process of retaking Guam then.

11:17.818 --> 11:29.614
Again, I was with a third corps battalion,

11:17.818 --> 11:29.614
in which the first and sixth divisions were the 
major elements. But we were with a specialized

11:31.737 --> 11:36.023
signal group. We were called the Joint Assault and 
Signal Operations. The first, the only real

11:42.772 --> 11:50.462
combat action that I was in was in Okinawa. We were 
in the advanced landing parties on Okinawa. We

11:56.750 --> 11:59.854
went in there, I believe it was Easter Sunday. And 
again, I was still with the 3rd Corps, Special

12:01.572 --> 12:10.105
Signal Battalion with the 3rd Corps. And we were 
the group that were to land with the assault troops

12:10.887 --> 12:26.972
and provide ship-to-shore communications with 
the landing, with the troop ships and with the

12:10.887 --> 12:26.972
support battle ships that were there in support of 
the landings.

12:30.007 --> 12:36.377
I was on Okinawa all the way through until it was 
secured.

12:39.443 --> 12:45.332
And again, the date sort of escaped me, but we left 
Okinawa to go back to Guam again. And we were on an

12:45.372 --> 12:49.199
LST.

12:51.643 --> 12:53.145
And we're still aboard ship. when the atomic bomb 
was dropped on Hiroshima. I think that was about

12:57.871 --> 13:02.517
August, the first part of August, the fourth or 
fifth of August. So all we could do, all we did

13:03.818 --> 13:08.304
really was land back in Guam.

13:12.049 --> 13:17.216
Stayed on shore probably a matter of just a week or 
10 days while we were regrouping. And we were a

13:18.578 --> 13:22.423
group, our group was sent to China to North China 
then, and landed in North China at Tencent as a part

13:22.825 --> 13:36.862
of a force to repatriate the Japanese out of China. 
They had been in China since, oh gosh, the early, I

13:36.882 --> 13:44.090
guess the late 30s, 39 or 40. So our group went in to 
repatriate

13:51.833 --> 14:04.810
As I understood it, the major concern was that once 
the Chinese learned that the war was over and Japan

13:51.833 --> 14:04.810
had surrendered, that they might just kill all the 
Japanese soldiers that were there. So we were to go

14:04.910 --> 14:13.642
up and disarm the Japanese, accept their 
surrender, and then ship them home. I said we

14:13.662 --> 14:20.811
landed in China on September the 1st, and then...

14:22.917 --> 14:26.020
Stayed there, did the repatriation. Stayed there 
until, oh, nearly, well, until June of the next

14:26.500 --> 14:33.006
year. That must be June of 45. So

14:35.128 --> 14:43.935
no,

14:35.128 --> 14:43.935
that'd be June of 46. My years slipped. June of 
1946, I left China to come back to get discharged.

14:53.849 --> 15:00.157
We were, of course, during that time, that was the, 
we got the Japanese out relatively early. But that

15:01.098 --> 15:09.088
was the same time that Miao Tse-tung was coming 
down out of Manchuria on his move south. And Chiang

15:09.969 --> 15:22.084
Kai-shek was supposedly fighting him all the way 
down, being pushed back into north China and

15:09.969 --> 15:22.084
eventually on out through Shanghai. So we were a 
part of the truce teams that the United States sent

15:22.908 --> 15:44.717
to China during that period of late 45 to try to 
minimize the fighting between Chiang Kai-shek

15:22.908 --> 15:44.717
and Mao Tse-Tung.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.342
We were... The two major cities in that part of 
North China were Tencent and Peking. Peking being

15:54.852 --> 15:58.195
the old national capital. And one of our little 
chores was to protect the Peking-Tencent

15:58.215 --> 16:14.410
Railroad, which during this period, and the 
Chinese, the communist nationalists were right

15:58.215 --> 16:14.410
in that area during this period. And the railroad 
got its brunt of the action. They'd attack the

16:19.917 --> 16:29.331
trains and burn the ties and stack up a bunch of the 
ties and put the rails on top and melt them down. It

16:29.372 --> 16:31.675
made it very inconvenient to operate a railroad. 
But it really wasn't a pitch battle sort of thing

16:33.157 --> 16:37.684
during that period.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.630
So that's sort of a brief term. I spent all of the 
time that I was in the Marine Corps in the South

16:45.810 --> 16:56.526
Pacific and China, and very little of it in the 
United States. In fact, I came back, landed, and I

16:56.686 --> 17:00.271
think was discharged within a week. So my tour in 
the service spent in this country, I think, lasted

17:00.391 --> 17:08.924
about two months out of the three years that I was 
in. I wasn't here very long. You were discharged

17:10.866 --> 17:12.008
when? In June, I think, 29th or so of 1946. By how 
much time do you think that the bombing shortened

17:17.946 --> 17:26.176
the war against Japan? Substantially. I'm not a 
military historian, but we were, of course,

17:28.459 --> 17:40.594
getting prepared, and the reason we were going 
back to Guam was that was to be our staging area

17:40.827 --> 17:49.256
regroup and get rearmed and outfitted

17:40.827 --> 17:49.256
supposedly for the attack on the Japanese 
mainland. And it would have been both a very bloody

17:50.738 --> 18:02.231
affair and a very prolonged affair. Because the 
Japanese in the latter stages of the war had

18:02.251 --> 18:07.577
learned how to fight our style.

18:11.219 --> 18:16.387
The campaigns had become progressively more 
costly. Okinawa was a terrific

18:18.130 --> 18:28.125
loss on, of course, both on the Japanese side and on 
ours. It was a very, very bloody campaign. And had

18:31.911 --> 18:38.762
we had to move into the Japanese mainland, they are 
a very tough,

18:39.653 --> 18:46.484
people, and they would have been very hard to 
dislodge through conventional warfare means.

18:47.887 --> 18:58.564
Now, whether some other event might have 
precipitated a surrender or whether they might

18:47.887 --> 18:58.564
have seen the handwriting on the wall and 
surrendered anyway, nobody knows, but... It took

18:58.785 --> 19:01.209
more than one. It took more than one, that's right.

19:06.518 --> 19:14.950
When you got out of the service in 46, what did you do 
then?

19:14.970 --> 19:19.056
This doesn't sound very good from a standpoint of 
A&M's recruiting. But while I was in the Marine

19:20.457 --> 19:27.307
Corps, I grew up with our closest neighbor. He had a 
boy about a year older than I am. He and I went

19:31.353 --> 19:34.337
through high school together, went through the 
Marine Corps together. He was in the 11th.

19:35.493 --> 19:37.355
Marines, which was a field artillery unit. We 
served in the South Pacific and in China together.

19:44.003 --> 19:51.511
And while we were in China, knowing that we were 
going to be discharged, we decided that we were

19:44.003 --> 19:51.511
going home to school when we got back home. So we, of 
course, got to talking about where we would go. We

19:58.099 --> 20:00.842
decided we'd go to the same place. Frankly, we 
weren't very knowledgeable about universities,

20:01.818 --> 20:23.036
having come from a small country community during 
the Depression years, but we had listened to

20:01.818 --> 20:23.036
Southwest Conference football, and we knew about 
Texas A&M, about the University of Texas, and

20:01.818 --> 20:23.036
about TCU. At that time, that was the or just prior 
to that time. Of course, they had Sammy Ball and Kai

20:28.399 --> 20:38.849
Aldrich at TCU, who were very famous football 
players and made quite a name for the school. So it

20:38.869 --> 20:42.573
had narrowed down to those three places. And we 
finally decided that, well, since TCU was a

20:42.693 --> 20:55.905
private school and neither one of us had any money 
at all, that we were going to have to go to one of the

20:42.693 --> 20:55.905
state schools, which was either Texas or A&M. So in 
a 10-cent bar one night, we decided we'd make our

20:58.130 --> 21:05.420
decision. And it came down to flipping a coin. As 
the heads would go to Texas, tails would come to

21:07.362 --> 21:11.428
A&M. And it came up tails. We both came to A&M in the 
fall of 46. And we got discharged about the same

21:17.957 --> 21:19.819
time. He got out a little earlier than I did. But we 
both hitchhiked a ride down here. about 250 miles,

21:25.822 --> 21:37.515
back of a pickup with their sea bags, and entered 
A&M with that big entering class that came in in the

21:25.822 --> 21:37.515
fall of 46, the returning veterans. You didn't 
have to go through the COA program here since you

21:39.338 --> 21:43.502
were a veteran. I didn't have to go through it. They 
had a, well, let me tell you, when we got here, you

21:46.065 --> 21:54.495
probably don't recall, but at the time, this was a 
big influx of, of returning veterans. They didn't

21:56.675 --> 21:58.818
have housing on campus for us. So they put us at the 
old Bryan Air Force Base in the tar paper shacks.

22:07.388 --> 22:11.072
And our ride had left us on campus. We had 
registered and signed up and gone through all of

22:11.133 --> 22:18.561
the enrollment procedures. Then we said, 
naturally, well, now where do we live? And they

22:23.855 --> 22:28.219
said, well, there'll be a truck come by and take you 
to your barracks. It's going to be out at Bryan Air

22:28.279 --> 22:29.981
Force Base. We didn't know where that was. We found 
out it was about 12 miles out of town. We got out

22:34.445 --> 22:41.472
there, and it was the same thing we'd just gotten 
out of, you know, with the military environment,

22:34.445 --> 22:41.472
those old tar paper shacks. And they really were 
tar paper. And we got there late in the afternoon,

22:45.395 --> 22:49.539
about sundown. And we were both ready to check it 
out and go home. Unfortunately, we didn't have any

22:54.618 --> 22:57.961
transportation since we'd hitchhiked down here. 
So we decided that it was really sort of dumb to pick

22:58.842 --> 23:10.853
up our sea bags and try to hitchhike a ride back home 
again that night, so we'd wait until tomorrow.

23:10.873 --> 23:22.583
Well, obviously, all the rest of the fellas got in 
the barracks, and we got to know each other, and by

23:10.873 --> 23:22.583
the next morning, things looked a whole lot 
better, and so we stayed. But we spent the first

23:23.693 --> 23:27.437
year out there, all of the instructions out there. 
Again, now this was in 46, and there was

23:28.879 --> 23:32.383
practically no transportation. In our barracks 
of, I don't remember, 35, 40 people probably in

23:32.403 --> 23:45.879
that one barracks, maybe more, there was one old 
car that one of the fellows had. And that was the

23:45.899 --> 23:50.344
total transportation availability in our 
barracks. And the rest of them were about the same,

23:50.364 --> 23:52.907
very little transportation. which meant if you 
were at Bryan Air Force Base with no

23:53.900 --> 23:58.968
transportation, you were pretty well isolated. 
So we were reasonably well isolated out there for

23:59.328 --> 24:03.154
the first year. Moved back on campus then in 47. 
Lived up at what was called the new dorm area at that

24:08.361 --> 24:12.788
time, the old dorms up at Northgate. I think we were 
in 17.

24:17.655 --> 24:20.019
And stayed there then that year. And then we had the 
program that... If you were returning veteran,

24:23.617 --> 24:31.507
you didn't have to take the first two years of you 
didn't have to take any of the military corps. But

24:31.547 --> 24:45.044
if you wanted to get a commission, you could then go 
into the core in your junior year and go under

24:31.547 --> 24:45.044
contract and become commissioned. Well, I wasn't 
at all sure of what the future military positions

24:47.073 --> 24:50.718
would be. And I knew if we ever had another war, I'd 
already fought one as a private and PFC. And I had

24:57.548 --> 25:05.259
seen that officers

24:57.548 --> 25:05.259
did a whole lot better than enlisted men in the 
service. And if we ever had another one, I was going

25:05.720 --> 25:08.444
to be an officer this time. So I went through the 
core. I joined the core in my junior year was in EVET

25:15.828 --> 25:17.070
Air Force. And we had a veteran battalion. And I 
went through and was commissioned when I

25:22.316 --> 25:34.831
graduated in 1950 in the Air Force as a second 
lieutenant in the Air Force.

25:37.154 --> 25:43.422
Majored in agricultural economics and stayed 
here, then went on to graduate school. after I

25:44.583 --> 25:53.311
graduated, not totally because I had the burning 
desire for additional knowledge, but jobs were

25:44.583 --> 25:53.311
awful scarce. And the assistantship that I had in 
agricultural economics was about as good an offer

25:54.733 --> 26:05.523
as I had from a standpoint of money at that time. It 
was 1950, and jobs were not all that plentiful at

26:05.543 --> 26:09.347
that time.

26:12.310 --> 26:13.611
So you got a master's in this stuff? I got a master's 
in ag economics in what they called their ag

26:14.620 --> 26:39.746
administration option in 1951 and then worked for 
Dr. John McNeely, who was a livestock marketing

26:14.620 --> 26:39.746
specialist in the agricultural economics area. 
I'd worked for him. while I was an undergraduate

26:41.350 --> 26:54.084
and also under my master's, getting my master's, 
and stayed on then working for the station,

26:41.350 --> 26:54.084
experiment station full time until about March of 
1953. We were doing livestock auction studies. We

26:58.628 --> 27:06.076
did efficiency studies, marketing studies of 
livestock auctions, designed new auction

26:58.628 --> 27:06.076
systems, and so forth. Very interesting work.

27:10.679 --> 27:25.700
Had an opportunity to go to New York City with a 
private firm, price forecasting firm, called

27:10.679 --> 27:25.700
Industrial Commodity Corporation.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.965
Left here in March of 53.

27:31.889 --> 27:32.890
Went to New York City. Took my wife and little baby. 
Pulled a trailer up there. When did you marry? Oh, I

27:39.890 --> 27:40.831
got married in 1950. I got married between the time 
that classes were out and graduation in 1950.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.303
Where's your wife from? She was from a little town 
in Menard, which was the next town over from

27:51.323 --> 27:55.027
Junction. I've heard of Menard. Yeah, well, it's 
the suburb of Junction. It's one of the little

27:59.952 --> 28:05.138
towns about the same size as Junction. Okay, then 
you went to New York in 1953, right?

28:13.437 --> 28:18.943
The Industrial Commodity Corporation was a very, 
again, I've been very fortunate. I've had some

28:18.963 --> 28:21.766
very interesting jobs in my life. This was a 
private forecasting firm. It had been founded by

28:26.030 --> 28:43.309
the president of the company, Mr. Jay Carvel Lang, 
who had gotten into the business and developed

28:26.030 --> 28:43.309
some forecasting, crash forecasting 
techniques. and had worked for, had gotten

28:43.880 --> 29:07.208
contracts with Colgate-Palmolive-Pete at that 
time, it was a Colgate company, to do their

28:43.880 --> 29:07.208
inventory control work, as we'd tell them when to 
buy and stock up on the materials used in making

28:43.880 --> 29:07.208
soaps and toothpaste, and when to let the 
inventory go down. It was an expectation of

29:07.268 --> 29:11.153
falling prices in the future. Well, I was hired to 
set up a livestock and livestock product section

29:12.314 --> 29:19.262
since my background was in livestock. We did the 
economic forecast for Time Life Fortune

29:21.324 --> 29:34.979
magazines and then did procurement advice for 
major companies. In my case, I did procurement

29:36.521 --> 29:40.465
work or telling them when to buy or when to sell, 
depending on what kind of company it was. For

29:45.068 --> 30:00.084
example, Armor was one of our clients, Armor 
Packing Company, and we would tell them when to

29:45.068 --> 30:00.084
sell their animal byproducts, particularly 
tallow and lard and hides. And we also were on the

30:00.965 --> 30:05.389
other side of the market with The Trostall 
Tanneries in Indianapolis was another large

30:06.010 --> 30:09.494
client. We'd tell them when to buy ahead on hides 
for their tanning, leather-making industries.

30:19.704 --> 30:32.017
But when we moved to New York,

30:19.704 --> 30:32.017
I was hired by a fellow named John Atkins who was 
originally from Tennessee and had been with the

30:19.704 --> 30:32.017
firm about a year. And they lived out on Long 
Island. Is that ADK or ATK? ATK, Atkins. As a part

30:43.356 --> 30:48.661
of, of course, I told him, you know, I don't know 
anything about New York. I've never been there. I

30:49.582 --> 30:55.909
really didn't have any desire to go to New York and 
didn't know anything about the area. So I asked him

30:55.929 --> 30:58.371
to see if he could locate a house for us. He did in a 
little town of Bellmore.

31:04.177 --> 31:05.278
B-E-L-L-M-O-R-E. Now, Belmore is out on Long 
Island, on the Long Island Railroad. And it's way

31:12.667 --> 31:16.770
out on the island. When we moved there in 53, it was a 
typical little German community. Large oak and

31:24.677 --> 31:31.984
wild cherry trees, a very beautiful little place. 
It was in the midst of a farming area. And if you'll

31:36.089 --> 31:43.939
recall at one time, Long Island potatoes were the 
classic potato, the big potato area. Also

31:44.880 --> 31:48.465
strawberries, a very rich farming area out there. 
It's now covered with houses from shore to shore.

31:53.451 --> 31:56.435
But we lived in this little town. He'd gotten us a 
very nice house. We had no furniture, of course.

32:02.532 --> 32:07.337
The first six months that we lived there, but it's 
gradually accumulated furniture. My wife liked

32:08.058 --> 32:10.100
it very much. It was a very, very nice place. 
Unfortunately, it was a long way from where I

32:14.745 --> 32:20.771
worked in downtown New York City. Our offices were 
at 122 East 42nd Street, which is right in the

32:20.791 --> 32:32.303
middle of downtown New York City. right across 
from the Chrysler Building. It was in a place

32:35.155 --> 32:38.640
called the Shannon Building. It was 
C-H-A-N-N-I-N, I believe. So I would catch the

32:42.706 --> 32:55.586
6.59 train every morning in order to get, or 7 
o'clock train, it was a 6.59 just before 7, to get to

32:42.706 --> 32:55.586
work at 9. So I had about a two-hour commute each way 
every day. And I'd ride the Long Island Railroad

33:01.662 --> 33:07.990
into Times Square. What was the fare on that 
railroad back then? Do you recall? I bought

33:11.734 --> 33:18.443
monthly tickets, monthly pass sort of thing. And 
it was about $30-something, $36 a month, which

33:19.644 --> 33:31.078
meant if you bought a regular ticket, it would be, 
say, a dollar-something each way. which in those

33:31.717 --> 33:35.322
days, and I was making, by the way, when I went 
there, I made $5,000. That was my starting salary,

33:35.723 --> 33:38.426
$5,000 a year. So $2 a day for railroad fare on a 
$5,000 salary is a substantial lick, substantial

33:39.368 --> 33:52.466
cost, in addition to the time required. We'd go 
into time to the Long Island Railroad. We'd go into

33:55.731 --> 33:56.972
Times Square. We'd... get out, walk over, and 
catch the shuttle from Times Square to Grand

33:59.678 --> 34:07.608
Central Station, and then get out and walk to work. 
And masses of people everywhere. I had a very

34:12.394 --> 34:22.126
interesting time getting used to that many 
people, and particularly the crowding on both the

34:12.394 --> 34:22.126
Long Island Railroad and the subways. It was a 
unique experience. Was that same railroad still

34:25.150 --> 34:28.114
running each way there? Yeah, still running. 
probably still with the same equipment. It was old

34:31.682 --> 34:35.849
equipment even then, but they're probably still 
using much of the same equipment. So y'all decided

34:36.110 --> 34:38.293
to move out of Long Island? Then, right, we, after 
being there about two years, we had a, our daughter

34:38.313 --> 34:54.660
was born in New York shortly after we got there, or 
on Long Island, and I woke up One day, with not only

34:55.096 --> 35:00.783
the commute schedule, but I traveled quite a bit. I 
was to see clients out in Indianapolis or Chicago

35:00.863 --> 35:06.771
or all over the country. Since the livestock area, 
most of it was in the Midwest. So I was out of town

35:10.075 --> 35:12.838
quite a bit. And two, I found that

35:14.120 --> 35:24.613
my kids were still asleep every morning when I left 
to go to work. And I didn't get back until after 7 at

35:25.589 --> 35:30.236
night, so oftentimes or later. And oftentimes, 
they were still asleep when I got in. So I wasn't

35:32.979 --> 35:36.144
seeing my family any. And so I decided to move about 
that hour. I was in the frame of mind to be

35:42.673 --> 35:53.088
approached

35:42.673 --> 35:53.088
to move somewhere else. And about that time, the 12 
western states decided that they would set up a

35:56.774 --> 36:17.938
price forecasting operation to serve the feeder 
cattle industry for the 12 western states based in

35:56.774 --> 36:17.938
Denver. So Dr. McNeely, who I'd worked under here 
since What I was doing in New York was developing

36:25.883 --> 36:41.742
price forecasting techniques using, at that 
time, a relatively new tool of regression

36:25.883 --> 36:41.742
analysis, which we'd sort of developed and 
refined to do price forecasting. And I had a good

36:41.802 --> 36:43.685
rationale for it. I asked if I would be interested 
in moving to Denver and being Assistant Director

36:54.588 --> 37:12.448
of the 12th

36:54.588 --> 37:12.448
Regional Livestock Marketing Technical 
Committee, I believe it had a very short name to it,

36:54.588 --> 37:12.448
with a fellow named, who was director, named 
Harold Abel, who was a USDA employee. So we did. In

37:15.492 --> 37:21.979
fact, by that time, I had my salary in New York had 
increased substantially, and I was making about

37:22.651 --> 37:28.279
between $12,000 and $13,000 a year, which is a very 
good salary then. So I took a cut to about $8,000

37:30.182 --> 37:38.333
to move from New York back to Denver. So we moved 
across country again, left there in the spring of

37:38.353 --> 37:44.682
1955. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah.

37:52.925 --> 38:07.360
spring of 55 and moved to Denver and set up the price 
forecasting mechanism for western feeder

37:52.925 --> 38:07.360
cattle. As a part of that, we worked with the 
agricultural experiment stations of each of the

38:08.021 --> 38:16.470
12 western states. At that time, Texas was not a 
member of the western states, so it was always the

38:22.068 --> 38:23.830
12 western states and Texas. The line went down 
just to the west of us, but Texas was in the group.

38:30.178 --> 38:51.163
Again, very interesting arrangement because the 
activity, which was housed in the Federal

38:30.178 --> 38:51.163
Building in Denver, was really funded through 
assessments to each one of the egg experiment

38:30.178 --> 38:51.163
stations. Every state's got its different laws. 
Some of them could put the money in a common pot.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.222
Others couldn't. They had to pay direct, either 
for travel or personnel costs. So we might end up

39:03.432 --> 39:18.214
one month with a paycheck from Utah and the next 
time with one from Wyoming or Montana or Idaho as to

39:03.432 --> 39:18.214
where our money would come from. Each month, but it 
all came out even in the end, but it was very

39:18.447 --> 39:29.618
interesting the way they had to go around and 
accumulate the funds to pay that sort of a program.

39:31.039 --> 39:31.880
Stayed there a year. We like Denver very much. 
Except it stays cold. Too long in the springtime

39:41.269 --> 39:43.751
for our tastes. So in one of the. trips back to 
Texas.

39:51.025 --> 40:00.898
We came back down here to visit people here and 
happened to be in the ag economics department one

39:51.025 --> 40:00.898
day. And Dr. Tim, who was head then, asked me if I 
knew Fred Benson. I told him, no, I really didn't.

40:11.652 --> 40:12.854
He was over here in engineering. He said, well, 
they were starting a new program called the Texas

40:15.299 --> 40:28.719
Transportation Institute and that he was looking 
for someone to head up a new research project that

40:15.299 --> 40:28.719
they had funded for the coming year. So I came over 
and talked to Fred and then to Mr. McDonald, Thomas

40:30.341 --> 40:43.901
McDonald, who was the supposed head of the 
institute at that time. It was sort of a an

40:47.227 --> 40:58.844
arrangement that they brought him down to set it 
up, and he was to be the principal brain trust

40:47.227 --> 40:58.844
behind the institute. But Mr. Benson was actually 
the one doing the actual administration of it. So I

41:07.297 --> 41:08.318
visited with them. We left and went back to Denver. 
And in about a week, I got a letter from them

41:12.607 --> 41:17.313
offering me a job here. Well, I'd taken a 
substantial cut in salary to move from New York to

41:19.035 --> 41:34.834
Denver, and I was offered a job at another cut in 
salary to move back to Texas A&M.

41:36.576 --> 41:39.980
Fred offered me $7,000 a year. At that time, I was 
making about $8,600 in Denver. Well, I knew that

41:45.779 --> 41:51.286
I wasn't going to get much more than that. But I held 
out for a month or so to make it an even $7,200 or $600

41:51.346 --> 41:58.715
a month. And I never did get it. I never could sway 
them for the extra $200. And finally, we moved back

42:02.059 --> 42:09.748
here in April of 56. And I've been here with it ever 
since.

42:17.721 --> 42:19.745
You came in what capacity? What was your exact 
title when you came in 55, 56?

42:26.578 --> 42:29.043
I was associate research economist. Now, one of 
the reasons I came was I wanted to go ahead and

42:29.343 --> 42:32.850
finish a Ph.D.

42:36.492 --> 42:43.924
When I say finished one, I hadn't started it, but I 
wanted, well, I had taken a course or two, but I

42:36.492 --> 42:43.924
hadn't started the formal program. So as a part of 
the negotiations

42:43.944 --> 42:59.869
was the fact that if I came, that I would be allowed 
to take one course a semester, which is now sort of a

42:43.944 --> 42:59.869
standard practice. It wasn't all that standard at 
the time. toward a PhD so that I could get,

43:02.783 --> 43:12.818
accumulate some of my coursework, get most of my 
coursework off and then drop back perhaps to half

43:02.783 --> 43:12.818
time or something and write a dissertation.

43:15.623 --> 43:20.690
Well, I was, my title was Associate Research 
Economist. So, and I was brought down

43:22.373 --> 43:31.727
specifically to head up a research project, what 
they called Customer Requirements in

43:22.373 --> 43:31.727
Transportation. At Mr. McDonald's insistence, 
he had been chief of the Bureau of Public Roads for

43:32.146 --> 43:47.853
34 years and was really considered to be the father 
of transportation in the country at that time. One

43:49.135 --> 43:57.529
of his major concerns were that we were not really 
gearing our transportation systems to the needs

43:49.135 --> 43:57.529
of the users, that we were really more concerned 
with the providers than we were with the users. He

44:03.413 --> 44:08.459
wanted a continuing study of what do the users 
need? What are their requirements for

44:08.539 --> 44:10.721
transportation? And how are these requirements 
being met? And how can then the providers of

44:14.526 --> 44:25.558
transportation more adequately adjust their 
systems to serve the real needs of the users? That

44:27.597 --> 44:42.415
was one of the first studies that was done under our 
cooperative research program with the Highway

44:27.597 --> 44:42.415
Department, which funding came from the Highway 
Department to do that. It was the study number two.

44:45.799 --> 44:48.062
At that time, they called it Research Project 2. 
RP2 was the title of it. And I stayed... Well, we

44:52.407 --> 44:57.013
sort of... need to change tapes

44:58.242 --> 45:26.342
this one on for again my i'm not real good at dates 
but probably two or three years we built and added

44:58.242 --> 45:26.342
some other research projects to it and the time 
that when i came here we were located in this

44:58.242 --> 45:26.342
building but the building was practically vacant 
there were about four or five of us in this

45:27.723 --> 45:29.525
building. And the building didn't look like it 
does now. All of this area was our library. All of

45:37.792 --> 45:47.761
this wing here was a library, which we've since cut 
up, made my office and the office next to it and a

45:37.792 --> 45:47.761
group of offices on the other side. Upstairs, the 
area just above this was a big, what at that time

45:48.521 --> 45:56.008
they called a map room. Now, the idea when they 
created the institute, and creation was through

45:56.950 --> 46:16.142
the efforts of Mr. DeWitt Greer, who was head of the 
highway department, Mr. Gib Gilchrist, who was

45:56.950 --> 46:16.142
chancellor of the system at that time, and Mr. 
McDonald. And their concept was that this would be

46:16.162 --> 46:21.591
a think tank a think tank operation that they'd 
bring Mr. McDonald and they would get a leading man

46:21.790 --> 46:37.352
from each of the disciplines in and they would 
really not have much to do except study and write

46:21.790 --> 46:37.352
and

46:38.935 --> 46:54.633
evaluate policies of transportation and that 
their vision was in order to do this you needed to

46:38.935 --> 46:54.633
have room where you could spread out maps of the 
system and look at the way the systems came

46:38.935 --> 46:54.633
together and what the problems were and this sort 
of thing. It never did work that way. One, there was

46:58.898 --> 47:01.481
no funding available for that sort of thing. So we

47:06.458 --> 47:18.352
rather rapidly shifted over to more of a research 
orientation as opposed to a think tank funded

47:06.458 --> 47:18.352
policy group. And in later years began modifying 
the building to accommodate those different

47:18.373 --> 47:24.480
kinds of needs. The great big rooms, the map rooms, 
and so forth were not functionally useful.

47:32.089 --> 47:35.233
The institute started, as I say, with only a few 
people. It was actually created in 55, September

47:35.737 --> 47:44.071
55, so I was here pretty early on in its life. It was 
created by board minute order and through a

47:44.091 --> 47:56.732
special legislative provision which allowed the 
highway department.
