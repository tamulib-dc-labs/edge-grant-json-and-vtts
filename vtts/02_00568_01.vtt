00:01.432 --> 00:14.849
This is an interview with John Leslin by John 
Walbert on date May 9, 1994, in Rockport, Texas,

00:01.432 --> 00:14.849
concerning the Rural Development... What was it? 
The Rural... What was the official title? Well,

00:18.574 --> 00:20.817
the function is Rural Development. The name of the 
organization is the National Area Development

00:20.837 --> 00:25.683
Institute. The National Area Development 
Institute. And... In interesting and

00:29.950 --> 00:36.918
accumulating knowledge, I'm asking you to donate 
this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral History

00:29.950 --> 00:36.918
Collection in the University Archives. Is this 
all right with you? Yes, of course. Okay, this is so

00:40.021 --> 00:47.370
future historians, students, or researchers can 
listen to it and are free to use any of the

00:40.021 --> 00:47.370
statements in this interview. The thing we'd like 
to start out with is where did rural development

00:48.531 --> 00:53.917
start out? Whose idea was it, and how did you get 
interested in it? Oh, rural development goes back

00:58.165 --> 01:00.568
a long ways. It started out, I've seen literature 
that goes back to the 1800s. And when you think in

01:07.796 --> 01:13.482
terms of the canals that were put in and the roads 
that were put in. So if you talk about rural, and

01:14.603 --> 01:27.177
rural is defined as non-metropolitan or 
non-urban, it's generally speaking areas that

01:14.603 --> 01:27.177
primary activity was either in extraction 
industries or in farming.

01:30.262 --> 01:37.151
But when exactly did you get interested in joining 
any sort of organization or agency to help out

01:30.262 --> 01:37.151
rural communities? I joined the Spinneltop 
Research Organization in Lexington, Kentucky, a

01:38.874 --> 01:51.951
non-profit research entity that was established 
by the Commonwealth of Kentucky to help in the

01:38.874 --> 01:51.951
development of Kentucky. And that was in 63. By 65, 
I was involved in doing studies in Appalachian,

01:58.898 --> 02:13.960
Kentucky, to try to help identify opportunities 
for job creation and opportunities for getting

01:58.898 --> 02:13.960
communities to work together so that they could 
get something done. We use the term scale, access,

02:14.040 --> 02:18.347
and scope. You've got to have enough scale to do 
something, and you have to have enough scope, a

02:18.367 --> 02:25.497
range of activities in order for it to be cohesive. 
And then you can't have everything, so you have to

02:26.759 --> 02:33.049
have access to what you need. For example, in 
Appalachia, you have to have access to the outside

02:33.209 --> 02:36.874
world. The road system was so poor that it was 
isolated. They've been in highways, Appalachian

02:42.002 --> 02:47.991
development highways, and then they had access to 
the real world. And whatever they did produce,

02:48.071 --> 02:53.680
they could get it to the markets. But Really, the 
National Area Development Institute was started

02:54.282 --> 03:17.927
about 1968 as a part of spin-on-top research by 
means of a grant from the Ford Foundation, which

02:54.282 --> 03:17.927
supported us for about five years, along with 
research contracts with half a dozen federal

02:54.282 --> 03:17.927
agencies. How closely did you work with President 
Johnson's Great Society programs to bring

03:19.966 --> 03:27.757
Appalachia into the mainstream of American 
society? I mean, he had read books about the other

03:27.777 --> 03:38.231
America, and he had tried with this Great Society 
program to bring in a lot of the persons who were

03:27.777 --> 03:38.231
below the poverty line. How closely did you work 
with some of the governing agencies under

03:38.251 --> 03:42.817
President Johnson's administration? Well, you 
remember the idea for helping Appalachia

03:49.733 --> 04:14.188
occurred to john kennedy before his 
assassination by virtue of the stopover he made in

03:49.733 --> 04:14.188
west virginia and he saw the conditions there and 
he had no idea things were like that when johnson

03:49.733 --> 04:14.188
took over he had a commitment he made a commitment 
to enacting the legislation that would carry out

03:49.733 --> 04:14.188
the dream that john kennedy had And so it was 
Kennedy's idea, Johnson put it into action. In

04:19.614 --> 04:31.907
1968, if I'm not mistaken, the Economic 
Development Administration was formed, the

04:19.614 --> 04:31.907
Appalachian Rural Development, the Appalachian 
Regional Development Program was started. The

04:32.468 --> 04:42.319
Appalachian Regional Commission, excuse me, as a 
governing body composed of governors of the 13

04:32.468 --> 04:42.319
Appalachian states became active. And that's 
when I got very active in the Appalachian region.

04:47.838 --> 04:53.843
My first study was in the four poorest counties in 
Appalachia, Lee, Wolf, Brethren, and Owsley

04:47.838 --> 04:53.843
counties. And they were so isolated, they hadn't 
joined the 19th century, literally. And it was a

05:00.369 --> 05:12.660
fascinating experience to meet and talk with 
these people, help them discover ways in which

05:00.369 --> 05:12.660
they could do things they'd never thought about 
doing before, as simple as Hey, they could put a

05:13.163 --> 05:15.025
little bakery in town. Instead of buying it from 
Louisville or Lexington, they could make it on and

05:15.646 --> 05:21.713
keep that money in the community. One of the 
fellows suggested there were some caves out there

05:22.795 --> 05:26.599
and some old mines. Maybe they could grow 
mushrooms. And we looked into that for them, and

05:29.022 --> 05:37.973
some five years later, they have a major 
mushroom-producing activity in an old coal mine.

05:39.286 --> 05:48.279
It uses manure from the horse farms in Lexington 
that is shipped in with the empty freight cars that

05:39.286 --> 05:48.279
carry the coal out. See, that's how you get scale, 
scope, and access to bring about something. And in

05:56.090 --> 06:06.525
order to get the scale, you have to, generally 
speaking, involve several political entities in

05:56.090 --> 06:06.525
order to have enough resources, money, and 
manpower, and political power. to get anything

06:07.315 --> 06:12.342
accomplished.

06:12.362 --> 06:14.324
So how did you find out a lot of this? Was it mostly in 
the field interviews or working with probably any

06:14.344 --> 06:29.164
government entities in the local level in 
Kentucky, or pretty much y'all were just on your

06:14.344 --> 06:29.164
own going out and interviewing persons or 
interviewing farmers? How did you find out a lot of

06:29.265 --> 06:31.668
this information? Was it just in the field work 
mostly? Well, let me start by saying that... I had

06:37.420 --> 06:49.996
the good fortune to work with a man who was the 
brains that invented the notion of the

06:37.420 --> 06:49.996
Appalachian Regional Commission and structured 
it, and later became the representative of the

06:37.420 --> 06:49.996
Appalachian governors in Washington to 
administer the program. His name was John

06:50.717 --> 06:51.938
Wissman. And John introduced me to the lore of East 
Kentucky. He was an East Kentucky boy himself, and

06:56.784 --> 07:03.833
the governor who put Spinnletop together was an 
East Kentucky product. And so we had all the access

07:04.910 --> 07:08.073
that we needed. And with regard to getting 
information, there was very little statistical

07:08.974 --> 07:20.607
information that you could go to and had any 
meaning to it because you didn't have it. The

07:21.648 --> 07:27.395
culture was so different that it didn't really 
make sense. But what we did was we talked to people.

07:30.478 --> 07:32.000
We interviewed individuals. We had collective 
meetings by counties. I remember one in

07:35.521 --> 07:41.109
particular in Wolf County. We called a meeting to 
help them, you know, what do you call it,

07:42.371 --> 07:53.608
brainstorm.

07:53.808 --> 07:57.734
How can we create jobs out here? And the people were 
all very polite, and finally this one big man, huge

07:58.235 --> 08:01.680
guy, got up. His name was Mr. Stovall, and he was the 
director of a private school, charity school out

08:02.560 --> 08:06.944
there. He said, Mr. Leslie, we appreciate your 
interest in helping us talk about this sort of

08:07.305 --> 08:15.795
thing, but what we're here for is to find out do we 
plant tomatoes or not this year? And I said, why?

08:17.356 --> 08:31.212
And they had made applications for an EDA grant to 
use some of the wasted energy to have hothouses in

08:17.356 --> 08:31.212
which they could grow tomatoes, but they didn't 
have an adequate marketing structure, so it

08:17.356 --> 08:31.212
didn't get off the ground. So you were continually 
blindsided by that kind of a situation. We went to

08:37.789 --> 08:48.483
one county to see the county judge, and he'd been 
arrested and was in county jail for bootlegging.

08:50.005 --> 09:00.979
So we went to the banker, and I had taken with me a 
young man who was a graduate student at the

08:50.005 --> 09:00.979
University of Kentucky who was raised in that 
area, and his Uncle was a congressman, and the

09:01.330 --> 09:07.078
banker trusted him, and I would ask the banker a 
question. He would look at Wibby Pratt, and Wibby

09:07.158 --> 09:10.783
Pratt would nod his head. He'd turn around and 
answer the question. If Wibby didn't nod his head,

09:12.806 --> 09:15.089
he wouldn't answer the question.

09:18.513 --> 09:28.587
So this was a land of education for me, and nobody in 
those days knew anything really in a structured

09:18.513 --> 09:28.587
way that you could go out and teach rural 
development. And so this gave me the opportunity

09:29.275 --> 09:35.641
to just have to start at ground zero with everybody 
else. I had no academic background for this,

09:35.782 --> 09:40.486
because at that time, there was no academic 
training available. So you just used common

09:41.187 --> 09:45.231
sense, put things together, and tried them out. If 
it worked, you remembered it. Ultimately, we put

09:47.213 --> 09:58.084
on some 13 national rural development leader 
schools under the auspices of the Rural

09:47.213 --> 09:58.084
Development Service of the Department of 
Agriculture across the nation. about 100

09:58.840 --> 10:09.416
leaders, rural leaders in each class, so that they 
could learn how to achieve the scale, scope, and

09:58.840 --> 10:09.416
access that is necessary to make something work.

10:13.101 --> 10:23.818
Was there a particular position title that you 
held during this time, or was it pretty much you

10:13.101 --> 10:23.818
were the director of this whole geographic area, 
or how did that work? Well, I'm talking Spindletop

10:23.838 --> 10:27.463
Research and NAIDI, together because they were 
together initially. Ultimately, NAIDI was spun

10:32.025 --> 10:37.032
off from Spindletop Research. At Spindletop 
Research, by the time I left there, I was vice

10:37.132 --> 10:47.147
president of Spindletop Research and secretary 
of the National Area Development Institute. When

10:47.167 --> 10:54.177
we split it off, I became president of the National 
Area Development Institute, headquartered in

10:47.167 --> 10:54.177
Lexington, Kentucky. Ultimately, we moved it to 
Rockport, Texas, and it was a nonprofit

10:54.848 --> 11:01.816
organization. It was not a member of any 
government or ties. It did research work for, oh,

11:04.779 --> 11:18.375
golly, agencies in the federal government, USDA, 
Economic Development Administration,

11:04.779 --> 11:18.375
Environmental Protection Agency, Department of 
Transportation. National Academy of Science,

11:18.963 --> 11:27.451
the Appalachian Regional Commission, the 
Department of Defense, Library of Congress,

11:18.963 --> 11:27.451
Congressional Research Service, Office of 
Economic Opportunity. We did research projects

11:28.092 --> 11:40.925
for all of those federal agencies to help educate 
them that their request, and they paid for it, to

11:28.092 --> 11:40.925
come to grips with the rural thing. Everybody knew 
about the urban mess, but they didn't And really,

11:44.731 --> 11:59.570
that was the primary reason for establishing the 
Nice Marietta Institute with Ford Foundation

11:44.731 --> 11:59.570
support, because the Urban Institute was a mature 
organization, and the rural areas had no

11:44.731 --> 11:59.570
counterpart organization. And so you weren't 
getting a balanced treatment.

12:04.817 --> 12:06.900
How long did this work in Kentucky? Is it still 
going on today? Or pretty much, was there a time

12:08.381 --> 12:12.747
frame that most of this stayed on? It varies all 
over the country. Kentucky has gone through all

12:17.111 --> 12:21.415
sorts of gyrations. John Wiseman lives in 
Kentucky, and he's consulted with all the

12:21.455 --> 12:29.743
governors since those days and is currently 
working with the governor. The area development

12:29.804 --> 12:41.755
districts, multi-county organizations that 
were established in Kentucky are still existent

12:29.804 --> 12:41.755
and still active. And incidentally, at NAIDAC, we 
did the initial development programs for each of

12:42.207 --> 12:58.767
those sub-state districts, area development 
districts, in conjunction with the people out in

12:42.207 --> 12:58.767
the field, through this interview, getting them 
involved. Because the one thing you learn in real

12:58.867 --> 13:05.675
development, you can come in with the best idea in 
the world and ain't nobody going to buy it. What you

13:05.695 --> 13:11.202
got to do is have them come up with it and have 
somebody emotionally committed to it, and then it

13:05.695 --> 13:11.202
will work. Where else has this worked? Have you 
worked with it in any area besides Kentucky or

13:16.895 --> 13:21.520
since then? I was a consultant to the Rural 
Development Service at the Department of

13:22.961 --> 13:29.028
Agriculture for a number of years, hired through 
NAIDAC. And that's where we conceived and put on

13:30.129 --> 13:36.035
these schools for the department. And we covered 
the United States and Hawaii. in the

13:41.911 --> 13:52.426
administration of Jimmy Carter, we promoted the 
use of state rural development committees in all

13:41.911 --> 13:52.426
fifty states. I went around the country talking to 
governors and talking to people in the rural

13:54.428 --> 14:01.739
development business, showing them how this 
could work. There was a series of goals that Carter

14:02.660 --> 14:11.412
had promulgated, and then we reported and pushed 
pull to get that going. When Carter left and Reagan

14:14.042 --> 14:20.108
came in, things slowed down. Ultimately, in 1986, 
the Rural Development Service, or Office of Rural

14:21.109 --> 14:35.262
Development Policy—it had several names—was

14:21.109 --> 14:35.262
unfunded, and it all went out of existence. I left 
there at that time. By that time, I had joined the

14:40.163 --> 14:43.827
Office of Rural Development Policy, a senior 
policy coordination officer. And just, I

14:44.988 --> 14:49.573
retired. What are some of the lasting ideas and 
projects that you came up with there? I mean, was

14:55.739 --> 15:08.652
there any sort of thing where you'd gone into 
schools and tried to promote, instead of the focus

14:55.739 --> 15:08.652
going directly into preparing for college, were 
there any sort of vocational trainings for

14:55.739 --> 15:08.652
schools that the... R-A-D-I had really looked 
into? Well, early on, while it's been on top of

15:13.300 --> 15:29.304
research, I did a study that's been called seminal 
in developing the curriculum for a post-high

15:13.300 --> 15:29.304
school vocational program, two-year program, in 
central Kentucky for 17 counties. And that school

15:29.324 --> 15:31.006
is still going. It took them about 10 years to get it 
implemented. And the reason for that was They

15:36.830 --> 15:44.138
didn't have the teachers who knew how to teach what 
needed to be taught, and you couldn't just fire the

15:36.830 --> 15:44.138
ones who were teaching what they were teaching. 
You had to wait until they retired, so you couldn't

15:44.158 --> 15:47.162
do it. Oh, I think one of the most memorable things 
is I worked with a joint executive

15:49.985 --> 16:05.402
branch—chaired, as a matter of fact—committee, 
executive branch, House of Representatives, and

15:49.985 --> 16:05.402
the Senate rewrite the Rural Development Act of 
1972, get rid of five onerous reports that nobody

16:06.310 --> 16:18.051
wanted, didn't read, and the paper wasn't 
anything too good for an outhouse even. It was a

16:18.773 --> 16:25.044
significant event, and it was a lot of fun working 
on that. What are some of the lasting results that

16:25.064 --> 16:28.791
you see? school there, but what are the other big 
results that you really, when you look back at it,

16:29.092 --> 16:39.504
you can say, hey, that was great to be a part of, and 
boy, that was neat that that's happened, and it

16:29.092 --> 16:39.504
really made a difference. What is probably the 
biggest three things you're most proud of? Well,

16:44.330 --> 16:50.136
you know, rural development is small scale, so 
there are never any major things. I felt good about

16:50.236 --> 16:55.803
seeing that mushroom production facility go in. 
The Appalachian Highway system which we

16:58.235 --> 17:16.595
developed a new technique for locating the route 
of the Appalachian highway system on the basis of

16:58.235 --> 17:16.595
what were the developmental opportunities 
rather than what's the cheapest and shortest

16:58.235 --> 17:16.595
distance, because the object was to open it up and 
make it productive. Highway engineers just don't

17:16.815 --> 17:19.438
think that way. We were successful in routing all 
the major highways through Appalachia for

17:26.264 --> 17:29.428
maximum developmental potential. And it turned 
central Appalachia around, and it is better off

17:29.448 --> 17:41.321
today significantly than it was in the 60s and 70s. 
So those are typical. And I felt good about these

17:44.645 --> 17:47.489
National Rural Development Leaders Schools. It 
changed people's lives. They would come in and

17:49.170 --> 17:54.837
say, boy, that was an experience, and I've changed 
my occupation. I'm involved in this community

17:55.340 --> 18:01.488
development stuff, and it all goes back to taking 
that course. This was a five-day course, ten to

18:01.508 --> 18:06.155
twelve hours a day. We believed in marathon 
training and a combination of lectures and a work

18:07.456 --> 18:16.849
project using a case study approach. So people got 
so involved, and they really did have that, aha, I

18:17.069 --> 18:24.199
see. And that makes an educator feel good when they 
finally say, oh, that's what you're talking

18:24.398 --> 18:30.205
about. That makes sense. And what background were 
you able to draw upon this? Where were you

18:35.352 --> 18:39.076
originally from and where was your education at? 
Did it really apply to what you were doing there? I

18:43.462 --> 18:51.992
got a degree in electrical engineering from the 
University of Texas in 1948, 47 or 48.

18:52.900 --> 18:57.225
and went to work with the General Electric Company 
in the Knowles Atomic Power Laboratory. It

18:58.347 --> 19:07.037
doesn't have much to do with rural development, 
but my assignment was in employee relations,

18:58.347 --> 19:07.037
management development, communications, 
training. I developed a graduate education

19:08.339 --> 19:17.710
program in conjunction with RPI, Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute, leading to a master's

19:08.339 --> 19:17.710
degree in nuclear engineering. which was a 
seminal event. The schools were behind. They had

19:22.984 --> 19:26.650
to learn from the industry what was going on. And, 
you know, rural development is not complicated.

19:32.418 --> 19:35.343
It's pretty simple, and it's common sense. And 
once you see that you've got to get a lot of people

19:35.503 --> 19:44.476
together and find ways for them to get behind 
something, and there's no simple way to do it. It's

19:44.576 --> 19:44.997
just the learning that you got to give credit to get 
credit and you got to give credit to get action it

19:45.668 --> 20:09.769
can't be your idea it's got to be their idea and you 
learn a few of those simple things and the process

19:45.668 --> 20:09.769
you start out by finding out what are the assets of 
this area what do they got that they could might

19:45.668 --> 20:09.769
make some use of and what are the interests of 
people there and then when you What are the

20:10.762 --> 20:15.870
opportunities to value add to agricultural 
products? Don't just cut the beans down, can them

20:15.890 --> 20:19.676
and process them there. When you catch the fish, 
process the fish. And that has gone on all across

20:23.523 --> 20:28.070
the United States. Small companies, now that we 
have transportation systems the way they are,

20:29.592 --> 20:36.263
Montana, for example, is a delightful place to 
live. And many high-technical outfits are

20:36.850 --> 20:44.778
located in Montana because they like it. And with 
Overnight Federal Express, they can compete with

20:44.798 --> 20:51.685
anybody. Their living costs are less, and they're 
living in a lifestyle they want to live. So rural

20:56.631 --> 20:59.954
areas offer a lot. On the other hand, if you want the 
excitement of a major metropolitan area, dodge

21:04.171 --> 21:17.860
bullets every night when you're coming home, 
while you can stay in these big cities and have your

21:04.171 --> 21:17.860
doors all locked up and live a scared-to-death 
life, which is not very appealing to some people.

21:19.257 --> 21:24.181
In Texas, we've got an extensive farm-to-market 
road system for its agriculture products. We've

21:24.201 --> 21:36.232
got a very active agriculture commissioner 
presently, Rick Perry, who's with the new North

21:24.201 --> 21:36.232
American Free Trade Agreement, is really pushing 
Texas agricultural products to Mexico since they

21:24.201 --> 21:36.232
are our biggest trading partner. Now that you've 
retired and are now in Texas, do you see a lot of the

21:36.753 --> 21:48.623
goals that you looked at trying to implement in 
this 1960s in Kentucky, did you see these goals?

21:49.008 --> 21:53.333
that you looked at, are they pretty much 
paralleled and been made here in Texas? I've

21:54.996 --> 22:00.242
really not gotten close to what goes on in Texas, 
I'm ashamed to say. It seems like it's always

22:00.883 --> 22:06.550
you're an expert when you get 200 miles away rather 
than when you're there. And I get involved in the

22:08.012 --> 22:13.499
local community here. I started a Good Samaritan 
organization for emergency assistance to the

22:14.540 --> 22:18.525
poor and using the principles that we taught in 
rural development. And the community just bought

22:23.044 --> 22:24.606
it. It was their idea, and I just got them together 
and talked and wore them out until they decided to

22:25.487 --> 22:32.395
do something, and it worked. So Texas' worst roads 
are better than most states' good roads when you

22:32.415 --> 22:42.787
get away from the interstate system. But Texas has 
the finest road system in the world. in my opinion.

22:50.794 --> 22:53.619
It doesn't have access problems except for 
distance. When you're trying to get to El Paso, I

22:53.739 --> 22:58.428
don't care how good the road is, it's a long ways. 
Recent trends in agriculture that I've been

23:00.832 --> 23:07.885
seeing in Texas through being at Texas A&M It's 
tending to go more towards genetically altered

23:08.303 --> 23:21.578
vegetables, and so you have a juicier, bigger 
tomato than, you know, we have the 10-15 onion and a

23:08.303 --> 23:21.578
lot of these real kind of fancy technological 
advances. Did the University of Kentucky ever

23:21.938 --> 23:30.548
really present something like this to your 
research when y'all were working, to these

23:21.938 --> 23:30.548
small... places in Appalachia, did they come in 
and say, hey, you know, we've got this idea and this

23:30.933 --> 23:38.243
new crop, and we want to really have a testing 
ground. Do you all want to try this? Well, most of

23:40.987 --> 23:59.573
that activity was done by the Extension Service, 
and that is quite dependent

23:40.987 --> 23:59.573
on the interest and the expertise of the Extension 
agent that is responsible for an area, and some of

23:40.987 --> 23:59.573
them have been very aggressive in in promoting the 
latest ways to

24:00.076 --> 24:10.930
produce and process agricultural products. By 
and large, the Rural Development Service, NAIDI,

24:12.753 --> 24:27.692
were concerned primarily with non-agricultural 
activities because the agriculture thing goes on

24:12.753 --> 24:27.692
its own pretty well. It was the absence of of 
economic activity that was killing them because

24:30.198 --> 24:41.049
the efficiency of agriculture production has 
gone up so high now that its employment base is very

24:30.198 --> 24:41.049
low. And if you're looking for employment, you 
really have to look at processing or something

24:41.830 --> 24:51.040
like that, not genetic devices. What you're going 
to find out there is it's going to cause less

24:51.781 --> 24:59.749
employment because it's easier to produce and you 
get a higher yield. for the same amount of labor,

25:00.269 --> 25:03.154
and so you're market dependent. You see what I 
mean? I noticed looking at some of the great

25:06.299 --> 25:20.923
society agencies that started and some of the New 
Deal policies that continued on, there was the

25:06.299 --> 25:20.923
Rural Electric Council, which had provided 
electricity to rural Americans. And a lot of

25:21.745 --> 25:26.833
places, at least in Texas, have formed electric 
cooperatives to provide electricity to run some

25:27.134 --> 25:30.739
of the local rural businesses. Was this a big 
factor in some of the Appalachian areas, trying to

25:31.941 --> 25:44.338
get some of the government or try to get the people 
to form an electric cooperative to get everyone

25:31.941 --> 25:44.338
power, or did pretty much everyone have it, or what 
were their thoughts on it? The Real Electric

25:46.081 --> 25:52.250
Administration has been very active in real 
development since its inception. And The real

25:54.944 --> 26:13.583
problem that they face now is there are a lot of 
people who feel it's not fair that rural electrics

25:54.944 --> 26:13.583
can loan money at a lower rate and therefore, in a 
sense, be subsidized while other power companies

25:54.944 --> 26:13.583
can't. Now, once the system was built, the 
maintenance problems aren't as expensive as they

26:14.364 --> 26:20.530
were when it was first put in. My wife was raised out 
in west Texas on a ranch, and they didn't get

26:20.999 --> 26:27.805
electricity until the mid-50s. Had it not been for 
REA, they still wouldn't have electricity. It's

26:31.729 --> 26:32.930
impossible. You just really can't quantify that 
in any isolated area, which west Texas is isolated

26:32.950 --> 26:48.964
by distance, and Appalachia by the wrinkled 
mountains and the terrain. And so wherever there

26:49.855 --> 27:00.256
was a problem that made provision of electric 
current not economical going the private way,

26:49.855 --> 27:00.256
this is the only way they could do it. But that need 
is really not as much as it is, and there's been a

27:00.798 --> 27:11.239
constant force in Congress to reduce the subsidy 
that goes in that direction. You mentioned that

27:12.485 --> 27:14.026
you retired in 1986. And what have you seen since 
then, since the organizations you work with that

27:15.348 --> 27:20.553
pretty much remain unfunded? And what has the 
organization done since your retirement? Or has

27:23.796 --> 27:25.818
it pretty much ceased to exist? And has any other 
organization picked up the slack where you all

27:25.858 --> 27:29.041
left off? Well, I retired, but that doesn't mean 
I've quit working. I've been a consultant to the

27:34.305 --> 27:39.150
Future Farmers of America, where we developed for 
them several programs. And the major program that

27:39.890 --> 27:45.755
we worked with them on was their community 
development program. They had chapters from all

27:46.736 --> 27:55.363
over the United States compete for community 
development or area development or rural

27:46.736 --> 27:55.363
development, whatever you want to call it. And 
they had some projects that you wouldn't believe

27:55.864 --> 27:59.747
that they got started in rural areas. 
Traditionally, Future Farms of America has been

28:00.307 --> 28:09.475
just agricultural and stock shows and that sort of 
thing and agricultural products. They brought it

28:10.450 --> 28:27.930
into the fold of something that they could get 
involved in the community with, and they ran

28:10.450 --> 28:27.930
tractor safety programs that we designed for 
them, a double line for safety for use of seat belts

28:10.450 --> 28:27.930
and not drinking while driving. Programs were 
promulgated, all in the sense of community

28:29.132 --> 28:36.060
development in the future parts of America. The 
National Association of State Development

28:39.020 --> 29:05.702
agencies nasdaq they call it i've consulted with 
them most recently in montana helping the

28:39.020 --> 29:05.702
governor of montana put on town meetings in 11 
cities in montana which was an exciting

28:39.020 --> 29:05.702
experience it was again just people to people 
getting their views finding where there was

28:39.020 --> 29:05.702
consensus seeing how to build on the consensus and 
move on from there it's rarely a a big announcement

29:06.475 --> 29:09.518
that the world has suddenly got better. It's a lot 
of little bitty things where things improve. And

29:14.342 --> 29:23.169
you look back 10 years later and say, boy, I don't 
know whether you want to call it improved or not,

29:14.342 --> 29:23.169
but when we moved to Rockport in 1975, there was one 
traffic light in town. Now we have 11. You're going

29:26.652 --> 29:32.998
to vary as to whether the old timers don't think 
that's much improvement

29:26.652 --> 29:32.998
there. But now we're going to bypass around the 
town. we can get rid of our stoplights. You

29:39.726 --> 29:46.434
mentioned with the safety and then the traffic 
lights, some of the results here, but what were the

29:39.726 --> 29:46.434
goals that you looked at? Nate, what were the goals 
that you looked at? I mean, all the other, the hard

29:49.738 --> 29:54.603
work really notwithstanding, what were the goals 
that you were working for? What was the ideal

29:54.663 --> 29:57.667
result? Basically, it was to make our rural areas a 
better place to work, live, play, and pray. In

30:05.858 --> 30:08.162
other words, the quality of life is your goal. Why 
should the rural people have a lousy quality of

30:08.763 --> 30:11.347
life? And so I think the quality of life has 
improved considerably throughout the United

30:12.488 --> 30:32.119
States in rural areas, perhaps at a faster rate 
than in the cities, given their current

30:12.488 --> 30:32.119
propensity to crime and the underclass 
development and some almost intractable

30:33.517 --> 30:34.138
problems. Matter of fact, the thing that 
interested me the most and got me involved in rural

30:34.518 --> 30:45.992
development was we operated on a scale where you 
could make something happen and you could study

30:34.518 --> 30:45.992
the problem. When you try to do the same thing in New 
York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, that's

30:46.012 --> 30:55.764
breaking it down to neighborhoods. In rural 
areas, we put things together to build it up enough

30:55.784 --> 30:59.548
to have enough scale. In metropolitan areas, 
they've got to break it down to get it to enough

31:04.027 --> 31:07.750
scale that you can even fool with it. And then 
there's so many interacting forces that you don't

31:07.770 --> 31:11.293
have in the rural setting. So it's a lot tougher to 
solve those urban problems than it is the rural

31:11.734 --> 31:15.977
problems. They have their problems, but I'll take 
those any day over the metropolitan area. Well, I

31:21.262 --> 31:24.925
think that pretty much concludes the interview. 
Is there anything else you'd like to leave future

31:24.945 --> 31:32.852
researchers, students, and listeners to this 
interview, leave them with about rural

31:24.945 --> 31:32.852
development? Well, I guess if a guy with as little 
formal training as I had, and

31:34.267 --> 31:50.228
I didn't realize this at the time, but I just had a 
tremendous opportunity to learn. And I learned

31:51.129 --> 31:52.952
from so many people. I didn't learn how to do a 
regression analysis, but I never had to do one. I

31:59.140 --> 32:03.025
had people that worked for me who could do a 
regression analysis. so many things in life where

32:03.646 --> 32:25.102
you need the technical knowledge, but there are 
other things you need, some other kind of skills to

32:03.646 --> 32:25.102
put the technical knowledge to work, to get people 
to work together on it, so that two brains are

32:03.646 --> 32:25.102
better than one, maybe equivalent to three. You 
know, you're not limited by the zero-sums game in

32:27.338 --> 32:29.100
development. You always increase the size of the 
pie rather than define how you divide it, which

32:29.160 --> 32:40.175
traditional economic models apply. I don't know 
whether you remember Leon Tiff or not, the guy who

32:40.195 --> 32:44.942
invented input-output models. Well, I 
participated on a panel he chaired in the Senate

32:46.243 --> 32:57.278
for a hearing, and everybody up there except me had 
Ph.D.s in economics. But I raised questions. If

33:00.680 --> 33:07.690
the data is no good, you can model all you want to, 
and we have a data problem. I made a talk once to the

33:09.412 --> 33:11.715
National Society. I can't remember the name of it.

33:18.123 --> 33:27.636
These systems people

33:18.123 --> 33:27.636
reported that the 1970 census showed that 72 
people commuted daily to Hawaii from Los Angeles

33:28.342 --> 33:33.711
by automobile. How do you do that? Data error.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.713
Displace concreteness. When you see numbers on a 
page, it gives them some validity. It's a rare

33:51.181 --> 33:54.366
person who likes to deal with getting the data, 
because then they're aware of the soft spots in the

33:54.768 --> 33:58.812
data. But if they take somebody else's data, well, 
that's fine. Those are hard numbers. Two is two and

34:04.738 --> 34:07.421
three is three. So, you know, it's a tough one. But 
anyway, this Lintef guy was quite interesting,

34:10.204 --> 34:18.733
and he spent more time talking to me than he did to 
any of the people after it was over. Because he

34:19.253 --> 34:23.158
said, I don't ever get the people who are as close to 
the problem as you are. You know, we in the ivory

34:23.178 --> 34:34.892
towers

34:23.178 --> 34:34.892
just don't have the opportunity to get their hands 
on it and trying to quantify things. So I think that

34:34.912 --> 34:40.659
was an insight worth having. Thank you, Mr. 
Leslie. Well, thank you, John. Good luck to you.
