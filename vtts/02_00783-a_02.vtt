WEBVTT

00:03.080 --> 00:06.260
came out of our productivity program. The 
industrial engineering department is now

00:06.240 --> 00:12.260
involved in an Air Force effort to set up an 
artificial intelligence program. And a

00:16.420 --> 00:24.980
lot of the advanced manufacturing system work 
that is currently being done by Dr. Don Phillips

00:24.960 --> 00:31.010
and others in industrial engineering had its 
roots in the productivity program. And so,

00:33.990 --> 00:40.010
although it does not exist as such now, it laid the 
foundation for some activities

00:39.990 --> 00:46.790
in our program. And incidentally, here again, the 
only reason that that thing succeeded was that Mr.

00:53.660 --> 01:04.000
Gunson and Mr. Whitmore gave me a chunk of TEE's 
money with which to promote

00:53.660 --> 01:04.000
it. That's the only thing we did. If I can tell you 
just a quick story. About that time, Dr. Ray

01:11.200 --> 01:16.660
Goforth, who at that time was in industrial 
engineering, but now is in industrial

01:16.640 --> 01:24.580
engineering. One summer, using TEE's money, we 
pursued this problem of why weren't numerically

01:32.050 --> 01:37.070
controlled machines showing up, particularly in 
what we call the mom and pop machine shops, the

01:37.050 --> 01:42.070
little job shops. But again, and

01:42.050 --> 01:51.120
don't misunderstand, they're not always just, 
you know, real small operations, some of those

01:52.100 --> 01:55.120
things. And

01:55.100 --> 02:06.050
so, with TEE's money, we did a study of the barriers 
to the utilization of numerically controlled

02:06.030 --> 02:10.050
machines in small shops. It turned out to have been 
a mere classic. And

02:13.170 --> 02:26.500
gave us credibility,

02:13.170 --> 02:26.500
research activities, research sponsorship. And 
so, and this is again, you see, the thing that you

02:27.210 --> 02:32.230
have to do. You can't take an outfit that has no 
track record in a given area and go to a sponsor and

02:39.460 --> 02:43.660
say, here, give me some money to do some work in that 
area. He's going to say, well, what the hell have

02:43.640 --> 02:46.660
you done? And quite improperly so. And if you say, 
well, nothing, but if you give us some money, we're

02:51.640 --> 02:53.660
going to do something great. That ain't going to 
get it. And so,

02:58.030 --> 03:07.440
the money that we got from the National Science 
Foundation came out of a, really came out of that

03:07.420 --> 03:17.680
little study that Greg wrote for us in the summer of 
1776. And

03:17.660 --> 03:29.260
it led to an exchange that I had with a guy from the 
National Science Foundation because they had a

03:29.240 --> 03:32.260
productivity program. The

03:32.240 --> 03:48.190
interesting thing that came out of our study was 
because they were afraid of it. They didn't

03:48.170 --> 03:50.190
understand it. They didn't understand what these 
devices could do for them. And they were afraid of

03:54.170 --> 03:56.190
it. They were afraid of what they might do to them. 
And that, and Ray's work that summer, and he had a

03:59.860 --> 04:07.950
couple of students work with him, I thought was 
magnificent. And it brought that,

04:10.720 --> 04:20.540
as it so happened, I went to a meeting sponsored by 
the National Science Foundation dealing with

04:20.520 --> 04:26.400
productivity matters, and they got into this very 
issue. Their view, traditional Bank of the

04:26.380 --> 04:33.400
Potomac's myopia, was that it all rested on money. 
If these people just had money, they would go buy

04:35.380 --> 04:39.400
these machines and use them and so forth. It was 
obvious that the people in Houston, I mean, most of

04:44.560 --> 04:47.580
them tied to the petrochemical industry, making 
machine parts for them, they were laughing all the

04:49.560 --> 04:51.920
way at the bank. I mean, money, money was anything 
but a problem. And so, as a matter of fact, in this

04:54.900 --> 05:00.130
public meeting up in Rochester, New York, I got 
into a rather heated discussion with this guy. And

05:03.110 --> 05:10.910
so,

05:03.110 --> 05:10.910
you know, I voted. We got data to dispute that. He 
said, I want to see that. And so he did see it, and

05:16.400 --> 05:25.370
that led to, well, it led to a lot of it. We 
eventually got involved in the Air Force's

05:25.350 --> 05:38.830
HICAM program.

05:38.810 --> 05:42.830
Because of this little rigging study that we had 
done, we're sort of nationally recognized

05:42.810 --> 05:47.830
experts on technology transfer. But it's just an 
indication, again, of the power of just a little

05:47.810 --> 05:55.050
bit of tease winning. And again, if it hadn't been 
there, we wouldn't have done anything. Let's go

05:59.530 --> 06:03.050
back to the flight land. Oh, okay. Bond Farley. 
Yeah, okay, back to the 60s land. Of

06:11.020 --> 06:22.350
course, I had, when I came here in 64, having been 
involved in hypersonic, and I don't think, you

06:26.090 --> 06:35.240
know, at that time, we couldn't foresee that as 
soon as the Apollo had been successful, that

06:40.800 --> 06:51.890
investing

06:40.800 --> 06:51.890
in space-type research was a heck of a good thing to 
do. So,

06:51.870 --> 07:08.430
so I was, and

06:51.870 --> 07:08.430
I was, I was primarily an experimentalist. I 
hadn't

07:08.410 --> 07:18.260
done a lot of theoretical work. Of course, we 
didn't have a hypersonic facility here. And so it

07:22.240 --> 07:27.830
seemed as though that the most inexpensive 
facility that would, for very, very short

07:27.810 --> 07:38.110
periods, would

07:38.090 --> 07:46.570
create a very high-pressure shock wave which 
rushes down

07:46.550 --> 07:56.550
behind it, with it, at very high speeds. And

07:56.530 --> 08:05.360
back in those days, of course, we were, you know, 
because

08:05.340 --> 08:19.940
aerodynamics

08:05.340 --> 08:19.940
was, was in a completely new realm. There is 
nitrogen and oxygen atomic molecules,

08:19.920 --> 08:26.360
principally. Well, those molecules, in addition 
to bouncing off one another like billiard balls,

08:31.340 --> 08:34.580
they, they, they, they molecule, the individual 
atoms

08:34.560 --> 08:47.260
in the molecule and put them together. But when you 
talk about a re-entry theory, you know, whistling

08:50.360 --> 08:55.050
back into the atmosphere at very, very high 
speeds, it has a shock wave in it. There's a

08:57.080 --> 09:04.220
temperature

08:57.080 --> 09:04.220
jump across any shock wave, even

09:04.200 --> 09:11.900
though it might be, you know, and, but when you talk 
about Mach here, about 20, the temperature jump is

09:16.100 --> 09:20.120
so great that it causes those molecules, those 
atoms to, causes the molecules to dissociate. And

09:24.250 --> 09:27.360
so you have a chemical reaction. The M2 becomes 2N. 
And the same thing for oxygen. So this air, or this

09:32.340 --> 09:36.380
gas, behind the shock wave is no longer air. It's, 
it's, it's some weird new gas. And the fact that

09:42.360 --> 09:45.380
that structure has changed makes it, made it very 
difficult to predict the lift of things like the

09:51.280 --> 09:55.080
Mercury capsule. If you recall the early Mercury 
flights, some

09:57.060 --> 10:11.690
of them, the guy landed miles from the touchdown 
point. And the principal reason there was, of

10:14.720 --> 10:16.740
course he was, he was flying it, but

10:16.720 --> 10:27.250
nonetheless, our, our inability to predict lift 
and drag was very great. Largely because we just

10:29.640 --> 10:34.670
didn't understand this strange new, the 
ionization blackout. The temperatures were so

10:36.650 --> 10:39.980
high that, that electrons would peel off of these 
atoms and create this sheath of ions behind it.

10:46.780 --> 10:53.690
And, and the radio wave wouldn't penetrate it.

10:53.670 --> 11:00.900
So all of that stuff at that time was way out stuff. 
And so shock tubes could, create shock waves

11:02.880 --> 11:11.140
strong enough.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.141
And so again, it was

11:12.120 --> 11:37.620
the

11:12.120 --> 11:37.620
foundation for some research work. So the

11:37.600 --> 11:51.040
shock tube lab, and we got a bit, we had a building 
given to us out at the Annex. And then

11:56.230 --> 12:07.380
too, we had another

12:07.360 --> 12:17.570
stranger.

12:17.550 --> 12:22.990
Some students came to me and said,

12:22.970 --> 12:24.990
the traditional areas, the specialization 
within aerodynamics, and that sort

12:31.800 --> 12:45.710
of

12:31.800 --> 12:45.710
thing.

12:45.690 --> 12:48.310
But the fourth area is flight mechanics, which, 
which deals with the entire vehicle. And it deals

12:52.320 --> 12:54.340
with stability, and control, and that sort of 
thing. And so, some students came to me and said,

13:03.300 --> 13:19.040
look, here

13:03.300 --> 13:19.040
we were,

13:19.020 --> 13:25.610
with a beautiful facility,

13:25.590 --> 13:29.750
with parallel 7,500 foot runway. And at that time 
we had horses. I,

13:31.730 --> 13:46.790
to me,

13:46.770 --> 13:55.060
I think the saddest thing,

13:55.040 --> 13:56.061
is a relic, you know, that's just uncared for, 
sitting in the corner of an airport, or in a hangar,

14:03.040 --> 14:07.960
just,

14:03.040 --> 14:07.960
you know, falling. You know, think that at one 
time, it was a beautiful sight, in flight. There it

14:17.396 --> 14:17.680
sits, rusting, and deteriorating. The second 
saddest thing, I think, is an abandoned airport.

14:23.960 --> 14:24.981
You can imagine that all the time, you know, great 
and wonderful things have happened in the past.

14:29.070 --> 14:30.091
People learning to fly. Now it's just a, a cow 
pasture, or, in that case, a horse pasture. And,

14:37.200 --> 14:39.220
and they had hangars out there, and, and, and, and, 
and, and so, I thought, well, gosh. Maybe we could

14:49.849 --> 14:50.800
do something with that facility. Now there was 
another, another thought that entered, entered

14:53.960 --> 14:55.350
my mind at that time, and that was that, we had 
gotten the wind tunnel, the big wind tunnel, back

14:58.330 --> 14:59.351
in operation. And we were working there. And it 
occurred to me that, if we could have a flight lab,

15:03.330 --> 15:06.660
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, 
and, and, and, and, We could not only do wind tunnel

15:20.210 --> 15:28.580
tests, but we could take the results of those tests 
and flight test them, put them actually on an

15:28.560 --> 15:33.340
airplane, you see. And the number of 
institutions, universities that had that

15:33.320 --> 15:39.710
capability, counted easily on a thing or another. 
And so I thought, it just might lead to something

15:46.450 --> 15:52.230
good. Well, here again, thank God for Aggie 
students and the unbelievable enthusiasm. And

16:03.930 --> 16:07.898
thank God for T.U.' 's money. Because, again, I 
went to Harry Whitmore and laid the idea before

16:08.200 --> 16:13.240
him. And I have to tell you, dear,

16:13.220 --> 16:30.040
I don't think I have ever gone to Harry Whitmore.

16:30.020 --> 16:37.960
You know, that's just, that's unbelievable. But 
in any event, he said, Yeah, but let's pursue that.

16:42.940 --> 16:55.470
And so he gave me a little bit of money with which I 
could hire some students.

16:55.450 --> 17:00.470
So the first thing they did was to, and then Mr. 
Benson went to that for us and got the animal

17:00.450 --> 17:05.620
science people to move their damn fences off the 
runways so we could have access to some of the

17:05.600 --> 17:09.940
runways. And that, that was not easy to do. Excuse 
me? Were the runways still in good shape? Oh yeah,

17:15.920 --> 17:17.940
uh-huh, yeah. They just had fences. They

17:18.920 --> 17:24.510
had fences across them. But as you know, the Ags run 
this institution. And I guess always will,

17:27.870 --> 17:36.090
even though, but it was not, it required the clout 
that Mr. Benson had in order to get that, get that

17:40.440 --> 17:46.480
airport made back into an airport. Well, we got 
that done and my students had surveyed the runways

17:51.460 --> 17:54.820
and some of the older runways were in very good 
shape. The TTI was using them, so, but the two new

17:57.560 --> 18:12.630
runways

17:57.560 --> 18:12.630
were still active.

18:12.610 --> 18:16.630
And we were, you know, they looked at the landing 
lights and runway lights, whether or not,

18:16.610 --> 18:28.560
gasoline storage facilities and things like 
that. And we had, and Harry got us the hangar out

18:28.540 --> 18:34.560
there that is currently the flight line. And of 
course it looked like it was about to fall down and

18:40.640 --> 18:49.880
so we had to have some structural. If you're going 
to have a flight test facility, it helps to have an

18:49.860 --> 18:57.370
airport. So I had been a pretty successful 
scrounger, a major surplus property. So here was

19:07.430 --> 19:11.560
where the Research Foundation came in. Mr. A.D. 
Rickett, the Vice President of the Research

19:11.540 --> 19:16.560
Foundation. But at that time, he was property 
manager. And among other things, handled all the

19:21.200 --> 19:27.130
surplus property. Well, this got to be a joke. And 
Rick and I are now very close friends and we still

19:31.110 --> 19:33.130
talk about those days. And he used to get these 
lists of surplus property. And we

19:38.110 --> 19:44.700
would go through them. And I got some stuff for the 
shock tube and I got some things for the wind

19:46.680 --> 19:48.700
tunnel. And it turned out there was occasionally 
an airplane in the showroom. Well, most of the time

19:53.700 --> 20:02.580
they were not

19:53.700 --> 20:02.580
particularly well suited to, that

20:02.560 --> 20:13.690
triggers

20:02.560 --> 20:13.690
a whole lot of memories. Also,

20:13.670 --> 20:22.650
keep in mind again, this was mid and late 60s. I

20:22.630 --> 20:32.650
was trying to help the Vietnamese. We had, we were 
tracking two airplanes pretty closely. And

20:38.220 --> 20:41.420
within, of course, a space of two weeks, these were 
surplus airplanes. Within the course of two

20:43.400 --> 20:48.630
weeks, we lost both of them because they had 
decided that they were going to take anything that

20:48.610 --> 20:52.720
would fly. And

20:52.700 --> 21:00.510
so here we were with a flight lab and some eager 
students and no airplane. Well,

21:03.490 --> 21:08.100
I had heard from Mr. Bruce, who incidentally 
deserves an awful lot of credit, because Joe, and

21:13.280 --> 21:18.340
then he had the beginnings of the Research and 
Instruments shop

21:18.320 --> 21:24.560
on the way. And of course, he's, he, Joe Bruce is an 
absolute genius. He contributed to

21:29.490 --> 21:51.150
TEAS and to

21:29.490 --> 21:51.150
this.

21:51.130 --> 22:00.070
But I knew from Joe that the Grumman aircraft had 
given us, had given Texas A&M the number one and

22:00.050 --> 22:07.500
number two airplanes that were built to be crop 
testers. They were designed from the ground up as

22:10.690 --> 22:13.930
crop testers. They were converted to that. And 
back in the early days, before I came here, in fact,

22:20.360 --> 22:24.050
it was still underway when I came here, in the Plant 
Sciences Department, there was a different

22:26.030 --> 22:41.270
kinds of spray apparatus and so forth on it, but

22:43.250 --> 22:48.630
the, the other airplane. And

22:48.610 --> 23:07.180
so, and so I went out and, and

22:48.610 --> 23:07.180
again, and I said, you know, it may be that we'll 
have to put

23:14.660 --> 23:23.360
something in the air again to a potential sponsor. 
And the proposed research work, if you don't even

23:25.560 --> 23:27.580
have an airplane with you. And so, the day we went 
out there, Bruce

23:37.040 --> 23:44.300
got his keys and we went over to a warehouse there at 
the annex,

23:53.640 --> 23:54.661
laden with junk. There in the back of the room, 
wings off, no engine, up

24:01.660 --> 24:19.740
against

24:01.660 --> 24:19.740
the reenactment

24:01.660 --> 24:19.740
of

24:01.660 --> 24:19.740
the, and I said, folks, if we're going out in the 
flight lab in

24:25.970 --> 24:39.910
about

24:25.970 --> 24:39.910
four to five months, where

24:39.890 --> 24:53.720
the

24:39.890 --> 24:53.720
material

24:39.890 --> 24:53.720
to be sprayed had been taken out, and we put a second 
cockpit in there. Of course, an open cockpit by

24:58.460 --> 25:02.370
plane. And, and we had, I had acquired some surplus 
research. And, and

25:06.790 --> 25:23.420
here again,

25:23.400 --> 25:26.420
it was all done with T's money. And

25:26.400 --> 25:33.170
then we, we acquired the PA-18 from the border 
patrol. And this is a Piper Cub, it's a super Cub. So

25:40.920 --> 25:50.620
we started with

25:40.920 --> 25:50.620
those two airplanes. And so we had our airport, we 
had the hangar, we had two research airplanes, and

25:55.960 --> 26:00.380
also had, if you visit the flight lab today, you'll 
see offices built along one side and in the back.

26:07.160 --> 26:16.780
None of that was there.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.781
And that was the, that was the beginning of the 
flight lab. Again,

26:19.760 --> 26:25.310
without T's, it simply would not have happened. It 
simply wouldn't have happened. So, What year was

26:31.040 --> 26:33.140
that? Do you remember? I'm sorry?

26:38.955 --> 26:39.660
Do you remember the year, late

26:39.640 --> 26:44.568
60's? We never had, we never had an official 
dedication. I suppose we should have. I

26:48.830 --> 26:54.010
think the flight lab, as I recall, was

26:56.140 --> 27:02.320
pretty well in operation by 67. We

27:02.300 --> 27:06.490
had been, we'd been doing a few little things prior 
to that. Matter of fact, I owned an airplane at that

27:10.470 --> 27:11.491
time. We

27:11.470 --> 27:22.240
did the, we got the AGCAT going, I think, in the 
spring of 67. And the PA-18 came along very, very

27:29.620 --> 27:31.640
shortly thereafter. And so, pretty much by the 
fall of 67, as I recall, we

27:37.960 --> 27:45.060
were, we were pretty well in operation. Now, how 
did, in, in 72, you became associate dean of

27:49.040 --> 27:52.210
engineering. Yeah. And director of the, of the 
Center for Urban Programs. Mm-hmm. What was the

27:58.085 --> 28:01.110
center? Well, it was a, it was a strange place for an 
engineer to be, I'll tell you. In late 71, after I'd

28:09.560 --> 28:11.580
come back from Maryland, and in that fall of, 
summer and fall of 71, and, and really the spring of

28:15.560 --> 28:21.900
72,

28:21.880 --> 28:22.901
that was the period of time when I was pursuing Mr. 
Benson's directive to seek out some new research

28:29.500 --> 28:32.520
areas. In

28:32.500 --> 28:37.620
the midst of all that, again,

28:37.600 --> 28:46.490
you have to understand the mood of the time. Deep

28:47.470 --> 28:53.610
in the midst of what I call the age of relevance. 
Everything that you did had to be relevant. You had

29:00.000 --> 29:02.020
to serve mankind in a very direct way. Our 
students, incidentally, respected

29:06.850 --> 29:10.170
that viewpoint. There was no joy of learning. 
There was no, there was no desire to learn

29:13.150 --> 29:14.171
anything. Just for the fun of learning it. It had to 
be relevant to something. You know, it had to be

29:19.240 --> 29:20.261
directly applicable. And the engineering 
students, they, they wanted to know just what they

29:24.800 --> 29:26.970
needed to know to be successful. No more, no less. 
Mm-hmm. But just what they needed. You still see

29:35.260 --> 29:36.281
some tinges of that yet today.

29:41.455 --> 29:42.180
Well, the same thing applied for

29:43.160 --> 29:48.330
research. One heard that during those days, 
surely

29:50.310 --> 29:56.470
to God we can do blah, blah, blah. At that point, one 
of the, in that day and age, problems

30:03.010 --> 30:10.040
of the urban areas. A lot of that came

30:11.020 --> 30:18.250
out of the unrest of the, of the unrest had its roots

30:29.960 --> 30:31.980
in, in other things. People saw a declining 
quality of life in the cities. But there was great

30:38.130 --> 30:54.930
concern

30:38.130 --> 30:54.930
at

30:38.130 --> 30:54.930
that time. And there was a, there

30:55.910 --> 31:05.790
was money. Federal money. The National Science 
Foundation at that pro, at that time had developed

31:11.200 --> 31:13.220
what they called the RAND program or Research 
Applied. It was an interesting program.

31:29.305 --> 31:30.230
And one part of it focused on urban problems. And 
that, you know, that was sort of unheard of for the

31:37.130 --> 31:40.970
National Science Foundation whose

31:40.950 --> 31:52.460
province

31:52.440 --> 31:53.461
had always been now to get involved in a nutshell.

32:01.450 --> 32:04.160
They had some, they had, and, in any event, to come 
back to Texas A&M, I was still

32:19.720 --> 32:22.140
working in the very broad for, we had started some

32:24.120 --> 32:43.510
stuff in the advanced transport. I can't think of 
his name. The guy who was the city manager of the

32:48.490 --> 32:49.511
city of

32:49.490 --> 33:02.990
Dallas for many years. He was then, at that time, he 
was an assistant city manager. And

33:09.140 --> 33:15.220
of course by that time Mr. Rutter had passed away 
and so this gentleman almost had his name there on

33:22.700 --> 33:23.721
the letter whether he wrote a letter, it seems like 
he wrote a letter, to Dr. Williams saying that he

33:29.960 --> 33:31.980
thought that Texas A&M ought to mount an effort to 
help the cities of the state of

33:41.950 --> 33:46.120
Texas. So, Dr. Williams then asked Mr. Benson and 
I'm sure the reason that he did that was because of

33:54.310 --> 33:58.020
Tease. Because you see, and this is again 
something we haven't touched on but again it's

34:02.340 --> 34:04.360
something we've been talking about for a long 
time. One of the great advantages that Tease has is

34:10.340 --> 34:11.361
its ability to hang on to some of the indirect cost 
money. Has that issue been explained to you? And

34:18.580 --> 34:20.600
other engineering experiment

34:20.580 --> 34:25.700
stations don't have that. It's an

34:27.960 --> 34:40.300
enormously

34:40.280 --> 34:42.636
powerful tool. Of course it is the source of the 
money. And so Tease has been called upon to start a

34:50.720 --> 34:53.850
lot of things. The cyclotron, the food protein 
center, the computer system, all started from

35:00.880 --> 35:14.630
Tease and it

35:00.880 --> 35:14.630
was a sack of snakes. I mean, a lot of people will say 
Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, Texas

35:19.670 --> 35:22.260
Engineering Experiment Station, they're about 
the same name, they must be about the same. Wrong.

35:30.898 --> 35:40.300
They're

35:30.898 --> 35:40.300
as

35:40.280 --> 35:42.300
different as night and day. So, Dr. Williams

35:49.000 --> 35:53.100
then asked me to have this, the name of Thomas that 
was supposed to be seeking out new research things

36:01.200 --> 36:03.590
for Tease to do. And so he called me into his

36:08.640 --> 36:17.370
office and said,

36:17.350 --> 36:19.370
would you take a look at this? And so that was the 
beginning of the cyclotron. Anything. Which I

36:28.166 --> 36:28.570
guess later

36:28.550 --> 36:34.080
on we saw that as well. So, I took some Tease money 
and jumped in my airplane, take a little tour

36:45.860 --> 36:48.320
around the state and

36:48.300 --> 36:52.900
talk with city officials and sound them out on 
this. Generally positive real.

37:14.631 --> 37:18.160
Some

37:14.631 --> 37:18.160
were, some were, gave us some

37:20.320 --> 37:27.070
advice that was absolutely that I could go to

37:29.050 --> 37:46.900
those

37:46.880 --> 37:48.696
places. And, and that I was relatively sure

37:57.780 --> 38:00.780
that we could . And

38:01.101 --> 38:08.790
so Mr. Benson went back to the makings of a good

38:18.180 --> 38:23.940
program here. He thought an organization ought to 
be established to pursue this. He even said, fine

38:34.100 --> 38:36.120
Mr. Chairman, whom do you want on your board? And I 
said, well,

38:42.370 --> 39:07.130
you

38:42.370 --> 39:07.130
know,

39:07.110 --> 39:12.640
we've got thousands of colleges that we thought we 
would . And

39:16.840 --> 39:23.060
so they, they formed a kind of an oversight group. 
So, rather

39:29.450 --> 39:39.050
quickly then, the other things that I had been 
pursuing for Mr. Benson sort of . In fact, I think it

39:51.530 --> 39:53.550
was a couple of years ago, I think, that Mr. Benson 
was the head of the Department of Economics at the

40:11.560 --> 40:13.580
University of Minnesota. And he was the head of the 
Department of Development. No, the focus of the

40:27.560 --> 40:29.580
Center for Urban Programs

40:29.560 --> 40:35.120
was to help

40:35.100 --> 40:38.780
cities deliver services more and to manage more. 
So, we developed all continuing education

40:49.270 --> 40:53.170
programs for city managers and other subsystem 
managers. For example, no surprise at all, but we

41:02.180 --> 41:06.400
embarked on a management assistance

41:08.380 --> 41:13.820
program. Well,

41:13.800 --> 41:19.710
we had a lot of things. And here again, at

41:23.690 --> 41:27.780
this point, I have to throw some more accolades. 
When you start a program from scratch like that,

41:39.430 --> 41:41.920
here again, without any proven expertise

41:43.900 --> 41:47.670
to work in the community or to actually do anything 
in our community, it's not going to be

42:02.720 --> 42:08.700
a good job. It's

42:10.680 --> 42:14.860
not going to be a good job. And in the

42:24.810 --> 43:02.020
end about

43:02.000 --> 43:26.130
a building, about let me worry about you, just 
concentrate on building a park. But all of this,

43:26.110 --> 43:29.130
that's the way it ought to be done. Again,

43:29.110 --> 43:41.410
to be somewhat critical of our current T's, 
leadership

43:29.110 --> 43:41.410
does not understand. What I'm saying to you, the 
power, the strength, the sort of grudging respect

43:51.400 --> 43:57.690
that T's currently enjoys in the Texas A&M 
community, and I think in other parts of the state

43:57.670 --> 44:03.060
and the nation, but also

44:03.040 --> 44:17.700
largely, in Cliff's instance,

44:17.680 --> 44:23.360
his view was that if I had a self-supporting 
program within five years, that would be great.

44:23.340 --> 44:29.270
And if it took eight years, then it just took eight 
years. And you just don't find that kind of

44:29.250 --> 44:42.150
attitude or the ability to do that in other areas or 
in other institutions. And so in any event,

44:42.130 --> 44:47.150
interestingly, shortly after that, very sure 
within six months of that conversation I had,

44:50.860 --> 44:51.881
things started to break for us. And again, it was 
because we'd had T's money to go out and do a few

44:51.860 --> 44:56.880
things, and I could go to the land program people in 
MSF, and to the HUD people, it was Housing and Urban

45:00.860 --> 45:04.880
Development at that time, and tell them what we had 
done. We had a trash record. I had faculty

45:09.360 --> 45:14.460
identified that had expertise, you see. We had 
gone out and the city manager had called us. And so,

45:23.110 --> 45:43.370
and again,

45:23.110 --> 45:43.370
that was all because

45:23.110 --> 45:43.370
tremendously

45:23.110 --> 45:43.370
important. The understanding of, and

45:43.350 --> 45:52.960
so within six months after that conversation, I 
think we had a backlog of something like $750,000.

45:56.940 --> 46:01.580
We had started, we had gotten into the Urban 
Observatory program.
