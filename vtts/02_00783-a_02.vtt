WEBVTT

00:03.080 --> 00:06.260
came out of our productivity program. The 
industrial engineering department is now

00:06.240 --> 00:12.260
involved in an Air Force effort to set up an 
artificial intelligence program. And a

00:16.420 --> 00:24.980
lot of the advanced manufacturing system work 
that is currently being done by Dr. Don Phillips

00:24.960 --> 00:31.010
and others in industrial engineering had its 
roots in the productivity program. And so,

00:33.990 --> 00:40.010
although it does not exist as such now, it laid the 
foundation for some activities

00:39.990 --> 00:46.790
in our program. And incidentally, here again, the 
only reason that that thing succeeded was that Mr.

00:53.660 --> 01:04.000
Gunson and Mr. Whitmore gave me a chunk of TEE's 
money with which to promote

00:53.660 --> 01:04.000
it. That's the only thing we did. If I can tell you 
just a quick story. About that time, Dr. Ray

01:11.200 --> 01:16.660
Goforth, who at that time was in industrial 
engineering, but now is in industrial

01:16.640 --> 01:24.580
engineering. One summer, using TEE's money, we 
pursued this problem of why weren't numerically

01:32.050 --> 01:37.070
controlled machines showing up, particularly in 
what we call the mom and pop machine shops, the

01:37.050 --> 01:42.070
little job shops. But again, and

01:42.050 --> 01:51.120
don't misunderstand, they're not always just, 
you know, real small operations, some of those

01:52.100 --> 01:55.120
things. And

01:55.100 --> 02:06.050
so, with TEE's money, we did a study of the barriers 
to the utilization of numerically controlled

02:06.030 --> 02:10.050
machines in small shops. It turned out to have been 
a mere classic. And

02:13.170 --> 02:26.500
gave us credibility,

02:13.170 --> 02:26.500
research activities, research sponsorship. And 
so, and this is again, you see, the thing that you

02:27.210 --> 02:32.230
have to do. You can't take an outfit that has no 
track record in a given area and go to a sponsor and

02:39.460 --> 02:43.660
say, here, give me some money to do some work in that 
area. He's going to say, well, what the hell have

02:43.640 --> 02:46.660
you done? And quite improperly so. And if you say, 
well, nothing, but if you give us some money, we're

02:51.640 --> 02:53.660
going to do something great. That ain't going to 
get it. And so,

02:58.030 --> 03:07.440
the money that we got from the National Science 
Foundation came out of a, really came out of that

03:07.420 --> 03:17.680
little study that Greg wrote for us in the summer of 
1776. And

03:17.660 --> 03:29.260
it led to an exchange that I had with a guy from the 
National Science Foundation because they had a

03:29.240 --> 03:32.260
productivity program. The

03:32.240 --> 03:48.190
interesting thing that came out of our study was 
because they were afraid of it. They didn't

03:48.170 --> 03:50.190
understand it. They didn't understand what they 
could, what these devices could do for them. And

03:54.170 --> 03:56.190
they were afraid of it. They were afraid of what 
they might do to them. And that, and Ray's work that

03:59.860 --> 04:07.950
summer, and he had a couple of students work with 
him, I thought was magnificent. And it brought

04:10.720 --> 04:20.540
that,

04:10.720 --> 04:20.540
as it so happened, I went to a meeting sponsored by 
the National Science Foundation dealing with

04:20.520 --> 04:26.400
productivity matters, and they got into this very 
issue. Their view, traditional Bank of the

04:26.380 --> 04:33.400
Potomac's myopia, was that it all rested on money. 
If these people just had money, they would go buy

04:35.380 --> 04:39.400
these machines and use them and so forth. It was 
obvious that the people in Houston, I mean most of

04:44.560 --> 04:49.580
them tied to the petrochemical industry making 
machine parts for them, they were laughing all the

04:49.560 --> 04:51.920
way at the bank. I mean money, money was anything 
but a problem. And so a matter of fact, in this

04:54.900 --> 05:00.130
public meeting up in Rochester, New York, I got 
into a rather heated discussion with this guy. And

05:03.110 --> 05:12.910
so, you know,

05:03.110 --> 05:12.910
I told him, we've got data to dispute that. He said, 
I want to see that. And so he did see it, and that led

05:16.400 --> 05:25.370
to, well, it led to a lot of it. We eventually got 
involved in the Air Force's

05:25.350 --> 05:38.830
HICAM program.

05:38.810 --> 05:42.830
Because of this little rigging study that we had 
done, we're sort of nationally recognized

05:42.810 --> 05:47.830
experts on technology transfer. But it's just an 
indication again of the power of just a little bit

05:47.810 --> 05:55.050
of tease winning. And again, if it hadn't been 
there, we wouldn't have done anything. Let's go

05:59.530 --> 06:03.050
back to the flight land. Oh, okay. Bond Farley. 
Yeah, okay, back to the 60s land. Of

06:11.020 --> 06:22.350
course, I had, when I came here in 64, having been 
involved in hypersonic, and I don't think, you

06:26.090 --> 06:35.240
know, at that time we couldn't foresee that as soon 
as the Apollo had been successful, that investing

06:40.800 --> 06:51.890
in space-type research was a heck of a good thing to 
do. So,

06:51.870 --> 06:56.340
you know, so I was, and

06:56.320 --> 07:08.430
I was primarily an experimentalist. I hadn't

07:08.410 --> 07:18.260
done a lot of theoretical work. Of course, we 
didn't have a hypersonic facility here. And so it

07:22.240 --> 07:27.830
seemed as though that the most inexpensive 
facility that would, for very, very short

07:27.810 --> 07:38.110
periods, would

07:38.090 --> 07:46.570
create a very high-pressure shock wave which 
rushes down

07:46.550 --> 07:56.550
behind it, with it, at very high speeds. And

07:56.530 --> 08:05.360
back in those days, of course, we were, you know, 
because aerodynamics

08:05.340 --> 08:16.300
was in a completely new realm. There

08:16.280 --> 08:25.110
is nitrogen and oxygen, atomic molecules, 
principle. Well, those molecules, in addition to

08:25.090 --> 08:30.360
bouncing off one another like billiard balls, 
they, they, they molecule, the individual atoms

08:33.560 --> 08:47.260
in

08:33.560 --> 08:47.260
the molecule working together. But when you talk 
about a re-entry theory, whistling back into the

08:50.360 --> 08:55.050
atmosphere at very, very high speeds, it has a 
shock wave. There's a temperature

08:57.080 --> 09:04.220
jump across any shock wave, even

09:04.200 --> 09:11.900
though it might be, you know, and, but when you talk 
about Mach here, the temperature jump is so great

09:18.100 --> 09:21.120
that it causes those molecules, those atoms to, 
causes the molecules to dissociate. And so you

09:24.250 --> 09:27.360
have a chemical reaction. The M2 becomes 2N. And 
same thing for oxygen. So this air, or this gas,

09:32.340 --> 09:36.380
behind the shock wave is no longer air. It's, it's, 
it's some weird new gas. And the fact that that

09:42.360 --> 09:45.380
structure has changed makes it, made it very 
difficult to predict the lift of things like the

09:51.280 --> 09:55.080
Mercury capsule. If you recall the early Mercury 
flights, some

09:57.060 --> 10:11.690
of them, the guy landed miles from the touchdown 
point. And the principal reason there was, of

10:14.720 --> 10:16.740
course, he was, he was flying it, but

10:16.720 --> 10:27.250
nonetheless, our, our inability to predict lift 
and drag was very great. Largely because we just

10:29.640 --> 10:34.670
didn't understand this strange new, the 
ionization blackout. The temperatures were so

10:36.650 --> 10:39.980
high that the electrons would peel off of these 
atoms and create this sheath of ions behind, and

10:46.780 --> 10:53.690
the radio wave wouldn't penetrate it.

10:53.670 --> 11:00.900
So all of that stuff at that time was way out stuff. 
And so shock tubes could create shock waves strong

11:00.880 --> 11:11.140
enough.

11:11.120 --> 11:37.620
And so, again, it was

11:11.120 --> 11:37.620
the

11:11.120 --> 11:37.620
foundation for some research work. So the

11:37.600 --> 11:51.040
shock tube lab there, and we got a bit, we had a 
building given to us out at the Annex. And then,

11:56.230 --> 12:17.570
too, we had another stranger.

12:17.550 --> 12:22.990
Some students came to me and said,

12:22.970 --> 12:24.990
the traditional areas, you know, specialization 
within aerodynamics, and that sort

12:30.800 --> 12:45.710
of

12:30.800 --> 12:45.710
thing.

12:45.690 --> 12:48.310
But the fourth area is flight mechanics. Which, 
which deals with the entire vehicle. And it deals

12:52.320 --> 12:54.340
with stability and control, and that sort of 
thing. And so, some students came to me and said,

13:03.300 --> 13:19.040
look, here

13:03.300 --> 13:19.040
we were,

13:19.020 --> 13:25.610
with a beautiful facility,

13:25.590 --> 13:29.750
with parallel 7,500 foot runway. And at that time, 
we had horses. I,

13:31.730 --> 13:47.790
to me, I think

13:31.730 --> 13:47.790
the saddest thing is a relic, you know, that's just 
uncared for, sitting

13:57.060 --> 14:02.060
in the corner of an airport or in a hangar, and just, 
you know, falling. You

14:04.040 --> 14:08.960
know, you think that at one time, it was a beautiful 
sight in flight. There it sits, rusting and

14:15.060 --> 14:20.980
deteriorating.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.980
The second saddest thing, I think, is an abandoned 
airport. You can imagine that all the time, you

14:29.070 --> 14:31.090
know, great and wonderful things that happened in 
the past. People

14:33.160 --> 14:37.220
learning to fly. Now it's just a cow pasture, or in 
that case, a horse pasture. And, um, and they had

14:42.480 --> 14:45.500
hangars out there that were just unused. And so, I 
thought, well, gosh, maybe we could do something

14:53.960 --> 14:57.350
with that facility. Now there was another, 
another thought that entered my mind at that time,

15:02.330 --> 15:05.660
and that was that, uh, we had gotten the wind 
tunnel, the big wind tunnel, back in operation

15:09.790 --> 15:12.760
when we were working there. And it occurred to me 
that if we could have a flight lab, that that would

15:15.740 --> 15:18.760
give us a very powerful combination. Uh, we could 
not only do wind tunnel tests, but we could take the

15:24.210 --> 15:27.580
results of those tests and flight test them, put 
them actually on an airplane, you see. And the

15:33.320 --> 15:36.340
number of, uh, institutions, universities that 
had that capability counted

15:39.690 --> 15:44.170
easily on a thing or another. And, uh, so I thought, 
it might, it just might lead to something good.

15:52.210 --> 15:54.380
Well, here again, uh, I want to thank God for, for 
Aggie students and, uh, unbelievable

15:58.480 --> 16:04.632
enthusiasm. And thank God for Key's money. 
Because, again, I meant, I went to Harry Whitmore

16:09.200 --> 16:13.240
and laid the idea before him. And I have to tell you, 
dear, I don't think I have ever gone to Harry

16:15.220 --> 16:20.250
Whitmore. You

16:20.230 --> 16:31.040
know, that's just, that's unbelievable.

16:36.709 --> 16:38.960
Uh, but in any event, uh, he, uh, he said, yeah, 
let's pursue that. And so he gave me a little bit of

16:41.940 --> 16:44.960
money with which I could hire some students.

16:55.450 --> 16:58.470
So the first thing they did was to, and then Mr. 
Benson went to that for us and got the, uh, the

17:00.450 --> 17:03.620
animal science people to move their damn fences 
off the runways so we could have, uh, have access to

17:07.920 --> 17:09.940
some of the runways. And that, that was not easy to 
do. Excuse me? Were the runways still in good

17:14.035 --> 17:15.940
shape? Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. They just had 
fences across them. Uh,

17:19.920 --> 17:26.510
but as you know, the Ags run this institution, and I 
guess always will, even though, but

17:28.870 --> 17:37.090
it was not, uh, it required the clout that Mr. 
Benson had in order to get that, get that airport

17:41.440 --> 17:44.460
made back into an airport. Well, we got that done, 
and my students had surveyed the, uh, the runways,

17:50.460 --> 17:52.480
and some of the older runways were in very good 
shape, but TTI was using them. So, okay, but the two

17:55.800 --> 18:08.470
new runways were still active. Uh, but we were, you 
know, they looked at, uh, they looked at the

18:13.610 --> 18:15.630
landing lights and, uh, runway lights, whether or 
not, uh, gasoline storage facilities, and things

18:24.720 --> 18:28.560
like that. And, uh, and we had, uh, and Harry got us, 
uh, the hangar out there that is currently the

18:32.540 --> 18:34.560
flight line. Of course, it looked like it was about 
to fall down, and so we had to have some structural,

18:39.640 --> 18:49.880
uh, if you're gonna have a flight test facility, it 
helps to have an airport. So,

18:53.860 --> 19:05.450
I had been a pretty successful scrounger of 
surplus property. So, here was where the Research

19:07.430 --> 19:11.560
Foundation came in. Mr. A.D. Rickett, the Vice 
President of the Research Foundation, at that

19:16.540 --> 19:21.220
time, he was property manager. And among other 
things, uh, handled all the surplus property. Uh,

19:25.570 --> 19:29.130
well, this got to be a joke, uh, and Rick and I are now 
very close friends, and we still talk about those

19:31.110 --> 19:33.130
days, and, uh, he used to get these lists of surplus 
property. And, uh, we would

19:38.110 --> 19:44.700
go through those lists, and I got some stuff for the 
show. I got a shock tube, and I got some things for

19:47.680 --> 19:49.720
the wind tunnel, and, uh, and it turned out there 
was occasionally an airplane in the show. Well,

19:56.160 --> 19:57.181
most of the time, they were not particularly well 
suited to, uh, that triggers

20:02.560 --> 20:18.650
a whole lot of memories. Also, keep in mind, again, 
this was, uh, this

20:20.630 --> 20:29.620
was mid and late 60s. I was trying to help the, uh, 
the Vietnamese. Uh, we had, we were tracking two

20:32.630 --> 20:39.420
airplanes pretty closely. And within, of course, 
a space of two weeks, uh, these were surplus

20:41.400 --> 20:43.420
airplanes. Uh, within the course of two weeks, uh, 
we lost both of them, because, uh, they had decided

20:50.700 --> 20:57.420
that they were going to take anything that would 
fly. And so, here we were with a flight lab and some

21:00.490 --> 21:03.510
eager students and no airplane. Well,

21:03.490 --> 21:10.300
I had heard from Mr. Bruce, who incidentally 
deserves an awful lot of credit, uh, because Joe,

21:15.490 --> 21:18.340
and then he had the beginnings of the research and 
instrument shop on the way. And,

21:20.320 --> 21:26.510
of course, he's, he, Joe Bruce is an absolute 
genius, uh, contributed to

21:29.490 --> 21:51.150
TEAS and to

21:29.490 --> 21:51.150
this.

21:51.130 --> 21:55.040
But I, I knew from, uh, from Joe the

21:55.020 --> 22:00.070
Grumman aircraft had given us, had given Texas A&M 
the number one and number two airplanes that were

22:07.480 --> 22:10.710
built to be crop testers. In other words, they were 
designed from the ground up as crop testers. They

22:13.910 --> 22:16.080
were converted to that. And, uh, back in the early 
days, before I came here, in fact, it was still

22:20.360 --> 22:23.050
underway. When I came here, uh, in the plant 
sciences department, there was a, uh,

22:37.940 --> 22:40.270
different kinds of, uh, spray apparatus and so 
forth on it and

22:42.250 --> 22:46.630
they grew up, you know. But the, uh, the other 
airplane, and

22:48.610 --> 23:03.490
so, and

22:48.610 --> 23:03.490
so, uh, I went out and, uh, and again, and I said, you 
know, it may be that we'll have to, uh,

23:19.240 --> 23:20.261
put something in the air again to a potential 
sponsor and, uh, propose research work if you

23:25.560 --> 23:27.580
don't even have an airplane with you. And so, uh,

23:36.040 --> 23:37.061
the day we went out there, Bruce

23:37.040 --> 23:42.300
got his keys and we went over to a warehouse there at 
the annex laden

23:45.280 --> 23:54.660
with junk.

23:54.640 --> 23:58.120
There in the back of the room, wings off, no engine, 
up

24:01.660 --> 24:19.740
against

24:01.660 --> 24:19.740
the reenactment

24:01.660 --> 24:19.740
of

24:01.660 --> 24:19.740
the, and

24:19.720 --> 24:23.990
I said, folks, if we're going out in the flight lab 
in

24:25.970 --> 24:39.910
about

24:25.970 --> 24:39.910
four to five months where

24:39.890 --> 24:53.720
the

24:39.890 --> 24:53.720
material

24:39.890 --> 24:53.720
to be sprayed had been taken out and we put a second 
cockpit in there, of course an open cockpit by

24:58.460 --> 25:02.370
plane, and, uh, and we had, I had acquired some 
surplus research and,

25:06.790 --> 25:24.420
uh, and

25:06.790 --> 25:24.420
here again, it was all done with T's money. And

25:26.400 --> 25:31.170
then we, uh, we acquired, uh, the PA-18 from the 
border patrol. And this is a Piper Cub. It's a super

25:38.920 --> 25:40.940
Cub. So we started with

25:40.920 --> 25:50.620
those two airplanes. And so we had our airport, we 
had the hangar, we had, we had two research

25:53.650 --> 25:56.980
airplanes, and, uh, also had, uh, if you visit the 
flight lab today, you'll see offices built along

26:02.360 --> 26:05.380
one side and in the back. None of that was there.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.781
And that was the, that was the beginning of the 
flight lab. Again,

26:19.760 --> 26:26.910
without T's, it simply would not have happened. It 
simply wouldn't have happened. So,

26:31.040 --> 26:35.140
uh, I'm sorry?

26:44.830 --> 26:46.850
We never had an official dedication, I suppose, 
that we should have.

26:52.990 --> 26:54.011
I think the flight lab, as I recall, was

26:56.140 --> 27:02.320
pretty well in operation by 67. Uh,

27:02.300 --> 27:06.490
we had been, uh, we'd been doing a few little 
things, uh, prior to that. Matter of fact, I

27:11.470 --> 27:22.240
owned an airplane at that time. We did the, uh, we 
got the AGCAT going, I think, in the spring of 67.

27:28.620 --> 27:30.640
And the PA-18 came along very, very shortly 
thereafter. And so, pretty much by the fall of 67,

27:35.960 --> 27:36.981
as I recall, we were, we were pretty well in 
operation. Now,

27:39.960 --> 27:46.060
how did, in, in 72, uh, you became associate dean of 
engineering. Yeah. And director of the, of the

27:54.190 --> 27:56.210
Center for Urban Programs. Mm-hmm. What was the 
Center for Urban Programs? Well, it was a, it was a

28:03.090 --> 28:05.110
strange place for an engineer to be, I'll tell you. 
Uh, in late 71, after I'd come back from Maryland,

28:11.560 --> 28:13.580
and, and in that fall of, summer and fall of 71, uh, 
and, and really the spring of 72, uh,

28:18.560 --> 28:23.900
that was the period of time when I was, uh,

28:23.880 --> 28:32.520
pursuing Mr. Benson's directive to seek out some 
new research areas. In

28:32.500 --> 28:37.620
the midst of all that, uh,

28:37.600 --> 28:46.490
again, you have to understand the mood of the time. 
Deep in, uh, the midst of what I call the age of

28:54.590 --> 28:56.610
relevance. Everything that you did had to be 
relevant. You had to serve mankind in a very direct

29:00.000 --> 29:04.870
way. Our students, incidentally, respected

29:06.850 --> 29:10.170
that viewpoint. There was no joy of learning. 
There was no, uh, there was no desire to learn

29:12.150 --> 29:14.170
anything. Just for the fun of learning it. It had to 
be relevant to something. You know, it had to be

29:16.150 --> 29:18.260
directly applicable. And the engineering 
students, uh, they wanted to know just what they

29:19.240 --> 29:21.260
needed to know to be successful. No more, no less. 
Mm-hmm. But just what they needed. You still see

29:26.950 --> 29:27.971
some tinges of that, you know, to this day. Well, 
the same thing applied for research. You know,

29:31.950 --> 29:34.280
the, the, the, the, the,

29:42.160 --> 29:48.330
uh, the,

29:48.310 --> 29:50.330
the, uh, the,

29:50.310 --> 29:57.470
uh,

29:57.450 --> 30:01.030
uh,

29:57.450 --> 30:01.030
the, the, the, the, be applied

30:03.010 --> 30:10.040
for research, uh.

30:17.190 --> 30:17.250
Uh, one heard that, uh, during those days, surely 
to God,

30:29.960 --> 30:30.981
we can do, blah, blah, blah,

30:32.960 --> 30:36.150
uh, at that point, one would be, uh,

30:38.130 --> 30:54.930
in that

30:38.130 --> 30:54.930
day and age, uh, the urban areas.

31:04.770 --> 31:24.300
Uh, The National Science Foundation at that time 
had developed what they called the RAN program, or

31:04.770 --> 31:24.300
Research Applied, and it was an interesting 
program. And

31:24.280 --> 31:33.230
one part of it focused on urban problems. And that 
was sort of unheard of for the National Science

31:33.210 --> 31:54.460
Foundation, whose province had always been known 
to get

31:33.210 --> 31:54.460
involved in a nutshell. They

31:54.440 --> 32:22.140
had some, and,

31:54.440 --> 32:22.140
but in any event, to come back to Texas A&M,

31:54.440 --> 32:22.140
I was still

31:54.440 --> 32:22.140
working very broad. We had started

32:22.120 --> 32:35.258
some stuff in the

32:22.120 --> 32:35.258
advanced transport. I

32:35.278 --> 32:43.510
can't

32:35.278 --> 32:43.510
think of his name. The guy who was the city manager 
of the city of Dallas for many years, he was then, at

32:43.490 --> 33:02.990
that time, he was an assistant city manager.

33:02.970 --> 33:17.220
And of course, by that time, Mr. Rutter had passed 
away, and so this gentleman

33:02.970 --> 33:17.220
almost had his name there. But that's about it. 
This gentleman from the city of Dallas, I can't

33:18.700 --> 33:27.480
remember whether he came down or whether he wrote a 
letter, seems like he wrote a letter, to Dr.

33:27.460 --> 33:37.260
Williams, saying that he thought that Texas A&M 
ought to mount an effort to help the cities of the

33:27.460 --> 33:37.260
state of Texas. So

33:37.240 --> 33:59.360
Dr. Williams then asked Mr. Benson, and I'm sure 
the reason that he did that was because of Tease,

33:37.240 --> 33:59.360
because you see, and this is, again, something 
that's very important. This is something that we

34:00.340 --> 34:05.360
haven't touched on, but again, it's something I'm 
sure you've heard by now. One of the great

34:05.340 --> 34:11.360
advantages that Tease has is its ability to hang on 
to some of the indirect cost money. Has that issue

34:11.340 --> 34:15.580
been explained to you? And other engineering 
experiment stations, incidentally, don't have

34:15.560 --> 34:20.600
that. It's

34:20.580 --> 34:25.700
an enormously powerful tool. Of course, it is the 
source of the money. And so Tease

34:27.960 --> 34:46.100
has been called upon.

34:46.080 --> 34:51.740
It's been called upon by the university to do, to 
start a lot of things. The cyclotron, the food

34:51.720 --> 35:13.630
protein center, the computer system, all started 
from Tease, and it was a sack of snakes. I mean, a lot

35:13.610 --> 35:22.260
of people will say, Texas Agricultural 
Experiment Station, Texas Engineering

35:13.610 --> 35:22.260
Experiment Station, about the same name. They 
must be about the same. Wrong. They're as

35:24.713 --> 35:26.570
different as night and day. I wish to help Perry 
Atkinson.

35:38.930 --> 35:41.300
So Dr. Williams then asked Mr. Benson. Mr. Benson 
at

35:41.280 --> 36:00.220
that time had this, the name of Thomas, that was 
supposed to be seeking out new research things for

35:41.280 --> 36:00.220
Tease to do. And so he called me into his office and 
said, would you take a look at this? And so that was

36:05.630 --> 36:14.040
the

36:05.630 --> 36:14.040
beginning of the signal, anything. Which

36:14.020 --> 36:25.780
I guess later on, we saw that as kind of a blessing, 
because I had no preconceived notions about what

36:14.020 --> 36:25.780
could happen. What could be done or what couldn't 
be done.

36:33.060 --> 36:51.900
The first thing I did was to take some Tease money 
and jump in my airplane, take a little tour around

36:33.060 --> 36:51.900
the state and talk with city officials and sound 
them out on this. Generally, positively. Some

36:55.445 --> 37:20.340
were, some were, gave us some advice that was 
absolutely,

36:55.445 --> 37:20.340
I

36:55.445 --> 37:20.340
could go to those people and say, I have some money 
to spend. Well, I came back. Well,

37:21.320 --> 37:46.900
I came back after that jaunt and told the reliable 
thing that I thought.

37:46.880 --> 37:57.800
And that I was relatively sure of the program that 
we could do.

37:57.780 --> 38:18.200
And so Mr. Benson went back to

37:57.780 --> 38:18.200
the

37:57.780 --> 38:18.200
makings of a good program here that he thought an 
organization ought to be established to pursue

37:57.780 --> 38:18.200
this. And

38:18.180 --> 38:27.180
said, fine, Mr. Chairman, whom do you want on your 
committee? He named Benson the chairman of the

38:27.160 --> 38:32.120
oversight committee. And then Mr. Benson called 
together a group of five, as I recall, deans, other

38:32.100 --> 38:37.120
deans. These, of course, were the deans of 
colleges that we thought we would run.

38:42.370 --> 38:48.800
Geosciences.

38:49.100 --> 39:08.130
And I

38:49.100 --> 39:08.130
think, yeah,

38:49.100 --> 39:08.130
Frank Cuban. And

39:08.110 --> 39:16.860
so they, they formed a kind of an oversight group. 
So,

39:16.840 --> 39:29.470
rather quickly then, the other things that I had 
been pursuing for Mr. Benson sort of. And in the

39:29.450 --> 39:41.050
50s, 40s and

39:29.450 --> 39:41.050
50s.

39:41.030 --> 39:49.340
There had been a lot of research done on 
industrialization of cities and surveys and that

39:41.030 --> 39:49.340
kind of thing. Is this, had this been going on? And 
did you then pick these things up and take them on?

39:54.530 --> 39:57.580
Or did you start totally? Yeah. No, dear. The, 
well, keep in mind, we had at that point, we had the

39:59.560 --> 40:07.580
industrial economics research division here run 
by Jim Bradley. That was still doing those? Oh,

40:08.560 --> 40:09.866
yes. Right. And, as a matter of fact, was absorbed 
into this center. When it was established in 78.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.580
But not into the urban center? No. Okay. It, it, it 
functions separately. And it dealt with economic

40:19.560 --> 40:21.580
development. No. The focus of the Center for Urban 
Programs was to help cities deliver services

40:23.085 --> 40:34.120
more.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.121
And to manage more. So, we developed old 
continuing education programs for city managers

40:35.100 --> 40:44.180
and other subsystem managers. For example, no 
surprise to you if I told you that we remounted. A

40:49.270 --> 40:57.020
continuing

40:49.270 --> 40:57.020
education program for airport managers. And 
which was quite successful for its brief tenure.

41:02.180 --> 41:08.400
But we embarked on a management assistance 
program. And

41:08.380 --> 41:14.820
while we had, we had a lot of things. And

41:14.800 --> 41:26.780
here again, at this point, I have to, I have to throw 
some more accolades.

41:26.760 --> 41:33.180
When you start a program from scratch like that. 
Here again, without any proven expertise. No. You

41:34.824 --> 41:39.450
have to have the expertise to work in the area. You 
have to have money to, to develop some

41:39.430 --> 41:46.670
credibility.

41:46.650 --> 41:53.850
And, and of course I knew that, that I was to bring 
money. As, as fast as I could. I mean, we didn't want

41:55.830 --> 41:58.850
to be on the dole forever. We didn't want to be 
using, be dependent on

41:58.830 --> 42:08.700
T's money. And, so I well remember we were. See, 
that began in 72. I guess this, this incident

42:14.840 --> 42:20.560
occurred like in 74. We had had one or two small 
grants. Who's

42:24.810 --> 43:08.650
worried about building? Let

43:08.630 --> 43:20.840
me worry

43:08.630 --> 43:20.840
about it. You just concentrate on

43:20.820 --> 43:26.130
building. Darling, that's, that's the way it 
ought to be done. Again,

43:29.110 --> 43:41.410
to be somewhat critical of our current T's 
leadership

43:29.110 --> 43:41.410
does not understand. What I'm saying to you. The 
power. The strength. The sort of grudging

43:47.710 --> 43:50.420
respect. That T's currently enjoys. The Texas A&M 
community. And I think in other parts of the state

43:57.670 --> 44:00.690
and the nation. To do largely in the cliff fences. 
His

44:04.040 --> 44:20.700
view

44:04.040 --> 44:20.700
was that if I had a self-supporting program within 
five years. That would be great. And if it took

44:21.680 --> 44:23.360
eight years. Then it just took eight years. And,

44:25.340 --> 44:32.130
and you just don't find that kind of attitude. Or 
the ability to do that. You know, in, in other

44:34.110 --> 44:37.460
areas. Or in other institutions. And

44:39.440 --> 44:43.150
so in any event. Interestingly. Shortly after 
that. Very sure within six months of that

44:46.130 --> 44:49.150
conversation I had. Things started to break for 
us. And again it was because we'd had T's money. To

44:54.860 --> 44:56.880
go out and do a few things. And I could go to the, the 
land program people in MSF. And to the HUD people.

45:02.860 --> 45:04.880
It was Housing and Urban Development at that time. 
And, and tell them what we had done. We had a trash

45:08.360 --> 45:09.381
record. I had faculty identified that, that had 
expertise. You see. We had gone out and, and the

45:14.887 --> 45:23.130
city manager.

45:23.110 --> 45:42.370
And so and

45:23.110 --> 45:42.370
again that was all because.

45:42.350 --> 45:45.710
Tremendously important, the understanding of. 
And

45:45.690 --> 45:52.960
so within, within six months after that 
conversation. I think we had a backlog of

45:52.940 --> 45:56.960
something like $750,000. We had started. We had 
gotten into the Urban Observatory Program.
