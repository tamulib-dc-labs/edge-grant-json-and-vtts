WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:07.921
Robotics program came out of our productivity 
program. The industrial engineering department

00:07.941 --> 00:18.391
is now involved in an Air Force effort to set up an 
artificial intelligence program.

00:19.352 --> 00:29.903
And a lot of the advanced manufacturing system 
work that is currently being done by Dr. Don

00:19.352 --> 00:29.903
Phillips and others in industrial engineering 
had its roots in the Park Community. And so,

00:34.643 --> 00:47.034
although it does not exist as such now, it laid the 
foundation for some activities that are

00:34.643 --> 00:47.034
currently going on. And incidentally, here 
again, the only reason that that thing succeeded

00:47.154 --> 00:59.586
was that Mr. Jensen and Mr. Whitmore gave me a chunk 
of TEE's money with which to promote them. And

01:02.866 --> 01:05.549
that's the only thing we did. And if I can tell you 
just a quick story about that thing. Dr. Ray

01:13.198 --> 01:24.911
Goforth, who at that time was in industrial 
engineering, but now is in mechanical

01:13.198 --> 01:24.911
engineering, and is a very confident guy. One 
summer, using T's money, we pursued this problem

01:28.962 --> 01:50.514
of why weren't numerically controlled machines 
showing up, particularly in what we call the

01:28.962 --> 01:50.514
mom-and-pop machine shops, the little job shops 
that, again, dot the back alleys

01:28.962 --> 01:50.514
of Houston and Dallas and other large cities. And 
don't misunderstand, they're not always just

01:50.574 --> 01:54.941
real small operations. Some of those things are 
really small. And so with T's money, we did a study

01:58.932 --> 02:09.728
of the barriers to the utilization of numerically 
controlled machines in small shops. It turned out

02:11.491 --> 02:17.800
to have been a mere classic. And gave us 
credibility that led to research activities,

02:17.820 --> 02:26.593
research sponsorship. And this is, again, you 
see, the thing that you have to do. You can't take an

02:32.728 --> 02:44.180
outfit that has no track record in a given area and 
go to a sponsor and say, here, give me some money to

02:32.728 --> 02:44.180
do some work in that area. He's going to say, well, 
what the hell have you done? And quite improperly

02:47.123 --> 02:48.304
so. And if you say, well, nothing, but if you give us 
some money, we're going to do something great.

02:55.451 --> 02:56.192
That ain't going to get it. And so we, the money that 
we got from the National Science Foundation came

02:56.678 --> 03:20.131
out of a, really came out of that little study that 
Ray Goforth did for us back in the summer of 76, I

02:56.678 --> 03:20.131
think, 76, I can't remember.

03:23.956 --> 03:25.318
And it led to an exchange that i had with a guy from 
the national science foundation because they had

03:25.619 --> 03:54.681
a productivity program at that time and and the 
interesting thing that came out of our study was

03:25.619 --> 03:54.681
that the reason people weren't using these 
advanced manufacturing systems was because they

03:25.619 --> 03:54.681
were afraid of them they didn't understand they 
didn't understand what they could what these

03:25.619 --> 03:54.681
devices could do for them and they were afraid of 
what they might do to them. And Ray's work that

03:59.968 --> 04:09.737
summer, and he had a couple of students work on it, I 
thought was magnificent. And it brought that

04:10.538 --> 04:12.980
forth very clearly. Well,

04:13.020 --> 04:24.550
as it so happened, I went to a meeting sponsored by 
the National Science Foundation dealing with

04:13.020 --> 04:24.550
productivity matters, and they got into this very 
issue. Their view, traditional Bank of the

04:26.268 --> 04:33.675
Potomac's myopia, was that it all rested on money. 
If these people just had money, they would go buy

04:33.695 --> 04:40.242
these machines and use them and so forth. Well, 
hell, it was obvious that the people in Houston, I

04:40.542 --> 04:52.214
mean, most of them tied to the petrochemical 
industry making machine parts for them, they were

04:40.542 --> 04:52.214
laughing all the way at the bank. I mean, money was 
anything but a problem. And so, as a matter of fact,

04:56.727 --> 05:08.478
in this public meeting up in Rochester, New York, I 
got into another heated discussion with this guy

04:56.727 --> 05:08.478
from the National Science Foundation, who was a 
friend, Jose Isma. And so, you know, I told him,

05:08.678 --> 05:13.703
we've got data to dispute that. And so he said, I 
want to see that. And so he did see it, and that led to

05:16.005 --> 05:24.473
our, well, it led to a lot of things. We eventually 
got involved in the Air Force's ICAM program, the

05:25.347 --> 05:38.378
Integrated Computer Engineering Manufacturing 
Program, largely because they were concerned

05:25.347 --> 05:38.378
about technology transfer. Because of this 
little rigging study that we had done, we're sort

05:38.915 --> 05:47.584
of nationally recognized experts on technology 
transfer. But it's just an indication, again, of

05:48.825 --> 05:55.733
the power of just a little bit of tease winning. And 
again, if it hadn't been there, we wouldn't have

05:55.753 --> 05:59.256
done it. Let's go back to the flight mode. Oh, okay. 
Okay,

06:05.982 --> 06:10.026
back to the 60s then.

06:14.911 --> 06:33.070
Well, of course I had naturally when I came here in 
64, having been involved in hypersonic and

06:14.911 --> 06:33.070
reentry research associated with the space 
program at that time, and I don't think, you know,

06:14.911 --> 06:33.070
at that time we couldn't We couldn't foresee that 
as soon as the Apollo program had been successful

06:34.231 --> 06:47.144
that everything was going to go downhill. We 
thought that investing in space-type research

06:47.224 --> 06:55.914
was a heck of a good thing to do. So I was obviously 
interested in promoting that when I came down

06:56.414 --> 07:03.141
here. And I was primarily an experimentalist. I 
hadn't done a lot of theoretical work. It was

07:12.100 --> 07:18.170
mostly wind tone work and making measurements and 
stuff. Of course, we didn't have a hypersonic

07:18.190 --> 07:23.238
facility here. And so it seemed as though that the 
most inexpensive facility that we could develop

07:23.258 --> 07:30.850
was a shotgun. which is a device that will create 
hypersonic flows for very, very short periods of

07:31.218 --> 07:41.613
time. And basically you have this large tube and 
you create a very high pressure shock wave which

07:41.633 --> 07:57.495
rushes down the tube and pulls the air

07:41.633 --> 07:57.495
behind it, with it, at very high speeds. And so you 
can do some good work. Back in those days, of

08:02.441 --> 08:17.939
course, the work that needed to be done was very 
basic work

08:02.441 --> 08:17.939
because aerodynamics was in a completely new 
realm. Normally, of course, air is nitrogen and

08:18.820 --> 08:26.689
oxygen, N2 and O2, both diatomic molecules, 
principally. Those molecules, in addition to

08:27.125 --> 08:39.319
bouncing off one another like billiard balls, the 
individual atoms in the molecule vibrate. There

08:39.379 --> 08:47.989
is an intermolecular bond based on largely the 
electronic attraction that holds them together.

08:48.010 --> 08:56.980
But when you talk about a re-entry theory, kind of 
whistling back into the atmosphere at very, very

08:48.010 --> 08:56.980
high speeds, it has a shockwave effect. there's a 
temperature

08:57.668 --> 09:03.955
jump across that shockwave. There's a 
temperature jump across any shockwave, even

09:04.015 --> 09:12.543
though it might be, you know, if you have a Mach 2 
fighter or a Concorde, you know, anything. But

09:12.644 --> 09:24.556
when you talk about Mach 2 or Mach 20, the 
temperature jump is so great that it causes those

09:12.644 --> 09:24.556
molecules, those atoms to, causes the molecules 
to dissociate. And so you have a chemical reaction

09:27.284 --> 09:28.946
The M2 becomes 2N. The same thing for oxygen. So 
this air, or this gas behind the shockwave is no

09:32.912 --> 09:37.298
longer air. It's some weird new gas. And the fact 
that that structure has changed

09:42.585 --> 09:54.321
makes it, made it very difficult to predict the 
lift and drag of things like the Mercury capsule.

09:54.790 --> 10:03.625
If you recall the early Mercury flights, some of 
them, there was one, who flew that? I can't

10:03.645 --> 10:03.986
remember. I think it was the third flight. The guy 
landed miles from the touchdown point. And the

10:12.060 --> 10:20.494
principal reason there was, of course, he was 
flying it at somewhat the wrong angle of attack

10:12.060 --> 10:20.494
from the back end. But nonetheless, our inability 
to predict lift and drag was very great. largely

10:31.173 --> 10:49.838
because we just didn't understand this strange 
new, the ionization blackout, you know, where

10:31.173 --> 10:49.838
even though the temperatures were so high that the 
electrons would peel off of these atoms and create

10:31.173 --> 10:49.838
this sheath of ions behind it, and the radio wave 
wouldn't penetrate it. So we had that ionization

10:49.858 --> 10:54.144
blackout period here and there. All of that stuff 
at that time was, God, that was just, that was way

10:54.164 --> 11:00.032
out stuff. And so shock tubes could create shock 
waves strong enough to cause those chemical

11:00.822 --> 11:08.613
reactions. And so we could study them. And so, 
again, good old teams and good old Harry Whitmore

11:11.137 --> 11:28.162
gave me,

11:11.137 --> 11:28.162
I can't remember, I think it was $40,000 or $50,000 
or something to build a shock tube. And we did. And

11:29.695 --> 11:47.722
again, that was the foundation for some research 
work, which, again, simply would not have

11:29.695 --> 11:47.722
happened had we not gotten that money for teams. 
Well, so the shock tube lab, and we had a building

11:47.742 --> 11:55.733
given to us out at the annex. It wasn't much of a 
building. but it worked out extremely well.

12:06.761 --> 12:12.067
And then, too, we had another strange event 
happen. About 65 or 66, some

12:12.087 --> 12:27.985
students came to me and said, well, the 
traditional areas of activity or specialization

12:12.087 --> 12:27.985
within of aerospace engineering are 
aerodynamics, which has to do with the flow of air

12:28.387 --> 12:46.927
about these mines, structures, making them 
strong enough but light enough to be built by, and

12:28.387 --> 12:46.927
propulsion, which deals with engines and power 
plants, and that sort of thing. But the fourth area

12:46.947 --> 12:55.997
is flight mechanics, which deals with the entire 
vehicle, and it deals with stability and control

12:46.947 --> 12:55.997
and performance. maneuverability and that sort 
of thing. And so some students came to me and said

13:00.738 --> 13:09.109
they were interested

13:00.738 --> 13:09.109
more in flight mechanics. Wasn't there anything 
we could do to get active in that area? Well,

13:14.335 --> 13:25.849
here we were with a beautiful facility, the old 
Bryan Air Force Base, parallel 7,500 foot

13:25.964 --> 13:40.057
runways, but at

13:25.964 --> 13:40.057
that time they had courses. To me, being one who has 
been put on airplanes

13:40.077 --> 13:54.030
for many years, I think the saddest thing that one 
can see is an abandoned airplane, an airplane as a

13:54.736 --> 14:18.413
relic, you know, that's

13:54.736 --> 14:18.413
just uncared for, sitting

13:54.736 --> 14:18.413
on the corner

13:54.736 --> 14:18.413
of an airport or in a hangar

13:54.736 --> 14:18.413
and just, you know, falling. And, you know, I think 
that at one time it was a, it must have been a

14:18.433 --> 14:20.356
beautiful sight in flight. And there it sits, 
rusting and deteriorating. The second saddest

14:21.298 --> 14:22.600
thing I think it's an abandoned airport.

14:27.296 --> 14:32.881
Well, you can imagine that all the times there were 
great and wonderful things that happened in the

14:27.296 --> 14:32.881
past. People learning to fly. Now it's just a cow 
pasture, or in that case, a horse pasture. And they

14:43.973 --> 14:49.519
had hangers out there that were just unused. And so 
I thought, well, gosh, maybe we could do something

14:52.043 --> 14:57.088
with that facility. Now, there was another 
thought that entered my mind at that time, and that

14:58.048 --> 15:12.622
was that we had gotten the wind tunnel, the big wind 
tunnel, back in operation, and we were working

14:58.048 --> 15:12.622
there. And it occurred to me that if we could have a 
flight lab, that that would give us a very powerful

15:12.642 --> 15:20.869
combination. We could not only do wind tunnel 
tests, but we could take the results of those tests

15:21.035 --> 15:33.706
and flight test them, put them actually on an 
airplane, you see. And the number of

15:33.727 --> 15:41.754
institutions, universities that had that 
capability were very, very limited. Count them

15:42.575 --> 15:46.638
easily on a finger in one hand. And so I thought it 
just might lead to something good. Well, here

15:52.557 --> 16:04.611
again, thank God for Aggie students and their 
unbelievable enthusiasm. And thank God for Key's

16:04.631 --> 16:08.154
money. Because, again, I went to Harry Whitmore 
and laid the idea before him. And I have to tell you

16:13.601 --> 16:21.990
here,

16:13.601 --> 16:21.990
I don't think I have ever gone to Harry Whitmore and 
said, I need this.

16:27.209 --> 16:32.756
And that's, you know, that's just, that's 
unbelievable. I mean, that's incredible.

16:38.343 --> 16:43.289
But in any event, he said, yeah, let's pursue that. 
And so he gave me a little bit of money with which I

16:43.309 --> 16:50.578
could hire some students.

16:50.618 --> 16:50.678
And

16:55.720 --> 17:10.798
So the first thing they did was to, and then Mr. 
Benson went to that for us and got the animal

16:55.720 --> 17:10.798
science people to move their damn fences off the 
runways so we could have access to some of the

16:55.720 --> 17:10.798
runways. And that was not easy to do. Excuse me? 
Were the runways still in good shape? Oh, yeah.

17:18.407 --> 17:19.568
They just had fences across. and uh but but as you 
know the ags run this institution and i guess

17:21.826 --> 17:51.765
always will even

17:21.826 --> 17:51.765
though but but it was not uh it required the clout 
that mr benson had in order to get that get that

17:21.826 --> 17:51.765
airport made back into an airport well we got that 
done and my students had surveyed the the runways

17:21.826 --> 17:51.765
and Some of the older runways were not in very good 
shape, but TTI was using them, so that was okay. But

17:57.509 --> 18:12.388
the two new runways that had been built for jet use 
in the very late 50s, I think, when the Air Force

17:57.509 --> 18:12.388
base was still active, they were in great shape. 
But we were, you know, they looked at the landing

18:12.468 --> 18:17.995
lights and runway lights, whether or not they 
could be used. We might use it in the night, and as

18:18.015 --> 18:21.600
there was no, they'd all be just there. gasoline 
storage facilities and they would pretty much

18:22.357 --> 18:27.082
deteriorate. Things like that. And we had, and 
Harry got us the hangar out there that is currently

18:28.644 --> 18:37.133
the flight lab hangar. And of course it looked like 
it was about to fall down and so we had to have some

18:37.674 --> 18:46.763
structural reinforcement of that hangar and so 
forth. Well, if you're going to have a flight test

18:48.265 --> 18:52.009
facility, it helps to have an airplane. And so I had 
been a pretty successful scrounger of surplus

18:58.761 --> 19:08.051
property. And so here was where the Research 
Foundation came in. And Mr. A.D. Rickett, who is

19:12.296 --> 19:21.205
currently the vice president of the Research 
Foundation, but at that time, he was property

19:12.296 --> 19:21.205
manager of the Research Foundation. And among 
other things, handled all the surplus property.

19:27.225 --> 19:49.232
Well, this got to be a joke, and Rick and I are now 
very close friends, and we still talk about those

19:27.225 --> 19:49.232
days, and he used to get these lists of surplus 
property, and

19:27.225 --> 19:49.232
we would go through those lists, and I got some 
stuff for the shock tube, and I got some things for

19:27.225 --> 19:49.232
the wind tunnel, and And it turned out there was 
occasionally an airplane that would show up.

19:56.088 --> 20:08.099
Well, most of the time they were large airplanes 
and not particularly well suited to research

19:56.088 --> 20:08.099
work.

20:10.581 --> 20:17.768
And that triggers a whole lot of memories. Also, 
keep in mind, again, this was in the mid and late

20:18.575 --> 20:22.941
60s. And we were trying to, the government was 
trying to help the Vietnamese. Well, we had, we

20:33.195 --> 20:38.162
were tracking two airplanes pretty closely. And 
within a course of space of two weeks, these were

20:39.324 --> 20:44.471
surplus airplanes. Within the course of two 
weeks, we lost both of them. because they had

20:48.933 --> 20:56.024
decided that they were going to take anything that 
would fly and pretty much give it to the

20:48.933 --> 20:56.024
Vietnamese. And so here we were with a flight lab 
and some eager students and no airplane. Well, I

21:06.601 --> 21:15.835
had heard from Mr. Bruce, who incidentally 
deserves an awful lot of credit for all of this

21:06.601 --> 21:15.835
because Joe and he had the beginnings of the 
research and instrument shop of the way at that

21:16.523 --> 21:24.237
time. And of course he's, he's, Joe Bruce is an 
absolute genius when it comes to the electro

21:24.257 --> 21:35.839
mechanical part. He is, he is absolutely achieves 
and doesn't get the credit that he deserves, I

21:38.680 --> 21:49.752
think, for what he has contributed to TEAS

21:38.680 --> 21:49.752
and to the College of Engineering. But I knew from 
Joe that

21:50.873 --> 22:05.669
Grumman Aircraft had given us, had given Texas A&M 
the number one and number two Grumman AgCats.

22:05.689 --> 22:08.232
These were airplanes that were built to be crop 
testers. In other words, they were designed from

22:10.637 --> 22:13.781
the ground up as crop testers. They were not 
converted to that use. And back in the early days,

22:17.385 --> 22:30.420
before I came here, as a matter of fact, it was still 
underway when I came here, in the Plant Sciences

22:17.385 --> 22:30.420
Department, there was a crop testing research 
program. They had the, what was it, I think it was

22:30.440 --> 22:37.088
the number two egg that they were flying. 
different kinds of spray apparatus and so forth on

22:37.844 --> 22:46.894
it. But the other airplane, the number one 
airplane, was not flying. And so, well, if you're

22:55.003 --> 23:04.553
going to have an airplane, you better take a look at 
that thing. And so I went out and again, I had talked

23:07.561 --> 23:30.054
with Mr. Whitmore about this, and I said, you know, 
it may be that we'll have to rebuild that just in

23:07.561 --> 23:30.054
order to get something in the air again to how the 
hell could you go to a potential sponsor and

23:07.561 --> 23:30.054
propose research work if you don't even have an 
airplane with which to do it. And so I'll never

23:30.074 --> 23:34.581
forget the The day we went out there,

23:36.265 --> 23:45.618
and Mr. Bruce got his keys, and we went over to a 
warehouse there at the annex. And he opened this

23:46.920 --> 23:55.071
door, and there was this dark, dust-filled room 
laden with junk. And there in the back of the room,

23:56.593 --> 24:02.121
with wings off, no engine, was the fuselage

24:03.704 --> 24:13.514
of the ANCAP.

24:16.737 --> 24:19.539
The wings were stacked up against the wall. And I 
looked at my students, and it was sort of a

24:19.560 --> 24:24.865
reenactment of the deal with the wind tunnel 
model. And I said, folks, if we're going to have a

24:24.885 --> 24:31.932
flight lab, that's going

24:24.885 --> 24:31.932
to be our first research aircraft. Well, there was 
a giant cloud of dust And in about

24:35.125 --> 24:47.377
four to five months, I flew that aircraft that had 
been rebuilt. New engine put in it. The hopper

24:49.640 --> 24:56.086
where the material to be sprayed had been taken 
out. And Mr. Bruce had put a second cockpit in

24:56.647 --> 25:00.851
there. Of course, an open cockpit by plane. And we 
had, I had acquired some surplus research

25:03.307 --> 25:11.701
electronic gear. And we converted that old ag cat 
into a researcher.

25:19.894 --> 25:28.167
And

25:19.894 --> 25:28.167
here again, it was all done with Teasman.

25:29.210 --> 25:37.118
And then we acquired the PA-18 from the Border 
Patrol out of Marfa. And this is a Piper Cub, it's a

25:37.978 --> 25:45.445
Super Cub, so-called, a 150-horse engine.

25:48.268 --> 25:51.771
And so we started with those two airplanes. And so 
we had our airport, we had the hangar, we had two

25:51.791 --> 25:57.597
research airplanes, And we had also had, if you 
visit the flight lab today, you'll see offices

25:58.336 --> 26:07.226
built along one side and in the back there. None of 
that was there. That was, again, all done with T's

26:09.929 --> 26:14.254
money.

26:16.937 --> 26:22.163
And that was the beginning of the flight lab. And 
again, without tease, it just, it simply would not

26:24.813 --> 26:31.403
have happened. It simply wouldn't have happened. 
So... What year was that? I'm sorry? Do you

26:38.453 --> 26:38.954
remember the year? Oh, Lord, honey.

26:44.863 --> 26:47.206
We never had an official dedication. I suppose we 
should have.

26:52.734 --> 26:53.976
I think the flight lab as I recall,

26:54.901 --> 27:05.297
was pretty well in operation by 1967.

27:05.317 --> 27:08.682
We had been doing a few little things prior to that. 
As a matter of fact, I owned an airplane at that

27:09.163 --> 27:18.597
time, and we did a little research with it. But we 
got the AGCAT going, I think, in the spring of 67.

27:27.928 --> 27:33.534
And the PA team came along very, very shortly 
thereafter. And so pretty much by the fall of 67, as

27:33.554 --> 27:46.971
I recall, we were pretty well

27:33.554 --> 27:46.971
in operation. Now, how did, in 72, You became 
associate dean of engineering and director of the

27:50.538 --> 27:56.524
Center for Urban Program. What was the Center for 
Urban Program? Well, it was a strange place for an

28:01.069 --> 28:06.475
engineer to be, I'll tell you. In late 71, after I'd 
come back from Maryland, and in that summer and

28:08.817 --> 28:18.688
fall of 71, and really the spring of 72, That was the 
period of time when I was trying to find Mr. Benson,

28:20.103 --> 28:32.176
pursuing Mr. Benson's directive to seek out some 
new research areas.

28:36.160 --> 28:48.793
In the midst of all that,

28:36.160 --> 28:48.793
well,

28:36.160 --> 28:48.793
again, you have to understand the mood at the time. 
We were deep in the midst of what I call the age of

28:50.090 --> 28:56.077
relevance. Everything that you did had to be 
relevant. It had to serve mankind in a very direct

29:00.223 --> 29:03.246
way. Our students, incidentally, respected that

29:04.908 --> 29:09.915
viewpoint. There was no joy of learning. There was 
no desire to learn anything just for the fun of

29:12.558 --> 29:17.464
learning it. It had to be relevant to something. It 
had to be directly applicable. And the

29:23.539 --> 29:30.427
engineering students of that day, they wanted to 
know just what they needed to know to be

29:23.539 --> 29:30.427
successful. No more, no less, but just what they 
needed. You still see some tinges of that today,

29:35.032 --> 29:43.421
but it's much diminished than what it was. Well, 
the same thing applied to research. And one heard

29:47.498 --> 29:58.493
that during those days, you know, if we can put a man 
on the moon, surely to God we can do blah, blah,

29:47.498 --> 29:58.493
blah. And at that point, in that day and age,

29:59.053 --> 30:15.936
the problems of the urban

29:59.053 --> 30:15.936
areas had come to the fore. A lot of that came out of 
the unrest of the late 60s, and of course the cities

30:17.300 --> 30:26.354
were the focus of that unrest.

30:28.918 --> 30:40.757
And although the unrest had its roots in other 
things, people saw a declining quality of life in

30:28.918 --> 30:40.757
the cities. And of course, in recent years, I guess 
we've seen Demographically, we've seen the

30:44.975 --> 30:54.109
movement

30:44.975 --> 30:54.109
of people out of the cities and into smaller towns 
and rural areas and so on. But there was great

30:54.149 --> 31:04.765
concern at that time for trying to help

30:54.149 --> 31:04.765
the cities. And there was money, federal money, 
available. The National Science Foundation at

31:08.768 --> 31:16.756
that time had developed what they called the RAN 
program, R-A-N-A. And that stood for Research

31:16.776 --> 31:22.322
Applied to the Nation's Needs. And it was an 
interesting

31:22.362 --> 31:27.907
program. And one part of it focused on urban 
problems. And that, you know, that was sort of

31:34.925 --> 31:52.572
unheard of for the National Science Foundation, 
whose province had always been far out in physics,

31:34.925 --> 31:52.572
you know, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and 
some of the far reaches of chemistry and biology

31:34.925 --> 31:52.572
and so forth. And now to get involved in an applied 
research program focused on the cities. Well,

31:59.622 --> 32:02.907
they had some money. And, but in any event, to come 
back to Texas A&M, I was, as I say, in this activity

32:04.152 --> 32:18.644
that Mr. Benson had directed before. I was still 
working on a very broad front. We had started some

32:22.267 --> 32:29.653
stuff in the advanced transportation

32:22.267 --> 32:29.653
area. And the productivity thing was just really 
beginning to take And,

32:34.797 --> 32:46.477
Lord,

32:34.797 --> 32:46.477
I can't think of his name. The guy who was the city 
manager of the city of Dallas for many years. He was

32:48.942 --> 32:53.430
then, at that time, he was an assistant city 
manager. He was an incredible man. I can't

32:54.131 --> 32:59.320
remember his name.

33:02.827 --> 33:08.054
And, of course, by that time, Mr. Rutter had passed 
away, and Dr. Williams was president. And so this

33:09.135 --> 33:16.765
gentleman, almost had his name now, but that's 
about it. This gentleman from the city of Dallas, I

33:18.707 --> 33:25.996
can't remember whether he came down or whether he 
wrote a letter. It seems like he wrote a letter. to

33:28.325 --> 33:45.181
Dr. Williams saying that he thought that Texas A&M 
ought to mount an effort to help the citizens

33:28.325 --> 33:45.181
of the state of

33:28.325 --> 33:45.181
Texas. And so Dr. Williams then asked Mr. Benson, 
and I'm sure the reason that he did that was because

33:45.201 --> 33:56.772
of Tease. Because you see, And this is, again, 
something we haven't touched on, but again, it's

33:59.020 --> 34:05.529
something I'm sure you've heard by now. One of the 
great advantages that TEAS has is its ability to

34:05.549 --> 34:12.219
hang on to some of the indirect cost money. Has that 
issue been explained to you? And other

34:16.004 --> 34:20.370
engineering experiment stations, of course, now 
they don't have. So it's an enormously powerful

34:22.477 --> 34:30.545
tool because of course it is the source of the money 
coupled with the money that they get from the

34:22.477 --> 34:30.545
state. It is the source of the money with which we do 
all these great things that I've been describing

34:31.446 --> 34:42.318
to you. And so TEAS has been called upon by the 
university to start a lot of things. The

34:53.037 --> 35:04.671
cyclotron, the food protein center, and the 
computer system all started from peas and it was

34:53.037 --> 35:04.671
because they had money. And they were the only damn 
ones on the campus that did, pretty much. All the

35:06.994 --> 35:11.119
ags happened when they spent it on ag things, you 
see. But a different, different sack of snakes. I

35:14.102 --> 35:15.484
mean, a lot of people will say, Texas Agricultural 
Experiment Station, Texas Engineering

35:16.105 --> 35:21.051
Experiment Station. Ah, about the same name. It 
must be about the same. Wrong. It was different as

35:24.836 --> 35:26.198
night and day. I wish to hell Perry Atkinson could 
understand that. And that's an editorial

35:29.943 --> 35:32.807
comment, obviously. But the ag folks don't 
understand it.

35:38.915 --> 35:45.403
So Dr. Williams then asked Mr. Benson to pursue 
this initiative. in the urban area. And, of

35:48.110 --> 36:07.597
course, Mr. Benson at that time had this gift by the 
name of Thomas that was supposed to be seeking out

35:48.110 --> 36:07.597
new research things for T's to do, and so he called 
me into his office and said, would you take a look at

35:48.110 --> 36:07.597
this? And so that was the beginning of the second 
form of programs. And so the first thing I did, of

36:11.282 --> 36:14.547
course, not knowing anything about urban 
problems, which I guess later on we saw that as kind

36:15.505 --> 36:28.978
of a blessing because I had no preconceived 
notions about what could be done or what couldn't

36:15.505 --> 36:28.978
be done. But the first thing I did was to take some 
tease money and jump in my airplane and take a

36:31.581 --> 36:43.993
little tour around the state and talk with city 
officials and sound them out on this whole thing.

36:51.242 --> 36:55.086
And generally positive reaction. Some were very 
cautious. Some gave us some advice that was

36:58.670 --> 37:11.263
absolutely invaluable in the later functions of 
the center.

37:12.830 --> 37:26.408
Again, I

37:12.830 --> 37:26.408
could go to those people and say, I have some money

37:12.830 --> 37:26.408
to spend. Well, I came back after that jaunt and 
told Mr. Benson that I thought it was a viable

37:26.428 --> 37:38.263
thing, that I thought we would be relatively well 
received in the cities.

37:40.066 --> 37:47.496
we had some hurdles to surmount.

37:48.137 --> 37:54.606
And that I was relatively sure that with a properly 
constructed program that we could draw federal

37:48.137 --> 37:54.606
support.

37:57.670 --> 38:09.786
And so Mr. Benson went back to Dr. Williams and told 
him that he thought we had the makings of a the

38:10.998 --> 38:18.068
program here, and he thought an organization 
ought to be established to pursue this. And Dr.

38:20.331 --> 38:26.859
Williams said, fine, Mr. Chairman, whom do you 
want on your committee? So he named Benson the

38:26.879 --> 38:31.806
chairman of the oversight committee. And so then 
Mr. Benson called together a group of five, as I

38:31.826 --> 38:38.355
recall, deans, other deans, and But these, of 
course, were the deans of colleges that we thought

38:38.825 --> 38:48.594
we would draw on from, you know, to support that 
urban program. So it

38:48.614 --> 39:05.490
included

38:48.614 --> 39:05.490
liberal arts, and it seems like the ag folks from 
every other company was there, and architecture,

38:48.614 --> 39:05.490
geosciences was there. And I think, yeah, Frank 
Cuban, who was the dean of education at this time.

39:12.411 --> 39:18.359
And so they formed a kind of an oversight group. And 
so rather quickly then, the other things that I had

39:18.379 --> 39:33.280
been pursuing for Mr. Benson sort of went into the 
background. And so we focused our efforts on

39:33.300 --> 39:36.304
these, you know, In the 50s, the 40s,

39:37.752 --> 39:51.529
there had been a lot of research done on 
industrialization

39:37.752 --> 39:51.529
studies and surveys. Had this been going on, and 
did you then pick these things up and take them on,

39:51.549 --> 39:59.098
or did you start totally from scratch? No, dearly. 
Well, keep in mind, we had at that point, we had the

40:01.340 --> 40:07.708
Industrial Economics Research Division here run 
by Jim Bradley. That was still doing this? Oh, yes.

40:09.857 --> 40:10.678
Right. And, as a matter of fact, it was absorbed 
into this center when it was established in 78. But

40:15.284 --> 40:18.168
not into the urban center? No. It functions 
separately, and it dealt with economic

40:18.268 --> 40:21.372
development. No. The focus of the Center for Urban 
Programs was to help cities deliver services more

40:23.095 --> 40:36.092
efficiently and to manage more efficiently. So we 
developed old continuing education programs for

40:37.321 --> 40:44.451
city managers and other subsystem managers. For 
example, it would be of no surprise to you if I told

40:44.471 --> 41:04.138
you that we mounted

40:44.471 --> 41:04.138
a continuing education program for airport 
managers, which was quite successful for its

40:44.471 --> 41:04.138
brief tenure. We embarked on a management 
assistance program, and,

41:04.557 --> 41:18.650
well, we had a lot of things

41:04.557 --> 41:18.650
underway. And here again, at this point, I have to 
throw some more accolades at this pension. When

41:26.777 --> 41:31.982
you start a program from scratch like that, here 
again, without any proven expertise to work in the

41:32.840 --> 41:46.781
area, you have to have money to develop some 
credibility.

41:48.203 --> 41:55.454
And of course I knew that I was to bring money as fast 
as I could. I mean, we didn't want to be on the dole

41:55.474 --> 41:58.438
forever. We didn't want to fees and would be 
dependent on T's money, thought, in tonight. And

42:08.486 --> 42:21.267
so I well remember we were,

42:08.486 --> 42:21.267
see that began in 72, I guess this, this incident 
occurred like in 74 or 5. We had had one or two small

42:22.389 --> 42:27.096
grants to do urban but

42:27.464 --> 42:52.950
I was plainly concerned that this thing wasn't 
developing as fast as I thought it should. And so I

42:52.970 --> 42:55.713
guess on one day when I was a bit down, I went to see 
Mr. Mattson and I said, Skipper, I'm just not sure

42:52.970 --> 42:55.713
what this thing is for. And he listened to my lament 
and And

42:58.160 --> 43:19.849
he said, Dick, he said, you are too worried about 
bringing money. He said, you worry about building

43:19.869 --> 43:20.911
a quality program. And if you do that, the money 
will come. Let me worry about the money. You just

43:22.353 --> 43:23.374
concentrate on building a quality program. Well, 
darling, that's the way it ought

43:26.037 --> 43:32.183
to be done. Again, to be somewhat critical of our 
current T's leadership does

43:32.203 --> 43:41.191
not understand that. So what I'm saying to you is 
that the power, the strength, the sort of grudging

43:41.211 --> 43:53.783
respect that T's currently enjoys in the Texas A&M 
community, and I think in other parts of the state

43:55.028 --> 44:08.923
of the nation, is due largely to the

43:55.028 --> 44:08.923
preferences of you about how to build quality 
programs. You don't build a quality program by

44:08.943 --> 44:16.892
throwing money at it for a year, or even two years. 
His view was that if I had a self-supporting

44:16.912 --> 44:22.318
program within five years, that would be great. 
And if it took eight years, then it just took eight

44:22.535 --> 44:26.440
years. That's all. And you just don't find that 
kind of attitude or the ability to do that, you

44:28.523 --> 44:42.021
know, in other areas or in other institutions. And 
so in any event, interestingly, shortly after

44:42.041 --> 44:51.934
that, very sure within six months of that 
conversation I had with Mr. Benson, things

44:42.041 --> 44:51.934
started to break for us. And again, it was because 
we had TEAS money to go out and do a few things, and I

44:52.336 --> 45:08.626
could go to the RAND program people in NSF, and to 
the HUD people, it was Housing and Urban

44:52.336 --> 45:08.626
Development at that time, and tell them what we had 
done. We had a trash record. I had faculty

45:09.968 --> 45:14.897
identified that had expertise, you see. We had 
gone out and and worked with a few of the cities, and

45:16.501 --> 45:31.323
I'd say, yeah, I know more of the towns than the city 
manager, of course, Christine, and other guys,

45:16.501 --> 45:31.323
and police chiefs, and things like that. And so, 
and again, that was all because of T's money. And

45:35.189 --> 45:44.382
coupled with Mr. Benson's

45:35.189 --> 45:44.382
tremendously important... understanding of 
what it takes to promote and develop these things

45:44.733 --> 46:02.353
and so within within six months after that 
conversation i think we had a backlog of something

45:44.733 --> 46:02.353
like 750 000

45:44.733 --> 46:02.353
we had started we have gotten into the urban 
observatory program
