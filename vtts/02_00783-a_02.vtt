WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:06.963
robotics program came out of our productivity 
program. The industrial engineering department

00:07.604 --> 00:18.374
is now involved in an Air Force effort to set up an 
artificial intelligence program. And a lot of the

00:19.335 --> 00:31.287
advanced manufacturing system work that is 
currently being done by Dr. Don Phillips and

00:19.335 --> 00:31.287
others in industrial engineering had its roots in 
the Park Community. And so, although it does not

00:34.624 --> 00:47.018
exist as such now, it laid the foundation for some 
activities that are currently going on. And

00:47.118 --> 01:01.375
incidentally, here again, the only reason that 
that thing succeeded was that Mr. Benson and Mr.

00:47.118 --> 01:01.375
Whitmore gave me a chunk of T's money with which to 
promote it. And that's the only thing we did. And if

01:06.278 --> 01:13.187
I can tell you just a quick story about that time. 
Dr. Ray Goforth, who at that time was in industrial

01:13.207 --> 01:21.357
engineering, but now is in industrial 
engineering, is in mechanical engineering. And

01:21.377 --> 01:24.762
is a very competent guy. One summer, using T's 
money, we pursued this problem of why weren't

01:28.962 --> 01:50.522
numerically controlled machines showing up, 
particularly in what we call the mom-and-pop

01:28.962 --> 01:50.522
machine shops, the little job shops that, again, 
dot the back alleys

01:28.962 --> 01:50.522
of Houston and Dallas and other large cities. And 
don't misunderstand, they're not always just

01:50.542 --> 01:54.966
real small operations. Some of those things are 
really small. And so with T's money, we did a study

01:58.898 --> 02:09.651
of barriers to the utilization of numerically 
controlled machines in small shops. It turned out

02:11.473 --> 02:17.560
to have been a mere classic. And gave us 
credibility that led to research activities,

02:17.580 --> 02:26.391
research sponsorships. And this is, again, you 
see, the thing that you have to do. You can't take an

02:32.703 --> 02:44.180
outfit that has no track record in a given area and 
go to a sponsor and say, here, give me some money to

02:32.703 --> 02:44.180
do some work in that area. He's going to say, well, 
what the hell have you done? And quite improperly

02:47.125 --> 02:48.306
so. And if you say, well, nothing, but if you give us 
some money, we're going to do something great.

02:55.457 --> 02:56.158
That ain't going to get it. And so we, the money that 
we got from the National Science Foundation came

02:56.645 --> 03:21.792
out of a, really came out of that little study that 
Ray Goforth did for us back in the summer of 77, I

02:56.645 --> 03:21.792
think, or 76, I can't remember.

03:23.797 --> 03:37.070
And it led to an exchange that I had with a guy from 
the National Science Foundation because they had

03:23.797 --> 03:37.070
a productivity program at that time. And the 
interesting thing that came out of our study was

03:37.090 --> 03:48.522
that the reason people weren't using these 
advanced manufacturing systems was because they

03:37.090 --> 03:48.522
were afraid of them. They didn't understand. They 
didn't understand what these devices could do for

03:50.602 --> 04:01.217
them, and they were afraid of what they might do to

03:50.602 --> 04:01.217
them. And Ray's work that summer, and he had a 
couple of students working on it, I thought was

04:01.337 --> 04:09.729
magnificent. And it brought that forth very 
clearly. As it so happened, I went to a meeting

04:15.839 --> 04:24.428
sponsored by the National Science Foundation 
dealing with productivity matters, and they got

04:15.839 --> 04:24.428
into this very issue. Their view, traditional 
Bank of the Potomac's myopia, was that it all

04:26.310 --> 04:33.657
rested on money. If these people just had money, 
they would go buy these machines and use them and so

04:33.677 --> 04:38.963
forth. But hell, it was obvious that that the 
people in Houston, I mean, most of them tied to the

04:42.468 --> 04:52.762
petrochemical industry, making machine parts 
for them, they were laughing all the way at the

04:42.468 --> 04:52.762
bank. I mean, money was anything but a problem. And 
so, as a matter of fact, in this public meeting up in

04:56.868 --> 05:08.965
Rochester, New York, I got into another heated 
discussion with this guy from the National

04:56.868 --> 05:08.965
Science Center, who was a friend, was and is a 
friend. So I told him, we've got data to dispute

05:09.670 --> 05:12.933
that. And so he said, I want to see that. And so he did 
see it, and that led to a lot of things.

05:25.425 --> 05:38.277
We eventually got involved in the Air Force's ICAM

05:25.425 --> 05:38.277
program, the Integrated Manufacturing Program, 
largely because they were concerned about

05:25.425 --> 05:38.277
technology transfer.

05:38.915 --> 05:47.569
Because of this little rigging study that we had 
done, we're sort of nationally recognized

05:38.915 --> 05:47.569
experts on technology transfer. But it's just an 
indication, again, of the power of just a little

05:48.811 --> 05:55.702
bit of tea's winning. And again, if it hadn't been 
there, we wouldn't have done it. Let's go back to

06:01.392 --> 06:06.119
the flight land in 1964. Oh, okay. Before we move on 
farther. Yeah, okay, back to the 60s then.

06:14.891 --> 06:29.813
Well, of course I had naturally, when I came here in 
64, having been involved in hypersonic and

06:14.891 --> 06:29.813
reentry research associated with the space 
program at that time, And I don't think, you know,

06:30.383 --> 06:44.959
at that time we couldn't foresee that as soon as the 
Apollo program had been successful that

06:30.383 --> 06:44.959
everything was going to go downhill. We just, you 
know, we thought that investing in space-type

06:46.441 --> 06:54.450
research was a heck of a good thing to do. So I was 
obviously interested in promoting that when I

06:55.342 --> 07:04.350
came down here.

07:05.752 --> 07:08.654
And I was primarily an experimentalist. I hadn't 
done a lot of theoretical work. It was mostly

07:11.998 --> 07:18.103
wind tone work and making those experiments. Of 
course, we didn't have a hypersonic facility

07:18.123 --> 07:22.007
here. And so it seemed as though that the most 
inexpensive facility that we could develop was a

07:23.067 --> 07:40.634
shock tube, which is a device that will create 
hypersonic flows for very, very short periods of

07:23.067 --> 07:40.634
time. And basically, you have this large tube, and 
you create a very high pressure shock wave that

07:41.335 --> 07:51.471
rushes down the tube and pulls the air

07:53.020 --> 07:55.963
behind it, with it, at very high speeds. And so you 
can do some good... Back in those days, of course,

07:56.403 --> 08:11.318
the work that needed to be done was very, very basic 
work.

08:12.900 --> 08:16.744
Because aerodynamics was in a completely new 
realm. Normally, of course, air is nitrogen and

08:18.806 --> 08:21.188
oxygen. N2 and O2, both diatomic molecules, 
principally. Well, those molecules, in addition

08:27.204 --> 08:44.187
to bouncing off one another like billiard balls, 
the individual atoms in the molecule vibrate.

08:44.207 --> 08:48.012
There is an intermolecular bond based on largely 
the electronic attraction that holds them

08:44.207 --> 08:48.012
together. But when you talk about a reentry 
theory, coming, whistling back into the

08:51.172 --> 08:56.619
atmosphere at very, very high speeds. It has a 
shockwave event. There's a temperature jump

08:59.983 --> 09:04.349
across that shockwave. There's a temperature 
jump across any shockwave, even though it might

09:04.509 --> 09:12.580
be, you know, if you have a Mach 2 fighter, or a 
Concorde, you know, anything. But when you talk

09:12.680 --> 09:15.323
about Mach 2 or Mach 20, The temperature joke is so 
great that it causes those molecules, those

09:15.927 --> 09:24.476
atoms, to cause the molecules to dissociate. And 
so you have a chemical reaction. The M2 becomes 2N.

09:30.963 --> 09:32.885
The same thing for oxygen. So this air, or this gas 
behind this shock wave, is no longer air. It's some

09:37.490 --> 09:41.654
weird new gas. And the fact that that structure has 
changed makes it, made it very difficult to

09:46.285 --> 09:53.973
predict the lift and drag of things like the 
Mercury capsule. If you recall the early Mercury

09:54.874 --> 10:03.623
flights, some of them, there was one, who flew 
that? I can't remember. I think it was the third

10:04.004 --> 10:05.986
flight. The guy landed miles from the touchdown 
point. And the principal reason there was Of

10:14.821 --> 10:20.471
course, he was flying at somewhat the wrong angle 
of attack coming back in. But nonetheless, our

10:21.833 --> 10:30.568
inability to predict lift and drag was very great. 
largely because we just didn't understand this

10:31.156 --> 10:49.655
strange new and then the ionization blackout, you 
know, where even though the temperatures were so

10:31.156 --> 10:49.655
high that the electrons would peel off of these 
atoms and create this sheath of ions behind it, and

10:31.156 --> 10:49.655
the radio wave wouldn't penetrate it. So we had 
that ionization blackout period going on. And so

10:53.999 --> 10:59.965
all of that stuff at that time was, God, that was 
just, that was way out stuff. And so shock tubes

11:00.805 --> 11:08.572
could create shock waves strong enough to cause 
those chemical reactions. And so we could study

11:08.592 --> 11:11.094
them. And so, again, good old teams and good old 
Harry Whitmore gave me,

11:11.114 --> 11:30.572
I can't remember, I think it was $40,000 or 
$50,000, I think, to build a shock tube. And we did.

11:31.197 --> 11:47.692
And again,

11:31.197 --> 11:47.692
that was the foundation for some research work, 
and which, again, simply would not have happened

11:31.197 --> 11:47.692
had we not gotten that money for TEEs. Well, so the 
shock tube lab, and we had a building given to us out

11:47.712 --> 11:55.699
at the annex. It wasn't much of a building, but it 
worked out extremely well.

12:06.709 --> 12:12.076
And then, too, we had another strange event 
happen. At about 65 or 66,

12:12.096 --> 12:27.816
some students came to me and said, well, the 
traditional areas of activity or specialization

12:12.096 --> 12:27.816
within of aerospace engineering are 
aerodynamics,

12:28.353 --> 12:47.951
which has

12:28.353 --> 12:47.951
to do with the flow of air about these mines, 
structures, making them strong enough but light

12:28.353 --> 12:47.951
enough that they'll fly, and propulsion, which 
deals with engines and power plants, and that sort

12:28.353 --> 12:47.951
of thing. But the fourth area is flight mechanics, 
which deals with the entire vehicle. It deals with

12:52.535 --> 12:55.778
stability and control and performance 
maneuverability and that sort of thing. And so,

13:00.061 --> 13:07.891
some students came to me and said, you know, they 
were interested in more inflective things.

13:07.911 --> 13:14.620
Wasn't there anything we could do to get active in 
that area? Well, here we were with a beautiful

13:15.321 --> 13:21.309
facility. The old Bryan Air Force Base parallel 
7,500 foot runways. And at

13:30.532 --> 13:44.329
that time, we had horses running over those 
runways. To me, being one who has been hooked on

13:44.349 --> 13:53.980
airplanes for many, many years, I think the 
saddest thing that one can see is an abandoned

13:44.349 --> 13:53.980
airplane, an airplane that there's a relic

13:54.753 --> 14:15.515
that's just uncared for

13:54.753 --> 14:15.515
sitting on the corner of an airport or in a hangar 
and just falling.

14:15.535 --> 14:17.758
And you think that at one time it must have been a 
beautiful sight in flight. And there it sits,

14:17.778 --> 14:21.182
rusting and deteriorating. The second saddest 
thing I think it's an abandoned airport.

14:27.342 --> 14:33.350
Well, you could imagine that all the times there 
were great and wonderful things that happened in

14:27.342 --> 14:33.350
the past. People learning to fly. Now it's just a 
cow pasture,

14:36.573 --> 14:43.942
or in that case, a horse pasture. And they had 
hangers out there that were just unused. And so, I

14:52.027 --> 14:58.015
thought, well, gosh, maybe we could do something 
with that facility. Now, there was another

14:58.035 --> 15:11.013
thought that entered my mind at that time, and that 
was that we had gotten the wind tunnel, the big wind

14:58.035 --> 15:11.013
tunnel, back in operation, and we were working 
there. And it occurred to me that if we could have a

15:12.615 --> 15:18.844
sweat lab, that that would give us a very powerful 
combination. we could not only do wind tunnel

15:20.225 --> 15:31.099
tests, but we could take the results of those tests 
and flight test them. Put them actually on an

15:31.119 --> 15:33.703
airplane, you see. And the number of 
institutions, universities that had that

15:33.723 --> 15:41.734
capability were very, very limited. Count them 
easily on a finger and one hand. And so I thought, It

15:48.457 --> 15:52.643
just might lead to something good. Well, here 
again, thank God for Aggie students and their

15:52.663 --> 16:04.598
unbelievable enthusiasm. And thank God for Key's 
money. Because, again, I went to Harry Whitmore

16:08.123 --> 16:13.550
and laid the idea before him. And I have to tell you, 
dear,

16:17.684 --> 16:29.020
I don't think I have ever gone to Harry Woodward and

16:17.684 --> 16:29.020
said, I need this. And that's just unbelievable. I 
mean, that's incredible.

16:38.334 --> 16:43.261
But in any event, he said, yeah, let's pursue that. 
And so he gave me a little bit of money with which I

16:43.281 --> 16:47.607
could hire some students. And

16:49.510 --> 17:10.769
so the first thing they did was to, and then Mr. 
Benson went to that for us and got the animal

16:49.510 --> 17:10.769
science people to move their damn fences off the 
runways so we could have access to some of the

16:49.510 --> 17:10.769
runways. And that was not easy to do. Excuse me? 
Were the runways still in good shape? Oh, yeah.

17:17.375 --> 17:17.515
Uh-huh. Yeah. They just had fences across them.

17:23.923 --> 17:32.895
But as you know, the Ags run this institution, and I 
guess always will, even though...

17:35.238 --> 17:36.840
But it was not... It required the clout that Mr. 
Benson had in order to get that airport made back

17:37.601 --> 17:44.290
into an airport. Well, we got that done, and my 
students had surveyed the runways, and some of the

17:46.126 --> 17:57.460
older runways were not in very good shape, but TTI 
was using them, so that was okay. But the two new

17:57.480 --> 18:11.256
runways that had been built for jet use in the very 
late 50s, I think, when the Air Force Base was still

17:57.480 --> 18:11.256
active, they were in great shape. But we were, you 
know, they looked at the landing lights and runway

18:12.063 --> 18:17.950
lights, whether or not they could be used. We might 
use them at night. The answer there was no. They'd

18:20.433 --> 18:27.081
all be just in gasoline storage facilities, and 
they would pretty much deteriorate. Things like

18:27.101 --> 18:27.802
that. And we had, and Harry got us the hangar out 
there that is currently the flight lab hangar.

18:37.493 --> 18:48.208
And, of course, it looked like it was about to fall 
down, and so we had to have some structural

18:37.493 --> 18:48.208
reinforcement of that hangar and so forth. Well, 
if you're going to have a flight test facility, it

18:48.228 --> 18:57.541
helps to have an airplane. And so I had been a pretty 
successful scrounger of surplus property. And so

19:07.447 --> 19:27.109
here was where the Research Foundation came in, 
and Mr. A.D. Rickett, who is currently the Vice

19:07.447 --> 19:27.109
President of the Research Foundation, but at that 
time he was property manager of the Research

19:07.447 --> 19:27.109
Foundation, and among other things, handled all 
the surplus property. Well, this got to be a joke,

19:27.149 --> 19:33.977
and Rick and I are now very close friends, and we 
still talk about those days, he used to get these

19:34.700 --> 19:39.185
lists of surplus property. And

19:39.385 --> 19:56.105
we would go through those lists, and I got some 
stuff for the shock tube, and I got some things for

19:39.385 --> 19:56.105
the wind tunnel, and it turned out there was 
occasionally an airplane that would show up.

19:56.125 --> 20:03.053
Well, most of the time they were large airplanes, 
and not particularly well suited to to research

20:03.877 --> 20:08.123
with.

20:10.907 --> 20:15.253
And that triggers a whole lot of memories. But

20:15.653 --> 20:24.606
also keep in mind, again, this was mid and late 60s.

20:26.588 --> 20:33.478
And we were trying to, the government was trying to 
help the Vietnamese. We had, we were tracking two

20:34.471 --> 20:38.154
airplanes pretty closely. And within, of course, 
a space of two weeks, these were surplus

20:39.276 --> 20:45.001
airplanes. Within the course of two weeks, we lost 
both of them because they had decided that they

20:45.061 --> 20:55.991
were going to take anything that would fly and 
pretty much give it to the Vietnamese. And so here

20:57.212 --> 21:03.178
we were with a flight lab and some eager students 
and no airplanes. Well, I had heard from Mr. Bruce,

21:05.082 --> 21:24.302
who incidentally deserves an awful lot of credit 
for all of this, because Joe, and he had the

21:05.082 --> 21:24.302
beginnings of the research and instrument shop on 
the way at that time. And, of course, he's, he's,

21:24.322 --> 21:34.212
Joe Bruce is an absolute genius when it comes to the 
electromechanical department. He is absolutely

21:35.744 --> 21:52.525
a genius, and doesn't get the credit that he 
deserves, I think, for what he has contributed to

21:35.744 --> 21:52.525
TEAS

21:35.744 --> 21:52.525
and to the College of Engineering. But I knew from 
Joe that

21:52.545 --> 22:03.979
Grumman Aircraft had given us, had given Texas A&M 
the number one and number two rum and egg cats.

22:05.636 --> 22:10.561
These were airplanes that were built to be crop 
dusters. In other words, they were designed from

22:10.581 --> 22:13.723
the ground up as crop dusters. They were not 
converted to that use. And back in the early days

22:17.367 --> 22:32.059
before I came here, as a matter of fact it was still 
underway when I came here, in the plant sciences

22:17.367 --> 22:32.059
department there was a crop dusting research 
program. They had the was that I think it was the

22:33.271 --> 22:36.576
number two aircraft that they were flying. They 
had different kinds of spray apparatus and so

22:36.616 --> 22:46.731
forth on

22:36.616 --> 22:46.731
them. But the other airplane, the number one 
airplane, was not flying. And so, well, if you're

22:54.582 --> 23:03.075
going to have an airplane, you better take a look at 
that thing. I went out, and again, I had talked with

23:03.545 --> 23:30.084
Mr. Whitmore about this, and I said, you know, it 
may be that we'll have to rebuild that just in order

23:03.545 --> 23:30.084
to get something in the air again to, you know, how 
the hell could you go to a potential sponsor and

23:03.545 --> 23:30.084
propose research work if you don't even have an 
airplane with which to do it? And so I'd I'll never

23:33.565 --> 23:45.580
forget the day we went out there and

23:33.565 --> 23:45.580
Mr. Bruce got his keys and we went over to a 
warehouse there at the annex. And he opened this

23:46.982 --> 23:55.052
door and there was this dark, dust-filled room 
laden with junk. And there in the back of the room,

23:56.594 --> 24:02.121
with wings off, no engine, was the fuselage of the

24:03.670 --> 24:11.161
ANCAT. The wings

24:11.201 --> 24:18.311
were stacked up against the wall. And I looked at my 
students and there was sort of a reenactment of the

24:18.331 --> 24:24.039
deal with the wind tunnel model. And I said, folks, 
if we're going to have a flight lab,

24:24.059 --> 24:31.890
that's going to be our first research aircraft. 
Well, there was a giant cloud of dust And in about

24:35.092 --> 24:47.191
four or five months, I flew that aircraft that had 
been rebuilt. A new engine put in it. The hopper

24:49.695 --> 24:56.807
where the material to be sprayed had been taken 
out. And Mr. Bruce had put a second cockpit in

24:56.827 --> 25:00.492
there. Of course, an open cockpit by plane. And we 
had, I had acquired some surplus research

25:03.290 --> 25:12.880
electronic gear, surplus electronic gear to put 
in there. And we converted that old ag cat into a

25:12.900 --> 25:19.607
researcher.

25:23.331 --> 25:28.116
And here again, it was all done with tees money. And 
then we acquired the PA-18 from the Border Patrol

25:29.193 --> 25:37.081
out of Marfa. And this is a Piper Cub. It's a Super 
Cub, so-called, with a 150-horse engine.

25:48.253 --> 25:51.737
And so we started with those two airplanes. And so 
we had our airport. We had the hangar. We had two

25:54.680 --> 25:57.563
research airplanes. And we had also had, if you 
visit the flight lab today, you'll see offices

25:58.302 --> 26:07.212
built along one side and in the back there. None of 
that was there. That was, again, all done with T's

26:09.895 --> 26:15.982
money.

26:16.903 --> 26:19.326
And that was the beginning of the flight lab. And

26:20.187 --> 26:23.871
again, without tease, it just, it simply would not 
have happened.

26:32.608 --> 26:34.671
It simply wouldn't have happened. So... What year 
was that? Do you remember? I'm sorry? Do you

26:38.656 --> 26:39.157
remember the year? Oh, Lord, honey. Late 60s?

26:44.826 --> 26:47.169
We never had an official dedication. I suppose we 
should have.

26:52.697 --> 26:53.959
I think the flight lab as I recall,

26:54.867 --> 27:01.738
was pretty well in operation by 67. We had

27:01.758 --> 27:08.530
been doing a few little things prior to that. As a 
matter of fact, I owned an airplane at that time,

27:08.550 --> 27:18.546
and we did a little research with it. But we got the 
AGCAT going, I think, in the spring of 67. And the

27:27.891 --> 27:31.515
PA-18 came along very, very shortly thereafter. 
And so pretty much by the fall of 67, as I recall, we

27:33.538 --> 27:46.875
were pretty well

27:33.538 --> 27:46.875
in operation. Now, how did, in 72, became 
associate dean of engineering and director of the

27:50.538 --> 27:58.029
Center for Urban Programs. What was the Center for 
Urban Programs? Well, it was a strange place for an

28:01.894 --> 28:06.461
engineer to be, I'll tell you. In late 71, after I'd 
come back from Maryland, and in that summer and

28:08.824 --> 28:18.638
fall of 71, and really the spring of 72, That was the 
period of time when I was trying to find Mr. Benson,

28:20.086 --> 28:34.701
pursuing Mr. Benson's directive to seek out some 
new research areas.

28:36.142 --> 28:48.675
In the midst of all that,

28:36.142 --> 28:48.675
well,

28:36.142 --> 28:48.675
again, you have to understand the mood at the time. 
We were deep in the midst of what I call the age of

28:50.107 --> 28:56.056
relevance. Everything that you did had to be 
relevant. You had to serve mankind in a very direct

29:00.162 --> 29:03.246
way. Our students, incidentally, respected that

29:04.889 --> 29:09.876
viewpoint. There was no joy of learning. There was 
no desire to learn anything, just for the fun of

29:12.540 --> 29:17.447
learning it. It had to be relevant to something. It 
had to be directly applicable. And the

29:23.525 --> 29:30.413
engineering students of that day, they wanted to 
know just what they needed to know to be

29:23.525 --> 29:30.413
successful. No more, no less, but just what they 
needed. You still see some tinges of that today,

29:34.978 --> 29:43.268
but it's much diminished than what it was. Well, 
the same thing applied to research. And one heard

29:47.482 --> 29:59.018
that during those days, you know, if we can put a man 
on the moon, surely to God we can do blah, blah,

29:47.482 --> 29:59.018
blah. And at that point, in that day and age,

29:59.038 --> 30:15.902
the problems of the urban

29:59.038 --> 30:15.902
areas had come to the fore. a lot of that came out of 
the unrest of the late 60s and of course the cities

30:17.266 --> 30:44.623
were the focus of that unrest and although the 
unrest had its roots in other things people saw a

30:17.266 --> 30:44.623
declining quality of life in the cities and of 
course in recent years I guess we've seen

30:44.941 --> 30:54.095
Demographically, we've seen the movement

30:44.941 --> 30:54.095
of people out in the cities and in smaller towns and 
rural areas and so on. But there was great concern

30:54.115 --> 31:04.712
at that time for trying to help

30:54.115 --> 31:04.712
the cities. And there was money, federal money, 
available. The National Science Foundation at

31:08.752 --> 31:22.292
that time had developed what they called the RAN 
program, R-A-N-N. And that stood for Research

31:08.752 --> 31:22.292
Applied to the Nation's Needs. And it was an 
interesting

31:22.632 --> 31:29.282
program. And one part of it focused on urban 
problems. And that, you know, that was sort of

31:34.891 --> 31:52.556
unheard of for the National Science Foundation, 
whose province had always been far out of physics,

31:34.891 --> 31:52.556
you know, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and 
some of the far reaches of chemistry and biology

31:34.891 --> 31:52.556
and so forth. And now to get involved in an applied 
research program focused on the cities. Well,

31:59.585 --> 32:02.890
they had some money. And, uh, but in any event, to 
come back to Texas A&M, uh, uh, I was, uh, as I say, in

32:04.118 --> 32:19.991
this, uh, activity that Mr. Benson had directed 
before. Uh, still working on the harry bar up

32:20.011 --> 32:22.213
front. We had started some stuff in the

32:22.233 --> 32:30.020
advanced transportation area. And, uh, and the 
productivity thing was just really beginning to,

32:30.200 --> 32:33.703
uh, to take with the, And

32:34.780 --> 32:43.452
Lord, I can't think of his name. The guy who was the 
city manager of the city of Dallas for many years.

32:48.659 --> 32:57.752
He was then, at that time, he was

32:48.659 --> 32:57.752
an assistant city manager. He was an incredible 
man. I can't remember his name.

33:02.793 --> 33:09.405
And, of course, by that time, Mr. Rutter had passed 
away, and Dr. Williams was president. And so this

33:09.425 --> 33:18.662
gentleman, almost had his name there, but that's 
about it. This gentleman from the city of Dallas, I

33:18.682 --> 33:25.654
can't remember whether he came down or whether he 
wrote a letter. It seems like he wrote a letter. to

33:28.325 --> 33:42.018
Dr. Williams, saying that he thought that Texas 
A&M ought to mount an effort to help the citizens of

33:28.325 --> 33:42.018
the state of Texas. And so Dr. Williams then asked 
Mr. Benson, and I'm sure the reason that he did that

33:42.038 --> 33:56.772
was because of Tease. Because, you see, And this 
is, again, something we haven't touched on, but

33:59.003 --> 34:05.492
again, it's something I'm sure you've heard by 
now. One of the great advantages that TEAS has is

34:05.512 --> 34:14.865
its ability to hang on to some of the indirect cost 
money that has that issue been explained to you.

34:15.987 --> 34:20.353
And other engineering experiment stations, 
incidentally, don't have. So it's an enormously

34:22.460 --> 34:31.530
powerful tool because, of course, it is the source 
of the money, coupled with the money that they get

34:22.460 --> 34:31.530
from the state. It is the source of the money with 
which to do all these great things that I've been

34:31.590 --> 34:42.281
describing to you. And so TEAS has been called upon 
by the university to start a lot of things. you

34:53.020 --> 35:04.382
know, the cyclotron, the food protein center, the 
computer system, all started from peas and it was

34:53.020 --> 35:04.382
because they had money. They were the only damn 
ones on the campus that did, pretty much. All the

35:07.027 --> 35:11.496
ags happened when they spent it on ag things, you 
see. But a different, different sack of snakes. I

35:14.101 --> 35:15.484
mean, a lot of people will say, Texas Agricultural 
Experiment Station, Texas Engineering

35:16.072 --> 35:21.018
Experiment Station. Ah, about the same name. It 
must be about the same. Wrong. It was different as

35:24.782 --> 35:26.163
night and day. I wish to help Perry Atkinson could 
understand that. And that's an editorial

35:29.928 --> 35:32.771
comment, obviously. But the ag folks don't 
understand it. And

35:35.514 --> 35:45.285
so Dr. Williams then asked Mr. Benson to pursue 
this initiative. in the urban area. And of course,

35:48.096 --> 36:07.586
Mr. Benson at that time had this gift by the name of 
Thomas that was supposed to be seeking out new

35:48.096 --> 36:07.586
research things for T's to do, and so he called me 
into his office and said, would you take a look at

35:48.096 --> 36:07.586
this? And so that was the beginning of the Center 
for Urban Programs. And so the first thing I did, of

36:11.773 --> 36:14.597
course not knowing anything, about urban 
problems which i guess later on we saw that as kind

36:15.438 --> 36:44.010
of a blessing because i had no preconceived 
notions about what could be done or what couldn't

36:15.438 --> 36:44.010
be done but the first thing i did was to take some t's 
money and jump in my airplane and take a little tour

36:15.438 --> 36:44.010
around the state and talk with city officials and 
sound them out on this whole thing. And generally

36:51.767 --> 36:55.051
positive reaction. Some were very cautious. Some 
gave us some advice that was absolutely

36:58.655 --> 37:11.230
invaluable in the later functions of the Center 
for Academic Programs. Again, I

37:12.830 --> 37:26.390
could go to those people and say, I have some money

37:12.830 --> 37:26.390
to spend. Well, I came back after that jaunt and 
told Mr. Benson that I thought it was a viable

37:26.410 --> 37:38.247
thing, that I thought we would be relatively well 
received in the cities.

37:40.049 --> 37:47.477
we had some hurdles to

37:40.049 --> 37:47.477
surmount. And that I was relatively sure that with 
a properly constructed program that we could draw

37:48.118 --> 37:57.628
federal support.

37:57.648 --> 38:09.381
And so Mr. Benson went back to Dr. Williams and told 
him that he thought we had the makings of a the

38:10.930 --> 38:38.305
program here and he thought an organization ought 
to be established to pursue this and dr williams

38:10.930 --> 38:38.305
said fine mr chairman whom do you want on your 
committee so he named benson the chairman of the

38:10.930 --> 38:38.305
oversight committee and so then mr benson called 
together a group of five as i recall deans other

38:10.930 --> 38:38.305
deans and But these, of course, were the deans of 
colleges that we thought we would draw on from, you

38:38.808 --> 38:49.600
know, to support that urban program. So

38:50.040 --> 39:03.175
it included

38:50.040 --> 39:03.175
liberal arts, and it seems like the ag folks were 
there. Yeah, Dr. Kunkel was there, and

39:03.195 --> 39:05.457
architecture, geosciences was there. And I 
think, yeah, Frank Cuban, who was the dean of

39:06.787 --> 39:12.372
education, was there. And so they formed a kind of 
an oversight group. And so rather quickly then,

39:18.357 --> 39:33.251
the other things that I had been pursuing for Mr. 
Benson sort of went into the background. And so we

39:33.271 --> 39:36.574
focused our efforts on these. In the 50s, 40s and 
50s, there had been a lot of research done on

39:37.735 --> 39:51.508
industrialization of cities and surveys and that 
type of thing. Had this been going on, and did you

39:51.528 --> 39:59.076
then pick these things up and take them on, or did 
you start totally from scratch? No, dearly. Well,

40:01.318 --> 40:07.624
keep in mind, we had at that point, we had the 
Industrial Economics Research Division here run

40:01.318 --> 40:07.624
by Jim Bradley. That was still doing those? Oh yes, 
right. And as a matter of fact, it was absorbed into

40:10.658 --> 40:14.683
this center when it was established in 78. But not 
into the urban center? No. It functioned

40:18.228 --> 40:21.332
separately and it dealt with economic 
development. No, the focus of the Center for Urban

40:22.133 --> 40:33.208
Programs was to help cities deliver services more 
efficiently.

40:33.569 --> 40:36.092
And to manage more efficiently. So we developed 
old continuing education programs for city

40:37.287 --> 40:44.435
managers and other subsystem managers. For 
example, it would be of no surprise to you if I told

40:44.455 --> 41:04.037
you that we mounted a continuing education 
program for airport managers, which was quite

40:44.455 --> 41:04.037
successful for its brief tenure. We embarked on a 
management assistance program, and,

41:04.557 --> 41:18.610
well, we had a lot of things underway. And here 
again, at this point, I have to throw some more

41:19.210 --> 41:26.737
accolades at this pension. When you start a 
program from scratch like that, Here again,

41:32.806 --> 41:46.745
without any proven expertise to work in the area, 
you have to have money to develop some

41:32.806 --> 41:46.745
credibility.

41:48.167 --> 41:55.417
And of course, I knew that I was to bring money as 
fast as I could. I mean, we didn't want to be on the

41:55.437 --> 41:59.843
dole forever.

42:00.717 --> 42:08.407
be using, be dependent on Pease money, uh, thought 
infinitely. And, uh, so I well remember we were,

42:08.427 --> 42:21.203
uh, see that began in 72, I guess this, uh, this 
incident occurred like in 74 or 5. We had had one or

42:22.364 --> 42:25.408
two small grants, uh, to

42:25.760 --> 42:45.565
do urban work, but I was plainly concerned that 
this thing wasn't developing as fast as I thought

42:25.760 --> 42:45.565
it should. And so I guess on one day when I was a bit 
down, I went to see Mr. Batson and I said, Skipper,

42:45.585 --> 42:48.308
I'm just not sure what this thing is for.

42:53.080 --> 43:16.065
He

42:53.080 --> 43:16.065
listened to my lament and he said, Dick, you are too 
worried about bringing money home. He said, you

43:16.085 --> 43:17.126
worry about building a quality program. And if you 
do that, the money will come. Let me worry about the

43:17.967 --> 43:18.548
money. you just concentrate on

43:20.789 --> 43:26.418
building a quality building. Well, darling, 
that's the way it ought to

43:26.438 --> 43:32.187
be done. Again, to be somewhat critical of our 
current tease, leadership

43:32.207 --> 43:43.866
does not understand that the way Mr. Benson 
understood it. So what I'm saying to you is that the

43:43.886 --> 43:47.792
power, the strength, The sort of grudging respect 
that TEAS currently enjoys in the Texas A&M

43:48.785 --> 44:08.932
community, and I think in other parts of the state 
and the nation, is due largely to the

43:48.785 --> 44:08.932
preferences of you about how to build quality 
programs. You don't build a quality program by

44:08.952 --> 44:12.717
throwing money at it for a year.

44:16.814 --> 44:22.682
His view was that if I had a self-supporting 
program within five years, that would be great.

44:22.702 --> 44:26.528
And if it took eight years, then it just took eight 
years. That's all. And you just don't find that

44:28.510 --> 44:41.629
kind of attitude or the ability to do that in other 
areas or in other institutions. And so in any

44:41.649 --> 44:46.095
event, interestingly, shortly after that, Very 
sure, within six months of that conversation I had

44:46.480 --> 44:51.624
with Mr. Benson, things started to break for us. 
And again, it was because we'd had teased money to

44:52.505 --> 45:08.599
go out and do a few things, and I could go to the RAND 
program people in NSF, and to the HUD people, it was

44:52.505 --> 45:08.599
Housing and Urban Development at that time, and 
tell them what we had done. We had a trash record. I

45:09.940 --> 45:14.864
had faculty identified that had expertise, you 
see. We had gone out and and worked with a few of the

45:16.484 --> 45:32.186
cities, and I'd say, yeah, I know Marvin Townsend, 
the city manager at Fox, Christine, and other

45:16.484 --> 45:32.186
guys, you know, and police chiefs, and things like 
that. And so, and again, that was all because of T's

45:32.206 --> 45:33.748
money. And coupled with Mr. Benson's

45:33.768 --> 45:44.162
tremendously important... understanding of 
what it takes to promote and develop these things.

45:49.944 --> 45:59.044
And so within six months after that conversation, 
I think we had a backlog of something like $750,000

45:49.944 --> 45:59.044
worth of research. We had started, we had gotten 
into the Urban Observatory Program,
