WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:03.241
In alcohol?

00:03.261 --> 00:03.863
In alcohol.

00:03.883 --> 00:04.063
Yeah.

00:04.746 --> 00:08.498
And then we had, we got these tapes from the University of Texas.

00:08.658 --> 00:12.471
They had authored them and we changed some of the content.

00:12.755 --> 00:17.861
I went to John once and I said, you know, we have a tape on premature ejaculation.

00:19.323 --> 00:24.149
And John said to me, is that a problem that students sometimes talk with you about?

00:24.229 --> 00:34.562
And I said, yeah, students talk to us about sexual concerns, particularly in those days because the health center was much more conservative about birth control and all those things.

00:34.682 --> 00:37.926
And we actually did get into, quote, plumbing.

00:37.946 --> 00:39.488
We probably shouldn't have, but we did.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.802
But John said, is that a student problem?

00:41.822 --> 00:43.143
Is that something suitable?

00:43.163 --> 00:46.787
I said, yeah, occasionally, not overwhelmingly, but occasionally.

00:46.807 --> 00:51.351
He said, well, if that's a student problem, then we ought to address it.

00:51.692 --> 00:54.374
And so that was very relieving.

00:54.414 --> 01:05.205
Now, I also remember before the gay, lesbian, bisexual student group was recognized at the university, though, we did play the politically conservative role

01:06.299 --> 01:15.917
take the position of calling it alternative lifestyles, and that's the way the group was advertised rather than gay, lesbian, bisexual.

01:15.957 --> 01:17.180
It was a euphemism.

01:17.761 --> 01:21.608
In hindsight, was that a prudent course?

01:22.246 --> 01:23.147
Yeah, I think it was.

01:23.568 --> 01:24.209
I really do.

01:24.229 --> 01:32.762
It wasn't the most honest course, but from a transitory perspective, I think it was the right transitory thing to do.

01:32.802 --> 01:44.220
As soon as that lawsuit was taken care of in Houston and all that, and that group was recognized, then we began labeling the group exactly what it was.

01:44.690 --> 01:54.540
And that was very interesting because before that group was recognized, we had at least two gay lesbian groups running in the center every week.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.663
As soon as they were recognized, it dropped off to none.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.587
It just changed.

02:00.627 --> 02:03.750
The students did not use us to the degree that they had.

02:03.770 --> 02:09.516
There was something about the impact of finally, I guess they're being legitimatized.

02:09.783 --> 02:14.049
When you said running, you mean coming to... We ran them.

02:14.670 --> 02:17.474
One meeting, two groups, one time a week, yeah.

02:17.494 --> 02:18.535
Running those groups, yeah.

02:18.976 --> 02:19.257
Right.

02:20.078 --> 02:20.358
Right.

02:20.779 --> 02:21.660
So that was interesting.

02:24.784 --> 02:38.524
I always remember, tangentially, John Koldis coming back from being spoken to by the federal district judge down in Houston, and we used to debate whether in loco parentis was alive or not, and we were all thinking, well, it was fairly dead, you know, and all that.

02:39.078 --> 02:51.738
I remember John coming back and said the judge was very clear, Dr. Koldis, you are responsible for what that then 37,000 do and do not do, you know, and he said in loco parentis lives in the federal court.

02:53.201 --> 03:00.833
As far as you were aware during the 80s, we'll say,

03:02.483 --> 03:10.653
Were your professional colleagues on other campuses aware of the quality of the program here?

03:11.494 --> 03:13.737
Yeah.

03:15.158 --> 03:30.837
I think because I engaged in making a number of presentations at a variety of professional organizations and as more of our staff began doing the same thing, yeah, there's no question that our staff

03:31.475 --> 03:42.090
in a very comparatively short period of time has just moved the reputation of A&M in our own little world, moved it up dramatically and rapidly.

03:42.831 --> 03:52.826
And did you have, in terms of salaries and other funding, did you have a budget that was comparable to other institutions of our sort?

03:53.186 --> 03:56.051
It was always reasonable.

03:56.852 --> 04:01.178
We were probably always in salaries in the median.

04:01.664 --> 04:07.875
But then we had the no state income tax, lower cost of living, you know, all those adjustments and that kind of thing.

04:08.396 --> 04:19.035
And then in more recent years, we got a career ladder agreed to by the president and we have become extremely competitive long term.

04:19.636 --> 04:23.082
We had a lot of hemorrhaging of, well,

04:23.753 --> 04:32.949
In this business, in counseling psychology, a lot of people start out in college counseling centers and then go to teaching or private practice or business consulting.

04:33.329 --> 04:36.174
So they use it as their first experiential base.

04:36.755 --> 04:40.241
And so you get a lot of people staying for two, three, four years, and then they're gone.

04:40.842 --> 04:46.892
With the career ladder, we have four gradations of psychologists with a 15% salary increase when they hit each grade.

04:47.463 --> 04:50.426
and now we have stopped the hemorrhaging.

04:50.486 --> 04:54.330
We have a number of long-term experienced staff.

04:57.133 --> 05:05.382
Describe your style, manner, as the chief of this tribe.

05:06.683 --> 05:08.385
How did you lead them?

05:08.485 --> 05:14.972
What were your guidelines, your plans?

05:15.509 --> 05:19.073
As you well know, PhDs are an interesting breed of cat.

05:20.095 --> 05:27.484
And in the area of psychology, especially when they're all licensed by the state, each one of them think that they are capable of running the world and the universe.

05:28.345 --> 05:36.555
And so I've always tried to be very professionally respectful of my colleagues.

05:37.008 --> 05:40.512
much as I think you do in an academic department.

05:40.532 --> 05:53.649
On the other hand, I have reminded them that we're really viewed as an administrative department, that I used to quote John Koldis who probably got it from someplace else, higher education is not a democracy.

05:53.669 --> 06:02.360
I used to remind people that if one of them screwed up, it was me that was on the carpet for it.

06:02.540 --> 06:06.525
I am responsible for you, you know, whether you agree with that or not, you know.

06:06.877 --> 06:14.626
But I always started with a base of a collegial kind of way and also trying to get buy-in to what we were doing.

06:15.567 --> 06:23.976
Now, I've been given feedback that I'm pretty good, though, at getting people, when they're not so crazy about doing something, to do it anyway.

06:24.597 --> 06:31.284
But I probably am like Lyndon Johnson, come let us reason together, although I'm sure I don't have the hammer he had.

06:31.344 --> 06:36.630
But I tend to use my power and my position as a last resort.

06:37.302 --> 06:39.993
I will not invoke that unless I absolutely have to.

06:40.013 --> 06:43.347
How often did you collect the whole team together to meet with them?

06:43.968 --> 06:46.271
Oh, we have a staff meeting once a week.

06:46.291 --> 06:48.073
Every week, yeah, once a week.

06:48.093 --> 06:53.401
And if you were giving them a set of guidelines, what were the important do's and don'ts?

06:54.722 --> 06:55.924
What was the professional staff?

06:55.944 --> 06:59.529
Oh, number one is students are number one.

06:59.869 --> 07:02.132
That's a constant reminder.

07:02.853 --> 07:13.367
In fact, not only did I take our psychology interns to those student service finance committee meetings where they, because 86% of the budget and informally 90% of our budget comes from student fees.

07:13.904 --> 07:24.660
And I really like that system because it made me every year go before 10 to 20 students and justify why we existed and what we were doing.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.743
And I thought that was proper because they're paying the bills.

07:27.525 --> 07:30.589
I'm sort of a consumer advocate kind of person of higher education.

07:31.270 --> 07:39.743
And then I would also take older staff members who've been with me 8, 10 years who might begin to forget where the money is that's paying their salary and that.

07:40.499 --> 07:44.824
It's important that they understand it's the kids and their families and loans.

07:45.805 --> 07:47.046
And this is who you're working for.

07:48.248 --> 07:50.510
So to me, students have always been number one.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.493
Another thing is, honestly, frugality.

07:53.714 --> 07:59.540
I mean, I wear a mantle of sometimes being somewhat cheap around here and frugal.

08:00.361 --> 08:08.650
But I'm not really, because when I'm given a portion of budget, a merit salary pot, I use the last dollar.

08:09.355 --> 08:10.897
and that kind of thing.

08:10.937 --> 08:19.405
But we had a staff member here who runs our helpline, which is a great, it's a group of 40 or 50 students who come in here at 4 p.m.

08:20.046 --> 08:21.107
They come in in pairs.

08:21.147 --> 08:23.770
They're put through 50 hours of training to man telephone lines.

08:24.251 --> 08:29.196
They come in 4 to 8, another two come in 8 to midnight, another two midnight to 4 a.m., another two 4 a.m.

08:29.216 --> 08:29.656
to 8 a.m.

08:29.696 --> 08:31.518
when we all come back.

08:31.678 --> 08:36.223
And I remember getting a bill like 18 bucks worth of postage, and I said,

08:36.203 --> 08:37.746
I said, Susan, what is this for?

08:37.766 --> 08:40.411
And she said, well, I forgot to tell them about our dinner.

08:40.452 --> 08:41.514
See, we pay them a dollar a month.

08:42.295 --> 08:45.722
And I forgot to tell them about our dinner, so I just sent out all these notices.

08:45.782 --> 08:51.273
And she said, but you know, she said, when you have a budget of over two million, you know, what's 18 or 20 bucks?

08:51.293 --> 08:54.660
And I said to her, Susan, you just said the wrong thing to the wrong guy.

08:54.961 --> 08:56.203
You know, because I know...

08:56.673 --> 09:03.925
three months down the road, they're going to, you know, we didn't budget for something and you need it and all those little bits of amount, you know, people come to you, they want money.

09:04.506 --> 09:08.292
So frugality and of course I'm a product of depression parents.

09:09.053 --> 09:16.145
So you use it, you use it again, you make it do as best you can, you know, and I mean obviously we always spent money.

09:16.165 --> 09:16.926
Howard Perry,

09:17.429 --> 09:26.141
I don't know if you know Howard, but Howard set up my budget the first year, and I ran in the red around April or May, because he had set it up.

09:26.201 --> 09:29.865
Howard was not exactly a spendthrift, bless his heart.

09:29.885 --> 09:32.289
And that's the only year I have ever run in the red.

09:32.589 --> 09:34.151
I have never gone back to the trough.

09:35.112 --> 09:42.162
And even Malin Sutherland has said to me in budget meetings, sometimes I don't totally understand what you're doing, but I trust you.

09:42.642 --> 09:44.685
And to me, that's the best compliment.

09:46.201 --> 09:53.655
All right, with new staff, were there any things that you told them, no, no, no?

09:54.777 --> 10:01.931
In the early years, especially, I said, you need to be aware we're in a conservative environment.

10:02.713 --> 10:05.458
I used to say it euphemistically, I think.

10:05.894 --> 10:14.728
I used to say, you know, I really have no right to know what you're doing in your personal life or to comment or anything like that.

10:14.908 --> 10:26.305
I said, but if you have a sexual preference for ducks, chickens, and pigs, I think you need to keep it off the campus, way off the campus, because that's going to create a problem.

10:26.866 --> 10:30.371
And what you're ultimately going to do is endanger a good service for kids.

10:30.392 --> 10:32.695
You're going to give us a black mark when we don't deserve it.

10:33.113 --> 10:42.967
And so I just said, you know, if there are any personal inclinations you have that are private and are not my business, just don't get them enmeshed in this environment because that's going to harm us.

10:43.448 --> 10:43.909
Don't do it.

10:44.329 --> 11:00.673
In fact, we had an intern right here from A&M who wound up having a relationship with a woman in marriage student housing whose husband was also a client of ours and was...

11:00.974 --> 11:06.700
and was telling another one of our staff that he had a weapon and was aware some guy was fooling around with his wife.

11:07.281 --> 11:08.242
And we knew he had a gun.

11:08.863 --> 11:14.308
And I didn't get involved in people's work, but I called that intern in and I said, hey, I got information.

11:14.389 --> 11:16.631
I said, he's marking your tires.

11:16.731 --> 11:18.113
He's checking your license plate out.

11:18.973 --> 11:20.495
You better cease and desist.

11:20.515 --> 11:22.617
You better cut this out right now.

11:22.697 --> 11:23.598
And that was rare for me.

11:23.618 --> 11:29.665
I remember once the fiscal affairs office called me, somebody from there about a,

11:29.780 --> 11:37.207
I hired the very first African-American staff member in the Division of Student Affairs in 1978 from University of Wisconsin.

11:37.427 --> 11:46.835
And I got a call and apparently a veterinarian in town complained to somebody who they knew in business affairs that she had not paid her veterinary bill.

11:48.056 --> 11:51.899
And the message to me was to put the screws on her.

11:52.800 --> 11:58.285
And I didn't know, I thought I was going against the A&M way in those days,

11:58.602 --> 12:11.738
I explained to the person that that person was coming to work on time, they were doing their professional work properly, and that I didn't feel it was my purview to interact with them on that level and refused to do that.

12:11.758 --> 12:21.150
And I don't know that that got me many points because apparently that system had worked previously on other people, but I felt very strongly that it was not my business.

12:21.215 --> 12:29.849
Could a young professional in the counseling service go on Saturday night and stand out on the street and drink at Northgate?

12:32.273 --> 12:34.436
Could they date an undergraduate student?

12:34.456 --> 12:39.224
Oh, well, undergraduate student client?

12:39.244 --> 12:40.045
That too?

12:40.226 --> 12:41.508
Oh, absolutely.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.893
Oh boy, psychology has come down on that like a hammer.

12:45.481 --> 12:56.696
Even my colleague Dave Drum, who's Director of Counseling and Assistant Vice President, he's told his staff, if you ever have any kind of intimate relationships with a client, I will destroy your career.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.861
Yeah, psychology has been too fraught with that kind of thing.

13:01.662 --> 13:09.733
And boy, on the state level and the national level, oh boy, that's a big no-no and they're taking action big time.

13:10.439 --> 13:13.222
The other thing, because I know faculty, it's like that with dating.

13:13.242 --> 13:29.837
I don't know that I would, unless it became something that was brought to my attention and was casting some kind of a negative aspersion on this counseling center, I don't know.

13:29.857 --> 13:33.561
I probably would talk to the person who was brought to my attention.

13:33.601 --> 13:37.324
I probably would bring them in this office and talk with them very privately about

13:37.793 --> 13:43.669
I've heard this and this is the impact it can have on you and on our service and on our mission.

13:44.324 --> 13:51.353
And I don't know that I'd come out with a direct hammer in the beginning, but I'm sure I would have a conversation if I got it from somebody else.

13:52.054 --> 13:56.500
All right, and let's see, still on guidelines for the staff.

13:57.121 --> 14:01.107
Normally a shirt and tie for the men.

14:01.347 --> 14:03.330
No, normally for the male staff.

14:03.430 --> 14:04.010
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

14:04.030 --> 14:07.655
Yeah, it's just slacks and a nice polo shirt, much probably like I'm dressed today.

14:08.697 --> 14:11.901
The administrative staff I had asked to be in coat and tie because...

14:12.235 --> 14:15.319
We tend to bump into parents more and external individuals.

14:15.339 --> 14:17.081
What about women dress?

14:17.101 --> 14:18.082
Oh, boy.

14:18.223 --> 14:19.664
Oh, my God.

14:19.785 --> 14:21.487
My secretary goes round and round with me.

14:22.108 --> 14:31.219
Sometimes we have dress down in the summer, and I started issuing this very benign thing of just some general limits, and then she started getting me about, well, what about culottes?

14:31.299 --> 14:34.123
And I didn't know a culotte from a whatever.

14:34.804 --> 14:35.745
Oh, my God.

14:36.012 --> 14:46.971
The women, I tend not to deal with them unless there's a dress that's obviously utterly too short or cleavage is going on.

14:48.394 --> 14:56.468
The other thing staff hates about me is I will not, even in the summer, abide by blue jeans.

14:57.089 --> 15:02.304
And in Malan's office and vice president's office, some of the secretarial staff will occasionally wear blue jeans, and that's fine with them.

15:02.845 --> 15:05.111
Yeah, the vice president's office is more liberal than I am.

15:05.272 --> 15:12.111
And I just continue to tell people, while I agree in the dress down thing, nice business casual, quote unquote,

15:12.412 --> 15:16.583
Blue jean is not what reflects a professional service.

15:16.784 --> 15:19.771
People are coming to us for a professional service, and I don't think that looks good.

15:19.872 --> 15:21.937
What about beards, mustaches, and hair length?

15:22.218 --> 15:26.008
I don't worry much about that.

15:26.910 --> 15:27.552
Really don't.

15:28.342 --> 15:33.051
The reason I don't is it's like our staff.

15:33.372 --> 15:38.322
I have probably half of our staff are Republicans and half of them are Democrats.

15:39.544 --> 15:42.891
We have Jewish, Catholic, Protestant.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.721
I have a blind counselor.

15:44.841 --> 15:46.967
I have an African-American, Hispanic.

15:48.009 --> 15:50.356
I have a woman from a PhD from Taiwan.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.627
You know, we got to have a lot of different people here because we've got a lot of different kids now.

15:54.647 --> 15:58.838
And so that's why I don't get caught up in, because you got to have somebody to relate to somebody.

15:59.695 --> 16:12.875
Now, do the students of Asian background, do they seek advice and counseling in about the same per capita percentage as other students?

16:15.399 --> 16:18.063
Let me answer it this way.

16:18.523 --> 16:23.070
We get a good representation of international students

16:23.320 --> 16:28.645
because of the staff member that we have here, Dr. Gisela Lin.

16:28.945 --> 16:31.487
She's from Taiwan, got her PhD at University of Massachusetts.

16:32.909 --> 16:42.798
She runs two different kinds of groups for international students, and she works hand-in-hand with the International Student Services Office, so she gets a lot of referrals.

16:42.818 --> 16:49.544
But interestingly, those groups for Asian students tend to be what we would call more psychoeducational discussion groups.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.606
They're not really deep therapy groups.

16:51.786 --> 16:53.007
They're not for that.

16:52.987 --> 16:59.915
I used to co-lead that group, one of the groups, and we thought we were trying to help the first semester international student here.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.838
They don't come because they're so worried about making the grades.

17:03.278 --> 17:06.462
If you get them after they become more comfortable academically, then they'll come.

17:07.082 --> 17:15.872
But then they want to discuss things like, well, we bring in the Yale leaders here to introduce them to Aggie traditions.

17:15.852 --> 17:40.813
we talk about you know American slang all of those things but it's not it's not like a psychotherapeutic group that's that's not what they're interested in except when she gets them and others of us who relate well to internationals except when you get them on one-on-one then they'll begin to talk about marital discord or something like that yeah and I'm assuming that

17:41.924 --> 17:50.577
faculty and professional staff individuals never came over to get personal counseling themselves.

17:50.958 --> 18:03.657
Well, that was interesting because Clint Phillips, years ago, and I really like Clint, Clint offered me a proposal at one time that if he would buy us a counselor, would we provide counseling services for the faculty?

18:04.197 --> 18:09.265
At that time, I think the faculty numbered 2,500 or something, I don't know, and then

18:09.245 --> 18:30.848
you know, being around for a little while I realized that probably a lot of faculty problems also were family problems and so I multiplied that by a husband and the stereotypical two children and I saw a catchment group of about 10,000 and I said, Clint, I don't, if this really took off, I think we'd get inundated, you know, and

18:31.165 --> 18:43.870
And so that really led to what I thought was much more appropriate was Human Resources Department setting up the EAP, Employee Assistance Program, where they now have one of our former interns, Dr. Anna Satterfield, there.

18:44.330 --> 18:47.036
And she has a staff of people to work with faculty and staff.

18:47.056 --> 18:51.925
That's why we purposely named this place the Student Counseling Service, to make it very clear.

18:52.563 --> 18:57.810
In the early, very early years, we did see a few faculty and staff on a time available basis.

18:58.831 --> 19:02.015
But then we began getting inundated with students.

19:02.035 --> 19:04.458
And then after a while you moved out of the apartment.

19:06.701 --> 19:07.702
Oh, you mean my personal life?

19:08.063 --> 19:08.163
Yeah.

19:08.183 --> 19:12.208
Oh yeah, I married a woman who was an Indiana University graduate.

19:12.762 --> 19:17.411
I met her at an IU picnic in Houston.

19:17.692 --> 19:25.948
And so we dated for over a year and then we got married in the chapel up at Indiana University since that was the common thread we had.

19:26.048 --> 19:30.737
She teaches English to international students in the English Language Institute.

19:31.325 --> 19:38.213
And what did you, and then the two of you, what did y'all do for relaxation?

19:38.293 --> 19:46.543
What did hobbies or avocations or... Fortunately, she loved to play golf, and she really got me re-interested in golf.

19:47.744 --> 19:53.050
So I often kid her that golf is the linchpin of the marriage, you know, and that kind of thing.

19:53.471 --> 19:59.037
In the early years, too, we were involved with a group in the community that gave monthly dinners for international students.

19:59.017 --> 20:02.822
My wife has a fantastic language facility.

20:02.862 --> 20:16.360
She speaks Spanish and French at the drop of a hat and has had good exposure to German, Italian, Portuguese, studied Russian up at Indiana University for two and a half months and then taught for A&M over at Kuriyama and picked up conversational Japanese.

20:16.741 --> 20:17.282
She's a marvel.

20:17.342 --> 20:21.367
She's terrible in history and psychology but wonderful languages.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.191
So those early years, they were really gratifying.

20:24.211 --> 20:25.733
A number of the faculty and

20:25.713 --> 20:29.320
and us got together and gave these dinners for these new international students.

20:29.340 --> 20:31.063
That was very important.

20:31.384 --> 20:43.587
She's always been very involved with professional groups of women in the community and also a major amount of her commitment, she's in a sorority Kappa Alpha Theta,

20:43.567 --> 20:47.052
So she's been on their advisory board and has been the advisor to the treasurer.

20:47.372 --> 20:51.137
And at the same time, I was a chapter advisor to Pi Kappa Phi here for 15 years.

20:51.658 --> 20:55.343
So we had sort of a Greek connection and the Gulf.

20:55.683 --> 20:58.888
And we both enjoy traveling.

21:01.331 --> 21:04.495
So, yeah, those are the main things.

21:04.913 --> 21:20.649
The coming of fraternities and sororities in large numbers, and in fact I'll ask you this trivia question, are you aware that we have a higher percentage per capita of fraternity and sorority members than does UT Austin?

21:20.670 --> 21:21.991
No, I didn't know that.

21:22.211 --> 21:26.436
Theirs are 5% of all undergraduate males and 6% females.

21:27.096 --> 21:28.778
Ours are 6 and 14.

21:29.028 --> 21:29.989
I'll be darned.

21:30.270 --> 21:33.855
We have more fraternity and sorority members than we have core members.

21:33.935 --> 21:35.176
Yeah, that I knew, yeah.

21:35.857 --> 21:46.272
Did the coming of fraternity and sororities in fairly large numbers here have any effect on counseling center's services, more or less?

21:46.812 --> 21:58.208
Oh, you'd get... We'd have those isolated specific incidences where hazing or some kind of abuse or something had happened within the fraternity house or the fraternity...

21:58.998 --> 22:00.083
excuse me, experience.

22:00.745 --> 22:07.675
It was just sort of, but then, you know, gosh, we've had abuse in the English club, you know.

22:08.127 --> 22:12.513
But you get more of it with the Greek groups, and I know them very well from my 15 years.

22:12.933 --> 22:20.443
So it added sort of another dimension, but I wouldn't say some astounding dimension that just totally changed us or anything like that.

22:20.623 --> 22:22.105
It was just the context was different.

22:22.125 --> 22:28.894
Because we get, we hear all the stuff that goes on in the cadet corps too, we get all of that stuff, you know, so it was just a different context.

22:29.615 --> 22:36.244
Right, how has the student, now look at the whole almost 30 years, how has the student body changed?

22:37.085 --> 22:49.356
Well, obviously, the advent of women, which I'll be honest with you, Haskell, I know I have my biases like everybody does, but I don't know that I would have come here if this was all male.

22:50.117 --> 22:52.379
Honestly, I think women add a wonderful dimension.

22:52.419 --> 23:00.367
And the thing that I think is so great is, at this school, is you can walk up to a female student and say, what's your major?

23:00.427 --> 23:03.970
Instead of getting the stereotypical elementary education or sociology,

23:03.950 --> 23:06.873
You get nuclear engineering, you know, and that kind of.

23:06.893 --> 23:11.238
So for a conservative campus, we have women in a lot of non-traditional curricula.

23:11.398 --> 23:13.700
And it's really, really impressive.

23:14.541 --> 23:18.506
Yeah, I think the advent of women has just been one of the great, great things.

23:19.847 --> 23:30.058
The watching the adjustment to the whole Greek thing that you brought in, because I've seen many times the shirts, no frats, you know, and that kind of thing.

23:30.494 --> 23:36.341
That has been an interesting phenomenon, because I know when I was first contacted my fraternity, I really did my best to discourage them.

23:36.822 --> 23:52.722
And I think part of it was not only that I didn't think the conditions were right, but also I think I was sort of respectful and understanding of the cadet corps tradition, and that maybe there should be campuses that are different from other campuses, that that was OK and that was good in a lot of instances.

23:53.242 --> 23:55.485
So the Greek thing has been interesting.

23:56.506 --> 24:01.572
The students coming from more of an urban background, a more sophisticated background over the years has been a change.

24:01.592 --> 24:07.438
Because I did get more of a feel in the early years, for me, 74, you know, the mid-70s.

24:08.019 --> 24:12.664
I saw more cowboy boots and more cowboy hats and more kids, yes sir and no sir and that.

24:12.865 --> 24:17.110
And now they're much more sophisticated people from urban areas.

24:18.431 --> 24:20.093
That's been a change.

24:21.878 --> 24:29.852
Again, I know this is a repeat, but I still, no matter what the former students say, I still think this campus is extraordinarily friendly.

24:30.574 --> 24:31.836
I don't think that's changed.

24:33.699 --> 24:36.985
I think it's astoundingly great.

24:37.673 --> 24:40.016
What about the problems these students are having?

24:40.056 --> 24:41.197
How have those changed?

24:41.217 --> 24:42.259
Yeah.

24:42.559 --> 24:43.300
You know, it's interesting.

24:43.320 --> 24:46.884
You get some universal things that just go on.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.166
They seem to go on forever.

24:49.748 --> 24:52.531
Conflicts with mom and dad, I mentioned before, with roommates.

24:53.152 --> 24:54.554
Great preparation for marriage, by the way.

24:55.915 --> 24:58.598
Boyfriend, girlfriend, or whatever the partner relationship is.

24:59.199 --> 25:00.961
Feeling they're mistreated by a faculty member.

25:01.302 --> 25:03.985
Those anxiety, depression,

25:03.965 --> 25:09.398
suicidal ideation, those things seem to endure, although they've become more intensified.

25:09.899 --> 25:17.177
And then you'll get these little ripples of unique problems, like more recently it's been this whole internet addiction.

25:17.197 --> 25:19.763
We get people who, students who are not

25:19.743 --> 25:31.705
who don't have very good social skills, and just working on the computer and talking with a person without a personal flesh-to-flesh relationship makes them feel very comfortable, and then they get involved in some of these crazy relationships.

25:32.607 --> 25:35.372
Plus, they're not developing their social skills that they ought to.

25:35.352 --> 25:38.460
So you get these blips of things.

25:38.721 --> 25:48.687
I know 10 or 12 years ago we were running for especially women a lot of assertiveness training groups for women to speak up and make their needs known.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.492
And the whole premise of that was

25:50.472 --> 25:56.107
You may not get what you want, but at least you'll feel better about yourself for having asked for it.

25:56.127 --> 26:00.137
And we didn't want to turn out a bunch of hostile people, but we wanted them to assert.

26:00.338 --> 26:06.895
So you get these blips in fads and services, you know, the assertiveness training, and then also you get the internet addiction problem.

26:06.875 --> 26:16.668
But underneath that, you get the same stream of students trying to resolve the parent-child relationship, you know, going from a superior to support relationship to a co-equal adult relationship.

26:17.129 --> 26:20.213
The choice of a life's work always stays universal.

26:21.274 --> 26:23.337
What does it mean to be truly humanly intimate?

26:23.798 --> 26:31.808
And that's where a lot of men and women get, sexuality gets screwed up with human intimacy and there's a difference and they can co-mingle, yes, but there's a difference.

26:31.868 --> 26:35.413
And there's so many things that just seem to stay.

26:35.900 --> 26:37.283
What about drugs and alcohol?

26:37.343 --> 26:38.606
What changes there?

26:38.626 --> 26:52.997
Yeah, definitely much more incidents, greater variety of things to tap into in terms of illicit drugs typically, or even the alcohol and that kind of thing.

26:54.040 --> 27:03.620
And again, no question, every campus in this country that I know of is reporting more serious psychological problems.

27:04.282 --> 27:05.204
No question about it.

27:05.424 --> 27:09.192
Been going up and up and up at distressing levels.

27:09.813 --> 27:13.922
And I'm assuming that those are not necessarily correlated

27:14.037 --> 27:19.242
by grade levels that some of the high-capability students and some of the low?

27:19.723 --> 27:20.504
Oh, yeah, right.

27:21.104 --> 27:27.270
We get referrals, like from the Memorial Student Center, where you get a large core of student leader types.

27:27.451 --> 27:29.553
And we don't get that many referrals.

27:29.653 --> 27:40.564
But when we get them, the students are, it's tougher for them to deal with the problems because they have such heavy responsibility in their student leadership problem.

27:40.644 --> 27:43.707
It exacerbates the basic problem.

27:43.771 --> 27:44.833
that they're having.

27:45.514 --> 27:54.047
You get the average Joe Doe student here who doesn't have that leadership responsibility and it's less stressful, less difficult.

27:54.568 --> 28:04.564
But yeah, I'm not sure that anyone's academic proficiency or socioeconomic status is really an inoculation against

28:05.506 --> 28:07.488
You know, kind of a lot of the mom and apple pie problems.

28:07.508 --> 28:15.378
I mean, to me, conflicts with mom and dad, fights with boyfriend, girlfriend, roommates, to me, that's just life.

28:15.398 --> 28:17.381
That's normal apple pie stuff.

28:17.401 --> 28:23.148
Now, we get some of these marital sleeping around where it's a whole, you know, six couples that you have to ferret it out.

28:23.929 --> 28:30.737
You know, I had a young man in about three months ago who's 6,000 bucks in debt to a bookie.

28:30.717 --> 28:34.542
picked up a former professional athlete with some money who funded him.

28:34.582 --> 28:35.624
And he thought he was good betting.

28:36.385 --> 28:37.967
And he didn't make some good selections.

28:38.027 --> 28:38.668
And he's in debt.

28:38.688 --> 28:42.253
And the bookie is kind of, I don't know if they're going to start with the fingers and toes.

28:42.313 --> 28:47.360
But it's amazing what the students get into.

28:47.760 --> 28:54.029
But the blessing is college students, unquestionably to me, and I'm biased, are the best population to work with.

28:54.389 --> 28:58.615
Because they're bright, they're young, which means they're usually a little more flexible.

28:58.595 --> 29:03.462
and they can get into holes, but they can also dig themselves out very proficiently.

29:03.783 --> 29:08.470
It's a great, I mean, it beats a 60-year-old schizophrenic like I might be over in Austin State Hospital.

29:08.890 --> 29:10.853
You can work with them for years and get nowhere.

29:11.855 --> 29:12.435
Students are great.

29:12.796 --> 29:17.242
Can you share any examples of tragedies where advice didn't work?

29:18.925 --> 29:24.573
I wasn't personally involved in this, but it is virtually, it's almost foolproof.

29:24.593 --> 29:27.117
It's 99% sure that if we get a student

29:27.704 --> 29:35.605
who is talking about suicide or has even made one attempt, it's 99% sure after we get a hold of them they will not try it again.

29:36.607 --> 29:39.655
And in one case, we did have a student who did kill himself.

29:40.310 --> 29:41.952
And I was not the counselor.

29:42.312 --> 29:43.474
It was another staff member.

29:43.714 --> 29:49.060
And that was, frankly, a shock to this whole staff because we just don't lose people once we get them.

29:49.120 --> 29:56.108
And you say that that's one of the places where A&M is, thank goodness, we don't fit the national norm.

29:56.288 --> 29:56.709
Correct.

29:57.449 --> 29:58.771
Yeah.

29:58.951 --> 30:05.018
There are a number of years over my 27 years where we have gotten away with no fatalities, no suicides.

30:05.268 --> 30:09.976
The average is probably one to two, and it's almost always off campus.

30:10.417 --> 30:13.503
They'll be back at home in Houston or Dallas or something like that.

30:14.064 --> 30:21.437
But I know like Farnsworth years ago did a major study of college student suicide, and I don't know if the data still holds true, but

30:21.417 --> 30:26.143
But it was like for every 10,000 students you had, you could expect one to three suicides.

30:26.843 --> 30:32.250
Well, if you extrapolate that to 40,000, we ought to be having 12 to 15 suicides a year.

30:32.330 --> 30:36.695
So A&M has had a wonderfully, of course, one is too many.

30:37.255 --> 30:38.177
One is always too many.

30:38.757 --> 30:45.345
But if you look at it purely statistically, yeah, this campus is, and again, I give a lot of credit just to the environment.

30:46.686 --> 30:50.631
I mean, I think we help, but I think the environment is so important.

30:50.729 --> 30:57.816
What are the events, the rituals, the traditionals, the attitudes here that contribute to that positive?

30:58.036 --> 30:58.737
Yeah.

30:58.757 --> 31:02.821
Well, I think, you know, the phrase from the song, you know, the Aggies are we.

31:03.501 --> 31:16.033
I think just that notion and that bonding from Fish Camp and just the way I think students here and people tend to make people feel included.

31:16.794 --> 31:17.715
Right.

31:19.332 --> 31:21.999
Yale practice, football games, muster.

31:22.019 --> 31:22.340
Oh, yeah.

31:22.360 --> 31:22.982
All add to that.

31:23.262 --> 31:24.325
Yeah, all add to that.

31:25.007 --> 31:28.937
And we know that even in terms of alumni giving,
