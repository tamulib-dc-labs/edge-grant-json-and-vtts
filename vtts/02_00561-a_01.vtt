WEBVTT

00:25.681 --> 00:26.582
Hello? Hello, Mr. Green? Yes. It's Michelle. Hi. 
How are you, Michelle? I'm fine. How are you?

00:40.474 --> 00:41.095
I'm sorry. Is she there? Is she there?

00:47.760 --> 00:55.367
Are

00:47.760 --> 00:55.367
you ready? Okay. Okay, I'll tell you what's going 
to go on. The tapes I'm using, they last 30 minutes,

01:02.332 --> 01:08.181
and then there'll be a beep, and I'm going to have to 
get up and turn them over. And the machine's in

01:09.382 --> 01:16.833
another room, so when there's a beep, you'll 
understand what's going on. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:20.356 --> 01:25.504
Okay.

01:25.884 --> 01:28.448
Well, let me give you an overview sort of how I'm 
going to do this. I'm going to ask you about the

01:28.808 --> 01:44.632
Communist Party, what exactly it means, the 
American Communist Party, as far as does it align

01:28.808 --> 01:44.632
itself with Marxism, Leninism, Castroism, 
Chinese Communism, I don't know, Maoism. Then

01:45.553 --> 01:48.117
I'll ask you about your background, your 
childhood. Okay. your experiences that led you to

01:48.824 --> 01:51.527
join. Yeah. And then I'll ask you about

01:55.731 --> 02:02.819
the trial.

02:05.522 --> 02:06.803
Things happened to you during the trial. Then I'll 
ask you questions about your experience as a

02:07.144 --> 02:13.971
fugitive and about the FBI and their harassing 
your wife and your children and the techniques

02:15.031 --> 02:21.578
they used. And then I'll ask you about some of your 
experiences in Leavenworth. And then I'll ask you

02:26.563 --> 02:34.131
about, sort of ask you if you could do it over again, 
how would you do it? And then ask you about the talk

02:35.092 --> 02:43.080
you were going to give here.

02:43.972 --> 02:47.556
Quite a long subject. Uh-huh. Is that okay? Okay. 
Okay. Well, let's begin with the Communist Party.

02:54.764 --> 02:56.687
When you say communists, what exactly do you mean?

03:07.819 --> 03:10.182
What I mean by that is a movement designed in which 
the wealth and productive powers are inside our

03:07.819 --> 03:10.182
own common people.

03:15.325 --> 03:45.332
uh-huh

03:15.325 --> 03:45.332
uh-huh Yes.

04:13.096 --> 04:13.176
Yes. Yeah.

04:38.895 --> 04:38.995
Yeah. Well, okay, so, well, do you align yourself 
with strict Marxist, pure Marxist theory, or do

04:41.000 --> 05:07.412
you, I mean, because there's been application of 
Marx by Lenin and Stalin, and there's... Well,

04:41.000 --> 05:07.412
we call ourselves Marxist-Leninists, really, 
because we believe in the fundamentals of Marxist

04:41.000 --> 05:07.412
analysis of Catholic society and the world 
itself. uh-huh

05:07.949 --> 05:37.821
uh-huh Yeah.

06:04.225 --> 06:04.365
Mm-hmm. He

06:04.632 --> 06:26.708
believed what happened was that the first country 
that takes the path of revolution will be that

06:04.632 --> 06:26.708
country, not that it necessarily goes developed 
economically, where the oppression is so great

06:04.632 --> 06:26.708
that people revolt. And the only answer to them is 
to break away from imperialist domination in

06:26.728 --> 06:28.611
another direction. That was a very fundamental 
addition to Marxism. So, in other words, it didn't

06:30.383 --> 06:32.765
have to be industrial?

06:36.128 --> 06:49.941
It doesn't have to be as firm as

06:36.128 --> 06:49.941
it is. But Lenin was proven right because old 
Russia was a very backward country. Yeah. And then

06:51.943 --> 06:52.704
the revolution switched that. Take in terms of the 
other countries in which it occurred, China,

06:52.724 --> 06:56.087
Cuba, and so forth, zero, so underdeveloped 
countries. While they were the most developed

06:56.107 --> 06:57.488
industrial countries in the world, Yeah.

07:04.055 --> 07:07.821
Well, at one point in your book, you talk about 
visiting the Soviet Union. And you say that you had

07:09.623 --> 07:15.593
seen that they had advanced considerably. They 
had made, I'm not sure what the term is, but you were

07:15.633 --> 07:25.028
impressed with the progress they had made since 
the revolution? Well, I was there when I referred

07:25.227 --> 07:40.087
my book to the

07:25.227 --> 07:40.087
period I was there. In the 30s? Which was not too 
long after the revolution. Yeah. In 1934, 1932,

07:45.795 --> 07:46.276
isn't it? Yes. And I described how terrible 
conditions were. Yeah. But at the same time, I was

07:49.140 --> 07:50.762
inspired by the kind of a people's movement there 
was Do

07:51.316 --> 08:02.388
you still hold that? Well,

08:03.149 --> 08:15.442
let's look at it this way. It was very likely the 
most underdeveloped country in Europe at the

08:15.463 --> 08:16.924
time. Today, the Soviet Union is the second... the

08:19.548 --> 08:41.289
most important state in the world. And certainly, 
it has developed tremendously. It could not have

08:42.230 --> 08:43.231
happened without one, of course. Furthermore, 
with all of the backwardness that they still have,

08:43.251 --> 08:46.574
lack of things, there are some things that they 
have that we in the West do not appreciate at all.

08:47.755 --> 08:48.997
For example, there is no illiteracy in the Soviet 
Union. That's the way it is. free

08:50.007 --> 09:11.600
education for all, from kindergarten all the

08:50.007 --> 09:11.600
way through university, including stipends for 
those who go to college or university and need

08:50.007 --> 09:11.600
public help. There's also free health care for the 
very most part, hospital care, which we have a long

09:11.620 --> 09:15.286
way from having. In fact, we're going backwards, 
cutting, spending on Medicare and other things

09:15.306 --> 09:17.770
like that. We

09:18.037 --> 09:38.058
don't have any unemployment in this country. 
Also, they have no unemployment. They have a

09:38.739 --> 09:39.980
society based on the principle of full 
employment. The last time they had unemployment

09:40.000 --> 09:41.081
was in 1930 or 31. Since then, they've had full 
employment. Now, all those things are

09:41.922 --> 09:42.903
tremendously important. Also, take red. There's 
no... A

09:43.838 --> 10:05.943
family

09:43.838 --> 10:05.943
has to pay more

09:43.838 --> 10:05.943
than

09:43.838 --> 10:05.943
10% of its earnings on rent. The average is really 
about 5%, 6%. And that is all established by law

10:06.684 --> 10:10.068
that prohibits people being taken advantage of or 
creating conditions in which people have no means

10:06.684 --> 10:10.068
of living and have to be homeless. There are no 
homeless in the Soviet Union, as against this very

10:10.088 --> 10:11.770
restriction of ours, Yeah.

10:15.887 --> 10:34.044
But despite the lack of hunger and that everyone 
does have shelter, don't the Politburo and those

10:15.887 --> 10:34.044
up in the social structure, don't they have a lot 
more than the rest of the people? I mean, I don't

10:34.064 --> 10:36.787
think it's that equal. Well, I don't know. First of 
all,

10:40.015 --> 11:01.704
Karl Marx himself put forth the rules for 
different stages of development. He said the

11:01.724 --> 11:05.089
first stage would be socialism, in which the 
productive forces of society have not yet reached

11:01.724 --> 11:05.089
the point where everybody can have everything on 
equal basis. He said the rules for the first period

11:05.109 --> 11:07.272
would be following the motto, from each, 
according to his ability, to

11:07.471 --> 11:25.834
each according to his contribution, meaning that 
those who produce more, who all give more to

11:07.471 --> 11:25.834
society, have a right to have more in order to 
encourage further activity and giving them

11:07.471 --> 11:25.834
incentive for producing and doing more. He

11:25.814 --> 11:42.963
says

11:25.814 --> 11:42.963
in the second stage, which he called the communist 
period, then he says the productive force of

11:25.814 --> 11:42.963
society would reach the point where it would be 
possible to operate on a different model. The

11:42.983 --> 11:45.527
model, he says, from each according to his 
ability, to each according to his needs. Because

11:45.547 --> 11:46.168
in that second stage... So

11:46.604 --> 11:59.217
we're still caught, or they're still caught in the 
first stage? I see. And when will the second...

12:04.583 --> 12:06.645
When do you predict the second stage coming about?

12:16.275 --> 12:16.375
Yeah. Because

12:17.215 --> 12:40.228
as it is, they have not yet developed an infinity 
vast size of 30 million. And this population, they

12:40.248 --> 12:42.731
have not developed, come even closest yet to the 
per capita industrial production in this

12:40.248 --> 12:42.731
country. So they have to catch up with the 
capitalist West and productivity and things like

12:42.751 --> 12:44.514
that. So certainly they're not going to have the 
same... Don't you think that's an unrealistic

12:45.903 --> 12:54.336
goal to catch up with?

12:56.519 --> 12:57.902
No, no, no. Let me ask you this question, though, to 
make this point. We are now going through a very

13:05.794 --> 13:09.680
complex revolution in science and technology. In 
fact, we are having more and more robots replacing

13:09.700 --> 13:11.202
robots.

13:17.577 --> 13:39.769
like

13:17.577 --> 13:39.769
4 million robots engaged in the American 
industry. By 1990, and that's only four years from

13:39.790 --> 13:42.073
now, they expect there will be from 50 to 100,000 
robots in the industry. And the process will

13:42.093 --> 13:43.134
continue in an accelerated way. Today, we are 
there on the top of an economic cycle. We're not

13:44.296 --> 13:46.960
having a depression right now, but government 
figures admit that there are 7 to 10 million

13:44.296 --> 13:46.960
unemployed in the United States. Now,

13:48.053 --> 14:08.515
what will happen tomorrow

13:48.053 --> 14:08.515
as these robots take over and if you enter a 
department, the number of unemployment is going

13:48.053 --> 14:08.515
to continue to grow all the time. Now, there's one 
thing. The day will very likely come when every

14:09.015 --> 14:13.380
automobile is built, will be built by robots doing 
all the manual labor. But the day will never come

14:13.400 --> 14:15.242
when a robot buys an automobile or even a 
McDonald's hamburger. In other

14:15.307 --> 14:41.402
words, what I'm saying is that the very progress 
that automation and scientific innovation is

14:15.307 --> 14:41.402
producing is going to create a situation in which 
the less and less workers will be employed,

14:15.307 --> 14:41.402
because so long as there's a profit motive in doing 
that, those who invest in these computers and

14:15.307 --> 14:41.402
robots are out to make more profit. They don't do 
the damn job when more workers are getting work.

14:42.728 --> 14:45.291
That's true, but... The change has got to come. Can 
I ask you, where do you get your percentages from?

14:50.417 --> 14:50.738
My what? The percentages you just gave, the 
statistics, the amount, the robots.

14:59.749 --> 15:01.631
Oh, I got that.

15:05.276 --> 15:05.436
Oh, yes. And I'll give you the source if you want. 
Yeah. There's a booklet put out by the American

15:06.417 --> 15:10.001
Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial 
Organizations, the ASLCI. Uh-huh. And it's

15:10.182 --> 15:10.542
called... The

15:13.087 --> 15:22.039
Future of Work. Yeah.

15:27.005 --> 15:28.527
And it was put out a year ago. It discusses 
precisely this topic. And it gives official and

15:29.308 --> 15:31.651
global statistics in regard to robotization and 
everything else. Okay. So that's the source of it.

15:33.854 --> 15:34.495
Well, so do you... Does the American Communist 
Party align itself with the Soviet Communist

15:35.937 --> 15:39.281
Party then? As far as... Well, do you share their 
ideologies more so than, say, with Castro or with

15:42.044 --> 15:51.817
Chinese?

15:51.837 --> 16:02.812
No, there's no matter of sharing

15:51.837 --> 16:02.812
with them more than with the Cubans or with people 
in Angola or anywhere. But because we all

16:02.832 --> 16:05.115
essentially have the same ideology, often 
there'll be differences, like in any science. All

16:05.585 --> 16:24.453
scientists

16:05.585 --> 16:24.453
may agree on certain principles as time goes on, 
but they differ in regard to different questions.

16:24.473 --> 16:28.299
And so are the same in regard to the world communist 
movement. They agree with one general ideology,

16:28.319 --> 16:33.887
but just as Lenin had to make changes, as Marx 
originally said, because the world had changed,

16:28.319 --> 16:33.887
so today we have changes that are taking place that 
have to change to come. A country

16:34.070 --> 16:51.296
that's

16:34.070 --> 16:51.296
underdeveloped has one set of problems than a 
country that's developed, so that you'll find the

16:34.070 --> 16:51.296
applications will differ. And also, sometimes 
there are sharp differences, like Chinese under

16:51.316 --> 16:55.302
Mao Zedong that developed its own ideology, which 
now they are . And Yugoslavs have differences. the

16:56.497 --> 17:14.115
Romanians have

16:56.497 --> 17:14.115
differences. In other words, those who say that 
the Soviet Union sort of dominates all that, they

17:14.135 --> 17:18.379
can see that that's not so because of the very 
differences that are there. I see. And sometimes

17:18.539 --> 17:20.161
so sharply that one socialist country will start 
attacking another. Yeah. An ideological

17:20.301 --> 17:20.841
question. Well, are there obvious differences 
between the United States and other... And

17:25.623 --> 17:28.026
between the U.S. party? Yeah. And the... And, say, 
other countries? Well... Say the Soviet Union or,

17:33.093 --> 17:36.617
say, Q... Try to

17:36.637 --> 17:46.830
apply the principles of Marxism-Leninism to the 
United States. Uh-huh. Well, yes, take in regard

17:47.010 --> 17:48.232
to a country like old Russia there. The revolution 
came by a violent open field. Okay. And in your

17:49.932 --> 17:54.078
book, you say that you don't advocate violence at 
all. Yes, that's

17:55.060 --> 18:07.699
right. At this point, we're so far off that we don't 
know under what conditions. But we believe that it

18:10.944 --> 18:15.290
is possible to bring about a very important change 
in our own violence, and that if violence comes,

18:10.944 --> 18:15.290
it's not going to come from the people or from the 
communists. The opposition, yeah. like

18:17.497 --> 18:39.404
in Chile or elsewhere, and they will, in the face of 
the demand of people for change, they're going to

18:17.497 --> 18:39.404
try, or they have up to now, most of the time, to try 
to crush it. And then the people have got to resist

18:39.424 --> 18:40.365
somehow. No. So that you put, or take in the 
different countries that have been oppressed so

18:40.465 --> 18:43.209
terribly in the third world, you have guerrilla 
fighting. Because There

18:43.585 --> 19:00.256
is no democracy under which to bring about change. 
And as John Kennedy said once, he said, if people

19:00.276 --> 19:03.222
are not permitted to make a revolution 
peacefully, they can make it violent. And that's

19:03.242 --> 19:03.923
what's happening there. But certainly, we would 
commend, or sharply, anyone who thought to change

19:03.943 --> 19:06.167
guerrilla warfare in this country. And

19:07.447 --> 19:32.138
during the

19:07.447 --> 19:32.138
1960s, when you had some of these young people who 
thought the revolution was around the corner and

19:07.447 --> 19:32.138
were trying to imitate what had happened in other 
countries, the guerrilla warfare, we put the

19:07.447 --> 19:32.138
shots down against them. In fact, I wrote a book 
called The New Left, Anarchist or Marxist, The New

19:32.158 --> 19:36.323
Radicalism, Anarchist or Marxist, which 
appeared and got considerable circulation in

19:32.158 --> 19:36.323
that period where I took issue with it. I

19:36.522 --> 19:48.834
see.

19:48.854 --> 19:48.974
Hmm. Okay, well, let me ask you questions about 
your background, then. So what were your parents?

19:58.142 --> 20:05.429
Were they... Did they... My parents were not born 
in this country. Yeah. Uh-huh. One was born in...

20:07.842 --> 20:24.606
Uh-huh.

20:37.405 --> 20:37.545
Uh-huh. We

20:38.673 --> 20:53.569
lived

20:38.673 --> 20:53.569
at

20:38.673 --> 20:53.569
that time on Jewish. We lived

20:53.589 --> 20:57.854
in what was known as the Jewish ghetto. Nowadays 
you don't hear Jewish ghettos. You get Puerto

20:59.696 --> 21:00.977
Rican ghettos, Mexican ghettos, things like 
that. Then black ghettos, not in their world.

21:20.253 --> 21:24.479
Were your parents politically involved? Were 
they a member of

21:24.499 --> 21:49.132
any...

21:24.499 --> 21:49.132
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. He died

21:49.531 --> 21:56.359
at 33 years of age. I was the

21:56.379 --> 22:01.505
oldest of three children. That's why you started 
to work so young. And then I had to help

22:02.346 --> 22:06.972
out in every way I could. To help my mother who 
worked. Your uncle Isidore, though, was a

22:08.434 --> 22:11.658
socialist. He was a socialist. By the way, during 
that period of time, I was younger. He was a

22:15.422 --> 22:16.163
socialist, but he was quiet.

22:21.273 --> 22:43.124
Although

22:21.273 --> 22:43.124
he is very well-known, he served, he was sentenced 
to a 10-year prison term and served a number of

22:21.273 --> 22:43.124
years in black, which was an opposition to the war. 
Yeah. And I remember that as a child, as I grew up, I

22:43.264 --> 22:45.407
couldn't understand why someone was forced to go 
to prison. Mm-hmm.

22:51.399 --> 23:14.245
But in

22:51.399 --> 23:14.245
my neighborhood, as

22:51.399 --> 23:14.245
I described in the book, there was a socialist 
center, and workers, sick and dead, benefit from

22:51.399 --> 23:14.245
their choral groups, other cultural groups, and 
also meetings with the Socialist Party and what

22:51.399 --> 23:14.245
their youth organization was, the Young People's 
Socialist Party. Yeah. So that... Yeah.

23:40.017 --> 23:41.520
Uh-huh.

23:43.182 --> 23:43.322
Uh-huh. Uh

23:44.129 --> 24:05.211
huh.

24:05.231 --> 24:05.952
Uh huh.

24:31.278 --> 24:40.010
Well, you went to one of their meetings, the 
young...

24:31.278 --> 24:40.010
Yeah.

24:43.414 --> 24:47.159
And they were very friendly to you and very 
inviting. They invited you to join.

24:53.387 --> 24:55.230
I see. What's his name, Mr. Harry Gaines? Gannis. 
Gannis, okay. And he said... At one point he says

25:01.332 --> 25:10.895
something about you don't have to worry your 
generation is lucky before you reach the age of 25

25:01.332 --> 25:10.895
who will have lived through an American socialist 
revolution. When I joined, I was asked whether I

25:10.975 --> 25:18.312
couldn't get

25:10.975 --> 25:18.312
a meeting with my friends at the locker.

25:40.837 --> 26:03.589
Backward

25:40.837 --> 26:03.589
Russia can't be very long before it comes through 
developed countries of the United States. My

26:03.609 --> 26:04.670
first question comes from one of the young people. 
I guess the question we're all very, very

26:04.691 --> 26:06.573
interested in hearing the answer. How long will it 
take before the revolution comes to the United

26:06.593 --> 26:08.015
States? And he said, well, he said... Marxism

26:09.203 --> 26:33.390
is

26:09.203 --> 26:33.390
a science,

26:09.203 --> 26:33.390
social science, not dependent on what happens, 
whether what the ruling class does, also to what

26:09.203 --> 26:33.390
extent the mass movement is created, what the 
character, the leadership of the movement, all

26:09.203 --> 26:33.390
that. But then if you looked at our crestfallen 
faces, you'd say, well, these kids are lucky. For

26:35.232 --> 26:36.654
anyone who leaves 25 years of age will live through 
the revolution. Uh-huh.

26:39.747 --> 27:03.149
Oh,

26:39.747 --> 27:03.149
use

26:39.747 --> 27:03.149
the term, it's a science. Use the term science, 
social science. Now, why do you use the term

27:09.937 --> 27:23.530
science?

27:32.639 --> 27:33.320
Why do I call it a social science? Yes. Well, 
because it's a science that's science. It

27:34.341 --> 27:37.864
analyzes the entire course of human society, 
ensuring that a man started, a woman started, a

27:34.341 --> 27:37.864
human being started, a woman started. There were 
no class divisions. People tended to share. We

27:39.417 --> 27:42.660
have to work in common in order to survive. Uh-huh.

28:10.854 --> 28:10.994
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Nowadays,

28:11.834 --> 28:27.033
it's confessed itself. So what finally happened,

28:27.053 --> 28:36.025
however, that was the first and the longest stage 
of human history, primitive communal society.

28:36.045 --> 28:40.390
Then what happened was, by the development of 
agriculture, and husbandry, it became, and we

28:36.045 --> 28:40.390
developed in a certain, first primitive tools, 
which enhanced productivity, and what happened

28:36.045 --> 28:40.390
was that a surplus was created.

28:43.677 --> 29:08.205
for

28:43.677 --> 29:08.205
a ruling class,

28:43.677 --> 29:08.205
a

28:43.677 --> 29:08.205
group,

28:43.677 --> 29:08.205
to separate themselves from the rest of society in 
terms of income and in terms of certain interests.

29:08.225 --> 29:10.848
So what happened then was that there was the first 
ruling group, class divisions of society. And

29:10.868 --> 29:12.250
because there were people who were lived

29:12.837 --> 29:31.081
in

29:12.837 --> 29:31.081
different areas and often would have 
overpopulation or would have natural disasters

29:12.837 --> 29:31.081
like fires or terrific storms or earthquakes and 
what have you. People tended to move elsewhere.

29:31.862 --> 29:32.963
Also it has consequences even in collision with 
others. In the early period when one tried

29:45.372 --> 30:03.397
Yeah.

30:14.833 --> 30:14.973
Uh-huh. Can you... Can you hold on? I'm sorry. It's 
just beeping and I need to turn it off. Hold on just

30:21.443 --> 30:22.872
one minute.
