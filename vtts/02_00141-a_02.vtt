WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:09.013
Down on the fourth floor, it had all kinds of trash 
and garbage and dirt mixed in with it. Then on the

00:09.033 --> 00:15.582
second floor, it was plenty of water that stayed 
with us, and we could sweep it down to the first

00:09.033 --> 00:15.582
floor, which of course caught it off. Were there 
ever any fireworks in the... I never heard any,

00:18.846 --> 00:20.508
don't recall any. Okay. Nothing electrical, 
nothing plugged into a socket. Not that I recall.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.380
I'll tell you how tight I was. I had a radio. I 
couldn't get it to play. They said you needed an

00:32.096 --> 00:35.921
aerial so I went over and I didn't know what aerial 
wire was. So I went over to the store at Northgate.

00:40.986 --> 00:45.712
They told me that the wire that I asked for, I said 
this is probably what I need. I didn't know

00:45.732 --> 00:48.555
anything. And it was a regular electrical wire and 
they said it was 10 cents a foot. Well I know the

00:52.500 --> 00:55.343
nearest tree must have been 50 feet away. They 
didn't have five dollars to spend on So I just told

00:58.520 --> 01:03.508
him I'd take three feet and walk out of there with 
three feet. Of course, it was absolutely no value.

01:05.632 --> 01:09.278
Later, I found out what aerial wire was and brought 
some. The radio never did work

01:09.298 --> 01:14.766
well. Once you became a sophomore, during the war 
years, was there very much difference in being a

01:18.955 --> 01:26.666
freshman, and were those class differences 
notable during the war, or were they obscured? No,

01:27.026 --> 01:28.108
no, they were notable. We knew who sophomores were 
and juniors and who the freshmen were. And let's

01:31.413 --> 01:47.275
see, as a freshman, I don't think we had any 
freshmen in our, I think we were really sophomore

01:31.413 --> 01:47.275
freshmen, because as I remember, the sophomore 
and the few juniors and seniors were there all in

01:31.413 --> 01:47.275
the same dorm, I don't think we had any freshmen in 
our dorm until our junior year. We had been there in

01:52.921 --> 01:55.884
our fifth semester. So you arrived in late May of 
43. Yes. And you're there for how long before you go

02:00.268 --> 02:02.570
away? I left at the end of May in 1945, and I went in 
active duty. Qualified, had six semesters, and

02:08.977 --> 02:15.243
had enough hours to be classified as a senior. OK. 
On the serious side. What did you and your

02:17.798 --> 02:24.125
contemporaries think about in your serious 
moments? What did you all think was just ahead of

02:24.706 --> 02:26.788
you? Well, y'all knew we were going into service, 
and that my roommate and I had hitchhiked to

02:28.070 --> 02:40.725
Houston and stayed with my folks and enlisted in 
the Air Force in November of 45, 44. We weren't

02:42.166 --> 02:47.232
called until we had the K-18 to be called up.

02:48.207 --> 02:50.110
I don't know that we thought anything serious. We 
paid attention to the war a little bit. I don't know

02:54.857 --> 02:56.239
that we thought much about it. I don't remember any 
serious discussions. Well, did you all think this

03:00.745 --> 03:05.012
was like a court trip or that it was a lot more 
serious than that? Well, we had fun. I don't know. I

03:06.774 --> 03:10.840
guess it was fun we had while we were there. Looking 
back, I know I enjoyed it. I don't know how I felt

03:14.013 --> 03:15.074
then. But I don't remember any serious thoughts 
about the war, except that we wanted to go and be

03:15.635 --> 03:21.381
part of it. I think everybody did. We wanted to go 
and be part of it. Were there any events, world

03:25.025 --> 03:32.573
events or otherwise, that you remember while you 
were at A&M? Do you remember where you were when you

03:32.593 --> 03:35.016
heard the news? I remember President Roosevelt's 
death, which I guess everybody that was there did.

03:39.301 --> 03:40.422
Describe that, please. Coming back from lunch, I 
guess it was, from Duncan Hall, going back to dorm

03:40.942 --> 03:54.441
7, there was a newsstand, I guess between dorm 9 and 
the band dorm 11. I guess it was. And I remember

03:57.345 --> 04:01.811
hearing somebody had a radio or something and told 
us about it.

04:04.876 --> 04:09.362
I don't know if I was any more impressed than that 
one way or the other, that Truman was a successor.

04:10.574 --> 04:12.958
don't remember any other thoughts at this moment. 
One thing I don't know maybe you've never told

04:12.978 --> 04:19.028
about before, but there were concessions on the 
campus when we were there. Oh, no. The YMCA had a Y

04:20.230 --> 04:28.765
building, which I guess is still called the Y, and 
the basement had a soda fountain. I don't think

04:28.785 --> 04:31.209
there was a full drugstore, but a soda fountain, I 
know. And then under a big old tree in front of the

04:35.836 --> 04:44.728
Well, I see it would be to the north of the academic 
building near the ME building and the electrical

04:35.836 --> 04:44.728
engineering building, the big oak tree. And it had 
a stand there where we could get hot dogs and

04:44.748 --> 04:50.395
hamburgers and soft drinks. And we did a lot of that 
instead of going to the mess hall at noon. Or maybe

04:55.221 --> 04:56.323
just for snack. I guess for snack. And that wasn't a 
violation of any? I guess so. It was fully

05:01.970 --> 05:04.273
authorized by the university. I mean, it was okay 
for a freshman or a sophomore to- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

05:10.747 --> 05:13.830
I don't remember any problems coming up as a result 
of it. And were those the only places on campus to

05:15.072 --> 05:19.397
get a snack? As I recall, those were the only 
places. I don't remember any place else. I don't

05:25.605 --> 05:34.395
know of anything that did what the- There might 
have been, there was another male

05:25.605 --> 05:34.395
post office. near, behind, behind, not Walton, 
um, well, near what's, across from the trigon

05:35.270 --> 05:45.824
today. And, uh, I'm not sure, maybe it didn't have 
some drinks in there, but the only thing I remember

05:45.884 --> 05:59.621
about that is that we, uh, we had a dance before I 
left for service, and I had a date. At that time, I

06:00.022 --> 06:03.326
had started dating, which was interesting. I met 
her because... The guy that was a year ahead of me

06:06.202 --> 06:13.071
was having an argument with her in Houston one 
weekend. And he said, tell her how good a guy I am.

06:14.653 --> 06:17.777
Well, I went to tell her I ended up being here 
instead of him. But anyway, we sat on the male ramp

06:18.999 --> 06:24.046
that would be unloaded dock high level. And I 
thanked her. And if I were saying goodnight or

06:26.549 --> 06:31.375
something, that was the only time I really 
remember going over there. During those years

06:33.218 --> 06:35.601
before you left, Were there some memorable 
teachers, advisors, counselors that you recall?

06:41.905 --> 06:57.657
There was a Dr. Pinkerton, I don't remember his 
first name, who was head of the aero department

06:41.905 --> 06:57.657
when I finally started taking some aero courses, 
who we were always told was always in contact with

06:41.905 --> 06:57.657
the Department of the Army and the Air Force for 
research projects. And what was his name? Did

07:02.256 --> 07:03.757
Pinkerton have a nickname? That is out of my mind. 
If it is, prompt me, but I don't remember. I don't

07:07.682 --> 07:08.083
know. There was another fellow that was so bent 
over from arthritis, I can't remember his name. He

07:13.529 --> 07:14.751
was an excellent teacher. I can't remember his 
name. There was another guy. After that escapade

07:20.498 --> 07:23.722
at our freshman ball, I had an English teacher. I 
think his name was Greer. I'm not sure. I went into

07:28.012 --> 07:36.566
his class, 8 o'clock, I guess this was Saturday 
morning, and he had already been sick all night. He

07:36.766 --> 07:38.449
was going to give us a quiz that morning. Why he 
picked that morning to give us a quiz after our

07:39.090 --> 07:45.480
dance the night before was unfair, but it was done. 
And halfway through the exam, it was an English

07:45.865 --> 07:49.429
class. Halfway through, I told him I was sick and 
had to go outside. And the only time I ever saw him

07:52.913 --> 07:55.896
grimp was when I went outside. And then I came back, 
and I failed the course.

08:02.404 --> 08:06.489
He failed, I don't know how many, but most of us, 
many of us failed this course that year. Why we

08:07.490 --> 08:08.891
failed English, I don't know. All right, let's 
see. English grammar, I wasn't very good at. All

08:12.115 --> 08:14.758
right, other teachers I'm trying to provoke your 
thought chemistry, math. Dr. Harrington was my

08:16.645 --> 08:19.210
chemistry teacher. Describe him. M.T. 
Harrington. What kind of teacher? Brilliant

08:23.378 --> 08:24.079
lecturer. Very articulate, as you know, and knew 
him. Just made everything in the lecture class

08:32.440 --> 08:35.123
understandable, very easy to comprehend. I say 
very easy to comprehend since having had the same

08:35.143 --> 08:44.615
book in high school, I guess it made it easier, but 
just a very personable person. I didn't know him

08:45.737 --> 08:56.110
personally in those years, I met him in later 
years, but just very relaxed, easy, articulate

08:45.737 --> 08:56.110
person, easy to know. A guy I didn't get along with, 
Which is a bad experience that I can't remember his

09:00.132 --> 09:04.598
name offhand either. Did Harrington have a 
nickname? Not as I recall it yet. It was in the

09:09.004 --> 09:15.273
physics department and I failed the physics 
before I left for service, failed his class. We had

09:16.595 --> 09:21.101
a bad experience with him.

09:21.121 --> 09:27.490
Let's see, what were the expected rules of 
classroom behavior, appearance? Had to be in

09:28.391 --> 09:29.633
uniform. But beyond that, of course, 
well-shaved, haircut, and things like that,

09:30.980 --> 09:36.487
shoeshine. But beyond that, I don't recall 
anything else. Absences? They were very

09:41.152 --> 09:42.614
definitely frowned on. And we didn't cut many 
classes. No reason to cut classes during the week

09:48.501 --> 09:51.725
if there's no place to go or nothing to do. But 
Saturdays, it was very prone to be cut. And we did

09:54.748 --> 09:59.394
cut classes occasionally to go to weekends to 
football games. Sleeping? The only class I

10:01.760 --> 10:09.347
remember sleeping in was the lecture class about 
physics that I failed, which is probably why I

10:01.760 --> 10:09.347
failed. And there was an engineering drawing 
class called...

10:20.879 --> 10:22.420
It wasn't engineering drawing. It was a math 
course that we used. I can't think of the name of the

10:28.206 --> 10:29.607
course. But Ransdell was the teacher, a very good 
teacher, but it was right after lunch, and I

10:30.869 --> 10:35.981
couldn't stay away. Is Charles Ransdell? I think 
so. In engineering? Yeah. He later became head of

10:41.254 --> 10:47.308
the, not engineering design, but what is it now? 
Retired, lives in the eastern edge of Albuquerque

10:47.525 --> 10:50.269
now. Really? He was an excellent teacher, a nice 
person. Engineering distribution, industrial

10:55.157 --> 11:04.813
distribution, he was involved in that, and my son 
had him as the head of those departments or

10:55.157 --> 11:04.813
something.

11:04.833 --> 11:05.313
Let's see. Were there any famous visitors in these 
pre-war months that you recall? No, I don't ever

11:12.545 --> 11:14.528
remember recalling them. Alright, and when y'all 
went, you and your friends went somewhere for

11:15.014 --> 11:23.383
excitement, other than back home, where else did 
y'all go? Oh, we would go to downtown Bryan, we'd go

11:23.403 --> 11:38.760
to Eaton, Eaton, two or three cafes that were 
there, or we went to the movies, or we went to the

11:23.403 --> 11:38.760
campus theater, and they never will get, My first 
semester, I wouldn't have thought of it if you

11:40.732 --> 11:45.317
hadn't reminded me. The two late girls, young 
girls I suppose, singers, had vocal programs

11:45.337 --> 11:56.889
between movies and the campus theater at that 
time. They sang it. And one of the songs that I

11:58.231 --> 12:02.235
always remember singing, why they did it, was the 
Lillian Marlene. But why they sang a German song in

12:04.037 --> 12:07.060
those years, I don't remember. Describe the 
campus theater, as you would call it. Of course, it

12:12.279 --> 12:13.280
hadn't changed. It was still the only, except for 
Guy, the only theater there in the neighborhood.

12:22.794 --> 12:24.156
I guess it had a small balcony. I don't remember, 
but we all sat downstairs.

12:29.244 --> 12:31.707
Almost all students in the audience? Yeah, 
almost. I don't remember anybody else, but I'm

12:32.689 --> 12:35.072
sure there probably were. The building is a 
typical theater. I don't know how else to describe

12:37.503 --> 12:38.844
a theater. I guess you could call it kind of an Art 
Deco thing today, but I don't know if you could call

12:38.884 --> 12:45.712
it anything now. Describe the rest of Northgate 
and those drugstores. One of them was directly

12:52.460 --> 12:56.824
across the street. I don't remember the name of 
that one. And upstairs it had a... I had some pool

13:00.854 --> 13:05.881
tables, as well as marble machines. Behind it was 
Zubik's, where the uniform stores, and

13:07.523 --> 13:14.352
Lagerstein's, I think. Hollick's? Hollick's, 
instead of Lagerstein's. Hollick's. Zubik's and

13:17.336 --> 13:19.198
Hollick's. Across the street from that, on the 
opposite side, not on the campus, was another drug

13:19.218 --> 13:25.647
store with some marble machines. I had my first 
breakfast there on one Sunday. Hot dog, ham,

13:32.610 --> 13:39.362
hotcakes, and eggs on top of the Sunday side up.

13:42.748 --> 13:46.855
There was another place with a hamburger joint 
just to the south of there. And then Lupo's was

13:48.939 --> 13:50.942
there. And he, what did Lupo's say? Used new books 
and uniforms and anything he could get us to buy.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.812
Did y'all borrow, did you ever borrow any money 
from him? No, I had an allowance. I was fortunate to

14:04.775 --> 14:06.437
have an allowance. What kind of? Do you remember? 
Two

14:08.620 --> 14:16.350
to five dollars a week or a month. I don't remember 
now. But I kept strict. as I've mentioned for a

14:20.690 --> 14:27.258
while, and I think I've still got one of those 
summaries on what it kept for me. What activities

14:27.539 --> 14:30.182
were held at the YMCA? A lot of meetings were held 
there, class meetings. I'm sure there were church

14:37.071 --> 14:40.255
services there on Sundays. I don't know, they must 
have been. We had no chapel. Doesn't matter. I

14:48.054 --> 14:49.556
really don't know. Well, there was a bowling 
alley, I think, in there, too. But I never bowled,

14:52.840 --> 14:54.643
so I never went there. Well, all right. Then Guyon 
Hall. What held it? Guyon was a stately building

14:59.650 --> 15:03.155
with poor acoustics and hard chairs. And we 
watched the release of We've Never Been Licked

15:04.878 --> 15:07.882
there. They had other meetings there. Kind of the 
premiere? I don't know. Yes, it was, because they

15:14.453 --> 15:18.078
did the photography. Describe that. We all 
marched in and saw a movie, is the best I can

15:19.700 --> 15:22.663
describe it. We were up kind of in the balcony on the 
left side, which would be the east side of the

15:22.703 --> 15:30.573
building, as I remember. Dignitaries there? I 
don't remember. No, it was filmed before you got

15:34.698 --> 15:36.661
there. It was filmed before I got there, but I 
think, as I recall, we had the... A premium in there

15:41.133 --> 15:43.135
anyway. Do you remember any reaction of you real 
Aggies to- Corny. But maybe that could have come

15:47.841 --> 15:49.924
later too, I don't know. You thought it was corny? 
Yes. That was my reaction then or later, I don't

15:52.607 --> 15:56.712
know. But it sure definitely is. Let's see, were 
there any significant speakers, clergy,

16:07.559 --> 16:12.824
performers in Guyon that you remember during 
those years? I don't remember. They had them. I

16:16.327 --> 16:18.829
didn't go, I guess, because I don't remember it. 
Were there any religious activities held on

16:18.849 --> 16:21.431
campus? If there were, the only place would have 
been in the Y, that I can recall. I don't recall

16:27.557 --> 16:28.718
anywhere else. They did have some. At that time, 
the old synagogue was open in downtown Lyon. They

16:35.203 --> 16:37.245
had services there. I might have gone there one 
time, I think, for something. But that was all.

16:44.441 --> 16:46.965
Other than that, it was part of the holiday I went 
from home. That was close. And you've given a very

16:49.629 --> 17:00.646
positive reaction to me of the way you felt about 
the way you were treated in regard to being Jewish.

17:00.666 --> 17:00.926
Yeah. OK. Tell me about the diversity of the 
student body. Were there any Hispanics, any Asian

17:05.661 --> 17:09.346
that you recall? I don't recall any Asians offhand 
that I can recall. I think there were maybe a few

17:15.075 --> 17:28.714
Hispanics with the, oh I know there were because 
Fernando Zuniga was one of my good friends from

17:15.075 --> 17:28.714
Laredo.

17:30.955 --> 17:33.638
Gus Celaya was another one. C-E-L-A-Y. 
C-E-L-A-Y.

17:38.964 --> 17:40.566
Were they treated differently than you? Not that I 
know about. You don't remember any nicknames or

17:41.847 --> 17:45.071
stunts or pranks or anything? Not that I ever was 
involved in or heard about. Any Lebanese

17:47.894 --> 17:50.717
Americans? No halibutis, no? I don't recall 
anybody by those names anyway. And was the student

17:55.182 --> 18:00.608
body, do you remember anybody notable for being 
rich? Mm-mm. Couldn't know anybody. We were all in

18:03.195 --> 18:04.035
uniform. And after the war, I don't remember. I 
don't recall anybody having a car. Well, there

18:12.503 --> 18:16.006
probably were some cars in those days. Couldn't be 
kept on campus. All right. Special events. Was

18:22.752 --> 18:24.553
silver taps held? Silver taps was held. Of course, 
that was a religious moment. Everybody who paid

18:30.338 --> 18:38.128
strict attention to it, the whole student body, 
turned out for it at that time. And the lights

18:38.148 --> 18:39.390
definitely were off. It was held? At the flagpole 
in front of the academic building, which is then

18:42.374 --> 18:51.505
Military Walk, which was a street near Roswald. It 
was right in front.

18:56.572 --> 18:56.932
Muster? Muster. See, I got there, and the first 
mustard was in April of 44. And I didn't stay for

19:05.881 --> 19:06.923
that. I came to Houston because a friend of mine had 
had brain surgery. It was an all-sun Aggie, but he

19:10.128 --> 19:12.572
had quit school. He quit school. He was in the Air 
Force, and they laid him out because he had the

19:14.034 --> 19:16.438
brain. He discovered the tumor at that time. He was 
in the class of 45.

19:25.148 --> 19:28.954
another friend of mine in the class of 46, and I 
hitchhiked home to see him. I didn't stay for that

19:29.434 --> 19:33.280
first muster, which I always regret. Do you 
remember where it was held? Probably in Guyon, but

19:36.445 --> 19:41.112
no I don't, offhand. We've been into Warefield 
House too. Did you students, had you all heard

19:43.716 --> 19:47.121
about the Corregidor muster? I don't think I had 
heard about the Corregidor muster. I haven't run

19:52.655 --> 19:54.857
into anybody who had. I don't think I had ever heard 
about the Corregidor Muster. All right, yell

19:58.280 --> 19:59.281
practice. Where was yell practice held? Yell 
practice was on the steps of the Y. And held when

20:05.187 --> 20:08.330
during the week? Was it? Probably Tuesday and 
Thursday, but I don't remember specifically. But

20:13.756 --> 20:15.557
was there a midnight yell practice? Yeah, there 
was midnight yell practice. OK, and it was held

20:17.499 --> 20:18.640
there? Yeah, it was held there. All right, let's 
go. We were serious, so let's go now to a lighter.

20:26.897 --> 20:30.441
Tell me about, describe a football game day, home 
game. Home game? Take from the, from Friday night.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.890
Okay, at some point, no, we didn't do that until 
later. Make this T, that was later years. First

20:44.215 --> 20:50.522
year, I don't remember anything special except 
the yell practice. I don't think we marched in. I

20:56.350 --> 21:00.213
don't think we had any kind of review. We would go to 
the game. We'd sit in front. We'd stand as

21:01.875 --> 21:05.038
freshmen. I'll never forget losing to Texas. One 
of the Yale leaders at that time was a junior, Jack

21:11.764 --> 21:20.813
Knox, who was an association president and a 
renowned dermatologist, as you know. was one of

21:21.198 --> 21:22.800
the junior Yale leaders. And after we lost to Texas 
that year, I made an effort to find him and probably

21:22.940 --> 21:31.309
tell him it would get better. And we both cried a 
little bit and let it go at that. That was your first

21:37.075 --> 21:38.396
Texas game? Yes. No, the first Texas game as a 
student. As a student, yes, yes, yes. I had

21:43.001 --> 21:49.348
attended every, from 1939

21:51.725 --> 21:52.747
through 1975. I made every Texas game. I even got on 
leave to go overseas in time to come to the game. And

22:02.621 --> 22:08.150
then when I got home in time the next year to attend 
the game, first event I did, got home on a Thursday

22:02.621 --> 22:08.150
the game. I mean, on a Tuesday the game. On a 
Saturday the game was the following Thursday that

22:10.213 --> 22:15.100
I came home.

22:17.138 --> 22:23.131
Jack became one of my good friends as a result of 
that chance meeting after the game.

22:27.139 --> 22:30.326
You didn't have a car during those years. Now you go 
away to the war. Now you came back when? Came back,

22:39.295 --> 22:42.418
started back to school in February of 1947. 47. So 
you were away... I was away from... Almost three

22:49.084 --> 22:49.985
years. No, no. No, no. I was away from... Oh, no, no. 
45. 45. Yeah, two years. Two years. A year and a

22:55.310 --> 22:55.970
half. Okay. First of all, how had you changed? 
Well, I was much more mature in that respect. I had

23:05.319 --> 23:07.581
been in service and... I just knew I had grown up, 
been in service. Where had you served? There was a

23:15.066 --> 23:26.620
little town called Schlangenbad in Germany, 
which was maybe 30 miles from Wiesbaden, maybe 50,

23:15.066 --> 23:26.620
60 miles from Frankfurt, just a few miles from the 
Rhine River. Had a nice little aviation engineer

23:27.961 --> 23:32.167
headquarters. Our main project were to rebuild 
and build airfields.

23:39.083 --> 23:47.853
I worked in operations, and we'd go into East 
Biden, to the American Red Cross, and it was a nice

23:39.083 --> 23:47.853
place. I had ice cream there, fresh

23:48.755 --> 23:56.444
eggs, and in about eight months, we had got served 
there. Lived in a small hotel, two-door room. We

24:04.754 --> 24:08.398
didn't have any sheets, but we took mattress 
covers, sheets out of them. It was very nice. We

24:12.254 --> 24:19.485
could have laundry done for a couple of weeks for a 
bar or so. Buy most anything you wanted to for

24:21.568 --> 24:23.811
cigarettes. I sent members of them. Eventually 
bought things and sent home Dresden statuettes

24:27.056 --> 24:32.665
and Knives, carving knives and things I bought 
with cigarettes. My best friend there was a guy

24:39.595 --> 24:43.299
from Atlantic, Iowa. We had our picture taken for 
cigarettes

24:44.600 --> 24:52.468
and gum and candy. We had above the officer's club 
and headquarters, there was a swimming pool and a

24:52.488 --> 25:01.116
tennis court that we were able to use. We had a, my 
first involvement with really when printing was

25:02.665 --> 25:11.874
in that, we had a printing press there that they 
used for maps. Lithograph press. Right, and you

25:13.876 --> 25:14.837
served there? That was the only place I served 
actively. So you came back then? I came back from

25:19.181 --> 25:21.163
there, I guess my first. And you're how, what age 
when you got back

25:21.744 --> 25:26.749
to Indiana? Let's see, this was 47, so I guess I was 
20. And I got sacked. Very mature. And I'm

25:35.101 --> 25:40.450
thinking, I'm chuckling about the experiences 
you had had compared to today's 20-year-old.

25:40.610 --> 25:46.740
Well, they were 100% different, but thank God I had 
them because I, between A&M and the service, I grew

25:40.610 --> 25:46.740
up. You're still an aero engineer. Yeah. I still 
finished in aero because it was only three

25:51.588 --> 25:55.094
semesters instead of four. Right. Describe A&M 
physically then when you arrived the second time.

26:00.327 --> 26:21.351
The mob scene because all the classes were full and 
the dorms were full and I went back in the corps

26:00.327 --> 26:21.351
because I wanted to get a commission and ended up 
rooming with Dave Schwartz from Galveston which

26:00.327 --> 26:21.351
it was an accident but it was almost a purposeful 
accident. His older brother had been in the Navy,

26:23.108 --> 26:30.717
and I knew him physically, let's say, before he 
left for the Navy. So when he came back, I saw him, I

26:31.478 --> 26:36.725
knew him, and he told me that Babe had shown up on the 
campus. And so I found him, and we became

26:38.006 --> 26:41.791
roommates. And we're still best friends at this 
wedding. We're still good friends.

26:51.020 --> 26:55.848
But there was a mob scene that was all led by the big 
war vets. I never felt as a war veteran because my

26:55.988 --> 27:03.199
service was so easy as compared to what they had. 
And they were always the student leaders. We had

27:05.443 --> 27:06.985
many of them. The athletes who'd gone into service 
came back. Marty Welch, Willie Zappalak.

27:15.739 --> 27:16.420
I can't remember others right now. But they came 
back and they were, a guy named Bill Andrews was the

27:16.805 --> 27:32.947
one that I remember why I don't remember his name, 
but we had a big meeting over something important

27:16.805 --> 27:32.947
I'm sure in the old Wooden Assembly Hall.

27:35.791 --> 27:39.336
I don't know why I remember his name all of a sudden. 
Where did the married veterans live? They had

27:42.200 --> 27:44.483
converted dorms and barracks that were moved in at 
the, I guess it was the North Gate area, some on

27:45.509 --> 27:53.421
campus and some off campus. Were there trailers? I 
don't recall any trailers. How did you and your

27:58.069 --> 28:05.721
fellow veterans respond to a corps ritual? By that 
time I was an upperclassman and a senior. didn't

28:11.817 --> 28:12.979
bother me at all. I participated in all the core 
activities until I, for the first two semesters I

28:13.059 --> 28:32.425
was back and when I had one more semester I needed, I 
needed two military science courses to graduate

28:13.059 --> 28:32.425
and get commissioned and other courses so I went to 
the commandant. And they had permission to audit

28:33.147 --> 28:36.972
the courses and move out of the course so I could. I 
took the two military science courses, I think I

28:37.492 --> 28:43.840
took 24, 25 hours that semester. But the military 
science courses were easy having been in service

28:43.860 --> 28:50.007
and there weren't any problems. And I didn't put a 
uniform on until I went to take the test. I didn't

28:56.055 --> 28:58.598
have to drill because it concluded with labs. I 
already had it very easy that last semester there.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.077
So you're there how long? Three semesters. The 
last semester was the spring of about 48. Were

29:11.126 --> 29:14.251
there any faculty members from that period that 
you remember? Faculty members, advisors,

29:15.112 --> 29:17.275
counselors?

29:21.542 --> 29:25.167
That's when I had the professor that was Dr. 
Riddick. He was so spooked over, he couldn't

29:25.187 --> 29:28.552
straighten up. It started with a B. I keep thinking 
of his name still. Who was president then? I think

29:37.111 --> 29:38.574
Gilchrist was then president. It might have been 
Harrington for a while. No, I think it was

29:40.457 --> 29:41.880
Gilchrist. In that period of time. The most 
significant things I remember were two common

29:43.964 --> 29:48.292
laws. Though Davis had been retired or replaced 
for whatever reason, I don't remember. And Gaius

29:54.721 --> 30:05.697
Malloy was a commandant and a wonderful military 
person who he loved to follow if he had to go to

29:54.721 --> 30:05.697
combat. And then General Boatner, who became 
General Boatner, he went to Korea and settled the

30:07.060 --> 30:16.894
riots in the Korean prison camps very quickly. 
Describe his personality as you knew it. Oh, he's

30:19.418 --> 30:22.062
strong as horse radish. stocky, very military, 
very, I don't want to say Germanic in his military

30:22.615 --> 30:34.348
approach, very rigid. That's probably a better 
way to put it. Now, when you get back, the freshmen

30:36.310 --> 30:40.054
are all at Bryan Field.

30:42.737 --> 30:44.679
Weren't they there before I left, too? I don't 
know. I guess not because Bryan Field was used for

30:48.265 --> 30:50.227
For the military at that time. So I guess they were 
at Bryan Field that first semester. Did you

30:53.389 --> 30:55.951
upperclassmen interact with them much? Never. We 
might have been good drill with them, but that may

30:57.973 --> 31:01.636
be all. Were there still pranks and good bull with 
you upperclassmen only on the campus? I don't

31:08.642 --> 31:15.948
remember any drown outs specifically that I can 
remember at that point. Where I'm headed is, was

31:15.968 --> 31:17.850
there a difference in the basic attitude of you 
students.
