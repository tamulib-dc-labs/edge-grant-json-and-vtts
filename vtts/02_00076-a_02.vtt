WEBVTT

00:03.625 --> 00:11.414
But anyhow, Jack McCreary, my roommate, Wayne was 
responsible for his going to Harvard Business

00:03.625 --> 00:11.414
School. He touched a lot of students. 
Unbelievable guy. Did any of you or any of your

00:17.881 --> 00:25.050
acquaintances ever get the lecture from Wayne 
Stark that some students call the green couch

00:17.881 --> 00:25.050
treatment? I don't recall that. What I do remember 
about Wayne Stark, particularly when I became

00:26.832 --> 00:30.696
president of the association, And Wayne was still 
pretty active at that time. I'm not sure he was

00:34.703 --> 00:37.548
still director, but he was. One thing, he had a file 
system that would absolutely blow your mind. And

00:41.916 --> 00:44.702
he had a file on every student that had come into 
contact. Not the J. Edgar Hoover kind of file, but

00:46.625 --> 00:49.731
the kind of file that and just helped him get kids 
placed into graduate schools and things like

00:50.538 --> 00:55.042
that. He showed me those files one time. In fact, I 
was asking about some person. He said, well, let me

00:58.886 --> 01:01.048
show you this. And I was asking about some person. I 
put out the file, and I had the guy's professional

01:02.410 --> 01:06.974
history.

01:08.395 --> 01:12.700
That's

01:08.395 --> 01:12.700
just my main recollection of him. All right. Guyon 
Hall. Do you remember any activities in Guyon

01:15.202 --> 01:18.025
Hall? Oh, sure. What happened at Guyon Hall? Guy 
Hall was where we had, I believe, where we had a lot

01:20.542 --> 01:28.572
of the entertainers come in from Guy Hall. Elvis 
Presley came there as my freshman year. Buddy

01:34.740 --> 01:44.533
Holly, as I told you outside this tape, was my 
classmate in A&M, and I first saw Elvis Presley in

01:34.740 --> 01:44.533
Lubbock when he came in 1955 in the opening act 
where Elvis was Buddy Holly. The only time they

01:44.613 --> 01:46.195
ever appeared on the same stage. That was at A&M? 
No, no, at Lubbock High School. So I'd seen Elvis

01:50.870 --> 01:52.673
one time before A&M. I saw Elvis two times, one at 
Lubbock and one at A&M. Interesting side note

01:58.144 --> 02:09.887
there, when Buddy Holly opened up the Elvis 
Presley show, he went through these gyrations and

01:58.144 --> 02:09.887
he was looked by a local guy and was moved off the 
stage because everybody thought this high school

01:58.144 --> 02:09.887
nerd was trying to act like Elvis Presley. Little 
did we know that the guy was a musical genius. And

02:13.670 --> 02:18.436
it's absolutely revered in England, though, much 
more so in the United States. But Elvis Presley is

02:18.456 --> 02:19.877
one I remember. We had the four freshmen. I 
remember that because everybody called him Fish,

02:21.719 --> 02:23.781
the four fish.

02:28.066 --> 02:32.190
Matt Davis, also from another period one time, in 
somebody's place. He was just starting to make it

02:32.230 --> 02:33.271
big. I may be wrong about that. I might have seen 
Matt Davis after I graduated, but he came to the

02:35.754 --> 02:38.457
A&M. So the Guyon Hall and G. Raleigh White had just 
been constructed, so that was the place where we

02:39.128 --> 02:46.296
had the entertainers and so forth. Religious 
emphasis week, was that still going on when you

02:47.117 --> 02:50.441
were there? Yes, it was. Can you remember it? Can 
you describe it? The only thing that comes to my

02:54.105 --> 03:01.033
mind on that is that we, in our particular outfit, 
you had to go to church. You didn't have a choice,

03:01.053 --> 03:04.057
even if you didn't want to. Religious emphasis 
week. I remember we had it, and it was a routine

03:05.178 --> 03:08.882
thing all four years, but I don't... Most of us went 
to church anyhow. It wouldn't have been a deal.

03:12.505 --> 03:12.605
Yeah. Describe that. Where did the typical 
students go to? To whatever religion they were

03:16.591 --> 03:18.414
raised in. And where were those churches located? 
All around the campus. Everything Jewish,

03:22.701 --> 03:26.887
Catholic, Protestant. Obviously, most of us were 
Protestants. I went to the Indian Methodist

03:28.690 --> 03:30.453
Church there. I got a lot off the campus and just 
north of the campus there. Let's discuss student

03:33.418 --> 03:37.384
diversity.

03:38.056 --> 03:42.640
generalize about the student body in your day, it 
was basically what? Basically, part Anglo-Saxon

03:44.102 --> 03:49.707
Protestants.

03:49.727 --> 03:53.150
The biggest minority in him when I was there, and it 
was quite a sizable minority, were Hispanics. And

03:53.891 --> 03:54.992
how were they treated? It was kind of interesting. 
And it was very ethnic, and it was done in a very

03:58.915 --> 04:02.419
positive sort of way. If you were a Catholic, you 
were just lambasted. in a funny sort of way. If you

04:07.544 --> 04:13.630
had a girlfriend who was just marginally good 
looking and we were lambasted, it was above the

04:07.544 --> 04:13.630
kind of deal. Hispanics were treated like 
Hispanics but with a tremendous amount of

04:13.650 --> 04:18.595
respect. Because most of them came from very poor 
families down the border. First ones in their

04:27.483 --> 04:30.366
whole families to ever get an education. So they 
were treated with a tremendous amount of respect.

04:34.270 --> 04:35.451
Were there any Jewish students? Yes, a few. And how 
were they treated? It's kind of funny. Most of us

04:39.517 --> 04:42.261
didn't even know any difference between Jews and 
Protestants. We didn't know. You know, we'd been

04:42.741 --> 04:46.406
raised outside, far away from most Jewish people. 
So, to me, they're just like a Methodist or a

04:46.426 --> 04:50.411
Baptist or a Presbyterian. Were there any Asian? 
Virtually none. Virtually none. And, of course,

04:55.338 --> 04:56.759
we were undergraduates. At that time, the 
graduate school down here was very small. And, as

04:59.964 --> 05:03.328
you know, you get most of, a lot of your foreign 
students in the in graduate school. We did have,

05:05.956 --> 05:21.781
and we couldn't differentiate, we didn't have a 
lot of people of Latin backgrounds, and it was

05:05.956 --> 05:21.781
pretty hotbed then for people in South America, as 
well as Mexico, to send their, particularly in

05:05.956 --> 05:21.781
agriculture, more than engineering, to send 
their sons to A&M. So we had quite a few people of

05:22.462 --> 05:24.526
Latin backgrounds. And how were they treated? Oh, 
most of them were not the core. because they had no

05:28.469 --> 05:31.712
military obligation to the United States. So we 
didn't really associate with a lot of them, but

05:31.732 --> 05:34.294
they were civilians. No differently than anybody 
else. And I assume that almost everybody,

05:38.158 --> 05:46.946
faculty, staff, or student, had a nickname in 
those days. Just about. And were those nicknames

05:48.627 --> 05:51.730
intended to be negative or positive? It was more of 
the ethos of that day. You're always criticized in

05:58.102 --> 06:00.225
a good sort of way. The old saying is, I'd rather be 
criticized by friends than praised by enemies,

06:00.245 --> 06:05.291
and that kind of held true. The more they criticize 
you, the more they like you. In fact, I think they

06:09.536 --> 06:13.942
even put nicknames in the yearbook. I know they did 
for many years. Yeah, I think they did back in my

06:15.163 --> 06:17.226
time. Athletics. You mentioned the football 
coach. Tell me about football during your time.

06:24.495 --> 06:26.758
Well, football had gone from... And of course, I'd 
followed A&M football since the 40s. It

06:31.054 --> 06:32.456
languished in the early 50s. And then Bear Bryant 
came in in 1954. I entered A&M in 55. So I was there at

06:38.441 --> 06:46.690
the exponential growth of football interest and 
actually at the apogee at that time. Bear Bryant

06:47.190 --> 06:49.673
was coached at A&M three years out of my four. So it 
was the hottest thing on campus. Who were the

06:52.816 --> 06:56.239
famous football heroes in your Well, of course, we 
had to memorize the whole team as a freshman. I had

06:59.461 --> 07:00.823
to know everybody on the team. So an 
upperclassman, I'd sit next to an upperclassman,

07:00.843 --> 07:04.608
somebody would make a play, I'd have to tell them 
who it was. They wouldn't buy a program. They used

07:06.291 --> 07:08.253
freshmen for their program, let's say 50 cents. So 
I knew every person on the team, not personally,

07:09.375 --> 07:12.820
but just their numbers. Obviously, we had John 
Crow and Lloyd Taylor and

07:13.020 --> 07:22.834
Jimmy Wright. Charlie Krueger, those were some of 
the more famous. Who were those two guys that

07:27.468 --> 07:30.493
played in the two starting ends? John Tracy played 
one and Gene Stallage played one. Gene Stallage

07:34.560 --> 07:35.582
was an end. And then another end that was from 
Breckenridge was a fellow named Keith. Oh, Bobby

07:40.432 --> 07:41.533
Drake Keith. Sure. Bobby Drake Keith. Dear 
friend. Is that right? He's now president of what

07:44.978 --> 07:47.280
used to be Arkansas Power and Light. No kidding. 
It's Inter-G Arkansas now. Actually, Bobby Drake

07:50.244 --> 07:53.868
Keith graduated in about 57, as I recall, or 56. He 
was a little, he was not. He and Beebs were one year

07:55.671 --> 07:59.395
behind Crow. That's right. The Junction 
Survivors

08:01.618 --> 08:06.824
formed really the core team. They were the 
preceding class before the big recruiting teams.

08:10.199 --> 08:15.067
which that Bear Blount did in 55. So the class of 
those that came as freshmen in 56, or 55, I guess,

08:15.828 --> 08:25.944
were the ones who really propelled them to 
national status. Describe a typical home

08:25.964 --> 08:32.575
football Saturday of routine for a student. Well, 
if you're a freshman, you sit in the end zone with

08:32.815 --> 08:36.021
shaved heads and no girlfriend. That was kind of 
the tradition. Sophomore, you moved toward the

08:37.486 --> 08:40.651
goal line with maybe a girlfriend. Junior year, 
you moved about the 20-yard line with a

08:40.691 --> 08:43.855
girlfriend. Senior year, you maybe had two 
girlfriends, but sitting on close to 50, so it kind

08:44.817 --> 08:48.803
of been one year. We didn't watch any of the other 
games. Kyle Field held about 38,000 to 40,000 at

08:51.907 --> 08:54.951
that time. They just made the first edition of the 
new press box. It was kind of weird looking. Not a

09:00.419 --> 09:03.544
second debt, just an extension on the west side. 
Was there anything that happened on Friday

09:04.267 --> 09:06.590
nights? Oh, yeah, sure. We had the midnight yell 
practice. Describe that. Well, midnight yell

09:09.092 --> 09:11.195
practice would go to the Grove. And it was just a 
great time. Band marching in. He would have you, if

09:18.142 --> 09:20.925
you had a day chat, you'd go to midnight yell 
practice. It was a lot of fun. And then you'd

09:22.066 --> 09:25.830
normally have a dance Saturday night after the 
game. Did anything happen after midnight yell

09:25.911 --> 09:28.473
practice was over? Normally not. No, I'm not. We 
would go to individual parties or something, get

09:31.135 --> 09:38.402
back in about 3 o'clock in the morning, but nothing 
orchestrated after midnight kill practice. Then

09:38.422 --> 09:40.523
Saturday morning, what? Saturday morning, you 
could sack in, as I recall. I don't think you had a

09:42.966 --> 09:47.209
formation Saturday morning with a football game 
because you marched in the game. So you'd

09:47.269 --> 09:52.614
congregate around 10 or 11 o'clock and march in, as 
I recall. And since they were winning almost all

09:52.634 --> 09:56.717
those games, what happened at the end of the game? 
We'd throw you out there. At that time, You throw

10:00.106 --> 10:01.788
them in the fountain. I'm trying to think. We 
didn't have much of a fountain at that time. As I

10:04.992 --> 10:10.479
recall, we had kind of a little bowl deal over where 
the rudder center is now, which wasn't there at

10:04.992 --> 10:10.479
that time. And you just put them in that and you'd 
throw a bucket of water on them. It wasn't a big

10:13.363 --> 10:17.969
fountain, but it was the same kind of condition, if 
you won, which we normally did. And since the

10:18.830 --> 10:22.094
Aggies were winning, what happened after 
touchdowns? Well, you do the same as you do now. You

10:23.957 --> 10:24.898
kiss your date. Let's see, G. Raleigh, tell me 
about a basketball. Barry Brunn, I believe, was an

10:33.189 --> 10:38.116
athletic director when he first got there. I think 
that was part of the package. He brought in a guy

10:39.278 --> 10:45.287
named Bobby Rogers, who was, I believe it was Bobby 
Rogers. No, I'm sorry, it was one before he'd

10:45.367 --> 10:47.870
actually written a book. It was one before Bobby 
Rogers. From up at LaSalle. I think that's right.

10:53.667 --> 10:54.668
I'm trying to think of his name. I can't remember 
his name. But Bobby Rogers was coached most of the

10:55.690 --> 10:57.612
time I was there. I had one of the people at my 
wedding was a basketball player, a guy named Neil

10:58.293 --> 11:06.124
Swisher, who was also a civil engineer. He and I 
were classmates and went to a lot of classes

11:06.845 --> 11:09.809
together. Good friend, great basketball player. 
We had, I think, kind of a middle-of-the-run

11:12.913 --> 11:15.977
basketball team at that time. We weren't real bad, 
weren't real good. Did you all go to the games?

11:18.541 --> 11:19.422
Sure, went to every game. And what kind of special 
curriculum was there for athletes then? I had

11:26.288 --> 11:30.995
quite a few athletes in my class, Bear Bryant type 
athletes. Most of them are not scholars. I've

11:32.437 --> 11:39.107
heard that he recruited 100 kids in 1955, which we 
graduated on time. That's probably right. I think

11:39.908 --> 11:41.109
a lot more graduated.

11:44.274 --> 11:49.341
But most of the athletes took, he had a few 
exceptions. Most of the athletes were not, you

11:49.895 --> 11:53.720
know, were football players, took PE. Certainly a 
few exceptions. We had John Crow was a very bright

11:55.922 --> 11:59.346
guy, Charlie Milstead, an engineer. In fact, 
Charlie and I are kind of the same profession. And

12:03.571 --> 12:08.417
Stallings and... Gene Stallings was a good 
serious student. And Keith was a... Bobby Drake

12:08.718 --> 12:11.200
Keith was. I mean, there were certainly... 
Geologically... I'm talking about the class

12:12.682 --> 12:18.349
after that of the hundred, not the Stallings 
crowd. Other campus organizations for students,

12:19.223 --> 12:24.609
singing cadets, what were they like then? Great, 
great like they are now. Any of your friends in the

12:26.651 --> 12:28.052
singing? Very few. For some reason, other than 
Buddy Holly, I've never hung around people who had

12:29.314 --> 12:34.439
any musical talent. The band, describe it in your 
day. It was big for that time, I think about 150,

12:37.142 --> 12:43.228
something like that, members. Room band, white 
band. Did you all have a respect for the band?

12:46.972 --> 12:47.813
Certainly, a bit. In fact, a lot of my classmates 
were in a band. The student government, was it? I

12:56.643 --> 12:58.164
think it was kind of secondary, really. The campus 
centered around the Corps of Cadets. And you

13:02.369 --> 13:05.191
always had a president of a senior class, a 
president of a junior class. But the status in the

13:05.211 --> 13:10.677
Corps was far more of a factor than being an officer 
in the class. Student politics was just really, I

13:11.097 --> 13:16.062
didn't know the difference between Republican or 
Democratic, conservative or liberal, I mean. I

13:16.463 --> 13:17.224
just didn't know that. In terms of prestige, of all 
the extracurricular offices on the campus, the

13:17.244 --> 13:24.594
Corps ranked highest? Oh, by far. And then what?

13:31.002 --> 13:33.004
Probably where you were a distinguished student 
or not. That was a big deal. Or a distinguished

13:33.745 --> 13:35.287
military student. We were called DMS or a 
distinguished student. Yell leader, band

13:38.211 --> 13:39.813
commander? Yell leaders were always a different 
breed. Kind of a wild bunch of people. Most of the

13:46.653 --> 13:53.883
Yale leaders, with a few exceptions, were wild, 
uninhibited, non-scholars, great guys.

13:54.845 --> 13:57.148
Certainly true of my class, kind of smoky high. But 
Yale leaders were certainly respected. But

14:01.354 --> 14:14.793
again, I think the corps status emasculated all 
other, all other, how you go in a corps, not

14:01.354 --> 14:14.793
necessarily just the rank, but the designation's 
very important to you. Singing cadets? Were they

14:16.572 --> 14:17.433
around then? Sure. Thank you for asking that. 
Yeah, they were respected. Let's see. Don't

14:25.364 --> 14:33.015
reveal any secrets now, but were there said to be 
any secret fraternities around in your day? Not in

14:33.395 --> 14:34.276
my time. There was before I got there. It was a big 
scandal. I think it was called the TTs.

14:43.859 --> 14:45.862
But, and I never could understand that. When I was 
in high school, they had this great cataclysmic

14:46.082 --> 14:52.270
revelation of the secret fraternity, which I 
never really understood. When I got there, it was a

14:52.370 --> 14:57.397
non-issue, and the whole four years I was there, it 
never came up. Did the letters TT, did those

14:57.737 --> 15:01.001
letters stand for anything? Well, they called 
them true tools, but I don't know what it really

15:01.041 --> 15:05.387
stood for. A tool was a very derogatory word. Did 
you ever hear of the stickers? No. The swastikas?

15:10.864 --> 15:11.545
No, never heard of them. I've heard mention of that 
way back into the 20s.

15:18.556 --> 15:21.301
Let's see, you mentioned RVs. Tell me about how did 
one get into the RVs and what did it mean and what

15:21.862 --> 15:27.551
were the joys? Fabulous organization, fabulous 
organization. Yesterday, you had to have a 2.0 to

15:31.237 --> 15:34.622
get in. to even be considered being, it was out of a 
3.0 system, so it would be a 2.0 out of 3. So it would

15:39.780 --> 15:41.442
be a 3.0 under today. Yes, I guess a 3.0, but at that 
time it was 2.0. You had to have no blemishes on your

15:46.429 --> 15:48.071
record. You had to have some military bearing. I'm 
not sure there was any discrimination on what rank

15:52.497 --> 15:57.684
you were in the Corps, but that was certainly a 
factor. It was pretty rigorous. We were juniors,

16:01.029 --> 16:02.871
you had to be a junior to get in. And very few, I would 
say that 80% of the RVs at that time were juniors.

16:07.647 --> 16:09.389
Just a few stayed in as commanders. Rainbow one 
certainly being one, two later. And how many were

16:13.034 --> 16:18.080
admitted per year? I'm going to guess there were 
three platoons and probably about 20 or 30

16:18.200 --> 16:23.807
platoons. I was going to say about 70, 80, 
somewhere in that range with RVs. You had RV drill

16:28.252 --> 16:32.017
pretty regularly. It took a lot of time. I think you 
were really brought in more for your scholarship

16:34.475 --> 16:42.223
than for your military bearing, so they had to take 
these people and put them into a military

16:34.475 --> 16:42.223
position. Great perks, perquisites. Such as? 
Well, the biggest one, of course, was going to

16:47.488 --> 16:49.270
Mardi Gras. So we had, of course, going to New 
Orleans for Mardi Gras. Just an unbelievable deal

16:56.617 --> 16:58.159
for us. Describe that trip. Well, we stayed at a 
naval base. I can't remember the name of it. I'm

17:07.432 --> 17:07.912
trying to think. It's like Kim Johnson or 
something like that on Lake Pontchartrain. It was

17:13.959 --> 17:21.047
kind of interesting because there were very rigid 
requirements when you actually were going

17:13.959 --> 17:21.047
through drill. The official governor's escort, 
even back in those days, their cross-volunteers

17:21.788 --> 17:26.614
were. The thing I'll never forget is that we had a 
drill when we were marching into Mardi Gras, which

17:26.634 --> 17:33.962
was unbelievable. experience back in 1958. We 
slapped a rifle on the pavement and turned 90

17:37.769 --> 17:43.876
degrees and faced the crowd and went through a kind 
of certain routine. And you couldn't move your

17:45.338 --> 17:46.680
eyeballs. You couldn't do anything. It was 
strictly a rigid deal. And you would get gigged

17:49.243 --> 17:51.345
pretty hard if you did anything wrong. And we went 
through a routine where, of course, the crowd was

17:52.567 --> 17:57.232
right next to us. A rather drunken or reveling 
crowd. And I hit the pavement with my rifle and

18:03.372 --> 18:07.297
turned 90 degrees and faced the crowd. And there 
was a big female, a big tall gal dressed as a bunny.

18:10.582 --> 18:12.184
And she stuck a carrot in my mouth. So here I was with 
my R.E. uniform on and a carrot sticking out of my

18:14.227 --> 18:16.129
mouth.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.375
It absolutely broke me up. I left the rest of the 
deal there and I did pretty hard. I bit the carrot

18:24.901 --> 18:26.504
out, but I still do. I was so tickled I lost most of my 
discipline. No, that's a good story. But it's a

18:31.487 --> 18:32.548
true story. Anyhow, we had a great time. Did 
anybody do anything unusual after hours? Well,

18:39.576 --> 18:40.217
yeah. We all went down to Bourbon Street and saw 
things we'd never seen before, and it was kind of a

18:40.257 --> 18:47.205
big scene, but nobody got in bad trouble. Let's 
see. Define hazing. as it was practiced in those

18:54.605 --> 18:58.970
days at A&M? We were hazed. I would say, in 
retrospect, 90% of it was good and probably legal.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.741
What did it involve? Mainly just recollection, 
standing at a brace and sitting on a pink chair,

19:07.801 --> 19:19.976
which means you'd sit down at your knees at 90 
degrees on a clothes hanger for long periods of

19:07.801 --> 19:19.976
time. Good physical training.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.790
Just going through a lot of verbal hazing as a 
freshman. I got never hazed. I never hazed as a

19:30.012 --> 19:31.575
sophomore. And I kind of kid Ray Bowen that he made 
me do push-ups, which he did a lot as an RV. Ray made

19:37.383 --> 19:38.545
us do a lot of push-ups. I told him I still had a bad 
back, and I was thinking about initiating a

19:38.565 --> 19:44.173
lawsuit, but he said the statute of limitations 
had already cleared him. A lot of push-ups and

19:44.774 --> 19:46.156
things like that. I was beat one time with a board, 
grabbed a pooch, which I think he'll leave at that

19:47.418 --> 19:52.486
time. And it wasn't... It wasn't widespread. It 
was very settlement-type. Do you remember what

19:58.175 --> 20:01.139
the excuse was for that paddling? Had you 
supposedly done anything wrong? Oh, sure. Oh,

20:05.245 --> 20:05.645
yeah. You never really did anything seriously 
wrong. They just would find something that you did

20:07.127 --> 20:09.330
wrong. Do you remember anything that, by those 
standards or ours today, that was truly

20:10.392 --> 20:15.038
excessive? No. I really don't. And how often was 
that board used? Very seldom. It was used and it was

20:20.212 --> 20:22.235
illegal at that time. It was against core 
regulations at that time. Who were the key core

20:25.220 --> 20:32.552
advisor, commander professionals? General Joe 
Davis was the top guy, Colonel Davis. Describe

20:35.697 --> 20:36.358
him. Well, he was kind of, as I recall, kind of a 
nondescript sort of guy.

20:42.828 --> 20:47.856
Retired military and I don't think he made a mark on 
up or down, but nobody really paid much attention

20:48.460 --> 20:49.842
to him. The attack officers, which are mostly 
second lieutenants or first lieutenants, were

20:50.062 --> 20:55.588
the ones that we had most of the interface with. 
Colonel Joe would have all the right buzzwords,

20:58.311 --> 21:03.677
but I don't think he was really a force there, up or 
down. Alright, on the campus administration, who

21:04.799 --> 21:08.543
were the key people? The president and so forth? 
Well, we had an interim president my freshman

21:10.805 --> 21:13.188
year. I think who was a dean of agriculture or 
something like that. He was just kind of a stock gap

21:17.738 --> 21:19.179
guy. Then, of course, Earl Rudder came in in 1957. 
That was really, as you and I have discussed, off

21:21.041 --> 21:28.450
the record was kind of a cataclysmic event for A&M. 
Describe his coming and the reaction, if you

21:28.610 --> 21:34.157
remember any reaction. I remember very well. Very 
controversial, right up and down the line. And of

21:38.742 --> 21:42.827
course, the academics, the faculty didn't like 
him because he didn't have a PhD. He was strictly a

21:43.468 --> 21:45.130
political tool. Students didn't like him because 
he was a frog, which means, of course, coming in at

21:45.481 --> 22:00.062
midterm, which means you miss all the real hazing, 
which is the absolute zenith of naivety when you

21:45.481 --> 22:00.062
look at his World War II record. So he came in with 
just about universal negative perception on

22:00.283 --> 22:13.682
campus, all the way from the faculty to the corps 
cadets, which just shows you again how naive you

22:00.283 --> 22:13.682
are when you're young sometimes. Did he interact 
at all with the Corps, with the student body? Did

22:17.910 --> 22:18.991
you all see much of him? Frankly, I didn't too much. 
I think he was so overwhelmed when he got there. He

22:23.117 --> 22:34.352
came in as a land commissioner, as you know, 
Baskin-Giles problem here, and he came in with a,

22:23.117 --> 22:34.352
we all knew about that, we were cognizant of that, 
that he straightened out a lot of graft corruption

22:23.117 --> 22:34.352
here at the state level. So he had that degree of 
respect. But they just couldn't make the

22:36.134 --> 22:42.623
extrapolation between being a land commissioner 
and being a president of the a major university.

22:45.005 --> 22:51.831
Frankly, I don't think I ever talked with him the 
whole time I was at EM, nor very few of my colleagues

22:45.005 --> 22:51.831
did. I think he was so overwhelmed trying to get a 
fix on the job that he didn't interface with the

22:51.891 --> 22:56.274
students a lot at that time. As a former student, I 
had a lot of interface with him, obviously. But as a

23:01.579 --> 23:08.005
student, interfacing with the president was not 
one of our priorities and probably not one of his at

23:01.579 --> 23:08.005
that time. Were the project houses still being 
occupied by students then? Certainly. On both

23:12.353 --> 23:13.735
sides of the campus. Yeah, describe those. Well, 
they were just World War II barracks. And who lived

23:17.018 --> 23:18.380
there? Graduate students and married students. 
Okay. Let's see. Bryan Field had closed. Freshmen

23:26.429 --> 23:28.291
were no longer going out there. It was an Air Force 
base. Yeah, yeah. Bryan Air Force base. I think

23:30.974 --> 23:33.898
they used T-33 trainers. Let's see. Summer's job, 
your summer job was not a specific A&M-related

23:34.759 --> 23:39.424
job. How did you go back and forth from Lubbock to 
College Station? I didn't have a part of my junior

23:44.103 --> 23:46.466
year. So how did you get back? One time I took a 
train. That was because we had a terrible

23:51.252 --> 23:53.454
snowstorm. It was Christmas. Describe that. It 
was Christmas in Lubbock. I believe it was my

23:56.758 --> 23:57.760
freshman year. I know it was my freshman year. 
Christmas. And I drove in with some of our friends,

24:00.203 --> 24:04.047
some upperclassmen. A guy named Jerry Davis was a 
pole vaulter to him from Lubbock. And he Of course,

24:08.142 --> 24:10.686
lived the privileged life because he was an 
athlete. He had a car. So I would drive home with

24:11.608 --> 24:12.749
him. When we got to Lubbock over Christmas, we had a 
terrible snowstorm. This was the winter of 55, 56.

24:19.981 --> 24:23.807
The only way to get out of Lubbock was by train, so I 
took the train back. All-night train. Left

24:25.149 --> 24:28.995
Lubbock going from, actually, from L.A. to 
Houston. Santa Fe, and I took the train back, and it

24:29.015 --> 24:33.222
dropped us off at Caldwell. But other than that, I 
would drive. How'd you get from Caldwell to the

24:36.851 --> 24:38.333
camp? Hitchhike. Tell me about Aggie 
hitchhiking. Well, it was widespread in those

24:40.756 --> 24:44.622
days. If you had a uniform on it, it sure sent you to 
go ride with somebody responsible. You wouldn't

24:48.587 --> 24:51.191
think of it these days, but we hitchhiked a lot. My 
freshman and sophomore year, my grandparents

24:52.032 --> 24:56.057
lived in Austin here, so I spent a lot of time in 
Austin. I eventually had a girlfriend down here,

24:56.077 --> 24:58.821
so I hitchhiked all the time. Where was the 
favorite hitchhiking location? near the campus

25:02.648 --> 25:04.911
in order to go to Austin? Right over there,

25:04.931 --> 25:24.640
well, Highway 6 if you're going to Houston, 
obviously, but if you weren't, right over where

25:04.931 --> 25:24.640
the Doodyville Ag Building is, right over that 
railroad hump, you'd hitchhike on that, but you'd

25:04.931 --> 25:24.640
get back over to,

25:04.931 --> 25:24.640
gosh, I forgot the highway number that went to 
Bastrop. Was there a protocol for Aggie

25:25.361 --> 25:27.824
hitchhiking? Not particularly. But if you're 
already there and I come up Can I go out in front of

25:32.838 --> 25:34.060
you? No, you stand in line. But there normally 
weren't more than, I don't recall more than three

25:35.301 --> 25:39.147
or four Aggies. Normally you picked up with one 
car. Did rank matter? Class? Not that I recall. I

25:44.634 --> 25:47.238
understand that it... No, I never heard of that. 
Did you ever hear of anybody having any problems

25:47.258 --> 25:50.242
hitchhiking? Not one time.

25:53.647 --> 25:54.868
And today we'd be horrified. You know, it's 
funny... Normally the hitchhikers are more at

25:59.095 --> 26:06.105
risk than the one driving the car because I've 
hitchhiked with a couple of grumps a few times and I

25:59.095 --> 26:06.105
was always kind of nervous.

26:09.250 --> 26:15.358
But today the driver of the car probably is more at 
risk than the hitchhiker, but in those days the

26:09.250 --> 26:15.358
hitchhiker was the one at risk. All right, now this 
was an all-male campus in those days. Where did an

26:18.002 --> 26:19.885
Aggie get a date? Well, various places. The myth is 
that Texas Women's University or TSCW at that

26:22.088 --> 26:27.836
time, I knew very few Aggies who dated Galsmer. 
Most of us. I made migrations down here at the

26:29.251 --> 26:31.856
University of Texas. My mother had gone here, had 
strong ties with UT, to today. I just loved the

26:37.205 --> 26:40.370
place, and they had the best looking women, I 
thought. Were Aggie, was it okay for a UT female to

26:40.491 --> 26:47.162
date an Aggie? Not, you know, I tell you, it was a 
little bit of a stigma. They caught a lot of flack.

26:51.897 --> 27:21.718
the girls did the girls the UT girls they used to 
call it a flag but by and large not too much the male

26:51.897 --> 27:21.718
students at UT really looked down upon us big time 
as being the country cousins which is not just true

26:51.897 --> 27:21.718
in Texas it's true in almost any land grant school I 
hear the same stories when I talk with people from

26:51.897 --> 27:21.718
Auburn for example or other land grant schools as 
compared to the main university Iowa State Kansas

26:51.897 --> 27:21.718
State it was mostly now when you came over to Austin 
what did you wear Oh, I'd always be in civilian

27:22.407 --> 27:25.691
clothes. In other words, the rules were as a 
freshman, you'd have to be 20 miles off campus

27:25.751 --> 27:30.197
before you'd get out of your uniform. I think as a 
sophomore on, you could hitch out in on red, but

27:30.397 --> 27:35.083
you'd put a uniform on because it's easier to get a 
ride. But as soon as we got off campus, I might come

27:35.904 --> 27:42.112
in my uniform all the way to my grandparents' house 
here in Austin, but as soon as I got there, I

27:35.904 --> 27:42.112
changed. When a young lady came to College Station 
for a date, where did she stay? Well, there were

27:47.519 --> 27:49.461
hotels around. and a lot of private families, 
private homes or places, but mostly we'd keep them

27:49.897 --> 27:55.444
in hotels. There weren't too many around, but 
there were a lot of motels. What were the special

27:57.506 --> 28:00.390
events for which you would want to have a date? 
Well, they had the junior ball, the sophomore

28:00.811 --> 28:06.177
ball, the military ball, and the rain dance. Those 
were the big three. Where were those held?

28:08.961 --> 28:09.561
Describe them. Mostly Spesa, Spesa Hall. They 
were just like they were back in the 20s, 30s. I

28:13.707 --> 28:17.271
think Spesa Hall had been probably the site of 
more... dances and parties at A&M than any other

28:18.331 --> 28:23.479
building in history or past, present, or future at 
A&M. But those were the three that were the big

28:24.901 --> 28:26.865
occasions. How did you Aggies behave at one of 
those dances? Oh, like gentlemen. Did young

28:32.273 --> 28:34.136
ladies enjoy coming to? Oh, blew their mind. 
Absolutely blew their mind. Just today. And what

28:38.784 --> 28:39.565
did they wear?

28:42.830 --> 28:45.975
Well, when you look at those formals, you know, 
which are about 10 feet wide at the bottom and Two

28:46.445 --> 28:50.230
feet wide at the top, there's just a lot of fluff and 
colors and all sorts of things. Typical 50s deal.

28:52.573 --> 28:55.817
50s was my favorite decade of my lifetime. Let's 
see. Describe the community of College Station

28:56.979 --> 29:00.864
around the campus. Describe what was at Northgate 
and Southgate and Eastgate. Actually, I'm pretty

29:04.930 --> 29:07.313
well qualified to do that. I married a Bryan girl. I 
call it the Bryan girl, whose father was a

29:08.114 --> 29:14.983
contractor who built a lot of the buildings in and 
around the campus at College Station. So after I

29:15.672 --> 29:26.088
got married, which was one year out of A&M, I really 
kind of learned just a lot from him, a lot of the

29:15.672 --> 29:26.088
community life in both College Station and Bryan. 
College Station was strictly a college town. I

29:28.071 --> 29:36.423
imagine that 80 or a very high percentage of the 
people who lived there were associated in one way

29:28.071 --> 29:36.423
or the other with the college. Bryan was a little 
bit different. Bryan was an old East Texas town. It

29:39.588 --> 29:42.372
didn't have quite as strong ties to A&M as College 
Station did. But even then, it was really

29:42.942 --> 29:45.784
basically one metropolitan area. Brown was about 
20,000, 30,000, and College Station was probably

29:46.645 --> 29:50.488
6,000 or 7,000. But you could hardly tell the 
difference between the two communities. But what

29:55.032 --> 30:03.119
was there, if you wanted to walk off campus, what 
was there to eat or entertain? It was bad. It was

30:05.481 --> 30:06.242
grim. I only remember two eating places that you'd 
ever want to eat at off campus. A place called

30:09.865 --> 30:12.026
Zaropi's, which was a Mexican food place. Where 
was that? It was close to the campus. I don't

30:14.735 --> 30:15.917
remember exactly where it was. Probably a little 
bit, as I recall, it was east of Highway 6. And on big

30:20.503 --> 30:27.392
occasions, we'd go to Zaropi's or Werman's, 
W-H-R-M-A-N, Werman's, which is a chicken fried

30:20.503 --> 30:27.392
steak place. And you'd get a chicken fried steak 
that'd cover a whole plate for a buck. So those were

30:31.418 --> 30:35.483
the two places, the only two places I had any 
recollection of eating off campus. Was Lupo yet in

30:35.503 --> 30:37.125
business? Oh, sure. Where was he at? Well, Lupo had 
the same place over there in... Northgate.

30:43.783 --> 30:44.224
Northgate. In fact, it's kind of funny, when I was a 
senior in high school and had been accepted at A&M,

30:45.004 --> 31:05.645
and I used accepted kind of loosely because it 
didn't take too much to be accepted, but I started

30:45.004 --> 31:05.645
getting all this mail from vendors around campus, 
and Lupo was the only one whose advertisement said

30:45.004 --> 31:05.645
he would take 50% off on books, and all of them said 
40%, so I went to Lupo's. And the first thing I did

31:05.665 --> 31:09.169
when I got on campus was to buy all my engineering 
books at Lupo's. That was a 55. Did you ever meet

31:11.317 --> 31:12.198
him? Oh, sure. Describe him. Oh, gosh. 
Personality. Oh, he was a back slapper. He had

31:17.544 --> 31:19.406
friends in high places. He was kind of funny. I 
don't think he ever achieved economic greatness

31:22.229 --> 31:28.836
or intellectual greatness, but everybody liked 
him. He was just the main figure on the campus, kind

31:28.876 --> 31:32.980
of like Pinky Downs was before I got there. 
Actually, Pinky was still alive when I got there.

31:35.964 --> 31:37.725
Lupo would always be the center of attraction. 
We'd come into a football game, knew everybody's

31:37.765 --> 31:40.108
names. Helped, tremendous help to the freshman in 
particular. You mentioned Pinky Downs.
