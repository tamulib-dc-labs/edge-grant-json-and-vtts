WEBVTT

00:00:02.579 --> 00:00:07.785
change the realities of graduate programs?

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:22.821
Well, we had one guy who had his computer burned twice and lost his dissertation twice in the computer.

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:32.552
And we actually gave him an extension over his deadline to get it in, because it was an honest problem.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.644
It put a lot of typists out of business.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:50.785
Because even Piper could write a dissertation now and correct it and get it within the lines.

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:58.379
Did the average student begin to type his or her?

00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:00.362
I think.

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:11.078
I would guess probably at least 75%, if not more, with their own dissertations.

00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:20.547
Once computers became... Now, did they still submit their proposals during all your years?

00:01:20.607 --> 00:01:26.273
Did they still send a copy of their thesis or dissertation proposal to the graduate college?

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.155
Yeah, we had to approve it.

00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:33.583
And did you all also see a copy of the finished product, the thesis?

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:34.967
You didn't see that?

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:39.017
The thesis edition clerk would take care of that.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.553
And then they had to send an abstract to the

00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:58.841
organization that published the abstracts of all the dissertations.

00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:12.553
What were some of the memorable excuses that graduate students and or their director made for some of the problems they supposedly encountered?

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:17.818
There must have been some incredible

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:22.217
Any excuses for not meeting a deadline?

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:36.259
Really, there weren't very many excuses until we had the time limit on master's and doctoral degrees.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.205
And then people began to make all kinds of excuses.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:45.072
The number of years between the time they started and the time they must finish.

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:48.698
I can't remember what it was exactly.

00:02:48.738 --> 00:02:57.313
I think it was six years for a master's and nine years for a doctorate, which is a lot of time.

00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:00.579
What were some of the goofy excuses?

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:09.895
Well, one that I didn't think was very goofy was a fellow who was a sack pilot and was getting a degree.

00:03:13.823 --> 00:03:16.546
because of his flight schedule.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:26.478
And we took all of those types of things to the Graduate Council.

00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:31.543
We didn't feel like an individual should make that sort of a decision.

00:03:31.564 --> 00:03:32.705
And they turned him down.

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:41.535
The guy with his burning computer was pretty easily

00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:50.646
I can't remember very many other excuses.

00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:57.234
Do you remember any problems that women had in the graduate programs here?

00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:01.639
Only one of my students.

00:04:03.582 --> 00:04:06.806
But no, honestly, I don't know of any.

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:08.368
What about minorities?

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:16.197
We had, matter of fact, I just threw away the federal court

00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:19.147
proceedings the other day.

00:04:20.088 --> 00:04:42.319
We had one student who was a minority, failed his prelims twice, claimed that his chairman was biased, so we backed down and let him get a new chairman in a new committee.

00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:48.010
He failed his prelims again and still didn't get the picture.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:05:04.785
And I dropped him from graduate school, and he went to federal court and filed suit for discrimination.

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:11.571
And I think he named everybody in the university.

00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:12.272
Actually, there were

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.315
two pages, two columns of two-page names.

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:27.624
And the system attorney sent me a copy and I read that thing three times and I never did find my name.

00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:34.050
I found everybody else in the school, but nothing ever came of it.

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:38.715
And then we dropped another guy who

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:50.728
I can't remember what his problem was, but he claimed we, he wasn't a minority either I don't think.

00:05:51.889 --> 00:06:08.432
But his case actually came to federal court in Houston and Vanderbilt was the other one

00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:34.182
but several of us were down there as witnesses, and they started the proceedings, and of course the witnesses can't go into the courtroom, and neither could Vanderbilt, I don't think.

00:06:35.584 --> 00:06:43.633
But anyway, the judge heard the attorneys for the plaintiff,

00:06:46.567 --> 00:06:52.312
So we all went out to lunch together and celebrated.

00:06:52.332 --> 00:07:00.119
Do you remember any attempted fraudulent dissertations or thesis matters that you all had to deal with?

00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.663
No.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:12.410
No plagiarism, data copying and so forth that was inappropriate?

00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:14.552
I can't remember any.

00:07:14.993 --> 00:07:16.354
There may have been some.

00:07:16.823 --> 00:07:22.891
I think probably a committee would take care of that before it ever got as far as a graduate college.

00:07:26.216 --> 00:07:35.048
In hindsight, during those years, is there any process that A&M should have been doing that it wasn't, or were we doing it about the right way?

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:36.871
I think we were doing it about right.

00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:41.177
I'm proud of what we did.

00:07:42.457 --> 00:07:47.562
Now did you have any assistant dean or associate dean?

00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:52.247
Yeah, I had an associate dean, Frank Clark.

00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:54.270
From what department?

00:07:56.152 --> 00:08:07.924
He was from industrial education, which doesn't exist anymore, and I had a lady from

00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:18.905
geography, but actually she was an anthropologist.

00:08:18.925 --> 00:08:19.546
I'll be blessed.

00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:20.587
I can't tell you more.

00:08:20.608 --> 00:08:21.589
Well, we'll get it later.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.532
And what were their duties?

00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:40.138
Well, they approved degree programs and thesis proposals and dissertation proposals and that sort of thing.

00:08:42.532 --> 00:08:56.471
Frank handled admissions, and I actually worked on degree programs from science and geoscience.

00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:01.058
You're talking about proposed new degree programs.

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:09.349
I think Frank handled all admissions.

00:09:09.886 --> 00:09:20.097
Now during those years that you were associate dean and assistant dean, our graduate admissions grew greatly in number and in breadth.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:38.678
Was our growth in terms of the makeup of the student body, lots more international students, was there anything different about our growth and progress from other major public institutions?

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.671
I don't think so.

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:50.242
I think all of them were growing then because research money was easy to get.

00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:53.085
And where was that research money coming from?

00:09:53.125 --> 00:10:02.657
National Science Foundation primarily in the sciences, Department of Education I guess

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:06.946
and Education and Department of Agriculture and Agriculture.

00:10:08.468 --> 00:10:10.490
That's the biggest boondoggle in the world.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.691
Most of it was federal?

00:10:12.352 --> 00:10:15.155
Yeah.

00:10:15.175 --> 00:10:17.497
Agriculture, I don't know.

00:10:17.537 --> 00:10:20.300
Those people get money and travel around.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.745
I don't know where it comes from.

00:10:25.446 --> 00:10:31.412
They always have a big agriculture budget, and it's supposed to go to farmers, but I don't know where it goes.

00:10:32.692 --> 00:10:41.803
Now, you participated in all of the administrative sessions.

00:10:42.504 --> 00:10:49.513
You, as dean of the graduate school, had the same status as the deans of each of the academic colleges.

00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:59.465
During those years that you were either associate dean or the dean, which other college dean had the most influence?

00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:01.247
Was there any college that

00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:06.149
Like agriculture, engineering, did they have more wallop than?

00:11:06.189 --> 00:11:10.534
It depended on the particular person.

00:11:11.535 --> 00:11:17.281
I think it was a personality thing more than money or number of students.

00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:19.023
Which persons?

00:11:19.784 --> 00:11:23.928
I'd say Fred Benson was rather influential.

00:11:23.948 --> 00:11:24.489
Engineering?

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:25.450
Engineering.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.810
Why?

00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:28.453
I think I know the answer, but why?

00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:32.517
I think he shouted the loudest.

00:11:33.307 --> 00:11:40.454
I've always thought he fought his battles carefully.

00:11:41.175 --> 00:11:49.363
Well, he did that, but he fought some battles that shouldn't have been fought.

00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:52.666
Who else?

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.073
Science had a pretty influential deal.

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:18.849
Corrigan seemed to be influential, primarily from his ability to debate, I think, more than anything else.

00:12:18.869 --> 00:12:31.005
I was probably the least influential.

00:12:31.357 --> 00:12:43.531
bureaucracy, hierarchy was never a factor in the real world of the graduate school, was it?

00:12:46.034 --> 00:12:49.378
Let's see, women, minorities, fraud, technology.

00:12:54.364 --> 00:12:57.448
Let's see, goofy moments, silly moments you remember?

00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:05.959
There's one I've done involved with graduate college that I think is hilarious.

00:13:05.979 --> 00:13:09.223
Do you remember Professor Whiting?

00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:10.725
Yes, Whiting.

00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:11.646
Did you know his son?

00:13:12.547 --> 00:13:13.248
Don't believe so.

00:13:13.308 --> 00:13:20.316
He was sort of a character.

00:13:21.197 --> 00:13:29.106
He came trips and into the Zachary building one day barefoot in shorts and a t-shirt.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:37.041
And Dean Benson did not like people with barefoot in shirts and t-shirts.

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:46.096
And he was up on the balcony in the Zachary building and he shouted down, hey you.

00:13:46.977 --> 00:13:54.469
And Bobby looked around and didn't see anybody and started to walk again, you in the barefoot.

00:13:57.284 --> 00:14:00.447
And he said, is that you, God?

00:14:01.868 --> 00:14:06.713
And at that point, Benson didn't have anything more to say.

00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:09.475
Oh, that's a good one.

00:14:09.555 --> 00:14:11.937
That's a good one.

00:14:13.058 --> 00:14:13.559
Let's see.

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:19.124
Do you remember, excuse me, go ahead.

00:14:19.144 --> 00:14:21.266
I can't remember any goofy moments.

00:14:21.646 --> 00:14:26.751
What about serious, serious and or tragic moments?

00:14:27.187 --> 00:14:33.475
people who would get abusive to the staff and we'd have to go out and calm things down.

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:35.958
Example?

00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:46.931
Oh, they'd want something that they couldn't provide and they'd get upset.

00:14:47.211 --> 00:14:50.595
I can't think of exact things.

00:14:51.577 --> 00:14:53.599
We actually had to call a campus

00:14:54.136 --> 00:14:58.501
please one time to remove a graduate student from the office.

00:14:59.022 --> 00:15:00.503
I don't know what his problem was.

00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:01.885
He was just upset.

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:22.388
Was it a graduate college junior staff young woman working on a Saturday morning that got threatened with rape in the hallway of the Teague building?

00:15:24.697 --> 00:15:26.339
Gosh, I don't know anything about that.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.067
Let me turn this back to, do you remember any tragic or serious?

00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:39.537
No.

00:15:39.557 --> 00:15:44.703
Well, there are always tragic things in graduate programs.

00:15:44.723 --> 00:15:50.451
Some people fail, but I don't remember anything.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:58.558
And no legislator or rich parent or anything ever called you or anybody else?

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:00.680
No.

00:16:00.701 --> 00:16:03.263
Any special favors that anybody ever asked for?

00:16:03.303 --> 00:16:03.384
No.

00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:08.710
To let this student get admitted or anything like that?

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:17.279
The only one I can ever think of was my own.

00:16:17.299 --> 00:16:18.801
Kunji had a...

00:16:20.738 --> 00:16:32.550
policy if somebody had 1,200 on the GRE, he'd let them in regardless of their undergraduate record.

00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:37.855
My son-in-law had a potential son-in-law.

00:16:38.436 --> 00:16:39.777
No, he was my son-in-law.

00:16:39.817 --> 00:16:49.227
He had a pretty good record, but he started going out with my daughter, and that semester

00:16:49.898 --> 00:16:51.160
grades plunged.

00:16:52.642 --> 00:17:00.473
And he had an 1170 on the GRE and a 2.8, I think, or a 2.9, and I let him in.

00:17:02.596 --> 00:17:04.178
I told George about it later.

00:17:04.238 --> 00:17:10.026
He said, well, I probably would have done the same thing.

00:17:10.047 --> 00:17:16.075
But that's the only time I can ever think of that we warped

00:17:19.126 --> 00:17:35.523
And I, truthfully, I was never approached by anybody other than somebody in the department to let somebody in.

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:45.454
Did any of the programs in those days have a numerical ceiling that normally they would admit only so many per year?

00:17:50.615 --> 00:17:52.758
I think so, but I couldn't name one.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:58.207
Some of the departments just got so many students.

00:17:58.227 --> 00:18:04.517
Chemistry, for example, had, I don't know, 175 students, something like that.

00:18:04.537 --> 00:18:06.159
They just had the faculty take care of them.

00:18:07.221 --> 00:18:10.787
Right, and you think that A&M was truly making progress in those years?

00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:12.990
Oh, yeah.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:18.158
Did other schools give, did you have colleagues elsewhere

00:18:18.442 --> 00:18:23.107
in higher education that gave the impression they thought A&M was moving forward also?

00:18:24.628 --> 00:18:26.971
Yeah.

00:18:26.991 --> 00:18:35.099
In hindsight, is there anything we could have done more of or done better in those years that we?

00:18:41.565 --> 00:18:48.432
The only thing that we could have done that would have improved things was to establish

00:18:51.888 --> 00:18:54.391
We had quite a few of those, actually.

00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:55.532
But you mean just more?

00:19:01.339 --> 00:19:07.627
If you can support a good student, he'll come to your institution rather than going to another one where he's not supported.

00:19:11.051 --> 00:19:15.296
And there's not anything you can think of that you personally wish you had done?

00:19:15.336 --> 00:19:18.199
No.

00:19:19.597 --> 00:19:24.902
Well, as you, let's see, 1984 is when you retired as dean?

00:19:27.144 --> 00:19:27.585
87.

00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:28.265
87.

00:19:29.406 --> 00:19:36.193
How did you feel as you were completing more than 20 years of service at A&M?

00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:46.903
Well, they asked me to make the response for the

00:19:50.815 --> 00:20:02.489
I turned them down because I knew I'd break into tears, and I would have.

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:11.139
Matter of fact, they had a retirement party for me as graduate dean, and it was all I could do to say thank you.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.062
Where did they have it?

00:20:13.903 --> 00:20:16.085
Over in the MSC.

00:20:16.145 --> 00:20:17.407
And was there a special gift?

00:20:18.288 --> 00:20:20.130
Yeah, a couple of books.

00:20:21.916 --> 00:20:27.726
I hope they teased you about a few things.

00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:31.052
Did they attempt any humor or teasing?

00:20:31.653 --> 00:20:36.001
I think so, but that whole thing's a big blur to me.

00:20:38.866 --> 00:20:43.654
Let's see, did I just ask you is there anything you wish you had done now that you didn't do?

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.049
You've asked me.

00:20:46.269 --> 00:20:49.334
I don't think so.

00:20:49.935 --> 00:20:51.718
What have I left out?

00:20:51.778 --> 00:20:53.240
What have I not covered so far?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.527
I've just about run out of questions.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:59.249
I think you've covered everything.

00:21:00.672 --> 00:21:12.510
If you were Texas A&M's consultant now about graduate programs here at Texas A&M, what advice would you give them?

00:21:14.448 --> 00:21:21.639
I would reestablish a graduate college and give it the clout that it had back in the old days.

00:21:22.561 --> 00:21:22.861
Why?

00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:24.303
I agree with you, but why?

00:21:24.964 --> 00:21:40.168
Well, I think departments are admitting students, foreign students in particular, primarily to do research, and they don't care too much whether they get a degree or not.

00:21:53.767 --> 00:22:08.323
let the quality slip, and they just need to have somebody watching over them other than their own dean.

00:22:08.343 --> 00:22:16.531
Do you think there are any areas where we are not doing real graduate work that we ought to?

00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:22.778
What do you mean?

00:22:23.062 --> 00:22:30.129
Well, are there some areas that a school like Texas A&M ought to be doing graduate work in that we're not?

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:39.559
Oh, I don't think so.

00:22:41.181 --> 00:22:48.969
They want to do graduate work in humanities, but A&M's not that kind of school in my mind.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.393
See, I'm on your side like in the music and the fine arts.

00:22:52.677 --> 00:22:58.245
I like music and I like all the fine arts, but that's not part of our background.

00:22:58.265 --> 00:23:11.523
Well they ought to have a program that teaches music and teaches fine arts and teaches liberal arts type things, but they sure as heck don't need a degree program.

00:23:11.543 --> 00:23:12.084
There you go.

00:23:12.364 --> 00:23:13.686
There you go.

00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:20.676
But I think that engineers and scientists need to be exposed to that sort of thing.

00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:27.938
All right, then any other advice you would give to the administration?

00:23:30.521 --> 00:23:32.144
Yeah, build on your strengths.

00:23:34.227 --> 00:23:41.999
Don't try to emulate some other university or college because they're looked on highly.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.650
Should A&M attempt to make its graduate programs larger numerically than they are now?

00:23:50.879 --> 00:24:01.089
I don't have the slightest idea how big they are numerically now, but I think they should always try to increase graduate students.

00:24:04.212 --> 00:24:14.641
I don't think they should increase graduate students simply to get teachers for the undergraduate programs.

00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:20.667
I think they ought to build their graduate programs to

00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:32.806
And unfortunately, that happens.

00:24:33.507 --> 00:24:35.210
MIT is a good example of that.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:44.602
And that's one school that they keep talking about becoming, the MIT of the Gold Coast.

00:24:44.622 --> 00:24:44.942
All right.

00:24:45.022 --> 00:24:54.214
Then my last question is, let's make believe that somebody gave you a check for a million dollars or more with one requirement.

00:24:54.937 --> 00:25:01.606
that you must pass that on to Texas A&M, but you decide the use that should be made with that.

00:25:02.387 --> 00:25:10.158
If you had the capacity to make a major gift to Texas A&M for any purpose, what purpose would you want that money used for?

00:25:14.383 --> 00:25:20.952
I'd probably opt for an endowed professorship someplace.

00:25:20.972 --> 00:25:21.653
Such as?

00:25:24.502 --> 00:25:27.626
I would actually look for oceanography.

00:25:28.687 --> 00:25:40.241
But a million dollars is sort of useless in supporting students.

00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:50.273
If you invest it, what, you get $40,000 a year maybe?

00:25:53.459 --> 00:25:58.464
That'll support three, four students.

00:25:59.965 --> 00:26:13.599
If you put in an endowed professorship, it would at least give the faculty members some money to do some research.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.244
The university would still have to pay a salary.

00:26:19.264 --> 00:26:22.167
A million dollars.

00:26:23.817 --> 00:26:29.986
It actually doesn't amount to much in the university business when you stop to think about it.

00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:39.199
We got a grant of $10 million, I think, in the graduate college just before I left.

00:26:39.219 --> 00:26:40.862
Kunze was still dean then.

00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:41.883
No, he wasn't.

00:26:43.545 --> 00:26:44.647
I guess I was dean then.

00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:52.398
And I wanted to put it aside and just move off the income.

00:26:52.418 --> 00:26:53.740
But it was spent.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:59.378
Anderson took care of that.

00:26:59.398 --> 00:27:01.761
All right, then my true last question.

00:27:02.462 --> 00:27:06.607
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today?

00:27:10.973 --> 00:27:13.637
I think it's a great school.

00:27:17.101 --> 00:27:20.706
I carry higher regards for Texas A&M

00:27:26.744 --> 00:27:34.331
My undergraduate school is still number one, I guess.

00:27:38.155 --> 00:27:46.143
I really sort of am sorry I'm not in Hagee, to be truthful with you.

00:27:47.444 --> 00:27:53.670
It's a great tradition, and they're fast losing it.

00:27:54.651 --> 00:27:55.452
Let's quit there.
