WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:07.262
Find a job ranch or farm managing that I could afford to take.

00:08.304 --> 00:18.061
So instead, I opted for a job with the Extension Service as the assistant county agent in Palestine, Texas, with W.T.

00:18.081 --> 00:21.447
LaRue, a longtime county agent and a wonderful fellow.

00:22.489 --> 00:27.878
And I got two and a half years of excellent training there.

00:28.955 --> 00:55.047
and I got to know the local veterinarian named Bill Stevens became a close friend of mine and I'd start going on large animal calls out in the country with him and one day in June, hot day, he asked if I'd like to go on a calf delivery with him and I said sure and he came by the county courthouse picked me up and

00:56.191 --> 01:00.055
drove down the street and said, I've got to stop at the hardware store, go in.

01:00.156 --> 01:04.140
He had a brand new car with air conditioning.

01:04.360 --> 01:04.721
Wow.

01:06.002 --> 01:06.603
This was in 1958.

01:06.623 --> 01:10.848
58, no it was in 1959.

01:13.811 --> 01:15.493
And when he got out he said, you want to come in?

01:15.533 --> 01:19.498
I said, no just leave the motor running.

01:19.833 --> 01:26.363
I sat there in that nice cool air conditioning and I just got to thinking right then.

01:26.443 --> 01:29.688
I said, what would it take for me to become a veterinarian?

01:31.350 --> 01:32.632
And when he came back, I asked him.

01:33.974 --> 01:38.341
And he said, well, I don't know, but you can call Dr. McMurray down at A&M and he'll sure tell you.

01:38.361 --> 01:40.444
He's the associate dean for academic program.

01:42.587 --> 01:43.288
Brother, I did.

01:43.308 --> 01:46.313
I called him the next day.

01:47.272 --> 01:51.116
And he said, well, it'll take you at least five more years.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.121
And he told me why.

01:55.161 --> 02:02.930
And the curriculum in veterinary medicine is four, plus I had some prerequisites that I'd have to get.

02:05.033 --> 02:10.459
But he did say, maybe we can pare it down to nine semesters, four and a half years.

02:10.539 --> 02:10.959
I don't know.

02:10.979 --> 02:13.262
We have to come down here and go over here.

02:15.554 --> 02:18.037
coursework before I can tell you.

02:18.438 --> 02:25.748
I went home and told my wife, I said, I've been talking to the vet school about the possibility of going back to school and getting a degree and becoming a veterinarian.

02:25.768 --> 02:26.749
What do you think about that?

02:27.971 --> 02:34.600
And her response was one sentence, no way.

02:36.323 --> 02:36.583
No.

02:38.504 --> 02:47.437
Well, I came down to College Station in Bishop with Dr. McMurray, and he figured that I could get by with four and a half years.

02:49.500 --> 02:54.428
And I went back and told her, instead of five years, it's just four and a half.

02:55.269 --> 02:55.810
No way.

02:56.951 --> 02:57.853
We got three children.

03:00.617 --> 03:04.883
She was working, and I was making $4,600 a year.

03:07.512 --> 03:09.354
Getting by, but that's all, just getting by.

03:10.616 --> 03:15.061
She worked as a receptionist for two physicians in their office.

03:16.422 --> 03:23.030
And lo and behold, in about three days, she came home from work one day and said, I've changed my mind.

03:24.692 --> 03:26.314
I said, why?

03:27.716 --> 03:30.158
She says, the two doctors talked me into it.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.082
Said, that's what you ought to do.

03:34.584 --> 03:35.865
Well, wonderful.

03:37.280 --> 03:49.977
So, man, come January I'm enrolled in A&M, taking these makeup courses, physics, biochemistry.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.058
Was it January of 60?

03:51.359 --> 03:56.085
January of 60.

04:00.812 --> 04:03.936
Man, you talk about tough.

04:03.956 --> 04:04.857
I had to go by

04:06.659 --> 04:14.348
Elementary chemistry book, elementary math book, and start from scratch so that I could pass these courses I'm taking.

04:14.368 --> 04:22.699
They told me that if I made decent grades, I would probably be accepted to vet school.

04:22.719 --> 04:26.263
But you have to apply and you go through the whole process.

04:26.784 --> 04:29.427
Anyway, to make a long story short, I work day and night.

04:30.419 --> 04:34.415
20 hours a day, every day, seven days a week.

04:34.435 --> 04:37.166
I was going to get into vet school and I did.

04:37.247 --> 04:38.753
Now where did y'all live?

04:40.178 --> 04:41.323
We moved to

04:42.198 --> 04:46.263
Park Place, do you know where the corner of Park Place and Wellborn is?

04:47.064 --> 04:54.034
Second house on the south side of the road, a little two by four, $30 a month.

04:56.837 --> 04:58.499
Roach nest.

04:58.519 --> 05:03.126
We finally got rid of all of them.

05:03.146 --> 05:08.813
But they changed the curriculum while I was in school and went to a trimester system.

05:09.788 --> 05:12.111
And I finished in an even four years.

05:12.832 --> 05:13.093
All right.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.274
So you did get admitted.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.340
How did you learn that you had been admitted?

05:18.661 --> 05:19.782
How did you get that word?

05:20.163 --> 05:20.583
By letter.

05:20.844 --> 05:22.326
Oh, by letter.

05:22.346 --> 05:22.466
Okay.

05:22.807 --> 05:25.771
What were your feelings when you opened the letter and saw the contents?

05:27.714 --> 05:31.759
Well, just like when I got my degree, I was on cloud nine.

05:33.882 --> 05:37.027
And had anybody given you a tip in advance?

05:37.047 --> 05:37.888
Had you gotten a hint?

05:38.999 --> 05:41.482
of whether it would be yes or no before you go?

05:41.502 --> 05:42.203
Oh, no.

05:42.323 --> 05:42.844
Not at all.

05:43.765 --> 05:46.088
So you started then in the fall of 60.

05:46.728 --> 05:48.110
Mm-hmm.

05:48.130 --> 05:53.076
How were the, the class then had what, 60?

05:53.817 --> 05:55.459
Sixty, 64 students.

05:56.120 --> 05:56.740
All male.

05:56.961 --> 05:57.481
All male.

05:57.582 --> 05:58.122
All white.

05:59.223 --> 05:59.784
All white.

06:00.725 --> 06:04.890
And were you all brought together for an opening welcome or anything?

06:04.910 --> 06:05.491
Oh, yes.

06:05.511 --> 06:06.272
Describe that.

06:06.860 --> 06:22.359
Dean Price, Al Price, they spent, he spent an hour and a half or more with us and then after he, many others came in and spoke to us, it was an awful lot and a very busy day.

06:22.799 --> 06:34.293
Now I have heard through word of mouth, never heard anybody record it, that one of the things he mentioned in those opening speeches was how to pronounce the word veterinarian.

06:34.573 --> 06:34.974
Oh yes.

06:35.254 --> 06:35.955
Was that part of it?

06:36.205 --> 06:36.806
Oh, yes.

06:37.606 --> 06:44.853
And not only him, but if you didn't pronounce it correctly after that, you got a lecture from several others as well.

06:44.873 --> 06:47.776
Dr. Pappy Burns and on down the line.

06:47.796 --> 06:49.217
There were a lot of good people over there.

06:49.237 --> 06:53.781
Dr. Turk, all of them long since gone.

06:55.002 --> 07:02.149
Describe the beginning in vet school and the curriculum and the routine and so forth.

07:02.169 --> 07:04.491
Well, as you may know, vet school is

07:05.703 --> 07:11.454
essentially eight semesters of about 20 or more hours per semester.

07:14.700 --> 07:19.088
You have to be totally dedicated.

07:20.013 --> 07:21.816
or you don't last very long.

07:22.778 --> 07:25.262
I've always said you don't have to necessarily be smart.

07:25.603 --> 07:32.775
You just have to be hard working and persistent and stay with it and spend all of your time studying.

07:33.416 --> 07:34.899
I set myself some goals.

07:34.979 --> 07:38.665
I said I'm going to not make any C's.

07:38.805 --> 07:45.717
I'm going to make all A's and B's and I want to make a 3.5 GPA.

07:46.085 --> 07:50.138
Actually at that point in time it would have been 2.5.

07:51.620 --> 07:59.790
And I don't necessarily want to be the best in the class, but I want to be in the top group in my class.

08:00.551 --> 08:02.053
And I knew I had to work.

08:02.954 --> 08:07.520
I had three jobs, two of them in the vet school.

08:07.540 --> 08:12.747
Well, one of them in the vet school, one of them in the entomology lab next door on Agronomy Road.

08:13.268 --> 08:17.593
And then my sophomore year, I got the veteran's job.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.221
in the USDA building as janitor.

08:20.361 --> 08:23.946
That was the big job, $1.91 an hour.

08:24.847 --> 08:27.711
My other jobs paid 75 cents an hour.

08:28.391 --> 08:35.701
So your income, the family income at that point was about what?

08:35.721 --> 08:37.644
My wife began working.

08:39.466 --> 08:43.311
She wound up in the 4-H program on campus.

08:45.316 --> 08:56.888
Family income at that point in time probably somewhere between $300 and $350 a month.

08:57.289 --> 09:07.119
Was there anything that first year that was done to get you married students together, those of you that had spouses and children?

09:07.540 --> 09:13.927
Was there any socializing for the students?

09:13.947 --> 09:15.188
Yes.

09:15.286 --> 09:27.122
Mostly in the form of parties where everybody would go and we became a very close-knit group of people to this day.

09:27.242 --> 09:29.706
Who hosted the parties or sponsored them?

09:29.726 --> 09:30.407
Did the vet school?

09:30.887 --> 09:32.590
Vet school principally, yes.

09:34.372 --> 09:39.439
Describe Al Price as a dean, as a person.

09:42.223 --> 09:45.107
Al Price was...

09:49.373 --> 09:50.034
a good man.

09:51.015 --> 09:53.517
I do have some criticisms of him.

09:53.537 --> 10:01.605
He was a good dean, very organized, have to be, to be an administrator.

10:03.487 --> 10:07.250
You know, he's military-like in his precision of doing things.

10:08.892 --> 10:10.033
He's fair.

10:14.617 --> 10:18.621
The one thing that I criticized Dr. Price for, and I did it to his face,

10:19.175 --> 10:22.639
That's the only way I'll tell somebody that I don't like what they had done.

10:27.104 --> 10:35.874
My senior year, I was a class officer, and we called one of our classmates in for cheating.

10:36.515 --> 10:43.663
We began to get suspicious early on that he was cheating and couldn't believe it, and so we

10:45.905 --> 10:50.150
I started documenting it, date times and what he did.

10:50.250 --> 10:59.222
Not just one of us, but nine of us documented, no question about it.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.844
We had a classmate that was cheating.

11:02.506 --> 11:09.955
And we called him into a meeting after school one day and put it to him, and he denied it for a long time.

11:10.407 --> 11:15.595
But after about an hour, he broke down and said, you know, it was obvious that we were right.

11:15.655 --> 11:17.478
And he didn't know why he did it.

11:17.498 --> 11:18.479
He didn't have to do it.

11:18.940 --> 11:19.901
He just did it.

11:20.803 --> 11:21.584
And he's probably right.

11:21.624 --> 11:23.166
He probably is a smart guy.

11:25.971 --> 11:28.434
And we said, we're taking you to Dr. Price.

11:29.075 --> 11:30.678
We don't want you as a classmate.

11:30.718 --> 11:32.761
We don't believe in this kind of behavior.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.744
And we want him to kick you out of school.

11:35.197 --> 11:46.950
And we set up a meeting with Dr. Price the next day and took him in there and sat down at a big table there together and went through all of the details of it and said, I was a spokesman.

11:46.970 --> 11:56.461
I said, Dr. Price, we don't want this kind of behavior in our group and we don't want this fellow in our class.

11:56.721 --> 11:58.663
We hope that you will kick him out of school.

11:59.464 --> 12:01.026
That's our recommendation to you.

12:01.426 --> 12:04.089
He's documented nine times and he has admitted it.

12:04.210 --> 12:04.630
He did it.

12:05.116 --> 12:11.644
And we said, we believe his behavior will be this way forever.

12:13.246 --> 12:16.250
Please get him out of our midst.

12:16.270 --> 12:21.676
And the long story short is that Dr. Price wouldn't do it.

12:21.956 --> 12:22.617
He didn't tell us.

12:22.737 --> 12:23.799
He just never did do it.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.961
And the guy graduated with us.

12:26.322 --> 12:28.204
And I want to tell you one little follow-up on it.

12:30.243 --> 12:33.928
I followed everything he's ever done, or more or less.

12:33.948 --> 12:36.251
I can tell you right where he is today.

12:38.715 --> 12:39.496
He's a nice guy.

12:41.239 --> 12:50.091
Outwardly you think, you know, he's wonderful, but there's something not right about, while Dr. Price was

12:53.092 --> 12:55.297
the head of the biomedical science program.

12:55.658 --> 13:00.410
He was a dean for 15 years and then he went over to biomedical science and stayed like forever.

13:00.430 --> 13:02.235
He was over there until past 70.

13:03.398 --> 13:10.054
And I got my

13:13.325 --> 13:24.759
from the Texas Veterinary Medical Association listing licensed veterinarians in Texas, and it showed the people that were appointed to the Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners.

13:25.399 --> 13:26.961
And guess whose name was on there?

13:27.622 --> 13:28.343
Oh, my, my.

13:28.363 --> 13:30.265
Big as Dallas.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.911
I nearly had a heart attack.

13:36.773 --> 13:37.894
I'm gonna blame you.

13:37.914 --> 13:39.056
I'm gonna blame you.

13:39.076 --> 13:39.256
My, my.

13:39.737 --> 13:42.640
This guy policing our profession?

13:42.957 --> 13:54.994
Anyway, three of us got together and wrote him a letter and said, we expect you to resign your position, period.

13:55.936 --> 13:56.376
And he did.

13:56.396 --> 13:58.019
And he did.

13:59.241 --> 14:02.004
But maybe I was ugly.

14:03.887 --> 14:11.378
I went over one day to Dr. Price's office and I said, Dr. Price, have you

14:13.568 --> 14:20.717
looked at the latest slate of veterinary medical board examiners.

14:21.819 --> 14:22.620
No sir, what do you mean?

14:23.281 --> 14:26.064
And I handed it to him and showed him and pointed.

14:26.205 --> 14:27.286
I said, do you remember him?

14:27.326 --> 14:39.422
And then I began to feel sorry that I had gone in because it really hurt him and he wouldn't even say anything else.

14:39.462 --> 14:43.187
I just walked out and I regretted that I ever did that.

14:43.387 --> 14:46.150
Now, the nickname was Slick Owl.

14:46.170 --> 14:46.430
Slick Owl.

14:46.771 --> 14:52.256
And that did not mean, it meant that he was polished and his hair was well combed.

14:53.718 --> 14:53.818
Yeah.

14:53.838 --> 14:57.001
It didn't mean that he was doing a slick deal.

14:57.021 --> 14:57.261
Oh, no.

14:57.281 --> 14:59.764
No, sir, it was due to just what you described.

14:59.804 --> 15:05.970
He had a bald spot back here and he always kept that hair straight back, not one of them out of place.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.212
All right.

15:07.232 --> 15:12.297
For a beginning veterinary student, do you remember some classes that were particularly memorable?

15:12.833 --> 15:15.556
important, memorable as you're beginning vet school?

15:21.863 --> 15:24.746
Particularly memorable classes in vet school.

15:25.166 --> 15:30.372
And or teachers thereof may not be able to separate the class from the teacher.

15:30.632 --> 15:32.294
Okay, now you got me.

15:32.815 --> 15:33.355
Absolutely.

15:34.597 --> 15:38.501
There's some wonderful people over there and have been historically ever since.

15:39.963 --> 15:42.165
Dr. Francis.

15:43.715 --> 15:45.598
And you know John Milliff, I'm sure.

15:46.299 --> 15:50.386
John Milliff, now there was a role model for you.

15:52.108 --> 15:56.716
A fellow that had a wonderful head on his shoulders, had a great education.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.301
He loved young people.

16:00.722 --> 16:02.425
He loved to teach.

16:03.166 --> 16:08.054
He was an artist par excellence.

16:09.396 --> 16:10.077
And he taught.

16:10.597 --> 16:18.786
with colored crayons in his hand drawing all of this stuff and made it just real as you could not imagine on that blackboard.

16:18.826 --> 16:20.167
He was a wonderful teacher.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.492
Dr. John, everybody loved Dr. John.

16:24.872 --> 16:25.333
Who else?

16:25.893 --> 16:27.735
Oh my goodness, Dr. Turk.

16:28.476 --> 16:30.178
What was his nickname, R.D.

16:30.218 --> 16:30.498
Turk?

16:31.239 --> 16:31.479
Dick.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.061
What was his nickname?

16:33.822 --> 16:34.122
Yeah.

16:34.142 --> 16:38.106
Well everybody called him Dick Turk but we didn't give him any nicknames.

16:41.545 --> 16:43.828
Man, this fellow had a worldwide reputation.

16:45.010 --> 16:51.398
He was parasitologist number one in the world, as far as we were concerned, and did he ever know it and was he a good teacher?

16:51.458 --> 16:52.319
Yes, sir, he was.

16:53.561 --> 17:05.477
With his sidekick, Rural Bell, Rural was a good fellow, but he wasn't a Dr. Turk, but he's a good man.

17:06.098 --> 17:09.623
Both of them long since gone, but Dr. Turk, I'll have to tell a story on him.

17:10.424 --> 17:11.785
That's believable.

17:11.865 --> 17:17.413
Doggone, your old hide, your honorary hide, Dr. Turk.

17:18.073 --> 17:19.055
He's dead and gone.

17:19.095 --> 17:19.796
He's a good man.

17:21.658 --> 17:24.502
He loved to give pop quizzes, and that's wonderful.

17:24.622 --> 17:25.643
I believe in them.

17:25.863 --> 17:27.205
As a teacher, I gave them.

17:28.126 --> 17:34.975
I'll never forget Dr. Kimler, Arden Kimler, came in one day, get a piece of paper up, describe everything you know,

17:35.461 --> 17:49.323
about the... Can't think of the name of the ligament in a cow that holds a cow's head up.

17:50.545 --> 17:51.366
I'll think of it in a minute.

17:52.348 --> 17:59.039
And boy, you talk about catching a class full not knowing.

17:59.059 --> 18:01.823
I think everybody in the class flunked that pop quiz.

18:02.562 --> 18:04.105
Well, the class met three days a week.

18:04.165 --> 18:05.547
It was anatomy, cow anatomy.

18:08.452 --> 18:19.890
The day after tomorrow, when we walked in, he said, everybody get out a sheet of paper and describe everything you know about the... Same quiz.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.293
Same quiz.

18:24.758 --> 18:27.102
The only time anybody ever did that, but...

18:27.605 --> 18:29.407
Thank goodness I was curious enough.

18:29.447 --> 18:37.015
I went home and looked that sucker up and I got it cold, but there was a lot of long faces in there that second time.

18:37.516 --> 18:46.546
But anyway, Dr. Turk gave us a pop quiz one day and then two days later came in and handed out the papers.

18:46.566 --> 18:48.087
He always graded them promptly.

18:48.988 --> 18:55.215
And whenever paper was handed out,

18:56.140 --> 19:15.128
It just seemed like off the cuff, he said, Hall, he didn't know me from Adam, how come you and, and he named another student in my class, papers had similar answers.

19:17.311 --> 19:19.074
And that's all he said, and then he started lecturing.

19:21.638 --> 19:25.303
My Lord, I couldn't take notes during class.

19:26.161 --> 19:29.766
I'd never been so shocked in my life.

19:32.369 --> 19:40.279
And boy, when he said class is dismissed, I jumped up and he jumped up and he was gone and I was on his heels.

19:41.861 --> 19:43.323
Walking down, he wouldn't even stop.

19:44.044 --> 19:46.807
I said, Dr. Turk, stop, I want to talk to you.

19:47.749 --> 19:48.990
I don't need to talk to you.

19:52.094 --> 19:52.675
I said,

19:55.270 --> 19:56.751
You need to listen to this."

19:59.133 --> 20:00.134
And he just kept walking.

20:03.517 --> 20:13.066
Well, anyway, I went immediately and caught this other fellow, and I said, let's sit down here and look at these papers and see what he's talking about.

20:13.086 --> 20:24.636
And it was ten questions on the quiz, and about four of them, our answers were similar, with one question even having one phrase that was just the same.

20:25.780 --> 20:34.189
But the thing about it was we had assigned seats and I sat on the front and he sat over here in the back.

20:34.570 --> 20:40.276
Ah, okay.

20:40.296 --> 20:41.077
Well, did he ever?

20:42.339 --> 20:44.361
I thought that he was never.

20:47.364 --> 20:50.708
My admiration of him was waning terribly.

20:51.295 --> 20:53.439
That was a sophomore parasitology course.

20:53.700 --> 20:59.811
When I was a senior, one day he called me in and he said, you know, I've made you wait long enough.

21:00.493 --> 21:05.082
You've proved to me without a doubt that you don't cheat.

21:05.182 --> 21:06.164
Neither one of you do.

21:06.845 --> 21:08.408
And I made a mistake and I'm sorry.

21:08.428 --> 21:10.031
And I said, that's fine, Dr. Turk.

21:10.772 --> 21:13.658
I said, you sure did wait a long time.

21:14.819 --> 21:16.821
but it didn't tarnish.

21:17.082 --> 21:19.284
So it was not intended to be a joke.

21:19.324 --> 21:20.265
It wasn't any joke.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.907
He was dead serious.

21:23.209 --> 21:30.157
You can lay the papers there and look at them and there are some similarities in about four of the ten questions.

21:30.638 --> 21:32.920
How come you all have the same answers?

21:33.901 --> 21:40.489
You see, the day that I got this teaching award, and then in those days in Guyon Hall,

21:40.672 --> 21:44.576
And you remember in those days, you didn't even know you'd been nominated, let alone that you'd won.

21:44.816 --> 21:45.256
Yes, sir.

21:45.276 --> 21:45.557
I know.

21:46.357 --> 21:46.698
Okay.

21:46.758 --> 21:49.581
He gets won immediately after I do.

21:51.042 --> 21:56.527
And as he comes by, the microphone is turned on as he walks by the live mic.

21:57.048 --> 21:59.950
And Mr. Rudder is getting ready to read the net, you know, and shaking.

22:00.891 --> 22:01.692
Do you know what he said?

22:01.712 --> 22:04.194
No telling.

22:04.214 --> 22:10.020
Well, Earl, you must have been pretty damn hard up to find somebody to give one of these, if you had given one of these to me.

22:10.523 --> 22:14.067
Of course, the audience laughs and laughs and laughs.

22:16.529 --> 22:27.460
As you look back, were there any courses in the first year or so that were really critical to the development of a capable veterinarian?

22:27.901 --> 22:32.425
Were there some courses that were more significant in content than others?

22:34.147 --> 22:39.332
Dr. Monroe, I'm going to say that I looked at every one of them like it was critical.

22:39.548 --> 22:46.036
I didn't see one of the courses that seemed to have any more married or less married than any other, honestly.

22:46.056 --> 22:47.118
But now looking back.

22:47.498 --> 22:52.144
Looking back, the same thing.

22:52.645 --> 23:03.278
The only thing when I look back on my veterinary curriculum that bothered me then and still bothers me today but it has been rectified, they were woefully short

23:04.135 --> 23:08.344
and behind the times in teaching pharmacology when I went through school.

23:08.604 --> 23:12.312
Was that common nationally or was A&M a little on the surface?

23:13.114 --> 23:15.579
I don't think it was universal, no.

23:16.100 --> 23:20.990
I think we were behind the times, especially in the area of antibiotics.

23:21.431 --> 23:24.237
Boy, woefully lacking.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.783
What about go to the positive side?

23:27.044 --> 23:28.786
In the strengths, what were?

23:29.447 --> 23:30.749
Strengths, oh my goodness.

23:31.771 --> 23:33.573
The strengths are across the board.

23:33.593 --> 23:34.615
Okay.

23:34.635 --> 23:37.159
The teachers were outstanding.

23:37.519 --> 23:40.684
The coursework was great.

23:42.426 --> 23:44.509
They taught us really well.

23:44.690 --> 23:48.435
I was very pleased with my veterinary curriculum.

23:48.455 --> 23:51.760
Now you, and when did the trimester begin?

23:52.972 --> 23:57.378
It began in the summer of 1963.

24:00.021 --> 24:08.592
We went all summer long in 63 and that was the beginning of the trimester system which only lasted a short time because that was foolishness.

24:08.612 --> 24:10.013
So you didn't go all four years?

24:10.113 --> 24:10.714
Oh no.

24:10.754 --> 24:12.416
It would have killed me.

24:12.737 --> 24:19.645
Because the trimester ended up being terminated pretty quickly, wasn't it?

24:19.665 --> 24:20.987
Very quickly because

24:22.908 --> 24:24.810
You can just tolerate so much abuse.

24:24.991 --> 24:27.354
My goodness, you got to have a break once in a while.

24:28.094 --> 24:30.578
Which courses were the most time-consuming?

24:31.619 --> 24:32.480
Do you remember any of it?

24:32.880 --> 24:46.097
The anatomy courses were so time-consuming and I've been critical and made polite suggestions to people in the anatomy department.

24:46.600 --> 24:51.848
They teach so much detail that I felt was not necessary.

24:52.308 --> 24:53.630
But still, they teach it.

24:54.031 --> 24:56.755
You know, it's their course and they want to teach it the way they want.

24:56.835 --> 25:01.361
And every little bump and every little crevice and every little knob has got to have two or three names.

25:02.363 --> 25:09.253
And it makes it such a bulky volume of material for you to handle in a short period of time.

25:10.975 --> 25:15.021
And how did you come to decide upon your special area?

25:19.979 --> 25:37.594
When I came back to work as a faculty member in 1967, there were no specialists anywhere in the whole world of veterinary medicine.

25:37.654 --> 25:39.896
Everybody was a generalist.

25:39.916 --> 25:49.665
But with the advancement of knowledge and technology and et cetera, it became imperative that

25:49.831 --> 25:56.958
each person narrow his scope of learning because it's impossible for you to know everything.

25:57.158 --> 26:03.664
So you have to become extremely knowledgeable in a specialty area and let somebody else handle the rest of it.

26:04.225 --> 26:17.678
Well, when they started this at A&M in the 70s, I told them that I was interested in cardiology, study of the heart,

26:18.839 --> 26:28.092
But we had a faculty member that had one year seniority on me from Purdue, and he also was interested in cardiology.

26:28.492 --> 26:33.319
And we were sitting around the table talking about how we were going to do this.

26:33.439 --> 26:43.393
We would be allowed to have a certain amount of time a week to take coursework and to go to meetings and self-train yourself to become a specialist.

26:44.134 --> 26:47.479
And so when he,

26:47.915 --> 26:49.337
opted for cardiology.

26:51.900 --> 26:57.407
There was only one other area of expertise left, and that was the nervous system.

26:57.968 --> 27:00.871
And everybody hated the nervous system.

27:00.891 --> 27:03.094
But being a hard head, I said, I'll take it.

27:04.636 --> 27:08.521
And so that's the way I got into neurology, and I started self-teaching myself.

27:09.262 --> 27:14.068
And that was in the Department of?

27:14.108 --> 27:17.432
At that time,

27:18.273 --> 27:31.397
The clinical sciences were under one department with Dr. Callaham, the head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, with the small animal section and the large animal section.

27:32.179 --> 27:39.893
All right, now you, all right, before you came back as a faculty member, you were a large or small animal?

27:40.278 --> 27:42.481
general practice, all species.

27:43.142 --> 27:45.485
My love was in large animals.

27:45.565 --> 27:48.169
I was raised on the farm and that's where my interest was.

27:49.511 --> 28:02.608
But in three and a half years of practice, along with my football injuries, I was getting banged up pretty bad with wild Brahma cows in East Texas and horses kicking and yanking.

28:03.570 --> 28:06.914
And I said, my career is not going to be very long at the rate I'm going.

28:08.496 --> 28:09.778
And maybe I better

28:10.400 --> 28:11.822
look at small animal medicine.

28:11.842 --> 28:13.765
So when I came back, I applied.

28:14.666 --> 28:28.607
I had been offered a job through the years to come back and I just one day had a bad day and I called Ned Elliott and I said, is that job still open?

28:28.827 --> 28:29.688
He said, yeah.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.070
And I said, when can I go to work?

28:31.551 --> 28:32.813
This was on a Saturday.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.161
He said Monday.

28:34.961 --> 28:37.183
I said, well, you're going to have to give me a week to move, Ned.

28:38.364 --> 28:42.748
And I came back on March of 6, 1967.

28:42.788 --> 28:43.128
All right.

28:43.248 --> 28:47.392
Let's jump back to student days again.

28:48.653 --> 28:55.359
You never, as an undergraduate or as a veterinary student, you never thought about dropping out.

28:56.039 --> 29:02.985
You never questioned whether you were headed in the right direction intellectually.

29:03.556 --> 29:14.327
Of those all your fellow beginning vet students, about how many of those graduated on time or the next year?

29:15.649 --> 29:21.615
Sixty-four of us started in 1960 and 55 of us graduated in 1964.

29:21.675 --> 29:29.583
So eight or nine, did they flunk out or some just drop out?

29:32.146 --> 29:33.107
I don't remember.

29:34.505 --> 29:35.746
any that dropped out.

29:36.447 --> 29:38.109
I'm sure that they all flunked out.

29:38.930 --> 29:40.932
And generalize about them.

29:41.452 --> 29:51.583
Basically, where were they from, country or city, middle class, working class, well-to-do, farms, ranches, what?

29:57.169 --> 30:04.056
I would say that I wouldn't want to characterize them as a group

30:04.778 --> 30:13.212
saying they were the affluent or that they were less responsible or whatever.

30:14.334 --> 30:23.850
In 1960, all of those people were

30:24.522 --> 30:25.764
focused, I think.

30:27.327 --> 30:28.449
At least they thought they were.

30:28.489 --> 30:31.174
Most of them were older, like me.

30:31.254 --> 30:31.855
I was 26.

30:33.058 --> 30:35.883
We had very few real young kids in our class.

30:36.264 --> 30:38.908
Oh, you're saying very few who went straight from undergraduate?

30:38.989 --> 30:39.289
Right.

30:39.329 --> 30:39.870
Very few.

30:40.411 --> 30:40.952
Very few.

30:41.193 --> 30:41.854
I didn't know that.

30:42.295 --> 30:43.477
Yes.

30:46.122 --> 30:47.965
The reasons that they

30:51.067 --> 30:53.850
failed, obviously, or multiple.

30:57.355 --> 31:01.580
There were some that were in over their head and couldn't handle it.

31:02.801 --> 31:15.657
They didn't fit a pattern of background or phenotype or anything else, to my knowledge.

31:17.189 --> 31:18.835
They stumbled.

31:18.855 --> 31:25.056
But now, of those in general, the vet student body, were they country?
