WEBVTT

00:04.199 --> 00:10.265
Yes, his method of making decisions was 
remarkable. And Howard and I always marveled at

00:11.347 --> 00:14.790
how good he was. But once he did that, once he made 
the decision, he didn't interfere with anything

00:14.870 --> 00:25.902
and really needed Howard Vestal. But this took a 
while.

00:32.549 --> 00:47.329
They had to get complete confidence in anybody 
before they did this, and so I didn't realize this

00:32.549 --> 00:47.329
at the time, but they had gotten to know me pretty 
well before they said, go ahead and build anything

00:32.549 --> 00:47.329
you want. Of course, it had to go to them for basic 
approval, but I would dare say, unlike most

00:47.569 --> 00:57.122
universities, Haskell, that When I renovated 
Sabeza, that was, when I say I did, when we did, $5

00:58.013 --> 01:08.889
million worth back at a time when money's worth 
many times what it is today. I don't believe Mr.

01:10.171 --> 01:16.040
Cherry or Howard Vestal ever took a close look at 
the plan. They just signed them off, which I

01:16.060 --> 01:20.046
appreciate. And were you given adequate? 
opportunity to participate in the planning for

01:23.292 --> 01:27.456
the new commons? Yes, oh yes. It's always 
difficult planning facilities, you know that,

01:31.901 --> 01:37.647
because you've been there. But you see what 
happens is a lot of times your engineering type

01:38.367 --> 01:52.962
personnel become so involved they have a tendency 
to overlook the operator. That's what happened to

01:53.414 --> 01:55.437
us. That's one of the things that happened to us 
when the Memorial Student Center, as it exists

01:55.497 --> 02:04.749
today, and the Tower Dining Facility, as it 
exists. Those decisions as to how they were placed

02:04.769 --> 02:12.519
in the building were not made by operators. That 
includes Howard and Mr. Cherry. They were made by

02:15.402 --> 02:21.210
people above that who, in the case of the Tower, saw 
some facilities in Dallas and said, why can't we

02:21.578 --> 02:25.742
have one like this? And it was, of course, there. 
They had a lot of money. They sold alcoholic

02:31.488 --> 02:33.189
beverages. And people were prosperous by 
comparison. And then Memorial Student Center is

02:38.094 --> 02:42.459
so difficult in its operation. It's a very, very 
difficult thing to make it break even

02:42.519 --> 02:49.866
financially. Let's take that point. If we were to 
separate each of the food service operations on

02:51.397 --> 03:06.983
campus and look at it with a microscope, which one 
financially is the most profitable and which is

02:51.397 --> 03:06.983
the least? Well, when I left, always Beza had been 
most profitable. And the least would be big cash

03:14.296 --> 03:21.264
facilities like Memorial Student Center food 
services. And then up at the top of the tower would

03:21.404 --> 03:26.310
even be... Oh, that was, yes, that was a loser. 
That's what I would assume. Interesting story

03:29.734 --> 03:31.255
about that. When it was being built, Howard Vestal 
and I were put on the committee as ad hoc members.

03:39.845 --> 03:47.175
Dr. Holland of the engineers was head of the 
committee, and he said, well, how are we going to

03:39.845 --> 03:47.175
plan this thing? How are we going to operate? There 
was supposed to be a faculty club at that time. So I

03:52.141 --> 03:58.249
said, well, I think you should go out and look to 
find something that's successful and see what

03:52.141 --> 03:58.249
they're doing. So he and his team went out and spent 
considerable time, went to many places in the

03:58.870 --> 04:06.841
United States, came back, and I said, what did you 
find? He said, well, we didn't find anything. in

04:09.477 --> 04:14.024
making profits at one place in North Carolina, but 
he said it was off campus. So they decided they

04:14.986 --> 04:17.129
didn't want it. So Howard had told me I would not 
bother with it. I got it. And so we were unhappy with

04:22.298 --> 04:25.002
the placement. In the middle, it's so difficult. 
If it's to one side, you could have a group big

04:27.967 --> 04:31.873
enough to be possible. So Howard said, well, he'd 
at least try to help out. So he went over and tried to

04:36.698 --> 04:43.028
get a change made to have a garbage chute and 
couldn't even get that. So that's the way it

04:43.068 --> 04:46.413
happened to be mine for quite a while. And of course 
now, it's being well run, I believe, and it may be

04:47.355 --> 04:56.469
making a good profit. I hope it is. But people had 
money to spend now. There was very little money and

05:00.078 --> 05:04.344
many restrictions during that time. As you 
recall, departments couldn't spend any money as a

05:04.404 --> 05:15.840
group for, at one period of time, as I remember, for 
food items. In those almost 20 years that you

05:15.860 --> 05:20.046
served... Well, 22. 22. Oh yeah, that's right. I 
was reversing two numbers.

05:26.292 --> 05:31.519
Did the reporting location for you, did it change? 
Well, yes. After Howard retired, I reported to

05:33.481 --> 05:42.312
Eddie Joe Davis, who was a great guy, a wonderful 
fellow. Then when he moved out, Chuck Hargill took

05:42.332 --> 05:45.656
over his job. And then when he moved, Don Powell 
took over his job. And it was during his tenure that

05:49.761 --> 05:53.266
I retired. Now, with the president's, the 
different presidents, how did their style of

05:55.604 --> 06:03.898
management differ regarding food service? Well, 
I suppose there really wasn't a great deal of

06:04.659 --> 06:20.785
difference, except a lot of them didn't have any 
direct interest in it, because it wasn't

06:04.659 --> 06:20.785
exceptional for President Rudder to drop by. Or to 
bump into him and he'd say, come over and sit down

06:21.507 --> 06:27.815
and let's talk or have a sandwich or something. Or 
to call me on the phone. And the same way with Mr.

06:30.258 --> 06:31.799
Cherry. He might walk in the door. He often did. I'd 
look up and he'd be standing in the door. And I'd

06:37.767 --> 06:40.730
say, well, Mike, can I do anything for you? He'd all 
know. I'd just stop by and see how everything's

06:41.892 --> 06:44.815
going. But that ended pretty well with Cherry and 
the runners. departure

06:51.427 --> 07:16.911
and of course how then finally those one of the 
things that i i never did enjoy was that it got so

06:51.427 --> 07:16.911
busy the vice presidents didn't have time to visit 
with you now uh did the other people that reported

06:51.427 --> 07:16.911
to vestal and cherry and their successors did you 
all have weekly meetings in Well, the element in

07:18.072 --> 07:26.286
Howard Vestal's position, not in mine. Oh, okay. 
They had at one time, I think, and discontinued

07:27.008 --> 07:31.596
that. And Howard had a meeting when needed. He did 
not have it each week. The only reason I had it is

07:37.406 --> 07:40.992
because of their affairs we had to serve. And it cut 
down on a lot of problems. Do you remember any

07:46.941 --> 07:54.350
important decisions relating to food service 
that went all the way up to the president to get

07:46.941 --> 07:54.350
decided? Yes or no?

08:02.079 --> 08:03.481
No, I can't. No, I can't. And you're also then 
inferring that you can't remember when the

08:04.663 --> 08:10.810
president vetoed positively or negatively, some 
recommendation that had come up. No. In fact, I

08:17.001 --> 08:19.924
don't think they ever did a veto or anything. Okay. 
Are there any... Well, as you look back, what were

08:21.325 --> 08:32.316
we doing right in those days in your area? Well, we 
had some good people. And we were

08:39.427 --> 08:46.056
treated everybody the same, even though it wasn't 
very good. And we had some good facilities, good

08:46.096 --> 08:51.403
reputation. And everybody tried hard to do the 
right thing. We had a very dedicated group of

08:56.209 --> 09:06.042
people all over the campus that just wouldn't stop 
for anything to get their job done. Loyalty was

09:07.051 --> 09:14.859
absolutely beyond comprehension compared to 
most places, I think. And in that sense, it was a

09:15.719 --> 09:18.002
good place to be. And what created that loyalty? 
Well, of course, loyalty was more common than it is

09:22.726 --> 09:27.411
now. But I think, for the most part, everybody 
thought the people above them were fair-minded

09:28.452 --> 09:34.678
people. Nobody was making much money. And they 
knew they weren't going to get much when they came

09:38.646 --> 09:42.991
into work. So that wasn't a big hang-up. So a lot of 
them really appreciated the fact they had a job.

09:52.142 --> 09:56.066
Because they had come in when jobs were very 
difficult to find. And if they left, there's ten

09:57.168 --> 10:00.792
people in line for the job. Who were your key 
subordinates? Well, I had Henry Wellens, a

10:04.207 --> 10:20.913
retired Army sergeant, and Harold Therrell, who 
was a retired Army sergeant,

10:04.207 --> 10:20.913
and Mr. Ingram, who was a retired Navy petty 
officer, I believe. And then later on, we began to

10:22.195 --> 10:28.004
have a few more people. I got some very capable 
people, like Clinton Burkhart, a man from up in the

10:32.742 --> 10:44.792
east, Mr. Bierman, Dick Kutches over from the 
Kutcher Club, who was ingenious in serving. He

10:45.173 --> 10:48.716
always said he could touch a plate and make it look 
better. And then we got some good bakery personnel

10:48.736 --> 10:55.221
in from Notre Dame, hired their head baker. And we 
began to get some good people. We got a little

10:58.965 --> 11:01.787
relief on salaries. Howard Vestal tried, but the 
biggest relief we ever got was through Eddie Joe

11:02.020 --> 11:08.286
Davis. He really went to bat for some salaries for 
our people. We weren't competitive

11:13.831 --> 11:21.719
with the commercial world was the problem. We were 
competitive if you talk about other

11:21.739 --> 11:28.125
universities, but that wasn't our competition. 
But we couldn't put on the type of show For public

11:32.294 --> 11:37.020
relations, we needed to by paying policy wages. In 
other words, why would they come? And we had some

11:41.526 --> 11:44.249
outstanding people. R.V. Ray was one. You may 
remember him. You may know him. He's an

11:49.616 --> 11:52.080
outstanding person. One of the top people 
anywhere, I think. Now, these food service

11:55.824 --> 12:00.951
employees normally worked only a 40-hour week? 
No, our managers never worked just a 40-hour week.

12:05.476 --> 12:08.058
No, but I'm talking about the regular workers. 
Regular workers, yes. They started on an

12:09.440 --> 12:11.142
eight-hour shift. They worked a 40-hour week. But 
now they, quite often, they had to work on

12:12.063 --> 12:14.906
weekends. Yes. What days did they get off? Well, it 
was just, you scheduled them. It took, each

12:20.993 --> 12:24.497
manager had to have his schedule and work this out. 
So we had so many capable people this day, pair and

12:24.637 --> 12:28.862
serve. And he did that on a continuous basis. Of 
course, we used a lot of students in this

12:33.731 --> 12:37.379
operation, too. When we can get them, that's tough 
at times. Let's see. I see in my notes, give me some

12:43.313 --> 12:47.442
examples of some good Aggie bulls, some student 
tricks, some goof-offs in the food service

12:47.995 --> 12:54.806
facilities. Well, I'm sure they're more than I 
know about. Randy O'Davis always laughs about the

12:58.171 --> 13:09.409
fact that we used to have a sign up somewhere that 
said, eat on your tray, meant to eat in front of you.

13:09.890 --> 13:14.577
He said, it's cartoon and a student sitting on his 
tray having a meal. We had one joke going, I think,

13:16.430 --> 13:24.699
where I put up a sign that said, take one napkin, 
save a tree. And somebody said that another one

13:24.779 --> 13:30.085
said, well, take one serving, save your life. One

13:31.386 --> 13:45.542
of the things we did that I must tell you about, we 
didn't know we were setting a pace with the whole

13:31.386 --> 13:45.542
United States at the time. In 1965, we started a 
menu board wherein we had students come in, and it

13:46.417 --> 14:01.819
took a long time to develop, actually three or four 
years to its fullest extent, but ask them what they

13:46.417 --> 14:01.819
wanted on the menu. Well, we just didn't think we 
could do it for a while, but we kept inviting them in

14:01.839 --> 14:12.393
and kept working on this, and we would show them the 
menu. We had a five-week cycle. And they would go

14:15.121 --> 14:24.932
down the list and tell us what they thought they 
didn't like or wanted more or less of, and we'd

14:15.121 --> 14:24.932
inject it in there. And then we started adding to 
that all the new items we could get from anywhere.

14:29.677 --> 14:32.120
And there's a lot of them. Every week or two, 
there'll be a new item come up somewhere, and

14:32.981 --> 14:39.508
they'd send samples, and we'd cook it and ask them, 
do you want it served? And this was one of the finest

14:41.058 --> 14:43.820
things we ever did. But you don't change a menu 
quickly. And this took a long time to develop. And

14:52.008 --> 15:04.980
those students become so acquainted with the 
operation, they become supporters and people

14:52.008 --> 15:04.980
that try to help out. And so we had some fine results 
of that. Eliminated some items that that we

15:11.146 --> 15:12.949
shouldn't have, added a lot. And today, I believe 
that's copied in some manner or other in almost

15:13.850 --> 15:24.927
every university and many of the other 
institutions in the whole United States. And to

15:25.447 --> 15:29.914
the best of my knowledge and belief, that was the 
first one of that exact nature that had ever been

15:30.822 --> 15:33.645
developed. The problem might have been others, 
but I could never find any evidence. Do you

15:37.689 --> 15:45.077
remember how they reacted, say, at first to pizza 
or Chinese food or anything like that? Were there

15:45.257 --> 15:48.501
any surprise at that point? Difficulties in 
there? Not much because they had been subjected to

15:52.305 --> 15:59.192
this commercially.

15:59.678 --> 16:01.882
It was always a surprise, though. Advertising has 
so much to do with the students' likes and

16:03.044 --> 16:08.014
dislikes. We couldn't get them to eat hot biscuits 
until they started in fast food places. We had

16:14.366 --> 16:17.512
tried to serve them, and they didn't want 
biscuits. They wanted toast. And now they hardly

16:19.997 --> 16:22.041
eat toast. And one of the amusing things about this 
menu board, and I'd tell them and they'd laugh

16:22.882 --> 16:38.477
about it, you know, we had some, I remember one 
company was advertising spaghetti and meatballs

16:22.882 --> 16:38.477
of all things. So they, this was on a popular show of 
some kind, so every time we'd meet they'd say, we

16:39.438 --> 16:49.227
want some more spaghetti and meatballs. But one of 
the things I learned that I didn't know, and it's

16:49.392 --> 17:01.167
still a surprise today, the same item is not 
popular more than about once a week, and some not

16:49.392 --> 17:01.167
even then. Well, we finally got so many spaghetti 
and meatballs until they quit eating them. So we

17:10.874 --> 17:12.636
started taking them off. So we went from five in the 
cycle back to about one in the cycle again. So from

17:17.802 --> 17:21.666
then on, I'd always say, now, wait a minute. Let's 
don't get too much of this stuff. Another funny

17:24.149 --> 17:27.793
thing is they'd say, I don't like spinach. Take it 
off. I said, well, I'd normally say, we're going to

17:28.975 --> 17:33.960
do what you want to do. But I said, before you vote, 
you ought to know that spinach is pretty

17:33.980 --> 17:40.628
nutritious. good for these different things. And 
I said, probably your mother would want you to eat

17:42.544 --> 17:47.810
some spinach. Yeah, that's right. So I said, but 
we'll vote on it. And I always vote to leave it on.

17:57.040 --> 18:04.849
Compared to other institutions, were there any 
eating favorites here that were different from

17:57.040 --> 18:04.849
other places? Did we eat more or less of something 
than nationally was the norm? I don't think so,

18:09.648 --> 18:15.494
except there are certain items when you go into the 
north that just didn't operate here. There's

18:15.554 --> 18:20.659
sandwiches and certain items or casserole dishes 
they wouldn't eat here. I know I tried to copy one

18:20.859 --> 18:23.642
from Michigan State. That was a beautiful beef 
roll, I thought. It was like a cinnamon roll, but it

18:27.385 --> 18:35.033
had beef rolled up in it, and you cooked this and put 
it, and you had gravy to go with it. And it was so

18:35.435 --> 18:39.338
popular up there and here they wouldn't eat it at 
all. And I had a friend that came down to Sam Houston

18:39.358 --> 18:47.566
from New York and thought he'd inject some 
sandwiches and smoothies we now have. They

18:47.586 --> 18:49.147
wouldn't eat them. And he was shocked to pieces. 
Somewhere I remember in the 70s a group of student

18:51.569 --> 19:05.121
activists who wanted us to privatize the food 
service and called in a local, I mean a a profit

19:05.776 --> 19:12.688
maker, and he started, I remember he said, now you 
tell me how many times a week you want this, this,

19:05.776 --> 19:12.688
this. And then he added on, I think it was 7% or 8%. 
One of the students said, what's that? And he said,

19:17.717 --> 19:18.759
well, that's the profit. We'll serve you whatever 
you want. And the student said, whoa, whoa, whoa,

19:22.906 --> 19:25.851
no, we don't want to do that. Well, that brings up a 
funny point. You know, there's so much of the

19:30.683 --> 19:36.791
community and even the faculty here at the time saw 
no reason why food service should make profit.

19:36.811 --> 19:39.435
Because it was a service. And I wish it worked that 
way, but it doesn't. No, no. They didn't

19:42.799 --> 19:47.886
understand what the... Let's see.

19:51.270 --> 19:52.191
Proud moments. Think back. What are some of the, in 
your years of leadership, what are some of the

19:53.353 --> 19:58.800
things that make you the now the most proud to have 
served those? Oh, I think that you get an award for

20:02.811 --> 20:10.739
some group of students, like the battalion. They 
condemn you one time, but then they award you

20:10.799 --> 20:16.024
another time, you know, for being outstanding. Or 
the President's Association of Former Students

20:16.064 --> 20:21.469
does something. I mean, they're the student 
council.

20:29.240 --> 20:40.554
A lot of times, when you're being criticized for 
something, a lot of students will step up and do

20:29.240 --> 20:40.554
your defense and say, well, I stopped through. And 
we've had that happen a lot of times. And that's

20:46.582 --> 20:50.026
always a good feeling to have. And then beyond 
that, when you get national awards of different

20:50.586 --> 20:55.232
kinds, we've got several of those. So that always 
makes you feel better. feel good, and it's not as

20:57.708 --> 21:06.398
good as having a student compliment, but it's good 
for the school. But those little things come

21:06.418 --> 21:16.089
along, and they're mentioned specifically by 
groups occasionally that you serve. So they don't

21:16.109 --> 21:25.960
come very often, and that was a difficult period 
during the hippie period of the school. And we had

21:26.868 --> 21:31.935
less trouble in many schools, but we had some 
problems. Were there ever any demonstrations

21:31.955 --> 21:37.282
that involved food service or in one of the dining 
halls? Well, there was one. Well, that was what

21:40.426 --> 21:42.849
President Rutter was doing. It had to do with 
everybody had eaten on campus, as I recall, that

21:43.109 --> 21:53.924
was on campus. There wasn't any place else, but he 
decided to be mandatory board, I believe, back

21:57.040 --> 21:59.983
then one time. They marched on his house and this, 
I'd had nothing to do with this. And then he came

22:07.472 --> 22:13.459
along and to compromise he gave a five-day plan 
instead of seven-day plan. We had 21 meals a week,

22:13.479 --> 22:17.444
what we started out with. Now later on, I 
recommended we discontinued the compulsion

22:17.464 --> 22:26.254
board because I told Howard Bestville, we don't 
really have a compulsion board. I said, any

22:30.887 --> 22:36.254
student can go to the right people in the 
university and just get on. I said, it's

22:36.955 --> 22:39.779
harassment to us. Well, maybe I shouldn't have 
done that. I don't know whether I had done it, if I

22:42.622 --> 22:45.426
had to do it or not. But at the time, I was 
exasperated about it. He said, fine. Hard to sell

22:51.597 --> 22:54.100
the market with anything. But he was very kind 
about it when he told you, no, it was not our issue.

23:01.369 --> 23:03.191
He's just the ideal man to work for. He and Mr. 
Cherry both, I enjoyed both of them tremendously.

23:08.538 --> 23:18.270
I think one of the, let's see if you agree with me, I 
think one of our great blessings during the 60s and

23:08.538 --> 23:18.270
70s is that we had continuity of leadership. Yeah, 
oh yes, oh yes. The... It was like handing the baton

23:21.871 --> 23:26.096
to another member of the team. That there was 
continuity when Mr. Rutter came ill and then died,

23:28.038 --> 23:37.248
and Williams, and the people reporting to them 
continued. Yeah, there was no change down at my

23:37.529 --> 23:42.875
level, for example. It just went right along. How 
did the admission of women change food service, if

23:44.577 --> 23:50.123
any? Well, quite a bit, but not immediately, 
because we didn't know what it was going to. And

23:55.417 --> 23:57.079
I'll give you a good example of that. When I 
renovated Sebiza in 76, we still didn't have many

23:57.900 --> 24:01.965
women. We had some, but desserts were popular. It 
seemed everybody was eating two or three. And we

24:07.732 --> 24:11.216
had a large section just for desserts, and many 
desserts. And that's over the, it began to drop.

24:15.381 --> 24:18.144
And hardly anyone was eating a salad. We could put 
out salads. And maybe there wouldn't be 5% of the

24:20.512 --> 24:26.448
boys eat salads. Now that's totally reversed. 
Completely reversed. And of course the girls like

24:31.642 --> 24:34.970
more dainty varieties of things. This is like it is 
in the home. But it took us a while to get geared for

24:37.252 --> 24:39.795
that. One reason was they had so few girls, you 
couldn't gear to that, because that didn't suit

24:40.737 --> 24:46.905
the boys. But the setup like it is is pretty good, 
where you have a good mixture. And I always wanted

24:53.012 --> 24:58.720
to experiment with where I served only women. See, 
I never did get to do that.

25:03.907 --> 25:05.048
Let's see. By the power vested in me by asking this 
question, let's go back and you could change

25:06.023 --> 25:18.027
anything and redo anything during those 20 years 
plus. Is there any change you would make since you

25:18.728 --> 25:23.357
now are blessed with hindsight? Well, I don't 
know. It's pretty hard to say because, well, of

25:26.092 --> 25:40.113
course, I'd like to come in with the ability to make 
my own decisions, to spend my own money and

25:26.092 --> 25:40.113
salaries to hire. Better salaries, okay. That 
would up things a great deal in my opinion. One of

25:46.463 --> 25:52.652
the things I'd have done if I'd had my saying was to 
not go to our own people in our facilities

25:53.290 --> 26:23.010
construction for advice and help by going to the 
outside, the people I knew because I had to pay an

25:53.290 --> 26:23.010
extra person I thought and I knew enough to work 
with those people and some people I'm sure didn't

25:53.290 --> 26:23.010
want to do that but I did and then

25:53.290 --> 26:23.010
I would have built some things a little faster than 
we did But beyond that, I had such good support. It

26:27.757 --> 26:29.759
was just amazing. Right now, the complications of 
the design and location of the kitchen on the

26:29.779 --> 26:35.766
faculty club. Oh, that was a, that, that, that, 
yes, that was, that was one that. Any others? No,

26:42.074 --> 26:49.322
the faculty club and the MSC were the two that was 
really a thorn in our side. The others, the others

26:49.382 --> 26:51.765
were, You see, the buildings were there, and we had 
to build within what we could, and everybody

26:51.914 --> 27:04.751
wanted to do what was the best. It was a question of 
what was the best. That was the tough part. How do

27:08.336 --> 27:13.523
you do this thing with a structure like Sebiza or 
Duncan? And that's the reason I really fumbled

27:14.404 --> 27:20.352
with that thing, and I guess that's the word for it, 
for 10 years on Sebiza. We've made enough plans to

27:20.652 --> 27:25.439
fill half this room, probably, trying to figure 
out what do you do. And of course, they're

27:26.581 --> 27:28.664
renovating again today. It's very, very nice. 
Very nice operation, I think. But the times have

27:32.670 --> 27:35.274
changed a little bit. I think they have less volume 
there. They can do some things that are

27:37.797 --> 27:40.942
attractive.

27:43.546 --> 27:49.174
Any advice you would give to today's A&M leaders 
about food service? Well, to give it good support

27:52.045 --> 28:10.487
would be one thing, and to never get tricked on what 
I think is a trick is to go to this commercializing,

27:52.045 --> 28:10.487
which they call privatization, which is nothing 
more than commercial profitization. And I

28:11.548 --> 28:17.575
realize there are some places and some times when 
if you can't get competent people to help, that

28:17.858 --> 28:27.068
people have to do that, but they do rake off a pretty 
good profit, and if you can avoid that, why do it? As

28:27.248 --> 28:33.275
far as you're aware, about what is that profit 
margin at other universities that have

28:27.248 --> 28:33.275
privatized? Oh, I think it's only, well, maybe, it 
ranges everywhere from two to five percent, but

28:33.295 --> 28:41.965
that's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. Here, 
they'd do it for one percent. I believe that in

28:47.558 --> 28:59.894
order for us to commercially outfit to get the 
hooks in Texas A&M, they wouldn't hesitate to pay a

28:47.558 --> 28:59.894
million dollars just for the right to have one 
contract. Well, and I found being the CEO at two

28:59.914 --> 29:10.107
different campuses, one of the difficulties of 
dealing with the commercial firm is that I

28:59.914 --> 29:10.107
couldn't get their attention until it was time to 
renew the contract. Well, that's one problem they

29:13.721 --> 29:17.465
have with some of the companies. The companies 
vary a good little bit. I have the experience of

29:21.690 --> 29:29.179
working with some of those people after I retired 
here. And I helped them in the sense that I would

29:29.199 --> 29:37.168
help them work out some problems, but I got 
familiar with their personnel. And they have fine

29:37.188 --> 29:38.650
people. I have no complaint about them. ethics and 
morals of their individuals but the company

29:40.782 --> 30:09.523
policy and and necessity to make a good profit is 
there and if you have to cut corners to make that

29:40.782 --> 30:09.523
profit then most of them will cut those corners 
very few would sacrifice the company in order to

29:40.782 --> 30:09.523
save a and m food circuits let's see a while ago you 
mentioning cervix to the board recall if you can

30:09.841 --> 30:37.857
were there any special uh favorite foods of uh 
regents that uh y'all would uh need to keep in mind

30:09.841 --> 30:37.857
when there was a board meeting no not really that 
was a strange thing i had heard of some prior to my

30:09.841 --> 30:37.857
time but we never had a problem as a matter of fact 
they were an easy group to get along with and an easy

30:09.841 --> 30:37.857
group to please One funny incident I had with Mr. 
Weisenbacher, who was very opinionated, of

30:38.663 --> 30:44.432
course. He used to go out and jog or walk, and he'd 
come in early, and he'd go back in the kitchen and

30:45.113 --> 30:51.121
talk to these people. And I told somebody I wasn't 
afraid of Mr. Weisenbacher talking. I was afraid

30:54.787 --> 30:56.830
of my people answering.

30:59.834 --> 31:07.626
But as a result of that, he just became a closer 
friend of the whole operation, including the

30:59.834 --> 31:07.626
individual thing. So we enjoyed it. All right, so 
you don't remember any special desserts that

31:08.735 --> 31:19.090
needed to be made because certain regions liked 
this or that specialty? I don't believe there was a

31:19.110 --> 31:21.073
single one. They seemed to like most of them. We'd 
normally have a pretty good variety, and

31:24.819 --> 31:31.789
sometimes one might ask if we had some.
