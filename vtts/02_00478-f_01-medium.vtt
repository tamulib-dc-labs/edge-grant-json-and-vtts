WEBVTT

00:06.173 --> 00:08.356
Major, and then I'm making Colonel Pearl. Well, 
I've been a colonel until 56, which is about 12

00:08.997 --> 00:12.201
years. Of course, half the time I was out of the 
service. When you come back in, they disregard

00:16.907 --> 00:22.774
everything and just make out like it never 
happened. Of course, to you, that's a long time. It

00:25.198 --> 00:26.359
begins to... It's kind of devil. It affects your 
ego. It kind of affects everything. You have to

00:32.198 --> 00:35.863
start rationalizing and hope that something 
comes of it. But you can't do anything about the

00:35.903 --> 00:39.768
promotion system. And we're doing it on service. 
And your reserve time didn't count as service. So

00:47.739 --> 00:54.389
you just step into a group with a different 
contemporary group. But then after it happens,

00:54.409 --> 00:56.852
well, Everything else, speed it up. Sure. But it 
was a long rest. We've sort of talked around

01:06.363 --> 01:09.347
leadership for a while. Let's turn to leadership 
now. Would you define leadership for me? No. Oh,

01:14.472 --> 01:15.533
come on. Nope. I taught it, and I've learned it, but 
I'll define it. I'll tell you. I don't think any one

01:22.740 --> 01:26.164
person can define leadership. Did you teach it to 
your ROTC? Yeah. What did you teach? Well, I'd say

01:36.044 --> 01:52.742
that I taught

01:36.044 --> 01:52.742
the control and management of individuals to 
achieve an assigned mission.

01:53.060 --> 01:54.421
That's about what it is. I think I have expressed a 
number of different principles and beliefs to it.

02:04.472 --> 02:10.358
Everybody's got to be handled differently if 
you've got the time and the space to do it. You can't

02:10.378 --> 02:19.388
try to handle, in a technological world and 
technological business, 150 to 2,000 people all

02:20.245 --> 02:25.934
the same way because they don't all react the same 
way. They don't all think the same way. They're

02:27.616 --> 02:33.886
skilled at different

02:27.616 --> 02:33.886
abilities and professions. And you may not be able 
to communicate with all of them at one time. And

02:42.439 --> 02:47.907
you've got to realize it. You have to recognize 
people as individuals and as human beings, and

02:50.080 --> 03:02.273
you've got

02:50.080 --> 03:02.273
to treat them that way. And that's the reason I go 
back

03:02.293 --> 03:12.703
and say it's the control and the management of 
individuals to accomplish the mission. And boy,

03:12.724 --> 03:18.990
that's a short statement, but it is broad and it's 
very involved. What type of values do you later

03:20.337 --> 03:22.079
have?

03:42.461 --> 03:43.402
Oh, man. That's like a...

03:48.130 --> 03:57.964
Scott is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, 
kind, obedient, cheerful, good, great, clean,

03:48.130 --> 03:57.964
and reverent. Now we've got 12 of them out of us. I 
think first and foremost, he's got to have enough

04:02.069 --> 04:14.847
self-confidence

04:02.069 --> 04:14.847
to believe that he can do the job that he has been 
given. with the assets that he had been given to do

04:15.367 --> 04:20.813
the job with. Even if he knows that he's short, even 
if he knows he's short in materials or short in

04:20.833 --> 04:38.373
people or short in certain specialties or 
specialists, he still has to have enough

04:20.833 --> 04:38.373
self-confidence that we're going to get the job 
done. He doesn't want to be sent in a hurry by a

04:38.393 --> 04:43.399
subordinate, an old man not with it you can't hack 
it he doesn't believe he can do it he doesn't

04:44.628 --> 05:13.048
believe we can do it and it won't get done along with 
that self-confidence there's got to be enough

04:44.628 --> 05:13.048
honesty that he's honest with himself

04:44.628 --> 05:13.048
and then i've got to qualify he's honest to the 
degree that he can afford to be with his people

04:44.628 --> 05:13.048
because sometimes he may have to have

05:14.564 --> 05:36.055
to hide behind something to

05:14.564 --> 05:36.055
make them believe that they can do something that 
he doesn't really believe they can do. But he's got

05:36.295 --> 05:42.064
to

05:36.295 --> 05:42.064
be respectful. He's got to be respectful of 
himself. He's got to be respectful of his

05:42.845 --> 05:43.987
subordinates. We're talking I'm talking in a 
position

05:44.618 --> 05:57.576
that may differ from a guy that commands a squadron 
of fighters or that commands a wing or something

05:44.618 --> 05:57.576
like that. I'm talking again of leadership or 
management as I have practiced it since 1943 of

05:57.596 --> 06:10.474
being being a staff officer, that I'm responsible 
for only a certain portion of what my boss

06:10.960 --> 06:25.922
is responsible for. He's got a different role to 
play. I know that. In what way do you think it's

06:30.990 --> 06:33.173
different? Well, he's got the whole ball of wax. 
Well, isn't he still a manager? Oh, very

06:39.648 --> 06:41.550
definitely so. Sure. Would you explain the 
difference? Well... So you feel there's

06:45.595 --> 06:47.417
different types of leaders? Well, yeah. See, I'm 
the guy that has to deal with the staff of... What

06:49.260 --> 06:57.269
have I had? The staff of 8 to 120 people. You know? 
Certainly... Get up to 120 people if you try to

07:08.842 --> 07:12.166
communicate with all of them. It's a matter of 
control. You still, when you go through and come

07:14.569 --> 07:30.851
through the office and stop, pass the time of day 
with him, check to see what he's doing, expose

07:14.569 --> 07:30.851
yourself to him to where they know this is the boss 
and this man, this is the greatest thing. The guy

07:31.131 --> 07:33.935
that was here ahead of us never came back here. The 
guy that was here ahead of you never came back here.

07:36.449 --> 07:40.455
This is what I ran into, for instance, at the law 
command. I inherited a deputy that the minute I

07:40.475 --> 07:48.286
said, hey, I want to go back to the sweatshop. You 
don't want to go back there. I said, I want to go back

07:49.348 --> 07:51.832
to the sweatshop. And I want you to see that I go back 
there three times a week.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.723
You never went back there. I ain't the gentleman 
ahead of me. My people are going to know who I am.

08:04.826 --> 08:09.970
They're not going to be afraid to speak to me on the 
street or as I walk through that sweatshop. And

08:09.990 --> 08:12.112
that's back where all the design is going on. Sure. 
The desks are sitting 12 feet apart, you know, and

08:12.533 --> 08:16.996
so on. But the minute that started happening, 
people realized that, hey, this guy cares.

08:25.624 --> 08:27.125
Efficiency improved. We didn't have guys staying 
home sick. You know... was there.

08:36.501 --> 08:52.661
Now, this commander that has got, that we're 
talking about, that's got me doing this, and me

08:36.501 --> 08:52.661
doing this, and me doing that, and then you've got 
these people out here, and each of them have got a

08:36.501 --> 08:52.661
boss. He's got maybe eight, ten of us that are doing 
things for him.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.852
He's got a different thing. He's got a Certainly 
he's got a responsibility to his boss, but his

09:03.625 --> 09:13.618
management of this whole operation, I don't say 
it's any simpler. If it was simpler, he could have

09:13.638 --> 09:23.410
fewer stars than we did, but he doesn't have to deal 
with 120 people or 30 people or 40 people or so. He

09:24.992 --> 09:29.217
has got experts, or we shouldn't be where we are. 
And when he calls us and says, When can you do it, and

09:34.152 --> 09:37.315
when can you have it done, or what do we have to do? 
And we tell him, he's got to rely on us to believe it.

09:40.999 --> 09:53.371
And his

09:40.999 --> 09:53.371
is a little more of

09:40.999 --> 09:53.371
every one of us, believe it or not, are generals. 
And when he sits up there, I don't care whether he's

09:53.971 --> 09:59.136
got two or three stars, and he says, I want it done. 
And we say, it'll be done. But when we say this down

10:04.696 --> 10:12.667
or some civilian and say, I want it done, you may or 
may not get that. Okay, we've already passed this

10:12.807 --> 10:14.470
line. We're now in that general officer's court, 
and when that boss or the general says, I've got to

10:14.530 --> 10:21.139
have it done by so-and-so, can you do it? And you 
say, yes, then you've made a commitment, and

10:21.159 --> 10:24.784
you're going to have it done. But these people 
below you haven't necessarily made that

10:25.585 --> 10:28.710
commitment. You've got to earn that commitment. 
You've got to earn that faith from them. He didn't

10:32.320 --> 10:33.902
have to earn it from me. When I reported in, I 
reported in as a dental officer. And he said, it's

10:39.010 --> 10:42.955
there, you know, whether or not he knew me or not. 
That's right.

10:46.741 --> 10:51.948
Now, I say that it's a different type of management 
in charge. When you're in that, you're back to that

10:51.968 --> 10:59.239
well-disciplined group that the old man says, 
okay, My boss has told me we've got to have it done by

11:00.957 --> 11:03.921
the 28th. You're going to have the materials ready 
for him by when? All right. It looks to me like we've

11:10.130 --> 11:12.794
got it made. Now, y'all have committed to me. It's 
going to be done. But we didn't go around within our

11:18.282 --> 11:25.513
own staff and get a bunch of commitments before we 
came back up and made our commitments to him. Well,

11:25.797 --> 11:29.985
there's different types of leaders in the 
military, it seems like. There's sort of

11:30.005 --> 11:40.065
organizer-manager types, more like Eisenhower, 
and then there's the Patton type, more command

11:30.005 --> 11:40.065
leader or combat leader. Yeah.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.715
Well, sure, there's got to be. And that's back 
to... I think I've said it twice, this will be the

11:47.903 --> 11:56.874
third time, that we've got to have the tacticians 
and we've got to have the research development

11:47.903 --> 11:56.874
type. These are different types of managers all 
together. The tactician, he's got just as hard a

11:59.297 --> 12:11.152
job as this guy over here that's working the books 
and all the science and all the figures that can be

11:59.297 --> 12:11.152
worked to try to come out with something to make 
this guy a job. You know what I mean? Now, when you

12:12.845 --> 12:30.266
were teaching at A&M, and when you had, let's say 
that now as a general, they asked you to come back

12:12.845 --> 12:30.266
and give a talk to an 18-year-old court kid who 
wants to become a leader, and the topic was how to

12:12.845 --> 12:30.266
become a leader, what would you tell him?

12:33.490 --> 12:33.790
Well.

12:36.773 --> 12:43.962
If I was, you know, if I hadn't talked to them and 
they said, hey, how do you come here? Well, if

12:43.982 --> 13:06.730
you're living the core experience and you are 
exposing yourself to the maximum

12:43.982 --> 13:06.730
of situations, attitudes,

12:43.982 --> 13:06.730
then you're going to inherently absorb and put 
into your computer what you need to respond to

13:06.997 --> 13:21.259
whatever is put upon you

13:22.218 --> 13:30.649
Remember I said the last place in the world that I 
call a leader is the guy that's out there marching

13:22.218 --> 13:30.649
close order command. And knowing now that you're 
in fire control. Now when you went through boot

13:33.833 --> 13:45.728
camp,

13:33.833 --> 13:45.728
some of those DIs that probably were under, I know 
that my son was under in the Marines, That's right,

13:46.282 --> 14:00.816
but I don't necessarily call them the type of 
leaders that we're looking for, to take people

13:46.282 --> 14:00.816
into combat, to manage a critical phase of 
operations. I'd have to know more about them than

14:01.917 --> 14:09.584
just their ability to take foot strong.

14:09.604 --> 14:14.989
So my advice to the young man, and I have been back to 
A&M, and talk to a military

14:15.475 --> 14:24.946
engineer. Just keep exposing yourself. Boy, get 
in every situation that you can and learn all that

14:27.469 --> 14:32.775
you can about life. And I'll tell you, this is not 
original with me because I don't know whether you

14:33.095 --> 14:44.048
have heard of this Spencer J. Buchanan that I spoke 
to. I used to go to class, and this was after the war,

14:44.855 --> 14:50.241
when I went back. And Spencer Jay would sit, and 
though some of us were veterans, most of the class

14:50.261 --> 15:01.793
would be cadets, because most of the veterans were 
not going back to study engineering. I don't know

15:02.053 --> 15:02.413
why. I think they went over to some of the other 
schools. But I've been in class when Spencer Jay

15:06.517 --> 15:12.003
just saw a mechanic book and folded it up and said, 
we'll talk about that next time. What we're going

15:12.063 --> 15:13.765
to talk about today life and how to get along.

15:21.284 --> 15:29.691
He's a

15:21.284 --> 15:29.691
retired Corps of Engineers Brigadier General. 
One of the most outstanding men I've ever

15:29.711 --> 15:38.239
known. He helped me in my world for my master's 
degree.

15:46.887 --> 15:53.376
Somebody asked me a question and I didn't know how 
to answer it. It wasn't a technical question at

15:54.498 --> 15:56.360
all. They said, what in the world is an Air Force 
major doing at Texas A&M studying permafrost?

16:14.579 --> 16:23.712
I sat there and I thought, how the hell am I going to 
answer a question like

16:14.579 --> 16:23.712
that? And he waited a few minutes and he said, the 
state of Texas last year incurred a loss of a

16:23.732 --> 16:41.337
million dollars. Cross damage alone for their 
highways.

16:47.360 --> 16:58.522
Permafrost is an allied phenomenon, worse than 
this frost.

16:58.542 --> 17:03.672
It underlays many of the bases and installations 
of our armed forces. This officer has taken the

17:05.845 --> 17:12.314
time to learn something scientifically about it. 
I suggest that we hear his

17:12.334 --> 17:17.121
review. That's it. Now, if we can, I said, well,

17:17.361 --> 17:25.332
from then on, smooth sailing. But how are we going 
to answer a question? What are you doing studying

17:28.256 --> 17:31.160
permafrost at A&M? We don't have permafrost at 
A&M. Certainly don't. Did you know General

17:33.103 --> 17:34.485
Rudder? No, I can't see that. Let's talk a little 
bit about the changes that have happened at A&M

17:39.694 --> 17:50.750
since you were there, especially the changes in 
the 1960s, which fundamentally altered the type

17:39.694 --> 17:50.750
of institution. And I'd like to have your opinions 
on some of them. First, the end of the mandatory

17:53.795 --> 17:55.798
court.

18:09.059 --> 18:16.207
Well, I guess I showed my ignorance when I say I 
don't know what the mandatory court started with.

18:16.227 --> 18:27.921
Because the law, from what I know about it, did not 
make the military mandatory. And therefore, it

18:27.941 --> 18:34.408
must have been made mandatory by either the state 
or the school. But I don't think the law made

18:35.097 --> 18:39.163
military mandatory. Not the federal law. That's 
what I'm talking about, the federal law. But the

18:42.307 --> 18:43.569
school regulations. But the point is that before 
the early 1960s, everybody who went to A&M was

18:43.589 --> 18:53.724
either a veteran or in the Corps. And that was 
changed by by General Rutter, and now, of course,

18:55.246 --> 19:04.276
you know, there's a couple thousand corpsmen and 
there's about 30,000 so-called civilians. And I

19:04.296 --> 19:07.981
was wondering, what's your opinion of that 
change? What is your opinion

19:08.001 --> 19:17.532
of that change? Well, I'm sure that... I think it's

19:19.748 --> 19:45.578
certainly probably

19:19.748 --> 19:45.578
given the opportunity of the college to go into the 
university and the university to continue to

19:19.748 --> 19:45.578
enlarge. Were it mandatory for the student who was 
not a veteran belong to the core, I doubt that the

19:49.853 --> 20:00.884
institution would be of its size and its stature as 
important as that. Do you think that's a good, I

20:01.745 --> 20:16.380
mean, do you think it's a good change that every, 
that the students, that they don't have to be

20:01.745 --> 20:16.380
former, or do

20:01.745 --> 20:16.380
you think it's negative, or? Under the

20:22.102 --> 20:35.155
The attitudes of our society today, I think it's

20:22.102 --> 20:35.155
probably served the betterment of the 
institution. Whether it's served the betterment

20:35.175 --> 20:41.241
of the armed services, I would probably have to say 
no. But the institution, I think, is probably the

20:41.261 --> 20:44.945
betterment of the institution. Another one of the 
major changes, of course, is allowing women at

20:44.965 --> 20:49.189
A&M. What's your opinion of that? Should have been 
there in 1936. I would rather have had one of your

20:55.371 --> 21:01.679
roommates than one of the roommates I met. That's 
the way you felt when it was changed? Well, my first

21:04.984 --> 21:16.940
reaction was, gee, what's going to

21:04.984 --> 21:16.940
happen? But I think it was inevitable. I happen to 
be of a minority group, even in Kiwanis. Whenever

21:29.910 --> 21:45.292
I'm a delegate to a national convention that I have 
been to three of, and it's voted as to whether we

21:29.910 --> 21:45.292
will permit women into Kiwanis, I'm always going 
to vote yes. We never seem to do it. One of these days

21:46.393 --> 21:47.695
we will. Why do you think you vote yes? I beg your 
pardon? Why do you think that you vote yes? I don't

21:53.838 --> 21:54.859
know why I vote yes. Because I think that we've got 
professional women that want to be in our service

21:54.879 --> 22:08.914
organization that are just as capable of doing 
service to their community and to the people in

21:54.879 --> 22:08.914
need in their community as the men are. That 
doesn't say to me that Mrs. Jones' housewife is the

22:08.934 --> 22:17.563
type that ought to be a member of Kiwanis just 
because she's a woman. But if the CPA that has his

22:18.050 --> 22:39.111
office, Pat Booker, is a member of Kiwanis, and 
we've got a female lawyer down the street that

22:18.050 --> 22:39.111
wants to be, and she's a practicing lawyer, and is 
willing to give her time and efforts to service to

22:18.050 --> 22:39.111
the community, I think that that's what we want. 
That's what we need. But how can you get some of

22:42.294 --> 22:44.496
these old diehards Now I turn right around and so 
happens I'm on Master Basin and Shrine. That's

22:50.172 --> 22:54.199
something entirely different. That is an 
organization that is built strictly for men and it

22:54.219 --> 23:03.493
is not necessarily built to serve the community. 
And it's not based on professionalism. It's a

23:06.438 --> 23:08.020
paternal organization.

23:11.105 --> 23:17.136
But what about during, of course, during the time 
that you were in the Air Force, there were a number

23:11.105 --> 23:17.136
of... In the Air Force? When you were in the service 
in the Air Force, there was a great increase in the

23:20.061 --> 23:29.458
number of women into the Air Force, and still is 
today. I was wondering about your opinions of

23:29.478 --> 23:32.303
that. It doesn't bother me in the least, because 
when I was the Director of Personnel in the 80th

23:33.042 --> 23:48.458
General of the 302nd Transport Wing, I had a WAF 
captain in Ferris and a number of WAFs, not WAFs,

23:33.042 --> 23:48.458
WACs, because we were still armed. WAC captains 
and a number of WACs were in my organization doing

23:48.478 --> 23:55.065
just as good a job as the men. Well, what's your 
opinion of drafting women today? Drafting women?

23:59.750 --> 24:02.172
Yeah, this is a new... Boy, you've had to put that 
question in since you started this research.

24:11.490 --> 24:29.514
I don't know, I, Maudie and I, my wife and I have 
talked about this one for a while and I haven't

24:11.490 --> 24:29.514
really reached a position on

24:11.490 --> 24:29.514
that as to whether they should be subjected to the

24:11.490 --> 24:29.514
draft. I think there's a certain state or status 
that can be maintained that permits one to

24:34.687 --> 24:48.582
volunteer but does not necessarily require one at 
that section to mandatorily serve.

24:53.948 --> 25:02.938
One is not necessarily directive or inherent

24:53.948 --> 25:02.938
upon the other. I just, I have not come to a real, I'm 
leaning a little bit towards they ought not be

25:03.745 --> 25:13.958
mandatory.

25:15.018 --> 25:17.742
You haven't quite made up your mind on that. Of 
course, another of the major changes at A&M in the

25:17.762 --> 25:27.237
mid-1960s was, well, by 1968, was allowing blacks 
to enter A&M. And it had been a segregated

25:27.317 --> 25:32.425
institution for almost its first 100 years. And I 
was wondering what you thought about allowing

25:32.445 --> 25:35.650
blacks in. Long

25:35.850 --> 25:41.319
overdue. Long overdue. say and this is not 
qualifying my statement of saying long my feeling

25:44.887 --> 26:08.262
towards black has certainly definitely 
certainly results from long-term service i am

25:44.887 --> 26:08.262
sure that and i uh gone to some other institution, 
served my time during the war, gotten out and

26:08.815 --> 26:33.220
stayed in Texas, maybe even South Texas, that I 
would probably not have the strong feeling that I

26:08.815 --> 26:33.220
have right now. That I think that we We're going to 
do wrong if we don't make it even more open and if we

26:37.992 --> 26:53.576
don't do something to, well, let's push that. If we 
don't open it even more and encourage

26:53.756 --> 27:00.827
more. And I'll even strengthen it by saying, The 
year that I was president of my Kiwanis Club, which

27:05.870 --> 27:16.463
was whatever date that said up there, there 
were... 1977, 1978. Okay, there were four, there

27:17.404 --> 27:22.230
were 14 clubs in our division. And I was the first 
club, first president to ever bring blacks in.

27:29.208 --> 27:32.173
club in this area. There are a lot of clubs in Texas, 
Oklahoma that are predominantly black. There

27:37.683 --> 27:41.349
were very few that had just one or two of them. And I 
brought three blacks into our club during my year.

27:48.561 --> 27:53.089
I brought a retired Chief Master Sergeant who is 
still in our club and is Secretary of our club. I

27:53.440 --> 28:04.113
brought a local postmaster from Universal City, 
and I brought a major active duty Air Force from

27:53.440 --> 28:04.113
Randolph. He was a professional individual who 
wanted to be an Aquarian and had every right

28:04.133 --> 28:12.664
to be an Aquarian. Boy, I was one, and you made me 
one. Was there resistance? Not from my own club,

28:15.007 --> 28:19.512
but from others. Are you sure you all know what 
you're doing here? But they're still there. Was

28:25.088 --> 28:26.189
there hard feelings? No. Just a little 
uneasiness,

28:28.813 --> 28:37.425
you might say. But how do they, are they still 
there? I mean, are relations? Two of them are still

28:40.409 --> 28:43.733
in the club. The postmaster has dropped out, but we 
still have good relations with him. I don't know

28:50.292 --> 29:05.445
whether you're familiar with them, but boy, some 
of those guys, I talked to one over in Galveston

28:50.292 --> 29:05.445
County a couple of weeks ago, and they have a harder 
time than some of the military. They put them on

29:05.465 --> 29:17.175
some of the dirty studies, and a lot of them don't 
make as much as some of the carriers that work for

29:05.465 --> 29:17.175
them. And they work longer hours. Yeah, it's 
crazy.

29:22.743 --> 29:27.648
So you think that it was long overdue to have blacks 
at A&M. I was wondering, you were in the service in

29:28.068 --> 29:33.073
the early 1950s. You were called back during Korea 
when President Truman integrated, desegregated

29:33.093 --> 29:40.361
the armed forces. And of course, the Air Force was 
integrated at this time. And I was wondering about

29:46.247 --> 29:48.309
your opinions of that. Long overdue. Well, we had 
black troops at Mobile when we were forming these

29:52.848 --> 30:01.859
air depot groups. Yeah, back in the war. That's 
right. And all that we could do is either form

30:04.382 --> 30:13.392
quartermaster truck companies and then keep them 
all in that little truck company or platoon. That

30:13.452 --> 30:15.575
wasn't an integrated option. But it just makes the 
whole damn situation organization and

30:21.181 --> 30:23.023
establishment. Just on paper and physically more 
difficult, but then you ask the question, why

30:24.185 --> 30:32.254
should it be to start with?

30:34.918 --> 30:47.813
So you think then that by having qualified women 
and qualified blacks in the service and

30:34.918 --> 30:47.813
integrated positions, co-ed positions, it makes 
the Air Force and the other services more

30:34.918 --> 30:47.813
efficient? than to have segregated units? Is that 
what I'm, is that what you meant to say? I mean.

30:57.117 --> 31:01.303
Well, I would, yeah, let's say as efficient, or it 
does not affect the efficiency. Okay, it does not

31:01.323 --> 31:03.345
affect the efficiency. I don't say that it's an 
improvement. It may or may not be. When

31:08.052 --> 31:19.808
I was chief of the master planning branch, for 
instance, there in Washington,

31:08.052 --> 31:19.808
my number one secretary was his wife. She was 
outstanding. Heather was one of the best damn

31:21.913 --> 31:33.591
secretaries that I've ever met.

31:33.611 --> 31:40.581
Now you said during these two days of 
conversations that You're a very conservative

31:41.000 --> 31:51.335
Republican, yet at the same time, on some social 
issues like women and blacks, you don't seem very

31:41.000 --> 31:51.335
conservative at all.

31:57.343 --> 31:58.705
Or am I putting words in your mouth? No, no. How can 
you call yourself a conservative Republican

32:00.568 --> 32:03.592
then? I mean, doesn't it, do you see a problem 
there? No, I don't.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.295
No, I don't think so. Maybe it's because I put a 
closer association to the socialists and the

32:23.535 --> 32:44.322
liberals and consider them probably closer to 
each other than to

32:23.535 --> 32:44.322
the conservatives. So you're talking more 
economically, then? No, that's right. I don't

32:49.488 --> 32:50.950
believe in a lot of the social programs. And most of 
the social programs, as far as I'm concerned, have

32:55.540 --> 33:09.797
been sponsored and endorsed and kept alive by the 
liberals once they're established. And I don't

33:09.817 --> 33:18.287
know, maybe that's where I kind of draw the 
dividing line to the definition. OK, back to A&M

33:20.832 --> 33:23.054
then. Since the 1930s when you attended to, well, 
the early 50s when you taught there and today, do

33:24.055 --> 33:37.266
you think that it has changed in a positive way or a 
negative way? Do you think it's a better

33:37.286 --> 33:41.009
institution today than it was then? I think

33:41.029 --> 33:49.697
it's definitely a better institution. Well, I 
don't think you have to go back that far. Well,

33:55.784 --> 34:18.109
when I got my master's,

33:55.784 --> 34:18.109
minor in business. Right now, I couldn't even tell 
you what school the business department was in

34:19.135 --> 34:36.722
because

34:19.135 --> 34:36.722
it wasn't a school of its own. You know, it was just 
stuck away somewhere. I bet it, I bet when I was at

34:40.568 --> 34:46.257
the time I was in school as an undergrad, 37 to 41, I 
bet there weren't over

34:47.907 --> 35:03.956
eight different history courses thrown 
together, if that makes sense. And like I said

35:03.976 --> 35:11.890
earlier and somewhere yesterday, it's strong 
points were agricultural and some were

35:03.976 --> 35:11.890
engineering, and yet at that, some of its 
engineering wasn't very highly acceptable. But I

35:20.170 --> 35:26.016
think that they've come a long, long way. And just 
when the different schools are put in rank and

35:26.036 --> 35:42.214
file, either, not within Texas, because I think 
we'll always be A&M or Texas sitting on top, but

35:26.036 --> 35:42.214
across the sound or across the nation, It's a 
national competitive medicine. Oh, I certainly

35:46.490 --> 35:58.930
should not neglect that, veterinary medicine, 
because at one time, there were only two places in

35:46.490 --> 35:58.930
Ohio State that picked it in, if anybody would 
think about that. I'm sure there's more than that

35:58.950 --> 36:06.683
now, but...

36:07.135 --> 36:13.022
Since it has changed definitely from, even this 
thing, the institution has changed from a college

36:07.135 --> 36:13.022
to a university. It's certainly got to improve or 
somebody's just using words and kidding

36:13.042 --> 36:20.652
themselves. My older son would have given 
anything in the world to go to A&M. Boy, he

36:24.516 --> 36:30.924
researched and studied what all was available. He 
just said, there is absolutely no way that I can go

36:31.044 --> 36:34.088
to Texas A&M. and get what I want to know in 
international

36:34.557 --> 36:51.011
relations. It is not there. The faculty is not 
there, and the courses are not there. And you've

36:59.658 --> 37:01.019
got to have both. But times have changed. 
Yesterday I had a wonderful luncheon last Friday

37:01.520 --> 37:04.362
with the head of the MBA, dean of the MBA here in town 
Friday. one of the leading Aggies, had a luncheon

37:04.898 --> 37:16.160
for him out at North Country Club, just so that he 
could become acquainted with a number of his

37:04.898 --> 37:16.160
contemporaries. He had 40 guests, and I think 37 
had on Aggie rings. Two had on Texas rings, and one

37:21.631 --> 37:26.080
had on a West Point ring. Well we've covered a 
number of topics and I was wondering, because

37:26.768 --> 37:36.458
you're the expert on your life, I was wondering if 
I've left anything out that you'd like to put on

37:26.768 --> 37:36.458
tape. Is there anything else that, because I'm out 
of questions. Yeah.

37:58.730 --> 38:03.395
Oh, if it's a format, no.

38:05.338 --> 38:23.038
I think that as we've gone through here, I have, 
other than when we were going to lunch, we've

38:05.338 --> 38:23.038
actually said nothing about some of the military 
honors and things like that that have accrued to

38:05.338 --> 38:23.038
the period. Well, let's talk about those. I think 
we mentioned the the Silver Beaver and the Boy

38:29.071 --> 38:43.946
Scout, which is probably the one outside of the 
military, but from an organization.

38:48.010 --> 38:57.880
The Distinguished Service Medal that was awarded 
at the time of my retirement, that is the highest

38:48.010 --> 38:57.880
award that can be given by any of the military 
services in time of peace. The one next to it is the

38:58.687 --> 39:02.173
Legion of Merit. I managed to pick that thing up, no 
matter what I call it, three times. How did you get

39:08.865 --> 39:11.409
to Distinguished Service? That was the working 
department.

39:17.039 --> 39:24.171
And I am listed in VUVU in America and VUVU in 
Engineering. I know how I got into

39:26.632 --> 39:47.213
engineering, but the

39:26.632 --> 39:47.213
slightest idea is that I got new to the earth. Which 
one of the medals do you value the most? Oh,

39:48.174 --> 39:49.115
certainly the extended service medal. It's the 
highest, and that's where you would, you know. In

39:52.498 --> 39:54.040
fact, a lot of them are caught here, but it's not my 
own country's medal. But I have a lot of fun. If I go

39:56.957 --> 40:04.787
to France, I wear the little boutonniere that 
signifies that he has been awarded the Croix de

39:56.957 --> 40:04.787
Guerre. And of course,

40:04.807 --> 40:14.258
the Frenchman will see it. I've enjoyed the 
retirement, of course. You can call it

40:19.625 --> 40:23.149
retirement, but I'm still waiting really

40:23.990 --> 40:49.524
know what it means, I guess. We have a wonderful 
situation here that the San Antonio area, I don't

40:49.544 --> 40:53.710
know whether any of the others have told you about 
it, but Each year, two different organizations

40:55.900 --> 41:10.095
call all the reserve officers to a full day of 
briefings and socializing. The morning is filled

41:10.115 --> 41:12.378
with briefings. At lunch in the afternoon, it's 
filled with golf. And it's either to Kelly Air

41:16.242 --> 41:21.047
Force Base, which is the logistics command. You 
learn all about, technically, all the aircraft

41:21.187 --> 41:25.772
and all the files and stuff. And the other is Dr. 
Randolph, where you learn all about the personnel

41:26.765 --> 41:42.121
problems and the training of people and so on. And 
they call any of the Air Force officers in the area

41:42.141 --> 41:49.168
into these meetings, and they're pretty well 
attended. There'll be 50 to 60 generals in each one

41:49.188 --> 41:50.650
of them. It certainly helps us keep abreast of 
what's going on. Though most that are in

41:54.085 --> 42:01.957
attendance are no longer eligible for RICO, some 
are. When you

42:01.977 --> 42:09.629
pass the 60 line, you begin to go off. I'm sure they 
can reach out and get you to have a war, but right now

42:09.789 --> 42:17.781
there is no policy for RICO until beyond the age of 
60.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.585
I guess that does it. That's about it. Thank you 
very much, gentlemen. I really appreciate this

42:44.535 --> 42:48.645
opportunity to chat with you.
