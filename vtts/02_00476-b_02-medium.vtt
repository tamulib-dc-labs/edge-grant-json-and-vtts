WEBVTT

00:05.566 --> 00:30.291
Okay, so you didn't— They didn't get to—

00:05.566 --> 00:30.291
Well, we were delayed at Camp Sutton for several 
months after we pulled out of Camp Shelby. We were

00:31.823 --> 00:50.300
delayed at Camp Sutton for several months, and 
then we got from there, we were the first regiment

00:31.823 --> 00:50.300
to go into the famous embarkation camp near 
Rutgers. That's the name for the guy that wrote the

00:51.441 --> 00:53.944
poem.

00:57.026 --> 01:00.970
I think that I shall never see

01:01.810 --> 01:06.374
I shall never write a poem as noble as a tree or 
whatever it is. You know that poem? Is that Forever

01:08.096 --> 01:11.660
England, that one? No, that's this American poet 
that wrote Trees.

01:20.128 --> 01:28.476
I think that I shall never see a poem prettier than a 
tree, a tree that blah blah blah blah blah.

01:31.544 --> 01:32.866
We went up to camp.

01:38.354 --> 01:43.822
It's just outside of Rutgers, New Jersey, on the 
north side. And that was the staging area where you

01:45.624 --> 01:51.333
waited for the ships to come. Now the whole 
movement was delayed by the shortage of shipping.

01:57.582 --> 01:59.104
And another thing that delayed it is that the great 
white father, Roosevelt, had promised his friend

02:00.316 --> 02:21.424
Winston Churchill that America would have an 
expeditionary force coming to the British Isles

02:00.316 --> 02:21.424
without delay. So you went to Britain then? And 
yeah without delay and we will we'll Whip Hitler

02:31.433 --> 02:37.461
first, then we'll gang up and get rid of the other 
war. Well, what the great white father forgot was

02:39.083 --> 02:46.533
that the Japs weren't weak. When they spread out 
down there and wiped out the Asiatic fleet, which

02:46.553 --> 03:01.373
was a very weak sister, the old admiral that 
commanded it

02:46.553 --> 03:01.373
was had the biggest job to cry over after his fleet 
was wiped out than anybody in the service. But when

03:12.619 --> 03:26.500
he was wiped out and the Japs had opened their war 
against anybody that had a colony that they

03:12.619 --> 03:26.500
wanted, all the way from Burma to the best holdings 
of the Dutch and the East Indies included. They

03:33.543 --> 03:50.125
took the whole thing and moved in with massive 
forces and followed up on the victory at Pearl

03:33.543 --> 03:50.125
Harbor. They followed it up and exploited it to the 
nth degree. and that gave

03:56.804 --> 04:16.067
the president a second thought with his admirals 
and his generals breathing pretty hard down his

03:56.804 --> 04:16.067
neck, including his choice general.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.934
I mentioned him a moment ago. Marshal. Marshal. So 
you probably, you didn't get to England until

04:24.525 --> 04:27.408
1943. No, I got to England shortly after Labor Day. 
Of 42. Of 42. And you trained there then for the next

04:35.318 --> 04:43.688
18 months waiting to go, waiting to invade in 
D-Day. We went at first to our first village. We

04:49.134 --> 04:52.258
were in North Ireland.

04:53.453 --> 05:00.661
and we moved in the village that had been occupied 
by the British. Well the British had an army that

05:02.683 --> 05:23.325
was disarmed when they left their guns and 
material on the beaches of Holland following the

05:02.683 --> 05:23.325
retreat

05:02.683 --> 05:23.325
from the... after the collapse of France. They had 
no place to go and they left that there. Well, that

05:27.205 --> 05:53.498
army that was pushed out of there was re-militated 
in North Ireland, resumed training until the

05:27.205 --> 05:53.498
industry of England could re-equip them with arms 
and ammunition to take the place of what they had

05:27.205 --> 05:53.498
left on the beaches at the evacuation from the 
continent. and disastrous

05:54.997 --> 06:03.928
evacuation. Well these people were getting 
pretty well trained and pretty well armed. So you

06:08.974 --> 06:09.915
worked with them? So as they flowed out, this big 
force magnet moved into the billets that the

06:09.995 --> 06:22.590
English had pulled out of, and bear in mind that the 
English was under a threat of invasion in Europe

06:23.397 --> 06:32.070
all summer. So as fast as they could get people with 
guns and equipment down there ready to resist that

06:33.291 --> 06:47.973
impending invasion, which was as bogus as a ten 
dollar counterfeit. But they didn't know it. They

06:49.555 --> 06:50.957
didn't know it. So you trained for the next 18 
months, more than that, in North Ireland and in

06:51.646 --> 07:03.599
England, and you went to, you were in on the 
Normandy invasion. That's right. Now tell me

07:05.201 --> 07:07.023
about the Normandy invasion. When did you go 
ashore? Well let me give you a connecting link

07:08.685 --> 07:10.607
there. We stayed in North Ireland until New Year's 
Eve. of 1943.

07:26.093 --> 07:51.505
And then we moved, our cannon and whatnot were 
moved on by railroad to a town in

07:26.093 --> 07:51.505
England

07:26.093 --> 07:51.505
named You went

07:52.227 --> 08:02.697
to this town Devizes? That's in Wiltshire.

08:08.863 --> 08:12.406
And you were ready to stage the operation across 
the channel? No. Or you were preparing for it?

08:20.763 --> 08:36.761
It was at this time that you became the commander in 
1942 of

08:20.763 --> 08:36.761
the 190th Field Artillery Regiment. That's 
right. Which you commanded throughout the rest of

08:38.623 --> 08:41.025
the war. That's right. Now did you, were you 
promoted to a Brigadier General? No.

08:48.554 --> 08:50.736
You didn't get promoted overseas? Okay. All your 
promotions, if you wanted to be promoted, you

08:52.197 --> 09:06.796
should get a staff job in Washington, D.C.

08:52.197 --> 09:06.796
Tell me about the invasion. Tell me about D-Day. 
Well, no, it's too much between. We were in North

09:14.627 --> 09:19.373
Ireland until New Year's Eve. and then we 
displaced down to Wiltshire

09:21.327 --> 09:50.085
at Devizes and that put us next door to the British 
Army training field and artillery range at

09:21.327 --> 09:50.085
near Salisbury that is mentioned so often in 
Kipling's coins. and so on about the British Army.

09:54.281 --> 10:20.713
So, it's all very plain and we did considerable 
training in firing and in that area and it was a

09:54.281 --> 10:20.713
wonderful experience because

09:54.281 --> 10:20.713
the first thing that happened to a force magnet was 
that when they got one infantry division and one

10:22.533 --> 10:31.983
armored division out of force magnet.

10:36.689 --> 10:50.464
Roosevelt kind of doubled across Winston 
Churchill and didn't tell him that he had reduced

10:36.689 --> 10:50.464
the size of magnet from four or five divisions 
because the Jap victories and seizures from Burma

10:51.541 --> 11:21.025
across the Pacific had forced him to detach the 
32nd Division, which I repeat again was the first

10:51.541 --> 11:21.025
division alerted by General by General Kruger. 
The first division, Kruger's order was to turn out

11:26.090 --> 11:43.469
the four or five most ready divisions he had and to 
get them over his magnet. Then when the tide turned

11:43.489 --> 11:50.877
against the magnet, Roosevelt without telling me 
he was going to do it, just arbitrarily took about

11:51.346 --> 12:04.924
half of the magnet force and diverted it to the 
South Pacific. The first thing I knew that there

12:04.944 --> 12:19.243
was trouble in the magnet force was while I was in 
Alabama

12:04.944 --> 12:19.243
awaiting the move to the port of embarkation. 
While I was there training the 190th

12:20.506 --> 12:30.321
Regiment as a part of the 73rd F.A. Brigade.

12:35.149 --> 12:48.910
While I was there I got a postcard from a professor 
that was a major in the 32nd Division and he was

12:35.149 --> 12:48.910
going overseas by train to San Francisco and I 
didn't know those divisions and then cut off the

12:49.565 --> 13:18.863
magnet force until a postcard came from him mailed 
in Salt Lake City and he was on a troop train headed

12:49.565 --> 13:18.863
for

12:49.565 --> 13:18.863
San Francisco and the South Pacific to join 
MacArthur. So, the 32nd Division stripped of its

13:25.491 --> 13:42.213
down to a triangular division was headed for the 
South Pacific. And of course, he didn't tell me

13:47.767 --> 14:05.953
where they were going in the South City, except 
there was a fellow named Sidney

13:47.767 --> 14:05.953
that had visited our college and made some kind of 
long-winded speech. And he was a graduate of our

14:07.295 --> 14:11.140
college and knew a lot of people. So this ex-prof of 
mine says, says, the Utah address will surprise

14:17.534 --> 14:21.819
you. Says, I have no idea where we're going, but I 
will happily see the

14:23.381 --> 14:39.220
guy that listed us such and such a date. And well, 
here's that guy and date and circumstances. was

14:46.373 --> 14:47.715
obviously Sydney. So he says, I expect to see him 
there.

14:56.008 --> 15:01.837
It was a disguised breach of regulations. In other 
words, he was telling me that they were headed for

15:03.360 --> 15:06.986
Sydney, Australia. So in other words, your force 
was much smaller than than Churchill had hoped,

15:13.913 --> 15:18.360
meaning that you had to stay longer in England for 
it to build up. Churchill was a disappointed man

15:18.520 --> 15:38.691
when he got that news and we continued over there 
training and

15:18.520 --> 15:38.691
so one day a British general, now I teamed up with 
the British, I got along happily with them. I had

15:39.131 --> 15:42.857
read most of their novels I was pretty sharp on the 
governmental methods. I bought two books at

15:49.178 --> 15:54.466
Rutgers. One of them was Geographical History. It 
was an economic geography of the British Isles. It

16:08.769 --> 16:10.752
was by a fellow named He was a professor at London 
University named...

16:20.684 --> 16:23.207
So you got, you had read a lot in New York. Well I 
bought those two books. I bought that book and

16:26.031 --> 16:34.242
another book on England on British government. 
The Duties of the House, The Limitations, and it

16:34.262 --> 16:39.709
was a recent edition. It was strictly a political 
science textbook, but it was recent enough to be

16:40.027 --> 16:54.264
quite helpful. So riding on the ship over there, 
you've got to do something, you've got to read

16:54.284 --> 17:00.912
something. What did you think of the quality of the 
British officer? The quality of the British

17:04.476 --> 17:06.338
officers? They're just like all officers. Some 
are good, some are disasters.

17:15.450 --> 17:20.037
So you must have trained with them while your force 
was increasing in size. Yeah, we went on tours with

17:20.237 --> 17:22.741
them. I mean maneuvers and we took our guns down 
there. I never fired on our guns anywhere on the

17:28.048 --> 17:36.240
British range. that half a dozen of the faculty of 
the gunnery school on Salisbury Plain would be

17:37.402 --> 18:05.746
there, and the British, their mouths were 
watering for those, what they called, long toms,

17:37.402 --> 18:05.746
and they were dying to get issued. In fact, they 
were begging, they said they ought to have at least

18:06.663 --> 18:13.330
eight of these guns for each corps. They thought 
that the British corps was somewhat smaller than

18:14.712 --> 18:22.100
the American corps. But to cover the entire front 
of the entire corps zone of responsibility, they

18:24.442 --> 18:35.995
needed eight of those guns. and every time I fired 
them there'd be a bunch of their officers down, two

18:36.751 --> 18:43.359
or three or four. Now did you have, were you built up 
to size by D-Day? By D-Day, yes. While I was, that's

18:51.149 --> 18:55.274
another story. When we moved out of the,

18:57.696 --> 19:05.526
out of the

19:08.105 --> 19:33.395
embarkation area, when we embarked on the Queen 
Elizabeth to go across North Ireland,

19:08.105 --> 19:33.395
we had every man in a slot for every skill and every, 
he might not have the full skill yet. He hadn't been

19:33.415 --> 19:34.297
with us. But you were a full complement. 
Absolutely. The big worry in that transportation

19:37.585 --> 19:47.234
corps, you were in the hands of the transportation 
corps at that stage of the game. You weren't in

19:48.175 --> 19:56.022
anybody else's hands and you wrote your own ticket 
on what training you could do. And of course I

19:57.804 --> 20:04.690
organized schools

19:57.804 --> 20:04.690
for everybody in the regiment and I kept them busy. 
And it's hard to keep a couple of thousand men busy

20:12.654 --> 20:34.221
when their hardware is already on the seas headed 
to Europe ahead of them and they're there marking

20:12.654 --> 20:34.221
time for enough ships to come in. It's hard to keep 
them busy. Now let's talk about D-Day. Well,

20:39.586 --> 20:47.456
that's a long story by itself.

20:47.476 --> 20:49.639
Did you go in on the second day, D plus one? I was, 
that's another story. How much time you got? Well,

20:57.669 --> 21:02.775
I want to find out about your campaigns. You were in 
a number of campaigns. And of course D-Day is very

21:05.251 --> 21:07.294
important. You were in five campaigns from D-Day 
to Germany.

21:16.930 --> 21:31.613
Well, the

21:16.930 --> 21:31.613
buildup for D-Day was actually more strenuous. 
than perhaps D-Day itself in some respects.

21:38.423 --> 21:59.524
There's a little bit more nervous strain on D-Day 
immediately thereafter, but as far as the hard

21:38.423 --> 21:59.524
work and everything, there was an awful lot of hard 
work done before D-Day and a lot of shuffling

21:38.423 --> 21:59.524
around.

22:04.330 --> 22:06.473
People say, well what were you doing over there? 
What were you doing in the war effort? The 1st

22:13.162 --> 22:17.568
Armored Division was transferred out of North 
Ireland to Africa. The 34th Division

22:19.410 --> 22:30.405
was transferred out of North Ireland to Africa.

22:31.499 --> 22:38.629
How in the hell did you get stranded up there and 
what are you doing now to make the world safe for

22:31.499 --> 22:38.629
democracy? Well, you've got to answer questions 
like that. When there's an active campaign in

22:44.598 --> 22:49.605
Africa, what are you doing at all? A British 
colonel gave me the tip

23:01.553 --> 23:16.049
as

23:01.553 --> 23:16.049
your command gets more publicity in our papers

23:01.553 --> 23:16.049
than our training does. I says, yes, I notice it.

23:20.614 --> 23:22.876
They come down and take our pictures once in a 
while. And I says, what do you think that adds up to?

23:30.545 --> 23:34.410
He says, I don't know, but I thought you might know. 
I says, well, I'll meditate on it a little bit. So,

23:39.437 --> 23:43.463
next time I see him, maybe I'll have an answer. 
Well, I got the answer, but I never told him. What

23:49.411 --> 24:00.366
the British were doing, they were using us for show 
troops to make the Germans think that the fifth,

24:00.548 --> 24:10.403
force magnet was still 100% in the

24:00.548 --> 24:10.403
British Isles. And what they were doing is every 
once in a while when we would be training on a new

24:10.423 --> 24:25.144
different, we fired on every range they had in the 
British Isles south of Scotland. I don't know if

24:25.164 --> 24:30.252
they got any ranges in Scotland, I don't know where 
they were.

24:32.071 --> 24:39.300
We fired on the range there in Salisbury plain. We 
fired repeatedly from the range on down

24:40.362 --> 24:47.511
close to Oakhampton. That's the, where,

24:48.912 --> 25:00.407
that's the, you've read the, That Hound of 
Baskervilles by A great detective writer. We

25:02.079 --> 25:09.288
fired on that range. So you were prepared by D-Day? 
Hell, we were over trained by D-Day. We were, we

25:15.576 --> 25:29.533
fired on the Bodman movers that are famous in all 
the novels of

25:15.576 --> 25:29.533
this gal that writes stories about that part of 
England.

25:41.509 --> 25:59.267
We

25:41.509 --> 25:59.267
were

25:41.509 --> 25:59.267
lucky in that we got plenty of ammunition to fire, 
and what the British were doing

26:02.015 --> 26:17.730
They would take picture of my guns, always with the 
men looking in the direction of the muzzle, and

26:02.015 --> 26:17.730
with their backs to the camera, and it would appear 
in some or three or four British newspapers.

26:18.651 --> 26:28.461
Recently arrived Yanks, trained with British 
Tommies on an undisclosed artillery, So it was

26:29.538 --> 26:32.661
propaganda. Propaganda 100%. In other words, the 
Germans knew that every corps had one of these

26:35.544 --> 26:41.670
regiments. So here we were being stooges. Sure. 
And the Germans in their map of, in their

26:48.557 --> 26:56.946
distribution of the enemy would immediately 
chalk up well Hell, there's another one and

26:57.803 --> 27:00.106
there's another corps. So what we were doing, we 
were a part of the facade of what wasn't happening.

27:16.186 --> 27:19.890
The British were quite good at propaganda.

27:21.793 --> 27:23.475
Now what beach did you land at? On Omaha Bay Beach. 
We

27:27.368 --> 27:57.156
fired, I found a stock of 75 millimeter ammunition 
down there that the British had built up to train

27:27.368 --> 27:57.156
their people to use the French 75s and they took the 
French 75s away from our people being trained

27:57.440 --> 27:59.503
that first year we were on active duty. They 
stripped some of those guns away from us, brought

28:00.385 --> 28:04.332
them over there. One of my officers discovered 
where they were stored. They were stored hub to hub

28:09.340 --> 28:21.861
and hundreds of them that they had pulled together 
and he came back and says, if we still had The old gun

28:22.904 --> 28:28.453
says we could be equipped with new tubes and 
everything. I said, well I think we can get

28:29.655 --> 28:51.088
equipped with new tubes anyway before we go across 
the channel because they aren't going to send a

28:29.655 --> 28:51.088
regiment in combat with 50% worn out tubes and so I 
said, By the way, where's the ammunition that goes

28:51.372 --> 28:55.578
with those guns? They haven't shot it up. He says, I 
can find out. So I says, find out. He found

29:03.811 --> 29:20.215
something like 50,000 rounds in some damn little 
ordnance storeroom over there close to their

29:03.811 --> 29:20.215
artillery range. and I said

29:21.106 --> 29:37.844
make a date with me for me with the supply officer 
down there at Salisbury and we got to talk about

29:21.106 --> 29:37.844
that stuff. I said we aren't getting enough firing 
through our own tubes. I have to keep 2,000 rounds

29:46.473 --> 29:49.476
of ammunition with me. And I says they won't let me 
touch more than just a small percent of that to fire

29:51.247 --> 29:58.813
through the tubes. And their plea is that it wears 
the tubes out too soon. And I says we've got to get a

30:05.619 --> 30:19.952
cure for that because we're not really shooting 
enough stuff to see whether our surveys and our

30:05.619 --> 30:19.952
preparatory patterns of fire are to be done, and we 
can do that with the French 75's if they had them. We

30:31.919 --> 30:42.615
could aim and go through the loading exercise of 
the big gun, then the little gun is sitting here on a

30:31.919 --> 30:42.615
parallel setting and it's got a range of 8,000 to 
11,000 yards depending upon whether you have the

30:43.372 --> 30:55.671
new boat tail projectile or the new powder. It says 
we can get 11,000 yards on that. I says we can go out

31:01.440 --> 31:12.096
there and fire on targets within 11,000 yards with 
these short guns instead of wearing out the tubes

31:12.464 --> 31:24.804
on our long guns and we'll just fire once in a while 
out of the long gun and stay within the limited

31:12.464 --> 31:24.804
ammunition that way. Well on that ticket,

31:25.525 --> 31:40.108
I went down to the artillery school on Salisbury 
Plain and talked to the higher chief there and

31:40.831 --> 31:47.258
asked him what he was going to do with all these 
French 75 rounds. He says, melt them down for

31:48.319 --> 31:54.146
automobiles after the war, I presume. I said, well 
I can melt down quite a few of them if you'll just

31:55.627 --> 32:04.176
lift the lid on them. He says, oh well, what do you 
want with them? I says, I know where I can get 12, I

32:10.835 --> 32:24.007
never fire more than a battalion concentration 
and that would mean 12 tubes.

32:25.829 --> 32:31.494
I'll never fire more than that and I says I can set 
this and I told him what I wanted. In other words I

32:32.475 --> 32:40.082
wanted to do some what you'd call excalibur 
exercises and If you can do a good Excalibur

32:40.822 --> 32:48.792
exercise, you can do a darn sight easier and 
quicker. I'd ram it in and shoot itself, but I could

32:48.812 --> 32:57.043
get on any time I could get on a range. I could go out 
on my own order, didn't have to ask anybody. Say

33:03.051 --> 33:07.116
I'm, except I would report to my headquarters, 
that we were going to fire for so many days on Bodden

33:07.653 --> 33:17.006
and Range, and we'd go out there with all that free 
ammunition. We'd load the things up and then we'd

33:17.828 --> 33:23.996
poop them out with great prodigality. We would 
fire a

33:24.798 --> 33:37.035
widespread sheaf, a closed sheaf, and you 
couldn't lie about whether it was good or bad

33:24.798 --> 33:37.035
because there was the pattern out in front of you. 
You could see it through the BC scope looking at the

33:40.069 --> 33:54.734
impacts area, and so we built up quite a reputation 
among the British as being an ingenious training

33:40.069 --> 33:54.734
group.

33:57.980 --> 34:03.529
They invited me down to the artillery school one 
time to talk to their officers about their faculty

34:04.268 --> 34:08.554
about what they were doing. And they didn't know 
it, but we had a $500 survey instrument for each

34:09.856 --> 34:21.193
battalion. One of the finest transits that these 
ordinary surveyors around here buy. And The

34:34.424 --> 34:39.771
British didn't call it a transit. They called it a 
theodolite.

34:44.137 --> 34:51.246
So, they asked me and my executive officer to come 
down. One of the fellows wanted to make a report on

34:52.468 --> 35:01.680
the way we were doing this thing to his colleagues 
at the artillery school. And he says, now these

35:03.972 --> 35:09.137
Americans do it this way. And while the guns are 
moving into position, the survey squad does this.

35:18.027 --> 35:20.970
The battalion survey squad does that. The 
battalion detail that goes up to the observation

35:21.611 --> 35:33.523
post does that.

35:34.955 --> 35:39.902
So, we were supposed to answer all the questions. 
Now, this fella had walked through a big chute with

35:39.922 --> 35:48.715
us, and he wanted us to be there to explain anything 
he couldn't explain. And when he got through, he

35:50.458 --> 35:53.142
says, are there any questions? And one of the first 
questions he got is says,

35:54.865 --> 36:03.257
says, who takes charge? of him placing the guns 
while all these officers are out there doing this

36:03.777 --> 36:14.809
survey work here, there, and yonder. Who takes 
their place? Who does that? And

36:18.953 --> 36:27.402
the fellow making the speech said, well, I really 
don't know. He says, I hadn't thought of that, but

36:27.422 --> 36:32.367
now that you raise it up, There is something about 
the Yanks are able to do things that we can't do. He

36:42.039 --> 36:49.426
says, we think that it takes an officer to do all 
this survey work. He says, this work in the

36:50.367 --> 36:57.675
American Army is done by sergeants. And you say, 
well sergeant, yeah sure. He says, I want to tell

37:01.253 --> 37:06.021
you something.

37:06.041 --> 37:18.161
The knowledge and skills of the American enlisted 
men are far superior to that of our people. He says,

37:18.181 --> 37:21.807
our leaving home age is 14.

37:24.732 --> 37:27.497
Grammar school, not high school. says our leaving 
school age is 14, their leaving school age is 18.

37:38.456 --> 37:45.743
And where that happens, you can get sergeants that 
can run a survey. And so he says, turned to me and he

37:47.405 --> 37:57.214
says, now you vouch for the fact that all these 
details were done by a sergeant?" I said, yes,

37:58.842 --> 38:02.569
absolutely.

38:02.589 --> 38:05.233
And I says, don't worry about any deficiency. I 
read in the papers that you're going to revise your

38:06.335 --> 38:16.311
entire educational system and put it up to the 16 
and 18 level. And I says, when you do, you'll get

38:16.331 --> 38:20.578
sergeants. How'd you get along with the French 
people? No kidding?

38:28.318 --> 38:29.399
Why do you say that? Once you got into France, how 
were your relations? You just had poor relations

38:31.842 --> 38:35.106
with them in France?

38:39.411 --> 38:50.623
Well,

38:39.411 --> 38:50.623
my second day on D-Day, after D-Day, my second day 
after, well,

38:53.033 --> 39:08.188
I got ashore about 10

38:53.033 --> 39:08.188
a.m. with the tide coming in on D plus one. Now at 
that time the, our

39:08.208 --> 39:22.281
troops were on the beach holding on like a hair by 
the skin of their teeth and the entire Our ship and

39:24.185 --> 39:43.405
the ships around it, patrol boats and whatnot, 
were all under artillery fire, but it was the most

39:24.185 --> 39:43.405
incompetent artillery fire I ever saw the Germans 
do.

39:43.425 --> 39:52.875
They were obviously firing

39:43.425 --> 39:52.875
on area targets.

39:53.834 --> 40:16.425
without adjustment for wind direction, without 
adjustments for

39:53.834 --> 40:16.425
powder temperature, without adjustment for any 
of the refining things that you do before you

39:53.834 --> 40:16.425
really poop out a long range missile. That's what a 
cannonball is, or a projector. How much Army

40:20.412 --> 40:23.456
experience have you had, pretty much? Three 
years. Three years. Which? I was in a Navy gunfire.

40:29.844 --> 40:46.764
Well, you know what I'm talking about when I say 
that you don't just ram the damn

40:29.844 --> 40:46.764
projection through the breach, then throw in the 
charge, back off and poop it out. You adjust. or at

40:49.775 --> 41:07.178
your fire control center, you adjust for winds, 
powder temperature, just every damn little thing

40:49.775 --> 41:07.178
that can affect the flight of that projectile to 
its target. So,

41:07.198 --> 41:15.109
the British did very little of that artillery, 
ground artillery. They believed we'll see the

41:15.129 --> 41:17.993
burst But

41:18.513 --> 41:26.501
why do you dislike the French? Well,

41:26.521 --> 41:40.354
about D plus three we were already ashore and 
shooting. And I had occasion to go back to the beach

41:40.374 --> 41:47.220
to see about the arrival of ammunition, resupply 
of ammunition for our particular guns.

41:57.585 --> 42:12.340
And when I got through that gulch that the Corps 
headquarters were in, I saw a friend of mine named

41:57.585 --> 42:12.340
Ford, who was the intelligence officer for the 5th 
Corps. His name was Ford. I knew Ford quite well,

42:16.816 --> 42:29.712
and I said, Ford,

42:16.816 --> 42:29.712
I just want to ask you one question. He said, what is 
it? Then I'll ask you a few.

42:37.482 --> 42:46.333
I said, how many Frenchmen out of these 
underground Frenchmen French freedom fighters.

42:50.540 --> 42:57.349
How many of them have come in here and reported 
himself as being on our side? And I says the woods

42:58.971 --> 43:12.108
must be full of them around here because this is a 
surprise attack and some of these installations

42:58.971 --> 43:12.108
may have been under

42:58.971 --> 43:12.108
their attack. Has anybody shown up out of the 
underground or anywhere else and said, give me a

43:16.621 --> 43:23.769
gun, I want to get in on the killing of a few Germans. 
And he said, well that's a rather brutal question

43:23.789 --> 43:26.292
to ask. He says, but I can't answer it. He says, yes, 
one of them has come in and reported himself for

43:30.477 --> 43:37.725
duty. I says, where is he? He said, he's right over 
there. He says, we've got him busy, don't worry.

43:45.578 --> 43:49.522
And he says, he's valuable to us, so don't talk too 
damn loud.

43:52.766 --> 43:54.007
He says, there he is. I said, well, which one of 
these undergrounds was he? And he says, I don't

43:58.953 --> 44:00.114
know. I haven't talked to him enough. But he says, I 
do know one thing. He was the spy that we had on the

44:06.581 --> 44:09.544
job. that was reporting the condition of the 
beaches and all that stuff, so he says, he's a

44:10.402 --> 44:20.457
valuable man, don't bother him. And that was the 
first, I had a feeling that out of those basements,

44:28.643 --> 44:41.342
Of course all the civilians, French civilians, 
went into the deepest basement they could find, or

44:28.643 --> 44:41.342
they knew what to do when they knew they were on the 
battlefield. They knew to take to the nearest

44:41.362 --> 44:55.242
forest and

44:41.362 --> 44:55.242
huddle up around any cottage or anything like that 
that would offer any shelter Shell fire, anything

44:55.745 --> 44:57.668
like that? So you thought basically the French 
were chickens. You're damn right. Now, after

45:03.235 --> 45:16.352
D.D., there was the breakthrough, and the 
American armed forces were moving very, very

45:03.235 --> 45:16.352
rapidly all the way into Belgium. And the next 
major event was the Battle of the Bulge, in which,

45:16.372 --> 45:24.823
what was your role in the Battle of the Bulge? We 
were right on the nose of it. We, our guns were

45:30.400 --> 45:35.235
deployed at
