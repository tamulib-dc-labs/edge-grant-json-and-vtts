00:02.562 --> 00:25.785
one two one two one two testing one two one two one 
two friday afternoon uh february the 9th have the

00:02.562 --> 00:25.785
honor and pleasure of interviewing dr john klater 
we're in the evans library to begin with introduce

00:02.562 --> 00:25.785
yourself tell us all about you and your family 
before you came to A&M. Where'd you grow up? What

00:30.884 --> 00:32.165
did mom and dad do? How long did y'all live there? 
Where'd you go to high school and so forth? Well, my

00:35.550 --> 00:37.752
name is John Claytor. I was born in Denver, 
Colorado March 4th of 1951 when dad was a surgical

00:37.873 --> 00:45.482
resident there in Denver. Dad came to West Texas in 
1958 to go into private general surgical

00:49.643 --> 00:51.825
practice. I have three brothers, Mike, class of 
68, myself of number two, Tim's class of 74, and

00:52.726 --> 01:01.336
Dan's class of 78. All four of us were in the core, 
well, two of us were in the core and two were in the

01:01.396 --> 01:06.021
band. And older brother Mike is a Ph.D. electrical 
engineer. I'm a veterinarian. Tim is an

01:12.548 --> 01:19.515
orthopedist in Buffalo, New York, or Rochester, 
New York, and Danny is a dentist down in Montrose,

01:12.548 --> 01:19.515
Colorado. Father was, as I said, was a general 
surgeon. Mother was a Nebraska farm girl, became a

01:22.563 --> 01:26.688
nurse. And we lived in Midland all the way through 
late 50s through the 60s. I came to A&M in the fall of

01:33.115 --> 01:38.021
1968 after graduating from Midland Lee High 
School. All right. So the question of why did you

01:39.924 --> 01:42.447
come to A&M? Very simple. I came to A&M. That's 
where my older brother had gone. Looking back on

01:49.060 --> 01:57.388
it, parents certainly encouraged it because of 
the discipline of the Corps and probably because

01:49.060 --> 01:57.388
it was the cheapest place they could send us, but we 
didn't realize that at the time. When my older

01:58.069 --> 02:03.454
brother had come to A&M in 64, we really didn't know 
what A&M was about. He was an engineering major and

02:03.534 --> 02:15.726
he was accepted at Rice and at Texas, but engineers 
in Midland told my parents that A&M was the best

02:03.534 --> 02:15.726
place to go for engineering because they taught 
practical problem solving, not theory. So Mike

02:16.145 --> 02:17.688
was sent off to A&M. CORE was still compulsory, and 
he didn't know any better, so letters that came

02:18.008 --> 02:24.078
home didn't register much. They said it was tough, 
but that's just the way it is. He lost weight and did

02:26.903 --> 02:28.145
fine. I didn't see him until Thanksgiving, I 
guess, of his freshman year. And took him back, I

02:32.813 --> 02:37.701
guess, on Sunday after Thanksgiving. That's the 
first time I'd seen A&M, and I kind of hard to fall in

02:40.782 --> 03:03.194
love with a place that looked like truly like 
Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary but it was the

02:40.782 --> 03:03.194
neatest thing in the world to me at that time and it 
was about commitment and growing up in the

02:40.782 --> 03:03.194
military and it's what I wanted to do so from that 
moment on I was really ed up with going to A&M being

02:40.782 --> 03:03.194
in the Corps. And you didn't seriously consider 
any other place? No my Grade school teacher,

03:08.508 --> 03:17.782
second and third grade teacher, Mrs. Woodruff in 
Sam Houston Elementary, was married to the

03:08.508 --> 03:17.782
president of the West Texas Princeton Club. And 
they had wanted me to go to Princeton in the worst

03:18.403 --> 03:25.995
way, and I had the grades to get in and their 
support. And I think I broke her heart when I told

03:26.796 --> 03:32.305
her that as a senior in high school that, no, I 
wanted to go to A&M. And no, never really looked at

03:32.842 --> 03:36.388
anywhere else and I certainly didn't want to go to 
Austin.

03:39.192 --> 03:41.737
And you visited the first time that Thanksgiving. 
Did you walk around on the campus much? I did. Of

03:46.544 --> 03:49.149
course it was a different campus than it is today. 
In fact, we even spent the night at the MSC. Came

03:54.217 --> 03:59.085
home Monday but got to walk around as I recall and I 
mean, I'm a high school freshman and a year younger

04:00.719 --> 04:09.695
than the rest of my class, and I've got total 
strangers coming up and saying howdy and asking if

04:00.719 --> 04:09.695
they could help. And I'm not a country kid, but at 
the same time, they were pretty outgoing. It was

04:15.525 --> 04:16.186
pretty neat. And I was very impressed with the 
Corps. A little overtaken, and my brother was a

04:18.711 --> 04:25.663
freshman at the time, so that wasn't a great time to 
be maybe in the Corps of Cadets, but it still

04:18.711 --> 04:25.663
impressed me. When you came to enroll in the fall of 
60. Would have been the fall of 68. 68. Did you go to

04:35.881 --> 04:36.842
fish camp? No, didn't. It was, I don't know if it's 
compulsory now. It wasn't then. I didn't go. I

04:42.007 --> 04:45.890
spent a summer working in the oil field to make 
money for college. How did you get here that fall?

04:49.254 --> 04:49.934
My mother brought me. And dad was busy with 
practice, so he couldn't come. What did you bring?

04:56.035 --> 05:00.821
Knowing a little bit about the Corps and what was 
required, I brought a footlocker, and that was it.

05:01.162 --> 05:09.973
I had my civilian clothes, the uniforms you pick 
up, but everything I had could be packed into a

05:01.162 --> 05:09.973
footlocker, and that's how I went off to college. 
And you drove to where? We drove from Midland,

05:13.738 --> 05:25.333
Texas, straight to College Station, and since we 
knew where the Corps dorms were, we went and

05:13.738 --> 05:25.333
checked in, and they told us what dormitory to go 
to, and mom, kind of interesting, she understood

05:25.837 --> 05:33.086
the drill a whole lot better than I did, and she 
stayed at the car. She didn't have to see her baby

05:33.266 --> 05:40.515
off, but another freshman came out, a guy named 
Carl Alexander from New Orleans, Louisiana. His

05:41.196 --> 05:45.662
dad was vice president of Texaco for the Caribbean 
and South America. We ended up rooming together

05:46.182 --> 05:48.385
for a semester. And that's another story, but this 
fish came out in a t-shirt and blue jeans and said,

05:48.770 --> 05:56.461
hi, I'm Carl Alexander from New Orleans, 
Louisiana. And I'd never heard anybody talk like

05:56.601 --> 06:00.627
that, but he grabbed one end of the footlocker and 
off we went. And mom gave me a squeeze and that was

06:00.687 --> 06:03.912
it. And it didn't dawn on me that I'd just been cast 
to the wolves. your parents or anyone else give you

06:08.885 --> 06:17.698
any kind of final advice as you kind of broke away 
from home that fall? It's an older gentleman that

06:18.339 --> 06:21.543
lives south of Jersey Street. I guess it's George 
Bush Street now. I believe last name was

06:24.247 --> 06:25.949
Callender. They had little, they'd take 
girlfriends in on the weekends and whatnot.

06:30.196 --> 06:33.981
People could stay down there a couple blocks south 
of the school and he told me around that time

06:35.497 --> 06:36.659
period. It wasn't on that trip, but it was perhaps 
right before, maybe a previous visit right before

06:36.679 --> 06:45.190
that, no, I guess it was that same weekend. He said, 
if you ever get your tail in a crack, give me a call.

06:49.195 --> 06:57.947
And it took me a little while to figure out what he 
was talking about, but I never did, but he was a

06:49.195 --> 06:57.947
wonderful old gentleman that had seen 
generations of Aggies come through College

06:49.195 --> 06:57.947
Station. All right, and you had no second thoughts 
at all when mom drove away or anything like that.

07:07.289 --> 07:08.971
You knew that this is where you wanted to go. That's 
what I wanted to do. But I had been, with my older

07:10.533 --> 07:23.012
brother having gone through four years, and I'd 
been in College Station, been to TU football

07:10.533 --> 07:23.012
games, knew some of the guys that were in his 
outfit. I thought I had some idea of how the system

07:23.492 --> 07:27.458
worked. Now, that bubble was burst about two hours 
later when I ran into my first sophomore. Describe

07:33.941 --> 07:35.382
that. He was a sophomore from another outfit. And I 
had just dropped my stuff off and had gone to the

07:39.466 --> 07:46.452
Memorial Student Center and came back around. And 
there was a freshman doing push-ups over right

07:46.473 --> 07:52.178
next to the fence with Kyle Field. And it was just 
that same afternoon. And there were two

07:56.222 --> 07:57.563
sophomores there. And one of them was named 
Emmons, and he was the one that was in charge. The

08:03.571 --> 08:05.794
other one was named Wasaki. And I remember that 
because we used to call him Mr. Wallsocket. But

08:10.641 --> 08:16.368
they had a freshman down doing push-ups for 
whatever sin he'd committed. And since I was a

08:17.169 --> 08:21.195
freshman, I was called in to participate. Wasn't 
in my outfit, didn't have a thing to do with it, but I

08:21.515 --> 08:23.939
was there. So I spent about an hour and a half over 
there until I couldn't do much more. And my other

08:29.302 --> 08:34.557
fish buddy had thrown up on the sidewalk there in 
the sun, and then they let us go. And then I decided

08:34.597 --> 08:39.430
that perhaps there was a little bit more to the 
Corps of Cadets than I realized. And you were in

08:41.013 --> 08:42.755
what outfit? I was in Squadron 6. Did it have a 
nickname? Savage 6. Savage 6. How did, do you know

08:47.442 --> 08:50.386
how you ended up in that outfit? You had two outfits 
that were primarily pre-vet outfits. And I

08:55.072 --> 08:58.958
declared pre-vet medicine as a preliminary 
major. It was made up of ag majors and pre-vet

08:59.699 --> 09:03.484
students. With C1 in the Army side and Squadron 6 on 
the Air Force side. and B1 on the Army side being

09:10.223 --> 09:14.147
pre-vet outfits pretty much. And in what 
dormitory? Dorm 8 was the bottom floor. And you

09:20.715 --> 09:24.339
ended up, how'd you get a roommate that first year? 
Just, he walked in that night, and name was Mark

09:24.639 --> 09:35.131
Taylor from Houston, Texas, and Mark lasted one 
semester at A&M, and that was it. Nice guy. Did he,

09:37.214 --> 09:39.977
yeah.

09:44.142 --> 09:47.246
You were talking about this roommate. Mark 
Taylor, yes. And I don't remember how or why Mark

09:49.970 --> 09:56.900
came to be in the Corps, but there were 56 of us that 
started, yeah, that was the fall of 68. Anyway, 56

09:57.060 --> 10:04.530
of us started in Squadron 6, and I believe eight of 
us graduated four years later. about how many of

10:05.303 --> 10:10.294
those came back in the Corps the second year? We, 
let's see, I think we returned a pretty large

10:11.738 --> 10:15.847
percentage. There were only six sophomores above 
us because the previous year, due to the class, it

10:18.500 --> 10:26.954
would have been the class of 71, their freshman 
year, there was an early football game. It was

10:26.974 --> 10:29.077
going to be on national TV with SMU. And in order to 
get the outfits and the freshmen whipped into

10:29.778 --> 10:35.908
shape, they really worked on them awful hard. And I 
know squadron six was not the only one, but they

10:36.129 --> 10:43.621
lost a tremendous number of freshmen and only had 
six sophomores come back. We returned probably in

10:46.073 --> 10:47.695
excess of 20. Describe how you and that fish old 
lady got acquainted and what was the room like and

10:48.796 --> 10:55.804
so forth. Well, I'd gotten there first and my older 
brother told me that you always wanted the bottom

10:55.824 --> 11:02.132
bunk. Nobody's, you know, you could get in and out 
easier and it was a little darker down there. You

11:08.419 --> 11:11.363
got two desks, you got two closets, you don't have 
anything else. It didn't really make any

11:11.403 --> 11:12.784
difference. So I had my stuff on one side and he came 
in and I he didn't much care so we just you do this do

11:16.516 --> 11:41.629
that okay and he was clueless he didn't know 
anything about the Corps of Cadets he just shown up

11:16.516 --> 11:41.629
and there he was and I didn't know a whole lot more so 
we didn't didn't have a whole lot to share that

11:16.516 --> 11:41.629
first first few weeks he was pre-vet and don't know 
whatever happened to him but he he decided A&M

11:16.516 --> 11:41.629
wasn't for him and he left it mid semester how did 
you get your schedule of courses for that fall did

11:42.385 --> 12:02.807
you go through registration went through 
registration where was it and i don't remember g

11:42.385 --> 12:02.807
raleigh or uh sabisa i think i would think that it 
was not not at sabisa for me uh and it may have been i

11:42.385 --> 12:02.807
believe it was done during a summer orientation. I 
suspect that's when it was. That's not clear. I

12:07.437 --> 12:08.719
don't have a good memory of that. But that's my 
recollection that I was pretty well set in my

12:08.819 --> 12:14.289
coursework when I showed up that fall. I didn't 
have to stand in line to go to registration. Do you

12:16.913 --> 12:20.138
describe what you recall of those first classes? 
The first day of class. Now, you're there in the

12:23.163 --> 12:24.265
Corps. You're learning to drill. You're learning 
to march. We'd learn how to put your uniforms on,

12:27.728 --> 12:32.594
and they're going through things, and you don't 
know. But I remember the first day of class when

12:32.774 --> 12:46.330
this same Carl Alexander, who was not my roommate, 
but the kid from New Orleans, it had a light rain

12:32.774 --> 12:46.330
that morning, and we're leaving for our first day 
of classes, and he heads down the quad with an

12:32.774 --> 12:46.330
umbrella. And you don't do this when you're under 
military cover. But he didn't know because he grew

12:50.395 --> 12:56.082
up in New Orleans High Society, and you never went 
outside without your umbrella. And he made it all

12:56.568 --> 13:01.514
the way to the end of the quad before somebody 
realized this isn't right. There wasn't

13:01.534 --> 13:06.780
something they couldn't put their finger on it, 
but they, it was, it was wild, uh, classes. I had,

13:08.122 --> 13:16.972
uh, an honors algebra class, had a lady professor 
was quite good and thorough and no problems. Uh,

13:17.352 --> 13:18.474
freshman chemistry. I can remember sitting. in 
freshman chemistry late that Monday morning and

13:20.193 --> 13:27.823
the professor saying, look to your left and look to 
your right. You've heard it before, but I'll tell

13:27.923 --> 13:35.273
you that only one third of you will be here next 
semester for the second half of this course. And we

13:36.455 --> 13:39.699
all kind of chuckled and that's exactly what it 
was.

13:43.564 --> 13:45.627
I can remember trying to get to class and having to 
whip out and meet upperclassmen and sometimes not

13:46.568 --> 13:56.166
being able to get to class because you'd hike off to 
the architecture building or to the MSC and you had

13:46.568 --> 13:56.166
a class in another building. You couldn't leave 
that upperclassman or get away from him, so I

13:57.108 --> 14:00.635
remember that. Any other classes you remember 
that fall or spring, that freshman year? Well,

14:05.845 --> 14:08.931
Honors American History. There was a Dr. Haskell 
Monroe. And I can honestly say that it was

14:11.820 --> 14:20.308
probably, in many ways, the most challenging 
class. Not necessarily the hardest, but it was the

14:20.368 --> 14:28.936
most challenging class I had because Dr. Monroe 
would frequently give me a hard time about being in

14:20.368 --> 14:28.936
the Corps. Why don't you get out? Why are you 
staying in? I was in the Honors Colloquia. It was a

14:33.540 --> 14:35.442
smaller American history class. It's also the 
first class that somebody said, get a blue book and

14:35.928 --> 14:41.035
write down everything you know. I don't care about 
your spelling or your handwriting or your

14:41.075 --> 14:48.405
punctuation or your grammar, but write down 
everything you know about this subject or that

14:41.075 --> 14:48.405
subject. And he'd only give us a test with two or 
three subjects. So these are things that some 30

14:50.468 --> 14:58.118
years later you remember, 32 years later, you 
remember well. And these are things that prepare

14:58.579 --> 15:01.142
you when You're sitting in a boardroom at the Royal 
Veterinary College in London, England, and

15:01.831 --> 15:10.666
somebody wants you to tell what you have just seen 
of their college, and don't pull any punches. And

15:11.107 --> 15:13.491
it was easy to do, and the first thing I thought was 
my blue book. In that class were a group of

15:14.633 --> 15:23.688
sophomores and some freshmen, some that went on 
with me, maybe one or two to vet school, others to

15:14.633 --> 15:23.688
other professions. One, Dr. I believe it was Andy 
Anderson, who you probably remember. Was a

15:30.909 --> 15:33.796
sophomore at that time and has gone on to great 
things. I believe he's a thoracic surgeon. And a

15:36.462 --> 15:38.346
few others that have done things. So it was an 
interesting group. And what I hope was

15:41.073 --> 15:46.806
understandable when I was challenging people 
like you on the Corps is are you doing what you want

15:47.528 --> 15:49.230
to do? Have you thought it through? If you haven't, 
do. You've got a choice, make it. That's right. And

15:55.077 --> 15:57.880
it was an interesting, let's qualify that for the 
record. This is the fall of 68. It's the height of

15:59.682 --> 16:01.424
the Vietnam War. In many ways, we felt like it was us 
against the rest of the world. Right or wrong, we

16:06.810 --> 16:09.874
were in the military, and that's the way we felt. 
During those first months, did you ever think

16:10.414 --> 16:15.460
about dropping out, going somewhere else? I never 
did. I had a girlfriend at Baylor, and you know, you

16:17.222 --> 16:24.531
miss seeing your girlfriend, but no other school 
held it for me. I did find it harder than I expected.

16:27.214 --> 16:28.716
It didn't kill me, but it was harder. I lost a little 
weight. I remember what it was like those first

16:30.618 --> 16:34.123
three weeks of waking up with a knot in my stomach. 
Never had that experience in my life. It was okay

16:38.348 --> 16:42.493
though, but I really didn't know this was it. 
Nobody in Midland, Texas wanted to hear that I

16:43.047 --> 16:47.371
wanted to come home, so it was sink or swim. And how 
often that fall did you communicate with family?

16:52.196 --> 16:53.777
Letters or phone calls? Probably weekly letters. 
Long distance. Phones cost money back then, so we

16:58.082 --> 17:04.027
didn't call much, but frequent letters back and 
forth. My dad wasn't a letter writer. Every once in

17:05.869 --> 17:11.014
a while he'd jot a little something down, but nice 
letters from home, care packages. You remember

17:11.054 --> 17:12.936
those, especially as a freshman. when, you know, 
we called it kush, but when cookies or popcorn or

17:13.642 --> 17:25.797
something came, or maybe cookies with popcorn 
packed around them, and it didn't take long, and

17:13.642 --> 17:25.797
you could figure out whose mothers were good at 
sending stuff and if it was going to be edible. I had

17:25.817 --> 17:31.664
one guy that had a very wonderful, dutiful 
girlfriend that was the worst cook in the world.

17:31.724 --> 17:34.768
And so, you know, that stuff we let the 
upperclassmen feast on. You went to the dining

17:37.111 --> 17:38.893
hall, to Duncan. What was the routine in your 
outfit in the dining hall? Well, of course, we ate

17:43.595 --> 17:45.477
family style. We blocked in. We had our area to sit 
in, and we had assigned seats. We would have either

17:49.160 --> 18:02.713
juniors or seniors on the row, the non-walking 
aisle where the support pillars were, then a

17:49.160 --> 18:02.713
freshman that would give meal service to them, 
then a sophomore, and then freshman again. And the

18:02.873 --> 18:04.675
freshman on the end would run hot corner. You would 
alternate between giving meal service to a white

18:10.038 --> 18:33.227
belt or being on hot corner and that would change 
probably oh on a every other week basis uh... that

18:10.038 --> 18:33.227
sort of thing the uh... kids that ran hot corner 
would take the order from the waiters that came and

18:10.038 --> 18:33.227
the other freshmen were strictly to feed the and 
take care of the upperclassmen which uh... our

18:10.038 --> 18:33.227
commanding officer was from wall texas a big tall 
German guy named George Schriever and George was

18:33.427 --> 19:01.695
about six foot six almost too tall to get an Air 
Force contract but just just barely made it big

18:33.427 --> 19:01.695
ugly scar-faced cotton farmer from Wall Texas and 
one of my fondest recollections about meal

18:33.427 --> 19:01.695
service was when it was raining it was early spring 
of my freshman year and somebody had stolen a fetal

18:33.427 --> 19:01.695
pig from the biology lab and Keith Schwartz was the 
only Jewish kid we had in the outfit. He only lasted

19:07.267 --> 19:16.823
two semesters, but he contrived to hang this fetal 
pig between his legs and made it all the way to chow

19:07.267 --> 19:16.823
underneath his raincoat. Nobody could see it. 
Even with formaldehyde, they didn't smell it. We

19:20.089 --> 19:23.194
got it all the way in, and then they snuck it under 
the table. to me and I placed it on our commanding

19:23.765 --> 19:29.342
officer's plate and cut it up and stuck a fork in it. 
And needless to say, he didn't pay any attention to

19:30.426 --> 19:36.103
what he was eating until he nearly got it in his 
mouth. And we paid a very heavy price for that, but

19:36.522 --> 19:39.826
it was worth it. Now that's a superb Good Bull 
story. The fetal pig that went to chow. Were there

19:47.497 --> 19:49.960
cush questions at your table? Every night. Sample 
some of them for us. You know, I'll tell you one. We

19:54.806 --> 19:56.409
had to make up Aggie jokes. We went through a period 
that we had to have a new Aggie joke or we couldn't

19:56.429 --> 20:00.454
eat. We had guys getting old Polish joke books, 
bohunk joke books, whatever it took, joke books

20:01.615 --> 20:11.047
from relatives, anything they could find. And the 
upperclassmen, we went through about a six-week

20:12.029 --> 20:17.436
period, didn't have a new Aggie joke. We got turned 
away at the door. We marched a child. We turned

20:20.139 --> 20:21.060
away. So that didn't take long, and we became very, 
very good at reciting Aggie jokes. A Cush question

20:27.518 --> 20:33.225
that I got the other day, an example. How many stars 
are there in the Texas flag?

20:40.875 --> 20:41.155
I don't know. Sure you do. In the Texas flag? Not the 
American flag, just the Texas flag. Oh, what? No,

20:45.981 --> 20:46.982
there's two. There's one on each side. That's 
right. And if you had said two, he'd said, no, it's

20:51.108 --> 20:53.030
one. It goes all the way through. You can't win on a 
cush question. See, there's no answer to a cush

20:55.513 --> 20:56.694
question. And the reason they have a cush question 
is because the upperclassman that asks, you're

20:56.734 --> 21:00.939
betting on the food. And if it's something that he 
wants, okay, it's a double or nothing deal. If you

21:04.603 --> 21:05.705
get it right, it's yours. If you lose, it's mine. So 
that they ask a question for which they know

21:07.186 --> 21:13.514
whatever answer you give, they're not going to 
accept it. Now, I'll take cush questions to

21:13.534 --> 21:15.476
another level. Had one upperclassman named Bill 
Hall, he was our first sergeant, and Bill did not

21:18.734 --> 21:23.482
like cobbler. Didn't like the crumbly cob, it was 
great, but he didn't like it. And if we ever ate a

21:27.849 --> 21:44.455
meal that his roommate wasn't there, Rick 
Fitzhugh, Bill would ask, because he loved to get

21:27.849 --> 21:44.455
one step ahead of the sophomores before the cush 
questions, and he would say, Fish Jones, which

21:44.840 --> 22:10.307
piece is yours and if you ever asked a freshman 
which piece was his he was to take his fist and bury

21:44.840 --> 22:10.307
it in the middle of the cobbler pot just like this 
one sir and cawap and the stuff flew all over the

21:44.840 --> 22:10.307
table hit the sophomores hit the freshmen but they 
couldn't do anything because that was legal so

21:44.840 --> 22:10.307
they didn't get their cush and they got a dirty 
uniform instead now the freshmen usually paid for

21:44.840 --> 22:10.307
it later on but That was a good bull. Lots of 
campusology, lots of questions. All the

22:17.139 --> 22:28.952
nicknames of the food, did you ever get into 
trouble with any of the food nicknames or the chow

22:17.139 --> 22:28.952
hall slang back home that you forgot what you were 
about to say? Well, mayonnaise was called cum, you

22:29.392 --> 22:35.819
know, like an ejaculate. And I sat there at home and 
I said, shoot the cum, please. And my little

22:41.675 --> 22:46.522
brother looked at me and just, what are you talking 
about? Mustard

22:46.562 --> 22:50.968
was baby, that was fine. Blood, bull neck. It was 
worse at my girlfriend's house because they had no

22:54.493 --> 23:00.561
clue.

23:02.735 --> 23:32.168
her mother got a little upset that I referred to 
steak one night as bull neck not meaning to but she

23:02.735 --> 23:32.168
mistakenly thought that I was liking that to the 
quality of her cooking and she was from

23:02.735 --> 23:32.168
Mississippi and she took umbrage with that but 
anyway that's another story student nicknames

23:02.735 --> 23:32.168
were there some good nicknames in your outfit oh 
there were just like any others we had a guy named

23:02.735 --> 23:32.168
Frank Strother from Jasper and Frank was probably 
one of the uglier individuals that God created,

23:32.502 --> 23:36.291
and so we call him the sloth. He looked like a sloth.

23:40.682 --> 23:41.304
Let's see. Glenn Honaker from... Fort Stockton 
with his short haircut, had white sidewalls and a

23:45.125 --> 23:53.274
little short haircut and kind of reddish hair, and 
somebody said he looked like a lit cigarette. He

23:53.834 --> 23:59.941
never got rid of the nickname, and to this day, I was 
at the governor's swearing in, and somebody said,

23:53.834 --> 23:59.941
cigarette! I mean, that is his name, so you can't 
get away from it, even though he hates it. What was

24:04.586 --> 24:05.166
yours? Once I got into vet school, they called me 
Doc, and that was probably it, nothing. Remember

24:11.533 --> 24:13.495
one from the freshman year? No, I don't recall. I 
don't think I really had one. Carl Alexander, some

24:20.652 --> 24:32.625
of them called him Kunas or Kuni, which he hated 
because he was from New Orleans High Society and he

24:20.652 --> 24:32.625
was not, in his mind, was not Cajun, was not a Kunas, 
so he didn't like that.

24:35.848 --> 24:37.129
Let's see, who else? Were the nicknames a put-down 
term? are in effect a kind of a backhanded term of

24:40.019 --> 24:46.573
recognition. Always a term of recognition. 
Nicknames are only meaningful in families. And

24:52.867 --> 24:54.811
the core was family. So no, they were strictly. And 
so many people refer to people by their last name.

25:01.163 --> 25:30.782
dropping handles and having upperclassmen call 
you by your Christian name or your first name was a

25:01.163 --> 25:30.782
special thing but in amongst your own class you 
never referred to anybody by their first name but

25:01.163 --> 25:30.782
it was always by the last name and again that was uh 
that was part of being family and among when you

25:01.163 --> 25:30.782
were with some of those old outfit mates are the 
nicknames still used oh yeah just like uh right

25:01.163 --> 25:30.782
there and uh in the rotunda of the capitol somebody 
else cigarette uh Joe Weber would be the first

25:32.737 --> 25:37.363
member of our class, I guess, to get a star as a 
brigadier in the Marine Corps. And somehow he got

25:38.164 --> 25:42.430
the name of Joe Buck. And to this day, I don't care if 
he's got a star or what. If I see him, it's Joe Buck.

25:48.438 --> 25:49.279
And it's just the way it is. Are there some 
friendships you made that freshman year that have

25:51.462 --> 25:55.588
lasted? I was telling Kyle on the way up here today 
about how quickly you forget high school, at least

25:56.750 --> 26:15.626
I did, and yet the friendships of the Corps, it is 
truly, I saw two members that I hadn't seen since

25:56.750 --> 26:15.626
final review in Austin last month, and it was like 
yesterday. And so, yes, they're very deep,

26:15.967 --> 26:18.572
lasting friendships. Politically, they're on 
different sides of the fence, but both John Sharp

26:19.497 --> 26:23.862
and Rick Perry were in my outfit. And we all, when 
you live together, you die together. Chris

26:29.489 --> 26:34.855
Roberts runs Federal Land Bank out in Leveland and 
Brownfield. I haven't seen Chris in, I guess,

26:35.456 --> 26:40.982
since Final Review, and yet I've talked to him on 
the phone a couple times. And it's as if it were

26:41.587 --> 26:43.409
yesterday. Deep lasting friendships, there's no 
question. Carl Alexander, my freshman roommate

26:46.231 --> 26:52.077
second semester, went back to Louisiana. He 
really wanted to be part of the LSU scene. This is

26:56.581 --> 26:59.964
where he was raised, what he wanted to do, and to be a 
cheerleader at LSU. This is a big social thing, and

27:00.004 --> 27:04.728
to be Sigma Chi, and he did it. And he ended up being a 
cheerleader and did his fraternity stuff. but to

27:10.477 --> 27:13.631
this day we're still close friends and it's 
because of our time at A&M. It's a thing that his dad

27:14.897 --> 27:17.348
was class of 46 i think but um it really yeah you bond 
and it you don't you don't ever forget it uh rick and

27:19.538 --> 27:40.686
john were in your outfit in my outfit right 
describe them as freshmen as you recall both were

27:19.538 --> 27:40.686
politicians from the get-go which i i think you 
find in retrospect find interesting i can

27:19.538 --> 27:40.686
remember uh rick Rick's official lady was a guy 
named Chico Tuttle, Carl Tuttle. I don't have any

27:43.751 --> 27:48.640
idea what happened to him, but he was gone after our 
freshman year. Rick comes in, and the first thing

27:50.042 --> 27:55.792
he does is put a picture of a stunning brunette on 
his dresser. Turns out it was his older sister,

27:56.273 --> 27:57.815
Milla. But Rick's no fool. He puts that in. The 
upperclassmen come in and say, whoa, who's this?

28:04.477 --> 28:06.859
And it depended on what, you know, what 
upperclassmen. If a sophomore, you didn't care.

28:08.040 --> 28:11.644
But if a junior or senior asked, oh, that's my 
sister, Milla. And so Rick used Milla as bait. And

28:15.687 --> 28:18.730
quite effectively, a number of the upperclassmen 
had dates with her. She's a wonderful lady.

28:23.134 --> 28:23.975
Sharp, same way. Didn't have a picture of his 
sister, but always politicking. Both of them got

28:29.360 --> 28:32.863
along well with everyone else. Did they have 
nicknames?

28:37.662 --> 28:44.418
Sharp, somebody, we called him Shapp without the 
R. I was like you from the Lower East Side in

28:37.662 --> 28:44.418
Manhattan. And occasionally, some people call 
Ricky, Ricky Perry. Rick, they called him Ricky

28:51.811 --> 29:01.922
because he used to dislike it, and so we called him 
Ricky, but I don't recall any other nicknames.

29:05.326 --> 29:09.431
Both were good, loyal, strong outfit buddies. Did 
they get into their share of freshman mischief?

29:13.455 --> 29:16.198
Same as all, we were one for all, all for one. We had 
talked about the M-80 story. I manufactured the

29:20.241 --> 29:22.344
M-80s for the outfit. I've always liked 
pyrotechnics and had the wherewithal to make. It

29:26.649 --> 29:37.242
takes about 60 to 70 black cat firecrackers to make 
one M-80, and you've emptied out the gunpowder and

29:26.649 --> 29:37.242
put it in an M-80 case and a little waterproof 
cannon fuse, and you can flush it down anything.

29:37.272 --> 29:40.236
Where did you get the, did you always buy the 
firecrackers? I had the stuff, the firecrackers

29:40.256 --> 29:52.633
you could buy, in those days you could buy 
anywhere, and then I bought M-80 cases from a place

29:40.256 --> 29:52.633
in Arizona, and cannon fuse you could buy, 
advertised in a magazine, waterproof cannon

29:40.256 --> 29:52.633
fuse. So that one that John Sharp told me about the 
guy sitting on the stool reading the bat,

29:53.173 --> 30:02.166
you were a... It was an outfit production, but they 
were the ones that did it. What kind of punishment

30:05.977 --> 30:13.247
did anybody get as a result of that prank? I can't, I 
don't remember. I don't know if we got caught. I was

30:16.191 --> 30:17.133
going to say, must not... I don't, the key, there's 
the right way and the wrong way and the Aggie way.

30:21.138 --> 30:22.440
The key is not to get caught. Anybody can pull off 
something and get caught. No, the key is to not get

30:25.845 --> 30:28.008
caught. I guess back to the sadistic sophomore 
named Emmons that... crapped me out the first day I

30:35.423 --> 30:37.145
was at A&M. He was in squadron eight, and he was bad 
about that to the point that our upperclassmen

30:37.806 --> 30:44.696
took him to task a couple times. But he was bad about 
using an axe handle and that sort of thing. He'd

30:50.524 --> 30:52.126
gotten onto some of our freshmen. It was in the 
spring of our freshman year, and it had hurt one a

30:53.067 --> 30:59.476
little bit, and we'd had a lot of problems with him. 
So we called in a hit man from squadron 11. And the

31:04.280 --> 31:06.924
guy that came over had one of those tear gas pins. 
Emmons lived on the fourth floor, and so we fixed

31:07.645 --> 31:14.774
his door so he couldn't get out and lost the tear gas 
pin under the door. Well, he was a Marine wannabe

31:15.435 --> 31:26.170
and rappelled out of his window, but the rope 
broke, and he broke his ankles, and that's the last

31:15.435 --> 31:26.170
we saw of Mr. Emmons.
