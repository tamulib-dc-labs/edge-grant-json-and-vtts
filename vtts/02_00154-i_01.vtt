WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:29.869
back to Benson, but who had earned the respect of 
his colleagues

00:03.068 --> 00:29.869
because when Benson spoke on a point,

00:03.068 --> 00:29.869
everyone had learned that he had given it thought,

00:03.068 --> 00:29.869
careful thought

00:33.055 --> 00:33.816
and time.

00:37.940 --> 00:41.865
Never one to go on at length.

00:45.849 --> 00:58.523
Benson was a straight shooter

00:45.849 --> 00:58.523
with

00:45.849 --> 00:58.523
careful aim.

01:04.527 --> 01:27.345
Harry Cockel represented agriculture, a 
splendid researcher

01:04.527 --> 01:27.345
who had

01:04.527 --> 01:27.345
been able to attend A&M as an undergraduate living 
in the project houses during the Depression.

01:32.033 --> 01:35.557
with a good Germanic sense of humor and 
determination.

01:40.442 --> 02:01.163
He carried

01:40.442 --> 02:01.163
a big volume

01:40.442 --> 02:01.163
of influence because of the depth and breadth of 
agriculture, including the college experiment

02:02.611 --> 02:05.494
station, and extension service.

02:09.217 --> 02:18.806
Yet Harry looked at what was good for the 
university first.

02:18.826 --> 02:31.217
Dave Maxwell, a comparatively

02:18.826 --> 02:31.217
thin man who lived a little more than a block away 
from us

02:35.264 --> 02:59.131
just beyond Southwest Berkway,

02:35.264 --> 02:59.131
led the College of Liberal Arts, which was growing 
rapidly,

02:35.264 --> 02:59.131
and he too had high esteem among his colleagues.

02:59.151 --> 03:04.377
Mac Prescott, a tireless biochemist,

03:07.377 --> 03:19.508
had come over from that department located in the 
College of Agriculture to head science.

03:23.752 --> 03:35.443
No one was more determined

03:23.752 --> 03:35.443
to move his group forward than Mack, a former World 
War II Air Force crew member in the Pacific

03:37.094 --> 03:55.795
with a long and strong record of accomplishment in 
biochemistry.

04:11.992 --> 04:41.003
Dr. Alvin Price, in veterinary medicine, quote, 
slick owl, quote, to decades of students, was

04:11.992 --> 04:41.003
nearing the end of his splendid service,

04:11.992 --> 04:41.003
leading one of the nation's largest programs in 
veterinary medicine, but he too was a splendid

04:41.422 --> 04:43.364
veteran. Similarly, Ed Romanek,

04:45.187 --> 05:08.475
a comparatively unique Chicagoan,

04:45.187 --> 05:08.475
was the Dean of Architecture.

05:10.902 --> 05:21.977
And he always brightened up the sessions with his 
humor.

05:21.997 --> 05:35.616
Frank Hubert, who had been the Dean of Arts and 
Sciences before that unit was broken apart,

05:21.997 --> 05:35.616
now headed Education.

05:39.902 --> 05:40.723
But his

05:43.758 --> 05:58.056
Field of view was campus wide on many points and 
statewide on some.

06:01.361 --> 06:08.770
John Pearson was building business 
administration in quality and size.

06:15.230 --> 06:41.558
and Geosciences,

06:15.230 --> 06:41.558
I cannot remember the name right now of that dean, 
also

06:15.230 --> 06:41.558
was growing particularly in its national 
reputation in the fields of geology, geophysics,

06:15.230 --> 06:41.558
oceanography, and meteorology.

06:45.841 --> 07:02.482
Paragraph, thus there were no dark corners

06:45.841 --> 07:02.482
nor dead centers in the group.

07:06.186 --> 07:12.574
During the Calhoun years, paragraph, during the 
Calhoun years as dean of faculties, It was my task

07:13.955 --> 07:22.845
to lead a number of the searches for Dean's and 
other key administrative slots. The first of

07:25.068 --> 07:37.282
those came when Dean Price retired from 
veterinary medicine.

07:37.302 --> 07:40.165
Being a naive and inexperienced

07:42.693 --> 08:01.322
chairman of a search committee,

07:42.693 --> 08:01.322
I was part of a decision to interview eight 
finalists for that post. Dash, far too many.

08:09.575 --> 08:37.827
On the other hand, I am proud to recall

08:09.575 --> 08:37.827
that we tried to have each candidate

08:09.575 --> 08:37.827
visit with exactly the same

08:09.575 --> 08:37.827
groups

08:09.575 --> 08:37.827
of appropriate individuals relating to 
veterinary medicine, such as faculty, staff,

08:39.562 --> 09:07.054
fellow deans,

08:39.562 --> 09:07.054
students,

08:39.562 --> 09:07.054
and some

08:39.562 --> 09:07.054
that include graduates of veterinary medicine on 
some of those groups. Similarly,

09:14.158 --> 09:34.729
I tried to ensure that each group asked the same

09:14.158 --> 09:34.729
questions

09:14.158 --> 09:34.729
of each candidate

09:14.158 --> 09:34.729
and that where possible

09:37.477 --> 09:56.579
The sessions were held in the same room and the same 
sequence

09:37.477 --> 09:56.579
for each

09:37.477 --> 09:56.579
of the candidates.

09:56.599 --> 09:57.040
Paragraph. Finally, when the lengthy process

09:57.060 --> 10:07.011
of reviewing an octet

10:10.163 --> 10:15.229
of visitors was completed.

10:17.933 --> 10:39.040
I then went back to each interview group

10:17.933 --> 10:39.040
and asked them to rank all of the interviewees

10:17.933 --> 10:39.040
in a weighted tally

10:17.933 --> 10:39.040
fashion.

10:45.601 --> 11:04.083
When that calculation was completed,

10:45.601 --> 11:04.083
it was clear that two individuals were far ahead of 
the others in the evaluation process.

11:06.606 --> 11:14.916
One had been dean at Ohio State for perhaps two 
years recently,

11:15.773 --> 11:44.127
but had then left

11:15.773 --> 11:44.127
in a huff, apparently having told some of the 
campus leadership where they could go and what

11:15.773 --> 11:44.127
they could do when they got there.

11:51.667 --> 11:57.156
To me, this

11:51.667 --> 11:57.156
man seemed exciting. Some of his ideas relating to 
A&M's veterinary medical potential

11:58.598 --> 12:18.231
seemed highly innovative,

11:58.598 --> 12:18.231
and others, while imaginative, were clearly 
controversial. The word, quote, exciting,

12:20.455 --> 12:30.508
quote, seemed to jump into my

12:20.455 --> 12:30.508
evaluation of it. The other leader was a native 
Texan and graduate of A&M, George Shelton, then

12:33.312 --> 12:48.792
the Associate Dean of Veterinary Medicine at the 
University of Missouri.

12:53.445 --> 13:18.036
By comparison with the other frontrunner,

12:53.445 --> 13:18.036
Dr. Shelton was comparatively reserved,

12:53.445 --> 13:18.036
quiet, always composed, pleasant and would 
obviously never provoke any camp any great

13:19.703 --> 13:49.322
upheaval

13:19.703 --> 13:49.322
paragraph thus when i reviewed the

13:19.703 --> 13:49.322
two front runners when i reviewed the search 
process

13:54.314 --> 13:59.699
first with Vice President Calhoun, and then Dr. 
Williams.

14:05.164 --> 14:23.460
I indicated that

14:05.164 --> 14:23.460
the former dean of Ohio State would be, quote, 
exciting, yet there might often be upheaval and

14:05.164 --> 14:23.460
controversy.

14:24.976 --> 14:53.397
things quote would never but quote things would 
never be dull period quote

14:24.976 --> 14:53.397
after giving that evaluation to president 
williams he asked me to write the other man

14:24.976 --> 14:53.397
and i told him that dr shelton seemed to be a an 
individual who would calmly, quietly,

14:54.389 --> 15:10.808
carefully, and consistently

14:54.389 --> 15:10.808
lead veterinary medicine to improvement and 
higher achievement.

15:14.932 --> 15:17.896
Without any delay, he said, let's go with Shelton. 
I've got enough damn excitement in my life

15:19.818 --> 15:23.502
already. I need peace and quiet wherever we can 
find it.

15:39.214 --> 15:44.360
After the Shelton's moved to College Station. By 
luck.

15:48.244 --> 15:49.485
Dash or perhaps. By divine providence.

15:55.510 --> 16:03.041
The football and basketball season tickets for 
the Shelton's and the Monroe's were side by side.

16:06.165 --> 16:22.648
As George sometimes phrased it, he and my wife, Jo, 
quietly observed as Joey and I second-guessed the

16:06.165 --> 16:22.648
coaches In both those sports. We became good 
friends.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.260
And I.

16:39.104 --> 16:40.825
Certainly develop.

16:43.788 --> 16:48.472
A deep and abiding respect. For the Shelton's, 
especially for George. As a very. capable

16:54.218 --> 16:57.341
professional leader. Paragraph again, possibly 
my luck

16:59.984 --> 17:11.296
or influence from above.

17:14.259 --> 17:21.947
When the search committee

17:14.259 --> 17:21.947
was seeking a new chancellor at the University of 
Missouri, In 1987, the

17:24.256 --> 17:39.551
president of the Missouri Alumni Association 
served on the search committee.

17:45.237 --> 17:52.204
He, a very highly regarded lawyer and future state 
senator,

17:56.116 --> 18:11.680
noticed

17:56.116 --> 18:11.680
that one of the finalists

17:56.116 --> 18:11.680
had served for a number of years, had served for 
more than two decades at Texas A&M.

18:14.524 --> 18:19.592
Thus, he picked up the phone and called

18:30.440 --> 18:53.606
a man who had held

18:30.440 --> 18:53.606
an office adjoining that of his father in the 
College of Veteran Medicine at Missouri for a

18:30.440 --> 18:53.606
number of years.

18:53.626 --> 18:58.472
He asked this man, whom he had referred to as Uncle 
George, quote, because

18:59.971 --> 19:29.151
when this future MU alum leader was growing up,

18:59.971 --> 19:29.151
he would visit with George Shilton while he was 
waiting for his father.

19:32.523 --> 20:01.770
Thus, when Uncle George gave very positive 
evaluations

19:32.523 --> 20:01.770
of the former dean of faculties at A&M,

19:32.523 --> 20:01.770
that evaluation

19:32.523 --> 20:01.770
was given a high rating

19:32.523 --> 20:01.770
by the

20:05.311 --> 20:09.998
Missouri alumni leader and his search committee 
colleagues.

20:19.312 --> 20:30.508
Another paragraph, another search

20:19.312 --> 20:30.508
here that

20:19.312 --> 20:30.508
had a

20:33.087 --> 20:44.806
more complicated process

20:33.087 --> 20:44.806
was the attempt to replace Ed Romanek when he 
retired.

20:48.471 --> 21:00.310
A number of individuals were were sought

20:48.471 --> 21:00.310
and I believe that Dr. Winerdi was the coordinator 
of that search.

21:09.454 --> 21:17.884
But I certainly was involved a great deal.

21:17.904 --> 21:29.757
Finally,

21:17.904 --> 21:29.757
we identified a man from the University of Arizona 
who seemed very, very promising.

21:32.420 --> 21:58.680
and related that evaluation to Dr. Calhoun,

21:32.420 --> 21:58.680
who then directed us to proceed and quote,

21:32.420 --> 21:58.680
hire him

21:32.420 --> 21:58.680
regardless of the salary we have to offer, period, 
quote.

22:03.740 --> 22:08.246
with optimism in our efforts. When Erdi and I 
chatted with the Arizona

22:09.247 --> 22:29.292
prospect on the phone,

22:09.247 --> 22:29.292
finally found a salary that he would accept and 
went back to Dr. Calhoun

22:09.247 --> 22:29.292
to report our success.

22:32.107 --> 22:58.418
only to be stunned at his decision that we had gone 
too high and that we should go back and reduce the

22:32.107 --> 22:58.418
salary

22:32.107 --> 22:58.418
or terminate the offer,

22:32.107 --> 22:58.418
which we had to do.

23:03.713 --> 23:13.664
In hindsight, I shall always wonder what would 
have been the result if that very promising man had

23:03.713 --> 23:13.664
been located.

23:21.072 --> 23:29.181
Another search was

23:21.072 --> 23:29.181
for the director of university libraries.

23:35.962 --> 24:05.867
and included a wide variety of interviewees, 
including probably the first black

23:35.962 --> 24:05.867
candidate

23:35.962 --> 24:05.867
at such a high administrative level on the campus, 
along with a highly capable woman.

24:11.602 --> 24:35.483
Once more, when Erdi and I were together in the 
effort,

24:11.602 --> 24:35.483
and when we summarized

24:11.602 --> 24:35.483
the process,

24:11.602 --> 24:35.483
we urged that the black man

24:38.281 --> 25:02.888
who had been very successful at the University of 
Houston,

24:38.281 --> 25:02.888
be our target

24:38.281 --> 25:02.888
without any hint at all

24:38.281 --> 25:02.888
of any racial reason for his evaluation. Calhoun 
directed us to proceed to recruit the woman,

25:03.880 --> 25:27.446
Dr. Irene Hoadley, who was the number three person 
in the administrative hierarchy at Ohio State

25:03.880 --> 25:27.446
University.

25:27.466 --> 25:33.212
Ironically, the man would be that we failed to 
pursue would be selected as the director of

25:33.817 --> 25:51.016
libraries at one of the great Ivy League schools a 
year or so later.

25:51.037 --> 26:01.208
One of the most

25:51.037 --> 26:01.208
memorable searches for me occurred at A&M, 
occurred just a few months, a few weeks before we

26:02.791 --> 26:19.729
moved to

26:02.791 --> 26:19.729
the task of president at University of Texas at El 
Paso. This was search for a new dean of education

26:22.232 --> 26:32.663
because Frank Hubert

26:35.309 --> 26:43.979
had moved up to chancellor of the Texas A&M system.

26:43.999 --> 27:04.624
By then, I felt somewhat, I felt experienced in 
dean searches and we were able to proceed with the

26:43.999 --> 27:04.624
process

26:43.999 --> 27:04.624
of

27:09.515 --> 27:38.914
similar questions

27:09.515 --> 27:38.914
as a part of a uniform schedule

27:09.515 --> 27:38.914
and an emphasis that each member of every 
interview group

27:09.515 --> 27:38.914
would attempt to make direct personal contacts 
with individuals that they knew well who might be

27:40.295 --> 27:52.890
able to evaluate this individual.

27:52.910 --> 28:07.787
That practice had come as a result

27:52.910 --> 28:07.787
of our becoming convinced that written letters of 
evaluation from the applicant or nominee's

28:09.404 --> 28:23.457
references

28:09.404 --> 28:23.457
usually contain nothing but glowing praise.

28:23.477 --> 28:38.871
Further inquiries

28:23.477 --> 28:38.871
to individuals

28:23.477 --> 28:38.871
that were unknown,

28:23.477 --> 28:38.871
who were strangers, to A&M inquirers

28:39.948 --> 29:05.376
sometimes resulted in meaningless or even

28:39.948 --> 29:05.376
unreliable information.

29:07.899 --> 29:08.520
Thus I always tried to emphasize the essentiality

29:09.445 --> 29:31.212
of contacting individuals known directly.

29:31.232 --> 29:35.638
Another matter of emphasis in the search 
processes which I could affect

29:37.930 --> 30:04.748
was to urge

29:37.930 --> 30:04.748
that an effort be made to find out why an apparently 
highly capable individual would be willing to

30:06.280 --> 30:13.570
consider another appointment?

30:13.590 --> 30:26.189
Or, in other words, was this individual needing to 
find another slot because they were about to lose

30:13.590 --> 30:26.189
the one they had?

30:31.777 --> 30:35.562
Paragraph, in the search for a new dean of 
education, that became a reality.

30:39.187 --> 30:58.872
regarding

30:39.187 --> 30:58.872
two of the

30:39.187 --> 30:58.872
key

30:39.187 --> 30:58.872
candidates.

30:58.892 --> 31:03.658
One of the interviewees arrived on the campus a 
couple of hours after my wife and I returned to

31:05.714 --> 31:20.078
College Station from our three-day on-campus 
visit

31:05.714 --> 31:20.078
and interview sessions
