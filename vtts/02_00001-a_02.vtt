WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:13.867
I saw a stipend with the department for a fellowship, and then she worked for Clark, and she made $250 a month.

00:13.907 --> 00:14.949
I made $200 a month.

00:15.129 --> 00:17.192
Where did y'all live in those days?

00:17.213 --> 00:22.441
We lived in an apartment there behind the campus theater, about two blocks behind the campus theater.

00:22.461 --> 00:23.823
It was $65 a month.

00:24.043 --> 00:26.427
We had all the money we needed.

00:27.082 --> 00:30.707
What did a young couple do for enjoyment?

00:31.949 --> 00:45.808
Well, we didn't do a whole lot because I worked most day and night, but what we did do was we would go skiing, usually over Christmas break, something like that.

00:46.209 --> 00:56.143
Other than that, the usual graduate student parties and things occasionally during the semester, but those were days of heavy, heavy work.

00:56.478 --> 01:00.426
and those parties would have been held in somebody's apartment?

01:01.568 --> 01:02.850
Yes, usually.

01:03.231 --> 01:08.281
Sometimes departmental parties, parties for the graduate student.

01:10.024 --> 01:14.773
Sometimes we'd go out on the river, cook out on the river.

01:14.753 --> 01:18.300
But you pretty well made your own entertainment in those days.

01:20.745 --> 01:23.270
There were the local beer halls and such, I guess.

01:24.052 --> 01:25.935
I never did participate much in those.

01:27.979 --> 01:34.332
When you came back as a young faculty member, where did you find a place to live?

01:34.598 --> 01:48.608
We lived in a nice apartment complex, Redmond Terrace, where we lived until we bought a little home, which we did in, I guess we stayed in the apartment a couple years and then bought a house.

01:49.162 --> 02:04.723
Did y'all think that there were any guidelines either spoken, written, or just simply understood of conduct for a young faculty couple?

02:06.138 --> 02:11.966
I just understood the, certainly there were things like dress code.

02:12.046 --> 02:15.772
I would certainly not be found this way on campus in those days.

02:16.252 --> 02:17.714
So you wore, so you wore coat and tie?

02:17.774 --> 02:18.395
Coat and tie.

02:19.216 --> 02:22.141
And so did everybody else.

02:24.063 --> 02:30.913
What about, what about parties, drinking, anything like that?

02:30.893 --> 02:32.738
A few parties.

02:33.279 --> 02:39.657
A young faculty member of the most of the departmental entertainment was by the department head.

02:40.559 --> 02:45.713
Gil Ploss had become department head and was department head for nine years and he and

02:46.334 --> 02:52.445
And Farah would organize three or four physics department parties throughout the year.

02:53.326 --> 02:55.390
So the... And they would host them where?

02:55.691 --> 02:55.971
At their home?

02:55.991 --> 03:06.570
They would host the Christmas party at their home, and then the, there were picnic parties at the, in the park sometimes.

03:09.942 --> 03:13.166
And I guess others at other people's homes.

03:13.246 --> 03:16.050
I don't really recall.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.353
I'm assuming I'm about to ask a very positive question.

03:18.914 --> 03:22.538
What was, what impression did you and Carolyn have of the Places?

03:22.558 --> 03:24.701
Oh, well they were just outstanding people.

03:24.841 --> 03:35.094
And they, they'd have dinner parties and of course they were very nice but somewhat awkward.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.599
Awkward?

03:39.440 --> 03:55.527
Yes, it was sitting around the table with the plusses and the culture was a little deeper than my background had led me to, so I certainly feel a little out of water on some of these occasions.

03:57.069 --> 04:03.540
But they're delightful people and thoroughly enjoyed our interactions with them over the years.

04:03.723 --> 04:07.453
Were you aware early on of their deep interest in music?

04:07.473 --> 04:08.054
Yes, yes.

04:08.074 --> 04:08.355
Oh, yes.

04:08.836 --> 04:16.095
And I love the, which you may remember, the letter to the editor in The Eagle, who is this woman who would dare criticize?

04:16.936 --> 04:18.017
Were you here for that?

04:18.438 --> 04:18.999
I think so.

04:19.600 --> 04:31.476
And the Eagles editor responded to that question and listed Thyra's credentials that were truly outstanding.

04:35.781 --> 04:38.505
What was Dr. Plass like as department chairman?

04:39.160 --> 04:39.861
Just that.

04:39.881 --> 04:41.184
He was a chairman.

04:42.186 --> 04:43.829
A very, very pleasant man.

04:44.470 --> 04:51.783
Very, very difficult for him to do anything that was difficult to do.

04:53.406 --> 04:55.009
We had people who should have been fired.

04:55.089 --> 05:02.603
We had people who should have been disciplined, and that just not was what he...

05:02.583 --> 05:09.110
We had all kinds of things going on in those days that the fellow responsible should have been fired.

05:09.130 --> 05:15.137
There was an incident of a rifle being taken and shot a hole through the military science window.

05:17.159 --> 05:22.625
We had a staff person who, those were the early days of Auditrons for the Xerox machine.

05:22.645 --> 05:30.514
He rewired one so he could use any Xerox machine on campus and not have to pay for it, and still Gill couldn't bring himself to fire the guy.

05:30.494 --> 05:31.596
These were faculty members?

05:31.616 --> 05:32.958
No, these were staff members.

05:32.978 --> 05:34.340
Oh, staff members, staff members.

05:35.041 --> 05:37.966
And he was department chairman from what?

05:37.986 --> 05:44.135
Sixty-nine to sixty-eight to seventy-nine.

05:44.736 --> 05:48.402
No, he was nine years.

05:49.411 --> 05:53.879
Must have been 69 to 78 maybe, something like that.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.003
The department was growing during that period.

05:56.023 --> 05:56.925
Yes, yes.

05:56.965 --> 06:00.031
He brought in a number of our people who are still here.

06:00.812 --> 06:03.237
In fact, we'll be honoring one of them Friday morning.

06:03.477 --> 06:04.539
Who's Ed?

06:04.560 --> 06:05.361
Ed Fry.

06:05.341 --> 06:06.643
F-R-Y-E?

06:07.224 --> 06:07.865
No, F-R-Y.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.528
F-R-Y.

06:10.069 --> 06:13.856
See, I have to say some things about Ed Friday morning.

06:13.896 --> 06:21.409
That's the reason I have his offer letter here because he has been an outstanding faculty member and this is a seminar in his honor.

06:21.558 --> 06:26.969
And we have outstanding speakers coming from all over the world to honor him.

06:27.249 --> 06:33.401
And so I'm going to start off by telling what his starting salary was and comment on what a bargain we got.

06:38.552 --> 06:41.477
How was Dr. Plass identified?

06:41.578 --> 06:43.802
What was the process that brought him here, do you know?

06:44.693 --> 06:47.104
There was a committee.

06:47.385 --> 06:48.028
A real search.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.022
And I wasn't aware.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.775
I was working too hard in those days to pay any attention to what

06:54.548 --> 06:57.111
I was just trying to stay out of trouble because I was aligned with Squire.

06:57.171 --> 07:01.396
Squire was the problem for the rest of the faculty, and I was just trying to survive.

07:02.318 --> 07:07.003
And so I stayed in my lab, worked, and paid as little attention to the politics as I could.

07:07.364 --> 07:19.919
And the first thing I knew that PLOS was coming was that Joe Hamm took me aside one time and told me that we had a new department head and that he would be arriving sometime sometime.

07:19.939 --> 07:23.003
And so Gil showed up.

07:22.983 --> 07:25.387
It was many, many years before it was Gil Plas.

07:26.229 --> 07:27.351
It was Dr. Plas.

07:30.136 --> 07:38.831
And if there was some dissension in the department when he arrived, he helped to subdue it?

07:38.851 --> 07:39.011
Oh, yes.

07:39.171 --> 07:39.612
Yes, yes.

07:39.752 --> 07:46.324
No, things settled down, and there was dissension because of the way that

07:46.304 --> 07:50.550
that Squire was running the department.

07:51.811 --> 07:58.300
And Squire's first act as department has was to fire a faculty member.

07:58.320 --> 08:11.637
And so there was a lot of resentment because of that, but there also was resentment for other things that he was doing heavy-handedly.

08:12.173 --> 08:17.720
Dr. Plass was brought in because he had quite the opposite opinion of how things should run.

08:17.740 --> 08:22.126
And so he came in as a department chair.

08:23.268 --> 08:29.756
And the department operated in, best I could tell, a very fair fashion with everybody having their say.

08:29.776 --> 08:40.029
And as far as I know, that was the first time the faculty ever had a committee that had input on the salary increases and that sort of thing.

08:40.330 --> 08:40.851
Under Plass?

08:41.051 --> 08:42.012
Under Plass.

08:42.515 --> 08:55.933
There are a lot of faculty now who think that came in under a more recent department head, but I was on a committee that sat with PLOS and evaluated faculty for salary increases.

08:56.032 --> 09:02.919
All right, in that process, what factors did that committee try to evaluate?

09:03.400 --> 09:12.329
Well, that's been a humorous point for me over the years, too, because when I first came on the faculty, the physics, your physics was judged by the publication.

09:12.349 --> 09:14.071
You published a lot of papers.

09:14.091 --> 09:15.112
You were a good physicist.

09:15.773 --> 09:17.815
Nobody paid much attention to the quality of the publication.

09:17.915 --> 09:22.680
During Plas's regime, that shifted to citations.

09:22.660 --> 09:31.763
And so it became very important during those nine years to have citations, because now you're not just counting papers, you're counting something that's more important.

09:31.784 --> 09:33.749
You're counting citations to those papers.

09:34.611 --> 09:38.982
Well, certainly not too long after PLOS's period,

09:39.434 --> 09:44.361
The whole university went into accounting dollar mode, and that's the mode I think we're in now.

09:44.382 --> 09:51.472
Doesn't matter what you do in physics, but if you're bringing in big bucks, you're gonna have the attention of the administration.

09:51.492 --> 09:53.155
Doesn't matter that you never produce anything.

09:53.275 --> 09:56.941
You're bringing in big dollars, so, and we have something like that.

09:56.961 --> 10:03.370
What about teaching effort, ability, quality, was that?

10:03.471 --> 10:07.737
The teaching over the years in physics, I think, has been quite good.

10:07.835 --> 10:09.557
But no, but in that period?

10:09.677 --> 10:12.000
Oh, during that period it was quite good.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.263
No, but was it a factor in the?

10:14.283 --> 10:15.144
Oh, in the evaluation?

10:16.086 --> 10:17.227
Yes, I think so.

10:17.247 --> 10:17.988
I think so.

10:18.349 --> 10:20.531
But it certainly was a very small part of it.

10:26.719 --> 10:35.631
It was commented on and it was some pressures to do a better job teaching.

10:37.079 --> 10:42.344
I think it was after that time that we went to a teaching evaluation by the students.

10:43.045 --> 10:46.568
I don't believe that started with PLOS, but it had been about that time.

10:46.648 --> 10:51.853
Was there any effort to help new faculty members get started?

10:51.933 --> 10:54.936
Was there any kind of advising system or?

10:55.557 --> 10:56.237
Nothing formal.

10:56.758 --> 10:58.440
Nothing formal.

10:59.861 --> 11:06.107
There's still not much.

11:08.197 --> 11:33.259
Certainly there there's help for, there was help then for young faculty getting started and financial support and some help writing proposals and usually a young person was brought in into a group where there were senior faculty members so there were there were informal help and but the

11:34.690 --> 11:41.648
Over the years, the importance of the teaching, the classroom teaching end of it has become more and more important.

11:43.513 --> 11:46.360
Dr. Zener was the first dean of science?

11:46.380 --> 11:46.460
Yes.

11:46.480 --> 11:51.012
And how did you evaluate him from the physics point of view?

11:50.992 --> 11:53.899
He was sort of a strange person.

11:54.841 --> 12:06.570
I never did feel that he had much control of the college, and it seems that he didn't have much control of the finances, and I think that he was removed because of finances.

12:06.668 --> 12:14.063
Did y'all feel that physics was getting as much attention as it deserved?

12:14.083 --> 12:14.604
Oh yeah.

12:14.624 --> 12:16.087
Compared to the other departments?

12:16.267 --> 12:22.580
We were with Zaner as dean and Squire as associate dean and there was lots of support.

12:23.161 --> 12:26.888
But then we moved into Zaner gone and

12:27.222 --> 12:28.324
Byers?

12:28.565 --> 12:41.229
Well, Byers was an interim, because you probably know that story, but they tried to hire Mike Prescott as dean, and he refused it.

12:41.830 --> 12:48.623
So we moved into Byers as interim dean, and then a year later, Prescott agreed to take it.

12:48.755 --> 12:50.937
And Byers moved up to the vice president.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.339
Well, he was still, he was vice president at the same time he was our dean.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.080
Oh, that's right, that's right.

12:54.120 --> 12:54.701
Yes, yes, yes.

12:54.721 --> 12:56.483
He was just, he was doing both jobs.

12:57.544 --> 13:09.956
And so then when Mac came in as the dean, I guess Byers was the vice president for a year or so, maybe longer.

13:10.957 --> 13:16.382
Well, yeah, because before Byers we had

13:18.151 --> 13:22.563
Vice President, Academic Vice President, Ralph.

13:24.769 --> 13:28.159
Wasn't it Wayne Hall?

13:28.379 --> 13:34.135
Yeah, that's who it was, Wayne Hall, yeah, Wayne Hall.

13:36.612 --> 13:41.922
Under Prescott then, that was about the same time that Martell became very strong.

13:42.804 --> 13:49.857
And so the resources from the college went heavily into chemistry and did for many, many years.

13:50.919 --> 13:59.295
From a physics point of view, can you offer any description of Mac as the dean of science?

13:59.275 --> 14:04.767
Yes, he was a good dean, I think.

14:06.010 --> 14:09.438
He certainly was a dictatorial type dean.

14:11.603 --> 14:16.474
He had great assistance from John Beckham.

14:16.454 --> 14:19.698
Oh, describe John Beckham.

14:19.718 --> 14:22.000
Oh, Superman.

14:23.382 --> 14:24.603
John kept the place going.

14:24.703 --> 14:37.737
He was the person most concerned with students and most concerned with doing what's right for the students, and yeah, John was a great one.

14:37.757 --> 14:41.922
Mac Prescott was the dean

14:43.268 --> 14:49.581
when I was the chairman of the search committee for the new physics department head.

14:49.601 --> 15:01.525
And when we didn't find one then he asked me to be the interim department head and without telling me he was on his way to being vice president.

15:01.545 --> 15:02.948
Maybe he didn't know, I don't know.

15:02.928 --> 15:07.274
And so he went off to be vice president with Jarvis.

15:07.294 --> 15:18.889
And then John Beckham was the interim dean while we waited for Tom Sugihara to come back off leave to become the real dean.

15:18.909 --> 15:30.925
Now then the part of this story that not many people know is that Mack told me who was going to be the next dean the day that he told me that he was going to be the vice president.

15:30.945 --> 15:31.686
That was Sugihara.

15:33.168 --> 15:40.940
And then some month later or so, he formed a search committee and named George Catawar chairman of the search committee.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.664
And poor George was running around here thinking he's doing something.

15:44.906 --> 15:48.832
Still might, because they came up with three candidates.

15:48.953 --> 15:58.247
One of them was Tom Sugahari, and so Mac went ahead and named Tom Sugahari, as he had always planned to do.

15:58.227 --> 16:06.683
There is a story here that I will have a tough time ever forgiving Mac for, and that's this building.

16:09.549 --> 16:19.307
We were located in a very, very nice building, as you well know, in a prime, prime part of campus, and I wanted to stay there.

16:21.093 --> 16:27.890
And so I argued with Max that we needed to build a building in that parking lot 19.

16:29.755 --> 16:33.405
And that would be our research tower.

16:33.425 --> 16:36.573
We could then build a walkway from the tower to the old building.

16:36.653 --> 16:37.836
We'd move into the tower.

16:38.204 --> 16:44.582
remodel the old building, and then we would have a nice, beautiful complex for physics.

16:44.602 --> 16:51.120
And we'd be where we had been since 1912, I believe, something like that.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.226
And he said no.

16:53.206 --> 16:54.527
Now why did he say no?

16:55.088 --> 17:19.571
He said no because Tom Sugihara was a chemist, had a research lab in the cyclotron and he wanted a new office in the next building built for the College of Science and therefore he talked Mac Prescott into building this building here and physics would come here and it would have a dean of science complex and then Sugihara could be right next door to his damn research lab.

17:19.591 --> 17:20.952
I probably shouldn't say that on the way.

17:22.619 --> 17:28.455
And that infuriated me, that a decision like that would be made so that Sugihara could be there.

17:28.877 --> 17:32.366
By the time we got the building, Sugihara was gone.

17:32.386 --> 17:37.641
And John Fackler had no desire to move into

17:37.621 --> 17:43.094
the dean's office over here, and so that idea got scrapped and there just was no excuse.

17:43.515 --> 17:51.735
I also went to Prescott and I said, Mac, all right, you're going to force us to move over there, then surely you're going to build a building big enough that we can do our teaching in that building.

17:51.755 --> 17:54.702
No, you're going to teach in Hildenfelsen.

17:54.722 --> 17:56.085
So my faculty right now

17:57.382 --> 18:02.427
have their offices here, and 90% of our teaching is done clear across campus in Heldenfeld.

18:03.989 --> 18:05.410
This makes no sense.

18:05.891 --> 18:08.113
Who inherited the old physics building?

18:09.495 --> 18:12.238
That's when they twisted the blade, psychology.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.620
Psychology.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.003
And that, you all moved out of there about what year?

18:17.924 --> 18:21.027
Oh, I guess we've been here 12 years, 13 maybe.

18:22.576 --> 18:24.861
I've forgotten, but it must have been... Late 80s?

18:25.162 --> 18:28.329
87, 88, 88 maybe.

18:28.349 --> 18:30.454
88, I would guess.

18:30.574 --> 18:33.120
Let's go back and pick up some senior administrators.

18:33.140 --> 18:36.607
When you came back, Earl Rutter was the president.

18:36.968 --> 18:40.416
What was the impression that you and your colleagues had of him as president?

18:41.763 --> 19:03.791
Well, I can't say a whole lot about my colleagues, but I thought he was an outstanding president, and I have said ever since that time he was the only president we could have had at that time that would have gotten us where we were able to go, and that is non-compulsory core and co-ed.

19:03.811 --> 19:07.956
I certainly agree with you, but what led you to those conclusions?

19:08.577 --> 19:21.475
Because I know all my friends across this great state of Texas and their beliefs about this university being an all-male, all-military, and that was a strong feeling in those days.

19:21.495 --> 19:27.663
And anybody else trying to make those decisions that General Rudder made would have been run out of town because he didn't understand Aggies.

19:27.683 --> 19:28.925
He didn't understand this place.

19:28.985 --> 19:30.687
He was anti-military.

19:30.707 --> 19:32.610
Well, you couldn't make those charges against General Rudder.

19:33.198 --> 19:40.446
So you had to accept what he was saying, because he was all military.

19:40.486 --> 19:42.368
He was pro-Corp cadets.

19:42.388 --> 19:50.116
He was pro, and yet he was carrying this university to non-compulsory corps and co-ed.

19:50.577 --> 19:56.083
Now what most people don't know is this was not the first time this university had gone non-compulsory corps.

19:56.182 --> 19:58.745
Because my sophomore year, this university changed.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.327
I don't know anything about the history of all that.

20:00.647 --> 20:05.233
But I know that 1954, entering freshmen did not have to join the Corps of Cadets.

20:06.334 --> 20:11.440
And I had a number of friends who got out of the Corps of Cadets that year because it was not compulsory.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.022
It was what, for two years?

20:13.042 --> 20:15.545
I don't remember because it stayed that way until I graduated.

20:15.565 --> 20:16.586
And I graduated in 57.

20:16.866 --> 20:21.792
At least I think it stayed that way until I graduated because I was not aware if it changed back.

20:22.332 --> 20:22.813
It was brief.

20:23.165 --> 20:32.210
And then by the time I came back in 62, it was all, it was back to all military and non-Quaid.

20:32.230 --> 20:36.482
How much did you, in those early years, how often did you see Earl Rudder?

20:37.947 --> 20:38.528
Oh, yes.

20:38.548 --> 20:39.249
How visible was he?

20:39.269 --> 20:41.172
Oh, he was fairly visible out on campus.

20:41.192 --> 20:42.434
I'd see him walking around campus.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.516
I'd see him in the MSC.

20:43.636 --> 20:53.192
I'd see him in the MSC coffee shop, and I distinctly remember one time walking in the aisle of that old coffee shop area, and he was right behind me and chatting, and yeah.

20:53.753 --> 21:01.827
I think, and it certainly was my impression that he enjoyed being out on campus and talking to students, and so yeah, I'd see him around.

21:02.848 --> 21:03.870
You were here when he died.

21:04.323 --> 21:05.125
I was here when he died.

21:05.325 --> 21:08.651
Were you aware that his health was declining?

21:08.671 --> 21:08.872
No.

21:09.052 --> 21:09.794
I certainly wasn't.

21:10.174 --> 21:11.697
I heard stories afterwards.

21:11.777 --> 21:12.559
Andy Suttle was.

21:13.581 --> 21:15.705
Andy Suttle was aware that his health was declining.

21:15.725 --> 21:20.374
I'm told by Charles Squire that there were trips to Houston where they would

21:20.557 --> 21:27.472
where General Rudder would drive out to the city limits and pull off the side of the road and get in the back seat and tell Andy to drive to Houston.

21:28.874 --> 21:30.077
Have you heard any of those stories?

21:30.097 --> 21:30.939
Yeah, I've heard that, yeah.

21:30.959 --> 21:36.270
Yeah, yeah, and that was because General Rudder was in bad health and didn't want anybody to know it.

21:36.250 --> 21:41.456
And what, how did you hear that he had died?

21:41.736 --> 21:42.197
Do you remember?

21:42.838 --> 21:45.180
I don't remember any specific.

21:47.403 --> 21:51.347
I, I, he was in the hospital for some time.

21:51.367 --> 22:02.460
So I knew, somehow I knew that, that he was not doing well and then, then I suspect I heard it on the news or something.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.763
Then Ludicke was the interim.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.004
General Ludicke was the interim.

22:05.984 --> 22:11.493
And then the next president, what was your impression of him?

22:12.996 --> 22:21.991
The next president was Jack Williams, and I have on numerous occasions said to numerous people that Jack Williams was the best president this university has ever had or ever will have.

22:24.235 --> 22:25.016
I'm on your side.

22:26.719 --> 22:31.367
What caused you to feel that he was so capable?

22:32.883 --> 22:35.146
Just watching him work, watching him operate.

22:35.507 --> 22:45.421
One of my, really, really, you know, I ought to go see, maybe, I hope they exist somewhere, but I should have kept a copy of every letter he ever wrote.

22:45.702 --> 22:46.283
I should have.

22:46.823 --> 22:51.510
The man's correspondence was unbelievable.

22:51.871 --> 22:56.177
I was just amazed by his letters.

22:56.197 --> 23:00.223
And when I worked in his office, I'm sure you know this, but

23:00.997 --> 23:02.941
I read every letter he ever wrote.

23:02.961 --> 23:04.163
I'm sure there were a few exceptions.

23:04.644 --> 23:11.137
But his policy was that every letter he wrote was circulated amongst the staff.

23:12.059 --> 23:15.446
Every letter I wrote was circulated amongst the staff.

23:15.466 --> 23:21.418
So every letter he wrote, I read, Nelda read, Bob Cherry read.

23:22.394 --> 23:23.495
and then we'd pass them on.

23:23.515 --> 23:32.506
They were carbon copies in those days and I'd get a file every morning that had his correspondence and I'd thumb through those letters and the intent's obvious.

23:32.526 --> 23:34.969
He wanted everybody in his office to know what was going on.

23:35.009 --> 23:37.873
How did you come to work in his office?

23:38.293 --> 23:40.496
Describe how that came about.

23:41.497 --> 23:50.008
I suspect you had something to do with it and I'm sure Ed Cooper had something to do with it because I'd known you two over the years.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.810
I didn't know Dr. Williams from

23:52.077 --> 23:53.439
I mean, he wouldn't know me from anybody.

23:53.499 --> 23:56.585
In fact, I remember distinctly meeting him for the first time.

23:58.648 --> 24:08.145
But I had, in 1970, Mac Prescott had asked me to come over as assistant to the dean.

24:08.165 --> 24:12.513
So I was assistant to dean with Prescott for two years.

24:12.533 --> 24:14.997
And then the first thing I knew was

24:14.977 --> 24:23.166
I'd heard that Cooper was gonna go over and be deemed omissions and records, but I hadn't paid much attention to it or who was gonna replace him or anything.

24:23.186 --> 24:31.074
And I was over having coffee in the MSC with Don Noggle and Roland Allen and minding our own business.

24:31.094 --> 24:37.081
And I noticed there, Dr. Williams walked in and Cooper, and you may have been there, I don't remember.

24:38.082 --> 24:43.988
And so I just noticed and I probably spoke to people there and then a couple of tables over.

24:44.727 --> 24:48.932
And we went on talking around our table, and all of a sudden I look up, and there's Dr. Williams over my shoulder.

24:48.952 --> 24:51.195
And he says, I'm Jack Williams.

24:52.436 --> 24:53.978
And he introduced himself to the three of us.

24:55.059 --> 25:00.185
And he said, Tom, could you call my secretary and make an appointment?

25:00.205 --> 25:01.687
I'd like to talk to you.

25:01.747 --> 25:03.850
I didn't know what was going on.

25:03.870 --> 25:10.077
And so later, talking to Cooper, he says that he pointed to me and said that

25:10.934 --> 25:15.240
Tom Adair, the one we've been telling you about.

25:15.507 --> 25:17.550
What was that conversation with Dr. Williams like?

25:17.851 --> 25:18.451
Describe it.

25:18.732 --> 25:19.153
Do you remember?

25:20.394 --> 25:21.396
Yeah, yeah.

25:21.416 --> 25:22.337
When you went to the office.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.038
Yes.

25:23.058 --> 25:29.989
Well, first of all, you're impressed by this gigantic office filled with nicely polished wood and furniture.

25:30.029 --> 25:34.215
So it was a gigantic office and beautiful conference table at one end.

25:35.217 --> 25:36.559
And, of course, he was very pleasant.

25:36.579 --> 25:38.202
And we chatted for a few minutes.

25:38.302 --> 25:44.451
And then he said, well, you know, Ed Cooper's going to go over to this.

25:44.431 --> 25:55.765
some people who recommended that you might be interested and so I want to talk to you and so you go back and see if you think about it and then let me know in a few days.

25:56.586 --> 26:13.746
And I think he even went into what the salary would be and something about what he would expect and I'm sure he said, I don't remember, he said probably told me to get with Cooper and talk to him about what the job was all about and so

26:14.671 --> 26:15.392
I did.

26:15.632 --> 26:20.619
I came back and Prescott didn't know why he'd call me up there.

26:20.639 --> 26:24.184
I'd told him before I went that I had to go up and see the president, so that made him curious.

26:24.965 --> 26:32.115
But by the time I left to go up there, Prescott knew because as I was leaving, he said, well, yeah, I know you go up there and talk to him and think about it.

26:32.675 --> 26:38.383
So I think he got on the phone to find out what's this young guy in my office going to go see the president about.

26:39.882 --> 26:48.976
Those type things bothered him, not as badly as they did the latest dean I've had over here, but they bothered him.

26:50.759 --> 26:58.331
And did, when you began, did Dr. Williams give you any rules, guidelines, advice?

26:58.791 --> 26:59.292
Not really.

26:59.272 --> 27:07.443
I went up, I had several weeks notice, and so I went up several times to visit with Cooper.

27:08.624 --> 27:14.872
And the only time I remember of those visits is Dr. Williams had a buzzer he'd push when he wanted Cooper to come in.

27:15.573 --> 27:18.998
And so I was sitting there chatting with Cooper one time and that buzzer.

27:19.959 --> 27:21.641
And so Cooper said, come on, come on, we're going in.

27:21.661 --> 27:23.203
So I wandered in with him.

27:23.223 --> 27:24.925
We sat there and chatted with him.

27:25.726 --> 27:29.211
And they were talking about a case, an incident at the library.

27:29.697 --> 27:30.439
A what?

27:30.459 --> 27:31.883
An incident at the library.

27:32.865 --> 27:40.565
And evidently this co-ed was sitting there reading and it was these carols that you face this way and then there was a face this way but there were these walls you couldn't see.

27:41.708 --> 27:46.120
And this somebody who was over there climbed under the desk in bitter tow.

27:49.019 --> 27:49.900
And then ran.

27:50.540 --> 27:55.165
And I'm sitting there listening to this conversation, wondering what I'm getting myself into.

27:59.589 --> 28:03.152
But anyhow, those were very, very pleasant years.

28:03.853 --> 28:07.557
And you were in the president's office how long?

28:07.577 --> 28:08.497
Two and a half years, I guess.

28:08.618 --> 28:16.545
I went up there September of 72, and I stepped down January of 75.

28:17.099 --> 28:24.488
Okay, and describe the office staff and the other people and what their roles were.

28:27.252 --> 28:30.156
I don't, there weren't very many.

28:30.276 --> 28:37.605
Nelda Rao was certainly the chief assistant, though she'd probably called secretary in those days, but she was assistant to the president and all.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.289
We have all ways of looking at it.

28:41.092 --> 28:45.205
And then of course Bob Cherry and I were the only ones up there.

28:45.225 --> 28:49.097
Describe Nelda and her, what she did and how she did it.

28:49.448 --> 28:52.453
Nelda was amazing.

28:52.834 --> 29:01.708
She's truly outstanding in running the office operation, and I was impressed by the whole operation.

29:03.130 --> 29:10.883
Mostly I was impressed by the fact she would never give Dr. Williams anything unless she had a copy of it.

29:10.863 --> 29:18.914
And I'm sure that was partly his request, because he lost a number of things, but she always had it.

29:18.934 --> 29:20.476
But she was very efficient.

29:20.856 --> 29:25.162
You couldn't ask for anybody better than Nelda to run that operation.

29:26.063 --> 29:28.847
Bob Cherry, of course, was just floating here, floating there.

29:28.927 --> 29:31.150
His responsibilities were the board.

29:31.130 --> 29:35.756
But I didn't notice any real problems between the two, Dr. Williams and Bob Cherry.

29:36.577 --> 29:42.083
As far as you recall, what was Bob Cherry's title?

29:42.103 --> 29:43.065
What was his official?

29:44.106 --> 29:46.509
Assistant to the President and Secretary to the Board of Regents.

29:46.529 --> 29:47.650
They're Board of Directors, I think.

29:47.690 --> 29:52.236
Of course, General Ludeke was there, too, while I was there.

29:52.516 --> 29:55.720
And he was Executive Vice President, which was a thorn in Dr. Williams' side.

29:56.155 --> 29:58.899
What did he, what were his, what was his role?

29:59.380 --> 30:00.381
His role was construction.

30:00.882 --> 30:01.603
Construction.

30:01.623 --> 30:02.144
Construction.

30:02.544 --> 30:05.909
And you say that it was Thorne and Dr. Williams' side and in what way?

30:06.510 --> 30:08.713
In that he didn't choose him to be that, in that position.

30:09.374 --> 30:12.419
And I think that set the stage for their relationship.

30:13.140 --> 30:15.323
Were there some times when they had disagreements?

30:15.503 --> 30:17.446
No, no, I've never seen anything like that.

30:17.486 --> 30:25.217
They probably did and might have, but my knowledge of it comes from Dr. Williams and he did

30:25.872 --> 30:36.725
complained that the board made that appointment and that was a condition on his being hired as president, is that his executive vice president was named by the board, General Ludeke.

30:37.406 --> 30:49.821
But I think General Ludeke oversaw a great deal of construction that was going on on campus in those days and really didn't get involved in any of the other aspects of the university.

30:49.801 --> 30:53.995
Describe General Ludeke's personality.

30:54.356 --> 30:55.519
Oh, I love the man.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.128
I had many conversations with him.

30:58.208 --> 31:01.920
My office and his office were pretty much side by side up there, so I

31:02.558 --> 31:05.322
I really enjoyed visiting with him in those days.

31:05.983 --> 31:08.727
Did he ever share with you any of his military experiences?

31:08.947 --> 31:14.635
No, we never really, or if we did, I don't remember him, but I didn't really.

31:14.655 --> 31:18.701
He always seemed to me to be very, very discreet about not passing.

31:18.721 --> 31:23.988
No, he never talked about anything, the AEC, any of those days, I didn't.

31:24.609 --> 31:29.055
And with those of us outside the office, Nelda was extremely discreet.
