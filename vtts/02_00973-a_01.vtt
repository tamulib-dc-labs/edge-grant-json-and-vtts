00:04.773 --> 00:18.226
This is an interview with Herbert L. Curry, 
Colonel, United States Marine Corps, by James W.

00:04.773 --> 00:18.226
Hodge, Jr., on 29 November 1988 at Texas A&M 
University, College Station, Texas, concerning

00:04.773 --> 00:18.226
the Vietnam War. In the interest of accumulating 
knowledge about the war, I'm going to donate this

00:18.866 --> 00:26.213
tape to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in 
the University Archives. Is that all right with

00:26.654 --> 00:27.574
you, sir? Yes, it is. Sir, could you start off with 
your date and place of birth? Yes, I was born in

00:35.013 --> 00:40.621
Colorado City, Texas, 26th of July, 1939. Sir, 
could you outline your education? Yes, I attended

00:46.208 --> 00:51.916
Texas A&M from 1957 to 1962. I graduated with a 
Bachelor of Science degree. Later, I attended the

00:55.761 --> 00:58.105
Naval Postgraduate School. It's the dates where I 
have a master's of science degree in management.

01:10.584 --> 01:12.767
Sir, how and why did you join the military? Not 
much. I know how, but I'm not sure why. Other than I

01:20.679 --> 01:30.754
was, as a cadet at Texas A&M, I was motivated to fly 
and go into the Air Force.

01:31.696 --> 01:35.321
I took my flight physical and found that my eyes 
weren't good enough to fly. I decided to join the

01:37.304 --> 01:40.529
Marine Corps. That was in September of 1959.

01:46.237 --> 02:00.218
Since there was not a naval ROTC program at Texas 
A&M, I had to use another route or path to get into

01:46.237 --> 02:00.218
the Marine Corps, and I was given a 10-liter 
flasher course that they had, which was another

01:46.237 --> 02:00.218
avenue for Actually, the only avenue at that time 
for people in Texas A&M was to join the Marine

02:00.721 --> 02:08.013
Corps. I knew others from

02:08.033 --> 02:11.999
OCS. So, did I tell you why and when? Yes, sir. That 
was pretty much the how. The how, okay. I don't know

02:18.089 --> 02:18.790
why. All right, sir. Could you have a brief sketch 
of your military career before Vietnam? Before

02:24.900 --> 02:26.543
Vietnam, I attended the basic school that all 
officers attend, that all Marine officers

02:27.738 --> 02:33.444
attend. I think the basic school is what makes the 
Marine Corps unique. This is a school where all

02:39.050 --> 02:45.157
officers attend. It gives you a basic training at a 
level above OCS. It's basic training in all

02:51.103 --> 02:55.568
aspects of the Marine Corps, infantry tactics, 
from firing artillery weapons and mortars to

02:56.172 --> 03:02.723
understanding about dispersing and supply and 
logistics. The beauty of the basic school is that

03:03.412 --> 03:08.098
when you leave there, everyone has a common 
background. You speak the same language and you

03:08.118 --> 03:12.144
can converse on any of the subjects. If you're an 
infantry officer and you need to talk to a tank

03:12.965 --> 03:21.416
officer or an artillery officer, you both share a 
common background, an educational background.

03:21.977 --> 03:28.045
You're the first people in the Marine Corps, and 
you can communicate with each other. It really

03:28.065 --> 03:29.166
facilitates getting the mission accomplished. 
After attending the basic school, I went to the 3rd

03:31.357 --> 03:38.884
Marine Division in Japan, actually Okinawa. And 
while I was there, I was a platoon commander in the

03:39.965 --> 03:51.976
reconnaissance battalion, and later on I became 
the executive officer of the company in that same

03:39.965 --> 03:51.976
battalion, and finally the S-4, or the logistics 
officer. And I would say that the S-4's job, or the

03:53.477 --> 03:59.102
logistics officer's job, It was probably one of 
the best learning times that I've had in my career.

04:07.135 --> 04:11.840
It was a staff officer's job to call up their 
captain when I was the first lieutenant. But I had

04:11.860 --> 04:17.687
to deal with so many aspects of running an 
organization and supporting an organization. It

04:17.707 --> 04:22.913
placed me in a position where I had to learn what 
made all the parts move. I would recommend that to

04:23.112 --> 04:25.415
anyone. Command is fun and great, but you need to 
know how to use your support staff. I learned what

04:30.863 --> 04:37.613
it was like to be a support officer and what I could 
provide to the line organizations. From Okinawa,

04:37.633 --> 04:46.386
I went to Camp Lejeune, where I became the 
executive officer of the company that reports

04:37.633 --> 04:46.386
logistics command. It was called Force Troops at 
that time. That's where we had all the heavy

04:50.400 --> 04:56.269
weapons at the support units to support a Marine 
division. At that time, we had a concept that the

04:56.289 --> 05:06.385
entire Marine division should be capable, or all 
elements of the Marine division should be capable

04:56.289 --> 05:06.385
of being lifted by a helicopter. So the tanks, the 
heavy engineering equipment, the amphibian

05:06.405 --> 05:14.938
assault vehicles came out of the division and went 
into Force Troops. I was the executive officer of

05:16.268 --> 05:25.785
the headquarters company for a year, and then 
after that I was the aide-de-camp to the

05:16.268 --> 05:25.785
commanding general for a year. That was another 
good experience, because working at the general

05:27.087 --> 05:36.724
officer level, I saw what factors went into making 
decisions at that level. We had the Dominican

05:37.092 --> 05:49.165
Republic crisis at that time where elements of the 
1st Marine Division, of course, groups there in

05:37.092 --> 05:49.165
Camp Lejeune went to the Dominican Republic for 
that crisis. Of course, we were supporting that as

05:50.406 --> 05:57.254
well as sending forces as well. When my assignment 
as aide to camp was completed, I had orders

06:01.055 --> 06:16.214
overseas to the Philippines with my family and 
went to a marine barracks where I was a guard

06:01.055 --> 06:16.214
officer for a period of time and then the executive 
officer in place. That was in 1964, 1965 and 1966.

06:25.760 --> 06:36.035
We were stationed at Sangley Point, which is on 
Manila Bay, about 45 minutes' road distance from

06:25.760 --> 06:36.035
Manila, and 45 minutes by barge across the bay from 
Manila. It was a small naval air station where we

06:36.055 --> 06:51.278
flooded support aircraft that were supporting 
the war effort in Vietnam throughout, as well as

06:36.055 --> 06:51.278
the Navy had the commander in his path for the 
entire Philippines up there. When I completed

06:52.186 --> 07:15.038
that tour in December of 67, I brought my family 
back to the States and then went to Camp Penland for

06:52.186 --> 07:15.038
three weeks of training for guerrilla warfare as 
well as jungle warfare before going over to

06:52.186 --> 07:15.038
Okinawa in January of 1960. I think I've left 
anything out that pretty well rounds out what I did

07:16.148 --> 07:22.015
prior to going to Vietnam. All right, sir. So could 
you talk about the date and place of tour in

07:22.556 --> 07:27.362
Vietnam, sir? Before doing that, I might mention 
that on my first assignment after basic school, I

07:28.563 --> 07:35.932
went to Vietnam. I was part of the 3rd 
Reconnaissance Battalion. About two weeks after

07:38.996 --> 07:44.603
I got to Okinawa, I boarded a ship with my platoon 
worked in conjunction with the underwater

07:46.355 --> 07:52.404
demolition team of the 7th Fleet at that time. And 
we might have spent three months in Vietnam. In

07:55.007 --> 08:07.065
fact, some three months aboard ship working in the 
coastal areas of Vietnam doing all the

07:55.007 --> 08:07.065
hydrographic surveys as well as the land surveys 
for amphibious assaults. And that happened from

08:08.166 --> 08:15.096
February to May of 1963. The second time into 
Vietnam, I started out as the operations officer

08:15.886 --> 08:31.442
of the Military Police Battalion for six months, 
and then I'd ask for a transfer to an infantry

08:15.886 --> 08:31.442
organization. I was able to go up to the 3rd Marine 
Division, assumed command of India Company, 3rd

08:31.462 --> 08:44.835
Battalion, 4th Marine.

08:44.855 --> 08:45.876
What was that question? Sir, the date and the place 
of tour. Okay. When I was the operations officer of

08:51.387 --> 09:01.738
the 3rd Military Police Battalion, we were 
assigned a combat sector in the Da Nang area. We

09:01.798 --> 09:13.551
were north of the Freedom Hill complex, as it was 
called, Freedom Hill being north of the Da Nang Air

09:01.798 --> 09:13.551
Base and the headquarters area for the 1st Marine 
Division. In a valley occupying the same area as an

09:14.442 --> 09:27.097
ARVN, that's

09:14.442 --> 09:27.097
Republic of the Vietnamese Army Command training 
base.

09:30.261 --> 09:36.668
I don't

09:30.261 --> 09:36.668
remember what that was called. But they had a small 
training facility in the same valley that we were

09:36.688 --> 09:40.413
located in. But we were the primary force in that 
area at that time. We operated – we were assigned to

09:46.066 --> 10:12.208
the southern defense sector around Da Nang, and we 
were responsible for the combat operations in

09:46.066 --> 10:12.208
that area as well as the military police functions 
in the Da Nang area, more commonly known as the rear

09:46.066 --> 10:12.208
area of the combat

09:46.066 --> 10:12.208
zone.

10:18.128 --> 10:32.307
Before moving up to the 3rd Division, I have to 
mention that the 3rd Military Police Battalion

10:18.128 --> 10:32.307
was actually a combat organization, more 
designed along infantry lines than the Army

10:18.128 --> 10:32.307
Military Police line. We did run the brig and the 
prisoner of war camp. We took everyone else and

10:38.210 --> 10:46.182
made infantry Marines out of them because we were 
responsible for defending Da Nang. And as a matter

10:46.802 --> 10:52.411
of fact, the North Vietnamese launched a large 
attack on Da Nang. They penetrated the 1st Marine

10:52.471 --> 11:00.302
Division's, I won't say lines, but their security 
zone and actually got into the the western corner

11:00.839 --> 11:07.990
of the air base where they met us and one infantry 
company that was assigned to us in that area. That

11:08.170 --> 11:10.594
was the big battle at the Cambly Bridge. After that 
I went up to the 3rd Marine Division. That was in

11:15.962 --> 11:20.709
August or September of 1968. At that time the 
division was located, the division headquarters

11:20.829 --> 11:27.319
was located in

11:35.348 --> 11:43.317
I'm having a mental lapse because I only spent one 
night there before going out to my command. Not in

11:43.337 --> 11:44.138
one tree.

11:51.406 --> 11:54.930
I'll pause and then get my map out. I'll

11:54.950 --> 12:04.140
stop that for just a second. All right, sir. Unless 
my locations and dates

12:09.132 --> 12:26.629
have me confused, when I flew in, the division 
headquarters was located at Don Ha, and then

12:09.132 --> 12:26.629
whenever I left, it was located at Quang Tri.

12:26.649 --> 12:32.694
That's way less correct.

12:32.714 --> 12:33.435
I'm pretty sure it was. I

12:34.630 --> 12:47.103
spent one night at Don Ha to draw my gear and then fly 
on out to my company. And to get there, I had to go

12:47.123 --> 13:04.401
through what was called LZ Stud, which was a 
helicopter base in the western part of the

12:47.123 --> 13:04.401
Northern I Corps up near the DMZ where we 
resupplied

13:06.119 --> 13:11.565
our infantry units, infantry and artillery 
units, as well as move the passengers in and out.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.348
That later became Vandergrift Combat Base. I flew 
into there, couldn't get a helicopter out for a

13:16.110 --> 13:32.667
couple of days, and then finally, when the weather 
was right, got a helicopter that was going out to

13:16.110 --> 13:32.667
the unit, and I was able to get out too. Thank you. 
What was the question? It was the place of tour,

13:36.578 --> 13:38.681
your rank. OK. I was a captain at that time. I'd been 
in the Marine Corps.

13:48.115 --> 13:56.406
I came in the Marine Corps in January of 62, and so 
this was September of 68. Believe

13:56.466 --> 14:04.037
it or not, I was probably one of the senior captains 
at that time. Because any time that a country goes

14:04.709 --> 14:15.363
to war, they take the permanent active duty people 
and they use them to expand the forces. And when you

14:16.584 --> 14:23.313
do that, you need more people at all levels and 
promotions are accelerated. I know as I was, when I

14:23.333 --> 14:30.042
was at Camp Finland, we were going through the 
three weeks training. Although I didn't view

14:30.308 --> 14:38.238
myself as a senior captain by old standards, I had 
two years in grade as a captain at that time. Some of

14:39.320 --> 14:50.013
the other company commanders or captains that 
were going through the training with me had as few

14:39.320 --> 14:50.013
as 22 months in the Marine Corps. They had made a 
second lieutenant in 12 months or less, first

14:50.033 --> 14:57.683
lieutenant and then captain. So when it came to an 
experience level of captains who were running the

14:58.135 --> 15:07.907
companies in Vietnam, it was rather short in many 
cases. So I was considered one of the senior

15:07.927 --> 15:11.171
captains at that time. By today's standards, 
though, that's really not the case. Captains have

15:13.213 --> 15:23.245
five, seven or so years of grade before they come

15:13.213 --> 15:23.245
up for major. I made major,

15:23.265 --> 15:27.130
well, Been a captain two years when I got my 
company. Maybe two and a half years. I was a company

15:35.199 --> 15:39.364
commander for that period of time. And then I made 
major in November of 69. So that gives you an idea of

15:43.109 --> 15:50.198
the accelerated promotions that we had at that 
time.

15:54.042 --> 15:54.502
All right, sir. In Vietnam, what job descriptions 
did you have? Well, as I said, the first six months,

15:59.307 --> 16:05.212
I was the operations officer of the 3rd Military 
Police Battalion.

16:07.874 --> 16:23.408
I orchestrated and controlled all the operations 
of that battalion, which included running the

16:07.874 --> 16:23.408
prisoner of war camp, the Marine Corps' military 
brig, the Northern I Corps, as well as the combat

16:07.874 --> 16:23.408
security operations. and that zoning defense, 
plus the military police actions in the way. And as

16:31.236 --> 16:36.704
a company commander of India Company 3-4, I was 
responsible for everything. That was strictly an

16:36.744 --> 16:41.170
infantry combat unit. I was out in the bush

16:41.190 --> 16:54.407
trying to locate, fix, and destroy the North 
Vietnamese that were in Northern I-4.

17:00.023 --> 17:23.635
concerning the military operations how did you 
and your unit try to fight the war

17:00.023 --> 17:23.635
well at that you have to understand the larger 
picture before you can put in perspective how my

17:00.023 --> 17:23.635
unit tried to fight the war we were far enough along 
in the war at that time where

17:28.340 --> 17:36.110
The Marine Division, or the units of the Marine 
Division, had the combat edge over the North

17:28.340 --> 17:36.110
Vietnamese. First of all, we got air superiority,

17:36.130 --> 17:44.361
which allowed us to fight a war of our choosing. In 
other words, the North Vietnamese, because they

17:46.563 --> 17:53.993
did not have air superiority or air parity with us, 
were not free to move during the daylight. They'd

17:58.046 --> 18:08.216
roll artillery pieces around or rockets because 
they'd be picked up by aerial observers and taken

17:58.046 --> 18:08.216
under fire. So theirs became a war at night, 
primarily, as far as movement and getting into

18:08.236 --> 18:18.867
position.

18:18.887 --> 18:24.233
Because we enjoyed that air superiority, we had 
the upper hand on the battlefield.

18:26.491 --> 18:55.013
Because it was a political war as well as a military 
war, we realized that if we were ever going to get

18:26.491 --> 18:55.013
out of there, we being the administration and the 
commanding generals, is that we would have to work

18:26.491 --> 18:55.013
with the Vietnamese forces, train them, and give 
them the wherewithal so that they could

18:26.491 --> 18:55.013
eventually stand up against the North Vietnamese 
army. And we were in the process of doing that. We

18:58.251 --> 19:04.920
realized that we couldn't control the entire 
countryside, in other words, blanket the mass of

18:58.251 --> 19:04.920
people. So we started working out of strategic 
positions, key points, key terrain points, where

19:04.940 --> 19:20.642
we could control that and use an approach, working 
with the Vietnamese so that they could stand on

19:04.940 --> 19:20.642
their own feet and take over. So ours was a war of 
movement. where each company would move roughly

19:24.271 --> 19:26.774
every three days. They would go into a position, 
patrol, defend there, try to locate and find the

19:26.794 --> 19:35.024
enemy and destroy them, and then move on. We stayed 
on the move. We were on the offensive the whole

19:37.306 --> 19:53.485
time, which kept him off balance because he 
couldn't go to a static position and defend there

19:37.306 --> 19:53.485
because once we found him, then we could bring in 
massive combat power, the artillery in the air,

19:37.306 --> 19:53.485
and not take him off. So our job as a company was 
scouting and patrolling on large-sized unit

19:54.275 --> 20:15.326
level, moving around covering large distances, 
hoping to find the North Vietnamese at which time

19:54.275 --> 20:15.326
they would be conferred actual forces on them. I'd 
say the worst part, the North Vietnamese were very

20:15.626 --> 20:21.114
good soldiers.

20:21.134 --> 20:22.476
They were not risk-takers. But if they located you 
and you didn't move, then they would conduct their

20:24.245 --> 20:36.265
reconnaissance, develop their plans and reverse 
them. And when they would attack, if you had been in

20:36.285 --> 20:43.657
that location very long, you knew that you were in 
serious trouble. Because they were very

20:43.677 --> 20:50.488
confident in their abilities, they had a good game 
plan, and they were prepared to take you out. And

20:51.818 --> 21:02.570
that's – that type of action as opposed to a meeting 
engagement where you accidentally run into

20:51.818 --> 21:02.570
people or unexpectedly run into an enemy force and 
you have to fight. There we were far superior to

21:02.930 --> 21:08.736
them because we could call in artillery, we could 
call in air. Without – except – well, with very few

21:11.219 --> 21:16.965
exceptions, we always came out the victor on those 
types of occasions. If you were placed on a hill for

21:17.485 --> 21:27.456
a certain length of time and left there by 
yourself, that's a company now of anywhere from 85

21:17.485 --> 21:27.456
to 180 people depending on the strength at that 
time.

21:30.299 --> 21:38.447
If it was an attack of his choosing, if you were in 
for a good battle, it would take a lot of capital.

21:38.467 --> 21:38.908
All right, sir. What are your training and 
experiences in combat?

21:45.582 --> 21:47.444
training prior to combat? MR. Yes, sir.

21:54.453 --> 22:04.966
Of course, the basic school teaches all the 
officers the infantry basics, but you can't stop

21:54.453 --> 22:04.966
there with the training. From there, I went on to 
the 3rd Reconciliations Battalion, which is an

22:04.986 --> 22:13.356
infantry organization, although it specializes 
in reconciliations. You also have an infantry

22:13.376 --> 22:15.218
nation. your

22:15.957 --> 22:28.654
daily

22:15.957 --> 22:28.654
role was to train the execution of that machine. So 
that was continuous training in anti-tactics.

22:29.656 --> 22:32.119
That was all the way up through first lieutenant. 
From there, when I went to force logistics

22:32.139 --> 22:36.345
command, that was staff work. where you learn what 
it takes to support, and that gives you a different

22:36.933 --> 22:41.721
view of operations. But that in itself is 
training, not infantry training, but it teaches

22:42.061 --> 22:50.194
you what to call for when you need support. Then 
when I went to the Philippines, although that was

22:50.214 --> 22:58.167
Guard duty, we had a training schedule, and we 
would go out into the countryside and conduct

22:50.214 --> 22:58.167
infantry training. Here I took great advantage of 
the enlisted Marines that I had who had been

23:01.942 --> 23:24.311
assigned there after Vietnam to draw their 
experience and techniques, to teach the others,

23:01.942 --> 23:24.311
the Marine parents, what it was like over there, 
what you could expect or anticipate, and those

23:01.942 --> 23:24.311
tricks of the trades necessary to survive in the 
combat environment. Sir, so that type of training

23:24.331 --> 23:28.096
was your own idea? That's correct. All right. You 
were in Pendleton three weeks before you went to

23:30.730 --> 23:34.034
Vietnam? Yes. And what training did you receive 
there? There was training there as well. That was

23:38.860 --> 23:42.784
jungle training and survival training. We had 
courses that we went through that taught you how to

23:42.804 --> 23:58.763
identify mines and booby traps, taught you how to 
be alert for trip wires or activation devices so

23:42.804 --> 23:58.763
that you could avoid those or stop them. Not only 
would you avoid them, but everyone else would be

23:59.350 --> 24:05.458
able to avoid those tripwires and explosive 
devices. We had infantry training, weapons

24:07.200 --> 24:10.504
training. We had conditioning hikes both day and 
night. We had a lot of training in nighttime. It was

24:16.472 --> 24:25.022
an intensive period, an intensive three-week 
period

24:16.472 --> 24:25.022
in camp before we boarded aircraft. Were the 
instructors there? The folks that had been in

24:29.050 --> 24:30.572
Vietnam? Yes, without exception. They were all 
combat veterans. And were the experiences you had

24:34.337 --> 24:43.128
during the training the same that you actually had 
in Vietnam when you were fighting? What was the

24:44.110 --> 24:46.292
school, did it adequately prepare you? I don't 
think anything adequately prepared you for

24:47.834 --> 24:53.742
combat other than combat.

24:58.025 --> 25:16.775
No, it

24:58.025 --> 25:16.775
didn't prepare me for combat, nor did it prepare 
the junior Marines for combat. That's not being

25:16.795 --> 25:21.583
critical of the school. I'm just saying that 
nothing can really prepare you for combat. It's a

25:22.885 --> 25:24.347
completely different environment than what 
you're accustomed to. For instance, you're out

25:24.367 --> 25:25.669
there in the middle of nowhere, of the Weather 
Rifle Company with no visible means of support. I

25:30.953 --> 25:34.577
only rode on trucks one time in six months. 
Wherever we went, we either had to walk or there was

25:34.597 --> 25:40.085
a helicopter. All food and water had to be sent by 
helicopter. When the weather was bad, we would

25:43.649 --> 25:53.462
have to send details down to the hills and the 
mountains, down to the spring bass at the bottom of

25:43.649 --> 25:53.462
the mountains and collect water. We learned that 
if we didn't eat all of our rations, we should bury

25:54.438 --> 26:05.794
them, because we might come back to that location 
and not be able to have it be resupplied by air. If

26:05.814 --> 26:14.246
that were the case, then we could dig up our old 
caches

26:05.814 --> 26:14.246
and re-stash them. Battles or firefights are 
short and intense in most cases. and no training to

26:21.522 --> 26:25.607
prepare you for that. If you have a meeting 
engagement, complete chaos breaks loose, and you

26:25.627 --> 26:39.362
hope that the training that you had before that, as 
well as the training that you conducted in the

26:25.627 --> 26:39.362
combat zone, mentally prepares you to react 
without thinking. And most, in all cases, it did, I

26:39.382 --> 26:44.007
guess. But to give you an example, an ambush is 
probably the most difficult situation in the

26:44.027 --> 26:49.673
ground response. You're in a killing zone, the 
enemy is standing waiting for you, and he springs

26:51.357 --> 26:59.024
the trap on you, so to speak. The only way to get out 
is to fight your way out. You can't hit the ground,

27:01.647 --> 27:04.750
because there's no protective cover there. They 
chose the site to have this. You've got to turn in

27:07.353 --> 27:12.718
the directions of the guns that are firing at you, 
and assault them. And that's got to be reflex

27:12.738 --> 27:20.065
action, because every second that you stay in that 
killing zone, it's more dangerous. We can train to

27:20.669 --> 27:26.088
do that and condition people to do it. But until 
they've actually been fired at in anger, we're not

27:26.109 --> 27:31.066
prepared. Yeah. In other words, it's a shock the 
first time it happens. Yes, the training that goes

27:35.438 --> 27:44.770
on beforehand, the peacetime training, the 
training that goes on just prior to going out into a

27:35.438 --> 27:44.770
combat zone, is mental conditioning. Teach 
Marines to instantly obey orders. If someone

27:48.475 --> 27:55.884
hollers, ambush right, most of the people would 
automatically face to the right and start firing.

27:55.904 --> 27:58.067
So, yes, that training was impactful. Not only is 
training prior to getting to a combat zone

27:58.587 --> 28:07.800
important, you've got to continue training when 
you get into a combat zone. You're not engaged in

28:07.820 --> 28:09.923
the enemy every day. You may go three weeks or two 
months without engaging. That was because of that

28:13.628 --> 28:15.310
type of war. But that's not uncommon in other wars 
either. When you're not engaged, you're out

28:19.516 --> 28:27.767
patrolling, you're in your defensive positions, 
you're firing your support weapons. That's

28:28.793 --> 28:32.679
training as well as actual operations. But for 
those people that aren't out conducting the

28:32.699 --> 28:42.333
patrol or ambulance, in the daytime, you need to be 
having classes for those people, practical and

28:32.699 --> 28:42.333
proficient. It's not like standing down to a 
no-sweat garrison environment back in the States

28:42.353 --> 28:52.568
because the threat's always there if you haven't 
maintained proper security. But as far as basic

28:52.588 --> 28:57.315
things like proper digging of a fighting hole, 
clearing fields of fire, proper scouting and

28:57.295 --> 29:07.746
patrolling techniques, setting up your fans of 
fire for your various weapons systems. That still

29:07.766 --> 29:08.907
takes training. You've got to remember that most 
of the Marines that went over there came right out

29:09.108 --> 29:25.966
of boot camp, and they haven't had the opportunity 
or did not have the opportunity to be in an infantry

29:09.108 --> 29:25.966
organization for a year or two years before they 
got there and learn all these skills and refine all

29:09.108 --> 29:25.966
these skills. They're just a basic movement 
together. So unless you want your unit to fight at

29:27.147 --> 29:41.441
its lowest combat denominator, that being the 
least trained person, you've got to continue with

29:27.147 --> 29:41.441
the training program in combat to improve those 
skills that they receive in boot camp and in the

29:27.147 --> 29:41.441
training school. And that just takes a conscious 
effort, because there's not a formal training

29:41.461 --> 29:47.127
program as we have it in peacetime. But each 
company commander needs to work out the program

29:47.147 --> 29:52.472
and do those types of things. All right. Sir, I need 
to change the table. OK.
