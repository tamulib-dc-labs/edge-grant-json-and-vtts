WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:07.162
And he was nice, very, very, very well up in Exxon.

00:07.723 --> 00:10.892
He and Vaughn had crossed paths somewhere along the line.

00:11.975 --> 00:13.579
So I was just talking to him about it.

00:13.599 --> 00:15.244
He said, listen, there's this guy Vaughn Bryant.

00:15.264 --> 00:18.192
He's the guy, maybe he's the guy.

00:18.560 --> 00:29.896
I contacted Vaughn, and we brought him here, and he went back to Washington State, and he didn't think he was going to accept it first.

00:31.018 --> 00:36.305
And I don't know what it was that turned things around, but anyway, he decided he would come here.

00:36.605 --> 00:44.837
But he, you know, I'm saying again, among the bright spots that I've had

00:45.290 --> 00:49.417
I'm talking about the bright people that I've been with, that really helped a whole lot in a way.

00:50.519 --> 00:59.374
And I think I gained by them being so damn good, you know, it wasn't me, Ty Tim and Vaughn Bryant.

00:59.394 --> 01:06.285
And he really took that program, he ran with it, and man, he is, but anyway, you know, he gave it up just recently.

01:06.265 --> 01:06.826
Really?

01:06.867 --> 01:07.689
Yes.

01:07.709 --> 01:13.965
Because I've told people that I remember when we only had one or two anthropology sections.

01:14.246 --> 01:14.667
That's right.

01:14.928 --> 01:16.191
Certainly not a major.

01:16.292 --> 01:17.074
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17.094 --> 01:19.280
And now it goes all the way through the Ph.D.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.242
Yeah, yeah.

01:20.383 --> 01:22.468
And he just doesn't try.

01:22.448 --> 01:29.156
And not all that, he's brought in Nautical, all this other stuff that's really big name stuff that a lot of us don't know about.

01:29.336 --> 01:36.124
When, as anthropology was getting that early start, who were your allies in helping it?

01:36.364 --> 01:41.350
Who deserves a pat on the back for... I guess Maxwell, really.

01:41.591 --> 01:42.852
Okay.

01:42.872 --> 01:45.435
I don't think, you know, we just...

01:46.951 --> 01:48.493
Maxwell was just great to us.

01:49.215 --> 01:55.885
And I don't know whether it's just the fact that we were over there as new guys, you know, new kids on the block, he was going to try to help us.

01:55.925 --> 01:58.269
But Maxwell was very, very good to us.

01:58.770 --> 02:11.490
Now I remember in- Chuck McCandless was his light hand man at that time, and Dan somebody was his money man, but we, everything, they were real good to us, just real good.

02:11.470 --> 02:24.488
I remember being, Calhoun and Winerti and I, in recruiting that nautical archaeology, we heard that it was up for grabs, and Vaughan was able to really put that all together.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.415
Any other bright spots that come to your mind like that?

02:32.559 --> 02:34.542
Well, I'm sure there are a lot of them.

02:35.028 --> 02:43.532
Well, when we revise it, if you think of them, can you think of any omissions where we missed an opportunity that now with clarity of hindsight we can spot?

02:48.727 --> 02:49.088
Well,

02:50.671 --> 02:54.638
It's kind of hard to find these, you know, without giving it some real good thought.

02:55.099 --> 02:56.822
I don't, I can't think of any.

02:56.842 --> 03:09.405
You know, yes, sure, it's been nice to advance more rapidly and all that, but given the conditions and everything, I think it's just going very, very well.

03:13.233 --> 03:27.698
I don't know if it's an omission or not, I'll just say it openly though, and that is that I don't know what happened, but while I was at the university, active, I felt like we were a team of people

03:28.673 --> 03:30.917
all-inclusive, everybody for everybody.

03:32.219 --> 03:38.931
And maybe it's just the young people that I talk to a lot, but I don't find many people very happy today.

03:39.852 --> 03:47.946
I'm not, you know, maybe we were, maybe there were people like that, but if they were unhappy in our day, they left.

03:49.369 --> 03:51.913
But I just, you know, it just seemed me like the

03:52.400 --> 03:57.685
how shall I say it, the feeling of loyalty to the university, et cetera.

03:58.526 --> 04:01.689
But that may be not just A&M.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.750
It's probably other schools.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.912
That may be nationwide.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.254
I fear you're correct.

04:08.215 --> 04:13.080
Because I left in 1980 to go to El Paso.

04:13.741 --> 04:18.866
And at that point, I felt we had a kind of a school spirit, a kind of a team feeling.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.027
That's right.

04:20.007 --> 04:23.495
I don't sense that being nearly as strong today.

04:23.515 --> 04:28.265
I wonder, though, to what degree this is true on other campuses.

04:28.365 --> 04:30.089
It's probably the same thing, I would guess.

04:30.450 --> 04:31.332
Yes, I think so.

04:32.414 --> 04:36.744
I think that now we have more people who are highly individualistic.

04:36.764 --> 04:37.746
Right, yes.

04:38.182 --> 04:42.651
and are less inclined to be team players.

04:43.513 --> 04:48.643
All right, let's kind of draw this to a conclusion.

04:49.805 --> 04:55.937
I ask you about your proudest moments.

04:55.917 --> 05:03.485
And how, if I'm not mistaken, these awards, you didn't even know you were going to win it.

05:04.066 --> 05:04.366
That's correct.

05:04.386 --> 05:12.295
How did you, where was that award presentation, and how did you feel when you... It was in Guide Hall.

05:12.315 --> 05:15.418
And I really didn't know.

05:17.040 --> 05:24.928
And I think I'm correct in saying that about all I got any indication was that...

05:27.541 --> 05:54.038
somebody a tie somebody says you know let's go over there you know that kind of stuff it you know but it wasn't i didn't know yeah uh i know really a proud moment i won one the first year i was eligible and i had told one of my buddies that i would kiss his fanny if i ever won one and he came up on the stage later and said he was ready for for me to keep my promise

05:54.473 --> 05:59.861
And there are other people that are more, you talk about highlights of my career, whatever.

06:00.422 --> 06:07.272
Another one of those was that when we hired Jerry Gaston as a department head at Texas A&M.

06:08.394 --> 06:12.199
Now there is, in my opinion, a top, top notch administrator.

06:12.219 --> 06:14.743
How did you all find him?

06:16.782 --> 06:20.669
Okay, let me go back and review a little bit of this again.

06:20.689 --> 06:27.882
I was one of the acting head with no particular time frame.

06:29.565 --> 06:41.406
And about the second year or so, third year, something like that, David Maxwell talked to all of our faculty, et cetera.

06:42.398 --> 06:55.525
And to my knowledge, there's basically one person who's quite key, was going named at the moment, who was in favor with people in the College of Agriculture.

06:57.490 --> 06:59.955
He wanted to keep rural societies separate.

07:01.498 --> 07:03.462
I was very much in favor of saying

07:03.779 --> 07:14.916
let's have a sociology program and let's have the sociology and rural sociology people housed together to be common mates and so on and so on.

07:14.936 --> 07:23.769
And anyway, the other end of that argument went to the other group anyway.

07:25.031 --> 07:28.116
So about that time,

07:30.020 --> 07:38.871
We had a discussion, I had a discussion with, Maxwell had a discussion with me, more or less, and said, you've done a good job, or I'm happy with everything, so and so on.

07:39.892 --> 07:43.977
And nice enough, whether he was being truthful or not, he said, as far as I'm concerned, I'd like to keep you.

07:44.758 --> 07:57.073
And yet there are one or two, he didn't name them, but I knew who they were, who felt like that they wanted somebody else.

07:57.408 --> 08:00.617
So they went out to, and so we were going to get a new department head.

08:01.019 --> 08:05.664
So we got Jim Kopp, and he was a rural sociologist, by the way.

08:06.985 --> 08:16.515
And then at the, I don't know at what point, Maxwell was still here, I think, yeah, we were going to have another review, whatever you want to call it.

08:17.717 --> 08:23.242
And apparently decided that maybe we would have another department head.

08:23.262 --> 08:27.567
And some of the key players in that really were.

08:30.314 --> 08:31.616
What the hell.

08:32.036 --> 08:37.804
He's now an associate dean in liberal arts, oh gosh, that I hired him.

08:37.884 --> 08:42.650
He got him from southern Illinois, Ben Crouch.

08:43.771 --> 08:50.039
And Ben had done his doctorate under Jerry at southern Illinois.

08:50.059 --> 08:58.650
And another factor was that Melvin Brooks, who was my advisor, key advisor here,

08:59.491 --> 09:06.033
He, in the meantime, didn't fit in too well here because he was one of these guys who would bring up questions, you know, and what sort of stuff.

09:06.053 --> 09:07.678
So he ended up in Southern Illinois.

09:08.975 --> 09:20.551
So I guess what really happened is that I called Melvin and said, hey, Melvin, you've got a guy over there that we're, you know, his name has come up.

09:20.771 --> 09:21.272
What do you think?

09:22.173 --> 09:25.217
And he said openly, he said, God, don't take that guy with him.

09:25.858 --> 09:26.479
He's something.

09:26.719 --> 09:30.344
And then I said, well okay, that's the guy that we're for.

09:30.484 --> 09:36.973
But anyway, the other group, some of them, they're always this side and this side.

09:36.953 --> 09:45.054
The other side seemed to try to come up with some reasons that maybe Jerry was not the guy for the job.

09:46.077 --> 09:53.275
And not to go into those, but particularly with Ben having been a student of his and all that,

09:54.453 --> 10:00.901
Ben could say in our faculty meetings that we had about this, hey, listen, this isn't true at all, you know, all that kind of stuff.

10:00.921 --> 10:02.703
Anyway, we got him here.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.748
And so he was just, I think, just tremendous.

10:07.589 --> 10:16.039
And I give him credit, really, for bringing the department to where it is today.

10:16.019 --> 10:18.343
And I also had to credit him with something else.

10:19.845 --> 10:26.476
When it came to the research award business, I had no idea that I was anywhere.

10:28.079 --> 10:34.369
And it may have had, I think it may have had something to do with I was going to be retiring in another couple of years anyhow, you know, all that sort of stuff.

10:35.191 --> 10:37.875
So he wrote one of the very nicest letters.

10:38.076 --> 10:41.942
Oh God.

10:41.922 --> 10:45.186
After all, people review those letters and anyway.

10:45.826 --> 10:47.809
But Jerry is another really highlight.

10:47.909 --> 10:54.276
That guy is terrific and I really think he ought to be the president of a university, tell you.

10:54.336 --> 11:00.723
But at the same time, Jerry is a very direct guy.

11:01.965 --> 11:09.313
One of my weaknesses that I had as department head is that somebody did something that was not really the best.

11:10.492 --> 11:35.181
And the dean would say to me, hey, you know, your guy over there is doing so and so, I was sort of in a position of trying to defend him, you know, say well, and I was not the kind of guy that could go to this guy and say, hey, you know, dadgum, with a few cuss words or whatever, dadgummit, you've done this and the dean is at me and by golly.

11:36.422 --> 11:40.347
Well Jerry is a direct guy and he talks to people very directly.

11:41.103 --> 11:49.111
And I guess that's his, as far as I can see, that's why he may not be a president.

11:49.852 --> 11:52.915
He did, Jerry did his undergraduate work at East Texas State by the way.

11:53.675 --> 11:54.196
I didn't know that.

11:54.216 --> 11:55.637
And then his doctorate at Yale.

11:55.657 --> 12:03.685
But anyway, I've always thought that Jerry would have fit, man, when that job came up at Commerce, he would have been the guy, but that's near the end of there.

12:04.526 --> 12:07.549
But I really, he's a, Jerry's a great guy.

12:08.221 --> 12:12.988
Very, very fine, straight shooter, but just outstanding.

12:13.028 --> 12:19.218
And he's the guy that really brought black people on our staff.

12:19.238 --> 12:26.749
And one or two of these are really very, very highly respected, you know, throughout the nation.

12:27.531 --> 12:30.415
And some of the other people, he's the guy that's responsible for bringing it.

12:32.707 --> 12:36.171
All right, we need to kind of bring this to a finish.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.994
I've got two very general questions.

12:40.236 --> 12:41.718
First one is hypothetical.

12:42.679 --> 12:59.018
What if someone came to you and handed you a check for a million dollars, and there was one condition on that million dollars, you had to pass it on to Texas A&M, but you could decide what it would be spent to do.

12:59.859 --> 13:02.342
What would you have them do with that million dollars?

13:06.423 --> 13:11.030
What would you most want A&M to do with something you would give them?

13:13.593 --> 13:14.615
I'd have to think about that.

13:14.755 --> 13:21.044
I think I would want those to go for scholarships, but specifically what kind, I don't know.

13:22.006 --> 13:23.668
And on what basis would they be awarded?

13:26.693 --> 13:33.763
On the basis of a general kind of like we did in

13:36.140 --> 13:49.294
When Dan Russell retired, we have one that says, in effect, we would like this award to go to a kid who is not the very brightest.

13:50.415 --> 13:56.281
He is not the very, you know, highly accomplished, but he's a hell of a good kid.

13:57.142 --> 14:02.148
He works hard, or she works hard, and they're good, solid people.

14:02.848 --> 14:04.510
I guess that's what I want to do.

14:05.924 --> 14:14.258
I know there are all kinds of awards for the people with the brains, but I would also like to see some awards just for the plain old kids that are struggling.

14:15.581 --> 14:16.643
Okay, the last question.

14:16.743 --> 14:19.648
What feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M today?

14:22.292 --> 14:30.126
I have feelings of all the finest things that one could say.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.744
I just think it's a great institution.

14:35.686 --> 14:41.994
I'm very happy that in all the things that have happened, I just, that somehow or another I came here.

14:42.014 --> 14:49.465
I just, I wanted to be the best.

14:52.589 --> 15:01.682
And I realized that against the University of Texas at Austin, we're always going to have to be probably second best.

15:02.118 --> 15:08.784
I want to say this, they're dang good at so many things, you know, and they've got so many things going for them.

15:08.804 --> 15:09.925
I guess I would put it this way.

15:12.388 --> 15:23.498
My feelings would be that I would wish that Texas A&M would be always looked upon as one of the top two in our state and, matter of fact, in the region.

15:24.419 --> 15:26.421
I guess that's what I'd vote for, really.

15:27.442 --> 15:28.763
And I really feel like it's there.

15:28.983 --> 15:31.045
Maybe I'm just biased in that way.

15:32.105 --> 15:32.953
Let's quit with that.
