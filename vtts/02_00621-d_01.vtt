00:00.031 --> 00:13.245
Well,

00:00.031 --> 00:13.245
Roger Revell came out to Pearl Harbor and he 
couldn't buy any shoes because he wore a 14 size and

00:00.031 --> 00:13.245
his toes were flapping out. Unfortunately, he got 
a case of cold one day and had to go to bed so I could

00:14.205 --> 00:19.211
get his shoes sewed up. And during those two hours 
while he was in bed and I was waiting for the shoes,

00:19.991 --> 00:24.997
he talked to me about oceanography. Were you in the 
Navy then? But actually, it goes much further back

00:27.925 --> 00:30.929
than that. My father's people are from the coast of 
St. Simons, Georgia. And I always wanted to get to

00:34.833 --> 00:39.018
the coast, with my mother being an artist like the 
mountains. So I was trying to get to the coast. And

00:41.881 --> 00:47.148
finally, when I went into the Navy as an enlisted 
man, I was thrown out for being colorblind. After a

00:47.948 --> 00:55.758
month in the dispensary, the chief showed me a 
manual of a thing called a bathy thermograph. He

00:55.898 --> 00:57.780
said, well, you know a little bit about sonar. Why 
don't you go up to Woods Hole? Maybe they'll give

00:59.468 --> 01:02.112
you a better job. August 23rd, 1941 was an awful hot 
day. The Atlantis was getting ready to go on a

01:06.357 --> 01:08.459
cruise. I sent my regards to the South Carolina 
Power Company and started in as a technician on

01:09.540 --> 01:18.271
Ewing's project up there. Then I went into the 
Navy, as the tape tells, as the BT tape tells, and

01:18.832 --> 01:27.582
rode herd on the Bath and Thermograph boys. all 
through Bikini. At the end of that time, probably

01:29.854 --> 01:43.028
really urged on by Roger Revelle and another talk 
I'd had with Ray Montgomery, I took the GI Bill of

01:29.854 --> 01:43.028
Rights and went to Scripps, and they let me in under 
the door. What was Maurice Ewing like? If you

01:48.894 --> 01:56.742
haven't read the November 4, 11, and 18 New Yorker 
of 1974 profiles, you have missed a gem of a

01:57.464 --> 02:05.093
description of the explosion of oceanography and 
the earth sciences largely due to this great

01:57.464 --> 02:05.093
genius. Morris Ewing was the most, he was a genius. 
One of the few I ever met. He could be as homely as an

02:13.442 --> 02:21.171
old shoe, tell you a joke right out of the Big Bend 
area or any part of Texas. But at the same time, when

02:22.513 --> 02:26.357
it came to knowing what he wanted to do, he had the 
gift. of making the right choice. I'll never

02:29.860 --> 02:30.961
forget a lesson. On an Atlantis cruise, we went 
across one of the canyons. I thought I'd noticed a

02:35.789 --> 02:40.517
change in the temperature structure. While I was 
sitting there thinking about it, of course, we

02:40.537 --> 02:45.264
were miles down the road. Ewing came to me and said, 
King, next time you get in an occasion like that,

02:46.126 --> 02:51.214
don't think Just take the data. Take more and more 
and more and more as fast as you can and figure it out

02:52.749 --> 02:57.494
afterwards. A lesson I never forgot. I once asked 
him, how do you know how to start a project? What is

03:04.822 --> 03:06.123
the most important thing? How do you pick it out? 
And he said, well, King, if the time ever comes when

03:08.306 --> 03:18.316
I think it's necessary to my project to count the 
rivets on the Atlantis deck, I'll count the rivets

03:08.306 --> 03:18.316
on the Atlantis deck. But therein lay his genius 
and that intuitive... choice of the main aim. And

03:24.431 --> 03:30.799
he never was looking just at the day, as you know, 
with the seismographs on the moon and all that. He

03:30.819 --> 03:33.262
was always way ahead of his time. And I think one of 
the most engaging things about him was his common

03:34.504 --> 03:43.095
real delight in the discoveries that were being 
made. It was my good fortune to spend one night

03:43.115 --> 03:48.842
there with him, Joe Warzel, John Ewing and his wife 
at Lamont's, at the house there, Ewing and Lamont.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.978
We just sat around and talked about things. And 
he'd say things like this. He said, well, I don't

04:00.960 --> 04:05.285
know if we want to change this or that. You know, 
we've got a ship now. And if something interesting

04:09.589 --> 04:14.234
is happening, we can send somebody there to look at 
it. Just the commonplace, common sense approach

04:14.254 --> 04:17.918
to everything that he did. He has, as the New York 
article brings out so well, he was fundamentally a

04:18.792 --> 04:28.224
teacher. That was his dream, that was his love. The 
story is told, perhaps part from the time he was, I

04:31.608 --> 04:38.076
believe, with, was it Lehigh? That someone said, 
you're flunking too many of your students. He

04:42.562 --> 04:47.668
said, well, suppose I could get an outstanding PhD 
for each year. for this university that I teach.

04:50.473 --> 04:51.795
Oh, that would be wonderful, they said. He said, 
all right. I'm going to talk then at the level of the

04:53.617 --> 04:57.323
best student I have in the class. And the rest of 
them, if you don't mind, I'll just throw the books

04:58.504 --> 05:05.415
down the stairs and grade them according to where 
they land. Of course, he wasn't that trash. But as a

05:08.038 --> 05:17.352
teacher, as a person able to explain a thing in 
simple terms, and that enthusiasm, they brought

05:08.038 --> 05:17.352
in the first from Africa, off the African coast, 
the first records. I was at Lamont one day when they

05:22.379 --> 05:26.024
came in by special courier. They spread them out on 
the table and John and Bruce, who they were very

05:27.126 --> 05:42.348
friendly at that time, and Ewing went bemused from 
record to record. Hazel would say, yes, I found it a

05:43.825 --> 05:48.411
thousand miles northeast of there, so here it is 
here again. And Ewing showed me his own sketch and

05:49.693 --> 06:06.776
plot of the distribution of manganese nodules 
from Panama to Hawaii as it came in from all the data

05:49.693 --> 06:06.776
that they had, and he'd already come to the 
conclusion of how they increased with distance

05:49.693 --> 06:06.776
and along that course.

06:07.898 --> 06:12.364
He was always overworked, always tired, but 
always... approachable. He'd come to

06:15.488 --> 06:17.911
Washington, didn't wear a hat. You'd see his hair 
above all the crowd, admirals and others on the

06:18.912 --> 06:23.357
streets in those days. He'd walk in with that calm 
smile, and he'd take us all to the Cosmos Club, and

06:24.338 --> 06:32.567
when the cupids on the ceiling began to dance, we 
knew we'd had enough to drink.

06:35.871 --> 06:38.373
Now, you were in Woods Hole? Yes, that's where I 
first met him. And he was, at that time, They had

06:42.955 --> 06:49.801
built about 15 bathy thermographs in the shop, and 
they were beginning to survey the... They had the

06:50.542 --> 06:55.247
idea of putting them on ships and surveying the 
waters of the North Atlantic. Then the war broke

06:55.267 --> 06:57.429
out right in the middle of that program. But he was 
already there in 1940, early 41. And

07:01.452 --> 07:09.520
there's a very, very important report of Woods 
Hole called... underwater sound in seawater that

07:10.664 --> 07:18.259
came out and reprinted in 42 that should be a part of 
this record. I once asked him where he got the basic

07:18.279 --> 07:23.008
sound velocity data calibrations. He showed me a 
Navy notebook in which there must have been 500

07:23.028 --> 07:29.761
handwritten calculations based on the 
temperatures that he'd found. And he said, here's

07:30.302 --> 07:32.807
where I established it. I was always trying to make 
him do something about sound velocity in the sea

07:33.378 --> 07:38.303
after those days. I said, when are you going to make 
it more precise? He said, when I find it in the

07:41.146 --> 07:45.650
affairs of my work. Of course, his development 
with Luskin, he was really head of the project, but

07:45.670 --> 07:55.860
Luskin did the work with the manufacturers. The 
precision depth recorder was a milestone in

07:56.701 --> 08:03.267
getting the precision of timing it to 1.2 million 
which was unheard of in those days, and took out the

08:03.584 --> 08:13.620
variability due to the swing of the ship's 
generator and the sound velocity, and therefore

08:03.584 --> 08:13.620
the distance measurements to the bottom. Did you 
stay at Woods Hole until 1945? No, I was at Woods

08:16.624 --> 08:25.238
Hole for eight months from 1943, August 1941, to 
February 1942, They gave me a wave on my eyes and

08:25.825 --> 08:31.133
took me back in the Navy as a junior grade 
lieutenant, the fastest promotion in history.

08:32.676 --> 08:34.639
And what were your duties in the Navy? During the 
first eight months at the Bureau of Ships, I rode

08:35.520 --> 08:45.937
herds on the manufacture of bathy thermographs 
with the big contractors like the Waterbury and

08:35.520 --> 08:45.937
the Submarine Signal Company. It was purely 
administrative work on contracts. And as I've

08:49.362 --> 08:52.407
said elsewhere, the important fact in this case is 
that the bathy thermograph was considered by the

08:52.775 --> 09:01.764
Navy a component of sonar equipment and therefore 
was never under the restriction of just

08:52.775 --> 09:01.764
scientific instruments. It was bought as a 
device. And that's the way Morris Ewing looked at

09:04.307 --> 09:06.389
it too. He did not look at it as a precision 
instrument. And all the money that's been spent on

09:09.572 --> 09:20.503
trying to make a bathy thermograph record 
accurately, quote unquote, has always amused me

09:09.572 --> 09:20.503
because what he wanted was a relative profile, the 
relative changes, those breaks in the trace which

09:20.838 --> 09:30.353
indicated where the things were, rather than the 
exact temperature at a given spot in time as you get

09:20.838 --> 09:30.353
with a reversion thermometer or something of that 
kind. Did you know Athelston Spellhouse? Yes, he

09:32.437 --> 09:42.773
was, I knew him later in Washington, and of course I 
was at his original Sea Grant dissertation up in

09:32.437 --> 09:42.773
Rhode Island when he launched that program. But I 
met him, and the bathy thermograph paper of

09:43.334 --> 09:48.162
Lafon's and mine are based on papers and stories I 
got from him personally.

09:56.511 --> 10:01.538
Was it your impression he ever approached the idea 
of the BT being an exact measuring device? No, I

10:02.059 --> 10:11.112
don't think so.

10:19.462 --> 10:25.608
When you were with the Bureau of Ships, what other 
contacts did you have there to guide your career

10:19.462 --> 10:25.608
later in life?

10:28.491 --> 10:32.135
Well, of course, when I went out to the Pacific, 
Roger Revelle was just coming in. In fact, I met him

10:32.195 --> 10:36.660
in Los Angeles for the first time when he was coming 
into Washington. His main interest was where he

10:36.800 --> 10:39.723
could get a hotel room. But he and Dick Fleming met 
me in Los Angeles. And then when he took over, as

10:42.546 --> 10:48.692
I've tried to describe on the other tape, It was 
perhaps one of the most important signal moves and

10:49.077 --> 10:56.665
fortunate coincidences in the history of 
oceanography.

11:00.670 --> 11:01.571
Okay. What I'm interested in very much in here now, 
knowing that when the moves were made to create the

11:01.591 --> 11:17.768
Office of ONR with the Bureau of Ships and the 
Hydrographic Office, how do you remember that

11:01.591 --> 11:17.768
role as Navy is going to be placed into 
oceanographic research?

11:20.903 --> 11:32.942
Well, I think it became, if you'll talk to Jim 
Wakelin on this, and Arthur Maxwell, and Gordon

11:20.903 --> 11:32.942
Lill, you will get the exact information. I think 
it came out of the fact that people like Wakelin,

11:34.304 --> 11:47.485
who were on duty in the Navy, realized that there 
should be an assistant secretary for R&D, and out

11:34.304 --> 11:47.485
of that whole impetus, came the Office of Naval 
Research. I have never read a history of its

11:49.668 --> 12:09.099
formation, but I do know how the money changed from 
the Bureau of Ships over to the ONR more and more and

11:49.668 --> 12:09.099
more as ONR grew in stature and could take over more 
and more of the basic research support.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.865
At the beginning of Bikini, as Roger went out to 
Bikini, He met me for one night between 11 o'clock

12:13.942 --> 12:18.228
and 5 the next morning at Pearl Harbor. I was going 
back in to sit on his defunct desk, and he urged that

12:19.189 --> 12:33.047
I get three contracts signed, one with Scripps, 
one with Woods Hole, and one with, I believe it was

12:19.189 --> 12:33.047
Lamont at that time. And the Bureau of Ships was 
still funding, doing the major funding of those

12:34.008 --> 12:39.555
that early. Now, ONR came on. about, what was it, 
46, 47? And from then on, everything gravitated.

12:47.569 --> 12:50.974
The Bureau, of course, was really a little out of 
its field. More has been hung on the necessity for

12:52.036 --> 12:59.527
knowing about the ocean for sonar than any other 
reason that you can think of. And it was Roger's own

13:00.568 --> 13:04.975
task description that... lasted for about 15 
years, about seven sentences, that created the

13:05.478 --> 13:14.391
basis for the funding of a great deal of 
oceanographic work in the Navy. Now, but you went

13:15.552 --> 13:19.037
out to Bikini with Rebell, didn't you? He caught 
me. I got on a tanker and had gone down to Bikini and

13:20.419 --> 13:24.245
had just gotten there. I was halfway down there 
when the captain called me and said, what have you

13:24.265 --> 13:29.933
done, run off with some money or something? I said, 
no, they said they want you to go back to Washington

13:30.470 --> 13:33.755
immediately. So I saw Bikini from the air as they 
sent me back by seaplane to Pearl Harbor. I never

13:38.962 --> 13:40.304
set foot on it. You didn't see the explosion of the 
devices themselves? No, I missed all the big... I

13:43.829 --> 13:52.441
blamed somebody for that, and I looked for that 
jerk for ten years, and finally I found a letter I

13:43.829 --> 13:52.441
had written saying I'd sit anywhere they wanted 
me. Okay, when you come back then, your next job is

13:52.461 --> 13:59.551
administrative in terms of, I thought, the 
hydrographic office. Is that wrong?

14:04.169 --> 14:14.179
In the fall of 1946, I went out to Scripps in advance 
because I was really not out of the Navy until

14:04.169 --> 14:14.179
November. And thanks to Walter Monk coaching me on 
the math and the help of the other students out

14:15.481 --> 14:28.354
there, I was able to get a master's degree under the 
GI Bill of Rights, graduating in 1948. John

14:29.347 --> 14:36.758
Cochran and I got our degrees along with Woody 
Jacobs getting his doctorate up at UCLA that hot

14:29.347 --> 14:36.758
June day. I went in in July and Dick Fleming gave me a 
job at the Hydrographic Office for the first two or

14:37.839 --> 14:45.250
three years. I can never remember offhand whether 
I left the, I think I left it on January the 2nd,

14:45.670 --> 14:50.918
1951. At the Hydrographic Office, I was in charge 
of oceanic development and had a part in the

14:59.047 --> 15:18.345
developing of the instrumentation for the two 
first seagoing vessels as oceanographic

14:59.047 --> 15:18.345
vessels, the San Pablo and the Rehoboth, vessels 
which Tommy Austin took to sea and did so well with

14:59.047 --> 15:18.345
in establishing the traditions and beginning of 
the oceanographic cruises of which there have

14:59.047 --> 15:18.345
been so many since. I didn't fit in too well at the 
Hydrographic Office. I was more used to the Bureau

15:23.230 --> 15:27.754
of Ships, and when I was able to get a job over there, 
I transferred. And they put me in charge of these

15:28.156 --> 15:38.410
same contracts that had been running with the 
Bureau since the war days under Dick Williams and

15:28.156 --> 15:38.410
George Cummings. George Cummings, 
incidentally, lives in Port Charlotte. And you

15:43.256 --> 15:49.445
should get in touch with him as he was Ross and 
Bennett's number two assistant and can give you

15:43.256 --> 15:49.445
much of the administrative information you wish. 
He's still alive. What did you not like about the

15:52.349 --> 15:54.291
Hydrographic Office?

15:57.055 --> 15:57.876
Why? I'd rather not go into that. It was about that 
time I fell in love with a gallon. It didn't turn out

16:04.230 --> 16:07.734
too well, so there were several things of that 
kind. I don't blame anybody.

16:11.979 --> 16:13.861
And how long did you stay with the Bureau of Ships? 
From 1952, 51 if that's the date, until January 10,

16:14.261 --> 16:19.628
1972. And did you see any sizable change in the 
direction of the Bureau of Ships those 20 years?

16:30.408 --> 16:30.929
Oh, yes. Immediately after the war, when I came 
back there on the McKinney, this, as described in

16:32.371 --> 16:40.983
the manual there, this great organization had 
been cut down. So far cut down, George Cummings and

16:42.886 --> 16:57.006
one lieutenant commander sat in a room at the end of 
a long corridor along which there were about 10

16:42.886 --> 16:57.006
desks, and there was just one man left of each of the 
division's An important group of that was the

16:57.560 --> 17:01.165
sonar analysis group. And Frank Andres, whose 
name I've given you and address I've given you, can

17:01.185 --> 17:07.753
give you the background on that. John Coleman of 
the Academy at one time was head of that group

17:07.833 --> 17:13.701
during the war. And they played an important part 
in their requirements for information, which was

17:13.721 --> 17:22.292
oceanographically oriented. The whole thing 
always was the bureau ships was a hardware outfit.

17:28.458 --> 17:38.467
And it was quite difficult often to make far-out 
research without an absolute piece of hardware at

17:28.458 --> 17:38.467
the end of it go. But people were generous and they 
were, by using the government, my one good thing, I

17:38.487 --> 17:56.524
think, was that I did use the government 
laboratories to the maximum in establishing good

17:38.487 --> 17:56.524
oceanographic programs in them in addition to the 
university laboratories, and there's always

17:58.276 --> 18:01.481
competition. ONR went the university route they 
should, but it was my great, well, the program was a

18:01.642 --> 18:13.862
success, was to get oceanography into about eight 
government laboratories. Did you feel as if that,

18:14.924 --> 18:20.233
possibly after World War II, that the agency with 
ONR and NSL and with bureauships and hydrographic

18:21.074 --> 18:28.365
office diversified oceanographic research too 
much?

18:31.369 --> 18:40.863
Well, since I got most of my money from ONR into the 
Bureau, I always thought ONR was the daddy and the

18:31.369 --> 18:40.863
correct one. I thought that there may have been

18:46.640 --> 18:59.559
The most interesting thing, a division which even 
comes to this day, as I understand it, due to this

18:46.640 --> 18:59.559
poor Pascagoula move, or whatever you call it, the 
Hydrographic Office resisted greatly anything

18:46.640 --> 18:59.559
known as research. They were used to cutting and 
tried, proven by the Maury approach, or the

19:01.161 --> 19:15.702
practical approach, and although we fought to get 
the control for our own government laboratories

19:01.161 --> 19:15.702
of two oceanographic ships, it was a long time 
before we could do it. the Navy felt that the Navy

19:16.492 --> 19:26.184
Hydrographic Office, as a long-term function of 
CNO, was the proper place for the operation of

19:16.492 --> 19:26.184
those ships. So you have the dichotomy of survey 
and research. Where does one begin and the other

19:31.531 --> 19:33.033
end? Where does data gathering for understanding 
and then data gathering for a hypothesis, where do

19:34.255 --> 19:44.828
they merge? I won't say friction, but there was 
stress between the Hydrographic Office's aims in

19:45.398 --> 19:53.308
some areas and the Office of Naval Research as I saw 
them.

19:56.732 --> 20:01.618
Do you believe in the concept of directed research 
or pure research? In other words, what role do you

20:03.120 --> 20:07.105
see a research agent attached to the Navy? Should 
the Navy have more specialized or

20:07.586 --> 20:11.170
mission-oriented research? Of course, from a 
funding point of view, the wonderful old thing

20:13.546 --> 20:36.310
that used to be the theory, I say in that tape that is 
in the contracts, I'm not sure it was ever written

20:13.546 --> 20:36.310
in the contract as I think about it, but there was 
this idea in the bureauships when a thing had to be

20:13.546 --> 20:36.310
procured and you had to design it, you could go as 
far back in the theory as necessary to make a good

20:13.546 --> 20:36.310
design. And this meant eventually basic 
research.

20:42.637 --> 20:42.777
Uh-huh. The Office of Naval Research is the place 
for the main aim of basic research in the Navy on

20:43.010 --> 20:54.525
problems specified of what they see as 
Navy-oriented needs. I always liked in my program

20:56.047 --> 21:10.225
to have a leeway of 20 or 30 percent on the man who was 
getting the information for the hardware to do

20:56.047 --> 21:10.225
basic research in addition to just the applied 
part. And I got some pretty good ones. Eric Baldwin

21:11.587 --> 21:12.308
and was the first man to see the scattering layer 
and understand what it was like. This ability to

21:17.721 --> 21:31.136
look over the fence a little bit rather than at the 
directed aim, I don't think you can keep people

21:17.721 --> 21:31.136
turned on if you give them an assigned job. In other 
words, you think that much of the important

21:32.497 --> 21:38.464
research comes almost accidentally in the sense 
of the discoveries? Like, for example, the deep

21:39.645 --> 21:41.367
scattering layer.

21:44.570 --> 22:08.553
Well,

21:44.570 --> 22:08.553
about

21:44.570 --> 22:08.553
basic research versus directed research.

22:08.573 --> 22:13.378
Directed research has its place, particularly 
where you have a deadline and design. and a cash

22:13.882 --> 22:16.405
budget that you have to meet.

22:19.269 --> 22:27.300
But there should be something more in so-called 
undirected research than just data gathering.

22:27.320 --> 22:35.811
There should be the idea that you can get the theory 
better and you have some freedom of thought. There

22:35.831 --> 22:37.052
are two kinds of research. There's a commercial 
research in which you never risk a nickel unless

22:37.152 --> 22:42.960
you can see a six-cent prop. This is, of course, the 
background that the Bureau of Ships used to act on

22:43.396 --> 22:55.333
and did act on to a large extent. And the industry 
has to do that, too, because they have to make a

22:55.353 --> 23:00.140
profit or they don't do anything. But the 
undirected basic research is like water coming up

23:01.763 --> 23:05.949
on a marsh. It runs in all directions through the 
channels, but suddenly the whole level of the

23:07.210 --> 23:12.458
water is two feet higher. And that's the only way I 
can picture it. I do not think you can direct basic

23:17.644 --> 23:23.093
research.

23:24.756 --> 23:33.271
How much dealing did you have with private 
enterprise while you were serving off and on as a

23:24.756 --> 23:33.271
civil servant with the military?

23:33.291 --> 23:38.260
Well, of course, in the beginning, the 
bureauships had all the funding of the

23:33.291 --> 23:38.260
institutional work. And that great institution, 
the Marine Physical Laboratory, was established

23:40.619 --> 23:49.347
by the Bureau of Ships to bridge this thing that 
you're talking about right here. Admiral

23:50.028 --> 23:52.070
Cochrane did a remarkable thing. He said, we can't 
tell you how much we're going to give you, but we're

23:52.090 --> 23:56.494
going to give you some of our budget each year. That 
was the first time that this had ever been done by

23:56.534 --> 23:59.797
the Navy, as I understand. And he said, we will 
have, and as a result, they had three California

24:00.958 --> 24:07.504
professors independently of this whole project, 
paid by the University of California with status

24:08.142 --> 24:13.249
and everything else, tenure in the whole 
business. Carl Eckert was the first director,

24:14.350 --> 24:17.535
Leonard Lieberman and Russell Raitt. And they had 
a direct feed-in to the technician type of people,

24:18.456 --> 24:32.935
the applied people, who could then take that, put 
it into an instrument, improve an underwater

24:18.456 --> 24:32.935
sound bomb, or make a thing of that kind. and a 
better hydrofoam or better transducer because

24:33.252 --> 24:48.011
they had this feed-in of the best mines which were 
untrammeled by the necessity of meeting a

24:33.252 --> 24:48.011
deadline or being directed. And when that was 
taken away from the Bureau as being too basic, it

24:48.031 --> 25:02.770
just put one layer of administration before we 
could get the dope out of MPL into the Bureau

24:48.031 --> 25:02.770
because it had to go through and off.

25:08.707 --> 25:20.801
Did you seem to think that the relationship 
between private enterprise and the military and

25:08.707 --> 25:20.801
the universities functioned reasonably well 
without a great deal of bureaucracy while you were

25:08.707 --> 25:20.801
at the Bureau of Ships? It didn't function without 
a great deal of bureaucracy. Just look at your

25:22.883 --> 25:25.006
coordinating committees. No. Yes, I think toward 
the end and in the last, in the 60s, certainly in the

25:27.849 --> 25:37.600
60s, industry began to ride it. for all it was 
worth. And I think we got a lot of beautifully

25:38.882 --> 25:49.705
written proposals without necessarily the full 
expected output. But I can't say that, really.
