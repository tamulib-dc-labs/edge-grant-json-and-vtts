WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:08.155
...African agricultural research capabilities 
was National Academy of Sciences.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.005
I spent about six weeks on that trip. And

00:14.426 --> 00:17.771
then... In 1974.

00:22.499 --> 00:24.142
Prior to that actually. That's when that was 
published.

00:29.140 --> 00:54.085
And then I

00:29.140 --> 00:54.085
spent some time in Pakistan for the World Bank on 
this one. Which is the same sort of deal in

00:55.145 --> 00:58.250
principle as that. I

00:58.731 --> 01:02.597
see. Livestock production and marketing in 
Pakistan.

01:08.707 --> 01:12.633
I spent a month over there with two other fellows 
working on that project.

01:15.598 --> 01:20.967
West Pakistan.

01:21.740 --> 01:27.787
And you wrote Evaluation of Livestock Health 
Practices in Pakistan, I see. So it's a combined

01:27.807 --> 01:29.249
effort here. That's right. I visited all their 
research labs, trying to help them with these

01:29.870 --> 01:35.837
projects. And you took your knowledge to them. Did 
they have some of the same problems? Yes, they had

01:42.825 --> 01:45.949
problems with African horse sickness. I also 
spent, while I was in the Army actually, Before I

01:51.710 --> 02:07.159
left the Army, I spent a good many months in many 
countries of Africa and Asia on African horse

01:51.710 --> 02:07.159
sickness because it was a national threat to this 
country, you see. And the Army sent me over there

02:07.179 --> 02:14.713
from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.

02:16.870 --> 02:34.955
Well in Africa and in Turkey and Iran and 
Afghanistan and Pakistan and India, all those

02:16.870 --> 02:34.955
places on African horse sickness and wrote 
numerous papers about it that are listed there.

02:36.797 --> 02:46.270
Now when you went to some of these governments, all 
of these governments that you went to in the 1960s

02:36.797 --> 02:46.270
were so-called West-oriented governments. Did 
the State Department give you any, did they tell

02:46.688 --> 02:57.000
you or did any officials from the United States 
government tell you about what the Communists or

02:46.688 --> 02:57.000
what the Soviets were attempting to do? No,

02:59.823 --> 03:07.692
I had security clearances, of course, during that 
time. Sure, because of your dealings with the

03:08.653 --> 03:14.620
Army, your career with the Army.

03:16.422 --> 03:42.362
The only time I

03:16.422 --> 03:42.362
had to be careful from

03:16.422 --> 03:42.362
a Russian point of view was in taking photographs 
in Iran and Turkey,

03:16.422 --> 03:42.362
at which time

03:16.422 --> 03:42.362
there was some Russian participation in highway 
development in those countries and some things of

03:42.646 --> 03:48.895
that sort. But I never went to any 
communist-dominated countries at that time.

03:57.828 --> 04:02.435
Were you ever briefed by the CIA when you came back 
from these trips? Yes. Yeah, that was done.

04:08.244 --> 04:11.168
They basically wanted to know about the food 
production? interior of the nation? Yeah, that's

04:13.820 --> 04:15.021
right. They were concerned about- Just general 
intelligence? General intelligence.

04:27.512 --> 04:39.123
But I'd rather really not talk about that aspect of 
it much because I did have some relations with the

04:27.512 --> 04:39.123
CIA at that time. Now, I was also wondering about 
something that you said. And that is that drug

04:42.181 --> 04:48.408
manufacturing companies supplied money for 
this. Yes, they did for- Which companies? Well,

04:52.073 --> 04:55.216
I'd have to look it up to be sure now. But what they 
did was simply that they had some drugs which they

04:55.336 --> 05:05.669
wanted to evaluate for their therapeutic effect 
against these diseases we were working on. And

05:07.050 --> 05:12.036
this we did and reported back to them and were 
compensated for the work. And so basically, did

05:13.619 --> 05:18.244
they give you about a third of the funding, or less? 
No, it wasn't that way. It was a relatively minor

05:19.265 --> 05:25.391
amount, a few thousand dollars a year. But during 
our 12-year program, we had received between, I'd

05:25.471 --> 05:37.483
say, between $5 and $6 million from Rockefeller in 
aid for the program. And that, from commercial

05:37.503 --> 05:41.247
sources, was only a few thousand. Just nothing, 
yeah. Okay. Well, I'd like to talk now about the

05:45.285 --> 05:52.414
relationship that you had with the state of Texas.

05:59.083 --> 06:09.336
I'm trying

05:59.083 --> 06:09.336
to think of the name of the fellow that was in charge 
at the time. He was a veterinarian and the name of

06:12.715 --> 06:13.936
the board.

06:27.229 --> 06:40.461
Well, at any rate, the veterinary group employed 
by the state of Texas, state veterinarians,

06:27.229 --> 06:40.461
do have a keen interest in health of livestock in 
Texas. So they're much concerned about any group

06:41.200 --> 06:51.836
which is contributing toward improving health of 
Texas cattle and increasing opportunities for

06:41.200 --> 06:51.836
Texas livestock to be exported. They're also very 
much concerned about foreign diseases which are a

06:51.877 --> 06:59.388
threat to Texas livestock.

07:01.752 --> 07:08.322
And it's the Texas Animal Health Commission that I 
was trying to think about here. They were greatly

07:08.774 --> 07:20.349
concerned and involved us considerably when 
Benzoylan equine encephalomyelitis came into

07:08.774 --> 07:20.349
southern Texas in 1971 and 72. And because I'd had 
experience with that disease in terms of

07:20.409 --> 07:38.393
manufacturing vaccine at Walter Reed and

07:20.409 --> 07:38.393
some other exposure prior to that, I became very 
much involved in that threat to the United States

07:38.896 --> 07:43.301
when the disease moved from Mexico into Texas. And 
so I met several times at that time with a group of

07:45.003 --> 08:01.401
state veterinarians, the Animal Health 
Commission, and worked closely with them for

07:45.003 --> 08:01.401
several months on this equine encephalomyelitis 
problem that we had here. Well, what happened?

08:04.625 --> 08:06.827
Well, there was Quite a few thousand Texas horses 
lost because of that disease in 71 and 72. But

08:17.149 --> 08:37.219
fortunately, the vaccine we had developed in the 
late 40s and 50s at Walter Reed was subsequently

08:17.149 --> 08:37.219
produced by some manufacturing biologic houses 
in the United States, which made it available for

08:37.638 --> 08:45.407
for the vaccination of Texas horses and for those 
in many states across the southern half of the

08:37.638 --> 08:45.407
United States. So those vaccines that had been 
developed years before were effective in

08:45.447 --> 08:57.760
stopping the outbreak in the United States and 
kept it from sweeping the country. So that work we

08:57.780 --> 09:05.569
had done earlier was what really saved the horse 
industry in this country. Now let's switch to the

09:07.372 --> 09:14.043
relations that you had with the administration at 
A&M. Can you sort of trace that from when you came

09:14.123 --> 09:17.428
here at Dean Price? Yes. Dean Price was interested 
in the potential of a program in tropical

09:19.792 --> 09:34.054
veterinary medicine, and so he worked well with us 
in helping get things planned and organized. And

09:35.198 --> 09:53.584
then he and I met with President Rutter, who was 
also sold upon the potential of improved disease

09:35.198 --> 09:53.584
control, which would not only have worldwide 
benefits in terms of food supply, but also

09:35.198 --> 09:53.584
increase the market for Texas agriculture and 
Texas livestock. And so we were then, with

09:56.028 --> 10:04.159
Rutter's blessings, free to go out and seek funds 
and develop the program, which we did. We worked

10:05.168 --> 10:10.215
along very well that way for a 10-year, 11-year 
period.

10:14.641 --> 10:26.979
After that, there were changes in the 
administration

10:14.641 --> 10:26.979
so that the Tagus Agricultural Experiment 
Station became involved.

10:32.326 --> 10:33.488
Why did they become involved? I don't really know 
why they became involved, but they did. And

10:40.190 --> 10:59.290
when Dr. Trevino took over and when I left in 76,

10:40.190 --> 10:59.290
he was not permitted to go out and seek funds on his 
own, which were available. That's at the time when

11:03.169 --> 11:28.821
there was some ten million dollars available from 
Nigeria and substantial funds available from

11:03.169 --> 11:28.821
Latin America to

11:03.169 --> 11:28.821
foster the program and to improve opportunities 
for export of Texas cattle as well as improve the

11:03.169 --> 11:28.821
health of animals in the regions that wanted to 
provide support.

11:30.995 --> 11:38.142
And the administration would not permit 
acceptance of the programs or the acceptance of

11:30.995 --> 11:38.142
the funds. Why not? I don't know. I don't really 
know except that there was apparently some

11:43.867 --> 11:55.679
personal conflicts between Trujillo and some 
higher level administration people.

11:55.759 --> 11:56.860
In the president's office? No, it was the 
experiment station. But you weren't directly

12:00.509 --> 12:02.952
under the Experiment Station. No. I mean the 
Institute wasn't under the Experiment Station.

12:05.735 --> 12:07.757
No, it was under the College of Veterinary 
Medicine. But it was because of that barrier there

12:10.060 --> 12:27.620
that projects were not moved up to the 
International Programs Office where they would

12:10.060 --> 12:27.620
have okayed them and where we could have gotten on 
with the, the Institute could have gotten on with

12:10.060 --> 12:27.620
the programs.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.402
But because of that impossible hurdle. The 
institute practically died on the vine out there,

12:34.447 --> 12:38.031
and that's been the trouble. Well, what happened 
to Shelton? I mean, why didn't the dean? Because

12:42.476 --> 12:55.812
the experiment station, to the best of my 
knowledge, was providing some funds for the vet

12:42.476 --> 12:55.812
school that might have been cut off if he hadn't 
played ball with them.

12:58.222 --> 12:59.884
This is pretty ticklish. I don't really like to 
talk about it. And so now what's the status of the

13:02.849 --> 13:05.152
institute? Well, it's getting minimal support 
through the vet school.

13:12.843 --> 13:15.107
Very, very little in the way of outside funds. 
Who's getting the outside funds then? There isn't

13:20.474 --> 13:25.782
any for this work coming from outside, to my 
knowledge. Even though, in other words, some

13:27.128 --> 13:32.416
other university, college of medicine might be 
getting it. Hell yes. There's outside funds going

13:33.878 --> 13:38.104
to Illinois, to Florida, and Washington State 
that I know about. In sizable quantity. And the

13:43.451 --> 13:52.704
U.S. Department of Agriculture is now spending a 
million and a half dollars a year in Washington

13:43.451 --> 13:52.704
State that was originally intended to come here, 
but not accepted. No kidding. It's a damn tragedy.

13:56.249 --> 13:56.730
It really is. And part of our staff, Dr. Cutler and 
two other people that were on the staff here are now

13:59.427 --> 14:19.916
running the program in Washington State that they 
would like to be carrying on here and getting

13:59.427 --> 14:19.916
excellent USDA support.

14:19.936 --> 14:21.899
So it's unfortunate. I just don't understand why. 
I know I might be belaboring the point, but I just

14:26.123 --> 14:35.879
don't understand why we would not accept that type 
of money that seems so, and especially when we're

14:26.123 --> 14:35.879
the first institute in the entire country. It 
makes no sense to me whatsoever. It's a tragedy.

14:40.426 --> 14:44.653
And I think it's purely a personal matter, the one 
individual that's standing in the way.

14:49.641 --> 14:50.663
And I'm in hopes that I've had some talks with 
Vanderveer, not about this specific problem, but

14:52.178 --> 15:01.112
about his interest in world food problems. And 
he's appointed me to the committee to participate

15:01.472 --> 15:12.229
with the large seminar he wants to have held here in 
84 on world food problem. I'm in hopes that he will

15:13.651 --> 15:21.122
have a different attitude and can take that 
barrier out of pipeline that we've got in now so

15:21.507 --> 15:42.705
that this thing can function again because 
there's tremendous need for what can be done and

15:21.507 --> 15:42.705
people here eager to do it there are there about 
four faculty members out here now that are

15:21.507 --> 15:42.705
formerly with the program that would be eager to 
work in this area they spent time overseas with us

15:21.507 --> 15:42.705
and or know the importance of it and be glad to do 
research in this area if they were simply

15:43.529 --> 15:55.284
permitted to do it in terms of getting funding

15:43.529 --> 15:55.284
and so on. I don't understand exactly why anyone 
would stand in the way of this. No, I can't either

16:00.691 --> 16:09.722
except that when Dr. Trevino wanted to go out and 
get the money to do a project, he was told that That

16:09.955 --> 16:14.560
wasn't his job, to go get the money that had to be 
done by somebody on a higher level. So he didn't get

16:16.162 --> 16:18.524
to go, and so the money never came.

16:21.668 --> 16:23.930
But why didn't you have these problems? Because 
President Rutter had simply said, you fellows get

16:24.491 --> 16:29.957
on with it, and we did. Nobody stood in our way. And 
we never got 10 cents from the experiment station

16:32.220 --> 16:38.967
and never wanted it, because we wanted to be free to 
do as we chose, you see. And at that time the vet

16:39.841 --> 16:46.071
school wasn't getting hardly anything from the 
experiment station either. The vet school was

16:47.413 --> 16:51.860
free and we were free to do as we needed to do. But 
once the experiment station got domineering over

16:53.763 --> 17:08.025
the vet school and after they appointed the 
current associate dean for research who took my

16:53.763 --> 17:08.025
job, As an assistant to the director of the 
experiment station, that was the end of

17:08.866 --> 17:14.011
everything. Because he has to do what he's told by 
the experiment station. It's a damn tragedy

17:20.317 --> 17:22.940
what's happened. Has the experiment station 
getting in on funding, has their funding

17:23.160 --> 17:32.369
increased to the College of Veterinary Medicine 
quite a bit? It has some, but I don't think It's

17:37.638 --> 17:42.364
enough so that the dean doesn't want to lose it, I'm 
sure. And on the other hand, has the amount of

17:42.845 --> 17:54.660
independence of other parts of the vet school been 
decreased because of the experiment station? I

17:54.920 --> 17:56.222
really can't answer that. I don't know. I don't 
know. I haven't really been concerned with this

17:58.885 --> 18:04.633
part of it.

18:04.653 --> 18:06.295
I suspect so, but I don't know.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.185
And what do you think the future is for the 
institute? Well, it has a tremendous potential if

18:13.987 --> 18:23.918
the barrier in the pipeline could be wiped out or 
eliminated or totally keep out of it. That's all it

18:24.979 --> 18:25.900
would take. There's plenty of opportunities to 
get money right today. In the last year, there have

18:30.225 --> 18:36.552
been some opportunities from Latin American 
countries, from Mexico, in addition to those

18:38.202 --> 18:44.568
earlier offers we got from Nigeria and places like 
that. But for some reason, none of them have been

18:44.588 --> 18:47.670
accepted. I don't know why. It doesn't make sense. 
When a program out there would increase

18:53.275 --> 19:06.387
opportunities to export Texas livestock and 
decrease the threat of exotic disease to Texas

18:53.275 --> 19:06.387
livestock industry, it just doesn't make sense to 
me prevent it happening. So I don't understand it.

19:13.857 --> 19:17.162
But in your opinion the main problem is just on a 
personal level then. That's right. I think it's

19:17.842 --> 19:28.155
one individual who for some reason wanted to 
dominate the thing to the point that he cut it off

19:17.842 --> 19:28.155
and didn't, and for some reason

19:30.565 --> 19:38.976
He and Trevino didn't get along because Trevino 
wanted to get on with things and the other fellow

19:30.565 --> 19:38.976
wanted to do it and didn't find time to do anything. 
That's the only thing I can say.

19:44.743 --> 19:47.887
It's a tragedy, really, when the need is so great. 
How did you get along with this person? I never had

19:50.030 --> 19:51.692
anything to do with him, fortunately. I served as 
the director of the Institute for from 64 through,

19:58.763 --> 20:08.213
I'm sorry, from 74 through 76, when he took my job as 
associate dean. See, I retired from associate

20:08.413 --> 20:15.501
deanship in 74, but I stayed on for two more years 
just at the Institute. Well, fortunately, during

20:16.782 --> 20:23.770
that period of time, we still had money coming from 
aid, so there wasn't a real problem. And he didn't

20:24.891 --> 20:28.635
have anything to do with that, because that was 
already established. But once then in 77, he moved

20:29.273 --> 20:37.988
from associate dean of research up to director of 
the experiment station. And Trevino took my

20:39.791 --> 20:46.502
place, and that's when the water was cut off. 
Unfortunately, the aid program was due for

20:46.522 --> 20:52.632
renewal at that time.

20:54.923 --> 21:03.772
And, but it possibly would have been, plus the 
additional money that could have come in from

20:54.923 --> 21:03.772
other sources, but never were accepted. So if he 
wouldn't have become director of the experiment

21:04.172 --> 21:13.582
station, I mean, if he would have become director 
of the experiment station while you were still at

21:04.172 --> 21:13.582
the institute, you might have had problems also. 
Oh, I think so, yeah. I think so. I think anybody

21:15.804 --> 21:19.387
would have had problems. At least that's my 
impression.

21:25.079 --> 21:25.880
Well, that's a shame. You would think that the 
Experiment Station would want to increase

21:26.061 --> 21:29.987
funding. Yeah, I don't understand it. I don't 
understand it at all.

21:37.538 --> 21:39.421
But you think that Vandiver might be moving? I hope 
so. I certainly do. There was a meeting of the

21:43.047 --> 21:53.162
Animal Health Commission in which Trevino was 
present and Experiment Station Director was

21:43.047 --> 21:53.162
present. Gil got up and sold them on the need for 
acceptance of some foreign funds to get on with the

21:54.678 --> 22:03.429
program. And the other man got up right afterward 
and said that the Experiment Station wouldn't

22:03.549 --> 22:10.438
have anything to do with it. What

22:12.881 --> 22:17.707
was the reasoning? I don't know. I don't know. It 
just doesn't make sense. I think it was a personal

22:23.264 --> 22:25.907
matter primarily. I just thank the Lord I wasn't 
directly involved at that time, but it still burns

22:26.728 --> 22:43.747
me up to think that anybody would do that to a 
program that we had going so well for a 12-year

22:26.728 --> 22:43.747
period and then cut the water off just for personal 
reasons.

22:47.051 --> 22:48.833
Well, let's talk about One last thing I guess that 
maybe you have something else that we should talk

22:49.606 --> 23:11.388
about, but I'd like you to talk about the 
development of A&M from the time you were there,

22:49.606 --> 23:11.388
how it improved, and I'd like you to compare A&M, 
that college, to others in the country.

23:16.413 --> 23:18.735
Well, when I came here in 64, The vet school had a 
three-year program. They had condensed the

23:25.352 --> 23:31.020
four-year program into three years by avoiding 
summer vacations. In order to be able to handle the

23:32.202 --> 23:44.181
large number of students that were interested in 
veterinary medicine, they typically had about

23:32.202 --> 23:44.181
seven applications for each space in the vet 
school at that time. And there were around 35, 38

23:48.803 --> 23:57.033
students in the vet college per class all during 
those years with great pressure on them. And so

23:58.435 --> 24:06.766
this, I believe, during that time period was the 
largest veterinary school in terms of class

23:58.435 --> 24:06.766
attendance of any in the United States. And so 
there was great pressure on the staff and on the

24:08.588 --> 24:12.993
facilities here. And so during the late 60s, there 
was sizable expansion in terms of physical plant

24:18.993 --> 24:26.162
at the College of Veterinary Medicine. And then in 
the 70s, of course, there in the late 70s, there has

24:28.485 --> 24:39.638
been additional expansion there with the new 
clinical buildings that have just been completed

24:28.485 --> 24:39.638
in the last couple of years. So during this whole 
period from 64 to date, there has been a steady

24:41.140 --> 24:47.768
improvement with good support from university 
funding, from the board to increase facilities to

24:48.018 --> 24:59.391
better accommodate the students. And then about, 
I'm not sure of the date, but around 1975, there was

24:59.531 --> 25:13.266
a biological science component offered. At the 
time when Dean Price retired and took over

25:14.140 --> 25:27.560
biological science and Dean Shelton came in, that 
segment has grown substantially with I don't know

25:14.140 --> 25:27.560
how many students they have. But I know in the first 
couple of years, there were 700 or 800 of them

25:27.640 --> 25:34.089
altogether.

25:37.835 --> 25:41.380
That doesn't mean any one class, of course, but 
collectively. So the pressure for increasing

25:42.322 --> 26:10.185
facilities out there to train biological science 
students, many of whom hope to get into veterinary

25:42.322 --> 26:10.185
medicine after two or three years of preliminary 
sort of pre-veterinary training, that has

25:42.322 --> 26:10.185
greatly increased the activity and demands on 
faculty and increased the size of staff as well as

25:42.322 --> 26:10.185
facilities out there. And to the best of my 
knowledge, TechCNM has one of the best vet schools

26:12.022 --> 26:18.072
in the United States. And it still continues to be, 
I think, the largest one. Now the pressure for

26:23.721 --> 26:39.025
student

26:23.721 --> 26:39.025
vacancies, student entrances, decreased some in 
the last four or five years because there have been

26:23.721 --> 26:39.025
four or five new schools of veterinary medicine in 
the United States. New school in Florida, a new

26:39.899 --> 26:42.643
school in Tennessee.

26:46.189 --> 26:46.950
Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech, that's right. So at 
least three new schools. That's reduced some of

26:52.178 --> 26:53.480
the pressure. So now I think there's only probably 
two or three applicants per vacancy each fall out

26:53.520 --> 27:01.211
there. But it's still, as far as I'm concerned, 
doing very well. doing a good job. Now, you went to

27:07.123 --> 27:08.645
Cornell, huh? And Cornell, of course, is always 
usually mentioned as one of the greatest. Yes. How

27:14.111 --> 27:16.014
would you compare those two institutions? Well,

27:17.496 --> 27:25.045
I think they're both very good in quality. Cornell 
never had as large a student body, excepted as

27:27.368 --> 27:32.474
large a student body as they have here. Cornell is 
more endowed, less state supported institution

27:35.468 --> 27:41.897
in total than Texas A&M. There were just about 40 
students per class, as I recall, when I was there.

27:50.911 --> 27:58.081
But I think they turn out equally competent 
veterinarians, I believe. Now let's compare

27:58.482 --> 27:59.483
this. You've had a lot of international 
experience. And I've never asked anybody about

28:03.464 --> 28:07.450
the quality of the vet schools in other countries. 
How would you compare us with other countries?

28:10.615 --> 28:31.868
Well, it depends on the country, but one of the 
greatest handicaps for vet schools, for example,

28:10.615 --> 28:31.868
in India and Pakistan and some of those related 
countries, is the fact that the hangover of the

28:10.615 --> 28:31.868
caste system is so great that A veterinarian in 
India and Pakistan will have an assistant that

28:32.725 --> 28:46.403
hopefully will do all his physical labor part, and 
he'll stand and tell him what to do. And from my

28:47.845 --> 28:54.214
point of view, that isn't nearly as effective nor 
as efficient as if the veterinarian does it

28:47.845 --> 28:54.214
himself. I've seen Indian veterinarians. stand 
and tell a technician where to cut and what to do

28:58.527 --> 29:05.115
doing an autopsy and things of that sort rather 
than do it themselves. Too often I have seen Indian

29:07.177 --> 29:25.699
fellows who got PhDs in this country in 
laboratories back in India that would sit dressed

29:07.177 --> 29:25.699
up at the desk in the front office when the 
technicians back in the lab didn't know what in the

29:07.177 --> 29:25.699
hell they were doing. and they wouldn't take the 
time or effort to go back and even help them very

29:26.118 --> 29:29.962
much. So I think that's one of the greatest 
handicaps to medicine in general and certainly to

29:31.764 --> 29:45.138
veterinary medicine in those countries that 
still have this sort of hangover of a caste system.

29:45.498 --> 29:49.062
What about Latin America and South America? Well, 
I think it's better there,

29:53.945 --> 30:14.210
for the most part, the veterinarians

29:53.945 --> 30:14.210
in my experience, at least in Latin America, have 
not had the detail of technical training in the

29:53.945 --> 30:14.210
sciences that relate to veterinary medicine that 
we have had in this country. For example, they

30:14.230 --> 30:23.462
don't have, to my knowledge, any colleges of 
American Veterinary College, like the American

30:14.230 --> 30:23.462
College of Veterinary Pathologists, that have to 
get five years of specialized training beyond

30:24.404 --> 30:31.454
their veterinary degree before they become a 
pathologist, you see. And we in this country go

30:31.474 --> 30:50.580
through that sort of additional specialized 
training with usually a PhD involved in order to

30:31.474 --> 30:50.580
become a board member in pathology to study the 
slides and do the pathology with similar

30:31.474 --> 30:50.580
specialties in the various fields. In the United 
States, most of our faculty are people who have

30:51.488 --> 30:58.818
this specialized training in their departments. 
While in Latin America, there's a relative

30:58.838 --> 31:05.567
minimum of people that have got specialized 
training, unless they've gotten it abroad. Now,

31:06.629 --> 31:11.556
some have gone abroad and come to the States and to 
England and so on and got specialized training.

31:11.596 --> 31:18.545
But they're a minimal fraction of their faculty as 
compared to the United States. And I think that's

31:18.565 --> 31:19.707
true. And certainly it's true in Africa and in 
Asian countries. What about Europe? In Europe,

31:27.708 --> 31:33.454
the quality there is more comparable to that in the 
United States with specialized training. And how

31:34.415 --> 31:35.216
about Canada? Yes, I think Canada is very 
comparable to the United States also. I worked for

31:41.804 --> 31:49.272
several years in Canada at this war disease 
control station on an island out in the St.

31:41.804 --> 31:49.272
Lawrence River. Oh really? During the early part 
of the war. And worked with Canadian

31:53.003 --> 32:01.073
veterinarians and I thought they were very 
comparable with those in the States.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.356
You might be a little interested in that. We worked 
up there on rinderpest primarily because it was

32:03.416 --> 32:09.825
considered a major...
