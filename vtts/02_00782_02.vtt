WEBVTT

00:03.423 --> 00:12.752
Then we sort of fell into using faculty members 
extensively to do work which could just as well

00:03.423 --> 00:12.752
have been done by graduate students. And now we're 
coming back to using graduate students more. You

00:18.978 --> 00:20.220
think that's part of getting the system set up? 
Probably, yeah. And again, there are things

00:22.522 --> 00:31.911
where, while a graduate student, for instance, 
might be able to go out and interview a

00:22.522 --> 00:31.911
manufacturer and come back with the same There's, 
again, the additional perspective that

00:32.887 --> 00:49.290
experience gives when the faculty member, the 
mature faculty member, could sit there and say,

00:32.887 --> 00:49.290
now what's this guy really saying? The nuances. 
Yeah. What does he really mean when he says that?

00:53.435 --> 00:56.800
And that's just something you get through 
experience. Are there any points that you'd like

00:56.820 --> 01:02.488
to bring up for posterity that we haven't covered? 
Well, I'd like to be able to look at it ten years from

01:03.278 --> 01:14.191
now and see if everything that we've planned to do 
actually worked out that way. What do you have to

01:14.251 --> 01:17.034
say? Oh, I would like to see InVent as a standalone 
organization with more flexibility to work in and

01:17.054 --> 01:31.851
out of the university, so that it would have to be 
self-supporting and free of state funding at that

01:17.054 --> 01:31.851
point. And I would think that one located here in 
proximity to the university would, but having its

01:32.911 --> 01:52.815
own self-generated funds, would be far more 
flexible in working with the faculty, and as well

01:32.911 --> 01:52.815
as being able to reach out and hire consultants 
from around the state or around the country,

01:32.911 --> 01:52.815
around the world. And I'd like to point with Pri to 
some cubic packages. You know, somebody had to

01:59.590 --> 02:04.397
help Bill Hewitt and Dave Packer. I don't know if I 
can duplicate Fred Terriman, but again, I think

02:04.417 --> 02:16.934
that there's something motivating in that 
direction. Do you think ten years is about the time

02:16.954 --> 02:18.857
that you get self-supporting? Well, that's a 
goal. And again, I'd say if we can't do it in ten

02:21.521 --> 02:29.412
years, then there's something very, very wrong 
with what we're doing.

02:32.564 --> 02:43.380
Although I talked to a fellow yesterday, I thought 
it was yesterday, last month, from University of

02:32.564 --> 02:43.380
Research in Tucson, Arizona. And they were 
originally funded by the Cottrell Foundation to

02:43.400 --> 02:52.554
take university developments and license them. 
They've been in business now for about 50 years,

02:53.055 --> 02:59.685
and it's about breaking even. And 60% of their 
income is due to one patent. So without that lucky

03:03.378 --> 03:06.061
hit, they'd be way behind. On the other hand, 
because we're taking equity in businesses, we

03:06.682 --> 03:13.168
should be doing a lot better. They're just taking 
the royalty. And they're just dealing with

03:15.591 --> 03:17.633
university inventions? Yeah. But on a nationwide 
basis.

03:24.941 --> 03:32.389
What we're doing, we're taking royalties also 
where it's appropriate, but we'll take shares of

03:24.941 --> 03:32.389
stock where that's appropriate. As a result, 
we're not tied in to a given invention as much as we

03:33.365 --> 03:39.432
are tied into a business. And what we say is, fine, 
we're helping you start this business based on

03:39.772 --> 03:46.940
such and such an invention, and we're going to take 
a royalty on that. But that's not for the

03:46.960 --> 03:48.061
invention. That's for starting the business. And 
they'll say, well, for how long are you going to be

03:50.284 --> 03:53.868
royalty? Forever. Well, are you going to help us 
forever and ever? Nope. But you would have given us

03:59.574 --> 04:02.157
10% of your stock if you'd asked for it. And you'd be 
paying us dividends forever and ever on that

04:02.558 --> 04:06.342
stock, unless we sold it. And that's basically 
what we're doing. We're translating an

04:09.226 --> 04:17.956
equivalent issue of stock into a royalty payment, 
simply because you weren't intending to

04:09.226 --> 04:17.956
incorporate in the first place. That's what we're 
doing. But where it's clear that they're going to

04:19.698 --> 04:27.587
incorporate, we may want to take the stock.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.152
You're trying to stimulate business in Texas. Do 
you require that they cooperate in Texas? Well, we

04:35.878 --> 04:38.300
would, yeah, if it were from out of state. And we 
also require that they locate in Texas. There are

04:42.584 --> 04:44.486
three big pieces to a deal. One of them is the mentor 
and invention. The next is the site of the business

04:48.230 --> 04:52.034
or occasion of the business. The third is the 
source of the capital. Ideally, all three of those

04:54.436 --> 04:58.080
would be Texan. If you have to pick one that's most 
important, I would say that's the manufacturing

04:58.499 --> 05:04.187
location. Second importance is the location of 
the inventor, and third would be the source of

05:04.207 --> 05:11.898
capital. And if you're saying, well, I want to see 
direct employment, then it's obviously the

05:11.918 --> 05:21.110
source of the manufacturing location, isn't it? 
So if it takes and came up to you and said, I want to

05:21.130 --> 05:27.660
start a business in Louisiana, it's going to be 
cheaper? Not necessarily. They may wind up that

05:28.283 --> 05:30.025
way. Try talking them into bringing it to Texas? 
Well, see what the benefit to Texas would be. And

05:35.932 --> 05:37.834
we've had contacts from all over the world. And 
when it's from out of state, we'd say, hey, look, if

05:39.877 --> 05:46.464
we're going to work with you, it's got to be Texas. 
Now, it's still untrusted. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

05:47.445 --> 05:49.007
fine, let's put it in writing. Well, I'm not sure 
I'm going to do that.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.414
Anything else you'd like to add? No, I think that's 
about it. All right, well, thank you for your time.
