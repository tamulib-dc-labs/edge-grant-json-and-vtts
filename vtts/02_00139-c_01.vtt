WEBVTT

00:03.811 --> 00:32.248
let's see Jarvis well Jarvis was was a friend of the 
veterinary school having those close

00:03.811 --> 00:32.248
relationships with with the experiment station I

00:03.811 --> 00:32.248
think let's see then he's followed by Frank 
Vandiver Frank now Frank Vandiver is is a person

00:32.701 --> 00:58.202
that wasn't in my opinion wasn't well liked on this 
campus but he was an intellectual giant I'm his

00:32.701 --> 00:58.202
first doctoral student oh is that right well I'm 
not I'm not telling you anything you don't already

00:32.701 --> 00:58.202
know but he was so far ahead of his time on so many 
different things uh I don't I don't remember his

00:32.701 --> 00:58.202
having too much The veterinary school was sort of 
like a stepchild to much of the campus.

01:12.374 --> 01:20.103
Let's see, I think it was in his time that we became a 
line item as opposed to, you know, I think that was

01:12.374 --> 01:20.103
the time. So our funding was pretty much set, you 
know, we were somewhat independent of the... And

01:25.368 --> 01:30.193
then there's Mobley.

01:32.856 --> 01:42.307
Mobley was...

01:32.856 --> 01:42.307
To the typist, that's President William Mobley, 
M-O-B-L-E-Y. Right, right. I don't remember

01:44.169 --> 01:53.620
Mobley having much impact on

01:44.169 --> 01:53.620
the vet school either. at that let's see now about 
that time let's see Shelton was stepping down and

01:54.106 --> 02:23.826
all right Dean Shattuck all right Dean Gage by then 
is over as the chief academic officer that's right

01:54.106 --> 02:23.826
what difference did it make to have a veterinary 
faculty member over as the as the provost to us

01:54.106 --> 02:23.826
faculty it didn't didn't make much difference at 
all we probably saw a few more we probably had more

02:24.127 --> 02:54.066
there was more impact of the potential of the 
veterinary curriculum and well I believe it was

02:24.127 --> 02:54.066
about that time that the biomedical science 
program that actually Al Price had initiated what

02:24.127 --> 02:54.066
if describe that program from the faculty point of 
view okay yeah there's that program emerged about

02:54.890 --> 03:23.057
the same time that the quote unquote threat of 
another vet school at Texas Tech was coming up and

02:54.890 --> 03:23.057
this is kind of a side story but it's somewhat 
relevant Al

02:54.890 --> 03:23.057
Price decided or someone decided and I presume it 
was Al Price decided that instead of having the

03:25.045 --> 03:29.791
program go four years, make it a three-year, 
year-round program. And that way, we would be

03:30.953 --> 03:53.162
meeting, the rationale for another school was 
that there weren't enough veterinary, slots for

03:30.953 --> 03:53.162
veterinary students, and Al, or somebody, and I 
think it was Al's idea that to have a three-year

03:30.953 --> 03:53.162
program as opposed to a four-year program would 
meet all the requirements for the, in fact, That

03:53.699 --> 04:02.796
was the time, that came about the time when there 
was a surplus, a so-called surplus of PhDs and a

03:53.699 --> 04:02.796
surplus, potential surplus of many of the 
professions. And so that, I believe that was the

04:02.876 --> 04:08.607
argument that was used to kind of defeat the... 
Okay, now, the biomedical science program, there

04:08.627 --> 04:15.420
was also a pre-vet curriculum. On the campus. And 
so it, in effect, replaced pre-vet, did it not?

04:21.412 --> 04:23.237
Yeah, that's what they wanted it to do. That was the 
ration. I mean, that's what the veterinary

04:25.442 --> 04:31.857
profession, you know, the veterinary powers that 
be wanted it to do. And it included then students

04:32.410 --> 04:37.256
who might go into other health-related... They 
didn't, yes, they didn't want to say that it was a

04:37.276 --> 04:40.380
pre-vet program. They wanted it to, I mean, they 
wanted it to be a program that would meet, and Al

04:40.400 --> 04:46.607
Price was the strong proponent of that. In fact, I 
believe that was his brainchild, really. Did that

04:49.230 --> 04:57.280
bring a lot, that obviously brought a lot more 
students to interact with veterinary faculty?

04:57.520 --> 04:59.262
Well, yes, definitely. Definitely. That served a 
two-fold purpose. Again, from the faculty, you

05:04.067 --> 05:28.371
know, back to the faculty, if I had been department 
head, I would have wanted to look at it, or

05:04.067 --> 05:28.371
administrative, I'd want to look at it from 
another, but from the faculty point of view, it

05:04.067 --> 05:28.371
gave justification for more teaching activity, 
justification for more positions and that sort of

05:04.067 --> 05:28.371
thing by essentially creating courses that 
That'd be great.

05:34.696 --> 05:43.274
And so the biomedical science program was again

05:34.696 --> 05:43.274
Al Price's brainchild. It gave raison d'etre for 
many of the faculty. And it ultimately had a

05:52.972 --> 05:55.876
positive effect. At first, it seemed like it was 
kind of a hocus. I mean, I'm expressing my own view

06:00.682 --> 06:03.846
at that time. I don't think it is. Ultimately, it's 
a very worthwhile program. But at that time, it

06:09.174 --> 06:20.869
seemed to be a way that the veterinary

06:09.174 --> 06:20.869
activities could capture more people from the 
campus. and instead of their going over to the

06:21.710 --> 06:27.879
campus to take the courses, they would come over to 
the vet school to take the course. Of course, they

06:27.899 --> 06:40.038
said that that's taking away too many resources 
from the school, but in actual practice, that, you

06:27.899 --> 06:40.038
know, we were sort of talking out of both sides of 
our mouth. And so we were able then to get not only

06:40.278 --> 06:46.468
line item funds, but, you know, formula funds too. 
Now, during the the 70s, 80s, 90s, women began to

06:50.971 --> 07:00.343
enroll in veterinary medicine in increasingly 
large numbers. Yes. Give some examples. How did

07:04.068 --> 07:05.910
that change? Before I answer that, let me point out 
that the young lady that was the first vet student

07:07.572 --> 07:19.307
happened to work with Wayne Moore as a part-time. 
so I didn't get I didn't know her you know very well

07:20.148 --> 07:43.303
but she was part of the team that was taking care of 
the swine and and so forth yeah this is this is for

07:20.148 --> 07:43.303
you if you if you've already got that well no what 
happens no thank you um

07:20.148 --> 07:43.303
but uh she

07:46.388 --> 07:54.178
I don't know how much truth there was to anything, 
but she was kind of attacked, her morals were

07:46.388 --> 07:54.178
attacked. Some were saying that she was sleeping 
around. She had responsibilities out there in

07:58.403 --> 08:01.327
veterinary research. You may not want to include 
this in anything that you, but this is just sort of

08:02.028 --> 08:06.794
the background. She wasn't well received by the 
faculty, by the students. in general and they made

08:14.823 --> 08:43.294
allegations that she was sleeping around and that 
she was actually sleeping out there in some of the

08:14.823 --> 08:43.294
facilities out there in Veterinary Research Park 
she and some other guy who were dating who were

08:14.823 --> 08:43.294
actually dating and they were seen out there a lot 
of times but I don't think they were doing there was

08:14.823 --> 08:43.294
any hanky panky okay now the how did the advent of 
female students well first of all you know, there

08:44.354 --> 08:58.680
were all kinds of quips and comments made about, 
well, how can a little thing like a lady help

08:44.354 --> 08:58.680
deliver a calf? I mean, sort of like women just 
aren't equipped to be veterinarians they're just

09:06.123 --> 09:30.291
not big enough they're not strong enough they 
don't have the they don't have the how many of them

09:06.123 --> 09:30.291
have ever even ridden a horse you know and of course 
that's just about any any person that grew up on the

09:06.123 --> 09:30.291
farm as I said but there's just no way that they had 
the experiences but nonetheless

09:06.123 --> 09:30.291
they were admitted in in increasing large numbers 
and I believe Probably three years after, three,

09:31.368 --> 09:43.509
maybe four years after they started admitting 
females, about 50% of the class was female. And I

09:44.210 --> 09:50.541
think because of the academic selection process,

09:51.685 --> 10:00.956
I don't know whether these statistics are valid or 
not, but generally the ladies will perform better

09:51.685 --> 10:00.956
academically than will the men. That's what I 
heard. And so if the selection criteria were based

10:03.318 --> 10:18.496
primarily on grades, and they were, then it's 
reasonable to think that an increasingly larger

10:03.318 --> 10:18.496
number of girls would enter the class. And in the 
same period, more women joined the faculty.

10:27.415 --> 10:28.437
Well, let's see. Let me think now. Weren't there a 
few? There were a few, but not a large number. Let's

10:34.264 --> 10:34.725
see. Now, I can think of, well, Mary Heron was on the 
faculty. And she was brought in largely because of

10:41.253 --> 10:48.102
the Department Head of Anatomy. was a good friend 
with Mike Herron, who was a clinician. So this is a

10:55.621 --> 10:59.065
package of the two? Yeah, yeah. Then, let's see.

11:07.976 --> 11:10.119
I don't know if there's any relationship. I don't 
know what the relationship may be of this, but

11:10.800 --> 11:15.686
Bonnie Beaver was also another. And she'd be a good 
one, too. I've already interviewed her. Oh, okay.

11:20.684 --> 11:22.926
She was brought in. Then over in the clinic area,

11:22.986 --> 11:33.638
oh gee, I'm drawing a blank on her name. I know her 
quite well now. She's the oncologist, but she was a

11:34.799 --> 11:41.386
third one that was a female faculty member. What 
about the cat lady? She was there for quite a while.

11:46.631 --> 11:47.232
What's her name?

11:51.717 --> 11:53.100
I'm drawing a blank. I don't know. There weren't 
but three or four out of an entire faculty of about

11:54.784 --> 11:59.535
200 at that time. And then as

12:00.417 --> 12:05.389
soon as the non-DVM-PhD mold was broken, a large 
number of potent, you know, stellar. That's in the

12:15.264 --> 12:17.268
in the 80s? That's in the mid-80s. Mid-80s? Yeah. 
Then started bringing in some People that had, you

12:22.818 --> 12:35.198
know, NIH types, several of the people that are 
there now were, you know, were pretty well known in

12:22.818 --> 12:35.198
their area from other areas. Compare, in a broad 
sense, compare the veterinary medical students

12:35.238 --> 12:42.430
today in terms of their background and their 
capability and their interests with those when

12:44.114 --> 12:50.324
you first joined faculty? Oh,

12:51.506 --> 12:59.820
frankly, the students, even though they're 
younger, number one, they're more mature. They

13:00.381 --> 13:03.827
seem to be more mature.

13:05.343 --> 13:17.217
I don't know if it's intellectual

13:05.343 --> 13:17.217
capability or whether it's just, but the students 
today are much more sophisticated. They're much

13:17.277 --> 13:21.582
more than the students back then. The students 
back then, well, there may have been some

13:22.263 --> 13:27.670
modeling, too, back then. The students back then 
were more, you might have trouble distinguishing

13:34.672 --> 13:43.585
the students from,

13:34.672 --> 13:43.585
that were shoeing horses from veterinary 
students. I mean, the people that were shoeing

13:43.645 --> 13:55.662
horses and, you know, they were, back then, they 
were not real, you know, science oriented and

13:43.645 --> 13:55.662
certainly not computer oriented or anything like 
that. But today they are. And today's students are

13:56.964 --> 13:58.907
more urban? In their background? Very much more. 
Very much more. And very much savvy with regard to

14:01.228 --> 14:09.618
health issues, you know, and interested in 
health-related issues. In terms of their

14:09.638 --> 14:14.764
interests, large animal, small animal, or 
whatever, has that changed much? Yeah. Yep, it

14:15.745 --> 14:16.426
has. How?

14:20.070 --> 14:21.452
Fewer and fewer in the... Well, there's still a 
significant number in food animal, you know,

14:23.052 --> 14:32.705
cattle type interest. Fewer in equine practices, 
so, and the other practices are negligible. Small

14:42.878 --> 14:51.169
animal is probably, I would imagine, I haven't 
looked at the statistics, frankly, but my sense is

14:42.878 --> 14:51.169
that the majority of the people that graduate from 
vet school these days are interested in small

14:52.027 --> 14:56.415
animal. And many are interested in academics. And 
that surprises me. Many are interested in

15:02.846 --> 15:05.530
research and academics. And I think that speaks 
well of the, you know, the academic environment in

15:06.292 --> 15:15.267
the vet school as opposed to several years ago. And 
I presume that geographically they are quite

15:15.618 --> 15:21.205
diverse from all over Texas. All over Texas with 
the preponderance, no, still again, the

15:21.425 --> 15:26.231
preponderance from the metropolitan areas. 
Yeah, but whether it's Amarillo or Corpus Christi

15:26.251 --> 15:30.116
or whatever. Right. And are they more diverse as to 
where they did their undergraduate degree than

15:31.458 --> 15:36.304
they used to be? I

15:36.324 --> 15:41.490
believe the... Frankly, the largest number of 
people that do their, well, a significant number

15:42.905 --> 15:53.659
of biomedical science students, you know, here on 
this campus, from this campus. But I don't say that

15:53.879 --> 15:56.302
they're the majority. I think probably next in the 
order of undergraduate programs are from,

15:57.243 --> 16:08.097
there's a large number of them from the University 
of Texas. And that's, you know, I would be kind of

16:09.039 --> 16:12.523
surprised about that. Right now, after you were 
the interim department head, you went back to the

16:13.398 --> 16:20.306
department, and what have been your duties in 
recent years? Well, I had a fairly active research

16:21.608 --> 16:23.891
program. In fact, my research program grew. I was 
doing a lot. What were the primary topics?

16:32.001 --> 16:34.664
Primarily various aspects of aquatic animal 
medicine. I started to say, and I forgot about it,

16:35.665 --> 16:42.173
one of the things that... that Frank Vandiver did 
he had a he called a conference together or called a

16:42.440 --> 17:07.519
group together to explore water issues

16:42.440 --> 17:07.519
and he was he was wanting a brainstorming session 
he called a group of people together to do it for a

16:42.440 --> 17:07.519
brainstorming session that had to do with with 
water issues and one of the things that I had

17:08.680 --> 17:15.748
suggested that we have a training program for 
veterinarians, and that we call it Aquamed.

17:17.551 --> 17:18.091
Aquahunt? Aquamed. Aquamed.

17:22.657 --> 17:36.493
He was really excited about that, and so he 
advanced something like $20,000 to support that

17:22.657 --> 17:36.493
program, which is more really than we needed, but 
we subsequently

17:38.549 --> 17:40.011
I guess I'm kind of getting off the subject. I 
forgot what the topic was, but the point is that

17:40.071 --> 17:55.716
Aquamed was something that lasted for about, I 
mean, from Texas A&M it lasted until about the 91 or

17:40.071 --> 17:55.716
92, and another guy and I headed it up. We would go 
down to Galveston, for a couple of weeks and we had

17:59.508 --> 18:25.330
students from all the veterinary schools, I mean 
from, you know, several of the veterinary schools

17:59.508 --> 18:25.330
across the country to come in and invest, you know, 
be exposed to various fish, mammal, you know,

17:59.508 --> 18:25.330
aquatic animal topics there on the campus, just 
hands on. dissecting the fish and looking at

18:25.765 --> 18:29.905
parasites and those kind of things. Going out on an 
oyster lover. Yeah. Yeah, a very intensive

18:34.085 --> 18:41.315
two-week program, and we just sort of took over the 
campus. But that was through Frank Vanderburg.

18:44.460 --> 18:47.023
Now, let's see, we were talking about, I forgot. 
Well, what you're... Yeah, what I was doing, yeah,

18:47.084 --> 18:51.069
after I stepped down. Okay, so one of the things I 
did was to, one of the things I was involved in was

18:51.189 --> 19:00.683
the development of that program, the Aquamed 
program, which still exists.

19:02.620 --> 19:07.386
But we're not, Texas A&M doesn't have a major 
portion, part in it now. I had a building that, out

19:09.569 --> 19:32.020
on the Veterinary Research Park, I set up a closed 
recirculating system

19:09.569 --> 19:32.020
for maintaining

19:09.569 --> 19:32.020
fish and shrimp and various aquatic species under 
fairly defined conditions. I had a lot of fun in

19:32.337 --> 19:34.159
trying to design that. I'd never done anything 
like that before.

19:38.704 --> 19:43.991
I mean, we could maintain the right temperature, 
right oxygen concentration, salinity, you know,

19:38.704 --> 19:43.991
all those kind of things. And I was pretty well 
funded at that time. I was able to, I had about, oh,

19:47.294 --> 20:01.551
let's see, I had a technician, I had three 
technicians and one research associate, and then

19:47.294 --> 20:01.551
I had several graduate students working with me. 
We occupied the building that formerly was known

20:01.919 --> 20:08.542
as the Tropical Veterinary Medical Institute. 
That's another, that's something, that's

20:09.947 --> 20:14.443
another topic that could, I wasn't involved in, 
but that's something that the veterinary school

20:14.744 --> 20:22.735
had a, was a very good program for several years. 
But anyway, when that program was abandoned, then

20:23.897 --> 20:31.788
I had the opportunity to move out there in that 
facility, and I moved out there, and I spent much of

20:23.897 --> 20:31.788
my time there. Then

20:33.430 --> 20:38.878
I was involved in an automobile accident. and that 
I mean it was actually in a wheelchair for quite

20:40.462 --> 21:06.486
some time and I couldn't get around very well and so 
I

20:40.462 --> 21:06.486
wasn't inclined to do very much research writing I 
was teaching a course I was asked to teach a course

20:40.462 --> 21:06.486
it wasn't forced upon me but when they asked me I was 
happy to do so so I started teaching a course on

20:40.462 --> 21:06.486
immunology I also started teaching the course on 
fish diseases I was teaching a course on

21:08.103 --> 21:32.608
microbiology and because I was wasn't able to get 
around very well my program sort of I mean for a

21:08.103 --> 21:32.608
number of reasons my program folded my principal 
technician decided she'd been there for about 20

21:08.103 --> 21:32.608
years with me and so she decided that she wanted to 
retire and so when she retired well we didn't she

21:33.044 --> 21:56.115
was getting paid out of experiment station funds 
and we you know we moved those well make a long story

21:33.044 --> 21:56.115
short I moved up to the main building and I didn't 
have extensive laboratory but then I got

21:33.044 --> 21:56.115
interested in doing um all interactive uh 
computer-based web-based instructional

21:56.602 --> 22:26.068
distance learning I wrote a project

21:56.602 --> 22:26.068
for the USDA a competitive project and involved 
that involved several of the other veterinary

21:56.602 --> 22:26.068
schools and we taught a course via satellite tv one 
summer no one spring that involved the six the six

21:56.602 --> 22:26.068
veterinary schools Auburn, Mississippi, 
Alabama, Florida,

22:27.213 --> 22:40.149
Tuskegee, and ourselves. And we formed what was 
called an aquatic pathobiology consortium. But

22:46.437 --> 22:55.549
through the USDA, we got funding to put that thing 
up on satellite TV and made it available across the

22:46.437 --> 22:55.549
country. And we actually offered the course, 
probably one of the first courses, maybe not, but I

22:56.660 --> 23:11.129
think it was probably one of the first courses that 
we had, that the A&M had, and we broadcast it to

22:56.660 --> 23:11.129
every veterinary school in the North American 
continent. They had down links from all, and we

23:11.149 --> 23:15.698
got, it was sort of a, The last part of each session, 
these were two lectures a week, and the last part of

23:16.336 --> 23:25.930
each session was kind of like a Larry King Live. 
They would call in questions and that sort of

23:26.431 --> 23:32.279
thing, and we'd interact with them and had a lot of 
fun doing that. Then following that, we put

23:32.339 --> 23:43.896
together a Pew Foundation grant to formalize the 
interaction between the vet schools. And I, at

23:45.344 --> 23:50.210
that time, was becoming more involved in distance 
education. And that's essentially where I've

23:50.911 --> 23:56.098
been focusing my efforts now. I now teach a TTVN 
course to Galveston, usually in the fall. And I

24:03.667 --> 24:06.971
taught it in the spring a couple of times. And I've 
designed interactive CDs for course and for the

24:13.998 --> 24:43.498
fish disease course and for the microbiology 
course these are CDs that the entire course is on a

24:13.998 --> 24:43.498
CD and so that's sort of what we do what I've been 
doing and

24:13.998 --> 24:43.498
I'm not sure you know where is where is where is all 
this going I you know we really My

24:44.896 --> 24:56.736
intent several years ago was to try to get the 
veterinary profession involved in fish health

24:44.896 --> 24:56.736
issues. I proposed that been rearing fish for 
thousands of years in China and Asia, and it's the

24:58.278 --> 25:10.819
most efficient source of protean worldwide. and 
it's it's certainly a potential industry here in

25:11.896 --> 25:27.323
here in the state and in fact we've helped kind of 
establish the shrimp industry here in Texas

25:11.896 --> 25:27.323
they've had some crashes but The funding doesn't 
seem to be there. I'm not sure whether the

25:32.514 --> 25:40.203
veterinary profession is ever going to be aligned 
to fish culture or not. It's kind of one of those

25:41.284 --> 25:43.026
industries. I think the swine industry sort of 
went the same way. The veterinary profession is

25:46.511 --> 25:49.955
not, at least not here in Texas. There's certain 
areas in Minnesota and certain areas that that the

25:56.800 --> 26:19.112
pork industries use veterinary profession now 
there's another thing that I guess we're running

25:56.800 --> 26:19.112
out of time or something we've got another half 
hour oh okay

25:56.800 --> 26:19.112
this doesn't necessarily relate to me but it does 
kind of relate to me it relates to a perception that

25:56.800 --> 26:19.112
I have the Department of Veterinary Microbiology 
was merged with Veterinary Pathology. And that

26:30.505 --> 26:33.911
was the general trend to merge departments. I 
guess they did that in most institutions across

26:33.971 --> 26:37.397
the country. But microbiology was by far the more 
aggressive, I mean, several people in the

26:46.312 --> 27:04.573
department that were very aggressive in in 
extramural you know seeking extramural funds

26:46.312 --> 27:04.573
plus there was a fairly strong poultry program you 
know that had to do with poultry and that was led by

27:04.790 --> 27:33.936
Charlie and Charles Hall and Leland Grumbles they 
were recognized nationwide as as really the

27:04.790 --> 27:33.936
number one people in the poultry area and the state 
poultry is a big it was and still is a big industry in

27:04.790 --> 27:33.936
in Texas

27:04.790 --> 27:33.936
but kind of simultaneous to the to the emergence of 
microbiology and pathology the poultry

27:35.148 --> 27:57.645
activities were shifted from the department over 
to the diagnostic lab we'll see that and that's

27:35.148 --> 27:57.645
that's reasonable that it should have been I mean 
diagnostic activity should but you see we some of

27:35.148 --> 27:57.645
our faculty that we had faculty members that were 
stationed at the various strategic areas around

27:35.148 --> 27:57.645
the states I mean, their primary responsibility, 
they were veterinary experiment station

27:58.722 --> 28:10.680
appointments, but they were situated in the heart 
of the poultry industry. And so they were

28:11.942 --> 28:16.930
identifying some problems and were getting 
funding. I mean, they were the source of funding

28:17.631 --> 28:23.380
for a number of, for a lot of poultry disease 
research. But following the merge of the two

28:24.659 --> 28:42.267
departments, pathology and microbiology, that 
activity essentially went to the diagnostic lab

28:24.659 --> 28:42.267
and so the reason for the poultry program that 
existed in the department was gone. And some of the

28:43.449 --> 28:50.160
key players

28:43.449 --> 28:50.160
went elsewhere at that time. They went to USDA Ames 
and Cornell and some of the other places because

28:50.377 --> 28:59.807
they were the second generation of poultry 
people. But when that poultry area was lost, well,

29:01.208 --> 29:06.394
then they left. And I think, I'm not sure we're, we 
may be better off as a result of it, but I'm not sure

29:06.474 --> 29:14.342
we didn't lose an opportunity there. And I think

29:14.903 --> 29:19.928
we probably, It may be 20 or 30 years before 
veterinary medicine starts looking at aquatic

29:20.785 --> 29:31.277
animal medicine in a serious way. But at some 
point, it will have to because that's going to be an

29:31.297 --> 29:41.508
area of food and so forth down the way. And I teach a 
course to veterinary students on fish diseases.

29:49.085 --> 29:56.512
To have 15 students that will, 15 or so students 
that will, they have a very busy schedule. This is

29:56.933 --> 29:59.382
called a didactic elective. And to even have five 
students that are willing to take a course is kind

30:00.526 --> 30:06.753
of unusual. But I routinely have 10 to 15 students 
sign up for that course. It's a two-week course,

30:12.740 --> 30:18.046
and it deals with diseases of fish. And so I think 
from that seed, I think at some future point,

30:18.086 --> 30:28.879
there'll be students, veterinarians that'll be 
more focused on fish diseases. Let's summarize

30:29.213 --> 30:33.478
this more than 30 years experience. Of all that 
you've done here, what's been your most enjoyable

30:33.899 --> 30:39.546
task? Oh, gee. What was the most pleasant, most 
fun? Well, the...

30:44.893 --> 30:52.082
Actually...

30:52.906 --> 30:54.608
I've just had a lot of fun doing everything. I mean, 
it's the research, the working with the EIA virus

30:54.888 --> 31:06.843
and the identification of the, you know, to do 
something, to kind of pioneer something. I've had

31:06.883 --> 31:09.887
an opportunity to pioneer at least two things. You 
know, that and the aquatic animal area.

31:17.076 --> 31:22.002
That's been, and... You had fun with... being a 
consultant today.
