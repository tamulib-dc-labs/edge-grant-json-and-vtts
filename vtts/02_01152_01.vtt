was a few feet above us, but he didn't know us. Then

05:17.671 --> 05:21.317
we went on the train to see him again. And we sat on a 
bed where on the train. And we saw probably don't be

05:27.453 --> 05:30.219
wouldn't grow. It was confusing because little 
world came walking, walking, giving us donuts.

05:37.447 --> 05:45.907
And

05:37.447 --> 05:45.907
everybody wanted a pillow, so we cooked one and 
everybody else cooked one. And it was confusing on

05:45.927 --> 05:53.245
the train, so we went for a little walk on the train 
and got into a maze. And finally, we ate all the hot

05:53.377 --> 05:57.883
dogs and all the bread on the train. We made a big 
mess and tear, and floated, and we were at there.

06:03.411 --> 06:16.128
And then we drive to Christian Request to go on the 
couch, and we were, and I was tired, and we went and

got in the trees, and we slipped in the tree, and a 
woman who was, and he could not do this there. He

06:16.569 --> 06:19.333
could not do it either. And his hands were messing 
it up. And Grover came and said, hi, bye-bye, we're

06:21.997 --> 06:26.286
going, bye! Bye! He was sitting in that glass, 
speaking, and we came on the drive to see Robert

06:41.960 --> 07:07.427
got wet on the shoes and he put on the water and he got 
on the shoes and he tied up the clothes and

06:41.960 --> 07:07.427
he chopped off the hair and he got off the ice. And 
they cut off their bone hairs. And they took away

07:12.633 --> 07:15.176
Grandpa and Grandpa's house. And they took away 
the bone hair donut. And they took away Grandpa and

07:18.641 --> 07:21.865
