it became a joke or a mockery from the standpoint 
that they finally learned how to manipulate

00:02.427 --> 00:11.735
student teachers. So I have three children who 
went through the consolidated school system, and

00:11.755 --> 00:22.024
if they learned one thing, it was how to manipulate 
people because of their exposure to so many

00:11.755 --> 00:22.024
people. They had students in and out at all times. 
So I think that that is a hazard of our young people

00:24.886 --> 00:31.692
who will be in this community or at Huntsville or 
Austin or certainly the Houston area where as we

00:32.093 --> 00:41.227
have to send our young people out for observation 
more and more. So I see that as a real problem. It's

00:44.692 --> 00:53.005
going to be difficult for us from one point of view, 
but our student teaching centers are in what we

00:53.879 --> 00:59.407
call the best areas of the state, regardless of the 
close proximity to the university. For example,

00:59.427 --> 01:05.596
we go to Fredericksburg, Mason, Bracken Ridge, 
all the way to the Oklahoma border, Sherman. We go

01:05.856 --> 01:07.178
to the Houston schools. We go south of San Antonio 
to Jurgenton. To place your students for student

01:09.501 --> 01:11.684
teaching? For student teaching. So even that may 
have to change on us. Do you still have to follow the

01:17.953 --> 01:21.418
whole semester that the College of Education 
requires? We do not follow the whole semester. We

01:23.900 --> 01:27.928
are six weeks on campus and nine weeks off campus in 
student teaching.

01:31.134 --> 01:34.961
I really appreciate your time and your 
perception. Well, good luck to you. Thank you. And

01:37.465 --> 01:38.888
if I have a question, I hope.
