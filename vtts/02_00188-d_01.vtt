WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:06.962
Having Waco as a court trip also.

00:10.747 --> 00:19.958
But I mean, then even after that, because the court 
trips then became Dallas and Fort Worth, Austin

00:10.747 --> 00:19.958
and Houston. I don't know. I never did figure out 
which one was where, but they had a court trip. I

00:28.408 --> 00:29.610
never was on one of them. I do know that they went 
into your eyes one day. for the Corps trip, and they

00:33.562 --> 00:53.805
had a whole empty section of the Corps bleachers up 
there, and the Corps didn't have that kind of money

00:33.562 --> 00:53.805
that they were charging for those things, and 
there was all these empty seats up there. The boys,

00:53.845 --> 01:03.096
if you take 500 or 1,000 of them,

01:11.767 --> 01:21.138
During

01:11.767 --> 01:21.138
your freshman year, do you remember going to some 
out-of-town games? No, I never went to, very

01:22.560 --> 01:27.666
seldom went to out-of-town. Now, the WTAW was the 
first one. that brought the games to any. And that

01:38.354 --> 01:44.380
was done in the air dome. And what they did, they 
used the... So you're saying the out-of-town

01:48.585 --> 01:55.412
games would be broadcast back to the air dome?

01:55.793 --> 02:04.302
They got some people over there at the game, and 
they got the Western Union to give them a teletype.

02:08.403 --> 02:15.152
And they would send it right there, and then this 
guy would get up there and read it off, you know.

02:15.672 --> 02:19.137
That's the way we found out about it at first. So did 
y'all go over there and have fun during the game?

02:22.301 --> 02:23.583
Oh, we'd go. No, it was in the air dome. No, I mean in 
the air dome. Did you go over there? We just The only

02:29.797 --> 02:50.775
place I, the only time I was much in that air dome was 
early, they used to have some, some very glory

02:29.797 --> 02:50.775
pictures of movies of people

02:53.354 --> 03:00.940
on boats, you know, fighting and cutting guys open 
and this thing and that thing, you know. So what had

03:02.001 --> 03:22.939
happened was that my dad and mother would sit there 
on the first row to the left over there and there was

03:02.001 --> 03:22.939
a door right there, a great big open door and there 
was clothes and so it would get to be like that and we

03:02.001 --> 03:22.939
three would jump up and run out. And then my mother 
gave us a high sign, we can come back in.

03:34.412 --> 03:39.159
That's what the early days, the real early days of 
that thing was. Now when you were a fish, was the

03:40.180 --> 03:46.769
Aggie slang already in use? Oh yeah, the Aggie 
slang. You had to wear a band, a white band. to

03:53.058 --> 03:57.842
identify yourself as a fish, describe the kinds of 
uniforms y'all wore. What did the uniforms look

03:57.902 --> 04:00.845
like that y'all were issued then? They were

04:00.885 --> 04:09.973
wool, standard wool. What colors? Green. No 
khaki? No khaki. No, no, no, no khaki. They were

04:17.879 --> 04:22.103
what you would call, what did you call them, green? 
Was it pretty well World War I style? They had

04:27.101 --> 04:30.965
leggings, but they didn't have to wind them. The 
first one, yeah, that's right. The first ones I

04:33.407 --> 04:37.591
got, they just buttoned up on the side, on the 
outside. Now, did a freshman, a fish, wear

04:37.991 --> 04:40.213
leggings? Yeah. And is that what you wore to class? 
Yeah. Shoes, what color shoes? Brown or black?

04:51.884 --> 04:52.005
Brown. Brown. What kind of hat? Oh, you had a big 
one. Freshman, and you wore that every day? Yeah,

05:04.682 --> 05:09.627
but you couldn't put the strap behind your head. 
Why? You were an upperclassman. Ah, so you had

05:16.153 --> 05:22.279
to... You had to wear it down on the front. And you 
couldn't put it back there like that. That's the

05:28.436 --> 05:29.718
first thing I learned. All right, now, when you did 
anything on the campus during the daytime, did you

05:31.020 --> 05:39.531
wear your uniform? Yeah. But then when you went 
home for supper, you took it off? Yeah. Now, did you

05:44.819 --> 05:47.563
come back to the campus much at night? And if so, 
why? They had some different... functions there.

05:56.955 --> 06:07.867
One of them, the reason I remember this is because 
my cousin was living with us in 1930. He

06:09.108 --> 06:13.933
was a year ahead of me. And he entered the math 
contest. They had a math contest there. And if you

06:25.203 --> 06:28.848
won the math contest, you got the gold watch. They 
gave you gold. And

06:33.774 --> 06:48.033
I remember he came home, and in our house, the 
living room was here, and the big old double doors,

06:33.774 --> 06:48.033
and then there's a stairway going upstairs. And he 
came through the door there and started up the

06:48.854 --> 06:55.142
stairs, and Dad asked him, How'd you come out?

07:00.143 --> 07:01.706
He just held up that watch.

07:07.015 --> 07:09.800
He was a genius at math. He understood it. I 
understood math, but I never could make it

07:12.664 --> 07:20.758
function. Now, as you and your buddies were going 
to class, did you all have to whip out to every

07:22.122 --> 07:27.988
upperclassman as you walked along the sidewalk? 
Whatever they had, we did it. It didn't make any

07:32.032 --> 07:32.973
difference. Then you had to learn their name? No. 
You didn't? I never did learn. The people I knew

07:39.119 --> 07:51.572
were the ones that were in class with me in the A 
engineering, or some of the students that I was

07:39.119 --> 07:51.572
with all the time. Describe a typical day, class 
day for you. You got up at what time, ate breakfast

07:55.701 --> 07:59.345
when, and where did you go? You just had to figure 
out, you had to go figure out which room you were

07:59.986 --> 08:05.552
going to be in. When you, when you registered, you 
went and figured out where you had to go, and they

08:06.714 --> 08:13.842
had room to specify for you. But, but living where 
you lived, what time did you get up and have

08:14.343 --> 08:18.808
breakfast? I don't remember anything. Their 
mother had that thing on that table back in the

08:22.541 --> 08:27.168
back. And you walked over to the campus. Either 
walked over or Dad took us. Okay. And during the

08:34.878 --> 08:38.403
day, did you go to class regularly? Or did you skip 
class? No, we didn't skip class. So you went to

08:43.891 --> 08:45.173
class regularly. If you had an hour that wasn't 
scheduled. We went over to the. to the library. I

08:57.086 --> 08:58.969
spent many hours in that library. Was there also a 
place where you could go and maybe take a brief

08:59.489 --> 09:05.177
snooze?

09:07.680 --> 09:07.740
No. Where did you go to get a cup of coffee or a 
Coca-Cola?

09:13.108 --> 09:13.388
Why? Oh, yeah, they had a On the north side of the Y, 
in that rounded part there, a couple of men had a

09:17.075 --> 09:28.412
refreshment outfit. On the south side of that 
thing was a barber shop. That's where I went to get

09:34.541 --> 09:36.143
my hair cut. Now, was there a pool table also? No. 
No. There was no pool. I don't remember any pool

09:42.873 --> 09:46.879
table being on any of them campers. Did anybody go 
to Northgate or Southgate to get a soft drink?

09:53.808 --> 09:57.233
Northgate they might have, but there wasn't 
anything there. All there was out there was that

09:58.915 --> 10:11.030
Kyle Billy, which is on that side, and the one 
that's where Lupo's is, I think that's the Kyle

09:58.915 --> 10:11.030
Billy. But there was another one over there, the 
red Billy, and that was about all that was there.

10:16.694 --> 10:21.900
Except Luke and Charlie's, which was in a, where 
the bookstore is. And it was just a big, all-open

10:23.122 --> 10:25.445
store. And you could buy anything you wanted 
there. I don't remember they even had...

10:38.080 --> 10:45.790
The only thing I know we had was a Delaware Punch. We 
would like that stuff.

10:51.855 --> 10:54.579
So, I don't know. You had soft drinks, but they had 
to be in a bottle. And it cost a nickel. Did you and

11:01.587 --> 11:03.630
your buddies drink coffee much? You had several 
waters. You see, the water was exactly the same

11:08.936 --> 11:14.663
then as it is now. except that you had this fault 
line up here just north of Bryan. And as that water

11:20.623 --> 11:28.071
poured through that salt line, you picked up your

11:20.623 --> 11:28.071
sulfur. Then they took the water, all the water 
came off, and they ran it through the condensers in

11:29.112 --> 11:37.922
the power plant to heat it up. And then they had a big 
spray pond out there just south of where it was now

11:39.264 --> 11:44.650
the power plant. It was about a couple of acres in 
there.

11:52.362 --> 11:56.888
And they sprayed it up, trying to get rid of the 
sulfur. But it would still turn the silver. Now,

12:02.035 --> 12:05.900
see, we didn't have plastic stuff in those days. 
You had silver. And it turned? Turned black.

12:12.001 --> 12:16.105
Around the household, that was one of the things 
you had to do about every month. You had to go down

12:16.145 --> 12:24.852
there and help them take the silver polish and 
polish off the silver of them. Back to people,

12:25.133 --> 12:31.258
Tommy Mayo was the director of the library. 
Describe him, please. All I knew about him was he

12:35.001 --> 12:37.444
took care of his mother. And he did that to her. his 
detriment, as far as I'm concerned. I mean, no, not

12:44.516 --> 12:54.910
to, but he did never get a family, if I know of. Was 
he, was the library a pleasant place? Oh, it was

12:59.616 --> 13:02.800
quite nice. The, what do you call it, the first one 
up here? The Cushing. I was sitting in that reading

13:10.360 --> 13:15.729
room many, many hours. About how late at night was 
it open? Do you remember? It was open quite a long

13:21.598 --> 13:25.524
way. I never was there much at night. Did you study 
at home? No.

13:34.037 --> 13:34.337
I was at that time my blood sugar was such that I was 
between a normal person and a diabetic and they

13:35.077 --> 14:03.396
mother and dad insisted you eat three meals a day 
three square meals a day and therefore I never I

13:35.077 --> 14:03.396
couldn't when after I might watch, might do 
something. Of course, we had to take care of the

14:09.221 --> 14:12.185
cows, too. That was a chore, always, and I had to do 
that. And so then, I was always out.

14:26.046 --> 14:30.092
And I finally, after the last ten years, I finally 
conquered it. All right, back to another great

14:31.709 --> 14:35.675
person on campus, Mr. Cashin. Yeah. Describe him, 
please. Very fine man. I don't know.

14:47.014 --> 14:50.079
I know, I remember what he looked like, but I... 
Describe him, what he looked like. Oh, I don't

14:54.005 --> 14:54.866
know. He was son is in the church and I see him every 
time I go in there. Now, did he look more, did Jim or

15:04.473 --> 15:10.041
Red more favor their father? Red.

15:17.531 --> 15:24.900
He wasn't as big a man as Jim was.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.665
See, back in those days, we never did get people 
that were that big. No, everybody was smaller. You

15:32.086 --> 15:33.287
know why, don't you? Didn't eat as much. What they 
ate wasn't any good. And

15:37.571 --> 15:48.761
we didn't, we didn't gain as much weight in the 
middle as... And people did more manual labor.

15:49.983 --> 15:55.868
Well, either labor wouldn't make any difference, 
but you take bread, And they came along when I was in

15:56.692 --> 16:11.611
high school or there, and they said, now the white 
bread, they've taken all the menu and the stuff out

15:56.692 --> 16:11.611
of it. They knew they'd milled it all out. And so 
then they said, well, you've got to have whole

16:15.056 --> 16:18.801
wheat bread. So I had the whole wheat bread. When I 
went to... Around high school, I'd take my lunch

16:25.261 --> 16:31.207
with me.

16:31.627 --> 16:33.769
Whole wheat bread all the time. Now, you didn't 
bring your lunch while you were at A&M. You didn't

16:38.414 --> 16:40.075
bring your lunch to the campus. You went back home 
to eat lunch every day? One of us was going back home

16:43.959 --> 16:48.804
all the time. Was there, that freshman year, did 
you have some teachers, some instructors that

16:48.824 --> 16:54.930
were important to you? Some that you, who? In the 
math department, his name was Martin. What made

17:05.932 --> 17:07.013
him special? He taught me how to handle balls.

17:15.046 --> 17:21.215
Well, it's just plain old arithmetic.

17:22.437 --> 17:25.221
You know, he'd ask you, multiply this 13 times this 
number here and how would you go about it so you

17:25.825 --> 17:36.119
wouldn't, you could do it in your brain. He did a lot 
more than that than anybody I ever saw. Who did you

17:42.768 --> 17:45.692
turn to for academic advice? Dad. Dad? Dad. Did he 
give you any guidelines? Oh yeah. When he said one

17:55.508 --> 17:59.833
day, he says, son, you're going to be in this. I was 
teaching at Tarleton. You're going to be in this

18:02.376 --> 18:04.699
business. You've got to get your master's degree. 
And I knew exactly where I was going.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.530
I would stay in college. And so I went up there, and 
they got me

18:15.872 --> 18:24.942
with a Well, a fellowship with a steel company. And 
we were studying the penetration of steel roof,

18:32.056 --> 18:40.382
the heat penetration of steel roof. I built some 
houses out there.

18:48.331 --> 18:49.913
I did the whole works. I got a whole thesis on it, but 
it was tough. It's not like it is today. Back to your

18:58.040 --> 19:02.144
freshman year, where did you all have Yale 
practice? Off the steps of the YMCA. Was there a

19:08.129 --> 19:10.251
midnight Yale practice then? But did they also 
have other Yale practices? Did you have more than

19:15.062 --> 19:16.263
one a week? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they would have 
several.

19:25.916 --> 19:28.560
But there was not a Yale practice held in the 
stadium?

19:31.263 --> 19:32.505
Not until later years. See, that stadium wasn't 
built until 29. Yeah. All that was there before 29,

19:37.349 --> 19:51.789
there was a set of steel bleachers and then a 
football field. And that football field was not

19:51.809 --> 19:54.292
drained. And what happened was that if you played 
on it a little while, the last 20 yards would be

20:02.189 --> 20:07.837
nothing but a mud hole. Where you can. So they came 
to dad. He wrote, he has a book on land drainage and

20:11.142 --> 20:19.053
reclamation.

20:20.736 --> 20:29.468
And

20:20.736 --> 20:29.468
so they came to him and they said, can you drain that 
field? And he said, yes. And so they said, you go

20:32.159 --> 20:36.623
over there, and you go. And so he went to work at it. 
But Dad was one of them that had his men around him,

20:44.511 --> 20:53.579
that he knew what they could do. And so I think it was 
Altamira that he used. Anyways, a student went

21:00.931 --> 21:06.237
over there and was working at it, laying it all out. 
And the official from Adelaide Republic said,

21:07.399 --> 21:13.286
well, I thought you were going to do this. That 
student knows as much about it as I do. They were

21:17.771 --> 21:21.116
paying him 75 cents an hour. They paid that 
student. That was good paying those years. That

21:25.641 --> 21:27.023
was excellent. Yes. So you understand? That's one 
thing.

21:36.167 --> 21:49.781
Did you say that after the stadium was built, after 
Kyle Field Stadium was built in 29, did they start

21:36.167 --> 21:49.781
having Yale practice over there the night before a 
game? They could have. They used it that way when

21:52.324 --> 21:57.790
they were closed in. They actually had... They 
used it for several,

22:01.883 --> 22:10.395
where they had concerts.

22:12.839 --> 22:17.165
Bob Hope was there in a concert. And

22:17.946 --> 22:26.939
we had a woman here who was, she had a voice like you 
wouldn't believe. Kate Smith? What? Kate Smith?

22:30.048 --> 22:32.230
God Bless America, Kate Smith? No, I'm talking 
about a person. Oh, oh. One right here. Oh. Oh. One

22:36.415 --> 22:38.477
of the Butler girls. One of the Butler wives. I can 
still hear him up there on that stage. And she was

22:46.045 --> 22:50.330
there, and she was there. Man, she could sing. And 
so he didn't do anything, but but just tease the

23:00.136 --> 23:04.642
crowd. And he said, do you believe she can do that? 
So she would sing another song. And that went on for

23:14.956 --> 23:19.142
a couple hours. I mean, Bob Hope right there, we 
paid him good money. Of course, he had some ad libs

23:25.331 --> 23:29.957
in between and all that, you know. It was a real good 
show. Do you remember when you first went to Silver

23:33.044 --> 23:35.788
Taps? No. Did you go to Silver Taps when you were a 
little kid? No. Was it held then? I don't think so.

23:46.424 --> 23:54.696
They might have held it in the context of the 
military. but it wasn't every time. Do you

23:58.839 --> 24:01.662
remember going to silver taps then after you were 
in the Corps? No, I never ever went to silver taps. I

24:07.648 --> 24:14.836
know they do it now and that sort of thing, but I 
never did. When you were a fish, did you have to

24:16.558 --> 24:20.702
polish sully? Was that tradition around then? Oh, 
yeah, but you know what happened to Sully, don't

24:25.034 --> 24:28.460
you?

24:33.388 --> 24:41.241
Well, when he was moved, that statue was moved up 
from the, it came on the railroad. It moved

24:42.282 --> 24:51.177
straight up that road in there, and they were 
getting ready to set him on the, on that, uh, uh,

24:56.101 --> 24:56.642
Pedestal? Yeah, pedestal.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.648
It's not marble. It's the other...

25:02.668 --> 25:09.556
Oh, boy. Yeah, it's not marble. It's a pedestal 
made out of rock and ground. Granite? Granite. He

25:23.552 --> 25:24.353
was sitting there. And it was the night before 
Easter.

25:34.514 --> 25:43.083
When the Corps went into Guy Hall, Sully was behind 
the poker.

25:45.866 --> 25:46.687
Did you see that? No, I didn't before I was there. 
About when was that? That was probably whenever

25:51.452 --> 25:55.116
that thing was moved in there. But when would that 
have been? I would say it was about 1916 or

25:57.688 --> 26:01.656
something like that. Okay. Now, how far back does 
Guyon Hall go? When was it built? Do you remember?

26:08.990 --> 26:10.934
It was one of the first that was around. There was 
several other buildings there that were chapels.

26:15.884 --> 26:16.024
Mm-hmm. one where Hart,

26:16.612 --> 26:26.621
we used it for a gun, a shooting gallery. And I 
remember that because,

26:26.641 --> 26:38.572
but the trouble they had with Guyon Hall was that 
the back end fell off of it. Now, was Guyon Hall here

26:39.933 --> 26:42.316
when y'all moved here? Well, it was. It was here. 
They didn't have that trouble then, but later on

26:46.480 --> 26:51.187
they did. They had to go jack that thing back up 
again. And nobody knew how Sully happened to be

26:54.992 --> 26:59.418
moved over? No, when the Corps did something like 
that, you never found out how it was. And there

27:04.726 --> 27:06.248
wasn't any use to try. Do you remember going to 
Muster, Aggie Muster, April 21st? When you were a

27:15.607 --> 27:18.412
fish, did you help with bonfire? Yes. Describe. 
Except that, yeah, I helped with a little bit. How

27:29.191 --> 27:31.114
long did y'all work on bonfire then? How long did it 
take? Well, you see, bonfire, as we know it today,

27:41.189 --> 27:42.290
It was not that. The bonfire was nothing but 
crating. Now that I know. And the reason you don't

27:46.815 --> 28:00.849
know is that we had to use those same trees that 
they're putting in the bonfire for our fuel, for

27:46.815 --> 28:00.849
cooking, and heating the house. And to burn up the 
crating and all the other trash, everybody was

28:02.190 --> 28:09.237
glad to get rid of it. Yeah. Am I correct that people 
would put their stuff out in the front for y'all

28:10.535 --> 28:15.421
to... I don't remember anything about that. I 
don't remember anything about that. But I do know

28:19.746 --> 28:28.456
that they carried it off down there near the Old 
Britain's Tower. They moved that big stone for

28:29.297 --> 28:32.340
the... World War II. They moved it off of where the 
home was at the time and they had it right in there.

28:42.083 --> 29:02.040
What they were concerned with was they had those 
three houses over there where Dr. Dean Kyle and

28:42.083 --> 29:02.040
let's see, Dean Kyle and Dr. Marsteller and

28:42.083 --> 29:02.040
the house doctor, whatever he was. They were 
concerned about that. Now, am I correct also that

29:08.426 --> 29:20.848
quite often they used the railroad push carts, 
those flat carts to carry the trash? I would

29:22.832 --> 29:23.874
imagine so. They were used for everything. And how 
long did it take for y'all to get all that stuff? Was

29:31.281 --> 29:34.366
it three months or two weekends or what? Well, I 
think they just had a pile out there that they were

29:35.768 --> 29:40.136
building on all the time. I mean, and they just kept 
it there, and they just finally, everybody would

29:41.838 --> 29:52.075
pitch in and give a little bit, and that's what, 
that's the way it went. And about how many people

29:55.878 --> 29:58.760
came to Bonfire? Oh, the whole thing, you know, the 
Corps came. Did, did your family come over? Did

30:03.445 --> 30:05.427
everybody in the community come over? We, yeah, we 
went out there and looked at it. And even, you know,

30:09.711 --> 30:21.943
when it was over on the, the big ones over in, on 
Simpson Field, they had some pretty good-sized

30:09.711 --> 30:21.943
ones over there that were actually trees. And then 
I think they did damage the roof, I understand, on

30:22.312 --> 30:34.668
the Memorial Student Center one night. But am I 
correct that until World War II, there were not

30:35.129 --> 30:46.564
trees, logs, it was the packing material and 
rubbish? No, I would say even before that, before

30:47.033 --> 30:52.499
they could use trees. See, the thing that you've 
got to remember is that gas came in here in 1928.

30:58.205 --> 31:00.507
That changed the whole thing up. Okay, okay. See, 
because before that, when we lived up on the campus

31:03.150 --> 31:15.403
from 1919 to 1924, it was common for Dad to get 15 
cords of wood back of that house And then they had to

31:15.738 --> 31:22.486
have a guy come in there with a forged tractor with a 
big old saw on it and saw it up. I mean, the 18-inch

31:22.766 --> 31:35.681
length or 24-inch length, depending on how you 
wanted to fuel your fireplace or your... When the

31:35.741 --> 31:38.804
gas came in, well, it all walked out. I mean, we had 
in the Irish...
