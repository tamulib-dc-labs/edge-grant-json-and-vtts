WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:20.284
the

00:03.085 --> 00:20.284
day they were supposed to make the reactor, or 
trial reactor, go critical under the stands in

00:03.085 --> 00:20.284
Chicago, as a member of that team, while he came on 
to work in his normal time. But in his briefcase,

00:22.227 --> 00:29.375
they brought along a bottle of wine. So when they 
controls were withdrawn and the chain reaction in

00:32.482 --> 00:39.174
fact occurred. And it was shut down and everybody 
was elated of course because they had achieved a

00:40.216 --> 00:51.958
chain reaction, the first in the history of the 
world.

00:52.985 --> 00:59.855
Gene reached in his briefcase and he got the bottle 
of wine and he says, I think this warrants a

00:52.985 --> 00:59.855
celebration. So he passed the wine around and had a 
taste of wine there in the reactor under the stands

00:59.875 --> 01:09.650
in Chicago that day. Gene is a really wonderful 
person.

01:17.522 --> 01:21.388
I was wondering about your thoughts when Senator 
McCarthy again, went against Oppenheimer,

01:21.807 --> 01:28.657
maligned him.

01:31.561 --> 01:41.174
Well,

01:31.561 --> 01:41.174
that's a hard one.

01:44.078 --> 01:46.802
First, it hurts my pride to see whom I considered a 
knothead like McCarthy, able to call some man like

01:48.554 --> 02:02.087
Oppenheimer to task.

02:05.330 --> 02:10.175
That seems an injustice to me that I don't stomach 
very well.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.223
And of course I felt the same way with McCarthy's 
trial of Stevens, who was Secretary of the Army at

02:19.503 --> 02:24.469
that time. And Oppenheimer,

02:24.509 --> 02:37.905
as I said, left himself open for something like 
that. And of course McCarthy was going to take

02:39.868 --> 02:45.915
advantage of it, because that's what he was trying 
to prove. But I don't think that's the forum for it.

02:51.771 --> 02:54.634
I think it was the forum for it. I don't think it's 
the best interest of the nation for him to do it, and

02:54.654 --> 03:12.612
I don't think McCarthy is qualified to do it, even 
if Oppenheimer was guilty of it,

02:54.654 --> 03:12.612
which he may have been, as far as I know. Did the Air 
Force see Oppenheimer as a threat because he was

03:14.043 --> 03:22.873
against development of the H-bomb? No, not 
really, because Oppenheimer was not a pinnacle of

03:23.014 --> 03:27.839
his own on that.

03:31.323 --> 03:35.308
When the Air Force looked at that,

03:41.802 --> 03:59.378
more in the sense that these people had created 
something that they didn't know what to do with,

03:41.802 --> 03:59.378
and they wanted to keep the closet door closed just 
as long as they could do it. We said to ourselves, we

04:01.820 --> 04:09.447
can understand that desire, but we think it's 
unrealistic. And we think that the security

04:10.895 --> 04:21.993
interests of the United States dictate that we get 
busy. And we have to do it if we can convince the

04:22.013 --> 04:33.912
right people, even though the Oppenheimers and 
others don't agree. And we went on that basis. Was

04:38.587 --> 04:43.413
there friction when you worked for Oppenheimer 
because the Air Force took a different view than he

04:38.587 --> 04:43.413
did? No. Did he ever, did he ever sort of chide you or 
say anything cynical to you about the Air Force?

04:52.584 --> 04:52.804
No. Because he knew that your stand or his, the Air 
Force stand was different from his. Oh yes, he knew

04:58.170 --> 05:07.041
the Air Force stand was different from his and he 
knew mine individually was.

05:07.308 --> 05:16.418
as of the time the decision was made, Mr. Webster's 
position, who was my boss, was contrary to his.

05:21.644 --> 05:24.607
But no, he was never there. He didn't seem to let 
those things bother him at all. The fact that I was

05:31.635 --> 05:35.779
opposite to him on that And as soon as the President 
said, we're going to go ahead,

05:37.936 --> 05:48.367
well, he forgot about it. He got busy going ahead. 
Now, I can't be critical of anything he did after

05:51.129 --> 05:56.795
that insofar as keeping us from getting there. He 
went on and contributed his best knowledge, I

05:58.137 --> 06:05.344
think, to us.

06:06.809 --> 06:10.713
So I can't say that he held out. They did just a 
different tribute. I sometimes feel that most of

06:13.877 --> 06:26.951
those guys felt like they had to take that 
position, and they hoped the president would

06:13.877 --> 06:26.951
overrule them, and their conscience would be 
clear, and everything would be all right. Really,

06:26.971 --> 06:31.095
I don't say that specifically about Oppenheimer, 
but I mean, I think a number of them felt that way.

06:35.231 --> 06:37.135
And I think that's the reason they took the 
position. They had a pretty good idea Truman was

06:39.099 --> 06:44.350
gonna ride over it anyhow. He had decided to drop 
it, which was the hardest thing. Yeah, drop the

06:49.500 --> 06:51.244
bomb, exactly. Now let's get back to your job as air 
planner. And you said that the impact of the atomic

06:56.091 --> 07:06.442
bomb was one of the more significant aspects and 
was very significant and changed war plans. In

07:07.944 --> 07:12.169
what way?

07:12.329 --> 07:19.898
What I really meant was the advent of the atomic 
bomb changed one of the things that changed every

07:22.156 --> 07:30.348
war plan that you try to make, because you have to 
take account of something that had not existed

07:22.156 --> 07:30.348
before. Take account of it in terms of what you 
could do with it if you had it. And of course, we were

07:36.196 --> 07:39.161
planning to have it, because we were building it. 
And

07:41.063 --> 07:49.075
the effect on other forces that didn't have it.

07:58.268 --> 08:12.848
But in the U.S. Armed Forces, no one at the start had 
the capability to use it, except the Air Force and

07:58.268 --> 08:12.848
the form that it was in. We knew that was not a good 
form to have it in, so everybody wanted to get in a

08:14.290 --> 08:21.119
position to use it. That's the scramble for 
nuclear torpedoes, nuclear guns, nuclear

08:24.931 --> 08:41.913
propelled airplanes, nuclear V1s, V2s,

08:24.931 --> 08:41.913
all kinds of applications. Delivery systems. And 
we pursued all of those. Now, of course, the period

08:45.778 --> 08:52.947
from Potsdam in July of August 1945 down to the 
Fulton speech, the so-called Iron Curtain speech

08:53.821 --> 09:11.343
of Winston Churchill, which was in March of 1946, 
just a month or so after you assumed your position,

08:53.821 --> 09:11.343
was a period in which American foreign policy was 
changing rapidly toward the Soviet Union. We were

09:11.424 --> 09:15.148
becoming very disillusioned with what the 
Soviets were doing in Eastern Europe. And then a

09:15.208 --> 09:20.335
year after that, in March of 1947, we get the Truman 
Doctrine, I would think that sometime in 1946 the

09:21.125 --> 09:33.223
United States starts to develop

09:21.125 --> 09:33.223
plans to bomb the Soviet Union. Do you remember 
when that was? Well,

09:37.870 --> 09:48.246
war plans except for

09:51.719 --> 10:11.397
contingencies like scrambles in the Middle East, 
things like that, all

09:51.719 --> 10:11.397
involved the Soviet Union because it was the only 
potential adversary that there was. And

10:11.597 --> 10:20.545
so we as air planters began to to use them in our 
plans just as fast as they were available.

10:26.263 --> 10:33.213
Probably a little faster, as a matter of fact, 
because not all of us knew how many was available or

10:26.263 --> 10:33.213
when.

10:37.119 --> 10:38.861
How many bombs were available. Yes. Of course, 
that's all you had. There wasn't a question of it.

10:42.647 --> 10:45.090
What about as far as Soviet targets? What were the 
major targets back then? I wonder if those have

10:47.794 --> 10:49.857
changed over the years. Well, Soviet targets have 
changed, of course, almost directly as the

10:50.343 --> 11:06.811
numbers increase, because you can achieve, have a 
lot more flexibility and achieve an objective by

10:50.343 --> 11:06.811
doing that.

11:09.976 --> 11:15.405
To say that there was a target list in which things 
were targeted that early would be an error. They

11:20.014 --> 11:20.815
won. When did we get a list like that, do you think? 
Well, I can't answer specifically, but it was

11:24.280 --> 11:36.498
after we had a significant number of missiles 
capable of reaching it, which was a good many years

11:24.280 --> 11:36.498
later than this. Sure, absolutely.

11:41.187 --> 11:47.254
I was well out of the planning business long before 
that happened. Although of course we were,

11:47.274 --> 12:00.190
we were planning targets even then, but not 
targeting is when there is a difference. It takes

12:00.210 --> 12:09.000
years and years to build the information 
necessary to do a target system. you gotta know

12:10.634 --> 12:14.319
what's there and that isn't so easy. Right, 
absolutely.

12:18.425 --> 12:23.072
And the nature of it and whether you can, what it 
takes to destroy it. And were you involved with

12:23.092 --> 12:27.658
those targets within Russia? Picking out which 
targets should be hit in case of a war or how many,

12:29.341 --> 12:38.734
well at that time all we had was B-29s, how many 
B-29s should go? Oh yes, all of these things have to

12:39.220 --> 12:43.004
be included in every war plan.

12:51.172 --> 12:52.954
The answer is yes. Okay. There was another thing 
that I was interested in, and that was increasing

12:56.357 --> 13:03.945
American British relations after the war. I've 
done some research in this and it appeared that

13:07.165 --> 13:23.200
right after the war, in the fall of 1945, Americans 
were not so concerned with continuing the joint

13:07.165 --> 13:23.200
relationship that we had in Europe, especially 
with the British, which was so very close. We

13:23.787 --> 13:36.767
weren't so concerned until 1946 when we realized 
that the Soviet Union was our new number one enemy,

13:23.787 --> 13:36.767
and relations improved rapidly. Did you find that 
relations improved as far as the Royal Air Force

13:37.372 --> 13:45.590
and the American Air Force throughout 1946? Yes, 
it improved between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and

13:45.870 --> 13:56.072
the British Chiefs of Staff, which is where I was. 
The planning groups of the two entities met, I know

13:57.368 --> 14:09.685
I don't start to say regularly, that isn't quite 
right, but quite often. Every week or so? No, every

14:10.907 --> 14:15.674
month or so. And

14:15.694 --> 14:23.865
would pursue various aspects of joint And

14:24.605 --> 14:31.536
toward the Soviet Union for the most part. Yes. Oh, 
yes. Essentially all of it. But it's more

14:36.123 --> 14:42.212
examining what are the capabilities to do this or 
what are the capabilities to do that. I'm sure

14:42.934 --> 14:48.402
individually we integrated those into our own 
plans back here. But we didn't sit down with the

14:49.057 --> 15:06.641
British and make a joint, or combined it would be in 
this case, plan for any kind of offensive action

14:49.057 --> 15:06.641
against the Soviet Union. But was it understood 
that in case of some sort of crisis then it would be a

15:06.661 --> 15:14.912
joint action? Well, yes, and there were a lot of 
joint things going on. We still had forces in

15:19.918 --> 15:24.043
England, air forces. Actually, I guess still 
have. We did for a monument many years after that.

15:31.332 --> 15:37.719
And so there was concerted plans for employment of 
those forces. And if you employ a party of forces,

15:38.720 --> 15:44.207
while the others have sure got to be in that stint. 
Now did the British have an office right in the

15:44.609 --> 15:48.034
Pentagon?

15:53.462 --> 15:55.125
I don't know about the Pentagon. The Joint Chiefs 
of Staff at that time were over where the State

15:55.145 --> 16:09.267
Department headquarters is now, and there were 
two British missions here in Washington. I'm not

16:10.769 --> 16:13.553
sure if they were in either of those buildings, but 
They

16:14.225 --> 16:26.818
were in the British Embassy and in buildings 
leased by the British Embassy. So they were always

16:26.838 --> 16:28.239
close at hand. Yes, they were in Washington, 
although to my memory they were not in that

16:28.680 --> 16:34.886
building. I don't remember their being there. Now 
in August, September of 1946, Field Marshal

16:37.949 --> 16:43.455
Montgomery visited Washington, D.C. and he had 
been in Canada talking to their military men and

16:44.178 --> 16:56.553
then he came down to Washington and talked to 
Admiral Leahy and some of our Joint Chiefs of

16:44.178 --> 16:56.553
Staff. As a matter of fact, they all took a trip down 
to the Potomac and it was supposed to be a social

16:57.053 --> 17:06.945
occasion, but they all talked about joint forces. 
Did you remember when he came? Were you at all

17:09.203 --> 17:10.467
involved? I remember when he came but I wasn't 
involved at all and I didn't see him. I didn't

17:15.481 --> 17:22.200
prepare any positions for anybody for that 
meeting and so I it's just a point in history for me,

17:23.024 --> 17:26.850
I just don't know. Okay. Of course another thing 
was increased defense relations with the

17:28.032 --> 17:36.325
Canadians, which eventually led to the 
establishment of the Dew Line. Yes, and the North

17:36.345 --> 17:38.628
American Air Defense Command. Yeah. Did you have 
any dealings with that? Well, no, not

17:42.093 --> 17:46.781
really. We had a The concept of the due line and all 
was prepared primarily by the Joint Strategic

17:51.205 --> 17:59.576
Survey Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At 
the time we were working with them and we worked on

17:59.716 --> 18:07.166
various pieces of that total. But they carried the 
ball and

18:08.027 --> 18:15.857
so we didn't have too much to do with it. And after it 
was once accepted, Well then even the Joint Staff

18:19.302 --> 18:22.085
didn't have much to do with it. It was taken care of 
by the Air Force and carried out. I was in

18:26.589 --> 18:35.297
Washington for nearly 20 years and I was not in the 
Air Force any of that 20 years. I was in the Joint

18:36.498 --> 18:46.727
Staff or something having to do with the atomic 
energy business or answering to the Secretary of

18:36.498 --> 18:46.727
Defense all those years in there. Air Force 
representative, but never was in the Air Force.

18:53.274 --> 19:08.932
Even my last job as commander of the Joint Task 
Force 7, I was responsible to the Joint Chiefs of

18:53.274 --> 19:08.932
Staff on the one hand, and to the commissioners of 
the Atomic Energy Commission on the other. So

19:09.973 --> 19:12.276
still wasn't in the Air Force.

19:14.602 --> 19:30.711
During 1946 and 1947, one of the major 
battlefronts was Greece, and of course the Civil

19:14.602 --> 19:30.711
War in Greece, and that led to the rise of the Truman 
Doctrine. I was wondering if you as air planner had

19:30.752 --> 19:38.145
anything to do with helping the Greeks, helping 
the government there, giving them air supplies,

19:38.412 --> 19:46.263
helping them in any way train men. I know they did 
send some Greeks over here to become pilots. They

19:51.510 --> 19:52.171
did. And so far as the Joint Staff was concerned, 
that again was a Joint Strategic Survey paper. And

20:02.165 --> 20:04.909
then they The actions were carried out by the 
executive agent, which I guess would have been

20:05.615 --> 20:12.662
Navy in that case. And I didn't have anything to do 
with it. I had a little bit to do with getting the

20:16.867 --> 20:26.537
papers ready for the president to look at and 
finally approve. But it wasn't substantive. I

20:31.482 --> 20:34.305
didn't make a bunch of the decisions that went into 
it. Of course, in the White House at this time was

20:35.703 --> 20:38.046
Admiral Light. You must have met him. Yeah. Can you 
describe that man? Could you describe him? I've

20:43.974 --> 20:50.363
read his memoirs and read his personal papers and 
I'd just like to have someone who knew him talk

20:43.974 --> 20:50.363
about him. Well, I don't know him that well. I 
thought he was a wonderful gentleman, as far as I

20:54.068 --> 20:58.774
was concerned, and a damn good naval officer. He 
could see both sides of the picture and did and he

20:59.750 --> 21:18.915
weren't automatically no damn good if you had 
something besides a Navy uniform

20:59.750 --> 21:18.915
on, which was not the case with some others of them I 
could mention. So, I just thought he was a fine man,

21:20.637 --> 21:27.546
a fine officer and I really don't have a a good 
evaluation of his capability that I don't have a

21:28.319 --> 21:36.319
firm opinion about. I liked him very much, but that 
was about all I knew about him. Another man of

21:41.667 --> 21:43.870
course is Harry Truman. You've met the President 
and I knew that I've talked to a number of diplomats

21:44.190 --> 22:03.372
who are at the State Department or on duty during 
the Truman period and by the State Department it

21:44.190 --> 22:03.372
seems to me unanimously thought he was an 
excellent President because he gave so much Well,

22:03.993 --> 22:10.904
because of the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall 
Plan, and because he gave the department itself so

22:03.993 --> 22:10.904
much responsibility. How did the Air Force feel? 
The Air Force felt that he was a

22:13.127 --> 22:23.183
very good person, too.

22:23.433 --> 22:33.864
I think any president would have had a hard time 
untangling all of the goddamn problems that were

22:23.433 --> 22:33.864
presented to him by defense at that time, by the 
three services, I should say. And what most

22:35.246 --> 22:50.402
presidents would feel like, I suspect, is 
grabbing them all free by the scuff of the neck and

22:35.246 --> 22:50.402
kicking the seat of their britches and telling 
them to go take care of their own marble.

22:50.703 --> 23:20.119
I think the Air Force had a very great deal of 
respect for his views and I think he treated them

22:50.703 --> 23:20.119
well and he did make the decision that was critical 
to

22:50.703 --> 23:20.119
him that related to that Beat 36 controversy and 
more importantly to the primacy and the

22:50.703 --> 23:20.119
intercontinental ballistic missile area. they 
thought a great deal of. My contact with him was on

23:23.647 --> 23:29.917
atomic matter rather than than military matter. 
And

23:31.499 --> 23:42.376
I thought he was wonderful because he could make 
decisions and he'd make them stick. And it didn't

23:43.738 --> 23:48.165
make too goddamn much difference to him 
apparently whether Joe Blow really thought it was

23:49.327 --> 23:53.453
a great deal or not. He thought it was the way it 
ought to be, why he'd do it. And that's what you

23:57.379 --> 23:58.500
needed. God, I'd rather see a wrong decision than 
no damn decision.

24:11.519 --> 24:17.528
So I thought he was a quite great president in terms 
of not only the substance of the policies that he

24:18.503 --> 24:27.293
put out, but by the manner of getting there and the 
manner of implementing it. I think it was too bad

24:27.313 --> 24:41.169
that he was shoved so quickly into the Potsdam 
situation, because I think with a bit of time and

24:27.313 --> 24:41.169
education, he could have probably done a better 
job than he did there. Boy, I sure can't blame him

24:42.130 --> 24:47.076
for it, but he just didn't have a chance. He was new 
to this scene. And he did have some hangers around

24:48.786 --> 25:03.021
like Averell Harriman and a few others that I 
wouldn't want to depend on their advice, but he

24:48.786 --> 25:03.021
didn't have any other, any other place to go for it. 
And why do you say that about Harriman? I just

25:05.964 --> 25:13.332
don't, I just don't buy his approach, that's all.

25:13.352 --> 25:16.455
I think he saw the Russians as they were so 
different than I see them.

25:19.490 --> 25:25.998
He saw them as someone we would live with and get 
along all right with. I don't see that. OK. Now, as

25:28.981 --> 25:42.777
far as being in Washington as the air planner, I've 
talked to your office with the Joint Chiefs of

25:28.981 --> 25:42.777
Staff was either at the old State Department 
building or in the Pentagon. Is that not right?

25:43.638 --> 25:43.859
Yes. Both. Both. Now, I've talked to a number of 
officers Many of them were at the Pentagon from

25:48.970 --> 25:56.683
major to brigadier general and somewhere in 
there. And they've always said that working in

25:57.625 --> 26:04.656
Washington, the schedules are just absolutely 
incredible. A lot of long hours and seven days a

26:05.578 --> 26:08.723
week. Is that what you found? Could you describe 
your daily routine for me? Yes, on the joint staff.

26:15.717 --> 26:20.444
There was always, of course, a lot more work than 
could be accomplished. And we did the best we

26:20.724 --> 26:23.428
could. But if there was some problem with some 
urgency, you stayed there until you got it out. And

26:31.980 --> 26:42.214
I have been in boat building, in the Pentagon in 
particular, for 72 hours at a time, many times.

26:42.970 --> 26:53.688
until we could get out a war plan or get out a plan to 
meet some other problem that the Joint Chiefs had

26:42.970 --> 26:53.688
referred to us. And you just work until you get it 
done. Doesn't make a damn whether it's five

26:58.235 --> 27:02.623
o'clock or midnight. That's the same thing I 
heard. And the Joint Staff is not the only place

27:07.203 --> 27:11.629
that happens. It happens in lots of places around 
here. In the Atomic Energy Commission, my hours

27:15.473 --> 27:20.780
were mighty long. Usually in the office by 7 and 
I'll sort them ever out by 10. Sometimes a damn cent

27:27.409 --> 27:29.311
later than that. I said, it's a killer. After 20 
years, you've got enough of it. That got me against

27:37.616 --> 27:39.218
Dubai a bit. Now I was wondering about another 
thing. Did you say before that you had been

27:43.423 --> 27:48.469
court-martialed or almost court-martialed 
twice? Or are you kidding me? Yes.

28:01.355 --> 28:11.625
It's stretching the point a little bit as an 
individual to say that in connection with the Air

28:01.355 --> 28:11.625
Force trying to get loose. All of us were on a 
mission out of Hamilton Field and went out to sea to

28:11.645 --> 28:23.716
intercept a Navy ship that was coming in from the 
Philippines. When was

28:24.297 --> 28:28.481
this? In 37.

28:32.776 --> 28:43.071
At that time, the Air Force was confined to the 
three-mile limit, mission-wise.

28:43.091 --> 28:45.114
We felt we had to break out of that. If the Navy could 
keep us confined to the three-mile limit, it

28:45.835 --> 28:53.366
dictated the kind of airplanes we needed, 
everything. And people didn't think we could go

28:53.707 --> 28:59.475
out. a side of land because we'd get lost or some 
damn thing.

29:06.596 --> 29:11.641
And we wanted to show that we could and that we could 
do something when we got out there. So we vetted out

29:13.743 --> 29:26.695
and went out, I think it was six hundred miles, 
quite a way, over the ocean in a land airplane and

29:13.743 --> 29:26.695
dropped a slick, a bucket of aluminum powder got 
near this thing and bombed it and turned around and

29:27.991 --> 29:32.276
came back home.

29:37.221 --> 29:40.504
The Secretary of War knew all about this by the time 
we got home. And the commander of that flight was

29:42.487 --> 29:47.472
already ordered to Washington before he landed. 
And

29:49.554 --> 29:55.821
it looked like the whole damn bunch of us were going 
to be court-martialed.

30:00.070 --> 30:09.462
It got taken care of in a rational way, so it's not 
quite fair to say it almost got court-martialed.

30:09.582 --> 30:26.023
The idea was the same, because it was a 
court-martialable offense

30:09.582 --> 30:26.023
to fly past the three-mile limit, you see. This is 
what it all boils back down to in terms of

30:26.484 --> 30:29.908
emissions. And that just had to be changed. So that 
was the first of four or five attempts before we got

30:35.328 --> 30:42.436
it changed. And it

30:43.356 --> 30:51.665
really never got formally changed. It just people 
shut up about it, and we went on better than

30:51.745 --> 30:59.153
it was. As the war got closer, 37, you see, is not 
very far from the time things were beginning to get

31:00.635 --> 31:09.749
pretty hot.

31:13.094 --> 31:24.972
The mission off-coast, which was a follow-up on 
this, when we were authorized to go out and

31:13.094 --> 31:24.972
intercept the Navy ship.

31:28.343 --> 31:32.328
and we had the worst goddamn weather you can think 
of.

31:35.612 --> 31:46.324
And the Navy gave us the wrong information on the 
ship, unless that really kind of famous one where

31:35.612 --> 31:46.324
LeMay was the navigator. And he took the outfit out 
and found a damn thing anyhow and bombed it. After

31:55.782 --> 32:07.614
that, I don't know, people just kind of shut up and 
got busy and got on and we built the airplanes to do

31:55.782 --> 32:07.614
what we thought they ought to do.

32:11.378 --> 32:21.348
The story of LeMay is written up in many places and

32:11.378 --> 32:21.348
damps out more accurately than I could tell it. I 
wasn't there anyhow. I was

32:23.778 --> 32:30.868
wondering about that other time that you were 
almost court-martialed, too. When was that?

32:33.031 --> 32:37.056
Well, that doesn't have anything to do with the Air 
Force. Oh, it has to do with the? The State

32:38.959 --> 32:41.041
Department. Oh, are you going to tell me that one? I 
was, when I left Panama I went to Central America as

32:48.517 --> 32:57.689
an assistant military attache for air to Central 
America and Columbia. And after a year about in

33:00.052 --> 33:10.947
Central America and San Jose, my area was divided 
into three districts, three, two more attachés,

33:12.513 --> 33:19.463
and I moved to Columbia, to Bogota. And Spurl 
Braden was the ambassador, American ambassador

33:21.426 --> 33:27.095
down there.

33:34.245 --> 33:41.997
Things were getting

33:34.245 --> 33:41.997
pretty warm because that was in

33:45.014 --> 33:52.623
December 40 or January 41, I don't remember now 
which, but right at the beginning of 41.

33:55.426 --> 33:56.968
There were a lot of things to do. The Germans were 
still flying SCATTA down there. We were pressing

34:00.852 --> 34:14.127
Pan American to make necessary deals to take over 
SCATTA, and pressuring the Colombian government

34:00.852 --> 34:14.127
to

34:15.625 --> 34:27.038
to do it, and they finally did, but the damn woods 
were full of Germans down there, so everybody was

34:15.625 --> 34:27.038
worried about the Panama Canal and that. So I was 
pretty damn busy, and flying a lot of places. I flew

34:31.943 --> 34:39.952
one mission out of there at 2300 miles in an 
airplane that would only fly about 750. Oh yeah, we

34:40.773 --> 34:44.417
talked about that. But

34:44.549 --> 34:58.803
it was a, I'd take people from the office with me on 
my flights as photographers and other things.

35:01.405 --> 35:03.628
Most of them were men, one of them was a woman.

35:06.631 --> 35:10.995
And the ambassador decided there was something 
wrong with that. I never even figured out what he

35:11.015 --> 35:13.257
decided was wrong. But

35:15.194 --> 35:24.266
I was gone until I came to Washington. And when I got 
here, I found that he had preferred charges

35:24.286 --> 35:33.639
against me for carrying an unauthorized 
passenger. And since they were formal charges, it

35:34.981 --> 35:44.273
wasn't something he could just walk away from. And 
so I had to cancel my return to Columbia and stay in

35:44.692 --> 35:54.186
Washington and work like hell to get the thing 
handled. And I finally took an appointment with

35:54.206 --> 36:12.572
the Secretary of State,

35:54.206 --> 36:12.572
the gentleman from Tennessee,

35:54.206 --> 36:12.572
to get him taken care of. Cordell Hall. Yeah. My 
immediate boss, the military attache, Colonel

36:17.861 --> 36:27.053
Pate, was an old friend of his from Tennessee. And 
so when he saw my plight, we went to see Hall because

36:29.036 --> 36:42.154
Spurl Braden worked for him.

36:45.458 --> 36:48.301
We talked a few minutes, told him what the problem 
was. He looked out the window and said to my boss,

36:50.283 --> 37:01.754
Ben, have you been devoting the proper time to 
meditation recently?

37:04.737 --> 37:07.060
Colonel Pate said, yes, I think I have. And he said, 
well, you see you do that. Every man needs that. And

37:13.186 --> 37:13.866
we left. And I didn't hear more about it. He 
apparently was, that was my only contact with him,

37:17.909 --> 37:27.040
but he apparently was a wonderful man.

37:27.060 --> 37:31.425
How'd you get, how'd you shift into the atomic 
energy business? Well. Your next job starts to

37:35.549 --> 37:46.222
deal with that as military liaison committee, as a 
director of that committee to the U.S. Atomic

37:35.549 --> 37:46.222
Energy Commission. Why'd they shift you into 
that? The Air Force, of course, was kind of

37:49.297 --> 37:59.173
fighting for its life in the atomic side of the 
picture at that time, and all the other services

37:49.297 --> 37:59.173
were too. And the commission had just been born, 
actually it was two years old, and

38:16.904 --> 38:18.946
And it went back a little further. When I was here at 
A&M, I was in a, graduated as a chemical engineer.

38:27.036 --> 38:33.925
And I don't know whether it was just fourth or fifth 
class, maybe, of chemical engineers to come out of

38:27.036 --> 38:33.925
here. I'm not sure exactly where they were, but it 
was right there at the front someplace. While I was

38:40.753 --> 38:45.038
here, while I was in senior here, I had to have one 
special project.

38:52.003 --> 39:03.476
And being the ambitious type at that time, I 
decided I'd make that project an explanation of

38:52.003 --> 39:03.476
Einstein's theory of relativity. As long as 
nobody understood it, I don't think Einstein

39:04.998 --> 39:10.364
himself ever claimed he really did. Well, it 
shouldn't be any problem for me. Yes, that is very

39:16.118 --> 39:19.763
ambitious. I bet your professors had some raised 
eyebrows about that. Well, I noticed a number of

39:27.494 --> 39:31.419
them were on hand when I came to talk about it. All of 
these particular projects had to be presented to

39:33.562 --> 39:40.772
the head of the department, Dr. C.C. Hedges, the 
head of the Department of Chemistry at that time.

39:48.299 --> 39:53.084
And as I found out, he didn't know anything about it 
either, but I didn't enlighten him a hell of a lot.

39:53.104 --> 39:57.970
That's what it amounted to after an awful lot of 
work, and I busted my butt on it. And not only did I

39:59.431 --> 40:04.337
not understand it, you couldn't find anything on 
it that would help you. I just wasn't available, at

40:05.458 --> 40:10.143
least not in the resources around here. But I went 
on and talked about it anyway. I tried to block my

40:16.025 --> 40:19.289
way through, but I couldn't quite do that.

40:23.014 --> 40:29.822
Now, Hedges tried not to laugh, but there was such 
that he just couldn't really keep from laughing. I

40:31.244 --> 40:38.573
told myself at that time, God damn it, I will find 
out about it when I get to a place where I can.

40:42.383 --> 40:46.128
And so I did, as time went by. And when the atomic 
business came up, I thought it was something that I

40:46.168 --> 40:53.577
could understand. And if I understood it 
properly, I'd have a hell of a lot better rationale

40:53.797 --> 41:03.990
about something that I thought was going to change 
civilization.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.437
Change it maybe more radically than it has. and 
something that could be a really good force if

41:10.936 --> 41:16.062
applied there. So I wanted to be a part of that 
effort. And so I got busy and learned about

41:20.266 --> 41:25.131
it. And so as a member of the Joint Planning Group, I 
went to, as a representative of the Joint Chief, to

41:25.151 --> 41:38.766
the bikini test. And

41:40.163 --> 41:54.659
quite a bit of time in the technical aspects of not 
only the weapon but the effects and the tests and

41:40.163 --> 41:54.659
the layout. And of course you get immediately into 
the implications or force implications as soon as

41:54.679 --> 42:00.826
you get into those things. And so I just kept, went 
on from there. And when it came time to leave the

42:11.213 --> 42:12.996
joint staff.

42:15.961 --> 42:23.914
They asked me to go over there to the executive 
director of that committee, and I did.

42:27.039 --> 42:37.677
So you were self-educated then, basically, as far 
as— Yeah, and I lived with those guys, and I worked,

42:27.039 --> 42:37.677
and I studied the books, and I studied the history.

42:39.530 --> 42:51.161
brought myself up to date as to where we were in the 
atomic business, and then tried to keep abreast of

42:39.530 --> 42:51.161
it from there, straight on forward, and to know the 
people who were involved in it. Now as the military

42:52.162 --> 43:00.530
liaison, can you describe exactly what you did? 
Well, the Atomic Energy Act of 1947 placed all of

43:10.124 --> 43:19.096
the responsibility for atomic affairs under the 
Atomic Energy Commission.

43:22.962 --> 43:34.798
It recognized that there was a military use for 
this that had to be protected, but that

43:35.251 --> 43:44.907
temperature of the country and the people at that 
time was, for Christ's sakes, let's control this

43:35.251 --> 43:44.907
thing outside the military. and not ever give the 
military a means of using this without full

43:46.321 --> 43:56.932
control. As a matter of fact, they wanted to go 
further than that and follow the Baruch plan and

43:58.233 --> 44:11.586
fix it so even the United States couldn't do it, 
much less its military.

44:20.864 --> 44:40.658
They didn't know how to handle the Department of 
Defense, the things that have to go in there that

44:20.864 --> 44:40.658
didn't expect the Atomic Energy Commission to 
know exactly what kind of weapons that we want, or

44:20.864 --> 44:40.658
how did the military want it, how to determine how 
many of them were needed and what their

44:20.864 --> 44:40.658
characteristics would be and so forth. Yet they 
didn't want to deal directly with the military on

44:40.678 --> 44:44.745
the matter. So they formed a law provided for a 
committee as a liaison between defense and AEC and

44:45.772 --> 44:56.527
vice versa. And that committee was headed by a 
civilian chairman appointed by the president, I

44:58.409 --> 45:11.948
think with the advice and consent of the Senate, 
although I'm not sure about that last.

45:14.999 --> 45:21.869
It had a staff of people, military and civilian, 
who were full-time. And then the committee of it

45:22.910 --> 45:37.691
itself consisted of two officers from each of the 
three services, plus the civilian chairman, plus

45:22.910 --> 45:37.691
two representatives from somewhere else. And 
I've forgotten where they were. It wasn't

45:39.113 --> 45:40.855
significant, anyway.

45:44.834 --> 46:02.826
So we met, we the committee, met with the 
commission and relayed the needs and desires and

45:44.834 --> 46:02.826
whatnot of the Department of Defense to the 
commission as a basis for their action in the

45:44.834 --> 46:02.826
weapons business. This sounds kind of simple, but 
it's not really quite that simple because, for

46:05.219 --> 46:26.349
example, one of the first things that happened was

46:05.219 --> 46:26.349
a determination of how many weapons do you need in 
the long run. This is, of course, the biggest

46:26.369 --> 46:29.633
question that we're going to have. How many 
weapons do you need? Well, nobody knows, but...
