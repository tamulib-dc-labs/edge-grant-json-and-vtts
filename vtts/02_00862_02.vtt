WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:04.691
For the date when those men were killed? You're 
saying there were some men killed? Yes, they got

00:06.193 --> 00:09.918
killed at Texas Coal Mine. Yes, sir. How were they 
killed? Well, they say, you know, there was two

00:13.442 --> 00:19.069
mains of coal. One, the top main and the bottom 
main. And this elevator goes down to the bottom, of

00:23.254 --> 00:27.599
course. All right. And they claim... Because I was 
a communist, they had to get some way to excuse.

00:34.920 --> 00:48.656
They said that this man came out of the second vein, 
and he must have stuck his head here when the

00:34.920 --> 00:48.656
elevator was going down, and he knocked him down to 
the bottom and killed him. I see. So the elevator

00:48.817 --> 00:54.303
knocked him down to the bottom of the shaft, and 
that killed him? Uh-huh. So one man died in that

00:54.483 --> 00:55.544
accident? One man died in that accident, yeah. 
Were there any other accidents that you remember?

01:01.719 --> 01:06.946
Well,

01:01.719 --> 01:06.946
Jose Rios was his name. He got killed that way. Who 
was it? Jose. Jose? Jose Rios. Rios? Rios. Rios.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.721
R-I-O-S? R-I-O-S. Rios. Yes, sir. Jose Rios. Joe 
Rios. And... I don't remember what year it was.

01:35.255 --> 01:37.378
No, I don't remember. It was in the 20s, but I don't 
remember what year it was.

01:44.568 --> 01:53.400
Do you remember what was the basic food that the 
Mexican families ate, minors?

01:58.544 --> 01:59.785
Beans, I guess. Beans? Beans. Beans and potatoes, 
harsh potatoes. Harsh potatoes, beans, and rice,

02:08.014 --> 02:12.258
and such stuff as that. Where did the miners get the 
food? At the commissary. At the commissary. Yes.

02:19.746 --> 02:22.129
Yeah, they kept the stuff there at the commissary. 
Did they pay cash for that food, or did they just

02:22.269 --> 02:25.632
keep it on the books? No, they kept it on the books. 
And subtracted from the pay? Every two weeks, they

02:29.206 --> 02:35.292
said, well, Augustine's got so much coming. All 
right. How about his bills? Well, he's got a lot of

02:38.515 --> 02:40.417
bills here. Says Augustine's got $45 coming for 
two weeks or half a month. And he bought the

02:48.605 --> 02:50.607
grocers. $30 was the grocers. So he's got $50 left. 
And that's the way it was. He'd take home. No, the

02:59.058 --> 03:01.621
house rent come off of that. Did you, most of the 
time on payday, get some form of cash? Yeah, a

03:06.948 --> 03:08.690
little cash was. Well, were there any miners that 
were always in debt? Oh, yes, lots of them. Lots of

03:15.679 --> 03:16.480
them. Never see the dime. I see. Yeah, lots of them. 
No, it's just lots of them. Why was that? If there

03:24.190 --> 03:25.892
you were getting... getting money every payday, 
and yet they seem to be in debt. What was the

03:29.401 --> 03:31.123
difference between you and them? Well, you see, I 
was getting $90 a month, straight time. I see.

03:37.012 --> 03:46.887
While they had the coal digger, he had to go in, and 
what he, well, he got four acres, 25 cents a car, a

03:37.012 --> 03:46.887
ton. 25 cents a car. Uh-huh. If he loads four cars, 
he made $1. And maybe he walked a day, and maybe he

03:54.610 --> 04:00.237
put it to do, and he just left one car or two cars. So 
how much will it be in a week? Not very much. No.

04:05.303 --> 04:06.605
That's why they're staying dead. They don't know 
how to. I always been pretty careful myself. If I

04:11.992 --> 04:17.458
got a dollar in my pocket, I ain't going to spend a 
whole dollar, no, sir. I'm going to keep 50 cents in

04:17.478 --> 04:21.263
my pocket and spend 50 cents. I don't know what 
might happen tomorrow. I tell you, I went through

04:24.327 --> 04:27.412
this year of depression. And I mean, I know what 
that is. Yes, sir. What did you do during the

04:32.399 --> 04:34.202
depression? Well, I had to go back for work, and I 
worked 35 cents a day, cleaning toilets, whatever

04:34.222 --> 04:43.617
I could get. You see, I had a family to support. And I 
had work, and I had work for whatever I could get. I

04:50.347 --> 04:52.410
never had what kind of work. or how much you're 
going to pay me. All I want is to wait. When I got

04:55.491 --> 04:57.753
through that period, why didn't they want to? And I 
was glad to get that. I was doing it the first year.

05:03.999 --> 05:07.663
You need some water?

05:07.683 --> 05:09.004
No, thanks. You see, I had a stroke last September, 
and I kind of faked my throat, this whole side, my

05:09.024 --> 05:17.092
left side. This stroke got me. That's the reason I 
got that walk I keep. Can't put the weight on this

05:22.664 --> 05:24.326
one. It goes to shaking. Would you like to rest a few 
minutes? No, that's all right. I'm ready. I'm set.

05:31.316 --> 05:34.740
Yeah, it's all right. Okay. All right. What did the 
women do during the day? Who? What did the women do

05:40.728 --> 05:43.692
during the day? Stayed home. Stayed home? Stayed 
home. Stayed around or what? Just. Well, those

05:49.833 --> 05:53.477
that had children, I guess they stayed busy with 
the kids. See, they used to wash, they didn't have

05:54.699 --> 05:57.742
to wash in machines then. They had a tub and 
washboard. They had to wash on this washboard.

06:05.090 --> 06:08.214
They had no hot water heaters. They had a kettle. 
Kettle? Yeah, kettle. They had to heat the water,

06:11.278 --> 06:14.341
boiling water. And they stayed busy washing and 
cleaning up children. I guess. I don't know. I was

06:22.218 --> 06:23.780
at my work. I didn't know what the women do much. I 
know they didn't go around because they had no

06:27.124 --> 06:30.788
automobiles. Very few had a horse and buggy. Very 
few. I was lucky to have a horse and buggy. Well,

06:38.596 --> 06:40.638
that's a good problem because you saved your 
money. I had a horse and buggy. Yes, I had one. A

06:42.900 --> 06:44.762
pretty little mare. Gray mare. She was one of them. 
What do you call that? Peas? Yeah,

06:50.296 --> 07:13.063
I

06:50.296 --> 07:13.063
lost my voice since I had this stroke.

07:13.415 --> 07:17.040
You were 15 when you went into the mine. Yeah, 
right, yes. Did you know of anybody that was

07:18.042 --> 07:21.727
younger than that and was working in the mines? No, 
no. 15 was about the youngest. About the youngest.

07:25.132 --> 07:28.858
I don't remember any kids went down to mine besides 
me. Was it mostly the Mexican workers? Yes, yeah,

07:34.006 --> 07:36.630
most of them. Most of them, mostly, yeah. Did they 
all seem to get along with each other? Oh, yes, yes,

07:40.575 --> 07:42.358
they got along fine. Except for Saturday nights at 
the dentist, when they got drunk, they had fights.

07:50.883 --> 07:53.726
That was on the Texas Coal Company property, 
right? Yes, yes. Yeah, I guess the waitress at

07:55.868 --> 07:59.151
Johnson had the same trouble, I guess. I never did 
go around. I always stayed at my place.

08:10.537 --> 08:15.624
Were there any other accidents like boiler 
explosions or anything like that? No, no. Do you

08:18.487 --> 08:21.992
think mining was fairly safe there? Well, I think 
so. It was about as safe as they could have it. Well,

08:29.742 --> 08:30.603
let me ask you this. From the time that you had your 
accident until the time that you quit, did you see

08:30.663 --> 08:38.794
an improvement in the mining techniques? No, sir. 
None at all. Not at all. And I used to drive up and

08:41.762 --> 08:50.392
down this road and into the camps, take those 
people to town and bring them back. I never did it

08:51.213 --> 08:56.378
anymore,

08:51.213 --> 08:56.378
no. So they used mainly steam power and mule power. 
Yes. Steam, the mules would start to pull the, you

09:00.823 --> 09:09.012
see those anchories, they call it, they dig it all, 
half a mile long, and they'd have so many feet,

09:09.447 --> 09:20.797
they'd run what they call rooms one other way, and 
go so far away, they had to run back this other way.

09:21.378 --> 09:25.562
They had to leave big, thick pillars to support, 
you know. And these mules go over there and pull the

09:27.003 --> 09:38.914
cars from the end of the track like railroad, from 
the diggers to the cage. And then they put it on this

09:39.333 --> 09:41.895
cage. We call it a cage. It's like an elevator. They 
give me a signal. Then I hushed it up. And they had a

09:51.665 --> 09:52.746
tipple. I hushed it into the tipple. One cage goes 
down, one come up. If the car goes down, one load

10:00.733 --> 10:02.875
comes up. And it comes up to the tipple? Over the 
tipple, they had what they called a dumper. One man

10:08.476 --> 10:09.737
out there. This dumper would pull that car off the 
cage and dump it. Then they had to shoot that coal

10:15.845 --> 10:22.753
right into the railroad car. Right into the 
railroad. Right into the railroad car. Was there

10:26.797 --> 10:30.281
any dirt mixed in with the coal? Well, in some 
places they had little strips of dirt, but the

10:30.301 --> 10:36.829
dingo was supposed to throw that on the side. Then 
when he had enough to fill up a car, he'd fill up a car

10:37.332 --> 10:41.877
in dirt. He'd get so much for that. About ten cents, 
I think, he'd give a dime to load that car in dirt.

10:49.366 --> 10:54.812
Okay, well, how did you keep the number of cars per 
day? I mean, how did each miner know how many cars?

10:57.815 --> 11:02.681
Well, you see, each miner had his number. He had a 
number. He had a number, yeah, a bunch of checks.

11:06.965 --> 11:10.650
Washers, brass washers, they had their number on. 
For instance, I was number, say I was number 12. My

11:16.017 --> 11:18.079
check was on marked number 12. You was 14. Your 
check was on 14. Every time you load a car, you put

11:22.725 --> 11:26.050
that check on there. So when it comes to the top, 
that dump truck pulls that check off and hangs it on

11:27.411 --> 11:34.120
the board. All the 14s belongs to one man. All the 
12s belongs to another man. In that way. How many of

11:43.299 --> 11:46.442
these brass washers on the average? Hundreds of 
them. Hundreds of them. How many a day for one miner

11:49.204 --> 11:51.787
on the average? Well, they said they might give 
you, well, you wouldn't load over eight or nine

11:51.807 --> 11:58.092
cars a day. They said they might give you 12 or 15 
checks. Might give you 15 of these washers. And you

12:06.128 --> 12:08.932
keep them, you keep them so. So this dumper, at good 
times, he comes out with a boat, has days on it. And

12:18.105 --> 12:20.268
each day has his watches at that. Number 12, number 
10, number six, and number, everyone number now.

12:27.278 --> 12:32.886
And of course, at the store, they knew my name, they 
know what was my number there. And you number, and

12:33.267 --> 12:35.730
all the rest of them. And the dumper would come down 
with them checks and turn it over to the engineer,

12:36.723 --> 12:43.433
turn it over to me. So after I quit my agent work, I 
had to go and count these checks. I'd count all

12:50.062 --> 12:51.965
these checks. Then I'd call the office. Then I'd 
call Mr. Shrimp at the office and I'd tell him,

12:54.488 --> 13:04.182
number 14, 12, 12 checks, 12 cars. Number 
so-and-so, ten. Number so-and-so, six. Just how

13:09.827 --> 13:10.828
do you know it? He'd put it on the book. So you call 
him on the telephone? Over the telephone from the

13:14.092 --> 13:20.920
engine room to the office over there. And the 
office was at the mine? Yeah, at the store. Well,

13:25.365 --> 13:29.009
Augustine, did anybody ever dispute your county? 
Were there ever any arguments? Yeah, sometimes

13:31.052 --> 13:33.034
mistakes. Sometimes... The mistakes, maybe the 
double might drop a check. Or maybe they put two

13:38.157 --> 13:40.020
checks on one. And how were those disputes 
resolved? Well, whatever the stripper said,

13:43.545 --> 13:48.632
whatever the boss said, that's not so. You may say, 
Mr. Stripper, I'm too cautious. That's what the

13:53.940 --> 13:55.282
book shows. You can't pay for the book shows. 
That's all. There was no use to argue with them. No

14:02.051 --> 14:02.932
use to argue? No. I guess whatever he said, that was 
all. Did that happen very often? No, just once in a

14:08.807 --> 14:12.513
while, just once in a while. No, I had lots of work to 
do. I had to do that. Then I had to count the mine cars

14:15.377 --> 14:22.188
that were dumping each railroad car. Some of them, 
you know, they had 60,000 capacity. I was 80,000

14:28.678 --> 14:30.981
capacity. They all definitely come, you know, the 
railroad cars. Someone got more capacity than

14:33.886 --> 14:35.971
that. When I had to report so many pit cars in this, 
so many pit cars in this, so many pit cars in this,

14:36.613 --> 14:50.950
that the number of the car, of the railroad car, I 
had all that responsibility. I see. So you were

14:52.734 --> 14:56.480
pretty much a superintendent then? No, I was 
second to the superintendent. Okay. How did, if

15:00.265 --> 15:06.915
you did all this, you, well, and obviously now you 
speak English, where did you learn English? Out

15:06.935 --> 15:07.416
here? I never did go to school. You never did? No. 
You know, up in them days, we weren't allowed to go

15:10.160 --> 15:14.366
to white school. We weren't allowed even to go to 
the steps, because if I walked the steps of a white

15:14.887 --> 15:20.515
school, teacher comes, what do you want here? Go, 
you ain't got no business here, get away from here.

15:26.995 --> 15:27.997
They run me away. So I didn't get no education. Did 
the Texas Coal Company have a school? No, no,

15:33.706 --> 15:37.052
nobody had a school, no. I understand the Vogel 
Mines had a school. No. You don't remember that?

15:42.300 --> 15:43.603
No, they didn't have no school. Now his daughter, 
His old man's daughter. Gusta? Gusta. Gusta had

15:49.573 --> 15:50.654
school. We had to pay for it. Oh, I see. We had to pay 
her so much for each kid. No, we had daughters. My

16:01.330 --> 16:03.212
daughter had school. Nothing. Well, with Gusta's 
school, where was her school? There was a little

16:09.161 --> 16:11.204
house over there. That was what was kept. That was 
that. They came over there. And Mrs. Guster had a

16:15.616 --> 16:22.602
little room, a little house over there where she 
kept school. And finally, we got this schoolhouse

16:22.622 --> 16:26.846
over here on the right. For the Mexican people? 
Yes. And we had a teacher from Cameron. She'd come

16:35.294 --> 16:37.076
here and teach. That was paid by the state. Do you 
remember what year that was? Well...

16:45.562 --> 16:50.408
That was after we moved here, must have been in 24, I 
guess. Something like that. 1924, I betcha. Well,

16:54.774 --> 17:01.864
before that, in Augusta School, did she service 
other coal mine companies? No. Just the Vogel

17:02.545 --> 17:04.027
mine? No. Kids from here went over there. Kids from 
the Texas coal company went over to her school.

17:10.287 --> 17:11.929
Yeah, gee, we paid so much. Do you remember how much 
you paid? No, I don't remember. I didn't send mine

17:14.774 --> 17:16.577
over there, no. So your children didn't go to 
school? Not over there, no. But they did over to

17:20.883 --> 17:22.105
your school? Oh, yeah, you see, that top of the 
ridge right over there used to be got burned out. By

17:27.553 --> 17:30.758
the mine from here, that was top of the ridge 
school. But no Mexican kids over there, no. That's

17:33.382 --> 17:34.384
about whites. Oh, the Chapel Ridge School was for 
whites? Talbert Ridge. Talbert. Talbert.

17:40.962 --> 17:42.043
Talbert. Talbert Ridge. That's white school over 
there. I see. But no Mexicans. No, it wasn't

17:47.350 --> 17:49.172
allowed over there at all. But when the buses 
started to run, then we all got together. That all,

17:54.840 --> 17:57.543
the Mexicans just went with them. Mr., uh... Uh...

18:03.811 --> 18:07.876
Mr. Phillips' partner, Lucky, Mr. Lucky, Emmett 
Lucky. Emmett Lucky? Yeah. Mr. Emmett Lucky was

18:10.199 --> 18:14.885
the trustee, and he kind of got me to go with him. We 
went around and take lots of Mexican children to

18:15.686 --> 18:19.171
him. I said, what's the use of this? He said, they go 
to school. I said, why? He said, Rockdale. They go

18:25.199 --> 18:26.621
to school in Rockdale. There ain't going to be no 
more school outside the country. All of them got to

18:29.945 --> 18:31.607
go to Rockdale. Mine started to go to Rockdale. Do 
you remember when that was?

18:39.861 --> 18:42.784
Uh... Vera! Uh-huh?

18:46.607 --> 18:49.090
Do you remember when you started scooting to 
Rockdale? Oh,

18:50.071 --> 18:57.879
my God. Let's see, 1920 and 1927. 1927? Yeah. Well, 
about twenty-six or twenty-seven. In 1927, you,

19:03.147 --> 19:07.653
uh, the Mexican... Yeah, they got, they went, they 
got together then, yes. In Rockdale. In Rockdale.

19:08.814 --> 19:12.019
Now, before that, you had your own school, though. 
Well, yeah, we had to pay that, that was in the

19:12.039 --> 19:14.722
Spanish. Spanish school. We had a, yeah. Except 
the time that, uh, uh, Mrs. Vogel, Mrs., what was

19:17.225 --> 19:24.595
her name? Augusta. Mrs. Augusta. Yeah, right. 
Mrs. Augusta Vogel. She used to teach English. And

19:30.650 --> 19:37.019
there was this teacher came from Calvary City, but 
it didn't last long. They had them all go to

19:37.780 --> 19:40.504
Rockdale. They closed up that school over there, 
and all of them went to school to Rockdale. Okay,

19:46.012 --> 19:48.255
let me be sure I have this straight, okay, 
Augustine. We had a white school over at Talbot.

19:54.325 --> 19:55.246
Talbot Ridge. Talbot Ridge. Uh-huh. And then we 
had a Mexican school right up west of here, right?

20:02.593 --> 20:03.254
Yeah, yes. And that was about 1924, you said? Oh, 
1925, maybe. And that's the one that the state paid

20:08.279 --> 20:11.302
for? That's the teacher was coming from Denver, I 
guess, and the state paid her, yeah. Okay, all

20:15.226 --> 20:16.407
right. And then in 1927, all the students went to 
Rockdale. They went to Rockdale, yeah. I see. But

20:20.692 --> 20:22.413
mine is starting to go over there. I see. Did you 
have a church at the Texas Coal Company? No, we went

20:29.040 --> 20:31.705
to Rockdale Church. You went to a Rockdale Church? 
Catholic Church, yeah. Do you remember the name of

20:33.749 --> 20:35.052
that church? St. Joseph. St. Joseph? Yeah, St. 
Joseph. Still St. Joseph. Still go by that name. So

20:41.044 --> 20:42.287
you went there every Sunday? Every Sunday. And, of 
course, you went in your buggy. In the buggy. We

20:47.332 --> 20:48.473
used to go in the buggy. And after 19, after 20, we 
went in the car. I bought me a Model T. Right. Well,

20:56.621 --> 20:58.743
how did the other families get to church? Did they 
walk? Some of them walked. Some of them, I took

21:01.045 --> 21:01.946
them. I'd make three or four, five trips on Sunday. 
I used to charge two bits apiece, you know. And I'd

21:08.052 --> 21:09.033
load four. I made a dollar. Yeah. Take them back, a 
dollar, bring them back. Yeah. Was church a pretty

21:17.601 --> 21:21.128
strong factor in the mining camps? Well, kind of. 
Not too strong, no.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.812
They just went on Sundays then? Yes, on Sundays, 
yes, on Sundays. Do you remember any weddings? Oh,

21:41.479 --> 21:43.201
yes, they had a lot of weddings. Did they have them 
in Rockdale or did they have them at the mining? At

21:45.785 --> 21:48.088
the camps out here, yeah. Would the preacher or the 
minister come out? Yeah, he'd come out and marry,

21:49.971 --> 21:52.915
yes. Like myself, I was married at Texas. You were 
married at the Texas Coal Company? At Texas Coal

21:57.541 --> 21:59.083
Company, yes. The priest and the judge came up 
there and married. I was married by the judge

22:04.043 --> 22:05.986
first. I got my license, and then our folks wanted 
to be married by Catholics, you know. So I had the

22:12.815 --> 22:14.998
priest to come over from Taylor. The priest came 
from Taylor to marry us. Did you have to pay for you?

22:20.386 --> 22:20.686
Yes, sure. Do you remember how much you paid him? 
No, I think I gave him a $5 bill. Wow, that must have

22:25.553 --> 22:27.135
been a lot of money back then. I gave him a $5. He 
didn't charge me. Just give him whatever I wanted

22:29.959 --> 22:32.903
to give him, I'd give him a $5 bill. Did he do the 
service in Spanish or was it in English? Spanish.

22:39.157 --> 22:42.200
That was the priest. The judge, Mr. Ed Gunn, was the 
judge that married me. He said English. I see.

22:49.689 --> 22:51.291
Where did you meet your wife? Here. At the camp? At 
the camp? I had a buddy at the Texas Gold Company.

23:00.971 --> 23:03.154
Was she a daughter of another miner? No, she was a 
daughter. She had a mother and two brothers. There

23:07.960 --> 23:10.003
was two sisters and two brothers. They didn't have 
a father. I see. They came from Mexico. How did they

23:16.091 --> 23:17.953
end up in the mines? Did their brothers were 
working? Yeah, the brothers were working. There

23:20.737 --> 23:21.818
was gold miners. I see. So the family came up 
without a father? Yeah. They were with their

23:26.664 --> 23:27.966
brothers. I see. There was an old lady and two girls 
and two boys. And the two boys supported the two

23:33.212 --> 23:36.397
daughters and the mother? Yeah, they were 
working, yeah. Well, I said boys, that was me and

23:37.439 --> 23:40.623
grown men, but the young men.

23:43.628 --> 23:46.312
Do you ever sit back and think about the old mining 
days? No, sir. When you just sit back and think,

23:48.174 --> 23:50.578
what do you think about? I wish I had never seen the 
coal mine. Really? I do. But I get to think about my

23:55.089 --> 23:57.372
legs. Of course, I don't like to accident. There's 
a lot of times I lose legs and they don't, I don't

23:59.756 --> 24:04.262
want to be in wrecks. That could happen anywhere. 
But it might happen while I was working. I was in the

24:09.649 --> 24:10.811
mine. That's why I lost my legs. No, it's all right, 
but I would recommend it to, I don't want my kids to

24:20.343 --> 24:26.711
go back under the ground, 100 feet on the ground. 
Things got, they all learn trades today. They're

24:31.738 --> 24:35.183
not even thinking about going in the mine. Of 
course, they have a new way of mining now, you know.

24:39.969 --> 24:40.430
Yes. One of my boys working away at Alcoa. Alcoa. 
That's what he is. But he's working at Alcoa. He's

24:46.618 --> 24:48.240
not by this trip, but... I see. Yeah, they strip the 
coal now. But we used to go down the ground and

24:52.686 --> 24:55.390
undermine it. But they don't do that now. No, 
Edward, he works at Alcoa. He's a crane operator

25:01.557 --> 25:04.761
over there. I see. Does he live here? Yeah, he lives 
in town. In town. Yeah, he lives in town. Did he

25:12.751 --> 25:17.417
remember growing up in mines, around the mines? 
No, you remember he was grown up, he was raised

25:17.600 --> 25:32.981
right by the old house, between the end and Texas 
Coal Company, about a quarter of a mile back there.

25:33.061 --> 25:35.124
He was raised here. So he wasn't, didn't, doesn't 
know very much about the mines. He didn't know

25:38.609 --> 25:40.191
nothing about the mines. Not a thing, no. And you 
just assumed to be that way, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, he

25:45.562 --> 25:48.525
don't know nothing about mine. No, sir. You go to 
the STV, he says, I don't know. You don't know

25:54.511 --> 25:55.332
anything? He says, it's a hole down in the ground. 
He says, that's all.

26:01.978 --> 26:05.301
Yeah, he asked me, how do you take that mule down in 
the ground, Dad? I said, they put him in this cage.

26:07.984 --> 26:12.008
We had a sink made, and we settled on that anyway. 
And then we pushed that mule, and then he closed the

26:12.595 --> 26:19.401
gate, and somebody sat here on top holding the 
bridle. And then I let him down. After downing that

26:21.864 --> 26:26.468
one, he can't do nothing. Did they bring the mules 
up every night? Well, some places they did, some

26:29.191 --> 26:34.616
places they'd keep them there till they died. Oh, 
really? Yeah, I think that was wrong. We used to

26:38.259 --> 26:40.341
haze them every night. No, we hushed them out every 
night, let them down every morning. But after they

26:46.254 --> 26:49.977
went down, they just walked right on that gate. 
After the first two, three times, usually I'd push

26:49.997 --> 26:53.121
them. That man just walked, the driver just walked 
in that hole by the hauler, and that mule just

26:53.661 --> 27:00.168
walked right behind him. They closed that gate. 
Down they go. That's all. How did the miners and

27:05.794 --> 27:10.058
mules even get water down in the mines? They didn't 
drink no water. The miners take their jugs of

27:12.131 --> 27:14.315
water. But the mules didn't get no water until they 
come out at night. Now they eat no water until when

27:22.306 --> 27:27.513
they come out. Did the mules last pretty long in the 
mines? Yes, they lived a long time. Pretty strong

27:33.001 --> 27:33.862
animals. Yes, pretty strong. They get good feed. 
Feed them good. Yeah, it's pretty good out.

27:47.174 --> 27:50.077
Well, can you think of anything else that we've 
left out? About mining? Yeah, about the mining

27:53.400 --> 28:01.729
camps?

28:01.749 --> 28:04.352
No, they had dances and weddings. They had fights. 
They'd get drunk on Saturday nights. They gamble.

28:16.130 --> 28:17.332
Some of them put it quiet. Quiet? Some of them were? 
Yeah, quiet. They didn't mess around with the

28:20.978 --> 28:23.221
others. Didn't go to do games or that like that. I 
mean, gambling. Yeah. Let me ask you this. Any of

28:32.636 --> 28:36.762
the miners that came up from Mexico, did any of them 
return to Mexico? Well, not that I know of. Once

28:39.924 --> 28:41.826
they got here, they stayed here. They stayed here. 
Now, we had one here that he was Mr. Silver's number

28:42.847 --> 28:48.933
one man. He's a former now for a while. Then he got to 
send him off to Laredo after some hands to hire some

28:52.678 --> 28:59.585
coal diggers. And he got so much confidence in him, 
he let him write checks on the Texas Coal Company.

29:06.847 --> 29:10.770
So he went three or four times, and the last time he 
never did come back. Oh, no. He wrote a big check,

29:12.992 --> 29:19.017
got the money, and never did come back to Texas 
anymore. Just today, he had never been back.

29:24.862 --> 29:26.644
Yeah, Mr. Stevenson says, no, it was Dean. I said, 
yes, sir. You know what Joe did? I said, no, Mr.

29:29.046 --> 29:30.907
Stevenson, what? I knew what happened. I said, no, 
Mr. Stevenson, what happened, Mr. Stevenson? He

29:34.550 --> 29:36.432
says, that Russell give... I checked for $350, and 
he never showed up anymore. He didn't come back at

29:41.633 --> 29:44.375
all no more. I said, what are you going to do about it 
now? He said, what can we do? We don't know what

29:48.719 --> 29:51.101
we're about. You try to find out. I said, I will. I 
said, hide it there when I want to find out. I never

29:58.088 --> 29:59.509
was in Mexico. I don't know a thing about Mexico. I 
never been to Laredo. But what happened to all the

30:06.702 --> 30:11.427
mining families once the mines shut down in the 
30s? Oh, they scattered all over the country. Some

30:14.590 --> 30:20.977
ran down in Dallas, some in Fort Worth, some in 
Houston. Oh, they went all around. Some in San

30:23.500 --> 30:24.441
Antonio. They just scattered all over the 
country. What kind of work were they doing? I don't

30:28.225 --> 30:28.786
know. I don't know. They just left when the mines 
shut down. Yeah, they shut down. Some of them went

30:33.350 --> 30:35.713
to Malakoff. To where? Malakoff. Malakoff? 
Malakoff, Texas. I see. That's kind of east, I

30:41.482 --> 30:45.886
think, from here somewhere. And that mine closed 
up. And they all left there. I had a brother that

30:51.792 --> 30:55.556
worked there a long, long time at Malakoff. And 
when they closed down, he went to work for their

30:56.698 --> 31:02.764
house. What that old company name? Big, big 
outfit. Shell? No. No? No. Exxon? Texas. Texas,

31:11.564 --> 31:12.805
brother. Texas, yeah. I see. He went to work for 
Texaco. And he still, no, he retired now. He

31:18.972 --> 31:20.153
retired this year. He worked 32 years with the 
Texaco at Fort Arthur. I see. And he quit this year.

31:29.423 --> 31:30.224
He retired. Is this a friend of yours? My brother. 
Your brother? My brother, Jesse. It's just me and

31:33.997 --> 31:36.163
him, just two brothers left. He's the youngest 
one. I'm the oldest one. Yeah, me and Jesse's

31:42.259 --> 31:43.943
always left. And they just, he's what? He's a 
monocle?
