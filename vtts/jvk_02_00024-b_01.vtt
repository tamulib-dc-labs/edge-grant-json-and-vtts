WEBVTT

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:17.184
for something that he really had a feeling about.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:24.312
You remember at the time, the agencies and services were all kind of up for grabs.

00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:27.515
Who did they report to?

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:32.400
Did they report to the president, or through the president,

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:42.752
And Dr. Williams had no doubt with those agencies and services reporting to Dr. Miller.

00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:45.575
Truth is, he didn't know.

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:53.963
All the time that we had been in the other plans, they basically had reported to the client three times.

00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:57.887
And so that was kind of the end-all and end-all place for the agency.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.011
If they made it, they'd cry every day.

00:01:02.752 --> 00:01:03.653
They cried a lot of times.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:30.969
ultimate administrator, and he had no problem with them supporting the Jarvis.

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:37.318
And you'll remember Jarvis then created a vice president, where I just saw a friend of mine who was here, and he was president, Calhoun,

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:52.688
He had turned down a job, I believe.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:56.474
That's Mr. Wells' urgent.

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:58.537
Tell him, please stay.

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.405
We need you here now.

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:05.348
Please don't leave us now.

00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:29.897
And I'll see to it that, well, he was out there reading the recommendations from the president.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:30.918
And by that time, Dr. Miller had some recognition.

00:02:30.938 --> 00:02:31.839
So Calhoun was deeply hurt and felt betrayed.

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:32.280
And he was out of it.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.141
And they allowed Dr. Williams to negotiate

00:02:33.644 --> 00:02:42.937
That opened up really my job again.

00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:52.330
Because they gave, after Calhoun stood abandoned, he was dressed up pretty good.

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:56.756
They gave Dr. Williams a license to put his organization in place like he was.

00:02:56.776 --> 00:03:01.322
And while they had first asked him to wait on the night,

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:23.528
And you'll remember, he had Wayne Stevenson and Bob Walker all going up there with him.

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:27.635
The chancellor's office said, please, ask them.

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:29.217
And they had a kind of summit for the doing with Walker and the three of them.

00:03:30.462 --> 00:03:37.908
Let me add a little history at this point.

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:47.516
I picked up about 10 days in advance of the board meeting where the new president was going to be selected.

00:03:48.897 --> 00:04:00.267
I picked up a rumor that Dr. Miller's staff was working on a plan that the board would get a lot of phone calls, letters, telegrams, et cetera,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.124
in support of him, planned campaign.

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:13.816
I picked it up very, very, very indirectly, and I called a friend in Houston that I knew John Lindsay well.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:19.402
And I knew that John Lindsay knew Dr. Williams well.

00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:20.764
And I said, check this out.

00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:24.128
Don't use my name, and I will never use your name.

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:37.741
So he called Lindsey and told Lindsey that he had gotten it from somebody that he couldn't identify, and for Lindsey to mention it to Williams, and Williams said, well, whomever your source is, you can tell them they don't know what they're talking about.

00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:39.563
I'm the one to make the recommendation.

00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:41.846
Jarvis Miller's name has not come up.

00:04:41.986 --> 00:04:45.430
There have been no phone calls, no letters, no telegrams.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.976
About a week later, I got a second call from this same friend saying that,

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:58.623
Williams had called Lindsay a second time and said, I'm being inundated, that they are coming in in large numbers.

00:04:58.643 --> 00:05:01.590
I rode with Dr. Calhoun to that board meeting.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.437
where they did not accept Dr. Williams' recommendation.

00:05:07.138 --> 00:05:15.067
And I've never seen a man more calm in what must have been a very difficult day for him.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.109
He was calm and rational.

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:24.337
And as I recall, he moved out of the vice president's office over the weekend.

00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:25.418
It was empty.

00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:33.018
And Dr. Miller moved in that office over in the Teague building.

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.520
Oh, Teague building.

00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:35.822
In the Teague building.

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:45.096
And Dr. Miller was there on Monday and chatted with me and so forth.

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:54.730
I have been in Atlanta all week at a National Association of College and University Attorneys National Conference.

00:05:55.351 --> 00:06:22.249
When I got home, I called my father-in-law and he said, well, guess what I'm with?

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:23.991
He gave me the information that there was an effort being called into Washington, D.C.

00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:48.805
And I so well remember saying, well, you know, I've done a lot of work for Dr. Miller.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.688
And when I think about, you know, who he is, what he's a form of freedom, and things like that, I can certainly see why he would be considered.

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:52.429
And I don't have a say in the world.

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:53.630
I'm surprised.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.910
I told you.

00:06:57.856 --> 00:07:02.663
So I don't know why I guess he wouldn't see any line with him.

00:07:03.263 --> 00:07:13.337
I will say to you that out of all the cases that I've had, he's the hard hitter.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:17.002
I can understand that, having worked for him for four years.

00:07:17.143 --> 00:07:18.885
In fact, it was fair enough.

00:07:19.456 --> 00:07:45.025
Mm-hmm.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:08:04.795
But he can be tough.

00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:07.300
He can be vindictive.

00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:34.030
if you feel comfortable in commenting on this please do if not we'll go ahead i left to drive to el paso tuesday at noon

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:40.580
And Dr. Miller learned Wednesday night that he was being terminated as president.

00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:47.307
And I got calls from reporters early Thursday morning out there.

00:08:47.888 --> 00:08:52.833
I was unaware that that decision was forthcoming.

00:08:52.853 --> 00:08:54.975
Were you aware it was coming?

00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:58.039
Yeah, I knew that there was going to be a showdown.

00:08:58.059 --> 00:08:58.199
Okay.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:03.044
But Jarvis was moving the issue.

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:03.344
Yes.

00:09:05.547 --> 00:09:05.907
Yes.

00:09:06.072 --> 00:09:10.657
By that time, Frank Huber had come on the scene.

00:09:11.078 --> 00:09:11.578
Yes.

00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:20.248
And Frank, in Jarvis' own words, made Jack Williams look like a Sunday afternoon picker.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:20.408
Mm-hmm.

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:20.989
Quote, unquote.

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:21.149
Mm-hmm.

00:09:21.169 --> 00:09:24.693
And he would call Huber the eye of power.

00:09:24.713 --> 00:09:24.853
Mm-hmm.

00:09:24.873 --> 00:09:25.694
Yes, yes.

00:09:26.095 --> 00:09:26.836
I remember that.

00:09:26.856 --> 00:09:35.666
Well, I met with Jarvis the night before the meeting in his office, like at 6 o'clock in the evening.

00:09:35.686 --> 00:09:35.826
Mm-hmm.

00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:55.899
And I was, like you say, I was in the business of rewriting, rewriting, rewriting, rewriting.

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:56.519
Here we had Hubert come along.

00:09:56.539 --> 00:09:58.321
While Williams had been generally accommodating some of that.

00:09:59.302 --> 00:10:05.087
I'm here to tell you, Hubert took the job with the determination to create a system.

00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:14.474
and to make it stick and to be the head of it and to take on all of them.

00:10:16.237 --> 00:10:19.382
Do you think some board members also encouraged him to do that?

00:10:19.402 --> 00:10:30.198
I'm inclined to think they must have surely given him a huge life to do that because we instantly started rewriting those objectives.

00:10:30.218 --> 00:10:31.800
I'm telling you, everywhere there was anything,

00:10:32.236 --> 00:10:50.869
So, it took on a considerably different tone.

00:10:51.473 --> 00:11:05.447
But having a pretty good person dictating what the report will be and, you know, how it's going to be administrated by the state.

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:08.190
Right, about the middle of the spring, one afternoon.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.232
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:14.276
And that is that I didn't meet with those on that night before the board meeting.

00:11:14.296 --> 00:11:18.240
And the whole issue was who those agencies were going to put in.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:30.796
And Jarvis, it was a passion for him, and he felt it to the core of his very being that it was just totally wrong for them not to support him there.

00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:31.538
And I beg you, buddy.

00:11:32.412 --> 00:11:52.605
Do not make this a matter of life and death.

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:53.286
The doctor is not there for long.

00:11:53.306 --> 00:11:53.766
But you're a young man.

00:11:53.786 --> 00:11:54.347
He's not a young man at all.

00:11:54.367 --> 00:11:54.708
He's a tired one.

00:11:54.728 --> 00:11:55.429
He's not going to be there for you.

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:57.272
So buy a little bit of time and don't throw yourself on the railroad track over this thing.

00:11:57.292 --> 00:11:57.813
They've got them in slams.

00:11:57.833 --> 00:11:58.454
They've got them on the ground.

00:11:58.474 --> 00:11:59.095
They've got them on the ground.

00:11:59.513 --> 00:12:18.130
The reason I'm grinning is how similar what you said was to what some of us said to Dr. Miller the middle of that spring, I'll say March.

00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:37.272
One afternoon, without any previous planning on our part, Vice Presidents Prescott, Koldus, Vestal, and myself as dean of faculties, we said to Dr. Miller, look, Hubert's going to retire in a couple of years.

00:12:37.352 --> 00:12:38.433
You're a younger man.

00:12:38.493 --> 00:12:40.956
If you do it well, you'll be up there and be in charge.

00:12:41.357 --> 00:12:43.459
You can rewrite it however you want to.

00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:46.435
And he agreed, yeah, yeah, I ought to.

00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:50.060
But, you know, I'm so interested in this.

00:12:51.522 --> 00:12:55.948
But he promised us that he would hold off.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:57.571
But he didn't.

00:12:58.172 --> 00:12:58.552
Let's see.

00:12:58.572 --> 00:13:03.399
Now, I'm assuming in terms of the responsibilities that you need to get to this meeting soon.

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:04.901
Do we need to terminate this now?

00:13:05.822 --> 00:13:07.725
At some point in the next ten minutes.

00:13:07.807 --> 00:13:08.889
OK.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:28.618
Looking back over all of those years, about what percentage of the Chief Legal Counsel's responsibilities dealt with Texas A&M University as an academic institution compared to all the other campuses and the agencies?

00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:36.109
I would say close to 90%, certainly 80%.

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:55.729
There was a lot of research and a lot of issues that go around about what the Aggies determined.

00:13:55.749 --> 00:14:01.234
It was a well-known organization, but in the end, it took Clare's care about it for a minute.

00:14:01.254 --> 00:14:01.615
He probably won't.

00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:03.276
Clare, he took its share, too.

00:14:03.296 --> 00:14:04.037
It just was an area that legal issues

00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:13.573
And of the other campuses, it by far was the most frequent.

00:14:14.414 --> 00:14:28.226
Then, by and large, you, as the chief legal counsel for the system, you relied upon in-house staff.

00:14:29.167 --> 00:14:34.632
Did you ever call on external legal counsel?

00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:40.398
And this tells you how I would do that.

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:57.615
And right now I'm trying to put them together.

00:14:57.635 --> 00:15:02.200
I guess me too.

00:15:03.742 --> 00:15:04.062
But

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:34.723
I had not seen the best and only then because it was appearing in the right up, maybe after the first run indicated that the were in the play as being the

00:15:35.176 --> 00:15:55.794
And so that appeared one day in the pipeline.

00:15:55.814 --> 00:15:56.875
And he was so proud of that.

00:15:56.895 --> 00:16:01.259
He was saying that he wanted me to get a plane.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:02.740
And he had a plane.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.681
And he was using our...

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:31.249
Well, I quickly learned that the play had been used in that in New York for months on end, or maybe years.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.512
And so, Arno says to me, he says,

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:46.482
Let me run my press with some people whose legal opinion, the collection of all these people.

00:16:46.502 --> 00:16:57.813
So he called Judge Coleson and some other people around Houston to get there to finish judging him and what he and him ought to do.

00:16:57.833 --> 00:16:58.874
And I said, well, it was a very unified voice.

00:16:58.894 --> 00:16:59.335
Say the hell out loud.

00:16:59.355 --> 00:17:00.296
And, you know, I had to do so.

00:17:00.316 --> 00:17:02.338
But there were often times when I was,

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:12.215
call from the external legal community.

00:17:13.297 --> 00:17:20.532
Usually people with whom I have developed a relationship, and they're always wonderful and willing to help.

00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:24.259
We were bound by the Attorney General to use the Attorney General with respect to our state litigation.

00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:48.862
But from time to time, I'd be granted permission to use it.

00:17:48.882 --> 00:17:50.484
We would get out that council sometimes pro bono and sometimes for poison.

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:51.144
We would all get wonderful help.

00:17:51.164 --> 00:17:51.825
Some of it would be on the shelf.

00:17:51.845 --> 00:17:53.166
Other things I could tell, you know, where Aggie lawyers would go.
