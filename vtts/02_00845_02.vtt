00:01.786 --> 00:16.084
And

00:01.786 --> 00:16.084
would you say that they carried over any customs 
that changed this community, or were they more or

00:01.786 --> 00:16.084
less Americanized by the time that you came in? I 
think they've been Americanized to a certain

00:16.104 --> 00:30.021
extent, but there have been some Italian farmers 
in the Brazos Bottom that were, I heard at one time

00:16.104 --> 00:30.021
that they worked so hard that they were able to buy 
up land. They made good in the farming part, and

00:33.778 --> 00:48.063
they were able to buy up a lot of land that some of the 
Native Americans weren't ambitious enough to

00:33.778 --> 00:48.063
work to get. I don't know about the other ethnic 
groups. You may mention that the blacks, were they

00:55.313 --> 01:07.168
more or less in a certain part of the city or the 
area, the region around here? Yes. They were

01:08.770 --> 01:11.393
about... They still live in the sections

01:11.413 --> 01:19.804
that they were in. There are a few that have moved 
out. Would you say that they are still as...

01:24.608 --> 01:27.813
They're very good citizens, I think. I know one 
black woman who is a very ambitious person for her

01:27.833 --> 01:38.668
family. She has a daughter who's married to a 
colonel in the army, and this daughter has a

01:39.269 --> 01:48.462
nursing degree.

01:49.344 --> 01:53.029
She has two sons who are principals of schools in 
various places. And to this day, when her name is

01:54.072 --> 02:06.981
mentioned here, everybody knows about her and 
knows what a really ambitious woman she is. And

02:07.583 --> 02:10.429
she's very highly respected. Would you say that 
there have... there has been a separation, of

02:13.664 --> 02:21.835
course, between the whites and the blacks in most 
things. Would you say that that is still prevalent

02:21.855 --> 02:28.645
or are they coming together closer or were they 
ever separated?

02:34.513 --> 02:40.802
I don't know that there's been too much change in 
their lifestyles.

02:43.111 --> 02:46.799
Some of them have much better jobs than we used to 
have. But I really don't have contact with them

02:47.841 --> 02:50.788
now. I just don't know. I don't have any help at all. 
And I have no contact with the black people

02:53.494 --> 02:57.643
anymore.

03:01.167 --> 03:09.598
You mentioned, I noticed when you were talking 
about the feeds and how the prices went down when

03:01.167 --> 03:09.598
the first supermarket was built here. Did it seem 
to be

03:11.019 --> 03:20.311
certain owners of stores before that time that 
kept the prices up? Yes. They were old time people

03:22.113 --> 03:27.360
in Bryan and they were It was hard on them to cut 
prices when the supermarkets

03:28.842 --> 03:41.298
came in and brought in

03:28.842 --> 03:41.298
lower prices.

03:45.003 --> 03:52.713
Well, how long have you lived in this area, the 
number of years since, what was the year that you

03:45.003 --> 03:52.713
first moved here? I came to Brown in 1927. And you 
say that you had two sons, and they both got their

03:57.985 --> 04:02.611
college degrees. Well, the older boy got his 
bachelor's degree from the University of Texas.

04:10.182 --> 04:18.293
And then he went on to

04:10.182 --> 04:18.293
medical school in Dallas. The other son went to 
Galveston for his medical training. And both took

04:24.222 --> 04:26.625
their specialty. at the same school. So your two 
sons, they both left the area at first to gain

04:30.248 --> 04:38.537
employment? Or has the youngest one just finished 
school? Oh, no. He's practiced in Houston for

04:41.060 --> 04:43.703
three years. He was in the Army for two years after 
his residence in psychiatry. And then he

04:51.671 --> 04:55.515
practiced medicine in Houston for three years. 
has just decided to move to this community because

04:55.883 --> 05:00.650
he thinks it's a good community. That's what I was 
wondering, whether, you know, all your kids, both

05:01.111 --> 05:11.266
of your sons had left, or whether, you know, they 
were here, and so now your youngest son has come

05:01.111 --> 05:11.266
back. He's just been back two weeks, but he's very 
happy with me. He plans to stay here, though. Yes,

05:17.235 --> 05:18.417
he plans to stay here. In fact, he's going to live in 
this house. He wants to come home. I'm selling in

05:23.457 --> 05:30.766
the house, and they're going to add to it and 
rebuild it, and I'm going to an apartment. And

05:30.786 --> 05:32.749
you're staying here then? In College Station, of 
course, this is home. I wouldn't consider

05:34.772 --> 05:38.396
anything else. Well, thank you for the time and the 
interview. Well, you're quite welcome. I hope

05:44.685 --> 05:47.748
I've been at least a little helpful to you. It's 
been real good. Thank you again. You're welcome.

05:56.482 --> 06:00.588
This interview has been with Mrs. William Potts, 
first name Aris. She lives at 306 Lee Street in

06:01.489 --> 06:08.639
College Station, Texas, and has lived there for 
quite a number of years. She came to this community

06:10.442 --> 06:19.975
in 1927 to teach high school at Bryan High School, 
and it was here that she met her husband. She stated

06:19.955 --> 06:27.327
that certain conveniences were already here when 
she arrived, but there was also quite a few

06:19.955 --> 06:27.327
lacking. I found, by reading old issues of the 
Bryan Eagle, that, in fact, the first sewer

06:28.109 --> 06:42.773
treatment plant was installed in 1913, run by the 
city of Bryan, and so it had been in operation for

06:28.109 --> 06:42.773
several years before she arrived. She stated that 
when she came here, sewer service was installed.

06:47.363 --> 06:50.249
She also mentioned that the roads were just 
gravel. It was not until November 28, 1929, that

06:51.752 --> 07:00.610
the people voted to issue bonds for the purpose of 
building a system of highways. Before this, even

07:00.590 --> 07:09.202
Highway 6 was not in very good condition and was 
prone to frequent flooding, such as on November

07:00.590 --> 07:09.202
11, 1929. Also in the year 1929, stores such as 
Montgomery Ward announced openings in Bryan,

07:09.763 --> 07:28.268
which indicate that the Bryan College Station 
area had a bright outlook as far as growth,

07:09.763 --> 07:28.268
especially when you take into account that this 
was during Depression years. The schools were in

07:28.248 --> 07:33.055
poor condition except for the one in Bryan where 
Mrs. Potts taught. She seemed to be highly pleased

07:34.217 --> 07:36.560
with the school. H. L. Durham was the 
superintendent of the Bryan system at that time.

07:42.609 --> 07:49.800
Even as late as 1930, Bryan High School was the only 
school in the area that had a good scholastic

07:42.609 --> 07:49.800
program. She mentioned that her uncle had come to 
Bryan to open up Allen Academy. This took place in

07:54.485 --> 07:59.589
1899, and so he was quite established by the time 
she arrived. This tends to make me believe, along

08:00.510 --> 08:15.805
with a few other remarks such as, I don't have any 
help at all, inferring that she used to have

08:00.510 --> 08:15.805
domestic help, that she and her husband were above 
average as far as their social and economic

08:00.510 --> 08:15.805
levels. Finally, in 1939, the city of College 
Station started taking on other

08:15.785 --> 08:26.708
responsibilities besides just the college, such 
as power lines, sewage, and water lines. They

08:27.470 --> 08:30.857
incorporated and began to grow as a city. Mrs. 
Potts has seen vast changes take place during her

08:30.837 --> 08:34.763
years. She has gone through such presidents as 
Hoover, FDR, and Truman. She has seen a small

08:39.910 --> 08:46.019
cluster of professors and other 
college-connected people form the city of

08:39.910 --> 08:46.019
College Station. She lived for a time in an era 
where there was no television and people made

08:46.640 --> 08:54.752
their own entertainment, of which she played no 
small part. She has seen people grow apart with the

08:54.732 --> 09:04.129
invention of the television and there seemed to be 
a twinge of sadness in her voice as she told me how

08:54.732 --> 09:04.129
social life had changed. She has seen College 
Station and Bryan grow into one big city and Texas

09:04.930 --> 09:12.244
A&M grow into a major institution. She has much 
knowledge and this interview just barely touches

09:13.005 --> 09:16.892
her resources.
