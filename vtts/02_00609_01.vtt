00:08.519 --> 00:17.818
The following is an interview by Elmer Sparks with 
Celia Black, former slave of Tyler Texas. This

00:17.838 --> 00:29.802
being October the 11th, 1974, many years have 
passed since Mrs. Black first arrived in this

00:17.838 --> 00:29.802
world on September the 10th, 1859.

00:33.528 --> 00:55.307
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your early 
life, and the time you were born, and your

00:33.528 --> 00:55.307
schooling, and you go ahead and tell what you 
might, and we might ask

00:33.528 --> 00:55.307
you a few more questions. I had my birthday, my 
birthday, I had a nice time. I had a nice time. I

00:58.520 --> 01:02.806
enjoyed

00:58.520 --> 01:02.806
it. I enjoyed it. The nice white people was there, 
and the president was there, and his wife, and

01:04.970 --> 01:17.068
shook hands with me, and just, I don't know. I just 
enjoyed it. I did. I enjoyed it with so many people

01:22.155 --> 01:26.181
there. And I didn't

01:26.785 --> 01:44.901
think that

01:26.785 --> 01:44.901
I had the name to be recognized enough to go on 
there. I didn't think I'd be recognized enough to

01:44.921 --> 01:51.607
go on there. But I've always had that feeling of 
wanting to be myself. and the way his white and

01:55.490 --> 02:02.120
colors both of them care for me. Whenever my 
colors,

02:02.140 --> 02:20.687
white and colors for me to do anything and have 
anything to do with them, I'd always let it, let it

02:02.140 --> 02:20.687
clean, kept myself clean, and I always tried to 
teach They're

02:20.667 --> 02:28.657
nice, and I was good to them. I was good to the 
children. And I just couldn't be no better son than

02:29.819 --> 02:33.263
I was. And I didn't care when they called for me

02:33.283 --> 02:41.834
to do anything. I was right there ready to do it, 
because I'm going to try to do what I could if I know.

02:46.139 --> 02:47.721
So that's the way I carried myself. And

02:47.701 --> 03:06.468
I'm so proud to know

02:47.701 --> 03:06.468
that I've been mechanized enough to care for me. 
Oh, and in Texas, and in the United States. I'm so

03:07.870 --> 03:11.435
proud to know that I'm cared for in the United 
States. Oh! Oh, there's no fool not coming with me

03:11.495 --> 03:23.031
down and can't help myself. If I felt like I 
couldn't help, I'd always be ready. I'd be ready.

03:31.802 --> 03:35.207
I'd be ready to help. Oh, God, it's true. I feel like 
I could. I'd be ready to help. So... I'm down there

03:38.832 --> 03:50.544
in the king, but I've

03:38.832 --> 03:50.544
got a good desire. I've got a good mind. Oh, to be 
content, to contend on trying to do what I can by the

03:51.305 --> 03:57.511
help of the Lord. If I can't do, if I can't do, I can 
speak well. I can speak well. Oh, it's hard to help.

04:08.093 --> 04:16.144
Oh, as I can speak with a child of health. Oh, and my 
speech. And I trust my Heavenly Father that I can be

04:20.269 --> 04:33.207
honored enough to keep my, oh, to keep my 
admiration up as long as the good Lord has led me,

04:20.269 --> 04:33.207
spread me. You know, she's family. Well, you're 
speaking of your celebration. Do you remember

04:40.834 --> 04:47.001
anything about your folks are talking about the 
back when you were born and that age? Fifty-one.

04:50.405 --> 04:54.851
And back at your mother's town about from the time 
you were born and where you were born, Dad? Barn.

04:57.994 --> 04:58.435
Yes. I don't understand.

05:03.208 --> 05:08.837
Celia, tell him about when you were a little baby 
and a little girl. Oh, when I was a baby, I couldn't

05:08.857 --> 05:11.721
have known nothing. I couldn't have known nothing 
when I was a baby. No, sir. You remember your mother

05:17.128 --> 05:19.412
talking about it, don't you? Yes,

05:19.432 --> 05:22.857
sir. Mom? Mom. Do

05:23.558 --> 05:32.228
you

05:23.558 --> 05:32.228
remember when you were a baby girl and you used to 
ride oxen and things? Yeah. Well, my grandfather

05:32.869 --> 05:38.455
had some big old oxen. He had one with a big white 
horn. Oh, it looked like a house.

05:48.263 --> 05:54.475
Well, I hung there, and I used to sit up there and 
tune them horns. And then his name was Coley. His

05:58.363 --> 06:02.592
name was Coley, and the other one was named Lett. 
Oh, and Grandpa didn't just drive him seriously.

06:08.615 --> 06:24.970
where he

06:08.615 --> 06:24.970
put up children in the old ox wagon and cast them 
just as big as he was in a cage. And

06:25.372 --> 06:37.252
I'd get up there in old Coley's,

06:25.372 --> 06:37.252
paint in old Coley's home and sit up there. Sit up 
there and

06:37.933 --> 06:44.925
just be sitting in the house. But the funny story, 
my grandfather went to town. No one wants to get so

06:50.802 --> 06:57.478
nervous and have to go cross the river.

07:00.164 --> 07:04.474
It's in the summertime in June, and The old oxen got

07:04.808 --> 07:12.841
hot. They got hot. When they know this thing, 
Grandpa know this thing, the old oxen run off and

07:13.843 --> 07:25.722
run off into the river. River said, we're dead. 
We're dead. We're away. And I stayed up there. And

07:32.854 --> 07:40.308
O'Cord, O'Cord his own home, picked up in O'Cord 
his home. And he's waved through the water. And the

07:44.296 --> 07:50.485
second I came down, I stayed in there, too. I headed 
to his home. I headed to his home, but I didn't pull

07:53.409 --> 07:57.274
off in the river. I'm telling you, I headed, too. 
Yes, I did. Oh! Oh, my grandpa was just hoping I'd

08:01.981 --> 08:15.481
get my dad to live. And he was, and the old corner of 
the electric

08:15.762 --> 08:25.456
was coming through. They come out too, yes, they 
did. Celia, tell him about when you were born in

08:26.157 --> 08:29.061
Miss Clay's bed. I did. I was born behind this white 
woman. I said, well, she was no poor woman. No, she

08:36.250 --> 08:38.774
wasn't. Her husband was living there. Oh, she was 
no poor woman. She brought my mother here from

08:46.904 --> 08:54.313
South Oakland up in this country. She brought my 
mother here in Texas when she was young. When my

09:01.491 --> 09:03.613
mother was young, she wasn't grown.

09:06.216 --> 09:09.960
She brought her here. She didn't get grown. With 
her children.

09:20.190 --> 09:22.613
Well, my father, with my high-handsome, 
so-called man's name, Mr. Lawson. Mr. Robinson

09:31.520 --> 09:54.423
was a white man, and Papa was a boy, and he did, Mr. 
Clay both got hired to be the yard boy for Mama. She

09:54.443 --> 09:58.287
was like, Mr. Clay, you know, After

09:58.267 --> 10:20.055
that, after that, after you tell the world, I was, 
they said, so my Papa and Mama got together. So now I

10:20.075 --> 10:21.056
don't know how they got together. But anyhow, my 
Papa and Mama, But Mrs. Cray had my father there.

10:29.546 --> 10:36.332
Yeah, boy, he stayed there till he was a grown young 
man, too, with Mrs. Cray. Right

10:36.352 --> 10:48.062
in her yard, far out.

10:48.082 --> 10:48.563
Her yard and her horses. You were born in Mrs. 
Cray's bed? Uh-huh. So you were born with Mrs.

10:50.445 --> 10:52.406
Cray? I was born right behind Mrs. Cray. On a 
Tuesday morning, my mother said, my mother said to

10:53.127 --> 11:07.509
me on a Tuesday morning, my eyes were on right 
behind Ms. Clay in her bed. My mother always slept

11:08.991 --> 11:15.782
with Ms. Clay when she was young, when she was 14 and 
19. And Ms. Clay, after she married, My papa, Miss

11:19.688 --> 11:29.549
Kelly wouldn't agree for my papa to take her away 
from there, no. She wouldn't. She wouldn't agree

11:30.251 --> 11:33.678
for us to try and take her away from there.

11:36.465 --> 11:36.605
Oh! Oh! In them days, them days, the white people 
had control over them. When they had a color of

11:46.903 --> 11:55.517
help, it wouldn't be good for you to take them away 
from them. And my mother would discuss it. She

12:04.827 --> 12:09.091
wouldn't let nobody take her away from there. She 
laid her there with her children. With her

12:12.274 --> 12:12.955
children. She laid them there with her boys and 
girls. She didn't have but one girl. Oh, but she had

12:20.463 --> 12:23.766
five or six boys. She had five boys. Miss Craig did. 
Mama loved this one. And

12:34.132 --> 12:42.503
Miss Craig good. She didn't have one good. And she 
was a big one. She wasn't big. She wasn't a big girl.

12:49.532 --> 12:53.837
Oh,

12:49.532 --> 12:53.837
but she stayed out. Until she got to be a young 
missus.

13:00.128 --> 13:04.816
Oh, with mama and her brother. She'd grown up to be 
in there by the dorm. Before she, oh, I ever think

13:09.202 --> 13:15.212
about trying to get it out amongst the boys.

13:17.876 --> 13:18.817
Oh, man. You remember Abraham Mason? Better than 
him? Who? I hear my mother talk about him and my

13:24.178 --> 13:31.840
father, but I never did know him. I didn't even know 
him myself, but I heard them talking about him all

13:32.056 --> 13:38.244
the time. What did they say about President 
Lincoln? Oh, well, they gave him a good name. They

13:45.533 --> 13:47.375
gave him a good name. Oh, oh, and President Hall. 
Oh, oh, they... They gave him a pretty good name.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.340
They gave him a pretty good name. There's another 
one I know, but I forgot it. Forgot his name.

14:11.232 --> 14:12.334
Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln. That's it. Oh, 
Abraham Lincoln, they thought Abraham was a

14:16.083 --> 14:23.854
beast. They thought, everybody thought Abraham 
was the best citizen in the world. They thought he

14:31.205 --> 14:34.530
was the dead best. Did you do any picking geese or 
preventive edge and things like that in those

14:34.966 --> 14:45.241
days? Did I have any? I wasn't nothing but a kid. I 
didn't have a sense of things like I got now. I

14:55.315 --> 14:57.278
didn't have a sense of things. I didn't know

14:57.258 --> 15:06.182
nothing about them. Nothing.

15:12.378 --> 15:21.458
I can tell them it's crazy to be a young business. 
The only time I know anything about the company.

15:26.929 --> 15:31.399
And then my papa had this, oh man. Did you ever pick 
cotton

15:31.379 --> 15:45.507
out in

15:31.379 --> 15:45.507
the fields? They can't. Oh, good graces of life. 
They can't. I've raised them, see, and I've fed

15:52.728 --> 15:55.693
them. Miss Craig, they have got mama. I've raised 
them, see, and I've fed them. Got away from Miss

16:04.668 --> 16:06.752
Craig. Oh, my God. I didn't do nothing, but where 
can I see you? Where can I see you? Oh, goodness. Oh,

16:17.967 --> 16:20.129
my goodness. Every year, I go out and go on the 
group. I've got to be mad. I'm going to wait for

16:27.579 --> 16:28.761
myself. We go, my name, my name. I go out west and 
pick cotton. Pick cotton. Well that was hard work.

16:41.740 --> 16:45.307
Didn't you have some entertainment? Do any 
dancing or anything? Uh huh. Did you dance? Did you

16:52.100 --> 16:54.063
dance? Dance. Oh, I used to dance. But I don't do it 
now. No, I don't dance now. I try my best to serve my

17:04.182 --> 17:07.165
master. I'm trying my best to serve my head.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.515
Help me, Father. Silence. I'm trying my best to 
serve God. I don't study about no man. Don't dance

17:23.683 --> 17:25.985
now. You don't know, Mama. You danced in your young 
days. Oh, in my young days? Yeah. Oh, I went to balls

17:31.930 --> 17:34.613
when I was young. Oh, when I was young, I went to 
dancing. I didn't tell, I ain't gonna tell no one

17:40.180 --> 17:46.948
what I thought I went to dancing when I was young.

17:50.552 --> 17:52.695
See, see, ma'am? Ma'am? Do you remember... Going 
to town when you were young, were there any big

17:53.551 --> 17:58.718
buildings back then? Oh, big building, Mama. When 
you went to town when you were young, were the

18:01.221 --> 18:04.806
streets dirt?

18:07.729 --> 18:11.334
Did you go to town in a wagon when you were a young 
girl? I don't know. Mama, you know what you used to

18:13.517 --> 18:15.159
tell us? You used to go to town in the wagon. Oh, oh, I 
did. Oh, we used to go in a horse wagon. I thought you

18:24.542 --> 18:27.606
were talking about something else. Oh, yeah, we 
used to go in a wagon. Celia, did you ever see a

18:31.511 --> 18:34.555
stagecoach? Ever see what? A stagecoach. A 
stagecoach, where the people rode in the

18:38.640 --> 18:46.109
stagecoach and the horses pulled them. Did you 
ever see one? Yes, I did. You call them and it's such

18:47.821 --> 18:56.508
a funny name that I don't know what you're talking 
about. What did you call them? I called them

18:57.910 --> 19:01.873
Hossie. Hossie. Neal and Hossie. Neal and Hossie. 
That's what my grandfather called them. Neal and

19:10.981 --> 19:12.082
Hossie. What did Mr. and Ms. Clay ride in when they 
would go somewhere? in a cage, what you call it, a

19:17.690 --> 19:24.981
cage.

19:26.543 --> 19:30.729
She called it a cage. It was a crane down there. A big 
old thing that looked like a... Oh, you look like a

19:38.699 --> 19:43.646
cop. Look like a cop. Did you hear anything about 
the Indians at that day when you were young and the

19:45.749 --> 19:53.100
things that they did? The Indians? No, no, no, no. 
You're talking about the Indian people. Oh. I had

19:58.628 --> 20:02.393
seen them, but I didn't know them. I had seen them, 
but I didn't know nothing about them. I never did

20:06.799 --> 20:13.749
get in and come to North Country with them. I never 
did.

20:17.634 --> 20:22.341
The Indians were pretty well gone at that time down 
here, I think, but not to the North. Anything else

20:22.861 --> 20:26.589
you're thinking of me about there? Well, we thank 
you anyway. And we sure hope you have more

20:31.019 --> 20:37.714
birthdays. And we're going to come up from the 
Panhandle, so we've been thinking of you. We've

20:44.382 --> 20:45.124
been thinking of you. God bless

20:45.364 --> 20:49.634
you. Goodbye. Goodbye. I hope to meet you here. If 
you don't leave, Andy... This was, hopefully, the

20:56.830 --> 21:04.451
end of the war. The end of a new war.
