00:07.118 --> 00:15.368
This is Martha Hunt interviewing Dr. Ruth 
Schaefer, November 16, 1985, on women in

00:07.118 --> 00:15.368
academia.

00:20.314 --> 00:25.440
Dr. Schaefer, how long have you been teaching at 
the university level?

00:28.203 --> 00:35.792
Let's see.

00:36.599 --> 00:38.161
Almost 35 years. 35 years. And how long has that 
been at A&M? 15. 15. Where did you go to school for

00:45.293 --> 00:49.359
your graduate and undergraduate degrees? I did my 
undergraduate degree at Hunter College in New

00:49.379 --> 01:02.860
York, and then I received a master's at Penn State 
and a doctorate at the University of North

00:49.379 --> 01:02.860
Carolina in Chapel Hill. And what made you decide 
to become a professor?

01:10.813 --> 01:19.662
Well, I'm

01:10.813 --> 01:19.662
not really sure that I ever did decide to become a 
professor. When I was a junior or lower senior, I

01:21.064 --> 01:34.298
was intrigued by a group of studies that we read in 
sociology. these were community studies and I

01:34.750 --> 01:53.948
thought it would be fun to make community studies 
and so I decided to go on in graduate school as a

01:34.750 --> 01:53.948
natural course of that interest and make 
community studies.

01:57.172 --> 02:02.817
Did you feel it was a choice that you had to make 
between having a family and having a career? No.

02:08.014 --> 02:12.058
Now, I did have one experience. I decided just 
before I graduated from college that I would apply

02:12.539 --> 02:28.956
to

02:12.539 --> 02:28.956
Gettysburg Seminary to become a Lutheran 
minister. And I was rejected. I don't even know

02:33.419 --> 02:40.111
whether there were any Lutheran women clergy at 
that time. But my other choice was to

02:41.394 --> 02:52.294
go into sociology and become a researcher.

02:52.578 --> 02:54.421
don't think that I even thought. I just assumed 
that someday I would meet someone and fall in love

02:54.441 --> 03:02.452
and marry and that everything would just fit in. I 
never

03:03.053 --> 03:11.905
even gave it a moment's thought that this was a 
choice between one or the other. When you applied

03:13.287 --> 03:17.874
to seminary, do you feel that you were rejected 
because you were a woman? Yes. Oh, yes. Yes,

03:21.839 --> 03:22.500
absolutely. And in fact, we were talking about 
this the other day because at the University of

03:23.307 --> 03:33.337
North Carolina was a woman who was the first 
president of the Southern. She was an officer in

03:34.078 --> 03:38.543
the American society. She wrote many books and was 
editor of Social Forces, which is one of our major

03:40.144 --> 03:47.712
journals. And she also was Lutheran. And when she 
finished her PhD at North Carolina, she applied to

03:51.205 --> 03:59.218
teach at a small Lutheran college, and they 
rejected her. And then something like 15 years

04:00.019 --> 04:05.929
later, they asked her if she would come and teach in 
a Lutheran college. By that time, she was one of the

04:05.989 --> 04:09.835
top women sociologists in the country. And I think 
they wanted to offer her something like $6,000 a

04:10.186 --> 04:13.490
year. Oh, my goodness. So she rejected it at that 
time. But in her case, too, it was the fact that

04:17.954 --> 04:23.480
women were just not accepted. But that didn't mean 
women were... A church-related school was very

04:23.861 --> 04:31.249
different from a state school. There were... I 
went to a women's college on the undergraduate

04:35.573 --> 04:38.877
level So I had a lot of role models probably. That's 
why it never dawned on me that one made a choice

04:41.495 --> 04:56.756
between a career and marriage because almost all 
my professors were married and had children and

04:41.495 --> 04:56.756
were pursuing their careers as well. What is your 
definition of a liberated woman or a feminist?

05:15.458 --> 05:23.689
I'm not sure that I've ever given a great deal of 
thought.

05:25.371 --> 05:42.394
And I'm not sure that

05:25.371 --> 05:42.394
some of the connotations of liberated and

05:25.371 --> 05:42.394
feminist, I'm not sure that they're the same. I 
think they have different meanings. I think they

05:45.047 --> 05:46.810
have different meanings. And I think you have to 
remember that I come from a little bit different

05:47.271 --> 05:56.003
tradition than some of the younger women faculty. 
And that basically, while I was discriminated

05:57.184 --> 06:11.925
against in terms of salary level, I never suffered 
some of the discrimination that some of the later,

05:57.184 --> 06:11.925
that some women colleagues have suggested that 
they suffered. So that I, my position has always

06:17.138 --> 06:31.537
been that a woman did deserve, if she was filling a 
similar position, the same salary levels and same

06:17.138 --> 06:31.537
opportunities as men. I look on this as equality 
rather than liberation or feminist or so on. And

06:39.665 --> 07:04.438
frankly, one of the problems that I have had early 
on at Texas A&M and one of the problems that I had in

06:39.665 --> 07:04.438
graduate school for a short time was the fact that 
people differentiate between male and female

06:39.665 --> 07:04.438
scientists. I see. Well, do you feel that... You 
have been, say, following your husband around

07:10.343 --> 07:16.114
because he was a sociologist. Okay, okay. I taught 
after I received my master's. I originally wanted

07:21.424 --> 07:25.471
to go straight on after finishing my master's for a 
doctor. And I worked under a man who, I guess one of

07:26.553 --> 07:32.925
the reasons that, I didn't recognize a lot of 
discrimination was I was always very lucky and

07:33.496 --> 07:40.062
worked under marvelous people. And at Penn State I 
worked under a man named William G. Mather, who at

07:40.803 --> 07:57.460
the tender age of late 80s was working very 
actively in retirement in Florida for women's

07:40.803 --> 07:57.460
rights and for the passage of ERA. While he never 
discussed any of these areas, except human rights

08:02.369 --> 08:06.013
in general. He didn't differentiate between 
women and so on. He was very active. He took me on. He

08:11.419 --> 08:18.247
sought me out and offered me the position of his 
research assistant. And he is a superb human

08:18.267 --> 08:25.556
being. And so I didn't have that kind of 
experience. And I think I've missed your question

08:29.821 --> 08:31.903
somewhere there. Oh, I was just talking about when 
you came to A&M, when you received a job at A&M, was

08:31.934 --> 08:40.226
your husband also? Oh, the following, okay. Okay, 
so I worked first and taught at the University of

08:42.549 --> 08:47.296
Rochester after the Masters. He said, this is not 
going to be a rural society, and don't go on in rural

08:47.396 --> 08:54.847
sociology. And so he literally forced me, found me 
a job teaching at the University of Rochester,

09:01.313 --> 09:08.160
when I went home over the Christmas holidays, I 
came back, I had this job, because he didn't really

09:01.313 --> 09:08.160
want me to go on. And he was right, you know, this is 
not a rural society. At that time, I was the only

09:11.243 --> 09:19.672
woman member of the, as a graduate student, I was 
the only female member of the rural sociological

09:11.243 --> 09:19.672
society. So he was very wise. Okay, so I taught at 
Rochester for about a year and a half before going

09:21.214 --> 09:30.223
on for my doctorate at North Carolina. And I was, I 
had made all my own decisions. Okay. I met my

09:39.480 --> 09:45.167
husband when I was just about finished the doctor. 
And he was behind me because he'd been in the

09:45.207 --> 09:51.836
service and went back to school after completing 
longing. So that when we married, I then literally

09:52.496 --> 09:57.763
did follow him. And I never ever had any problem 
getting a job. But he always had the job. It was

10:06.345 --> 10:11.971
never a matter of, it's your turn now, or that kind 
of thing. And I recognize that that is partly the

10:12.892 --> 10:15.454
case. But in some respects, because we have had 
some experience here in attempting to recruit

10:16.075 --> 10:26.986
women, I'm not sure that that truly works. I see. 
And the reason I'm not sure, if you're interested

10:28.979 --> 10:38.014
in why I'm not sure, is that on several occasions we 
have offered positions to women who are married.

10:38.034 --> 10:44.504
And we raised the question with them, what happens 
if we offer you a position and your husband does not

10:38.034 --> 10:44.504
get a position in the area? And their comment was, 
we will come regardless because it is our turn. But

10:50.454 --> 10:51.375
none of them when it came down to the nuts and bolts, 
ever did. They always went wherever both partners

10:56.424 --> 11:00.028
could get a job. Oh, well, that's very 
interesting. So I'm not sure that this works.

11:07.916 --> 11:18.848
Well,

11:07.916 --> 11:18.848
when you received a job offer here, or your husband 
did and you did, was there a discrimination as far

11:07.916 --> 11:18.848
as As far as salary, because he was a man? When we 
came, we were finishing up a book. We came in June

11:25.032 --> 11:29.718
instead of waiting until the end of the summer. And 
I wrote a letter to all the divisions of the

11:31.260 --> 11:38.930
university that I felt might be receptive to a 
sociologist. I had had experiences at Alabama

11:38.950 --> 11:48.582
where I could teach in the sociology department, 
but I could only teach one course because my

11:38.950 --> 11:48.582
husband was also teaching. And so a school of 
social work was developed, and the dean was just a

11:49.034 --> 11:58.282
truly outstanding person. And an old friend of 
mine had worked with him in Rochester and later in

11:59.323 --> 12:16.999
California, so when he was announced that he was to 
come as the dean of a new school of social work, I

11:59.323 --> 12:16.999
contacted him and asked him whether he was 
interested in employing me. So I taught research

12:17.333 --> 12:24.079
methods and sociological type things in the 
School of Social Work. So I was full time, my

12:24.099 --> 12:26.301
husband was full time. When I came here, I didn't 
think there would be a chance of a job in sociology.

12:33.848 --> 12:38.772
And so I wrote all these letters and different 
people interviewed me. One day I went in and was

12:39.373 --> 12:44.978
interviewed by a man named Earl Cook, who was to 
become dean of geosciences shortly after our

12:45.211 --> 12:49.235
interview. And he employed me part time with a 
research program that he had. So I had a

12:57.123 --> 13:00.867
considerable number of publications and several 
books. And so at that time, Texas A&M was trying to

13:01.627 --> 13:10.336
expand its horizon and to upgrade faculty. It was 
the beginning of that period. And so he employed me

13:13.359 --> 13:15.201
immediately. into this program. And then one week 
before the beginning of the fall semester, the

13:17.416 --> 13:25.088
young man who taught power and community left. I 
mean, just left. And so Dr. Scribonic called me and

13:28.273 --> 13:33.341
asked me whether I would come and teach those 
courses. And being Dr. Scribonic, he repeated

13:34.022 --> 13:44.378
again and again that he did not know whether this 
would work into a full-time position or, you know,

13:34.022 --> 13:44.378
a full-time appointment. And at that time, Texas 
had a rule that stated that a husband and wife

13:44.881 --> 13:59.198
could not work in the same department, one under 
the other. That's interesting. And in fact, I

14:02.382 --> 14:04.625
think that rule still stands. In other words, if 
one of us were to become head of a department, I

14:04.685 --> 14:13.656
don't think that the other one could work under 
him. Because I think Shirley Black and Bryson

14:14.851 --> 14:21.198
Gooch had that problem when they married. In 
history. Oh, that's interesting. Speaking of the

14:26.984 --> 14:35.274
publications that you have had, do you feel that 
you were ever turned down to have something

14:26.984 --> 14:35.274
published because you were a woman? No. No. No, I 
have never had that problem. Do you feel that you

14:44.500 --> 14:51.086
had to work harder to get where you are today than 
your husband had to? Do you feel that in school you

14:51.146 --> 14:57.132
had to work harder in getting a job because you're a 
woman?

15:04.118 --> 15:05.279
No. I never really had very much difficulty, and I 
guess I've always worked hard.

15:14.369 --> 15:26.285
Did

15:14.369 --> 15:26.285
you receive less encouragement for your 
achievements? Or were you always encouraged by

15:26.986 --> 15:31.953
your parents and your professors and other 
colleagues?

15:39.583 --> 15:40.945
That's a difficult question. I'm from a New 
England family. And

15:44.812 --> 16:07.208
my parents just always had the expectation that I 
would do well or that I would work hard because in

15:44.812 --> 16:07.208
the New England family you work hard in the 
Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism.

16:08.099 --> 16:11.883
My parents were always encouraging.

16:13.545 --> 16:18.771
My mother and father never believed that there 
wasn't anything. I mean, it never dawned on me that

16:19.332 --> 16:25.639
there would be a problem in a career because one was 
a woman.

16:28.542 --> 16:36.632
Do you ever feel that male colleagues would avoid 
you or feel that what you had to say was

16:28.542 --> 16:36.632
unimportant? No. I don't think so. I think that

16:40.247 --> 16:51.718
that's a complicated question because it doesn't 
take a few things into consideration. For

16:52.919 --> 17:05.311
example, when I meet a new colleague, male or 
female, let's say in another department, I don't

16:52.919 --> 17:05.311
accept them just because they're another 
colleague. I kind of look them over and I listen to

17:06.554 --> 17:08.437
them. And if I'm going to work with them, I 
determine what their qualifications are and I

17:09.418 --> 17:17.069
assess them. I think everyone has the right to 
assess someone that they're going to be working

17:17.670 --> 17:22.937
with, male or female. It doesn't really make any 
difference. And so I would expect people to assess

17:26.022 --> 17:36.156
me and to use the skills that I have. just as I use the 
skills that other people have. There are several

17:40.508 --> 17:53.526
people on campus that I use whenever I need advice 
or whenever some area comes up that I need special

17:40.508 --> 17:53.526
help. And people use me in the same way. Did you ever 
or have you ever experienced sexism from male

17:59.595 --> 18:04.422
professors?

18:10.493 --> 18:12.936
I guess it depends on how you define sexism.

18:15.720 --> 18:23.171
When I came to Texas A&M, I had a different 
experience than I had... Well, that's not true. I

18:24.713 --> 18:26.856
guess, let's go back to Alabama. I had a superb dean 
who gave me every opportunity. I could travel.

18:31.562 --> 18:33.725
There was nothing that I wanted to do that I could 
not do. But my salary was low. Well, I guess at one

18:37.230 --> 18:38.492
point, When I went on to the faculty of the School of 
Social Work, he asked me, and I was the first

18:39.147 --> 18:48.597
faculty member besides him, he asked me what rank I 
wanted. And my husband was an associate, and he was

18:48.617 --> 18:53.682
coming up for a full professorship. So I said, and I 
guess one would interpret this as,

18:53.702 --> 19:03.872
well, interpret it any way you wish. I said, no, let 
me, my husband's an associate and he's coming up

19:04.915 --> 19:16.426
for a full, so give me an associate rank and when he 
comes up for a full, then bring me up to a full. So

19:18.688 --> 19:25.035
the dean followed through on my wishes. My salary 
was less than people he was bringing in to start

19:26.516 --> 19:31.581
this new school. I had more, I worked side by side 
with him, and I was his chief confidant in the

19:32.303 --> 19:43.038
development of the school, and he literally could 
not have done it without me. I was also his dean of

19:44.761 --> 19:49.848
admissions, and so on and so forth, director of 
admissions. Then my husband, within about four or

19:50.969 --> 19:57.158
five months, became a full professor. So I 
expected that I would become a full professor, and

19:57.178 --> 20:00.623
I didn't. So the following year, I said to my dean, 
when are you going to make me a full professor? And

20:07.707 --> 20:10.211
he said, well, the time is not right. And I said, 
it'll never be righter. I said, put my name in. He

20:15.477 --> 20:16.639
said, well, I don't think you'll get it. I said, put 
my name in. And so I got it. And one of the vice

20:19.742 --> 20:28.213
presidents who I knew at the university said to the 
dean, how come you didn't make her a full professor

20:19.742 --> 20:28.213
to begin with? I don't know why the dean did that. 
But I think he didn't want to go up on my salary,

20:31.625 --> 20:41.214
which you automatically had to do, because he was 
trying to recruit somebody who was going to come

20:31.625 --> 20:41.214
high. So in a sense, you see, that was 
discriminating. While I was not discriminated

20:43.656 --> 20:49.481
against in terms of the work, I have always had 
trouble with salary. Then here, on

20:50.061 --> 20:58.268
a couple of occasions, my salary was low. And it was 
kept low. The only increases I got were when the

21:00.910 --> 21:05.414
dean gave it to me. And

21:05.434 --> 21:13.461
when Dr. Gaston came, he started moving my salary 
up. But I don't, I think in a strange way, this was

21:13.481 --> 21:20.147
not a reflection of my sex. It was a reflection of 
the fact that I tended to fight a department head.

21:27.998 --> 21:39.414
for the rights of younger faculty, because we had 
younger faculty who were not being moved up, and

21:27.998 --> 21:39.414
preference being given to others, and so I would go 
in and fight for them. And so this was what

21:41.277 --> 21:44.462
aggravated this person.

21:47.346 --> 21:50.510
It was not the fact that I was female, it was the fact 
that I was an irritant. And in a sense, Marcia, let

21:51.191 --> 21:56.419
me say that being married has its advantages. 
Because I have done this, I did this in Alabama, and

21:58.795 --> 22:10.930
I have been able to do this because if I lost my job, 
we always have my husband. So I felt it's given me

22:12.072 --> 22:17.218
more independence. That's good. What have been 
some problems in your home life due to your career?

22:23.165 --> 22:24.567
Or do you feel that there's been any? I

22:27.145 --> 22:43.067
think that probably academia, better than some 
professional areas, fits better in with family

22:27.145 --> 22:43.067
life. Certainly many women selected education 
early on because you could teach in elementary

22:43.087 --> 22:56.005
school and high school and still care for your 
family and that kind of thing. And so it

22:56.778 --> 23:03.805
has worked well. Only on a couple of occasions have 
I had

23:04.726 --> 23:13.275
some conflicts in terms of time. And I taught in 
Michigan right up to a very short time before my

23:14.697 --> 23:26.329
daughter was born and went back. about a month 
after. So that fit very well in. When I went to

23:34.730 --> 23:43.898
Alabama,

23:34.730 --> 23:43.898
I needed someone to care for my daughter while I was 
at school. And

23:43.958 --> 23:55.489
the situation there was a little bit different 
than Michigan, so for a semester I had some

23:43.958 --> 23:55.489
arranging to do. But it usually fit in very well, 
and children, young children, are pretty good as

23:55.840 --> 24:18.745
long as, if you're home, you can be working and 
writing after school, and you just have to water

23:55.840 --> 24:18.745
and feed children, and then they'll let you go 
ahead and do what you want to do. So it's worked out

24:20.187 --> 24:22.810
real well. What are some times in your life that you 
have felt discriminated against?

24:43.860 --> 24:48.044
Marcia, just the situations on salary.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.868
I really have not I've had people who have treated 
me differently because I was a woman. When I first

24:57.568 --> 25:08.760
came to Texas A&M, I was, I didn't realize that 
there were, I think there was one other woman full

24:57.568 --> 25:08.760
professor.

25:11.483 --> 25:18.210
And I was suddenly on a lot of doctoral committees. 
I would be

25:21.920 --> 25:48.602
grad rep in committee after committee all over 
campus and I didn't realize that this was an effort

25:21.920 --> 25:48.602
of Dr. Quincy to begin to get a woman on a committee 
because all committees and every committee I

25:21.920 --> 25:48.602
served on I was the only woman and on the committees 
until people got to know me well they would begin by

25:49.021 --> 26:17.442
asking me to ask questions first and usually on an 
exam the first questions go to the people within

25:49.021 --> 26:17.442
the department and certainly not to a grad rep and 
even when I was on a committee in another

25:49.021 --> 26:17.442
department because the student was minoring in 
sociology or something like this they would

25:49.021 --> 26:17.442
always turn to me first Then after a while, in some 
of the departments where I appeared on committee

26:17.911 --> 26:24.179
after committee, I would say, look, no more of 
this. And then after that, it was just like I was

26:25.260 --> 26:31.248
just another faculty member in their department. 
So I'm not too difficult. In the 1950s, women were

26:37.856 --> 26:42.602
viewed or stereotyped as being intuitive. 
emotional, independent, while men were viewed as

26:43.072 --> 26:48.479
more intelligent, independent, and rational. 
How do you feel about this? Do you feel that this has

26:50.622 --> 26:54.587
changed over the past 30 years? I

26:55.508 --> 27:02.818
guess so.

27:07.404 --> 27:11.830
When I started graduate school at North Carolina, 
I decided, because I had done so much research in

27:12.653 --> 27:24.165
the health area, in the sociology of health, that I 
would minor in public health. And I worked under a

27:24.185 --> 27:30.451
man named Cecil Sheps, who is head of health 
affairs at the University of North Carolina now.

27:31.952 --> 27:33.074
Very brilliant man. And

27:33.134 --> 27:41.462
he had had, I was not interested in assistantship. 
I had saved money, and I wanted to go through as

27:41.746 --> 27:45.231
quickly as possible. It's not really the best way 
to go through graduate school. It's much better to

27:48.635 --> 27:51.820
become a professor's assistant. You learn more, 
and also the professor takes a greater interest in

27:51.860 --> 27:59.470
you, may help with employment and that kind of 
thing.

28:02.194 --> 28:10.926
Dr. Sheps had had a woman assistant, and when I 
started coursework in the School of Public Health

28:02.194 --> 28:10.926
under him, He was kind of shy of me at first. And 
after about four weeks, he called me into his

28:17.899 --> 28:25.047
office and he said, will you accept an 
assistantship? And at the end of four weeks, I

28:27.189 --> 28:31.474
began to realize how expensive graduate school 
was. And so I told him I would. And he said, I want to

28:34.117 --> 28:39.023
apologize for not offering you an assistantship 
when you came. And he said, but I have just gone

28:39.965 --> 28:52.981
through two women assistants who, if I said one 
crossword or if I did not use all the niceties, they

28:39.965 --> 28:52.981
would fall apart and start to cry. And he said, I 
just didn't think I could stand that again. Sheps

28:56.585 --> 29:05.155
is the kind of person who, he didn't have a 
discriminatory bone in his body. But what he was

29:06.797 --> 29:09.280
reacting to were experiences that he had had. He 
had never objected to having a woman. It was just

29:15.391 --> 29:20.437
what he had experienced. And there were a lot of 
women who role-played women and would use a lot of

29:20.477 --> 29:34.834
excuses for not doing this. I think women do cry 
more readily than men. but if you're going to work

29:39.432 --> 29:43.798
with men, you better be able to take it. And this was 
not one of my problems. I could take it well. I might

29:50.267 --> 29:52.690
cry about other things. If I get angry, I either cry 
or storm. And the important thing is to storm, not

29:55.855 --> 29:59.179
cry. But he had a bad experience, and so he reacted 
to that. When he got to know me better, there was no

30:02.824 --> 30:06.990
problem. But he did not like to necessarily use all 
the nice. If he wanted something done, he didn't

30:11.829 --> 30:14.832
always want to say please. He didn't always want to 
say thank you. It was understood by the way he

30:16.475 --> 30:21.060
treated you and by the confidence that he had in 
you. And there are a lot of people who wanted all the

30:21.721 --> 30:25.787
rest. Have your achievements or your being a 
professor and having a career made you feel less

30:27.789 --> 30:35.759
feminine? No, no. And I like being a woman.

30:43.896 --> 30:44.277
I like it too. Women tend to hold lower 
expectations of what they can accomplish. Why do

30:50.225 --> 30:53.610
you feel that this is so? And have you ever had 
feelings or felt that because you're a woman you

30:53.690 --> 30:59.217
can't accomplish certain achievements? Marcia, 
I never did. And I think some of this is not

31:00.880 --> 31:06.207
necessarily...

31:10.405 --> 31:12.828
I don't know why this is true. I guess I came from a 
family where women had always done things. Now, my

31:19.338 --> 31:24.144
mother would say, well, she was robbed of certain 
opportunities. But some of the opportunities,

31:24.665 --> 31:28.070
she was robbed by her mother. But my mother, my 
grandmother had three factories. My grandfather

31:35.802 --> 31:38.566
and his brothers manufactured jewelry. 
Grandmother was off. She had mesh bag factories. I

31:41.671 --> 31:43.333
don't know whether you know what a mesh bag is. The 
little evening bags. Oh, yes. Well, these were

31:45.997 --> 31:51.345
very, very popular early on in the century. And my 
grandmother had three factories that

31:51.365 --> 31:55.191
manufactured them. And

31:55.211 --> 32:04.965
my mother, if she had stayed in Providence, Rhode 
Island, could have done things like that. She

32:05.131 --> 32:18.310
handled payroll as a young child, but she was very 
good at hat design, and she was offered a position

32:05.131 --> 32:18.310
in New York, and my grandmother wouldn't let her go 
because people thought of New York as being the big

32:05.131 --> 32:18.310
bad city. And so Mother always felt that her career 
was stifled, you see, because of being a woman. But

32:24.359 --> 32:30.227
it was her mother that really prevented her from 
doing this, not the chance to do it.

32:32.553 --> 32:35.797
Have you ever felt isolated because you were a 
woman?

32:41.185 --> 32:42.587
What do you mean by isolated? Set apart from others 
or that, you know, in the department you were just

32:43.388 --> 32:50.858
kind of set aside because you were a woman? No, not, 
except for the business, the exams.

33:00.346 --> 33:08.753
I think a lot depends on how you role-play in your 
career and how... I

33:09.574 --> 33:16.259
don't know. There has been an awful lot of talk 
about the role of women and the problems of women.

33:22.445 --> 33:27.089
And I think that after a while you can believe that 
all of this is true. And I know for some women it has

33:27.189 --> 33:29.010
been true. But it's also true for some men.

33:35.064 --> 33:42.654
For a long time, departments were really antsy 
about employing single men. And so really lots of

33:44.696 --> 33:59.715
departments discriminated against single men 
because if you have a married man, you knew that he

33:44.696 --> 33:59.715
wasn't going to be off and running to another job if 
he didn't like the way things were going. So there

34:00.455 --> 34:08.143
are all kinds of factors that affect both males and 
females in the job market. That's interesting.

34:13.389 --> 34:16.913
What effect did your parents have on you becoming a 
professor? You said that they were real

34:17.433 --> 34:18.955
supportive. Have they always been supportive in 
everything that you did? Yes, they were always

34:23.720 --> 34:25.041
supportive. Always supportive in education.

34:29.800 --> 34:58.930
uh... always supported in giving me time to uh...

34:29.800 --> 34:58.930
to uh... to study uh... limiting limiting the 
uh... the kinds of things your a child is expected

34:29.800 --> 34:58.930
to do around the house when you have studies to do 
and all that but uh... I think my father thought

34:59.821 --> 35:05.389
very strongly about education and so did my 
mother. That's great.

35:10.878 --> 35:14.183
How have you found that men and women are 
evaluated? Are men and women evaluated

35:14.683 --> 35:19.771
differently in terms of their work and their 
achievements?

35:22.295 --> 35:25.339
Oh, I think they can be. And just because I have not 
had

35:30.871 --> 35:38.880
difficult experiences doesn't mean that other 
women have not.

35:38.900 --> 35:49.632
I think that there are positions where, as changes 
began to occur, women were in a sense isolated. I

35:49.732 --> 35:57.621
had a friend at North Carolina who became the first 
woman executive with a major insurance company in

35:49.732 --> 35:57.621
Hartford, Connecticut. and she could carry her 
own. She

36:00.980 --> 36:18.192
was a very objective kind of person, but for a 
while, until they really got to know her, she was

36:00.980 --> 36:18.192
kind of isolated. I think that you can interpret 
everything everyone says as being against a

36:18.509 --> 36:25.961
woman. They say this to me because I'm a woman. They 
may say these things if you are a man, and you've got

36:28.505 --> 36:33.113
to learn to differentiate.

36:35.537 --> 36:43.690
And also, I think that there is a normalcy of 
behavior that sometimes women who are so enamored

36:44.210 --> 36:50.296
of freedom and the feminist movement miss. For 
example, I have had colleagues who will never

36:51.057 --> 36:57.704
discuss the fact that they're married. In fact, 
you wouldn't even know they were married unless

36:58.405 --> 37:02.569
they happened to tell you. I mean, unless 
something happened and it came to your attention.

37:06.473 --> 37:09.316
They may have children, they will never discuss 
their children. Now, males Always do. I mean,

37:12.712 --> 37:15.477
they'll talk about their children, they'll talk 
about their wife. So that women who

37:16.739 --> 37:22.808
characteristically don't do this stand out as 
different. I mean, with older faculty who always

37:24.531 --> 37:34.386
talk about their children and talk about this and 
talk about that, we all know about each other. And

37:35.047 --> 37:38.753
for a woman to come on the scene and never do this, 
Why do you think they don't talk about their

37:40.235 --> 37:43.019
children? Well, what they say is that if I talk 
about this, then they're going to judge me as a

37:43.239 --> 37:48.446
woman. Instead of seeing this as part of the 
behavior, as just human behavior, to talk about

37:50.189 --> 37:57.419
your family and so on. And the interesting thing is 
most of these women have husbands who were really

37:57.479 --> 38:03.567
exceptional. And I think it's a shame not not to 
share your total life. When you came to A&M, were

38:16.744 --> 38:22.192
there any women's organizations such as now? No, 
no. In fact, I was in this research program, and I

38:24.375 --> 38:33.208
was housed in a little temporary building where 
Blocker is. And I just assumed there were tons of

38:33.762 --> 38:37.526
women all over. And because we did not have a 
faculty club, the fact that we do not have a faculty

38:37.546 --> 38:44.633
club I think is very limiting. I mean, a real 
faculty club, not a room in the bottom of or

38:45.174 --> 38:51.420
something like that, but a real faculty club. 
Because in the faculty club, both male and female

38:51.441 --> 39:01.491
faculty are seen in informal occasions by each 
other. And you do family kinds of things if there is

39:02.247 --> 39:06.873
a restaurant. At the University of Alabama, we had 
a marvelous faculty club in an old mansion. And we

39:14.221 --> 39:17.485
had a lovely dining room. And the cook was a gourmet 
cook and published cookbooks. And there were

39:22.211 --> 39:23.653
weddings there. There were all kinds of things. 
And people got to see each other in a variety of

39:24.794 --> 39:29.740
situations. I just assumed there were women all 
over this campus. And it was a big shock to me later

39:34.147 --> 39:39.034
to find out that there were not. Now, I had signs, 
but I never read them right. Because I had a lot of

39:43.640 --> 39:53.613
students who would come to see me, particularly 
male students, that were having problems and

39:43.640 --> 39:53.613
wanted to talk to someone. And there were so few 
people to talk to. for whatever reason, it always

39:59.437 --> 40:02.923
seems easier to talk to a woman. So any students 
that I had in class very often would come to see me.

40:08.531 --> 40:14.281
And some of their friends would often, you know, go 
see Dr. Shaffer. And I really was not running a

40:14.301 --> 40:17.205
casework. And I should have recognized the fact 
that we also didn't have adequate counseling and

40:26.588 --> 40:29.753
that there were very few women on campus. Have you 
ever been a member of NOW or any other women's

40:29.913 --> 40:33.979
organizations? No, I've spoken to NOW on several 
occasions because one of my former students is

40:34.100 --> 40:44.175
very active in that organization. What types of 
changes in favor of women have occurred at A&M

40:44.830 --> 40:57.849
besides the hiring of more women?

41:02.376 --> 41:04.839
Well, I think the hiring of women has been 
important. But with the growth of what I would

41:05.440 --> 41:10.247
distinguish as the new faculty, Most of these 
people came from parts of the country where there

41:11.189 --> 41:21.278
were more women on the faculty

41:11.189 --> 41:21.278
than Texas A&M had previously had. And so they 
accepted women without any difficulty. And also

41:27.685 --> 41:40.977
the fact that a lot of people in academia have wives 
who have degrees or have advanced education in

41:27.685 --> 41:40.977
some area, and so they accept more readily women in 
the marketplace than, let's say, in corporate

41:41.497 --> 41:47.282
America. But it's interesting when you read or 
listen to people active in feminist

41:47.302 --> 42:10.423
organizations because they act as if women never 
held important positions in our society, and yet

41:47.302 --> 42:10.423
women have held important positions for a long, 
into the last century. not as many, but certainly

42:11.281 --> 42:16.387
numbers of them. And at this point in time, most 
women must be in the market place at the same time

42:16.407 --> 42:28.221
they are married, or else large numbers of 
families could not be middle class. Do you feel

42:29.362 --> 42:34.588
that these women in the workforce have obstacles 
to overcome? I think there are obstacles. I don't

42:39.256 --> 42:43.836
think there is a question that
