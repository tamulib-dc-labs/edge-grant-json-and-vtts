WEBVTT

00:07.355 --> 00:16.509
After that had gone on for about two or three 
months, I knew that something was basically wrong

00:07.355 --> 00:16.509
and I wasn't happy. A man's not happy that he's 
working, you better look at it. So I went in to see my

00:20.715 --> 00:33.615
superior, Mr. Cottingham, the sailor manager, 
and he took me in to Lamar Fleming, who was the Top

00:34.000 --> 00:35.803
man with Addison Clayton. Will Clayton at that 
time was appointed Secretary of State by the

00:35.843 --> 00:44.498
President Roosevelt. But Lamar Fleming listened 
to me and he said, Dick, you'll always have a job

00:44.518 --> 00:53.113
with Addison Clayton. But circumstances being 
what they are, I'd get out of the cotton butters

00:53.133 --> 00:58.382
too. And I did. Did you, in 1937, did you and your 
classmates anticipate World War II? As I said,

01:06.742 --> 01:24.105
when I went there, went to Europe, and I saw what was 
going on in Germany, Luther Jones, Bailey Conner

01:06.742 --> 01:24.105
and I and all of us were very upset, very concerned 
about it. Let's see, other campus traditions,

01:24.676 --> 01:31.664
silver taps, was it held and if so where and what did 
it mean? Held then just about the way it's held

01:32.665 --> 01:35.848
today. Had a military walk there, back of the YMCA, 
right in front of Old Main and it was a very

01:35.888 --> 01:48.121
significant occasion. Nothing more beautiful in 
the world. When you hear that silver taps at night

01:53.617 --> 02:04.833
and you think about the individual, we usually 
knew all our old classmates and those things that

01:53.617 --> 02:04.833
happened. We didn't have many though, 
fortunately. One or two were killed in accidents

02:08.658 --> 02:12.163
and so forth. Did anybody ever act silly? Was the 
behavior of everyone appropriate? Did they take

02:21.736 --> 02:23.539
silver taps seriously? Oh, absolutely. No one 
would have thought of doing anything that would

02:25.754 --> 02:46.955
mar

02:25.754 --> 02:46.955
the ceremony that they would be grabbed 
physically and taken out and handled proper way.

02:47.056 --> 02:48.497
Was muster held then? Must have was held then, but 
it was not as significant as it is today. Do you

02:54.475 --> 02:55.336
remember where? Well, frankly,

02:57.800 --> 03:03.129
I don't. It was held, I think, on the drill field. 
I'm not sure. I don't know. What about Bonfire? We

03:14.380 --> 03:22.011
always had the bonfire but there again I didn't 
take part in it actually because of my job. Where

03:24.515 --> 03:25.336
was it held? Where'd they burn it? Right there on 
the drill field. And what was in it?

03:37.077 --> 03:43.905
just wherever we could find stuff that would burn, 
you know, trees. Was there any kind of structure

03:43.925 --> 03:48.310
that was quite often at the top of the bonfire? I 
wasn't that close to it, really, to know just how it

03:48.670 --> 04:01.445
was put together and whether it was done by, mainly 
by students or by who was hired to do it or got it

03:48.670 --> 04:01.445
done. I think it was the students mainly. I wanted 
to pour it actually into that. Let's see. Now these

04:08.887 --> 04:12.571
may not relate to your date. Hollywood, Uncle 
Ed's, Running Wood and Water. Did those? All of

04:19.780 --> 04:20.882
them were familiar. And I had friends I know who 
participated, but I didn't. What was Hollywood?

04:28.171 --> 04:28.431
I don't. I just don't remember the name of it. I 
presume it was a little nightclub where people

04:30.962 --> 04:39.936
could go and put a quarter in a nickel machine and 
dance and drink a little beer on the side of

04:30.962 --> 04:39.936
something. Was Uncle Ed's? Uncle Ed's Seminole.

04:45.003 --> 04:49.550
As I recall in my recollection, what others said 
about it. I don't know. All right. Explain Aggie

04:53.456 --> 04:54.938
spirit. What is Aggie spirit? Well, the Aggie 
spirit is indefinable, as Buckwaters would say,

04:59.022 --> 05:06.754
pretty well. Except if you're an Aggie, you know 
what it is. I think I mentioned to you a little

05:11.681 --> 05:19.933
earlier that the Aggie spirit probably 
identifies me with true grit. It identifies with

05:21.876 --> 05:28.506
the A&M man, the Charles and the great things that 
happened to him throughout his career at A&M. Each

05:35.951 --> 05:41.279
man had his own separate memories. Mine revolve 
around the individuals that I love there, like

05:42.221 --> 05:54.579
Frank Anderson, like Finn Penworthy, like Buddy 
Morgan, like T.O. Walden, like Hank Ashford,

06:01.088 --> 06:21.045
He never, McQuillan, Mike McQuillan, there was no 
greater A&M man than Mike McQuillan and what he did

06:01.088 --> 06:21.045
for A&M has never been properly identified and a 
book ought to be written about Mike. He was a

06:21.065 --> 06:30.994
Scotchman, he was a class of 21, he was dedicated to 
building a former student association and later

06:31.548 --> 06:46.466
stepped down to take over and be the first 
president of the Development Foundation because

06:31.548 --> 06:46.466
he saw how great the Development Foundation might 
be and what it would mean to A&M. So he took down to

06:47.187 --> 06:52.293
take over that leadership and put it on the map. And 
I never knew anyone who was more dedicated to A&M

06:52.313 --> 07:00.222
than Mike. as our first, not our first, but our 
second or third association secretary. Of

07:09.307 --> 07:15.257
course, Ike Ashman, one of our first, if not the 
first, of the official association. I know there

07:15.337 --> 07:23.830
were student organizations

07:15.337 --> 07:23.830
before that, and we had several presidents. Those 
I didn't know, but starting with Ike Ashman on the

07:23.850 --> 07:29.719
back, I knew practically all of them. and know that 
fine contribution. So what did it mean to you, what

07:36.128 --> 07:42.375
has it meant to your life that you attended A&M? 
Well, A&M has

07:44.537 --> 07:56.790
very special, very special benefits to any young 
man. Number one, it offers two careers that offers

07:59.602 --> 08:27.753
whatever you want to specialize in and you've got a 
wide variety from agriculture to petroleum to

07:59.602 --> 08:27.753
medicine to you name it to aspire to a degree which 
you also back in old days special and you still have

07:59.602 --> 08:27.753
it throughout Corps cadets an opportunity to get a 
commission in the armed services. To me back in old

08:27.773 --> 08:29.355
days not only helped me get through A&M because it 
paid me a little money, but it also gave me

08:29.993 --> 08:39.524
leadership training that I might not have gotten 
anywhere else. I was fortunate enough to get into

08:40.765 --> 08:58.245
the lead cavalry service where I learned to love 
horses, learned to ride well, and learned to

08:40.765 --> 08:58.245
admire

08:40.765 --> 08:58.245
the service and what it stood for. And it served me 
well as I went when World War I came around. Instead

09:04.149 --> 09:15.984
of going in as an enlisted man and going through all 
that tomfoolery, I immediately stepped in as an

09:04.149 --> 09:15.984
officer and was called to active duty with the Air 
Force. And I went from one very important

09:16.004 --> 09:26.578
assignment to another, commandant cadets, 
director and executive officer of a base.

09:27.807 --> 09:50.609
Wangella Staff School, the Air Staff School, 
Overseas, Executive Officer of the 38th Bomb

09:27.807 --> 09:50.609
Group, and I moved from Lengarian Gulf to Okinawa 
and had fantastic memories and opportunities and

09:27.807 --> 09:50.609
dangers that I came through. But that's just one 
thing. Of course, your friends you make there, I

09:57.811 --> 09:59.614
think stay with you with life. This coming 
October, here in Corpus Christi, a class of 37, of

10:00.875 --> 10:13.994
which I was a member, will meet for its, what year 
will that be?

10:17.018 --> 10:17.719
It's... 61. 61 years. Anniversary

10:21.204 --> 10:27.092
meeting. and we'll have quite a turnout. But we're 
working right now. I've got a list upstairs. I've

10:35.831 --> 10:47.362
got through Connie at the Association of Former 
Students Office with labels to all present living

10:35.831 --> 10:47.362
members of the class of 37. They'll all get a 
special letter from our committee down here for

10:47.382 --> 10:55.270
Aggies from the class of 37. In addition to that, 
we'll call Each one of us, every one of them that we

10:57.447 --> 11:05.319
know, and we're going to have quite a three-day 
party and an interesting time. So fellowship and

11:06.521 --> 11:21.323
the romance of the Aggie ring should never be to any 
young student who's contemplating whether or not

11:06.521 --> 11:21.323
to go to A&M or try to go to A&M. That ring has meant 
more to me in my business life and my social life,

11:26.033 --> 11:38.571
and my friendships, and most anything that, you 
know, I don't believe in wearing jewelry.

11:40.474 --> 11:55.416
I wouldn't advise any woman to wear a big diamond 
ring or a Rolex watch or anything, but I just had one

11:40.474 --> 11:55.416
of my best friends slap down in her garage, you may 
have read about it in Houston, She was the 78th

11:55.852 --> 12:04.624
woman who'd done that and the jewelry was stolen 
from her and she was kicked in the face and brutally

11:55.852 --> 12:04.624
treated. But this ring, just like one of the most 
interesting instances, was during the war. I was

12:13.937 --> 12:18.063
moving my 38th Bomb Group from Lingerie and Guff. I 
had orders to move it to Okinawa and Okinawa, we

12:24.843 --> 12:32.332
were to move and operate off of Yontan Strip, the 
biggest, busiest airstrip in the world at the

12:24.843 --> 12:32.332
time. So I went with my orders and took a sergeant 
with me and went up as a forward echelon to find a

12:33.193 --> 12:44.986
bivouac area, a new bivouac area, and prepare for 
the move. And I got up there, I went into Bomber

12:45.928 --> 12:53.196
Command and find a buddy major there who took me in 
and he said, well, here's a map of the island,

12:53.767 --> 13:01.618
Colonel Connolly, and let's see where the 38th 
Bomb Group's going to be. He said, hey, I'm down the

13:02.138 --> 13:05.062
strip, right at the end of the strip. Well, yeah, 
yeah, you are. You're very convenient to the

13:06.084 --> 13:08.327
field. It's the perfect spot for you. I said, 
Major, who made that decision? He said, I'm not

13:17.098 --> 13:20.723
about to put my troops at the end of that runway. 
They know planes are jettisoned and don't Bombs

13:23.973 --> 13:29.157
jettison sometimes, and sometimes they don't 
make it off the end of that runaway. They just make

13:29.177 --> 13:31.059
it off the end of the runaway. I said, I'm going to 
put my troops there. He said, sir, this is a tight

13:33.962 --> 13:36.904
situation. We've got lots of coming in here. He 
said, I can't change that. I said, well, who makes

13:40.967 --> 13:42.589
that decision? He said, well, you'll have to see 
Colonel Delbert Ward, sir. I said, well, where's

13:47.913 --> 13:49.955
Colonel Delbert Ward? He said, well, he's a bomber 
commandant, Air Force commandant. Fifth Air

13:54.247 --> 13:56.549
Force Commander, well, you take me to him. He said, 
well, I'll be glad to get you over there. So he ran

13:59.733 --> 14:00.814
with me. He kept me over there. Fortunately, I 
caught Delvin Ward in at his tent there. Walked in,

14:06.840 --> 14:08.702
introduced myself to him. First thing I saw was his 
A&M ring. First thing he saw was my A&M ring. Well,

14:14.969 --> 14:16.230
sit down, Dick. So we talked about A&M. We had 
coffee together. We were friends immediately and

14:23.339 --> 14:24.441
He said, what's your problem? What can I do for you? 
And I told him. He looked at it. He said, my God, we

14:29.728 --> 14:32.812
did make a mistake, didn't we? He said, come with 
me. Put me in his Jeep. We rode around the island. He

14:36.918 --> 14:44.768
found me a spot, a high spot on the island about 10 
minutes from the strip where we had a great breeze

14:36.918 --> 14:44.768
overlooking the China Sea. I had the best spot on 
the island. I couldn't accomplish it without his

14:47.893 --> 14:50.096
help. He wouldn't have done that for just anybody. 
He was too busy. I've got a book by the other ward I

14:54.035 --> 14:57.420
want you to read. I'll give it to you. All right. The 
last question that I have scheduled is a very

14:59.083 --> 15:04.171
serious one. What feelings do you hold in your 
heart now for Texas A&M?

15:10.621 --> 15:21.578
Well, I spend a good part of my time each

15:10.621 --> 15:21.578
year working for A&M. And I say working for A&M, 
directly or indirectly. Because of my long

15:27.286 --> 15:49.753
association with A&M through the former student 
association, through Corpus Christi A&M Club,

15:27.286 --> 15:49.753
through many other areas that I've worked in, I 
have called some mommas and dads and students.

15:49.773 --> 15:51.936
They want to get this child in A&M. What can I do? 
Well, I can only encourage them. I can only, what I

15:55.568 --> 16:03.720
do in every case, I'll just give you one example 
that occurred this year that I'm very proud of. It

16:04.761 --> 16:17.740
was a young Hispanic who came to me, and he happened 
to be the daughter of a nurse who had taken care of my

16:04.761 --> 16:17.740
wife when she had cancer. Wonderful, wonderful 
woman. And this was her only son. She did have two

16:23.495 --> 16:27.238
daughters who'd gone on and done well in college. 
And he had gotten to high school. He was a gang

16:33.244 --> 16:35.346
member his first two years. And had done extremely 
poorly, although he had, in math, he'd done

16:36.548 --> 16:43.635
extremely well. He had a very good mind. And I 
checked up on him. But he came to see me, and he wrote

16:51.316 --> 17:05.110
a letter, told me that he'd met a gang member, but 
he'd fought his way out of that because of the

16:51.316 --> 17:05.110
pressure his mother and his sisters and friends 
had put on him, and he'd seen the light. And he had,

17:05.751 --> 17:09.735
thank God, he said, it wasn't with pistols, I did it 
with my fist. And he said, I want to go to A&M. I'm

17:12.918 --> 17:20.125
interested in math, and I know I can excel if I have 
the opportunity, but I know because of my first two

17:12.918 --> 17:20.125
years were poor, I'm going to have a hard time 
getting in. But his junior and his senior year, he

17:24.063 --> 17:26.907
did excel. We talked to his math teacher. His math 
teacher said, this young man has unusual ability.

17:36.020 --> 17:40.387
He can be a great mathematician. And we need to 
somehow get him in there. I got ahold of Jim

17:43.952 --> 17:47.678
Reynolds and Pam. And somehow, he made it. And he's 
doing extremely well. He's in the Corps. But the

17:54.856 --> 18:01.547
main thing is he's a role model now that we can use in 
these high schools. Oh, yes. And it's great. Have I

18:04.813 --> 18:08.198
left anything out that you particularly wanted to 
share?

18:11.404 --> 18:16.352
Well, there's several things that I might talk 
about. In fact, I got a whole bunch of stuff I pulled

18:17.378 --> 18:25.085
out of a fire here that we go through, but one thing 
we mentioned was the cotton ball. They no longer

18:25.946 --> 18:27.527
have a cotton ball. And cotton sort of became the 
way it was. King cotton in Texas is no longer king

18:33.433 --> 18:41.880
cotton, but more and more, they're planting more 
and more cotton. But that occasion of the cotton

18:41.900 --> 18:46.845
ball was a great event on the campus. And I hated to 
see it disappear. And I wrote to her about it at the

18:50.349 --> 18:53.472
time. And that's one thing I might mention. The 
other thing, I noticed that you've done some work

18:58.616 --> 19:04.941
in your career with the Danforth Foundation. I was 
one of the fortunate ones who was a Danforth Summer

19:04.961 --> 19:17.592
Fellowship winner with a man named Horn, Jeff 
Horn, in my class. two of us were selected because

19:18.061 --> 19:21.945
they couldn't make a decision between us. And so 
they asked permission from Danforth for two to go

19:22.566 --> 19:27.031
represent A&M. That's some of them. That was a 
fantastic experience. I don't know that they're

19:30.915 --> 19:32.777
still doing that or not. I don't think so. But 
somehow, someone ought to get with the, you know,

19:34.359 --> 19:41.387
that recently Danforth was sold and bought by 
another company. Well, and the Danforth

19:41.407 --> 19:45.952
Foundation gave all of its money to Washington 
University St. Louis. Darn it. Because they were

19:49.178 --> 19:52.182
doing great work with those summer programs. Oh, 
I'll tell you. They took a group of outstanding

19:53.143 --> 19:59.390
young men from the land grant colleges across the 
nation. They took us into St. Louis, and we worked

20:00.151 --> 20:08.882
for six weeks, if I recall correctly, or maybe it 
was two weeks in St. Louis. But we worked two or

20:10.003 --> 20:18.814
three days in the sales department, two or three 
days in the research department, two or three days

20:10.003 --> 20:18.814
in the accounting department, and so forth. we got 
a background of what a business is. And then Mr.

20:23.847 --> 20:34.099
Danforth himself was the founder of the American 
Youth Foundation camp at Shelton, Michigan. Been

20:34.119 --> 20:34.860
there. And we were there for at least a month. And he 
brought in every week or twice a week some

20:39.245 --> 20:48.936
outstanding individuals in the business 
religious or government, political world, and

20:50.097 --> 21:06.642
with us, who chowed with us, who swam with us, who 
talked to us over the bonfire every night. And Mr.

21:07.503 --> 21:12.490
Danforth himself led that. And it was one of the 
great experiences of my life And no company could

21:19.865 --> 21:25.771
do anything greater than to continue that. If 
Danforth can no longer do it, we, you and I, should

21:26.252 --> 21:35.061
find some company to do something similar. Oh, I 
agree. Because it would build the leaders in that

21:36.342 --> 21:40.426
group. I still have touch with some of them.

21:46.793 --> 21:47.273
One of them, is in Hamburg, Louisiana. His name is 
Lucian Laborde. He was recently given an honorary

21:52.966 --> 21:59.512
degree by LSU. And we still stay in touch. He's one 
of the great men of the South. And his brother's the

22:07.158 --> 22:08.800
same way. But others I know have done equally well. 
And we can give great credit to William A. Stanton

22:14.225 --> 22:18.188
for them. That is one thing I might mention. I've 
talked about Penny and what our intramural

22:23.228 --> 22:28.535
program meant to us back in those days. I don't know 
why this can't be expanded more than maybe it's

22:29.136 --> 22:37.006
being done. I'm not familiar what's being done, 
but if we had the kind of leader Penny did, he made it

22:37.106 --> 22:43.855
interesting. He made it something we wanted to do. 
There's so many activities we can get into and it's

22:47.969 --> 22:54.215
also leadership training. But what I'd like to see 
more done and more attention given is to what is

22:54.235 --> 23:17.959
being done through the Memorial Student Center 
with our many programs, student programs that Jim

22:54.235 --> 23:17.959
Reynolds-Hedge is doing such a fantastic job with 
Jane Bailey and his group. I don't know whether

23:18.344 --> 23:46.714
around 750 different student programs if I recall 
correctly last I heard involving many thousands

23:18.344 --> 23:46.714
of students in different activities each one of 
them may be a different thing maybe it's stamp

23:18.344 --> 23:46.714
collecting maybe it's it could be anything or 
whatever their interests are they can follow it

23:47.099 --> 24:07.878
and have some student leadership and back up 
through Jim's staff to help them raise money,

23:47.099 --> 24:07.878
whatever they need, and organize and do something 
useful and something worthwhile that they'll

23:47.099 --> 24:07.878
always treasure. And this sort of leadership 
training, to me, today must take place That's

24:15.770 --> 24:19.453
within a mural of leadership and training. After 
all, we're limited now in our corps. Our corps is

24:25.599 --> 24:27.620
doing a fantastic job. And no one could say more 
things about the corps than I do. I treasure it. But

24:40.151 --> 24:44.595
Earl Rudder was right indefinitely. There was no 
way our institution could continue to grow as long

24:44.913 --> 24:56.649
as we had a limited 2,000 contracts. And there was 
hell of that whether you were 40,000 students or

24:56.669 --> 25:00.755
6,000 students. And it was unfair to the student 
body to get them in and make them take two years of

25:00.895 --> 25:12.912
hard training as a freshman and sophomore in Bull 
Tech and then not offer them the a reward of being

25:13.313 --> 25:20.060
able at least to hopefully get a contract with the 
government. That limited the odds so much that it

25:20.481 --> 25:41.683
was taken away from my enrollment and hurting A&M 
badly and this was changed and it was changed in

25:20.481 --> 25:41.683
such a way that it still kept our core in an elite 
process and it is an elite organization. One that

25:41.900 --> 25:52.365
we can all take tremendous pride in and want to 
preserve and want to honor and want to continue to

25:41.900 --> 25:52.365
keep on the top shelf of A&M.
