00:02.360 --> 00:15.118
OK, this is an interview with Dr. Jim Adams by 
Matthew Moran on the 20th of April 1993 at Cref

00:02.360 --> 00:15.118
Brazos Baptist Association concerning the 
effect of the civil rights movement on the

00:02.360 --> 00:15.118
Southern Baptist Church. Dr. Adams, I'm asking 
you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas A&M oral

00:15.900 --> 00:22.269
history collection in the university archives. 
Is that all right with you? That's fine. Thank you.

00:27.616 --> 00:28.738
OK, Dr. Adams, where were you born? I was born in 
Temple, Texas in 1929. OK. And did you grow up in

00:31.998 --> 00:35.482
Temple also? No. My father was a railroad 
engineer, was working in Palestine, Texas

00:37.003 --> 00:42.588
shortly thereafter. And I grew up in Palestine in 
East Texas. Where did you go to college? Went to

00:49.495 --> 00:51.637
Baylor University. OK. What years did you attend? 
I was in Baylor 1948 through 1952. And where did you

00:57.983 --> 00:59.164
go to seminary? Went to seminary in Fort Worth, 
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary,

00:59.532 --> 01:04.597
Fort Worth, Texas. In what years did you attend 
seminary? I was in seminary in 1952 through 1956

01:07.080 --> 01:14.427
the first time. Okay. Where were you living in the 
1960s? In the 1960s, I was living in South Houston,

01:18.171 --> 01:27.160
Texas, and then Victoria, Texas. Okay, what was 
your position in the church? I was pastor of First

01:31.031 --> 01:38.940
Baptist Church, South Houston, Texas, and pastor 
of First Baptist Church, Victoria, Texas. Okay,

01:38.960 --> 01:44.426
what was the ethnic breakdown of the communities, 
first in Houston and then in Victoria? In Houston,

01:44.446 --> 01:56.860
South Houston, South Houston is an independent 
city, though a suburb area of Houston, and the

01:44.446 --> 01:56.860
ethnic breakdown makeup of the community was 
largely Anglo and Hispanic. Okay, what about in

02:03.629 --> 02:05.071
Victoria? In Victoria, largely Anglo with a very 
good-sized Hispanic community and a smaller

02:05.612 --> 02:16.867
black community. Okay, what was ethnic breakdown 
of the church? In South Houston, we had a few

02:27.957 --> 02:34.567
Most of the Hispanic people were in a mission that 
our church sponsored on the east side of the town.

02:34.587 --> 02:39.034
So was that mission 100% Hispanic then? Some of our 
Anglo people from our church worked in the

02:39.174 --> 02:42.680
mission.

02:45.865 --> 02:50.232
So I would say that it was probably 98% Hispanic. 
What about the pastor of that mission? He was

02:52.555 --> 02:53.376
Hispanic. He was Hispanic, too? Uh-huh. OK, how 
would you characterize the race relations in the

02:56.729 --> 02:58.591
church. Race relations in the South Houston 
church with the mission people was good. And as I

03:08.140 --> 03:14.325
said, occasionally we did have some Hispanic 
people who were in our congregation too. I cannot

03:15.727 --> 03:25.656
recall any problems, but by the large, they were 
two separate congregations, of course. What

03:26.581 --> 03:27.943
about in Victoria? What was the ethnic breakdown 
of the church there? Our church was largely Anglo.

03:35.913 --> 03:40.239
We did have a number of Hispanic children who 
attended our church. And we had one black member in

03:41.200 --> 03:45.906
the church in Victoria while I was there. Was there 
any mission church in Victoria? Yes, there was a

03:49.972 --> 03:52.315
Hispanic mission. There was no black mission. 
There were two or three very strong black

03:55.437 --> 04:03.186
congregations in the city, and we had very good 
relationships with them. Were they Southern

04:03.667 --> 04:05.149
Baptist churches? No, the black congregations 
were not Southern Baptist. As I recall, the

04:08.793 --> 04:15.401
predominant or the largest black congregation 
was the National Baptist Church. Okay, and they

04:16.182 --> 04:18.084
had black pastors? Yes.

04:21.508 --> 04:24.111
How would you characterize the Southern Baptist 
Convention and their position on race relations

04:24.513 --> 04:30.301
within the church. The convention position,

04:30.321 --> 04:50.368
and I think I'm correct in this, was that our 
churches needed to do more to establish better

04:30.321 --> 04:50.368
racial relations and to be more open to other 
racial groups becoming a part of churches that

04:51.023 --> 04:54.969
were largely Anglo churches in those days. Okay. 
So what was the role of minorities in the church?

05:00.397 --> 05:02.720
Was it mainly just membership in the church? Or did 
they assume a more active role? Well, the

05:06.986 --> 05:16.019
minorities were such minorities that they did not 
have a great effect in the church, as I recall. The

05:16.861 --> 05:18.583
Hispanic community and South Houston was very 
small. The one black member that we had in Victoria

05:21.741 --> 05:26.328
was very active in the church choir. Okay. How did 
the other people view that black member in

05:29.151 --> 05:34.138
Victoria? There was no problem whatsoever in the 
church in Victoria. If there had been a larger

05:39.165 --> 05:48.317
segment of another racial group, it might have 
been different, but with a black member who

05:39.165 --> 05:48.317
happened to be a lady, there was no problem at all. 
Do you think it would have been different had that

05:48.905 --> 05:51.368
black member been a man? I don't think so, no. Okay. 
Did any black churches in that time fall under the

05:58.397 --> 06:02.062
domain of the Southern Baptist Convention? There 
were a few black churches during that time. I

06:05.126 --> 06:12.236
recall, I believe I'm correct, there was one 
church in Corpus Christi that affiliated with the

06:05.126 --> 06:12.236
Southern Baptist Convention. Of course, since 
then, there have been large numbers of black

06:14.048 --> 06:20.278
congregations that have affiliated with the 
Southern Baptist Convention. Okay, and those

06:20.298 --> 06:23.283
black churches then had black pastors too? Yes. 
Were there any minority congregations with white

06:24.505 --> 06:27.810
pastors?

06:30.354 --> 06:34.721
I was not aware of any in either of those two 
communities during those years, no. What about

06:35.162 --> 06:39.428
white congregations with black or Hispanic 
pastors? I don't recall any. How did the church and

06:41.740 --> 06:49.510
Southern Baptist Convention view black 
ministers who led the civil rights movement such

06:41.740 --> 06:49.510
as Martin Luther King? I think probably that would 
depend on individuals within the churches as well

06:49.530 --> 07:01.125
as individual pastors and in the way that they 
looked at the civil rights movement. There was

07:01.145 --> 07:09.756
still in those days a good amount of prejudice, but 
I would say by the large,

07:13.330 --> 07:18.255
I'd say probably most of the pastors were 
sympathetic to the civil rights movement. There

07:18.275 --> 07:25.543
were some things that happened that they probably 
didn't like, as oftentimes happen when change is

07:18.275 --> 07:25.543
occurring like that. What would you say were some 
of those things that they didn't like? Oh, I have an

07:30.389 --> 07:37.296
idea that there was still a racial or color 
prejudice among some of the people. And some of

07:38.103 --> 07:43.431
them felt like that, well, you know, it was the 
right thing to do, but they were moving too fast.

07:44.493 --> 07:46.577
Some of them may have had that attitude. Of course, 
if they had been in the minority group, they

07:47.438 --> 07:52.125
wouldn't have felt that way probably. Right. How 
did the Ku Klux Klan affect the church? I cannot

07:58.075 --> 08:04.465
recall either in Houston or in Victoria that the 
Klan was... active in those communities during

08:04.816 --> 08:08.280
the time that I was pastor there. Did you ever hear 
of any experiences where the Klan had affected

08:08.981 --> 08:12.765
another church? Primarily just in news articles, 
reading about it, or perhaps on television. Okay.

08:22.716 --> 08:27.822
Kneel-ins, where people would kneel in 
segregated churches, grew in popularity in the

08:22.716 --> 08:27.822
1960s. Were there any kneel-ins that you 
encountered? No, I do not recall any. Did you ever

08:32.857 --> 08:34.940
hear of any that had happened at all? No. After I 
left Victoria, this was getting on into the 70s,

08:36.322 --> 08:48.320
though, it was the end of the 60s, when I moved from 
Victoria to a church in Texarkana. There had been

08:49.222 --> 08:56.052
two churches that had been set on fire in 
Texarkana, and as I went to the church where I

08:56.588 --> 09:12.582
served in Texarkana, which was the Beach Street 
First Baptist Church on the Arkansas side, the

08:56.588 --> 09:12.582
church had been actively raising funds to help 
rebuild the two black churches that had been

08:56.588 --> 09:12.582
burned. Who burned the churches down? I'm not sure 
they ever found out who did. Did you find a

09:18.307 --> 09:24.773
difference in race relations between Arkansas 
and Texas?

09:27.048 --> 09:28.029
Perhaps a little. There may have been a bit more 
prejudice at that time. Of course, when you move

09:34.737 --> 09:39.463
from Victoria, which is in South Texas, it's 
different. And when you come across East Texas and

09:40.224 --> 09:50.156
on into Arkansas, there probably was more 
prejudice in East Texas and in Arkansas than there

09:40.224 --> 09:50.156
was in South Texas, for instance. What would you 
say accounted for that? I think historical

09:53.920 --> 09:56.143
location. and the fact that in East Texas and 
Arkansas, there were a larger segment of black

09:56.410 --> 10:04.803
people than there had been in South Texas. But the 
attitude of the people in Texarkana at the time

10:06.205 --> 10:15.420
that I went there, I felt like, was a very good 
attitude, not a bad attitude. Do you think that it

10:15.440 --> 10:21.810
changed dramatically since, say, the early 60s in 
that area?

10:27.241 --> 10:30.066
the school issue up there and so on. And I'm sure 
that filtered down to all the other communities in

10:31.027 --> 10:35.615
Arkansas. But yes, I think there was a better 
attitude by then. Okay, the Civil Rights Act of

10:40.383 --> 10:45.591
1964 granted blacks equal access to all public 
facilities. Churches, private institutions,

10:46.232 --> 10:52.843
however, what effect did the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 have on the church? I doubt that it had very

10:54.916 --> 10:57.739
much effect on the church at all. In fact, I think 
there were already some churches that were

10:58.921 --> 11:11.816
responding and opening their doors to blacks, 
although there were many, many sad to say that had

10:58.921 --> 11:11.816
not done so and that quite frankly still do not do 
so. So there was a great deal of segregation at that

11:12.717 --> 11:15.961
time? In the churches? Yes. Yes. Yes, there was. 
How did the church in the Southern Baptist

11:21.325 --> 11:28.113
Convention justify the segregation? I don't 
think they justified it. I can't recall any

11:30.015 --> 11:37.223
denominational leadership justifying it, and I 
personally never did justify it. In fact, in the

11:38.144 --> 11:48.396
churches where I pastored, I preached and shared 
with the people and sought to lead them in the

11:38.144 --> 11:48.396
direction of realizing that In a Christian 
institution, there was no difference. God

11:51.572 --> 11:53.195
certainly saw no difference. And that we needed to 
begin to change our attitudes and realize that all

11:54.036 --> 12:02.007
people were welcome in God's house. Right. How 
did, was it just then by like a tradition or what was

12:03.008 --> 12:13.603
expected that the blacks went to the black church 
and whites went to the white church? Or was there

12:14.003 --> 12:18.990
some kind of movement forcing the whites into the 
white church and the blacks forcing the blacks

12:19.510 --> 12:21.232
away from the white church. No, I think it was 
traditionally what happened over the years after

12:21.272 --> 12:27.541
the end of slavery. Of course, in those days, black 
people were members of white churches. Slaves

12:33.469 --> 12:36.373
were members of the churches where their masters 
were. And after freedom, why, there came a gradual

12:37.714 --> 12:48.849
segregation that I guess whites helped and blacks 
also probably contributed to. It was And by the

12:50.105 --> 12:52.669
60s, it was sort of a traditional thing. There were 
black churches and white churches. A lot of the

12:54.732 --> 12:58.317
people had never stopped to think about it, 
really. That's just the way it was in the

12:58.797 --> 13:00.700
community. So were there a great deal of 
integrated churches then at that time also? Now,

13:06.648 --> 13:08.130
which time are you talking about? In the 60s. In the 
60s. Did that integration work? No, there were not

13:11.155 --> 13:16.382
a large number of integrated churches, not in the 
communities where are even later in Texarkana.

13:22.616 --> 13:29.886
But with the passing of time, I think there was a 
changing of attitude. I know that our people in, of

13:30.747 --> 13:37.416
course, in Victoria, we did have a black member and 
could have had others had they wanted to come. In

13:38.298 --> 13:40.941
Texarkana, it was a little bit different. But we 
did have blacks visit at the services from time to

13:41.042 --> 13:48.512
time, though we never did have any that joined the 
church in Texarkana. Do you think that the blacks

13:49.319 --> 13:53.723
felt welcome in the church? I know that you tried to 
make them feel welcome. I'm not sure that they did

13:57.106 --> 14:00.509
feel welcome. Some of them probably did. While 
there were others that probably felt like they

14:03.112 --> 14:06.815
wouldn't be welcome. And I'm sure during those 
days, still, there was an element within many of

14:07.636 --> 14:17.925
our white churches that didn't feel that they 
really wanted black people to come. At the other

14:18.682 --> 14:26.912
end, there were also some people that would have 
been very happy for them to come. It was part of the

14:26.932 --> 14:28.054
change. And of course, it didn't take place 
overnight. Still, it's not taking place, sadly

14:31.258 --> 14:33.380
enough. So you said that there's an element that 
really didn't want the blacks in the church. How

14:38.627 --> 14:41.771
did those individuals justify the segregation? I 
don't think they had any way to justify it except

14:47.504 --> 14:56.613
Through their own prejudice, of course, as you may 
be aware, there are some people who take certain

14:47.504 --> 14:56.613
portions of the Scripture and say, here's a 
justification for it. But I personally do not

14:57.114 --> 15:01.218
believe that there's any justification of 
Scripture for it. And I think most white

15:01.238 --> 15:05.643
Christians realize that there's not. What was 
their biblical and scriptural justification for

15:05.663 --> 15:08.866
that? They probably went back to the Old 
Testament, for instance, after the flood and the

15:13.289 --> 15:30.073
stories, the accounts of the sons of Noah, Ham, 
Shem, and Japheth, and their son who say that one of

15:13.289 --> 15:30.073
those was probably black or was the forerunner of 
the black race. I don't think there's any

15:30.654 --> 15:35.161
justification for that at all in scripture. So 
they say that either Ham, Shem, or Japheth was a

15:35.181 --> 15:39.928
black? Or was the forerunner of the black race. I 
don't know how in the world they would justify that

15:43.445 --> 15:48.492
one of the boys was black and the other one weren't. 
Right. Have you ever encountered

15:49.253 --> 16:10.482
a belief that Jesus was, you know, perhaps of 
darker color or of, you know, you always see him

15:49.253 --> 16:10.482
pictured with the long hair and the, you know, 
blonde and blue eyes, but have you ever

15:49.253 --> 16:10.482
encountered a belief that, you know, maybe Jesus 
was of darker skin?

16:15.068 --> 16:16.130
on blue eyes. Most of the pictures or concepts that 
I've had since I was a boy was that he had dark hair

16:16.250 --> 16:37.764
and dark eyes and probably an olive complexion, 
certainly not a real white complexion like you

16:16.250 --> 16:37.764
might expect people from northern parts of the 
world to have, but rather dark complected. But I

16:37.784 --> 16:42.612
never had thought of him, you know, until recent 
years as being black. And I'm not sure there's any

16:43.418 --> 16:53.489
justification for his being black any more than 
there was for him being real white, colored white,

16:43.418 --> 16:53.489
or with blue eyes and blonde hair. Right.

16:56.773 --> 17:00.757
In the 1960s, there were many demonstrations, 
riots, and violent attacks. Did you ever deal with

17:01.257 --> 17:04.621
any riots, demonstrations, or attacks? No, I was 
never in a community or a situation where that

17:05.903 --> 17:10.928
occurred when I was present. Were there any other 
churches in the area that had problems with race

17:11.785 --> 17:18.153
relations? Not that I'm aware of, no. OK. How were 
the churches funded at that time? Was it mainly

17:26.825 --> 17:28.126
through donations? The Southern Baptist Church 
is where I was pastor. Yes, free will offerings as

17:32.732 --> 17:37.979
they had been for years and still are. Right. What 
effect do you think the lower economic position of

17:39.055 --> 17:45.524
minorities had on their position in the church? I 
think it may have had some effect. Southern

17:50.511 --> 17:56.479
Baptists years ago were primarily a low economic 
people. That has changed through the years and now

17:57.361 --> 18:04.731
we have become more middle income and even in some 
cases higher income. And I think Southern

18:05.572 --> 18:07.695
Baptists have probably for several decades now, 
to their own detriment, neglected lower income

18:08.435 --> 18:19.931
people, not just black, but whites and others as 
well. But I do think that that has had some effect in

18:20.852 --> 18:34.631
the racial area also, because oftentimes racial 
minorities are in the lower economic end of the

18:20.852 --> 18:34.631
spectrum. I know when I was pastor in Victoria, 
that I made an effort to try to enlist some Hispanic

18:37.460 --> 18:46.990
families in our church, primarily by trying to 
enlist their children to begin with. I would

18:47.911 --> 19:06.910
oftentimes go and pick up the boys and girls and 
bring them to church for several Sundays, and then

18:47.911 --> 19:06.910
find one of our church families who would take my 
place and begin to go by and pick up the children and

18:47.911 --> 19:06.910
try to cultivate those families.

19:07.666 --> 19:22.705
As it is evident in just about all walks of life, not 
just in the religious area of life, human beings

19:07.666 --> 19:22.705
have a way of sort of dividing themselves 
according to socioeconomic groups. And that has

19:22.725 --> 19:24.106
happened in the church. And it's sad because I feel 
like the church ought to be open not only to all

19:25.188 --> 19:35.901
people of all races, but also all people of all 
economic stratus. How did the families of those

19:36.556 --> 19:45.007
children feel when a white pastor was taking their 
kids to church? Did you ever encounter any

19:45.487 --> 19:47.069
conflict? No, no. In fact, they were very 
appreciative. And occasionally, one of those

19:50.614 --> 19:53.357
parents would visit the church. We were never 
really very successful in reaching entire

19:53.437 --> 19:57.682
families. But some of those children remained in 
the church and grew up and finished high school and

19:58.123 --> 20:06.293
were young adults in the church and were still 
there. So how do you feel that that affected the

20:06.948 --> 20:10.292
integration of the church? I think it helped some. 
But by and large, there still has not been an across

20:12.635 --> 20:20.284
the board integration in most of our churches even 
today. And I think part of the fault of that lies on

20:22.026 --> 20:29.675
both sides, both minorities as well as the 
majority. When you said that you feel that today

20:29.695 --> 20:36.904
the church has neglected some of the lower 
socioeconomic positions, In what ways do you

20:37.492 --> 20:38.573
mean? Well, I think it's a fairly well established 
fact that most people join themselves together in

20:40.396 --> 20:50.770
social groups. And oftentimes, the basis of those 
social groups is economic income. And I feel that

21:01.572 --> 21:06.260
Baptists have moved up the ladder in income. And as 
they have, for the most part, moved up the ladder,

21:06.861 --> 21:18.439
they have sometimes forgotten where they have 
come from in earlier years if they were on the lower

21:06.861 --> 21:18.439
part of the economic ladder. And I think Baptists 
are beginning to realize that now, Southern

21:18.940 --> 21:28.255
Baptists are, and are beginning to try to do more to 
reach out into communities to lower income people

21:28.673 --> 21:35.843
and try to reach them for Christ, better than we 
were doing, say, a decade or two ago. What

21:36.785 --> 21:41.892
accounted for the rise in socioeconomic status? 
Oh, I think an increase in education, for one

21:41.912 --> 21:54.090
thing, would have contributed to it, plus the 
experience of one family desiring their children

21:41.912 --> 21:54.090
to to be better off than they were. You oftentimes 
hear about that. I don't want my kids to go through

21:57.812 --> 22:00.114
what I had to go through. And so there was an 
elevation in terms of livelihood, income,

22:00.815 --> 22:10.425
education. And these things all tended to 
elevate, I think, the people. Do you think that the

22:15.771 --> 22:21.377
socioeconomic position of the Southern Baptist 
has risen at a different rate than that of other

22:22.167 --> 22:24.469
denominations? No, not really so. I think the same 
things happened to Methodists, Presbyterians,

22:26.111 --> 22:29.874
and others as well. Okay. At the time when there 
were segregated churches, what were the

22:32.657 --> 22:41.725
differences between the services in minority 
churches as opposed to white churches? Well, not

22:43.047 --> 22:49.693
just what were the differences then, but there are 
still differences today. Hispanic people, black

22:50.197 --> 23:03.433
people, I'm sure the same thing is true of Asian 
people because while in Texarkana, our church

22:50.197 --> 23:03.433
sponsored two Vietnamese families and helped 
them to get settled down over here. Culture,

23:04.675 --> 23:16.609
tradition,

23:04.675 --> 23:16.609
both have an effect on the type of worship that 
people have, not only in this country but other

23:04.675 --> 23:16.609
countries as well. And I think it becomes evident 
when you travel to other countries and realize

23:16.927 --> 23:27.261
that even for Baptists in other countries, they 
are not exactly the same as they are here in the

23:16.927 --> 23:27.261
States. The same thing is true in the black culture 
here or in the Hispanic culture. There are things

23:35.432 --> 23:39.257
that have been handed down through their 
families. There are traditions. There are

23:41.881 --> 23:44.284
folkways. they enter into ours as well. And they 
make differences in the approach in the black

23:48.119 --> 23:54.167
churches. Their services, I would say, for those 
that I have visited in and I have preached in black

23:55.389 --> 24:05.322
churches on occasion, their worship is somewhat 
freer.

24:09.467 --> 24:12.651
I wish sometimes that our white people could,

24:15.955 --> 24:20.400
and in being vocal about their faith and in 
praising the Lord. I know I've served in missions

24:22.482 --> 24:26.867
in Africa overseas, too. And I see something of 
that in the black people in Africa that certainly

24:27.448 --> 24:35.056
has been brought over into the black people here. 
And there are a lot of good things in all of those

24:36.377 --> 24:45.928
cultures that each one of our different cultures 
could probably benefit from if we share it more

24:46.162 --> 24:52.128
often. Okay. When you did preach in the black 
churches, how were you receptive there? Oh, very

24:56.192 --> 24:57.934
well. I loved preaching in black congregations. 
They are usually more responsive than our white

25:01.017 --> 25:05.442
people are to preaching. And

25:06.683 --> 25:16.033
there is not such a sense of time in having to get 
through as there is in our white congregations

25:06.683 --> 25:16.033
also. Why do you think that is? What accounts for 
those differences? Well, I don't know. I think

25:22.261 --> 25:25.005
partly it's their background. Their lifestyle is 
a bit different. They're not rushed. I think our

25:30.614 --> 25:38.105
white people so oftentimes talk, goes back partly 
to the economic thing. You know, we're so busy.

25:40.268 --> 25:46.037
Sometimes we've been busy making money and 
building successful businesses and so on like

25:40.268 --> 25:46.037
that. that has not taken hold of the black 
community or maybe the Hispanic community. It

25:50.280 --> 25:52.503
probably will in succeeding generations. I 
expect there will be a repetition of what's

25:52.603 --> 26:01.738
happened to our own white people in this country in 
those areas too as time goes on. When was the first

26:04.202 --> 26:08.329
time that minorities assumed a leadership role 
within the church? I'm not sure the question that

26:10.587 --> 26:13.270
you're asking. I don't think that minorities have 
assumed a leadership position. You're talking

26:19.477 --> 26:22.221
about the denomination or a local church? Yes, in 
the church, in the Son of Baptist Church. Okay, the

26:24.764 --> 26:27.006
Son of Baptist Convention. Let's talk about the 
convention. Yes. Because that would be

26:30.130 --> 26:31.271
different. Well, there are both blacks and 
Hispanics who have assumed some leadership

26:31.291 --> 26:38.940
positions in Southern Baptist circles in recent 
years. For instance, in Texas Baptist circles,

26:43.208 --> 26:49.376
there is a black department in our Texas Baptist 
convention now. And there is a Hispanic Baptist

26:50.398 --> 26:56.206
convention in Texas has been for a number of years. 
And so leadership roles have been assumed for, oh,

26:57.227 --> 27:05.338
I'd say the last 10 to 20 years more so than in the 
past. Now the local church, I really can't speak to

27:07.118 --> 27:17.571
that because I've not been in a church where there 
were leaders in the local congregation from the

27:07.118 --> 27:17.571
minority groups. When you're talking about the 
Hispanic Baptist Convention and the Black

27:19.053 --> 27:24.599
Circle, is that all part of the Southern Baptist 
Convention? Does that fall under their

27:24.619 --> 27:26.822
jurisdiction? No, I was talking primarily about 
the Texas Baptist Convention, which is totally

27:26.862 --> 27:34.071
independent of the Southern Baptist Convention. 
Baptist government is a little bit different from

27:34.625 --> 27:42.276
other denominations.

27:44.579 --> 27:59.080
It really begins with the most power being exerted 
in the local congregation and the state and the

27:44.579 --> 27:59.080
Southern Baptist Convention actually

28:03.160 --> 28:04.925
all of the local congregations. Okay. How would 
you characterize race relations in other

28:08.435 --> 28:15.997
denominations as compared to the Southern 
Baptists?

28:16.017 --> 28:17.862
I really don't know that much about the of the other 
mainline denominations that they have proceeded

28:20.727 --> 28:29.757
a bit more rapidly than Southern Baptists have, to 
my chagrin. But I don't know actually on a local

28:31.339 --> 28:35.984
basis how much that is true. Which denominations 
do you think progress the fastest and the slowest?

28:43.413 --> 28:46.937
I think Southern Baptists have been altogether 
slower than they should have been. other

28:47.660 --> 28:51.805
denominations that perhaps have moved faster. 
Maybe the perhaps Christian church, maybe the

28:53.027 --> 29:01.278
Methodist and Presbyterians have moved faster 
than we have, though I'm not sure of that. Okay.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.908
When the integration did occur, how did the white 
members of the church respond to this acceptance

29:03.000 --> 29:08.908
of minorities in the church? Was there any 
instance when the churches became more

29:09.462 --> 29:15.032
integrated where white members, you know, quit 
the church? I'm sure there have been cases where

29:16.013 --> 29:22.685
integrations occur where probably white members 
pulled out of the church because they were opposed

29:16.013 --> 29:22.685
to it. I've not been pastor where that has 
happened, but I've heard of instances where it has

29:23.466 --> 29:30.058
happened. When you were in Victoria and the one 
black member, Was she already in the church when

29:32.328 --> 29:35.212
you arrived there? No, she joined after I was 
there. And there was no conflict in the church? No

29:39.598 --> 29:41.941
problem. Did the minority members participate in 
all aspects of the church life? Well, in that case,

29:46.748 --> 29:49.852
you're speaking about just one, of course. And no, 
she participated primarily just on Sunday

29:50.613 --> 29:58.504
morning and was active in the church choir. OK. As 
it became more integrated, did minorities in

30:02.213 --> 30:14.173
general, speaking in general about this church, 
did they assume a role in all aspects of the church

30:02.213 --> 30:14.173
life? Or were they limited in their scope to, say, 
just Sunday mornings? No. I think now, speaking

30:21.285 --> 30:28.457
from the standpoint of the convention and not a 
local church, that they have increasingly had

30:29.281 --> 30:39.893
some influence, and I think that will grow from now 
on, that there's going to be an increasing

30:29.281 --> 30:39.893
influence among minorities in the Southern 
Baptist Convention. Okay. I was told that some

30:42.817 --> 30:52.388
people believed during the 60s and really earlier 
than the 60s that minorities, in particular

30:42.817 --> 30:52.388
blacks, did not have souls. What was your 
experience as far as encountering this belief? I

30:56.332 --> 30:57.854
never encountered that. I doubt that very many 
people believed that. At what point during the

31:03.842 --> 31:13.956
Civil Rights Movement did the church change from 
being segregated to being integrated, or do you

31:03.842 --> 31:13.956
think there was not just one pivotal incident? No, 
I don't think there was a pivotal incident because

31:13.976 --> 31:24.651
the civil rights laws that came about really did 
not affect the church so much as it did public

31:25.272 --> 31:34.864
governmental agencies and so on like that, 
schools and

31:25.272 --> 31:34.864
stores, businesses, and so on like that. But I 
think it is happening gradually. I think it has

31:40.271 --> 31:44.517
still not happened in many, many of our churches. 
And hopefully, as the years go by, it will happen

31:45.778 --> 31:50.945
more often. You were talking about the dynamics of 
the government and the Southern Baptist

31:55.478 --> 31:56.739
Convention. So would you say that the change will 
have to occur more from a bottom-up standpoint or

31:57.340 --> 32:03.407
more from a top-down? I think it occurred more from 
a top-down, and I think it should have occurred

32:04.869 --> 32:10.615
more from a bottom-up, but it didn't. Can you 
explain on that a little more? I think the churches

32:14.219 --> 32:23.950
should have taken the lead in being more open to the 
minorities from a Christian perspective. from

32:24.824 --> 32:28.168
the perspective of, you know, that they were all 
God's children. And the color of skin didn't

32:28.908 --> 32:31.691
really make a difference to the Lord. It shouldn't 
make a difference in his churches. And I think that

32:35.155 --> 32:38.779
the churches should have, and I still think they 
should. It's a very difficult area, though. It

32:42.383 --> 32:45.526
still is today, a very difficult area. But I think 
people are realizing more and more their

32:45.546 --> 32:51.152
responsibility and are more and more open Did the 
church ever change its doctrine and move towards

32:52.735 --> 32:56.119
integration? I cannot recall Southern Baptist 
churches changing any doctrine, no. Do you

33:06.553 --> 33:15.585
remember any incidents at all that significantly 
affected the church and its move towards

33:06.553 --> 33:15.585
integration? As a denomination, I think the civil 
rights laws did affect it. it made it begin to think

33:22.368 --> 33:35.642
more and more about the fact that

33:22.368 --> 33:35.642
segregation enforced was really not right. Of 
course, you can't make people go where they don't

33:36.222 --> 33:44.871
want to go, whether they're white, black, 
Hispanic, Asiatic, or any others. But there was

33:44.951 --> 33:49.776
really not the freedom and the openness to go. that 
there should have been and that there still needs

33:50.262 --> 33:53.066
to be. Were the seminaries, like Southwestern and 
Fort Worth, was that an integrated seminary? Yes,

34:00.176 --> 34:01.838
yes. There were not many black students when I was 
there, but there were some. There were Hispanics

34:06.164 --> 34:07.806
that were there. And increasingly, of course, 
there have been students from other races that

34:08.828 --> 34:15.477
were there. In the seminary, of course, we studied 
race relations in ethics courses and so on. So were

34:26.485 --> 34:29.569
there any segregated seminaries at the time?

34:32.553 --> 34:33.815
I do not know. There may have been, but I doubt that 
any of our Southern Baptist seminaries were

34:33.855 --> 34:41.465
segregated at the time. I think they were open. 
Okay. How would you... characterize in general

34:45.646 --> 34:48.749
the race relations in the church today?

34:51.691 --> 34:53.813
I still think it's got a long ways to go. I still 
think there are people who

34:54.914 --> 35:00.799
have a great deal of prejudice. I see that being 
broken down more and more, and I think that's a good

35:01.920 --> 35:06.484
sign. Part of the problem is, and we discussed a 
little while ago, is that the type of services are

35:07.885 --> 35:14.691
different. And I think oftentimes Hispanic 
people prefer their own type service. Black

35:22.257 --> 35:24.460
people prefer their own type service. White 
people prefer theirs. But I think there's a

35:28.985 --> 35:39.817
richness in all of these backgrounds, 
traditions, if you would call them that, that all

35:28.985 --> 35:39.817
of them could benefit from some. For the most part, 
I think people want to go with their on so-called

35:46.160 --> 36:02.865
racial group, but I think all the churches ought to 
be open to those people who might not want to and who

35:46.160 --> 36:02.865
might want to participate or be active in any other 
racial group. Okay. What portion of Southern

36:03.846 --> 36:07.431
Baptist churches today would you say are 
integrated? Matt, I really don't have any idea. I

36:12.579 --> 36:13.360
don't know. I would say probably Less than half of 
them are still integrated, maybe more than that.

36:21.661 --> 36:29.069
But in the local area, I've served only in the 
states of Texas and Arkansas. And of course,

36:29.970 --> 36:36.016
Sotheby's Convention encompasses all of the 
states of the United States. And how prevalent

36:36.036 --> 36:46.508
integration is, I'm sure it's more so in the 
northeast in our churches and probably in the far

36:36.036 --> 36:46.508
west than it still is in the old south. But to what 
degree, I don't know. If half of our churches are

36:49.756 --> 36:53.119
integrated, I would be surprised. Hopefully, 
more than half of them would be open to integration

36:54.560 --> 37:01.187
if people of other races came. So what effect do you 
think geographic barriers have on that

37:02.989 --> 37:12.698
segregation, as opposed to just the mindsets of 
the people there? Oh, I think geography has

37:13.775 --> 37:17.178
something to do with mindsets, too. I think 
they're interrelated, of course. And in the

37:20.080 --> 37:35.774
South, segregation has been more difficult, 
although there are many instances up north of

37:20.080 --> 37:35.774
racial problems that are just as severe as they are 
in the South, too. I think there's a growing

37:36.675 --> 37:43.140
awareness in the South, which might be thought of 
as the stronghold of segregation there. There's

37:43.643 --> 37:49.511
still a lot of people, I'm sure, who are very 
bitterly prejudiced. But gradually, I do think it

37:50.112 --> 37:52.735
is changing. Well, that concludes all my 
questions. Is there anything else you'd like to

37:56.920 --> 38:02.988
add about anything? No, nothing that I know of, 
Matthew. I've enjoyed talking with you, and I hope

38:05.251 --> 38:07.815
it helps. Well, I appreciate your time, and thank 
you very much.
