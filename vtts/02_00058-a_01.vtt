00:02.866 --> 00:08.472
This is testing, testing on Tuesday, July the 3rd.

00:08.572 --> 00:09.493
Testing, testing.

00:11.155 --> 00:12.116
Testing, testing.

00:12.256 --> 00:17.042
This is Tom Darling, July the 3rd, 2001.

00:17.062 --> 00:30.797
It is July 3 and we're in room 207 of the Evans Library and I have the pleasure and honor again of chatting with Major General Thomas G. Darling.

00:31.537 --> 00:38.228
and today we're chatting about his experiences when he came back to Texas A&M as the Commandant of the Corps of Cadets.

00:39.310 --> 00:48.024
Describe your experience between graduation from A&M and coming back to be Commandant.

00:48.685 --> 00:50.628
That was a period of 33 years.

00:51.349 --> 00:56.177
I went into the Air Force in July after graduating in May 1954.

00:56.630 --> 01:01.175
Again, not expecting to stay for a career, but that's the way it turned out.

01:01.236 --> 01:25.084
But I spent 33 years and served in numerous places and went through flying school and flew in SAC for a number of years and later was in command and staff assignments, which included one tour as Commandant of the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia, which was a very delightful assignment.

01:25.942 --> 01:43.089
choice times in the military working with essentially it was a college president in military terms, but I had responsibility for the curriculum and budget and everything associated with the university or with that school.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.553
The only thing we didn't

01:46.276 --> 01:56.190
We were funded through the federal government and hosted by the Navy there, but I'll cut it short there unless you have further questions.

01:56.230 --> 02:06.063
On that, you had, I'll bet, as fine of students as any institution ever in terms of their ability and their zeal and their effort.

02:06.364 --> 02:07.846
That is absolutely correct.

02:08.286 --> 02:10.770
It was called a mid-career professional school.

02:12.112 --> 02:14.595
We had majors and lieutenant colonels or

02:15.723 --> 02:19.648
Commanders, Lieutenant Commanders from the Navy, all services.

02:20.248 --> 02:28.939
Some of the civilian institutions sent people like the CIA and others, sent a few students to have a real mixed group of people there.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.924
And our students, most of them had master's degrees.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.106
Some of them had PhDs already.

02:36.408 --> 02:42.996
A few of them only had bachelor's, but most of them had master's degree and they were considered generally in the top 10% of their service.

02:43.347 --> 02:49.273
rising stars in the military, and it's been my pleasure to watch a number of those progress since then.

02:49.593 --> 02:50.414
All right.

02:50.434 --> 02:51.615
Then after that, then where?

02:52.697 --> 03:07.672
From that, I went out to California to be the vice commander of 15th Air Force, which was essentially the western half of the United States, all the SAC forces there, including bombers, tankers, ICBMs, and all of those forces.

03:08.633 --> 03:11.616
And it was there in California in May of

03:12.423 --> 03:22.075
1985, I had received orders to return to Norfolk to be the deputy commander of the Atlantic Command, which is a big, one of the big area commands.

03:22.535 --> 03:39.055
All the Atlantic, the literal countries, was our area of responsibility, but I was the first Air Force officer to be the vice commander, the deputy commander of what was one of the large unified commands, which was primarily naval.

03:39.592 --> 03:45.477
But again, this idea of jointness was very prevalent and they wanted someone from another service there.

03:45.918 --> 03:49.080
So I ended up there my last year in the military.

03:49.541 --> 03:55.967
But it was just prior to my leaving California that I received this letter out of the blue from a fellow named John Coldus.

03:57.428 --> 04:05.575
This was in May of 85, I believe, and he told me that A&M was doing a search to find a new commandant.

04:05.615 --> 04:07.557
They wanted a general officer and

04:08.414 --> 04:16.102
preferably someone had been in the Corps of Cadets at A&M, a graduate, and wanted to know if I was interested.

04:17.083 --> 04:23.089
This was a letter that came out of the blue to me and that really started our negotiation.

04:23.209 --> 04:37.763
I wrote him back and told him that I was flattered to even be asked to consider this position but that I wouldn't be able to be a candidate because I had just received orders to go to Norfolk to this Atlantic Command job and

04:38.198 --> 04:47.410
I thought it was a good career step for me and I wouldn't even be eligible for retirement until I'd been in place for at least a year.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.213
That was the rule.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.699
Once they move you, they want to get one year out of you anyway.

04:54.560 --> 05:01.629
And I had a couple more years to, three more years in fact, to do before mandatory retirement from the military.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.331
So I was looking forward to this assignment.

05:03.352 --> 05:04.493
I thought it was a good

05:04.793 --> 05:07.216
good opportunity for me to be in this command.

05:07.276 --> 05:13.884
And I thanked him and he writes me back and says, well, we're going to take some time doing this.

05:14.305 --> 05:18.370
You know, it may be a year or more before we select someone.

05:18.390 --> 05:20.933
So we'd still like to consider you a candidate.

05:21.734 --> 05:23.737
And I said, fine, that'll be fine.

05:24.558 --> 05:28.483
And so I went on to Norfolk and assumed this position there.

05:28.563 --> 05:31.206
There was a four-star admiral was my boss there.

05:31.827 --> 05:36.754
Admiral Lee Baggett, he was a Naval Academy graduate, a very bright man.

05:37.555 --> 05:38.777
I enjoyed working for him.

05:38.857 --> 05:46.228
He kind of took me under his wing knowing that I was not all that versed in naval things.

05:46.248 --> 05:50.094
But we did have Air Force assets and Army assets within the command.

05:50.975 --> 05:54.501
So there was a need for someone from another service.

05:54.581 --> 05:58.847
But I had a busy one year there working under him.

05:59.536 --> 06:01.938
He would take off around the world.

06:01.978 --> 06:07.924
He was a NATO commander and he'd have to go to the NATO meetings in Europe and leave me in charge of this thing.

06:08.885 --> 06:14.471
I never will forget the one Sunday afternoon I'd gone out to the golf course.

06:14.491 --> 06:21.978
He was away and I was in charge and I had this big brick on my hip and decided to go out and play a little golf there.

06:23.279 --> 06:25.982
I was reachable through the radio when

06:26.688 --> 06:38.460
Lo and behold, a mid-afternoon I get this call about the USS Stark being hit, which was a ship that came, I believe, out of our command to furnish.

06:38.480 --> 06:48.211
So there I was dealing with this major national event and working rules of engagement in the succeeding days and weeks.

06:48.331 --> 06:51.514
And this was a major national issue and all of that.

06:52.220 --> 06:59.589
I remember one of the US, the Russian submarine sank one day again when he was away and I was in charge of that.

06:59.649 --> 07:08.920
That was in the Atlantic that that submarine sank and created a national incident and a lot of things that came out of that.

07:09.040 --> 07:13.485
But I also gave tours on ships when we'd have

07:14.410 --> 07:20.917
Dignitaries visiting, he'd frequently send me to kind of lead the tour of the ship.

07:20.977 --> 07:27.004
So I thought it was a little strange that an Air Force guy here is leading a ship on the USS Rickover.

07:27.624 --> 07:31.208
I was leading a tour that day on the Rickover that he died.

07:32.209 --> 07:33.250
I never will forget that.

07:33.851 --> 07:36.134
While we were there, they announced that he had passed away.

07:37.175 --> 07:40.198
But I heard a lot of Rickover stories over the years.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.582
A very interesting experience.

07:42.963 --> 08:10.557
One other thing there, in the springtime, early that year, the Admiral had to make a trip to the Pacific, and he had some commitments out there that he felt compelled to make, but about that time he gets a notice from Washington that he is asked to testify before the readiness committee of the Senate on the readiness and sustainability of the command.

08:11.718 --> 08:16.665
Well, to my surprise, Admiral Baggett told me, he says, I've got this other thing.

08:16.705 --> 08:20.671
You're going to have to go testify before this Senate committee.

08:21.853 --> 08:26.960
Well, I had not testified before a committee like that in any jobs that I'd had to that point.

08:27.982 --> 08:35.633
But for two weeks, I immersed myself for 24 hours a day almost getting ready for this Senate hearing.

08:36.558 --> 08:51.139
And the Admiral from Sister Command in the Pacific, the Pacific Command, two-star Admiral came, and he and I together sat there and testified in the Rayburn building, I guess it was that day, but quite an experience.

08:52.782 --> 09:00.733
Some of the big-name senators, Senator Levin, who's now still a big gun in the Senate, was one of them.

09:00.813 --> 09:05.400
He was kind to us that day, but anyway, that all went very well, but

09:05.920 --> 09:15.914
When you're dealing with something you're not the foremost authority in and you're going to have to testify before Congress, it causes you to do a lot of homework.

09:15.934 --> 09:17.897
Then you hear back from A&M.

09:18.698 --> 09:19.118
Okay.

09:22.423 --> 09:26.889
John Colas did write me back and say they'd like to count me as a candidate.

09:27.390 --> 09:29.773
And I agreed to that.

09:30.174 --> 09:33.058
And then during the fall of...

09:34.760 --> 09:37.192
86 it is, I'm talking 86.

09:37.694 --> 09:40.467
John flew up to Norfolk to visit me.

09:41.223 --> 09:45.067
We had dinner together and he discussed the job in great detail.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.349
Had you met him before that personally?

09:47.749 --> 09:49.251
I had met him previously.

09:49.411 --> 09:56.378
I had been a reviewing officer one weekend for a football game about 79 or something like that.

09:56.978 --> 09:58.059
I'd met him briefly.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.822
I couldn't say that I knew him personally or anything.

10:00.882 --> 10:03.405
I'd met him, but I did not know him really.

10:03.425 --> 10:05.267
What were your first impressions of him?

10:05.647 --> 10:08.850
Well, I thought he was a very...

10:09.961 --> 10:21.754
warm, friendly person, very control of himself, kind, thoughtful, considerate, compassionate.

10:22.995 --> 10:26.699
The more I visited with him, the more he seemed to fit all those things.

10:26.779 --> 10:37.791
But I judged him a little different to what I thought he might be, you know, not knowing him.

10:38.378 --> 10:42.684
Very, very gentle, very kind, very thoughtful, very knowing kind of person.

10:42.704 --> 10:45.928
Did he give you greater insight to the search and what was going on?

10:45.948 --> 10:47.390
Oh, he gave me some insight.

10:47.770 --> 10:57.263
He didn't reveal all the information to me, but he told me they had several candidates and they wanted to narrow them down, I think, to four and maybe bring them down to the campus.

10:57.323 --> 11:04.572
Later I found that's kind of the typical, or say three or four, and have them come down to the campus.

11:05.007 --> 11:11.315
He didn't tell me who the other folks were or anything, but we just had a good visit.

11:11.375 --> 11:19.646
He wanted to know my philosophy about things, how I viewed things, what was my leadership style and on and on.

11:19.686 --> 11:20.908
He delved into all of that.

11:21.008 --> 11:23.351
Sounds like good questions, appropriate questions.

11:24.372 --> 11:32.483
He did tell me, you know, some of the background about the job, a little bit why they were looking for a general officer.

11:32.902 --> 11:36.789
Because they'd never had a general officer before as commandant of the Corps of Cadets.

11:37.531 --> 11:49.493
And up until that time, or for several years, the Army colonel that headed Army ROTC had also been doubling as the commandant of cadets.

11:50.097 --> 12:00.772
And he explained to me we had the death here in 84 of the cadet on the night march, which generated great adverse publicity and heartache.

12:01.854 --> 12:07.201
And he explained to me that it was rather difficult to hold.

12:07.241 --> 12:12.088
He didn't say this in these words, but this is what came through to me.

12:12.608 --> 12:19.716
you know, he was not really accountable to the university administration in the purest, strictest sense.

12:20.497 --> 12:22.239
You know, he was here on loan from the Army.

12:23.241 --> 12:33.092
So I got the idea they wanted a person who would be responsible and accountable to the university, and I think that's probably a good decision.

12:33.152 --> 12:35.055
On hindsight, I think it's the way it ought to be.

12:35.615 --> 12:36.917
That's the way most schools have gone.

12:36.937 --> 12:38.298
They still have these core programs.

12:39.039 --> 12:42.143
But he explained to me some of the background and

12:42.680 --> 12:51.395
He mentioned to me they had a new hazing law that came into effect, would be in effect that fall, was creating some interest.

12:54.881 --> 12:57.706
But he didn't go into great detail about all that.

12:57.766 --> 13:04.418
When I came here, I'll jump ahead a little bit, it didn't take long to realize that I didn't have a

13:05.292 --> 13:09.395
a very deep appreciation for what all this job entailed.

13:09.436 --> 13:13.339
And there's no way a boss can explain everything about a job.

13:13.379 --> 13:14.900
He didn't try to deceive me.

13:14.980 --> 13:16.942
I think he tried to explain the best he could.

13:17.042 --> 13:22.126
But, you know, just an hour or so interviews, you cannot cover all those things.

13:22.867 --> 13:26.630
The job turned out to be a lot more complex than I ever expected.

13:27.271 --> 13:30.834
But anyway, John invited me to A&M.

13:31.174 --> 13:33.776
My wife and I flew down and spent a weekend.

13:33.856 --> 13:34.877
We went before

13:35.228 --> 13:42.878
a search committee, I guess it was, and we had to meet several different people, and I met a few people at the university while I was here.

13:43.799 --> 13:52.590
I went in to see Dr. Vandiver, and Jerry Gaston had just been named to that associate provost job, I believe it was.

13:53.110 --> 14:00.780
He was just moving into his office over in the Koch building, and they told me, John told me, you need to go over and

14:01.621 --> 14:02.942
meet Jerry Gaston.

14:03.083 --> 14:29.991
I didn't know anything about him but I remember going there and Jerry didn't give me a short shake I wouldn't say I mean for his time and all but clearly his interest was keyed by this new position and just moving in and things unsettled in his office and I was kind of a burden on him I'm afraid at that time but you know I didn't know Jerry or anything but

14:30.308 --> 14:36.298
I met a few people like that while I was here, and it was a very warm visit.

14:36.338 --> 14:45.053
We went to a football game, and we went to John's house after the game and learned how he does all these things on football weekends.

14:45.133 --> 14:45.835
Pretty amazing.

14:45.875 --> 14:56.012
Mary Dell would prepare all this food, and he'd have a house full of people there, very warm and friendly, and a lot of students there, and the interaction I thought was kind of special.

14:56.397 --> 15:14.879
I detected something special about this guy that it sort of surprised me in a way to the degree to which he went out of his way to try to host and welcome and the way he knew students' names and could recall all these things.

15:14.959 --> 15:18.883
Later I learned more about that, but that was my impression.

15:18.903 --> 15:21.827
But we had a very positive visit here over the weekend.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.750
Did the visit in

15:25.085 --> 15:26.808
courage your interest?

15:27.328 --> 15:27.709
It did.

15:27.729 --> 15:28.931
It did.

15:28.951 --> 15:45.597
But I still had some mixed feelings about this, knowing I still had at least two and a half more years or so to do in the military, and the opportunity perhaps for additional rank and all there in the position I was in.

15:45.757 --> 15:47.700
I was in a setup where I could have

15:48.524 --> 15:51.288
been promoted or gone to another job even.

15:52.349 --> 15:59.358
It was that kind of a position and a very prestigious position which I felt very fortunate to be in.

15:59.478 --> 16:04.245
So I had some mixed feelings about abandoning that.

16:05.026 --> 16:09.992
I had some reservation about telling the Admiral that I think I may retire and leave

16:10.715 --> 16:12.577
when I hadn't been there too long.

16:14.158 --> 16:15.780
So I still had those mixed feelings.

16:15.800 --> 16:20.144
You know, if the offer comes, it had not come at that point.

16:20.164 --> 16:22.486
But John came back up to Virginia.

16:22.526 --> 16:25.268
Seemed like it was January, February.

16:26.149 --> 16:27.591
Invested me again up there.

16:28.471 --> 16:31.474
We had dinner and all that again and kind of went over some of this.

16:31.574 --> 16:35.398
And he told me there was a hiring freeze on at A&M at that time.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.920
That was when the budget got real tight.

16:38.322 --> 16:40.626
Just certain positions could be filled.

16:40.727 --> 16:47.459
They thought my position was one that they could fill, but it wasn't certain at that time.

16:47.540 --> 16:52.028
So there was some uncertainty in all this because of the hiring freeze.

16:52.328 --> 16:55.954
that had been implemented across the state, I guess.

16:57.837 --> 17:13.982
But anyway, it was still encouraging to me, listening to him, and I was excited about that opportunity, and it wasn't but a few days after that that I received a letter or call or both, I think.

17:14.587 --> 17:16.149
saying, you've been selected.

17:16.209 --> 17:18.252
We'd like you to take this job.

17:18.993 --> 17:20.695
And they wanted you to begin about when?

17:22.097 --> 17:23.719
Well, they said it's summer.

17:23.819 --> 17:25.121
I said, you know, it'd be summer.

17:25.301 --> 17:26.162
It's early.

17:26.522 --> 17:27.183
Summer of 87.

17:27.644 --> 17:31.930
This was early 87 that we were talking, February in that time period.

17:32.550 --> 17:36.135
And I told him it would be summer at the earliest before I could come.

17:36.215 --> 17:37.517
And he said that would be fine.

17:38.618 --> 17:40.020
Earlier he told me that

17:40.827 --> 17:48.555
they were going to take the whole year to do this, that he had put Malin Sutherland in as acting commandant.

17:48.635 --> 17:54.542
Malin was a young fellow that worked for him for a while, and he'd been in other jobs like this.

17:54.602 --> 17:58.946
He'd done a number of things, and he felt Malin could handle it.

17:58.966 --> 18:08.016
He was a former cadet, but we're just going to let it ride this year and let Malin be the interim commandant or acting commandant.

18:08.603 --> 18:15.858
and explained all that, and I didn't really have any fee.

18:16.319 --> 18:22.010
He just informed me of that, and that's the way it worked out.

18:22.050 --> 18:25.938
Malin was the interim, and he told me I could come in summer.

18:25.958 --> 18:28.924
They'd like to have me there whenever I could.

18:29.528 --> 18:59.367
summer would be fine and I again thought briefly I was excited about that thinking this is the only chance that I'll have to go to A&M this job won't be there if I wait one two more years I'd never thought about ending up at A&M in fact I'd considered retiring in Virginia eventually we loved the state of Virginia had a lot of contacts I'd been stationed in Virginia three four different three different times

18:59.887 --> 19:05.675
and had a lot of good close friends, people I'd met through the Staff College in Norfolk and all.

19:05.695 --> 19:10.822
So we kind of thought we might stay there, but this was an opportunity I hadn't expected.

19:10.902 --> 19:11.603
I didn't seek.

19:13.045 --> 19:18.212
And it didn't take me too long to decide that I would accept the position.

19:19.074 --> 19:21.817
And I went in and talked to Admiral Baggett about it.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.922
And he said, Tom, I don't know how you can turn that down.

19:24.942 --> 19:26.223
That's too good an opportunity.

19:26.744 --> 19:28.847
So that was the way it all happened.

19:29.131 --> 19:43.151
I retired there on the first of July and we drove straight to Texas and I was here in College Station about middle of July and really began work officially I think it was before the end of July.

19:45.915 --> 19:54.227
When you arrived, describe how the campus seemed to you compared with what you recall it was when you left.

19:54.545 --> 19:55.266
Physically?

19:55.647 --> 20:16.238
Well, I had been back several times through the year, so it wasn't a total change for me in that my son had attended here in the late 70s, and we'd been down for a football game every few years, and I read the magazines and all, so I kept up with things pretty well.

20:16.939 --> 20:23.809
I'd been a muster speaker in a couple of places and all of that, so it wasn't a total shock to me, but...

20:24.143 --> 20:25.305
Yet it was too.

20:26.989 --> 20:28.332
Guy and Hall gone.

20:29.213 --> 20:30.937
Cebiza was much different.

20:32.079 --> 20:36.869
The dining halls, the process of changing.

20:37.711 --> 20:41.899
The rudder complex, you know, I don't remember anything close to that.

20:42.318 --> 20:49.265
MSC looked pretty much as I remembered it with some growth, but it looked pretty much the same.

20:49.325 --> 20:51.427
The drill field, all of that.

20:51.548 --> 20:53.950
The Bell Tower is a new thing over there.

20:56.813 --> 21:00.196
Kyle Field, much bigger than what I knew.

21:00.277 --> 21:06.243
And then a lot of buildings like Harrington and all of these buildings, all of that was new.

21:06.283 --> 21:10.367
Now, I didn't get over into the academic buildings

21:10.702 --> 21:15.289
to where the academic buildings are very often, but when I did, it was just amazing.

21:15.389 --> 21:21.077
I walk over here today, I'm still amazed at the clustering of buildings on the campus.

21:21.618 --> 21:26.004
And you and your wife, what did you find, where'd you find a place to live?

21:26.545 --> 21:35.258
Well, when we accepted a position down here, my wife flew on down about March to start to look for a house.

21:35.693 --> 21:40.279
and she went around, looked a lot of places, didn't find anything that seemed to fit.

21:40.319 --> 21:50.472
At that time, Southwood Forest was just coming in as the dominant housing area or the most prominent housing area just starting.

21:51.574 --> 21:59.104
Emerald Forest seemed to be the one that was most established and all, but she didn't find anything to her liking.

21:59.184 --> 22:00.766
My brother lives in Houston.

22:00.786 --> 22:01.026
He's

22:01.934 --> 22:15.297
Nagy was an engineer, he runs a millwork business in Houston, and she stayed with them the night before she flew home, my brother and his wife, and talking to them, my brother said, why don't you let me build you a house?

22:15.317 --> 22:20.466
I said, I'll build you a house up there, and I'll save you some money on this.

22:20.918 --> 22:23.802
So we took him up on that offer, and he was our builder.

22:24.964 --> 22:29.771
And he's commuted up here most every day of the week during the construction of the home.

22:29.911 --> 22:35.018
So when we got here in July, the house was within a month of being finished.

22:35.679 --> 22:40.666
It's out in Wood Creek, Wood Creek subdivision, which was pretty new and small at the time.

22:41.527 --> 22:47.596
So we had to kind of commute and stay in a motel for him.

22:47.736 --> 22:49.018
Was this your first?

22:49.943 --> 22:53.209
personally owned home you'd had in a long time?

22:53.269 --> 22:55.954
Or had you lived in quarters?

22:55.974 --> 22:58.699
I'd lived in quarters in the most recent years.

22:58.899 --> 23:08.256
When I was in Omaha, the last time I was there, I was a colonel when I was there, but I made brigadier general while I was there.

23:08.692 --> 23:20.709
And they had a row of old 1896 homes over there on General's Row, and they required all the general officers to live in those quarters because they were on base close and all that.

23:21.651 --> 23:24.675
And we had bought this house and only had it for a year.

23:24.735 --> 23:35.130
And I had to vacate the house and move on base into these generals, the quarters they had for generals there.

23:35.170 --> 23:35.290
Uh-oh.

23:36.451 --> 23:37.373
And that was okay.

23:37.393 --> 23:40.742
We managed to break even on the house, but we'd owned that home.

23:41.624 --> 23:45.374
Let's see, we owned homes in Virginia.

23:45.514 --> 23:53.515
When I first went to Virginia, I went to the Pentagon in 1970, let's see, it'd be 1974.

23:54.001 --> 23:57.085
And we bought a home out in Annandale, Virginia, a new home.

23:57.685 --> 23:59.488
And it was quite the thing in those days.

24:00.128 --> 24:03.052
People would buy homes, especially in Washington, a place like that.

24:03.132 --> 24:06.135
Two or three years later, they'd sell them for a significant profit.

24:06.936 --> 24:11.101
We kept a home three years there and made a good-sized profit.

24:11.782 --> 24:14.966
Those days are long gone, but that was common in those days.

24:15.847 --> 24:20.232
When you got here, describe the staff that you inherited.

24:20.272 --> 24:22.675
Who were the key people?

24:23.650 --> 24:29.916
The key people in the Office of the Commandant were Lieutenant Colonel Don Johnson.

24:29.996 --> 24:32.258
He was the Deputy Commandant.

24:33.580 --> 24:40.847
Lieutenant Colonel Buck Henderson, Don Buck Henderson, was some kind of an assistant commandant title he had.

24:40.867 --> 24:44.650
They were the staff that I had there.

24:45.892 --> 24:51.497
And we had a couple of secretaries, a very small staff.

24:52.405 --> 24:59.194
We did the year before, I believe, take over the housing part of the Corps.

24:59.835 --> 25:15.156
Used to they were under student services under the housing program over there, but just the year before they'd made this split out and gave the commandant responsibility for the Corps housing people.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.342
Of course, we had the band, too.

25:17.402 --> 25:21.027
We had a band director, Joe Haney was the band director.

25:21.608 --> 25:26.354
In fact, when I came down on a visit, I got to meet a lot of people.

25:26.454 --> 25:30.799
One they wanted me to meet was Joe Haney over at the Aggie Band.

25:30.880 --> 25:35.385
Well, I thought that was one of the more interesting meetings I had was with Joe Haney.

25:36.387 --> 25:42.915
And young Jay Brewer was an assistant down with the band, as I recall.

25:43.520 --> 25:47.777
I think he was a captain or a lieutenant, I don't remember.

25:48.721 --> 25:52.737
Now, and these key people, core staff,

25:53.864 --> 25:59.875
So how many of them were active duty personnel and how many were A&M employees?

25:59.955 --> 26:05.706
Well, as far as the staff that I had, these were all A&M people that I'm talking about.

26:05.786 --> 26:13.260
Now, in addition, we had the ROTC departments there, and those people are all assigned by the military services.

26:13.280 --> 26:13.881
About how many?

26:14.722 --> 26:19.509
Well, I'd say about 10 to 15 people for each service.

26:19.529 --> 26:28.441
So about 40 to 45 people collectively in all the services assigned here in the Office of the Commandant.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.324
I need to back up just a little bit.

26:30.945 --> 26:42.501
When John Colis explained this job to me, he told me that it would be a dual position, that they were combining two positions.

26:43.409 --> 26:54.460
One of them would be the head of the School of Military Sciences, plural, Military Sciences, the head of the School of Military Sciences, and the other one would be the Commandant.

26:55.381 --> 27:10.497
And he briefly explained to me that this head of the School of Military Sciences was a job that General Orman Simpson used to hold here at the university, and that that position is responsible for the ROTC

27:10.595 --> 27:36.079
delivery of instruction and those programs and i would report to the provost on that chain and the other chain is commandant i would report to him as vice president for student affairs but he emphasized that in all their meetings and discussions they'd agreed that they were going to combine those two positions general simpson had become a

27:36.295 --> 27:40.199
sort of a quasi-retired advisor and all there.

27:40.219 --> 27:43.882
He still kept off his sum, but he was not in this position.

27:44.563 --> 27:51.649
He was another interesting man I met when I came down for interview and turned out to be one of my closest advisors and mentors.

27:51.849 --> 27:52.650
What a splendid man.

27:52.670 --> 27:53.050
Good man.

27:54.472 --> 28:03.400
But maybe we want to come back to this a little later, but this dual hat thing I had was somewhat awkward and confusing and

28:04.021 --> 28:05.723
Never fully defined.

28:09.168 --> 28:09.588
Been there.

28:10.369 --> 28:17.759
As the 40 to 45 active duty personnel.

28:18.499 --> 28:22.985
That's enlisted people, secretaries and officers.

28:23.085 --> 28:27.010
Each service had about six or seven officers maybe.

28:27.150 --> 28:30.695
And the highest ranking officer in each was a colonel.

28:31.416 --> 28:33.859
And they reported to you

28:34.379 --> 28:36.862
although they were all active duty.

28:38.343 --> 28:47.393
They reported to me as a university, under the university organization.

28:47.973 --> 28:54.760
However, and this is a point of concern, not a point of concern, that's not the right word.

28:54.840 --> 29:01.247
It's a point that

29:01.987 --> 29:11.699
that creates some problems in that the Colonel still owes his primary allegiance to the headquarters that's assigned him here, or to his service.

29:12.179 --> 29:17.866
He's sent here by the Army, the Air Force, the Marine Corps to run a program and to commission officers.

29:19.988 --> 29:28.078
So commissioning officers is their mission here, not training a bunch of cadets over here in the Corps.

29:28.463 --> 29:31.628
and various other kind of things.

29:34.632 --> 29:45.409
But here at the university they did report to me in a loose sense and later I told some of the people when I had thought about all this time that

29:45.963 --> 29:57.120
If you don't write an efficiency report or an annual report on a person, you don't have anything to do with their pay and salary, you don't have a lot of control over these folks.

29:58.142 --> 30:00.926
It's only a professional relationship that you have.

30:00.946 --> 30:06.114
And these people were military professionals, and they respected that I was a two-star general.

30:06.875 --> 30:09.439
And usually...

30:09.790 --> 30:15.819
you know, they went along in a cooperative manner, but sometimes we would be at odds on things.

30:16.841 --> 30:26.395
And, you know, the only real control you have is this professional relationship, and there was one other thing.

30:27.897 --> 30:37.992
Each of the services had an agreement they'd signed with the A&M to have these programs here, and they were very old, not very up to date at all, but

30:38.562 --> 30:48.734
In there, it does say that the university can terminate these people really with very little notice for a reason.

30:49.495 --> 31:04.031
So I had the authority to terminate them if our disagreement was such, but I always said that that wouldn't happen except in real unusual circumstances.

31:04.412 --> 31:08.316
But again, the problem to me was that I didn't have any

31:08.988 --> 31:12.635
any input into their service rating.

31:13.216 --> 31:15.680
I didn't have anything to do with their pay and salary.

31:16.462 --> 31:18.886
And, you know, I had to kind of ask a lot of time.

31:19.147 --> 31:29.967
You don't give directions very firmly or these people will object to that, sometimes may object to it.
