00:01.263 --> 00:15.800
My name is from Michael and I was born on January

00:01.263 --> 00:15.800
22nd, 1932 in Scranton,

00:01.263 --> 00:15.800
Pennsylvania. I was the son of an immigrant 
family. My father and mother

00:18.583 --> 00:23.790
were born in Italy. My father came here when he was 
two years old. And his father was killed

00:28.499 --> 00:36.229
in a mine accident. Mining? Yeah, cave-in. My 
father was eight years old, and he was the oldest of

00:39.053 --> 00:44.039
five children. And he had to quit school. These 
were the days before welfare. the social and he uh

00:50.909 --> 01:18.925
he had to he was the oldest and he had to quit school 
and went to work as a breaker boy and what did the

00:50.909 --> 01:18.925
breaker boy do they pick coal you know they would 
help help miners put coal into those carts they

00:50.909 --> 01:18.925
would work they would feed the animals you know the 
mules that carry these cards just odd jobs, you

01:19.192 --> 01:28.608
know, that men would probably do today, that 
children

01:19.192 --> 01:28.608
do today. And so he never finished

01:28.628 --> 01:34.839
his education. He had a third grade education. He 
was a very intelligent man, very sensitive man,

01:36.823 --> 01:40.329
but never finished school. And I think his one goal 
in life was to make sure that His son, and I was his

01:44.555 --> 01:51.685
only son, went to college and didn't have to do what 
he did. Sort of the classic immigrant story. My

01:55.309 --> 02:01.478
grandfather and grandmother went to Germany, so I 
kind of know what you're talking about. They

02:01.518 --> 02:04.582
wanted to get their son educated, which they did. 
And then he, of course, wanted to make sure we were

02:05.964 --> 02:09.128
educated, which he did. I can remember ever since I 
was a

02:09.563 --> 02:23.446
little boy, five or six years old, my mother 
stressing the importance of how I had to become

02:09.563 --> 02:23.446
educated and go to college. So I was the first one in 
our family to go to college. Where did you go? Tell

02:30.037 --> 02:31.880
me, now you grew up in Scranton. I grew up in 
Scranton, Pennsylvania.

02:36.817 --> 02:38.540
went to college at Penn State. And did your father 
stay in the mines while you were growing up? Yes, he

02:41.405 --> 02:42.106
did. He became, when he was an adult, he got a better 
job in the mines than what he had as a breaker boy. He

02:50.260 --> 02:51.803
became a carpenter. And so he was the guy who 
repaired The machinery that they used in

02:56.358 --> 03:13.139
breakers, and I don't know if you know what a 
breaker is, but a breaker is the place where they

02:56.358 --> 03:13.139
refine the coal after they take it out of the 
ground. And they have, you know, they put it

03:13.159 --> 03:15.442
through treatment of various kinds of water, and 
what else they do. They clean up the coal, and they

03:15.462 --> 03:18.306
put it into certain sizes. So they had equipment 
that had to be maintained, and he was a carpenter in

03:18.326 --> 03:23.833
that breaker. And he would go into the mines when 
they would cave in and shore them up and that sort of

03:24.100 --> 03:30.027
thing. So they were kind of jack of all trades. They 
were not fine carpenters, but people who built

03:34.293 --> 03:40.420
heavy structures. And where did you go to school? 
At undergraduate school at Penn State. And did you

03:45.447 --> 03:50.334
have an assistantship, or work your way through, 
or your family put you through? I had a

03:50.354 --> 04:00.508
scholarship, and in those days, as you know, it was 
not expensive to go to college, at a state school

03:50.354 --> 04:00.508
particularly, but I had a scholarship. Yeah, I 
imagine Penn State and A&M are very popular. Yeah,

04:03.312 --> 04:07.759
they're sort of peer institutions, both land 
grant institutions. And I was a biology major, and

04:09.501 --> 04:12.265
in those days, My goal was to become a biology 
professor. How about that? Yeah, I wanted to get a

04:18.631 --> 04:20.454
PhD. That's interesting. I was an embryologist. I 
went to graduate school at Ohio State. And after

04:29.745 --> 04:37.594
getting my master's degree, before I got my 
master's degree, I got married. I got married

04:38.485 --> 04:40.167
while in graduate school. And you got your 
master's at Ohio State?

04:45.955 --> 04:46.055
Yeah. And while there, I met a woman in class that I 
married, and I began to question whether I really

04:46.075 --> 04:58.671
wanted to teach and do research. And then I think 
getting married sort of also said to me, I better

04:59.275 --> 05:08.425
get out and start earning a living instead of 
staying at school. So I think those two factors

05:08.445 --> 05:13.691
convinced me that I should probably start 
working. And while teaching a biology laboratory

05:13.711 --> 05:25.283
course, I used to talk to this one guy who was a 
salesman who used to try to get me to adopt. lab

05:25.786 --> 05:28.089
manuals that I was using in the course. And he got me 
interested in publishing. He told me what he did.

05:33.878 --> 05:36.782
And I always loved doing this. So as most people who 
go into this profession, they're never trained

05:36.802 --> 05:39.426
for it. But one of the things I have in common is a 
love of books. And everyone I'm sure you've talked

05:42.611 --> 05:46.637
to who's been in this business has said that. And I 
was the same way. And so I became a textbook

05:49.441 --> 05:54.829
salesman. With? the McMillan Company. It was my 
first job in publishing. Now where were you based?

06:02.789 --> 06:11.779
I was based in Michigan, and I worked in the state of 
Michigan, the state of Ohio, and a third of the

06:02.789 --> 06:11.779
state of Pennsylvania. So I traveled by place. 
Where did you live in Michigan? Outside of

06:16.484 --> 06:17.385
Detroit. And then I did that for about two and a half 
years, and I got promoted to an acquisition

06:24.241 --> 06:28.487
editorial in New York. So we moved from Michigan to

06:28.507 --> 06:38.842
New York City. I moved to New Jersey, but I moved to 
New York City, where I was an acquisitions editor.

06:48.496 --> 06:50.299
And you'd be interested to know that I was a biology 
acquisition for the college division. And one of

06:50.718 --> 06:54.983
my predecessors was James Mitchell. No kidding. I 
still remember to this day when I was going through

06:55.684 --> 06:59.088
the files. I didn't know James Mitchell at that 
time. And I started reading. He worked in biology.

07:06.858 --> 07:08.840
He did a lot of things. But one of the things he did 
was biology. And I remember reading letters that

07:10.983 --> 07:16.810
he had written to various people. And he had, when 
he was at Macmillan, he wrote, I think he started

07:17.363 --> 07:24.430
Tales of the South Pacific, his first book. But he 
got it published while he was at Macmillan. And

07:28.014 --> 07:31.137
that was a success that he made. And he became, that 
and his next book, which I can't remember what it

07:31.157 --> 07:38.885
was, might have been the one, I'm not sure. He did 
the, uh, three or four in the Asian. Yeah. Sayonara

07:42.148 --> 07:43.129
was one. Yeah. And I was a Michigan fan. Yeah, I have 
been, too. Although I've never read most of his

07:47.172 --> 07:51.476
books, I must confess, including Hawaii. Well, I 
read Tales of the South Pacific. I like Caravans.

07:54.699 --> 07:57.061
Do you remember the old one, Caravans? And I like 
the Polish one, Poland. The best book he wrote, in

08:00.104 --> 08:02.887
my opinion, was Centennial. Centennial, yeah. I 
thought it was a terrific book, mainly because I

08:03.968 --> 08:12.416
was interested in the biology and the 
anthropology and geology. He wrote a lot about it.

08:13.827 --> 08:29.489
Anyway, he then left, he left Macmillan, and there 
were a couple of free editors in between him and me,

08:13.827 --> 08:29.489
but I was impressed with him. I thought he was a good 
editor. He wrote very good letters. I remember he

08:32.514 --> 08:39.143
was very conscientious, very earnest,

08:32.514 --> 08:39.143
and so That's where I got my start. I started in the 
commercial publishing business. And I had

08:46.914 --> 08:48.977
various jobs in publishing. I went on from being an 
acquisition

08:50.459 --> 09:01.372
editor to being an editorial director. And at one 
point, I got into marketing because I wanted to

09:01.392 --> 09:04.716
learn the marketing side of the business. And my 
last job in commercial publishing was director of

09:04.736 --> 09:09.282
marketing. for Random House. How long did you stay 
with McMillan?

09:15.529 --> 09:15.950
I'm trying to think. Probably 11 years or so. Ten or 
11 years. And then to Random House, still in New

09:22.239 --> 09:23.862
York. Still in New York, yeah. And he was director 
of marketing for the school and the college

09:26.586 --> 09:36.661
divisions of Random House. And then from there, I 
went into scholarly publishing. My first job was

09:39.839 --> 09:42.522
in scholarly publishing. Why? Well, mainly 
because I felt at that time that was the beginning

09:43.403 --> 09:59.101
of the move in commercial publishing to become 
like the movie business, where people wanted to do

09:43.403 --> 09:59.101
blockbuster books. You had to do best-selling 
college textbooks every time out, and I was

09:59.802 --> 10:07.230
becoming concerned about that i wanted to do books 
that i believed in not just books that made a lot of

10:07.733 --> 10:34.230
money and so i had friends who had gone into 
scholarly publishing and i remember talking to

10:07.733 --> 10:34.230
them and decided that i would make a career change 
and go into scholarly publishing and i became

10:07.733 --> 10:34.230
director of teachers college press

10:36.742 --> 10:38.945
Was that a new one? No, that has been around for a 
long time. It's been an old, I'd say, when I was

10:43.792 --> 10:48.739
there it celebrated its 50th anniversary. Oh, is 
that right? Yeah, so it was started a long time ago.

10:53.606 --> 10:56.070
It was unlike most scholarly publishers. It was a 
professional publisher, not a scholarly

10:56.090 --> 10:58.513
publisher. When did you make that move? I went 
there in 1978.

11:09.497 --> 11:11.840
Was the transition marked? It wasn't. It wasn't. 
The only thing that was different was that you

11:16.106 --> 11:27.842
could do books that you believed in and that 
whether they made money or lost money was not a big

11:16.106 --> 11:27.842
issue, as long as The press could live within its 
budget. And that's one of the reasons I went, is

11:31.119 --> 11:47.239
because I wanted to be able to do books that were 
exciting to me, that made a contribution to me, and

11:31.119 --> 11:47.239
that were not necessarily money makers. I was not 
opposed to doing books that made money. But I

11:50.583 --> 11:54.808
wanted to do books that, more importantly, made a 
contribution to me. Now, are you still, do you

11:57.016 --> 12:08.209
think, tuned in more to the science-type book as a 
director, as an acquisitions editor, as a

11:57.016 --> 12:08.209
whatever? A finance book? No, no, into science. 
Oh, science. Biology, anything. You've left

12:15.478 --> 12:16.499
that. I am, but I'm also very much interested in 
history books and anthropology. No, I would say

12:23.227 --> 12:24.508
that I'm not... So you never felt yourself being 
tilted to the science mode in particular? No,

12:28.337 --> 12:33.026
except I had most of my experience as an editor was 
in that area. So I always felt more comfortable in

12:33.286 --> 12:45.770
science because, first of all, I majored in it, and 
secondly, I worked as an acquisitions editor. But

12:45.790 --> 12:47.914
when I became a marketing manager, I also had to 
deal with other books. And when I was a salesman, I

12:51.352 --> 12:55.978
was dealing with other books, not just science 
books. MacMillan was a general college

12:56.299 --> 13:00.845
publisher, so they published from art to zoology. 
And so I've always been exposed to other fields,

13:01.866 --> 13:13.682
and I never felt that I was inadequate in other 
fields or I didn't know what I was doing. What was

13:14.827 --> 13:20.853
the size, roughly, of the Teachers College Press 
in terms of product? Were they doing

13:21.614 --> 13:23.776
textbook-type things? They were doing probably 
three or four types of books. First of all, they

13:27.719 --> 13:30.102
were doing scholarly books. They were doing 
professional books, books for practicing

13:30.122 --> 13:35.066
teachers. They were doing even school books. We 
did reading books for elementary and secondary

13:37.249 --> 13:42.994
school students. And so it was a broad-based

13:43.447 --> 13:56.528
publisher in terms of the fields, not in terms of 
the academic field, but in terms of the type of

13:43.447 --> 13:56.528
books it published. It focused on education, but 
various types of books within education.

14:01.776 --> 14:06.543
Reference books, scholarly books, textbooks, 
school books. One of the few, probably, not the

14:09.468 --> 14:17.939
only one at the time, university presses that did 
books for the school, public schools. There are

14:17.960 --> 14:22.025
very few that do that. We did, for example, a 
reading series called The Call of Crabs,

14:22.045 --> 14:36.605
and they were supplementary reading books 
designed for primary school. Very successful.

14:39.252 --> 14:41.175
They did extraordinarily well. They competed 
very effectively with . I'm wondering why

14:44.901 --> 14:50.811
university professors can't paddle in those 
waters . Well, some do now. For example, Yale does a

14:52.734 --> 14:58.584
high school French program, but very few do it. I 
know that. It seems to me that's a legitimate

15:00.126 --> 15:01.328
thing. extension of the scholarly work. It could 
be viewed that way. It's a different business and

15:07.711 --> 15:14.780
it takes a lot of financial resources to play in 
that game. But there are some people that can do it.

15:18.645 --> 15:27.877
Yale's program is one of the better high school 
language

15:18.645 --> 15:27.877
programs. So you're with the Columbia University 
from 78 until? 1983,

15:34.478 --> 15:43.961
when I went to the University of Pennsylvania to 
become director of WordPress. And I went there

15:44.823 --> 15:49.253
because I was getting

15:50.245 --> 15:53.029
I'm a little bored with just doing education 
books. I wanted to do books in a wider variety of

15:53.049 --> 15:56.994
fields. I wasn't bored with my job. I enjoyed my 
job. Columbia was a great place to learn.

16:02.461 --> 16:12.555
Columbia, let me tell you, compared to a state 
university like A&M, is easier to work with. The

16:12.575 --> 16:15.038
bureaucracy is about 10% of what you see in a state 
university. It's much more entrepreneurial. You

16:19.063 --> 16:29.836
can operate a university press better in a private 
university than you can in a state university

16:19.063 --> 16:29.836
because of all the regulations and bullshit. And 
that has really increased massively, I think, in

16:29.856 --> 16:34.101
the last 20 or 30 years. Yeah, I know. provost, and 
associate provost, and assistants, and all these

16:36.500 --> 16:44.129
state regulations. So that part is

16:44.149 --> 16:50.517
quite different. But I was simply trying to say 
that I enjoyed working at Columbia. It was a very

16:55.343 --> 16:57.986
important part of my life. I learned the scholarly 
business at Columbia. And then I went to Penn, and I

17:02.331 --> 17:06.456
was at Penn between

17:06.790 --> 17:14.023
1983 to 1995, when I came here. So I was up there 
about 12 years. Now, OK. What was your first M

17:14.844 --> 17:22.217
fighter, M flinger involvement with the M press? 
Well, Mary Miller played a role in my coming here in

17:22.923 --> 17:34.380
the sense that I had no intentions of coming to A&M. 
I knew very little about A&M. Mary Miller sent me an

17:37.284 --> 17:46.277
email telling me what a great place this was. 
Saying that they had a wonderful facility,

17:46.337 --> 17:51.985
tremendous support from their their 
administration, and

17:53.163 --> 18:01.899
great financial support as well. And why 
shouldn't I think about applying for this job

18:03.001 --> 18:09.492
here? And so she got me interested, and I said, I 
don't know if I really want to go there. I'm very

18:15.188 --> 18:18.292
happy at Penn. Although I had a strong interest in 
the Southwest. And I was thinking of the days that

18:23.859 --> 18:30.787
when I retire, I probably will retire in the 
Southwest or the West, one of the two. And so I

18:31.889 --> 18:35.553
decided to apply. And it was mainly Mary Miller who 
got me interested. And where did she get you from? I

18:41.678 --> 18:43.380
don't know. I'll ask her. Well, I think she may, now 
that I think about it, she may have sent emails to

18:43.841 --> 18:48.628
various people. I don't know. But anyway, I was one 
of them. But you're on the list. I was one that got

18:51.292 --> 18:52.834
it. And after I started thinking about it, and so I 
sent in an application. That was when? Probably

19:02.027 --> 19:03.890
in, yeah, I do. It was the fall of 1994. Now, did you 
know what was happening at A&M at that particular

19:06.394 --> 19:09.698
time? Did you have any kind of know? No. No, I knew 
something about the list. I knew that it was

19:15.609 --> 19:18.074
basically a regional publisher. I remember 
someone asking me at the time, how do you view A&M?

19:23.263 --> 19:28.031
Do you see it as a national publisher, an 
international publisher, a regional publisher?

19:28.051 --> 19:30.455
Without hesitation, I said regional. Not through 
any great knowledge, because I didn't make it a...

19:36.927 --> 19:39.631
And most people probably still make that 
response. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the faculty,

19:41.353 --> 19:49.584
particularly, I remember when I came here from 
Arizona, this was a big concern. Jim Rosenheim was

19:49.664 --> 19:52.268
on the search committee. Pam Hill was on the search 
committee. Those guys were made very strong

19:53.950 --> 19:58.316
points in those meetings. They probably made it 
with each applicant. They made it with me. That

20:01.541 --> 20:06.327
press had to reach a focus in the meeting, too. to 
become a stronger publisher, with a stronger

20:06.307 --> 20:16.438
reputation, a scholarly

20:06.307 --> 20:16.438
publisher than just regional publishers. That's 
a British historian speaking. Yes. Jim was

20:18.300 --> 20:19.302
reflecting that. And a literature person or an 
English person was reflecting the same thing.

20:22.906 --> 20:24.648
Those guys have international albums. It's a 
different world. That's all right. A different

20:25.949 --> 20:26.550
world. And they are not Texas historians and don't 
want I didn't want this press just to publish Texas

20:32.412 --> 20:37.779
history books. So you come to A&M for an interview. 
Right. I applied. I got a letter from Fred Heath,

20:44.527 --> 20:52.897
and Fred Heath asked me to come down for an 
interview. At that point, I gave very serious

20:53.678 --> 20:59.365
thought to what I was doing. I didn't give it as much 
thought. I said, that sounds like an interesting

21:01.157 --> 21:03.180
place. I've never heard anyone rave so much as Mary 
really did about it. It might be worth taking a look

21:08.847 --> 21:10.228
at. But then when Fred contacted me, I gave very 
serious thought to it. And I said, well, I probably

21:17.838 --> 21:22.063
am not interested in going down there. But I've 
come this far, so I probably should go and find out

21:22.083 --> 21:27.310
for sure what it's like. And

21:28.741 --> 21:34.210
you had never been here. I had been here. You had 
been here. In 1962, I came to Texas A&M University,

21:36.975 --> 21:52.521
stayed in a motel, to see an author of ours, a guy 
that I had signed up to do an instructor biology

21:36.975 --> 21:52.521
with, by the name of Larry Dillman.

21:53.497 --> 21:54.679
He's now retired. Did you know? Yeah. He was a very 
interesting guy. And I stayed in a hotel in Bryan. I

22:05.093 --> 22:06.696
spent a week in here. It was in August of 1962. I'll 
never forget it. And so that was my one time at A&M.

22:15.388 --> 22:17.250
Now, I didn't spend much time here. I was here a day 
or two just to see Larry and work with him because he

22:17.270 --> 22:23.419
was having some problems with management. And we 
worked on a manuscript for two days, I remember.

22:26.599 --> 22:29.342
And then I got back on a plane and went back to New 
York. Yeah. But I had been to A&M before. Yeah, we

22:32.526 --> 22:36.772
were in the world in 62, and it wasn't in 92 or 94 or 
whatever. And they were in that same building that

22:36.792 --> 22:40.977
they're in right now, biology. You know, I go by 
that building. Is that right? Yeah. I haven't been

22:44.382 --> 22:46.685
inside it, but I see it from the outside. But I 
remember seeing Larry in that building. We worked

22:49.709 --> 22:51.651
all day in his office. And I also talked to a couple 
of other A&M biology professors when I was here,

22:51.884 --> 23:03.422
because I was always on the lookout for other 
manuscripts as well. But I've been here. OK. So you

23:06.547 --> 23:08.250
come to the interview. You're offered a job. 
You're accepted. And at that point, what is your

23:12.536 --> 23:18.185
perception of what you have done and of what this 
press is? It's a regional press. Why are you

23:20.183 --> 23:23.568
attracted to A&M? That's a very good question, 
because when I told my boss that I was leaving to go

23:23.608 --> 23:37.066
to A&M, he said, why would you want to go from 
Pennsylvania to A&M? Because he saw it clearly as

23:37.086 --> 23:46.639
going from a very, in his mind, a very prestigious 
university to one that was less prestigious. I

23:46.659 --> 23:48.942
think what convinced me, and I I marveled that I 
made the decision myself at times. What convinced

23:52.748 --> 24:00.035
me was the people that I met here, both on the 
faculty and in the press. I've never been so

24:00.436 --> 24:18.034
impressed with people that I felt were concerned, 
interested, positive, intelligent, motivated,

24:00.436 --> 24:18.034
and who were so enthusiastic about this place. 
both the university and the press. And what

24:21.143 --> 24:25.329
convinced me in the final analysis was the people. 
The people that I met in the administration and the

24:26.710 --> 24:44.854
people I met in the administration were the search 
committee people, Fred Heath, Danny Parker, who

24:26.710 --> 24:44.854
was on the search committee, Ham Hill, Jim 
Rosenheim, whom I was very impressed with. I

24:45.495 --> 24:47.177
remember Jim was one guy that It was very 
interesting, because I admired him, I respected

24:47.748 --> 24:56.178
him, I thought he was a wonderful person.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.225
Mary Miller, I thought she was a special person. 
Bill Perry, I thought Bill was terrific. So it was

25:05.430 --> 25:08.113
the people that convinced me. Did you have any 
contact with the President's transfer types? I

25:12.419 --> 25:14.304
did not have any contact with him. See, that was the 
first time, I think, a director came in without any

25:14.344 --> 25:19.619
contact. I was interviewed by Bill Perry, the 
search committee first, But then when the search

25:25.193 --> 25:35.006
committee, I think, thought that I was a serious 
candidate, I was interviewed by Bill Perry and

25:25.193 --> 25:35.006
Charles Lee, who was an acting provost. You know, 
the press reports into the provost's office. And

25:38.711 --> 25:42.636
so those two guys were the people that I 
interviewed. And I did not interview them. Which

25:46.000 --> 25:52.128
was not the case when I interviewed at Columbia and 
Penn. Both those jobs I reported to the provost.

25:55.535 --> 25:59.963
But the president interviewed me in both places. 
Sheldon Hackney interviewed me at Penn, and a guy

26:00.163 --> 26:11.484
named Larry Kremenz interviewed me at Teachers 
College and was president at Penn. And so that

26:11.844 --> 26:16.092
struck me as

26:17.894 --> 26:30.613
Not being strange, but I said, it sounds to me, 
because I knew that the press reported to the

26:17.894 --> 26:30.613
president one time, I felt that they were trying to 
keep it within the provost's office. And I

26:30.633 --> 26:33.257
remember talking to Charles Lee about it. And he 
said, he was saying, do you do you feel okay about

26:37.199 --> 26:41.645
reporting to the provost rather than to the 
president? And I told him, I said, well, I had

26:41.665 --> 26:50.678
always reported to the provost, but I felt that the 
best situation for any press is to report directly

26:41.665 --> 26:50.678
to the president. But it wasn't enough to deter me 
or anything like that. I felt the people that I had

26:54.543 --> 27:01.232
met were terrific people, and that was the basic 
reasoning. I would say that this press and its

27:01.803 --> 27:05.869
staff convinced me too. That's been a selling 
point all the way through the whole system. But

27:10.496 --> 27:18.528
that is interesting that the chancellor and our 
president were really directly involved in

27:10.496 --> 27:18.528
talking about that. They were not. But that didn't 
bother me because I felt that there was a lot of

27:19.710 --> 27:22.814
support. And I had taken a very hard look at the 
financial side of this press. This press was in

27:26.960 --> 27:29.925
very good shape financially. Yeah. One of the 
things that many people in scholarly publishing

27:30.676 --> 27:40.430
worry about, like colleagues at other university 
presses, is the lack of support that they have from

27:30.676 --> 27:40.430
the administration. This is a place that does not 
have that. Despite the fact it doesn't report to

27:42.393 --> 27:58.337
the president, it still has tremendous support, 
and mainly because of what Frank did early on and

27:42.393 --> 27:58.337
the fact that he reported to the president and got 
support right from the very beginning from the

27:42.393 --> 27:58.337
people at the top of the school district. And I 
think that's been a very crucial factor in the

27:58.874 --> 28:04.162
success of this class. If Frank reported to the 
director of libraries or Robert Smith, this place

28:04.182 --> 28:13.697
would not be the place that it is. He would have 
never had the financial support. No, and he knew

28:15.640 --> 28:16.282
that. He knew that instinctively, I'm sure. And in 
a way, I think that probably was a mechanism to

28:18.485 --> 28:26.738
avoid being too entangled with the faculty I'm not 
sure how you report it at Texas, but I do know the

28:27.393 --> 28:34.704
faculty really got his goat. And he may have seen 
this as an opportunity to achieve a level of

28:34.724 --> 28:42.035
independence and deal with the faculty at arm's 
length instead. Probably. Now I feel differently

28:43.477 --> 28:53.232
about, I don't know how Frank felt, and I wouldn't 
make any judgments about it, but my feeling is that

28:43.477 --> 28:53.232
a press director has to spend as much time wooing 
the faculty as he does the administration. I feel

28:57.484 --> 29:03.155
that the faculty is a very important support 
structure for a university press. It didn't need

29:03.676 --> 29:06.742
it here because of the support it had from the top. 
Yeah, and I don't think Frank felt that, quite

29:06.783 --> 29:10.269
frankly. The faculty were useful. I did. But they 
could be a deterrent. Yeah, I do not feel that way.

29:17.774 --> 29:21.242
And I think mainly because of where I've come from. 
At both Columbia and Penn, the faculty is more of a

29:21.663 --> 29:28.558
governing body than it is here. This university is 
governed from the top down. The faculty does not

29:31.705 --> 29:34.170
have nearly as much say. At Penn, the faculty had as 
much say about whether something survived as the

29:34.420 --> 29:40.307
president did. And so I have always been sensitive 
to that, because I knew that without the support of

29:40.327 --> 29:49.359
the faculty, the press would not have support. And 
I worked as hard on convincing the faculty that we

29:49.379 --> 29:57.669
were doing important things at Penn as I did 
convincing my boss. Now, do you think that the fact

29:58.430 --> 30:03.837
that the press was financially secure or had a 
greater degree of security provided a stronger

30:04.424 --> 30:12.814
incentive for more support from the 
administration. I don't get the fact that that

30:14.076 --> 30:19.283
would ever enter into their mind, really, the 
financial status of the press. No, they don't

30:19.303 --> 30:21.806
concern themselves with it. What they're 
concerned about is reputation. Is the press

30:24.249 --> 30:34.161
providing the kind of visibility to the 
university and to them as individuals to get

30:24.249 --> 30:34.161
published? And, you know, there are great parts of 
this university's faculty, they don't give one

30:34.327 --> 30:55.812
poot about the press because the science and 
engineering people, the press is not a factor, but

30:34.327 --> 30:55.812
the humanities people and the literature people, 
I mean, those people are very dependent upon

30:34.327 --> 30:55.812
university presses for tenure and promotion. 
Exactly. In fact, I'm kind of leaning into this

30:58.525 --> 31:09.861
chapter I'm working on now, is the idea that, in 
fact, the climate for university presses has

30:58.525 --> 31:09.861
increased tremendously because of the 
imperative to publish. The publisher parish

31:09.881 --> 31:18.153
commandment really promoted the expansion of 
university presses. And that's part of that.

31:19.495 --> 31:19.855
Good. So that fits. All right. Now, to answer that 
first part of your question, which had to do with Do

31:26.605 --> 31:35.938
you think that this press had the financial 
underpinnings that was necessary to continue its

31:26.605 --> 31:35.938
success? You raised the question something like 
that. Different words but that's what you meant.

31:41.266 --> 31:46.133
And I think one of the reasons I came here is because 
I felt this press
