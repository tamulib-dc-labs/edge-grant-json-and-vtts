WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:04.827
And...

00:05.313 --> 00:08.537
I came to A&M after World War II. I went down to North 
Carolina State where I got my BS degree after the

00:09.759 --> 00:14.305
war. And Dr. Lindsey had taught there before the 
war, and they suggested that I might write him to

00:15.126 --> 00:24.238
get into graduate school. So I wrote him in. Were 
you, excuse me, were you from North Carolina?

00:28.764 --> 00:30.427
Around Statesville, yes. See, I did, went to Mars 
Hill Junior College. I got an A.B. there, a

00:37.087 --> 00:43.034
Bachelor of Chemical Engineering from North 
Carolina State in 1943. And then I was in the Navy

00:44.135 --> 00:46.258
for four years. I worked for Burlington Mills for 
one year. Then I decided I really wanted to go back

00:50.022 --> 00:53.386
to graduate school. So then I went back down to 
North Carolina State and talked with the

00:53.406 --> 00:59.232
professors there. And I had missed Lindsey 
because he had taught there while I was in the

00:59.600 --> 01:04.867
service, I guess. I think just one year or so, one or 
two years. He wasn't teaching there when I

01:08.452 --> 01:10.996
finished in 43. And he wasn't there when I went back 
after the war. He'd come out here. And so they

01:15.702 --> 01:20.789
suggest I write him, and I wrote him, and he wanted 
me to come out here to go to graduate school. So I

01:21.090 --> 01:22.411
elected to come. And so I came out here then in 48, 
spring of 48. as to do the work on the master's

01:29.840 --> 01:36.366
degree. And then I got my master's here in 49 under 
Bill Murdock, P.G. Murdock, who had come and got

01:40.490 --> 01:50.800
hired sometime after the war. He'd been the shell 
developer at Emeryville. And so I did both my

01:56.045 --> 01:59.408
master's and my Ph.D. under him.

02:02.898 --> 02:08.606
Well, in the first area, I worked under on my 
master's degree. I did it on distillation,

02:09.026 --> 02:22.325
and it was a mathematical description of 
distillation columns using the finite

02:09.026 --> 02:22.325
difference calculus. And then for my Ph.D., I 
worked on chemical adsorption. I did a thesis on

02:28.533 --> 02:32.078
that, or a dissertation. And I actually finished 
it and got my degree in 1953. I started teaching for

02:36.975 --> 02:43.943
the department in 1952. That's one of my GI bills 
right now, so I needed some additional support.

02:49.209 --> 02:53.995
And so I began teaching then in 1952, and then 
finished up in 1953. And I started teaching in 1952

02:54.015 --> 02:59.041
as an instructor. And then in 1949, I made Let's 
see, I'm a full professor. In 1949, I got the

03:05.669 --> 03:09.056
master's degree. In 53, I got the PhD. And then, I 
guess it was about 59, I got the full professor. In

03:16.690 --> 03:21.319
64, I was named head of the department.

03:22.463 --> 03:23.524
You moved along fast. You moved along rapidly. 
Well, there wasn't many people back then. There

03:29.190 --> 03:38.961
wasn't much incentive to come to A&M to pay you a 
support back in those days.

03:39.341 --> 03:44.947
Do you remember, you were still under Lindsey. Do 
you remember much about Lindsey and the

03:44.967 --> 03:50.293
department when you first came into it? number of 
people here, and the general thrust or character

03:51.353 --> 03:56.600
of the department? Were they petroleum types, or 
were they- what were we doing mostly? Well, at that

04:00.125 --> 04:04.831
time, he was building a department, trying to 
build a department at that time. Very difficult

04:04.852 --> 04:09.718
for him because every time he got some, they'd go- 
Moved on. Moved on. Jobs were good. He had G.L.

04:13.503 --> 04:18.731
Fair, who'd been with Mobile during the war, and 
A.M. Platt, both been with Mobile. They were

04:19.331 --> 04:20.533
teaching. And Bob Andrews, who was in the service, 
was one of the professors, and so was F.F. Bishop.

04:29.442 --> 04:31.504
Yeah, I've heard a lot of people mention him. He was 
with the department then. And he was a full

04:34.448 --> 04:36.831
professor. And W.D. Harris was a full professor. 
Yeah. I interviewed John there. Oh, you did?

04:43.119 --> 04:43.519
Yesterday, yeah. He's been playing today. Yeah. 
And so... But actually though, let's see, about

04:51.057 --> 04:59.905
the time I got my Ph.D., Dr. Murdock quit and went 
with Dow. And G.L. Fair quit about that time and

05:04.368 --> 05:16.299
took a job as associate editor or assistant editor 
or something, oil and gas journal. And A.M. Platt

05:16.319 --> 05:20.322
went out to Hanford all about the same time. And 
then Bill Murdock, my director, quit about the

05:24.400 --> 05:29.309
time I got my degree and went to Dallas. And so, at 
that time, that pretty little well left us with Dr.

05:30.952 --> 05:41.432
Harris, Dr. Lindsay. Bishop died in 1955.

05:48.230 --> 06:00.767
So we were down to Dr. Harris, Dr. Bishop, no I meant 
Dr. Harris, Lindsay,

05:48.230 --> 06:00.767
and I guess that was it. Bill Harris, was he around? 
No, we pulled him in to help do some teaching. We

06:07.436 --> 06:10.401
also got graduate students to help do some 
teaching. We just didn't have the staff to do it.

06:13.610 --> 06:21.657
So, we were trying to do a graduate program and try 
to teach young grads, and it was just the salaries

06:13.610 --> 06:21.657
they were paying back there. Actually, the V.S. 
were doing as well, if not a little better. I

06:25.821 --> 06:33.148
remember one of the persons went to work, and I 
started teaching, got more than 90 of the Ph.D.

06:25.821 --> 06:33.148
V.S. Yeah, I've heard someone else mention that 
before. So, it was really hard to hire people back

06:35.830 --> 06:41.035
then. So, we rocked along. Was sort of the thrust of 
the department at that time keyed in for

06:44.084 --> 06:49.590
petrochemical? Well, it really wasn't much 
different.

06:54.655 --> 06:57.038
It was to some extent, but not all that much. We were 
one of the first ones to establish a portion in

06:57.058 --> 07:04.225
chemical engineering kinetics analysis. This 
was done, this was a good group of people, so they

07:05.106 --> 07:10.752
had some of that. emphasis there, but it wasn't all 
that much. How about with agriculture, with the

07:14.457 --> 07:18.947
cotton, was it cotton research laboratory? 
Cotton seed products, research laboratory, that

07:18.967 --> 07:28.369
was kind of under, the doctor's worked over there 
part of the time. But we were pretty well separated

07:28.754 --> 07:31.599
from that at one time. I think they decided they 
wanted to run it, the experiment station. So they

07:35.887 --> 07:38.833
took it from- Probably Benson. No, it was before 
that. So they kind of pulled it out from under

07:41.497 --> 07:45.445
Lindsey and them. But Dr. Harry still worked over 
there. Then I've forgotten a long time, somewhere

07:48.190 --> 07:52.197
in that time, Bill Bill Harris came to help teach, 
and Dr. Davis, he came also to assist in the

07:52.750 --> 08:01.918
teaching, and we later hired both of those. I think 
both of them were working on degrees, and so they

08:04.200 --> 08:08.965
taught some while they were working on their 
degrees.

08:11.607 --> 08:15.391
And that was during the 50s. And then in 64, Dr. 
Lindsay stepped down and said, Did Lindsey stay on

08:25.538 --> 08:27.780
and teach for a while? Two or three years. I let him 
stay as long as he wanted to. He was elected not to

08:30.863 --> 08:35.608
teach any longer. I don't think he taught but a 
couple of years. It wasn't very much. Well, you

08:42.114 --> 08:45.858
really stepped into the headship at a prime time, 
didn't you? Really, 64 should have been sort of the

08:45.878 --> 08:48.700
beginning of the boom. Well, actually what 
happened there, even at the beginning of what

08:49.361 --> 08:53.605
happened then, It was John Connolly that was the 
one that really did more for Texas Education than

08:54.074 --> 08:59.581
anybody we've met. He got some salaries, and we got 
30% increases there two or three years ago. I'm not

09:06.750 --> 09:13.539
sure we've ever been much better off relatively 
then than we ought to have since that time. And that

09:13.559 --> 09:17.985
was all due to John Connolly, so that was when it 
started moving. I came here in 69, and there was a

09:18.005 --> 09:19.727
big There's lots of new people about that time, 
from 64 through 69, really. Yeah, but there are not

09:23.715 --> 09:25.878
too many people my age here. Or none of them now. But 
I mean, all during my career, there weren't many.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.473
Most of those went to industry. Yeah, right. 
Engineering and alternatives were so

09:35.114 --> 09:41.003
attractive. But never that way in history, I don't 
think. We were grateful for anything. Well,

09:46.606 --> 09:54.215
that's good to know, though, that Connolly, you 
know, like... Oh, yeah, he was the one, and he made

09:46.606 --> 09:54.215
all the difference in the world in Texas 
education. Up until that time, they were all

09:54.235 --> 09:59.781
saying, well, the legislature won't give us this, 
the legislature won't give us that. But he got out

09:59.801 --> 10:08.631
and convinced people that they needed to put some 
money into education, and the legislature, and

09:59.801 --> 10:08.631
they did, and that's when it started really going. 
What about the, on the higher levels at A&M,

10:09.252 --> 10:14.900
Gilchrist, Harrington, and Rudder? Well, you 
see, when I came here, Dr. Bolton was executive

10:15.100 --> 10:28.639
vice president, and Gilchrist was president, and 
that made Gilchrist, I guess he was chancellor

10:15.100 --> 10:28.639
then. Yeah, for a short time. Yeah, and then Bolton 
was executive vice president. And then Tom

10:35.392 --> 10:41.320
Harrington was teaching over, when I first came 
here, he was teaching over at the base. That's

10:42.802 --> 10:46.086
right, he was in charge of that NX program for a 
while. He got a B.S. degree in Company Engineering

10:47.407 --> 10:52.534
back in 21. But then they made Tom president, and 
while he was president, I see Morgan came in.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.241
That's right, two years. They had quite a 
squabble. And eventually they let Morgan go. I

11:09.790 --> 11:15.278
believe they made Morgan president and Tom became 
the chancellor. Then they let Morgan go and then

11:15.759 --> 11:20.586
Tom came back and was president. He's president 
two times. And chancellor, yeah. Yeah, well, I

11:24.216 --> 11:26.699
think it just dropped to chancellor.

11:28.501 --> 11:40.433
Then I guess they must have established the, he got 
Rutter in, and they eventually made Tom

11:28.501 --> 11:40.433
chancellor, I guess, again. And then Rutter was 
president. And then finally, they kept taking

11:43.656 --> 11:50.083
Tom's duties away from him the first thing he knew. 
He had, Rudder took it all over and became

11:50.890 --> 11:55.075
president. That's right, he ended up in charge of 
that foreign affair. Oh yeah, they just sent him on

11:58.539 --> 12:01.663
a world tour. I remember that. That was the 
kiss-off. That was his reward for retiring. I

12:07.390 --> 12:13.718
don't know why Rudder in such a hurry only had a few 
months until Harrington retired anyway. But

12:14.659 --> 12:18.484
anyway, that's the way that turned out. Now all of 
that really probably had little or no impact.

12:22.331 --> 12:24.015
Well, it did. Actually, Rudder. That's what I'm 
getting at. Rudder did more for the university, I

12:26.259 --> 12:29.745
think, than any president we've ever had. There's 
been none of them, and he's been close to where he

12:29.765 --> 12:34.394
was. And I think that he was one of the better ones 
we've ever had. Although, I didn't think he could

12:42.157 --> 12:47.304
cut it when they put him in. Well, I know no one did, 
you know. When I was doing that centennial

12:49.066 --> 13:01.943
history, Rutter was president, and I talked to him 
in the interview, and everybody I talked to said,

12:49.066 --> 13:01.943
well, this is an unlike candidate to Virginia. 
And, in fact, I used that comment in the pictorial

13:02.083 --> 13:08.011
history or something, which I'm revising this 
year. Ms. Rutter is still mad about that comment.

13:11.367 --> 13:15.113
that he was not qualified for the job, you know, or 
something like that that I made. She called me not

13:15.153 --> 13:18.999
too long ago and told me about it. I'm just trying to 
make a point that he was an unlikely man who did a

13:19.239 --> 13:24.427
miraculous job as president. Well, you know, 
people kind of felt that way. He had his training in

13:27.512 --> 13:30.917
physical education. In the land office and 
sheriff at one year or something. Then he came in

13:35.804 --> 13:38.168
here and But he really did a tremendous job as 
President, and then I was, see I was an apartment

13:38.789 --> 13:51.664
head most of the time, but when Benson became Dean, 
Barlow left. I was here when Barlow was Dean.

13:54.247 --> 13:57.290
Barlow left and then Benson became Dean. And Dean, 
he was, Dr. Lindsey worked under Benson two or

13:58.391 --> 14:07.682
three years before I was made head. And then we 
didn't go out and search. Benson just called me

14:09.886 --> 14:15.102
over to his office one day and said... That's the 
way the world works. He said, would you take the

14:15.122 --> 14:19.115
head of the department? He said, you don't have to 
answer. Right now, you can think it over a day or

14:21.449 --> 14:23.793
two. And I thought about it a little while, and 
finally decided, well, I'm interested in the work

14:25.635 --> 14:45.827
we were doing, so I finally decided, well, I can 
probably get about as much done on what I want to do

14:25.635 --> 14:45.827
if I'm here as I could if we got somebody else in here 
and had me doing what he wanted me to do. So I decided

14:45.867 --> 14:47.389
to go ahead and take it. Then I just came very near 
asking to try to get Lindsey to take it one more

14:48.145 --> 14:54.111
year.

14:56.894 --> 14:58.436
Good idea.

15:00.137 --> 15:05.042
And he was, so I knew Rutter real well. When people 
would come in and get the department money, he

15:05.122 --> 15:10.308
would always go to his office. So I knew him real 
well. How'd you and Vincent get along? Oh, just

15:13.431 --> 15:16.414
fine. Well, Calhoun was dean for a little while, 
not long. But Lindsey was head of the department,

15:21.182 --> 15:29.813
and Calhoun didn't. Yeah, I would have talked to 
Dr. Calhoun, but he's still in town anyway. Do you

15:34.539 --> 15:42.469
feel like Benson, when he, one thing he did was 
separate, or rather integrate, the research,

15:34.539 --> 15:42.469
teaching, And that was about your time, wasn't it, 
when you were department head? That's a hard thing

15:47.792 --> 15:49.214
to do. And he made a good effort at it. Well, what do 
you think? Well, I think it was integrated

15:53.862 --> 15:57.728
certainly better. I worked under two different 
conditions. Barlow was dean, Mellon was head of

16:02.556 --> 16:06.623
the experiment station. And I had two bosses, and 
each one of them thought And about half time on each

16:09.803 --> 16:14.149
one, each one of them thought I was working for them 
full time. Yeah, that's what happened, I know. And

16:16.312 --> 16:18.636
so, and they didn't get along. Barlow and Mello 
didn't get along. They wrote letters to one

16:21.019 --> 16:23.502
another on the same floor. One of them had an office 
on one end of that old Aerospace building and the

16:23.623 --> 16:32.215
other one had an office on the other end. I know 
that. I reported the both of them. That's where it

16:36.260 --> 16:38.764
happened, right off. But basically though, that 
system is still, that's continued. No, no,

16:44.457 --> 16:47.201
they've changed it. Then when Benson became dean, 
they put it back, put both the Experiment Station

16:47.241 --> 16:58.055
and the academic part of it, College of 
Engineering, all under one person. And that way it

16:58.315 --> 17:00.578
can be integrated. Because he can say, well, Let's 
see, if your grant's out, I guess we'd just put you

17:02.791 --> 17:06.736
on teaching.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.681
Provide more flexibility. Then when he, Benson, 
retired, they went back to the other system and

17:10.701 --> 17:17.289
they put Page in there. He had the academic part, 
and Skip,

17:18.030 --> 17:30.705
I mean, no, Page had the academic

17:18.030 --> 17:30.705
part. I should know that. Yeah, Skip Porter. Yeah, 
Skip Porter was the tease. That went on for two or

17:39.472 --> 17:51.187
three years, and then they got, the next time they 
put it back together, and that's the way it is right

17:39.472 --> 17:51.187
now. I know there's always been problems. But it's 
better back together. You can still run it down in

17:56.590 --> 17:58.373
one office. Although, theoretically, the 
stations isn't on the same par as a state

17:58.393 --> 18:06.266
institution as a university. Yeah, I know it. But 
it's really better run through the academic,

18:07.307 --> 18:12.816
because you mix it up a little better. I think that 
was part of the rub with Porter. Porter apparently

18:15.621 --> 18:20.048
had connections straight to the legislature. 
Well, he had all the money. Old Bates didn't have

18:22.651 --> 18:27.396
any money. As department head, when you came in, 
how would

18:28.197 --> 18:41.852
you describe the department, and what did you 
assume would be your primary effort or direction

18:28.197 --> 18:41.852
or means? Well, first of all, we had these staff 
members just before I come in, we hired two, who

18:41.872 --> 18:50.322
were Dr. Durbin and Dr. Hupin.

18:56.632 --> 19:04.103
And in all of those years back there, the southern 
universities were always, were already behind

18:56.632 --> 19:04.103
with research. The northern universities were 
already into it. So we, I can see we had to do a lot of

19:07.348 --> 19:11.875
catch up. And so what I tried to do was hire young 
professors and bring them in as assistant

19:11.895 --> 19:16.883
professors. And most of those people that are on 
the staff now except the recent hires, I ended up

19:17.723 --> 19:26.996
hiring them all. Including Ray, you hired Ray. I 
hired Ray, I hired Darby, I hired Booker, I hired

19:28.659 --> 19:44.862
Ackerman,

19:28.659 --> 19:44.862
I hired Ackerman,

19:28.659 --> 19:44.862
Hanson, Did you call

19:47.153 --> 19:53.123
home? And

19:53.343 --> 19:58.291
we made the reservation. Okay, good. And just to 
close it, it may bother them

19:59.413 --> 20:05.803
out there.

20:09.513 --> 20:14.979
Is the thrust of the department changing in terms 
of academics between 64 and 87? Well, I'll tell you

20:15.019 --> 20:22.987
one of the things that I've tried to do all the time, 
two or three times I've tried to do. One, I've tried

20:23.007 --> 20:36.381
to keep, you can just go all inches on research, and 
I've tried to keep those people walking that path

20:23.007 --> 20:36.381
where you're trying to do a good job at both levels. 
And we have these undergraduate students that

20:36.884 --> 20:45.655
we've got a responsibility to do a good job with 
them, and also try to build the graduate school. So

20:45.675 --> 20:47.718
we had two responsibilities. Another thing, I've 
been through all those lean years. Another thing

20:51.042 --> 21:00.394
I've tried to do, and I think I was pretty 
successful at it, because most people were on

20:51.042 --> 21:00.394
12-month salaries. And I kept juggling around one 
way or another, where everybody got to pay 12

21:01.268 --> 21:09.183
months out of a year, and I pampered them. 
Outsiders would say, well, maybe I pampered them

21:09.203 --> 21:12.869
too much. But I tried to keep that going the whole 
time. So, and also I tried to, didn't try to do

21:20.422 --> 21:24.427
everything. Lindsey used to try to do everything 
himself. Yeah, I know. He even checked the student

21:27.632 --> 21:32.298
program of the students. He worked and did all 
these kind of things. Milton used to read every

21:35.883 --> 21:38.667
thesis and every report. Yeah, so what I did was try 
to divide that up to where I could continue to do

21:38.867 --> 21:44.775
some research. So all the time I was head of the 
department I also continued to teach. I taught one

21:48.902 --> 21:51.065
or two courses a day. And also I wrote over a hundred 
technical papers and six books. I've written one

21:56.895 --> 21:59.138
since I got through. And so I tried to stay What was 
your research primarily? I did an awful lot

22:03.259 --> 22:08.067
because I could not do much experimental research 
being in an office and see. I just hit the wave of

22:08.327 --> 22:11.372
computers. So what we were looking at was how do you 
solve these simple engineering problems on

22:11.392 --> 22:17.421
computers. So that was the type of problem we were 
looking at. How did Don Harris and Ruth home

22:22.589 --> 22:23.531
yesterday. He was showing me his new computer. 
He's really loaded with some good equipment.

22:30.883 --> 22:35.211
So this is basically what I'm trying to do. We need 
to build a graduate program. We also need to keep a

22:38.156 --> 22:41.261
good undergraduate program. I had to keep those 
people trying to do a good job teaching and

22:41.281 --> 22:46.791
research. And so that was kind of what we had to do 
there, I saw. And we did fairly well at it. Those

22:56.123 --> 23:04.032
people that have come in now, some of them didn't 
fan out as well as others in the search, but a lot of

22:56.123 --> 23:04.032
them have done real well. And I hired Olsby also. 
There's another one. I hired Hall. Hall and Olsby.

23:09.659 --> 23:13.323
You've looked up all of them. I would guess. 
chemical engineering was one of the most... Dan

23:15.577 --> 23:21.767
Benson tells me when I visit him that we were the 
best department. Well, I started saying that. You

23:23.489 --> 23:24.851
know, I really did. In the sense that, well, you 
know, I knew Troy Crawford really well. As far as

23:29.038 --> 23:33.805
mechanical and the old stable line departments, 
they were here and they were good. But in terms of

23:33.970 --> 23:41.901
expansion and being at the edge of... We tried to 
keep, I tried to keep something that was going in

23:33.970 --> 23:41.901
all these different fields. Of development. We 
tried to do it with young people. I didn't. I

23:48.170 --> 23:48.851
resisted. They were always wanting me to hire 
these experts to come in, and I resisted that. You

23:53.849 --> 23:54.650
know, that's a problem. Time and again. Time and 
again, because what happens is they come in and

23:55.432 --> 23:58.597
they get all the goodies. Yeah, that's right. And 
you see these, uh... This Bokker's came in wanting

24:01.542 --> 24:03.886
to go to work for me. And I talked with him a little 
bit, and I decided, hell, let's just, uh... He

24:09.475 --> 24:12.380
would just be overwhelming my students. I mean, my 
young faculty. They just can't... He would just

24:16.508 --> 24:20.015
try to overwhelm them to where they'd be nothing. 
The big department can tolerate it, but we can't.

24:24.730 --> 24:34.405
That's really a problem, and you see a lot of these 
guys being brought in, especially in the last,

24:24.730 --> 24:34.405
what, 10 or 15 years, distinguished whatever they 
are, and they come in and they don't do anything.

24:34.425 --> 24:36.869
Yeah, they want to buy everything. And I thought, 
what's the real measure of accomplishments is to

24:36.889 --> 24:44.741
hire a young man and then have him make a 
contribution. Make him have, then let him have

24:44.761 --> 24:48.747
contributions. And so if you can hire the young 
people, bring them in. And also, you've got a

24:52.626 --> 24:54.950
pretty good chance, because they're hungry. 
That's right. No question about it. And so bring

24:58.396 --> 25:03.545
the young people in and let them do it. Now, again, 
between 64 and 87, roughly right now, Was there a,

25:08.673 --> 25:10.596
how about your students? What kind of students are 
you getting and how would you describe them? Where

25:13.420 --> 25:15.242
are they going after they get out of here? Oh you 
know it, well they've always, generally the only

25:15.262 --> 25:33.248
year we didn't have jobs was because

25:15.262 --> 25:33.248
that's when we had the biggest glass thing 
somewhere along there. It was hard for me to say,

25:34.029 --> 25:37.093
you know, We've had good students. I'll tell you 
the best students that I think I've ever ran across

25:38.950 --> 25:49.087
were, don't know that they were the smartest, but 
it was the World War II veterans that came back

25:38.950 --> 25:49.087
here. And it wasn't because they were necessarily 
any smarter. All they wanted to know was just what

25:51.531 --> 25:53.915
is required. Or they'd go after it. And they'd do it 
really first class. And I think... there's an

26:01.846 --> 26:28.427
indication that students are not working as hard 
they're well prepared maybe they are i don't know

26:01.846 --> 26:28.427
um i know they're not as good as attending classes 
no they sure not i remain i see that yeah in my class

26:01.846 --> 26:28.427
and uh i just kind of feel like well if you it's your 
business you're paying the money if you don't come

26:01.846 --> 26:28.427
in here and get it i'm not going to force you to yeah 
But as far as being prepared, they're well

26:29.048 --> 26:34.556
prepared. In fact, this would be hard to see for us 
to some extent because we get better students out

26:34.576 --> 26:41.187
of high school. Yeah, that's true, too. If you get 
smart students, it's hard to screw them up.

26:46.014 --> 26:48.378
They're going to be good. In spite of all the 
teaching that you do, they're still going to be

26:48.438 --> 26:56.490
smart students in the end. They're about as sharp 
as they ever were. They're sharp as they ever were.

27:01.982 --> 27:06.769
And they have had more, probably better 
preparation. The thing is, I don't think they work

27:07.249 --> 27:12.877
as hard as they tend to. And I don't think they're as 
thorough, won't be as thorough as they used to be.

27:24.034 --> 27:24.975
But they're sharp. Don or Bill Harris, one of them, 
was talking about the change that they have seen in

27:25.563 --> 27:40.611
that there's less hands-on engineering involved 
in construction and this kind of thing. Do you see

27:40.631 --> 27:41.333
that? Or is that even a... I'm sure there is from the 
old days. Well, actually, what's happening is

27:46.036 --> 27:50.863
that nobody's got much hands on anymore in the 
plants. Even when you're out there, yeah. Yeah,

27:52.245 --> 27:56.831
because it's all done in a control room where it 
needs to go out there and be changed valves. Well,

27:56.851 --> 27:59.354
that's probably what they were talking about. But 
now you turn the valve, you push the buttons, and

27:59.454 --> 28:04.020
you let the computer up, and you don't understand 
what you're doing. I don't know if that was Donald

28:04.120 --> 28:06.083
or Bill or one of them. But they still have to go out 
there and look at what's out there. And I don't know

28:12.877 --> 28:23.755
if there's really that much difference, because 
see, they never could do too much, because the

28:12.877 --> 28:23.755
union people were the only ones that could turn 
down anything, unless you had a strike. And so, I

28:24.136 --> 28:28.763
don't know if there's that much. There's a lot of 
difference. The big difference in industry now is

28:31.912 --> 28:38.346
they're pulling off a lot of the technical work 
that used to be done. It's not being done inside the

28:38.406 --> 28:40.591
industry anymore. They're contracting. They're 
contracting all their design work. They don't

28:44.741 --> 28:47.106
even have design forces. They've slimmed down to 
where the people working for them just kind of

28:47.086 --> 28:52.673
manage projects. They don't actually do the 
detailed design. They've got a few people around,

28:55.796 --> 29:01.083
but engineering firms are picking that up. Do you 
see more of your STEM-E graduates going into that

29:01.103 --> 29:05.047
kind of work? I'm not really sure because I'm not 
following employment right now. Well, there's a

29:09.648 --> 29:12.912
lot more changing now. I imagine there's a lot more 
changing around. But I don't think all this

29:16.436 --> 29:20.741
downsizing has been good. What's happened is that 
you can get into a situation and just keep cutting

29:20.761 --> 29:29.731
down and keep cutting down. I saw an article in the 
Post the other day. One of the stock brokers had

29:33.476 --> 29:37.360
come out and said that initially they were vapor. 
companies and help rate if they downsized. He said

29:41.726 --> 29:43.909
that was no longer. They had decided that they'd 
done already too much of that, and then he told,

29:43.929 --> 30:01.405
this was editorial, and then the guy told the story 
about the Scotsman with the horse, and he found out

29:43.929 --> 30:01.405
that, decided, well, I'm just beating this horse, 
I'm just better speed with it, so he cut it. Then he

30:01.425 --> 30:04.208
said, well, he seems to be getting along with that 
all right. So he cut it again, and he kept cutting

30:04.593 --> 30:10.001
and he kept cutting. Finally, he wasn't feeding no 
horse anything. He died. So that's just the moral

30:12.545 --> 30:14.528
of it. You can overdo it. But this is payout. The 
industries do go for payout. Yeah, and they seem to

30:21.198 --> 30:24.302
be pushed heavily by the financial community. 
They're pushed by them, and also they're pushed by

30:24.342 --> 30:26.905
others. If others start doing it, they start doing 
it. I never did understand that until I was talking

30:29.608 --> 30:38.439
to a fellow one day, and he pointed out to me, the 
petroleum company, production people were

30:29.608 --> 30:38.439
particularly bad about that. One of them started 
drilling over here, all of them. All of them

30:40.922 --> 30:45.227
running over there trying to get a lease, you know, 
at the same time. And he said, well, just think of

30:45.247 --> 30:50.293
yourself as a plantation board of directors. He 
said, you know the competition's running out

30:51.185 --> 30:53.929
doing this. And you chose not to go in that 
direction. Then it turns out that what they did was

30:59.396 --> 31:03.441
real successful and what you did failed. What do 
you think your board's going to say? You dumbass.

31:06.926 --> 31:08.107
Watch those people over there. You mean you 
couldn't see where they were going? That's the

31:10.871 --> 31:13.294
same with mergers and... all this kind of thing. 
But I think it's readjusting, and they're going

31:14.667 --> 31:18.877
more toward a team effort. Trying to go toward a 
team effort now, maybe this thing, but I think

31:19.198 --> 31:28.742
there's a lot of tendency toward cutting back on 
friends' benefits. One of the things that I'm

31:28.762 --> 31:30.827
afraid of is The same way with the universities. 
Once you get management too much in control, they

31:33.150 --> 31:40.461
tend to start trying to in effect the amounts of 
this running over the people. The same thing with

31:40.481 --> 31:47.151
the universities now, getting this going to 
revoke tenure. See, I was with this, I helped get in

31:47.632 --> 31:51.718
this. Tenure system? Well, not the tenure system 
as much as that grading system for students. I

31:58.450 --> 32:06.973
remember very well old Samson worked it out, and I 
supported him on it because I felt like everybody

31:58.450 --> 32:06.973
was just swearing and declaring this will never be 
used for salaries. I had some of these old guys

32:10.478 --> 32:14.984
around here say, I'm against that. The 
administration will be using that for salaries.

32:18.308 --> 32:21.412
No, no, they said they wouldn't. You know, they'll 
keep their word. And you see what's happened.

32:26.178 --> 32:26.659
That's right. Yeah, well, it's come from that. 
Because if they'd have kept it like it was

32:31.505 --> 32:36.672
initially, it would have been all right, just for 
the profit of the city. Yeah. But there's too much

32:36.772 --> 32:41.536
resistance there to use it. So that's a weakness

32:41.556 --> 32:46.641
of it. When you retired in 1987, did you go 
consulting? No, I set up this institute. And I

32:55.208 --> 33:00.372
still teach one course, but I run this institute 
that's a non-profit charitable corporation. I'm

33:00.893 --> 33:01.854
president of it. It operates just like the 
Research Foundation. We are not part of the

33:03.916 --> 33:05.597
university. Do you have some literature or 
brochure? Let me carry some of that away with me.

33:09.663 --> 33:12.187
I'll give you a whole packet of it. And so that's 
what we're getting out now, another mailing. So

33:17.416 --> 33:25.448
what I've done is looked at chemicals, cancer, 
safety in the workplace, hazardous waste

33:17.416 --> 33:25.448
incineration, chlorine. Speaking of that, Don 
Harris again was talking about his son, his son

33:25.849 --> 33:31.638
named William Sawyer. Yeah, he studied. Well, I 
think that's a... I don't think so at all. I think

33:42.813 --> 33:47.103
that... Well, I don't think so. No, I think that 
they both had the same kind of cancer. I think

33:52.034 --> 33:56.761
that's an inheritance.

33:57.402 --> 34:01.969
I think that was an inheritance. But actually we 
found that the industry had about 9% fewer lower

34:01.989 --> 34:10.702
cancer rates than the general public. We had this 
study done outside the university with an

34:10.742 --> 34:14.447
epidemiologist. with the Texas School of Public 
Health. And it turned out that they were 9% less,

34:17.533 --> 34:23.645
most of them were less statistically 
significant. Any of those that were elevated,

34:23.665 --> 34:28.053
none of them were statistically significant. So, 
and these were the people that were exposed more

34:29.015 --> 34:33.143
heavier than Don's son. They were the ones that 
were exposed. Back there, starting in the 30s,

34:35.858 --> 34:47.412
40s, and 50s, when there was no limitation on 
anything, the smoke was just billowing out of

34:35.858 --> 34:47.412
those tanks. And everybody looked on that as a sign 
of production, so they were full steam ahead.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.380
Well, that's good. That's a good thing. And then we 
did one on chlorine after that. The Texas chemical

34:58.385 --> 35:02.710
industry out here in the future is one we've done 
now. And we're doing two right at this time. One of

35:06.400 --> 35:07.563
them is on hormesis. We've hired that one done, but 
it's a property of a chemical to be toxic to high

35:08.305 --> 35:16.446
doses and therapeutic to low. And you see all 
medicines... Like snake poison or something.

35:19.413 --> 35:21.798
Well, all medicines are... Yeah, they are. That's 
right. And so there's no reason to suspect other

35:23.120 --> 35:25.966
chemists don't have. So what I'm going to do is see 
how widespread this is. Good. Now you can do this

35:29.413 --> 35:30.655
stuff. And then I'm doing more. Who are you going 
to? May I ask? Most of the food and drug

35:33.321 --> 35:35.725
administration? Oh, you mean... Oh, it was made 
mostly for the companies. By the companies?

35:41.714 --> 35:41.854
Uh-huh. They got a membership fee. We got about 80 
to 70 or 80 members. And then I go out and speak to, I

35:47.461 --> 35:52.808
speak to Rotary Clubs and Lions Clubs. I've spoken 
about once or twice a week to all of them, to the

35:53.049 --> 35:59.477
Rotary Clubs down in the Houston area. Well, 
that's great. That's exciting. That's a good

36:01.036 --> 36:02.419
thing to be doing. So, right now, we're getting out 
two or three mailings. One of them is the

36:06.188 --> 36:12.282
proceedings last spring at the annual meeting, 
which was on this topic of Hermesius. We're

36:13.345 --> 36:15.289
getting out. a review of, I'll give you a copy. 
Yeah, if you will. I did a little review on

36:21.624 --> 36:37.259
background on it, just an introduction to it, and I 
spoke for about 22 o'clock that night the other day

36:21.624 --> 36:37.259
on that, just in the form of my sending it out to some 
select members of the Institute. Then I had the

36:38.040 --> 36:42.424
review here not long ago, this book, Our Stolen 
Future, It's a book that's come out that, well,

36:43.349 --> 36:50.700
they're, what, basically... Pollution 
environment? Yeah, well, see, they start out with

36:50.720 --> 36:56.989
heavy doses have done all this damage to them, 
wildlife and so on. Yeah. Therefore, jump all the

36:58.471 --> 37:04.460
way over to the low-dose exposures is harmful. 
Well, we don't really know what that is. But they

37:07.545 --> 37:11.270
presented this back, and it's the way it's written 
up. So you want to abolish this one? And so what I'm

37:13.724 --> 37:22.068
doing at this point, yeah, and so it's just that we 
ought to do more testing to find out exactly where

37:13.724 --> 37:22.068
we are. So that was it. I'll tell you what, we 
probably did well running over there. All right.

37:26.781 --> 37:27.463
Great.
