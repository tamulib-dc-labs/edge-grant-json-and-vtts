00:08.910 --> 00:31.650
The training of the OTCC in Chalcobesco in

00:08.910 --> 00:31.650
the rifle was giving orders to go up to this famous 
camp up in Illinois and participate in the

00:08.910 --> 00:31.650
National Rifle Field. I won,

00:31.630 --> 00:50.820
and the Bullets had the hardest cut, and the next 
day they were sending because we had agreed to let

00:31.630 --> 00:50.820
the British Commando Force be coming to train 
there. That was an outstanding disappointment. I

00:54.800 --> 00:55.821
think I can understand that. That was an 
outstanding disappointment. I never did like the

00:57.800 --> 01:03.390
British Commando Forces. I think they... Let's 
see.

01:11.168 --> 01:19.590
They

01:11.168 --> 01:19.590
performed outstandingly.

01:19.570 --> 01:21.590
Let's go back to final review. Your parents came? 
Yes. Any other special people? No. And

01:26.932 --> 01:48.390
then describe commencement.

01:48.370 --> 01:50.390
Was commencement held in Guyon? Guyon. Do you 
remember who the speaker was? Every

01:53.370 --> 01:57.240
name was called. Every hand shaken. Let's see. Was 
Reveille around then? We had the original

02:03.420 --> 02:05.590
Reveille. Describe the original Reveille.

02:21.460 --> 02:28.060
Did Reveille

02:21.460 --> 02:28.060
predate your arrival? Was Reveille on the campus 
when you arrived as a freshman?

02:38.440 --> 02:44.860
Who took care of Reveille

02:38.440 --> 02:44.860
then? He literally

02:44.840 --> 03:02.110
did? Yeah. J. Harold

03:03.293 --> 03:12.940
Dunn? Yeah.

03:16.838 --> 03:21.620
Was

03:16.838 --> 03:21.620
he a student? Let's see. Oh,

03:24.007 --> 03:31.930
how good. How good. Silver Taps,

03:33.114 --> 03:40.260
where was that held? Describe it.

03:50.151 --> 04:07.790
Did

03:50.151 --> 04:07.790
the ceremony

03:50.151 --> 04:07.790
change as far as you know through the years? Almost

04:07.770 --> 04:29.560
had Silver

04:07.770 --> 04:29.560
Taps for each individual. I don't remember what 
year it was. Most

04:35.220 --> 04:42.860
of the time you knew. All right. Student 
diversity. Were there any Hispanic students? Did

04:49.920 --> 04:53.940
you all identify them in any way different from the 
others? Did they have, they didn't,

04:53.920 --> 05:14.400
were there some Mexican Americans? Jewish, what 
about Jewish students? Did

05:16.380 --> 05:22.500
you all have a special reference title for them? 
Were

05:22.480 --> 05:29.780
there many international students? Where

05:29.760 --> 05:39.010
were they from primarily? All

05:38.990 --> 05:54.745
right. We've got two more questions then. As 
you're getting ready to leave with your degree,

05:56.830 --> 06:02.850
what kind of world did you think you were entering? 
What did you think was ahead of

06:04.132 --> 06:25.140
you? All right. After the Army, what did you think 
you were going to do? I

06:28.120 --> 06:33.170
hoped to get a job. Well, I had a job at that time. Oh.

06:50.596 --> 07:04.250
Did they give you any indication what your pay 
would be with Humble?

07:04.230 --> 07:09.680
Did they come to the campus to do

07:04.230 --> 07:09.680
anything? Now, what was your pay as a second 
lieutenant?

07:16.810 --> 07:22.590
And you had a three-year obligation or two? You had 
a contract? About how many remained in the Corps

07:24.850 --> 07:31.560
their junior and senior year? Did everybody?

07:37.494 --> 07:48.220
Didn't you all have a different

07:37.494 --> 07:48.220
attrition each year? Even

07:48.200 --> 07:55.720
if it didn't focus off on the junior? All right. 
Then the important question. What did it mean to

07:57.700 --> 08:03.060
you, your life, that you went to Texas A&M? It

08:03.040 --> 08:35.590
was

08:03.040 --> 08:35.590
a

08:03.040 --> 08:35.590
pretty

08:03.040 --> 08:35.590
realistic

08:03.040 --> 08:35.590
situation. Why did you develop this deep love and 
gratitude for A&M? A&M was

08:40.570 --> 09:01.500
a place where

08:40.570 --> 09:01.500
you could go and dress. I had an opportunity to 
develop one of the talents I had when I was a school

09:02.480 --> 09:08.520
teacher. And, you know, you get older and you 
recommend it to other people. And you see kids that

09:11.500 --> 09:15.580
have followed and made a good reaction. Somehow

09:15.560 --> 09:19.580
or another, even now, their kids go to A&M and seem 
to get a better direction in their life. And

09:23.560 --> 09:27.700
students I see going to seminary, and

09:27.680 --> 09:42.540
I'm not alone in sharing the fact that A&M has been a 
very important part of my life, and the fellowship

09:42.520 --> 09:58.860
and the willingness to help

09:42.520 --> 09:58.860
this very big fraternity. And there are a few 
people that are really taking to it today. Let's

10:05.690 --> 10:07.710
see, that's the important one. One I forgot. Do you 
know anything about, the TTs and any other

10:11.690 --> 10:16.710
supposed secret fraternities when you were 
there?

10:50.920 --> 10:55.940
What was the most prestigious appointment or a 
selection or election that an undergraduate

10:55.920 --> 10:57.940
could have? Did

10:57.920 --> 11:27.650
you by chance know Woody Varner? He's a class ahead 
of you. Derwood

11:29.630 --> 11:40.780
T. Varner from Cottonwood, Texas.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.780
Let's quit there.
