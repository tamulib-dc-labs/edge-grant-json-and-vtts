WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:06.693
Camp

00:01.786 --> 00:06.693
Williams in San Antonio. And the trainee of the 
OTCC that shot

00:06.713 --> 00:29.207
the best score in the rifle was given orders to go up 
to this

00:06.713 --> 00:29.207
famous camp up in Illinois. And they were 
participating in a national rifle deal. I won, and

00:33.612 --> 00:50.955
the Bullets had the hardest cut, and the next day 
they were rescinded because we had agreed to let

00:33.612 --> 00:50.955
the British Commando Force be coming training 
there. That was an outstanding disappointment.

00:55.641 --> 00:59.086
That was an outstanding disappointment. I never 
did like the British Commando Forces. Let's see.

01:14.890 --> 01:22.017
Let's

01:14.890 --> 01:22.017
go back to final review. Your parents came? Yes. 
Any other special people? My brother

01:26.842 --> 01:31.406
and sister-in-law and my sister-in-law. And that 
is a special people's organization. And then

01:32.894 --> 01:37.400
describe commencement.

01:37.420 --> 01:40.043
I was very simple. We did it ahead. I

01:41.224 --> 01:48.614
finally did it ahead. What's commencement held in 
Guyon? Do you remember who the speaker was? Every

01:53.340 --> 01:57.285
name was called. Every hand shaken. Let's see, was 
Reveille around then? We had the original

02:04.280 --> 02:05.522
Reveille. Describe the original Reveille. The 
original Reveille was a curled oak. It wasn't

02:11.449 --> 02:13.671
really a beautiful cottage. But just like so many 
other great personalities. Did Reveille predate

02:24.604 --> 02:26.967
your arrival? Was Reveille on the campus when you 
arrived as a freshman? I'm not sure whether he had

02:32.446 --> 02:38.131
been in the area or not, but it wouldn't have been 
more than three or four. Who took care of Reveille

02:38.151 --> 02:43.356
then? I think one of Porter and the infantry took 
care of it. But he won it all. He literally did?

02:48.761 --> 02:48.861
Yeah. People always throw the jumps at him for it. 
You see, at that time,

02:49.782 --> 03:00.472
they had a company

02:49.782 --> 03:00.472
called Hamburg Stanton. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It 
was done from up in the middle of it. J. Harold Dunn.

03:12.703 --> 03:18.298
Was he a student?

03:19.915 --> 03:28.465
Uh, let's see.

03:29.546 --> 03:32.330
Oh, how good, how good. Silver Taps. Where

03:35.514 --> 03:39.979
was that held? Describe it.

03:48.502 --> 03:57.776
And

03:48.502 --> 03:57.776
the buglers? Did

03:57.836 --> 04:07.351
it, did the ceremony change as far as you know 
through the years?

04:10.436 --> 04:15.043
Well, of course, our attendance was almost 
man-coded. Everybody was out. And

04:17.071 --> 04:41.442
then we almost have several caps for each 
individual. Most of the time you need them. All

04:43.092 --> 04:44.714
right, student diversity. Were there any 
Hispanic students? Did you all identify them in

04:50.381 --> 04:53.384
any way different from the others? Did they have, 
they didn't?

05:10.345 --> 05:12.407
Were there some Mexican Americans? Jewish, what 
about Jewish students?

05:19.220 --> 05:22.263
Did y'all have a special reference title for them?

05:27.508 --> 05:29.530
Were there many international students? Where

05:31.813 --> 05:40.521
were they from primarily? All

05:40.923 --> 05:56.460
right, we got two more questions in. As you're 
getting ready to leave with your degree, what kind

05:57.341 --> 06:03.367
of world did you think you were entering? What did 
you think was ahead of you?

06:13.238 --> 06:32.765
All

06:13.238 --> 06:32.765
right, after the Army, what did you think you were 
going to do?

06:32.785 --> 06:36.630
Well, I had a job at that time.

06:48.473 --> 07:00.909
Did

06:48.473 --> 07:00.909
they give you any indication what your pay would be 
with Humble?

07:04.553 --> 07:09.340
Did they come to the campus to do anything?

07:09.800 --> 07:15.207
Now what was your pay as a second lieutenant?

07:16.688 --> 07:20.613
And you had a three-year obligation or two? I don't 
remember. You had a contract? Yeah. About how many

07:25.179 --> 07:31.908
remained in the Corps their junior and senior 
year? Did everybody?

07:36.314 --> 07:39.979
Well, the people weren't . All the sophomores are 
continuing on. They've been attrition each year.

07:53.761 --> 07:58.005
All right, then the important question. What did 
it mean to you, your life, that you went to Texas

07:59.366 --> 08:03.350
A&M? It's probably the most important thing in my 
life. Why

08:12.207 --> 08:41.286
did you develop this deep love and gratitude for 
A&M? But

08:41.958 --> 08:55.259
it had a tremendous effect on me. I was a pretty 
basic kid. I mean, I'm probably, although I'm

08:55.800 --> 08:57.823
testing on this board, it's going to be still a 
little aggressive.

09:01.583 --> 09:24.809
A&M

09:01.583 --> 09:24.809
gave me an opportunity to develop whatever 
talents I had to other folks. And, you know, when

09:24.829 --> 09:25.911
you get older, you recommend that. And you see kids 
that are following in the same direction, you

09:25.931 --> 09:27.292
know. Somehow or another, even now, the kids who go 
to A&M seem to get a better direction in their life.

09:29.294 --> 09:30.696
And the students I see going to seminary, they do 
what they should do.

09:34.220 --> 09:55.178
I'm

09:34.220 --> 09:55.178
not alone in sharing the fact that Abraham was very 
important in the situation of my life. And then the

09:55.198 --> 09:56.380
fellowship and the willingness to help others. 
Let's

09:56.562 --> 10:09.618
see, that's the important one I forgot. Do you know 
anything about the TTs and any other supposed

10:10.519 --> 10:22.114
secret fraternities when you were there?

10:23.005 --> 10:46.127
Maybe

10:23.005 --> 10:46.127
three

10:23.005 --> 10:46.127
or four guys got together and said we could do 
something with it. Most of the elections are all

10:46.147 --> 10:47.128
hat card elections. Usually the opportunity is in 
the infantry, the Calvary, or the campus

10:47.148 --> 10:49.490
elections. Every now and then the Calvary will get 
together and I'll go for some mission. What was the

10:51.592 --> 11:15.591
most prestigious appointment or a selection or 
election that an undergraduate could have

10:51.592 --> 11:15.591
at A&M

10:51.592 --> 11:15.591
then?

11:23.975 --> 11:26.018
Did you, by chance, know Woody Varner? He's a class 
ahead of you.

11:33.989 --> 11:40.899
Derwood T. Varner from Cottonwood, Texas.

11:40.919 --> 11:41.680
Let's quit there.
