00:08.910 --> 00:31.650
The training of the OTCC in Chalcobesco in

00:08.910 --> 00:31.650
the rifle was giving orders to go up to this famous 
camp up in Illinois and participate in the

00:08.910 --> 00:31.650
National Rifle Field. I won,

00:31.630 --> 00:50.820
and the Bullets had the hardest cut, and the next 
day they were sending because we had agreed to let

00:31.630 --> 00:50.820
the British Commando Force be coming to train 
there. That was an outstanding disappointment. I

00:54.800 --> 00:55.821
think I can understand that. That was an 
outstanding disappointment. I never did like the

00:57.800 --> 01:03.390
British Commando Forces. I think they... Let's 
see.

01:11.168 --> 01:19.590
They

01:11.168 --> 01:19.590
performed outstandingly.

01:19.570 --> 01:21.590
Let's go back to final review. Your parents came? 
Yes. Any other special people? No. And

01:26.932 --> 01:48.390
then describe commencement.

01:48.370 --> 01:50.390
Was commencement held in Guyon? Guyon. Do you 
remember who the speaker was? Every

01:53.370 --> 01:57.240
name was called. Every hand shaken. Let's see. Was 
Reveille around then? We had the original

02:03.420 --> 02:05.590
Reveille. Describe the original Reveille.

02:21.460 --> 02:28.060
Did Reveille

02:21.460 --> 02:28.060
predate your arrival? Was Reveille on the campus 
when you arrived as a freshman?

02:38.440 --> 02:44.860
Who took care of Reveille

02:38.440 --> 02:44.860
then? He literally

02:44.840 --> 03:02.110
did? Yeah. J. Harold

03:03.293 --> 03:12.940
Dunn? Yeah.

03:16.838 --> 03:21.620
Was

03:16.838 --> 03:21.620
he a student? Let's see. Oh,

03:24.007 --> 03:31.930
how good. How good. Silver Taps,

03:33.114 --> 03:40.260
where was that held? Describe it.

03:50.151 --> 04:07.790
Did

03:50.151 --> 04:07.790
the ceremony

03:50.151 --> 04:07.790
change as far as you know through the years? Almost

04:07.770 --> 04:29.560
had Silver

04:07.770 --> 04:29.560
Taps for each individual. I don't remember what 
year it was. Most

04:35.220 --> 04:42.860
of the time you knew. All right. Student 
diversity. Were there any Hispanic students? Did

04:49.920 --> 04:53.940
you all identify them in any way different from the 
others? Did they have, they didn't,

04:53.920 --> 05:14.400
were there some Mexican Americans? Jewish, what 
about Jewish students? Did

05:16.380 --> 05:22.500
you all have a special reference title for them? 
Were

05:22.480 --> 05:29.780
there many international students? Where

05:29.760 --> 05:39.010
were they from primarily? All

05:38.990 --> 05:54.745
right. We've got two more questions then. As 
you're getting ready to leave with your degree,

05:56.830 --> 06:02.850
what kind of world did you think you were entering? 
What did you think was ahead of

06:04.132 --> 06:25.140
you? All right. After the Army, what did you think 
you were going to do? I

06:28.120 --> 06:33.170
hoped to get a job. Well, I had a job at that time. Oh.

06:50.596 --> 07:04.250
Did they give you any indication what your pay 
would be with Humble?

07:04.230 --> 07:09.680
Did they come to the campus to do

07:04.230 --> 07:09.680
anything? Now, what was your pay as a second 
lieutenant?

07:16.810 --> 07:22.590
And you had a three-year obligation or two? You had 
a contract? About how many remained in the Corps

07:24.850 --> 07:31.560
their junior and senior year? Did everybody?

07:36.273 --> 07:46.220
We didn't want to.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.220
They'd be in attrition each year then. Even if you 
didn't focus up on junior. All

07:50.520 --> 07:55.136
right. Then the important question. It's a pretty 
realistic situation. Why did you develop this

07:57.700 --> 07:59.061
deep love and gratitude for A&M? A&M's for us. A&M 
gave me an opportunity to do. What did you do? I was a

08:02.040 --> 08:03.061
junior. I

08:03.040 --> 08:31.640
was

08:03.040 --> 08:31.640
a

08:03.040 --> 08:31.640
senior.

08:31.620 --> 08:32.641
I was a senior. I was a senior. I was a senior. I was a 
senior. I was a senior. I was a senior. I was a

08:38.570 --> 08:39.591
senior. I was a senior. I was

08:40.570 --> 08:53.810
a

08:40.570 --> 08:53.810
senior. I was a senior. I was a senior. I was

08:57.190 --> 09:01.500
a senior. I was a senior. But A&M gave

09:02.480 --> 09:13.680
me an opportunity to develop whatever talents I 
had, probably the fullest. You've already ...

09:13.660 --> 09:14.861
recommend them. But you see kids that are 
following, they're making a good раст. Somehow or

09:19.840 --> 09:24.020
another, even now, their intkes to go to A&M seem to 
get a better direction in their lives, and have ...

09:24.000 --> 09:27.660
students like Cllastittenutson ... and maybe ... 
oh, no. We'll let you do the math. We'll

09:30.220 --> 09:34.040
let you do it in all. Oh, man.

09:45.048 --> 10:09.607
Let's

09:45.048 --> 10:09.607
see, that's the important one I forgot. Do you know 
anything about the TTs and any other supposed

10:13.570 --> 10:35.440
secret fraternities when you were there?

10:50.720 --> 10:56.960
What was the most prestigious appointment or a 
selection or election that an undergraduate

10:56.940 --> 11:03.370
could have?

11:03.510 --> 11:26.025
Did

11:03.510 --> 11:26.025
you by chance know Woody Varner? He's a class ahead 
of you. Derwood

11:29.510 --> 11:40.895
T. Varner from Cottonwood, Texas.

11:40.915 --> 11:43.460
Let's quit this.
