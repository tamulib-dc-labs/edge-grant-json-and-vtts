WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:07.640
Camp Wallace in San Antonio.

00:07.660 --> 00:29.428
And the trainee of the OGCC that shot the best score in the rifle was getting orders to go up to this famous camp up in Illinois, I think.

00:30.209 --> 00:31.270
They were participating in the National Rifle Bill.

00:32.144 --> 00:37.912
And I won at the bullets and had my orders cut.

00:37.932 --> 00:50.949
And the next day they were rescinded because we had agreed to let the British Commando Force become trained there.

00:50.969 --> 00:55.175
That was an outstanding disappointment.

00:55.195 --> 00:56.336
I think I can understand.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.080
That was an outstanding disappointment.

00:59.313 --> 01:21.642
Let's go back to final review.

01:22.023 --> 01:22.924
Your parents came.

01:23.815 --> 01:25.837
Any other special people?

01:26.898 --> 01:37.747
And then describe commencement.

01:39.168 --> 01:50.738
Was commencement held at Guyon?

01:51.718 --> 01:53.620
Do you remember who the speaker was?

01:56.013 --> 01:57.235
Every name was called.

01:58.957 --> 01:59.919
Every hand shaken.

02:01.541 --> 02:03.184
Let's see, was Reveille around then?

02:04.245 --> 02:05.507
We had the original Reveille.

02:05.527 --> 02:09.213
Describe the original Reveille.

02:09.453 --> 02:12.558
The original Reveille was a curveball.

02:12.578 --> 02:13.659
Wasn't really a beautiful college.

02:15.101 --> 02:21.891
But just like somebody on great personality.

02:22.032 --> 02:24.315
He was all over the campus all the time.

02:24.481 --> 02:26.904
Did Reveley pre-date your arrival?

02:28.386 --> 02:31.010
Was Reveley on the campus when you arrived as a freshman?

02:32.592 --> 02:38.139
I'm not sure whether he had been that year or not, but it wouldn't have been more than three years before.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.462
Who took care of Reveley then?

02:40.602 --> 02:43.907
I think one of the more when the infantry took care of him.

02:43.927 --> 02:44.307
But he won it all.

02:44.407 --> 02:45.609
He literally did?

02:45.869 --> 02:48.913
Yeah.

02:48.933 --> 02:49.834
People always told me to jump to the emperor.

02:49.854 --> 02:51.096
See, at that time...

02:54.772 --> 03:10.752
J. Harold Dunn.

03:12.675 --> 03:18.602
Was he a student?

03:19.882 --> 03:28.173
Uh, let's see.

03:30.817 --> 03:33.080
Oh, how good, how good.

03:33.100 --> 03:33.921
Silver Taps.

03:35.484 --> 03:39.950
Where was that held?

03:42.273 --> 03:46.699
Describe it.

03:48.468 --> 03:57.740
And the buglers?

03:57.820 --> 04:07.332
Did the ceremony change as far as you know through the years?

04:10.416 --> 04:15.303
Well, of course, I attended some of those men code.

04:15.323 --> 04:15.623
Everybody died.

04:17.003 --> 04:41.442
And then we almost had several caps for each individual.

04:41.462 --> 04:42.083
Most of the time you knew them.

04:43.058 --> 04:44.680
All right, student diversity.

04:46.082 --> 04:48.065
Were there any Hispanic students?

04:50.368 --> 04:55.035
Did y'all identify them in any way different from the others?

04:55.055 --> 04:55.356
No, not really.

04:55.376 --> 05:12.340
Did they have, they didn't... Were there some Mexican-Americans?

05:13.855 --> 05:19.181
What about Jewish students?

05:19.201 --> 05:22.245
Did y'all have a special reference title for them?

05:27.491 --> 05:29.493
Were there many international students?

05:31.776 --> 05:41.106
Where were they from primarily?

05:41.126 --> 05:41.787
Mexico.

05:42.205 --> 05:57.307
Alright, we got two more questions then.

05:57.327 --> 06:03.335
As you're getting ready to leave with your degree, what kind of world did you think you were entering?

06:04.036 --> 06:05.158
What did you think was ahead of it?

06:13.964 --> 06:25.325
All right.

06:25.505 --> 06:33.260
After the Army, what did you think you were going to do?

06:33.280 --> 06:36.546
Well, I had a job at that time.

06:48.322 --> 07:04.497
Did they give you any indication what your pay would be with Humble?

07:04.517 --> 07:09.322
Did they come to the campus to do anything?

07:09.762 --> 07:15.207
Now what was your pay as a Second Lieutenant?

07:16.655 --> 07:20.602
And you had a three-year obligation or two?

07:22.045 --> 07:22.566
I don't really know.

07:22.626 --> 07:23.367
You had a contract?

07:25.050 --> 07:25.151
Yeah.

07:25.171 --> 07:29.338
About how many remained in the Corps their junior and senior year?

07:31.903 --> 07:32.584
Did everybody?

07:36.311 --> 07:40.198
Well, the people weren't, you know, they weren't they students.

07:40.398 --> 07:46.767
All the sophomores are continuing on.

07:47.187 --> 07:53.456
They've been attritioned each year.

07:53.476 --> 07:57.982
All right, then the important question.

07:59.344 --> 08:03.470
What did it mean to you, your life, that you went to Texas A&M?

08:04.751 --> 08:09.578
It's probably the most important thing in certain young life.

08:10.064 --> 08:36.409
Why?

08:36.743 --> 08:57.942
Why did you develop this deep love and gratitude for A&M?

09:01.567 --> 09:25.477
A&M gave me an opportunity to develop whatever talents I had.

09:25.497 --> 09:26.458
And you know, you get older, you recommend that.

09:26.478 --> 09:27.819
And you see kids that are following, and they may have a direction.

09:27.839 --> 09:29.702
And some I know, even now, they're physical A&M's and they get a better direction than I can.

09:29.722 --> 09:30.763
And students I see going somewhere, who worships me.

09:34.186 --> 09:53.360
I'm not alone in sharing the fact that they were very important.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.422
And then the fellowship and the willingness to help.

09:55.988 --> 10:09.605
Let's see, that's the important one I forgot.

10:10.506 --> 10:22.080
Do you know anything about the TT's and any other supposed secret fraternities when you were there?

10:22.988 --> 10:48.333
Maybe three four guys got together and said, you can do something with it.

10:48.353 --> 10:49.454
Most of the elections are all the head court elections.

10:49.474 --> 10:50.475
I think these were the archery and the infantry, .

10:50.495 --> 10:50.515
.

10:50.535 --> 10:50.555
.

10:50.575 --> 10:50.595
.

10:50.615 --> 10:50.635
.

10:50.655 --> 10:50.675
.

10:50.695 --> 10:50.715
.

10:50.735 --> 10:50.755
.

10:50.775 --> 10:50.795
.

10:50.815 --> 10:50.835
.

10:51.575 --> 11:15.827
What was the most prestigious appointment or selection or election that an undergraduate could have?

11:20.684 --> 11:25.994
Did you by chance know Woody Varner?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.321
He's a class ahead of you.

11:33.990 --> 11:37.637
Durwood T. Varner from Cottonwood, Texas.

11:40.904 --> 11:41.545
Let's quit there.
