00:02.832 --> 00:18.529
one two three four testing murray now you say something hello hello i'm here this is september the 12th and i have the pleasure and honor of chatting

03:18.920 --> 03:21.664
postdoctoral role while I joined the faculty at Cornell.

03:23.286 --> 03:40.051
Dr. Morris Bloodworth who was head of the department at Texas A&M during those years and who had served on my master's committee had told me at many professional meetings that it was just a matter of time until he recruited me back to Texas A&M for faculty.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.117
So after I'd been at Cornell five years,

03:44.907 --> 03:48.031
Dr. Bloodworth came along with a faculty offer.

03:48.271 --> 03:52.136
By that time, I'd developed quite a good feel for Cornell.

03:52.576 --> 04:00.826
Really was uncertain about whether I would be granted tenure there or not, and knew if I was not going to receive tenure, a decision would be a very easy one.

04:01.747 --> 04:14.442
But I did receive tenure in those months and actually served on the Cornell faculty as an associate professor for two months back to Texas A&M.

04:15.130 --> 04:19.741
That was probably the hardest professional decision I've ever made.

04:19.801 --> 04:25.815
You can look back even to this day and wonder, I guess, in some respects, whether it was the right decision or not.

04:26.302 --> 04:28.526
Well a lot of things played into it.

04:28.926 --> 04:36.860
We were about 1800 miles from my family and we were a thousand miles from my wife's family and they were a thousand miles apart.

04:37.962 --> 04:52.005
And that made any kind of, well it took all the vacation that we had in the summer in those days with young children to, we'd spend three weeks vacation and we'd spend about half of it on the road.

04:52.559 --> 04:56.454
And so that was a strong motivating factor.

04:56.936 --> 05:02.637
I did not know whether my wife, who was a native of Wisconsin, whom I met during my PhD years,

09:18.593 --> 09:26.790
more familiar with the soils than the state, and to interact with Dr. Dixon, who preceded me here by about two months.

09:27.711 --> 09:30.557
So we had the same kinds of research interests.

09:32.261 --> 09:35.387
Well, it really

09:49.930 --> 10:14.692
Ms.

10:14.712 --> 10:14.892
Carthage.

10:15.361 --> 10:18.985
And then Chambers County, I remember down on the Gulf Coast.

10:19.626 --> 10:24.591
And those were all one-week stays and seen very extensively.

10:24.651 --> 10:31.018
Those would come during what we call a final field review for the survey of those counties, the soil survey.

10:31.678 --> 10:44.592
So you go to all parts of the county and you see the major kinds of soils that occur in that environment and discuss all of the different controversies about how to classify them and their uses and limitations and that kind of thing.

10:44.875 --> 10:51.962
That was an extremely fortunate to have that luxury in time, I suppose you'd say, in the first year.

10:53.464 --> 11:10.501
But to this day, I use a lot of slides in teaching the introductory soils course that I got in that first nine months I was here, and not to mention just the knowledge and appreciation for the variety of soils in the state.

11:10.521 --> 11:14.545
What else did you learn about the people of Texas and their variety?

11:15.301 --> 11:26.537
Well, I don't know if, of course, I grew up in Texas, and since I went to A&M, I guess you could say I had classmates from all parts of the state.

11:28.741 --> 11:40.077
One of the things when I first began teaching that truly shocked me was the variety in terms of origin and surnames that students had in class in Texas as compared to New York State.

11:40.192 --> 11:50.809
If you'd asked me offhand, I would have said there would have been a lot greater cultural diversity in the student body at Cornell University than there would be at Texas A&M.

11:51.390 --> 11:52.692
That's not the case.

11:53.032 --> 11:58.521
There's a much, I immediately encountered so many different

11:59.243 --> 12:07.471
from all over Eastern Europe and Germany, and not to mention the Hispanic influence here as compared to New York.

12:07.551 --> 12:19.503
So about the only thing you could say at Cornell, in contrast, would be a much greater Jewish presence among the students at Cornell than here.

12:20.804 --> 12:29.132
I didn't recognize, at that time I wouldn't recognize the Jewish surname from any other name, but I had a lab technician who was quite good at it.

12:29.382 --> 12:59.389
and had some had some prejudices so he he didn't hesitate to express his feelings about so they incidentally the Jewish students at Cornell were outstanding students in the classroom exceptional students describe uh you're getting settled into the department where was it about how many people who were the key leaders of the department at in 1968 1968

13:00.095 --> 13:12.251
Morris Bloodworth became head in 1963 and continued in that role until 1979, so he was obviously the kingpin in the department at that time.

13:12.272 --> 13:16.097
Actually, the department probably had more graduate students at that time than it has today.

13:16.137 --> 13:29.595
The faculty was not as large, although it, Dr. Bloodworth hired his first faculty member, I believe, in 1964 or 5.

13:30.284 --> 13:40.403
And in 1968, counting faculty here and off campus, I believe, I believe there were five or six employees in that year alone.

13:41.745 --> 13:51.263
And then continuing through the mid-70s, there was a considerable addition to the faculty in terms of breadth of expertise.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.865
in soil science as well as other disciplines.

13:54.905 --> 14:05.168
So that was a period, well, a period for the entire university, but it was a period of very rapid growth for the department, and I think that was primarily his leadership.

14:05.249 --> 14:09.859
I think almost anybody even today here would tell you that

14:10.092 --> 14:19.106
Marsh Bloodworth, and as I mentioned, O.D., and maybe Perry, they got the lion's share of the increases that were enjoyed during those early years.

14:21.109 --> 14:25.656
George Coonsie had already moved to the graduate college when I got here.

14:26.197 --> 14:33.889
Jack Ruckels was soon to become director of Water Resources Institute, so Jack would have been a leader, but

14:34.105 --> 14:37.631
Gosh, there were a number of other faculty members.

14:37.851 --> 14:42.459
About how many total in the department?

14:42.479 --> 14:43.421
Gosh.

14:43.641 --> 14:52.116
On campus, probably, and this is a wild guess, I don't know, probably 30, I'm guessing.

14:53.117 --> 14:57.104
What do you think the national reputation of the department was then?

14:58.066 --> 14:58.847
Not very good.

14:59.924 --> 15:08.234
I think you can generally say that for most, but by that time, by that time recognized as an up and coming place.

15:09.055 --> 15:23.472
Because we'd already, by that time, just beginning to see really the takeoff that stemmed from all of those decisions that Dr. Rudder was instrumental in making and bringing to fruition.

15:24.173 --> 15:29.880
So the enrollment was definitely on the upswing, beginning to hire faculty,

15:31.025 --> 15:44.525
having a lot of retirements of some people who had done, had performed yeoman service, but of an entirely different type than faculty to give you any kind of national presence we'd give.

15:44.686 --> 15:49.433
Where were you all located and what were your facilities here on campus?

15:49.994 --> 15:52.277
Well, the department's always been in several buildings.

15:53.018 --> 15:57.485
As large as the facilities we have now, you'd think we'd all be in one building, but we aren't.

15:58.226 --> 15:59.428
At that time,

15:59.408 --> 16:02.393
I was housed in what is now the Butler Building.

16:02.633 --> 16:05.558
It was known then as the Gromby Building.

16:05.578 --> 16:13.091
And the building next to it, we referred to as the old red brick building, and most of the soils faculty were in that building.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.494
I was never housed in that building.

16:14.514 --> 16:15.936
That's over near the system?

16:16.377 --> 16:19.442
Yeah, the Butler Building is...

16:19.777 --> 16:26.002
kind of across from the old physics building and the Trigon, the military science building.

16:26.022 --> 16:32.088
The one with the big columns in front, if you look at the MSC area, you look right into the agronomy building.

16:32.108 --> 16:43.558
And the old red brick building, it's no longer red, but it still stands, was immediately next to that one on the northwest, I guess you'd say, side.

16:43.738 --> 16:48.602
So it would be, in a sense, further up the street toward the Cushing Library at that time.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.200
So we occupied primarily those two buildings.

16:53.801 --> 16:57.526
Shared the state chemist at that time was in the old red and big building.

16:57.586 --> 17:00.611
In fact, it was called a state chemist building.

17:00.631 --> 17:02.593
But a lot of the soils back were living there.

17:02.673 --> 17:05.357
It was a dungeon.

17:06.539 --> 17:10.104
No air conditioning, no central air in any of those buildings at that time.

17:10.705 --> 17:11.946
All window air conditioning.

17:13.208 --> 17:17.594
Where were the labs that you and other and your colleagues used for your instruction?

17:17.794 --> 17:18.235
Well,

17:19.143 --> 17:26.331
The lab that I used was on the first, in the kind of basement, half basement in the old agronomy building.

17:26.351 --> 17:32.097
I mean, it had windows, but it was mostly below ground, half and half.

17:33.979 --> 17:41.748
The man who had been teaching that position had, well, it really wasn't his first love.

17:41.768 --> 17:44.330
He taught a senior level course before teaching that.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.753
He was known for being

17:47.442 --> 17:48.804
reasonably cantankerous.

17:49.806 --> 17:55.736
And then there was a fellow that preceded him whose nickname was Whiskey Jack.

17:55.757 --> 18:00.525
Guys used to talk about finding him inebriated on lab benches at times.

18:00.545 --> 18:10.362
I would say that that basic soils course, which is very important in the entire agricultural activity,

18:12.451 --> 18:18.039
It needed some attention and the lab was, oh, it was in pitiful shape.

18:18.920 --> 18:29.174
And my predecessor was in it through the fall and spring of 1968-69 and my first teaching at Texas A&M was in the summer of 1969.

18:30.176 --> 18:37.446
So I had, I couldn't, I didn't have any access to the facility until he was gone.

18:37.932 --> 18:42.401
I think it's fair to say I've never worked harder in my life than I worked that summer.

18:42.721 --> 18:51.398
As you, during that first year, what kind of advice did anyone give you about being a faculty member here or anything like that?

18:53.302 --> 18:56.548
Did anybody give you any guidelines or rules or...

18:57.457 --> 19:01.442
No, you know, I don't remember being given a lot of advice.

19:01.642 --> 19:13.416
I guess I probably got as much advice from Dean Kunkle as anybody, although I didn't spend a lot of time with Dean Kunkle, but he was always philosophized with you a little bit.

19:14.778 --> 19:23.008
Dr. Potts, of course, was an institution at that time in the College of Agriculture as associate dean.

19:23.545 --> 19:27.316
I'd have to give him a lot of credit in this sense.

19:27.417 --> 19:36.002
In those first two or three years, he encouraged me to go to regional teaching workshops.

19:37.197 --> 19:51.084
anything that came up that I think he thought would be any kind of help or guidance in teaching, he was very eager to encourage you to take part in it.

19:52.066 --> 19:55.392
Dr. Bloodworth would always support him, but he'd never think about

19:55.372 --> 20:00.018
having somebody look for those kinds of opportunities, Dr. Potts did.

20:00.779 --> 20:10.953
And so he had a major role in getting me out to learn about developments in the technological aspect of the teaching at that time.

20:11.914 --> 20:14.458
And it was extremely supportive.

20:14.478 --> 20:23.370
Within the department, actually the man I followed had been the graduate advisor for the department.

20:23.924 --> 20:34.423
and in addition to teaching the undergraduate course I almost inherited that role and that meant almost from day one while I didn't have

20:34.808 --> 20:42.800
graduate students myself, other than some, well, I did have a few, but very few along.

20:42.820 --> 21:01.727
But basically, I interacted with all of the faculty in that role as graduate advisor, so I had a lot of opportunity to interact with other faculty members across a pretty, I mean, our department represents a wide variety of disciplines.

21:02.011 --> 21:07.061
So I had an opportunity to interact with a lot of people that I wouldn't have otherwise.

21:07.742 --> 21:08.363
What was it?

21:09.005 --> 21:11.810
Now you were a former student from this department.

21:13.093 --> 21:20.948
Did that turn out to be an advantage, a disadvantage, or a mixed blessing as you were a young new faculty member?

21:21.265 --> 21:24.370
I was obviously getting a job in the first place.

21:26.835 --> 21:29.539
I don't think it had anything to do.

21:30.120 --> 21:33.085
None of the veterans came in to talk down to you?

21:33.646 --> 21:34.608
No, no, I never.

21:37.533 --> 21:41.159
So many of us were new at the same time.

21:41.560 --> 21:46.328
What did you and your colleagues think were the unspoken, unwritten

21:46.578 --> 21:52.145
guidelines about when you went to work, what you wore, how you did your job.

21:52.566 --> 21:58.654
What did you assume were the guidelines for you as a professional?

21:58.674 --> 22:02.920
Well, I expect most of us thought we ought to be at work at 8 o'clock in the morning.

22:02.980 --> 22:04.843
We ought to stay there till 5.

22:04.983 --> 22:08.147
And obviously all of us were 12-month employees.

22:08.347 --> 22:12.952
We felt unless it was a holiday or we were on vacation, we should be there.

22:14.394 --> 22:25.466
Now his dress was, I think most of us always wore a tie when we were going to the classroom.

22:25.486 --> 22:31.412
But a lot of the work of faculty in the department's always been field oriented.

22:31.432 --> 22:37.459
So I think it's always been acceptable if you were not in the classroom to,

22:37.793 --> 22:40.637
Dress casually.

22:40.657 --> 22:49.989
And you're, beginning in 69, what were your responsibilities for courses and so forth in the early years?

22:50.430 --> 22:52.453
What courses were you to teach?

22:52.933 --> 23:03.147
Oh, well, you know, this is, but pretty much throughout my entire career, my major responsibility in teaching has been one course.

23:03.167 --> 23:05.951
It's been the introductory course in soil science.

23:06.211 --> 23:06.872
What number?

23:07.409 --> 23:08.690
Agronomy 301.

23:09.171 --> 23:12.614
Did it have a nickname among the students?

23:12.674 --> 23:17.438
Well, I've heard it referred to as Murray Milford's Magical Mystery Hour.

23:17.458 --> 23:25.125
Some of the students went out one year and bought t-shirts and came back in with them on.

23:25.145 --> 23:29.348
They had Milford's clods on the back of their teeth.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.810
And this is normally to juniors?

23:32.931 --> 23:35.914
It's a junior level course, but it's taken...

23:36.350 --> 23:48.841
by anything from sophomores to graduate students and probably most of those most of the years I've taught it it's been maybe more juniors than anything else but next to that seniors.

23:49.662 --> 23:56.428
Enrollments ranged all the way from I guess when I first started around 100 students a semester.

23:57.168 --> 24:00.791
We've always taught it fall, spring and summer.

24:01.392 --> 24:04.855
I've not missed since

24:07.467 --> 24:16.126
Well, since the summer of 69, I've not missed a summer, fall, or spring to teach that course.

24:16.166 --> 24:21.578
Now, the enrollment went as high as 426.

24:22.621 --> 24:24.723
And I had them all that semester.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.606
Shortly thereafter, we were able to add some faculty.

24:27.626 --> 24:32.391
So there have been a couple of other people who have taught the course.

24:33.172 --> 24:40.799
And this is the basic course for anyone majoring in soil and crop sciences, and what else?

24:40.819 --> 24:42.180
It's been a required course.

24:42.201 --> 24:49.328
Of course, it's required for all the students that are major, but it's been a required course in many other disciplines over the years.

24:49.708 --> 24:51.750
Not as many today as in the past.

24:52.152 --> 25:08.174
But when I came here, it was required for all students in animal science, recreation parks, horticulture, agricultural education, rangeland ecology and management.

25:08.334 --> 25:10.056
It would have been range science back then.

25:12.139 --> 25:21.872
Plant science is strongly recommended in a couple of areas, ag economics, wildlife and fisheries required in part of there.

25:22.223 --> 25:31.516
programs, always had some students from geology, some study in earth science for teaching purposes.

25:32.237 --> 25:35.161
No engineers, no MEs?

25:35.422 --> 25:38.126
No agricultural engineering, it was required in ag engineers.

25:38.486 --> 25:38.947
Oh, okay.

25:38.967 --> 25:40.950
But not none of the others.

25:40.970 --> 25:46.037
What were you, as you started out in that course, what were your

25:47.772 --> 25:53.239
private guidelines for how you were hoping to do the course.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.842
For you as a teacher, what was your philosophy?

25:58.104 --> 26:05.974
Well, I really don't know all the things that shaped how I put the course together.

26:06.214 --> 26:13.102
I suppose you could say I was strongly influenced by what I found at Cornell when I began teaching there.

26:13.803 --> 26:17.087
The textbook used for the course there was

26:17.455 --> 26:20.243
at that time called Buckman and Brady.

26:20.263 --> 26:26.941
It goes back into, the textbook is now in its 12th edition, I believe.

26:26.962 --> 26:30.030
It goes back into the 1920s, probably.

26:30.854 --> 26:36.439
And Dr. Brady was the department head, actually.

26:36.479 --> 26:39.562
He moved to the department head when I became a member of the faculty.

26:39.982 --> 26:43.926
But we alternated teaching that course there.

26:44.847 --> 26:50.992
One fella taught it in the fall, I taught it in the spring, and then we alternated in the summer to teach it.

26:52.013 --> 26:59.460
And this fella had more experience with that course than I did, but we met together every summer.

27:00.149 --> 27:02.933
and went over the content of the laboratory.

27:02.953 --> 27:04.074
He has a laboratory with it.

27:04.114 --> 27:08.080
So we, in effect, redid the laboratory exercises every summer.

27:08.700 --> 27:11.104
And so I had a chance to make inputs into those.

27:11.124 --> 27:23.680
So I guess the content was pretty much shaped to that, although the fellow that I took introductory soils from in Texas A&M was a man named Hank Foth.

27:23.941 --> 27:24.902
F-O-T-H?

27:24.922 --> 27:25.583
F-O-T-H.

27:26.643 --> 27:36.779
He was only at Texas A&M three years when he went to Michigan State, which I believe was his alma mater, and he spent the rest of his career there.

27:37.620 --> 27:44.130
He gave, I thought he was an excellent teacher, and subsequently I think Michigan State proved that.

27:44.992 --> 27:46.394
He wrote a textbook as well.

27:47.936 --> 27:54.186
His textbook I got a lot of ideas from, but it was not nearly as,

27:56.005 --> 28:02.957
Oh, meaty's probably the right term, as the one that we had at Cornell.

28:02.977 --> 28:08.186
So I used, I used, but I took ideas from it.

28:08.206 --> 28:10.830
And that's how we developed the course.

28:11.010 --> 28:20.747
And I would say it is not, it's not, as far as the organization and topics treated, it's not changed substantially over the years.

28:21.267 --> 28:29.897
with the big emphasis on behavioral objectives or instructional objectives that was beginning to be a big deal in the late 60s and early 70s.

28:31.098 --> 28:36.724
I totally did instructional objectives, which I had not done before for it.

28:36.744 --> 28:45.714
Somewhere early on, and I, you know, right now I'm not at all sure whether I started doing it at Cornell or not, but I think maybe I did.

28:46.375 --> 28:50.920
Remember, I was on the faculty there from 1963 to 1968.

28:52.098 --> 29:02.151
It was during a period, Vietnam, during a period where I think faculty became very hesitant to say anything controversial to students.

29:03.172 --> 29:04.174
You weren't supposed to.

29:06.296 --> 29:21.396
I'm not, and I'm not honestly not sure when I started doing it, but I started early on to think that in addition to trying to teach subject matter, cognitive subject matter, the faculty member had about as much responsibility to try to

29:22.473 --> 29:28.159
be a witness to life, philosophize a little bit about life and what it is all about.

29:28.219 --> 29:31.722
So I would always editorialize.

29:32.023 --> 29:35.166
And when I started doing this, I'm not sure, but I did it at Cornell.

29:35.186 --> 29:38.750
I know the idea for doing it was developed there, and I think I probably did.

29:40.631 --> 29:44.395
So I always tell my classes, first five minutes are mine.

29:44.455 --> 29:46.137
We talk about whatever we want to.

29:47.118 --> 29:51.062
You know, this semester I've already talked about bonfire.

29:51.346 --> 30:16.170
I've talked about credit cards and their use, talked about alcohol, talked about silver taps being an important tradition, urge them to participate, talked about being environmentally aware, take trash out of the classroom, close doors behind you when you go in and out of bed.

30:17.692 --> 30:21.015
So I've done that kind of thing.

30:21.198 --> 30:34.399
Yeah, and I have a final editorial that runs about 25 minutes, which is, that's the only time that I make any overt statement about being a Christian, but I do in that final 25 minutes of class.

30:34.419 --> 30:37.924
And what's been the reaction, you think, over the years?

30:37.944 --> 30:42.051
More favorable comments about the editorials on the Course Critique questionnaire and anything else.

30:44.214 --> 30:49.062
We'll get somewhere between two and five comments in the vein of

30:49.717 --> 30:53.043
I'll pay my money to take soil science.

30:53.063 --> 30:54.405
I'll hear your philosophy.

30:55.887 --> 31:04.963
I've never been bothered by those because I feel like at least once a try I've pricked them in a pretty sensitive spot.

31:05.083 --> 31:12.615
In all of your teaching, did you have any role models that affected the way you did it?

31:13.176 --> 31:14.338
Probably my mother and dad.

31:14.739 --> 31:15.420
Okay.

31:15.907 --> 31:19.153
bigger role models than anybody.

31:21.417 --> 31:22.959
I come from family teachers.

31:24.682 --> 31:29.871
My mother was teacher, her sisters were teachers, her brother was teachers.

31:30.312 --> 31:32.616
So there were four of them, they were all teachers.
