00:02.410 --> 00:04.630
One, two, three, four, testing. Murray, now you 
say something. Hello, hello, I'm here.

00:11.640 --> 03:19.930
This

00:11.640 --> 03:19.930
is September the 12th, and I have the pleasure and 
honor of chatting with the postdoctoral role

03:19.910 --> 03:21.411
while I join the faculty at Cornell. Dr. Morris 
Bloodworth, who was head of the department at

03:22.930 --> 03:29.130
Texas A&M during those years and who had served on 
my master's committee, had told me at many

03:32.230 --> 03:36.550
professional meetings that it was just a matter of 
time until he would recruit me back to Texas A&M for

03:36.530 --> 03:39.950
faculty. So after I'd been at Cornell five years, 
Dr. Bloodworth came along with a faculty offer. By

03:47.970 --> 03:51.930
that time, I'd developed quite a good feel for 
Cornell. Really was uncertain about whether I

03:52.470 --> 03:56.130
would be granted tenure there or not and knew if I 
was not going to receive tenure, the decision

03:56.110 --> 04:00.850
would be a very easy one. But

04:01.730 --> 04:10.900
if I actually served on the Cornell faculty as an 
associate professor for two months, I'd have to go

04:10.900 --> 04:14.420
back to Texas A&M. That was probably the hardest 
professional decision I've ever made. You can

04:19.780 --> 04:23.760
look back even to this day and wonder, I guess, in 
some respects, whether it was the right decision

04:23.860 --> 04:25.600
or not. A lot of things played into it. We were about 
1,800 miles from my family, and we were 1,000 miles

04:32.840 --> 04:35.220
from my wife's family, and they were 1,000 miles 
apart. And that made any kind of, well, it took all

04:37.960 --> 04:42.780
the vacation. We had in the summer in those days 
with young children to, we'd spend three weeks

04:47.560 --> 04:51.720
vacation and we'd spend about half of it on the 
road. And so that was a strong motivating factor. I

04:56.800 --> 05:00.380
did not know whether my wife, who was a native of 
Wisconsin, whom I met during my Ph.D. years,

09:19.340 --> 09:21.320
more familiar with the soil than the state, and to 
interact with Dr. Dixon, who preceded me here by

09:21.680 --> 09:26.820
about two months. So we had the same kind... We had 
the same kinds of research interests. Well, it

09:32.370 --> 09:33.391
really...

10:15.570 --> 10:19.190
And then Chambers County, I remember, down on the 
Gulf Coast, and those were all one-week stays and

10:19.670 --> 10:24.890
seen very extensively. Those would come during 
what we call a final field review for the survey of

10:28.470 --> 10:31.290
those counties, the soil survey. So you go to all 
the parts of the county and you see the major kinds

10:31.770 --> 10:36.090
of soils that occur in that environment and 
discuss all of the different controversies about

10:40.370 --> 10:41.291
how to classify them. and their uses and 
limitations and that kind of thing. That was an

10:44.770 --> 10:50.190
extremely fortunate to have that luxury and time, 
I suppose you'd say, in the first year. But to this

10:53.240 --> 10:58.460
day, I use a lot of slides in teaching the 
introductory soils course that I got in that first

10:58.540 --> 11:02.860
nine months I was here. And not to mention just the 
knowledge and appreciation for the variety of

11:03.240 --> 11:10.260
soils in the state. What else did you learn about 
the people of Texas and their variety from those

11:11.540 --> 11:16.980
weeks? Well, I don't know if, of course, I grew up in 
Texas, and since I went to A&M, I guess you could say

11:21.450 --> 11:26.870
I had classmates from all parts of the state. One of 
the things when I first began teaching that truly

11:28.650 --> 11:32.370
shocked me was the variety in terms of origin of 
surnames of students I had in class in Texas as

11:38.150 --> 11:39.870
compared to New York State. If you'd asked me 
offhand, I would have said there would have been a

11:41.550 --> 11:45.570
lot greater cultural diversity in the student 
body at Cornell University than there would be at

11:45.650 --> 11:50.770
Texas A&M. That's not the case. There's a much, I 
immediately encountered so many different from

11:52.250 --> 12:00.770
all over Eastern Europe and Germany and those, not 
to mention the Hispanic influence here as

12:00.850 --> 12:07.370
compared to New York. So, about the only thing you 
could say is that at Cornell, in contrast, would be

12:10.150 --> 12:17.510
a much greater Jewish presence among the students 
at Cornell than here. I didn't recognize, at that

12:19.990 --> 12:26.490
time, I wouldn't have recognized a Jewish surname 
from any other name, but I had a lab technician who

12:26.570 --> 12:31.590
was quite good at it and had some prejudices, so he 
didn't hesitate to express his feelings about

12:31.670 --> 12:37.890
some. Incidentally, the Jewish students at 
Cornell were outstanding students in the

12:40.470 --> 12:44.400
classroom, exceptional students. Describe your 
getting settled into the department. Where was

12:49.380 --> 12:52.600
it, about how many people, who were the key leaders 
of the department in 1968? That became head in 1963

12:58.480 --> 13:06.100
and continued in that role until 1979, so he was 
obviously the kingpin in the department at that

13:06.180 --> 13:12.110
time. Actually, the department probably had more 
graduate students at that time than it has today.

13:17.390 --> 13:23.380
The faculty was not as large, although it, Dr. 
Bloodworth hired his first faculty member, I

13:23.460 --> 13:30.390
believe, in 1964 or five. And in 1968, counting 
faculty here and off campus, I believe there were

13:35.570 --> 13:41.640
five or six employees in that year alone. And then 
continuing through the mid-'70s, there was a

13:44.580 --> 13:48.800
considerable addition to the faculty in terms of 
breadth of expertise in soil science as well as

13:48.880 --> 13:54.900
other disciplines. So that was a period, well, a 
period for the entire university, but it was a

13:58.380 --> 14:02.500
period of very rapid growth for the department, 
and I think that was primarily his leadership. I

14:05.280 --> 14:08.500
think almost anybody, even today here, would tell 
you that Morris Bloodworth and, as I mentioned,

14:08.580 --> 14:12.631
O.D. and maybe Perry, they've got the lion's share 
of the increases that were enjoyed during those

14:17.180 --> 14:20.800
early years. George Kunze had already moved to the 
graduate college when I got here. Jack Ruckles was

14:26.180 --> 14:31.900
soon to become director of Water Resources 
Institute, so Jack would have been a leader, but

14:33.680 --> 14:38.200
gosh, there were a number of other faculty 
members. About how many

14:38.280 --> 14:43.500
total? On campus, probably, and this is a wild 
guess, I don't know, probably 30, I'm guessing,

14:46.880 --> 14:52.950
30. What do you think the national reputation of 
the department was then? Not very good. I think you

15:00.080 --> 15:03.100
could generally say that for most, but by that 
time, by that time, recognized as an

15:03.180 --> 15:09.000
up-and-coming place. Because we'd already, by 
that time, just beginning to see really the

15:09.080 --> 15:15.700
takeoff that stemmed from all the, all the 
decisions that Dr. Rudder was instrumental in

15:19.472 --> 15:24.100
making and bringing to fruition. So the 
enrollment was definitely on the upswing,

15:27.780 --> 15:31.200
beginning to hire faculty, having a lot of 
retirements of some people who had done, had

15:35.280 --> 15:37.000
performed yeoman service, but of an entirely 
different type than faculty to give you any kind of

15:37.080 --> 15:44.700
national presence would give. Where were you all 
located and what were your facilities? Well, the

15:47.980 --> 15:52.900
department's always been in several buildings. 
As large a facility as we have now, you'd think we'd

15:52.980 --> 15:57.900
all be in one building, but we aren't. At that time, 
I was housed in what is now the Butler Building. It

16:02.580 --> 16:05.160
was known then as the Gromby Building. And the 
building next to it, we referred to as the old red

16:05.240 --> 16:10.260
brick building, and most of the soils faculty were 
in that building. Now, that's over near the

16:13.240 --> 16:16.160
system? Yeah. The Butler Building is the, is kind 
of across from the old physics building and the

16:17.064 --> 16:24.660
trigon, the old theory science building. The one 
with the big columns in front, you look down at the

16:26.140 --> 16:29.860
MSD area, you look right into the Gromby Building. 
And the old red brick building, it's no longer red,

16:32.140 --> 16:37.660
but it still stands, was immediately next to that 
one on the northwest side. So it would be, in a

16:43.790 --> 16:47.910
sense, further up the street toward the Cushing 
Library at that time. So we occupied primarily

16:48.090 --> 16:52.840
those two buildings. Shared the state chemist at 
that time was in the old red brick building. In

16:57.360 --> 16:59.780
fact, it was called the state chemist building. 
But a lot of the soils faculty were in there. It was

17:02.300 --> 17:04.220
a, it was a dungeon. No air conditioning, no 
central air in any of those buildings at that time.

17:09.860 --> 17:11.960
All window air conditioning. Where were the labs 
that you and other, and your colleagues used for

17:12.040 --> 17:17.590
your instruction? Well, the lab that I used was on 
the first, in the kind of basement, half basement

17:21.720 --> 17:26.240
in the old Gromby Building. I mean, it had windows, 
but it was mostly below ground, half and half. The

17:31.410 --> 17:41.490
man who had been teaching in that position had, 
well, it really wasn't his first love. He'd taught

17:41.570 --> 17:44.490
a senior level course before teaching that. He was 
known for being reasonably cantankerous. And

17:49.570 --> 17:53.890
then there was a fellow that preceded him, his 
nickname was Whiskey Jack. Guys used to talk about

17:55.970 --> 17:59.890
finding him inebriated on lab benches at times. I 
would say that basic soils course, which is very

17:59.970 --> 18:09.140
important in the entire agricultural activity, 
it

18:09.220 --> 18:14.730
needed, it needed some attention. And the lab was, 
oh, it was in pitiful shape. And my predecessor was

18:18.810 --> 18:24.730
in it through the fall and spring of 1968-69. And my 
first teacher, my second teacher was in the summer

18:25.910 --> 18:29.730
of 1969. So I had, I couldn't, I didn't have any 
access to the facility until he was gone. I think

18:37.840 --> 18:41.760
it's fair to say I've never worked harder in my life 
than I worked that summer. As you, during that

18:41.840 --> 18:47.780
first year, what kind of advice did anyone give you 
about being a faculty member here or anything like

18:47.860 --> 18:51.780
that? Did anybody give you any guidelines or rules 
or? No, you know, I don't remember being given a lot

18:56.820 --> 19:01.330
of advice. I guess I probably got as much advice 
from Dean Kunkle as anybody, although I didn't

19:06.410 --> 19:09.330
spend a lot of time with Dean Kunkle. But he was 
always philosophized with you a little bit. Dr.

19:14.410 --> 19:21.330
Potts, of course, was an institution at that time 
in the College of Agriculture as Associate Dean.

19:21.410 --> 19:27.450
And I'll have to give, I'll have to give him a lot of 
credit in this sense. In those first two or three

19:27.430 --> 19:35.350
years, he encouraged me to go to regional teaching 
workshops. And anything that came up that I think

19:35.430 --> 19:45.600
he thought would be any kind of help or guidance in 
teaching, he was very eager to encourage you to

19:45.680 --> 19:51.600
take part in it. Dr. Bloodworth would always 
support him, but he'd never think about having

19:51.680 --> 19:57.600
somebody look. For those kinds of opportunities, 
Dr. Potts did. And so he had a major role in getting

20:00.680 --> 20:07.600
me out to learn about developments in the 
technological aspect of the teaching at that

20:07.680 --> 20:11.600
time. And was extremely supportive. Within the 
department,

20:14.700 --> 20:23.930
actually the man I followed had been the graduate 
advisor for the department. And in addition to

20:24.010 --> 20:28.930
teaching the undergraduate course, I almost 
inherited that role. And that meant almost from

20:29.010 --> 20:36.930
day one, while I didn't have graduate students 
myself, other than some, well, I did have a few, but

20:37.010 --> 20:42.930
very few along. But basically, I interacted with 
all of the faculty in that role as graduate

20:43.010 --> 20:48.930
advisor. So I had a lot of opportunity to interact 
with other faculty members across a pretty, I mean

20:57.910 --> 21:01.920
our department represents a wide variety of 
disciplines. So I had an opportunity to interact

21:02.000 --> 21:06.920
with a lot of people that I wouldn't have 
otherwise. What was it, now you were a former

21:07.000 --> 21:11.920
student from this department. Did that turn out to 
be an advantage, a disadvantage, or a mixed

21:12.000 --> 21:20.920
blessing as you were a young, new faculty member? 
It was obviously an advantage in getting a job in

21:21.000 --> 21:26.200
the first place. I don't think it had anything to 
do, most... None of the veterans came in to talk

21:30.180 --> 21:33.100
down to you or anything? No, no. A lot of them, so 
many of us were at the same time. What did you and

21:41.060 --> 21:48.980
your colleagues think were the unspoken, 
unwritten guidelines about when you went to work,

21:49.060 --> 21:51.980
what you wore, how you did your job? What did you 
assume were the guidelines for you as a

21:52.060 --> 21:58.280
professional? Well, I expect most of us thought we 
ought to be at work at 8 o'clock in the morning, we

22:02.360 --> 22:07.280
ought to stay there till 5, and obviously all of us 
were 12 month employees. So we thought unless it

22:07.360 --> 22:14.280
was a holiday or we were on vacation, we should be 
there. And how did you... Now the dress was,

22:15.360 --> 22:25.500
I think most of us always wore a tie when we were 
going to the classroom. But a lot of the work of

22:25.580 --> 22:31.500
faculty in the department has always been field 
oriented. So I think it's always been acceptable,

22:31.480 --> 22:39.400
if you were not in the classroom, to dress 
casually. And you're, beginning in 69, what were

22:39.480 --> 22:49.930
your responsibilities for courses and so forth in 
the early years? What courses were you to teach?

22:53.010 --> 22:58.990
Oh, well, you know, this is, but pretty much 
throughout my entire career, my major

22:59.070 --> 23:01.990
responsibility in teaching has been one course. 
It's been the introductory course in soil

23:02.170 --> 23:05.990
science. What number? Agronomy 301. Did it have a 
nickname among the students? Well, I've heard it

23:12.070 --> 23:17.080
referred to as Murray Milford's Magical Mystery 
Hour. Okay, okay. Some of the students went out one

23:20.738 --> 23:25.100
year and bought t-shirts and came back in with them 
on. They had Milford's clods on the back of their

23:25.180 --> 23:29.100
t-shirts. And this is normally to juniors? It's a 
junior level course. Okay. But it's taken by

23:34.845 --> 23:39.100
anything from sophomores to graduate students. 
And probably most of those, most of the years I've

23:39.180 --> 23:47.160
taught it, it's been maybe more juniors than 
anything else. But next to that, seniors. And it

23:49.240 --> 23:56.160
almost ranged all the way from, I guess, when I 
first started, around 100 students a semester.

23:56.240 --> 24:00.160
We've always taught it fall, spring, and summer. I 
have not. I've not missed since,

24:01.140 --> 24:15.280
well, since the summer of 69, I've not missed a 
summer, fall, or spring to teach that course. Now,

24:15.360 --> 24:21.280
when enrollment, the enrollment went as high as 
426. And I had them all that semester. Shortly

24:24.960 --> 24:27.880
thereafter, we were able to add some faculty. So 
there have been a couple of other people who have

24:27.960 --> 24:32.880
taught the course. And this is the basic course for 
anyone majoring in soil and crop sciences. And

24:39.860 --> 24:40.781
what else? It's been a required course. Of course, 
it's required for all the students that are a

24:41.860 --> 24:44.780
major. But it's been a required course in many 
other disciplines over the years. Not as many

24:49.860 --> 24:51.780
today as in the past. But when I came here, it was 
required for all students in animal science,

24:51.860 --> 25:00.780
recreation parks, horticulture,

25:00.760 --> 25:07.680
agricultural education, range land ecology and 
management. It would have been range science back

25:07.760 --> 25:10.680
then. Plant science is strongly recommended in a 
couple of areas in ag economics. Wildlife and

25:18.330 --> 25:23.250
fisheries required in part of their programs. 
Always had some students from geology. Some study

25:27.380 --> 25:31.300
in earth science for teaching purposes. No 
engineers, no M.E.s. No agricultural

25:35.380 --> 25:38.300
engineering was required in ag engineering. Oh, 
okay. What were, as you started out in that course,

25:40.987 --> 25:53.660
what were your private guidelines for how you were 
hoping to do the course? For you as a teacher, what

25:53.740 --> 26:02.190
was your philosophy?

26:02.270 --> 26:06.190
I really don't know all the things that shaped how I 
put the course together. I suppose you could say I

26:06.170 --> 26:13.090
was strongly influenced by what I found at Cornell 
when I began teaching there. The textbook used for

26:13.170 --> 26:20.090
the course there was, at that time, called Buckman 
and Brady. It goes back into, the textbook is now in

26:20.170 --> 26:26.660
its 12th edition, I believe. It goes back into the 
1920s, probably. And Dr. Brady was the department

26:31.950 --> 26:35.890
head, actually. He moved to the department head 
when I became a member of the faculty. But we

26:39.870 --> 26:43.790
alternated teaching that course there. One 
fellow taught it in the fall. I taught it in the

26:45.870 --> 26:47.790
spring. And then we alternated in the summer to 
teach it. And this fellow had more experience with

26:50.870 --> 26:55.790
that course than I did. But we met together every 
summer and went over the content of the

26:55.870 --> 27:02.790
laboratory. He has a laboratory with him. So he, in 
effect, re-did the laboratory exercises every

27:04.770 --> 27:08.690
summer. And so I had a chance to make inputs into 
those. So I guess the content was pretty much

27:11.770 --> 27:15.690
shaped to that. Although the fellow that I took 
introductory soils from at Texas A&M was a man

27:15.770 --> 27:22.940
named Hank Foth. F-O-T-H. F-O-T-H. He was only at 
Texas A&M three years when he went to Michigan

27:26.430 --> 27:35.560
State, which I believe was his alma mater. He spent 
the rest of his career there. He gave, I thought he

27:37.540 --> 27:41.490
was an excellent teacher. Subsequently, I think, 
Michigan State proved that. He wrote a textbook as

27:44.570 --> 27:46.490
well. His textbook, I got a lot of ideas from. But it 
was not nearly as old, meaty is probably the right

27:51.010 --> 28:02.200
term, as the one that we had at Cornell. So I used, 
but I took ideas from it. And that's how we

28:07.380 --> 28:10.220
developed the course. And I would say that it's 
not, as far as the organization and topics

28:10.300 --> 28:20.220
treated, it's not changed substantially over the 
years. With the big emphasis on behavioral

28:20.300 --> 28:30.220
objectives or instructional objectives, it was 
beginning to be a big deal in the late 60s and early

28:20.300 --> 28:30.220
70s. I totally did instructional objectives, 
which I had not done before. Somewhere

28:34.300 --> 28:37.850
early on. And I, do you know, right now, I'm not at 
all sure whether I started doing it at Cornell or

28:37.930 --> 28:43.750
not. But I think maybe I did. Remember, I was on the 
faculty there from 1963 to 1968. It was during a

28:52.080 --> 29:02.280
period, Vietnam, during a period where I think 
faculty became very hesitant to say anything

28:52.080 --> 29:02.280
controversial to students. You weren't supposed 
to. I,

29:04.360 --> 29:09.600
I'm not, and I'm not honestly not sure. I'm not sure 
when I started doing it. But I started early on to

29:11.680 --> 29:17.600
think that in addition to trying to teach subject 
matter, cognitive and subject matter, the

29:17.680 --> 29:28.140
faculty member had about as much responsibility 
to try to be a witness to life, philosophize a

29:17.680 --> 29:28.140
little bit about life and what it's all about. So I 
would always editorialize. And when I started

29:32.220 --> 29:35.140
doing this, I'm not sure, but I did it at Cornell. I 
know the idea for doing it was developed there, and

29:35.220 --> 29:40.140
I think I probably did. So I always tell my classes 
the first five minutes are mine. We talk about

29:44.220 --> 29:46.140
whatever we want to. You know, this semester I've 
already talked about bonfire. I've talked about

29:51.220 --> 29:54.140
credit cards and their use. I've talked about 
alcohol. I've talked about silver tabs being an

29:57.220 --> 30:05.480
important tradition, urging to participate. 
I've talked about being environmentally aware.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.140
Take trash out of the classroom. Close doors 
behind you when you go in and out of bed. So I've done

30:17.660 --> 30:19.580
that kind of thing. All, all. Yeah, and I have a, I 
have a final editorial that runs about 25 minutes,

30:20.605 --> 30:26.580
which is, that's the only time that I make any overt 
statement about being a Christian, but I do in that

30:26.660 --> 30:34.580
final 25 minutes of class. What's been the 
reaction, you think, over the years? I don't have

30:38.560 --> 30:44.720
any comments about the editorials on the course 
critique questionnaire and anything else. I

30:44.800 --> 30:49.720
guess we'll get somewhere between two and five 
comments in the vein of, I'll pay my money to take

30:49.800 --> 30:56.350
soil science, I don't care to hear your 
philosophy. I've never been bothered by those

30:56.430 --> 31:02.350
because I feel like at least once or twice I've 
pricked them in a pretty sensitive spot. Did you

31:02.430 --> 31:08.350
have, in all of your teaching, did you have any role 
models that affected the way you did it? Probably

31:12.900 --> 31:14.820
my mother and dad. Okay. Bigger role models than 
anybody. I come from a family of teachers. My

31:24.020 --> 31:25.940
mother was a teacher. Her sisters were teachers. 
Her brother was a teacher. So there were four of

31:30.020 --> 31:31.940
them. They were all teachers.
