00:02.849 --> 00:04.735
One, two, three, four, testing. Murray, now you 
say something. Hello, hello, I'm here. This

00:08.287 --> 00:16.234
is September the 12th, and I have the pleasure and 
honor of chatting.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.641
postdoctoral role while I joined the faculty at 
Cornell. Dr. Morris Bloodworth, who was head of

03:23.324 --> 03:40.091
the department at Texas A&M during those years and 
who had served on my master's committee, had told

03:23.324 --> 03:40.091
me at many professional meetings that it was just a 
matter of time until he would recruit me back to

03:23.324 --> 03:40.091
Texas A&M for faculty. So after I'd been at Cornell 
five years, Dr. Bloodworth came along with a

03:44.941 --> 03:48.085
faculty offer. By that time, I'd developed quite a 
good feel for Cornell. Really was uncertain about

03:52.591 --> 04:00.861
whether I would be granted tenure there or not, and 
knew if I was not going to receive tenure, a

03:52.591 --> 04:00.861
decision would be a very easy one. But

04:01.762 --> 04:14.458
if I did receive tenure, I actually served on the 
Cornell faculty as an associate professor for two

04:01.762 --> 04:14.458
months back to Texas A&M. That was probably the 
hardest professional decision I've ever made.

04:19.817 --> 04:25.933
You can look back even to this day and wonder, I 
guess, in some respects, whether it was the right

04:19.817 --> 04:25.933
decision or not. Well, a lot of things played into 
it. We were about 1,800 miles from my family, and we

04:28.960 --> 04:36.888
were 1,000 miles from my wife's family, and they 
were 1,000 miles apart. And that made any kind of,

04:37.990 --> 04:45.878
well, it took all the vacation that we had in the 
summer in those days with young children. We'd

04:47.680 --> 04:51.724
spend three weeks vacation, and we'd spend about 
half of it on the road. And so that was a strong

04:52.825 --> 04:55.228
motivator. motivating factor. I did not know 
whether my wife, who was a native of Wisconsin,

04:56.961 --> 05:02.535
whom I met during my PhD years,

09:18.627 --> 09:26.805
more familiar with the soils in the state, and to 
interact with Dr. Dixon, who preceded me here by

09:18.627 --> 09:26.805
about two months. So we had the same kinds of 
research interests. Well, it really developed a

09:32.297 --> 09:35.404
bunch.

09:49.964 --> 10:17.310
Carthage

09:49.964 --> 10:17.310
and then Chambers County. I remember down on the 
Gulf Coast. And those were all one week stays and

10:19.462 --> 10:24.608
seen very extensively. Those would come during 
what we call a final field review for the survey of

10:24.648 --> 10:31.036
those counties, the soil survey. So you go to all 
the parts of the county and you see the major kinds

10:31.697 --> 10:44.693
of soils that occur in that environment and 
discuss all of the different controversies about

10:31.697 --> 10:44.693
how to classify them and their uses and 
limitations and that kind of thing. That was an

10:44.858 --> 10:51.964
extremely fortunate to have that luxury in time, I 
suppose you'd say, in the first year. But to this

10:53.486 --> 11:02.694
day, I use a lot of slides in teaching the 
introductory soils course that I got in that first

10:53.486 --> 11:02.694
nine months I was here. And not to mention just the 
knowledge and appreciation for the variety of

11:03.535 --> 11:10.521
soils in the state. What else did you learn about 
the people of Texas and their variety? from those

11:15.335 --> 11:16.637
weeks? I don't know if, of course I grew up in Texas 
and since I went to A&M I guess you can say I had

11:17.338 --> 11:26.554
classmates from all parts of the state. One of the 
things when I first began teaching that truly

11:28.758 --> 11:40.077
shocked me was the variety in terms of origin of 
surnames of students I had in class in Texas as

11:28.758 --> 11:40.077
compared to New York State. If you'd asked me 
offhand, I would have said there would have been a

11:40.225 --> 11:51.385
lot greater cultural diversity in the student 
body at Cornell University than there would be at

11:40.225 --> 11:51.385
Texas A&M. That's not the case. There's a much, I 
immediately encountered so many different from

11:59.277 --> 12:07.484
all over Eastern Europe and Germany, and not to 
mention the Hispanic influence here as compared

11:59.277 --> 12:07.484
to New York. So about the only thing you could say at 
Cornell, in contrast, would be a much greater

12:07.584 --> 12:19.515
Jewish presence among the students at Cornell 
than here. I didn't recognize at that time. I

12:23.418 --> 12:26.461
wouldn't have recognized a Jewish surname from 
any other name. But I had a lab technician who was

12:26.481 --> 12:28.963
quite good at it. and had some prejudices, so he 
didn't hesitate to express his feelings about

12:29.467 --> 12:37.637
some. Incidentally, the Jewish students at 
Cornell were outstanding students in the

12:38.659 --> 12:44.586
classroom, exceptional students. Describe your 
getting settled into the department. Where was

12:49.392 --> 12:56.782
it, about how many people, who were the key leaders 
of the department in 1968? 1968.

13:00.162 --> 13:11.034
Marsh Bloodworth became head in 1963 and 
continued in that role until 1979, so he was

13:00.162 --> 13:11.034
obviously the kingpin in the department at that 
time. Actually, the department probably had more

13:12.295 --> 13:16.139
graduate students at that time than it has today. 
The faculty was not as large, although Dr.

13:16.159 --> 13:29.494
Bloodworth hired his first faculty member, I 
believe, in 1964 or 5. And in 1968, counting

13:30.385 --> 13:40.425
faculty here and off campus, I believe there were 
five or six employees in that year alone. And then

13:41.767 --> 13:51.246
continuing through the mid-70s, there was 
considerable addition to the faculty in terms of

13:41.767 --> 13:51.246
breadth of expertise. in soil science as well as 
other disciplines. So that was a period, well, a

13:54.916 --> 14:02.686
period for the entire university, but it was a 
period of very rapid growth for the department.

14:02.906 --> 14:05.169
And I think that was primarily his leadership. I 
think almost anybody even today here would tell

14:05.249 --> 14:20.288
you that Morris Bloodworth, and as I mentioned, 
O.D., and maybe Perry, they got the lion's share of

14:05.249 --> 14:20.288
the increases that were enjoyed during those 
early years. George Kunze had already moved to the

14:20.572 --> 14:25.659
graduate college when I got here. Jack Rockles was 
soon to become director of Water Resources

14:26.199 --> 14:30.665
Institute. So Jack would have been a leader, but 
gosh, there were a number of other faculty

14:32.007 --> 14:37.655
members. About how many total in the department?

14:43.201 --> 14:52.115
On campus, probably, and this is a wild guess, I 
don't know, probably 30, I'm guessing. What do you

14:53.137 --> 14:57.123
think the national reputation of the department 
was then? Not very good. I think you can generally

14:58.806 --> 15:08.281
say that for most, but by that time, by that time, 
recognized as an up-and-coming place. Because

15:09.183 --> 15:10.525
we'd already been, But at that time, just 
beginning to see really the takeoff that stemmed

15:10.927 --> 15:23.488
from all of those decisions that Dr. Rutter was 
instrumental in making and bringing to fruition.

15:24.190 --> 15:33.205
So the enrollment was definitely on the upswing, 
beginning to hire faculty, having a lot of

15:24.190 --> 15:33.205
retirements of some some people who had done, had 
performed yeoman service, but of an entirely

15:33.387 --> 15:44.532
different type than faculty to give you any kind of 
national presence would give. Where were y'all

15:44.713 --> 15:47.920
located and what were your facilities? here on 
campus? Well, the department's always been in

15:49.979 --> 15:52.624
several buildings. As large as facilities we have 
now, you'd think we'd be all be in one building, but

15:53.004 --> 15:57.471
we are. At that time, I was housed in the what is now 
the Butler Building. It was known then as the

16:02.659 --> 16:13.136
Grumman Building, and the building next to it we 
referred to as the old red brick building, and most

16:02.659 --> 16:13.136
of the soils faculty were in that building. Now 
that's never housed. That's over near the system

16:16.283 --> 16:25.837
Yeah, the Butler building is kind of across from 
the old physics building and the trigon, the

16:16.283 --> 16:25.837
military science building. The one with the big 
columns in front, you look in that area, you look

16:26.058 --> 16:32.127
right into the gravity building. And the old red 
brick building, it's no longer red, but it still

16:32.147 --> 16:42.342
stands, was immediately next to that one on the 
northwest, I guess you'd say. So it would be, in a

16:43.098 --> 16:49.604
sense, further up the street toward the Cushing 
Library at that time. So we occupied primarily

16:49.624 --> 16:53.228
those two buildings. Shared the State Chemist at 
that time. It was in the old Red Vic building. In

16:57.592 --> 17:00.475
fact, it was called the State Chemist building. 
But a lot of the soil is back in there. It was a

17:02.617 --> 17:05.400
dungeon. No air conditioning, no central air in 
any of those buildings at that time. All window air

17:10.725 --> 17:12.767
conditioning. Where were the labs that you and 
other and your colleagues used for your

17:13.034 --> 17:17.598
instruction? Well, the lab that I used was on the 
first, in the kind of basement, half basement in

17:17.779 --> 17:26.347
the old agronomy building. I mean, it had windows, 
but it was mostly below ground, half and half.

17:34.015 --> 17:41.522
The man who had been teaching in that position had, 
well, it really wasn't his first love. He taught a

17:41.705 --> 17:44.348
senior level course before teaching that. He was 
known for being reasonably cantankerous. And

17:49.836 --> 17:55.783
then there was a fellow that preceded him whose 
nickname was Whiskey Jack. Guys used to talk about

17:55.803 --> 18:00.549
finding him inebriated on lab benches. I would say 
that basic soils course, which is very important

18:00.569 --> 18:10.362
in the entire agricultural activity,

18:12.620 --> 18:37.429
it needed it needed some attention and the lab was 
oh it was in pitiful shape and and my predecessor

18:12.620 --> 18:37.429
was in it through the fall and spring of 1968-69 and 
my first teaching at Texas A&M was in the summer of

18:12.620 --> 18:37.429
1969 so I had I couldn't I didn't have any access to 
the facility until he was gone I think it's fair to

18:37.983 --> 18:42.428
say I've never worked harder in my life than I 
worked at Summit. As you, during that first year,

18:42.729 --> 18:51.439
what kind of advice did anyone give you about being 
a faculty member here or anything like that? Did

18:53.302 --> 18:56.285
anybody give you any guidelines or rules or? No, I 
don't remember being given a lot of advice. I guess

19:02.182 --> 19:13.478
I probably got as much advice from Dean Kunkle as 
anybody, although I didn't spend a lot of time with

19:02.182 --> 19:13.478
Dean Kunkle, but he was always philosophized with 
you a little bit. Dr. Potts, of course, was an

19:14.800 --> 19:27.358
institution at that time in the College of 
Agriculture, his associate dean, and

19:14.800 --> 19:27.358
I'll have to give him a lot of credit in this sense. 
In those first two or three years, He encouraged me

19:30.363 --> 19:51.126
to go to regional teaching workshops and anything 
that came up that I think he thought would be any

19:30.363 --> 19:51.126
kind of help or guidance in teaching, he was very 
eager to encourage you to take part in it. Dr.

19:52.006 --> 19:55.290
Bloodworth would always support him, but he'd 
never think about having somebody look for those

19:55.642 --> 20:00.029
kinds of opportunities, Dr. Potts did. And so he 
had a major role in getting me out to learn about

20:00.810 --> 20:10.985
developments in the technological aspect of the 
teaching at that time. And it was extremely

20:11.946 --> 20:13.589
supportive. Within the department,

20:14.510 --> 20:23.303
actually the man I followed had been the graduate 
advisor for the department. And in addition to

20:23.958 --> 20:28.875
teaching the undergraduate course, I almost 
inherited that role. And that meant almost from

20:28.895 --> 20:34.575
day one, while I didn't have graduate students 
myself other than some, well, I did have a few, but

20:34.808 --> 20:42.815
very few along. But basically, I interacted with 
all of the faculty in that role as graduate

20:42.835 --> 20:49.422
advisor. So I had a lot of opportunity to interact 
with other faculty members across a pretty, I mean

20:49.462 --> 21:01.693
our department represents a wide variety of 
disciplines. So I had an opportunity to interact

21:02.095 --> 21:07.083
with a lot of people that I wouldn't have 
otherwise. What was it, now you were a former

21:07.764 --> 21:20.965
student from this department, did that turn out to 
be an advantage, a disadvantage, or a mixed

21:07.764 --> 21:20.965
blessing as you were a young new faculty member? I 
was obviously advantaged in getting a job in the

21:21.248 --> 21:24.392
first place. I don't think it had anything to do. 
None of the veterans came in to talk down to you? No,

21:33.503 --> 21:36.566
no, I never, no. A lot of them, so many of us were at 
the same time. What did you and your colleagues

21:41.572 --> 21:46.378
think were the unspoken, unwritten guidelines 
about when you went to work, what you wore, how you

21:46.595 --> 21:52.163
did your job. What did you assume were the 
guidelines for you as a professional? Well, I

21:58.772 --> 22:13.092
expect most of us thought we ought to be at work at 8 
o'clock in the morning, we ought to stay there till

21:58.772 --> 22:13.092
5, and obviously all of us were 12-month 
employees, so we thought unless it was a holiday or

21:58.772 --> 22:13.092
we were on vacation, we should be there. Now his 
dress was,

22:13.342 --> 22:25.481
I think most of us always wore a tie when we were 
going to the classroom. But a lot of the work of

22:25.501 --> 22:31.430
faculty in the department has always been field 
oriented. So I think it's always been acceptable

22:31.450 --> 22:39.062
if you were not in the classroom to dress casually. 
And you're, beginning in 69, what were your, what

22:40.561 --> 22:50.015
were your responsibilities for courses and so 
forth in the early years? What courses were you to

22:50.455 --> 22:52.478
teach? Oh, well, you know, this is, but pretty much 
throughout my entire career, my major

22:52.959 --> 23:03.174
responsibility in teaching has been one course. 
It's been the introductory course in soil

23:03.194 --> 23:06.218
science. What number? Agronomy 301. Did it have a 
nickname? among the students? Well, I've heard it

23:12.686 --> 23:17.452
referred to as Murray Milford's Magical Mystery 
Hour. Some of the students went out one year and

23:17.472 --> 23:25.242
bought t-shirts and came back in with them on. They 
had Milford's clods on the back of their t-shirts.

23:29.627 --> 23:31.830
And this is normally to juniors? It's a junior 
level course, but it's taken by anything from

23:32.971 --> 23:39.019
sophomores to graduate students. And probably 
most of the years I've taught it, it's been maybe

23:39.623 --> 23:48.854
more juniors than anything else, but next to that, 
seniors. Enrollments ranged all the way from, I

23:49.675 --> 23:56.442
guess, when I first started, around 100 students a 
semester. We've always taught it fall, spring,

23:57.183 --> 24:01.068
and summer. I've not missed since...

24:07.484 --> 24:16.135
Well, since the summer of 69, I've not missed a 
summer, fall, or spring to teach that course. Now,

24:16.195 --> 24:20.781
the enrollment went as high as 426. And I had them 
all that semester. Shortly thereafter, we were

24:24.806 --> 24:27.650
able to add some faculty. So there have been a 
couple of other people who have taught the course.

24:33.033 --> 24:40.803
And this is the basic course for anyone majoring in 
soil and crop sciences, and what else? It's been a

24:40.823 --> 24:41.924
required course. Of course, it's required for all 
the students that are major, but it's been a

24:42.205 --> 24:51.577
required course in many other disciplines over 
the years, not as many today as in the past. But when

24:52.438 --> 25:02.230
I came here, it was required for all students in 
animal science, recreation, parks,

25:02.581 --> 25:10.072
horticulture, agricultural education, range 
land ecology management, would have been range

25:02.581 --> 25:10.072
science back then. Plant sciences, strongly 
recommended in a couple of areas in ag economics,

25:12.135 --> 25:23.011
wildlife and fisheries required in part of their 
programs. Always had some students from geology,

25:24.033 --> 25:31.744
some study in earth science for teaching 
purposes. No engineers, no M.E.s? No

25:35.430 --> 25:42.020
agricultural engineering, it was required by 
agricultural engineers, but none of the others.

25:42.040 --> 25:53.297
As you started out in that course, what were your 
private guidelines for how you were hoping to do

25:42.040 --> 25:53.297
the course? For you as a teacher, what was your 
philosophy?

26:01.120 --> 26:06.004
I really don't know all the things that shaped how I 
put the course together. I suppose you could say I

26:06.224 --> 26:13.090
was strongly influenced by what I found at Cornell 
when I began teaching there. The textbook used for

26:13.791 --> 26:19.856
the course there was, at that time, called Buckman 
and Brady. The textbook is now in its 12th edition,

26:20.317 --> 26:26.963
I believe. It goes back into the 1920s, probably. 
And Dr. Brady was the department head, actually.

26:36.506 --> 26:39.590
He moved to the department head when I became a 
member of the faculty. But we alternated teaching

26:40.010 --> 26:43.956
that course there. One fellow taught it in the 
fall, I taught it in the spring, and then we

26:44.877 --> 26:51.025
alternated in the summer to teach it. And this 
fellow had more experience with that course than I

26:52.047 --> 26:59.477
did, but we met together every summer and went over 
the content of the laboratory, and there's a

27:00.166 --> 27:04.132
laboratory with it. So we, in effect, redid the 
laboratory exercises every summer. And so I had a

27:08.719 --> 27:11.143
chance to make inputs into those. So I guess the 
content was pretty much shaped to that, although

27:11.163 --> 27:22.360
the fellow that I took introductory soils from at 
Texas A&M was a man named Hank Foth. F-O-T-H?

27:24.944 --> 27:25.465
F-O-T-H. He was only at Texas A&M three years when 
he went to Michigan State, which I believe was his

27:26.660 --> 27:36.770
alma mater, and he spent the rest of his career 
there. I thought he was an excellent teacher, and

27:37.750 --> 27:44.157
subsequently I think Michigan State proved that. 
He wrote a textbook as well. His textbook I got a lot

27:47.920 --> 27:54.186
of ideas from, but it was not nearly as oh, meaty's 
probably the right term, as the one that we had at

27:55.988 --> 28:02.980
Cornell. So I used, but I took ideas from it. And 
that's how we developed the course. And I would say

28:11.034 --> 28:20.730
it's not, as far as the organization and topics 
treated, it's not changed substantially over the

28:11.034 --> 28:20.730
years. with the big emphasis on behavioral 
objectives or instructional objectives that was

28:21.318 --> 28:29.907
beginning to be a big deal in the late 60s and early 
70s. I totally did instructional objectives,

28:31.129 --> 28:35.153
which I'd not done before for it. Somewhere early 
on, and do you know right now, I'm not at all sure

28:36.775 --> 28:45.744
whether I started doing it at Cornell or not, but I 
think maybe I did. Remember, I was on the faculty

28:46.405 --> 28:50.970
there from 1963 to 1968. It was during a period, 
Vietnam, during a period where I think faculty

28:52.115 --> 29:02.807
became very hesitant to say anything 
controversial to students. You weren't supposed

29:03.188 --> 29:04.169
to. I'm not, and I'm not honestly not sure when I 
started doing it, but I started early on to think

29:06.331 --> 29:21.328
that in addition to trying to teach subject 
matter, cognitive and subject matter, the

29:06.331 --> 29:21.328
faculty member had about as much responsibility 
to try to be a witness to life, philosophize a

29:22.658 --> 29:28.225
little bit about life and what it is all about. So I 
would always editorialize. And when I started

29:32.050 --> 29:35.195
doing this, I'm not sure, but I did it at Cornell. I 
know the idea for doing it was developed there, and

29:35.215 --> 29:38.779
I think it probably did. But so I always tell my 
classes, first five minutes are mine. We talk

29:44.447 --> 29:46.169
about whatever we want to. You know, this semester 
I've already talked about Bonfire. I've talked

29:51.464 --> 30:14.951
about credit cards and their use, talked about 
alcohol, talked about silver taps being an

29:51.464 --> 30:14.951
important tradition, urging to participate, 
talked about being environmentally aware, take

29:51.464 --> 30:14.951
trash out of the classroom, close doors behind you 
when you go in and out of bed. So I've done that kind

30:17.714 --> 30:20.998
of thing. Yeah, and I have a final editorial that 
runs about 25 minutes, which is, that's the only

30:21.215 --> 30:34.413
time that I make any overt statement about being a 
Christian, but I do in that final 25 minutes of

30:21.215 --> 30:34.413
class. And what's been the reaction, you think, 
over the years? More favorable comments about the

30:37.837 --> 30:44.045
editorials on the course critique questionnaire 
and anything else. I guess we'll get somewhere

30:44.065 --> 30:49.112
between two and five comments in the vein of I'll 
pay my money to take the soil, so I don't care to hear

30:49.750 --> 30:54.434
your philosophy. I've never been bothered by 
those because I feel like at least once I try, I've

30:55.896 --> 31:04.965
pricked them in a pretty sensitive spot. In all of 
your teaching, did you have any role models that

31:05.085 --> 31:12.632
affected the way you did it? Probably my mother and 
dad. Okay. bigger role models than anybody. I come

31:21.447 --> 31:22.971
from a family of teachers. My mother was a teacher. 
Her sisters were teachers. Her brother was a

31:27.543 --> 31:29.909
teacher. So there were four of them. They were all 
teachers.
