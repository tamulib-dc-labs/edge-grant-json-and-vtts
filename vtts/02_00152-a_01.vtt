00:02.410 --> 00:04.630
One, two, three, four, testing. Murray, now you 
say something. Hello, hello, I'm here.

00:11.640 --> 03:19.930
This

00:11.640 --> 03:19.930
is September the 12th, and I have the pleasure and 
honor of chatting with the postdoctoral role

03:19.910 --> 03:21.411
while I join the faculty at Cornell. Dr. Morris 
Bloodworth, who was head of the department at

03:22.930 --> 03:29.130
Texas A&M during those years and who had served on 
my master's committee, had told me at many

03:32.230 --> 03:36.550
professional meetings that it was just a matter of 
time until he would recruit me back to Texas A&M for

03:36.530 --> 03:39.950
faculty. So after I'd been at Cornell five years, 
Dr. Bloodworth came along with a faculty offer. By

03:47.970 --> 03:51.930
that time, I'd developed quite a good feel for 
Cornell. Really was uncertain about whether I

03:52.470 --> 03:56.130
would be granted tenure there or not and knew if I 
was not going to receive tenure, the decision

03:56.110 --> 04:00.850
would be a very easy one. But

04:01.730 --> 04:10.900
if I actually served on the Cornell faculty as an 
associate professor for two months, I'd have to go

04:10.900 --> 04:14.420
back to Texas A&M. That was probably the hardest 
professional decision I've ever made. You can

04:19.780 --> 04:23.760
look back even to this day and wonder, I guess, in 
some respects, whether it was the right decision

04:23.860 --> 04:25.600
or not. A lot of things played into it. We were about 
1,800 miles from my family, and we were 1,000 miles

04:32.840 --> 04:35.220
from my wife's family, and they were 1,000 miles 
apart. And that made any kind of, well, it took all

04:37.960 --> 04:42.780
the vacation. We had in the summer in those days 
with young children to, we'd spend three weeks

04:47.540 --> 04:51.720
vacation and we'd spend about half of it on the 
road. And so that was a strong motivating factor. I

04:56.800 --> 05:00.380
did not know whether my wife, who was a native of 
Wisconsin, whom I met during my Ph.D. years,

09:19.340 --> 09:21.320
more familiar with the soil than the state, and to 
interact with Dr. Dixon, who preceded me here by

09:21.680 --> 09:26.820
about two months. So we had the same kind... We had 
the same kinds of research interests. Well, it

09:32.250 --> 09:33.271
really...

10:15.490 --> 10:19.150
And then Chambers County, I remember down on the 
Gulf Coast, and those were all one-week stays and

10:19.570 --> 10:24.830
seen very extensively. Those would come during 
what we call a final field review for the survey of

10:28.430 --> 10:31.150
those counties, the soil survey. So you go to all 
the parts of the county and you see the major kinds

10:31.690 --> 10:35.990
of soils that occur in that environment and 
discuss all of the different controversies about

10:40.350 --> 10:41.371
how to classify them. And their uses and 
limitations and that kind of thing. That was an

10:44.790 --> 10:50.150
extremely fortunate to have that luxury and time, 
I suppose you'd say, in the first year. But to this

10:53.300 --> 10:58.400
day, I use a lot of slides in teaching the 
introductory soils course that I got in that first

10:58.500 --> 11:02.860
nine months I was here. And not to mention just the 
knowledge and appreciation for the variety of

11:07.640 --> 11:10.160
soils in the state. What else did you learn about 
the people of Texas and their variety from those

11:11.520 --> 11:16.960
weeks? Well, I don't know if... Of course, I grew up 
in Texas, and since I went to A&M, I guess you could

11:23.150 --> 11:26.850
say I'd had classmates from all parts of the state. 
One of the things when I first began teaching that

11:26.950 --> 11:32.430
truly shocked me was the variety in terms of origin 
of surnames of students I had in class in Texas as

11:36.370 --> 11:39.870
compared to New York State. If you'd asked me 
offhand, I would have said there would have been a

11:41.830 --> 11:46.330
lot greater cultural diversity in the student 
body at Cornell University than there would be at

11:46.430 --> 11:51.250
Texas A&M. That's not the case. There's a much... I 
immediately encountered so many different...

11:59.290 --> 12:03.450
From all over Eastern Europe and Germany and 
those... Not to mention the Hispanic influence

12:03.550 --> 12:07.450
here as compared to New York. So, about the only 
thing you could say... At Cornell, in contrast,

12:11.210 --> 12:17.430
would be a much greater Jewish presence among the 
students at Cornell than here. I didn't recognize

12:20.730 --> 12:23.230
at that time, I wouldn't have recognized a Jewish 
surname from any other name, but I had a lab

12:26.490 --> 12:29.430
technician who was quite good at it and had some 
prejudices, so he didn't hesitate to express his

12:31.530 --> 12:37.790
feelings about some. Incidentally, the Jewish 
students at Cornell were outstanding students,

12:41.670 --> 12:44.400
in the classroom, the exceptional students. 
Describe your getting settled into the

12:44.500 --> 12:49.300
department. Where was it, about how many people, 
who were the key leaders of the department in 1968?

12:58.440 --> 13:06.100
That became head in 1963 and continued in that role 
until 1979, so he was obviously the kingpin in the

13:06.200 --> 13:12.070
department at that time. Actually, the 
department probably had more graduate students

13:14.590 --> 13:17.230
at that time than it has today. The faculty was not 
as large, although it... Dr. Bloodworth hired his

13:23.460 --> 13:30.330
first faculty member, I believe, in 1964, or five. 
And in 1968, counting faculty here and off campus,

13:35.510 --> 13:41.540
I believe there were five or six employees in that 
year alone. And then continuing through the

13:41.640 --> 13:44.800
mid-'70s, there was... There was a considerable 
addition to the faculty in terms of breadth of

13:48.900 --> 13:54.820
expertise in soil science as well as other 
disciplines. So that was a period, well, a period

13:54.920 --> 13:58.240
for the entire university, but it was a period of 
very rapid growth for the department. And I think

14:02.580 --> 14:05.120
that was primarily his leadership. I think almost 
anybody, even today, here, would tell you that

14:08.540 --> 14:12.389
Morris Bloodworth and, as I mentioned, O.D. and 
maybe Perry, they've got the lion's share of the

14:15.560 --> 14:20.700
increases that were enjoyed during those early 
years. Was George Kunze, he had already moved to

14:20.800 --> 14:26.060
the graduate college when I got here. Jack Ruckles 
was soon to become director of Water Resources

14:26.160 --> 14:31.780
Institute. So Jack would have been a leader, but, 
gosh, there were a number of other faculty

14:31.880 --> 14:38.080
members. About how many total?

14:43.520 --> 14:48.200
On campus, probably, this is a wild guess. I don't, 
I don't know, probably 30, I'm guessing, 30. What

14:53.050 --> 14:57.870
do you think the national reputation of the 
department was then? Not very good. I think you can

15:00.040 --> 15:03.040
generally say that for most. But by that time, by 
that time, recognized as an up-and-coming place.

15:09.100 --> 15:17.800
Because we'd already, by that time, just 
beginning to see, really, the takeoff that

15:09.100 --> 15:17.800
stemmed from all those decisions that Dr. Rutter 
was instrumental in making and bringing to

15:17.780 --> 15:24.040
fruition. So the enrollment was definitely on the 
upswing, beginning to hire faculty, having a lot

15:31.160 --> 15:36.900
of retirements of some people who had done, had 
performed yeoman service, but of an entirely

15:37.000 --> 15:44.580
different type than faculty to give you any kind of 
national presence would give. Where were you all

15:44.680 --> 15:47.620
located and what were your facilities? Well, the 
department's always been in several buildings.

15:52.920 --> 15:57.780
As large a facility as we have now, you'd think we'd 
all be in one building, but we aren't. At that time,

15:57.880 --> 16:02.440
I was housed in the, what is now the Butler 
Building. It was known then as the Grumman

16:02.540 --> 16:05.040
Building. And the building next to it, we referred 
to as the old Red Brick Building, and most of the

16:10.260 --> 16:14.400
soils faculty were in that building, but I was 
never housed in that building. That's over near

16:14.500 --> 16:16.200
the system? Yeah, the Butler Building is the, is 
kind of across from the old Physics Building and

16:18.540 --> 16:25.960
the Trigon, the military science building. The 
one with the big columns in front, you look down at

16:26.060 --> 16:29.760
the MSD area, you look right into the Grumman 
Building, and the old Red Brick Building is no

16:29.860 --> 16:35.760
longer red, but it still stands, was immediately 
next to that one on the northwest side, so it would

16:43.710 --> 16:49.480
be in a sense further up the street toward the 
Cushing Library at that time. So we, we occupied

16:49.560 --> 16:53.660
primarily those two buildings. Shared the, the 
State Chemist at that time was in the old Red Brick

16:53.760 --> 16:57.500
Building. In fact, it was called the State Chemist 
Building, but a lot of the soils faculty were in

16:57.600 --> 17:02.100
there. It was a, it was a dungeon. No air 
conditioning, no central air in any of those

17:06.480 --> 17:10.480
buildings at that time. All window air 
conditioning. Where were the labs that you, you

17:13.170 --> 17:17.630
and other, and your colleagues used for your 
instruction? Well, the lab that I used was on the

17:17.730 --> 17:22.700
first, in the, kind of basement, half basement in 
the old agronomy building. I mean, it had windows,

17:26.300 --> 17:33.820
but it was mostly below ground, half and half. The, 
the man who had been teaching in that position had,

17:39.630 --> 17:41.650
well, it really wasn't his first love. He'd taught 
a senior level course before teaching that. He was

17:45.230 --> 17:50.450
known for being reasonably cantankerous. And 
then there was a, a fellow that preceded him whose

17:50.550 --> 17:54.810
nickname was Whiskey Jack. Guys used to talk about 
finding him inebriated on lab benches at times. I

18:00.290 --> 18:12.630
would say that, that basic soils course, which is 
very important in the entire agricultural

18:00.290 --> 18:12.630
activity,

18:12.730 --> 18:15.230
it needed, it needed some attention. And the lab 
was, oh, it was in pitiful shape. And, and my

18:18.930 --> 18:26.110
predecessor was in it through the fall and spring 
of 1968, 69, and my first teaching at Texas A&M was

18:26.090 --> 18:30.010
in the summer of 1969. So I had, I couldn't, I didn't 
have any access to the facility until he was gone. I

18:38.100 --> 18:42.000
think it's fair to say I've never worked harder in 
my life than I worked that summer. As, as you,

18:42.100 --> 18:53.160
during that first year, what kind of advice did 
anyone give you about being a faculty member here

18:42.100 --> 18:53.160
or anything like that? Did anybody give you any 
guidelines or rules or? No, I, you know, I don't

18:57.690 --> 19:01.450
remember being given a lot of advice. I, I guess I 
probably got as much advice, advice from Dean

19:01.550 --> 19:08.850
Kunkle as anybody, although I didn't spend a lot of 
time with Dean Kunkle. But, but he was always

19:08.950 --> 19:13.530
philosophized with you a little bit. Dr. Potts, of 
course, was an institution at that time in the

19:13.630 --> 19:27.730
College of Agriculture, his associate dean, and 
I'll have to give, I'll have to give him a lot of

19:13.630 --> 19:27.730
credit in this sense. But Dr. Potts was with Kunkle 
for those first two or three years, he encouraged

19:27.830 --> 19:42.820
me to go to regional teaching workshops and 
anything that, that came up that, that I think he

19:27.830 --> 19:42.820
thought would be any kind of help or guidance in 
teaching, he was, he was very eager to encourage

19:43.000 --> 19:51.840
you to take part in it. Dr. Bloodworth would always 
support him, but he would never think about having

19:51.960 --> 19:56.960
somebody. Yeah. for those kinds of 
opportunities, Dr. Potts did. And so he had a major

20:00.680 --> 20:05.460
role in getting me out to learn about developments 
in the technological aspect of the teaching at

20:09.540 --> 20:11.880
that time. And it was extremely supportive. 
Within the department,

20:14.460 --> 20:20.410
actually the man I followed had been the graduate 
advisor for the department. And in addition to

20:24.010 --> 20:26.830
teaching the undergraduate course, I almost 
inherited that role. And that meant almost from

20:28.890 --> 20:32.570
day one, while I didn't have graduate students 
myself, other than some, well, I did have a few, but

20:40.290 --> 20:41.591
very few along. But basically, I interacted with 
all of the faculty in that role as graduate

20:46.110 --> 20:49.430
advisor. So I had a lot of opportunity to interact 
with other faculty members across a pretty, our

20:58.870 --> 21:02.280
department represents a wide variety of 
disciplines. So I had an opportunity to interact

21:02.260 --> 21:05.340
with a lot of people that I wouldn't have 
otherwise. What was it, now you were a former

21:07.740 --> 21:10.740
student from this department, did that turn out to 
be an advantage, a disadvantage, or a mixed

21:16.080 --> 21:18.180
blessing as you were a young, new faculty member? 
It was obviously an advantage in getting a job in

21:22.920 --> 21:25.020
the first place. But none of it, I don't think it had 
anything to do with it. None of the veterans came in

21:28.760 --> 21:33.280
to talk down to you or anything? No, no, I know, no, I 
know. A lot of them, so many of us were at the same

21:36.570 --> 21:41.540
time. What did you and your colleagues think were 
the unspoken, unwritten guidelines about when

21:45.480 --> 21:49.660
you went to work, what you wore, how you did your 
job? What did you assume were the guidelines for

21:57.100 --> 21:58.161
you as a professional? Well, I expect, I expect 
most of us, thought we ought to be at work at eight

22:00.220 --> 22:02.460
o'clock in the morning, we ought to stay there till 
five, and obviously all of us were 12-month

22:04.280 --> 22:07.240
employees, so we felt unless it was a holiday or we 
were on vacation, we should be there. And how did

22:14.400 --> 22:15.261
you? Now, address was,

22:15.240 --> 22:21.100
I think most of us always wore a tie when we were 
going to the classroom. But a lot of the work of

22:25.460 --> 22:28.960
faculty in the department's always been 
field-oriented, so I think it's always been

22:33.440 --> 22:40.810
reasonable if you were not in the classroom to 
dress casually. And you're, beginning in 69, what

22:40.790 --> 22:45.330
were your, what were your responsibilities for 
courses and so forth in the early years? What

22:50.550 --> 22:53.170
courses were you to teach and? Oh, well, you know, 
this is, but pretty much throughout my entire

22:58.110 --> 23:01.270
career, my major responsibility in teaching has 
been one course. It's been the introduction. Oh.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.210
It's been the introductory course in soil 
science. What number? Agronomy 301. Did it have a

23:09.190 --> 23:12.580
nickname among the students? Well, I've heard it 
referred to as Murray Milford's Magical Mystery

23:15.440 --> 23:18.320
Hour at times, too. Okay, okay. And what's the? 
Some of the students went out one year and bought

23:22.440 --> 23:25.600
t-shirts and came back in with them on, had 
Milford's clods on the back of their t-shirts. And

23:29.180 --> 23:32.900
this is normally to juniors? It's a junior level 
course. Okay. But it's taken by anything from

23:34.846 --> 23:39.720
sophomores to graduate students. And probably 
most of those, most of the years I've taught it,

23:43.540 --> 23:47.500
it's been maybe more juniors than anything else, 
but next to that, seniors. And it almost ranged all

23:49.680 --> 23:53.220
the way from, I guess, when I first started, around 
100 students a semester. We've always taught it

23:57.160 --> 24:00.580
fall, spring, and summer. I have not, I have not 
missed since, you know, since,

24:04.270 --> 24:11.040
well, since the summer of 69, I've not missed a 
summer, fall, or spring to teach that course. Now,

24:16.140 --> 24:22.920
when enrollment, the enrollment went as high as 
426. And I had them all that semester. Shortly

24:24.700 --> 24:27.580
thereafter, we were able to add some faculty. So 
there have been a couple of other people who have

24:27.560 --> 24:33.120
taught the course. And this is the basic course for 
anyone majoring in soil and crop sciences, and

24:36.340 --> 24:40.740
what else? It's been a required course. It's, of 
course, it's required for all the students that

24:41.980 --> 24:44.860
are major. But it's been a required course in many 
other disciplines over the years. Not as many

24:49.640 --> 24:52.400
today as in the past. But when I came here, it was 
required for all students in animal science,

24:59.780 --> 25:06.240
recreation, parks, horticulture, agricultural 
education, rangeland ecology, management,

25:06.220 --> 25:12.060
would have been rangeland science back then. 
Plant science is strongly recommended in a couple

25:12.040 --> 25:19.190
of areas in ag economics, wildlife and fisheries 
required in part of their programs. Always had

25:24.310 --> 25:32.100
some students from geology, some study in earth 
science for teaching purposes. No, no engineers,

25:32.080 --> 25:35.420
no M.E.s, or? No agricultural engineering. It was 
required in ag engineering, but not, no, none of

25:36.840 --> 25:41.090
that. What were, as you started out in that course, 
what were your private guidelines for how you were

25:51.280 --> 25:53.240
hoping to do the course? What, for you as a teacher, 
what was your philosophy?

26:02.050 --> 26:06.130
I really don't know all the things that shaped how I 
put the course together. I suppose you could say I

26:06.110 --> 26:12.570
was strongly influenced by what I found at Cornell 
when I began teaching there. The textbook used for

26:13.797 --> 26:20.170
the course there was, at that time, called Buckman 
and Brady. It goes back into, the textbook is now in

26:20.150 --> 26:26.860
its 12th edition, I believe. It goes back into the 
1920s, probably.

26:32.410 --> 26:36.450
And Dr. Brady was the department head, actually. 
He moved to the department head when I became a

26:36.430 --> 26:39.970
member of the faculty. But there, we alternated 
teaching that course there. One fella taught it in

26:44.530 --> 26:49.930
the fall, I taught it in the spring, and then we 
alternated in the summer to teach it. And this

26:52.450 --> 26:58.890
fella had more experience with that course than I 
did, but we met together every summer and went over

26:58.870 --> 27:04.210
the content of the laboratory and has a laboratory 
with it. So we, in effect, re-did the laboratory

27:04.190 --> 27:08.890
exercises every summer. And so I had a chance to 
make inputs into those. I think it was a little

27:12.090 --> 27:13.111
different. I think it was a little different. I 
don't know the exact shape of that, although the

27:14.530 --> 27:18.960
fella that I took introductory soils from at Texas 
A&M was a man named Hank Foth. F-O-T-H? F-O-T-H. He

27:26.830 --> 27:34.000
was only at Texas A&M three years when he went to 
Michigan State, which I believe was his alma

27:33.980 --> 27:37.680
mater, and he spent the rest of his career there. He 
gave, I thought he was an excellent teacher and

27:37.660 --> 27:43.830
subsequently I think Michigan State proved that. 
wrote a textbook as well. His textbook I got a lot of

27:47.909 --> 27:52.290
ideas from, but it was not nearly as, oh meaty is 
probably the right term, as the one that we had at

28:01.700 --> 28:02.986
Cornell. So I used, I used, but I took ideas from it. 
And that's how we, we developed the course. And I

28:11.252 --> 28:14.520
would say it is not, it's not as far as the 
organization and topics treated. It's not

28:17.923 --> 28:20.480
changed substantially over the years. With the 
big emphasis on behavioral objectives or

28:20.460 --> 28:26.100
instructional objectives that was beginning to 
be a big deal in the late 60s and early 70s. I totally

28:31.154 --> 28:32.040
did instructional objectives, which I had not 
done before. Somewhere early on, and I, do you know

28:38.750 --> 28:43.310
right now, I'm not at all sure whether I started 
doing it at Cornell or not, but I think maybe I did.

28:46.110 --> 28:49.806
Remember, I was on the faculty there from 1963 to 
1968. It was during a period, Vietnam, during a

28:53.240 --> 28:59.160
period where I think faculty became very hesitant 
to say anything controversial to students. You

29:03.157 --> 29:04.161
weren't supposed to. I, I'm not, and I'm not, 
honestly not sure when I started doing it, but I

29:08.540 --> 29:13.420
started early on to think that in addition to 
trying to teach subject matter, cognitive and

29:13.400 --> 29:17.860
subject matter, the faculty member had about as 
much responsibility to try to be a witness to life,

29:23.420 --> 29:28.228
philosophize a little bit about life, and what it 
is all about. So, I would always editorialize. And

29:32.056 --> 29:34.700
when I started doing this, I'm not sure, but I did it 
at Cornell. I know the idea for doing it was

29:35.203 --> 29:38.804
developed there, and I think I probably did. But, 
so I always tell my classes, first five minutes are

29:41.660 --> 29:44.379
mine. We talk about whatever we want to. You know, 
already talked about bonfire. I've talked about

29:51.743 --> 29:54.100
credit cards and their use. Talked about alcohol. 
Talked about silver taps being an important

30:00.020 --> 30:02.976
tradition. Urging to participate. Talked about 
being environmentally aware. Take trash out of

30:08.748 --> 30:11.968
the classroom. Close doors behind you when you go 
in and out of the classroom. So, I've

30:13.940 --> 30:19.400
done that kind of thing. All of it. Yeah. And I have a 
final editorial that runs about 25 minutes, which

30:21.846 --> 30:32.060
is, that's the only time that I make any overt 
statement about being a Christian, but I do. In

30:32.040 --> 30:34.060
that final 25 minutes of class. And what's been the 
reaction, you think, over the years? More

30:38.040 --> 30:42.060
favorable comments about the editorials on the 
Course Critique Questionnaire and anything

30:38.040 --> 30:42.060
else. We'll get somewhere between two and five 
comments in the vein of, I'll pay my money to take

30:51.100 --> 30:54.432
soil science, I don't care to hear your 
philosophy. I've never been bothered by those,

30:55.897 --> 30:59.750
because I feel like at least once a trust, I've 
picked them in a pretty sensitive spot. In all of

31:03.730 --> 31:13.320
your teaching, did you have any role models that 
affected the way you did it? Probably my mother and

31:13.300 --> 31:15.130
dad. Bigger role models than anybody. I come from a 
family of three. Mm-hmm. I come from a family of

31:21.556 --> 31:23.440
teachers. Mm-hmm. My mother was a teacher. Her 
sisters were teachers. Her brother was a teacher.

31:30.328 --> 31:31.532
So, there were four of them. They were all 
teachers.
