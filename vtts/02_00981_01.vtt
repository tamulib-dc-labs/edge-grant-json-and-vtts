This is an interview with Mr. Virgil Gay by Wanda 
Marison Masek in 1994 at the Northgate Parking

00:09.143 --> 00:21.505
Garage, 2nd floor, concerning black awareness in 
the 1960s and early 70s. In the interest of

00:21.526 --> 00:28.418
accumulating knowledge about this, I am going to 
donate this tape to Texane and Oral History

00:21.526 --> 00:28.418
Collection in the University Archives.

00:53.153 --> 00:55.456
I was born in what they call Third Ward area. At the 
time, the hospital was called Houston Negro

00:56.438 --> 01:02.367
Hospital. And it was a segregated hospital

01:02.487 --> 01:13.604
system, so there was a lot of other things going on 
in Houston in the 1950s. So. Where did you live in

01:13.804 --> 01:16.488
high school? Went to Edward Warden High School in 
Houston. It's south of Houston. I grew up, well, I

01:19.853 --> 01:21.135
should have said my first

01:26.768 --> 01:29.821
called Suburbia out there. But it was a wood kind of 
school.

01:59.810 --> 02:07.879
All of my formal education through high school was 
in a segregated setting. The only time I was ever

02:07.959 --> 02:16.608
really exposed to whites or around them was when 
you would go shopping like in a store or something

02:07.959 --> 02:16.608
downtown. They didn't have the proliferation of 
malls that they have now. But when you would go

02:19.691 --> 02:24.096
downtown to Foley's or somewhere like that, you 
know,

02:31.720 --> 02:39.812
My dad worked for Swift Meatpacking as a beef bar, 
but they both did other jobs. And so basically, you

02:40.954 --> 02:48.565
know, there was a situation where I wanted to be an 
architect.

03:22.531 --> 03:25.740
with the white students, football.

03:49.649 --> 03:54.837
and go to Prairie View after Howard, I elected to go 
to A&M. And besides my other school on the other end

03:54.857 --> 04:03.229
of the spectrum, the white end of the spectrum, was 
Southern Cal. It was definitely too expensive. I

04:05.152 --> 04:10.420
think back in 1969 when A&M was running about 
$1,000 a year, Southern Cal was already $4,000 a

04:05.152 --> 04:10.420
year. Wow. It had a big difference. It felt a big 
difference. It was about three times as much. What

04:14.346 --> 04:17.631
were your first impressions of Texas A&M? uh you 
know uh to be honest with you i was i've always was

04:18.539 --> 04:42.083
from the first time i saw the campus and and have 
always been impressed with the amount of

04:18.539 --> 04:42.083
facilities that they have here the amount of 
effort they put into having a university just

04:18.539 --> 04:42.083
amount of support so i was uh impressed i guess with

04:54.736 --> 05:07.612
Basically,

04:54.736 --> 05:07.612
as I remember it, I graduated undergraduate 
school with better than a 3.0. I think it was a 3.2.3

05:07.632 --> 05:10.216
or something like that. Better than MISC and 
whatever that is you get to make it with honors or

05:10.296 --> 05:15.082
whatever. But anyway, there were some rough 
spots, but overall, in order to have a 3.0 average,

05:15.102 --> 05:21.910
it was better than that. I had

05:28.351 --> 05:35.746
taught in high school that, you know, of course 
there was no girls going here, at least living on

05:28.351 --> 05:35.746
campus here. It was horny to not live on campus. So 
that reduced the number that were available to be

05:37.269 --> 05:46.187
on campus, because people wouldn't let the girls 
come and live in an apartment. But anyway, and you

05:46.207 --> 05:49.313
know, we were always told, I said all that

06:02.590 --> 06:03.451
and do all that stuff. Well, what I quickly found 
out was one of those what I call the great

06:04.113 --> 06:10.984
equalizers in life. You always wind up, if you go in 
and do your best, generally speaking, there may be

06:11.004 --> 06:16.814
some people that are smarter than you are. And 
definitely speaking, there probably will be some

06:16.834 --> 06:20.781
people that are not as smart as you are. And so, what 
you learn real quickly

06:58.615 --> 07:12.924
the only real regret that I have of not staying in 
the Corps was the band. I was a very serious

08:13.827 --> 08:20.120
classes started, I was probably in uniform a full 
two days, maybe, before I was out. The court was

08:20.701 --> 08:22.284
interesting. I liked a lot of things that went on, 
but to be honest with you, having never gone to

08:22.404 --> 08:35.110
school once before, never been in a situation, 
having been told these guys are going to be real

08:22.404 --> 08:35.110
smart, I wanted to make sure that I didn't

09:30.085 --> 09:35.708
You know, a lot of times you have to realize being 
brought up

10:00.528 --> 10:06.155
So the communities were a lot safer and all that. 
And you really didn't get into the sting of racism

10:06.175 --> 10:16.727
until you got outside of your community, you know, 
for the most part. You went to school, all your

10:16.747 --> 10:18.329
teachers were black. They were positive role 
models for you. You know, they encouraged you to go

10:19.390 --> 10:21.773
to college. You know, you went to church. You know, 
it was all...

10:32.877 --> 10:53.063
when you went outside uh i did uh encounter a couple 
things one i remember once when we were traveling i

10:32.877 --> 10:53.063
was a teenager and we were going to washington d.c 
on vacation and i believe it was mississippi we

10:32.877 --> 10:53.063
stopped in to get some gas this had to be about 1967

10:57.532 --> 11:02.099
And at that time, I'll never forget it. It was an 
Exxon station. I think they call them Esso or Enco

11:03.841 --> 11:07.927
or something then. Humble, whatever. At the time, 
they were putting gas in the car. My mother jumped

11:12.714 --> 11:17.380
out of the car and went off to a water fountain and 
started taking a drink. And the guy that owned that

11:17.400 --> 11:24.771
station just, you know, he didn't go berserk after 
my mom, but he like, boy, he like in a hurry got over

11:17.400 --> 11:24.771
there and said, well,

11:41.879 --> 11:44.403
He motioned, my dad motioned to my mom, the kid in 
the car. And we both, you know, we got in the car. I

11:46.947 --> 11:47.688
never got out of the car. They got in the car. 
Proceed to tell her that's why we brought water.

11:51.534 --> 11:54.158
Because, you know, hundreds of people are. And, 
you know, you have memories like that. I remember

11:56.882 --> 12:00.507
stopping somewhere in Tennessee at a hamburger 
stand. They didn't have the McDonald's and these

12:00.527 --> 12:04.333
other places. And they parked one night because we 
were hungry. And, you know, you had, in front of the

12:08.322 --> 12:12.447
hamburger stand, these were walk-up windows. 
They had white on the other side to color. And so to

12:15.111 --> 12:26.825
sit there in a car and watch your dad go up to the 
color side and buy some hamburgers and come back

12:15.111 --> 12:26.825
and eat and go, you know, kind of thing. So, you 
know, you knew it was there, although it really

12:26.885 --> 12:32.432
didn't necessarily affect you right where you 
lived. One incident that was particularly ugly, I

12:32.553 --> 12:36.878
thought, because it was adults involved and what I 
call children involved.

13:02.575 --> 13:14.529
show stuff, kind of like our band director, I 
think, really liked Florida Anaheim's band and

13:02.575 --> 13:14.529
used to do a lot of stuff like that in the Grambling. 
So we would try to mimic some of the things that they

13:14.549 --> 13:18.113
would do. And so we got invited to the March 1 
Houston Ola games, you know, preseason games. And

13:20.676 --> 13:24.600
they still do the kind of thing they have on some of 
the preseason games. They have a high school band

13:24.620 --> 13:27.244
that performs. Well, anyway, to make a long story 
short, when we were in Riverside Stadium,

13:34.840 --> 13:45.729
there were some patrons, mostly adults, I don't 
remember seeing any children, that were throwing

13:34.840 --> 13:45.729
things and saying, ah, niggas this, and niggas 
that, you know. And, I don't know, when you look

13:46.511 --> 13:48.597
back on it as an

14:26.866 --> 14:36.340
you any discrimination here attending class or 
from a professor personally? Actually when I got

14:38.443 --> 14:48.017
here A&M I think was trying to be fairly good 
citizens about the whole thing. Students had only

14:48.037 --> 14:50.140
been here since about like

15:10.960 --> 15:16.351
He used it as a text and it was about slavery time and 
all that. The whole premise of this author's book

15:17.093 --> 15:26.051
was that blacks were better off and happier doing 
slavery time and all this kind of business. And it

15:26.833 --> 15:27.855
was rather obnoxious.

15:56.320 --> 16:10.701
challenged

15:56.320 --> 16:10.701
him on it and made him basically apologize to me in 
front of the class, to me and another student

15:56.320 --> 16:10.701
actually, in front of the class the next time we had 
class. And I was, you know, I was nice about it. I

16:12.684 --> 16:22.138
waited until after class and just, the way I did it, 
brother, I just told him that, you know, I noticed

16:12.684 --> 16:22.138
this was open architecture. You know, I just told 
him I was really disappointed in him for saying

16:22.159 --> 16:24.522
something like that.

16:40.027 --> 16:41.566
They didn't have...

17:08.444 --> 17:10.926
programming issues. So that's why we chose the 
name, because we were making people aware of, you

17:11.026 --> 17:20.656
know, blackness. You know, what it was like to be 
black, and so we took it as an alternative. Prior to

17:26.541 --> 17:30.525
that, we would meet off campus, you know, the black 
students would. So, I was fortunate. I think I was

17:33.048 --> 17:35.430
in a decent major in architecture, all the way up

18:29.933 --> 18:30.920
on building issues. You know, if there was 
something that needed to be done

19:39.307 --> 19:47.077
There was an opportunity in American history 
during Reconstruction that a lot of this could

19:39.307 --> 19:47.077
have been nipped in the bud. But then the federal 
government had a decision that basically ushered

19:47.137 --> 19:54.065
in the area of Jim Crowism. And then once they did 
that, then whites tried to turn back the clock. And

19:58.992 --> 20:00.994
they were allowed to do that for a while.

20:53.742 --> 20:58.116
I'm not sure how we knew that he was there, but I 
think that a couple of times

22:27.736 --> 22:33.342
Well, really, black power is, in essence,

23:18.158 --> 23:24.247
so that

23:18.158 --> 23:24.247
I can remember what it was like for me. But as long as 
you have racism,

23:47.335 --> 24:07.588
people see that you know there's some

23:47.335 --> 24:07.588
things that leads me again to another question 
with uh mexican americans hispanics um was there

23:47.335 --> 24:07.588
any binding or bonding done between african 
americans and mexican americans here i think

23:47.335 --> 24:07.588
generally speaking it was uh i wasn't really you 
know

24:45.773 --> 24:46.301
No.

25:50.590 --> 25:53.260
you sort of really put a lot of those people

26:27.968 --> 26:36.205
situation or do you want to deal with people who 
want to just burn a sucker and start over? But it

26:36.225 --> 26:36.766
works. To me, they both work together.

27:03.710 --> 27:05.805
Y'all ever meet some people down here?

27:36.211 --> 27:37.665
Yeah.

28:26.465 --> 28:27.498
1970.

29:45.794 --> 29:47.945
and all that kind of business. Confused about it 
for the most part, not really very sophisticated

29:47.965 --> 29:51.703
on it.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.343
They don't want it. He wants it to be
