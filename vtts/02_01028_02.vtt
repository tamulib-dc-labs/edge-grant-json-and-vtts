WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:05.327
Always coming out with optimistic. Right. What 
did you think about that? Did you share that? No, I

00:09.351 --> 00:12.253
think I just said that a minute ago. I was very 
disappointed because, well, initially, you

00:12.273 --> 00:19.080
know, the first tour for the first three or four 
months, you're pumped full of vinegar. But then

00:19.740 --> 00:23.084
you see my unit had been there since 1962. And you 
start getting guys back in or you talk to guys

00:24.805 --> 00:28.789
who's, been there, and they're saying, you know, 
we were doing the same damn thing in 62, for

00:29.123 --> 00:33.431
instance. Our battalion maintenance officer on 
my first tour, a good friend of mine, Tom Cooper,

00:34.332 --> 00:45.833
had first, as a pilot, took his first hit at Doc Tobe 
in 63. He came in with the company originally. Of

00:49.580 --> 00:51.343
course, he was coming back to that company. He 
liked that area, I guess. I don't know. And you

00:54.183 --> 01:00.090
think about it and you say, my God, you know, we're 
going back out and we're doing the same damn thing

00:54.183 --> 01:00.090
in the same area they did it before. Well, I started 
repeating that cycle after about three months.

01:02.552 --> 01:03.714
We're going into the same LZs. A lot of times after 
the same units. You get to thinking, well, this is

01:08.299 --> 01:10.241
bullshit. Find out where these suckers live and 
get them. And they lived across the border. They

01:15.006 --> 01:16.908
lived in Laos and Cambodia. And we would have raids 
over there. Those were special operations. I

01:21.753 --> 01:25.338
don't know what the status is on that. But we didn't 
go after them where they lived. And had we gone

01:30.406 --> 01:45.891
after them where they lived, not necessarily with 
ground troops, but with special troops, and with

01:30.406 --> 01:45.891
effective bombing, much like Nixon did later on, I 
think we would have put quite a strain on their

01:46.867 --> 01:51.872
logistics before they'd had a chance to build them 
up. What about all the times Westmoreland said,

01:51.892 --> 01:57.919
you know, he could see the light at the end of the 
tunnel? I thought it was bullshit. I thought it was

02:02.644 --> 02:05.547
bullshit then, and I'm not talking 20-20 
hindsight. I have letters that I've written to my

02:05.567 --> 02:07.108
wife. I've read you some of those letters. In 1967, 
I thought it was bullshit. That if we didn't

02:11.493 --> 02:16.198
change, we

02:11.493 --> 02:16.198
were... not going to win. And as a result, I became 
convinced we just need to hold on. I thought,

02:27.467 --> 02:35.898
surely they'll at least hold on until we get this 
thing stabilized to the point that the South can

02:27.467 --> 02:35.898
take care of itself.

02:44.670 --> 02:45.932
Next question. I mean, Westmoreland was basing 
his, you know, his claims on the body counts and all

02:47.077 --> 02:57.050
these, you know, all the information that he was 
getting. What about that information? I have one

03:01.376 --> 03:04.600
personal experience with that. There was a guy 
named Shriver at CAMDA. It was a special

03:07.424 --> 03:08.566
operation. We were working at the time, and he was 
leader of a reconnaissance team. And he was across

03:15.154 --> 03:16.476
the border. We put him in. I went to pick him up. And 
this was in late 67. And Shriver indicated, now I

03:26.607 --> 03:35.701
wasn't sitting in the room, but I was told this, 
that there were Chinese passing. And every time 10

03:38.004 --> 03:42.531
had passed, he would key the mic. He said he 
couldn't talk anymore, so he would just key the

03:42.551 --> 03:44.674
microphone. He keyed that microphone 90 times.

03:50.783 --> 03:57.411
Now, this area is Laos. It's probably 50 miles 
south of the North Vietnamese border that we're

03:57.431 --> 04:05.760
talking about, maybe 75 miles. I'm not sure. They 
just have to give them maps. That's been 20 years

04:07.923 --> 04:10.065
now. Anyway, we took this guy down to Saigon. He had 
to report to a brigadier general. who was in

04:15.417 --> 04:16.618
charge. And the Brigadier General told him he 
didn't see Chinese. He didn't see anybody type of

04:21.143 --> 04:23.925
thing. And old Shriver was not real political. He 
was an old Special Forces sergeant. He basically

04:27.409 --> 04:30.512
told him, General, I know Chinese when I see 
Chinese. And I counted 900 of them, you can believe

04:30.572 --> 04:35.236
it or not. And he was dismissed. And the 
intelligence officer said after

04:37.618 --> 04:44.445
Tet that said they had the same kind of thing. You 
know, we told them this was happening. We've told

04:49.101 --> 04:49.802
them this. Now, either somebody in Saigon wasn't 
counting,

04:50.883 --> 05:05.963
or somebody in Saigon was counting and not telling 
the general, or the damn general was ignoring the

04:50.883 --> 05:05.963
numbers, or Washington was ignoring the numbers, 
or all of the above. I don't know. I know it would

05:08.206 --> 05:12.492
have been hard put to convince me at Pleiku In 1967, 
when I watched the intensity go from minor

05:13.636 --> 05:38.683
problems in that area in January to major battles 
the size of the Saipan battles, I'm referring now

05:13.636 --> 05:38.683
to Dokto and places like that, major battles by the 
end of the year, that there was not a buildup in the

05:13.636 --> 05:38.683
infiltration. Because had the bastards been in 
there that thick earlier, we would have seen them.

05:42.847 --> 05:44.409
They had to be coming across the border.

05:53.357 --> 05:53.998
Turn the fan off. How old were you when you got to 
Vietnam? I was 26, almost 27. I

06:02.866 --> 06:11.875
was older, yes, and I was longer in service.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.341
than the draftee. I was about the same age as a lot of 
the regular line officers, but I was probably four

06:16.123 --> 06:25.192
years older than my contemporaries in the 
helicopter pilot area. We had a lot of guys that

06:25.933 --> 06:31.358
were 18 and 19, right at 19, I guess. We had a lot of 
them that were 20 and 21, so I was four or five years

06:33.801 --> 06:43.110
older than probably the average pilot in my area. 
But then again, I had been in the infantry and had

06:43.883 --> 06:49.191
other aviation experience. You think you were a 
little bit less susceptible than the younger guys

06:49.912 --> 06:54.478
there? Yes, I was. I was better trained, less 
susceptible. To all the rhetoric of the generals?

07:03.091 --> 07:03.872
I definitely do. Because I had developed a good 
healthy cynicism to

07:05.815 --> 07:12.304
political things. But I think also there were a lot 
of guys my age and older in the unit. And so we tried

07:21.640 --> 07:28.487
to

07:21.640 --> 07:28.487
pass on some of the cynicism to the younger troops. 
But it's amazing. 19-year-old kids have gone over

07:30.269 --> 07:32.671
the same area twice. 20-year-old kids have gone 
over the same area twice. They're pretty good.

07:35.514 --> 07:36.375
I'll give you an example. Cheerio. Young sergeant 
out of the 101st Airborne. We were helping them

07:40.199 --> 07:43.202
down there. I went cheerio. Yeah, I went cheerio. 
And he's got his knife out. And this sergeant

07:51.412 --> 07:54.236
looked to be about 20 years old. Fairly obvious 
draftee or young RA that had been there long enough

07:54.256 --> 08:01.284
to make sergeant. He's cutting the hair off his 
arm, shaving little spots of hair. And I says, what

08:05.729 --> 08:07.070
are you doing, sergeant? We were waiting. We were 
on five-minute alert to go make myself. He says,

08:09.794 --> 08:11.856
cutting LZs for mosquitoes, sir. And I said, why is 
that? He said, malaria gets you four weeks in the

08:16.574 --> 08:18.777
hospital.

08:21.660 --> 08:27.086
So pretty cynical approach to the thing, you know. 
I mean, he's been a brave man. He was a good leader,

08:28.407 --> 08:31.150
leading his squad and all of this. But if I go out 
being ill, I'm sure that his answer was just an

08:32.031 --> 08:36.436
answer. He was probably just checking his knife. 
They didn't trust anybody except their own

08:38.358 --> 08:42.703
friends.

08:46.143 --> 08:51.070
What effect did Tet have on morale?

08:51.090 --> 08:54.054
Militarily, it was actually because we knew we'd 
kick their ass. Now, I was back here, but I had

08:54.114 --> 08:56.317
friends that were coming back. But as we watched 
the political events of it unfold, what had been a

08:57.839 --> 09:08.633
military victory, I mean, they practically wiped 
out entire units of the enemy. We got over 800 of

09:10.436 --> 09:11.217
them. One of my friends had come back from... 
played coup. They killed over 800 of them on the end

09:15.302 --> 09:18.026
of our runway out there. We knew we had just 
decimated them. And the newspapers were turning

09:23.572 --> 09:26.596
it around. I mean, I was here watching it. And I 
would have thought they had overrun the American

09:29.199 --> 09:40.633
embassy and was holding the ambassador hostage 
from the way the damn news was jumping up and down

09:29.199 --> 09:40.633
and the way Washington was reacting and jumping 
through the butt. It turns out they had a sapper

09:40.653 --> 09:43.757
squad in there led by a young lieutenant. that 
basically turned into a suicide outfit that never

09:44.851 --> 09:48.899
even got in the door of the damn embassy. They blew a 
hole in the wall and got in the compound. I mean,

09:52.907 --> 09:54.189
it's the best they were able to do. But our own 
press... They weren't supposed to be able to get

09:58.217 --> 10:03.447
that far, even on the embassy grounds. Well, I 
would have challenged that. I challenge the

10:06.890 --> 10:11.875
military knowledge of the individuals making 
those decisions and the reporters reporting

10:06.890 --> 10:11.875
them. That's another reason to always be cynical 
of the press because you usually find that they're

10:11.895 --> 10:20.063
not that well educated, at least in the subjects 
that they try to write about. And they don't care

10:20.323 --> 10:25.268
too much about calling with experts that disagree 
with preconceived opinions. But three people

10:26.109 --> 10:30.273
were not supposed to be able to take 747s.

10:32.055 --> 10:36.019
Four people were not supposed to be able to take 
747s to the middle of the desert and blow them up.

10:37.332 --> 10:41.476
Five and six people are not supposed to be able to 
get in an embassy and hold the entire embassy. Half

10:43.418 --> 10:47.943
a dozen people are not supposed to be able to go in 
and blow something all to pieces. Well, special

10:49.404 --> 10:55.310
troops and people who are dedicated terrorists 
can do this sort of thing. And had the newspapers

10:58.093 --> 11:03.458
reported this as a group of special troops or 
commandos, who had gotten into the walls, but

11:05.294 --> 11:10.942
we've got them contained, the American public 
wouldn't have been half as shocked. But they may

11:11.363 --> 11:16.290
sound like, you know, they're coming out of the 
woodwork and coming through the floors and

11:11.363 --> 11:16.290
everything else. Not understanding, I mean, look 
at how panic-stricken the U.S. is and a lot of other

11:17.933 --> 11:23.942
countries are today over terrorism. They know 
that a few key, dedicated individuals can do a lot

11:26.225 --> 11:30.091
of things. And when you bring out 50,000 of them,

11:37.492 --> 11:41.416
and the few key dedicated individuals that are 
leading them, and you chop them to the knees. The

11:43.058 --> 11:55.792
strongest military defeat, yet our press and the 
North Vietnamese public relations were able to

11:43.058 --> 11:55.792
turn that into a great victory for the North. One of 
the things that's not generally publicized is one

11:56.933 --> 12:06.283
of the newspaper sources, and if your professor 
knows any newsmen, let him ask. One of the sources

12:06.618 --> 12:15.434
was a local Vietnamese reporter who was in the know 
on everything. And they would go to him for the true

12:16.897 --> 12:18.620
story. And to the point that I think it was either 
Time or Newsweek had this Nguyen, whatever his

12:20.284 --> 12:30.162
name was, listed on their masthead as the 
assistant head of the Saigon Bureau. Well, the day

12:31.441 --> 12:38.532
the country fell, the bastard was standing there 
in the uniform and markings of a colonel of

12:31.441 --> 12:38.532
intelligence, North Vietnamese regular army. 
They didn't trust their own sources, so they go to

12:40.736 --> 12:49.309
this great source and ask him to check on them. If he 
doesn't believe it, tell him to go back and get a

12:49.329 --> 12:57.702
1973, 74, or early 75 issue of those two magazines 
and start looking down. and find the Vietnamese

12:58.441 --> 13:05.051
assistant, and then tell him to ask Vietnamese who 
this man was. That would have been like Goebbels

13:07.775 --> 13:13.424
editing the New York Times in World War II. How do 
you think our victories would have looked then? I

13:17.991 --> 13:18.551
can imagine. All right, let's get back to you 
again. You were there for two and a half tours? Two

13:25.880 --> 13:27.482
tours plus two months. Two tours and two months. 
Why'd you finally, why'd you stay first of all?

13:33.768 --> 13:34.308
Why'd you go? Because I believed in what we were 
doing.

13:40.074 --> 13:49.162
I believed

13:40.074 --> 13:49.162
in, I grew up in the, I grew into my teens in the 50s.

13:52.185 --> 13:53.386
And I believed in my country. I mean, World War II I 
was five or six years old when it ended. Patriotism

13:58.342 --> 14:06.232
and belief in your country was very strong as I was 
growing up, doing things for your country. When

14:06.252 --> 14:15.604
our president stood up and said, ask not what the 
country can do for you, but what you can do for your

14:06.252 --> 14:15.604
country. Those were real words to me. I 
volunteered for a special unit, entered the

14:18.748 --> 14:22.272
service just shortly before that time. 
Volunteered for a special unit then. Because I

14:25.702 --> 14:31.228
felt that we had to stop the communists, stop them 
in Cuba. The unit that I was with was supposed to

14:32.089 --> 14:38.196
give air support at the Bay of Pigs. And that's the 
first time I got disillusioned when we were told

14:38.216 --> 14:44.583
that no air support, when the public was told no air 
support was promised. I was in the unit that was

14:45.684 --> 14:48.047
going to give the air support. And Jimmy Houck in 
Alexander, Louisiana, who's there today, was in

14:49.192 --> 14:54.641
the unit that was going to provide the air support.

14:59.229 --> 15:01.673
That's when I first began to distrust 
politicians. First began to question some of the

15:03.315 --> 15:05.619
decisions. Like I said, you get cynical pretty 
early. Go ahead with the next question. Anyway, I

15:14.053 --> 15:15.756
believed in what we were doing. And why did you 
decide to finally leave? Orders.

15:25.726 --> 15:27.989
So you were ordered out. The American Army drew 
down in Vietnam in 1973, with the exception of a

15:28.009 --> 15:42.587
few, very few, unit advisors assigned to the 
Vietnamese Army and unit advisors or instructors

15:28.009 --> 15:42.587
assigned to the Vietnamese Air Force.

15:45.891 --> 15:47.953
The country fell in 1975.

15:50.853 --> 16:01.494
They're probably, if you notice, the evacuation 
was for the most part evacuation of civilian and

15:50.853 --> 16:01.494
diplomatic personnel, not massive units. A lot of 
civilian personnel were over there maintaining

16:01.514 --> 16:03.999
aircraft. Bell had a bunch of people over there on 
contracts to the South End. A hell of a lot of

16:07.125 --> 16:09.469
civilians over there making money on contracts. 
Damn few military.

16:21.245 --> 16:45.092
doesn't alter the fact

16:21.245 --> 16:45.092
1973 they had the drawdown my last time there was 
1971 early 71 I was there for a Board of Inquiry at

16:21.245 --> 16:45.092
that time

16:21.245 --> 16:45.092
not anything related to something like Cali but 
the American press, I think I read you the letter

16:45.545 --> 16:51.191
about how disgusted I was over the Cali affair. I 
said that if this is true, that someone has made a

16:51.311 --> 17:02.943
terrible mistake in allowing such a man to become 
an officer in the United States Army, that this is

16:51.311 --> 17:02.943
Nazi Germany, not the American Army. I was very 
proud of the fact that it was a helicopter pilot

17:03.224 --> 17:11.232
that stopped the fight, stopped the slaughter, 
rather, that he took his guns off his door gunners

17:11.633 --> 17:39.835
and he told the American army lieutenant that if he 
didn't stop it he would kill him and the American

17:11.633 --> 17:39.835
army stopped the slaughter the American army 
lieutenant stopped the slaughter I'm very

17:11.633 --> 17:39.835
disappointed then that the army had the cover up 
I'm convinced that Cali didn't act on his own

17:11.633 --> 17:39.835
initiative without either benign neglect or 
quasi approval from above at least at the

17:11.633 --> 17:39.835
battalion if not the divisional level And I 
believe this because I know the control that

17:42.211 --> 17:51.268
American units were under in combat.

17:51.288 --> 17:59.444
For him to be able to go out and slaughter that 
village and no questions would be asked, he had to

17:51.288 --> 17:59.444
have known that no punishment would be 
forthcoming. We had a guy kill enemy soldiers one

18:01.067 --> 18:03.932
time.

18:08.401 --> 18:13.266
And he had been in combat a long time, but he decided 
he wanted that enemy soldier's skull for a candle

18:08.401 --> 18:13.266
holder. So every time somebody would come out to 
try to get that soldier to bury him, he would strafe

18:13.786 --> 18:19.551
him.

18:24.616 --> 18:28.199
And our commander threatened the court-martial. 
He didn't knock that bullshit off. For the most

18:30.742 --> 18:35.286
part, the commanders of the American Army over 
there were pretty damned honorable men, a lot more

18:35.992 --> 18:39.737
so than I've found in civilian life. They still 
believed in the ethics of your word as your bond.

18:46.767 --> 18:50.372
And an officer don't lie to another officer. An 
officer doesn't lie.

18:57.381 --> 19:01.487
So when you left, it was basically part of the 
withdrawal, phased out. Yeah. Nixon's policy.

19:04.466 --> 19:05.406
Right. Vietnamization. What did you think of that 
policy? Was there peace and honor? The policy as it

19:10.612 --> 19:16.478
was initially set up, we had spent several years 
training Vietnamese pilots. I can personally

19:16.858 --> 19:18.500
vouch for that. And some of them were pretty good. 
They weren't as good in some cases as we were

19:22.243 --> 19:32.914
because I don't believe they, well, first off, 
they didn't have the mechanical aptitude that a

19:22.243 --> 19:32.914
lot of our people had But they were pretty good 
pilots, and they were pretty dedicated young men.

19:38.781 --> 19:43.947
So I can vouch for the Vietnamization coming 
along. And we didn't give them a lot of offensive

19:43.967 --> 19:49.713
weapons, by the way. And by that offensive, I mean 
something capable of going north. They didn't

19:53.277 --> 19:54.358
have heavy bombers. They didn't have heavy 
fighters. They didn't have the legs on the little

19:57.662 --> 19:59.444
fire planes. They had to go more than a couple 
hundred miles.

20:04.484 --> 20:08.929
We set them up as a defensive anti-guerrilla army.

20:12.292 --> 20:16.937
And when those tanks came down, they didn't have 
anti-tank weapons. We hadn't given them

20:17.678 --> 20:19.860
anti-tank weapons. They didn't have anything out 
there really capable of stopping tanks, mainline

20:21.462 --> 20:28.129
Soviet tanks, which is what came down in 
five-division strength.

20:31.484 --> 20:39.735
If that happened, the contingency plan was the 
United States would come in and stop them, as we did

20:31.484 --> 20:39.735
in 72. We went in there with tow missiles and the 
anti-armor capability and stopped the armor

20:39.815 --> 20:46.383
invasion at Khantoum and Dokto. Yet when it 
happened the second time, our political will was

20:47.585 --> 20:53.993
destroyed. A lot of it was destroyed by a press 
that, in my opinion, was duped or had other

20:54.013 --> 21:01.002
motives. Now, he may say, hence sour grapes, but 
it's my opinion. And the South Vietnamese Army did

21:07.638 --> 21:11.062
not have anti-tank weapons. They didn't have 
anti-tank units. And when those armored

21:15.447 --> 21:20.593
divisions rolled south, they rolled up just like 
anybody else rolls up. Now, they could have

21:20.653 --> 21:26.280
stopped those tanks had they been suicidal. They 
could have stopped those tanks had they been

21:26.581 --> 21:33.971
suicidal and properly led, yes, because the North 
Vietnamese were suicidal in a lot of cases. They

21:35.593 --> 21:41.561
could have stopped those tanks with bodies 
leaping on them as the Hungarian stopped tanks.

21:41.581 --> 21:44.585
They couldn't have stopped them indefinitely. 
But when they wake up and see their senior

21:44.605 --> 21:56.200
French-trained officer corps beating feet, and 
they hear on the radios, and for the most part the

21:44.605 --> 21:56.200
young ones spoke pretty good English, And they had 
shortwave radios all over the place. And when they

21:58.454 --> 22:04.041
hear the United States saying, we're not coming in 
there, we're not going to do anything, who the hell

21:58.454 --> 22:04.041
expects them to stick around? Would you stick 
around?

22:08.146 --> 22:15.615
So Vietnamization worked as long as it stayed an 
anti-guerrilla, light infantry war. When it

22:17.197 --> 22:26.288
became an armored war, they folded up the northern 
part of the country in a matter of days. and then

22:27.567 --> 22:31.431
started south, and the rest of it fell of its own 
weight.

22:35.135 --> 22:43.665
So they turned things over to them, but didn't... 
Well, we didn't give them the anti-armor

22:35.135 --> 22:43.665
capability, and we didn't give them the air 
support when they needed it. Now, you asked me what

22:44.025 --> 22:49.872
I would consider a victory or something like that? 
Yeah, that's my next question. I thought you'd ask

22:51.013 --> 22:53.976
that. What would have constituted victory in 
Vietnam? A stabilized, democratic South

22:56.677 --> 22:58.820
Vietnam. And I don't mean necessarily a U.S. 
puppet or anything of that nature. A stabilized,

23:03.047 --> 23:08.797
democratic South Vietnam. Democracy, 
multi-party democracy. Socialism if they wanted

23:12.042 --> 23:13.324
it. Capitalism to whatever extent they desired 
it. Soviet client state is a total and absolute

23:18.573 --> 23:21.317
defeat.

23:26.798 --> 23:31.522
I hear when I said the Soviet client states an 
absolute total defeat. They now threaten the

23:31.542 --> 23:33.364
Philippines. One of the finest submarine bases in 
the Pacific for the Soviet fleet that outflanks

23:35.506 --> 23:45.194
our Japanese lines of communication is now Soviet 
owned. The aircraft sitting there threaten the

23:46.615 --> 23:54.642
Philippines and as you can see the Philippines are 
becoming unstable as a result of it. The biggest

23:57.494 --> 24:24.970
disgrace though is that we sat here for years when 
people were telling us what was going on the

23:57.494 --> 24:24.970
genocide that was occurring with the yellow rain 
and they say yellow rain is beefy that's a crock i

23:57.494 --> 24:24.970
have documents in my work yellow rain is not beefy 
it's a toxin uh

24:29.067 --> 24:58.939
to allow three million Cambodians, a million 
Laotians, and thousands and thousands of South

24:29.067 --> 24:58.939
Vietnamese to be murdered and not say a word, not go 
in and militarily destroy the people responsible

24:29.067 --> 24:58.939
or punish the people responsible. It's like 
chemical warfare because we kept our mouth shut

24:59.830 --> 25:05.255
over the Middle Eastern atrocities up until very 
recently. We allowed them to continue, and now

25:05.656 --> 25:13.563
we've got the chemical warfare genie out of the 
bag, and it's going full guns around the world.

25:13.663 --> 25:16.386
Well, the same thing happened with the genocide 
genie there. They made a little bit of yelling

25:17.387 --> 25:25.855
after China was lost, and millions were being 
killed, but they never tried to do anything to stop

25:17.387 --> 25:25.855
it. As a result, it was repeated. in Southeast 
Asia. That genie's out of the bottle. There are the

25:34.415 --> 25:44.672
war crimes trials of World War II, the punishment 
of the guilty, the infliction of the fines on the

25:34.415 --> 25:44.672
country, the isolation. Even to this day, Germany 
is still isolated in parts of the world because of

25:44.712 --> 25:50.381
what she did. And the Soviet Union is beginning to 
be understood and admit that, yes, there were

25:54.860 --> 26:00.726
several of those World War II millions that were 
attributed to death in World War II. There were

26:00.766 --> 26:03.950
several million of those were Stalin purge 
victims of the 30s.

26:06.633 --> 26:09.676
That genie's out of the bag, and we didn't do a damn 
thing. And that's the biggest crime, as far as I'm

26:11.197 --> 26:23.010
concerned, that the same people who were yelling 
about the homicides that we were committing,

26:11.197 --> 26:23.010
quotes,

26:23.665 --> 26:29.753
I know I've seen people die or take hits to keep them 
shooting in places that they were ordered not to

26:23.665 --> 26:29.753
shoot at. They were that disciplined. And to not 
see the press doing anything other than, well, the

26:32.497 --> 26:37.784
killing fields and stuff like that are starting to 
come out. But the outrage that should have been

26:37.804 --> 26:43.272
occurring while it was going on wasn't there. And 
they can't say they didn't know. Thousands of

26:45.655 --> 26:47.297
people were coming out. Photographic evidence 
was coming out.

26:54.496 --> 26:59.102
These are the disgraces of Vietnam, not the fact 
that we lost. The fact that we lost through such a

26:59.483 --> 27:15.164
political

26:59.483 --> 27:15.164
thing may have been a godsend because they've now 
created an attitude among the soldiers that I

26:59.483 --> 27:15.164
won't go to war again, but if I go, I'm going to win 
it. They've got a real problem there. I left the

27:18.810 --> 27:20.993
military and I still talk to my friends. I believe 
that is the attitude. may not say it publicly but i

27:24.044 --> 27:52.313
grew up with some of these guys that are colonels 
and generals now and i know how they think another

27:24.044 --> 27:52.313
problem is that the same people who were damning 
the americans are not only not yelling about paul

27:24.044 --> 27:52.313
pott they're trying to put his butt back in there 
and let him do it all over again if they don't When

27:53.828 --> 28:04.861
the South Vietnamese, or correction, when the 
Vietnamese pull out of Cambodia this time, if they

27:53.828 --> 28:04.861
allow Pol Pot to take that thing over, they're 
going to have another killing field. Another

28:07.144 --> 28:08.685
genocide.

28:11.949 --> 28:13.932
And yet we're supporting him. Our press is not 
talking about what a rotten SOB he is. The man

28:18.337 --> 28:21.220
should be executed as a war criminal, along with 
several of the leaders of the North. The Chinese

28:25.340 --> 28:32.750
army that came down to teach Vietnam a lesson in 
1979 didn't go reeling back because the South

28:25.340 --> 28:32.750
Vietnamese were such good fighters. They went 
reeling back because their lead regiments were

28:33.531 --> 28:43.906
sprayed with nerve gas and mustard gas, and the 
Chinese army is not equipped for gas warfare any

28:33.531 --> 28:43.906
better than we are. They went roaring back north 
after three weeks, not because the Vietnamese are

28:43.926 --> 28:49.654
such good fighters, because they are the Soviet 
client state and they used gas warfare. Now we've

28:55.908 --> 28:58.371
let that genie out of the bag and haven't yelled. 
We've allowed genocide to occur greater than all

28:58.391 --> 29:09.244
the casualties that the French army and the 
American armies and the Australian armies and the

28:58.391 --> 29:09.244
Thai armies and all of the armies that fought in 
Vietnam. They've allowed a greater genocide to

29:10.005 --> 29:16.333
occur without raising one word than all those 
armies inflicted on all the soldiers they were

29:17.258 --> 29:23.904
fighting as well as the civilian population.

29:23.924 --> 29:27.447
Where are these great peace lovers now? Where's 
Jane Fonda? She was up north making calls to us

29:30.409 --> 29:34.413
after she'd had her show in the South. She's 
running around now that her political turkey of a

29:36.915 --> 29:45.983
Chicago 7 boyfriend is thinking about running for 
other offices. I understand they're getting

29:48.289 --> 29:49.750
divorced now, good. But she was ready to 
apologize. Well, with the Vietnam Helicopter

29:52.713 --> 29:56.196
Pilots Association, we all agreed. When she 
apologizes to every goddamn name on that wall in

29:56.676 --> 30:01.841
Washington, then come talk to me. But where is she 
in relationship to the genocide that has

30:04.264 --> 30:08.387
occurred? And it's about to occur again as the 
North Vietnamese Army pulls out of Cambodia.

30:15.241 --> 30:18.165
Where is the newspapers that should be raising 
hell? Ask your professor to ask his students to ask

30:18.245 --> 30:23.011
their hometown papers that.

30:30.260 --> 30:31.401
So that's the great defeat. That is the great 
defeat. It's the moral defeat of the things that

30:33.524 --> 30:43.797
this world had fought two wars to eliminate. Gas 
warfare was outlawed after World War I. It didn't

30:47.253 --> 30:53.521
come up except, well, the Russians and the Germans 
used it on each other once and claimed it was an

30:47.253 --> 30:53.521
accident. We had a, quote, accident in southern 
Italy. I mean, you know. They didn't use it, even in

30:58.328 --> 31:00.471
their worst moments. Countries were going down. 
They did not unleash the gas warfare genie because

31:01.893 --> 31:07.962
they knew how horrible that stuff was. And 
genocide, after the ovens of all the

31:10.523 --> 31:27.238
concentration camps were exposed, and after the 
prison camps of Asia were exposed,

31:10.523 --> 31:27.238
genocide was as chemical warfare.

31:30.300 --> 31:39.028
Yet the political opportunist who came to power as 
a result of the 60s genuine movement in concern for

31:30.300 --> 31:39.028
peace, the political opportunist who came in 
power there, didn't have the will to either

31:39.717 --> 31:51.672
militarily or even diplomatically raise cane, 
not only over the chemical genie. They allowed it

31:52.573 --> 31:58.300
to begin in the 60s and didn't say a word about it 
until all of a sudden 5,000 people get 5,000. Hell,

31:58.340 --> 32:01.865
they killed 14,000 coming across the shuttle 
waterway. The only thing it was is they weren't

32:02.786 --> 32:06.331
5,000 civilian Kurds. They were 14,000. Iranian 
soldiers. Sprayed them just like fly spray,

32:11.777 --> 32:14.501
killed them as dead as a hammer. I mean, they were 
still human beings. And there wasn't a word said

32:16.404 --> 32:17.686
about that. When they finally did decide to 
publicize it, it popped up for about a year, six

32:18.327 --> 32:23.335
months, and it's gone again. Half the countries 
around the world now, third world countries, are

32:25.017 --> 32:32.308
building chemical factories because they, hey, 
we've got an answer to high-tech warfare. That

32:34.391 --> 32:35.773
chemical genie was unleashed. Nobody said 
anything. Genocide was allowed to occur. Nobody

32:40.084 --> 32:41.105
was punished. That's the tragedy of the Vietnam 
defeat. It's the tragedy of the lack of will of the

32:44.669 --> 32:52.178
political leadership of half the world as a result 
of the Vietnam defeat. And the corruption of the

32:53.520 --> 33:00.328
American press, and I think to a great extent the 
corruption of the American school system.

33:01.109 --> 33:07.757
Because there are certain, in my opinion, 
departments that are not necessarily interested

33:08.648 --> 33:11.951
in teaching history correctly or teaching values 
correctly. They're interested in fostering or

33:11.991 --> 33:17.396
furthering some private political agenda. I'm 
not a rightist, I'm not a leftist, I think I'm a

33:17.416 --> 33:20.559
humanist. That's

33:20.579 --> 33:25.064
bad. Okay, the war, some people came out of it 
stronger, others it affected them in a negative

33:25.084 --> 33:32.931
way. What effects the war had on you? on your life 
since?

33:44.056 --> 33:49.523
I made friendships there that are still as strong 
as family relationships are to this day.

33:52.707 --> 34:03.721
It gave me a sense of values as to what is really 
important. I've told my children to choose their

34:05.112 --> 34:09.798
fights as carefully as they choose their friends, 
make sure they're worth it. Because as you said, it

34:10.999 --> 34:13.442
did affect people in a negative way. As you said 
earlier, I was more mature and probably a little

34:15.144 --> 34:32.706
better able to handle it than some 18 or 19 year old 
boy that was drafted out of school or off the

34:15.144 --> 34:32.706
streets, put into basic training for three 
months, stuck in combat, and a week later he's

34:34.053 --> 34:39.821
seeing people that he had been talking to blown 
apart.

34:42.785 --> 34:53.621
One guy said that there's nothing, and I believe 
this came out of, I'm not sure whether it came out of

34:42.785 --> 34:53.621
Vietnam or whether it was out of World War II, but I 
heard this statement or I read it. There is nothing

34:53.641 --> 35:00.010
more dangerous than a 19-year-old kid

35:03.112 --> 35:08.858
He just watched his buddy get his brains blown out. 
So some of the things that these young soldiers

35:08.878 --> 35:18.668
did, they're

35:08.878 --> 35:18.668
understandable. Some of them coming back 
mentally, having problems. I came back to a wife, a

35:25.555 --> 35:31.161
new baby, and some sense of family security. and 
back into the military community where what I did

35:31.917 --> 35:36.341
was appreciated. Yet I came back on the aircraft 
with both times. Very bad the second time. Came

35:45.389 --> 35:54.457
back on the aircraft with young kids and landing in 
California or in Washington depending on where we

35:45.389 --> 35:54.457
came into. In my case it was California. You go 
down, take the bus from the base to the airport and

35:56.458 --> 36:01.823
in the airport You have to wear your uniform 
because that's what you've got. And you've got

36:06.572 --> 36:09.635
your ribbons on it. And you have people calling you 
baby killer or making comments. And I could see how

36:15.702 --> 36:19.806
that would affect a 19- or 20-year-old man. Now, it 
made me very angry. And the young hippie saw that if

36:24.812 --> 36:31.219
he pursued his line of questioning, he was 
probably going to get killed. But you have to

36:32.363 --> 36:37.111
understand this kid has been in combat about a week 
before this occurs. Thinks he's doing something

36:38.553 --> 36:42.219
right because he's been told he's been doing 
something right. His country has said he's been

36:42.239 --> 36:45.344
doing something right. His president and his 
generals have given him medals. And he steps off an

36:50.553 --> 36:51.975
airplane. And the first thing he sees is his 
contemporaries calling him fool, baby killer,

36:53.187 --> 36:58.835
murderer, spitting at him. He wants to get out of 
that uniform and get away from that as quickly as

36:59.817 --> 37:03.402
possible. And he goes into a community where there 
may not have been another veteran, unless he

37:03.983 --> 37:12.274
happened to have known him personally, because 
they weren't walking around advertising. He had

37:12.294 --> 37:13.376
nobody to talk to. When I came back, I had the five 
guys that I'd known for a long time. And for four or

37:18.183 --> 37:21.528
five years after that, we went through our own 
withdrawal. We drank. We talked, we did our job, we

37:23.478 --> 37:26.822
flew, we did our thing. But looking back on it, that 
was our way of dealing with the stresses, and it

37:26.843 --> 37:32.951
took two or three years to draw that. There was no 
American Legion organization waiting there for

37:32.971 --> 37:37.717
him when he came back from Vietnam. That was a home 
for World War II guys to sit around and swap glides

37:38.378 --> 37:43.465
and drink beer and play bingo. And he goes to the 
VFWs looking at the same thing, or at the best, it

37:44.967 --> 37:51.155
was Korean guys that were 15 years older than him. 
And When you would go into those places, you'd

37:52.958 --> 37:57.725
hear, oh, well, yeah, you have to think, you should 
have been there in my war. Boy, you won't see

37:57.745 --> 37:58.586
something. I mean, he's trying to convince them 
this kid has just been shot all to hell or seen

37:58.607 --> 38:02.552
something like that. I can understand how he got 
screwed up. And in World War II, they had these

38:04.475 --> 38:09.303
camps for these guys who had really been in intense 
combat or POWs. They tried to bring them down. Army

38:12.267 --> 38:19.378
brought this guy back, dumped him on the goddamn 
streets with an early discharge because they were

38:12.267 --> 38:19.378
winding down, and put him on the streets back to his 
home. The VA was a bureaucracy and still is a

38:19.398 --> 38:22.122
bureaucracy. that was geared to help the World War 
II veteran. And they talk a good deal about helping

38:24.978 --> 38:28.142
the modern vet. But basically what they do is they 
leave the modern vet to get enough political

38:28.162 --> 38:32.689
power. And that's why you have organizations. I 
don't belong to anything with the Vietnam

38:35.553 --> 38:37.856
Helicopter Power Association. I haven't even 
joined a church since that period, because I'm

38:37.876 --> 38:44.206
disgusted with organizations.

38:44.867 --> 38:47.130
They don't seem to work. But these veterans 
organizations, these quasi-things that were

38:47.937 --> 38:56.487
formed locally, in some cases nationally, that 
tend to get together and rap and bullshit. I've

38:56.907 --> 38:59.731
seen guys sitting there that I know spent the war at 
Tonsenut. And they're talking about how bad the

39:00.652 --> 39:02.073
war is. And I've seen guys talk stories and those 
kind of things. I've gone to these gun shows and

39:04.656 --> 39:06.959
talked to them. And you find out where they were, 
and you start pinning them down. And the closest

39:10.703 --> 39:13.827
thing I saw to combat is they might have heard an 
explosion. they're claiming they're blaming all

39:15.173 --> 39:42.784
their problems on it i say there are some genuine 
casualties out of that war and they were not taken

39:15.173 --> 39:42.784
care of and that's a disgrace and everybody that 
was over there paid his dues and served and should

39:15.173 --> 39:42.784
be helped i don't care if he came back and in order to 
ingratiate himself back into this community he

39:15.173 --> 39:42.784
felt ostracized from it he became a doper or went 
180 out was it to make friends again with people who

39:15.173 --> 39:42.784
he felt wouldn't be friends with him if he didn't do 
that. I don't know why they did it. But there's no

39:47.293 --> 39:53.021
organizations there to help them, or at least to 
help them with any consistency.

39:55.704 --> 39:58.368
What ties do you have with Vietnam right now still? 
The Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association, we

39:59.510 --> 40:03.936
won't allow politicians to address us. We're a 
closed organization. Anybody who flew

40:08.602 --> 40:12.788
helicopters in Vietnam can belong, even 
communists. Our bylaws don't preclude the Red

40:14.371 --> 40:18.735
Army if one of them wants to join. We've discussed 
that. We've allowed the South Vietnamese

40:21.057 --> 40:27.463
helicopter pilots to join, Australian 
helicopter pilots to join us. The only criteria is

40:27.664 --> 40:31.467
you had to have flown helicopters over there. And 
our only action,

40:32.148 --> 40:40.716
other than getting together, checking on people, 
seeing who's where, helping each other if we can,

40:42.535 --> 40:52.571
is to try to write history primarily of US Army 
aviation in the Vietnam War and correct it because

40:42.535 --> 40:52.571
we found that casualties were being hidden. We've 
had a terrible time digging up the helicopter

40:53.112 --> 40:57.219
pilot casualties. If a guy died on the ground as a 
result of his aircraft coming in and then he gets

40:57.820 --> 41:08.577
down and he gets shot on the ground, he's a ground 
casualty. If his aircraft was sitting on the

41:09.080 --> 41:17.067
ground in an assault and got hit with a mortar 
shell, the fact that the rotor was turning, he had

41:09.080 --> 41:17.067
just landed and was attempting to take off. The 
plane blew up. It was not counted as an aviation

41:18.749 --> 41:20.651
casualty. It was a ground casualty. It was 10 years 
after the war was over before we knew that we were

41:22.893 --> 41:32.021
taking a higher casualty rate in the helicopter 
world than the Army or Marine infantry. But as you

41:33.903 --> 41:37.146
can see from the book, we've got it documented. 
We've dug out the government records. And so it's

41:41.425 --> 41:49.256
to write the history of the unit, correct the 
records, and scholarships. And that's it, other

41:50.778 --> 41:56.186
than just a network of good old boys. Good old boys, 
huh? Yeah, and good old boys in an old fashioned

41:58.549 --> 42:04.838
sense of guys who were there and the fact that you 
were there makes you my friend until you show me

42:06.033 --> 42:35.533
you're not type of thing it's a camaraderie that 
was built up it was a brotherhood of war is old

42:06.033 --> 42:35.533
Griffin's book says by the way that's not his real 
name Griffin he used the term Griffin as it was used

42:06.033 --> 42:35.533
by someone long ago which basically says put them 
off the track of who you really are or what you're

42:36.037 --> 42:37.002
really doing. But that's the coin Brotherhood of 
War is titled.

44:05.170 --> 44:24.615
But

44:05.170 --> 44:24.615
I can see

44:05.170 --> 44:24.615
a guy who's our president right now was very much a 
part of the decision processes, the political

44:05.170 --> 44:24.615
processes, in 1973. He was ambassador to China.

44:31.784 --> 44:34.047
The protégés of Lodge The Congress is full of the 
opportunists who came in at that time, and they're

44:35.258 --> 44:42.666
doing the same thing in Central America. They're 
ripping off another plumb to feed to the

44:42.686 --> 44:49.733
communists with a beautiful air base. It's going 
to make a dam now, but they're going to allow a

44:49.853 --> 44:56.761
slaughter to occur. I think socialism would be 
good for South America. It's the only way to get the

44:59.083 --> 45:03.628
dons and the princes out of the damn power 
structure and get something to the peons. But

45:05.583 --> 45:12.452
there's a distinguishing element between 
communism and socialism. I mean, one is a little

45:12.472 --> 45:18.821
more democratic multi-party.

45:21.825 --> 45:33.480
And I don't believe a man should have to give up 
total freedom or some form of security in order to

45:21.825 --> 45:33.480
eat, which is what the communists demand. And then 
their system is so damn inefficient that it fails

45:35.232 --> 45:41.219
to feed the man what they've promised. But they've 
got the guns to enforce their rule.
