WEBVTT

00:01.246 --> 00:18.377
was a good chemist you know he had worked with monsanto for a number of years and he had a research program going here and he was a nice person just a delightful show that by the time you get that grant there's more research that's right things are beginning to shape up now

00:19.066 --> 00:26.336
And even our teaching load went way down, and since we started developing the graduate course I got more into senior and graduate courses.

00:26.997 --> 00:36.450
And they did away with these small groups, you know, we just had large sections of roughly a hundred, and that greatly reduced our teaching loads.

00:36.470 --> 00:43.479
Do you remember any reaction, you and your colleagues, when Earl Rudder was selected as the new president?

00:43.720 --> 00:44.140
No.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.605
I wasn't aware of any great reaction in the department or anything like that.

00:48.344 --> 00:53.012
But Earl, well we only know that the guy revolutionized his campus.

00:53.934 --> 00:55.096
And he was a great man.

00:55.116 --> 01:02.168
I could pick up the phone, talk to Earl Rudd's secretary, and she would make an appointment with me for him.

01:02.569 --> 01:04.212
There was never any question about it.

01:04.412 --> 01:05.574
Did you ever go over Angela?

01:05.594 --> 01:06.556
I went several times.

01:06.576 --> 01:07.297
Describe that.

01:07.899 --> 01:13.288
Well I don't, he was, you know, he was willing to hear what you had to say.

01:13.589 --> 01:15.992
He himself didn't have a hell of a lot to say.

01:16.472 --> 01:21.919
But he listened carefully to what you had to say and I noticed he took notes.

01:21.939 --> 01:26.103
Now I greatly admired that, plus the fact that he was available.

01:26.123 --> 01:29.167
Do you remember what you chatted with him about?

01:29.708 --> 01:37.116
Well I told him that, this is a guess, but I remember the things that were on my mind, I remember telling him that

01:37.906 --> 01:46.482
Texas, the state of Texas, had the largest petroleum industry and the largest chemical industry in the world, not only in the United States.

01:47.364 --> 01:52.955
And Texas A&M, being a major school, should develop a first-class chemistry department.

01:54.437 --> 01:55.359
What was his reaction?

01:56.201 --> 01:58.986
Well, as I say, he listened very attentively.

01:59.573 --> 02:01.535
took it in, made some notes.

02:01.635 --> 02:03.778
Did he say yes, that it should be?

02:03.798 --> 02:05.340
Well, I don't remember.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.442
I'd be putting words in his mouth.

02:07.803 --> 02:13.169
But all I can say is the man seriously paid attention to what you had to say.

02:14.591 --> 02:23.922
And as he was leading to these changes here on the campus, what did you and your colleagues think about coeducation and integration?

02:23.942 --> 02:28.247
Oh, everybody was very much in favor of coeducation and integration.

02:28.801 --> 02:31.043
I can't think of anybody that was not.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.408
You want a little bit of a story that upset me?

02:35.528 --> 02:35.848
Yes.

02:36.349 --> 02:45.078
One of my old, one of the first colleagues I met when I came here, and I shan't give his name, but he was a guy who had been here many, many years.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.184
Texas A&M played Boston College, I remember, in the 50s sometime.

02:52.345 --> 02:54.808
And Boston College had some black players.

02:55.447 --> 03:07.825
And this guy made the remark on Monday morning after the Saturday football game, I never thought I'd live to see a day that a nigger would be playing on Kyle Field.

03:08.085 --> 03:10.589
That really made me feel upset.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.695
Did anybody speak to him?

03:14.975 --> 03:25.150
Oh no, this was just a conversation between him and me in the hall, on Monday after talking about the game.

03:25.923 --> 03:28.286
The revelation of my pardon.

03:28.306 --> 03:35.054
Do you remember any events in your classes or in the hallway of the first blacks or the first women?

03:36.215 --> 03:36.696
No.

03:36.716 --> 03:36.776
No.

03:36.796 --> 03:38.778
Everything was very smoothly.

03:39.239 --> 03:40.020
Underwent the change.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.903
No problems whatsoever.

03:43.604 --> 03:48.429
What about the change in the name from the A&M College of Texas to Texas A&M University?

03:48.449 --> 03:51.573
Well I think most people that there was a great change, you know.

03:51.593 --> 03:53.415
I didn't get any feelings of it.

03:53.896 --> 03:55.117
Do you remember a man named Zener?

03:55.498 --> 03:55.778
Sure.

03:58.019 --> 04:01.102
He was dean of the College of Science.

04:01.122 --> 04:03.064
Came from Chicago?

04:03.084 --> 04:03.925
In Pennsylvania?

04:04.005 --> 04:04.625
I don't know.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.228
Anyway, came from one of the big schools up in Ohio.

04:07.428 --> 04:11.512
You know, Zener was a real physicist.

04:11.612 --> 04:15.015
I mean an honest to goodness first class physicist.

04:15.035 --> 04:24.685
When I'd call up to go see Zener, like I'm talking to you now, we never got to the situation, why are you here?

04:24.825 --> 04:25.125
Nothing.

04:25.726 --> 04:27.267
He would immediately get a piece of chalk.

04:28.259 --> 04:31.505
go to the blackboard and tell me what do you think of this idea?"

04:31.525 --> 04:37.235
And he'd talk physics for the whole damn time I left there and never getting to.

04:37.255 --> 04:38.477
Well I think he was misplaced.

04:39.078 --> 04:42.143
He was a true scientist and not even remotely.

04:42.584 --> 04:46.691
However he was a breath of air, you know, a breath of fresh air as they say.

04:47.593 --> 04:52.061
Now when you arrived, chemistry was a part of the School of Arts and Sciences.

04:52.181 --> 04:53.423
I believe so.

04:53.825 --> 04:58.033
And in 59, Frank Hubert was hired as the dean.

04:58.053 --> 05:08.271
As things began to grow, do you feel chemistry was treated fairly, equitably?

05:09.353 --> 05:11.797
They never had adequate facilities or money.

05:11.817 --> 05:14.542
I mean, the man who made the change was Arthur Martell.

05:15.143 --> 05:17.908
But I think Martell was hired by Rudder.

05:18.867 --> 05:19.668
I think so.

05:19.748 --> 05:20.749
He came in 67.

05:21.110 --> 05:25.515
Do you have any idea how he was identified as the one?

05:25.555 --> 05:28.800
Well no.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.642
But I think this is important.

05:30.682 --> 05:34.567
I think Rudder, together with, remember Dean Page?

05:36.269 --> 05:39.633
While I was at Oak Ridge I wrote a letter to Dean Page.

05:39.914 --> 05:46.562
You know I cut out some stuff out of the chemical and engineering news telling him essentially what I told Rudder.

05:46.846 --> 05:55.739
The Texas A&M Chemistry Department, because of the importance of refining in the chemical industry in the state, should be up there.

05:57.301 --> 06:11.822
Well, I understand, I don't know who got Arthur Martell here, but I understand he was given a white paper to do what the hell he wanted to do and that the administration would stand behind him financially.

06:12.203 --> 06:15.688
Did you ever hear of whether or not there was any

06:16.867 --> 06:31.421
external political or former student or industrial person or persons that encouraged, because like chemistry got far more encouragement than did physics.

06:32.262 --> 06:32.663
Yeah.

06:32.683 --> 06:33.403
Or biology.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.385
Yeah, I know that.

06:35.405 --> 06:35.866
All right.

06:36.286 --> 06:38.368
Did you know of Martell before he came?

06:38.508 --> 06:38.849
Oh, yes.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.311
Yes, he's a very, very famous chemist.

06:41.371 --> 06:43.093
No two ways about it.

06:43.597 --> 06:47.081
And what was the reaction of the department when he came?

06:47.101 --> 06:56.972
Well I think we're delighted to get him because you know we knew the guy was aggressive, that he had big plans and that he was the type of person that would put him into play.

06:57.633 --> 07:10.988
Because I, Pete Rodriguez would tell me that when Martell wanted something and they'd turn him down, he would go with that letter to Rudder or whoever, to Dean or something, you know, I've got this letter here.

07:10.968 --> 07:14.402
So you guys better honor your commitment.

07:14.422 --> 07:17.434
But the department has become a first class department.

07:17.554 --> 07:19.442
And I think it's largely due to Martell.

07:19.692 --> 07:24.939
Now, the research facilities were still very limited when he got here.

07:24.959 --> 07:28.443
No, well, they'd already, we got the new wing in 58, I think.

07:28.463 --> 07:28.764
Oh, okay.

07:28.784 --> 07:31.628
Yeah, we got the new wing in 58 when Callaway was there.

07:31.648 --> 07:32.749
Okay.

07:32.769 --> 07:35.393
And then, of course, you know, the construction went crazy after that.

07:35.433 --> 07:36.574
We got two more new wings.

07:36.654 --> 07:44.424
Was that, were those wings, when they were added, was there appropriate departmental input as to what should be in them?

07:45.225 --> 07:45.666
Oh, I,

07:45.950 --> 07:54.807
I don't know for a fact but I have every reason to think so, because Arthur Martell was into stuff, you know what I mean?

07:55.147 --> 08:00.297
Well he would appoint, I remember, I was not a member, but he would appoint a building committee

08:00.968 --> 08:07.977
And then we were asked, as faculty, what we thought the department needed in way of research facilities.

08:07.997 --> 08:15.446
I remember, for example, that Art Isbell wanted high-pressure laboratories, you know, for safety reasons.

08:15.546 --> 08:18.169
They were constructed in a very particular manner.

08:19.230 --> 08:22.234
So, you know, so the things changed.

08:23.159 --> 08:26.690
Things were great when Arthur became head.

08:26.931 --> 08:32.629
Under Dr. Martell, did the department get together and discuss

08:33.908 --> 08:35.890
direction and so forth?

08:36.211 --> 08:42.658
Well, Arthur, I must say, was not democratic in his administration.

08:42.758 --> 08:44.060
He was highly autocratic.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.882
Yeah, he was not the chairman, he was the head.

08:45.902 --> 08:48.465
No, he was the head, let there be no doubt about it.

08:48.905 --> 08:50.307
Absolutely.

08:50.687 --> 08:55.152
During those years, did you all get annual evaluations?

08:55.232 --> 09:00.118
Yes, we did receive periodic evaluations and we had an evaluation committee.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.300
Well I guess every department has it now.

09:04.602 --> 09:09.328
A new faculty member is ready for promotion from assistant to associate and such.

09:09.569 --> 09:12.693
And that's something that didn't exist prior to that time.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.677
The department had just did it entirely on its own.

09:15.717 --> 09:20.263
And do you remember when you became a full professor?

09:20.343 --> 09:20.804
Yeah.

09:20.824 --> 09:25.129
That's an interesting situation because I was on my two year leave at Oak Ridge.

09:25.590 --> 09:26.591
Please describe that.

09:26.992 --> 09:29.295
And the head of

09:30.355 --> 09:37.144
The dean of science, you know, I can't remember his name, but we called him Curly, a wide haired guy with very wavy hair.

09:39.807 --> 09:48.980
But he was kind of interested in promoting the scientific attributes of the university.

09:51.583 --> 09:58.472
And while I was in Oak Ridge, I went there for a year and then asked for a second year, but they awarded me.

09:59.498 --> 10:04.164
And I got this letter from him, or some kind of indication, whether it was a letter, a phone call or not.

10:04.184 --> 10:11.492
He told me during the second year when I was supposed to come back, tell him he had been promoted, and I was getting a $200 a month raise.

10:11.552 --> 10:13.435
And that $200 was a big raise.

10:13.475 --> 10:20.744
It was about 19, when was that, about roughly 68 thereabouts.

10:20.764 --> 10:26.130
So I think he felt that I was going to stay in Oak Ridge, you see.

10:26.363 --> 10:30.649
But, heck, I had to be there if I wanted to.

10:30.669 --> 10:36.938
Under Martell, who were some of the important faculty additions?

10:38.420 --> 10:47.874
Well, many, but he brought Tsui, T-S-U-T-S-U-I, in, who was a very well-known organo-metallic chemist.

10:47.894 --> 10:49.596
And, of course, he brought Derek Barton in.

10:50.698 --> 10:52.340
He brought Ian Scott in.

10:52.380 --> 10:55.144
There were more.

10:55.364 --> 10:55.965
There were more.

10:56.570 --> 11:01.045
And then he got a lot of young fellows that had done very well, Burke Breider.

11:01.936 --> 11:04.799
Schweikert already was here at the time.

11:05.759 --> 11:13.586
During those years, late 60s, early 70s, in what areas was the chemistry department's strongest?

11:13.626 --> 11:14.988
What fields of special services?

11:15.008 --> 11:19.972
Well decidedly what we call the inorganic division, because he brought cotton in.

11:20.072 --> 11:22.474
Now cotton was truly an international figure.

11:22.494 --> 11:24.636
That's Albert Cotton from Harvard.

11:24.716 --> 11:25.617
From MIT.

11:25.897 --> 11:26.538
MIT.

11:26.558 --> 11:27.379
Yeah, yeah.

11:27.399 --> 11:28.880
He's been very happy here, Cotton.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.082
Boy, and he's been a big asset to the department.

11:31.923 --> 11:39.034
Yeah, I mean, you know, but I think now every division is well recognized.

11:39.054 --> 11:54.437
I think the last time where we were ranked, I know in the top 15 in the country, and if Barton hadn't died we'd probably be going in top ten, maybe we'll see where we make it or not.

11:55.278 --> 12:00.065
By the time Martell got here, where was the research money coming from?

12:00.566 --> 12:05.853
Well, the people were, most of them were sufficiently well-known.

12:05.893 --> 12:09.679
They were getting government grants, you know, NIH, and it's that phase.

12:09.699 --> 12:11.161
So they bring it in themselves.

12:11.241 --> 12:13.064
Yeah, yeah.

12:13.084 --> 12:20.435
And when they came, these outstanding people, were they normally provided appropriate research space?

12:20.755 --> 12:21.576
Oh, heavens, yes.

12:21.937 --> 12:24.120
Yeah, if you were, you know,

12:24.387 --> 12:30.496
I was displaced twice because he brought Tsutsui and he told me, oh yeah, give this guy new office.

12:30.516 --> 12:33.600
He sent me off to the old state chemist building.

12:34.782 --> 12:43.053
And then when the new building was done then he'd find a spot for me there, which he did, but he accommodated the new people.

12:43.073 --> 12:47.880
Now in those years what were the advanced courses you were teaching?

12:48.586 --> 12:57.651
well you don't need the course numbers, but the advanced inorganic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, those are the main ones.

12:58.525 --> 13:11.698
I did teach a graduate course in analytical chemistry, but that's because our analytical division was weak at the time, but it greatly increased in prestige and competence.

13:11.718 --> 13:17.664
But mostly graduate courses in organic chemistry, especially organometallic chemistry.

13:17.684 --> 13:21.307
Those advanced courses, what kind of students were taking those?

13:21.407 --> 13:23.289
Graduate students, strictly graduate students.

13:23.309 --> 13:27.233
But the junior or senior that you taught, were they all chemists?

13:27.213 --> 13:29.781
Oh yeah, they're virtually all chemistry majors.

13:31.045 --> 13:40.817
And also if we got new graduate students from a smaller liberal arts college where they didn't get advanced courses, they would take those for graduate credit.

13:41.523 --> 13:48.991
How has the makeup of the graduate student body changed in these 30 years or so?

13:49.552 --> 13:51.734
Where were they from originally and where now?

13:52.695 --> 14:02.346
The transition has been that we have virtually, I don't know what the percentage is, but a very large fraction of foreign students.

14:03.027 --> 14:04.628
But it's not just we.

14:04.648 --> 14:10.635
I think it's a national situation because you pay a

14:11.071 --> 14:21.681
somebody a thousand dollars a month to handle a couple of like, you know, lab sessions, and they come from India or China, this is pretty darn good money.

14:22.622 --> 14:26.786
Plus they want to come because of the prestige of doing graduate work in the United States.

14:27.627 --> 14:32.631
Originally the first graduate students you had here were from where?

14:33.532 --> 14:35.274
They were American guys.

14:35.935 --> 14:38.597
Were they most of them A&M undergraduates?

14:39.100 --> 14:42.717
At the very start mostly, but it quickly changed.

14:42.737 --> 14:45.651
I had Mary Janian from Florida.

14:47.302 --> 14:48.845
Oh heck, I can't go over all of them.

14:48.885 --> 14:50.868
A lot of them came from the smaller Texas schools.

14:50.928 --> 14:52.771
We did a great deal of recruiting.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.756
We'd go to visit little schools in Texas.

14:55.816 --> 14:58.661
I remember going to, was it Wesleyan in Fort Worth?

14:59.042 --> 14:59.983
Texas Wesleyan.

15:00.003 --> 15:05.352
Texas Wesleyan, went up to Northeast Texas, the Texas Baptist, I think that's the name.

15:05.372 --> 15:09.900
But we used to go traveling around a lot, giving talks and recruiting students.

15:10.184 --> 15:18.076
Is there any graduate student that you remember from your early days with great pride?

15:18.977 --> 15:26.909
Well, the one who's been most successful, gee, I should know his name, but he became professor at Purdue.

15:27.790 --> 15:28.772
And has done very well.

15:29.433 --> 15:30.454
Very bright kid.

15:30.474 --> 15:31.937
Did he do his doctoral degree with you?

15:31.997 --> 15:34.200
With me, uh-huh.

15:34.220 --> 15:38.166
And then another fellow that I had early on became director of...

15:39.344 --> 15:46.306
Monsanto's fiber division, you know, synthetic fiber division in Anniston, Alabama or thereabouts.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.533
Where did they do their undergraduate, do you remember?

15:49.114 --> 15:49.435
Well no.

15:51.642 --> 15:53.488
One, University of Wichita.

15:54.582 --> 15:56.605
And the other fellow came from a small Texas.

15:56.766 --> 15:58.489
No, no, he came from May and Em, that's right.

15:58.509 --> 16:00.392
Yeah, yeah.

16:01.173 --> 16:15.638
And as this change came about, what international, what nations or regions are most numerous here in the country?

16:15.658 --> 16:17.882
Oh, well, India and China, that's for sure.

16:18.824 --> 16:19.485
Absolutely.

16:19.525 --> 16:20.286
Mainland China.

16:21.329 --> 16:24.994
Lately mostly mainland, but we used to be mostly Taiwan.

16:26.096 --> 16:27.918
And then it became mainland, you know.

16:28.399 --> 16:28.720
Yes.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.867
Do you remember some pioneer female graduate students?

16:34.888 --> 16:36.250
Yeah, R.V.

16:36.311 --> 16:37.352
Jean Caulfield.

16:37.833 --> 16:38.654
I remember her.

16:40.637 --> 16:43.641
Because she was from Uvalde.

16:43.925 --> 16:54.359
And I was told that she was the women's pistol champion or something like that in the state or national, but she's supposed to be a whiz-bang with the pistol.

16:56.923 --> 17:11.603
Then another girl who's now running her own company in California, Mitchell, she extracts stuff from natural products and made money, she's making money producing

17:12.157 --> 17:13.919
natural product derivatives.

17:14.841 --> 17:22.431
How did you and a doctoral student tend to kind of link up that this student would do his or her work for you?

17:22.451 --> 17:27.598
Well, the way they worked it, a student, when he came in, would simply meet.

17:27.979 --> 17:31.323
Well, they'd first decide which division they wanted to work in.

17:31.344 --> 17:34.368
Then they'd talk with each faculty member.

17:35.089 --> 17:39.415
You'd tell them about the problems you had, the research problems on which you were working.

17:39.455 --> 17:41.117
And then it was up to them.

17:42.515 --> 17:44.798
Availability of funds had something to do with it.

17:44.839 --> 17:51.469
If you had a research branch, they could put you on a research, you know, or pay so much a month in research, they usually cared for that because they didn't have to teach.

17:51.489 --> 17:59.040
All right, so in general, their research topic was closely related to your research project.

17:59.140 --> 17:59.801
Absolutely.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.185
Oh, yeah.

18:02.205 --> 18:09.636
And normally, back in the 60s and 70s, how long did it take a student to do a doctoral degree?

18:10.173 --> 18:11.936
I'd say the average was five years.

18:12.937 --> 18:14.459
It seemed like most of them took about five years.

18:14.479 --> 18:16.322
Would that include a master's also?

18:16.342 --> 18:18.786
It depends.

18:18.926 --> 18:23.252
A student who was a doctoral student usually went right through.

18:24.154 --> 18:31.625
If a situation presented itself, which indicated he would have some problems, they'd probably settle.

18:31.785 --> 18:35.691
It was sort of a settlement, well I'll get a master's degree and leave.

18:35.890 --> 18:43.584
Do you have some happy and or sad anecdotes about working with graduate students?

18:43.604 --> 18:46.189
Well, I don't have too many.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.176
But, well, I got a very unbelievable one.

18:51.558 --> 18:52.801
I had one graduate student.

18:52.901 --> 18:54.123
He never did get his degree.

18:54.143 --> 18:57.329
I say that ahead of time because what he did was inexcusable.

18:57.609 --> 18:59.012
He was quite bright, actually.

19:01.152 --> 19:06.738
He was working on a research project, and I said, we ought to present this at this meeting.

19:06.798 --> 19:08.320
The meeting was in Philadelphia.

19:09.181 --> 19:12.885
So we prepared an abstract, sent it in.

19:13.827 --> 19:14.627
It was accepted.

19:16.790 --> 19:19.053
The time of his presentation was given.

19:21.275 --> 19:23.758
I bought him an airline ticket, made a hotel reservation.

19:26.821 --> 19:26.922
Okay.

19:26.942 --> 19:28.223
Presumably he went.

19:30.059 --> 19:31.340
A few days later, I see him.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.044
Well, how was the talk?

19:35.064 --> 19:35.805
How was the meeting?

19:36.105 --> 19:36.926
Oh, just fine.

19:36.946 --> 19:37.647
Everything went great.

19:37.707 --> 19:39.108
Any questions?

19:39.128 --> 19:40.950
Yeah, I answered them with no trouble.

19:41.891 --> 19:45.035
OK, good, fine.

19:45.155 --> 19:58.969
A week later, I got a letter from the chairman of that group, of that division, saying we had acted totally unprofessionally, failing to show up to give our talk.

19:59.827 --> 20:00.628
I had no idea.

20:00.648 --> 20:01.549
I had no idea.

20:01.589 --> 20:03.471
This guy said he went there, he flew there.

20:03.491 --> 20:07.596
Did you call him in?

20:07.796 --> 20:09.137
Oh yeah, I called him in.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.058
What did he say?

20:10.118 --> 20:24.094
He gave me some ridiculous story that there was another convention going on there, hosiery or some dadgum thing like that, and he'd gone to the wrong place to get to talk.

20:24.114 --> 20:25.395
But he never did finish him.

20:25.865 --> 20:33.272
He had the name, the name I shan't give because I would identify him, of a very famous electrical engineer.

20:33.472 --> 20:37.235
I mean a name that you would recognize instantly.

20:37.255 --> 20:38.536
But he had problems.

20:38.556 --> 20:45.623
This guy had psychological problems shortly after his wife divorced him and I don't know what happened to him.

20:45.643 --> 20:48.385
But that story is one I shan't forget.

20:49.006 --> 20:51.608
What about any sad realities?

20:52.029 --> 20:54.030
Oh yeah, unfortunately.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.872
I had a student.

20:58.957 --> 21:03.066
And he was ready, he'd been around four or five years, finally.

21:03.086 --> 21:05.271
I said, okay, I think you've done enough.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.977
Write it up and finish it.

21:09.561 --> 21:15.193
And suddenly I hear that this guy's family came to pick him up from Florida.

21:16.557 --> 21:17.959
And a few weeks later he's dead.

21:18.660 --> 21:22.426
I never did find out what happened to this boy, a nice chap.

21:23.808 --> 21:26.192
Now there's all kinds of sad stories, good Lord.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.335
Some of them are funny.

21:29.116 --> 21:30.518
Maybe I'd rather hear one of those, huh?

21:30.538 --> 21:32.080
Yeah, yeah.

21:32.100 --> 21:36.507
This one guy is the guy who ended up going to Purdue and he's a full professor now, doing very well.

21:37.313 --> 21:40.276
But I had him on a research grant.

21:40.296 --> 21:43.559
He simply never came in to do research.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.842
So I finally said his name was Jim.

21:47.183 --> 21:54.551
After a few months, I said, Jim, you know, you can't possibly get your research done if you simply don't come and work.

21:55.472 --> 21:58.355
And he says, you know, I never thought about that.

21:59.736 --> 22:03.460
But we got that straightened out, and he turned out to be a crackerjack.

22:04.161 --> 22:06.223
But as far as undergraduates,

22:07.115 --> 22:09.660
I have one interest, two interesting stories.

22:09.780 --> 22:13.787
I think I told you these in an informal conversation, but they're the stories I remember.

22:14.008 --> 22:14.809
Good, good.

22:16.873 --> 22:18.656
This one boy was in my large class.

22:19.558 --> 22:21.000
Dr. Martell was the head then.

22:21.782 --> 22:24.567
He was in the Corps, and I'm at my desk.

22:25.559 --> 22:39.035
And Dr. Martell comes in with this fellow and he says, Mr. and so-and-so here claims that you are prejudiced against the court, that you grade them more harshly than you do the non-court students.

22:39.055 --> 22:39.976
And I got pissed.

22:41.198 --> 22:43.680
Because I got up and I said, that's simply a lie.

22:43.841 --> 22:47.425
And I told this kid, I said, you know, that's just not true.

22:47.445 --> 22:50.048
I took out my grade book and I said, here,

22:51.007 --> 22:52.970
I don't even know whether you're in the Corps or not.

22:53.531 --> 22:59.579
If Joe Smith got a 78, and I've given 78 speech, everybody that's got a 78 speaks.

23:00.040 --> 23:04.426
Here's my cutoff for Ds and Cs, and everybody gets treated the same way.

23:06.248 --> 23:09.333
And I says, you know, I challenged that guy to a fight.

23:09.533 --> 23:15.722
I says, you know, that is a lie, and you're getting, you bring him with my department, and I says, I really don't like that.

23:16.623 --> 23:19.647
So I don't know what happened, but he walked out.

23:21.095 --> 23:24.219
So I never saw this kid anymore, nor did any more come of it.

23:24.840 --> 23:29.066
But I go into Kroger one day, this was six months or a year later, and I see him working.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.950
He was working.

23:31.970 --> 23:37.978
And I says, why in heaven's name did you complain about my grading and you bring in my department head?

23:37.998 --> 23:41.964
You know, it's a very unpleasant situation.

23:42.084 --> 23:43.986
I said, what cost you to do that?

23:45.188 --> 23:50.916
And he says, well, my outfit wanted to get the top grades.

23:51.588 --> 23:58.020
And I was doing what I was told to do to try to get the best grades for my outfit.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.425
He was very nice at the time and he apologized.

24:00.445 --> 24:01.227
And he said, okay.

24:01.247 --> 24:05.314
I said, I'm glad to hear that.

24:05.976 --> 24:13.410
And then there's a nice story, which is a little more pleasant than that one, and this pretty girl, about 1975,

24:14.588 --> 24:15.629
very attractive girl.

24:15.689 --> 24:17.391
I know she was from down the valley.

24:17.852 --> 24:26.421
She came in at the end of the semester after the grades were out and she said, you gave me a C. Is there any way I can make a B?

24:27.262 --> 24:33.729
I said, well, you know, once I give out the grades and the distribution is made, I said, you had whatever it was, I said, you need two more points?

24:34.730 --> 24:37.954
If I give you two more points, I'm going to give everybody else two more points.

24:38.014 --> 24:39.315
I just can't do that.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.817
Once I draw the line, that's it.

24:42.258 --> 24:43.920
She didn't want to leave and she kept

24:44.710 --> 24:53.084
pounding me and demanding, not demanding, but indicating how important it was for her to get a B. Started crying.

24:53.184 --> 24:59.935
Fortunately, I was told to keep the door open when I had a female student, which I had, the door was open, starts crying.

25:01.231 --> 25:03.013
And I don't remember her name.

25:03.033 --> 25:04.855
I said, just, what is it?

25:04.955 --> 25:06.417
And then she stopped crying.

25:06.697 --> 25:08.879
But it was a long time she hung around.

25:08.999 --> 25:10.321
I said, I just can't do it.

25:11.082 --> 25:13.104
I said, but how come you, I said, you know what I'm going to do?

25:13.124 --> 25:13.905
I'm going to call your dean.

25:14.365 --> 25:16.027
I'm curious to know how you're getting along.

25:16.047 --> 25:16.768
I called her dean.

25:17.268 --> 25:18.169
And she was doing well.

25:18.429 --> 25:23.054
You know, she was, no problems with getting thrown out or being on probation.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.419
So, you're doing okay.

25:27.679 --> 25:31.103
I says, what is the problem that you're, and she says, well,

25:31.825 --> 25:36.172
If I had gotten a B, my father promised to give me a Chrysler convertible.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.736
But now I'm only going to get a Pinto.

25:38.996 --> 25:44.305
And so help me, this is a true story.

25:44.325 --> 25:45.427
Oh now that's a great one.

25:45.447 --> 25:46.548
That's a great one.

25:46.568 --> 25:49.413
But really what happens to these kids, you know.

25:50.034 --> 25:53.399
Did you ever get any phone calls in the middle of the night?

25:53.559 --> 25:53.740
No.

25:54.060 --> 25:54.240
No.

25:54.321 --> 25:58.407
Another interesting story, I broke my rule.

25:58.910 --> 26:00.692
So I drew the line, that was it.

26:00.752 --> 26:02.314
But this one fellow comes in.

26:04.737 --> 26:05.919
This one fellow comes in.

26:08.062 --> 26:09.263
He's married with two kids.

26:10.625 --> 26:13.849
He's here for about seven years trying to get a bachelor's degree.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.132
He says he's got a job in engineering.

26:16.152 --> 26:17.574
He shows me his job offer.

26:19.856 --> 26:20.677
I says, what's the point?

26:20.697 --> 26:25.103
He says, I'm taking Chemistry 102 for the fifth time and I can't pass it.

26:26.551 --> 26:27.993
He says, I can't get my degree.

26:28.013 --> 26:32.477
These people won't honor their offer for a job unless I pass it.

26:32.497 --> 26:33.018
I passed them.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.961
I figured, good Lord, what in the hell?

26:36.081 --> 26:37.783
We can't keep this guy here forever.

26:38.243 --> 26:39.285
He's done everything else.

26:39.385 --> 26:40.726
I called the dean of engineering.

26:41.347 --> 26:42.828
He's completed all the requirements.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.390
This course has gotten baffled.

26:44.410 --> 26:46.292
It's a psychological block for him.

26:46.833 --> 26:48.815
So I gave him a D, and he got through.

26:48.855 --> 26:52.879
That, I broke my rigid

26:53.281 --> 26:57.267
But that one time in 40 years doesn't seem too bad to me.

26:57.467 --> 26:58.990
And I think it was justified.

26:59.410 --> 27:04.478
As you really got immersed in the department, who were your closest buddies?

27:05.359 --> 27:06.922
Oh without question there was one.

27:09.065 --> 27:11.088
A crystallographer who's retired.

27:11.108 --> 27:12.971
He retired a few years after I did.

27:14.213 --> 27:15.795
Ed Meyers.

27:16.366 --> 27:18.692
M-E-Y-E-R-S.

27:18.852 --> 27:19.955
M-E-Y-E-R-S.

27:20.256 --> 27:23.625
Who I thought was just a very, very competent scientist.

27:23.745 --> 27:26.372
And we worked together for year in and year out.

27:26.392 --> 27:29.700
We published lots of joint papers.

27:29.950 --> 27:31.612
He was without question the closest.

27:31.632 --> 27:34.394
And I had Kurt Ergolic, I don't know if you remember him.

27:36.016 --> 27:37.337
I-R-G-O-L-I-C.

27:37.357 --> 27:38.138
I-R-G-O-L-I-C.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.481
He died a few years ago in a tragic accident.

27:41.501 --> 27:42.542
Was it K-U-R-T?

27:42.742 --> 27:47.587
Kurt, yeah, Kurt Johann Ergolic, Austrian guy.

27:47.607 --> 27:54.814
But he came in 64 as a post-doc with me and stayed here and did extremely well, extremely well.

27:54.894 --> 27:59.518
He became head of the Center for Energy and Mineral Resources,

28:00.325 --> 28:05.788
And we did just a huge amount of research together.

28:05.828 --> 28:10.909
He was just a guy that was competent, easy to work with.

28:11.277 --> 28:14.201
But he was never friendly, you know what I mean?

28:14.581 --> 28:17.465
But professionally we got along beautifully.

28:17.645 --> 28:21.571
Well who were coffee drinking and our lunch buddies?

28:21.591 --> 28:35.870
Oh yeah, Ed Meyers and then a few from Dr. Martell's group, especially this poor chap that died not long ago, a very tragic, Joe Modokitis, he died about two years ago, or a year, I forget, but he was a young man.

28:35.950 --> 28:37.572
Well relatively, he was 60.

28:37.754 --> 28:39.678
Where would you all drink coffee at?

28:39.698 --> 28:40.480
Right down the hall.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.107
One of the offices was a place for you with the coffee partners.

28:44.127 --> 28:46.212
Not an office and you sat around.

28:46.472 --> 28:47.054
Then lunch.

28:48.717 --> 28:49.078
Lunch?

28:49.118 --> 28:50.160
What did I do?

28:50.495 --> 28:53.959
I usually didn't do lunch on any kind of a regular basis.

28:55.581 --> 28:57.584
I think I used to go home for lunch.

28:58.465 --> 29:00.467
All right let's go back.

29:00.507 --> 29:04.592
You rented an apartment at first, and then where'd you all buy a house?

29:04.612 --> 29:09.037
We bought a house there in the new addition then towards the high school, Southwood?

29:09.698 --> 29:12.021
Towards the high school.

29:12.461 --> 29:14.043
In 1970 I bought a house.

29:14.764 --> 29:16.266
Thirty-five thousand bucks.

29:16.803 --> 29:22.717
about an acre, I think, in San Jose, California, go for 700,000.

29:22.777 --> 29:29.412
No, I'm not kidding, because my daughter lived in San Jose, and unbelievable, the price of real estate there.

29:29.432 --> 29:35.065
And now looking back, what was it like for your children to grow up in this community?

29:35.332 --> 29:36.855
Oh, I think it was very delightful.

29:36.935 --> 29:38.197
I think they enjoyed school.

29:39.159 --> 29:39.861
They did well.

29:42.426 --> 29:45.471
They participated in extracurricular activities.

29:46.694 --> 29:49.459
And I think they got a decent education here.

29:49.720 --> 29:54.148
In the 60s and 70s, did you think of this as a comparatively safe community?

29:54.288 --> 29:55.190
Yeah, I did.

29:55.992 --> 29:56.132
Uh-huh.

29:56.152 --> 29:56.292
Uh-huh.

29:56.312 --> 29:57.795
I certainly did.

29:58.400 --> 30:04.174
And what did you and your family, what did you all do in the community?

30:04.214 --> 30:06.079
Now to bring that up I'm going to tell you something.

30:06.099 --> 30:09.668
My wife says that they used to be here, doesn't exist anymore.

30:09.909 --> 30:10.851
What's that?

30:10.871 --> 30:13.337
Availability of golf and tennis

30:13.942 --> 30:19.429
without any questions or money for faculty wives, they don't do that anymore, do they?

30:19.610 --> 30:20.391
I don't think so.

30:20.411 --> 30:22.473
Yeah, but she said that you ought to restore that.

30:22.994 --> 30:24.176
I agree.

30:25.437 --> 30:30.805
Did you all get involved in community?

30:31.806 --> 30:32.447
Not that way.

30:33.468 --> 30:35.932
No, but did you all go to Opus?

30:36.112 --> 30:38.515
Oh, that sort of thing.

30:39.102 --> 30:41.184
Yeah we went to Opus but not all of them.

30:41.204 --> 30:43.446
You know some football games we did do.

30:43.887 --> 30:44.567
I liked that.

30:45.028 --> 30:46.069
Baseball games.

30:46.209 --> 30:48.371
In fact they'd get season tickets for baseball.

30:49.352 --> 30:52.215
What are some of your favorite football game memories?

30:53.756 --> 31:01.223
Well I saw the game with TCU when Brad Bryant was the coach, the 7-6 game, I don't know if you remember that one or not.

31:01.243 --> 31:03.646
It was a horrible day weather-wise.

31:05.488 --> 31:08.991
That was a magnificent game and well some of them were.

31:09.730 --> 31:12.454
But I remember that, and Tony Franklin was in my class.

31:13.596 --> 31:18.203
And Tony, through his coach, got me invited up to a TCU game.

31:18.784 --> 31:22.670
That's the only time I've ever flown first class on an airplane.

31:25.835 --> 31:26.837
That went to that one.

31:27.297 --> 31:37.273
And I got to know a very nice man, our former basketball coach.
