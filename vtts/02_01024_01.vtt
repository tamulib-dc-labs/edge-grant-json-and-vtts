Test, one, two, three. Test, one, two, three. It 
doesn't have a little. OK. Do

00:05.513 --> 00:19.141
you mind if I pull up this chair? No.

00:25.529 --> 00:39.511
This is an interview with Dr. Wendy Stock by 
Christine Aschenbeck on December 1st, 1992 at

00:25.529 --> 00:39.511
Texas A&M University in the Psychology Building 
concerning the feminist movement today. In the

00:39.571 --> 00:50.828
interest of accumulating knowledge, I'm asking 
you to donate this tape to me onto the Texas A&M Oral

00:39.571 --> 00:50.828
History Collection website. in the university 
archives. Is that all right with you? Yeah, that's

00:53.552 --> 00:56.096
fine.

00:56.997 --> 01:03.307
Well, first, could we collect some biographical 
data? Tell me about your life. Where did you grow

01:05.831 --> 01:07.653
up? I was born in 1954 in San Francisco, and I grew up 
there until I was 18. I went to public schools. I

01:17.690 --> 01:24.819
went to UC Berkeley for four years as an 
undergraduate and received my bachelor's in

01:17.690 --> 01:24.819
psychology in 1972. And then I went to State 
University of New York at Stony Brook, which is on

01:26.281 --> 01:33.531
Long Island, New York. And I was there for seven 
years, from 1976 to 1983. And after seven years,

01:38.177 --> 01:44.305
received my doctorate and had received my 
master's in 1980 there. And my doctorate is in the

01:45.027 --> 01:49.256
area of clinical psychology. In 1983, when I 
finished, I took a job in Florida, West Palm Beach,

01:49.977 --> 01:59.396
Florida, for one year as the director of a clinic 
for the treatment of sexual dysfunctions. And

02:00.338 --> 02:04.386
terminated that job after a year due to... 
disagreements with my bosses who seemed

02:04.957 --> 02:16.363
interested in making a lot of money on medical 
procedures for male impotence rather than

02:04.957 --> 02:16.363
treatment, psychological treatment. I became a 
research scientist in fall 1984 at Texas A&M. and

02:22.777 --> 02:36.496
was in that position for two years as project 
coordinator on a National Institute of Health

02:22.777 --> 02:36.496
research grant on differentiating psychogenic 
from organic causes of erectile dysfunction. In

02:37.477 --> 02:42.384
1986, I was hired as a visiting assistant 
professor. In 1987, I was hired tenure track, and I

02:43.004 --> 02:50.775
have completed my five years of tenure track. and 
have been denied tenure by the university this

02:50.992 --> 02:55.521
fall, 1992. I can talk more about the political 
stuff if that's what you want, like growing up, or

02:57.505 --> 03:04.197
unless you want to have specific questions on 
that. I guess you'd mentioned going to Berkeley,

03:04.217 --> 03:10.209
and that must have been in the early 70s? Yeah, 72 to 
76. neat time to be going there, I guess there was

03:12.794 --> 03:17.078
lots of activism at that time? A fair amount, 
although I was always annoyed because I had missed

03:17.098 --> 03:25.747
the free speech movement, which occurred in the 
mid-60s, 1966, 1967. And as a kid, when I was 13 in

03:26.687 --> 03:36.237
1967, which was the Summer of Love in the San 
Francisco Haight-Ashbury, and I was a little

03:26.687 --> 03:36.237
hippie-type kid. I was a straight-A student, but I 
adopted the jeans and the beads and so forth. And I

03:42.913 --> 03:59.531
also had been reading the paper and became 
convinced that Vietnam was a mistake, that we

03:42.913 --> 03:59.531
shouldn't be fighting there, and became active in 
the anti-war movement when I attended my first

03:42.913 --> 03:59.531
peace march at age 13 in San Francisco. So my 
activism really started then, rather than when I

03:59.571 --> 04:05.337
started as a freshman at Berkeley. My mother 
forbade me to go to the peace march. She was afraid

04:07.319 --> 04:09.261
I'd get my head bashed in and I went anyway, and she 
said that she would punish me, and I said, okay, and

04:09.697 --> 04:14.985
she did. She grounded me from doing my volunteer 
work at an animal museum, which really upset me,

04:15.025 --> 04:25.100
but I still felt I had done the right thing. So that 
kind of shaped the way that I've handled things

04:25.501 --> 04:37.138
since, which is if basically something seems 
right to me, I generally will do it, even if someone

04:25.501 --> 04:37.138
is threatening me because it seems to me an 
important choice to have, to be able to do things

04:37.321 --> 04:43.032
like that. So my mother contributed to my activism 
without really intending to at all. And my father

04:49.084 --> 04:52.871
did, just by being such an authoritarian kind of 
tyrant. He had been brought up in Germany, and he

04:53.532 --> 04:59.143
had very traditional German notions about 
discipline. He used to say, you'll do what I do and

04:59.663 --> 05:03.437
you'll think what I think as long as you're under 
this roof. And, of course, that had the absolute

05:03.798 --> 05:06.287
opposite effect. So early, early in my teens, I 
really... felt that I had a right to think for

05:11.020 --> 05:19.128
myself and was not going to be the robot of my 
parents' making. So after this first anti-war

05:19.148 --> 05:25.253
demonstration, I became active in the student 
anti-war movement. And in junior high and high

05:25.273 --> 05:39.947
school, I participated in demonstrations, 
peaceful demonstrations, moratoriums where we

05:25.273 --> 05:39.947
had walkouts during school time to protest the 
war, pamphleting, writing letters, walking in

05:25.273 --> 05:39.947
peace marches. I never have supported violence as 
a means for social change. There may be conditions

05:43.724 --> 05:49.890
under which that would be necessary, but I haven't 
experienced those conditions myself. And I

05:49.910 --> 05:57.556
pretty much abhor the use of violence on people, or 
anyone, and living creatures. So I was active in

05:58.137 --> 06:01.260
that movement. I got suspended once in high school 
for doing an anti-war activity. And this was

06:06.464 --> 06:13.731
really difficult for my mother, who was a public 
school teacher, to handle, that I was getting in

06:06.464 --> 06:13.731
trouble for anything and she didn't really care a 
lot. I also became active in the United Farm

06:16.157 --> 06:20.447
Workers movement. These were very underpaid 
Hispanic workers coming from Mexico generally

06:20.507 --> 06:29.408
and were paid less than the minimum wage and had 
been subjected to pesticide use that caused them

06:29.388 --> 06:34.154
to have a lot of illness and cancer. So they were 
striking, there was a grape strike and then a

06:34.515 --> 06:47.953
lettuce, grape boycott and lettuce boycott and I 
helped with other students, helped picket for the

06:34.515 --> 06:47.953
farm workers and it was sort of like a student group 
that would do this sort of activity. And we tried to

06:48.389 --> 06:56.843
educate people about their situation and their 
need for a union, which the boycott was in support

06:48.389 --> 06:56.843
of Cesar Chavez's union. And also I was a member of 
the Sierra Club and got very into the ecology

06:57.905 --> 07:03.654
movement in high school. I was into recycling. We 
recycled cans and glass and newspaper and all the

07:05.858 --> 07:11.427
stuff that people are doing still now. And I 
thought I might go into that as a career, to go into

07:11.727 --> 07:20.737
something to do with ecology or conservation of 
natural resources. I wasn't sure what I was going

07:21.338 --> 07:23.841
to do in high school. I also became aware of 
feminism. I read this book, Sisterhood is

07:26.083 --> 07:27.845
Powerful. It's like an early feminist work, an 
anthology of writings. And another one called

07:32.531 --> 07:35.274
Woman in Sexist Society. And then I also had the 
first edition of Our Bodies, Our Cells, which now

07:35.654 --> 07:40.620
has like... quadrupled in size, I think. Who is 
that book by? Boston Woman's Health Collective.

07:47.495 --> 07:49.778
It was out in newsprint when I first got it. Now it's 
this huge book and there's so much more

07:49.818 --> 07:52.582
information. So I realized, well, I'm a woman and 
these things are going to apply to me and in some

07:53.023 --> 07:59.452
ways already do. It seemed to me like another 
important struggle. And so I just felt that a big

08:02.757 --> 08:09.210
part of my life was trying to change social 
conditions and trying to make the world better.

08:09.591 --> 08:12.617
And I thought perhaps maybe I would someday join 
the Peace Corps or VISTA. So in high school, those

08:13.238 --> 08:15.623
were my concerns. I wasn't specifically 
interested in psychology. There wasn't even a

08:18.409 --> 08:23.820
class in it, so I was interested in people. I just 
didn't really know what direction I was going to

08:23.800 --> 08:27.606
take in college. I started out in Berkeley as 
pre-med. How did you choose Berkeley? It was the

08:32.534 --> 08:39.846
closest major university in the area and I had 
pretty high scores and grades. My mother went

08:40.567 --> 08:42.670
there and that Really, that was the one thing that I 
agreed with her on. I think she has very good taste

08:45.429 --> 08:49.013
in the university. That I like the campus, and it 
was the highest quality university in my area. And

08:54.919 --> 08:58.023
I thought it would be the place to go. And the 
political activism there appealed to me, because

08:58.804 --> 09:03.629
we used to see what was going on there. And then in 
our student groups, we would try to replicate some

09:03.689 --> 09:08.775
of those things. And Berkeley was a very active 
place. During the time I was there, the United

09:12.408 --> 09:18.116
States was still bombing in Vietnam and Cambodia. 
And my freshman quarter in spring of 72, we had

09:18.136 --> 09:25.927
invaded, I believe, Cambodia. And I think the Gulf 
of Tonkin was happening around then. And there was

09:30.558 --> 09:39.167
a huge moratorium and strike by students at the 
university to shut down the university and

09:30.558 --> 09:39.167
protest. And it was really, it may seem strange in 
retrospect, but it was the only way students felt

09:39.507 --> 09:44.552
they could be heard. They weren't workers. They 
couldn't strike their place of work. People did

09:48.656 --> 09:50.658
write letters and petition. But absenting 
themselves from the place where they were

09:51.038 --> 09:59.687
basically working as students was the only way 
they felt they could have an impact. So I was

10:00.207 --> 10:03.351
involved in that strike. And what happened is some 
of the people that were in the anti-war movement,

10:04.052 --> 10:25.962
mostly the street people who hung out around the 
university who were not students, became violent

10:04.052 --> 10:25.962
during these demonstrations and started 
throwing things into the windows of local

10:04.052 --> 10:25.962
merchants, which was really stupid because most 
of the merchants were supportive of the anti-war

10:04.052 --> 10:25.962
movement. Anyway, they destroyed a lot of 
property about a block away from where I lived in

10:26.077 --> 10:44.770
the dorms, and I remember studying for midterms my 
first time ever in college, having to put wet

10:26.077 --> 10:44.770
towels under the cracks of the door and windows 
because tear gas was coming in, and I didn't want to

10:26.077 --> 10:44.770
inhale tear gas and be unable to study for my tests. 
I had to go through two tax squads to get in and out of

10:44.790 --> 10:50.059
my dorm for several weeks during my first quarter. 
So that made an impression on me. I also saw the

10:52.142 --> 10:58.589
Oakland police drive like 60 miles an hour down a 
street that was filled with people just walking.

10:58.870 --> 11:03.735
And if anyone had not been able to get out of the way, 
they would have been run over. And I saw these guys

11:04.376 --> 11:10.984
with their billy clubs advancing on peaceful 
demonstrators and I know people who were beaten

11:04.376 --> 11:10.984
up. that weren't throwing rocks and that were 
just, like, going to class. So that also

11:15.009 --> 11:17.633
politicized me. It made me even more distrustful 
of the police and the abuses that the police have

11:17.653 --> 11:26.486
been put to historically in this country. You're 
probably aware how they could use to break up

11:27.648 --> 11:35.740
strikes and kill people, even, like, carrying 
silkwood on people's backs. So I saw them doing

11:36.361 --> 11:45.820
this to people that weren't being violent and 
destructive, and I think it was educational, kind

11:36.361 --> 11:45.820
of chilling.

11:49.167 --> 11:56.682
What was your first activity towards the feminist 
movement, or when did that become a main concern

11:49.167 --> 11:56.682
with you? There wasn't really a feminist group in 
high school, and I wasn't a member of a feminist

11:57.353 --> 12:05.026
group in college. I wasn't a member of NOW. NOW 
seemed very, like, middle class and too

12:08.452 --> 12:12.499
traditional in Berkeley. I worked as a rape 
counselor for a while, and that continued to make

12:13.300 --> 12:23.277
me more aware of women's issues.

12:23.425 --> 12:30.939
There were women's studies classes, and I took a 
number of comparative lit courses in women and

12:23.425 --> 12:30.939
literature. I took a year's worth to satisfy some 
of my requirements, and I became aware of women

12:30.959 --> 12:41.097
writers, and that a lot of them were writing 
feminist kinds of works, even earlier writers.

12:41.414 --> 12:50.009
like Doris Lessing and Grace Paley and some of the 
new writers were coming out with fairly feminist

12:41.414 --> 12:50.009
material. So it was actually through literature 
and in psychology there were studies that were

12:50.029 --> 13:00.628
starting to be done in the area of psychology of 
women and I just scarfed these things up. I also

13:01.229 --> 13:03.152
lived in an all-women's living situation called a 
student cooperative for four years and I guess

13:03.132 --> 13:21.917
through living in that situation I became aware of 
how much women could do because we did our own

13:03.132 --> 13:21.917
maintenance and so I became a part of the 
maintenance crew and learned how to do wiring and

13:03.132 --> 13:21.917
learned how to do the drill and electric saws and 
Cousinly masculine. Right. And I'd never been

13:24.083 --> 13:27.373
particularly socialized to be traditionally 
feminine. My mother was a whack in the army in World

13:27.413 --> 13:30.141
War II. So she was really kind of a tomboy when she 
was growing up. And she never enforced femininity

13:34.874 --> 13:37.418
on me. But I hadn't had the experience of working in 
male kinds of trades and things. And this taught me

13:43.768 --> 13:46.772
that I could do a lot more than I realized. And other 
women were even better at it than I was. And there

13:48.856 --> 13:52.141
were women who were electronics experts and 
wiring experts. And I was like, I was educated by

13:52.161 --> 13:55.366
that. And I also assumed leadership in the house. I 
was the manager for a year. That leadership

14:00.794 --> 14:02.616
experience was useful. So it's sort of by 
immersion in a woman-run situation and working in

14:02.976 --> 14:29.502
the rape crisis center and reading psychology of 
women articles that were just beginning to come

14:02.976 --> 14:29.502
out at that time, looking at the issue of sex 
differences and finding there really aren't that

14:02.976 --> 14:29.502
many, realizing that a lot of this role had been 
hoisted on a woman by brainwashing, cultural

14:02.976 --> 14:29.502
brainwashing, and that it wasn't really 
inherent. So I decided that women's issues would

14:29.482 --> 14:50.983
probably be my focus, and as I applied for graduate 
school in my senior year, what I hoped to do was to

14:29.482 --> 14:50.983
get into a program where I could do my master's 
thesis and doctoral work on psychology of women,

14:29.482 --> 14:50.983
and particularly what interested me was therapy 
for women, and what kinds of therapy would help

14:29.482 --> 14:50.983
women to kind of throw off their social role and 
develop themselves more as full individuals. So I

14:57.358 --> 15:01.147
had started to read some of the beginning work in 
feminist therapy. Is that how you came to be

15:02.390 --> 15:06.981
interested in sexual therapy? Well, kind of by 
mistake, actually. When I got to graduate school,

15:09.167 --> 15:15.773
there was no one on the faculty who was doing 
psychology of women. There was only one female

15:16.133 --> 15:20.857
faculty member out of 15, and she worked with 
autistic children. And I don't like children. I

15:23.300 --> 15:26.402
don't like to work with children. That was the last 
thing in the world I wanted anything to do with. And

15:29.846 --> 15:31.607
no one was doing feminist stuff. I was interested 
in consciousness-raising groups, and did those

15:31.867 --> 15:35.791
have a therapeutic effect? And I wanted to test 
that. No one was doing that. There was a woman in

15:38.898 --> 15:46.063
another department who was the head of women's 
studies, but she was already overcommitted, and

15:38.898 --> 15:46.063
she couldn't take me on. And that felt like a 
crushing blow that They just wasn't a mentor for me

15:49.047 --> 15:51.110
in my area. So I asked around in the psych 
department and found that there was a researcher

15:51.771 --> 16:02.105
in the clinical area who did sex research and he 
wanted someone to do sex research on women. And his

16:02.125 --> 16:07.613
student that he had been a mentor for had gone on and 
finished her doctorate and he had a opening for

16:07.593 --> 16:30.057
another student so i talked with him and i decided 
to work with him since sexuality was always

16:07.593 --> 16:30.057
interesting to me and i felt that women were 
oppressed in many ways sexually and that we had a

16:07.593 --> 16:30.057
lot to learn about female sexuality and i thought i 
could integrate my interest in feminism and women

16:07.593 --> 16:30.057
psycho woman with sexuality so i would not have 
thought of that field right off the bat it It had

16:30.796 --> 16:37.004
always been an interesting area to me, but I'd 
never thought of myself as going into sex

16:30.796 --> 16:37.004
research. But once I got in, I realized that the 
potential for working as a feminist sex

16:37.024 --> 16:45.155
researcher was very high, that I could do a lot. And 
plus, I then became fascinated by the field, that

16:45.175 --> 16:51.623
it's just, to me now, an inherently fascinating 
field. Did today's research in sexual behavior,

16:51.603 --> 17:06.625
human sexual behavior, how has that field of study 
helped deteriorate the myths of of the

17:06.605 --> 17:10.009
inequalities between men and women? Well, some of 
the physiological research has shown that women

17:10.029 --> 17:16.478
can become sexually aroused as easily and as 
quickly as men. That if you look at how long it takes

17:16.918 --> 17:23.287
for women to reach orgasm on their own, it's just as 
quick as men. So this myth that women take longer,

17:23.307 --> 17:29.294
you know, and that they're less sexual has been 
disproven. It's really whether they're getting

17:29.475 --> 17:33.079
adequate stimulation or not from their partners. 
And unfortunately, a lot of Men in our culture have

17:35.444 --> 17:43.695
not yet been educated enough to know how to be a 
lover, a good lover, to women. And women

17:43.715 --> 17:47.800
themselves have not felt entitled to speak up 
about what they want. Some of the other research

17:48.381 --> 18:00.377
has resulted in women becoming more aware of their 
bodies and how their bodies work and so that

17:48.381 --> 18:00.377
they're more able to communicate and less ashamed 
of their sexuality than women used to be. But I

18:00.577 --> 18:02.059
think we have a long way to go. So in dealing with 
sexual therapy, I would imagine that you would

18:02.866 --> 18:13.028
come across many studies dealing with 
relationships and the roles that men and women do

18:02.866 --> 18:13.028
play in them. So I would imagine that, would that 
also be, contribute to deteriorating the

18:13.261 --> 18:20.290
socialization? Yeah, in addition to the 
physiological end of the research, the research

18:20.310 --> 18:34.088
that we know we have known in relationships shows 
how important communication is and how important

18:20.310 --> 18:34.088
affectionate touching is to women, 
particularly. and how important equality is in a

18:34.068 --> 18:49.073
relationship for marital and sexual happiness, 
that there is research showing that women are most

18:34.068 --> 18:49.073
highly sexually satisfied when they're in 
egalitarian relationships, plus they're more

18:34.068 --> 18:49.073
satisfied and happy in the relationship anyway. 
And those things tend to go together for women,

18:50.235 --> 18:58.489
that it's very hard for women to be sexually happy 
if they are not emotionally happy in the

18:50.235 --> 18:58.489
relationship, because those things are very 
connected. You were saying that you try to

18:59.566 --> 19:12.163
incorporate some of your feminist viewpoints 
into human sexual behaviors in psychology. I was

19:12.303 --> 19:15.447
wondering how would you define feminism? To me, 
it's the right to be treated equally to men and to

19:16.608 --> 19:27.042
have all the same advantages and privileges and 
opportunities. in our culture and our society.

19:29.261 --> 19:29.722
But men do. Equal opportunity. Yeah. Okay. There 
was a book, I don't know if you read it since you were

19:34.572 --> 19:44.153
talking about reading about early books 
published by women about studies dealing with

19:34.572 --> 19:44.153
women's roles. It was called Betty Freedom, The 
Feminine Mystique. In her book, she makes a

19:49.179 --> 19:53.345
comparison between a woman's role in the house. 
She makes a comparison between the American

19:54.105 --> 19:59.392
household and a concentration camp. It's pretty 
radical. But I was wondering, how do you feel, how

20:04.058 --> 20:10.226
has that role changed? Hmm. For Dan's book, it 
actually came out when I was a little kid, I think in

20:12.668 --> 20:21.799
the early 60s, and I did read it later in my 20s as an 
historical work. And I don't remember that

20:22.401 --> 20:23.746
comparison. I think... Some things have changed 
about that role, and some things have not. A lot

20:28.598 --> 20:32.644
more women, half of all women now, I think, work 
outside the home. Half of all mothers work outside

20:33.045 --> 20:34.827
the home. And so women are not constrained as much 
to just having that one source of reinforcement,

20:35.448 --> 20:43.982
which isn't much of a source of reinforcement. The 
problem with House being a homemaker

20:44.002 --> 20:49.851
traditionally has been that the work is 
invisible. No one comes around and compliments

20:49.911 --> 20:52.495
you or acknowledges you. It's unpaid. No one gives 
you bonuses or pay raises. It's isolated in that

20:57.351 --> 20:59.514
you're working alone. You're not working with 
other people. And it's repetitive because every

21:01.656 --> 21:07.583
time, every day, the dishes have to be done again 
and the laundry has to be done again. So there isn't

21:07.663 --> 21:12.409
a sense of completion and having a product, a 
finished product at the end. It's just repetitive

21:12.529 --> 21:14.772
work. And recognition

21:15.410 --> 21:29.149
for their work.

21:29.332 --> 21:29.873
etc. The problem is that women end up usually then 
doing twice as much work and there's a book that's

21:30.173 --> 21:49.893
written by a sociologist named Arlen Hauschild 
called The Second Shift and it talks about how

21:30.173 --> 21:49.893
women often work full-time jobs and then they come 
home and do 80% of the housework and child care if

21:30.173 --> 21:49.893
not more and get very little assistance. So in some 
ways that hasn't changed because working two

21:50.254 --> 21:55.860
shifts is not exactly liberation. How do you 
foresee that role changing in the future or do you I

22:00.112 --> 22:02.054
hope it will change. I feel like I have good 
predictive powers. Women, I think, need to insist

22:06.017 --> 22:16.246
that men help them with their housework, and men 
need to be socialized to view this as part of their

22:06.017 --> 22:16.246
normal activities as well. Parents bringing 
children up need to hopefully raise boys and girls

22:17.107 --> 22:27.236
to feel that they'll be equal partners and take 
equal responsibility for all things in a

22:17.107 --> 22:27.236
relationship. And this is going to be a long-term 
change, I'm sure. But I think that for the short

22:30.031 --> 22:39.827
term, women in relationships are just going to 
have to demand that this person that they're with

22:30.031 --> 22:39.827
help them, not do the work themselves. On the issue 
of equality between women and women, it brings me

22:42.191 --> 22:49.744
to the subject of now. The National Organization 
of Women. And I was wondering how, I know you've

22:52.820 --> 22:58.169
done research on pornography. Is this movement 
active on the pornography issue? Actually, now

23:03.659 --> 23:08.948
it's split on that issue as are most other feminist 
organizations. There is a platform in now, a

23:09.485 --> 23:23.062
position that pornography is oppressive to 
women, and where they're split is whether or not to

23:09.485 --> 23:23.062
support the legislation, the model 
anti-pornography ordinance proposed by Dworkin

23:09.485 --> 23:23.062
and McKinnon. Another way that they're split is in 
terms of where now is placing its priorities. I had

23:31.032 --> 23:39.323
a chance to talk with the president of now this last 
August, Joel Ireland, who came to the Texas Now

23:39.674 --> 24:03.917
conference in Beaumont and had lunch, I got to have 
lunch with her and a group of activists from Texas

23:39.674 --> 24:03.917
and I asked her about the pornography issue 
specifically and what about Now's platform and

23:39.674 --> 24:03.917
what are they going to be doing and she said, well, 
you know, it's an important issue and I do think

23:39.674 --> 24:03.917
it's harmful but we've got a lot of other things 
cooking right now that I think are more important

23:39.674 --> 24:03.917
to women such as abortion rights and I totally 
agree with her. I mean, that's been, pornography

24:04.057 --> 24:08.922
has been my area of research for a long time and it's 
an area I care about and feel strongly about. But in

24:11.416 --> 24:24.674
women's day-to-day existence, if we have to 
decide which battles we're going to fight

24:11.416 --> 24:24.674
politically, I'm supportive of now fighting to 
keep freedom of choice in that area first and deal

24:11.416 --> 24:24.674
with the pornography later. I'll still continue 
to work in both areas. How has NOW's platform

24:28.375 --> 24:35.123
influenced legislation on reproductive rights? 
Or what are some of the... How did they move to...

24:35.384 --> 24:45.276
Did they move to make people publicly aware of the 
issue? Yeah, in a number of ways. NOW has

24:47.399 --> 24:50.903
educational presentations at the chapter level. 
Chapters are what you have in each city or town. The

24:54.287 --> 24:58.112
Texas A&M chapter is one of the local ways that now 
does educational presentations. We show films.

25:01.442 --> 25:02.223
We have discussions. We show films sometimes from 
both the anti-abortion and pro-abortion and have

25:02.283 --> 25:07.027
people discuss it. It's pretty hot sometimes. And 
in addition to education, now engages in

25:10.630 --> 25:26.125
petitions and letter writing and lobbying of 
state representatives and national senators and

25:10.630 --> 25:26.125
congresspeople. on that issue. They also have a 
legal defense and education fund, which helps

25:28.212 --> 25:45.157
provide legal and financial support to people who 
are involved in lawsuits, and I believe that now

25:28.212 --> 25:45.157
has supported several legal battles having to do 
with abortion rights. So it's active on a lot of

25:45.177 --> 25:53.749
fronts, trying to keep the option open for women to 
choose, and this is really important to

25:45.177 --> 25:53.749
understand that people are glorifying abortion 
in this movement at all or thinking about that's

25:54.016 --> 25:59.352
the best strategy of controlling pregnancy, but 
that women should have the choice. I was wondering

26:06.895 --> 26:16.904
if we could look at the feminist movements you 
point on reproductive rights and then get back to

26:06.895 --> 26:16.904
other issues that now holds. Would that be all 
right? Yeah. Okay. What are some, how does, there

26:20.066 --> 26:29.575
are two, first I would like to discuss the division 
in feminism that you were speaking of. There's a

26:29.555 --> 26:33.638
movement of radical feminism and then there's 
moderate, I believe. Is that correct? Well, yeah,

26:34.719 --> 26:38.923
there are different parts of feminists in this 
movement. Do they all hold the same viewpoint on

26:38.943 --> 26:42.466
reproductive rights? No. Yeah, they're not 
divided on most issues. Generally, there would be

26:47.330 --> 26:51.794
complete agreement on keeping abortion legal. 
What is the difference between individuals of the

26:52.154 --> 26:58.920
feminist movement today? I

26:59.525 --> 27:21.347
don't know if it's really as divided as the media 
presents it, because in general, the feminist

26:59.525 --> 27:21.347
movement is larger, now has a larger membership, 
and it's working more effectively than it ever has

26:59.525 --> 27:21.347
before to keep freedom of choice for women and to 
argue for other sexual harassment issues so it's

27:21.327 --> 27:46.457
not like a split ineffective movement and there 
actually were there was an editorial by sally

27:21.327 --> 27:46.457
quinn there's this writer for the washington post 
who said feminism is dead and we feminism isn't

27:21.327 --> 27:46.457
addressing the needs of the common women and women 
and that was like um responded to by joe ireland and

27:21.327 --> 27:46.457
people would know and basically say this is bull 
you know that feminism is going strong and you

27:21.327 --> 27:46.457
don't know what you're talking about ladies And 
it's true, it really is a big, strong movement. And

27:50.044 --> 27:52.026
there are a lot of internal splits. Historically, 
one split that was between maybe radical

27:52.046 --> 28:01.094
feminists and moderate feminists was over 
whether lesbians should be allowed to be members

27:52.046 --> 28:01.094
of NOW. And this occurred in the late 60s. Betty 
Friedan was against having lesbians be up front

28:04.477 --> 28:14.026
members of NOW and having a pro-lesbian or gay 
rights platform in NOW. She felt that that would

28:14.046 --> 28:16.748
give people more of a view that all feminists are 
lesbians, and that we couldn't afford as

28:17.082 --> 28:28.793
feminists to affiliate ourselves in this way, 
because that would lead to too much negative

28:17.082 --> 28:28.793
stereotyping. And what happened is, actually, 
there were many women in now, not the majority, but

28:29.313 --> 28:45.908
maybe a third or a fourth of the women who started 
now who were lesbians, and they felt enraged by

28:29.313 --> 28:45.908
this, and really hurt, like they had gotten the 
whole thing going, and supported Friedan, and

28:29.313 --> 28:45.908
done a lot of the work, and been out there on the 
front lines, and organized women's shelters and

28:46.225 --> 28:50.750
women's bookstores and now chapters. And then 
they were being told that they were not wanted in

28:51.270 --> 28:54.614
the organization. So they rose up and they formed 
this group called the Lavender Menace. They took

28:59.499 --> 29:04.484
over the stage at one of these conventions and they 
demanded that Nell's policy change. What

29:04.565 --> 29:13.414
happened is Nell did reject the lesbian members 
for several years and then its policy was changed

29:04.565 --> 29:13.414
and lesbians rejoin now. So predominantly the 
membership is, you know, pretty heterosexual,

29:13.799 --> 29:36.065
but there's probably maybe less than a fourth, 
maybe a tenth of the membership, or some portion,

29:13.799 --> 29:36.065
maybe no more than the population proportion, 
maybe a tenth to a fifth are lesbians, because

29:13.799 --> 29:36.065
lesbians tend to have a feminist awareness 
because they're already oppressed in terms of

29:13.799 --> 29:36.065
their sexual orientation. They also tend to share 
the value of feminism, it'd be kind of nuts not to.

29:41.944 --> 29:42.064
Right. For them not to. So that was one division, 
but that's kind of like now, you know, we have an

29:43.027 --> 29:51.433
openly bisexual president of now, Joe Ireland. 
has come out, she was brought out, but she has

29:51.667 --> 30:01.317
publicly come out as having a female lover and 
still being married to her husband, who she loves

29:51.667 --> 30:01.317
very much and has been very supportive. So, you 
know, best of both worlds, I guess. I don't know how

30:04.280 --> 30:10.807
she does it, but she's been accepted, and people 
knew this about her and voted her in anyway. So that

30:11.227 --> 30:20.897
division is by the wayside, and the only other 
division I can think of is the one over

30:11.227 --> 30:20.897
pornography, and that's not so much between 
moderate and radical feminists, because even

30:11.227 --> 30:20.897
among radical feminists, There's division. Some 
of them are saying women should have all kinds of

30:22.399 --> 30:37.033
pornography available to them, and that we are 
trying to protect women from sexuality in a way

30:22.399 --> 30:37.033
that's actually demeaning, that women are old 
enough, they're mature enough to make their own

30:22.399 --> 30:37.033
decisions, and blah, blah, blah. And we don't want 
the government to censor more materials. And then

30:41.177 --> 30:43.740
the other group is the Dworkin McKinnon group. But 
that's really a split throughout. all feminists

30:46.358 --> 30:49.583
about what to do with pornography. So I wouldn't 
characterize there really being a radical

30:49.783 --> 30:55.751
feminist versus moderate feminist split. Do you 
feel that the feminist viewpoint on pornography

30:55.771 --> 31:04.884
will be given legislative attention as has been 
done in Canada now? Eventually, I think it will.

31:07.216 --> 31:14.085
I've been asked to present at a conference coming 
up in March at the University of Chicago Law

31:07.216 --> 31:14.085
School, and thanks. Dworkin's going to be there, 
McKinnon's going to be there, and these are people

31:14.646 --> 31:21.495
I know and I've met, but it's just going to be by kind 
of a think tank. All of the activists who've worked

31:21.896 --> 31:29.005
in this area and scientists and researchers are 
going to be there and trying to talk about, all

31:21.896 --> 31:29.005
right, what strategy to take next. And Anita Hill 
is going to be there. She's going to be one of those

31:30.908 --> 31:32.189
speakers. That's going to be interesting. Oh, 
it's just going to be a dynamite conference. So I

31:35.794 --> 31:41.682
think after that conference, people are going to 
sort of figure out where to go next with this. But

31:41.823 --> 31:49.713
definitely the Canadian precedent is something 
that people are going to take and try to encourage

31:41.823 --> 31:49.713
to happen in the United States. I'd say it probably 
will take at least another 10 years, at least. It's

31:53.116 --> 31:57.463
a very hard fight because there's so many economic 
interests. And I mentioned in class that the

31:57.483 --> 32:13.709
American Booksellers Association, which is 
Hastings and Wallen Books and all these huge

31:57.483 --> 32:13.709
corporations who profit from selling magazines, 
pornography magazines, don't want any control on

31:57.483 --> 32:13.709
that stuff because they'll lose millions of 
dollars in profits. So they're funding the battle

32:13.729 --> 32:16.493
against. It's not just pornographers. It's like 
anybody else who benefits from it. I was going to

32:21.179 --> 32:28.690
ask you about NOW and the correlation between NOW 
and the feminist movement. Is NOW the only tool

32:28.710 --> 32:33.737
that the feminist movement has? No, it's the 
largest national organization, but there's

32:34.178 --> 32:39.946
another one that Ellie Smeal started. She was a 
former president of NOW, two presidents ago. She

32:43.271 --> 32:50.562
started an organization called Feminist 
Majority, which funds candidates for office.

32:50.997 --> 32:58.340
women candidates and actually helped fund a lot of 
the women who ran for senator and representative

32:50.997 --> 32:58.340
this time around. And she believes, Ellie 
believes that The only way women are going to

33:01.730 --> 33:07.256
really be able to change the system is to get 
elected to office. We've got to put priority on

33:07.516 --> 33:09.218
that. So there's that organization. Many people 
are members of both. I think I'm a member of both. I

33:13.742 --> 33:16.826
know I'm a member of now, and I think I've paid my 
dues to the other one this year. There's also

33:18.007 --> 33:25.915
specific abortion rights groups like National 
Abortion Rights Action League, NERA. that's

33:26.333 --> 33:31.017
focused on just, you know, keeping abortion 
legal, and there are state divisions of that.

33:31.037 --> 33:35.521
There's Terol, which is a Texas abortion rights 
action league. Other feminist groups... There's

33:38.544 --> 33:48.032
another one that's just started called the Third 
Party or something, and it's like to get a third

33:38.544 --> 33:48.032
political party that would be more responsive to 
the needs of women in minority groups. I think

33:48.373 --> 33:51.295
that's another separate feminist organization. 
But now it's really the biggest. Okay. Um... What

33:55.544 --> 34:04.626
got you interested in teaching sexual behaviors?

34:07.576 --> 34:14.042
Just in, I guess it wasn't an interest, it was my 
role when I applied to be a tenure track professor.

34:14.062 --> 34:25.614
I'd already, I'd been allowed to teach some 
courses as an assistant professor who was

34:14.062 --> 34:25.614
visiting, but I hadn't taught the sex course yet 
because the person I was working with, who was my

34:14.062 --> 34:25.614
senior, taught the sexuality course here. And so I 
just, it was part of the role I was hired for to teach

34:25.634 --> 34:33.181
that particular course. And I knew immediately 
that it would be a wonderful course to teach. And

34:37.208 --> 34:55.666
the challenge for me was to teach it in a way that 
gave the students the basic information that's in

34:37.208 --> 34:55.666
the text, but also gave them more of a critical 
awareness that this isn't the only information,

34:37.208 --> 34:55.666
that there are different points of view, that this 
is still a social construct that we need to be aware

34:37.208 --> 34:55.666
of, the point of view of the researchers. And it's 
hard to do that with an undergraduate class,

34:55.686 --> 35:01.672
because it would be easy to talk about people's 
heads. But it seems to me the students really do get

35:02.072 --> 35:05.916
the idea after a while. understand why some of the 
readings are there. The only way to do that is to

35:09.401 --> 35:17.192
have this huge amount of reading, to have the 
textbook and to have these articles which give

35:09.401 --> 35:17.192
different points of view on the side. Do you feel 
more in any way gratified that you're doing, that

35:18.133 --> 35:30.891
you are educating undergraduate students on this 
subject in what has been a traditional

35:18.133 --> 35:30.891
conservative school? Yeah, I really do. I didn't 
think about that when I started, but I really soon

35:32.434 --> 35:57.148
became aware that the person who teaches that sort 
of a course, probably anywhere, but especially

35:32.434 --> 35:57.148
maybe a place like Texas A&M, that they're 
addressing a need for information that has not

35:32.434 --> 35:57.148
been addressed for many of these students before, 
and that so many of the students in my classes come

35:32.434 --> 35:57.148
and talk to me after class, or they'll come in and 
shut the door, and they'll say, right, this

35:57.128 --> 36:26.646
happened to me or I have a question and they've 
never been able to ask anybody before and I realize

35:57.128 --> 36:26.646
that there is an atmosphere of trust that happens 
in that class and that's very important and that I

35:57.128 --> 36:26.646
can help individual students as well as teaching 
these ideas and in terms of challenging

35:57.128 --> 36:26.646
traditional beliefs I do think that the class 
succeeds in doing that and that it opens people to a

35:57.128 --> 36:26.646
different point of view that I don't think that 
they would have gotten exposure to I know if I was

36:26.795 --> 36:39.454
teaching this course in New York or California 
where I'm from, I would just sort of be like, oh,

36:26.795 --> 36:39.454
yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, we know that, and I 
would just sort of be like, you know, like a lot of

36:26.795 --> 36:39.454
other profs there, and the students would They're 
not all completely educated and liberated, but

36:39.957 --> 36:43.402
they would have more of an idea. And now here I feel 
almost like a missionary in a strange place. I'm

36:48.590 --> 36:54.900
speaking these things like, oh, women have equal 
rights, and people are all freaked out. And I'm

36:54.920 --> 36:57.283
saying, no, women are sexual too. And I can see some 
of the guys shifting around going, women aren't

36:57.484 --> 37:01.970
sexual. We're just supposed to lie there. And I 
don't think anyone would say that, but... I think

37:07.447 --> 37:13.997
that some people come in with those kinds of 
attitudes, and I can tell that people are thinking

37:07.447 --> 37:13.997
a lot about the course. And I've had students come 
up to me later, like years later, and say, wow, that

37:14.017 --> 37:22.269
course was really a good course, and it really made 
me think, and it's really helped me in my

37:14.017 --> 37:22.269
relationships. And that's important to me. In a 
nutshell, what would you say your teaching

37:24.973 --> 37:31.322
strategy was for the class? What is the class 
about?

37:37.923 --> 38:04.977
The goal of the course, the objective, is to help 
students to have a critical understanding of

37:37.923 --> 38:04.977
sexuality, meaning an understanding of how 
sexuality is created in our society, where it

37:37.923 --> 38:04.977
comes from, where our ideas and beliefs come from, 
and a greater appreciation for the malleability

37:37.923 --> 38:04.977
of sexuality, that even if you're brought up in a 
certain way, that there are many other people who

38:05.260 --> 38:08.946
believe very differently. And maybe an 
understanding of cultural differences and an

38:09.246 --> 38:26.432
appreciation for people who are different 
sexually, like gay and lesbian individuals, an

38:09.246 --> 38:26.432
understanding of people who are gender 
dysphoric, rather than just a condemnation or

38:09.246 --> 38:26.432
prejudice, to understand what might make 
somebody feel this way. So I guess creating

38:27.874 --> 38:34.204
greater awareness and understanding of 
sexuality for themselves and for their people.

38:34.690 --> 38:37.693
You said you have your doctorate in clinical 
psychology. Have you

38:38.173 --> 38:47.502
ever... Have you ever been a sexual therapist? 
Yes. Yeah, I do have a part-time private practice.

38:49.604 --> 38:51.926
I see about eight clients a week. Okay. While 
you're teaching. Yeah. Wow. And I like to do

38:56.310 --> 38:57.891
clinical work. I don't know if I'd want to do it 
full-time with people coming in and out every hour

38:57.971 --> 39:02.796
on the hour. But... I really feel that's important 
so that I can be a better teacher, and especially

39:04.812 --> 39:15.842
for graduate students who I teach actually how to 
do therapy, for me to be doing it and still have my

39:04.812 --> 39:15.842
hand in it is pretty important. So yeah, I have done 
that since when in graduate school you start

39:16.383 --> 39:32.878
training as a therapist and seeing clients that in 
your second year, so since age 23, and I'm 38 now,

39:16.383 --> 39:32.878
and I started seeing sex cases four years into 
graduate school, so I was like about 26 or 27. 26

39:33.432 --> 39:36.396
when I started to see sex cases. And so I've been 
carrying cases like that ever since. I see other

39:40.362 --> 39:41.544
types as well. You know, I don't just treat sexual 
dysfunctions. But that's definitely like my area

39:44.288 --> 39:48.755
of specialization, that and women's issues. I'd 
imagine that that field in itself that that sex

39:52.990 --> 39:58.196
therapy has greatly expanded throughout the 70s, 
80s, 90s. Yeah, yeah, it's definitely grown as a

39:58.937 --> 40:02.080
field. Although in this town, I am the only really 
highly trained person in that area. There are a few

40:07.306 --> 40:17.257
people who have taken a few seminars and they do sex 
therapy and they advertise as sex therapists in

40:07.306 --> 40:17.257
the Yellow Pages, but I don't think they're really 
highly trained. So it is kind of a specialty. Do you

40:20.902 --> 40:31.235
feel that you have, so far, achieved your goal to 
make people socially aware of the equality

40:20.902 --> 40:31.235
between men and women? It's hard to know. From what 
some students and people tell me after I give a

40:34.519 --> 40:46.133
slide presentation on pornography, I get the 
impression that it's making a difference. I know

40:46.349 --> 40:51.555
that last year what NOW did to help support the 
female cadets has made a difference. For a while, I

40:52.256 --> 41:10.197
think that the women cadets were under scrutiny 
and felt things were worse, but from what I have

40:52.256 --> 41:10.197
heard from a few of them, there are less incidents 
than there used to be, that it's not perfect, but

40:52.256 --> 41:10.197
people are a lot more careful about the way they're 
treating women and minorities there, and they've

40:52.256 --> 41:10.197
gotten this big lecture on sexual harassment and 
It's probably way far away from perfect, but I have

41:10.919 --> 41:16.407
a feeling they just can't get away with the same 
amount of crap. And so to me, that's effective

41:16.927 --> 41:19.150
social change. It may make the life of a few women 
better in the core. Hopefully. If it didn't, then

41:24.678 --> 41:26.861
I'd be really upset. That was the intention. I 
guess in conclusion, I would like to ask you what

41:29.805 --> 41:40.740
you think is the main tool that the feminist 
movement should use and has been using with

41:40.923 --> 41:42.525
Education. Power. Basically, making political 
change means acquiring enough power to do so. And

41:51.718 --> 41:55.664
that means getting women elected into political 
office. It means getting women in academia and

41:55.684 --> 42:02.053
keeping them in academia and pushing the system to 
do that. having women physicians, like now, there

42:02.371 --> 42:13.191
are more women OBGYNs, so women aren't getting 
treated as atrociously as they have been for many,

42:02.371 --> 42:13.191
many years. It's beginning to change, to do 
everything to support women to really take on

42:13.752 --> 42:22.909
equal participation in all roles, particularly 
leadership roles. Okay. Well, is there any

42:24.022 --> 42:26.726
personal note you'd like to add? No. I wonder if I 
disappointed you in terms of why I got into sex

42:27.327 --> 42:30.592
research. It was just sort of serendipitous that 
there was nothing in my family that, you know, made

42:30.612 --> 42:36.260
me decide to do this. No.

42:39.926 --> 42:50.842
But I really think, too, that education is very 
powerful in itself to help bring about the lens of

42:39.926 --> 42:50.842
change, so to speak. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. 
Okay. Well, thank you very much. You're welcome.

42:55.179 --> 42:58.315
It's always fun to talk about yourself.
