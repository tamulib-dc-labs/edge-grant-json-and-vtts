This is Wednesday, June the 13th, and I am in the 
Kleberg building and have the honor and pleasure

00:32.802 --> 01:01.206
of interviewing Dr. Harry Kunkel, a splendid 
colleague and distinguished faculty member and

00:32.802 --> 01:01.206
administrator here, about his experience, 
experiences, after he came back following his

00:32.802 --> 01:01.206
student days here. Harry, after you graduated 
from A&M, briefly describe what happened to you,

01:01.760 --> 01:12.330
your experiences between graduation and when you 
came back here as an employee.

01:17.075 --> 01:26.964
We immediately volunteered for immediate 
induction and went down to Houston two days after

01:17.075 --> 01:26.964
we graduated. I didn't even go home. And 
graduation was when, what year? January 25th or

01:31.645 --> 01:34.688
something of that sort. 1940. 1943. 43. And

01:36.991 --> 01:54.210
we all became in the Army and within a week we got 
notice that we had to report for duty and those who

01:36.991 --> 01:54.210
were in the artillery ended up at Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma in the Officer Candidate School. And

01:54.983 --> 02:08.388
there were a group of Aggies in that officer 
candidate school, and we all went, most of us went

01:54.983 --> 02:08.388
through together and were commissioned in May 
1943 and went from there to various places.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.191
Where'd you go? I went to the 65th Division in Camp 
Shelby, Mississippi and joined the situation.

02:20.254 --> 02:23.718
But that was the first of my problems. I was 
carrying a man piggyback and exercise and I broke a

02:24.559 --> 02:39.115
leg and spent essentially a whole year in medical 
situation in the Army and recovery. After that, I

02:39.955 --> 02:41.557
was a casual. That meant I was unassigned to any 
unit particularly. And most of the time was in

02:46.824 --> 02:55.636
Jackson, Mississippi and Fort Sill, Oklahoma. 
And then after that, I,

02:56.437 --> 03:07.212
as a casual,

02:56.437 --> 03:07.212
was sent to the Pacific I was given a, I'd been in 
long enough to get an automatic promotion to first

03:09.267 --> 03:19.959
lieutenant because the time and grade was there.

03:23.524 --> 03:30.752
Eventually spent 50, well, went across the 
Pacific in a troop ship. I was in command of 269

03:31.120 --> 03:40.556
black African Americans, which was an 
interesting observation, just for thinking.

03:40.796 --> 03:42.579
Mostly from what part of the country? They were all 
over the country. I didn't specifically. Became

03:48.308 --> 03:49.590
friends with some of them. Infantry? Well, they 
went into various places. I only ran into one or two

03:57.007 --> 03:59.250
after later on. Then I was a casual in the 
Philippines right after Manila was taken and got

03:59.911 --> 04:20.378
to go out and see Corregidor with all the Japanese 
skulls still lying around and the place

03:59.911 --> 04:20.378
completely scorched with flames and things of the 
sort. And from that point I was assigned to the

04:21.018 --> 04:26.085
Americal Division This was the only unnumbered 
division in the United States Army.

04:33.110 --> 04:35.132
Why was it unnumbered? Well, it started largely 
with a group of units from the National Guard. I

04:43.561 --> 04:45.403
see. And they assembled in New Caledonia, and so 
they called it Americans in New Caledonia, a very

04:46.004 --> 04:52.731
Cal division. The patch was the Southern Cross, 
blue on blue. I stayed with them, and one evening we

05:01.027 --> 05:08.315
were in Cebu. We

05:08.335 --> 05:22.431
had an officer's class, and we walked out of the 
officer's class and down in the enlistment

05:08.335 --> 05:22.431
situation, all heck was breaking loose. Japan had 
surrendered.

05:28.205 --> 05:32.952
So we went in as part of the Army of Occupation. And 
the units that I transferred to went all the way up

05:32.972 --> 05:51.000
to the northern end of Honshu, across Honshu in 
several units, including the 1st Cavalry

05:32.972 --> 05:51.000
Division. How did the civilian population of 
Japan react to you Americans?

06:03.651 --> 06:06.195
When we first drove through the streets of 
Oklahoma, they hid. They were out of sight. And I

06:12.084 --> 06:19.215
boldly sat up in the back of a jeep and looked around 
and looked for them and things of the sort. So no one

06:19.718 --> 06:23.147
said anything, did, threw anything? No, didn't do 
anything. And we generally began to get closer and

06:24.911 --> 06:36.580
you'd go in for a conference and the first thing you 
would do would hear the hissing sound, which is

06:24.911 --> 06:36.580
their greeting. Oh, that's a positive. Yes. Okay. 
Yeah, it's a greeting that the Japanese used at

06:41.554 --> 06:45.760
that particular time. Let's back up just a second. 
Do you remember where the circumstances under

06:49.005 --> 06:56.015
which you and your colleagues heard about the 
first A-bomb being dropped? Well, we were in Cebu

06:56.836 --> 07:00.281
Island. What was the reaction? I think it was 
pretty quiet. Well, okay, they deserved it. We

07:05.875 --> 07:07.156
were fighting the battle. Our unit was

07:07.957 --> 07:14.883
destined to go in in D-4. That's four days before 
the main invasion. We were destined to go into

07:18.345 --> 07:31.997
Kyoto as a diversionary end of things while the 
major attack was going to be in and around Honshu.

07:31.977 --> 07:40.386
Tokyo,

07:31.977 --> 07:40.386
I suspect, in a particular area. We traveled from 
Cebu to Yokohama, and we were in the Tokyo Bay at the

07:40.466 --> 07:54.640
same time the Japanese were on Missouri 
surrendering. But we didn't see it.

08:00.800 --> 08:08.468
Did that make any change in the civilian 
population in Japan, that ceremony? I suspect it

08:10.631 --> 08:11.792
did. Of course, I didn't know them. They were 
generally, you expected the Japanese to be

08:14.535 --> 08:26.908
vicious kinds of people in their fighting, and 
they were pretty calm.

08:29.318 --> 08:30.540
and accepted us. We had no particular difficulty. 
We generally walked around with a pistol in our

08:33.103 --> 08:36.629
holster. All right, then you're in the occupation 
force, and then what after that? Well, I came home

08:44.039 --> 08:48.305
and was released in June. Of 46. 46. And I 
immediately came back to Texas A&M and got an

08:53.513 --> 08:58.380
assistantship in animal husbandry with going for 
the degree of animal nutrition. And what was your

09:04.767 --> 09:06.610
career goal at that point? Were you hoping to be a 
faculty member? I was going to become a faculty

09:08.812 --> 09:10.574
member. I just at that point I had run in my 
undergraduate career I had run across Paul

09:10.594 --> 09:22.208
Pearson who

09:10.594 --> 09:22.208
I treasured, and I made contact with him 
immediately after it, and he offered me an

09:22.643 --> 09:31.116
assistantship sight unseen, I guess, or he knew 
me.

09:37.946 --> 09:44.837
What did that assistantship include? Oh, it 
included the opportunity to do research and

09:49.812 --> 09:52.636
seventy-five dollars a month. Now I was rich 
because you see the yeah the GI Bill at the GI Bill

09:54.398 --> 10:07.737
and

09:54.398 --> 10:07.737
the

10:11.092 --> 10:15.242
with the $75 in assistantship. That added up to 300 
bucks a month, and 300 bucks a month was something

10:15.522 --> 10:21.937
in those days. And you began that when? In 
September 1946. Oh, so pretty soon after you got

10:28.147 --> 10:31.092
out. It was immediately. I was offered several 
jobs in my hometown, but I decided I was going to go

10:32.394 --> 10:38.122
back. And where did you live here that first fall? I 
lived in the dormitory, one of the newer

10:41.868 --> 10:46.135
dormitories over here. Was everything filled up 
in the fall of 46? Yes. And you old veterans, I'll

10:53.937 --> 10:58.184
bet, dominated the campus numerically. We 
dominated the campus because the young people

10:58.204 --> 11:07.481
hadn't come back and the military was small at that 
particular point. Military component was small.

11:10.085 --> 11:14.733
What were your duties as assistant other than to do 
research? That was it. I had a research

11:15.615 --> 11:17.498
assistantship. Were you to work on his project, or 
could you do your own? Well, basically it was his

11:22.419 --> 11:24.141
project. He had a grant to work on magnesium, the 
nutrition of magnesium. And so I began to

11:30.190 --> 11:34.596
essentially work in that particular area. And 
then in February, January 1948, with a master's

11:41.153 --> 11:50.173
degree in hand, I went up to Cornell where I had an 
assistantship, $125 there a month. And the GI

11:50.514 --> 11:51.416
Bill. And the GI Bill. And what was your research 
topic up there? Well, there I was pretty much on my

11:58.940 --> 12:08.940
own, which actually I did a subject on linoleic 
acid and its oxidation. Linoleic. Linoleic acid.

12:12.527 --> 12:12.747
Spell that. l-i-n-o-l-e-i-c

12:13.098 --> 12:36.591
linoleic acid it's an 18 carbon two double bond 
fatty acid with the two double bonds interrupted

12:13.098 --> 12:36.591
with a methylene group ch group two ch2 group and it 
becomes and it's an unstable situation and can be

12:13.098 --> 12:36.591
easily oxidized and I worked with trying to 
isolate an enzyme called lipoxidase and work with

12:36.571 --> 12:54.676
colors such as Bixen to see whether or not it could 
operate on that particular situation. And what

12:54.696 --> 12:57.900
varieties of animals did this mix? None. This 
wasn't bovine? No, it wasn't bovine or animals.

13:05.950 --> 13:12.538
How did Cornell compare in your experiences there 
to what you had known here at A&M? Describe Cornell

13:12.558 --> 13:14.561
at that era. Well, Cornell

13:14.581 --> 13:19.527
was an established institution. Texas A&M, from a 
graduate standpoint, was fairly new, was

13:20.648 --> 13:29.359
extremely new at that particular point and young. 
Well, you know, at the time I graduated, the first,

13:29.930 --> 13:37.462
second, and third PhDs graduated in 1943. So you 
can imagine 1946, they didn't have many PhDs

13:40.066 --> 13:44.634
graduating. And so it wasn't until about 1948, 49, 
50 that they began to turn out PhDs at this

13:45.415 --> 13:52.907
institution. Are you saying the first PhDs in the 
institution? in the institution. Oh, not just in

13:56.834 --> 13:58.698
animal science. No, no. The second and third PhDs 
at Texas A&M College were graduated in 1943, the

13:59.499 --> 14:08.636
same time I got my baccalaureate degree. And one of 
them was R.E. Patterson. The other was Van Little.

14:18.682 --> 14:23.627
who were the history of Texas A&M was involved in. 
Up at Cornell, how well prepared did you find

14:25.630 --> 14:37.262
yourself with your A&M background compared to the 
other graduate students you encountered? No, I

14:37.282 --> 14:38.183
had no problem. I was prepared.

14:42.475 --> 14:44.278
Went there with a great deal of confidence. My 
major professor was James B. Sumner,

14:44.378 --> 14:51.651
S-U-M-N-E-R, who won the Nobel Prize in 1946. And I 
really wished that I had been able to work closer

14:51.771 --> 15:06.998
with him, but somehow I was a person that went off on 
my own and probably would have had a better

14:51.771 --> 15:06.998
treatment as far as this is concerned. My 
committee consisted of James, Dr. Sumner, Dr.

15:07.670 --> 15:21.294
Jack Loosley, an animal husbandry, I guess, 
animal nutrition then, and Dr. H.H. Dukes, who is a

15:21.435 --> 15:26.203
legendary physiologist in veterinary medicine. 
How big was the doctoral program in the

15:27.505 --> 15:30.150
department? I guess they had 20 or so students as 
far as the doctoral program was concerned. As they

15:38.151 --> 15:42.197
would define it, was it in biochemistry or animal 
science? It was biochemistry. I took a degree in

15:43.519 --> 15:45.522
biochemistry. And you finished up when? I 
finished up in 1950.

15:55.075 --> 15:56.577
And did you stay up there until then? I stayed up 
there till then and in June 1950 I hauled back down

15:57.383 --> 16:19.003
to Texas because I had a post-doctorate 
appointment at the University of Wisconsin

15:57.383 --> 16:19.003
Department of Biochemistry and I went back on up 
and June the 1st 1946 I became a member of the

15:57.383 --> 16:19.003
faculty as an instructor in the Department of 
Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin. Now you

16:23.651 --> 16:25.555
said 46, you meant 50? 50. 50. Yeah, 1950. And how 
did Wisconsin compare with Cornell and here? As

16:36.247 --> 16:49.779
far as biochemistry was concerned, you have to 
recognize that the Department of Biochemistry in

16:36.247 --> 16:49.779
the latter part of the 1950s was turning out 
one-third of the PhDs in biochemistry in the

16:36.247 --> 16:49.779
United States. Wisconsin? Wisconsin, I'm sorry. 
Wow. And I, of course, had my doctorate there and

16:53.020 --> 16:59.107
was on the staff. And they did a lot of inbreeding as 
far as that's concerned. As a matter of fact, they

17:03.211 --> 17:07.035
said, what year did you get your PhD at Wisconsin? I 
didn't do that. And how did you get on the faculty

17:08.116 --> 17:12.121
here? But I had a good time. And then one cold day, 
temperature dropped to 42 below zero.

17:24.273 --> 17:31.063
I got a call from Texas A&M University offering me a 
job that September, and I said, I'll take it. And

17:33.066 --> 17:35.791
you had not sought it? There was no- Well, I was 
nominated, and it was indicated, yes, I would be

17:36.392 --> 17:43.442
interested in the job. But they had, rather than, 
you see, I have a strange situation. I have never

17:49.672 --> 17:52.997
taken a job for which I interviewed. I've never 
interviewed for the job that I've taken.

18:00.136 --> 18:03.224
And you were to begin then here when? September 
1951. Okay, now this is the only money question

18:06.173 --> 18:10.497
we're going to ask about pay at Texas A&M. What was 
your beginning compensation as a faculty member?

18:14.460 --> 18:27.152
My beginning compensation as a faculty member at a 
12-month basis was $5,200, and it was the highest

18:14.460 --> 18:27.152
paid assistant professor in the university at 
that time. And compared to other institutions and

18:28.573 --> 18:34.358
their salaries, how did that compare? As far as you 
knew. As far as my salary was concerned, it was

18:35.752 --> 18:42.462
pretty favorable because although as an 
instructor, I came out of a $4,800 salary. And you,

18:43.964 --> 18:53.338
when you came back, you were a member of, describe 
the department that you... All right, there were

18:43.964 --> 18:53.338
two departments at that particular point in time. 
See, in 1947,

18:58.317 --> 19:06.246
The Department of... See, I came here in the fall of 
1946 as a graduate student in animal nutrition. In

19:07.588 --> 19:24.848
September 1947, the Department of Biochemistry 
and Nutrition was created, and I transferred so

19:07.588 --> 19:24.848
that my master's degree is in biochemistry and 
nutrition, one of the first three that was given,

19:07.588 --> 19:24.848
as far as Texas A&M is concerned. So you came back to 
that department. Well, so I, then I was in that

19:28.131 --> 19:32.858
department, and so I knew the department. It had 
about eight faculty people, and they had about

19:32.878 --> 19:41.609
eight faculty people when I returned in 1951. Who 
was the department head? Carl Lyman. Please

19:44.553 --> 19:45.695
describe him. Make believe I didn't know him or 
anything about him. Describe him as... Carl Lyman

19:47.778 --> 19:54.447
is, uh, was a quiet person. He had got a PhD at the 
University of Pittsburgh and had been involved in

19:54.764 --> 20:05.399
the isolation of pantothenic acid, which is one of 
the vitamins.

20:08.864 --> 20:16.435
He worked basically in protein and protein 
metabolism and nutrition. He was the department

20:18.698 --> 20:21.362
head. And did he or someone else as you arrived give 
you any advice as a junior faculty member? As a

20:27.691 --> 20:28.613
matter of fact, no. I just went in it. I guess that's 
not entirely true. A close associate, extremely

20:33.843 --> 20:41.578
close associate, because I was in the same office 
with him, was J. Russell Couch. And I listened to

20:43.094 --> 20:47.099
Russell, and he was a flying boy, Anthony. He was 
this kind of a person that could get around. And so

20:49.702 --> 20:56.050
in terms of getting grants and things of a sort, I 
particularly. As far as you could tell at that

20:56.070 --> 21:05.020
point, were there some guidelines or rules that a 
young faculty member was expected to follow,

20:56.070 --> 21:05.020
whether the rules were written or not? No. No. You 
see, I was in biochemistry. And I had roots in

21:09.622 --> 21:13.829
Wisconsin and Cornell and research. And science 
was, in other words, moving towards science. This

21:19.298 --> 21:19.940
was it. I was not a practical animal husbandman at 
that particular point, although I taught the

21:20.280 --> 21:29.576
courses in animal nutrition and did research in 
large animals. I was hired. essentially to work in

21:33.635 --> 21:49.618
an animal breeding project to determine whether 
or not there could be constituents in the blood or

21:33.635 --> 21:49.618
something, biochemical constituents that were 
related to growth and growth rates. Where were you

21:49.638 --> 21:52.182
all quartered and what facilities? We were animal 
industries building. I was down below and then

21:54.728 --> 22:18.314
eventually I went up to the third, fourth floor 
with a laboratory on the fourth floor which they

21:54.728 --> 22:18.314
had put some air conditioning in for us and I had an 
office and shared an office with Jack, with John

21:54.728 --> 22:18.314
Mac Prescott and it was a small office. When, when 
did you two share an office? He came a year after I

22:22.606 --> 22:25.670
did. Because

22:25.710 --> 22:45.940
he came from Wisconsin and he got his PhD at 
Wisconsin under Esmond Snell, but he had finished

22:25.710 --> 22:45.940
it at the University of Texas as Ed Snell had moved 
to the University of Texas. And so he followed him

22:47.382 --> 22:51.027
down there, but the PhD was from the University of 
Wisconsin. In terms of rules or guidelines, what I

22:51.850 --> 23:07.727
was thinking of, was it assumed that a faculty 
member would be on the job a certain number of hours

22:51.850 --> 23:07.727
a day and would be dressed in a certain 
professional manner? Yes. What time did you all

23:11.631 --> 23:14.955
normally get here? We got in about 8 o'clock and 
stayed till 5, 6, 7. We spent at least 40 hours a

23:21.556 --> 23:24.621
week, 45 hours. We were often here in the evenings 
and doing research unless the temperature got too

23:24.662 --> 23:32.517
hot and things of this sort. Occasionally we'd go 
to a movie and because there was no air

23:36.755 --> 23:42.202
conditioning, of course, and the buildings could 
get warm.

23:45.826 --> 23:53.095
But fundamentally, we were kind of critical of 
everybody else because they didn't stay the extra

23:45.826 --> 23:53.095
hours. They didn't do the extra hours of research 
and things of that sort. Well, the biochemistry

23:56.620 --> 23:59.944
here was new. Who were the senior scholars in the 
department when you arrived? Well, the ones I

24:06.421 --> 24:14.025
remember mostly, I missed one particularly, who 
was Ralph Holman. Holman? Holman. H-O-L-M-A-N?

24:18.014 --> 24:25.970
who came in during the period I was at graduate 
school at Cornell and post-doctorate at

24:18.014 --> 24:25.970
Wisconsin. He went up to essentially back home to 
Minnesota and has been elected to the National

24:26.992 --> 24:39.297
Academy of Sciences there. Raymond Reiser was 
always there. Was he, was he present at that time?

24:44.797 --> 24:47.102
He was present at that time, very much so. Ray

24:47.142 --> 24:52.352
Richardson, L.R. Richardson. Let's digress. 
Raymond College. There were about five or six

24:56.239 --> 25:01.369
faculty members, and we called it this, what, 
Seven Little Kingdoms, because we were totally

25:01.788 --> 25:09.821
independent of each other, with Mac Prescott, of 
course, being one of the things. We were totally

25:09.881 --> 25:11.544
independent of each other. We'd help with each 
other. Our graduate students,

25:13.948 --> 25:21.721
faculty would sometimes jump all over the place 
and jump on them. And particularly, they made

25:22.222 --> 25:25.848
presentations of seminars and things of the sort. 
Seminars used to be on Saturday mornings. Did you

25:30.340 --> 25:38.457
seven though get together in any professional 
manner during the day or during the week? No. No,

25:39.824 --> 25:41.106
we... Didn't eat lunch together, didn't go to 
coffee together. We didn't eat lunch together.

25:44.530 --> 25:52.920
Because we were a small enough group, we always... 
And that seminar was appointed, which we

25:44.530 --> 25:52.920
generally all accumulated together. Let's 
digress on Raymond Reiser. When I got here, he... I

25:57.905 --> 26:05.014
soon realized he was kind of the self-appointed 
leader of the Jewish community here. Was... Were

26:08.900 --> 26:12.504
there many Jewish faculty members or staff 
members? I really don't know. I don't think so, but

26:14.345 --> 26:16.127
I don't know.

26:19.390 --> 26:21.272
All right, back to the mainstream. Did you have any 
teaching duties that first year? Yes, I taught

26:25.296 --> 26:28.499
animal nutrition. Is that a... Animal science or 
animal husbandry, 303. Animal nutrition. Just

26:38.756 --> 26:41.000
about all animal science majors took it? 
Everybody in agriculture took it. How large were

26:44.585 --> 26:46.648
the sections in the early years? Oh, the largest 
section I think I had was 165. Describe teaching

26:51.655 --> 26:53.377
that course. What was it like? It was fun. It was in 
the auditorium at the, what they call AI building,

26:56.502 --> 27:03.392
animal industries building. and they could go 
down and they eventually had one of these roll

27:04.317 --> 27:16.156
situations that you could do with a projection hub 
to keep. Apparently I sold myself very well

27:18.180 --> 27:27.034
because within four

27:18.180 --> 27:27.034
years I was named by the Agricultural Council as 
the outstanding faculty. That's great. And then

27:35.911 --> 27:46.508
in 1956, five

27:35.911 --> 27:46.508
years after I was here, I got the first of the Farmer 
Students Award for teaching. Did you get one the

27:50.800 --> 27:52.983
first year they were given? No, I got it the second 
year they were given, which is all right with me

27:53.323 --> 28:04.177
because the stipend was only $500 the first year, 
and it was $1,000 the next year.

28:04.678 --> 28:13.609
As a teacher, what were your guidelines that you 
had for yourself about teaching? My guidelines, I

28:15.074 --> 28:24.128
guess, for myself, I'm not even sure I really 
understood them.

28:24.488 --> 28:25.870
But you must have had some principles. I had some 
principles, but the only teaching experience I

28:26.411 --> 28:33.402
had is I took a course in methods of teaching in the 
Army. And I used those, and I came in and used those.

28:37.929 --> 28:43.377
And I got to the point where I didn't...

28:48.520 --> 28:49.781
I didn't use any notes. I walked in and started 
lecturing.

28:57.128 --> 29:00.110
Did the students think it was a tough course or an 
easy course? The students thought it was a tough

29:00.130 --> 29:02.152
course. Did they have a nickname for it? Uncle 
Kunkel's Mystery Hour. Uncle Kunkel. So was your

29:06.936 --> 29:08.718
nickname Uncle Kunkel? Uncle Kunkel, yeah. And so 
that was known, at least later on, it was known as

29:10.320 --> 29:15.224
Uncle Kunkel's Mystery Hour. But you didn't grade 
on the curve. You did grade on it? Oh, sure. Oh,

29:19.737 --> 29:20.518
okay. I did. I always did. And all animal science 
majors had to take it? All agriculture majors. All

29:29.330 --> 29:30.411
ag majors. Oh, okay. Okay. Do you remember any 
pranks or jokes the students attempted to play on

29:32.434 --> 29:36.259
Uncle Kunkel? Oh, not particularly. walked in one 
day and one student was writing Uncle Kunkel's

29:40.040 --> 29:45.148
Mystery Hour on the blackboard. He looked up and 
saw me. Then he took off and it seemed for the rest of

29:47.452 --> 29:51.358
the class. But I didn't mind it. You checked the 
roll. I checked the roll. Oh, you bet. Attendance

29:58.430 --> 30:00.654
was important as far as I was concerned. It's 
always important as long as I taught. And it had a,

30:04.259 --> 30:06.503
did it have a lab? No. Oh, it was all lecture. All 
lecture. How many years did you teach it? 11 years.

30:13.841 --> 30:15.384
And did you enjoy the teaching part? Yes, I did. 
Because I would have been surprised if you had said

30:16.746 --> 30:19.871
no. I actually taught three other courses. What 
were they? I taught enzymes in, or at least half the

30:25.981 --> 30:31.731
course of enzymes with Carl Lyman. in 
biochemistry. I taught because, you know, my

30:35.141 --> 30:50.681
major professor had won the Nobel Prize because of 
the isolation of urease, which essentially gave

30:35.141 --> 30:50.681
the structure as far as enzymology was concerned, 
enzymes was concerned. I taught, of course, in

30:51.442 --> 30:53.905
large animal nutrition. which I drew heavily from 
the physiology that I had had at Cornell. And then I

31:00.922 --> 31:07.438
took a course called biochemical genetics. And it 
was essentially the first molecular genetics or

31:09.342 --> 31:15.854
molecular biology course ever taught at Texas 
A&M. I taught that about the second year that I was

31:16.836 --> 31:19.981
there. It was in plant science department. So I was 
teaching in animal husbandry, biochemistry, and

31:23.067 --> 31:28.617
plant sciences.
