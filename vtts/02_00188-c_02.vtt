WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:05.174
Between the campus people and the Bryan people. 
And what did they fight over?

00:17.132 --> 00:20.337
Each one called each other names. Did y'all have a 
favorite nickname for Bryan? No. You mostly had to

00:27.968 --> 00:30.392
go to They had to go to Bryan because that's where 
all the car companies were. And the banks. The

00:36.455 --> 00:38.497
banks. You had to make friends with those. My 
father got awful mad at the First State Bank. And I

00:46.566 --> 00:53.113
remember he went down there one day and parked in 
front of the First State Bank over on the side of the

00:46.566 --> 00:53.113
hill. And he came walking out of there and he handed 
me this box. He says, hold on to this for a few

01:01.270 --> 01:03.473
minutes. And he backed the car out and went up the 
street to the city national bank. And we made

01:10.284 --> 01:18.196
friends with

01:10.284 --> 01:18.196
Aston. Now, there were then three banks, the first 
state, the first national, and the city national.

01:28.827 --> 01:41.901
Now, the college, the fiscal department, they had 
some

01:28.827 --> 01:41.901
regulations within themselves. Now, you could 
buy, they had a place. See, Dad had the, Dad in the

01:48.028 --> 01:56.938
Aggie and New England, he had a filling station for 
the entire college. That's where this building is

01:56.958 --> 01:58.800
built. So that could any employee fill up their gas 
tank? Oh, yeah. They sold it just like a regular old

02:06.901 --> 02:11.145
filling station. And then over there in another 
building, the milling

02:11.165 --> 02:24.940
part, the people that took care of the milling, 
They had one you'd go over there and buy two or fours

02:25.358 --> 02:36.252
and all sorts of plumbing and fixtures. Oh, 
really? Okay. Repair parts. They carried most of

02:41.519 --> 02:47.087
the stuff that the college had to use, and then they 
had an open market right there. Now, did the

02:47.908 --> 02:53.475
typical person who lived out here at college think 
of the Bryan people as stuck up,

02:56.932 --> 03:10.106
No, there were an awful lot of people that

02:56.932 --> 03:10.106
came from Bryan to college, like it is now. I don't 
know how many came from Caldwell. But they still

03:15.372 --> 03:17.334
fought. They still were— Well, they didn't fly. 
They were rivals. They were just rivals. And if you

03:24.134 --> 03:29.479
lived out here, did you use the phrase, we live out 
at college? No. What did you say? You lived at

03:31.721 --> 03:34.704
College Station. You used the word station. Back 
in the 20s? Oh, yeah. Oh, really? Okay.

03:42.051 --> 03:52.181
And it wasn't until Lankford got into it, Ernest 
Lankford, he was the one that was pushing the

03:42.051 --> 03:52.181
incorporation. The incorporation. And he did 
push it and did get a lot of it done. All right, now

03:59.552 --> 04:00.574
let's go back. You finished high school in what 
year? 31. 31. And are you, at that point, you're

04:07.244 --> 04:14.134
sure you're going to college? Oh, yeah. As a matter 
of fact, Dad went over to

04:16.258 --> 04:23.048
Ernest Lankford And he says, I don't know what he 
said to him. He said, will you let Bill come up here?

04:32.488 --> 04:37.916
At that time, the architecture was in the top of the 
administration building. And you should come up

04:37.936 --> 04:40.960
here, and will you teach him? Because I'd had, I'd 
already had, what do

04:42.523 --> 04:53.018
you call it, drawing. Mechanical drawing? 
Mechanical drawing. In mechanical drawing, you

04:56.930 --> 05:01.555
draw this up here and you turn it like this. In 
architecture, you slip it through and it makes it

05:02.656 --> 05:06.741
look a little sharper. Now, when you finished... 
Ernest Langford got me, he made me work the

05:07.582 --> 05:16.671
techniques out. In high school, had you been a good 
student? On average, just average. My biggest

05:23.997 --> 05:31.786
problem was with

05:23.997 --> 05:31.786
English. I never was good with English. And your 
strong courses were? Shop courses. Shop,

05:39.694 --> 05:41.456
engineering related? Or science related. It 
never bothered me. When you started as a freshman

05:48.284 --> 05:50.947
in the fall of 31? Yeah. Did you plan to be an 
architect? No. I was going to be an ag engineer. You

05:57.843 --> 05:59.004
were going to be an ag engineer. Just like my 
father. And where did you live as a freshman? Oh, I

06:06.692 --> 06:07.393
lived at home. You continued living at home? Oh, it 
was what they now call a... A day duck? Day duck. But

06:13.219 --> 06:14.260
you were in the Corps. Corps. What outfit? Coastal 
artillery. uh and uh did you tell me about uh lining

06:18.959 --> 06:48.493
up to get your uniforms and all of that

06:18.959 --> 06:48.493
you were given some uniforms

06:18.959 --> 06:48.493
the biggest thing was the gun you were you checked 
out a rocket What kind?

06:52.278 --> 06:53.060
Cold action. Springfield? Springfield.

06:57.689 --> 07:00.795
And where'd you keep it? Well, they were up there in 
that department. It was right where he got that

07:07.969 --> 07:10.735
big... across from Kiko's right in there. There 
was a bunch of steel buildings in there. And you

07:20.509 --> 07:25.456
went over there and they checked you out of a rifle. 
And I walked it back up there to the Ag Engineering

07:25.476 --> 07:29.442
Building right here. And over in one corner of this 
thing we had a tub. Here's a big thing.

07:40.955 --> 07:51.587
And then about two or three hours later, I'd go down 
and clean it up. Because that's something he

07:51.627 --> 07:54.811
wouldn't let all through that time. He had to do 
that. He couldn't just take the little rags and get

07:57.033 --> 07:59.676
it out. All right. Where did you register for 
classes? Do you remember? Did y'all line up in

08:04.882 --> 08:09.527
Sabeasa to register? No. I don't

08:11.223 --> 08:22.455
remember where the first place was. That would be 
31. I don't remember where it was. But later, it

08:27.260 --> 08:35.008
was a joke, because we'd be at home eating dinner. 
And dad said across the table, he said, really, you

08:36.237 --> 08:42.123
want to register? Yeah, I want to register. I paid 
for it all. I paid for it. I made money, and I paid for

08:47.248 --> 08:50.111
everything. It wasn't much. And so we'd go up there 
wherever that registration was. And he'd walk up

08:59.881 --> 09:03.645
to the door, and they had a guard there. I'm taking 
this man to the dean.

09:09.409 --> 09:13.214
He'd give me his cycle register and forget it. Did 
some of your buddies tease you about having that

09:13.675 --> 09:16.899
kind of privilege? No, they never knew anything 
about it. Oh, okay. Another privilege I had, too,

09:19.843 --> 09:27.034
you're supposed to wear a uniform when you went off 
campus. I never wore one. I've been down in Parker

09:31.320 --> 09:33.683
Ashton Hardware Company My father was talking to 
the commandant, and I was right with him. He would

09:40.520 --> 09:43.685
say that to me. Who was the commandant when you were 
an undergraduate? Oh, they had several of them.

09:51.596 --> 09:53.899
They're just the head of the whole business. 
During those first two years, describe your

09:54.480 --> 09:59.447
routine. You got up at what time, ate breakfast at 
home, But then did you have to come over and fall in

10:03.346 --> 10:06.709
with your outfit? No. No, they'd fall in. I never 
did have to go to meals.

10:19.582 --> 10:21.984
You had down military walls. You had all those 
different outfits. And then over here on this

10:26.129 --> 10:32.695
other one that went towards the depot, There was 
another set there. All right. What had happened is

10:37.451 --> 10:45.659
when they started up, they all moved like that, 
company front. And they were out there just like

10:47.181 --> 10:50.985
that. But in drill, we used a drill on the drill 
field, if there was such.

11:01.565 --> 11:04.188
They weren't really after me. Were there other day 
ducks in your outfit? Oh, yeah. They were

11:06.992 --> 11:11.157
scattered all the way through there, not very many 
of them. About how often did you come over and

11:11.177 --> 11:13.280
drill? Once or twice a week? Yeah, you had about 
two. It's just like a class. You didn't carry your

11:20.670 --> 11:24.334
gun. So you got up at home, ate breakfast, put on 
your uniform. and came to class, where'd you eat

11:31.417 --> 11:34.601
lunch? Went back home. Then in the afternoon, if 
you went to lab, you wore your uniform. Yeah,

11:44.092 --> 11:48.037
unless they specified otherwise. Do you remember 
what courses you took your freshman year? Oh, I

11:53.223 --> 11:55.025
guess they were English. I had to pull that thing. 
Do you remember some of those early teachers? Oh,

11:59.291 --> 12:00.512
well, no, not sure. Well, you see, the first one I 
ever had was Ernest Langford. Describe him,

12:05.373 --> 12:07.175
please, as a teacher. Oh, he was great. He was very

12:09.898 --> 12:19.029
particular about what he was trying to show you. 
And I never had any trouble doing it, but I could do

12:19.069 --> 12:24.795
what he would ask me. I'd been trained in

12:25.163 --> 12:34.793
handling pencils and stuff like that, you know. My 
father gave me, I still got it in my library right

12:36.275 --> 12:42.341
there. It's a German thing, it's all the 
instruments you need. Right on the back of it says

12:48.027 --> 12:51.070
1929. That's when I got out of,

12:51.860 --> 13:01.373
I guess that's when I went to Bryan. And did you make 
good grades that first year? Oh, I made just

13:06.880 --> 13:09.323
ordinary grades. But you didn't flunk out or flunk 
any courses or anything? No, the only one I ever

13:13.048 --> 13:17.614
flunked was first grade. It made me go back a second 
time, first grade. When you started college, did

13:23.324 --> 13:30.653
your dad or anybody else give you any advice about 
college success? No. We lived there, and we were

13:33.016 --> 13:41.106
always in an academic

13:33.016 --> 13:41.106
atmosphere. We were talking about stuff. He'd 
tell me to go do something.

13:51.192 --> 13:52.754
Here's another job I had. The CE department had 
courses in the summertime where they surveyed a

13:54.076 --> 14:14.747
railroad from up here on the curve up there all the 
way to the river, a railroad and a road. And Dad came

14:16.290 --> 14:19.174
to me one day and he says, They need some help over 
there, over there. And the Aggie and Nicaraguan

14:24.096 --> 14:36.050
had a flatbed IHC truck and four-cylinder engine. 
And I knew how to drive that. I drove it several

14:39.194 --> 14:40.896
times. I was about 14 years old. And he says, can 
you, would you want to go over there and haul these

14:47.791 --> 14:59.210
things out there to the job site and then come back 
and get their lunch and haul that out there and come

14:47.791 --> 14:59.210
back and then come back in the evening. I said sure. 
I took that old truck and all, somewhere along,

15:00.292 --> 15:05.561
wherever they went out there. I know that country 
out there just like the back of my hand because I had

15:07.264 --> 15:12.212
to find them. And there was one old place out there 
that was a great big old, it was a pretty good sized

15:13.745 --> 15:22.678
Negro church. And they had a big old bell up there in 
the front of it. So I'd park over there and ring that

15:27.245 --> 15:29.949
bell. And all those guys, it wasn't too far over 
there, they'd come walking over there. But also

15:34.997 --> 15:35.998
the Negroes. The Negroes. And so they... And 
Professor Ritchie was head of the department. We

15:48.905 --> 15:51.408
ate with him and everything like that. All the 
professors, they'd just sit down out there in some

15:51.448 --> 16:00.620
place, and we'd have lunch, and they had it out of 
their box. I mean, the boxes. They had two huge

16:02.042 --> 16:04.926
boxes bigger than these things here. And they were 
on the back of the truck. And I just backed up to the

16:07.950 --> 16:11.335
space hall, and they loaded them on. And we tied 
them down. We tied them down. And then we'd go out

16:14.258 --> 16:26.731
there, and then the professors, when we were 
through with the meal, they had a container,

16:14.258 --> 16:26.731
another container, and they took all the sugar. 
They wanted to make candy at the end of the season,

16:27.852 --> 16:32.437
so they took all the sugar. There was usually five 
pounds of sugar in there. And so then they just,

16:35.981 --> 16:40.806
they just, uh, So they'd take that stuff and then 
the professors told me, when you go back to town,

16:42.895 --> 16:57.137
you stop at these nigger people and you get rid of 
that food. And we don't want to send it back because

16:59.140 --> 17:04.228
they'll reduce the rations. So I'd stop and tell 
those niggers, and I had a regular Alright,

17:12.832 --> 17:42.332
now

17:12.832 --> 17:42.332
back here on the campus, how did you get 
indoctrinated into being an Aggie as a day duck

17:42.970 --> 17:46.976
fish, did you all get hazed? Did you get, what, give 
some examples. We had, you always had, you had yell

17:50.460 --> 17:57.190
practices. Okay. On the steps of the YMCA. Mm-hmm. 
And the seniors stood around the outside of that

18:01.896 --> 18:12.191
thing, that whole thing, with that sandbond belt 
in their hand. Mm-hmm. And then? You had to run it.

18:17.351 --> 18:18.973
Oh, you had to run the circle? No, you had to get out 
of there. Oh, oh, oh, I see. They had you hemmed up in

18:23.519 --> 18:25.521
there. All right, but how did they instruct y'all 
in how to whip out and what to say and all that? Where

18:34.372 --> 18:35.654
did you get that kind of? Oh, that was done in, well, 
you had a, You had a picture show, also. Over in

18:46.216 --> 18:46.897
Guyon? No. Oh.

18:51.242 --> 18:54.186
There were two of them.

18:56.288 --> 19:00.534
Next to the, next to the O.F.A. Chapel, this way, 
right beside the two dormitories that were, I

19:07.193 --> 19:10.336
think they were torn down now. But there were, 
there was, it was always right there. A picture, a

19:15.862 --> 19:17.624
movie theater? Yeah. One they called the Air Dome. 
Air Dome. The Air Dome. It was a building, just a big

19:24.552 --> 19:27.675
building come up like this. And the projector was 
way in the back there. And they had a screen up there

19:32.460 --> 19:37.065
on the, on the, on the that they projected onto, and 
then the

19:38.783 --> 19:50.514
seats were just up off the floor. They just, I don't 
know how they were built that way, but they were,

19:52.036 --> 20:03.046
every once in a while you'd have a set of planks. 
They were just planks. There was one for the feet

20:04.147 --> 20:08.031
and one for the butt coming across here. like that, 
supported somehow. But you could look underneath

20:10.990 --> 20:13.053
all that thing. There was a big concrete flat. And 
that was the air dome. That was the early one.

20:21.645 --> 20:37.427
Later, they tore that down, and they built the one,

20:21.645 --> 20:37.427
and it had, was built just like a regular theater 
was built. It had, on the west side there, they had

20:38.082 --> 20:43.910
stage.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.016
It wasn't much stage, but it was something. Then 
you had a balcony all over around this thing like

20:49.197 --> 20:55.686
this, and then you had the whole floor under here 
was full of them. Where was it located? The same

20:57.509 --> 21:00.473
place where the air... Oh, where the air dome was. 
They tore the air dome down and built this thing in

21:00.673 --> 21:04.839
there. And... So that's where they'd get you all 
together and No, that's just where we had kind of a

21:08.525 --> 21:15.574
yell practice once in a while. Or they'd get 
somebody up there and start to...

21:22.984 --> 21:29.953
But the funny thing about that was, was Cuball 
Richie.

21:32.677 --> 21:33.978
That's what they called him. He was head of the, one 
of the guy I worked for. He didn't have any hair, cue

21:39.203 --> 21:42.848
ball Richard. He was head of the, you

21:42.868 --> 22:03.578
know, the strength of the chair,

21:42.868 --> 22:03.578
all the structural engineering, whatever it was, 
structural engineering. Now the concrete was

22:03.658 --> 22:09.126
taught in a different place, but that,

22:10.608 --> 22:15.533
You took strength and materials from him, you took 
things like that from him. I actually had coated

22:16.334 --> 22:18.917
courses on him later on. But he'd go to that, his 
wife was, had a disability or something, I don't

22:20.479 --> 22:29.469
know. So this thing had two aisles in it like this 
and this whole thing in the middle was just a big

22:30.690 --> 22:37.678
mass of people. right square in the middle of this 
out there and he'd park her down here on the edge of

22:38.502 --> 23:02.518
that and she was in the wheelchair he'd walk out 
there about the middle of that thing and sit down he

22:38.502 --> 23:02.518
turned some seats down around you and he sat there 
and he never bought a peanut yet they were pitching

23:08.455 --> 23:11.440
Okay, okay. He was out there, and he just showed 
like a, and everybody's pitching. So he just

23:20.897 --> 23:25.886
reached over here in the seat and gave him some 
peanuts. When, do you remember when A&M faculty

23:25.906 --> 23:30.815
didn't have nicknames? Were the nicknames here 
when y'all got here? I never knew or recall much of

23:35.759 --> 23:38.742
anything. The only one we ever called or remember 
about was Dean Puryear. What was he? Pee-wee.

23:48.211 --> 23:48.692
Pee-wee. Because he was small? Yeah. Dean 
Pee-wee. Well, and there's Bear Tracks Bolton. I

23:56.659 --> 23:57.580
didn't ever know that. Oh, really? Bear Tracks 
Bolton.

24:02.505 --> 24:05.428
That means something. When he came in, he was in 
charge. I think that's what they meant. Did your

24:14.949 --> 24:17.271
dad have a nickname, as far as you know? Dan?

24:22.216 --> 24:29.204
And see, then when I get here, there's Screamin' Al 
Nelson in history. Dr. Nance was Notes Nance. D.B.

24:33.608 --> 24:35.230
Cofer was Dusty Butt. Because when he would erase 
the board, he would do this on his... I had him, but I

24:41.465 --> 24:44.889
never did know that. I had him, and then I had a 
fellow named Martin in English. Did you and your

24:53.601 --> 24:59.929
buddies, did y'all ever get a paddle used on you? 
No, I never did. But the same brown belt sometimes.

25:04.775 --> 25:08.119
You had to get out of that place down there. You were 
running something. You just ran like hell. I tried

25:11.763 --> 25:14.446
to break out of that thing. How did you and your 
buddies learn all of the minutia about the

25:14.466 --> 25:20.633
questions about A&M? Where did you learn all that? 
They never taught me anything. I just knew what

25:25.238 --> 25:28.062
they were talking about. They

25:28.802 --> 25:33.668
did... theater there, they did a lot of singing, 
because a fellow by the name of Dunn was, and some

25:33.884 --> 25:51.789
other, the other people that made those songs, 
those were all made in about there. You said Dunn,

25:51.829 --> 25:54.072
this is not J. Harold Dunn. No, it's Carl Dunn. Oh, 
oh, oh. He was, he was Oh, yeah, he was the, he

26:02.285 --> 26:06.270
directed the band for a long time, didn't he? Yeah. 
And he was, he had a daughter. She was partially

26:13.980 --> 26:17.764
crippled or something. You mentioned him. 
Describe the Aggie band while you were a student.

26:23.371 --> 26:23.872
It was good. How big was it, I reckon? Well, you're 
saying 200? Was it that big? I imagine it was. Did

26:34.159 --> 26:35.140
they march well? Oh, boy. I mean, just kidding. 
Were you Aggies proud of it? You were proud of it.

26:44.073 --> 26:47.338
And what were their halftime performances like? 
Oh, they always made a tee. They did? They always

26:51.164 --> 26:52.406
made a tee. Did they line up at the north end of Kyle 
Field to start? They always gave the opposite of

26:55.831 --> 27:01.519
the people that... Their opponents, the team, 
they had the halftime first. They always gave them

27:11.843 --> 27:15.327
that. They were quite gentle. And the only trouble 
that they ever had was with Baylor. Now, were there

27:23.476 --> 27:26.559
some problems with Baylor while you were a 
student? Describe those, please. Well, They went

27:33.359 --> 27:37.523
up there to Baylor, the student body did. Now the 
student body had what they called court trips. And

27:42.928 --> 27:44.710
the whole thing tried to go. And they also tried to 
try to get the railroads to give them a special car

27:45.911 --> 27:56.200
or something or a fare or something. But they 
wouldn't go around. So they would try to rent what

27:58.843 --> 28:03.147
they called a side door

28:09.877 --> 28:10.738
A boxcar? A boxcar. But you got to realize that in 
that time, you see the automobile was coming in,

28:12.902 --> 28:28.406
and we got the thumb going this way, see? And we had a 
special out there on that side. You'd have a whole

28:35.358 --> 28:47.192
bunch of curlers standing up there, and some guy 
would stop and pick up, and your uniform was what

28:35.358 --> 28:47.192
counted.

28:50.135 --> 28:54.841
Because when I came back from Brookings, I had my 
uniform. I carried it with me. I knew it. I never, it

28:58.055 --> 29:00.999
did cost me a dime. I went all the way home on some 
kind of a conveyance, another, never did ride as

29:01.500 --> 29:14.517
far as the truck did.

29:15.118 --> 29:19.083
But back, back to the problems with Baylor. Well, 
you see, they, they had uh, uh, There was quite a lot

29:26.219 --> 29:27.982
of rivalry. They brought a car, a Model T Ford, and 
they drove it onto the field during the halftime.

29:49.591 --> 29:54.998
And it had painted on the outside of it all the 
scores where Baylor had beat A&M. Oh, my. Oh, my.

29:57.261 --> 30:05.632
And they had taken some kids, and they looked, I 
don't know what they had. They

30:07.314 --> 30:14.303
looked like they were girls.

30:16.887 --> 30:18.048
I don't know whether they were. They were driving 
it, you mean? Yeah. what they thought they were

30:21.164 --> 30:23.828
girls. So the Corps went out there. They just went 
out there. And what they wanted to do, they were

30:29.696 --> 30:35.985
going to just pick that car up and escort it off of 
the field.

30:39.631 --> 30:43.056
Well, it didn't turn out that way. And a big fight 
ensued. And the baler opened up. had

30:51.370 --> 31:02.747
pieces of pipe in it, and that's what they were 
using. And so the Cobra took that car, and I don't

31:04.910 --> 31:18.390
know how they did it, I've never knew that, That car 
came the next day after that game. It was in Speza

31:28.294 --> 31:32.602
Hall.

31:32.863 --> 31:37.231
And all of this fight had occurred up at Waco.

31:38.474 --> 31:40.598
Was anybody badly hurt in the fight?
