WEBVTT

00:01.617 --> 00:05.542
You were born and where you spent most of your young 
life. Well, my full name is Ray Ben Nesbitt. It's

00:09.046 --> 00:15.394
not Raymond, it's not Benjamin, because we 
couldn't afford all the extra letters that were

00:09.046 --> 00:15.394
required for that. So it's very, and that's why I 
said Billy Don and this was JC. And that was the way

00:20.800 --> 00:22.182
you went by. You went by double names when I was 
growing up. But I was born on a dairy farm right

00:25.266 --> 00:31.033
outside of Marshall, about five or six miles. in a 
community that was known as Bear Bottom until

00:31.722 --> 00:35.327
1957. And they wanted some government money to put 
in a water system, so they changed it to Nesbitt,

00:35.367 --> 00:43.380
Texas. Did they really? Yeah. And that's spelled 
B-E-A-R, Bear Bottom. It's B-E-A-R. Bear Creek

00:47.065 --> 00:52.954
runs into Cypress about seven miles northwest of 
Marshall. they didn't think that bare bottom

00:53.862 --> 01:22.198
sounded like a good name to go to the government so 
it's now nesbit texas and my kids stole one of the

00:53.862 --> 01:22.198
city limit sign and it's in my den and it says nesbit 
texas population 376. so it's not a very big place

00:53.862 --> 01:22.198
in fact it's probably around 250. you still have 
relatives yeah but none of my direct family or my

00:53.862 --> 01:22.198
uncles and aunts and all those on my father's side 
are all dead, and my parents are both dead. On my

01:30.288 --> 01:37.799
mother's side, there are still her sisters and 
brothers that live in that same community. We have

01:37.819 --> 01:44.288
our own cemetery, Nesbitt Cemetery, established 
in 1846. So your family got into that area in that,

01:44.521 --> 01:48.887
really, in that time? Yeah. The two twins, Nesbitt 
twins, came down to fight the Mexicans about 1836

01:49.948 --> 01:59.442
and 1842. From Tennessee? Well, they actually, 
this group came from Kentucky, and their cousins

02:02.145 --> 02:07.873
were in Tennessee. And the ones that came down from 
Kentucky, their mother... delivered Abe Lincoln

02:13.225 --> 02:22.657
and Abe Lincoln's mother delivered the twins, the 
two Nesbitt twins, Robert Nesbitt and Nathan

02:13.225 --> 02:22.657
Nesbitt. And they came down to fight the Mexicans 
and then they went back up, but then they offered

02:22.677 --> 02:34.512
them some land, you know, a league of land for, you 
know, fighting. So they came down and then

02:37.643 --> 02:43.950
Following the Civil War, they invited their 
cousins from Tennessee to come down, and that's

02:37.643 --> 02:43.950
when my grandfather came down. He was Benjamin 
Franklin Nesbitt. So the Nesbitt group has been in

02:49.235 --> 02:54.061
that area for 150 years or so. That's an early 
settlement in that part of the country. So you grew

02:57.084 --> 02:58.345
up on a dairy farm. On a dairy farm. And you learned 
to milk cows. Learned to. I had to milk cows. My

03:03.192 --> 03:07.696
father ran a dairy for a while down in Plaquemines 
Parish, Louisiana. I know where that is. Before I

03:08.517 --> 03:12.101
came along, or about the time I came along, I guess. 
That's the worst job you could possibly have. It's

03:14.923 --> 03:22.030
seven days a week, and it starts very early, and it 
goes very late, with a lot of time off in between.

03:22.050 --> 03:25.113
And you went to school at Marshall High. Well, we 
were milking cows in those days by hand because of

03:25.413 --> 03:30.398
the... Rural electrification didn't come to that 
area until about 1944. So through the third

03:34.822 --> 03:41.107
grade... Did you use a cream separator, too? Yeah. 
Through about the fourth or fifth grade, we still

03:43.029 --> 03:53.659
were using kerosene lamps until 44 from 33, 11 
years, fourth or fifth grade. So I went to school in

03:53.679 --> 04:00.165
Marshall by bus, as everybody did in those days, 
and...

04:02.795 --> 04:05.858
I didn't take any science in high school at all. I 
didn't take chemistry, physics, or any of those

04:07.459 --> 04:12.164
because I took agriculture. It was a hell of a lot 
easier. And I didn't have to have any homework. And

04:16.888 --> 04:24.976
to get up and milk cows every morning and 
afternoon, I didn't want to have any homework to

04:16.888 --> 04:24.976
mess with. So as I said, then when I decided The last 
thing I wanted to do was to grow up, I mean, to stay on

04:29.221 --> 04:33.788
the farm. So I was going to get away from there. My 
dad went through the ninth grade, eighth grade,

04:37.373 --> 04:44.423
and my mother went through the ninth grade. And his 
objective in life is he's going to send all five of

04:44.443 --> 04:49.991
his kids to college. And he said, even if you had to 
sell all the land he had. You were there when I did

04:55.698 --> 05:00.163
that little talk up there, and he achieved his 
objective. In fact, my last sister graduated in

05:01.124 --> 05:09.594
the summer of 59, and he died in January 60. Is that 
right? Yeah. That was a common objective. That's

05:12.498 --> 05:15.862
quite an accomplishment, too, to have done it. You 
have brothers and sisters? I have four sisters.

05:18.465 --> 05:21.368
Four sisters, and you are the male of the family. 
I'm the only one of the male group. I had to get a boy

05:24.112 --> 05:25.333
dog. I have three daughters. So my mother's first 
11 grandkids were all girls. Is that right? Yeah,

05:32.536 --> 05:34.660
we just didn't have any males in the family. And you 
went to Texas A&M? Yep. Why? Because you wanted to

05:38.285 --> 05:39.988
be in agriculture? First of all, it was the 
cheapest place to go. Okay. And my only contact of

05:43.553 --> 05:48.641
any school was through the agricultural teacher. 
He was a graduate of A&M. That's right. And I had

05:51.225 --> 05:54.510
been to all the fat stock shows down in Houston. You 
and Ray had a parallel career. I won the dairy

05:56.761 --> 06:02.107
judging contest at the Houston Fat Stock Show in 
1948.

06:06.412 --> 06:09.035
But I decided that farming wasn't for me. And so 
when I got to A&M, the first thing I did is I went

06:09.055 --> 06:12.860
over. I was visiting. It was in the spring of 52. And 
there were a couple other friends of mine who were

06:18.326 --> 06:23.873
either freshmen or sophomore there. So they 
invite us down for a weekend. And there were

06:27.083 --> 06:28.507
several others who went down there. Because as it 
ended up, I think out of our class, we must have had

06:28.547 --> 06:36.208
10 or 11 boys from Marshall that went to A&M. in 
1952. So I went over to the placement office and I

06:40.136 --> 06:44.701
said, who made the most money of the graduates last 
year? You really did this? How serious?

06:48.886 --> 06:51.188
And who did you talk to in the placement office? Mr. 
Heaton was running it, but I was talking to one of

06:51.208 --> 06:54.552
his secretaries. He was still at Heaton. Yeah, 
Heaton was a good guy. Homer Lloyd Heaton, he was a

06:59.537 --> 07:02.500
good guy. So I asked, who made the most money of the 
graduates last year? And they said, well, the

07:05.891 --> 07:07.253
chemical engineers. And I said, fine, I'm going to 
be a chemical engineer. And they looked at my

07:10.498 --> 07:13.762
record, and they said, well, you can't. I said, why 
is that? You haven't had any chemistry or any

07:15.004 --> 07:17.027
physics. You've had no sciences. Well, I said, 
give me a chance. So they forced me to take summer

07:22.174 --> 07:25.799
school. I had to go to summer school to take 
chemistry the first summer. before they would

07:31.927 --> 07:36.312
agree that they let me into chemical engineering. 
Needless to say, I took chemistry and I graduated

07:36.332 --> 07:46.163
in three years with a degree in chemical 
engineering. Got married the day after I got out of

07:46.183 --> 07:49.187
high school. Oh, did you? Okay. I'm glad you asked 
that question. My wife went to A&M. So you went

07:53.812 --> 07:55.895
through A&M as a married student? Yeah. That's why 
I was in a hurry. Yeah, I can understand that.

08:01.087 --> 08:02.308
That's very formidable. That's very good. They 
told me I couldn't do it, but... Did you work, have

08:03.610 --> 08:08.155
scholarships? I borrowed money to go to school, 
and so it was very cheap to go to school in those

08:08.175 --> 08:14.822
days. It was $42 a semester, including all fees, 
and it included an annual and tickets to the

08:15.703 --> 08:25.113
football games and health insurance. That was all 
for $42 a semester. Rented an apartment in...

08:30.938 --> 08:33.083
College View, C12W. It cost $31.50 a month, all 
utilities paid. So... Yeah. And your wife went to

08:42.884 --> 08:44.007
school, too? No, she was not allowed to go to 
school. That's what I was, that was my question.

08:47.154 --> 08:48.677
She was not allowed to go to school.

08:52.606 --> 08:55.470
And you finished in three years, so that's 55. I 
started in the summer of 52, and I graduated in the

08:55.750 --> 09:08.226
spring of 55, and

08:55.750 --> 09:08.226
I only had to take 14 hours last semester to 
graduate. I have

09:08.306 --> 09:19.120
got approval to take... like uh physical 
chemistry and chemical engineering and thermo

09:19.927 --> 09:49.140
before i had taken physics and so i took them 
simultaneously although physics is a

09:19.927 --> 09:49.140
prerequisite for those two courses in those days 
and most of the professors you had in chemical

09:19.927 --> 09:49.140
engineering were in 200 andrews and lindsay 
lindsay used to teach uh he taught about two

09:19.927 --> 09:49.140
courses uh while i was there he He taught one 
sophomore course, which was sort of an

09:51.635 --> 10:04.890
introductory type chemical engineering, and he 
taught a senior course, which was, I would call it,

09:51.635 --> 10:04.890
what I call practical chemical engineering. 
Remember? It was...

10:06.052 --> 10:19.988
No, because one of them was that, you know, you had 
a... One of the quiz questions I remember, you've

10:20.305 --> 10:39.708
got a pile of sulfur that's so many tons, and you've 
got a sulfuric acid plant that's so far away, and

10:20.305 --> 10:39.708
how would you go about designing a process for 
moving the sulfur to where you use it in the

10:20.305 --> 10:39.708
process? And the only thing that was acceptable in 
those days was a black and a wheelbarrow. That was

10:46.517 --> 10:49.300
the only answer to the question that he would 
accept. I talked to his son, Hugh. Lindsay

10:56.418 --> 11:04.578
interviewed him, and he was talking about his dad 
grading papers, and he said he had one paper, and he

10:56.418 --> 11:04.578
still remembers his dad doing that. The student 
made such a high grade that his dad sat and was

11:06.830 --> 11:12.180
worried with that paper apparently all night long 
because he just don't do that. He just wasn't

11:12.200 --> 11:14.645
right, you know, and he really worked it through. 
Yeah, he's in the book here. He said he made a

11:15.627 --> 11:19.474
hundred, and he was determined to find something 
wrong with it. Yeah, that's interesting. Andrews

11:21.799 --> 11:23.743
was your favorite. He was the best real teacher of 
any of the group. I had Bishop, I think, in one

11:30.185 --> 11:33.289
class. People liked Bishop. He was likable, but he 
wasn't that good. I don't think I ever had Holland.

11:44.001 --> 11:45.642
I don't think I ever had Harris. His son was in our 
class, Don Harris. He graduated with us. He has a

11:53.331 --> 11:55.594
grandson. Is that right? See this one right here? 
William Donald Harris Jr. Okay, let me know. He was

12:05.815 --> 12:07.678
in the classroom. Of this group of 23, how many do 
you think ended up working for Exxon?

12:19.073 --> 12:19.253
Thirteen. Well, no, you had DuPont Shell, you had 
Carbide, you had Lubrizol, you had Diamond

12:19.273 --> 12:26.803
Alkali, you had... Houston Ship Channel was 
pretty well faster than companies in those days,

12:27.188 --> 12:37.108
but six of the 23 ended up there. Now let me ask you, 
while you were in school, did you feel like you were

12:37.990 --> 12:46.868
being pointed in any special direction as a 
chemical engineer, in petroleum, in... I don't

12:47.725 --> 12:48.847
know what. Well, at one time, I was going to take a 
joint degree in petroleum engineering and

12:48.867 --> 12:54.515
chemical engineering. Okay. So I more or less... 
You assumed you would go into petroleum industry

12:54.855 --> 12:58.841
somehow or in some capacity. Was that pretty much 
the assumption within the department? Would you

13:02.987 --> 13:10.278
say the Department of Chemical Engineering in 
those days was definitely pointed toward

13:02.987 --> 13:10.278
petroleum?

13:10.298 --> 13:11.960
Or was pointed... Not definitely. I don't want to 
be too strong. No, because, you know, we used to go

13:12.661 --> 13:16.787
on these field trips and we went on... a trip in 54 
and we went to Sea Drift and we visited Carbide's

13:17.122 --> 13:24.374
new facility, just started up. They had an 
ethylene oxide glycol, steam cracker, ethane

13:24.875 --> 13:33.130
cracker, and they had a polyethylene. Then they 
took us to

13:33.150 --> 13:41.003
Dow and we visited their magnesium operations. At 
that time, they were using these aircraft engines

13:42.535 --> 13:46.962
for generating power. Remember those old rotary 
engines? You probably don't remember that. We

13:52.411 --> 13:58.541
also visited the Alcoa plant at Rockdale. Is that 
where it was? Yes. We visited Humboldt Oil and

14:00.784 --> 14:05.852
Refining Company, and we visited Texas City 
Carbide. Now, who took you on those trips and

14:05.872 --> 14:07.615
stuff? Well, actually, in those days, the bird dog 
was Holland. He was the one that... Was he doing

14:12.055 --> 14:15.218
that? He was doing that. He was given that 
responsibility. Let's put it that way. I guess the

14:19.724 --> 14:25.550
same thing is true for every spring and every fall. 
I forgot which one. Senior class in the fall, or

14:29.114 --> 14:32.758
vice versa. Junior class in the fall. One time, a 
senior fire department had three days, and what do

14:34.561 --> 14:44.235
y'all call it? Oh, yeah, we didn't have any. And you 
met at these plants. Yep. And you were on this

14:49.762 --> 14:52.546
channel. Yep. And there'll be some visits to the 
plant. And those visits sort of influenced your

14:59.416 --> 15:03.842
direction, or...? Do you remember anything 
special about them as a consensus? Or a better

15:08.787 --> 15:11.530
understanding of the business you were going to 
get into? I had a better understanding of the type

15:11.590 --> 15:21.040
of company I would like to work for because I 
remember the guy who was the recruiter at Carbide.

15:21.201 --> 15:27.427
His name started with an I, an Italian name, but 
Ignatius or something like that. I remember the

15:29.870 --> 15:32.833
manager at Seadrift. Marvin Eccles. He was a 
fairly recent A&M graduate, I guess, when he

15:34.596 --> 15:40.723
became manager of the Carbide plant.

15:43.346 --> 15:46.069
But as a result, it told me who I wanted to 
interview. And I interviewed Shell, Carbide,

15:46.709 --> 15:53.737
DuPont, and Humble. And I worked the summer of 54 
for Humble. And so when I interviewed, I had four

15:58.682 --> 16:01.625
offers. I could have gone to UOP, but I said, 
there's no way. Don't make me an offer. I'm not

16:05.962 --> 16:07.924
going to Venezuela. I had no desire to want to go to, 
I forgot the name of that town. Exxon had a great big

16:13.269 --> 16:16.252
refinery in Aruba at the time. It was a part of the 
Creole operation. But UOP, that's where they

16:20.116 --> 16:25.981
started their new employees, some of these 
startup sites. So I got four offers, and the lowest

16:28.423 --> 16:33.448
offer I got was from Humble. And that's the one I 
accepted. And I accepted it because the previous

16:36.023 --> 16:42.014
summer I worked for a guy named George Mason. And to 
me, he was a very, very impressive guy. And he was

16:46.382 --> 16:48.326
the type of guy I wanted to work with. And so that's 
why I accepted the job there. Because of your

16:52.494 --> 16:53.916
previous summer? Previous summer, he'd been my 
boss. So I get there in 55, and in 56, he leaves the

16:56.294 --> 17:01.102
company and goes to work for Tenneco. And he became 
the number two guy in Tenneco before he retired. I

17:05.950 --> 17:07.552
still see him around here. He's quite an 
individual.

17:11.599 --> 17:15.906
Now, so you're coming to Houston, your first job. 
What happened is I went to talk to Lindsey. And

17:19.079 --> 17:24.265
another perception of all this was that when you 
got out of school, you would stay in Texas. Yeah,

17:24.285 --> 17:25.847
that's what I was going to tell you. I went to see 
Lindsey and talked to him about a job, which, you

17:25.867 --> 17:34.078
know, get a little counseling from him. And he 
said, well, I'd go to work for any of the four except

17:35.400 --> 17:39.625
one. He said, don't go to work for Hummel. And I 
said, why? Why do you say that? Oh, he said, they

17:45.468 --> 17:59.034
have this damn practice school down there, and 
they weed out 10, 20 percent of their people every

17:45.468 --> 17:59.034
year, you know, and they've been sort of rough on 
some of my students. And I said, well, gee, my

17:59.394 --> 18:06.548
reasoning for wanting to go was to take practice 
school. I said, I've rushed through college, and I

18:07.203 --> 18:32.212
would like to get something on what I call 
applications

18:07.203 --> 18:32.212
that would, it was a 13-week course, you know, 
eight hours a day, five days a week, or 12 hours a

18:07.203 --> 18:32.212
day, five days a week, and all of the unit 
operations and the specific processes that we had

18:07.203 --> 18:32.212
at Baytown. So I said, I looked on that as a sort of 
opportunity to sort of put in place how you can go

18:37.460 --> 18:42.347
from the theoretical to the practical. And I said, 
I was leaning toward accepting the job with

18:43.088 --> 18:46.993
Humble. I said, first of all, that's the only one of 
this group where I don't think I'll ever have to

18:47.634 --> 18:58.930
leave the state

18:47.634 --> 18:58.930
of Texas. And what did he say to that? He didn't say 
anything. You know, he's advised on this one, how

19:01.514 --> 19:06.100
he was in the Texas locations. And then after a 
couple of years, you can move them out. Wherever

19:09.743 --> 19:13.389
you want them.

19:13.409 --> 19:15.011
Now, so you're coming as what? What capacity? What 
is your job when you're first hired? Junior

19:17.956 --> 19:18.697
engineer. That was the lowest. And at the time, I 
went to... And now are you in the office or the field

19:20.820 --> 19:24.687
where they're putting you? Well, we had the old 
main office building there at Baytown. It's been

19:29.013 --> 19:30.436
torn down since then. But they had what was called 
Tech Service Division. and it consisted of 85

19:35.003 --> 19:39.707
chemical engineers, all chemical engineers. At 
Baytown, we said there's chemical engineers and

19:41.049 --> 19:44.592
there's other engineers. It was the way we used to 
put it. And the chemical engineers made up the tech

19:47.635 --> 19:55.602
service group, and the engineering department 
consisted of all other engineers.

19:58.665 --> 20:02.428
Of that group, when I went to work there, The first 
level of supervision was called a section head.

20:07.512 --> 20:17.123
And the most recent promotion to section head was a 
guy by the name of Glenn Wilson. And he had been out

20:17.143 --> 20:22.369
of rice since 1936. So he had been with the company 
12 years before he made section head. It was a group

20:31.096 --> 20:41.328
of pretty good quality because they'd been taking 
bottom 10% out for years and years and years.

20:41.789 --> 20:44.352
That's the only way they could continue to bring in 
new blood. And so you get rid of eight to ten people a

20:45.513 --> 20:49.118
year and you've hired ten or twelve. Some of those 
had been Lindsey's people and he didn't like that.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.602
And he didn't like that. Hamp Oliver was one in the 
class before me. Pete Gola, Jerry Jenkins. I don't

20:59.025 --> 21:01.028
know if you remember these guys or not. I don't know 
Jerry Jenkins. Pat Souther.

21:06.095 --> 21:11.183
But he didn't like the idea of the weeding people 
out like that. He didn't think that was very good.

21:12.845 --> 21:16.410
But I thought it was a pretty good approach. But you 
did go through the practice school, and then you

21:16.691 --> 21:22.339
were put in the Tech Services Division. I was in the 
Tech Services Division, and you started in June.

21:26.429 --> 21:33.581
And practice school started the first of 
September and went through Christmas. And the

21:33.841 --> 21:37.427
bottom guy in the class left. It was only 10 of us, so 
even 10% won. And so with that type of weeding out

21:41.974 --> 21:53.112
process and not forcing people to move to other 
parts of Standard Oil in those days, We had a pretty

21:54.087 --> 21:59.233
high-class organization.

21:59.253 --> 22:03.779
From that organization came Pervin and Gertz. 
They started consulting Pervin and Dallas. The

22:07.343 --> 22:13.110
Pace Company, Payne, Askey, Service, and 
Eckholm. Is that where Pace is? Okay. Yeah. Payne,

22:15.392 --> 22:18.396
Askey, Service, and Eckholm. Bonner and Moore. 
You ever hear of Bonner and Moore? I think I have.

22:24.530 --> 22:26.232
plus a whole bunch of people. One of them was the 
chairman of Continental, came out of that tech

22:26.933 --> 22:32.140
service group. The vice president of 
acquisitions for W.R. Grace came out of that

22:32.160 --> 22:38.548
group. George Mason was the number two guy in 
Tenneco. Excuse me, six of you who went into that

22:43.214 --> 22:46.118
were Aggies. No. No. There were, in that 
particular class, there were only...

22:56.592 --> 23:00.037
One, two, three of us. Now, where are most of the 
other hirees coming from? Well, one of them went on

23:02.821 --> 23:04.803
to graduate school. Two of them went to graduate 
school, John Frondley and Bob Zumwalt. They both

23:09.590 --> 23:13.515
got a Ph.D. and then came to work for Exxon. So of the 
group that went to work,

23:13.535 --> 23:21.546
we had, there were three of us. Jack Spellings. 
Spellings? Jack Spell. Spell. He was Don Harris's

23:29.379 --> 23:32.823
best friend. They grew up in Bryan. Yeah, Jack 
Spell and myself and Tom Campbell all started

23:35.765 --> 23:45.595
immediately. John Frondlick and Bob Zumwalt came 
in after they finished graduate school and Jim

23:45.795 --> 23:54.443
Knudsen went to work for Carbide and worked for 
Carbide for two years, and then came to work for

23:54.777 --> 23:59.223
Exxon. So that was the sixth out of the 23. And where 
is Exxon hiring from? The rest of the people in your

24:03.569 --> 24:06.473
tech services division came from where? Any 
concentration? Oh, we had... Rice, LSU, MIT...

24:07.995 --> 24:14.404
From everywhere you can think of. We had MIT, we had 
Texas University, LSU, Tulane, we had...

24:23.684 --> 24:51.463
delaware wisconsin minnesota michigan yeah 
obviously there's an obvious concentration uh

24:23.684 --> 24:51.463
rice

24:23.684 --> 24:51.463
well let's see one was from harvard business 
school one was a phd out of texas one was from

24:23.684 --> 24:51.463
oklahoma state one was from university of 
oklahoma One was from

24:52.523 --> 25:04.358
Louisiana Tech, and one was from Arkansas, and the 
rest I was staying in. Now, when you start your

25:04.738 --> 25:14.991
first job and you're looking at your peer group 
there, how do you stack up with that bunch in terms

25:04.738 --> 25:14.991
of your own comfort index, in terms of your 
training? You were comfortable with what you had

25:15.011 --> 25:17.434
been through. Oh, I thought I was as well-trained 
as they were. I think that A&M's always had a very

25:22.380 --> 25:28.628
good reputation for undergraduate training. 
Always have. And I think they do a good job in that

25:29.810 --> 25:31.732
area. And of course, from the standpoint of what 
the state is expecting, that's exactly what they

25:32.293 --> 25:38.040
want. Sure. That's exactly what they wanted. You 
have to. Yeah. So you're going to be in the Tech

25:44.600 --> 25:48.566
Services Division for how long? Well, I figure 
I've got to stay there 12 years in order to get

25:49.547 --> 25:53.753
promoted.

25:57.278 --> 26:02.846
So I started off working in the chemicals area 
because I was working on a butadiene unit and a

25:57.278 --> 26:02.846
butyl plant. We had just acquired the butadiene 
and the butyl plant from the federal government in

26:04.168 --> 26:11.518
March of 1955, right before I showed up. And at that 
point in time, we were dehydrogenated normal

26:14.198 --> 26:21.368
butylenes. We had a process where we took the C4 
strain, we used acid extraction to get

26:21.608 --> 26:28.477
isobutylene, and that went to the butyl rubber 
plane. We had an

26:29.418 --> 26:37.489
extractive distillation process where we 
separated the butylenes from the butanes, okay?

26:42.650 --> 26:47.055
It was, we called it the GK unit, I don't know. It was 
a, I forgot what kind of extractive or azeotropic

26:47.075 --> 26:57.728
type, just a what?

26:57.748 --> 27:06.919
And then we take the butylenes and dehydrogenate 
them, you know, over the old shell 105 catalyst,

26:57.748 --> 27:06.919
which is an iron oxide, I think. and using very high 
temperature steam, 1400 degrees or something

27:07.912 --> 27:18.245
like that. I remember that it was anytime you heard 
that there was a steam leak at the dehydro unit, you

27:18.265 --> 27:25.955
didn't walk. What you did is you got a pole and put a 
rag on the end of it because you cannot see 1400

27:26.556 --> 27:34.105
degree steam. And therefore, when the little 
handkerchief disappeared, you knew where the

27:34.372 --> 27:39.817
leak was.

27:42.720 --> 27:49.587
So you're going to be working on your 12 years

27:42.720 --> 27:49.587
in that unit. Well, I figure I am. But in about three 
years, I'm a section unit. And the first job they

27:55.153 --> 28:02.640
gave me was there was a guy from Arkansas that they 
wanted me to get rid of. That was the first

28:02.890 --> 28:08.138
assignment. So you get started with learning how 
to deal with people. And I guess about... But

28:15.109 --> 28:16.030
you're still in Houston. Still in Baytown. Still 
in Baytown. And so this is about 1959, I guess, 58 or

28:18.875 --> 28:26.907
59 that I become a section head. And then, you know, 
things rock along. And this guy, George Mason, who

28:29.993 --> 28:37.701
went with Tenneco, calls me up and invites me over 
to see him. And he offered me the job as chief

28:37.761 --> 28:44.749
engineer for Tenneco Orkin. So I went and visited 
Chalmette, Louisiana, I think it is. And I told him

28:49.635 --> 28:56.763
I'd give him an answer on Saturday. On Friday, They 
reorganized the old tech service division and

28:58.223 --> 29:05.856
reorganized the whole refining operation. They 
split off chemicals from petroleum, where we made

29:06.858 --> 29:15.894
two separate entities, had a chemical plant 
manager and a refinery manager. And I was given the

29:16.715 --> 29:23.387
job of technical superintendent for chemicals.

29:23.907 --> 29:26.690
So I called Mason up to talk to him. I decided I was 
going to accept the job. I called him up and he said,

29:28.532 --> 29:37.402
I withdraw my offer.

29:37.842 --> 29:40.385
He said, you're going to stay. That's what he told 
me, you're going to stay. That was nice. That was

29:45.551 --> 29:47.774
nice of you to do that. We've made good friends over 
here. So Exxon now really is defining its mission.

29:55.135 --> 29:58.058
I was on the committee that split chemicals from 
the oil side. We divided up all the assets and

29:58.138 --> 30:01.382
things like that. And this was in 59? 1961. 61. And

30:04.425 --> 30:14.236
I had been on the committee to divide up assets. 
They reorganized in 62, and that's when I became

30:14.256 --> 30:19.682
the superintendent Technical Superintendent 
for Chemicals. And then in 63, I got moved to New

30:24.033 --> 30:33.427
York, working for NJ Chemical Company, running 
the projects in Long Range. NJ, E-N-J-A-Y, just to

30:33.447 --> 30:37.473
make sure. That's the way all of this, you know, 
like SO. SO2. SO is Standard Oil, S-O. And NJ, New

30:47.347 --> 30:49.770
Jersey. It was E-N-J-A-Y. So this one is S-O and 
this one is N-J. That's where those two trademarks

30:56.770 --> 30:59.894
came from. So now I'm working in New York, living in 
Connecticut. And that was in 63 and in 68. Now

31:11.649 --> 31:14.813
you're primarily, are you moving more and more in?
