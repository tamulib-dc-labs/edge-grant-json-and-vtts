WEBVTT

00:03.423 --> 00:08.628
I think they all pretty well, I can't, I don't think any more money losers.

00:08.668 --> 00:10.710
We had the bowling alley, of course.

00:10.830 --> 00:15.895
We had the food services, which was the formal dining, well, the catering.

00:15.955 --> 00:19.499
And then the fountain room, of course, which was the only one.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.139
And the hotel.

00:20.179 --> 00:21.140
And the hotel.

00:21.281 --> 00:22.942
They all paid for themselves, you think?

00:22.962 --> 00:23.823
Oh, yeah.

00:23.903 --> 00:26.586
And they provided money into the general.

00:27.407 --> 00:29.669
Plus you got some student activity fees.

00:29.689 --> 00:31.911
Yes, student activity fees.

00:32.482 --> 00:42.379
There was a, I guess it was an MSC fee as well as, I can't remember whether the town hall was a separate fee or not.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.022
I don't either.

00:44.042 --> 00:51.334
I don't, there was a student fee, there might have been more than one fee there, I'm not sure.

00:51.550 --> 00:53.793
But I, you know, very nominal.

00:53.913 --> 00:57.098
It wasn't, you know, I wasn't going to get rich off of it.

00:57.638 --> 01:05.709
What about some anecdotes relating to Wayne to demonstrate his personality, plus or minus?

01:07.992 --> 01:08.794
Oh my goodness.

01:15.363 --> 01:20.089
Do you remember where he ever got really frustrated at somebody?

01:23.410 --> 01:32.138
Yes, but you know, naming times and places, he had to get along with so many people all the time.

01:35.001 --> 01:45.290
What about some proposal that he made to Mr. Rutter or some other president that they found hard to accept?

01:45.310 --> 01:49.774
You know, those, I guess, were so commonplace to single anyone out.

01:51.476 --> 01:53.097
You know, there was a constant

01:54.005 --> 02:06.880
dialogue about trying to get something done, you know, accomplished either physically or in service or in, you know, the whole university was pretty poor at that time.

02:06.940 --> 02:09.643
You know, there wasn't any surplus money.

02:10.804 --> 02:15.930
And it was a matter of, you know, who got there first, mostly.

02:18.413 --> 02:19.354
I'm trying to,

02:22.456 --> 02:24.759
Now, one, he and C.K.

02:24.919 --> 02:31.827
Eston, you know, didn't see eye to eye, but yet I think he gave C.K.

02:31.867 --> 02:37.714
a free reign because he realized that, you know, C.K.

02:37.735 --> 02:39.356
didn't care for Wayne at all.

02:39.517 --> 02:40.838
I got to know C.K.

02:41.659 --> 02:44.523
years later, even after I left the MSC.

02:45.764 --> 02:49.729
That was one relationship that worked, yet they...

02:50.384 --> 02:53.068
you know, bannered back and forth.

02:55.052 --> 03:00.000
There was another guy there that left here that Wayne didn't care for.

03:01.322 --> 03:04.868
Probably shouldn't say, I can't even remember his name, it's probably just as well.

03:05.168 --> 03:10.397
Remember any pranks, Good Bull, that the students tried to play on Wayne?

03:14.203 --> 03:14.704
Oh...

03:16.152 --> 03:17.074
Not much.

03:17.194 --> 03:20.179
Wayne was pretty serious about a lot of things.

03:20.239 --> 03:25.168
There wasn't a lot of slack for pranks there.

03:25.248 --> 03:29.576
There's bound to have been some, but nothing jumps out.

03:30.036 --> 03:39.493
Do you remember anything that just went confused, something that just didn't turn out the way it was supposed to, that in hindsight is...

03:41.397 --> 03:43.240
interesting and or amusing?

03:45.023 --> 03:48.008
Somebody that didn't make it here or somebody that was late?

03:49.371 --> 03:51.695
We sweated out Van Clyburn, I know.

03:51.715 --> 03:57.685
I had to send a plane after Van Clyburn one time to

03:58.593 --> 04:06.067
He couldn't be located within hours before the concert was to start with the San Antonio Symphony.

04:06.388 --> 04:11.578
Was that the first concert in Rudder?

04:13.742 --> 04:14.664
Probably so.

04:14.744 --> 04:17.209
Because Van Claiborne was the first official

04:17.982 --> 04:25.255
Jacques Cousteau, we had him unofficially there early that week, but Van Claiborne was the first official.

04:25.395 --> 04:34.151
Yeah, and of course that was, if it was Rudder Auditorium, and indeed it was, that was after I was associated with MSC, but I do remember the incident.

04:34.212 --> 04:41.104
I was on Opus board, I guess, the reason I was aware of that, but Van Claiborne didn't show up.

04:41.523 --> 04:47.519
But Wayne was always getting somebody's airplane to go after somebody.

04:49.164 --> 04:53.355
I remember I flew somewhere with Dick Winerti and his wife.

04:54.652 --> 05:06.848
to, I guess, over to that Methodist encampment, you know, the fish of Palestine, yeah, which incidentally was a very fine thing back then.

05:06.888 --> 05:09.291
Ain't worth much now.

05:10.292 --> 05:13.897
Turned it over to kids and it's a wild thing.

05:14.197 --> 05:18.082
Oh, yeah, we went up there not a couple of summers ago.

05:18.102 --> 05:22.768
One of those camps was named in honor of our daughter and we went up there.

05:23.491 --> 05:33.045
And it's not like John Paul Abbott teaching you about your manners and your conduct and how to

05:33.397 --> 05:37.264
hold a spoon or a fork or something at an inner table or something.

05:37.284 --> 05:51.892
Because he used to, for years I went to talk about what land grant education was intended to be, which in my discussion always was it was supposed to make you real world capable.

05:52.673 --> 05:54.797
That theory is fine.

05:54.963 --> 05:58.327
But even better, is theory made into reality?

05:58.367 --> 06:02.491
That's what land-grant education is supposed to emphasize.

06:05.154 --> 06:12.342
When you began with the MSC, describe the range of what happened in the MSC.

06:12.362 --> 06:15.785
There were about how many hotel rooms and so forth?

06:16.006 --> 06:19.249
There were 66 hotel rooms.

06:20.073 --> 06:43.026
very small you know when the building was built they had real trouble getting it air conditioned you know that was one of the first buildings air conditioner consequently the air conditioning system that was put in there was 20 years old when it got there in design and it was not adequate

06:43.512 --> 06:48.505
The first keys to the hotel rooms were these old skeletons.

06:49.328 --> 06:56.627
Well, Wayne had to fight tooth and toenail to get those replaced and something suitable.

06:56.945 --> 06:58.888
The air conditioner finally gave up.

06:58.928 --> 07:06.561
Someone sabotaged that air conditioner one time, a disgruntled employee who remained nameless.

07:07.843 --> 07:24.049
But he was kind of unhappy and he sabotaged that thing so that it wouldn't shut off when it reached the cooling level and just kept grinding on and just froze itself up, you know, totally and just ruined the thing.

07:24.451 --> 07:45.666
and it took us oh two or three weeks to get that straightened out right you know like in may or something and oh it was a terrible terrible thing but it was finally put on the system-wide air conditioning system but it had its own system there uh i forgot now if you

07:45.798 --> 07:47.161
What the range was?

07:47.581 --> 08:05.916
All the student activities, you know, going to work there was, you know, I think as far as I was concerned, you were going to work with the epitome of everything real fine as far as the university or this community was concerned.

08:06.335 --> 08:11.565
Then, you know, the MSC opened in 1950, and we're talking just 12 years later.

08:11.625 --> 08:23.348
It still was held in very high esteem community-wise, and working there, I count it as quite a privilege, but all the student activities and dealing with the

08:23.918 --> 08:34.573
the town hall people, this space fiesta thing would come up, you know, every year when, you know, when it was just underway.

08:36.095 --> 08:46.930
And the anything social, cultural, stemmed from the activities at the MSC and the whole community.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.455
So that I thought was great.

08:50.495 --> 08:53.740
And one of the first things I did, or he sent me off to

08:54.277 --> 08:56.500
visit other student unions.

08:57.621 --> 09:06.032
And I went up to the University of Maryland and stayed two or three days there.

09:06.693 --> 09:18.047
This was in the spring of 63 and went from there to the University of Wisconsin where it was kind of the daddy of student union work was there.

09:18.087 --> 09:22.933
And from there we went to the national conference in Chicago

09:23.555 --> 09:25.437
of the student union thing.

09:25.477 --> 09:30.001
So, you know, all this was a big, grand, new world to me.

09:30.062 --> 09:43.715
And as I say, all social and cultural things that stemmed, not just A&M, but from the community, stemmed from, I think, the MSC there.

09:43.755 --> 09:47.199
And this was, you know, great, you know.

09:47.219 --> 09:49.461
It was beautiful to me.

09:49.947 --> 09:55.494
Do you remember when a celebrity came to the campus, they stayed at the MSC, didn't they?

09:56.235 --> 10:00.420
Do you remember any anecdotes related to any of those visits?

10:00.440 --> 10:03.423
Oh, I can remember when Johnson came.

10:03.503 --> 10:04.985
He came here for something.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.888
He was vice president, I think.

10:07.068 --> 10:07.909
To speak at Scona.

10:08.630 --> 10:09.170
Was that it?

10:09.310 --> 10:09.811
In 62.

10:10.692 --> 10:17.220
And they, you know, their people ahead of time drove you nuts with

10:17.723 --> 10:22.868
I remember the Johnson girls came here, I think, in association with that.

10:22.928 --> 10:31.857
I can remember the Johnson girls being here for something, and they're being overseen by the Secret Service and whatnot.

10:31.957 --> 10:35.821
All right, let me put on this tape then an incident that I witnessed.

10:36.462 --> 10:36.642
Okay.

10:37.343 --> 10:39.605
We didn't have women enrolled yet.

10:40.426 --> 10:43.509
Linda Bird was a freshman at the University of Texas.

10:43.789 --> 10:45.351
Skona was in December.

10:45.938 --> 10:50.542
and the Longhorns had just massacred the Aggies on Thanksgiving here.

10:53.285 --> 10:57.829
So the Corps commander is going to take Linda Bird to lunch in Duncan Dining Hall.

10:58.129 --> 10:58.710
Oh, brother.

11:00.131 --> 11:08.279
At a given signal, prearranged, every freshman in the Corps jumped up and yelled, beat the hell out of T-U, yay, yay, yay.

11:08.939 --> 11:09.880
Oh, no.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.222
Linda Bird then, and they all stare at her.

11:12.983 --> 11:15.085
Linda Bird puts her napkin on the table,

11:15.908 --> 11:19.075
stands up, the room is now stony silent.

11:19.877 --> 11:27.454
She pushes the chair underneath, looks around the room, and then with both hands in the air, yells,

11:28.295 --> 11:29.056
Hook them horn.

11:29.977 --> 11:30.958
Well, bless her heart.

11:30.998 --> 11:31.819
And they applauded.

11:32.019 --> 11:32.640
Good.

11:32.820 --> 11:33.801
All right.

11:34.322 --> 11:34.962
Well, great.

11:34.982 --> 11:40.769
I told that one day to Mrs. Johnson in 1980, right after we went to El Paso.

11:40.789 --> 11:43.311
And when I finished, she said, that's my girl.

11:44.693 --> 11:45.534
Well, great.

11:46.034 --> 11:46.655
Good.

11:46.795 --> 11:51.400
Everybody, when they got, both of them, when they got through, they all cheered and so forth.

11:51.548 --> 11:55.694
Any other celebrity anecdotes you remember?

11:55.955 --> 12:02.705
I can remember Peter, Paul, and Mary came here one time and almost didn't get here.

12:02.725 --> 12:16.687
One of them was stopped by the famous Calvert police up here on their way down here, and they were to fly out of here, and one of them was afraid to fly.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.311
I've forgotten now why, but

12:19.730 --> 12:21.412
There was a problem with them.

12:23.095 --> 12:31.967
John, not John Denver, John Davidson was here one time and announced his engagement, I think, from the stage of town hall.

12:33.850 --> 12:37.115
And then there was a piano player.

12:37.555 --> 12:41.000
What was his name?

12:41.020 --> 12:41.961
He's well known.

12:42.883 --> 12:44.505
But he cut his hands.

12:45.076 --> 12:48.300
did a glissando, cut his hands.

12:49.422 --> 12:55.029
And he, I was standing near the stage and he came off, something else was going on.

12:55.089 --> 12:58.714
He was standing there and I had to tell him his hand was bleeding.

12:59.656 --> 13:02.559
And then he realized there was blood all over the keyboard.

13:03.501 --> 13:11.151
So we had to kind of stop and clean off the keyboard with his blood.

13:11.857 --> 13:38.995
and then i'm not sure there was one of these groups where the drummer was deathly afraid of june bugs and this was before g riley white was air conditioned and we had to stop the concert then to do something to the june bugs i don't know what you can do to get rid of june bugs but we we did something but there was interesting things dealing with these people uh

13:39.802 --> 13:53.260
Let's see, I remember Johnny Rivers came here one time and I always dealt with the, you know, the money end of it and having to settle up and write their checks and this sort of thing.

13:53.280 --> 14:00.730
Nothing other than that you would expect, I guess, I remember.

14:00.951 --> 14:08.020
When, or in settling, as you phrase it, settling up, when did you give them payment for a performance?

14:09.097 --> 14:15.244
Just as soon as we determined how many tickets were sold and how many people... Was it while they were here?

14:15.464 --> 14:17.787
Oh, yes, yes.

14:18.408 --> 14:25.356
Do you remember any big fiscal successes and fiscal flops in terms of concert costs?

14:26.177 --> 14:27.478
No, not really.

14:27.939 --> 14:30.562
One, I remember we miscounted the tickets.

14:31.823 --> 14:36.268
Johnny Rivers, I think it was, who was a big name at the time.

14:37.109 --> 14:41.916
And we miscounted the tickets, and we came up way short on that.

14:42.817 --> 14:50.808
But all we did was notify them, and they said, you know, there was a whole batch of tickets over here that didn't get counted that should have been a refund.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.852
They just sent us a check for whatever we wanted.

14:53.912 --> 14:58.639
I can remember seeing that check signed by Johnny Rivers, and I was so glad.

14:59.701 --> 15:05.128
As you think back, what were some of the highest fees we paid in that era?

15:05.168 --> 15:05.749
Do you remember?

15:08.294 --> 15:13.039
$10, $12,000, which was, I think, big at the time.

15:13.679 --> 15:17.563
Now you're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars for those things now.

15:17.583 --> 15:26.212
$12,000 sounds big to me now, 30 years ago, nearly 40 years ago.

15:26.252 --> 15:30.596
And I remember G. Raleigh being filled regularly.

15:31.517 --> 15:34.600
Do you remember, were you there the night the lights went off?

15:34.700 --> 15:34.980
Yes.

15:35.421 --> 15:37.963
Leon Bibb?

15:38.348 --> 15:50.282
When he in the stillness of the night he began to sing To quail what I did You know the lights went off all over the campus.

15:50.463 --> 16:03.158
I went over to the gift shop MSC looking for candles if you remember the gift shop a lot of glass and stuff around well, I got into the building and

16:03.813 --> 16:21.512
or had a key to the gift shop and was in there feeling for candles among all this glass and paraphernalia and was successful, came back with, I'm sure they were very expensive candles, came back over there.

16:21.532 --> 16:26.297
By the time I got back over there, there had some semblance of lights going again.

16:26.317 --> 16:28.099
I don't remember what it was.

16:28.467 --> 16:32.031
Whether we use those candles or not, I don't even remember.

16:32.471 --> 16:42.862
But it was from that concert, though, that they did install emergency battery lights so that if they ever went out again, these things would come on automatically.

16:43.583 --> 16:48.368
Now, you're in this chief business manager task for how long, 60?

16:48.748 --> 16:57.597
I left in 69, fall of 69, became the payroll manager for the Manium System at the time there.

16:57.577 --> 17:05.608
All right, during those years that you were working on the campus, what was A&M doing right?

17:05.808 --> 17:10.635
What were the decisions that in hindsight looked like?

17:10.655 --> 17:12.037
What were they doing right?

17:12.057 --> 17:14.100
Yeah.

17:14.380 --> 17:21.610
And then later I'm going to ask, were there any that we, where we made a mistake or there were some that we passed by?

17:24.155 --> 17:26.438
Like we coeducated during that women?

17:26.458 --> 17:26.799
Yes.

17:27.460 --> 17:30.064
During 1960, we did three things.

17:30.564 --> 17:42.682
Of course, we racially integrated women and changed the name all within, what, mid-60s there, within almost a few months, certainly within a year of each other.

17:42.982 --> 17:45.446
What did you and your colleagues think about those changes?

17:46.067 --> 17:48.190
Oh, great, great.

17:48.210 --> 17:52.356
Because in the racial thing,

17:53.180 --> 18:08.357
you know, we had groups come in from off campus and I remember Ann Keel spent time determining, you know, were there any blacks involved with this group and if so, we had to handle this thing a certain way.

18:08.758 --> 18:10.500
So that just did away with that.

18:10.780 --> 18:19.851
We had our own black dining room downstairs and then in the minute that was just done away with immediately.

18:19.871 --> 18:21.853
Do you remember any incidents?

18:22.272 --> 18:23.314
from integration?

18:23.394 --> 18:23.754
I don't.

18:24.335 --> 18:27.941
We remembered someone was on the way here one time.

18:28.021 --> 18:32.447
We got word they'd cause some trouble like over at Temple or somewhere.

18:33.729 --> 18:34.811
They never got here.

18:36.153 --> 18:40.760
I do remember Dr. Evans who was president of Prairie View.

18:40.780 --> 18:41.742
Do you remember him?

18:41.802 --> 18:51.216
He would come up and meet with the board and there was always special handling and they would try to get him to

18:51.803 --> 18:53.728
And he wouldn't.

18:54.049 --> 18:58.941
He would always separate himself from the other group, some way or another.

18:59.222 --> 19:04.555
But yet here he was, you know, a marvelously educated, wonderful person.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.445
But he always,

19:08.847 --> 19:27.666
did not want to infringe upon uh this situation and he he didn't but as far as anything else we never experienced anything all right well and i'm particularly asking now once black students came do you remember any incidents in the hallways or anything

19:28.372 --> 19:30.034
I'm sure they occurred.

19:30.074 --> 19:31.094
But I never heard of any.

19:31.115 --> 19:33.457
But I was never aware of anything.

19:33.877 --> 19:35.418
All right, then with co-education.

19:36.219 --> 19:37.580
Oh, now that was a problem.

19:38.461 --> 19:39.903
See, there were no facilities.

19:40.223 --> 19:44.046
There were no women's restrooms on the, at the MSC.

19:44.547 --> 19:48.891
But, you know, academic building, there were no women's restrooms over there, nowhere.

19:50.212 --> 19:56.758
How easily were you all able to involve women in the MSC activities?

20:00.080 --> 20:02.484
Really, that came after I left.

20:02.524 --> 20:08.634
The bulk of that occurred after 69, and I can't really respond to that.

20:09.495 --> 20:16.307
I'm still trying to think of what did A&M do right in this whole period of time.

20:16.327 --> 20:21.675
I'm not sure I can answer that.

20:21.695 --> 20:23.779
What did you and your colleagues think about the name change?

20:25.061 --> 20:26.323
Oh, I thought it was great.

20:27.215 --> 20:28.216
I mean, it's so much easier.

20:28.236 --> 20:35.223
I mean, you spell agricultural and the mechanical college of Texas at College Station, Texas.

20:35.603 --> 20:37.244
I mean, that's a mouthful.

20:37.885 --> 20:39.847
You know, it took extra room.

20:39.887 --> 20:47.474
And even the school system was the A&M consolidated independent school district of College Station at Texas.

20:47.534 --> 20:51.218
You know, you wore out your typewriter trying to get to the end of it.

20:51.238 --> 20:54.741
Mr. Rutter, in my last conversation with him,

20:55.295 --> 20:59.121
before his, what turned out to be his fatal illness.

20:59.642 --> 21:07.935
I was over there as chairman of the library committee trying to get more money, and his first response was, do you think the students have read all the books they've already got?

21:09.477 --> 21:11.180
I can see him saying that.

21:11.741 --> 21:19.733
And then we started talking about those changes, and he said if you guys had recommended the name LSU has, it would have been approved.

21:20.877 --> 21:21.718
What was that?

21:22.279 --> 21:24.622
And I said, you mean Louisiana State University?

21:24.642 --> 21:25.483
They've got that.

21:25.503 --> 21:26.565
And he said, no, no, no.

21:27.246 --> 21:35.457
If you all had recommended Texas State University and Agricultural Mechanical College, he said, that's the official name of the school at Baton Rouge.

21:35.918 --> 21:36.419
You're kidding.

21:36.879 --> 21:37.701
No, I didn't know.

21:37.721 --> 21:38.261
How awful that is.

21:38.642 --> 21:43.549
Well, he said, then we could have still, us old timers, could have still talked about being at A&M.

21:44.410 --> 21:47.574
And you youngsters could be at Texas State or whatever you wanted to call it.

21:48.576 --> 21:50.158
And he said it would have sailed right through.

21:50.864 --> 21:53.126
I never even heard that.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.367
I never did either.

21:54.387 --> 22:06.179
When I interviewed Wayne Hall the other day, he said that he thought he was the one, he, Wayne, was the one who came up with the idea of just using the A and M. Without the periods.

22:06.199 --> 22:11.865
Without the periods and without the A and D. And that Mr. Rudder liked that.

22:11.965 --> 22:20.533
He said that Mr. Rudder, in fact, he thought had more trouble accepting the name change

22:21.188 --> 22:22.591
than any of the other changes.

22:23.293 --> 22:23.674
Really?

22:23.874 --> 22:25.518
Yeah.

22:25.558 --> 22:35.181
When it finally came down to it, he thought that, and I wasn't aware of that, and I've run into a few other people of that generation

22:35.735 --> 22:42.965
who didn't want to lose those magic initials A and M. Well, but they didn't.

22:42.985 --> 22:43.926
No, no.

22:43.946 --> 22:48.492
That's why the name change that we have, that they would accept it.

22:48.552 --> 22:50.695
I thought it was a clever transition.

22:50.715 --> 22:51.176
I did, too.

22:51.416 --> 22:53.539
I did, too, in hindsight.

22:53.559 --> 23:01.209
And I tell people that when I read the paper and I read UCLA, my brain doesn't say University of California at Los Angeles.

23:02.872 --> 23:04.594
Or when I see a grocery product,

23:05.097 --> 23:06.359
like AT&T.

23:06.439 --> 23:07.540
I don't translate that.

23:07.740 --> 23:09.583
That's just those initials are the name.

23:10.304 --> 23:17.653
And so A&M to me is, now I don't, I type TAMU, but I don't say TAMU.

23:17.753 --> 23:18.574
I say A&M.

23:18.794 --> 23:19.235
Yeah.

23:19.996 --> 23:21.618
Well, I do too.

23:21.658 --> 23:34.294
Can you think of any opportunities that you recall A&M and or the MSC or any other part of the school had in the 60s that we did not utilize?

23:36.873 --> 23:37.934
Oh, goodness.

23:42.040 --> 24:04.551
You know, in my mind, I can think there must have been zillions of them, but to come up with something now 40 years later here, you know, I guess we were dealing, and it was 10 years behind in its growth pattern, at least 10 years, I guess, wasn't it?

24:05.223 --> 24:13.253
And there have been bound to have been, of course, I guess it was the girl thing that probably was the key thing there more than anything.

24:13.293 --> 24:29.272
On that Aspirations Committee where I served, and I was the draft, I wrote the report, Bart Nelson supervised a questionnaire every high school junior and senior between Conroe and East Dallas, 32 counties.

24:30.134 --> 24:34.639
We found a direct correlation between the higher of the students' grades

24:35.041 --> 24:39.034
and the lower the student's interest in going to an all-male or an all-female school.

24:39.616 --> 24:40.840
They want to go to a co-ed school.

24:41.422 --> 24:46.097
The higher the student's grades, the lower the student's interest in anything compulsory.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.360
Don't tell me I've got to be in the Corps.

24:48.681 --> 24:50.203
I'm in the top 10% of my class.

24:50.624 --> 24:51.705
I want to choose one.

24:51.986 --> 24:52.667
That's still true.

24:52.687 --> 24:54.009
Sure.

24:54.029 --> 25:03.583
And we also found that the average student didn't know that A&M offered anything other than agriculture, engineering, and veterinary medicine.

25:04.024 --> 25:10.133
And as one kid, I always use this one, he summarized it well in his report, his questionnaire.

25:10.173 --> 25:16.422
He said, no girls, no fraternity, no fun, no way.

25:16.402 --> 25:23.813
And they thought College Station was a quiet, dreary, which wasn't too far from the truth.

25:24.130 --> 25:31.458
Now, we realize College Station and Bryan are in the middle of the big population triangle.

25:31.478 --> 25:32.018
Yes, sir.

25:32.119 --> 25:33.560
We're nicely located.

25:35.282 --> 25:35.662
Let's see.

25:36.803 --> 25:45.973
When you would work with Mr. Rutter and his staff, would he be open to a new idea?

25:46.033 --> 25:47.235
Would he listen?

25:48.236 --> 25:49.497
He always listens.

25:50.894 --> 25:54.641
and analyze it, I think, pretty thoroughly.

25:56.164 --> 25:58.830
Probably wouldn't respond immediately.

25:58.850 --> 26:01.535
He'd come back later with something.

26:01.876 --> 26:03.819
He'd check with other people.

26:04.781 --> 26:06.765
But I always listened.

26:07.186 --> 26:10.793
I think was an excellent listener and would relate.

26:11.583 --> 26:14.145
I don't think you went away disappointed.

26:14.185 --> 26:17.989
You would understand his viewpoint when you got through.

26:18.029 --> 26:26.677
Did he have any pet peeves, any pet ideas that everybody needed to be careful about?

26:27.137 --> 26:38.788
If somebody didn't act right, I mean, when you see stuff going on up there now that people turn their eyes and ears to,

26:39.258 --> 26:43.602
Earl would not have tolerated it at all if he became aware of it.

26:44.043 --> 26:45.564
Of course, you can't do that now.

26:45.584 --> 26:47.666
I mean, legally, you'd get shot or murdered.

26:47.686 --> 26:58.617
All right, if you all wanted to be sure that the proposal was well received, who were the key staff members around Mr. Rutter that you checked with?

27:02.361 --> 27:02.802
Goodness.

27:04.163 --> 27:09.248
Of course, it was always, when I was there, Tom Cherry was,

27:10.443 --> 27:11.445
Financially.

27:11.585 --> 27:14.009
Financially, idea-wise.

27:15.752 --> 27:17.835
Like, did y'all check with Ed Cooper?

27:19.698 --> 27:24.185
Did you check with Dorsey McCrory, with Dean Hannigan?

27:25.067 --> 27:28.652
Now, I only kind of see, we're preceding these people.

27:28.712 --> 27:30.876
My period is preceding them.

27:30.896 --> 27:35.303
Ed came in later, so did Dorsey McCrory.

27:35.620 --> 27:46.793
I was in a meeting one time and speaking of Dorsey McCrory in the Koch building and had to do with the, I guess the design and concept of the new MSC.

27:46.933 --> 27:59.808
I was on, or at least met with, I don't know if it was on the committee, but I met with, but I can remember the first time that Dorsey McCrory became aware of the fact that he was going to be in the tower over there.

28:00.889 --> 28:05.374
And Mr. Rudder told him in this, you know, just someone sitting there talking,

28:06.198 --> 28:12.488
And Dorsey didn't take to that, because then this tower was, you know, what is that thing over there, you know?

28:13.830 --> 28:15.753
And he didn't take to it too well.

28:16.955 --> 28:28.813
And I can remember another meeting we had, Don Jarvis was talking about, you know, these concepts and things, and the first mention of a fountain.

28:29.806 --> 28:38.576
And here, you know, Earl Rudder and Wes Donaldson and all the people were in this meeting, quite a good size room in that old boardroom in the system building.

28:41.399 --> 28:45.224
You know, you can just see this going around the room.

28:45.264 --> 28:46.325
Going around the room.

28:46.766 --> 28:47.607
Well, there it is.

28:47.667 --> 28:48.407
It's there now.

28:49.088 --> 28:52.272
And it was Sterling Evans who got the tower built.

28:53.253 --> 28:57.518
Jarvis came with a plan pretty well, a bulky plan.

28:58.308 --> 29:15.118
you know two or three or four stories maybe spread out but Sterling had been up east somewhere and he'd seen a tower somewhere and he came back and he thought we ought to have a tower so back to the drawing board Don went and that's

29:15.520 --> 29:16.883
how the tower got there.

29:16.903 --> 29:18.607
It was through Sterling's suggestion.

29:18.627 --> 29:32.719
And I remember at one of those meetings, Ed Romanek raising the issue that that project did not have as part of its task designing parking facility or anything for the people that would use it.

29:32.699 --> 29:38.908
That was not part of the... And he was bright in thinking of that, too.

29:38.928 --> 29:43.294
That was not originally, nobody originally said, and keep that in mind.

29:43.975 --> 29:47.139
All right, let's see, on three or four more things.

29:48.421 --> 29:51.805
We've talked about any missed opportunities.

29:53.448 --> 29:57.373
Well, I didn't name you any, I can't, other than just...

29:57.809 --> 30:01.775
not grasping to the things that they ultimately did, you know, they were slow.

30:01.875 --> 30:15.835
And be thinking about, when we get this rough draft back to you, about any anecdotes that will help to give examples of, whether it's student good bull or something that just doesn't work out.

30:15.975 --> 30:17.758
Okay, that would be very precious.

30:17.778 --> 30:19.560
I know I'll come up with something.

30:19.661 --> 30:26.871
What are the events, the activities, that tie almost every

30:27.307 --> 30:37.498
A&M person together, regardless of their class, year, their major, their, what are the events?

30:37.518 --> 30:38.539
You mean even now?

30:38.799 --> 30:39.980
Yeah, even now.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.362
Well, sports, certainly.

30:41.402 --> 30:41.842
Okay.

30:42.643 --> 30:46.327
Of course, the Association of Former Students, the relationship there.

30:51.372 --> 30:52.574
Specific events, though.

30:53.014 --> 30:55.677
Specific events during the year.

31:00.702 --> 31:02.907
graduation, of course the muster.

31:03.649 --> 31:07.940
Okay, that's the kind of thing I'm thinking about.

31:08.601 --> 31:15.859
What is there about our commencements that warm their hearts more than some other schools?

31:17.122 --> 31:33.949
fact that they have them and that they call every name and shake every hand yeah now how long are we going to do this though i can hope we do it forever well i can see this waning though because i fear you're correct uh i like the idea but now the only other

31:34.537 --> 31:45.361
graduation ceremonies I will go to, maybe my grandchildren, you know, to sit there that whole time is real tough, real tough.

31:45.662 --> 31:47.145
Am I correct though?
