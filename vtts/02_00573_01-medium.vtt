00:03.355 --> 00:11.482
This is an interview with Gabor Nagy by Catherine 
Mays on November 24, 1990, at his home concerning

00:03.355 --> 00:11.482
the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In the interest 
of accumulating knowledge, I am asking you to

00:11.583 --> 00:20.671
donate this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral 
History Collection in the University Archives.

00:21.091 --> 00:21.792
Is that all right with you? Yes, it is. All right, 
let's begin with where were you born and when? I was

00:27.357 --> 00:31.641
born in Hungary on the 5th of June, 1941. My father 
was a tool and die maker who worked in the same

00:32.347 --> 00:45.340
factory ever since he was 12 years old and my mother 
was a seamstress who was working out of her home to

00:32.347 --> 00:45.340
make some extra money. So what was life growing up 
in Hungary? Growing up was it was a very hard life.

00:58.272 --> 00:59.113
My father And my parents never owed anything, you 
know, and everything was...

00:59.600 --> 01:11.811
Everything we had, they had to work real hard for. 
They didn't have any personal possession. They

01:14.334 --> 01:16.456
could never own a house or... The only thing my 
father had, the best of his possession was a

01:16.536 --> 01:26.485
bicycle. I mean really he didn't have anything. 
Bicycle he had.

01:34.693 --> 01:42.084
He had the bicycle that he used to go to work on and my 
mother had a sewing machine. And the apartment

01:43.746 --> 01:50.616
where we worked was affiliated to us by the

01:50.984 --> 01:53.807
the factory where my father was working. In other 
words, they took so much of your wages off, and then

01:54.007 --> 02:10.483
they provided the rental was taken out of the 
wages, the medical insurance, the fees for that

01:54.007 --> 02:10.483
was taken out of his wages. And by the time he 
brought the money home, it was hardly enough to

02:10.864 --> 02:18.571
make it from one paycheck to the next. So it was a 
hard life. So what were the effects when

02:22.253 --> 02:27.840
Khrushchev came in and he started announcing his 
destalinization policies? Were you all aware of

02:27.900 --> 02:29.482
these policies? I faintly remember these things 
because I was still a youngster and it was in the

02:30.343 --> 02:51.147
earlier days and I was only about, I would say, 
eight to ten years old, just barely, you know,

02:30.343 --> 02:51.147
starting my years as a student, you know. a 
school-aged child, but I heard my father

02:51.616 --> 02:57.786
mentioning certain things about it, you know. 
They didn't like the way Stalin was doing. He

03:04.115 --> 03:10.205
forced his ideals on everybody and killed a lot of 
people. I think Stalin was much worse in his own

03:14.903 --> 03:36.827
ways than Hitler ever was because everything that 
Hitler did came onto the surface, you know, all the

03:14.903 --> 03:36.827
stuff that Stalin did was just, you know, buried 
away and it was just, you know, it was pretty bad and

03:14.903 --> 03:36.827
we didn't feel too We felt pretty good that 
de-Stalinization was going to start and we were

03:37.297 --> 03:51.094
going to bury it away with his death in 1953, but 
communism didn't change that much. People were

03:51.494 --> 03:58.883
still starving, people were still overworked, 
they didn't get enough wages for their work. It was

03:59.690 --> 04:05.480
just another phase of communism as far as, you 
know, Hungary was concerned. So you'd say you

04:05.500 --> 04:08.304
wanted complete freedom from communism? Yes, 
yes, we did want to complete freedom from it, and

04:08.324 --> 04:22.828
de-Stalinization probably was a step toward 
total freedom, but it was, you know, we had a whole

04:08.324 --> 04:22.828
long ways to go. And how did the other countries, 
Poland, Austria, and Yugoslavia, how did those

04:23.652 --> 04:32.324
countries who had somewhat more freedom make the 
people of Hungary feel? Well, those people, you

04:32.344 --> 04:39.253
know, we were all in the same kind of regime. We were 
all under communistic rule, you know. But those

04:43.118 --> 04:53.372
nations, you know, they felt the pain that Hungary 
felt, and we were all trying to, you know, I

04:43.118 --> 04:53.372
guess... Like a big family, you know, we all 
comforted one another and we were all looking for a

04:54.280 --> 05:13.605
way out of it and that's what the Hungarian 
Revolution of 1956 started, you know, and

04:54.280 --> 05:13.605
everybody benefited from it. Do you feel it began 
with the students or with all of the people of

05:13.940 --> 05:18.050
Hungary? I think that at the beginning the 
students really kindled the flame to get

05:18.350 --> 05:30.278
something started, especially the students of 
Poland, who had a big demonstration on the 23rd of

05:30.832 --> 05:43.124
October, 1956, that really started the youth of 
the Hungarian universities on the same track. And

05:43.424 --> 05:47.368
they also started a big uprising the following 
day. And then all

05:47.948 --> 06:00.180
this, the news got around throughout the nation, 
and the workers When my father worked, for

06:00.852 --> 06:13.130
instance, he was the big organizer to get the 
strike started, which backed up the students in

06:00.852 --> 06:13.130
their demands. What changes did the students and 
the people of Hungary want to see in 1956? Well, the

06:19.039 --> 06:25.248
students had a proclamation a couple days after 
the revolution started. I think it was on the

06:25.308 --> 06:30.015
second or the third day they had a 12-point demand 
that they put in front of the...

06:30.417 --> 06:42.449
that the people were demanding, you know. And one 
of the demands were freedom of the press, freedom

06:42.989 --> 06:49.375
of religion, freedom of speech. And they just 
wanted a total freedom away from all the... You

06:50.156 --> 06:59.665
know, they didn't want the KBG to go... go in the 
middle of the night and arresting people. They

07:04.715 --> 07:10.940
just wanted a total freedom of all of that. What 
kind of leader did you feel in the students'

07:12.222 --> 07:17.446
village that Imre Nagy was going to be for your 
country? Well, Imre Nagy, he was a good person who

07:17.766 --> 07:30.057
was in

07:17.766 --> 07:30.057
parliament previous to the 1956 revolution and he 
was one of the persons who wanted the total freedom

07:30.374 --> 07:58.862
from communism and his government he was you know 
after the revolution started which was a very

07:30.374 --> 07:58.862
short lived because it ended in a couple of weeks 
time but he he He wanted what the student wanted,

08:00.378 --> 08:15.940
and then the total abolishment of communism and 
all the points that the students put forth, he

08:00.378 --> 08:15.940
acknowledged them. So when he was put in as premier 
of Hungary, how did the people feel when Nagy

08:16.527 --> 08:45.268
was... Oh, they were overwhelmed, and everybody 
thought that the revolution's going to survive,

08:16.527 --> 08:45.268
and they started to open up all the prisons, so the 
prisoners, political prisoners, went free, and

08:16.527 --> 08:45.268
they really looked forward to... to a new way of 
life. So when the Soviets began to intervene, and

08:48.987 --> 08:54.953
they started coming in, what were your first 
memories? Well, it was pretty bad. See, I lived in

08:57.115 --> 09:09.168
Debrecen at the time, which was the eastern part of 
Hungary, and that was really close to the Russian

08:57.115 --> 09:09.168
border, about, I would say, about 10, 15 miles, 
that's all. And it was really bad because... One of

09:14.510 --> 09:24.908
the points of the student proclamation was to 
break away from the

09:26.255 --> 09:47.014
break away from the Warsaw Pact, which stated that 
the Soviet troops were allowed to stay in Hungary,

09:26.255 --> 09:47.014
you know, and the student says, we don't want the 
Warsaw Pact, we want to break away from it, we want

09:26.255 --> 09:47.014
the Russians out of the country, you know, out of 
Hungary. And when I saw the Russians coming back

09:49.545 --> 09:55.835
in, we knew that there was something, some 
trouble. Now, what had happened is that while Imre

09:56.076 --> 10:11.922
Nagy was the premier, another government was 
formed secretly behind him who asked the Russians

09:56.076 --> 10:11.922
help. that's how come the Russians the tanks 
started coming in you know and that's that's that

10:12.526 --> 10:42.246
was the turning point when the Hungarian 
Revolution you know when the Soviets intervened

10:12.526 --> 10:42.246
that's when the Soviets intervened and that was 
like on a Sunday of November 4th and Monday

10:12.526 --> 10:42.246
November 5th when when the Russian tanks were just 
coming back in you know and then they broke down the

10:12.526 --> 10:42.246
revolution When Nagy asked the revolutionaries, 
he's like, you know, stop, you know, stop

10:42.665 --> 10:48.717
fighting. Did you feel like he was just being 
influenced by the Russians by, you know, saying,

10:50.000 --> 10:56.974
asking, just wanting the revolution to be 
stopped? Well, Imre Nagy, at the beginning, he had

10:57.114 --> 11:02.665
to kind of...

11:04.433 --> 11:34.018
pleased both parties at the beginning because he 
wanted to have the wanted to please the existing

11:04.433 --> 11:34.018
government and on the other hand he was he was 
really in favor of the revolution and in the

11:04.433 --> 11:34.018
beginning he was kinda was telling everybody 
actually to stop fighting is not a bad thing to ask

11:04.433 --> 11:34.018
you know you can stop fighting and you can resolve 
your problems or resolve your requests as a you

11:04.433 --> 11:34.018
know at a diplomatic way, you know, and so stop 
fighting wasn't a bad request, you know, and you

11:34.353 --> 11:44.784
know we would all, you know, wanted to do that. So 
you did want to stop fighting? We did want to stop

11:48.022 --> 11:52.007
the fight and then resolve it legally. And they did 
stop fighting. But when the Russian tanks came

11:55.873 --> 12:03.883
back in, that's when things were kind of lost. You 
couldn't fight against the tanks and everything.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.093
So that kind of put an end to it. What were some of 
your memories? Do you have memories of the... Oh

12:13.146 --> 12:16.453
yes, there's a... This section really could go on 
for hours and hours, because I can expand on the

12:16.613 --> 12:30.702
revolution, you know, as little as it short-lived 
it was, but there was a lot of things happened over

12:16.613 --> 12:30.702
there, really. If you want me to expand on certain 
parts of it, maybe we can do that. You want me to do

12:38.157 --> 12:40.839
that now, or is it... No, go ahead. Expand on some of 
the memories you have of the days of the

12:40.920 --> 12:45.785
revolution. The earlier days of the revolution 
was very trying because there was a lot of street

12:45.845 --> 12:57.077
fighting, and as I earlier said, my father was... 
working in this, uh, locomotive factory as a tool

12:57.395 --> 13:01.200
and die maker. And he was the person who organized 
one of the major strikes in Davidson, uh, because

13:01.681 --> 13:16.080
this factory employed about 10,000 people and 
they were all, all workers. And my father was

13:16.180 --> 13:22.068
working there from, uh, when he was 12 years old 
until that time. And, uh, 56, he was, he was about,

13:22.929 --> 13:26.153
uh, 40 years old at the time, you know. Actually he 
was, yeah, well anyway, and he was like a foreman

13:31.882 --> 13:42.216
and he had a lot of influence with the people. And I 
remember He told the people to go on strike and the

13:45.809 --> 14:08.121
next couple of days they took my father away in jail 
and then they held him there until he releases a

13:45.809 --> 14:08.121
statement to the press that the people would go 
back to work, that he would ask the workers to go

13:45.809 --> 14:08.121
back to work. he would not he wouldn't do that so 
they kept him in jail he was in jail for about a week

14:08.101 --> 14:28.101
you know until close to the end of the month in you 
know until like October 28th or 29th you know of

14:08.101 --> 14:28.101
1956 and then he decided

14:28.942 --> 14:45.563
and when he found that things were starting to 
deteriorate and everything, he did sign a

14:28.942 --> 14:45.563
statement and told the people to go back to work, 
you know, but it wasn't really a statement that he

14:28.942 --> 14:45.563
wanted to really do. He knew that the revolution 
was kind of doomed anyway. This was his way of

14:49.248 --> 14:53.333
getting out of prison, you know. So when they let 
him out, That's when my father came home that very

14:55.418 --> 15:00.524
night, and we picked up all our belongings. I have a 
sister who is a year younger than I am. He also lives

15:03.207 --> 15:07.551
in Haltom City, and he works with General Dynamics 
now. But just the four of us with all the money that

15:08.172 --> 15:20.465
my mother and father, all their savings, and just a 
coat on our backs and a suitcase, so we took off. And

15:21.006 --> 15:24.750
then we came out from Debrecet, from Debra's end to 
the iron

15:25.118 --> 15:32.390
curtain. The iron curtain was nothing more than a 
fence, an electrified fence of about six foot high

15:32.410 --> 15:44.190
that

15:44.575 --> 15:50.926
It was called the Iron Curtain, you know, and that 
was from the western. That was about three to four

15:51.427 --> 15:57.959
hundred miles long along the western part of 
Hungary. Mostly, the most fortified area was

15:58.300 --> 16:02.888
around Austria. Austria and actually the border 
between Hungary and Austria is not very large but

16:03.239 --> 16:13.277
the border was going around more on the western 
part of it. But anyway, so we took a train from

16:13.718 --> 16:25.298
Debrecen to Austrian border which is about I would 
say about 300 miles and being my father a

16:26.037 --> 16:55.926
locomotive factory worker he was able to start a 
freedom train from Debrecen all the way to through

16:26.037 --> 16:55.926
Budapest to western part of Hungary and this train 
started and everybody got loaded up in Debrecen

16:26.037 --> 16:55.926
the whole train about 15

16:57.728 --> 17:04.879
cars, you know, and then we all went and they didn't 
stop until it got to the other side. And about 50

17:05.079 --> 17:24.107
miles from the western border we

17:05.079 --> 17:24.107
heard the news that there are some Russians at 
Sopron, which is the very final city, you know,

17:05.079 --> 17:24.107
before Austria. that there were people over there 
waiting for the train to come through so they can

17:24.239 --> 17:29.807
arrest everybody. So what happened at this point, 
the train stopped, and everybody got out, and we

17:30.408 --> 17:41.844
took the rest of the way, the last good 50 miles. 
Well, actually, I don't remember exactly how much

17:41.944 --> 17:46.411
it was, but we walked all night. I mean, all night 
long through... fields and no streets. I mean, it

17:51.861 --> 17:53.823
was pitch dark. It wasn't a night where there was a 
full moon. I mean, I was just petrified because one

17:57.828 --> 18:06.739
time I lost my, I lost contact. I hold my sister's 
hand, but my sister wasn't holding my father's

18:06.759 --> 18:11.184
hand. So kind of, but anyway, I was already 15 years 
old, so I wasn't really that scared, but my sister

18:11.625 --> 18:18.073
was started to cry. She was 14, but she cried. But 
anyway, and then we came to this, we had to stop.

18:27.905 --> 18:45.304
During the day, we hid in fields of hay, you know, 
and we were waiting for the night to come, and that

18:27.905 --> 18:45.304
evening, we were hiding a whole day in the fields, 
and we didn't dare go out, you know. We hardly ate

18:45.784 --> 18:48.347
anything, too, I remember that. and at night we 
went to this village and we knocked on people's

18:48.918 --> 19:15.263
door trying to ask them directions how to get to uh 
how to get over to Austria you know and finally this

18:48.918 --> 19:15.263
person says oh I'll I'll get you over there I know 
exactly the way how to go and everything and my

18:48.918 --> 19:15.263
mother gave all the all the money that we had 
because we didn't have any use for it in Austria and

18:48.918 --> 19:15.263
uh he He got lost and we got caught. I mean, we were 
caught, you know. And when we were walking over

19:23.374 --> 19:30.905
there, all of a sudden a flashlight shines into my 
father's face and asked him where they were going,

19:23.374 --> 19:30.905
you know. So my father didn't answer. He said, if 
you don't know where you're going, you know, you

19:38.345 --> 20:07.491
don't need to ask that question you know where 
we're going so then we got arrested you see and then

19:38.345 --> 20:07.491
we got to this place where they were about it was a 
border patrol station and there were about 20 30

19:38.345 --> 20:07.491
people already arrested that night over there we 
were the only people as a as a as a family you know

19:38.345 --> 20:07.491
everybody was kind of like single you know and uh it 
was very sad my mother was crying and everything

19:38.345 --> 20:07.491
and later on uh The place, gunshots were fired, you 
know, and we thought that perhaps the place was

20:09.074 --> 20:20.606
attacked by freedom fighters, so we're going to be 
all freed again. But it wasn't the case. The

20:22.348 --> 20:37.444
lieutenant who was the

20:22.348 --> 20:37.444
controlling person of the border, he came in drunk 
and he was shooting his gun in the dark, you know. So

20:37.762 --> 21:04.562
at that time, my mother went in and took a bottle 
of... We got a little whiskey, a couple of bottles

20:37.762 --> 21:04.562
of whiskey, because my godfather had a 
restaurant, and he had some whiskey and some

20:37.762 --> 21:04.562
brandy hidden away, you know, because they took 
his...

21:06.179 --> 21:09.979
restaurant away, you know, it was more like a pub, 
you know. and uh but he had some hidden whiskey and

21:10.398 --> 21:38.177
gave us a couple of bottles and my mother gave one of 
the bottles to the guy who was drunk and in return he

21:10.398 --> 21:38.177
he would ask us he asked if he if he would let us go you 
know and he did you know and he let us go and he even

21:10.398 --> 21:38.177
gave a soldier to to show us through the border you 
know because we were the only family you know

21:10.398 --> 21:38.177
everybody was single so He probably figured, 
well, you know, he's got reasons that he... If he

21:42.398 --> 22:00.034
would have gotten sent back to Debrecen, my father 
would have probably gotten a bad sentence or

21:42.398 --> 22:00.034
either life or he was... A lot of people were 
sentenced to life imprisonment or sent to

21:42.398 --> 22:00.034
Siberia, you know, or executed. This we found out 
after he got settled in America, you know. But

22:05.859 --> 22:07.540
anyway, it's... That's how we got across and we got 
to Austria. There are a lot of things happened in

22:11.766 --> 22:14.989
Austria. And if you want me to expand on that, I can. 
I was going to ask you, this time during the

22:21.795 --> 22:28.641
revolution, did you feel that other countries 
should come to your aid? Or did you all think they

22:28.782 --> 22:31.064
were going to come to your aid? Well, during the 
course of the revolution, Radio Free Europe had

22:36.308 --> 22:55.694
mentioned and pleaded several times with the 
United Nations and specifically to Hungary, to

22:36.308 --> 22:55.694
the United States, to interfere and to liberate 
the Hungarian people. And it was a big, big

22:56.455 --> 23:05.607
disappointment that nobody came to the help of the 
Hungarian people. But later on, you know, the

23:06.143 --> 23:19.287
people realized that really, if they would have 
interfered with Hungary, it would have been

23:06.143 --> 23:19.287
interference with the whole Soviet Union. So it 
would have been a little bit bigger deal than just

23:19.307 --> 23:25.900
taking care of the Hungarian people. I'm sure 
that... the Russians would have, you know, really

23:27.338 --> 23:38.295
gotten, you know, on the side of the Hungarians and 
it would have, could have, you know, start the

23:27.338 --> 23:38.295
Third World War. So with this in view, you know, it 
probably was better that the United Nations

23:38.415 --> 23:48.631
didn't come, you know, because it could have 
started the Third World War. But it was a big

23:49.092 --> 23:53.338
disappointment because, you know, we lost our 
freedom. We had it for two weeks and that was it. So

23:55.975 --> 23:58.818
you were able to listen to Radio Free Europe? You 
did have access to it? Radio Free, yes. We had

24:01.481 --> 24:16.719
access to Radio Free Europe in those two weeks 
because they were constantly jamming the signal

24:01.481 --> 24:16.719
and not much of the stuff was coming through. But 
during the course of the revolution, you know, it

24:16.759 --> 24:21.544
was pretty clear, yes. So you were able to get to the 
United States. You can go ahead and expand. Yes.

24:28.127 --> 24:31.169
OK, well, just shortly, I don't want to take up too 
much time. But in Austria, when we came to Austria,

24:31.189 --> 24:46.323
the Austrian people were so good to help to pave the 
way of these people who came from Hungary. During

24:47.484 --> 24:52.408
the course of the revolution, about 150,000 
people died. because of the atrocities and the

24:52.895 --> 25:00.544
killings of the Russians and the communist 
people. The AVO, they called them, is the

25:00.604 --> 25:13.060
Hungarian secret police who really went after 
these people and they killed them, you know, and

25:00.604 --> 25:13.060
tortured them and everything. And another 
150,000

25:18.595 --> 25:37.452
fled the country and they said afterwards that 
another 100,000 was deported and killed after,

25:18.595 --> 25:37.452
you know, they got after the people who were part, 
who took part in the revolution and they caught all

25:18.595 --> 25:37.452
of those people. So more than a quarter million 
people were either killed, displaced or sent to

25:41.022 --> 25:46.767
prison because of this revolution. We were 
fortunate enough to leave the country and come to

25:47.228 --> 25:53.253
the United States. We had trying times in Austria 
because everything was so disorganized.

25:58.377 --> 26:00.720
Austrian people did the best they could, you know. 
I remember we walked the streets for two, three

26:01.220 --> 26:07.105
days because the government was so disorganized. 
This thing happened so suddenly And with such a

26:10.148 --> 26:25.464
massive, you know,

26:10.148 --> 26:25.464
the people were just coming so fast all through 
Austria, you know, that they weren't ready for it.

26:25.484 --> 26:33.733
So the Austrian government was dependent on the 
people to take care of the immediate needs of the

26:25.484 --> 26:33.733
Hungarians. So we were we were called in from the 
streets, when we were walking down the streets,

26:35.495 --> 26:44.626
people opened their doors and said, come on in, 
we'll give you breakfast, or come on in, we'll give

26:35.495 --> 26:44.626
you lunch, you know. This was for a couple of days 
until the government did come and got more

26:45.126 --> 27:00.364
organized and put us on buses and we went to a place 
in the mountains where they had a big hotel and they

26:45.126 --> 27:00.364
put us up over there. What were some of the feelings 
toward the U.S.? I always, I don't know why, but I

27:04.081 --> 27:12.588
always had a sixth sense about, you know, that I'm 
going to go to the United States. When I was a little

27:12.648 --> 27:20.675
child, I always yearned to come, and I probably 
would have come even if my parents would have

27:12.648 --> 27:20.675
stayed over there. The people were very 
open-minded and looked very favorable upon, you

27:21.136 --> 27:27.962
know, the United States. And even though we were 
fed all this, you know, brainwashing about how the

27:34.456 --> 27:43.572
differences between colored people and white 
people, you know, were, it was all went, into smoke

27:44.041 --> 27:47.906
because, you know, this wasn't really what was 
happening. It was just, you know, when I first saw a

27:47.926 --> 28:06.332
first colored person in Austria, he was a doctor, 
and he's the one who examined me because everybody

27:47.926 --> 28:06.332
who, you know, came had to go through a thorough 
examination, and it was just wonderful. He was a

28:06.352 --> 28:08.395
doctor, and I, you know, We thought under 
Stalinism that there's a great depression of the

28:09.168 --> 28:20.043
colored people, and between the coloreds and the 
white, they had racial differences. In the United

28:20.063 --> 28:20.965
States? Yes, in the United States. And I didn't 
think that was true. There might be some

28:25.771 --> 28:33.943
differences, but not as deep as what they were 
saying.

28:37.366 --> 28:46.478
So what do you feel, what were some of the things 
that happened when you first got to the United

28:37.366 --> 28:46.478
States? Well, after Austria, we were still in 
Austria from the 3rd of November until

28:47.599 --> 29:03.660
January of 1957, which was January 7th or 8th. is 
when we finally got out of the... we were living in

29:03.944 --> 29:26.728
an Austrian hotel for about a month and a half and 
they were saying that somebody will come from the

29:03.944 --> 29:26.728
Hungarian consulate and will give us visas to the 
United States. At this time, the United States had

29:30.695 --> 29:55.534
opened up the quota to let a certain amount of 
Hungarian refugees in due to the revolution, and

29:30.695 --> 29:55.534
they let 20,000 people in Hungary, from Hungary to 
the United States, and we were trying to be one of

29:30.695 --> 29:55.534
the 20,000 and My family felt the need to leave the 
camp and go to Vienna on our own so we can surely make

29:56.189 --> 30:05.899
the quota because we were kind of close already. 
You know, everybody was filling in. We got some

30:10.094 --> 30:14.241
free train passes from the mountains. It was about 
90 miles or 100 miles from the mountains. We had bus

30:19.349 --> 30:25.379
passes, we had train passes, and so we got to 
Vienna. We were looking for the consulate. I spoke

30:27.482 --> 30:32.490
a little German, so we were able to manage our way, 
but somehow... The police caught us because we

30:32.909 --> 30:41.318
were wandering up and down the streets and we were 
kind of curious looking bunch. So they arrested us

30:42.519 --> 30:52.910
because they really didn't arrest us, but we 
didn't know where to sleep. So they took us in jail

30:52.970 --> 30:56.774
because that's why they had the most room. So when 
we went over there, but the people in the jail did

30:56.995 --> 31:02.140
not know that we weren't prisoners, you know, so 
they treated us like prisoners for about a day or

31:02.508 --> 31:07.680
so. We had to go to bed early and get up real early 
also, and then we were given just the prison food,

31:07.720 --> 31:17.302
and we had to go do the chores. We had to get up and 
wash the foot. And after that, I told them, we're

31:22.268 --> 31:23.652
not prisoners. We're here to go to the United 
States. We need to go to the consulate. And they let

31:28.084 --> 31:30.511
us go, you know. And I remember this was during the 
New Years of 1956.
