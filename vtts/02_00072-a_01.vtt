WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:27.902
Testing again, test number two on the 2nd of February.

00:28.543 --> 00:31.287
Testing, one, two, three.

00:36.093 --> 00:49.895
Dave, normally we begin by asking the interviewee to describe their background and experience before they came to Brazos County.

00:50.296 --> 00:54.102
Where did you grow up and go to school and so forth?

00:55.820 --> 01:04.652
As a small boy in the first through the third or fourth grade, I was brought up in central western Massachusetts.

01:07.937 --> 01:10.420
This was during the 30s, during the Depression.

01:10.881 --> 01:19.773
And West Brookfield was a small town with one major factory, which of course had gone belly up.

01:21.996 --> 01:25.641
My father and mother, my father was,

01:25.621 --> 01:27.745
was an engineer and a geologist.

01:28.286 --> 01:43.292
He had both a degree in engineering and a degree and a master's in geology, and the Quabbin Reservoir Project in western Massachusetts, which included building a 23-mile rock tunnel and two dams.

01:43.627 --> 01:47.293
kept him gainfully employed all through the Depression.

01:48.455 --> 01:49.437
So I was fortunate.

01:50.378 --> 01:54.525
Later, we moved to Providence, Rhode Island.

01:54.846 --> 02:01.117
Dad was employed by the Army Engineers, Connecticut River Flood Control.

02:02.619 --> 02:07.828
Perhaps you won't remember, but in the 34, there was major flooding on the Connecticut.

02:07.808 --> 02:20.907
And so we lived in Cranston, Rhode Island for a couple of years and then moved to Barrington, which is on Narragansett Bay on the east side en route from Providence to Newport.

02:21.511 --> 02:23.955
I really call that my hometown.

02:27.461 --> 02:29.183
I was in the high school class of 44.

02:29.404 --> 02:35.534
Of course, that was the last class to go off to World War II.

02:37.517 --> 02:40.461
I enlisted in the Navy that spring.

02:41.423 --> 02:44.548
Of course, they deferred going to boot camp until

02:44.528 --> 02:46.209
We graduated in June.

02:46.770 --> 02:55.738
So I went to boot camp at Sampson, New York around 1st of July in 1944.

02:56.138 --> 03:02.364
I turned 18 in July of that summer.

03:04.225 --> 03:13.033
After boot camp, Navy sent me to Purdue University to Navy Electrical School for four months.

03:13.013 --> 03:15.476
And then I shipped to the Southwest and Pacific.

03:17.558 --> 03:18.839
Amusingly, I think.

03:19.420 --> 03:27.989
I think I'm the only person that served in the US Navy in World War II who's never been and served in the Southwest Pacific has never been to the Hawaiian Islands.

03:29.831 --> 03:33.295
We shipped nonstop from San Francisco to Numia.

03:34.696 --> 03:37.379
And then we did a little cook's tour of the ship.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.843
Then I was on an army transport.

03:40.823 --> 03:44.227
I was Navy, but it was an Army transport, the Frederick Likes.

03:46.970 --> 03:53.698
From Numea, we went to Espirito Santos in the New Hebrides.

03:53.958 --> 03:55.940
No, Numea is in the New Hebrides.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.544
Espirito Santos is in, I've forgotten what islands.

03:59.925 --> 04:04.770
And then we went to Guadalcanal, trans-shipped some people there.

04:04.810 --> 04:09.075
These areas had long been secured.

04:09.342 --> 04:10.825
Hollandia, New Guinea.

04:10.845 --> 04:19.381
Hollandia, New Guinea, they dumped me off, along with my sea bag and some other people.

04:21.005 --> 04:26.355
The Navy had what they would call a receiving ship in Hollandia, and then they would assign me.

04:27.061 --> 04:32.771
And they turned around and then signed me to the destroyer repair base right there in Hollandia.

04:33.773 --> 04:40.204
So the last six months until the bomb was dropped, I spent in Hollandia.

04:41.826 --> 04:47.276
And at that point, we already had orders to move up to the Philippines.

04:47.396 --> 04:50.942
The Philippines were almost secure then.

04:50.922 --> 04:54.747
We were thinking about the invasion of Japan.

04:56.549 --> 05:05.561
And so most of the ships that I worked on were really landing craft that were eventually going to be assigned to make the landings.

05:06.862 --> 05:08.484
So then I shipped to the Philippines.

05:10.147 --> 05:14.973
I spent nine months on an island in Lady Gulf.

05:15.153 --> 05:16.795
It was a big ship repair base.

05:18.901 --> 05:27.070
I found out many years later that Fred Benson was stationed in Calicone, right across from that base.

05:32.276 --> 05:37.042
The nine months after the war ended, I finally got shipped home.

05:38.323 --> 05:44.250
I got home, I guess, probably in June of 46.

05:46.390 --> 05:56.630
I entered Brown that fall on GI Bill, graduated from Brown with a bachelor's in physics in 1950.

05:56.931 --> 06:07.993
I was mature enough to realize as much as I would have loved to have been a theoretical physicist, I didn't have it.

06:07.973 --> 06:18.068
I could do applied physics, but if you recall, right after the war, one of the areas of

06:19.212 --> 06:23.456
that many students were enamored with was atomic physics.

06:23.876 --> 06:26.198
And I decided I couldn't do it.

06:27.740 --> 06:31.783
I could not have gotten into graduates, a good graduate school in physics.

06:32.844 --> 06:39.410
And so I went to work for Owens-Corning fiberglass as a product development engineer.

06:40.511 --> 06:46.857
And again, in the post-war world, fiberglass had been a

06:46.837 --> 06:51.604
development of World War II and the civilian markets hadn't been developed.

06:54.148 --> 06:57.754
The first big market actually was in electrical sales.

06:58.455 --> 07:09.992
And so I worked with a small group of engineers in a laboratory in Ashton, Rhode Island.

07:09.972 --> 07:21.142
working with wire and cable companies, developing glass yarn for serving and braiding and knitting on wire and cable.

07:22.303 --> 07:27.407
And I spent three or four years at fiberglass.

07:28.428 --> 07:29.068
I enjoyed it.

07:29.269 --> 07:29.949
I did well.

07:31.711 --> 07:39.017
But at least at that time in fiberglass, the route up the ladder was through sales.

07:39.892 --> 07:47.303
I spent a lot of time out there with salespeople, showing where they could sell glass to customers.

07:48.204 --> 07:51.629
But none of the rewards came back to the people in the lab.

07:51.849 --> 07:53.652
And eventually, I left.

07:54.132 --> 07:57.938
I got to thinking about graduate school.

07:59.680 --> 08:05.629
When I was at Brown, I very carefully avoided geology, because my dad had been a geologist.

08:05.609 --> 08:09.394
But I obviously knew a lot of geology by osmosis.

08:09.955 --> 08:25.795
I had a degree in physics, and geophysics was a new sub-discipline of the Earth Sciences that was just beginning to make some inroads.

08:25.775 --> 08:31.661
And I applied to graduate school at MIT, was accepted.

08:35.005 --> 08:37.868
By this time, I had been married in 1952.

08:39.010 --> 08:45.857
My wife and I had one child when we were at MIT.

08:47.018 --> 08:51.343
I lived in student housing.

08:52.488 --> 08:56.854
It was referred to as Fertility Row, as you can imagine.

08:59.017 --> 09:06.386
And we had a pediatrician for our child had a funny name.

09:07.508 --> 09:11.033
Many years later, I happened to mention it in a crowd of people.

09:11.714 --> 09:15.639
I said, a pediatrician had this crazy name, T. Berry Brasselton.

09:16.780 --> 09:18.883
Have you ever heard of T. Berry Brasselton?

09:19.420 --> 09:23.277
He is the guru of all pediatricians today.

09:23.397 --> 09:29.464
He's retired now, but he is internationally famous.

09:29.950 --> 09:33.574
He replaced Dr. Spock as the guru.

09:34.314 --> 09:35.055
But anyway, so.

09:36.056 --> 09:37.297
Yeah.

09:38.459 --> 09:54.895
I had almost finished my coursework at MIT, and I had started to write a thesis proposal for a fellow named McDonald, Dr. McDonald.

09:54.875 --> 09:59.202
who was a young Harvard graduate and extremely brilliant.

10:01.125 --> 10:09.739
I don't know whether I ever could have successfully completed a dissertation under him.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.065
He was very bright, very demanding.

10:14.928 --> 10:19.515
But I was working on my proposal, and this is in the

10:21.993 --> 10:23.415
Well, I should back up a minute.

10:23.435 --> 10:25.138
I have to back up a minute.

10:25.158 --> 10:33.129
In 1957, the summer of 57, I was tired of taking coursework at MIT and doing the language requirements.

10:33.149 --> 10:40.239
And I got a job for the summer at Woods Hole Oceanographic.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.730
I participated in a seismic cruise, a geophysical cruise to the Caribbean.

10:47.710 --> 10:53.817
One of the professors was from Rice here in Texas.

10:54.678 --> 11:11.717
The other was John Ewing, brother of Maurice Ewing, who is perhaps certainly is known in the earth science community as one of the major contributors to our understanding of the world globe.

11:12.958 --> 11:16.502
So I went off to sea to the Caribbean.

11:16.482 --> 11:21.992
And that was the perfect match.

11:22.773 --> 11:26.219
Applied geophysics at sea.

11:26.941 --> 11:27.782
I loved the sea.

11:28.904 --> 11:32.571
And I presume part of that is because I was brought up on Narragansett Bay.

11:33.553 --> 11:37.600
And the Navy had seen to it that I did all my sea duty on land.

11:38.962 --> 11:41.106
And so, you know, I said, that's for me.

11:42.689 --> 11:46.717
I went back to MIT to finish up coursework.

11:47.458 --> 11:51.566
And that spring, I was working on my dissertation.

11:53.549 --> 12:06.233
And that was sort of interesting because in late spring, my proposed dissertation advisor suddenly announced that he was moving to UCLA.

12:07.917 --> 12:15.476
And he took one student with him, but he left several of us hanging.

12:17.101 --> 12:18.845
But serendipity.

12:19.848 --> 12:23.918
Within two weeks, I had a phone call from Woods Hole Oceanographic.

12:23.898 --> 12:33.552
They had agreed to participate in the International Geophysical Year.

12:35.214 --> 12:48.353
And in particular, they had committed themselves to send their Atlantis, their research vessel, at that time it was a two-masted, 160-foot yaw.

12:48.333 --> 13:08.904
And they had committed themselves to do some joint seismic work with Lamont Doherty, LDGO, which was a laboratory established by Maurice Ewing as part of Columbia University.

13:09.325 --> 13:15.454
The laboratory is about 20 miles up the Hudson from New York City in the Palisades.

13:15.434 --> 13:28.529
And the Lamont ship and that research vessel was an old three-masted schooner, the Vima, which had belonged to Betty Hutton at one time.

13:29.810 --> 13:43.045
But these were clearly in the infancy of oceanography, because the Atlantis was a two-masted sailing catch, 160 foot, and Vima was this black-hulled three-masted schooner.

13:44.527 --> 13:54.781
They had agreed to do seismic work, two-ship seismic refraction studies that studied the crustal structure beneath the seafloor in the Indian Ocean.

13:56.403 --> 14:12.205
I was supposed to join the Atlantis in Cape Town, but the Atlantis had engine problems, and they ended up sending the Atlantis through the Mediterranean.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.086
to Cairo.

14:13.106 --> 14:15.910
I joined the ship in Alexandria, Egypt.

14:18.414 --> 14:30.972
That was one of the nice things that happened to me in that I flew military air transport service because we were on, in those days, most of the work being done at sea was funded by the Navy.

14:31.913 --> 14:38.563
And the mass schedule was such that I had to go to Europe two weeks before the ship arrived in Alexandria.

14:39.792 --> 14:46.393
So I spent a week in Paris at $2 a night at the military hotel.

14:47.215 --> 14:49.181
And then went on to Rome, Cairo, whatever.

14:49.643 --> 14:51.388
But I joined the ship.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.074
Alexandria.

14:54.756 --> 15:10.255
We steamed down through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea, out into the Gulf of Aden, into the Indian Ocean, joined up with Atlantis, did some work in the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, and in the Red Sea.

15:10.235 --> 15:12.379
We won't get into that.

15:12.439 --> 15:18.569
There are some sea stories there that if I ever sit down, I really should write them.

15:18.970 --> 15:23.057
But coming back through the Mediterranean, we did some more work.

15:23.077 --> 15:30.049
And eventually, some of that seismic work in the Mediterranean became part of my dissertation.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.582
How did I get involved in that?

15:33.762 --> 15:47.443
Well, that spring, Woods Hole had made this commitment and they only had the head of the geophysics group at Woods Hole was a geophysicist.

15:47.503 --> 15:50.367
He was capable of doing the seismic work.

15:50.347 --> 15:57.900
The only other person was a woman who was very good, but in those days, they didn't allow women to go to sea on the ships.

15:58.842 --> 16:02.508
And so they called me up and said, did I want to do the seismology?

16:03.530 --> 16:06.735
And so it came just two weeks after

16:06.715 --> 16:12.366
I had bombed out as far as my dissertation proposal was concerned.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.470
And so I jumped at the turn.

16:14.510 --> 16:20.342
And I jumped at it, and I was responsible for doing the seismic work on the Atlantis.

16:20.643 --> 16:26.935
And I shared in the data, and some of it became part of my dissertation.

16:26.915 --> 16:40.648
With this intense interest in marine geophysical work, it was clear that, and I wanted to work on the data, so I sort of informally migrated to Woods Hole.

16:41.308 --> 16:50.397
I was still enrolled in MIT, but I was working as a project scientist at Woods Hole.

16:50.897 --> 16:55.842
And this is before there were any formal arrangements between the two institutions.

16:55.822 --> 17:01.167
Eventually, I completed my degree in 63.

17:01.548 --> 17:08.955
And so I started looking, casually looking for a job.

17:11.898 --> 17:17.103
The geophysics, there weren't many young people equipped to teach geophysics at the time.

17:18.585 --> 17:21.568
Woods Hole, of course, offered me a position to stay.

17:21.608 --> 17:25.812
And the other possibility was Lamont,

17:25.792 --> 17:48.441
the only other I never did investigate would have been Scripps and surprisingly A&M had an oceanography department and a geophysics department or a geophysics program at least and had a research vessel and so the department head in

17:50.868 --> 17:53.411
geology at that time was Shirley Lynch.

17:54.212 --> 17:56.095
I don't know whether you know him.

17:57.657 --> 18:01.902
He contacted me and we met in New York.

18:03.805 --> 18:11.475
And I did make a visit to A&M in the spring because the weather was fairly nice.

18:11.455 --> 18:14.439
I didn't ask the right questions.

18:15.160 --> 18:15.581
This is 1963.

18:15.601 --> 18:17.063
1963.

18:18.424 --> 18:22.210
Describe your impressions of A&M and this community.

18:22.490 --> 18:23.772
Wait till I get there.

18:23.792 --> 18:24.032
Oh, okay.

18:24.052 --> 18:24.332
Okay.

18:24.373 --> 18:26.215
Wait till I get there.

18:26.235 --> 18:26.535
Okay.

18:27.116 --> 18:29.920
I'm just saying right now I did not.

18:29.900 --> 18:35.068
asked all the right questions or I might not have come.

18:35.469 --> 18:38.433
There were two things that really made it interesting.

18:39.155 --> 18:44.964
One was A&M was offering me twice as much money as anybody else.

18:46.085 --> 18:47.388
And I can remember that.

18:47.408 --> 18:56.582
It was $14,000 starting salary for a young assistant professor who'd never been in a classroom, never been taught before.

18:56.562 --> 19:02.505
The other thing that made it attractive is that two of my colleagues,

19:03.464 --> 19:18.483
at Woods Hole, one who had been really sort of a mentor to me and who I considered to be, he was a genius who could never, people couldn't work with him, so he never produced very much.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.406
But he was great with me.

19:22.087 --> 19:26.713
I didn't have, he wasn't my major professor anymore, but he was a friend.

19:29.296 --> 19:31.699
They came to SCAS.

19:33.181 --> 19:37.311
SCAS, SCAS, Southwest Center for Advanced Studies.

19:38.254 --> 19:44.048
This was the institution that was, well, I'm sure you'll remember.

19:44.569 --> 19:45.672
Connolly was governor.

19:47.052 --> 19:59.347
There were two leaders in the Texas community that were trying hard to bring research-level science to Texas.

19:59.747 --> 20:08.017
Eric Johnson, who was mayor of Dallas, and Cecil Green, who was the founder of what is now TI.

20:09.178 --> 20:16.367
And they established this institution in Richardson that's now UT Dallas.

20:16.347 --> 20:18.013
Two of my colleagues went there.

20:19.819 --> 20:24.636
I found out, so that was attractive.

20:25.932 --> 20:35.163
Because the type of things I wanted to do involved more than just one person can't go out and do seismic experiments.

20:35.283 --> 20:37.005
It's going to take more than one person.

20:39.408 --> 20:41.631
So that was an aside.

20:41.671 --> 20:43.773
I didn't realize how that was going to play out.

20:44.014 --> 20:51.923
But I came partly because of this awareness, this awakening that was going on in the science community.

20:51.903 --> 20:58.871
And I would be, it would be fair to say that many of my friends said I was going to a dead end.

21:00.313 --> 21:01.114
Okay.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.757
So, okay, I accepted the job.

21:05.579 --> 21:12.848
I left my wife and two children in Woods Hole.

21:12.868 --> 21:14.430
We'd had two more children in the case.

21:14.450 --> 21:15.551
We had three children now.

21:16.152 --> 21:20.998
And my oldest son and I drove to Texas in our Studebaker Lock.

21:22.868 --> 21:27.114
And we arrived the last week in August.

21:28.776 --> 21:28.996
Okay.

21:29.257 --> 21:29.918
And it was warm.

21:30.458 --> 21:31.179
It was warm.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.723
And we started house hunting.

21:34.804 --> 21:40.552
And we were staying in a little rundown motel about halfway into Bryan.

21:41.273 --> 21:43.476
But it did have a window air conditioner.

21:43.496 --> 21:44.337
So we would...

21:44.317 --> 21:54.430
Here I am coming from Cape Cod, where it's a magnificent 70 degrees or whatever, and here it is hitting 98, 99 every day.

21:54.470 --> 22:09.430
And my son and I were looking for housing, and then we'd flee back to that motel room in the air conditioner in the afternoon.

22:13.814 --> 22:19.105
Before we talk about campus, let's just talk about the restaurant facilities at that time.

22:19.506 --> 22:25.359
If I recall, there were only, there were two cafeterias.

22:25.399 --> 22:27.263
There was one down at the bus station.

22:28.165 --> 22:28.806
I've forgotten.

22:28.886 --> 22:31.291
And there was another one somewhere.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.055
And then I think there was Coach Naughton's.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.093
Pancake House at East Gate.

22:37.295 --> 22:37.635
Yeah.

22:38.236 --> 22:40.440
No, no, wait a minute.

22:40.680 --> 22:41.682
He had a pancake house.

22:42.303 --> 22:45.929
Was that, well, it later became just a restaurant.

22:45.989 --> 22:46.289
Yes.

22:46.790 --> 22:47.371
Oh, okay.

22:47.772 --> 22:48.573
Right, right.

22:48.673 --> 22:52.900
So that was the variety.

22:55.732 --> 23:03.662
The campus geology, I was hired by the geology department.

23:03.682 --> 23:07.988
I actually replaced Peter Denier, who you may have known.

23:09.410 --> 23:13.095
Peter and I remained good friends for many years.

23:13.956 --> 23:25.030
And he had had one very fine student, a Turkish fellow, and the name doesn't come to me right now, who

23:25.010 --> 23:35.391
They had started a geophysics program, and Peter was doing some research in the Gulf testing marine gravimeters.

23:37.531 --> 23:41.776
I don't know how much of a teaching program he had started.

23:41.796 --> 23:59.054
The strange thing to me was that I suddenly arrived here and I found out that the department had permission to grant an undergraduate degree in geophysics, an MS, and a PhD.

24:01.737 --> 24:02.778
I arrived on the scene.

24:02.838 --> 24:04.720
I was the only geophysicist.

24:04.700 --> 24:10.448
with the exception of one grad student who did a little bit of the teaching.

24:11.209 --> 24:15.855
But if I recall, there were two graduate students and one undergraduate in geophysics.

24:17.077 --> 24:20.762
In geology, there was a reasonable number of students.

24:22.524 --> 24:31.737
In my view, the geology faculty were totally non-research-oriented.

24:33.927 --> 24:35.069
Turn it off for a moment.

24:37.732 --> 24:51.171
When I arrived on the scene in the department, I had been hired by, oh, my name slips my mind.

24:53.935 --> 24:54.636
We'll think of it later.

24:55.797 --> 24:56.338
We can add that.

24:56.358 --> 25:01.285
Well, by the time I got to Texas, he was no longer, he had retired.

25:02.075 --> 25:04.198
He had promised a lot of things.

25:04.840 --> 25:18.682
He had promised me, number one, that Monik Talwani, who later became director of LDGO and was also a director down at HAARC, had also been hired.

25:19.123 --> 25:22.328
So I knew that I had another person to talk with.

25:22.882 --> 25:24.463
That was a lot of hooey.

25:25.985 --> 25:32.070
He also promised me that I would have access to equipment and so forth and so on.

25:33.131 --> 25:33.972
And that was hooey.

25:35.033 --> 25:38.456
When I arrived on the scene, the acting department head was Trav Parker.

25:39.838 --> 25:50.087
The other faculty members at the time were Clay Seward, Fred Smith,

25:52.801 --> 25:53.469
Mel Schroeder.

25:53.935 --> 25:55.656
Mel Schroeder, yeah.

25:56.412 --> 25:58.215
And that's about it, I think.

26:00.157 --> 26:03.282
None of these individuals were doing any research.

26:04.844 --> 26:07.408
They were doing classical geology.

26:07.468 --> 26:11.654
And I know Fred Smith was a pretty darn good field geologist.

26:13.997 --> 26:23.871
But none of them had any feeling for what was going on outside of just classical geology.

26:23.851 --> 26:31.043
And here we were in a hotbed of oil petroleum exploration.

26:32.660 --> 26:36.345
really a mecca for geophysics people as well as geologists.

26:37.306 --> 26:59.055
And what I couldn't understand is that these people had lots of contacts in the oil industry, but some of it never rubbed off in trying to understand what was going on in terms of what we were finding out at sea, what led to this revolution, seafloor spreading, plate tectonic revolution.

26:59.035 --> 27:05.066
Now the department head that first year of geology was whom?

27:05.607 --> 27:06.228
Trav Parker.

27:06.288 --> 27:06.809
Trav Parker.

27:06.829 --> 27:08.331
Trav Parker, he was acting head.

27:09.113 --> 27:10.756
So you reported to him?

27:10.776 --> 27:11.697
I reported to him.

27:11.898 --> 27:16.486
Now what's interesting is the geology department was in engineering.

27:17.387 --> 27:18.850
Fred Benson was the dean.

27:19.994 --> 27:28.327
The first summer I was at Woods Hole, I mean at, in the department, I went back to Woods Hole and did more work in the Mediterranean.

27:29.128 --> 27:39.203
The next summer, my first summer in Texas, I would wear, I was wearing Bermuda shorts, very nice Bermuda shorts.

27:39.223 --> 27:41.868
The building was non-air conditioned.

27:41.888 --> 27:42.829
It was dripping.

27:44.007 --> 27:57.759
And the word came down for me that Fred Benson had seen this young professor walking around, not so young either, walking around in Bermuda shorts, and that I was to understand that I was to dress formally.

27:59.661 --> 28:00.141
OK?

28:01.282 --> 28:04.325
That shook me up.

28:05.746 --> 28:13.153
The other thing that shook me up, when I had first arrived at A&M, the building was not air conditioned.

28:13.673 --> 28:17.897
And yet all these professors had air conditioners in their window.

28:17.917 --> 28:21.161
Then they tell me that they were all personally owned.

28:21.421 --> 28:24.985
The university did not provide you with an air conditioner.

28:26.326 --> 28:31.872
Well, they found one for me somewhere on a research grant or somewhere.

28:32.253 --> 28:35.756
But you couldn't live in those offices without an air conditioner.

28:36.177 --> 28:40.221
Where was the department located and describe the

28:40.690 --> 28:44.274
physical facilities for the department?

28:44.294 --> 28:52.323
The department was in what is now the old wing of the Halbooty Building.

28:53.745 --> 29:00.252
It had that magnificent tower structure on the front, which later came off.

29:03.756 --> 29:05.538
My office was on the second floor.

29:06.198 --> 29:10.343
I had a suite of offices because there were so few staff members.

29:10.323 --> 29:30.987
And it was shared with a grad student who was a good friend of mine, Bill Jones, Billy Bob Jones, who I once introduced as William Jones, and he corrected me because I was still, had not adapted to Texas-style names.

29:32.008 --> 29:34.491
So anyway, Bill

29:36.496 --> 29:43.023
shared the office suite with me and we've been friends for many years.

29:44.625 --> 29:53.934
I also had a great big walk-in safe up there and I perhaps shouldn't say this but I kept explosive cartridges in there.

29:54.114 --> 29:59.800
I mean I did some seismic work around here and I had these little squib charges and I kept those in there.

30:00.501 --> 30:06.047
What were your teaching and research responsibilities that assignments that first year?

30:08.035 --> 30:14.974
I arrived on the scene and here we have a graduate undergraduate program and I'm supposed to teach all the courses and

30:16.388 --> 30:18.951
Buddy Atwood was a grad student.

30:18.971 --> 30:23.917
He helped teach the undergraduate geophysics.

30:23.957 --> 30:35.951
But at that time, if I recall, the geologists were required to take two courses in geophysics, one in applied and one in sort of global geophysics.

30:36.492 --> 30:40.557
So there were two courses that had to be taught.

30:42.494 --> 30:46.582
There were only two grad students, but two or three grad students.

30:47.864 --> 30:51.932
And, you know, there were several courses on the books.

30:51.952 --> 30:53.154
I have to go back now.

30:53.214 --> 30:59.566
But I know in those first few years, I was teaching theoretical seismology.

30:59.847 --> 31:00.709
I was teaching.

31:02.211 --> 31:03.574
I taught all the courses.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.308
I don't know how, I didn't have much time.

31:09.698 --> 31:11.443
What about the laboratory capabilities?

31:11.503 --> 31:13.750
Laboratory facilities were almost.
