00:03.170 --> 00:10.259
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.063
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

00:16.567 --> 00:27.540
This is February the 20th, and we're in the former student, no, the foundation, NM Foundation building.

00:27.925 --> 00:35.197
and I have the joy and pleasure and honor of chatting with James Randall Mattson, once of Pampa, Texas.

00:35.939 --> 00:42.630
Randy, to begin with, introduce yourself to anybody that might hear this tape or read the transcription.

00:43.672 --> 00:53.308
Describe growing up in Pampa, your parents, when did you all move there, what did your dad do, others in the family, and so forth.

00:55.803 --> 00:58.788
Well, I go by Randy Mattson, and always have.

01:00.732 --> 01:02.716
Probably be known better by that.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.442
I was born in Kilgore, Texas in 1945.

01:06.703 --> 01:11.832
My dad worked in the oil fields, grew up working in the oil fields.

01:12.053 --> 01:15.499
Everybody in my, his family worked in the oil fields.

01:15.479 --> 01:34.382
Six months after I was born, he was transferred to Borger, Texas, which in those days, the Texas Panhandle was kind of the latest hot oil patch in Texas, I guess, and there was a lot going on in those days.

01:35.343 --> 01:44.254
Lived there until I started the first grade, and then at that point he was transferred to Pampa, which is about

01:45.398 --> 01:49.084
35 miles probably from Borger, but a lot more than that.

01:49.165 --> 01:54.414
Culturally, it's about like the difference between Austin and College Station.

01:54.754 --> 02:00.344
A lot of difference between a Pampa Harvester and a Borger Bulldog.

02:01.106 --> 02:05.854
If I'd stayed in Borger, I'd never picked up a shot put probably.

02:06.273 --> 02:08.896
I went to public schools all through Pampa.

02:10.357 --> 02:15.422
My dad worked for the same oil company, oil servicing company, Dowell, through those years.

02:18.205 --> 02:25.031
Started my organized sports at the age of nine when they started Little League Baseball in Pampa, Texas.

02:25.792 --> 02:30.637
It was the first institution that was integrated in Pampa in those days.

02:30.937 --> 02:35.301
That was the back before

02:35.821 --> 02:45.195
and most of the schools in Texas had separate schools, separate facilities, and Little League Baseball was the first time that that had ever happened.

02:45.796 --> 02:48.320
And we got out and built the ballparks ourselves.

02:48.420 --> 02:53.508
One of the stipulations of playing is you had to work on the ballparks themselves.

02:53.588 --> 02:59.236
So that was my first organized athletics in those days.

02:59.296 --> 03:02.301
Went through the elementary school there.

03:03.513 --> 03:05.776
I participated in most sports.

03:06.698 --> 03:09.562
When I got to high school, I had to decide somewhat.

03:09.882 --> 03:15.510
Pampa had been a longtime basketball power and pretty down in football.

03:15.931 --> 03:20.678
There was a lot of pressure for me to participate in basketball.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.957
and also a lot of pressure for me to participate in football.

03:25.039 --> 03:35.556
I was also by that time fairly active in track and field and had kind of settled on throwing the shot put and discus in the weight events.

03:35.736 --> 03:41.586
By the time I got to high school I was 6'6 and weighed about 210-15 pounds.

03:41.566 --> 03:43.729
Now that's in the ninth or tenth grade?

03:43.809 --> 03:45.752
That would have been the tenth grade.

03:46.113 --> 03:48.917
I was 6'3 and 185 in the ninth grade.

03:48.957 --> 03:56.308
Then I was 6'6 and a half after the summer and had a fear of being seven foot tall.

03:56.388 --> 04:02.477
If I'd have been, I couldn't see at that time that there would have been a benefit to be seven foot tall.

04:02.517 --> 04:09.447
I might have made some money playing basketball because later on in my basketball career at A&M, I found out that 6'6 wasn't quite big enough.

04:10.253 --> 04:24.600
But I thoroughly enjoyed my career at Pampa and felt very fortunate to be from a West Texas town with one high school where everybody expected a great deal of you but supported you.

04:25.323 --> 04:31.437
I remember the feeling of not wanting to go downtown when we were beating football or basketball on Saturday morning.

04:31.457 --> 04:32.800
We kind of hid out.

04:32.820 --> 04:35.046
Now in football you played what?

04:35.066 --> 04:38.694
In football, I played my sophomore and senior year.

04:38.734 --> 04:41.661
I was injured a lot in my sophomore year.

04:43.109 --> 04:50.258
I had a couple broken, a foot that was broken two or three times, kept re-breaking it.

04:50.919 --> 04:56.005
And then elected because of track and basketball not to play my junior year.

04:57.727 --> 05:00.150
And then I came back my senior year.

05:00.210 --> 05:05.016
My senior year I played fullback and defensive end.

05:06.059 --> 05:08.204
and also played basketball on track and field.

05:08.545 --> 05:10.269
And basketball, y'all were good.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.674
In basketball, my senior year, we were 30-2.

05:12.915 --> 05:24.000
We were defeated in my district, upset, and felt like we were one of the teams favored to play for the state championship that year, which Pampa had done more than the 4A school at that time.

05:24.537 --> 05:34.148
And that was one of my big disappointments in my athletic career is losing that game against, at that time it was called Birdville, Haltom City, Fort Worth.

05:35.730 --> 05:36.510
And were you the center?

05:37.071 --> 05:37.712
I was the center.

05:38.693 --> 05:44.479
And we had at least four or five players off that team go to college on basketball scholarships.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.221
We had a good basketball team.

05:46.882 --> 05:49.465
Football, we were very mediocre and won three or four games.

05:49.445 --> 05:55.593
Was that basketball coach, was he important in any of your development?

05:55.613 --> 05:56.874
Well, he was.

05:56.914 --> 06:05.666
He took over my sophomore year from a long-time, very successful coach, Clifton McNeely.

06:05.726 --> 06:07.268
Oh, he took, oh, this wasn't McNeely.

06:07.288 --> 06:08.749
He was assistant, and he took over.

06:09.390 --> 06:14.777
And he...

06:15.854 --> 06:20.143
So I didn't have the opportunity to really work much under Coach McNeely.

06:22.148 --> 06:31.348
My basketball coach name was Terry Cully and coached there all through years and later on moved on.

06:33.303 --> 06:34.324
at the end of that year.

06:34.345 --> 06:38.631
Well, in football we were not very successful.

06:38.831 --> 06:52.751
I made all district defensive end and then in basketball we had a good team and I was fortunate to make first team All-State so I was recruited somewhat in both of them.

06:54.434 --> 06:57.659
Surprisingly in football except I was fairly good big then.

06:57.699 --> 07:00.643
I wasn't very heavy and I was the

07:01.990 --> 07:06.756
one of the fastest runners on the team, I guess, for my size.

07:06.836 --> 07:14.086
But then in track and field, my junior year in high school I won the state championship.

07:14.286 --> 07:16.329
When did you start throwing the shot?

07:16.509 --> 07:22.177
I started throwing the shot in, actually the first time was in the sixth grade.

07:23.418 --> 07:26.763
We had a sixth grade track meet and we signed up for different events.

07:26.883 --> 07:30.748
And I won the 50 and the 100 and the high jump.

07:31.555 --> 07:34.662
in the long jump, and I finished sixth in the shot put.

07:34.762 --> 07:37.108
So being real smart, I picked the shot put.

07:37.188 --> 07:38.551
That's the way it works.

07:38.631 --> 07:44.805
But you didn't have to do all that running when you were a shot putter, except you had to work out pretty hard.

07:45.730 --> 07:56.045
By the time I got to junior high, I had started moving more toward... Is there anybody who deserves credit for encouraging you to concentrate on track, on the shot?

07:56.205 --> 08:01.252
Well, I had a number of coaches that encouraged me all along.

08:01.713 --> 08:05.058
You know, I guess everyone I ever had, I benefited from in some way.

08:05.118 --> 08:11.687
But I had one particular coach, Dwayne Lyons, who was the head track coach and line coach in football.

08:12.983 --> 08:20.894
And he was the old ex-Marine, tough, rough coach that demanded a lot out of you.

08:20.914 --> 08:24.358
As a matter of fact, he's the only coach I've ever really had that I was afraid of, you know.

08:24.659 --> 08:28.944
But he expected a lot out of me.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.810
I can remember my junior year, he was my coach.

08:33.070 --> 08:35.413
He had to leave out between my junior and senior year.

08:36.187 --> 08:44.199
My junior year, I was leading the state in the discus and we went to the West Texas Relays in Odessa, Texas.

08:45.261 --> 08:52.111
It was a big event and they made a big deal in the paper about me being the state leader there in the discus at that time.

08:52.131 --> 09:00.844
And I fouled on my first three throws and didn't even make the qualifying and I remember

09:02.005 --> 09:31.422
feeling bad and standing there and somebody came up to me and said you may want another copy of this out of the paper about you being here and hand it to me and he walked up and said what is that and looked at it and tore it up and threw it down and walked off and and we didn't talk for another couple of weeks but I didn't get beat again in the discus the rest of the year and but anyway I went on from there and I was very fortunate to win the state championship and the shot in discus probably early in the year would not have been one that would have been favored to do that

09:31.773 --> 09:33.236
and also set a state record.

09:33.858 --> 09:39.229
And so that kind of set the stage for me having to decide what I was going to do at some point.

09:39.911 --> 09:48.870
My senior year I came back and broke both of those records in the shot and discus and also was recruited

09:48.850 --> 09:51.653
quite a bit in basketball and some in football.

09:52.213 --> 10:01.582
You told me once upon a time about, I think it was after the state meet of your junior year, you're back home by yourself.

10:01.983 --> 10:02.263
Right.

10:02.463 --> 10:07.748
I came back and my coach had been told that he was not going to be rehired.

10:07.768 --> 10:11.692
They were making a football change and he'd asked to stay on just to coach me.

10:12.973 --> 10:14.875
And they declined on that.

10:14.855 --> 10:28.050
What's interesting, he went on to California, took over a head job at a new high school that never played football, and in three years won the state championship in California, but that's another story, I guess.

10:29.471 --> 10:41.965
But one day, before school's out, we're out there, and I asked him if I could throw a 16-pound shot, which was a college shot, just to see how far I could throw it.

10:42.766 --> 10:44.288
And he had one up in the attic.

10:44.892 --> 10:58.565
crawled up there, got it down, handed it to me, Rusty, and we went out there and he watched me and worked with me and I threw 55 feet, which the Southwest Conference record at that time was 57, held by an Aggie.

11:00.047 --> 11:07.794
And so we were sitting down there talking and he looked at me and said, someday if you want to, you can go to the Olympics.

11:08.955 --> 11:09.956
If you want to, bad enough.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.600
And that's the first time I'd ever thought about Olympic games, anything like that.

11:14.153 --> 11:19.962
But I don't guess I ever went out to practice or do anything with it again that I didn't think about it.

11:19.982 --> 11:37.570
And I'm sure he wasn't thinking about planting a seed like that at the time, but then it was fun over the years when I'd go to California, he'd get to watch me compete and was usually pretty critical of what I would do even though I was the best in the country at that time.

11:37.590 --> 11:42.017
But anyway, that was kind of a defining moment, I guess,

11:42.487 --> 11:47.114
I think from that moment on, I really knew that I was going to be a shot putter and discus thrower.

11:47.175 --> 11:49.799
It wasn't the glamour that the other sports had.

11:49.819 --> 12:04.883
There was nothing you could do with it after your years of competing, but I really enjoyed the training by myself and the working by myself.

12:05.268 --> 12:09.695
I was recruited by over 100 schools to go.

12:09.795 --> 12:22.073
Before we talk about that recruitment, as you look back now, what kind of values, attitudes did you get out of family and out of teachers and coaches?

12:22.954 --> 12:27.301
Well, I think it was kind of a lot simpler time in those days.

12:27.361 --> 12:32.068
My mother and dad were very supportive of my competing

12:33.263 --> 12:36.187
They really didn't understand my interest in it as much.

12:36.667 --> 12:42.835
They were not involved in formal sports that much, but they gave me the opportunity to do it.

12:42.935 --> 12:47.701
They never questioned, you know, the time that I was putting in and coming home late and doing that.

12:47.721 --> 13:01.498
And they would go and watch me, but I didn't get a lot of criticism or, you know, my dad's attitude, it's your choice to do it, and if you don't like the coach, well, then you don't have to do it kind of thing.

13:03.082 --> 13:07.118
But I remember coming home and

13:08.144 --> 13:13.793
getting in late from out of town basketball game they may have listened to on the radio and saying, I sure didn't do very well.

13:13.854 --> 13:15.276
My dad would say, you sure did.

13:15.957 --> 13:19.423
And mother gripping him for being negative.

13:19.443 --> 13:22.127
But that was just the way it was.

13:22.809 --> 13:29.720
But they encouraged me in a way I think that was positive because they came out to watch.

13:31.163 --> 13:34.388
I used to think my dad sure likes...

13:35.195 --> 13:38.235
sports until I quit competing.

13:38.255 --> 13:39.906
He never went back.

13:40.645 --> 13:49.896
Now, you worked out then every day, year round almost, didn't you, in some sport?

13:49.916 --> 13:56.665
After, yeah, it was all year round, even in summers, and after probably my sophomore year in high school.

13:56.685 --> 13:58.147
It was pretty scary.

13:58.167 --> 14:02.192
In terms of what you were eating and drinking, what was your routine?

14:02.312 --> 14:06.097
No, that was before, even before weightlifting then, really.

14:06.117 --> 14:09.741
My high school coach that I mentioned,

14:09.721 --> 14:15.919
Coach Lyons, he made my first barbell that I got to use out of 75 pounds.

14:17.223 --> 14:24.304
He got two buckets and put concrete in them and a bar in it and it weighed 75 pounds and we did a few exercises with that.

14:25.043 --> 14:30.211
But there was a concern about being muscle-bound and being non-athletic.

14:30.932 --> 14:32.274
And, boy, has that changed today.

14:33.917 --> 14:40.627
But I didn't have much time to do that anyway because there's not an off-season to lift weights and train.

14:40.887 --> 14:42.129
I just go from one to the other.

14:42.570 --> 14:46.596
And I think that was a...

14:47.048 --> 14:51.879
advantage in some ways too, to get to do all the different sports and develop some different skills.

14:51.939 --> 14:56.970
Was there anything that you tried to eat or not eat?

14:57.531 --> 14:59.656
Oh, not really.

14:59.676 --> 15:05.749
I was frustrated because I couldn't get bigger and gain weight.

15:06.590 --> 15:18.907
And I was naturally kind of a lanky build and it was frustrating to me because when people would see me they wouldn't think I was a shot putter, you know, and I looked more like a basketball player.

15:20.370 --> 15:27.079
But in the long run I think that was an advantage too because I had the longer muscles and leaner muscles.

15:27.413 --> 15:33.948
When I came to A&M, then I really got serious about getting bigger and had some people that knew what to do, but I didn't know.

15:34.249 --> 15:39.060
Now in high school, what did you and your buddies do for a good time?

15:41.690 --> 15:43.612
Like you say, I went from one sport to the other.

15:43.693 --> 15:49.220
I don't ever remember eating supper with my family because it was always on the stove when I got home.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.282
But on Saturday night, y'all must have done that.

15:51.302 --> 15:53.125
Well, we'd go to the drive-in theater, you know.

15:53.625 --> 15:54.927
That was about it in Pampa.

15:54.947 --> 15:55.628
Wasn't a lot to do.

15:55.768 --> 15:56.449
I wasn't a hunter.

15:56.469 --> 15:58.832
A lot of them liked to go out and shoot rabbits and stuff.

15:58.892 --> 16:03.217
I never didn't care about that.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.200
Was beer leaving legal in Pampa?

16:05.348 --> 16:12.860
Yeah, did, you know, that was such a, there was some of that.

16:14.242 --> 16:24.197
I didn't participate in that in high school, but there was a, there was some of that, but boy, the penalty was great if you got caught.

16:24.898 --> 16:26.882
You're kicked off the team, you know, any athlete.

16:26.902 --> 16:27.863
Matter of fact,

16:28.096 --> 16:34.104
The coaches used to go through the cafeteria and we couldn't drink Cokes or eat the dessert in the cafeteria.

16:34.144 --> 16:35.786
So you had to sneak around and drink Cokes.

16:36.126 --> 16:37.608
That would make you short-winded.

16:37.768 --> 16:42.975
It was a big shock when I came to A&M at halftime, a basketball game, they brought Cokes in.

16:43.035 --> 16:43.635
I couldn't believe it.

16:43.655 --> 16:45.598
The coach would give you a Coke.

16:46.419 --> 16:51.285
That was just one of those things that... Did your parents have any conduct rules for you?

16:54.337 --> 16:57.401
They had some strong expectations.

16:58.123 --> 17:00.626
I don't know that we ever sat down and really talked about rules.

17:01.547 --> 17:07.897
My curfew was around 11 to 12.

17:09.018 --> 17:13.925
I say that around because if I wasn't home by 11, they better have heard from me.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.310
And I could call at 11 and say, well, you know, we're not doing it.

17:17.330 --> 17:18.672
We're just, I'm going to work somewhere.

17:18.732 --> 17:19.994
We've run a little late, 11.30.

17:20.054 --> 17:20.876
They just wanted to know.

17:21.236 --> 17:22.538
And that kind of...

17:23.429 --> 17:32.241
I always felt like that they wanted to know where I was at and what I was doing and as long as that was

17:33.217 --> 17:57.807
there wasn't a lot of concerns and but in those days you kind of stayed with the same friends almost all the way through and the parents knew each other and you were at one of them's house or just hanging out because very few had cars and the chance to go do things in so it was it was a lot different and you're you and your family were church goers my no not really when i was young we my

17:58.259 --> 17:59.904
My parents didn't go much.

18:00.025 --> 18:02.874
They were raised to, then they didn't too much.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.666
And so early on we didn't

18:06.933 --> 18:07.834
I didn't do a lot of that.

18:07.874 --> 18:13.099
I really started doing that more after I got to A&M.

18:13.119 --> 18:13.399
Oh, okay.

18:13.840 --> 18:14.300
Recruiting.

18:14.400 --> 18:19.285
When did somebody first start talking to you about where to go to college?

18:19.305 --> 18:23.689
Well, when I was a junior in high school, the recruiting rules were a lot different then.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.151
They could make unlimited contacts.

18:25.171 --> 18:25.852
They could call you.

18:25.872 --> 18:26.632
They could come by.

18:27.653 --> 18:34.560
And the first two that I really remember were OU, because it was close.

18:35.063 --> 18:39.609
We're closer to OU than we are to College Station, a lot closer.

18:39.629 --> 18:46.479
And they actually took me up there, flew me up there on a private plane my junior year to watch a football game.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.825
They were recruiting me in football a little bit, basketball, and track.

18:50.925 --> 18:53.689
And the other was University of Southern California.

18:54.210 --> 18:55.832
And they had a great history.

18:55.852 --> 19:01.500
They had Dallas Sloan, who had been a world record holder, Perry O'Brien, Rink Babkin, the Discus.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.024
And they had a coach by the name of Vern Wolf who was

19:04.426 --> 19:10.816
Dallas Long's coach in high school in Phoenix and then also the coach at Southern Cal.

19:11.837 --> 19:22.553
And he came out to see me my junior year and really recruited me probably on a regular basis harder than anyone to come to University of Southern California.

19:23.512 --> 19:26.498
Now, all right, that was in your junior year.

19:26.518 --> 19:29.323
All right, then when did it, when did the volume?

19:29.343 --> 19:39.343
Well, my senior year, it really picked up, and especially after my junior year when I broke the state, because I think I led the nation, even my junior year in shot and discus.

19:40.488 --> 19:48.047
And that was before there was a real limitation on track scholarships and stuff, so a lot of schools gave more scholarships than they do today.

19:48.428 --> 19:50.253
And that was before women's athletics.

19:51.396 --> 19:57.872
And then I had coaches coming by and calling, and you know, it got to where my

19:58.595 --> 20:00.479
parents just wanted to hide out, you know.

20:00.859 --> 20:03.745
They didn't answer the phone and they let me talk to them.

20:04.647 --> 20:08.574
After that, I narrowed it down fairly early though to A&M Texas.

20:10.478 --> 20:18.954
And the main reason for that, Texas Tech a little bit because they were close and they had a good basketball program then, but didn't have much of a track program.

20:20.117 --> 20:21.379
Abilene Christian,

20:22.777 --> 20:29.447
A&M, Texas, and Rice had the best track in those days, and they were nationally competitive.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.414
And probably the best track program was Abilene Christian.

20:34.554 --> 20:39.621
It was a smaller school, and I did visit with them a little bit.

20:41.263 --> 20:49.375
But I narrowed it down, and a part of that was influenced by what would be legal today, but there was an Aggie in Pampa that was a lawyer,

20:50.013 --> 20:59.215
And there was a University of Texas lawyer and they just tried to sell me on going to A&M in Texas like you would think they would do.

20:59.235 --> 21:07.414
And they had campaigns for, you know, I'm getting calls from Longhorns all over the state and the letters and the Aggies.

21:08.221 --> 21:17.136
Coach Thomas, track coach at A&M, he must have sent something out to A&M clubs, because I got all these letters from all over the state of Texas.

21:17.997 --> 21:28.354
And most of them from A&M were positive, and I kept a lot of those letters over the years and looked back and had an opportunity to get to know some of those people when I went to work here.

21:28.895 --> 21:33.182
But most of the A&M letters were positive in that they,

21:33.635 --> 21:41.965
You know, they were from the president of a bank and all their letterheads and stuff, and I was very impressed how successful these guys had been.

21:42.766 --> 21:52.017
But their experience at A&M, and it's positive, where most of the University of Texas letters were saying, if you go to A&M, we'll never hear from you again, and that's the, you know, it's the sorryest place in the world.

21:52.057 --> 22:03.591
And I had a little trouble figuring that out, but I didn't have any background with either one, so I decided to visit both of them.

22:04.010 --> 22:12.002
and did that and I visited at Oklahoma and really didn't go look at hardly any other schools, Texas Tech.

22:12.582 --> 22:26.743
I stopped at Baylor on the way to the state track meeting one time and they got turned in for illegally working me out because I practiced out there, which was kind of a joke back then, but somebody had said they had tried me out at Baylor.

22:26.843 --> 22:29.687
Baylor had a coach that was a very good coach, Jack Patterson.

22:30.428 --> 22:32.852
At that time, he switched to the University of Texas

22:33.676 --> 22:40.505
and he was put in a moral dilemma because he'd been recruiting me for Baylor.

22:41.912 --> 22:43.197
I really thought a lot of him.

22:43.953 --> 22:55.294
and he really couldn't recruit me from University of Texas and so they left it to Darrell Royal and people like that called me but I was interested in who the coach was.

22:56.536 --> 23:05.252
And so even when I visited over there it was a awkward situation for him

23:05.772 --> 23:16.545
And they had a football coach pick me up and, you know, did some, and really hit me hard about playing basketball, and I could do both.

23:16.685 --> 23:20.049
And so I ruled Texas out pretty early.

23:20.070 --> 23:22.152
They took me to a fraternity.

23:23.674 --> 23:28.460
A lot of the athletes were in fraternities, and they had a party out at the lake.

23:28.500 --> 23:35.188
And, you know, when I came to A&M, they took me to an A&M Texas baseball game, and I got to watch that and had Aggies.

23:35.843 --> 23:38.429
the rivalry between A&M and Texas, so.

23:40.214 --> 23:42.600
And didn't you fly once to LA?

23:43.201 --> 23:51.663
Oh, that's right, I did, I did fly, and Southern Cal was where I was going to school, through my junior year and early in my senior year.

23:52.244 --> 23:53.447
And I flew out there,

23:53.782 --> 23:57.267
And just based on track that's where I would have gone.

23:58.408 --> 24:01.292
And I flew out there though and it was quite a cultural shock.

24:01.332 --> 24:02.974
Didn't you meet some celebrities?

24:03.275 --> 24:07.460
Well they, you know, it was the first time I'd flown on a jet plane, you know, they flew me out there.

24:07.480 --> 24:12.827
They had an alumnus fly with me from Texas that was, which was all legal in those days.

24:13.108 --> 24:15.250
He met me in Amarillo and we flew out there.

24:15.951 --> 24:18.375
I stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

24:19.556 --> 24:23.181
Remember I brought the key back, kept that key for years.

24:23.161 --> 24:45.979
took me to Disneyland and I finally asked when did I get to see and I got to the celebrities I got to meet were Dallas Long and Perry O'Brien and Rink Babka who were legends already then and and they told me if I come to Southern Cal I'll be just like them you know and that was pretty pretty strong stuff and but

24:45.959 --> 24:53.149
It was quite a cultural shock for a kid from Tampa, Texas to go to Los Angeles in those days and University of Southern California.

24:54.711 --> 24:58.417
And I said, where do you live and wherever you want to live?

24:58.837 --> 25:01.141
You know, it was a different day.

25:01.241 --> 25:03.965
They didn't have an athletic dorm or anything like that in those days.

25:04.025 --> 25:06.949
So I ruled that out pretty early on.

25:08.231 --> 25:10.654
And so it really came down to A&M in Texas pretty quick.

25:10.774 --> 25:14.920
Describe that special Saturday that you came up to College Station.

25:14.900 --> 25:20.235
Well, the Aggie that, come on.

25:21.903 --> 25:25.527
A good friend over all these years was the attorney that had gone to A&M.

25:25.547 --> 25:26.549
He'd been on the golf team.

25:27.250 --> 25:31.274
His name's Malcolm Douglas, and he's class of 53 at A&M.

25:32.296 --> 25:34.719
And he was a very low-key guy.

25:34.759 --> 25:36.201
He never put any pressure on me.

25:36.281 --> 25:40.626
He really wanted what was best for me, and if A&M was best, then that was going to be a good thing.

25:40.646 --> 25:43.730
If it wasn't, I could have gone somewhere else, and he wouldn't have said a word.

25:43.830 --> 25:50.458
But he flew down with me, and we brought my best friend, who wanted to go to A&M too,

25:50.438 --> 25:52.261
or thought was thinking about going.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.407
And the name of Don Ayres.

25:56.549 --> 25:58.372
That's A-Y-R-E-S.

25:59.795 --> 26:07.789
And so we flew down to Houston and we were picked up, which is legal in those days, by two Aggies.

26:08.309 --> 26:10.412
about as great as Aggies can get.

26:10.893 --> 26:22.953
John Lindsey, class of 44 who was on the Board of Regents and the President of the Association of Former Students and about anything else that had at A&M.

26:24.155 --> 26:25.457
Billman's named after him and

26:25.741 --> 26:42.926
And the other one was a fellow named Jack Knox, who was a medical doctor, who was one of the Aggies in Houston, class of 46, and later became president of the Association.

26:43.747 --> 26:49.135
But they picked me up at the airport in a big white Cadillac.

26:49.315 --> 26:51.158
I've never been in a Cadillac.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.436
and they're going to drive me the scenic route to College Station.

26:54.476 --> 27:03.435
In those days, you could come through Hempstead and Avisota, but they were going to take me down to Conroe and cut across, even though they normally didn't go that way.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.582
Well, it's dark, and they're trying all the way there selling me.

27:06.933 --> 27:09.416
And they can't find the turnoff.

27:10.257 --> 27:12.781
And so I said, you know, this is kind of bad.

27:12.801 --> 27:17.247
These guys are such big Aggies, they can't find the place.

27:17.267 --> 27:18.929
You know, if they can't find it.

27:19.350 --> 27:21.232
And then they had a flat and had help fix the flat.

27:22.113 --> 27:27.220
And by the time we got there, I was getting to wonder if there was such a place or if we'd ever find it.

27:28.229 --> 27:41.614
and uh but it was a turned out to be a great experience and and both of those even though Dr. Knox is deceased now became very considerable great friends and were good to me long after I'd

27:42.134 --> 27:42.975
finished at A&M.

27:43.055 --> 27:46.719
And that was one of the things that they tried to sell you on at A&M in those days.

27:48.140 --> 27:53.886
And it turned out to be true that the relationships that you make stay with you.

27:54.787 --> 27:56.629
And that was where it was different.

27:56.649 --> 27:59.272
And that was the way they sold me on A&M in those days.

28:00.093 --> 28:01.374
And that was true.

28:02.055 --> 28:07.821
Did any Aggie try to

28:09.033 --> 28:35.125
sell you on anything that was goofy was there anything you know i think there was a lot of things that were done kind of illegal in those days and everything i understand i really think i was kind of a high profile recruit and the and i think there was such a fear of that that even my summer job that a m got for me was a crummy job you know i mean it's hard to work for a guest company and i had to dig

28:35.459 --> 28:45.817
holes in the alleys to fix gas leaks, and since I was the youngest guy, I had to crawl down in the hole, you know, and that was the kind of summer job I got, and it wasn't even an Aggie that had the company.

28:45.837 --> 28:48.943
That was the summer after Husker.

28:48.963 --> 28:50.125
And do you remember what the pay was?

28:50.826 --> 28:54.953
Minimum wage, and that would have been a dollar and a quarter an hour.

28:55.456 --> 29:10.600
And they were, and OU, I heard the guys that went to OU got oil field jobs making, you know, five dollars an hour and all this stuff and, you know, but they were so afraid of, you know, of getting in trouble and it worked out just fine.

29:12.784 --> 29:15.608
The weekend you were here you went to a baseball game.

29:15.588 --> 29:16.669
anything else?

29:16.910 --> 29:20.955
Well, Coach Thomas wasn't here because of the Southwest Conference track meets going on.

29:20.995 --> 29:21.696
It was up in Fayetteville.

29:21.716 --> 29:26.922
And they flew him back on a private plane with Danny Roberts and I think probably Ted Nelson came back on that tour.

29:27.623 --> 29:30.647
Danny was the Southwest Conference champion, record holder in the shot put.

29:31.608 --> 29:38.197
And Ted Nelson was a great quarter miler from Andrews, Texas that was a legend already in West Texas.

29:38.657 --> 29:43.283
I remember going to a track meet when I was a sophomore in high school in Andrews.

29:43.769 --> 29:46.252
and they had his picture on the cover of the telephone book.

29:46.272 --> 29:47.814
I said, guys, big time.

29:48.395 --> 29:51.379
Coach Thomas did something that was kind of unique in recruiting.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.664
Probably wasn't as flashy as a lot of the recruiters are today.

29:56.305 --> 29:59.389
He sent me a postcard from every track meet.

30:00.730 --> 30:04.415
It was just a little A&M postcard, but on the top they had caricatures.

30:05.496 --> 30:09.562
And they had old Sarge, which is not, he's on the outs today a little bit.

30:09.582 --> 30:12.325
They don't, the image, you know, but he's a rough looking,

30:12.743 --> 30:17.008
guy in uniform doing particular different sports.

30:17.028 --> 30:19.771
For track he was a shot putter.

30:19.791 --> 30:28.720
And you know that's a little touch, but he wrote me this and he said well Ted Nelson did this and Danny threw this and just went down the list and I knew those guys.

30:28.780 --> 30:31.163
When I got down here to visit I knew all those guys.

30:31.924 --> 30:37.570
I'm not sure he even thought it out and planned it that well, but I mean I felt like I was part of the team before we got down here.

30:37.972 --> 31:03.186
and uh but anyway they flew back on a private plane coach that thomas didn't like flying on little planes and he was scared flying back and had some rough weather to get back and but i was well taken care of by shelby metcalf who was taking me around and that's always a calculated risk you either took to shelby or he didn't in those days and i took to him and a matter of fact

31:03.166 --> 31:08.758
I liked him so much I wanted to play basketball, even though I didn't think that was a thing to do.

31:08.799 --> 31:09.600
And eventually I did.

31:10.542 --> 31:11.043
Played for him.

31:11.484 --> 31:15.654
Now, what was your impression of the campus when you saw him?

31:15.674 --> 31:21.647
Well, it was my kind of place because it was about 8,000 students then.
