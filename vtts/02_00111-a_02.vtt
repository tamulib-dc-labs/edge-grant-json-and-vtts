WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:06.104
Nicknames for the president's quarters. One of 
them was David Morgan. It was called the House of

00:07.446 --> 00:10.230
David. Oh, I didn't know that. Let's see. 
Gilchrist? Not very late. Harrington? Uncle

00:22.748 --> 00:24.290
Tom's cat. Oh, okay. Very good, very good. Rudder?

00:35.907 --> 00:39.352
The General's Shack, I wonder, or something like 
that. I don't know. I don't recall. Describe how

00:44.279 --> 00:51.629
the students' relations with a faculty member. 
What was their manner, their style, if they came to

00:52.029 --> 00:57.857
your office? Were they respectful? Oh, yes. 
Always respectful. Always, yes, sir.

01:04.066 --> 01:05.728
Cooperative. We helped a good many student 
conferences.

01:14.506 --> 01:16.668
Actually, we required the head of the department. 
Not only a requirement, it was something we wanted

01:16.688 --> 01:19.011
to do. But, oh yes, they were always

01:19.771 --> 01:26.559
respectful. Even Murray Trimble. Remember 
Murray Trimble? A fine football player. He lost a

01:34.666 --> 01:37.069
hand? He lost a hand, yeah. He got in big trouble and 
finally got expelled. He was a bit of a roughneck,

01:42.435 --> 01:50.846
but I had Murray in

01:42.435 --> 01:50.846
class. During those years, particularly the 50s 
and 60s, describe for me a typical work week for

01:51.506 --> 02:00.077
you. Normally you left here and got to the 
office... About what time? Well, usually I make a

02:05.240 --> 02:07.142
class. We talk

02:07.823 --> 02:14.550
quite a number of hours. Pretty much classes and 
conferences pretty much took up my day. So you, did

02:20.937 --> 02:24.681
you walk over or drive? I drove more often than 
you'd think, actually. So you'd leave here at

02:29.607 --> 02:32.550
about what time?

02:35.450 --> 02:51.111
The

02:35.450 --> 02:51.111
students, and your work day, so you were, as far as 
you recall, by the late 50s, what was a normal

02:35.450 --> 02:51.111
teaching load? When did it go down from 18 hours? 
About 15 hours. About 15. About 15. And about how

02:56.510 --> 03:01.995
many of those were introductory courses and how 
many advanced? Do you remember? Well, actually,

03:03.296 --> 03:09.602
the English department was still the service 
department. We didn't have any graduate courses.

03:12.844 --> 03:16.748
Senior level was as far as we went. No, it was a 
question. No, about how many of them were junior,

03:18.870 --> 03:24.795
senior compared to the introductory freshman

03:29.028 --> 03:34.617
Well, we've had a great many more freshman

03:29.028 --> 03:34.617
sections. I can't give you any specific numbers 
really, but we had more freshman sections because

03:34.637 --> 03:45.313
everyone had taken these freshman composition 
and maybe the sophomore literature course. Above

03:45.333 --> 03:51.984
that, a number were taken as electives, so of 
course there were fewer. In the English

03:52.004 --> 03:55.930
department, what were some of the popular 
elective courses?

04:00.044 --> 04:02.647
Well, quite a few took the technical ride. A lot of 
students thought that was useful to them, and a lot

04:05.170 --> 04:11.198
of them took that as a popular course. Then a rather 
surprising number elected to Shakespeare. And

04:15.623 --> 04:24.714
then other than that, I think probably both the 
American Lit Survey and the English Lit Survey.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.997
What were your favorite sections to teach? Well, I 
was always interested in the American Literature

04:27.550 --> 04:31.615
and I taught all of that. I taught a novelist course 
and I taught the American Literature survey, but

04:31.675 --> 04:40.326
we taught across the board. I taught technical 
writing. I even taught speech class. So, you would

04:45.653 --> 04:54.925
leave here, leave the house... Well, I worked 
between 7.30 and 8 and almost always had an 8

04:45.653 --> 04:54.925
o'clock class. I drove that short distance a good 
deal of the time. So I wouldn't arrive there

04:59.397 --> 05:02.121
trenched in sweat. Where did you park?

05:06.787 --> 05:10.813
In the academic building parking lot. There was no 
big deal about parking in those days. And there was

05:13.397 --> 05:14.318
no fee. No fee. Did you come home for lunch? Yes. And 
then you went back, and normally your day on the

05:19.485 --> 05:25.013
campus would end at about what time? Oh, maybe very 
gorgeous classes I have there. Three or four

05:32.615 --> 05:34.738
o'clock. And six-day week, because it's Tuesday, 
Thursday, Saturday. What did you and your family,

05:39.343 --> 05:48.874
what the social life, as the girls got a little 
older, what did you all do in the community?

05:51.807 --> 05:58.273
Well, of course, they were wrapped up in school 
activities, and we did all the PTA stuff. And of

05:58.293 --> 06:07.120
course, we went to all the athletic events, and any 
concert or play or anything that we could find.

06:08.942 --> 06:12.305
Where were the concerts and the plays held on the 
campus? Guyon Hall. And make believe that I had

06:13.626 --> 06:16.768
never been in Guyon Hall. Describe it for me. Well, 
it was sort of a Greek. The Greek Revival started a

06:21.608 --> 06:27.936
lovely old building, and I really hated to see it 
built. And it seated 1,200 men? About 1,200 men.

06:31.220 --> 06:36.066
They had religious emphasis week in those days. 
Filled it up for those services. Do you remember

06:40.972 --> 06:48.681
some famous people that came to speak or perform? 
Well, I certainly should, but I'm afraid I don't.

06:52.135 --> 07:02.691
because I've heard some of the students talk about 
the big bands that came and performed in Sabisa for

06:52.135 --> 07:02.691
their dances. Who were the, in the 50s, who were the 
key administrators? Who was the dean of arts and

07:10.544 --> 07:14.350
sciences during those years?

07:17.715 --> 07:19.678
I knew that was coming. Was Dr. Abbott in there? I 
suspect so. And then Frank Hubert comes in 59.

07:30.006 --> 07:30.667
Yeah. All right, let's talk about him. Describe 
him as the dean. He was very effective.

07:41.680 --> 07:56.898
He took some ribbing in there about having been an 
high school band director and so on, but he was very

07:41.680 --> 07:56.898
approachable and very effective.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.905
Mr. Rutter comes in January of 59. Were there any 
faculty comments about his selection, his

08:04.026 --> 08:10.894
appointment?

08:13.270 --> 08:14.051
as you recall.

08:17.396 --> 08:18.497
What about David Morgan? How did the faculty see 
him?

08:27.330 --> 08:41.910
Well, I think

08:27.330 --> 08:41.910
that there was some satisfaction that an 
outsider, so to speak, had. I don't remember

08:42.548 --> 08:52.480
really what things he did, but I think he had a 
pretty high approval

08:42.548 --> 08:52.480
rating. I got here at about the same time Mr. Rutter 
did, and at first I wasn't impressed with Mr.

08:52.581 --> 09:09.822
Rutter's academic style and ability, but I later 
came to realize that he had many other abilities.

09:10.679 --> 09:18.188
Let's see, describe College Station in the 50s and 
60s as a very separate town. Well, it, of course,

09:18.428 --> 09:27.258
was still very small, and I think people felt very 
close and felt very safe. Dr. Morgan went to

09:27.318 --> 09:39.252
California every summer to read in the Huntington 
Library, and I remember one summer he was leaving,

09:27.318 --> 09:39.252
and I said, well, if you need anything, you know, 
And

09:39.485 --> 10:09.205
people

09:39.485 --> 10:09.205
I presume have always parked over here. and for 
football games. Have you ever had any incidents,

10:12.516 --> 10:22.004
problems on a football weekend of somebody that 
parked in front of the house and bothered

10:12.516 --> 10:22.004
anything? No. Never? They're really regulating 
that now. But never many times have we had that.

10:32.413 --> 10:39.259
Back to campus, who are some of the key individuals 
that you, other than maybe the president and so

10:39.678 --> 10:47.290
forth, some other key individuals that you think 
helped make A&M in the 50s, 60s, 70s?

10:54.741 --> 10:57.165
Advisors, counselors, administrators?

11:04.516 --> 11:05.357
Wayne Stark. Yeah, Wayne Stark. What role did he 
play that made the thing better? Really had

11:10.804 --> 11:14.829
tremendous influence. He involved so many 
students at the Memorial Student Center. Taught

11:21.537 --> 11:27.485
them so much, actually, by involving them in the 
activities. He made all kinds of trips, taking

11:27.505 --> 11:36.516
students to cultural events.

11:41.272 --> 11:44.355
said they don't have. Tremendous influence. It 
made all the difference in the world. Did you ever

11:49.761 --> 11:51.463
go on any of those? Yes. Describe one of those. 
Well, I remember going to Houston

11:54.546 --> 12:08.661
to and

11:54.546 --> 12:08.661
we met with John Lindsey. Lindsey, yeah, John 
Lindsey. Thereafter, he took us to a club, to which

12:10.887 --> 12:17.854
he built a home, and we just did the job. I had some 
drinks. What was the effect on the students of that

12:18.935 --> 12:21.657
weekend? Well, I think they were a little bit 
awestruck. But I think they enjoyed it. I think

12:30.345 --> 12:40.455
that for, we got to go on one of those, and I got the 
impression that this was almost like helping

12:30.345 --> 12:40.455
those students to raise their sights. that you 
could become

12:41.026 --> 12:50.557
able to enjoy this kind of art and culture and so 
forth? Yeah, I think he had that. Pinky Downs.

12:56.143 --> 13:00.968
Yeah, I met Pinky almost as soon as I arrived. I 
think I was in the campus post office. He came up,

13:05.613 --> 13:08.957
hi, I'm Pinky Downs. Where are you from?

13:14.268 --> 13:22.279
And Pinky always gave his prediction that the 
bonfire

13:14.268 --> 13:22.279
was going to be Texas. Now, before the MSC is built, 
what was the center for extracurricular

13:22.299 --> 13:32.933
activities? Well, basically there wasn't 
anything. Certainly back when we came here, when

13:40.915 --> 13:49.884
the girls came down from Texas University for 
dances and stuff, they had a rough time. Couldn't

13:49.904 --> 13:51.766
find a bathroom. And it wasn't a whole lot better 
until we came to get the center. I suppose it's

13:55.169 --> 13:57.992
pretty simple. And there were a few activities at 
the old YMCA, I understand. Yes, there were some at

14:02.096 --> 14:04.578
the YMCA. Was Mr. Cashin still active? Yes, yes. I 
know nothing about him. Please tell about him.

14:11.493 --> 14:16.878
Well, I really don't remember too much about 
himself. He was a much-loved person, I know. A lot

14:20.862 --> 14:23.285
of students flocked to the YMCA. I know he did a lot 
of counseling, but I suppose, in a sense, he was one

14:23.305 --> 14:31.473
of those key figures. Where did a student in the 50s 
and 60s, where did a student go for advice,

14:31.653 --> 14:37.939
counsel? I have

14:39.539 --> 15:06.289
the belief that in that era, faculty members 
thought that one of their unwritten

14:39.539 --> 15:06.289
responsibilities was to be a counselor in 
addition to being a teacher that teaching

15:07.197 --> 15:12.003
extended far beyond the classroom. Yeah, I think 
so. I've been proud of A&M on that score. I think

15:16.590 --> 15:19.513
that attitude has been there. We tried to make 
personal contact with students. Actually, I

15:25.902 --> 15:30.208
think we're still trying, although it's pretty 
tough. All right, we were talking about

15:30.228 --> 15:33.492
presidents.

15:35.547 --> 15:41.073
Jack Williams, what was your impression of him and 
his role as president here?

15:44.416 --> 15:47.139
Well, I was very favorably impressed with him. He 
was one I knew, more

15:48.521 --> 15:58.511
or less. Certainly had a rather high opinion. Had a 
tough time health-wise.

16:07.002 --> 16:13.030
What do you think were some, in your, let's see, 
what, 40 years?

16:15.994 --> 16:16.715
How long I taught? Yeah. Well, I taught for 32 
years. 32. Yeah. Well, my slot was 46 to 78. Oh,

16:25.766 --> 16:26.387
okay. And I've had 21 years since then to forget 
things. Right. During those years...

16:35.032 --> 16:52.954
if there were people that you could pull out and 
thank them and pat them, who were those people that

16:35.032 --> 16:52.954
made a difference for this school?

16:52.974 --> 16:57.280
Well, I suppose all the presidents did to some 
extent. I mean, William Stark certainly made a

16:57.300 --> 17:01.545
difference around here.

17:08.984 --> 17:12.608
Do any of the presidents, do you have any favorites 
among them?

17:17.813 --> 17:24.119
What are some of the key decisions you think that 
were made during, that were very important to A&M

17:17.813 --> 17:24.119
today? Well, we integrated for one thing. I 
remember very well when we conducted the summer

17:28.684 --> 17:34.290
school enrollment speech of all. It was a long 
table. And the word was passed along to us, there

17:36.372 --> 17:46.385
will be black students enrolled in the role, and it 
was a peaceful museum. And then somebody made that

17:46.405 --> 17:47.786
decision. And of course, eventually, the 
commission went on. Do you remember any, even a

17:54.315 --> 17:58.900
hint of an incident over integration? I don't 
either. Yeah, that was much easier than burning

18:01.844 --> 18:04.287
the windows. I now know that Mr. Rudder was a key 
person in getting those students here that summer

18:06.616 --> 18:18.307
because he called the Pentagon and had them send, 
as they normally would send, Army personnel to

18:06.616 --> 18:18.307
finish a degree. And I now know that he called and 
said, send some, including some black students,

18:19.167 --> 18:29.477
no academic danger, no conduct problem. And then 
when the fall began, since everything had gone

18:29.497 --> 18:34.341
well in the summer, someone couldn't organize a 
group, say it won't work. It had worked. Do you

18:40.305 --> 18:49.354
remember, as women began, do you remember any 
kinds of, any incidents or awkward moments or

18:40.305 --> 18:49.354
pranks?

18:56.281 --> 19:02.927
No, I don't think anything much happened until the 
melodies and business came along. Speaking of the

19:03.397 --> 19:11.150
Pentagon, one of my brightest black students was a 
Marine, and he was from Maine. We were back from the

19:11.170 --> 19:16.538
New England trip, and I said, we're going to our 
country. We're going to Bar Harbor. You mean

19:18.742 --> 19:21.286
Bahama. He was a regular

19:21.346 --> 19:27.636
Marine. Yes, he was. And he had been sent here. 
We've been sent here. I was surprised, but there he

19:31.610 --> 19:37.176
was.

19:38.417 --> 19:38.918
Let's see. We

19:40.479 --> 19:48.208
mentioned coeducation, integration, 
non-compulsory core. Do you remember the

19:49.850 --> 19:54.835
beginning of the graduate program in English? 
Yes. How did it come about? Well, it began in the

19:57.802 --> 20:07.632
late 50s, and we began to, we worked with Dean Buber 
on that, and began to talk about it. I believe,

20:07.652 --> 20:19.185
Steve John...

20:07.652 --> 20:19.185
Abbott? I

20:20.127 --> 20:26.094
swear that name escapes me. I believe he was head at 
the time. Okay. And we talked with David Burton and

20:29.277 --> 20:38.087
he talked about perhaps starting a private 
program, maybe in American literature only.

20:38.107 --> 20:44.194
Well, we wanted to go farther than that, of course, 
and we did. So we dug into it, and we had to have a

20:44.967 --> 20:54.558
biography of each professor who would teach a 
regular course, and so on. We fought all that out in

20:54.578 --> 20:58.903
the 1950s. And were there any snags, as you 
remember? Or did it pretty well go forward? Well,

21:04.450 --> 21:05.611
it pretty well went along. I don't recall any major 
snags. And when did the doctoral program, were you

21:09.736 --> 21:13.861
still a faculty member when the doctoral program 
began? Yes. any key people that deserve a pat on the

21:14.870 --> 21:17.973
back there? Well, certainly this department head 
worked like a tiger in Washington today. And Lee

21:25.121 --> 21:29.426
Martin was very active. Was Maxwell the dean by 
this time? David Maxwell? No, we had that before

21:33.210 --> 21:35.272
Maxwell. Oh, okay. So it would still have been 
Hubert, I guess.

21:42.320 --> 21:44.843
Was English one of the pioneer humanities, social 
sciences graduate area? I

21:49.570 --> 21:53.997
believe so. I think so. Let's see. Do you remember 
anything that students ever did to go out of their

21:58.364 --> 22:08.721
way to be polite or show appreciation for 
anything?

22:18.067 --> 22:24.877
I don't believe so, beyond coming up at the end and 
saying, enjoy the course, that kind of thing. Did

22:24.897 --> 22:30.986
any student or parent of a student ever attempt to 
intimidate you? Unless my student, my son, passes

22:33.029 --> 22:43.124
this or that, did anybody ever attempt to in any way 
bribe you with anything? No, never did. I only had

22:45.910 --> 22:50.354
one parent-student incident whatsoever. I had a 
student who was about 25 years old who was in a

22:50.374 --> 23:02.685
technical

22:50.374 --> 23:02.685
writing class. And he didn't hand in his term 
paper. He didn't show up for the examination. And

23:07.149 --> 23:08.850
actually he just disappeared. I got the call from 
the parent to see if I had any idea what he was. But I

23:14.195 --> 23:15.276
didn't. So I got, I don't remember who I got in touch 
with, but I got in touch with some authority. I

23:19.781 --> 23:24.410
said, we have a student who apparently 
disappeared. Well, about three days later, they

23:24.430 --> 23:31.243
discovered him hiding out in a dorm. There was 
something wrong with the young man. He certainly,

23:35.751 --> 23:37.635
in age, won't pass away. He was scared to death. He 
had me in on that paper. He was scared to come to the

23:41.297 --> 23:44.241
exam. And his father came up here, and I remember 
meeting with the father in the state. I wasn't

23:51.652 --> 23:56.358
going to matter

23:51.652 --> 23:56.358
to him. He got in touch later, and I eventually let 
him finish the paper. And I believe he came back and

24:02.728 --> 24:05.091
took the exam. Do you recall any what you now in 
hindsight think of as administrative

24:06.522 --> 24:18.121
interference with the way the academic program 
was operated in English?

24:25.333 --> 24:29.020
In terms of was there a merit salary system? Yes. 
And the promotions were handled, as far as you were

24:31.818 --> 24:37.688
concerned, with reasonable fairness and equity?

24:42.416 --> 24:47.765
Who are some special students that you remember 
now with pride and joy?

24:53.475 --> 24:54.737
Well, I've always been. I've always been fond of 
Dick. Of course, he's a very successful attorney.

25:01.101 --> 25:03.023
He's in San Antonio now. I had Jack Pardee as a 
student. Oh, did you? Describe him as a student.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.471
Well, Jack, I had him in only this one class. And he 
was very respectful. Big man on campus, but he

25:17.179 --> 25:20.783
didn't throw any weight around. He was a good 
student. And he'd gone to a small high school.

25:24.985 --> 25:26.106
Because he was a... Yes. Jack made it be, as I 
recall, a technical writing class,

25:27.928 --> 25:33.094
well-deserved. Certainly very pleasant. I have 
written to him a time or two. He did something

25:38.320 --> 25:39.621
notable. And I had Henry Cisneros.

25:46.209 --> 25:47.090
Was he a good student? Oh, excellent student. I 
would have expected him. He was an A student. I'm

25:51.034 --> 25:51.775
just... Sorry he's had troubles. Let's go back to 
Pardee for a second. Did, under Bear Bryant, was

25:59.143 --> 26:09.694
there ever any, did anybody ever tried to 
influence you in grading an athlete? Not

26:09.714 --> 26:14.619
directly, but he had a scholastic advisor. Jerry 
Claiborne? Jerry Claiborne, who later coached

26:16.341 --> 26:20.885
where, I don't remember. Kentucky? Kentucky, 
yeah. Anyway, Jerry would come around and ask how

26:23.075 --> 26:28.902
the students were getting along. He would stand 
there and twirl his 5-8 cap of tea and say, how's

26:28.922 --> 26:36.352
this? He never really put any pressure. Did any 
other coach ever, in any sport, ever attempt to ask

26:39.316 --> 26:47.967
for any special favors? Not for me. Did anyone in 
the Corps?

26:54.125 --> 27:01.137
And you didn't hear about any board member's son or 
any general's son? No, I didn't. No, I guess I was

27:02.680 --> 27:04.303
lucky. Other special students, you mentioned 
Stick Stengel and Jack Pardee, others that you

27:05.465 --> 27:12.117
remember with pride?

27:18.863 --> 27:31.839
Well, I remember way back there was Jim Pye, the one 
I mentioned that was involved with computers.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.061
He's done extremely well. I haven't heard from him 
for a long time. He's a senior engineer with ABN. I

27:39.930 --> 27:40.230
remember him.

27:43.552 --> 28:09.238
Did you

27:43.552 --> 28:09.238
become involved with any extracurricular 
student groups? Oh yes, I remember students from

28:09.590 --> 28:12.834
that, yeah. Oh yeah, I did a lot of that. I coached 
Dubey, and I was on the, I worked with Scola for

28:14.276 --> 28:24.870
years, and I was on the MSC Council. I remember, I 
remember Chet Edwards

28:24.890 --> 28:29.856
was one of them. He was a guest representative. 
From Waco and Temple, yes. I remember Chet very

28:32.760 --> 28:36.625
well. Oh, I remember. John Rogers, he was a pagan in

28:38.598 --> 28:48.592
the insurance company in Dallas. Bud Whitney 
actually

28:48.612 --> 28:53.919
started this corner. And then there was John 
Samuels, the New York millionaire. He was the

28:58.886 --> 29:03.172
sponsor of the opera and all that sort of thing. He 
was one of my debaters.

29:08.247 --> 29:27.403
If you could go back, this is a very broad question, 
if you could go back and make any changes in

29:08.247 --> 29:27.403
decisions or procedures, what would you change, 
being blessed with hindsight?

29:34.319 --> 29:47.357
I was asking you to offer advice based on your 
experience, anything you would have changed then

29:34.319 --> 29:47.357
and or advice to give to leaders now about A&M. 
Well, I would have tried to change then and would

29:48.939 --> 29:52.965
suggest changing now. It would make an effort to 
broaden the student experience. It's always...

30:02.669 --> 30:12.560
bothered me the whole time I was here, that the 
attitude seemed to be to train people rather than

30:02.669 --> 30:12.560
to broadly educate them. To broadly educate them 
was what I think ought to be done. And if there are

30:15.684 --> 30:23.252
aspirations to be a top ten university, some of 
that has to come. I would think that would be an

30:24.393 --> 30:29.419
impossibility unless we added something in the 
fine arts During

30:30.260 --> 30:54.580
those years that you were active on the campus, who 
were the key people whom you thought were most

30:30.260 --> 30:54.580
sensitive to this need to broaden and to deepen?

31:05.967 --> 31:15.099
Well, I guess all English faculty felt that way, 
and I'm sure that some of the other people in

31:05.967 --> 31:15.099
liberal arts did. What about key campus leaders? 
Well, I think David Maxwell would like very much to

31:18.084 --> 31:27.576
have done that, definitely. And it seems to me that 
Jack Williams had that attitude.
