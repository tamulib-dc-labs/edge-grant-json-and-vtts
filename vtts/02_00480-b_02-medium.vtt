WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:05.961
The Germans started coming in to surrender. So we 
went on up to Paris. We'd done all we could. And

00:11.787 --> 00:16.991
stayed in the house of one of those requisitioned, 
beautiful gods there. An ancient place that they

00:17.011 --> 00:22.296
requisitioned back then. And on the night the war 
was declared to be over, oh hell, I might as well

00:22.316 --> 00:29.603
tell the story. An old friend was commanding a 
fighter outfit. came in with his Red Cross girl,

00:32.903 --> 00:48.622
and he didn't have any place to sleep, so I said, 
well, you can have my place, and if you take me

00:32.903 --> 00:48.622
across town to the Ritz, which is a commandeered 
hotel, I could get us a place there. In fact, I

00:48.642 --> 00:51.005
called them there, and they sure could. Well, we 
started across town, and Paris was just like that,

00:52.046 --> 01:01.678
and to make a long story short, it was a long time 
getting there, because We had to, we got crowded

01:02.452 --> 01:10.280
and finally a big truck came by and we just crept 
behind it and went way around and got me out. Next

01:11.201 --> 01:18.129
morning, another old friend showed up at 
breakfast and asked me, and I said, well, I'm going

01:11.201 --> 01:18.129
home as quick as I can. I haven't got any way to go 
yet. He said, hell, come on with me. And he was

01:22.434 --> 01:27.179
stationed at Casablanca and I had to be 17 up there, 
one of those messed up ones. And took me down there

01:28.500 --> 01:31.243
and got me out on the first match flight back to the 
stage for Washington. And as I went to go up the

01:38.453 --> 01:47.624
ramp, the sergeant stopped me and said I didn't 
have the right shots or something like that. And I

01:47.664 --> 01:51.869
looked at him and said, sergeant, you don't think 
that's going to keep me off this airplane? I looked

01:52.469 --> 01:54.071
like what I was, I guess. And he said, no, sir. And so 
I ended up in Washington. And I guess it was around 2

01:57.595 --> 02:01.500
o'clock in the morning. And a young woman got me a 
hotel room,

02:02.493 --> 02:11.303
and I went to it and got a little sleep until in the 
morning. See, I had to do this thing with

02:11.363 --> 02:20.434
the OSS, which was responsible for the other end of 
the pipeline. Right, the OSS. Yeah. So they wanted

02:23.257 --> 02:25.360
to debrief you. I had to. There's no way about it. 
And I had to write a report for the air staff. Okay. I

02:33.425 --> 02:36.288
wanted to get that done as quick as I could. So when I 
finished the day, I went back to the hotel, got down

02:36.328 --> 02:43.634
to Muscovy's and started writing it out. And the 
hotel clerk called me and says, why aren't you out

02:44.775 --> 02:49.299
of that room? And I said, God damn, I registered in 
last night. And he said, you can't keep it. We've

02:55.125 --> 02:56.086
got to go. You've got to go right now. I said, I 
haven't got any place to go. And he said, well,

02:59.549 --> 03:00.990
you've got to get out of here. This was a hero's 
welcome. I didn't know any of this. I'd been gone so

03:07.837 --> 03:10.980
long I didn't know that Washington was jammed full 
of people. So I said well let me try to find a room and

03:12.182 --> 03:16.887
I called and there was not a room. And this I didn't 
want to do but I had to. I called an old friend and

03:19.269 --> 03:23.094
asked him if I could stay with him. So I did. That was 
what you might call a year's welcome. Now I don't

03:28.820 --> 03:31.663
mean to say that people didn't weren't very good to 
me, they were. But I didn't know, for example,

03:35.431 --> 03:40.717
about rationing. I suppose it had it, but I never 
had to pay attention to it. Well, this man and his

03:44.921 --> 03:55.812
wife, old friends, asked some women, friends of 
people that I'd seen in Europe, they hadn't got

03:44.921 --> 03:55.812
back yet, over to dinner. Meantime, somebody had 
handed me a handful of ration coupons and God knows

03:56.492 --> 04:01.397
what. tickets. I didn't even know what they were. 
So when I mentioned that, these ladies, and they

04:05.634 --> 04:10.962
grabbed them and took them. They needed them. They 
needed them bad. I didn't know any of that. So there

04:14.027 --> 04:17.672
was a good deal of getting used to for me. But other 
than that, it was all right. Now what did you write

04:22.279 --> 04:24.563
in your OSS report?

04:30.431 --> 04:30.912
Well, Some of it from back then was secret, not 
much. The one thing that I hated to do, I had to do,

04:37.209 --> 04:52.124
was write a very derogatory report on a man who had 
not performed the duty that he had been ordered to

04:37.209 --> 04:52.124
perform. And the upshot of that was that it ended up 
in a file As you may know, there is a personnel file

05:01.756 --> 05:09.843
that's open at large, in board. There's another 
file which isn't, and that's where it ended up. And

05:15.989 --> 05:17.770
I didn't even know because I didn't care. I'd done 
what I had to do. I hated to do it because I'd known

05:19.232 --> 05:21.514
this man well. He'd worked for me in the past. But he 
didn't perform well in the POW camp? It was

05:27.199 --> 05:29.381
something that I don't want to go in further with. 
He's dead too, I might add, but Years later, an old

05:31.642 --> 05:48.967
friend that I had in Washington who was a 
specialist in military court cases talked to me

05:31.642 --> 05:48.967
about it because he'd been hired to defend this man 
in a case he'd been kicked out of the service. Oh,

05:50.169 --> 05:51.891
later he was kicked out of the service? And that 
report was used and that was not what brought him

05:53.013 --> 05:58.881
before the being kicked out. It was another 
action.

06:05.024 --> 06:09.331
But that report was brought out in the case, and the 
man was kicked out. It was an appeal case, one of

06:09.752 --> 06:16.523
those final appeal cases, which my friend, the 
lawyer, was defending. Well, was this report

06:16.763 --> 06:23.755
discussing the situation in prison, or in the POW 
camp? Oh, I don't want to go into it. It was just one

06:25.617 --> 06:28.420
of those things that you have to do that you hate to 
do. No, not the camp, not with this man, not dealing

06:28.941 --> 06:32.244
with a man. I'm talking about the other part of the 
report. Well, the other part had to do really with

06:35.248 --> 06:38.351
the interests. It was partly an interrogation by 
the people who are on this end of the pipeline. And

06:45.038 --> 06:49.903
it was a tenuous, tortuous pipeline, but 
nevertheless it was there and I was on one end of it.

06:51.204 --> 06:53.607
And you see, I had to tell them what it was like from 
that end. The things, the really important things

07:00.661 --> 07:06.951
that we tried to get back either didn't get back or 
were ignored.

07:10.677 --> 07:15.183
Some of the other things did, and perhaps they did a 
little good, not much, I'm sure. But a really

07:16.325 --> 07:24.117
useful intelligence

07:16.325 --> 07:24.117
from our point of view. Not about us, but about what 
the Air Force could do. It wasn't worthwhile. Now,

07:32.918 --> 07:34.761
can you explain this pipeline? I don't think I 
should. It isn't as though it was quite secret

07:38.347 --> 07:44.917
then, and perhaps it is now, I don't know. But I 
don't think it should. I don't see any purpose to be

07:48.543 --> 07:50.526
served by it. And if it were necessary to use a gun, 
something which I think is highly unlikely, you

07:52.177 --> 08:03.340
really wouldn't want to discuss too much. Now when 
you came back from the service, or from the war, you

08:05.484 --> 08:10.675
were a colonel. Were you thinking about getting 
out of the military? A lot of people at this time, of

08:16.295 --> 08:19.859
course, there was a rapid demobilization. Were 
you thinking about retiring from the military and

08:20.319 --> 08:27.447
becoming an engineer, or were you thinking about 
finishing out and having a full career? Not at that

08:28.528 --> 08:29.489
time. I did not too long after that. I had an 
opportunity to make some money. I made it, too, if

08:35.795 --> 08:37.557
I'd been out and done it. What happened in that 
instance was that the Korean War came on and I just

08:38.026 --> 08:46.359
couldn't, in due conscience, I couldn't leave 
then. And then the next time, well, be explicit

08:47.782 --> 08:58.719
about it, the guy that I furnished the paper to 
said, oh shit, tore it up and threw it in the

08:47.782 --> 08:58.719
wastebasket. And I said, well, I'll do it later. 
And it turns out that my duty It was pleasant. Well

09:06.341 --> 09:12.447
what duty did you have right after you came back? 
You were assigned as Deputy Personnel 8 Air

09:12.487 --> 09:15.671
Training Command. Was this in Washington? No, no. 
This was first at Fort Worth and then in Barksdale.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.302
We moved the headquarters into Barksdale. It's 
the headquarters which is now in San Antonio. And

09:28.432 --> 09:39.107
you were a colonel at the time, and were you, many 
people, of course, had temporary rank at this

09:28.432 --> 09:39.107
time, and they were lowered in rank. Did this 
happen to you? Oh, no. No, this did happen to a good

09:42.132 --> 09:46.598
many of my contemporaries. Yeah. All that I can 
remember were made again later. Yeah. No. No,

09:54.609 --> 09:56.532
there's a peculiarity in it. I was serving in what 
they call general slots, table organization

09:57.929 --> 10:06.403
slots. From that time until the time I was 
promoted, which time I was serving in a colonel

10:07.625 --> 10:14.115
slot. This is an anomaly in the service. And it 
doesn't happen too often, but it happens. It did to

10:20.706 --> 10:21.507
me anyway.

10:24.457 --> 10:28.083
I'm just saying that those particular things 
don't mean a hell of a lot. Okay, so were you at the

10:28.303 --> 10:33.451
Air Training Command then until how long? When did 
you go to the Air War College? Oh, it's when it first

10:35.975 --> 10:37.578
opened up. I guess that would be in the summer of 46,

10:37.598 --> 10:47.814
wouldn't it be? 47.

10:52.216 --> 10:56.841
I guess that's when you're 47. And what did you 
think of going back to school at the Air War

10:56.861 --> 11:00.004
College? I enjoyed it.

11:06.490 --> 11:07.311
Was it valuable? Was it a valuable experience? I 
don't like to answer the question that directly.

11:16.020 --> 11:20.164
See, I spent two years in school when I was there. 
What I learned out of it probably could have been

11:20.482 --> 11:23.906
learned in about a year.

11:26.789 --> 11:32.054
Some of what I learned, for example, was applied in 
the National War College that I'd already had.

11:33.696 --> 11:47.350
It's hard to evaluate military education because 
part of it is an association with people who have

11:33.696 --> 11:47.350
had different experiences than your own. you 
learn from them rather than the curriculum. And I

11:51.207 --> 11:53.149
think it can be done much quicker. It's pretty 
goddamn expensive, too. Oh, yes, it is expensive.

11:57.895 --> 11:59.236
It definitely is. And after your two years there, 
you were assigned to the Office for Atomic Energy.

12:06.985 --> 12:08.247
This must have been about 1949 then? Yeah, I guess 
so. What did you think about the Air Force

12:10.790 --> 12:15.075
splitting from the Army? That happened while I was 
in the school. It is an inevitable.

12:23.799 --> 12:32.367
See, people who were in my type of interest were 
particularly interested in that. We had to depend

12:33.908 --> 12:42.136
on the Army in an ordinance for our armament. 
People in the Army couldn't know less about any

12:46.139 --> 12:51.885
subject than the requirements of air armament. 
They didn't know and they didn't care and we were a

12:52.465 --> 12:56.409
goddamn nuisance to them. We also were 
responsible, the quartermaster was responsible

12:57.590 --> 13:05.819
for furnishing certain items to us. Our mission 
was so different to anything that they'd ever been

13:06.559 --> 13:14.087
familiar with that that was a serious handicap. 
Having said that, and of course I can illustrate it

13:14.624 --> 13:19.389
with personal details, but I don't need to. I want 
to point out that there are certain things that the

13:20.931 --> 13:30.742
Army does very well, and does better than the Air 
Force, which we probably should have left with the

13:20.931 --> 13:30.742
Army instead of taking along. For example? Burial 
service, post exchanges, commissaries,

13:33.165 --> 13:42.555
there are others. certain of the engineering 
fields. But we had to do it the way it was done. And

13:51.893 --> 13:53.816
honestly, it was a must. A lot of people thought it 
was, you know, gung-ho, wild beyond the deal. It

14:00.808 --> 14:01.650
really wasn't. It was the fact that we had to have 
more knowledgeable people in the supporting

14:06.852 --> 14:09.935
functions than we could get in the Army. And that is 
a simple thing to say, but it was goddamn difficult

14:09.955 --> 14:15.920
to work with. And that's the why of it. The whole 
boycott was like everything else like that. It was

14:23.167 --> 14:24.188
a compromise. The Navy didn't want it done. The 
Army didn't want it done. And in consequence, the

14:29.072 --> 14:34.497
triple service deal was a compromise. Not a very 
good one, I might add. But it works. Now during the

14:39.765 --> 14:57.947
same time, not only did President Truman set up the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the three different

14:39.765 --> 14:57.947
branches, but he also started integrating the 
armed forces, which was carried out from 1947

14:39.765 --> 14:57.947
through the Korean War. What was your opinion of 
that?

15:04.919 --> 15:08.443
Oh, this is balderdash, largely.

15:11.727 --> 15:15.110
Let me talk about the best side of it first. When I 
went from the Pentagon up to Sandia Base, that was

15:16.212 --> 15:23.139
an integrated command. The commander was an Army 
officer. I was the Air Force deputy and operations

15:27.744 --> 15:34.572
chief. Navy deputy who was my deputy in 
operations. Nevertheless, I was responsible for

15:39.896 --> 15:43.962
the Air Force guys, the Navy guy, and so forth. This 
worked very well, but you don't know why. Why?

15:48.828 --> 15:54.695
There wasn't a man in it that wasn't specifically 
selected for it. And during that time that I was

15:56.878 --> 16:03.867
there, and I won't go into them because some of them 
are still secret, but When I put the finger on

16:04.859 --> 16:17.801
somebody to do something, and it might be in the 
Pacific, it might be in Europe, it might be in

16:04.859 --> 16:17.801
Kentucky, I didn't have to care whether he was Navy 
or Air Force or Army. He was competent. It's the

16:20.185 --> 16:22.389
only job I've ever had in my life. I can say that. So 
that's the good side of it. But when you just throw

16:27.497 --> 16:30.883
them together, you don't get it. That was unique 
because this was a new thing. It was highly secret.

16:37.677 --> 16:42.267
People thought it wasn't, but they thought it was 
hugely complicated and all that crap. So when you

16:42.868 --> 16:45.875
got a Navy guy, he was the tops. When you got an Air 
Force guy, he wasn't. When you got an Army guy, he

16:47.799 --> 16:50.304
wasn't. That's integration at its best. And this 
was out, this is when you were with the Office of

16:53.847 --> 16:59.713
Atomic Energy. No, that's when I was in the Special 
Weapons Corps. Okay, Special Weapons out at

17:02.015 --> 17:06.680
Sandia, out in New Mexico. Albuquerque. Yeah, in 
Albuquerque. Now, what were some of the special

17:10.004 --> 17:13.688
weapons that you were working on at that time? 
Well, the bomb of course. Yeah, and you were

17:15.069 --> 17:18.893
attempting to, as far as the bomb were doing what 
with it? Attempting to put it in guns? Oh, hell no.

17:25.813 --> 17:27.155
Oh well, I have to back off.

17:30.859 --> 17:31.300
No. Different types of warheads? What you were 
doing,

17:32.341 --> 17:40.510
see you had to take care of them. Had to have them 
ready for specifically the Air Force and mostly

17:40.530 --> 17:47.919
until a lesser degree but an appreciable degree 
the Navy. And at At the same time doing that, you had

17:50.885 --> 17:57.014
to do your goddamnedest to see that you had a better 
one coming on. And equally important, that the

17:58.236 --> 18:06.428
service which was going to use it would be able to 
use it. And the main problem in all that was that it

18:06.448 --> 18:11.615
was so goddamned secret. Some of the people that 
should know things couldn't. Some of the people

18:18.725 --> 18:20.588
who should know things wouldn't.

18:23.369 --> 18:29.776
I'll illustrate that in one brief. When LeMay came 
back from Europe to command SAG and move it to

18:29.796 --> 18:52.060
Omaha, I was in the Pentagon office and we made a 
specific impulsive effort to get him in that

18:29.796 --> 18:52.060
office to convince him that he had to have certain 
information which was under the peculiar

18:53.052 --> 18:53.993
clearance system. They had a clearance for this, 
clearance for that, clearance for that,

18:55.075 --> 19:00.482
clearance for that, and then there was a Q's 
clearance system, which was separate and all

18:55.075 --> 19:00.482
that. Well, obviously, May had the highest 
clearance for Air Force data, top secret, but that

19:01.283 --> 19:11.878
was totally inadequate for this particular work 
under the law at that time. So when we got to the nut

19:11.898 --> 19:18.868
cutting and wanted him to accept a stockpile 
clearance, he wouldn't do it. There were only 13

19:20.570 --> 19:22.873
people at the time that had one, He wouldn't do it. 
And he explained why he wouldn't do it.

19:31.079 --> 19:33.363
He might have to lead a raid. He might feel like he 
had to. And if he had a stockpile clearance, he

19:37.609 --> 19:40.272
couldn't. And so he wasn't going to do it. I'm 
talking about a situation that's long since

19:43.096 --> 19:45.880
passed. Yeah. But it illustrates the problem of 
the time.

19:52.621 --> 19:57.606
If he didn't know what the stockpile was, he didn't 
really know how many bombs he had to deal with. That

19:59.008 --> 20:12.582
targeting system, which I worked on that too,

19:59.008 --> 20:12.582
if you didn't know that, you didn't really know 
whether your targeting system was worth a

19:59.008 --> 20:12.582
goddamn. It's as simple as that. But to eliminate 
those roadblocks which were built into the law,

20:21.089 --> 20:27.877
The first Atomic Energy Act was a real son of a bitch 
of a job. And it certainly was not finished by the

20:27.897 --> 20:31.441
time I left, not by a hell of a lot. But it's 
infinitely better now, infinitely better.

20:37.728 --> 20:45.717
We're getting into that philosophical area that I 
mentioned earlier where the technology is a

20:37.728 --> 20:45.717
given. The technology that we were dealing with in 
my opinion, was relatively simple. Now, the

20:54.461 --> 20:58.427
scientific studies that led into it were not. They 
were, for me, difficult, very difficult. And when

21:02.273 --> 21:14.333
I say that, I want you to know that, well, 
Oppenheimer in the beginning and later Teller and

21:02.273 --> 21:14.333
Gamow were familiars in our office. Sometimes I 
understood what they were talking about,

21:15.730 --> 21:19.094
sometimes I didn't. But the technology of the 
weapons system, I understood that because it was

21:19.114 --> 21:24.680
simple. But the problems were outside of that. The 
problems were what you might call oversimplified

21:28.604 --> 21:35.352
political and administrative. Now during this 
time, or a little bit later, Oppenheimer and

21:35.372 --> 21:45.163
Teller split over the issue of the hydrogen bomb. 
And you were there at the time? It was one of the

21:47.880 --> 21:51.044
country's great tragedies. Oh, would you 
explain?

21:58.615 --> 22:00.697
I hate to do it. It was a tragedy. It was a tragedy of 
the first order.

22:12.793 --> 22:13.294
Let me I don't want to do it, but I'll make one 
illustration. When I was in this office in the

22:18.480 --> 22:41.712
Pentagon, a man in the Joint Chiefs who had been 
assigned to the job called me in because, after

22:18.480 --> 22:41.712
all, I'd known him for years, too, and he knew my 
background, and asked me specifically whether or

22:18.480 --> 22:41.712
not we should design the H-bomb. I said, no, we 
shouldn't, but we've got to. Now, that sounds like

22:47.017 --> 22:49.760
a contradiction, doesn't it? It isn't. That 
illustrates the tragedy of Oppenheimer Teller.

22:59.293 --> 23:00.575
What kind of men were those two? There's been a lot 
written about them by historians, and I just like,

23:01.476 --> 23:07.324
you knew them, and I like your personal view. Both 
great men. Unquestionably great men.

23:14.513 --> 23:20.801
And it's just so very tragic that this had to 
happen. And I don't want to go into the details of

23:22.543 --> 23:33.796
it, but I will say this, that a true blood-blooded, 
everlasting horse's ass was the cause of it. It

23:33.816 --> 23:36.319
didn't have to happen, but it did.

23:42.745 --> 23:48.556
That's not in any of the history books, and I'm not 
going to put it in any of them either. Who are you

23:48.576 --> 23:50.219
referring to? Senator McCarthy? Oh, no. No, no. 
The man I'm talking about is Horst. That's one of

23:56.290 --> 23:57.632
the military service. That ain't to say that the 
military doesn't produce a lot of them. Who is this

24:00.437 --> 24:01.299
man? He's dead. So is Oppenheimer. I don't want to 
talk about it anymore. You can get the book.

24:08.316 --> 24:10.559
There's one recently published on Oppenheimer. I 
don't think I ought to. I'll tell you who can tell

24:14.183 --> 24:17.967
you if he will. And his poise may be utterly 
different to mine. That's Al. I've talked to him

24:22.933 --> 24:24.014
about it. He's a lot closer to it than I was.

24:30.041 --> 24:30.522
I just... I totally deplore it. I don't know what Al 
thinks about it. I've never discussed it with him.

24:35.738 --> 24:37.620
In fact, I never discussed anything much with him. 
I doubt that he even remembers me. I doubt it.

24:48.112 --> 24:54.960
No, I don't see any point in expressing myself on 
this. If you didn't have that goddamn thing on, I

24:55.501 --> 24:57.904
wouldn't mind it. But I just don't believe that I 
should. Now,

25:02.716 --> 25:15.375
let's talk about when the Korean War erupted, 
1950. Where were you at that time? Boy, that's one I

25:19.120 --> 25:20.402
won't forget. I don't know whether you want this in 
the history or not, but it still amuses me.

25:28.454 --> 25:31.879
I was out in San Diego.

25:33.108 --> 25:40.919
the several factors involved in this particular 
undertaking. But the fact of the matter was that

25:40.939 --> 25:51.835
the production in a certain area of the deal I was 
working on was more than really needed. And there

25:53.457 --> 25:55.420
was a way, and it's You've heard of it if you don't 
know about it. It's a breeder system in which you

25:58.268 --> 26:06.037
could get in effect something for nothing and if 
you needed more you could save yourself a lot of

25:58.268 --> 26:06.037
trouble. And it's self-evident if you had all the 
information, that's the key, that the production

26:07.359 --> 26:16.230
was more than we needed. I drew up a study on that. 
Didn't do it all by myself. Had a better man on it

26:21.836 --> 26:24.900
than I am on that kind of thing. And as was customary 
and needed back then, taped the goddamn thing to my

26:25.994 --> 26:39.293
stubble, put my clothes on, put the pistol, 
obligatory pistol. You couldn't go without it if

26:39.313 --> 26:42.097
you had that kind of material with you. And that was 
pretty, look, you can't get that pistol like that

26:42.959 --> 26:48.747
in there. If you need it in the heart. Got in my 
airplane and started to Washington. Well, we had a

26:57.719 --> 27:00.042
station over in Kentucky. It was an Air Force 
station, and I was anywhere responsible for it,

27:00.062 --> 27:05.007
although I did not command it. The commander met me 
at the airplane. I was just going to do a cursory

27:08.811 --> 27:12.355
look and fuel up and go on. And he said the North 
Koreans had invaded. I said, well, so what else is

27:17.360 --> 27:18.762
new? I'd known they'd do that for a long time. I 
thought everybody did. I still don't understand.

27:24.888 --> 27:25.549
Everybody that was familiar with that place and 
knew it. All the people that I'd known that had come

27:28.800 --> 27:31.162
back from there knew it. Nevertheless, I said I 
went on into Washington. The Pentagon was like

27:38.710 --> 27:39.931
that. I ditched

27:39.971 --> 27:55.266
my study when I saw that it was probably without 
question that you could get anybody's attention

27:39.971 --> 27:55.266
at a place where they burned things like that and 
started on home. back to Albuquerque because that

27:56.022 --> 28:04.274
particular operation totally fruitless still 
is, I expect, because of other things. Now,

28:06.137 --> 28:17.513
I stopped in at Maxwell and had an old friend down 
there who was assigned to plans and he was

28:06.137 --> 28:17.513
absolutely ecstatic. He said, this is the chance 
to prove air power. We're going to save that

28:23.005 --> 28:27.031
peninsula with air power. Somebody, my God, and 
God I don't know who it was, got to Truman with the

28:27.051 --> 28:34.662
same notion. And Truman publicly said, we're 
going to do it with sea and air power. That is

28:41.292 --> 28:44.096
absolute bullshit. You couldn't do it that way. 
You can't do it that way. You'll never be able to do

28:48.904 --> 28:51.207
it that way. Somehow, someway, Truman accepted 
it. That's how the damn thing started, from my

28:55.518 --> 28:58.763
experience. Later on I went out there, but that's 
another part of the question you asked. Well,

29:03.771 --> 29:07.737
later on you went out there in what capacity? 
Again, on a special mission type deal. A special

29:13.707 --> 29:15.049
mission doing what? We had, we were... designing a 
different kind of weapon for a different purpose.

29:23.978 --> 29:41.945
And the problem for the part of San Diego base that I 
was responsible for was to make sure that we had

29:23.978 --> 29:41.945
organized and trained the men who would have to 
take care of that particular weapon for that

29:23.978 --> 29:41.945
particular mission. Okay, they were having a big 
war over there. This is a pretty good place to go

29:45.029 --> 29:47.012
find out. In addition, I had two other missions. 
One was to target to see if the bombs we had would be

29:52.479 --> 30:01.992
of use in that situation. That's as simple as I can 
put the problem. The answer to that was no.

30:09.221 --> 30:10.643
And the other one was a real divvy. The Army wanted a 
shell. You know, they later got one. that would

30:19.612 --> 30:22.415
fire out of a great big cannon, they got that too. 
And to find out from the people who were under the

30:24.398 --> 30:35.911
gun, in other words the army people out there, 
whether that was a good idea, and it wasn't, but we

30:24.398 --> 30:35.911
got it anyway. That's what it was. Why do you say 
that the atomic gun idea is not a good idea? Oh look,

30:41.597 --> 30:47.544
the thing couldn't shoot, I'm not talking about a 
missile, I'm talking about a gun. Yeah, I know.

30:49.362 --> 31:04.878
goddamn thing at best could only shoot 15 miles and 
anybody that's ever been in

30:49.362 --> 31:04.878
a situation in combat, fluid situation, knows 
damn well you can't do it. You can't do that.

31:10.644 --> 31:13.787
Look, let me go one step further on that. They got a 
couple of those things in Europe and One day I was

31:18.910 --> 31:30.324
stationed over there and I had to go into Germany on 
some kind of a long term business. I didn't fly

31:30.864 --> 31:36.752
because I didn't want to leave the airplane over 
there and I didn't, we were tied up so I drove. I

31:38.934 --> 31:42.859
guess I wanted to carve out some personal use, 
something like that. And here's this goddamn

31:43.430 --> 31:50.602
cannon to shoot the thing that was falling from 
here to the road, the street in front, over in the

31:43.430 --> 31:50.602
ditch. Ten days later, when I came back, it was 
still there. Why? They couldn't get it out. You

31:57.453 --> 32:01.139
can't use anything like that in a fluid situation. 
And the men... Just couldn't move it. No. They

32:04.644 --> 32:07.629
wouldn't dare to put the thing where they could use 
it. And the men, the combat... men that I talked to

32:11.037 --> 32:15.402
about it just laughed and they didn't even want to 
talk to me about it. They thought it was so

32:15.422 --> 32:18.285
ridiculous that anyone would have that idea. I 
don't know how you got me off on that subject. I just

32:22.729 --> 32:23.770
asked you about it. Oh, that's not the only stupid 
billion dollar weapon we've got. Now you said

32:29.416 --> 32:37.905
before when we were talking about the Pentagon 
that you took your report from Sandia base out to

32:29.416 --> 32:37.905
the Pentagon when the Korean War started. And then 
you made the comment that I took it to the Pentagon

32:38.898 --> 32:45.845
and they burnt it like they burned a lot of other 
things. Now do they burn your report? Oh yeah,

32:48.568 --> 32:49.169
sure. Is it typical behavior of the Pentagon to 
burn reports instead of file them? Didn't you ever

32:57.618 --> 32:59.140
hear of a burn basket? Let me illustrate that with 
one more personal deal. I had an office far into the

33:08.530 --> 33:09.391
dead end hall. And the scoop was that the material 
that came over from the Atomic Energy Commission

33:10.892 --> 33:29.772
building across the river to my place of business, 
part of it would come on one bridge and part on the

33:10.892 --> 33:29.772
other. And they'd come under the outer office and 
the guy would sign it in to me. He couldn't see it.

33:36.948 --> 33:39.351
and we'd get into my office and we'd put it 
together. I had a young woman secretary and she was

33:40.592 --> 33:43.756
highly comfortable. She was as cleared as I was. 
She wasn't cleared for numbers, but she was

33:46.099 --> 33:51.085
cleared for all she needed to be cleared for. All 
right. My duty was to take this true stuff and build

33:53.468 --> 34:04.542
it into something that could be used in the Air 
Staff without compromising the security of it.

34:09.114 --> 34:16.505
And when we were through with it, we had to go 
through a procedure to burn it. I had a big, big safe

34:17.707 --> 34:23.696
in the office you could walk in. It was a great big 
damn thing and heavy and you couldn't get in it,

34:23.716 --> 34:29.525
except that girl and I. All right, the security 
officer came to me one day, and said that he'd been

34:34.998 --> 34:42.969
asked to account for a paper, which, in his 
records, was in my office. It wasn't.

34:46.974 --> 34:50.819
And I didn't sign for these things. The system was 
different. The poor bastard that was the security

34:54.144 --> 34:56.827
officer signed for them. He didn't even know what I 
did with them.

35:01.554 --> 35:04.077
I told the young lady we had to have it. not to secure 
him, but to get back to the other side of the river,

35:04.715 --> 35:14.306
if necessary, or proof of burn it. There's a way to 
do that, numbers. She didn't know either. And she

35:20.474 --> 35:23.357
said, oh, God damn. And went to the place in this big 
safe where she cut up things for the burn basket.

35:30.666 --> 35:32.308
And she started scratching through it. and found a 
little piece of paper about that big. This sounds

35:36.594 --> 35:38.316
stupid. It's a true story. This was Friday 
afternoon. Okay, it's in there. I wasn't very good

35:46.607 --> 36:02.228
at it, but all day Saturday and all day Sunday, she 
came in and sat on her duff on the floor,

35:46.607 --> 36:02.228
fortunately it was carpeted, and fiddled with 
those goddamn little bitty pieces of paper until

35:46.607 --> 36:02.228
she put them all together, and there is the paper.

36:04.925 --> 36:07.968
So we cleared it. Well, is it common practice for 
the military to be burning official U.S.

36:07.988 --> 36:13.173
government documents? Oh, you have to sometimes. 
Well, as a historian, that's somewhat disturbing

36:17.337 --> 36:20.560
to me. It shouldn't be. They don't burn enough of 
them. Especially now that this law has changed.

36:32.352 --> 36:32.552
Look. This particular study that I mentioned, 
which got us off on this, was a dead issue.

36:48.771 --> 37:02.370
Because this thing that happened in Korea started 
a whole new thing.

37:04.342 --> 37:05.683
I don't want to overdo this.

37:08.907 --> 37:16.755
What I guess I was trying to illustrate is that the 
secrecy was a handicap. Let me illustrate one more

37:18.677 --> 37:21.881
time, twice as a matter of fact. Broder, who wrote 
The Ultimate Weapon, wasn't cleared for all those

37:22.061 --> 37:27.647
things, but nevertheless he's pretty good. Who's 
this now? David Broder, Brody, Broder. Broder?

37:34.279 --> 37:35.180
Yeah. David Broder? Journalist? The journalist, 
David Broder? Yes, yes. Okay, David is Broder. At

37:42.167 --> 37:46.152
that time, he was working, and when I first knew 
him, he was working at the War College. Yeah. And

37:46.292 --> 37:49.115
there's a story about that, but it doesn't fit, so 
I'll tell it. We discussed this without going into

37:50.376 --> 37:53.680
the numbers. He's strongly suspected, but he's 
one pretty smart man and well-informed. That

37:57.684 --> 37:59.526
might be true. people like him. What might be true? 
That we were overproducing.

38:11.847 --> 38:13.549
Overproducing what? Overproducing the 
component of the weapon for its needs. And that

38:21.196 --> 38:24.359
there probably was a better way to go about it. But 
when you get war historia all over The signals of

38:31.163 --> 38:34.050
the ball game changed right then.

38:38.621 --> 38:40.124
I'll tell you one more thing about this. Well, what 
happened to Broder? You were going to tell me about

38:42.009 --> 38:43.111
him. Well, frankly, I don't know. I'd like to know. 
I haven't seen him or heard of him in God knows how

38:46.499 --> 38:48.885
long. No, you were telling me that he got the 
feeling that we were overproducing too many

38:50.401 --> 38:59.632
atomic bombs, and then what happened? The only 
reason I mention him is that this man is a pretty

38:59.712 --> 39:04.158
talented writer. Yeah. And when he came out to 
Sandia with this on his mind, and he had a clearance

39:05.059 --> 39:20.037
for a certain amount of information, I didn't talk 
to him about what I was going to do or had to do, but he

39:05.059 --> 39:20.037
was very helpful because he can write and I can't. I 
can write simple declarative sentences, but I'm

39:20.320 --> 39:28.550
not very good at a long dissertation type thing, 
and he is. I owed him something out of it. So how did

39:32.034 --> 39:33.076
he help you? I don't know whether he knew that I was 
doing it. I don't think he did. I don't know. I don't

39:38.783 --> 39:39.403
think so. I don't think he could have. My boss did 
out there, and he agreed with it. You mean letting

39:45.151 --> 39:46.692
him see documents? Oh, no, I didn't. No, not about 
that. I couldn't. Or telling him about... I'm

39:53.912 --> 39:55.895
talking about secrecy. Uh-huh. No, I couldn't do 
that. Look, I said... But he wanted some

40:03.485 --> 40:04.806
information. There were only 13 people in the 
whole goddamn United States that had the key

40:04.826 --> 40:11.635
information. And I mean by key information was 
without that, Jesus, there are a lot of these

40:16.328 --> 40:19.391
things that you couldn't explain.

40:24.537 --> 40:25.738
This is no longer true. This is long since past. 
Everybody that I know of that needs to know these

40:29.001 --> 40:32.545
things now knows them. Now what was considered the 
key information at that time? How many bombs we

40:36.750 --> 40:38.071
had? That type of information? Or what was it? That 
type of information.

40:44.338 --> 40:45.559
Jesus Christ There were some other features of it 
that had to do with simple technology that it would

40:45.843 --> 40:55.432
be hard to believe could get so screwed up.

40:59.236 --> 40:59.936
We built them.

41:02.719 --> 41:07.624
I don't want to talk about it.

41:07.664 --> 41:10.226
You built a what? The Air Force built some 
equipment that Didn't even fit

41:15.982 --> 41:22.211
what it had to do because of this. This is a story 
that's closed book. It's long since past. It's no

41:28.941 --> 41:29.822
longer true. But let me illustrate it with one more 
story. George Gamow, teller incidentally, if you

41:33.828 --> 41:42.120
don't know, is

41:33.828 --> 41:42.120
a Hungarian. Gamow is a Russian. born and educated 
in Russia. He got out of Russia, and that's a story

41:48.095 --> 41:50.198
in itself. Gamow was not cleared for anything. I 
was in this job in the Pentagon, and we were trying

41:54.504 --> 42:10.247
to establish an archives, as it were, a place where 
the information was that we could put in it, that

41:54.504 --> 42:10.247
people needed to know. That was at 
Wright-Patterson.

42:14.420 --> 42:19.166
This key subject, hell no, you couldn't put that in 
there. You couldn't put it anywhere. But

42:20.868 --> 42:26.935
nevertheless, that which had to do with the 
technology of the weapon system, yes, we could,

42:20.868 --> 42:26.935
and we were doing it. Okay, one morning I showed up 
for work in the Pentagon, and here in my mail was a

42:28.076 --> 42:36.586
dispatch from Wright Patterson. Say, isn't this 
top secret? And I opened it, and it was a little

42:39.510 --> 42:44.055
brochure written by Gamow. You're goddamn right 
it was top secret. He'd written it straight out of

42:49.978 --> 42:51.600
his head. He wasn't cleared for anything. But it 
was just as top secret as anything could be. But as

42:59.647 --> 43:03.190
far as he was concerned at the time, it was a theory 
about how you built the bomb. That illustrates the

43:05.372 --> 43:08.235
difference. You see, the scientists knew goddamn 
well that this wasn't top secret, but other people

43:13.853 --> 43:20.102
didn't, specifically the Congress when they 
passed the first law. When Eisenhower came into

43:22.105 --> 43:35.966
office, not immediately, but within time, he got 
the law changed and it was infinitely better. But

43:35.986 --> 43:40.232
I'm talking about the original Atomic Energy Act 
and the and the secrecy that was written into that

43:40.752 --> 43:43.056
act. One of the things that I think military people 
should be sensitive to, at least I always felt it

43:43.697 --> 43:51.973
should be, is law. Don't give a damn whether you 
agree with it or not, you've got to obey it. If you

43:57.583 --> 44:03.013
find a regulation, then God knows you'll 
proliferate. You can bend or break one of them, but

44:04.529 --> 44:10.034
if it's solidly built on a log, you don't. You've 
got to change the law. That's the nature of

44:13.336 --> 44:16.599
government in the United States. That's what the 
military has to do in order to preserve itself.

44:23.105 --> 44:25.987
It's got to stay out of these things that the 
politicians do. Now tell me about this one trip

44:27.609 --> 44:34.114
that you made to Korea.

44:34.516 --> 44:35.557
Why did you go there? Why did they send you? I wanted 
to go, of course. What was the objective of the

44:40.923 --> 44:42.625
mission? What I stated,

44:43.646 --> 44:50.473
first we had our training mission. Next, what I was 
specifically assigned out of Washington, it had

44:52.516 --> 45:01.165
to do with the bomb and the usefulness of it in that 
situation. And finally that thing that they hung

45:02.005 --> 45:14.512
on to just before I was about to leave was whether or 
not the Army weapon was justified. What did you

45:14.873 --> 45:21.668
think about Douglas MacArthur's idea of using the 
bomb north of the Yalo River?
