00:03.440 --> 00:05.423
Okay, then I've got two questions left. If you 
could make, if you had the financial capability to

00:07.186 --> 00:18.484
make a huge gift, million dollars plus to A&M 
today, for what purpose would you want that gift

00:07.186 --> 00:18.484
used? Theater arts. To do what? Build a building. 
Okay. For the theater arts program.

00:27.799 --> 00:29.582
People are scared of the arts in A&M. They really 
are. Just because they don't understand them, I

00:32.055 --> 00:35.098
think. People don't understand. If it's not Opus, 
then they don't want to see it. Why? Because they

00:38.462 --> 00:39.964
don't trust it necessarily. They think it might be 
bad. They think it might say something that will

00:42.087 --> 00:47.413
disrupt their little utopian society of College 
Station.

00:51.538 --> 01:00.328
They're very talented people at this school, as 
far as theater goes, that don't have the

00:51.538 --> 01:00.328
opportunity to show it because we never get the 
money. I mean, we are underfunded worse than I

01:01.591 --> 01:05.717
think any other department on campus is 
underfunded. Just because theater depends upon

01:06.378 --> 01:08.641
money. You can't do theater without money. And it 
just doesn't work. And it's horrible. Just

01:14.550 --> 01:16.954
because we lose students every semester. We lose 
students to other schools. UT just did away with

01:18.556 --> 01:20.659
their undergraduate theater program. What are we 
going to do? What's A&M going to do? If they're

01:23.524 --> 01:25.827
serious about Vision 2020... I mean, I could go on 
for this about 30 minutes, but. Okay. All right,

01:30.627 --> 01:36.793
the last question then is, what feelings do you 
carry in your heart about Texas A&M?

01:39.636 --> 01:40.517
Eternal gratitude. Eternal gratitude. A&M has 
shaped me into the person that I am. If I would have

01:48.024 --> 01:49.986
gone to a different school, I would not be like 
this. I just would not.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.431
I don't think any one of my friends would be. I mean, 
I'm eternally grateful in everything. It's

01:58.714 --> 02:03.122
taught me to give in ways in which I never thought I 
would be capable of giving. It's taught me to serve

02:03.622 --> 02:05.546
in ways that I never thought I would. It's given me 
the best friends of my life. I think other places

02:08.130 --> 02:10.313
will do that, but it just seems different here. And 
I can't tell you why. Like, my brother went to

02:12.116 --> 02:15.422
University of Virginia, like I said, and he 
doesn't have the friendships that I have. He just

02:16.223 --> 02:16.764
doesn't. Just because at other schools, It's 
very, I don't want to say selfish, but it's very,

02:20.836 --> 02:26.403
okay, what can this do for me? At A&M it's not like 
that. Of course that's always in somewhere, but

02:27.965 --> 02:31.449
it's never the driving force. It's always what can 
this do for A&M and what can I get out of it and turn of

02:32.550 --> 02:35.594
it. People give here unlike I've ever seen before. 
My parents tell me that all the time. They're like,

02:40.861 --> 02:45.406
Ricky, we don't understand what it is, but people 
just give at A&M. They just do.
