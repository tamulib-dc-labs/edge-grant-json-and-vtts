00:02.309 --> 00:05.959
the first and second semester that drank a whole lot, that's why.

00:05.979 --> 00:12.999
It was more of the camaraderie type thing and a lot of it was, it became interesting.

00:13.099 --> 00:17.010
We would, I do remember this, we'd start off complaining about what went wrong

00:17.497 --> 00:24.784
in the outfit that week who we weren't going to act like when we were sophomores, who we weren't going to act like when we were juniors.

00:25.164 --> 00:25.845
Total reversal.

00:25.885 --> 00:27.747
Sophomore, we weren't going to be near that mean.

00:28.387 --> 00:32.992
Junior, there's no way we're going to have as like today's gladitude as some of them had.

00:34.473 --> 00:36.675
We thought the seniors hung the moon.

00:37.076 --> 00:39.198
Small senior class, but really neat guys.

00:40.199 --> 00:42.401
And then we talked about what we were going to do the next week.

00:42.421 --> 00:46.845
So it was all, again, it was really, there was a really tight focus on the outfit

00:47.264 --> 00:47.604
Right.

00:47.624 --> 00:50.368
Now, meanwhile, you're not going to class as often as you should.

00:50.388 --> 00:50.728
Yep.

00:50.748 --> 00:54.533
My grades aren't doing as well as they should or it's not sinking in or something's not working.

00:54.553 --> 00:56.976
And your grades go home to your folks.

00:57.837 --> 00:57.977
Mm-hmm.

00:57.997 --> 01:01.081
And what's their reaction?

01:01.101 --> 01:03.003
My parents would probably die if they heard this.

01:04.825 --> 01:08.209
My next brother got all the encouragement in the world about GPs.

01:08.309 --> 01:08.670
I didn't.

01:08.710 --> 01:09.871
I was the oldest.

01:09.891 --> 01:12.755
And they just kind of let me do my own thing.

01:13.015 --> 01:14.537
And, I mean, there was nothing that ever...

01:14.872 --> 01:19.999
I mean, dad would talk every once in a while that, you know, I might end up in an oil field if I don't get a job right.

01:20.059 --> 01:20.640
All right.

01:20.660 --> 01:24.886
That first semester, as far as you recall, how often did you communicate with mom and dad?

01:26.428 --> 01:27.510
Letters, phone calls?

01:28.972 --> 01:30.294
I wasn't a very good letter writer.

01:32.357 --> 01:35.060
Probably a phone call a week and not a lot.

01:35.401 --> 01:36.663
And about how often did you go home?

01:37.584 --> 01:38.605
Oh, not much at all.

01:38.645 --> 01:42.291
Maybe three times, four times max.

01:42.551 --> 01:42.651
Okay.

01:42.715 --> 01:45.119
I loved what I was doing, and that was fun.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.481
I mean, I liked being at A&M.

01:46.501 --> 01:47.542
I liked the core part of it.

01:47.663 --> 01:51.148
Didn't like the grades as much, struggled with that, but loved the core.

01:51.168 --> 01:54.573
Now, that first semester, remember how academically, how many?

01:54.633 --> 01:55.014
1.9.

01:55.034 --> 01:57.438
All right, and what course, how many?

01:58.239 --> 02:00.763
And that's on a four-point, as we know that?

02:00.783 --> 02:00.963
Oh, yeah.

02:00.983 --> 02:02.345
All right, how many hours were you taking?

02:03.126 --> 02:05.590
I think I had 15 or 16 at that time.

02:05.610 --> 02:06.732
Did you flunk anything?

02:07.454 --> 02:10.899
No, I don't think I had an N, but I had lots of C's and D's.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.701
And you were officially, you were?

02:12.721 --> 02:13.602
I had a B in military science.

02:14.383 --> 02:15.885
Officially you were majoring in?

02:16.446 --> 02:18.649
I think it was poli-sci at that time.

02:18.669 --> 02:24.897
I think it was poli-sci and then I switched to sociology and then I switched to history and then I switched to anthropology.

02:24.917 --> 02:25.598
Okay.

02:25.618 --> 02:29.022
The, uh, uh.

02:29.283 --> 02:33.428
Haskell's now already, why am I sitting here interviewing this guy?

02:34.235 --> 02:36.138
A court trip that fall?

02:36.158 --> 02:36.618
Oh, yeah.

02:36.879 --> 02:38.421
Fort Worth, Warren's house.

02:39.262 --> 02:40.864
We did two court trips.

02:40.884 --> 02:42.085
Fort Worth was one.

02:43.547 --> 02:45.129
Didn't we do Austin that year or two?

02:45.149 --> 02:46.291
So we went to TCU.

02:46.792 --> 02:50.016
I think we went to Austin, but I remember TCU because it was our first one.

02:51.838 --> 02:52.539
How'd you get up there?

02:53.140 --> 02:55.483
I had just got, that's when I brought up my bug.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.167
It was late in the semester.

02:58.227 --> 03:01.711
I was able, I think at the midway point, they let us bring cars on campus.

03:01.792 --> 03:02.513
My parents did.

03:02.533 --> 03:03.634
So I brought the VW.

03:04.711 --> 03:08.801
We had, there were five of us that piled into that, drove it up to Warren Russell's house.

03:08.902 --> 03:12.350
He lived about a block and a half from TCU Stadium.

03:12.370 --> 03:16.019
And we all, there were 13 of us, or 12 of us, we all piled into his house.

03:16.461 --> 03:18.265
His mom was a real delight.

03:18.650 --> 03:23.775
I remember we went out and tried to soak their fountains the night before.

03:23.815 --> 03:26.978
There were some other things that we were thinking of doing, but they were garden things.

03:26.998 --> 03:34.445
And so we ended up trying to find some places to meet some TCU girls who had absolutely no desire to meet clean shaven Aggies.

03:35.406 --> 03:37.568
And so we ended up back at Warren's place.

03:38.229 --> 03:42.332
His mom fixed incredible meals, I remember that.

03:43.113 --> 03:46.176
And we were up bright and early shining, marching,

03:47.067 --> 03:55.029
Obviously did well in the march in and the game, we walked to the game which was kind of fun.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.516
Back to school on the same morning.

03:58.407 --> 04:02.673
Then you spent the night, Saturday night up there.

04:03.014 --> 04:04.015
Friday and Saturday night.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.357
Then came back early Sunday.

04:06.719 --> 04:09.624
Because we had to get back to get rooms ready for inspection Monday.

04:09.744 --> 04:14.571
So it always took us three to four hours on a Sunday afternoon to get the rooms shipped straight.

04:14.591 --> 04:14.711
Right.

04:15.092 --> 04:27.891
In four years of core trips, do you remember any negative reaction by the people during the parade or anything like that?

04:28.310 --> 04:29.272
And this was during Nob.

04:29.793 --> 04:43.096
I mean, my class, when we graduated class of 75 officers, they were very, I think I read that was the smallest group of commissioned officers of any year since World War II, up to now.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.543
I mean, it was, no, but we had no problems.

04:46.763 --> 04:50.149
Even when we went to that place in Austin, we didn't have any problems.

04:50.129 --> 04:53.973
Okay, then you go home Christmas.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.417
Any mind changing yet?

04:57.437 --> 04:59.419
You didn't ask about bonfire, my fish here.

04:59.439 --> 05:00.280
Oh, oh, oh, yes.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.681
Oh, bonfire, yes.

05:03.123 --> 05:03.343
Yeah.

05:03.723 --> 05:10.350
I had banged my knee up in baseball in Tomball, Texas the summer before.

05:10.390 --> 05:19.900
So I didn't work on bonfire very much at all because my knee was swollen and I was going to go in for knee surgery at Christmas.

05:21.061 --> 05:27.811
The person that turned out to be my junior and senior old lady had his leg broken.

05:27.831 --> 05:30.035
Compound double fracture.

05:30.055 --> 05:30.696
In the cut.

05:31.937 --> 05:32.198
How?

05:33.460 --> 05:36.384
I was in the cut area that day.

05:37.085 --> 05:41.392
As I understand it, because I remember what happened after that.

05:41.412 --> 05:48.182
As I understand that one of the commands, and there's still question whether it was

05:48.601 --> 05:51.908
The junior or the sophomore, I think it was the sophomore, issued it.

05:52.470 --> 06:01.751
But the front half heaved and the back half dropped and John was standing in the middle and he had a compound fracture that came through and they took him down to Herman.

06:01.831 --> 06:08.145
So my recollection of bonfire my fish here was guys coming back in crying.

06:08.429 --> 06:14.297
and we all piled into cars and went down to Herman.

06:14.818 --> 06:17.101
Couldn't see John except for very briefly.

06:17.341 --> 06:21.207
We ate in an all night hunter and drove back.

06:21.327 --> 06:27.055
I remember Bill White just being in an absolute state of shock and Mike Thompson I think was the same way.

06:27.315 --> 06:30.960
They probably thought that the outfit was going to get some real problems at that time.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.249
And everybody was worried about John.

06:34.650 --> 06:36.395
We didn't know if John would walk again.

06:36.455 --> 06:38.360
That's what they were saying at that time.

06:40.385 --> 06:41.608
And so it was,

06:42.314 --> 06:46.300
You know, I remember the blaze, I remember all the other things, but that was my memory.

06:46.661 --> 06:49.785
About how long did folks work on Bonfire then?

06:49.945 --> 06:52.449
Oh, gosh, we were starting in the cut early on.

06:52.589 --> 07:00.942
I mean, memory's hazy, because it's been, you know, a quarter of a century, but it was, I think we were in the cut areas in October.

07:01.944 --> 07:03.105
Okay.

07:03.165 --> 07:04.147
You're saying a good month.

07:04.227 --> 07:06.190
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

07:06.310 --> 07:10.937
And it was built, you know, behind Duncan at that time, so we had guys going out now.

07:11.221 --> 07:16.509
They wouldn't let us go out and work on the stack and the EMEs or even guard if our grades weren't going.

07:16.529 --> 07:19.674
So I was already being limited what I could do because my GPs weren't there.

07:19.935 --> 07:20.736
Now, and it was one?

07:20.796 --> 07:23.500
No, I think we were cake at that time.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.804
It was several layers, yeah.

07:25.944 --> 07:35.659
And, you know, sometimes I'd love to go back, now that I'm into history as much, and look at the sizes because they all, you know, grow with the years.

07:35.791 --> 07:42.241
But I think we had our fish here, we were saying it was at that 90, 100-foot level, so it was a pretty tall one.

07:42.741 --> 07:49.832
And it was a fish log that broke John's leg, so it was the biggest log they were trying to carry out.

07:50.573 --> 07:59.246
And I remember very clearly that we knew that log was on the fire because we carved it in memory of John and put it on the stack.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.811
Now, as far as you know, how did his leg come out?

08:03.095 --> 08:04.697
I still stay in touch with John.

08:04.717 --> 08:08.801
John and I talk a lot.

08:08.941 --> 08:12.265
It's been tough on John, but I don't think it's Bonfair related.

08:12.886 --> 08:14.848
No, but I mean he's been able to walk and all that.

08:15.008 --> 08:20.014
He ultimately had pins put in his hip and his knee area.

08:20.895 --> 08:22.937
He's got a long rod down it.

08:24.318 --> 08:25.800
It still bothers him a great deal.

08:25.860 --> 08:30.385
He goes into the orthopedist often on every couple of months.

08:30.871 --> 08:34.797
Weather changes are absolutely brutal on him.

08:34.857 --> 08:37.340
It's literally a pin that goes from his hip to his knee.

08:39.323 --> 08:43.749
He was never supposed to walk, but he was jogging our sophomore year.

08:45.291 --> 08:50.719
He would make most of a run out to Easterwood at a fast type of jog.

08:51.139 --> 08:53.503
And he's even jogging in the last couple of years.

08:53.563 --> 08:58.009
That's, I think, the only way that he's been able to keep that leg going.

08:58.310 --> 09:01.055
Did A&M help to pay any of the medical expenses?

09:01.075 --> 09:01.418
I don't think so.

09:02.360 --> 09:10.627
I think it was one of those things, out of sight, out of mind, we just won't deal with it, and I'm not sure how much it ever even got outside of the core area.

09:11.068 --> 09:19.135
It was one of, it was an accident that happened in the cut area, but everybody said it was an accident, and nobody drew a lot of attention to it.

09:19.576 --> 09:23.319
John changed a lot after that, but outside of that, there wasn't anything else.

09:23.339 --> 09:32.367
Right, as you recall, the four years of Bonfire when you were a student, are there some things that you recall that obviously were

09:32.347 --> 09:33.590
should not have happened?

09:34.512 --> 09:35.575
No.

09:35.796 --> 09:39.204
You know, I went in the cut area the day that John still happened.

09:40.447 --> 09:46.442
The other times that I was there, either in cut or in junior and senior, I was out at the stacks, nothing.

09:47.926 --> 09:49.309
There was a

09:50.065 --> 10:00.305
You would find on the periphery the wannabe types would be doing some drinking, but the other people that were there, particularly Red Pots and people that were on the stacks, it was pretty straight-laced.

10:00.325 --> 10:03.632
It was real focused on what you could and couldn't do.

10:03.652 --> 10:10.926
After John's accident, I know that our sophomore year, when we were in charge of the cuts, we were really...

10:11.159 --> 10:14.691
grilled pretty harsh on what we could and couldn't do and how to do it.

10:15.294 --> 10:16.899
A lot more supervision that year.

10:16.939 --> 10:22.840
I don't know if it was a result of John or I think it was just the overall tightening up of what was going on at that stage of the game.

10:23.765 --> 10:29.931
And let's see, did we win the, we didn't win the game that year.

10:30.371 --> 10:32.393
I think we were 1-10 that year.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.535
And Gene Stallings departed.

10:34.575 --> 10:41.581
The, you go home Christmas.

10:41.761 --> 10:42.542
Right.

10:42.562 --> 10:44.824
And go right into surgery before Christmas.

10:44.964 --> 10:46.285
Had my knee operated on.

10:46.305 --> 10:46.466
Oh wow.

10:47.306 --> 10:53.552
And which was devastating because when I came out, whether it was real or not, or mental,

10:54.629 --> 10:57.012
it appeared that I wouldn't be able to be airborne and Ranger.

10:57.312 --> 11:01.097
And so I was starting to get concerned about what I was going to do with the military now.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.441
But yeah, I came back on crutches.

11:04.781 --> 11:06.684
And this is an interesting thing in my life.

11:06.704 --> 11:08.526
I mean, I did a lot of growing up at A&M.

11:10.268 --> 11:15.895
Because of the focus and the intensity,

11:17.039 --> 11:24.526
Of that first semester, I actually got out the first two weeks, maybe even three weeks of my second semester and was a non-reg.

11:25.688 --> 11:27.349
And then I went back to the Corps.

11:28.090 --> 11:31.153
And I think it was actually only about a week or two out.

11:31.173 --> 11:34.016
And obviously, it was even worse than going back.

11:34.056 --> 11:35.377
But it all turned out fine.

11:35.477 --> 11:39.842
But yeah, I was in Davis-Gurie for two weeks and then went back to the Corps.

11:40.242 --> 11:43.165
And it was something that I really missed.

11:43.465 --> 11:46.168
And I figured maybe there's a way I can get my grades worked on.

11:46.621 --> 11:53.678
All right, now that spring semester, your first year, you don't really make many changes in your study habits?

11:54.179 --> 11:57.788
I go to school, I go to class a lot more, but it's not hitting.

11:57.948 --> 12:04.123
I'm not getting the study time, and I hadn't found a library yet, and hadn't found some quiet places in the sea.

12:04.103 --> 12:10.940
The person that really changed my outlook on grades actually happened my second semester, sophomore year.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.805
So I was still struggling with what it was being.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.950
And I didn't ask for help.

12:15.532 --> 12:18.720
You didn't ask for help on anything.

12:19.021 --> 12:24.889
And that was kind of the mode, I don't know about it, in the rest of the court, but in our outfit, you didn't ask.

12:25.530 --> 12:27.473
So I was struggling on how to be a student.

12:27.593 --> 12:29.555
And so that goes the whole spring semester.

12:29.575 --> 12:30.316
Oh, yeah.

12:30.337 --> 12:35.043
All right, then you didn't go anywhere spring break unusual.

12:37.426 --> 12:40.651
What about going through final review the first time?

12:40.671 --> 12:43.615
Oh, but the end of Parents' Day was the time.

12:44.456 --> 12:44.556
Okay.

12:45.194 --> 12:49.224
Now, you probably haven't figured out why the intensity.

12:50.507 --> 12:55.439
We went from 40th in the Corps to Outstanding Unit at Parents' Day.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.301
Oh, boy.

12:56.551 --> 12:58.353
We got General Moore that year.

12:58.373 --> 12:59.935
Oh.

13:00.235 --> 13:01.837
Did y'all know in advance you were going to win?

13:01.857 --> 13:02.678
We knew a week out.

13:03.178 --> 13:04.680
We didn't know we'd won it.

13:04.840 --> 13:10.507
We understood what all the force was and why the attention and why the new attention on grades.

13:11.348 --> 13:13.009
Because my class was dragging them down.

13:13.070 --> 13:15.813
So we got an outstanding unit.

13:17.875 --> 13:22.440
We had an interesting time the weekend before

13:23.112 --> 13:27.698
Parents' Day, we got an idea that it might be worth having all of our parents come up.

13:27.738 --> 13:29.520
We were going to be in contention for some stuff.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.042
Didn't know if we were going to get the award.

13:32.143 --> 13:34.366
Remember they had three cranes that year up.

13:34.766 --> 13:36.449
They had one on top of Oceanography.

13:36.909 --> 13:38.131
They had one on top of Rudder.

13:38.511 --> 13:40.794
They had one on top of Harrington.

13:40.814 --> 13:48.183
Just magically, D-275 appeared at the end of each one of those cranes.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.445
There were four of us that did that.

13:49.785 --> 13:50.486
How did you all do that?

13:50.526 --> 13:51.347
Describe that.

13:52.812 --> 13:55.615
Oceanography was the one I remember because it was the highest.

13:55.835 --> 14:00.440
I mean, literally climbing up the oceanography stairs and then climbing up the crane.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.084
I got up to the arm on the crane.

14:04.505 --> 14:12.293
One of the other guys, who had been our CEO, Don Boyd, got all the way out and painted on all three of them, D275.

14:13.454 --> 14:17.098
And we did it after a Rare Earth concert.

14:17.348 --> 14:21.074
and Rare Earth was a hard rock band, and everybody was country in the core but us.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.376
We were the hard rock guys.

14:22.396 --> 14:29.927
And so here we were dancing in heaven, or not dancing, but really enjoying the concert.

14:30.267 --> 14:33.973
It was the Friday night before Parents' Day the next day.

14:34.375 --> 14:37.619
And so that night we were looking for something to do and four of us went out to do it.

14:37.639 --> 14:39.241
Now this is the spring of 72.

14:39.261 --> 14:39.882
Yeah.

14:40.162 --> 14:41.323
Your fresh year.

14:41.364 --> 14:41.864
April 72.

14:41.924 --> 14:42.585
Okay.

14:43.686 --> 14:45.489
And then we won the court the next day.

14:45.509 --> 14:48.432
And you paint with, is it paint?

14:48.512 --> 14:48.893
White paint.

14:49.133 --> 14:50.615
White paint, big letters.

14:51.476 --> 14:51.916
D-2-75.

14:52.557 --> 14:54.459
Whose idea was it?

14:54.560 --> 14:57.363
Actually all of us bought into it, but it's really Don Boyd.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.384
Call him wild man.

14:58.685 --> 15:00.687
And we wanted to leave a statement of,

15:00.667 --> 15:07.075
We knew that we had a shot at getting this outstanding unit, so we figured, you were the fish that did it, let's make a statement.

15:07.095 --> 15:08.056
And so we went out on the cranes.

15:08.557 --> 15:10.259
And nobody got caught.

15:10.379 --> 15:10.539
No.

15:11.120 --> 15:11.801
And nobody fell.

15:12.362 --> 15:15.025
Yeah.

15:15.045 --> 15:16.807
And obviously there was no guard.

15:17.188 --> 15:17.348
No.

15:18.389 --> 15:19.951
On any of it.

15:19.971 --> 15:20.112
No.

15:20.332 --> 15:22.174
Which one did you do first?

15:22.655 --> 15:23.296
Oceanography.

15:23.316 --> 15:24.197
The others were easy.

15:25.619 --> 15:28.242
Oceanography was the tough one.

15:28.262 --> 15:28.362
Okay.

15:29.067 --> 15:30.890
And we did them all that night.

15:31.771 --> 15:32.433
About what time?

15:33.334 --> 15:34.255
Oh, it was late.

15:34.276 --> 15:41.067
I mean, we were barely awake when we fell out for Parents' Day, Saturday for the first ceremony.

15:41.147 --> 15:43.811
So it was one, two, three, four in the morning.

15:44.152 --> 15:48.038
What was the reaction when that was discovered?

15:48.203 --> 15:51.729
Well, see, we won the court the next day, so we thought that would mute it.

15:51.809 --> 15:52.250
It didn't.

15:52.310 --> 15:57.458
And so we had some really, really intense physical training the next week.

15:57.739 --> 16:02.286
I mean, it was, you know, there was no sophomore privileges being handed down.

16:02.386 --> 16:12.743
You were lots of raincoats in the showers and sauna doing push-ups and sit-ups and lots of other stuff going on that was...

16:13.010 --> 16:22.024
We did a couple of really early morning runs out to Easterwood, and we ended up doing PT in that ditch behind President Williams' house early in the morning and stuff like that.

16:22.244 --> 16:26.270
But no real effort to find who the perpetrators were?

16:26.290 --> 16:34.262
No, they tried to, and we were pretty much fish, and we all stuck together back then, and that's why we all suffered as a fish class to the extent of the PT stuff.

16:34.623 --> 16:42.274
But there was nobody from outside the, I mean, I'm sure the outfit was getting pressured, but we were only fish, I mean, and so we were, I mean,

16:42.862 --> 16:48.327
They did the typical stuff, no mouthwash, no deodorant, you can't shave, I mean, you can't shower and all that kind of stuff.

16:49.088 --> 16:54.213
So we retaliated, we ate garlic, and Ed, bless his heart, had a bad dental problem, so it got even worse.

16:54.273 --> 17:00.979
But they never did find out, they may have guessed who it was, but they never did find out who the four were.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.203
About how long did that, did those signs remain up there?

17:04.963 --> 17:05.784
How long before they?

17:06.124 --> 17:08.267
I don't remember, I just remember the immediate effect.

17:08.687 --> 17:11.890
I don't know if they were painted over the next day or not, but it was white paint.

17:12.494 --> 17:17.903
All right, then at final review, did anybody from your family come up?

17:18.064 --> 17:18.905
Yeah, family did.

17:19.166 --> 17:27.119
My family was really good about coming up to the military type stuff, to the events and that kind of stuff, because I think that's what got my two brothers energized.

17:27.260 --> 17:31.868
And my girlfriend at that time was up there and that kind of stuff.

17:31.948 --> 17:33.270
But it was all...

17:33.740 --> 17:38.466
I was going to stay at my sophomore, my freshman sophomore.

17:38.486 --> 17:39.147
No, I wouldn't.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.068
I was going to be the next year.

17:41.350 --> 17:48.219
So, no, there wasn't anything spectacular except that we got to become sophomores and we'd do back next year to break out our vengeance.

17:48.239 --> 17:52.325
And how did you feel when you put on that sophomore regalia?

17:53.186 --> 17:55.629
King.

17:55.649 --> 17:56.490
We were on top of the world.

17:57.466 --> 18:04.115
I mean, we take, I mean, what had been pushed into us was we were the best, and we found out we actually were the best.

18:05.276 --> 18:12.846
And, you know, at that time, 50% or more was GPs, so we were fortunate to have people in the outfit making GPs.

18:12.906 --> 18:15.390
I was one of the few that really was struggling.

18:16.111 --> 18:18.734
All right, and your grades that second semester?

18:19.235 --> 18:19.996
Not much improvement.

18:20.136 --> 18:21.137
I mean, they were about the same.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.219
Still struggling.

18:22.239 --> 18:23.140
Hadn't learned how to study.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.722
And what'd you do that summer?

18:25.411 --> 18:27.854
Worked at two jobs.

18:28.134 --> 18:34.762
One was my fourth summer at Astroworld as a fry cook, running a restaurant there, and then started that.

18:35.303 --> 18:37.546
And then ended up working offshore Louisiana.

18:38.066 --> 18:40.870
And that's where I spent most of my time going offshore.

18:41.631 --> 18:47.118
When that came up, I think that was Dad's way of saying, if I don't get a degree, this is what my future held.

18:47.999 --> 18:50.001
Interesting enough, I got actually drafted.

18:50.453 --> 18:55.058
at a low number that summer because I'd lost my deferment when I got out of the Corps for those two weeks.

18:55.658 --> 18:58.281
And so by the time I got back, they'd gotten it squared away.

18:58.661 --> 19:00.924
But that would not have been the summer to have been drafted.

19:02.485 --> 19:06.730
And then you come back for your second year.

19:06.810 --> 19:11.615
Had you yet changed any routine or determination?

19:12.475 --> 19:16.039
More focus, but in grades to some extent.

19:16.930 --> 19:22.558
I actually, I've been really fortunate to come up with some neat ideas and then get people to do it.

19:22.578 --> 19:29.027
I started an idea, and then we ended up getting about 12 of us to organize it, and then one thing led to another.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.910
We did what was called Operation Pegasus.

19:31.932 --> 19:41.766
That was a sophomore class in the Corps, ran from Bonfire, circled Memorial Stadium, and ended up in Eastwood Park in Austin for our own Yale practice.

19:42.988 --> 19:45.992
And... Wait, ran from Bonfire?

19:46.327 --> 19:46.648
Here?

19:47.329 --> 19:49.434
My sophomore year, you betcha.

19:49.775 --> 19:52.360
We got a big white banner that we carried.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.289
It was in a, you know, it was a horizontal banner, Operation Pegasus.

19:57.211 --> 20:00.458
It was white with gold frill, red letters, just like the Moore flag.

20:00.478 --> 20:02.242
And I carried the Moore flag my sophomore year.

20:02.322 --> 20:03.745
No, not Pegasus.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.735
It was just the name I came up with.

20:05.775 --> 20:11.863
I was in the Greek mythology back then and Pegasus was strong and that was it.

20:12.603 --> 20:14.866
We had some future key student leaders.

20:14.886 --> 20:16.628
Steve Everhard was real active in that.

20:17.269 --> 20:24.939
But we had, we made a pitch to all of the sophomores got reps from all the units and made a pitch.

20:25.820 --> 20:31.707
And each unit took a three mile stretch and they were responsible for two mile and a half legs.

20:32.092 --> 20:42.401
and a guy named Stu Rayfield ended up running communications, and we had Vane, we had DPS sign off, and that's where I got on real good terms with Dean Hannigan, because he got us to all the right people.

20:42.421 --> 20:54.531
We went to DPS and had to get insurance, and we actually marked in highway paint, got okayed by the transportation department to mark staging areas all down the deal, so it was fairly intense.

20:55.112 --> 21:01.137
So my grades really weren't going great that semester either, but we sure had one heck of an organization and run.

21:01.157 --> 21:02.098
That took how long?

21:02.804 --> 21:04.166
from the time left here?

21:04.406 --> 21:05.288
We left Bonfire.

21:05.368 --> 21:18.968
We actually slowed up outside of Manor for a while and then got into Austin and Burl Summerall, who was a Marine at that time in one of the Marine units, his dad's a former mayor of Austin or a stepfather, so we had escort through Austin.

21:19.749 --> 21:24.456
And we got there probably in the morning about 10 o'clock, 10.30, had TV coverage.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.059
You're saying in?

21:26.079 --> 21:26.820
Saturday morning.

21:28.572 --> 21:30.975
Or not Saturday, Friday morning I guess.

21:31.035 --> 21:33.418
So you're saying 18 hours or something like that.

21:33.438 --> 21:35.160
And the game was then?

21:37.102 --> 21:39.345
Was it that afternoon or the next day?

21:39.385 --> 21:40.326
I think it was the next day.

21:41.688 --> 21:43.550
And no problems, no accidents?

21:43.810 --> 21:44.531
No, no.

21:44.631 --> 21:51.399
In fact, we had to have DPS sign off and they had radio come with us the whole way.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.702
A lot of it through the Trigon.

21:53.682 --> 21:58.737
We had every community we went through, we had to have the police sign off on it.

21:58.757 --> 22:01.064
We had to know where the closest medical area was.

22:01.104 --> 22:03.571
I mean, it was a true, well done organization.

22:03.852 --> 22:05.717
About how many people were running

22:06.659 --> 22:19.434
We asked for just a couple of representatives because we were staging in 10-mile grips, so we'd get everybody into a 10-mile, put everybody on trucks with flatbeds and then stage them out across there at night with lights and all that kind of stuff.

22:20.756 --> 22:25.522
Ended up, most of each class in each outfit ran, and every outfit had somebody in there.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.063
I know in our outfit everybody did.

22:29.006 --> 22:29.867
It was all core?

22:30.287 --> 22:30.868
All core.

22:31.969 --> 22:35.113
I know that the flag ultimately went to the

22:35.920 --> 22:56.646
uh... uh... athlete uh... athletic departments i never heard what happened yet but me it was a thing that when we got to march in uh... for uh... at ut uh... everybody was going you guys have got it made i was the organizer and they would go everywhere you're on course day

22:57.200 --> 23:04.129
And that was the best of my life at that time, and it was the worst because all of a sudden I realized I didn't have the GPs.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.252
I wasn't going to get a core staff.

23:06.272 --> 23:07.414
I wasn't going to get an RV.

23:07.975 --> 23:14.003
I wasn't going to do all these things that I really, really wanted to do because I lacked one thing.

23:15.805 --> 23:16.887
All right, what turned that around?

23:18.589 --> 23:21.974
Basketball game against Boater University in Jolly Raleigh.

23:22.595 --> 23:24.237
Louie Goert and I,

23:24.773 --> 23:35.484
and a guy named Tom Moore, who was in B2, went to the game on a lark and were sitting in the stands and there were two just really cute girls in front of us that were Baylor grads.

23:37.005 --> 23:40.889
Turns out that both of them were in Air Force ROTC at Baylor.

23:41.370 --> 23:43.452
We started, Tom and I started dating them.

23:44.693 --> 23:53.582
I got dumped three quarters of the way through it, but I spent every weekend, if I wanted a date, I had to be up there and we studied and we studied.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.465
And Debbie taught me how to study in a library.

23:56.605 --> 23:57.928
She taught me how to take notes.

23:58.869 --> 24:00.432
And I turned around.

24:00.492 --> 24:03.598
I think I had a 2-9 or borderline 3 of that semester.

24:03.658 --> 24:05.722
So my grades really spiked up.

24:06.243 --> 24:08.206
And I got into anthropology.

24:08.226 --> 24:09.889
And so then everything started to click.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.172
And I ended up getting to grad school.

24:11.192 --> 24:12.494
But I mean, it was really tough.

24:12.514 --> 24:13.456
Why anthropology?

24:13.476 --> 24:14.237
Do you know?

24:15.533 --> 24:21.404
What I loved about Pegasus was it was working with people and organizing things and doing things that people said you can't do.

24:22.266 --> 24:25.011
And why would you want to spend your time doing that?

24:25.031 --> 24:30.201
And we raised money for the March of Dimes back then as well.

24:30.772 --> 24:40.022
When I got into Anthro, it was all about people and cultures and how organizations, different kinds of thinking of organizations, how they work.

24:40.042 --> 24:40.923
So I just fell in love.

24:41.263 --> 24:43.226
And Vaughn's a spectacular lecture.

24:43.246 --> 24:46.149
I mean, I fell in love listening to his lectures.

24:47.290 --> 24:49.633
I mean, I was ace in the courses.

24:50.093 --> 24:52.356
Did you begin to seek his advice and counsel?

24:52.876 --> 24:56.340
Started to talk to him, started to go on digs, got into the archaeology stuff.

24:56.658 --> 25:02.017
It's really funny because I was a kid in uniform and everybody else had long hair and it was here in Vietnam.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.727
But yeah, started going digs, loved it.

25:04.943 --> 25:07.386
Where were some of the interesting digs y'all made?

25:07.426 --> 25:09.829
The fun, there were two that came to mind.

25:10.570 --> 25:16.698
Black Palestine had dropped some, and we were out there, some pod hunters had found some area.

25:16.718 --> 25:16.838
Where?

25:16.858 --> 25:20.282
Yeah, Black Palestine, or Palestine out here in East Texas.

25:20.302 --> 25:20.883
Palestine.

25:21.163 --> 25:29.874
And I unearthed, it was funny, because that semester I was a work-study student in the archaeology lab, so on the dig I unearthed a glob of clay.

25:30.495 --> 25:33.499
In the lab I pieced back together a clay pipe that had

25:35.690 --> 25:36.752
I thought that was the coolest thing.

25:37.934 --> 25:41.661
After my senior year, because I was a five-year senior, I had to pick up language at the end.

25:43.303 --> 25:52.420
Kathy and I got married, had a two-day honeymoon in San Antonio, came back, took finals, and we were on a dig at Lake Conroe.

25:53.041 --> 25:55.545
And so those are the two digs that stand out.

25:55.565 --> 25:57.208
A lot of archaeology lab work done.

25:57.644 --> 26:02.770
All right, that sophomore year, you was important to change.

26:04.051 --> 26:08.677
Did, were there some other acquaintances that you made that now you realize are important?

26:10.118 --> 26:11.920
Steve was one.

26:11.940 --> 26:12.541
Steve Reberhardt?

26:12.641 --> 26:13.922
Yeah.

26:14.203 --> 26:16.585
And a lot of the guys that went on course staff, we started to hang around.

26:16.646 --> 26:18.968
I was kind of the guy that didn't get there in some ways.

26:20.109 --> 26:22.732
There was starting to be an emphasis on extracurricular activities.

26:22.813 --> 26:24.755
I wasn't involved outside the outfit.

26:24.855 --> 26:26.757
I didn't get first sergeant.

26:27.226 --> 26:31.079
I carried the flag and came number two for first sergeant in our outfit.

26:33.869 --> 26:34.772
We won more again.

26:35.374 --> 26:38.164
So now we've won outstanding unit two years in a row.

26:38.650 --> 26:42.314
And if you look at John Adams' book, we're one of only two that did it three years in a row.

26:43.375 --> 26:46.318
Now you start, you're going to class regularly.

26:46.538 --> 26:47.058
Absolutely.

26:47.178 --> 26:52.163
Taking notes, going to the library, and starting to get energized by anthropology.

26:53.645 --> 26:59.250
Stayed up here that summer, recruited for incoming freshmen in the D2.

26:59.350 --> 27:00.972
We made an art out of it.

27:00.992 --> 27:02.033
Were you employed?

27:03.134 --> 27:03.935
Yeah.

27:04.075 --> 27:05.176
No, that summer I wasn't.

27:05.256 --> 27:06.317
The other summers I was.

27:06.517 --> 27:07.138
Did what?

27:07.962 --> 27:10.324
I was doing it to get my GPs up.

27:10.584 --> 27:12.006
Oh, you took some courses that summer.

27:12.026 --> 27:12.206
Oh, okay.

27:12.526 --> 27:18.451
And so I stayed up here, took courses, got some GPs, and we were recruiting fish into D2.

27:19.292 --> 27:21.374
And we were looking for specific kinds of fish.

27:21.674 --> 27:25.057
When did you first get attracted to anything at the MSC?

27:25.278 --> 27:25.758
It was funny.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.940
That was my senior year in the Corps.

27:28.260 --> 27:32.284
And it caused the big rift with the few of us that were still in the outfit.

27:32.784 --> 27:33.545
We graduated.

27:33.565 --> 27:35.767
There were 13 of us that started out as fish.

27:36.267 --> 27:37.969
Six of us graduated.

27:37.949 --> 27:39.131
Three went to staff.

27:39.812 --> 27:41.034
Three of us stayed in the outfit.

27:41.454 --> 27:46.261
In the outfit, the CO and the EXO, the EXO was John Murray, who had his leg broken.

27:47.203 --> 27:48.384
And I were three tight.

27:48.825 --> 27:50.608
I mean, we were really tight my junior year.

27:51.208 --> 27:52.991
My senior year, we weren't.

27:53.452 --> 27:55.234
I was almost ostracized.

27:55.354 --> 27:57.778
And part of it, there were two reasons for it.

27:57.798 --> 27:58.619
MSC and Kathy.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.864
And I fell in love with Kathy.

28:02.013 --> 28:12.353
I vowed as a sophomore never ever to date one of these women that are coming to campus because they ridiculed me the very first day when I was trying to hunt a fish at the MSC.

28:12.373 --> 28:18.385
I met Kathy who vowed that she would never date somebody in the Corps.

28:18.365 --> 28:20.828
And so we were starting to date pretty solid then.

28:21.429 --> 28:23.892
Now let's see, she was going to school?

28:24.172 --> 28:27.015
Yeah, she was in the first class of women who live on campus.

28:27.075 --> 28:28.878
She was a National Merit Scholar.

28:29.939 --> 28:30.540
From where?

28:30.760 --> 28:35.265
Sweeney, Texas, on an Amoco National Merit Scholarship.

28:35.285 --> 28:37.868
Thank goodness for that, because that's what paid our first year of marriage.

28:39.370 --> 28:42.534
Also billed Warren Russell and John Murray out of jail.

28:46.098 --> 28:47.460
But she...

28:48.301 --> 29:09.921
we met there's a whole side story to that we could have some time about quads that went astray but we started dating the second semester junior year got engaged then stayed up here in two different apartments I worked

29:10.694 --> 29:14.338
in Navistote initially and then as a park ranger at Lake Somerville.

29:14.999 --> 29:17.161
Took summer courses, Kathy did the same.

29:17.181 --> 29:22.787
She worked actually as a waitress up in Rudder Tower at the dining hall after selling Kirby.

29:23.407 --> 29:27.552
And so by the time we came back for our senior year, I was kind of already ostracized.

29:27.632 --> 29:30.155
I wasn't D2 anymore, I didn't believe.

29:30.495 --> 29:31.976
But you were still living in the Corps.

29:31.996 --> 29:33.318
Oh absolutely, absolutely.

29:33.378 --> 29:34.880
I mean I was just ostracized in my office.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.242
There were only three of us, so I was ostracized.

29:37.643 --> 29:54.990
And so what I ended up doing was I was the officer in charge of morale and extracurricular activities, and I'm going, okay, if you're going to be a leader and you're supposed to be involved in outside stuff, and even though extracurricular is only 10% in general more, let's max out the 10%.

29:55.030 --> 29:56.192
That was my goal.

29:56.442 --> 30:00.609
I kept stats my junior year and senior year where we stood in general moral rankings.

30:00.629 --> 30:02.211
And so we had all that stuff in there.

30:03.273 --> 30:05.196
So I got active in political forum.

30:05.917 --> 30:14.991
And so between anthropology, Cathy and political forum, I fell in love with the whole part of the A&M I'd never seen before.

30:15.427 --> 30:16.951
It was good times.

30:17.011 --> 30:18.655
I mean, that was absolutely the best year.

30:18.675 --> 30:20.159
My grades were doing much better.

30:20.660 --> 30:24.169
Did Wayne Stark kind of draw you into his... Not at that stage.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.635
I was a committee chairman and Wayne...

30:27.340 --> 30:29.523
put a lot of stock in the officers.

30:29.583 --> 30:33.027
He didn't like committee chairmen because we were too mavericks.

30:33.047 --> 30:34.730
Too much of a maverick.

30:35.070 --> 30:38.695
And political forum and great issues in Scotland were pretty maverick.

30:38.735 --> 30:41.378
We fought each other all the time for resources and everything else.

30:42.239 --> 30:53.754
So my senior year I was major programs chair and so my fifth year when I was working on a degree and I was outside the corps was the year I was chair of political forum.

30:54.515 --> 30:54.715
No.

30:55.236 --> 30:55.997
Was that the year?

30:57.243 --> 30:59.125
Yeah, and then my graduate year I was president.

31:00.006 --> 31:09.055
All right, with political forum, who were, describe any experiences you remember of having some high visibility people here to speak?

31:09.075 --> 31:12.699
The year I was chair, we had, oh, it was cool.

31:13.159 --> 31:15.982
We had John Anderson and Bob Strauss.

31:17.403 --> 31:23.149
John Anderson, who was a minority leader at that time, and Bob Strauss, who just left his ambassadorship at that stage.

31:23.618 --> 31:25.363
They were talking Democrat, Republican Party.

31:25.503 --> 31:32.442
We had Bob Phillips, or Howard Phillips, who at that time was way on the conservative side, and Frank McElwood's way on the liberal side.

31:33.084 --> 31:34.267
And so they were our speakers.

31:34.648 --> 31:38.438
And the reason I got energized about PF and the MSC as a whole

31:39.127 --> 31:49.316
Here was a place that somebody that was a nobody could sit there and talk with people who took time out to listen to them and talk and treat them as an adult.

31:49.337 --> 31:50.420
And that was really unusual.

31:51.302 --> 31:54.351
And we did all the sketch stuff.
