WEBVTT

00:01.212 --> 00:11.222
There's one with a government job in aid, and 
another one with an architect engineer firm out of

00:01.212 --> 00:11.222
Houston. It would have been

00:11.282 --> 00:24.415
engineering and construction side of aid to 
foreign countries.

00:26.397 --> 00:31.202
And sure enough, I ended up on the list being 
promoted to colonel. And I went in and told Mr.

00:33.241 --> 00:44.413
Turner that I was not going to be able to accept the 
promotion of the Colonel, that I planned to

00:33.241 --> 00:44.413
retire, and that I had told him about it, and that I 
would get down. Well, that was worse than hitting a

00:46.275 --> 00:59.029
beehive with a stick, because a hell of a lot of 
effort had been put in

00:46.275 --> 00:59.029
to make damn sure, I guess, that I'd been promoted. 
You just don't go around and say, hey, we ought to

01:02.767 --> 01:06.372
promote something. Sure. And so we didn't speak 
for a couple of days. And then when we finally got

01:12.260 --> 01:16.285
back to speaking, he said, now you've got to wait a 
minute, boss. You told me I don't have to do

01:16.305 --> 01:19.610
anything but pay taxes and die. I'm getting out. He 
said, well, what would it take for you to stay in? I

01:26.399 --> 01:29.303
said, well, you know, I'm a reserve officer. He 
said, you either get that enigma off my back where

01:29.823 --> 01:39.352
I'm an indefinite reserve and I can go as long as I 
want to go, or I want to be in the record. Why aren't

01:40.814 --> 01:41.975
you in the record now? I said, I've been selected 
three times and each time they ruled me out because

01:42.115 --> 01:47.620
of my eyes.

01:51.364 --> 01:51.744
Okay. Two days later he came back and he said, 
you're taking a physical out of Andrew? Yeah. He

01:57.329 --> 01:58.790
said, well, they've marked that thing out. It no 
longer says retirement fiscal. It says

02:00.832 --> 02:02.974
appointment fiscal. You're going to be appointed 
into the regular Air Force. I said, well, I'm

02:06.778 --> 02:09.420
curious how that happened. He says, well, when 
this thing came to the secretary, he didn't

02:09.440 --> 02:18.249
hesitate to say, hell, I'll ask the Surgeon 
General to waive his eyesight. And here's the

02:18.269 --> 02:22.272
letter he sent the Surgeon General, and here's the 
letter back from the Surgeon General. He says,

02:22.833 --> 02:25.095
they waived your eyesight. He says, you're in the 
regular. I said, OK. So they're in the regulars and

02:27.788 --> 02:31.593
you're full colonel. Well, I could do the grade 
full colonel because I accepted the promotion.

02:37.279 --> 02:43.887
But because of a lot of personnel thing that would 
take a long time to explain, my permit grade was

02:37.279 --> 02:43.887
major. See? Well, ultimately it caught up, got up 
the colonel. But because of a certain thing, my

02:49.634 --> 02:53.299
permit grade was major. But that didn't hurt 
because then I could retire on, what I was wearing

02:57.134 --> 02:58.416
on my shoulders. Sure. Okay. Okay. The very next 
thing that happens is, well, you know, the minute I

03:02.502 --> 03:09.732
got you promoted, I knew I had to lose you, so you're 
going to have to go overseas. I said, yep, I've

03:09.972 --> 03:12.396
already got my orders. What do you mean you got your 
orders? I said, well, I've got an alert. Where are

03:15.881 --> 03:16.442
you going? I said, I'm going to Thailand. What the 
hell are you going to do in Thailand? I said, I'm

03:20.768 --> 03:23.091
going to be the number one engineer over there. He 
said, I'm going to be responsible for all those

03:24.775 --> 03:30.765
bases you and I have been visiting and worked with 
the Navy whenever we have to have. Oh, you're not

03:31.126 --> 03:32.408
going to do that. Does Goddard know about this? 
Well, this was General Goddard, who then had

03:34.913 --> 03:41.404
replaced Curtin as the top engineer in the Air 
Force. By the way, General Goddard's picture

03:41.424 --> 03:46.854
hangs on the wall over there at the former student. 
But he is a He was a West Point graduate, got his

03:48.248 --> 03:53.176
master's at A&M, but now he lives in North 
Carolina. So you can't reach him. Yeah, but

03:54.117 --> 04:00.447
anyway, this is the Goddard that had been in there a 
couple of times. I worked for him at the Aviation

04:00.868 --> 04:07.558
Engineer Force, went down to North Africa to work 
for him, and now here Goddard is again. I said, no,

04:07.678 --> 04:09.021
he doesn't know anything about it. He said, you get 
me on the phone. Get him on the phone. So they got

04:12.266 --> 04:15.751
together and said, you're not going to Thailand. I 
said, well, where am I going? you know Project

04:18.320 --> 04:20.903
Anglo House? I said, yeah. You mean building those 
1,500 houses over in the United Kingdom? Yeah. He

04:26.070 --> 04:29.615
said, you're going to the United Kingdom. I said, 
who in the hell wants to go build 1,500 houses? You

04:34.041 --> 04:34.462
do. Yes, sir. So off we go to England. This means the 
third time that I've been stationed in England.

04:44.055 --> 04:48.040
War, and then once before, and twice now that she 
goes But we go to England. Well, wasn't that a more

04:49.604 --> 04:54.129
desirable duty in England than Thailand? Well, 
who knew how long the Vietnam-Thailand thing was

04:54.149 --> 04:57.353
going on? Sure. And an old army general said, we 
ain't got but one more, and everybody wants to get

04:58.755 --> 05:04.721
in it.

05:06.904 --> 05:10.908
Well, OK. Yeah, it was a good job. Got over there, 
and we had these 1,500 houses that were to be built,

05:11.990 --> 05:16.795
all of them to be individually owned by a British 
entrepreneur, not owned by our own government,

05:17.399 --> 05:38.064
which meant that they bought the land, they 
designed the house, we approved the design, we

05:17.399 --> 05:38.064
oversaw the construction, and then when the house 
was finished, they owned it, but we guaranteed

05:17.399 --> 05:38.064
occupancy for a five-year period. With American 
military personnel? Yeah. Remember I said

05:41.988 --> 05:45.853
earlier, we built 200 of them up in Scotland for the 
Navy. to support the polarity. Then we also had an

05:48.955 --> 05:57.408
intelligence project that was over the horizon 
radar. It was built up on the coast and it was, we did

05:57.488 --> 06:09.867
the facility work and RCA was at the same time we 
were building, supposed to be trying to develop

06:10.488 --> 06:16.677
the system that would be installed there, and it's 
just what it says, over the horizon radar. Well,

06:16.697 --> 06:17.899
how did that work? Well, it didn't. We finished the 
facility, and we put in all the antenna, built all

06:20.983 --> 06:27.333
the buildings, put in all the shielding. The thing 
was actually constructed on ground elevation

06:27.433 --> 06:35.905
zero, which meant that we had the elevate the 
buildings. The roads were down on zero, but the

06:37.720 --> 06:43.387
buildings were up on piling 16 feet above the 
ground. But anyway, the RCA never got the system

06:43.407 --> 06:50.836
perfected to go in there. And the facility is 
standing right now just as a monument. You might

06:55.001 --> 07:02.830
say it's stupidity, but it was a, what do you call, 
you build while we're developing. It didn't seem

07:02.851 --> 07:04.913
like a very good idea. It was a combination of 
American and British funded. Our job was with the

07:08.572 --> 07:15.302
British engineers and constructors to get it 
built by a certain time date. And I got to- Where was

07:15.322 --> 07:17.325
it built? I beg your pardon? Where was it and where 
was it built? Okay, there are two bases right up on

07:20.330 --> 07:27.922
the coast called Bentwater's Woodbridge. And if 
you drew an angle, I mean, a line off of each one of

07:28.703 --> 07:34.832
them about each flying ahead in the east a little 
bit. It would cross at a place called Orford Ness.

07:42.913 --> 07:48.200
And again, it's on the coast, zero elevation. It 
was an old World War I bombing range. We had to go in

07:50.803 --> 07:57.131
there and clear the mines and all the bombs out 
before we could ever get started. I got a handpick

07:57.151 --> 08:05.562
of a major that I made lieutenant colonel, and he 
has retired as a colonel, too. oversee the thing,

08:05.812 --> 08:09.356
and an outstanding job. But, well, my job didn't, I 
went over on a three-year assignment, and I didn't

08:09.376 --> 08:18.468
get to stay for two years. My boss, who was John 
Bell, came back from a promotion board and called

08:20.270 --> 08:31.644
me in one day and said, type your gear, you're 
fired. I said, you've got to be kidding me. He said,

08:34.408 --> 08:34.688
nope. You're leaving. Can you tell me where I'm 
going? He said, yeah, you're going to Germany.

08:40.800 --> 08:41.741
You're going to Wiesbach. Well, that was 
headquartered in Air Force Europe, which was the

08:41.882 --> 08:46.527
next headquarters higher. I said, OK. What am I 
going to do over there? He said, you're going to be

08:51.252 --> 08:53.755
the top engineer. I said, well, what's happened to 
Jim? He said, Jim's already agreed to go. He's had

08:59.762 --> 09:04.006
three chances to make general, and he hasn't made 
it, so he's agreed to quit. Who is Jim? Jim Finlan,

09:05.026 --> 09:11.053
Colonel Finlan, was sitting in the chair over 
there. So he was the chief engineer over there?

09:13.716 --> 09:13.816
Yeah. He went to Germany the same year I went to 
England. We went over on the ship together, on the

09:17.400 --> 09:22.285
United States, by the way. Jim had had one chance in 
Pentagon, two chances in Germany, and wasn't

09:23.226 --> 09:29.173
selected, so he said, I'll back out. So he was 
resigning, or retiring? Yeah. And... So I went

09:34.608 --> 09:40.676
over and I said, OK, I guess so. And he says, there's 
no guessing about it. It's already set up. You're

09:44.121 --> 09:44.862
going over. You're it. And so I just went over and 
didn't do anything different. Just kept right on

09:53.754 --> 09:58.461
working and doing whatever had to be done. So your 
job in Germany was to be the engineer then. for the

10:04.477 --> 10:08.381
entire Air Force of all of Europe. That must have 
been a tremendous responsibility. See, he had

10:12.645 --> 10:18.331
been there two years as a colonel and didn't make 
general. So I went in there and it

10:19.012 --> 10:34.247
was my intention to stay

10:19.012 --> 10:34.247
until the tour was over and then come home and 
retire. How long do you stay in the service? MR.

10:37.316 --> 10:37.657
Sure. And we were relaxing one afternoon, getting 
ready to go to a party that night, and General

10:37.677 --> 10:50.413
Holzapfel, the four-star, called and he said – I 
said, yes, sir. And he said, this is Randy. I said,

10:52.776 --> 10:54.318
yes, sir. He said, in one hour, the President will 
nominate this year's list of new Brigadier

11:01.683 --> 11:07.411
General to the Senate, and I want to let you know 
that you're on that list. What did you feel like?

11:09.033 --> 11:12.878
And I had been going retirement homes, and I just 
threw them up in the air. And she looked at me, and

11:13.018 --> 11:21.750
she said, are you on the General's

11:13.018 --> 11:21.750
list? I said, yeah. She said, what do you think? I 
said, oh, it'll be worse than ever now. Because it

11:25.055 --> 11:27.538
is, and I knew it was.

11:29.948 --> 11:31.250
The colonel has a lot of power. The general has 
absolutely none. Why do you say that? Well, you go

11:37.077 --> 11:41.443
where they tell you to go. You say what they tell you 
to say. You do what they tell you to do. And

11:48.232 --> 11:57.424
you just got a little more limitation the type of 
conduct or what and

11:58.231 --> 12:26.803
i'm sure you've heard the phrase and it's true it's 
lonesome

11:58.231 --> 12:26.803
it really is why

11:58.231 --> 12:26.803
subordinates don't come up and socially social 
you know associated

11:58.231 --> 12:26.803
you make your own social life You either go out and 
socialize with other general officers, and hell,

12:27.965 --> 12:34.675
there may not be any others. Or you reach down and 
try to pick a few colonels, and they may not want to

12:35.857 --> 12:44.930
socialize

12:35.857 --> 12:44.930
with you. It's a different life altogether when 
you cross that line. Altogether.

12:55.049 --> 13:03.457
A colonel can be given a job that no matter what you 
think about it, he can say, you know, that thing

12:55.049 --> 13:03.457
could be, a major could do that job. And we realize, 
colonel, but we want you to do it, you know. You've

13:06.940 --> 13:08.021
got the qualifications. We've got to get this job 
done. Or he can sit in this job that the table of

13:10.243 --> 13:14.628
organization calls for a brigadier general. But 
he's still a colonel. You know, and he's looked at.

13:17.230 --> 13:17.790
He's a colonel. You cross that damn line, 
everybody's

13:26.403 --> 13:27.325
You're under scrutiny.

13:31.414 --> 13:37.446
And you've also got one other thing. When the next 
list comes along, you know, the next promotion

13:37.466 --> 13:47.247
list, the pressure is on for you to get out. Because 
they can't promote that guy that's on this list

13:48.543 --> 13:52.707
until you make a vacancy. So of all the existing 
generals, after they get 60 up down here waiting,

13:52.727 --> 13:58.933
the pressure is on. We've got to get these guys 
promoted before the end of the year so we can put

13:59.754 --> 14:04.239
another 60 on the list. So the pressure is on. You 
think about retiring? Every once in a while

14:09.284 --> 14:11.366
they're like, hey, you think about retiring? 
That's what people would say to you? Oh, sure. What

14:15.172 --> 14:16.073
type of people? I mean, personnel people. 
Personnel people. But anyway. Well, what did you

14:25.463 --> 14:27.445
answer when they asked you? Are you thinking about 
retiring? No, not yet. Not yet. Not for a while.

14:33.932 --> 14:43.682
Now, like I said, they come out with this list, and 
the Senate approves it, and then as the vacancy

14:33.932 --> 14:43.682
comes, you step up. Certainly. So here it was in 
Christmas, the list came out, and I went to New

14:45.074 --> 15:06.218
Year's Day, not the next year, but one whole year 
before I ever got off the list and changed Eagle to a

14:45.074 --> 15:06.218
star. One year. Waiting for a job. That's right. 
No, not for a job. Just an opening. I had a job. I

15:13.806 --> 15:14.727
stayed there. So you were waiting for somebody 
else to retire. That's right. I stayed there. When

15:21.005 --> 15:23.848
I left, still didn't have an opening. Went to the 
log command in Ohio, and I was there six months

15:24.129 --> 15:31.257
before an opening came. They gave me the 
promotion. That's true all over the Air Force.

15:36.143 --> 15:40.207
Now, the Army and the Navy, they don't do it that 
way, but the Air Force. Well, how do they do it now? I

15:41.349 --> 15:44.272
don't know. I don't know. I don't know when they 
make the decision, but there's a term called

15:45.503 --> 15:52.975
frocking. They let a guy change the insignia on his 
shoulder, but he doesn't get paid until the

15:52.995 --> 16:03.492
vacancy occurs because Congress is limited 
because of appropriation. But a guy may be wearing

16:04.594 --> 16:10.363
something in the Army and the Navy, but he's still 
being paid something different. Every once in a

16:11.356 --> 16:18.167
while the Air Force will truck somebody, 
especially if they're going to go overseas and

16:11.356 --> 16:18.167
work for the foreign government. And if he's on a 
promotion list, they'll let him go ahead and

16:18.407 --> 16:23.736
change his signal. But if he's working with his own 
people, they don't truck him.

16:30.767 --> 16:32.149
Never got into wire. what the reasoning is, 
whether good or bad or whatever. It sounds to me

16:35.878 --> 16:42.706
then that you went from being promoted to a full 
colonel to a brigadier general in just two years.

16:45.689 --> 16:47.431
Yep, that's about right. Well, that's 
extraordinarily fast. How can you count for that?

16:56.221 --> 16:58.424
I had people that believed in me. I had people that 
were, you know, you'd call them They were my

17:03.095 --> 17:04.136
sponsor.

17:08.120 --> 17:14.426
The one, I guess, that bleed in me the most was Mr. 
Turner.

17:16.388 --> 17:31.363
The vice commander of Air Force Europe was a 
three-star gentleman by the name of George

17:16.388 --> 17:31.363
Simler, who is deceased.

17:33.318 --> 17:48.054
General Bell, the commander of the 3rd Air Force, 
that I was working for there in England, was quite

17:33.318 --> 17:48.054
impressed with what we were doing and what I was 
able to get done working through and with the

17:33.318 --> 17:48.054
British.

17:51.698 --> 18:02.650
And then General Goddard, who was the director of 
civil engineering, the top engineer in the Air

17:51.698 --> 18:02.650
Force, who I had worked for at the Aviation 
Engineering Force, quite

18:03.642 --> 18:33.632
aware of what I could do and so on and I guess I have to 
say those poor gentlemen were probably

18:03.642 --> 18:33.632
responsible for seeing that General Holden was 
convinced that I would be promoted and of course by

18:03.642 --> 18:33.632
him recommending

18:03.642 --> 18:33.632
if he hadn't recommended me I would never have made 
it because any Air Force All the recommendations

18:34.355 --> 18:41.125
come in from the commanders of what we call the 
major commands. They

18:41.145 --> 18:47.494
all come to a very big pool. And then a group of 
general officers review these people. And they

18:53.002 --> 19:02.556
reduce the total that had come in down to some 
agreed upon figure, like three for every one to be

18:53.002 --> 19:02.556
selected. Remember I said my General Bell had come 
back from a promotion board. He sat on that board

19:07.828 --> 19:12.414
the year before I made it. That's the reason he knew 
the other guy hadn't made it and wasn't going to

19:12.434 --> 19:18.923
make it because he didn't even get by that board. 
From here, whatever it's agreed upon that year, it

19:18.943 --> 19:27.254
may be, okay, we're going to promote 60, put 180 to 
the last board. Or it may be put 120 to the last

19:27.274 --> 19:29.717
board. It reduces the amount of effort to the last 
board. So you've got to get out of command, you've

19:32.405 --> 19:38.430
got to get past this board, and then you've got to be 
selected by that last one. And the last one is a

19:38.450 --> 19:49.240
bunch of four stars that are sitting

19:38.450 --> 19:49.240
there. You all but say, how in the hell? How did I do 
it? I'm not told. Anybody ask me, what do you think?

19:57.807 --> 20:00.690
I'm one grade higher than I ever expected to be. If 
I'd have done it, don't ask me how I did

20:02.155 --> 20:08.141
it. And yet, that's what I tell them publicly or 
what. Whenever my subordinates would come to me,

20:15.228 --> 20:24.577
my military supporters, not civilians, come to me 
and say, I've got to make out my career sheet. The

20:24.597 --> 20:27.640
Air Force has got a personnel thing to keep having 
here. Junior year officers make out. What do you

20:30.001 --> 20:31.002
want to do next? When do you want to go to school and 
so on? Service is one. When you leave here and I

20:36.408 --> 20:40.273
leave here, I thought maybe I'd like to do showing 
something. Sounds pretty good. That's something

20:41.174 --> 20:43.957
you haven't done and you want to experience. Then I 
thought I'll go to school. What kind of? Oh,

20:47.681 --> 20:50.244
squadron officers. What do you want to go there 
for? Well, I ought to get it on my records that I've

20:52.887 --> 20:55.450
been to school. After that, the school would show 
up again. I said, where are you going to get all

21:00.963 --> 21:03.786
those school spots? You've got to get them on your 
record. I said, well, maybe. I said, you know, the

21:10.112 --> 21:14.777
pendulum swings back and forth, and you've got to 
watch that pendulum. If you've got a whole bunch of

21:14.797 --> 21:23.385
people in personnel or at the top that are saying, 
go to school, go to school, and by all means, get

21:14.797 --> 21:23.385
school on your record. Remember, you can take it 
back to our spotters. And

21:26.632 --> 21:39.792
I can remember one of these guys thinking, he said, 
General, what schools have you been

21:26.632 --> 21:39.792
to? I said, I went to Adjutant General School six 
weeks. I went to Academic Instructor School six

21:42.677 --> 21:46.563
weeks. I went to a school to learn how to be an 
Inspector General two weeks. I went to the Atomic

21:50.569 --> 21:53.613
Defense Construction Course for maybe two weeks. 
I said, I've been to four schools.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.446
What do you do the other time? Work. I said, and I 
work for other people, not for other Air Force

22:01.127 --> 22:07.754
engineers if I cannot help it. I work for civilians 
that have gotten power. I work for other branches

22:10.377 --> 22:14.641
of the service. Work for the Army. Work with the 
Navy. Somebody else is writing that ticket. And

22:20.908 --> 22:26.153
try to be sure that it's not somebody that you're 
competing with that's writing your ticket.

22:28.597 --> 22:33.906
Somebody that's not going to say, boy, if I build 
him up too great, he's going to pass me in. I never

22:36.189 --> 22:39.034
thought about that. But work, production is the 
key. We're not in this service to go to school.

22:46.887 --> 22:51.735
We're not in this service to do anything but 
remember. The Air Force mission is to fly and to

22:52.880 --> 23:05.797
fight, and it's up to you as an engineer to keep the 
facilities available so that they can fly and

22:52.880 --> 23:05.797
fight.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.099
Not go to school. Well, you have to admit that your 
career was rather unusual. I've interviewed a

23:10.604 --> 23:18.735
number of generals, and they have command schools 
and more colleges on their record. Most of them say

23:19.441 --> 23:23.006
in Stanley that they were very valuable 
experiences. That's right. You see, down the

23:24.388 --> 23:29.075
line, you're going to get me back under another 
civilian. I have worked under two GS-18s. And I'll

23:31.879 --> 23:39.230
bet you that you can find very, very few that ever 
worked for civilians. Most of the time they've

23:39.470 --> 23:41.614
been working for other military. But I worked for 
two civilians, and I convinced one of them I could

23:41.814 --> 23:47.322
produce, and that was Turner's. I know that Turner 
got me promoted to colonel, and I know damn good and

23:48.095 --> 23:58.889
well he was partially responsible for getting me 
promoted

23:48.095 --> 23:58.889
to colonel. So your years in the Pentagon were 
really the key then? Sure. Just think, I could have

24:04.196 --> 24:06.799
gone to ROTC for the second time. Yeah. And then you 
would have retired as lieutenant colonel

24:07.721 --> 24:12.006
probably. That's right. Yep. Well, let's talk 
about Germany here, 1970-1971. This is a

24:17.399 --> 24:25.351
tremendous responsibility as the chief engineer 
for the Air Force in Europe. Did you have any major

24:25.371 --> 24:27.414
problems? Problems? No. Challenges? Sure. What 
were some of the challenges? Well, we

24:34.965 --> 24:44.899
had our fighters dispersed, of course, on base. We 
were now putting them in hardened shelters. And

24:49.645 --> 24:58.156
again, under the concurrency concept, we were 
putting them in hardened shelters, but the

24:49.645 --> 24:58.156
shelters didn't have any doors on them. And so 
while we were erecting and building the shelters

24:58.176 --> 25:13.857
on the continent, they were testing the different 
proposed doors back here in the United States.

25:14.630 --> 25:18.836
They finally approved the design of one. And the 
company that won the contract was a company by the

25:18.856 --> 25:28.508
name of Marway Steel. And they established a plant 
in Luxembourg, which was just across the border

25:28.869 --> 25:36.579
from here. And they manufactured and fabricated 
the doors and then brought them up and installed

25:36.599 --> 25:42.747
them and so on. And these shelters were designed to 
withstand like a nuclear blast? Well, not a direct

25:49.863 --> 25:51.685
nuke. No, of course not. But they were principally 
designed against just a high explosion.

26:03.758 --> 26:12.548
When you start designing against nuclear, you're 
just making it too costly to protect one bird, one

26:03.758 --> 26:12.548
aircraft. These were above ground. Oh yeah, above 
ground. And armor plated doors.

26:24.519 --> 26:34.374
They, well, you just don't go through something of 
that magnitude without having different

26:24.519 --> 26:34.374
challenges. What else besides, did you finish 
those? Oh yeah, we finished them. So now we have

26:40.658 --> 26:43.383
these shelters at every air base? In Germany. Oh, 
in Germany? Yeah, not in England. Okay. Then we

26:48.591 --> 26:53.019
were bringing the F-111 in to England. And, of 
course, we had been working on that while I was over

26:53.740 --> 26:58.428
there in England. And, of course, it wasn't yet 
completed. That's the one place that we did have

27:03.196 --> 27:05.620
to... come up with new stories because what we had 
had in there before then was reconnaissance type

27:06.106 --> 27:16.861
aircraft, not bombers. So we had the new problems 
there. How did you resolve those? Well, just lots

27:24.032 --> 27:31.202
of meetings with British people and British 
agencies and so on. Were the British still

27:31.655 --> 27:36.163
sympathetic to having nuclear warheads? The 
government was. Of course, some of the people in

27:38.047 --> 27:39.930
the countryside. That's good old farmland that 
you're taking away from us. Let's see, the heart

27:47.124 --> 27:53.916
shelters,

28:10.467 --> 28:23.343
The chief staff of the Air Force in Washington, 
General Ryan,

28:10.467 --> 28:23.343
I had briefed General Ryan a number of times. In 
fact, I had briefed him on the F-111 move and so on.

28:26.927 --> 28:33.074
And General Ryan lives here in San Antonio now. But 
he issued a policy that said, I want all

28:40.353 --> 28:50.022
headquarters moved to an air base, an air force 
base. An air force base, by definition, means

28:50.402 --> 28:54.887
you've got a runway. I don't want anything, 
industrial complex or something like that, move

28:54.907 --> 29:00.692
everything. He said, I want my people to be able to 
smell jet fuel. How are you going to think? flying,

29:07.471 --> 29:17.582
unless you see flying, unless you hear flying, and 
that was

29:07.471 --> 29:17.582
it. When I got to Wiesbaden, Germany, General 
Holzapfel called me in. He says,

29:21.947 --> 29:28.914
General Ryan says we're going to move to Ramstein. 
I said, all right. I said, I'll get down there and

29:31.217 --> 29:34.861
check the facilities out and so on. He said, wait a 
minute, wait a minute. More than that, I said,

29:38.504 --> 29:40.406
what's that? And he says, normally a move like this 
would be planned and written by ops plans or a

29:40.687 --> 29:54.104
planning program, somebody like that. He said, 
they've been fiddling around with this thing for

29:54.124 --> 29:57.148
over a year. They're finding a thousand reasons 
why this headquarters can't be moved to Ramstein.

30:05.558 --> 30:07.060
Yes, I could hear it coming. He says, you will write 
the plan to move this headquarters to Ramstein.

30:14.410 --> 30:16.132
Well, that's not really an engineer's job. Our job 
is to support it, to determine what facilities are

30:16.333 --> 30:23.243
needed, crank it into the plan, and everything. He 
says, don't come back and tell me why we can't go.

30:26.027 --> 30:31.055
Come back to the plan that says how we will go. He 
says, now, I realize I realize you're just a

30:31.075 --> 30:35.882
colonel. You're going to knock heads with a 
two-star general over there, and you're going to

30:36.689 --> 30:41.514
knock heads with a one-star general over there. 
But you just stay with it. I will announce the

30:45.598 --> 30:54.948
assignment tomorrow morning at the staff 
meeting, and I'll expect your full cooperation.

30:54.968 --> 30:56.750
We wrote the plan. Headquarters is now in 
Ramstein. And it moved. Did you have problems with

31:02.455 --> 31:04.958
your one- and two-star generals? Not when he says 
they're writing a plan. It's not why we can't move.

31:11.158 --> 31:13.381
It's how we're going to move. That was it. But I 
didn't know that they'd been messing around with

31:15.024 --> 31:21.694
it for a year and a half. Sure, over in England, we 
keep hearing, hey, the headquarter's got to move

31:21.714 --> 31:25.179
the ramps. Never happened. Never happened. Sure 
enough, he never came up with a plan. He just come up

31:28.244 --> 31:29.746
with a plan. He just gave you the responsibility. 
Yeah, that was it. Of course I had to find me some

31:33.980 --> 31:41.271
people in my own staff that could work on such a 
plant because that's not our daily work. But we did

31:41.311 --> 31:49.905
it and he

31:41.311 --> 31:49.905
moved. We had a real good guy that wasn't there very 
long and that was Jay Robin. He was I guess I don't

32:02.684 --> 32:04.386
guess we even overlapped. He was in there, and 
somebody had taken his job by the time I got there.

32:08.850 --> 32:20.702
But I

32:08.850 --> 32:20.702
mentioned this at breakfast this morning to 
another retired Air Force general about your

32:08.850 --> 32:20.702
experience with Jay and spending two days with 
him. And he said, why didn't you tell him to spend 30

32:20.722 --> 32:24.326
years with him like we did? He used to be the 
inspector general. That's a hell of a time.

32:34.257 --> 32:57.025
Another interesting thing, following the war,

32:34.257 --> 32:57.025
they established an organization of civilians 
called

32:34.257 --> 32:57.025
the General Service Unit. And it was made up of 
Germans, Turks, Italians,

33:05.712 --> 33:15.587
few Spanish, and it had one Air Force officer

33:05.712 --> 33:15.587
as its advisor.

33:18.872 --> 33:33.795
The whole thing was set up on a military 
organization, but they were all civilians, and

33:18.872 --> 33:33.795
they were all from the different nationalities 
that were just wandering around Europe trying to

33:18.872 --> 33:33.795
find a place, abbreviated the GSU.

33:38.146 --> 33:47.940
That unit did various jobs of construction. Most 
of the design we did in our own staff, then gave them

33:47.960 --> 33:51.845
the job. Anywhere we told them to go. Put them on a 
job in Turkey, lay a pipeline across the river,

33:55.851 --> 34:02.901
something like that. And they did jobs that had to 
be done in a hurry, that we couldn't take the time to

34:07.340 --> 34:20.716
go out to bid for, or it may be a job just to keep them 
occupied in order to keep the unit in being. And it

34:20.736 --> 34:29.426
was located at one of the bases, and I had a captain 
that was, believe it or not, a captain, not very

34:20.736 --> 34:29.426
much, but he was part of it. Most of the captains we 
put there were sharp guys, and they were their

34:29.446 --> 34:34.512
advisors. And any time they have a problem with our 
staff back at the headquarters, we'll lose up to

34:35.470 --> 34:44.905
the captain to wade in and help get the problem 
solved. But we use that unit all over Europe and

34:44.925 --> 34:51.957
into Turkey.

34:55.963 --> 34:59.689
It wasn't a case of election when one of their 
People that might say it was an officer level

35:00.293 --> 35:07.583
either left or died or retired or something like 
that. And the captain would come back to the boss,

35:07.603 --> 35:15.975
whoever's sitting in my chair, and say, OK, now 
we've got to decide who we're going to promote up.

35:15.995 --> 35:21.422
And they were organized along the military line, 
even though they were civilians. They had their

35:21.442 --> 35:24.987
own camp, their own dining halls, everything. The 
Air Force now has a number of units that were copied

35:29.993 --> 35:46.409
from that organization, but they are military 
organizations.

35:46.429 --> 35:50.293
Why'd you only stay at this job for one year, 1970 
and 1971? When

35:51.154 --> 35:58.161
you are a Brigadier General, or any kind of gun in 
the airport. When the chief of staff tells you to go

36:03.553 --> 36:13.802
over there and do that job, you say, yes, sir, or 
else you say, here's my badge. The General

36:15.483 --> 36:23.470
Holzapfel left as commander of USAID, of Air Force 
Europe. And General Jones, who is now the chairman

36:24.591 --> 36:28.114
of the Joint Chief, commander of USAFD. And he had a 
protege by the name of Bob Thompson that had been

36:33.806 --> 36:54.127
his engineer when he was a SAC commander at the base 
over in Louisiana. And he wanted Thompson to be his

36:54.147 --> 36:58.472
engineer. And it was as simple as that. He just 
tells the person, tells the general assignment

37:01.662 --> 37:06.189
officer, I want Thompson to come in. Now it's up to 
the general assignment to start, OK, what happens

37:06.890 --> 37:10.375
now? So this, remember I used the name McGarvey, 
was the engineer in

37:10.636 --> 37:23.095
the air staff when we were building Tuiwa. He got 
promoted from colonel to general. OK, he's now

37:25.499 --> 37:27.362
sitting out it. Air Force Logistics Command at 
Wright-Patterson, and he's been out there for a

37:28.388 --> 37:35.999
number of years, and it's about time that he would 
have an overseas assignment. So they picked

37:36.019 --> 37:43.069
McGarvey up, sent him overseas, and okay, you go in 
and take McGarvey's place at Wright-Patterson.

37:43.089 --> 37:45.833
Did you get an opportunity to meet General Jones? 
General Jones? Oh, yeah. What was your

37:47.596 --> 37:50.220
impressions of him? Oh...

37:56.288 --> 37:56.809
I never...

37:59.675 --> 38:12.109
I never really tried to draw

37:59.675 --> 38:12.109
to develop an analysis and say, what kind of guy we 
got here.

38:13.511 --> 38:24.504
When I knew him, he was in a very, very difficult 
position to

38:13.511 --> 38:24.504
say, this is the real guy. Because he was sitting as 
General Holzapfel's deputy. wearing three

38:29.510 --> 38:36.638
stars, but he knew that he was going to be the 
commander in just one, two, or three months. And

38:37.559 --> 38:50.995
that's a real bad time because, man, you're trying 
already to get things straightened out, to run the

38:37.559 --> 38:50.995
way you want them, you're trying to get your staff, 
you know, like General Goddard and I were in there

38:52.730 --> 38:55.513
in his office. General Goddard, again, is out of 
Washington. He came over and paid a visit. Out of

39:00.379 --> 39:02.982
courtesy, he said, well, I better go see Joan. When 
we walked out, Joan says, hey, guy, Goddard. He

39:07.247 --> 39:13.474
says, get Bob Thompson over here to be Hub's 
deputy, because when Hub leaves, I want him to be my

39:07.247 --> 39:13.474
engineer. So two steps out in the hall, I turned to 
Goddard, and I said, where am I going? He said,

39:19.081 --> 39:22.585
that's the first I heard, that you're going. Four 
stars have got that much power. And they should

39:25.483 --> 39:28.508
have. How did that make you feel, though? I went to 
Texas A&M. I've been exposed to a lot of things. I

39:36.279 --> 39:41.186
just turned to the director of engineering and, 
well, it looks like I'm going. Where am I going?

39:44.430 --> 39:47.354
Because I knew I'd already been to the charm 
schools. They went here on that promotion list.

39:49.177 --> 39:51.340
Immediately, boy, they bring all the new 
Selectees in, and we go through what's called a

39:52.214 --> 39:57.320
charm school for a whole week in Washington. Tell 
me about that. Oh, yeah. We're lectured to. Is this

40:01.366 --> 40:02.707
in all services? No, this is Air Force. OK. But we 
are lectured to by the chief of staff of all of the

40:05.150 --> 40:12.019
services, the commandant of the Marines, the 
chief of staff of the Army. Westmoreland talked to

40:12.540 --> 40:13.921
us. He talked to us and used every bit of his time and 
left no time for questions. We knew what was

40:20.176 --> 40:21.298
happening. Hell, we were loaded for it. Ran out of 
time. But anyway, all of the chiefs talked to us,

40:25.606 --> 40:35.483
and then we get certain rules that are laid down to 
us, you know, verbally, and then we get certain

40:25.606 --> 40:35.483
advice. Well, what kind of things do they tell you 
for this week? All colonels designate generals.

40:41.133 --> 40:41.654
That's right. Okay, and what do they tell you? 
What's expected of you as a general officer is what

40:43.447 --> 40:47.292
I was addressing a while ago. Instead of, you're no 
longer a colonel, you're a general officer.

40:50.797 --> 40:54.162
You've got more eyes watching you now than ever 
have watched you before. What you do in the public

40:54.843 --> 41:00.350
will be known, if it's wrong tomorrow, all over the 
world. Well, you can say these things in a hurry,

41:00.811 --> 41:12.407
but they're told to you from time to time as you're 
there and they talk about public relations. What

41:12.843 --> 41:15.567
other topics besides public relations? Probably 
getting along with Congress and stuff like that.

41:18.992 --> 41:19.793
Oh, yeah. The director of legislative liaison 
comes in and says, now, I know that some of you have

41:19.813 --> 41:25.241
never been on the Hill. Some of you have probably 
had more time on the Hill than I have. And lay it out.

41:33.714 --> 41:41.365
Then you will have a protocol-type dinner or lunch 
in which OK, now, let's go through some protocol.

41:43.938 --> 41:52.508
And it's just a wrap-up of everything you ought to 
know before you get out there and stump your toes.

41:52.528 --> 41:53.509
Sure. And then, of course, there's always the guy 
that's one of the top generals that has got a pretty

41:53.529 --> 42:07.705
good story about the, OK, now I'm going to give you 
some rules that you won't find anywhere.

42:07.725 --> 42:11.689
Don't let the bastards wear you down.

42:12.192 --> 42:16.157
Don't get between the dog and the lamppost.

42:16.958 --> 42:18.459
Explain what he's talking about. Damn easy now 
that you're a general to get caught between these.

42:26.288 --> 42:27.350
Just don't get in there. Watch.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.359
It's an interesting theory.

42:37.962 --> 42:39.904
But anyway, we stepped out of the into the hall and I 
turned to this Goddard and I said, where am I going?

42:43.914 --> 42:46.317
He said, I don't know, but you're going. I said, 
well, as soon as you got an idea, let me know. Well,

42:51.022 --> 42:52.504
it's about to be a good one. It'll be one of the major 
commands. OK. So off to log command at Wright Pack.

43:00.894 --> 43:04.778
And of course, the minute I get to log command, This 
four-star General Merrill that I had dealt with up

43:05.534 --> 43:12.321
in Hartford, Connecticut on the museum, he's 
still the commander. So I know the man. I don't have

43:14.242 --> 43:20.268
to go into a new man and say, hey, if you haven't 
heard of me, I've heard of you. It's just, hey,

43:20.308 --> 43:24.192
welcome aboard. There's your desk. Go. So you were 
the Logistics Command, 1971 to 72.

43:34.964 --> 43:38.429
The museum's already built up there. What other 
things are you working on? Okay. The logistics

43:41.533 --> 43:53.448
command, just briefly, in the Air Force, is 
responsible for all the supply and the

43:41.533 --> 43:53.448
refurbishment and modification of all the 
aircraft. And it has four huge depots. One at

43:58.175 --> 44:04.583
McClellan in California, one at Ogden, Utah, One 
at Oklahoma City, one here at San Antonio, one at

44:05.963 --> 44:13.432
Warner Robins. And any one of those five plants' 
facility is valued more than any one of the other

44:13.452 --> 44:28.269
installations in the airport, even more than the 
SAC places. Why? Because of their shops, their

44:29.050 --> 44:35.498
sizes of their warehouses, the automation. I'm 
not talking about the aircraft, I'm talking about

44:36.035 --> 44:41.221
the physical land. On top of that we've got our log 
command has four or five other smaller places that

44:42.603 --> 44:50.752
deal strictly in patrol with them or something 
like that. But these places are absolutely huge.

44:56.338 --> 45:00.523
All of them have the runways that are equal to the 
SAC bases because Here at Kelly, the C-5 comes in

45:00.908 --> 45:04.894
and the B-52s come in. They work on the B-52s here at 
Kelly in San Antonio. And each of the aircraft

45:09.200 --> 45:15.590
systems are assigned to one of these depots. They 
don't work on the F-111 at all. Five of them. They

45:18.233 --> 45:20.677
only work on the F-111 at one place. They only work 
on the C-5 here at Kelly. And so on. So this is the...

45:26.085 --> 45:30.291
And we were going through... An update and 
modification of facilities is not something that

45:31.030 --> 45:41.851
I started, but this general ahead of me, McGarvey, 
had started it, and it was a lap over. I inherited it

45:41.971 --> 45:54.034
and kept going on the time phasing that had been 
established to program and go to the Air Force and

45:41.971 --> 45:54.034
get it into the program before the Congress. get 
the authorization and appropriations to upgrade

45:54.824 --> 45:59.670
some of our ancient facilities. Because all these 
bases, if you knew them, are some of the oldest

45:59.690 --> 46:06.538
bases that are in the Air Force Headquarters. So 
you were making improvements? Well, what we call

46:07.920 --> 46:11.865
upgrades, yeah. That's a principle thing. Got 
there just in time for the opening of the Air Force

46:13.707 --> 46:17.852
Museum, by the way. Oh, great. Yeah. And the 
president was there to open it.

46:25.418 --> 46:44.045
And that was amazing because we had to establish a 
little cosmetic booth just inside the door so that

46:25.418 --> 46:44.045
when he got off the airplane and got in the car, when 
he hit the news end, he went in the booth so they

46:25.418 --> 46:44.045
could, you know, fix him all up, cosmetic wires, 
hit television. I thought Reagan was the only one

46:44.065 --> 46:47.269
that did that. Excellent. Did that quite a bit. 
This was excellent. I'm kidding. That is

46:52.457 --> 46:54.700
fantastic. So every time Mr. Nixon went to a new 
area, he'd have a little... Every time Mr. Nixon

46:55.355 --> 47:01.315
went to...
