I've got three more questions.

00:20.582 --> 00:32.923
If you had the fiscal capability to make a very large gift to Texas A&M, for what purpose would you want that gift to be used?

00:37.088 --> 00:42.996
Somebody walks up to you and gives you a check for a million dollars, says you've got to pass this on to A&M, but you decide what they do with it.

00:47.943 --> 00:51.889
I don't know if I can answer that many times.

00:53.030 --> 00:56.515
Do you have any favorite things at A&M that you wish they could do?

01:05.084 --> 01:32.138
I think that the school and the engineering profession would be better off would gain if there was I'm not saying that every engineering student should should be required to take say a six-year academic course to graduate in engineering but I think there should be

01:34.987 --> 01:49.065
maybe an endowment, maybe a way to take those students who are so turned to where they would get maximum benefit from additional.

01:49.666 --> 01:57.495
And I don't know that it necessarily has to be graduate, or what we call graduate studies nowadays.

01:57.515 --> 02:01.180
That doesn't hurt, of course, and that's beneficial.

02:01.615 --> 02:14.128
but there may be some other things that could be done to enlarge, enhance.

02:16.451 --> 02:20.636
I would be interested in doing something the engineers do.

02:21.957 --> 02:29.445
To what A&M former students or faculty or staff, to what Aggies do you feel greatest gratitude?

02:34.235 --> 02:36.938
To whom do you feel a debt of gratitude?

02:41.743 --> 02:48.830
I suppose that it's those that went before me.

02:49.090 --> 02:50.351
Any particularly in name?

02:55.377 --> 03:00.782
I think for them, all of those

03:01.555 --> 03:25.993
that went before developed an atmosphere, a way of doing things, a tradition if you want to call it that, although that's, I don't know if I put that, put emphasis on the traditions in the way that traditions are normally thought of around here.

03:29.804 --> 03:34.028
Are there some people that helped you that you're really grateful to?

03:36.030 --> 03:37.632
Connected with the university?

03:38.553 --> 03:42.317
As teachers or advisors or buddies?

03:48.063 --> 03:53.208
Well, Mr. Orr helped me to get started.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.810
Mr. Buchanan helped me.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.432
Fred Benson helped me.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.747
Bob Shiller helped me.

04:00.228 --> 04:01.769
Bob Galloway helped me.

04:09.637 --> 04:28.195
I feel a debt of gratitude to all of those teachers that put up with me for four years and passed on engineering thought and wisdom and

04:30.453 --> 04:39.713
of problem solving that I think have stood me in pretty good stead throughout the years.

04:42.258 --> 04:46.588
Unless you think of some things we've left out, I've only got one more question.

04:47.049 --> 04:50.436
Anything we've not talked about that you wanted to be sure to include?

04:50.770 --> 04:52.433
I don't recall anything.

04:52.453 --> 04:58.542
The last question then is, what feelings do you carry in your heart today for Texas A&M?

04:59.123 --> 05:02.027
How do you feel about A&M today, you personally?

05:05.092 --> 05:08.397
I still think it's a fine school.

05:09.519 --> 05:15.748
I still wake up some mornings not really sure that I

05:18.344 --> 05:43.153
got that degree, and I've reached down and feel that if I've still got that ring on my finger, it's a, I guess it's a sense of gratitude for the school, and particularly the people that made up the school, and including the students that were there with me.

05:45.614 --> 05:52.442
The whole experience was one that was, was and is a good thing, I think.

05:53.727 --> 05:54.510
That's splendid.
