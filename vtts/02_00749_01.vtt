WEBVTT

00:01.381 --> 00:07.029
I didn't go to A&M, I went to Texas Lutheran 
instead. Oh, you didn't go? I thought you were

00:07.870 --> 00:09.332
probably an ex. Okay, first of all, Mr. Coon, would 
you tell us something about your early life,

00:11.955 --> 00:28.958
including the names of your parents, the dates of 
their birth and death, if you know them, where they

00:11.955 --> 00:28.958
were born, where you were born, the schools you 
attended before you came to Texas A&M. My father's

00:30.980 --> 00:54.872
name was Victor A. Kuhn and my mother's name was 
Beulah Riggs Kuhn and my father was born February

00:30.980 --> 00:54.872
29th 1872 and he died March 27th 1926.

00:57.395 --> 00:58.557
My mother was born August 25, 1877,

00:59.802 --> 01:29.607
and she died

00:59.802 --> 01:29.607
November 16, 1966.

01:31.932 --> 01:41.124
I'm not certain which county my father was born in, 
but I think it's probably in Victoria County. At

01:42.406 --> 01:48.934
any rate, he was born in Texas, either Victoria or 
Lavaca County. And my mother, I'm quite sure, was

01:50.396 --> 01:58.687
born in Lavaca County, Texas.

01:58.707 --> 01:59.068
What else? You were born when and where? I was born 
near Runge, Texas. That's in Carnes County.

02:09.067 --> 02:10.929
August 14, 1899. And did you go to school in Runge? I 
went to Runge public school and high school. What

02:19.580 --> 02:26.188
factors were involved in your choice of Texas A&M 
as your school or college?

02:32.547 --> 02:52.581
Well, I had heard a good deal about the school and 
the life there, the type of, the fact that it was a

02:32.547 --> 02:52.581
boys' school and living in dormitories. Had there 
been some other boys from Rooney who went there

02:53.658 --> 02:57.622
that you talked to? Yes, there was one that went a 
year or two, several years before I did, Preston

02:58.122 --> 03:04.629
Tom. I think he went there a year or two. But I never 
had discussed it with him. But what you had heard

03:13.037 --> 03:17.401
led you to believe that it would be a pretty good 
place to go. Yes, that's true. Were there any

03:19.443 --> 03:22.686
special procedures you had to go through to to be 
admitted to the school?

03:29.205 --> 03:30.467
I don't recall it. Our school grad certificate of 
graduation, I think, was all I recall.

03:40.958 --> 03:46.083
Did you just appear on the scene in time for 
registration and were accepted then? That's

03:46.424 --> 03:47.004
correct. You didn't have to go through the 
application and acceptance procedure that's in

03:47.024 --> 03:53.111
existence now? No, sir. No, sir. What was your 
first reaction to the school and to College

03:55.573 --> 04:01.179
Station when you arrived there? And you might tell 
us also how you got there. Well, I got there by

04:04.723 --> 04:07.786
train, of course. That's about the only way you 
could get around in those days. Oh, my reaction

04:13.178 --> 04:17.844
was, I guess, about like any other country boy. I 
never had been anyplace except Rung End. It was new

04:24.774 --> 04:26.136
to me. Wasn't any kind of reception committee 
there to meet you? No, I didn't. To be aware, I

04:31.543 --> 04:34.687
didn't see them. OK. How did you get your material 
that you brought with you from the train station to

04:36.055 --> 04:44.946
wherever you were going to stay?

04:47.670 --> 04:51.715
And how were you assigned a place to stay the first 
night, if you recall? I don't recall how we were

04:54.518 --> 04:57.322
assigned. I know where I was assigned to, but I 
don't remember in what way, and I don't remember

04:57.342 --> 05:05.472
how I got my trunk. Well, at one point there was an 
old Negro man by the name of Uncle Dan who had a team

05:06.380 --> 05:18.013
of white mules that he carried baggage from the 
train to the... Could have been, but I don't recall

05:06.380 --> 05:18.013
it.

05:20.836 --> 05:25.441
Did you stay your first night in the dormitory that 
you stayed for the whole first year? Yes,

05:25.461 --> 05:32.168
as far as I can recall, yes, I think so. Would you 
describe, say, a typical day during your four

05:33.380 --> 05:39.247
years there? What time did you get up, and how did 
you wake up, and what hours did you spend in class,

05:40.629 --> 05:52.863
and what hours did you spend doing other things, 
and then what did you do about going to bed? Well, I,

05:54.065 --> 06:00.332
of course, can't remember exactly the hour, but we 
got up At that time, of course, everybody was in the

06:00.717 --> 06:06.584
cadet corps. And we got up by the sound of Reveille 
and we had a few minutes to get out and go through

06:07.885 --> 06:20.920
some calisthenics, the first thing we did. And of 
course we went back and got the rest of our uniform

06:22.622 --> 06:27.568
on. Pretty soon we went to breakfast and we marched 
to all the meals lined up along Military Walk. And

06:36.697 --> 06:56.779
in the evening or noon, I've forgotten, one time a 
day at least, we marched by band music to Mess Hall,

06:36.697 --> 06:56.779
which was down at the end of Military Walk, Sopisa 
Hall, I don't know what it was called. You want to

06:59.273 --> 07:00.134
know what? Just approximately how many hours you 
spent in class in a given day. I don't

07:05.361 --> 07:12.870
remember that for sure. I'd say probably about 
four. And

07:15.193 --> 07:22.582
I would say, what, most of those would be in the 
morning and in the afternoon? Yes, and then in the

07:22.602 --> 07:28.369
afternoon we'd

07:22.602 --> 07:28.369
have laboratory work and some time and we might 
have had some classes in the afternoon but I don't

07:29.041 --> 07:56.500
recall for sure uh what about drill we had drill

07:29.041 --> 07:56.500
several times a week as I remembered but I don't 
remember how many times out on the drill field

07:29.041 --> 07:56.500
close order drill That's out in the field that's 
now in front of the MSC? Yes, that's right. And what

08:03.957 --> 08:06.581
time did you go to bed then? Well, they would blow 
taps for us to go to bed, and best I recall is

08:07.182 --> 08:25.928
somewhere around 10 o'clock, possibly 10.30, I 
don't remember for sure. What was... lifelike in

08:27.800 --> 08:29.542
the dormitory.

08:31.885 --> 08:49.444
Well, once in a while we'd, I was in the basement of 
Milner Hall, the freshmen, most of the freshmen

08:31.885 --> 08:49.444
were in the basement, not all of them. I was in eye 
company and we had a half of the basement of Milner

08:49.464 --> 08:55.731
Hall and K Company had the other half.

09:02.118 --> 09:15.776
And all the various things would happen, like 
sometime during the night they'd throw sacks of

09:02.118 --> 09:15.776
water in on your bed. That's one thing I can 
remember. I don't

09:19.801 --> 09:25.549
remember specifically. Milner Hall was what 
fairly new at the time. Yeah it was fairly new. It

09:31.234 --> 09:36.000
was located as you probably know down near the mess 
hall. How many to a room? Two. And then what both

09:41.166 --> 09:44.270
fish? During your freshman year you were both of 
you in the room were freshmen? Yes my cousin who was

09:47.814 --> 09:54.422
actually my foster brother went with me the first 
year, and we roomed together. Okay.

10:05.089 --> 10:08.433
You mentioned that you lived in Millner your 
freshman year. Do you remember what other

10:08.453 --> 10:11.136
dormitories you lived in? Yes, my sophomore and 
junior year I lived in Leggett Hall, and senior

10:11.156 --> 10:20.687
year I was in Buzell. That was new. That was a new 
building that year and they at that time decided on

10:22.330 --> 10:48.658
a policy of trying to separate the sophomores from 
the freshmen other than those who were corporals

10:22.330 --> 10:48.658
in the company and so they organized two companies 
of sophomores and I had one of them, a fellow named

10:22.330 --> 10:48.658
George captain of the other sophomore company. 
Now, this was which year? My senior year. Your

10:55.602 --> 10:56.363
senior year. Yes. OK. And for that reason, I don't 
know very many of the fellows that were freshmen

10:56.984 --> 11:10.229
the year that I finished, because there weren't 
any freshmen. Well, you had only sophomores in

11:10.249 --> 11:12.333
your company. OK. I noticed you switched from I 
Company to D Company. D Second. D Second. That was

11:21.681 --> 11:30.032
because the enrollment increased to the point 
where they had to form another regiment. And that

11:30.352 --> 11:32.995
caused it. And after two years in D Company, then 
you switched to E Company. Yes. I did that because

11:37.961 --> 11:40.144
that's where they... point it made me captain. Was 
that a fairly common practice, what I was saying,

11:42.760 --> 11:51.249
is taking somebody who had been a sergeant in one 
company and making them a captain in another

11:42.760 --> 11:51.249
company? No, I don't believe it was too common. I 
think one thing it explained at that year is the

11:56.715 --> 12:09.169
fact that, like I said, it was the first time they'd 
had sophomore segregation, you might say, from

11:56.715 --> 12:09.169
freshmen.

12:12.271 --> 12:34.831
In

12:12.271 --> 12:34.831
fact, another thing was the enrollment that year 
had fallen off due to the war and just a few of us that

12:12.271 --> 12:34.831
were in the officer's training camp who were in the 
service at all that were able to get back and go to

12:12.271 --> 12:34.831
school that year. They let

12:34.911 --> 12:41.637
us start in January and run a little bit late, so we 
were not in school, a good many of us, that fall.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.296
That would be the fall of 1918. Right. Okay.

12:56.865 --> 12:58.428
What was the food like in the mess hall? Well, I 
didn't have any complaint about it. Enjoyed it.

13:04.499 --> 13:07.242
Well, I've talked to a number of people who said 
they gained a good bit of weight. Well, yes. I don't

13:08.964 --> 13:12.007
know whether that was altogether due to the food. 
Part of it might have been the regular hours that

13:12.067 --> 13:15.551
you had to keep. Both of them, I think. But I imagine 
you also got a fair amount of physical exercise to

13:18.594 --> 13:24.480
counterbalance the food. Yes. Our drill was 
enough for that. I can't remember just how many

13:29.727 --> 13:34.334
times a week we did it but several times. Was there a 
pretty good variety of food or was it pretty much

13:36.057 --> 13:41.926
the same each week? Well,

13:42.307 --> 13:58.131
I don't recall it being too much the same but I 
really don't have a clear recollection.

13:58.499 --> 14:01.283
very bad, or I think I'd remember it. I think it must 
have been pretty satisfactory. What privileges

14:04.968 --> 14:10.615
did the upperclassmen have that freshmen did not 
enjoy? Well, freshmen didn't enjoy any to speak

14:10.675 --> 14:17.064
of. As I remember it, we were allowed to go to Bryan 
on Saturday afternoon, and I think we had to be back

14:17.244 --> 14:26.717
for supper. As far as I can recall, that's the only 
privilege that we had. If we had any others, I can't

14:33.625 --> 14:36.008
recall. Okay, but what did upperclassmen have 
then? Well,

14:38.812 --> 14:46.121
they could go a little more often, but I don't 
remember just how much. Go a little more often and

14:47.303 --> 14:49.345
stay a little longer sometimes? Stay a little 
longer, yes, sir, but I don't remember the

14:49.365 --> 14:53.751
particulars about that. What kind of duties did 
the freshmen have to perform for the

14:54.322 --> 15:01.950
upperclassmen? Oh, I can't recall the duties, but 
then every once in a while I'd have a little, you'd

15:01.970 --> 15:19.268
bend it on you, you know, this hazing procedure. I 
can't recall them. That's it. If you didn't do

15:22.381 --> 15:24.763
something the way they wanted you to or something? 
Well, no, I don't think it was for any particular

15:25.284 --> 15:28.247
reason. It was just to let you know that you were a 
freshman, I think. I don't recall it. Well, a

15:33.913 --> 15:39.860
couple of people told me that they ran all kinds of 
errands and made beds. I don't recall doing that.

15:43.684 --> 15:47.768
I'm sure some of that was done, but I don't remember 
doing that.

15:51.393 --> 16:02.366
Was there any way that, say, a visitor to the campus 
could distinguish the various classes from each

15:51.393 --> 16:02.366
other? Say, how could you identify a freshman? Or 
was there a way? I don't recall there was any way to

16:07.392 --> 16:19.206
distinguish the classes other than that, to this 
extent, All the corporals at that time were out of

16:20.097 --> 16:39.335
the sophomore class, and all the sergeants and 
first sergeants and so on were junior class, and

16:20.097 --> 16:39.335
all the commissioned officers, lieutenant and 
captain, major and colonel were senior class. If

16:39.355 --> 16:49.024
they didn't, if there were not a, if a private way, I 
don't recall if there was any way you could tell the

16:39.355 --> 16:49.024
difference. But were there a pretty substantial 
number who remained private the whole four years

16:49.932 --> 16:56.881
they were there? There were a few senior privates 
when I was there, yeah. Not many. Do you have any

17:06.112 --> 17:09.817
idea why they never attained a higher rank? Well, I 
assume because they weren't particularly

17:11.359 --> 17:17.847
interested in the military part of it. At that 
time, though, they did have to wear a uniform and

17:18.097 --> 17:22.282
attend drill. But I would imagine, though, since 
all corporals came from the sophomore class, if

17:23.383 --> 17:32.014
you didn't make corporal as a sophomore, you 
didn't have much chance of going up the rank. Well,

17:32.074 --> 17:35.478
I didn't make it as a sophomore. When I was through 
luck, I suppose, I was the first sergeant. So you

17:41.265 --> 17:43.928
skipped the rank of corporal, then. You went 
private to sergeant. That's right. Well, it was

17:48.067 --> 17:57.742
the increase in enrollment that made two 
regiments, which kind of doubled the number of

17:48.067 --> 17:57.742
officers you had to have. Yeah, and then in my 
senior year, the enrollment had dropped some on

17:58.603 --> 18:08.218
account of the war.

18:12.890 --> 18:16.573
What did the students do for entertainment and 
recreation? I mean, how'd they occupy their time

18:16.594 --> 18:21.518
when they weren't in class or drilling or anything 
of that nature?

18:24.201 --> 18:24.601
Did you? Well, one thing we'd sometimes do for 
recreation, there was what they called a fish pond

18:26.463 --> 18:39.235
about, I suppose it was a couple of miles

18:45.020 --> 18:46.322
I guess it would be west. It was a pretty good-sized 
pond of water, and we'd go out there swimming. This

18:55.378 --> 18:58.964
would have been then probably across the railroad 
tracks from the school. Yes, it was in the

18:58.984 --> 19:04.714
direction of the railroad station on out. I 
believe that would have been to the west, the best I

19:05.475 --> 19:09.542
remember. At one point, this was probably later, I 
guess, because there was a pond out there that was

19:10.906 --> 19:25.628
part of the sewage treatment plant, I think, that 
Mr. Giesecke had designed. Do

19:25.668 --> 19:30.435
you know where Eastwood Airport is? No, I don't. 
Okay. All right. Well, I don't imagine it's the

19:34.781 --> 19:40.710
same thing, because you wouldn't have been 
swimming in that unless they had... the lake and

19:40.927 --> 19:44.652
later converted it to part of their sewage 
treatment. Well that's possible.

19:54.164 --> 19:59.671
Were there any things besides swimming did you 
have anything to do at the YMCA? No

19:59.731 --> 20:05.158
I never did. I don't know I don't remember whether 
there was any recreation There was a YMCA there at

20:11.116 --> 20:16.263
the time, but I don't remember whether it was any 
recreation. At one point, there was a swimming

20:16.363 --> 20:20.128
pool in the basement of the YMCA. If there was when I 
was there, I don't remember. Did you participate

20:26.476 --> 20:29.700
in any of the intramural athletics? Oh, I played 
just a little bit of baseball, but very little. I

20:35.789 --> 20:36.850
wasn't too hot. Were there a pretty substantial 
percentage of the fellows who played baseball?

20:41.221 --> 20:45.305
any intramural sports? Yes, I think a big percent 
of them did. I gather it was a fairly competitive,

20:50.031 --> 20:57.159
highly competitive

20:50.031 --> 20:57.159
sort of thing, was it not? Yes, it was. I say that 
because I've seen in some of the annuals where

21:00.582 --> 21:07.650
people have been listed, they were part of the 
championship basketball team, so it seems to have

21:07.833 --> 21:13.720
been somewhat of an honor to have been on the 
championship team. Did you have any favorite

21:16.284 --> 21:18.587
teachers while you were there? If you can remember 
who they were and why you liked them.

21:28.519 --> 21:33.165
We're getting back too far.

21:37.735 --> 21:40.283
I can't recall any in particular. Okay. I was 
wondering, a couple of the people I've talked to, I

21:41.406 --> 21:45.760
noticed you were in chemical engineering. Well, I 
was like Dr. Hedges, who was the head of the

21:51.472 --> 22:20.263
department at the time quite well but he didn't 
actually teach me he was primarily

21:51.472 --> 22:20.263
administration that's correct now what I was 
getting at in chemical engineering did you take a

21:51.472 --> 22:20.263
fair amount of chemistry courses in addition to 
that a couple people that I've talked to have not

21:51.472 --> 22:20.263
been particularly fond of the chemistry 
department because I think that was kind of the

21:51.472 --> 22:20.263
average attitude of most of them A goodly number of 
people busted freshman chemistry. Yes, that's

22:25.327 --> 22:26.289
true. Must have been a pretty tough one. What was 
the attitude of the students toward the

22:30.575 --> 22:33.458
administration? And I guess there would really 
be, as I understand it, a dual administration

22:33.478 --> 22:40.868
role. One, the president's office that sort of 
handled the education end, and the commandant's

22:41.049 --> 22:47.477
office that did the military end. That's true.

22:52.137 --> 22:56.522
Well, as far as I know, the attitude of the students 
was good. I don't recall any... Do you ever have any

22:56.662 --> 23:03.730
contact with, I believe, Dr. Bezell? Yes, he was 
president at the time. Was he fairly open to the

23:06.573 --> 23:11.718
students? I mean, if you had a problem, could you go 
see him about it? Well, I suppose that you could. I

23:16.343 --> 23:20.107
never did, but I assume that you could. I don't... I 
didn't have any occasions.

23:27.183 --> 23:38.118
One of the things that is of interest to us at 
present time is the number of the traditions and

23:27.183 --> 23:38.118
customs that exist at Texas A&M. And we have some 
difficulty pinpointing when things started and

23:39.480 --> 23:45.829
things of that nature. Can you remember anything 
new that was started while you were there? No,

23:52.398 --> 24:00.909
sir, I don't believe I can recall anything. Did you 
have a campus muster on April 21st? I can't recall

24:03.733 --> 24:08.019
that we did. We used to have Yale practice, I know, 
for... For ball games? Ball games, yeah. Midnight

24:15.368 --> 24:16.750
Yale practices, sir. Well, no, they were long in 
the evening. After

24:21.760 --> 24:27.165
supper sometime. Between supper and the quiet 
study hour. Study hour, yeah. Were there any girls

24:32.870 --> 24:35.953
in any of the classes you attended?

24:39.276 --> 24:44.501
I ask that because we know that at various and 
sundry times there were a few girls. I was thinking

24:44.521 --> 24:50.026
there might have been... Because this is the whole 
thing. The people in the cities... I'm not sure

24:52.608 --> 25:09.930
whether they were in my classes, but I think I can 
recall there were one or two girls that they were

24:52.608 --> 25:09.930
either daughters of professors or lived at Bryan, 
something like that, but there were very few. I

25:11.032 --> 25:20.404
don't recall for sure whether there was any in one 
of my classes, but I believe there were two or three

25:11.032 --> 25:20.404
there in the school at that time. Earlier, when we 
were talking about entertainment, about

25:22.747 --> 25:30.156
privileges, you mentioned about going to Bryan. 
Yes. Was that on the, what was it called, the

25:32.899 --> 25:35.502
Tunerville Trolley? Yeah, that was an interurban 
car that ran by. What, for what purposes did the

25:41.048 --> 25:44.893
students go to Bryan? Oh, just to, not anything in 
particular, just to go to town. There was, I take it

25:51.795 --> 26:00.007
then, really nothing as far as the town of College 
Station was concerned. No stores, at least very

26:00.888 --> 26:03.071
few. There were a few out on the fringes there, but 
not many. Sort of in that area behind Speza? I

26:12.004 --> 26:19.855
believe, yes, yeah.

26:22.366 --> 26:26.149
So it was just a matter of getting off the campus for 
a little while. That was about all there was to it,

26:26.209 --> 26:31.534
the best I remember. We know that a substantial 
percentage of the boys who went to A&M worked

26:31.554 --> 26:38.300
part-time while they were there. Did you have any 
time of employment? I did. In my freshman year, I

26:41.162 --> 26:48.749
worked as a janitor some. But after that, I didn't 
work anymore. About how much time did you put in

26:52.353 --> 26:54.756
working? Oh, maybe uh...

27:00.925 --> 27:02.167
I don't remember for sure. Maybe an hour a day or... 
How much did you get an hour? Do you remember? No, I

27:06.594 --> 27:10.039
don't have any recollection of that. Seems like 
for a good long while the standard wages I believe

27:10.059 --> 27:14.064
were 25 cents an hour. Well, I wouldn't be 
surprised. I know at that time wages in general

27:15.527 --> 27:22.056
were not very high.

27:22.525 --> 27:38.664
Did the students who participated in regular 
intercollegiate athletics, like football,

27:22.525 --> 27:38.664
basketball, and baseball, have any privileges 
that the other students didn't have? You mean

27:39.645 --> 27:40.967
intramural? No, I mean who played on the college 
team. Yes, I think they did. I know they had a

27:46.693 --> 27:49.857
training table. They ate at a... what they call a 
training table together, you know. Well, it was on

27:58.238 --> 28:11.695
the football squad, and I don't remember for 
certain about the other sports, but I think

27:58.238 --> 28:11.695
possibly so, but I know the football, being made 
together.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.544
But did they stay with their regular company then? 
Best I can remember, yes. I think then each

28:22.448 --> 28:29.597
dormitory was sort of assigned to companies. 
That's right. Depending upon the size, there'd be

28:30.618 --> 28:33.682
one or more companies in a dormitory. That's true. 
That's right.

28:43.254 --> 28:50.363
Earlier you mentioned that part of what was your 
senior year, the fall of 1918, You were not on

28:50.630 --> 28:52.352
campus, actually. You were in Officer's Training 
School. Where was that? That was near Waco, Camp

28:56.699 --> 29:00.464
MacArthur. I don't think it's in existence any 
longer. Okay, so... It was just a tent. We lived in

29:09.477 --> 29:10.598
tents. Did you go there immediately after the end 
of your junior year? No. We first went... for a

29:21.089 --> 29:26.154
month at Fort Sheridan in the ROTC program. That's 
in Illinois. That would have been in June? Yes, in

29:30.899 --> 29:31.961
June. And then while we were there, about

29:32.021 --> 29:50.320
the time that month was up, they offered us a 
two-month

29:32.021 --> 29:50.320
enlistment for an additional a training camp

29:51.650 --> 30:20.948
at that same location other than the ROTC camp and 
some of us stayed and some of them got commissions

29:51.650 --> 30:20.948
from that but I did not and I went on back at the end of 
that two months to school and we enlisted there in

29:51.650 --> 30:20.948
the what was then called the SATC and I stayed there 
at school possibly a week, and we were then, most of

30:21.215 --> 30:27.831
us, sent to camp back out there. And this SATC stood 
for what? Student Army Training Corps, I believe.
