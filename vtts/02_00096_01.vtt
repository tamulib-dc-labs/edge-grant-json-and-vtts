WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:02.850
ABC. Testing, testing, one, two, three, one, two, 
three. This is Thursday, May 25th, or 6th.

00:13.064 --> 00:15.307
Haskell, I think it's the 23rd, isn't it? I don't 
know. Yeah, it's the 23rd. Anyway, we're in

00:18.611 --> 00:25.219
Austin, and I have the pleasure and honor of 
interviewing Hector Gutierrez. Hector, to

00:26.441 --> 00:31.067
introduce yourself to this tape and anyone who 
might... read the typed version, describe your

00:31.283 --> 00:37.334
biography before you came to A&M. Family, where, 
when, where'd you go to high school and all that? I

00:42.082 --> 00:45.588
grew up in a family of five children. I was the 
oldest child. Considered my family working

00:49.255 --> 00:53.802
class, middle class family. Went to high school at 
Martin High School, which is the only high school

00:55.665 --> 01:04.039
in Laredo, until my senior year, which is when we 
built our second high school. That high school was

01:04.419 --> 01:05.702
named J.W. Nixon. after the superintendent of 
schools and we were the first graduating class of

01:06.603 --> 01:13.276
Nixon. How many in your class? We had about 600 
people in my class. I was elected student body

01:18.166 --> 01:28.527
president my senior year and I was also head of the 
ROTC and had the privilege of of receiving the

01:28.507 --> 01:33.473
valedictory honors at the end of my senior year. 
What did your family do for income? My father was a

01:36.817 --> 01:38.399
car salesman. My mother was a GS-6 at the Air Force 
Base, so they were both working parents. I might

01:50.194 --> 01:52.236
say that my grandfather Teodosio was one of the 
leaders of, I guess, in the business movement in

01:52.857 --> 02:05.299
Laredo that involved, what I would say, 
Hispanics. Even Laredo, which is 95% Hispanic,

02:05.319 --> 02:16.418
didn't have really any leaders that the community 
saw as business leaders, and Teodosio was in that

02:05.319 --> 02:16.418
category. When he died, he was probably, I'd say, 
in the top 10 of wealth in Laredo. So my father grew

02:23.407 --> 02:25.330
up in a very wealthy family. The house where they 
lived is a historic home. It's a mansion. His

02:32.361 --> 02:34.885
sister still lives in that house. And so my father 
came from a lot of wealth, but my grandfather died

02:35.025 --> 02:40.193
very young. And as a result of that early death at 
age 49, My father and his brothers weren't able to

02:44.950 --> 02:49.194
manage the money. They had cotton gins. They had a 
lot of the land where Tony Sanchez has discovered

02:50.154 --> 03:00.143
his oil and gas was my grandfather's land, but they 
sold the mineral rights. When did your family get

03:00.523 --> 03:03.046
to the Laredo area? My grandfather came to Texas 
from Guerrero, which is where Lake Falcon is. He

03:12.874 --> 03:13.995
crossed border when he was seven years old with the 
current mayor's, mayor of Austin's father, Gus

03:14.532 --> 03:21.340
Garcia. Gus Garcia's dad and my grandfather 
crossed at the same time and Zapata and that was

03:21.741 --> 03:33.315
when he was six and he died when he was 49. So it was, 
you know, the early 1900s,

03:33.515 --> 03:39.482
late 1800s. Okay. Why did you go to A&M?

03:45.937 --> 03:48.362
I always wanted to be an Aggie. Well,

03:48.382 --> 04:02.028
first of all, I felt always that I was going to serve 
my country somehow, that I was going to have to go

03:48.382 --> 04:02.028
into the military somehow. Excuse me one second. 
I'm getting up paid. Why you attended A&M? Where

04:08.465 --> 04:11.168
did you hear about it, and what had you heard about 
it? Well, I, this is a very, I remember going to a

04:11.188 --> 04:33.696
family's home, and on their mantle were pictures 
of these two young men in uniform, and I asked, it

04:11.188 --> 04:33.696
was my younger brother's godparents, and it was 
Gus and Lua Fernandez. And one of the pictures on

04:33.980 --> 04:40.312
the mantle was Raul Fernandez, and it was when he 
was at A&M. And I always asked, why is he in uniform?

04:43.278 --> 04:47.787
And these godparents of my younger brother would 
tell me about A&M. And this handsome, sharp young

04:48.205 --> 04:58.403
man and his brother, I don't know whether his 
brother was in an army uniform or whether he was an

04:48.205 --> 04:58.403
Aggie as well, but that influenced me. And I 
figured, you know, there were other families that

04:58.724 --> 05:07.118
I knew had children that had gone to A&M. And I 
figured if I went into the military, I wanted to be

05:08.301 --> 05:12.508
an officer. And I, of course, I was an ROTC in high 
school. These were, you know, the late 60s, and,

05:17.447 --> 05:29.350
you know, we had the Cuban Missile Crisis, we had 
the Cold War, we had, you know, the aftermath of the

05:17.447 --> 05:29.350
Korean War, and we had Vietnam. I felt if I was going 
to serve my country, I wanted to be an officer and go

05:29.768 --> 05:36.483
to a school that afforded me the opportunity to... 
But no older brother or first cousin? Nobody. In

05:39.570 --> 05:46.506
fact, all of my family, all my cousins, all my 
brothers and sisters are all Longhorns. I'm the

05:47.348 --> 05:48.891
only Aggie in the family. All right. Now, among 
your siblings, you're which one? I'm the oldest.

05:52.797 --> 05:53.278
You're the oldest. So, all right. So, you're, are 
you the first in your family tree to go to college?

05:58.005 --> 05:58.246
Yes. Mom and dad didn't? My mother and father did 
not. Now, my brother had, I mean, my father had two

06:00.329 --> 06:04.535
brothers that went to Wharton. So, so that, that 
tells you a little bit about the family he came from

06:04.716 --> 06:10.845
and... Did you understand growing up that you were 
going to go to college? Definitely. How can they do

06:17.684 --> 06:19.452
that? I knew it would be hard because I knew that I 
would have to probably work to get myself through

06:20.393 --> 06:25.659
college. I worked summers at Sears during high 
school, but my father, on his selling car

06:25.679 --> 06:36.490
salaries,

06:25.679 --> 06:36.490
put me through college. I didn't have to work 
through college. When did you first visit A&M and

06:38.793 --> 06:41.716
what was your impression of it? The first time I 
visited A&M was the day I was dropped off. Oh,

06:46.101 --> 06:46.461
really? And had my trunk in Did A&M do anything to 
recruit you? No. You applied. I applied and I think

06:52.185 --> 07:05.543
another influencer for me was that a lot of my 
friends that were going to college and, you know, I

06:52.185 --> 07:05.543
was pretty studious but I was also active in 
extracurricular activities. A lot of the kids

07:06.024 --> 07:10.650
that were going to college from Nixon, that first 
graduating class, happened to be going to A&M, and

07:10.850 --> 07:14.735
so we all went to A&M together. And when we started 
applying, we applied together, and we compared

07:15.336 --> 07:23.446
letters of acceptance with each other. And I 
believe you said before we turned the machine on of

07:23.506 --> 07:29.154
your high school record, summarize that. I think 
in my high school class, I was very active always

07:34.357 --> 07:44.013
politically with student council and was either 
in junior high I was president of student council

07:34.357 --> 07:44.013
and senior high school I was president of student 
council. I was also head of the ROTC. I don't know

07:47.279 --> 07:55.993
whether I stated it while I was on record or not, but 
the valedictorian was... Did you get a little

07:47.279 --> 07:55.993
scholarship as a... I got, I think, about a $1,000 
scholarship, which was a lot back then. Oh, yeah.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.202
And I was also the most popular boy. So I wasn't 
totally a nerd by being valedictorian. I was most

08:07.807 --> 08:09.008
popular as well. Right. So when you went up to A&M to 
enroll in the fall of 1968. No, the fall of 65. It was

08:17.799 --> 08:22.085
the first year that the Corps was non-compulsory. 
How did you get there? When you went up there, who

08:25.032 --> 08:26.375
took you? I went with a friend of mine. My parents 
didn't take me up there. I went with a friend who had

08:30.203 --> 08:32.147
a car. And what did you take in that, what stuff? You 
know, the main thing I took, I took a couple of, I

08:38.330 --> 08:59.221
remember I took some books, I took obviously 
casual clothes, my mother's cookies, some, I

08:38.330 --> 08:59.221
remember I put a lot of salsa, cans of salsa in my 
footlocker. But I got there not knowing what

08:59.702 --> 09:03.848
outfit I was going to be in. what dorm I was going to 
be in. And the first night, there were five Aggies

09:06.556 --> 09:09.855
that arrived. And five of us went up in the car, and 
how we got that stuff in the car, I don't know. But we

09:17.015 --> 09:30.938
were all afraid to spend the night in our own room, 
so we decided that we'd go stay with an individual

09:17.015 --> 09:30.938
by the name of Doug Kennedy, who happened to be in 
the jock dorm, and those dorms were

09:17.015 --> 09:30.938
air-conditioned. Ours were not. So five young 
men... stayed in the same room on two beds, one on

09:34.844 --> 09:43.620
the floor, two of us on each of the single beds, you 
know. Was this in Henderson Hall? Yes, it was

09:45.984 --> 09:47.327
Henderson Hall. All right. Exactly. Then you go 
back. How were you received? Well, Haskell, I'll

09:53.963 --> 09:59.009
tell a funny story that I got to my outfit. I was in 
Squadron 9, and there was an individual by the name

09:59.029 --> 10:04.456
of Chapeau was his last name. He was a senior. He was 
our commander, and I never thought I'd forget his

10:05.818 --> 10:20.376
first name, but at this moment, I'm having trouble 
recollecting his first name, but he was from San

10:05.818 --> 10:20.376
Francisco, and he was taking aerospace 
engineering, and He introduced himself to me. He

10:25.273 --> 10:33.144
was in his senior boots and I was carrying a 
footlocker and he asked me if I knew how to whip out.

10:35.086 --> 10:41.115
And I looked at him and I said, of course I do. He 
said, well, do it. and i was with a bunch of friends

10:46.428 --> 11:08.284
and he was with a bunch of seniors and i said not here 
i

10:46.428 --> 11:08.284
obviously did not know what whipping out was and it 
had a different connotation with me than it had

10:46.428 --> 11:08.284
with him but i of course everybody started 
laughing and I'm sort of embarrassed telling that

11:08.264 --> 11:12.433
story, but that was my first introduction. He 
asked me if I knew how to whip out, and I said, of

11:12.473 --> 11:18.225
course, but not in the hallway and not in the 
presence of other people. Did he give you any kind

11:18.245 --> 11:20.210
of lecture or anything? He showed me how to whip 
out. Oh, okay. He said, let me show you how to whip

11:22.014 --> 11:28.247
out, and at that point, I started backing away 
and... He put out his hand, and he stated his name,

11:28.227 --> 11:41.733
and he told me where he was from, and he said, my name 
is Chapo, I'm from San Francisco, and I'm taking

11:28.227 --> 11:41.733
aerospace engineering, and your name is 
Gutierrez, and you're from Laredo, and you're

11:28.227 --> 11:41.733
taking mathematics. And he said, that's whipping 
out. And so... Do you have any idea how you got

11:45.119 --> 11:48.587
assigned to the unit you got assigned? No idea. I 
knew I was going to be in an Air Force unit and at that

11:49.429 --> 11:58.449
time there were no, you couldn't lobby to be in 
certain units like you do now. In fact, it was all

11:58.549 --> 11:59.952
random. You didn't know how you were picked or how 
you were selected to go into certain units. All

12:04.660 --> 12:10.628
right, describe then you and your new roommate 
moving into your quarters. My first roommate was

12:11.148 --> 12:29.993
Michael Yodite, who was J-O-D-E-I-T, Michael, 
and he was from Houston, Texas, and he was sort of,

12:11.148 --> 12:29.993
you know, about a foot and a half taller than I was. 
He had probably never met a Hispanic in his life,

12:29.973 --> 12:39.042
and we were rooming together, and we became the 
best of friends, and... How quickly? Very

12:40.663 --> 12:51.995
quickly, but at the end of my, at the end of his first 
semester, he ended up going to room with another

12:40.663 --> 12:51.995
person, then I had a second roommate whose name was 
Frank Davis. He was also from, from the Houston

12:52.035 --> 12:55.558
area. Describe what y'all had in that room that 
fall. Describe the furnishings. The main thing we

13:01.718 --> 13:06.084
had was two desks, two beds, a bunk bed. Who slept up 
and who down? I slept up and he slept down. Why? He

13:11.570 --> 13:16.035
slept because he was so tall he was afraid his feet 
would hang out too. I told him, I said, Michael,

13:16.435 --> 13:22.963
your feet will hang out on the first bunk too, but he 
was so tall that he thought that that it'd be better

13:23.483 --> 13:27.810
for the short guy to be on top, and it was more 
hassle. Did you have any radio typewriter or

13:27.830 --> 13:31.476
anything like that? I had a radio. I wasn't able to 
have a record player, and it was a turntable record

13:34.441 --> 13:39.990
player, until my sophomore year. Very Spartan. We 
had a sink in our room and, you know, learned how to

13:44.185 --> 13:54.479
put together uniform and learn how to shine shoes 
pretty quickly. Who gave you any, you and your

13:54.780 --> 14:05.134
buddies who were fish, who gave y'all the training 
about Aggie traditions and how to do and not to do

13:54.780 --> 14:05.134
things in the dorm? The main training came from, 
quite frankly, the sophomores. We didn't, I mean,

14:12.314 --> 14:24.107
prior to my going to A&M, I had no mentor prior to my 
going to A&M that told me what it was like or that

14:12.314 --> 14:24.107
even gave me a clue of what it was like. When I was in 
high school, I concentrated on high school. I was

14:28.092 --> 14:34.159
totally consuming, and I didn't have any idea of 
what A&M looked like. where

14:34.139 --> 14:50.527
the dorms were, the kind of training we would have, 
how ROTC at Texas A&M would greatly differ from

14:34.139 --> 14:50.527
that which we got, you know, as a course study in a 
high school. So it was a world unknown to me. I did

14:54.254 --> 14:56.738
not realize how competitive everything would be. 
Even though we were a freshman class, within the

14:59.716 --> 15:03.805
class there was competition. Competition, in my 
opinion, to be the best drilled, to be the best

15:03.905 --> 15:14.387
educated freshman. Did your outfit have a 
nickname? Hellcat 9. Hellcat 9. And did a motto or

15:18.594 --> 15:21.477
anything like that? I don't recall a motto, but we 
were known, you know, Hellcat 9 was known as, you

15:21.497 --> 15:28.446
know, a bunch of hell raisers. And it was also the 
outfit in the Air Force that was known for hazing

15:28.486 --> 15:37.697
more than any other Air Force outfit. How soon did 
you get hazed? You had to sign hazing however you

15:40.100 --> 15:43.144
want to. I define hazing as, in the very loose sense 
of the word, hazing to me was having to do push-ups,

15:43.124 --> 15:59.228
having to do sit-ups, having to do chores for the 
upperclassmen like shine their shoes. And that

15:59.248 --> 16:00.991
began, all that began when? The very first hour 
that I was there. it kept me in shape. I'd never been

16:06.718 --> 16:08.761
in better shape in all my life. Hazing to me was 
running. It wasn't, it wasn't defined in my mind at

16:11.264 --> 16:26.143
that point as acts of demoralizing a human being or 
demonizing a person. I never got hit by a board, but

16:27.445 --> 16:31.390
I never, I never was hit by a board. I did a lot of 
pushups, I did a lot of sit-ups, and I did a lot of

16:35.193 --> 16:42.283
running for the mistakes that I made. Were there 
cush questions in the chow hall? Yes. Do you

16:47.631 --> 16:50.796
remember any of, do you have any favorite cush 
questions? know, ask, there are certain things in

16:50.978 --> 17:16.027
my life that I remember vividly, but the Cush 
questions were, I mean, obviously, you know,

16:50.978 --> 17:16.027
they'd ask us campusology, and we had, you know, we 
had,

16:50.978 --> 17:16.027
we had to answer questions correctly, and... All 
right, let me share it with you, my favorite one

16:50.978 --> 17:16.027
that I've learned, and you can use this perhaps in 
some of your service activities at that big dome

16:50.978 --> 17:16.027
building. How many stars are there in the Texas 
flag? No, there's two. There's one on each side.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.405
And if they say two, you say, no, there's one. It 
goes through both ways. You can't win. That's

17:28.990 --> 17:29.430
right. That's right. In other words, the 
upperclassmen would get the kush no matter what.

17:34.377 --> 17:34.837
That's right. In the dining hall lingo, what were 
some of your favorite food nicknames? Well, to me,

17:42.717 --> 17:55.257
it was the bull neck was meat, and of course

17:42.717 --> 17:55.257
spuds were the potatoes, and buckshot were peas.

17:57.942 --> 18:01.708
You know, the cow was milk, and I don't remember 
what water was. Was tea horse?

18:06.636 --> 18:08.539
Because wasn't it, it was some animal, wasn't it? 
Tea was, I don't know whether tea was horse or not,

18:08.941 --> 18:13.867
but I know that... What was ice cream? I don't know 
that one.

18:18.453 --> 18:19.834
And all desserts were cush? All desserts were 
cush. There was no... Bread was deal? Deal.

18:27.384 --> 18:27.684
Let's see. Mustard was baby? Mustard was baby. And 
I won't repeat what mayonnaise was. Yeah, yeah,

18:34.412 --> 18:37.436
yeah. The... How soon was it before the 
upperclassmen whipped you fish into training,

18:39.215 --> 18:48.528
where you fell in, you marched, you did this, that, 
and the other? The first week. I mean, they, you

18:50.771 --> 18:53.434
know, I didn't know anything. Well, I knew a lot 
about marching because I was in ROTC, and I was head

18:53.454 --> 18:59.923
of the ROTC, and so I was pretty good at marching. 
But I tell you Haskell, I didn't want to show that

19:03.101 --> 19:12.335
off because you didn't want to stand out too much 
too quickly, okay? And so I learned to march with

19:13.337 --> 19:17.182
everybody else. I didn't want to display the fact 
that I was a Nazi. And in your era, Did the fall

19:25.655 --> 19:28.078
semester begin in late September? It began in 
mid-September. Mid-September. Mid-September.

19:31.182 --> 19:34.926
And we went after Christmas to finish the 
semester. That is correct. That is correct. Were

19:36.688 --> 19:38.310
Saturday classes still being held? Yes. Okay. I 
didn't have too many Saturday, but we did have

19:39.632 --> 19:41.995
Saturday classes. And your major was math? My 
major is mathematics. Describe enrolling that

19:44.959 --> 19:47.802
first semester. Did you stand in line over at... 
Stood in a long line. It took about I would say, no

19:53.583 --> 19:59.035
exaggeration, two hours to get my classes. I mean, 
just, it was, the procedures to get a course of

19:59.075 --> 20:07.153
study were very, in my opinion, it was almost like 
harassment. It wasn't very organized. I had to go

20:11.280 --> 20:14.484
to too many different places to get a class 
schedule. You would have thought it would have all

20:14.544 --> 20:21.312
been done in a central location, but I had to go to 
several different places to enroll. All right,

20:21.472 --> 20:26.218
describe going to class as a beginning freshman. 
Going to class as a beginning freshman was a

20:27.119 --> 20:35.790
terrifying experience because on the way to that 
class, you would meet you'd have to pass

20:35.770 --> 20:44.223
upperclassmen, or you would see upperclassmen 
that you knew, and you would have to call them by

20:35.770 --> 20:44.223
name. And so you were always on, you know, pins and 
needles. You always scouted at least a block ahead

20:51.093 --> 20:57.002
to take the path of least, least resistance, 
obviously, to get to the course on time, but to

20:57.218 --> 21:05.245
avoid where people were because then you'd have to 
say hello to those upperclassmen. And you were

21:05.265 --> 21:07.027
living in which dorm area? I was living in the core 
area in dorm six my first year, and then in dorm four

21:07.107 --> 21:20.058
my second year, and then I went to core staff my last 
two years, dorm two. That first semester, did you

21:20.238 --> 21:25.403
have any courses that ended up being important to 
you later? Describe those and why. The first, the

21:27.749 --> 21:41.805
most important one that I took that first year was I 
was in the honors program and I took a course on

21:27.749 --> 21:41.805
great books and the great books of the world and it 
was in that course that I met a lot of my current

21:41.785 --> 21:56.866
friends, people like Wayne Prescott and Kent 
Caperton, Mark Caperton, excuse me, Mark

21:41.785 --> 21:56.866
Caperton, Kent's brother. They were in that 
class, and it was the one class where I met a lot of

21:57.808 --> 22:09.885
the leadership of the civilian student body, and 
that course shaped a lot of my thinking for how I was

22:09.865 --> 22:13.690
going to act in later years at A&M. I didn't realize 
it at the time, but those people that were in that

22:13.770 --> 22:25.205
class as freshmen, for some reason, I guess people 
in the honors program tend to be leaders. They were

22:26.787 --> 22:34.877
the leaders on the civilian side of... Was the 
instructor in that honors course important? His

22:35.178 --> 22:37.564
name was Dr. Abbott, and I'll never forget. John 
Paul Abbott. Make believe I didn't know him.

22:40.612 --> 22:41.334
Describe him. He was a,

22:42.316 --> 22:49.896
to me, if I were going to draw a professor, you know, 
close my eyes and draw a professor, I would draw him

22:50.197 --> 22:54.523
like Dr. Abbott. He was, you know, he had glasses 
and he had beautiful white hair. When he spoke to

23:01.493 --> 23:08.582
you, his glasses would go down on his nose and he'd 
peer and look at you over those glasses. He was a

23:08.642 --> 23:13.369
very kind and gentle man, yet very uh i mean in his 
disposition but extremely demanding and what he

23:13.805 --> 23:33.990
expected you to produce as far as analysis of the 
books i remember studying job with him the book of

23:13.805 --> 23:33.990
job was one of the books we studied and the way the 
way he taught that book was completely different

23:34.477 --> 23:38.569
than anything I'd ever learned in a Catholic 
church. And so he was, he made a great, great

23:39.732 --> 23:44.365
impression. That was Dr. Skravanek. was another 
one because I decided to minor in Russian in

23:46.778 --> 24:05.628
college because I already knew Spanish and I 
wanted to learn another language and this was

23:46.778 --> 24:05.628
again during the Cold War and I thought why not 
know, why not get to know the language of the enemy

23:46.778 --> 24:05.628
and so I decided to learn Russian and I was very good 
at Russian. I had a straight, I had a 4.0 grade point

24:05.648 --> 24:09.213
in Russian. I never made anything less than an A and 
I If I'd taken like six more hours, I think I would

24:14.622 --> 24:17.728
have had a double major. I would have had a major in 
Russian as well. What about your first math

24:20.152 --> 24:22.837
courses since that was your major? First math 
courses were, you know, advanced algebra and

24:23.598 --> 24:33.255
calculus.

24:33.758 --> 24:37.224
I took a lot of math courses, and I did very great in 
math until I got to the theory. I was better in the

24:38.006 --> 24:52.231
application portions and the formula portions of 
math than I was in the proving theorems and getting

24:38.006 --> 24:52.231
into the deep analysis of differential 
equations, you know. What were your personal

24:52.251 --> 24:57.100
guidelines about going to class, behavior, 
study, and all that? My freshman and sophomore

24:58.902 --> 25:05.418
year was to maximize my grades, to get the best 
grades I possibly could. Did you go every day to

25:05.438 --> 25:06.821
class? I never missed a class that I can... Where 
did you sit? I always sat in the back of the room on

25:10.992 --> 25:13.137
the right-hand side. Why? so I could observe what 
was going on in front of me and know what, to this

25:14.410 --> 25:34.768
day, when I go into a hearing, I sit in the very back 
of the room so I can observe everything that's

25:14.410 --> 25:34.768
going on, who's there, who's paying attention, 
who's not paying attention, and also be close to

25:14.410 --> 25:34.768
the exit. Did you ever go to sleep in class? I can't, 
never, never that I can recall. I was tired, I'm

25:43.047 --> 25:45.953
sure, but I can't ever recall falling asleep in 
class. And you and your buddies, what were your

25:46.675 --> 25:52.107
study routines? My study routines were in between 
classes, Haskell, I would go to library, and I had

25:56.480 --> 26:08.173
a, you know, I'd go to the stacks and hide, so nobody 
would see me, and I'd avoid upperclassmen, and so I

25:56.480 --> 26:08.173
would find a quiet place in the library to study. 
Where was your special place? I used to go to, like,

26:10.556 --> 26:22.149
the fourth floor, fourth, fourth stacks, where I, 
you know, close to a window, you know, so I could

26:10.556 --> 26:22.149
look out, and, but, but very few people went up 
there, I mean, but. And nobody was bothered in the

26:22.169 --> 26:24.411
library, were they? Nobody bothered me in the 
library. Where were the other interference-free

26:26.808 --> 26:31.115
areas? The only other interference-free area 
that I found was in the men's restroom where there

26:31.556 --> 26:47.682
were lots of stalls and you could shut the stall and 
study in there and nobody would would bother you

26:48.033 --> 27:13.905
and so I I'd find a restroom and I'd sit there 
sometimes for 30 minutes reading a book or sounds

26:48.033 --> 27:13.905
crazy but I knew that with that door shut nobody 
nobody would bother me it was quiet now in the MSC

26:48.033 --> 27:13.905
y'all weren't hazed though were you we weren't 
hazing the MSC but there was there was there was too

26:48.033 --> 27:13.905
much activity and too much distraction I'd also go 
to the At night, I used to go to the Bermuda Inn and

27:15.235 --> 27:22.282
get a cup of coffee and sometimes spend an hour 
there. How would you get over there? I'm now

27:25.726 --> 27:31.111
advancing to the end of my sophomore year. Junior 
year, I got a car and I would drive there. But your

27:34.395 --> 27:35.956
freshman year, you didn't have wheels? No. Let's 
see. In your freshman year, where did you and your

27:39.340 --> 27:43.504
buddies play, relax? The main place that we would 
relax would be at the MSC. That pretty much was, or

27:52.520 --> 27:59.991
we'd relax by going running anywhere but the 
quadrangle area. So we'd go run. On the campus

28:02.235 --> 28:02.755
though? On the campus and other parts of the 
campus. You know where that golf course was? The

28:06.881 --> 28:07.763
golf course was there. What did you wear when you 
ran? Shorts? Shorts, yes.

28:14.821 --> 28:24.330
We always, our outfit had certain color shorts and 
we'd wear those shorts and wear that and a t-shirt

28:14.821 --> 28:24.330
and we'd take off the t-shirt if it was too warm. In 
your freshman year or so, was there anybody to whom

28:24.350 --> 28:28.874
you turned for academic advice?

28:31.697 --> 28:32.938
Not in my outfit, there was not. No, but I mean any 
teacher, advisor, assistant dean? No. How soon

28:39.724 --> 28:44.068
was it before you got involved in some pranks, some 
good bull, some Immediately. I mean, you know, as a

28:47.396 --> 28:53.543
class we were always trying to harass the 
upperclassmen. Give some examples of fish

28:54.043 --> 28:56.926
pranks. One of the fish pranks that, one example 
would be is that those of us that had a car, and I

28:57.587 --> 29:12.604
didn't have one my freshman year as mentioned 
earlier, but we'd go out into the country and we'd

28:57.587 --> 29:12.604
find chickens. or we'd find a rooster and we would 
know when an upperclassman was going home to spend

29:12.837 --> 29:40.347
time with his family on a weekend or go see his 
girlfriend so we'd find a way to get that chicken or

29:12.837 --> 29:40.347
that rooster into that individual's closet and 
we'd lock that chicken or that rooster in the

29:12.837 --> 29:40.347
closet and after three days it was not a pretty 
sight. Uniform-wise or otherwise. Or if anybody

29:43.592 --> 29:46.736
had the unfortunate... I remember one time I ran 
over an armadillo and we put that armadillo in a

29:47.938 --> 29:56.890
paper sack. We brought him back and we found the 
softest pillow we could in an upperclassman's

29:56.930 --> 30:02.959
room. And put that armadillo to bed. In the pillow? 
In the bed, covered up on the pillow. And...

30:12.085 --> 30:17.756
Normally, what was the response of the person who 
had the prank played on them? What did they do?

30:19.138 --> 30:22.585
Well, they obviously would try to find who the... 
you know, who the instigator was, and it was always

30:23.122 --> 30:28.535
me, sir, or I did it, sir. Even though you may not 
have done it, it may have been your freshman

30:29.737 --> 30:41.044
buddies down the hall or upstairs, but we were, you 
know, all one, and we were always guilty. What was

30:41.064 --> 30:42.126
then the punishment? then the most horrible 
punishment was having to go to the

30:42.747 --> 30:59.052
community showers in our rain gear and which was 
heavy heavy rubber and in our heavy boots and

30:59.032 --> 31:15.690
having to do push-ups and sit-ups until you could 
hardly stand it and while while there was steam you

30:59.032 --> 31:15.690
know coming from the showers they put the showers 
on hot and and so the combination of steam
