WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:06.710
tough to really answer which one was the toughest. 
Now, I was wondering about, as director in 56 and

00:07.592 --> 00:26.799
57, were you ever approached by, you must have 
worked, not approached by, but you must have

00:07.592 --> 00:26.799
worked with the builders of the aircraft, didn't 
you? Yeah, they sometimes came by and talked

00:31.199 --> 00:31.840
about. What was your relations with these people? 
More as technical representatives in terms of

00:37.247 --> 00:53.288
what we thought about various aspects of the 
airplane and the simulators, too. Were there

00:53.308 --> 00:55.731
certain simulators, too? Did they build the 
simulators?

01:00.077 --> 01:01.138
I think simulators probably built by different 
people. Were there certain guidelines? You're in

01:06.201 --> 01:17.634
a position where you could make recommendations 
to the Pentagon pro or con a certain airplane

01:06.201 --> 01:17.634
because of the problems with training, I would 
imagine. Is that true? Yes, we made our

01:18.455 --> 01:23.660
recommendations to the training commander, and 
they made them to the Pentagon. So did the Air Force

01:23.700 --> 01:29.927
set up certain guidelines that you'd have to 
follow when you talked to these representatives

01:23.700 --> 01:29.927
from the companies?

01:34.598 --> 01:34.858
No. Usually they were there to tell us about 
something they had done to fix something that had

01:36.821 --> 01:59.372
been a problem, and to

01:36.821 --> 01:59.372
get our opinion on different

01:36.821 --> 01:59.372
things. When did we start When did we start, of 
course this is a time of nuclear deployment too,

02:00.670 --> 02:12.844
and we were having nuclear, our atomic bomb 
testing. When did we start deploying nuclear

02:12.864 --> 02:17.109
weapons on fighters? When did we?

02:26.800 --> 02:28.382
We got them in Europe when I was there. In the 60s. So 
that was 60 to 62. They had them before then, I

02:33.013 --> 02:40.382
imagine.

02:40.442 --> 02:42.464
I don't know what that was like. So we had tactical 
nuclear weapons then. Did you ever have any

02:47.750 --> 02:50.513
training? You had nuclear capabilities on these 
airplanes that you were training your students.

02:54.999 --> 02:58.943
Did you have any training or remember any 
training, special training,

03:02.517 --> 03:06.402
I must have been new. No, we had a school area at 
Randolph that we ran. It had to do with

03:11.168 --> 03:16.614
characteristics. And I had a course at Sandia. I 
had a course at Sandia. People attended. On all

03:24.424 --> 03:28.789
the, I think all of them had to attend. All those who 
were involved with it. They

03:31.694 --> 03:45.636
had to have that orientation course, and they had 
courses of their own in the organization.

03:45.656 --> 03:48.260
So this was set up before you even got on? Well, we 
had a special weapons section in the Crew Training

03:48.280 --> 03:52.768
Air Force. We were responsible for setting up the 
syllabuses and the curriculum for these courses.

04:00.888 --> 04:03.532
That started a long time before I got it. So it 
started a long time before the mid-50s. Probably

04:08.418 --> 04:09.199
started when? Early 30s? Early 50s? At least then. 
Maybe even late 40s. Were there any special

04:16.810 --> 04:26.904
problems because of the nuclear deployment?

04:26.924 --> 04:27.444
Well, yes. You had a high degree of...

04:34.250 --> 04:37.174
You had to have a high degree of training. People 
had to be qualified and then they had to display

04:37.194 --> 04:42.562
that proficiency. Sure.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.777
And safety was prime. It was paramount to 
everybody. And you could certainly flunk an ORI or

04:57.664 --> 05:03.312
something else if you messed up in any way or any 
other special way.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.634
What was it? We had procedures that had to be 
followed in the letter. I would

05:20.906 --> 05:27.896
imagine. And everybody was supposed to know.

05:33.704 --> 05:39.812
What about an attack procedure to use a tactical 
nuclear weapon? on infantry or tanks or something

05:41.260 --> 06:09.360
like that how could an airplane ever move in and 
drop a low level particular weapon and then escape

05:41.260 --> 06:09.360
the blast itself we all we were using him he'd come 
down and pull up toss it over your shoulder you roll

05:41.260 --> 06:09.360
out i see what's known as the shoulder toss i see so 
he'd come down real low you wouldn't We wouldn't

06:09.577 --> 06:14.183
use a tactical weapon on it, just troops. No, 
they'd be on something bigger than that. Did you

06:18.488 --> 06:19.289
practice? Not practice, but I mean, did you train 
against ships, like a squadron of ships or

06:19.629 --> 06:27.138
something like that? No.

06:32.185 --> 06:33.666
We had practiced. We practiced against ships, but 
I mean, you didn't target them. Because

06:38.804 --> 06:52.282
they make an excellent radar. Oh,

06:52.302 --> 07:03.477
yeah. Doing it by radar is an excellent target. 
Most of the work that I was associated with was for

07:04.338 --> 07:05.680
ground targets. Airfields. Plants.

07:08.960 --> 07:15.766
See

07:08.960 --> 07:15.766
these? Particular

07:15.786 --> 07:22.152
parts of the area. Radar. Wow. After you left that 
job, you had a rather unusual job as the Air Force

07:23.173 --> 07:32.302
Senior Advisor for three years, 57 to 60, in 
Indiana. In the Indiana National Guard. That is an

07:36.285 --> 07:38.207
unusual assignment, isn't it? Or an Air Force 
colonel? No. But I mean for somebody with your

07:43.388 --> 07:45.611
background. They have one in every state. And this 
was a fighter wing. And I was there as advisor

07:53.980 --> 08:03.771
to the wing commander and three squadrons.

08:05.893 --> 08:07.435
Advise in what? advising them on the Air Force 
policies and procedures. I had some, I had the Air

08:13.018 --> 08:23.047
Force advisor, officer type pilot with each 
squadron. And I had the airmen, specialists, and

08:24.569 --> 08:34.558
personnel in supply and maintenance. And we 
observed their procedures during their training

08:37.402 --> 08:43.609
and advised them on it. Helped them keep their 
records right and see if they kept their records

08:43.629 --> 08:47.514
right. All on Air Force procedures. What did you 
think was the quality of the National Guard? Did

08:52.921 --> 08:53.962
you form any opinion? Very impressive. Really? 
Very impressive. As a matter of fact, they came to

08:57.486 --> 09:02.372
Europe right after that and they did a hell of a job. 
They came to Europe when

09:07.810 --> 09:35.353
truman

09:07.810 --> 09:35.353
i mean not truman kennedy sent sent all those units 
over there in the 60s they did a real fine job

09:43.113 --> 09:50.424
They really develop a lot of good pilots, 
well-trained pilots. And the core of the whole

09:50.444 --> 10:02.663
thing are the technicians, which are there all the 
time and do all the maintenance on the airplanes.

10:02.683 --> 10:09.373
And the other people come in on the

10:02.683 --> 10:09.373
weekends and go to camp in the summertime. And they 
build up some darn good units. And they've got a lot

10:14.167 --> 10:25.582
of talent, just a lot of

10:14.167 --> 10:25.582
talent in the National Guard. I've often heard 
from some reserve officers that there's some

10:25.602 --> 10:40.002
tension between reserve officers and the Army 
Reserve, National Guard, et cetera, and the

10:25.602 --> 10:40.002
radar. regular officers. Did you find any of them? 
What's your comment on that?

10:48.091 --> 10:53.878
Well, I think the regular officers tend to look 
down on the reserves. It's not being

10:53.898 --> 10:58.284
trained. By and large, the reserves and the 
National Guard are a lot of them. I know the

11:03.830 --> 11:05.572
National Guard isn't a reserve. It's probably not 
as well done as Might as well train. Might as well

11:12.073 --> 11:13.935
train. Really? They don't

11:14.115 --> 11:19.261
have it. The National Guard got double 
motivation. They work for the state, too. Sure.

11:23.786 --> 11:33.396
The state has put up

11:23.786 --> 11:33.396
with it. They won't put up with it. A lot. They won't 
put up with it. Thank you, thank you, or anything

11:37.559 --> 11:42.585
like that. Okay. Depends on the state, would you 
say? Probably

11:44.908 --> 11:51.797
depends on the general state. I'm sure

11:51.817 --> 11:57.785
it's the same. I guess it would be different in 
different states. I've been associated with lots

12:00.789 --> 12:03.653
of National Guard organizations. I've been 
associated with a number of organizations. But

12:04.964 --> 12:08.409
all of them in Indiana and some of them here in Texas 
are aware. Indiana, yes, I investigated an

12:08.430 --> 12:12.376
accident. That's one thing senior advisors does, 
is to send to investigate the accident of the

12:12.396 --> 12:21.470
commander of the 10th Air Force. It was the 10th. I 
don't know where they are now. And they report back

12:24.375 --> 12:27.580
on it. part of it is looking over the squadron to see 
what kind of people we got and how they do it and what

12:29.888 --> 12:37.218
the procedures are. I investigated one

12:37.238 --> 12:45.129
there in the Dallas Naval Air Station. There was a 
National Guard squadron there, a Texas National

12:45.310 --> 12:49.956
Guard squadron there,

12:58.745 --> 13:01.449
I don't know what they were flying. They had an 
accident on the T-33.

13:05.996 --> 13:09.321
And what did you think of the Texas Air National? 
And I also was with them at Ellington

13:10.262 --> 13:28.549
and

13:10.262 --> 13:28.549
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota. 
all those National Guard units on committee. And

13:37.260 --> 13:40.745
they're all good organizations. I've heard from 
some that there's more politics in the National

13:40.765 --> 13:54.264
Guard than in regular service. What's your 
opinion of that? That's probably true.

14:03.072 --> 14:07.277
Is that decreased efficiency, or did you have any 
problems with that? Any problems that you had to

14:07.377 --> 14:10.120
deal with directly in Indiana? No, there were no 
problems there. Politics is an adjunct general,

14:12.483 --> 14:17.429
who the adjunct general is. Sure.

14:29.245 --> 14:42.985
I guess getting to be appointed, you have to know 
the head of the

14:29.245 --> 14:42.985
general. But as far as the officers that you met in 
the Air National Guard, you found them of what type

14:43.005 --> 14:51.437
of quality? High quality. High quality. High 
quality. High caliber people. Let's move on then.

14:59.164 --> 15:02.107
They spent the next four years in Germany. I spent 
two years

15:02.127 --> 15:24.332
with the 86th Air Division, which you grew out of 
the 86th Fighter Interceptor.

15:25.853 --> 15:27.155
It's Swineford. Mm-hmm. Oh, so it was her reunion. 
Well, not really. I was director of operations for

15:33.952 --> 15:55.654
two years, and we

15:33.952 --> 15:55.654
phased out the F-86B and phased in the F-102 for our 
interceptors.

15:55.674 --> 15:56.575
And we also had the radar squadron. We found an 
operations center.

16:03.020 --> 16:07.446
Did you have any dealings during these four years? 
Did you deal with NATO? Well, we had a German

16:10.891 --> 16:23.749
liaison officer on staff.

16:24.590 --> 16:30.158
And so did you go out on maneuvers with other NATO 
air forces? Well, we participated in joint

16:31.522 --> 16:35.747
exercises, NATO exercises, yes. Q And what were 
your feelings about NATO and its ability to defend

16:36.448 --> 16:43.156
Western Europe? A Well, I thought Air Force-wise, 
we had a pretty good organization. I didn't know

16:51.247 --> 16:53.209
about the ground troops.

17:00.850 --> 17:05.595
At that time, we had tactical

17:00.850 --> 17:05.595
nuclear missiles, too. When did we develop those? 
They were there. When did we develop those? When

17:10.179 --> 17:15.204
did we develop

17:10.179 --> 17:15.204
them? In the 40s, late 40s. So these were 
air-to-air? No, they were air-to-ground. Okay,

17:24.213 --> 17:27.076
air-to-ground.

17:27.356 --> 17:28.958
It's a Matador missile, I think. Matador, yeah. We 
hit them. They were under us, too.

17:38.377 --> 17:43.383
And so you were training with those missiles, 
basically? Yes.

17:47.468 --> 17:49.510
Director of Operations, what were your duties 
there?

17:53.475 --> 17:59.983
I had charge of all the flying and training.

18:03.119 --> 18:26.254
Combat

18:03.119 --> 18:26.254
crew evaluation,

18:03.119 --> 18:26.254
tactical evaluation, we had a tactical 
evaluation team. And we were responsible for all

18:26.274 --> 18:28.317
the training programs and all the crew training 
programs and so forth.

18:32.667 --> 18:35.390
and all the operations. You didn't get to fly 
yourself, did you? Oh,

18:37.612 --> 18:40.956
yeah. Oh, you didn't? Sure did. What type of 
flight? 102. Yeah, 102.

18:48.203 --> 18:48.323
Great. I checked out. 102. I flew them. A lot of them

18:50.125 --> 18:55.731
exercised. So I bet you that was kind of nice to get 
back in the driver's seat. It was. Well, I flew with

19:00.123 --> 19:02.406
the National Guard. I flew just like every other 
pilot. Really? I flew their full missions. I flew

19:06.331 --> 19:09.074
with them on every type of mission they had. When 
they went on maneuvers, I went with them and flew

19:09.395 --> 19:15.422
with them.

19:15.442 --> 19:21.109
Qualified combat ready just the same as every 
pilot in there. I qualified combat ready in 102,

19:21.390 --> 19:23.472
too. Okay.

19:28.338 --> 19:28.418
Wow. How about... Do you think that the Air 
National Guard when you were in Indiana, do you

19:29.485 --> 19:35.813
think that they were, I mean, did they qualify 
combat readiness? I'm sure they did. I had to say

19:37.195 --> 19:41.942
that was one of my jobs to see that they did and see 
that they had the program to do it. We had a range of

19:42.282 --> 19:48.330
our own down below Indianapolis. We dropped bombs 
and scraped and did everything that was required

19:48.350 --> 19:57.282
to fill this attorney. And, well, that's quite an 
accomplishment, isn't it, to get National Guard

19:59.607 --> 20:06.334
or Reserve troops combat ready? Sure is. And we 
have tactical evaluation. The team come in and

20:10.999 --> 20:12.621
evaluate it. I mean, fast. So, that is an 
accomplishment. Isn't it true that, I don't know

20:20.669 --> 20:28.517
about most, but large amounts of our Reserve 
troops are not combat ready? for one reason or the

20:30.421 --> 20:31.763
other. Yes, I think that's true. Very stable.

20:37.569 --> 20:41.473
Why'd you become the vice commander? That was a 
promotion, wasn't it? Yes. The commander of the

20:45.838 --> 20:56.310
Air Force, 17th Air Force, just told me he was going 
to send me up there to be the vice commander.

20:59.783 --> 21:00.604
I said, yes, sir. I'll be happy to go. That was the 
F-105. And did you get to fly that, too? Oh, yeah. I

21:08.413 --> 21:10.355
had to. I don't think the boss man would let me stay 
there if I hadn't. But you wanted to do that anyway.

21:18.004 --> 21:20.006
Oh, yeah. What was your job there? Vice Commander. 
Well, I know, but what did you do as a Vice

21:22.108 --> 21:28.035
Commander?

21:29.568 --> 21:54.428
And

21:29.568 --> 21:54.428
how large was the command? Well, it was a wing base. 
I'd say 3,000 people. How many airplanes? We had

21:55.810 --> 21:56.571
75, 75 radios on that category. I

21:57.648 --> 22:22.617
assisted the commander and he started his 
responsibilities. I did whatever he wanted me to

22:22.637 --> 22:23.318
do.

22:27.736 --> 22:49.862
some

22:27.736 --> 22:49.862
of the things he turned over me to do, but to mark a 
training program, to handle a lot of disciplinary

22:27.736 --> 22:49.862
matters, court-martials.

23:04.186 --> 23:24.124
Did

23:04.186 --> 23:24.124
you have any discipline

23:04.186 --> 23:24.124
or

23:04.186 --> 23:24.124
anything like that? No. Did troops get along well 
with

23:24.225 --> 23:29.630
the Germans? Oh, yeah. Yeah, the Germans. We had a 
good relationship with the locals. We had tennis

23:31.111 --> 23:31.751
matches with them. No kidding? Yeah. Soccer 
teams. We invite them to our football games.

24:09.222 --> 24:28.314
He

24:09.222 --> 24:28.314
had me do a lot of letter writing and

24:09.222 --> 24:28.314
things like that. Who was a commander? I had two 
different ones.

24:39.884 --> 24:45.414
He was later a brigadier general. The second one's

24:45.434 --> 24:50.083
name was Blood. Blood?

24:57.336 --> 24:59.800
Was he a cold-blooded guy? No, he was a nice guy. He 
retired down in Austin.

25:05.163 --> 25:11.030
I was wondering about this time that France was en 
route to get out of NATO. Yeah, that was getting

25:11.651 --> 25:13.153
pretty hairy. How so, and how did that affect you 
people? Oh, the NATO language was supposed to be

25:16.918 --> 25:32.638
English, and the French controller started 
talking French, and they made it very difficult to

25:16.918 --> 25:32.638
get a clearance to fly with France, so we more or 
less stayed away from France. Well, we did fly over

25:33.817 --> 25:35.839
there. We did fly over there.

25:40.765 --> 25:45.970
It got pretty sticky. Were there negative 
feelings toward the French? Yes. Do you remember

25:49.194 --> 25:54.059
any incidents or episodes? No, not to bring up any 
incidents or episodes. It just was a general

25:56.462 --> 25:59.605
feeling against them. And did it, now of course 
they were moving things out of France and into

26:00.260 --> 26:04.186
Germany. Did that have any impact on your air base? 
Yeah. How? Well, not on our air base. Some of them

26:10.876 --> 26:12.819
had moved. Ramstein must have had a big increase. 
Yeah. Well, that was at Midburg. Yeah, right. Oh.

26:27.541 --> 26:28.022
We did have some of the guys go back to France and go 
by and see some people that they had known and said

26:29.150 --> 26:47.251
the people told them that this wasn't what the 
French people wanted, it's what they'd all

26:29.150 --> 26:47.251
wanted. And it had nothing to do with their 
feelings against the Americans. And these are

26:51.636 --> 26:57.823
some people that had been stationed in one of the 
bases that had to move. and going back to see their

26:58.462 --> 27:03.751
friends in France. What was the general attitude 
of the Air Force toward the French in this

27:03.771 --> 27:19.136
behavior?

27:19.156 --> 27:23.423
Well, it was a gentle, gentle feeling of disgust 
and awe.

27:27.824 --> 27:35.692
not necessarily the French people themselves.

27:35.712 --> 27:38.995
And we started calling them Air France, Air 
Chance. They couldn't be dependent upon us.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.162
That's right. That's good.

27:49.705 --> 27:50.746
Well, you have to leave Germany. You were there for 
four years. I suppose your wife was with you,

27:51.827 --> 27:53.469
wasn't she? Yeah, my wife and children. And they 
were in American schools. Were you eager to get

27:58.790 --> 28:04.896
back to the United States after four years?

28:09.981 --> 28:15.025
Well, I wasn't particularly eager to come back to 
the job that I was in. Yeah, Commandant of?

28:16.707 --> 28:21.351
Squadron Officer School.

28:21.371 --> 28:21.912
Of the what? Squadron Officer School. Okay, 
Squadron Officer School. at the Air University,

28:25.705 --> 28:28.970
so you're back in education again. Yeah. And this 
is a position of responsibility. How many

28:33.776 --> 28:38.162
students are at that school a year?

28:41.307 --> 28:43.390
Something over 2,000. We have 703 classes

28:43.410 --> 28:47.255
of 750. And how long does the course run?

29:00.856 --> 29:05.160
I didn't think I'd ever get that number. About 12 
weeks. 12 weeks. Now, what was the aim of the

29:10.084 --> 29:14.729
school? Well, the purpose was to qualify the young 
officers to be Spartan-level

29:15.089 --> 29:29.682
staff officers

29:33.391 --> 29:39.739
How did you do

29:33.391 --> 29:39.739
that? Well, we gave them a very thorough academic 
course, and then we put them in practical

29:39.759 --> 29:54.098
problems, and they were all divided into 
seminars, and the seminars worked as a group to

29:39.759 --> 29:54.098
solve the problems. And each seminar, each little 
group, each section had its faculty member in it.

30:05.690 --> 30:16.506
We divided them up based on their backgrounds, so 
we would get a completely heterogeneous

30:05.690 --> 30:16.506
background together. They weren't homogenous. 
Sure. Everybody had their ideas. This guy did the

30:20.913 --> 30:23.677
SAC, and this would be the MAC, and this guy. We 
broke up the section by computer and assigned them

30:23.697 --> 30:29.565
that way. What did you think was the quality of that 
school? I thought it was outstanding. It was

30:34.681 --> 30:36.102
outstanding when I got there.

30:39.145 --> 30:39.966
Did you improve it? I mean, was there anything that 
you could do? The only thing that I could do was try

30:45.232 --> 30:53.640
to preserve the standard that we had and select 
people. We'd select instructors from the people

30:54.561 --> 31:00.667
going through, and we had very high standards. To 
qualify to be an instructor at Squadron Officer

31:00.687 --> 31:03.810
School was a real honor. They were highly 
motivated and really gung-ho. What rank were most

31:11.994 --> 31:14.576
of the instructors? First lieutenants and 
captains. We had students who were second

31:18.340 --> 31:21.743
lieutenants and first lieutenants? First 
lieutenants. They were basically all first

31:23.205 --> 31:27.469
lieutenants? First lieutenants, you might have a 
captain or two.

31:36.055 --> 31:41.381
Kirstie Townsend, less than seven years service. 
Were they all career-oriented officers? Um,

31:45.266 --> 31:54.156
yeah. How did you maintain those high standards 
besides picking top notch instructors when

31:54.176 --> 32:03.987
vacancies occurred?

32:08.945 --> 32:17.273
Well, the organization had a real high esprit de 
corps, and we critiqued everything before we put

32:08.945 --> 32:17.273
it on. We made sure it was what we wanted before we 
put it on.

32:23.960 --> 32:30.566
And even every lecture that I gave was rehearsed 
and critiqued before we put it on. And they don't

32:31.907 --> 32:35.851
mind shooting, punching punches at you. At the 
boss. At the boss, and tell him All

32:38.830 --> 33:01.360
due respect, sir, but... We had one

32:38.830 --> 33:01.360
old retired civilian professor that was real good 
at that, too. Everybody participated in

33:01.380 --> 33:03.884
everything. We even had the athletic board. We had 
a hell of an athletic board. I was assigned to a

33:09.323 --> 33:13.127
section, and I competed in that section and all 
that too. No kidding? All the families there,

33:14.369 --> 33:20.736
after we'd finish our sports, we'd have all the 
families there for kicking.

33:22.618 --> 33:23.720
What type of athletics? Well, we played soccer, 
flicker ball, you know what flicker ball is? It's a

33:31.949 --> 33:34.012
little longer than basketball courts. We played 
with basketball back boys in football. You can't

33:37.910 --> 33:43.419
run with the ball, you have to pass it. Is that the 
one where you run three steps and have to throw it?

33:47.046 --> 33:50.231
Yeah, hit the board, flicker ball.

33:53.056 --> 33:54.519
Soccer, flicker ball. And you participated with 
all of your... Volleyball, volleyball.

34:15.895 --> 34:22.743
But basically, it was your aim then, just to 
maintain those high standards. Well, improve

34:24.065 --> 34:27.629
them if we could, but... Well, was there any way you 
could improve them? No. Then did you improve them?

34:41.085 --> 34:43.067
I don't know whether we did or not, but we tried to. 
What specifically did you try to improve, do you

34:45.123 --> 34:53.094
remember?

34:53.114 --> 35:02.806
Well, we took suggestions from the students and

34:53.114 --> 35:02.806
staffed them, and if they looked good, we 
implemented them. We did make some changes. So

35:04.388 --> 35:07.933
there was a good relationship between 
instructors and students. Oh, yeah.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.379
They're just like... It was a very close 
relationship, and over each there were two

35:13.017 --> 35:34.288
different wings, and then there was

35:13.017 --> 35:34.288
competition between the wings. We started 
several new programs, but I don't remember

35:34.308 --> 35:39.295
specifically what they were right now. Now, at 
this time, at this time, of course, the warrant is

35:39.848 --> 35:54.050
really increasing.

35:54.070 --> 36:01.782
You'll hear 1964, 65, 66, especially 65 and 66, the 
big buildup. And here you are at Maxwell Air Force

36:02.944 --> 36:05.468
Base. I was wondering if you applied for service. 
Did you want to go to Vietnam? Oh, I sure did. Did you

36:13.622 --> 36:14.222
apply? No, I had no way of applying. Well, I mean, 
did you volunteer? Did you write a letter? Did you

36:21.371 --> 36:23.474
have somebody that you could? No, I didn't have 
somebody I could write to. I could have, but I

36:25.576 --> 36:28.420
didn't. I didn't write a letter at that time.

36:39.856 --> 36:46.666
I figured that I had a good chance of going there as 
soon as I finished my tour, but I wasn't. No, so what

36:46.686 --> 36:54.998
happened here in July 1967 to September 1967, here 
you're sent off to the Azores. You're the

36:55.018 --> 37:02.168
commander of the U.S. forces in the Azores, but at 
the same time you get a promotion. Tell me how, what

37:03.751 --> 37:11.661
happened on, how'd you first learn the fact that 
you were going to be promoted to a general officer?

37:11.681 --> 37:14.745
Um, my boss told me. The

37:14.765 --> 37:20.532
commander there in the university. Told me I was 
going to do this. Well, what'd you say? I said,

37:24.016 --> 37:28.001
thank you, sir. Told him that was great. Did you 
think that you were going to make it to generals?

37:33.620 --> 37:35.543
Not at that time. Why not? Well, I just didn't know 
whether I'd had enough experience to warrant

37:39.328 --> 37:50.303
promotion.

37:50.323 --> 37:58.675
The way you get promoted, you've got to get on the 
major commander's list before you even get

37:50.323 --> 37:58.675
submitted. And then after you get there, well, 
that's it. a promotion board and makes a decision.

38:07.490 --> 38:14.760
Probably 6,000 colonels or however many they're 
going to promote.

38:14.780 --> 38:17.803
So your chances are not always good.

38:21.268 --> 38:26.795
I just happened to have my commander on the 
platform. Who was that commander? General

38:29.018 --> 38:29.378
Parkinson. Carpenter at the University of, he was 
the commander of the area.

38:36.189 --> 38:41.234
And you think that's the main reason you received 
that promotion? Because of his influence? Yes.

38:44.137 --> 38:45.338
Was he his research? Yes.

38:50.003 --> 38:57.331
Did they give you a certain, did they tell you about 
how you were supposed to act when you became the

38:50.003 --> 38:57.331
general? No. After I got my assignment, I was made a 
brevet general, a brigadier general, because the

38:59.783 --> 39:21.806
commander of the Portuguese Air Force in the 
Azores was a brigadier general. And my promotion

39:21.826 --> 39:28.153
wasn't due until after I was reported in, so I 
pinned on my stars before I got promoted. I got

39:28.994 --> 39:30.777
promoted, but I didn't get paid. I'll put it that 
way. I got promoted, but I didn't get paid until

39:31.878 --> 39:35.283
later. And so that was when you arrived in the 
Azars, you'd be on the same level as the commander

39:35.304 --> 39:45.499
of the Portuguese

39:35.304 --> 39:45.499
Air Force. Tell me about that job in the Azars. How 
large was our force at that time? Our force was not

39:53.125 --> 39:57.209
particularly dark at that time. It was a command, a 
joint command under St. Glam. And it was a joint

40:02.695 --> 40:20.635
command, Army, Navy, Air Force command, for the 
Azores, which was mainly lodges,

40:02.695 --> 40:20.635
airbases.

40:23.382 --> 40:39.679
The Air Force organization was a wing, was an air 
base wing under Military Airlift Command.

40:39.699 --> 40:47.247
As such, I reported to the commander of the 21st Air 
Force

40:39.699 --> 40:47.247
in New Jersey, which is a subcommand of Military 
Airlift Command. But as a Joint Commander, I

40:50.045 --> 40:56.531
reported to the Joint Chief of Land. And this Air 
Base Wing maintained the

40:56.551 --> 41:08.503
base and serviced all the airplanes, maintained 
the airplanes that came through. We had assigned

41:08.523 --> 41:12.928
to us a C-54. That's the only airplane we had. No 
kidding. This must have been mostly a diplomatic

41:16.672 --> 41:19.174
job. But

41:20.268 --> 41:33.426
the Navy had a squadron there of anti-sub warfare, 
so they didn't fly. And the Army maintained the

41:33.447 --> 41:37.552
rescue boats. What did the Air Force do? The Air 
Force took care of them on the ground. Took care of

41:41.137 --> 41:42.239
their one plane? No, it took care of everybody. Oh, 
it took care of everybody's plane on the ground. We

41:49.208 --> 41:55.914
didn't take care of the Navy's planes that were 
there, because they had their own squadron and

41:49.208 --> 41:55.914
maintenance hangar, and all the transit 
airplanes. See, it's a transit business. The

41:58.236 --> 42:09.887
American Air Lift Command and the Motor Air Lift 
Command came through there daily,

41:58.236 --> 42:09.887
hauling supplies, different people, different 
places. But it was a very unusual command, because

42:09.907 --> 42:18.135
the Army had all the boats, and the Navy had all the 
airplanes, And we took care of everybody on the

42:18.402 --> 42:22.268
ground and protected them. We had the Air Police. 
We had the large... And you were in charge of... You

42:25.453 --> 42:30.981
were the senior officer in charge of all of them, 
right? In charge of all of them. And also the

42:32.263 --> 42:43.000
liaison with the ambassador to Portugal, the 
chief of staff of the Portuguese Air Force. And I

42:43.020 --> 42:46.485
went to Lisbon. About once a month. Really? To see 
the Secretary of the Air Force, to see the

42:49.099 --> 42:55.628
Ambassador. To see our Ambassador? Yeah, our 
Ambassador. Who was he at the time? Ambassador

43:00.976 --> 43:07.625
Bennett. How did you get along with the State 
Department people? Just great. We had a very

43:12.752 --> 43:14.835
pleasant relationship. I got along well with the 
consul to the Azores.

43:21.926 --> 43:23.308
Military governor of the Azores. I had to go over to 
see him. He was on another island and so was I. He was

43:27.315 --> 43:30.720
on the same island as the consul was. We had a very 
close relationship. And it was a real good working

43:32.763 --> 43:38.832
relationship. We had civilian programs that we 
were hanging on to with the local Missouri and, you

43:39.908 --> 43:50.542
know, the island we were on. What type of civilian 
programs? We were getting semen for them. It was a

43:55.828 --> 43:58.612
people-to-people program that Eisenhower set 
up. People-to-people program. Semen for

44:00.514 --> 44:03.578
improving the stock. Sterile med flies to help 
eradicate them. You know, different programs

44:08.410 --> 44:13.475
like that.

44:13.495 --> 44:18.040
And we entertained the Portuguese, all the 
Portuguese hierarchy. They entertained us. It

44:21.143 --> 44:25.347
was more a diplomatic job. You're absolutely 
right. How'd you like that? How'd you like being a

44:26.629 --> 44:29.151
diplomat instead of a... It was pretty 
challenging, I'll tell you. It was a pretty

44:31.794 --> 44:33.996
challenging job.

44:39.157 --> 44:42.381
only had one bad thing happen. Well,

44:42.401 --> 44:56.478
the Portuguese had a club on the beach,

44:42.401 --> 44:56.478
and we had some black people.

45:01.084 --> 45:06.010
And we were allowed to go out there and participate 
in it. And these blacks came in while the... Were

45:09.727 --> 45:10.528
they Americans? Yeah, black Americans, 
servicemen. Came in on this, uh, broke in, uh,

45:14.994 --> 45:26.649
busted in on the end of this club, which had been 
reserved that night for a party by Portuguese

45:14.994 --> 45:26.649
officers. And they were, they had altercations in 
place. That was, that was really bad. Well, what

45:36.667 --> 45:37.608
happened? They started fighting? Well, they had a 
little fight, and they left. And they were under

45:43.257 --> 45:44.519
your command? Yeah, they were under my command. 
The blacks were under your command? Yeah, the

45:47.363 --> 45:48.985
blacks were under my command. I wasn't going to go 
out and attack them. How'd you handle them?

45:58.019 --> 46:04.108
I

45:58.019 --> 46:04.108
consulted my boss. after it happened, and he sent 
me some assistance.

46:13.810 --> 46:33.269
A lawyer who had handled similar cases and was a 
great assistance,

46:13.810 --> 46:33.269
by the way, when he got there.

46:33.289 --> 46:34.450
I restricted the airmen to the base, and then 
discussed

46:36.640 --> 47:03.323
the matter

46:36.640 --> 47:03.323
with the senior Portuguese commander and put my 
head in my hand and went to see the head of the Air

46:36.640 --> 47:03.323
Force, the Portuguese Air Force, and told him that 
We would handle it in a way that is pleasing to him.
