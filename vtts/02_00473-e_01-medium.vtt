WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:05.470
You're heading for the lighthouse and he wanted 
you to hit it right on the button. He didn't want you

00:05.490 --> 00:09.315
to be a mile off this way or that way. And he was just, 
everything was the same way. I mean,

00:13.742 --> 00:31.067
if you had a bomb wing and you're supposed to be able 
to load the bombs and be ready to go in 30 minutes,

00:13.742 --> 00:31.067
why, were you supposed to practice enough that 
you'd make it in 30 minutes? And this was a... A

00:31.688 --> 00:36.575
perfectionist. A perfectionist, right. That's 
the word you think that would... Obviously,

00:38.278 --> 00:40.961
that's right. And still he had the human touch that 
people liked to work for

00:41.783 --> 00:49.374
him.

00:57.686 --> 00:59.188
And... And he drove fast cars. I mean, he... And one 
of his hobbies was his turbocharged automobiles.

01:09.374 --> 01:11.817
And he'd work on them himself. So

01:12.638 --> 01:28.999
when I was down at Homestead, he called me up one day 
and wanted me to go up to some outfit in West Palm

01:12.638 --> 01:28.999
Beach to look at a supercharger that he had. Some 
outfit was working up there, some machine shop.

01:36.244 --> 01:43.312
And it was a machine shop

01:36.244 --> 01:43.312
made up of retired people. They didn't hire 
anything but retired people, machinists from

01:43.412 --> 01:51.080
Detroit and what have you.

01:52.282 --> 01:57.788
They were machinists that just did part time work, 
but they were so good that The guy that worked in the

01:58.358 --> 02:02.682
morning could continue the job of the guy in the 
afternoon. And they made a real good supercharger

02:03.923 --> 02:20.018
so I told him what they cost and what I thought of the 
plant and he took it from there.

02:20.038 --> 02:21.059
Good man to work for. Oh yeah, he's a real good man to 
work for. How's his health right now? Oh I think

02:26.524 --> 02:27.505
he's pretty good. How old is he? He's younger than I 
am. I met him by LeMay. He's older than you are. Is

02:35.002 --> 02:35.482
he? Yeah. He always told you older than everybody 
else. Seventy-four? I think he's seventy. Yeah, I

02:41.931 --> 02:45.615
think he's seventy-four now. That's what I told 
him in February. I think that's how old he is.

02:54.518 --> 02:59.183
It was right after your command with the 379th that 
you were promoted to Brigadier General. Yeah,

02:59.203 --> 03:13.179
well see, as a result of, I mean, actually what we 
did in 379th is why he promoted me to become the Air

02:59.203 --> 03:13.179
Division Commander at Homestead. Then I just took 
over from previous commander who was transferred

03:15.021 --> 03:23.631
out. So, at Homestead, how many wing commanders 
did you have? Well, you had two wing commanders and

03:30.853 --> 03:34.657
an air base group commander. Okay, so you had three 
and then you had a brigadier general in charge of

03:34.677 --> 03:42.244
those three who was in charge of the entire air 
division. Yeah, then you had three colonels

03:42.384 --> 03:51.373
commanding one air base group and two wing 
commanders. 19th Bomb Wing, 379th Bomb Wing, and

03:52.552 --> 03:57.898
the Air Base Group. In other words, so you went from 
leading about 1,800 men to leading 6,500 men.

04:06.487 --> 04:13.115
Yeah, probably 30, probably pretty close, about 
5,000.

04:13.135 --> 04:16.899
Now you remained a colonel from, I think, 1943 to 
1957. Is that right? Were you getting frustrated?

04:22.235 --> 04:27.241
Well, that's the reason I said I was going to go to my 
master's degree. When I commanded the 315, way

04:28.002 --> 04:34.549
back in 48, I was recommended for promotion at that 
time. And I was recommended for promotion when I

04:34.669 --> 04:40.115
commanded the security service. Well, I just 
wasn't selected at the time.

04:48.024 --> 04:49.626
So I figured that If the Air Force didn't want to 
promote me, I just didn't want to be dead wood

04:50.365 --> 04:55.690
around.

05:01.896 --> 05:03.698
How many times can you be passed over? Well, you're 
not passed over. Okay, well, what's the

05:06.860 --> 05:08.322
difference here? I mean, a man who now is staying at 
the same rank for 14 years, I mean, how do they, I

05:18.496 --> 05:22.281
know that sometimes they ease people out of this, 
or they force retirement, don't they? How does

05:22.842 --> 05:23.643
this work? Well, see, if you, see I was promoted to 
permanent colonel, and that automatically

05:24.464 --> 05:36.379
grants you 30 years service. Oh, it does? Oh, I 
didn't know that. Oh, I see. So if you are promoted

05:39.683 --> 05:47.112
to lieutenant colonel, then that automatically 
grants you 28 years service. I see. And then if you

05:48.517 --> 05:56.945
don't make lieutenant colonel, then there's a 
period, I think, 18 years or something of this

05:48.517 --> 05:56.945
sort. And you have to do a lot of string pulling to 
get to stay on active duty for 20 years in order to be

05:57.766 --> 06:07.936
able to retire. And see, when I was selected for 
permanent colonel in whatever it is, 46, 48, Well,

06:17.980 --> 06:23.888
then that automatically guaranteed me until 
1963. But you

06:23.908 --> 06:33.662
could have retired as early as 1953 with no pay. 
Yeah, yeah.

06:38.328 --> 06:43.195
And then if you are selected for a permanent BG, a 
permanent major channel, Why didn't you get to

06:45.638 --> 06:48.501
stay on for 35 years service? And so that's the 
reason that I had to retire in 1963. So I got

06:57.652 --> 07:03.038
promoted to permanent colonel, but not to a 
permanent BG. OK. Now let's go back to Homestead,

07:03.358 --> 07:07.623
Florida. OK. For two years there, you were the 
commander of the Air Division. How did this differ

07:14.950 --> 07:19.834
from your command as a wing commander?

07:22.396 --> 07:26.560
Well, it's more of an administrative job. More 
coordination. A wing commander is more of a flying

07:28.021 --> 07:31.204
job. You're in the day-to-day operations of 
scheduling, watching airplanes,

07:32.325 --> 07:44.535
briefing pilots, and things of this sort. Your Air 
Division is a job of checking on each wing to be sure

07:45.089 --> 08:02.030
that they're doing their job and checking on the 
Air Base Group to be sure that they're supporting

07:45.089 --> 08:02.030
the wings in the areas that they're supposed to. 
And then your Air Division and the Bay Air Base

08:03.212 --> 08:11.923
Group are more into the community functions. Your 
flying wing commanders do very little of making

08:14.515 --> 08:25.284
speeches to the Rotary Club and things of this 
sort. Sure, and so now you got to use some of that

08:25.724 --> 08:35.953
personnel development that you received at the 
Air War College, going out and meeting the Chamber

08:25.724 --> 08:35.953
of Commerce and things like that. Did you give a lot 
of speeches during this time? Oh yeah, well you

08:38.035 --> 08:41.758
made Well, not a lot. A lot of times you just go down 
and have a cup of coffee with the mayor and have him

08:45.925 --> 09:10.412
out or you invite a group of the top civilian 
personnel, people, the president of the bank and

08:45.925 --> 09:10.412
out for lunch and give them a tour of the base.

09:11.472 --> 09:14.976
and tell them how much money we were spending in 
their community. Oh, make them feel good. Tell

09:16.158 --> 09:24.468
them how important the Air Force is to their 
community. And this type of thing. And how did you

09:26.771 --> 09:29.214
get along with the mayors, and how did you get along 
with them? Oh, you get along with them normally

09:29.374 --> 09:32.558
real good. You have no...

09:38.085 --> 09:39.387
I don't know of any...

09:42.623 --> 09:54.405
any problem I had with any mayor, including the 
mayor of Misawa, Japan, and the governor of the

09:42.623 --> 09:54.405
prefecture. It's the same type of community 
relations type of thing.

10:06.822 --> 10:29.758
When I was in, speaking of this community 
relations stuff, I was in the United States Navy,

10:06.822 --> 10:29.758
and I was just an enlisted man, but I often found 
that there was a negative community feeling

10:06.822 --> 10:29.758
toward the Navy men, the sailors in the particular 
towns that I was at. I would imagine that in

10:29.857 --> 10:35.322
Homestead some of your airmen felt the same way. 
How did you cope with a problem like that? Well,

10:38.085 --> 10:56.623
I don't

10:38.085 --> 10:56.623
remember of any instances where you had any

10:38.085 --> 10:56.623
problem. I think the only problem you have is where 
your airmen start picking up VD at a certain

10:57.211 --> 11:16.430
location and you put it off limits and then 
everything gets in an uproar when you put some bar

10:57.211 --> 11:16.430
off limits. And

11:16.691 --> 11:26.020
that's where you run into,

11:16.691 --> 11:26.020
I guess you do your best persuasive act to get the 
mayor to clean up the place.

11:39.048 --> 11:54.572
But I don't think we really had the same problems as 
they had around Fort Benning at one time where we

11:39.048 --> 11:54.572
had almost open warfare between the civilian and 
the military.

11:56.932 --> 12:01.076
I can't remember the town that was in Bob.

12:05.620 --> 12:21.535
But I think if you visit these people or the base 
commander visits these people once a week, once

12:05.620 --> 12:21.535
every two weeks, and you keep everybody informed 
as to what's going on. Normally your problems are

12:24.623 --> 12:45.230
or lack of communications, like where they think 
the military is excluding them and they're not a

12:24.623 --> 12:45.230
part of the, because they're looking for the 
dollars and the number of people that are spending

12:24.623 --> 12:45.230
money downtown and who are renting their houses 
and all this type of thing.

12:52.199 --> 12:53.280
It really didn't

12:56.078 --> 12:56.899
didn't come up. I don't think we had any problem at 
all in Florida. In fact, I didn't ever have too much

13:02.770 --> 13:08.339
of a problem anywhere with the civilian.

13:10.343 --> 13:21.242
But as long as you keep them informed as to what's 
going on and why you have to restrict sometimes all

13:10.343 --> 13:21.242
your airmen and your officers to base and and 
things of this sort except those that are married

13:21.712 --> 13:26.178
or living off base. You normally have to keep them 
informed of what's going on and they accept that

13:27.400 --> 13:38.074
but it's only when you don't keep them informed as 
to what's going on. At this time you must have had

13:40.417 --> 13:46.285
some black airmen under your command and here you 
are in a pretty much of a segregated state. Did you

13:48.978 --> 13:52.463
have any race problems in Homestead, Florida? I 
never had any race problems at any base I had.

13:58.472 --> 13:58.912
That's good. Because I didn't create a problem. I 
just think that the problems that are created by

14:03.058 --> 14:13.133
your black personnel is

14:15.442 --> 14:18.905
is one where you start talking about a problem. And 
the only area that really came to my attention was

14:19.246 --> 14:30.116
when I was stationed in Misawa some time later. But 
there

14:30.216 --> 14:44.689
you had lots of quarters and the,

14:30.216 --> 14:44.689
an airfoil white guy was living there and colored 
moving in next door. Well, if they wanted to move, I

14:47.083 --> 14:49.347
said, well, you can move. You can move wherever you 
want to. I mean, here's the other quarters. You

14:53.794 --> 14:54.696
just select them. And if you want to pay for you and 
you just want to move, well, just move. And I said,

14:59.343 --> 15:01.186
it's all right with me. So I didn't restrict them 
and say, you have to sit there and live right next

15:02.809 --> 15:11.082
door to a colored person if they didn't want to live 
there. as long as it didn't cost me anything, as

15:11.483 --> 15:15.367
long as it didn't cost the government anything. 
And the only other item is the colored airmen in

15:16.368 --> 15:29.042
barracks would always, every time a white guy 
would move out, the colored guy would move in. So

15:29.502 --> 15:33.707
that you get all the colored and one in the 
barracks, and that's a dangerous situation. So it

15:34.528 --> 15:36.630
wasn't ever too much, these guys with all the 
congregations in one barracks, I would just

15:37.083 --> 15:42.550
disperse them. And

15:42.570 --> 15:48.037
I treated all of them just exactly alike. I mean, 
the crew chief, if he had the best flying record of

15:48.137 --> 16:00.512
his airplane, he was the number one crew chief, and 
he got promoted first. I think as long as you treat

16:00.532 --> 16:05.318
them exactly like you treat everybody else, and 
you brag on them like you brag on everybody else, I

16:05.804 --> 16:10.229
don't think you have any problem. When I was 
stationed up in Missoula, I had a colored pilot who

16:11.050 --> 16:17.058
was my personal pilot. He was your personal pilot? 
Yeah, I mean, who flew me back and forth to wherever

16:18.359 --> 16:23.345
I had to go to a meeting. And he was good, so as far as I 
was concerned, it didn't make any difference what

16:24.367 --> 16:32.757
color he was, as long as he was good and I felt safe by 
him. And when our daughters came back from Stevens

16:33.192 --> 16:40.000
and they would land on top of Chicago, he'd go down 
and pick them up. And they knew who he was and so we

16:41.081 --> 16:48.309
had no problem. So he was top dog as far as everyone. 
So as far as you, if you treat everybody the same,

16:52.594 --> 16:57.320
you have no problem. It's where you start

17:01.424 --> 17:10.674
not treating them different, not promoting them 
the same, if they were just as good, why you have no

17:01.424 --> 17:10.674
problem.

17:18.363 --> 17:29.035
Did you have any, while you were the commander at 
Homestead, did you, what kind of relations did you

17:18.363 --> 17:29.035
have with other commands in the south? Did you try 
to cooperate with other commanders and did you fly

17:30.922 --> 17:40.191
missions with them or did you have any large scale 
missions that you went out on? Well, the only

17:40.211 --> 17:48.259
missions that you had were psych missions. As a 
wing commander you were just as competitive with

17:48.480 --> 18:00.912
the other wings as you are in a football game.

18:01.955 --> 18:07.683
You have a, he had a, General May had an annual 
bombing competition. Oh really? Your wing was,

18:09.165 --> 18:19.820
you prepped that just like you did to peak your 
football team. He had annual bombing from base,

18:19.980 --> 18:27.070
from one SAC base against another SAC base or one 
wing? One wing against another wing. Within your

18:28.592 --> 18:29.533
base? No, no. No, it was SAC-wide. Oh, SAC-wide. 
Yeah, so you sent, each wing was permitted to send

18:35.970 --> 18:41.618
two crews. And you had a bombing competition, 
navigation and bombing competition. And then you

18:49.569 --> 18:55.417
just got eliminated on what your bombing score 
was. At this time, late 1950s, 1957, 1958, How many

19:00.562 --> 19:02.244
wings were there in SAC? Do you remember? Do you 
have any idea? I have no idea. But you're... No, he

19:05.927 --> 19:28.628
would have a commanders conference and he'd have 
all his wing commanders and his division

19:05.927 --> 19:28.628
commanders in and they'd meet at one of the bases 
such as Plattsburgh up in New England and And you'd

19:29.063 --> 19:39.113
play golf, get to know the,

19:29.063 --> 19:39.113
play golf and have briefings as to what was going 
on. And

19:39.153 --> 19:50.444
get all those bank commanders together and get 
them fighting each other about who was best. And I

19:51.485 --> 19:58.092
mean, that's the way to get things going, you know, 
is competition. They loved to put people in

19:58.747 --> 20:01.791
situations where they were competing. Oh, yeah. 
Competing, oh yeah. Who's the best?

20:09.441 --> 20:20.396
But... No, in fact, you had very good relations 
with the other wing commanders, mostly, and

20:09.441 --> 20:20.396
division commanders. Most of it was a competitive 
situation.

20:26.204 --> 20:27.606
And who was best and... He

20:28.278 --> 20:38.974
kept me pretty well informed as to what the

20:28.278 --> 20:38.974
score was. Why did he get rid of you? Why did Curtis 
LeMay send you to Japan? Well, some stupid guy,

20:44.502 --> 20:55.939
some stupid brigadier general over in Japan had a 
heart attack.

20:57.472 --> 21:03.797
And I was picked up and moved to Japan overnight 
just about. Really? Yeah. Well he was the chief of

21:07.040 --> 21:21.712
the Air Force section, MAG, who was really an aide 
to the chief of staff of the Air Defense Force of

21:07.040 --> 21:21.712
Japan, Japan Air Force. And he had a heart attack 
and they had to pick a general officer right quick

21:21.733 --> 21:27.057
and and said, went over, and I got the job.

21:37.398 --> 21:38.159
I don't know why. You just get a telegram saying, 
get prepared. So basically then, you were a senior

21:44.669 --> 21:53.903
advisor to the chief of staff, the Air Force chief 
of staff in Japan. You were basically his deputy

21:53.963 --> 21:56.487
then? Or exactly what were your functions? What 
does it mean to be an advisor? You were second in

22:06.538 --> 22:08.200
command then? No, what you were doing, you were, 
see we provided the Japanese with the air defense

22:08.641 --> 22:23.841
command equipment and we provided them with the 
aircraft that they were flying. Of course by this

22:24.428 --> 22:28.332
time Japan had military again. They were an 
independent nation again, right. And they also

22:30.735 --> 22:35.560
had the F-86s. And your military assistance group

22:36.441 --> 22:48.454
followed them almost just like if you were a 
commander. How many airplanes were out of

22:48.474 --> 22:52.579
commission because of parts and And see, we were 
providing them with parts to maintain their

22:53.403 --> 22:59.892
aircraft. And

23:00.353 --> 23:17.836
all their bases, you watched their operational 
status just like you would if you were commanding

23:00.353 --> 23:17.836
them, except you had no authority to tell them what 
to do. And you played golf with them. And you got to

23:22.732 --> 23:34.029
know General Ginder, who was on the raid on Pearl 
Harbor. Oh really? No kidding? Oh yeah. How was he?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.442
Well, he and I never did get along very good. I was 
from SAC.

23:50.272 --> 23:53.075
Well, it was really a fairly interesting job. It's 
more of an attache type of job. That's what it

23:58.700 --> 24:00.381
sounds like, personal relations. Personal 
relations. And of course, I was from SAC, so the

24:03.364 --> 24:16.676
Japanese always thought that I must be a ball of 
fire to be selected from SAC to come over and direct

24:03.364 --> 24:16.676
them and chief them. So I got along with them real 
good. They

24:21.625 --> 24:33.438
were doing a number of things that

24:21.625 --> 24:33.438
I changed when I went over there. Well, of course, 
the way the Air Force runs it, a generator is not

24:33.518 --> 24:43.910
economically repaired because of our labor 
costs. I mean, we're paying somebody $8 an hour to

24:43.930 --> 24:49.776
repair an electrical generator. we don't repair 
it, it's cheaper to buy a new one. Well, we treated

24:54.114 --> 25:02.842
the Japanese exactly the same way, except the 
Japanese labor was dollar an hour. So I said, look,

25:03.723 --> 25:18.497
I said, General Sanagi, I said, it looks like to me, 
I'd gone around their bases and located about a

25:03.723 --> 25:18.497
million dollars worth of electrical 
instruments, airplane instruments,

25:19.051 --> 25:22.855
generators, starters. And I said, look, why don't 
we just provide you with bits and pieces and you

25:24.698 --> 25:33.728
repair them? Oh, he didn't want to do that because 
he was getting them for free. But anyway, I

25:38.614 --> 25:41.677
insisted on this. And I sent it back to Washington 
as a recommendation. And we set up an overhaul

25:46.574 --> 25:57.785
depot over in Japan to overhaul all these airplane 
instruments and things of this sort. And we just

25:58.906 --> 26:01.428
found some bits and pieces. So we saved ourselves a 
lot of money, but the Japanese didn't like it

26:01.448 --> 26:10.197
because it's costing them money to set it up. But 
the only way they can become self-sufficient is to

26:14.080 --> 26:19.525
is to do it themselves and also within their labor 
tolerances. I mean, they could very easily

26:19.545 --> 26:23.028
economically repair these. But this job is mostly 
a type of job of helping them get airplanes from off

26:24.149 --> 26:43.665
of, get the spare parts from the United States so 
that we can get the airplanes flying. And of course

26:43.848 --> 26:48.192
I worked on that pretty hard.

26:51.876 --> 26:57.541
And then, well I didn't particularly like that 
type of game, you had no authority. I wasn't about a

26:57.561 --> 27:08.832
cup of tea, so I worked on a General Burns, who at the 
time was 5th Air Force Commander, to move out of

26:57.561 --> 27:08.832
there. And there was a schedule to The Navy 
commanded the MAG over there, Navy Rear

27:14.138 --> 27:40.045
Admiral, and the Air Force had selected a major 
general to come over to command it, to take his

27:14.138 --> 27:40.045
place, so that put two generals in the MAG, so I got 
out, and I got back to Misawa.

27:41.206 --> 27:57.306
Is it, is this a generalization that has some truth 
that it was considered back in the 1950s that SAC

27:41.206 --> 27:57.306
officers, officers in the Air Force who were in SAC 
were sort of the cream of the crop? Oh I don't know.

27:59.830 --> 28:09.542
Well I would say SAC certainly got almost anything 
they asked for.

28:11.851 --> 28:23.227
I don't know that, I can't say that they got the 
cream of the crop, but LeMay carried a lot of weight

28:11.851 --> 28:23.227
and he had a big mission. I mean he really had a big 
mission of keeping the peace and I think that he did

28:23.327 --> 28:29.536
a good job. I thought everybody was scared of him. 
Including the Russians. Yeah, including the

28:34.403 --> 28:39.630
Russians.

28:41.028 --> 29:02.972
And I think since then, I think since he left 
command there, I think SAC has really gone down in

28:41.028 --> 29:02.972
its capability of keeping the peace, you might 
say.

29:02.992 --> 29:03.993
Let's quit for today. Okay. We've got 15 minutes 
before.
