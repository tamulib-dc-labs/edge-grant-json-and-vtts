00:02.478 --> 00:05.662
We're in the HEAP building, hoping... Heap Center.

00:05.902 --> 00:06.943
Heap Center, I'm sorry.

00:07.464 --> 00:12.409
Heap Center, that's H-E-E-P, hoping that it's going to rain later this afternoon.

00:12.509 --> 00:13.511
Murray, test yours.

00:15.172 --> 00:15.873
One, two, three.

00:20.078 --> 00:24.503
As we begin, Murray, for the sake of a stranger who might not know you and your background,

00:25.073 --> 00:33.130
Would you begin this reminiscence by describing your background before you came here as a student?

00:33.150 --> 00:33.912
Where was home?

00:33.992 --> 00:35.355
Where'd you grow up?

00:36.037 --> 00:38.321
What did mom and dad do for a living and so forth?

00:39.765 --> 00:45.597
Well, Heskel, I grew up on a family farm in northeast Texas in the southwest corner of Lamar County.

00:46.302 --> 00:46.843
Texas.

00:48.666 --> 00:57.180
Our main cash crop was cotton, but we grew corn and alfalfa and had a few cattle and raised a few hogs and raised a few chickens.

00:57.661 --> 01:11.044
It would have been hard to starve us off of that place and went to, started school at a small country, one-room country school called Milford, named after a great-grandfather.

01:11.767 --> 01:16.651
Proceeded from there at the same year Texas went from 11 to 12 year system.

01:17.072 --> 01:25.680
We closed the one room school and moved to town and well they didn't move to town, but the students transferred to town and we went to school in Honey Grove.

01:26.480 --> 01:33.927
I was actually in the Roxton district, but we transferred to Honey Grove and they had permitted us to do that.

01:34.107 --> 01:38.251
That was our place of business where everybody went, where we knew people.

01:38.271 --> 01:40.153
So I began the fifth grade and

01:40.505 --> 01:42.608
Honey Grove and went through high school there.

01:44.512 --> 01:48.458
You were in high school and you moved to Honey Grove when?

01:49.079 --> 01:50.061
Well, I went to Honey Grove.

01:50.081 --> 01:51.082
We stayed on the farm.

01:51.343 --> 01:55.690
I was all the way through high school in the same home.

01:55.710 --> 02:01.239
Actually, my mother lived in this home 73 of her 77 years.

02:02.340 --> 02:05.185
So the farm was passed down on my mother's side.

02:05.205 --> 02:06.227
How many acres?

02:07.389 --> 02:08.250
It was, well...

02:09.327 --> 02:23.485
When my mother and dad married and he purchased the, quote, her Hudson home place from her brothers and sisters, I think there were about something near 100 acres, I'm not sure.

02:24.326 --> 02:33.337
But by the time my dad died, he had made it to 274 acres, something of that sort.

02:33.397 --> 02:37.022
So he had bought a couple of other farms in the process.

02:37.762 --> 02:40.725
Why did you decide to come to Texas A&M?

02:42.447 --> 02:44.209
Never thought of doing anything else.

02:45.670 --> 02:53.839
My dad had a brother who was in the class of 26 here, who was six years younger than my dad.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.661
He was a civil engineer.

02:56.942 --> 02:59.145
And my dad never attended college at all.

02:59.245 --> 03:05.912
My mother went three years to Texas A&M Commerce, what was then East Texas State Teachers College,

03:06.500 --> 03:08.723
and to get a teacher's certificate.

03:08.783 --> 03:12.769
So she didn't get a degree, but she went long enough to get a teacher's certificate.

03:12.789 --> 03:16.034
And that was only 24 miles from our home.

03:17.095 --> 03:32.558
My dad had gone into World War I, dropped out of high school as a junior in high school, right at the end of World War I, served two years, and went back after his return from the service and finished high school, senior year.

03:33.044 --> 03:42.781
But both mother and dad emphasized education, and they both came from families where teaching was an honorable profession.

03:44.023 --> 03:52.038
So I think neither my brother or I never considered anything but that we'd go to college and that we'd go to Texas A&M.

03:53.039 --> 03:54.201
My dad was such a fan.

03:54.682 --> 03:57.347
Did you come to visit before you came to enroll?

03:57.952 --> 04:00.716
Yes, I was here a number of times.

04:01.698 --> 04:04.862
I came down as a freshman on a poultry judging team.

04:06.245 --> 04:10.411
I came down as a junior or senior on a livestock judging team.

04:12.174 --> 04:23.511
And I guess in those years, certainly in the years before I came down, my mother's sister and husband lived in Brine.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.355
He was a manager of Woodson Lumber Company.

04:27.162 --> 04:35.495
which is located at that time at the intersection of College and Texas Avenue, where they come together there right near the south end of downtown Bryan.

04:36.416 --> 04:38.259
So they were here for a number of years.

04:38.319 --> 04:45.490
So I'd been down, I don't know, probably three, four, five times anyway before I came down to school.

04:46.211 --> 04:53.963
When you came to enroll, describe how you got here, who brought you, and what did you bring along?

04:54.567 --> 04:56.369
Of course, I was going to be in the Corps.

04:57.210 --> 05:00.374
And we'd been told ahead of time that we didn't need much stuff.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.696
And I had a trunk.

05:03.577 --> 05:09.544
And I don't remember exactly, but I think we must have sent the trunk down on a bus.

05:10.465 --> 05:18.634
Because when I came to enroll the first time, four students, we came down with a fellow from Honeygrove who was a sophomore.

05:19.711 --> 05:32.050
And three freshmen came down with him, one of them, one of whom decided to enroll at Texas A&M in the local cafe on the weekend before we came down.

05:32.290 --> 05:36.977
I don't think he'd given a thought about school or what he would do, but he came down with us.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.382
And so there were four of us in the car.

05:39.723 --> 05:45.129
We brought everything other than presumably those trunks that maybe some of us shipped.

05:45.149 --> 05:47.372
I don't remember us being real crowded in the car.

05:47.452 --> 05:51.036
We didn't have anything on top of it or pulling anything behind it.

05:51.097 --> 05:54.060
We just, four of us came down in an old Chevy sedan.

05:55.562 --> 06:01.489
The one kid who decided to come didn't have any money to pay his tuition fees.

06:03.091 --> 06:07.116
I had, I'd been valedictorian of this little high school

06:07.417 --> 06:09.100
So I got a tuition waiver.

06:09.801 --> 06:12.345
It was worth $25 a semester.

06:12.826 --> 06:20.738
Got the tuition waiver, and my dad had given me enough money that he presumed it was going to take me through the semester.

06:21.500 --> 06:26.067
And as I recall, it was probably in the $300 to $400 range.

06:27.346 --> 06:33.695
The other boy didn't have any money to pay, so I loaned him with tuition fees and his room boards.

06:34.316 --> 06:40.345
It seems to me the payment was something like $100, $125, and I loaned him that money.

06:40.445 --> 06:42.408
Just word of mouth, I loaned him the money.

06:44.491 --> 06:48.998
When I went back home, my dad chastised me for doing that.

06:49.318 --> 06:57.150
He said, son, that's money, and any time you deal with money, even if it's a good friend, you need to have something on paper.

06:57.890 --> 06:58.334
Well,

06:58.885 --> 07:01.528
The boy's uncles were in the grocery business in Honeygrove.

07:01.548 --> 07:05.011
In fact, they had the grocery store in Honeygrove.

07:05.992 --> 07:20.366
And they, of course, made his debt good, and I was something extra special in the eyes of those, his mother's brothers who ran that grocery store from there on that I'd done it.

07:21.006 --> 07:27.913
Incidentally, he didn't, that fellow didn't graduate from A&M, but he did make it into the sophomore year.

07:28.636 --> 07:32.922
And one of the other boys that came down with us was killed in a car wreck in the sophomore year.

07:34.204 --> 07:41.876
So I was the only one, I guess, you'd say, out of those three freshmen who came down from Honeygrove, I was the only one to graduate.

07:43.238 --> 07:51.370
Describe getting onto the campus and getting to the right place and the right dormitory and all that.

07:52.025 --> 07:55.833
Oh, Haskell, I don't remember those details at all.

07:55.933 --> 08:03.468
We came down with a fellow who was a sophomore, so undoubtedly he knew how to tell us how to find things.

08:03.508 --> 08:04.570
And this is the fall of?

08:04.610 --> 08:06.574
Fall of 1951.

08:07.212 --> 08:13.647
And if I'm not mistaken, that was the first year that freshmen were back on campus proper.

08:13.687 --> 08:19.260
They had been out at the Annex through, I believe, 48, 49, 50, something like that.

08:19.541 --> 08:23.149
And the freshmen were all housed in the fall of 51.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.795
We were housed on the north side of the campus.

08:26.416 --> 08:29.360
So we occupied Milner and Leggett.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.185
I was in Milner Hall as a freshman, now the math department.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.630
What outfit were you assigned to?

08:37.031 --> 08:43.139
Oh, it was, we just had several Air Force outfits and several companies, they called them.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.424
And I think I was in Company 11, as I recall.

08:47.265 --> 08:54.034
It was oriented to quartermaster, but the quartermaster units were over in the upper class area.

08:54.695 --> 08:56.237
We only had a cadre of,

08:57.517 --> 09:00.281
of upperclassmen that lived with us, no sophomores.

09:01.642 --> 09:14.018
In that fall, and actually for two years thereafter, you really, in a way, you had two freshman years here because as a freshman, you lived separately on the North Campus.

09:14.078 --> 09:15.460
We occupied dorms.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.525
We occupied Walton, Leggett,

09:19.994 --> 09:28.709
Miller, Mitchell, which is no longer there, and 14, 15, 16, and 17, we knew all those dorms by numbers rather than name.

09:29.430 --> 09:31.754
But we, all those dorms were full of freshmen.

09:32.455 --> 09:43.774
And we had a few juniors and a few seniors that lived with us as you say company, NCOs or sergeant level and seniors.

09:44.328 --> 09:50.196
And occasionally, they would let sophomores from the other area come over and eat with us in the dining hall or something of that sort.

09:50.256 --> 09:59.770
But basically, in the area around Duncan Hall, the sophomores were the lowest thing on the totem pole because there were no freshmen in that area.

09:59.790 --> 10:03.055
And that didn't happen until the fall, I think, my senior year.

10:03.175 --> 10:06.580
I know that my senior year, we had freshmen living with us.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.783
And that would have been the fall of 54.

10:09.252 --> 10:17.748
or describe the routine for these freshmen then living over on the north side of the campus, and I presume eating at Sebesa.

10:17.969 --> 10:19.031
At Sebesa Hall.

10:19.371 --> 10:23.800
Describe the routine in the dormitory and the dining hall and so forth.

10:26.224 --> 10:31.935
Well, of course, you had a lot of freshmen relative to upperclassmen, so, but you had,

10:32.658 --> 10:39.424
I think they must have done, at least as I observed it, a fairly careful job in selecting the upperclassmen that lived with us.

10:39.464 --> 10:43.208
So they were, on the whole, they were reasonable sorts.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.111
But there was a lot of tomfoolery that went on.

10:46.351 --> 10:49.734
And I can remember, I don't remember much about the early weeks.

10:49.854 --> 10:56.340
I remember they'd get us in the hall in the evening and have company meetings.

10:56.380 --> 11:02.226
And I remember on one occasion being asked to look at the person on your left and one on your right and at yourself.

11:02.830 --> 11:07.395
realized that only one of you were gonna be left when this thing was all said and done.

11:08.236 --> 11:15.524
I also remember a fella from, I can't remember his name, but a fella that came in from Colorado.

11:15.564 --> 11:28.138
His dad pulled up in a Cadillac and they parked on the north side of Milner Hall and he just had a car full of clothes, absolutely full of clothes he brought down with no use.

11:28.238 --> 11:29.659
I mean, we were gonna have a uniform.

11:29.679 --> 11:32.162
Most of us didn't have three changes of clothes,

11:32.615 --> 11:57.508
He had a car full and he spread all of these shirts and things he had out on the bed and somebody found or had what looked like a pile of dog dung or something in an old molded fiber kind of shape and put that right in the middle of one of those white shirts on the bed and it was quite a sight to see this old boy pick up a sheet of paper and try to scoop that

11:57.995 --> 12:00.859
pile of crap off of his shirts.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.721
He didn't last a week.

12:03.021 --> 12:04.784
He was gone before the week was out.

12:05.965 --> 12:22.046
We suffered quite attrition in those days, but another fellow and I, it just hasn't been terribly long ago, pulled out our picture, and I think the picture for the outfit was taken in the spring, so we'd already lost quite a few at that time.

12:22.146 --> 12:25.250
I think we started with about 125 freshmen in that outfit.

12:25.390 --> 12:26.532
It was a large number.

12:26.572 --> 12:27.613
We occupied

12:28.218 --> 12:31.746
the first two floors and part of the third floor of Milner Hall.

12:32.828 --> 12:45.096
Anyway, we counted in this picture, and I think roughly half, we knew that roughly half of the students that were taken in that spring picture got degrees from A&M.

12:45.447 --> 12:48.712
Not all of them in four years, but they'd gotten degrees.

12:48.732 --> 12:52.938
So I don't think the shrink was quite as great as they might have suggested.

12:53.239 --> 12:56.724
Did you all have the same routine of getting up before Reveille?

12:56.824 --> 12:57.245
Oh, yeah.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.929
Did you have to go clean up somebody else's room?

13:00.250 --> 13:01.972
No, I never did.

13:01.992 --> 13:10.385
I suppose different people may have done different things, but I never remember cleaning up an upperclassmen's room.

13:11.226 --> 13:12.248
This was...

13:12.869 --> 13:27.888
Of course, you have to remember, not too long after World War II, the reason, as I understand it, the freshmen were sent out to the annex, O'Brien Air Force Base, was because there was so much resentment about the hazing.

13:27.928 --> 13:41.745
You have kids coming back from World War II and maybe 20, 21, 22 years old and have some 17, 18-year-old sophomore try to tell somebody what to do that had been through the gore of the war.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.502
That didn't go over very well.

13:43.942 --> 13:46.846
So they were totally separated.

13:47.166 --> 13:53.754
So when we came back on campus, I think there was a real strong intent to try to eliminate the hazing as much as possible.

13:54.074 --> 14:04.527
For example, they used to fall us out in the hall maybe 4, 30, 5 o'clock in the morning and have to drop your pants and show your backside to keep

14:04.928 --> 14:06.871
I mean to cut down on any paddling.

14:07.351 --> 14:12.338
And I wasn't aware really of any paddling in our outfit on except one occasion.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.222
Had a beer bust frequently.

14:15.923 --> 14:19.388
And I think this particular one was at Hensel Park.

14:19.488 --> 14:20.690
I don't remember for sure.

14:20.730 --> 14:26.098
But I had two roommates in my first semester of freshman year.

14:26.698 --> 14:29.282
We had our bunks three deep.

14:29.836 --> 14:37.046
And my two roommates were Gene Faltine, was a kid, big German kid from Comfort, Texas.

14:38.548 --> 14:42.694
Been a big high school baseball player, football too.

14:43.896 --> 14:48.302
The other fellow was Tommy Bingham, who was from Lovington, New Mexico.

14:49.984 --> 14:53.329
And Tommy had, let's say, just lived

14:53.849 --> 15:02.702
a life that would have had, he had a lot more experience in a lot of areas for young men than either Gene or I apparently did.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.205
But Tommy liked to drink quite a bit.

15:05.446 --> 15:09.131
And on this particular beer bust, he got loaded.

15:09.191 --> 15:11.374
I expect some of the upper craftsmen got loaded.

15:11.715 --> 15:15.280
A lot of us had come back to the dorms sooner.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.663
Anyway, Tommy came back in

15:18.031 --> 15:24.520
drunk and they had obviously done some beating out in the woods and they didn't have paddles.

15:25.422 --> 15:33.954
They'd obviously used sticks that they'd picked up someplace and maybe even exchanged some licks between freshman and upper-classmen.

15:34.014 --> 15:34.495
I don't know.

15:35.316 --> 15:39.181
But Tommy's rear end looked like a piece of corrugated metal roofing.

15:39.201 --> 15:41.705
I mean, it was just, oh, it looked horrible.

15:42.446 --> 15:44.629
Within just a few days of

15:44.997 --> 16:09.508
of that incident, we had one of these inspections out in the hall, and there was some mad powdering of his backside to conceal the damage that had been done to it, and apparently it worked, because either people chose not to see it or didn't see it, but in any event, there was never any consequence of that.

16:10.249 --> 16:12.692
Describe, as well as you can recall,

16:13.263 --> 16:19.008
that first fall, a typical class day, that is a Monday through Friday day.

16:19.969 --> 16:22.652
When did it start and what happened when and so forth?

16:23.733 --> 16:24.173
Oh, golly.

16:24.814 --> 16:27.276
We didn't have any classes during lunch hour.

16:27.536 --> 16:29.578
But you had, well, wait, start with Reveille.

16:29.658 --> 16:30.299
Oh, Reveille.

16:30.359 --> 16:34.162
Well, everybody had to get up and everybody went to breakfast at the same time.

16:34.202 --> 16:34.763
Six o'clock?

16:37.966 --> 16:42.510
Sometimes we had to march a little before breakfast, but our outfit didn't do a lot of that.

16:42.828 --> 16:43.929
I don't remember.

16:44.530 --> 16:45.191
I don't remember.

16:45.271 --> 16:59.530
I know classes started at eight and so we'd been up and faced inspection and made our beds and room, cleaned our rooms up and had breakfast and so I, my best memory is breakfast was probably about 6.30.

17:00.110 --> 17:00.951
Maybe it was seven.

17:01.612 --> 17:06.058
But we probably had to fall out sometime shortly after six o'clock.

17:06.378 --> 17:07.900
I don't remember the exact time.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.485
Most of us were lock stepped in classes.

17:11.903 --> 17:22.099
you came in and you were assigned a section, and you went to practically all of your classes with the same group of students.

17:22.200 --> 17:34.780
Now, like in a chemistry lecture, there might be several sections put together for the lecture, but when it came to lab, the labs, you were all in exactly the same section.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.945
Paige Morgan and I, who's also in our,

17:38.498 --> 17:41.081
The department, as you know, lives here locally now.

17:41.161 --> 17:44.204
We were in the same, quote, in the same section through that.

17:44.885 --> 17:47.888
So we had all of our first semester classes together.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.372
And it was in agriculture.

17:52.412 --> 17:53.494
Of course, we had labs.

17:53.574 --> 17:54.735
Most of us had labs.

17:54.795 --> 18:00.441
Most of us took, I think, probably that first semester freshman year, about 18 hours.

18:01.242 --> 18:05.506
So we were in class, actually in class, counting our labs and things.

18:05.526 --> 18:08.269
We were in class 27 to 30 hours a week.

18:09.127 --> 18:13.719
Probably didn't, it had CQ as we have now.

18:14.181 --> 18:17.389
We had to be in our rooms from 7.30 to 10.30 at night.

18:19.034 --> 18:19.896
It lights out.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.989
I don't remember, but probably 11 o'clock or so.

18:24.972 --> 18:33.105
Typically during the week, Monday through Friday, were you and your buddies out at Northgate or anywhere else?

18:33.466 --> 18:34.147
Heavens no.

18:36.651 --> 18:37.893
Not in that freshman year.

18:38.354 --> 18:42.340
The only, the only time there was any freedom at all was Friday night.

18:43.366 --> 18:46.191
And during football season, of course, you had to yell practice.

18:46.251 --> 18:51.761
If we were having it locally here, you had to go to the midnight yell practice on Friday night, which incidentally was held at the Grove.

18:53.965 --> 19:00.497
And this third roommate I'm telling you about, more than one Friday night, he'd come in before midnight yell practice drunk.

19:00.916 --> 19:03.739
this big old German kid and I'd prop him up between us.

19:03.799 --> 19:16.091
Must have been a terrible odd looking sight to get him there because I was about five foot six and this German kid is six foot two and we'd prop this 5'11 guy between us and make sure he got to Yale practice back.

19:17.673 --> 19:22.738
In that era, would a freshman have dared not go to Yale practice?

19:25.360 --> 19:26.181
Well,

19:28.169 --> 19:33.697
They, they, I mean, it would have been a terrible risk to take, but I know probably freshmen did.

19:33.757 --> 19:37.242
It was, freshmen tried almost everything.

19:38.183 --> 19:51.042
We had, in our unit, we had four freshmen from Wellington, Texas, and they became the, the ground out, ground out experts in the, in the dorm.

19:51.062 --> 19:52.323
They, they practiced.

19:53.044 --> 19:56.269
They, they, with each, using each other, you know, one in bed,

19:57.025 --> 20:10.063
The one handling the stick, they cut the ends out of these old wooden coat cases and cut a notch right where the handle grip was, in the center of that, so that it just slipped down over a door.

20:10.583 --> 20:23.901
Most of the doors opened to the inside, so you could slip that stick down over the doorknob on the frame of the door and against the door, and the only way anybody could get out of the room was break the stick.

20:23.941 --> 20:26.745
And some guys could do it.

20:27.046 --> 20:28.688
But so they practiced.

20:28.708 --> 20:43.390
They would go down and see from the time they opened somebody's door until they got in there and they dumped the water on somebody and that person immediately jumped from the bed to try to get to the door.

20:43.450 --> 20:48.898
Could they get out, get the door shut, get the stick down on it before people got out?

20:48.918 --> 20:49.679
They were experts.

20:49.719 --> 20:56.749
We had an upperclassman, not in our outfit, but in another outfit on the fourth floor who was really, really obnoxious.

20:58.096 --> 21:05.153
They saved all kinds, I say they because I really don't remember contributing into this at all, but they put

21:05.690 --> 21:10.876
ink and urine and everything you could think of in a wastebasket.

21:10.896 --> 21:15.001
And they drowned this guy out in the middle of the night.

21:15.822 --> 21:21.048
And, of course, they kind of, they splashed and they got it on their feet and stuff.

21:21.068 --> 21:28.137
Well, you could track ink all the way down from the fourth floor down the stairs from the third.

21:28.217 --> 21:35.005
Well, by that time, of course, the foot had lost most of the material they'd collected.

21:35.423 --> 21:38.727
The guy upstairs pretty well knew it wasn't somebody in his outfit.

21:38.787 --> 21:42.912
He pretty well knew it was somebody out of our outfit that drowned him out.

21:43.233 --> 21:49.341
I don't remember what consequences, but we celebrated that he'd gotten his just rewards.

21:52.685 --> 21:59.153
As that year is getting started, what did you think your major was going to be?

22:00.027 --> 22:01.469
Well, I pretty much knew.

22:01.509 --> 22:02.731
I never changed my major.

22:03.071 --> 22:06.296
From the time I came until I graduated, until I'm working today.

22:07.558 --> 22:09.641
And, well, emphasis, yes, but not major.

22:10.402 --> 22:11.484
I majored in agronomy.

22:12.966 --> 22:14.548
And why did I major in agronomy?

22:16.491 --> 22:18.334
Well, of course, I'd grown up on the farm.

22:18.434 --> 22:19.816
I was interested in agriculture.

22:19.876 --> 22:21.799
I thought I might want to go back to the farm.

22:23.787 --> 22:27.433
But I didn't want to, I didn't like dehorning cattle.

22:27.514 --> 22:33.484
I didn't like castrating pigs and giving animal shots, that kind of thing, not my cup of tea.

22:34.606 --> 22:47.128
And this sophomore who I came down with, I'd talked to him some in the, and I guess in the year when he was back home and other things about, and found out he was majored in agronomy.

22:48.357 --> 22:50.379
And he told me that was a good major.

22:50.399 --> 22:51.080
That's how I chose it.

22:52.221 --> 22:56.066
Just because I didn't know half the majors they had.

22:56.607 --> 22:57.788
I just knew agriculture.

22:59.129 --> 23:01.252
I didn't know all the different options.

23:01.332 --> 23:03.034
I just knew I didn't want animal science.

23:03.314 --> 23:05.857
That's made a lot of agronomists.

23:05.877 --> 23:16.369
So at that point, you didn't know yet whether your goal was to be back in production agriculture or in academic.

23:16.449 --> 23:16.930
That's right.

23:17.804 --> 23:24.514
And I think it was more likely at that point to be back in production agriculture.

23:25.216 --> 23:30.003
Please share any memories you have of those first classes.

23:30.844 --> 23:35.452
What were they like and the teachers and any lasting impressions?

23:35.472 --> 23:36.814
What was the routine of class?

23:39.798 --> 23:40.459
Oh, golly.

23:42.543 --> 23:44.706
I honestly don't remember

23:45.918 --> 23:49.444
any specific teacher I had the first semester.

23:51.328 --> 23:56.236
I remember the second semester, we had to take, they had orientation classes you had to take.

23:57.979 --> 24:06.595
And in the second semester, I had to take a course on, oh golly, something about civilization.

24:08.598 --> 24:10.862
I thought it was absolutely the most boring.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.140
class I ever had in my life.

24:13.421 --> 24:16.325
Had a D in basic at mid-semester.

24:16.806 --> 24:17.627
Scared me to death.

24:18.789 --> 24:20.391
I'd make, have a D in basic.

24:20.892 --> 24:23.415
Either the first or second semester, I took botany 101.

24:23.716 --> 24:28.483
And I don't remember, I can't, I can't tell you the name of that teacher.

24:29.865 --> 24:38.217
A relatively good lecturer, but, but as far as a major academic course other than P. Chem that I took after I was in graduate school,

24:39.563 --> 24:45.908
That botany course was the most difficult thing I ever took in my life to get my hands on for some reason.

24:46.249 --> 24:54.456
I'm definitely not so much a plant-oriented person and I just had an awful time with botany class.

24:55.096 --> 25:08.828
But I took, when we came down they tested us about placing and they had what they called a chemistry 109 and there was a chemistry 101, 102.

25:09.213 --> 25:14.360
If you tested well enough, when you came down, they would put you in chemistry 109.

25:15.281 --> 25:19.927
So you get out of freshman chemistry in one semester rather than put two semesters in it.

25:19.967 --> 25:24.232
I'd had high school chemistry, but I had a basketball coach.

25:25.634 --> 25:35.226
And I thought at the time it was practically a worthless course because he talked about basketball in high school at least two-thirds of the hour.

25:35.246 --> 25:37.549
But he did give us a quiz every day.

25:37.867 --> 25:41.554
And he made us learn how to balance chemical equations.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.117
He made us learn chemical symbols.

25:43.157 --> 25:45.622
He made us learn valences and all these kinds of things.

25:46.844 --> 25:54.559
And much to my utter and complete surprise, when I came down to A&M and took that test, they put me in chemistry 109.

25:54.809 --> 25:56.792
I was absolutely dumbfounded.

25:57.273 --> 26:01.859
I remember that was one of the courses I had the first semester, but it was no problem.

26:01.940 --> 26:04.804
I don't remember anything negative about it.

26:04.944 --> 26:07.007
I remember I had to be average first semester.

26:07.187 --> 26:08.169
And you don't know who taught it?

26:08.810 --> 26:09.891
No, I don't.

26:09.911 --> 26:10.512
I sure don't.

26:11.494 --> 26:18.945
So you didn't, as far as you recall, you didn't have that first semester, any of the legendary... No.

26:18.965 --> 26:19.786
No, I don't think so.

26:20.347 --> 26:21.108
I don't think so.

26:21.649 --> 26:23.331
I had some...

26:23.783 --> 26:28.988
I don't remember exactly when I took Zoology 107, but I had Dobson for that.

26:30.990 --> 26:40.319
And I don't remember any nickname, that kind of thing, for Dr. Dobson, but I remember him as being a really good teacher.

26:40.640 --> 26:47.626
As far as you understood, what were the rules of behavior, dress and behavior at A&M for going to class?

26:49.068 --> 26:51.310
Well, for almost all of us to wear a uniform.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.826
Well, we didn't have to think about what to put on in the morning.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.088
And it had to pass inspection.

26:57.809 --> 27:00.191
So the brass had to be shined, the shoes shined.

27:01.973 --> 27:04.315
You had winter uniform, summer uniform.

27:07.398 --> 27:10.621
Now that I think about it, you ask about when we first start.

27:10.741 --> 27:16.987
Well, one of the things I remember about that first week is standing in line to get those uniform issues.

27:17.668 --> 27:21.111
That was a terrible experience.

27:21.732 --> 27:35.785
Of course, we had those old barracks buildings, and there was a, as best I can remember, a one-story long, it would be, I would say roughly where Blocker Building is now, that it was a warehouse.

27:35.885 --> 27:39.368
It was kind of a warehouse, and they had all these uniforms in that warehouse.

27:40.229 --> 27:44.293
The organization for issuing those uniforms was horrible.

27:44.934 --> 27:49.798
And of course, if you remember the fall of 1951, we were just in the,

27:50.335 --> 27:56.825
good middle or start of the drought period, and it was hotter than the Hammers of Hades down here.

27:57.767 --> 27:59.990
No air conditioning in those dorms.

28:00.671 --> 28:03.135
There's hardly any air conditioning on campus.

28:03.175 --> 28:07.662
The place I remember as air conditioning was Memorial Student Center, which had been open the year before.

28:08.403 --> 28:11.408
I think that was the only place air conditioned, any place.

28:12.610 --> 28:18.098
Maybe a few research labs that were with window air conditioners, but other than that,

28:18.719 --> 28:21.824
And so we had to go over to this warehouse to get our uniform.

28:21.844 --> 28:23.787
You had to stand outside in line.

28:24.949 --> 28:35.967
And that, of course, people would get so frustrated because you could stand in line half the day and get within five or ten of the door and somebody would come out and say, well, we're going to take these ten.

28:36.007 --> 28:37.109
We're closed up for today.

28:37.129 --> 28:38.391
You have to come back the next day.

28:39.012 --> 28:45.503
So people would write all kinds of words of wit along the wall, outside wall of this building, and that was,

28:46.057 --> 28:53.226
provided a little levity as you slowly migrated along, get in, and see what somebody had written up there two or three days before.

28:53.286 --> 29:00.154
They'd talk about how many died here the previous day and all kinds of smart remarks and comments.

29:00.835 --> 29:03.678
But we stood in line for everything.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.201
Of course, that's happened until fairly recent years.

29:06.742 --> 29:12.669
I used to always advise freshmen, even after I came back, if you see a line, get in it.

29:12.689 --> 29:15.152
There must be something on it for you at the other end.

29:15.790 --> 29:25.265
All right, in the classroom, what were the standard behavior rules, written or unwritten?

29:25.285 --> 29:26.608
Oh, I don't remember anything.

29:26.908 --> 29:30.714
I don't remember any kind of discipline problem or anything.

29:30.834 --> 29:33.559
But some people let folks sleep, go to sleep in their class.

29:33.799 --> 29:34.601
Oh, they did?

29:34.981 --> 29:35.843
That kind of thing.

29:36.183 --> 29:42.253
But as far as, I don't think discipline was even considered to be a problem.

29:42.875 --> 29:43.215
ever.

29:43.896 --> 29:46.158
What about if you had an unscheduled afternoon?

29:46.218 --> 29:47.479
What did you and your buddies do?

29:51.743 --> 29:53.304
Gosh, I don't remember such a thing.

29:53.324 --> 29:56.267
I really don't.

29:57.808 --> 30:00.691
I mean, I had class virtually every morning, every afternoon.

30:00.731 --> 30:03.554
They'd probably try to catch sleep if they could.

30:04.615 --> 30:10.620
On Saturdays, we could go to Guy and Hall and go to the movies and

30:10.870 --> 30:13.413
As I recall, sometimes they had triple feature.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.755
You got over there early enough after lunch.

30:15.855 --> 30:20.340
On Saturday, you could see the afternoon feature, the evening, the late evening for 35 cents.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.581
You might see three movies.

30:22.783 --> 30:28.108
Anytime a monkey showed up on the screen, you'd hear 100 to 150 people say, hey, old lady.

30:29.069 --> 30:30.691
Roommates were referred to as old ladies.

30:30.891 --> 30:31.512
Hey, old lady.

30:33.214 --> 30:36.237
No, most cars, we didn't have cars.

30:36.706 --> 30:39.133
We didn't have any way to even get into Bryan.

30:39.574 --> 30:44.127
Do you remember when you went back home the first time that fall?

30:44.387 --> 30:45.831
Oh yeah, I surely do.

30:46.493 --> 30:48.960
After I'd been down here only 10 days.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.171
They let us go home for the weekend.

30:51.331 --> 30:52.794
That's before classes started.

30:53.115 --> 30:57.484
They let us go home that last weekend after, well, they call it now, FOB week or something.

30:57.524 --> 31:05.780
But anyway, we came down, as I recall, on a Tuesday or Wednesday, and then we were here through that weekend, and all the next week we got to go home.

31:06.942 --> 31:08.645
Yeah, I remember it pretty well.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.050
Had to ride a bus.

31:12.025 --> 31:16.729
And there was no easy way to get to Honeygrove, Texas on the bus.

31:16.749 --> 31:22.835
We went from College Station to Waco to Dallas to Sherman, and my parents met me in Sherman, Texas.

31:25.478 --> 31:31.143
It was, I think it took me 22 hours to get to Sherman.

31:32.865 --> 31:40.632
And I had lost, I want to say 18 pounds, but I'd lost enough weight

31:40.983 --> 31:43.586
that I must have looked a fright to my parents.

31:45.208 --> 31:55.561
My mother told me later that if I had uttered one word about wanting to stay home, that there would have been no squabbling at all.

31:55.721 --> 31:56.882
They would have let me stay home.

31:57.563 --> 32:06.754
I don't remember how I got back to campus, but I suspect, I can't remember if I rode the bus back.

32:07.612 --> 32:10.637
But I suspect they took me to Dallas and I caught the train.

32:11.098 --> 32:19.132
I did that a number of times thereafter because there was a train that left Dallas at 5 o'clock on Sunday afternoon and pulled back in here at 8.

32:19.653 --> 32:21.215
That was not a bad time.

32:22.497 --> 32:24.901
And a lot of Aggies rode that train.

32:26.083 --> 32:28.808
But I hitchhiked some, not very much.

32:29.149 --> 32:30.531
I hitchhiked some.

32:31.135 --> 32:36.883
But, yeah, that's the first time I went home, and I don't know if I went home again before Thanksgiving or not.

32:36.903 --> 32:38.925
I probably didn't.

32:38.945 --> 32:41.229
Had you ever hitchhiked before coming to A&M?

32:41.369 --> 32:41.569
No.

32:44.152 --> 32:47.737
What did your family think about your hitchhiking?

32:47.757 --> 32:53.084
I don't think they thought very favorably of it, but they didn't think very much 22 hours on the bus either.

32:53.825 --> 32:57.210
Did you ever have any negative experience hitchhiking?

32:59.013 --> 33:02.159
Well, I've ridden with drunks before, driving.

33:04.783 --> 33:09.372
I had, the scariest ride I ever had was between Dallas and Greenville one time.

33:09.752 --> 33:15.202
They would generally meet us in Greenville if we hitchhiked, but that was frightening.

33:15.222 --> 33:19.149
I wanted to get out of that vehicle almost as soon as I'd gotten any.

33:20.051 --> 33:22.455
I had a friend from Paris, Texas who,

33:22.722 --> 33:25.785
Hitchhiked a lot more than I did over the years.

33:26.205 --> 33:31.470
And of course, yeah, you could have some, I've heard of really horrible experiences.

33:32.891 --> 33:39.037
And was there in almost every town a known location where Aggies hitchhiked?

33:39.057 --> 33:39.577
Absolutely.

33:40.558 --> 33:50.147
We had a known, at Eastgate, where if you were going to hitchhike away from here, north or south, you were supposed to go to Eastgate and stand in line and

33:50.887 --> 33:56.814
People didn't do it, but in Dallas and Waco and Houston, yeah, there were hitchhiking points.

33:57.394 --> 34:10.950
And you were really, if you got a ride inside that hitchhiking point at the town, you were supposed to get out when you got to the point and let whoever was first in line take your place.

34:11.871 --> 34:17.417
Generally, I think people just got down real low in the car when they passed hitchhiking point and kept coming.

34:17.836 --> 34:19.258
But that was the rule.

34:19.418 --> 34:21.060
Everybody understood that would be the rule.

34:21.761 --> 34:23.744
And rank did not matter at those.

34:23.764 --> 34:24.245
That's right.

34:24.745 --> 34:24.966
No.

34:25.266 --> 34:32.836
Did anybody ever try to pay off and give the guys in front of them a little extra money to get to be first?

34:33.036 --> 34:33.617
Never saw it.

34:33.817 --> 34:34.398
I've never heard.

34:34.598 --> 34:36.501
Nobody's ever mentioned it in any of these interviews.

34:36.881 --> 34:37.903
No, never heard of it.

34:40.446 --> 34:40.847
Let's see.

34:42.409 --> 34:44.772
During your undergraduate years,

34:44.752 --> 34:49.236
There must have been, you mentioned one good drown out routine.

34:49.477 --> 34:52.299
There must have been other jokes, pranks, good bull.

34:52.380 --> 34:53.260
Share some of those.

34:53.981 --> 34:56.464
Whether you knew, whether you were involved in them or not.

34:57.084 --> 35:13.240
Well, probably the, one of the worst things I was involved in, well I remember several things, but first in sophomore year, we were in dorm 12, which is beside Duncan Hall on the west side.

35:14.620 --> 35:22.030
And Governor Jester, Richard Jester was governor at the time, and he came over for some event.

35:22.911 --> 35:25.354
Anyway, he was going to make a speech in Knuckin Hall.

35:26.776 --> 35:35.548
And I was a sophomore at that time, and we had a, our sophomore, we were in a, I would say I was in a

35:36.929 --> 35:38.771
a liberal outfit as things go.

35:38.811 --> 35:43.256
There was far more emphasis on academics and athletics than there was on military.

35:43.637 --> 35:46.901
We were not a very military outfit.

35:46.921 --> 35:51.045
But we were good academically and we were good athletically.

35:51.125 --> 35:55.050
And we had two or three guys that were really cut up.

35:55.070 --> 36:01.137
So one of the sophomores decided that he was gonna drown out Governor Buford Jester.

36:01.738 --> 36:05.502
That he could get him from the north end of the dorm.

36:06.595 --> 36:21.649
I don't think he actually threw the water, but it was to hear that being planned and just feeling what could happen to us if one of our buddies drowned out the governor.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.532
That was a scary, that was a scary deal.

36:26.714 --> 36:36.163
When I was a junior, there were some cannon, a couple of cannon that were displayed over here by Walton Hall, these old field cannon.

36:37.257 --> 36:39.920
And we decided we were in dorm seven at that time.

36:41.741 --> 36:51.511
And we decided that for football on football weekend, having those cannon in front of dorm seven would be an appropriate thing rather than having them in front of Walton Hall.

36:53.733 --> 37:00.660
So we got mostly sophomores, bearing in mind, freshmen weren't even over there with us.

37:00.680 --> 37:04.564
So the sophomores in the outfit, we were probably 25 or 30 of us.

37:05.843 --> 37:07.885
And maybe we had some juniors in with us.

37:08.045 --> 37:11.188
I don't remember all the details, but we went to Walton Hall.

37:11.349 --> 37:17.695
I don't remember how we dislodged those cannons and what was done there, but we rolled, manually rolled those cannons.

37:17.715 --> 37:34.112
Wonder one of us hadn't gotten killed, because it was really, it was dangerous to roll those heavy things, but we rolled them from Walton Hall to our dorm, and so when everybody woke up Saturday morning, we had the cannon in front of our dorm, and held the pay, too.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.186
because they fell us right out.

37:38.488 --> 37:43.334
And before marching in for the football game or anything, guess what we got to do?

37:44.195 --> 37:47.479
Roll those cannons back to Washington Hall.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.442
But we had our moment of glory with them.

37:49.662 --> 37:51.404
We enjoyed that.

37:54.168 --> 37:56.691
What about any tricks on upperclassmen?

37:59.495 --> 38:03.660
Oh, I guess drowned outs were the most common thing that happened.

38:07.370 --> 38:18.443
We had somebody pull their heads on some commodes when we were juniors in dorm seven and almost floated us out.

38:18.923 --> 38:25.431
I think we attributed that to the jocks, the cavalry, they were a rough bunch of customers.

38:25.931 --> 38:31.478
We really weren't, that quartermaster outfit was not much of a hell raising outfit.

38:31.578 --> 38:35.402
We were, as I say, there was much more emphasis on

38:35.872 --> 38:39.777
academics and athletics than there was a lot of hell raising.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.601
I've had two or three people tell me about a fish day.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.343
Was there a fish day when you were?

38:46.285 --> 38:48.568
Yeah, I think there was.

38:49.089 --> 38:52.133
When freshmen take sophomore privileges or something.

38:56.098 --> 38:59.162
I don't remember any particular instances about that.

39:00.464 --> 39:05.490
Mess Hall, there were several

39:05.993 --> 39:30.195
back when I was a freshman there were several freshmen in our outfit that were from Beaumont or in the immediate vicinity of Beaumont and they had a lot of friends who were sophomores and juniors and those friends would come over and eat with us in Cebisa when they let sophomores come over and eat with us and we didn't like them most of us not from a Beaumont area didn't like them very much because

39:30.665 --> 39:35.612
They tended to scheme with their fish buddies and take the kush away from the rest of us.

39:35.632 --> 39:37.955
We had kush questions, as you know, in those days.

39:37.975 --> 39:40.118
What were some kush questions?

39:40.138 --> 39:45.746
Oh, how many buildings faced true north and south on the campus?

39:47.529 --> 39:53.938
How many lights were in the ceiling of Sabisa Hall?

39:56.416 --> 40:00.644
Well, they could ask you the day that any building on the campus was built.

40:00.664 --> 40:01.366
That was fair.

40:02.789 --> 40:07.718
Now, was there a correct answer to any question?

40:07.899 --> 40:10.604
Oh, yeah, there were correct answers to all those questions.

40:10.684 --> 40:11.506
You bet there were.

40:11.906 --> 40:16.315
Yeah, there were only, in those days, there were only three buildings that faced true north and south.

40:17.172 --> 40:19.315
or east-west, true direction.

40:19.335 --> 40:32.894
Well, there was the Trigon, the Trigon, the front of it is true west direction, and the front of the Evans Building over here, and Evans, Bell, Bell, Bell Building, one over here on the corner.

40:33.935 --> 40:35.858
That's a true, and what was the other one?

40:37.119 --> 40:39.322
I think it was Austin or Pfeiffer Hall, one.

40:40.784 --> 40:41.986
They're no longer here.

40:42.327 --> 40:46.352
Like I've heard, how many stars are there in the Texas flag?

40:47.142 --> 40:49.745
And if you say one, they say no, it's two.

40:49.805 --> 40:50.726
There's one on each side.

40:51.027 --> 40:53.410
And if you say two, they say no, there's one.

40:53.490 --> 40:54.471
It goes all the way through.

40:55.913 --> 40:56.754
I hadn't heard that.

40:56.854 --> 41:00.598
Well, they had a lot of tricks to Kush questions.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.803
If an upperclassman didn't want you to eat Kush, you didn't eat Kush.

41:04.823 --> 41:06.665
I mean, it was that simple.

41:07.026 --> 41:08.688
You could know a lot of campusology.

41:08.728 --> 41:10.971
They gave us a book of campusology.

41:12.092 --> 41:13.774
So you expected to know the book.

41:14.547 --> 41:15.929
That was given to you early?

41:16.209 --> 41:17.010
Oh, yes.

41:17.030 --> 41:19.955
Probably that first week when we were down here before crisis started.

41:20.876 --> 41:26.884
What were some of the nicknames for Aggie names for various food and beverage?

41:28.767 --> 41:37.019
Well, a lot of those are on the wall over there in the MSC in Hill's carvings.

41:37.039 --> 41:40.183
And some of those, bread was gun wadding.

41:41.176 --> 41:56.711
Iced tea was stud and eggs were cackle and ketchup was blood and, well, let's see, milk was lachy and hot chocolate was, what do they call it?

41:58.793 --> 41:59.753
Mud, I guess.

42:03.777 --> 42:04.798
Mustard was baby.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.883
Was fried chicken, what was chicken?

42:12.057 --> 42:13.298
Yeah, I don't remember.

42:13.419 --> 42:15.080
We call meat bull neck, but I don't remember.

42:15.181 --> 42:16.682
Yeah, but chicken wasn't bull neck.

42:16.702 --> 42:17.143
No, I don't remember.

42:17.163 --> 42:18.484
Was there anything for sausage?

42:21.628 --> 42:22.068
Bacon?

42:22.429 --> 42:23.170
Don't remember.

42:23.590 --> 42:24.271
Don't remember.

42:25.332 --> 42:25.793
Gravy?

42:25.833 --> 42:30.278
Yeah, what was the name for gravy?

42:34.042 --> 42:36.645
It was widely believed, incidentally.

42:36.665 --> 42:38.267
It was widely believed.

42:38.652 --> 42:42.418
that any gravy was laced with saltpeter.

42:45.363 --> 42:47.126
So not a lot of gravy was used.

42:51.373 --> 42:52.956
And as far as we know, that was a myth.

42:53.457 --> 42:54.999
Yeah, as far as I know, that was a myth.

42:56.262 --> 43:00.609
What was your impression of the food, the quality of the food?

43:00.629 --> 43:04.255
Generally quite good, if you got to eat it.

43:05.298 --> 43:11.146
Sometimes, as a freshman, you didn't have much opportunity to eat it or chew it.

43:11.166 --> 43:13.669
What would be the circumstances that would keep you from it?

43:13.909 --> 43:23.001
Well, there was such a thing as a square meal, which was not often, but I've seen people have to do square meals.

43:23.602 --> 43:26.105
There was such a thing as being in a hurry.

43:26.286 --> 43:28.148
All of us ate at exactly the same time.

43:29.390 --> 43:33.415
At 12 noon, you had lunch, or 12, 15, whatever it was.

43:33.800 --> 43:36.423
And many of us had class at one.

43:36.643 --> 43:41.047
And we marched in, and it was served family style.

43:41.267 --> 43:51.758
We had student waiters, usually 10 of us at a table, seniors on the end, freshmen would be on the hot corner or sophomore if you were over in the other area.

43:52.618 --> 44:03.469
And so if you start getting harassed from an upperclassman, you might sit there to brace half the meal and not have much opportunity to eat.

44:04.073 --> 44:07.718
But generally, generally, I thought the food was quite good.

44:09.260 --> 44:14.727
The thing that I found most distasteful just from appearance was roast beef.

44:14.747 --> 44:19.212
They used to serve us sliced real thin and have all the colors of the rainbow in it.

44:19.292 --> 44:23.278
I just never thought that roast beef ought to have all the colors of the rainbow in it.

44:24.199 --> 44:30.387
And I don't know that it would necessarily always taste so bad, but the appearance was not very appealing.

44:30.667 --> 44:31.448
But I thought

44:32.356 --> 44:33.638
We ate reasonably well.

44:33.718 --> 44:37.203
Did you have some favorite foods and desserts?

44:39.347 --> 44:44.555
Well, coconut cream pie is one of my favorite desserts, always has been.

44:45.216 --> 44:46.317
We had it occasionally.

44:49.382 --> 44:51.385
I loved it any time we had fish.

44:52.427 --> 44:54.410
I love fish and I love fried fish.

44:55.151 --> 44:57.334
Once in a blue moon, we'd get steak.

44:57.354 --> 45:00.439
That was a real treat.

45:01.786 --> 45:03.128
Fried chicken wasn't bad.

45:05.591 --> 45:15.365
I don't remember that much about foods, you know, that I especially liked or didn't like.

45:16.467 --> 45:22.876
I guess that roast beef was what I least liked to see on the platter.

45:22.896 --> 45:28.063
When did you begin to feel like, okay, this is going to work out, this is my place?

45:30.659 --> 45:39.870
Yes, because I knew from almost the day I got here, I wasn't, you know, they could talk to us about who was going to stay and who was going to leave and that kind of thing.

45:41.211 --> 45:47.238
But I determined very early on no upperclassman was going to have the privilege of running me off.

45:48.039 --> 45:49.661
So that you never doubted.

45:49.801 --> 45:54.186
I never, you know, I doubted sometimes how much I was going to enjoy it.

45:54.706 --> 45:56.769
but I never doubted I was gonna stick.

45:56.789 --> 46:00.113
I don't think I ever thought about not sticking.

46:00.875 --> 46:04.580
First of all, there were just too high expectations from home.

46:05.040 --> 46:13.252
Even though my mother and dad would let me stay home that weekend, it would've, particularly my dad, he would've been crushed.

46:13.932 --> 46:17.678
It would've crushed my dad for his son not to stick it.

46:19.220 --> 46:23.025
So I never, I never, I don't ever remember giving a thought

46:23.562 --> 46:26.145
And you didn't have any grade troubles ever.

46:27.087 --> 46:28.008
No, not really.

46:29.089 --> 46:29.510
Not really.

46:30.631 --> 46:39.383
Now that, my, one of the three freshmen that I had a room with at first semester, he flunked out.

46:40.424 --> 46:41.926
He's the experienced guy.

46:42.146 --> 46:47.033
I mean, he couldn't, he just couldn't discipline himself to do the study.

46:47.073 --> 46:48.034
Very bright guy.

46:48.537 --> 46:51.821
And surprisingly enough, somebody that I stay in touch with to this day.

46:52.982 --> 46:54.464
Exchange Christmas cards every year.

46:55.165 --> 47:01.232
I've only seen him one time since the end of the semester in 1950.

47:02.914 --> 47:07.079
Well, it'd be 50, when I came down to 51, yeah.

47:07.419 --> 47:09.902
So it'd be January of 52, I've seen him one time.

47:11.023 --> 47:15.068
Did you develop early on
