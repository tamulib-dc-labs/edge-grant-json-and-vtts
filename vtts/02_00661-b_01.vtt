WEBVTT

00:09.548 --> 00:26.255
Was there any sort of exchange or let's say group 
criticism of papers in those early years at Woods

00:09.548 --> 00:26.255
Hole?

00:26.275 --> 00:29.380
No, about the only criticism was that There was 
the, we were free to publish without any

00:30.912 --> 00:40.604
supervision, but there was a thing called Woods 
Hole Contribution Number. In order to get a Woods

00:40.624 --> 00:49.876
Hole Contribution Number, you had to hand it to the 
director and he would read it and say, okay, we have

00:40.624 --> 00:49.876
a Woods Hole Contribution Number. So there was a 
great, there was that kind of indirect gimmick for

00:49.896 --> 00:59.267
getting the papers supervised a little bit. But 
No, right at the very beginning there was no, there

01:01.102 --> 01:11.539
was no

01:01.102 --> 01:11.539
really helpful review process. The Woods Hole 
published a series called Papers in Physical

01:11.559 --> 01:17.389
Oceanology and Meteorology, Those were largely 
reviewed for good English and so forth by the

01:17.808 --> 01:24.375
editor of that. He was also the business manager 
and also an archaeologist who spent most of his

01:24.395 --> 01:28.599
time at Harvard. He only had one business manager. 
He was part town.

01:35.006 --> 01:43.575
He had a secretary in later years who did all the 
purchasing and personnel and everything else. I

01:43.595 --> 01:43.815
guess the The first thing I ever wrote was not a 
scientific paper. The first thing I ever wrote was

01:46.869 --> 01:52.094
a book, a popular book about oceanography. It was 
before I came to the Oceanographic Institution.

01:55.017 --> 01:56.859
It was probably a brilliant politic thing to do. 
You know, you don't sort of write a book about

01:56.879 --> 02:00.563
medicine and then go to medical school. But I went, 
I had, without some trouble, I wrote a book, a

02:00.583 --> 02:08.551
popular book on oceanography called Science of 
the Seven Seas. It was published by Cornell

02:08.571 --> 02:12.435
Maritime Press in 1945, and I wrote a book about it. 
I came to Woods Hole and was kind of embarrassed by

02:13.715 --> 02:19.442
it, why I didn't like it very much. And so I thought 
maybe I ought to go to Scripps and get some kind of an

02:19.462 --> 02:29.034
education

02:19.462 --> 02:29.034
in oceanography. I swear to have seen the book, 
unfortunately. And so he wouldn't let me come in on

02:31.757 --> 02:38.085
account of the book, and basically he was kind of 
disgusting to me. told that to say it wasn't all

02:38.757 --> 02:43.604
that bad at all. But I don't have a copy anymore and I 
think there's a few, I know a few people have one.

02:48.430 --> 02:52.256
Warren Wister has one, George Deacon has one. It's 
a great challenge. But I don't

02:54.038 --> 02:58.224
know. I guess it only took me about three weekends 
to write And, of course, spread it and worked very

03:01.825 --> 03:11.157
hard on his book, which came out the same

03:01.825 --> 03:11.157
time. It sold quite well. I think it made about 
$5,000 out of it. At that time, my first salary was

03:16.584 --> 03:21.370
always $1,300. So $5,000 was quite a lot of money to 
make. I don't know any copies around it. I'd

03:27.478 --> 03:31.123
systematically destroy them if I could find them. 
What prompted the writing of that book? Well,

03:34.751 --> 03:38.636
that's the interest of the field when I was doing 
that. That got me interested. That's

03:40.338 --> 03:44.003
the interest of the field. I looked around the 
libraries and found various things. Copycom

03:46.786 --> 03:54.797
stepped out and

03:46.786 --> 03:54.797
rewrote it. And then began the scientific papers. 
Yeah, that was the first thing I wrote. That took me

03:59.915 --> 04:05.382
about two years to get started.

04:12.110 --> 04:15.575
What about people outside of Woods Hole? What kind 
of contact did you have with them?

04:20.922 --> 04:23.605
That's interesting.

04:28.057 --> 04:28.658
Very little. I had, I know that, that Islin asked 
VanArts and me to teach his course in Harvard once

04:29.038 --> 04:41.514
or twice, which we did in 1948-49. And I had a, and I 
taught for one or two years,

04:41.694 --> 04:56.612
by going once a week to Yale in a, in a in a general

04:57.065 --> 05:09.477
science course that was held in front of the 
geological departments. I think that might have

05:09.497 --> 05:15.963
been something like 1951, something

05:09.497 --> 05:15.963
of that sort, around that period. But at those 
times we had almost no contacts outside. And then

05:19.327 --> 05:24.692
we, about 1955, The meteorological project that 
the Neumann had at Princeton broke up. And Johnny

05:31.710 --> 05:37.076
and Phillips came from there to MIT. And right 
away, we began to have a going relation with the

05:37.096 --> 05:47.227
people there at MIT. And so every two weeks, we'd 
have a meeting. and give some informal papers

05:50.963 --> 05:58.213
about what we were working on. They were quite 
informal at that time. And we'd have, it was

06:00.797 --> 06:11.892
Fridays, we'd have the meetings every two weeks, 
either at MIT or down here at Woods Hole, starting

06:00.797 --> 06:11.892
around 1955, I guess. And that was very good. It got 
people like C.C. Lynn and Lou Howard and others

06:17.214 --> 06:22.904
interested in the, involved.

06:24.387 --> 06:34.605
And the,

06:24.387 --> 06:34.605
that's become more institutionalized as time has 
gone on and somewhat more formal. People are sort

06:35.193 --> 06:45.925
of scared to talk at night because there's so many 
high-powered people sitting around trying to

06:35.193 --> 06:45.925
shoot you down. Don't you think people are a little 
bit scared? Yeah, I think so. But it didn't used to

06:49.669 --> 06:53.153
be that way.

06:54.875 --> 07:04.626
So that was a very important thing to us 
intellectually, was that contact with the

06:54.875 --> 07:04.626
meteorology and mathematics department at MIT. 
Well, that's a fair number at the mathematics

07:05.129 --> 07:10.299
department. For example, one might not think so, 
but if you look at the publications that have come

07:10.380 --> 07:22.885
out of the math department, there's a very 
well-known book on rotating fluids that Harvey

07:10.380 --> 07:22.885
Greenspan wrote, for example. Well, that would 
never have come if he hadn't had the contact with

07:23.793 --> 07:42.771
rotating fluid mechanical people that he had 
through these weekend seminars, these

07:23.793 --> 07:42.771
end-of-the-week seminars.

07:42.791 --> 07:50.678
The one way that we managed to keep other people 
interested was that those things had never been

07:42.791 --> 07:50.678
restricted to oceanography. been a little bit 
broader, so meteorologists or astrophysicists

07:51.164 --> 08:04.840
or something go dark out there as well, as long as 
there was some kind of large-scale fluid dynamics

07:51.164 --> 08:04.840
problem.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.263
I thought you were going to say the way you kept them 
interesting is you served beer. Well, yeah. Well,

08:08.365 --> 08:10.607
actually, we didn't serve beer. We served better 
things than that afterwards, but they had, but

08:10.627 --> 08:16.494
then we'd go to a restaurant or something. Yeah, 
that was one of the problems. We always managed to

08:19.480 --> 08:31.801
find some money at Woods Hole so we could have 
martinis or something, but at MIT they never seem

08:19.480 --> 08:31.801
to be able to have a slush fund, so it was a great 
source of embarrassment for people at MIT.

08:31.841 --> 08:34.405
Harvard was rather good that way. They could 
always come up with something. But in the early

08:38.512 --> 08:42.298
days it wasn't Harvard, it was MIT and Woods Hole. 
the first four or five years. How often

08:46.793 --> 08:52.200
did these meet, once a month? Twice a month. Twice a 
month, okay. Just about once a month. Quite

08:55.925 --> 08:56.846
exciting. Winter times, snow storms, it's quite 
exciting. They weren't so very big, you know,

08:58.428 --> 09:11.025
perhaps two cars might

08:58.428 --> 09:11.025
drive up from here. Four to eight people or 
something would go up each time and go down. Sort of

09:12.446 --> 09:12.927
groups, I guess. I think it was might

09:13.345 --> 09:28.433
have been 15 or 18 people. As you leave Woods Hole 
and moved first to Harvard, then MIT, did it seem to

09:32.870 --> 09:50.001
you as if the number of contacts that you were 
making narrowed, that you don't seem to have as

09:32.870 --> 09:50.001
much outside input as you thought you

09:32.870 --> 09:50.001
did?

09:57.203 --> 10:14.803
Well, I think, I think I really probably, that's a 
little bit interesting, I think I've never made a

09:57.203 --> 10:14.803
very, at any time did I make a very serious effort to 
broaden my contacts at either Harvard or MIT.

10:17.266 --> 10:23.633
I think I've had a tendency to

10:26.161 --> 10:36.450
maintain contacts at Woods Hole as strongly as I 
could.

10:36.470 --> 10:53.965
By the way, I've kind of been a little bit of an 
outsider at Woods Hole for 17 years now, but

10:36.470 --> 10:53.965
I guess I'm the only guy that's worked here for 17 
years, the past 17 years without ever getting any

10:36.470 --> 10:53.965
salary from the place. But But

10:55.405 --> 11:13.510
by being here a good fraction of the time, it means 
that I don't have the, I can go into MIT faculty, but

10:55.405 --> 11:13.510
I would not know most

10:55.405 --> 11:13.510
people. I wouldn't be sure if I went to some kind of a 
party event.

11:20.093 --> 11:30.308
What was your reaction as a scientist in the 1960s 
involved in oceanography when you began to

11:20.093 --> 11:30.308
receive pressure from your students to eliminate 
your work with defense research? Well, I was

11:30.328 --> 11:36.617
always sort of double-minded about defense 
research. I accepted the necessity for doing a

11:36.637 --> 11:42.185
certain amount of it. I didn't

11:42.205 --> 11:47.012
really want to work it. defense research at all. I 
registered as a conscientious objector, and so I

11:52.812 --> 12:14.502
had probably didn't do any secret research after I 
gave the infrared thing over to Bill Richeson in

11:52.812 --> 12:14.502
1951.

12:17.452 --> 12:34.043
I guess the reason why I came to Mattel to work on 
submarine, anti-submarine warfare was that

12:17.452 --> 12:34.043
somehow, somehow of all the things that, of all the 
circumstances under which you might really be

12:34.900 --> 12:39.587
willing to kill people would be if you were under 
attack. And the submarine seemed to me to be about

12:39.668 --> 12:47.720
as most clearly an attack weapon as many things 
could be. Dropping a hash cannon on a submarine was

12:47.740 --> 12:55.453
somehow different from dropping a bomb on 
Hamburg, for instance. And I felt that kind of, I

12:55.653 --> 12:59.980
felt that, you know, trying to find a way. of some 
kind of compromise, and it seemed to me that that

13:00.702 --> 13:11.169
was my own personal compromise that I was willing 
to make. So I really never kind of really

13:15.232 --> 13:18.857
I was rather glad not to do any military research. I 
mean, if you take someone like Walter Munk, for

13:18.917 --> 13:29.230
example, who all his life has been connected with 
chasing things, meetings, and post-sabotage

13:18.917 --> 13:29.230
missiles, and I don't know what things all his 
life. I very early, I very early found it somewhat

13:29.911 --> 13:36.700
distasteful and decided to try to avoid it. But I 
also didn't really want to make a big thing of it

13:36.680 --> 14:01.263
because I'm not so absolutely confident that my 
own personal view is a one that everybody in the

13:36.680 --> 14:01.263
country can afford to espouse and all these moral 
things are kind of valid. And so I never could make a

14:06.430 --> 14:16.685
a very good argument for pacifism, except it was 
something which was personally very strong in me.

14:16.705 --> 14:28.202
And so, on

14:16.705 --> 14:28.202
the other hand, when we're all, when there were 
student

14:28.435 --> 14:46.083
unrest and riots and so

14:28.435 --> 14:46.083
forth, I didn't really try to associate

14:28.435 --> 14:46.083
myself with those either. We were people who 
wanted to become leaders of elements, pacifists

14:46.103 --> 14:49.168
or something like that, so I wasn't doing any... I 
didn't feel vulnerable from students, but I

14:49.188 --> 14:50.450
didn't... I was kind of curious, you know. In a way, 
I didn't really... I found some of their behavior

14:54.305 --> 15:00.475
kind of distasteful. I went to Yale to get an 
honorary degree once and the ROTC students were

15:00.495 --> 15:15.520
there getting their commissions and the rest of 
the students there were just cheering and booing

15:00.495 --> 15:15.520
me. And,

15:16.715 --> 15:30.917
you know,

15:16.715 --> 15:30.917
I didn't like that. You know, I'd see these poor 
kids forgetting their commissions. I couldn't,

15:33.621 --> 15:34.502
I'm not that kind of a pacifist. I wanted to enjoy or 
encourage or anything like that. I was sitting

15:37.184 --> 16:03.245
next to Art Buchwald, and he said, he was 
constantly

15:37.184 --> 16:03.245
against the board, and sort of went down on me, but 
these kids were made board, he says, and these two

15:37.184 --> 16:03.245
guys, and this is awful, he said, they're the, 
they're the, those ROTC students are the, are the,

15:37.184 --> 16:03.245
are the, are the greatest people here. I guess one, 
I guess, really, basically, no matter what

16:05.905 --> 16:13.499
everybody wants to do, I always want to do 
something different. And if I happen to be in a, if I

16:13.519 --> 16:21.454
happen to be in a pacifist country,

16:13.519 --> 16:21.454
I'd probably be in a knowledgeable stance about 
that. I have a feeling that's probably true. It's a

16:24.319 --> 16:27.525
question of, you know, trying to, trying to You're 
trying to suspend judgment. You're trying not to

16:30.638 --> 16:36.746
be carried along with the crowd in some blind way. 
And so you've got an overdose of antibodies, no

16:36.766 --> 16:48.303
matter

16:36.766 --> 16:48.303
what everybody else is doing. You resist it. So I 
mean, if I were in a conservative country, I'd be a

16:50.366 --> 16:54.952
liberal. If I was in a liberal country, I'd be a 
conservative. I just know rebellious. In some

16:59.028 --> 17:03.473
way, I wouldn't want to. I'd try to see the other 
side and maybe over-emphasize it. But I wouldn't

17:07.378 --> 17:10.261
find it very strong. It would just be my own 
personal feelings about it. This is an obligatory

17:14.706 --> 17:19.211
question which you can choose not to answer. Of all 
the work you've done, what do you consider your

17:19.231 --> 17:27.441
major accomplishment?

17:27.461 --> 17:28.562
I don't know.

17:40.321 --> 18:01.284
I guess I would want to make it the thing that I 
thought was the most fun,

17:40.321 --> 18:01.284
the biggest

17:40.321 --> 18:01.284
surprise. I think... I think the thing I like the 
best, you know, it's kind of crazy, I kind of like

18:02.967 --> 18:12.497
the salt fountain the rest of everything. It's one 
of the least significant things I suppose there

18:12.578 --> 18:14.500
is. I kind of like the salt fountain the best, 
although it seems to have almost no significance

18:14.520 --> 18:20.346
in the ocean at all. I've tried rather hard

18:20.366 --> 18:26.713
to make it happen, but I kind of like it because it's 
just kind of so crazy. I think as far as most

18:28.060 --> 18:52.135
significant things are concerned, I suppose

18:28.060 --> 18:52.135
the attempts to attempt to put together some kind 
of a wind-driven model of the ocean, an attempt to

18:28.060 --> 18:52.135
build some kind of theory of thermocline, thermal 
circulation of the ocean. I guess from the

18:52.155 --> 18:57.983
objective point of view, those are the most I think 
most things, more has grown out of those

18:59.667 --> 19:05.775
than other things. Nothing

19:05.795 --> 19:11.563
much has grown out of the salt, not directly as far 
as the ocean is concerned. Comments to

19:11.583 --> 19:14.767
prospective students. What do you suppose will 
be, let's say for lack of a better word, the new hot

19:15.929 --> 19:23.519
field in oceanography? For a while, nuclear 
physicists were sort of the in-group to be. What do

19:27.384 --> 19:28.746
you think occurs next? In oceanography? In 
oceanography. Oh, yeah. Well, right now, a hot

19:36.739 --> 19:46.448
field right now is all the large-scale terminals 
and eddies.

19:47.669 --> 19:50.491
That seems to be a hot field. But I suppose that my 
feeling about a hot field is that Maybe I'm wrong.

20:03.228 --> 20:17.061
Well, there are certain obvious fields that 
people are going to go into, things which are very

20:03.228 --> 20:17.061
clearly going to happen, like an intensification 
study of equatorial phenomena, for example. But

20:17.081 --> 20:28.973
those are, it's hard to, you're not really 
predicting very much when you say those things,

20:17.081 --> 20:28.973
because those things are already beginning to 
happen.

20:30.995 --> 20:57.762
I suppose that

20:30.995 --> 20:57.762
there'll be a transformation of

20:30.995 --> 20:57.762
descriptive water mass chemical kind of 
oceanography

20:30.995 --> 20:57.762
into a quantitative science once the proper 
language

20:57.961 --> 21:19.427
and

20:57.961 --> 21:19.427
computing technique and so forth is constructed

20:57.961 --> 21:19.427
in the middle hand. If you look at this, there's a 
tremendous amount of oceanographic literature

21:19.447 --> 21:26.595
which is fairly descriptive on the basis of what 
muscles and capsules are. And the ability to

21:26.615 --> 21:27.917
marshal all that information in some kind of a of a 
systematic, balanced way so that it can, so that

21:30.226 --> 21:44.023
computations can be made easily and there's a 
range of validity. There's a susceptibility to

21:44.043 --> 21:50.171
errors and so forth that can be laid out very 
clearly. I suppose that

21:50.191 --> 21:55.778
that's going to be a

22:00.922 --> 22:19.279
something's

22:00.922 --> 22:19.279
going

22:00.922 --> 22:19.279
to happen. I can't believe that it's going to

22:19.299 --> 22:26.466
be in this chaotic qualitative state. And somehow 
some very tidy-minded, clever people are going to

22:26.486 --> 22:29.729
be able to put the whole thing together in good 
ways. But the standard This really doesn't mean

22:31.921 --> 22:34.324
field work or anything. This means just sort of a 
re-combination of certain descriptive elements

22:34.344 --> 22:43.958
that already exist. I thought that for some time. I 
don't seem to have the talents or the skills to

22:45.120 --> 22:53.932
carry it off. I think Carol Walsh is coming close to 
it. Not I don't know.

23:03.646 --> 23:09.354
It's a very big fight tonight. One feels that there 
are hundreds and hundreds of qualitative

23:09.374 --> 23:31.965
indications of what's going on in the ocean buried 
in the descriptive literature,

23:09.374 --> 23:31.965
never properly

23:09.374 --> 23:31.965
put together. I mean, it's just as though, it's 
just as though you were,

23:33.042 --> 23:47.355
it's just as though you had some kind of a very very 
badly, if you had, suppose you had a few of a

23:47.943 --> 24:04.470
crossword puzzle, of a jigsaw puzzle, but through 
some very bad diffusing eyeglasses, so you really

23:47.943 --> 24:04.470
couldn't see the fact that the pieces had 
interlocking sides, and all you could see was

23:47.943 --> 24:04.470
patterns of color and so forth. And as you looked at 
it, you might try to take all the predominantly

24:04.490 --> 24:11.081
blue ones here, and all the red ones, and the green 
ones, and move them around, something like that.

24:11.502 --> 24:12.904
See, what does this all mean? But then, as soon as 
your eyes can see the fact that there are edges

24:13.762 --> 24:23.503
which can fit together, suddenly there's a new set 
of rules to the game. And you put together this

24:23.523 --> 24:28.193
thing using hints from the covers. but not using 
the color in some other kind of way. And then all of a

24:32.818 --> 24:36.842
sudden, you can start to put the thing together. 
And I think that we have all these hints, but we

24:36.862 --> 24:55.102
don't have

24:36.862 --> 24:55.102
the proper quantitative language

24:36.862 --> 24:55.102
or something to put the things together. And at 
some stage, that may happen. It could be exciting.

24:59.662 --> 25:08.612
And all these qualitative

24:59.662 --> 25:08.612
things are very important. For example, 
Worthington just came in yesterday or the day

25:08.632 --> 25:18.124
before. I also put a print on my desk here, which is a 
paper that he just published, which is a big

25:18.144 --> 25:23.610
refutation of my business simulation model. Now, 
you know, he's had it around for several years and

25:23.978 --> 25:29.569
didn't show it to me until he got it published on 
some desk. Well, it's a very, it's a very

25:29.589 --> 25:37.145
interesting, it's a very interesting paper. He 
says that the, that the Antarctic circuit, the

25:38.327 --> 25:45.582
Antarctic bottom water isn't being formed 
anymore. It hasn't been formed. It's basically

25:52.147 --> 25:53.028
not being formed at all. Now, most of us, myself and 
many other people, have always figured that the

25:53.048 --> 26:08.643
whole deep Pacific and Indian, Pacific and Indian 
oceans were filled up with a mixture

25:53.048 --> 26:08.643
predominantly of Antarctic bottom water. It was 
going on. So it was an overturn of something like

26:10.525 --> 26:11.867
once every thousand years. It's a little bit of a 
disaster on the basis of some some description of

26:14.654 --> 26:27.849
the cellocase, that there isn't any

26:14.654 --> 26:27.849
. Well, one

26:27.869 --> 26:42.366
can conjure up arguments

26:27.869 --> 26:42.366
to try to demolish his thesis. One can point out 
that he ignores features of numerical models that

26:43.730 --> 26:49.197
have already been made. In fact, he's taken a very 
simple model of a steady-state geostrophic

26:49.217 --> 26:55.505
infection. He's ignoring lateral mixing and all 
kinds of things like that. Well, the way I feel

27:00.592 --> 27:13.028
about this is that probably he's, by looking 
around in the clever way he does at the

27:00.592 --> 27:13.028
information, He's recognized some color to a few 
pieces of the puzzle that other people haven't

27:13.514 --> 27:23.347
seen. But that he's overlooking certain things 
like the shapes of the jigsaw puzzle itself. And so

27:31.938 --> 27:39.268
we haven't seen those, we haven't seen the colors 
of those things, which we do need as hints. But at

27:40.058 --> 27:51.209
the same time,

27:40.058 --> 27:51.209
he's probably isolated some major constraint on 
the system, which is not quite as strong a

27:40.058 --> 27:51.209
constraint as he thinks it is. And because we don't 
have ways of putting together in a systematic way

27:51.750 --> 28:05.003
other constraints like that over the whole ocean,

27:51.750 --> 28:05.003
we can't really There's not so much to contend 
about, basically.

28:17.870 --> 28:35.766
And someday, these important facts aren't going 
to be introduced one at a time, like

28:17.870 --> 28:35.766
dissociated from everything else that's ever 
been introduced. All of these things, all of these

28:38.058 --> 28:51.644
ideas will come in in some balanced way to give an 
optimum picture of what the circulation is. I

28:51.664 --> 28:56.734
don't know exactly how

28:51.664 --> 28:56.734
it's going to be done. But I do know how to take his 
paper and to relate it to some numerical models of

29:02.442 --> 29:17.139
the abyssal circulation, which make his case for 
zero energetic bottom-up formation very much

29:02.442 --> 29:17.139
weaker. I don't want to abandon the important 
things that he discovers, but I think that the

29:17.159 --> 29:30.053
conceptual framework in which the argument is 
made is too narrow, too special, and therefore

29:30.809 --> 29:38.479
those important facts don't quite mean what he 
thinks they mean. And they ought to be related to a

29:38.499 --> 29:54.181
lot of other important facts all around the place, 
not just selective, like a lawyer makes a case for

29:38.499 --> 29:54.181
some particular thing, but use all the good 
evidence

29:38.499 --> 29:54.181
in some kind of way and see what it tells you. And as 
long as we don't have some kind of way of

29:54.201 --> 29:59.668
manipulating it, weighing, relating large 
amounts of different kinds of qualitative

30:00.172 --> 30:17.890
evidence, then the temptation to be a lawyer, just 
pick and choose those aspects of the thing which

30:00.172 --> 30:17.890
will defend a particular case, that temptation is 
always going to be there. And so we don't want to be a

30:17.910 --> 30:22.895
bunch of lawyers arguing special cases. We want 
some mechanism for a measured judgment. which we

30:29.197 --> 30:34.952
can all agree what its elements are. I think some 
numerical methods are going to be worked out. I

30:40.686 --> 30:42.210
think that's going to be an exciting thing.
