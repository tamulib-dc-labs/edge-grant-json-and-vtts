WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:11.457
Well, the next thing I think he got wrong was he 
argued too much about the mechanism. Now, we know

00:11.898 --> 00:24.071
very little about the inside of the Earth, and I 
think one should separate fairly clearly

00:11.898 --> 00:24.071
arguments about matters that are fairly direct 
consequences of observation. If you're going to

00:24.631 --> 00:29.076
argue that continents have split and moved apart, 
you would best argue it, on the evidence for it

00:30.102 --> 00:38.754
having happened, not on arguments to show that it 
must happen from models of the Earth. I mean, it is

00:38.974 --> 00:49.709
not a strong argument to say that we know so much 
about the inside of the Earth that such and such

00:38.974 --> 00:49.709
things will happen and the Earth will be split 
apart, because you know so little about it. You do

00:49.809 --> 00:54.135
better to separate very clearly the evidence for 
the thing having happened from the evidence of the

00:54.487 --> 00:58.773
reasons why it happens. You can see this in an ice 
age. For a hundred years we've known there have

01:00.996 --> 01:05.943
been ice ages and the evidence for this is seen in 
the mountains. The evidence for glacial periods

01:07.425 --> 01:11.130
in Europe and North America is overwhelming. But 
we still don't know why they happen. You can

01:13.814 --> 01:24.308
perfectly well have accepted facts and a view of a 
historical process without knowing the driving

01:24.355 --> 01:25.858
mechanism. And if you start arguing too early 
about the driving mechanism, you'll get into a

01:25.878 --> 01:33.430
morass of controversy with theoretical 
physicists. Another nice example of this is the

01:34.211 --> 01:42.605
example of cigarette smoking and cancer, which 
was an observed fact before there was a theory of

01:34.211 --> 01:42.605
it. There isn't much of a theory now. And another 
one is cholera. that cholera was discovered to be

01:49.313 --> 02:13.498
waterborne before it was known to be due to 
bacteria and so that I think Wegener made

01:49.313 --> 02:13.498
fundamental misjudgments about how to conduct a 
scientific argument and the literature of the 20s

01:49.313 --> 02:13.498
is extremely interesting I've written a paper on 
this so I won't say any more about it there's a paper

01:49.313 --> 02:13.498
in last year's advances in geophysics in which I 
I've collected a lot of quotations in the

02:14.221 --> 02:20.308
literature of the period. Things like, there's a 
man who says, the idea of continental drift is a

02:22.710 --> 02:39.248
beautiful vision and we try and clasp it in our arms 
and embrace it and it dissolves and we are left with

02:22.710 --> 02:39.248
nothing. He was, of course, a Frenchman. Well, 
anyway, Wagner, by and large, lost the argument in

02:44.832 --> 02:51.401
North America and in England. He did not lose it in 
the southern hemisphere. In South Africa, the

02:55.807 --> 02:59.733
evidence is very much clearer. The reason being 
that on the whole, the geological structures in

02:59.753 --> 03:11.710
South America and in South Africa run across the 
coast. I mean, for example, the the Fold Mountains

03:14.431 --> 03:17.235
of Cape Province. They run parallel to the south 
coast, but they run across and out to sea around

03:18.017 --> 03:28.594
Cape Town, and are picked up again on the other side 
in, I think it's Ecuador. I never know which South

03:28.614 --> 03:30.877
American republic is which. And very, sorry, 
Dutoit, the South African geologist, Alexander

03:32.299 --> 03:41.434
Dutoit, went to South America. and wrote a 
beautiful passage in which he said he found it hard

03:42.308 --> 03:50.579
to believe he was not in some rarely visited part of 
the Cape Province. The complete succession of the

03:50.919 --> 03:56.126
rocks, the point at which the ice ages occurred, 
everything repeated. And it was much more obvious

03:56.807 --> 04:11.607
in South Africa and South America than it was in 
North America where the structures, the

03:56.807 --> 04:11.607
Appalachian Mountains, run parallel to the coast 
and then up into Greenland.

04:13.797 --> 04:23.050
So that Wegener lost the argument before the war, 
and the argument died during the 30s for lack of new

04:13.797 --> 04:23.050
things to say about it. And when I came into these 
things, geological feeling was very strong in

04:23.070 --> 04:35.547
favor of the permanence of the oceans and the 
stability of the continents. And after the war,

04:36.348 --> 04:42.336
there were various converging things which made 
caused the revolution of thought. The first, I

04:46.861 --> 04:51.225
think, was the study of paleomagnetism. 
Paleomagnetism is the study of fossil compasses.

04:56.730 --> 05:13.707
This showed, at first it looked rather probable, 
gradually became more and more likely that the

04:56.730 --> 05:13.707
continents had moved relative to each other 
because the compasses buried in the rocks did not

04:56.730 --> 05:13.707
all point to a single pole. And I was personally 
convinced, I was more or less convinced early on by

05:14.497 --> 05:21.105
Keith Runkall of Newcastle. Runkall and Blackett 
were the great new originators of this. Work had

05:26.512 --> 05:31.918
been done by the French at the beginning of the 
century, and no one paid the slightest attention

05:26.512 --> 05:31.918
to it. Largely, I think, because it was written in 
French. Very curious that this very good French

05:34.501 --> 05:43.913
work of the early 1900s was completely ignored and 
then extracted later. All the references to this

05:44.163 --> 05:46.968
will be found in my paper. But Runcorn was also, I 
think, psychologically unwise. When he had a

05:55.862 --> 06:01.832
moderate case, he insisted that everyone must 
believe it. I remember him saying to me once,

06:01.973 --> 06:06.500
Teddy, you do agree, don't you? And I said, well, 
Keith, it looks like it. It looks it's all right.

06:10.673 --> 06:15.077
but I don't feel 100% certain, I don't feel it's 
conclusive. And he said, Teddy, those who are not

06:15.097 --> 06:19.901
with us are against us. Well, this kind of 
attitude, you see, stiffened people's

06:19.941 --> 06:24.846
objections, really. I'd have believed it, I 
think, a year before, if it hadn't been for the way

06:24.906 --> 06:31.872
Runcorn approached it. But then one of Runcorn's 
students, a man called Irving, who was also at

06:31.892 --> 06:40.360
Cambridge in the later part of this exercise, he 
was in Manchester with Blackhead at first,

06:41.133 --> 06:57.503
Incidentally, Rumcorn got the professorship in 
Newcastle, and actually I was to a great extent

06:41.133 --> 06:57.503
instrumental in getting him the professorship in 
Newcastle, mostly because I wanted his job in

06:41.133 --> 06:57.503
Cambridge. He's the man who had the bottom of the 
heap job, which I took in Cambridge. There are

07:02.918 --> 07:12.528
various funny stories connected with this 
exercise, the effort to get Runcorn, who was then

07:02.918 --> 07:12.528
very young, put into a, made head of the physics 
department in Newcastle. Well, anyway, Runcorn,

07:12.548 --> 07:18.975
very bright, good man indeed, but not the most 
tactful man in the world. Well, then, the first

07:19.415 --> 07:25.762
thing then that looked really conclusive was the 
paleomagnetism. At the same time, the study of the

07:26.282 --> 07:32.689
oceans was going on, and the first thing that 
looked odd was that the sediments were so thin. If

07:36.855 --> 07:44.001
the oceans had always been there, one would expect 
kilometers of sediment, but 100 meters was quite

07:36.855 --> 07:44.001
rare. Sediments, really very thin sediments, 
particularly in the middle of the oceans,

07:44.902 --> 07:52.629
sediments thickening as you went out. Then it was 
gradually borne in on us that the sediments were

07:52.849 --> 07:59.835
all fairly recent. In the last 10% or so less than 
that, the last five or ten percent of geological

08:02.622 --> 08:08.068
time. A very striking observation, but at first of 
course not so striking because one found the

08:08.108 --> 08:22.162
sediments were young and one said, well of course 
they're young, they've just been put down on the

08:08.108 --> 08:22.162
bottom, we're looking at the surface of the 
superficial layer. But then we started to get

08:22.743 --> 08:27.988
sediments going back a couple of hundred million 
years. which is only a small portion of the history

08:28.508 --> 08:31.151
of the Earth. But there were plenty of sediments 
back a couple of hundred million years, and then

08:31.271 --> 08:37.757
nothing. So there was this very surprising result 
that we had sediments, not only recent sediments,

08:37.777 --> 08:48.748
but sediments up to a certain age, and then 
nothing. And of course, this was quite mysterious

08:48.768 --> 08:51.590
and was only a thing. No one discovered it. It just 
gradually appeared as we collected data. The man

08:58.968 --> 09:04.693
who made the great jump, I think, was Harry Hess, in 
a way. Harry Hess, who was also brought into this

09:04.813 --> 09:22.449
subject by Dick Field, was interested in the 
mid-ocean ridges, and via a process which has

09:04.813 --> 09:22.449
never been entirely clear to me, said that he 
thought that new ocean crust was being formed

09:04.813 --> 09:22.449
there. Various people had said it before. I had 
said this. I was surprised to find the other day

09:27.740 --> 09:31.664
that I had said this just after the war, I think. But 
without the idea that there was sea floor

09:31.684 --> 09:42.556
spreading, that this involved, I said crust is 
being formed, and I hadn't realised quite that

09:31.684 --> 09:42.556
this involved moving the other out of the way. But 
he said the idea of sea floor spreading, that new

09:42.956 --> 09:51.185
crust was being formed on the axis, and the old 
crust was moving away. And then it was not a great

09:51.245 --> 09:57.392
jump to say, well, there are no earthquakes on the 
junction of the Atlantic and Europe, or the

09:57.929 --> 10:05.638
Atlantic and North America, the Atlantic and 
South America, the Atlantic and Africa, and

09:57.929 --> 10:05.638
therefore nothing's happening there. The 
continents are moving with the oceanic crust. But

10:10.663 --> 10:15.849
this was not very clear, not very obvious. It was an 
idea of Hesse's. I didn't take it all that

10:20.534 --> 10:22.376
seriously. It was produced, I think, somewhere 
about 1960. And then This party we had in the Indian

10:27.950 --> 10:38.405
Ocean, the penny drop fall, we'd been doing 
magnetic survey at sea for some years. And we had

10:38.425 --> 10:49.200
found ups and downs in the intensity of the 
magnetic field, which were clearly connected

10:38.425 --> 10:49.200
with, in some way, with the magnetization of the 
sea floor. But we didn't understand it. I made

10:52.104 --> 10:57.872
something of an ass to myself by writing a review of 
the subject without seeing the point. Very

10:58.460 --> 11:02.746
interesting to look back at it now, somewhere 
about 1960. I wrote an article, it was published a

11:02.926 --> 11:08.174
year or more later, in which I didn't see the point. 
And then, Matthews and Vine, who were in a naval

11:08.855 --> 11:19.310
ship in the Indian Ocean, doing a detailed survey 
of a square degree in the Indian Ocean. I'd always

11:19.350 --> 11:21.092
had a desire to do a detailed survey of a small piece 
of the mid-ocean ridge. I made the suggestion

11:25.556 --> 11:33.687
before the war, and war came too soon, and 
eventually in 1962, I think it was, we did this

11:25.556 --> 11:33.687
square debris. I wasn't there, it was done by 
Matthews and Vine in a naval survey ship, and they

11:33.767 --> 11:48.447
were able, as well as doing the topography, to do 
the magnetic field, and they did a very detailed

11:33.767 --> 11:48.447
survey, and they saw that certain of the mountains 
on the bottom of the sea were magnetised the wrong

11:48.916 --> 11:53.803
way round. Well, and then the penny dropped and 
they said all these ups and downs, wiggles of the

11:54.665 --> 12:07.784
magnetic field on the bottom of the sea are a 
record, a tape recording of the reversals of the

11:54.665 --> 12:07.784
Earth's magnetic field. They're recorded on the 
axis of the ridge as the lavas cool and then they're

12:07.824 --> 12:16.577
carried away by, the tape moves away and a double 
recording is made I'm not going to explain this in

12:16.709 --> 12:18.472
detail. Myself and everyone else have written 
numerous papers about it. But this was the, in

12:23.799 --> 12:28.606
practice, the conclusive thing. But it's 
interesting, only two years before, I had been

12:29.607 --> 12:38.300
asked to give a talk to the Geological Society of 
London. I was rung up by the president, Ullman. And

12:41.564 --> 12:45.450
he said, look, we've got a set of Bolsheviks in this 
society. who think that the meetings ought to be

12:45.751 --> 12:49.577
interesting. And they say our meetings are too 
dull and too detailed and we ought to have some

12:49.597 --> 12:53.903
review lectures. And he said, would you give a 
review lecture? We feel we can't oppose this. We

12:58.069 --> 13:01.655
must, the council feels that it must give in to some 
extent. And would you give a lecture? I said,

13:03.477 --> 13:04.539
please do. And he said, what will you talk about? 
And I said, I will talk about continental drift.

13:10.007 --> 13:12.110
And he said, oh, will you? And I said, yes, I'd like 
to. And he said, well, of course, there's never

13:15.468 --> 13:17.851
many people come to the June meeting. Perhaps we 
could have it there. So I said, all right, that'd be

13:20.154 --> 13:23.037
nice. And so I came along to the June meeting and I 
went in to tea. There seemed to me to be a fair number

13:28.344 --> 13:30.567
of people in tea. And the Genealogical Society is 
an old-fashioned body and it's customary for the

13:31.608 --> 13:42.882
fellows to go in, the audience to go in and sit down 
and wait a moment. And then the the president and

13:44.645 --> 13:49.672
the secretaries and the treasurer walk in, a sort 
of concession. This time they couldn't get in

13:50.352 --> 13:56.781
because all the aisles were blocked by people 
sitting in them. We had the biggest audience who

13:56.801 --> 14:06.253
could possibly get into the room, people poking 
their heads through the doors, and the president

13:56.801 --> 14:06.253
and the secretaries had to come in through the 
window from the courtyard outside. Well, this I

14:07.174 --> 14:13.723
took as a sign that it was an idea whose time had 
come, And I gave a talk not using the ideas that Vine

14:14.767 --> 14:23.377
and Matthews were having. I think they hadn't 
quite been produced at the time I gave the talk. And

14:28.123 --> 14:32.708
when I wrote it up, I thought it would be unfair to 
them to steal their thunder. So the paper, both as

14:32.748 --> 14:44.402
given and as published, arrives at what's clearly 
now the correct conclusion about the motion of the

14:32.748 --> 14:44.402
continents and the youth of the sea floor. from the 
other arguments of paleomagnetism and various

14:44.753 --> 14:48.979
other things. And I think this had a certain 
influence, and the interesting thing was that a

14:49.740 --> 14:59.675
number of eminent geologists got up and said 
they'd already always believed it. But what had

15:00.516 --> 15:06.165
stopped them saying so was that Harold Jeffries 
said that it was impossible. Well, this again is

15:06.786 --> 15:11.132
the point, you see, that humans believe things on 
their own evidence. and not because some

15:11.433 --> 15:15.417
mathematician tells you they can't work. And one 
man, Edward Battisfee Bailey, who was director of

15:16.117 --> 15:31.951
the Geological Survey some years ago, a very old 
friend of mine, got up and said, in fact, he had

15:16.117 --> 15:31.951
given a lecture on the subject in, I think it was 
1910, in the Old Vic Theatre to some audience. How

15:31.971 --> 15:35.635
he could have come to give a lecture in a theatre on 
continental drift, I don't know. But he'd never

15:35.695 --> 15:39.859
written it up, and as far as I can make out, he'd 
never mentioned the question again. Very curious

15:40.299 --> 15:41.440
thing. And I think Jeffries really had a 
considerable influence, and also the fanatical

15:42.550 --> 15:51.859
opposition of eminent geologists in this 
country. The things they said about continental

15:52.780 --> 15:58.066
drift and about , you wouldn't believe. Someone or 
other, I forgot who it was now, said that he thought

16:00.388 --> 16:08.837
there should be a rule in all geological societies 
that this matter should not be mentioned again.

16:08.897 --> 16:12.000
This was in 1929. I give all the quotations and 
references to this in my paper.

16:19.625 --> 16:32.039
Now,

16:19.625 --> 16:32.039
current biography in 1954, as long as we're 
talking about the spirit, states that you had an

16:19.625 --> 16:32.039
interest in the utilization of solar energy from 
eucalyptus trees. Oh, I know what that is. I was

16:34.982 --> 16:40.148
interested in solar energy, and I

16:43.013 --> 16:53.565
I think I became interested in it during the first 
Labour government, not the first Labour

16:43.013 --> 16:53.565
government, the Labour government just after the 
war, when I was first director of the National

16:43.013 --> 16:53.565
Physical Lab. They believed that the wicked 
capitalists had prevented the British public

16:54.126 --> 17:04.198
from getting the advantages of science for their 
own nefarious reasons. And one of the things that

17:05.019 --> 17:10.185
was raised was that nothing was being done about 
solar energy. And that this was a wicked plot by the

17:11.161 --> 17:14.244
capitalists. Well, I was asked about this, and I 
said I didn't believe it. But they said, well,

17:17.426 --> 17:20.789
look, would you set up a committee to inquire into 
this? So I set up a committee, Patrick Blackett,

17:20.990 --> 17:26.454
myself, Will Hawthorne, Barry Sullivan, about 
half a dozen of us. And I was chairman, and I wrote

17:27.395 --> 17:33.901
the report, and I think really did most of the work. 
I've always regarded the report as one of my

17:33.921 --> 17:40.847
publications, but in fact, it is a production of 
the committee. And this is really a child's guide

17:41.857 --> 17:47.001
to the subject, it doesn't? It's quite short, and 
it considers in a rough way all the possibilities.

17:55.229 --> 18:09.841
And in this, one of the possibilities that's 
considered is that you might have a continually

17:55.229 --> 18:09.841
regenerating forest in which you burnt wood and 
replanted the forest and kept going on a given bit

17:55.229 --> 18:09.841
of land. And we show, this is clearly impractical, 
for a pastation of any useful size. But everyone

18:16.688 --> 18:18.831
quotes this for some reason. Well, this thing was 
published at the time and the reference is in my

18:18.851 --> 18:24.096
bibliography. So that was my first interest, 
really, in the matter, that I was chairman of this

18:24.677 --> 18:29.743
committee that looked into it. The report is 
fairly adverse to the uses of solar energy for the

18:30.183 --> 18:37.311
reasons that have become very apparent since

18:40.784 --> 18:44.147
for what you get out of it. I mean, at the time when 
oil was cheap, it was clearly just not on, except

18:44.368 --> 18:50.995
for specialized requirements. I mean, if you live 
in a desert miles from anywhere, it may well pay you

18:51.075 --> 18:57.361
to have solar energy to work your pumps in some way. 
But in general terms, it just wasn't on.

19:01.646 --> 19:09.694
Naturally, the increase in the price of oil has 
improved things somewhat, but unfortunately,

19:01.646 --> 19:09.694
Capital Plant has gone up by about as much as oil 
has. the increase in price of capital plant

19:10.012 --> 19:13.996
exceeds the general inflation. So it's not really 
very promising today, except for things like

19:14.016 --> 19:20.143
heating swimming pools, who just about break 
even. The interest on the capital required to warm

19:20.163 --> 19:28.251
a swimming pool is just about compensates for the 
cost of the gas you would burn. But of course there

19:28.892 --> 19:34.658
is the risk that they stop you burning gas and 
heating swimming pools, so then it might be

19:28.892 --> 19:34.658
attractive. Well, the next thing that happened 
about that was that I had a phone call In those days,

19:39.070 --> 19:42.334
about 1954, I suppose. And in those days, there was 
only radio communication across the Atlantic.

19:49.783 --> 19:51.565
And I couldn't hear what was being said. The only 
thing I could hear was that the man on the other end

19:52.065 --> 19:59.134
was asking me whether I would deputize for the 
chairman of General Motors, who was sick. And I

19:59.895 --> 20:04.720
thought to myself, this is the only time I'm ever 
going to deputize for the chairman of General

19:59.895 --> 20:04.720
Motors. So I said, I can't hear what you say. But the 
answer is yes, write and tell me what it is you want

20:07.488 --> 20:10.592
me to do. And it turned out they wanted me to make a 
keynote address to a conference on solar energy in

20:11.313 --> 20:20.044
Tucson, Arizona. So I went over there, and I was in a 
bit of a jam, because I was, after all, the chairman

20:20.825 --> 20:26.813
of this committee that produced an adverse 
report. And this meeting was clearly full of solar

20:27.293 --> 20:31.639
energy buffs. And so I didn't know quite what to do, 
because I didn't want to be rude to the audience or

20:31.659 --> 20:36.465
to the people who'd asked me. So I got up and I said 
what I thought about solar energy, a slightly

20:37.904 --> 20:46.894
softened version of what I'd said before. I mean, 
partly about the difficulties and the amount of

20:46.994 --> 20:50.598
work that needed to be done and so on. And then I said 
how good it was to be in America and how much I'd got

20:51.259 --> 21:01.350
from my visits to America and how much I 
appreciated it all, which no one ever does say.

21:01.370 --> 21:03.853
People in Europe think they're invited to America 
because it's their right to be invited. It never

21:06.435 --> 21:09.139
occurs to anyone, really, to say thank you. And 
this was a tremendous success. I was asked out that

21:11.903 --> 21:18.933
night by Luke Douglas, who was an ambassador in 
London, or had been shortly before. He was a

21:18.953 --> 21:22.138
one-eyed banker, became a great friend of mine 
afterwards. I've met him, he's dead now, I've met

21:22.158 --> 21:24.321
him many, many times. And the mayor of Tucson and 
the governor of Arizona, I forget who was governor

21:25.102 --> 21:32.693
of Arizona there, it was Gold... Goldberg's, 
what's his name? Goldwater? Goldwater's

21:35.285 --> 21:36.947
predecessor. Well anyway, they took me out for 
what in England we call a pub call. We went from one

21:42.133 --> 21:47.560
bar to another and they taught me how to mix various 
drinks. I remember it was my first introduction to

21:47.600 --> 21:51.965
a vodka martini. And really most entertaining and 
a very curious exercise a bit for an ambassador, a

21:56.568 --> 22:03.138
governor, and a mayor to go around from one pub to 
another. Of course, they were greeted everywhere

22:03.239 --> 22:05.682
with enthusiasm. They all got freshly drunk. 
Well, anyway, I tried afterwards to feed the

22:08.186 --> 22:18.402
chairman of the Russian Academy of Sciences on 
vodka martinis, but he wouldn't drink them. He

22:18.422 --> 22:21.567
said, you can't mix up vodka like the Americans do. 
You've got to drink it and eat. Well, anyway,

22:24.682 --> 22:28.929
that's the sum total of my connection with solar 
energy. Now,

22:30.872 --> 22:39.145
is there any personal history of the Bullard 
Brewing Company your great-grandfather

22:30.872 --> 22:39.145
founded? Why were you directed for five years? 
Well, it was founded, as you say, by my

22:41.449 --> 22:50.824
great-grandfather, Richard Bullard, and that 
was taken on by my grandfather, who was quite a

22:41.449 --> 22:50.824
character. a member of parliament for Norwich 
until he was ejected for bribery. Bribery in those

22:57.117 --> 22:59.559
days was a relatively minor thing. You 
distributed half crowns to people in pubs to vote

22:59.640 --> 23:04.145
for you. I mean, about 20 cents or something of this 
sort. And he was caught on this. When he got back to

23:09.090 --> 23:19.002
Norwich after having been expelled, he was met at 
the station by a large crowd who took the horses out

23:09.090 --> 23:19.002
of his carriage and dragged him in triumph through 
the streets. He was very popular locally. And a

23:21.652 --> 23:23.333
very considerable character. Well, I'm not going 
to tell stories about him. I never knew him. He died

23:26.396 --> 23:27.617
before I was born. And then my father took over the 
brewery and various uncles. My father was the main

23:32.902 --> 23:36.105
man in running the brewery. And he, my father, 
thought I was, regarded me as totally

23:37.366 --> 23:44.912
impractical. And for many years was exceedingly 
worried lest I shouldn't be able to earn my living.

23:51.993 --> 23:58.540
when I was a boy at school that I should become 
qualified as a chartered accountant, and then go

23:51.993 --> 23:58.540
as an accountant into the brewery. And I remember 
him giving me some small sum of money, investing it

23:59.381 --> 24:05.047
for me. He produced an income of about £100 a year. 
And he said, at any rate, Edward, every day of your

24:08.590 --> 24:14.256
life, you'll be able to buy yourself lunch. Little 
did he know about inflation. And this was a very

24:17.238 --> 24:20.423
curious thing. There was really no reason to 
suppose I couldn't look after my son. If I had been,

24:23.107 --> 24:27.935
as a small child, as I said yesterday, I'd been 
disturbed when I was 10. But he never realized I'd

24:28.756 --> 24:30.799
grown up, I don't think. And so I never had any 
connection with the brewery as long as he was

24:31.541 --> 24:36.228
alive, really. I knew my way around it. I used to go 
down with him as a child. He was very kind to me.

24:40.735 --> 24:42.638
Every Saturday morning I used to go down and meet 
him at the brewery and we'd go around and make the

24:42.955 --> 24:51.708
measurements of the density of the beer or the 
hydromaton and look around and see that

24:42.955 --> 24:51.708
everything was clean and tidy. And then, when he 
died, we found the brewery in quite a mess in the

24:52.509 --> 25:03.866
sense that my father believed that money was bad 
for people. In particular, it was bad for the

25:03.886 --> 25:05.688
shareholders. And therefore he distributed the 
minimum possible amount in dividends And it

25:11.170 --> 25:13.353
stepped the money away. So there was a very large 
collection of cash. And the company was a public

25:17.438 --> 25:19.140
company. And you could buy the shares on the stock 
market. He'd been forced to make it a public

25:21.783 --> 25:29.392
company because he got into trouble with the 
taxation people who insisted on making it a public

25:21.783 --> 25:29.392
company. And if you'd bought the shares on the 
stock market and got control, you'd have found

25:30.113 --> 25:35.279
enough money to pay for them. And my cousin and I 
were very disturbed about this. My cousin asked me

25:38.403 --> 25:40.165
to become a director. And the rest of the directors 
were employees of the company. So in effect, what

25:43.079 --> 25:49.725
my cousin and I said went, because we could just 
have removed the other directors if necessary. So

25:49.745 --> 25:51.026
we ran this thing. My cousin ran it really, and I 
used to go pretty frequently. And we started

25:54.630 --> 25:57.732
buying other breweries with this money. We bought 
the breweries, and we closed them down, and kept

25:58.313 --> 26:02.857
their pubs. So we had more and more pubs. And this 
was going splendidly. We were all making our

26:07.481 --> 26:09.763
fortunes. Suddenly one day we found that Watkins, 
one of the big national brewers, were buying our

26:10.486 --> 26:15.531
shares. And we became rather disturbed about 
this, and eventually they came out into the open

26:16.792 --> 26:23.858
and said they wished to buy the thing. And the price 
they offered was so high that it was clear that a lot

26:23.878 --> 26:34.267
of the shares were held by trustees for old ladies 
in the older generation of the family. And the

26:34.287 --> 26:38.451
trustees would certainly have sold the shares at 
the price that was offered, which was ludicrous.

26:39.055 --> 26:50.348
And so we very regretfully accepted, I think, £9.2 
million for an enterprise that could have been

26:39.055 --> 26:50.348
bought for £1.5 million three or four years 
before. So we did extremely well out of it, but I

26:51.229 --> 26:54.492
very much regretted it. It's certainly been not in 
the public interest and not in our interest. We

26:58.817 --> 27:01.120
could have made more money by going on as we were. We 
had other views for gobbling up other breweries.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.866
And we were doing very well. And what's the public 
is? It's given them no choice between their beers.

27:10.998 --> 27:13.902
They have to drink Mr. Watney's beer now. And it 
didn't do the Watneys much good. Of course, Mr.

27:16.226 --> 27:21.253
Watney paid so much for the thing that they got into 
financial difficulties. And the next takeover

27:21.273 --> 27:24.478
they tried to do failed. And then they got caught 
themselves by a purely financial group. And this

27:29.705 --> 27:33.892
group paid so much for Watneys that they're now in 
financial difficulties. So everyone concerned

27:33.912 --> 27:36.315
is in financial difficulties. except the 
shareholders of the company of Bullards and the

27:36.751 --> 27:42.638
companies we took over. Of course, the people who 
were in the shares of some of the breweries we took

27:43.098 --> 27:52.529
over have been taken over three times, once by us, 
once by Watney's, and once by these financiers.

27:52.549 --> 27:57.995
And they've gained factors varying between 2 and 
10 every time. So a very curious story. But that's

28:00.798 --> 28:04.142
how I became to be in the brewing business. I was a 
consultant to Watney's afterwards. It was all

28:08.295 --> 28:10.079
done quite amiably. And now I have a pension from 
Watney's. Not very much, but I do get a pension from

28:14.471 --> 28:19.043
Watney's.
