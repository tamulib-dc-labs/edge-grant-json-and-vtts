00:03.068 --> 00:09.238
I was picked up by a woman and about three of her kids, and she wanted me to drive.

00:10.100 --> 00:18.934
And I drove to Corsican, that's where she, so and then I got rides from then on.

00:20.652 --> 00:23.755
down here in different ways.

00:24.936 --> 00:37.347
I'll never forget going up there one summer to see this friend that was going to North Texas and I got an Ennis.

00:38.808 --> 00:39.909
I'll never forget that.

00:40.449 --> 00:45.274
The old boy stopped and picked me up and he said, let me go over here a little.

00:46.154 --> 00:49.157
And he went over there to see about a house and he went over

00:49.593 --> 00:57.003
gone about a couple of hours and he dropped me off and he said same place he picked me up to this as far as I go.

00:57.985 --> 01:01.149
He was a real estate man.

01:01.169 --> 01:04.714
Did you ever have any bad experiences hitchhiking?

01:04.734 --> 01:04.975
No.

01:06.437 --> 01:10.302
I've had some long time waits.

01:11.851 --> 01:15.156
But other than that, why?

01:15.496 --> 01:23.668
Where did, if you were going north, when you were a student here, where did you catch the ride from the campus?

01:23.989 --> 01:27.173
Where was the place to go to get a ride going north?

01:29.617 --> 01:38.550
Well, where the post office is up at the north gate now, that one, that post office wasn't there then.

01:39.728 --> 01:41.351
And we'd all stand out there.

01:41.552 --> 01:44.638
If you were a senior, you were the first one down the line.

01:45.340 --> 01:51.232
And then junior and sophomore and then freshman when you finally moved up.

01:51.794 --> 01:52.034
All right.

01:52.054 --> 01:55.281
Now later, rank didn't matter, but it did.

01:55.301 --> 01:56.984
After you got out on that highway.

01:57.145 --> 01:57.646
Oh, okay.

01:57.666 --> 01:59.049
Somewhere else, it didn't matter.

01:59.289 --> 01:59.610
Oh, okay.

02:00.940 --> 02:10.060
I have not yet interviewed anybody who has told me about any bad Aggie hitchhiking experience.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.247
As far as I know, I never ran into any of it.

02:18.418 --> 02:20.603
But I never did do a lot of hitchhiking.

02:22.945 --> 02:27.611
After my sophomore year, I never didn't get to go anywhere.

02:28.132 --> 02:31.616
All right, now you said you lost contact with your father.

02:31.757 --> 02:34.400
You had a sister back in Vernon.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.041
Uh-huh.

02:35.101 --> 02:37.244
So you didn't go home much.

02:37.264 --> 02:39.667
No, I didn't go anywhere.

02:40.128 --> 02:43.512
Where did you live between the semesters?

02:43.612 --> 02:44.834
Could you stay on the campus?

02:45.194 --> 02:49.560
They let us stay on the dormitories that were empty.

02:51.008 --> 02:56.418
And most of the time, it was either in the heart.

02:58.602 --> 03:12.308
Now that dormitory's not there anymore, but they had an old Ross Hall, and we stayed in that, and it had

03:13.165 --> 03:24.743
About the time we started going to supper over on the campus, why, this thing is full of bats.

03:28.048 --> 03:36.020
And they start coming out those windows.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.823
It had a long haul down there.

03:38.883 --> 03:49.003
rooms on each side of the hall, and had that big old, big windows on each end of that thing.

03:50.606 --> 03:53.652
And here they'd come out, Ross Hall.

03:56.638 --> 04:01.127
It was right across from the YMCA there.

04:01.360 --> 04:06.026
Now, did you work at the Aggieland Inn then between semesters?

04:06.386 --> 04:07.628
Yeah.

04:08.429 --> 04:10.031
We had to keep that job.

04:10.832 --> 04:12.173
I couldn't let that job go.

04:12.213 --> 04:13.515
We stayed there.

04:13.535 --> 04:14.376
And I went to school.

04:15.357 --> 04:17.280
I'd get 12 hours in the summertime.

04:17.981 --> 04:21.265
Describe the YMCA in those days.

04:21.505 --> 04:23.247
Well, I don't know much about the YMCA.

04:23.568 --> 04:25.690
Did you meet Mr. Remember Mr. Cashin?

04:26.171 --> 04:26.952
I knew him well.

04:27.032 --> 04:28.193
Describe him, please.

04:28.694 --> 04:29.595
He was...

04:32.090 --> 04:46.989
He was, as far as I know, he would come in there every once in a while and have coffee or something during, but I never did go in the YMCA to speak of.

04:48.211 --> 04:54.979
Had, they had a lot of things going on campus.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.565
That's where we had our Yale practice out there on the,

04:59.782 --> 05:01.388
on those steps.

05:01.489 --> 05:04.621
Describe your practice.

05:05.725 --> 05:06.147
Well,

05:08.928 --> 05:16.339
They had it every so often, every once, two or three nights a week, you know.

05:17.721 --> 05:23.590
But when they were having them, I was generally still working.

05:23.610 --> 05:33.446
So we closed up at 7.30 or somebody was there, we had to stay till they left, you know, while we were eating.

05:33.466 --> 05:37.011
Did you by chance meet those two little boys in the Cashin family?

05:37.885 --> 05:38.906
Did you know those?

05:39.247 --> 05:45.857
They were, I believe, right across the street from the old hospital.

05:46.317 --> 05:48.120
That was where they were born, I believe.

05:48.761 --> 05:53.067
If I'm not mistaken, that's where they were born.

05:53.107 --> 05:55.771
Did you by chance see them as they were little kids?

05:56.552 --> 05:57.474
Oh, I guess I did.

05:57.494 --> 05:59.016
I didn't pay much attention to them.

05:59.384 --> 06:04.232
I've interviewed them, and apparently they thought it was fun to be little kids on the campus.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.353
Well, I guess so.

06:06.555 --> 06:08.198
Isn't that where they said they lived?

06:08.218 --> 06:13.767
If I'm not mistaken, I believe it was right across the street from the old hospital.

06:13.787 --> 06:17.533
Did you ever have to go to the hospital while you were a student?

06:17.653 --> 06:18.354
What was it like?

06:21.599 --> 06:23.362
Well, not much.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.143
Not much.

06:27.734 --> 06:31.237
And it'd go over, you know, you'd feel like you had the flu or something.

06:31.257 --> 06:34.500
They'd give you some medicine and let you go on about your business.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.323
Now, did it have some overnight rooms?

06:37.503 --> 06:42.888
Could a... Yes, people were... Dr. Marsh, I can remember him being there.

06:43.729 --> 06:48.033
And he operated, they had operations and things right there in that hospital.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.815
Describe Dr. Marsh.

06:51.035 --> 06:51.876
Well, I didn't know him.

06:51.896 --> 06:52.336
Oh, you didn't?

06:52.517 --> 06:55.159
I never knew much about him.

06:56.067 --> 06:59.710
And until I got into the sporting goods business.

07:01.151 --> 07:04.014
And I bought two or three different boats for him.

07:04.034 --> 07:09.659
And he loved to go down on the coast and fish down on the coast.

07:10.199 --> 07:15.564
Guyon Hall was the place for movies and other big events.

07:16.024 --> 07:16.785
That's right.

07:17.525 --> 07:17.786
Describe.

07:17.806 --> 07:19.847
Took a lot of examinations over there.

07:20.848 --> 07:25.112
Now that lady out there, when she graduated,

07:25.548 --> 07:29.152
from TSCW or whenever it was when she graduated.

07:29.713 --> 07:32.196
She played the organ over there every Sunday morning.

07:34.379 --> 07:38.985
And for religious services, for chapel?

07:39.365 --> 07:45.072
Well, I'm sure that they, before I got here, they had a bunch of men, I understand.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.936
Did you go to movies at Guyon Hall?

07:47.956 --> 07:50.779
No, most of the movies I went to

07:51.215 --> 07:59.123
was on the old campus there where the All Faith Chapel is now.

08:00.664 --> 08:02.786
There's an old wooden building.

08:03.867 --> 08:11.494
And that's where they had, especially Saturday.

08:11.514 --> 08:15.959
Now what would you guys do during a movie in that old?

08:15.979 --> 08:17.340
Oh, in that old one.

08:17.877 --> 08:27.627
And you couldn't, they'd buy these peanuts and one of them would get upstairs and throw peanuts down.

08:30.370 --> 08:33.133
And something went on, you know, loving and something.

08:33.153 --> 08:35.315
They'd make all kinds of noises.

08:38.538 --> 08:39.800
It was interesting.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.061
Let's see.

08:41.902 --> 08:46.787
During your days as a student, were there easy courses for the athletes?

08:48.337 --> 08:50.981
Did athletes get special treatment as far as you knew?

08:51.041 --> 09:05.863
The only one I know is, I knew all those athletes, and there wasn't an athlete hardly that I didn't know.

09:07.005 --> 09:16.960
And we had Dick Todd and I, and Marion Pugh, Doug Dawson,

09:17.935 --> 09:29.570
And oh, I don't know, half a dozen or more had a course in training under old, well, I can't think of his name right offhand, but.

09:29.971 --> 09:30.812
Athletic training?

09:31.132 --> 09:32.894
Athletic training.

09:32.914 --> 09:46.592
And he went in, we went in the swimming pool there one day, and he says, now all y'all want to get in there, make out like you're drowning.

09:46.893 --> 09:53.459
But nobody wanted to go in and get wet and take off her clothes and put them on and get.

09:54.921 --> 10:04.490
So, Lil, Lil Dimit, I believe, I believe that was his name, who was one of the trainers, Lil Dimit.

10:06.051 --> 10:12.757
And everybody had to make an A. He said, I can't give everybody A's.

10:12.777 --> 10:14.419
But most of them got A's.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.262
That's the only thing.

10:19.282 --> 10:29.815
I took some courses under Ken Berthy in the summertime.

10:30.275 --> 10:31.196
Now, what did he teach?

10:31.837 --> 10:34.320
He taught… P.E.?

10:34.340 --> 10:34.841
P.E.

10:36.122 --> 10:36.723
Good teacher.

10:37.264 --> 10:39.686
What did he do that made him a good teacher?

10:39.767 --> 10:45.233
I've heard… Well, he was just one of you, really.

10:45.753 --> 10:47.837
That's the only way I could explain.

10:51.084 --> 10:55.393
Were there religious activities on the campus during your student days?

10:57.598 --> 10:59.041
Were there chapel services?

11:00.183 --> 11:01.205
Oh, I'm sure there were.

11:01.266 --> 11:03.390
But...

11:05.362 --> 11:17.937
Most of those things, they weren't for me because I was always working until 7.30, from 5.30 to 7.30.

11:18.517 --> 11:24.685
Did you go to church on Sundays as a student?

11:25.365 --> 11:35.217
If they had services earlier, like 10 o'clock, had two services, sometimes I could go at 10 o'clock because at 11.30 I had to be at work.

11:36.412 --> 11:37.934
That messed up a lot of things.

11:39.596 --> 11:42.020
I had to have that job.

11:42.981 --> 11:48.468
Describe going to a basketball game in DeWare Fieldhouse.

11:50.892 --> 12:06.132
You know, when John Floyd got here, they had a real good program there for a while.

12:07.327 --> 12:15.258
And, in fact, I went, that was after I graduated, though.

12:15.278 --> 12:20.084
But some of those others, I didn't go much.

12:20.124 --> 12:27.174
Because they were, most of the time, they were always at 7 o'clock.

12:27.254 --> 12:37.047
And I just... Did the other guys try to pick on you because your job could get you out of some of the...

12:37.550 --> 12:40.353
I don't know if it did.

12:41.755 --> 12:42.475
It sure did.

12:42.495 --> 12:52.066
I was just telling up there two or three weeks ago was in there eating at the cafeteria.

12:53.187 --> 13:05.481
And I said, I don't know of any boy that ever didn't have any family that went to A&M any cheaper than I did.

13:07.975 --> 13:10.880
And I still don't know how in the world I did it.

13:13.024 --> 13:15.809
I must have done something fairly well.

13:16.411 --> 13:20.017
Now, did you get any letters from your sister very often?

13:21.360 --> 13:22.642
No, no.

13:22.882 --> 13:27.030
The youngest one next to me, she would write me every once in a while.

13:27.050 --> 13:29.715
And did you write letters to anybody in the family?

13:30.056 --> 13:30.777
No, no, I didn't.

13:31.685 --> 13:37.592
They, my senior year, my sister got married.

13:37.632 --> 13:48.464
It must have been in the spring and she brought my dad down here one day and they ate lunch in there in the cafeteria.

13:48.484 --> 13:49.805
That was your senior year?

13:49.825 --> 13:50.666
My senior year.

13:51.767 --> 13:54.250
And that's the only time they ever, I ever saw them.

13:54.989 --> 14:03.341
Now, when you were an undergraduate, what were the most respected student organizations?

14:03.782 --> 14:05.344
Well, now, I didn't get into it.

14:05.424 --> 14:12.094
No, but what did you and your buddies think about the singing cadets or the band or the Ross Volunteers?

14:12.815 --> 14:18.524
Well, I admired the Ross Volunteers because they were pretty well.

14:19.665 --> 14:24.152
In fact, I thought they were the cream of the crop of them.

14:24.959 --> 14:30.746
of the organizations, but I never did because I didn't have any money.

14:31.147 --> 14:32.028
What about the band?

14:32.669 --> 14:52.493
Oh, I thought the band, and I still believe that the most organized and the most, well, I don't know what a good word you could call it, but they were more together than any organization on this campus.

14:53.154 --> 14:54.696
Who was the director of the band then?

14:55.486 --> 14:56.428
was Colonel Dunn.

14:57.770 --> 14:58.431
What was he like?

15:00.374 --> 15:02.558
Well, I didn't know him very well.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.801
She knew him.

15:04.821 --> 15:09.750
She could tell you a lot of things.

15:10.912 --> 15:15.299
Colonel Dunn had a daughter, and they were real, real close.

15:15.359 --> 15:17.763
She went to school with Alley.

15:18.444 --> 15:20.167
What about Colonel Andy?

15:20.187 --> 15:21.409
Did you ever know him?

15:22.823 --> 15:28.772
Yeah, I just knew him as a coach.

15:28.872 --> 15:30.134
I didn't get back to her.

15:30.494 --> 15:30.815
Okay.

15:31.937 --> 15:34.981
He came from Mississippi State where her father came from.

15:35.001 --> 15:35.382
Okay.

15:36.143 --> 15:39.988
What about, were you aware that there were some secret fraternities?

15:40.169 --> 15:40.629
Yes, sir.

15:44.215 --> 15:45.777
John Bone isn't one of them.

15:47.292 --> 15:49.915
Chick Sale was one of them.

15:49.935 --> 15:51.596
But I didn't know anything about it.

15:51.616 --> 15:53.138
What was the name of them?

15:53.158 --> 15:53.638
Do you know?

15:53.658 --> 15:54.900
I really don't.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.964
Because I've heard that there were the TTs, the True Texans.

16:00.025 --> 16:03.428
Now you know more about that than maybe I do.

16:05.771 --> 16:06.852
Let's see, a yell leader.

16:06.872 --> 16:08.834
Was it a big deal to be a yell leader then?

16:12.658 --> 16:14.059
Oh, I'm sure it was.

16:15.710 --> 16:24.123
Because they had votes just like these things on the campuses over there now.

16:24.163 --> 16:29.631
What was the top position for a student on the campus?

16:31.454 --> 16:38.145
At that time, I guess the head of the cadet corps, I guess.

16:38.165 --> 16:38.806
Corps commander?

16:39.226 --> 16:42.291
Corps commander, I guess.

16:46.017 --> 16:46.678
Now, let's see.

16:46.718 --> 16:51.603
The president during your years was Dr. Walton.

16:52.564 --> 16:54.286
And did you all see much of him?

16:54.306 --> 17:03.336
No, but he was on the top floor down there in the system building.

17:05.258 --> 17:12.025
And, you know, at that time, nearly everybody lived on the campus.

17:13.169 --> 17:17.754
or had lived on the campus.

17:18.475 --> 17:24.821
And Dr. Walton and that little lady right out there family lives next door to each other, you know.

17:25.982 --> 17:27.965
And well, you can get a lot out of her.

17:29.446 --> 17:38.856
She can tell you about all of those indentations and lower deals over there in front of the president's home now.

17:39.562 --> 17:51.103
They were made in World War I so they could learn and they were trenches.

17:53.046 --> 17:55.050
But I won't get into her.

17:56.432 --> 18:02.363
Let's see, and the Waltons lived in the old president's house across from Cebiza.

18:03.288 --> 18:06.071
Or right next door to Agilene, yeah.

18:06.091 --> 18:06.732
Right.

18:07.113 --> 18:10.978
At one time, all the time of them, that's when they lived.

18:11.178 --> 18:15.623
Did you students ever try to do any pranks on the president or the president's house?

18:15.924 --> 18:17.886
As far as I know.

18:17.906 --> 18:19.869
You didn't have a car while you were a student.

18:20.770 --> 18:22.832
No.

18:23.133 --> 18:24.494
Did any of your buddies have a car?

18:26.457 --> 18:31.523
One boy in the band from San Antonio had a car.

18:32.465 --> 18:37.110
And he had to have it off of the campus.

18:37.931 --> 18:41.395
Had to rent a garage off the campus.

18:41.415 --> 18:42.916
They couldn't have one on the campus.

18:45.479 --> 18:48.843
When you were a student, how did an Aggie get a date?

18:51.426 --> 18:52.947
Where did you have?

18:53.128 --> 19:00.936
Well, in the spring of the year, all of your different military organizations

19:01.996 --> 19:09.948
had a dance on Friday, and then, uh, and then, uh, the Corps could go Saturday night.

19:11.070 --> 19:22.628
It was either, uh, uh, engineer dance Friday night, or field artillery, or infantry, or one of them.

19:22.648 --> 19:27.936
I think there were seven different organizations.

19:30.751 --> 19:45.351
If I'll say the engineer had a dance on Friday night, they had to move out and let their girlfriends out of their room.

19:46.773 --> 19:49.937
And then they had to get a room with somebody.

19:49.957 --> 19:52.641
Now where did those girls come from usually?

19:53.617 --> 19:57.704
Most of them back there then was from Denton.

19:57.724 --> 19:58.385
From CIA?

19:59.367 --> 19:59.687
Mm-hmm.

19:59.948 --> 20:03.233
Did you ever have a blind date with a girl from up there?

20:03.253 --> 20:05.938
Never had but one blind date, and that's right out there.

20:06.278 --> 20:07.420
And describe that.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.083
How did you have that blind date?

20:09.564 --> 20:10.866
Well...

20:10.846 --> 20:26.449
A friend of mine that worked there at Aggieland Inn was going with a girl at, I'll say CIA, you know.

20:26.469 --> 20:30.595
And she and Allie were real close.

20:32.077 --> 20:35.662
I don't know whether they roomed together or next door.

20:35.682 --> 20:40.549
Anyway, they both graduated in 37.

20:43.550 --> 20:47.436
And Allie was working for her father.

20:48.036 --> 20:51.101
So she had already graduated when you met her?

20:51.421 --> 20:52.463
Uh-huh.

20:52.483 --> 20:54.005
She graduated in 37.

20:55.807 --> 21:03.739
And her mother and father had to go on some kind of an agricultural trip to California somewhere.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.182
And she wanted to come down to see Allie.

21:07.324 --> 21:13.152
And so she wrote and asked or called whatever it was, called, asked and she'd come down there.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.234
because she was going with this boy.

21:16.396 --> 21:21.102
And they had gone with each other a good while.

21:22.304 --> 21:28.312
So she came down here and Addie had the car.

21:29.674 --> 21:38.006
So she asked me if I would have a blind date with her.

21:38.026 --> 21:42.632
So I had just bought

21:43.456 --> 21:46.361
me a tailor-made pair of pants.

21:47.182 --> 21:56.637
An old boy that used to just go to the Southwest Conference games and sell these athletes uniforms and clothes.

21:56.797 --> 22:02.106
And I bought a pair of pants from him.

22:03.233 --> 22:14.432
I had this date, and I put those pants on, and I put on a bow tie, and walked down here and over there, and knocked on the door, and she came to me.

22:14.512 --> 22:20.342
She said, I started closing the door on you, the way you looked.

22:20.362 --> 22:25.090
But anyway, I came back.

22:28.057 --> 22:28.858
A long time.

22:29.259 --> 22:31.321
Where did y'all go on that first date?

22:31.842 --> 22:35.447
Went to a picture show in Navasota.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.569
Oh, all the way to Navasota.

22:37.589 --> 22:38.010
Yes, sir.

22:38.170 --> 22:38.771
Sure did.

22:40.974 --> 22:44.318
And then you started dating fairly often.

22:45.059 --> 22:45.620
Quite a bit.

22:46.621 --> 22:50.926
And where would you take a date here?

22:52.208 --> 22:53.710
Well, we went to the show.

22:54.938 --> 22:59.085
Most of the time, I think it was a dime or 15 cents, it wasn't much.

23:00.607 --> 23:01.568
And that's about it.

23:01.909 --> 23:07.117
If an Aggie wanted to take his date after the show for a good time.

23:07.618 --> 23:08.680
Well, there wasn't any.

23:10.062 --> 23:13.327
As far as I know, because I didn't have the money to do it.

23:13.607 --> 23:16.732
But was there a place where he could have gotten a soft drink?

23:20.758 --> 23:23.022
I don't know where there was anybody.

23:24.757 --> 23:26.963
So this is during your senior year?

23:26.983 --> 23:28.428
My senior year.

23:29.932 --> 23:39.981
My senior year, I believe she and I and

23:42.374 --> 23:52.944
George Birch and his girl, we went to see my sister in Cruel as she got married.

23:54.445 --> 24:01.591
And we, George lived in Wichita Falls and we dropped them off in Wichita.

24:01.611 --> 24:03.273
We were all in that little old coop.

24:05.875 --> 24:11.200
And we went to see my sister and her husband.

24:13.964 --> 24:20.532
That's the only time I ever— All right, now by the time you graduated, were you all getting serious?

24:22.374 --> 24:24.816
Well, we were pretty close.

24:25.978 --> 24:43.718
When I graduated, Firestone Tire and River Company had a deal with their company that they were hiring a hundred graduates a year.

24:44.457 --> 24:46.979
for first someone to work for them.

24:48.901 --> 25:02.134
And so they came here and interviewed, and they picked four from A&M, which was the most of any university over the United States.

25:03.276 --> 25:04.597
And I happened to be one of them.

25:06.138 --> 25:11.764
And so when I graduated, we

25:13.330 --> 25:18.960
went to, they sent me to Big Spring.

25:19.681 --> 25:32.284
We were in a training program and they sent me to Big Spring and that was in April of my mark, May.

25:33.732 --> 25:37.617
It must have been the first of June.

25:38.158 --> 25:46.490
I had to get a bus out to Big Spring, and I stayed there until October.

25:47.592 --> 26:02.052
And then I met the other two, boy by the name of Charlie Madding, which is in Corpus, and Oscar Long, which is this one I tell you, was my best man at my wedding.

26:03.179 --> 26:09.866
He had a little old Chevrolet Coupe and all three of us met in Dallas.

26:11.268 --> 26:15.733
And we rode up to Akron, Ohio and that thing.

26:17.154 --> 26:18.836
We were going to save lots of money.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.580
What was your, do you remember your starting pay with Firestone?

26:22.600 --> 26:24.042
$115 a month.

26:24.963 --> 26:26.104
Big money for that.

26:27.025 --> 26:29.608
It seemed like big money, didn't it?

26:31.445 --> 26:34.709
We didn't know any better, I guess, but that was what it was.

26:34.729 --> 26:46.644
$115 a month, and they paid us what they thought it was worth going up there and back to Dallas.

26:48.165 --> 26:54.313
Back here on the campus, now you didn't go away to summer...

26:54.462 --> 27:22.191
uh training camp for all i didn't my after my sophomore year i didn't stay with the army all right did you wear civilian clothes to class you were you wore a uniform with the outfits and wore my uh uh field artillery just like were you all called were you all called dnc no we were called nm

27:23.032 --> 27:24.036
Non-military.

27:24.377 --> 27:25.522
NM, oh, okay.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.534
Did anybody make fun of you because you were?

27:28.575 --> 27:30.884
No, no, there's quite a few that didn't.

27:30.904 --> 27:33.615
What, reckon what percentage were NMs?

27:35.080 --> 27:37.683
Oh, it wasn't very big.

27:38.844 --> 27:40.106
Third, fourth?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.729
Maybe, fourth, maybe, maybe fourth, yeah.

27:44.691 --> 27:48.796
As NMs, did you still go to any formations or anything like that?

27:48.916 --> 27:52.760
We still had marching every Wednesday.

27:52.780 --> 27:53.221
Sure did.

27:54.222 --> 27:56.665
Now, did you buy some senior boots?

27:57.366 --> 27:58.687
Oh, no, no, no.

27:58.707 --> 27:59.668
I never had a senior.

28:00.269 --> 28:03.653
In fact, I didn't even have a...

28:07.092 --> 28:07.933
a uniform.

28:08.394 --> 28:18.630
I had to borrow a uniform when we had to do marching or like when we went to on a court trip, you know.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.614
Describe a court trip in those days.

28:22.936 --> 28:33.032
Well, the only one I went to, we had the

28:35.341 --> 28:38.546
get up and feed the students.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.853
See me like it was around four o'clock in the morning.

28:43.835 --> 28:45.317
They had to march down there.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.501
Then they had to march to the train.

28:49.143 --> 28:50.445
And we went on the train.

28:51.607 --> 28:52.489
And that's the only.

28:52.749 --> 28:54.412
Where did you go to?

28:54.832 --> 28:55.293
Dallas.

28:55.313 --> 28:55.854
To Dallas.

28:58.138 --> 29:01.263
And did you spend that night in Dallas or come back?

29:02.224 --> 29:02.665
No.

29:07.657 --> 29:09.239
I guess so.

29:09.259 --> 29:10.341
I guess we must have.

29:11.522 --> 29:12.964
I don't remember at all.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.368
Was it any problems?

29:15.508 --> 29:18.131
Nobody did anything bad to you all?

29:19.313 --> 29:20.935
And you marched in downtown Dallas.

29:21.376 --> 29:22.758
Marched in downtown Dallas.

29:24.100 --> 29:28.125
And I was going with this girl, and I met her over there in Dallas.

29:29.287 --> 29:34.474
And we didn't go to the ball game.

29:37.643 --> 29:41.528
Other than that, well, there wasn't very much.

29:43.450 --> 29:45.433
And they got beat then.

29:45.873 --> 29:46.093
Uh-oh.

29:46.414 --> 29:48.296
They weren't winning many ball games.

29:51.360 --> 29:51.821
Let's see.

29:51.861 --> 29:59.070
Here around the campus, where did the guys that were going out to party, where did they go?

30:00.431 --> 30:01.593
Where'd they go to drink beer?

30:03.034 --> 30:05.097
Hard Liquors is the only place I know of.

30:06.298 --> 30:06.739
That's only

30:07.141 --> 30:29.892
You could see them walking down all afternoon down there, and he had a grocery store, and then on one side of it he had a beer hall, and they could serve sandwiches and things in there.

30:31.711 --> 30:38.360
As far as you and other students know, how old did somebody have to be to buy a beer at Hard Liquors?

30:40.603 --> 30:41.625
You know, I don't know.

30:41.925 --> 30:43.888
Did you ever hear of somebody not getting a beer?

30:44.689 --> 30:48.815
Not down there because, you know, I still don't drink beer.

30:48.955 --> 30:59.069
No, no, but I... And I still... I just never did go to it because I didn't like beer.

30:59.209 --> 30:59.710
I just...

31:00.483 --> 31:04.026
Now, did people go across Whiskey Bridge?

31:04.106 --> 31:09.992
Was that... Well, they had whiskey and all over there.

31:10.312 --> 31:13.315
And then that little place was already there?

31:13.555 --> 31:14.816
Yes, it was there.

31:16.257 --> 31:17.118
It sure was.

31:17.138 --> 31:18.759
And I guess they sold a lot.

31:18.800 --> 31:24.224
Did students... Were the clay pits... Were they there yet?

31:26.246 --> 31:28.228
You know, I...
