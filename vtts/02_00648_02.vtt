WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:03.663
You're going to have trouble with that. That's 
something they can see. And they did.

00:11.712 --> 00:22.183
But actually it turned out that the fishermen 
learned that the area where they had been dumping

00:11.712 --> 00:22.183
this acid was known as the acid ground and was a very 
good area to fish in. So I haven't heard from that

00:24.125 --> 00:26.528
for quite a long time. So you primarily raised 
funds in from private sources here during the war

00:28.043 --> 00:33.030
for biology, or after the war. Excuse me.

00:39.159 --> 00:42.745
Primarily then you have private funds coming in 
for your work right after the war. Very small,

00:44.427 --> 00:46.370
relatively speaking. But that was all they had to 
run the biology on, that and a little bit of the

00:47.111 --> 00:53.921
institution. And that held on for... where it 
really held on for the rest of my time, which ended

00:58.570 --> 01:05.299
in 1956 when I retired. Now the National Science 
Foundation has taken over and

01:07.141 --> 01:19.037
gives very large grants for biology. That was not 
true then, sir. What? That was not true then. What

01:24.404 --> 01:27.868
sort of biology are you working on between 1945 and 
1956? Well, it was this problem of pollution. We

01:33.807 --> 01:36.449
worked for the National Lid Company, as I told you. 
Then the next job was for a group that were building

01:37.610 --> 01:48.301
a great trunk sewer down the Raritan Valley. The 
Raritan Valley had become a great industrialized

01:48.982 --> 01:52.465
area. It had grown very rapidly. And the little 
local sewers were inadequate to take care of. And

01:59.303 --> 02:10.377
so they conceived the idea of all getting together 
and building a trunk sewer down to the head of

01:59.303 --> 02:10.377
Raritan Bay and dumping it into the Raritan Bay. 
And we were engaged to study Raritan Bay in that

02:10.677 --> 02:16.565
connection. Then the oyster industry in Great 
South Bay had difficulty. And they engaged us in

02:23.434 --> 02:28.500
some of the local towns, Islip and and so engaged us 
to study the pollution of Laritan Bay by duck

02:29.206 --> 02:36.396
farms.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.403
And what did you discover in that? Did it affect the 
oysters? Oh, it absolutely ruined the oyster

02:43.146 --> 02:46.731
industry. I don't believe there's an oyster 
raised in Great South Bay anymore. The famous Blue

02:52.779 --> 02:54.461
Point oyster. Yeah. Blue Point is in Laritan Bay. 
But the viewpoint oysters now all come from either

02:59.682 --> 03:05.669
Long Island Sound or New Jersey or somewhere else.

03:08.472 --> 03:19.804
The oysters simply stopped feeding on this water 
and soared to death and became nothing but so much

03:08.472 --> 03:19.804
water.

03:22.788 --> 03:24.670
What was Columbus Island like to work for? Oh,

03:24.710 --> 03:29.335
he was very easy to work for.

03:33.719 --> 03:51.345
What sort of man was he?

03:51.366 --> 03:55.291
I think Roger has just written a memoir about him. I 
remember he's consulting me, and I tell him.

03:59.257 --> 04:01.701
Roger's insistence insists that Columbus and 
Henry Bigelow were amateurs. I think it's a little

04:05.607 --> 04:10.735
bit overdrawn there. I think I would shade him down 
a bit.

04:18.266 --> 04:27.239
But as you know, he was a man, I would say that he was 
born into a wealthy family. I don't know how

04:27.500 --> 04:31.165
wealthy or whether it was great wealth or moderate 
wealth, but I don't think he ever worried very much

04:31.853 --> 04:36.178
about how he earned his living. And he went to 
Harvard. His family background was in banking.

04:43.427 --> 04:49.154
And he assumed as a young man, or as a boy, that he was 
going to become a banker. So he specialized in

04:49.855 --> 04:52.839
mathematics. I don't think he ever did any really 
mathematical work, except not original work, at

04:54.161 --> 05:01.810
any rate. the calculations he had to make for his 
Gulf Stream currents and so on were based on

05:02.195 --> 05:12.468
mathematical ideas, but they weren't his ideas. 
He was following well-laid-down prescriptions.

05:22.762 --> 05:30.632
But he was also brought up on the water at the head of 
Long Island Sound and was a very good sailor.

05:33.160 --> 05:52.150
And

05:33.160 --> 05:52.150
while he was in college,

05:33.160 --> 05:52.150
he

05:33.160 --> 05:52.150
got hold of a ship, a schooner,

05:33.160 --> 05:52.150
and made a cruise to Labrador. And he thought, 
well, possibly he could do some scientific work on

05:52.190 --> 06:00.383
this cruise.

06:01.223 --> 06:13.974
So he went to see Professor Bigelow, who was at 
Harvard, who was the fish expert and the jellyfish

06:01.223 --> 06:13.974
expert, essentially, but who had been doing this 
work in the Gulf of Maine. And Bigelow helped him

06:14.715 --> 06:19.078
get some apparatus and told him what to do. And then 
he went back and became Bigelow's student. He

06:27.085 --> 06:30.488
never took his doctor's degree at Harvard or 
anywhere else.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.413
He never thought his work was worth it. He didn't. 
And

06:38.915 --> 06:50.774
that sort of shows how naive one can be and how naive 
students are about the doctor's thesis. Yes. You

06:53.559 --> 06:55.642
probably have that problem in history also. We do 
indeed have that problem in history, believe me.

06:58.687 --> 06:58.787
Yes.

07:02.682 --> 07:07.707
How was the institution changing in the 50s while 
you were here? Was there an influx of new people?

07:10.170 --> 07:11.872
Did it seem to change in a new direction?

07:17.178 --> 07:19.180
Well, it has grown, of course, tremendously.

07:22.223 --> 07:30.512
It has changed because

07:22.223 --> 07:30.512
the board of directors, the board of trustees, are 
no longer scientists. They are predominantly

07:34.609 --> 07:40.136
successful administrators of business. And 
they're a very fine lot of fellows, and very wise, I

07:41.317 --> 07:46.062
think, probably. But there are practically no 
scientists amongst them. Or if they have been

07:52.650 --> 07:54.892
scientists, it's so remote. And there certainly 
are no oceanographers amongst them. Now,

08:00.428 --> 08:24.151
originally,

08:00.428 --> 08:24.151
particularly during this period, immediately 
after the war,

08:00.428 --> 08:24.151
the trustees were people like Aethels and 
Spielhaus, Brian Wilson, Detlef Planck.

08:25.232 --> 08:29.997
Well, that's enough to illustrate that. Spike 
Cole, and so on. All of which were scientists, most

08:36.353 --> 08:42.020
of which had worked in Woods Hole. And those 
trustees meetings used to be damn good fun,

08:42.781 --> 08:49.931
because these fellows knew each other very well. 
They fought amongst one another. You had

08:52.674 --> 08:55.698
wonderful arguments about every question that 
came up. Now the trustees meetings are so dull that

09:00.655 --> 09:03.658
I decide I won't go to them, and I usually do go. But 
we all sit in a big room, and we hear the director

09:03.678 --> 09:12.027
read a report on the wonderful things the 
institution is doing. Of course it's wonderful.

09:12.988 --> 09:18.793
He wouldn't say it otherwise.

09:19.835 --> 09:30.105
The growth in size, the amount of money which is 
available, I'm simply shocked at the amount which

09:19.835 --> 09:30.105
is spent by practically beginning people.

09:39.210 --> 09:44.779
I have never gotten more than one grant to support 
my work. When I retired, I applied for a grant for

09:45.460 --> 09:52.391
$10,000 to study salt marshes. I suspect they were 
an awful long time granting that money. I suspect

09:59.549 --> 10:04.716
they couldn't quite decide where the soil marshes 
fitted in. And

10:04.756 --> 10:24.363
I spent, I suppose, 80% of that simply on having 
chemical analyses made for carbon-14, which we

10:04.756 --> 10:24.363
were not set up to make and which were quite 
expensive. The rest were to hire boys to help me in

10:24.383 --> 10:28.729
the summer to do the heavy helped me with the heavy 
work.

10:34.415 --> 10:36.798
They have more money than that now, certainly. 
They get more money than that now, certainly. Oh,

10:40.181 --> 10:41.002
$10,000.

10:43.945 --> 10:44.585
That's nothing. I don't think they look at less 
than $100,000 for one year of

10:44.605 --> 10:53.374
work. I worked for 10 years on $10,000. You spent 10 
years on the salt marshes before? Yeah.

11:04.420 --> 11:07.244
What did you finally publish on the salt marshes? 
What was your final paper on the salt marshes?

11:09.626 --> 11:16.395
Well, my final paper was published in 1973, I 
think, on the development. When I retired in 1956,

11:27.805 --> 11:33.211
or 55 when I was 60 or 65 years old. I retired just as 
early as I could. 55 to 65 was the retirement age.

11:45.964 --> 11:51.350
They, in exceptional cases, might ask you to stay 
on for an additional four years. But I didn't want

11:52.151 --> 11:53.332
to do that. And so I retired just as quickly as I 
could. The afternoon that I finally moved my last

11:58.315 --> 12:12.295
piece of junk out of my office up here, I went over to 
Barnstable and tried out a piece of apparatus,

11:58.315 --> 12:12.295
which worked. I went over the next day and tested 
another piece of apparatus, and it worked. And I

12:20.627 --> 12:25.774
worked for 10 years studying the development of 
this marsh.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.229
Sounds like a wonderful retirement to me. Spend 10 
years on your own work. It was a lot of fun. Then at

12:35.673 --> 12:42.219
the end of 10 years, when I was 75 years or more, I 
began to get awkward. And I fell overboard several

12:43.200 --> 12:45.002
times. And I realized I'd better not go out on small 
boats anymore. And then some time after that, my

12:51.968 --> 12:54.790
eyes went out. I had cataracts. So I can't see very 
well. So that's what the end of actual field work.

13:10.313 --> 13:26.187
And so since that time, I have been working on the 
tides of the New England coast, which are all

13:10.313 --> 13:26.187
described in the tide tables and carefully 
measured in thousands of places to see. but never

13:26.268 --> 13:32.378
put together as a whole by anybody, so far as I know. 
And I have been, well, I started out with the idea of

13:32.418 --> 13:50.166
writing a book about the tides of the New England 
coast, which is a very interesting area because it

13:32.418 --> 13:50.166
contains illustrations of practically all the 
tidal phenomena which are important in the world.

13:52.323 --> 13:55.346
And you see, we have the largest tides in the world. 
We have reversing falls, so-called, at St. John

13:55.406 --> 13:59.991
and so on. And I thought a book of that sort would be a 
good bit of interest and value to people who lived

14:01.453 --> 14:11.283
or spent their summers along this coast. And there 
are a lot of them. And then I found that I couldn't

14:13.946 --> 14:20.693
write that book because I couldn't put into the 
into a popular book, things which the experts

14:22.006 --> 14:28.011
would not recognize and take for granted. And so I 
had to write a paper for the experts, which I'm now

14:29.693 --> 14:35.979
working on.

14:40.383 --> 14:43.465
Whether I live long enough to write the book, I 
don't know. But at the moment, chances are pretty

14:43.545 --> 14:50.832
good that the experts at least will get their 
story. Yeah. Woods Hole must have been a

14:55.475 --> 14:58.719
delightful place in the 40s and 50s. Certainly a 
lovely place. Well, it was a more delightful place

15:00.741 --> 15:08.169
in the 15s and 20s. It was, huh? Did you ever foresee 
it becoming the kind of institution it became

15:12.334 --> 15:15.698
today? Did you ever foresee it becoming the kind of 
institution it became today? No.

15:22.958 --> 15:28.224
It was just sort of a place a person went to work and 
enjoy. Yes. Oh, I knew that the MBL was a great

15:29.686 --> 15:41.801
institution, perhaps the greatest marine 
laboratory in the world at that time. And it would

15:42.582 --> 15:44.224
continue to be such.

15:48.589 --> 15:51.953
Of course, the oceanographic was an 
afterthought. And I did not conceive of us

15:52.793 --> 16:02.707
becoming, receiving the support to become the 
large institution it now has.

16:10.037 --> 16:19.290
What was the sort of reaction around Woods Hole the 
first time the big boats came in after World War II?

16:20.468 --> 16:23.632
when the Atlantis is created and so forth for you? 
Well, I don't think that

16:24.073 --> 16:32.605
Woods Hole was very much surprised by anything. 
This place has been a seaport for a good many years.

16:39.414 --> 16:49.969
You see, back in the 70s and 80s and 90s, there was 
the Guiano Works here, and ships came from the

16:39.414 --> 16:49.969
Pacific loaded with Guiano. and from other parts 
of the world with other materials, so that they

16:50.793 --> 17:02.807
were quite used to having the biggest ships that 
existed at that time come into this harbor. And

17:05.270 --> 17:10.276
then that fell through, and the laboratories 
came. They operated smaller than steam ships,

17:10.316 --> 17:19.467
steamboats, boats 40, 50, 50 feet long, you see. 
with little steam engines in them. And then the

17:22.587 --> 17:31.415
Atlantis was the biggest sailing vessel, which 
was then built at that time. But that wasn't so

17:32.976 --> 17:34.858
much, you know. They were quite used to seeing 
large yachts go through and so on and stuff here.

17:39.062 --> 17:49.251
And then the further additions came gradually, 
year after year, ship after ship, bigger and

17:39.062 --> 17:49.251
bigger.

17:52.133 --> 17:59.502
I don't think there was any great shock involved of 
that sort to the community.

18:03.887 --> 18:12.277
To the institution, what was the sort of reaction 
among the faculty when for the first time it was

18:03.887 --> 18:12.277
discovered you'd go out to deep sea? When you 
discovered you'd go out to deep sea with vessels,

18:13.679 --> 18:17.263
what's up?

18:29.832 --> 18:34.018
I don't quite put your question into its context. I 
was thinking, what was the reaction of the older

18:34.038 --> 18:48.417
members of the faculty when it becomes apparent 
that with changes and innovation in

18:34.038 --> 18:48.417
oceanography, that you're going to be able to do 
deep sea research, just not sound and coastal? No,

18:48.437 --> 18:50.080
in the first place, there was no faculty. Ah, OK. 
I'm in staff. Yeah, those were the staff. And in the

18:56.292 --> 19:01.517
second place, the Atlantis was built to do work in 
the open sea. It used to regularly go to Bermuda. It

19:04.860 --> 19:06.621
was built in Copenhagen. It came across to 
somewhere south of Greenland and made a section

19:07.242 --> 19:19.032
down the center of the Atlantic to, I guess, as far 
as Bermuda, and then came in. And it used to go three

19:19.092 --> 19:23.736
or four times a year to Bermuda. And every... it 
would make a cruise through the Caribbean, so that

19:26.077 --> 19:35.266
going into deep water was not a novelty to the set. 
It was just a part of it all. Ah, good.

19:43.774 --> 19:48.619
I would like to have seen Woods Hole in 1915, 16, or 
17. I bet it was a gorgeous place. Still is a

19:51.862 --> 19:52.843
gorgeous place. Well, of course, in those days it 
was a very simple little town. I think the streets

19:58.327 --> 20:01.651
were not paved. Certainly only the main street was 
paved. The sidewalks were not paved. There were no

20:06.536 --> 20:07.477
curves. Those came after or during the First World 
War. And I can remember at the end of the war how

20:12.603 --> 20:22.594
much, how dressed up the town looked. coming back 
and finding the curves set in, sidewalks built.

20:32.398 --> 20:37.244
They used to be just paths through the grass where 
you walked along beside the dirt road.

20:41.850 --> 20:47.957
See, that would be

20:41.850 --> 20:47.957
nice.

20:51.245 --> 21:02.722
When

20:51.245 --> 21:02.722
you were at Harvard and came down here, was the 
faculty at Harvard happy that you were going to

20:51.245 --> 21:02.722
work in the lab?

21:07.469 --> 21:10.534
Well, the faculty, as such, of course, was utterly 
indifferent to me. No, there's been a long

21:12.878 --> 21:19.868
tradition at Harvard. of working somewhere in the 
summer. Professor Mark, who was quite an older

21:23.625 --> 21:39.202
member of the faculty at the time when I was a 
student, I suppose he was 60 years old when I was 17

21:23.625 --> 21:39.202
or 18, you see. He started a little laboratory in 
Mervilla and used to take

21:49.261 --> 21:52.065
some of the graduate students down there every 
summer. And then Dr. Parker, who was my professor,

21:53.287 --> 22:06.767
with whom I did my doctor's work, came down to Woods 
Hole pretty regularly and brought one or two

21:53.287 --> 22:06.767
students down with him. So there had existed a 
tradition of going to someplace to work during the

22:08.430 --> 22:18.525
summer along the shore, either Bermuda or Woods 
Hole. And then here it was chosen. It must have been

22:23.679 --> 22:32.948
a marvelous relationship between Harvard and the 
institutions around here to come down here and

22:23.679 --> 22:32.948
work. Well,

22:34.549 --> 22:48.462
I think the good relation is the fact that 
dependents are often due on the fact that there was

22:34.549 --> 22:48.462
no relation.

22:49.403 --> 22:52.807
Harvard, you know, is somewhat sooty. Yes. You've 
heard that. Yeah, I've heard that. Some people

22:55.149 --> 23:02.177
have been amazed as

22:55.149 --> 23:02.177
much. No, I remember, I

23:03.838 --> 23:17.773
forget who told me this, but at all events, someone 
representing the oceanographic talked to the

23:03.838 --> 23:17.773
dean at Harvard. about

23:18.901 --> 23:29.437
credit for work at Harvard down at Woods Hole, 
which we were practically willing, of course, to

23:18.901 --> 23:29.437
give. I mean, worked hard, and honestly, we were 
willing to say so. It was explained to him that

23:32.622 --> 23:47.305
Harvard gave credit to the students of Professor 
Bigelow and Professor Redfield of Harvard, not to

23:48.685 --> 23:53.610
the Woodsville Oceanographic Institution as 
such. Do you see?

23:59.035 --> 24:14.490
I think one of the reasons I'm not very sympathetic 
with the modern development here, with the

23:59.035 --> 24:14.490
formalization of education, for example, the 
institution granting degrees and so on, I think

24:15.179 --> 24:28.174
that we gave every opportunity that is given today 
to the graduate student at Harvard or Tech or Brown

24:15.179 --> 24:28.174
or where have you who wanted to come and work with 
whoever was here.

24:31.138 --> 24:37.285
It was all done on a personal basis, man to man, not 
institution to institution. But then education

24:37.905 --> 24:43.532
is man to man and not institution to institution. 
Nobody is educated by Harvard or Texas A&M.

24:52.886 --> 24:57.351
Those institutions draw rather broad lines 
around what the man does. But he is really educated

24:57.991 --> 25:07.401
by the staff which is picked by those institutions 
as individuals.

25:12.466 --> 25:13.907
Gee, that's true.

25:16.064 --> 25:17.466
And you always preferred it that way? I personally 
have preferred it that way. I've never greatly

25:19.850 --> 25:22.374
consulted in the matter. Now, you're a trustee, 
though, aren't you? I'm a trustee emeritus, or an

25:26.900 --> 25:30.386
honorary trustee. I forget what they're called. 
They're called different things in different

25:32.168 --> 25:34.091
places. But essentially, all these 
institutions, when you get to being a trustee,

25:34.732 --> 25:44.367
they now put a retirement age, you see, on it. And so 
they won't be managed by a lot of old fogies. And

25:49.803 --> 25:53.346
then they just want to be kind to these old fellas. 
And so as they kick them upstairs, they make them

25:54.067 --> 26:00.354
honorary or emeritus trustees in special class. 
They send them all the notices, all the print

26:00.374 --> 26:06.119
managers, but they don't let them vote. They don't 
talk. But they don't have to do anything about the

26:08.462 --> 26:13.527
talking, because they don't let them vote.

26:17.135 --> 26:18.977
I think you have guests who have arrived. Yeah, 
that's my daughter who has driven up from New

26:18.997 --> 26:24.042
Jersey. Oh, very good. I will take no more of your 
time, but I have enjoyed meeting you. It's one of

26:30.207 --> 26:31.689
those things I wanted to do. So I'm glad I called you 
up and got a chance to come by. I enjoyed talking to

26:34.992 --> 26:36.273
you. I hate it just to disturb you on the phone, but I 
thought that was the easiest way. Oh, yes, well, it

26:42.799 --> 26:45.522
was very convenient. I was with Al Vine when I 
called over at the place and just called away.
