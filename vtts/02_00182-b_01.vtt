WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:04.027
finishes. Okay,

00:04.047 --> 00:12.498
well, anyway, I was fortunate enough to be one of 
the winners. There were three winners. Once they

00:14.020 --> 00:16.924
had the highest grade on these exams. And the other 
two winners were an individual named JW Collier.

00:26.086 --> 00:30.879
And the other was an Hispanic, Gus Pena, P-E-N-A. 
So the three of us were to go on this tour. And

00:34.749 --> 00:42.289
Professor Mogford, the cotton expert, had been 
taking the tour every time for the last several

00:34.749 --> 00:42.289
years. I think either he or maybe it was his wife 
getting tired of him being gone all summer. So they

00:47.540 --> 00:52.906
elected Dr. Trotter to go, the head of the 
department. So Dr. Trotter took the three of us on

00:53.047 --> 00:57.312
this tour. And I'll go over it briefly. We spent 
about three weeks in the United States traveling

01:01.496 --> 01:06.903
in a car, Dr. Trotter's car. There were four of us in 
the car and all our luggage. We left College

01:09.826 --> 01:25.413
Station and went across the southeast through 
Louisiana, Alabama, and so forth, stopping at

01:09.826 --> 01:25.413
experiment stations on the way, and supposedly, 
anyway, studying cotton and our other local

01:09.826 --> 01:25.413
matters. But we got all the way over to the east 
coast and then went up the east coast to... through

01:32.405 --> 01:49.086
Virginia and then up to Washington, D.C., and 
spent two or three days in Washington with some of

01:32.405 --> 01:49.086
the federal people there interested, ran the 
cotton programs, and then went up to New York for

01:32.405 --> 01:49.086
two or three days and went to the cotton exchange, I 
guess it was. There where they marketed the cotton

01:50.307 --> 01:55.594
and visited some of the people there and generally 
had a great time and we had some entertainment. I'm

01:58.640 --> 02:00.783
sure we went to one or two shows. I guess we went to 
the Rockettes at Rockefeller Center. So that was,

02:06.411 --> 02:08.935
this was big for all of us. We, the students, we 
hadn't hardly been out of the state, I guess, at

02:09.015 --> 02:13.983
that time. Well, no, I'd been out, but not to any 
extent. This, certainly never been to the East

02:18.189 --> 02:20.853
Coast before. So it was a great occasion. The part 
in this country was great. Then we got on a ship, and

02:24.498 --> 02:31.489
it was a converted merchant ship. During the 
summer, these shipping lines would refit some of

02:31.549 --> 02:39.861
their transport ships to carry passengers during 
the summer. We had about 100 people on there, and it

02:40.342 --> 02:43.587
was all one class. And it was just great. Everybody 
was friendly and there were plenty of girls on

02:45.014 --> 02:49.438
board. There were a lot of them teachers or high 
school, excuse me, college students. And they

02:56.406 --> 02:58.448
were all all over the country. So it was, the voyage 
was really quite interesting. We left New York and

03:04.694 --> 03:10.620
landed at, What's the port in England? Liverpool. 
Liverpool, yeah. I kept saying Manchester,

03:17.039 --> 03:18.962
Birmingham. I knew when he landed at Liverpool. It 
was about a 10-day trip. It was not a fast ship, as

03:22.347 --> 03:26.173
you might expect, something like that. But it was 
really an enjoyable occasion. Then we spent about

03:30.099 --> 03:36.388
three or four weeks in England and on the continent 
going around. through the cotton mills and cotton

03:36.622 --> 03:47.512
exchanges, anything, dealing with cotton and 
some entertainment off and on. Well, we got off at

03:47.973 --> 04:03.828
Liverpool and then went to Manchester, which is 
the main mill town, and to London, and went across

03:47.973 --> 04:03.828
the English Channel from Dover to Calais. No, we 
landed in Belgium. What would that have been? I

04:07.739 --> 04:10.542
can't think of, Austin, Austin, Belgium. That was 
a few hour trip, as I recall. And then went some

04:16.788 --> 04:22.634
meals in Belgium, then to Germany. We made a trip 
down the Rhine one day, which really was

04:22.674 --> 04:29.041
informative, interesting. Did you see, the 
German part of the trip, did you see any evidences

04:29.441 --> 04:35.367
of Nazism? I want to tell you this, and it's easy to 
say in retrospect, but you would have had to have

04:37.338 --> 04:47.230
been blind, deaf, and dumb not to know that the 
Nazis were getting ready for something. They were

04:47.830 --> 04:57.061
just troops marching, not marching, just 
everywhere, moving here, moving there, and this

04:47.830 --> 04:57.061
was the summer of 1938.

05:00.064 --> 05:06.552
Well, I paid attention to it, but I wasn't in a 
position really evaluating it, but it was just,

05:06.987 --> 05:10.230
Why in the world would they have all these troops 
around if they were going to do something? And what

05:10.370 --> 05:14.614
was next year that they marched into Poland? But 
they were all busy and active and moving. And the

05:19.498 --> 05:26.164
ships were up and down the Rhine were loaded with 
coal, iron, various resources. And it sure looked

05:26.364 --> 05:33.210
obvious that something was going to take place 
there. And, yeah, there were the Browns. suited

05:37.058 --> 06:05.850
fellows with the swastika on their sleeves one 
thing that surprised me is that on this ride down

05:37.058 --> 06:05.850
the rhine that day half the germans on there or more 
seemed they could speak enough english you could

05:37.058 --> 06:05.850
communicate with them and i remember visiting 
with two or three different germans one of them was

05:37.058 --> 06:05.850
a girl there who was i guess she was in college 
somewhere but she could talk English quite well.

06:10.046 --> 06:15.081
Mainly talked about where she was going to school, 
what she was doing, something about the country.

06:15.719 --> 06:26.753
We spent altogether two or three days there in 
Germany and went down the Rhine and I believe we got

06:15.719 --> 06:26.753
off at Mainz. I think we got on at Cologne and off at 
Mainz and went into Switzerland. That wasn't much

06:32.500 --> 06:37.486
cotton tour in Switzerland, but Switzerland's a 
beautiful place to see. We went to Lake Lucerne, I

06:37.947 --> 06:40.490
guess it was. This is all kind of amazing for... 
small town people who hadn't been anywhere at age

06:44.255 --> 06:48.761
21.

06:52.365 --> 07:02.078
From a few days in Switzerland, we went on to France 
and Paris for a few days and saw the Folies Bougier

06:52.365 --> 07:02.078
for the first time. So this wasn't all work.

07:07.645 --> 07:13.452
Then we went across France to tours, I believe.

07:15.862 --> 07:18.587
And then on to Laharve. I was trying to think of the 
port where we departed from. I couldn't think for

07:22.093 --> 07:26.540
the moment, but got on the ship coming back at 
Laharve. And for some reason, they mixed up our

07:27.582 --> 07:37.219
tickets or changed their shipping schedules. And 
we were given first-class accommodations on this

07:41.326 --> 07:42.047
ship. It was a regular class ship. It was a big ship 
with several hundred people, pastors on board.

07:49.581 --> 07:57.715
And to show you how limited my background was, it 
was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I

07:57.735 --> 07:58.437
didn't fit in. We didn't fit in with these people. 
That didn't really happen. These were Most of them

08:03.938 --> 08:13.569
wealthy people, and they had their own cliques and 
their own practices, and we just felt outside of it

08:03.938 --> 08:13.569
to some extent. Oh, it was all right, but you could 
really tell the difference. You toured cotton

08:17.314 --> 08:19.977
mills in Europe. Right. Did you tour any cotton 
mills in New England? No. I don't know whether

08:26.204 --> 08:28.427
there were any left by then. Did you tour any 
American mills? Oh, yes. Now I'm recalling a

08:33.249 --> 08:35.173
little better. I think the shift had primarily 
occurred from New England mills to the southern

08:35.213 --> 08:47.017
mills, and we went through two or three large ones 
in North Carolina and Georgia in that area. Yeah, I

08:47.037 --> 08:49.261
failed to mention that as we went through there. 
How long was this whole trip? Six months? No, no,

08:51.897 --> 08:56.861
just the summer, 10 to 12 weeks, something like 
that. We left right after school was out. Let's

09:00.664 --> 09:02.186
back up just a little now. As we're getting ready 
for you to graduate, that little doodad fell off,

09:02.206 --> 09:08.191
and it's there in the chair. No worries. No 
worries. Okay, it's still recording. As you

09:14.737 --> 09:21.162
approached commissioning and...

09:22.407 --> 09:23.929
commencement and so forth. Do you remember those 
events for you? What was commissioning and

09:27.692 --> 09:30.195
commencement like? Well, see, I wasn't eligible 
for a commission, so I wasn't involved with that. I

09:35.500 --> 09:43.949
did take the two years required basic military 
science, so I was not in on commissioning. What

09:45.691 --> 09:46.812
about graduation? Well, we had final review. I 
remember that and marched in it and graduated.

09:55.435 --> 09:59.940
Commencement was, I believe I'm correct on this, 
held in Kyle Field. I

10:01.382 --> 10:05.807
can't remember the speaker. I don't remember who 
he was. I remember I was going with Margaret then

10:07.730 --> 10:13.957
and she was up for it and my parents and so forth. 
What kind of life did you think you were getting

10:13.977 --> 10:17.541
ready to What

10:18.871 --> 10:24.156
do you think you were going to be doing in the next 
few years? Well, when I started school at A&M, this

10:24.176 --> 10:39.092
shows a limitation in my vision, I guess, but I was 
going back to Arkansas into agriculture in some

10:24.176 --> 10:39.092
form, shape, form, or fashion. But

10:40.613 --> 10:45.418
at commencement, I had not... made arrangements 
to get into graduate school yet, and I've

10:46.630 --> 10:53.960
forgotten just what the status of that was. I 
believe I'd initiated

10:53.980 --> 11:10.663
some activity there during the spring to look into 
the assistantship over in the Experiment

10:53.980 --> 11:10.663
Station.

11:11.082 --> 11:13.085
little Jocko Roberts, probably. And he was the 
student on this assistantship at that time. So I

11:19.154 --> 11:24.421
remember going over to talk to him some about it in 
the spring of 38. So by commencement time, I had

11:25.223 --> 11:30.390
some concept perhaps of continuing at A&M there in 
graduate school and working in the experiment

11:30.370 --> 11:41.086
station for at least the next step, so I wasn't 
thinking too much. I had marriage on my mind more

11:42.047 --> 11:49.678
than anything else probably right about then.

11:54.552 --> 12:03.461
Well, it was small enough that it didn't seem to be a 
big financial factor.

12:07.985 --> 12:23.800
I

12:07.985 --> 12:23.800
don't know that I can remember specifically, but 
I've on several different occasions anywhere had

12:07.985 --> 12:23.800
people recognize it and call attention to it and 
and in my case particularly there's a lot of

12:24.033 --> 12:47.526
interest generated in it when they see it they 
begin to wonder well it's practically smooth when

12:24.033 --> 12:47.526
that guy get out he might he ought to be gone by now i 
did lose it one time here this was since we moved

12:24.033 --> 12:47.526
back here one time a few years ago for about a month 
and uh The lady that cleans up every couple of weeks

12:48.974 --> 12:55.161
for it happened to locate it one day on the floor in a 
corner somewhere. So I've been ever grateful to

12:56.042 --> 12:58.185
her for it. Do you remember going to Aggie Muster as 
an undergraduate? April 21st, Muster.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.762
I can't recall that. Were they being held? Well, 
you're confirming what I have encountered in

13:14.324 --> 13:17.648
others. Most people don't remember musters until 
after World War II. And I have the impression that

13:23.770 --> 13:40.790
World War II made a great change in mustard and in 
bonfire,

13:23.770 --> 13:40.790
that those traditions became more

13:23.770 --> 13:40.790
important here. And more attention given to... 
Well, that... I'm groping for that muster

13:45.151 --> 13:54.625
experience, but I can't remember it as a student or 
even in graduate school right after that. Shirley

13:56.989 --> 13:58.231
Cain. All right, let's see. Back to your student 
days. There must have been a variety

14:01.996 --> 14:07.505
of students. As far as you recall, how were 
Hispanic American students treated? We had,

14:13.366 --> 14:26.326
again, based on my memory, one Hispanic student in 
our battery, and he was emulated almost. He was

14:26.346 --> 14:31.835
treated with extreme respect and regard and was 
just an outstanding individual. You may know this

14:32.195 --> 14:34.058
family, Reyes. I would think they've had five or 
six children. Children go through A&M, and what

14:38.375 --> 14:48.630
was, I can't think of this one's first name. I can 
visualize him, but he was, I think, a year behind

14:48.650 --> 14:54.799
me, and just a wonderful person. And last year I was 
here, his brother came in as a freshman, and then I

14:55.320 --> 15:07.217
knew another, one of the brothers that worked for 
the Experiment Station down in Beeville for years

14:55.320 --> 15:07.217
and years, and was just outstanding. Did you know 
any of the Japanese Americans? I can't remember

15:13.112 --> 15:22.523
the fellow's name, but I'm sure he's recorded 
somewhere in the NMN. He was probably a class of 37,

15:23.103 --> 15:27.609
maybe. Was this Kishi from over at Orange Field? 
The name didn't... What about Jewish students?

15:36.559 --> 15:37.660
Did you know any Jewish students? You bet. Well, I 
thought like I knew a hundred of them, but I knew one

15:39.286 --> 15:44.051
that was a scream.

15:47.335 --> 15:51.000
You know about this Japanese, I can't recall that 
fellow's name. He was an outstanding student here

15:51.020 --> 15:56.346
in the 36th, 7th, 8th, along in there. And I 
remember there was discussion about him among

15:57.828 --> 16:03.394
those of us who had known him. after the war started 
and what happened to him and where he was and did he

16:04.083 --> 16:21.332
go back to Japan and all that and I can't recall it 
but he was a stellar student and well known on the

16:04.083 --> 16:21.332
campus and I think perhaps in the core ranks 
Anyway, that was the only Japanese student I

16:22.375 --> 16:26.459
remember. Jewish students, there was a whole 
flock of them from New York or New Jersey or

16:28.500 --> 16:39.230
somewhere in the northeast going to vet school 
because they didn't have any vet schools up there.

16:39.970 --> 16:45.735
So all of them that could get in, I guess, they were 
coming here. So that was one source of Jewish

16:46.656 --> 16:51.100
students that I can't actually recall one of their 
names offhand. I remember seeing them. And were

16:56.757 --> 17:03.703
those students treated just about like everybody 
else was? I think there might have been some,

17:05.384 --> 17:13.731
not severe resentment, but they were referred to 
as a group. The out-of-state ones? Yeah, the

17:15.793 --> 17:19.537
out-of-state ones that had come down here to go to 
Beth's school. What about the Jewish students

17:19.617 --> 17:21.238
from Houston? Oh, well, I only know one of them real 
well, and his name was Ike Wexler. And there was a

17:26.181 --> 17:33.050
Wexler jewelry store in Houston, and that's where 
he came from. He was one of the funniest guys.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.737
Everything was a big joke to him. He was a heavyset 
fellow, loved to eat and have a good time, and life

17:38.797 --> 17:44.865
was just one big party to him. And I don't know 
whether, I doubt if he ever graduated, but

17:45.666 --> 17:49.251
everybody... I just liked him. I think he was in 
there in our outfit I was in or the one next in the

17:52.523 --> 18:00.713
dormitory right nearby. But I don't remember any, 
certainly wasn't any significance attached to

18:00.773 --> 18:09.183
him. In fact, he'd laugh about being a Jew. It was a 
big joke. Am I correct that in that era, Where you

18:17.902 --> 18:25.250
came from, where you worshiped or didn't worship, 
your ancestry didn't matter. You were an Agate.

18:26.652 --> 18:27.533
That was the key thing. I'd say that's a reasonable 
statement.

18:35.662 --> 18:43.510
Individuals were liked, disliked, or whatever, 
based on their particular characteristics. Now,

18:44.952 --> 18:47.014
scholars weren't especially... I don't know that 
they were dishonored, but that wasn't one of the

18:47.602 --> 18:57.874
characteristics that made a student popular or 
unpopular. And I suppose there was a little

18:57.994 --> 19:14.314
reaction to the perfect student, the one who 
followed all the rules and marched just right and

18:57.994 --> 19:14.314
was rewarded, usually with a military ranking. I 
didn't touch on that much, but the military

19:15.095 --> 19:17.558
ranking aspects of the Corps was quite 
significant. You know, who was company

19:21.154 --> 19:31.146
commander, who was the major and the lieutenant 
colonel, and certainly the cadet colonel was a

19:21.154 --> 19:31.146
tremendously important position. In terms of 
status,

19:32.548 --> 19:43.101
was the cadet colonel the highest in terms of 
student status? Recognition. Was that the

19:43.922 --> 19:46.465
highest recognition that a student could have? 
That would be my recollection. Did you all even

19:51.428 --> 19:56.233
have a student body president that you knew about? 
I don't recall one. The military ranking was a life

20:01.518 --> 20:08.726
and death matter in a way. It was the crux of the 
whole Corps at that time and really the most,

20:16.313 --> 20:28.545
rewarding position was a unit commander, or at 
least that's what I've observed and been told,

20:16.313 --> 20:28.545
that you had a company of people you were 
responsible for, and you were. I mean, they took

20:28.565 --> 20:45.021
responsibility, and of course they had a top kick, 
the sergeant, the junior, and the officers of

20:28.565 --> 20:45.021
positions, military positions above them, the 
majors, these lieutenant colonels, they were

20:28.565 --> 20:45.021
staff people, and they didn't really have They had 
jurisdiction, you might say, over four

20:45.389 --> 20:50.615
companies, but not over individuals. But the 
company commander was where the real

20:50.995 --> 20:56.342
jurisdiction came. And it affected the quality of 
the organization dramatically. Because some

21:01.547 --> 21:04.931
companies, you'd have an outstanding company 
commander. The students in there would be passing

21:06.313 --> 21:09.376
their courses. And if somebody got behind, they 
got some help, either a Either physical

21:15.730 --> 21:21.378
or metal or both. Yeah.

21:31.433 --> 21:37.362
Okay.

21:37.382 --> 21:44.573
You graduated, were away for a little while, and 
then you came back to A&M. as a member of the staff?

21:48.470 --> 21:51.393
No, I was just a graduate student at that time. We 
finished the cotton tour right about the end of the

21:52.234 --> 21:57.018
summer. And I was starting graduate school in 
September and to start on this assistant, what

21:58.279 --> 22:13.834
they called an assistantship at the time, in the 
experiment station in the agronomy part of the

21:58.279 --> 22:13.834
experiment station, which I At that time, 
Experiment Station was a separate entity from the

22:14.860 --> 22:26.772
college teaching part of the school and operated 
more or less independently. But there were

22:26.852 --> 22:40.666
graduate students throughout the Experiment 
Station that worked there and took the courses at

22:26.852 --> 22:40.666
the college, which it was called at that time. And 
that, then World War II, and then After the war,

22:44.780 --> 22:47.884
when do you return to A&M? Well, I came back in, 
let's see, I guess it was the beginning of 46.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.442
Do you want anything about the 38? Let's jump on to 
when you joined the professional staff here.

23:09.772 --> 23:10.433
After the war. Let's see. Well, I guess I went on the 
staff in 1940, actually, when I finished my

23:12.100 --> 23:23.632
degree, finished my master's degree in the summer 
of 1940. And Dr. Mangelsdorf left at that time,

23:24.933 --> 23:41.010
resigned from the Experiment Station and 
accepted a position as professor at Harvard,

23:24.933 --> 23:41.010
which is where he had gone for his graduate degree. 
So I was a mere graduate student of 23, I think, if I

23:41.986 --> 23:50.157
remember right, in 1940. And

23:50.197 --> 24:02.294
he left without a whole lot of notice, and 
obtaining replacements was becoming somewhat

23:50.197 --> 24:02.294
difficult at that time. The war wasn't far away, 
and there The military was already becoming

24:08.547 --> 24:19.603
active, so I was there on hand, and I was just asked 
to take over the program. This was an experiment

24:20.905 --> 24:24.891
station, what was called the Corn Improvement 
Program.

24:28.476 --> 24:32.462
So Dr. Mangelsdorf left, and I took over the 
program in 1940. a greatly underqualified member

24:33.337 --> 24:39.104
of the staff, you could say, at that time. And I 
think it was on somewhat of a temporary basis. I

24:43.050 --> 24:55.966
remember I was paid $200 a month, though, which was 
fantastic because I had married in 1938, soon

24:43.050 --> 24:55.966
after graduate school. I mean, soon after I 
graduated. And then my wife worked. most of the

25:01.585 --> 25:04.087
time while I was in graduate school. But then I 
could support the families somewhat on $200 a

25:05.108 --> 25:09.592
month. I have one story I wanted to mention, if it's 
agreeable to you, about my most embarrassing

25:11.494 --> 25:21.523
moment that occurred. I guess this was while I was 
in graduate school. I think I've told you a little

25:24.826 --> 25:29.770
bit previously about the cotton tour and coming 
back from that. And we were married on September

25:31.184 --> 25:35.530
30th in 1938. So I was basically married the whole 
time I was going to graduate school. And sometime

25:43.601 --> 25:49.228
in the fall of 38, I still was active in the agronomy 
department. And they were having an agronomy

25:49.308 --> 25:53.053
society meeting one night. And they invited 
myself and I think it was one or two others

25:59.568 --> 26:02.952
individuals who'd been on that cotton tour, 
previous ones anyway. The program was a cotton

26:02.992 --> 26:05.596
tour. So I took my wife. There were several women, 
faculty wives or so forth there at the meeting. It

26:14.027 --> 26:17.491
was kind of a social event as well as a meeting. And I 
was one of those giving a brief report of the cotton

26:18.292 --> 26:27.845
tour, what I thought about it and appreciated it 
and so forth. And I don't know. My mind must have

26:29.774 --> 26:33.619
been out of gear at the moment anyway. I was telling 
how much I appreciated the cotton to her and how

26:34.200 --> 26:41.671
enjoyable it had been and something I'd remember 
all my life. And then I looked down at my bride and

26:41.691 --> 26:48.400
said, in fact, I enjoyed it more than anything I've 
ever done. And I kind of looked at her and said,

26:48.440 --> 26:51.584
until I got married. That brought down the house. I 
still remember that. It was great. Fortunately,

26:59.845 --> 27:06.611
they had a film they were showing, so somebody 
turned off the lights like that. Kind of took the

27:06.631 --> 27:12.137
brunt off of it, but I've always remembered that 
faux pas. Anyway, you can imagine a room full of

27:12.697 --> 27:15.980
Aggies with a combat like that. Anyway. So you were 
on the staff until the war, and during the war.

27:25.049 --> 27:29.413
Well, I started on the staff in 1940 and took over 
the corn improvement project. And this was

27:30.035 --> 27:37.081
important, not just to me, but from the standpoint 
of the Experiment Station. The corn grown

27:38.883 --> 27:44.848
throughout the United States had been bridal corn 
up to that time. And of course, Texas, the South,

27:45.689 --> 27:53.736
was behind the Midwest in the adoption of hybrid 
corn. So Dr. Mangelfeld initiated the program to

27:54.416 --> 27:59.721
start hybrid corn for Texas. had not reached 
fruition. There was none being grown in 1940. But

28:06.473 --> 28:11.118
it was right at a point where we could introduce it 
and get it started. So it was a pretty important

28:11.138 --> 28:20.809
period right then as far as development of hybrids 
and the introduction into the Texas market. And

28:20.829 --> 28:26.635
that was the main thing that I was responsible for 
during the 40s there. And I worked Spent a lot of my

28:28.945 --> 28:36.933
time working with seed growers throughout the 
state that just started producing hybrid corn and

28:28.945 --> 28:36.933
making it available. What were the important 
steps in that program's success, as you look back

28:36.953 --> 28:44.120
on it now? Well, are you familiar with the 
procedure for developing hybrid corn? Or should I

28:52.068 --> 28:54.150
outline it and just do it briefly? Well. Hybrid 
corn is basically developed through the initial

28:57.363 --> 29:11.281
creation of inbred lines, and these are obtained 
by inbreeding a variety of corn. Dr. Mangelsdorf

29:11.442 --> 29:25.480
had taken some of the local varieties that were 
adapted to Texas here and had inbred them, that is,

29:11.442 --> 29:25.480
self-pollinate them generation after 
generation.

29:26.692 --> 29:53.020
develop inbred line from that were adapted to 
texas you couldn't just import corn from the

29:26.692 --> 29:53.020
midwest and put it down here it wasn't adapted so he 
had developed some lines adapted to texas and we

29:26.692 --> 29:53.020
were just in the process of hybridizing these 
lines to produce hybrid corn and to identify those

29:26.692 --> 29:53.020
that produced the best hybrids and this process 
continued on through the early 40s and we started

29:53.843 --> 30:01.891
introducing hybrids in 41, 42, in the early 40 
period there and worked with the seed growers. It

30:02.552 --> 30:10.440
was a good deal of time and effort expanded in the 
program throughout the state at that time. Where

30:10.460 --> 30:18.288
geographically in Texas, where was the biggest 
concentration of the early hybrid crops? I'd say

30:18.308 --> 30:20.030
in the Blackland area. In 1940, there were five 
believe it or not, five million acres of corn and

30:23.189 --> 30:28.196
the average yield was 15 bushels per acre. Hardly 
worth growing. And there was a lot of corn through

30:32.382 --> 30:43.738
the Blackland area and even on East Texas and the 
Gulf Coast and on even down toward Beville and that

30:32.382 --> 30:43.738
area there. Well, most of the state except the, you 
got west of, say, Lyon, Austin to Wichita Falls and

30:44.619 --> 30:52.690
out west where the rainfall was low. Five million 
acres representing quite important acres

30:53.412 --> 30:59.960
throughout the state. And I'd like to get this in 
there somewhere, and let me do it now if I may. One of

31:06.348 --> 31:11.735
my important experiences was in working in the 
corn improvement program. We utilized the

31:12.896 --> 31:17.863
experiment substation in Texas. You're probably 
familiar with some of them. But at that time, they

31:20.260 --> 31:35.495
were located at West Lakeland Valley and Beeville 
in the South of San Antonio area, Beaumont over in

31:20.260 --> 31:35.495
East Texas, Temple in the Black Land. That was an 
important location for us in the corn program. We

31:39.159 --> 31:43.563
even had one in Nacogdoches over in East Texas. As 
an interesting aside, it was set up in 1911, I

31:43.583 --> 31:48.748
think, for tobacco improvement.
