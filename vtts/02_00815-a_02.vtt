00:01.837 --> 00:10.128
The Hesburgh Prairie is located directly across 
the highway from the land that I now own.

00:13.632 --> 00:22.383
I am not clear how my great grandmother and my 
grandfather happened to move to the Tabor area.

00:24.165 --> 00:28.671
They lived in a community called Devil's Jump in 
Robertson County. Only the old timers know where

00:29.917 --> 00:32.681
Devil's Jump is. I have never been there. I 
understand the road is out and I have not tried to

00:33.862 --> 00:38.809
locate it. But it is located in Roberson County and 
at some time prior to the Civil War they must have

00:38.829 --> 00:53.830
moved from there down to Brazos County.

00:53.850 --> 00:59.518
A great deal is known about the Presnell family 
because of a relative that did a genealogy on the

00:59.853 --> 01:06.262
Prestons some years ago. We do know that they 
originated in France as the Huguenots who

01:06.382 --> 01:29.134
migrated to England and then were put out of 
England because of their religious bent and came

01:06.382 --> 01:29.134
to the United States and settled on the East Coast 
and eventually to Alabama, and then to Texas.

01:33.303 --> 01:38.228
There are many personals around the country 
today, and they're all related in some way or

01:33.303 --> 01:38.228
another.

01:43.453 --> 01:57.366
In contrast to my mother's family, which had very 
large families, two of them had ten children, and

01:43.453 --> 01:57.366
two had six, and the other two had three each, My 
father's family had two brothers, two sisters,

01:58.358 --> 02:10.551
and a half-sister, but

01:58.358 --> 02:10.551
his two brothers had no children at all. The oldest 
of the boys was Charlie Presnell. He farmed across

02:17.618 --> 02:24.426
the road from what we know as the old Presnell home 
place. His farm is now in a trust that my brothers

02:28.295 --> 02:36.406
and sisters owned and interested

02:28.295 --> 02:36.406
in. This land was acquired by my father upon the 
death of Charlie Preston.

02:44.677 --> 02:50.405
We have preserved just one small portion of the 
house that my Uncle Charlie lived in. We found a log

02:51.086 --> 02:57.475
cabin within his residence that was built 
probably back in the 1830s. We do not know who built

03:00.253 --> 03:10.945
the log cabin, but it certainly dates back to being 
the oldest log cabin in the county or in this area.

03:12.988 --> 03:25.162
My brother was living there at the time and was 
going to vet school and was up in the attic one day

03:12.988 --> 03:25.162
trying to fish a wire through the wall and found out 
the wall was solid. That led him to the discovery

03:25.182 --> 03:27.445
that there was a log cabin within the house that had 
been covered up and as a result was preserved. We

03:35.197 --> 03:40.526
still have that log cabin and are in the process of 
restoring it. Uncle Charlie was married to Mary

03:40.546 --> 03:49.701
Peshak, and after her death, he married Susie 
Mitchell McCallum. The youngest of the Pressmore

03:51.744 --> 03:54.529
boys was Earl Pressmore.

03:57.547 --> 04:12.811
He lived at home in the same house with his father, 
where my father had been raised, and in later years

03:57.547 --> 04:12.811
married Sue Benbow. Uncle Earl and Aunt Sue 
continued to live at home with his father, J.K.

04:12.831 --> 04:18.981
Preston. who my father ran his operation pretty 
much out of the country store that I talked about

04:20.210 --> 04:27.640
earlier. Uncle Earl was a farmer and rancher. Aunt 
Sue taught elementary grades at Bowie Elementary

04:31.726 --> 04:38.935
School in Bryan for many years. Later she taught at 
the Tabor School and was my teacher in the sixth and

04:38.955 --> 04:46.065
seventh grades. Uncle Charlie and Aunt Mary had no 
children, and likewise, Uncle Earl and Aunt Sue

04:47.142 --> 04:53.992
had no children. A sister of my father was Mara 
Holden, who was married to Walter Holden. Walter

05:05.327 --> 05:12.097
Holden was the equipment manager for the Texas A&M 
University Athletic Department for many years.

05:13.419 --> 05:14.500
They had two children.

05:18.175 --> 05:31.157
Walter Jr. And I cannot recall the daughter's 
name, although she was a ticket manager at the N. M.

05:18.175 --> 05:31.157
A department for many years. I recall when I was in 
the Commandant's office that she was a ticket

05:33.120 --> 05:40.993
manager, and I was responsible for accounting for 
all the tickets for the cadets that marched

05:41.665 --> 05:46.652
through the gates to the home football games. 
Consequently, we had numerous contacts during

05:46.912 --> 05:56.645
those football seasons in the 60s. Another sister 
of my father was Mary Kern. Aunt Mary was married to

06:01.031 --> 06:09.782
August Kern, and they lived and had rental 
property near the Travis Elementary School in

06:01.031 --> 06:09.782
Bryan. Uncle August sold Watkins products, and he 
had two children, Joe and Ruth. Ruth never married

06:17.859 --> 06:22.885
and lives in a retirement home in Asheville, North 
Carolina. Joe recently died and lived on the East

06:24.868 --> 06:32.818
Coast most of his life. A half-sister was Tilly 
Moore. Her family, as I recall, was a Chatham

06:36.342 --> 06:38.925
family. She was married to, or she was a Chatham, 
yes. She was married to Uncle John Moore, who was a

06:47.192 --> 07:02.287
well-known schoolmaster and very active in 
public education, and at one time was

06:47.192 --> 07:02.287
superintendent of schools in Brazos County. They 
had several children, three boys, Morris, Henry,

07:04.549 --> 07:10.195
and Tillman. Tillman was the oldest of the boys and 
followed in his dad's footsteps. He taught at the

07:20.983 --> 07:37.802
college level in a couple of small colleges in 
Texas during the Depression years and was later

07:20.983 --> 07:37.802
with the Federal Civil Defense and Director of 
Curriculum and Materiel at Crew Training Air

07:20.983 --> 07:37.802
Force.

07:41.140 --> 07:48.086
Tillman was instrumental in my staying at Tyndall 
Air Force Base and returning to Texas A&M to do

07:41.140 --> 07:48.086
graduate work. I also followed in Tillman's 
footsteps at West Texas State University in 1953

07:49.427 --> 08:04.940
when I took my first job there as a member of the 
faculty. Tillman was a legend at West Texas State

08:06.081 --> 08:10.725
and had provided an opportunity for many kids to go 
to school that otherwise would not have been able

08:11.566 --> 08:21.120
to attend during the Depression days when no one 
had any money.

08:23.985 --> 08:34.941
He was in charge of the farm operation and had a 
number of the boys living on the farm and were able

08:23.985 --> 08:34.941
to subsist by eating their own produce.

08:38.127 --> 08:39.329
Tillman, or T.M. Moore, had a Ph.D. from Iowa State 
and was anxious for me to attend that institution,

08:39.349 --> 08:54.829
but I decided instead to return to Texas A&M and 
ended up getting a master's degree here in about

08:39.349 --> 08:54.829
1959. I'll have a little bit more to say about Dr. 
T.M. Moore later and the influence that he had on my

08:59.555 --> 09:05.603
life. This is chapter three titled On My Own. In 
1953, when I graduated from Texas A&M University,

09:12.112 --> 09:27.540
I was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 
U.S. Air Force and fully expected to report to

09:12.112 --> 09:27.540
active duty within a few days. Actually, I had six 
weeks from graduation time to the day I was

09:28.516 --> 09:36.344
supposed to report to active duty. I took a job with 
one of my professors for 30 days painting his

09:36.364 --> 09:48.236
three-story home on Texas Avenue.

09:49.857 --> 09:57.325
After I had completed that, just days before I was 
to pack up and go off to my first tour of duty, first

09:58.368 --> 10:11.986
duty station, I got orders that my orders, I got a 
telegram that my orders had been canceled. I

10:12.006 --> 10:23.522
immediately went to Texas A&M and met with the 
military people here to see what they could tell me

10:12.006 --> 10:23.522
what all this meant. They did not know, but they 
said that because the Korean War was over that I

10:27.815 --> 10:49.560
would probably be called a little later and that 
because the war being over they had decided to

10:27.815 --> 10:49.560
postpone calling some of us in, our whole class in 
for that matter.

10:49.580 --> 10:52.303
After I left the Office of the Commandant in 
Military Sciences, Air Sciences, I went over to my

10:52.604 --> 11:11.927
department, the Dairy Science Department, and 
looked on the bulletin board, talked to some of my

10:52.604 --> 11:11.927
professors, former professors, and sought their 
advice as to what I could do. One of the jobs that was

11:12.988 --> 11:18.915
posted was a faculty position at West Texas State 
University. After discussing various

11:20.768 --> 11:31.645
possibilities with one of my major professors, I 
decided that I would apply for the job at West Texas

11:20.768 --> 11:31.645
State. I went home and told my father about it, and 
he said, well, that's where Tillman spent most of

11:33.267 --> 11:41.239
his life, your cousin. I did not at that time know 
Tillman Moore very well, except just to hear of

11:42.561 --> 11:48.210
him. because he was not in Bryan that much and had 
always lived away. But at the time, he was in San

11:54.128 --> 11:59.996
Antonio working for the US Air Force. That was 
about the extent of my knowledge. I contacted

12:03.540 --> 12:13.893
Cousin Tillman and told him that I was applying for 
a job at West Texas State. I've always believed

12:13.913 --> 12:18.298
that he contacted some of his old contacts up there 
who were students of his at the time and now were

12:18.515 --> 12:38.704
some of the top administrators in the university 
and may have had some bearing on my being able to be

12:18.515 --> 12:38.704
so accepted at West Texas State. I don't know what 
he did, but I suspect he at least made one or two

12:38.724 --> 12:43.611
calls.

12:46.493 --> 12:50.339
I spent a very memorable year at West Texas State. I 
developed a curriculum for their dairy courses

12:50.639 --> 13:05.021
and began, spent most of my time beginning the 
operation of a dairy farm. The dairy farm had not

13:05.041 --> 13:12.012
been operated there since my cousin left back in 
the 40s. And there was some reluctance to start it

13:13.004 --> 13:20.817
up again, but if they wanted to have an agriculture 
program, they felt like they needed a dairy. So

13:22.059 --> 13:26.386
that was my first charge, was to finish building 
the facilities. And the cattle had been

13:27.147 --> 13:38.185
purchased, but to get those cattle into the milk 
barn and start the operation up. This was quite a

13:39.110 --> 13:51.365
challenge for a young man, 21 years of age, and also 
having to develop a course curriculum at the same

13:39.110 --> 13:51.365
time. I had been attending an all-male college, 
and it was quite a different experience to be in a

13:51.385 --> 14:00.836
co-ed college. And it was a great temptation on me 
to date some of the co-eds. I decided at first that I

14:09.080 --> 14:15.926
would date only seniors since they were more my 
age. Well, it didn't take long until I had run

14:16.667 --> 14:29.979
through the senior class and began to date some of 
the young ladies that were in the lower classes.

14:29.999 --> 14:39.087
One of the people that I had a date with had a 
roommate.

14:40.788 --> 14:53.764
I didn't know at the time who her roommate was, but I 
found out later it was someone that I had always

14:40.788 --> 14:53.764
admired on the campus, but knew that she was going 
steady with one of my students. So I never thought

14:55.086 --> 14:57.669
about dating her. But because of the fact that my 
roommate was going home one weekend and I had to

14:58.510 --> 15:09.023
line up a date for a friend who was coming in I asked 
her if she could line up her roommate. She said,

15:15.112 --> 15:16.254
yes, she could. And that was accomplished. In the 
meantime, she went home. I ended up asking the

15:21.220 --> 15:24.023
roommate out. And since then, we have married 
shortly after that and have had 44 wonderful

15:24.424 --> 15:35.277
years. Her name was... Cecile, but everybody knew 
her as Mickey McCoy from Dalhart, Texas. And

15:45.865 --> 16:02.311
shortly after, while all this was taking place, in 
the meantime, I had been called to active duty in

15:45.865 --> 16:02.311
San Antonio, where TM was a high-ranking civilian 
at Randolph Air Force Base. I was to report to

16:02.932 --> 16:05.115
Lackland Air Force Base. And a few days before I had 
to report in, we were married and moved to San

16:05.770 --> 16:13.881
Antonio. One of the first things I did, of course, 
was contact my cousin, T.M. Moore, and he was

16:21.652 --> 16:31.906
delighted to hear from me and hear all about West 
Texas State and took great pride in being able to

16:21.652 --> 16:31.906
help in any way he could. I told him what was 
available. In the Air Force, of course, he was

16:36.449 --> 16:47.120
familiar with this because he worked for the Air 
Force and was director of curriculum and

16:36.449 --> 16:47.120
materials for the Crew Training Air Force. One of 
the Crew Training Air Force bases was Tyndall Air

16:48.622 --> 16:58.091
Force Base, where they taught trained aircraft 
controllers. I told him about this program, and he

16:59.273 --> 17:03.537
encouraged me to seek it. So I made an application 
and was accepted into that program. And shortly

17:10.250 --> 17:15.217
thereafter, we moved to Florida, Panama City, 
Florida. And I was to go to school at Tyndall Air

17:15.578 --> 17:24.230
Force Base and learn to become an aircraft 
controller. I really didn't know much about what

17:24.250 --> 17:32.241
an aircraft controller did until I got there, but 
found out that they get very bad assignments to

17:32.795 --> 17:49.332
remote sites where they were to try to detect any 
hostile aircraft that might be coming in and

17:32.795 --> 17:49.332
direct our own aircraft to intercept them by the 
use of radar.

17:52.895 --> 18:02.565
The unfortunate part about it was not the 
challenge of the job but the locations that these

17:52.895 --> 18:02.565
radar sites were where they were situated.

18:09.863 --> 18:23.358
Most of the good assignments were overseas, but 
those had been pretty much depleted by the time I

18:09.863 --> 18:23.358
got there, and the assignments that were coming 
through were not good at all. On one of the trips

18:25.019 --> 18:32.788
that my cousin Tillman made to Florida to visit the 
base with the commanding general, We had dinner

18:33.680 --> 18:35.141
together. He asked me how it was going. I explained 
to him my plight. He suggested that the next day I go

18:40.387 --> 18:46.813
over and apply to stay there as an instructor at the 
school. Well, there were no positions as an

18:47.714 --> 18:52.639
instructor at the school and had not been for 
several years. But, lo and behold, when the sign

18:54.180 --> 19:01.948
was came down from my graduating class, there were 
two slots. for instructors there at the school.

19:04.901 --> 19:09.187
Since I was the only one that had applied, I got one 
of those slots. I'm sure that Tillman had the

19:09.207 --> 19:30.940
commanding general place that slot in the school 
since

19:09.207 --> 19:30.940
those had to be assigned by the commanding general 
that Tillman traveled with so much and was very

19:09.207 --> 19:30.940
close to Those were memorable years in many ways. 
We lived on the beach, Mexico Beach, for the first

19:35.052 --> 19:47.786
year and decided that it was a little bit too far 
from everything out there. We were about 15 miles

19:48.487 --> 19:51.010
from Port St. Joe. There was not anything at Port 
St. Joe except a paper mill and a drive-in movie.

19:56.917 --> 20:00.741
And we were about the same distance from Hadamard 
City. We decided we needed to be closer in, so we

20:01.733 --> 20:06.721
moved into Panama City, Florida. The housing on 
the base was impossible to secure, and so we

20:09.226 --> 20:25.834
decided that we could actually live more within 
our means, which was very meager by living in

20:09.226 --> 20:25.834
Panama City in an apartment.

20:30.235 --> 20:33.778
As I said, one of the slots was for the aircraft 
controller school there. And I was serving in that

20:34.239 --> 20:36.521
slot. And after a few months, I was directed to meet 
with Major Horowitz, who was in command of a very

20:36.661 --> 20:55.719
small school called the Ground Observer Corps 
Instructor Training School. This is where

20:56.760 --> 20:58.842
they... trained the plane spotters, civilians 
mostly, to spot any enemy planes that might come

20:59.598 --> 21:08.528
into the United States. And they were observation 
towers throughout the country at that time. The

21:18.258 --> 21:27.748
difference was that this was more of a classroom, a 
lecture situation as opposed to a pupil coach

21:28.083 --> 21:34.031
arrangement that I had been working in as an 
aircraft controller.

21:36.555 --> 21:43.946
This, I thought, was a good experience, a good 
chance, and so when the major offered me the

21:36.555 --> 21:43.946
position, I took it. I immediately started 
teaching such courses as news writing, public

21:49.868 --> 21:59.020
speaking, the threat of the Soviet Union, and 
various subjects that, frankly, I knew very

21:49.868 --> 21:59.020
little about. But as the major said, you can learn 
enough to teach one hour course in that subject.

22:08.331 --> 22:16.922
These were all courses that led to my development 
and background experience that I later use when I

22:17.493 --> 22:20.077
ran for public office. One of the things that I 
learned to do after teaching hundreds of hours of

22:20.678 --> 22:29.091
it over and over again was how to write a news story. 
I had to write a number of news stories and always

22:30.874 --> 22:42.032
wrote my own when I was campaigning

22:30.874 --> 22:42.032
and serving in the legislature.

22:45.505 --> 22:53.575
Without that experience, I'm sure that things 
would have been quite differently over the years.

22:53.595 --> 23:08.172
Upon completion of my two-year stint in the Air 
Force, all of it being either in the aircraft

22:53.595 --> 23:08.172
controller school or the ground observer core 
instructor training program there at Tyndall Air

22:53.595 --> 23:08.172
Force Base, I returned to Brian with the home to

23:08.776 --> 23:19.886
enter graduate school at Texas A&M. At the time, we 
did not have a place to live and the best housing was

23:20.727 --> 23:32.698
some graduate housing that had a long waiting list 
on the south end of the campus. I knew that about the

23:34.659 --> 23:37.602
long waiting list, So I called my cousin, who was 
then a senator, Bob Baker, RW Baker, and asked him

23:38.020 --> 23:48.993
if he could help. And within hours, we had an 
apartment in that graduate housing. We lived

23:57.543 --> 24:02.369
there for two years and had a very memorable 
experience. Our first son had been born, and he

24:07.906 --> 24:18.398
enjoyed his first few years in that graduate 
housing along with some of the friends that we've

24:07.906 --> 24:18.398
made for life while living in that particular 
project. Those houses have since been destroyed.

24:20.781 --> 24:32.314
They were built back in the Depression days and 
provided housing for those kids that otherwise

24:20.781 --> 24:32.314
could not have attended Texas A&M. Later they were 
made into graduate student housing.

24:43.023 --> 24:53.201
In graduate school, I decided that I would 
concentrate on dairy genetics. This is something

24:54.283 --> 24:57.369
that had fascinated me in undergraduate school. 
And I was told that I would need to take more math, so

24:58.731 --> 25:07.647
I went back and took a freshman trigonometry 
course. which I did not get credit for, but it was

25:08.200 --> 25:13.568
something that I needed to do. I should have taken 
both the trigonometry and calculus, but I was

25:14.910 --> 25:32.958
permitted to not take the calculus courses before 
entering some of the programs and courses in

25:14.910 --> 25:32.958
statistics that led to my master's degree. 
Meantime, went through the graduate program as a

25:36.601 --> 25:41.986
graduate assistant. I was a research assistant 
and did my research in heritability of

25:44.107 --> 26:05.646
milk fat and using the herd

25:44.107 --> 26:05.646
records at the Texas prison system in Huntsville.

26:12.125 --> 26:32.611
We had an opportunity to visit the prison system 
several times, interact with prisoners that were

26:12.125 --> 26:32.611
trustees, of course, and some of the more 
interesting experiences and memorable

26:12.125 --> 26:32.611
experiences were some of those visits to the Texas 
prison system. Little did I know that years later I

26:32.631 --> 26:35.194
would be presiding over the budget of the prison 
system. As I was completing my work toward a

26:41.241 --> 27:02.751
master's degree, I began to think about what I 
wanted to do, and my brother-in-law contacted me

26:41.241 --> 27:02.751
and suggested that we come to the Valley and 
consider going into the dairy business with him.

27:03.862 --> 27:12.354
we went to the valley, considered that as a 
possibility, but decided against it for a number

27:03.862 --> 27:12.354
of reasons. But at any rate, we got back home, and my 
father said, if you want a dairy, why don't you take

27:13.135 --> 27:21.787
over the dairy here?

27:24.691 --> 27:32.822
Because he was ready to retire, and he could not 
retire because of the earned income from the dairy

27:24.691 --> 27:32.822
if he maintained ownership. This seemed like a 
logical solution. We liked the area and wanted to

27:38.217 --> 27:54.204
stay here in the Brazos County area, so we decided 
to pursue that and took over the operation of the

27:38.217 --> 27:54.204
dairy while we were still living in graduate 
housing. In the meantime, I was switched over to a

27:54.224 --> 27:58.371
teaching assistantship and taught some 
laboratory courses at Texas A&M during my last

27:58.992 --> 28:05.000
semester here. I had to get out of the graduate 
housing, so we began to build a home on the farm and

28:07.764 --> 28:22.785
completed that home just in time to make the move to 
the country and start operating the dairy.

28:25.168 --> 28:28.493
Shortly after that, we started building a new 
dairy barn one that would not be such a

28:29.165 --> 28:50.276
back-breaking work, and completed that barn and 
began to upgrade the cattle, increase the numbers

28:29.165 --> 28:50.276
to some extent, and try to make it a paying 
proposition.

28:50.296 --> 28:58.648
In the process of all this, about 1962, my

28:50.296 --> 28:58.648
cousin decided that he had served long enough in 
the state senate and decided to run for lieutenant

28:59.101 --> 29:04.186
governor. My oldest brother was his state 
campaign manager. I thought very little of it. Of

29:10.993 --> 29:16.979
course, I was going to help my cousin any way I 
could, but I thought that meant just voting for

29:10.993 --> 29:16.979
him. Shortly after the campaign had hardly begun, 
when I got a call from my brother, saying that he

29:27.434 --> 29:33.301
could not get to Brian and they were having a 
campaign rally or a political rally. Would I

29:33.361 --> 29:47.299
attend and read off some of the material that was in 
the campaign brochures of my cousins and

29:33.361 --> 29:47.299
represent him in that way? I said, sure, I can do 
that. I've had public speaking experience as a

29:49.833 --> 29:57.384
faculty member and as an Air Force instructor. So I 
attended my first political rally as a speaker in

29:58.245 --> 30:10.081
62, and that one was just the beginning. There were 
about 12 or 13 more rallies that were held, and I

30:11.302 --> 30:17.050
ended up attending each one of them. and 
representing my cousin as in his quest for

30:17.738 --> 30:27.271
Lieutenant Governor. There were five people in 
the race. The Speaker of the House was running and

30:32.118 --> 30:36.584
then four state senators. The two that emerged in 
the runoff was the Speaker of the House and State

30:37.665 --> 30:44.775
Senator by the name of Preston Smith. Preston 
Smith went on to win that race and then basically

30:46.105 --> 30:54.677
became governor while I was in the legislature.

30:58.142 --> 31:15.707
They said that was a very close race and one that my 
cousin could have won very easily, but he had a very

30:58.142 --> 31:15.707
productive life in the banking profession, 
primarily years later, so it probably all worked

30:58.142 --> 31:15.707
out for the best.

31:21.138 --> 31:28.185
Shortly after the campaign, I decided that I 
needed to do something other than dairy. And so I

31:30.287 --> 31:38.075
hired some extra help and went to work at Texas A&M 
as a tactical officer. This was in 1962. I was still

31:39.837 --> 31:50.267
dairying, but felt like that I needed some farm 
employment to subsidize the farm operation. The

31:54.024 --> 32:01.192
very next year, the positions were eliminated 
with the exception of three positions. I

32:01.413 --> 32:03.555
maintained one of those three positions. They 
changed our name, changed our title to

32:04.396 --> 32:12.806
counselors, but we were still doing about the same 
thing as we did before. There were just less of us,

32:13.306 --> 32:20.575
and we were supported by military officers in what 
we were doing and working with the Corps of Cadets.

32:21.668 --> 32:36.191
In the meantime, about those early 60s, I became 
the charter president of the Bryan Young Farmers

32:21.668 --> 32:36.191
and later became a state vice president and was on 
the state executive committee. This was a good

32:37.793 --> 32:48.891
experience and led to my being named the runner-up 
outstanding young farmer of Texas by the Texas

32:37.793 --> 32:48.891
JC's in 1966. So there were quite a few accolades 
and honors that helped me in overcoming my shyness

32:50.356 --> 33:04.154
and gave me

32:50.356 --> 33:04.154
some self-esteem. And with the other experiences 
that I had had, when the opportunity presented

33:06.297 --> 33:17.612
itself in 1967,

33:19.010 --> 33:28.861
that the state representative had moved out of the 
area and would not be running for re-election, I

33:19.010 --> 33:28.861
decided to make the race.

33:32.125 --> 33:43.037
I checked on the rules and regulations and 
policies of the Texas A&M University system as I

33:32.125 --> 33:43.037
was employed by A&M. I knew that there would be some 
restrictions. I found that I could not announce

33:45.942 --> 33:55.355
until after I resigned from my position as a 
civilian counselor in the Commandant's office.

33:56.396 --> 34:04.026
So I wanted to wait as long as I could so that I could 
maintain my salaried position. In the meantime,

34:05.789 --> 34:13.519
November 1967, a Madisonville city councilman 
announced that he was going to run for state

34:05.789 --> 34:13.519
representative. And that caused the pressure to 
mount to make some kind of statement. But I held off

34:22.242 --> 34:24.906
until after Christmas. And then in January, I let 
it be known that I would be announcing later in the

34:25.947 --> 34:33.579
month. And that got me around that provision of 
having to resign. And I was able to serve at least

34:41.950 --> 34:44.133
stay on the payroll through January. I did not know 
a lot about serving the state representative, but

34:45.555 --> 34:54.126
my oldest brother had served before and urged me to 
consider it.

34:57.049 --> 35:08.644
He said that it would take very little time, and he 
was right at first, but after you stay a while, it

34:57.049 --> 35:08.644
takes a great deal of time. One of my first contacts 
was with the assistant to the president, and I told

35:12.292 --> 35:26.569
him that what I was thinking about doing, and I felt 
like that I should talk to the president of the A&M

35:12.292 --> 35:26.569
and the other system, Earl Rutter. He set up an 
appointment for me, and I went and interviewed

35:27.731 --> 35:37.102
with Mr. Rutter, told him what my intentions were. 
He suggested I go talk to Buddy Williams, who was

35:37.122 --> 35:41.387
the county Democratic chairman. That had not 
occurred to me, but certainly seemed like a good

35:43.259 --> 35:46.943
idea. But he was somewhat encouraging, and so one 
thing led to another, and I was off and running. It

35:58.174 --> 36:06.782
was a

35:58.174 --> 36:06.782
interesting experience, one that I'll always 
cherish. A lot of hard work and a lot of

36:07.903 --> 36:11.627
organization. And a lot of things that I had 
experienced previously were helpful to me in

36:12.350 --> 36:19.020
getting it done. One thing was all the kinfolks I 
had. Secondly was the good publicity that I'd had

36:23.106 --> 36:32.359
and the good name of the entire family certainly 
helped a great deal.

36:35.624 --> 36:42.053
At that time, the state representative district 
was composed of three counties, Brazos, Grimes,

36:35.624 --> 36:42.053
and Madison counties. I ended up with, as I said, an 
opponent from Madison County. He was a city

36:46.335 --> 36:47.476
councilman. And two others from Brazos County 
were running. One was a student, a Texas A&M, very

36:52.323 --> 36:57.571
active in the young Democrats. And the other was a 
chiropractor. There were no Republicans. These

37:02.538 --> 37:03.679
were all Democrats. In fact, Republicans cast 
less than 200 votes in the primary at that time and

37:04.861 --> 37:11.711
were really not a factor at all. They were very 
seldom feeling anybody at the local level. One of

37:16.975 --> 37:22.464
the things I needed since I lived in the country was 
an office in the Bryan College Station area. I had

37:23.426 --> 37:34.344
the good fortune to contact Dr. Howard Carville, 
who I had known for many years, and he had just

37:23.426 --> 37:34.344
vacated some space on Texas Avenue. And the good 
visible spot with parking in front, and he agreed

37:36.877 --> 37:49.349
to let me have space for my campaign office.

37:49.369 --> 37:58.098
Another big break I had was the bank that I had been 
doing business with for some years had never

37:49.369 --> 37:58.098
gotten involved in political races. The other 
bank was known for its involvement in races and I

38:03.944 --> 38:25.362
had very little contact there, and my opponent in 
Madisonville had excellent connections there,

38:03.944 --> 38:25.362
and I'm sure they were supporting him, although 
they never would say for sure who they were

38:03.944 --> 38:25.362
supporting.

38:25.780 --> 38:34.012
local bank contacted me and said they wanted to be 
active for the first time and that they wanted to

38:25.780 --> 38:34.012
support me. I was elated and began to realize that I 
needed someone to raise a few local bucks, dollars

38:34.572 --> 38:45.628
to make the raise. And when they asked me what they 
could do, I said, do you have anybody that can

38:45.608 --> 38:52.636
service my finance chairman? They said, well, who 
do you want? I told them I'd like to have their vice

38:53.857 --> 38:57.381
president, and they said fine. The competing bank 
was not happy with this at all and suggested I had

38:58.642 --> 39:07.371
made a terrible mistake in involving that bank. I 
remember in my dilemma as to what to do, I called on

39:12.440 --> 39:21.654
the state senator at that time, Bill Moore, and his 
advice in so many words was take any help you can

39:12.440 --> 39:21.654
get. I remember the bank vice president kept all 
donations at $100, said no one can give more than

39:21.674 --> 39:30.868
$100. Of course, not many people in this area were 
going to give more than $100 anyway, so that was not

39:31.008 --> 39:38.920
a real problem.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.388
I visited with my cousin in Houston. He put me in 
contact with some people that provided some good

39:42.548 --> 39:52.161
advice and good contacts, and I'm sure some little 
financial support as time went on. In addition to

39:54.384 --> 40:01.853
that, I remember one of the advices that a lobbyist 
gave me in Houston was he had been defeated as state

40:02.913 --> 40:15.087
representative, and he said the reason he was 
defeated is that he had not worked his strengths,

40:02.913 --> 40:15.087
that he was weak in one part of his senatorial or 
representative district. He had spent too much

40:15.107 --> 40:18.371
time there instead of working where he was strong. 
And I remembered that and tried to

40:19.392 --> 40:30.304
include that thinking into my plans as the 
campaign moved along. Some other fortunate

40:32.073 --> 40:48.718
breaks I had, I had a neighbor who was in the labor 
movement, and he offered to help even though he

40:32.073 --> 40:48.718
knew that I would be rather conservative, more 
conservative than the labor unions would prefer.

40:49.939 --> 41:01.236
But he helped introduce me to some of the minority 
leadership, both in the black community and the

40:49.939 --> 41:01.236
Hispanic community, and the fact that he was 
supporting me influenced them to support me as

41:01.891 --> 41:06.204
well. In addition to that, my father was well known 
in the black community because many of those had

41:08.231 --> 41:15.192
been sharecroppers that we talked about earlier. 
And my father had always been quite generous and

41:15.847 --> 41:25.155
understanding in dealing with these people. And 
the children, many of them were then just young

41:25.336 --> 41:34.424
people that were living out there on my 
grandfather's farm. But they remembered the

41:36.606 --> 41:43.272
kindnesses that my father had shown, and that 
certainly was an influence.

41:46.120 --> 41:50.988
So we got good support from the minorities, even 
though we did not carry those areas. We did not get

41:51.028 --> 42:00.624
swamped or overwhelmed by the young Democrat who 
was running in that part of town. He espoused a

42:00.664 --> 42:08.938
liberal philosophy and thought he was going to 
carry those minority boxes heavily, but it turned

42:00.664 --> 42:08.938
out that he either did not carry them at all or 
carried them by a very slim margin, and I'm sure

42:09.577 --> 42:17.250
that was a factor. Another factor in that first 
race was that Grimes County was in the district and

42:17.270 --> 42:30.192
was heavily involved in the dairy industry. There 
were probably 150 to 175 dairies at the time, And

42:35.632 --> 42:40.300
the dairy industry people were very close, and I 
was one of them. And that gave me some good

42:41.522 --> 42:47.593
contacts, gave me a good inroad with those people. 
And as a result of that and working Brazos County

42:48.635 --> 43:00.255
and doing just a token amount of work in Madison 
County, remembering what This lobbyist had told

43:00.590 --> 43:11.766
me don't quirk your weaknesses, and certainly 
Madison County would be a weakness because I was

43:00.590 --> 43:11.766
running against a fair-haired boy from Madison 
County. I was almost won without a runoff. I needed

43:17.414 --> 43:22.501
67 votes to avoid a runoff. This was the only runoff 
I ever had three weeks later. And it meant that we

43:27.488 --> 43:35.660
had to spend some more money and time in securing 
that race. The race incident cost about $4,000. We

43:40.486 --> 43:42.950
paid off all of it without going into debt. But in 
the process, I had to use about $1,600 that I had

43:43.751 --> 43:52.804
accumulated toward my retirement at Texas A&M. I 
had withdrawn those funds and spent them on the

43:53.071 --> 43:57.595
race.

44:00.678 --> 44:05.042
After the primary was over, I really wanted to get 
back to work if I could. So I called a friend of mine

44:05.202 --> 44:09.626
here and said, can I get my old job back? I don't 
remember when the election actually is. He

44:12.548 --> 44:15.771
checked out the law and said yes, that I could. And 
so I immediately reported back to work in the

44:15.831 --> 44:22.437
commandant's office. After being employed there 
three days, I got a call that President Rutter

44:23.024 --> 44:30.915
wanted to see me. I went to his office, and he 
suggested that I would be kind of wasting my time

44:32.878 --> 44:48.441
down there, that he would refer that like for me to 
move to the budget office and learn all about the

44:32.878 --> 44:48.441
budgets of the A&M system. and that in the process 
he would like to get me off of the state payroll and

44:49.417 --> 44:55.526
put me on a private payroll. This was fine with me as 
long as I got paid. And so the next few months I sat

45:00.073 --> 45:13.714
through the budget reviews and preparation for 
the legislative session and had a firsthand view

45:00.073 --> 45:13.714
of how the process works. Mr. Rudder was unusual 
person. He was most thoughtful leader I have ever

45:21.392 --> 45:29.301
been around and had a tremendous ability to lead. 
And he taught me something about decision making

45:30.883 --> 45:36.509
that I will always carry with me. And I had to learn 
to admire his integrity and his ability to lead

45:37.871 --> 45:48.904
during those few months that I spent in his office 
as we reviewed the budgets.

45:53.457 --> 45:59.924
Finally, we had the opportunity to meet a few 
members of the legislature, but not that many. I

46:00.865 --> 46:09.374
remember one of the first ones that I saw had just 
been elected as lieutenant governor. His name was

46:09.394 --> 46:10.695
Ben Barnes. And when I saw him, we were standing 
face to face just so suddenly that I stuck out my

46:11.997 --> 46:21.827
hand and I said, I'm Ben Barnes. And I'm sure he got a 
chuckle out of that. But him being magnanimous, as

46:25.500 --> 46:42.373
he always was and is, called me by name, by first 
name, and said he was glad that I would be in the

46:25.500 --> 46:42.373
legislature and had looked forward to meeting 
you. And we appreciated that. One of the things

46:44.993 --> 46:57.985
that always helped was the congressional name was 
well known because my brother had been lobbying in

46:44.993 --> 46:57.985
the halls of the Capitol for almost 30 years, or 20 
years, excuse me, 20 years. And as a result, the

46:58.005 --> 47:02.496
name was well known and well respected. The people 
that my brother had served with, of course, had all

47:03.607 --> 47:18.858
moved on by the time I got to the legislature 
because we followed each other by, I followed him

47:03.607 --> 47:18.858
by for some 20 years.

47:18.878 --> 47:21.383
This is the end of Chapter 3. I will begin Chapter 4 
on the next stage.
