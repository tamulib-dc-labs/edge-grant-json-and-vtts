WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:12.780
So we were talking about there was some diversity 
and some reasonable respect for that diversity.

00:12.980 --> 00:26.154
In my class,

00:12.980 --> 00:26.154
in my freshman group, we had a couple of Jewish 
guys. We had three. at least three Hispanics.

00:36.639 --> 00:46.334
And I may be the wrong one to comment on this, but 
they probably suffered more discrimination than

00:36.639 --> 00:46.334
I knew. But from my standpoint, those people were 
all accepted on the basis of their abilities and

00:46.354 --> 00:56.930
not on the basis of what they were or what they 
weren't. And in my class, By the time we were

01:01.051 --> 01:10.380
seniors, the Corps Commander was Hispanic and 
still a very good friend of mine. Was Hector? Oh, I

01:12.302 --> 01:13.723
know Hector well. And Hector was Corps Commander 
not because they thought it was time for a Hispanic

01:14.324 --> 01:21.230
Corps Commander, but because he was the best. And 
he'd earned it. And nobody would disagree. So... I

01:30.532 --> 01:45.952
think that's one of the things I always have 
treasured about the way A&M was at that time was

01:30.532 --> 01:45.952
that uniform at the core was a great leveling 
factor. And it didn't matter what somebody, what

01:45.972 --> 01:53.281
they dressed like when they came or how much money 
they had or anything at all like that. It was a

01:53.301 --> 01:58.007
matter of what you could accomplish and what was 
inside you. Sort of the American ideal. What were

02:01.835 --> 02:10.606
some of the prestigious student activity 
organizations when you were an undergraduate?

02:10.626 --> 02:11.947
Ah, boy. Bands, singing cadets, et cetera.

02:16.453 --> 02:20.938
Well, the band was

02:16.453 --> 02:20.938
large. Obviously, everybody had great pride. 
Everybody kidded the band, band queers, all that

02:24.498 --> 02:31.930
sort of thing, but everybody had great pride in the 
band and how good it was. Ross Volunteers was an

02:34.133 --> 02:38.660
outstanding organization at the Corps.

02:41.805 --> 02:46.793
Singing Cadets, even now, I think the Singing 
Cadets probably aren't appreciated as much by the

02:46.958 --> 02:59.738
students as they probably should be because it 
takes so much time and so much talent to be in that.

02:59.758 --> 03:15.042
There are a lot of other student activities, the 
student government things, MSC, a lot of those

02:59.758 --> 03:15.042
different types of organizations, and that 
established, in my mind, what is the importance of

03:15.562 --> 03:40.422
education is more than just a classroom because 
there were so many things down there where

03:15.562 --> 03:40.422
students could be involved and learn skills that 
were probably of greater value in the real world in

03:15.562 --> 03:40.422
the business marketplace than what they might 
learn in the classroom so I've been a very strong

03:15.562 --> 03:40.422
advocate of those types of things which if you 
could have been had your choice of any of those

03:40.604 --> 03:51.443
student leadership roles, which ones do you think 
had the highest prestige to be the number one

03:40.604 --> 03:51.443
person of what, what, what?

03:55.690 --> 04:00.739
Well, I don't know that I've ever tried to rank 
those.

04:02.812 --> 04:16.516
Being the president of the student body, the 
president of the student senate at that time,

04:02.812 --> 04:16.516
probably was more time consuming and immediately 
probably had more prestige with the students in

04:02.812 --> 04:16.516
some circles. In many, it probably didn't. Most of 
the people who were active in that were regarded as

04:19.321 --> 04:22.706
politicians. And if ever there's been a place 
where there's probably disdain for student

04:22.746 --> 04:28.296
politicians, it's A&M. The Yale leaders were 
involved in a lot of things, and that was a

04:28.799 --> 04:33.866
prestigious thing. Being the corps commander was 
very, very prestigious, I think.

04:43.060 --> 04:46.465
I don't know if there's any one of those that I would 
think would have been . Were there any of those

04:46.685 --> 04:57.321
organizations, other than the corps commander 
and, say, the bands, were there any that you all

04:46.685 --> 04:57.321
thought always should go to a corps member?

05:01.891 --> 05:08.523
MSC Council, class president, student body 
president? I think we probably would have been

05:09.926 --> 05:12.791
more inclined to think student body president. 
But see, even then, There was a fellow who was a good

05:16.589 --> 05:28.401
friend of mine, civilian student, who was very 
involved in the MSC and may have been very involved

05:16.589 --> 05:28.401
in the student senate who was a civilian student. 
There were and have previously been civilian

05:28.501 --> 05:33.447
student yell leaders. I don't think that, I think 
the culture at that time, my sense is that the

05:35.469 --> 05:41.635
culture was not was not that we need to make sure we 
have someone in the corps as the head of this, but

05:43.117 --> 05:50.206
because it was just sort of assumed that that would 
be. I don't think there was a sense of

05:50.226 --> 05:52.630
preservation. It was assumed that the head would 
always be somebody in the corps. It was more like,

05:56.294 --> 05:59.238
can we let a civilian student be involved? Well, 
sure. It's a little different orientation, if you

05:59.719 --> 06:02.863
get my drift. Okay, one of the interesting little 
items that I have learned to ask about, can you

06:03.333 --> 06:14.251
share anything that you've ever heard about any 
secret fraternities? No. You don't know of any?

06:19.039 --> 06:20.963
You know, I don't.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.290
I had that discussion kind of... three or four 
years ago. I was told that there were some secret

06:27.719 --> 06:39.518
fraternities in the Corps that had been uncovered 
now that they supposedly went back to when I was in

06:27.719 --> 06:39.518
school. I didn't know about it. I never heard about 
it as a faculty member for 21 years. Some of these

06:45.628 --> 06:48.392
people I've talked to, 30s and 40s, say yes. They 
believe there was the TTs. And another one, the

06:50.836 --> 06:53.100
stickers. As in swastika. Well, I'll tell you if 
you want to stop that. Let's see.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.500
Project houses. You didn't have any interaction 
with anybody that lived over in the project

07:08.400 --> 07:12.825
houses? Well, except to the extent that that was 
usually married students. And, of course, you'd

07:17.069 --> 07:19.111
have some in your classes. But, no, I don't 
remember if I ever even went in one of them. Let's

07:24.113 --> 07:25.995
see. Let's talk about football weekend. Describe 
a typical home game football weekend in College

07:29.899 --> 07:34.804
Station. What happened on Friday and Saturday?

07:39.489 --> 07:49.319
OK. Friday night, you have midnight y'all 
practice. Friday afternoons. you either knew

07:52.379 --> 08:03.291
that maybe your parents or friends or maybe if you 
were lucky enough to have a date, you'd be getting

07:52.379 --> 08:03.291
ready for that somehow. Usually your outfit would 
have some sort of activity like they'd want to

08:04.452 --> 08:13.041
clean up everything or clean up your room, 
whatever it would be. Saturdays,

08:14.122 --> 08:19.568
if the game was in the afternoon, you'd have the 
Describe the yoke practice. Where was it? Oh,

08:22.421 --> 08:23.422
midnight yoke practice. Yeah. Where was it? What 
happened? Make believe I've never been to one.

08:29.890 --> 08:32.033
Well, OK. Let me see if I can remember now. Midnight 
yoke practice would start in the core area. The

08:37.380 --> 08:38.181
band would lead it. Everybody would follow behind 
the band. It was sort of like an organized riot.

08:47.543 --> 09:04.707
Of course, not too surprising, a lot of the people 
had been drinking or whatever, although I don't, I

08:47.543 --> 09:04.707
may be wrong, but I don't remember ever seeing 
people carrying liquor bottles with them at the

08:47.543 --> 09:04.707
time because it was, that was a pretty well 
enforced rule. But there might have been people

09:06.029 --> 09:08.072
who'd been out drinking before that. And then it 
would wind around campus, That's incorrect.

09:16.725 --> 09:28.457
Leave the core area and march down past where the 
coldness building is now and go into the stadium.

09:28.477 --> 09:34.083
And the midnight yoke practice was held in the 
stadium. And my recollection is that it was...

09:35.865 --> 09:40.830
Yeah, that's... Okay. Whitley.

09:47.922 --> 09:50.125
We were talking about yell practice. Now what 
were, you got into the stadium, and then what

09:51.346 --> 09:58.756
events occur in the stadium as a part of yell 
practice? Well, the idea was built around the

09:59.116 --> 10:04.022
regular yell practice. You had the same formats. 
And now I think they use microphones. I don't

10:09.409 --> 10:10.791
remember. in those days whether they used 
microphones they may have but i don't remember it

10:11.176 --> 10:27.345
wasn't necessary because everything was done by 
signals and all that but the uh it was extended it

10:11.176 --> 10:27.345
was longer than a regular yell practice the The 
yell leaders would tell stories, jokes, fables,

10:28.928 --> 10:39.302
usually about making fun of the other team that we 
were playing, or a lot of times about girls. That

10:40.604 --> 10:47.834
was always a popular source of jokes at that time, 
because there weren't many girls around.

10:47.894 --> 10:51.880
There'd be the band would play. There may be more to 
it. I don't care. And it would end at about what

10:56.967 --> 10:58.429
time? I think probably about 1 o'clock, something 
like that. OK, now let's go to Saturday. What

11:02.961 --> 11:05.126
happened on Saturdays or home games? Well, let's 
see.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.363
I don't ever remember. With certain exceptions, I 
don't ever remember having a Saturday formation

11:13.900 --> 11:20.437
or doing anything with the Corps. But you'd have to 
have your room ready for inspection. If you'd have

11:23.645 --> 11:30.863
people coming up, parents or friends or whatever, 
If the game was, if it was an afternoon game, we had a

11:31.130 --> 11:49.075
lot of night games in those days, if it was an 
afternoon game, you'd have to be ready by about 11

11:31.130 --> 11:49.075
o'clock, I would think, for a two o'clock game, 
because they'd have the Corps march into the

11:31.130 --> 11:49.075
stadium. And of course, that was always graded, so 
you'd have an inspection, they'd have you think

11:49.095 --> 12:00.310
that the future of the free world depended upon 
that, and then you'd march to the stadium, march

12:01.387 --> 12:10.437
around the track, then you'd go off, be dismissed 
following that, and you'd go sit in the stadium. I

12:10.457 --> 12:13.961
think now they go back to the dorms and change 
clothes or something like that. We didn't do that.

12:14.602 --> 12:15.903
We'd go straight to the stadium. All right, now if 
you had a date for the game, you parted company with

12:15.923 --> 12:22.670
her where? Usually at the dorm. And you'd give her 
your tickets. And then you'd meet her after the

12:29.112 --> 12:33.839
march in up there. That was one reason it was a 
little bit more fun, if I remember, to have dates

12:34.620 --> 12:43.894
who knew each other. So several of you could sit 
together and the dates would know each other. That

12:47.139 --> 12:49.242
made it a little bit more fun. Describe a court 
trip. A court

12:52.607 --> 12:56.993
trip. In those days, there was either one trip a 
year to Fort Worth or Dallas and one to Houston or

12:57.563 --> 13:04.722
Austin. And so there was really two here, and 
everybody would go find a place to stay

13:05.461 --> 13:13.316
frequently. You'd have 17 guys at your house if you 
were from this area. A lot of play, there'd be core

13:18.065 --> 13:21.953
parties if you wanted to go to those. A lot of guys 
would use that as an excuse to just go get drunk. But

13:26.762 --> 13:28.465
then on Saturday morning, Right early, you had to 
be in either, wherever you were in that downtown

13:29.879 --> 13:37.191
area and be ready to march. And then you'd march in a 
parade in the downtown of whatever one of those

13:38.433 --> 13:43.201
four cities. Here in Fort Worth, where did y'all 
gather and where did you march? In Fort Worth, we

13:48.008 --> 13:53.237
would gather actually about three blocks from 
where we're sitting. Downtown area, right down

13:53.257 --> 13:56.342
here off Main Street. They changed the parade 
route several times, but basically you'd march

13:57.773 --> 14:08.507
through the downtown area to one end from the north 
end of downtown to the south and then back up, and it

13:57.773 --> 14:08.507
was a pretty good hike. Fort Worth was a better 
place to do a parade than a lot of other places. In

14:13.574 --> 14:16.338
Austin, you'd march right down Congress Avenue. 
In Houston, I don't remember where we were. I

14:18.321 --> 14:19.282
presume Main Street. I think so, but I don't 
remember enough about it. In Dallas, was it

14:21.645 --> 14:23.467
Commerce? I think probably down Commerce Street. 
How did the onlookers on the sidewalks react to a

14:25.904 --> 14:31.354
bunch of Aggies marching by? When you asked that 
question, my mind immediately thought, did we

14:33.799 --> 14:39.971
ever encounter any hostility? I don't remember 
anything. I think it was always parents, friends,

14:44.872 --> 14:47.234
Former students, people who bring their kids. I 
used to, gosh, for years after I got out of school,

14:48.315 --> 14:57.004
every time A&M would be, the Corps would be here, 
I'd take my kids down to see them march. It's just

14:57.604 --> 14:58.886
always great. Always a lot of fun. What were some of 
your favorite football game memories? Do you

15:04.371 --> 15:06.433
remember any games that were really special? 
Sure.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.638
I remember the... for various things, for various 
reasons. I remember, of course, we beat Texas in

15:16.128 --> 15:19.955
1967. That meant that we won the conference and 
went to the Cotton Hole. That was a great football

15:27.548 --> 15:29.331
game. I remember when I was a freshman or 
sophomore, I think it was freshman, we played

15:30.012 --> 15:38.807
Florida State in College Station. I don't even 
remember if we won the game or not, but I remember it

15:40.205 --> 15:45.562
rained the whole game. And we stood in that thing, 
and it was the wettest game. I've gone to a few games

15:50.110 --> 16:01.642
since then that were pretty wet, but I'll never, 
that Colorado State game was the top, just

15:50.110 --> 16:01.642
everything was wet. I remember we played SMU one 
time in the first part of the 1967 season and lost to

16:02.703 --> 16:12.572
them right at the end of the game, three or four 
seconds left. We thought we were gonna have a good

16:12.593 --> 16:17.097
team, and we ended up losing that game too. I 
remember coming up here to TCU one year, the year

16:17.515 --> 16:35.071
that we won the conference, and a guy intercepted a 
pass in the end zone by Billy Hobbs for an

16:17.515 --> 16:35.071
intercepted pass and ran it back like 102 yards or 
something for a touchdown. Yeah, they were a lot of

16:35.091 --> 16:37.553
good games.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.319
Final review for you. Do you have any memories of 
that being a special?

16:49.477 --> 16:50.358
Yeah, I guess so.

16:55.405 --> 17:01.894
Of course, it's always special when you're a 
freshman, because that's interesting. Compare

17:02.775 --> 17:05.419
those two, freshman and senior. Yeah, I was just 
about to say, I've never thought about that until

17:05.479 --> 17:08.423
you asked. But the same event can mean so many 
different things to so many different people.

17:13.962 --> 17:19.449
After your freshman year, it's great because it 
means that you finally survived. And that doesn't

17:20.069 --> 17:24.375
just mean physical survival. It means you prove 
something to yourself that you've at least made it

17:24.435 --> 17:34.547
so many times when you might question whether you 
would. And then

17:34.567 --> 17:41.455
your senior year, well, it really means that this 
is over. And this is a, you really got to do

17:41.958 --> 17:45.624
something now. And, you know, the factor about 
this is the last time I'll see most of these guys.

17:52.776 --> 17:55.040
And at that time there was a war going on. And so you 
weren't sure exactly what that was, what was going

17:55.060 --> 17:58.526
to happen with that. Did any, did members of your 
family, any special people there? Oh yeah, my

18:05.870 --> 18:09.894
parents would have been there. I don't remember if 
they were there at the final review for my freshman

18:10.034 --> 18:13.397
year. I don't think they were, but I know my senior 
year they would have been. That was the same day I

18:16.861 --> 18:20.244
graduated and got commissioned. I graduated in 
four years.

18:24.368 --> 18:25.229
They were there for that. That's just one of those 
things that you remember. What made commencement

18:29.874 --> 18:32.316
special? Just the fact that I was graduating. Do 
you remember who the speaker was? No, I don't. I

18:40.258 --> 18:41.219
don't. I've tried to think about that. And I bet if I 
went back and looked at my yearbook or really made

18:42.461 --> 18:47.207
some effort, I could find it. And it's probably 
somebody that I would remember. I do remember, and

18:49.770 --> 18:56.498
I tried to remember this the year I was president of 
the association. I remember walking across the

18:57.254 --> 19:01.883
stage, and I'm glad to see A&M still does these. I 
remember walking across the stage, and President

19:01.903 --> 19:15.870
Rudder shook my hand, and then I'm walking towards 
the end, and I can still remember that Mr.

19:01.903 --> 19:15.870
Peterson, Pete Peterson was fourth, and I knew him 
a little bit. And he was, I think, probably

19:15.850 --> 19:19.234
chairman of the Board of Regents at that time. And 
Mr. Peterson came up and shook my hand. And that

19:22.338 --> 19:26.363
meant a lot to me when you see somebody you know 
doing that. So I tried to remember when I was

19:26.403 --> 19:34.372
president of the association, if I'd see anybody 
that I knew or knew somebody in their family, I'd

19:26.403 --> 19:34.372
speak to them. But yeah, that was a, in fact, you 
know, I think kids now graduating, there's a

19:34.432 --> 19:42.482
little bit of a sense that they're in the, They hate 
to leave because College Station was kind of a

19:43.390 --> 19:47.575
cocoon. In those days, I wanted to get out. I wanted 
to go on. I don't know, I liked it, but I was ready for

19:53.822 --> 19:57.946
it to be over. What kind of a world, you said there 
was a war going on, what kind of a world did you think

19:57.966 --> 20:03.352
you were about to enter? What was ahead of you as far 
as you could tell at that point? I didn't know. I've

20:09.039 --> 20:13.043
always maintained

20:14.677 --> 20:27.131
Until about April,

20:14.677 --> 20:27.131
well, until about 60 days or so before I graduated, 
I wasn't sure what I was going to be doing. And

20:27.151 --> 20:31.496
frankly, what happened was I knew I was going to be 
commissioned. And in those days, it was so

20:32.478 --> 20:35.661
different than it is now. I had a friend who 
suggested, in fact, this is a true story. It's

20:42.609 --> 20:44.211
probably more than you want to know. There were 
three or four of us that were talking about going to

20:45.052 --> 20:51.018
law school. And this friend of mine was really the 
one who was pushing it. And I figured, well, I'm

20:54.161 --> 20:57.724
going to end up in Vietnam. And he said one time, 
well, let's go to Austin and see what it takes to get

20:57.744 --> 21:02.769
into law school. Now, this is dumb. And here we 
were, seniors about to graduate, and didn't know

21:04.431 --> 21:09.296
what it took to get in. But I figured, I'm going to go 
to the Army. Well, three of us went over there. One

21:15.745 --> 21:18.431
of them was Bill Mayholms, the black guy. So I mean, 
this almost sounds like a joke. There were two

21:20.676 --> 21:24.926
white guys and a black guy from A&M going to law 
school. And we literally went over there to the

21:24.946 --> 21:32.743
dean of admissions office and said, we'd like to 
find out what it takes to get in law school. And I

21:33.162 --> 21:35.424
thought it was going to be some long process. He 
said, well, it's simple. Tell me your grades. Tell

21:37.547 --> 21:38.888
me your LSAT score. Well, I've taken that because I 
knew you had to take it and I had that. He said,

21:43.113 --> 21:44.194
that's simple. That's all. All you got to tell me. 
And so the three of us went around the room and told

21:47.398 --> 21:51.162
him. And it literally was the case where I had the 
best grades and the best essay possible. And he

21:58.510 --> 21:59.811
told me, he says, you're in. You apply, you're 
admitted. Wow, I'm lying. And the guy who'd really

22:05.666 --> 22:09.570
been the one pushing us was borderline. He said, I 
don't know. You're close. And Bill, the black guy,

22:13.093 --> 22:18.439
had lower grades, lower law school tests. And he 
said, well, by your grades, you shouldn't get in.

22:21.402 --> 22:24.846
But I'd like to talk with you some more. So our 
friend who commissioned us to go over there on the

22:24.866 --> 22:30.051
way back said, well, I can see what's going to 
happen. Creel's in, Mayholmes is in, and he says,

22:30.723 --> 22:35.795
Bill's gonna end up going to the University of 
Houston. That's exactly what happened. And all of

22:38.000 --> 22:43.011
us went on to law school, and all of us have done 
fairly well. On that drive back,

22:43.497 --> 22:57.035
the one thing that it made me really think 
seriously about going to law school and pursue it

22:43.497 --> 22:57.035
some was that I'd also gone at my friend's behest. 
The University of Texas had sent some people over

22:58.257 --> 23:06.248
to A&M to talk with students who were interested in 
studying law school to talk about it. And I still

23:06.268 --> 23:09.572
remember that the guy they sent over very young 
professor at the University of Texas named

23:09.873 --> 23:14.641
Stanley Johansen. And Stanley is one of my 
favorite law school professors and just one of the

23:14.661 --> 23:19.689
most remarkable people. And I remember thinking, 
this guy is sensational. And he made it sound

23:24.517 --> 23:26.220
interesting. And then probably a couple of months 
later, we go over there, and the guy says, you're in

23:26.240 --> 23:31.449
if you want to go. And so I remember thinking on the 
way back, hey, I'm going to apply. I'm going to go

23:36.625 --> 23:39.409
over there because I can go there. And frankly, my 
thought was maybe by the time I'm through there,

23:39.449 --> 23:45.538
this war will be over with and I won't have to go to 
Vietnam. So that's what happened. And so I was

23:48.382 --> 23:52.367
eager to go to law school. And I've often told 
people, I'm surprised no one's done the study of

23:52.387 --> 23:55.953
this. I don't think that anybody could study the 
late 60s without realizing The total cultural

24:03.552 --> 24:16.132
divide that existed at that time between Austin 
and College Station, it was the total difference

24:03.552 --> 24:16.132
in cultures between those two places. In June of 
1969, I was in College Station. In September of

24:22.001 --> 24:26.708
1969, I was resigning in Austin and was likely 
living in a foreign country. Did you and your

24:27.295 --> 24:35.767
classmates, fellow students, hear any reports of 
what had happened to Aggies in Vietnam? Sure,

24:36.228 --> 24:38.792
sure. There was a guy who was a junior in my outfit 
when I was a freshman. By the time I was a senior,

24:44.340 --> 24:46.603
he'd been killed. And so we do some things about 
that. We hear reports about that. Did you go to any

24:53.144 --> 24:55.667
on-campus musters? Sure. Where were they held? I 
don't remember any of them being inside G. Raleigh

24:59.551 --> 25:09.243
as they are now, but I can remember going to them 
right in front of the Systems Administration

24:59.551 --> 25:09.243
building. And I think that may be where all of them 
were. But I can remember that, so I don't remember

25:13.634 --> 25:18.704
going to any of it any other way. Did those events 
make any emotional impression on you? To some

25:22.692 --> 25:27.441
extent, yeah.

25:29.345 --> 25:34.015
I don't think that made as much emotional 
impression on me as Silver Taps did. I was going to

25:34.035 --> 25:36.179
ask you to describe Silver Taps. Silver Taps 
occurred in front, actually now to the west of the

25:36.379 --> 25:44.256
academic building, right in front of the Saul Ross 
statue. That made an emotional impression on me

25:45.318 --> 25:48.805
because it was... It occurred at night. There was 
no lights around campus. And the only sound you

25:53.390 --> 26:00.139
could hear was the Ross Volunteers, the firing 
squad, the Ross Volunteers marching. And you

26:00.159 --> 26:03.303
could hear them for blocks away. And they'd come 
and they'd fire taps. Or they'd come and they'd

26:07.048 --> 26:08.730
fire volley. And then there were a butler that 
played taps, probably two or three butlers that

26:09.051 --> 26:13.676
played taps. And where were the vehicles?

26:17.489 --> 26:18.811
You know, I'm not sure. I think they were up, I think 
they were probably up on the steps of the academic

26:18.831 --> 26:27.086
building, but I never identified exactly where. 
But that's the place I think they must have been. As

26:30.812 --> 26:38.345
you all left Silver Taps, what was your follow-up 
attitude and behavior pattern immediately

26:30.812 --> 26:38.345
after? Silence. nobody spoke a word, and 
technically you were supposed to have lights out

26:40.287 --> 26:46.995
all over the campus. If you went back and you had to 
study, you were advised to put a blanket or

26:48.116 --> 26:56.966
something up over your window so there wouldn't 
be, it was like a blackout. But that made more of an

26:58.068 --> 27:02.753
impression on me probably at that age than 
mustering it. Right, now let's go to the other

27:02.773 --> 27:04.355
extreme. Where, say on a Saturday night, If a group 
of Aggies wanted to go have a good time, cut up,

27:08.418 --> 27:16.771
where did people go to kick over the traces?

27:19.835 --> 27:20.757
Well, let's see. If you were in College Station, 
there were places that you could go to. There was

27:30.305 --> 27:34.110
some dancing places, I think. I don't remember if I 
ever went to one or two of those. There were some

27:37.335 --> 27:40.659
pizza places around that you could go and drink 
beer and eat pizza.

27:43.804 --> 27:45.306
Not nearly as many places there were. Was 
Appalachian still going? No. Hard liquor? No.

27:48.070 --> 27:49.211
Whiskey Bridge? Whiskey Bridge. You could go out 
and buy liquor if you wanted to out west of the

27:49.932 --> 27:58.945
county line, out by the river.

28:02.823 --> 28:05.287
Boy, I don't remember. You can drive into Bryan, go 
to the movie, or there were some places around. If

28:11.996 --> 28:18.085
you had a special person, either girlfriend or 
family, where would you have taken them? We're

28:20.268 --> 28:22.431
talking about a positive now, a special. Sure, 
sure. Well, if you wanted to go someplace to eat,

28:30.025 --> 28:31.948
There was a place, I can't remember the name of it. 
It was out on that road toward Whiskey Bridge. It

28:34.291 --> 28:35.513
was a steak place. They had big old steaks. I can't 
remember the name of that. And there were a few

28:38.618 --> 28:40.841
other places. You were out of luck if you didn't 
like chicken fried steak. That was about mainly

28:44.166 --> 28:46.350
what they had. There were a couple of little 
Mexican food places around. There weren't too

28:50.816 --> 28:55.704
many really, not hardly any really nice places I 
can think of. Let's see. Was Pinky still there?

28:57.927 --> 28:58.648
Pinky Downs? Pinky was there. Maybe Pinky may have 
died while I was in school, but I can still remember

29:00.888 --> 29:06.755
Pinky walking around. I'd go just about every 
morning, I'd go to the MSC. They had a reading room

29:11.000 --> 29:12.322
down there. I could find the local Fort Worth paper 
or something. I'd read that, and I can still

29:15.626 --> 29:19.951
remember Pinky hanging out around there, and he'd 
talk to you. Did you ever meet old Army Lou? Oh,

29:23.696 --> 29:24.597
sure, sure. What made him special?

29:28.565 --> 29:42.408
I think that Lupo was special to, I think that for 
most people who were just buying books, there was

29:28.565 --> 29:42.408
the old saying about you're not a true Aggie until 
you've been screwed by a Lou. That's what some

29:42.448 --> 29:43.530
people used to say. It was just a place to buy books 
and he'd always have a line of gab he'd want to talk

29:44.472 --> 29:49.881
to you. give you a dollar for friendship or 
something like that. But I've heard too many

29:52.583 --> 29:57.750
stories about Aggies who were kind of down on their 
luck. And I think that's where he really

29:57.770 --> 30:04.280
ingratiated himself was there were a lot of Aggies 
who needed some money or this or that. And he really

30:04.300 --> 30:05.822
helped a lot of those guys. And so I think that's 
where his real legend grew was for helping people.

30:10.488 --> 30:12.611
All right. We're talking about indulgences now. 
Aggies smoked. What were they smoking?

30:21.282 --> 30:27.149
Winston's,

30:21.282 --> 30:27.149
Marlboro's, I guess. Did you ever hear any, when 
you were a student, did you ever hear any hint of

30:27.169 --> 30:35.880
anybody smoking anything other than tobacco? 
God, no. No. I don't think any of us knew there was

30:39.044 --> 30:42.508
anything else to smoke. And if they were drinking, 
they were drinking what? Well,

30:44.871 --> 30:49.517
beer. liquor, whiskey, just whatever your 
pleasure was, whatever your personal preference

30:50.510 --> 30:57.077
was. And did anybody chew or dip? There was some of 
that, yeah. The guys who were, you know, mainly the

31:02.884 --> 31:10.632
guys who'd grown up in West Texas on ranches or 
whatever, yeah, there were some guys who did that.

31:11.593 --> 31:17.340
All right, I have never heard any reports of houses 
of ill repute, prostitution. In Bryan College

31:18.121 --> 31:19.182
Station? Yeah. No, there was always a place in 
LaGrange. I never went there, but there were guys I

31:22.752 --> 31:26.307
knew who did go there. The chicken ranch was there? 
Yeah, yeah.
