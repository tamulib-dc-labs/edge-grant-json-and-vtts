00:03.524 --> 00:09.512
What do you think was the role of NASA in bringing 
planetary astronomy back from the dead? Well, I

00:11.114 --> 00:23.330
think NASA is essentially the mother of modern 
planetary astronomy slash planetary science.

00:23.350 --> 00:26.494
And I believe this story as accurately. and well 
told in Joe Tatarevich's book on the subject. I've

00:30.407 --> 00:48.006
read that, and I think he makes a very convincing 
case that we modern NASA or modern planetary

00:30.407 --> 00:48.006
scientists really owe the formation of this 
entire discipline in its present state to the

00:30.407 --> 00:48.006
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
We also owe NASA our current degree of extreme

00:48.767 --> 00:53.072
frustration in the difficulty that we have in 
doing our business, in promoting our profession,

00:53.525 --> 01:00.332
and in keeping ourselves alive. I guess 
essentially your entire career has been

01:01.833 --> 01:04.556
supported by NSA money. Oh, yes. Absolutely. I 
was, as I say, worked for Kuiper as a summer student

01:06.137 --> 01:13.825
and then as a graduate student on NASA money. I was 
kept with student deferments from the Vietnam War

01:15.226 --> 01:23.194
because I was working in a university on NASA 
support ever since. And now, of course, I'm a NASA

01:28.021 --> 01:30.645
employee. How do you think NASA has managed this? I 
mean, have they understood what's going on in

01:33.749 --> 01:37.634
planetary astronomy? Or have they tried to 
overmanage, micromanage, whatever? Or have they

01:40.759 --> 01:42.541
done a reasonably good job? Well, they've done all 
of those things because they've tried it all ways.

01:46.447 --> 01:49.671
And in many respects, it has been done very well. 
The main problem, I think, is that because modern

01:50.039 --> 02:05.816
planetary science is a child of NASA and 
government funding, it has not found its way in

01:50.039 --> 02:05.816
fully legitimate ways into American academic 
circles. There are not enough planetary science

02:06.376 --> 02:13.243
positions in faculties in the universities in the 
United States. And this leaves planetary

02:13.824 --> 02:19.590
scientists in a very, very vulnerable position. 
NASA, I think, has made minor and relatively

02:20.110 --> 02:31.224
ineffective efforts to put planetary science in 
legitimate academic institutions around the

02:20.110 --> 02:31.224
country. But it could have done and should have 
done and must do much more. That is the real

02:35.830 --> 02:45.443
weakness in planetary science now, I think, is 
that as the government funding waxes and wanes,

02:35.830 --> 02:45.443
there is no adequate buffer in the American 
academic institutions to keep planetary science

02:46.115 --> 02:53.161
moderately comfortable. Do you think planetary 
astronomy is part of astronomy? Planetary

02:56.485 --> 03:01.829
astronomy, I think, is and should be considered 
part of astronomy. There

03:02.950 --> 03:09.356
was a time when I was less sure of that, maybe 10 
years ago. But the reason I'm adamant about it now

03:10.057 --> 03:15.582
is that it's clear to me that Classical astronomy 
is moving toward the understanding of the

03:16.321 --> 03:23.491
formation and development of planetary systems 
in general, and ours in particular. And at the same

03:24.032 --> 03:39.814
time, people with their training in planetary 
astronomy and planetary science are becoming

03:24.032 --> 03:39.814
more and more aware of the connection to the 
interstellar medium and the material that is

03:24.032 --> 03:39.814
formed there and incorporated into our solar 
system. When we hold in our hands, for example, a

03:39.834 --> 03:44.320
carbonaceous meteorite, we are holding 
pre-solar material, material which is preserved

03:45.937 --> 03:54.649
largely intact from its formation and chemical 
evolution in the interstellar medium. So there is

03:55.310 --> 04:08.649
a very natural connection in terms of materials 
that we can study, objects that we can look at

03:55.310 --> 04:08.649
between planetary astronomy studies of our solar 
system and studies of the interstellar medium.

04:10.191 --> 04:12.214
Sorry, Gene, to get into the Sorry to interrupt it 
yesterday when they were trying to take your

04:12.447 --> 04:15.950
picture. But you, I just told Dale here, in the 
drawing, I got a piece of Allende. Lucky dog. I saw

04:26.299 --> 04:27.420
it come in. Ed Barker and I were observing on the 
82-inch. It was a lot of serious. He was standing on

04:31.804 --> 04:34.006
the catwalk, and I was down the road. In Texas? 
Yeah. At McDonald's. And you talk about the

04:35.787 --> 04:38.990
ignorant peasants being scared. That thing, it 
was a coup d'etat run, you know, Brighton. The moon

04:41.810 --> 04:43.793
was just two days past full. That wiped it out. And 
you could see the smoke. It was like a crude oil tank

04:48.681 --> 04:50.784
blowing up. And I ran up to Ed and I said, it's got to 
be a carbonaceous chondrite. I mean, he's right

04:55.712 --> 04:57.134
here. You can ask him. I said that. But it looked 
like the Hindenburg going up, which was my first

04:58.596 --> 05:03.103
reaction. And so I got a piece of it. And I don't know 
who to tell except you characters. Who would

05:08.611 --> 05:10.112
appreciate that? Do you mind if you can do your 
stuff and we'll just talk over here? Sure. Just

05:15.058 --> 05:16.500
finishing up an interview.

05:20.145 --> 05:23.749
In the old days, there wasn't any Icarus. There 
wasn't any division for planetary sciences. And

05:27.814 --> 05:32.860
now planetary astronomers in this country have 
their own society and their own journal. You think

05:33.700 --> 05:34.641
that's good or bad? Well, I think it's good. On the 
one hand, it has provided a medium for us to publish

05:37.384 --> 05:43.511
all the kinds of things that we do. There is, of 
course, a downside to it. And a quick illustrative

05:46.314 --> 05:50.479
point might be useful. At the time that radio 
astronomy was developing as a kind of a separate

05:51.200 --> 06:00.450
discipline, there was some discussion as to 
whether or not the radio astronomers should have

05:51.200 --> 06:00.450
their own journal. And Otto Struve, I believe, was 
the vociferous proponent of not having a separate

06:00.903 --> 06:16.835
journal and keeping astrophysics unified 
through the astrophysical journal principally

06:00.903 --> 06:16.835
and the astronomical journal, whether the 
results come from the radio part of the spectrum or

06:00.903 --> 06:16.835
the optical infrared part of the spectrum. So 
that's a voice in favor of keeping things

06:17.256 --> 06:22.506
together. because, and this is now a personal 
view, because of the animosity or the

06:22.942 --> 06:46.361
ambivalence, let's soften it a bit too, that we've 
already talked about between classical

06:22.942 --> 06:46.361
astronomers and planetary scientists, there has 
developed a kind of set of different standards to

06:22.942 --> 06:46.361
which research papers should be held for 
publication. And I think that if If the

06:49.840 --> 06:57.649
Astrophysical Journal were the only medium for 
the publication of planetary science papers, we

06:49.840 --> 06:57.649
would have a lot of problems getting some of our 
work published. Not because it's intrinsically

06:58.089 --> 07:02.194
inferior in quality, but because it's different. 
And some of our standards are a bit different. Some

07:06.058 --> 07:10.744
of them are fully as rigorous as those to which 
classical astrophysicists hold their work.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.426
Certainly superior in cosmology. Perhaps, yes, I 
think so. found myself apologetic about the

07:15.676 --> 07:20.404
quality of spectra that I've published and 
interpreted from time to time. And then I

07:20.945 --> 07:26.353
occasionally see what my astrophysics 
colleagues are doing, and I feel less apologetic.

07:29.138 --> 07:35.228
What do you think was the impact of the fact that we 
have found no evidence for life anywhere else in

07:29.138 --> 07:35.228
the solar system? Do you think that's really hurt 
funding, in particular Mars? Oh, I don't think

07:39.855 --> 07:42.780
funding has been hurt by by the lack of funding life 
elsewhere. That seems to me to be quite a separate

07:47.487 --> 07:59.959
activity, endeavor, quite a separate 
philosophical issue to planetary science or to

07:47.487 --> 07:59.959
pure science. I've become more and more aware in 
just the last few years that so much science policy

08:01.580 --> 08:12.531
in the United States is politically driven, 
motivated, and controlled that it's almost

08:12.882 --> 08:18.789
independent of the scientific merit of projects 
that we're trying to do. This is certainly true of

08:19.270 --> 08:32.605
big science projects, such as planetary 
exploration programs, and most recently, the

08:19.270 --> 08:32.605
program for the search for extraterrestrial 
intelligence, which is such a politically

08:19.270 --> 08:32.605
charged issue. And which has been funded out of 
existence, I guess, this year. In just recent

08:36.650 --> 08:40.695
weeks, has been funded out of existence, at least 
at the moment. But you see that that political wind

08:41.131 --> 08:47.600
can change directions very quickly and may again. 
What do you think the public thinks about

08:49.543 --> 08:52.467
planetary astronomy? Planetary astronomy in the 
public's view, I think, is a productive and

08:52.487 --> 08:58.235
exciting endeavor. It's gotten a lot of press. 
It's highly amenable to promotion by exciting

09:00.899 --> 09:06.447
results and pictures to go with it. And it, in many 
ways, is the connection point between the public

09:06.899 --> 09:12.410
and astronomical science. It seems to me that, as a 
former teacher and as a person who talks publicly

09:12.810 --> 09:22.268
about science quite a bit, that the public has two 
points of connection with astronomy. One is, what

09:22.729 --> 09:29.903
is a black hole, which is a question that comes up at 
nearly every contact with a layperson. What are

09:30.237 --> 09:36.888
the planets made out of, or some other question of 
comparable interest specifically to solar

09:30.237 --> 09:36.888
system things? And I'd like to punctuate that by 
noting that projects which are primarily

09:37.469 --> 09:50.812
classical astrophysics in nature, such as the 
Hubble Space Telescope, get a tremendous amount

09:37.469 --> 09:50.812
of mileage out of their photographs of the 
planets. And I think that's just fine. I wish our

09:52.867 --> 10:03.627
astrophysics colleagues would acknowledge the 
value of planetary science, if only for its PR

09:52.867 --> 10:03.627
value in that respect. That brings up a point that 
Oren Nix, who's a co-investigator on this, made in

10:04.689 --> 10:11.402
his book, Far Travelers. It was something that I 
saw when I was at headquarters. that the, quote,

10:16.340 --> 10:25.932
real, unquote, scientists did not want any 
pictures, the theory being that if you could

10:16.340 --> 10:25.932
actually look at something and see right there 
that it wasn't real science. Did you get that

10:25.992 --> 10:27.234
impression? Well, maybe so. Maybe so. I'll

10:30.518 --> 10:44.676
go back to the issue of the composition of the 
surface of Triton and our detection of methane and

10:30.518 --> 10:44.676
nitrogen. The detection of those chemicals on 
Triton's surface was accomplished essentially

10:45.145 --> 10:54.755
at the time that Voyager was launched in the late 
70s, 1977. And only over the next several years did

10:55.756 --> 11:12.874
it become apparent that Voyager was actually 
going to go to Triton and have a look at this object

10:55.756 --> 11:12.874
that I'd been straining my eyes and telescopes to 
see for all those years and to get an up-close look.

11:14.238 --> 11:23.832
Now, I had pretty much concluded to my 
satisfaction and the satisfaction of the other

11:14.238 --> 11:23.832
very few colleagues interested in the subject of 
what Triton's surface would look like when we got

11:14.238 --> 11:23.832
there. But to then enjoy the extreme thrill of 
seeing it up close in my own lifetime, while it was

11:24.533 --> 11:39.013
still a topic of scientific interest and 
importance to me, was just about unparalleled. it

11:40.124 --> 11:48.877
did not, by having pictures of the surface of this 
object, decrease or diminish its interest to me or

11:40.124 --> 11:48.877
to my colleagues in the slightest way. And as I 
indicated, we've continued to observe this

11:49.378 --> 12:00.795
thing, even though we know in detail what its 
surface looks like, we've continued to observe it

11:49.378 --> 12:00.795
with ground-based telescopes where it remains an 
unresolved, faint, distant, cold point of light.

12:02.217 --> 12:07.465
Now, how that attitude persists with classical 
astrophysicists who now can see deep into the core

12:07.748 --> 12:19.482
of M31 with HST or deep into the cores of jetting 
galaxies and other objects of interest to

12:07.748 --> 12:19.482
astrophysicists? I don't know. I would hope that 
they haven't lost their interest and excitement

12:20.223 --> 12:26.912
in an object just because they can see it better. 
What kind of a job do you think planetary

12:28.854 --> 12:35.342
astronomers have done of selling themselves to 
the public and to the Congress? Planetary

12:36.723 --> 12:49.816
astronomers have not dealt well with Congress, in 
part because we are naive academics by nature and

12:36.723 --> 12:49.816
feel that politics and politicians are to be held 
at arm's distance. And it's only been in the last 10

12:50.777 --> 13:03.169
years that we as a profession have become aware of 
the necessity to deal with political people and

12:50.777 --> 13:03.169
political issues because we are a creation of a 
political entity. namely the National

13:03.503 --> 13:08.170
Aeronautics and Space Administration, and are 
totally dependent on government funding. People

13:09.573 --> 13:28.903
in the Congress have told us how naive we are and how 
aloof we have appeared to be, on the one hand,

13:09.573 --> 13:28.903
depending on the Congress and public funding for 
our support of our expensive hobbies, and on the

13:09.573 --> 13:28.903
other hand, being unwilling to deal with 
politicians in a real way. So planetary

13:29.170 --> 13:41.145
scientists have grown up a bit, I think, in the last 
decade or decade and a half through the necessity

13:29.170 --> 13:41.145
of having to deal with politics and politicians. 
So that's probably to the good. It isn't any fun.

13:45.010 --> 13:46.632
And I particularly don't like it. But it seems to be 
a fact of life. I don't think we do it very

13:51.579 --> 13:53.221
effectively yet. In terms of dealing with the 
public, I think we've done quite well. The Voyager

13:58.195 --> 14:10.648
missions and all the press that was attendant to 
those flybys, half a dozen of them, was a great

13:58.195 --> 14:10.648
experience, a great positive experience. 
Pictures of the planets from Voyager appeared on

14:11.149 --> 14:16.455
the covers of national news magazines around the 
world. Planetary scientists were interviewed. I

14:21.120 --> 14:21.801
was interviewed. And David Morrison and I, at the 
time that Pioneer went by Saturn, held what I think

14:27.980 --> 14:34.048
is the world's only and certainly the first press 
conference devoted entirely to Saturn satellite

14:27.980 --> 14:34.048
Iapetus. And so the public has gotten a dose of some 
rather arcane science through the successes of

14:35.189 --> 14:48.085
Voyager and Pioneer and Viking, of course, and 
Galileo. And we hope that that sequence will

14:48.105 --> 14:50.348
continue. I think we've done well with the public, 
not so well with the politicians. There's been a

14:53.950 --> 14:59.616
lot of attention in the past few years to making 
planetary astronomy a practical science. And

14:59.636 --> 15:09.507
there's been a lot of publicity, certainly, about 
killer asteroids, ozone hole, global warming,

14:59.636 --> 15:09.507
search for extraterrestrial intelligence. I 
suppose that's good for getting money. But do you

15:11.169 --> 15:12.771
think it's been overdone a bit? Well, I'm not sure 
it has been overdone. No, I don't think it has yet.

15:19.138 --> 15:22.422
And I'm not sure that there's any expectation that 
it will be overdone. There is, of course, some

15:23.397 --> 15:36.491
concern about returning to the thrilling days of 
yesteryear when planetary science had a crazy

15:23.397 --> 15:36.491
element, or at least a perceived crazy element, 
namely the diversable lowell types. And that

15:36.511 --> 15:46.001
could happen again if the crazies really did get a 
hold of these various topics.

15:46.742 --> 15:49.725
Planetary scientists have done a pretty good job 
of keeping that from happening. the issue of

15:50.127 --> 15:59.378
impacts on the Earth from comments and and so on has 
been promoted, discussed and embellished by

15:50.127 --> 15:59.378
genuine scientists. Eugene Shoemaker, David 
Morrison, Clark Chapman and various other people

16:00.380 --> 16:12.134
have been writing at the popular level and 
testifying before Congress and dealing with NASA

16:00.380 --> 16:12.134
committees in a very professional way. And this, I 
think, is what's keeping it from going going crazy

16:12.935 --> 16:17.721
in the city era. are into things. We have Jill 
Tarter, we have Frank Drake, we have Carl Sagan,

16:19.734 --> 16:28.844
all of whom are respected, very legitimate 
scientists dealing with these issues. And if we

16:29.044 --> 16:33.970
can keep it on that plane, I think we can keep it 
under control. What do you think the state of

16:34.810 --> 16:37.233
planetary astronomy is now? Going up, going down, 
hanging in there? Well, the state of planetary

16:39.235 --> 16:48.045
astronomy now here in the beginning of fiscal year 
94 is continuing to decline in terms of of the

16:48.498 --> 16:52.644
availability of public money for it. The National 
Science Foundation supports it at a very, very low

16:53.085 --> 16:56.230
level. And may not continue. And may not continue. 
NASA funding for planetary science is under

17:00.276 --> 17:08.990
continual attack and pressure, let's say, 
because of the cost of other NASA programs. Yet the

17:09.691 --> 17:13.577
population of planetary scientists continues to 
increase. and that's evidenced by the increased

17:13.996 --> 17:19.703
attendance at the Division for Planetary 
Sciences meetings held every year. And the

17:20.825 --> 17:35.123
quality of the work that comes out of those 
meetings continues to go up, and young people are

17:20.825 --> 17:35.123
continually attracted to this field, in spite of 
the fact that the funding pressure and the

17:20.825 --> 17:35.123
pressure for other resources continues to grow. 
So it's a peculiar situation, and I think that the

17:35.804 --> 17:39.328
reason that the interest in it continues to grow is 
because of its intrinsic value, its intrinsic

17:39.798 --> 17:50.250
interest, and its intrinsic relevance to 
understanding the Earth as a planet. Somebody's

17:51.311 --> 17:56.617
getting their bachelor's degree, and they're 
interested in planetary astronomy. What do you

17:57.298 --> 17:58.159
say to them? I say that your prospects for getting a 
job and support are not particularly good, but if

17:59.040 --> 18:06.328
you are driven to do this, for the same reasons that 
I was driven as a 13- or 14-year-old kid to do it,

18:06.713 --> 18:11.978
then go ahead. Give it your best shot. Well, that 
was actually the situation for astronomy in

18:12.959 --> 18:17.083
general when we were undergraduates. That's 
right, in a way. We were not encouraged to go into

18:20.606 --> 18:30.355
astronomy because there was any sense of 
lucrative employment or even a guarantee of any

18:20.606 --> 18:30.355
job or anything of the kind. And information 
distributed to random inquirers by the American

18:34.169 --> 18:45.300
Astronomical Society when I was a kid said such 
things as, there is very little room in astronomy

18:34.169 --> 18:45.300
for people of marginal ability. And that's 
probably still true. I consider myself a person of

18:48.403 --> 18:50.805
marginal ability. But I had super marginal

18:51.186 --> 18:57.372
persistence and dedication. And I had to become an 
astronomer. And so I did. And I've been able to do it

19:03.008 --> 19:05.331
reasonably successfully. Before there was even 
an NSA. Before there was, yes. And so I would tell a

19:08.754 --> 19:15.702
person in the situation you just described that if 
you have to do this, then you have to do it. And

19:16.202 --> 19:19.486
somehow you and the rest of us will find a way. And so 
when I find such a person with that kind of

19:20.267 --> 19:30.518
dedication and devotion, I do my very best to make 
them feel welcome in this profession, to help

19:20.267 --> 19:30.518
them. both professionally and at the technical 
level, and try to get them involved, because

19:30.751 --> 19:39.239
that's where the discoveries will come from, is 
the people who are driven to do it. The death of the

19:40.099 --> 19:50.188
Mars Observer Probe, to me at least, seemed to come 
as a shock to a lot of people that have been in this

19:40.099 --> 19:50.188
field for only 10 or 20 years. We both remember when 
failures of planetary and lunar probes were the

19:52.691 --> 19:58.816
norm rather than the exception. Do you think this 
is a a good slap in the face to wake some people up?

20:06.114 --> 20:12.140
Well, in a way, it's a slap in the face in many 
respects. Or a dash of cold water. A dash of cold

20:14.983 --> 20:15.884
water. It certainly shows that one can't be 
sanguine about the successes from complicated,

20:15.904 --> 20:25.414
expensive space probes. It's probably Vikings 
kind of work. Yes, it is. I think people got fat and

20:28.337 --> 20:31.039
happy. Yes, we did. One of the most serious 
elements of this now, of course, is that there are

20:32.243 --> 20:59.550
very few other spacecraft programs that are 
flying or expected to fly in a reasonable amount of

20:32.243 --> 20:59.550
time, whereas in the 70s and 80s there were 
programs under development more or less

20:32.243 --> 20:59.550
continuously, and at least the prospect of flying 
was not too remote or too distant. young people

21:00.357 --> 21:01.979
coming into the field. And also, we were going to 
planets that were relatively close by and didn't

21:02.159 --> 21:06.726
take forever to get there. So the situation is 
different now in that a person who has just been

21:09.109 --> 21:28.575
terminated in a funding sense by the failure of 
Mars Observer doesn't necessarily have any

21:09.109 --> 21:28.575
prospects on the immediate horizon to pick them up 
and to keep them actively employed and

21:09.109 --> 21:28.575
scientifically productive in the intervening 
years. That's a very serious problem because some

21:29.078 --> 21:35.527
of these people will be forced to drift away into 
other fields just because of the lack of support.

21:35.847 --> 21:38.311
There is no buffer program which can pick them up. 
This is a leading question and it calls for a

21:38.771 --> 21:43.198
personal answer. I have heard it said at DPS 
meetings that we need planetary probes to keep the

21:44.239 --> 21:54.313
scientists interested. My theory feeling always 
was that if the scientists were supposed to

21:58.812 --> 22:02.858
generate the interest themselves, whether they 
have probes or not. Your comments? Well, I tend to

22:06.044 --> 22:21.709
feel, as I think you do, that the intrinsic merit of 
this science will generate the interest on the

22:06.044 --> 22:21.709
part of people truly devoted to planetary 
studies, independent of the probes. The probes

22:22.029 --> 22:25.174
provide the Very, very important. Stuff that we 
otherwise couldn't get at all. Things that we

22:29.194 --> 22:31.576
cannot do in any other way, that's true. But we've 
already seen just a few days ago that work from

22:32.237 --> 22:53.136
essentially images of Mars from the distance of 
the Earth can be taken in the proper way, in this

22:32.237 --> 22:53.136
case with the Hubble Space Telescope, but also 
from the ground, can still produce important

22:32.237 --> 22:53.136
science, despite the fact that we've been to Mars 
with a number of orbiters and two landers from the

22:32.237 --> 22:53.136
United States and so on. So there's still a lot of 
work that can be done on the planets, but some of it

22:53.504 --> 22:58.131
simply cannot be done without probes. 
Nonetheless, there are many compelling

22:59.974 --> 23:13.814
planetary problems that will keep real 
scientists interested indefinitely into the

22:59.974 --> 23:13.814
future, even if there is never another planetary 
probe. The field will shrink, of course, and there

23:13.834 --> 23:19.102
will be a smaller number of people doing it. But the 
people who are driven to understand The solar

23:21.652 --> 23:33.071
system, its nature, and its relationship to other 
systems of stars and dust and things in our galaxy

23:21.652 --> 23:33.071
and elsewhere will do this work no matter what. One 
last and leading question. I was going to say, what

23:36.997 --> 23:42.746
do you think, in the last 30 years, the greatest 
development in planetary astronomy has been? But

23:42.826 --> 23:45.651
I'm reminded of the fact that when we were 
students, there were the gas giants, and then

23:46.171 --> 23:49.595
there were the terrestrial planets. And we didn't 
realize there's a whole different kind of planet,

23:49.955 --> 23:56.683
you know, the ice planets and all that sort of 
stuff. Do you think that is the most important

23:57.263 --> 24:02.369
thing we found out, or do you have your particular 
candidate? Well, I think it's very important that

24:02.389 --> 24:12.921
we've discovered that each planet is its own kind, 
and that there is this vast collection of icy

24:02.389 --> 24:12.921
bodies in the outer solar system But I'm inclined 
to think that the most important realization is a

24:13.323 --> 24:28.620
picture that's still evolving and emerging, and a 
picture to which not all planetary scientists

24:13.323 --> 24:28.620
have yet signed up. And that is our connection to 
interstellar space, to other material elsewhere

24:29.200 --> 24:34.847
in the galaxy. I'm particularly impressed by the 
detection of organic material in the solar

24:35.547 --> 24:43.296
system, even in the inner solar system, that 
clearly had its origins on the grains of

24:43.647 --> 24:51.358
interstellar dust among the stars in the diffuse 
interstellar medium. This material, some of it

24:52.560 --> 25:00.691
has come into the solar system relatively 
unaltered, and we're just beginning to detect and

24:52.560 --> 25:00.691
understand that. Other of that material has been 
highly altered, and we are some of that stuff.
