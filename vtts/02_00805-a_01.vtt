00:01.162 --> 00:19.033
This

00:01.162 --> 00:19.033
is an interview with Dr. R. D. Turk, retired 
professor of veterinarian

00:01.162 --> 00:19.033
parasitology.

00:21.256 --> 00:26.325
Today's date is January 9th, 1980, and this is 
Terry Anderson.

00:32.903 --> 00:35.807
Right, okay.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.453
This is an interview with Dr. R.D. Turk, retired 
professor of veterinarian parasitology.

00:43.619 --> 00:48.446
Today's date is January 9th, 1980, and this is 
Terry Anderson. Dr. Turk, could you tell us about

00:49.407 --> 00:53.714
your background, where and when you were born? 
Well, I was born in a little town of Ice Grove,

00:55.977 --> 00:59.923
Missouri. Population 1,000 on August 1, 1903. OK.

01:06.147 --> 01:15.060
Can you tell us something about your parents? My 
parents were Joseph H. and Laura B. Turton. My dad

01:23.432 --> 01:27.578
ran a hardware store in Ice Grove. And my mother was 
a housekeeper. I was number four in a family of six.

01:39.356 --> 01:42.960
Two sisters and three brothers. What about your 
father's education? He had a high school

01:45.722 --> 01:54.851
education, but

01:45.722 --> 01:54.851
was fairly well read. And in addition to being a 
hardware dealer, He was also mayor several times

02:01.109 --> 02:05.554
and president of the local school board.

02:09.338 --> 02:26.095
My mother had two years of college in a

02:09.338 --> 02:26.095
local college, which has long now been closed.

02:26.115 --> 02:27.497
Was it a religious college? No.

02:35.585 --> 02:38.768
What type of people were your parents? I don't 
understand what you mean, what kind of people.

02:41.251 --> 02:43.153
Well, could you characterize them for me? Well, 
they were just good, hard-working people. My

02:49.119 --> 02:55.285
mother was raised in Babbage, and when she married 
my dad, she changed over to the Prevotarian place.

02:55.305 --> 03:02.352
He was superintendent of the Prevotarian Sunday 
School for umpteen years.

03:05.167 --> 03:10.895
We all joined the Presbyterian Church at a 
comparatively early age. Can you tell me about

03:12.017 --> 03:16.323
your early life, your education? Well, since we 
had six kids and ten cows, we had a place on the

03:16.343 --> 03:26.697
outskirts of town about 15 acres. And the cows 
helped us

03:27.939 --> 03:34.448
eat. and clothes. Otherwise, I took money from the 
hardware store.

03:46.347 --> 03:55.459
I repeated the first grade of Astro Community 
School due to illness. But then I skipped the fifth

03:57.442 --> 03:59.625
grade.

04:04.364 --> 04:16.140
So I graduated from Astro High School in the class 
of 21, third from the bottom.

04:16.160 --> 04:27.736
The third from the bottom was not due to my

04:16.160 --> 04:27.736
lack of ability to learn, but rather to my 
inability to stay out of mischief. It's rather

04:29.980 --> 04:31.722
difficult to graduate top man in your class when 
you've been expelled twice. Oh, really? What were

04:38.479 --> 04:39.541
you expelled for? Well, first time for 
inadvertently hitting a teacher in the head with

04:40.362 --> 04:49.336
an eraser. I wasn't aiming at him. He had 
temporarily left the room and I was getting even

04:55.024 --> 05:00.072
with the big boy in the front row. And he returned 
just in time to see the boy duck and catch the eraser

05:01.098 --> 05:05.784
in his eye.

05:09.329 --> 05:26.211
The second time, I and three other seniors decided 
we would paint Astro HS on the schoolhouse roof

05:09.329 --> 05:26.211
with the number 21.

05:30.663 --> 05:37.594
Unfortunately, the principal came in and found 
the ladder leading up to the attic. And as he

05:37.614 --> 05:40.799
climbed up the steps, I stamped on his toes.

05:44.124 --> 05:44.725
Enough said. Fortunately, my dad was president of 
the school board. So I was returned to school under

05:53.338 --> 05:58.105
the proviso that I make a public apology to all 
concerned,

05:59.519 --> 06:06.952
which, incidentally, was difficult to do.

06:11.099 --> 06:24.042
Following high school, I worked a year in the local 
post office with the magnificent title of

06:11.099 --> 06:24.042
assistant postmaster and the

06:27.565 --> 06:29.166
Yearly stipend of $300. 300? Yeah. What year was 
that? 1922. 1922, 300, my goodness. $25 a month.

06:42.078 --> 06:45.201
Can you tell me about the interest that you had in 
high school?

06:48.204 --> 06:51.387
Well, I really didn't have too many. Even that time 
was had defective hearing, so I spent most of my

06:56.658 --> 07:13.721
time reading

06:56.658 --> 07:13.721
Law Comes to Houndo Valley or smoking six guns 
rather than listening to the lectures.

07:13.741 --> 07:26.158
But I was always interested in animals, partly due 
to the 10 cows and partly due to being neighbor to a

07:13.741 --> 07:26.158
veterinarian.

07:29.108 --> 07:53.134
Since he was a relative newcomer, having arrived 
there after World War I,

07:29.108 --> 07:53.134
he would take me with him to locate the various 
farms and incidentally to help where help was

07:29.108 --> 07:53.134
needed.

07:53.154 --> 07:58.980
I actually made more going with the veterinarian 
than I did from my job as assistant Postmaster.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.788
Why did you decide to go on to college? Well there's 
a long story about that. We didn't have too much

08:10.771 --> 08:22.563
money so I went to Kansas City, Missouri where I 
took a job with American Radiator Company.

08:23.724 --> 08:24.625
Radiator Company? American Radiator Company.

08:30.905 --> 08:41.040
And

08:30.905 --> 08:41.040
they offered me a job, $15 a week in the office,

08:30.905 --> 08:41.040
or $35 a week in the foundry. So naturally, I took 
the foundry job.

08:49.713 --> 08:57.385
I'd saved up $1,500

08:49.713 --> 08:57.385
to go to the bus queue, and the bank closed. I got 3% 
back, which you don't have to be a mathematician to

08:59.508 --> 09:07.457
realize that was $45. Was this in 1929 or 30? No, 
that was 1923, 24. And the bank closed them. Yeah.

09:21.252 --> 09:24.475
The president of the bank had been playing the 
stock market. There was one, it was a... pretty

09:28.516 --> 09:33.042
much a one-man bank. Actually, it was called the 
Centropolis

09:33.062 --> 09:38.670
Bank. I don't remember the other name,

09:39.371 --> 09:45.519
but it was on East 70.

09:49.305 --> 09:55.333
It was on East

09:49.305 --> 09:55.333
64th Street.

09:58.182 --> 10:05.393
American Radiator Company was at 200 East 15th 
Street, so I banked there as a matter of

09:58.182 --> 10:05.393
convenience.

10:08.537 --> 10:12.083
Naturally, I decided to keep my money spent up 
after that.

10:14.947 --> 10:24.561
So with a new Ford car and lots of help,

10:14.947 --> 10:24.561
I had no trouble.

10:28.017 --> 10:37.188
In 1928, the American Radiator Company

10:28.017 --> 10:37.188
closed down temporarily. And at that time, I was a

10:39.491 --> 10:49.223
skilled iron moulder.

10:54.089 --> 10:57.653
So I went to Chicago, where I had no trouble

11:03.488 --> 11:19.226
containing a job with the

11:03.488 --> 11:19.226
International Harvester Company

11:03.488 --> 11:19.226
at 31st and Blue Island in Chicago.

11:23.952 --> 11:33.343
After a year living in Chicago in a 40th boarding 
house on South Houston Street, I decided in held it

11:35.264 --> 11:43.734
a little bit more for me than

11:35.264 --> 11:43.734
being a foundry worker. So I came back to Kansas 
City in the spring of 1929.

11:53.787 --> 12:04.360
Spent the remainder of the summer

11:53.787 --> 12:04.360
driving an oil truck for the entire

11:53.787 --> 12:04.360
oil company.

12:08.947 --> 12:31.478
and enrolled at Kansas State, which at that time, 
Kansas State Agriculture College, KSAC, in

12:08.947 --> 12:31.478
Budner Medicine.

12:31.498 --> 12:32.760
While in the foundry,

12:37.195 --> 13:02.563
I also moonlighted somewhat

12:37.195 --> 13:02.563
driving taxi cab a few months one winter when I was 
laid off

12:37.195 --> 13:02.563
and boxing at the Bell Telephone Company

12:37.195 --> 13:02.563
Friday night smokers. Really?

13:06.187 --> 13:14.197
I was a pretty good boxer at 127 pounds, but one 
night I met a Mexican boy with six hands.

13:18.103 --> 13:26.473
I didn't remember anything from Friday 
afternoon, or Friday evening rather, till Monday

13:18.103 --> 13:26.473
morning, so I decided that boxing was not for me.

13:30.399 --> 13:34.624
The only nice thing was when I went to Kansas State I 
didn't have to take physical education because

13:36.241 --> 13:43.470
I'd been a professional athlete. Did you ever make 
much money boxing? Oh, yes. $25 a night. Oh, is that

13:50.158 --> 13:50.999
what it was? $25 a night? For three three-round 
bouts. Three three-round? With three different

13:59.148 --> 14:00.249
opponents? Well, no. One round went three 
three-round bouts. Oh, I see. Oh, they had a whole

14:06.353 --> 14:12.422
bunch of hungry kids. Get up there and flail around 
and get your ass knocked over. Yeah,

14:18.310 --> 14:24.498
all right. I had a little difficulty getting into 
Kansas State for several reasons. First, I was

14:31.388 --> 14:34.632
eight years older than the majority of my class 
since I graduated from Ash Grove High School in

14:36.367 --> 14:46.580
1921 and entered college in 1929.

14:48.502 --> 14:58.575
Second, I'd had no physics, no chemistry, and only 
three units of English.

15:01.379 --> 15:04.062
However, I took a comprehensive examination

15:08.446 --> 15:16.976
and past with satisfactory results due primarily 
to my omnipotent reading. I was born slightly

15:18.758 --> 15:24.365
deaf, or rather with impaired hearing.

15:27.449 --> 15:30.693
So reading was really my pastime.

15:33.095 --> 15:34.437
Much to my surprise,

15:37.032 --> 15:51.589
I ended up my freshman year

15:37.032 --> 15:51.589
with a straight A average with the exception

15:37.032 --> 15:51.589
of military.

15:55.393 --> 16:01.560
When they'd holler the command, I would usually 
step behind because I couldn't hear very good.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.786
I went back to the and

16:07.222 --> 16:20.495
got accused for military, so one year in the ROTC as 
a freshman is all the military record I had.

16:26.240 --> 16:35.389
I graduated from Kansas State with the highest 
grades in veterinary medicine

16:38.339 --> 16:41.363
that had been turned in up to that time. I think it's 
been surpassed since then. But anyway, with the

16:49.814 --> 17:01.430
exception of military science,

16:49.814 --> 17:01.430
the only other B grade I made was in poultry 
husbandry. Due to the fact I used to return to

17:07.246 --> 17:24.105
Kansas City on occasional weekends, and 
sometimes would miss the train coming back, and

17:07.246 --> 17:24.105
thus miss the 8 o'clock Monday morning session in 
Poultry Husbandry.

17:28.050 --> 17:32.134
Well, could you describe the curriculum at Kansas 
State? Well, let me tell you first how I stayed in

17:32.154 --> 17:33.796
there. Oh, fine. I got a job in the department of 
pathology

17:35.326 --> 17:53.186
and so I could work from seven to eight and from 
after school till as long as was necessary.

17:56.049 --> 18:03.578
I got 25 cents an hour my freshman year and then In my 
sophomore year, I was zoomed up to 35 minutes an

18:04.469 --> 18:21.288
hour, which,

18:04.469 --> 18:21.288
with a little help from home, let me keep body and 
soul together. The curriculum,

18:23.651 --> 18:34.223
incidentally, the job

18:23.651 --> 18:34.223
was mine after school hours I was there by myself 
with the job of cleaning up glassware and the

18:34.675 --> 18:50.301
microscopes and various other duties. So I spent 
quite a bit of time studying on company time.

18:58.503 --> 19:01.547
Nevertheless, it must have been difficult during 
the Depression. It must have been difficult

19:01.927 --> 19:04.150
during the Depression. It was. It was rather 
difficult, but it had its advantages. Two

19:08.856 --> 19:10.398
hamburgers were a nickel.

19:13.142 --> 19:13.282
Mm-hmm. All soft drinks were a nickel. Pie was 10 
cents a quarter. And it took a lot of ingenuity to

19:19.029 --> 19:27.119
spend a dollar for one meal. Mm-hmm.

19:31.612 --> 19:36.379
I joined Masonic Lodge in March of 1929. So I

19:36.659 --> 19:55.527
joined the Acacia Fraternity in 1931 and was

19:36.659 --> 19:55.527
president of the fraternity the year I graduated.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.582
The curriculum was primarily basic. The freshman 
year was anatomy, histology,

20:04.664 --> 20:25.389
and

20:04.664 --> 20:25.389
chemistry.

20:27.912 --> 20:30.475
And I forget the other sophomore year, pathology, 
more anatomy,

20:31.805 --> 20:55.497
biological chemistry,

20:31.805 --> 20:55.497
elementary course in physics,

20:31.805 --> 20:55.497
and so forth.

20:55.517 --> 20:58.521
Junior and senior years we got into clinics.

21:01.657 --> 21:19.236
And really, I don't remember the names of the 
specific courses, but we had non-infectious

21:01.657 --> 21:19.236
diseases, infectious diseases, clinical 
diagnosis, and

21:01.657 --> 21:19.236
more pathology. Due to my job in the pathology 
department, most of the pathology was just a

21:21.078 --> 21:27.765
review.

21:32.673 --> 21:34.195
And I graduated with honors.

21:39.881 --> 22:02.005
Since the world was not meeting a path to my door in 
1933,

21:39.881 --> 22:02.005
I stayed on in the Department of Pathology

21:39.881 --> 22:02.005
as an assistant until September 1 at the 
magnificent salary of 75 cents an hour. I

22:02.643 --> 22:16.135
then took a job with the University of Illinois at 
$1,500

22:02.643 --> 22:16.135
a year.

22:25.423 --> 22:31.789
But

22:25.423 --> 22:31.789
due to my defective hearing, I

22:33.136 --> 22:41.744
had a little difficulty, and so I quit.

22:47.951 --> 22:50.073
What were you teaching at the University of 
Illinois? I wasn't teaching. I was clinical

22:52.055 --> 22:52.996
assistant. I see.

22:59.422 --> 23:01.624
And came back to Columbus, Kansas. and open to 
practice.

23:07.712 --> 23:08.693
That was a mistake.

23:11.696 --> 23:23.267
By Christmas 1933, I, pardon me,

23:11.696 --> 23:23.267
no, I netted $200 cash.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.915
In May of 1934,

23:35.894 --> 23:40.781
It stopped raining, and the grasshoppers moved 
in.

23:44.106 --> 23:46.269
And in August 1934, I netted $60.

23:49.333 --> 24:03.994
Since

23:49.333 --> 24:03.994
my fixed expenses were $5 a month for our office,

24:06.944 --> 24:19.301
and $10 a week for board and room

24:06.944 --> 24:19.301
with gasoline, $0.15 a gallon,

24:06.944 --> 24:19.301
I wasn't breaking even.

24:25.189 --> 24:32.479
About that time, the federal government 
instituted what is known as the cattle reduction

24:25.189 --> 24:32.479
program.

24:35.952 --> 24:57.304
The idea was to,

24:35.952 --> 24:57.304
rather than plow the little pigs under, or rather 
plow the cotton under and

24:35.952 --> 24:57.304
kill all the pigs, that they would test the cattle 
and take out the diseased ones and leave the

24:35.952 --> 24:57.304
healthy cattle there. So I went to Oklahoma.

25:03.714 --> 25:04.255
Pardon me. So I went to Oklahoma working for USDA.

25:11.796 --> 25:31.947
At the French's salary of $1,500 a year,

25:11.796 --> 25:31.947
plus a nickel a mile on my car,

25:11.796 --> 25:31.947
plus $5 a day, which included hotel board, hotel 
room, and meals.

25:35.842 --> 25:37.844
That must have been considered a very good job. It 
was a good job. It was cash. But I am ashamed to admit

25:42.889 --> 25:50.097
it, but I cheated sometimes on the meals. I'd jack 
up the back wheel of the car and let it run while I was

25:51.518 --> 25:56.283
eating dinner. Five cents a mile for seven miles 
would give you 35 cents, which quite a feat. Then in

26:09.007 --> 26:25.548
1935,

26:09.007 --> 26:25.548
due to my academic background, they

26:09.007 --> 26:25.548
decided to move me into Oklahoma City to take 
charge of the Bang Disease Laboratory. The what

26:26.570 --> 26:27.331
disease? B-A-N-G.

26:30.615 --> 26:34.620
Possibly S. More commonly known as brucellosis,

26:35.343 --> 26:48.197
which is an infectious abortion of cattle.

26:48.217 --> 27:04.135
We prepared our own antigen and

26:48.217 --> 27:04.135
tested all the samples brought in from other young 
men who were also working for the Among

27:04.537 --> 27:24.721
the employees was a young lady named June 
Hardesty, H-A-R-D-E-S-Y,

27:04.537 --> 27:24.721
who was a skilled laboratory technician.

27:28.305 --> 27:29.667
She worked for me a year.

27:33.106 --> 27:34.828
And I've been working for her ever since. To make a 
long story short, in December of 1935, I

27:36.470 --> 27:56.695
was told by the power to be that I was to be 
transferred to Baltimore, Maryland

27:36.470 --> 27:56.695
for the United States Department of Agriculture 
to work in a laboratory there. I didn't like the

27:58.778 --> 27:59.879
East. I'd been to Chicago. So

28:03.734 --> 28:09.140
I was really lost what to do. I wanted to get 
married, and I didn't want to go back where the snow

28:09.180 --> 28:13.685
flies.

28:17.430 --> 28:26.260
So out of the clear blue sky, I got a letter from Dr. 
H. Smith. It was a Texas ag culture experiment

28:28.282 --> 28:30.585
statement. asking me would I be interested in a job 
at Texas A&M. He didn't say what the job consisted

28:37.594 --> 28:44.161
of or what the salary paid or anything. How did he 
even know of you? Had he met you before? He had

28:48.125 --> 28:48.966
written around. Oh, he had written around. I 
imagine. I never did find out. I never did find out.

28:57.035 --> 28:59.638
And he just grinned and said, well, I just heard of 
you. But anyway. I was offered a job at $2,400 a year

29:03.202 --> 29:08.250
at Texas A&M. That's $200 on 12 months. And most of 
the employees of the college proper, a lot of them

29:15.040 --> 29:24.795
were getting $1,500 and $1,800 for nine months. In 
fact, there were PhDs in chemistry and physics and

29:26.357 --> 29:31.926
English and various liberal arts that were only 
getting 15, 18, or $2,000 for nine months. So I

29:41.108 --> 29:46.735
tickled the old man, I think, or rather the word 
would be amused. I just wrote back, yes, when will I

29:46.755 --> 29:50.800
report? And that tickled him, so he said February 
1. That was all the correspondence we went through

29:54.345 --> 29:58.269
for my job. But I wanted the laboratory because of 
my hearing So June and I got married February 18th.

30:12.875 --> 30:21.244
I spent a week at home visiting

30:12.875 --> 30:21.244
and reported to Texas on February 1, 1936.

30:25.149 --> 30:29.974
June wondered what kind of a town was College 
Station. I said, I don't know. I have no idea. So we

30:33.280 --> 30:36.483
came through Curtin, and I said, well, it's not 
very big, is it? Then we saw another town that said

30:38.004 --> 30:40.246
Bryan. I said, well, I think College of Dayton is 
fairly close to Bryan. So we came into Bryan,

30:46.111 --> 30:49.194
stayed at the old LaSalle Hotel.

30:52.337 --> 30:54.098
I went out the next morning to report.

30:57.381 --> 31:02.005
And much to my surprise, College of Dayton was just 
a campus. All the profs lived on the campus and

31:02.373 --> 31:05.237
everybody else over there. There were a few 
colored people living outside and there were some

31:05.257 --> 31:11.465
farms come up almost against it.

31:14.809 --> 31:17.493
Dr. Smith said, well, I'm glad you're here. I said, 
I'm glad I'm here also. So I wanted to be honest with

31:22.760 --> 31:26.064
him and I told him, I said, I don't hear very well. He 
said, well, that's all right. Don't worry about

31:28.767 --> 31:29.809
that. I'll talk loud enough you can hear me.
