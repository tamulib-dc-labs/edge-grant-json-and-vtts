00:01.482 --> 00:02.604
Hello, kitty, kitty, kitty. Hello, kitty, kitty, 
kitty. I'm going to get you to talk to me. When this

00:09.694 --> 00:19.028
was all in, when, during the Depression, and when I 
say Depression, that was back in the good old days.

00:19.149 --> 00:19.489
I know. You had to do without your meat, your 
sweets, and your sugar, and all that kind of stuff.

00:24.296 --> 00:24.997
Your flour. What? And you, well, um, Her mother 
always fixed graham biscuits for Uncle Sam, and

00:30.254 --> 00:40.229
she actually didn't know any different, which is 
great. And she thought everybody ate them. But

00:43.674 --> 00:45.056
they didn't. And she'd come to our house, and we'd 
have cornbread. And she didn't know what it was.

00:53.137 --> 00:55.179
But old Lennon would say, I want some more. And we'd 
have a mania night. All we'd have for supper would

00:59.442 --> 01:04.487
be cornbread and what we call Friday gravy. And by 
the way, we ate it. And a glass of milk, whether it

01:07.729 --> 01:13.794
would be clabber or sweet milk or buttermilk. We 
had that milk. But we had a very humble home. but one

01:23.157 --> 01:28.084
that I wouldn't trade for all the modern ones in the 
world. Mother sat at the foot of the table and Daddy

01:28.104 --> 01:33.571
at the head. And we had a bench. In those days, 
children sat on benches. And we all three sat on one

01:39.399 --> 01:43.645
bench, right down this way. And the other part of 
the table was pushed up against the wall. So we'd

01:46.990 --> 01:52.337
have more room in the dining room. i was the first 
one and then next was margaret and james was next to

01:52.705 --> 02:20.248
mother he was the baby and she would see well our 
plates were set by the side of dads and our knife and

01:52.705 --> 02:20.248
fork and spoon and napkin and our napkin ring now we 
had napkin rings and our napkins our napkins Nine

02:21.393 --> 02:24.998
times out of ten were made out of flour sacks. But we 
had a napkin. It wasn't made out of an old shirt tail

02:27.681 --> 02:32.267
that hadn't wore out. But we had a napkin. We took 
that napkin and we sat down and we unfolded it and

02:35.171 --> 02:40.458
put it in our lap. And we put our hands down in our 
lap. And our father asked the blessing. And then he

02:47.498 --> 02:52.092
served our plate and we passed it down. James Ely 
was served first, and then Margaret. I mean,

02:56.284 --> 03:02.630
mother was served first, and then James, and then 
Margaret and me. I was the last one, and my dad was

03:02.870 --> 03:07.274
next to last to be served. No one picked up a fork and 
started to dive in until everyone was served. And

03:13.059 --> 03:22.348
then my father would always say, bless this food, 
God, to the nourishment of our body and to our soul,

03:13.059 --> 03:22.348
and help us to love our fellow man more dearly each 
day. That was just clockwork. That's beautiful.

03:31.600 --> 03:41.774
He'd already asked the blessing, but the food was 
to be blessed for the nourishment of our body and

03:31.600 --> 03:41.774
that we would live to love our fellow man. That's 
beautiful. To me, I wouldn't take for it. And then

03:47.802 --> 03:51.947
at night when we'd get ready for bed, It wasn't, go 
on, go to bed. Get your things and get to bed. Get out

03:55.709 --> 03:56.369
of here. I want to read or I want to listen. No. 
Mother would sit in that old chair. I gave the chair

04:03.116 --> 04:05.679
to Mark. But anyway, it was that old rocking chair. 
And she'd be sitting in it. And she'd say, we always

04:12.246 --> 04:15.810
had to hang our nightclothes. We had no closets on 
the nail behind the door in our room. So we'd go in

04:20.354 --> 04:21.816
there. and get our clothes off of the nail and dress 
in our room, hang our clothes that we wore up on this

04:22.420 --> 04:35.656
nail that we took our gown off of. It wouldn't be 
laying on the floor, but they'd be hanging up

04:36.797 --> 04:43.284
behind that door, because that room was going to be 
straight. And we'd come back into Mama's room, and

04:44.906 --> 04:52.275
she would gather us around her knee. And always, I 
would be on the right, Margaret in the middle, and

04:53.133 --> 05:02.521
James on the left. And she'd put her hand on each one 
of us as we said our prayers. And it was now I lay me

05:09.447 --> 05:13.150
down to sleep. But it was a real prayer. And we would 
always, it didn't make any difference how bad we'd

05:16.773 --> 05:23.038
been that day and how many whippings we'd got. Help 
me to be a better girl tomorrow. Help me to

05:26.494 --> 05:31.339
understand and mind my parents. That was 
ritualistic.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.204
That was ritualistic. Help me to mind my parents. 
Honor thy father and thy mother that the days may be

05:39.226 --> 05:45.132
long upon the earth which the Lord thy God giveth 
thee. That was ritualistic.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.160
And that's the reason I don't understand children 
But it's home. It reverts back to home. And lots of

06:01.360 --> 06:05.607
times, we'd sing. We'd sit around, and we'd sing 
songs. And she would read the Bible and tell us

06:10.655 --> 06:13.859
stories. Or she'd read a good story out of a lady's 
home journal. Well, we had a pictorial review. and

06:22.722 --> 06:24.264
a ladies home journal. Well, the pictorial review 
come earlier, and we got ladies home journal much

06:24.284 --> 06:29.870
later. And of course, we got a weekly newspaper. 
San Antonio Express was a weekly newspaper. And we

06:40.763 --> 06:44.427
didn't get mail here but three times a week. That's 
the main thing. And we take what they call a little

06:47.495 --> 06:57.325
old newspaper that was printed in Chicago called 
The Grit. And it's still in publication. And it has

07:00.028 --> 07:02.310
a lot of good reading in it today. Now, don't forget 
that. Lots of good reading in today. And that would

07:07.196 --> 07:12.521
come in our San Antonio Express weekly. Our 
weekly. No telephone, no radios, and all we got was

07:15.001 --> 07:25.352
by word or mouth from neighbors. That system of 
telling who's done what, when, and how it's going.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.099
And come by to see you. And I think, well, there was a 
heap of living in those days. There really was. We

07:42.210 --> 07:43.371
had an old piano. And when I won't tell you right 
now, all of us would sit down and take our hand at it,

07:44.127 --> 07:54.538
whether we played good or whether we didn't. We 
enjoyed it. And that's what counts. My mother and

07:59.143 --> 08:02.787
father had the most beautiful voices together 
that ever was. Mother sang soprano and daddy sang

08:04.088 --> 08:06.651
tenor. And mother was a pretty woman. And my daddy 
was. a handsome man.

08:18.271 --> 08:26.382
And I guess love makes them look prettier.

08:26.402 --> 08:41.623
I guess the deep feeling that you have and the 
respect you have for your parents, they just look

08:26.402 --> 08:41.623
different to you than to anybody else. I don't 
know, Mother just looked like a queen every time

08:43.105 --> 08:49.274
she stepped out. And she was so erect in her walk and 
so portly. And she held herself so well. She wasn't

09:00.952 --> 09:05.379
slovenly in her walk. And her manner of dress was 
always so very, very neat. Now the difference in

09:11.860 --> 09:17.162
the two women and my mother and Lennon's mother 
Lennon's mother was never needing her clothes.

09:21.351 --> 09:23.414
Lennon was just exactly like her. God bless him. 
His shirt tail would be out somewhere. And he had

09:29.000 --> 09:32.004
nice clothes and everything. And he could, if you 
just catch him just right before he got on the

09:32.845 --> 09:41.055
stage, just push him on there and see that he's 
ruined perfect. He'd be all right. But by the time

09:42.657 --> 09:45.421
he got off of it, there'd be something wrong. 
Really? Every time. But that's just the way with

09:48.361 --> 09:52.045
people. It is. You know, I think it's, I think that. 
And I think a lot of that rubbed off on me. I think so.

10:03.378 --> 10:06.121
Well, eat all you want out of it. I'm hungry for good 
food. You're hungry for food. Well, that's great.

10:11.632 --> 10:24.658
Well, it's like, I agree there's nothing like the 
kind of life that I, and I say we had here, as you know

10:11.632 --> 10:24.658
I had, a great part of what you're talking about in 
my home before my mother died. We came from this out

10:25.620 --> 10:30.670
part of the country into Austin. And I had, as you 
say, the napkins made out of shirt tails or

10:30.650 --> 10:43.108
whatever was available and the rugs that 
everybody just, if you couldn't pass it down

10:30.650 --> 10:43.108
anymore, it ended up being ripped up for a rag rug. 
Well, my goodness, I used to help my mother dye rugs

10:44.110 --> 10:53.443
and, I mean, rags, make rugs out of. Yeah. And when 
we were at the ranch, we had a... excuse me, 14 by 16

11:01.885 --> 11:05.849
bedroom. Two double beds in it and a big stove, 
heater. And that's where we, and a cot. And we all

11:17.101 --> 11:20.664
slept in there because it's so cold. And we had 
single wall. Oh, that single wall construction.

11:27.892 --> 11:28.112
Absolutely. Papa put a big old green stick of wood 
in that heater or an old

11:28.936 --> 11:43.715
cedar log and get up and fire it up again in the night 
and kept it warm. And we kept warm. And we'd sleep in

11:46.719 --> 11:49.082
there. And Mama made a rug to cover that whole room 
and made it on a loom over here at Blanco. out of old

11:59.142 --> 12:00.584
rags. Old rags. And they were dyed in different 
colors, and she made

12:02.387 --> 12:08.696
striping. Yeah. And she used a lot of red, and it was 
pretty. Those kinds of things, if women had to do

12:16.407 --> 12:21.093
them today, they just wouldn't be able to handle a 
lot. No, they wouldn't do it. Boy, we knew better

12:22.655 --> 12:25.920
than to spill anything, get anything on that rug. 
Now, that was something. Mm-hmm. The survival of

12:30.428 --> 12:41.522
the family depended on the woman in most cases as 
far as being sure that everything was done. It

12:42.063 --> 12:43.725
wasn't a part of life. It wasn't, I hate to say this, 
a lot of people would disagree, but it wasn't an ERA

12:43.785 --> 12:50.774
fight between husband and wife. It was if one 
didn't do her share or his share, it wasn't done.

12:56.862 --> 12:59.085
And they're both laborious tasks. A lot of labor 
combined between both people to simply survive

12:59.639 --> 13:04.967
back then. Now, I want to tell you right now, I've 
seen my mother sit on a cultivator all day long and

13:05.067 --> 13:10.636
cook dinner. And when she'd go to the house to cook 
dinner, I'd get through hoeing at the end, and I'd

13:10.656 --> 13:20.972
get on the cultivator. And I'd make the rounds and 
come back. And then she'd come back and take it

13:24.967 --> 13:26.990
over. That cultivator didn't stop. Do you think 
today that you'd take a seven-year-old girl and

13:31.315 --> 13:39.626
put her on a cultivator driving a span of mules? 
Why? Oh, she'd get killed if something happened.

13:42.610 --> 13:43.932
Yeah. Yeah. But it wasn't that way. You had to do it 
to get the job done again. Why? Good night. Well,

13:52.272 --> 13:56.597
Ava, I think that that's the thing that I want 
people to hear about. Just keep going and tell me

13:57.778 --> 14:03.024
everything you can remember of value to you. Those 
things are worth more to me than anything that I can

14:03.044 --> 14:08.250
think of. Oh, of course. Now, I'm glad that we live 
in a time that the girls and the women didn't have to

14:11.354 --> 14:18.542
do it. But many a time... uh i drive four mules to a 
triple disc plow now you didn't have many crippled

14:21.550 --> 14:50.848
this plow in those days you had double discs but 
very few cripples yeah that's a hard one and that

14:21.550 --> 14:50.848
was that was a hard one to pull in a big one but we had 
um grandpa and uncle buddy and my daddy bought one

14:21.550 --> 14:50.848
together yeah and that's the way we we would share 
well all right tom you do yours first and then Jay,

14:51.554 --> 14:53.778
you take it. And then they'd all fly in and help 
Grandpa Chapman because he was older and no one to

14:53.798 --> 15:02.531
help him at that time. And the men would help. But 
Daddy would never let that thing stop. I would plow

15:14.487 --> 15:18.693
Margaret would plow, Mama would plow, and he would 
plow. My daddy had sciatic rheumatism and was to

15:18.794 --> 15:27.226
the point where he couldn't walk at all at one time. 
And they say it was from riding on that hard steel

15:27.887 --> 15:38.844
plow and jolting it and hurting it, whether it was 
or whether it wasn't. He and Mother made a cushion,

15:38.864 --> 15:42.790
but they didn't help. He just had sciatic nerve 
trouble and just couldn't do it. But anyway, we all

15:47.801 --> 15:51.474
worked at it. I wouldn't take for knowing how to 
drive up. for mules. It's something that you

15:57.484 --> 16:04.633
understand and something that's worth 
something. Now, no, it isn't worth anything. It

16:07.477 --> 16:13.385
may be, if things keep going like they're going, we 
may be back in the same old hill. My grandfather

16:13.425 --> 16:15.208
used to say that. My grandfather said that the day 
would come that we'd have everything. Come in!

16:23.038 --> 16:24.420
That it would all... Turn right around.

16:29.084 --> 16:30.146
We're doing some homework. The main thing that I 
appreciate my parents as much or more than

16:30.166 --> 16:39.744
anything was the routine that we had. Of course, we 
lived so far and had to ride the school horseback.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.071
Right. And open gates. But it wasn't on until we... 
learn to open gates by making a horse ride up to the

16:48.059 --> 16:59.361
gate and reaching over and undoing it and staying 
on the horse and closing the gate. But the

17:00.162 --> 17:08.498
responsibility of caring for that horse, get up 
and feed that horse before breakfast, And then the

17:08.663 --> 17:16.174
minute that breakfast was over, you go saddle that 
horse and bring it down here and tie it to the fence.

17:17.135 --> 17:21.341
Then put on your school clothes and mother will 
have your lunch ready and beat it. You get ready for

17:22.102 --> 17:23.324
school. When I say beat it, you didn't have any time 
to do anything. But every night you shucked that

17:28.812 --> 17:34.600
corn and you nubbed it. When I say nub it, you took 
every bit of it. off of the end of the ears, and you

17:38.313 --> 17:46.881
put it over here in a bucket, and you'd throw it out 
to the chickens. If there was any good there,

17:46.961 --> 17:51.346
they'd get it, and if it wasn't, it would make good 
manure. So out it went outside. But you shucked

17:54.469 --> 18:06.160
that corn at night for your hogs, your chickens, 
your turkeys, and your horse, and you put it in a

17:54.469 --> 18:06.160
box, but you nubbed every bit of it. You didn't feed 
a hog a bunch of old smutty corn and stuff like that.

18:12.948 --> 18:14.750
You fed him good stuff. And we had a grinder that you 
put your corn in, and they'd take it off of the cob

18:14.770 --> 18:26.087
and you'd grind it. You'd stack those cobs in a neat 
stack. Every night you took six cobs into the

18:31.604 --> 18:35.209
house. One of them you put in a can that had a little 
bit of kerosene in it that you would put in to start

18:36.211 --> 18:48.049
the fire the next morning. And then you used three 
or four, as Kenley liked to, under your wood, split

18:48.690 --> 18:56.842
wood, to start your fire. But that was routine, and 
if that wasn't done, then mother and dad called you

19:00.798 --> 19:11.254
in and you really got a good little spanking. And I 
mean, it was bridal reins and it hurt. And you knew

19:16.002 --> 19:17.364
better. And you understood that it was something 
that you had to do. And you milked the cows, you

19:21.511 --> 19:27.480
gathered the eggs, you shut the chickens up, Then 
you came in, washed your hands, ate your supper,

19:28.355 --> 19:34.183
and got your lessons. It wasn't come in and sit down 
and watch television and play. No, sir. There was

19:39.110 --> 19:40.452
work to do. And you did it. And then, well, all me 
alive, I was milking cows when I was five years old.

19:50.006 --> 19:54.312
And I can prove that by anybody that knows me in this 
country. Show me a five-year-old kid they're

19:55.085 --> 19:59.535
getting a cow pen now with a bunch of cows. That's 
right. They're scared they're going to get

20:00.237 --> 20:02.041
stepped on. They're afraid, and they don't trust 
their children. They give them no

20:05.810 --> 20:08.396
responsibility. And what is wrong? Adults don't 
trust children. What's wrong with the world today

20:12.365 --> 20:17.370
is they have no confidence in their children. Oh, I 
don't want him to have to work like I did. Listen,

20:20.252 --> 20:22.034
that's wrong. He needs that responsibility. He 
needs to know where that dollar came from. He needs

20:30.542 --> 20:33.945
to understand that he doesn't grow on trees.

20:36.987 --> 20:40.971
How many times have I come to town on Saturday and 
feed cotton, bales of cotton up, gin down here. Rub

20:47.715 --> 20:51.498
that old gin thing around in a bale of cotton. Let it 
suck it up. Just a kid. Oh, no. Oh, that thing had

20:56.363 --> 20:58.265
sucked that child up. It had hurt it. It had killed 
it. It had knocked it down. That was the way it was.

21:04.251 --> 21:04.691
That was survival. That was life. That was life. 
That was life. and pick up peach seeds and take them

21:09.352 --> 21:13.076
to town and sell them. Wash medicine bottles and 
take them to the drug store and sell them. For a

21:21.043 --> 21:21.904
penny. That's right. That's the way we'd get our 
spending money. Really? Would a kid do that today?

21:28.070 --> 21:28.130
No. He wouldn't pick up peach seeds and wash them 
off and put them in a box and go sell them. No. That's

21:37.786 --> 21:39.048
right. No, they wouldn't. No, they wouldn't. They 
may pick up a beer can. They may pick up a soda water

21:44.176 --> 21:50.185
can, but we didn't even have soda water.

21:50.385 --> 21:50.606
Right. That's valuable to me, Ava. I agree with 
times have changed so much, and kids are cheated.

21:59.251 --> 22:05.518
Children are really cheated out of the 
responsibility that they could assume when

21:59.251 --> 22:05.518
they're little bitty and growing. You know, they 
could be doing things that make them pleased with

22:05.799 --> 22:10.905
themselves. Children are cheated in more ways 
than one. It's true. I was brought up in a time and

22:15.250 --> 22:21.397
the age that little folks were seen and not heard. 
But we had ears and we listened. And we learned. We

22:31.505 --> 22:32.326
learned. We were not sent to our room unless we 
misbehaved and didn't listen while they were

22:32.826 --> 22:39.396
talking. Then we were sent to our room. But we could 
sit there, and I'm telling you, I wasn't 12 years

22:42.901 --> 22:52.815
old, and I know it. And I would sit in the room and 
listen to Uncle Clarence Martin, who was district

22:53.977 --> 23:03.090
judge and district prosecuting attorney and all 
that for this country. And Uncle Sam was in the

23:03.110 --> 23:06.034
legislature. And my daddy was just a rancher. But 
they would talk over politics of what's happening

23:09.599 --> 23:15.527
in the world. As I said, we had no newspaper. But 
they were in the towns where they could get the

23:17.971 --> 23:22.397
news. Well, I knew who was governor. I knew who was 
our congressman. I will grant you, right today,

23:30.960 --> 23:42.330
you can walk downtown and pick out any bunch of kids 
you want to, unless they're in high school. They

23:43.491 --> 23:48.455
couldn't tell you who was even governor of Texas or 
who was president. They care less. That's true.

23:52.786 --> 23:55.670
But they can tell you what Mickey Mouse is doing. 
Yeah, that's true. What Michael Jackson's doing.

24:00.318 --> 24:01.479
That's what they can tell you. Yes. And their 
greatest ambition in life is to get to sin. That's

24:06.447 --> 24:07.048
right. Instead of valuing their own individual 
self, and growing because they know what it means

24:15.128 --> 24:19.034
to learn and grow. They haven't been taught. Kids 
haven't been taught how to learn and grow. And the

24:23.340 --> 24:44.511
thing I can remember, I guess, the most at that 
particular time was the greatest event and joy

24:23.340 --> 24:44.511
that I had

24:23.340 --> 24:44.511
was when Teddy Roosevelt came through Austin with 
his Rough Riders going to going to the border.

24:49.190 --> 24:49.451
Yeah. Do you know that my daddy and Uncle Sam loaded 
us up in an old Model T car? Took us five hours to go

24:58.162 --> 25:07.834
from here to Austin in that Model T. And every creek 
we stopped, we had to fill it up with water. It'd

25:09.035 --> 25:09.957
boil out. It'd be so hot. The roads were so rough. No 
pavement. Not even a good wagon road, hardly. And

25:18.955 --> 25:22.744
jolt, oh, that's the roughest riding thing. You 
really needed spurs to stay in it. But we got there,

25:27.053 --> 25:31.744
and...

25:32.855 --> 25:34.537
We stayed at the Cabinets House. The Cabinets, 
yes. You know where that is. That's right. We

25:40.305 --> 25:42.608
stayed at the Cabinets House. And I believe that 
that avenue was the most beautiful thing I ever saw

25:42.628 --> 25:47.454
in my life. You know, the post used to go right up the 
center of the street and had the lights in a diamond

25:47.995 --> 25:55.705
shape. And they lit them up. And I had never seen 
electric lights like that. Oh, yeah. All the

26:04.615 --> 26:15.690
lights that I had ever seen had been a carbide light 
that was up at Uncle Clarence's, other than a

26:04.615 --> 26:15.690
kerosene light like we had never seen electric 
light. I didn't know what one looked like. And when

26:19.756 --> 26:25.103
I saw those beautiful lights, I just stopped. 
still just dead still and I asked my daddy what they

26:26.281 --> 26:48.964
were because they were in colors red white and blue 
and he told me now you can imagine what what a great

26:26.281 --> 26:48.964
big old girl I thought about first time she'd ever 
seen electric yeah And I thought that was the most

26:50.277 --> 26:53.982
wonderful thing that ever was. Well, Uncle Sam 
took us to the Capitol, showed us where his seat

26:54.043 --> 27:07.222
was, showed us the chamber and the legislature, 
all about it, explained it to us. And we knew, of

27:08.464 --> 27:12.049
course. come back. And I'm telling you, Uncle 
Clarence Martin then bought us all a pair of new

27:13.184 --> 27:20.152
shoes. And it's patent leather. I'll tell you, 
what was that? Well, it's a Jew store there on 6th

27:27.500 --> 27:30.164
Street. Not Scarborough's, was it? No, not 
Scarborough's. Scarborough's was on the Avenue

27:32.987 --> 27:36.131
then. Oh, on 6th Street. Oh, Gilliman's. 
Gilliman's. Okay, I've seen that one. Yeah,

27:41.678 --> 27:44.366
Gilliman's on Fifth Street. And we went in there, 
and just above Gilliman was Joe Cohen, a jeweler.

27:52.108 --> 27:52.228
Right. And he bought Margaret and I a little ring, 
and James, Eddie, and Lyndon a ring. Now, I don't

27:58.567 --> 28:03.994
know why in the world Rebecca and Joseph are at 
Lyndon's sister's. I think because Aunt Rebecca

28:04.014 --> 28:07.900
didn't want them to go, but we went to Lyndon. And I 
don't really know, but they never did associate

28:08.761 --> 28:14.469
with us in doing things like that. And he bought us 
all a little ring at Joe Cohen's. Yeah, that's the

28:17.639 --> 28:19.682
prettiest thing he ever looked at. But anyway, he 
bought us patent leather shoes. And mine was black

28:23.147 --> 28:26.171
with white tops. And Marv's was black with red 
tops, kid's skin tops. And we'd walk up and down

28:32.260 --> 28:36.526
that pavement. And Lennon's was black patent 
leather with,

28:36.707 --> 28:44.638
well, they were lace shoes. Uh-huh. Not worthy or 
worthy button. I believe his is button. I believe

28:52.504 --> 28:54.126
his is button shoes. I believe James Ealy's is 
button. They both rather have the buttons than the

28:55.988 --> 28:59.092
lace because they come undone. And I believe they 
both had button shoes. Well, anyway, we walked on

29:02.696 --> 29:08.503
up to...

29:09.226 --> 29:11.812
What was that big old drugstore up there? Oh. Oh. 
Just sure look. I know. It was an old keep. Not

29:20.691 --> 29:21.493
King's. Well, I can't think of it right now, but 
anyway. Where was it about a... Up above

29:26.810 --> 29:28.031
Scarborough. Up above, yeah, I know. That great 
big drugstore. Great big drugstore. And we went up

29:32.116 --> 29:35.841
there and stayed at this drugstore for a while. And 
he told the man he was going to go see something,

29:35.921 --> 29:43.109
somebody on up further. And he went to the counter 
and he says, feed those kids all the ice cream or

29:43.590 --> 29:50.978
anything they want to drink and let them sit here. 
Well, boy, we filled up. Don't think we didn't. We

29:55.447 --> 30:00.094
ate ice cream and Lennon got a banana split. Of 
course, we'd never seen a banana split and didn't

30:00.334 --> 30:03.679
know what one was like. And oh my goodness, when 
they brought that out to Lennon, well, I'll never

30:04.861 --> 30:09.208
forget. He ate every bit of it, but he'd already 
eaten a big bowl of ice cream. And poor little fella

30:17.120 --> 30:20.204
really got sick. He just got too... much and it was 
too hot a day and he really got sick and he said well

30:22.784 --> 30:42.885
and oh and he says now i'm going down and then i'll 
tom will pick you up that is my daddy will pick you up

30:22.784 --> 30:42.885
and so daddy came by and picked us up. And he said, 
well, I want to go down to Leonard E.'s wagon yard

30:45.844 --> 30:57.978
and see how much they're paying for turkeys and 
chickens, because I've got to bring them down next

30:45.844 --> 30:57.978
week or two to market. And so we walked on from 
wherever this drug store was, which is way up above

30:58.838 --> 31:08.569
Scarborough's and is up above Woolworth's. Any 
other time I could think of. I know. I can see it from

31:12.940 --> 31:15.950
the pictures I remember. But I can't tell you. But 
anyway, and women say, well. It's a good history.
