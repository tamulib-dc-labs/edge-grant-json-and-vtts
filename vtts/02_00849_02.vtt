WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:04.811
And I always felt that it was extremely romantic.

00:08.255 --> 00:11.739
What activities exactly were they both involved 
in in the community? Well, my mother was a

00:11.759 --> 00:20.590
prominent artist in this area, and she belonged to 
the Women's Club, which she was always very proud

00:11.759 --> 00:20.590
of. The Women's Club to her was an especially 
festive occasion, and it is the last thing she gave

00:20.630 --> 00:31.202
up. once its vice president. She was very active in 
church work, and so was my father. She taught a

00:39.441 --> 00:44.247
Sunday school class and went to church every 
Sunday till long late in life. And I remember quite

00:44.267 --> 00:54.238
distinctly her discussing the problem of going to 
church with one of my younger sons, who thought he

00:44.267 --> 00:54.238
didn't need to go to church. And he said to her, he 
said, well, you don't go to church. And she said, I

00:58.163 --> 01:01.527
have been. That's great. How many were in your 
family? My mother and father had five children.

01:07.253 --> 01:11.920
Are they living in this area, too? Yes, two of my 
sisters, too, and my brother. I've lost one

01:16.926 --> 01:25.017
brother, and the rest of them do live around

01:16.926 --> 01:25.017
here. You told me your mother was involved in the 
women's club. What exactly activities were they

01:30.528 --> 01:34.493
involved in? Well, those ladies have spent their 
whole history in contributing to the cultural

01:35.014 --> 01:47.731
activities of the community. The library for 
instance is their They have, over the years, given

01:53.617 --> 02:02.585
us thousands and thousands of dollars to the 
library, and they continue to do so. They have

02:04.607 --> 02:20.963
brought the best speakers and artists that they 
could to the club, paid them well, so that people in

02:04.607 --> 02:20.963
the community might have the privilege of 
listening to

02:04.607 --> 02:20.963
them. You mentioned your mother was an artist. 
drawings did she do? She did everything.

02:26.470 --> 02:29.653
Portraits and flowers and landscapes. I often 
think that her, the best thing she did were flower

02:31.154 --> 02:36.540
portraits. She did a blue bike picture which is as 
big as that wall over there. My goodness. I love it.

02:43.506 --> 02:44.427
I own now. And she, my father the night she died was 
was telling how she painted and how—well, I

02:52.409 --> 03:03.865
remembered it's a—in the distance, you see this 
little country road, and in the distance you can

02:52.409 --> 03:03.865
see the church and the courthouse in Anderson, 
Texas. Well, they sat on stools in that road, and

03:04.646 --> 03:14.240
she painted all day and however long it

03:04.646 --> 03:14.240
took her to do it. That's great. Did she do oil 
painting? Yes, she painted in oil. She painted all

03:20.236 --> 03:24.503
in watercolor with two mediums she used, and 
charcoal. Were these available when she was

03:25.404 --> 03:31.433
younger and drawing, or when did she start this, 
when she was young? I asked her once, and she said

03:31.453 --> 03:38.965
she could not remember when she was not drawing and

03:31.453 --> 03:38.965
painting. That's great. Do you draw yourself? I 
couldn't draw a straight line if I had to, nor can I

03:41.128 --> 03:47.458
open a can. Did she sell a number of these paintings 
over the years?

03:54.883 --> 03:55.143
Yes, she did. That's great. There are a lot of her 
works, and she did a series of portraits of Texas

03:55.444 --> 04:08.476
heroes, and each of the schools named for one of 
those, that portrait is there. And she did some

04:08.516 --> 04:16.163
pictures for various churches, Baptist 
churches, baptismal scenes. Which do you feel is

04:17.408 --> 04:19.270
her most famous? Was it this one with the blue 
bonnet? Yes. Everybody's always simply startled

04:22.934 --> 04:25.796
at that picture. That's great. What were your 
parents' names? I don't believe I have their

04:29.981 --> 04:32.263
names. My mother's name was Mary Martin Adams, and 
my father was George Ernest Adams.

04:45.997 --> 04:46.097
Okay. Okay. And you are married too, is that 
correct? Yes. How did you meet your husband? I met

04:53.055 --> 04:55.478
him during the war at A&M. Was he a student here at 
A&M? No, he was stationed here at that time. I see.

05:02.666 --> 05:05.210
Was there a military base here? Yes, at A&M. At A&M, 
I see. Was it an Army base? This particular branch

05:12.799 --> 05:15.462
that he belonged to was Of

05:16.370 --> 05:21.796
course, we had everything here during the war, you 
know. Oh, I didn't know that. Yes, you did. The

05:25.420 --> 05:30.486
Navy, the Air Force, they were all here. Bryan 
Airfield was here. That's right,

05:32.468 --> 05:37.293
that's right. That was used, I guess, well, let's 
see, that was an Air Force field, or was that? That

05:44.838 --> 05:49.524
property now belongs to Texas A&M University. But 
it was previously an air base? Air base.

05:55.692 --> 06:00.638
Travis Bryan, Sr. was instrumental in getting it 
here. I guess then a lot of the people in this area

06:01.779 --> 06:13.714
were affected by the war and I guess were

06:01.779 --> 06:13.714
called into service, is that correct? Was your 
husband, I guess, did he go overseas too? Yes.

06:28.919 --> 06:31.543
What does your husband do now? Oh, he's a 
university professor. Oh, I didn't know that. In

06:34.707 --> 06:36.269
which department? In philosophy.

06:43.073 --> 06:45.958
And I guess he enjoys this community as much as you 
do, right? Well, he doesn't live here anymore. Oh,

06:47.741 --> 06:48.542
I see.

06:59.139 --> 06:59.240
Okay. Let me see. How did you, I guess you told me 
both of your parents, I guess especially your

06:59.500 --> 07:06.932
father was involved in a lot of political. Yes, he 
was. Involvements and things. Served several

07:09.415 --> 07:12.218
terms in the Texas legislature. He was mayor of 
Bryan twice. He was on the school board a number of

07:14.501 --> 07:17.665
times.

07:20.789 --> 07:24.413
I guess you're quite proud of him. Yes. I was 
amazed. All my life I thought all this bit about

07:28.538 --> 07:37.228
public service, which my mother and father seemed 
to be so involved in, was a rather thankless

07:38.491 --> 07:43.579
proposition, but I think people really 
appreciate them. More people than ever came to

07:44.461 --> 07:47.846
anybody's funeral came to theirs. And I'm still 
getting letters from people I never knew or heard

07:48.748 --> 08:00.127
of saying how much they appreciate what they have 
done for this community. Were you active in his

08:02.470 --> 08:05.515
campaigning for mayor here in the community? No. I 
wasn't in here. I don't know where I was. Oh, that's

08:10.343 --> 08:13.307
something. When was he mayor here in Bryan?

08:19.457 --> 08:21.901
I guess in the, I think in the 1950s. 1950. Okay. Do 
you know possibly what the main issues were then,

08:29.690 --> 08:38.882
or the main problems in Bryan that, you know, he 
was, I'm sure had some ideas of things he wanted to

08:29.690 --> 08:38.882
change here, maybe, you know? Well, he was always 
particularly interested in education, because

08:39.383 --> 08:45.972
he started out life as a school teacher. And he 
always hoped that one of his children would be a

08:48.075 --> 08:53.783
school teacher, but none of them turned out to be. I 
taught school for six months. Oh my, that's

08:55.785 --> 08:58.549
something. Did you teach in school after you 
graduated then, before you became a librarian?

09:06.454 --> 09:06.714
That's great. I taught in this little town out here 
called Iowa. Iowa. Which still exists. Where is

09:14.426 --> 09:16.610
that located? Well, it's out that way. Okay.

09:22.880 --> 09:27.507
When was that that you taught there?

09:28.027 --> 09:29.809
It was in the early 1930s.

09:32.971 --> 09:35.994
That's something. What did you teach in 
elementary school? Taught fifth grade. That's

09:40.338 --> 09:43.660
great.

09:47.163 --> 09:57.072
Did you feel at any time, or did you feel in the 
limelight when your dad was, when your father was

09:47.163 --> 09:57.072
mayor here, or did any of the children Are your 
fellow friends envy you? I don't think so. You

10:01.419 --> 10:08.228
don't think

10:01.419 --> 10:08.228
so? That's interesting.

10:14.837 --> 10:23.329
What kind of—let's

10:14.837 --> 10:23.329
see, were there any particular holidays or 
celebrations here in Bryan besides the

10:24.473 --> 10:32.763
traditional holidays that they celebrated 
during that year? Any particular, did they have

10:33.223 --> 10:43.075
any like parades or

10:33.223 --> 10:43.075
fairs maybe? Well they used to a long time ago have 
fairs every year. Like a county fair? Yes. I don't

10:51.740 --> 10:53.342
believe they do anymore. I can't remember the 
period of any time lately.

11:00.630 --> 11:01.050
Right. Did you ever go to them here? Yes. What were 
they like? Do they show livestock? Oh, lots of

11:06.316 --> 11:07.337
them. They show livestock and things

11:08.819 --> 11:18.770
like that? Yes. What did Dad feel about you 
becoming a librarian? Was he— Well, he was a

11:22.567 --> 11:25.550
gribble. Gribble. Yeah. I taught my mother into 
talking into the assembly library school.

11:32.839 --> 11:36.423
Everything went through her. I see.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.883
Did you do a lot of reading? What stimulated you 
into becoming a librarian? Was that part of it?

11:50.049 --> 11:50.429
Yes. Or did you spend yourself a lot of time in the 
library here? Yes. I spent all my time in the

11:54.613 --> 12:04.622
library

11:54.613 --> 12:04.622
here.

12:06.884 --> 12:09.726
How did they work that with checking out books in 
those days? Did they do it the same as they do now?

12:13.925 --> 12:35.275
When they first began the library over there, you 
had a library card, and when you checked out a book,

12:13.925 --> 12:35.275
the library had a stamp, and she stamped your book, 
either the, I don't remember whether they stamped

12:13.925 --> 12:35.275
it the day you took it out, or the day you were to 
bring it back. I think they stamped it the day you

12:35.315 --> 12:39.942
took it out, and then when they brought it back, 
they stamped it again. I see. And did you have a

12:42.443 --> 12:44.826
certain time you could keep the book out? Yes. I 
believe they both circulated for two weeks. Now

12:50.111 --> 12:54.356
they circulate for three. Three weeks. How did you 
happen to get your position here at the library,

12:54.636 --> 12:59.622
your present position now? Well, I was working in 
the Detroit Public Library at the time, and I

13:01.784 --> 13:09.092
looked at a professional journal. I just casually 
saw that they were leaving the library in Bryan, so

13:09.983 --> 13:15.508
I applied for the job. That's great. And when was 
that, that you applied? I guess it was in the 1960s.

13:26.838 --> 13:27.999
I've been here fifteen years. Fifteen years. 
That's great. And where were you before you were in

13:31.242 --> 13:34.145
Detroit?

13:37.188 --> 13:37.628
Detroit Public. Are these people here while you 
were away? Yes.

13:45.790 --> 13:50.876
Okay.

13:50.896 --> 13:58.825
Did your brothers or sisters—did your brothers go 
to A&M here when they grew up and went to A&M? Yes,

13:58.845 --> 14:00.307
they both. What was their major field of interest 
there? My older brother was an engineer. He helped

14:07.898 --> 14:12.583
build the Alcon Highway in Alaska. Oh, my. I have a 
wonderful book with pictures of him and all the

14:13.524 --> 14:17.308
work that they did. My younger brother went into 
agriculture.

14:24.375 --> 14:25.757
When was this highway built? During World War II. 
During World War II?

14:34.886 --> 14:35.627
That's great. Did they ever regret not having 
women at the university? Oh, no. They thought the

14:40.748 --> 14:43.472
main deal was to have it all men. To all men.

14:48.419 --> 14:55.569
It remained for my niece, who was my brother's 
daughter, to make a test case.

15:00.656 --> 15:01.497
Well... My younger brother said that she ought to 
be put in a convent. Oh, that's something.

15:12.398 --> 15:21.413
What activities, did a lot of the boys go out of town 
to see their girlfriends during those times since

15:12.398 --> 15:21.413
there weren't girls here? Yes, they did. Every 
weekend they went to see their women. So I guess the

15:25.519 --> 15:29.205
place kind of was deserted during that time? 
T.W.U., which was called C.I.A. then, you know.

15:33.686 --> 15:34.747
What did that stand for? College of Industrial 
Arts. Oh, I see. It's at Denton. It's now called

15:39.533 --> 15:41.175
Texas University. Right. So a lot of them would go 
up there. Did a lot of the fellows have cars during

15:45.480 --> 15:51.987
that time to take them around or to get to places, 
or? Some of them did, but you know, now they all do.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.496
Right. What

16:00.269 --> 16:23.264
do you think has

16:00.269 --> 16:23.264
been your greatest satisfaction of living here in 
Bryan? Being a librarian. Being a librarian.

16:27.129 --> 16:27.610
That's great. Oh,

16:29.277 --> 16:45.601
when was it that your parents died? Can you tell me 
that? They've been dead, um, six years. Six years.

17:00.513 --> 17:12.126
Was your father in any other organizations, 
community organizations, before he became

17:00.513 --> 17:12.126
mayor, besides, you know, being involved so much 
with the university? You know, I mean, like amends

17:13.267 --> 17:19.113
organizations here in Ryan, or do you know? Well, 
he was a Rotarian. He's very much devoted to that

17:22.137 --> 17:26.942
organization. And what were their activities or 
are their activities? They're a civic

17:33.158 --> 17:36.743
organization. They're very powerful and 
influential

17:36.864 --> 17:54.111
in the

17:36.864 --> 17:54.111
community.

17:56.808 --> 18:12.082
Do you think that, um, do you feel that people were 
more politically involved in, in their

17:56.808 --> 18:12.082
government, maybe here in Vine, or in the local 
area, than people are today, do you think? No. No?

18:13.203 --> 18:13.263
No. I think people are, in this area, are extremely 
interested in their government.

18:21.050 --> 18:21.250
All right. Uh,

18:21.270 --> 18:25.954
can you think of any of the or maybe a problem in 
Bryan that was of particular interest to a lot of

18:27.183 --> 18:42.780
the people during your time that, you know, was 
maybe controversial or anything? No, I suppose

18:43.200 --> 18:50.608
the greatest controversy in my time has been a 
debate over whether the school board should be

18:51.415 --> 18:59.767
elected or appointed, and they finally decided to 
elect it. For a long time, I believe it was the only

19:01.249 --> 19:08.178
such situation in the state of Texas. So they were 
appointed? They used to be appointed.

19:17.932 --> 19:18.773
I see, I see.

19:31.375 --> 20:00.353
What

19:31.375 --> 20:00.353
do you think is has been your greatest joy as far as 
being a citizen here in Bryan? Being the

20:09.490 --> 20:10.271
librarian. Being the librarian. That's great. 
How long have you been the head librarian here?

20:18.479 --> 20:18.999
Fifteen years. Fifteen years.

20:24.465 --> 20:27.448
That's great. Were you a librarian in Detroit 
before you came here? Yes.

20:34.454 --> 20:48.565
I

20:34.454 --> 20:48.565
don't think I've got any more questions.
