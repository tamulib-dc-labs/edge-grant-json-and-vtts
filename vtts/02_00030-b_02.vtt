WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:14.206
I think it was on Channel 25, and I doubt if they even 
had a center pole that was very long, but it did have

00:02.022 --> 00:14.206
a real privy on top of it somewhere. Am I correct 
that one of the key parts of A&M Spirit is being

00:14.647 --> 00:23.946
inclusive of everybody That's, at a, to draw the 
whole group together. Yeah, well it's just, I

00:27.752 --> 00:42.358
think athletic events had a lot to do with that and 
the selection of core leaders from one year to the

00:27.752 --> 00:42.358
next meant a lot. Do you remember your senior final 
review and commencement? I don't remember much

00:49.542 --> 00:55.209
about my commencement, but I do remember my final 
review. I don't even remember where the

00:55.449 --> 00:57.491
commencement was. I remember my commissioning 
exercises. Where were they held? Guyon? I think it

01:03.799 --> 01:05.160
was in Guyon Hall. Were there any celebrities that 
came to visit A&M while you were an undergraduate?

01:15.563 --> 01:22.693
It seemed to me like one of the presidents came for a 
short visit, but I don't remember who it was. But no

01:22.974 --> 01:24.456
movie stars? No, not that I can recall. And the big 
bands weren't coming through yet, were they? No.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.189
We didn't have anything like that, Opus. And the 
MSC was a great blessing when it was built.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.063
Alright, so now let's move forward. You go away and 
teach, World War II comes, and then you come back

01:43.463 --> 01:52.136
here as a member of the professional staff in 1945. 
Describe how that came about, please. Well, we'll

01:58.464 --> 01:59.666
get there. In other words, you want to leave the 
student thing? I got out of— Don't forget Noel

02:03.732 --> 02:09.820
Rollins. I said, don't forget when you start that 
to mention Doe Rollins was the causer for coming

02:10.863 --> 02:17.995
here. Excuse me, but I don't. I was discharged from 
Fort Hood on 25 September. But I wasn't discharged

02:27.552 --> 02:36.433
until January the 20th because I had maximum leave 
left from overseas. So I was over in East Texas

02:36.453 --> 02:44.211
tearing down my old family home. and building a 
small, comfortable house for my mother. My father

02:49.077 --> 02:52.142
passed away while I was overseas. And the Red Cross 
said they'd send me home if I wanted to, and I said,

02:53.104 --> 03:02.740
well, then I'll go hold a service until I get there, 
and I'll have to turn around and come back. Just

03:02.720 --> 03:06.225
tell them that I can't come." And I was over there 
building the house, a little house for her. And Doe

03:11.211 --> 03:29.115
Rollins was the first dean of student affairs that 
was selected, and he was at Luke's Grocery Store at

03:11.211 --> 03:29.115
the East Gate one afternoon buying groceries, and 
ran into Dr. Ed Williams, who was my department

03:11.211 --> 03:29.115
head. I sent in some rare hardwood while I was 
overseas and still had a piece of it on his counter,

03:29.618 --> 03:37.613
and he said, you're back, you can have it. And they 
were together over there, and Mr. Rollins said,

03:38.816 --> 03:49.416
Ed, I'm trying to put a staff together for the 
Student Affairs Department because the World War

03:38.816 --> 03:49.416
veterans are coming back. And do you know anybody 
that might be interested?" And he knew that he's

03:54.687 --> 03:58.233
the only person that knew where I was. I was going 
back to my school in February, to my old job, and

03:58.814 --> 04:07.270
this letter. He said, I know one person that might 
be interested. I said, well, where is he? He said,

04:12.498 --> 04:15.183
he's in East Texas building a house for his mother. 
He said, well, will you give me his address so I can

04:16.325 --> 04:19.930
get in touch with him? He said, under one 
condition, tell me how much you're going to pay

04:21.052 --> 04:27.182
him. Said, I'll pay him $300 a month and give him a 
house on campus with all utilities paid for $19. So

04:35.532 --> 04:42.961
Doe contacted me over there, and it was the middle 
of the week, and they were playing Baylor here that

04:35.532 --> 04:42.961
weekend. He said, come over and join me for the 
Baylor game, and we'll talk about it. And that was

04:48.428 --> 04:53.293
in late October, and I started working for him 
first of November. He had only two people on his

04:54.995 --> 04:57.118
staff And Woody Varner, who was a cadet colonel 
when he was a senior. Durwood T. Varner? Durwood

05:03.788 --> 05:04.488
Varner. Did you know him? Was the assistant dean. 
And Benny Zinn was aboard, but he was doing the

05:07.652 --> 05:15.681
veteran's work there and later would come to 
student affairs. And he said, we need four or five

05:16.702 --> 05:22.968
people for my staff. Fred Somebody. Huh? Fred 
Somebody was... in that department? Fred

05:29.625 --> 05:30.887
Hickman. Fred Hickman. Fred Hickman was the 
campus security officer. And Roy Bucek was with us

05:34.733 --> 05:42.125
for a while, and Jimmy Williams was with us for a 
while. He was the manager of the Cowboy. Anyway, we

05:45.150 --> 05:48.556
started to work the first of November. Woody 
Varner. Huh? That's another one. Woody Varner.

05:51.961 --> 05:52.282
Yeah. Well, I don't know. You mentioned him. Okay. 
I worked in the Cadet Corps as a counselor for two

05:55.908 --> 05:59.894
years. And where did your office in those days? I 
was in Dormitory 9 and had so many dormitories to

06:03.860 --> 06:09.989
look after. And Cadet Corps then was at the low end. 
And being over there two years, they said, you

06:17.963 --> 06:30.698
being in the National Guard, I don't think it would 
be out of the ordinary to ask you to wear a uniform to

06:17.963 --> 06:30.698
work. I said, well, one night a week in the National 
Guard is enough for my uniform, because I'd been in

06:31.859 --> 06:37.786
over four years. And I said, find me something else 
to do. So they sent me to Prairie Hall. I stayed

06:44.674 --> 06:45.996
there 12 years. and worked with civilian students 
and married students. And don't regret it at all

06:51.267 --> 06:58.755
because it was an uphill pull in the cadet corps in 
those days. Back to this, to create this student

06:59.616 --> 07:07.524
affairs area, do you have any idea whose idea that 
was? I'm trying to see who was president at the

07:09.346 --> 07:12.049
time. Was it Gilchrist or Bolton or Harrington? I 
don't remember who the president was. I thought it

07:18.797 --> 07:19.899
was Williams. Huh? I thought Mr. Williams, sort 
of. D.W. Williams? Not D.W., the one, the other

07:23.689 --> 07:25.854
Williams. Jack Williams? They had the fat wife. I 
don't remember who was the president, but I think

07:30.070 --> 07:51.847
it was decided that we need some type of organized 
effort to help the World War II veterans, because

07:30.070 --> 07:51.847
they pulled corps classes out, and they would come 
back as commissioned officers, and some of them

07:30.070 --> 07:51.847
non-commissioned officers, and they didn't want 
to go back to cadet corps. A few of them did, and they

07:51.867 --> 07:55.032
were the biggest problems. We just had a straight 
cadet, and then they branched off from that and

07:55.973 --> 08:06.309
made an office for veterans' education. Taylor 
Wilkins, who was on my basketball squad a year

08:07.150 --> 08:22.673
behind me, was a veteran advisor, and somebody to 
help them with everything they needed,

08:07.150 --> 08:22.673
particularly academic And your civilian student 
advising, that began when? About two years. I was

08:30.257 --> 08:33.121
in the cadet corps about two years. That would be 
45, 46, 47. I moved to Prairie Hall and stayed there

08:37.489 --> 08:45.402
until I terminated my services with the 
Department of Student Affairs. And by this time,

08:47.665 --> 08:49.909
by 47, the veterans are living all over the south 
end of the campus, aren't they? That's right. And

08:57.507 --> 09:06.761
World War II was gone, Vietnam had come in, Korean 
veterans had come in, and they were a different

08:57.507 --> 09:06.761
class of kittens. They didn't know one way to do 
something, and that's the way they wanted to do it.

09:15.554 --> 09:19.339
The World War II veterans, many of them were 
married, What did their wives do? They couldn't

09:22.134 --> 09:24.716
take classes in the nine months. Did they work? 
Well, some of the wives worked. They had a whole

09:29.040 --> 09:37.568
project right where the parking lot is now between 
the television station and the back of G. Riley

09:29.040 --> 09:37.568
Way. They called it Vet Village with prefab 
houses. Well, you know where Vet Village is, don't

09:42.713 --> 09:47.537
you? problems did you, as a counselor-advisor, 
what kind of problems did those World War II

09:48.192 --> 09:53.902
veterans have? Most of it was financial. Some of it 
was marital problems, because they'd been away.

10:02.777 --> 10:05.061
And just no two days alike. Now, they were mature. 
They'd been to the other side of the world. And they

10:12.593 --> 10:20.445
had this philosophy of the only thing to do 
something is the way I want to do it. That was the

10:20.465 --> 10:22.268
biggest obstacle. And we were close enough to them 
being in charge of their dormitory, they had to

10:23.530 --> 10:38.432
start a resignation procedure with the 
counselor's office. And I mentioned this one in

10:38.564 --> 10:42.488
that story in the magazine. I was in Walton Hall at 
the time for a short period of time, and a pre-vet

10:43.549 --> 10:52.819
student came in. In fact, he was maybe in his first 
or second year. He said, I've got to resign. And I

10:57.924 --> 11:01.608
said, well, is there any way we can keep him from 
resigning? He said, I just can't make my finances

11:02.569 --> 11:05.432
be. And he was a little older than every boy. And I 
had a dormitory supervisor job. We called them

11:13.607 --> 11:15.249
housemasters then. They got something else for 
them now, opening for $35 a month. They helped with

11:20.755 --> 11:25.461
the dormitory at night and delivered the personal 
mail to them. Not U.S. mail, but campus mail. And I

11:29.146 --> 11:32.770
said, well, would $35 a month help you? He said, I 
could see that it would help if I had a $35 job. So I

11:39.145 --> 11:40.988
made him a housemaster. And he finished his degree 
in veterinary medicine. And that's the person I

11:46.035 --> 11:49.920
didn't mention by name in this article. And he's 
now down at, I think, Katy or Paralanta,

11:50.741 --> 11:59.313
somewhere, as a veterinarian, been in business 
over 20 years. But I thought he'd see it and write

11:59.413 --> 12:03.499
it, but maybe he's forgotten it. But some of them 
had trouble making a study schedule. For

12:10.932 --> 12:24.036
instance, I had one from Nacogdoches that was 
coming in with some very poor grades at midterm, so

12:10.932 --> 12:24.036
that was what we looked at first to see what his 
grades were. And I called him in and I said, what

12:24.809 --> 12:29.776
seemed to be your problem? He says, well, maybe I'm 
not studying enough and not staying here enough.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.488
And I said, well, tell me your week's routine. He 
said, I go home Friday evening if I don't have any

12:37.528 --> 12:47.863
classes on Saturday and come back early Monday 
morning or late Sunday afternoon. And I said, in

12:47.843 --> 12:53.091
other words, he said, got a girlfriend I have to see 
every weekend. I said, you with her on Friday night

12:54.012 --> 12:59.280
and Saturday night, Sunday night. And Monday 
night, whether you're in class or not, you don't

13:00.902 --> 13:09.535
get over here in time to study and you sleep in class 
on Monday. And we figured it out. He was only

13:11.659 --> 13:13.782
studying two nights a week. So it salvaged him. He 
got him straightened out on a schedule and sat down

13:17.476 --> 13:26.865
and helped him make a steady schedule, because 
that's something some of them had never thought

13:17.476 --> 13:26.865
of. Were you part of the group that helped create 
the move of freshmen out to Bryan Field? Yes, I was

13:35.014 --> 13:39.458
the dean of students representative out there. 
Bob Melcher was the communist officer there.

13:44.510 --> 13:46.313
Whose idea was that? I never did know. Dr. 
Harrington, I think, was the first person out

13:50.301 --> 13:56.352
there as an academic dean. He only stayed one year, 
and Cliff Randall, I believe, followed him. They

14:01.081 --> 14:13.590
had everything out there a freshman needed, and 
they had over a thousand, except chemistry lab,

14:01.081 --> 14:13.590
machine shop labs, and labs of any significance. 
And they bussed them back in here on Saturday

14:13.690 --> 14:17.098
morning. They had their own dining hall, their own 
health center, their own

14:17.078 --> 14:29.157
library, their own student center. And a lot of the 
fellas didn't like it, and the upper class on

14:30.319 --> 14:39.433
campus didn't like it, because they thought this 
kind of segregated them. Well, in one way, there

14:40.134 --> 14:44.200
might have been, because their situation on the 
campus at that time was getting pretty rough. And I

14:47.285 --> 14:55.118
was, we were organized out there just like we were 
on the campus, but as a branch. Do you ever know

14:55.659 --> 14:57.642
Buford Hancock? No, sir. He's a horticulture 
graduate, a horticulture, retiring now. Oh, now I

15:02.430 --> 15:03.071
know. Yes, yes. He was a telephone orderly from 5 
o'clock on Friday afternoon until 8 o'clock on

15:04.244 --> 15:11.534
Monday morning. All the telephone calls went to 
his apartment, and he worked his way through

15:12.676 --> 15:19.365
school. As you look back on the Bryan Field effort, 
is there anything that A&M might have done to have

15:20.246 --> 15:31.421
done that better? How do you think that Under the 
circumstances,

15:33.877 --> 15:51.379
I don't believe they could have done it any better 
with what they had, because they had to use the old

15:33.877 --> 15:51.379
barracks and their old buildings for dining 
halls, and they had to use what structures were

15:33.877 --> 15:51.379
there, and they didn't have time to change it. And 
there were no other facilities available

15:52.186 --> 15:56.932
anywhere close, were there? That's right. The 
only thing that might have been improved, they

15:58.214 --> 16:14.153
might have had a little bit more dormitory 
supervision, because they tried to find a cadet, a

15:58.214 --> 16:14.153
freshman cadet who'd had a high school ROTC, and 
let him be a company commander. And they did that

16:15.595 --> 16:21.062
where they could, but they had some that were real 
oddballs. During this 12 years, your service with

16:21.498 --> 16:26.164
the university ends in what year? 1973.

16:31.311 --> 16:50.256
I had a period of five years between my work with the 
student affairs and my separation, because I left

16:31.311 --> 16:50.256
the department five years before I retired.

16:51.670 --> 16:55.534
Administratively, you reported to whom? I 
reported to the dean of students over here on

16:56.895 --> 17:02.982
affairs that pertained to us. And who was the first 
dean of students that you reported to? I think Doe

17:07.907 --> 17:13.072
Rollins, or Penn Bertha might have been the 
student. He might have been the dean at that time. I

17:15.554 --> 17:17.336
don't remember for sure. And you were 
responsible, what was the scope of your

17:17.356 --> 17:21.120
responsibility? anything that would pertain to 
supervision

17:21.505 --> 17:28.657
and control. What were the biggest headaches? 
Lacking supervision in the dormitory. Can you

17:37.031 --> 17:40.797
give some examples of some of the extreme 
problems? There was too many of them in one

17:41.350 --> 17:47.898
building there, and they wasn't getting as much 
studies as they needed. And it depended on the

17:49.200 --> 17:56.088
study conditions that were outlined by the group 
leaders. They might have had a squad leader that

17:56.388 --> 18:04.258
was a raw freshman, so they didn't have the study 
opportunities they had. But it saved an awful lot

18:05.259 --> 18:08.303
of kids. I hardly ever walked across the campus at a 
football game when somebody stops and says, you

18:08.283 --> 18:20.781
don't remember me, but I was at the annex when you 
were there, and you helped me do this, they helped

18:08.283 --> 18:20.781
me do that. And so we helped an awful lot of people 
that might have done better. I think, with more

18:25.748 --> 18:30.335
administrative help in the area. It could have 
been an upperclassman if he had been selected and

18:31.657 --> 18:40.249
did what they wanted him to do, like our dormitory 
supervisors over here. But I think they were

18:41.090 --> 18:46.498
afraid if they put a cadet out there, they'd be 
right back where they started. And you looked over

18:46.819 --> 18:49.663
both civilian Yeah, there was not many civilians. 
We had about, oh, probably three billion that were

18:52.976 --> 18:57.846
civilians. Had less trouble with them than did the 
cadet. When did it become optional for a student to

19:01.134 --> 19:07.247
drop out of the Corps after the sophomore year?

19:10.417 --> 19:11.578
I don't remember. I think it was often a long time 
ago that they had their two years of basic and did

19:11.598 --> 19:21.109
not have to get a contract. Now, not being 
compulsory, I don't remember those years. See,

19:26.435 --> 19:30.319
that's one of, I think, the best things that ever 
happened. The Corps were going to have to clean up

19:31.140 --> 19:35.645
some of their own problems. But you only took a 
contract when you were a junior, if you were

19:40.150 --> 19:42.913
qualified and wanted to commission. And there was 
a three-hour vacant spot in your curriculum to put

19:44.294 --> 19:49.419
your military sign. And now it's extra. You've got 
to go to summer school now to graduate in four

19:52.141 --> 19:55.124
years.

19:58.607 --> 20:09.938
Dr.

19:58.607 --> 20:09.938
Abbott came back to the campus as the chief 
academic officer and You didn't report to him,

20:10.694 --> 20:13.057
though? Other than just things that we need to keep 
up with each other. Yeah, he was, I believe he was

20:20.685 --> 20:23.208
the last person out there. When I got here in 1959, 
Dean Hannigan either was here or soon got here. Who

20:30.296 --> 20:32.980
was dean of students before him? Ransom. Cliff 
Ransom was in there for several years. Is that

20:38.067 --> 20:38.607
right? Cliff Ransdell. Who would later become 
Associate Dean of Engineering. That's right.

20:44.754 --> 20:50.560
Describe Dean Ransdell and his manner of 
leadership. Well, he put his self in it as if he was

20:51.181 --> 21:02.993
in the other person's place and tried to tried to 
fulfill their objective out there. And as far as

21:10.445 --> 21:26.340
academic qualifications, don't let him know 
this, I don't believe he had the academic

21:10.445 --> 21:26.340
qualifications that Harrington or Abbott had, 
but he did a good job. This man Rutter, when he was

21:27.861 --> 21:33.787
selected to be president, did you remember him 
from his undergraduate days? Yes. He came here

21:35.170 --> 21:44.641
from John Tarleton as what they call a frog

21:35.170 --> 21:44.641
junior or something like that. He had his basic 
military science up there. Did you know him as an

21:48.585 --> 21:50.948
undergraduate? Yeah. You were acquainted with 
him? Not personally, but... Because he and Tiger

21:52.449 --> 22:00.418
and Lupo were all in the same class, I think. Let's 
don't put Lupo's stories on the tape. But one, he

22:08.743 --> 22:12.332
was in my company. Lupo was? Yeah. What time he was 
there. But he visited all the freshmen in the first

22:16.936 --> 22:22.083
week with a couple of Stillson wrenches. And he 
said, you pay rent on the steam radiator is due the

22:22.965 --> 22:32.318
beginning of each month. And he had a few of them 
disconnected. until Tiger found out about it. He

22:42.463 --> 22:44.665
solved that right quick. He was renting, he was 
telling them that he was renting the radios to

22:44.685 --> 22:52.435
them. Now, I've heard a myth that Lupo got caught 
with beer in his room. Well, I wouldn't be a bit

22:57.521 --> 23:02.266
surprised if the attack officer happened to be 
there at the right time. Alright, when Mr. Rutter

23:03.528 --> 23:06.231
got here, Do you remember anything changing 
quickly when he takes over regarding student

23:07.308 --> 23:13.894
affairs? I don't know other than he had a lot more 
backing than maybe some of the other presidents

23:15.576 --> 23:23.463
gave the student affairs department. And he then 
brought in Dean Hannigan. How was he as dean of

23:27.506 --> 23:29.188
students? Describe him and his method. Well, if 
you cut this part of your tape out, Go ahead and

23:36.383 --> 23:37.885
record it. That's when I, when Dean Hannigan, been 
here a couple years, when I left during the fire.

23:47.618 --> 24:02.678
Korean veterans or Vietnam veterans were here and 
they would come to the dining hall to eat the

23:47.618 --> 24:02.678
evening meal barefooted, no shirt, a pair of 
dirty, sweaty trunks and maybe a jockey strap. And

24:04.126 --> 24:12.838
occasionally, we'd go to the dining hall at noon 
and at the end of the meal just to be seen and eyeball

24:04.126 --> 24:12.838
the situation. And on one afternoon, I turned back 
about five or six of them that were not presentable

24:14.000 --> 24:20.069
to eat. And they formed a committee of about three 
to see the dean the next morning that I wouldn't let

24:21.511 --> 24:31.585
them eat in the dining hall without going and 
taking a shower. And so the dean was agreeable with

24:32.662 --> 24:48.021
them, and he called Benny Zinn, who was my 
department's supervisor, and said, tell Breezer

24:32.662 --> 24:48.021
to let them eat any way they want to as long as they 
don't throw chairs and tables. Well, at that time,

24:48.001 --> 24:57.531
they were having an ad hoc committee, and Dorsey 
McCrory was head of it, studying the faculty mail

24:48.001 --> 24:57.531
service. It was in bad shape and had been for years 
because the extension service had taken one

24:58.432 --> 25:13.587
semester, the experiment station one semester, 
and the university one semester, and there was no

24:58.432 --> 25:13.587
continuity, no organization, and they were 
behind with all the mail. And this ad hoc committee

25:14.343 --> 25:29.533
come up with a recommendation for staff and 
equipment, budget and everything, and that the

25:14.343 --> 25:29.533
dormitory, that the male supervisor have a 
degree. And I applied for the job, and the only

25:29.513 --> 25:39.204
thing I knew was what to put on a three-cent stamp on 
a postcard, a letter. And it was three cents, I

25:40.546 --> 25:42.328
think then. And Herb Bovard was president, 
chairman of the Ag Communications Department.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.781
He's, I think, retired up in Experiment Station in 
East Texas. Hired me for the job over people who had

25:57.897 --> 26:02.153
had postal experience because of my knowledge of 
the campus. knew where all the departments were.

26:05.480 --> 26:09.683
And I got the job and stayed with them five years. 
And Mr. Hutter heard that I'd changed jobs, and he

26:10.805 --> 26:18.151
sent for me. I said, well, forget it. Walked down 
there, and I wondered what I've done now. Walked

26:23.456 --> 26:30.503
in, he closed the door, and sat down, and he said, I 
want to know why you left Student Affairs. And I

26:31.883 --> 26:33.606
told him. He beat his fist on the table and got up and 
walked around the table with me and sat down again.

26:40.556 --> 26:47.006
He said, I wish you'd have let me know and we'd have 
had a little battle on the campus and you and I had

26:40.556 --> 26:47.006
been on the same side. And

26:47.026 --> 26:56.541
I had been passed up on a job as supervisor of 
College View. They put some warrant officer in

26:57.972 --> 27:05.843
there that fiscal plants, Walter Parsons knew, in 
the service. And he didn't like that. I told him I'd

27:07.225 --> 27:09.168
been passed over that. He said, I wish you'd come 
talk to me. He said, are you satisfied with what

27:12.272 --> 27:14.395
you're doing? I said, yeah, because I can see if I do 
anything at all, it's going to be an improvement.

27:20.063 --> 27:23.267
And it took me about three months to get it 
straightened out. There was eight, there was

27:23.287 --> 27:25.330
enough packages to fill this room backlog the day I 
walked in there. And all I had to do was get some kind

27:31.233 --> 27:37.119
of supervision and system to divide them. And in a 
month's time, we were taking a sack full of

27:37.139 --> 27:44.606
packages of chemistry instead of them being mixed 
in the pack. I went to Post Office and borrowed some

27:45.307 --> 27:51.553
racks and mail sacks for about twenty of the big 
departments. made some bins and labeled them on

27:51.871 --> 27:54.576
the other side. And except for Monday morning, we 
cleaned out everything twice a day. And I got lots

28:01.729 --> 28:09.764
of compliments on that and spent a very enjoyable 
five years down there. The only time I was ever

28:09.784 --> 28:12.529
bothered early at night. that a truck wouldn't 
start at 5 30 in the morning to go to the mail

28:12.509 --> 28:19.117
sectional center and get first last mail. We'd 
start first last mail and deliver it at eight

28:19.338 --> 28:22.361
o'clock. And no drowned outs, no fire in the trash 
cans. But that was Mr. Rudder's feeling about

28:31.233 --> 28:32.514
that. Now, Dean Hennigan, to me, as an outsider, 
seemed not to understand Texas A&M. Well, I think

28:40.808 --> 28:49.700
that's one thing, and it either had to be like West 
Point was or not at all. Personally, I had nothing

28:49.880 --> 28:51.603
against him. Same here. We visited with him and had 
a meal or something together, student affairs

28:52.904 --> 29:05.061
quite often, but I just didn't want to approved 
something that I didn't think was right. I thought

29:09.485 --> 29:12.830
it was part of their training, and the rudder 
thought so too. One of my favorite Hannigan

29:12.850 --> 29:24.528
stories that I experienced personally, when the 
students were walking across the drill field so

29:12.850 --> 29:24.528
much, they were wearing a path across it. I was on 
the MSC Council, and there was a group of them, and

29:24.608 --> 29:31.077
somebody recommended that somehow it be cordoned 
off. So Hannigan said, put some bailing wire

29:31.097 --> 29:36.145
around all the trees two or three strands all the 
way around the drill field. Well of course the next

29:40.299 --> 29:43.965
morning all that bailing wire was cut many, many 
times. And we had a meeting and he was wondering

29:44.886 --> 29:50.555
where in the world any student would have found 
wire cutters. And I, with a little bit of country

29:51.557 --> 29:56.785
background, suggested that perhaps they're 
called pliers. And he said, where would they learn

29:58.228 --> 30:00.411
how to use them? That's the pair of pliers they cut 
to us. And where would they get them? And I said,

30:05.228 --> 30:09.878
well, if you look in any pickup, you'll find a pair. 
And if you ask any normal Texas kid, he will have

30:10.078 --> 30:15.209
used a lot of pliers, a lot. Or in his car, too, by the 
way. That's right. And he was very, very

30:18.977 --> 30:21.302
surprised. As you look back on those years, what 
were the key decisions that you now can think of

30:21.535 --> 30:35.497
that were made at A&M, whether you helped make them 
or not, during this 45 from U.K.? Well, I think

30:36.298 --> 30:43.770
military science being optional helped clean up 
the Corps. And I noticed an article in the

30:44.871 --> 30:47.796
yesterday's battalion about teaching them how to 
eat in the dining hall. Do you read that? And that

30:53.644 --> 31:07.202
and girls being admitted, because when I was in 
school the only people who could go, the ladies

30:53.644 --> 31:07.202
were daughters of employees.

31:08.363 --> 31:21.464
So I think that's the two main things that helped 
our enrollment and helped the personnel and the

31:08.363 --> 31:21.464
attitude in general. And it's

31:22.646 --> 31:28.936
just a different ballgame now. And we've got lots 
of student organizations.
