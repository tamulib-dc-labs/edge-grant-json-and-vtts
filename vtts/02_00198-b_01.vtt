WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:07.888
They stood on that particular issue and that they were not changing their minds on it.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.619
I mean, that it was preconceived.

00:10.679 --> 00:23.639
Also, there was an issue of the receptiveness of the community to international persons was a very burning issue at that time.

00:24.760 --> 00:35.016
And I remember having a sense that people sort of had built in or entrenched positions about what the dean of faculties ought to do

00:34.996 --> 00:36.077
on that issue.

00:36.137 --> 00:36.998
On international?

00:37.419 --> 00:39.541
Yes, on internationals.

00:39.641 --> 00:40.262
Clarify that.

00:40.362 --> 00:46.729
Graduate students and faculty sometimes do not find a very warm reception here.

00:48.111 --> 01:00.244
And there had been incidents that had been in the newspaper and I think people were carrying that concern into the interview process.

01:01.085 --> 01:04.209
So I'd been through that interview process once.

01:06.792 --> 01:13.801
Going through it the second time, I thought there was much less of the preconceived position.

01:13.821 --> 01:22.472
And also, obviously, I'd been at A&M long enough to know it a little better.

01:22.753 --> 01:30.062
And I think people had rightly been concerned that first time around that I just didn't know this community well enough.

01:30.430 --> 01:38.162
You met with faculty representatives, the provost, distinguished professors.

01:38.222 --> 01:40.185
What about the sitting deans?

01:40.305 --> 01:46.093
Were they part of the... Had a session with the sitting deans, certainly, and most of them were actually there.

01:46.174 --> 01:50.320
Maybe a couple had associate deans there to represent them.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.523
Remember any particular concerns they had?

01:54.055 --> 01:57.969
No, I wish I could.

01:58.029 --> 02:05.415
Did you get the impression from them at that point that they considered the dean of faculties as one of their peers?

02:08.838 --> 02:15.545
Yes, I did in the interview process, although, of course, I knew that in a sense that wasn't true.

02:15.565 --> 02:18.167
I mean, there were no surprises.

02:19.369 --> 02:24.654
The dean of faculties has the title dean, but it's dean without a college, you know.

02:25.995 --> 02:31.301
And that was already very clear to me, and it just wasn't an issue.

02:31.361 --> 02:38.608
They knew it, and I knew it, and we didn't have to explore that issue.

02:38.588 --> 02:48.468
They knew that I'd been associate dean for many years and that I had some grasp of how the dean of faculties worked with deans.

02:49.129 --> 02:51.514
How did you learn that you were the selectee?

02:53.979 --> 02:56.344
Well, I guess it was the chair of a committee

02:58.079 --> 03:03.450
No, it was the chair of the committee who had notified me that I was selected for the interview.

03:03.490 --> 03:10.083
It was the provost himself.

03:10.203 --> 03:11.747
I'm finally going to get this straight.

03:11.847 --> 03:12.949
Did he call you?

03:15.106 --> 03:22.694
I believe I had a call from his office and was asked to come back over to see him for a return trip.

03:22.734 --> 03:25.817
So I believe it was Norma Millsap who called me, actually.

03:26.578 --> 03:28.380
And we had a return visit.

03:28.980 --> 03:34.466
He was working out the terms of what he was willing to offer me.

03:34.506 --> 03:44.016
And it was one of the early general meetings in the Vision 2020

03:44.722 --> 03:47.326
project.

03:47.346 --> 04:07.759
I was had worked on vision 2020 project and I can remember that I went back down in the meeting room and I was listening to presentations and he came in a side door and started looking around the room and I slipped out and he had the offer letter ready at that time.

04:08.330 --> 04:23.250
where did you get either by written or by oral method, did you get any directions, guidelines as to what you would be doing as dean of faculties?

04:23.821 --> 04:35.566
We had, of course, discussed my understanding of the job, and I had worked with Bill Perry pretty darn closely since I was associate dean for faculty affairs in a big college.

04:35.586 --> 04:43.062
We had a lot of interaction, and so I had a pretty good grip on what the job was.

04:43.328 --> 04:57.642
But when I first started, I did meet with the provost every month for a good couple of hour session to go over what I was doing, what was up, what he wanted me to do.

04:57.682 --> 05:08.212
And for a while, I also had regular meetings with Bill Perry to get his immediate past perception and his suggestions.

05:08.513 --> 05:10.294
So there was a smooth transition.

05:10.415 --> 05:10.855
Yeah.

05:10.835 --> 05:13.522
Were there any fires to be put out?

05:14.746 --> 05:17.674
I think we had fires from day one.

05:17.714 --> 05:19.559
I can't remember specific.

05:19.579 --> 05:22.768
I guess the hottest fire when I came in

05:23.238 --> 05:35.258
was the resentment that still existed about two promotion and tenure cases from a year earlier, where the provost had decided against the college recommendations.

05:36.520 --> 05:46.576
And those had been made clear to me during the interview process, and there was still very strong resentment of those things.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.878
Why did you accept the position?

05:49.158 --> 05:51.500
I felt I could be a change agent.

05:53.282 --> 05:58.047
I knew that I took great satisfaction in doing faculty affairs.

05:59.108 --> 06:10.760
While I had been in a totally faculty role, I had enjoyed it very much, but I had sometimes felt deprivation of information.

06:11.881 --> 06:13.522
I like to know what's going on.

06:14.343 --> 06:18.287
I had known what was going on as associate dean, and suddenly I didn't anymore.

06:20.107 --> 06:23.131
I essentially couldn't resist.

06:24.974 --> 06:28.118
I was very clear I would never be an administrator again.

06:28.178 --> 06:36.750
And there was no other administrative job anywhere, I believe, that I would have taken except this one.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.993
Alright, did you have any personal goals?

06:40.508 --> 06:45.476
I certainly wanted to see fairness in our dealings with women.

06:45.496 --> 06:52.267
I wanted women to come to perceive this as a more welcoming place than women sometimes do.

06:52.788 --> 06:53.909
Sorry to have to tell you that.

06:55.211 --> 07:06.229
I was very invigorated by Vision 2020, and I was delighted at the thought of being a part of a process

07:06.209 --> 07:10.395
a part of a group of people trying to do something so ambitious.

07:12.579 --> 07:33.651
I don't think I said to myself when I took the job, my A number one goal is diversity at this institution, but it was not long thereafter that as I reflected on what I was doing, I knew that that was the most important thing for me.

07:34.694 --> 07:35.495
All right, trivia.

07:35.515 --> 07:38.318
Do you know, why is it dean of faculties?

07:38.378 --> 07:40.100
Why is it plural instead of singular?

07:41.421 --> 07:58.660
I don't know historically, but I do know the concept, which is that there is a faculty in this college, there is a faculty in that college, and this person, this official, is the dean of all those faculties.

07:59.281 --> 08:05.869
As an editorial note, when I inherited that title, I always wondered why.

08:07.451 --> 08:15.622
And some years later, I happened to be looking at an old Clemson College, it was then, Clemson College catalog.

08:17.084 --> 08:28.258
And I was looking through it, and I noticed that a man who had been a professor of history, Southern history being especially at Clemson, a man named Jack Kenny Williams,

08:29.133 --> 08:33.177
that he had just been appointed at Clemson as dean of faculties.

08:34.918 --> 08:49.552
And later I mentioned it to his wife, because Dr. Williams was dead by the time I learned this, I mentioned it to her and she said, yes, I think that's the way the title got to A&M, that that was the title he had had.

08:49.592 --> 08:58.600
Let's see, the staff you inherited, who was on the staff in the office when you became dean of faculties?

08:59.052 --> 09:06.420
Ann Pittman, of course, had worked for every dean of faculties that A&M had had.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.981
Describe her.

09:08.322 --> 09:11.745
I, by the way, think that you ought to be interviewing her.

09:12.086 --> 09:12.686
Oh, I plan to.

09:13.127 --> 09:15.069
A great sweep of time.

09:15.089 --> 09:15.169
Yes.

09:16.410 --> 09:22.697
And she is a person whose role has grown and matured.

09:24.449 --> 09:34.763
I don't know if in the first days she was more than a secretary, but certainly over the years had grown to be more than a secretary.

09:35.023 --> 09:43.775
And I think perhaps people's preconceptions of what a person like Ann Pittman can do have changed, and rightly so.

09:46.158 --> 09:51.705
She was, in fact, when you became the dean, she was kind of the chief of staff, wasn't she?

09:51.685 --> 09:52.546
Sure.

09:53.789 --> 09:56.052
And clearly, certainly is now.

09:56.092 --> 10:02.944
The main secretary to the dean of faculties had been Janice Crockett.

10:03.084 --> 10:05.268
She went with Bill Perry.

10:05.468 --> 10:07.451
She is up on the ninth floor now.

10:08.773 --> 10:14.503
And so we had to hire a secretary for me immediately.

10:15.563 --> 10:21.814
and I had some misadventure there, but I have a very good person now.

10:22.755 --> 10:31.630
Mildred Seaton was here as a receptionist and had worked in the office for quite some time.

10:32.191 --> 10:34.275
Mildred's now over at the Faculty Senate.

10:35.537 --> 10:39.343
There was a bookkeeper position that

10:39.323 --> 10:42.427
had been open for some time.

10:42.467 --> 10:46.513
I think illness of the previous person, but now I'm not sure.

10:46.553 --> 10:50.979
The office, the work was very badly backed up and stacked up.

10:51.801 --> 11:00.413
Ann made the decision and hired Betsy Moss, like maybe a couple of weeks or so before I came into the job.

11:01.214 --> 11:04.258
We have added one staff position.

11:04.919 --> 11:07.643
Now your official first day was...

11:09.108 --> 11:11.576
was August 1 of 1998.

11:11.817 --> 11:17.295
The provost had asked me to assume it on July 1,

11:17.933 --> 11:20.656
And I said, could I please delay it for a month?

11:20.736 --> 11:28.066
I was struggling to complete a book manuscript of which I'd written only about a fourth or so.

11:28.086 --> 11:32.992
And I wanted to get it as far along as I could before I came in here.

11:33.813 --> 11:42.844
In effect, that meant that I was about a third to a half time dean of faculties for the month of July without the salary, because I was in here a lot.

11:42.959 --> 11:51.274
And the location of the office was then, as it is now, on the sixth floor of Rudder.

11:51.554 --> 12:01.812
I would say that the physical surrounding was the aspect that gave me the most concern and caused me to hesitate before I took it.

12:01.792 --> 12:09.586
I don't like at all the way the office is split between sections, and now we're split in three sections.

12:09.907 --> 12:17.100
If you could be the supreme commander of Texas A&M, where would you have the major academic administrative offices?

12:18.734 --> 12:23.220
I'd put them back in what we used to call the system building, though that's not what it's called now.

12:23.421 --> 12:25.443
The Jack Williams building.

12:26.144 --> 12:27.186
I agree, I agree.

12:27.406 --> 12:28.688
I think that's where we ought to be.

12:30.290 --> 12:40.845
Describe, as you began to get fully involved in the routine of dean of faculties, what was a typical day, week, and season like?

12:40.905 --> 12:48.235
What were the different routines that you found consumed all your time?

12:48.468 --> 12:58.568
Yeah, of course we have a constant stream of hiring that's coming through, mostly in the spring semester, but dribbles throughout the year.

12:58.769 --> 13:00.632
Do you review all faculty?

13:00.953 --> 13:02.255
All faculty appointments.

13:02.396 --> 13:04.680
Whether they're tenure track or not.

13:04.801 --> 13:05.302
That's right.

13:05.863 --> 13:10.071
And what are the key items you look at as you review those materials?

13:10.608 --> 13:12.891
I look for degree.

13:13.131 --> 13:15.655
I mean, there are accreditation standards, after all.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.357
We have to see if we're meeting those.

13:17.918 --> 13:23.725
And sometimes people put through people who don't meet them.

13:23.745 --> 13:26.048
Once in a while, there's reason to make an exception.

13:26.088 --> 13:28.972
And if there is, I make sure it's written down.

13:28.992 --> 13:33.358
So if the Southern Association comes and looks, they'll know why we did it.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.193
So I look for degree.

13:36.713 --> 13:37.975
I look for record.

13:38.255 --> 13:40.438
I try to watch for fairness search.

13:44.283 --> 13:54.595
Sometimes, even though the dean of faculty's sign off is required, people have, in effect, hired somebody and done the paperwork in retrospect.

13:55.336 --> 14:03.987
I mean, yes, through informal deals, and that will probably always be true, but I've tried to

14:04.085 --> 14:16.979
remind people of the fact that we're supposed to do these things decently and in order and get the approvals first before we reach agreements with people.

14:17.320 --> 14:24.308
Which colleges have been, I'm not going to ask the negative, which colleges have been the best in doing it the way it should be done?

14:25.509 --> 14:27.291
The routine, the paperwork, and so forth?

14:27.575 --> 14:32.285
Oh, gee, I hate to brag, but I think liberal arts has been the best.

14:33.126 --> 14:44.911
Another college, which will remain nameless here, a year or so ago was hiring a person with tenure, which requires not only my approval, but the provost's personal approval.

14:46.013 --> 14:48.418
And when I called to say,

14:48.398 --> 14:52.625
Do you by any chance have the letters of recommendation that we'd like to look at?

14:52.645 --> 14:59.956
Because the provost had been saying, you know, we really ought to review these hires with tenure more thoroughly than maybe we have been.

14:59.996 --> 15:06.306
I found out not only had they no letters of recommendation, but the department had said, I hope there's no problem.

15:06.786 --> 15:08.449
He's already been here and bought a house.

15:10.133 --> 15:14.402
We were getting significantly out of order there, yes.

15:16.808 --> 15:29.475
The rhythm of work is very intense at the time of year when most academics are easing off between semesters because that's when the promotion and tenure files come.

15:29.455 --> 15:40.631
And I am always proud to say, and I say it over and over to various groups and individuals, that those files are read.

15:40.692 --> 15:48.303
They are not laid on a postage meter, and if they're heavy enough, they win, and if they're not, they don't.

15:49.164 --> 15:50.586
They are read.

15:51.190 --> 15:55.462
I read them all over the Christmas holidays.

15:56.666 --> 16:02.382
Usually I don't read files on December 25th, but every other day of the break.

16:03.138 --> 16:15.439
I know that the provost reads them all because when we get into those discussions with the deans, he will sometimes ask questions that I don't have down in my elaborate notes.

16:15.799 --> 16:20.026
And in his very brief notes, he has them.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.769
So we are reading those things.

16:23.072 --> 16:25.095
I keep data on them.

16:26.560 --> 16:33.026
I look for evidence that the teaching is being seriously considered.

16:33.846 --> 16:37.429
I know there are faculty who believe that nobody cares about teaching.

16:38.570 --> 16:42.714
I do not perceive it that way from the central procedure.

16:42.934 --> 16:46.497
I think teaching is looked at and carefully.

16:47.698 --> 16:49.900
And we spend a lot of time.

16:49.920 --> 16:55.285
I mean, these are decisions that affect people's whole professional lives.

16:55.737 --> 17:04.268
About, in general, what percentage of your time did you spend on at your desk simply reviewing paperwork?

17:05.470 --> 17:15.522
Oh, I spend most of my day here, probably more than I would if I didn't have email, because I'm a little bit of a slave to email.

17:15.783 --> 17:18.987
When it comes in, I look at it right away.

17:19.007 --> 17:23.753
I've always felt that administrators needed to be getting out

17:24.712 --> 17:26.715
and talking with the people out there.

17:26.795 --> 17:30.401
A college dean more so than the dean of faculties, I must say.

17:31.322 --> 17:36.370
But I did not do a good job of that when I was associate dean, and I don't do a good job of it now.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.653
I'm very much a desk person.

17:38.673 --> 17:42.619
Did you attempt to go to college faculty meetings?

17:44.675 --> 17:54.589
Oh, I go to every college faculty meetings in the fall when we give the teaching awards and make those presentations.

17:55.430 --> 18:07.367
I try to make sure that every year there's a notice sent out that if departments or colleges want me to come for an informal visit, I will do so.

18:07.407 --> 18:09.970
There are places where I have never been invited.

18:10.591 --> 18:13.315
There are places where I've been invited repeatedly.

18:13.295 --> 18:16.619
Who invite you most?

18:17.361 --> 18:30.158
Entomology has been the department that pops immediately to mind, is always wanting me to come every year, and the faculty always have questions, and we have a good conversation.

18:31.279 --> 18:34.003
There are places where I think

18:35.300 --> 18:42.734
People would wonder what I was doing there if I came over and why was I sticking my nose in and such as that.

18:43.195 --> 18:44.437
So I wait to be asked.

18:46.201 --> 18:52.212
Then during the week you meet with the deans, is it still called the APC?

18:52.732 --> 18:57.661
The APC, the Academic Program Council, meets once a month or sometimes twice a month.

18:58.422 --> 19:02.029
Those meetings are usually two and a half hours.

19:03.051 --> 19:09.322
There's provost staff meeting every Tuesday morning from 8.30 until 11.30.

19:09.442 --> 19:12.107
What are the normal topics there?

19:12.610 --> 19:20.398
We hear reports on what's doing at the coordinating board, what's doing at the legislature.

19:20.458 --> 19:33.813
The different associate provosts may have decisions coming up that they really want to kick around, and so we put things on the agenda and share them in group fashion.

19:34.493 --> 19:42.482
And the provost staff, who is most directly related to the coordinating board?

19:44.167 --> 19:46.109
Bill Perry and Jeanette Ferris.

19:46.209 --> 19:49.614
Jeanette does the direct contact.

19:49.634 --> 19:52.016
Did you go normally to coordinating board meetings?

19:53.518 --> 19:53.578
No.

19:53.598 --> 19:55.901
I went to a few when I was associate dean.

19:55.981 --> 19:59.165
I don't think I've been to a one since I've been dean of faculty.

19:59.626 --> 20:02.649
That used to be one of my, I always went to those.

20:02.829 --> 20:03.410
Yeah, no.

20:03.430 --> 20:09.938
All right, so other regular weekly meetings, weekly or monthly meetings,

20:09.918 --> 20:15.451
My own staff meets regularly once a week.

20:15.471 --> 20:21.987
I attend the Minority Conditions Subcommittee of the Faculty Senate, which meets monthly during the academic year.

20:22.248 --> 20:24.774
Minority Conditions?

20:24.794 --> 20:26.478
Subcommittee of the Faculty Senate.

20:26.498 --> 20:27.741
What are their primary concerns?

20:28.126 --> 20:30.288
Diversity on campus.

20:30.308 --> 20:32.210
What does the word conditions mean?

20:32.230 --> 20:35.373
Darn if I know how that name came about.

20:35.753 --> 20:40.097
When I was associate dean, there was a committee with that name, and who named it, I don't know.

20:40.357 --> 20:41.298
I just accept it.

20:42.279 --> 20:49.946
Status of women committee I attend, which some years is active and some years is not, depending on who's chairing it.

20:50.847 --> 20:56.732
Personnel and welfare committee of the Senate I meet with once a month, sometimes more often.

20:56.712 --> 21:07.109
Not usually the executive committee of the Senate, although if they invite me, then I go to those to attend the full Senate meetings once a month.

21:07.129 --> 21:15.683
Are there any, which faculty leaders would you give the highest marks to?

21:18.346 --> 21:26.386
We've had a succession of strong speakers of the Faculty Senate, especially last year and this year.

21:26.426 --> 21:29.273
Bob Strausser was the speaker last year.

21:29.293 --> 21:32.220
Rick Carlson is the speaker this year.

21:32.403 --> 21:37.609
And Rick Carlson's in Geosciences.

21:38.910 --> 21:40.191
Geology, I believe.

21:41.553 --> 21:50.122
And Rick worked very closely with last year's speaker, which I think is really how it should be, so that he was well informed.

21:50.883 --> 22:00.773
We meet together always once a month and sometimes more often to talk about issues that are before the Senate.

22:00.753 --> 22:06.119
I meet with the executive committee of the distinguished professors once a month.

22:09.303 --> 22:11.986
That's usually a lunch meeting at the faculty club.

22:13.528 --> 22:30.287
I have faculty members who drop by to see me, not usually without appointment, although I always tell when I go out to departments or whatever, it's an open door, you can drop by, but if you want to be sure of catching me, you might want an appointment.

22:30.385 --> 22:33.970
Now, in your normal schedule, you were on the campus from 7?

22:34.892 --> 22:40.340
I usually don't get here before 8 unless I have a scheduled breakfast meeting.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.301
8 till about what?

22:41.641 --> 22:42.503
Usually go home at 6.30.

22:42.523 --> 22:43.704
6.30.

22:44.626 --> 22:48.251
And of that time, you're physically in this office about?

22:48.291 --> 22:50.034
Three-fourths of the time.

22:50.054 --> 22:50.875
Three-fourths of the time.

22:52.237 --> 22:56.884
And looking at paperwork a lot of that time.

22:56.904 --> 22:59.127
Yeah, increasingly email.

22:59.242 --> 23:01.725
Okay, and I'm assuming that

23:02.077 --> 23:07.704
Not much of those matters are strict budget matters.

23:07.744 --> 23:08.905
They're personal matters.

23:09.005 --> 23:09.125
No.

23:09.145 --> 23:12.309
Personal matters are the main thing.

23:15.232 --> 23:25.204
Problem cases, of course, consume a disproportionate amount of your time, effort, and certainly emotional energy.

23:27.967 --> 23:30.210
We have a wonderful faculty here.

23:31.692 --> 23:35.296
The happiest thing I do is to see people's achievement.

23:36.077 --> 23:43.767
Those promotion cases, I mean, amazing people, wonderful things that they have done.

23:43.807 --> 23:45.810
That's the happiest.

23:46.190 --> 23:49.074
And most of our people are in that category.

23:49.794 --> 23:55.101
But when something goes wrong, for whatever reason,

23:55.486 --> 24:01.774
when somebody strays into a problem situation, when people stray into controversies.

24:03.736 --> 24:06.720
That's very few, but they take huge time.

24:09.002 --> 24:10.845
And they're emotionally draining.

24:10.865 --> 24:19.295
Have you, during these years as dean of faculties, have you had any cases that went to court that you were involved in?

24:19.395 --> 24:19.575
No.

24:22.439 --> 24:25.122
And certainly I want to keep it that way.

24:25.490 --> 24:30.280
To whom, to whom did you turn for advice?

24:34.329 --> 24:43.287
Jo Newton who is now interim dean of science and I have said this in public at groups and so that's why I'm willing to say it to you.

24:43.347 --> 24:45.051
Everybody has

24:45.655 --> 24:48.879
people to whom they go for advice and counsel.

24:49.139 --> 25:00.332
And Joe, I find to be thoughtful and wise and very humane in his motivation.

25:02.314 --> 25:08.481
Larry Oliver, the Associate Dean of Liberal Arts, I have sometimes gone to for advice.

25:11.465 --> 25:14.228
Pierce Cantrell and Mark Weichold and I

25:14.208 --> 25:27.480
work together a lot and we we share around the phone calls and Do you on occasion call somebody and say let's just go to lunch or let's go have some coffee and relax and unload?

25:28.421 --> 25:43.455
Not very often unless this time has gone by and I've kind of gotten caught up more and more in the Oh the image that comes to mind is of coils of rope kind of tying you in you know and

25:43.891 --> 25:50.578
of the demands of the job, but of course once in a while, but not very often.

25:50.618 --> 25:53.381
Julia Blackwelder, department head in history.

25:53.442 --> 26:05.074
Julia and I go back quite a few years and will about once a semester have a lunch that's kind of just for fun and chatting.

26:08.318 --> 26:12.042
What should be the primary task of the dean of faculties?

26:13.928 --> 26:21.361
Ensuring fairness, ensuring that policies are adhered to and are applied equally.

26:24.767 --> 26:32.281
To a slightly lesser degree, attempting to construct, to help construct policies that are fair.

26:32.301 --> 26:38.552
I think the dean of faculties needs to be a voice for fairness.

26:40.388 --> 26:55.942
the dean of faculties needs to attempt to represent the faculty voice to the administration to ensure that when decisions are made that should involve the faculty, that they do involve the faculty.

26:57.784 --> 27:08.353
I'm nodding because when people ask me in my years what it was, I told them that I thought the task was to speak for the faculty to the administration and on occasion

27:08.502 --> 27:13.788
for the administration to the faculty directly without going through all the others.

27:15.070 --> 27:20.777
And certainly Dr. Williams certainly liked that idea.

27:21.458 --> 27:30.008
Are there any other areas of responsibility that ought to be under the dean of faculties that are not?

27:35.154 --> 27:38.138
Now that's a good question.

27:40.278 --> 27:42.442
I don't know that that's true.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.629
I can't think of any right now.

27:45.669 --> 28:02.202
We have had some discussions about international services, whether it should be under the dean of faculties, because most of the international processing, and by that I mean the visa kinds of consideration, most of that pertains to faculty.

28:02.182 --> 28:13.108
But it's also a very specialized expertise and wherever it's placed, there are going to be advantages and disadvantages.

28:13.469 --> 28:16.917
On the whole, I think we're well served with leaving it where it is.

28:17.015 --> 28:21.120
What about the experiment stations and extension services should?

28:21.140 --> 28:21.380
No.

28:22.081 --> 28:22.762
Should not be?

28:23.183 --> 28:24.004
I don't think so.

28:24.064 --> 28:26.347
Those are separate agencies.

28:26.387 --> 28:42.887
I've had some concerns over are we always maintaining clarity of lines between who's university faculty and who is not because the tenure system applies to university faculty but it does not to the agencies.

28:43.981 --> 28:50.327
Let's see, were you expected to attend regents meetings?

28:50.968 --> 28:51.168
No.

28:51.728 --> 29:05.982
I have a couple of times attended regents meetings because of things that were on the agenda that were of interest and I wanted to be there to hear the discussion, but I'm not expected to attend them, no.

29:06.262 --> 29:09.085
Alumni form student event?

29:09.506 --> 29:10.967
No, really not.

29:11.993 --> 29:13.236
Let's see.

29:13.256 --> 29:14.379
Mention lawsuits.

29:15.642 --> 29:17.326
You review all promotion.

29:17.828 --> 29:18.048
Right.

29:18.790 --> 29:19.472
And tenure.

29:19.953 --> 29:20.194
Right.

29:20.615 --> 29:21.397
Terminations.

29:21.818 --> 29:22.700
Oh, heavens yes.

29:23.763 --> 29:27.893
And annual salary.

29:29.695 --> 29:30.736
It's interesting.

29:30.896 --> 29:39.106
I don't think the dean of faculties is as involved in annual salary matters as perhaps was true when you were in this position.

29:39.146 --> 29:40.908
Partly it's a function of the numbers.

29:41.669 --> 29:43.071
I mean, it's a huge faculty.

29:43.912 --> 29:57.508
I can remember in the first years when I was associate dean, at budget time, we came over and presented our budget to the provost and at least

29:58.788 --> 30:01.713
Well, I guess it was Danny Parker at that time who's still there.

30:02.414 --> 30:05.820
And we went over name by name those salary recommendations.

30:06.341 --> 30:09.146
That has not been done in years.

30:10.188 --> 30:24.492
And now I don't even know what the salaries are being recommended unless they are above the guidelines, unless they are exceptional ones that require central approval, and then I do.

30:24.860 --> 30:26.923
But I find out after the fact.

30:27.364 --> 30:38.682
And from the standpoint of working proactively on salary equity questions, I find that a little bothersome.

30:39.883 --> 30:41.586
I wish that we looked at it first.

30:42.460 --> 30:43.041
We don't.

30:43.061 --> 30:47.612
Let's see, you do look at review every new faculty appointment.

30:48.033 --> 30:48.995
Yes.

30:50.539 --> 31:01.144
And are some of those difficult to identify if they are part-time faculty and part-time something else?

31:03.368 --> 31:05.872
Paperwork should make it pretty transparent.

31:06.132 --> 31:10.479
If I don't know what it is, then something hasn't been filled out right.

31:11.381 --> 31:13.605
Because I shouldn't have any trouble telling that.

31:14.526 --> 31:14.666
Yeah.

31:15.287 --> 31:19.574
And people have to be at least a third with the university to be eligible for tenure.

31:19.855 --> 31:21.157
Okay.

31:21.177 --> 31:23.200
And in terms of...
