WEBVTT

00:03.575 --> 00:05.599
now realize were really important?

00:07.463 --> 00:08.806
Oh, I think all of them was.

00:08.906 --> 00:14.177
I think engineering courses teach you to think.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.804
And I enjoyed them.

00:17.864 --> 00:19.067
Some of them was pretty rough.

00:19.788 --> 00:23.997
Civil engineering, which I enjoyed very much.

00:24.415 --> 00:28.040
Now, did you think you were going to be in the petroleum business when you got through?

00:28.360 --> 00:29.362
Yes, sir.

00:29.382 --> 00:30.083
I sure did.

00:30.824 --> 00:36.712
And my brother that helped me through college, he had hoped I'd get in the petroleum business.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.334
He was in the automobile business.

00:38.995 --> 00:48.447
And he told me that when I got through that he wanted me to go to work for an oil company and work a few years, and then he wanted to put me in the oil business.

00:48.467 --> 00:52.633
Well, when I got back from overseas, I went to every major oil company.

00:53.255 --> 00:57.929
And all of them had more engineers in service than they thought they was going to have to take back.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.494
There wasn't any chance.

00:59.815 --> 01:02.623
Finally, I got an offer from Pan American.

01:03.481 --> 01:06.264
in Raymondville, Texas.

01:06.284 --> 01:10.629
And my brother had been in the Valley for about nine years previous to that.

01:10.829 --> 01:12.871
And I asked him, I said, what about Raymondville?

01:13.352 --> 01:24.064
He said, Raymondville is 85% Latin American and 5% Afro-American and the rest of them white.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.046
And I said, well, I don't believe I wanted to go.

01:26.515 --> 01:28.918
So I didn't take a job with the Cold Dominion business.

01:29.639 --> 01:35.706
And I found a place in Madisonville, Texas, an automobile supply house that was for sale.

01:36.247 --> 01:39.271
And I bought it with the help from my brother.

01:40.272 --> 01:43.035
And I stayed there three years.

01:44.277 --> 01:47.121
And after three years, I was barely just making a living.

01:47.922 --> 01:51.145
And he was the dealer in Houston for Knapp Chevrolet.

01:51.186 --> 01:55.611
Knapp didn't have anybody by the name of Knapp in Houston.

01:56.030 --> 01:59.357
My brother had put in the dealership Farnap in 1940.

02:00.316 --> 02:03.059
And he said, you can come work for me.

02:03.299 --> 02:08.365
And I went to work for him for $300 a month, which at that time was a big salary.

02:09.326 --> 02:13.811
And I went there in November of 48.

02:14.832 --> 02:26.104
April the 1st of 49, my older brother, my brother just older than I and myself bought out Pollard Chevrolet in Houston.

02:26.995 --> 02:30.659
And that's where I got in really in the automobile business.

02:30.679 --> 02:33.142
So a little more than 50 years now.

02:33.162 --> 02:33.823
Yes, sir.

02:33.843 --> 02:34.564
Oh, that's good.

02:35.986 --> 02:36.366
Let's see.

02:36.386 --> 02:50.923
Back before the war, can you share with this machine any pranks, jokes, good bull that you remember any of the students doing when you were at A&M?

02:50.983 --> 02:52.565
Yes, sir.

02:52.645 --> 02:56.850
My battery, battery D, we followed a fake...

02:57.792 --> 02:58.213
murder.

03:00.656 --> 03:26.449
We had two boys, an upperclassman that kind of, they made like they was mad at one another, all the drills and all, and so Charlie Kirkpatrick, who I cleaned up his room, and a fellow from Dallas, they got in a scrabble and then Charlie supposed to have killed him

03:26.952 --> 03:32.159
And they called us up and he was laying in the shower with ketchup all over him.

03:32.179 --> 03:32.780
It looked like it.

03:33.381 --> 03:41.392
And they sent us all and they made us all go up to our room and stay in the room, wouldn't let us out.

03:41.492 --> 03:45.077
And then we had a fish sergeant by the name of Frank Nice.

03:45.678 --> 03:50.705
And Frank was supposed to guard everybody.

03:51.566 --> 03:52.167
And...

03:54.391 --> 04:05.222
Oh, after about three or four hours, well, Kirk Patrick walked in Nice's room, and when he did, Nice took out through the window.

04:05.903 --> 04:11.389
Went through screen, window and all, went up to the steps of the YMCA.

04:11.789 --> 04:12.750
So he fell for it?

04:13.331 --> 04:14.532
All of us fell for it.

04:14.552 --> 04:16.014
We all thought it was real.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.116
We all thought it was real.

04:18.777 --> 04:20.719
And they pulled out again.

04:20.739 --> 04:23.942
Oh, I guess it was my...

04:24.563 --> 04:28.187
Junior or senior year, I believe it was my junior year, we pulled it again.

04:29.829 --> 04:36.177
Did anybody ever try to play any pranks on a teacher in class?

04:36.697 --> 04:37.859
Not that I know of.

04:38.099 --> 04:45.248
As far as you understood it, what were the expected behavior rules when you were in class?

04:48.832 --> 04:50.654
You behaved.

04:50.794 --> 04:53.237
There wasn't any talking or anything.

04:55.259 --> 04:58.645
We had to behave in class.

04:58.686 --> 05:00.749
There wasn't any cut up in class.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.773
And you went regularly.

05:02.914 --> 05:05.438
Did anybody ever go to sleep in class?

05:06.300 --> 05:06.701
Oh, yeah.

05:07.182 --> 05:07.903
Yeah.

05:08.164 --> 05:09.526
What would the teachers do then?

05:11.370 --> 05:16.339
Well, the only place I ever saw anybody sleeping in class was in lectures.

05:17.230 --> 05:20.275
Did anybody ever give another student a hot foot?

05:21.336 --> 05:21.737
Oh, yeah.

05:22.298 --> 05:23.219
Yeah, that's common.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.884
And was Reveille around at that time?

05:27.165 --> 05:29.849
Yes, Reveille was the first Reveille at that time.

05:30.510 --> 05:35.637
And she stayed around Puryear Hall a lot.

05:35.657 --> 05:38.442
And she come in my room a lot.

05:38.462 --> 05:44.511
And I kind of keep my door closed because if she got on the bed, you didn't get on the bed.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.073
You had to leave her on the bed.

05:46.677 --> 05:49.920
If Reveille got on your bed, where did you sleep then?

05:51.462 --> 05:54.525
I slept on the floor.

05:55.706 --> 05:57.148
Describe that first Reveille.

05:57.989 --> 05:59.811
Well, she's just a little old black dog.

05:59.871 --> 06:01.192
I call her a common dog.

06:03.334 --> 06:06.838
She hated the black people.

06:07.098 --> 06:11.723
When the Afro-Americans come through the campus, man, she was raised then.

06:12.412 --> 06:21.041
And then when we was out drilling, if we had somebody absent and that spot was vacant, she'd get in a part in March with you.

06:22.603 --> 06:27.448
And did that Reveille, did she live through your years at A&M?

06:27.548 --> 06:28.870
Yes, sir.

06:29.651 --> 06:32.013
And who took care of Reveille in those days?

06:33.215 --> 06:34.116
Oh.

06:34.136 --> 06:34.656
Was there a?

06:34.836 --> 06:37.760
There wasn't, as far as I know, anybody.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.022
And she just roamed the campus.

06:40.846 --> 06:44.151
She had free access to the campus.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.973
And was allowed in the dining hall?

06:47.095 --> 06:48.577
No, sir, I don't know.

06:48.597 --> 06:50.319
I was in Sebesa Hall.

06:51.501 --> 06:52.802
Did she go to football games?

06:52.963 --> 06:54.585
Yes, sir.

06:54.625 --> 06:55.706
Home games.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.291
Let's see.

07:00.173 --> 07:04.879
The YMCA, what role did it play in your life as an Aggie?

07:06.935 --> 07:07.337
Well.

07:07.518 --> 07:08.745
What all happened at the Y?

07:09.067 --> 07:12.928
Of course the bowling alley was in the Y and the pool all was in the Y.

07:13.415 --> 07:16.318
Was it okay for a boy from Kirbyville to shoot poo?

07:17.259 --> 07:18.000
Yes, sir.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.303
I don't know if I shot any of my freshman year, but after that it was.

07:22.605 --> 07:26.269
And were there some religious activities at the Y?

07:27.069 --> 07:27.850
Yes, sir, a few.

07:29.852 --> 07:33.756
Did you participate in any Sunday church going?

07:33.776 --> 07:37.500
No, sir.

07:39.883 --> 07:40.063
No, sir.

07:42.389 --> 07:46.434
Let's see, no, the MS, oh, if you got sick, where did you go?

07:47.175 --> 07:48.017
I had a hospital.

07:48.497 --> 07:49.499
And who was the doctor?

07:49.939 --> 07:50.580
Dr. Marsh?

07:50.840 --> 07:53.864
Dr. Marsh, I'll never forget him.

07:53.884 --> 08:03.557
My freshman year, after the basketball season, just to start the baseball season, I played softball.

08:03.698 --> 08:05.460
I was a catcher in softball.

08:06.014 --> 08:16.707
And we was playing out on the drill field, and a batter hit a little old pop foul, and I run after it, and the pitcher run after it, and his knee hit my jaw and broke my jaw.

08:17.529 --> 08:24.958
And I went back to the dorm at night, and the CQ come around about 2 o'clock in the morning.

08:25.639 --> 08:31.506
Well, I first went to the hospital, and the hospital, Dr. Morris x-rayed my jaw and said, there's nothing wrong with it.

08:31.546 --> 08:32.207
Go on back.

08:33.132 --> 08:34.494
I went on back to the dorm.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.239
About 2 o'clock that morning, the CQ come around, and I was still awake.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.342
He says, Fisherist, what you doing awake?

08:40.442 --> 08:41.344
I said, I'm hurting.

08:42.045 --> 08:43.126
He says, what's the matter?

08:43.146 --> 08:43.867
And I told him.

08:44.288 --> 08:46.511
He said, we're going back to the hospital right now.

08:47.272 --> 08:48.674
He carried me to the hospital.

08:49.615 --> 08:51.678
Dr. Morris x-rayed my jaw again.

08:51.738 --> 08:53.341
He said, nothing wrong with it.

08:53.701 --> 08:57.507
The technician that was having him, he says, doctor, that boy's jaw is broke.

08:58.428 --> 08:59.710
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.572
He says, take another picture.

09:01.592 --> 09:02.734
He took another picture.

09:03.102 --> 09:07.287
and my jaw bone was broke and a V over a tooth.

09:07.307 --> 09:29.110
And so I went on back to the dorm and the next morning my daddy had a cousin who was a medical doctor in Bryan, Dr. Richardson, and he called him and I went in to see him and he sent me to Dr. Lamar Smith, a dentist, and the dentist

09:29.782 --> 09:33.088
Looked at me and he said, come back, I believe, I believe.

09:33.148 --> 09:35.532
I went back that Saturday, Sunday afternoon.

09:36.153 --> 09:40.741
Anyway, he had me in the dental chair and he said, close your mouth.

09:40.761 --> 09:43.946
I worked on my teeth a while and after a while he said, close your mouth.

09:44.688 --> 09:49.275
I closed my mouth and then I said, Bronco, I can't open it.

09:49.295 --> 09:52.140
He said, it's going to be six weeks before you open that mouth again.

09:52.180 --> 09:54.304
He had wired my jaws together.

09:54.571 --> 10:06.331
And thank goodness I had a tooth out, a jaw tooth out, and I was able to take malted milk and soup through that place where the tooth was out.

10:06.351 --> 10:07.593
And I got along pretty good.

10:08.014 --> 10:13.844
Now, while your jaw was wired together, did you march?

10:14.145 --> 10:14.685
Yes, sir.

10:15.206 --> 10:16.208
I sure did.

10:16.441 --> 10:21.993
And when the final drill came, see, that was almost the end of the season.

10:22.854 --> 10:29.488
And when the final drill come, I went to the doctor and asked him for a permit not to have to do final drill.

10:30.050 --> 10:36.964
He says, Richon, I'll give you the best bed in the hotel or a glass of milk on the way out, but I won't give him the exemption.

10:37.636 --> 10:43.241
So I went back to my company commander, and he says, you just skip drill.

10:43.261 --> 10:44.162
You don't have to drill.

10:44.842 --> 10:47.465
So I didn't make the final drill that year.

10:48.125 --> 10:48.326
All right.

10:48.346 --> 10:52.049
That first year, you went home for the first time at Thanksgiving.

10:52.069 --> 10:52.990
Thanksgiving.

10:53.010 --> 10:54.271
Then again at Christmas.

10:54.291 --> 10:54.931
Then at Christmas.

10:55.332 --> 10:55.932
Then when?

10:56.493 --> 10:57.514
Did you go home in spring?

10:58.194 --> 10:58.595
Yes, sir.

10:58.935 --> 10:59.596
And that was all.

10:59.716 --> 11:00.276
That was all.

11:00.917 --> 11:01.818
And hitchhiking.

11:02.158 --> 11:02.959
Hitchhiking.

11:02.979 --> 11:04.160
And I went to summer school.

11:05.241 --> 11:05.761
At A&M?

11:05.801 --> 11:06.782
Yes, sir.

11:06.762 --> 11:09.246
So I was away from home all that year.

11:09.686 --> 11:14.974
Now, in summer school in those days, were women allowed?

11:15.355 --> 11:16.977
Were there girls in summer school?

11:18.719 --> 11:23.927
There was factory members' daughters and teachers that...

11:24.515 --> 11:28.764
that already finished college and was teaching, they'd come back and take a course, yes.

11:28.784 --> 11:31.509
But you didn't have to wear uniforms in the summer or did you?

11:31.610 --> 11:32.050
No, sir.

11:32.071 --> 11:32.732
Didn't have to wear.

11:33.033 --> 11:33.854
Lived in the dorm.

11:34.135 --> 11:34.455
Yes, sir.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.626
Do you have any idea what that freshman year cost?

11:39.646 --> 11:43.013
Do you remember what the tuition or the fees were?

11:43.280 --> 11:45.685
Oh, I forgot how much the tuition was.

11:45.806 --> 11:50.075
My room and board was about $32 a month.

11:50.095 --> 11:55.026
And you said you had a job beginning almost the first day?

11:55.046 --> 11:57.992
No, six weeks or so.

11:58.413 --> 12:02.402
When did you do those chores?

12:02.905 --> 12:13.014
Setting the pins, there was some after-time classes was out to about CQ that night, which was, oh, 7 o'clock or something.

12:13.034 --> 12:13.315
Okay.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.437
And then that second job?

12:18.019 --> 12:21.022
Taking up cleaning and pression, I just went around the dorm team.

12:21.102 --> 12:27.307
In my company, I only took up cleaning and pression in Lattery D. Do you remember what Hollicks paid you for that?

12:27.968 --> 12:28.348
No, sir.

12:29.389 --> 12:31.151
I don't remember.

12:31.171 --> 12:32.372
Describe Mr. Hollick.

12:33.922 --> 12:40.193
Well, he was, I don't know, Mr. Honick, I didn't see him too much.

12:40.313 --> 12:41.856
I saw him as his manager.

12:41.876 --> 12:42.357
Oh, okay.

12:42.637 --> 12:45.803
And they were there at the corner at Northgate?

12:46.444 --> 12:48.327
What else was there at Northgate then?

12:50.091 --> 12:54.478
Well, there was a drugstore on the corner, and then A.M.

12:54.498 --> 12:55.440
Waldrop was there.

12:58.053 --> 12:59.394
Was old Army Lou there?

13:01.677 --> 13:04.620
No, I don't remember him having a store there at that time.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.463
Then there was the Lily ice cream store, I will remember it.

13:08.024 --> 13:09.706
Did you go to the... Yes, sir.

13:09.726 --> 13:10.807
What was your favorite dish?

13:11.528 --> 13:12.449
Vanilla ice cream.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.514
Was the campus theater there yet?

13:17.674 --> 13:27.705
The old campus theater was there, which was tore down, well it was tore down I guess while I was there.

13:29.744 --> 13:32.348
It was, that was a peanut throwing theater.

13:32.749 --> 13:38.438
In other words, we all bought peanuts and then threw, that's where we threw peanuts at the upperclassmen.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.960
When, oh, when the lights went off.

13:40.160 --> 13:40.601
Yeah.

13:40.621 --> 13:43.766
Did y'all make noise while the movie was going on sometimes?

13:43.786 --> 13:45.429
While sometimes, not very often.

13:45.989 --> 13:50.977
Now, then Guyon Hall, did it have movies regularly?

13:51.318 --> 13:54.763
Last part of my, it wasn't there when I first went there.

13:54.903 --> 13:55.825
Oh, Guyon was not?

13:56.225 --> 13:56.285
No.

13:56.305 --> 13:57.287
When was it built?

13:57.571 --> 14:01.358
Oh, I'd say it was built in, I can't say the date.

14:01.438 --> 14:04.363
I built in the late 30s, early 40s.

14:04.643 --> 14:05.104
Oh, okay.

14:08.029 --> 14:08.530
Let's see.

14:10.514 --> 14:14.601
Guyon, your freshman year,

14:15.695 --> 14:19.059
Did you ever think about dropping out of school, quitting?

14:19.079 --> 14:19.880
No, sir.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.300
Never did.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.882
No, sir.

14:22.843 --> 14:24.825
And you never did think about transferring.

14:25.146 --> 14:25.606
No, sir.

14:25.626 --> 14:28.509
You were you were always proud to be an Aggie.

14:30.872 --> 14:39.021
What was it as a fish that made you started making you proud to be at A&M?

14:39.041 --> 14:45.128
Well, one of the things I didn't have any money and I didn't know nobody knew in the Corps

14:45.496 --> 14:46.898
who had money and who didn't.

14:47.959 --> 14:50.442
We was all just alike.

14:50.462 --> 14:54.246
Now when we went on a court trip, of course, some of them had money and some of us didn't.

14:54.807 --> 15:01.995
But as far as on the campus, nobody knew who had, whether they had money or not.

15:02.015 --> 15:06.561
Did it matter if you were a Baptist or a Catholic or?

15:07.342 --> 15:08.363
No, sir.

15:08.383 --> 15:14.550
What about where you came from, whether you were from the small town or the country or the big city?

15:14.890 --> 15:15.351
Well,

15:16.765 --> 15:21.211
In my company, the boys and daddies had a kind of little clique.

15:23.134 --> 15:24.556
They kind of favored one another.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.020
Did you all ever play any tricks on them?

15:27.340 --> 15:28.341
No, sir.

15:28.362 --> 15:28.922
No, sir.

15:28.942 --> 15:30.465
There's too many of them.

15:30.485 --> 15:30.605
Oh.

15:32.347 --> 15:36.373
What about the religious activities around the campus?

15:37.174 --> 15:44.865
Were there some... Well, of course, they built a little church

15:46.263 --> 15:48.747
Well, it was built after I finished.

15:48.767 --> 15:53.034
See, it was almost where the old theater was, not right next to it.

15:53.054 --> 15:54.496
Oh, the chapel, the little chapel.

15:54.636 --> 15:54.937
Yes, sir.

15:55.898 --> 15:58.021
Did the Aggies go to church much on Sunday?

15:58.041 --> 15:58.422
Yes, sir.

15:59.023 --> 15:59.824
I was a Baptist.

15:59.884 --> 16:02.308
I went to the Baptist church, which is at Northgate.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.233
Did you go on Sunday night some?

16:07.416 --> 16:07.676
No.

16:07.757 --> 16:11.122
I was going to ask if they had Sunday night supper or anything like that.

16:11.723 --> 16:14.447
Did you have any dates when you were a freshman?

16:14.630 --> 16:15.651
I didn't, no sir.

16:16.092 --> 16:17.374
Did you go to any of the dances?

16:17.794 --> 16:19.616
Very few, very few.

16:19.697 --> 16:20.558
I'm not a dancer.

16:21.739 --> 16:25.785
Now the faculty lived, many of the faculty lived on campus.

16:26.045 --> 16:27.967
Around the campus, yes sir.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.091
Did they ever invite you students to their home?

16:31.572 --> 16:37.099
Well, I was invited to a math teacher, I forget his name.

16:37.520 --> 16:41.565
He was an uncle of one of the boys from Jasper, Texas.

16:41.545 --> 16:43.268
That's the only one I ever visited.

16:45.272 --> 16:51.204
Your first year, do you remember going to your first midnight Yale practice?

16:52.346 --> 16:53.007
Or do you remember?

16:53.247 --> 16:54.810
Yes, I remember.

16:54.851 --> 16:55.412
Describe.

16:56.053 --> 16:59.059
Well, we all had to go and we all had to hump.

16:59.239 --> 17:02.946
It was held on the YMCA steps at that time.

17:02.926 --> 17:25.423

17:30.061 --> 17:32.083
I don't know, about an hour before game time.

17:32.263 --> 17:33.204
Did you march in?

17:33.404 --> 17:34.265
Was there a review?

17:34.846 --> 17:37.148
Sometimes we did, sometimes we didn't.

17:37.168 --> 17:37.848
And you stood up?

17:38.149 --> 17:38.509
Yes, sir.

17:38.529 --> 17:39.790
We stood up the whole game.

17:40.491 --> 17:43.213
Were there many dates in the... Yes, sir.

17:43.233 --> 17:46.777
Well, I didn't have any dates, but a lot of the students had dates.

17:46.797 --> 17:48.438
And you went on a court trip.

17:48.458 --> 17:48.819
Yes, sir.

17:49.620 --> 17:53.563
Describe going on an Aggie court trip in the 30s.

17:53.583 --> 17:57.007
Well, first one I went on was on Fort Worth.

17:59.149 --> 17:59.629
And...

18:00.183 --> 18:03.528
I lost my raincoat, trench coat.

18:03.548 --> 18:05.511
But I got it back.

18:05.531 --> 18:06.252
How did that happen?

18:06.332 --> 18:06.732
I don't know.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.215
They sent it back to somebody.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.558
I had our names and all of them.

18:10.578 --> 18:11.900
Somebody sent it back to me.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.762
My, my.

18:13.783 --> 18:14.744
How did you get up there?

18:15.685 --> 18:16.346
I hit site.

18:17.768 --> 18:20.712
And did you come back after the game or did you spend the night?

18:21.193 --> 18:22.415
No, I spent one night.

18:22.735 --> 18:22.996
Where?

18:23.837 --> 18:28.063
In the... Oh...

18:29.275 --> 18:30.496
Old, old hotel.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.119
There was a boy there from Kirbyville that had a room.

18:33.159 --> 18:34.281
He wasn't in that Aggie.

18:34.661 --> 18:34.861
Oh.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.323
And I spent the night with him.

18:36.343 --> 18:36.724
Okay.

18:39.747 --> 18:43.211
And then the other court trip would have been to Houston or to Austin?

18:44.513 --> 18:45.654
We went to Waco.

18:45.694 --> 18:46.595
We went to Waco.

18:46.715 --> 18:47.476
Okay.

18:47.496 --> 18:48.818
Not only about a freshman year.

18:48.898 --> 18:49.358
I don't know.

18:49.418 --> 18:51.681
You went back too many years now.

18:51.741 --> 18:53.243
I can't even remember all that.

18:53.563 --> 18:56.987
Of all of the court trips you remember, which one was your favorite?

18:58.351 --> 19:00.834
Was there any one that you really enjoyed?

19:00.854 --> 19:05.460
I enjoyed them all.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.301
No special one.

19:07.143 --> 19:10.767
And you made court trips to Austin?

19:11.448 --> 19:12.249
Yes, sir.

19:12.269 --> 19:14.973
How were Aggies treated in those cities?

19:15.213 --> 19:19.158
I was always treated nice.

19:19.198 --> 19:20.460
I was never treated bad.

19:21.402 --> 19:25.226
And I know of any place that they were treated bad.

19:26.728 --> 19:30.892
That first year, did you work on bonfire?

19:32.393 --> 19:34.255
I guarded the bonfire.

19:34.275 --> 19:36.998
It was right out my dorm.

19:37.018 --> 19:38.320
On the drill field.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.881
On the drill field.

19:39.901 --> 19:42.144
I had to guard it at night, shifts at night.

19:42.324 --> 19:46.068
About how long did they gather stuff for the bonfire?

19:48.991 --> 19:51.173
Oh, 30 days.

19:51.693 --> 19:53.275
And what was in the bonfire?

19:53.295 --> 19:54.076
What did they burn?

19:55.198 --> 20:02.367
Just old scrap lumber that they could find anywhere, trash, and then we got an outhouse and put on top of it.

20:02.788 --> 20:04.870
Where did the outhouse come from?

20:05.251 --> 20:08.475
It come from somebody's home.

20:08.495 --> 20:15.304
Now, I've heard that the college would pay that family for the new outhouse.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.666
Did you ever hear that?

20:16.766 --> 20:17.627
No, sir.

20:17.647 --> 20:18.909
I've wondered if that is true.

20:19.069 --> 20:19.570
I don't know.

20:19.690 --> 20:21.092
I never heard that.

20:21.072 --> 20:33.190
And I understand that sometimes they would get those little carts over at the railroad station and put the trash on that to roll it over.

20:34.372 --> 20:37.877
And all right, then other Silver Taps.

20:38.297 --> 20:40.180
Do you remember going to Silver Taps?

20:40.200 --> 20:41.382
Yes, sir.

20:41.402 --> 20:42.183
Describe that.

20:44.386 --> 20:45.528
It was something new to me.

20:47.591 --> 20:48.953
It kind of got to me.

20:49.743 --> 20:51.125
Did you all take it seriously?

20:51.145 --> 20:51.665
Yes, sir.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.047
Very seriously.

20:53.067 --> 20:53.928
Very seriously.

20:54.689 --> 20:55.590
And everybody went?

20:56.091 --> 20:56.832
Everybody went.

20:56.932 --> 20:59.014
Yes, sir.

20:59.174 --> 20:59.415
All right.

20:59.455 --> 21:02.258
Let's move on then to final review.

21:02.278 --> 21:06.203
Do you remember what that was like your first year, two or three years?

21:06.423 --> 21:06.984
I missed it.

21:07.585 --> 21:07.705
Oh.

21:08.766 --> 21:09.987
I told you.

21:10.008 --> 21:11.389
That's when my jaw was broken.

21:11.409 --> 21:12.150
Oh, that's right.

21:12.330 --> 21:12.931
That's right.

21:13.031 --> 21:14.012
That's right.

21:14.032 --> 21:14.573
I missed it.

21:15.194 --> 21:16.155
All right.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.877
The rest of them, it was hot.

21:18.920 --> 21:31.213
So you stayed there that first summer and went to summer school at A&M, and then your sophomore year, and you said you'd had some grade troubles your freshman year.

21:31.273 --> 21:33.316
Did you have any grade troubles after that?

21:33.876 --> 21:35.698
With English.

21:35.718 --> 21:37.020
It continued to be a problem.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.802
It continued to be a problem.

21:39.122 --> 21:42.025
And then end of my sophomore year,

21:42.140 --> 21:45.726
I got a job with the state forestry.

21:45.746 --> 21:45.887
Oh.

21:46.227 --> 21:50.254
Which had a, they had a forestry at Kirbyville, E.O.

21:50.274 --> 21:51.456
Seeky State Park.

21:51.717 --> 21:55.103
And old man Seeky gave me a job and I worked there.

21:55.544 --> 21:56.385
What'd you do?

21:56.753 --> 21:58.456
I was a caretaker.

21:58.476 --> 22:02.924
They had rented out the, it was an old CC camp.

22:02.944 --> 22:08.193
And they rented it out for camps, girl camps and such as that.

22:09.455 --> 22:13.682
So you began to accumulate a little more money.

22:13.662 --> 22:14.383
Yes, sir.

22:14.403 --> 22:19.688
Now, did your parents help pay for, or did you earn all of your college money?

22:20.229 --> 22:22.131
My parents didn't pay for any.

22:22.151 --> 22:23.352
They were not able.

22:23.372 --> 22:25.054
All right, so your older brother.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.976
Older brother and what I earned.

22:27.957 --> 22:31.521
And did you have a job your second, third, fourth years?

22:31.821 --> 22:34.244
Yes, sir, these that I mentioned.

22:34.744 --> 22:40.170
About how many, was it unusual for a student to have a job, or did many students have jobs?

22:40.671 --> 22:42.032
A lot of students had jobs.

22:43.548 --> 22:44.649
You mentioned wealth.

22:44.749 --> 22:49.154
Were there any Aggies in your day that everybody knew was rich?

22:50.876 --> 22:51.817
Well, we had one.

22:54.179 --> 22:57.663
I was in Perrier, which was a coastal artillery.

22:57.763 --> 22:58.984
Calvary was in law.

23:00.145 --> 23:10.476
There was one student in law hall that we all knew had money because he had a car and he had more than one set of boots.

23:10.496 --> 23:13.099
About how many students had cars?

23:15.560 --> 23:16.842
Well, that's hard to predict.

23:17.904 --> 23:21.710
I'd say maybe 40 or 50.

23:22.472 --> 23:24.195
Did anybody in your outfit have a car?

23:24.956 --> 23:25.837
No, sir.

23:25.857 --> 23:27.821
Not that I know of.

23:27.841 --> 23:33.290
Do you remember how many of your freshmen came back as sophomores?

23:33.310 --> 23:34.632
How many survived?

23:37.784 --> 23:40.306
I think we all came back except about five.

23:40.607 --> 23:41.267
Oh, that's good.

23:41.968 --> 23:42.468
That's good.

23:44.550 --> 23:52.838
The extracurricular groups then, the band, what did you and your buddies think about the Aggie band?

23:53.499 --> 23:55.681
Oh, we liked them here.

23:55.941 --> 23:57.683
Did you all make fun of them and tease them?

23:57.703 --> 23:58.003
No, sir.

23:59.725 --> 24:01.486
We didn't.

24:02.787 --> 24:04.369
Were the singing cadets going then?

24:05.110 --> 24:05.530
Yes, sir.

24:06.202 --> 24:22.118
uh and uh if if uh you what were the high prestige positions for a student if you could have been anything ross volunteers i was not a ross volunteer but that was

24:22.790 --> 24:26.196
And the highest student position was to be corps commander?

24:26.336 --> 24:27.979
Yes, sir.

24:28.781 --> 24:30.544
And you all respected then.

24:31.105 --> 24:36.354
Did you ever hear anything about secret fraternities when you were a student?

24:36.374 --> 24:36.715
No, sir.

24:38.011 --> 24:39.934
I haven't run into anybody that did.

24:40.074 --> 24:40.995
What about Yale leader?

24:41.055 --> 24:42.838
Was that an honor?

24:42.898 --> 24:44.540
That was an honor, yes, sir.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.603
Did y'all ever play tricks on the Yale leaders?

24:46.623 --> 24:49.567
I didn't.

24:50.769 --> 24:53.593
All right, so let's go up now.

24:54.294 --> 25:03.968
When the war started in Europe in 1939, did you and your buddies begin to talk about what it might mean to you?

25:05.197 --> 25:08.702
Just because we all had to register back at home, you know, and had our number.

25:09.423 --> 25:10.224
Your draft number?

25:10.364 --> 25:12.767
Draft number.

25:12.787 --> 25:15.390
But you got a deferment because you were at A&M.

25:16.312 --> 25:21.919
Yeah, I had my commission, and I got a year's deferment, and it almost lasted a year.

25:21.939 --> 25:23.120
It didn't quite last a year.

25:23.621 --> 25:32.773
Do you remember, describe please, if you can, your memory of how you heard the news on December 7th, 1941.

25:33.850 --> 25:36.220
I was living in Milner Hall at that time.

25:37.847 --> 25:39.032
And I heard it that morning.

25:41.222 --> 25:42.587
Where were you?

25:43.150 --> 25:43.692
In the dorm?

25:43.992 --> 25:44.473
Yes, sir.

25:44.493 --> 25:46.054
Did somebody come down the hallway?

25:46.255 --> 25:48.337
No, on the radio.

25:48.357 --> 25:50.259
Did you turn your radio on and listen?

25:50.279 --> 25:51.280
Yes, sir.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.902
What did you all think that might mean?

25:53.943 --> 25:54.985
Well, we knew what it meant.

25:56.466 --> 26:05.036
We were going to be called in service because all my class had already, when they finished, they went in, the ones that took a four-year course.

26:05.557 --> 26:05.697
Mm-hmm.

26:07.010 --> 26:12.541
And you were still in the Coast Artillery.

26:17.230 --> 26:22.700
Did everything, did the whole Corps get more serious after that?

26:27.610 --> 26:28.191
Well.

26:28.627 --> 26:30.490
I don't know much about the Corps.

26:30.610 --> 26:33.133
I wasn't there.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.518
Oh, you were not in the Corps that fifth year?

26:36.658 --> 26:36.879
No.

26:37.159 --> 26:37.700
Oh, I see.

26:37.940 --> 26:38.581
Oh, okay.

26:40.684 --> 26:44.409
What was it like going through Final Review your fourth year?

26:45.912 --> 26:47.193
Oh, well, we was all proud.

26:47.474 --> 26:49.837
We all had our boots and we was all proud.

26:50.538 --> 26:51.900
How much did your boots cost?

26:52.555 --> 26:54.017
I think mine cost $65.

26:54.718 --> 26:55.279
Were they new?

26:55.559 --> 26:56.220
Yes, sir.

26:56.240 --> 26:56.881
I still got them.

26:57.562 --> 26:58.302
And you bought them at?

26:58.723 --> 26:59.304
Hollicks.

26:59.324 --> 27:00.425
Hollicks.

27:00.445 --> 27:04.471
And so they were tailor-made for you.

27:05.151 --> 27:10.879
What went in your heart when you put on those boots the first time?

27:13.402 --> 27:17.888
Well, I remember the first time I went home with them, when the first time I went home with them,

27:18.712 --> 27:21.117
I couldn't get them off and had to get my daddy to help me.

27:21.178 --> 27:27.371
And my daddy, when he'd been over and I put my leg between his and pushed on him, he said, son, I did show them boots.

27:27.552 --> 27:32.523
And by then you had your ring.

27:32.844 --> 27:33.224
Yes, sir.

27:33.245 --> 27:34.387
How much did it cost?

27:37.053 --> 27:37.935
I don't remember.

27:38.911 --> 27:40.714
Do you have any ring stories?

27:41.255 --> 27:42.457
Have you ever lost it?

27:42.537 --> 27:42.818
Yes, sir.

27:42.838 --> 27:46.784
I lost one in Europe.

27:46.804 --> 27:49.930
That's my second one, and it's about wore out.

27:49.950 --> 27:50.771
How did you lose it?

27:50.811 --> 27:51.212
Do you know?

27:51.472 --> 27:52.514
I don't know.

27:52.775 --> 27:54.477
If I knew where I lost it, I wouldn't got it.

27:54.497 --> 27:56.361
Do you have about where were you?

27:56.821 --> 27:57.202
Africa.

27:57.603 --> 27:58.084
In Africa?

27:59.185 --> 28:01.990
And so you got this one after you got back?

28:02.090 --> 28:03.653
After I got back, yes, sir.

28:03.768 --> 28:09.319
Have you ever had anybody in some interesting places notice it, recognize that it's an Aggie ring?

28:09.460 --> 28:12.626
Oh, yeah, all the time.

28:12.646 --> 28:14.550
Of course, I recognize this more than I do that.

28:14.570 --> 28:15.111
There you go.

28:15.271 --> 28:15.833
There you go.

28:20.141 --> 28:21.484
What are you going to do with that ring?

28:21.785 --> 28:22.907
What do you want done with it?

28:26.633 --> 28:27.174
I don't know.

28:27.214 --> 28:30.479
I'm going to leave that up to my wife, if she's still living.

28:30.579 --> 28:31.461
Okay.

28:31.481 --> 28:31.861
All right.

28:32.542 --> 28:38.071
I'd be glad to give it to the university if they wound it, but I mean, they got several 41 rings.

28:38.692 --> 28:47.967
See, among the things that's happening with young people today, except at schools like A&M, is nobody's wearing a ring anymore.

28:47.947 --> 28:51.676
that the average school, the kids don't wear rings.

28:52.478 --> 29:02.542
But that to me is one of the key parts of A&M pride is that the students today are as proud to wear the Aggie ring as you and your classmates were.

29:02.562 --> 29:03.724
Oh, I look forward to it.

29:03.765 --> 29:04.386
I've had...

29:04.366 --> 29:06.492
I've had three grandchildren finish A&M.

29:06.512 --> 29:07.334
There you go.

29:07.354 --> 29:08.396
Very proud when they finish.

29:08.417 --> 29:09.219
There you go.

29:09.239 --> 29:09.660
Let's see.

29:09.920 --> 29:13.650
The project houses were there when you were a student.

29:13.871 --> 29:14.813
Yes, sir.

29:14.953 --> 29:19.405
Describe them and the students as far as you know.

29:19.705 --> 29:23.310
I know much about them because I never did live in one.

29:23.450 --> 29:24.832
Those were the poor boys.

29:25.813 --> 29:29.258
Could you have lived in a project house as far as you know if you had tried?

29:29.898 --> 29:33.623
Kirbyville had a chance.

29:34.304 --> 29:39.331
I thought I was going to have to live in one my freshman year.

29:39.411 --> 29:42.675
I got in the dorm just before school started.

29:43.076 --> 29:45.679
I was one of the last ones that they accepted in the dorms.

29:47.836 --> 29:51.061
Did you ever have a date while you were an undergraduate?

29:52.803 --> 29:53.484
Yes sir.

29:53.684 --> 29:54.806
How did you get that date?

29:55.787 --> 29:56.768
I was a hometown girl.

29:57.409 --> 30:01.675
And how did she get over to College Station?

30:02.957 --> 30:06.682
At that time I had a boy from A&M and had a car and he brought her.

30:07.343 --> 30:10.047
And where did she stay?

30:11.528 --> 30:17.038
I don't remember which dorm, but they evacuated the dorm and let the girls stay in the dorm.

30:17.278 --> 30:19.362
And do you remember what she came for?

30:19.402 --> 30:20.965
Was it a dance?

30:21.065 --> 30:22.889
Oh, it was a football game.

30:24.011 --> 30:26.696
And did Aggies kiss their dates then at football games?

30:26.756 --> 30:28.379
Yes, sir.

30:28.940 --> 30:30.963
How did Aggies treat young women then?

30:32.426 --> 30:34.009
I think they treated them very nice.

30:35.812 --> 30:36.993
And at the dances?

30:37.854 --> 30:39.476
Well, I didn't attend many dances.

30:39.576 --> 30:40.016
Oh, that's right.

30:40.036 --> 30:42.058
You said you weren't a dancer.

30:42.079 --> 30:45.882
I'm not a dancer.

30:46.043 --> 30:49.086
Then this young Kirbyville lady, did you see her again?

30:49.106 --> 30:51.268
Oh, yeah.

30:52.349 --> 30:56.453
I dated until I went into service.

30:56.473 --> 30:58.095
I was married while I was in service.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.118
Uh-oh.

31:01.659 --> 31:01.819
Uh-oh.

31:03.301 --> 31:05.164
Was Pinky Downs around in those?

31:05.184 --> 31:05.505
Yes, sir.

31:05.805 --> 31:07.729
Describe Pinky.

31:07.749 --> 31:10.714
Well, I never didn't know Pinky too well, but he was there.

31:11.415 --> 31:12.517
And he was... He knew about it.

31:12.657 --> 31:16.183
And he circulated around... Oh, yeah.

31:16.203 --> 31:18.467
How often did you go to Bryan?

31:19.690 --> 31:20.511
Didn't ever go.

31:21.212 --> 31:23.436
Maybe one time a semester.

31:24.648 --> 31:28.133
Was Uncle Ed's inexistent then, hard liquors?

31:28.153 --> 31:30.196
Yes, sir, but I didn't go because I didn't drink.

31:30.877 --> 31:33.201
And that was a place where Aggies went to drink beer, though?

31:33.221 --> 31:34.543
Yes, sir.

31:34.563 --> 31:36.466
Was Whiskey Bridge already?

31:37.046 --> 31:39.811
Could you go across towards Snook and buy whiskey then?

31:40.431 --> 31:40.892
I don't know.

31:41.012 --> 31:41.313
I didn't.

31:41.854 --> 31:44.017
You were, being a Baptist, you weren't a drinker?

31:44.217 --> 31:45.519
I wasn't a drinker.

31:45.579 --> 31:48.483
Did you ever hear any talk about a bootlegger?

31:48.824 --> 31:50.546
Nobody's ever told me about a bootlegger.

31:50.566 --> 31:51.007
No, sir.

31:51.027 --> 31:52.950
I don't know of anyone.
