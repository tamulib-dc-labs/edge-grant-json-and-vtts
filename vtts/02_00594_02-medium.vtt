Would you care to evaluate council's support of 
you in that situation and why you think they acted

00:02.782 --> 00:09.330
as they did? Well, I think that most members of 
council are generally not as strong-willed as I

00:09.350 --> 00:15.437
am. And a number of them are more tolerant of 
disorderliness than I am and expressed to me the

00:15.817 --> 00:30.595
fact that they were very willing to proceed with 
that council meeting in a very disorderly

00:15.817 --> 00:30.595
environment. That would be the case under any 
circumstances. I've seen some of the same ones

00:33.616 --> 00:42.108
proceed in annexation hearings where there was a 
great amount of disorder, and it's just a

00:33.616 --> 00:42.108
difference of opinion. What do you think the role 
of a city is when it comes to annexation and the

00:42.909 --> 00:50.219
rights of a city that doesn't want to be annexed? 
Well, we don't annex other cities. Each city has

00:52.683 --> 00:56.548
its own powers, and one city cannot annex another 
one. We only annex areas in our extraterritorial

00:57.018 --> 01:03.266
jurisdiction that are unincorporated. And I 
think our role is well defined by state law that we

01:04.587 --> 01:18.745
are required to prepare service plans to assure 
that the area that we're going to annex will be

01:04.587 --> 01:18.745
provided with adequate city services. We're 
required to hold public hearings in the area to be

01:18.825 --> 01:24.032
annexed to explain those service plans. And that 
is what we comply with. At what point do you think

01:28.000 --> 01:29.983
Houston will stop annexing? At the point when we 
stop growing, which I hope will not happen because

01:31.965 --> 01:42.779
the growth of the city has been good for the people 
who live here. And so I do not see annexation as a

01:43.821 --> 01:48.627
finite kind of situation. So then, by definition, 
annexation would be good for the people who

01:49.248 --> 01:53.053
annexed also? Yes. I think that... The fact that 
Texas annexation laws provide for a city to expand

01:56.840 --> 02:22.459
its city limits to include the population base so 
that all of the population base shares one tax base

01:56.840 --> 02:22.459
and one service base have been very good and have 
kept us from suffering from the problems of other

01:56.840 --> 02:22.459
cities, particularly in the Northeast, in which 
the the people or the taxpayers and the wealth has

02:22.709 --> 02:34.003
all left the inner city and gone into suburban 
cities and left the inner city with a

02:22.709 --> 02:34.003
deteriorating tax base that couldn't support 
itself. Finally, the Houston Oilers have done a

02:34.023 --> 02:39.349
good job of ruining the city's image. What do you 
plan on doing about the Houston Oilers? Are they

02:42.533 --> 02:44.295
working against your administration? Are they 
trying to ruin things for you? What do you see as

02:46.678 --> 02:48.100
solving the problem? If they run off Roe Campbell, 
I'll think that they're working against this

02:48.120 --> 02:52.345
administration. But I thought the best way we 
could solve the problem was by having a successful

02:52.882 --> 02:57.851
team at the University of Houston. However, other 
than the basketball team, we haven't managed to

02:58.892 --> 03:04.462
accomplish that as yet. But we'll wait until next 
year. We will then. Wait until next year. Thank you

03:07.507 --> 03:08.549
very much. Okay. Thank you.
