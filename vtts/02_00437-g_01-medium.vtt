WEBVTT

00:04.182 --> 00:05.224
inevitable decision. First, as an educational 
institution,

00:05.304 --> 00:27.726
I think it was proper that a young man in this 
country that wanted to go to college, and

00:05.304 --> 00:27.726
particularly right out of high school,

00:05.304 --> 00:27.726
if he didn't want to enter military training at 
that particular time. I don't think it should be

00:31.119 --> 00:32.941
forced on them. This, to me, serves a little bit to 
be like a dictatorship. There are some people that

00:40.010 --> 00:44.396
will never be military people. Let's recognize 
it. Everybody can't be an engineer. Everybody

00:47.560 --> 00:49.663
can't be a general. Everybody can't be a doctor.

00:54.267 --> 00:57.833
Some people are born to be military, and they're 
going to be. I just think it's right. You have a

01:00.336 --> 01:03.361
choice, and that's the basis of our country. Free 
enterprise isn't a democracy. Choice, you have

01:06.386 --> 01:07.928
freedom of choice. Okay, how about allowing women 
to go there for the first time? I definitely agree

01:12.175 --> 01:14.438
with that. As a matter of fact, let's talk about 
that a minute. I'm glad you asked this question.

01:26.903 --> 01:40.835
What was the expression you used when you asked me a 
question a few moments ago about the attitude of

01:26.903 --> 01:40.835
some civilians that you call a military 
mentality?

01:43.418 --> 01:55.088
I think that to

01:43.418 --> 01:55.088
have a school set up as we have in the past for men 
only, this is part of the the concept you're

01:55.456 --> 01:58.601
talking about, military, and I told you it had 
changed. Look at all the academies now. Sure. Look

02:00.965 --> 02:05.613
at the increased

02:00.965 --> 02:05.613
recruiting of women. Sure. Incredible. And 
furthermore, what's wrong? God made men and women

02:12.484 --> 02:15.288
to communicate and live together. What's wrong 
with this?

02:19.856 --> 02:20.637
I think it's great. Furthermore, it's only 
natural at an educational institution now to

02:21.157 --> 02:29.668
learn to live with a woman as a kid, as a youngster, 
as a teenager, as a young man. It's only natural.

02:31.751 --> 02:35.556
Now, when you're talking about recruiting women 
in the armed forces, this is a different question.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.939
I know it's a different question, and let's shift 
to that now. You favor the switch of women to A&M.

02:41.704 --> 02:49.915
Now,

02:41.704 --> 02:49.915
do you favor increasing the number of women in the 
Air Force? I think we've just about, in time of

02:50.654 --> 03:10.801
peace, and even planning for military 
organization, you know, a 100% man unit that's

02:50.654 --> 03:10.801
supposed to be conceived as an outfit ready to go to 
combat, I think we've just about approached the

02:50.654 --> 03:10.801
point of the percentage of women in the armed 
forces. As a matter of fact, it's already being,

03:10.821 --> 03:13.825
it's coming to the surface. There's many current

03:19.139 --> 03:29.410
officers say of colonel nature that much much 
younger than I and a lot of my advantage that

03:19.139 --> 03:29.410
already they see the limitations. We've almost 
exceeded limitations. To try to and look at the

03:31.653 --> 03:35.477
legislation that's begun to bubble. Limitations 
to try to what? To limitations to be applied to

03:37.960 --> 03:42.185
women where they shouldn't be in combat. This is 
wrong. Wait a minute. You think I'm confused. You

03:48.311 --> 03:48.792
think that allowing women into the service is 
right, but you feel, and I don't know if I'm putting

03:49.362 --> 04:05.021
words in your mouth, but just for clarification, 
you think allowing women into the service is

03:49.362 --> 04:05.021
right, but allowing, but having women 
participate in combat is wrong. That's right.

04:05.521 --> 04:09.206
They have a, again, let's go back to leadership. 
What did I say? Putting people in positions in

04:10.387 --> 04:15.113
accordance with their weaknesses and strengths. 
Okay. You're not going to put women in the front

04:16.160 --> 04:19.965
line of a professional football team, are you? Why 
don't we recruit them and put them in there? That's

04:22.668 --> 04:23.529
foolish. I've been in the infantry. I've been in 
the artillery. I've been in fighter airplanes.

04:28.616 --> 04:35.424
Actually, I know in Russia, in Russia, they 
actually use some women in fighter airplanes at

04:28.616 --> 04:35.424
the front. But this was in wartime when a country 
was fighting for its life and had over a generation

04:35.684 --> 04:44.175
of people, young people killed in that. nation. 20 
million people killed in World War II. They had to

04:48.027 --> 04:49.449
use people. Now we use women as transport pilots 
and ferrying aircraft in World War II and turned

04:51.072 --> 04:59.803
out great, but that's a support role. Women can do 
some jobs in support roles, in my opinion, better

04:59.963 --> 05:05.671
than men. Let's use them there. Let's use them in 
support roles, but let's don't ever until that,

05:14.092 --> 05:17.415
you know, we're about ready to lose our nation. 
Let's don't plan on using women in combat. I agree.

05:23.141 --> 05:28.807
You've heard of General Senglob, who was recalled 
from Korea and practically fired by President

05:23.141 --> 05:28.807
Carter. Oh, yeah. I knew him as a colonel in 
Southeast Asia. And I agree with him that women in

05:34.793 --> 05:44.082
combat, as a matter of fact, the extent that we 
visualize eventually increasing percentage of

05:34.793 --> 05:44.082
women in armed forces, I think deserves a new look. 
And here again, you know, I said that the armed

05:46.276 --> 05:53.428
forces reflect the culture and the 
characteristics of our civilian population.

05:55.631 --> 06:00.419
Look at the duplication of soldiers you have to 
make to treat women the way we in America are taught

05:55.631 --> 06:00.419
to treat women. Ladies and gentlemen, look at the 
duplication of soldiers you have to have. There's

06:05.347 --> 06:07.751
just many reasons. In times of emergency, That's a 
different thing. Yeah, but in the general

06:13.348 --> 06:20.575
peacetime services, you think mostly their role 
should be one of support. I definitely agree. As a

06:22.497 --> 06:33.607
matter of fact, even further, I don't know whether 
you get to this or not, but I've been doing a lot of

06:22.497 --> 06:33.607
thinking about the

06:22.497 --> 06:33.607
draft. And, you know, even the courts got involved 
in this. Sure. The Congress is involved in it.

06:41.117 --> 06:44.381
We're almost at the point where we're trying to 
legislate social life. I definitely, I believe in

06:45.963 --> 06:48.947
the draft. Okay, you believe in the draft. Oh yeah, 
there's no doubt about it. Matter of fact, I think

06:52.371 --> 07:02.083
it's the old American tradition and culture that

06:52.371 --> 07:02.083
the American man has a responsibility toward his 
country. This is the basis of patriotism. and I

07:04.184 --> 07:06.347
believe it's still there. What about drafting 
women? That's the point I'm going to make. I don't

07:11.153 --> 07:25.352
think the number of women that I foresee being in 
the armed forces and the role they'll play, I don't

07:11.153 --> 07:25.352
think that it's necessary to lay on a draft for 
women. But I think and respect the women and the men

07:25.372 --> 07:34.123
of this country equally alike, and I think that in 
time of emergency, you'll have enough young women

07:34.373 --> 07:40.619
that are ready to volunteer to fill their quota in 
the armed forces. I don't think you have the

07:40.640 --> 07:42.822
problem. And also, in the support role, generally 
speaking, it doesn't take as much time to train

07:42.842 --> 07:50.109
people in that role. To train a combat pilot, that 
takes time. Also, to train a crack maintenance

07:53.693 --> 07:58.898
man, electronic equipment, this takes time. Now, 
some women can do that. But generally speaking,

08:00.901 --> 08:03.283
the proportion of women that, let's say, we'd have 
to get in the service in time of emergency. I think

08:08.214 --> 08:14.102
that wouldn't be so critical, but now, men, that's 
a different thing. You've got to get the men

08:14.122 --> 08:15.223
aboard. We should have a draft. I definitely 
agree. Okay, now, during the time that you were in

08:17.486 --> 08:22.533
the military, of course, they integrated the 
services. Truman issued, I think it was Executive

08:23.094 --> 08:31.785
Order 9066 in 1947,

08:23.094 --> 08:31.785
integrating desegregating the armed forces. 
What was your opinion on that? Desegregation.

08:37.972 --> 08:39.134
Sure. Integrated units. I think that the 
desegregation and the elimination of what we

08:40.796 --> 09:00.321
consider the minority in this country, the armed 
forces should be patted on the back and

08:40.796 --> 09:00.321
complimented from a standpoint of human rights in 
being the forerunner of this. Maybe, let's say by

09:02.418 --> 09:05.402
edict, they had to do it, of course. But I think it 
was a great idea. I think the Armed Forces was far

09:07.845 --> 09:16.796
ahead of the civilians of this nation, of this 
country, in this area, that they're not

09:07.845 --> 09:16.796
comfortable.

09:16.816 --> 09:17.637
Okay, and... I'm all for it. And during your term, 
or your career in the service, did you have any

09:19.720 --> 09:28.030
racial problems that you remember You're sitting 
here in charge of the 12th in 1967 and 1968, and

09:30.237 --> 09:40.951
these were pretty hot times in the cities, and 
there were black riots in the cities. Did you have

09:40.971 --> 09:42.714
any racial problems at all? I don't remember, and I 
must have to think a few minutes. I don't remember

09:48.081 --> 09:53.008
having one single racial problem, frankly, in my 
entire military career. In your entire military

09:53.689 --> 09:54.970
career? I don't remember. Now, I've read of them. I 
certainly read of them, you know, about them in the

09:58.790 --> 10:04.699
South Asian War and overseas. I read of them 
recently on board naval vessels at sea. I've read

10:09.246 --> 10:13.934
about these and again, I go back to my statement. 
The Armed Forces reflect the culture and nature

10:13.954 --> 10:19.843
and characteristics of civilians. It's 
certainly in worse than it is in civilian, but I

10:23.680 --> 10:32.394
think if you have a tendency to have these types of 
problems in the civilian world, in the United

10:23.680 --> 10:32.394
States, you have to have the same type of problems 
in the military. But you didn't have any. I don't

10:34.237 --> 10:35.919
recall having any. Is this, well, let's go back to 
what the previous question we were talking about.

10:42.069 --> 10:46.256
The armed forces were ahead of the world in 
integration. And you supported them. Oh, I

10:47.858 --> 10:51.544
remember having, in South Carolina, Shaw Air 
Force Base. I remember having colored officers,

10:53.159 --> 11:04.393
blacks, in my outfit and sitting next to them in the 
officer's club dining. And those people

11:04.994 --> 11:07.176
understood it. They would have their fellow 
blacks sit at a table next to us. There was no

11:13.124 --> 11:14.005
problem. They understood it as well as we did, and 
both worked towards solving this problem. I

11:19.388 --> 11:23.734
honestly can't remember any big flag. I remember 
little bitty spats. Oh, I remember maybe a black

11:25.516 --> 11:30.203
and an airman having a beer at the NCO because they 
might get in a fight. But why wouldn't it spread

11:30.704 --> 11:34.168
with all the blacks and whites? We never did. I 
don't remember any real big promise. So what

11:38.614 --> 11:43.401
you're saying is that with every command that 
you've been at, the blacks in the command and the

11:43.938 --> 11:54.632
whites in the command that were integrated in all 
the time, they worked together to decrease racial

11:43.938 --> 11:54.632
tensions, or is that putting words in your mouth? 
Sir, as a matter of fact, I'm aware of what you're

11:54.752 --> 12:03.044
talking about, and I gave it up to the time I got in 
command position. I always gave this

12:03.064 --> 12:09.372
consideration and high priority that I went out of 
my way to walk across the officer's club lounge to

12:09.807 --> 12:13.992
shake hands with a black officer and his wife. So it 
ended along with my wife. I worked at it, but I never

12:16.555 --> 12:21.901
felt any stress to have to do this. I don't remember 
a problem in this area. Great, great. Now, as far as

12:25.506 --> 12:30.732
women, women were joining in the 1960s, 
especially in the 1970s. The military passed in

12:30.752 --> 12:32.654
the never before. We've already talked about your 
ideas in the draft. Did you ever have any problems

12:34.797 --> 12:39.122
with the new women who were coming in in the 
enlisted ranks or the officer ranks? Did you have

12:44.447 --> 12:48.011
an increase, especially in the 12th when you were 
there? Women, laughs.

12:55.700 --> 13:09.295
The only problem I can remember, again, in my 
career with respect to women in the services, at

12:55.700 --> 13:09.295
McCord Air Force Base, when I report front of their 
division with my I remember we were increasing. As

13:13.361 --> 13:20.810
a matter of fact, when I arrived at the base, there 
was a barracks, a special dormitory set aside for

13:13.361 --> 13:20.810
WAFs. And this is the first time I came up against 
anything like this. This was in 1950. Well, when I

13:27.097 --> 13:31.042
reported it to Hamlet in 1957. Something like 
that. But I'll figure something out. If I remember

13:39.515 --> 13:49.047
correctly, there were some problems about

13:39.515 --> 13:49.047
some of the airmen. 57. 57. There were some 
problems about some of the airmen. Oh, it was a

13:54.314 --> 13:56.156
matter of off-limits.

13:58.779 --> 13:59.500
That's what it was. When I arrived, there were 
off-limits signs posted around the WAF barracks.

14:05.975 --> 14:09.820
And this was the first time I'd come across any 
faces. And of course, I didn't do anything about it

14:10.561 --> 14:15.628
immediately, but I wondered why and all, you know. 
And it was a claim to me that the, well, you know, it

14:15.648 --> 14:22.456
was the first time I'd had anything like this. And 
there's so many on this base that sometime the

14:26.748 --> 14:42.610
airmen, you know, they'd get mixed up and the 
airmen would come over here and you'd get caught in

14:26.748 --> 14:42.610
the barracks and everything going on being 
scandalous, you know, and they had to find it off

14:26.748 --> 14:42.610
limits so that the airmen knew they'd be plenty to 
be came on to the dormitory. And I was surprised to

14:42.630 --> 14:46.856
hear this. I didn't do anything at the time, but as 
time went on, I think really, I didn't do anything

14:55.267 --> 14:56.648
solid. I think experience and time solved the 
problem, and these things faded away, and

14:56.668 --> 15:04.256
eventually those signs were taken down. It wasn't 
an insurmountable problem. You know, you had a

15:08.460 --> 15:14.166
little concern about it for a while, but to my 
knowledge, that's the only time I remember. Oh, I

15:15.087 --> 15:18.911
remember another time when I was in Thailand.

15:20.313 --> 15:24.717
I forget her position, but she was general, 
general home, HRLMS. She was a female general in

15:25.068 --> 15:27.351
Thailand? Right, right. In the Air Force? No, she 
was in the Air Force headquarters in personnel,

15:28.712 --> 15:33.818
but she was the head of the... One-star general? 
Yeah. I believe she was a one-star general when she

15:36.421 --> 15:38.984
came over to visit. You know, she was making a tour 
in the area, just like any other staff officer from

15:39.004 --> 15:47.154
the Pentagon. And we talked about...

15:53.080 --> 16:22.530
women you know being introduced over there in the 
units in the in the combat theater and that was a

15:53.080 --> 16:22.530
problem that i'd never thought well it was a 
question was brought up i never thought before and

15:53.080 --> 16:22.530
uh when he brought up idea i said i don't know i have 
to give this some thought and we discussed it and

15:53.080 --> 16:22.530
talked about it and actually she was all for the 
idea see uh i didn't i didn't have a position at oh

15:53.080 --> 16:22.530
and support definitely you know and warehouse you 
know Definitely not being in combat. We weren't

16:24.674 --> 16:26.678
near that forward thing yet. Not even she. But

16:28.462 --> 16:42.493
I don't think the question ever was posed to me 
again prior

16:28.462 --> 16:42.493
to the time I rotated and came back home. But I don't 
ever recall, I don't think we ever saw any women

16:42.929 --> 16:47.314
over there during the war. But she didn't have an 
opinion? I mean, you saw the pros and cons, but you

16:48.916 --> 16:51.899
didn't... At that time? You didn't tell her? No, 
no, no. As a matter of fact, I thought about it a lot,

16:54.402 --> 17:10.320
and I thought about it a lot after that, and this is 
the reason I'm telling you right now,

16:54.402 --> 17:10.320
categorically, if they do go anyplace, and 
thinking about, based on my experience over

16:54.402 --> 17:10.320
there, they ought to be in combat roles. I'd have 
been a little hard-pressed. Kind of think about

17:15.009 --> 17:17.533
it. Did we not put some labs in 7th Air Force 
Headquarters at Thompson News? I don't know. We

17:26.788 --> 17:30.974
may have, but that was, I don't remember 
specifically. It seemed like maybe we did try

17:30.994 --> 17:33.197
that. At any rate, not entirely. At least when I was 
over there, we did. But I'd have been reluctant.

17:41.131 --> 18:02.078
to, even at that time, to

17:41.131 --> 18:02.078
bring women in to those air bases in South Vietnam 
because of the type of warfare over there where the

17:41.131 --> 18:02.078
bases could be martyred, you know, every day and 
overrun and actually get in hand-to-hand combat

17:41.131 --> 18:02.078
right on the base. I'm horrified to the thought 
we're on a base

18:04.201 --> 18:10.429
in a WAP barracks. It taunts a note that women be 
confronted in barracks with invading Vietcongs

18:11.489 --> 18:20.300
with knives in their hands. In the end, it's 
expected in combat, not women. Okay, let's ask one

18:23.184 --> 18:36.000
last question about A&M, and that is,

18:23.184 --> 18:36.000
what are your feelings toward integrating A&M? In 
1968, we left the first blacks in the A&M, and now we

18:36.020 --> 18:40.686
have blacks equally, or not equally, but blacks 
going to A&M. And this is another one of those

18:46.340 --> 18:50.624
changes during General Rutter's time as a 
president. What's your idea? What's wrong with

18:52.226 --> 18:53.047
that? It should be done. That's across the board in 
this nation.

19:00.033 --> 19:03.196
The United States should be the forerunners in the 
world for human rights. And A&M, God bless the

19:04.418 --> 19:11.044
position it is and how proud we are of it, and the in 
the front ranks of supplying qualified officers

19:11.648 --> 19:22.244
and airmen to the armed forces, why not supply some 
qualified women to the armed forces? Amen. Let's

19:22.825 --> 19:23.686
go. I'm for it. And blacks. And blacks, 
definitely. Oh, absolutely. And minorities, if

19:28.113 --> 19:29.816
you will. Women and blacks, definitely. Do you 
think it's a better institution today with this

19:33.000 --> 19:39.951
tremendous expansion and all of these changes in 
the 1960s than it was a than it was when you went

19:40.218 --> 19:42.721
there after the Second World War? Well, Terry, I 
guess, truthfully, I ought to say I'm not sure. I'd

19:51.270 --> 19:59.239
have an opinion, but frankly, I can't answer that 
question, because I really don't, I haven't been

19:51.270 --> 19:59.239
on the campus of A&M in years and years. I don't 
know. But, thinking back on my experience, the

19:59.900 --> 20:07.288
bigger the outfit, the...

20:09.057 --> 20:31.774
greater the tendency to lose supervisory control 
and the more care you have to give and the more

20:09.057 --> 20:31.774
careful you have to pick your key people down the 
line to control as you release your detailed

20:09.057 --> 20:31.774
supervision from above and get bigger you have to 
delegate that supervision to the lower ones and if

20:09.057 --> 20:31.774
that's if A&M avoids these pitfalls of not, you 
know, delegating authority to maintain the

20:32.277 --> 20:57.982
discipline that they had when I was there, and

20:32.277 --> 20:57.982
I'm sure that it would be equal good, and I have all 
the confidence in the world, and I'll bet you, I'd

20:32.277 --> 20:57.982
say based on my respect for that place, that I'll 
bet you it's as good now as it was then. I'd be

20:58.002 --> 21:01.286
surprised if it wasn't. Well, I'm out of 
questions. We've talked about your career, your

21:03.267 --> 21:08.676
early years, A&M, leadership. Is there anything 
for the record that you'd like to say before we

21:08.696 --> 21:12.302
close? I mean, is there anything? You're the 
expert on your life. Is there anything that we've

21:15.267 --> 21:18.071
missed? That we missed? Well, I mean, any major 
changes or anything that you think that we should

21:20.756 --> 21:27.006
talk about? Do you want to see the transcript?

21:34.538 --> 21:45.412
Well, I could do that, but I could just say that if

21:34.538 --> 21:45.412
I had to do it over again, I'd do exactly what I did. 
I'd go to A&M as soon as I could. I'd get in the

21:49.257 --> 21:51.981
military as soon as I could. become a fighter pilot 
as soon as I could and I'd be in a burst war as soon as I

21:52.282 --> 22:21.107
could be that we got into I'd be there and I'd strive 
to be promoted up the ladder and be just as

21:52.282 --> 22:21.107
ambitious as I did before I loved it then and I still 
think

21:52.282 --> 22:21.107
I still think that the Air Force is the greatest 
organization in the world I'd do it again Well,

22:22.167 --> 22:23.892
that's an appropriate way to go.
