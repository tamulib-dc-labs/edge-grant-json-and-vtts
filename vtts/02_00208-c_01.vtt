WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:08.889
that he gave you, as you look back on it now, do you 
think that was appropriate advice? It was

00:08.909 --> 00:10.455
wonderful advice. I went up and went to work for the 
highway department back up close to home in

00:15.016 --> 00:16.238
Atlanta. The district office was located in 
Atlanta and I worked for them from January through

00:16.278 --> 00:31.022
May of the next year and transferred to the Bryan 
district because they knew I was going back to

00:16.278 --> 00:31.022
graduate school and it was a matter of 
convenience. Two district engineers getting

00:31.102 --> 00:35.409
together said let's move Walton to Bryan so you can 
go to graduate school and they paid for it. And then

00:36.130 --> 00:40.838
I worked for three months here in Bryan getting 
ready to go to graduate school. And Saul Wright

00:40.818 --> 00:49.990
told me I needed an attitude adjustment, and so I 
went and got that two-year attitude adjustment

00:40.818 --> 00:49.990
and changed direction a little bit. I was really 
going to come back in materials in the soils area. I

00:55.397 --> 01:01.965
had some profs in undergraduate school that had 
really, I thought, turned me on to what I wanted to

00:55.397 --> 01:01.965
do. I wanted in the general area of 
transportation, but I thought I'd specialize in

01:01.945 --> 01:06.153
soil. But I went to the highway department. I 
really came back in more pure transportation

01:07.636 --> 01:14.028
rather than materials. But in my time up at the 
highway department, I was very well prepared. I

01:19.818 --> 01:22.283
turned down a job offer with Exxon. Well, big 
money. I think I went to work for the highway

01:24.222 --> 01:30.069
department at $585 a month, and Exxon had offered 
me $700 a month. Texaco had offered me $700 a month.

01:32.692 --> 01:41.904
And so I was afraid, quite honestly, that had I 
taken either of those jobs with the two oil

01:32.692 --> 01:41.904
companies, I would have never come back. And I felt 
like going to work for the highway department, I

01:42.264 --> 01:46.650
would, in fact, come back, and I did. And to answer 
the question, was I prepared? There's no question

01:50.254 --> 01:51.696
I was prepared. Is there anything, looking back 
now with the clarity of hindsight, is there

01:52.435 --> 02:02.749
anything that you think A&M should have done more 
of or could have done better?

02:05.648 --> 02:13.304
Haskell, you know, yeah, when I consider my whole 
career and the fact that not only was I an

02:05.648 --> 02:13.304
undergraduate student here, but I went through a 
master's and a Ph.D. program here. Well, I've seen

02:13.324 --> 02:16.531
that, but primarily the undergraduate. Yeah, but 
when I look at my career as a master's and a Ph.D.

02:16.992 --> 02:25.750
student and as a professor and a dean here and the 
things we did in those time periods, and I look back

02:16.992 --> 02:25.750
as an undergraduate student, I can ask the 
question, why did so many students not make it in

02:25.730 --> 02:29.556
those days? And so could the university have done 
something more in those days? Perhaps so. Perhaps

02:35.425 --> 02:38.509
they could have done a better job of retention of 
the student. But were we admitting? That's a good

02:40.652 --> 02:42.014
question. No, no, there were a lot of them like old 
Ned, you know, coming from small high schools and

02:42.035 --> 02:50.287
preparation probably was not that good. And I 
don't know if the expectations were that high

02:51.008 --> 03:01.600
either, but I know the retention rate was not that 
good in those days, and a lot of students did not

02:51.008 --> 03:01.600
make it. So that's about the only thing I could say, 
Haskell, as far as having good quality in the

03:01.700 --> 03:08.167
classroom and good profs and what have you. I don't 
look back on my undergraduate days at all and say,

03:08.587 --> 03:13.072
boy, I had a bunch of lousy profs. Those guys were 
great. I will never forget. To which ones would you

03:15.995 --> 03:18.298
give the highest marks? I'm going to ask you the 
negative. Who are the ones that you now think did

03:20.197 --> 03:23.922
the best job? By name? Yeah. Oh, goodness. There 
are 10 or 12 profs that were just absolutely

03:27.126 --> 03:37.020
magnificent to me in my undergraduate days. And if 
I limit it to my pure civil engineering program, it

03:37.100 --> 03:48.235
has to be Neil Rowan, Wayne Dunlap, Ted Hirsch, 
Howard Furr, all four rather demanding but just

03:49.025 --> 03:59.861
exceptional teachers, exceptional teachers.

04:03.887 --> 04:12.079
There were a large number of other profs that I 
thoroughly enjoyed over in the supporting

04:03.887 --> 04:12.079
departments and what have you. But I'd have to say 
it was really in my department. I really didn't get

04:15.686 --> 04:18.788
turned on until I got to my department, quite 
honestly. And so those are the folks that I just

04:19.589 --> 04:28.477
felt like did an absolutely stupendous job in 
helping me and getting me prepared and knowing

04:19.589 --> 04:28.477
what was right. And they went to bat for me for 
graduate school. They were ready to see me in

04:31.440 --> 04:33.502
graduate school. Yeah, Walt and Ken as a graduate 
student at Texas A&M. So those are the guys that

04:39.187 --> 04:42.910
really made a particular impact on me as an 
undergraduate student. Other than the sheer

04:46.513 --> 04:51.200
academics, what else did you learn at Texas A&M?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.508
I really believe I learned teamwork. I really 
believe I learned how to live with other people and

04:56.528 --> 05:06.382
get along with other people and give and take and 
share and compromise and do those things that you

04:56.528 --> 05:06.382
have to do to live in a civilian society. I really 
believe I learned those things. I learned a good

05:09.046 --> 05:11.269
work ethic. There's no question that By the time 
you got through an A&M preparation in

05:13.568 --> 05:32.692
engineering, and I can't speak for the other 
departments, but I think it's probably about the

05:13.568 --> 05:32.692
same, but I really know that by the time I got out, 
there was a work ethic there, that you worked for

05:13.568 --> 05:32.692
what you got, and that if you did your work well, 
there was a reward there for you. And those things

05:33.653 --> 05:36.537
have not left me. I learned that at A&M, how to do 
teamwork, how to work together.

05:43.893 --> 05:57.331
If you were a consultant today to Texas A&M, 
whether it be A&M in general and or engineering,

05:43.893 --> 05:57.331
what advice would you give them about today and the 
future for Texas A&M? I would try to give them some

05:58.772 --> 06:09.867
help on how do we identify that youngster that we 
want and that belongs here.

06:11.213 --> 06:29.458
I hurt

06:11.213 --> 06:29.458
more on one thing than anything else in my total A&M 
experience, and that is knowing that today there

06:11.213 --> 06:29.458
are literally thousands of kids out there that 
want A&M so bad and they can't have it. And there's

06:30.552 --> 06:33.575
not a solution to that, Haskell, as far as I know. 
And I don't care what position I held out there. I

06:36.078 --> 06:40.683
couldn't solve that problem and say, okay, if you 
want to, you can have it. It's just not that way

06:40.703 --> 06:42.364
anymore. But I would try to give some help to them in 
identifying those students that will make it so

06:43.145 --> 06:55.078
that we have extremely high retention, give those 
kids the opportunity. I know when I went to the

06:57.000 --> 07:00.323
dean's office, we did some... tracking of high 
schools all across the state and we looked at SATs

07:01.366 --> 07:27.036
and high school grades and high school rank and 
extracurricular activities and all these sort of

07:01.366 --> 07:27.036
things and said okay what kids are successful to us 
and you know we'd see those kids with fourteen

07:01.366 --> 07:27.036
hundred fifteen hundred SAT scores bust out and 
not make it and you'd say well why and we'd try to go

07:01.366 --> 07:27.036
back and look and see why and then we'd see this this 
high school kid that uh... not necessarily a high

07:27.016 --> 07:31.224
SAT score, that was doing extremely well in our 
program. Why? And we tried to answer those

07:31.665 --> 07:33.950
questions. I think that I, and maybe there exists 
this already, I don't know. I'd put together a blue

07:40.122 --> 07:47.556
ribbon committee and say, people, let's look what 
it is out there that is the pool of Let's look at what

07:47.924 --> 07:57.162
we're really trying to do as a state institution, 
land grant institution, and all the other space

07:47.924 --> 07:57.162
grants and sea grants and everything else that we 
have. We do want to be the research institution as

07:57.763 --> 08:01.370
well as the academic institution. What is it out 
there for us that we really want to bring into our

08:01.791 --> 08:05.899
institution I don't know why it's not still a hit 
and miss to some extent. I may be wrong, but I think

08:09.745 --> 08:13.871
maybe it is still a hit and miss to some extent. I 
would try to really focus in on a real blue ribbon

08:13.891 --> 08:24.947
panel that could address those issues and try to do 
a better job of doing that. And quite honestly,

08:25.108 --> 08:30.736
Haskell, if we did that, I think diversity would 
take care of itself. I made a presentation a good

08:30.816 --> 08:35.363
number of years ago right after the Oh, the 
decision that... Hopwood. The Hopwood decision.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.285
I had an opportunity to speak to one of the honor 
societies at the university. And one of the

08:44.447 --> 08:58.966
questions that came to me after the presentation 
and question and answer period was, Dr. Walton,

08:44.447 --> 08:58.966
what do you think is, what do you think the impact of 
this decision is going to be? I said it only means

08:59.707 --> 09:02.932
it's a difference of how we identify students. It 
should be no more than that. We've just got to do a

09:05.903 --> 09:12.317
different job of identifying those students that 
we really need to bring to this campus. And the way

09:13.219 --> 09:18.630
we've been doing it, someone says it's the wrong 
way, so let's find a new way to do it. And Jim Yow, I

09:19.319 --> 09:21.883
don't know if you remember Jim Yow. Jim was head of 
the Civil Engineering Department at that time. We

09:24.707 --> 09:26.009
had a discussion afterwards. He kind of agreed 
with my basic premise there that, yes, we still can

09:26.069 --> 09:31.898
be diverse. We can still bring in the students that 
we want to bring in. We've just got to do a little bit

09:34.122 --> 09:38.548
different job of how we identify them and how we 
structure it. And again, I'm not too sure we've

09:39.290 --> 09:41.172
done that yet.

09:44.858 --> 09:47.402
What have we left out of your undergraduate days? I 
think we pretty well covered the undergraduate

09:48.563 --> 09:51.207
today. All right, then the last question is, what 
feelings do you carry in your heart today for Texas

09:51.347 --> 10:16.144
A&M?

10:16.164 --> 10:17.406
You know, they're very strong. hard to define.

10:30.550 --> 10:34.217
You want to give something back.

10:40.449 --> 10:41.571
You want to

10:54.646 --> 10:58.471
You still want to spend your last days as an Aggie, 
you know? You want to go to your grave as an Aggie,

10:59.172 --> 11:05.701
having never changed, no allegiance, nothing 
changes. You want your last days still to be an

11:06.782 --> 11:14.152
Aggie, and you want to share it, you know, with 
everyone that you can. There's just that part of

11:16.235 --> 11:22.223
belonging that... You've got to be one to know that 
you are one. I really believe that. You've got to be

11:27.125 --> 11:29.868
an Aggie to know what an Aggie is. I have very strong 
religious convictions in high school. I have very

11:35.454 --> 11:40.059
strong convictions about my family and 
dedication to my family. My dad taught me to, son,

11:42.141 --> 11:47.727
don't ever put anything before God. Your family 
comes after that, but then don't put anything in

11:48.848 --> 11:52.632
front of your family past that. And, man, I can pull 
A&M real close behind that. You know, it's church

11:55.894 --> 11:57.856
and family. Those Aggies come in a very strong 
third, you know. It's just wonderful to be an

12:01.721 --> 12:05.806
Aggie. Man, I wouldn't change anything. And I go 
back and I look. I have 15 very close relatives that

12:13.175 --> 12:22.146
are all A&M graduates and a daughter-in-law. 
that's an Aggie, makes number 16, and my wife has

12:22.126 --> 12:50.547
nine Aggies on her side, so we put my 16 and her nine 
together, that's 25 Aggies that are pretty much in

12:22.126 --> 12:50.547
the immediate family, and so we've got maroon 
blood, and so we're not gonna be in danger of any of

12:22.126 --> 12:50.547
us losing sight of what it means to be an Aggie, We 
all share those strong convictions about what it

12:51.438 --> 12:55.944
is. When I left here as an undergraduate, knowing I 
was coming back to graduate school, I could hardly

12:57.446 --> 13:03.393
wait to get back, quite honestly. It was hard for me 
to consider jobs outside of the A&M system. When I

13:11.705 --> 13:18.575
thought about getting a Ph.D. degree, Fred Bunsen 
had arranged for me to go two or three different

13:11.705 --> 13:18.575
places. I could have gone to Purdue. I could have 
gone to the University of Texas. I could have gone

13:21.360 --> 13:24.224
to Kansas State, his alma mater. And he said, why 
leave the best? And he says, when you get on the

13:27.248 --> 13:37.003
faculty here, he said, you're standing side by 
side to another applicant that's moving up the

13:27.248 --> 13:37.003
chain to tenure. He said, you just got to be a little 
bit better than that graduate from somewhere

13:37.557 --> 13:40.763
else. But he said, you'll get a shot at it. And he 
said, I'm going to tell you what. He said, the Aggie

13:43.749 --> 13:45.753
can be better every time. And I got a lot of 
encouragement from Fred Benson to do that. And so

13:50.041 --> 13:56.072
I've just got extremely deep feelings for A&M, not 
only from my undergraduate days, you've got to

13:56.339 --> 14:02.188
understand that it was more than undergraduate 
days for me and my relationship with A&M. It's just

14:02.588 --> 14:05.433
never-ending. That's great. I did skip one 
question, so this is a note to the typist. Move this

14:09.559 --> 14:12.944
one back before that last question. If you had the 
capacity to make a major gift to Texas A&M,

14:13.585 --> 14:22.498
somebody walks up to you and gives you a check for a 
million dollars and you've got to pass it on, if you

14:22.478 --> 14:27.485
could make a major contribution to Texas A&M, for 
what purpose would you want that gift used? What

14:27.666 --> 14:28.747
would be your favorite? Haskell, I am definite on 
what I would do right now. My brother and I

14:33.314 --> 14:36.439
established an endowed scholarship here. That's 
behind us. It would definitely go to the Texas A&M

14:39.122 --> 14:44.691
Press.

14:45.211 --> 14:47.395
You're talking about the press as it's now named? 
Yes. Really? There's no question. I'm in love with

14:50.187 --> 14:51.408
the press. How marvelous. I have enjoyed so much. I 
own a

14:56.533 --> 15:04.060
copy of every book that the press has ever 
published. There aren't many of us who do. I

15:06.062 --> 15:09.866
believe that reading is very fundamental.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.992
My little grandson is a very a very fine reader. I 
have just, and his mother's a teacher, is the

15:18.052 --> 15:22.980
reason that they encouraged it so much. But they 
did such a wonderful job. And I just, it would go to

15:26.206 --> 15:30.112
the Texas A&M Press. It would.
