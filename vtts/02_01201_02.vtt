WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:26.494
can't you just not you know we didn't yeah need the 
publicity we weren't looking to have our names

00:02.242 --> 00:26.494
before and frank said no that's not the way it's 
done he said that if you people know that you've

00:02.242 --> 00:26.494
done something that encourages other people to do 
it yeah that's right yeah he was really our master

00:02.242 --> 00:26.494
at that time and i think just the concept too is um 
Now let me ask

00:27.217 --> 00:39.767
you,

00:27.217 --> 00:39.767
had either of you much interest in art before this? 
Yes. Okay.

00:43.906 --> 00:48.596
Well, I've always been an artist, but I've always 
had art in my home. Most every home I've had has been

00:48.816 --> 00:53.686
photographed by somebody who don't. Okay, so you 
did have a strong sense. But I kind of asked that

00:57.293 --> 00:59.317
question to Lindsey. I said, well, do you ever 
really care about books? He said, no, I really

01:01.342 --> 01:02.845
don't care about books. He said, I like A&M. You 
know, and that's a good, fair answer. I was

01:06.734 --> 01:07.335
wondering about that. I'd say we did it for both. 
For both reasons, yeah. And I just really wondered

01:09.557 --> 01:12.080
if you had asked her. Well, she does. Yeah. Thanks. 
Well, the reason I asked you that, in fact, is that I

01:14.983 --> 01:25.734
really believe one of those letters in particular 
that Wardlaw and Roney wrote to you, or addressed

01:14.983 --> 01:25.734
them to you, is that you told them both of them. I 
kind of thought, well, you must have, there must be

01:25.754 --> 01:28.036
something there. I didn't mean to say that she has a 
definite eye. Has her eye. Mm-hmm. Well, that

01:33.907 --> 01:40.555
series has certainly been, I think, one of the 
brighter things in the whole press experience.

01:40.636 --> 01:44.340
And what's nice about it, you know, you can go on and 
on. It really adds. You can just multiply it and

01:46.463 --> 01:48.345
produce. That's really a great thing. Among the 
series, Frank

01:49.667 --> 01:57.137
Barbaugh said that. And Michael Perry said that. 
That was not as popular as ever. Yeah, yeah. He said

01:59.399 --> 02:03.745
that Frank had blamed himself over and over for 
deciding to do that for him. Because we kicked in

02:04.012 --> 02:07.357
another $25,000 to keep it going. Is that right? 
Yeah. You know, it's publishing a funny business.

02:13.064 --> 02:14.006
You can't call them all. It's kind of like our 
business. You can't call them all, can you? But

02:19.193 --> 02:22.918
that's how sincere he was. There's two things we 
could see. He was enthusiastic, and he was smart, I

02:25.661 --> 02:31.609
think. Any of you? I think I was also impressed that 
he had such a background of stuff that he wanted to

02:32.294 --> 02:44.929
do here that they didn't allow him to do. Of course, 
I know I knew records some places that when they

02:45.050 --> 02:53.079
talked him into coming to A&M, they did everything 
they promised. He didn't have to have a committee

02:53.159 --> 02:56.604
tell him what to do. He was very concerned about 
that always, and I know in his appropriations,

03:00.880 --> 03:04.004
That $200,000 revolving fund was so important to 
him. And it would be some sort of review. He felt

03:06.887 --> 03:09.270
part of the faculty there. He felt at home. He did. 
He sure did. Yeah, he said, this is a happy school.

03:12.533 --> 03:14.936
He really over and over again, this is a happy 
place. And that was really, really good. It really

03:16.958 --> 03:17.419
was. How about Jack Williams now? When had you 
first encountered Jack Williams? We were at A&M

03:23.506 --> 03:29.993
when he came in there and announced that he was 
going to be president. So we saw him the first time

03:30.428 --> 03:44.592
that he was a mouse.

03:44.612 --> 03:48.940
I remember that we were in a room and it was awkward. 
I remember that Mary Williams, his daughter, she

03:50.290 --> 03:55.215
was sitting at the headrest. She was really young. 
We were sitting right behind her. She and her

04:05.905 --> 04:09.028
mother. That's when we got pregnant. I assume, if I 
can remember, that I was involved with

04:18.910 --> 04:26.118
some of the program. He'd be able to hang with

04:26.138 --> 04:37.351
them when we had the meetings up there. He liked 
them. Well, Joe has been always a reasonable

04:37.671 --> 04:39.593
person, you know. He's not... He can see the good 
and the bad side of A&M, you know, but some of them

04:39.853 --> 04:44.338
are just blind. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Our policy was that 
we didn't try to Yeah, that's

04:46.535 --> 04:57.458
a hard line.

04:59.141 --> 04:59.903
Good. You

05:00.003 --> 05:04.573
can't change. Yeah. And you have to help him. And 
for him, that's the theory that we hold. And that's

05:13.589 --> 05:15.091
a good theory. I mean, in the business, you see a lot 
of people who try to run the ship, and you really

05:15.111 --> 05:20.038
shouldn't. Jack, you know, when I started at A&M 
Brook, Rudder was president of Brook. And when

05:25.526 --> 05:32.235
Jack came in, I think he was probably a good I think 
Rudder did so much to change the foundation, and

05:33.160 --> 05:49.617
then Jack Williams took advantage of it and made a

05:33.160 --> 05:49.617
major thrust. In the development of the series, 
did either or both of you have any real personal

05:51.993 --> 06:03.231
input in selecting titles or anything like that? 
That was one rule. We made a rule that we would have

06:04.854 --> 06:12.246
nothing to do with any except finals. I say that we 
didn't say that we wouldn't appreciate knowing

06:12.266 --> 06:16.212
the Artists and so forth. I mean, that didn't come 
up, but that's the most, the pleasure we got out of

06:18.582 --> 06:28.451
it, unbeknownst to time. If we were glued in things 
with the authors and the artists, then we enjoyed

06:28.471 --> 06:36.298
it. I think that kind of made the whole series a 
little more special for the artists and for

06:36.318 --> 06:46.367
the universe. Very well. Is there a particular 
title or book that you are most happy

06:46.853 --> 07:02.458
with? And I won't say that you said that, but what 
I'm going to do in the text is go through it. I'm

07:06.886 --> 07:09.570
going to try to pull out a few titles that I really 
want to... Well, you pick out your two, and I'll

07:10.225 --> 07:14.969
pick out mine. Well, of course, if Ashley would 
have liked the Shiva's, who wouldn't like the

07:15.009 --> 07:21.035
Shiva's? Oh, yeah, sure. But after that, I think, 
as far as successful, I'd take us to the Rio

07:21.796 --> 07:28.302
Grande. It's a very good school. It's sold well. I 
think the books that have different artists

07:30.464 --> 07:38.791
outside of the book, because you have different 
artists in the interpretation of that area, you

07:30.464 --> 07:38.791
know, like the Hill Country. That's nice. Frank 
Rayville

07:40.600 --> 08:01.821
is quite unusual, but

07:40.600 --> 08:01.821
we went to the archives at UT and they had so much of 
his work put out there before Frank and I, and you

07:40.600 --> 08:01.821
went with us out there before they did that book. We 
did, as far as the input on anything, we did go look

08:01.841 --> 08:04.204
at that. Like I said, Frank was the publisher, you 
do. The

08:07.786 --> 08:28.446
director,

08:07.786 --> 08:28.446
he knew. Sure. Yeah. He knew. He knew. He knew. He 
knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He

08:35.192 --> 08:35.352
knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He 
knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew.

08:38.212 --> 08:42.075
And the second

08:38.212 --> 08:42.075
would be the . Oh, yeah, that is a pretty thing. That 
is nice. That'd be nice. Yeah. So we agree on

08:47.140 --> 08:49.362
something. OK. And I say, I'm not going to try to put 
you on the . There's a Phoenix painting over there.

08:57.449 --> 09:00.972
And you may have been involved in it. You talked 
about a gathering of the herd. What is that? Tell me

09:04.334 --> 09:05.315
that. I'm going to show you the thing. That was one 
of the nicest deals, and we did it after the book. It

09:14.360 --> 09:17.603
was the Frank Ray Longhorn book. Now, we knew a 
fellow here that was a Longhorn person, and we

09:18.044 --> 09:27.814
decided to have a... He offered...

09:38.219 --> 10:07.433
he for some reason we probably talked to him about 
the book and because he there's what you call a

09:38.219 --> 10:07.433
texas longhorn association yeah yeah 
organization yeah he was involved in that and

09:38.219 --> 10:07.433
we decided to have a party out of this place and We 
were going to charge something for it, and the

10:08.425 --> 10:20.686
money was going to be split between the press and 
the Longhorns Association. I think we spent so

10:20.706 --> 10:24.653
much on the party, we were in the elevator. Let me 
find that picture. I'm going to show you the... How

10:26.336 --> 10:32.627
many people were there? There, how many, what can 
we, this was a, this was a, I'd say, 150. I hadn't

10:40.011 --> 10:41.652
forgotten this. This is the pictures of Frank's 
memorial service to the Frank family. I bet they

10:48.178 --> 10:50.541
don't let the class. That'll make you

10:51.301 --> 11:01.011
cry. Because I haven't seen any of it. Actually,

11:03.370 --> 11:33.124
you

11:03.370 --> 11:33.124
had a mixture of A&M people and ranchers, and there 
were a whole bunch of People drove their trailers

11:34.285 --> 11:36.587
there. They stayed all night. My son had a trailer 
that time. He parked it there early. A trailer, a

11:44.436 --> 11:46.018
mobile bus. A mobile bus, yeah. We stayed all 
night. That was a good party. That's why Lindsay

11:51.844 --> 11:53.826
remembered it, too, so well. The memorial, 
Frank's memorial in... This was A.C. Carter.

11:59.410 --> 12:00.231
That's his wife. This is Lady Bird. She was there. 
Yeah. And who's that? That's Joe Moore, and this

12:04.196 --> 12:09.782
is... That's Skinny James. All right. Is that... 
That's the first... You've already edited during

12:10.703 --> 12:16.731
Wednesday's Luder eclipse. That's your first. 
That's Benny. Okay. Let's see. I think it is. Is it?

12:21.096 --> 12:23.499
I was trying to look at the tag. It must be. Benny, I 
was really in good shape. No, that's not

12:27.813 --> 12:34.704
me. That's my first one. I believe that's you. I 
believe that's you. Y'all are having a good time.

12:50.488 --> 12:51.049
He really was. He could tell a story. And Harry

12:52.737 --> 13:07.793
Lipscomb, I got to know very well.

13:14.067 --> 13:20.173
The one mistake that you've made is not making a 
video of that deal out there. Yeah. I actually

13:21.814 --> 13:27.339
think that he might have had, did he have some 
Mexican dancers? He had a guy out there cooking,

13:27.360 --> 13:33.285
what would you call it, roast? Then he'd do some 
meat about that big around. He cooked it outside.

13:41.493 --> 13:43.855
He cooked it outside. On a spit? Was it over a spit or

13:46.694 --> 13:52.084
just on a pit? I think Frank was very hostile when 
they had Frank Wardler's day in Texas. He invited

13:57.595 --> 14:00.220
Chester Kerr and his wife to stay with us. Oh, 
that's good. He said, well, they want to stay where

14:01.843 --> 14:06.552
we stay. Fortunately, we had two bedrooms extra. 
Did he tell you first or after the fact? Well, he

14:12.188 --> 14:15.732
told us before they got there, but I'm glad he let me 
know. Yeah, that's good.

14:20.599 --> 14:21.400
Those were good days. There was a lot going on and a 
lot of excitement. We were going to drive back that

14:25.405 --> 14:27.929
night. My son was there, so we went over and stayed 
in his deal. And I got up real early. And where they

14:33.956 --> 14:36.640
had that meet... It was still hot. It was cold. 
Yeah. I went over and got, it was, we took Hugh

14:40.570 --> 14:45.377
Larry. And then I asked him for a little, he sliced 
me off, so I was pretty wrecked when I was there. I

14:50.424 --> 14:54.510
think that was earlier than most of the time he did 
that. I guess that John went back one time. If

14:59.256 --> 15:04.163
Bamber was present, and he and Bob Walker came in 
there, he had on cowboy clothes. They really

15:04.750 --> 15:07.133
looked like drugstore cowboys. I bet they did. 
They looked like the real cowboys. I bet they did.

15:12.399 --> 15:13.921
I'll have to talk to Frank, too. Ask him about that 
for me. I'll do that. I'm going to ask him about

15:15.623 --> 15:16.664
that. He and Bob Wilkins were there. Really, they 
didn't look like cowboy clothes. Yeah, they

15:25.194 --> 15:27.096
probably had to work hard at that. I don't think 
I've ever seen Frank try to dress in western

15:27.156 --> 15:32.462
attire.

15:39.513 --> 15:48.002
Do you remember that

15:39.513 --> 15:48.002
either? Yes, we had lunch one day for a gala, and 
someone pressed back. We had James Michigan come,

15:53.729 --> 15:57.393
and Tom was out. Tom told James, he said, remember, 
we worked for the same publisher at the same time.

16:04.501 --> 16:05.362
Whatever time it was, they were publishing. You 
know, that's something, the world of publishing

16:05.382 --> 16:08.305
really changes. I never did that. Where is the 
mystery? Where is me? And I know even, somebody,

16:12.558 --> 16:23.853
Vanderman and I were talking, just in passing, you 
know, we were talking about computers, and what is

16:12.558 --> 16:23.853
this going to do to books? And both of us said 
nothing. We got a call from Vanderman the other

16:25.254 --> 16:34.326
day, a couple days ago, and he said, I want to go 
where I can sit, I want to sit in my new book. and i

16:34.812 --> 17:00.027
said frank we have what it says to betty and joe love 
frank that's good did you know about the incident

16:34.812 --> 17:00.027
of mission no i don't let's do that that's going to 
be a good one tell me about that that's a good one

17:19.835 --> 17:24.922
I remember him in the MSC, and I don't know if that 
was a press occasion. There was some sort of a

17:24.942 --> 17:29.768
reception for Mishma over there. Yeah. I don't 
remember that. I don't remember what that

17:30.529 --> 17:32.691
occasion was either. We got acquainted with Jim 
Mishma, and he was going to move here to Austin to

17:32.711 --> 17:40.982
start his research on Texas. And we had a guest 
house out of the lake. And we offered

17:49.193 --> 17:55.001
it to three someone else. In fact, we didn't meet 
him at the time. We would have gone and he went out to

17:57.104 --> 18:01.129
look at the house. It was too far out of town. And he 
left us a little note about side-to-side,

18:08.047 --> 18:30.502
abandoned the spot,

18:08.047 --> 18:30.502
and lost that place, but anyhow. Then sometime 
later, we flew him out to West Texas, and he was

18:30.522 --> 18:33.807
linking to them, talking about geology and so 
forth, so we actually made a couple trips around

18:30.522 --> 18:33.807
there. We took him to Fady Williams' Bull City, 
with Jack Lindham. I'm sorry they made that

18:37.088 --> 18:46.701
picture over

18:37.088 --> 18:46.701
there. But, uh, Lee, you just called us out of the 
blue.

18:52.329 --> 18:53.430
Oh, Michigan did? Yeah, I wanted to see that. You'd 
like to go in and see that? Is that what

19:00.120 --> 19:05.146
it is? Well, uh, yes, uh, he said that. There's

19:07.362 --> 19:17.452
a

19:07.362 --> 19:17.452
shortage in the book business. Books are, like, 
give your high kids to have reference books. In

19:20.135 --> 19:22.998
England, it has 2 million of those. And he said if 
there's a void, they leave that, and the series, he

19:23.018 --> 19:33.529
said he'd give 100,000 to be matched. He actually 
made that all clear. We went over there, and we

19:34.690 --> 19:36.812
didn't know exactly what he meant. And Dr. Lloyd 
was in Oregon

19:37.383 --> 19:50.835
or someplace, so he was at a meeting in Salt Lake 
City, or Lloyd-Lyman, and I said, Lord, Jim,

19:37.383 --> 19:50.835
what's the issue with October? They said, well, we 
could do it after Christmas. Not Lloyd, but John

19:55.114 --> 19:58.818
King's mystery. Yeah, a system. Well, I said, 
well, you know, we have busy people getting around

20:00.220 --> 20:05.406
Christmas. Let's go right now. We went before 
Thanksgiving. Silverstone at Christmas in

20:08.029 --> 20:11.212
Texas. Yes, yes, yes. I have to talk to Lloyd about 
that, too. I'm glad you mentioned that. Yeah,

20:17.800 --> 20:18.240
absolutely. It came about that he, just out of the 
blue, said he'd put up one house, and somebody

20:18.423 --> 20:27.357
would put up another, but it was 150. I'll find out, 
yeah. And he did not want his man on it. Yeah, and

20:32.284 --> 20:34.828
that was to be used, that's what I'm trying to think 
of. And all I know is, because I remember talking to

20:34.888 --> 20:45.544
Deloy about that, to kind of promote, it wasn't to 
promote books or training or press or something a

20:34.888 --> 20:45.544
little different than usual. You know, he doesn't 
want

20:46.317 --> 21:01.080
his name mentioned on, you know, any building. 
Yeah. He wants his name first, of course.

21:07.250 --> 21:07.550
Is that right? Is he? Where is he now? He's still 
here. He's still here, okay. Anyway, we went to

21:10.815 --> 21:13.219
Japan with Mari and Cheryl and I went to Tokyo. And 
then we met Tim and we took a ship from northern

21:13.351 --> 21:20.201
Japan and brought it to the Aleutians. This is when 
he was researching Alaska. Yeah. And some Navy

21:22.305 --> 21:26.291
plane had flown him to the islands. We were able to 
get all the islands from there on back to Nome.

21:36.346 --> 21:36.566
Okay. We're going to stop here if you're ready.
