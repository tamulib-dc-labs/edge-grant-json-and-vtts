WEBVTT

00:01.516 --> 00:06.885
Oh, my goodness.

00:06.905 --> 00:08.368
Yeah. Let's see. Did your wife begin teaching 
then? She taught the next fall, fall of 1956. She

00:14.919 --> 00:21.411
taught the second grade for seven years and then 
moved up to high school. She was real fortunate.

00:23.214 --> 00:25.718
She had her degree in French and Spanish And, of 
course, taught the second grade. She went to LSU

00:28.528 --> 00:39.843
one semester to take elementary because it looks 
like she was going to teach in Baton Rouge, and she

00:28.528 --> 00:39.843
needed a teacher's certificate in Louisiana. And 
then we came on back, and so fortunately, that's

00:40.484 --> 00:43.829
what happened. All right, back to your teaching. 
Did you feel that the electrical engineering

00:47.153 --> 00:52.600
department have provided the facilities, the 
laboratory equipment that were appropriate when

00:53.086 --> 00:59.793
you got here? For what we were doing then, yeah. You 
had two machinery labs, and on the third floor you

01:05.079 --> 01:13.348
had electronics. The second floor they had that 
IBM 650, which they put in there. They also had a

01:17.690 --> 01:22.555
network analyzer, a network calculator, which 
was furnished by the utilities. And this is how

01:23.056 --> 01:26.960
they run their transmission problems on there. 
And so this was about it. And of course, there's

01:32.626 --> 01:36.851
only one PhD in the whole department then. And that 
was a hallmark. None of the rest of them had PhDs. Ed

01:44.439 --> 01:45.300
Andrews came back from, he had his, Ed Andrew was 
the first one to walk across the strage in G. Wally

01:46.158 --> 01:54.890
White. And he got his Ph.D., and Andrew was the 
first one. I'd like to have gotten a picture of that

01:59.135 --> 02:04.443
last one to go across and let her have a picture of 
him.

02:07.847 --> 02:14.376
Can you help me understand in the 30-some-odd 
years you've taught, how the program changed in

02:15.065 --> 02:21.696
electrical engineering. Well, they're 
unrecognizable now, of course. John Paul German,

02:25.722 --> 02:39.544
of course, he came here to teach field theory and 
this sort of thing, and so the real explosion came

02:25.722 --> 02:39.544
with the integrated circuit, with the transistor 
and this sort of thing. When was that? Of course,

02:42.520 --> 02:47.665
the transistor discrete components were in use by 
then. We didn't run any experiments except with

02:47.745 --> 02:53.010
vacuum tubes by then. And of course, the IBM 650 had 
4,000 memory storage locations. And of course,

02:59.656 --> 03:02.619
that was the only computer on the campus. And then 
of course, they built the data processing center

03:03.420 --> 03:10.587
down where they put in the 709 and this sort of 
thing. But it's just unbelievable the change that

03:12.490 --> 03:17.297
occurred. Who were the people who deserve special 
mention as helping to get those changes

03:17.537 --> 03:28.171
accomplished? Are there some deans or some 
department heads or faculty members? In

03:32.597 --> 03:34.099
electrical engineering? That deserve special 
mention?

03:41.144 --> 03:44.248
Recently or what? Any time during those. Who were 
the people that made the difference? Back in those

03:49.395 --> 03:50.416
days? Well,

03:50.476 --> 04:06.137
of course, they were all good undergraduate 
teachers and some graduate, but people like John,

03:50.476 --> 04:06.137
Walt Mattson, he left. And then Mike Reckoff, he 
just died. He was one of the new ones that had gone

04:11.215 --> 04:14.059
off. A fellow named Ed Andrews, who left later, he 
later died.

04:24.252 --> 04:25.974
It's really, really hard to say. Calhoun comes as 
dean, and then Benson. Oh, yeah. How did they

04:32.703 --> 04:39.231
summarize them, describe their work as deans? Of 
course, I guess Benson was the dean when I went on to

04:39.835 --> 04:47.703
the faculty, and pretty soon after that, John 
Calhoun came.

04:50.846 --> 04:52.027
Well, he was dean, too. I don't know how that works 
in. I think Calhoun was first, and then he moved to

04:53.548 --> 04:57.432
the system level. He moved on up, and then Benson 
became the dean. Of course, I think the greatest

05:01.877 --> 05:08.543
thing about A&M is the strong administration. the 
presidents and the deans and the department

05:08.928 --> 05:16.439
heads, everybody knew where they stood, more or 
less. And of course, I think Rutter was probably

05:16.459 --> 05:20.285
the greatest of all. Why do you think? Because he 
brought us kicking and screaming into the 20th

05:22.428 --> 05:27.516
century. He was able to keep the former students 
happy and the faculty happy and also the students.

05:37.565 --> 05:40.809
to get us up into the 20th. And here, he had just a 
Bachelor of Science. Everybody scared of him.

05:49.101 --> 05:54.128
Like he said, he said, you know, Highway 6 runs in 
both directions. And one of the faculty members,

05:54.709 --> 06:00.096
they came by and resigned.

06:00.430 --> 06:05.515
I tell people over and over, only Earl Rudder could 
have made those basic changes. Then Jack Williams

06:06.375 --> 06:11.800
was a great blessing that he could build on those 
changes. That if you reverse them, they both pay.

06:18.006 --> 06:29.256
Were you aware, as a faculty member, of any 
specific judgments or decisions that President

06:18.006 --> 06:29.256
Rudder made or that Jack Williams made that 
affected engineering?

06:33.864 --> 06:35.527
I don't know. I don't know of any. I don't either. 
How did you and other and your colleagues react to

06:40.013 --> 06:49.186
co-education and non-compulsory core to those 
changes? Well, of course, I think we were all

06:49.607 --> 06:52.631
pretty much in favor of it. I know my own son, he was 
born here, but He had already made up his mind to go

06:58.160 --> 07:06.592
to the University of Texas, even though it became 
voluntary.

07:07.774 --> 07:15.606
And so I was in President Rutter's office one day, 
and Fred was working at the 40 Acres Club. And he

07:16.767 --> 07:20.273
says, I see Fred has gone to the University of 
Texas. Why didn't he go to A&M? Well, I had to

07:22.256 --> 07:27.323
explain it to him, more or less like an excuse. I 
always said, well, I'm glad I had tenure anyway.

07:33.501 --> 07:34.062
Yeah. Did, as you recall your classes, do you 
remember any

07:34.522 --> 07:52.321
kinds of unusual events over a woman being in class 
or a black student being in class? Well, of course,

07:53.342 --> 07:57.647
we co-educated and black at the same time. But we 
had a number of wives of students. And this yell

08:03.286 --> 08:06.690
leader was in this class. And she was in there. And 
he was very nasty about her and all that stuff. She

08:13.277 --> 08:14.799
kind of straightened him out. But this is back. 
Here's a purebred Aggie that just resented it

08:16.761 --> 08:22.508
badly. But in general, I don't know of anything 
particular about it. If we had had a faculty

08:28.677 --> 08:42.573
referendum on, the whole faculty, on 
co-education, non-compulsory core, racial

08:28.677 --> 08:42.573
integration, higher admission requirements, 
what do you think the vote would have been? Back in

08:44.355 --> 08:45.316
those days? Which one would they prefer? No, no, 
no. Would they have voted for any of those, all of

08:49.480 --> 08:52.884
those? I don't know that they would. Let's see. I 
believe that the average faculty member would

08:58.478 --> 09:04.486
have voted for most of those, if not all. And Mr. 
Rutter said to me privately, he said, I didn't need

09:06.069 --> 09:13.639
a faculty referendum because I assumed the 
faculty favored all of those.

09:16.503 --> 09:23.733
Do you remember any racial

09:16.503 --> 09:23.733
events? The only one I remember is a a young black 
fellow who was on active duty and was sent here as an

09:27.689 --> 09:35.162
undergraduate student. And I advised him and so 
forth. And then I discovered he had been

09:39.048 --> 09:44.177
transferred out to New Mexico or someplace. And so 
I asked why he left. And he said, well, he was

09:48.464 --> 09:52.431
married to a white woman. And they just, you know, 
pressure on me. This is the only occurrence I

09:55.699 --> 09:58.363
remember. We really didn't have hardly any blacks 
in there, but the ones we had, I remember, did okay.

10:07.395 --> 10:17.709
Now, as women began to major in engineering, did 
they handle the work academically as well as the

10:07.395 --> 10:17.709
men did? The what? Were their grades as high? The 
women? Oh, I loved them. I think it was much better.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.430
And I think they were very comparable. I can't 
distinguish at all whether they did any worse or

10:29.471 --> 10:35.499
better or this sort of thing. In all of your years as 
a faculty member, can you share any anecdotes

10:36.681 --> 10:50.380
about any pranks or teasings or good bull that 
students ever attempted on you or any other

10:36.681 --> 10:50.380
faculty member? No, I can't really. No students 
played any trick on you? No tricks. What was your

10:57.905 --> 10:58.906
nickname? I didn't have one. I can't remember that 
I did. I never heard of one. They were abandoned, I

11:06.354 --> 11:09.637
think, by the time I started teaching. For one 
thing, the students were so scattered. It wasn't

11:16.344 --> 11:17.886
like when we were eating and living and going to 
class together that we all more or less got

11:18.085 --> 11:23.630
nicknames. So that just has played out. Now, you 
all moved from Bolton Hall to what? To Zachary when

11:31.117 --> 11:32.818
it opened. We've been there ever since it opened. 
What was it like? Describe that change. Well, of

11:38.643 --> 11:46.050
course, I was kind of in charge of working with 
Nash, the architect, and also the equipment we had

11:38.643 --> 11:46.050
and the, the people furnishing equipment and this 
sort of thing. And so I was involved in those

11:49.268 --> 11:52.051
details. And also when the faculty member had some 
kind of a question, they were supposed to come

11:52.171 --> 12:03.764
through me and I would try to get an answer from Nash 
or what else it was. So. Did, was that architect and

12:05.465 --> 12:14.535
his staff, were they sensitive to the suggestions 
that you made? Oh, I think so, yeah. I didn't hear

12:17.871 --> 12:18.771
much. One was worried about getting his equipment 
up to the floor. He didn't think the elevator was

12:23.135 --> 12:24.937
big enough. So I went over and measured it, and it 
had a back door, too. So it worked out all right. He

12:29.581 --> 12:32.844
was really worried about getting his equipment up 
there. Now, let's see. Dan Benson was dean in those

12:33.825 --> 12:36.487
days, right? Oh, yeah. Describe him. Make believe 
that I had never met him. Describe him in

12:40.550 --> 12:43.133
personality and style. Fred Benson? Well, of 
course, I've known him all along while he was dean.

12:51.653 --> 12:58.019
I even went to talk to him about a job, and he 
referred me to the department and so forth. But he

12:58.860 --> 13:01.303
certainly was a strong dean. There was one man that 
he got rid of. The students complained to me about

13:09.967 --> 13:16.773
the fact that he was downgrading the school and all 
that sort of thing. And so I said, well, you've got

13:18.375 --> 13:23.019
to go talk to the dean about him and let him know. And 
what Benson did was give him, supervised his

13:23.259 --> 13:32.788
research and so forth, and found he was really 
liking it. And this is the way he was able to get rid

13:32.808 --> 13:39.754
of him, which is pretty hard to do in a tenured 
faculty. But I thought he ran a tall ship and had

13:40.493 --> 13:45.918
good administrators with him and everything. Did 
he earn the trust of the faculty? Oh, I think very

13:50.341 --> 13:51.843
much so. Mm-hmm. Oh, Page now, he didn't do such a 
good job, I don't think. I'm not sure why. I was not

14:01.291 --> 14:05.134
up in that area where they knew about that. I was 
thinking the other day, there ought to be some

14:09.923 --> 14:14.248
engineering facility on this campus named in 
honor of Fred Benson. He earned that, I think.

14:19.674 --> 14:20.355
Well, let's see. Let's try to kind of draw this near 
an end. What has it meant to you in your life that you

14:28.465 --> 14:34.372
went to Texas A&M as a student? As a student? What 
did your coming here, instead of going somewhere

14:36.754 --> 14:39.778
else, What has been, what is the meaning of it? 
Well, I have no doubt I came to the right place. I

14:47.664 --> 15:09.445
feel like the relationships that I developed with 
my fellow students and the faculty and the more or

14:47.664 --> 15:09.445
less focus that we had on an education and of course 
the athletics is a part of it, but I just feel like

15:10.235 --> 15:27.879
out of 52 in the class of 45 that left here in orders, 
52 of them, all in the Signal Corps, and they said

15:10.235 --> 15:27.879
report to Camp Beauregard at your own expense. And 
they didn't get to finish until after the war. And

15:32.526 --> 15:37.052
after 50 years, I got 27 of them to come back. Some of 
them had not come back after the war, but they came

15:38.332 --> 15:43.438
back anyway. So I think this type of loyalty you 
have, I think the university is unique. And also, I

15:50.927 --> 15:55.753
feel like it has endured pretty well. And I feel 
like they're still Aggies, they still want to come

15:56.614 --> 16:07.427
here, and they have developed the esprit de corps 
that we had not as much, of course, The classes are

16:07.728 --> 16:13.997
too big and too scattered, but it's just a unique 
school. What contributes to that spirit? Well,

16:17.001 --> 16:19.966
they start out with freshman week. Of course, they 
got that summer, and the freshman week is so

16:20.887 --> 16:28.538
important, I think. And, of course, they have so 
many things like the L practice and the student

16:29.041 --> 16:38.872
bodies sitting together and this sort of thing. 
Really, it's interesting that it still persists.

16:42.816 --> 16:56.190
I know I talked to the woman in the Memorial Student 
Center in the bookstore, and she had lived in

16:42.816 --> 16:56.190
Austin, and then she was over here, and she just 
noticed it, how it was so different from over at the

16:42.816 --> 16:56.190
university. I've had a theory that these events 
you mentioned, including Silver Taps and Luster

16:59.450 --> 17:08.483
and Midnight Y'all Practice and all of those, that 
they are inclusive. Male, female, core,

17:09.144 --> 17:15.292
civilian, short, tall, rich, poor, country or 
town. If you're one of us, come on and join. And then

17:18.597 --> 17:29.372
the grand finale is commencement, where every 
name is called, every hand is taken, that it is

17:18.597 --> 17:29.372
inclusive instead of being exclusive. and that 
that really helps. And that causes me to ask, did

17:34.486 --> 17:42.877
you not, when you were a student or since then, were 
you aware of any secret fraternities? Yes. So

17:46.381 --> 17:59.697
secret, the only indication I had of this 
apparently is when they decided to boycott the

17:46.381 --> 17:59.697
Bryan Theaters. Apparently it came from that, but 
it really... Do you know what the names of the

18:00.200 --> 18:05.207
groups were? No, I never knew. It's so 
insignificant, that's the only case I've ever

18:05.888 --> 18:10.915
heard of that. What little I can find, apparently 
the primary purpose of the one or more secret

18:11.536 --> 18:23.794
fraternities was to get their own members in key 
positions student leadership position. Really?

18:26.317 --> 18:33.747
To get one of their own to be the corps commander, 
the head yell leader and so forth. But that was

18:33.767 --> 18:37.272
secret. Let's see.

18:43.541 --> 18:48.027
We've already talked about the key ingredients of 
being an Aggie and so forth. Oh, the Aggie ring. Was

18:49.786 --> 18:54.894
there any kind of ritual in those days of what you 
did when you got it? No, I don't remember any. But,

18:57.579 --> 19:02.046
of course, different outfits would have 
different rituals, I guess. All right. Three

19:04.891 --> 19:06.153
other things to mention. One of them. If you have 
any papers, any stuff you have saved, that you ever

19:14.028 --> 19:20.354
wanted to part with, I beg you, please give it to the 
A&M Archives in the Cushing Library. If this is any

19:21.595 --> 19:33.285
letters, any memorabilia, any notes, any 
photographs that you want to part with, that's the

19:21.595 --> 19:33.285
place where it would be preserved. Okay, next one. 
Let's make believe that somebody walks up to you

19:35.687 --> 19:41.993
and gives you a million dollar check with only one 
requirement. you must give it to texas a m but you

19:42.530 --> 20:11.912
decide what would be done with it if you were to give 
a million dollars to a m what would you want it to be

19:42.530 --> 20:11.912
used for

19:42.530 --> 20:11.912
what good what good part of a m would be most 
important to you

19:42.530 --> 20:11.912
well it has to be the faculty i think i can't i don't 
know it really I thought about it. It's disturbing

20:13.292 --> 20:17.916
about the core. If you notice that graph that was in 
the newspaper this week, well, you see what's

20:18.637 --> 20:24.302
going to happen. I mean, it's really because 
you've only got 400 or 500 in the freshman and

20:25.443 --> 20:37.254
sophomore class, and I don't see how you're going 
to, I feel like the core's kind of archaic. And

20:37.794 --> 20:40.617
almost every one of those freshmen has a 
scholarship. I will add, that's what they've got

20:41.423 --> 20:45.289
to do, of course, to get them. And so many of them are 
dropping out after the first two years now. After

20:50.777 --> 20:51.659
two years? Well, that's okay. I think it's fine 
what they're doing. It's a good image for the

20:58.049 --> 21:08.284
thing, but I'm afraid the people at a distance that 
see the football games think this is what we are.

21:08.324 --> 21:09.887
Oh, yes. Mm-hmm. Okay, last question. What 
feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M

21:12.750 --> 21:17.016
now? Now?

21:22.304 --> 21:25.789
Well, I'm very fond of my whole experience.

21:29.153 --> 21:31.657
Not as much as anything living here. And seeing old 
Aggies coming back when they retire, moving here,

21:31.697 --> 21:39.628
and...

21:42.123 --> 21:46.770
It's just so unique because, of course, my wife 
taught for 32 years. Always students show up of

21:48.172 --> 21:50.155
hers. I don't see hardly any of mine because 
they're all scattered. But I don't know.

22:02.915 --> 22:04.217
What was your question again? What feelings do you 
have for Texas A&M in your heart? Just a great

22:08.718 --> 22:10.904
fondness for it, of course. That's the best thing I 
can say. There's not a single thing about my life

22:12.910 --> 22:18.908
that I would want to do differently. That's what 
I've done.
