00:03.473 --> 00:08.760
You mentioned that you were mayor of Amarillo for a 
period of six years. Could you tell me a little bit

00:10.622 --> 00:12.024
about that? I was first city commissioner for six 
years, and then I was mayor for six years during the

00:12.044 --> 00:22.116
war. And it was during this time that you were also 
in your brick supply business. Oh yeah, that's not

00:28.805 --> 00:30.747
a full-time job. without practicing no 
remuneration. The city managed the form of

00:34.467 --> 00:36.790
government. Of course, it took a lot of time. Well, 
I gather you have a city council and a mayor, and the

00:39.254 --> 00:45.143
city council meets how often? Once a week. Once a 
week then. Were there any particular things which

00:48.928 --> 00:56.440
were accomplished for Amarillo while you were 
mayor? Yes, they moved in there. There was a

01:01.085 --> 01:13.598
mechanic school around here, and the

01:01.085 --> 01:13.598
city had a whole lot to do with that. It had 20, 
30,000

01:13.618 --> 01:19.764
men out there at the air base. Now this mechanic 
school, is that a military? Aviation mechanic

01:23.868 --> 01:25.289
school. This is for the Air Force? At that time, I 
guess, was it still the Army Air Corps at that

01:27.410 --> 01:33.721
point, or had it been a separate branch by then? It 
was a separate branch. So did the city make a

01:35.944 --> 01:39.410
proposal to the government to establish it here? 
Oh, yeah. I made a trip every month to Washington

01:42.015 --> 01:48.285
for six months before we ever got a vote. We were 
working with the Chamber of Commerce. and did you

01:51.912 --> 01:54.615
work with your congressman in Washington too or? 
Oh yeah.

02:03.867 --> 02:10.595
Were there any say any plans made for future 
development of Amarillo or anything like that

02:03.867 --> 02:10.595
while you were serving as mayor? Oh yes, we had a 
portion for a plan And I remember still doing good.

02:24.542 --> 02:35.957
Well, it's certainly, from what I've seen of it, a 
fairly well laid out city and looks to be quite

02:24.542 --> 02:35.957
prosperous. Yes, we had a slump here after they 
closed the base, but it's come back nice and

02:37.419 --> 02:42.706
strong. When was the base closed?

02:49.355 --> 02:54.623
It was reopened in 52 and closed in about 58. That 
was during the Korean War that was reopened.

03:02.293 --> 03:06.459
So you would have had a slump then say after 58 when 
it was closed? Yes, we had a slump there after it was

03:07.701 --> 03:11.446
closed in 47. What's the base being used for now?

03:18.160 --> 03:23.827
There's a school out there, Texas Technical 
School. And then there's some private industries

03:23.847 --> 03:32.558
moved in out there.

03:32.578 --> 03:36.884
Different companies.

03:37.124 --> 03:45.455
Are there any other,

03:37.124 --> 03:45.455
say, accomplishments that you would like to be 
remembered for? No, I don't think so. You don't

03:47.517 --> 03:47.998
think so? The two boys, you ready? Okay.
