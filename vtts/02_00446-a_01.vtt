00:02.410 --> 00:05.175
Test, test, this is a test. Today's date is June 
13th, 1983. This is an interview with General

00:14.029 --> 00:19.178
Cargill at Texas A&M University, 2 p.m. This is a 
test.

00:25.613 --> 00:28.037
Today is June 13, 1983. I'm interviewing General 
Cargill at Texas A&M. This is Terry Anderson.

00:35.589 --> 00:37.232
Let's start off with your early years. You were 
born in Waco. Could you tell us when? Yes, I was born

00:42.981 --> 00:47.368
in 1931 on the 22nd of September. And I was born in 
Hillcrest Hospital in Waco, Texas, which is the

00:47.720 --> 00:53.689
county seat for McLennan County. But I was 
actually, my mother and father were actually

00:54.350 --> 00:58.517
living in a little country town south of Waco. So I 
claim Eddie, E-D-D-Y, Eddie, Texas as my

00:58.998 --> 01:03.044
hometown. And of course, since that was the 
closest hospital, that's why I left Waco as my

01:03.745 --> 01:08.433
place of birth. But I've never lived in Waco. I've 
always lived, my hometown's always been Eddie.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.402
And that's in the very southernmost part of 
McLennan County, which is very near the

01:15.631 --> 01:20.737
geographical center of the state. Could we talk 
about your parents? I'd really like to know about

01:23.320 --> 01:34.013
their occupation, the type of people that they 
were, and maybe a little bit about your mom and your

01:23.320 --> 01:34.013
dad, their background. OK. My father was born at 
Rogers, Texas, which is near Temple. And I'm not

01:39.580 --> 01:45.587
sure what county that's in, but it's just outside 
of Temple, which is in Bell County. I've

01:46.006 --> 01:55.956
forgotten the year he was born, but he was born in 
1896 on August the something. And he was the eldest

01:57.897 --> 02:06.065
of some nine or 10 kids. Of course, in those days, 
people had big families. And they lived on a farm,

02:09.208 --> 02:15.034
and I think one or two of his brothers and maybe one 
of his sisters died in their early childhood of

02:16.010 --> 02:25.244
what we would call today relatively minor things, 
things like pneumonia or something like that. But

02:26.165 --> 02:31.914
in any event, he grew into manhood as a farm boy. In 
addition to the regular farm work, well, that area

02:33.516 --> 02:43.992
of the country was heavily wooded at that time, and 
they did a lot of things like cut and haul wood to the

02:33.516 --> 02:43.992
sawmill for lumber. He was a mule skinner, drove a 
team of four mules. And so they lived in that part of

02:50.944 --> 02:55.208
the country for a while. Then they moved up in the 
northern Texas to a little out from a little

02:55.248 --> 03:02.716
community called May Pearl, Texas. And I'm not 
real sure just where May Pearl is, but it's up all

03:02.756 --> 03:08.542
somewhere south of Dallas, I think. I'm not sure. 
But in any event, at the time they were living

03:09.703 --> 03:14.788
there, he joined the... the National Guard. And 
after he'd been in the National Guard for a while,

03:17.586 --> 03:23.592
he was called active duty during the First World 
War. And I think he, well, their ranks then weren't

03:25.033 --> 03:31.619
exactly the same as our ranks are now. His title was 
Waggoner. They found out that he drove mules, was a

03:33.641 --> 03:40.487
mule skinner when he was a young man. When I say 
young man, I mean 16, 17, 18 years old. And so they

03:45.093 --> 03:56.027
were looking for experienced people that could 
drive a team of mules, so he was a mule skinner, or a

03:45.093 --> 03:56.027
wagoner, was his official military rank. And he 
was in the U.S. Army? He was in the U.S. Army, and

03:57.189 --> 04:01.334
this was during the Second World War. First. 
Excuse me, First World War, right. He never had to

04:05.940 --> 04:07.222
go overseas. He was getting ready to take off for 
the port of embarkation when the armistice was

04:07.743 --> 04:13.210
signed. So he never saw any duty. However, he says 
that from some of the sergeants that he had, he had

04:16.637 --> 04:23.604
preferred duty over some of the superiors he 
served under. Did he leave Texas? No. Or was he

04:26.126 --> 04:26.727
trained? He was trained here in Texas at Camp 
Bullis, which I believe is in San Antonio. I'm not

04:32.753 --> 04:34.295
sure what camp. It's still an existing facility of 
some type. But in any event, he was discharged from

04:38.799 --> 04:41.762
there. Then he moved to the little town where I was 
born, Eddy, and went into the wholesale oil

04:42.603 --> 04:51.094
business. He was a Sinclair Oil distributor, 
which was a, I don't know if you remember the old

04:51.434 --> 04:56.821
Sinclair Oil Company. And I think later on it 
changed to ARCO. I think that Atlantic Richfield

05:01.948 --> 05:07.235
is a surviving company from the old Sinclair 
Company. Their symbol was the dinosaur. Well, he

05:09.502 --> 05:31.454
had a wholesale oil distributing company in the 
late 20s,

05:09.502 --> 05:31.454
and apparently was doing quite well with it and 
selling primarily to farmers in the McLennan

05:09.502 --> 05:31.454
County, Bell County region. And then, of course, 
in 1929, the Depression hit. And people were not

05:36.535 --> 05:43.985
able to pay their bills and to make a long story 
short, he had to shut down his business with lots of

05:36.535 --> 05:43.985
accounts receivables on the books. And this was 
probably in about 1930, thereabouts.

05:53.918 --> 05:56.922
And of course, I was born in 31 to complicate the 
situation. He had been married, I guess, mother

05:57.042 --> 06:03.030
and dad had been married almost two years when I was 
born. And so... At that time, he was very active in

06:07.079 --> 06:10.504
the Democratic Party. And in keeping with the 
patronage system that was in effect at that time,

06:11.365 --> 06:23.963
and to maybe some extent still is, he was named the 
postmaster for the little town of Eddy. What a

06:24.303 --> 06:25.365
stroke of luck. Was just one of the few cash-paying 
positions in that whole part of the country. And so

06:30.872 --> 06:36.360
he was the postmaster there throughout my 
childhood and up until I was a teenager. And then

06:37.825 --> 06:49.720
about 1946, which would have made me about 14 or 15 
years old, then he transferred to the rural mail

06:37.825 --> 06:49.720
route and was a rural mail carrier. On the surface, 
you'd think, well, that's a step down from the

06:51.222 --> 06:55.046
postmaster. But the rural mail carrier's job paid 
more money. And plus, he'd get through about 1.30,

06:58.210 --> 07:00.713
2 o'clock in the afternoon. So he'd have some time 
off in the afternoon. And he went ahead and retired

07:02.375 --> 07:07.782
as a rural mail carrier. So he has a federal pension 
now. Right. Both my mother and father still live in

07:12.938 --> 07:14.620
Eddy. And so he retired a few years back. I've 
forgotten exactly when. But he was in the mail

07:21.608 --> 07:36.606
service for, well, from around 1930 until, oh, I 
would say 1975, something like that. So he had a

07:36.646 --> 07:37.988
long time. in the federal service. What impact, 
besides economically, did the Depression have a

07:41.461 --> 07:51.320
psychological impact on him in any sense? I mean, 
to have a business like that and then to lose it? I

07:55.047 --> 08:00.617
think it affected my mother. Probably more than my 
father. Of course, I'm just surely speculating

08:03.894 --> 08:10.284
because being an infant at the time, I really 
wasn't in a position to observe. But dad's always

08:11.146 --> 08:21.983
been kind of an easy come, easy go kind of a guy that 
was very adaptable and just was a very happy type

08:11.146 --> 08:21.983
person no matter what came. I do feel that, of 
course, a small town is a rough place for a young

08:29.318 --> 08:33.444
couple to grow up in, because there's nothing to 
do. And I would think probably that it had an impact

08:33.464 --> 08:41.476
on my mother more than my father, although I 
wouldn't. I just wouldn't know. Disappointment,

08:44.541 --> 08:45.642
probably. Feeling that, why me? No, that kind of 
deal. However, in a town, in a small country town,

08:58.175 --> 09:03.480
in our town especially, one of the chief social 
activities was the church. And our town was split

09:04.701 --> 09:09.906
between the Southern Baptist and the Methodist. 
And there were a few others, but those were the two

09:10.747 --> 09:15.512
predominant churches there. And so I would think 
that in a small community like that, everybody

09:16.333 --> 09:26.282
knows everybody else, knows all their kids, all 
their family histories. It's just like one big

09:26.363 --> 09:27.844
family. Well, the depression hit everybody about 
the same. You know, everybody was just flat broke

09:32.604 --> 09:41.532
and, you know, I mean, literally helping each 
other by giving them food so they wouldn't starve,

09:32.604 --> 09:41.532
those kinds of things. Now, of course, I didn't 
experience it myself, but I've heard about it so

09:41.552 --> 09:45.656
much that I feel like I've lived it. And when I say I 
didn't experience it myself, I didn't experience

09:45.696 --> 09:52.242
those early days, you know, where really the crash 
hit. And, of course, as I say, we fared much better

09:54.143 --> 09:56.886
than most due to my due to the fact that my dad had the 
federal job, which was a rarity. Because there was

10:02.973 --> 10:04.635
just one. And there were a couple of clerks 
involved. But for a reasonably good paying job,

10:08.239 --> 10:12.945
that was the only one in that part of the country. So 
we fared much better than most. But my point is that

10:16.029 --> 10:25.962
even though we were relatively poor, I never knew 
we were poor because everybody else was in the same

10:16.029 --> 10:25.962
boat. I didn't have to envy the Joneses because 
there were no Joneses. Everybody was in the same

10:31.323 --> 10:32.586
boat. Does that make any sense what I'm trying to 
say? Yeah, absolutely. Uniformity. Yeah. And so

10:37.837 --> 10:39.881
that's not a bad word. We were all uniformly

10:39.901 --> 10:44.130
poor. And I've noticed that from many men who went 
to A&M during the 1930s and who had many of the

10:47.862 --> 10:52.588
similar experiences. I've heard a lot of this type 
of a statement before. Being that everybody's in

10:57.914 --> 11:02.480
the same boat, you all feel sort of equal. Yeah, 
that's right. There's sort of an egalitarian of

11:03.361 --> 11:05.343
poverty. Sure. Now, I might tell you a little bit 
about my mother, which would tie in with this. I

11:09.288 --> 11:09.929
want you to. OK. My mother was born Maudie Caroline 
Cole. In fact, I don't believe I told you my

11:15.528 --> 11:18.271
father's full name. C-O-L-E. My father's full 
name is Willie Newton Cargill. And Maudie

11:23.398 --> 11:25.601
Caroline. N-E-W-T-O-N. N-E-W-T-O-N. Right. 
Willie Newton. And my mother was born, you know,

11:30.267 --> 11:37.857
shame to tell you, but I'm not sure where she was 
born. I think Paris, Texas. And... She was from a

11:42.959 --> 11:49.285
family that had come out of Arkansas, and I'm not 
sure where before that. But they, too, were a farm

11:50.186 --> 11:58.294
family, big family,

11:50.186 --> 11:58.294
three or four girls and two or three boys.

12:01.338 --> 12:02.379
Most of them are dead now. My mother has two living 
old maid sisters and one living brother, and the

12:02.439 --> 12:11.768
rest of the family is deceased. They were farmers. 
And I know that they came from Arkansas and lived in

12:15.258 --> 12:21.726
Oklahoma for a while. And I don't know if they came 
to Paris. Well, they must have, because my mother

12:24.810 --> 12:26.853
lived in Oklahoma. So they probably came from 
Arkansas to Paris, Texas, where my mother was

12:26.873 --> 12:31.699
born. And then they moved to Oklahoma. And my 
mother spent some of her childhood there, lived in

12:34.482 --> 12:42.092
a log cabin type of a house with an upstairs area.

12:43.591 --> 12:49.839
Then they moved to Texas, up near Eddy. And that's 
where my father met her, I guess. But in any event,

12:53.723 --> 12:56.146
she went through high school. And then she went in 
the nurse's training. Two of her sisters, the two

13:00.111 --> 13:05.077
sisters that are still living are both retired 
registered nurses. And she went in the nurse's

13:05.978 --> 13:11.725
training at San Antonio, at the Texas State 
Hospital there. And apparently back in those

13:12.346 --> 13:22.060
days, a lot of people performed the nurse's 
training at the Texas State Hospital, which is a

13:12.346 --> 13:22.060
mental institution, of course, at the present 
time, and I presume was at that time. But she didn't

13:23.823 --> 13:25.966
finish her nurse's training. She got married to 
dad before she finished her nurse's training.

13:29.672 --> 13:37.102
Before she, okay, now some of this is going to kind 
of, I'm going to have to go back and catch up as I

13:29.672 --> 13:37.102
remember things. Before mother went into nurse's 
training, she was a school teacher. Now, back in

13:41.236 --> 13:44.519
those days, you didn't have to have a college 
degree, which you never got. She had two years of

13:44.759 --> 13:49.584
college at Mary Harden Baylor University at 
Belton, Texas, in Bell County. But after she got

13:50.685 --> 14:06.820
out of school, after she finished two years of 
school at Mary Harden Baylor, then she was a

13:50.685 --> 14:06.820
schoolteacher at a little country town out west of 
Uvalde called Regan Wells, Texas. Just a little

14:07.501 --> 14:09.623
bitty place, but it's still there. A lot of people 
down in that part of the country knows where Regan

14:10.261 --> 14:13.346
Wells is. So she taught school at Regan Wells for a 
while. And then she went in the nurse's training.

14:21.119 --> 14:23.623
And then she met dad and married and dropped out of 
nurse's training. And then she was a housewife. In

14:26.107 --> 14:28.050
those days, there was some. I hesitate to use the 
word stigma because that's not the word I'm

14:29.600 --> 14:48.282
looking for, but there was some hesitancy for 
women to work, especially some of the old-time

14:29.600 --> 14:48.282
guys, like my dad, for example, felt that if the 
wife worked, then that was a sign that he couldn't

14:29.600 --> 14:48.282
adequately provide for herself. It was an ego 
thing. Thank goodness that's behind us because my

14:50.444 --> 14:53.868
wife works, and I don't know what I'd do without it. 
But in any event, she was a housewife, and... So

14:59.013 --> 15:01.616
they were married probably in the early 20s? They 
were married,

15:01.756 --> 15:06.963
yeah. When he owned the company, mid-20s 
probably?

15:14.692 --> 15:21.080
He was in the oil business, I would say, from about 
1925 until about 1930, somewhere along in there.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.802
Of course, the crash was in 1929. I would say that he 
and mother married, I was born in 1931, and they had

15:23.803 --> 15:28.969
been married about, 18 months. So counting back 
from September of 31, back 18 months would have

15:31.712 --> 15:37.059
made it about 1929. So they married probably just 
months before the crash hit. And of course, at that

15:42.746 --> 15:49.074
time, Daddy had bought a house.

15:49.755 --> 15:52.479
And Dad had been married previously. He was 
married to, I don't even remember the lady's name.

15:55.683 --> 15:58.146
But he was married for a short time, and they 
divorced. and my mother had only been married one

15:58.835 --> 16:00.777
time. But in any event, he had a nice house, one of 
the nicer homes in town. It's still there,

16:06.423 --> 16:10.988
incidentally, where I spent my early childhood. 
And, of course, after Daddy went in the post

16:13.050 --> 16:24.502
office, which was just only a couple blocks down 
the street, I can remember he'd come home at

16:13.050 --> 16:24.502
lunchtime, and we'd have lunch together and take a 
little nap on the floor in the hallway. That was

16:24.582 --> 16:26.464
before the days of air conditioning. So we'd put a 
pallet down on the in the hallway and open all the

16:28.906 --> 16:34.433
doors, and then there would be a draft through 
there to keep you cool. But in any event, the mother

16:34.453 --> 16:41.442
was a housewife up until the beginning of the 
Second World War. And then she went to work for Blue

16:42.483 --> 16:55.599
Bonnet Ordnance Plant, which is in Belton, excuse 
me, which is in McGregor, Texas, working in an

16:42.483 --> 16:55.599
ordinance plant, making bombs.

16:55.619 --> 16:58.643
I think mother worked there about two and a half, 
maybe three years. during the war as a patriotic

16:59.045 --> 17:13.546
effort, but also to help with family finances 
because, of course, I never remember a time when we

16:59.045 --> 17:13.546
had all the money we needed, just like most 
families. So I thought that was an interesting

17:13.566 --> 17:22.179
thing, that Mother was involved with the 
ordinance work. I've forgotten what size bombs

17:22.199 --> 17:28.748
they made, but they were conventional weapons, 
obviously, at that time. just the regular bombs.

17:32.967 --> 17:36.431
And then right after the war, or right before the 
end of the war, she came back home? Yes. Yeah, they

17:37.532 --> 17:44.779
closed down the plant after the war, and then she 
came back home, and then she's never worked since

17:37.532 --> 17:44.779
then. I recall that she might have done some 
part-time sales work at Christmas time at one of

17:45.720 --> 17:51.306
the stores in Waco. Eddie's only about 18 miles 
south of Waco, right on the interstate,

17:51.827 --> 17:55.651
Interstate 35. Used to be, well, it still is, 
Highway 81, US 81. Sure. But now it's Interstate

17:59.305 --> 18:00.387
35. It goes north and south. But with the exception 
of some part-time work at some of the department

18:02.890 --> 18:10.902
stores, like at Christmastime or rush times, she 
never did work. Can you tell me about your dad's

18:11.182 --> 18:12.925
education? Yes. Dad had very little education. As 
I recall, he only went through about the fifth or

18:16.229 --> 18:19.815
sixth grade. And he's

18:21.137 --> 18:28.367
an extremely well-educated man. But he did it by 
reading and studying, a lot of self-study, but

18:28.533 --> 18:34.501
formal education. As I recall, he only went 
through about the fifth and sixth grade. Being the

18:37.406 --> 18:44.015
eldest in a large family, well, he dropped out of 
school at an early age to help on the family farm.

18:47.159 --> 18:53.408
He, throughout his adult life, was very, very 
active in the Masonic Lodge. And it's been kind of

18:54.330 --> 18:58.135
tradition in our family to, you know, became a 
Mason. That was kind of like becoming a Southern

18:59.333 --> 19:01.316
Baptist. It was just expected and something you 
look forward to. I'm an active Mason. Through his

19:08.304 --> 19:14.973
Masonic work, he's done a lot of reading, a lot of 
public speaking. When he was the postmaster, the

19:15.734 --> 19:26.367
postmaster in these little country towns back in 
the 30s was really kind of the center of political

19:15.734 --> 19:26.367
influence. When all the politicians would come 
through, Dad would be the first person they'd go

19:27.190 --> 19:34.037
see because he could influence a lot of votes and so 
forth. Now, when Jim Farley was the postmaster

19:34.057 --> 19:37.581
general, Jim Farley used to come through town. 
He'd always stop and see Dad. And Dad was an

19:40.063 --> 19:46.410
excellent public speaker, taught Sunday school 
class for years. And through his speaking in

19:47.551 --> 19:54.598
connection with Masonic Lodge, he would just use 
his flawless English and just I consider a very

19:55.439 --> 20:01.286
well-educated man, even though he only had a very 
limited formal education. How would you say he was

20:01.967 --> 20:04.189
a Democrat? In what sense was he a Democrat? I mean, 
there's so many different types in America. Was he

20:10.197 --> 20:12.900
a Lyndon Johnson man? Was he a FDR Democrat? He was 
basically an FDR Democrat. Of course, keep in mind

20:23.857 --> 20:24.979
The time and place. I would say if I had to put a label 
on him now, looking back, I would say he's a

20:25.600 --> 20:31.651
conservative Democrat. Although in those days, 
the liberal and conservative labels hadn't

20:31.671 --> 20:36.479
really been developed yet. You were either 
Republican or Democrat. And when I was raised to

20:38.487 --> 20:45.697
believe that Republican was almost like some kind 
of social disease, we had one or two Republicans in

20:38.487 --> 20:45.697
town. And when they'd go down the street, 
everybody's like, hey, there goes that

20:45.878 --> 20:49.022
Republican. I thought the guy had something wrong 
with him for a long time before I realized that this

20:49.262 --> 20:55.211
was a political party. And it's really odd, but 
people just really, if you were a Republican, you

20:55.231 --> 21:04.144
were an outcast in that part of the country. So 
basically, the vast majority of people were

21:04.705 --> 21:08.410
Democrats. And then, of course, you got into your 
primaries is where the real infighting. Because

21:13.788 --> 21:22.357
until this good day, in many parts of Texas, as you 
probably know, being nominated by the Democratic

21:13.788 --> 21:22.357
Party is tantamount to election. And that's 
probably true still at that little voting box. I

21:26.962 --> 21:30.486
doubt if it's going Republican ever. And it may not 
ever go Republican, although I personally vote

21:31.607 --> 21:36.372
for the for the candidate as opposed to a party. I'm 
a registered Democrat, but that doesn't mean that

21:38.850 --> 21:44.835
I always vote a straight ticket by any means. But in 
any event, he's... So you would consider him a

21:47.137 --> 21:50.921
conservative, basically? I would consider him 
basically a conservative. And then what impact

21:53.463 --> 22:00.069
did his political beliefs have on you?

22:00.089 --> 22:06.595
I would think that due to the austere conditions 
that we were living in financially, that I became a

22:07.047 --> 22:10.852
very conservative from a fiscal standpoint. Due 
to a lot of human suffering that went on around me, I

22:10.872 --> 22:17.921
became somewhat liberal as far as people are 
concerned. Now, the two are not always

22:18.722 --> 22:20.965
compatible. And so I would consider myself 
growing out of the conservative fiscal

22:22.087 --> 22:35.164
environment and the liberalism from human 
suffering that was around me, that I would almost

22:36.123 --> 22:41.852
label myself as, well, I would have to label myself 
as a conservative Democrat.

22:45.357 --> 22:49.984
Liberal on people programs, but only to the extent 
that you can afford them. And in other words,

22:51.387 --> 22:58.858
I'm getting in deep water here now. Let me see if I 
can express myself so that it comes through the way

22:59.239 --> 23:02.704
I want it to. I feel very strongly that everyone 
should be able to, that no one should starve, that

23:05.114 --> 23:14.347
no one should not have clothing, that no one should 
be without shelter. But I don't go much past that as

23:16.290 --> 23:21.037
far as the welfare programs. Now, how you draw the 
line between getting the freeloaders off and

23:22.459 --> 23:29.569
helping people that legitimately need help It's a 
fine line, and it almost has to be something that is

23:29.718 --> 23:35.724
a judgment call on somebody's part.

23:39.008 --> 23:45.635
But, you know, I would do anything to keep anyone 
from being hungry because I've seen people hungry

23:39.008 --> 23:45.635
before.

23:49.579 --> 23:55.365
So political ideology for you is much more complex 
than just saying you're a liberal or you're a

23:49.579 --> 23:55.365
conservative. It is. Labels get you in trouble. 
Well, they sure do. Labels get you in trouble.

23:58.629 --> 23:58.729
Yeah. But I

24:00.650 --> 24:08.498
would say that fiscally, I'm a very staunch 
conservative. I just don't believe in spending

24:08.539 --> 24:10.541
money you don't have. It's because sooner or 
later, payday's coming. And it's so much better to

24:15.226 --> 24:24.456
don't bite off more than you can chew and go ahead 
and behave yourself responsibly than it is to try

24:15.226 --> 24:24.456
to get well after you really get sick. I think 
that's the trouble that this country's been in. I

24:26.598 --> 24:28.480
think that we've gone through a real rough 
recession, but I think it's something that we had

24:29.101 --> 24:35.027
to do to get over some of the problems we had. And so I 
feel real good about our economy and our country

24:36.508 --> 24:43.375
right now, better than I have for a long time. 
That's not to say we're well, a long way from being

24:43.695 --> 24:46.518
well. Well, even with these deficits, that must 
bother you. Oh, it does, very much, very much. I

24:56.568 --> 24:58.770
don't know how closely you follow the advocacy of 
Phil Graham, but I'm a real Phil Graham guy. I think

25:06.309 --> 25:13.255
Phil's got it pretty well lined up right, and I 
think a lot of people have. I'm very strongly for a

25:13.335 --> 25:18.720
constitutional amendment that would prohibit 
deficit budgets. It's worked well for us here in

25:18.740 --> 25:20.502
Texas. You may or may not know we've got that here. 
We've had it for years. As a result, we're one of the

25:23.985 --> 25:28.369
strongest states in the union as far as from a 
fiscal responsibility standpoint. And I'm

25:28.653 --> 25:34.079
convinced that we don't have deficits for one 
reason and one reason only, and that is the

25:28.653 --> 25:34.079
Constitution won't permit it. If our politicians 
had the authority, they'd spin us blind just the

25:35.160 --> 25:39.685
way they're doing in Washington. So that's why I'm 
so strongly for a constitutional amendment to

25:39.705 --> 25:47.453
prevent deficit budgets at the federal level. Of 
course, Phil's working very hard for that, and I

25:48.073 --> 25:51.497
hope he's successful. I'll do what I can to help 
him. Tell me about your mother's political

25:52.953 --> 25:55.476
ideology. Was she very involved, or did she get 
involved, or did she leave it to the men? I don't

26:01.063 --> 26:07.872
recall mothers being involved too much in state or 
federal politics. Now, she's always had a strong

26:07.932 --> 26:12.918
interest in local politics. By that, I'm talking 
about maybe like members of the school board.

26:16.002 --> 26:16.282
Sure. Since it was an unincorporated city, we 
didn't have a city council or anything like that.

26:21.128 --> 26:22.470
We do now, but not at that time. As I recall, Mother 
ran for the school board one time because she was

26:23.378 --> 26:29.924
upset about something. Mother is a crusader type. 
If she doesn't like something, she doesn't just

26:33.068 --> 26:36.271
ignore it and go on her way. She tries to go fix it. 
And as a result, she ran for the school board one

26:38.913 --> 26:42.957
time. She was defeated, but at least she got it out 
of her system that she made the effort. But I don't

26:48.082 --> 26:52.947
recall Mother ever being

26:53.872 --> 27:04.882
too keen on state or national politics other than 
the fact that she had an interest in it because of

26:53.872 --> 27:04.882
dad's position in town or what have you. Who is the 
authority in the household?

27:11.508 --> 27:15.472
I would say that's a hard question to answer. I 
would say it's

27:16.633 --> 27:23.659
more or less a sharing type of an arrangement. 
Mother and Dad always talked about things

27:24.213 --> 27:26.095
together. Dad was very prone to let Mother do what 
she wanted to do up to a point. But he had the ability

27:35.006 --> 27:39.571
to put his foot down and say, we're not going to do 
that. And then she knew to pull in because Dad had

27:40.052 --> 27:43.275
finally made a decision. But he was the kind of guy 
that really didn't matter too much. He was

27:48.622 --> 27:51.385
perfectly willing to do pretty well what Mother 
wanted to do. And for example, in discipline,

27:52.613 --> 27:59.122
mother nearly always was a disciplinarian in the 
family with me. And I was the only child for a long

27:59.162 --> 28:00.764
time. I was 15, 16 years old before my second 
brother came along. I'll tell you about that in a

28:03.789 --> 28:05.591
minute. But if there was any spanking or whipping, 
mother nearly always did it. But if I really need

28:10.678 --> 28:16.526
punishing bad, then dad laid the belt on me. And I 
don't think he ever whipped me over two or three

28:17.668 --> 28:19.971
times. But I remember those two or three times 
pretty well. And of course, Mother was the

28:23.739 --> 28:30.391
disciplinarian and more spankings and 
switchings than anything else. And I didn't get

28:31.372 --> 28:33.677
them unless I really needed them. But I was a 
mischievous kid, the way most kids are. But I think

28:37.564 --> 28:40.309
pretty well disciplined. At least everyone says 
that I was. Well, you mentioned before that there

28:41.804 --> 28:45.450
were two types in your town. There were either 
Southern Baptists or there were Methodists. What

28:49.436 --> 28:54.864
was your family and what role did religion have in 
your upbringing? We were Southern Baptists and

28:54.884 --> 28:57.328
are to this day. My wife was from a similar type 
background from a religious standpoint,

28:59.110 --> 29:07.844
Southern Baptist, so we married in the Southern 
Baptist Church, still members of the First

28:59.110 --> 29:07.844
Baptist Church here in Bryan. The church... 
played a very major role in my early childhood and

29:11.943 --> 29:17.171
all through my life and still does.

29:21.258 --> 29:24.623
I don't know how much you know about Southern 
Baptists, but it's a fundamentalist type

29:21.258 --> 29:24.623
religion. And I believe the Bible pretty well 
literally. Of course, there's a lot of people in

29:31.874 --> 29:36.421
the denomination that are breaking away from that 
to some extent. There's always argumentation.

29:37.743 --> 29:38.585
Yeah, always argument. Was the world really 
created? Six days and on the seventh day will God

29:40.546 --> 29:43.349
rest. My concept of God has changed over a period of 
time. But back in those days, it was very dogmatic.

29:50.176 --> 29:52.659
There was no room for latitude. It was A, B, C, black 
and white. And I don't guess the church ever opened

29:56.563 --> 30:00.687
that I wasn't there on the front row. I was a song 
leader in the church when I was a younger man. I

30:07.515 --> 30:09.777
played then and still do the piano. And 
occasionally I would play a special number in

30:10.550 --> 30:20.741
front of the church or play the hymns while the 
church had the song service. I was very active as a

30:22.743 --> 30:36.979
Sunday school teacher and in what we call the 
training union, which was the Sunday night time

30:22.743 --> 30:36.979
activity.

30:38.258 --> 30:44.646
Those early religious teachings, up until the 
time I left to come to college, that was just a

30:38.258 --> 30:44.646
given. There was never any question about are we 
going to church Sunday or are we not. We were always

30:47.930 --> 30:48.851
there.

30:51.894 --> 30:53.316
Were your parents active also? Yes. Dad was always 
a Sunday school teacher. Mother was always there.

30:57.181 --> 31:00.445
I don't recall if she ever taught any classes or 
not. I'm not real sure whether she did or not. She

31:02.387 --> 31:07.253
was not the type that liked to get in front of a group 
and talk too much. But dad was. He was kind of the ham

31:08.449 --> 31:10.551
of the family, still is. Loves to get up in front of a 
group of people and talk, and will at the drop of a

31:10.631 --> 31:14.094
hat. And he's 87 now. But in any event, to answer 
your question, the church had a very profound

31:17.117 --> 31:32.152
impact on my life, developed a lot of my 
philosophies about how you deal with people, your

31:17.117 --> 31:32.152
respect for individuals, respect for life, 
respect for property. Most of my moral teachings

31:33.614 --> 31:37.678
were, of course, The home was just an extension of 
the things I learned in church. And so it's

31:41.812 --> 31:46.985
difficult for me to say that I learned it in church 
or I learned it at home because they all melded

31:41.812 --> 31:46.985
together. But to

31:48.269 --> 31:55.448
answer your question, the church, yes, had a very 
strong impact on my life. childhood, youth, and

31:56.423 --> 31:59.387
all my whole life, and thus today. OK. Now, if I 
asked you to characterize, I mean to say what type

31:59.407 --> 32:10.762
of characters your parents were, could you give me 
sort of a rundown? I mean, you've talked around

32:10.782 --> 32:15.269
this now for a while. I would say that

32:16.030 --> 32:25.182
my father was a very strong but quiet person. that 
avoided controversy when possible, but if he got

32:26.343 --> 32:37.275
in a position where he had to take a stand, he'd 
always take it, and a strong one. Whereas Mother,

32:37.295 --> 32:42.581
on the other hand, was argumentative to some 
extent. I'm using past tense like they're gone.

32:45.624 --> 32:47.206
They both still fit this category.

32:49.749 --> 32:54.814
Mother would argue for the sake of argument, and at 
the drop of a hat would disagree with anyone. And by

32:55.874 --> 33:02.000
the same token, she didn't carry that too far. She 
saw that a rift or a problem was developing with one

33:02.040 --> 33:08.206
of her neighbors or one of her kinfolks. Well, then 
she knew when to pull in her horns. She was the more

33:11.690 --> 33:16.655
aggressive of the two as far as being an outspoken 
domineering. If you logged conversation, dad

33:17.956 --> 33:24.683
would probably talk 20% of the time and mother 80% 
of the time. if that makes any sense.

33:30.389 --> 33:33.854
But very loving, affectionate couple. I would say 
that as the years went by and my two other brothers

33:33.874 --> 33:46.675
came along, and I mentioned that we got an 
interesting situation there I'll tell you about.

33:48.958 --> 33:52.003
Because of the influence of the kids and the 
parents the requirement of time on mother's part,

33:53.300 --> 34:05.033
I think that probably mother and dad grew further 
apart as a result of having the three boys than they

33:53.300 --> 34:05.033
were, as I recall them, in my early childhood. In 
other words, it was an outward show of affection

34:05.834 --> 34:13.543
frequently when I was a younger kid. But I don't 
recall too much of that in the later years,

34:13.563 --> 34:20.611
although they hugged and kissed. Two more young 
children. Yeah. Right. And of course, I'm sure

34:23.050 --> 34:28.976
it's just because of the time involved in raising a 
child. But in any event, when I was about 15 or 16,

34:29.837 --> 34:36.844
mother and daddy were still relatively young at 
that time. And the doctor had told mother that she

34:37.585 --> 34:44.132
couldn't have any more children because of some 
physical problems she had. So they had an

34:45.073 --> 34:49.277
opportunity to adopt my middle-sized brother. 
and got him when I think he was six weeks old. And his

34:52.859 --> 34:55.683
name is Stephen Lee Cargill. And we had him, I 
guess, probably about a year and a half, maybe two

34:56.924 --> 35:02.672
years. And then lo and behold, my mother became 
pregnant with my younger brother. And I

35:07.598 --> 35:11.042
understand afterwards that that happens 
occasionally. I don't know how frequently it

35:11.863 --> 35:14.687
happens, but it does happen. But the conditions, 
her physical conditions, whatever prevented her

35:14.707 --> 35:19.433
from conceiving, cleared up and so quite 
unexpectedly she became pregnant with my younger

35:19.683 --> 35:46.298
brother so I have two brothers middle-sized 
adopted brother and then my younger brother who's

35:19.683 --> 35:46.298
the natural brother and what do they do my 
middle-sized brother graduated from from the

35:19.683 --> 35:46.298
school we have a there are two little towns they're 
Bruceville which is just two miles north of Eddy

35:19.683 --> 35:46.298
and they have a consolidated school district 
which is between the two towns Bruceville Eddy And

35:46.919 --> 35:49.022
he graduated from Bruceville High School. Excuse 
me, what am I saying? Bruceville Eddy High School.

35:54.148 --> 35:59.354
And then he went to Southwest Texas State 
University for about a year and a half, two years.

36:00.255 --> 36:09.827
And then he dropped out of college and went to work 
for KCEN TV station in Temple, Texas, which covers

36:00.255 --> 36:09.827
this broadcast area, Channel 6. And he still works 
for them. Oh, really? What does he do? He was a

36:13.091 --> 36:15.694
production coordinator. working on 
commercials, you know, the actual production and

36:15.877 --> 36:22.546
running cameras and just utility type work for 
several years. Then he had an opportunity to go

36:23.247 --> 36:27.933
into marketing, selling commercials and so 
forth. So he's been a marketing man for KCEN now

36:27.953 --> 36:34.041
for, I guess, at least five years. And he calls on 
the Temple Belton area and enjoys it and probably

36:34.802 --> 36:41.912
go ahead and make a career out of the TV business. My 
younger brother He graduated from Bruce Liddy and

36:44.952 --> 36:54.221
went to school at North Texas University. Let me 
see.

36:58.765 --> 36:59.566
Yes, okay. He graduated from North Texas State 
University in accounting. In the 60s sometime.

37:08.555 --> 37:08.875
Yes. I'd be hesitant to guess what year, but in the 
60s. And then he got out of school and went to work

37:13.420 --> 37:20.868
for Lone Star Steel Company in Dallas. They had a 
plant at Dangerfield, Texas. And he worked in the

37:23.951 --> 37:30.238
home office and their accounting office and then 
their insurance benefits program, what have you.

37:30.258 --> 37:34.943
And then he left them and went back to school and got 
a master's degree in accounting. Then he got out

37:36.905 --> 37:37.866
and did. And then after that, he got his CPA. So then 
he got out and did some private CPA practice. And

37:47.141 --> 37:53.409
also, I'm not real sure just what he did, but it was a 
relatively short period of time. And then he was

37:54.510 --> 37:59.496
married at some time. In the meantime, he's since 
divorced, has one child. Jason is about, oh, I

38:04.783 --> 38:10.550
would say 11, 12 years old now. They just divorced a 
couple years ago, a year and a half. But in any

38:12.905 --> 38:24.839
event, then he went back to the University of 
Missouri and has completed coursework on his PhD

38:12.905 --> 38:24.839
in accounting. And he's now teaching school at 
East Texas State University while he's writing

38:25.961 --> 38:31.107
his dissertation. And he should finish his 
dissertation by December. Hopefully the degree

38:36.033 --> 38:38.295
will be granted in December. And then he'll 
continue on as a college professor. That's what he

38:41.997 --> 38:45.582
wants to do the rest of his life is to teach 
accounting. It seems somewhat unusual that you

38:45.782 --> 38:53.232
became a general and neither of your brothers even 
went into the military. They were both of age

38:53.692 --> 38:57.798
during the Vietnam conflict. My little brother 
did. It's

38:59.480 --> 39:05.588
almost a comical story. My mother was afraid he was 
going to get drafted and she wanted him to be in the

39:05.608 --> 39:10.755
Air Force so she kept on him to volunteer for the Air 
Force. Well, at that time, there was a long waiting

39:14.173 --> 39:26.211
list to get in the Air Force because a lot of people 
wanted to get in the Air Force instead of the

39:14.173 --> 39:26.211
infantry because they felt their chances for 
survival or whatever, for whatever reasons.

39:26.231 --> 39:32.742
Well, he couldn't get in the Air Force, so he went 
down to join the Marine Corps so that he wouldn't

39:26.231 --> 39:32.742
have to go in the infantry. That's kind of like it. 
So in any event, he went up through the ranks. He

39:38.971 --> 39:39.392
never never really was called active duty because 
apparently the conflict ended about the time he

39:39.929 --> 39:45.434
completed his boot camp or what have you. So he 
stayed in the reserve for a number of years and

39:45.454 --> 39:51.680
worked his rank up to tech sergeant in the Marine 
Corps. And so then he just dropped out of the

39:51.700 --> 39:58.906
reserves to go ahead and continue with his 
schoolwork. But he's very seriously considering

39:58.946 --> 40:08.535
going back into applying for OTS or whatever the 
Marines call it and try to get a commission. and go

40:08.903 --> 40:10.925
back in the Marine Corps Reserve. So he's 
interested in that. He likes the Marines, wants to

40:14.308 --> 40:18.172
stay in the Marines. But he's not in the active 
reserve right now, although he was for a number of

40:18.392 --> 40:22.697
years. And your adopted brother, did he? No, he's 
never been in the military, never had any interest

40:25.579 --> 40:28.502
in it at all. I wonder why that is. I don't know. The 
difference between siblings here we're talking

40:34.308 --> 40:37.431
about. I have no idea. Of course, my interest in the 
military goes back. Oh, we're going to get to that.

40:46.738 --> 40:46.918
Oh, okay. I want to ask one last question about your 
parents, and that is that you became a general

40:47.299 --> 40:57.192
officer and a vice president of a university, 
obviously a success. In what way can you attribute

40:57.693 --> 41:02.239
that to your parents? I think they instilled in me 
the importance of hanging on. persistence.

41:15.609 --> 41:19.875
If I get a little emotional, it's because I'm 
remembering things that I don't remember too

41:15.609 --> 41:19.875
often.

41:24.260 --> 41:31.149
When I came to A&M, it cost $50 a month for room, 
board, books, uniforms, the whole works. We

41:31.169 --> 41:31.850
didn't have it. That's hard to believe that a 
family wouldn't have $50 a month. But...

41:41.092 --> 41:49.984
After dad would work on the mail route and mother 
would take care of the house, let me take a sip of

41:41.092 --> 41:49.984
coffee. This is kind of personal. But still, I'd 
like to answer it. No, I'd like to answer it. Give me

41:56.373 --> 41:57.135
just a minute here. It's time to turn this over. OK.

42:03.804 --> 42:11.014
But after the regular work day was over, they'd go 
out in the afternoon and pick cotton, send me to

42:03.804 --> 42:11.014
school. You think that won't impact you.

42:20.955 --> 42:28.045
But

42:20.955 --> 42:28.045
you don't forget things like that. And you just 
keep on keeping on and no matter what comes along,

42:29.406 --> 42:34.513
you just hang in there. And it always pays, 
especially if you're doing the right thing. But I

42:39.440 --> 42:40.782
think that Persistence and hanging on through 
adversity is the most important lesson I learned

42:41.369 --> 42:48.077
from mother and dad. Because we all have it. No 
matter how. All the siblings have it, you mean.

42:54.705 --> 42:54.925
Yes. And I think most people, now they may define it 
in different ways, but no matter how wealthy your

42:55.586 --> 43:05.037
family is, how poor they are, we all have 
adversity. Now what I may define as adversity,

43:05.097 --> 43:10.583
someone else may think, boy, how lucky can you get? 
But we all have problems. We all have to face it in

43:13.143 --> 43:14.624
our own way. And whatever way individuals can well 
up inside them to carry them through these bad

43:15.665 --> 43:27.376
times, that's what makes the difference, I think. 
And so I think that mother and dad instilled in me

43:29.518 --> 43:41.008
those important principles of hanging on and 
sticking with it and don't quit. just because the

43:42.372 --> 43:43.735
going gets tough. Does that kind of get to? Can you 
tell me about your education now? Yes, I sure can. I

43:52.412 --> 44:03.152
was, of course, once again went to Bruce Leddy 
schools up through my sophomore year in high

43:52.412 --> 44:03.152
school. Well, due to the influence of my two aunts 
who were nurses and of course my mother being a

44:04.799 --> 44:09.325
nurse. I'd been around doctors and hospitals and 
nurses and things like that. And mother was

44:13.890 --> 44:16.694
convinced that I would make a good doctor. She 
always had a dream that I would be a doctor. And in a

44:21.059 --> 44:28.108
little country school like ours, the only science 
course we had was vocational agriculture. No

44:28.128 --> 44:31.392
chemistry, no biology, none of that kind of thing. 
And so They arranged for me to go to school in Waco,

44:33.841 --> 44:38.889
Waco High School, which was one of the biggest high 
schools in the state. Well, I'd always been the

44:39.691 --> 44:43.978
leader in my little peer group, or one of the 
leaders. There were only about 20 kids in my whole

44:44.238 --> 44:52.932
high school class, half boys, half girls, and we 
all just kind of grew up together almost like a

44:44.238 --> 44:52.932
family. Well, I was thrust suddenly from the 
security of my surroundings and being tops in my

44:56.842 --> 45:08.757
class classically in a little bitty country 
school into one of the largest high schools in the

44:56.842 --> 45:08.757
state, just instantly, Waco High School. This is 
10th grade? This was beginning of my junior year,

45:09.999 --> 45:13.163
so it would have been the 11th grade. So you were 
about 15 or 16? I was 16, probably 17 maybe. And of

45:18.790 --> 45:24.638
course, I quickly made some friends, but I really 
never felt as myself of really being accepted in

45:25.850 --> 45:32.460
the high school because I was from a little country 
town. And plus the fact that a lot of them had had

45:33.442 --> 45:39.891
some backgrounds, some academic work that I had 
not had. So I had to study extra hard to make it. I was

45:42.295 --> 45:46.201
not a good scholar at Waco High School. I was 
valedictorian of my junior high class at Eddy. But

45:51.314 --> 45:53.602
I just buried and made it at Waco High School. And I 
was a very poor scholar here at A&M, primarily

45:53.622 --> 45:58.759
because my interests were in other areas.
