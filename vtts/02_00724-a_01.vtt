00:03.980 --> 00:24.828
First of all, Mr. Badgett, tell us something about 
your early life, including the names of your

00:03.980 --> 00:24.828
parents, the dates of their birth and death, if you 
know them, the places of their birth, the place and

00:03.980 --> 00:24.828
date of your birth, and schools which you attended 
before you came to Texas A&M.

00:28.413 --> 00:32.518
I was born in Denison, Texas, which is in Grayson 
County. near what is now the...

00:42.988 --> 00:55.963
In 1906, December 1st, 1906, my father was Walter 
Alexander Batchelor, born in Grayson County near

00:42.988 --> 00:55.963
Hector, Texas, which is near Whiteride. Am I 
speaking loud enough? My mother was also born in

00:58.967 --> 01:03.012
that area, Margate Alice Blanton, My 
grandfather, her father, and mother had migrated

01:03.397 --> 01:16.649
to Texas in the covered wagon train immediately 
after the Civil War from the Carolinas.

01:19.291 --> 01:22.894
I graduated from the Denison High School in 1924. 
Following

01:23.535 --> 01:33.083
that time, I spent a year at Austin College, which 
is in Sherman. about eight or nine miles from my

01:34.210 --> 01:43.218
home, commuting most of the time in urban, which 
was in use in those days, from Denison to Dallas and

01:34.210 --> 01:43.218
Waco.

01:47.022 --> 01:54.449
After a year there, taking a liberal arts course, I 
came to Texas A&M.

01:57.612 --> 02:02.496
What type of business was your father in, or what 
was his occupation? My father was a general

02:02.729 --> 02:10.220
building contractor in Denison, in that area, for 
quite a number of years. I don't remember,

02:11.963 --> 02:14.847
probably 40 years or something of that sort. He 
died during the war, at which time my two brothers

02:14.927 --> 02:27.606
were both overseas, one of them with patents on him 
and one of them with the 7th Army in northern New

02:14.927 --> 02:27.606
York. My mother's still alive. She is 92 years old 
now.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.225
She's still living in Denison? She is still living 
in Denison. My sister, who is the next youngest

02:40.068 --> 02:52.767
child of me in the family at 65 now, just retired and 
lives with my mother.

02:56.577 --> 03:04.905
What factors were involved in your change from, 
say, Austin College Liberal Arts to Texas A&M? I

03:06.526 --> 03:16.015
guess I probably went to Austin College because of 
its nearness and the fact that I had a scholarship

03:06.526 --> 03:16.015
there when I entered. And during that time, I 
believe it was January 19 and 23, I came to A&M for

03:25.400 --> 03:47.024
Texas, State Texas Older Boys Conference and 
spent several days here and was very favorably

03:25.400 --> 03:47.024
impressed with the college and having worked with 
my father in the construction business, I

03:25.400 --> 03:47.024
naturally had some feeling for looking toward 
architecture. And that is why I came here in the

03:48.345 --> 03:55.153
fall of 19 and 25. graduating with a BS in 
architecture on the mechanical structural end in

03:55.943 --> 04:17.533
19 and 29,

03:55.943 --> 04:17.533
followed by work on a master's degree in 
architecture that year, but didn't complete my

03:55.943 --> 04:17.533
thesis and get my degree until 19 and 32. In the 
meantime, I was working with the college

04:19.356 --> 04:24.583
architect In fact, I guess that may be of some 
interest how I came to work at A&M. Okay. Could we

04:31.363 --> 04:33.925
step back a minute on something else first? Sure. 
How were you, you entered A&M then as a sophomore?

04:41.251 --> 04:41.551
No. No? You had to enter as a fish? I had to enter as a 
freshman,

04:43.934 --> 04:54.823
changed into engineering, and taken military 
too. I restricted the transfer of credits that I

04:56.018 --> 05:05.432
could use on my architectural degree. In fact, I 
only got credit for English. The others were not

05:07.656 --> 05:10.139
applicable to the engineering course. So you did 
have to go through the whole freshman year. I was a

05:15.387 --> 05:21.216
freshman after I had met a slime, they called him up 
at Austin College at the time.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.516
What were your first reactions to the school? Of 
course, you had been here once before, or at least

05:27.536 --> 05:32.825
once, but not as a student. I presume it was 
somewhat different when you came as a student.

05:37.492 --> 05:42.801
Well, at the time I came down here, of course, there 
were not many highways. At that time, the Southern

05:44.404 --> 05:51.355
Pacific ran several trains, passenger trains, 
through College Station. I had left Denison on the

05:52.195 --> 05:58.644
Southern Pacific train to Dallas, where I 
transferred. That was in the afternoon. And in

06:02.109 --> 06:13.826
Dallas I ran into a chap named Rayford Lance from 
Sherman, who was a sophomore, to be a sophomore at

06:02.109 --> 06:13.826
A&M. And we transferred to the, what was then 
called the Owl, a midnight train from left Dallas

06:20.832 --> 06:26.120
about 11.30, arriving at college at 4.30 in the 
morning.

06:28.904 --> 06:35.734
We got off the train in a rain at 4.30 in the morning. 
And of course, it was pretty dark around there

06:36.015 --> 06:38.619
then. And we carried our handbags. Of course, we 
had trunks, so we had to get later. Handbag up to the

06:46.491 --> 06:49.455
campus. Lance having been here a year, we rustled 
around and found an empty bed on the bottom floor of

06:49.807 --> 07:02.004
Leggett Hall and spent the rest of the night there. 
And then of course that day was registration day

07:04.147 --> 07:13.761
and one of the questions then, well what outfit are 
you going to be in? What military science are you

07:13.901 --> 07:15.804
going to take? What company are you going to get in? 
And I had met some other prospective freshmen

07:19.945 --> 07:32.119
during the early morning, and we agreed we would 
get in some company if we could. I don't remember

07:32.219 --> 07:40.168
that now, but I wound up in A Infantry because the 
company we had planned to get in was full at the

07:32.219 --> 07:40.168
time. And fortunately continued living like it 
was. The infantry was in Leggett that year and back

07:46.675 --> 07:50.900
in there my junior year. My sophomore year we had, I 
always thought the fortunate thing of being able

07:52.461 --> 08:01.311
to live in what was called Hollywood Shacks. That 
was an interesting place for anyone but a

08:02.432 --> 08:05.295
freshman. We had running wood and water and of 
course the freshmen ran after the wood and we ran

08:05.795 --> 08:14.725
after the water and the toilets were in a common 
latrine over On the side of these shacks, I think

08:15.835 --> 08:31.081
there were about 130 of them, about 16 by 16 square, 
and there must have been an acre of cordwood sawed

08:15.835 --> 08:31.081
and stacked up there because your house was heated 
with a wood stove. How many students assigned to a

08:32.984 --> 08:35.548
shack? Three. There were room, usually you 
stacked two cots, One of them, there could be four

08:42.515 --> 08:44.417
in there. It was a fairly good sized room, 
approximately 16 by 16. And three could live in

08:48.321 --> 08:50.863
there comfortably. And we, being sophomores, had 
lots of fun there. Of course, it was right

08:57.710 --> 09:03.536
convenient for people to drown out others, 
because usually your bed was in front of a window.

09:03.576 --> 09:07.240
There were three windows and a door in the room.

09:08.502 --> 09:12.607
During the night, you may get a GI can of water 
thrown in through the window on you. Another

09:14.549 --> 09:34.071
common fun thing was while the students were out in 
the mess hall for evening meal, someone might plug

09:14.549 --> 09:34.071
your stovepipe and put sulfur or something else on 
your stove, which made it rather untenable to live

09:14.549 --> 09:34.071
in for a while afterwards. I could imagine that it 
would. Wasn't burning of sulfur commonly used for

09:37.322 --> 09:40.885
bedbugs? No, well, just somebody getting some 
powdered sulfur or something that would stink and

09:40.905 --> 09:46.891
smoke up the room. I haven't stopped up your 
chimney, too, your stovepipe. So you got both the

09:52.517 --> 09:55.600
sulfur and the smoke. We lived right by the shack I 
was in, I think it was 102, and it was right beside

09:56.060 --> 10:05.610
the Tunerville Trolley, which in those days ran 
from College Station to Bryan at what I thought was

10:06.552 --> 10:17.625
the best example of motion going in all directions 
at once of anything you could find. In

10:17.645 --> 10:34.686
fact, I've even got nauseated or motion sickness 
from riding it from Bryan to College Station after

10:17.645 --> 10:34.686
having dinner occasionally in town on Saturday 
night.

10:37.180 --> 10:40.105
You said you lived in the Hollywood Shacks for only 
one year. Well, those times your outfits rotated

10:40.906 --> 10:44.872
around. It didn't always stay in the same 
dormitories every year. For how long were the

10:50.000 --> 10:53.566
Hollywood Shacks there, do you remember? When I 
came down here first for this older boys'

10:53.586 --> 11:03.441
conference in 1924, I think it was January 24, At 
that time they had tents. These were out in front of

11:07.224 --> 11:13.854
the YMCA building where Law and Pereer Hall are now 
located. They had a wooden deck floor and then a

11:15.797 --> 11:30.519
pyramidal tent and the students lived in those 
tents which at the time I was down here it snowed and

11:15.797 --> 11:30.519
I guess rather uncomfortable in a tent in the 
wintertime in the snow. But by the time I had come

11:31.500 --> 11:34.845
back the following year they had built a hundred 
some odd of these Hollywood shacks, we called

11:36.158 --> 11:42.627
them, out there where the tents were. These

11:42.647 --> 11:58.588
stayed in that location until Law and Prayer Hall 
were erected, which would be 1926, I believe, and

11:42.647 --> 11:58.588
started in 1927. And that area and what they did is 
simply moved them on back further toward the

11:59.885 --> 12:11.536
railroad track and what is now the parking lot 
beside Law and Career Hall. Where they were

12:11.556 --> 12:15.419
continued to be used as dormitory rooms. They were 
used as dormitory rooms. I don't remember when we

12:19.083 --> 12:21.625
discontinued them now. They were sold off and

12:21.685 --> 12:26.770
floated all over Rises County people have brought 
them up because they're a nice little house. I've

12:32.055 --> 12:36.220
been told that there's still some in existence in a 
few places. There were a few on the campus till not

12:36.300 --> 12:45.793
very many years ago that were used for storage 
sheds. In fact, Cashin Cabin down in Hensel Park is

12:45.813 --> 12:55.265
composed of three of those cabins that were put 
together to make one house. It originally was down

12:55.525 --> 12:57.027
in

13:00.449 --> 13:23.790
where a lake was in the horticulture farm area just 
west of the railroad and when they built the ag

13:00.449 --> 13:23.790
engineering building or the greenhouses, the 
first time this cabin was moved down to Hensel

13:00.449 --> 13:23.790
Park, used as a recreational area for quite a 
number of years and still is in existence there

13:00.449 --> 13:23.790
now. You mentioned that you lived in Leggett as a 
fish and as a junior. Where did you live as a senior?

13:34.580 --> 13:39.765
As a senior, I lived in the north corner on the third 
floor of Mitchell Hall. I remember the rooms in

13:42.107 --> 13:48.632
Leggett Hall, 51 my freshman year and 55 my junior 
year.

13:51.415 --> 13:55.498
I don't know what the number was, didn't make a 
difference, but I lived in the only actually the

13:55.732 --> 14:04.504
third floor, with Richard Akers, who graduated 
with me. You mentioned that in the Hollywood

14:05.586 --> 14:13.817
shacks it was fairly convenient for drowning out 
at night or stuffing up the stove. What was life

14:15.039 --> 14:17.141
like in the main dormitories? I would imagine it 
would be a little bit more difficult or

14:17.262 --> 14:25.553
complicated for drowning out, and of course, 
stuffing up the stovepipe was not a possibility

14:17.262 --> 14:25.553
there. In Leggett Hall, we slept in three bunks 
strapped to each other, one above the other. My

14:34.285 --> 14:38.930
first three years in A&M, I had two roommates. One 
was Carol Dautre from Houston and Johnny Yonick

14:40.151 --> 14:46.218
from Weimar. Yonick died during the war.

14:52.685 --> 14:55.067
The fellow who drew the top bunk In the wintertime, 
never had to have any cover. We had radiators in the

14:57.801 --> 15:04.929
room, and of course the higher up you got near the 
ceiling, the warmer it was. So it got pretty warm up

15:05.931 --> 15:11.097
there in the winter. Now going back to the shacks, 
for a moment, the wood stoves we had in there made

15:12.118 --> 15:24.193
awfully nice places to have a weenie roast or do 
some other cooking that you might improvise on a

15:25.017 --> 15:54.248
cold winter evening, but I guess one of the big 
differences was of course you had a company

15:25.017 --> 15:54.248
usually had a floor and maybe part of another and 
two floors, but at that time it was common practice

15:25.017 --> 15:54.248
for any upperclassman who wanted any errand run or 
any work done for him to stick his head out the door

15:25.017 --> 15:54.248
and holler freshman. and all the freshmen on the 
floor had to break their neck getting there

15:54.498 --> 16:03.169
because the last one there was the one who got the 
chore. So sometimes it got to be quite a rat race,

16:04.490 --> 16:13.001
students making their way to the, trying to get 
there first rather than last. And there was no way

16:14.803 --> 16:20.370
of knowing in advance what the responsibility 
might be. And of course most In the dormitories, in

16:24.333 --> 16:34.967
the shacks, the freshman students always had the 
job of cleaning up the upperclassmen's room. You

16:35.007 --> 16:45.941
were usually assigned to some upperclassmen's 
room, and that was your chore to make up the beds,

16:35.007 --> 16:45.941
change the linen, and sweep the floors, and wash 
the basin, what have you. This was always an

16:46.802 --> 16:50.346
unofficial responsibility, though. Well, yeah, 
but you knew what your job was. After

16:55.619 --> 17:05.951
you became an upperclassman, I assume then you had 
a choice of who would be your fish? Normally you

17:07.853 --> 17:09.796
did, yes. Where one

17:10.497 --> 17:20.288
freshman didn't have too many rooms, they used 
enough freshmen to go around and keep it up. Of

17:20.408 --> 17:22.791
course, there were some rooms that freshmen 
detested very much having to clean up because

17:24.087 --> 17:32.255
naturally some people aren't as neat and clean as 
others. But there was not necessarily a rotation.

17:35.238 --> 17:41.023
No, you might keep your assignment for the 
semester. Sometimes it would change, but there

17:42.805 --> 17:46.729
was no real method about it.

17:49.832 --> 17:53.335
What about the food that was served to you in a mess 
hall? uh pretty good or did you have a lot of

17:54.040 --> 18:23.980
complaints about it well it was my observation 
that there was hardly a freshman who came here i'm

17:54.040 --> 18:23.980
speaking particularly the freshman now who 
didn't gain weight that year of course this was due

17:54.040 --> 18:23.980
to two things probably a regularity of work and 
sleep and meals plus meal hounding it was called

17:54.040 --> 18:23.980
then At the tables, you were seated by companies, 
as I guess it's done now in Duncan Hall. But it was

18:31.770 --> 18:35.333
your job to seat the upperclassmen. We're fed 
first, and then if anything was left, you might

18:35.353 --> 18:43.142
fill up on gunwadding and regulator. Regulator, 
it was molasses, and of course gunwadding was

18:43.422 --> 18:47.706
bread. And crews from table to table to find 
something was left over to fill up. And a lot of

18:55.246 --> 19:05.219
them, a lot of students had made quite a fetish out 
of trying to bring things out of the mess hall. Of

19:05.420 --> 19:17.236
course, they had an army sergeant stationed at 
each door to try to check people to keep them from

19:05.420 --> 19:17.236
carrying off all the silverware in China and food. 
But they were very innovative. methods that were

19:22.145 --> 19:33.676
worked up to get out with a pie, or maybe it was bread 
and molasses, or whatever they might find they

19:22.145 --> 19:33.676
want to bring up. And particularly, the freshmen 
had the job of bringing food out to some of the

19:33.756 --> 19:45.368
upperclassmen who didn't like to get up on Sunday 
morning and go down for breakfast. So on Sunday

19:45.388 --> 19:47.850
morning, and you weren't required. Sunday 
morning breakfast was voluntary, no formation.

19:51.457 --> 19:54.380
Every other day it was by formation. By formation 
you fell in and then marched to the dining hall.

20:01.286 --> 20:12.636
Usually at retreat in the spring and the fall

20:01.286 --> 20:12.636
we had retreat formation with a band playing and 
the cadet corps marching in. The military walk was

20:13.656 --> 20:18.140
a military walk in those days. It was closed off to 
vehicular traffic and During the week, you

20:22.253 --> 20:30.140
marched from wherever your dormitory was down the 
Military Walk to Speza Hall. On Sunday morning,

20:31.321 --> 20:35.425
you marched the other way to Guyon Hall for 
Compulsory Chapel.

20:39.048 --> 20:51.619
I think one of the most embarrassing

20:39.048 --> 20:51.619
occurrences my senior year, my organization at 
that time, formed in front of Leggett Hall between

20:53.320 --> 21:07.333
Leggett and Mitchell, down in that area, and we 
were the first outfit to march in the dining hall.

21:07.373 --> 21:16.482
On Sunday nights, well, half of Brian, it seemed, 
came out to watch the cadet corps parade in the

21:07.373 --> 21:16.482
dining hall. I was a cadet staff officer in the I 
remember the first Sunday evening it came my lot to

21:21.839 --> 21:31.668
take the cadet corps to the dining hall after 
retreat. I was down just in front of the dining hall

21:31.688 --> 21:43.419
and of course was facing the organizations and 
giving some commands and then did an about face to

21:31.688 --> 21:43.419
march off. Well, we wore boots as they do now and 
spurs. And somehow or another when I did my about

21:48.890 --> 21:55.921
face and had my feet together and then stepped off, 
my feet didn't go with me. I went but my feet didn't.

21:57.523 --> 22:07.599
My spurs got hung together and locked and I fell 
flat before all the crowd out there in front of the

21:57.523 --> 22:07.599
dining hall. I would imagine that would be a rather 
embarrassing situation.

22:20.362 --> 22:30.593
At

22:20.362 --> 22:30.593
the time when you were a student, did you have a 
guard mount in the evening during the quiet hour?

22:31.634 --> 22:49.153
No, we didn't have a guard mount, but you had called 
quarters and the senior company commander or his

22:31.634 --> 22:49.153
assistant, it was his job to see that you didn't 
roam around and and visit, and if you left during

22:50.332 --> 23:15.090
call to quarters, which I believe was between 7.30 
and 10.30 or 10.45,

22:50.332 --> 23:15.090
you were not to leave the dormitory or rooms unless 
you got permission and then you had to post notice

22:50.332 --> 23:15.090
on your door where you had gone and when you'd be 
back. But there was no one walking guard to her to

23:16.403 --> 23:21.831
see that you were there. But the matter of posting a 
notice was for all classes, not just the freshmen?

23:28.180 --> 23:37.773
I don't remember that it applied particularly to 
the upper class when they had, of course, a little

23:28.180 --> 23:37.773
more freedom than the freshmen.

23:37.793 --> 23:44.723
But the regular guard mount had been discontinued 
some years before I came.

23:47.572 --> 23:59.547
You mentioned the fact that perhaps the 
upperclassmen had more freedom than the freshmen

23:47.572 --> 23:59.547
as far as moving around the dormitory at night and 
not having to post a notice of where they were. What

24:00.268 --> 24:02.791
other privileges did upperclassmen have?

24:05.915 --> 24:08.598
I think we talked earlier about the upperclassmen 
were fed. They got the first choice of the meal at

24:08.759 --> 24:12.523
the mess hall.

24:16.008 --> 24:17.089
Of course, they got there. rooms clean.

24:21.698 --> 24:23.801
I don't know of any particular ones. Passes to 
leave the campus were a little more lenient, but if

24:24.142 --> 24:41.406
you weren't 21, you still were supposed to either 
get an individual or a standing permit, one from

24:24.142 --> 24:41.406
your parents, to authorize you to leave the 
campus.

24:42.601 --> 24:46.485
to go anywhere other than Bryan or College 
Station, of course. Well, College Station wasn't

24:46.525 --> 24:48.867
here then.

24:52.270 --> 24:57.876
A large number of the staff and faculty lived on the 
campus. It seemed like we had somewhere around

24:57.896 --> 25:09.587
250, 300

24:57.896 --> 25:09.587
faculty houses altogether, both on the campus and 
some off on the farms.

25:12.385 --> 25:36.773
In fact, the block that the Student Center 
occupies now was completely filled with faculty,

25:12.385 --> 25:36.773
cottages, and all down from that block, well, 
where the new athletic dormitory is just

25:12.385 --> 25:36.773
finished, was houses.

25:39.723 --> 25:43.447
Raleigh White Coliseum is on both sides of that. 
And then, of course, behind Guyon Hall on the side

25:43.567 --> 25:54.078
of the present Tower Center now. And on down

25:54.098 --> 26:01.146
what was called Quality Row. That's a street that 
goes down now past the President's House and

26:10.283 --> 26:11.444
General Ludeke lives. This was called Quality Row 
because on that street the heads of departments

26:12.425 --> 26:22.056
and directors and some of the deans lived. Was that 
the street where those original brick houses? The

26:25.540 --> 26:35.411
original brick houses were on the side of the park 
alongside just west of the dormitories, the 12

26:25.540 --> 26:35.411
dormitories. And I believe there were also some 
faculty houses over where the USDA That's right.

26:40.929 --> 26:52.564
The area that the, what we called then the four 
dormitories, at one time were 14, 15, 16, 17. And

26:52.605 --> 27:01.476
where the USDA building is now, 500-inch staff 
houses occupied that area. And then on up where the

27:01.576 --> 27:08.185
more recent dormitories were built there, I'm not 
familiar with the names of those now. Between

27:11.188 --> 27:27.504
there and the U.S. Post Office were houses, and 
then there was old Alpha and Beta Hall, which were

27:11.188 --> 27:27.504
two-story frame buildings where the casuals 
lived. We called the students who were not taking

27:27.524 --> 27:38.695
military science, either been in World War I or 
were physically disabled or were rather old, not

27:39.805 --> 27:50.181
taking military science, and then the Cadet Corps 
were called casuals, and they lived in those

27:39.805 --> 27:50.181
buildings. And then in 19, what, 26th, I forget the 
year now, the Aggieland Inn was constructed on the

27:51.583 --> 28:01.478
site of these. And for many years, was the only 
state owned hotel in the United States.

28:12.957 --> 28:19.627
Used to be quite a center for food, coffee, and a two 
dollar room. Somewhere in our picture file, we

28:21.910 --> 28:27.639
have a picture of a Shirley Hotel, which was 
considerably earlier. Do you know where that was?

28:29.762 --> 28:34.990
Yes, the Shirley Hotel

28:29.762 --> 28:34.990
was just opposite the Board of Directors' 
quarters. At that time there was a road that curved

28:37.935 --> 29:04.774
off of Houston Street about the Board of 
Directors' room and went on down to one of the north

28:37.935 --> 29:04.774
gates where the interurban from, or Tunerville 
Trolley we always called it, the interurban from

28:37.935 --> 29:04.774
Bryan College Station left the campus or entered 
the campus. And then

29:05.345 --> 29:20.003
beside the street and the track there was what was 
Postgraduate Hall, PG Hall, where graduate

29:05.345 --> 29:20.003
students lived. And across the street from that 
was the old bachelor's quarters, which I lived in

29:20.023 --> 29:34.761
for a year after I graduated.

29:36.412 --> 29:41.320
But there were many occupants left around here 
that John Paul happened to work with. Yeah, I see.

29:42.522 --> 29:45.908
Duke Thornton lived in Batchelor Quarters, 
Batchelor Hall. He was the head of me there. He

29:48.592 --> 29:52.639
married at that time. Let's see. There was T.R. 
Spence, with whom I had the pleasure of working a

29:56.886 --> 30:02.335
number of years when he was manager of 
construction for the A&M system, was born on the

30:04.255 --> 30:09.783
campus. And I believe one of the houses, I mean that 
Dean Spence lived on the site I believe of the

30:11.606 --> 30:20.599
student center. And I believe Guy Adrens was born 
on the campus too.
