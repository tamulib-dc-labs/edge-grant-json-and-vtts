WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:19.947
Just distinctly remember that all these tables 
set up in Duncan and you went in there by your

00:02.427 --> 00:19.947
alphabet and there was a strategy and one of the 
upperclassmen talked to me about the strategy,

00:02.427 --> 00:19.947
but I was convinced at the end of it that the rest of 
the semester would be easy after registration.

00:24.763 --> 00:40.669
Registration was the hardest thing, because 
you'd get five of your six courses, and then the

00:24.763 --> 00:40.669
sixth one you couldn't get, so you'd have to go back 
and start changing things, and it was all done, it

00:24.763 --> 00:40.669
was all manual, and you were trying to get... One of 
the good parts about it, I'm an early riser. I was

00:44.871 --> 00:46.273
always an early riser. So I liked 8 o'clock. And not 
a lot of people like 8 o'clock. And so Monday,

00:50.477 --> 00:56.264
Wednesday, Friday 8, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8, 
I could get those courses. And I liked my courses in

00:56.364 --> 01:02.271
the morning because I seemed to have a lull in the 
afternoon. And so I tried to have the labs in the

01:02.651 --> 01:07.737
afternoon, the coursework in the morning. uh... 
because the lab work you were active and you know

01:08.375 --> 01:33.707
that was you could kind of keep focus there but i 
remember uh... registration being very

01:08.375 --> 01:33.707
difficult were some of those first semester 
courses important as you look back now do you

01:08.375 --> 01:33.707
remember some of them some of the teachers well 
first you know i took 105 and you were my instructor

01:08.375 --> 01:33.707
did you also teach 106 history 106 see i don't know 
if i had you both years both semesters or not But I

01:33.923 --> 01:38.312
made two B's in 105 and 106, you know, freshman 
history. You

01:39.394 --> 01:50.616
know, pre-vet was kind of neat in that they were 
preparing you not only for the sciences, but they

01:39.394 --> 01:50.616
were also preparing you. to run a business. So you 
took English literature, you took business

01:52.363 --> 02:00.474
courses, you took history. And I remember the only 
thing my daddy told me was take the hard courses and

02:01.455 --> 02:11.548
take the courses that make you think and make you 
write. So when I had a choice, I was always thinking

02:12.429 --> 02:15.773
about that. Does this course And like I remember 
taking speech and they they everybody was

02:18.119 --> 02:28.713
avoiding that and my daddy, you know said, you know 
That was being able to communicate was important.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.095
So I took speech. I made good grading speeches 
speech course And so I did well in the liberal arts

02:30.115 --> 02:45.696
courses And I did okay in math, but I didn't do good 
in chemistries matter of fact chemistry was why I

02:46.030 --> 02:48.154
didn't get in vet school. And it was organic 
chemistry, Dr. Rose. And what the funniest part

02:52.161 --> 03:03.000
about that whole chemistry experience, because I 
took eight hours of chemistry my freshman year,

02:52.161 --> 03:03.000
eight more my sophomore year, so it was 16 hours of 
chemistry. So I was in the chemistry building a

03:03.621 --> 03:05.625
lot. And I remember bringing my children back to 
A&M once, and you could still drive around the

03:07.023 --> 03:14.192
campus then, and they were little. And I said, I 
need to go show you the chemistry building. I said,

03:17.637 --> 03:23.264
the only thing I really remember about it is it had 
90 steps or something leading to the top. Well, I

03:23.324 --> 03:25.086
found it. I knew exactly where it was. It had 13 
steps. And so for some reason, I thought that you

03:28.731 --> 03:34.819
had to walk forever to get up to the deck of the 
chemistry building. And I remember liking Dr.

03:34.985 --> 03:37.588
Rose. He was my organic chemistry teacher, and I 
thought he was a good instructor. But I didn't do

03:43.114 --> 03:49.321
well in organic chemistry, and that was the reason 
I didn't get in vet school. I mean, that was, you

03:49.561 --> 03:56.289
know, because Dr. Romaine said, Randy, we split 
your GPR. We look at your liberal arts, and we go,

03:56.329 --> 04:02.916
oh, hum, and we look at your sciences, and that's 
what we focus on. And you've got good grades in

04:03.638 --> 04:16.658
history and English in those courses, and you've 
got okay grades in math, but chemistry and

04:03.638 --> 04:16.658
physics, you know, you're a C student. And he says, 
you know, we've learned that vet students who are C

04:17.319 --> 04:27.435
students in organic, you know, don't make it 
through vet school. And so, you know, you're going

04:28.040 --> 04:30.183
to have a hard time. Now, I took veterinary 
genetics and made an A in it. They let me take that.

04:33.887 --> 04:47.545
And so there was some sciences, biology I did well 
in because it was kind of, you know, there was bugs

04:33.887 --> 04:47.545
and animals and I could relate it to a lot of things 
in the ranch that I knew, farming and ranching. But

04:47.605 --> 04:52.832
chemistry just didn't, I just didn't apply 
myself. Back to that fall semester. As you got into

04:58.904 --> 05:11.785
your company and into your outfit and started the 
routine, describe a typical day, class day. What

05:11.866 --> 05:12.987
time did you get up? What did you do when?

05:16.954 --> 05:19.739
You know, a Monday through Friday.

05:23.084 --> 05:23.545
Yeah. as a fish we didn't seem to wake up real early i 
mean i woke up a long time before anybody else and

05:25.415 --> 05:44.672
everybody was asleep and so i did some studying and 
thinking early and then there was whistles and uh

05:45.412 --> 05:47.775
you were whistle jock, and that was tough duty. And 
I remember the first time I had a whistle jock, but

05:49.176 --> 05:57.125
you had to run through the halls and blow the 
whistle, and the first whistle was wake up, I

05:49.176 --> 05:57.125
guess. And then it was about 20 minutes later, 
there was a second whistle, or it was two whistles,

05:58.646 --> 06:11.200
the guy would, you'd go through and you'd blow 
twice, and that meant you had five minutes to

05:58.646 --> 06:11.200
formation. So there was 20 minutes and that's when 
you shaved and got dressed and everything. And

06:19.086 --> 06:25.240
then you had this five minute call and then you had a 
about a three-minute call, and then it was

06:25.726 --> 06:28.830
fallout. And it seemed like the fallout was 
hollered by the first sergeant. Mickey Ballard

06:32.555 --> 06:35.779
was my first sergeant, and I liked him a lot. And 
he'd holler out, and we'd fall out, and then we'd

06:36.540 --> 06:47.875
stand there in formation and be inspected, and 
then we'd march to Morning Chow. And I remember...

06:51.427 --> 06:57.172
you know, telling my mother that not only did I not 
like shoes, that I didn't know how to march. And she

06:58.674 --> 07:04.099
said, and she says, well, Randy, they'll teach 
you. And I'll never forget, it was one, two, I mean,

07:05.200 --> 07:16.070
they taught us by the numbers how to left face, 
right face, about face, and then how to march off

07:05.200 --> 07:16.070
with our left and how to keep your thumbs down. And 
what was really interesting for 33 years in the

07:20.030 --> 07:29.365
Army, is West Pointers march well and Aggies march 
well, and not many other ROTC cadets know how to

07:20.030 --> 07:29.365
march. And if you see an Air Force officer in the 
Army that knows how to salute, he's from A&M,

07:30.868 --> 07:44.029
because the Air Force doesn't focus on things like 
that, but the Air Force ROTC at A&M did, And so when I

07:44.161 --> 07:56.996
would, you know, through the years, and I had five 
joint assignments, so I was with a lot of Air Force

07:44.161 --> 07:56.996
officers, and I would see one salute, I would know 
whether it was an Aggie just because he knew how to

07:44.161 --> 07:56.996
salute properly. So A&M did a good job there at the 
beginning of teaching us the military skills and

07:57.316 --> 08:12.193
the discipline, and then we'd march to chow, and we 
had the longest way to march, and we'd sing our

07:57.316 --> 08:12.193
chodis, and we'd march in. And then we ate family 
style. And then there was cadets that were our

08:15.859 --> 08:24.748
waiters, the cadets that were kind of working 
their way through school, and they would get money

08:15.859 --> 08:24.748
for waiting tables. And you would sit there at a 
table with upperclassmen and you would eat square

08:25.538 --> 08:31.505
meals forever. It seemed like you had to eat 
square. And you had, of course, you had names for

08:34.468 --> 08:40.935
all the chow. And you passed all the chow to each 
other and make a round. And if you wanted seconds,

08:45.220 --> 08:47.282
you'd have to ask for that. But I remember not 
eating a lot at first because of the campusology

08:48.083 --> 08:53.689
questions. And I kind of resented it, except as I 
look back,

08:55.643 --> 09:05.495
the motivation to eat. Because the chow was pretty 
good. I mean, I thought the chow was good. And there

09:10.380 --> 09:12.102
was plenty of it. And you were hungry. And so the 
motivation to be able to eat was to learn your

09:14.806 --> 09:18.950
campusology. And learning campusology was not, I 
loved the way they did it. and I don't know when they

09:24.668 --> 09:28.874
started it and if they still do it, but it wasn't in a 
book. So just if you were a good memorizer, it

09:30.396 --> 09:33.921
didn't help you. You had to go and see Lawrence 
Sullivan Ross, 1838, 1898, soldier, state, or

09:34.502 --> 09:52.228
scholarly gentleman, first president of Texas 
A&M, and you had to go find Lawrence Sullivan Ross,

09:34.502 --> 09:52.228
and you had to copy that inscription down in your 
little notebook, and then you could memorize it.

09:53.609 --> 09:56.392
And you went all over campus doing that. So within a 
few days, you knew the campus or you didn't need

09:56.492 --> 10:01.638
anything. Do you remember some trick questions, 
some cush questions that were kind of tricky? Oh, I

10:10.228 --> 10:13.852
don't recall that at all, sir. The favorite one 
that I have learned is, and see if you can answer

10:14.112 --> 10:21.861
this, how many stars are there in the Texas flag? I 
vaguely remember that question, and I don't know

10:23.191 --> 10:31.248
what the trick answer was. Whatever you say, 
the... interrogator will answer the other one. If

10:37.849 --> 10:40.993
you say one, he'll say no, there's two, there's one 
on each side. If you say two, he'll say no, it's one,

10:41.434 --> 10:44.958
and it goes through both ways. So the questions 
y'all had were real questions. I thought were

10:50.645 --> 10:51.806
straightforward. The other thing that I thought 
was good, I didn't think it at the time, but I did

10:52.147 --> 11:04.001
later, was the emphasis on everybody's names. And 
so because no one's name is... I mean, that's the

11:10.095 --> 11:31.985
most important thing to a person, and I started 
figuring that out at A&M because I was never very

11:10.095 --> 11:31.985
good with names before then, but you had to know 
everybody's name, and you had to know all the

11:10.095 --> 11:31.985
football players' names, the first team offense, 
first team defense, what their number was, their

11:10.095 --> 11:31.985
name was, and what city they were from, the town 
where they were from in Houston and Texas. And

11:32.866 --> 11:34.288
so... And so all those things, the motivation was 
to eat, and the things they were trying to teach you

11:34.589 --> 11:48.016
were important. The only thing that I would have 
done different, and I did when I was a sophomore,

11:52.983 --> 11:56.868
was I would explain to the fish why we were doing 
these things. That wasn't, no one explained why

11:57.589 --> 12:00.734
when I was a fish. I started figuring it out, and I 
guess that was okay. But I found out later in

12:05.440 --> 12:18.338
Vietnam, as an infantry company commander going 
from foxhole to foxhole every night, every

12:05.440 --> 12:18.338
foxhole of three to four men would say, why are we in 
Vietnam? And so... You know, I always felt it was

12:22.244 --> 12:30.434
important, when you had time, to tell people why, 
from a leadership skill perspective. All right,

12:31.215 --> 12:37.944
you finished child, then you had to hurry to your 
eight o'clock class because you had a good

12:31.215 --> 12:37.944
distance to cover. Yes, and the toughest part 
about that was whipping out, and that's another

12:39.045 --> 12:49.078
way you, if you wanted to get to class on time, you 
better remember the people you met because if you

12:49.868 --> 13:04.104
knew them and you could say, howdy, Mr. Jones, sir, 
from, you know, Muleshoe, sir, taking veterinary

12:49.868 --> 13:04.104
medicine, sir, you passed. You just kept going. 
But if you didn't know that, you'd have to turn

13:05.986 --> 13:08.669
around and whip out. And then depending on how 
obnoxious the guy was or how mad or how much he

13:08.929 --> 13:18.660
wanted to mess with you, he would walk you 100, 200, 
300 yards away away from your point of destination

13:19.298 --> 13:45.559
and to the point where almost in self-defense you 
really started and as soon as I would get to class I

13:19.298 --> 13:45.559
distinctly remember writing names down because I 
figured my learning abilities

13:19.298 --> 13:45.559
and it was really interesting because I used this 
for years in the military I had to both write and

13:47.041 --> 13:49.685
listen. I couldn't just listen.

13:54.192 --> 14:04.807
Whatever my learning and brain housing group was, 
it took both of those, effective listening and

13:54.192 --> 14:04.807
writing the name. If I would write the name down, 
and think about it, there was a chance I'd remember

14:08.624 --> 14:12.070
it. If I didn't write it down, I'd see that guy 
again. He'd know me, I'd know him, and I wouldn't

14:15.135 --> 14:19.322
know his name, and we would go through that drill. 
Right. You had classes pretty well all morning.

14:23.208 --> 14:23.509
Yes. Then go back and fall in, march to China. 
Right. Then in the afternoon, labs. What did you do

14:32.163 --> 14:34.767
if you had any unscheduled classes? Well, for me, I 
was, there was, our company was heavy into

14:35.067 --> 14:43.137
intramurals. And I couldn't, I wasn't big enough 
to play Aggie football, but we had a heck of a, you

14:45.100 --> 14:52.470
know, a touch flag football team. And so as soon as, 
I mean, I don't know when practice started, but we

14:53.831 --> 15:03.204
would practice every day, you know, and there was a 
core group of us. Where would y'all practice?

15:04.480 --> 15:11.749
Well, right now there's dorms built there, but it 
was between 17 and the athletic dorms there was an

15:04.480 --> 15:11.749
open field. In Henderson. In Henderson, right. 
And there was a series of marked-off fields, and I

15:14.893 --> 15:32.715
guess every company was designated one or 
something because we seemed to go to a different

15:14.893 --> 15:32.715
one every time, but there were several fields 
there that were just, I think they were only 80

15:14.893 --> 15:32.715
yards or 60 yards long, but there were enough 
fields for a good flag football practice. And

15:35.561 --> 15:41.751
having some high school football experience, did 
that help you gain acceptance in the outfit? Oh

15:41.771 --> 15:50.185
yeah, I was not a great football player through all 
my growing up. I had all the heart in the world and I

15:50.285 --> 15:53.590
was determined And the coaches would let me play 
because I was so dedicated in everything. But when

16:01.081 --> 16:04.608
we started playing intramural football, I was a 
star. And all of a sudden, you were the go-to guy.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.322
and the quarterback was an upperclassman. You 
very seldom had a fish quarterback, and so the

16:14.342 --> 16:19.028
quarterback's an upperclassman, and I was a 
receiver. And, you know, so. But back if you had,

16:21.371 --> 16:27.518
let's say, an unscheduled hour between 10 and 11, 
what did you and your buddies do? Well, I had two

16:27.978 --> 16:37.569
wonderful friends, the Melton twins from Lamar, 
who were on a football scholarship. They lived in

16:37.789 --> 16:38.851
Henderson Hall. And there was no harassing in 
Henderson Hall. And so I would, at first, I would

16:41.933 --> 16:48.882
always go to Henderson Hall any time I had a break. 
And they left their room unlocked or something,

16:49.343 --> 16:54.169
and I would go in there and study. After the other 
place that I found was the library, they couldn't

16:54.970 --> 17:01.919
arrest you in the library. And so I would, a lot of 
times your classes were pretty close to the

17:02.760 --> 17:10.590
library, so I would just beat it to the library. and 
get up on the second deck or something, those big

17:11.583 --> 17:17.831
wooden tables, and just study there in time. Later 
I found out that for some reason they didn't harass

17:19.353 --> 17:29.866
you in the MSC when you were, there's all these 
little cubicles kind of in the MSC. There was no

17:31.067 --> 17:35.312
prohibition against harassing, but just nobody 
felt like doing it. I think the term Memorial

17:35.432 --> 17:38.316
Student Center kind of took the edge off of the 
upperclassmen. And so sometimes you could go to

17:40.970 --> 17:46.856
the MSC and do some studying. And I was pretty 
conscientious about all that. I mean, I wasn't a

17:50.360 --> 17:51.942
good student. I mean, I wasn't a great student, and 
I didn't like school. But I knew that I wanted to be a

17:55.165 --> 17:59.069
veterinarian, and I knew I had to make certain 
grades. And school was hard work for me. And so I was

18:03.102 --> 18:06.867
pretty diligent in just trying to study. Plus, I 
didn't like staying up late at night. I was not a

18:11.133 --> 18:12.195
night owl. I got up early in the morning, but I went 
to bed with chickens back then. And so I had to do a

18:15.980 --> 18:20.526
lot of my studying during the day. All right. 
You're getting involved in all these activities,

18:22.830 --> 18:26.595
and then... here come some of the first big Aggie 
traditional events. I presume Yale practice

18:31.801 --> 18:38.472
would have been about, would have happened before 
a Silver Taps or anything like that. Well, yeah,

18:38.833 --> 18:44.482
and of course, starting in the fall, you had your 
football games, so you had your Yale practice

18:38.833 --> 18:44.482
before those. Where was Yale practice held then? 
It seemed like, to me, it was held over at the Grove.

18:49.991 --> 18:51.013
At the Grove, okay. And it wasn't at midnight, was 
it? No, midnight, there was no such thing as

18:53.440 --> 18:58.229
midnight yell practice, because it was good, 
because I wouldn't have been awake. You know,

18:58.971 --> 19:06.164
because nothing happens after 2100 worth of 
staying awake for. And so, no, and I remember, you

19:07.046 --> 19:13.879
know, I liked... all that stuff, you know, that was 
okay, you know. Alright, then do you remember

19:18.104 --> 19:22.935
going to your first home football games? Well, I 
remember going, you know, marching into all the

19:24.178 --> 19:27.987
games. And I remember the first games that were in 
September. I don't know who we were playing, but I

19:33.298 --> 19:37.882
remember we were on the east side facing the west 
side. And you stood up at all of the games. You never

19:42.127 --> 19:43.168
sat down. And I remember saying that I never was as 
tired as a player when I played nine years of Texas

19:43.208 --> 19:52.837
football. I was never as tired as a player as I was as 
a fan because of the way, you know, the focus of the

19:57.076 --> 20:02.501
game. So, you know, marching in, falling in, you 
know, with your company, all the, you know, that

20:02.561 --> 20:15.434
was kind of all hard work, you know, really. Did you 
have any dates? Yeah, Jeannie and I, my wife, we

20:17.917 --> 20:22.862
dated in high school. Okay. And so we continued to 
date, and... She had a real good friend in

20:26.860 --> 20:44.065
Navasota, so she could come up on the bus from 
Houston to Navasota and stay with her friend, and

20:26.860 --> 20:44.065
then I could go down and get her Saturday mornings 
and bring her up to the games. But I don't recall...

20:52.848 --> 20:55.992
I don't recall doing that a whole lot, but she does. 
So, I mean, we did do that. Even as a fish? I think so,

20:59.817 --> 21:01.199
yeah. I think so. Now, then after the game was over, 
what did Aggie freshmen do on a Saturday night?

21:10.011 --> 21:19.003
Well,

21:10.011 --> 21:19.003
the first couple of games, you know, we were 
restricted to the campus. And so we just, you know,

21:19.724 --> 21:22.568
went back to the barracks and And I just remember 
just kind of being in the barracks. Now, the only

21:28.970 --> 21:38.481
exception to that, and I don't know, Billy 
Provine, my roommate's older brother, was a

21:28.970 --> 21:38.481
junior in the Air Force, ROTC. And so he had a car, 
Chevrolet Impala. And Billy loved his Budweiser

21:43.628 --> 21:49.855
and would... sneak out after the games, get his 
brother's car, I guess in agreement with his

21:50.290 --> 22:08.861
brother, and this was a dry county back then, but 
Billy would drive out to a place, and I swear it was

21:50.290 --> 22:08.861
called Pop's Place, but I don't know for sure, but 
it was out towards Austin, you know, past Snook or

21:50.290 --> 22:08.861
somewhere out there, and Billy would drink 
Budweiser. Well, Billy was a good man, but, you

22:10.084 --> 22:15.673
know, he would drink too much. I was a non-drinker, 
absolute teetotaler. And so Pop would call back to

22:20.553 --> 22:27.501
the barracks, get the CQ. We didn't have phones in 
our rooms or anything. CQ would send the CQ runner,

22:29.283 --> 22:37.052
and they'd come get me, and I'd go down the hall, and 
I'd talk to the proprietor there, Pops. And this

22:38.294 --> 22:43.720
was another motivation to get my Jeep, because 
then I would... talk either talk to CQ or I would

22:44.273 --> 23:04.746
sneak out and I would go get Billy and the first time 
I'll never forget going out there to get him you

22:44.273 --> 23:04.746
know he went out in his car and I went out in my jeep or 
in a car another car and drove up there and I was

22:44.273 --> 23:04.746
trying to figure out how I was going to get both cars 
back because I knew he couldn't drive And I walked

23:05.873 --> 23:08.115
in there, and there he was at the bar. And Billy was 
just a wonderful human being, but he had drank too

23:08.155 --> 23:12.860
much. And so I said, Billy, it's time to go. Let's 
get on back. And he'd look, and he'd say, I need one

23:17.245 --> 23:19.988
more beer. And Pop says, he doesn't have any money. 
And I'd say, Billy, you don't have any money? And

23:23.512 --> 23:24.573
I'm not going to give you any money. And so Billy, 
the first night, looked at Pop, and he says, Pop, if

23:25.594 --> 23:32.421
I can bite my eyeball, can I have a beer? Pop looked 
at him and said, Billy, I don't know what the scam

23:34.409 --> 23:40.694
is, but it's worth it. So we poured him a Budweiser. 
And Billy savored this Budweiser for 15 minutes.

23:46.660 --> 23:51.364
And at the end, Pop says, OK, Billy, bite your 
eyeball. Billy pops out an artificial eye and

23:51.384 --> 23:53.966
bites it. He had had a hunting accident. He was a 
wonderful hunter. And his brother, they were dove

23:58.149 --> 24:03.454
hunting in Louisiana, had shot and shot his eye 
out. And so he had an artificial eye. And I knew he

24:05.602 --> 24:08.605
had an artificial eye, but I didn't know you could 
pop those things out. And so Billy popped it out and

24:09.386 --> 24:11.248
bit it. And then he told the story about it. And then 
Pop said, well, how did it happen and everything?

24:15.292 --> 24:18.215
And so, you know, then I say, okay, Billy, let's go. 
And Billy looks at Pop and he says, Pop, I'd like

24:19.357 --> 24:24.302
another Budweiser. And Pop says, Billy, you've 
had too many. You don't have any money, and it's

24:26.124 --> 24:27.986
time to go. And he says, if I can bite my other 
eyeball, Can I have another beer? Well, Pop knew

24:35.542 --> 24:37.085
he'd driven out there. Knew he wasn't blind. And he 
says, Billy, I have no idea what the scam is, but it

24:39.971 --> 24:43.780
is worth another Budweiser. So he pours him 
another Budweiser. Billy savors that Budweiser

24:46.398 --> 24:50.766
for 15 minutes, and then Pop says, okay, Billy, 
what's the deal? Billy takes out his false teeth,

24:50.927 --> 24:53.251
and he bites his other eyes. He'd been in a traffic 
accident, and he had both false uppers and lowers.

24:57.219 --> 24:58.581
Oh, my goodness. And so we went through college. We 
went to all the, I mean, Billy went through college

25:00.705 --> 25:05.274
with free beers doing that. And I participated in 
this ritual. 100 times in four years. And then I had

25:11.369 --> 25:14.112
to play straight faced. And it was always me 
because I was always picking Billy up at some place

25:14.313 --> 25:18.378
or the other. But I don't really remember any big 
things. Sometimes they let you have a pass to go to

25:22.003 --> 25:29.173
that movie theater in Northgate right across from 
17. There was a Saturday night campus theater. I

25:34.357 --> 25:40.065
remember we could go, we were living in 17, so 
they'd give us a pass to go over there, and I think we

25:34.357 --> 25:40.065
did that. But as soon as the grades were out, and I 
had good enough grades to have my, as soon as the

25:40.846 --> 25:47.916
game was over, I headed to the ranch. So I didn't 
spend, matter of fact, back then, there was no

25:47.936 --> 25:59.773
girls until my sophomore year, and my sophomore 
year, 64, I think it was only nine on campus. And I

26:00.378 --> 26:05.204
didn't even see one until my junior year, I think. 
And so what A&M was back then was leaving A&M. I

26:11.651 --> 26:12.793
mean, that's what you did. As a matter of fact, 
anybody that stayed around, they called them

26:12.813 --> 26:22.605
whole rats, and you worried about them. You know, 
they were depressed or... or they were getting

26:24.982 --> 26:47.264
down because what the normal Aggie did was leave 
A&M, which is a great thing about bringing the

26:24.982 --> 26:47.264
females because we lost a lot of cadets on Highway 6 
and others and car crashes that if we'd have had

26:24.982 --> 26:47.264
more activities on campus, those kids might not 
have been traveling. If you were here on all

26:49.226 --> 26:53.250
weekend, what did you do on Sunday? Well, I was a 
member of St. Luke's Methodist Church in Houston,

26:54.007 --> 27:04.236
a lifetime member, but I went to the A&M Methodist 
Church, which was right by the post office. For

27:04.917 --> 27:07.645
four years, my box number was 1207. And I'd go by the 
post office and go there to the Methodist Church.

27:11.722 --> 27:17.529
And I don't remember the minister's name, but I 
know he was a good guy, and I liked Sundays over

27:11.722 --> 27:17.529
there. I don't recall ever going to the A&M Chapel 
or anything like that. I mean, being a Methodist,

27:22.997 --> 27:27.062
that was a natural thing for me to do. Did you go on 
Sunday night? No, because Sunday night, you know,

27:29.343 --> 27:38.394
you always had your company meetings because they 
wanted to make sure everybody was back and

27:29.343 --> 27:38.394
everybody was okay. And so Sunday nights seemed to 
be taken up with getting ready for the next week. So

27:45.062 --> 27:47.185
I don't remember going to church on Sunday nights. 
Court trip. Remember any of that fall? Well, there

27:50.649 --> 27:52.030
was two. We went one to Houston, one to Fort Worth. 
And the one to Houston, I'll distinctly remember.

27:57.001 --> 28:18.553
because Captain Kieschnick, our company 
commander, right before the Eyes Right, whoever

27:57.001 --> 28:18.553
we were doing Eyes Right for, and he, you know, 
we're marching down Main Street in Houston, and I

27:57.001 --> 28:18.553
remember it was wet, you know, we're playing rice, 
of course, and... He spun around, and I was way back

28:19.715 --> 28:27.104
because I was a rear-ranked Rudy, so I didn't see 
this. I just heard about it, and I saw all the

28:27.225 --> 28:30.168
results of it. But he turned around in front of the 
guide-on bearer there to, I think, speak to the

28:30.829 --> 28:40.181
front line of seniors on something. And when he 
spun back, his spurs locked, and he fell, and we

28:40.862 --> 28:46.689
marched over him. And see... I think the first two 
ranks parted and didn't touch him, but then after

28:49.887 --> 28:57.835
that, you didn't know he was there, so he got 
marched on. And so then, you know, he was, and it was

28:58.656 --> 29:15.692
wet, and, you know, he had on his, I mean, he was a 
good-looking man, too, and a good-looking

28:58.656 --> 29:15.692
uniform, and he had to get up and run to the front, 
and so when he did the passing review, I remember

28:58.656 --> 29:15.692
seeing the pictures, because there was pictures 
taken of every passing review, and He had these

29:16.077 --> 29:25.694
muds, he had footprints all over his uniform where 
people had accidentally, because I think most of

29:16.077 --> 29:25.694
us liked Captain Kishnick. But he was marched on by 
his own company. And that's what I remember of that

29:28.920 --> 29:37.174
Corps trip was him tripping to the point that As an 
officer, I was in many a parade. And you would spin

29:41.653 --> 29:45.422
around like that to face the troops at times. And I 
was always conscious of being careful. Now, I

29:48.169 --> 29:49.392
didn't have on spurs. But I was careful that I 
didn't lock my heels and fall in front of my men,

29:50.587 --> 29:59.616
because I always felt bad for my company 
commander. On the Corps trips to Houston, were you

29:59.636 --> 30:04.240
expected to house a bunch of Aggies at your? In my 
house? Yeah, I did, too. About how many might it be?

30:07.504 --> 30:09.766
Well, I was fortunate. I lived in a big house, and my 
brother was away at college, and so we had, I don't

30:10.026 --> 30:19.075
know, I don't, There was more than one carload, 
though. A lot of guys. Eight or ten? Yes, right. And

30:24.631 --> 30:27.314
my mother enjoyed it all, and my daddy tolerated 
it. And how did Aggies behave as guests at

30:27.334 --> 30:32.541
someone's house? Well, I pretty well picked who I 
wanted, and they all knew that, that I was from a

30:39.912 --> 30:43.556
non-drinking family, so they behaved 
themselves. Because we had heard about all the

30:44.077 --> 30:54.890
drinking at court trips, and I said, guys, my 
family doesn't drink, and I don't drink, and if

30:44.077 --> 30:54.890
you're going to be in my house, you can't drink. And 
so you can't come home drunk.

31:00.116 --> 31:02.178
I said, my daddy was a football player at LSU. He was 
a boxer at LSU. And we got a six-foot brick wall, and

31:03.920 --> 31:06.443
he'll throw you over it. Now, was it normal on 
Sunday morning that they would get up and head

31:07.115 --> 31:12.203
away? Well, because I was from Houston, I had dates 
for them all after the game, and then several of

31:13.004 --> 31:25.883
them would go see their girlfriends again.
