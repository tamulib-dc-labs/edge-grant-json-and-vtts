WEBVTT

00:03.592 --> 00:16.541
that if you have a couple of dorms,

00:03.592 --> 00:16.541
the girls, you could put your girls in there, or you 
could put your girls in faculty housing, or if

00:03.592 --> 00:16.541
you're really at your worst case, put them in a 
motel somewhere. There weren't many motels.

00:17.483 --> 00:20.149
There were one couple across this highway there.

00:36.582 --> 00:43.691
It made the weekends very, very, very special 
because of the femininity. You did appreciate the

00:43.711 --> 00:45.233
femininity. And after war the new look would come 
in and I learned then that you don't have to show a

00:45.914 --> 00:59.772
lot of flesh because we walked behind these girls 
in their hips.

01:06.620 --> 01:20.323
shape, you know, broad where a girl should, well, 
broad where a broad should be broad, and this

01:06.620 --> 01:20.323
thing, this, the curves of the girls were, and the 
older, and the dressing up, and... Now, during the

01:06.620 --> 01:20.323
dance, was liquor allowed in Sabisa? No, no, no, I 
don't think so. You might have, they may have snuck

01:22.707 --> 01:24.150
it in. Yeah, and did anybody smoke inside during 
the dance? I don't think so. I don't think they did.

01:32.568 --> 01:33.228
I don't think so. I mean, I didn't smoke. What were 
Aggies smoking in those days? Campbells. I'd walk

01:38.673 --> 01:42.637
a mile for a Campbell.

01:42.677 --> 01:45.199
Hellmell, if you were trying to smoke long ones. 
Lucky Strike. Lucky Strike Green. Scalding War.

01:50.504 --> 01:51.465
World War II. Did Aggie undergraduates smoke 
pipes much? I don't remember. Cigars? I don't

01:58.111 --> 01:59.112
remember. Chew tobacco and snuff? Not much. I'm 
not saying nobody did, but I don't remember. And

02:05.231 --> 02:07.335
when they drank, where did they go to drink?

02:10.540 --> 02:11.262
They'd get bottles. Of course, you'd go up to the— 
Whiskey bottles. —the oftentimes the

02:13.405 --> 02:18.855
roadhouses, wherever you go, to Onyx, where— 
Onyx. Onyx. That's a new—where was it? It was on the

02:20.879 --> 02:24.585
north side of Bryan. you know, where the 
producer's co-op is. Just at that crossroad.

02:30.331 --> 02:30.672
Okay. Just as you look at it. Where Highway 21 is 
now. Highway 21 and then the crossroad there over

02:35.504 --> 02:38.651
in that area. There was another across the street 
there.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.864
that year, and I was trying to get some of the local 
things here. Right. Now, when the air base was in

02:54.084 --> 03:00.813
operation, there were some places for sin out 
there. Were they still going after the war? Not as I

03:03.897 --> 03:04.638
recall. Okay. Of course, the famous Uncle Ed's. 
Uncle Ed's. But I never went out there. That was

03:09.564 --> 03:10.405
beer, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they didn't 
have to get their bottles. They had bottles. They

03:15.832 --> 03:18.175
had to get them from somewhere else. And then 
Whiskey Bridge... Yeah. Going towards Snook.

03:21.164 --> 03:26.450
Yeah, and you bring your own bottle, buy a Coke, 25 
cents a Coke with a Coke smell and a custom nickel.

03:27.111 --> 03:29.654
Get ice and you mix your drink to the table. And 
jukebox music. And doing basically the Texas Two

03:33.038 --> 03:38.345
Steps and that kind of dancing out there. Had you 
and your buddies ever heard of drugs? No. Well, I'd

03:43.591 --> 03:46.415
heard of marijuana, but it was a weird thing. I 
mean, you know, marijuana. Had you ever seen

03:49.109 --> 03:51.092
anybody smoke it, though? No, no. Another 
difference is that a concert to me was a big

03:52.954 --> 04:14.123
orchestra with violins, and you're going to 
listen to Tchaikovsky and things like that, and

03:52.954 --> 04:14.123
you sit there, and you put on Best Bib and Tugger, 
and you go in there, and it's culture, high

03:52.954 --> 04:14.123
culture. A concert, if you go to a concert, as you go 
to a concert, it's high culture, not... They rock

04:19.535 --> 04:21.418
concerts that afternoon. And we had very, very, he 
went to very, very few concerts a week. I did go to

04:25.423 --> 04:27.466
one because I love Norman Rowe. He played, and 
Xavier Cougar played in Guyon Hall. Just played

04:31.652 --> 04:37.360
music, you know, when he was here for a dance on 
Sunday afternoon or something like that. And went

04:37.381 --> 04:38.462
to that. Did any notable American heroes come? 
Eisenhower came to graduation one time. Did

04:46.193 --> 04:48.917
everybody turn out?

04:55.175 --> 04:55.976
It wasn't a big deal. Did he say or do anything that 
was special to Aggies? He was a pretty low-key

05:02.466 --> 05:06.933
individual. Because I don't remember Truman ever 
coming. No, I can't. Bradley, Patton, I don't

05:11.760 --> 05:14.324
remember any of those. To me, to imagine that at one 
time Boltshaw Ballet made its home in A&M is an

05:14.344 --> 05:23.258
oxygen. A&M was the last bastion of male 
chauvinism in my era. I mean it was different and we

05:33.603 --> 05:42.297
were proud of our difference and we were not 
cultured. We didn't pretend to be cultured, but we

05:42.437 --> 05:48.587
enjoyed life and we were where we were. As far as you 
knew, after the war, in the student dorms, were

05:49.478 --> 05:57.850
there still the same kinds of pranks and jokes and 
good bull? Yeah, maybe worse. But among you

06:00.454 --> 06:02.737
veterans, that didn't occur? No, no. We had grown 
beyond that. Did you all go to silver taps, you

06:07.924 --> 06:11.289
veterans? Yeah, I think, yeah. Had it changed 
because of the experiences that some of them had

06:14.293 --> 06:18.079
had during the war? I don't think so. I went to one 
muster. It was a very low key, low thing over in

06:23.359 --> 06:29.911
front of what we called the administration 
building there. There weren't many people there.

06:32.756 --> 06:38.767
Had you and your buddies heard about the muster 
that was held on Corregidor? I was pretty alert.

06:44.508 --> 06:47.211
This is a note to the typist. I understand that one 
of the reasons for that muster being held was that

06:47.231 --> 07:13.182
the

06:47.231 --> 07:13.182
leadership on Corregidor wanted to get the word 
out about the survival of as many people as they

06:47.231 --> 07:13.182
could and therefore for these Aggies to have 
muster and to call the roll. was one way of making

07:14.545 --> 07:16.587
that known. I understand that was one of the 
reasons why they encouraged that muster.

07:25.197 --> 07:27.340
Let's talk about the student body in general.

07:30.163 --> 07:31.324
What were their attitudes? Where were they from? 
Why did Aggies pull together? Was there a

07:37.792 --> 07:40.355
similarity in the background and attitude? Yeah, 
that's right. I inferred that when I went to the

07:41.135 --> 07:44.299
Marine Corps. I was in with a whole different, 
asymmetrical

07:44.380 --> 07:52.187
group of people. I mean, thieves, filthy, I mean 
absolutely filthy talking, acting people,

07:52.247 --> 08:08.923
people talking about venereal crabs and things 
like that. I don't even know if I've heard of that

08:08.943 --> 08:12.767
kind of stuff. It just was totally different. But 
we were all kind of the same type of people. Small

08:24.107 --> 08:31.977
town,

08:24.107 --> 08:31.977
generally from the middle, I would say, middle 
class to upper middle class. So there were some

08:31.997 --> 08:34.199
people of wealth here. Not too many. Most of them 
would go to Texas.

08:41.047 --> 08:57.338
I'd like to diverge here and go and compare my 
mental image, which I shared with Richard Michael

08:41.047 --> 08:57.338
Brown, of the Texas schools at that time, 
particularly the Southwest Conference schools.

08:57.418 --> 09:03.409
SMU was the school for the children of the Bjork 
dealer and the Coca-Cola dealer. of Marshall and

09:03.895 --> 09:06.819
all the places. TCU was the school of the good old 
boys of West Texas, kind of middle-class,

09:07.720 --> 09:14.750
down-to-earth people. Texas was the 
establishment school. The movers and shakers of

09:18.495 --> 09:20.818
Texas went there. Rice was the intellectual 
school. And Aggie, Baylor was the Baptist

09:25.785 --> 09:30.932
restricted school. dancing on campus and all 
that. A&M was the other sort, the baser sort in a

09:34.995 --> 09:39.499
way. Rough and ready, not much culture in the sense 
of anything else. They're people who were

09:49.828 --> 09:54.392
intended to build Texas. Correct me if I'm wrong 
about Aggies. If the definition of conservative

09:59.117 --> 10:02.860
means change slowly. Aggies were conservative. 
Aggies were conservative. And

10:08.781 --> 10:12.786
did they... They're not against change, but 
conservative before you do it. Right. In terms of

10:17.231 --> 10:24.701
where they came from geographically, were they 
comparatively representative of pretty well the

10:17.231 --> 10:24.701
whole state? They were urban and country and small 
town? As I said, we had students from Houston,

10:32.911 --> 10:35.994
Lamar, and high school. We had students from 
Highland Park. We also had them from Woodrow

10:38.436 --> 10:43.721
Wilson in Dallas that I knew. And we had them from 
Austin High School in Houston. We had them from

10:47.684 --> 10:50.247
Thomas Jefferson. We had them from Hallowell 
Heights, which was probably one step ahead,

10:50.267 --> 10:58.214
socially, culturally, than Jefferson. But 
Rocking Ridge and Simple Catholic. Protestants

11:03.033 --> 11:05.276
and Catholics and Jewish? Protestants and 
Jewish. Yeah, and the Jews were mixed right in. I

11:09.882 --> 11:15.490
mean, many of my classmates, most active 
classmates, I discovered I didn't even think of

11:09.882 --> 11:15.490
them hardly then as Jewish. What were the keys for a 
student then to become accepted as a part of the

11:15.690 --> 11:21.378
group at A&M?

11:29.129 --> 11:31.352
Be able to roll with the punches. Do their share. Do 
their share. Flexibility.

11:39.921 --> 11:42.985
Show affection.

11:44.888 --> 11:48.714
And when I say that, to this day and age, you may 
think I mean sexuality. I don't mean that at all,

11:48.774 --> 11:55.163
but that you care somehow about your buddies. that 
you share with them.

12:06.836 --> 12:10.942
Let's talk a bit about what builds Aggie spirit. 
Why are Aggies so proud? What is it that creates

12:13.265 --> 12:15.207
that spirit? Why was there a band of brothers going 
into after Normandy when the airborne went in and

12:26.058 --> 12:28.501
suffered through that. Why does the Marine Corps 
put people through very rigorous boot camp and

12:28.521 --> 12:41.419
harass them and haze them just as bad as they do 
here? There is something in sharing of suffering

12:42.861 --> 12:52.555
that we have a shared experience of ardor, of... We 
paid a price at that time. I'm afraid they'll lose

12:59.463 --> 13:04.573
it when the price doesn't have to be paid anymore, 
though I think it lingered down. And strangely,

13:04.593 --> 13:10.745
the people I think that have it the greatest today 
are the girls at A&M. Strange that they have more

13:10.765 --> 13:16.517
adulation for the Aggie spirit than do guys do. 
Now, do these things like muster, bonfire, silver

13:17.003 --> 13:28.799
taps, final review, do all of those also add to this 
pulling together? The thing, and I regret and I

13:29.880 --> 13:41.655
hope, somehow, not on the scale, I'll be frank with 
you, I blame the administration a little bit for

13:29.880 --> 13:41.655
the bonfire catastrophe. As an Army officer, 
there would never have been such a project without

13:41.676 --> 13:46.462
a safety officer. Mm-hmm. I will guarantee you 
that there should have been a construction

13:46.754 --> 13:57.165
engineer taking off one course and put out there to 
supervise that thing. There should have been

13:58.266 --> 14:04.572
people out there to see that trunking was not 
permitted, adult human beings. The one unifying

14:06.474 --> 14:16.204
thing I see about university, and I told it at a very 
small school where the president always talked

14:06.474 --> 14:16.204
about the university not being universities, but 
megaversities. that was unifying to A&M was the

14:16.994 --> 14:26.302
ability of any student at A&M to come and share in 
this common task of building that bonfire. Now,

14:27.203 --> 14:29.125
they came after my time, I agree. But I still think 
it was a good thing. And I hate to see it go that they

14:31.968 --> 14:45.600
can't go out with supervision and cut the logs and 
do it and not be able to take a cable off without

14:31.968 --> 14:45.600
somebody knowing, as they did do. I think the 
bonfire is a very unifying thing that you could see

14:46.120 --> 14:54.793
it go up, you could participate in being, and then 
you could share, and it's burning. And I think it's

14:55.634 --> 14:56.535
very good. I get the distinct feeling, I'll be 
honest, I get the distinct feeling that the

14:58.438 --> 15:10.035
administration uses the traditions as long as for 
the benefit of the university, and the

14:58.438 --> 15:10.035
administration quite often.

15:14.268 --> 15:18.493
But when it comes to cross purposes in any way, they 
don't make any accommodation. I'm being real

15:18.513 --> 15:30.207
honest as a former student, and sometimes I feel 
like they use things that I hold very dear, if you

15:18.513 --> 15:30.207
understand. From way back when my brothers, I 
mean, standing in the Corps of Cadets as a 12, 13,

15:31.028 --> 15:40.039
14-year-old kid, I thought they got to be very, 
very, very dear to me. I got imprinted as you were.

15:50.522 --> 15:57.349
And I mean, as I said before, I knew academically I 
should go to that school over there. But I came to

15:59.090 --> 16:08.760
A&M for social and cultural reasons, assuming I 
would get a college education and believing that I

15:59.090 --> 16:08.760
could be self-taught to some degree. All right. 
You graduated in the spring of? 49, June of 49. All

16:16.237 --> 16:16.937
right. But because you had started when you did, 
what class? 48. Your class, that's right. Aggie

16:23.143 --> 16:24.344
never loses his class. That's right. All right. So 
when did you buy your ring? As soon as I could. 2750.

16:32.331 --> 16:33.572
2750. Where'd you get the money? Had you saved it? 
Well, no. I was on GI Bill. Two things happened.

16:41.796 --> 16:45.121
First, I got a GI bill, and then I had a contract, got 
$20 a month. GI bills started at $40 and then went up

16:45.141 --> 16:47.205
to $70. I started at $50 a month and then $20 for my 
contract a month. And then when the contract ran

16:53.675 --> 17:04.853
out, I was sports editor of the battalion, and my 
colleague, we have a mutual admiration society,

16:53.675 --> 17:04.853
and I will share this with you. He went in and 
bearded the Roman being to get us paid. So we

17:11.695 --> 17:17.181
started getting paid $20 a month for being our dog, 
the sports editor of the battalion. Now he admires

17:17.201 --> 17:32.858
me because our cadet colonel walked in one time, 
Bob McClure, with his boots on and all his diamonds

17:17.201 --> 17:32.858
on and everything else, very impressive looking, 
and said in the springtime that we were paying too

17:17.201 --> 17:32.858
much attention to things like track and baseball 
and things like that. We ought to write more about

17:32.918 --> 17:34.620
football. And he says, I told him, and I don't 
remember this, but he says, I said, McCrory, you go

17:34.820 --> 17:43.048
back and run the Corps, and we'll run the sports 
page at the target. Thank you. And I said, this is

17:45.610 --> 17:48.873
their time to participate. And football has a 
fall, and we'll write about it. It wouldn't have

17:51.716 --> 17:58.782
spring training or something, but this is 
baseball track season, and we're going to give

17:51.716 --> 17:58.782
them that publicity. And they have a right to it. So 
you go run the Corps, and we'll run the sports page.

18:02.646 --> 18:02.986
Thank you. Goodbye. How important was the GI Bill? 
Was that a good expenditure of federal money? Oh, I

18:09.042 --> 18:10.084
think fantastic. Fantastic.

18:14.509 --> 18:18.174
Now, you probably would have gotten your degree 
anyway, but... My parents would have. I was

18:18.554 --> 18:19.755
invited to... But a lot of others would not, would 
they? Oh, yeah, yeah. My mother and father would

18:22.679 --> 18:25.783
have paid. I didn't want to ask them for any money. I 
wanted to be independent at the time. I was invited

18:30.328 --> 18:34.273
to join Sol Ross when they reorganized... after 
the war, but for two reasons, three reasons.

18:42.683 --> 18:48.093
Number one, I had a reputation before the war of 
being a hard-drinking bunch, and I didn't want to

18:42.683 --> 18:48.093
do that. Number two, I didn't want to spend, I was 
spending a lot of time on the battalion and doing

18:48.113 --> 18:53.443
things. I didn't want to spend that time in the cell 
of Ross, whatever they did. And number three, I

18:56.995 --> 19:07.864
didn't think I could afford the uniform, though 
had I told my mother that I'd been invited to be a

18:56.995 --> 19:07.864
member of the cell of Ross, she would have sent me 
the money in a moment. The RVs. The RVs. Ross

19:09.565 --> 19:10.586
Volunteers. Ross Volunteers, yeah. When you put 
that ring on for the first time, do you remember how

19:12.928 --> 19:17.111
you felt? I'm pretty calm. Other... Have you ever 
lost it? Oh, yes. This is my second one. Where'd you

19:27.448 --> 19:28.890
lose the other one? In a moment when the Army 
disappeared, one of my wife's rings in my ring

19:28.910 --> 19:33.196
disappeared. We were moving from Dallas to 
Abilene. And no story about... No. All right. I

19:40.725 --> 19:47.013
hadn't been ever... Have you ever been someplace 
unusual where somebody spotted that that was an

19:40.725 --> 19:47.013
Aggie ring? Most unusual thing that ever happened 
in the life of that, not that particular, but I was

19:47.694 --> 19:53.181
in Paris in 19... 51 bachelor in Paris, staying at 
this small hotel. There was an English planter

19:58.217 --> 20:04.044
from Kuala Lumpur, Malaya, there. And my son says I 
was in psychedelic drug stuff. Couldn't tell him

20:08.969 --> 20:10.031
what we did. And nothing unclean, nothing I 
couldn't share with my wife or anybody else. But he

20:15.117 --> 20:17.199
told me something. That's what I heard at one 
university in the United States. And I said, yeah.

20:22.065 --> 20:22.766
He said, what's that? I thought he'd expect to say, 
Harvard or Yale or Stanford or some school called

20:24.852 --> 20:28.738
Texas A&M. You ever heard of it? Yeah, I've heard of 
it, but it was in agriculture. And you'd heard of

20:32.984 --> 20:35.627
A&M over in Malaya. But nobody ever did that. 
Regular Army, you know, the Army, it was supposed

20:40.574 --> 20:49.327
to be, pardon my wife, ring knockers.

20:50.629 --> 20:51.450
But I... One good thing, I was as confident and as 
satisfied with being a Texas Aggie as they were

20:52.730 --> 21:01.599
with being West Portland graduates. I was never 
jealous. I just read this. Paul had made some

21:04.201 --> 21:09.426
derogatory remarks the other day about the 
academy graduates. And I don't understand it. I

21:10.407 --> 21:11.508
mean, hey. I don't either. What? I don't, I mean, 
I'm, hey, I'm proud of my school. Sure. I expect

21:17.634 --> 21:19.476
them to be proud of their school. Yes. I expect 
people from Texas to be proud of it. When I went to

21:22.210 --> 21:25.914
the Marines, I was shocked that people were not 
proud of their state that they were from. Did you

21:27.335 --> 21:28.397
buy senior boots? No, for reasons. Number one, 
because my mother would have bought them for me.

21:34.443 --> 21:37.746
But I was trying to do everything on my own. I'm very 
generous, to be honest with you. But my legs were

21:39.328 --> 21:41.030
very, very big. And senior boots at that time cost 
$70. That's a lot of money. Yeah, a lot of money. I

21:49.497 --> 21:54.462
knew in normal that practice was you buy senior 
boots and then you sell them. But with my leg size I

21:55.323 --> 21:58.186
didn't think I would be able to sell them. Nobody 
would fit, they wouldn't fit anybody. And number

22:00.469 --> 22:05.594
two, you only wore them on special occasions. And 
hardly you wore them. The senior wore them in

22:07.977 --> 22:09.258
quarter shoes. I wasn't, didn't stand out for not 
having senior boots. Did anybody ever tease you

22:11.741 --> 22:15.505
about not having senior boots? So that at final 
review and things like that, those of you who

22:16.430 --> 22:24.261
didn't have senior boots just went on.

22:27.325 --> 22:32.853
We were coming out of the Depression, and people 
understood not having a lot of money. I mean, we did

22:34.035 --> 22:41.345
not live in an affluent society as we live in today, 
where people could afford a lot of things. As you

22:42.026 --> 22:46.032
were getting ready to graduate in the spring of 
1949, How did you feel about how well you were

22:47.176 --> 22:51.000
prepared for the future?

22:53.863 --> 22:54.965
I felt very well. I felt I had three options, at 
least three. Number one was the Army, which I

23:00.430 --> 23:03.073
expected to do. Number two was teaching school. I 
had a temporary certificate. And number three, I

23:06.958 --> 23:09.801
thought I could probably get a job in writing 
sports. Pretty good writer. Did any special

23:11.983 --> 23:16.508
family and friends come to commencement? when you 
graduate? No, my brother and I graduated all by

23:19.365 --> 23:21.328
ourselves. My parents were in Germany. Okay. My 
aunt didn't come, no. We were 2,500, biggest

23:26.395 --> 23:30.281
graduating class any of it ever had to that point. 
Where was the commencement held? Caulfield in the

23:31.943 --> 23:34.987
end zone at Old Horseshoe. Who was the speaker, was 
it? I don't remember. It was Anna, I wasn't sure I

23:38.192 --> 23:40.575
wanted to graduate. I had another, I thought I had 
another semester at GI Bill and Gee, I could use

23:44.956 --> 23:47.680
that somewhere, do something, you know. But then I 
thought, well, you've got to get on the cold world

23:48.922 --> 23:51.567
sometime. You might as well go ahead and die. Was 
every hand shaken and every name called? You

23:56.234 --> 23:57.456
walked across the stage. Yeah, I walked across the 
stage. See, most schools don't do that. I think

24:00.120 --> 24:05.910
that's an extremely important, good, positive 
last step. And

24:06.010 --> 24:12.160
they pronounced your name correctly and handed 
you a diploma. Yeah. My brother and I graduated at

24:12.732 --> 24:14.294
the same time. He was three years older than I. He 
dropped out and came back, dropped out and came

24:16.657 --> 24:20.743
back, and he said, boy, he must have really loved 
A&M. He entered it about four times. As you look

24:22.846 --> 24:30.376
back, what did you learn at A&M that has been 
important to you in your life? Be interested in

24:32.859 --> 24:34.321
other people. Whip out. It doesn't cost a nickel to 
reach out and say, my name's Bob Spodey. And you

24:42.888 --> 24:43.990
take out your hand. If they don't tell you your 
name, you say, can I have your name, please?

24:47.677 --> 24:48.759
Haskell? Whatever. Where are you from? What kind 
of work do you do? Be interested. Most people

24:56.312 --> 25:06.010
want to be approached and ask those things.

25:08.943 --> 25:10.165
I was an introvert. People find that hard to 
believe when I was in high school. But doing that,

25:14.052 --> 25:21.524
the Army also helped, and being a Christian 
helped. Being interested in other people helped.

25:24.910 --> 25:34.005
As I said, the only time I went to church was when I 
had a blind date, generally speaking.

25:34.475 --> 25:37.158
And I'd have to do something Sunday morning. I'd 
say, honey, not honey, I'd say, Alice, after the

25:37.218 --> 25:46.908
dance is on Friday night and Saturday night, I'd 
say, you know, what do you want to do tomorrow

25:37.218 --> 25:46.908
morning, Alice? Go to church. So I went to almost 
every church in College Junction, Catholic,

25:49.171 --> 25:56.658
Methodist, Church of Christ, all over the 
Northgate side. And there. Let me, one thing that

25:58.781 --> 26:01.984
you don't know is... getting

26:03.888 --> 26:09.835
my regular armed commission.

26:11.897 --> 26:16.462
I was my last semester, Colonel Boatner was the 
PMSNT. Hayden L. Boatner. And son, noted military

26:18.224 --> 26:21.247
historian.

26:23.790 --> 26:29.777
I got noticed or appeared before a board over at the 
YMCA building. I was, then I was finished by ROTC, I

26:30.466 --> 26:34.390
was a civilian, I was wearing civilian clothes. 
And I walked over there, got there early, I wanted

26:35.491 --> 26:40.536
to scout out the situation, get to feeling 
comfortable in it. And I expected a board, like a

26:41.076 --> 26:48.544
board of officers, people sitting behind a table, 
and me on the other side, sitting in a chair. And I

26:49.885 --> 26:58.954
got up there early, I looked around the corner, and 
here were these three officers sitting in lounge

26:49.885 --> 26:58.954
chairs, in there, and they saw me looking around 
the corner, and said, I just want to come on in. And I

27:00.318 --> 27:02.180
me handed in, I didn't report. I just thought this 
was a social conversation. It was a day after, it

27:07.746 --> 27:13.732
was a Wednesday after Truman upset Dewey in 1948. 
That was the day it was. And Colonel Olsen, our

27:17.295 --> 27:23.322
branch senior instructor, had said, when you go 
before that board, the Army's looking for people

27:17.295 --> 27:23.322
who are definite. You can say anything you want to, 
but be definite about it. And don't say, I don't

27:28.487 --> 27:29.548
know. don't be wishy-washy and I thought we were 
having this nice social and they said like Haskell

27:30.693 --> 27:59.130
how do you explain Truman defeating Truman doing 
Walter Lippman didn't know at that stage nobody

27:30.693 --> 27:59.130
knew what happened and I said I don't know what do 
you you know I'm a student in college how am I

27:30.693 --> 27:59.130
supposed to know why he won why he didn't win And 
they said, do you have a girlfriend? I said, no, I

28:04.557 --> 28:07.580
don't. They said, why not? Well, I know, and I knew 
then, but certain things you hate to articulate. I

28:16.028 --> 28:17.189
could have given them a different answer. Number 
one, I knew I wasn't ready for marriage and didn't

28:17.229 --> 28:27.278
want to date a girl and leave a girl alone when I 
didn't want to get married. And at that age, I was

28:28.253 --> 28:37.784
22, if you date a girl seriously, she's going to be 
thinking in terms of marriage anyway. And I just

28:38.785 --> 28:40.527
wasn't at that stage. You can't say that. So I said, 
I don't know. Well, they turned in a pretty

28:48.876 --> 28:54.322
unfavorable report to me over to Colonel Boatman. 
I got an auditory report to Colonel Boatman. And I

28:57.380 --> 29:02.164
dug a grave a little bit deeper with him. I went in, 
and he said, I said, you didn't really impress him

29:02.184 --> 29:09.972
with your board meeting. And I said, no, sir. And he 
said, and I went through this a little bit. I didn't

29:17.318 --> 29:19.600
go about the girlfriend or anything. Then he said,

29:19.620 --> 29:24.585
you were in the Marines. I said, yes, sir. He said, 
who was your company commander? I said, well, sir,

29:30.879 --> 29:34.742
I was in the battalion headquarters company, and 
we never saw our company commander. I know our

29:34.782 --> 29:37.945
first sergeant, I saw him in formation, but never 
saw the guy. I don't know who it was. I'd have worked

29:39.326 --> 29:40.548
with Lieutenant Kelly. And well, who was your 
battalion commander? Well, it was a Colonel Wade

29:45.312 --> 29:50.296
or a Colonel Dunn, and the S3 was a Major Wade or 
Major Dunn. And I could have been fair to him. I

29:51.598 --> 29:52.899
said, well, one of those two. He said, well, you 
weren't very alert, were you? And

29:55.801 --> 30:04.053
I said, well, sir, and I thought I'd make some 
points with this Army colonel. I dug it. I said,

30:05.836 --> 30:09.882
well, sir, I was anxious to get back in the A&M. I 
really didn't think very much of the Marines, sir.

30:13.367 --> 30:17.734
And he said, well, when I was in the Marines in World 
War I, I thought they were a pretty fine outfit. And

30:17.754 --> 30:21.960
I said, And then he said, and then he started to find 
questions. What's the range of a mortar or a

30:24.364 --> 30:25.846
scissor? You know, all the technical stuff. And I 
spit that back at him. And finally he said, well,

30:29.051 --> 30:31.694
Colonel Lawson would recommend you. I'll go ahead 
and recommend you to the Red Army Commission. So I

30:33.316 --> 30:34.338
did. I got it. But he was a bulldog. Colonel Malloy 
and Colonel Bolton.

30:43.730 --> 30:44.211
Let's see.

30:47.595 --> 30:51.120
If you were a consultant to the A&M leadership 
today, about the future of A&M, what would be the

30:52.838 --> 31:10.178
key points of the advice you would give them?

31:10.198 --> 31:11.540
That's a good question. Right off the top of my 
head,

31:13.322 --> 31:20.550
do whatever it takes. to commit.
