00:02.562 --> 00:08.867
In the fall of 37, the regular vet courses, vet anatomy and vet physiology.

00:08.887 --> 00:13.311
And where was the, describe the veterinary facilities at that time?

00:13.331 --> 00:16.174
Okay, it was principally Francis Hall and the veterinary hospital.

00:16.834 --> 00:19.216
Those were the two places we spent most of our time.

00:19.356 --> 00:21.718
Which was to the north?

00:21.738 --> 00:24.681
Francis Hall now is just right beside of the Evans Library.

00:25.361 --> 00:26.683
They built the library there.

00:26.783 --> 00:31.827
And about how many were there in your entering class?

00:32.245 --> 00:42.379
Well, I would say that our class was about 70-something graduated, so there must have been maybe a few more than that.

00:42.399 --> 00:49.728
A few of our entering, I think, maybe failed a course or so and then came out the next year.

00:51.331 --> 00:54.955
But there were about 70-something finally graduated in 1941.

00:55.116 --> 01:01.324
And about how many of those had done their first years at A&M?

01:02.958 --> 01:05.303
I would think the great majority of men.

01:05.363 --> 01:06.204
Of course, I hadn't.

01:06.325 --> 01:07.988
I was one of the few that hadn't.

01:08.529 --> 01:10.673
Now, there were also in my class some older men.

01:10.693 --> 01:16.584
I remember one had been an insurance man, insurance, so there were a few older men in my class.

01:16.605 --> 01:21.714
In fact, I think there was one fellow that said he was 35 when he graduated in 41.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.101
But they were mostly...

01:25.537 --> 01:27.059
Weren't in the Corps.

01:27.099 --> 01:31.385
They were mostly so-called special day students, special students.

01:31.405 --> 01:34.229
There were some of those students, but the majority were Corps or Corps.

01:34.249 --> 01:37.073
How were you all received into the veterinary school?

01:37.093 --> 01:39.717
Was there an opening day, a speech?

01:39.797 --> 01:40.558
Did the dean?

01:42.020 --> 01:46.847
No, I don't recall any.

01:47.068 --> 01:48.810
I don't think there was anything special.

01:49.465 --> 01:51.948
Did you all take the same courses?

01:52.108 --> 01:54.151
Yeah, we took veterinary courses.

01:54.231 --> 01:55.873
Basically, what were those first years?

01:55.893 --> 02:09.069
Well, you had veterinary anatomy and a year of veterinary anatomy, one and two, I believe, and spring semester would be veterinary two.

02:09.429 --> 02:14.916
And then you had veterinary physiology, that was your first year.

02:16.330 --> 02:20.596
Oh, God, I'd have to look at an old catalog, but I remember those two vet courses.

02:21.096 --> 02:29.047
Then I believe we had a histology, veterinary histology, but that might have been in our next year.

02:29.207 --> 02:30.269
I'm not for sure of that.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.995
And then we had some other courses.

02:35.195 --> 02:41.264
I think I had an animal husbandry course along in there too with those vet courses.

02:42.145 --> 02:44.548
And then I had organic chemistry.

02:45.727 --> 02:46.609
Yeah, I had that.

02:47.811 --> 02:53.922
I had my freshman chemistry, so the only chemistry I had to have was organic, and I remember that very distinctly.

02:54.462 --> 02:56.206
I would come out of there Monday afternoon.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.830
Chemistry really never did appeal to me much.

02:59.451 --> 03:05.883
I'd come out, and my collar would be unbuttoned, and you wanted to know a nickname of a professor.

03:06.764 --> 03:08.668
Birchard was a little short German.

03:09.048 --> 03:10.030
They called him Wee Willie.

03:10.381 --> 03:14.707
because he was short and all, and he'd give us a pop quiz every time we showed up.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.311
I don't know how I passed the course, but I finally did.

03:17.691 --> 03:27.405
I think the reason I passed it, we were distilling ether, and if you can think of any more dangerous proposition than that, I don't know, but I remember the tube going down the floor, but the ether didn't blow up.

03:27.726 --> 03:35.477
My suction, big heavy glass, an Erlenmeyer flask was up here on a burner, and something happened.

03:35.643 --> 03:38.567
of the mixture there, and it blew up.

03:38.627 --> 03:46.358
And black smoke went all over that chemistry room, and we ran to the windows to get some air, and I can still see Mr. Burchard over there.

03:46.378 --> 03:47.340
He was just tackling.

03:47.380 --> 03:47.961
He was laughing.

03:47.981 --> 03:49.543
He thought that was the greatest plan ever.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.406
And I think that's why I passed the course.

03:51.946 --> 03:54.450
But anyhow, I was starting about my color on the button.

03:54.470 --> 04:03.523
I'd come out of that on Monday afternoon after being in the lab from 1 to 4, and I'd start through the academic building, or the old main, whatever you want to call it.

04:03.908 --> 04:06.032
And there was an officer of the day there.

04:06.312 --> 04:10.260
And I wasn't purposely doing it, but I wasn't having my mind on my collar being unbuttoned.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.442
And he'd give me four rams.

04:11.702 --> 04:13.145
And that happened time after time.

04:13.205 --> 04:15.249
I guess he finally thought I was doing it on purpose.

04:15.529 --> 04:22.963
And that's the only time I ever walked the bullring on a Saturday morning was because I had my collar unbuttoned on Monday afternoon all the time.

04:23.213 --> 04:49.002
your first year in vet school did you still live over in the core dorm area oh yeah we were we were always there no matter what so you're still having the same core routine yeah in my fish year now no the no when i got into the vets the next year i was a sophomore so i wasn't a fish anymore no but you still were in the core oh yeah you still had that yeah i was in the core for three years and i didn't take advanced military because

04:48.982 --> 04:55.400
In those days, a veterinarian would automatically be a first lieutenant when he graduated.

04:55.741 --> 04:58.469
But when I got to be a senior, they quit.

04:58.830 --> 04:59.753
So I didn't.

05:00.234 --> 05:04.105
I still could have taken a commission in my senior year,

05:04.388 --> 05:08.973
This was for the war, of course, and I didn't want to go to summer camp after I graduated.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.134
So I didn't take it.

05:10.274 --> 05:15.460
So then I finished A&M without a commission.

05:16.081 --> 05:18.744
And I was married, though, when the war broke out.

05:18.784 --> 05:19.865
And you want to know where I was?

05:20.185 --> 05:21.647
We'll get to that later.

05:21.707 --> 05:21.947
OK.

05:22.227 --> 05:22.848
All right.

05:26.772 --> 05:31.257
Your veterinary, that first year in vet school,

05:32.030 --> 05:38.299
difficult in terms of the hours you were in class and lab compare that year to the previous year.

05:39.220 --> 05:41.002
How hard was that first year in vet school?

05:41.123 --> 05:45.489
Well, it was more difficult than the first freshman year.

05:45.549 --> 05:47.411
Were you in class and lab all day?

05:48.973 --> 05:51.557
Well, I don't know.

05:52.358 --> 05:57.345
We had veterinary anatomy and I didn't

05:57.646 --> 05:59.772
I didn't like it particularly the way it was taught and all.

05:59.832 --> 06:02.339
I just stuck with it and passed it.

06:02.961 --> 06:06.129
Who were some of the special teachers that you had in vet school?

06:06.149 --> 06:10.120
Well, Dr. Milliff was a

06:10.673 --> 06:14.697
I ran into him in veterinary pathology, I think.

06:15.838 --> 06:17.760
I don't know if that was my first.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.641
I don't think it was the first vet year.

06:19.661 --> 06:21.403
I believe it was the second we had veterinary.

06:21.903 --> 06:25.206
We might have had pathology, though, two semesters in that first year.

06:25.226 --> 06:25.707
I can't remember.

06:25.727 --> 06:26.708
That's Dr. John Milliff.

06:26.988 --> 06:28.109
John Milliff, right.

06:28.329 --> 06:30.091
M-I-L-L-I-F-F.

06:30.231 --> 06:30.551
Right.

06:30.972 --> 06:32.113
He was a very good teacher.

06:32.133 --> 06:33.374
Make believe I didn't know him.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.135
Describe him.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.778
He was a...

06:38.197 --> 06:45.807
tall, good-bodied man, tall and filled out.

06:46.207 --> 06:48.250
He wasn't fat, though.

06:51.174 --> 06:52.756
He was very plain-spoken.

06:53.517 --> 06:56.180
He didn't mince words.

06:57.342 --> 07:05.993
I think the first course I had under him, I got a D. I don't know why, but the next time I had him, I made a B.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.552
So, you know.

07:07.572 --> 07:08.834
Did y'all have a nickname for him?

07:11.277 --> 07:11.958
Honest John?

07:12.098 --> 07:12.699
Yeah, that's right.

07:12.980 --> 07:13.500
Honest John.

07:14.041 --> 07:18.027
But now the character that it run into later was Dr. Turk.

07:18.047 --> 07:20.591
He was the biggest character in the vet school.

07:20.671 --> 07:21.332
I don't know how many.

07:21.632 --> 07:22.794
Make believe I didn't know him.

07:23.595 --> 07:24.737
Describe Dr. R.D.

07:24.797 --> 07:25.097
Turk.

07:25.658 --> 07:27.621
Well, he was on the charter side.

07:28.722 --> 07:31.527
And, let's see, he had a little mustache, didn't he?

07:31.587 --> 07:32.828
I don't know him.

07:32.848 --> 07:33.229
And...

07:34.053 --> 07:37.859
He was a graduate of Kansas State, 33, I think.

07:38.940 --> 07:41.724
And he was famous for his stories.

07:42.606 --> 07:51.599
And he told this story about the woman.

07:53.001 --> 07:54.363
Did I tell you that about the cat?

07:55.024 --> 08:00.111
A woman, Dr. Turk got kind of well-known through the public.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.216
He made talks outside and things.

08:03.584 --> 08:08.091
So this woman didn't really know him, and she called Dr. Turk up at his office one day.

08:09.453 --> 08:14.561
Why she called him, nobody ever knows, but she said, Dr. Turk, I've got a cat up in my tree.

08:14.961 --> 08:18.246
Can you help me, I think is what she said.

08:18.266 --> 08:28.301
And Dr. Turk thought a minute, and he said, lady, he said, I've seen in my lifetime a lot of cats up in a tree, but I've never seen a cat skeleton up in a tree.

08:28.722 --> 08:30.705
So he hung up the phone.

08:31.715 --> 08:34.998
That was one of his famous stories.

08:35.018 --> 08:36.619
What was his teaching technique?

08:36.680 --> 08:37.480
Parasitology.

08:39.302 --> 08:42.245
To tell you the truth, I didn't have Dr. Turk.

08:42.365 --> 08:47.209
I had Dr. Van Volkenberg as a parasitologist.

08:47.269 --> 08:48.831
He was from Cornell, I believe.

08:48.851 --> 09:00.321
He was quite a distinguished, interesting fellow, but I wouldn't say he was fun and game like Turk.

09:00.419 --> 09:12.501
How did they try to build in each of you the philosophy of veterinary medicine, the quality, the principles?

09:13.823 --> 09:20.976
I don't recall we had any formal training along that line.

09:22.171 --> 09:45.275
We soon saw a person like Dr. Leonard in the clinic, really knew what he was doing, and Dr. Armistead taught us small animals, and so we just picked up on them, I guess, more for inspiration or what a veterinarian's all about, just from actually watching them.

09:45.455 --> 09:49.579
Did you make some special, special friends in those vet school years?

09:49.964 --> 09:50.385
Yes.

09:50.765 --> 09:54.671
In fact, I got a letter from one, Terry's over in Monroe, Louisiana.

09:55.112 --> 10:03.605
He told me some years ago here, when he was here, he finished here in 41, went to Monroe, Louisiana.

10:04.366 --> 10:08.372
There were 65 dairies over there when he went there in the summer of 41.

10:08.732 --> 10:09.914
Today, there's one dairy.

10:10.134 --> 10:11.056
Oh, my.

10:11.336 --> 10:15.002
That's kind of typical how agriculture's changed, you might say.

10:15.823 --> 10:19.228
And, yeah, Dr. Einhorn, and then, uh,

10:19.495 --> 10:21.419
I have another classmate.

10:21.439 --> 10:26.309
I haven't seen him in a few years, but he's been over here in the past.

10:26.329 --> 10:32.842
Dr. Fordson and Tommy Fordson in Louisiana.

10:34.025 --> 10:38.955
We went duck hunting one time down here when we were students on the Navisot.

10:39.492 --> 10:51.849
or we were going down to the Navisot, and so we were going down this old gravel road about, you know when you get down here at this deadly place they talk about down here on Highway 6 where Peach Creek is, there's a gravel road that goes back toward the Navisot.

10:51.869 --> 10:59.779
We walked down that gravel road, and so he wanted to get up to the tree and look for ducks, and I said, Tommy, that tree is covered with poison ivy.

10:59.839 --> 11:01.061
You don't want to climb that tree.

11:01.842 --> 11:08.651
You know that so-and-so climbed that tree, and he got poison ivy, and he went to the hospital over here with it.

11:08.671 --> 11:09.212
That's how...

11:09.614 --> 11:11.256
He learned about poison ivy.

11:11.276 --> 11:12.137
I've never forgotten that.

11:13.659 --> 11:19.247
Yeah, and then I had a classmate, Larson, from Connecticut.

11:19.287 --> 11:28.239
We roomed together two years, and unfortunately, he left here and went back to Connecticut, and then later he died sort of prematurely.

11:28.279 --> 11:35.809
His wife had written me that he had just senility.

11:35.869 --> 11:39.233
I don't know exactly the medical diagnosis, but he...

11:39.955 --> 11:48.122
He died, and I've still got a couple of classmates in Taylor, Texas, and then as far as I know, two over in Austin.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.845
Did you all study together?

11:51.585 --> 12:09.321
I want to tell you who I studied with, and he became a general in the Army, and I haven't ever seen him since we left, but his name was Castleberry, and he got to be a general because when they started this K-9 Corps, he was in the right place, and I talked to him one time on the phone years ago, but

12:09.672 --> 12:11.834
And we'd never seen each other.

12:11.854 --> 12:13.476
Now, whether he was still living or not, I don't know.

12:13.616 --> 12:15.598
Did some of y'all study together at night?

12:15.919 --> 12:18.622
Yeah, we used to study up in the old academic building at night.

12:19.002 --> 12:21.064
And that's when I'd get so burnt out.

12:21.104 --> 12:23.267
And I'd hear that train coming through.

12:23.307 --> 12:27.511
And I got to admit, many of the night I'd caught that train, except I had to face my father.

12:27.531 --> 12:29.233
And I couldn't do that, so I stayed with it.

12:30.375 --> 12:36.321
So at times you did ask yourself whether or not you were going to stay with Vef Medicine.

12:36.841 --> 12:39.351
Whether I was going to stay at A&M period, yeah.

12:39.371 --> 12:43.448
I was, I guess, a combination of weather and study and everything.

12:43.488 --> 12:45.315
Young guy, you know.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.823
It's a wonder I didn't run off and join the Marine Corps.

12:47.843 --> 12:51.811
All right, then during the summers while you were in vet school, what did you do?

12:51.971 --> 12:55.879
All right, I worked in my father's, well, biologic plant.

12:55.899 --> 12:59.386
They called it serum plant, but they didn't make serum, but it was biologic in Amarillo.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.628
I worked there two summers, yeah.

13:00.648 --> 13:03.915
And that's where I learned something about the business there.

13:03.935 --> 13:07.101
And so you decided to stay with vet medicine.

13:07.081 --> 13:11.967
Oh, yeah, I really, I guess it was just one of those things when I didn't want to leave.

13:12.087 --> 13:17.413
I never was probably serious about leaving that medicine, but when I'd hear that training, I'd think about it.

13:18.274 --> 13:20.597
If you needed advice, who did you turn to?

13:24.862 --> 13:27.285
Was there a teacher, a counselor, an advisor?

13:28.907 --> 13:34.333
Golly, I don't know really if I ever needed advice exactly.

13:34.433 --> 13:35.755
I never...

13:36.325 --> 13:39.129
There wasn't, I don't think there was much counseling in those days.

13:39.169 --> 13:42.574
You might have gone to your senior commander.

13:42.594 --> 13:48.542
You know, the Corps ran, really, the Corps ran A&M College, you might say, in those days.

13:48.562 --> 13:52.908
Like I was telling you about the Bull, the Bull couldn't do anything about it, kicked them out.

13:53.028 --> 13:54.750
We didn't, but somehow it didn't.

13:54.770 --> 13:56.072
So basically it was a...

13:56.272 --> 14:04.821
military organization, and I think in most cases, those are the boys that went over in World War II and gave a lot of jobs.

14:05.662 --> 14:14.892
Once you go to the vet school, you and your buddies, you're still in the Corps, but did y'all participate less in any of the pranks or the jokes?

14:15.312 --> 14:20.878
Were y'all more serious students than the undergraduates were?

14:21.314 --> 14:22.996
It could have been.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.338
I wouldn't say that's a possibility.

14:26.159 --> 14:36.371
We, once you're in the vet school, you sort of, of course, we're still in the core, and you had those associated, but in classrooms, you were just with other veterinary students.

14:36.391 --> 14:41.356
Mainly, of course, you'd have, you took agriculture courses, you were with some of the other fellows, yeah.

14:41.376 --> 14:45.221
All right, the football team became pretty good in those years.

14:45.321 --> 14:46.362
In 39, yeah.

14:46.422 --> 14:50.106
Describe some of those games.

14:50.508 --> 15:03.425
Well, I remember one year, let's see, SMU came down and I didn't, I had a bad cold so I couldn't go to the game and I think that was a three to nothing game.

15:03.445 --> 15:12.938
They beat them out here on Kyle Field, but I will describe a game that when my freshman year

15:13.559 --> 15:16.744
I don't think it was the first game, but we played TCU at Kyle Field.

15:17.045 --> 15:21.632
That was when the great Sammy Ball was there, and he was out on Kyle Field, and I saw him.

15:22.153 --> 15:32.850
And he'd had a little injury to his ankle, I believe, that game that day in 36, but we still, it didn't keep him from passing, but A&M,

15:33.151 --> 15:44.103
beat TCU out here, and it was the first time, I looked it up in Death Loss book, it was the first time in 14 years, either up there or here, that we beat TCU in 14 years.

15:44.665 --> 15:47.413
So that was quite a game.

15:47.579 --> 15:51.164
All right, you knew some of those great Aggie football players, didn't you?

15:51.184 --> 15:53.688
Well, I didn't know them real personally.

15:53.728 --> 15:57.314
Now, Kimbrough, there was three boys.

15:57.374 --> 16:05.806
There was John, the famous football player, then Jack played football, and Wallace was the other brother that was kind of lame.

16:05.846 --> 16:06.347
I don't know.

16:06.749 --> 16:13.538
whether Wallace, his daughter's this Fran Kimbrough here, but I don't know, she was on TV today.

16:13.899 --> 16:19.326
I called her one time not too long ago and asked if she was Wallace's daughter and she said, yeah, I knew Wallace pretty well.

16:19.386 --> 16:26.015
He was in, wasn't in our company, but I think he was in the company next to us, Wallace, and I knew him pretty well.

16:26.035 --> 16:28.639
He was county agent here for a while.

16:29.665 --> 16:34.151
Describe Jack Kimbrough as far as you knew him as a student.

16:34.852 --> 16:36.595
What kind of person was he?

16:37.436 --> 16:38.757
Really, I didn't know him that well.

16:38.777 --> 16:44.405
See, we were in the top two floors, and they were on the bottom floors of dormitory 12.

16:44.966 --> 16:50.554
And so I really didn't know him personally.

16:50.654 --> 16:52.356
But was he stuck up?

16:52.797 --> 16:53.658
No, I don't think so.

16:53.698 --> 16:54.820
I think he's very down to earth.

16:54.840 --> 16:55.200
In fact,

16:56.648 --> 16:57.611
Excuse me for interrupting.

16:57.631 --> 16:59.235
May I offer you another couple of options?

16:59.275 --> 16:59.897
No, no, no.

16:59.997 --> 17:01.822
Another one would keep me awake too long.

17:02.063 --> 17:02.464
Thank you.

17:03.888 --> 17:07.418
No, I think he was just a down-earth, and I've heard that

17:08.005 --> 17:12.512
that he wouldn't come back to A&M, I guess he did this year, did he?

17:12.873 --> 17:19.845
But before that, because he was put out about firing Coach Norton, so he's up on his right.

17:20.265 --> 17:33.287
But I'll tell you one instance, they were a motley crew, they would line up first at, see we were then in the non-military section since I didn't take advance, we were in 12 and we were on the top two floors.

17:33.267 --> 17:49.369
numbers us vet boys and the football boys would line up first and then we'd line up behind them and oh they they were a motley crew i remember they turned their campaign hat up and some of them had big safety pins around they were all but very spick and span military but there was a west pointer there

17:49.872 --> 17:53.536
They called him Soapy, and I don't know where they got that name, but it was Williams.

17:53.916 --> 18:00.163
So one night he was watching over there, and so the boys didn't think anybody was around, the football boys, so they just broke and run for Duncan Hall.

18:00.183 --> 18:02.545
See, we were going in those days to Duncan Hall.

18:03.346 --> 18:04.948
And they broke and run, and he happened to see them.

18:05.208 --> 18:08.492
So he whistled and came back, and there's his football team, everybody.

18:08.512 --> 18:13.717
He brought them all back and had them stand at attention, and then march in.

18:13.737 --> 18:18.783
As far as you all knew, the football players went to class, passed their work.

18:19.003 --> 18:19.103
Yeah.

18:19.488 --> 18:22.973
Were you all aware of any special easy courses for athletes then?

18:23.633 --> 18:24.695
No, I wasn't aware of that.

18:24.955 --> 18:25.856
I don't think there were any.

18:25.896 --> 18:26.537
I was just wondering.

18:26.697 --> 18:28.540
No, I don't know.

18:28.560 --> 18:33.006
Describe the new dorms as you students thought of them.

18:33.026 --> 18:34.528
How were they better than the old ones?

18:34.888 --> 18:36.510
Well, see, I was in Hart Hall.

18:37.512 --> 18:43.700
The only old dorm I was in in my sophomore year was Goodwin, and it was an old dorm.

18:44.381 --> 18:47.605
Compare the new dorms, the new core dorms to Goodwin.

18:48.682 --> 19:00.254
Well, a good one was the old style where your restroom was one end, maybe they had them on each end, but whenever, if you had an outbreak of diarrhea or something, then there were long lines waiting for the bathroom.

19:01.457 --> 19:03.703
Where in, like Hart Hall,

19:04.493 --> 19:13.764
my freshman roommate and I, this is just an example, we shared a toilet and a shower on the other side with two sophomores.

19:13.784 --> 19:21.393
So there were four of us that had, so that was really something where the old dormitories were just long lines if they had to go to the bathroom in an emergency room.

19:21.453 --> 19:23.576
But did you all think the new core dorms were nice?

19:24.237 --> 19:32.847
Oh yeah, the new ones were very, well of course me coming out of Hart Hall,

19:32.995 --> 19:35.579
But they, yeah, they were nice.

19:35.639 --> 19:37.361
They weren't, let me see, I'm trying to think.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.467
I can't remember.

19:41.487 --> 19:46.654
I was just in that darn one year there at number 12.

19:47.916 --> 19:50.580
I can't remember just exactly where the bathrooms were.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.365
Was it different to eat in Duncan compared to eating in Cebisa?

19:57.509 --> 20:00.133
Well, uh,

20:03.860 --> 20:05.643
Yeah, we were upperclassmen.

20:05.683 --> 20:07.666
Well, of course, I was a sophomore.

20:08.607 --> 20:18.221
Well, I was, I ate in Sabisa Hall 36 to 37, 37 to 38, 38 to 39, so I ate there three years.

20:19.143 --> 20:23.109
I can't really remember too much difference there.

20:23.129 --> 20:27.255
All right, do you remember going through Final Review the first time?

20:29.839 --> 20:31.521
Yes, let's see.

20:32.733 --> 20:33.254
Yes.

20:33.654 --> 20:37.939
What feelings went through your heart about that?

20:37.959 --> 20:40.943
Well, you mean the first time was being a freshman.

20:40.963 --> 20:42.124
Yeah, when a freshman.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.667
Oh, I don't know.

20:44.687 --> 20:47.831
I guess we're just feeling glad that school's out, probably.

20:49.493 --> 20:50.934
And it was held on the drill field.

20:50.954 --> 20:52.536
Yeah, right.

20:52.937 --> 20:56.841
Do you remember your first Silver Taps?

20:56.861 --> 20:58.043
What was Silver Taps like?

20:58.223 --> 20:59.044
Well...

20:59.750 --> 21:04.095
I remember Silver Taps, but I can't say that I really remember my first one.

21:04.476 --> 21:07.359
But was Silver Taps a significant series?

21:07.379 --> 21:07.600
Oh, yeah.

21:07.920 --> 21:08.541
Yeah, yeah.

21:08.561 --> 21:15.009
It was lights out, and you stood at attention out there in the dark.

21:16.471 --> 21:25.963
I can't remember if we all went over in front of the— I can't remember if we went over in front of the— or just stood outside the dormitory.

21:25.983 --> 21:27.124
Maybe that was where it was.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.381
whether we went to the YMC building or not.

21:30.461 --> 21:33.765
Was there ever a Silver Taps for anybody you knew well?

21:35.147 --> 21:37.610
Did you lose a buddy or anything during those years?

21:37.630 --> 21:40.954
No, I don't remember Silver Taps for anybody I knew.

21:40.974 --> 21:43.477
Do you remember going to Mustard before World War II?

21:46.121 --> 21:47.923
No, let me see, no.

21:49.024 --> 21:51.527
See, I left here in 1941 before World War II.

21:52.048 --> 21:53.550
But do you remember going to Mustard

21:53.952 --> 21:54.513
No.

21:54.533 --> 21:55.534
During those student years?

21:55.594 --> 21:56.315
No.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.599
Well, let's see, muster.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.702
April 21st, muster.

22:02.942 --> 22:03.322
Yeah.

22:03.342 --> 22:05.865
Well, see, that was April 21st.

22:05.885 --> 22:10.070
No, I don't remember that.

22:10.090 --> 22:14.755
See, I have a theory that World War II is when muster really began to be important.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.956
I think you're right there.

22:15.976 --> 22:20.561
It's after that Corregidor muster when the veterans come back and so forth.

22:20.581 --> 22:23.925
I've been to muster several times out here since I've been here.

22:24.968 --> 22:25.709
Let's see.

22:27.290 --> 22:29.032
Did you buy senior boots?

22:29.753 --> 22:32.736
No, see, because I didn't take advancements.

22:33.116 --> 22:34.658
What about when you bought your senior ring?

22:35.919 --> 22:38.362
Yeah, I bought it, and I've got it in there on the shelf.

22:38.582 --> 22:39.623
Do you remember what it cost?

22:39.904 --> 22:45.830
Yeah, I think it cost... We played an act... I think it was $25, or it could have been $35.

22:46.691 --> 22:48.392
That was money in those days.

22:48.452 --> 22:51.576
What did you... Were you proud to get it?

22:52.136 --> 22:52.897
Oh, yeah.

22:52.917 --> 22:54.739
And I wear it at a special occasion, but

22:55.023 --> 22:58.146
When I was in veterinary practice, it bothered me.

22:58.206 --> 22:59.328
I'd be taking it on also.

22:59.368 --> 23:00.369
I just got out of the habit.

23:00.729 --> 23:03.352
And it's a little tight now, but I'll have to show it to you.

23:03.372 --> 23:05.374
It's in mental condition because it doesn't work that much.

23:05.394 --> 23:11.481
Do you have any Aggie Ring stories where somebody spotted it someplace or you lost it?

23:11.501 --> 23:12.702
No, never lost it, no.

23:12.963 --> 23:15.265
I'll tell you what I did lose, and I wish I could find it.

23:15.746 --> 23:23.494
I was on the, our outfit, H Infantry, won the Intramural Rifle Championship in 19...

23:23.997 --> 23:26.104
38, and I can show it in the annular.

23:26.465 --> 23:28.553
And there's a picture of us as intramural champions.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.279
I was the only sophomore on there.

23:30.299 --> 23:34.513
But the funny thing was, somebody came through the company when we were getting ready to have

23:34.780 --> 23:39.667
the rifle championship and said, did anybody ever shoot a gun in this outfit?

23:40.107 --> 23:43.051
I said, well, I grew up shooting a rifle, and I was pretty good at 22.

23:43.552 --> 23:52.904
So I was the only sophomore on the team, and the other three were seniors, but we won it that year, and so our picture's in the 38th annual, and I can show it to you if you want to see it.

23:53.385 --> 24:00.614
And I got a little medal, and I was wearing it on a chain, and I was out on the ranch, and a branch got it, and so it's somewhere on the ranch.

24:01.055 --> 24:02.577
I got a

24:03.721 --> 24:11.312
a grandson that has a metal detector and someday I maybe will get up, I don't know if he'll ever find it.

24:13.175 --> 24:21.526
You didn't get a baccalaureate degree, so you didn't go through commencement until you graduated from the vet school?

24:21.807 --> 24:25.392
Yeah, but I should have gotten, as I was told, an animal hunter degree.

24:25.372 --> 24:29.117
At least when I got my vet degree, but I forgot, and the college didn't catch it.

24:29.177 --> 24:33.643
And you got your vet degree in May of 41?

24:34.344 --> 24:35.725
Yes.

24:36.206 --> 24:37.027
No, it was in June.

24:37.287 --> 24:38.249
We had this break.

24:38.289 --> 24:38.930
I got married.

24:40.191 --> 24:42.614
We finished school the 30th of May, which is Friday.

24:42.975 --> 24:48.422
I got married the next day, 31st, and we had this week off since we didn't have finals.

24:48.442 --> 24:49.964
Came back, I think it was the 4th of June.

24:50.064 --> 24:52.307
All right, let me back up a little.

24:52.895 --> 24:58.923
Were you and your buddies aware of the World War II starting in Europe in the fall of 1939?

24:59.103 --> 25:02.127
Yeah, but it's kind of a distant thing.

25:02.168 --> 25:08.496
We didn't think... I wasn't around anybody that I ever thought much about.

25:08.556 --> 25:10.058
It was over there and we were over here.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.301
So you didn't talk very much about it.

25:13.042 --> 25:18.650
By the time you graduated, were you all thinking more about the war might involve you?

25:20.372 --> 25:21.754
Well...

25:22.460 --> 25:30.633
No, I think this was in June of 41, and then six months for Pearl Harbor, more or less.

25:31.534 --> 25:37.624
And I think most of us just wanted to get out and get going vet medicine.

25:38.045 --> 25:49.783
And if I'd have been here in Bryan, Travis Bryan Sr., I don't know if he had anything against the vets or not, but he was driving up those single vets and drafting them.

25:50.270 --> 25:52.933
In fact, I have a friend over here in San Antonio.

25:53.294 --> 25:59.702
His dad was a doctor, by the way, and he was, see, I signed up in Amarillo, which saved me, in a way, but he was signed up here.

25:59.882 --> 26:01.023
Oh, for the draft, you mean?

26:01.063 --> 26:07.551
For the draft, and he was, as a graduate veterinarian, he carried a bedpan in the Navy for two years as a graduate veterinarian.

26:07.912 --> 26:13.999
I would have tried to have gotten that, but anyhow, to make a story, when I got out in 41,

26:14.317 --> 26:20.134
As I say, I could have still got a commission in my senior year, but I didn't want to go to summer camp after I graduated.

26:20.515 --> 26:21.437
So I didn't.

26:21.457 --> 26:22.901
So then the war broke out.

26:23.262 --> 26:28.056
That summer, my wife's just working over in the beauty shop, and she wanted to

26:28.525 --> 26:30.729
She's staying here, and I didn't have a job yet.

26:31.129 --> 26:40.606
So I went, I was going to Iowa because my, I had two second cousins that were daring and everything, and they needed a vet up there pretty bad, and I was going up there.

26:40.946 --> 26:47.918
But the guy in the head of my draft board, he was a clerk, he wasn't really, but I think he ran the draft board more or less.

26:47.938 --> 26:53.588
And he told me that if I was going into practice in Iowa, they would draft me, and I couldn't.

26:53.888 --> 26:56.250
believe it, but I tried to argue with them, it wouldn't help.

26:56.771 --> 27:04.359
So I went up there and looked at the situation over, but I didn't want to be drafted, so I came back and went to work for the city of Amarillo.

27:04.959 --> 27:17.973
So I was to, even though I was married, my wife then was up there in Amarillo, I got tired of the draft board kind of hassling me, so I decided, well, I'll just beat them in their own game, I'll volunteer.

27:18.634 --> 27:20.976
I was married, and so I went to the Army, and

27:21.648 --> 27:25.633
I said, I'm a graduate veterinarian, what would you, what could I enter in?

27:26.334 --> 27:28.537
They said, well, you'd have to go into Buck Private.

27:28.557 --> 27:31.040
I said, well, Buck Private, two years here at A&M.

27:31.360 --> 27:35.786
So I went to the Navy, and the Navy said, they'll give me pharmacist mate first class.

27:35.886 --> 27:36.587
I said, okay.

27:37.007 --> 27:40.431
And we were going to go from Amarillo to Dallas on a Sunday to sign in.

27:40.451 --> 27:43.335
This would have been in 42.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.424
On about a Wednesday, I came down with a strange disease.

27:47.505 --> 27:55.376
It turned out to be brucellosis, unlit fever, and I had all the classical symptoms, and I fought that stuff for years.

27:55.436 --> 28:01.746
Out of much weather, I went in the Navy, but then there was a 4F, and that's where I ended up.

28:02.647 --> 28:08.496
As you got ready to graduate,

28:08.881 --> 28:14.767
How well prepared did you think that the vet school had made you?

28:15.388 --> 28:18.932
How good a program was the vet school?

28:19.252 --> 28:21.554
Well, I think it was a very practical program, yes.

28:22.095 --> 28:31.085
I think graduates went out, and as far as I know, they did all right.

28:31.265 --> 28:35.209
Were you and your buddies proud to be Aggie graduates in veterinary medicine?

28:35.830 --> 28:36.551
Oh, yeah.

28:36.591 --> 28:41.078
We were proud to be through.

28:42.600 --> 28:46.406
But the Aggie part of it, what causes that pride?

28:47.488 --> 28:48.870
Well, I think it's the Corps.

28:49.231 --> 28:53.537
Now, I think if I'd have been a special student, and I have a feeling it's the same out here.

28:53.918 --> 28:56.522
If you're not in the Corps, you don't have that bonding.

28:57.042 --> 28:58.805
Now, I can be wrong, but it's my feeling.

29:00.868 --> 29:02.010
You ate with those guys.

29:02.070 --> 29:02.811
You lived with them.

29:03.152 --> 29:04.374
You saw them every day and all.

29:05.155 --> 29:05.936
I'm not talking about it.

29:05.976 --> 29:10.203
The veterinary group was your academic group.

29:10.223 --> 29:14.971
And your core group was, I think, that's where your so-called Aggie pride comes from.

29:15.111 --> 29:17.194
That's my understanding or my belief.

29:17.655 --> 29:22.122
As you look back on your veterinary professional experience,

29:23.198 --> 29:27.862
Did you come upon any vacancies, any omissions?

29:29.583 --> 29:33.066
For its era, was the veterinary program pretty well done here?

29:34.207 --> 29:41.674
Yes, but like, see, my first job, in fact, it'll come in, might as well, that's where I was in Pearl Harbor.

29:42.154 --> 29:45.697
I was married, living in Fort Worth, and I was a meat inspector on that Sunday.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.540
Of course, I wasn't working that Sunday, but that's where I was.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.463
And you learn a whole...

29:53.320 --> 29:55.042
Well, I guess maybe that's true.

29:55.062 --> 29:59.708
I haven't been in business as such, but you learn the rigmaroles of that business.

29:59.728 --> 30:05.235
But, of course, you have your basis of veterinary training to help you all along.

30:05.255 --> 30:09.681
So that was my first job was as a, what do you call a meat inspector?

30:09.741 --> 30:14.627
Now they're food safety officers is what they call them.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.449
Let me ask this question a different way.

30:18.131 --> 30:22.517
What did you learn at Texas A&M that has been important in your life?

30:23.071 --> 30:25.914
I think I learned discipline is one thing.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.916
We learned discipline.

30:27.936 --> 30:29.457
We fixed those beds just right.

30:29.537 --> 30:30.718
We saluted.

30:30.818 --> 30:31.559
We did all that.

30:32.079 --> 30:34.642
And I think military training is great.

30:35.062 --> 30:38.165
I wish I could get my grandson to a military academy.

30:38.185 --> 30:42.009
Did that have an important carryover value to a veterinarian, that discipline?

30:42.029 --> 30:42.349
Oh, yeah.

30:42.569 --> 30:43.730
Yeah, I say so.

30:44.151 --> 30:48.515
I think he has a carryover in every phase of life myself.

30:48.535 --> 30:51.778
If you were a consultant,

30:52.079 --> 30:55.383
Now, you're a hired consultant to Texas A&M today.

30:56.445 --> 31:03.294
What advice would you give A&M's leadership today about veterinary medicine and about the university in general?

31:03.494 --> 31:05.977
What would you advise them to do or not do?

31:08.360 --> 31:21.197
Well, personally, I think for a young 17, of course I was 18, boys, if possible, I'd say some military training wouldn't hurt them a bit.

31:21.217 --> 31:22.018
And I think that

31:22.589 --> 31:23.454
helps them develop.
