WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:05.559
One named Robinson, and I think the other was the name of Hammer.

00:05.699 --> 00:10.103
And it was kind of like a Laura and a Hardy lash up there.

00:10.223 --> 00:12.925
One was big and fat, and the other was real kind of skinny and small.

00:14.046 --> 00:22.934
And we had been restricted probably three weekends in a row, and it was Saturday noon that was the last formation of the weekend.

00:23.154 --> 00:27.478
Now, we ate all of our meals in the mess hall, but Saturday night and Sundays we didn't have formation.

00:27.558 --> 00:30.441
So the last formation of the week was Saturday noon.

00:30.981 --> 00:32.923
And we had Saturday classes, incidentally.

00:33.730 --> 00:34.511
So we're standing.

00:34.551 --> 00:36.134
We're out of our Saturday class.

00:36.194 --> 00:37.817
We're standing in formation.

00:37.877 --> 00:41.623
We're getting ready to move out, and we think, boy, we've got it made.

00:41.763 --> 00:43.125
We're not going to be restricted.

00:43.165 --> 00:50.057
And one of them turned around and said, well, Mr. Hammer, do you think we should restrict the freshmen?

00:50.077 --> 00:52.340
Mr. Hammer said, I don't know why not.

00:53.242 --> 00:57.088
And they looked at me, and I just blurted out, oh,

00:58.604 --> 01:01.748
crap or worse to that effect, right in their face.

01:01.768 --> 01:04.531
Well freshmen were not allowed to use profanity.

01:05.552 --> 01:10.599
So they said Fishwood Hall come to my room after lunch.

01:11.239 --> 01:14.323
So I went to their room and they handed me a bar of palm olive soap.

01:15.905 --> 01:16.666
They said, eat it.

01:17.968 --> 01:20.050
I said, I can't eat a bar of soap.

01:20.090 --> 01:20.851
They said, eat it.

01:20.931 --> 01:23.174
So I proceeded to eat a bar of soap.

01:23.695 --> 01:26.518
They would let me spit it out, I didn't have to swallow it.

01:26.735 --> 01:29.919
So I finally chewed up a bar of palm olive soap.

01:29.959 --> 01:33.623
And you know, I've never used palm olive since that time.

01:35.224 --> 01:38.508
So that was, you know, things like that went on all the time.

01:39.629 --> 01:48.659
Let's see, was this the period when President Gilchrist ordered that all the hazing and all that?

01:48.699 --> 01:50.121
That's what I was getting to.

01:50.221 --> 01:51.783
Okay, we're going to stop the hazing.

01:51.883 --> 01:54.666
Well, suddenly they,

01:54.882 --> 02:01.292
I'm in bed one night and they come in and say, okay, get up and get dressed.

02:01.452 --> 02:02.433
We've got a formation.

02:02.533 --> 02:04.316
So we went out and we got in the formation.

02:04.376 --> 02:06.820
It's middle of the night, you know, before midnight.

02:07.841 --> 02:08.482
Staying there.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.624
What are we doing?

02:09.664 --> 02:10.245
What are we doing?

02:10.445 --> 02:12.108
And we knew there'd been a lot of trouble.

02:12.148 --> 02:20.220
There'd been a lot of meetings going on and people were, you know, rumors flying and so forth.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.543
So here we are out in the formation and

02:23.317 --> 02:24.939
We said, what are we marching for?

02:24.959 --> 02:28.505
And they said, well, they're trying to do away with hazings and we're going to.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.626
That's the reason we're marching.

02:29.947 --> 02:34.053
I thought to myself, you know, that sounds like a pretty good idea to do away with hazing.

02:34.754 --> 02:43.647
And the band was lined up there and the commandant was Malloy.

02:44.168 --> 02:47.653
Colonel Malloy was the commandant and a real soldier.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.504
And boy, he came out there, and you could see fire in his eyes.

02:51.645 --> 02:56.331
He said, okay, everybody, this man, back to the barracks, or back to the darms.

02:57.213 --> 02:57.934
Nobody moved.

02:58.374 --> 02:59.035
No one moved.

03:00.517 --> 03:06.986
He said, okay, the band, turn in all your government-issued instruments.

03:07.868 --> 03:12.274
So they started staggering out towards the band arm.

03:12.811 --> 03:20.183
They put in their government issued, turned in their government issued instruments and then they came out with their own personal instruments.

03:20.623 --> 03:26.833
So we still had a band and they struck up the band and off we marched and we marched to Gilchrist House.

03:28.396 --> 03:31.260
Up on the corner there was what we called Jarge's.

03:31.461 --> 03:40.455
That was about where the Trigon is now and there's a parking lot there but that's where Jarge's was and it was a confectioner.

03:41.279 --> 03:44.864
You'd get donuts and I guess you'd get sandwiches.

03:45.044 --> 03:48.469
I don't remember eating there, but I remember eating donuts and drinking coffee there.

03:48.489 --> 03:52.555
And there was a post office in the same building and a barbershop in the same building.

03:53.336 --> 03:57.321
And on the side of the post office was this big sign, Gibbs Gotta Go.

03:58.242 --> 04:01.667
So anyway, we marched by Georgia's and we marched to the President's house.

04:03.166 --> 04:08.895
And the president comes out and all the Corps officers, seniors get up there and they resign.

04:08.955 --> 04:11.920
They turn in their buttons and their diamonds.

04:12.020 --> 04:15.305
And so we dispersed because, you know, now it's anarchy.

04:15.486 --> 04:16.387
No one's in charge.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.569
We have no officers.

04:18.310 --> 04:20.534
So we wandered back to the dorm.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.098
Next morning we got up and we wandered to the mess hall.

04:23.118 --> 04:24.981
At lunch we wandered to the mess hall.

04:25.021 --> 04:26.864
And the freshmen thought it was great.

04:26.884 --> 04:27.905
We were having a great time.

04:27.986 --> 04:30.169
No formations, no orders, nothing.

04:30.807 --> 04:41.082
And it wasn't too long after that that they kind of got things settled and some of the seniors took their rank back.

04:41.663 --> 04:45.688
They had to sign, they had something pledged they had to sign or something.

04:46.890 --> 04:50.295
So within a few days everything was back to normal.

04:51.637 --> 04:53.840
But they were real careful about the hazing.

04:53.860 --> 04:59.228
Now it still went on but they were real careful about it and if anyone ever got caught with

04:59.933 --> 05:10.696
using a board, they were out of school, and the bulls would come in and pull a check, make you drop your pants and look at your rear end.

05:12.340 --> 05:13.903
And some people got caught that way.

05:14.906 --> 05:17.892
Some people got caught, I know one fellow that got caught, and I'm not

05:18.344 --> 05:22.189
give his name because he's still prominent in certain circles.

05:23.230 --> 05:29.778
But he was, a freshman was caught carrying his laundry from the laundry, which was just across the street in the Corps area.

05:30.339 --> 05:32.722
And he said, this freshman was going over there.

05:32.742 --> 05:35.185
And he said, well, if you're going over there, how about picking up my laundry?

05:35.245 --> 05:36.787
And the freshman said, yeah, I don't mind.

05:36.807 --> 05:42.934
And sure enough, they caught this freshman with this fellow's laundry and they kicked him out of the Corps.

05:44.112 --> 05:45.453
So they were really watching.

05:45.513 --> 05:56.064
And another thing that I never really was too sure about is that in the spring semester we had a faculty advisor that would come in and meet with the freshmen.

05:56.885 --> 05:58.907
And now we had a great guy.

05:58.947 --> 06:00.148
His name was Spike White.

06:00.188 --> 06:04.572
He was in the intramural department or the PE department or something.

06:04.593 --> 06:05.153
I think he was intramural.

06:05.173 --> 06:06.034
I'm not sure what he was.

06:06.054 --> 06:08.376
But anyway, he was really a tremendous guy.

06:08.396 --> 06:09.557
And he helped out the freshmen.

06:09.598 --> 06:14.102
And, you know, he was kind of like our father during all that time.

06:14.622 --> 06:26.857
But I never really didn't know if these guys were, because we'd tell him what was going on, if they were really reporting back to the administration or if they were holding all this information in confidence.

06:27.578 --> 06:31.643
And I understand Spike White went up to Missouri and he had some kind of camp up there.

06:31.663 --> 06:33.105
And I always wanted to meet him.

06:35.088 --> 06:40.815
But I never did know if he was an administration plant or just what the situation was.

06:41.656 --> 06:46.141
I always thought if I ever see him, I'm going to ask him to see if he'll tell me that.

06:47.823 --> 06:53.028
Describe what it was like for a new freshman.

06:53.389 --> 06:58.714
What was the dining hall like and what was the ritual at your outfits table and so forth?

06:58.734 --> 07:08.285
Well, of course, you marched to every meal and you sat at the table and it was all family style and everything had its own name, you know.

07:09.746 --> 07:11.528
Shot was peas.

07:11.980 --> 07:14.003
And I don't remember what all it was.

07:14.023 --> 07:16.387
But anyway, it had names for everything.

07:16.427 --> 07:22.597
And you had to call it by name and please pass the horse feed, I think.

07:22.657 --> 07:26.262
That was lettuce and please pass the whatever.

07:26.883 --> 07:29.888
And if you didn't use the right term,

07:30.172 --> 07:31.093
No, they wouldn't pass it.

07:31.153 --> 07:31.694
They wouldn't do it.

07:31.994 --> 07:37.681
And anyway, of course, the upperclassmen got their portion first, and you got your portion.

07:38.542 --> 07:48.073
And any time there's a bowl that ran dry, one of the freshmen had to get up and go get it replaced.

07:49.315 --> 07:52.098
Now, you and your outfit were in Duncan.

07:52.118 --> 07:54.681
We were in Duncan, yeah, eating in Duncan Hall.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.765
And really, it ain't.

07:58.201 --> 07:59.282
Meals weren't too bad.

07:59.303 --> 08:06.973
I mean, you know, they'd ask us, they would ask us a lot of campusology questions and we'd have to, any time they'd ask us something, we'd have to hit a brace and do things like that.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.757
Do you remember any favorite Cush questions?

08:11.059 --> 08:19.510
Well, you know, upperclassmen would, it was primarily, primarily sophomores, you know.

08:19.871 --> 08:22.975
They would always ask you what, when a certain building was built.

08:23.496 --> 08:27.381
Well, I figured out that most buildings were built in 1933 and then I was,

08:27.715 --> 08:36.489
probably smarter than those sophomores anyway, so my answer was normally 1933, and I got away with it through my freshman year.

08:37.531 --> 08:42.358
I did know there was a few, you know, like Guyon Hall, I think, built in 1917 or something.

08:42.579 --> 08:52.735
But there were a few, the more historic building, administration building, and things like that that had dates that most people would know, but these obscure buildings, they didn't know.

08:52.755 --> 08:54.718
They just say 1933 and get away with it.

08:54.884 --> 08:59.592
Were there some guys in your outfit that had special nicknames that are very memorable?

09:00.654 --> 09:07.044
Well, I always remember Fish Pfluger from Pflugerville.

09:08.447 --> 09:11.672
And Fish Pfluger from Pflugerville disappeared.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.215
Now, that was the thing about it.

09:14.076 --> 09:17.081
If you dropped out of the Corps, you dropped out of the university.

09:17.101 --> 09:18.864
There was no such thing as going non-reg.

09:18.884 --> 09:20.487
You just dropped out of the university.

09:20.821 --> 09:24.747
And people disappeared in the night and you never knew what happened to them.

09:24.768 --> 09:29.295
And Fish Pflugger from Pflugerville was one of those that disappeared one night.

09:29.896 --> 09:30.938
Don't know what happened to him.

09:33.622 --> 09:39.552
I can't really think of any, I'll probably think of it when I get home, but I can't really think of any.

09:39.572 --> 09:41.395
We can fill those in later.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.429
unusual names.

09:43.449 --> 09:50.300
Describe going, academically, how did you select your first, how did you register that first semester?

09:50.681 --> 09:52.404
Well, you registered in Sebisa Hall.

09:52.604 --> 10:02.640
Now, see, when I, having worked in the stockyards and then become a cowboy at that time, I decided I wanted to work in stockyards when I got out of college and I wanted to be a commission buyer.

10:03.515 --> 10:08.240
not knowing that the stockyards was soon to be, you know, past history.

10:09.140 --> 10:12.384
And I was also thinking about well I might want to go to vet school.

10:12.404 --> 10:21.192
I had a cousin that, well I actually had two cousins, but at that time I had a cousin who graduated in about 1938 or something in vet school, second cousin.

10:22.073 --> 10:25.256
And everybody in the family thought it was so great that he was a vet.

10:25.476 --> 10:28.319
And I thought well I might get down there and might just want to do that.

10:28.339 --> 10:32.323
But I started out in Animal Husbandry and after a couple of years I decided that

10:32.641 --> 10:34.423
I really didn't want to do that.

10:34.443 --> 10:51.702
I needed to get in business, and I couldn't get in business without losing a lot of hours, so I went over to Ag-Eco, which was really, it was Agriculture Business Administration is what I majored in, so that way I didn't lose a whole lot of hours, and I forgot what the question was we were talking about.

10:53.143 --> 10:54.905
How did you get your classes?

10:55.065 --> 10:57.568
Oh, well, we got here, and

10:58.004 --> 11:02.149
It was the old-time system where you would go over to Cebiza Hall.

11:02.650 --> 11:05.773
They would have all these tables around the periphery.

11:06.594 --> 11:12.502
And you would, if you wanted math 101, you went to the math table and they plugged you in.

11:12.642 --> 11:16.426
And if you wanted biology something, you went over there and plugged in.

11:16.607 --> 11:20.131
Well, then suddenly you'd get down here and there wouldn't be any room.

11:20.852 --> 11:21.953
And so you'd go back.

11:22.591 --> 11:29.922
to math and change math down to this date, and then you'd go over here and put something else in there, and it was a horrible system.

11:30.343 --> 11:45.265
And it was especially bad if you were registering towards the end, see, and they'd do it alphabetically, but then it might, you know, the W's might be the first iteration next year or next semester or previous semester.

11:45.305 --> 11:50.353
So it was just catch as catch can, and of course what you try to do, ideally,

11:50.519 --> 11:51.862
You had no Saturday classes.

11:52.263 --> 11:56.411
Well, we had Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.

11:57.112 --> 12:04.768
I think I went, it was my, maybe my junior year or my senior year before I didn't have a Saturday class.

12:05.590 --> 12:09.237
But normally I had Saturday classes and the ag,

12:10.280 --> 12:20.515
At that time, you had so many labs, and I had classes all morning and labs all afternoon for at least the first two years.

12:21.056 --> 12:26.264
That first fall, did you have some memorable classes, some people you remember, some courses you remember?

12:26.444 --> 12:31.112
Well, that English, that lady English teacher certainly was memorable.

12:31.813 --> 12:37.401
But the others, I don't know, you know, they were so huge, like chemistry.

12:38.073 --> 12:42.638
That chemistry lab over there, or not lab, but that auditorium, it was full.

12:43.559 --> 12:45.121
And you'd go there and, you know.

12:45.722 --> 12:47.804
And we had seven o'clock classes.

12:48.846 --> 12:50.708
We were not getting any sleep at night.

12:52.570 --> 12:54.592
We were under stress all the time.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.955
So any chance you got, you slept.

12:57.816 --> 13:04.244
Well the best opportunity you had to sleep was in class, and especially with a seven o'clock class.

13:04.304 --> 13:07.067
And you imagine you had to get up in the morning, clean up your room.

13:07.553 --> 13:15.625
clean up your upper-classmen's room, get in the formation, go to chow, come back, make it to a 7 o'clock class.

13:15.725 --> 13:16.666
What time was Reveille?

13:17.668 --> 13:19.150
I don't know, but it was mighty early.

13:19.650 --> 13:20.772
Because I thought it would have to be.

13:20.792 --> 13:25.058
Well we had to get up before Reveille because we had to clean up our room and clean up our upper-classmen's room.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.422
So we didn't get a whole lot of sleep.

13:27.462 --> 13:31.928
So therefore, you know, chemistry was one of those classes you normally slept in.

13:33.550 --> 13:35.333
I think I had biology that year.

13:36.038 --> 13:38.402
which was, you know, I always enjoyed biology.

13:38.743 --> 13:46.917
And then you had English and you had animal husbandry, which was a lecture also, probably 200 or more in the lecture.

13:46.937 --> 13:54.651
They had us set up in sections, and these sections would have pretty similar classes.

13:55.432 --> 13:56.735
And we moved around.

13:57.175 --> 13:58.738
You know, they may have given us

13:59.647 --> 14:00.628
our freshman year.

14:00.688 --> 14:08.718
I think maybe instead of signing up our freshman year, I think they just gave us the section and already had it all laid out and everything.

14:08.758 --> 14:13.844
Because I remember I was with the same guys every class, essentially.

14:14.504 --> 14:19.931
What was it during the week on a class day take me through the whole day?

14:20.051 --> 14:21.933
What time, about what time did you get up?

14:21.993 --> 14:22.634
What did you do?

14:22.734 --> 14:23.014
When?

14:23.455 --> 14:25.497
Well, probably got up by around 5 o'clock.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.000
Anyway, it was early.

14:28.317 --> 14:31.965
to get up and get everything accomplished in order to get to class at 7 o'clock.

14:32.126 --> 14:33.729
And you had to clean up a room where?

14:34.331 --> 14:34.832
In the dorm.

14:35.012 --> 14:36.776
No, but I mean where was it from your room?

14:37.458 --> 14:38.460
It was just down the hall.

14:38.721 --> 14:42.008
I was real lucky because I had two seniors and they kind of took care of me.

14:42.469 --> 14:46.478
And I could go down there and hide out in their room, make it like I was cleaning the room up, you know.

14:47.032 --> 14:49.055
Hiding out was a big deal for freshmen.

14:49.115 --> 15:00.354
I used to be able to go across this campus without anyone seeing me because I knew the back alleys, the new buildings you could cut through, shortcuts, that sort of thing.

15:00.394 --> 15:04.821
But anyway, so not being seen was a big deal for freshmen to survive.

15:05.763 --> 15:20.538
So anyway, we're up early in the morning, off to class 7 o'clock, get back just before 12, have formation, eat, then usually you would have a lab in the afternoon and hot foot it back.

15:20.618 --> 15:23.401
I don't know how I got to all these classes really when you think about it.

15:23.441 --> 15:30.188
I had like dairy husbandry was across the tracks, animal husbandry is over in the pavilion or in the animal husbandry building.

15:31.690 --> 15:33.812
You've got English up here and then

15:34.180 --> 15:41.989
Later on, we had classes down in what they called Splinter Village, which was over around where Zachary is now, I guess.

15:42.009 --> 15:46.734
They were World War II barracks that they had moved in there.

15:46.754 --> 15:53.321
And then in the afternoon, normally what time were intramurals or drills?

15:53.861 --> 16:03.512
Well, intramurals would normally be about, oh, about 4, 4.30, 5, something like that.

16:04.066 --> 16:06.649
And then we'd have to rush to get back for chow.

16:09.452 --> 16:14.637
And we played, you know, football was one of the big ones and a lot of other sports.

16:15.158 --> 16:21.164
They had individual sports like boxing and I never did do that and some things like that.

16:25.629 --> 16:31.575
Then if you had any unscheduled time in the afternoon, what did you and your buddies do?

16:32.872 --> 16:44.499
Well, we tried to, like we'd go to the library or we'd, if we could, if we could figure out some way, we'd, a lot of times, we'd hitchhike into Bryan.

16:44.980 --> 16:48.629
And they had a bus that you could ride for 15 cents or something like that.

16:48.649 --> 16:51.235
But we'd normally hitchhike, hitchhike into Bryan, hang around

16:51.603 --> 16:55.830
meet high school girls at the ice cream parlor and that sort of thing.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.935
Did you have to have a special permit officially to be able to do that?

16:59.837 --> 17:00.918
I think you were supposed to.

17:01.239 --> 17:09.853
I know one time a senior told me to go mail a letter for him, so I went to Bryan and I was sitting there in a booth.

17:10.274 --> 17:11.937
Freshmen were not allowed to sit in booths.

17:11.997 --> 17:13.459
I was sitting in a booth with

17:13.439 --> 17:21.630
I think a couple of high school girls and this senior that I had gone to mail the letter for walked in.

17:21.670 --> 17:22.812
He said, what are you doing here?

17:22.872 --> 17:24.133
I said, I've been mailing your letter.

17:24.754 --> 17:25.715
He said, what do you mean?

17:25.936 --> 17:29.440
I said, well, I figured if I got to Brian, it would go off a day earlier.

17:30.782 --> 17:31.683
What was his reaction?

17:31.844 --> 17:32.825
Well, he just laughed.

17:33.646 --> 17:34.808
He just laughed.

17:34.828 --> 17:35.869
He knew what I was doing.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.874
But we'd try to go in the brine if we could.

17:40.555 --> 17:43.620
You mentioned the library.

17:44.962 --> 17:47.746
Where would you go in the library?

17:47.866 --> 17:49.849
Well, usually I'd go in that reading room.

17:50.109 --> 17:51.992
That big second floor reading room?

17:52.012 --> 17:56.158
Well, where they had all the magazines to go in the front door to the right.

17:56.699 --> 17:57.500
That was the reading room.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.483
I'd go in there and they had nice soft chairs.

18:00.124 --> 18:02.768
You'd get a magazine and the next thing you know you're sleeping there.

18:03.457 --> 18:11.830
And I would, a lot of time between classes that's where I would, I would go instead of going back to the, you know, you didn't want to go back to the dorm because they were waiting for you as soon as you got there.

18:11.870 --> 18:19.963
So, and that was where having a veteran buddy came in handy if you could go to his room between classes if you had some slack time.

18:21.192 --> 18:27.783
And, of course, we had to be in our room every night at, I guess, 7.30 and 7.30 to 10.30 studying.

18:28.825 --> 18:29.967
Did you all pretty well study?

18:30.488 --> 18:33.794
If we didn't sleep, I tried to study.

18:33.814 --> 18:34.835
You know, I needed to study.

18:34.855 --> 18:39.463
Boy, I was just struggling along, just holding on, you know, because I was overwhelmed with college.

18:41.126 --> 18:45.073
I thought I'd gone to a good high school, but...

18:45.475 --> 18:48.559
The standards were certainly different in college than they were in high school.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.404
And that first fall, about how often did you go home?

18:55.848 --> 18:59.533
Probably the first time I went home was Thanksgiving.

19:00.875 --> 19:01.416
It must have been.

19:02.557 --> 19:03.078
Court trip?

19:04.099 --> 19:08.505
No, it was after the, after the game down here, I guess, or the game in Texas, wherever it was.

19:08.545 --> 19:09.787
It must have been the game here.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.889
But usually it was either Fort Worth or Dallas.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.773
Well, not, oh, court trip, yeah.

19:15.867 --> 19:16.948
Let's see.

19:16.968 --> 19:20.332
I think the first core trip was in Dallas.

19:21.053 --> 19:22.855
Now I may have gone home that weekend.

19:23.756 --> 19:24.437
I can't remember.

19:24.937 --> 19:28.000
But I know I didn't get home very much my freshman year.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.263
And of course I had to hitchhike.

19:31.484 --> 19:35.949
And if you were hitchhiking, where did you catch the ride?

19:36.330 --> 19:39.293
Was it at Eastgate to go north to Fort Worth?

19:39.914 --> 19:48.248
No, the Aggie line, the best I remember, it was the East Gate going south, but I think it was over in Bryan going north.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.952
But I'm not sure about that, but that's what I think.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.697
Now where in Fort Worth then did you catch that?

19:53.737 --> 20:02.091
Well, just south of, of course, it'd be I-35 now.

20:02.071 --> 20:03.173
It wasn't very far.

20:03.193 --> 20:04.837
It was out near the Quartermaster Depot.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.781
I remember it used to pass Quartermaster Depot.

20:06.941 --> 20:08.966
I can't remember exactly where it was.

20:08.986 --> 20:10.449
Of course, that's built up, you know.

20:10.489 --> 20:14.157
Did you normally come down to Waco and then come across?

20:14.727 --> 20:16.268
Come to Waco and then across.

20:16.349 --> 20:31.804
And I tell you, I spent one of the most miserable nights of my life in Waco on New Year's, I think it was New Year's Day or I believe it was New Year's Day because we were due back the next day and hitchhiked to Waco and got there and there was a backlog of probably two or three hundred people.

20:32.644 --> 20:40.532
And of course they were sending the freshmen out for wood and we scoured that entire country for this big fire, bonfire we had.

20:41.069 --> 20:49.879
And fortunately, we had those old World War II overcoats, GI overcoats, and those were really warm.

20:50.460 --> 20:54.384
So we had those old GI overcoats on, and that kind of helped us, plus the fire.

20:55.125 --> 20:57.167
And I think it was probably 4 o'clock the next morning.

20:57.187 --> 21:02.213
But every car that came by stopped and picked somebody up going on the A&M.

21:02.593 --> 21:05.076
But that was really one of the most miserable nights of my life.

21:05.196 --> 21:08.680
What about some other hitchhiking anecdotes?

21:08.778 --> 21:10.043
Good or bad.

21:10.063 --> 21:13.356
Well, you want to tell you about a friend of mine?

21:13.777 --> 21:14.039
Sure.

21:15.103 --> 21:19.058
A friend of mine was down in South Texas and a couple of Mexican fellows picked him up.

21:19.696 --> 21:27.447
And they had a bucket of beer there, and they were drinking beer, and they told him, go ahead and have a beer.

21:27.567 --> 21:28.909
So he thought, well, I better drink it.

21:28.949 --> 21:30.011
If I don't, they're going to.

21:30.051 --> 21:35.499
So he drank one, and pretty soon they were out of beer, and he thought to himself, man, they're out of beer.

21:35.559 --> 21:36.921
And they said, oh, no sweat.

21:36.941 --> 21:37.622
So they stopped.

21:37.642 --> 21:39.144
They had some in the back.

21:39.164 --> 21:42.048
They got in the trunk and brought in some more beer in the trunk.

21:42.789 --> 21:45.433
But I hitchhiked one time from...

21:45.785 --> 21:50.209
from Fort Worth to Laredo during the summer.

21:50.229 --> 21:51.791
And I got stuck down in Dilley.

21:52.391 --> 21:55.534
And man it was hot in Dilley, Texas and that was in July.

21:55.554 --> 22:06.204
At the end of my sophomore year, and my sophomore year I really kind of cracked down on studying because I had made it through my freshman year.

22:06.305 --> 22:14.172
Sophomore year I kind of cracked down on studying and applied myself because I had the time and everything.

22:14.422 --> 22:16.264
And at the end of my

22:16.852 --> 22:22.000
No, at the end of my freshman year, I joined the Navy Reserve.

22:22.641 --> 22:26.667
And the reason I joined, because someone told me that you'd go on summer cruises every summer.

22:26.687 --> 22:29.090
So I thought, well, you know, I'll get a free cruise.

22:29.531 --> 22:38.705
I joined the Navy Reserve and I did go on a summer cruise at the end of my freshman year in the Navy Reserve on a destroyer down to Cuba and Jamaica and around.

22:39.566 --> 22:45.475
And so that was my first military service was in the Navy Reserve.

22:46.433 --> 22:53.804
And I don't remember a whole lot about my sophomore year other than, you know, we had, we were one of the few companies that had freshmen.

22:54.084 --> 22:57.830
Actually, they were transfer students, but they were freshmen the first semester.

22:59.432 --> 23:00.974
There were just a few on the campus.

23:01.034 --> 23:04.700
The rest of the people, the rest of the freshmen were all sent out to, out to the annex.

23:04.760 --> 23:09.387
Now, half of my class, half the class of 50 and 46 was at the annex.

23:09.587 --> 23:11.510
And I was in the part that was here on the campus.

23:11.931 --> 23:14.314
The next year they sent all of, and this is to get the,

23:14.294 --> 23:16.417
freshmen separated from the upperclassmen.

23:16.978 --> 23:21.064
But we did have freshmen in our company and they were transfer students.

23:21.124 --> 23:34.825
And one of them was Ivy Johanson who wound up, you know, as a distinguished alumni and a three-star general and had a couple of Guatemalans that I've kind of seen over the years in the company.

23:36.127 --> 23:43.018
And we had other people, you know, that went on to bigger and better things at the university.

23:43.235 --> 23:50.065
That freshman year, you may have been frustrated at Thanksgiving.

23:50.165 --> 23:54.612
Did you ever again think possibly about leaving A&M?

23:54.772 --> 23:55.534
I don't think I did.

23:56.836 --> 24:01.783
Except in 1948, let's see.

24:02.658 --> 24:11.259
Somewhere along the line there was some kind of military crisis in the world and I thought, well, you know, I might just get called to active duty in the Navy.

24:11.299 --> 24:12.161
That wouldn't be bad.

24:12.341 --> 24:14.366
I wouldn't have to take these final exams and everything.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.371
But that was just, you know, just thinking.

24:16.391 --> 24:18.456
But I never did think about quitting anymore.

24:18.655 --> 24:23.362
All right, when that first year or so, how did you and family communicate?

24:23.442 --> 24:25.585
Did you make many phone calls?

24:25.665 --> 24:26.626
No phone, never.

24:26.646 --> 24:29.190
I don't know that I ever made a phone call from Texas A&M.

24:29.290 --> 24:32.755
I wouldn't even know where to go, and you'd have to go to a pay phone.

24:33.136 --> 24:34.337
To whom did you write letters?

24:34.618 --> 24:37.722
I wrote to my mother and to my... And she was living where?

24:38.243 --> 24:44.612
She was living there in Fort Worth, but I was, you know, my home was really with my grandmother, and I'd write my grandmother.

24:44.845 --> 24:45.866
Did they write to you?

24:46.306 --> 24:47.868
Every once in a while, yeah.

24:48.048 --> 24:49.489
There weren't a whole lot of correspondence.

24:49.509 --> 24:50.830
Did they send you any care packages?

24:51.671 --> 24:53.252
I can't remember.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.034
You didn't get much cush through the mail?

24:55.054 --> 24:57.536
No, no, I can't say that I did.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.077
And no girlfriend at that point?

24:59.558 --> 25:08.285
Well, I had a little girlfriend when I was a freshman who was a high school senior for a while in Bryan.

25:08.325 --> 25:14.751
And then my sophomore year, I think I, let's see, I think that was the year I was going with

25:16.655 --> 25:18.138
I don't know, sophomore or junior year.

25:18.198 --> 25:23.947
I was going with a girl who lived over at the East Gate and her father was with the extension service or something.

25:24.068 --> 25:25.370
She was going to TSCW.

25:25.550 --> 25:27.874
So you weren't getting much mail through that?

25:27.894 --> 25:30.559
No, no, I didn't have a whole lot of time.

25:30.699 --> 25:30.959
All right.

25:31.941 --> 25:37.350
Your freshman year, describe what it was like on a home football Saturday.

25:37.410 --> 25:41.397
What did, what was the routine for a freshman?

25:43.300 --> 25:45.482
mainly was just the march in, you know.

25:45.602 --> 25:58.615
You know, there's a lot of activity over in the Corps area and a lot of hoo-rawing and going on and march in and go to the game and you'd have the sophomores, you know, rotting your face a lot of the times.

25:59.415 --> 26:06.502
And then when the game was over, if you won, well, of course you went out and got the yell eater and you threw him in the fish pond and had a yell practice.

26:07.263 --> 26:09.645
And we had yell practice, I think,

26:10.688 --> 26:19.516
Well, we had midnight yell practice before, and then we had a yell practice on either Tuesday, I think it was a Tuesday night over on steps of Guyon Hall.

26:20.617 --> 26:33.089
And I know one time they said we're going to cut out, cut out midnight yell practice because they were using toilet paper, Aggie Confetti, and they were using up all the toilet paper and costing the school too much money.

26:33.149 --> 26:37.573
And they tried to do away with it, but they never did.

26:38.279 --> 26:41.402
Were you involved in any good bull pranks as a fish?

26:42.063 --> 26:44.085
Well, I'm sure I was involved in a lot of them.

26:44.105 --> 26:50.092
We used to drown out our sophomores and people like that every once in a while or people in other outfits we didn't like.

26:50.132 --> 26:57.380
And then Jarvis Miller told me one time that we had drowned out a whole dorm.

26:57.740 --> 27:05.248
We had, you know, stopped up the commodes and turned all the water on or stopped up the sinks and turned all the water on.

27:05.768 --> 27:07.930
And he was telling me we had done that.

27:07.950 --> 27:12.034
And of course, we spent time down in the steam tunnels going from place to place.

27:12.154 --> 27:14.957
Yeah, when did you learn about steam tunnels?

27:14.977 --> 27:15.978
Oh, as soon as I got here.

27:16.158 --> 27:16.478
Really?

27:16.658 --> 27:16.959
Yeah.

27:16.979 --> 27:18.280
Who, do you remember who it was?

27:18.300 --> 27:19.000
I have no idea.

27:20.021 --> 27:23.024
How far did you ever travel in the steam tunnels?

27:23.044 --> 27:24.486
Well, it was just in the core area.

27:24.646 --> 27:25.066
Okay.

27:25.086 --> 27:26.147
Yeah, we stayed in the core area.

27:26.227 --> 27:32.513
What we would do, we would go in the steam tunnels and go down like over in front of the, we call them the jocks, the calved arm.

27:33.074 --> 27:34.375
And we'd pick up their...

27:34.355 --> 27:36.778
their benches and take them over to our place.

27:36.838 --> 27:40.402
Well, you know, then they'd come and steal them back and everything.

27:40.442 --> 27:48.771
And then one thing we did, and I never would do this, because I was always afraid of heights, even though I, you know, I've jumped out of airplanes and done things like that.

27:48.791 --> 27:53.917
But I was, if I get up on a building and look down, I have kind of a funny feeling.

27:55.559 --> 27:57.922
But we had the old water tower.

27:59.103 --> 28:01.746
And on top of the water tower was this big ball.

28:02.890 --> 28:07.138
Well, the object was to make sure that that ball was your color.

28:07.278 --> 28:13.289
Infantry was blue, artillery was red, the cab was yellow, and so forth.

28:14.812 --> 28:17.437
So you wanted that ball to be your color.

28:18.118 --> 28:26.974
And so you'd get like a gallon of blue paint and you would crawl up to the top of that thing and crawl up and then pour the bucket of blue paint over the ball.

28:27.578 --> 28:30.902
Well, we did that a few times, but I was one of the ones, I'm on the guard.

28:31.222 --> 28:32.884
I'll make sure no one comes.

28:34.486 --> 28:43.857
And, of course, the, you know, the bonfire was the big deal in your freshman year, building the bonfire.

28:43.897 --> 28:45.219
Nothing like that.

28:45.239 --> 28:48.603
Now, was there, this would have been in the fall of 46.

28:48.843 --> 28:49.364
Right.

28:49.984 --> 28:52.047
Was there, were there timber?

28:52.768 --> 28:55.611
Well, it was the second year that they had had a,

28:55.591 --> 28:58.155
From what I understand, the second year that had a center pole.

28:58.876 --> 29:04.385
But what we did, we just cut the trees and stacked them up teepee style like a bonfire.

29:04.485 --> 29:06.187
It was made out all of trees?

29:06.408 --> 29:07.009
Yes.

29:07.049 --> 29:09.833
Because see, before World War II, it was all trash.

29:09.953 --> 29:10.754
Yeah, yeah.

29:10.774 --> 29:12.577
About how long did you work on it?

29:12.597 --> 29:13.178
Do you remember?

29:13.934 --> 29:14.616
I don't remember.

29:14.836 --> 29:19.547
I can't even remember being out in the woods cutting, you know, but I'm sure I went out somewhere.

29:19.687 --> 29:22.333
But as far as I can tell, it was much smaller.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.356
Oh, it was much smaller.

29:23.376 --> 29:25.300
Yeah, it was one layer.

29:25.621 --> 29:26.904
And it was on the drill field.

29:26.924 --> 29:27.726
On the drill field.

29:27.766 --> 29:33.158
Now that's not the year that the Texas Longhorn tried to bomb it.

29:33.256 --> 29:36.242
Not that year, but I was down here when they did.

29:36.262 --> 29:36.682
Were you?

29:36.723 --> 29:37.304
Describe that.

29:37.444 --> 29:42.433
Well, they came over an airplane and they dropped some like Molotov cocktails.

29:42.814 --> 29:46.481
You know, it was stupid because there's no way they're going to set that bonfire on fire.

29:46.501 --> 29:47.022
But they did.

29:47.082 --> 29:49.266
They did bomb the bonfire.

29:49.306 --> 29:54.977
Now we really protected the bonfire because we thought that the people from

29:54.957 --> 30:06.035
Austin were going to come over and burn it down, and we had people out at each entrance to the university, one at the North Gate, one at the East Gate, West Gate, and so forth.

30:06.075 --> 30:19.497
And I can remember one time being over to the North Gate, and we were there, and we had radios, you know, had a radio hookup and everything, and we got a report that there was a group of tea-sippers leaving Austin.

30:20.101 --> 30:24.531
And then we'd get reports over the radio that they had gone through Bastrop.

30:24.551 --> 30:27.136
And then they were spotted in Calwell.

30:27.938 --> 30:29.943
Then they were just coming into Bryan.

30:29.983 --> 30:32.949
And so we had axes and clubs and everything.

30:32.989 --> 30:33.450
We were ready.

30:33.490 --> 30:35.214
We thought they were really coming after us.

30:35.254 --> 30:39.223
You know, we were stopping every car, entering the university, checking them out.

30:39.727 --> 30:43.170
And we kept getting these reports, these guys getting closer and closer.

30:43.230 --> 30:49.976
Well, you know, I realized later in life that there weren't any tea simpers coming over here.

30:50.036 --> 30:52.198
Somebody just on the radio pulling our leg.

30:52.258 --> 30:54.139
But boy, we ate that stuff up.

30:54.160 --> 30:58.503
We really thought they were going to try to burn down the bonfire.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.706
Then we had the outer circle of fires, and then we had an inner circle.

31:02.186 --> 31:05.429
No one under any circumstances would go in the inner circle.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.491
A few people could get in the outer circle.

31:08.312 --> 31:09.733
And we stayed on, you know.

31:10.338 --> 31:11.765
guards on Sully.

31:11.846 --> 31:15.505
We had guards all around the campus and we'd be relieved.
