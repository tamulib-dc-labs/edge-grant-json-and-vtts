WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:10.294
And

00:02.326 --> 00:10.294
after two years, Carl resigned as director. And I 
was appointed acting director. And I was acting

00:14.318 --> 00:17.461
director for the year 1950.

00:19.903 --> 00:23.527
And this opposition to my being director still 
existed, still persisted. But I had some powerful

00:25.509 --> 00:29.633
allies. many of them out here at Scripps, 
including Detlef Bronk, who was at that time

00:32.060 --> 00:48.281
president, I guess, of Johns Hopkins University 
and president of the National Academy of Sciences

00:32.060 --> 00:48.281
and president of AAAS all at the same time. And 
another one is a man named Bert Walford in the

00:49.743 --> 00:54.328
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries.

00:57.272 --> 01:01.037
Bert suggested that we have a conference on the 
future of the Scripps Institution. And we bring to

01:02.215 --> 01:04.999
this conference people from all over the world.

01:08.123 --> 01:13.411
And this was at some time, I think, in the spring of 
1950. I'm pretty sure that's when it

01:13.431 --> 01:24.326
was. Although I'm not quite sure. I'm pretty sure 
it was the spring of 1950.

01:32.303 --> 01:33.344
Maybe it was in the fall.

01:38.170 --> 01:45.399
The reason I think it was in the spring was before 
the loyalty controversy erupted.

01:45.419 --> 01:47.902
And Sproul was, of course, very much in favor of my 
being correct. Bob Sproul, president of the

01:47.922 --> 01:50.465
university. And that's why he was willing to 
sponsor this conference. And he did. And Braun

01:55.271 --> 01:56.593
came out to it. And Columbus has a letter from Woods 
Hole. a lot of guys who were good friends of mine.

02:05.563 --> 02:12.010
And we spent three or four days talking about the 
future of oceanography and the future of the

02:05.563 --> 02:12.010
Scripps Institution.

02:15.173 --> 02:25.544
And

02:15.173 --> 02:25.544
it was an inspiring affair in many ways.

02:25.564 --> 02:31.690
Later, at the end of it, we dedicated it to Thomas 
Whelan Vaughan Aquarium Museum. and Bronk made

02:32.750 --> 02:41.342
the dedication speech, and I was supposed to play a 
record that T. Willie, that Vaughn had made. He

02:42.043 --> 02:49.975
couldn't, he was too old and too ill to come out 
himself, but he made a phonograph, I mean, a

02:42.043 --> 02:49.975
recording. It was actually, I think, I'm not sure 
whether it was a tape recording or a phonograph

02:49.995 --> 02:59.448
recording, but a disc recording. And I forgot to 
play the damn thing. But anyhow, other than that,

03:04.188 --> 03:09.535
Sproul was in good form and Brock was in good form. 
That was quite clear after that that I was going to

03:09.576 --> 03:13.681
be the next director. But then we had all hell broke 
loose because the

03:14.663 --> 03:26.679
Regents, those were the days of McCarthy.

03:29.583 --> 03:30.685
The Regents passed a resolution that all faculty 
members had to sign a loyalty note saying they were

03:30.985 --> 03:35.371
not a communist. Not communist. Yeah, not a 
communist.

03:43.302 --> 03:46.387
And a lot of people at Berkeley and UCLA didn't want 
to sign that note. Not that they were communists,

03:47.328 --> 03:52.275
but they thought this was an infringement of 
academic freedom. Maybe even some of them were

03:52.295 --> 03:54.358
communists for all I know. I don't think, I don't 
think many of them were. the worst thing about it

04:02.069 --> 04:09.719
was that the regents said if you don't sign the 
oath, you get fired, you get discharged. That

04:10.861 --> 04:16.047
violated the principle of academic tenure, which 
I think is an absolutely fundamental principle in

04:10.861 --> 04:16.047
the university. So none of our guys down here 
signed the thing. Well, that's under my

04:21.074 --> 04:23.057
leadership. And we were brought into the academic 
senate councils at UCLA and Berkeley and a lot of My

04:32.039 --> 04:37.004
colleagues like Michael Bryan and the Dean of 
Engineering were on the same side. He didn't quite

04:37.704 --> 04:45.191
understand why, but if I was on it, he was going to be 
on it too.

04:45.292 --> 04:58.544
David Saxon was a very powerful, not powerful, but 
very dedicated man

04:45.292 --> 04:58.544
of fighting the regions to now become president of 
the University of California. He's the new

04:58.564 --> 04:59.565
president. He was a young assistant professor of 
physics then.

05:05.653 --> 05:08.696
And we managed to get old Howling Mad Smith on our 
side. He lived here in La Jolla. Holland M. Smith,

05:11.438 --> 05:14.261
the great Marine Corps general. He was a wonderful 
man. He was not a West Pointer, Indianapolis man.

05:20.266 --> 05:20.907
He was a lawyer. Took a law degree and then went into 
the Marines. Became a great general. But he still

05:27.713 --> 05:29.755
remembered his law. And as a lawyer, he decided 
that this was ridiculous, that this was really an

05:31.625 --> 05:42.818
infringement of academic freedom and a violation 
of tenure. So he became an ardent supporter of our

05:43.799 --> 05:49.105
side, went to see Governor Warren. I remember very 
well a couple of these little old ladies in tennis

05:50.327 --> 06:00.298
shoes with a fest La Jolla came up to him and said, 
General, why won't those professors sign a simple

06:01.477 --> 06:03.919
oath saying they're not communists.

06:06.802 --> 06:14.830
And the general turned to them in his sternest 
voice and manner and said, Madam, if somebody

06:06.802 --> 06:14.830
asked you to sign an oath saying you were not a 
whore, what would you do?

06:20.035 --> 06:27.943
And they just, that was the last time they ever 
spoke to him. And I was one of the witnesses before

06:29.337 --> 06:32.060
the alumni committee. So it was quite clear that I 
wasn't a communist, having been in the Navy for

06:33.262 --> 06:41.652
seven years and never really taken any part in 
political activity. So I was a good witness. And

06:44.275 --> 06:56.610
Don McLaughlin and Bechtel, Steve Bechtel, the 
head of the Bechtel Corporation, were members of

06:44.275 --> 06:56.610
this alumni committee and various other very 
decent citizens. and great men in California. And

07:01.380 --> 07:19.240
they proposed what was called the Alumni 
Compromise, which was that

07:01.380 --> 07:19.240
there would be a committee appointed by the 
Academic Senate to investigate all those people

07:01.380 --> 07:19.240
who had not signed the oath. And that committee 
would recommend what should be done with each

07:19.440 --> 07:28.470
individual case like nothing for example. This 
was considered by the regents at a meeting in Davis

07:31.821 --> 07:36.007
when Governor Warren was there. He was presiding. 
The governor of California is ex officio the

07:37.329 --> 07:43.599
president of the Board of Regents, not the 
chairman, but the president. But when he's there,

07:43.679 --> 07:45.121
he presides.

07:47.685 --> 07:51.571
And the regents passed this by a pretty large 
majority. This alumni compromise. I never will

07:53.334 --> 07:55.918
forget. I was sitting in the audience, of course. 
And I never will forget that occasion because

07:58.555 --> 08:16.523
Mario Giannini, the son of AP Giannini, Mario was 
then head of the Bank of America, the biggest bank

07:58.555 --> 08:16.523
in the country,

07:58.555 --> 08:16.523
said, the flags will fly in the Kremlin tonight. I 
hereby resign from this board of regents. I'm

08:22.051 --> 08:25.997
going to devote the rest of my life to organizing 
vigilantes to fight communism. He said just

08:26.382 --> 08:31.708
exactly those words, believe it or not. That gives 
you some idea of the spirit of that awful time.

08:36.553 --> 08:38.695
Well, you know, in Texas, we had to sign it by law. It 
was passed by state law. Any state employee had to

08:41.138 --> 08:43.561
sign the Loyalty Act, as I remember. Well, if you 
have to do it by law, you've got to do it. The Regents

08:45.903 --> 08:50.028
didn't have that legal authority. We said we would 
sign it.

08:55.323 --> 08:56.605
We would obey the law. We wouldn't sign something 
that was imposed by the regents. And Governor

09:01.632 --> 09:07.319
Warren said, Mario, you don't want to do that. The 
Democratic thing to do is for you to stay here and

09:07.339 --> 09:10.784
try to convince us we're wrong. Don't resign from 
the board. Stay on the board and try to persuade us

09:13.988 --> 09:17.453
to change our mind.

09:20.317 --> 09:22.039
Gene, nevertheless, he did resign. And I took an 
oath that I would vote for Governor Warren from

09:22.424 --> 09:27.051
then on, no matter what he ran for. Unfortunately, 
he never ran for anything again. A few weeks later,

09:28.673 --> 09:36.244
he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court.

09:36.264 --> 09:39.629
That was a 19, well, not a few weeks later, a couple 
of years later, actually. This was in 1950. And

09:42.053 --> 09:44.196
then we, then Russ Rade and I,

09:52.934 --> 09:55.798
I guess not many other members of the faculty. We 
went out on our mid-Pacific expedition in the

09:55.858 --> 10:00.966
summer of 1950. That was a two-ship expedition. 
That was the first great exploring expedition of

10:05.052 --> 10:09.659
the Scripps Institution in 1950. We went out. One 
of the things we discovered was the mid-Pacific

10:11.722 --> 10:13.985
mountains. That's where the mountain range runs 
west of Hawaii. Another was we measured the heat

10:17.230 --> 10:21.777
flow coming through the sea floor. found that 
about the same as the continental heat flow. Rust

10:27.281 --> 10:31.926
rate made a lot of seismic measurements, which 
showed that the sediments were only about 100

10:27.281 --> 10:31.926
meters thick. This was the beginning, really, of 
the great series of discoveries that had ended up

10:34.469 --> 10:43.037
in plate tectonics.

10:46.181 --> 10:49.584
These seamounts, 6,000 people at the surface. 
Laptop, all been at the surface. very young, not

10:53.887 --> 10:55.129
old. There was no place in the ocean that was very 
old. It was thought that they were perhaps two

11:01.198 --> 11:04.402
billion years old, because they were so deep. Very 
thin sediments, which tied in exactly with the

11:06.966 --> 11:12.133
idea that the sea floor was very young. The heat 
flow, which couldn't be explained in any other way

11:12.173 --> 11:17.481
except by convection and

11:22.186 --> 11:37.923
And later, of course, later expeditions we looked 
at the trenches and

11:22.186 --> 11:37.923
the mid-ocean ridges, particularly the magnetic 
striping,

11:22.186 --> 11:37.923
which is another story. Well, how much longer do 
you want to go

11:38.844 --> 11:46.573
with that? Starting with the Mid-Pac Expedition 
in 1950, we organized more and more exploring

11:48.882 --> 12:01.112
expeditions over larger and larger areas of the 
Pacific. These were led by a series of inspired

12:01.833 --> 12:04.796
expedition leaders. I led the Mid-Pacific 
Expedition and what we call the Capricorn

12:05.736 --> 12:10.861
Expedition. But most of the expeditions were led 
by Warren Wooster and by Bill Menard, by Bob

12:11.822 --> 12:18.147
Fisher,

12:22.447 --> 12:22.947
One was . Those

12:23.388 --> 12:41.104
are the three that occurred to me offhand as the 
people who really were very good at this. And we

12:41.124 --> 12:44.927
gradually built up our fleet of ships. And we had 
more and more kinds of expeditions. For example,

12:47.829 --> 12:50.732
we had one in the South China Sea that lasted maybe 
three years, South China Sea and the Gulf of

12:51.590 --> 12:55.034
Thailand. She called it the Naga expedition. The 
leader of that started out to be a Dane named Anton

12:58.217 --> 13:14.254
Brun, but he got sick, got immediate dysentery, 
and was taken over by the captain, Jim Moore, also

12:58.217 --> 13:14.254
an inspiring leader.

13:14.274 --> 13:16.737
He's a very special kind of guy. Morris Ewing was 
very good at it. Different people do it in

13:21.188 --> 13:34.721
different ways, but

13:21.188 --> 13:34.721
the essential thing is to make everybody feel that 
he's getting his share of the pie. All the people on

13:34.842 --> 13:42.929
board are doing something that advances their own 
research interests.

13:45.572 --> 13:50.537
And that you have adequate equipment, adequate 
crewing and personnel. competent personnel,

13:51.142 --> 13:58.831
complicated planning and logistics as well as 
operational business. Another man very good at

13:58.851 --> 14:01.174
this was Johnny Knauss. In fact, we sort of 
specialize in producing oceanographic

14:02.696 --> 14:06.260
administrators at Scripps. Most of the 
oceanographic institutions in this country are

14:07.322 --> 14:14.350
led by Scripps graduates, or partially led. For 
example, Art Maxwell at Woods Hole, Johnny Knauss

14:14.370 --> 14:19.917
at Rhode Island. Warren Wooster just retired from 
the Rosenstiel Laboratory at the University of

14:20.926 --> 14:31.100
Miami, Dick Fleming in Seattle, Dale Lieber in 
Texas A&M.

14:36.828 --> 14:41.755
Anyhow, they had good training with being a 
director of an institution to lead some

14:36.828 --> 14:41.755
expeditions. And I was pretty good at that. I was 
never much of an administrator, sure, but I was a

14:44.399 --> 14:48.925
good administrator at sea. Anyhow,

14:51.014 --> 15:01.947
about 1955, I never went to sea anymore.

15:05.171 --> 15:15.364
One of the reasons for this was that I decided that 
we were not treating our graduate students very

15:05.171 --> 15:15.364
well. I felt two things, and I always have felt. one 
of them, and that is that research and teaching are

15:21.018 --> 15:24.323
inseparable. That you just can't do a good job of 
teaching without research, and you can't do a good

15:26.005 --> 15:32.614
job of research without teaching. And if you look 
at laboratories that are divorced from

15:34.056 --> 15:42.648
universities, they never last for more than, 
they're never very good for more than a

15:34.056 --> 15:42.648
generation. They don't reproduce themselves. 
You need to have young people, and you need to have

15:47.434 --> 15:50.839
the the enthusiasm, the energy, the iconoclasm, 
and the

15:51.578 --> 16:02.736
confidence that young people, young scientists 
have. And so it was quite essential from my point of

16:04.680 --> 16:12.753
view that we should have good graduate students 
here at Scripps. But guys like Art Maxwell and

16:12.773 --> 16:18.362
Johnny Knauss and some of the others, had a hard 
time with their doctoral exams. And I thought the

16:25.137 --> 16:29.862
reason for it was a lot of them did. Not just those 
two, but those were two outstanding people who had

16:30.422 --> 16:36.768
trouble with their doctoral exams. I thought the 
reason for it was that they were divorced from the

16:36.788 --> 16:39.871
basic sciences. We were 120 miles away from UCLA. 
It was a killing trip to get up there. The people who

16:47.859 --> 16:49.260
came down here tended to stay here and not to take 
any more courses in physics or chemistry or

16:49.814 --> 17:08.362
biology or mathematics or engineering, which are 
basic to oceanographic research or

16:49.814 --> 17:08.362
oceanographic work. Oceanography is not really a 
science. Oceanography is the application of

17:11.287 --> 17:19.399
science to an object of study, namely the ocean, 
and what lives in the ocean, what's beneath the

17:11.287 --> 17:19.399
ocean, what's above the ocean. whole range of 
phenomena of the watery part of our planet. And

17:25.271 --> 17:38.992
therefore what you need is good physicists and 
good chemists and good biologists, who at the same

17:25.271 --> 17:38.992
time are fascinated by this complex set of 
phenomena that occur in the ocean. And I think you

17:40.434 --> 17:47.665
need people who are, you need at least some of these 
people to be trained in oceanographic

17:40.434 --> 17:47.665
institutions. as graduate students. The reason I 
do is that

17:51.401 --> 17:59.150
going to sea is more than just an art. Doing science 
at sea, there's an artistic component to it. But it

18:05.017 --> 18:10.963
also takes a certain kind of scientific 
imagination and scientific planning. And even

18:13.266 --> 18:14.968
more important, Every part of the ocean is related 
to every other part of the ocean. You can't do

18:19.828 --> 18:25.753
marine physics very well without also knowing 
something about marine chemistry and marine

18:19.828 --> 18:25.753
biology. The story I told you about the snapping 
shrimp and the deep scattering layer illustrates

18:25.773 --> 18:32.219
that very well indeed. You need to have respect for 
and understanding of, if you're a physical

18:33.800 --> 18:42.749
oceanographer, what the biologists know and what 
they're interested in, and vice versa. So that

18:43.750 --> 18:45.411
means that you really need Some people to be 
trained in an oceanographic institution will

18:46.555 --> 18:52.804
have this breadth of view and special kind of 
experience. On the other hand, they also need to

18:54.086 --> 18:59.054
know as much basic science as possible. It's a 
tough business to do both those things. And it's

19:02.619 --> 19:08.207
essentially impossible if the nearest 
university, basic university, is 120 miles away.

19:09.409 --> 19:14.757
Woods Hole has discovered the same thing.

19:17.251 --> 19:30.653
I thought of a way to solve this problem, which was 
to establish down here a graduate school of

19:17.251 --> 19:30.653
science and engineering,

19:17.251 --> 19:30.653
which I thought of as like Caltech. If you look at 
Caltech, it's got mostly graduate students. It's

19:35.180 --> 19:42.111
only got 500 undergraduates and about 1,500 
graduate students.

19:42.563 --> 19:47.970
The only difference would be that this would be a 
state-supported institution rather than a

19:42.563 --> 19:47.970
privately-supported institution. But in those 
days, that difference didn't look like it was very

19:47.990 --> 19:54.819
much of a difference, because everybody was 
riding high. Prosperity was not only around the

19:56.021 --> 19:59.666
corner, it was here with a bang for the bang. And the 
taxes income of the University of California was

20:00.867 --> 20:12.182
increasing by leaps and bounds, even though 
everybody always poor-mouthed it.

20:12.668 --> 20:21.082
I got a good deal of support from the Chamber of 
Commerce and the industrial, the conveyor and the

20:12.668 --> 20:21.082
other industrial people in San Diego. And I 
brought Rosson Bennett out here, the man I told you

20:23.386 --> 20:28.114
about before. By this time he was chief of Naval 
Research, head of the Office of Naval Research.

20:34.124 --> 20:34.965
And he made a speech. He had been here before. He was 
well known in San Diego because he'd been His last

20:38.892 --> 20:52.705
job before becoming chief of the Bureau of Naval 
Research was he was commander of the Naval

20:38.892 --> 20:52.705
Electronics Laboratory, director of the Naval 
Electronics Laboratory, which was the old Navy

20:38.892 --> 20:52.705
radio and sound laboratory. That's a big job. He 
was well known. He came out and gave a speech to

20:57.769 --> 21:06.537
local citizens, including the city manager and 
the mayor and the bigwigs of San Diego. and said

21:07.883 --> 21:18.498
that the Navy was all for this, and would support it 
vigorously, and would support research there,

21:07.883 --> 21:18.498
and also said it was a damn good thing for San Diego, 
which he knew well. And it was a very powerful and

21:19.820 --> 21:23.766
very effective speech. And the people of San Diego 
wanted this anyhow, so this was just an added

21:24.447 --> 21:32.899
bonus. But the main thing that Rawson did was to 
overcome the opposition of other campuses of the

21:37.955 --> 21:43.302
university, particularly UCLA. It was always 
very jealous of us because we never did much

21:44.764 --> 21:58.122
teaching and we got lots of money from the 
government and lots of members of the National

21:44.764 --> 21:58.122
Academy and things like that. Not many by that 
time, but still several at that time. Several.

22:03.168 --> 22:04.350
More than they had at UCLA. And the worst blow of all 
to the UCLA people was when we persuaded Harold

22:05.596 --> 22:13.023
Urey to come out here. I'd gotten to know Harold 
pretty well in

22:15.305 --> 22:34.742
Washington in

22:15.305 --> 22:34.742
connection with my interest in geochemistry.

22:36.882 --> 22:59.604
I went to see him and persuaded him to come, to get to 
the Scripps Institution, having in mind,

22:36.882 --> 22:59.604
however, that we would have this School of Science 
and Engineering about the same time Jim Arnold

22:36.882 --> 22:59.604
came here, and him, Craig, and Hans Seuss, who were 
very, particularly Hans Seuss was a great

22:36.882 --> 22:59.604
scientist, recognized as one. I guess they came 
first, and then Harold. Anyhow, you guys at UCLA

23:04.507 --> 23:07.972
took a very dim view of our getting Urey. And they 
insisted to Sproul that he not be a professor at

23:08.934 --> 23:16.144
Scripps, but a professor at large in the 
university. So if they could claim two,

23:16.164 --> 23:23.816
particularly a man named Louis Slichter, who was 
director of the Institute of Geophysics, felt

23:16.164 --> 23:23.816
this way. Because he said, if I hadn't talked 
Harold into coming here, he would have come to

23:23.836 --> 23:28.543
UCLA. He might or might not. Anyhow, there were a 
series of committees from the other campuses that

23:34.662 --> 23:44.333
took a very dim view of this school of science and 
engineering.

23:45.594 --> 23:49.358
The engineers said that we can do the whole job for 
the university extension. One of the reasons for

23:50.380 --> 24:01.412
having it was to upgrade the quality of the 
engineers and scientists that were working for

23:50.380 --> 24:01.412
Aurora and Solar and Convair and the other high 
technology industries here.

24:04.666 --> 24:12.457
And they had, the School of Engineering at UCLA had 
a program down here which was designed to do this.

24:13.980 --> 24:16.904
And they said, why can't we just expand that? But 
Glenn Seaborg came down on one of these

24:16.924 --> 24:22.552
committees, and Ernest Lawrence was on that 
committee, too. And they were from Berkeley,

24:23.634 --> 24:28.241
which is far enough away so we weren't a threat. And 
they always liked big ideas. So they

24:31.005 --> 24:32.547
enthusiastically backed it. And the result was 
that the regents voted to establish it. This was

24:42.319 --> 24:44.222
about 1956 or 57. And

24:44.262 --> 24:57.462
the city of San Diego voted to give the university 
high-speed

24:44.262 --> 24:57.462
art. I'm a little bit confused about the actual 
detailed sequence of events. The upshot or the

25:04.471 --> 25:19.934
fact was that the School of Science and 
Engineering never got off the ground,

25:04.471 --> 25:19.934
even though the city had voted this as 50 acres of 
land. And the reason was that the regents got a

25:21.697 --> 25:24.161
bigger idea. There was a state office of education 
report

25:49.122 --> 25:53.587
based upon demographic projections of the future 
of California. They said we were going to have 50

25:55.670 --> 25:58.894
million people here by the year 2000. Those were 
the days when the birth rate was right in the middle

26:00.916 --> 26:03.940
of the baby boom. Birth rate was still going up. And 
people were flocking into California because of

26:07.784 --> 26:13.611
the rise of high technology industry here.

26:17.945 --> 26:32.031
And all the projections showed the population of 
California just going up and up to 50 million

26:17.945 --> 26:32.031
people by the end of the century.

26:32.051 --> 26:34.435
So they decided, and it was recommended,

26:44.742 --> 26:51.910
All three segments of public higher education in 
California should be expanded. Those were the

26:52.951 --> 27:12.133
junior colleges, which were locally paid for and 
locally managed by cities out of the city taxes,

26:52.951 --> 27:12.133
like public schools, but with a contribution from 
the state colleges, which

27:18.577 --> 27:24.766
offered a full four-year college education to a 
rather large percentage of high school

27:18.577 --> 27:24.766
graduates.

27:28.512 --> 27:40.871
And the university, which offered not only 
undergraduate but also graduate education and

27:28.512 --> 27:40.871
research, and had a very restrictive admissions 
policy, only the top one-eighth of the high school

27:28.512 --> 27:40.871
graduates.

27:45.477 --> 27:47.841
And this admissions policy was formalized by the 
Coordinating Board of Higher Education of

27:49.340 --> 28:17.136
California, composed of four segments, three 
public segments plus a private

27:49.340 --> 28:17.136
college, that the uni colleges would admit every 
high school graduate, state colleges would admit

27:49.340 --> 28:17.136
the top 35%, and the University of California the 
top 12.5%

27:49.340 --> 28:17.136
as freshmen, and that they would also The 
university would also have met graduates of the

28:17.858 --> 28:27.069
junior colleges who were qualified.

28:27.090 --> 28:37.402
And they decided on that basis that they needed 
three new campuses of 27,500 students each.

28:37.422 --> 28:41.908
And they would also expand Santa Barbara and 
Riverside and Davis.

28:45.753 --> 28:51.979
that they would have these three big new campuses.

28:51.999 --> 28:57.304
And one of these was going to be in Northern 
California and two in Southern California. And it

28:57.324 --> 28:59.906
seemed logical that one of them would be in San 
Diego County.

29:03.770 --> 29:05.171
Two in the Los Angeles area. I mean, one in the Los 
Angeles area, one new one in the Los Angeles area,

29:05.191 --> 29:11.617
plus UCLA.

29:11.637 --> 29:13.279
One new one in Northern California.

29:16.718 --> 29:32.834
And so they sort of put the School of Science and 
Engineering on the back burner and decided to go

29:16.718 --> 29:32.834
ahead with a search for sites for these three new 
campuses.

29:32.854 --> 29:46.168
And the firm of Pereira and Luckman, the 
architectural firm of Pereira and Luckman,

29:32.854 --> 29:46.168
got the job of making a survey of where the new 
campus in San Diego County should be.

29:51.278 --> 29:56.692
I thought right from the very beginning it should 
be right as close as possible to the Scripps

29:51.278 --> 29:56.692
Institution of Oceanography.

30:00.100 --> 30:08.241
The alternative would have been to build up the 
School of Science and Engineering, which they

30:00.100 --> 30:08.241
agreed to, and which they got the land for.
