WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:11.331
We had actual World War II tactics where defensive 
lines were established and tanks came. Much of our

00:12.612 --> 00:25.887
operations, I think, was defend your own 
backyard, defend your supply base, and patrol

00:26.508 --> 00:32.417
out, even with long-range patrols, patrol to find 
where the enemy is. And the difficulty in Vietnam,

00:33.018 --> 00:53.410
as opposed to most of the wars that have been fought 
by the U.S. conventional forces, is that we never

00:33.018 --> 00:53.410
were able, in many instances, to find him, fix him, 
and fight him. nowhere he is where we can fight him

00:54.048 --> 01:01.037
in a conventional manner and destroy him. The 
Vietnamese had a very good record in, I mean, I'm

01:01.258 --> 01:22.266
talking about the NDA and the VC, of ambushing U.S. 
forces,

01:01.258 --> 01:22.266
inflicting serious casualties and 
disappearance. They were very good at, by and

01:23.073 --> 01:31.202
large, very good at disappearing. What did you 
think of the fighting ability of the North

01:31.222 --> 01:38.530
Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong?

01:39.751 --> 01:46.458
The Vietnamese Viet Cong and NVA?

01:48.060 --> 01:52.084
More so the NVA, I believe, than the Viet Cong. were 
highly respected by me and the South Vietnamese.

01:58.697 --> 02:09.168
The South Vietnamese respected the NDA soldier as 
a soldier and treated them with respect when

01:58.697 --> 02:09.168
captured. The Viet Cong was considered a traitor, 
a criminal, a hoodlum, and had almost no respect.

02:21.899 --> 02:24.682
because they were traders.

02:26.123 --> 02:40.276
But as far as their fighting ability, their 
fighting ability was no different than that of the

02:26.123 --> 02:40.276
United States. And as someone said, as I recall, in 
1964, with his back against the wall, the South

02:41.878 --> 02:51.467
Vietnamese soldiers is an outstanding fighter by 
the same token. So was the NBA, so was the Vietcom.

03:01.877 --> 03:10.630
The problem was, in all cases, getting their back 
against the wall where we could get them to, where

03:01.877 --> 03:10.630
we could find them and get them to fight. As you 
know, our support, except during tremendously

03:13.094 --> 03:20.965
bad weather, was always much, to our advantage, 
overpowering. We had artillery, we had naval

03:27.864 --> 03:43.738
gunfire in certain areas, and we had aviation, 
whether it be helicopters or fixed-wing

03:27.864 --> 03:43.738
fast-movers, fighter bombers, the Air Force and 
Navy and Marine Corps fighter bombers.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.703
We had the support that they could only dream of. 
and be the recipients of loads of bombs, napalm

03:51.269 --> 04:01.859
rockets, and automatic cannons. So if we could 
find the VC or MDA, it was almost for sure an

04:01.879 --> 04:13.389
automatic win. The nights only, and I'm talking 
about the hours of darkness, and the hours of

04:20.311 --> 04:24.636
overcast, bad weather, and so forth. Only those 
periods of time normally belong to

04:25.497 --> 04:32.885
the enemy. And mostly the, except for, as you 
recalled earlier, the strategic hamlets, except

04:32.905 --> 04:48.122
for the strategic hamlets, mostly we 
outnumbered. And even our own internal support,

04:50.062 --> 05:11.661
artillery and mortars, machine guns, heavy 
machine guns, outweighed by many times over the

04:50.062 --> 05:11.661
support and the firepower of either the NVA or the 
Viet Cong.

05:15.565 --> 05:19.528
What do you feel that the military learned from 
Vietnam

05:28.486 --> 05:34.232
I would say that there were several things, and I 
would just name a couple. Number one, it is not

05:35.674 --> 05:56.856
desirable to become embroiled in a guerrilla 
warfare situation on the mainland of Asia,

05:35.674 --> 05:56.856
that the

05:35.674 --> 05:56.856
conventional forces, regardless of its support 
cannot win a war, cannot successfully fight a war

05:57.342 --> 06:12.517
without total commitment towards

05:57.342 --> 06:12.517
the war. Regardless of the type of war to be engaged 
in, that the military cannot succeed without

06:12.537 --> 06:24.970
support from the civil populace of the United 
States, nor can they win that same war without the

06:25.928 --> 06:42.814
support of the civil populace of the country that 
we're fighting in.

06:42.834 --> 06:51.868
I would say that we learned some favorable things 
from the war in Vietnam. We learned the

06:52.456 --> 06:56.580
capabilities of aviation assets. We learned the 
capabilities of our own troops. We learned the

07:00.724 --> 07:04.167
capabilities of our weapons systems. And we 
learned the weaknesses of our weapons systems. We

07:10.173 --> 07:19.662
discovered in many cases that while helicopters 
are great for moving troops, that they are very

07:10.173 --> 07:19.662
vulnerable. in situations such as we had in 
Vietnam, that they are vulnerable to small arms

07:21.548 --> 07:36.905
fire, they're vulnerable to machine guns, and to 
surface-to-air missiles. And while we paid for

07:36.925 --> 07:48.838
that knowledge, I believe that technological 
innovations to defend against those things are in

07:49.662 --> 07:57.194
fact still being utilized and we're still 
learning from the experiences in Vietnam.

07:59.677 --> 08:16.463
While a great deal of the personal memory of 
Vietnam is lost to the military now, I believe that

07:59.677 --> 08:16.463
there is still a great

08:18.367 --> 08:46.585
institutional memory of Vietnam, that the 
lessons of Vietnam have been passed from trainer

08:18.367 --> 08:46.585
to trainee, and the trainee subsequently becomes 
a trainer and has not completely lost all the

08:18.367 --> 08:46.585
knowledge that was gained, and the actual combat 
experience has not all been lost. How did you try to

08:51.063 --> 08:52.806
fight the war?

08:56.051 --> 08:57.854
Primarily from day to day. I tried to, depending 
upon what my individual job and mission might be,

08:58.915 --> 09:15.441
to try to accomplish what I perceived my mission 
might be. planned for the next day with the hope

09:16.079 --> 09:27.649
that the next day would be there to let me carry out 
what I had planned for that day.

09:29.631 --> 09:40.600
It was not a situation that I planned, began in 1964 
to plan to carry out what I did in 1971. It was a

09:41.801 --> 09:45.985
situation that in each tour I had varying missions 
that required me to do different things from time

09:46.758 --> 10:14.571
to time and I relied on my own training to guide me in 
what needed to be done and a sense of I suppose

09:46.758 --> 10:14.571
empathy for my Vietnamese counterpart if I had 
one, and empathy for the Vietnamese population,

10:14.990 --> 10:33.294
understanding that I don't understand the 
Vietnamese culture or any other colonial

10:14.990 --> 10:33.294
culture. I have some empathy toward their desire 
to be left alone, and whatever I can accomplish

10:42.479 --> 10:50.771
leaving them alone to give them some help and 
assistance towards being what they wanted. I

10:50.931 --> 10:55.297
tried to accomplish that within my capabilities. 
Did the seeming apathy among the peasants towards

10:55.317 --> 11:09.297
any particular form of government or towards the 
war in general, did that frustrate you at times?

11:12.365 --> 11:18.570
that they seem not to want us to be there, or did they 
ever seem not to want us to be there? They, to my

11:18.630 --> 11:37.327
knowledge, I never witnessed an

11:18.630 --> 11:37.327
incident where the Vietnamese populace was 
anti-US or anti-government.

11:38.588 --> 11:40.870
There were certain individuals that I observed 
and I saw who were primarily anti-government

11:42.048 --> 11:55.366
forces, anti-U.S. forces. But there were no, that 
I recall, no overt demonstrations of Yankee go

11:56.488 --> 12:05.640
home. To my knowledge, I don't I just don't recall 
ever seeing any signs that said Yankee go home or

12:09.335 --> 12:16.182
any of those things. I think that primarily the 
only sign that I did see which said Yankee go home

12:17.844 --> 12:33.520
was on the back of a U.S. Marine Corps armored 
personnel carrier.

12:34.917 --> 12:43.588
So even in 1971-72, the relations between the 
military and the populace was still good? Do you

12:43.608 --> 12:44.129
feel that? Uh-huh.

12:49.175 --> 12:53.100
I didn't have any close friends in 71-72. The 
Vietnamese had been some of the military.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.473
But the Vietnamese, I had In 71-72, I had 
Vietnamese people working for me as laborers,

13:03.875 --> 13:14.912
secretaries, clerks, cooks, bartenders, that 
type of thing. They worked for me, and they were all

13:16.234 --> 13:20.019
very friendly. Of course, that may have been 
employee-type relationships. I did not spend any

13:30.175 --> 13:33.139
more time in the civilian community that I 
absolutely had to because I had plenty to do

13:33.693 --> 13:46.332
elsewhere. In other words, I didn't have that much 
time that I could get my job done and then get out of

13:46.973 --> 13:59.933
the division headquarters area and into town. I 
just didn't go. Didn't spend any time. During the

14:04.860 --> 14:12.870
68-69 era, we were frequently in our regular 
combat patrols. We might wind up in a village and

14:12.890 --> 14:32.235
stop and have a beer, cold drink, or a bowl of rice or 
something of that nature, a bowl of soup maybe, and

14:12.890 --> 14:32.235
talk to the local cafe or restaurant proprietor, 
if you could call them a restaurant today. It was

14:32.924 --> 14:37.611
whatever. And they seemed to be friendly then. The 
merchants, the souvenir merchants around Marble

14:41.656 --> 14:49.728
Mountain in 64 were reasonably friendly. And they 
were reasonably friendly in 68 and 69. As a matter

14:56.037 --> 14:59.742
of fact, I'm talking only about what was overt now. 
I have no idea. These same people may have, as soon

15:04.922 --> 15:20.324
as we left, gone and sent a message, gone or sent a 
message to a local BC commander and told them where

15:04.922 --> 15:20.324
we were, what we were doing, and what their 
strength was. I have no idea about that.

15:25.091 --> 15:30.218
But the very few occasions that I

15:31.463 --> 15:38.512
was in the civilian community in 71 and 72. It was, 
they were,

15:39.474 --> 15:50.769
it seemed as if maybe we were treated as honored 
visitors. Of course, we were spending money. And

15:53.493 --> 16:00.542
that was, I guess that was what they were looking 
for. I can't say that I was ever treated as poorly in

16:01.400 --> 16:13.393
Vietnam as I've been treated in the United States.

16:15.595 --> 16:17.417
What do you think of journalists? Did you ever have 
a journalist go out with you on an operation? Oh,

16:20.580 --> 16:21.521
yes. I had frequently saw journalists in our area. 
is the higher the headquarters, the more

16:28.670 --> 16:33.116
journalists we normally had. And some of the 
journalists that I knew were pretty doggone good

16:34.198 --> 16:42.891
soldiers. And some of the journalists that I knew 
were nothing but cremadons. And on a few

16:50.121 --> 16:57.512
occasions, they actually interfered with our 
combat But I don't think highly of a journalist.

17:07.068 --> 17:16.381
As you may know, I was reported on at least one 
occasion in a national magazine to have been wiped

17:07.068 --> 17:16.381
out. And I believe that was the 68-69 era, probably 
sometime in the late summer of And I frequently saw

17:29.487 --> 17:44.001
things in the news magazines and in Stars and 
Stripes that I knew were to be false. But in most

17:44.201 --> 17:59.275
cases, their

17:44.201 --> 17:59.275
attitude was gathered, I believe, probably from 
dealing with the

18:02.292 --> 18:20.233
and in

18:02.292 --> 18:20.233
my case, not checking their facts before they 
started writing, basing their news reports on

18:02.292 --> 18:20.233
less than accurate information.

18:30.642 --> 18:45.695
How did you feel about, feel knowing that you were 
leaving,

18:30.642 --> 18:45.695
knowing you'd lost the war, or that the army, that 
the war was lost, or did you, I mean? I don't believe

18:45.715 --> 18:49.278
we really thought the war was lost. I thought that 
the program called Vietnamization was working at

18:49.298 --> 18:59.687
that time.

19:00.275 --> 19:23.681
probably that most of us, and myself included, 
thought that our last tour there was meant to

19:00.275 --> 19:23.681
install backbone or grow backbone in the Army of 
the Republic of Vietnam, South Harvard. I think

19:24.462 --> 19:28.847
that we believe that we've been successful 
because Now, you must realize that this was the

19:30.059 --> 19:47.760
Delta, and that we were fighting the main force NVA 
in the Delta, and we were up fighting them along

19:30.059 --> 19:47.760
what in the area is called the Parrot's Beak. I've 
never really known exactly why they call it the

19:48.581 --> 19:51.645
Parrot's Beak. except maybe it's the section of 
the border or maybe one of the rivers. It looks like

19:56.071 --> 19:57.252
Parrot's Peak. I really don't know. It's adjacent 
to Cambodia. And I think we believed that we were

20:02.480 --> 20:08.449
winning the war. And I think that the incidents 
that occurred about, I believe it was 1975, When

20:20.110 --> 20:38.152
the North actually invaded in strength and rolled 
up the army and finally made it into Saigon, wasn't

20:20.110 --> 20:38.152
that January of 75? Yeah, but we'd already pulled 
out, hadn't we? Most of our, we had pulled out,

20:43.118 --> 20:49.105
before I left there, we had pulled out all of our to 
the best of my knowledge, all of our ground combat

20:49.928 --> 20:54.815
troops. And the primary thing that was remaining 
was a little bit, maybe a few batteries of

20:54.836 --> 21:05.211
artillery, and I think they had moved out. And all 
we had left was what they call the air cavalry. and

21:12.828 --> 21:41.012
that was primarily helicopter helicopters with a 
few uh a few squads of infantry attached and it was

21:12.828 --> 21:41.012
during most of my 1971-72 tour um it was a 
vietnamese war at least in the delta there were no

21:12.828 --> 21:41.012
u.s combat troops in the delta except for the air 
cad and They were

21:41.802 --> 21:50.813
winning, and I never thought that we lost the war. 
When we're talking about the United States, the

21:52.595 --> 22:02.286
United States, contrary to what I may have said 
earlier, we didn't lose the war. We were prevented

22:03.708 --> 22:10.476
from winning the war.

22:11.418 --> 22:17.548
in effect lost the war by default. In other words, 
we quit and moved out. And you cannot win a war when

22:21.635 --> 22:26.343
you quit and move out. Now, I'll accept the fact 
that the South won the war up to a point, and then

22:26.363 --> 22:37.982
they lost it. If you want to keep score, they were 
head on points up to and including January of 1973,

22:38.840 --> 22:52.091
and maybe as late as March of 1973. As I recall, the 
very last advisor came out of the 7th Division in

22:52.952 --> 23:07.885
March of 1973, which was a little over three months 
after I left there out of the 7th Army. So, and at

23:08.253 --> 23:18.164
that time they were still, if you want to look at 
body count, they were still winning. They were

23:18.184 --> 23:26.513
killing more NBA and BC, primarily NBA, than they 
were losing soldiers. So, I guess maybe they were

23:26.533 --> 23:37.585
head on points as late as March of 1973, but 
apparently,

23:38.510 --> 23:48.221
And you'll have to remember, too, that the amount 
of supplies being delivered to Vietnam was

23:38.510 --> 23:48.221
seriously cut. The budget, the United States 
budget for support of the South Vietnamese

23:49.222 --> 24:07.403
military was severely cut

23:49.222 --> 24:07.403
before the NBA came across the demilitarized zone 
in force. So

24:15.252 --> 24:25.405
the division commander had to cut back on the 
amount of artillery he could use. The aviation

24:25.425 --> 24:31.673
assets available had to cut back on the rockets and 
machine gun ammunition. It was just a situation

24:32.514 --> 24:36.799
where you to fight the way you have been taught to 
fight over a period of years with almost unlimited

24:37.471 --> 24:50.592
assets of ammunition and combat support. Now, 
when it's no longer there, you don't know how to

24:51.834 --> 24:57.243
employ your troops the way you used to. And you'll 
have to remember also that this was one of the few

24:58.184 --> 25:03.613
times that the NVA attacked in force and became, 
I'm talking about the first time that I recall, was

25:05.332 --> 25:23.354
the summer offensive of 1972.

25:24.796 --> 25:31.744
Spring and summer offensive in 72, maybe just 
after tail offensive in 72. where they came across

25:32.264 --> 25:34.547
in force. And they were beaten to a standstill and 
pushed back, wiped out. And this is the second time

25:40.273 --> 25:42.776
that they've done it. The first time they had the 
assistance of U.S. combat support, combat

25:43.617 --> 25:54.989
service support, to deliver ammunition, replace 
losses, and so forth. In 1975, that luxury was no

25:55.550 --> 26:01.697
longer there.

26:04.175 --> 26:10.324
They ran out of ammunition, they ran out of troops, 
and there was nothing left to fight with. So I guess

26:10.344 --> 26:19.497
if you can call that a win or a loss, it's whatever 
you want to call it. So essentially, although they

26:21.500 --> 26:33.237
were on the winning side in 1972-73,

26:21.500 --> 26:33.237
when we left, when our support was... pulled from 
them that it made the turning point towards the

26:33.436 --> 26:37.541
end? Somewhere between those two dates when the 
budgets were cut and our logistical prop was

26:38.682 --> 26:57.925
removed, then they no longer had the ability to 
fight as we had taught them to fight.

27:21.344 --> 27:21.620
Thank you.
