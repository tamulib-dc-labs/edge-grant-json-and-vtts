WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:02.082
build it. Number three, you're going to fire at 
least three or four architects. They fired three.

00:07.488 --> 00:10.772
It took them two and a half times longer to build it 
than they thought. And it cost them twice as much.

00:13.315 --> 00:14.456
It cost them $12 million. It's a magnificent 
edifice. And I'm glad they did it and all that. But I

00:19.942 --> 00:22.084
really see what follows. But you were out of the 
loop at that point. I was out of sync. See, what

00:30.071 --> 00:34.498
bothered me was using annual giving money to pay 
utilities on a building they didn't need to. You

00:35.680 --> 00:43.652
know, you pay janitorial service, you pay for a big 
building like that, that land, it's not state

00:35.680 --> 00:43.652
property. At least we hung up. Oh, I've got to tell 
you a funny story. When we expanded the MSC in the

00:47.338 --> 00:50.102
early 70s,

00:52.917 --> 01:03.650
general of the Dean of Students, General 
Hennigan, was chairman of the expansion. Well,

01:03.670 --> 01:13.302
boy, no one knows this, except Tom Cherry and 
Nestle and Diebel. Diebel, they know it. We'd been

01:16.986 --> 01:18.448
occupying the West End. See, the way this started, 
We, former students, raised the money for the down

01:20.508 --> 01:24.013
payment on the MSA. I think it's about $250,000. We 
bought, that was our annual giving project when it

01:26.858 --> 01:31.805
started in 1942 that I read. That was give to the 
dream, all we had when we were in school was the

01:31.825 --> 01:36.713
YMCA. So now we're going to have the memorial 
students there dedicated to the men who gave their

01:37.534 --> 01:42.321
lives in World War II. So they raised about 
$250,000. Of course, the building cost several

01:45.967 --> 01:47.629
millions. But that paid for the architectural 
study. It paid for the other necessary things. So

01:54.110 --> 01:56.112
the former students got credit for the building. 
But the building cost a hell of a lot more than we

01:56.152 --> 01:58.375
raised. So we had an office in it. Our deal was, give 
us an office in it. Wayne Stark's on one side of the

02:03.541 --> 02:11.490
West End, and we're on the other side, which we 
outgrew real fast.

02:12.331 --> 02:14.393
So it was the next expected job. Hell, I was looking 
all over the campus for sites and locations to

02:14.473 --> 02:17.717
build. At one time, we were going to take the old 
Gilchrist home, which John Colas is in now. We're

02:22.221 --> 02:24.744
going to use that as a base and add on to the back of 
it. And Jack Williams said, yeah, now ain't that

02:25.685 --> 02:30.711
what I need, the former students in my backyard?

02:33.133 --> 02:34.194
So I always said, you're right. So then I came up 
with the idea from the architectural plan. Dee Dee

02:37.378 --> 02:38.639
Matthews, the architect. I said, Dee Dee, why 
can't we do this? I said, boy, he jumped on that.

02:45.212 --> 02:47.215
Well, I got Cecil Stewart to do a study. And with 
Cecil Stewart helping D.D. Matthews, they

02:50.720 --> 02:51.802
designed it. But I couldn't get the authority from 
the board to do it. And Rudder wouldn't push it

02:56.348 --> 02:57.750
either. Rudder was suspicious of that. Hell, he 
wanted office space himself. If you're going to

03:02.677 --> 03:04.920
build that, he wanted it, see? All Britain saved 
the day. All Britain went in there and told it.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.931
Regents what was going to happen and what we ought 
to do. And so we'd pay for it all. Well, Bob Walker

03:15.453 --> 03:21.742
and Cop Forsyth, Bob Walker got Cop to give him a 
million and a half dollars. That's what he paid

03:21.762 --> 03:22.563
for. And so with

03:23.304 --> 03:35.441
that, of course, the furnishings, we put most of 
the money in the lobby and the offices we kept

03:23.304 --> 03:35.441
pretty sparse. But we only had $120,000 to furnish 
it with. That's not a lot. We had that beautiful

03:43.372 --> 03:46.215
carpet and all that stuff. Oh, yeah, here's the 
point. So O'Hanigan didn't say anything to me

03:50.159 --> 03:54.985
about anything. And of course, I told the people, 
now this is going to be a building of the MSC. So

03:59.269 --> 04:01.552
it'll be set up for booking. You can book the 
facility, our boardroom and our lobby for use for

04:01.752 --> 04:08.299
faculty retirement, staff faculty retirement. 
It'll be part of the MSC for booking, so-and-so.

04:12.053 --> 04:15.719
And being as how we're in the building, we ought to 
be on the Centrix. Our number ought to be an 845

04:16.460 --> 04:18.283
number. Oh, yeah, that's fine. Well, about two 
years later, I got marched on. And old Tom Cherry

04:25.214 --> 04:29.120
and Lee Diebel came in there. He said, how'd you 
pull it off? Well, right then's when I should have

04:33.386 --> 04:35.670
had the Academy Award. or the Distinguished 
Alumni Award for acting. I said, pull off what? I

04:40.928 --> 04:42.851
knew damn well what. He

04:42.871 --> 04:47.458
said, you don't have an electric meter. You're not 
paying electric for this facility. And you're on

04:50.842 --> 04:55.289
the centric system, and so on, and so and so. You're 
getting janitorial service. I said, well,

04:56.951 --> 04:58.553
gentlemen, wait a minute. I said, you know, Dean 
Hannigan was in charge of this, and we agreed. They

05:03.646 --> 05:05.149
said, yeah, you conned him, didn't you? I said, no, 
sir. I said, this building, this facility is used

05:07.393 --> 05:12.884
for the Memorial Student Center. And John 
Richards

05:13.285 --> 05:21.841
will be booking this facility for use for 
continuing education or whatever else. This

05:22.282 --> 05:25.789
lobby and these offices are available, except for 
the private offices, are available for student

05:26.140 --> 05:28.062
use and the use of the university. This is a 
university facility. I said, we've got the three

05:30.124 --> 05:31.726
levels here. We've got the offices up here. And 
we've got the mail room in the basement. I said,

05:35.710 --> 05:39.094
this has made a perfect setup for everybody 
concerned. I said, it didn't interfere with any

05:39.515 --> 05:41.777
function of the university. And it added to it. It 
added another million some dollars to the

05:43.139 --> 05:48.044
building, which will be here for whatever. We'll 
probably move this office in time to come, but

05:48.424 --> 05:52.789
it'll still be available for . They said, well 
you've sold everybody else but us. I said, look, we

05:57.289 --> 06:04.439
get billed by the university for our telephone 
bill. We get billed and we pay our bills properly. I

06:06.823 --> 06:09.306
said, I bet you have agencies that don't pay as 
properly as we do. They said, that's right. And I

06:10.588 --> 06:12.711
said, let's see, what else did I say? I said that the 
association was in business to do so and so and so. I

06:20.322 --> 06:22.405
went out and gave them the biggest bullshit story. 
made them feel bad they'd ever called on me and

06:22.587 --> 06:27.713
complained about this. But all of a sudden they 
woke up, Diebel's the one that picks these little

06:27.733 --> 06:31.597
auditors. He picked that up and said, look at these 
guys. Here's a private corporation we got in the

06:35.261 --> 06:39.045
building and they're not paying rent or nothing. I 
said, well, you're lucky to have us here. Just

06:41.868 --> 06:42.829
think what we do. I said, we're on the committees 
and we serve everybody. We help out. We raised

06:47.073 --> 06:49.416
money for students and student activities. Wayne 
Stark, we've always been tied in close to Wayne and

06:49.917 --> 06:53.562
his programs. We worked with the students. This is 
an absolutely perfect setup. I said, you couldn't

06:57.128 --> 06:58.850
have it any better. I said, what if we were off in 
some thing in the corner of the campus? It wouldn't

07:02.676 --> 07:04.018
be nearly as effective. Of course, I just... They 
were ready to pull out a checkbook and give you

07:05.260 --> 07:07.122
more. We've done you wrong. But I'll tell you, my 
big surprise and shock at the fact that he was

07:11.669 --> 07:15.915
questioning a thing like that. Well, it is. Let me 
ask you, let's kind of close up, because I know I'm

07:18.722 --> 07:21.867
taking an awful lot of your time. I appreciate it. I 
may come back to you. But in the 10 years, 10, 12, 13

07:24.310 --> 07:43.036
years now that have passed since you've been in an 
official capacity with the former students, and

07:24.310 --> 07:43.036
you've had a little more objective view maybe of 
the university, what do you see as having happened

07:24.310 --> 07:43.036
that has been particularly good or particularly 
bad in these past 10 years? Of course, the next

07:43.056 --> 07:46.881
question I'm going to ask is, where do you see where 
we're going to go from here? I think the university

07:48.565 --> 07:53.710
has just done a fantastic job. I think the efforts 
to try to bring the physical plant here up to meet

07:53.770 --> 08:02.899
the needs of 41,000 students has been tremendous. 
They still have some time to go. They've got to

08:05.362 --> 08:11.408
finish this construction across the track and get 
business moved over there, readjust their use of

08:05.362 --> 08:11.408
these buildings. That's right. That whole campus 
is a post-1980 campus. That's right. Exactly. So I

08:17.810 --> 08:22.375
said, the physical plan, I said, right now they're 
using laboratories all hours of the day and night.

08:25.538 --> 08:29.142
But I think the future is we're gearing a lot of it 
for high tech. And that's where it's got to go. I

08:31.184 --> 08:32.185
think two things. I think, one, liberal arts has 
got to take a stronger position because of the

08:32.265 --> 08:40.833
universal nature of our university. We now have to 
gear our university for worldwide. They're

08:44.097 --> 08:47.260
talking about this economy is a universal 
economy. Our education has to be the same way,

08:47.442 --> 08:52.809
which means we're going to have to be bigger and 
stronger in modern language and in history. Our

08:53.710 --> 09:01.280
people have to be a little better educated 
intellectually,

08:53.710 --> 09:01.280
along with the high tech. High tech and 
engineering and science and other things has got

09:01.300 --> 09:08.870
to meet the needs of just, what, seven years away. 
We're entering into a new century. And business is

09:11.032 --> 09:16.099
going to be different in all parts of the world.

09:17.193 --> 09:26.502
Our technology programs of the past are job 
related, doing jobs, a specific task in

09:17.193 --> 09:26.502
electronics and mechanics and whatnot. I think 
probably

09:26.522 --> 09:33.869
education has got to gear itself more to the 
intellectual. We've got to compete with leaders

09:33.889 --> 09:38.054
from Japan and from Europe. Europe people seem to 
be better educated than our people are. It depends

09:40.976 --> 09:45.681
on the technical or engineering curricula, 
whether you can. do all this, but I think we're

09:46.285 --> 09:53.796
geared in that direction, and I think that we're 
getting a different type of leader, too. We're

09:53.836 --> 09:59.224
getting a psychologist as president of the 
university. I think one thing I think that's just

09:59.244 --> 10:04.691
fantastic is the way we conduct these 
commitments. They're killers now for the

10:04.752 --> 10:07.315
registrar's office. They're killers for the 
president and the deans and people. But like we

10:09.919 --> 10:14.165
have seven of them, imagine they did four of them. 
We had one at 11, one at two, one at 7.30, then they

10:16.390 --> 10:20.194
had one at Saturday morning. But the fact that they 
give them a diploma that's completed, the former

10:20.955 --> 10:36.050
students gives them a little miniature diploma 
for their billfold, and the fact that the

10:20.955 --> 10:36.050
president hands them—see, every other major 
university in the world bails them the diploma. No

10:36.070 --> 10:37.472
one tries to do this. I never thought we'd do it. I 
said, that's one thing that the new registrar will

10:39.194 --> 10:41.716
drop. Listen, he's gung-ho for it. Mobley's 
gung-ho for it. And Mobley gets in there, those

10:46.107 --> 10:51.053
little pre-commencement, and they're just 
wondering. Gives everybody a nice book. I get to

10:52.614 --> 10:55.137
give you a book called Neil Ford Architect. I love 
that because I know a lot of people in it. Aggies,

10:57.840 --> 11:01.644
Brooks Martin, and lots of other guys. So I love it. 
But anyway, I'm just saying. So they give you that

11:03.426 --> 11:04.528
personal touch. Yeah. We're a big 40,000 student. 
We're going to get bigger. And, of course, I think

11:08.804 --> 11:10.627
it's too bad. I just hate turning down a 
well-qualified student. It just breaks my heart

11:14.673 --> 11:21.263
to see, especially one of our former students, has 
a grandchild or something like that. And I think

11:22.164 --> 11:25.529
something should be done to offset that a little 
bit. I just hate to say you've got 16,000 qualified

11:25.610 --> 11:30.958
applicants, but we're only going to take six. 
We're only going to take 2,000 transfer students.

11:35.332 --> 11:37.235
And so many graduate students and so on. Of course, 
the graduate students, I realize that's got to be

11:37.255 --> 11:40.219
limited. You can only take, your faculty can only 
handle so many in the advanced degrees. I realize

11:45.626 --> 11:46.347
that. But the undergraduate degree, I think 
that's got to continue to be strong. We can't ever

11:50.293 --> 11:51.614
neglect that. The teaching of freshmen has got, 
the nicest compliment I heard said was by my

11:51.975 --> 11:57.042
scholar. His name is Daniel Kent from Austin. He 
said, my buddies over there are in class with

11:59.806 --> 12:03.331
hundreds of people. And over here, I'm in class 
with tens of people. I've just got 20, 30 people in

12:06.290 --> 12:08.353
my class. He said, this is far better teaching 
university than the University of Texas at

12:08.373 --> 12:13.199
Austin. From what he hears, his sister goes there 
and his best friend goes there. He got a

12:17.405 --> 12:19.267
presidential scholar to come here. And he's 
thrilled to death with it. But he just thinks his

12:21.951 --> 12:25.996
teachers are wonderful. He says, my faculty 
members are just great. And one of my lady friends

12:29.821 --> 12:33.486
in San Antonio's son is here. I'm going to tell you a 
story about that. A year ago, sophomore year, he

12:36.773 --> 12:42.160
was having a terrible time with accounting. This 
is a guy that puts on magic shows. This is a guy that

12:44.382 --> 12:46.465
entertains. He's an out people person. Yeah. And 
he's taking accountants. Because his dad says,

12:50.349 --> 12:52.292
oh, learn to be an accountant. Take business and 
accountants. So he's over here. And every

12:55.575 --> 13:03.625
Valentine's Day, his grandmother, who is a lovely 
lady, but oh, she's rich as hell. And she sends me

13:04.162 --> 13:09.291
some money to buy a Russell Stover box of 
Valentine's. See, his mother, who was the same age

13:09.591 --> 13:14.960
as my daughter when she died, who's this woman's 
daughter. She's a granddaughter, see, this kid.

13:17.765 --> 13:20.730
So the boy said, oh, they're having a terrible 
time. The emperor's down and so on. I said to him, he

13:22.653 --> 13:24.717
said, wait. He said, I don't know. He said, I think 
I'll transfer. I said, wait a minute. Why don't you

13:29.255 --> 13:34.019
go see your advisor and tell him you'd like to get 
permission to talk to people in liberal arts? I

13:34.079 --> 13:35.740
said, you ought to transfer to liberal arts. You 
shouldn't be taking accounting. I said, you're

13:37.902 --> 13:40.044
not going to be an accountant. I said, you need to 
get into modern language, get into history, and

13:40.925 --> 13:50.773
get into

13:40.925 --> 13:50.773
literature, things that you really like. I said, 
you're a good reader. I said, you do well on tests

13:52.795 --> 13:54.957
and all that stuff. This year, this Valentine's 
Day, I go pick him up, and he's got an apartment off

13:59.933 --> 14:03.844
campus at Northgate. Those nice apartments are 
just down Nagle Street. And I'm thinking, well,

14:09.856 --> 14:11.638
boy, he's happy. I said, we're going to go. Oh, 
let's go to so-and-so. I said, well, you're

14:14.482 --> 14:15.764
smiling this year. He said, boy, that advice you 
gave me, I switched to liberal arts. He said, I'm

14:19.890 --> 14:21.492
making straight A's. I joined a fraternity. I 
said, get in a fraternity. You didn't get in the

14:24.557 --> 14:25.478
Corps. I said, get in a fraternity. Go around and 
pledge these outfits. They want you. You got the

14:29.684 --> 14:30.405
money. So got in the fraternity down there on Texas 
Avenue or something like that. He loves his

14:35.270 --> 14:41.058
buddies he's made in there, he's made friends, 
he's made his friends, and he's just gung-ho, see?

14:41.078 --> 14:42.740
A little bit of... I think I said, I think one nice 
thing about the university now is there's more

14:42.760 --> 14:50.972
opportunities for more divergent types, I guess. 
And that's part of being a big university. And you

14:52.754 --> 14:55.318
know what this university has that no one has? All 
these... Oh, that's a mower. All of these student

15:00.806 --> 15:03.189
organizations. Mm-hmm. I've never seen it like 
that. That's right. Up in the MSC, there are

15:06.355 --> 15:08.778
hundreds. That's a training ground. Yeah, for 
leadership. That MSC council director, that's

15:11.881 --> 15:14.484
fabulous. No one's got anything that big. And over 
there in Carolyn A. Dare's office, man, you can get

15:15.965 --> 15:25.255
anything there from climbing mountains in Italy 
to skiing down mountains. I mean, these clubs,

15:25.335 --> 15:28.778
there are hundreds and hundreds of clubs. I became 
so aware of that. Of course, I used to raise money

15:31.582 --> 15:34.305
and finance them, just like I did for the Calvary. I 
did that outside of the budget. And like the soccer

15:37.629 --> 15:44.236
team and the cricket team and the rugby team and all 
those things. I was on that MSC board. What was it?

15:47.079 --> 15:49.101
Advisory Council, I guess, for some years. That 
was really interesting. I enjoyed that. I never

15:50.803 --> 15:52.545
did them much good, but it was interesting. The 
students here get a well-rounded education. They

15:53.827 --> 15:54.407
really do. I'm impressed with them. And I hope my 
granddaughters will. Of course, I'll sure take

15:58.091 --> 15:59.513
them over there. They're good students and 
they're going to be, and one of them says, Papo,

15:59.999 --> 16:07.448
would you mind if I took education? I said, I'd be 
thrilled. I'd be thrilled. I said, anything you

16:09.730 --> 16:15.857
want to take, I said, except if you're going to take 
music, you can't go to A&M. I said, A&M does not have

16:15.897 --> 16:19.081
a music, it never will have one. We've got a 
department now, but no degree in it. People can

16:22.205 --> 16:24.387
take courses over there, real good. Of course, 
they can learn to sing and play and do all that kind

16:24.788 --> 16:29.217
of stuff, but they're not going to ever get a degree 
in it. I don't think we need a college of music. And

16:31.882 --> 16:33.045
we shouldn't ever have one. But it's good to offer 
courses in it here. That's all right. They have

16:35.931 --> 16:39.257
some good instructors and people. I don't know if 
they have any professors or not. The university is

16:42.724 --> 16:44.468
just a The only problem I see is they can't 
accommodate these good students. They can't get

16:49.692 --> 16:50.533
in. That just breaks my heart. But actually, we're 
limited by facilities and by faculty. We have to

16:55.661 --> 17:05.717
have enough good teachers, and I hope we never 
lose, I hope the faculty never does, let's

16:55.661 --> 17:05.717
research and that sort of thing, take over from the 
teaching role. Yeah, that's going to be a problem.

17:08.258 --> 17:09.841
It's already a problem. Already a problem, right? 
What about the Corps? Do you think they're going to

17:13.246 --> 17:19.496
continue to exert some kind of spiritual or 
moral... I think the Corps is always going to be

17:19.917 --> 17:22.641
here, maybe smaller, smaller. I think we'll have 
1,000 to 1,500 people in it. I don't think it's ever

17:26.728 --> 17:34.300
going to be the big influential

17:26.728 --> 17:34.300
Corps that it should be because there's two 
problems. One, the type of student that comes out

17:35.225 --> 17:46.598
of the homes of Texas and America today are not 
conducive to high states of discipline,

17:35.225 --> 17:46.598
especially where they get hollered at. And as a 
freshman, they're going to be hollered at. It's

17:48.940 --> 17:50.221
what it is. It's Marine Corps training. It's just 
making beds and shining your shoes. That's

17:54.666 --> 17:55.627
hazing, see? I think the push-ups and all that sort 
of stuff, that shouldn't harm anybody. But see,

18:00.493 --> 18:01.894
kids don't like to do that. It's a thing that's 
distractive to them. It's distractive to the

18:05.077 --> 18:06.600
faculty. They have to listen to people bitch about 
it. A little girl told an old Henry Wendler

18:09.186 --> 18:15.139
columnist, but who's in charge down there? I said, 
well, Henry in charge of what? Who's in charge of

18:16.422 --> 18:17.584
hazing? I said, Henry, the people that are in 
charge of hazing are the people that are doing it.

18:25.346 --> 18:28.189
He said, Buck, you're pretty damn smart. He says, 
you're right. He said, I wanted to find out if you

18:30.791 --> 18:34.174
knew who the hell is in charge of hazing. He said, 
I'll tell you what I did. I talked to Mobley up here,

18:36.356 --> 18:41.962
and I said, Mobley, the girl on my scholarship has 
got out of the Corps. And he said, they just hazed

18:43.183 --> 18:47.807
her too much, and she couldn't accept that, so she 
got out. He said, now, who's in charge of that? What

18:51.287 --> 18:52.729
happens to that girl down there? Mobley says, 
well, I don't know. She'll have to talk to John

18:54.231 --> 18:55.473
Coldis. He says, that Coldis comes under student . 
So he came down here, went over, talked to Coldis.

19:01.161 --> 19:03.605
And Coldis says, well, that's in the Corps. You'll 
have to talk to General Darling about that. So he

19:06.068 --> 19:07.991
goes over and sees General Darling. And General 
Darling says, wait a minute. We have a lady, a major

19:09.874 --> 19:13.299
here, that'll take you down to the dormitory. So he 
took this woman, Major Tober, to the dormitory.

19:18.550 --> 19:27.882
They found the upperclassman of the class woman, 
or man, I don't know who was doing it, but it was

19:18.550 --> 19:27.882
Hazender, see? And he said,

19:28.102 --> 19:39.116
Henry said, why did you tell this girl that she 
couldn't keep her civilian clothes in here, that

19:28.102 --> 19:39.116
she couldn't go to the bathroom after 10.30 at 
night? If she had to, she had to pee in the sink and

19:39.717 --> 19:42.160
that sort of thing. And the sophomore said, 
because that's tradition, sir. He said, hell, if

19:47.778 --> 19:52.425
it's tradition, the sophomores are going to keep 
hazing the freshmen, see? The commandant can't

19:53.207 --> 19:54.930
stop that. You can't have someone sleeping with 
everybody in the court. So as long as you've got a

19:58.756 --> 20:03.303
hazing system, which, see, it's a quasi-military 
thing. That's really not military. It's like boot

20:05.747 --> 20:07.009
camp, see? It's boot camp. It's like OCS. And when 
you have that situation, whether it's uniforms,

20:11.236 --> 20:15.102
whether it's shoes, whether it's beds to be made 
and whether it's spoken words said in West Point,

20:15.571 --> 20:25.261
Annapolis, Air Force Academy, you can't 
eliminate it. It can't be eliminated. Now, the

20:26.882 --> 20:34.229
former students got a big committee challenged by 
the regents to come up with a study, and the Corps

20:26.882 --> 20:34.229
has been studied to death here. What they need to do 
is let the Corps study itself gather all these

20:35.030 --> 20:44.059
seniors and juniors and so on, like I used to take 
them all out of the country, and I determined right

20:35.030 --> 20:44.059
then, not a damn thing I could do or say or the former 
students are going to say. All I told them about was

20:45.897 --> 20:54.210
what your goal has to be is to make the Corps so 
attractive, like a fraternity or sorority, that

20:45.897 --> 20:54.210
the kids want to be in it. And it could work. They 
want to be in it. Now, if you can create that

20:56.533 --> 21:02.282
atmosphere in the Corps, well, you'll have 3,000 
kids in the Corps. That's about how many of those 12

21:02.302 --> 21:07.490
dorms will hold, about 3,000, 1,500 on each side. 
And I said, when you get that, Then you can call them

21:09.892 --> 21:14.456
out and just take specific ones of the Corps. But 
see, what I'll say is this. The quality is so high.

21:17.979 --> 21:22.843
God, those kids, they're gung-ho, all-American 
kids. Good-looking and proud, you know. But

21:25.846 --> 21:28.348
there's not very many of them. They've only got 
about 1,600 over there. It's going to be tight with

21:30.010 --> 21:34.033
the funding and all that kind of stuff. It's going 
to be a lot of power. Those damn dorms aren't worth a

21:36.956 --> 21:38.637
damn. They never have been. I couldn't believe it. 
You know, my class was the first ones in those

21:40.723 --> 21:44.126
dorms. Freshman year, I lived in Milder Hall. Then 
at summer of 38, opened in 39. Well, they started in

21:49.392 --> 21:51.394
38. And when I saw those dorms, they're just like 
prison barracks. And hell, they're conducive to

21:56.719 --> 21:58.741
hazing. It's just terrible. They got them 
air-conditioned, and they got carpets on the

22:00.603 --> 22:04.587
floor so they're not as noisy. but but uh hell those 
you know i said god you could slaughter 100 people

22:04.972 --> 22:31.013
up here no no just put a guard at each end to watch the 
buzz don't come in you know that that was my first

22:04.972 --> 22:31.013
impression he and him was not here but when i was in 
school at texas in the 50s 52 to 56 i remember one

22:04.972 --> 22:31.013
year i drove back made a loop down through the 
campus on this this was gravel road i believe

22:04.972 --> 22:31.013
millican was right and i remember seeing the dorms 
and that Like a prison. Look, it's just gruesome. I

22:33.462 --> 22:35.144
couldn't believe it, yeah. I didn't know much 
about A&M, although Louisiana people, you know,

22:35.164 --> 22:40.550
A&M was well regarded. When you look at Hart Hall 
and Walton Hall and Puryear and Law and Puryear and

22:41.611 --> 22:52.042
Hart and Walton, they're built on a ramp system. 
You come in and you've got three or four rooms. No,

22:55.405 --> 22:58.529
you've got three rooms and a shower and a bath. Then 
you go up, you've got three. So you have up this

22:59.530 --> 23:00.831
ramp. Well, you can only kill about three rooms of 
kids at a time that way, see. What I'm saying is it's

23:04.930 --> 23:09.918
not as conducive to hazing as the long cell block 
system is. I hated those doors because they're not

23:10.179 --> 23:13.745
conducive to study. They're not conducive to 
anything except put a bunch of prisoners in. Lock

23:16.850 --> 23:18.613
the damn door and throw the key away. That's a good 
analogy. That's interesting. Well, Buck, I

23:21.377 --> 23:23.781
appreciate everything and all of that. keep in 
touch, and in fact, as this thing develops, I'll

23:24.200 --> 23:26.925
come back. Oh, well, I'm sorry we took so long. Oh, 
no, I'm not sorry. It would take long. I don't want

23:31.293 --> 23:32.596
to burn you out completely. I may come back. But if 
you will, as this thing develops, I'll call on you

23:34.700 --> 23:39.289
to kind of look at it. You've done this before. Tell 
me where I've erred. Any, well...
