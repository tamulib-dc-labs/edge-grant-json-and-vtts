00:15.995 --> 00:18.839
What's your personal opinion of Amtrak? My 
personal opinion of Amtrak is that it started off

00:18.979 --> 00:22.504
on the wrong foot. Why? It started off with its own 
organization to rethink railroad passenger

00:24.466 --> 00:29.093
service. Well, that's not necessarily bad, but 
they hired the occupants from the bus line and the

00:29.113 --> 00:37.945
airlines to try to make a passenger train over and 
stay by an airline. That doesn't work. They really

00:40.408 --> 00:45.495
hired very few railroad passenger people when 
Amtrak was moved. they have subsequently hired a

00:46.403 --> 00:49.686
fair number of people from the railroads. And I 
think that has improved both the relationship

00:50.647 --> 01:03.057
between Amtrak and the railroads, because now 
Amtrak as a corporation has a better

00:50.647 --> 01:03.057
understanding of the problems involving those 
trains. And it's more willing to work with the

01:03.078 --> 01:09.143
railroads to solve problems, rather than in the 
early 70s use an adversarial position. The

01:10.404 --> 01:16.309
railroads versus Amtrak, Amtrak versus the 
railroads, nothing really got accomplished.

01:17.352 --> 01:22.157
How did Amtrak have its impact on the services 
offered? Did Amtrak have the funds to reinstate

01:22.698 --> 01:31.366
most of the services that had been taken out just 
prior to its emergence? No, Amtrak, during its

01:31.386 --> 01:37.413
early days, never had much funding. And it lived 
from year to year. It could never make any

01:39.975 --> 01:41.817
long-range plans. It also... Excuse me. But 
also... Amtrak

01:48.605 --> 02:05.262
was originally supposed to be a profit-making

01:48.605 --> 02:05.262
corporation. Amtrak was established by law as a 
profit-making organization. But it's not making

02:09.446 --> 02:10.567
profit. It has never made profit, and it depends on 
public funds for its survival. In recent years, it

02:17.073 --> 02:22.119
has had enough funding where it can make advanced 
plans. It has completely re-equipped its fleet in

02:22.139 --> 02:26.504
the last two or three years. The equipment that it 
inherited from the railroads were anywhere from,

02:27.785 --> 02:36.315
dated from 1935 through 1960 vintage. Did Amtrak 
have a problem in that it acquired equipment from

02:36.735 --> 02:43.003
various lines and it wasn't standardized? That's 
right. Each railroad had its own design for cars.

02:47.583 --> 02:53.210
They were all worked together, run together, but 
they all had the same general specifications. But

02:54.231 --> 03:03.583
the railroads running across Dakotas and Montana 
had a car that were heavily insulated because of

02:54.231 --> 03:03.583
the cold pipes and the cold weather. The railroads 
running between New York and Florida had a

03:03.603 --> 03:08.129
different type of car. They weren't so heavily 
insulated. But each railroad knew its equipment

03:12.134 --> 03:15.919
and knew where it should run. And they were pretty 
much kept to these roofs. Well, when Amtrak took

03:18.511 --> 03:22.116
over, it mixed all the equipment up. They would 
take the Florida cars and send them up to the

03:23.458 --> 03:27.163
Washington, Montana area. And these people up 
there had never seen those cars before. And they

03:30.428 --> 03:33.272
didn't know what to do to fix them when they went 
back. And they took the Montana and Dakota cars and

03:33.492 --> 03:37.478
shipped them down to Florida. People there had the 
same problem. Because each other's, they had to do

03:40.222 --> 03:46.311
different equipment, electrical equipment, air 
conditioning equipment. And then the first

03:46.898 --> 03:54.086
winter in Amtrak, one of all those cars that were 
running across Dakota and Montana were freezing

03:46.898 --> 03:54.086
up every trip. Well, it turns out they were all the 
Florida cars. They were using the wrong equipment

03:56.629 --> 03:58.511
in the wrong spot. And it was just things like that 
when Amtrak was new that were really dumb

03:58.971 --> 04:03.056
mistakes. How did the government handle these 
problems? Did the government realize that Amtrak

04:06.719 --> 04:12.446
wasn't making as much money as it was supposed to 
make? Yes. In fact, there were several attempts

04:13.707 --> 04:16.450
along the way to kill Amtrak. Really?

04:21.007 --> 04:29.064
But there was always enough senators and 
congressmen who wanted to see the train run

04:21.007 --> 04:29.064
through their cities that kept Amtrak alive. And 
that's another problem with Amtrak. It started

04:30.568 --> 04:31.911
off with a core system. Before it could improve its 
core system, the senator of this particular

04:36.967 --> 04:41.914
state, or the congressman from this time, insist 
on having a train through his town. He was on the

04:42.194 --> 04:45.439
House Transportation Committee. He got his train 
through his town. And that train would just lose

04:47.562 --> 04:52.228
bunches and bunches of money, but it went from 
nowhere to nowhere. They restricted political

04:53.169 --> 04:57.535
trains, and Amtrak was saddled with many of them. 
There was no rational need for the trains, except

04:59.077 --> 05:05.286
it was a political expediency to keep Amtrak 
alive. What were some of the benefits that came

05:05.485 --> 05:11.413
from the Amtrak takeover? Well, the one benefit 
from Amtrak takeover, we did have a nationwide

05:11.433 --> 05:20.446
system, and you can make a reservation anywhere in 
the country fairly quickly. The railroads had the

05:20.726 --> 05:32.342
same type of reservation, but sometimes it took 
days and days to get that reservation confirmed

05:20.726 --> 05:32.342
because they had to wire right from one railroad to 
another. Amtrak would What was the public

05:34.780 --> 05:50.122
attitude

05:34.780 --> 05:50.122
towards

05:34.780 --> 05:50.122
Amtrak? At first the public was very pleased with 
Amtrak, that they were going to save the Passion

05:51.644 --> 05:59.475
Terrain, restore it to its former glory, and 
increase all sorts of services. Although the

05:59.495 --> 06:02.880
public became very disillusioned.

06:03.974 --> 06:11.748
There were a lot of hot cars, shipping these cars 
around the country, people didn't know how to fix

06:03.974 --> 06:11.748
them. I would see cars come out of New Orleans on the 
Sunset Limit and come to Houston. The ASP

06:17.718 --> 06:21.825
mechanics, Southern City mechanics, used to try 
to fix the car. Well, it was not a car they were

06:21.845 --> 06:28.497
familiar with, and they would sometimes hold that 
train for an extra 30 minutes just trying to fix the

06:21.845 --> 06:28.497
air conditioning on one sleeping car. And 
finally, they'd equip their hands and say, I can

06:29.000 --> 06:31.584
fix it. And so the train would go, and the next 
station would try to fix it, and that type of thing.

06:36.310 --> 06:43.039
But once Amtrak standardized on its equipment and 
hired its own mechanical forces, a lot of those

06:36.310 --> 06:43.039
problems went away. About what time did the 
problems start going away? Well, in the mid, oh,

06:46.304 --> 06:55.697
about 1976 or 7, they started getting these, what 
they called amp-lead equipment, and more recent.

06:55.997 --> 06:56.678
And these are... body shell, very similar to the 
Metroliner trains, which the Pennsylvania

06:58.818 --> 07:07.472
Railroad developed

06:58.818 --> 07:07.472
in the 1960s. And they had what they call AM coaches 
and AM dinettes and AM lounge cars. They did not

07:14.022 --> 07:16.587
have any sticky cars in this configuration. These 
were all what we call head-in power. When the

07:20.152 --> 07:24.960
railroad passenger cars all had, were 
self-contained, they had a battery. which

07:25.598 --> 07:27.440
powered the car when it was down in the scale. They 
had generators in these cars which generated

07:27.460 --> 07:33.529
electricity and the car would move it. Sometimes 
they had steam air conditioning based on a steam

07:33.549 --> 07:42.420
boiler in the diesel engine. And in the winter, all 
the trains were heated by steam. Again, the steam

07:44.824 --> 07:50.091
boiler in the diesel locomotives, or in the early 
days, the steam locomotives. Well, Amtrak has

07:50.111 --> 07:54.036
converted the heating power, which says that 
there is a generator on the diesel. And this

07:56.401 --> 08:00.945
generator produces all the electricity for the 
train. The cars are no longer self-contained.

08:02.987 --> 08:06.890
They don't have any batteries, except for 
emergency lighting. They don't have to generate

08:06.910 --> 08:08.592
their own power at all. So as long as everything is 
working fine on the head end, or there's no

08:09.092 --> 08:14.377
problems with the wiring between cars, it works 
very well. More recently, Amtrak has taken this

08:15.938 --> 08:22.084
same philosophy and gone one step further with 
their superliner equipment. The superliners are

08:23.885 --> 08:32.559
They have

08:23.885 --> 08:32.559
both sleeping cars, coaches, and dining cars, and 
lounge cars. When did these cars start? These came

08:34.922 --> 08:36.846
in about 1980. Those are very recent. Very recent. 
Yes. Well, let's see. What's the current public

08:44.692 --> 08:48.397
attitude towards rail travel with these 
improvements? I think it's looking at, you know,

08:48.637 --> 08:55.325
there's a lot of people who enjoy the train rides. 
Let me step back. In the early 1970s, when

08:56.627 --> 09:06.919
Anchorage was first organized, they had what they 
called advisory councils in different cities in

08:56.627 --> 09:06.919
the country. And I was participating in the 
advisory council in Houston. And this is where I

09:13.227 --> 09:15.249
was having a lot of problems. We would just 
generally talk about things that could do or

09:15.449 --> 09:23.177
should be doing could do down the road. I got very 
discouraged early on because some of the official

09:24.458 --> 09:30.324
that come out of Chicago for the advisory. Don't 
not to worry. All right. We have a problem. Only 3%

09:33.627 --> 09:38.492
of the population has ridden our train. We have 97% 
of the public out there still to go. Well, that's

09:42.893 --> 09:46.620
not true, because you don't have 97% of the public 
to draw from. You have maybe at the most 10% of the

09:46.640 --> 09:49.466
public to draw from. The other 90% don't want to 
spend the time traveling by train. They want to get

09:53.593 --> 09:56.599
there in three hours by air, or they want to drive, 
or whatever. So you really, passenger service is a

09:57.481 --> 10:05.897
very small market sector that you could possibly 
draw from. And then things got progressively

10:08.240 --> 10:09.943
worse. Equipment got more decrepit. Amtrak could 
not maintain it. They were told to make money on

10:15.571 --> 10:29.371
dining car service, which the railroad never had 
been able to do, and railroad drew dining cars sort

10:15.571 --> 10:29.371
of as a lost leader, like in a store where they had to 
price something at low cost to attract patronage.

10:33.337 --> 10:36.542
In about 1980, I would say about the lowest point 
ever, They had all this new soup line equipment,

10:37.130 --> 10:42.937
all the fancy new ranges and what have you, 
electric ranges. And all they were serving was

10:43.718 --> 10:47.403
McDonald's type food, but not up to McDonald's 
standards. And they took the stewards off the

10:48.564 --> 10:52.569
dining car and the waiters. They had two waiters 
for a full length dining car. And people would come

10:55.293 --> 10:59.338
in to be served, say a family of four. And one of them 
would get served, and five minutes later somebody

11:00.139 --> 11:05.065
else would get served. And it just was not, it was 
disorganized. And I remember one trip I took in

11:08.163 --> 11:14.110
Chicago to Los Angeles, and I was going to continue 
riding on Amtrak when I got to Los Angeles. I was so

11:14.130 --> 11:17.635
fed up with the service, the food, the quality of 
the food and everything. I was like, I found my

11:17.655 --> 11:25.264
first pay phone in Los Angeles, a passenger 
terminal, call an airline, make a new

11:17.655 --> 11:25.264
reservation. Competing industries are taking 
away the customers. But since Graham Clayton, who

11:29.790 --> 11:36.779
was formerly president of Southern Railway and 
president of Amtrak, a lot has happened. A lot has

11:36.799 --> 11:37.439
changed. He... Those railroads, he's been in the 
railroads industry his entire life.

11:46.230 --> 11:57.048
These so-called marketing people or analytical 
people in Washington who don't know anything

11:46.230 --> 11:57.048
about railroads

11:46.230 --> 11:57.048
but try to market it. He gave them short shrift, and 
they really just told them, shape up or ship out.

12:04.621 --> 12:05.322
He's put quality first. originally quality food 
back in the dining cars. It does have restrictions

12:07.952 --> 12:14.382
on how much money you can spend and lose, but things 
are really looking up. All the onboard people now

12:15.324 --> 12:20.452
are re-employed by Amtrak. The railroads provide 
the conductors and breakmen and engineers on most

12:20.472 --> 12:24.299
of the routes.

12:28.245 --> 12:32.372
But the big sleeping car attendants, the waiters, 
and so forth are all Amtrak employees. If the

12:32.690 --> 12:40.359
attitude is looking up, are there any plans to 
expand the services offered, put more lines out?

12:40.379 --> 12:51.031
Amtrak is out looking at the possibility of new 
routes, but their funding is limited and they're

12:40.379 --> 12:51.031
still trying to improve the service they have. For 
example, the train between New Orleans through

12:51.051 --> 12:59.541
Houston to Los Angeles only runs three times a 
week. Years ago, they should have put that daily,

13:02.018 --> 13:08.365
but it had not been able to find it. Now, for the 
Louisiana World's Fair, they are putting on a

13:08.385 --> 13:16.094
special train from Mobile to New Orleans, which 
they hope to try to take from this. The states are

13:16.114 --> 13:19.878
also helping support that. That's this summer.

13:24.483 --> 13:25.044
This summer, that's correct. What about the 
possibility of the bullet train from Houston to

13:25.064 --> 13:31.131
Dallas? That's an interesting concept. I'm 
interested in seeing if they can finance it. How do

13:35.803 --> 13:36.624
you feel about that? Do you think it has any future? 
I think it has a future. I think that railroad

13:40.349 --> 13:48.860
tracks in eastern Dallas could be a viable... 
Yeah, if you have sufficient tight... sufficient

13:40.349 --> 13:48.860
train. Recently, Amtrak looked at the 
possibility of rerouting to Sunset, Memphis,

13:49.881 --> 13:58.833
which is the... up to Dallas, then out to El Paso. 
That way. Well, as long as there's only...

14:01.958 --> 14:07.044
Tri-weekly service, you're not going to track 
people right. And even if they put that train on

14:07.204 --> 14:15.252
daily, it still wouldn't do it because you could 
only go one direction and make a round trip. You

14:15.313 --> 14:26.785
need to have at least twice a day service on a 
corridor type route so that people can go up in the

14:15.313 --> 14:26.785
morning, do their business, and the other city can 
return home if you want to try to save the business

14:15.313 --> 14:26.785
crowd. In the 1950s

14:28.098 --> 14:41.951
and early 60s, when I used to travel to Dallas on 
vacation by train, I could go up in the morning and

14:28.098 --> 14:41.951
do whatever I wanted to do and come back home that 
evening. And people in Dallas used to do the same

14:41.971 --> 14:43.893
thing. But when we'd be down to only one train a day, 
well, I'd cut out over half of your passenger. That

14:50.058 --> 14:55.804
would add a cost of a motel room for every night onto 
the price per ticket. Well, with all the airline

14:55.824 --> 14:57.345
service, Yeah, I mean, it was hard to compete with 
the Southwest $30 and $40 fares. Well, was the

15:04.772 --> 15:09.939
government this past year threatening to cut 
funding again? Uh, I have... I'm not aware of that.

15:16.407 --> 15:23.356
Amtrak seems to try to secure its return funding, 
but they are being encouraged to try to cover more

15:16.407 --> 15:23.356
of the costs out of the fare box. And they are doing 
better. What did Amtrak have as an impact on, say,

15:25.186 --> 15:33.735
the private

15:25.186 --> 15:33.735
car owners? Let me stop that for a second. Thanks. 
OK. As I mentioned earlier, in the 20s, before,

15:35.818 --> 15:41.864
there were a lot of affluent people handling their 
own private railroad cars. And more recently, a

15:44.407 --> 15:54.298
different group, some of them very affluent, some 
of them just common workers, started buying

15:44.407 --> 15:54.298
railroad cars that were owned and operated. And, 
well, while Amtrak was very negative about

15:56.017 --> 16:09.297
handling these private cars, but now Amtrak 
realizes that it really doesn't cost them

15:56.017 --> 16:09.297
anything to pull these cars. Why were they 
negative about pulling the cars? Really, they

16:12.922 --> 16:15.046
weren't set up to handle them. I would say the 
people who ran Amtrak at that time were not very

16:15.066 --> 16:21.976
loyal to them. They didn't realize that they would 
make a lot of money. at a relatively lower expense

16:24.839 --> 16:28.023
than that. So the private car owner, when he puts 
his car up to 20, pays for 20 fares, whether it's in

16:28.043 --> 16:37.594
one person or 20 people in the car. Anybody over 20 
in the car, there are extra fares of Amtrak. Gets a

16:42.060 --> 16:48.147
minimum of 20 fares up to how it remains on the car. 
But Amtrak now realizes that What were some of the

16:52.615 --> 16:56.619
demands? Well, they wanted work done on their 
equipment. Some of the cars were not in too good

17:08.091 --> 17:19.443
shape. There was a whole list of it. people, 
agitations on both sides. And that resulted in an

17:27.509 --> 17:38.551
organization formed known as the American 
Association of Private Car Owners. And this

17:38.571 --> 17:40.194
association had this sort of a buffer between 
private car owners. And it resolved a lot of

17:40.214 --> 17:41.877
differences and problems. Many of the problems 
that were there 10 years ago have been resolved by

17:42.397 --> 17:49.947
mutual cooperation and dualization. Has your 
club experienced any of these problems in trying

17:50.087 --> 17:55.494
to pull its private cars on anti-trainers? Yes, 
we've experienced two problems. One of them, we

17:58.017 --> 18:04.325
had a problem with the southern city railroad in 
that they started switching the car around. That

18:04.345 --> 18:06.227
problem has been resolved. through our 
satisfaction, so we have no problem with the

18:08.300 --> 18:17.709
impact. The main problem with the impact is that 
it's

18:17.729 --> 18:28.900
difficult to get them to go to fair. It may take you 
months to get a fair quotation back. And once they

18:30.282 --> 18:33.565
give you a fair quotation, they want you to do it 
immediately. So that's one of

18:34.321 --> 18:55.350
the

18:34.321 --> 18:55.350
things. hopefully work out with Amtrak. Do you 
think Amtrak was doing that intentionally to

18:58.300 --> 19:02.043
discourage you from? No, I don't think so. I think 
that the main reason Amtrak thought it was

19:03.264 --> 19:14.034
involved in animal expeditions was because they 
realized that the playground chain was a real

19:03.264 --> 19:14.034
problem. Well, let's see. What about the 
possibility of mass transit in Houston being

19:15.815 --> 19:26.485
solved, the problem of mass transit being solved 
by rail? Houston is a very spread out

19:28.000 --> 19:35.530
city. And to make rail viable, it has to be a large

19:35.550 --> 19:52.654
quantity of people, with a mass of people, to do one 
of those buses, and one of them's nice. I

19:52.674 --> 19:54.056
personally voted against metro's rail system. 
Why did you do that? Because I thought it was too

19:54.536 --> 19:55.678
much for two little systems. There are

19:56.215 --> 20:19.778
a lot of

19:56.215 --> 20:19.778
cities that are looking at all kinds of heavy rail, 
such as what Houston is, or a massive transit

19:56.215 --> 20:19.778
system such as New York has. What used to be called 
streetcars is now called light rail. A light rail

20:21.000 --> 20:22.141
system in Houston might work out quite well. 
There's a lot of cities that built new light rail

20:22.161 --> 20:23.502
systems recently. San Diego has one that's 
operationally old. Well,

20:25.055 --> 20:52.142
when

20:25.055 --> 20:52.142
you're looking back

20:53.253 --> 20:56.298
is that rail service was declining in the 60s. Was 
there any alternative to Amtrak to the government

20:56.398 --> 21:01.025
jumping in? Do you think it was right for the 
government to jump in and try to save it? That's a

21:07.575 --> 21:10.399
philosophical question, and it's hard to answer. 
Yes, I think the rail service does do it.

21:18.552 --> 21:20.475
I am not sure. The

21:21.147 --> 21:33.362
old folks can travel.

21:33.382 --> 21:42.633
Well, that's

21:33.382 --> 21:42.633
not really true. Most towns are trying to organize 
it. They have adequate bus service so that if they

21:43.414 --> 21:46.237
lost the passenger train, yes, it might be able to 
use a handful of people, but it's not that. All

21:46.257 --> 21:46.578
right, good. All in the rows.

21:52.028 --> 22:18.281
.

22:18.301 --> 22:18.321
. . . .

22:21.863 --> 22:42.995
Has

22:21.863 --> 22:42.995
there been any

22:21.863 --> 22:42.995
growth in the popularity of the restoration of old 
racing roads? Because you're saying several

22:43.015 --> 22:44.718
different classes of people have been involved in 
cars. Yes. Is that a trend? There are probably more

22:45.179 --> 22:47.282
people in cars running in the United States than 
there were in the United States. Are they

22:47.302 --> 22:48.203
basically rare roads or practically? Yes, 
basically true. There are a number of rare roads. .

23:15.895 --> 23:15.915
. . . . .

23:40.343 --> 23:40.363
. . .

24:03.618 --> 24:03.638
. . . . We got done

24:04.075 --> 24:21.446
in Galveston

24:04.075 --> 24:21.446
recently. We had a steam locomotive going to St. 
Mary's.

24:26.705 --> 24:55.781
And

24:26.705 --> 24:55.781
they know how their space is not going to be out of 
the water. Last year, . So that's another . This

24:56.692 --> 25:24.420
year, we will also have Thank

25:26.273 --> 25:46.678
you.

25:51.333 --> 26:02.963
Thank

25:51.333 --> 26:02.963
you. This

26:04.073 --> 26:32.161
train was restored . That's correct. When it got 
back to Portland .

26:36.946 --> 27:06.598
So

26:36.946 --> 27:06.598
really, There

27:07.203 --> 27:32.653
was a time when the railroads didn't want to deal 
with that. The way they didn't want to deal with

27:32.673 --> 27:34.696
that is now they realize there's more and more 
people involved. There are a lot of problems

27:34.716 --> 27:35.657
associated with it. I

27:36.042 --> 28:02.355
understand that you're a local organization, and 
it's tools for people. Many people nowadays,

28:02.375 --> 28:03.997
especially young children, couldn't afford road 
management. We are looking at a railway industry

28:04.017 --> 28:04.918
as well. I

28:05.354 --> 28:32.442
don't know. Thank

28:34.767 --> 28:39.647
you for coming.
