WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:05.209
in Texas. OK, let me first of all point out, I spent 
one summer in Austin studying under Hugo

00:05.229 --> 00:17.500
Leipziger and getting acquainted with some of the 
faculty. This was in 1947, studying under some of

00:17.520 --> 00:27.650
the faculty there who were in the School of 
Architecture. Individually, there are several

00:27.670 --> 00:30.072
people through the years that seem to have had 
especially strong interest in planning at UT

00:32.380 --> 00:39.931
Austin. Hugo, of course, being one of those. But 
what I have seen at that institution is planning

00:43.136 --> 00:59.299
being pushed to one side, never accepted as either 
an equal partner or a parallel operation compared

01:00.680 --> 01:04.765
to the rest of the program in the School of 
Architecture. That's point one. Point two,

01:07.549 --> 01:29.337
at UT Arlington, very strong dominance by 
architecture faculty over planning, and I think

01:07.549 --> 01:29.337
more so than in Austin, a view being expressed by 
the head of the School of Architecture, that

01:30.177 --> 01:42.754
architects know how to plan, but planners don't 
know how to do architecture. Who was the head? I

01:44.617 --> 01:45.759
don't know who it is now. Box at one time was out 
there. Do you mean Box? Well, Box was one of those.

01:51.286 --> 01:52.748
Of course, he's now at UT Austin. Now at UT Austin, 
that's right. But he was one of the influences. On

01:57.818 --> 02:09.514
the other hand, I must tell you, my daughter, 
Molly, just recently has enrolled in some

01:57.818 --> 02:09.514
architecture courses at UT Arlington. And one of 
the instructors is a person that worked for me when

02:09.795 --> 02:19.509
I had my own private practice in Fort Worth from 69 
until 75. And this person is Dick Ferrier, who's an

02:20.830 --> 02:27.640
excellent illustrator, very talented 
individual. And he commented to Molly how much he

02:28.430 --> 02:47.537
appreciated working in and for a planner in that 
environment as distinguished from working in an

02:28.430 --> 02:47.537
architectural office, which I thought was kind of 
interesting because he made this connection.

02:52.004 --> 02:57.171
I think the thing that has happened

02:58.923 --> 03:26.179
at UT Arlington has perhaps been one more of 
disappointment in the lack of raising the level of

02:58.923 --> 03:26.179
sights of

02:58.923 --> 03:26.179
the academic side, failure to raise the sights of 
community leadership about the contributions,

02:58.923 --> 03:26.179
the potential contributions of planning in the 
local communities. Now let me just share

03:28.225 --> 03:30.588
something by contrast. When Bill Parker, my 
predecessor in Austin, was still a student at UT

03:30.608 --> 03:45.509
Austin, he was out in the field doing, as an 
undergraduate thesis, doing a study in a

03:30.608 --> 03:45.509
community. It was a community up here near Wichita 
Falls. He engendered a lot of positive support for

03:51.036 --> 03:55.963
planning through that. But I don't hear of that, 
haven't heard of that since coming out of students

03:57.580 --> 04:06.509
out of UT Austin. I hate to say it, I haven't heard of 
the students coming out of A&M, but I haven't heard

04:06.529 --> 04:13.776
of the students coming out of Arlington. I don't 
hear of them going out in the summer and doing the

04:13.796 --> 04:27.570
study and getting a lot of community support and 
very positive interest and not making the splash,

04:13.796 --> 04:27.570
but leaving something behind that the people in 
the community can hang their hats on and feel good

04:28.124 --> 04:34.013
about. The only times that I've heard anything, it 
seems to have been more in the nature of a very

04:34.033 --> 04:43.627
academic . Do us a quick and dirty sketch plan. And 
that's not where you build a lot of support across

04:48.855 --> 04:57.928
the state for programs like this. My own feeling is 
that the programs need to be preparing those

04:58.347 --> 05:16.204
students, whether it's in terms of year 
structure, freshman, sophomore, junior,

04:58.347 --> 05:16.204
senior, and then two years of graduate study. But 
they need to be building themselves into a

05:16.925 --> 05:25.873
position where the students get out in an active 
situational context at some point, whether it's

05:27.828 --> 05:39.117
fourth year or graduate year, working on these 
studies. Excuse me, just a minute.

05:43.221 --> 05:48.525
Let me add one additional footnote to all of this in 
terms of my concern. I'm speaking initially here

05:48.545 --> 05:57.733
of the concept of the planning program built into a 
bachelor of city planning.

05:59.384 --> 06:07.352
I think what happened at UT Arlington was this 
concept of urban design taking over. And anybody

06:09.354 --> 06:13.178
who graduated urban design, therefore, was a 
planner. Ergo was a planner. And as I commented to

06:16.142 --> 06:28.935
you a little earlier, Bob, I see people practicing 
architecture, people who are acknowledged

06:29.489 --> 06:59.125
the Dallas community as being good architects 
whose work, when you look at it on the ground from

06:29.489 --> 06:59.125
the outside, do not reflect an understanding of 
the relationships of the building to the

06:29.489 --> 06:59.125
landscape to the circulation patterns for 
pedestrians on site to automobiles on site, even

06:29.489 --> 06:59.125
use the hotel where you were staying. do not 
understand what motivates people to act as they

06:59.240 --> 07:08.509
do, like where they park. And we have a classic 
example up the street here where everybody's

07:08.529 --> 07:13.393
parking along a main thoroughfare. Rather than 
driving in and getting at their front door,

07:13.854 --> 07:21.861
they're coming in the back door just because it 
happens to be close to the thoroughfare. Things

07:22.902 --> 07:29.128
such as that that are a recognition of lack 
consideration of the sociology, the human scale,

07:29.395 --> 07:40.408
the motivational things that affect people. 
Activity patterns. Activity patterns, yes. The

07:44.653 --> 07:52.342
whole way people live is not, outside the building 
is not seen as something to be considered. It's

07:52.962 --> 07:56.266
only what's inside the building. And you take care 
of these other things in a maybe in a sophisticated

07:59.348 --> 08:09.500
appearance way, but you don't take care of them in 
terms of the generic operation of that little

07:59.348 --> 08:09.500
community of people. So the double car garage is 
converted to a storeroom. Right. And we have all

08:14.345 --> 08:16.708
the cars parked out in the driveway. All around the 
street. Simply because people find that that's

08:19.491 --> 08:24.717
really where they want to be. And nobody thought 
about where these people are going to park.

08:28.261 --> 08:28.782
There's no I guess my concern here is that 
negatively, because the schools of architecture

08:30.584 --> 08:53.211
don't seem to deal with the problems of 
out-of-building activities and what motivates

08:30.584 --> 08:53.211
human beings out of the building, they frankly do a 
lot of damage, particularly in site planning. But

08:53.231 --> 08:56.355
that spills over into the larger domain of what 
happens when you dump traffic on streets and where

08:56.808 --> 09:04.136
people are going for their shopping and all of the 
other things. In terms of undergraduate

09:04.637 --> 09:10.304
programs, and you pointed out, you do not have an 
undergraduate program in city planning. But I

09:11.405 --> 09:26.342
think that one of our failures is the lack of a good, 
solid foundation program that will lead students

09:11.405 --> 09:26.342
into a two-year graduate program in planning. And 
I don't see it as anything less than a two-year

09:30.533 --> 09:37.079
professional degree program. I think it has to be 
that. You mentioned that at A&M, that, in essence,

09:40.963 --> 09:45.247
is what you have in the students. You have this 
field experience requirement, the internship. I

09:51.693 --> 09:54.456
think that's essential in a graduate program. I 
don't see that it can be any other way. But if

10:00.406 --> 10:25.793
anybody is going to be telling folks, when you come 
out of a design school at the undergraduate level,

10:00.406 --> 10:25.793
you are prepared to be a planner, then I would want 
to look very closely at the design of that

10:00.406 --> 10:25.793
curriculum to find out whether they are getting 
some understanding of all of these human elements

10:26.262 --> 10:29.385
that are involved. And most design schools don't 
want to relinquish that time so that those human

10:29.405 --> 10:38.115
elements are going to be adequately discussed. 
There's not, other than a student accidentally in

10:38.556 --> 10:54.413
an undergraduate program taking a course in 
psychology, one course maybe, or one or two

10:38.556 --> 10:54.413
courses in sociology, or maybe taking beyond the 
required state government course of course, in

10:54.815 --> 10:57.259
local government. Other than that, they don't get 
much that says, here is the in which this planning

10:57.279 --> 11:07.133
activity goes on. It's kind of, to me, as if the 
message that Patrick Geddes made years and years

11:09.316 --> 11:23.657
ago from his outlook tower in Edinburgh, you have 
to look at the total picture. You can't do your

11:24.565 --> 11:29.992
design in the absence of the total picture. Now, 
this is what made me wonder initially when I first

11:30.012 --> 11:45.291
took a look at the planning in Anchorage and then 
later on the planning in Fort Worth, the sector

11:30.012 --> 11:45.291
approach. Because I had severe questions. 
professionally about the success of the sector

11:50.722 --> 12:20.121
approach and if it would indeed be compatible with 
a comprehensive approach okay let me respond to

11:50.722 --> 12:20.121
that because I think we did some things there that 
did show compatibility one was that as

11:50.722 --> 12:20.121
recommendations came in from the sector councils 
the sector planning councils Who led those? These

12:22.375 --> 12:36.350
were the

12:22.375 --> 12:36.350
staff assisted, but really the people in that 
sector were the ones who identified what they saw

12:22.375 --> 12:36.350
as their critical problems. The staff responded 
and said, all right, here are your problems, here

12:36.991 --> 12:45.460
are your alternatives in dealing with this, and 
here are the consequences of alternatives. Then

12:45.840 --> 12:47.762
the people thrashed through the process Is this 
better or is this better or is this better? And they

12:50.850 --> 12:55.416
would come back then and say, for our sector, here 
is what we would like to see. That was a

12:56.057 --> 12:58.120
recommendation of the Planning Commission. So 
the staff then operated more or less like a

12:58.140 --> 13:01.745
secretariat. A technical secretariat that also 
was the transmission line for information and

13:02.325 --> 13:17.665
that the sector planning councils could and did 
repeatedly ask for technical information.

13:18.016 --> 13:30.155
whether it was in transportation, whether it was 
in parks, open space, whether it was in housing,

13:18.016 --> 13:30.155
whether it was in commercial industrial, 
whatever, commercial generators, whatever. So

13:30.175 --> 13:34.141
it was a constant two-way street. But the results 
of that went to the planning commission. And the

13:39.209 --> 13:46.420
commission said, this fits within the guidelines 
or the principles that we have adopted. about

13:46.703 --> 13:50.187
circulation, about open space, about housing. We 
want you, staff, to go back and inform the Sector

13:52.029 --> 14:06.204
Planning Council that we find these principles 
being satisfied, these concepts acceptable, but

13:52.029 --> 14:06.204
here's one that we can't buy. And here's why we 
can't buy it. Because the adjoining sector has a

14:09.748 --> 14:15.214
different set of constraints or problems to deal 
with. Whatever it might be. asked them to go

14:18.040 --> 14:25.810
through that and explain to them what these 
problems are in this other sector. Through that

14:25.830 --> 14:33.320
process, there was a lot of sharing and there were 
some changes in things. But let me tell you, the one

14:33.340 --> 14:46.056
thing that has been very successful in that 
program,

14:33.340 --> 14:46.056
sector one, which is the TCU area, and it was chosen 
purely by happenstance, The Sector Planning

14:48.213 --> 14:55.123
Council in that sector began in 1967 or 68. 68,

14:55.143 --> 15:04.518
I guess.

15:04.538 --> 15:06.741
Those people are still identified. They identify 
themselves as members of the Sector Planning

15:08.403 --> 15:12.289
Council. And they, either in a large group or with 
representatives will appear at the city council

15:18.318 --> 15:25.106
meetings and say, we represent the sector 
planning council from sector one. Here is what we

15:26.127 --> 15:29.030
recommended in the plan. Here's what the planning 
commission adopted. And here's what we expect you

15:31.073 --> 15:33.495
to live up to. Have you found that the sector 
planning councils have ever been an incubation

15:34.256 --> 15:47.551
mechanism for rising politicals or people? Oh, 
yes. Yes, it did. In fact, it was very interesting.

15:52.321 --> 16:17.552
In the first two sectors,

15:52.321 --> 16:17.552
the city council member from that sector, who 
happened to live in that sector, wherever it might

15:52.321 --> 16:17.552
have been, the county commissioner who happened 
to live in that sector, the school board member who

15:52.321 --> 16:17.552
happened to live in that sector, they would always 
show up at sector planning council meetings. And I

16:24.663 --> 16:28.007
talked with a couple of those people, and they told 
me this. They said, in essence, it came down to, we

16:28.388 --> 16:48.990
feel not an obligation to be here, but as people who 
are elected to represent maybe the city at large at

16:28.388 --> 16:48.990
that time or who live in this area or do represent a 
district here, we feel it's our obligation to be

16:49.409 --> 16:54.614
here and to keep on top of what these people are 
saying. Otherwise, we cannot represent them.

16:57.997 --> 17:01.600
Like Martin Meyerson said, it's sort of a 
pulse-taking operation. Right. And it was more

17:02.401 --> 17:03.702
than that. It was more than that, because they 
would also infuse information about what was

17:03.722 --> 17:14.471
financially possible, what the constraints were 
on city or county or school district. They could do

17:14.531 --> 17:15.432
that. And they could do it. And they could do it 
authoritatively.

17:19.970 --> 17:22.273
And the people knew these were our neighbors. So 
there was a high level of acceptance. Now, in the

17:26.818 --> 17:36.669
later sectors, I don't know how successful that 
involvement was or how extensive it was, but I do

17:26.818 --> 17:36.669
know it worked in the first couple sectors, very 
much so. I suppose it would depend on resident

17:36.689 --> 17:40.213
leadership. Right. In answer to one of your 
questions, though, about the sectors, in sector

17:41.074 --> 17:48.863
one, which was the TCU area, We actually, as a 
result of the involvement of the people, changed

17:49.113 --> 18:10.934
the boundaries of the sector because there was an 
area east of TCU that said, these were the people

17:49.113 --> 18:10.934
speaking in this area, we do not belong in that 
sector. We belong in the south sector. We have more

18:15.158 --> 18:18.681
that we are. compatible with in terms of ideas and 
concerns and needs with people who are two miles to

18:19.657 --> 18:30.928
the east of us than with people who are two blocks to 
the west of us. And so the Sector Planning Council

18:31.668 --> 18:38.615
in that case voted to recommend back to the 
Planning Commission that the boundaries be

18:31.668 --> 18:38.615
changed. And so they weren't, the sector 
boundaries weren't precise lines. They wound up

18:47.298 --> 18:53.524
showing this precise lines on the map, but they 
were conceptual lines, if you would. They were

18:53.544 --> 18:58.308
corridors more than anything else, sort of gray 
zones around the sectors. And to that extent, I

18:59.149 --> 19:05.015
think the sector planning approach has been very 
successful. If nothing else, the fact that it has

19:05.035 --> 19:16.225
kept people for 15 and 20 years involved in their 
community, where before that they were speaking

19:05.035 --> 19:16.225
as one, they then felt they had a group that was 
knowledgeable, that had gone through a lot of

19:17.032 --> 19:30.686
discussion, spent many, many hours arguing pros 
and cons on issues, and that they could speak with

19:17.032 --> 19:30.686
authority. It sounds like a substantially 
different experience than what happened in

19:30.706 --> 19:38.593
Austin with the neighborhood planning council. 
Oh, yes. Yeah. I don't think there's anything

19:40.315 --> 19:44.379
comparable in the Austin experience. Well, there 
was. Initially, but this large... Yes, and

19:50.679 --> 20:04.140
largely this then was bypassed by staff, much to 
the chagrin of people like Joan Bartz and so forth,

19:50.679 --> 20:04.140
who was president of the neighborhood councils. 
It ended up with the Austin Tomorrow Plan, which

20:05.522 --> 20:14.916
was a non-plan, and had to... be given redirection 
by the governing body, the city council, because

20:15.740 --> 20:23.349
there was no plan diagram. All it was was a word 
plan. And now, of course, with the departure of

20:26.253 --> 20:44.194
Dick Lilly, the new directors, of course, they 
have two planning departments now, have been

20:26.253 --> 20:44.194
directed to move ahead with the formulation of a 
comprehensive plan for Austin.

20:44.731 --> 20:46.633
What do you think of them apples? So we'll just have 
to see what comes out of it all. I guess one of the

20:52.801 --> 21:14.147
things I would say about Austin is that they may not 
have, and I don't know what the scale was on their

20:52.801 --> 21:14.147
neighborhood planning councils, but it may well 
have been that what we saw in Fort Worth was

21:14.684 --> 21:17.747
multiple neighborhoods forming a sector. I see. 
Austin, in other words, I guess if you translate

21:20.329 --> 21:33.922
that into Austin, it would be all of the east side 
from the inter-regional highway all the way out

21:20.329 --> 21:33.922
would be a sector. They may have split that into 
several units. And when you do that, then we were

21:38.646 --> 21:42.750
talking basically in Fort Worth of communities of 
a minimum of 50,000 population as a sector. That

21:50.866 --> 22:00.841
was kind of a ballpark figure, unless it was 
essentially undeveloped area, in which case the

21:50.866 --> 22:00.841
50,000 was still seen as a projected total 
population. That was a minimum, 50,000, 60,000,

22:00.882 --> 22:05.649
70,000 as the population area. Well, that's a 
good-sized community. Oh, yeah. That's a lot

22:08.954 --> 22:10.736
different than a neighborhood. Oh, yeah. So that 
may have been part of the difference. Coming back

22:16.084 --> 22:20.950
to the programs and planning, the other thing I 
would say is this.

22:23.773 --> 22:40.733
The universities,

22:23.773 --> 22:40.733
you and I have talked about the idea, and frankly, I 
agree with it because of my own experience at East

22:23.773 --> 22:40.733
Texas State, the universities, I think, need to 
get together on their planning programs. I think

22:46.999 --> 22:48.861
they need to do it in a couple of ways. One is, and I 
speak here primarily of the graduate programs,

22:49.561 --> 23:11.563
one is to identify a common core of courses that 
students might take at any one of the three schools

22:49.561 --> 23:11.563
and that would be acceptable at any one of the three 
schools, speaking of UT, Austin, and A&M, and UT

23:11.982 --> 23:18.888
Arlington. This we're trying to do in the adult 
continuing ed program at TWU North Texas, East

23:20.710 --> 23:25.414
Texas. And we're going to be successful. I have no 
doubt about it. It may take a time before that can be

23:31.960 --> 23:41.668
accomplished, but I think that there is much for 
the three universities that have planning

23:31.960 --> 23:41.668
programs you gain from studying the federation of 
North Texas area universities

23:42.273 --> 23:59.272
in terms of how the graduate programs can be 
federated to the mutual advantage of the

23:42.273 --> 23:59.272
universities and the students. For example, the 
location of A&M is hardly what you'd call urban

24:01.634 --> 24:08.121
oriented. Oh, no. And we are under continuing 
disadvantage in not only attracting students to

24:08.767 --> 24:24.505
the campus because of that, but also in our 
outreach programs and our community service

24:08.767 --> 24:24.505
programs and our lab work. And it would be far more 
useful if these students could be located in their

24:25.887 --> 24:35.218
second year in an urban environment. Sure. It 
wouldn't matter much where they were located in

24:35.935 --> 24:40.482
their first year. That's right. For the basic 
courses, I don't see that it makes an awful lot of

24:42.705 --> 24:53.181
difference because those are essentially 
internally oriented. But the externally

24:54.683 --> 25:03.276
oriented courses, they really need to have the 
opportunity to see what happens on the ground. I'm

25:04.117 --> 25:34.022
not, I guess the one thing that gives me concern 
there is that the planning agencies in the state,

25:04.117 --> 25:34.022
the city planning agencies, don't have, they're 
not the best work environment because of somewhat

25:04.117 --> 25:34.022
being fraught with some political pressures that 
are totally external and therefore having some

25:04.117 --> 25:34.022
real problems that way and the other is just a, 
maybe not having the strength that they ought to in

25:35.032 --> 25:38.676
city government. Those kinds of things bother me. 
But there's no reason that students from the three

25:42.079 --> 25:55.552
schools could not be assigned to work in given 
localities in a summer internship or in a long

25:42.079 --> 25:55.552
term. I see even the possibility if the graduate 
programs in planning were coupled with a graduate

26:04.951 --> 26:27.539
program in urban studies, for example, or a 
graduate program in geography,

26:04.951 --> 26:27.539
or a graduate program in sociology, not social 
work, but sociology, that students could not be

26:04.951 --> 26:27.539
put together in teams out in the field. One of my 
concerns and it has been a longstanding concern,

26:33.250 --> 26:47.069
is that too many people who are identified as 
professional planners come only out of a design

26:33.250 --> 26:47.069
background and know nothing else. Academically, 
they don't have any other orientation.

26:55.761 --> 27:00.928
I've been in a very fortunate position in various 
places where I've worked. I'm hiring people who

27:01.668 --> 27:09.097
are geographers, and I look for geographers to 
hire. I've hired people who are sociologists, and

27:09.898 --> 27:21.393
I look for either sociology or economics as the 
primary background of individuals. I've looked

27:22.695 --> 27:30.865
for people who have been engineers, not planners, 
but engineers who would have some understanding

27:22.695 --> 27:30.865
of the mechanisms of the community. Frankly, so 
I'd have somebody to counterbalance

27:31.688 --> 27:39.876
the engineering advice coming from public works 
departments and places like that. I've looked for

27:42.218 --> 27:47.083
people who really had a background in public 
administration. In fact, when I was in Fort Worth,

27:47.103 --> 27:56.151
I hired a fellow who had his PhD from Indiana in 
public administration. An excellent person.

28:01.523 --> 28:03.985
I felt very good about it. He was constantly 
generating ideas and helping loosen up the whole

28:04.025 --> 28:10.411
staff. Helped me tremendously.

28:14.454 --> 28:21.100
But I don't see the planning programs trying to get 
their students to hook into individuals like

28:14.454 --> 28:21.100
that. One of my best experiences in graduate 
school was at Oklahoma when I was teamed up with a

28:22.101 --> 28:30.568
fellow who was doing graduate work in 
architecture at OU. And he was interested in some

28:35.020 --> 28:45.154
regional issues and the implication of some 
regional issues for planning and architecture.

28:45.174 --> 28:47.797
He got assigned to my team. Two of us were a team 
doing things together. It was great. It was

28:52.443 --> 28:54.266
absolutely great. And I found that a very, very 
rewarding experience. Jack Schultz, he was in

29:00.653 --> 29:04.698
Tulsa one time. In fact, for many years he was in 
Tulsa.

29:19.776 --> 29:22.480
Bob, let me back up for a moment. Now that it's the 
next morning, I'd like to just reflect on a couple

29:23.220 --> 29:27.185
of things. When I was in... Austin, the person who 
served for several years as assistant planning

29:30.573 --> 29:52.084
director was Bob Green, Robert Green, who was very 
well liked by staff and had a landscape

29:30.573 --> 29:52.084
architecture background from the University of 
Western Mass. And he then left and went on to work in

29:53.045 --> 29:59.635
San Antonio. The other two individuals that I 
neglected to mention were people in Fort Worth.

30:08.192 --> 30:18.364
Alvin Marsden, who came from the University of 
Washington as an architect, he had come in to our

30:08.192 --> 30:18.364
staff. And he was very good in terms of stimulating 
some design concepts in connection with planning

30:28.943 --> 30:33.068
efforts for Fort Worth. The other person was Ruben 
D. Ramirez, who was also a product of University of

30:33.568 --> 30:47.305
Washington, who likewise did a good deal in the 
area of design. Al Marsden returned to Washington

30:49.247 --> 30:58.798
during the time period before I left the city of 
Fort Worth. Ruben Ramirez went to Albuquerque as

30:59.757 --> 31:20.901
head of the planning department up there and then 
later returned to the Dallas-Fort Worth area and

30:59.757 --> 31:20.901
is currently in practice in the Dallas area. Those 
also are perhaps contacts you might want to make.

31:27.365 --> 31:41.043
Well, a little bit further beyond the Fort Worth 
experience, in my own private practice, I did

31:27.365 --> 31:41.043
planning work in conjunction with.

31:41.063 --> 31:42.946
Pardon the interruption. In my own private 
practice, in conjunction with some engineering

31:44.068 --> 31:54.081
firms and other firms in landscape architecture, 
did a series of planning studies in towns
