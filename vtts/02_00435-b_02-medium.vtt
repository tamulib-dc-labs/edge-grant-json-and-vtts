WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:06.897
And these are local Chinese artists who come on and 
perform for you at the base occasionally. And

00:07.358 --> 00:18.831
subsequently, when we got in combat, of course, 
the mayor would come out and give us special

00:07.358 --> 00:18.831
honors. On one occasion,

00:19.832 --> 00:30.004
the first fight we had where we repulsed an enemy 
attack of 14 bombers, from hitting Kunming. We

00:33.385 --> 00:36.089
turned them around before they ever got to the 
city. And of course, the city heard about that. And

00:37.971 --> 00:40.895
they came out the following about two days after. 
It was a great party. And the Generalissimo sent

00:43.698 --> 00:58.877
one of his emissaries up and wrapped a, he, each one 
of us got a, it was a sort of a red scarf, which mean

00:59.549 --> 01:01.151
something to them in China. I still don't know what 
it means, but it's something very dear, and it's a

01:01.191 --> 01:10.060
great honor to get a red scarf, and gave each one of 
the pilots one of these. Subsequently, of course,

01:10.100 --> 01:12.823
some of us got medals. The Chinese military, oh, 
man, they just, they were particularly Chinese,

01:13.703 --> 01:22.272
what, reminiscent of the Chinese Air Force. They 
just loved us. We never...

01:28.827 --> 01:34.935
We flew a few missions toward the latter part of our 
tour. Let's say around April or May of 43, the

01:35.536 --> 01:43.906
Chinese manned Russian bombers. There was about 
15, 20 old Russian light bombers from the Chinese

01:44.167 --> 01:49.273
crew. And we'd escort them. Many times, we'd have 
to navigate them to the target. Otherwise, they'd

01:56.282 --> 01:57.484
never got there. In one case, we did this on Hanoi. 
See, that was Japanese occupied. Yeah, I know.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.076
We'll get to that. Now, did Chiang Kai-shek ever, 
did he ever come down and talk to you? Did you ever

02:10.362 --> 02:11.664
get a chance to meet him? Chiang Kai-shek visited 
Steele one time, and then I say this with hindsight

02:14.188 --> 02:20.758
now.

02:23.141 --> 02:25.885
Chiang Kai-shek was no more than one of the biggest 
dictators in China. At the time, of course, he was

02:30.731 --> 02:36.520
in a deadlock fight with Mao Zedong and the 
communists. That didn't mean much to me in those

02:37.241 --> 02:39.284
days. I never even thought of such things as that. 
To me, he was China. Chiang Kai-shek and Oman were

02:43.690 --> 02:45.613
China. And we had a great deal of respect for them. 
And he visited us at the field one day. Of course, we

02:51.361 --> 02:52.823
had to go to Chennault. But I happened to be up 
around headquarters in Atlanta. He got out of an

02:54.966 --> 02:57.610
old Goonie Bird. DC-3, but before he stepped out, 
at least five or ten so-called Secret Service

02:57.809 --> 03:18.112
people, if you will, in Chinese uniforms, with 
pistols drawn out in their hand, pulled out of

02:57.809 --> 03:18.112
their holsters at ready, stepped off the airplane 
and then gathered around a circle, and then the

02:57.809 --> 03:18.112
generalissimo got off. He always wore his 
uniform. Every time I saw him, he wore his uniform,

03:20.715 --> 03:23.698
and got off.

03:26.108 --> 03:28.491
Of course, I just happened to see him then. I have 
never spoken personally to Gisimo. I never did

03:31.014 --> 03:32.576
speak to him personally. I've seen him at 
banquets, and I've been maybe 10 or 15 feet from

03:32.596 --> 03:41.006
him, but I've never spoken to him personally or 
shook hands with him. Madam, I have. I've talked

03:42.048 --> 03:45.512
with her in conversation. Very charming person. 
Tell me, what were your opinions of both of these

03:46.974 --> 03:49.938
people? Well, my opinion of Gisimo was strictly 
from... stories I'd heard of him from two or three

03:55.353 --> 04:03.786
times I saw him at a short distance, and from his 
pictures. I'm stating my opinion strictly based

04:06.189 --> 04:16.685
on mostly from what I read and understood and 
picked up from some people who were authoritative

04:06.189 --> 04:16.685
and some who were not. He definitely was the 
biggest, one of the biggest warlords of China. And

04:23.348 --> 04:26.632
of course, marrying a madam, he married money. She 
was related to the Soom family. And so with his

04:31.078 --> 04:39.648
power, military power, and authority, and her 
money, he was the number one man. From stories I

04:41.611 --> 04:51.583
heard, he was very

04:41.611 --> 04:51.583
capable in dealing with foreigners. over the 
bargaining table, a la Len Leith. He was a good

04:56.827 --> 04:57.869
strategist. He was definitely, definitely a 
military man. He was much more of a strategist on

05:01.454 --> 05:05.079
the planet than he was a tactician. How good an 
administrator he was, I don't know. His wife...

05:08.344 --> 05:12.030
Did Chennault ever say anything about him? These 
are some of the stories that I... The reason I say

05:14.774 --> 05:20.743
based on stories I've heard, Chennault had a 
fantastic respect for him, but I think The main

05:21.432 --> 05:29.960
reason Chennault had a fantastic respect for him 
is because, in effect, he was the Generalissimo's

05:21.432 --> 05:29.960
number one air power advisor. Very close to him. 
And vice versa. Seeing the capabilities

05:35.546 --> 05:40.751
Chennault had, the Generalissimo had a great 
respect for him. So there was a terrific mutual

05:40.811 --> 05:45.376
respect between the two of them. I'm sure 
Chennault thought he was a great man. I don't know

05:50.727 --> 05:53.591
enough about him to say yes or no. He was an 
impressive person.

05:57.817 --> 06:02.783
If I would say at a bargaining table, I would say 
that the madam could get as much as he could. She was

06:03.364 --> 06:11.154
very charming and very capable and could speak 
English well enough. Very good, as a matter of

06:11.174 --> 06:13.838
fact. And she was very influential with President 
Roosevelt. So was the Generalissimo. As a matter

06:23.009 --> 06:41.152
of fact, in subsequent head-to-head fights, if 
you will, over who was going to control the AVG,

06:23.009 --> 06:41.152
which was eventually coming in the Air Force, 
Chenault always had the Generalissimo behind

06:23.009 --> 06:41.152
him, vis-a-vis Hap Arnold. In other words, Hap 
Arnold wanted it. Oh, yes. And Chenault wanted it,

06:43.715 --> 06:45.638
too. Hap Arnold and Chenault hated each other's 
guts, period. and they fought like cats and dogs.

06:54.782 --> 07:10.421
Of course, as many things are, he was compromised, 
and Chenault was given his reserve commission

06:54.782 --> 07:10.421
back in the Air Force and made a Brigadier General 
and ultimately a two-star general and three

06:54.782 --> 07:10.421
stars. And of course, when he was given this title, 
of course, he was also commander of the newly

07:18.275 --> 07:26.583
established 14th Air Force, which was in China, 
per se, and which also took the old emblem of the

07:18.275 --> 07:26.583
Flying Tigers. That's where you always see the 
Flying Tigers at the 14th Air Force.

07:34.671 --> 07:40.798
Now, did you ever hear anything about Mao Zedong or 
ever have any thoughts about him whatsoever while

07:34.671 --> 07:40.798
you were there? I've thought about that a lot. 
since, and knowing as much about it as I do now, and

07:43.604 --> 07:53.034
watching history unfold, I don't ever recall 
hearing Mao Zedong. It seems that I do recall bits

07:53.154 --> 08:01.283
of discussion about so-called red Chinese 
communists. And I do know that I remember stories

08:01.303 --> 08:12.615
of, you know, there'd be convoys of trucks coming 
up the Burmese trail from, Rangoon to Kunming, and

08:13.203 --> 08:18.429
eventually on up to Chongqing. But there were many 
stories, and I'm sure this is true, subsequently

08:18.809 --> 08:41.995
I've heard stories that proved to be true, that in 
these convoys, as the convoys would get over into

08:18.809 --> 08:41.995
China from Burma across the border, maybe every 
third or fourth, maybe have it flat and drop out,

08:42.548 --> 08:45.092
convoy and had to fix it, and then he'd never show 
up. He'd turn off and go back up the hills, and that

08:45.152 --> 08:55.249
truck load of arms, maybe if you will, like rifles 
and stuff, would eventually trickle into Mount

08:45.152 --> 08:55.249
Titone. And some of this was just pure fraud and 
sabotage, if you will, the Chinese getting his

08:55.269 --> 09:05.045
cover shot, in other words, getting his tips, 
which is typical of the Far East. I saw that in

09:05.065 --> 09:08.050
Thailand later on, by the way. And so it might have 
been Mao, and it might not have been Mao. A lot of

09:11.852 --> 09:15.497
land lease equipment, I am sure, went to Mao 
Zedong. I'm sure of that. Or it might have gone to

09:17.359 --> 09:18.881
another warlord? No, it had to be either 
Generalissimo or Mao Zedong, one of the two. But

09:28.195 --> 09:33.101
you never really heard much about him, except you 
heard about the Red Chinese. OK. So much for Mao.

09:36.366 --> 09:38.509
Let's move to regulations. said before that there 
was a club, but it wasn't an officer's club, it

09:39.299 --> 09:44.566
wasn't an enlisted club. What was the 
relationship between the men who had been former

09:44.626 --> 09:50.855
sergeants or enlisted men and the ones who had been 
former officers? Were they all treated as equal

09:50.875 --> 09:53.839
first-man bases or what? We had two hostels in 
Kunming.

10:03.127 --> 10:11.915
The big one in town proper, away from the field, was 
really the AVG headquarters, where General

10:03.127 --> 10:11.915
Chernoff lived. There were dormitories there for 
officers, well, pilots, if you will, and the

10:11.936 --> 10:23.006
maintenance people, airmen, if you will. They 
lived together and had the same aid together. Over

10:26.650 --> 10:32.155
in our hostel at the, where my particular squad, 
the first of the pilots were in one hostel, the

10:26.650 --> 10:32.155
maintenance men were in the other. They were all in 
the same house. And my hostel, which was right on

10:34.234 --> 10:42.083
the field proper, practically on the field, 
adjacent to the field, but the first squadron

10:34.234 --> 10:42.083
hostel, if you will. We had our club. We had our 
mess, where the airmen and the officers, polished

10:43.484 --> 10:49.511
so-called, got together. Now, because all of us 
were recruited military people, and if you will,

10:49.531 --> 11:00.623
experienced military people, most of us, We had it 
ingrained in us a little bit about the aloofness

11:01.379 --> 11:06.285
between officers and airmen. So we didn't mix as 
freely as you would think. For instance, getting

11:09.449 --> 11:21.584
an officer in the club, the airmen, 95% of them 
mostly, would get over in their corner and have

11:09.449 --> 11:21.584
their drinks in discussion, whereas the pilots 
get over in the other corner. Even when you sat down

11:21.764 --> 11:25.148
to eat, it'd be more or less like this. But there was 
no specific requirement saying we had to be

11:25.589 --> 11:30.475
separated. We just sort of followed what was 
traditional in military units. As time went on,

11:38.410 --> 11:49.087
this characteristic sort of mellowed into one 
where we mixed much more freely and had poker games

11:38.410 --> 11:49.087
together. And I've even seen the pilots and the 
airmen getting in fights and jugging melees

11:49.227 --> 11:56.158
together. it mattered towards you, particularly 
when we got in combat. And did the enlisted men call

11:59.569 --> 12:02.472
the pilots, sir? No, none of that. Matter of fact, 
at times I got worried about what would happen with

12:04.835 --> 12:09.701
our discipline, you know. Yeah, I love that. I got 
worried about, well, now, are we going to turn into

12:10.822 --> 12:16.288
one of these so-called mercenary outfits where we 
just go to hell? I got a little concerned at times.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.512
I'd have discussions with Chenault. I had 
personally had discussions with Chenault about

12:19.532 --> 12:24.357
this, and he wasn't worried about it. He 
appreciated my interest in it, but he says, I think

12:25.062 --> 12:28.308
you're overworked. I don't think it's a good 
thing. When we get in combat, you'll see all these

12:30.912 --> 12:34.097
problems disappear. You won't hear any of this 
bitching and crap. And he was so right. He was. Yes,

12:37.744 --> 12:39.466
sir.

12:41.490 --> 12:48.201
A outfit that's not doing anything, that's not 
busily engaged, is apt to get into trouble. The old

12:48.682 --> 12:50.445
story you heard, you know, For instance, guys sit 
over in the corner and vote and worry about him, but

12:51.067 --> 12:59.417
the guys all around bitch and don't worry about 
him. When we were heavily involved in training in

12:59.437 --> 13:10.830
the earlier days at Canggu, we didn't have any 
great problems, but there was no comparison when

12:59.437 --> 13:10.830
we got to combat. There was no problem at all. It's 
hard for a person to believe that you throw a bunch

13:19.687 --> 13:34.650
of people like this together and see them or hear 
about them operating so efficiently and smoothly

13:19.687 --> 13:34.650
as we did in our combat operations when we got 
involved in combat. I brought my airplane down

13:34.790 --> 13:39.256
plenty of holes and bullet holes. The next day, 
boy, at 7 o'clock when I went out there to get that

13:39.276 --> 13:48.951
airplane, rev up the engine and get it ready, give 
it a pre-flight check, those holes were patched.

13:49.403 --> 13:51.185
overnight and done well. So those maintenance men 
were really part of the team. That's right, and

13:54.009 --> 14:03.121
they were backed up by these Chinese coolies that 
could do the menial and hard labor. But remember

14:03.681 --> 14:08.247
now, we had the elite of the airmen. For instance, 
we'd have something wrong with the engine

14:08.287 --> 14:15.276
wouldn't be running right. My maintenance man 
would take my carburetor off that engine, and in no

14:18.682 --> 14:27.271
time flat he'd have it completely spread all over 
the bench, you know, tear it to pieces. It's

14:27.351 --> 14:28.152
unheard of. And the Red Ground fit me on the States 
Air Force. But, you know, no 1st or 2nd National

14:31.576 --> 14:36.421
Line maintenance, all that stuff, you know. He'd 
have to take it apart to find what's wrong with it,

14:36.441 --> 14:42.588
put it back together, and make it go ahead and run it 
beautifully. It's just an outstanding mechanic.

14:44.810 --> 14:45.110
Right. He was trained. And some things, you know, 
born out of necessity, you learn to fix. Now,

14:52.575 --> 15:09.219
admit, some of our parts on the airplane were 
probably put together with, let's say, maybe a

14:52.575 --> 15:09.219
brass boat rather than a steel boat, but, you know, 
it's held together, that type of thing. But I often

15:09.239 --> 15:16.549
think back, and as a matter of fact, some of my 
buddies get together maybe at a reunion, and How in

15:17.221 --> 15:21.005
the hell did we do that? But we did it. I have. So 
there's no breakdown in it. No. Discipline

15:26.911 --> 15:27.993
whatsoever. No. Well, no. Really, the answer is 
no. You can't think of any? No. Oh, there's some

15:36.201 --> 15:37.563
little instance. Oh, yeah. Matter of fact, Peppy 
Boynton, Greg Boynton, Black Sheep Boy. No. Was

15:44.913 --> 15:45.594
he? Pappy was in my squadron. I know him very well. 
Oh, really? I'm probably one of the very few guys in

15:48.979 --> 15:57.974
AVG, Flying Tigers, that Pappy Boynton never got 
in a fight with. Really? Pappy tried his best at

15:58.895 --> 16:03.302
times to get me in a fight. And it might very well be 
that that's the reason I'm living today, because

16:03.322 --> 16:11.615
he was quite a big boy, but not that I was afraid of 
him. As a matter of fact, I have. on top of Pappy

16:12.993 --> 16:18.219
Boynton, holding him down in a grump and stupor. 
And Pappy and I today are the closest friends.

16:22.543 --> 16:24.285
Where does he live now? I think he's out in 
California. I think California. But anyway, tell

16:29.571 --> 16:32.254
me, he was just a pugnacious type? Oh, very 
pugnacious. Pappy's biggest, and he admitted it,

16:34.136 --> 16:36.498
was a bottle. Matter of fact, that's where he left 
the Marine Corps. He knew he might as well. He was a

16:40.282 --> 16:42.004
terrific man as an individual. a terrific pilot as 
an individual. But as a flight leader over there,

16:46.518 --> 16:55.770
he lost several of the airplanes by lack of 
navigation or something. He just never did get off

16:56.772 --> 17:03.280
on the right foot in Flying Tigers, and mainly 
because he arrived drinking and stayed drinking.

17:03.761 --> 17:09.628
As a matter of fact, he was dishonored and 
discharged from the Flying Tigers, you know. And

17:10.529 --> 17:13.273
he left China on a Air Transport, United States Air 
Force Air Transport Command B-24 when he wasn't

17:14.283 --> 17:23.435
supposed to, and the pilot that took him out didn't 
know it. But Chenault had put out strict orders

17:23.956 --> 17:29.242
when he was drawn back into the Air Force. Under no 
conditions will an Air Force aircraft take this

17:29.263 --> 17:32.727
man out of China. He was getting ready for it. This 
is not well-known, but it's true. But

17:37.934 --> 17:44.062
subsequently, old Pappy, you know, went back 
home, got back in the Marine Corps, and did a, well,

17:37.934 --> 17:44.062
he got the Medal of Honor. Mm-hmm. He's a pretty 
combat man, but he's like some of those typical

17:45.451 --> 17:50.878
people. In time of war, you've got to have them, but 
in time of peace, what are you doing? A la Patton, a

17:58.930 --> 18:03.135
la some of the other people. Yeah, that's the best 
example. But he does want to pick a fight with them.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.747
That's always when he's tight. Sure. But I still 
think that he was a good man. He just didn't get

18:18.683 --> 18:21.291
along well over there. He got up on the wrong foot. 
But Chenault had the, he could discharge people. I

18:28.409 --> 18:30.772
mean, what, you mean he'd just fire you? Because 
you were not in a military unit, per se. Oh, yeah, he

18:33.997 --> 18:34.858
fired them. He just fired you. He didn't discharge 
you. Well. How could he give you dishonor? Well,

18:39.284 --> 18:41.387
you see, I'm talking about times after. This was 
after the ABG was. Okay, part of the U.S. Army.

18:45.373 --> 18:51.402
Chenault was inducted back into the service 
before the ABG was disbanded. Well, yeah, he came

18:51.787 --> 19:01.517
back, he was, Chenault had just got inducted back 
into service probably, I'd say in April or May of

18:51.787 --> 19:01.517
1942. Whereas we officially weren't disbanded, 
officially disbanded until July the 4th, 1942.

19:11.888 --> 19:21.017
And then- And a lot of us, several of us, that's 
another story, several of us stayed over until the

19:11.888 --> 19:21.017
10th of July. Very, very hard aerial combat down 
here. We're going to get to that. We want to get back

19:26.035 --> 19:30.340
to the regulations, though. Now, we've talked 
about the relationships between the former

19:30.380 --> 19:36.408
officers and the former enlisted men. What about 
the uniforms? The only thing we had in the way of

19:40.373 --> 19:48.743
uniforms that resembled military was those parts 
of, let's say, our military clothing. that when we

19:49.178 --> 19:53.425
got out of the service, we took with us because we 
know we could use. For instance, my flying

19:53.505 --> 19:58.332
coveralls.

19:58.593 --> 20:09.089
I had a blouse that I had a military blouse, the old 
what we called pinks in the military at that time,

19:58.593 --> 20:09.089
or the Army, Army Air Corps. It's sort of a gray 
slacks with a OD tunic. We called them pinks. Well,

20:17.393 --> 20:27.663
I had those copied in a sort of a gray, summertime 
uniform type, if you will, by a Chinese tailor. It

20:27.683 --> 20:30.626
looked just like, but a different color. What I 
chose to have as my uniform. Most of us did follow

20:33.749 --> 20:40.596
the

20:33.749 --> 20:40.596
British jungle khaki type. The British jungle 
blouse was slacks, and then shorts in the

20:40.796 --> 20:44.920
summertime. I've seen guys in an airplane in 
combat wearing straw hats, big cowboy type straw

20:45.457 --> 20:55.429
hats with earphones over them. I've seen them in 
t-shirts. We didn't have any particular

20:58.632 --> 20:59.934
uniforms. There were no uniform regulations at 
all, per se, no uniform regulations. Did you like

21:04.299 --> 21:06.742
or dislike them? I didn't mind. It didn't bother 
me. The only thing that struck me sometimes is a

21:13.756 --> 21:28.055
regulation pertaining, let's say, to discipline 
or control of people, like you can or can't do this.

21:28.636 --> 21:31.159
There's very, very few regulations. Oh, you'd see 
something on a bulletin board in a bar, for

21:31.179 --> 21:39.831
instance, you can't take drinks after midnight or 
something like that outside, something like

21:31.179 --> 21:39.831
that. But there was a minimum of regulation. Now, 
of course, we had the regular tech orders for the

21:42.160 --> 21:45.124
airplane. Just like those that are furnished with 
any airplane to the Air Force. And maintenance of

21:52.753 --> 21:55.597
the equipment. Standing orders for maintenance, 
of course. Right. Now, to log a flight, log a time,

21:59.482 --> 22:06.350
we had a forms one, those types. You just 
practically had to keep records. We'd have those.

22:11.266 --> 22:25.667
But like the DASH regulations for personnel, the 
DASH series for the district, the DASH series for

22:11.266 --> 22:25.667
the medical supplies, paperwork was a minimum, 
absolute minimum. What about as far as an

22:25.687 --> 22:30.434
identification card? Did you have any ID card?

22:35.161 --> 22:40.108
Of

22:35.161 --> 22:40.108
course, each one of us had our ID. passport with a 
visa in it. Under your own name. Yeah, under my own

22:45.271 --> 22:46.192
name. Like I was Charles R. Bond Jr. Clerk. It's not 
clerk. Yeah, it's clerk. But now, if I remember

22:53.921 --> 22:57.024
correct, yeah, we kept those in possession all the 
time. Even when you flew? No, not in combat. But

23:01.729 --> 23:08.957
likely, if we go from, move the unit from China down 
to Burma, we'd take that with us in our luggage, you

23:01.729 --> 23:08.957
know, the passport. So you'd have it with you. Or 
when we'd go to India to ferry an airplane back,

23:09.788 --> 23:14.234
we'd take that with us. I don't recall, oh, we'd 
have, no, matter of fact, to answer your question,

23:14.374 --> 23:23.666
we didn't have any official identification 
sites. I don't recall any. But we'd go down, have

23:24.748 --> 23:34.841
the printing office on one side make us like a 
business card, Charles Arbonne, ABG, then on the

23:24.748 --> 23:34.841
other side put Chinese letters, you know, Charles 
Arbonne.

23:36.543 --> 23:39.627
What about if you were shot down? And the Japanese 
got a hold of you. Then what? Again, it was just

23:46.032 --> 23:50.418
name, purpose on the unit. Is that what Chennault 
told you? No. Now, when it comes to that type of

23:52.541 --> 24:02.053
thing, to the extent we had been trained for this, 
Chennault didn't figure he had to harp much on

23:52.541 --> 24:02.053
this. That's still typical. We were military 
outfit when it comes to that. But now we did wear

24:07.139 --> 24:09.242
the... I got a trunk out in the garage. You don't 
need to see all this stuff. You've seen pictures of

24:12.838 --> 24:13.819
it. We wore it on the back of our jacket. In effect, 
it was printed in Chinese. It had a Chinese flag on

24:21.206 --> 24:24.850
it. It printed on a Chinese flag, in effect. And in 
effect, it said in Chinese, this is an American

24:27.292 --> 24:33.078
volunteer fighting for the Chinese. Give him all 
assistance if you possibly can. That's on the back

24:36.321 --> 24:37.583
of the jacket. Yeah, that was on there. We'd sew 
that on the back of the jacket. But incidentally,

24:40.593 --> 24:46.719
the two times I was shot down, I didn't have 
equipment. I didn't have my jacket on. And what

24:50.502 --> 24:52.504
would you fly in? No, I know, but what uniform? What 
would you usually wear yourself?

24:59.170 --> 25:03.934
Whenever I'd fly, I'd always wear my flying suit. 
And eventually, when that got so bad, like I say,

25:05.275 --> 25:10.380
these 250 calibers, sticking out in your cockpit. 
You know, you had to keep them all. And

25:14.948 --> 25:18.133
particularly when you're firing them, you know, 
they've got a pattern. The oil would drop out. It

25:19.436 --> 25:24.484
dropped right at your feet when your rudder's 
pedaled and your flying coveralls. Flying

25:24.504 --> 25:29.231
coveralls always from knee down would just pull 
them all continually. I'd have to watch them every

25:29.251 --> 25:31.335
day, you know. But eventually, they just wore out. 
Then we did have, finally got in supply, It seemed

25:37.107 --> 25:40.952
like the only supplies we got, clothing, was 
always Navy. I don't remember any Air Force stuff

25:41.012 --> 25:43.435
ever coming up. But we began to, towards the end, 
you know, when we proved our value as a fighting

25:43.455 --> 25:54.268
outfit, and Lend-Lease began to take effect, we 
did get some or another, most of it was Navy

25:43.455 --> 25:54.268
supplies. I got the Navy flying jacket, terrific 
one, that fur collar. Then I wore a Navy flying suit

25:58.773 --> 26:01.937
all the time. I had an old Air Force helmet when I was 
shot down the first time. I always wore a helmet, of

26:07.280 --> 26:10.223
course, and an oxygen mask. And gloves, half the 
time I'd wear my gloves. The time I got shot down, I

26:15.588 --> 26:21.513
didn't have them on, big and stuff.

26:21.533 --> 26:25.877
Boots, I had the calf-length boots that I wore all 
the time. I had them made in India. No, I had them

26:29.581 --> 26:33.464
made in Burma before I went up to China. OK. Now, 
let's talk now for a minute about Chanel. What kind

26:37.705 --> 26:45.093
of person was he?

26:45.113 --> 26:50.979
Well, the first thing that impresses you about 
Chenault is the appearance of his face when you see

26:45.113 --> 26:50.979
him. He's got that, in the typical picture you see 
him, he's got that jutted lower jaw stuck out,

26:52.241 --> 27:03.573
which indicates, you know, a determined, dogged 
individual. He's that way. that he is determined.

27:11.196 --> 27:13.078
He's very hard of hearing. Even back in 30, back in 
41 when I first met him, he was very hard of hearing.

27:21.832 --> 27:25.918
And to my knowledge, I never saw him wearing 
hearing aids.

27:27.881 --> 27:30.224
He is, he talks softly. He's got a good sense of 
humor.

27:36.937 --> 27:39.059
He's got a wit about him. He can needle you. He is a

27:43.224 --> 27:53.315
tactician superb on flying airplanes. He's much 
more, in my opinion, a tactician than he is a

27:53.335 --> 27:57.379
strategist. What do you mean? Tactical, in other 
words, like a fighter squadron. But planning a war

28:03.667 --> 28:09.495
campaign, that I don't think was his sport. Now, he 
learned it rapidly in planning campaigns in China

28:09.756 --> 28:17.467
because he had to. He was the Air Force. And he did 
well, but of course he had the backing of

28:21.252 --> 28:31.547
Generalissimo and all of his Chinese veteran been 
in the Army all their lives and knew the country and

28:31.848 --> 28:34.671
all.

28:39.377 --> 28:41.659
General Chenault didn't have a complete Air 
Force. He didn't have a bomber force. He just had

28:42.861 --> 28:47.406
fighters and some training aircraft. He knew how 
to organize and get a unit going. Did he win the

28:53.453 --> 28:55.816
respect of his men? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Matter of 
fact, all of us loved him. Well, it was lovely.

29:03.019 --> 29:04.121
There was no dissension? Oh, yes. There was a few. 
There's always a few, you know. I've heard Greg

29:09.727 --> 29:11.889
Boyden get mad at him. I actually got mad at you, old 
man. When I was down in Burma, you know, with Bob

29:14.492 --> 29:17.555
Neal. Bob Neal was the squadron commander and I was 
his assistant. I always refer to Bob Neal and I

29:20.138 --> 29:28.587
because eventually, if you will, he was a group 
commander and I was a group assistant. I was a group

29:28.687 --> 29:31.150
operations officer, if you will. practically the 
whole outfit. But when we were down in Burma,

29:34.975 --> 29:42.546
remote from him up in China, we were on our last 
bottle of oxygen, and there was no effort to get us

29:34.975 --> 29:42.546
any more. Well, what the hell's the old man 
thinking about? We can't fly like this. Well, I

29:46.913 --> 29:49.597
guess everybody makes comments about their boss. 
He probably knew the situation, but just had no

29:51.139 --> 29:54.885
oxygen to get us. I don't ever remember the old man 
making a a decision that I was absolutely against.

30:08.875 --> 30:12.861
He personally ordered me to take some flights, 
which I did, and I should have. A couple of them I

30:13.241 --> 30:16.806
couldn't perform, and I had to return because of 
weather. I had to relieve another outfit. It was

30:18.589 --> 30:20.892
battle ridden, and I couldn't. But he knew as well 
as I did that when I returned, I brought the other

30:20.912 --> 30:28.322
eight airplanes back with me. He was 
disappointed, and I knew it, but he never held it

30:28.859 --> 30:33.286
against me. He'd been the first to congratulate me 
when I returned from shooting an airplane down. He

30:41.338 --> 30:51.012
always seemed to show up at critical times when his 
presence was felt as a morale booster. He could

30:52.274 --> 30:55.339
talk to you where you could understand him. I've 
seen him stand up, you know, when morale was

30:55.657 --> 30:59.481
getting a little low. For instance, we up at 
Kunming, sitting there not in fights, you know,

30:59.521 --> 31:07.570
for a while, early part of 42, and the third squad 
down in Rangoon was fighting every day, you know.

31:09.732 --> 31:18.361
Not just because of the $500 an airplane never 
getting shot when they shoot them down, but we just

31:09.732 --> 31:18.361
weren't in combat, and damn it, we wanted to go down 
there. Well, he had to explain why he couldn't

31:18.502 --> 31:23.487
rotate us as quick and as often as we wanted to, 
because... And he'd get up, and some of the men were

31:24.192 --> 31:29.459
disgruntled, apologizing. He would stand up and 
talk to them just like I'm talking to you, not as a

31:29.479 --> 31:41.634
commander talking to his men, but not as a general 
talking to a private, but as a man talking to a man.

31:42.735 --> 31:45.579
And he had savvy feelings. He could explain things 
away. A motivator.

31:54.938 --> 31:58.503
But he wouldn't, I don't think he would inspire me. 
He would, I would do what he wanted me to do, and did.

32:03.110 --> 32:11.902
I respect him, but for instance, I didn't have 
almost the reverence for him like I had for LeMay. I

32:11.922 --> 32:16.469
knew LeMay was, I just knew he was a great man going 
to be. Chenault, he's my boss. I trust him, and I'll

32:19.614 --> 32:22.257
fight for him. He's that different. But you had 
confidence in this man and you trusted him? Oh,

32:26.345 --> 32:28.067
yeah, definitely. When he told you something, 
that was the way it was? I mean, he was an honest

32:31.892 --> 32:33.534
person? Oh, absolutely. And he had his troubles at 
his level, you know, for instance, retaining his

32:36.818 --> 32:43.927
command. Even before he was inducted back in 
service, they had two or three... Air Force

32:50.710 --> 32:54.014
Brigadier General in India in the 10th Air Force. 
Fighter-type commanders, you know, were just

32:54.715 --> 33:04.208
dying and pulling every string they could back to 
half-Arnold to come over and take over that Flying

32:54.715 --> 33:04.208
Tiger Group. And the old man always had to go to the 
Generalissimo, the old man Chennault, and of

33:04.228 --> 33:14.361
course stop anything like that. No, he was a 
General Chennault, in my opinion, But what that

33:21.035 --> 33:34.828
man did, not only for the United States and for 
China, but for the world at that time, he deserves,

33:21.035 --> 33:34.828
in my opinion, to be one of the great men of history. 
I don't think he's ever gotten full credit for what

33:35.088 --> 33:40.213
he did. No, he didn't. But looking back now, if you 
recall, well, you don't recall because you

33:42.135 --> 33:50.603
weren't born then, but this was in 41 and 42. The 
darkest, well, Pearl Harbor Day in a few weeks and

33:52.000 --> 33:58.830
months, right after Pearl Harbor Day, December 7, 
1941. Boy, there were some dark days in this

33:58.850 --> 34:01.794
country. Oh, I studied it. Oh, well, and you 
studied it. Okay. But, I mean, if you'd lived it.

34:06.622 --> 34:06.922
Yeah. See, I've talked to her wife and my mother and 
father and them, you know. And, boy, this country

34:11.188 --> 34:15.254
was, they were worried, scared. And the only 
bright spot, across the entire worldwide

34:18.815 --> 34:23.440
horizon, not only in Japan, but in Europe. Nobody 
would win in Europe in war. We hadn't even gotten

34:26.223 --> 34:27.625
into it. Was the American Volunteer Group going to 
combat and shoot down 24 airplanes, about losing

34:28.506 --> 34:39.018
one. Eight airplanes against 60. I've been in 
combat with 14 of us against probably 125. be shot

34:46.895 --> 34:47.516
down. Well, we're going to get to that. But to 
answer your question,

34:50.158 --> 35:01.709
he did something for the country in the darkest 
days that helped us over the bumpy spots. And a

35:01.730 --> 35:11.799
lot of his criticism comes from petty jealousy, in 
my opinion, by his professional rivals. You

35:12.180 --> 35:13.961
follow me? Sure.

35:18.637 --> 35:23.243
I wanted to ask you, what about his leadership 
capability? Well, I think I expressed that he was,

35:23.263 --> 35:28.170
no doubt, he was a leader. Now, he didn't fly with 
us. No. See, in the earlier days when he was in

35:30.153 --> 35:37.683
China, he actually flew an airplane and actually 
fought some of the Japs. I'm told this. I don't know

35:38.584 --> 35:41.669
this for a fact, but I'm sure I believe it. But with 
us, that was not his job. He didn't fly with us. He

35:45.975 --> 35:46.956
had his own little troop. his own little personal 
airplane, if you will call it, a little transport,

35:47.105 --> 35:57.760
that he picked, by the way, one of the Navy pilots, 
picked one of him, the Navy pilots out, to fly it for

35:47.105 --> 35:57.760
him. And he, if there was a problem at some 
particular base because of supply or something

35:58.061 --> 36:16.707
that was a difficult problem, lack of supply or 
organization, something communicated broke

35:58.061 --> 36:16.707
down, he'd show up. He'd show up at critical times. 
When we were starting a new campaign, let's say

36:19.458 --> 36:40.942
when we were moving a unit, like we moved from one 
base to another and sort of move in late at night

36:19.458 --> 36:40.942
with the idea of the next day catching a raid that 
came up habitually every day at, say, 10 o'clock in

36:19.458 --> 36:40.942
the morning, a la training purpose for the 
Japanese Air Force out of Hanoi against

36:19.458 --> 36:40.942
Kuilin. He'd come there and be on hand. Whenever he 
was at our base, we knew something was going to

36:47.652 --> 36:52.857
happen. He was that dynamic. Yet, I say that 
dynamic. Yet, I would never call him a dynamic

36:56.401 --> 37:00.065
person. Why not? Well, you think of a dynamic 
person as somebody entering the room, and he just

37:02.948 --> 37:09.514
bursts in and takes over. And boy, you know he's 
there. If you'd not have come into the room, you'd

37:11.897 --> 37:17.102
see him. He'd start telling you what he was there 
for, and sort of on a controlled basis, he'd take

37:17.757 --> 37:32.097
over and things would proceed without any great 
hullabaloo and so forth. He was much more mild

37:32.117 --> 37:33.659
mannered. More mild mannered? Yes, more mild 
mannered. But I've seen him mad where he cussed

37:36.703 --> 37:44.153
like Patton does, supposedly did.

37:51.187 --> 37:59.759
Now, let's get to your, what exactly was your 
title, and exactly what was your job during these

37:51.187 --> 37:59.759
combat missions, during 1942? During 1942? Well, 
I was a wingman. I was inducted as a wingman in the

38:05.467 --> 38:14.699
American Voluntary Group, and I eventually was 
supported. I was appointed to a flight leader,

38:16.161 --> 38:20.367
probably the early part of to a flight leader as a 
result of the December 18th air battle, the first

38:22.000 --> 38:27.408
one we had. Then I was a flight leader, and I turned 
out to be, you might say, the operations officer,

38:29.030 --> 38:46.896
if you will, for our first pursuit squadron, and 
Bob Neal was squadron commander's right-hand man

38:29.030 --> 38:46.896
after Sandell, the original squadron commander, 
was killed. Okay, and how many in the squadron?

38:53.135 --> 38:57.460
I'd have to refer to my records for the exact 
number. We originally planned to have 25

38:58.041 --> 39:01.324
airplanes, 25 pilots. I dare say in the first 
quarter we never had more than about 16

39:01.424 --> 39:17.743
or 17 pilots and probably 15 or 16 airplanes total 
at any one time. And so when you'd go on a mission,

39:19.144 --> 39:22.568
would you take... Half of that. Normally, most of 
our emergency were air defense nature, taking off

39:26.050 --> 39:33.156
from alert. Sometimes we'd have an air cap flying 
around, being prepared in the air for

39:33.937 --> 39:41.784
interception of the enemy, expecting to come 
over. But normally we'd operate and always take

39:42.344 --> 39:48.430
off in pairs, never by ourselves. At least two 
airplanes.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.368
Well, for instance, it depends on the situation. 
At Rangoon, we had cross runways, and we had four

39:54.388 --> 40:05.100
airplanes dispersed at the end of each of the two 
crossing runways, a total of eight. At other

40:05.120 --> 40:18.036
places, we had only two airplanes on alert, which 
is common practice, ground alert, and both of them

40:05.120 --> 40:18.036
would take off together. Whenever we planned a 
mission, like we planned the attack on Chiang Mai

40:19.552 --> 40:36.295
Air Base in Thailand in March 1942, we planned that 
with 12

40:19.552 --> 40:36.295
airplanes. The most airplanes that have ever been 
in combat together on our side, the most airplanes

40:36.315 --> 40:48.512
that the flying Tigers ever put up in one fight was 
14.

40:49.302 --> 40:57.312
at one time in Kunming, and I think we dispersed a 
flight of bombers at that time. Most of the

40:59.475 --> 41:13.413
nine-tenths of my fighting, 85% of it, was done in 
Rangoon, where normally we'd put up anywhere

40:59.475 --> 41:13.413
from, every plane we could get up there, we'd have 
ready, you know, to get in a fight. But we knew, I

41:14.114 --> 41:18.820
fought as many as four times a day, beat the enemy 
actually four times one day. Normally we'd have

41:19.306 --> 41:34.750
about eight to twelve, and maybe there'd be four 
RAF

41:19.306 --> 41:34.750
boosters or hurricanes that had come to evacuate 
out of Singapore. Normally we'd have eight to

41:34.830 --> 41:37.093
twelve. We had twelve up, that was good. Many times 
we've taken over two airplanes. But I'd see as many

41:45.293 --> 41:51.902
as 120, 125, 130 Japanese fighters come over 
against us, and we'd have eight airplanes there.

41:54.405 --> 41:58.651
Now, how long did you stay out of Kunming? Well, 
right after Pearl Harbor Day, two of the squadrons

42:00.834 --> 42:05.140
went up to Kunming. On the 14th of December, one 
went to Rangoon. We continued to stay in that

42:07.804 --> 42:12.330
posture. Rotating every now and about once every 
month or 35 days, changing the squadron at Rangoon

42:12.732 --> 42:24.568
back up to Kunming and replacing it with one of the 
old squadrons down there. So we kept one fourth,

42:24.669 --> 42:35.143
one third of the outfit at Rangoon until the 
British forced us out the last day or two of

42:24.669 --> 42:35.143
February 1942. And that happened to be our 
squadron. And then they took over. And they took

42:38.948 --> 42:40.090
over. And then you went back up to... And we 
gradually... We pulled out and flew... Then

42:40.593 --> 42:47.622
where'd you go? We flew north to... Do

42:47.922 --> 43:06.466
you

42:47.922 --> 43:06.466
know what the name of it is? Well, last year. We flew 
to a base in northern Burma. It's

43:10.698 --> 43:16.905
on the Irrawaddy River. I can't think of it. But we 
just retreated, if you will. OK, so in March? The

43:23.452 --> 43:27.296
first few days, well, the last day, I think it's 
28th of February. OK, 28th of February. We

43:30.340 --> 43:31.661
evacuated Rangoon. You left Kunming and Rangoon. 
No, no, we stayed Kunming. See, Kunming is our base

43:36.507 --> 43:38.209
in China. OK, so you all stayed there. We all stayed 
there. But we pulled out of the forward base in the

43:39.959 --> 43:46.024
south at Rangoon because the Japanese forced us 
out. And, of course, the British pulled out too. In

43:47.886 --> 43:52.950
fact, the reason we pulled out is because the 
British pulled a radar out that night. Then you

43:52.970 --> 43:54.572
went where? Northern Burma. Then we evacuated to 
northwestern Burma, just west of Lascio. And we

44:03.600 --> 44:09.645
continued to do air alert there for about, we kept, 
about four to eight airplanes down there with the

44:09.878 --> 44:23.021
RAF and helping them still defend at least 
northern part of Burma for about a month. Then we

44:23.041 --> 44:34.722
pulled out of there back further north and last 
you'll see the Japanese begin to penetrate

44:23.041 --> 44:34.722
further north into Burma and eventually we pulled 
everything across into

44:40.574 --> 44:48.347
Low Wing China, which is just across the river into 
southern Yunnan province of China. Pulled

44:48.367 --> 44:54.516
completely out of Burma because the Japanese were 
then approaching the southern border of China.

44:55.077 --> 45:06.075
And we continued to operate out of Low Wing, which 
was really our main supply base in the southern

44:55.077 --> 45:06.075
part of China,

45:07.017 --> 45:10.962
Burma Road had been built that far north at that 
time, and we had a supply base there. And then we

45:12.284 --> 45:21.336
operated out of Lower Wing and Kunming against the 
Japanese in the Burma area for quite a while. And

45:21.436 --> 45:32.952
later on, we moved toward the Kunming outskirts up 
to Chungking, then subsequently from Chungking

45:21.436 --> 45:32.952
to Guilin, depending on where the operations were 
the most critical. But see, we had to defend the

45:33.573 --> 45:36.737
Burma Road approaches. Then when the Japanese 
took over Burma, they tried to build a Lido Road

45:36.869 --> 45:47.279
across the hump from India into China, and they did 
build a road. I think it got mules across it. We had

45:50.342 --> 45:51.483
to defend that. Then we had to defend the hump 
route, fly air transport command. The Japanese

45:56.348 --> 45:59.491
would come up there and shoot airplanes down. So we 
had to defend that part a little. And then as the

46:01.914 --> 46:04.176
Japanese started moving further into the central 
part of China from the Hankow area, coming down

46:04.797 --> 46:14.245
towards Guilin, we had to move airplanes up in that 
area. So we began to move all over southern China.

46:17.528 --> 46:18.729
It depended on where we were needed. And once or 
twice, like this famous raid on Chiang Mai,

46:19.490 --> 46:32.762
Thailand, we planned a raid down through the 
northern part of Burma, or the eastern part of

46:19.490 --> 46:32.762
Burma, to hit the Japanese Air Force in Thailand. 
That's another story on its own. Okay, why don't we

46:36.803 --> 46:41.653
start in right now then with the missions. And of 
course, your first one was the 14th of December,

46:41.673 --> 46:44.840
1941. 18. I thought you said 14. Oh, no, 14. We 
moved. You moved to come in, and the 18th was the

46:50.572 --> 46:54.279
number one mission. Yeah, the 18th.
