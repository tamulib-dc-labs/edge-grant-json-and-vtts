00:01.263 --> 00:23.275
Stangle, would you tell us something about your 
early life, including the names of your parents,

00:01.263 --> 00:23.275
and if you know them, the dates of their birth and 
death and the places of that, the date and place of

00:01.263 --> 00:23.275
your birth, and whatever schools you attended 
before you went to A&M and any other childhood

00:01.263 --> 00:23.275
recollections that you may have. Well, Mr. 
Schultz, I was born in Stangleville, Wisconsin in

00:28.718 --> 00:39.407
1889

00:28.718 --> 00:39.407
and came to Texas in 1897. I

00:39.547 --> 00:48.214
forget just exactly what. And the reason for 
coming to Texas and leaving Wisconsin where I was

00:49.255 --> 00:58.523
born was a terrible loss that my father entailed 
while I was just a youngster. This was a financial

01:05.806 --> 01:06.968
loss? Financial loss, yes. In other words, he was 
in the lumber and flour mill business, and they had

01:09.131 --> 01:17.363
a flood. And he lost all the lumber because it was 
stacked on the banks. The banks caved in, and it

01:24.012 --> 01:29.320
went down Lake Michigan. And his flour was in 
sacks, stored, and became paste, you see. So all of

01:39.152 --> 01:45.099
his income was lost. And of course, it just 
discouraged him, and he decided he'd get away from

01:45.119 --> 01:50.825
it just as far as he could. Although we did have a 
farm, and we lived on that farm for a couple of years

01:51.346 --> 01:58.834
before we came. In Texas,

01:59.253 --> 02:09.964
we came to Bryan, Texas.

02:13.367 --> 02:28.062
Our father's cousin was a Catholic priest, and he 
was the one who was responsible for getting us to

02:13.367 --> 02:28.062
Texas.

02:28.548 --> 02:45.406
As you know, the Swift and Armour built their 
plants in Fort Worth, and he figured that would be a

02:28.548 --> 02:45.406
good place to take a large family, and that's where 
we moved to, to Fort Worth. What was your father's

02:46.888 --> 02:47.929
name? My father's name was John, John J. Stangle. 
And your mother's name was what? My mother.

02:58.838 --> 03:17.207
mother's name is Anne, and you want her maiden name 
is Seidenglanz, S-E-I-D-E-N-G-L-A-N-Z,

02:58.838 --> 03:17.207
Seidenglanz.

03:18.148 --> 03:24.238
You'll find a lot of this material in Who's Who in 
America. You say you were a large family. How many

03:26.549 --> 03:28.251
brothers and sisters did you have? Well, of 
course, the original family, I

03:28.591 --> 03:38.521
had two sisters and two brothers. Now, that is the 
original family. And my father married me. And

03:46.950 --> 03:51.795
there's five children in that family. And then he 
separated from his second wife. My mother died

04:03.227 --> 04:07.832
before I had a chance to know her. I never did know my 
mother. And there's five children in that family.

04:16.342 --> 04:20.567
So they're scattered all over the United States, 
you might say. Well,

04:22.218 --> 04:30.525
I suppose maybe that's about all the background 
you need on. Do you remember anything about the

04:31.226 --> 04:34.169
trip from Wisconsin to Texas? Yeah, I do. Of 
course, we were moved, with the help of my uncles,

04:38.152 --> 04:51.364
to a loading dock, we'll say, on Lake Michigan. And 
we went in a ship on Lake Michigan to Chicago. And in

05:02.251 --> 05:07.919
Chicago, we caught a train and came by rail to 
Bryan, Texas. And that was in the mid-'90s? That is

05:12.205 --> 05:14.167
in the mid-'90s, yes.

05:16.991 --> 05:17.532
I don't know. I think it was 97, to be honest. I think 
so. Did you then attend school sometime in Bryan?

05:30.232 --> 05:30.652
Did I? Yes. In other words, I think it was third 
grade when I attended Catholic school, and then of

05:32.154 --> 05:51.473
course later a public school, and I went to school 
there until my seventh grade, I think. Then your

05:51.824 --> 05:54.028
family moved to Fort Worth. Family moved to Fort 
Worth, yes. When they moved to Fort Worth, of

05:55.951 --> 06:06.548
course I moved with them and enrolled in Texas A&M 
from Fort Worth. So you completed your high

06:06.809 --> 06:10.375
school, your schooling in Fort Worth then. Right.

06:13.420 --> 06:18.388
How did you happen to choose Texas A&M?

06:21.693 --> 06:32.588
There was just, in my class, graduating class, 
there were 10 students, eight girls and two boys,

06:21.693 --> 06:32.588
and I was one of the boys.

06:35.552 --> 06:46.587
And there was only one, two institutions that we 
knew, that is Texas A&M and University of Texas.

06:47.410 --> 06:54.581
And since we were in Fort Worth, neither one of us 
had the desire to go to University of Texas. So we

06:56.024 --> 07:00.711
graduated in 1910.

07:02.714 --> 07:10.887
And this other graduate, a boy, decided that he was 
going to college, and he selected Texas A&M. I

07:19.165 --> 07:20.767
didn't select Texas A&M. In fact, I didn't intend 
going to college because my parents weren't able

07:21.347 --> 07:27.394
to send me. But when September came, practically 
every member of that class went off to college

07:29.636 --> 07:38.325
somewhere. For instance, Mrs. Dupree, who lives 
here in Lubbock, went to Oberlin. And, of course,

07:47.943 --> 07:51.909
John Condon was the boy, and he went to Texas A&M. 
And a lot of these others went. For instance, one

07:57.116 --> 08:07.890
girl, of course most of them are dead now, went to 
West Texas State at Canyon. Another one there,

08:08.782 --> 08:15.551
Monty Brown, I forget just what school she went to 
school. So they all went somewhere, and I was left

08:16.052 --> 08:25.284
in Fort Worth holding a bag.

08:27.227 --> 08:29.971
And so I got to thinking. I was working for Arm and 
Company, getting the seventeen and a half cents an

08:30.551 --> 08:37.641
hour. And I went to my father, and I says, if I work 
and save my money, can I go to college? He said, yes,

08:49.659 --> 08:53.343
and I'll help you all I can. So I enrolled in Texas 
A&M. I did a little bit of checking in your senior

08:59.370 --> 09:03.274
yearbook, and I believe there it said you 
somewhere there indicated you had worked for

09:03.693 --> 09:11.942
Swift for a couple years and for the Dunham's 
Percheron Farm. Yeah. Where was that? Now this

09:16.247 --> 09:29.481
Dunham's Percheron Farm was in Wayne, Illinois, 
and I worked there during the summer, not during

09:16.247 --> 09:29.481
the regular session. That was during the summer 
while you were at A&M. Well, I was at A&M, yes. My

09:36.117 --> 09:39.040
first summer on that farm was in 19... I guess 1912,

09:39.061 --> 09:49.114
because I enrolled in 1910, 1911.

09:49.134 --> 09:52.759
I enrolled at A&M in 1911. So you did stay out one 
year between high school and... Yeah, I did stay

09:57.912 --> 10:06.020
out one year working to earn enough money to go to 
college, and I saved over $700. Was that working at

10:07.301 --> 10:08.983
17 cents an hour? Well, no, I did better than that. I 
got increases, gradual increases in salary, and

10:12.406 --> 10:25.759
when I left to go to A&M, I was getting 25 cents an 
hour. which was a white-collar job. And, of

10:29.811 --> 10:37.319
course, they told me, we wouldn't go to A&M. We'd go 
stay here and work for SWIFT. SWIFT will take care

10:40.843 --> 10:43.647
of you. And I said, no, I'm going to college. This 
was the people at SWIFT that told you that? Yeah.

10:51.756 --> 10:55.780
Did you go through any particular special 
procedures to go to Texas A&M? Did you have to apply

10:56.468 --> 10:59.032
for admission or something like that? No, I was a 
graduate. I was of Northside High School. It was

11:06.202 --> 11:10.548
North Fort Worth when I enrolled there. But during 
the time, during my last two years, it became

11:11.449 --> 11:23.286
Northside High

11:11.449 --> 11:23.286
School. And that's when I graduated in 1910 from 
Northside High School. So then all you had to do was

11:29.866 --> 11:34.131
get on the train and go down to College Station and 
register. Yeah, but I didn't go with this fellow

11:34.392 --> 11:42.783
with whom I graduated the same time I did. I went 
with another boy from Fort Worth, and his name was

11:42.803 --> 11:50.674
Fisher.

11:52.713 --> 12:00.244
John Curran Godfrey Fisher, we called him J.K. 
Fisher, we called him Blondie. And he had been

12:01.485 --> 12:06.552
there the previous year, so he knew the ropes, you 
see. And I became his roommate at A&M in Miller

12:07.894 --> 12:14.163
Hall. So he was a sophomore and you were a fish. I was 
a fish, right. And... Were you his man, so to speak,

12:22.177 --> 12:25.423
then? Did you have to do a few jobs for him? Well, of 
course, I didn't do all of them for him, but I did a

12:27.687 --> 12:32.134
lot of jobs.

12:38.906 --> 12:47.020
When you arrived there on campus and registered, 
and you were a fish in K Company, I believe. the same

12:47.506 --> 12:49.689
company Fisher was in? No, he was in I Company. He 
was in I Company. But I and K lived, were in the same

12:52.272 --> 12:54.394
dorm? Right, in the same dorm. And you see there's 
four companies to a battalion. And there's two,

13:01.944 --> 13:09.212
the outside companies were the tall fellas, and 
the inside companies were the short fellas. So I

13:10.574 --> 13:12.957
got in the company that had the short fellas, and 
there was a little maneuvering there. But I got in I

13:21.758 --> 13:30.331
Company,

13:21.758 --> 13:30.331
that is the second year, not the first year. The 
first year I was definitely in K Company. You

13:33.816 --> 13:36.560
didn't have any choice in that then? No, not the 
first year. The second year, I did. When they asked

13:41.326 --> 13:47.092
me, what company do you want to get in? I said, I want 
an eye company. He said, stand under that marker.

13:53.519 --> 13:56.321
And he looked at me and said, you're too short. You 
can't get an eye company. And so he says, see

14:01.387 --> 14:04.830
Sargent Zone. talk to him. So I went over to see 
Sargent and so on and so on. And I said, I want to get

14:10.941 --> 14:15.969
an eye company. He says, why do you want to get an eye 
company? I said, I'm rooming with a boy from Fort

14:19.214 --> 14:24.261
Worth. Both of us are poor boys. And we're going to 
buy our books together and share a lot of our

14:26.144 --> 14:32.273
expenses. And that's really So he wrote on this 
instance card,

14:34.747 --> 14:53.250
let's see, how did he put that?

14:53.270 --> 14:55.633
K Company, I Company of Room.

14:58.336 --> 15:01.880
So the next sergeant says, well, which company do 
you want in? I said, I Company.

15:06.843 --> 15:16.196
K Company, I Company, I mean K Company, I Company 
room, so they had room in I Company. So I got in I

15:16.556 --> 15:19.019
Company. And so you know from your experience, the 
first week at A&M, they landed line up these

15:29.033 --> 15:38.687
students,

15:29.033 --> 15:38.687
and of course you'd line them up in the company by 
size. And in my company, they started with these

15:39.968 --> 15:47.119
tall boys over here, and they came down, down, 
down, down. Here I was the last one. And this

15:52.386 --> 15:57.353
captain, Wade Burleson, He looked at me a while and 
says, he says, Ron, what the hell do you want in this

15:58.852 --> 16:07.061
company? I says, I want a room with J.K. Fisher. And 
he says, well, I'll let you stay in the eye company.

16:15.451 --> 16:16.612
He says, you're too short. I'll let you stay in the 
eye company. And I'll try to cover you up, hide you.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.525
And so he did. That first week put me in the rear 
rank, the smallest group of eight, and I stayed in I

16:27.961 --> 16:53.766
Company until I returned to A&M after I left A&M in 
between enrolling and graduating.

16:56.581 --> 16:59.344
What were your first reactions to the school when 
you arrived?

17:04.751 --> 17:09.696
Well, I was very favorably impressed. And I took 
the mucks with me. What I'll say, I took the bricks

17:16.865 --> 17:20.269
and the bats both, you know. And I spent my first 
night in a tent. We had tents in those days. And

17:31.348 --> 17:35.314
then, of course, I got with this room with Fisher. 
Fisher and I had a room on a third, what we called

17:36.596 --> 17:43.225
stoop, third stoop, in Milner Hall. And Milner 
Hall was right next to where Subiza Hall is now, but

17:43.245 --> 17:50.956
Subiza Hall wasn't there then. You had the Ole Miss 
Hall there. Yeah. You were there during the fire of

17:55.340 --> 17:57.443
the old mess hall. Right. I imagine that was some 
exciting times. Oh, well, it was. When the mess

18:02.631 --> 18:03.812
hall burned. The old main burned. The old main 
building burned. Then we had, of course, well, I

18:09.541 --> 18:17.172
can tell you a lot of things that happened about 
that time. What sort of things? Well, for

18:20.557 --> 18:22.900
instance, whenever... When

18:23.858 --> 18:32.246
the mess hall burned, they built a temporary mess 
hall out of tin, you know. And they got it built

18:33.467 --> 18:38.532
during the Christmas holidays. And by marching us 
to meals, by the time they said, take seats,

18:40.333 --> 18:53.646
everything on the table was cold.

18:54.655 --> 18:57.638
And if so, we didn't enjoy our meals at all. This was 
in the temporary mess hall. Temporary mess hall.

19:02.582 --> 19:13.492
And we were all dissatisfied because we'd all come 
home after having had good meals and being taken

19:02.582 --> 19:13.492
care of and so on and so forth. So things were just 
not right with us. And I don't know that anybody has

19:18.196 --> 19:23.481
talked to you about the strike. We didn't have a 
strike, but we did say we'd do certain things if

19:24.895 --> 19:33.904
you'll do certain things. In other words, we're 
not going to classes under these conditions.

19:48.238 --> 19:53.603
But we will attend our military obligations.

19:54.950 --> 20:07.627
We'll march according to schedule, and we'll line 
up for our march to meals and so on. Do everything

20:08.328 --> 20:12.834
that we have to do that pertains to military. But as 
far as pertaining to academics, we quit. I took, I

20:19.803 --> 20:24.349
think, possibly three exams. before the 
president warned us, says, now you have one of two

20:24.751 --> 20:33.564
choices. You can either stay, carry on as you 
carried on before this thing happened, or you can

20:35.167 --> 20:49.488
just pack your bags and trunks and take it out for 
home. Well, that's what we did. 466 of us signed a

20:54.029 --> 21:01.115
petition not to go to class. And so we did go to 
class, and I was one of those that packed up and went

21:03.457 --> 21:10.003
home. This was in what, 1913? This was 1913. And of 
course, not all of them left because they figured

21:15.528 --> 21:23.175
it was pretty dirty to take out on those 1913 boys. 
not have a final parade, but we did have a final

21:23.763 --> 21:31.034
parade for the 1913 class. When the parade was 
over, things broke up. We scattered everywhere

21:35.341 --> 21:38.886
and of course went home. When I arrived home,

21:45.413 --> 21:54.566
My father met me, mouth wide open, and asked to say, 
ìWhat are you doing here?î I said, ìWait a minute.

21:54.586 --> 22:03.479
Let me talk.î So I told him what had gone on and what 
had happened and so on, and I couldnít say. Thatís

22:04.561 --> 22:12.973
when I left and went to Dunhamís Perchard Farm in 
Wayne, Illinois. This was in the latter part of

22:13.662 --> 22:22.395
January.

22:22.815 --> 22:31.207
I stayed there and worked until September

22:22.815 --> 22:31.207
of 1913. This

22:32.169 --> 22:43.585
fellow, Fisher, came up there and worked with me 
that summer. And

22:43.953 --> 22:59.818
so I became kind of a horseman, and of course they 
wanted me to stay there and work with horses, but I

22:43.953 --> 22:59.818
said, no, I'm going to college. So then the uproar 
about in 13 was sparked by the unsatisfactory food

23:00.519 --> 23:10.776
after the fire in the mess hall? Right. Uh-huh. 
That plus some other things. We had some illness

23:14.938 --> 23:17.942
that was serious. We had a very popular student who 
died from a cut vein. He was hanging a picture and

23:26.095 --> 23:39.036
ended up up on a chair and jumped off this chair and 
the glass broke and he cut a He died in that room,

23:39.438 --> 23:44.222
just bled to death right there. He was a very 
popular fellow named Leonard, August Leonard.

23:58.135 --> 24:09.225
Then we had some undue hazing and we didn't take 
this. take this hazing, and so those that were most

24:10.083 --> 24:22.441
serious in this hazing were expelled, about 21 of 
them. And that upset us, you see. This was when

24:27.608 --> 24:30.252
Milner was president, right? Yeah, Milner was 
president.

24:36.155 --> 24:40.261
Was there anything comparable to that developed 
after the Old Main fire? I believe that was before

24:40.281 --> 24:43.266
the mess hall, wasn't it? Yeah. You mean this fire? 
No. The mess hall had already burned up. The mess

24:51.619 --> 24:53.461
hall burned first and then Old Main? First,

24:53.481 --> 24:57.167
yeah.

25:00.775 --> 25:03.879
After the Old Main burned, what did you do for 
classrooms? A lot of classes had been held in Old

25:03.959 --> 25:06.602
Main, had there not? Yes. Now, that's lost me. I 
don't recall just exactly where we, just where we

25:11.508 --> 25:16.334
held classes. And, of course, the library was lost 
at that point, what there was of it. Yeah. Because I

25:23.984 --> 25:28.629
know I helped carry books. Well, I think 
possibly... Maybe part of the Old Main building

25:32.568 --> 25:52.012
was saved, and we used the rooms that were saved 
there for classrooms, because I recall carrying

25:32.568 --> 25:52.012
books up there and getting paid 15 cents an hour for 
doing it. Well, from what pictures I've seen, it

25:52.953 --> 25:58.760
was nothing but a few brick, some of the outside 
brick walls left after the fire. You mean the Old

25:59.141 --> 26:00.202
Main? Old Main building, yeah. Maybe that's it. 
But then, of course, they started the new building

26:02.302 --> 26:05.847
pretty soon after that. Right away. Yeah, and it 
was completed in 14, I believe.

26:16.543 --> 26:25.676
Except for the food that wasn't so good after the 
mess hall burned, what would you say about the food

26:16.543 --> 26:25.676
in the mess hall before the fire? Was it pretty 
good? Yeah, it was all right. In other words, we

26:27.739 --> 26:31.785
complained about the food, all of us, gained 
weight, so I didn't particularly kick on the food.

26:38.009 --> 26:51.748
Of course, I had a job, and I wasn't eating with the 
Corps as a sophomore, junior, and senior. I was

26:52.730 --> 26:56.595
working with the Horse Guard. And you ate?

27:00.385 --> 27:01.847
what we call work table. Uh-huh. Was this all the 
boys who had jobs? Who had jobs, involved work in

27:05.793 --> 27:13.145
the morning, ate at the same place, work table, you 
see. Uh-huh. This would include, did you have

27:14.567 --> 27:18.252
students who worked, waited tables in the mess 
hall? Did we? Yes. Yes.

27:23.821 --> 27:23.961
Uh-huh. And they ate at the work table. Work table. 
Either that or they just grabbed something before

27:26.744 --> 27:32.233
they went to class and so on.

27:35.319 --> 27:42.010
What about you were still in school when Sbisa Hall 
was open, were you not? When Sbisa Hall, the new

27:42.030 --> 27:44.294
mess hall was completed? Yes, I was.

27:48.641 --> 27:52.127
I guess it was completed during Dr. Mazzello's 
time. Oh, I'm sure it was because, well, I don't

27:52.867 --> 27:55.850
know. How long were you fed in the temporary mess 
hall? I think the rest of that year. But of course, I

28:04.659 --> 28:06.361
wasn't there.

28:09.064 --> 28:11.005
I was one of those that took out. So I think the new 
mess hall had been built while I was gone. I see. And

28:24.001 --> 28:26.043
so how was the food there? Pretty good? Very good, 
yeah.

28:33.812 --> 28:39.398
What privileges did the upperclassmen have that 
the freshmen didn't have?

28:42.801 --> 28:48.588
Could the upperclassmen do things like leave 
campus and things of that nature that the freshmen

28:42.801 --> 28:48.588
couldn't? Yeah, they could get a permit. They'd 
have to get a permit from the commandant, and they

28:53.110 --> 29:01.438
could have a date once a month. They could have a 
dance once a month. Freshmen didn't have any

29:07.344 --> 29:21.278
privileges at all, except for going to class and 
getting their

29:07.344 --> 29:21.278
tail licked. It didn't bother me. On that third 
stoop, I ran around it many a time. You know,

29:29.275 --> 29:40.687
upperclassmen were up there with their belts, 
giving us crack on the butt.

29:42.209 --> 29:49.797
What kinds of things did you do for entertainment 
or recreation during the years you were there?

29:51.380 --> 30:00.893
Well, I did not have a date until my junior year. Was 
that for one of the big dances? One of the big, yes.

30:05.839 --> 30:07.281
That was my first date. Then I think I had two more 
after that as a senior. So I didn't date in the first

30:14.170 --> 30:16.093
place. I didn't have money. to bring a girl down 
there and keep a girl until I

30:20.135 --> 30:30.729
didn't have many dates.

30:33.012 --> 30:34.474
I remember the girls very well. One of them was from 
Fort Worth and the other one was from Houston.

30:43.105 --> 30:45.869
Did you have a place where you could play dominoes 
or anything like that? No. What about, could you

30:48.712 --> 30:50.074
play cards? No. Was that against the rules? That 
was against the rules. Could you smoke? Yeah.

31:01.571 --> 31:03.333
Cigarettes or cigars or both? Both.

31:08.159 --> 31:11.042
Cigars cost a nickel. And that's when I started 
smoking cigars. I still smoke cigars now. And I

31:19.990 --> 31:25.690
bought one of these aluminum holders, you know. I 
like that.
