WEBVTT

00:01.145 --> 00:11.419
We opted, you know, back in the 70s to someday keep 
the boundaries around the Woodlands so that it

00:01.145 --> 00:11.419
cannot be a separate subdivision. That's very 
important, a separate political subdivision,

00:11.439 --> 00:17.728
you know, in the town, because it has to answer 
Houston's need. That was the whole philosophy at

00:17.748 --> 00:20.172
the beginning of the philosophy. Mr. Mitchell, 
let's start back, if you will, and tell us, if you

00:20.773 --> 00:29.565
think the Woodlands has built out as you 
anticipated that it would, 20 years ago or so when

00:30.018 --> 00:32.922
you began this project. Well, I would say this as 
far as what we hear from the people and whether it

00:32.942 --> 00:38.270
has done very well. I talk to people all the time 
because we live out here, and they're sincere.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.264
They say, I've been here eight years now, and I want 
to tell you it's the best place I've ever lived. I

00:48.404 --> 00:53.051
mean, hundreds of people tell me that, and I don't 
think they do it just to bother me out. They do it

00:53.071 --> 00:54.814
because they're sincere about it. And what do they 
point to? I would say this, that the... The fact

00:59.127 --> 01:12.043
that we're probably behind schedule something 
you've had, but three high-energy, not

00:59.127 --> 01:12.043
high-energy, but also high-interest peaks that 
slows down production of the crash of Houston in

00:59.127 --> 01:12.043
the last six, seven years. When we first opened in 
74, the interest rates had gone through the

01:12.664 --> 01:16.008
ceiling. I'll just give you, we went through about 
three cycles of high-interest rates, the crash of

01:16.088 --> 01:23.177
Houston. But in spite of all that, the wooden has 
done very well. But I'd say we're You know, we're

01:27.798 --> 01:29.260
behind our schedule. We thought we'd probably be 
45,000 people. By now, we're 32,000 people. So

01:34.606 --> 01:35.548
we're doing quite well. So in terms of physical 
size, it's not where you really anticipated

01:35.728 --> 01:38.972
being. In terms of pace, it's not exactly where we 
originally thought it would be. But as far as the

01:42.516 --> 01:50.126
quality and as far as doing well from a land 
development standpoint, it's profitable on land

01:42.516 --> 01:50.126
development. On our capital structure, on office 
buildings and apartments, it'll take a while for

01:50.146 --> 01:54.531
those to be profitable on cash flow basis, and they 
looked very promising. So I think that, in

01:59.156 --> 02:01.720
general, the Woodlands have done very well. In 
fact, I have to say that, you know, I've always

02:03.262 --> 02:07.689
studied all new towns in the world. I went to 
Europe, I looked at France, I looked at England, I

02:08.210 --> 02:21.430
had Dick Brown go to Capiola, I'd go to Sweden, I 
looked at the West Coast, I looked at the East

02:08.210 --> 02:21.430
Coast, Columbia, I took some of the people from 
Columbia, some of the people from from Irvine and

02:21.781 --> 02:26.268
merged them in because there was no one in Houston 
originally knew the magnitude of that project.

02:26.829 --> 02:28.571
Columbia was the second generation of Newtown. 
Levittown was the first generation of Newtown.

02:32.377 --> 02:34.640
And we're the third generation over Columbia. And 
I would say this, that we're pulling it off, I

02:35.541 --> 02:39.728
think, quite well. In fact, it's unique in the 
country, in my opinion. If you look at all major

02:42.973 --> 02:46.017
projects in the country, None of them have done the 
entire fabric that we have put together between

02:46.553 --> 02:54.203
the social structure, the environmental 
structure, and maybe the economic structure.

02:54.224 --> 02:56.306
Irvine is much better economically. Is it? 
Irvine's done very well, but the land cost was very

02:57.087 --> 02:59.571
low. I think Goldberg of New York Times, he really 
criticized it about a year ago. That's the

03:07.041 --> 03:08.783
argument, Goldberg. Because it's just a sea of 
roost. Here, you go right through the wilderness,

03:11.808 --> 03:15.733
32,000 people, you don't see anything. What we did 
to preserve the natural appearance of the

03:16.574 --> 03:23.261
wilderness was, I think, was rather unusual. And 
then how do you really environmentally do that and

03:24.062 --> 03:27.825
still make a profit? That's a tough one. Right, 
that's the trick. In other words, I could crash

03:30.028 --> 03:36.815
every tree down and turn around and get more lots or 
get more office building, but that isn't what we

03:30.028 --> 03:36.815
do. We try to design with nature. We try to design 
the social structure with each other, and we try to

03:39.657 --> 03:43.722
have to make a profit out of it. And I'd say this is 
coming along well. If I looked at all the projects

03:46.662 --> 04:03.080
in the country, look at Reston, Virginia, 
Columbia, Maryland, Irvine, Westlake, all the

03:46.662 --> 04:03.080
ones on the west coast, all the HUD projects, which 
none of them have really been, that have made it

03:46.662 --> 04:03.080
except the Woodlands, that had no default. I would 
say that this should stand out, in my opinion, as

04:04.721 --> 04:12.310
something unusual and unique. Now, how do we 
convince the world, that's what it is. And how do

04:16.357 --> 04:18.240
they gain on what we have done? Which is why I have 
you people working on this. How do you really

04:20.644 --> 04:25.931
document this so other people can do the same thing 
on the next generation? To go through our case

04:25.951 --> 04:29.096
history, which we wrote the first book, as you 
know. And therefore, we're trying to get the

04:29.997 --> 04:35.545
factual information over the next 10 years of what 
it was since the first book. How that was put out.

04:36.947 --> 04:37.669
You're documenting that. We're also doing a 
picture essay on the Woodlands now, which is

04:37.689 --> 04:42.255
different than what you're doing. And then after 
you finish your factual study. What I'll do is to

04:45.799 --> 04:58.931
get maybe some other writers to go back from the 
beginning and do it on a combined documentary, but

04:45.799 --> 04:58.931
really have a flowing language that relates to a 
little different approach to it. You see what I

04:58.991 --> 04:59.632
mean? Sure. That's what I think we should do. 
Because the picture essay could be a coffee table

05:03.115 --> 05:11.563
thing for all families in the world or wherever 
else, you know, credentials or whatever it is. The

05:12.185 --> 05:21.277
other one is really what you, the first book and the 
second book that you're doing, or the facts you're

05:12.185 --> 05:21.277
getting together, really gives you how this was 
done. And is it successful? And with all the warts

05:24.281 --> 05:28.226
that you can find and all the pluses that you can 
find, you see. What are the warts and the pluses

05:28.266 --> 05:30.670
that you see right now? Well, I would say there's a 
lot of warts. I think that it's extremely

05:33.153 --> 05:38.079
difficult financially to make these things work. 
And I think this, that... that if you don't have the

05:41.497 --> 05:52.091
holding power or staying power and you don't show 
profit the first 10 years cash flow, most

05:41.497 --> 05:52.091
corporations won't take it. They won't take it. 
They won't look at the mid-term, long-term like

05:52.953 --> 05:56.297
we're looking at it. They look at it too 
short-term, next quarter, next year, next two

05:56.377 --> 06:01.504
years, and they won't take them on. I think that if 
it's successful over a long period of time, that it

06:02.325 --> 06:10.997
does have a good rate of return, which I think it 
will have, then more major whatever it is, pension

06:11.568 --> 06:18.576
funds, corporations, insurance companies, 
might take them on as investment. Now, the rest has

06:19.337 --> 06:23.141
been taken over by mobile. It went through three 
ringers of being more or less in the bankruptcy. So

06:29.588 --> 06:30.509
they're doing real well. They're happy with the 
rest of it. So the real key to a new community is the

06:32.431 --> 06:35.955
finance structure behind it. I would say that is 
the most difficult thing to do, financing and

06:36.526 --> 06:43.853
getting it, and knowing that it's a long waiting 
period to see that the cash flow turns around.

06:44.594 --> 06:48.998
Irvine could do it quicker because they own the 
land that started with the Pitch, Cincinnati. We

06:49.018 --> 06:53.042
had to buy the land at higher cost, you see, and most 
other people do, too. But I think that's the most

06:55.765 --> 06:57.006
difficult. Then, of course, there's always the 
complications of here we turn around the

07:02.969 --> 07:32.588
woodlands and we we've got we've got 
environmental impact study with the first one

07:02.969 --> 07:32.588
ever done by hud and we designed our roads and all 
our things and built an enormous infrastructure

07:02.969 --> 07:32.588
for the future and now they come back and say oh too 
bad now we're going to look at environmental

07:02.969 --> 07:32.588
impact again by pieces yeah see that's really 
disturbing oh we got a new uh wetlands ordinance

07:02.969 --> 07:32.588
that's coming out now that stops your development 
here in fact all of houston we're doing pretty well

07:02.969 --> 07:32.588
because we did have an early impact in And they're a 
little bit more liberal with us, but Houston's in

07:32.922 --> 07:41.049
trouble unless they get the law changed on what is 
wetlands, you see. Those retroactive type things

07:41.189 --> 07:48.835
really are very, very serious for developers to 
think about. My gosh, they just spend several

07:48.895 --> 07:56.302
hundred million dollars on roads and 
infrastructure and everything, and they change

07:48.895 --> 07:56.302
the rules on you. Those are the dangers we have. 
Then, we've done very well with the city of

07:57.683 --> 08:02.727
Houston, because we're in their external 
jurisdiction. We've done very well with the

08:03.348 --> 08:12.719
Montgomery County, because we're getting more 
and more commercial people here, because we've

08:03.348 --> 08:12.719
been working good tax abatements and things with 
Montgomery County. And that political strain is

08:12.919 --> 08:15.382
pretty well eased? The original strain was very 
stiff. Since then, they realize that Woodland's

08:18.085 --> 08:22.310
their future tax base. And they're working with 
it. And the school's working with it. So that's

08:24.733 --> 08:25.995
working good. We're able to get the toll road up. It 
was extremely important. As you know, it was very

08:29.259 --> 08:30.620
important. But you see, we're convinced The city, 
if you didn't get to the airport, why spend a

08:33.520 --> 08:37.325
billion on the airport? You couldn't get there. I 
mean, how are you going to get to the airport? Are

08:40.049 --> 08:42.012
they going to go in a helicopter? So, therefore, 
Lindsay, if I wouldn't do it, Lindsay would step in

08:42.032 --> 08:46.398
and do it. The total was really to serve all of 
North. Harris County and Montgomery County. It

08:50.604 --> 08:51.465
wasn't just for the women. It just so happened to 
come right by here because we're on the way. So,

08:55.391 --> 08:58.255
it's extremely important. I think that the... The 
various things in the River Authority we work with

09:01.229 --> 09:07.418
have been very well on our water systems and our 
source treatment plant systems. We've really had

09:08.219 --> 09:12.846
really great cooperation with entities like 
that. The federal regulations that come back

09:14.529 --> 09:21.740
retroactive are the most serious thing that would 
cause large developments to worry about whether

09:14.529 --> 09:21.740
you can get it done. And that's what you're going to 
be working with and against in the future. And yet

09:25.045 --> 09:30.072
we think we can work it out, because we do have, we 
designed it that way to start with. kept 7,000

09:30.423 --> 09:35.569
acres of wood claims that we wouldn't touch out of 
25,000 acres. One thing that we did do is to really

09:36.830 --> 09:40.054
preserve the forest. It's rather interesting.

09:45.100 --> 09:51.447
The original concept is how you design a forest and 
end up with 150,000 people and not destroy it. Now,

09:51.467 --> 09:53.049
that's a very difficult thing to do. And I think 
that so far it's working very well. And we keep the

09:57.575 --> 09:58.437
natural. You drive around the woods, you don't 
understand. We don't have a bunch of manicured

10:00.019 --> 10:07.273
lawns and a bunch of all the freeways manicured, a 
bunch of flowers all over the place. It's all the

10:07.293 --> 10:08.354
natural. One thing we've run into, incidentally, 
is that you're having to educate the people who

10:08.755 --> 10:16.670
live here how to live. That's right. See, every 
home that comes in here, we give them a booklet.

10:19.317 --> 10:20.358
Have you seen the booklet? The new booklet? 
They've got a very nice booklet. You're talking

10:22.061 --> 10:24.444
about a very sensitive subject to me, George. The 
lot next to me was just cleared yesterday. That's

10:26.467 --> 10:27.088
another... They cleared it? Yeah. Well, who was 
the builder? Lee. Who? Bill Lee. Well, why don't

10:32.816 --> 10:36.001
you get a hold of our design committee and kick 
their butts? As far as I can tell, everything they

10:37.303 --> 10:40.287
do... Did they clear a lot of the trees? It's 
practically... They're building to the lot

10:43.131 --> 10:44.693
line... That's your design committee. You've got 
some input from the community association. Raise

10:51.912 --> 10:53.094
hell with them. I'm going to raise hell. All right. 
But you've got to do it before it happens. It's too

10:55.837 --> 10:57.380
late. I know, but then, no, I think that you've got 
to raise hell or it won't happen again, Joe. You're

11:00.624 --> 11:01.725
a guinea pig, Joe. Sorry. How do you build that 
infrastructure, though, that can keep this kind

11:03.087 --> 11:08.955
of world and value system going? Very difficult. 
We fight hard for the trees. We raise hell with this

11:11.558 --> 11:14.342
wall market, clearly, and yet There's no doubt 
when you develop, you're going to cause some

11:15.436 --> 11:18.959
damage to the trees. There's no doubt about it. But 
I'll say this, that I think we've done,

11:19.680 --> 11:32.771
considering you see 32,000 people and you can't 
already see them in the buildings, we've done a

11:19.680 --> 11:32.771
remarkable job, even though we have some like 
Joey, and that's something we've got to get into,

11:19.680 --> 11:32.771
Joe, to see why it happened and to get a better 
control of that. So I get upset about it, too,

11:32.791 --> 11:39.917
because I go around a lot and I see things, and I 
think that it's very important to do that. But the

11:39.937 --> 11:44.481
Greenland people, they don't understand why they 
read like the Woodlands. They come out here and

11:45.440 --> 11:49.685
live, because we have hiking bike trails 
everywhere, you know. And we have, we designed the

11:49.705 --> 11:53.529
roads for 150,000 people to start with. And we 
designed the overpass, which costs us some trees.

11:56.672 --> 11:59.235
I don't want to do that, but then you've got that 
trade-off. I mean, I would get one to grow in the

11:59.255 --> 12:04.601
middle, and I hate to do it, because it's going to 
lose that beautiful layer of trees I'm going to

11:59.255 --> 12:04.601
lose. Or some of them. So I think we have to really 
figure out how you have the feeling of my own people

12:13.402 --> 12:18.267
You fight hard to do your design accordingly, and 
that's very difficult. Forget about the buyer. He

12:20.670 --> 12:21.911
doesn't know better, apparently. But there are 
people who now have to train the 24 builders. Their

12:26.236 --> 12:31.342
superintendents don't do it, and in fact, they're 
not supposed to cut any tree down that was six

12:26.236 --> 12:31.342
inches at all. If they did, Joe, you ought to raise 
hell without permission. If they did, I want to

12:34.485 --> 12:36.167
know about it. You tell me about it. Well, you 
couldn't put the house there if the tree's there.

12:41.146 --> 12:44.833
Well, I admit that some thing is right in the middle 
of a lot to do something. But there's some things

12:44.853 --> 12:50.682
that you could do something by changing your 
location around and miss some of those things. But

12:50.702 --> 12:57.915
however, it's a very difficult thing to urbanize 
and think you're going to keep it completely

12:50.702 --> 12:57.915
pristine. You can't do that. So you have to know 
there's some trade-offs. But what people don't

13:01.481 --> 13:04.165
realize about the Woodlands They drive around. 
They don't understand why it's so strikingly

13:05.775 --> 13:09.701
beautiful, because of the natural look. And you 
have buildings that reflect the trees on the side

13:10.983 --> 13:16.792
of the building. You have natural landscaping 
around the building. You don't have a bunch of

13:18.595 --> 13:22.360
flowers around the building. A few places of 
color, we have a few places. But even then, we work

13:23.983 --> 13:26.607
on them. So I think that is important. The thing is, 
the social structure is important. Economic base

13:32.174 --> 13:33.796
is very important. So how do you put it all 
together? We have schools. We have great schools

13:36.839 --> 13:40.763
that work hard with the Conway School District. 
With the private school, the Cooper Private

13:40.783 --> 13:44.707
School, we're funding the U of H out here now. We've 
got community college ready to come out here now.

13:47.951 --> 13:49.352
We have the high tech. We've got about 1,200 
scientists and assistants over there now in the

13:49.372 --> 13:52.696
high tech area. That's beginning to evolve. If you 
get up to 5,000, it'll be a critical mass. We're

13:56.960 --> 14:01.725
finally convincing A&M and all them they ought to 
get involved in the Woodlands, because that's

13:56.960 --> 14:01.725
where the action's going to be through HARC. And 
they're beginning to come alive. It's all part of

14:05.915 --> 14:07.737
history. Southwest, Texas, and the nation. And 
therefore, this could be a role model. I've looked

14:13.886 --> 14:17.030
at Kingwood and First Colony and Clear Lake. 
They're nice. But they're not like the Woodlands.

14:20.956 --> 14:23.539
Could you expand on one of the things you just said? 
One of the things, the strategic initiatives in

14:24.160 --> 14:31.290
the Woodlands that is little understood because 
it's very subtle, is the... the obvious, at least

14:31.895 --> 14:46.188
obvious to me, effort that you've gone to to 
develop an industrial, commercial background as

14:31.895 --> 14:46.188
well as the residential. The residential, you 
know... See, our objective, 150,000 people here

14:46.328 --> 14:54.356
eventually, in 30 or 40 years from now, is to have 
100,000 jobs, maybe more. And that's important.

14:56.298 --> 14:57.339
I'm not a suburb. I'm not a little subdivision. 
We're really, we're not a new town, because we've

14:59.384 --> 15:03.210
got to be part of the whole, part of Houston. And 
that's why we opted that Houston, see, in 72,

15:03.871 --> 15:19.954
Houston did not, they barely had what they call a 
five-mile extraterritorial jurisdiction, and

15:03.871 --> 15:19.954
they barely touched our south end, barely five 
miles from the city limits. I had the choice of

15:19.974 --> 15:27.926
saying, okay, we'll make a separate political 
subdivision up here, or be part of Houston. Well,

15:27.946 --> 15:29.188
philosophically, I don't think you can feed off 
the airport, off the infrastructure fusion, off

15:29.776 --> 15:37.243
the port, and not be part of the whole. If the talent 
that flees to the suburbs, in fact, the Woodlands

15:37.263 --> 15:41.907
concept was put together for that reason. In the 
60s, when I went to, I saw Bedford-Stuyvesant in

15:43.428 --> 15:46.952
New York. I saw Watts. And the concern is that, how 
do you urbanize better? How do we do it better? Or

15:53.838 --> 15:59.563
are you going to have, like, Los Angeles and 
Washington have these 100 political

15:53.838 --> 15:59.563
subdivisions Strangling the central core where 
it can't manage itself? Or can you make it be part of

16:03.776 --> 16:05.218
the whole? The town of Woodlands better make 
Houston work. Because you're going to be part of

16:08.904 --> 16:10.626
Houston. Because the brain drain and the tax drain 
goes to the suburbs. Is that working the way you

16:14.232 --> 16:17.597
thought it would, though, the Houston-Woodlands 
connection? One thing I haven't been able to do yet

16:17.617 --> 16:23.986
is to build the whole cross-section of the 
socioeconomic and ethnic mix. And I won't for 40

16:24.146 --> 16:25.308
years. And it'll never be 35%.

16:30.121 --> 16:32.043
black and 35% Hispanic. It'll probably be 15%, 
10-15% black and 10-15% Hispanic. I'm just giving

16:37.230 --> 16:39.512
you what I think we're having 40 years from now. So 
you don't make the social ethnic mix that you

16:40.013 --> 16:44.579
think, or economic mix. However, we had up to about 
three years ago, 14% run assist people in the

16:45.179 --> 16:49.585
woods. Now in the last three years with all these 
cheap houses that went on RTC, A lot of people

16:54.370 --> 17:00.617
bought these $60,000 condominiums for $30,000, 
and we didn't get them up here because there's no

16:54.370 --> 17:00.617
market up here. But now we're getting back to 
thinking about townhouses and cluster houses and

17:00.657 --> 17:06.084
getting a medium range. It used to be about $68,000 
per medium house. Now it's up to $120,000, and I

17:09.208 --> 17:11.030
don't like that. I'm trying to bring it down again 
by starting now that those things have dried up, go

17:11.571 --> 17:18.699
back into townhouses and cluster houses to build a 
lower end. When I used to get rent assistance from

17:19.520 --> 17:21.222
HUDS, programs I was able to build some more 
because one thing we did here in the Wilmington

17:21.742 --> 17:51.411
very unusual is the design of the Wilmington 
itself you can't take a $40,000 house and put a

17:21.742 --> 17:51.411
million dollar house next door it won't work I 
don't care what the social scientists tell you it

17:21.742 --> 17:51.411
might work it won't work so we designed what you 
call the Pollyanna effort that's where you took a

17:21.742 --> 17:51.411
$40,000 to $70,000 house it's 30, 40 in this 
cul-de-sac and a layer of trees, and then you put

17:52.100 --> 17:59.709
the semi to $100,000 houses, a layer of trees, and 
so on, until you find you've got a billion-dollar

17:52.100 --> 17:59.709
house. Every village has a whole cross-section. 
And they all go to the same school, same shopping

18:02.773 --> 18:05.616
area. Now, that's the concept of the woodland that 
we're able to put out because we're able to use the

18:05.636 --> 18:12.645
forest to help us do that. And that's the concept 
that I'm trying to work here. Now, I would say this.

18:18.312 --> 18:20.875
My median price has gone up higher than I'd like to 
see it. I'm trying to push it down now that the RTC

18:21.108 --> 18:26.316
has stopped all these give-away sales, where then 
we can do it. Because our value stayed pretty good

18:26.336 --> 18:27.858
for once. And all this downturn, our value may have 
lost 8% to 10%, not 30%, 40%. And they already

18:33.125 --> 18:39.435
bounced back and created big demand for sales of 
used houses at this time, and resale houses now.

18:40.296 --> 18:41.538
Because the values have been here. That's one 
thing that has changed. Houston would buy a house

18:45.143 --> 18:49.309
in every little subdivision around the town. They 
don't do that anymore. Well, we had in 1982 about 2%

18:51.842 --> 18:54.825
of the Houston market. We now have 8.5% of the 
Houston market, because they feel the security is

18:54.845 --> 19:09.200
here, the quality of life is here, the job 
opportunity is here, the access to Houston is very

18:54.845 --> 19:09.200
good, and therefore we have a great impact on the 
whole urbanization process. And there, when

19:09.900 --> 19:14.385
Houston gets to be, the key is, when Houston gets to 
be 6 million people, which it will be, How do we do it

19:15.007 --> 19:16.369
better? That's the whole concept of the 
woodlands. Is that percentage holding up for jobs

19:17.811 --> 19:20.455
also? Oh, yeah, jobs are really, we're up 8,500 
jobs right at this time in the woodlands. I would

19:26.924 --> 19:30.409
say our percentage is pretty good. I don't know 
exactly. We relate percentage of people living in

19:31.490 --> 19:33.593
the woodlands. We have 11,000 households in the 
woodlands. We've got 8,600 jobs. That's not bad.

19:38.380 --> 19:44.929
We hope to have eventually a percentage of 100,000 
jobs, 150,000 people, so the percentage is not too

19:38.380 --> 19:44.929
far from the original concept. But if you're 
asking whether the Woodlands has 8.8% of the

19:46.023 --> 19:54.038
Houston job market, is that what your question is? 
Oh, no, we don't have that. No, we don't have that. A

19:55.721 --> 19:58.847
new growth we may have, you see. But our growth is of 
8.8% of new housing, not resale housing. And I'm

20:06.561 --> 20:09.246
not so sure of our jobs are picked up from 7,000, 
8,500 the last couple of years, so I don't know what

20:09.985 --> 20:14.932
that percentage is compared to total job pick-up. 
Houston total job pick-up has been about 60,000 a

20:14.972 --> 20:25.768
year for the last two years, so if you took 8% of 
that, that would be about, I'm not so sure, we're

20:14.972 --> 20:25.768
pretty close to that. If we went from 7,000 to 8,500 
jobs, And a Houston pick-up of jobs was about

20:28.801 --> 20:35.791
$50,000, $60,000 one year, and $40,000 the other 
day, $100,000, and 8% of that would be $800,000. So

20:35.852 --> 20:36.773
we picked up more than that. We picked up more than 
that. So your rate is ahead of the Houston rate. Our

20:38.916 --> 20:41.260
rate, our ratio probably is ahead of the Houston 
ratio. I'm just going to give you a guess. I'd like

20:42.522 --> 20:45.306
to run the numbers for you, but that's a guess. So 
that's working pretty well. But we have built an

20:46.688 --> 20:50.854
opportunity for different types of jobs. Office 
space, high technology, service industries.

20:57.286 --> 21:24.593
therefore these and working with use advanced 
research center to figure out how the fallout

20:57.286 --> 21:24.593
could be on that how we work with venture capital 
coming which we helped defend someone here so it's

20:57.286 --> 21:24.593
all all in here that you don't find it clear lake you 
don't find it one colony you don't find the rest and

20:57.286 --> 21:24.593
you don't find it come up you don't find it west lake 
you don't find urban now that's that's why it's

20:57.286 --> 21:24.593
different then the key to the woodland is the 
beauty that we're able to preserve so far that i

20:57.286 --> 21:24.593
think is why people I keep saying, gee, it's the 
best place I've ever lived. Well, no, no, but the

21:27.256 --> 21:30.520
social structure for the kids have been good. The 
hike and bike trail, we've got over 65 miles now. I

21:32.943 --> 21:35.906
think of hike and bike trails in the woodlands, et 
cetera. And those are things that. Have there been

21:37.829 --> 21:45.138
any surprises along the way in terms of the social 
structures and in terms of the business

21:37.829 --> 21:45.138
developments? Well, I think that the church has 
done a good job through the interfaith group.

21:49.964 --> 21:52.707
We've had an amazing reaction among the church 
groups that come into Woodlands, they all help

21:53.092 --> 21:56.757
each other get started. It's really worked better 
than I thought. We thought about ecumenical

21:59.420 --> 22:02.664
churches to begin with. Well, you'll notice in the 
book, we felt that wouldn't work. Churches this

22:05.568 --> 22:08.632
competitive is like people are. But what has 
happened, the Native faith has worked with them.

22:12.176 --> 22:14.199
We have some 20 churches or so here now. There's 
been sharing of facilities. Sharing of

22:16.382 --> 22:17.363
facilities. And yet, as they get bigger, it's 
going to get more difficult, as you know, the whole

22:17.824 --> 22:21.228
thing. I think that... Yeah, there are a lot of 
surprises, like where we were disappointed when

22:23.635 --> 22:32.809
we had the University of Houston line up and come up 
with their north campus. But we're going to get a

22:33.149 --> 22:37.956
rather reduced size north campus, because they 
couldn't get it over. We've been sitting out there

22:38.898 --> 22:42.022
waiting for 20 years now. And when I first went 
through the wood in the 69 with them, where they

22:43.064 --> 22:47.751
said, OK, we'll make a deal with you. The boarding 
board said you'll have a south campus, which was

22:47.771 --> 22:52.478
going to be Clear Lake, and a north campus. Well, 
they backed off now when they took the downtown

22:52.593 --> 22:54.915
campus on it. They said, well, that's your other 
campus. I heard us, you see. So, however, we're

22:57.878 --> 23:00.120
going to get something out of it. Has the transfer 
of authority to the local community gone pretty

23:00.300 --> 23:04.724
much according to the? I would say it hadn't gone to 
us. We still control the WCA. However, we lose

23:09.609 --> 23:11.871
control in 92. I'd say if one thing that we wish we'd 
have done better is that since our pace is not as

23:12.711 --> 23:22.060
what it was, I would have liked to have had another 
10 years to have control of the WCA, but we think we

23:22.512 --> 23:26.458
can work with them. We work with Conroe and 
Montgomery County. We can work with them as long as

23:28.601 --> 23:30.363
you do a good job. And I think that they should be 
watchdogs of what's best for the community. Oh,

23:34.870 --> 23:45.485
that's one of the brilliant things that was done is 
the fact that impregnated into the social

23:34.870 --> 23:45.485
structure is, in fact, the values, the 
philosophical values of the Woodlands. Because

23:45.545 --> 23:50.292
as I've talked to various individuals, one of the 
questions I've asked is, what happens when the

23:50.660 --> 23:53.944
hand of George Mitchell is not on the helm? How will 
this continue? And everyone says, it won't

23:56.266 --> 23:57.628
continue. It's not a problem. Yeah, really, 
they've been indoctrinated pretty well. And I

24:00.832 --> 24:02.454
think it's worked real well. As you get up to 
100,000 people, I can't predict what will happen.

24:07.640 --> 24:13.166
But I do think that if you go to 6 million people in 
Houston region, which it will in the next 25 years.

24:14.087 --> 24:16.650
In fact, we even tried thinking about back late 69, 
70, working with Ann McCarg, who did our

24:17.761 --> 24:33.155
environmental planning, to do what I call the 
String of Pearls, where we would really have five

24:17.761 --> 24:33.155
projects similar with a different size, 
different character, within all of the beauty of

24:17.761 --> 24:33.155
southern Montgomery County and the city here. So 
you think that might be a future for the... No, no,

24:33.196 --> 24:36.599
we're still working on it. But I gave up when things 
got tough. I didn't have time for it. But we, McCarg

24:39.201 --> 24:42.644
and I, worked on the idea, and he wanted to do it. So 
we now have our people looking at what would be like

24:42.684 --> 24:45.427
for wood trace. We're getting ready to do one now. 
They're compact, 2,800 acres. A bit different,

24:48.747 --> 24:50.329
1,800 acres. You'll never do 125,000 acres again. 
I don't know who could put this block together. 300

24:54.675 --> 24:58.000
transactions put the block together. So the 
string of pearls still has a lot of interest to me.

25:00.344 --> 25:11.039
How do you really make the whole 6 million people 
work together and have transportation and have

25:00.344 --> 25:11.039
the orientation that makes it work better than 
what's going on in the rest of the country? That's

25:11.059 --> 25:11.680
interesting. One thing you're saying, too, is the 
future for the Woodlands Corporation far beyond

25:11.862 --> 25:16.510
the Woodlands. Far beyond the Woodlands. I'm 
thinking about all of Houston. And really, I'm

25:19.094 --> 25:21.458
thinking about urbanization in the country. Not 
only this state, but all other states. You think

25:24.843 --> 25:33.056
about why do you have the horrible mess you have in 
New York City with 100 political subdivisions or

25:24.843 --> 25:33.056
Washington or Detroit? We might be able to avoid 
that if we work together. And you may not. What we

25:38.744 --> 25:43.509
think would be wrong, because there'd be a lot of 
other things that come up that we never saw for

25:38.744 --> 25:43.509
some. But I do think the idea of how you really 
urbanize better, if you think people are all going

25:43.529 --> 25:53.078
to move inside the loop in Houston, I don't believe 
that. Because if you offer all this opportunity of

25:54.740 --> 26:03.789
job base and everything else, and yet tie into the 
cultural base, or the airport base, or the port

25:54.740 --> 26:03.789
base, that's what I think you have to do. And then we 
argue about trying to match transit now. But the

26:07.145 --> 26:16.579
mass transit used to know how to think about the 
overall plan, not just go from the Galleria

26:07.145 --> 26:16.579
downtown, which is ridiculous. Two billion 
dollars, or a billion and one, they ought to go to

26:17.020 --> 26:20.605
the hospital. But then how do you really tie the six 
billion people you're going to have together with

26:21.346 --> 26:34.165
commuter things and then inline rails, I mean, to 
the airport certainly and a few other places, or

26:21.346 --> 26:34.165
maybe Galleria then. But how do you look at the 
whole? And they're not looking at that whole. It

26:38.273 --> 26:38.834
bothers me. I'm on the executive committee. I 
fought hard to do it a different way, but we've had

26:39.955 --> 26:43.339
one. But you don't have to have light rail as time 
goes on. I agree with that, the rail. And with the

26:49.588 --> 26:53.773
mobility of the freeway systems, and the world is 
just part of it. So my concern is that how do we

26:55.055 --> 26:58.059
urbanize 6 million people? How do you do a better 
job than the rest of the country? So I think that's a

27:02.545 --> 27:07.632
good example of just being an example. For the 
next, let's sort of project ahead, for the next

27:07.652 --> 27:17.604
five years, ten years, and so forth, where do you 
see the main focus of your activities and the

27:07.652 --> 27:17.604
Woodlands activities, say, in the next five 
years? I notice you're building 970 new units,

27:17.624 --> 27:22.190
housing units? Yeah, we leave the town area, leave 
this area. I would say this, that we're

27:26.436 --> 27:29.700
concentrating on the residential, but I think now 
we're beginning to come alive at the high-tech

27:30.322 --> 27:34.969
area. The search forests are looking very 
promising. Also, the idea that I think the

27:37.894 --> 27:44.945
commercial is going to begin to build this way, 
because it follows the people. Office space will

27:44.965 --> 27:47.990
begin to build this way. There'll be more 
headquarter companies coming here with quality

27:48.030 --> 27:51.115
of life. And that all should happen within the next 
five years. You see a lot. That's right. We see a lot

27:54.667 --> 27:55.328
of that. We think that we begin to see we're going to 
get the mall put together, we hope, in the next six

27:55.348 --> 28:01.577
months or so to get the mall started. We see 
additional offers. Right now, you cannot bill an

28:04.161 --> 28:08.087
office building at what price they'll offer you. 
There's no billing unless you can afford to build a

28:08.207 --> 28:10.411
new one. But that's getting to the point now where 
it's just about to break over. So we'll get more of

28:13.936 --> 28:15.258
that. Our apartments are very hot. Our apartments 
are 95% leased up. We're going to do more

28:18.363 --> 28:19.785
apartments. To get to 54,000 units, you have to do 
more cluster housing, townhouses and

28:20.491 --> 28:28.603
apartments, and still preserve 7,000 acres of the 
Greenbelts. And the thing is that, so those are

28:30.225 --> 28:39.038
things that I think the next five and ten years 
should begin to show, well, this project is really

28:30.225 --> 28:39.038
going to be economically viable. People 
certainly doubt it, and still, it's doing well on

28:40.080 --> 28:48.372
land development, but still all the 
infrastructure has to show it makes economic

28:40.080 --> 28:48.372
viability, you see. So we think that we do. And 
then, mainly, also working with the 32,000 people

28:50.542 --> 28:56.491
in the 40,000 and 50,000. How do you really work the 
relation of what we're trying to do to have it keep

28:56.551 --> 29:03.661
going on and yet correct something that we know 
we've done wrong? Do you think simply the shared

29:03.681 --> 29:13.254
growth is going to markedly alter the complexion 
of the women? I think it changes the complexion.

29:14.963 --> 29:18.068
But what's really happened in the last 10 years, we 
didn't predict. We created the Houston Advanced

29:18.128 --> 29:20.291
Research Center. I thought I'd have a University 
of Houston site. I didn't get that one. OK, so that

29:23.456 --> 29:25.839
was one of the surprises that came along. But then 
we decided to say an intellectual center is still

29:26.180 --> 29:30.767
going to be an intellectual center. So we worked 
the Houston Advanced Research. And when I got all

29:32.609 --> 29:38.218
four universities to work with us, we're not 
teasing whether or not they do the research. So our

29:38.238 --> 29:42.304
research ambition has really, really 
skyrocketed. Because I think the technology

29:42.655 --> 29:49.245
transfer is so important for the future of the 
state. When we say, well, depletion and land

29:49.265 --> 29:58.919
depletion can't sustain the whole state, we'd 
better get better adapted to get your technology

29:49.265 --> 29:58.919
into the marketplace, which is what the park is 
supposed to do. So maybe this is a richer and more

29:59.220 --> 30:05.289
unique environment than the one you originally 
conceived of in terms of academics. I think it will

30:05.309 --> 30:05.910
be. I would say that if you're not careful, it would 
be an elitist environment. You don't want to talk

30:08.514 --> 30:09.836
completely, you see. So you want to be sure that you 
have As I say, the old cross-section of

30:11.630 --> 30:16.695
socioeconomic and ethnic mix as much as possible 
over a period of 50 years. And therefore, we want

30:17.656 --> 30:21.259
the segment of it to be because that's it. But then 
you've got to be careful it's not just strictly all

30:21.279 --> 30:25.403
of that, you see. This string of pearls, as you 
mentioned, intrigued me a lot. But obviously,

30:30.188 --> 30:33.591
there's going to be some differences, not just in 
size. It won't be like it wasn't. You'll never get

30:35.673 --> 30:36.714
one $25,000. You may have $3,000 here, $5,000 
there. You have this concept, maybe near Compact.

30:41.851 --> 30:43.694
You have another concept over on this side here. 
But it's all related and has transportation

30:44.174 --> 30:48.080
related to the central core. Oh, I see. Okay. 
Houston is still your hub, your port, your

30:49.522 --> 30:53.928
airport, your downtown. The whole thing has still 
got to be viable. And that's why I say the commuter

30:56.913 --> 31:00.137
lines ought to be sure that they do that. If you had 
good commuter lines, which I think we'll work out

31:01.159 --> 31:04.704
with the railroads. We're not working on one here. 
We're getting ready to do some things here to tie

31:06.146 --> 31:08.569
in. Because they're going to go to the airport. 
They may do their high-speed train. They're going

31:11.837 --> 31:13.800
to go by A&M. They're talking about . And I think 
this, and they're not even talking about going by

31:14.862 --> 31:17.165
airport. I can't believe we're going to let them 
get over that. Because we're trying to be sure they

31:19.288 --> 31:22.693
touch our airport, too, if they do high-speed 
train. They're going to do Dallas-Fort Worth

31:22.754 --> 31:24.496
there, but not ours. That's what I heard. Yeah, 
that's what I heard. So we're always raising hell

31:26.479 --> 31:27.821
about that. But we were negligent in not getting 
it. We're too busy fighting our own rail battle.

31:31.366 --> 31:33.129
And if we didn't get into that, we should have got in 
earlier. But I mean, I think that the concept I have

31:33.670 --> 31:38.016
is, Why did the nation have all this trouble in 
urbanization, and we got trouble in every big

31:38.705 --> 31:43.733
city? You have riots, you've got all the problems, 
you've got the school system is in chaos. I mean,

31:48.299 --> 31:49.782
just look at it. The nation's going downhill. No 
question about it in my mind. How do you urbanize

31:53.107 --> 31:54.008
better? And this is an example, not just for 
Houston, but for Texas, but for the nation to see

31:55.610 --> 32:05.505
how you urbanize better, and how we take six 
million people and make it better. And you do

32:05.654 --> 32:06.655
otherwise. I have little subdivisions here in the 
downtown going to hell, and they don't give a damn

32:06.895 --> 32:18.689
about the downtown, because they're out there in 
their little enclave, a little political

32:06.895 --> 32:18.689
subdivision, and you try to get tagged to hell with 
you, and they'll probably go use your airport

32:06.895 --> 32:18.689
report. I mean, that's the kind of thing that's 
going on. And so I think the women's is a good

32:21.132 --> 32:24.155
example. It's unique, from what I can tell. And 
it's very well... They should see that. I just saw

32:29.101 --> 32:32.004
it the other day, they won a choice made on new 
towns. Yeah. Have you seen that video we had done? I

32:35.577 --> 32:38.601
saw it on the PBS station. I

32:38.701 --> 32:45.150
had to go to Irvine and Reston and a couple of others 
and listen. It was very, very good. It was very well

32:46.151 --> 32:46.973
done. In fact, she won a bronze, she said, on that 
one for recognition. But the thing is this. Those

32:54.463 --> 32:56.686
are things I think we have to really see. What we're 
saying is a outgrowth of what I saw in the 60s. about

33:02.168 --> 33:03.529
the danger of our cities. And this is what the 
Woodlands is about. Is your tape still running? Is

33:07.774 --> 33:08.875
it a four and a half hour tape? Yeah, it's 45 
minutes. OK. But you feel like the Woodlands has

33:13.460 --> 33:17.264
pretty well met your expectations. It is. It has 
also been on the- Rainy growth is slow because you

33:18.285 --> 33:23.451
had three high interest rates peaks and you had a 
downturn in Houston. But still, it's certainly

33:23.791 --> 33:25.914
done very well. And residents are doing well. 
We're the leaders now. Our prices are quite good.

33:31.447 --> 33:40.741
We are now, I would say, poised to really do the high 
technology thing, do the university bit with the

33:31.447 --> 33:40.741
community college. We're poised to get the 
shopping mall and also more office space up here.

33:46.008 --> 33:49.193
We tied into Houston better with the toll road and 
the airport. So I think that we're really right on

33:49.213 --> 33:54.541
the threshold of really very excellent growth in 
the next 10 years. And Houston will probably come

33:54.581 --> 33:56.283
out of the hole. And it's the kind of community you 
hoped it would be. That's right, it is. I tell you

34:00.623 --> 34:06.329
why I know, because I guess we go, Cynthia and I, we 
live out here. But then we go either, and you can't

34:06.349 --> 34:11.374
believe how many people come and say, I live here, I 
live in Connecticut, I live in California. They

34:11.394 --> 34:12.775
know they're going to find us. I've been there 
since they were about, I mean, they were there. And

34:15.818 --> 34:18.440
you can tell, why would people come home and just 
say that? So I guess when you go around and ask

34:19.061 --> 34:23.706
people, you'll find the same thing. And you'll 
find that when you ask people, well, really, what

34:25.007 --> 34:27.690
is it? Is it? Does it match your expectations or 
whatever it is? Which brings me to my last

34:32.008 --> 34:33.771
question. I've asked everybody that we've 
interviewed this question. I've never gotten a

34:36.016 --> 34:37.038
decent answer. Never gotten a good answer. 
Obviously,

34:39.522 --> 34:46.917
there's a lot of self-satisfaction that you get 
out of doing this. Manifestly, you intended to

34:47.398 --> 34:49.682
make money out of it. But you didn't get into this 
just to make money. No. There's more than that.

34:54.739 --> 34:56.582
What really is your motivation? Why are you so 
wedded to the concept of the woodlands? Well,

34:59.566 --> 35:04.673
because of the urbanization problems of the 
nation. In other words, I saw back in the 60s that I

35:04.693 --> 35:08.919
didn't think we were doing the right thing. I think 
we can do a better job. And that's what it's all

35:10.501 --> 35:11.442
about. And then to design it and execute it is a 
difficult task. It really is. To really have a

35:18.873 --> 35:23.699
concept and see if you can get it to work is 
extremely difficult and complex. And we've got a

35:24.480 --> 35:26.803
good team that was part of it. Sir, incidentally, 
that's one thing we have noticed, that the people

35:26.823 --> 35:31.588
you brought in here from the first are still here. 
And I think that's a testimony to that. It is. We've

35:33.931 --> 35:34.832
got a good team. Strength of government space. And 
we're trying to get the best of strength of all the

35:35.493 --> 35:44.804
East Coast and West Coast to bring them in, because 
there wasn't a bunch of knowledgeable people,

35:35.493 --> 35:44.804
architects or planners at that time in the late 
90s, late 60s. So I think this is what...

35:47.645 --> 35:59.476
satisfaction, but I really think that that is why 
it isn't just to make money for Houston, although

35:47.645 --> 35:59.476
it's important for Houston or the state of Texas. I 
think it's a role model that could be used in many

35:59.496 --> 36:13.529
other areas, and that's why I'm trying to get the 
documentary so people study the case history of

35:59.496 --> 36:13.529
this, wherever it is, and say, well, you know, this 
is interesting, and I can use some of these

35:59.496 --> 36:13.529
concepts to build the next generation. We looked 
at Columbia. I looked at every new town. And we

36:16.940 --> 36:18.162
looked at them very clearly. But Columbia was the 
best. I've seen Jim Riles done the best job up to

36:20.204 --> 36:22.247
that time. So we built on what he did to figure out 
how we might do better. That's what it's all about.

36:31.178 --> 36:32.439
Well, I think that's the end of it. Is it fair for me 
to raise a question? Yes, please do. Why don't you

36:34.982 --> 36:39.488
comment about the need the fact that there hasn't 
really been a big hit as far as an industrial

36:40.818 --> 36:50.850
relocation here, something that creates, 
instantly, 300, 400, 500 jobs? Well, it's

36:50.870 --> 36:54.174
difficult because Houston was noted for energy, 
of course. And before we started, Shell had

36:54.995 --> 36:58.299
already done the big thing for the west side. Now, 
the energy corridor did all the work. A lot of

37:03.225 --> 37:04.847
companies went out the west side. We had a few in the 
north side. I mean, we had a few here. But that's

37:07.911 --> 37:09.593
where all the pace was. because energy is 70, 70% of 
our whole life blood up to the last fall down. So if

37:17.727 --> 37:22.814
they already had that, I never could figure out why 
the hell they'd go on the west side and they

37:17.727 --> 37:22.814
couldn't get to the airport. I mean, that always 
puzzled me. Well, we think that'll change because

37:24.356 --> 37:31.366
we're near a town now, the toll road's in, we're 
better shaped than they are at that time. We think

37:31.907 --> 37:32.788
that'll change. However, what you call the 
instinct of, to follow who was out there. The herd

37:40.645 --> 37:42.447
instinct. The lemming instinct, as I call it. 
Yeah, the herd. That's why they did a lot of the big

37:45.490 --> 37:48.993
hits there. And we have some things looking now. 
Now the commercial's going to look good again.

37:53.437 --> 37:57.240
We'll get some big hits for the next year or two. But 
you do not anticipate any mass production, mass

37:57.280 --> 38:01.404
employment type activities? No, I'm not 
interested in 5,000 people or anything. That

38:05.627 --> 38:07.609
really doesn't. I do think that, I don't think we'd 
have the land to do 10,000 to 15,000 people.

38:16.553 --> 38:27.246
But I do think we have land nearby that they could 
live in the woodlands instead of what they have

38:16.553 --> 38:27.246
five, six miles away to build a big thing like 
you're talking about. This is my last question.

38:28.347 --> 38:33.613
What has been your, in terms of personal pleasure, 
I guess, and enjoyment and personal challenge,

38:28.347 --> 38:33.613
energy? Or the woodland. I've often wondered 
that. I think restoring galveston has been

38:36.220 --> 38:38.003
interesting. Yeah, that's undoubtedly 
exciting. I think energy, of course. I haven't

38:41.146 --> 38:43.529
drilled so many wells and so many wildcats. It's 
been a very important thing. And the woodland. I

38:45.792 --> 38:51.119
think really the most important thing I'm working 
on now is to use the Advanced Research Center. It

38:51.139 --> 38:56.986
could be something that... You know, I use this 
parallel, and I'm not... I'm sincere about it.

38:58.047 --> 39:00.470
People don't see it, I guess. I came here when the 
medical center was a prairie. And

39:04.154 --> 39:15.966
it now has 52 institutions, several billion 
dollars of structures, 60,000 people working,

39:04.154 --> 39:15.966
11,000 professionals. The Youth Advanced 
Research Center in 40 years could be that

39:16.567 --> 39:20.310
important to the region. If the full universe 
would work with me. If they don't know how to get it

39:24.034 --> 39:28.539
out of the universities, they don't know how to get 
it out. And therefore, if they'll work with us and

39:28.559 --> 39:31.782
we evolve, And if I get support, see, my problem is I 
have no consistency. I don't have 40,000

39:35.248 --> 39:39.916
graduates like A&M has, or 10,000 at Rice, or U of H, 
30,000. How do we get the foundation to understand

39:41.438 --> 39:43.701
what we're trying to do? We're trying to do the next 
level. Houston Advanced Research Center is the

39:46.105 --> 39:50.492
most important thing I'm working on, of all of 
these things. All the other I've worked on, in my

39:50.512 --> 39:52.976
opinion, if it works. I don't know if it's going to 
work there. How do you really get these four

39:55.720 --> 40:00.688
universities, University of Texas is also 
included, too, A&M, U of H, and Rice, to say, all

40:01.478 --> 40:18.721
right, we're going to build this next level of how 
we take this technology transfer, how the talent

40:01.478 --> 40:18.721
comes out of our universities to help you reach 
this area, this country, to help the country to

40:01.478 --> 40:18.721
start moving ahead on the global competition of 
technology. Now that, I think, is very important.

40:21.004 --> 40:21.365
That's exciting. And that is the most difficult 
thing I have to convince the Foundation of

40:21.385 --> 40:26.912
Houston, because the third generation made all 
that money out of energy. And they put it back in the

40:27.128 --> 40:32.736
HGO, put it back in the ballet, which is good 
because we do that ourselves now. But they should

40:33.357 --> 40:36.401
remember their $500 million fortune came out of 
energy. And they put very little back in

40:37.142 --> 40:39.245
technology of energy. And we've got a big 
technology center over there, and I get very

40:39.265 --> 40:45.754
little support because I can't get them to 
understand what we're trying to do. And this, I

40:46.575 --> 40:55.347
think, is a youth advanced research center really 
is another role model that the nation should use

40:46.575 --> 40:55.347
more of. Now, we're just beginning. It's 
embryonic. It'll take five years to let me tell you

40:58.100 --> 41:01.904
what I think it's going to work on. But so far, it's 
doing quite well. But it's a very small one. We have

41:05.048 --> 41:06.970
to support most of it. And I think that it bothers me 
that I can't get the support, but I can't get the

41:06.990 --> 41:12.316
message out to them. I can't even get A&M to 
understand. Oh, really? I would think President

41:14.939 --> 41:16.201
Mobley would be better. Mobley understands it 
very well, and he wants to help. They're very

41:18.463 --> 41:19.965
protective and jealous. But you see, then I get to 
the dean level down below. Dean says, hell, I can do

41:22.247 --> 41:24.490
it all at College Station. Let me give you a good 
example.

41:29.732 --> 41:31.013
We have that high of this stuff. We did all the basic 
research on superconductor supercollider. I

41:34.337 --> 41:35.418
don't know if people know that here. Peter 
McIntyre, who you probably know at A&M, the one

41:35.899 --> 41:42.086
that came down, did a very interesting story. He 
was the Fermilab for the experiments. And then

41:46.732 --> 41:52.198
they had the big session in Snowmass in 1983. that 
they have every year, all the high-energy

41:52.668 --> 41:58.694
physicists get together to have a workshop. And 
they came up with the superconductor,

41:58.714 --> 42:04.079
supercollider, the most important project that 
should be done in the nation. Then they

42:04.099 --> 42:05.621
reconfirmed it in 84. So Peter says, I'm going to 
get it to Texas. So he comes to talk to Vandiver at

42:09.725 --> 42:12.247
that time. And Vandiver, you've lost your mind. 
That thing's too big for the A&M. Go see Skip Port.

42:18.273 --> 42:20.535
He's over at the experiment station. So he goes to 
Skip Port. And Skip Porter just happened to just

42:23.279 --> 42:25.041
come. We just started hard to come on our board. He 
said, we can't do this thing. That's too big. Go

42:30.247 --> 42:31.429
down and talk to George Mitchell. He's got a full 
university trying to work with him on a consortium

42:31.449 --> 42:38.918
that maybe will be a new project that none of them 
can do individually. So Pete was smart. I don't

42:39.959 --> 42:41.221
know if you heard this story, Joe. He got Glasshaw, 
Sheldon Glasshaw, the developer of the

42:42.042 --> 42:50.151
department, that's coming down with electric 
heating, to come see me. So Sheldon came in the

42:50.172 --> 42:51.413
room. I went to this office downtown at that time. 
Michelle said, I'll tell you what, Mr. Mayor. She

42:58.056 --> 43:00.719
says, we're going to build a texatron. We want you 
to come up with $2 billion, and we're going to find

43:00.739 --> 43:05.705
oil 40 miles below the ground. Zap these 
particles. I said, come on, I'm a geologist. Don't

43:08.209 --> 43:10.051
give me this crap, Michelle. Don't give me this 
crap. What is a ureteron? I said, well, all right,

43:13.575 --> 43:17.721
OK. We're trying to build a texatron. They wanted 
to call it the texatron. We want Texas to happen.

43:20.607 --> 43:22.349
Peter was anxious to do it. He said, what do you do? I 
said, well, what is it, Peter, you think you can put

43:23.491 --> 43:27.196
together? He said, I think I can get the full 
universe that you now have with HAARP just

43:27.237 --> 43:31.242
starting. He said, I got two at Rice. I got one at U of 
H, Ryanstein. I got one at two at A&M. And where can

43:38.273 --> 43:40.136
you put this thing together? And when I get the DOE 
money to do the research on the magnet. I said,

43:44.001 --> 43:45.163
well, Peter, what do you need? He said, well, we 
need a place to work. We need to have a consortia

43:46.886 --> 43:48.568
coming together. and we need $1.6 million of your 
money to help get started. All right, we'll go

43:51.358 --> 43:52.700
ahead and we'll do that for you. So that's where 
they came here to Hark. And then they got the DOE

43:56.344 --> 44:01.651
contract to do the magnet design, the superferg 
magnet, which they didn't accept. I mean, which we

44:01.912 --> 44:05.436
did everything it's supposed to, but they picked a 
more technical magnet. They still haven't held

44:05.796 --> 44:06.998
making it work. I was going to say, it doesn't work. 
It doesn't work. We got really got eggs on our face.

44:11.604 --> 44:13.606
But anyway, so what happened then? Then we got 
Governor White. I was on a science and technology

44:16.882 --> 44:19.967
committee with Skip. Skip came to the president at 
that time of the park. We went and met in front of 16

44:23.793 --> 44:28.421
people of the science and technology committee, 
and none of them understand what the hell we're

44:23.793 --> 44:28.421
talking about. None of them knew a damn thing about 
it. So Governor White said, all right, I'll give

44:30.985 --> 44:35.852
you $400,000 to do the siting studies between the 
four universities. So we had Bureau of Economic

44:36.013 --> 44:42.563
Geology work with us and all the other 
institutions, look at 14 sites we picked around

44:36.013 --> 44:42.563
the state. And then we did that work. Then we got the 
state to put the billion dollar issue, and we

44:43.983 --> 44:47.908
helped light the bill. We educated, then when 
White was gone, Clemens came in, he called Skip, he

44:50.592 --> 44:59.464
said, come up and tell him what the hell this SSC is 
all about. So Skip went up there and spent four

44:59.484 --> 45:01.947
hours with him. He didn't know a damn thing about 
it. He said, hell, we're going to get this deal.

45:04.791 --> 45:05.451
That's what Clemens said. Now here we are, four 
universities, with not over eight or ten

45:06.713 --> 45:11.880
high-energy scientists, competing against 
Fermi Lab with 250 scientists, with Berkeley with

45:12.333 --> 45:21.167
another 150 scientists, with Brookhaven with 
another 150 scientists, and 35 states, and win.

45:22.549 --> 45:26.295
How did we win that $8 billion project, which went 
to Washington? It was just fine. We knew it was a

45:27.116 --> 45:29.961
good sign, and we had other signs. How in the hell 
did Texas win that thing? Because we, had we not

45:31.563 --> 45:33.987
done the work and hard Texas wouldn't have been in 
the competition. They wouldn't have known what to

45:36.697 --> 45:37.639
do. It's there. We have some documents on that 
we're going to include in the... It's very

45:41.126 --> 45:41.968
important. In fact, Skip will give you, after we 
finally won the award for Texas, I had them all get

45:41.988 --> 45:47.520
together for four hours. brains of Peter, and we 
brainstormed the chronology. I have that. We have

45:51.578 --> 45:52.198
that. We will include it in this book. And the 
governor gave us a big award. He gave me one, and

45:56.123 --> 46:01.330
gave Peter McIntyre one, and Russ Hewson an award 
for bringing the SSC to Texas. Now, it isn't the SSC

46:01.971 --> 46:04.774
to Texas. It's how did we do it? How did the 
entrepreneurship gall to think that this little

46:07.437 --> 46:15.347
embryonic group of eight high-energy physicists 
could beat the 35 states and all these great

46:15.732 --> 46:18.797
institutions around the country. Now, that's the 
message that you have to carry on that, is really

46:19.458 --> 46:23.264
how these things are done. So this is the story of 
the SSC. And that's why the Houston Advanced

46:26.189 --> 46:33.060
Research Center could be one of the most important 
things we have in this region. If I get the support

46:33.941 --> 46:39.630
of the universities, which I have locally in 
Cunningham, I make the meetings, I have them. But

46:40.083 --> 46:42.906
when I get to the Dean's on down, then that's where 
it comes. But I'll tell you the story that's

46:43.046 --> 46:48.332
interesting, too, about why the wood is 
important. So in this area, Ann M. called me one

46:48.352 --> 46:53.217
day. I'll tell you what. I just hired. This is going 
to run out in just a minute. I'm going to flip it

46:59.423 --> 47:00.244
over. In fact, let me go ahead and do that right now 
before you tell that story.
