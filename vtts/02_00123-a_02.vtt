WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:04.320
by runner, by messenger.

00:07.423 --> 00:12.288
And they didn't have near the number of radios and things like that that we did.

00:12.489 --> 00:27.625
So they were, I'd say, considerably there, other than the

00:28.735 --> 00:30.237
in the automatic weapons.

00:30.257 --> 00:38.951
Now they believed in firepower and not in aimed fire.

00:39.792 --> 00:49.507
This was one of the biggest difference between us and the British even, but more so between us and the Russians.

00:49.527 --> 00:52.431
The Russians nearly all of them had

00:53.710 --> 00:58.136
Automatic weapons, particularly submachine guns are typical.

00:59.097 --> 01:16.460
I don't know what the name of them was, but they, you know, had the round magazine on them that, and they fired lots of, lots of ammunition, but not, they didn't use much anything to fire.

01:17.802 --> 01:21.827
Did you all ever have any problems with the Russians, men?

01:22.921 --> 01:25.224
Well, I kind of defend them now.

01:26.645 --> 01:44.105
The biggest problem was it was not long after the fighting was over till it was evident that there was a conflict in philosophy.

01:44.265 --> 01:49.992
We just didn't think like the Russians, particularly in dealing with the German people.

01:50.360 --> 02:00.854
Of course, we had not had Leningrad and some of the other things that weren't too favorable to the Germans.

02:01.094 --> 02:15.954
And the Russians were, with some justification, they didn't like the Germans any at all.

02:16.615 --> 02:20.080
One of the biggest, one of the things that we would encounter

02:20.903 --> 02:43.449
Of course, after we broke through the Siegfried mine and got into the heart of German property, we didn't have any, other than just minor skirmishes, we didn't have any real tough hand-to-hand type fighting.

02:45.571 --> 02:50.016
If normally we could, anything we ran into,

02:50.570 --> 03:03.385
massing enough artillery, firepower, calling enough air force, we had more airplanes over there than we knew what to do with it, really.

03:03.405 --> 03:14.137
Another thing that was kind of interesting over there was the first time that I ever saw a jet airplane.

03:14.157 --> 03:18.602
The Germans sent two jets over to

03:21.012 --> 03:33.426
bomb the bridge that we, we put in two bridges across the River, and they sent two, two jets over there to destroy that bridge.

03:34.107 --> 03:50.665
Well, these jets had so much speed that the Germans didn't know how to use it, so they couldn't drop the bomb within 500 yards, except by accident of where they aimed it, because they didn't have any way of, they just,

03:51.438 --> 03:58.028
over and dropped the bomb and hoped it hit something.

03:58.049 --> 04:10.268
But we had a battalion anti-aircraft attached to us, which had twin 40 millimeter anti-aircraft, and they were good.

04:12.151 --> 04:19.723
If a plane came over within eight to ten thousand feet or lower, they didn't miss it

04:21.205 --> 04:29.895
The only way that the plane got over us was flying above the range of the guns that they had.

04:29.915 --> 04:48.175
But this, this colonel of this anti-aircraft battalion, I don't remember his name, he's a big, tall, slender, red-headed fellow, but he came in almost shaking in his boots after the raid by the Germans with each jet aircraft.

04:48.796 --> 04:55.285
because he says these planes are flying faster than I can track them with these, or our gunners can track them.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.550
And I don't know what we're going to do.

04:59.411 --> 05:06.020
We just have to guess at where they might be and hope we've got a gun pointed in that direction.

05:06.781 --> 05:18.718
But our early control, the way we controlled the jet, the combat, the jet aircraft, the Germans,

05:19.441 --> 05:22.244
were just mass planes.

05:22.784 --> 05:35.017
We had so many planes in the air that we'd just box in, just build them, just circle the plane, put enough up above them to where they, and run them out of fuel.

05:36.919 --> 05:47.130
They couldn't, if they started to go through there, they had this much firepower there, they could, and that, that was, uh.

05:47.450 --> 05:49.212
How, uh, once the war is over,

05:49.327 --> 05:52.512
What was it like to be part of the occupation force?

05:53.914 --> 05:57.259
How did the Germans react, and how did you all relate to them?

05:58.661 --> 06:14.524
Well, the Germans, of course, were very organized kind of people, and it wasn't long before they had some semblance of control of their people.

06:15.432 --> 06:33.120
I mean they they had they've got records of where people are and where their families came from and what kind of work they did and anybody that came in there they they assigned them housing and they what our we had we had a

06:33.792 --> 06:36.096
two or three main objectives.

06:36.857 --> 06:59.412
One was to keep the infrastructure working, the water system, the sewer system, to see that there was enough coal, generally speaking, to fire the generators, which was of course the key to keeping the water system and most everything else running, and we tried to

07:00.286 --> 07:08.016
get the railroads, and did get the railroads back into operation, so he could move some of the basic foods around there.

07:10.339 --> 07:19.732
Germans were low on food, but of course we were bringing food products and everything else in by big bunches.

07:19.812 --> 07:29.365
The problem was moving it, but it wasn't long before the, once the Germans saw what we were trying to do, well they had people to

07:29.598 --> 07:41.832
meat trucks and trains and other things and move this and put it out and instigate a distribution system that worked.

07:44.375 --> 07:54.407
I was not involved and as I recall it there was little or no crime or anything of that there wasn't any stealing or

07:55.062 --> 08:00.007
Fievery, or killings, or anything like that, that I'm aware of.

08:01.728 --> 08:11.237
So it was not a, not, it wasn't too tough in that respect.

08:12.278 --> 08:21.407
So I stayed there, of course the fighting was over in, I believe May, four or five, essentially, and it was,

08:22.113 --> 08:26.760
It's December of 45 before I came home, so.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.142
Then you're discharged?

08:28.723 --> 08:31.326
Yeah, I came home and landed it.

08:32.188 --> 08:36.374
Came home on a victory ship.

08:36.394 --> 08:42.242
Left France, Marseille, France, and came through the Straits of Gibraltar.

08:43.604 --> 08:45.707
Now this is in early January.

08:46.463 --> 08:56.775
and we headed across the North Atlantic and we ran into a storm where the waves were 60 feet high at least.

08:56.975 --> 09:03.582
You looked out and you know 30-40 feet up above the ship at the top of these waves.

09:04.363 --> 09:09.349
It was so cold that all the rigging on the ship, ice froze over

09:09.953 --> 09:24.375
the cables and lines and things on the ship got to be three or four inches in diameter and the storm got so bad that they finally backed out of it and we detoured about 1,500 miles to the south around the storm.

09:25.516 --> 09:36.653
So we were at sea another ten days or so longer than a normal trip across, but we landed in Hampton Roads in Virginia.

09:37.848 --> 09:44.679
stayed there a few days and then came I was discharged from Camp Maxie.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.083
How did you get railroad?

09:47.463 --> 10:04.530
Yeah I was I was in charge of about 12-15 soldiers of different places most of them coming back to Texas but there was a few of them getting off in Arkansas and some other places they didn't have anything to do but just carry the paperwork and

10:06.721 --> 10:11.266
And so you're coming back to Kasey or to Bay City?

10:11.606 --> 10:13.048
Well, neither one.

10:15.070 --> 10:17.272
My dad's still working for J.S.

10:17.372 --> 10:20.896
Abercrombie, but he was building wells down in the valley.

10:20.916 --> 10:21.617
Okay.

10:21.637 --> 10:36.492
And my other dad was living in Harlington, and my mother was teaching school down there on a temporary teacher certificate because of the shortage of teachers.

10:38.800 --> 10:55.959
So I came into Camp Fanning, caught a bus and went into Dallas, visited an ant there in Dallas for a day or two, and then flew a DC-3 down to Harlan.

10:57.661 --> 11:02.226
And stayed down there for, I don't know, a month or so.

11:03.117 --> 11:09.924
did a little visiting around and I came back to Bay City and went back to work with John Roethere on survey group.

11:09.944 --> 11:11.426
Okay.

11:11.446 --> 11:19.214
And this was this was in the late winter of 46.

11:19.435 --> 11:27.083
You have any idea what your pay was in 46?

11:31.180 --> 11:32.462
No, I don't.

11:32.722 --> 11:46.683
It, it is probably two and a half an hour or something like that.

11:46.703 --> 11:59.162
Uh, it wasn't, I didn't work that way very long until they started a, uh, a new irrigation project down at, uh, Portavaca.

12:00.931 --> 12:14.243
And I moved down to Port Lavaca, and we set up an office down there and kind of entered into a kind of a loose partnership, John, John Rother and I. And I ran that on there.

12:14.263 --> 12:14.944
Spell his name.

12:15.344 --> 12:16.845
R-O-T-H-E-R.

12:20.508 --> 12:24.952
A hundred and ten percent German.

12:24.972 --> 12:25.153
Mm-hmm.

12:25.173 --> 12:28.095
Yeah, well, you're, you're German, aren't you?

12:28.115 --> 12:30.077
It is, yeah.

12:32.707 --> 12:41.017
Many of the people down there, particularly in the farming and ranching area in that part of the country, were German.

12:42.018 --> 12:58.056
And this was back during the time when you went out and worked for, did survey work for a German family, about 10 o'clock in the morning when they brought out a meal for you almost.

12:59.082 --> 13:08.432
sandwiches and bread and butter and ham and cookies and cake and milk and whatever.

13:09.994 --> 13:14.219
When did you start thinking about going to Texas A&M?

13:14.239 --> 13:24.550
Well when I graduated from high school we never did go hungry but we didn't have any money.

13:27.179 --> 13:29.982
and when I say any, that's what I'm talking about.

13:31.984 --> 13:36.028
I could not afford to go, to do anything but go to work.

13:39.011 --> 13:52.765
After I came back, went, went back to work, John Rose, who went down to Port Rebecca and put in this irrigation system down there, and a lot of the rice farmers,

13:53.200 --> 14:18.718
who had formed in the Bay City area moved down there to that burgeon land and put in new land well all this had to be contoured and had to be canals run and all this so we did a lot of I did we did a lot of survey and some engineering down there after that was over there wasn't too much work

14:20.504 --> 14:23.328
going on there, and I moved back up to Bay City.

14:24.349 --> 14:26.452
And then I went to work for J.S.

14:26.472 --> 14:35.463
Abercrombie in their survey department over at Sweeney.

14:35.523 --> 14:43.193
They were running pipelines and doing these surveys and making well locations, so I went to work on there.

14:44.635 --> 14:48.199
Left John went to work on their survey crew.

14:49.951 --> 15:04.571
I had met Flores, I guess, I don't know, early 48, 47 maybe.

15:05.833 --> 15:09.718
Anyway, in February of 49, we got married.

15:11.220 --> 15:14.204
And I was working, still working at ASF probably.

15:15.206 --> 15:19.131
And I was making $2.85 an hour, I remember that.

15:19.516 --> 15:22.639
when I got married.

15:22.659 --> 15:30.708
At that point in time, Abercrombie was talking about selling out, which he later did.

15:32.310 --> 15:34.432
So I began to think.

15:34.633 --> 15:42.982
First place I'd gotten as high up as I could go with the education that I had in working for Abercrombie.

15:44.083 --> 15:47.667
And at that point in time, it was, it was a pretty fair job.

15:49.705 --> 16:09.015
Uh, in the, so got married in the summer of 49, or early spring of 49, I guess it was, I took the examination to become licensed, to get my license as a, as a state licensed land surveyor.

16:12.360 --> 16:17.147
Then there was a little more talk about Abercrombie selling out, so Floris and I

16:17.684 --> 16:18.726
got to talking.

16:18.746 --> 16:25.976
They said, well, maybe I could go to school on the GI Bill and she could come and go to work at A&M maybe.

16:27.559 --> 16:32.125
She said, I will go up there to A&M and I'll see if I can get a job.

16:33.948 --> 16:40.878
And then in September, well you can see if you apply for A&M and in September you can move up there.

16:40.898 --> 16:43.162
So that's the way it worked.

16:43.182 --> 16:47.488
She came up here and

16:49.156 --> 16:57.426
Got a job at A&M in the agriculture department.

16:57.446 --> 17:11.623
Stayed at the old Blue Top Courts, which is over about where Best Buy and Red Lobster and all that is over right now.

17:11.643 --> 17:15.147
And I applied early and been accepted to A&M.

17:17.202 --> 17:43.471
in September I came up here and we moved out to the Annex all the freshmen were all out at the Annex and the only place to stay out there was A&M furnished married student housing in the old bachelor officers quarters on the air base out there.

17:43.491 --> 17:46.534
About how many married students were there?

17:47.037 --> 18:12.167
they were probably staying out there there was less than a dozen but a an apartment consisted of one room about about the size of that living room and probably about six the whole thing was about sixteen feet no twenty feet square

18:13.767 --> 18:24.462
If you can imagine cutting a line across that and making a two rooms ten by twenty.

18:27.927 --> 18:31.192
The front part of that would have been the living room.

18:33.114 --> 18:38.442
Now the back half of that cut that half in two and you had two ten by ten.

18:39.468 --> 18:44.453
One of them was a bedroom, and the other was a kitchen dining room.

18:44.473 --> 18:49.559
Now, there was no running water in the building, and no bathroom.

18:51.141 --> 19:03.634
Down at the end of the street was a latrine, officer's latrine had been there, and about a block over was another one, and they made one of them was women, and one of them was men.

19:06.257 --> 19:09.340
So, Forrest and I moved in there.

19:10.754 --> 19:11.976
Do you remember what it cost?

19:15.861 --> 19:16.802
No, I don't.

19:16.923 --> 19:21.929
But I really don't remember paying anything for it.

19:21.949 --> 19:23.391
But it must have been a little something.

19:23.411 --> 19:26.195
I'd say probably less than $10 a month.

19:26.836 --> 19:29.260
So was there even a sink?

19:29.280 --> 19:38.292
So you could bring water and... They had a cabinet unit that was prefabricated.

19:38.312 --> 19:39.073
And it had...

19:39.475 --> 19:51.567
a sink in the middle here and it had above the sink it was two two cabinets that opened up and down below there was a place where you could put pots and pans.

19:52.888 --> 19:55.611
Now it did have electricity.

19:55.631 --> 19:58.994
Was it was it furnished with was there some furniture?

19:59.495 --> 19:59.555
No.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.657
You had to bring your own okay.

20:01.677 --> 20:06.141
We had a we had an electric roaster

20:08.888 --> 20:19.863
a toaster, and an electric skillet, an electric coffee pot.

20:19.883 --> 20:31.740
Now, you could run two of those appliances at the time, all right, but if you turn the other one on, it threw the breaker in there, so you couldn't, you had to be careful.

20:32.841 --> 20:34.744
So, you're saying y'all had no stove?

20:36.597 --> 20:38.239
there was no cook stove.

20:38.259 --> 20:38.920
That's what I mean.

20:38.940 --> 20:40.301
There was a space heater.

20:40.421 --> 20:41.783
Yeah, but no cook stove.

20:41.803 --> 20:45.146
In the living room part of this to keep warm by.

20:45.447 --> 20:53.456
Now the partitions in there that I was talking about liked about 18 inches reaching the floor and about 18 inches reaching the ceiling.

20:53.976 --> 20:58.001
So one space heater heated the whole thing.

20:59.662 --> 21:04.748
What I did, we were at the, in the apartment

21:05.082 --> 21:32.338
closest to the men's latrine which was about 75 feet away I guess outside the latrine there was a water faucet just like a lawn faucet I bought a hundred feet of quarter inch copper line went out there and dug up that faucet

21:32.960 --> 21:39.768
took the elbow off of it, put a T in there, and there was a connection that would fit that faucet.

21:39.788 --> 21:46.876
Dug me a little trench about six or eight inches deep, run that copper line around and ran it up through the house.

21:47.898 --> 21:55.246
And then I connected a garden hose and ran it from the sink out into the ditch on the road out there.

21:55.306 --> 21:59.271
So we had to be careful what we put in the sink.

21:59.723 --> 22:06.612
But you could kind of wash dishes and whatnot there, and we did have cold water, of course.

22:06.632 --> 22:10.657
Did you ask any official permission to put that line, that connection in?

22:10.898 --> 22:15.163
No, I just did it one Saturday afternoon when there wasn't many folks around.

22:15.324 --> 22:23.074
And when we left there, I took that wire up and put the line back just like it was.

22:23.975 --> 22:25.777
Now, that was for one semester.

22:25.797 --> 22:29.342
The next semester, we moved up into...

22:30.217 --> 22:42.334
housing by the, which was duplexes, up by the gate, which had been base housing at the Air Force Base, and that's where these were nice quarters.

22:43.075 --> 22:47.962
How were y'all, when you first arrived out at the base, how were you received?

22:48.043 --> 22:55.233
Was there any kind of, and how did you get that particular place to live?

22:55.293 --> 22:57.456
Did somebody take you over there and show you, or what?

22:58.111 --> 23:04.179
Yeah, they took us over and they said, here, we've got a whole row of these buildings, which one do you want apartments here?

23:04.759 --> 23:08.564
Of course, we took one down closest to the latrine.

23:08.584 --> 23:15.693
Now, you were a veteran, and about how many veterans were there in the freshman that year?

23:17.435 --> 23:18.076
I don't know.

23:19.137 --> 23:27.628
The majority of the veterans had returned back and finished their education.

23:27.946 --> 23:28.988
By 1949.

23:29.469 --> 23:30.231
That's what I thought.

23:30.371 --> 23:34.960
There was a good many of them had already completed their education and was gone.

23:35.100 --> 23:42.134
I'm going to say that something on the order of a third probably were veterans.

23:42.154 --> 23:45.060
Because now you were older than a bunch of the seniors.

23:45.462 --> 23:46.804
That's right, that's right.

23:46.964 --> 23:48.846
And who all was out at the airbase?

23:48.886 --> 23:49.687
Just the freshmen?

23:49.727 --> 23:50.749
Just the freshmen.

23:50.769 --> 24:01.402
All right, who was out there to take control and get y'all into the traditions of A&M and into the Corps and all that?

24:01.542 --> 24:02.824
I don't recall anybody.

24:04.025 --> 24:08.010
Now there was some kind of orientation

24:08.513 --> 24:12.037
classes held in the old theater out there.

24:13.058 --> 24:19.425
But this was everybody, and it was not a compulsory thing.

24:19.445 --> 24:22.268
I mean, you know, they didn't check roles or anything like that.

24:22.288 --> 24:24.290
But how many students were out there?

24:25.972 --> 24:26.452
A thousand?

24:27.854 --> 24:30.777
I don't think there's any more than that.

24:30.877 --> 24:33.660
I'm not sure that all of the freshmen were out there.

24:34.602 --> 24:37.326
Okay, but the only people who were out there were freshmen.

24:37.366 --> 24:37.827
That's right.

24:38.067 --> 24:39.229
Were you all in uniform?

24:41.032 --> 24:41.833
Even you veterans?

24:42.094 --> 24:43.596
No, no.

24:43.616 --> 24:44.938
What did you wear to class?

24:45.319 --> 24:53.852
Well, mostly, I mostly wore uniform, but it was one that was left over from my Army career.

24:54.533 --> 25:00.222
Now, I guess,

25:01.450 --> 25:09.641
All new entering students were in the Corps, but the veteran had the choice.

25:11.083 --> 25:26.665
When I went in, I was told, you know, that I could go into ROTC or else, but they gave me credit for all the ROTC hours from having commissioned.

25:28.788 --> 25:32.132
So did you, did you join the Corps that freshman year?

25:32.272 --> 25:32.492
No.

25:32.692 --> 25:32.993
Okay.

25:33.553 --> 25:34.394
No, I never.

25:34.414 --> 25:38.399
So you didn't have to fall into March to class or anything?

25:38.439 --> 25:38.659
No.

25:38.979 --> 25:41.102
How did you register for your classes?

25:44.445 --> 25:50.712
I registered before I came to A&M, and then I was just given the schedule.

25:50.732 --> 25:51.113
Okay.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.696
Building number and the time, and I went to classes.

25:55.277 --> 25:57.900
Describe those, those classes, please.

25:58.927 --> 26:01.710
Well, most of them, of course, were big, big classes.

26:01.730 --> 26:12.160
I mean, there was anywhere from, you know, 200 or so in the classes, and they were just the typical basic freshman courses.

26:14.423 --> 26:15.764
Do you remember some of the teachers?

26:21.510 --> 26:23.592
No, I sure don't.

26:23.612 --> 26:26.655
Like, I know Harrison Hearth in English was out there.

26:27.884 --> 26:34.855
And wasn't Tom Harrington in charge or was it somebody else?

26:39.942 --> 26:43.628
Harrington was, yeah, I think, I believe he was in charge of that.

26:46.492 --> 26:53.503
I don't, I should remember an English teacher, but I don't.

26:54.378 --> 26:54.899
Pierce.

26:55.901 --> 26:56.643
Oh, yeah.

26:57.885 --> 26:58.567
Yeah, yeah.

26:58.787 --> 27:02.134
I remember he was an English teacher.

27:02.154 --> 27:08.067
And I think some of the other teachers, like in math and

27:08.873 --> 27:10.515
in chemistry and things like that.

27:10.555 --> 27:13.317
I believe there may have been a lot of graduate students out there.

27:13.357 --> 27:15.019
I know there was in the laboratory.

27:15.700 --> 27:20.504
Now, and you were at that point going to major in what?

27:20.524 --> 27:21.285
Civil engineering.

27:21.305 --> 27:22.826
Civil engineering.

27:22.846 --> 27:23.988
That was your choice?

27:24.008 --> 27:27.751
When I enrolled, I came up here to get a degree in civil engineering.

27:27.771 --> 27:34.458
I never considered anything else, and that's what I worked for.

27:34.698 --> 27:36.940
How determined were you to do the work well?

27:39.940 --> 28:02.312
Well, I don't know how to, I don't know how to answer that, but not, not only me, but I think many of the people of my time, failure wasn't an option.

28:02.633 --> 28:04.936
That's right.

28:04.956 --> 28:08.061
You set out to do something, and you did it.

28:08.161 --> 28:09.643
You didn't, you, you,

28:10.501 --> 28:13.846
You didn't have a plan B in case you didn't make it.

28:14.286 --> 28:16.650
And how many years was it going to take you to get your degree?

28:17.811 --> 28:28.306
Well, I was entitled to, I believe it was 48 months under the GI Bill, and I went 48 months.

28:28.727 --> 28:29.749
And you were going to finish?

28:31.291 --> 28:37.099
I had, as I recall, 160 some odd hours

28:37.366 --> 28:42.010
I had more hours than I needed.

28:42.791 --> 28:52.219
I went every semester and every summer, and I worked besides that.

28:52.299 --> 29:01.248
Now, after my sophomore year, we moved over to the College View.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.188
College View.

29:02.348 --> 29:04.130
But let's stick with that first year.

29:04.691 --> 29:07.373
Describe a typical day

29:07.657 --> 29:16.349
for you and your wife, what time did you get up, because she had to come over to the campus, and what did you do all, what was the day like?

29:16.429 --> 29:17.630
Describe the whole day.

29:18.712 --> 29:19.753
Got up by what time?

29:20.754 --> 29:22.897
Oh, probably 6.30 in the morning.

29:24.279 --> 29:25.461
Of course, we ate breakfast.

29:26.602 --> 29:37.056
She faked breakfast with a little bit of help from me, and she went in to campus, and it was

29:37.677 --> 29:45.054
She and one or two other ladies that lived out there rode together and came, she came into the campus.

29:45.855 --> 29:53.172
I went to my first class and then they, they'd taken

29:53.725 --> 30:22.855
one of the old buildings out there and made it into a recreational hall sort of and there was a PX out there that where you could get a sandwich and coffee and things like that and there was there was three or four of us that were all veterans that became acquainted with one another and we when we any of us any two of us had

30:23.138 --> 30:49.551
free time where we'd probably meet over and drink coffee sometimes we'd play checkers and dominoes or something of that sort there wasn't any and then where'd you eat lunch oh I usually eat a sandwich or something there maybe at the PX or I'd go go back over to the apartment and make me a sandwich or something and where did you study they had a

30:51.893 --> 31:13.615
in in the rec hall out there which had been the what had it been in the military I don't know it'd been a recreation room in the military there was places there it was big enough to where there was and it was divided up such that you could go over there and study and

31:14.050 --> 31:18.935
And then I'd just go back home and study there in the apartment there.

31:18.955 --> 31:22.198
And how did you, your first semester, how did the grades come out?

31:27.624 --> 31:28.424
I don't remember.

31:28.525 --> 31:34.531
I passed everything, but I don't, I wasn't an honor student and never was.

31:35.972 --> 31:38.094
Was it easy or hard or?

31:38.114 --> 31:42.859
It was very hard for me to get back into the routine of study.

31:43.953 --> 31:51.295
Of course, I'd come out of a little bitty high school, and the math particularly was hard.

31:51.796 --> 31:58.536
Math, although I chose a career that's got lots of math.
