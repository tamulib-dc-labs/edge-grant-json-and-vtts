WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:11.846
There was, I would say a girl, only she was a little 
older than a girl, but somebody that I had taught

00:03.558 --> 00:11.846
that one year. She came back to Brady and lived with 
a lady that lived just behind me. And she came over

00:19.192 --> 00:20.494
one day. It must have been early August of 45. And 
I'd been hearing from Earl from Le Havre, which was

00:26.279 --> 00:31.624
a place where they shipped them home from. And she 
said, you've just got to go with me. See, she

00:35.023 --> 00:38.891
married a New Yorker, and she had the car. And he was 
back, and he wanted her to get on up there. And so.

00:50.403 --> 00:53.607
I remember calling my parents and seeing if they 
would keep the two children. They said, yeah. So

00:54.809 --> 00:55.810
they came and got them. We left the next day and 
drove nonstop to New York City. And by then, she

01:00.856 --> 01:04.741
said that she hadn't been able to get anybody to 
ride with her. But by the time we left, there was a

01:05.242 --> 01:08.586
young man who was in the Navy. But we all knew him 
from high school. He early coached him. And a young

01:12.138 --> 01:16.162
woman that we didn't know, but her husband was in 
the Navy up there somewhere. So there were four of

01:16.783 --> 01:17.764
us. And we saved the one young man for the night 
driving. And then we'd take turns sitting next to

01:23.991 --> 01:27.175
him so we'd keep him awake. And the other young 
woman didn't know how to drive. So the owner of the

01:31.980 --> 01:34.803
car and I did the daytime driving. And the only 
thing I can remember about that, I don't know how

01:35.404 --> 01:40.069
much gasoline was, a gallon. But we each put $10 in 
the pot, the ones that didn't own the car, to buy

01:40.235 --> 01:47.925
gas. And agreed that if that ran out, we'd put some 
more in. But it never ran out. We got all the way to

01:53.071 --> 01:56.215
New York City on $30 worth of gas. And we were to meet 
her husband in Grand Central Station, my friend

01:57.977 --> 02:07.930
Alice, who had insisted that I stay with her.

02:09.513 --> 02:10.955
So she was down there to meet us. It's amazing how we 
even knew how to find that place. Right now, when

02:16.203 --> 02:18.406
did he get there? Okay, nine days later. And during 
that time, the 6th of August, they dropped the

02:21.931 --> 02:25.737
atomic bomb. I thought, hmm, they dropped the 
bomb. Didn't mean anything to me. I was waiting for

02:28.380 --> 02:31.685
my husband to come home. No, I didn't take much 
notice of that at all. But it's funny how I got in

02:34.850 --> 02:38.355
touch with somebody that could... tell me what to 
do and what not to do. In Menard, there was a man that

02:41.459 --> 02:45.523
owned the theater there. And his name was Henry 
Reeves. He was not like anybody else in Menard.

02:52.269 --> 02:56.412
Well, he's got a really good story behind him, but I 
won't try to tell you that. But he had some

02:57.093 --> 02:58.835
relative. I'm not sure whether it was a son or 
something else. But he was already back home from

03:02.618 --> 03:05.100
the war. And he'd been with the same division that 
Earl was with. And it was back in Philadelphia. And

03:12.004 --> 03:15.471
so Henry gave me his number to call him in 
Philadelphia. He said, he can tell you what to do.

03:18.696 --> 03:21.782
So when I got to New York, I called him and got him. 
And he put me in touch with a Colonel Jones at the

03:22.804 --> 03:26.350
port of embarkation. And that man had also been 
with the 28th Division. So he was so helpful to me.

03:33.816 --> 03:37.861
And he said, I know that you would like to go down and 
see him get off the boat. He told me what boat he was

03:38.482 --> 03:41.465
coming in on, something I'd never heard of. And he 
said, you just stay where you are, and I will let him

03:42.566 --> 03:48.713
know your number. Well, not only did he let him know 
the number to reach me, he sent it to Earl 30 miles at

03:49.193 --> 03:55.120
sea. So he knew where to get in touch. And of course, 
he had no earthly idea I was even going to be in New

03:57.831 --> 04:00.975
York. And I didn't either. At first, we had thought 
about it. But then we decided that travel was so

04:05.581 --> 04:10.248
difficult that we better not try that. I'd meet him 
somewhere else. But it worked out. So that's what

04:14.634 --> 04:20.021
gave me my first taste of New York. And I decided I 
didn't like New York. Alice got us a reservation at

04:24.057 --> 04:27.080
the Pierre Hotel. It's still a very fancy hotel 
where all the presidents and so on stay. And I was so

04:33.506 --> 04:36.849
country, I didn't know anything. And I had my 
little suitcase, and I was out on the corner

04:37.530 --> 04:42.675
waiting for a cab. And men in New York would just 
elbow you out of the way if a cab came along. I

04:47.699 --> 04:48.881
thought, I don't like this. But anyway, I finally 
got down there.

04:54.955 --> 04:57.098
It was a lovely hotel. Describe the scene when he 
got off the boat and you first saw him. I didn't see

05:04.829 --> 05:05.430
him. He told me to stay in her apartment and he would 
give Earl the word of where to call me. He also said,

05:13.321 --> 05:18.288
don't expect to see him for 24 hours because they 
have this debriefing or whatever. So I was

05:19.770 --> 05:23.916
prepared not to see him, but I went on down and got in 
the room at the hotel. And four o'clock, he landed

05:24.655 --> 05:29.361
about nine in the morning, and four o'clock he was 
at the door. That's pretty exciting. Hadn't seen

05:32.204 --> 05:33.185
him in two years. Hadn't seen him in two years. And 
Alice, when she was out visiting with me, she was

05:35.488 --> 05:43.197
always taking movies of the kids and whatever was 
going on out there. So she had a party at her

05:43.838 --> 05:47.743
apartment and showed all those. So Earl got to kind 
of catch up on what the kids were looking like, you

05:47.763 --> 05:51.327
know. Right. How did he appear? That first view 
after the war was over compared with your memory of

05:55.857 --> 06:01.465
him before he left? He was pretty trim. He still 
weighed about 218, and yet he was just as trim

06:03.447 --> 06:10.216
because, oh, the training they had, you know. Now, 
did you, as he walked or did anything, did you

06:11.438 --> 06:17.426
detect any of the effects of the injuries? No, not 
at all. And then he had a 30-day leave, and the plan

06:20.596 --> 06:30.273
was that the division was to reassemble at Camp 
Shelby, Mississippi. I thought I wouldn't

06:31.175 --> 06:32.777
remember that one, but I did. It's out of 
Hattiesburg. And be sent to the Pacific Theater.

06:39.249 --> 06:40.030
That was the plan. But during the 30-day leave that 
he was at home... war with japan ended see after

06:43.934 --> 07:10.279
dropping those atomic bombs a couple of them they 
gave it gave it up and so he thought that he'd just go

06:43.934 --> 07:10.279
over there and they'd say go home you know didn't 
work that way so he called me again won't you over

06:43.934 --> 07:10.279
here by let's see call me sunday morning i want you 
over here by tuesday noon because tuesday evening

06:43.934 --> 07:10.279
they have the final dinner so i had to I was a 
creature of habit. I didn't usually wash with my

07:14.417 --> 07:19.902
little ringer-type washing machine, which I had 
to pull over next to the sink. I didn't wash until

07:21.243 --> 07:23.245
Monday. But that day I did. I washed on Sunday. And I 
just took it from the ringer in a pan over to the lady

07:27.028 --> 07:35.956
that ironed for me, left that afternoon, because 
he wanted me there by Tuesday noon. And I made it.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.481
But we spent one night on the road I've forgotten 
where. But he was, like I said, he was in the habit of

07:42.912 --> 07:46.857
giving orders, and he had given to me. He wanted me 
somewhere at a certain time. All right. Then when

07:49.801 --> 07:54.647
is he discharged, or released, maybe you should 
say? Well, that, I said, you know, right now, I'm

07:54.667 --> 08:01.395
writing to somebody about something. See, for 
Earl's 35 years in the reserve, I get absolutely

08:01.976 --> 08:08.384
nothing. And I shouldn't put that on this tape, but 
I don't care. And any time the Army wanted

08:13.473 --> 08:18.080
anything, there wasn't any question in Earl's 
mind, he did it. And while I was still over there at

08:19.382 --> 08:24.270
Camp Shelby, that's where I went for the final 
dinner. And

08:25.993 --> 08:33.965
I had looked around for a place to live because I 
thought we might just be staying there for a while.

08:34.907 --> 08:41.337
And when I finally found something I thought might 
work, he got orders from wherever. They wanted him

08:42.717 --> 08:47.825
to be in command of a victory loan train, it was 
called. Did you ever hear of that? And it had all

08:50.269 --> 08:59.404
kinds of war souvenirs, and they'd send it around 
the whole United States, selling war bonds to help

08:50.269 --> 08:59.404
pay for the war. So he didn't, that, let's see, that 
must have been in September. And he didn't get home

09:07.962 --> 09:10.405
until two days before Christmas. And it really 
made me mad because he'd been gone two years and he

09:11.207 --> 09:15.252
got home. And I'd had to, you know, take care of the 
kids and all, everything for that length of time.

09:23.184 --> 09:25.887
Then darned if they didn't snatch him up again. But 
he never questioned anything like that. All

09:29.893 --> 09:30.474
right. So then he is released from active duty 
about the beginning of 1946. Yeah. And so where did

09:37.392 --> 09:38.613
you go? In April of 1946, he was elected mayor of 
Brady.

09:47.584 --> 09:50.047
I've been having some calls that there's nobody 
there. I've been hoping I'd hear from Anne. See,

09:53.972 --> 09:56.135
she's been gone a week today. She's in France. Oh, 
that's right. She told me she was going. And my

09:59.739 --> 10:01.061
granddaughter, I sent her. 17 years old. She's a 
cutie. Y'all moved then to Brady, and where did you

10:04.966 --> 10:09.174
live? No, we were still in Brady. I was already 
there. Yeah. But we bought another house. Oh, you

10:12.601 --> 10:14.064
bought a house. Uh-huh. All right, and he comes 
back and starts to do what? In Brady, well, he had a

10:18.653 --> 10:22.080
member of the Rangers that he was determined that 
he wanted to go into business with Earl. So as I say,

10:26.645 --> 10:31.069
Earl had this drug store, a half interest in it. And 
Frank Carter was this fellow's name. And he was an

10:35.112 --> 10:37.454
Aggie, finished in 40. And Frank had been wounded 
severely in the war on D-Day. When Frank came to see

10:43.820 --> 10:52.607
me, Frank and Elizabeth and their little girl, who 
was nine days younger than, older than Ann,

10:55.540 --> 10:58.183
it suddenly made me realize what a war could do. 
Because Frank had just graduated from A&M, you

10:58.524 --> 11:01.928
know, and looked good. And when he came to see me, he 
had a temporary eye. He'd lost one eye, lost all of

11:07.636 --> 11:10.079
his teeth. On D-Day, it's a wonder he even 
survived. And they put in a Goodyear and GE store.

11:19.592 --> 11:24.298
And then they bought a service station just so they 
could have a place to mount the tire. And my parents

11:24.380 --> 11:26.924
had given us our part of the ranch. And with the 
ranch and two business, look after that was about

11:28.166 --> 11:33.254
all he wanted to do. All right, so, and at that 
point, you were a stay-at-home mother. Oh, yes,

11:36.759 --> 11:39.243
and adding to the family. That's what I was going to 
say. Right along. All right, and then so he plunges

11:41.747 --> 11:47.475
into the life of the town and soon is elected mayor 
of Brady. He had only been home since two days

11:48.357 --> 11:51.962
before Christmas and got elected in April. My, my. 
All right, then... His opponent was a longtime

11:53.084 --> 11:57.750
mayor, I might add. Uh-oh, uh-oh. Now, and 
everybody would agree that Brady is in the hill

12:01.535 --> 12:06.282
country, wouldn't they? Well, yeah, at least our 
ranch is. I didn't know that growing up, but

12:10.207 --> 12:17.557
somebody gave me a little pamphlet called Guide to 
the Texas Hill Country, and it defines exactly

12:10.207 --> 12:17.557
where it is. And I got a map and drew it out, and I 
thought, well, So both of you were then from the

12:20.776 --> 12:25.560
hill country? I guess so. Okay. Now, in 1948, I 
understand that Mr. Rutter got involved in the

12:26.962 --> 12:34.309
U.S. Senate campaign. Yes, he did. Very 
thoroughly. Please describe that as you remember

12:38.112 --> 12:40.594
it. Well, Lyndon Johnson, as everybody knows, was 
quite a distinct character. And I remember him

12:46.560 --> 12:50.023
coming to the House, and he said, Earl, now... 
Johnson's opponent in that race was Coke

12:51.775 --> 12:59.065
Stevenson, who was a rancher on the other side of 
Junction, and my parents were strong for him. They

12:59.125 --> 13:03.751
could hardly stand the idea of Earl taking over 
Johnson's campaign. He wanted Earl to be his

13:03.791 --> 13:07.977
campaign manager in our district, which had about 
16 or 18 counties. And he said, now, Earl, you won't

13:08.959 --> 13:17.030
be able to carry McCulloch County, that's where 
Brady is, because you're too close to my opponent.

13:17.050 --> 13:18.812
But just do the best you can with it. And as you know, 
he won the statewide election by 87 votes, and they

13:19.872 --> 13:25.498
dubbed him Landslide Linden. But when they 
counted the votes in McCulloch County, that

13:26.499 --> 13:34.368
county went for him by more votes than he won the 
statewide election. Oh, really? Oh. And so from

13:35.349 --> 13:38.232
then on, Earl was his fair-haired boy. And he had us 
down, they did, for a lunch at their apartment in

13:39.113 --> 13:43.298
Austin. for a football game, and we got the 
experience of a wild ride across Austin with

13:44.172 --> 13:53.162
Lyndon Johnson at the wheel in a convertible. And, 
oh, they just were very nice to us, and always were.

13:59.549 --> 14:05.095
And after he became president, then, you know, it 
was a very opportune time. If Earl needed help in

14:05.515 --> 14:11.402
Washington with Lyndon Johnson and Tiger Teague, 
he could pretty well get it. And Jake Pickle. And

14:12.343 --> 14:13.504
Jake Pickle, yeah. During that campaign, what did 
Mr. Rudder, what did he do? Did he write letters,

14:21.208 --> 14:22.970
make speeches? Yeah, and he had campaign workers 
in every county. And I'll never forget, we had a

14:28.616 --> 14:33.462
dinner at Brady Country Club. It doesn't even have 
food service. So we had to get the food brought in.

14:38.328 --> 14:39.609
And there were two women out there. I was one of 
them, and then Dorothy Green from Eden, Earl's

14:40.029 --> 14:44.014
good friend's wife. And we were over there to 
handle the kitchen. And just ask the men, not their

14:47.424 --> 14:50.848
wives. And we had about 250 acceptances and had 
over 300 that came. And I could tell we were running

14:55.852 --> 14:57.314
out of food. So we had to send in to get food. Anyway, 
he was there, of course.

15:09.446 --> 15:13.950
But then after that, gosh, back in 66, when they 
were in the White House, they invited us up for a

15:15.331 --> 15:21.438
dinner for Henry Cabot Lodge. And that was pretty 
exciting for me. I'd never been in the White House

15:23.921 --> 15:32.332
at all, Earl had, because Lyndon Johnson had sent 
him on a fact-finding tour. And I don't know what

15:34.234 --> 15:36.437
year that was, but it was before 66. And just a small 
group of them, but Earl was to check on the

15:38.219 --> 15:43.465
educational opportunities in Vietnam. And I do 
know the only female on the trip was Ovita Cup

15:45.959 --> 15:50.523
Hobby. I've forgotten what she, but anyway,

15:50.704 --> 15:59.392
we went up for that, for the dinner for Henry Cabot 
Lodge. It was very nice. I was very impressed,

16:01.574 --> 16:05.198
because I saw so many important people that I never 
thought I'd see. But you know, A&M had had, Tiger

16:06.179 --> 16:14.987
had helped so much with getting speakers for 
SCONA, the Student Conference on National

16:06.179 --> 16:14.987
Affairs. I knew a lot of those because they came to 
this party. Sure, sure. What was your impression

16:19.666 --> 16:26.436
of, I presume before 1948, you did not know Mrs. 
Johnson, Lady Byrne? Well, I knew her sometime.

16:29.560 --> 16:30.581
I've got pictures with her. What was your 
impression of her? She was always very nice. Very

16:35.926 --> 16:37.528
friendly, very nice. I think she's top-notch. Oh, 
yeah, she is. And she's got to be patient to put up

16:40.433 --> 16:43.337
with that. Super lady. And, you know, I didn't know 
until I guess I got the battalion. Lucy spoke at...

16:49.767 --> 16:52.772
Commencement. Yeah, the medical school 
commencement. I was surprised. Saturday

16:56.097 --> 16:57.159
morning. Yes. It quoted her some, you know, what 
she'd said. But I don't know. She's going by the

17:01.864 --> 17:08.630
name of Lucy Baines Johnson again, so I don't know 
whether her second marriage is out or not. I don't

17:08.750 --> 17:09.170
know. I don't know either. Okay, so 1948, and then 
so win that campaign, and y'all are still in Brady.

17:21.021 --> 17:21.801
Yep. And he's ranching and running the 
businesses. Two businesses, yeah. And you're

17:26.467 --> 17:28.952
adding to the number of children. Yeah. And then 
Alan Shivers. Is it Alan Shivers that brings him to

17:33.361 --> 17:35.606
Austin? Well, yeah. But before that, one of the 
things Earl did as mayor, you know, Brady during

17:36.167 --> 17:45.907
the war had an airfield training pilots. And After 
the war was over, they deactivated it. And Earl, I

17:50.994 --> 17:55.679
have a feeling that probably Lyndon Johnson let 
him know, I don't know that. See, Earl kept a lot of

17:56.500 --> 17:58.762
things to himself. I didn't know. But he found out 
somehow from Washington that they were going to

18:00.384 --> 18:06.049
deactivate that field. And you know, the Air Force 
built things pretty darn nice. And so Earl goes to

18:10.354 --> 18:12.716
Washington. And there's two hangars. There's 
runways. There's shops. There's barracks.

18:19.758 --> 18:20.279
Everything. Earl gets the whole thing for $23,000 
for Brady. Oh, my goodness. And

18:26.308 --> 18:43.614
anyway, it

18:26.308 --> 18:43.614
was going along fine until the labor organizers 
came down from Dallas and organized labor union,

18:26.308 --> 18:43.614
and then they started having strikes. And every 
time they had a strike, they'd call Earl to mediate

18:44.635 --> 18:49.022
it because he knew everybody that worked out 
there. And finally they just said, you just got to

18:50.285 --> 18:57.536
go to work out there to run the thing. Well, I 
remember him telling me, he said, I know what I'll

18:59.739 --> 19:02.904
do. He said, I'll just put my salary so high they 
won't hire me. Because he didn't really want to. He

19:07.971 --> 19:09.774
put his salary at $12,000 a year. And they hired 
him. That's what he was doing when he was appointed

19:12.378 --> 19:15.443
land commissioner. All right. and they were 
manufacturing wings the Martin bombers and they

19:17.234 --> 19:42.955
they employed over 800 out there and of course we 
were in the midst of this seven-year drought and

19:17.234 --> 19:42.955
these little these ranchers were employed at this 
plant kept them from going broke so it was a real

19:17.234 --> 19:42.955
good thing and during all this time you all 
maintained the ranch yeah your ranch Where did he

19:44.082 --> 19:48.049
and Alan Shivers first have a connection? Well, 
Earl came home from that war, and he said, War is

19:48.830 --> 19:55.882
such a terrible thing. If you don't want it to 
happen again, you better get to work on the home

19:55.962 --> 20:00.310
front to keep it from happening. So he just 
launched into everything. Among things he did, he

20:04.417 --> 20:08.963
got elected to the State Democratic Executive 
Committee. If you remember, Haskell, there

20:09.483 --> 20:11.426
weren't any Republicans. Right. Just a little 
handful, maybe in Dallas. And they didn't matter.

20:14.830 --> 20:15.030
No. And anyway, the Democratic Party was just the 
same as two parties, the liberal faction and the

20:15.771 --> 20:22.399
conservative faction. Well, Shivers and Earl, 
too, were conservative. And so that's how the

20:26.444 --> 20:32.331
governor got to know Earl, was through that State 
Democratic Executive Committee. and then he was

20:33.340 --> 20:57.103
elected the state board of public welfare and I 
don't know what all but he sure didn't want another

20:33.340 --> 20:57.103
war and so then when things fell apart

20:33.340 --> 20:57.103
you know the land office story you know that don't 
you now Are you aware of who suggested or how Mr.

21:02.395 --> 21:06.058
Rudder's name came to Alan Shivers to do that task? 
I think Shivers just did it himself. That's what I

21:08.201 --> 21:09.983
think. See, here's the one that he succeeded. 
There you go. Yeah, Bascom Giles. Yeah. All right.

21:15.088 --> 21:19.253
How did y'all, how did Shivers communicate? 
That's his grandson. He's a doctor here. Well

21:23.297 --> 21:24.018
respected. You know him. Yes, yes. Yeah, that's 
his grandson. How did Governor Shivers

21:28.319 --> 21:32.145
communicate? Oh, it shocked Earl to death. Was it a 
phone call? No. There's a lawyer there in Brady,

21:38.454 --> 21:41.980
Ben Davis Gieselin. I don't know if he's still a 
lawyer or not, but he was at UT when I was. Anyway, he

21:46.667 --> 21:55.520
had to go to Austin for something, seeing somebody 
in the Capitol, and so he wanted Earl to just drive

21:46.667 --> 21:55.520
with him there. I said, okay, said I'll. drive with 
you I'll go talk to the governor and Earl had

21:57.108 --> 22:20.652
somebody in mind and I don't know who it was that he 
thought would be nice to appoint as land

21:57.108 --> 22:20.652
commissioner and so when he got there at the 
capitol he went to the governor's office and Alan

21:57.108 --> 22:20.652
Shivers was there and so when Earl said well he had 
an idea who somebody he might want to consider he

21:57.108 --> 22:20.652
said we've already decided. And Earl said, well, 
who? He said, you. Oh, Earl, and he fainted. And so

22:27.206 --> 22:32.673
Earl, he gave Earl until 10 o'clock the next 
morning to make up his mind. Well, it had, the news

22:34.456 --> 22:40.804
had come out over radio because we didn't, still 
didn't have TV. And we got home, no.

22:46.813 --> 22:47.794
That must be the next day. It was. Anyway, he said he 
had to make up his mind by 10 o'clock the next day.

22:55.632 --> 23:00.265
Well, I had, of course, by then, five children. Bob 
was just a baby. He knew he was premature and all

23:01.228 --> 23:03.274
this stuff. And... I just knew there was something 
bad wrong with my health. And my doctor, who was

23:09.270 --> 23:15.560
also our good friend, said, he called me by my silly 
nickname, so I'm not going to divulge that. He

23:16.381 --> 23:19.106
said, nothing wrong with you, but five kids and no 
help. He said, but if you'll feel better, I will

23:19.947 --> 23:23.794
send you through the clinic in Fort Worth. And that 
was the day that I was to go through the clinic. So we

23:27.259 --> 23:28.521
get up early. And so on the way to Fort Worth for me to 
go through the clinic, Earl and I talked this over,

23:33.852 --> 23:41.047
and I said, Earl, you just do what you want to do, 
because I said, my work's cut out for me with these

23:33.852 --> 23:41.047
five children. And Earl had very decided ideas 
about how to run a family. He ran his job and

23:47.239 --> 23:49.083
business. I ran the house and the children. 
Anyway, but if anything important, of course, he

23:51.554 --> 23:55.358
made the decision. So we got back, of course, after 
going through the clinic and then driving home. It

24:02.467 --> 24:15.162
was late, and they had already come out with the 
fact on the evening news that Earl was the new land

24:02.467 --> 24:15.162
commissioner because Earl went in the telephone 
booth there at the clinic and called Shivers and

24:02.467 --> 24:15.162
said he'd take it. So then we got home, and the house 
was full of people. And, you know, Brady's a little

24:19.313 --> 24:20.755
town. Everybody knew us and all. So we didn't get 
everybody shooed out until midnight. Next

24:27.462 --> 24:31.246
morning, we got up at 5.30, and it was pouring rain, 
which was rare. And the doorbell rang, and I was

24:32.267 --> 24:35.310
still in my robe. And I answered the door, and I told 
them, come on in. It was an Angelo paper. They had a

24:41.216 --> 24:43.819
reporter and a photographer, and they came in. I 
told them, just make themselves at home. I had to go

24:46.462 --> 24:47.903
get ready. But we made it. Now, that's what year? 
55. 55. And you moved then to Austin. You know, he

24:57.885 --> 24:59.988
took office in January. I said, he

25:00.529 --> 25:07.720
took office, and he left me with a pickup. We had a 
car and a pickup for the ranks. He left me with a

25:09.963 --> 25:11.446
pickup and five children. But... He didn't have 
time to concentrate on finding a place for us to

25:14.444 --> 25:18.468
live. So we didn't get a house until, to move into 
until a week before school started. And so you and

25:27.718 --> 25:29.440
the children then moved over there? Yeah. And he 
served for how long? Well he's, see it was just a

25:35.426 --> 25:39.270
two-year term at that time. And so in one year, I 
remember the first thing he told me, he said, you

25:39.622 --> 25:47.660
know, I don't know who in that office is in cahoots 
with the commissioner. So I've got to get somebody

25:48.442 --> 25:50.627
around me I know I can trust. So there was a 
classmate of his that lived on a farm between Brady

25:56.142 --> 26:14.826
and Rochelle and his wife taught school in 
Rochelle and they had three kids just scratching

25:56.142 --> 26:14.826
out a living so he picked this fella up and he did 
real well and took him and but that's what he said he

25:56.142 --> 26:14.826
had to have somebody around him he knew he could 
trust So it was an Aggie classmate of him. Okay, so,

26:18.866 --> 26:25.935
all right, he is appointed in 55, then he's elected 
to a full term in 56. Yeah. A full two-year term.

26:27.817 --> 26:28.718
Yeah. He had a two-year term to serve, but you had to 
run before your term was up, you know. And so,

26:36.227 --> 26:38.350
actually, that was... crazy summer he knew that I 
couldn't leave the house and go help with a

26:38.583 --> 27:04.017
campaign anywhere so we had this big old two-story 
house with a full basement below that had outside

26:38.583 --> 27:04.017
entrance so he decided we'd have campaign 
headquarters in our house and my job was to serve

26:38.583 --> 27:04.017
refreshments every night oh boy and so he had 
campaigned all over the state and The top fellows

27:05.482 --> 27:07.785
at the land office would come out. They got out the 
campaign material. I didn't have anything to do

27:09.607 --> 27:10.709
with that. But we thought we'd be lucky to have a 
dozen volunteers a night. We had 68 or more than

27:18.819 --> 27:22.043
that. I've forgotten exactly. But anyway,

27:23.325 --> 27:30.814
I was making coffee in two little coffee pots. 
until one of the fellows that was getting out the

27:31.216 --> 27:34.462
campaign material came. He said, is that the way 
you've been serving coffee? I was pouring it up and

27:36.325 --> 27:37.868
everything I had. And I said, yeah. He said, well, 
I'll get one from the church. And so we made coffee

27:41.735 --> 27:45.121
in big bunches in. But anyway, we had two ping pong 
tables end to end with 25 typewriters going around

27:46.202 --> 27:54.677
them in the game room. See, the big part of the 
basement was a big game room and it had a bar and I had

27:56.663 --> 28:08.509
a refrigerator and everything and we had a dumb 
waiter that came down from the kitchen and I could

27:56.663 --> 28:08.509
send food down. Anyway, I have forgotten how long 
that lasted but seemed like a long time to me. And

28:16.998 --> 28:19.200
you all won the election by a good margin. Yeah, 
I've forgotten exactly. It was kind of tight at

28:20.882 --> 28:22.224
first. We had a little cause for concern, but it 
came out okay. And the fellow that he ran against

28:26.748 --> 28:32.054
was a good friend of Price Daniels, was county 
judge over at Tyler.

28:35.077 --> 28:38.501
Mr. Rutter is proceeding to clean up the land 
office. And he did it in one year. Who are the people

28:40.563 --> 28:43.967
that he came to... respect and rely upon most? Who 
were his key? You know one of them. I think, yes.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.401
Clark Diebel. That's what I thought. Yeah, Clark 
was one of those that discovered the land scandal.

28:55.912 --> 29:01.583
He and a newspaper man, I used to know his name, but I 
can't think of it today. I think he was from Quero.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.512
But anyway, Now, y'all didn't know the Diebels 
before you got to Austin. No. Okay, so he... No, but

29:11.717 --> 29:18.407
see, after Clark had been one of the two that 
discovered the scandals, Earl got... He was

29:18.467 --> 29:23.354
working for the state auditor at that time, and 
Earl got him to come over and go to work in the land

29:18.467 --> 29:23.354
office. Clark was a fine, fine person. I agree. 
And... Who else? Well, at the land office? Yeah,

29:31.206 --> 29:32.508
that were key people. Carl Lynn... I've lost 
contact with Carl. L-I-N-D? L-I-N-D. L-I-N-D,

29:38.081 --> 29:38.982
Carl. And Arthur Sherlock, and I know where Arthur 
is, but he's not in very good shape now. He was the

29:44.147 --> 29:45.448
one that was classmate. S-H-A-R-L-A?

29:48.912 --> 29:52.655
S-H-A-R-L-A-C-H, I think, Sherlock. He was class 
of 32, like Earl was. Anyway, oh, there were others

29:56.059 --> 30:02.385
that I knew at the time, but I've kind of forgotten 
them after all these years. Do you remember any

30:03.125 --> 30:13.440
anecdotes about midnight phone calls or anybody 
threatening anything during the land office

30:03.125 --> 30:13.440
days? No. You know, some odd things happened. Such 
as? Like in Brady, there was an attorney there that

30:20.711 --> 30:29.504
had something to do with something, I don't know 
what, but they put a bomb in his car and he almost was

30:20.711 --> 30:29.504
killed. And... But there was one fella in Brady, it 
was so funny that he did his best to get Earl not

30:32.875 --> 31:01.228
elected, not

30:32.875 --> 31:01.228
re-elected because Earl, he had served on the city 
council and Earl discovered that he had been

30:32.875 --> 31:01.228
setting himself up a special utility rate and he 
was one of the biggest utility rate users in the

30:32.875 --> 31:01.228
town of Brady. Anyway, well, I'm just chattering 
now. No, no, no, that's good. And he had Earl's

31:06.228 --> 31:15.340
opponent come out for the... See, G. Raleigh White 
Downs is a racetrack at Brady, and still is.

31:16.221 --> 31:24.633
Anyway,

31:16.221 --> 31:24.633
so this man had Earl's opponent out there and had 
him introduced at the races and everything. So I

31:24.653 --> 31:27.216
had a call from a friend there in Brady, and she 
said... put those five kids in the car and all the

31:27.820 --> 31:33.446
campaign material you can get your hands on and get 
on out here. Said, Wilson has had your husband's

31:34.508 --> 31:39.854
opponent introduced and all. So the next day I did. 
And we put up campaign material between Austin and

31:41.776 --> 31:46.421
Brady. Had a flat on the bridge going across Llano 
River and ruined a tire. And I had to try to find a new

31:50.045 --> 31:55.452
tire on the 4th of July. That was kind of hard. The 
only place we could find it was open to distribute

31:57.790 --> 32:02.766
our campaign material was a beer jar. And we went in 
there, my little kids.
