WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:04.478
I guess we're all right there.

00:07.642 --> 00:10.806
Transcribers might not appreciate it quite so 
much. I have to keep a minute by minute account

00:10.826 --> 00:17.414
because the tape doesn't ring like it's supposed 
to. Tell me how you developed your interest in

00:17.434 --> 00:22.060
oceanography.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.325
My interest in oceanography came about in a rather 
incidental way, I think.

00:29.765 --> 00:34.311
But it's a rather incidental thing.

00:37.475 --> 00:39.117
I was in the Navy in the Second World War. And

00:39.637 --> 00:52.473
I was also in the process of studying for my degree 
in physics at that time, before the Second World

00:39.637 --> 00:52.473
War. And I went back and completed my degree in 
physics after the Second World War and kind of got

00:53.515 --> 00:59.282
into geophysics. and the Earth's magnetic field. 
And in fact, I got into some of the early shielding

01:03.318 --> 01:08.803
problems for nuclear-powered submarines. And 
just one thing and another, I kind of slipped into

01:10.065 --> 01:15.250
the field of oceanography that way. I wanted to 
work around New York, and I found this unique

01:16.951 --> 01:27.902
opportunity to work at the Lamont-Darty 
Geological Observatory outside of New York in

01:16.951 --> 01:27.902
1960. So I'm not one of the oldest people around in 
oceanography. It's only been 17 years now. I was

01:36.556 --> 01:37.777
trained as a physicist. And I was interested in 
geophysics in the sense of large-scale

01:37.877 --> 01:45.225
phenomena. And of course, the oceans do occupy 70% 
of the Earth. And you've got to know what's under

01:49.130 --> 01:51.813
the oceans if you really want to understand the 
Earth. So I kind of got into it that way, I guess. But

01:55.637 --> 01:58.260
that's kind of an oblique way to get into the field. 
Well, it may have been sort of typical in the 50s and

01:58.612 --> 02:01.836
60s in that sense. Where did you do your 
undergraduate work? I went to Louisiana State

02:05.040 --> 02:13.691
University in Baton Rouge and got my, I almost got 
my bachelor's there when I went into the Navy. And

02:13.711 --> 02:17.556
then I came back and finished up my bachelor's and 
got my master's also there. My bachelor's in 1947,

02:18.738 --> 02:22.222
my master's in 1948. And then went to New York 
University and got a degree in physics. Have you

02:28.328 --> 02:30.652
all along been inclined towards physics? That 
it's something you've developed as an

02:31.212 --> 02:33.636
undergraduate at LSU, or just? Yeah. No, ever 
since, I can trace the origin of my interest in

02:34.497 --> 02:42.610
physics very carefully as well from my high school 
days. My first course in physics, ever since then,

02:43.090 --> 02:48.479
I was sold on physics. And in fact, I've kind of 
specialized in the Earth's magnetic field and

02:48.499 --> 02:56.631
geomagnetism. I've had that as kind of a love for a 
long time, too. So these two things kind of pointed

02:59.871 --> 03:08.561
me toward geophysics and pointed me toward the 
oceans, I guess. Well, the reason I was asking is

03:08.581 --> 03:16.329
physics becomes sort of the infield in 
oceanography beginning, oh, 56, 57, 58. You see

03:16.590 --> 03:19.793
more of your people drawn towards physics, but you 
precede that. Was there anybody at NYU whom? you

03:23.003 --> 03:28.108
should say, had particular influence on you 
towards physics and oceanography? No, it wasn't.

03:30.691 --> 03:32.593
My career has been rather checkered. At NYU, I was 
studying cosmic rays and things related to cosmic

03:32.613 --> 03:43.164
rays and got interested in the large-scale 
phenomena. I suppose that's kind of a geophysics.

03:45.426 --> 03:49.150
It's not oriented toward the marine side, but it's 
geophysics as well. And from there, I... You know,

03:53.446 --> 03:57.972
when you get your degree in physics, you're really 
rather well equipped to do any number of things. I

03:58.613 --> 04:09.769
went into teaching overseas and traveling a bit 
and then worked with General Dynamics

03:58.613 --> 04:09.769
Corporation for a few years and got into this 
propulsion, nuclear propulsion thing with them.

04:09.789 --> 04:19.603
Nuclear propulsion was just becoming feasible in 
those days and got into the propulsion of

04:09.789 --> 04:19.603
submarines and from there got into marine work. 
Okay. Now, when you begin to move into submarines,

04:19.990 --> 04:22.632
where do you go to work? You don't stay with General 
Dynamics? No. The thing I got into with submarines

04:26.476 --> 04:32.201
was how you find them in the oceans, which was a very 
important thing. And one of the ways you find them

04:32.901 --> 04:36.344
is by measuring small magnetic effects. And so I 
got started studying the background magnetic

04:37.205 --> 04:49.035
effects in the ocean, whether the spatially 
varying and the time varying magnetic anomalies

04:37.205 --> 04:49.035
you have in the ocean. and found out that those, in 
fact, could tell you a great deal about the Earth

04:49.927 --> 04:56.815
and had never been studied before at all 
adequately. And so when I went to Lamont, I studied

04:56.916 --> 05:02.362
the magnetic anomalies. How long were you at 
Lamont? I was at Lamont from 1960 to 1967, seven

05:04.265 --> 05:08.650
years. And I was on the research staff there. After 
that, I was two years at Hudson Laboratories,

05:14.598 --> 05:20.446
another laboratory of Columbia University, 
which has interesting history. And I came here to

05:21.568 --> 05:24.332
Woods Hole in 1969. OK, this period between 
roughly 1667, while you're involved at Lamont,

05:24.352 --> 05:33.385
what exactly were you doing there? Lamont didn't 
have in those days, and doesn't really now, didn't

05:34.707 --> 05:42.478
have a well-defined departmental structure. But 
they had small groups of people that worked

05:43.866 --> 05:46.108
together. And I suppose my position was in charge 
of the marine magnetic work. And that occupied

05:53.716 --> 05:55.638
about half my time. And we would put magnetometers 
on ships at sea and send them around the world, and

05:56.839 --> 06:03.505
aircraft and other vessels. The other half my time 
was on studying the time variations of the Earth's

06:04.626 --> 06:09.171
magnetic field. And we put instruments in many 
parts the United States and South America as well,

06:12.850 --> 06:17.277
studying time variations. Time variation is 
primarily an ionospheric phenomenon. It's

06:21.344 --> 06:22.867
caused by a change in the ionosphere. So I had the 
best of two possible worlds, the early days of

06:23.668 --> 06:34.065
satellites and new thrust into space, and the very 
interesting days in oceanography. And we were

06:34.085 --> 06:38.132
getting marine geophysical phenomena that had 
some very important meanings. But is it not

06:39.209 --> 06:41.132
correct? Now, I can be corrected, but weren't you 
one of the first people to begin to correlate this

06:41.172 --> 06:45.938
idea of space and ocean?

06:48.842 --> 06:50.143
We were one of the first, yes. There were several, 
two or three places at those days that were into

06:51.105 --> 06:57.573
this business. We had more data than other people. 
We had data from more different parts of the world,

07:01.538 --> 07:07.326
and so our strong point was... we could correlate 
them in many different parts of the world. And it

07:11.927 --> 07:16.172
turned out that was a very significant thing in 
those days. The theory of seafloor spreading is

07:18.595 --> 07:24.242
primarily based upon magnetic anomalies in the 
ocean, as you may know. And so we had a lot of the data

07:24.862 --> 07:30.469
to prove the theory of seafloor spreading. When 
did you first become interested in seafloor

07:31.390 --> 07:34.594
spreading? Well, I don't know. I don't know the 
exact calendar date, but I know the time in the

07:38.069 --> 07:45.257
development of science when it happened. It was 
about 1965, and it was when we first got some data

07:47.700 --> 08:06.642
from the Rike Janus Ridge south of Iceland, the 
middle of the Atlantic south of Iceland, data that

07:47.700 --> 08:06.642
was difficult to interpret in any way except in 
terms of the sea floor spreading theory.

08:07.921 --> 08:14.451
Then we got, quite by chance, we were also getting 
data on the diametrically opposite side of the

08:07.921 --> 08:14.451
Earth in the South Pacific. And it told the same 
story. So when we had these data quite far apart

08:19.419 --> 08:35.464
that could be interpreted in exactly the same way, 
as a matter of fact, the magnetic anomalies in one

08:19.419 --> 08:35.464
place were just like they were in the other, except 
they were stretched out by a factor of about four.

08:36.963 --> 08:38.325
We interpreted it exactly the same way. We were 
convinced, and I think people in many other parts

08:38.825 --> 08:46.215
of the world were convinced that there was a lot to 
the seafloor spreading business. And that was

08:48.297 --> 08:49.319
about 1965. Well, what seemed to be the general 
reaction of the scientific community when this

08:49.980 --> 08:58.370
data begins to come out on seafloor spreading in 
65, 66?

09:01.895 --> 09:05.299
Well, a disbelief, I think, not that they They 
disbelieve the data, but to have such a simple and

09:06.308 --> 09:27.291
revolutionary interpretation of it, and I say 
revolutionary even though it had been suggested

09:06.308 --> 09:27.291
before, but still, it's hard to believe that the 
Earth is behaving in this way. So you've got radio

09:28.552 --> 09:35.860
skepticism, as you still do today in many places, 
and this is very understandable because it's such

09:28.552 --> 09:35.860
a, If you're in the field and realize what it was 
like before, where you're trying to explain

09:37.325 --> 09:52.826
things in quite a different way, and then you come 
along with a simplified, all-encompassing

09:37.325 --> 09:52.826
theory like this, it really is quite profound. 
It's very basic. It means a lot to the people who

09:56.471 --> 09:58.213
were in it. And they were all profoundly impressed 
with it all. And it means a lot to the science, the

10:01.438 --> 10:04.041
way you do your science. Who else was involved in 
seafloor spreading besides yourself? Well,

10:09.425 --> 10:13.551
there were quite a few people involved in 
different aspects of it.

10:17.477 --> 10:28.894
Just on the magnetic side of it, for example, there 
were three institutions that had a great deal of

10:17.477 --> 10:28.894
more data than anybody else and were probably more 
active. There was the Lamont Group, of which I was a

10:30.176 --> 10:32.239
part, There was a Scripps group at Scripps that 
Victor Wauquiez, Raff, Mason were involved in.

10:42.328 --> 10:51.522
There was a group at Cambridge University in 
Britain that Drummond Matthews and Fred Vine and

10:42.328 --> 10:51.522
Teddy Bullard and others were involved in. Those 
were rather the three centers of most of the marine

10:51.722 --> 10:58.412
magnetic activity. Lamont didn't talk to these 
other two as much as they talked to themselves. But

11:04.501 --> 11:08.906
eventually, we all talked to each other and got it 
all straightened out. But Lamont probably had

11:08.966 --> 11:14.292
more data than either of these other two 
institutions. So it was very nice that we could

11:14.312 --> 11:20.298
interpret it in a useful fashion. But there were 
other aspects to sea floor spreading than

11:20.319 --> 11:23.082
magnetics. There were many people involved.

11:29.611 --> 11:34.036
Modern founders of the theory generally thought I 
was being Hess and Dietz. Hess isn't alive today,

11:36.559 --> 11:39.343
but Bob Dietz certainly is. But those are the 
people who promoted the idea probably more. But

11:46.351 --> 11:54.021
the magnetics is the first data that proved it 
convincingly, I think, and kind of turned

11:46.351 --> 11:54.021
everybody's thinking around. And it was 
especially important after this magnetic data

11:55.282 --> 11:58.386
was was interpreted to get into the seismic data, 
where you can make some sense out of all the

11:59.581 --> 12:06.369
earthquake zones around the world. So that fell 
into place next. So not all of the data that was

12:09.653 --> 12:17.062
available in those days supported the theory of 
sea floor spreading, and still doesn't today. But

12:18.063 --> 12:20.526
far and away, the majority of it does. So we had to go 
back and look at some data rather carefully. But

12:25.551 --> 12:29.436
after all, when you're trying to explain almost 
everything geological world with one simple

12:30.260 --> 12:37.991
theory, you're bound to find something that 
doesn't quite mesh. But those were quite exciting

12:38.011 --> 12:39.933
days. And it's always been my feeling that our age 
of discovery is not over yet.

12:54.413 --> 12:54.934
Dirty hand. What do you mean our age of discovery is 
not over yet? I mean that we're only now learning

13:01.256 --> 13:17.519
how to

13:01.256 --> 13:17.519
collect really global data and have the 
computational facilities to see how different

13:01.256 --> 13:17.519
types of data are interrelated. The

13:17.540 --> 13:22.086
motions of the Earth's Axis and other things, the 
earthquakes and whatnot and whatnot, probably,

13:23.939 --> 13:34.450
and changes in the weather, probably all have some 
interrelation. And we don't understand it yet.

13:37.133 --> 13:47.944
But once we do, it'll have a tremendous 
ramification about being able to control our

13:37.133 --> 13:47.944
lives on Earth a lot better and predict what's 
going to happen and where. And these kinds of

13:49.165 --> 13:51.668
things... are very likely to come about in your 
lifetime and mine. Do you think the computer is the

13:56.225 --> 13:58.268
key to this? I think the computer played an 
extremely important element in the theory of sea

13:59.169 --> 14:07.663
floor spreading, because we could handle 
oceanfuls of data at one time. Computers are going

14:10.106 --> 14:13.311
to make a difference in the future as well.

14:16.276 --> 14:17.638
I'm not saying that's going to be We're not going to 
have a technological discovery. It's not going to

14:21.891 --> 14:23.734
be an age of technology so much. There's still lots 
of room for big thinkers. But that is a tool that you

14:28.221 --> 14:32.167
need these days in the computer. It can do so much 
that you couldn't do before. It's quite a

14:35.553 --> 14:39.058
revolution all its own. So we'll see all kinds of 
things, I'm sure, after we probably de-emphasize

14:46.390 --> 14:52.560
the space program a little more and get into 
emphasizing our own earth science programs a bit

14:46.390 --> 14:52.560
more. I think some of these things will shake out of 
the woodwork. Well, it's a thing I was not sure of.

15:00.913 --> 15:06.461
Was it your work with sea floor spreading that led 
to drilling in the ocean floor? Was this where your

15:07.042 --> 15:08.464
interest came from in that? No.

15:15.736 --> 15:24.589
Well, because the institutions I've been 
associated with have always been a member of the

15:15.736 --> 15:24.589
majority's organization, which advises the 
deep-sea drilling project. I've always been

15:24.689 --> 15:29.055
closely associated with the deep-sea drilling 
project. And the last few years, they've had the

15:29.075 --> 15:45.338
capability of drilling rather deep holes into the 
ocean crust, which is something kind of new, and

15:29.075 --> 15:45.338
we've been expecting quite important things to 
come from that, and some of them have. And the

15:46.752 --> 15:53.902
latest thing I've gotten involved in is 
instrumenting the seafloor, putting special

15:46.752 --> 15:53.902
instruments in the seafloor in some of these holes 
that have been drilled. And so we're now getting

15:53.922 --> 16:07.901
heavily involved in that with seismometers and 
other instruments that are useful all over the

15:53.922 --> 16:07.901
world in the seafloor, telling you something 
about what's going on down there. But in a sense,

16:07.921 --> 16:16.152
the deep-sea drilling project is another one of 
these global projects that provides worldwide

16:16.840 --> 16:23.245
data and some very good data. One has to be very 
cautious of interpreting analysis

16:23.265 --> 16:33.434
of certain of these rocks, where the rock is a very 
small thing. And what happens in a particular spot

16:35.196 --> 16:40.800
you drill in the ocean may not be happening 
everywhere in the world. So you don't want to

16:40.820 --> 16:42.202
generalize too quickly. But we're building up 
quite a body of data in the deep sea drilling

16:42.282 --> 16:46.105
project now. quite useful. When did you begin the 
deep sea drilling project? Well, I think it

16:50.240 --> 16:57.048
actually began in its disguised form back about 
1958.

17:00.392 --> 17:05.378
But they weren't using this same ship, the Glomar 
Challenger. So they've completed now about 55

17:05.778 --> 17:09.843
cruises. And they have a 55th cruise now of two 
months each. So that turns out to be quite a few

17:13.187 --> 17:16.311
years. nine years, I guess, that they've been 
drilling around the world. I've been fortunate to

17:21.854 --> 17:25.879
be able to participate in two of these cruises. And 
it's been very nice because it's been a truly

17:25.899 --> 17:31.104
international project. I think one of the first 
ones we've had in the marine area that's truly

17:31.124 --> 17:34.167
international. And working with scientists on 
their own terms is not where they are an incidental

17:34.207 --> 17:47.361
member of a project, but where we are a truly joint 
work as a It's been quite a stimulating thing to do.

17:51.783 --> 18:03.154
After all, I think the real aim of the game is 
intellectual stimulation from all of the science

17:51.783 --> 18:03.154
that we do, and satisfaction from the benefits you 
get out of it to help society, I suppose. How has

18:04.055 --> 18:06.958
international cooperation operated on this 
project? Has it been good? Yes, it has. It's had its

18:10.061 --> 18:14.205
growing pains. The project The Deep Sea Drilling 
Project has been advised by this JOIDES

18:18.053 --> 18:24.524
organization. And the JOIDES is an organization 
of institutions. Well, in non-US places, the

18:29.893 --> 18:35.803
institutions turn out to be government 
laboratories frequently. So we have a mixture of

18:35.823 --> 18:42.154
US private, semi-private labs. and some non-US 
government laboratories. So it's been kind of a

18:46.173 --> 18:50.957
hodgepodge of types of organizations. But each 
one has to justify projects in a slightly

18:52.118 --> 18:55.241
different way. Each one has slightly different 
goals funded on a different basis. And it's been a

18:59.205 --> 19:11.297
real interesting thing from the scientific 
management point of view to see how you can manage

18:59.205 --> 19:11.297
all of these different groups. And each one gets 
his own fair share out of it, puts his own fair share

19:12.155 --> 19:17.404
into it. So that's been, I think, quite good. 
There's been a very minimum of political

19:22.532 --> 19:30.505
involvement, although those things frequently 
are around the corner. But it's worked out quite

19:31.447 --> 19:33.090
well, I think. I hope we have more like it. You think 
the new international boundaries will limit Yes,

19:39.425 --> 19:40.507
very much so. The deep sea drilling project is 
getting into trouble now. Several countries

19:46.296 --> 19:51.164
couldn't see fit to let them drill in their waters 
for one reason or another. And there looks like

19:51.264 --> 19:55.551
there might be some other problems in the future in 
that regard. So the problems are increasingly

19:55.631 --> 19:59.898
frequent now. So we may have to change our way of 
operating somewhat to overcome this. It's true in

20:07.336 --> 20:09.299
oceanography in general, of course. In this 
institution alone, we've had a large fraction of

20:09.359 --> 20:25.242
our plans have been changed because we didn't get 
permission from certain countries to work in

20:09.359 --> 20:25.242
their waters offshore.

20:29.148 --> 20:33.314
I think the DC Drilling Project has been one 
project that's been very good. I've been

20:33.734 --> 20:36.178
fortunate to be involved in some other projects 
fairly large, and I think also made some

20:36.563 --> 20:41.048
contribution too. One of those. Well, we had a 
project that started here in 1972 called Project

20:42.750 --> 20:56.466
Famous out in the joint US and French cooperative 
project where we were diving with submersibles

20:42.750 --> 20:56.466
into the mid-Atlantic Ridge Rift Valley. And we 
made another 50 submersible dives to something

20:57.628 --> 21:04.596
like 9,000 feet then. one summer alone, we've had 
something like 25 or 30 cruises to the area. And we

21:11.340 --> 21:17.909
were mapping the geological structure on a scale 
of a few tens of feet. And that worked out real well.

21:20.653 --> 21:24.919
There was a lot of popularity in the press when it 
came out in 1974. Our big diving program was in

21:25.100 --> 21:26.862
1974. And we've had some very good scientific 
spinoffs from that. And some other programs have

21:30.507 --> 21:34.633
fallen. similar diving programs in other areas. 
This year, we had a big program in the Galapagos

21:37.645 --> 21:41.188
area, the Pacific. It's been very popular.

21:45.793 --> 21:47.495
And found some hot springs and so forth. Been very, 
very good. So that type of program, that's going to

21:49.677 --> 21:55.963
continue for a few years now, sometimes working 
with the French, sometimes working just with the

21:49.677 --> 21:55.963
US. I think that's the first real step by man man as a 
scientist studying the seafloor, working on the

22:02.812 --> 22:07.597
seafloor. And it was a real success, I think. We're 
going to see more of it. We're just learning how to

22:12.161 --> 22:15.704
utilize man on the seafloor now. That's going to be 
a big thing in the next few years, manned

22:15.784 --> 22:20.729
exploration of the seafloor. Hopefully, we could 
get the space agents to become as interested in

22:22.651 --> 22:28.937
that as they have in the exploration of the 
planets.

22:32.343 --> 22:36.328
I heard some adverse comment on subversible work. 
Several people have said they don't think that in

22:36.348 --> 22:40.273
terms of cost, you get your money's worth. What's 
your reaction to that? Well, this was a very common

22:42.776 --> 22:47.862
reaction when this project got started. And so we 
tried to be extremely careful in setting up the

22:48.803 --> 22:54.711
project so that it would be cost effective. And I 
must say, the comments of that nature have almost

23:00.102 --> 23:01.904
disappeared now. There are a few around.

23:06.088 --> 23:11.673
When you look back in hindsight, there are a number 
of things in science that really have produced

23:06.088 --> 23:11.673
nothing. But they had to be done. You had to go 
through that period. The submersible work was in

23:16.257 --> 23:19.820
that category, I think, for a while. I don't think 
it is now. We have so many different tools we bring

23:23.584 --> 23:28.388
to bear before you even have the submersibles go 
down. The people in the submersible almost know

23:28.857 --> 23:32.061
what to expect. The details, they don't know. We 
always say that they should be prepared for small

23:34.324 --> 23:39.069
surprises, but not big ones. If they have a big 
surprise, they haven't done their homework

23:39.910 --> 23:42.313
right. So we come in and map these areas and know the 
gross characteristics of them before they go in,

23:43.214 --> 23:50.023
for safety reasons and for nothing else. So when 
they go down the submersible, they have a very

23:51.184 --> 23:58.493
specific chore that has been, in that particular 
dive mission, has been screened by a group They

23:58.979 --> 24:00.400
know it's a worthwhile mission. Project Famous 
costs the US taxpayers about $4 million over a

24:02.162 --> 24:06.926
period of four years. And there are a few people who 
feel that that was ill-spent. Most people, I

24:14.013 --> 24:15.214
think, now feel it. We've had over 100 scientific 
papers come out. We've had two movies. We've had

24:20.759 --> 24:27.045
books of science fiction and books of fact come out 
on it. I think, rather well received. Very

24:33.584 --> 24:36.567
fundamental facts emerged from this that 
couldn't have been found any other way. Such as?

24:38.249 --> 24:43.994
Oh, the details of the, of course, this is where the 
plates are generated, the big plates. And we now

24:44.635 --> 24:49.079
know a great deal more about the emplacement of 
those plates than we knew before. Even though we'd

24:49.159 --> 24:53.724
been over the area quite thoroughly with surface 
ships, we just didn't have it all put together. But

24:54.705 --> 24:57.808
we know pretty much now about the spatial and time 
episodic activity that occurs there, and how the

24:58.430 --> 25:12.133
boundaries migrate with time, and how the 
volcanism migrates with time, both in the ridge

24:58.430 --> 25:12.133
axis and in the fracture zone. And I don't think we 
could have gotten that any other way. Well, you

25:15.418 --> 25:19.204
think submersibles then were necessary to prove 
plate tectonics? Yes. Well, to get these details,

25:19.985 --> 25:23.391
you couldn't have done it any other way. I'm not 
suggesting you rush out and give everybody a

25:23.675 --> 25:26.518
submersible. There's just a few jobs that 
submersibles can do, and that is one. I think there

25:30.723 --> 25:36.910
are a couple of other jobs a submersible can do, 
exploring canyons and things of the right size.

25:40.113 --> 25:41.955
And there will be more and more jobs for 
submersibles. But right now, without

25:42.115 --> 25:48.603
submersible technology, there are a few jobs they 
can do that are cost-effective. At least in my

25:48.643 --> 25:51.005
book, they are cost-effective. I think in most 
people's books, they're cost-effective. So a lot

25:54.556 --> 25:58.841
of things cost more than submersibles these days.

26:03.908 --> 26:08.614
It appears, I have a couple of questions too I want 
to ask very quickly that I was going to ask you later

26:03.908 --> 26:08.614
on. I'll put on tape now. It appears, though, 
however, that funding for oceanography is going

26:09.895 --> 26:15.402
to drop. It doesn't look like it's going to 
increase.

26:21.370 --> 26:29.299
And it also looks as if, because of international 
treaties, oceanography is going to have to move

26:21.370 --> 26:29.299
closer to shore than away from shore.

26:32.463 --> 26:34.966
Well, take it one at a time, OK? I

26:36.768 --> 26:46.820
have been in, as I mentioned before, I've only been 
in the oceanography game now seriously about 17

26:36.768 --> 26:46.820
years. And many other people have greater 
perspective, I suppose. And you look for

26:51.020 --> 26:57.289
long-term trends, and you try to see what the 
meaning of those are, what causes them. And there

26:58.832 --> 27:04.320
have been a few indicators, I think, that mark 
changes in the approach to oceanography. A very

27:06.242 --> 27:13.113
important thing has been the Navy's change in its 
attitude toward marine research. And here a few

27:13.974 --> 27:20.824
years ago, five to eight years ago, the Navy did 
change its attitude quite a bit. It essentially

27:21.530 --> 27:31.642
moved the research into its own laboratories 
instead of sponsoring so much outside because it

27:21.530 --> 27:31.642
felt like that would be more applied to their 
needs. But it did affect marine research. You

27:37.590 --> 27:48.583
know, the US Navy's research in their late 50s and 
early 60s is one of the things that helped us prove

27:37.590 --> 27:48.583
the theory of sea flow spreading. Particularly 
their magnetic work, all that was supported by the

27:49.610 --> 27:53.655
Navy in this country. The Navy did many things like 
that. Now they're kind of pulling out in many ways

27:58.401 --> 28:02.406
as far as purely academic research goes. And the 
National Science Foundation and other agencies

28:03.928 --> 28:11.178
are not picking up the ball quite as fast as the 
Navy's dropping it. Because they're all looking

28:12.299 --> 28:15.042
for applied things. They're not emphasizing as 
much basic science as they did in those days. So

28:19.765 --> 28:21.347
there's some of that. I don't think one ought to 
panic at these kinds of things. I think the

28:24.472 --> 28:25.794
pendulum will swing back. I think there's just 
natural fluctuations. The American public has to

28:28.358 --> 28:37.711
try the applied side, then they'll try the basic 
side, and they'll just swing back and forth a bit.

28:37.731 --> 28:43.260
I don't think we ever ought to go overboard in the 
research business. After all, research is a rare

28:43.280 --> 28:48.287
luxury for those of us who engage in it. You can't 
expect to supply research funds for half the

28:49.634 --> 28:53.459
United States. You really can't. So I think it 
should be for a few people. And

29:00.187 --> 29:05.834
you shouldn't expect too quick a turnaround on it. 
And for that reason, people shouldn't expect a lot

29:06.895 --> 29:09.619
of money to be poured into it. I mean, you just have 
to not ask for too much. But it is a bit unfortunate

29:13.884 --> 29:17.869
that the Navy didn't support research as much as it 
did, I think.
