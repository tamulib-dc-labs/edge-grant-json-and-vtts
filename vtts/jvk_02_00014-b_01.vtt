WEBVTT

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:10.621
Do you recall your feelings when you first went to a Yale practice or a Bonfire or a Muster or a Silver Taps?

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:14.306
Not a great deal.

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:18.792
One thing that did impress me, I guess, is during what they then called orientation.

00:00:18.812 --> 00:00:26.022
We went over to the MSC, to one of those larger rooms, and various people were being introduced.

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:31.968
And whoever was conducting, and I don't remember who, introduced the corps commander as a typical cadet.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.732
And I said, that would hardly wash.

00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:42.697
He would not be corps commander if he was the typical cadet.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:56.329
I guess because of my own background, I fit in very easily to the corps concept, to the military concept, to the head concept as far as departments.

00:00:57.136 --> 00:01:08.898
My own personal proclivities, probably from the president to the dean to the department head, I don't really have that much problem with a tight organization.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.703
Some people think it's the end of the world.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:18.756
And my own personal view is A&M has not done as well on its hiring since we went to the committee system.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:46.903
in the uh in 59 and their 60s uh dr nance was a department head frank hubert was the dean uh earl rutter was the president what do you what did you and your colleagues uh think about those you've already mentioned nance what'd you all think about most people appreciated frank and rudder

00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:59.760
To a degree, I think they appreciated the fact that he was probably in the right place at the right time as far as both racial integration is concerned and the mission of leaving.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.409
I think his own personality, prestige helped on that.

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:11.658
Sometime we got a lot bothered with his highway six rooms, north and south.

00:02:11.678 --> 00:02:16.165
I've never been a person who cares much about people with beards and mustaches.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:20.161
his view on shaving them off short of balmy.

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:31.419
Not as much as Mark Clark, President of the Citadel, saying that if you don't put flowers in your firebox, I'll have a university gardener do it for you.

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:38.831
Or don't be downtown Charleston coffee shop criticizing my policies.

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.916
Earl was nothing at all like that.

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:52.388
I remember one day at a meeting, I think it was over at whatever, the Sunday Holidays in Biological Sciences.

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:53.390
Let me back up a bit.

00:02:54.311 --> 00:03:04.883
Though I never pushed this hard, nor was I in a position to push this hard, I've always thought that A&M missed an opportunity in the community to be

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:16.830
a better server of the community as far as after hours education is concerned i don't think we've ever stepped up to that plate

00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:25.459
At one time there was somebody and I asked Mr. Rutter if he had any thought of giving it to that and he didn't give me much of an answer.

00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:44.269
Later in the 80s, when he was Director of Academic Service, I went up to Indianapolis University there to look at their extended education program where they had a lot of work on nights and weekends.

00:03:45.886 --> 00:04:08.316
set up with the local equivalent to Polish to use their training rooms because people couldn't park in the parking lot and profs teaching two regular courses in one course on the weekend or evening or whatever and I came back and made my report and I never get any support from the higher administration on that

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.867
This is part of my soapbox, and I've done so much about it in years.

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.954
I still don't think that we serve the local community.

00:04:18.978 --> 00:04:21.723
If a department wants to offer courses, they can.

00:04:22.404 --> 00:04:27.132
But my argument then and now would be until the administration decides

00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:37.275
that we're going to create an evening division about whatever name for the dean in charge with support is not going to happen.

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:45.046
Because education probably still offers more evening courses than anybody else, but a weekend course, a Saturday course.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.257
But back to your question, I always had a good relation with Dean Hubert.

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:56.123
I remember one time,

00:04:56.744 --> 00:05:06.276
After we got all our divorces and it was a college of liberal arts and he was dean of education, business was separated out against John Pearson as dean.

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:07.037
Was he the first dean?

00:05:07.718 --> 00:05:08.019
Yeah.

00:05:10.802 --> 00:05:14.146
And we were without a dean for whatever reason.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:22.157
And I mentioned that to you where you said, oh, you know, don't be in too big of a hurry, you might get something you don't want.

00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:25.401
And we got several that we didn't want.

00:05:26.883 --> 00:05:40.697
But to answer your question, I really don't think in the 50s and 60s that many faculty were that much concerned about the higher administration.

00:05:41.317 --> 00:05:48.905
I just never did sense they were concerned with their department head and their dean, especially at budget promotion time.

00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:56.232
But once you got beyond that, I don't think they got up in arms whether

00:05:56.212 --> 00:06:03.488
We had this person or that person or while Morgan left or whatever it may have been.

00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:30.083
In the early 60s, as the committees are appointed to look to the future as to what A&M ought to aspire to be, aspirations report, what do you think was your personal and those of your acquaintances, what was the reaction to the proposals about coeducation and all the other changes?

00:06:32.763 --> 00:06:35.006
to my own person and most of my colleagues.

00:06:36.608 --> 00:06:38.930
I didn't know anyone who did not support the co-ed.

00:06:40.913 --> 00:06:42.635
If it is, I missed it.

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:44.037
I missed it completely.

00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:53.949
I know in classes when we would talk about it, and the students would ask what I thought about it, and I'd say, I think we all have it, and so on.

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:58.534
Well, nothing but the mooses would come, and that's when I learned about the moose spot.

00:06:59.358 --> 00:07:02.223
And I guess you've heard about the moose spot.

00:07:02.503 --> 00:07:03.304
Describe it, though.

00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:06.930
Well, this is what it's described to me in a core outfit.

00:07:07.832 --> 00:07:10.977
And this is before women, or at least many women.

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:18.268
And girls would come in from TWU, UT, wherever, snook, old dime box, wherever.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.233
And in each outfit, there was a tin can.

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:25.500
And everybody put their nickels, dimes, and quarters, maybe even bills in it.

00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:35.138
And then after the weekend, there'd be a vote among the guys in the outfit as to who had the ugliest blind date.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.684
And that person got the moose pot.

00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:40.361
And that's what I was told by the students.

00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:41.803
I was not an Aggie.

00:07:42.323 --> 00:07:43.505
I did not participate.

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:51.355
But they would say in class discussion, nothing but the mooses would come.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:08:01.208
And I really would like to see some of those guys come back and see how attractive Clarkville Edge would stack up with anybody, any place.

00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:16.151
Do you remember any student or anyone else making an argument or anything against these changes?

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:19.997
Some of the students.

00:08:20.137 --> 00:08:21.078
Yeah.

00:08:21.118 --> 00:08:22.180
Some of the students.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.285
But I don't remember any petitions or any rallies.

00:08:25.665 --> 00:08:29.271
I guess what surprised me, there was less opposition

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:33.869
to racial integration than to sex integration.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.190
Right.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:42.784
Do you remember any event, negative event, in any fashion about racial integration?

00:08:42.804 --> 00:08:44.026
No, I do remember.

00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:46.450
Personally, as you know it,

00:08:47.324 --> 00:08:53.031
I had that new reserve unit in a middle hall in my office in the surrounding classrooms.

00:08:54.452 --> 00:08:59.859
And I remember looking at my desk one day and here was a black sailor at my door.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:08.248
He was a transfer student who had been in a reserve outfit in college elsewhere, transferred to A&M.

00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:13.855
He heard there was a reserve unit there in Navy uniform willing to join.

00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:23.456
And I looked up, I don't know if the shop showed on my face, and I should remember his name, I don't, but he was one of the early black students that was admitted.

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:31.374
But I didn't see much in the classroom, I didn't feel any antagonism towards the blacks.

00:09:31.574 --> 00:09:32.957
I've heard of women,

00:09:32.937 --> 00:09:37.704
with some of the first classes saying they'd walk by and a guy would beat you in the leg or in the rear.

00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:45.076
I never viewed it in my class and no female ever reported that to me that it happened.

00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:48.942
But certainly I don't remember anything about that.

00:09:49.042 --> 00:10:01.020
And there are those who argue that through the years we probably had someone from somewhere in South America, Puerto Rico, but who was from Puerto Rico or wherever where probably had as much

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:05.546
African blood as anyone, but no one ever said anything about it.

00:10:05.887 --> 00:10:24.189
But as far as this true integration, I was really proud and surprised that there was, I don't know of any demonstration or petition that says much more controversy over the initial reading of that.

00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:32.138
If there had been a secret ballot in the history department regarding coeducation,

00:10:33.147 --> 00:10:38.939
making the Corps voluntary, and racial integration, what do you think the vote would have been?

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:44.912
Do you think there would have been a few who had voted against it?

00:10:45.432 --> 00:10:51.941
I don't remember hearing any.

00:10:55.866 --> 00:11:03.135
Did you feel that you and your colleagues began to feel during the 60s that A&M was making progress?

00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:12.908
Making progress in expanding programs, yes.

00:11:14.677 --> 00:11:23.790
There are those who argue that maybe it's true that in the absence of racial integration and co-eds, there would still be 5,000 or 6,000 students.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.532
I don't know whether that's true or not.

00:11:25.973 --> 00:11:38.170
I don't think we'd be where we are today, but I don't know actually how much growth would have taken place.

00:11:43.718 --> 00:12:06.553
You know, maybe I was just to go longer, but I never thought in that sense, but I don't remember many of my colleagues out beating on drums to do this or do that or increase the programs or if someone proposed it, we said yes it's a good idea or bad idea, which really is that move to go on.

00:12:06.533 --> 00:12:15.161
I guess a term that later brought me more is world class, but I don't know what that means.

00:12:16.262 --> 00:12:18.625
I guess it means something to never use the phrase.

00:12:19.826 --> 00:12:35.781
But I think within the context of what this institution was and is, that it's made a remarkable growth, a remarkable adjustment to the changes.

00:12:36.335 --> 00:12:40.020
Many of the things we missed, we had a few streakers.

00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:56.183
And I don't know of any great movement on the part of any faculty to move into what some consider to be the academic university

00:12:56.635 --> 00:12:59.142
mainstream of the 60s.

00:12:59.162 --> 00:13:08.067
Maybe we were so enduring, we were so, quote, conservative, we just didn't think in those terms.

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:11.657
But I knew we had something going with our remarkable growth.

00:13:11.637 --> 00:13:13.700
in the 70s and 80s.

00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:22.071
As you well know, too fast a growth for the facilities that we had and the resources that we had.

00:13:23.293 --> 00:13:26.317
Let's see, anecdotes.

00:13:26.337 --> 00:13:34.067
See if you can remember and share with this machine any anecdotes about Aggie

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:46.132
good bull and or unique excuses that students may have tried to give you for, or pranks they tried to play in class or anywhere else?

00:13:46.733 --> 00:13:52.585
Well, don't know much about pranks in class.

00:13:52.605 --> 00:13:54.148
I didn't see them.

00:13:59.242 --> 00:14:00.824
You used the word excuse.

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:03.467
I found that the A student cheating one time.

00:14:04.188 --> 00:14:06.590
The crib was obviously there.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.032
So I asked the class I called him up.

00:14:08.052 --> 00:14:09.534
He said, well, I always did it in high school.

00:14:10.435 --> 00:14:12.357
I said, well, I don't care what you did in high school.

00:14:13.258 --> 00:14:14.379
You don't do it here.

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:20.266
Now, whether, you know, he was just saying there for one, something better to say.

00:14:22.068 --> 00:14:24.270
What about excuses for absence?

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:30.148
Most of them are pretty standard, like a sick relative or that or just had to go.

00:14:36.815 --> 00:14:49.549
Now I can relate something not directly related to my class, but as director of academic services where I had about 1,800-2,000 German studies students, I heard some very

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.145
None of us are unique, perhaps unusual.

00:14:54.786 --> 00:14:58.692
I had this father's son in the office.

00:14:58.712 --> 00:15:04.982
I dropped the ball and the daddy was indignant I mistreated his son because he did this, this, and this.

00:15:05.003 --> 00:15:08.989
And so we got to talking about what I had done and what the boy had done.

00:15:10.184 --> 00:15:13.731
Well he had a broken leg and was on crutches and so and so.

00:15:13.751 --> 00:15:17.839
So I first assumed it was the tail end semester and he missed finals.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:23.350
But as the conversation got around, it happened in the very first days of class.

00:15:24.352 --> 00:15:28.260
And I said well, and the boys said I couldn't get to class.

00:15:28.645 --> 00:15:32.793
And I would say, well, you didn't have friends you could have to get there.

00:15:32.853 --> 00:15:34.717
You didn't know anyone you could have to get there.

00:15:34.737 --> 00:15:36.982
And you didn't have crutches or whatever.

00:15:37.923 --> 00:15:43.735
But then as the conversation went on and on, the glare from the father turned from me

00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:45.278
to the boy.

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:57.477
By the time we were through, he almost took him by the ear and broke him out and apologized to me because his son had painted this picture of that mean old guy.

00:15:57.978 --> 00:16:00.542
He just kicked me out.

00:16:00.522 --> 00:16:15.107
The second one, not quite the same, I heard a student, this is the first floor of Harrington, the exterior's closed in, and these partitions around, no rail walls, no rail doors.

00:16:15.868 --> 00:16:17.351
I heard this wailing and moaning.

00:16:18.212 --> 00:16:24.403
Ned Guthrie, who was my associate director, called and said, Garland, can you help to this?

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:32.438
This girl came in and secular reported she walked in the front door, falling down on her hands and knees, just wailing the bottom.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:46.425
So it finally got her calmed down and she couldn't believe that she had been dropped from university after her first semester because she had a .4.

00:16:49.105 --> 00:16:51.668
I thought I had a semester to mess around.

00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:57.596
I said, well, now, who told you that that you didn't?

00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:03.142
I said, now, if you go somewhere, I don't care if we're going to bring you back 12, 15 hours, 18 days, I will consider it.

00:17:03.163 --> 00:17:06.507
I read the letter, and she went on down the way.

00:17:07.388 --> 00:17:09.230
That's not a prank.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:14.977
I didn't see too many pranks in the way.

00:17:14.997 --> 00:17:15.358
Did you ever?

00:17:15.378 --> 00:17:17.560
I'm not sure that what she was saying was an excuse.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.842
She was just trying to

00:17:20.037 --> 00:17:23.502
I assume they had a semester to mess around.

00:17:24.764 --> 00:17:48.998
In all of your years at A&M, as a faculty member and then as an advisor, did you ever have any effort by a parent from off campus, a truly outside administrator or a politician or a, quote, rich Aggie attempt to pressure you?

00:17:50.935 --> 00:18:01.829
I had a few calls from Bob Cherry about representing the so-and-so son or congressman or state senator, so-and-so.

00:18:01.849 --> 00:18:04.151
And what would be the nature of those?

00:18:04.372 --> 00:18:06.394
I don't know whether you'd call it pressure or not.

00:18:06.414 --> 00:18:08.217
He called inquirer about it.

00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:15.666
And I would explain to him what I thought and what I knew about the student.

00:18:16.547 --> 00:18:18.109
And he said, well, I'm just going to ask.

00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.672
And then...

00:18:22.964 --> 00:18:26.553
I do not remember the gentleman's name, but he was the president of Portland Students.

00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:36.778
And I dropped his son and I called Randy and said, Randy, you may hear something about this, but we never did.

00:18:36.798 --> 00:18:38.863
I had a board member's son.

00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:41.596
and I never heard.

00:18:42.858 --> 00:18:47.164
One board member's son, Ed Cooker, called me about and we agreed to meet.

00:18:47.684 --> 00:18:48.305
We didn't meet.

00:18:48.425 --> 00:18:50.648
Ross Weisenbaker.

00:18:50.668 --> 00:18:51.750
And apparently they wanted me to move.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.033
He got squared away and eventually I just agreed.

00:18:55.394 --> 00:19:02.083
On occasion I had calls from the athletic department, but in all the years, I don't remember

00:19:03.498 --> 00:19:06.621
any real pressure.

00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:09.083
There would be inquiries about it.

00:19:09.404 --> 00:19:17.471
I've heard other colleagues say that they felt they were pressured by them, but that may be a matter of definition.

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:25.980
But I would simply say whether as an administrator in academic services or as a problem, well here's the person's record and here's what we did.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.665
Did any department head ever kind of call you on the carpet

00:19:32.084 --> 00:19:37.631
about the grades that you had given out as being too much or too few of anything?

00:19:39.573 --> 00:19:40.754
I don't remember ever.

00:19:42.957 --> 00:19:49.425
And I assume that Dr. Nance may have shaken his head occasionally over some of what we may have done.

00:19:49.445 --> 00:19:55.332
I think we all experienced this, the enormous differences in classes.

00:19:55.352 --> 00:19:59.577
I remember very well one summer session I had two sections of 105 or 106.

00:20:00.012 --> 00:20:03.157
and one in nearly all ACBs and one in all CCDs.

00:20:03.177 --> 00:20:07.364
I mean, it's probably been a random assignment, though.

00:20:07.384 --> 00:20:10.389
Oh, that leads me to a good one.

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:23.590
Compare the students who took summer classes at A&M in those first years, the makeup of your class in summer compared to the fall and spring.

00:20:25.443 --> 00:20:27.745
In the early years, it would not be that much different.

00:20:27.825 --> 00:20:31.909
In the later years, we had these provisional students that were needed.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.493
But you had women in those first summers.

00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:38.316
Oh, okay.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.244
And weren't things more relaxed among the students?

00:20:50.548 --> 00:20:51.889
Without the uniforms and...

00:20:52.865 --> 00:20:53.726
Probably so.

00:20:53.747 --> 00:21:06.829
I didn't, I guess I was more struck by the difference in the performance of one class compared to the other, but in theory they'd all been assigned to these classes roughly the same way.

00:21:08.312 --> 00:21:11.818
They were not assigned on SAT or anything else.

00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:17.708
But you're probably true, the summer classes were the mixed

00:21:18.211 --> 00:21:40.217
Do you remember having any impression that Mr.

00:21:40.297 --> 00:21:43.341
Rudder's health was declining not long before his death?

00:21:55.353 --> 00:21:58.676
Not that I can remember any overt information.

00:21:58.836 --> 00:21:59.557
Like I don't.

00:22:00.458 --> 00:22:02.620
I don't know of any.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.023
I had Annie in class while she was going.

00:22:07.804 --> 00:22:09.145
I had her one summer.

00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:15.731
And I would see her cage there, but she never said anything.

00:22:15.811 --> 00:22:17.593
Of course, I'm not sure she knew.

00:22:20.115 --> 00:22:23.318
Do you remember when or how you heard the news that he had died?

00:22:27.078 --> 00:22:30.322
No, I remember where I was when Jarvis Miller was NASA's president.

00:22:30.342 --> 00:22:31.344
I was in the MSC then.

00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:32.105
Yeah, all right.

00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:33.366
Well, we'll get to that one later.

00:22:34.568 --> 00:22:42.719
Speaking about remembering, do you remember where you were when you heard the news that JFK had been shot?

00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:44.281
I was just going to my class in Nagel.

00:22:45.182 --> 00:22:47.425
I just walked in and someone came in.

00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:50.790
And you and I were— Whatever that floor was.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:23:17.352
all right and then we were going to go to lunch in the msc and i was saying hurry up let's and you were saying listen to the radio uh and uh we were all stunned uh all right then when dr williams came do you remember any reaction to him or any feeling what did you begin to see in him as a president huh

00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:26.825
Of course, I didn't see him that much.

00:23:29.388 --> 00:23:33.814
I would see him around.

00:23:33.854 --> 00:23:35.316
I'd go to functions where he was.

00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:39.341
But I would not have the close contact that you would.

00:23:40.342 --> 00:23:44.908
Occasionally going down to either your office there or to John's or wherever, I would

00:23:47.099 --> 00:24:03.666
which since I just recall, you know, how well he was welcomed and the fact that he was, you know, a first-rate person and administrator, but I don't have any feeling beyond this like a vague notion on that.

00:24:03.686 --> 00:24:07.913
All right, in the department by that time there's a master's program.

00:24:07.953 --> 00:24:13.782
Do you remember many history majors in your early years?

00:24:15.297 --> 00:24:17.679
You ever know of one man named Lushani?

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.161
Do you remember that name?

00:24:19.181 --> 00:24:19.421
Yeah.

00:24:20.923 --> 00:24:23.585
He was one of our earlier masters.

00:24:23.605 --> 00:24:24.726
I don't know who he worked for.

00:24:24.786 --> 00:24:29.471
He's now the finance man for the experiment station.

00:24:29.491 --> 00:24:30.532
How would that be spelled?

00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:30.973
Do you know?

00:24:31.413 --> 00:24:34.736
L-I-C-C-O-N. Oh, Lichoni.

00:24:34.997 --> 00:24:35.457
Lichoni.

00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:35.778
Yeah.

00:24:36.358 --> 00:24:39.521
L-I-C-O-N-N-E or something like that?

00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:39.761
Yeah.

00:24:40.242 --> 00:24:41.423
In fact, he ought to be a guy.

00:24:41.723 --> 00:24:43.045
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:43.205 --> 00:24:44.286
He's hung around here.

00:24:44.326 --> 00:24:45.287
Yeah.

00:24:45.689 --> 00:24:48.194
When I get up I get the phone book.

00:24:48.534 --> 00:24:49.857
I get it now, that's on my mind.

00:24:50.057 --> 00:24:51.400
That's all right.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.141
I got it written here.

00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:53.924
I think it's David.

00:24:53.944 --> 00:24:56.649
Yeah, I think it is David.

00:24:56.729 --> 00:25:00.897
He went down to Gouchner for a while in some capacity.

00:25:01.231 --> 00:25:12.309
He was brought back here to either the Experiment Station or Extinction Service and I think he's, I'd use the word chief fiscal person or somewhere in that category.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:22.446
Okay and so under Williams, in the early 70s, did you and your colleagues think that we were making headway?

00:25:22.696 --> 00:25:28.865
Well, we just thought, we all learned that the fact that you got a historian-administrator job doesn't mean a damn thing.

00:25:29.766 --> 00:25:37.216
As far as people who say, man, you have him, you ought to get our, the dean is a historian.

00:25:37.357 --> 00:25:44.467
I never saw any advantage, nor disadvantage, to having a person of a particular discipline.

00:25:44.607 --> 00:25:47.290
All right, and David Maxwell was by this time the dean.

00:25:47.771 --> 00:25:49.834
What about your perception of him?

00:25:50.303 --> 00:25:51.244
Well it was mixed.

00:25:51.605 --> 00:25:53.767
You know I finally finished my degree while I was here.

00:25:53.787 --> 00:26:04.080
It got through all the promotions and he was a little hack that I came in late wanting to be promoted but he did it.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:11.709
I'm trying to think of who.

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.714
Who did he go to a bar to try to rescue?

00:26:15.754 --> 00:26:16.935
Some department head.

00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:19.842
I don't, yeah.

00:26:19.962 --> 00:26:30.878
Okay, Dr. Nance then retired, and he was replaced by, from Oklahoma, and moved up to Telluride.

00:26:33.823 --> 00:26:34.323
Oh, boy.

00:26:36.046 --> 00:26:44.398
I can remember the interview, when he was interviewed.

00:26:44.418 --> 00:26:46.281
His friend was Shirley Black.

00:26:50.564 --> 00:27:05.488
I tried to call him because he's up the road in Silverton.

00:27:06.028 --> 00:27:10.716
How did the department change under his headship?

00:27:11.157 --> 00:27:12.919
He wasn't much of a department head.

00:27:14.141 --> 00:27:16.906
He got promoted to be associate dean.

00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:18.428
So he was more of a chairman?

00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:25.813
No, well that's when we were making this transition to a chair.

00:27:28.962 --> 00:27:32.232
I guess I thought he was not very positive in his leadership.

00:27:34.388 --> 00:27:36.373
a drifter.

00:27:37.376 --> 00:27:44.534
Not that he was driven, but he just sort of let things, wasn't laid back, just sort of let things go, is my impression of him.

00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:47.261
And was there a shift more to committees?

00:27:47.762 --> 00:27:49.647
Yes, always through years, there's more.

00:27:51.618 --> 00:27:54.242
I don't think you really like to make decisions.

00:27:54.262 --> 00:27:54.523
All right.

00:27:54.743 --> 00:28:03.818
During then, during the later 70s, 80s, well, until your retirement, there were a number of department heads.

00:28:03.979 --> 00:28:05.161
I'm not going to ask the negative.

00:28:05.181 --> 00:28:12.513
Who would you give the highest marks to among that group of department chairmen?

00:28:13.996 --> 00:28:14.196
Okay.

00:28:14.256 --> 00:28:16.680
See, in 79 I became director of academic services.

00:28:16.964 --> 00:28:19.267
All right, describe that function.

00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:21.390
Yeah, we'll get back.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.173
Okay, okay.

00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:27.819
For how many years, I don't know.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:35.269
You may remember until 54 or 55, we had a basic division somewhere along in there.

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:40.216
It was after I came to England where all freshmen went into that.

00:28:41.178 --> 00:28:44.322
Then for years, we had these undecided majors.

00:28:45.263 --> 00:28:51.609
You ended up being in the College of Liberal Arts, not in the College of General Studies, too.

00:28:51.629 --> 00:29:02.719
But in the summer of 79, Prescott, McCandless, and I guess Jarvis, is he president now?

00:29:02.739 --> 00:29:04.060
Not 79, no.

00:29:05.021 --> 00:29:07.223
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:13.549
Decided that it should be separate from any college.

00:29:14.204 --> 00:29:19.549
because some of the colleges said, well, liberal arts is taming those people.

00:29:19.589 --> 00:29:23.533
So academic service created that summer.

00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:30.779
And in that was the general studies program, study abroad, provisional students.

00:29:33.321 --> 00:29:39.907
I began that fall a new faculty orientation where we called, put them on the payroll.

00:29:39.927 --> 00:29:41.629
First time we'd ever had that.

00:29:42.537 --> 00:29:46.782
I was also the liaison with TU Galveston.

00:29:46.882 --> 00:29:52.709
I went down there once a month to sit on their APC.

00:29:52.729 --> 00:30:02.761
And our main, our main professor was a journal studies student.

00:30:02.781 --> 00:30:06.746
And in theory you could be in there until you had 60 hours.

00:30:07.807 --> 00:30:11.211
Some were 50, 30, but also

00:30:11.191 --> 00:30:14.276
I was, I guess, the way I read it was sort of liberal.

00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:19.023
I even had seniors transfer in who were in a major that they were unhappy with.

00:30:19.885 --> 00:30:22.729
I understand later after I retired they became more restrictive.

00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:28.238
But I looked at it as a place for those who did not know where they wanted to go or what they wanted to do.

00:30:28.218 --> 00:30:43.953
Now, also, every time I talk to freshman parents, I said, do not be concerned that your student is in general studies major, because in this, they have a variety of opportunities they can move into.

00:30:43.974 --> 00:30:47.762
And by the time we retired in 86, we had about 2,000 students in there.

00:30:48.367 --> 00:30:53.821
Early on, I mentioned I always thought the university should have an evening program of whatever name.

00:30:54.743 --> 00:31:04.047
I also think, and we talked about it, to have a separate, I won't use the word college, but

00:31:05.005 --> 00:31:07.810
that would be an expanded general studies program.

00:31:09.172 --> 00:31:17.666
Now, in competence, were the students in that program, were they similar to the rest of the?

00:31:17.686 --> 00:31:17.966
The rest.

00:31:18.948 --> 00:31:23.435
They were going to majors end up at three A's and four O's, the way as anybody else would.

00:31:23.455 --> 00:31:28.704
In fact, one young man that we interviewed for a Rhodes Scholar as a C.E.U.

00:31:28.764 --> 00:31:31.789
major, I believe had started out,

00:31:32.174 --> 00:31:48.378
Now, you reported in that function, you reported to whom?

00:31:48.899 --> 00:31:49.680
To the provost.

00:31:50.181 --> 00:31:52.083
And y'all were located physically where?

00:31:54.587 --> 00:31:56.850
And that was a full, you didn't teach at all?

00:31:58.292 --> 00:32:00.696
Two courses, okay.
