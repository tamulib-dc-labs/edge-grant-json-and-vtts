WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:27.338
that then we interrogated him and then after that 
by by a policy of the American government we called

00:01.330 --> 00:27.338
in a chopper because we were sitting out in the 
middle of nowhere we called in a chopper and sent

00:01.330 --> 00:27.338
him back for higher up interrogation and that's 
where actually physically they more did the

00:01.330 --> 00:27.338
interrogation back there to higher headquarters 
and found out that he was more that that's what he

00:01.330 --> 00:27.338
was he was a he was sent in to infiltrate get 
dimensions of the camp so that when he left there

00:27.925 --> 00:43.482
that later on if we got hit at night and stuff like 
this that they would have had all the dimensions so

00:27.925 --> 00:43.482
they would know how to shoot their mortars in and 
hit our bunkers and things like this which would

00:27.925 --> 00:43.482
have really been real bad for us. While you were 
there, did any of your good friends lose their

00:44.924 --> 00:48.408
lives? Yes, in the same camp we had this guy, a 
medic. We have, normally in the Mike Force, when

00:55.229 --> 01:14.894
they go out in Ranger outfits, when they went out 
when we were in Spaceship Forces, there was

00:55.229 --> 01:14.894
usually only two Americans go out, and they were 
out on a search with the Mike Force, and they got

00:55.229 --> 01:14.894
ambushed, and he was killed with a .50 caliber 
machine gun bullets. He tried to rush it to save

01:15.495 --> 01:18.238
everybody else. It was a real bad fall fright, and 
he just got up and tried to rushed a machine gun and

01:24.170 --> 01:28.136
he didn't make it. How did y'all react to such 
events? Were y'all getting used to losing

01:30.840 --> 01:33.884
friends? Well, he was closer to most of the Special 
Forces guy because we had our own people there. I

01:41.556 --> 01:52.472
physically knew the guy and as all death and stuff 
you feel it's the same way even if he's being killed

01:41.556 --> 01:52.472
when you're out in combat and you see them being 
killed. It is no different, really. Somebody

01:55.291 --> 01:59.807
being shot or killed is the same, even though he was 
a Vietnamese or the Americans. You feel bad,

02:01.272 --> 02:02.918
but... If you look at it in a war, that's some of the 
things it's just a risk you take when you're in a

02:04.231 --> 02:09.317
fight. So when you witnessed such things, you 
never questioned the American government reason

02:10.178 --> 02:16.645
for being there? For example, when you lost your 
friends or the people you knew, did you ever say, is

02:16.665 --> 02:23.573
this all worth it? I really never thought we were 
there or the American people was not, even because

02:24.895 --> 02:31.943
we were there, sent there, to support the people so 
I had no aggravation against if a friend of mine got

02:33.526 --> 03:03.263
killed or things like this it just yes I felt bad but 
uh this was part of his job as a military he accepted

02:33.526 --> 03:03.263
that responsibility when he joined the army and 
that's the reason why he he was trying to save lives

02:33.526 --> 03:03.263
I guess when he got killed and these were things 
that you do under those type of situations and uh

02:33.526 --> 03:03.263
death is death and uh It's bad, but you have to learn 
to accept it when you're in those type of

03:04.306 --> 03:13.476
situations and seeing people killed around you. 
Fortunately, I never seen as much of it as these

03:15.238 --> 03:26.229
guys did because I always stayed in the camps 
because all we did was build a special camp because

03:15.238 --> 03:26.229
we were just engineers, combat engineers. We only 
fought as combat engineers or fight as infantry

03:26.770 --> 03:33.537
upon being attacked. and things like this. Yes, 
I've seen people killed, and I've seen people

03:35.056 --> 03:38.681
brought in killed. Who

03:39.722 --> 03:59.085
do you blame for America's,

03:39.722 --> 03:59.085
as you have said that you don't believe that 
America lost in Vietnam, who do you blame for

03:39.722 --> 03:59.085
America's pulling out of Vietnam? I think the 
public, the non-military people,

04:00.770 --> 04:09.918
your mothers, your fathers, different things 
like this. And I think there was a lot of your

04:09.998 --> 04:24.611
governors and senators and different things like 
this from different states and stuff like this

04:09.998 --> 04:24.611
that did not support Vietnam, which they talked 
against it. They didn't want to see the American

04:24.652 --> 04:27.494
troops there and things. So once it became enough 
of them could push it through, then they actually

04:32.107 --> 04:43.123
forced us to come out of Vietnam, I think, 
politically because of the senators, governors,

04:32.107 --> 04:43.123
mothers and fathers. The people just did not want 
us there no longer because we were not

04:44.225 --> 04:47.870
accomplishing anything. And I think the American 
people, even the American forces, looked at it

04:49.833 --> 04:57.945
that way, too, because our hands were tied in a lot 
of situations.

04:59.090 --> 05:10.483
You could not cross the Hanoi or go across the 
Cambodian border or something like this or things

04:59.090 --> 05:10.483
like this when that was where they were always 
heading back to when you were chasing them or doing

04:59.090 --> 05:10.483
things like this or fighting them. So do you think 
it was alright for Richard Nixon to invade

05:11.785 --> 05:16.070
Cambodia? Do you think that was a proper action? We 
had gone and invaded a neutral country. We were

05:20.715 --> 05:26.742
just expanding the war I think then because if we 
kept expanding it there we were just going to

05:20.715 --> 05:26.742
prolong the war. So... And plus that was still 
spreading, like I was saying before, I think,

05:28.621 --> 05:41.397
during the talk, that the war is still going on over 
there in Cambodia because of the refugees and

05:28.621 --> 05:41.397
stuff like this. There are other communists that 
we're trying to infiltrate in certain areas of

05:42.799 --> 05:51.891
Cambodia, and there's just a minute of 
resistance, real resistance against the forces

05:42.799 --> 05:51.891
that are there. We support it a little bit, but we 
don't support it as much as we do down in Honduras

05:53.713 --> 05:58.459
right now. in Nicaragua or something like that. 
We're supporting the Contras a lot more in

06:00.834 --> 06:07.543
fighting down there than we are in Cambodia. We 
probably support those people, but not as an

06:07.584 --> 06:14.694
all-out public thing. Do you see a similarity 
between Nicaragua and Vietnam? A lot of people say

06:18.179 --> 06:19.882
that Nicaragua will be... There's a possibility, 
yes. There could be a possibility that right now

06:20.983 --> 06:27.433
we've had American troops lose their lives down 
there. Already there's been some American people

06:27.818 --> 06:32.944
shot in helicopters and things like this in their 
support. Those are how Vietnam started. Like I was

06:35.607 --> 06:41.174
saying at the first of the talk, that when we 
entered Vietnam, we had advisories there. What we

06:41.935 --> 06:46.360
have in Nicaragua and things right now are 
advisories. We also have engineer units down

06:46.380 --> 06:50.986
there building roads and different things like 
this. It's silhouatic. This is the way Vietnam

06:52.207 --> 06:53.809
started. And it all depends on really the 
government, what they want to do about supporting

06:54.667 --> 07:04.000
those people, of sending American forces in that 
area. If they do, then it could end up being the same

07:05.061 --> 07:09.487
thing as Vietnam. So if you were an advisor to 
President George Bush, would you advise him

07:09.507 --> 07:20.202
against getting involved in Nicaragua or 
supporting the Contras?

07:22.713 --> 07:43.595
If I was looking at it on a military aspect,

07:22.713 --> 07:43.595
and having to go back into combat and fight for a 
country

07:22.713 --> 07:43.595
of that nature, that if our country's President 
Bush, as the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S.

07:43.615 --> 07:47.539
Forces, and he fully believed that if we sent 
American forces down there, that later on in the

07:47.992 --> 08:11.367
years, because of us being there, that people 
would be free and not under a dictator or communist

07:47.992 --> 08:11.367
leadership, which would be part of our duty as one 
of the high forces NATO or anything of the

08:12.325 --> 08:38.400
government to support our comrades in arms if it 
was became necessary but it would only be the

08:12.325 --> 08:38.400
decision of probably the president and the public 
because I think the public's going to be more

08:12.325 --> 08:38.400
involved in this type of war because I think the 
people are looking at it if we do send troops there

08:12.325 --> 08:38.400
it's going to end up being like another Vietnam and 
they're they're not wanting that so they're

08:12.325 --> 08:38.400
they're really holding off and not wanting to do it 
I think. So we're not, it's gonna, we're gonna send

08:39.961 --> 08:55.331
advisories, we're gonna support them, and 
probably stay out of it as much as we can unless it,

08:39.961 --> 08:55.331
unless Russia or Cuba or, it really becomes bigger 
than what it is right now before we probably send

08:39.961 --> 08:55.331
troops down there, I think. If somebody would 
probably, Russia would end up sending troops

08:55.652 --> 09:00.321
there. or something like that, then we might be 
more involved of getting involved like we did in

09:01.415 --> 09:06.087
Cuba. When Russia put missiles in Cuba, we got 
involved.

09:13.006 --> 09:16.234
What role do you think did media have in Vietnam? Do 
you think that Walter Cronkite had questioned

09:18.526 --> 09:22.992
America's involvement? They were saying that, 
how can we save a country by destroying it? A lot of

09:27.558 --> 09:29.280
media people were saying this. And a lot of people 
blame media for losing the war. They said that they

09:32.965 --> 09:39.633
didn't have faith in the American ability to carry 
on. And a lot of people got discouraged because I

09:42.421 --> 09:59.820
think this was true, the media played a big part in 
getting us out of Vietnam because of what they

09:42.421 --> 09:59.820
published in their media and sending it back here 
to the Americans that lived in the United States or

09:42.421 --> 09:59.820
back here, that this did not sit well with the 
Americans. That's the reason why more so the

09:59.860 --> 10:09.610
public, because of the press, that we ended up 
being pulled out of Vietnam because the press,

09:59.860 --> 10:09.610
well the press helped. and, or the media. So do you 
think it was right for them to help? It's not that I

10:17.834 --> 10:19.396
don't think they helped. I think they just was 
doing, feeling they were doing their job just as

10:19.516 --> 10:31.855
well as we were doing our job as government, being 
sent there from the government as a fighting force

10:19.516 --> 10:31.855
to support the Vietnamese government. They were 
there doing a job, and they felt that's what they

10:32.376 --> 10:37.023
do. So I guess...

10:45.179 --> 10:54.267
What do you think are the lessons that United 
States can learn from Vietnam?

10:54.567 --> 10:58.331
How can we avoid another Vietnam? Are there any 
words of wisdom you can say? Not really. I guess the

11:02.615 --> 11:09.321
only thing would be just like to say if I...

11:09.341 --> 11:14.325
It all depends on how well they want to let the 
American forces after... They sent us there to let

11:15.301 --> 11:22.909
the American people with the American military do 
their job. I think that if you let the generals in

11:23.509 --> 11:42.709
the military do their job instead of being 
political about it, like they said when

11:23.509 --> 11:42.709
MacArthur, because MacArthur got fired, because 
MacArthur was wanting to go in and go all through

11:23.509 --> 11:42.709
Korea. China. and probably if Truman would not 
have stood in his way and he would have gave to

11:43.786 --> 12:00.286
MacArthur's thing, our world might have been a 
little bit different in Korea or different things

11:43.786 --> 12:00.286
like this because we were already at war. If you're 
going to accomplish something, I guess you could

12:00.346 --> 12:09.017
be like Genghis Khan, just keep going. And it might 
have changed the world, but you never know. We

12:12.562 --> 12:15.668
could still be maybe even fighting the war yet. So 
you think American people should just place their

12:17.451 --> 12:23.803
faith in the hands of their commander-in-chief 
and the army? That's why we elected him there in the

12:23.823 --> 12:29.233
forces or into the government. if you don't like 
what he's doing in four years you just re-elect

12:30.614 --> 12:54.951
somebody else that you think but he could be the 
same way he could still be putting you or our

12:30.614 --> 12:54.951
american forces in anything it all depends it all 
depends on what really i think goes on in the

12:30.614 --> 12:54.951
government and since we're going down here at the 
low thing and only listen to the media that they

12:30.614 --> 12:54.951
know more than what the media does sometimes 
because they've got our intelligence and things

12:30.614 --> 12:54.951
like this that that there could be really a need, 
and if they say, okay, we've got to send forces to

12:55.218 --> 13:11.087
that area to accomplish a mission to keep the 
people free there, then that would be the decision

12:55.218 --> 13:11.087
of the government, which for the president to do 
it, he still has to have the Senate approve it and

12:55.218 --> 13:11.087
things like this. So it's hard for him to do things 
like that right now, I think, because of the

13:11.127 --> 13:19.302
political situation we had in Nam.

13:35.127 --> 13:38.592
What do you believe should be the course of our 
foreign policy? For example, do you believe that

13:39.033 --> 13:44.461
it is the duty of America to fight communism in the 
world? Or do you think we should try to live side by

13:44.982 --> 13:49.469
side with the communist countries? I think we're 
learning to accept and live with the communist

13:51.672 --> 14:04.071
countries as we're going, just like Nixon, or not 
Nixon, but Bush and Gorbachev are negotiating

14:04.253 --> 14:07.496
about nuclear missiles and things like this. It's 
not that we're living side by side, but we're

14:08.297 --> 14:17.405
negotiating for both our futures because of the 
nuclear weapons that we're supposed to be

14:08.297 --> 14:17.405
disarming. And these are supposed to be monitored 
real closely to make sure that Russia is doing it.

14:21.629 --> 14:26.513
And a lot of times, we may do something, but Russia 
don't do it if you don't watch them. So these type of

14:26.594 --> 14:32.539
things will probably, through the government, 
will just have to be closely monitored to live side

14:33.329 --> 14:34.691
by side with them. We're accepting them now.

14:39.496 --> 14:43.100
People, when they talk about communism, do they 
really know what communism is? It's a word to them.

14:46.925 --> 14:58.138
The only way I think they really would know 
communism would be go to Russia and live as a

14:46.925 --> 14:58.138
Russian under their dictatorship of communism. 
It'd be the same as the Russians coming here. They

15:01.421 --> 15:02.863
like to come here and live because we have a lot of 
communism living in our country right now

15:04.244 --> 15:29.931
because they want they like the American freedom 
but they still for their own government and their

15:04.244 --> 15:29.931
own keeping their own instead of becoming 
American citizens they still are Russians or

15:04.244 --> 15:29.931
whatever nationality that they are here under 
communism are still claiming that they're

15:04.244 --> 15:29.931
communism but they're living in America If that's 
the case, why not for them to go back to Russia and

15:30.721 --> 15:41.816
let the people explain to them why am I living in 
America to get away from communism? To me, it's all

15:41.836 --> 15:42.837
he's doing. He's getting away from communism even 
though in his own mind he's away from communism.

15:47.783 --> 16:00.340
He's only supporting his government or his 
country in his mind, but living a good life here in

15:47.783 --> 16:00.340
America because everybody likes to come to 
America, even the Vietnamese and... Even I think

16:01.720 --> 16:18.528
in any war that we fought, the American people, 
when you were in France and Poland, any place where

16:01.720 --> 16:18.528
we were at, the American GIs, the Polish and the 
French and everything, the women and the kids and

16:01.720 --> 16:18.528
everybody wanted to come to America. They loved to 
come to America because it was a land of plenty. And

16:24.618 --> 16:27.002
the Russia comes here and lives He's not under 
communism as long as he's living here. We just know

16:30.856 --> 16:36.869
that he's here because he is transferred from 
government to government or he's got diplomatic

16:30.856 --> 16:36.869
immunity or whatever. And he just lives here. To 
me, we're living beside communism. It's just that

16:43.282 --> 16:46.088
we're accepting it. Harry Truman had once said 
that it must be the policy of the United States to

16:47.097 --> 16:59.388
resist communism and stop communism and help any 
free people who are trying to resist communism.

16:59.908 --> 17:09.016
And one of the reasons our government said we went 
into Vietnam was that Truman doctrine that we were

16:59.908 --> 17:09.016
trying to help free people. I think that's the 
reason why we got involved in Vietnam War. I think

17:12.079 --> 17:15.602
if we get involved in Honduras or any other... type 
of war or communism type situation where we're in

17:16.527 --> 17:43.750
his theory of why we should fight communism that 
would be the reason that there that we would get

17:16.527 --> 17:43.750
involved because that is one of our American as you 
were saying in Truman's doctrine that he would

17:16.527 --> 17:43.750
like to support the American people would 
demolish communism if they could and support

17:43.898 --> 17:48.426
anybody that asked our help to keep becoming 
communism. So do you think we should still follow

17:49.027 --> 17:51.151
that principle? I think we should. I don't think, 
if we're going to keep our freedom of speech and

17:53.815 --> 18:07.780
everything like this, because if you take 
probably communism, I think some of your freedom

17:53.815 --> 18:07.780
of speech and doing things that we do now would 
be... uh... dominated we would not have our bill of

18:08.148 --> 18:37.024
rights if we probably come under uh... communism 
where we where if we come under communism i think

18:08.148 --> 18:37.024
the bill of rights and our freedom of speech and 
different things like this might be a little more

18:08.148 --> 18:37.024
hindrance and your way of life would be a little bit 
more hindrance in some ways for what they do in in

18:08.148 --> 18:37.024
probably communism way of doctrine it's probably 
fairly good because everybody's equal to Same.

18:38.021 --> 18:41.646
The government gives them everything, and it's 
divided the country. It's supposed to be divided

18:41.666 --> 18:45.791
to eagerly be entered, but the government's still 
got control. Where the American people, as we do at

18:46.732 --> 18:52.059
the Bill of Rights, we have the freedom of speech. 
If we own something, it is ours. It's not the

18:55.783 --> 18:56.624
government's. We're in probably a communism 
country. Very few people own a lot of stuff. It

19:02.952 --> 19:04.294
belongs to the government or something. So you 
believe that the people who want to endorse

19:04.797 --> 19:15.992
communism should be left alone, but the people who 
ask for America's help for freedom should be

19:04.797 --> 19:15.992
helped by the United States. But for example, the 
Soviet Union, after the Tsarist regime wanted

19:16.313 --> 19:32.475
communism, the people in them, and the other 
countries of Eastern Europe who have endorsed

19:16.313 --> 19:32.475
communism, it must not be the policy of the United 
States to free those countries, right? If that's

19:33.586 --> 19:39.733
what they want, there's nothing for the US 
government to do about it if the country wants to

19:33.586 --> 19:39.733
endorse communism. If the government does not 
want to abolish

19:41.254 --> 19:59.914
and accept communism, then the United States has 
nothing to do about going in and stopping the

19:41.254 --> 19:59.914
government if the country wants to become 
communism, it just becomes communism. But if they

20:04.262 --> 20:12.109
would ask our help to stop communism or something 
like this, it might be our duty to come in. It all

20:12.749 --> 20:13.991
depends on the situation. Really, is it that 
important of us being there to stop communism

20:15.272 --> 20:25.220
before we get involved, just like we do in Honduras 
or Nicaragua? Right now, I don't think it's worth

20:26.461 --> 20:29.344
it to get down and be involved unless Russia or the 
Cubans would really come up and put a big force or

20:30.472 --> 20:42.029
something in there where they would escalate more 
of the war down there than what it is right now. If

20:42.890 --> 20:59.955
Russia would actually send big troops like they 
did in Afghanistan to there, or Cuba and stuff

20:42.890 --> 20:59.955
would send a lot of things there and start putting 
missiles or things like this, this would be a

20:42.890 --> 20:59.955
hindrance to us for them to be there because of the 
situation of them being able to do their...

21:00.307 --> 21:11.027
different things within that area, it'd be a 
highly military intelligence for them to,

21:00.307 --> 21:11.027
especially if they're communists, to find out 
about what we're doing. They could put radar or all

21:11.908 --> 21:19.142
depends on what they put up, but they could be doing 
stuff here, which would affect our country. So if

21:19.923 --> 21:22.568
it's going to affect our country, then we do not 
need it there.

21:26.311 --> 21:26.653
Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Paul. I really 
appreciate this. Thank you. That's okay.
