Debbie Parks interviewing Mr. Charles W. 
Crawford March 24, 1983 for the History of College

00:03.592 --> 00:17.387
Station Project at Mr. Crawford's house.

00:22.272 --> 00:26.857
Alright, I'd like to start with some background on 
yourself. Where were you born? I was born in

00:28.499 --> 00:31.804
Benchley, Texas, about ten miles north of 
Brownsville. Oh, that's right. I've seen it as

00:33.266 --> 00:35.449
I've driven. Well, are your parents from that same 
area? Well, my mother was a Brownsville County

00:38.934 --> 00:41.137
girl. My father was an M.D. At that time, he was 
practicing medicine in Wellborn, Texas. And he

00:50.230 --> 00:54.677
and my mother met, and they were married here in 
Brownsville County. And so your father was a

00:54.697 --> 00:56.800
doctor then? Yes. Well, I bet there weren't that 
many doctors in his time. Well, no, there weren't

01:01.162 --> 01:05.088
very many doctors at that time. He was a son of an old 
pioneer in Texas who came to Texas in 1833 and said

01:05.748 --> 01:25.455
he felt that he won his Texas citizenship by 
fighting in the Battle of Harrisburg and the

01:05.748 --> 01:25.455
Battle of San Jacinto. So your grandfather fought 
in the Texas Revolution? Yes, the Texas

01:30.788 --> 01:32.430
Revolution. Oh, that's wonderful. What kind of 
education did you receive? I went to country

01:39.176 --> 01:51.088
school in Harvey, Texas, and then I came into Bryan 
and went one year to Bryan Baptist Academy, and

01:39.176 --> 01:51.088
then I went Next year I went to Bryan High School and 
finished my high school diploma in Bryan. Then I

01:59.182 --> 02:10.954
came to Texas A&M and graduated from mechanical 
engineering in June 24, 1919. That was a class that

02:11.294 --> 02:15.218
almost wasn't. Because of the war? Because of the 
war. We started out with 600 students. in the

02:21.089 --> 02:24.913
freshman class and wound up with 57. Oh, no. Well, 
were you in World War I then? I was in the service a

02:30.220 --> 02:33.864
very short time, about three months. Okay, after 
you got your bachelor's, then you must have gone on

02:35.786 --> 02:41.933
and... I did. I went on and got my master's degree. 
In the fall of 1919, I had gone to work for during the

02:50.958 --> 02:53.581
summer for the city of Port Arthur. And I worked as 
an instrument man setting levels on some drainage

02:54.563 --> 03:03.955
project down in Port Arthur. And in the fall, 
Professor Fermier, head of Mechanical

03:04.816 --> 03:12.425
Engineering Department, wired and offered me a 
job. And since my mother and there were two younger

03:13.527 --> 03:19.935
children still in Bryan, And I felt that they 
needed me. I accepted the job as an instructor at

03:24.001 --> 03:33.514
Texas A&M, but really didn't expect to stay here 
more than a year or two. But it turned out to be 46

03:34.855 --> 03:36.938
years. Well, can you tell me how it developed, what 
you became later in the department? My whole

03:45.029 --> 03:47.672
career more or less happened. It wasn't planned. I 
came back to A&M, started teaching, and I found

03:49.632 --> 03:54.859
that I liked teaching. And the first sommelier 
seemed to like me and think that I was doing a good

03:55.440 --> 04:00.226
job. And so I continued to teach, and I gradually 
did graduate work while I was teaching. It was

04:10.079 --> 04:15.707
about 1929, though, before I actually finished my 
master's degree. But later on, you became the head

04:17.003 --> 04:20.687
of the department. Well, as the years went along, I 
was advanced from assistant professor,

04:23.190 --> 04:32.620
associate professor, and then professor. And in 
the fall of 1919, no, I take you back. I didn't mean

04:40.709 --> 04:42.031
the fall of 1919. Fall of 1927, Professor Cramier 
died. long about, I believe it was the 27th of

04:47.159 --> 04:50.784
December. And I continued to teach, and a man by the 
name of Bliss, Professor W.D. Bliss, came in as

04:58.075 --> 05:01.420
head of the department. And he was a former 
professor at Lafayette, head of the mechanical

05:02.241 --> 05:13.217
and chemical engineering department at 
Lafayette.

05:16.133 --> 05:23.242
I

05:16.133 --> 05:23.242
can't think of the name of the school now. Not 
Lafayette. Is it Tulane? No, it was up in Indiana.

05:30.691 --> 05:33.154
Oh, it's Indiana. But anyway, he had business 
interests and the Depression came on and he felt

05:33.174 --> 05:42.846
that he had to go back to his business up there. And 
so when he left, why? I was made head of the

05:46.340 --> 05:49.784
department. Is that 1929? 1929. And how long were 
you head of the department? Until 1957. 1957. No,

05:57.813 --> 06:01.698
yes, I believe that's right. And then in 1957, I was 
made associate dean and remained in that position

06:01.718 --> 06:11.149
until 1962. In 1962, I had reached the age of 65 and 
they sent me back to the department and I taught

06:16.259 --> 06:33.416
three more years I believe and finally retired in 
1965.

06:36.139 --> 06:44.207
Well I was reading in your book about the early 
history of the A&M College and can you tell me about

06:45.149 --> 06:52.460
Who owned the land that the college was 
established on and how the college came to be

06:45.149 --> 06:52.460
located where it is? One of the chief men who 
influenced the location of A&M where it is today

06:53.201 --> 07:01.673
was named Harvey Mitchell. And Harvey Mitchell 
was an old pioneer in this area and he owned a part of

07:02.995 --> 07:15.072
this land, but a Mrs. Rector owned part of it and one 
or two other people. But Harvey Mitchell was

07:16.115 --> 07:31.013
instrumental in getting the titles and 
purchasing the land to donate to A&M for its

07:16.115 --> 07:31.013
establishment. So he donated the land to the ? 
Well, the people that

07:34.437 --> 07:45.430
gave the land, I'm not sure it was entirely a 
donation, but I think it was. And there

07:45.983 --> 07:52.472
was three different plots of land. I think he owned 
one. Ms. Rector owned one. I don't remember who

07:55.897 --> 07:58.240
owned the other. But between those three, they 
gave the major portion of the land for A&M. Did

08:04.669 --> 08:06.752
these people live in Bryan? Live in Bryan, yes. At 
this time, College Station was five miles out in

08:08.415 --> 08:15.805
the country, just out in the bleak open wilds. no 
houses around in this area at all. It wasn't

08:20.421 --> 08:22.463
anything, is that right? No, plain open land. 
Okay, so when A&M was established and you had the

08:24.466 --> 08:36.601
land around the college that later becomes 
College Station, was it still just open land? What

08:36.841 --> 08:38.623
was there, if anything? It was nothing here, but 
the commission that was appointed by The

08:46.126 --> 09:05.511
governor, after the legislature had passed the 
bill creating A&M, was made up of three men, and

08:46.126 --> 09:05.511
they came over and surveyed the land, looked it 
over, and I understand that the local citizens

08:46.126 --> 09:05.511
gave them quite a big party. Oh, really? And they 
established A&M, or rather chose a site for it, and

09:07.193 --> 09:15.103
then They were allowed such a very little time by 
the legislature under the laws to choose a

09:15.691 --> 09:28.809
location and employ an architect to plan the 
buildings. And then they were supposed to

09:28.829 --> 09:37.722
get the buildings built and started within 90 
days. It was actually about three years before it

09:38.443 --> 09:41.627
actually happened that way. Well, those things 
don't happen fast. No, they sure don't. So when the

09:45.492 --> 09:51.522
A&M wasn't established, then this land was fields 
and prairies. Was it used for farmland? It was open

09:54.707 --> 09:55.909
range. It was just open farmland. Were you aware of 
any Czech settlement in this area? I find a lot of

10:03.000 --> 10:07.387
Czechoslovakian names in this area. No. I don't 
think there was any actual settlement. group of

10:12.121 --> 10:18.627
people living around within any closer than 
Bryan, which was nearly five miles away.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.434
Did you live on campus housing? I'm aware that the 
campus had housing for professors. Did you live in

10:30.439 --> 10:32.381
that housing? I lived on the campus several years. 
The house that I lived in originally was up across

10:41.197 --> 11:01.424
the street from the post office and then it was 
moved down in the what we called the pecan orchard

10:41.197 --> 11:01.424
at that time and the pecan orchard was right next to 
the ASC building which is on the corner of the

10:41.197 --> 11:01.424
campus near the railroad at the present time. The 
ASC building? It was Agricultural Stabilization

11:04.737 --> 11:08.261
and Conservation. They've changed the name of it a 
time or two, but I don't know exactly what the

11:08.421 --> 11:14.327
present name is. So the house you lived in was moved 
to the Pecan? Pecan Orchard, yeah. And was that

11:19.813 --> 11:21.776
considered off campus? No, it was on the campus, 
still on the campus. Well, about how many houses

11:25.339 --> 11:31.386
were on campus for professors?

11:32.497 --> 11:44.994
It'd be a guess if I were to say 25 would be, I don't 
know, that wouldn't be accurate at all, but that's

11:32.497 --> 11:44.994
about what I... Well, just a round figure is what I 
would say. Well, did certain houses, like only

11:45.014 --> 11:51.684
professors rent certain houses? Well, they were 
somewhat on the basis of seniority. They had the

11:56.471 --> 12:01.137
houses for the presidents, which was built for 
L.S. Ross when he was president of A&M. And then

12:07.827 --> 12:18.357
they had the houses for the deans and had houses for 
the full professors and the heads of departments.

12:18.377 --> 12:23.682
And that was more or less when you became eligible 
for one. The rents were very nominal. Oh, so it

12:26.685 --> 12:27.266
was... Very nominal. I think I paid $15 to $20 a 
month for the house that I lived in. I wish I could

12:35.109 --> 12:37.993
pay that. So basically, around A&M, the community 
in its early days... There was no community around

12:43.781 --> 12:47.947
A&M for many years. It was on campus. It was on the 
campus. Well, could the university provide all

12:50.490 --> 12:56.338
your needs, such as the utilities and the water and 
the sewer? They provided, yes, the electricity.

12:59.740 --> 13:02.744
and the water and the sewer service.

13:07.211 --> 13:12.058
Could you describe the roads or the 
transportation system around A&M? Well the road

13:12.118 --> 13:16.545
coming from Bryan was considered a pretty good 
road. It was gravel and it wound out from Bryan and

13:16.585 --> 13:28.903
came up by the F&B

13:16.585 --> 13:28.903
station near the northwest corner area and then 
came on down what's now known as Wellborn Road into

13:29.508 --> 13:38.739
College Station. That was a gravel road and 
considered a pretty fair road at that time. So the

13:45.547 --> 13:50.012
only road to Bryan was where the Wellborn Highway 
is now? That's right. It's along by the railroad

13:51.113 --> 13:58.722
until it got up to the F&B Station and then veered 
off into the road that now leads into Bryan. Is that

14:01.923 --> 14:03.725
South College? Are you talking about South 
College? Yes, South College Avenue. Okay. What

14:08.451 --> 14:11.835
was Jersey or Texas 6 like? Was it just a... What was 
what? Jersey, you know where Jersey Street is?

14:16.581 --> 14:18.664
Yes, that was one of the streets. When the campus 
began to build up, and that was in, along about

14:19.184 --> 14:25.232
19... the area south of the college began to build 
up, and Jersey Street was one of the new streets in

14:25.820 --> 14:37.733
that near addition. That addition was the first 
individual housing that was built around,

14:38.434 --> 14:49.386
adjacent to the campus. It happened in the south? 
Yes. Were there any houses in the north, around

14:51.308 --> 14:55.573
Northgate area? There were just a few houses that 
were up where we called the North Gate, and that's

14:56.549 --> 15:05.337
the present North Gate area.

15:08.940 --> 15:18.408
But there were very, I would say that there were not 
more than 10 or 12 houses, 15 houses in that whole

15:08.940 --> 15:18.408
area, north campus. What was Highway 6, our 
present Texas Avenue, what was that like? Highway

15:25.321 --> 15:28.204
6 didn't come in for a good many years later. See, 
that was the backside of the campus. Oh, it's the

15:32.208 --> 15:38.635
main entrance now. Yes, but

15:38.655 --> 15:53.910
the main entrance to the campus was down at the 
railroad station, and there were two railroad

15:38.655 --> 15:53.910
stations, one for the H&TC Railroad, Southern 
Pacific, and the other for INGN.

16:04.971 --> 16:09.256
And that was considered the front of the campus. 
And from where the present administration

16:09.276 --> 16:21.552
building, system administration building, out 
to the present Highway 6 was just all pasture. That

16:22.139 --> 16:24.181
was considered the back pasture.

16:27.564 --> 16:48.103
There was a road leading up from the northwest side 
of the campus, which is now, I believe, University

16:27.564 --> 16:48.103
Avenue, goes out by the north gate and went down out 
to the present Highway 6. And that Highway 6 was

16:48.764 --> 16:51.927
just a dirt road And that was called Sulphur 
Springs Road.

16:57.488 --> 16:59.591
The one that is University today? Yeah.

17:02.777 --> 17:04.319
Is Sulphur Springs? Yes. And was it just a dirt 
road? Or was Texas City? The road came out from

17:08.506 --> 17:15.518
Bryan, out that way, and led on down. to the south 
and west parallel pretty well where the present

17:16.426 --> 17:25.939
Highway 6 goes out to the Rock Prairie area. And 
then Sulphur Springs Road veered off left and went

17:27.120 --> 17:36.393
down into the Navasad Bottom and went to Sulphur 
Springs. That was just a dirt road.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.162
I'm not sure where Sulphur Springs is. Where is 
that? Is it closer to Bryan or headed out? I believe

17:46.619 --> 18:09.012
at the present time the old Sulphur Springs Road 
is,

17:46.619 --> 18:09.012
I can't think of the street now, I can't think of the 
street, the name, it's between here and Bryan. I

18:09.363 --> 18:11.787
believe it's still called Sulphur Springs Road. 
Uh-huh, there is one. So this street veered off to

18:12.989 --> 18:15.212
that area. Well, it paralleled President 
Highway, uh, Railroad, uh, President Railroad,

18:15.232 --> 18:36.906
but it was about a mile further northeast than the 
President from the, well, at that time that was

18:15.232 --> 18:36.906
Sulphur Springs Road, which led down into the 
country area out in the south, southeast corner of

18:37.915 --> 18:41.980
the present campus. And the present Texas 6 was 
just a dirt road, if anything. Yes. That road went

18:47.326 --> 19:06.167
on down to Wellborn and went on down to Navasota and 
went through the Brazos Bottom area and came into

18:47.326 --> 19:06.167
Navasota about a mile this side of Navasota, which 
turned

19:06.721 --> 19:12.966
left when you're going down and went across the 
Navasota River Bridge. That's the present

19:14.308 --> 19:19.072
Navasota River Bridge, which crossed over the 
railroad. Oh, I see. Highway 6 was finally

19:22.335 --> 19:34.846
continued on up to College Station after that 
former road was still, I think, still used but was

19:22.335 --> 19:34.846
practically abandoned. Oh, is that right? Do you 
remember the trolley line? Oh yes, I rode that

19:38.060 --> 19:41.102
trolley many times. Where did that run? How was 
that? It came right through my house here. Oh, did

19:45.466 --> 19:47.248
it? Actually, it came out from Ryan to what's 
called Hillcrest. And then Hillcrest, the

19:54.614 --> 20:04.943
trolley came on down and crossed this little 
branch out here. just where it became Cabot

20:05.952 --> 20:10.717
Avenue. And you see, when it got to this point, to 
the point right down, just at the present time,

20:12.239 --> 20:35.925
it's just this side of that Catholic corner, and 
crossed the branch, and came right over here, and

20:12.239 --> 20:35.925
went into the campus right in from here about about 
where Nagel is at the present time. The street

20:40.410 --> 20:42.453
Nagel is. Actually, it went into campus a little 
bit further west than that. Well, when did they

20:47.282 --> 20:51.049
stop using the trolley? I don't remember the date, 
but it was,

20:51.069 --> 21:00.225
I expect it must have been

21:08.491 --> 21:11.274
I can remember when I wrote it in 1930. Oh, that 
late?

21:21.246 --> 21:21.686
Excuse me. Were you living in a campus house when 
the board of directors ordered people to move off

21:21.907 --> 21:38.346
campus, ordered

21:21.907 --> 21:38.346
people to find houses in the area surrounding A&M? 
I believe I was. What did you do? Did you buy one of

21:43.806 --> 21:46.970
the houses and move it? To

21:46.990 --> 21:55.541
tell you the truth, I can't quite recall when that 
was. Oh yes, I moved to Bryan. I moved to Bryan after

22:02.389 --> 22:09.598
I got married, which was about 1926. Then in 26, I 
lived in that location until I

22:10.085 --> 22:26.464
was made head of department. That's when I moved to 
campus. And

22:29.788 --> 22:37.797
I simply can't recall when I moved off the campus. 
Oh yes, I did. I moved to another house on the

22:42.549 --> 22:53.383
campus, which was down by the old swimming pool, 
and lived in that house for several years. And then

22:54.324 --> 23:07.902
about 19...

22:54.324 --> 23:07.902
Can't seem to get my dates very clear in there. 
moved off the campus and lived off the campus a year

23:08.557 --> 23:16.767
before I built a house up on the hill in front of 
College Station. That big two-story house up on

23:17.147 --> 23:21.953
the hill there was my home where I built it. In which 
area though? It's right out in front of the campus,

23:23.996 --> 23:29.943
about half a mile off the campus, up on the hill. 
It's on, is it at Eastgate? Across Highway 6. Oh,

23:32.125 --> 23:33.066
it's at Eastgate. Yeah, Eastgate. And I built that 
house in 19...

23:41.227 --> 23:46.172
I believe it was 40, a year after I moved off campus. 
Was that in College Hills Estate that you built

23:46.673 --> 23:49.475
your house? Well, it was part of College Hills 
Estate, yes. I believe that's what they called it.

23:56.242 --> 24:01.768
Okay, do you remember the public school system 
that was on campus for a while? Do you remember that

24:01.788 --> 24:02.789
at all? Yes, I remember the building. It was a 
stucco, two-story stucco building over in the

24:04.250 --> 24:10.677
area where the core area now is. It's really not 
quite, it's almost where the road, the street

24:13.561 --> 24:34.890
coming down by the MSC now makes that bend right at 
the area that houses the core. And that's where the

24:34.910 --> 24:35.471
school? Yes, that's where the school building 
was. Did any professors at A&M volunteer their

24:39.158 --> 24:43.282
time and teach there? I think maybe that there was a 
little bit of that, but Mr. George Wilcox was

24:43.863 --> 24:52.111
superintendent of that school and was a good one 
too. And they had a real good school for the time and

24:52.691 --> 25:01.280
they had full-time teachers. I don't remember. I 
remember the names of one or two, but Mr. Wilcox I

25:06.648 --> 25:11.794
remember very distinctly because he's such a fine 
person. Is he dead now? Yes, he's been dead a good

25:12.775 --> 25:14.598
many years. When your children went to school, did 
they go to the one that was on Jersey Street or did

25:15.799 --> 25:22.447
they go on campus? I had one daughter and

25:22.467 --> 25:34.562
she was born while we were living on the campus and

25:37.715 --> 26:06.777
While we were living on the campus, she grew up to 
enter school, but by that time they had organized

25:37.715 --> 26:06.777
President

25:37.715 --> 26:06.777
College Station School, Independent School 
District, and she went to that school for one or two

25:37.715 --> 26:06.777
years, and then she went to Bryan for several 
years, and finally, while we were living up on the

26:07.617 --> 26:15.910
hill, why she went to Bryan and graduated from 
Bryan High School. Is there any reason why she went

26:15.930 --> 26:20.177
to Bryan rather than the College Station School? I 
don't really remember any. We felt like that Bryan

26:23.202 --> 26:30.213
was an older school system and better 
established. I guess I had gone there. That might

26:32.277 --> 26:34.941
have influenced me some.

26:38.144 --> 26:46.975
Can you remember what, before it became a city in 
the 30s and the 40s, can you remember what College

26:38.144 --> 26:46.975
Station looked like physically? Any commercial 
developments?

26:51.842 --> 26:54.345
There were very little commercial developments. 
There was one or two stores at the north gate and

26:54.365 --> 27:07.442
there wasn't anything on the east gate and there 
was little development. that was built across

27:08.384 --> 27:38.273
from the campus on the southwest corner of the 
campus, south corner, you might say, of the

27:08.384 --> 27:38.273
campus, there were about 10 or 12 of those project 
houses, which were two-story wooden frame

27:08.384 --> 27:38.273
buildings in which the men were allowed to live and 
they brought most of their food from the farms And

27:38.607 --> 27:44.956
they had those, some of them had cows, brought cows 
and chickens. And Dan Russell was the man who was

27:45.457 --> 27:51.625
the head of the project houses. He was a graduate of 
Baylor University and was down here for many years

27:52.387 --> 28:00.518
as head of rural sociology department. And there 
was a small community area built up right along in

28:05.641 --> 28:18.039
there in the early 30s, which was just south of the 
campus, which was along where there was one or two

28:05.641 --> 28:18.039
stores, one or two filling stations. This 
happened because of the project housing? Well,

28:20.924 --> 28:24.349
this was just off the campus. The project houses 
were on the campus. Oh, I see. Okay. The American

28:27.874 --> 28:35.445
Legion built a little housing, well, built a 
two-story building in there I believe it was two

28:35.746 --> 28:37.668
story, I'm not sure of that. But anyway, the 
American Legion sponsored that and built that

28:38.409 --> 28:52.746
house to help the students who were members of the,

28:38.409 --> 28:52.746
what? American Legion? No, it wasn't the American 
Legion. It was, I can't think of the name of it,

28:58.653 --> 29:05.601
connected with Masonic Lodge. Not the Masons? 
Yeah. I don't remember the name of the

29:09.876 --> 29:18.089
organization, but they built the houses because 
housing was so badly needed. These were for

29:18.750 --> 29:20.993
students, right? Yes, they were for students. And 
you said to, that's on the southwest corner of

29:22.856 --> 29:26.542
campus? Yes. And then you said off of campus in the 
south, a rural community? That was across the

29:30.889 --> 29:32.432
present highway. Oh. Well, the Welburn Road runs 
parallel to the railroad. This is at right angles,

29:39.901 --> 29:45.648
crosses just beyond the campus, now goes out to the 
airport. Okay. That's the main road that goes from

29:48.152 --> 29:58.125
the President, Texas Avenue, right across the 
edge of the campus and goes on out to the airport. It

29:58.746 --> 30:03.432
was just across the road there that had this little 
commercial development. Okay. I would like to

30:08.868 --> 30:13.234
talk about the incorporation of College Station, 
if you remember that. Do you remember when it was

30:15.557 --> 30:32.322
incorporated in 39 and... Well, a real good friend 
of mine, professor of mathematics, Dr. John

30:15.557 --> 30:32.322
Binney, was, I believe, the first mayor of College 
Station and he was mayor for several years until

30:33.415 --> 30:46.593
Professor Ernest Langford became mayor and after 
he became mayor he was mayor for about 20 years.

30:47.814 --> 30:48.215
That's right. And he taught me when I was a freshman 
at A&M. Mr. Langford did? Mr. Langford did. He was a

30:55.625 --> 30:57.347
very good friend of mine. Well, do you remember any 
of the reasons why the communities around A&M

30:57.817 --> 31:05.589
campus wanted to incorporate into a town? At that 
time, the Bryan City Council decided that it was

31:05.609 --> 31:17.566
about time for them to incorporate and include 
College Station. And the people who were at

31:18.207 --> 31:23.976
College Station didn't want to be incorporated in 
Bryan. So they got together and organized the city

31:24.293 --> 31:30.800
of College Station to keep from being included in 
Bryan. Why didn't they want to be included in

31:30.820 --> 31:33.703
Bryan? They just wanted to be independent. You 
kind of had a community around the college? At that

31:41.491 --> 31:45.736
time, there were very few houses between Bryan and 
College Station. Along the highway, there were

31:46.337 --> 31:50.841
just a few farmhouses. I bet there weren't were the 
dozen houses between here and the settlements of

31:53.133 --> 31:58.139
Bryan at that time. And so they wanted to remain 
independent.

32:03.386 --> 32:04.287
How did you feel? Do you remember having any 
feelings one way or the other about College

32:04.307 --> 32:09.354
Station being incorporated? Well, since I was 
living in Bryan and had lived in Bryan, I felt like

32:09.374 --> 32:19.247
it wouldn't be bad for Bryan to go ahead and 
incorporate College Station. But a good many of my

32:19.267 --> 32:20.929
friends who had never lived in Bryan, didn't feel 
that way. But there's advantages to being

32:24.313 --> 32:28.596
incorporated into an older town. I felt like there 
were some, especially the school system. Plus

32:34.381 --> 32:37.344
your services and utilities. Yeah. At that time, 
Bryan City Power Plant supplied the electricity

32:38.325 --> 32:48.353
for A&M, except for what was on the campus. A&M had 
its own power plant. But the city of College

32:50.508 --> 32:57.054
Station, which grew up around here, was served by 
Bryan. Oh. The power plant. Through, I think, REA

32:59.096 --> 33:02.480
lines. No, at that time it was head of REA. REA 
hadn't come in at that time. Oh, OK. So houses

33:09.927 --> 33:13.571
around were serviced by Bryan. Yeah. They had an 
agreement with Bryan. Brian and them that if one

33:19.820 --> 33:33.520
had trouble that other ones could tie into the same 
system so they were could be connected in the case

33:19.820 --> 33:33.520
of emergency.

33:36.264 --> 33:48.882
Do you remember like any publicizing meetings for 
incorporation or people who were active and well

33:36.264 --> 33:48.882
of course these are faculty members who would be 
active and pushing for Well, most of the men who

33:49.537 --> 34:06.840
were active were members of the A&M faculty, like 
Dr. Benny and Mr. Lankford and

33:49.537 --> 34:06.840
Mr. Boyd. Orrin Boyd, I believe, was not Orrin, but 
one of the Boyd men. But other members of the

34:13.910 --> 34:19.037
community Part of them were members of the faculty 
and part of them were one or two businessmen. That

34:26.975 --> 34:28.117
were interesting. Do you remember Mr., or maybe 
the doctor, McNew? Very well. McNew and I were good

34:36.147 --> 34:37.829
friends. He, according to newspaper accounts, 
was very interested in seeing the college

34:38.470 --> 34:44.418
incorporated. Yes. He did some engineering work 
for the the city of College Station. I don't

34:52.364 --> 35:00.433
remember whether he was city engineer or not, but 
he had quite a bit of influence in that group.

35:00.453 --> 35:02.015
Worked with them pretty closely. Do you remember 
attending any meetings that talked about the pros

35:02.776 --> 35:07.682
and cons? No, I actually don't. I don't recall a 
thing in which I was involved.

35:15.430 --> 35:19.357
Do you remember them, do you even recall them being 
held on campus? I was wondering where they were

35:19.658 --> 35:21.261
held. The meeting? Uh-huh. To talk about 
incorporation? I really don't know. You don't

35:28.714 --> 35:29.535
know. Okay. Do you happen to know how the board of 
directors felt about College Station

35:31.158 --> 35:37.590
incorporating the name? agree or i think don't 
think there was any strong feeling but i think they

35:38.363 --> 36:07.341
agreed to it and felt maybe it would be to the best 
interest of the university for the college for

35:38.363 --> 36:07.341
them to be incorporated okay

35:38.363 --> 36:07.341
um i think we have a few minutes on this side excuse 
me i think i served only two years or maybe four

36:08.131 --> 36:37.058
years but at that time four years at that time why

36:08.131 --> 36:37.058
Mr. Ewing Brown was a member of the council and Mr. 
Lloyd Smith a real good friend of mine was city

36:08.131 --> 36:37.058
manager and he had worked at the building and 
college utilities for many years before he became

36:38.101 --> 36:43.606
the city manager of College Station. At that time, 
the entire staff of the city of College Station

36:44.167 --> 36:59.441
consisted of Lloyd Smith, the city manager, and I 
believe one or two secretaries, and that was the

36:44.167 --> 36:59.441
whole group. And practically none of these

36:59.461 --> 37:07.028
streets around College Station paved at that 
time. And they did some paving or black-topping,

37:09.682 --> 37:26.327
which was very thin coating of gravel and asphalt, 
but it did cut down on the dust and made pretty fast

37:09.682 --> 37:26.327
streets for College Station. But at that time, 
they got out and graded the streets, put the

37:26.367 --> 37:37.183
asphalt on it, spread the gravel, and had very 
little actual permanent construction, very

37:37.552 --> 37:49.546
light coating of topping. OK. In 1943 is when you 
became elected. Why did you decide to run for

37:56.094 --> 37:57.896
office?

38:01.861 --> 38:07.187
It seemed like at about that time that there was a 
change made And I guess it was because I was pretty

38:07.522 --> 38:17.274
closely associated with Lloyd Smith and some of 
the men on the council, like Ernest Lankford. And

38:18.296 --> 38:21.560
they were all good friends of mine. It seemed at 
that time there just was an opening that I felt like

38:21.580 --> 38:27.367
I could fill. And what ward did you represent? I 
don't think we worked by wards at that time. I think

38:33.575 --> 38:35.217
it was all just one group. Mr. Langford was 
chairman, was the button mayor. Lloyd Smith was

38:39.307 --> 38:44.251
the

38:39.307 --> 38:44.251
city manager. Mr. Ewing Brown was, I believe he was 
a chemist, I'm not sure, on the campus. And

38:52.318 --> 38:53.840
Reverend R.L. Brown, who was the Baptist 
minister. And there was one or two more men on that,

38:57.503 --> 39:01.646
but I've forgotten who they were. Where did y'all 
meet and when? At

39:05.909 --> 39:20.141
that time, they had just built that little 
building down next to the railroad, and we met

39:05.909 --> 39:20.141
there in that building. And what nights? Do you 
remember? No, I don't remember. Did you meet once a

39:24.926 --> 39:27.788
month or more often? I think we met more often than 
that because we were more or less planning things

39:28.469 --> 39:35.815
that We're very informal about it. I don't imagine 
we kept a very complete set of minutes even. It was

39:43.270 --> 39:54.265
very informal and just a matter of getting 
together and discussing our problems and

39:43.270 --> 39:54.265
deciding on what we'd better do, but it was very 
informal. Very informal?

39:57.950 --> 40:00.194
Yeah, very. Did many citizens attend the 
meetings? Did they come and talk about what they

40:02.076 --> 40:05.481
needed done? I don't remember a single case in 
which any committee or group waited on us and

40:06.608 --> 40:19.885
wanted to have a presented problem. Really? So 
basically it was just the councilmen getting

40:21.126 --> 40:26.193
together and talking about what should be done? 
That's right, as I remember it. Okay. At this

40:29.513 --> 40:36.826
point, do you remember how closely associated the 
council was to operations at A&M? Did they confer a

40:36.846 --> 40:40.071
lot with the board of directors? Very little. I 
think that they knew what was going on, kept up with

40:42.275 --> 40:54.115
what was going on, but as far as the board of 
directors were concerned, there was very little

40:54.449 --> 41:00.034
participation in any way with the College Station 
City Council. Did College Station want to be able

41:00.054 --> 41:06.980
to be a city on its own and not depend on A&M? Yes. I 
think they felt that after the city was organized

41:09.242 --> 41:23.055
that they could go right ahead and operate 
independently of the College Station Board of

41:09.242 --> 41:23.055
Directors, A&M College Board of Directors. But 
were the relationship pretty amiable, though?

41:27.820 --> 41:28.702
Very amiable. We seemed to have complete 
cooperation between the staff and the board of

41:29.503 --> 41:38.720
directors and the city council. After all, nearly 
all those people were members of the A&M faculty.
