WEBVTT

00:06.781 --> 00:24.281
And people around there, I'm sure that

00:06.781 --> 00:24.281
there were people in there that, there were 
students in there, boys, that had nothing at all.

00:24.561 --> 00:26.924
And they got jobs. You could get a job with 
families. They needed help. Students would come

00:34.388 --> 00:37.753
and work with them or something like that. And, of 
course, they worked all across the campus. Yeah,

00:41.758 --> 00:46.465
and student labor was common, very common. You had 
the professors and some of the personnel paid, but

00:48.067 --> 00:59.624
other than that, it was always student labor. And 
you got 25 cents an hour. Now, when did you start

01:02.890 --> 01:06.254
doing chores for pay?

01:13.502 --> 01:14.062
Right away. I laid 6,000 feet of

01:15.644 --> 01:28.678
six-inch cast iron water mains in College Park. I 
had a hundred niggers working for me. My, my, my.

01:34.631 --> 01:36.033
How old were you then, probably? High school? No. 
High school, I was in grade school. My, my, my. I was

01:44.205 --> 01:45.847
a young kid. I was just a kid. Now, your dad was a part 
of the group. Yeah, the college park was founded by

01:51.956 --> 01:58.446
Dan Scholes. uh, Dr., uh, uh,

01:59.557 --> 02:16.779
well, let's see, Dan Scrooge, and then there was, 
uh, when he was in the economics, Dr. Clark. He was a

02:17.800 --> 02:19.623
crazy man. He was odd. Uh, he was in the economics 
department, and his idea was that, uh, On an

02:30.421 --> 02:46.315
automobile, when your repair bills got beyond 
what it cost to get a new one, your payments on a new

02:30.421 --> 02:46.315
one, you traded it off. You always drove an ethics 
car. Now, of the partners in the Southside, who put

02:52.340 --> 02:58.926
in the biggest investment? Who put the most money 
into it, do you know? I don't know. Or did they do it

03:04.466 --> 03:05.688
equally? They must have done it equally with the 
addition of the bank. I don't think there was any

03:13.618 --> 03:15.381
money put in it. Which bank underwrote it? I think 
at that time it must have been the

03:19.566 --> 03:27.737
First State and Trust Fund. Okay, from downtown 
Bryan. And

03:30.462 --> 03:37.572
about how many acres of land did they develop? It's 
about a hundred. And who'd they get the land, who'd

03:40.115 --> 03:42.258
they buy it from? Hard liquor. And it was called the 
Southside Development Company. The man that,

03:51.170 --> 03:56.277
okay, let's count them all. There was Burchard.

04:04.398 --> 04:07.182
house is still on Dexter. He took care of all the 
books. He was a,

04:10.346 --> 04:18.558
he worked for the state. You were saying Burchard? 
Burchard. The same one who worked for FAPS. He was a

04:23.685 --> 04:25.547
state chemist of some sort. And so they were there 
and they kept good books on the thing. Then there

04:31.496 --> 04:32.397
was a a fellow named Doherty and he just had one 
house there and then there was Lancaster well that

04:33.068 --> 05:01.540
was their father and their grandfather their 
grandfather was the one that I had contact with he

04:33.068 --> 05:01.540
taught me he was an old carpenter and he years and 
years many hours I spent in there he was showing me

04:33.068 --> 05:01.540
how to to handle tools and carpentry. And then 
there was Dr. Clark, and there was Dad. That was the

05:09.671 --> 05:11.293
whole thing of it. And that's 1920? 1920. That's 
what surprised me. I was looking at it not too long

05:20.061 --> 05:24.825
ago, and it surprised me. I thought it was later 
than that. And what they did, right down Dexter,

05:32.570 --> 05:34.352
You can just see them. Each of them was granted two 
lots.

05:42.221 --> 05:43.662
And the first one is Butchard. The next one is 
Dougherty. And the next one is Lancaster. And then

05:52.452 --> 06:01.041
Dad said, and

05:52.452 --> 06:01.041
Dr. Then it was Dr. Clark. He said, I want one lot 
here, but I want one lot down here. And Dad said, I

06:11.127 --> 06:18.677
want both of my lots together. Because when I meet 
my wife, I don't want nobody

06:20.420 --> 06:29.272
to know about it. So that was the setup. And I think 
they just gave those lots to him. Now, the land went

06:33.440 --> 06:38.305
along Jersey from Dexter to what street? What were 
the boundaries?

06:46.452 --> 06:55.421
The

06:46.452 --> 06:55.421
boundary on the east side is where the church is 
now. Where the Episcopal Church? Yeah. They're in

06:58.312 --> 07:01.836
South. Some of that property is in South. Some of it 
is in College Park and some of it is in

07:04.078 --> 07:10.705
Southoverwood. And then on the west side is up 
there where the Former Students Association is.

07:19.094 --> 07:21.497
That's the west end of it. And it went straight back 
and they had originally it had a the south corner

07:28.602 --> 07:57.597
the south corner down there had the lots were laid 
out for niggers there were niggers now were there

07:28.602 --> 07:57.597
any houses east of Southside Park no not for a long 
time that's what I thought but people came in

07:28.602 --> 07:57.597
Herschel Burgess bought it from Shoots. Shoots, I 
think. And then he developed it? He developed it.

08:05.325 --> 08:08.791
He and his wife developed that. And that's what's 
called South Oakwood. That's the home of the

08:14.239 --> 08:17.523
United States. I was asking their son. I know him. 
He was in the American Legion when we were

08:21.189 --> 08:25.635
together. And... I knew him not too well, but there 
was a group of them. They had a whole family down

08:37.089 --> 08:47.524
there, but they moved off somewhere else, and 
Schubert told me that they had a place over north of

08:37.089 --> 08:47.524
my place. Now,

08:47.544 --> 08:54.393
the son is still alive. He was in World War II. 
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. He was the one I was telling you got

08:58.158 --> 09:00.201
his arm hurt. Now did, when those new houses were 
built over there, did that change the life of this

09:00.942 --> 09:12.681
faculty family? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. But you still 
came on the campus to play with your buddies? Not

09:20.393 --> 09:21.415
really. Really? So you played... By that time I was 
going to school. Oh, okay. At that time, I was going

09:25.630 --> 09:32.018
to college or going to Bryan High School. All 
right. Now, when you went down to Bryan, somebody

09:32.839 --> 09:39.267
took you down there in a car? No, I drove. Oh, you 
drove. All right. 28 Hub Mobile. 28 Hub Mobile. All

09:48.639 --> 09:48.880
right. Okay. It was a sedan. Big old six-cylinder. 
Okay. And did anybody ride with you? About

09:57.730 --> 10:04.901
how many college kids went down to Bryan? So you 
were kind of by yourself? Did they tease you or

10:09.267 --> 10:11.671
anything about? No.

10:15.837 --> 10:21.405
I was so interested in the shop work they had. that 
it didn't really bother me because, oh, I made a lot

10:21.503 --> 10:36.801
of friends, old John M. Barron and the Barron's and 
his sister, the big old gal. Let's see, now the

10:36.821 --> 10:42.307
Brogdon girls, they're older than you are, Daisy 
and Eileen? Daisy worked for Dad. Okay. He came in

10:45.951 --> 10:50.937
after the Martins, see, We brought this other 
family with us when we came here, the Martin

10:51.575 --> 10:58.943
family, and she was dad's secretary. I see. And she 
had brought, that's an interesting story,

11:00.424 --> 11:15.920
because she must have come from south

11:00.424 --> 11:15.920
Mississippi. She met this English woman down in, 
ground and guff for it someplace and they married

11:20.819 --> 11:50.353
him but he couldn't read or write and she taught him 
to read and write and then the next thing she did she

11:20.819 --> 11:50.353
brought him to Starkville because at that time I 
don't know that an A&M had ever happened but in

11:20.819 --> 11:50.353
Mississippi it did happen they had sort of a lower 
grade school in the college.

11:57.689 --> 12:00.434
A demonstration school. No, it was just a regular 
old school. Well, but I mean it was a school for some

12:03.358 --> 12:12.873
of their education majors to get experience 
teaching and all? No, I don't think so. It was just

12:15.617 --> 12:16.559
playing. They knew they had to educate those 
people, and the college was appointed to do it. Oh,

12:24.284 --> 12:25.606
I see, okay. And so that's what, that's what, it was 
just straight, straight out. And so he got

12:30.554 --> 12:48.100
John Martin, Johnny, Johnny Martin, he got, he got 
his I think he was up, he was in college by the time we

12:49.615 --> 12:55.443
moved over here. But anyways, he and his wife and 
they had a little boy named John, too. And they came

13:03.715 --> 13:09.143
in that big old hub mobile that Daddy bought. And 
they lived in a building that's just south, north

13:09.584 --> 13:18.677
of the chemistry lab. building in there, I don't 
know what it was used for, but they broke it up into

13:19.079 --> 13:44.685
little apartments, and they lived in that, and she 
worked for Dad, and he built a barn in

13:19.079 --> 13:44.685
College Park before we built the house, and he was 
an Englishman. He would talk just like that, and so

13:44.725 --> 13:48.529
when When Dad went to Europe, he instructed Dad how 
to handle the

13:48.796 --> 14:08.203
people in buying stuff over there. And so then Dad 
brought back two or three

14:19.340 --> 14:37.184
During

14:19.340 --> 14:37.184
those years, who were your closest buddies in high 
school? Well, I used to play with all the Lucian

14:38.506 --> 14:49.060
Morgan and Charles Ritchie. See, Ritchie was

14:54.142 --> 14:59.608
Morgan. I don't remember what he did. But he had a 
house right where the Momoa Student Center is

15:02.291 --> 15:08.459
right now. And when you were in high school, if you 
and your buddies were going to have a good time, did

15:08.759 --> 15:17.429
you all ever go out on a Saturday night and have a 
good time? Where did you go? I bought a bottle of

15:19.870 --> 15:23.675
tea.

15:26.700 --> 15:27.741
And I fixed it up. And the only real thing that we 
could find was on each end of the administration

15:29.744 --> 15:48.131
building, you know, the administration, the 
white one, there's some parking lots there.

15:48.151 --> 15:48.291
Mm-hmm. And they were the only ones big enough. You 
take that Model T, and you just drive in there, and

15:52.087 --> 15:59.598
you kick that, just turn it as tight as you can. Then 
you grab ahold of the ears and pull them down. And

16:03.062 --> 16:04.384
you just sit there. And it'll just go round and 
round and round and round like everybody that you

16:04.404 --> 16:10.412
know.

16:14.297 --> 16:17.181
And I made a lot of friends with some of those. And

16:17.650 --> 16:25.822
where did you take a date in those days? Well, we 
took them to the dances at A&M. Here at A&M? How were

16:33.513 --> 16:40.603
the ladies treated at an A&M dance?

16:42.777 --> 16:45.200
Well, you could go up and tap something. No, I mean, 
were they treated nicely? Oh, yes. The boys

16:49.586 --> 16:52.270
behaved the way they... Oh, they were... Boys 
were... They were on their best behavior. They

16:55.294 --> 16:58.939
were not... And how did everybody dress? Oh, you 
had the best... You had your best... best clothes

16:58.959 --> 17:04.667
on. And the women had full dresses on. And the 
dances were held at Sabisa? Sabisa? Sabisa? What

17:11.515 --> 17:12.837
were the big dances? Which ones? The ring dance, 
which it still is. Do you remember going to the ring

17:17.342 --> 17:19.265
dance? Yeah. I imagine that's when, you know, 
that's just 30, I don't know, that was after that. I

17:30.239 --> 17:34.264
probably, I don't know how I took that ring dance. 
How much did your ring cost, do you remember? Well,

17:39.230 --> 17:41.353
the problem I had was that I was a small person. When 
I entered A&M, I only weighed 105 pounds.

17:53.077 --> 18:10.159
And so that big ring that they had, most of them 
wore, I just couldn't, it would just be like

17:53.077 --> 18:10.159
something heavy on my hand. And that year they came 
out with what they call, I don't know what they call

18:10.915 --> 18:19.465
it, a sweetheart ring, but it was a ring for your 
date. It was a woman's ring. But it was the same

18:23.130 --> 18:24.391
design? Exactly the same design. And I bought one 
of those. Put it on my finger and then it stayed

18:28.717 --> 18:33.563
there until my wife had to cut it off. Do you 
remember what it cost? Oh, it wasn't much money.

18:39.408 --> 18:42.753
How did you feel when you first put that Aggie ring 
on? Well, I was an Aggie long before that. That was

18:47.160 --> 18:51.225
just a culmination of everything. But you were 
proud. You were proud of it. You

18:54.250 --> 19:00.819
wouldn't do anything that didn't do it. In all of 
the years that you've worn an Aggie ring... Have

19:04.561 --> 19:06.725
you ever had any good ring stories? Did you lose it 
and somebody found it? No, we never did that. The

19:11.513 --> 19:15.760
only thing I had to do was have my wife read it all. 
Did you ever, were you ever in some place far, far

19:15.780 --> 19:21.389
away and somebody saw your Aggie ring? No, I don't 
think so. But...

19:31.122 --> 19:34.807
We were talking about A's all the time. Like one of 
my favorite ring stories, when I asked President

19:35.267 --> 19:50.667
Bowen for his ring story, he said that when he was a 
master's student at Caltech, he went to the

19:35.267 --> 19:50.667
University of Heidelberg for the summer in 
Germany. And he said he and two of his German

19:51.811 --> 20:01.745
graduate student buddies are on the train going 
over the Brenner Pass in northern Italy on their

19:51.811 --> 20:01.745
way to Venice. And they're over there having a good 
time. And he said this very well-dressed lady is

20:03.728 --> 20:06.472
reading a paper. She then lowers the paper and 
looks over it and suddenly says, oh, you're from

20:07.333 --> 20:12.220
Texas A&M? Well, yes, ma'am. How did you know? 
Well, I saw your ring. Well, how would you know an

20:16.446 --> 20:18.088
Aggie ring? Well, my husband is an Aggie. You might 
have heard of him. His name is H.B. Zachary. And he

20:24.821 --> 20:26.702
said he told her, yes, ma'am, I've heard of him.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.848
Well, I ran into Zachary. See, I was on the electric 
board for the city of Brown for nine years. See, the

20:40.975 --> 20:47.181
boys in the E department, they said, we want you on 
that board down there. That was after I came back

20:47.701 --> 20:50.805
from World War II. And so, uh, what happened was 
that, uh, it was Ward and, uh, what was the other

20:50.825 --> 21:01.659
guy's name?

21:01.679 --> 21:03.221
They wanted me on that board. And they got me on that 
board. And I stayed there a while. And then later

21:07.407 --> 21:14.736
on, uh, I ran it for, uh, nine years. And, uh, Of 
course, I came, I had worked for the REA prior to

21:18.110 --> 21:22.895
that. So I was well immersed in all that, what they 
were doing. And Brian was a part of the REA. They had

21:32.043 --> 21:36.828
a, what we call a Texas public. They had a REA. You 
had a Texas public or you'd have a co-op. They'd

21:45.076 --> 21:46.277
have a name. But that's the salvation of our... Oh, 
yes. You know why? Why? Because they amortize

21:55.567 --> 21:57.529
their loans. Those co-ops sitting out there, they 
don't have enough. The city of Bryan don't have a

22:02.574 --> 22:09.059
dime on those three big plants they got. They're 
paid for. That's 40% of your... See, in electric

22:11.762 --> 22:17.867
business, you got 40% for investments. You got 40% 
as an additional 40% for fuel. And 20% left for

22:30.168 --> 22:33.873
maintenance. So you take 40% out of there, you got 
yourself, and that's what I think the

22:33.893 --> 22:45.146
deregulation ought to be. And I hope the city of 
Bryan never does. You bet. Now you're A&M what

22:50.049 --> 22:52.433
class? What year? 35. 35. Did you know by chance 
when they were students, Earl Rudder or Tiger

22:55.877 --> 23:00.343
Teague? Did you know them as students? No, but when 
they were students, did you know them? Yes.

23:05.971 --> 23:07.173
Describe them as students. What were they like? 
Tiger Teague, he was always in business. As a

23:14.102 --> 23:14.703
student? Yeah. What kind of business? He took... 
He had

23:19.627 --> 23:35.226
a closet in the dormitory over there, and you just 
take your clothes to him, and he'd take them to the

23:19.627 --> 23:35.226
cleaner, bring them back, and you'd pay him. Now, 
he was a small man, wasn't he, as a student? And he's

23:41.133 --> 23:46.059
called Tiger because he was so energetic? No, I 
don't know anything about that. I don't know that,

23:50.170 --> 24:08.776
but I do know that one of the things that happened to 
him, it was really, he had

23:50.170 --> 24:08.776
over there, I don't know where it was exactly. It 
was somewhere in the Northgate area. He had a room

24:12.541 --> 24:18.169
over there, and he took a lot of the, the

24:19.583 --> 24:25.990
people that had disabilities. This was long 
before we even had anything. And

24:29.434 --> 24:37.544
so he brought them in there and he paid them a 
salary. Now it wasn't the salary that he had to pay

24:37.864 --> 24:48.156
for by the government.

24:51.241 --> 24:55.285
It was a good salary. And they were doing a lot of 
stuff. I don't know. I think they were taking some

24:59.329 --> 25:04.354
clothing and reworking it or something. It was a 
regular business. This is while he was a student?

25:08.198 --> 25:08.438
No. Oh, after. Immediately after. This would be 
about... In the late 30s? Yeah. What about Earl

25:18.468 --> 25:20.050
Rudder as a student? Oh, I'm sorry. And he had those 
people in there. And the wage and hour people came

25:28.752 --> 25:31.695
in there.

25:35.520 --> 25:42.289
And so they said, you've got to fire all those 
people because you can't pay them this wage. And he

25:43.590 --> 25:48.817
says, I'm not going to fire them. You go fire them. 
He made that man go down there and tell those people

25:51.367 --> 26:01.058
that they didn't have any job

25:51.367 --> 26:01.058
anymore. And that was the kind of man he was. But he 
was a Democrat, sold out completely to the

26:04.502 --> 26:13.433
Democrat party. And that's what bothered us. Earl 
Rudder, did you know Earl as a student? No, I never

26:23.180 --> 26:24.442
knew him as a student. The only time I knew very much 
about him was I got on an airplane with him one day.

26:30.151 --> 26:32.775
After World War II, after he's back here. Yeah, and 
he was president there. And we flew from here to, I

26:36.621 --> 26:42.069
think it was probably Kansas City. We sat there in 
the front, the last seat before you got to the

26:43.592 --> 26:48.880
front, you know. didn't have a seat in front of it. 
We sat there and talked. Back to your student days,

26:54.655 --> 27:00.361
you were not in the Corps as a senior, so you didn't 
have any senior boots. No, I got a pair, but they

27:01.803 --> 27:06.107
weren't any good. While you were an 
undergraduate, what were boys smoking in those

27:07.248 --> 27:13.595
days? They smoked just regular cigarettes. What 
kind? What brand? Campbell I never smoked. I

27:23.464 --> 27:39.511
smoked a little until I went to Ames and got that to

27:23.464 --> 27:39.511
get my master's degree and I had that stipend up 
there. And I didn't have enough money. And so I quit

27:44.227 --> 27:48.031
because I couldn't pay for the cigarettes. Back 
here when you were a student, were there many boys

27:49.413 --> 27:54.198
that smoked pipes or cigars? No, most of them were 
cigarettes. And did any of them roll their own? Not

28:00.965 --> 28:06.851
those people, but we were in contact with a lot of 
people. See, I traveled with Dad in the hardware

28:07.252 --> 28:12.057
association. And, well, we met everybody. So you 
saw people with Bull Durham and Prince Albert? Oh,

28:18.304 --> 28:19.305
yeah. What about snuff? Did Aggies dip snuff then? 
The Negro women dipped snuff. The Negro women,

28:25.134 --> 28:28.299
they dipped snuff like it always was. Did they put 
it in their lip or in their jaw? In the lip. It was

28:33.267 --> 28:33.948
always right here. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Now, my son, he 
got involved in it, and he got it in his jaw. Hmm. And

28:42.530 --> 28:45.554
we had a hell of a time with that. But what broke that 
up was that the, uh, he had, he had done, they had

28:46.935 --> 28:56.406
done some, what do you call it, orthotonic? Big 
burn? Uh, ortho, something for teeth.

29:05.137 --> 29:06.018
Orthodontist? Yeah. Mm-hmm. And they had done 
some work on his teeth. And the, uh, I said, I just

29:12.635 --> 29:18.304
told him that he had to stop because he would run his 
teeth. And so he quit cold turkey. Back to your A&M

29:24.754 --> 29:29.982
days, when you graduated, do you remember 
commencement? What was it like? What was the

29:31.524 --> 29:33.207
commencement ceremony like?

29:36.472 --> 29:37.714
I think it was...

29:43.195 --> 29:49.802
Was it in DeWare or Guyon Hall or out in the stadium? 
It was in the stadium. Well, it would be in probably

29:55.288 --> 30:02.656
Guyon Hall because there was only 300. 300 
graduated? Did every hand get shaken? Every name

30:06.421 --> 30:07.662
was called? Yes, it was. It went across the stage. 
Just like it is today. How did you feel when you got

30:13.636 --> 30:16.279
your diploma? Great.

30:19.802 --> 30:24.826
I had a job with the USDA at that time, but it didn't 
last. Did it not last because of the depression?

30:28.650 --> 30:30.451
No, because of health. I had appendicitis,

30:30.551 --> 30:36.637
for example. I worked three weeks on it. I was in in 
the conservation service. As you look back on your

30:46.122 --> 30:54.070
A&M undergraduate years, which teachers helped 
you the most? The ones that you feel most grateful

30:55.612 --> 31:01.178
for having had as your teachers? Well,

31:09.443 --> 31:14.228
Well, old Cubone Ritchie, he was a good teacher. He 
was a real good teacher. And what did he teach?

31:18.874 --> 31:22.418
Strength of Materials.

31:22.558 --> 31:24.500
OK. Who else? Oh,

31:26.022 --> 31:32.830
the guy in genetics. I enjoyed that. What was his 
name? Do you remember? I don't remember, but he had

31:37.878 --> 31:42.606
an aneurysm.
