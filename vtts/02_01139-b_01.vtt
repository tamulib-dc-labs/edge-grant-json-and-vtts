WEBVTT

00:01.195 --> 00:08.987
And this morning, we're going to have a very 
interesting and yet historical program as well.

00:09.548 --> 00:17.100
Our guest for the talk show on Wednesday, March the 
8th is Dr. Hugh M. Phillips, retired doctor of

00:09.548 --> 00:17.100
veterinary medicine. And Dr. Phillips, how are 
you this morning? Fine, Chipper. We appreciate

00:20.585 --> 00:25.880
you coming out, and we're going to be talking about 
the history of veterinary medicine in Texas.

00:25.940 --> 00:35.607
We're going to be talking about several things, as 
well as your career, not only here in Russ County,

00:25.940 --> 00:35.607
but before you moved to Russ County, which was back 
in the 40s, as I understand it. But to get things

00:35.587 --> 00:48.207
rolling, tell us first of all, you've prepared a 
paper and it was presented a week or so ago in

00:35.587 --> 00:48.207
Longview at an East Texas historical meeting. 
Tell us the purpose of the paper and why we're going

00:48.868 --> 00:55.017
into this history of veterinary medicine in 
Texas. What's the purpose of it? Well, Chipper,

00:57.541 --> 01:03.130
the first week that I retired in February of 1985, I 
went to Houston to the State Veterinary

01:03.667 --> 01:18.144
Convention and I was asked at that time if I would 
like to serve on the historical committee for the

01:03.667 --> 01:18.144
state association. And since that was my cup of 
tea, I accepted that assignment and have enjoyed

01:19.085 --> 01:26.614
working with that group. We meet twice a year. 
Every August we meet in Austin and then In the

01:33.046 --> 01:42.098
winter, we always attend the Texas Veterinary 
Medical Association convention and meet as a

01:33.046 --> 01:42.098
committee. Okay, now, from this, you and other 
colleagues, veterinarians, are going to be

01:43.860 --> 01:51.971
compiling a book, I understand it. That's right. 
What's it going to entail? Well, it will be

01:55.516 --> 01:59.361
entitled The History of Veterinary Medicine in 
Texas. We thought that At first we thought a catchy

02:01.970 --> 02:14.026
title might be proper, but we decided later that in 
the interest of communicating with people, we

02:01.970 --> 02:14.026
would call it The History of Veterinary Medicine 
in Texas. That's not going to be quite a clinical

02:14.747 --> 02:24.940
book, I hope, one that anyone that could read and 
understand the terms and understand what went on

02:14.747 --> 02:24.940
just sort of a historical basis. happening of how 
veterinary medicine got started in Texas? It has

02:29.725 --> 02:33.088
to be more than just dates and pictures. It will 
have some interesting stories in it and it will be

02:33.989 --> 02:38.154
readable. If it isn't, then of course it won't 
sell. And we want to sell books enough to pay for the

02:43.780 --> 02:47.484
printing. When do you expect the book to be 
completed? We have already hired an author last

02:51.128 --> 02:55.112
summer and he's working Of course, it will 
probably still be another year or two. Okay. But

03:01.570 --> 03:12.923
the preliminary work has begun, and you, along 
with the other veterinarians of Texas, are doing

03:01.570 --> 03:12.923
research and talking and compiling this 
information, I guess, aren't you? Right. Well,

03:13.845 --> 03:15.386
let's just kind of get started. Before we do, just a 
brief... We're going to be going into your... that

03:21.518 --> 03:24.102
you've had here in Henderson. You practiced, I 
believe, 38 years. Yes, in Henderson. In

03:27.927 --> 03:28.488
Henderson. And before that, we'll be getting into 
your sort of biography in just a minute. And we want

03:33.655 --> 03:41.807
to sort of get an idea of why veterinary medicine, 
when it began in Texas and why. What started the

03:41.907 --> 03:45.752
interest in veterinary medicine? The history of 
veterinary medicine in Texas... is linked to the

03:48.620 --> 03:52.144
cattle industry and the Texas tick fever. All of us 
who are old enough to remember seeing cattle die in

03:53.786 --> 04:04.880
the 1920 era know how important Texas tick fever 
was to the cattle industry. The care and treatment

04:05.801 --> 04:15.153
of sick animals in Texas for many years were 
limited to the domestic livestock such as cattle,

04:05.801 --> 04:15.153
horses, mules, swine, sheep, and goats. But The 
main thing that people were interested in was the

04:17.813 --> 04:27.546
death of many cattle that were dying throughout 
the country with Texas tick fever. Who diagnosed

04:29.429 --> 04:30.951
Texas tick fever? Who gave it its name? It was 
called Texas tick fever because it was supposed

04:34.175 --> 04:43.468
that the disease was caused by the ticks, but they 
weren't sure. They had to prove it. And of

04:45.871 --> 04:46.572
course... As all of us older people remember,

04:47.986 --> 05:11.206
the Texas tick fever killed many cattle 
throughout the South, and the cattle that were on

04:47.986 --> 05:11.206
premises that were exposed in the northern states 
would die along the line of the trail drive as they

04:47.986 --> 05:11.206
went north. Texas was very unpopular. bringing 
their cattle into those other states. I bet it was.

05:18.276 --> 05:22.083
Okay, what years... Give us some dates when this 
began. What are we talking about here? We have

05:23.925 --> 05:38.749
recorded the fact that in 1855, the state of 
Missouri quit buying Texas cattle, boycotted

05:23.925 --> 05:38.749
Texas, you might say, because they had... had 
learned that the cattle that came from Texas would

05:39.067 --> 05:47.637
kill some of their herds if they were exposed to the 
Texas cattle. And that was before the Civil War in

05:48.037 --> 05:49.819
1855. So the seriousness of people boycotting 
Texas because of the Texas tick fever was reason

05:51.901 --> 06:06.778
enough to do something about this, because it was 
all the cattle in Texas and everything else, it was

05:51.901 --> 06:06.778
a big industry. What, of course, right now, the 
Texas A&M Veterinary Medicine Center in College

06:07.973 --> 06:20.014
Station is very famous for the veterinary school 
there. What brought it about? Give us a little

06:23.059 --> 06:24.522
background on it. How was Texas A&M Veterinary 
Medicine, how did you get it started? In 1888, a

06:31.548 --> 06:47.490
combination of factors paved the way for the 
advent of a serious program in veterinary studies

06:31.548 --> 06:47.490
initiated at the Agricultural and Mechanical 
College of Texas, now known as Texas A&M

06:31.548 --> 06:47.490
University. First, through the efforts of Dr. H. 
H. Dinwiddie, faculty chairman, the farmers and

06:48.712 --> 06:59.547
cattlemen around the state became aware of 
scientific breeding and care of livestock. Also,

07:00.387 --> 07:06.837
the decade of the 1880s marked the crossroads for 
the Texas livestock industry. A practical barbed

07:06.937 --> 07:18.355
wire invented by Joe Glidden of Illinois in 1873 
began to have a great impact on Texas open range and

07:06.937 --> 07:18.355
the cattle industry. The fencing wars of 1887 and 
1888 are recorded in the history of ranching and

07:19.016 --> 07:28.470
farming in the Central and Southwestern states. 
Then also influential to the development of

07:30.070 --> 07:39.161
veterinary medicine in Texas was the reluctance 
of the northern states to admit Texas cattle. Some

07:39.181 --> 07:45.569
Texas cattle were immune to the disease by having 
it occur and surviving when they were young. But

07:46.210 --> 07:51.977
northern cattle exposed to these Texas cattle 
produced epidemics which destroyed entire

07:46.210 --> 07:51.977
herds. Of course, some of the cattle would live 
through the disease but became carriers, like

07:53.189 --> 08:01.448
people who had malaria could be carriers. And 
those cattle, ticks would bite them and then go and

08:01.468 --> 08:08.565
bite healthy cattle in the northern states. and 
they would start dying. Okay. Our guest this

08:11.117 --> 08:27.746
morning is Dr. Hugh M. Phillips, a retired doctor 
of veterinary medicine who has served 38 years

08:11.117 --> 08:27.746
here in the Henderson area as a veterinarian, and 
we're talking about the history of veterinary

08:11.117 --> 08:27.746
medicine in Texas, and we've got a very 
interesting program and a lot of information to

08:11.117 --> 08:27.746
give you, so stay tuned this morning. We'll be back 
in just a moment. on the Roadshow for a Wednesday

08:30.770 --> 08:33.956
morning, March the 8th, 1989. Our guest, Dr. Hugh 
M. Phillips, retired doctor of veterinary

08:34.137 --> 08:37.664
medicine. We're talking about the history of 
veterinary medicine in Texas, and a little later

08:37.684 --> 08:51.090
on, we're going to be talking more about his 
career, when he began study in veterinary

08:37.684 --> 08:51.090
medicine, his interest in veterinary medicine, 
and also Some things he's run into here in Russ

08:51.070 --> 08:55.918
County over his 38-year career. Sorry about that, 
doctor. 38-year career. We're going to be

08:59.643 --> 09:01.747
throwing a lot of dates around at him. Matter of 
fact, we started as early as 1855 when Missouri

09:01.767 --> 09:07.716
stopped importing Texas cattle. And this came 
about because of Texas tick fever. It's something

09:11.502 --> 09:14.867
that was spreading and was very... deadly to the 
cattle in Texas and it was spreading and this did

09:15.742 --> 09:23.232
hurt the cattle industry in Texas. Therefore, the 
veterinary medicine industry got a real close

09:23.272 --> 09:28.920
looking at. And who were some of the early pioneers 
at Texas A&M University who came down and took a

09:29.440 --> 09:36.630
look at what was going on? Where did they come from? 
On June the 6th, 1888, Dr. Mark Francis became the

09:39.434 --> 09:45.462
first veterinarian hired by Texas A&M, and 
through his work with cattle, became one of the

09:45.745 --> 09:52.832
most distinguished men in American veterinary 
history. He was born in Ohio and graduated from

09:53.593 --> 10:02.482
Ohio State University in 1887 with degree of 
doctor of veterinary medicine. Dr. Francis

10:03.564 --> 10:11.652
worked as associate professor of vet science and 
veterinarian for the newly created experiment

10:03.564 --> 10:11.652
station. While Governor Lawrence Sullivan Ross 
was president of A&M College, the attitude of the

10:13.100 --> 10:20.411
public changed rapidly. Governor Ross asked for a 
building for chemistry and one for veterinary

10:20.931 --> 10:31.547
medicine, but the legislature would not 
appropriate the money in spite of the plea of

10:20.931 --> 10:31.547
farmers and ranchers. When Colonel L.L. Foster 
became president of A&M after Governor Ross's

10:34.243 --> 10:47.617
death, he asked for a building costing $75,000, 
but returned from Austin and said he could get only

10:34.243 --> 10:47.617
$35,000. The college accepted this $35,000 and 
built a two-story building. The ground floor was

10:54.444 --> 10:57.147
used for veterinary medicine. the second floor 
for chemistry. This building stood where the

10:59.670 --> 11:03.073
Cushing Library now stands. Dr. R.P. Marsteller, 
who was dean of the vet school in 1940 when I was

11:06.017 --> 11:19.372
entered into the School of Veterinary Medicine, 
joined Dr. Francis in 1905 in the efforts to

11:06.017 --> 11:19.372
control tick fever. He was also a graduate of the 
University of Ohio. Governor James Pappy

11:23.577 --> 11:27.201
Ferguson known well by all of the older people as 
Pappy, was impressed with the favorable results

11:27.299 --> 11:46.128
in immunizing cattle against Texas fever on his 
Bosque County ranch in February of 1916 and told

11:27.299 --> 11:46.128
the board of directors that he would approve an 
appropriation for suitable buildings for this

11:27.299 --> 11:46.128
purpose. The next session of the legislature 
provided $100,000 for a building. It was

11:52.578 --> 12:01.211
completed in 1918 through experiments in 
cooperation with Kansas Agricultural

11:52.578 --> 12:01.211
Experiment Station. In 1894, the transmission of 
the Texas tick fever was narrowed down to the

12:01.872 --> 12:11.607
common southern tick, Buophilus bovis. The 
discovery that the bite of this tick was the only

12:12.368 --> 12:19.699
way that Texas cattle fever was transmitted was 
the key to the problem of how to control the

12:20.118 --> 12:22.661
disease. Thus, by dipping all cattle with an 
arsenical dip, every two weeks the disease could

12:23.321 --> 12:31.390
be controlled. Okay, so that was a very important 
finding then. They found that they could control

12:34.233 --> 12:38.617
Texas tick fever by dipping cattle. Describe 
dipping to us. What is it? Well, all of the people

12:41.380 --> 12:49.669
who are lucky enough to be 65 years old and older can 
remember when all of our parents were dipping

12:50.088 --> 12:53.735
their cattle. It was a big day when a little guy 
could go help drive the cattle to the dipping vats.

13:01.769 --> 13:07.239
Of course, most of the older men who were dipping 
cattle then have already gone to their reward. But

13:07.940 --> 13:12.248
we who are between 60 and 70 years old remember 
helping to dip the cattle. In Gilmer, where I was

13:13.358 --> 13:22.231
born, I remember talking about it in the first 
grade, so that's why I know that it was in full swing

13:13.358 --> 13:22.231
in 1927.

13:24.715 --> 13:33.789
And also, I've heard many people talk about the 
dipping vats in Russ County that they remember as

13:24.715 --> 13:33.789
children. Did they completely submerge the 
cattle head and everything? Yes, the cattle would

13:38.587 --> 13:42.171
be pinned behind the dipping vat. They would have 
to be jumped off into the dipping vat. Then they

13:45.776 --> 13:51.543
would swim about 12 to 15 feet and then be able to 
walk out. And what was contained in the vat? An

13:55.467 --> 13:59.392
arsenical mixture with the water of arsenic. 
Okay, which when the ticks bit the cattle, the

13:59.973 --> 14:03.197
ticks died? Yes. Okay. One question I would have, 
was Texas tick fever transferable to humans, from

14:05.654 --> 14:11.423
cattle to humans? What happens when humans were 
bit by these ticks? The Texas tick fever did not

14:16.051 --> 14:21.419
affect people other than killing their cattle. It 
was a disease confined only to cattle caused by one

14:22.160 --> 14:30.193
species of tick. very similar to the disease of 
malaria that was seen in people in that it was a

14:30.815 --> 14:40.539
protozoan parasite that was being transferred. 
And this protozoan parasite lived in the red blood

14:41.140 --> 14:48.418
cells and destroyed the red blood cells, 
producing anemia and jaundice. And one of the

14:49.951 --> 14:58.064
seriousnesses of this disease was that it was 
causing a loss of money to Texas. I believe you have

14:58.705 --> 15:05.416
some facts and figures on how much it was costing us 
back then and the seriousness of it. Give us a

15:05.857 --> 15:08.601
little history on that after they... saw that 
there was a problem, they needed to find a cure. But

15:12.537 --> 15:18.138
before that, I believe some studies were made, and 
how much money was Texas losing? Way back in, I

15:18.178 --> 15:20.667
believe it was the early 1900s. Well, despite the 
perfection of the dipping vats and inoculation of

15:21.575 --> 15:41.880
caves with blood from infected animals, which 
would give the young caves the disease, and most of

15:21.575 --> 15:41.880
them would live through it if they took the disease 
as a cave, and the caves were fed and properly

15:21.575 --> 15:41.880
treated, and that would immunize them. In spite of 
this... Dr. Francis reported in 1912 that losses

15:43.850 --> 15:54.821
from this disease in the United States still 
approached $50 million per year in deaths and

15:43.850 --> 15:54.821
restrictions of trade. Texas tick fever was 
finally eradicated in the early 1930s by this

15:55.562 --> 16:08.015
compulsory dipping of all cattle every two to two 
and a half weeks during spring, summer, and fall.

16:08.836 --> 16:10.077
But in 1911, The biannual report by the government 
included a new reason for establishing the School

16:10.782 --> 16:27.458
of Veterinary Medicine at A&M, giving the number 
and the value of Texas domestic livestock as 16

16:10.782 --> 16:27.458
million animals, valued at $350 million. So with 
this much investment in the cattle industry here,

16:28.687 --> 16:41.647
we needed a ready supply of veterinarians, and 
there weren't that many veterinarians in Texas at

16:28.687 --> 16:41.647
that time, just under 100, as I understand. That's 
right. The care of all of these animals rested in

16:43.148 --> 16:56.568
the hands of only 75 out-of-state graduate 
veterinarians who were graduated in other states

16:43.148 --> 16:56.568
because Texas didn't have a veterinary school. 
Several hundred untrained but certified

16:57.329 --> 17:02.457
practitioners were also practicing a third group 
of self-styled veterinarians, usually referred

17:02.639 --> 17:18.252
to by most people as quacks, whose impossible 
remedies and irregular business methods had

17:02.639 --> 17:18.252
disgusted the public for years. In 1914, The state 
of Texas certified anyone who actively

17:22.197 --> 17:32.608
participated in the health care of domestic 
animals for five consecutive years preceding

17:22.197 --> 17:32.608
1914. I remember old Dr. Hare up at Gilmer, who was 
treating the cattle and the horses when I was a

17:34.030 --> 17:42.259
child. And he was a certified non-graduate, moved 
from Winnsboro to Gilmer. Okay, so where we're up

17:50.041 --> 18:02.558
to right about now is the 1914-1915 era, and we're 
just before A&M begins a veterinary medical

17:50.041 --> 18:02.558
school. And we want to take a quick break right here 
and mention that Dr. Hugh M. Phillips is our guest

18:02.979 --> 18:08.326
this morning on the talk show. He's a retired 
doctor of veterinary medicine and involved in a

18:08.346 --> 18:15.576
book being compiled now, The History of 
Veterinary Medicine in Texas. And we're going to

18:15.556 --> 18:30.876
be talking more and at length about the history 
this morning and also his 38-year career here in

18:15.556 --> 18:30.876
Henderson as well and some of the particular and 
peculiar diseases that he's seen over the years

18:15.556 --> 18:30.876
here in Russ County and East Texas. So stay with us 
this morning with Dr. Hugh M. Phillips, retired

18:30.896 --> 18:36.363
doctor of veterinary medicine. We'll be back in 
just a moment. Roadshow for Wednesday morning

18:38.118 --> 18:58.506
March the 8th 1989 our subject this morning is the 
history of veterinary medicine in Texas and we're

18:38.118 --> 18:58.506
going to be getting even more specific as that of 
here in Rusk County in just a few minutes but we're

18:38.118 --> 18:58.506
trying to lead you up and show you where veterinary 
medicine got started here in the state of Texas our

18:38.118 --> 18:58.506
guest is 38-year veteran here in Russ County of the 
veterinary profession, Dr. Hugh M. Phillips,

18:58.486 --> 19:08.217
retired doctor of veterinary medicine. And he's 
our guest, and he's one of several men who are

19:08.858 --> 19:18.568
compiling the information for a book which will be 
entitled The History of Veterinary Medicine in

19:08.858 --> 19:18.568
Texas. And let's see, Dr. Phillips, tell us about 
the founders of the College of Veterinary

19:19.309 --> 19:26.417
Medicine at A&M. We're back in probably the early 
1900s, around 1910 to 1915. Give us some dates, and

19:32.206 --> 19:36.692
who were these people that started it? Well, A&M 
had already hired Dr. Francis in 1888. In 1911,

19:40.939 --> 19:47.148
Dr. R.C. Dunn, another Ohio veterinarian, joined 
the A&M faculty as chief laboratory technician in

19:53.752 --> 19:56.576
charge of the production of whole cholera serum. 
That was another disease that was real important

19:56.936 --> 20:01.182
in Texas. In 1913, the last of the four founders of 
the College of Veterinary Medicine at A&M joined

20:02.123 --> 20:09.373
the faculty. Dr. Hubert Smith of Comfort, Texas, 
received his DVM degree from the Royal Veterinary

20:10.034 --> 20:20.468
College in Berlin, Germany in 1912. and joined the 
staff at A&M working to control two other diseases

20:20.819 --> 20:39.264
which were called Creeps, C-R-E-E-P-S, and 
Loewen disease caused by mineral deficiencies

20:20.819 --> 20:39.264
and seen along the Texas Gulf Coast before 
minerals were added to the cattle feeding

20:20.819 --> 20:39.264
programs.

20:41.867 --> 20:47.535
He was the fourth of the founders of veterinary 
medicine at Texas A&M.

20:50.249 --> 21:05.931
During the decades after 1900, the veterinarians 
at A&M also worked extensively and successfully

20:50.249 --> 21:05.931
to control anthrax, black leg, tetanus, rabies, 
hoof and mouth disease, and hog cholera. What year

21:06.271 --> 21:10.637
specifically was the College of Veterinary 
Medicine begun? On April the 10th, 1916, the Board

21:11.208 --> 21:18.040
of Directors established the School of 
Veterinary Medicine at College Station. Dr. Mark

21:18.321 --> 21:20.705
Francis was made the first dean. Okay, and let's 
see, they started... working on all these

21:25.417 --> 21:28.521
diseases that were common to Texas. And what kind 
of facilities, what did they do to, what were their

21:29.362 --> 21:34.770
early buildings like? How much money did they have 
to spend? Did the state legislature come in with

21:36.712 --> 21:41.719
some money, or who provided the funding to begin 
the school? I already mentioned the fact that they

21:42.801 --> 21:48.068
had secured money to build one building. Right. 
And, of course, in 1932, the A&M directors decided

21:54.037 --> 22:03.087
to build a new vet hospital and clinic at the total 
cost of $225,000. That's a lot of money in 1932,

22:03.868 --> 22:07.613
wasn't it? Right. And that money was derived from 
oil funds. The East Texas oil boom was in swing, and

22:13.119 --> 22:19.386
a lot of money was going to Austin. So they were able 
to build a few additional buildings in 1932 and

22:19.771 --> 22:25.384
1933. Those were the buildings that I used as a 
student. They were over on the east side of the A&M

22:32.983 --> 22:38.235
campus. But in 1953 and 55, a new and modern 
veterinary complex was erected west of the

22:39.953 --> 22:52.769
railroad on Farm Highway 60, costing millions of 
dollars.

22:55.572 --> 23:03.362
The first class of graduates of the A&M Veterinary 
School was 13 in number, and they graduated in 19

22:55.572 --> 23:03.362
and 20. 68 years ago dr raymond childers of jasper 
was the only one of those older men i personally

23:03.815 --> 23:28.557
knew he used to attend some of the conventions 
years ago he graduated 13 people in 1920 68 years

23:03.815 --> 23:28.557
ago my goodness and you met one of the original 13 
and knew him okay um Tell us about the years of the

23:29.870 --> 23:38.302
20s and 30s for the veterinary. They started 
graduating in 1920. What was it like for a

23:39.945 --> 23:44.211
veterinary? Well, during the 1920s and 1930s, a 
county in Texas was lucky to have a graduate

23:44.391 --> 23:53.344
veterinarian in the county. And some counties 
didn't have graduate veterinarians until after

23:54.365 --> 23:59.573
World War II. because many of the veterinarians 
volunteered and joined the armed services during

24:00.397 --> 24:07.629
World War II. My hometown of Gilmer, Upshur 
County, was without a graduate practitioner

24:08.711 --> 24:18.507
until 1953 when Dr. Chester Studdard moved there 
from Tyler. Well, let's get into a little bit about

24:19.988 --> 24:25.634
what interested you in veterinary medicine. I 
guess as a child, you must have been interested in

24:25.734 --> 24:28.077
animals. Tell us your story. You said you grew up in 
Gilmer. Tell us about that. As a child, I was always

24:32.242 --> 24:36.526
interested in animals of any kind. I had what my 
friends told me was a menagerie. They didn't call

24:42.313 --> 24:48.219
it a zoo, but the backyard and cow pasture was full 
of animals. I had goats. and cattle and donkeys,

24:49.992 --> 25:00.682
rabbits and all kinds of pets, possums and 
whatever I could find to put in a cage and take care

24:49.992 --> 25:00.682
of. And then also I helped to take care of all the 
neighbors' animals. And I became a people person

25:06.488 --> 25:11.133
as well as an animal lover. Don't give me any kind of 
work to do on mechanics, anything related to

25:12.334 --> 25:19.881
people or animals I'm interested in. Of course, 
after that interest in animals, I went to A&M in

25:20.198 --> 25:34.372
1938 thinking I wanted to become a county agent 
because I admired the county agent at Gilmer, Mr.

25:20.198 --> 25:34.372
W.D. Seals. I had never known a graduate 
veterinarian. But after I became a student at A&M,

25:39.718 --> 25:46.965
looking at the textbooks of the vet students, I 
became interested. And I was visiting my brother

25:48.059 --> 25:58.249
out in Rock Springs, Texas, Edwards County, and 
the county agent out there was doing the vet work.

25:58.269 --> 26:04.395
My brother, being a young MD, would assist the 
county agent if it was some valuable animal. So I

26:05.596 --> 26:14.105
was down there one Thanksgiving, and the two of 
them asked me why I didn't study veterinary

26:05.596 --> 26:14.105
medicine. How old were you at that time? Well, I had 
been in A&M a year and a half. So I was possibly about

26:18.984 --> 26:23.290
19 and a half years old. So when I got back to A&M, I 
visited Dr. Marsteller in the dean's office and

26:25.073 --> 26:34.466
found out that I could easily change my course to 
veterinary medicine. And that's the way I changed

26:34.486 --> 26:41.877
my mind and decided to be a veterinarian instead of 
a county agent. I noticed in the notes that you had

26:42.548 --> 26:48.775
met Dr. Francis. Now, he was the first licensed 
veterinarian that came to A&M in 1888. Mark

26:56.384 --> 26:57.826
Francis, is that correct? Right, Dr. Mark 
Francis. Tell us that story when you got to meet

26:59.808 --> 27:02.412
him. I believe you didn't know who he was when you 
met him until a couple of years later. As a child,

27:07.217 --> 27:11.222
about 11 or 12 years old, I was lucky enough that I 
got to go to A&M and spend a week when my father and

27:12.012 --> 27:28.176
the man who lived on my father's farm wanted to go 
and attend one of the short courses, a seminar.

27:30.820 --> 27:37.750
The Chafin family lived on my father's old home 
place and two of their sons and one of my brothers

27:37.882 --> 27:45.591
and I accompanied our fathers, and while they were 
attending the seminar, we could get out and roam

27:37.882 --> 27:45.591
the campus. We were responsible children back in 
those days, and they didn't worry about us, so we

27:46.592 --> 27:55.862
visited all the buildings that were open. One was a 
small museum, and in this museum, They had the

28:00.157 --> 28:22.487
little lambs that were born with two heads and a 
little calf that had six legs and a colt that had two

28:00.157 --> 28:22.487
hoofs on each of its back legs. Things like that I 
remember as though it happened yesterday. And in

28:29.384 --> 28:38.114
this laboratory, or rather in this museum, was an 
old gentleman wearing a white coat and long white

28:29.384 --> 28:38.114
hair. And I later learned, when I went to A&M, that 
he was Dr. Mark Francis, who had become interested

28:39.655 --> 28:50.847
in that museum. And that was the year of probably 
19... 30 or 31 that I met him there and spoke to him

28:57.447 --> 29:17.555
but had no idea who he was until I became a vet 
student in 1940 and I was told that Dr. Mark Francis

28:57.447 --> 29:17.555
was there in charge of that small museum the last 
few years that he lived. He lived until 36 and I

29:17.975 --> 29:26.627
became a student at A&M in 38 and a vet student in 40. 
Okay. All right, tell us about when you entered vet

29:29.072 --> 29:32.956
school in 1940. When did you graduate, and what did 
you do upon graduation? In 1940, I became a student

29:38.022 --> 29:41.766
of veterinary medicine. And, of course, World War 
II started in 1941. And before I graduated, the

29:49.574 --> 29:55.180
ASTP, ASTP, Army Specialized Training Program, 
started. And about half of the senior class and

30:02.320 --> 30:24.323
most of the juniors and sophomores in the vet 
school were interested in Army careers, so they

30:02.320 --> 30:24.323
were taken to San Antonio and inducted into the 
Army and returned to A&M and finished their

30:02.320 --> 30:24.323
studies there. And that was when Major Charles D. 
Apple, who resided here in Russ County for many

30:24.742 --> 30:33.930
years, became our commanding officer. I met him at 
A&M, and then he was one of my very good friends when

30:34.270 --> 30:40.336
I started practicing here. And many people know 
the Charles Apple family who lived out on the

30:40.956 --> 30:45.701
Kilgore Highway. After graduating from A&M in 
October of 43, six of us in the class received

30:54.222 --> 31:18.964
commissions as first lieutenants and then we went 
into the army left by train from dallas and arrived

30:54.222 --> 31:18.964
at carlisle barracks pennsylvania after about 
three days and went through this overseas

30:54.222 --> 31:18.964
training school at carlisle barracks that was the 
school at jim thorpe a famous
