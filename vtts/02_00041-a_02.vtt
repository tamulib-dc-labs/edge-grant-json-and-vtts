WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:05.223
And long distance telephones.

00:05.503 --> 00:18.078
And on Sunday morning, I went with my daddy to put out the newspapers at the Y. And when we got there, somebody told us that the Japanese had struck Pearl Harbor.

00:19.239 --> 00:21.562
And I remember how upset my daddy was.

00:22.403 --> 00:26.047
I wasn't sure exactly what it meant, but I knew my daddy was very upset.

00:28.430 --> 00:31.894
And do you remember any activities later in the day?

00:32.110 --> 00:34.674
No, I don't remember anything else that happened.

00:37.058 --> 00:37.919
Not that day.

00:38.500 --> 00:49.597
I remember that the A&M class volunteered in mass shortly thereafter, but I really don't remember anything other than us going to the Y that day.

00:50.358 --> 00:52.140
Now, was that after church?

00:52.401 --> 00:53.823
No, this was before church.

00:54.664 --> 00:55.986
Before church.

00:56.006 --> 00:56.107
Yeah.

00:56.147 --> 00:58.871
Let's digress on to religious activities.

00:59.732 --> 01:01.054
Describe as you

01:01.456 --> 01:08.404
as much as you can, the activities that the Y coordinated before the war.

01:08.424 --> 01:10.046
What all happened at the Y?

01:10.066 --> 01:14.511
Well, the Y had a series of things.

01:14.551 --> 01:22.220
First of all, the Indian Presbyterian Church met in the Y, and since we were members of that congregation, well, we went to that all the time.

01:22.300 --> 01:30.349
But the Y also coordinated the religious activities on the campus.

01:30.650 --> 01:34.915
It did a lot of things as far as new students were concerned.

01:36.217 --> 01:58.024
The Y sent out a packet to all incoming freshmen with the so-called fish handbook with a card that they indicated their religious preferences and when those cards came back they always separated them and gave those cards to the various churches.

01:58.493 --> 02:10.447
The Y operated what they call Religious Emphasis Week, which they would bring in a series of speakers for various reasons for a week-long program.

02:11.869 --> 02:22.982
The main one was held in Guyon Hall, and then they would have meetings or services every night with different people.

02:22.962 --> 02:32.235
And the Y also coordinated and operated the theater and the assembly hall across the street.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.581
I guess those are the main things.

02:37.282 --> 02:42.309
Was your dad a Texas A&M employee or an employee of the YMCA?

02:42.469 --> 02:44.933
No, he was an employee of A&M.

02:44.953 --> 02:48.598
In those days, the Y was basically everything that academics weren't.

02:49.338 --> 02:57.269
It was the MSC, it was the intramural office, it was the student activities office.

02:57.369 --> 03:01.475
It was basically everything that didn't involve class work in the early days.

03:02.136 --> 03:02.636
Let's see.

03:03.698 --> 03:05.059
Yale practice was held.

03:05.360 --> 03:10.267
On the steps of the Y. What about muster?

03:10.287 --> 03:14.212
Was muster held before the war?

03:14.412 --> 03:15.594
I don't know the answer to that.

03:15.694 --> 03:16.455
Silver taps?

03:16.475 --> 03:17.877
Silver taps was held.

03:18.413 --> 03:27.002
at the bugle stand right outside the Y or the academic building.

03:27.022 --> 03:36.952
Let's see, do you remember, before the war, do you remember any kind of arguments over something the Y did or failed to do?

03:39.414 --> 03:45.180
One of the things that the Y did that Daddy was very involved in was the foreign students.

03:48.653 --> 03:58.606
There were a good many foreign students who began to come to A&M and there really wasn't any, there was nothing set up to handle them.

03:58.626 --> 04:01.970
The Y set up an organization called the Cosmopolitan Club.

04:03.052 --> 04:11.202
And the Cosmopolitan Club basically was all the foreign students that had come to A&M for whatever reason.

04:11.738 --> 04:18.909
And about that time, we began to get a good many students from places like India and Pakistan and places like that.

04:19.270 --> 04:30.327
And they had their own club, which was sponsored by the Y. Were there other nationalities?

04:31.088 --> 04:31.809
Latin American?

04:31.890 --> 04:32.230
Yes.

04:32.551 --> 04:32.971
Where?

04:32.991 --> 04:33.512
Which nations?

04:34.754 --> 04:39.822
A good many people from Mexico and a good many people from several of the South American countries.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.996
Yes, but I don't think there were a good many Japanese that were here.

04:50.382 --> 04:58.300
I don't remember many Chinese particularly, but there were a good many Japanese here prior to the war.

04:59.663 --> 05:07.712
But did anybody ever accuse the Y of doing something that was inappropriate or failing to do something?

05:07.873 --> 05:10.876
I don't ever remember anything about it.

05:11.397 --> 05:15.482
No Jewish, Christian, no liberal, conservative?

05:15.582 --> 05:17.364
No, I don't remember any of that.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.025
It could have been.

05:18.385 --> 05:25.513
Were there ever any arguments over a formal denomination like the Presbyterians meeting on campus?

05:26.495 --> 05:27.476
No, there was.

05:27.596 --> 05:28.557
I don't know it.

05:29.060 --> 05:33.906
What other groups met on the campus regularly?

05:35.207 --> 05:37.010
Well, you had a Union Sunday School.

05:38.191 --> 05:41.475
The Union Sunday School was made up of basically all the churches.

05:46.962 --> 05:51.287
As I recall, the Hillel Foundation met there in its early years.

05:53.343 --> 05:57.808
That's about the only one I think of.

05:57.828 --> 05:59.570
Were there any Jewish faculty members?

05:59.590 --> 05:59.910
Yes.

06:00.911 --> 06:04.736
Any key names you remember in those early years?

06:14.427 --> 06:21.915
I can think of a couple of people, but I can't tell you what their names were.

06:22.503 --> 06:41.271
As far as I have been able to listen to others recollect, I have not run across any memories of antagonism and to turn it around in a positive way.

06:41.926 --> 06:47.915
that apparently there was respect for other people's beliefs and backgrounds and so forth?

06:47.935 --> 06:48.556
I think so.

06:48.937 --> 06:50.660
I don't ever remember.

06:55.127 --> 07:10.110
I can remember Daddy getting into some disagreements or something about whether or not certain things ought to be done, but that always seemed very minor.

07:10.090 --> 07:28.875
Daddy was always one that was involved in all different faiths because of his role at the Y. And I know that some of his best friends were some of the priests that were in Bryan as far as the Catholic Church was concerned.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.822
But I really don't remember any controversy over that sort of thing.

07:34.162 --> 07:38.528
As far as you recall, he administratively, he reported to whom?

07:39.048 --> 07:44.575
He would have reported to the dean of men up that chain.

07:44.595 --> 07:57.712
Who probably, who, at about the time the war started?

07:57.732 --> 08:02.738
It wouldn't have been Colonel Andy.

08:02.758 --> 08:03.339
I don't know.

08:03.359 --> 08:08.245
I expect during that time he would probably reported to Dr. Walton as much as anybody.

08:09.592 --> 08:12.315
Describe Dr. Walton.

08:12.335 --> 08:26.408
Dr. Walton was a very distinguished, slow speaking, and from what I understand, very sympathetic person.

08:26.708 --> 08:35.717
I mean, I know of cases where Dr. Walton would administer discipline

08:36.153 --> 08:50.263
that was different from what was recommended on the basis that he had a feel for that person and basically telling them don't do that again or you're gonna be gone, but overriding other people.

08:51.847 --> 08:56.352
had a great interest in A&M and wanted A&M to grow very much.

08:57.493 --> 09:07.043
And he and Mrs. Walton were very distinguished people, quite proper, and very elegant in their mannerisms.

09:09.766 --> 09:17.353
On that point, what were the social activities that faculty and staff professionals?

09:17.814 --> 09:20.757
Well, the thing I remember more than anything else is we used to have

09:21.344 --> 09:24.429
parties and things at the house, particularly for the students.

09:25.190 --> 09:35.465
My mother and daddy had a three gallon ice cream freezer and we used to crank that up during the hot weather all the time and have meetings there.

09:36.146 --> 09:46.422
I remember mom and daddy going to things such as domino parties and 42 parties.

09:47.944 --> 09:49.326
I really don't remember

09:50.437 --> 09:53.661
many social activities for the faculty.

09:56.885 --> 10:12.563
Other than that, except all of the student, particularly in the spring, the ring dance and all of the senior ball and all that kind of stuff, because I used to go stand and watch all the girls and the guys go into Cebiza for the dance.

10:12.583 --> 10:17.749
Did your parents house some of the young ladies?

10:17.809 --> 10:19.431
Yes, they did.

10:19.546 --> 10:20.387
Do you have any idea?

10:21.328 --> 10:29.699
No, but it seemed like there was always somebody staying at our house.

10:32.423 --> 10:42.936
As these social events were going on, these dances and so forth, how were the young ladies treated by Aggie students?

10:42.956 --> 10:44.739
Well, I think they were always treated very well.

10:44.899 --> 10:47.342
I really had a problem with that growing up.

10:47.862 --> 10:51.706
Because I never saw a girl that wasn't escorted by somebody.

10:52.607 --> 11:02.516
And the idea of a girl walking down the street by herself, I guess bothered me way late in my life.

11:03.077 --> 11:07.821
I thought you were supposed to be escorted because I had never seen one that wasn't escorted.

11:09.142 --> 11:13.026
And socially, that really caused me a problem.

11:13.867 --> 11:17.110
I've heard a number of the

11:17.714 --> 11:24.224
Men say that, as far as they know, the women were treated almost like visiting royalty.

11:24.244 --> 11:25.306
Yes, I think so.

11:25.326 --> 11:37.846
I mean, it was... There weren't enough dates to go around so that there were many of the guys cutting in on each other to dance with as many of the girls as possible.

11:37.906 --> 11:38.207
Right.

11:38.507 --> 11:43.054
Now, the dances and so forth were almost always in Sebisa.

11:43.175 --> 11:44.076
Yes.

11:44.242 --> 11:48.290
Did your father and mother have any responsibility for those?

11:48.350 --> 12:01.596
No, I don't remember anything particular that they ever had to do with those dances, other than the fact that there was somebody always staying at the house.

12:01.676 --> 12:04.562
Now let's chat about the Presbyterian Church.

12:05.791 --> 12:10.217
As early as your memory goes, was the church organized?

12:10.718 --> 12:12.881
Yes, it was organized.

12:16.266 --> 12:19.571
Mr. Anderson was the minister, as long as I can remember.

12:21.854 --> 12:30.246
For Sunday school, my earliest memory, we met in the assembly hall.

12:30.597 --> 12:33.221
And we also met in the basement of Guyon Hall.

12:37.146 --> 12:40.351
And as I said, that was a union Sunday school.

12:42.314 --> 12:52.689
And we met in the chapel at the Y for Sunday morning service.

12:52.709 --> 12:55.052
And then we also had a junior league

12:55.505 --> 12:59.068
in the community that met there on Sunday evening.

12:59.208 --> 13:00.469
Was that interdenominational?

13:00.489 --> 13:01.390
Yes.

13:02.491 --> 13:07.856
Who were some of the key Presbyterian colleagues?

13:07.876 --> 13:18.645
Well, the Paynes, the, let me think of names.

13:19.566 --> 13:25.191
I used to be head of accounting, Lelands.

13:26.723 --> 13:31.407
Gammon.

13:31.427 --> 13:32.388
Gammon.

13:32.448 --> 13:36.112
Dr. Gammon and Mrs. Gammon and the boys.

13:37.513 --> 13:42.798
Sam Ray and whoever the other one's name was.

13:43.759 --> 13:46.961
Any of the administrators?

13:46.981 --> 13:47.702
The Hickerson's.

13:55.449 --> 13:56.410
Let me think.

13:57.622 --> 14:01.446
Walter Manning.

14:10.715 --> 14:16.281
Dr. John, John, John, what was his last name?

14:19.404 --> 14:20.465
I'm drawing a blank.

14:22.527 --> 14:23.528
Luther Jones.

14:27.743 --> 14:55.624
Quisenberry.

14:55.722 --> 14:57.043
I don't like to think of.

14:57.063 --> 15:05.973
Did you college station, or excuse me, did you college Presbyterians associate much with the Bryan Presbyterian Church?

15:06.053 --> 15:08.515
I don't ever remember associating at all.

15:08.896 --> 15:10.077
I have not heard of any of those.

15:10.097 --> 15:11.639
No, I don't ever remember.

15:11.659 --> 15:16.684
Now at the North Gate, what other churches were there before World War II?

15:20.548 --> 15:21.849
The Baptist Church was there.

15:22.370 --> 15:23.671
The Methodist Church was there.

15:23.731 --> 15:25.273
The Catholic Church was there.

15:29.084 --> 15:30.005
I think that's it.

15:30.045 --> 15:32.068
I don't know whether the Church of Christ was or not.

15:33.390 --> 15:37.094
I don't know when they were organized.

15:37.215 --> 15:41.300
All right, now back to family.

15:42.021 --> 15:46.086
Your dad serves as Y Director until when?

15:46.186 --> 15:48.990
He retired July the 1st, 1952.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.432
1952.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.517
But you all moved off campus.

15:55.498 --> 15:56.880
In 1952.

16:00.269 --> 16:02.992
39, 40, something like that.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.413
Probably moved off in 1941.

16:05.194 --> 16:08.977
We probably stayed up on the campus two years while they were moving that out.

16:09.438 --> 16:09.558
Right.

16:09.578 --> 16:13.281
And your mom does not take the responsibilities over at the board house?

16:13.361 --> 16:14.302
Until 1952.

16:14.483 --> 16:17.926
Oh, okay.

16:17.946 --> 16:18.046
Okay.

16:18.066 --> 16:23.351
So you're in junior high during World War II.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.154
Your brother's away.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.656
Let's go back and...

16:29.412 --> 16:37.183
would you please describe your recollection of those great football games in 39 and 40?

16:38.365 --> 16:45.195
Yeah, I went down there and I sold some peanuts.

16:46.336 --> 16:49.241
I also remember going to a few of the games early.

16:49.281 --> 16:50.222
There used to be a

16:50.641 --> 16:59.192
what they call the Knothole Gang, that could sit in the horseshoe, and we paid 25 cents for a ticket.

16:59.413 --> 17:03.939
And I went to a few of those games.

17:04.179 --> 17:10.067
But I don't remember, as a little bitty youngster, going to many football games.

17:10.621 --> 17:12.003
But by 38 and 39.

17:12.183 --> 17:16.128
I was beginning to go to some of them.

17:16.148 --> 17:16.969
Did you have a hero?

17:17.390 --> 17:25.961
Yeah, I was always, one of the things I always enjoyed was the prompt and circumstance of the football game.

17:26.021 --> 17:40.459
In those days, people dressed up, and they had the special trains that came in there, and Baylor would bring their bear, and they'd tie the bear up by the Aggieland Inn, and I remember going as a little kid,

17:40.439 --> 17:44.505
because that bear would pop soda bottles and drink soda pop.

17:45.287 --> 17:47.310
But it was always fun to watch the bears.

17:48.331 --> 17:52.438
And for some reason to me, the special trains always fascinated me.

17:52.879 --> 18:02.093
But they used to run special trains from Houston and Waco and Dallas to come in for a football game and they'd sit there and then they'd get back on them and ride back home.

18:03.642 --> 18:12.690
Were you at all acquainted with Coach Norton during that era?

18:13.351 --> 18:13.671
Yes.

18:13.831 --> 18:14.532
I knew of him.

18:14.772 --> 18:15.793
I knew who he was.

18:15.813 --> 18:18.796
I think I remember talking to him.

18:20.137 --> 18:21.719
What kind of personality did he have?

18:24.141 --> 18:31.928
Well, as I remember, Coach Norton was a pretty stern fellow, but always pretty friendly.

18:32.262 --> 18:34.826
I don't remember too much about that.

18:36.308 --> 18:39.573
Did you have any heroes in the national championship squad?

18:39.593 --> 18:46.223
Yeah, one of the people that Jitterbug Henderson always fascinated me and so did Papa Wesson.

18:47.064 --> 18:49.007
I thought he was the biggest guy I ever saw.

18:49.308 --> 18:51.150
Yeah, I don't remember what he was.

18:51.170 --> 18:55.717
Papa Wesson was a guard or a tackle, I think.

18:58.261 --> 19:00.885
We used to go to more baseball games.

19:01.557 --> 19:14.355
really than football games because we could get into baseball games after school and we'd go and eat peanuts and sit in those old green bleachers that were there and watch baseball games.

19:14.835 --> 19:16.017
Colonel Andy was the?

19:16.037 --> 19:17.559
Colonel Andy was the track coach.

19:17.579 --> 19:18.821
Oh no, the track coach.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.845
Who coached baseball then?

19:21.905 --> 19:24.949
In those days it was probably Marty Corot.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.709
And the Aggies were good in all the sports then?

19:29.809 --> 19:32.833
Pretty good in all the sports, yeah, pretty good.

19:33.253 --> 19:44.124
Do you remember any kind of special events in any of the athletic, there weren't any rainstorms, there weren't any bleachers collapsing?

19:44.545 --> 19:46.387
No, I don't remember anything of that type.

19:46.407 --> 19:51.392
The only real bad weather I remember, I guess, would have been 19...

19:54.376 --> 19:58.440
To tell you the truth, I don't know if it was 47 or 57 when A&M played TCU.

20:00.662 --> 20:04.446
It was the only game I ever remember that you absolutely could not buy a ticket.

20:06.028 --> 20:07.790
I mean, there were no tickets anywhere.

20:08.350 --> 20:20.923
And as a hurricane came in, Bryan Field was going full blast, and they called all the people out that worked at Bryan Field.

20:22.658 --> 20:24.361
It rained so hard you couldn't see.

20:25.182 --> 20:29.349
And they had a very controversial call about whether TCU scored or not.

20:29.689 --> 20:31.152
But anyway, A&M beat them 76.

20:31.252 --> 20:35.959
So that was probably a tropical hurricane.

20:36.140 --> 20:36.340
Yeah.

20:36.961 --> 20:39.244
Yeah.

20:39.785 --> 20:43.491
So as a youngster, you didn't have an acquaintance with John Kimbrough or?

20:44.353 --> 20:44.893
Not really.

20:46.095 --> 20:48.379
I knew a good many of the students at the Y.

20:49.304 --> 20:55.030
There was a guy by the name of David Thrift who was the president of the student body in 1939.

20:55.330 --> 21:07.623
I remember some of the people that had peanut concessions and I knew some of those people, but I really wasn't that involved with the A&M athletes.

21:08.544 --> 21:15.632
All right, as the war is over, let's see, do you remember back up just a few months?

21:16.102 --> 21:19.807
Do you remember your hearing that President Roosevelt had died?

21:19.827 --> 21:20.468
Yes, I do.

21:20.748 --> 21:21.089
Where?

21:25.154 --> 21:40.776
My brother was at Fort Hood and Temple, and I remember somebody telling us that President Roosevelt had died, and I was in school at the time, and I just remember that it was just kind of like a haze went over the

21:41.363 --> 21:45.909
whole school, because most of us, that's the only president we'd ever known.

21:48.733 --> 21:57.505
I was in the shower after eighth grade spring football, and a kid yelled in the shower that that had happened and snickered.

21:58.266 --> 22:00.129
And we said, hey, that's not a funny joke.

22:00.169 --> 22:01.551
And he said, no, it's not a joke.

22:02.772 --> 22:06.437
And when I got home, I realized I put on my clothes without drying off.

22:07.178 --> 22:10.543
I was so touched with it.

22:11.452 --> 22:17.485
Then when the war was over, your brother gets back home.

22:20.732 --> 22:30.372
Brother Jim, I went to Korea.

22:33.997 --> 22:37.942
about the time the war was over and came back about two years after that.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.826
Oh, so he didn't get home right after that?

22:40.846 --> 22:40.966
No.

22:42.068 --> 22:46.774
And you're now getting up near high school graduation.

22:47.876 --> 22:52.442
Describe how the campus changed as all these veterans came back.

22:53.744 --> 23:00.493
Well, there was a lot of argument about what to do with the veterans.

23:01.064 --> 23:07.393
Big fights I remember is they took Walton Hall and converted it into apartments for married students.

23:09.235 --> 23:18.568
And they put some clotheslines at the back inside that view for them to use.

23:18.968 --> 23:29.282
And the battalion championed for a whole semester that they shouldn't be allowed to hang unmentionables on a clothesline at A&M.

23:30.308 --> 23:34.894
And that kind of started the fuss and the fight.

23:36.055 --> 23:43.825
And then the veterans, the veterans first came back, they didn't really get very much involved in A&M.

23:43.845 --> 23:50.753
And then shortly after that, they began to get more involved in the politics and the organizations and everything else.

23:50.813 --> 23:54.538
And then there was a lot of resentment.

23:55.038 --> 23:57.902
The Corps had a veterans unit.

23:58.658 --> 24:01.401
and there was a lot of resentment between it and the Corps.

24:03.603 --> 24:13.054
But all that began to fade away a little bit, and about that time they began to build some new buildings and do a lot of construction.

24:13.574 --> 24:17.659
And there were trailers and hutments everywhere?

24:17.859 --> 24:24.606
There were trailers and shacks and other things all over the place.

24:26.068 --> 24:28.210
And your dad's responsibilities

24:29.000 --> 24:31.083
I guess, became larger.

24:32.385 --> 24:38.553
Well, they did to some degree, except that other things began to happen.

24:38.613 --> 24:42.818
The Intramural Department was formed in the meantime.

24:43.700 --> 24:51.390
The Dean of Students, or Dean of Men as it was called originally, was now in place.

24:52.391 --> 24:57.538
And a lot of the roles that the Y used to have began to be moved

24:58.683 --> 25:05.994
to other units, and the role of the Y began to diminish about that time.

25:06.695 --> 25:18.193
All right, and then Wayne Stark was hired, and was it clear to everyone when he was hired that this was to create what is now the Memorial Student Center?

25:18.413 --> 25:25.804
Yes, I think it was clear when Wayne was hired, but I don't think that anyone or anyone that I knew

25:26.527 --> 25:40.687
particularly knew exactly what the MSC was to become compared to some other things that happened, and of course many of the functions of the Y were absorbed by the Memorial Student Center.

25:40.827 --> 25:46.175
As far as you're aware, what administrator made that decision regarding?

25:46.195 --> 25:48.378
I don't know the answer to that.

25:48.398 --> 25:50.020
Was your dad comfortable with

25:50.978 --> 25:52.980
he's getting close to retirement.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.802
Was he comfortable with this newcomer coming?

25:55.822 --> 25:56.543
I think so.

25:56.783 --> 26:00.406
I think that as far as I know, Daddy and Wayne got along fine.

26:02.588 --> 26:07.693
Daddy saw it as an expanded role of what was happening.

26:07.793 --> 26:19.483
I don't think any of us at that point, Daddy might have, but I never heard it discussed, really interpreted that to be the expansion of a new

26:19.868 --> 26:26.997
role as far as A&M was concerned, a new type of student if you will.

26:27.998 --> 26:29.200
Nobody took it that way.

26:30.341 --> 26:34.426
Do you have any idea who it was that identified Wayne Stark to be selected for that?

26:34.446 --> 26:34.507
No.

26:34.527 --> 26:35.147
I do not know.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.012
Now you graduated from high school?

26:39.052 --> 26:40.174
49.

26:40.194 --> 26:40.955
Spring of 49.

26:42.817 --> 26:49.065
And describe the A&M consolidated high school.

26:50.041 --> 26:54.989
Well, they had about 150 students in the high school.

26:56.232 --> 26:58.035
The superintendent was Les Richardson.

27:00.399 --> 27:11.037
A little sidelight on that, I went out to the Cupper Awards at the business school the other day where they honored Gordon Bethune.

27:11.793 --> 27:15.178
and introduced myself, and he said, oh, I know all about you.

27:16.119 --> 27:17.421
And I said, why do you say that?

27:17.481 --> 27:22.388
And he said, well, my father-in-law was Les Richardson, which caught me by surprise.

27:22.468 --> 27:23.189
I didn't know that.

27:26.634 --> 27:28.757
The high school was small.

27:29.318 --> 27:33.263
It was beginning to grow, but we were a Class B school.

27:33.343 --> 27:39.592
We couldn't play Hearn, Madisonville, Navasota, or Caldwell because they were all too big for us.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.074
So who was in the district?

27:41.695 --> 27:53.808
Centerville, Iowa, Centerville, Somerville.

28:02.537 --> 28:03.558
Who else did we play?

28:03.638 --> 28:04.279
Love Lady.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.301
Was there a rival?

28:07.282 --> 28:10.926
Yeah, I think the big rival probably was Love Lady.

28:11.227 --> 28:14.351
And Calvert, Calvert was in the district.

28:14.951 --> 28:15.832
Well, they weren't in the district.

28:15.872 --> 28:17.935
We played Calvert for the bi-district one year.

28:19.417 --> 28:21.038
And your varsity sports were what?

28:21.239 --> 28:26.004
Football, basketball, baseball.

28:26.024 --> 28:28.267
And you played what positions?

28:28.287 --> 28:31.731
Quarterback, catcher, and guard.

28:33.933 --> 28:35.956
Catcher?

28:35.976 --> 28:37.858
Let me give you a Doak Walker story.

28:39.273 --> 28:47.583
His senior year in high school, the Highland Park Scotty catcher got hurt.

28:47.603 --> 28:57.335
The baseball coach needed a catcher badly, and the only athlete he thought was skillful enough to learn catching almost overnight was young Doak Walker.

28:57.976 --> 29:07.407
And he goes to talk to Doak's father, who was the associate superintendent of schools in Dallas in the DISD, who, by the way, had

29:07.673 --> 29:10.857
had known your dad real well at Austin College.

29:11.778 --> 29:23.772
And according to a story I heard, Dr. Walker told this coach, look, you're in charge, and if you think it'd be best for him to play catcher, fine.

29:24.553 --> 29:25.955
If he's willing to do that, that's fine.

29:25.975 --> 29:27.036
You're the head coach.

29:27.977 --> 29:36.567
And as they get to the door, Dr. Walker puts his arm around this man and said, and besides, if he's fool enough to put on that gear and kneel behind the batter,

29:36.766 --> 29:37.867
He ought to be a catcher.

29:39.349 --> 29:48.201
I remember Doak Walker coming to our house when he was solicited is not the right word.

29:49.623 --> 29:49.823
Recruited?

29:49.843 --> 29:51.145
Recruited by A&M.

29:51.866 --> 29:52.086
Oh, really?

29:52.107 --> 29:54.690
Yeah, and Doak came and spent the night at our house.

29:55.030 --> 29:57.394
Oh, describe your memory.

29:57.594 --> 30:03.702
Oh, I thought, you know, that he must be something wonderful because I remember sitting in the kitchen.

30:04.610 --> 30:10.518
while mom and daddy talked to Doak and some other people were there, but I don't remember who it was.

30:10.879 --> 30:13.022
I just remember he was there at the house.

30:13.062 --> 30:15.285
What kind of personality did he seem to have?

30:15.305 --> 30:17.468
Oh, he was a very enjoyable guy.

30:18.229 --> 30:18.950
Pleasant?

30:18.970 --> 30:19.791
Yeah, very pleasant.

30:19.811 --> 30:20.132
Courteous?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.373
Very pleasant, very courteous.

30:21.774 --> 30:22.475
Physically?

30:22.495 --> 30:25.680
He's a great athlete.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.280
No, but size?

30:26.821 --> 30:27.182
Small.

30:29.405 --> 30:30.847
What, 5'8", 5'9"?

30:30.867 --> 30:33.891
I'd say he's maybe a little taller than that, but basically small.

30:35.069 --> 30:37.172
Because for me, he was the hero of all heroes.

30:37.192 --> 30:40.117
Oh, I have to agree.

30:40.137 --> 30:40.318
Football.

30:40.338 --> 30:46.127
All right, in those years, in your senior year at high school, how did you all do in athletics?

30:46.207 --> 30:48.250
We won the baseball championship.

30:48.391 --> 30:50.915
We won district in football.

30:51.035 --> 30:53.499
And I think we were second in basketball.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.203
But in class B, that's as far as you can go.

30:56.324 --> 30:57.285
So that was the end of it.

30:57.525 --> 31:00.951
Who were your key teammates?

31:01.412 --> 31:02.173
Sonny Pruitt.

31:04.280 --> 31:25.765
Johnny Cooley, Homer Lamont, Lamar McNew, Dickie Dowell, Dick Birdwall was the manager.

31:33.693 --> 31:38.404
Let's see, who else?
