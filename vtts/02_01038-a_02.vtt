WEBVTT

00:04.688 --> 00:16.941
After the Curran faction called off the spring 
strike in 36, what did you and Curran do in the time

00:04.688 --> 00:16.941
before the fall strike was called? We kept making 
plans and making contacts with the seamen aboard

00:19.083 --> 00:32.637
the ship,

00:19.083 --> 00:32.637
getting them to join the organization. This still 
meaning the old ISU? No, this meant the new group,

00:36.855 --> 00:40.640
really. Well, we

00:41.561 --> 00:54.918
were trying to get, yes, we were trying to get these 
people active in the old ISU.

00:56.941 --> 01:04.210
I forget, I don't remember how long this went on, 
but at one point we had to break it off because while

01:05.236 --> 01:23.833
the rank-and-file took over the activities of the 
Union, the AFL

01:05.236 --> 01:23.833
did not recognize the rank-and-file groups. For 
example,

01:24.454 --> 01:34.163
there was a group controlling each one of these, 
the decks, stewards, and engine departments. a

01:35.628 --> 01:46.159
rank and file group controlling the actual 
meetings, but the old officials still control the

01:35.628 --> 01:46.159
money and the office. Why do you think at this time, 
particularly after the spring strike, that the

01:47.480 --> 01:59.032
upper echelons of the ISU didn't change their 
tune? Could they not recognize what was

01:59.513 --> 02:02.496
happening, or did they not care?

02:05.851 --> 02:10.336
Carlson, Grains, Charlsburg, this group? It's my 
own opinion and I can't prove this again that they

02:10.356 --> 02:17.203
were too close to the Steamship Company 
officials. During this time between the strikes

02:18.144 --> 02:22.308
did they ever come to you and ask for your help? No. 
No? No. I became an outcast really as far as they

02:25.431 --> 02:28.395
were concerned.

02:32.759 --> 02:33.580
Once the Really, I became an outcast when we had 
that strike aboard the U.S. line ships, the radio

02:33.931 --> 02:39.977
operators. I would have nothing more to do with 
them then. Were you at the famous

02:45.221 --> 02:53.709
Union-Cooper meeting? I was, indeed. Could you 
explain that, or describe that, please? Could you

03:00.495 --> 03:01.356
describe the meeting?

03:06.162 --> 03:07.784
Or the preparation that went into it? No, I can't. I 
don't remember the details of it. You don't

03:12.972 --> 03:27.314
remember if, well, when Turen made his entrance 
around 10 o'clock at night, had he been already

03:12.972 --> 03:27.314
tutored

03:12.972 --> 03:27.314
by someone to use the tactics that he did? Or was 
this a spontaneous outburst by the dissident

03:27.394 --> 03:35.646
members who were outside the Union? Well,

03:35.930 --> 03:47.140
Joe and I came into that meeting together, but I 
don't remember any of the details of it. I really

03:48.081 --> 03:48.722
don't. I just don't remember them.

03:53.787 --> 03:55.128
I can see the old building. I don't remember even 
how we came into that meeting now. When was it, or do

04:02.234 --> 04:03.996
you know, an approximate time when Curran and his 
group and your South decided that it was time to

04:04.246 --> 04:17.621
found a new union, that they actually gave up on the 
old ISU?

04:30.837 --> 04:33.780
I would say just before the 37th strike.

04:36.038 --> 04:37.439
It was perfectly clear. I don't remember the 
details of what went on now, but that group went to

04:40.002 --> 05:05.286
the AFL-CIO in Washington to visit with the Green 
about the conditions that existed in the three

04:40.002 --> 05:05.286
branches and the officials and how they were 
disregarding the wishes of the members. And the

05:06.363 --> 05:09.648
AFL, of course, said, no soap. They're the 
officials, and they put another man in charge. And

05:13.574 --> 05:14.997
I can't remember his name. You mentioned Hunter. 
That's not his name. Anyway, the AFL put another

05:20.846 --> 05:30.902
person in charge of the seafaring unions, not one 
of the old elected officials.

05:35.337 --> 05:41.866
And that person took the position of the old 
officials against the rank and file. I want to say

05:43.047 --> 05:44.048
Hunter. I think Hunter may have been his name, but 
I'm just not sure of that. But that'll show up

05:50.697 --> 05:54.081
somewhere in some of the stuff that you get into. 
Did you have anything to do with the curing groups

06:01.831 --> 06:05.736
activities as far as the Copeland Continuous 
Discharge book goes? I went with the group to

06:07.858 --> 06:10.201
Washington. Who organized this? Was this Kern or 
was this Patty Wayland? Who was the spearhead for

06:17.089 --> 06:19.993
this march on Washington? Joe Kern. Joe Kern was? 
Joe Kern was the spearhead for everything that

06:24.077 --> 06:27.501
took place. He was the leader. And as far as I was 
concerned, the important thing was to build him

06:31.548 --> 06:44.932
up, to make him the leader, because you can't take 
over a movement without a leader. And he was the

06:46.434 --> 06:48.838
natural person to do this. Did the Communists also 
recognize this? Oh yes, yes. They recognized this

06:52.906 --> 06:54.889
immediately. So in your opinion then during this 
time period there were two factions who were vying

06:55.004 --> 07:02.774
for Curran's ear?

07:05.738 --> 07:16.032
The basic rank and file and of course the 
Communists were trying to influence everything

07:05.738 --> 07:16.032
he did and they did influence him a lot. There's no 
question about that. They influenced me a lot.

07:21.700 --> 07:32.819
Fortunately, we both had enough understanding to 
realize that we didn't want

07:21.700 --> 07:32.819
communism.

07:35.203 --> 07:43.737
That was not what we were working for in these 
United States, and the thing we were working for

07:35.203 --> 07:43.737
with the seamen was literally to improve their 
conditions. We were not working to build a a

07:48.127 --> 07:52.533
communist government in the United States or a 
communist party in the United States. We were

07:53.334 --> 07:57.219
working to help seamen.

08:00.603 --> 08:07.312
And as far as I was concerned, the unlicensed 
seamen needed help just as bad as the radio

08:00.603 --> 08:07.312
operators did. And if the radio operators were 
ever going to get anywhere, you had to have all of

08:08.353 --> 08:13.780
the people on the ship organized.

08:16.932 --> 08:41.455
At this time when the rank and file was considering 
a national convention and before the National

08:16.932 --> 08:41.455
Maritime Union was named as such, did you and 
Curran and other groups ever approach John L.

08:16.932 --> 08:41.455
Lewis and his Committee for Industrial 
Organization before he actually founded the CIA?

08:42.903 --> 08:46.970
No, not until after it was formed.

08:50.195 --> 08:56.946
Do you have any idea where or from whom the name 
National Maritime Union came from? I don't

08:56.966 --> 08:57.648
remember. No, I really don't. I just don't 
remember.

09:07.237 --> 09:12.925
I don't remember whether we came up with that name 
before the convention or during the convention. I

09:12.985 --> 09:14.047
really don't remember. My main job during the 
convention was working on the Constitution, and I

09:16.170 --> 09:28.247
just don't remember the genesis of the National 
Maritime Union. Ed, you were on the

09:28.267 --> 09:30.650
Constitutional Committee. Yes. How influential 
was William Merrill's standard on this? What? How

09:35.457 --> 09:37.159
influential? in the writing of the Constitution 
was standard?

09:44.348 --> 09:46.090
I would say not very much. Not very much. Who 
actually put together most of the Constitution?

09:52.899 --> 09:54.441
Who was responsible for it? Myself and a 
communist. I can't think of his name. I can see him.

10:01.871 --> 10:02.012
Huh? Doyle? What? Doyle? No. No? No. He was a little 
slight man. He worked for the NMU after that as a

10:08.416 --> 10:12.742
researcher.

10:17.028 --> 10:17.509
I know him. I can see the man, but I can't think of his 
name. But he and I did most of the work on the

10:21.154 --> 10:23.757
Constitution. He was a communist at the time, and I 
knew he was a communist at the time. What was a,

10:30.787 --> 10:34.973
what was, What was the purpose of writing the 37th 
Constitution in such a way that it had so many

10:35.678 --> 10:47.896
democratic,

10:35.678 --> 10:47.896
or why was it such a democratic document? Was this 
purposely written into the amendments? Well, I

10:52.623 --> 11:03.019
guess it's because we got out the AFL-CIO, the AFL 
Constitution and the Declaration of

10:52.623 --> 11:03.019
Independence. And that's what we wrote the 
Constitution by. Were any of these amendments of

11:07.330 --> 11:21.048
it that were proposed written up specifically as a 
counterforce to the old ISU Constitution and the

11:07.330 --> 11:21.048
abuses that had been rendered under it? Our 
primary purpose in writing the Constitution was

11:22.270 --> 11:28.578
to give the membership control of the union. That 
was our primary objective in writing that

11:29.399 --> 11:32.803
Constitution. That was Joe's and my primary 
thing. Joe said that he wanted to come out of this

11:39.319 --> 11:45.969
with a constitution where the membership 
controlled the union. How much input did Curran

11:45.989 --> 11:52.238
have in the constitution before it was presented 
to the convention? Everything that we wrote, we

11:52.458 --> 11:54.982
checked with Joe. Everything. Who else looked at 
it beforehand, also for tacit approval? Bill

12:02.192 --> 12:03.955
Standard looked at it. He had very little to do with 
the original drafting. The final drafting, he had

12:12.440 --> 12:14.762
a lot to do with.

12:21.048 --> 12:23.130
Standard wasn't even in our meetings. Myself and 
this one guy, and I can't think of his name to save my

12:25.573 --> 12:33.621
life, and I've known him for all this time. I think 
he may be dead now, but I know he's not active in NMU.

12:41.238 --> 12:44.342
Tommy, first name was Tommy, I'll think of it. Not 
Ray? Tommy Ray. Tommy Ray? That's the man, Tommy

12:47.707 --> 12:49.409
Ray.

12:52.253 --> 12:59.222
He and I had

12:52.253 --> 12:59.222
most of the input into that Constitution. Why did 
you? And our sole purpose Joe and I had discussed

13:04.010 --> 13:12.342
this many times, and we had discussed it with the 
communists. This Roy Hudson, his name was. We

13:17.530 --> 13:18.771
discussed it with him. How about Al Lannan? Did he 
have much input at this time? None. None? None. Al

13:24.880 --> 13:27.023
Lannan came along much later. Much later. Tommy 
Ray, though, did have input into it. Whether

13:33.659 --> 13:38.586
Hudson had input into it through Ray, I don't know. 
I suspect he did, but I don't know. But in any event,

13:42.412 --> 13:52.107
Joe and I, in our discussion, we did not discuss any 
specific thing in the Constitution. We discussed

13:52.475 --> 13:54.638
only the principle. We wanted full and complete 
and final say and control of the membership.

14:01.848 --> 14:03.691
That's number one.

14:06.555 --> 14:10.180
So I dug out the AFL Constitution. I took our 
Constitution, of course, the ARTA, and the

14:10.281 --> 14:19.714
Declaration of Independence. Were the three 
major documents you used to put together? That was

14:23.819 --> 14:27.062
the three major documents, and that was what we 
worked for. And I remember that we did not want to

14:28.263 --> 14:40.796
use a very radical clause in the preamble of the AFL 
Constitution. There was a very radical clause in

14:41.416 --> 14:43.458
there. I can't remember now what it was. But 
anyway, we thought that was a little too

14:45.060 --> 14:49.144
communist.

14:50.575 --> 14:54.619
And it wasn't a communist document at all, of 
course. As far as the Constitution goes in the

14:54.639 --> 15:14.418
first part, why did you include, and this is what 
makes the document so famous, why did you include

14:54.639 --> 15:14.418
as a part of the membership no discrimination as to 
race, creed, and color? Was this felt to be

15:15.359 --> 15:18.102
important at the time? Yes, we felt it was 
important because we felt that as long as any one

15:18.402 --> 15:34.998
person wasn't free as a merchant seaman, as free as 
the others, no discrimination against them, no

15:18.402 --> 15:34.998
one was.

15:38.642 --> 15:45.709
It's a very basic fact that freedom flows

15:48.136 --> 15:49.938
from freedom of everyone. As long as you're not 
free to do something that I'm free to do, I'm not

15:51.200 --> 15:57.668
free to do that thing somewhere down the line. Why 
did the Union, almost from its inception, have

15:59.069 --> 16:09.242
such a liberal policy toward blacks?

16:09.962 --> 16:15.269
Wasn't this sort of a risky situation for the Union 
to take on at this time? Yes, it was. But again,

16:17.954 --> 16:24.403
black workers are competing against white 
workers for jobs. And these jobs, we felt that

16:26.366 --> 16:30.713
these jobs should be free for everyone. Was this 
prevalent in the industry at this time? No. I mean,

16:37.923 --> 16:41.048
the idea of black workers competing against white 
workers. No, it was very segregated. The only

16:45.359 --> 16:48.804
black workers in the industry were in the stewards 
department. They were segregated into that

16:48.864 --> 16:51.228
department. And...

16:56.215 --> 17:00.141
So then this clause wasn't put in the Constitution 
to, as a type of lip service. It was sincerely...

17:00.161 --> 17:14.843
No, it was put in there because we felt very 
strongly that you could not build a union which was

17:00.161 --> 17:14.843
controlled by the membership as long as you 
permitted discrimination against any person.

17:20.794 --> 17:28.464
Was there any one person who was insistent on the 
race clause being included there in the

17:20.794 --> 17:28.464
membership requirements? More or less, was there 
anyone who really pressed this issue strongly?

17:34.131 --> 17:37.255
The communist faction or the rank-and-file 
faction or an individual? Well, I would say that

17:37.275 --> 17:42.822
Joe and I pressed the faction, but the communists 
also pressed it. So there was no argument over

17:44.489 --> 17:46.072
that? It was just agreement? No, there was never 
any argument over that issue when the

17:48.956 --> 17:54.265
organization was set up. There became some 
arguments over it later on. But fortunately,

17:58.131 --> 18:11.172
I've been fortunate enough to locate some 
material by an economist called Van Mises, Von

18:11.422 --> 18:14.586
Mises, did you ever hear of him? Ludwig Von Mises. 
He's from the Austrian School of Economics.

18:23.738 --> 18:32.088
I would say after Adam Smith, he was probably the 
greatest economist that ever existed.

18:34.612 --> 18:40.399
And one thing that he did in his work, particularly 
that dealing with human action was to emphasize

18:41.864 --> 18:53.135
how you maintain freedom.

18:55.337 --> 18:58.520
He dwelt on this considerably. Fortunately, I was 
able to have

18:59.762 --> 19:11.533
been subjected to some of his writings.

19:14.163 --> 19:19.268
He takes the whole thing of freedom back to free 
enterprise, where it really begins. Unless

19:20.630 --> 19:25.875
businesses are free, workers can't be free. 
Unless workers are free, business can't be free.

19:30.820 --> 19:39.649
And he tied these two together in such simple terms 
and simple examples that even I could understand

19:30.820 --> 19:39.649
them. And he influenced you then? He definitely 
did influence me. And he was, of course, a strong

19:44.740 --> 19:48.285
anti-communist. And he also wrote some material 
on why socialism can't exist, why business has to

19:48.926 --> 19:59.099
be free. And of course, he dealt with the fact that 
businesses are too stupid to really maintain

20:09.479 --> 20:24.221
their freedom because they take every 
opportunity they can to reach into the government

20:09.479 --> 20:24.221
tills and avoid being free instead of really 
working for free enterprise like they should. But

20:26.064 --> 20:30.070
that definitely influenced me.

20:34.268 --> 20:34.849
I don't know. Joe had no background on this except, 
I guess, hard experience, and he just said,

20:35.530 --> 20:47.989
right from the very first, he said, I don't see 
colors.

20:50.694 --> 20:57.364
If the fellow happens to be sitting across from me 
and happens to be black or yellow, I don't see his

20:50.694 --> 20:57.364
color, I see the man. And that was always his 
position. And one thing that a Negro had better

21:01.370 --> 21:15.725
understand about Joe Curran in the union is that 
you don't come in talking to him about

21:01.370 --> 21:15.725
discrimination going on in the union from his 
office. If a man came in with a legitimate

21:15.745 --> 21:31.242
complaint about an agent or anyone else 
discriminating against him, he got full hearing,

21:15.745 --> 21:31.242
of course, and showed me where he did it. But I was in 
Joe's office once when a Negro came in and started

21:32.538 --> 21:41.368
ranting and inferred that Joe was 
discriminating. Joe just got up out of his chair

21:42.430 --> 21:48.877
and went over and got him by the collar and by the 
seat of the pants and moved him out the door, said,

21:42.430 --> 21:48.877
don't ever come back.

21:52.281 --> 21:54.343
Joe literally did not see colors.

21:57.547 --> 22:00.891
It just was not in him to discriminate against 
anybody. After the convention and the

22:02.339 --> 22:09.490
Constitution,

22:02.339 --> 22:09.490
who did you go to for national affiliation? Did you 
go to Green first in the AFL or directly to Lewis and

22:09.651 --> 22:17.123
the CIO? The organization never went back to 
Green, as I remember. And they were never courted

22:22.631 --> 22:24.014
by Green? Never what? Courted? No. I don't think 
so. If they were, I don't remember it. After the

22:32.022 --> 22:37.811
convention and the Constitution, how is your 
relationship with the Union? Are you still a

22:38.472 --> 22:46.044
president of the ARTA, or have you dropped this 
affiliation in ? I dropped the affiliation of the

22:46.404 --> 22:52.153
ARTA when I didn't run again for president. But how 
do you mean? Am I a member of the ARTA or the NMU or

22:54.137 --> 22:57.702
what? Right. I'm a member of both of them. member of 
both of the unions. I'm an honorary lab member of

23:01.718 --> 23:08.587
both of them. But I never joined the NMU. This was a 
convention

23:11.951 --> 23:19.060
action that made me honorary lab member. But your 
activities then would be specifically with the

23:19.300 --> 23:26.069
NMU after the convention and the Constitution, as 
far as your employment and? No, I was never

23:27.371 --> 23:29.333
employed by the NMU. Or you would be strictly in an 
advisory? When I left the ARTA, I took a six months

23:35.024 --> 23:41.834
leave. In other words, I just didn't do anything. 
It was my intention not to do anything for six

23:48.685 --> 23:51.148
months. At the end of the first month, I couldn't 
sit still. I had to find a job. So my wife said, well,

24:00.160 --> 24:05.668
why don't you just take another month before you 
start looking? So I said, well, I can't stand it.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.964
But anyway, I went for three months before I 
started looking. And the first man I went to gave me

24:17.586 --> 24:21.111
a job. So I went to Standard Oil of New Jersey, a 
fellow by the name of Hague. And the reason I went to

24:27.781 --> 24:29.644
him was, Because of my knowledge of him as being 
president of the ARTA, I saw how he worked amongst

24:30.299 --> 24:40.597
the ship owners. And he was the leader of that 
group. And almost anything he said went. What time

24:46.406 --> 24:49.732
would this be? Oh, this was 19, it would be 19,

24:56.033 --> 24:57.935
from about 1937. I think

24:58.216 --> 25:06.726
I left in 1937. I don't remember now the date.

25:17.018 --> 25:25.888
Well, anyway, while I was still president of the 
ARTA, I went to meetings of ship owners, you know,

25:17.018 --> 25:25.888
between ship owners and the unions. And he was the 
basic leader of the group. So I went to him and told

25:30.730 --> 25:34.836
him that I was looking for a job. He had one that I 
wanted. He said, you've got it. What is it? I told

25:41.886 --> 25:46.332
him what I wanted to do was to head up their radio 
department. He said, fine. I never did one thing in

25:50.158 --> 25:55.285
the radio department, not one thing. He said, 
well, the first thing I want you to do is to make a

25:56.547 --> 26:06.537
trip around the country to all of our offices and to 
all of our ships that happen to be in port. I want you

26:08.238 --> 26:21.751
to look at the conditions that exist, talk with the 
people in these offices and see what they think of

26:08.238 --> 26:21.751
the conditions that exist on the ships, whether or 
not changes should be made and so forth. Come back

26:23.113 --> 26:24.394
and report to me. Then we will get down to your 
specific assignment." I came back and reported to

26:30.475 --> 26:34.740
him, told him what I thought ought to be done. He 
says, it'll be done. I had men put on the ship to make

26:38.804 --> 26:43.329
surveys that I outlined as to what they should do. 
This is after the NMU is founded? Beg your pardon?

26:48.275 --> 26:50.897
This is after the NMU is founded? This was after the 
NMU was founded, yes. What was your reaction in

26:54.344 --> 27:05.338
Standard Oils, and I guess the NMUs, to Lundberg's 
founding of the SIU in 1938?

27:08.723 --> 27:12.007
Well, we knew that it was founded by the ship 
owners.

27:15.752 --> 27:21.820
And of course, I learned specifically yes that it 
was when I got into Standard Oil. The main

27:24.466 --> 27:37.082
supporter was Eastern Steamship Company then, 
and there was one other, Isthmian Line, U.S.

27:24.466 --> 27:37.082
Steel. They were the ones who really paid for it. 
They footed the bills.

27:51.753 --> 27:55.698
Did Curran try to seek Lundberg's help out, or did 
he ever? He did. And what was the result of

27:56.980 --> 28:14.644
that? My own analysis at the time was that Lundberg 
was a very insecure person.

28:26.367 --> 28:33.736
And he saw in Joe Curran

28:26.367 --> 28:33.736
the growth of a very dynamic leader. And I think, I 
still think this was the problem. What about Harry

28:41.826 --> 28:43.849
Bridges?

28:48.132 --> 28:50.835
Harry Bridges was interested in two things.

28:54.218 --> 29:01.686
Advancing the Communist Party

28:54.218 --> 29:01.686
and keeping Harry Bridges in charge.

29:04.649 --> 29:11.896
So is it your opinion then that, or do you think that 
Curran was a Communist Party member? Curran?

29:12.657 --> 29:13.938
Excuse me, Bridges. Yes, I know he was. Well, I 
don't know it. He said he was. He told you then? Oh,

29:21.181 --> 29:21.662
yes. He made no bones of it amongst the people he 
knew.

29:29.975 --> 29:35.503
What about, could we move on to the 1939 per se? It 
seems to be a very important year as far as the

29:35.683 --> 29:41.792
National Maritime Union goes. Specifically, Do 
you have any thoughts or any recollections of the

29:46.840 --> 29:53.628
Mariners Club?

29:53.648 --> 29:56.832
No, just generally basically what they tried to 
do. You say the 1939, you're talking about the

29:58.254 --> 30:01.158
convention? Well, and the tanker strike, the 
convention, the Mariners Club, the five points

30:01.899 --> 30:08.026
program. At this time you were employed by 
Standard Oil? 1939, yes, I was with Standard Oil.

30:15.342 --> 30:18.647
And so your affiliation, you weren't that close to 
Nicaran? I was always very close to Curran. And in

30:22.953 --> 30:24.576
an advisory capacity? Or more as a friend? More as a 
friend. He would discuss with me problems when he

30:29.143 --> 30:33.229
wanted my advice. Okay. Tuning in then on the 
tanker strike of 39, first of all, why do you think

30:37.280 --> 30:42.146
it came about? And what was Kieran's stand on the 
strike?

30:47.373 --> 30:51.298
I think it came about because of stupidity of the 
Communist Party. The Communists were in strong

30:53.501 --> 30:56.244
position in the NMU. There were more Communist 
officials in the NMU than there were

30:56.344 --> 31:03.053
non-Communists.

31:03.073 --> 31:07.118
And they forced the strike because of, I think, 
stupidity.

31:09.899 --> 31:19.449
Again, Tommy Ray played, tried to play a very 
important part in that thing. He tried to prevent

31:19.509 --> 31:21.451
that strike. He told them. Matter of fact, he told 
me just exactly what would happen. I didn't think

31:29.379 --> 31:30.921
it would happen that way. I was still with Standard 
Oil. He said, the strike will take place, the

31:34.688 --> 31:45.789
people will pile off the ships, and the company 
will have the ships manned, and there'll be very

31:34.688 --> 31:45.789
few, if any, delays in it. And the strike will be 
lost, and we'll lose our contract in this company.

31:52.201 --> 31:55.667
And I said, well, I agree with you that you're going 
to lose the contract. But I didn't think that you

31:56.423 --> 32:01.549
would get the seamen to pile off. I thought they 
would stay aboard the Standard Oil or New Jersey

32:01.689 --> 32:04.852
ships. Anyway, the rest of the Communist Party and 
Joe said that we just, I guess we just have to have

32:05.633 --> 32:14.403
the strike. I don't see any way we can prevent it. So 
he wasn't in favor of the strike? He was not in favor

32:18.888 --> 32:23.914
of it because he'd already worked out an agreement 
with the company. The agreement was that the

32:26.849 --> 32:34.981
Instead of, the

32:26.849 --> 32:34.981
real fight was over the Union Hall, shipping 
through the Union Hall. So he had worked out an

32:35.902 --> 32:52.165
agreement with Haig that the company would call 
the Union Hall and the seaman then would go

32:35.902 --> 32:52.165
directly to the company's office and from that 
company's office to the ship. The Union didn't

32:52.837 --> 32:54.038
want that. The communists didn't want that. They 
wanted the man to go direct from the Union to the

32:55.359 --> 33:00.704
ship instead of the company. Why do you think 
Standard Oil took that position? What? Why did

33:03.387 --> 33:07.050
Standard Oil take that position? Because this was 
a procedure that they had always followed. This

33:12.355 --> 33:15.138
was where their records for the seamen started 
out. And when the seamen came ashore from the ship,

33:15.898 --> 33:20.903
that's where their records were kept. And this was 
the way they operated. Now, they could have moved

33:23.988 --> 33:29.016
that office over to Bayonne, where the ship was. 
But if the ship goes somewhere else, the man would

33:29.657 --> 33:33.322
have to go to Bayonne. They had determined that 
this was the most centralized part to handle it. It

33:39.210 --> 33:40.092
wasn't uptown. It was downtown, where it was 
handed to the seamen. And Joe recognized this. And

33:46.981 --> 33:50.907
that's why he agreed to this particular thing. 
Once the 39th strike started, what was Standard

33:52.034 --> 33:58.063
Oil's position? Did they want to break the strike 
then, or did they want to continue relations? No,

34:02.208 --> 34:02.929
no. They said that

34:03.130 --> 34:13.785
we offered the Union what we considered to be a fair 
situation.

34:16.328 --> 34:18.852
Joe considered it to be a fair situation. You 
approved of it as being a fair situation to me.

34:26.944 --> 34:28.165
And we won't accept less. If that means tying up our 
ships for months, we'll tie them up for months.

34:37.477 --> 34:38.118
It's that simple. Once the strike started, that 
was it. They would have no more use for a national

34:39.539 --> 34:42.002
union? No. The Union will not back up its leader. We 
can't back up its leader, and we're not going to buy

34:48.329 --> 34:51.233
the leader.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.200
Do you think at any time Standard Oil would have 
wanted to force the strike? No, not at that time.

34:59.323 --> 35:01.226
They would have been happy with the contract. They 
were happy with it. Yes. I would say that there were

35:04.670 --> 35:15.484
some people in Standard Oil who were not happy with 
it, but Bob Haig was head of the Marine Department,

35:04.670 --> 35:15.484
and he was happy with it, and that's what counted. 
Didn't Haig die during the strike? No, he died in

35:22.298 --> 35:24.801
1940. I

35:24.841 --> 35:30.207
think it was 1940. I may be wrong. He may have died 
during that strike, but I don't believe he did. Why

35:36.475 --> 35:39.759
do you think the Union lost the strike? Because 
they called it. They just didn't have the

35:41.681 --> 35:44.104
resources? No, they didn't have the resources, 
didn't have the ability to fight Standard Oil.

35:50.705 --> 35:57.534
They had no access to the plant where the ships 
dock.

35:57.554 --> 36:06.666
Standard Oil had a ship with it, would bring strike 
breakers aboard and house them on that ship, feed

35:57.554 --> 36:06.666
them on that ship, ship, another ship come in and 
take them right off of it and put it on it.

36:11.473 --> 36:14.817
I'd like to mention some names and if you had any 
comments on them as our insights on them um

36:16.028 --> 36:42.846
ferdinand smith how important was he in the union 
ferdinand smith was an incompetent ass he was put

36:16.028 --> 36:42.846
in the position solely because he was a negro and 
the most prominent negro in the group by whom who

36:16.028 --> 36:42.846
placed him now who supported him joe supported him 
Did Smith play any large part in the Union's

36:44.480 --> 36:51.648
desegregation stand? No, he did not. He was a 
figurehead? He was a pure figurehead. He had no

36:55.813 --> 36:57.535
ability or no nothing. He was really an impediment 
to the Union's growth, his incompetence.

37:07.286 --> 37:09.368
Could you give some examples of that, or what are 
you feeling? Well, it was just general

37:09.769 --> 37:11.871
incompetence. He really had no expertise in 
anything. As Secretary of Treasury, he couldn't

37:17.187 --> 37:24.456
write a letter, he couldn't make a financial 
statement, he couldn't do anything. Why did the

37:26.178 --> 37:29.182
party push him then? Well, there was no one else to 
push. And they felt they needed a black... They

37:34.849 --> 37:36.511
felt they needed a black person. What about 
Blackie Myers?

37:42.985 --> 37:53.197
Black and Myers had a great personality,

37:42.985 --> 37:53.197
but that really is all he had, too, was 
personality.

37:57.202 --> 38:03.950
He really had no competence handling business in 
the organization, but the seamen liked him. He was

38:04.490 --> 38:06.733
well liked by the seamen. Did he have much input 
with Joe? Well, of course, he would talk to Joe

38:10.964 --> 38:15.170
about anything and everything that he wanted to. 
But when it came down to really coming up with

38:15.992 --> 38:23.343
important decisions, he just wasn't there. He 
didn't have that kind of ability. He could, for

38:28.170 --> 38:39.688
example, if it was routine matters of settling 
beefs on a ship that a seaman had, he could do that.

38:40.563 --> 38:44.870
And he normally did not do it by referring to the 
agreement. He did it through his personality,

38:45.771 --> 38:49.637
pure and simple. And he could get a seaman to do 
almost anything. So he was a type of dynamic

38:53.504 --> 38:58.071
personality like Joe Kern as far as the rank and 
following. Yes, he was. He was a very personable,

38:58.912 --> 39:02.698
very personable person. What about Jack 
Lawrenson?

39:08.508 --> 39:16.099
Jack Lawrenson at that time was the best educated 
of the seafaring group in the leadership.

39:20.905 --> 39:22.928
But he had some problems. Drinking being one. The 
other one wanting to work at night instead of in the

39:25.712 --> 39:28.836
daytime.

39:33.323 --> 39:35.005
Another one chasing girls. Not that I'm against 
any of these things, understand, but he put them

39:36.706 --> 39:41.271
ahead of work. Don't let work interfere with my 
pleasure.

39:46.137 --> 39:55.608
But as far as actual academic training, he was by 
far ahead of any of us. How did Myers and Smith and

39:57.050 --> 40:04.198
Lawrenson, how did they get into the upper 
brackets of the leadership in the union? Well, I

40:06.929 --> 40:11.333
think basically because of Communist Party 
support.

40:13.916 --> 40:16.278
Figureheads, or were they the driving force? Or 
was there someone behind pushing them up? I don't

40:20.843 --> 40:22.405
know, really. But I think the party is the one who 
got them to run. This I don't know. But I think

40:28.831 --> 40:35.738
knowing as much as I do about the party, I would 
assume. that this is the way it happened, but I

40:36.089 --> 40:40.496
don't know that. M.

40:40.896 --> 40:57.422
Headley Stone came from a Great Lakes ship,

40:40.896 --> 40:57.422
and he worked himself up through the by being 
active on the lakes and then coming into

40:58.415 --> 41:02.921
headquarters. I don't know how he was brought into 
headquarters. I don't remember.

41:09.469 --> 41:10.871
I should, but I don't. I just don't remember. But 
Headley was an able person.

41:22.165 --> 41:27.932
He, when an idea was, he was good on raising ideas. 
He was a thinking person. He was an idea person, and

41:29.594 --> 41:40.605
he would come up with ideas, and he had good 
positions when he came up with them, and if you came

41:29.594 --> 41:40.605
up with ideas, he had good positions on them. He was 
an able person, but he had family problems that

41:40.685 --> 41:47.191
ruined his career.

41:50.294 --> 41:53.717
Excuse me, what about Neil Hanley? Neil Hanley. I 
would say that Neal was just a... I don't really

42:00.825 --> 42:07.194
know how Neal Hanley ever got elected to anything, 
really. Joe Stack? Joe Stack was a party hack.

42:17.728 --> 42:25.138
He had some personality traits that helped him, I 
think, but that's about all.

42:27.312 --> 42:29.174
when he and Joe had the showdown. It was one vote 
apart.

42:35.740 --> 42:38.403
Have you had any input on that situation? Just 
other than reading the minutes of the convention.

42:44.850 --> 42:51.036
Well, at the convention, I don't remember what the 
issue was now. Do you recall what the issue was from

42:52.217 --> 42:56.121
reading?

42:58.480 --> 43:05.128
Procedurally, in the convention, I believe, it 
was the first time that Statt challenged his

42:58.480 --> 43:05.128
curing. Well, anyway, whatever it was. Wasn't 
there also a wage dispute or contract at the time? I

43:11.717 --> 43:12.838
don't remember the issue. I don't remember what it 
was. But the party guys lined up against Joe. And

43:20.992 --> 43:26.598
Joe went down the line of the guys who were leading 
from the floor, the party guys. They were well

43:26.618 --> 43:30.082
planted on that floor. And he referred to each one 
of them. One of the guys tried to be an actor and

43:33.545 --> 43:37.610
failed. And he said, part-time actor, so-and-so, 
this is his position. Joe then went on around all of

43:42.054 --> 43:44.697
them. And Joe stacked, this is his position. My 
position is a very, very simple one. I'm

43:52.396 --> 43:55.621
interested in the seamen and interested in the 
Union. I'm not interested in the Communist Party

43:56.963 --> 43:59.446
as such. I have never fought the Communist Party in 
this Union, as long as they fought for issues that

44:01.329 --> 44:08.779
would help the seamen. I've understood all along 
that their only interest in building this Union is

44:10.021 --> 44:17.732
to build a power base for themselves. I've never 
stood in their way to do that as long as they worked

44:22.163 --> 44:25.808
for the betterment of the union. But anyway, when 
it was all over, and I'll never understand this in

44:25.828 --> 44:34.500
my life, why the party let it happen. The Honest 
Ballot Association counted the ballots, and

44:34.520 --> 44:41.549
there was one vote difference. Curran won by one 
vote. And not a one of those party guys asked for a

44:44.874 --> 44:47.918
recount. Most stupid thing, Joe and I talked about 
that for a long time after he got away with it. I was

44:56.906 --> 45:03.933
still with Standard Oil at the time, but I happened 
to be at the convention. How long did you stay

45:03.953 --> 45:06.256
affiliated with Standard Oil? I left there at the 
end of 1940. 1940? No.

45:14.144 --> 45:15.064
Maybe it was 1939. It was 1939 I left.

45:21.445 --> 45:23.428
left Standard Oil. So, so Haig would have had to die 
in 39. I went with the Actors Union in 1940, and

45:26.372 --> 45:34.424
I left there. I was, I took, I signed a one-year 
contract with the Actors Union, and that was in

45:34.484 --> 45:48.043
1940 sometime, and I left there in 1941 sometime. 
Did you go back to NMU then? No. When I left there, I

45:51.182 --> 45:54.000
set up
