WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:32.468
Bulldog Rangers and I'm serious President Rudder 
had a real strong affinity for that dog and you know

00:02.866 --> 00:32.468
he was a bulldog a ranger and that's where he got his 
name he was a ranger so we retrieved the old dog and I

00:02.866 --> 00:32.468
guess I was the one that called the physical plant I 
said we're gonna have a burial for the Bulldog and

00:02.866 --> 00:32.468
we need a little maroon and white wooden coffin and 
And we got him to dig a hole over here. Do you know

00:35.878 --> 00:36.900
where he's buried? Right over here, not far from 
the sidewalk. In front of the house. West of the

00:41.465 --> 00:42.326
house. I mean, excuse me, east. And we had a little 
ceremony. The public was not invited. Had buried

00:50.416 --> 00:55.863
Ranger.

00:55.883 --> 01:00.449
And it was more emotional than I dreamed that it 
would be. When... When Mr. Rutter had a meeting

01:02.333 --> 01:23.447
with the

01:02.333 --> 01:23.447
administrators that reported directly to him, 
the vice presidents and so forth, we met every, we

01:02.333 --> 01:23.447
called it the executive committee, and we, what 
was it, every Monday?

01:27.224 --> 01:46.279
seems like it was uh like 10 in the morning every 
monday i think and he presided that's correct how

01:27.224 --> 01:46.279
uh inclined was he to hear their candid opinions at 
that meeting i guess it depended on the uh

01:53.903 --> 01:59.193
on the subject and whether he had already made up 
his mind about the way we should move. He would very

02:01.818 --> 02:11.676
quickly let them at least sense the direction that 
he thought we should move. and then introduce them

02:13.310 --> 02:16.715
and ask for their opinion. So you would kind of 
plant the seed, I think. And there were probably

02:19.820 --> 02:24.127
calls before most meetings, discussions. And the 
one that he always remembered, the person of that

02:24.308 --> 02:38.170
group, deans and vice presidents and so forth, the 
one that he always admired was Fred Benson. and I

02:39.567 --> 03:02.807
saw I think I saw or at least I know but I think I saw it 
Fred got so mad one day that he walked out of the

02:39.567 --> 03:02.807
meeting I have no recollection of what it was about 
but he lost his temper and instead of exploding he

02:39.567 --> 03:02.807
just said y'all gonna have to excuse me and he 
walked out but people were all given a he gave

03:03.614 --> 03:24.390
everybody a chance to say something he'd go round 
robin you know after the business of the day what's

03:03.614 --> 03:24.390
going on over there here there and yonder but uh 
people he was not hard to read and people could

03:03.614 --> 03:24.390
pretty well figure out what in advance what he 
thought would be the best answer. And of course you

03:26.630 --> 03:33.188
get to know how he thinks and you can predict what 
you think that he would think. And enough people

03:34.050 --> 03:36.878
were afraid of him that they wouldn't say what they 
really felt sometimes was it better for one of

03:37.634 --> 04:04.772
those key administrators to speak to him 
one-on-one if they were in disagreement with his

03:37.634 --> 04:04.772
first judgment was it better for them to speak to 
him one-on-one than it was to speak at that staff

03:37.634 --> 04:04.772
meeting yes yeah i would say that's the case yeah it 
goes back to his he

04:06.085 --> 04:33.797
had enough general in him that he really thought it 
was the wrong thing to do to publicly

04:06.085 --> 04:33.797
debate or disagree he didn't like public debate I 
think he would listen to anybody on anything as

04:06.085 --> 04:33.797
long as others weren't there to hear what was 
transcribing and uh like i say i i i don't remember

04:34.418 --> 05:00.527
him ever losing his temper i believe you could say 
what you wanted to but the the press damn sure

04:34.418 --> 05:00.527
better not be there or someone that might report it 
and he would much prefer a one-on-one than i do you

04:34.418 --> 05:00.527
remember any occasions when you persuaded him to 
change his mind on a point Not on big things like

05:01.418 --> 05:04.262
coeducation. No. Little things.

05:09.629 --> 05:17.540
Kurt Ergalik, chemistry,

05:09.629 --> 05:17.540
was the coach of the soccer team. He's from 
Austria, I think. And he came to the president's

05:21.385 --> 05:26.752
office, and he said, he got an audience. He said, 
President Rutter, he said, We've been pushed all

05:31.304 --> 05:39.714
over this campus, and now they tell us that we can't 
play on the drill field, and we can't play here or

05:31.304 --> 05:39.714
play there. If the weather is this way, we can't. He 
says, if we took care of it, he said, could you have

05:41.256 --> 05:57.035
somebody find us a permanent place to play soccer, 
and it has to be somewhere close to DeWare

05:41.256 --> 05:57.035
Fieldhouse so we can take a shower and change 
clothes. And so he came in and introduced me to Dr.

05:57.055 --> 06:01.260
Ergolick there in my office, and he said, get the 
maps out, get with Shorty Parsons, and find this

06:02.000 --> 06:06.966
man a place to play soccer. And I sat with Kurt, and I 
said, how big does a soccer field have to be? What

06:11.151 --> 06:13.134
are the dimensions of a soccer field? And he said, 
well, it's variable. He said it doesn't, I mean,

06:17.119 --> 06:20.143
you can make it longer or shorter. There's some, 
it's not all that critical. I guess it is in World

06:22.425 --> 06:25.209
Cup, but not this. And we had decided that this area 
right here, right there, uh right to the right of

06:32.172 --> 06:40.427
that sidewalk there though it was a little unlevel 
he said that that would be a great place we can see

06:32.172 --> 06:40.427
the field house and So I took the map, the plat into 
him, and I said, this is where we think it ought to

06:41.302 --> 06:45.907
be. It's perfect. And he said, he had this map. He 
said, what is that in the middle of the field? I

06:52.774 --> 06:55.096
said, well, that's a damned old mesquite tree. He 
said, don't say damned old mesquite tree. He says,

06:58.099 --> 06:59.181
where I come from? He said, that's a tree. He said, 
are you talking about they can't play around that

07:02.744 --> 07:05.707
tree? I said, no, sir. Somebody would run into it 
and get killed. or badly injured, I said, if the

07:11.440 --> 07:19.009
tree doesn't go, we can't play this field because 
it's right in the middle. He said, no, go find

07:19.830 --> 07:21.492
another place. And I did that three times. And 
finally he came in the office one day and he said,

07:27.159 --> 07:31.545
did you ever find old Ergolic, that soccer field? I 
said, no, sir. I said, there isn't one except where

07:34.588 --> 07:38.393
that old mesquite tree is. He said, are you really 
serious about that? I said, that's right. I said,

07:46.325 --> 07:53.414
President Rutter, there is not a human on this 
campus that knows that tree's there except you. I

07:55.597 --> 08:00.203
said, we can, I mean, we spend lots of money 
planting trees here. We can do without that one old

08:00.223 --> 08:01.965
mosquito. He said, you have to understand, you 
know, I had the driveway changed so it wouldn't

08:01.985 --> 08:08.734
tear down those two mosquitos that are over there 
right now by the entryway. He had the whole thing

08:09.845 --> 08:13.570
moved, redesigned. And he said, you talk with 
Shorty Parsons, and after dark some night, he

08:15.673 --> 08:25.927
said, have that tree cut down, and I want it 
resodded. He said, I don't want to be a trace of that

08:25.947 --> 08:29.351
tree was removed. And that's what happened, and we 
played soccer out here. Here's what he would do. on

08:37.520 --> 08:45.531
something like this or sometimes bigger things, I 
would say, well, what do you think about this

08:37.520 --> 08:45.531
approach? No, no, no, that's not going to work. And 
about a week later, he'd come in and he'd say, what

08:50.258 --> 08:54.104
did you find out about? I said, well, don't you 
remember? Our best thought was this or that, and

08:57.188 --> 09:01.194
you vetoed that. So I'm just letting it just sit on 
the back. and he'd usually on the third time he'd

09:06.173 --> 09:28.840
come in and say cooper get that tree cut down or 
whatever it was but he really thought things out

09:06.173 --> 09:28.840
and he knew that ecology was a big thing in the minds 
of people as it was when dr williams was there the

09:06.173 --> 09:28.840
green phase that we went through and he wasn't 
about to get ridiculed in the paper for destroying

09:29.866 --> 09:35.377
some of God's creation right here in the middle of 
campus. That's the way he thought of it. Which of

09:38.062 --> 09:52.870
the vice presidents and other key people that 
reported to him, you mentioned Benson, which

09:38.062 --> 09:52.870
others, I'm only going to ask the positive, not the 
negative, which others did he most trust to give

09:38.062 --> 09:52.870
him good advice?

10:02.823 --> 10:09.189
He, I think, had high regard for Wayne Hall. There 
were some unfortunate things that you know about

10:09.269 --> 10:15.575
that happened within the family at other times. 
But I think he had regard for him.

10:23.782 --> 10:32.610
He thought one of his crowning achievements was 
bringing in a man from Columbia, namely Ed

10:33.552 --> 10:36.056
Romanek, isn't that where he came from, Columbia? 
I think so. I believe it was Columbia. It was his

10:38.781 --> 10:52.725
thought that this was the first breakthrough in 
bringing in a renowned

10:38.781 --> 10:52.725
specialist in a field as a dean. And one of his real 
pet projects was to, you know, he coined the word

10:53.870 --> 11:00.959
excellence. We want excellence at every level. 
And though he made a couple of mistakes with

11:03.862 --> 11:23.286
personnel, he really thought Ed Romanek was the 
breakthrough on bringing people with

11:03.862 --> 11:23.286
that kind of a reputation in. top quality that 
would be recognized turns out that ed had some

11:24.278 --> 11:42.304
strange little quirks but but that was that was his 
he really thought that was his first move towards

11:24.278 --> 11:42.304
excellence in faculty and then a couple more that 
were brought It didn't pan out too well, but he

11:43.246 --> 11:59.390
really, I think, was disappointed often in the 
eccentricities of people of excellence. He

11:59.410 --> 12:00.792
doesn't understand that. They're not military 
people. They don't think in that way. They're free

12:04.478 --> 12:10.587
spirits, and he always had a hard time 
understanding free spirits. Now, in fiscal

12:11.343 --> 12:16.582
matters, he had great trust in Tom Cherry and Clark 
Diebel. Clark Diebel particularly. Diebel in

12:18.429 --> 12:22.022
particular because he was in the land office. He 
was in charge of all the... uh... the book work over

12:23.982 --> 12:44.370
there and he was a good well they wasn't too wild 
about they'd been through german people

12:23.982 --> 12:44.370
particularly but dewa was one he liked they'd been 
through the courtroom stress of that uh...

12:23.982 --> 12:44.370
cleaning up that mess over there and jim lindsey of 
course he brought in because he had been his PR

12:45.025 --> 12:48.369
person, his press agent in the military. And he 
brought him in and and he brought in Jim Hannigan in

12:49.771 --> 12:59.664
Student Affairs because he was he was a military 
background. And he brought in Shorty Parsons into

12:59.764 --> 13:04.590
the physical plant because he had a military. His 
first assistant, Dorsey McCrory, was a colonel.

13:07.894 --> 13:11.539
And so he was openly at the non-academic level, he 
wanted military background people. And I think

13:18.809 --> 13:20.415
that was part of Why he liked me is because I was a 
tank platoon leader, which is about as mean and

13:21.138 --> 13:29.574
nasty as it gets. Now, I have heard, see if you have 
heard this anecdote. I've heard that when the

13:32.379 --> 13:43.180
aspirations report first came in with 
recommendations on the changes of coeducation,

13:32.379 --> 13:43.180
voluntary corps, integration, and so forth, that 
he was taken aback by all that was in there, that he

13:44.459 --> 13:58.894
called the deans in, fussed at them, and that they 
tried to make excuses except for Fred Benson. Do

13:58.975 --> 14:02.118
you know anything about that session? Not that 
specifically, but the part that I do remember is

14:02.979 --> 14:14.331
the blueprint for progress was the working 
blueprints to implement the study that had been

14:15.678 --> 14:16.959
done. Isn't that right? Right. And I'll tell you 
what he really thought was that it was way out of

14:19.181 --> 14:28.431
line in terms of what it would cost. Honestly, I 
think that was it. Because it did call for some

14:33.296 --> 14:35.258
sweeping. You're talking about library,

14:37.079 --> 14:42.144
classroom facilities. We're talking about mega 
dollars. And that scared him. It really did scare

14:48.070 --> 14:50.316
him. I don't think he was as mad as he was scared of 
what it was going to cost. He didn't think it was

14:54.646 --> 14:56.350
that much money in the world. Because the story I 
heard about that session with the deans was that

14:58.844 --> 15:11.942
Benson was the last one to speak up, that the others 
had made excuses, and that Benson then said, Mr.

14:58.844 --> 15:11.942
President, you asked for recommendations. If you 
didn't want to get them, you shouldn't have asked.

15:14.185 --> 15:15.427
This I remember, yes. And then later, Rutter 
called him and said, thank you, Fred, I needed

15:15.447 --> 15:20.814
that. Yes, that did happen. Now that I think of it, 
it did happen. When Mr. Rutter was getting ready to

15:25.220 --> 15:37.390
go to Austin or was getting ready to do something 
related to state politics, to whom did he turn for

15:25.220 --> 15:37.390
advice on those points?

15:41.386 --> 15:43.188
Do you mean like for a budget hearing? Budget 
hearing or any kind of politicking in Austin.

15:46.894 --> 15:52.822
Well, he would talk always with the people that 
represented us first. He would never go in there

15:54.244 --> 16:01.534
ignorant of what their position was and why it 
would have been like that. Then he would, well,

16:02.115 --> 16:09.705
what he would find out very quickly is who's for and 
who's against. whether it was our people or not but

16:10.040 --> 16:36.655
he'd call on our people to say okay what's holding 
us back on this who is it and then he'd work through

16:10.040 --> 16:36.655
he

16:10.040 --> 16:36.655
would work through his political system to see if 
they couldn't come around and he wouldn't

16:10.040 --> 16:36.655
necessarily want his name used but some cases he 
would but he had so many political connections in

16:10.040 --> 16:36.655
big places that He would find out where the 
opposition was and try to hit it with long-range

16:38.103 --> 16:48.838
artillery, thinking of alternatives if this 
didn't happen. I don't mean he was crooked about

16:49.419 --> 16:50.881
it. He just played his politics. Now, we didn't 
have, A&M didn't have a hired lobbyist then, did

16:52.904 --> 16:59.153
we? Not that I recall. No, and we didn't have a 
full-time staff member. No. That, in effect, he

17:04.961 --> 17:06.263
was. He was it. Mm-hmm. And I don't think he would 
have trusted anybody else to do it. He was smart

17:12.631 --> 17:13.652
enough. He didn't come in on the pickle truck, and 
he knew that his name was Magic. And why pay some guy

17:19.997 --> 17:31.487
even $10,000 or $12,000 a year, throwing money 
away, to do a job that he can do better with just a few

17:19.997 --> 17:31.487
phone calls? And he may have been right. And also in 
those olden days, the number of key people were

17:39.005 --> 18:08.151
clearly more clearly identifiable then than they 
are now yeah a lot of them had long tours of duty and

17:39.005 --> 18:08.151
built up to positions you know like uh bill hobby 
and uh others like that and uh he knew them i mean he

17:39.005 --> 18:08.151
knew them uh whatever sources he had he knew how 
things were going to go and where the key uh where

18:09.582 --> 18:11.624
the key massaging had to be done. And that's where 
he'd call Boyle and Sam Wittenberg and say, look,

18:12.185 --> 18:20.195
you got an old boy out here that's really giving us 
hell. They're always having trouble out around

18:20.215 --> 18:24.901
Lubbock, obviously, for obvious reasons. And I 
think that's where Sam Wittenberg, if Sam

18:26.142 --> 18:38.357
Wittenberg was against someone that was a 
candidate for senator or what have you, they ain't

18:26.142 --> 18:38.357
going to make it. The maddest I heard him, now on 
that subject, little bits and pieces come back as I

18:40.767 --> 18:48.805
talk. He called me about 11 o'clock one night. He 
said, Eddie, I'm going to call three names and you

18:53.396 --> 18:57.325
tell me which ones you've heard of. And he called 
those three names, and I said, sir, I don't know

18:59.650 --> 19:06.822
anybody that you're talking about. He says, well, 
that's what that goddamn Preston Smith has put on

19:06.842 --> 19:11.871
our board of directors. He said he asked me for a 
short list of who to consider, and I gave it to him,

19:12.372 --> 19:20.325
and I called him when I found out what he was doing. 
Peyton McKnight was one of them. Boy, I wasn't a

19:23.811 --> 19:24.752
hill winner. And he said, I called the governor. I 
said, I don't know who these people are. He said,

19:35.289 --> 19:36.812
how can this be? You asked me for my list, and I gave 
it to you. He says, well, there's only one

19:39.897 --> 19:42.621
difference, Earl. He says, they were on my list, 
but they weren't on yours.

19:48.368 --> 19:52.554
And that was, I'm nearly sure that was Preston 
Smith. I think that's right. I've heard many

19:53.415 --> 20:00.546
people offer great praise for John Connolly's 
appointment quality. Did Mr. Rutter sometimes

20:02.729 --> 20:08.657
have an input to the governor, to Governor 
Connolly?

20:11.602 --> 20:11.782
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And when he wanted somebody from 
the high plains, why not pick the man that

20:18.085 --> 20:26.778
influences everybody in the High Plains every 
time they drink coffee? Because he owns all the

20:28.520 --> 20:30.003
newspapers.

20:32.807 --> 20:43.182
And Sam, I don't think Sam came to a third of the 
meetings, but you could call him up and say, Sam,

20:32.807 --> 20:43.182
we're still having a problem with old Senator 
Snart up there. And boy, that would be over. It was

20:45.328 --> 20:45.809
over. When we were almost all of the board of 
directors, as they were then called, almost all of

20:48.192 --> 20:55.783
their meetings were here. That's correct. How did 
he prepare for those meetings?

21:03.093 --> 21:12.747
An

21:03.093 --> 21:12.747
exchange of agenda items, first of all, on paper, 
as I recall. Now, very often I wouldn't see that.

21:16.299 --> 21:20.184
That was not part of my, he wouldn't get me involved 
in those things.

21:23.909 --> 21:32.942
And he would say, you know, to Mr. Wells or whoever, 
Clyde, man, you're talking about a hot item there.

21:33.002 --> 21:37.649
He said, this is not the time to have that one on that 
agenda. And in those days, they would strike it. So

21:42.511 --> 21:48.893
he would pretty well, he had a lot of influence 
about what the agenda would be. then they would

21:50.155 --> 22:18.171
have a closed session and have their arguments and 
then they would usually have an open session or a

21:50.155 --> 22:18.171
press conference if anybody was interested and uh 
announced unanimous approval always unanimous

21:50.155 --> 22:18.171
approval of whatever came out so telephone and 
written exchange of agenda items and i'm sure well

21:50.155 --> 22:18.171
how do you how are you going to vote on this thing And 
it was pretty well worked out. And by the time they

22:21.455 --> 22:29.947
got here, they could have sat around and had 
cocktails because it was all pretty well done. But

22:30.507 --> 22:37.236
their opinion really was, what can we do to support 
you now at this meeting? Now, when you first went to

22:37.256 --> 22:43.144
work for him, Dr. Harrington was the chancellor of 
the system. But during your years... the system

22:48.155 --> 22:52.800
Mr. Rutter would become the chief officer of both. 
Yeah, I was his assistant at that time. Oh, that

22:55.482 --> 22:57.404
would be after you left? Yes. Were there some pulls 
and tugs between the campus president and the

22:59.727 --> 23:08.436
system chancellor when you were working for Mr. 
Rutter?

23:13.541 --> 23:14.702
I think the biggest

23:19.930 --> 23:25.463
The most controversial thing that I can remember 
was who the service directors reported to. And of

23:26.024 --> 23:32.139
course that came out with later presidencies too 
as an issue of some import. But he wanted control.

23:36.400 --> 23:51.235
And part of it was that he knew that the services 
generally had a lot of public support, and he just

23:36.400 --> 23:51.235
wanted the university to be affiliated with all 
those good things that were happening out there.

23:52.656 --> 23:56.440
And again, it's part of military. It ought to be 
under the commanding general, and that's what his

23:58.522 --> 24:01.345
job was. And let the chancellor worry about the 
budget and go into Austin and get the money for us

24:02.455 --> 24:09.627
with our help of course. But those services should 
be under the college. I know that athletics is now a

24:16.479 --> 24:22.749
big time consumer of any campus executive. What 
about athletics in that era?

24:31.649 --> 24:47.170
He

24:31.649 --> 24:47.170
looked at football as a potential plus factor for 
the reputation of the school and as just

24:31.649 --> 24:47.170
compensation for the undying generosity of its 
alumni. And I think, personally, I think he

24:48.572 --> 24:54.940
overplayed the hand a little bit Like before the 
Cotton Bowl game, he called Stallings, he said

24:55.848 --> 25:03.220
Stallings like no other one. Like Jack Williams 
could say Pereira Review better. But he got the

25:08.348 --> 25:13.837
team assembled after practice one day and got 
right out in the middle of them in the practice

25:08.348 --> 25:13.837
field. His favorite photograph that's ever been 
made was him talking, giving a pep talk to the team

25:20.300 --> 25:28.030
before they went to the 1968 Cotton Bowl game where 
they did beat Alabama. And he took me with him from

25:28.871 --> 25:41.407
that game into the dressing room to thank the boys 
for paying so much attention to what he had said to

25:28.871 --> 25:41.407
them before the game. But see, he had been a coach 
and it just was part of his bloodstream.

25:49.763 --> 25:52.727
He wanted excellence in football. And the other 
sports, he wouldn't have walked across the street

25:52.747 --> 25:55.970
for. And didn't, as far as I can remember. He went to 
the football games, particularly the home games,

25:59.134 --> 26:02.178
regularly. But I wasn't aware that he attended 
many of the other sports. Yeah, he did. Oh, other

26:07.885 --> 26:09.046
sports? Did not. That's one. And he went to nearly 
all of the out-of-town games. One time he called me

26:17.270 --> 26:29.427
like on a Friday,

26:17.270 --> 26:29.427
and we were playing Texas Tech in Lubbock, and the 
odds were very good that we weren't going to win

26:17.270 --> 26:29.427
that game. It had not been a good season. And he 
said, how'd you like to go dove hunting? I said,

26:36.196 --> 26:37.377
well, sure, when? He said, we'll go out to ranch and 
shoot some doves tomorrow. I said, well, sir,

26:42.885 --> 26:45.268
we're playing Tech tomorrow, how's that going to 
work? He said, I'll tell you how it's worked. I'm

26:49.296 --> 26:53.503
sick and tired of this, getting our butts whipped, 
and I'm not going to love it. He said, let's go dove

26:54.544 --> 26:55.686
hunting. I'm not going to tell anybody where we 
are. So Ms. Rutter and Peggy and I and Mr. Rutter

26:57.990 --> 27:04.019
went out there, and we shot some ducks illegally. I 
did. They were on the pond where we were shooting

27:05.642 --> 27:08.887
doves. The doves weren't coming in, and I said to 
him, Have you ever had fried duck? He says, no, I bet

27:14.021 --> 27:15.663
that'd be good. And I said, well, just keep your 
head down. I'm going to shoot a couple. And I did,

27:19.109 --> 27:20.872
and we had fried duck. And he just thought that was 
great. But we had a grand time. We went to London.

27:30.408 --> 27:32.812
He said, have you ever seen the dance hall at 
London? I said, no. He said, we're going down there

27:37.645 --> 27:40.308
and eat a chicken fried steak. And the girls stayed 
at the house. And he and I drove to London, Texas,

27:43.593 --> 27:50.061
which is about eight miles from London, eight 
miles to Hex, to the ranch. It was in between. And

27:53.425 --> 27:55.708
there was a dance hall right next door. And while 
the tech kickoff was underway, he and I were at the

27:55.768 --> 28:04.119
London Cafe eating chicken fried steak. And the 
band was struck up next door. at the dance hall, and

28:08.122 --> 28:12.288
they are still there, that little dance hall. And I 
said, well, you reckon the dance is in full bloom

28:13.309 --> 28:18.576
yet? And he held his hand up against the wooden 
wall, and he says, no, it ain't vibrating enough

28:18.596 --> 28:22.962
yet. He said, they're not really. But he'd had a 
stomach full of it, and he didn't want to face West

28:25.125 --> 28:31.193
Texas. And we did that several times, just escape 
and go out. Alright, hunting or fishing, what

28:37.248 --> 28:44.641
other escapes were there for him from the 
pressures of the task? What did he do to relax? He'd

28:47.566 --> 28:50.191
go out to the ranch and look at the cows.

28:53.437 --> 29:00.910
He was not gifted in any way with hunting or 
fishing. He was very poorly coordinated. Oh, so he

29:03.814 --> 29:05.916
didn't hunt or fish much? Oh, he'd go. Oh, okay. But 
you're saying he wasn't that skillful. He wasn't

29:08.880 --> 29:09.601
good at it. We were down at Tennicott

29:10.022 --> 29:16.610
with an alumni board meeting. And there's 
probably the best fishing lakes in Texas. And Bob

29:20.735 --> 29:22.898
Logan and I are both fishermen. And we'd go out and 
we'd catch enough fish the first morning to feed

29:23.266 --> 29:29.315
the whole group a big fish dinner. And that 
afternoon, after we brought in huge stringers of

29:30.496 --> 29:40.491
fish, it was just get the hook out and know how to 
bring them in. And he said, Edwin, I want you to take

29:40.571 --> 29:44.196
me fishing this afternoon. I took him out there. 
He'd cast right into the wind and the line would

29:45.879 --> 29:50.185
loop out like this. And the fish would grab it and 
start off with it. By the time he set the hook with

29:52.699 --> 29:57.164
the wind loop in it, the fish was gone. He was just 
poorly coordinated. Same with shooting the gun.

30:00.527 --> 30:01.828
He was not good at it. But he would go out. We'd go to 
Herman Heap Place at Buda and hunt quail. Well,

30:11.138 --> 30:12.179
that was a joke. Or we'd fish. And he'd sit around 
and talk with whoever our host was. Then we go into

30:18.717 --> 30:22.213
Austin and go to the Hofbrau and have a big steak. 
What he liked to do was have a few beers and eat a big

30:22.666 --> 30:26.170
steak. That's how he relaxed. Because he had no 
hobbies, did he? Had no hobbies, none whatever. He

30:33.058 --> 30:33.738
didn't. The only collection he had was medals that 
he had earned. And that was a pretty good

30:40.046 --> 30:41.247
collection. All right, let's end this pleasant 
interview with at least one funny rudder story.

30:49.516 --> 30:50.277
The best one. And I know I've told you before, but it 
ought to be recorded. I'm in his office with a happy

30:54.201 --> 30:58.044
file and a sad file one morning. We're playing 
Baylor University on Saturday. This is like

31:02.268 --> 31:03.470
Thursday. Abner McCall calls him. I'm in the 
office. He says, keep your seat. It's Abner. Ms.

31:10.196 --> 31:11.657
Hott had called and told us. And they talk 
business.
