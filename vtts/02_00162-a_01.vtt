WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:15.728
June 17 or 18 on the way to Godley to do an interview 
checking to see if the machine is working.

14:37.447 --> 14:37.807
OK. This is Thursday, June 18. And we're out in 
beautiful overlook with a little bit of promise of

14:43.375 --> 14:53.348
shower,

14:43.375 --> 14:53.348
chatting with Fred Palmer, class of 59. I

14:53.589 --> 15:02.000
think I mentioned to you in advance, first 
question, why did you go to Texas A&M? Why did you go

15:02.921 --> 15:03.902
to college? How did you go? So forth. Well, I was 
like most or many in my generation. I was the first

15:10.872 --> 15:18.105
person in the family, the extended family, that 
went to college. And so I was very blessed in that

15:18.666 --> 15:20.669
regard. My mother was the advocate for that. My 
daddy was not anti-college. He thought it was a

15:27.041 --> 15:30.387
good idea, but he was not the advocate of it. like my 
mama was. And I remember when I was just a little

15:33.005 --> 15:39.011
kid, I was watching when television was very 
early, and most of it was snow and a rolling screen.

15:39.032 --> 15:45.559
I was looking at a travel program, something like 
the Galapagos Islands or somewhere like that. And

15:46.520 --> 15:53.467
I was raised in a thousand-acre state park, so the 
out-of-the-way places and that sort of thing

15:46.520 --> 15:53.467
appealed to me. I said, I'd love to do that someday. 
She said, if you get you a good education, there's

15:55.389 --> 15:58.973
no reason you can't do things like that. That's one 
of the earliest comments I ever remember about my

15:59.678 --> 16:05.104
aspiration to go to college. I had an uncle that 
went to Texas, an uncle that lived with us much of

16:06.465 --> 16:10.910
the time, so he was more like a brother. He was, you 
know, 20 years older, but he was like a brother. I

16:15.555 --> 16:16.256
adored him. He went to Texas, and you'd think that 
he would have had more influence on my decision to

16:17.958 --> 16:24.325
go to college. But when I was a boy, probably 12 or 
something, There were some fisheries biologists

16:29.918 --> 16:34.428
that came to Tyler State Park to do some fish 
management. My daddy became fast friends with a

16:34.468 --> 16:37.535
biologist named Cecil Reed. And Cecil was one of 
the earlier graduates of A&M with a master's

16:38.376 --> 16:43.067
degree. And Cecil Reed had with him an assistant, a 
young man working for the summer. And his name was

16:50.152 --> 16:55.324
Norfleet Bone, Jr. And his daddy was with the Texas 
Parks Board. And those guys were Aggies. Between

16:57.148 --> 16:59.894
Mr. Reed and Mr. Bone, they talked about A&M. And 
from that point on, I never remember really giving

17:04.083 --> 17:08.413
a lot of ball to go anyplace else with A&M. And I 
thought about it mainly because, maybe because I

17:09.338 --> 17:15.543
had an interest in doing wildlife work or 
fisheries or something like that. Again, raising

17:15.563 --> 17:18.466
a thousand acre state park out like that. I'd fish 
before I'd go to school in the morning, things like

17:18.566 --> 17:22.169
that sometimes. So my interest was very early in 
A&M. And it might have been directed more toward

17:24.491 --> 17:30.716
the studies, but I think I remember clearly the 
fervor that those guys had. And they talked about

17:30.736 --> 17:34.079
A&M all the time or A&M caps and that sort of thing. 
For some reason, that influence was indelible on

17:34.099 --> 17:38.923
me, relative even to my hunger. He was a student. I 
visited with him. I went down and spent a few days

17:41.517 --> 17:45.402
with him one time in his apartment there in Texas. 
But for some reason, that never had a good, as they

17:45.942 --> 17:50.387
said, he didn't get a good scald on me. But those 
Aggies had a real interesting impact on my life. So

17:54.752 --> 17:59.337
when I got to high school, my interest was in 
studying wildlife work of some kind. And it just

18:00.078 --> 18:02.160
followed that I would do that. Now, I was prepared 
to go to A&M while my friends were going to Air Force

18:02.663 --> 18:07.391
ROTC and everything. My family had some real 
severe financial reversals when I was about a

18:08.072 --> 18:14.583
junior in high school. And it had to do with the 
lawsuit involving integration, a class action

18:15.365 --> 18:20.233
lawsuit. by the NAACP against the Texas State 
Parks Board because blacks could not come into the

18:20.956 --> 18:26.746
state parks. They sued them. They closed Tyler 
State Park. My dad was a caretaker there. Instead

18:31.395 --> 18:33.058
of a manager, he became a caretaker. And the pay was 
dismal. We all had jobs doing something. He pumped

18:36.905 --> 18:40.491
oil wells and, you know, hauled rocks and did 
whatever he had to do. When I got ready to go to A&M,

18:41.072 --> 18:42.775
we sat down. He said, I don't think you can go. So I 
went to Tyler Junior College for two years, trying

18:44.902 --> 18:49.828
to transfer all the while. In those days, when 
Daddy said, I don't think you can go, you didn't

18:49.848 --> 18:54.394
say, Dad, I think you're wrong. I think I will. That 
wasn't done. It was just not discussed anymore. He

18:58.800 --> 19:00.562
was a decision maker, and that's what was done. As 
soon as I could, I transferred to A&M. So you came as

19:02.925 --> 19:05.628
a junior. Well, I came in the junior year. That's 
what I mean. I was short on hours to transfer. Yeah.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.995
I spent three years at A&M. All right. Now one of the 
things I've been asking everybody is describe

19:12.526 --> 19:19.798
when you came to enroll for the first time. How did 
you get there and what did you bring with you

19:20.339 --> 19:23.644
physically? What gear, what equipment? That's a 
great question because you don't think about that

19:27.490 --> 19:30.174
very much. I went to A&M.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.681
My dad had a state pickup, and they stayed right 
there in the state parks. They had transportation

19:39.721 --> 19:42.965
up to the store at the entrance of the park and so on. 
So I was able to borrow the family car, and my best

19:43.005 --> 19:47.711
friend from home was going to A&M, too. We had dates 
the evening before, took them home, went back out

19:48.352 --> 20:04.150
of our place in the Sandflat community off of 
Tyler, got our gear, which consisted basically

19:48.352 --> 20:04.150
probably just the basic stuff, a few things on 
hangers and duffel bags or something like that, or

19:48.352 --> 20:04.150
suitcases, and we took off. We got to A&M before 
dawn. We drove that night and got there before

20:07.341 --> 20:09.348
dawn. We parked over by the old MSC, and I remember 
sitting out there when the sun started coming up,

20:10.091 --> 20:16.333
the water sprinklers came up. And we sat there as 
the sun came up. The sprinters came on water in

20:18.653 --> 20:21.940
Simpson Drill Field. And it came down to register, 
and we did not know straight up. Only thing, that's

20:27.110 --> 20:30.797
the first time I'd ever seen Texas A&M. And I had a 
map, I guess, because in those days when you

20:31.719 --> 20:37.630
started trying to get in, the first thing I 
remember was, But you started getting a

20:37.880 --> 20:43.306
tremendous amount of literature from Lupo's and 
places like that, the college bookstore.

20:43.326 --> 20:44.066
Exciting time. I remember that so well. And this 
fall of 56? This would be the fall of 57. 57, OK. And

20:48.351 --> 20:52.355
so anyway. All right, then you register. Where did 
you? Went to Sevesa. Found their way. Didn't even

20:58.501 --> 20:59.702
know where it was. Had a map, I guess, as I recall. We 
probably did. Made it to Sevesa. One of the most

21:04.981 --> 21:09.225
frustrating days of my entire life was 
registration. I didn't know anything about it.

21:11.607 --> 21:13.229
Been to junior college, which is easy. Went to 
Sabisa Hall, and they had this huge, you know,

21:13.910 --> 21:21.417
congregation of tables all over the place with 
signs about what it was. And I'm sitting there

21:21.437 --> 21:23.139
trying to work out a schedule. No counseling at 
all. Go over in the section before, and none were

21:25.921 --> 21:28.684
open. Then I go back, and it took me probably close 
to half a day to register. And I was so frustrated, I

21:33.280 --> 21:35.563
didn't know which end was up. And what I ended up 
taking, and whoever knows how that worked out. But

21:40.390 --> 21:44.857
that was really a very frustrating thing, because 
I didn't know where to go, didn't know what I was

21:40.390 --> 21:44.857
doing. And it was a trial and error thing, but I put 
some kind of a schedule together. Describe the

21:49.905 --> 21:50.906
campus. What did it look like, and what was there? 
Well, in my mind, it's the campus as everybody

21:55.353 --> 21:58.377
remembers it. I'm sure, but that's of course not 
the case. The water tower was there, the

22:00.914 --> 22:03.158
smokestacks were there. It was back when the old 
laundry was down there by the, you know, down there

22:03.178 --> 22:08.206
by the north gate. And the gyne hall was there. MSC 
was small. It had been built I think in 50 or

22:12.253 --> 22:14.617
something like that. And a friendly place, I 
remember that. And of course all male. Most of the

22:21.391 --> 22:27.439
guys were in uniform and I felt like a left shoe on 
the right foot all the way. I knew what I had missed.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.364
I still know what I had missed. That is one of the 
great regrets of my life. I can't change it. I can't

22:35.669 --> 22:42.077
fret over it, but I'm a great advocate of A&M's 
Corps of Cadets because they were there and they

22:35.669 --> 22:42.077
did it. I wasn't there, but I observed it up close 
and I knew what I was missing at the time. So that

22:46.990 --> 22:49.413
campus is mostly core. The core guys have marched 
the chapel. And I believe they marched the chapel

22:51.075 --> 22:56.341
in the morning, in the evening, and I don't know 
about the lunch. I don't know that they would have

22:56.381 --> 22:57.903
been launched. I think that's correct. And where 
did you live? I lived over in dorm 16, which is over

23:00.546 --> 23:04.270
the campus there. And I can't remember, is it Gary 
Hall or something, Davis Gary or something? I

23:08.235 --> 23:08.635
believe so. That area over there, dorm 16, it runs 
parallel to 60 out there. And we used to sit up there

23:15.340 --> 23:21.867
in that room and watch the cadets go out and all the 
Aggies do a midnight show over at the campus there.

23:21.887 --> 23:30.596
But I lived in 16, and I think it was the rest of my 
time, that's the first year, the rest of my time I

23:21.887 --> 23:30.596
was over in Walton Hall, which is the old athletic 
dorm. Athletes moved out and students went in

23:31.076 --> 23:35.621
there. Describe a typical, the routine of a 
typical day classes, day of classes. What time did

23:42.328 --> 23:44.250
you get up, what did you do, where, when? Well, I 
don't know what the cause is, but in those days, it

23:44.433 --> 23:50.607
would be very, very, well, I don't know anybody 
took 13, 14 hours. Everybody took 17, 18, 19 hours.

23:56.903 --> 24:02.272
I was in wildlife work, a wildlife major, and so lab 
was just typical. Those are lab courses. To take an

24:04.035 --> 24:18.338
English course or something like that was almost a 
break because I'm not saying I excelled in those,

24:04.035 --> 24:18.338
but the point is it was a relief because I took so 
many lab courses that typically school was all day

24:04.035 --> 24:18.338
long, or many of the days it was. And so that was, we 
got up in the morning and my men in the Corps, I tried

24:18.807 --> 24:24.815
to go to breakfast. Mama taught me to try to go to 
breakfast. In Sevesa? In Sevesa. And they had the

24:29.182 --> 24:37.674
Corps at one end of Sevesa and the non-regs up on the 
other end, not the other end, on the east end of

24:29.182 --> 24:37.674
Sevesa I believe it was. And of course we were 
intermingling to a certain extent, but we were

24:38.395 --> 24:42.841
segregated for the most part. And the waiters of 
course waited tables, family style. and went to

24:48.575 --> 24:52.399
breakfast, and I think meals must have cost us 
right under 50 cents a piece. We bought a meal

24:52.419 --> 24:53.260
ticket. It wasn't a deal where you bought kind of a 
meal ticket and ate over at Northgate because you

24:53.280 --> 24:57.365
couldn't afford it, number one. The second thing 
is we just, I'm not saying no one did it. I didn't

25:01.089 --> 25:02.851
know anybody that did that. So we had meal tickets 
for the semester, had laundry. I think the meals

25:06.134 --> 25:09.878
were about, they averaged a little less than 50 
cents a piece. Good food, frankly. We all brag, but

25:11.080 --> 25:14.143
that's what you're supposed to do. I think laundry 
was something like $13 a semester and running for

25:14.731 --> 25:19.678
something like $12 a semester. I went to class, 
went to lunch at Sabisa. Usually have classes at 1

25:27.089 --> 25:28.470
o'clock. I don't remember what it's like not to 
have classes at 1 o'clock. And by golly, I was in

25:32.176 --> 25:34.679
class for the most part. Unfortunately, when I 
didn't have class, instead of going to my room and

25:34.779 --> 25:43.692
studying for the most part, we had intramurals and 
being a wildlife guy, especially in my last year,

25:44.144 --> 25:47.969
Sometimes we'd go out to the river and go fishing or 
take in those wildlife courses. I'd go up to

25:47.989 --> 25:52.495
Binoculars out over 30 and 60 intersects south of 
Campbell's out there. Those are cotton fields

25:52.815 --> 25:56.600
now, but that was a freshwater marsh out there in 
those days. We'd go up there to Binoculars from the

25:56.981 --> 26:01.647
Wildlife Department and watch waterfowl and 
stuff like that. Did some, had some wildlife

26:01.667 --> 26:06.413
projects out around by the airport, little lakes 
out around the airport. And that's what I did on my

26:06.433 --> 26:07.875
days. In the evenings we'd go to chow. And I'm sorry 
to say that we had usually a pretty big bull session

26:09.743 --> 26:14.710
in our room right after chat. Instead of studying, 
everybody came to the room and shot the bull. All

26:18.716 --> 26:21.881
right, then let's do a Saturday afternoon and 
evening. What did you and your friends do? Well, it

26:24.224 --> 26:30.634
may lead into something we need to talk about later 
on, but my first semester, I was dating a girl who

26:24.224 --> 26:30.634
was head majorette at Tyler High School. And I 
thought, of course, she was the prettiest thing I

26:31.415 --> 26:33.338
ever met. And wouldn't you know it, I met her this 
summer for good. And we dated all the time. I lived

26:38.236 --> 26:44.845
out at the state park 10 miles out, and the girls 
would come out there, and we spent a lot of time

26:38.236 --> 26:44.845
together and had a great relationship. When I went 
off to A&M, she continued to date, and I was going to

26:44.865 --> 26:55.941
also, but the only difference was there were no 
girls at A&M. So we had Saturday classes. I'd get

26:58.645 --> 27:00.287
our class at noon on Saturday. And I typically had 
that little maroon Aggie bag, and I'd throw some

27:00.588 --> 27:08.279
underwear and socks and a shirt or something in 
there and take off and hitchhike to Thailand. I did

27:08.299 --> 27:11.824
that almost every weekend, except football 
weekends. And I remember having a date, and maybe

27:11.844 --> 27:15.649
she came that one weekend or something for 
football. I don't think my mom or daddy brought her

27:15.669 --> 27:18.533
down there. And we were home at football. You know, 
and then we'd go after football. We'd hang around,

27:23.380 --> 27:25.102
shoot the breeze. There wasn't really much to do. 
We felt very, very affluent. We would go to the

27:31.047 --> 27:41.239
Mexican restaurant, Mexican food restaurant, 
over where Hilton is now, back this side, back the

27:31.047 --> 27:41.239
college side of Hilton. Mexican restaurant out 
there, back in the trees, no paved roads or

27:41.259 --> 27:44.503
anything. We'd go out there. Or go down to the 
Triangle, which is where Tom's Barbecue, I think,

27:46.045 --> 27:52.252
is, right in through there. Or go down to the Texan. 
The Texan wasn't a high dollar place. Now, those

27:54.735 --> 27:57.458
had car hops in those days. And we'd go down there. 
Occasionally we'd go down to Humdinger, which is a

27:59.482 --> 28:12.894
little, looks like a little sheet metal building 
down in that area somewhere, before you got to that

27:59.482 --> 28:12.894
area, right before you got to the Triangle or 
something, maybe just past it. And we'd drink

28:12.914 --> 28:16.397
beer, and I think at night it cost 20 cents a bottle 
or something like that. And we didn't drink a lot of

28:16.417 --> 28:17.518
beer. We'd go down and have a beer or two, you know, 
something. Couldn't afford it to begin with. I was

28:20.761 --> 28:23.684
on borrowed money, but basically the whole time. 
Youngbloods was there. Occasionally go to

28:25.125 --> 28:26.907
Youngbloods. Martin's, the barbecue place over 
there, was there. And Steve, Bohemian fella, had

28:32.316 --> 28:35.761
that thing. It would go down there and make a beer or 
something. But that's kind of exaggerating our

28:38.304 --> 28:40.486
life. We did that. That's what we did when we did 
anything. Go to Guy and to the movies, you know. And

28:45.713 --> 28:50.098
I think in the spring, the Grove was open. I think it 
was. I've been to the Grove to movies before, but

28:50.799 --> 28:56.526
also went on summer tour. Did Did anybody ever go to 
Whiskey Bridge? Whiskey Bridge. I never did go to

29:01.668 --> 29:04.172
Whiskey Bridge because I didn't drink whiskey. 
But occasionally guys would start playing cards

29:04.713 --> 29:09.500
on Saturday afternoon late and end up somewhere at 
Whiskey Bridge. I was well aware of it, and I knew

29:09.520 --> 29:14.848
where it was, but I didn't personally go to Whiskey 
Bridge. Correct me if I'm wrong. Whiskey was legal

29:15.996 --> 29:19.522
to purchase in Burleson County. That's right, 
right across the province. Did, normally, did

29:21.505 --> 29:27.094
they drink it over there or bring it back this side 
of the river? Oh, I doubt they drank it over there. I

29:28.596 --> 29:29.658
think they brought it back. In the rooms, there 
weren't room searches or anything. I mean, that

29:32.903 --> 29:35.948
really, in retrospect, it was a pretty clean-cut 
bunch of kids. They did some drinking, but it was

29:36.408 --> 29:42.658
not a, and loud, but in other water fights, and 
jacking around with somebody in the dorm. It was

29:45.632 --> 29:53.042
just mischievous stuff, but there was a pretty 
doggone clean-cut bunch of guys. Let's see. Let's

29:54.644 --> 30:00.232
talk about dorm or campus good bull pranks, jokes. 
Describe as many of those as you can think of. Well,

30:04.818 --> 30:09.945
of course, the most common thing that was 
widespread was water fights. And to use the

30:10.313 --> 30:14.298
vernacular those days, the crapper heads were on 
those commodes. And, you know, you go through the

30:15.640 --> 30:24.713
showers, and if you flushed the commodes at one 
time or the urinals at one time, they used the cold

30:15.640 --> 30:24.713
water so it got real hot in the showers. You're 
supposed to holler crapper when you flush. That

30:27.797 --> 30:31.983
way the guy can step out of the shower and let the 
time of the cold water come back and not scald him

30:27.797 --> 30:31.983
when he's in there. There was always a guy or two 
around that was kind of a nerd or a jerk or

30:33.164 --> 30:37.570
something, you know, like that. So it was always 
kind of fun to run down there. when they were in the

30:39.980 --> 30:40.802
shower. Sneak in there and flush all of those at one 
time. Get to hot water, hot all of a sudden on these

30:44.734 --> 30:47.381
guys. And of course they'd run out and you'd leave. 
That was kind of good for them. Water fights were a

30:51.640 --> 30:53.002
big thing. Dorm, between dorms, and they'd get 
wastebasket, turn the showers on. The showers

30:56.285 --> 31:00.650
were, there were showers that had shower heads on 
each side of the little room. You'd walk through

31:01.111 --> 31:05.736
there down one side, back out the other, and 
probably most of us didn't have on a stitch. Maybe

31:05.756 --> 31:12.504
bathing suits, maybe our clothes, and go through 
there, fill those wastebasket baskets up, run out

31:05.756 --> 31:12.504
of the dorm, have huge water fights out there. It 
normally would start with somebody studying

31:13.105 --> 31:20.533
their room in the springtime, and somebody having 
a wastebasket full of water, and going to throw

31:13.105 --> 31:20.533
water from the school.
