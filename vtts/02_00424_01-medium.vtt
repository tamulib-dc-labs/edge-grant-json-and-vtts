Test 1, 2, 3. This

00:08.269 --> 00:27.516
is an interview with Colonel Barbé by Christian 
Williams on 29 April 1993 at the Trigon concerning

00:08.269 --> 00:27.516
Colonel Barbé's experiences in Vietnam. In the 
interest of accumulating knowledge, I am asking

00:27.536 --> 00:35.286
you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral 
History Collection in the University Archives.

00:35.890 --> 00:37.532
Is that all right with you, sir? Sure

00:37.552 --> 00:48.468
is. Please state your name, sir. Yeah, my name's 
William Leland Barbay. You're in current

00:53.095 --> 00:55.619
position to hold the university, sir? I'm the 
professor of naval science and the CO of the NROTC

00:55.639 --> 01:00.146
unit. Your date of birth, sir, and place of birth? I 
was born in Kinston, North Carolina on 4 April,

01:03.650 --> 01:06.953
1942. Sir, if you could briefly tell me a little bit 
about your parents, their careers, and your

01:07.093 --> 01:15.260
family life. Well, I'm a Marine junior. My dad was a 
career Marine, was in the Marine Corps for 27 years

01:16.661 --> 01:23.727
and fought in both the World War II and the Korean 
conflict.

01:27.450 --> 01:33.015
I can follow it up to say I kind of lived all over the 
United States and overseas as a child. I mean, as my

01:33.400 --> 01:36.785
dad traveled quite a bit, being in the military. So 
what motivated you to become a Marine officer?

01:40.490 --> 01:44.697
Well, I've always been a very patriotic person. I 
kind of grew up in the Marine Corps. I was used to

01:47.040 --> 01:49.123
kind of the Marine Corps way of life. I love to 
travel. I love adventure. I love a challenge. So

01:53.530 --> 01:57.596
that was kind of my motivation toward a career in 
the military. Where did you attend college, sir? I

02:01.919 --> 02:04.462
went to the United States Merchant Marine Academy 
at Kings Point. It's one of the five federal

02:04.482 --> 02:09.968
academies, probably the least well-known, but 
nonetheless a federal academy. What was your

02:11.610 --> 02:14.173
reason for choosing this particular school, sir? 
Well, I had an appointment to the Naval Academy. I

02:17.116 --> 02:25.405
got an appointment to the Merchant Marine Academy 
from Senator Robinson of Virginia, and my best

02:17.116 --> 02:25.405
buddy also got an appointment, and he really 
talked me into going there. It's a small school

02:26.226 --> 02:30.070
with a regiment of about 1,000 cadets, and It 
sounded interesting to me, so I went. Sir, when did

02:35.912 --> 02:42.079
you report for OCS or begin your Marine career? 
Well, when I graduated from college, I was

02:42.099 --> 02:46.623
commissioned instant in the Navy, in active Naval 
Reserve. I sailed the merchant Marines for one

02:46.663 --> 02:48.425
year. I sailed with the MSCS. It was called MSTS 
then, Military Sealift Transportation Service,

02:52.149 --> 03:00.057
on the USS General Patch, which was a troop 
transport going between New York and Germany.

03:04.378 --> 03:06.241
About that time, the Vietnam War broke out. I had a 
twin brother who was a second lieutenant in the

03:06.261 --> 03:10.427
Marine Corps then, who was about to go to Vietnam. 
So I got real motivated to say, hey, I need to serve

03:10.447 --> 03:13.973
my country. So I resigned from the Air Reserve 
Commission and came to the Marine Corps through

03:15.395 --> 03:21.604
OCS in 1965, March of 1965. So in essence, you 
volunteered for duty in Vietnam by going ahead and

03:23.447 --> 03:29.436
joining the Marine Corps as an officer? Well, I 
joined the Marine Corps at that time. Vietnam War

03:33.916 --> 03:38.401
was just starting to get, the buildup was just 
starting over there. I was commissioned in June of

03:41.125 --> 03:45.470
1965 and went to flight school. I'm a naval 
aviator, so I went to flight school down in

03:46.591 --> 03:49.875
Pensacola, Florida. I was there. They had an 
accelerator program because of the Vietnam War,

03:50.796 --> 03:57.364
so I went through flight school in about ten 
months.

03:58.677 --> 04:05.806
I took part in flight school and joined my first 
squadron down at Marinko Air Station, New River,

03:58.677 --> 04:05.806
North Carolina. At that time, all my buddies were 
very anxious to get over to the war, you know, and

04:05.826 --> 04:11.553
get a taste of combat. So it wasn't a matter of 
volunteering. If you were the unit that was going

04:15.178 --> 04:18.042
to be assigned to go, you were going. When did you 
first arrive in Vietnam, sir, and who did you serve

04:19.624 --> 04:24.550
with, and in what role? I first arrived in Vietnam 
in, let's see, May of 1967. I joined the Marine

04:31.124 --> 04:42.955
Medium Helicopter Squadron 262, which was flying 
out of the Marine Air Facility Marlowe Mountain,

04:31.124 --> 04:42.955
which was on the coastline just east of Da Nang. I 
was a squadron pilot primarily. However, I did

04:47.500 --> 04:53.946
work in maintenance and did some work as a flight 
officer. mainly flew. What types of missions did

04:55.965 --> 04:59.491
you fly, sir? We flew assorted missions. The 
squadron that I joined was, had entered country as

05:02.376 --> 05:18.904
a brand new squadron about six months before I got 
there, so we had relatively brand new airplanes,

05:02.376 --> 05:18.904
and we flew almost

05:02.376 --> 05:18.904
just about 2,400 hours a month. Primarily recon 
insert extract. We did a lot of the troop assaults,

05:22.032 --> 05:25.235
helicopter-borne assaults. We did medevac, 
resupply, you name it. Basically, we did it. While

05:33.205 --> 05:39.012
you were serving in this role, sir, did you ever 
have any encounters with the ARVN forces? Were you

05:39.032 --> 05:40.233
ever working directly? We did a lot of missions 
with the ARVN where we did helicopter-borne

05:40.814 --> 05:48.283
assaults and hauled the ARVN forces into... into a 
strike area. I never during this part of my career

05:51.782 --> 05:59.632
had any direct relationship with the Yardmans. I 
had a twin brother who was a MACV SOG. I worked with

06:01.535 --> 06:04.859
him on a day-to-day basis. Based on your knowledge 
later in your career of the Yardmans, how would you

06:04.879 --> 06:10.827
assess them as a fighting force? Well, the South 
Vietnamese were were a developing force. You

06:21.606 --> 06:25.250
could compare them to the South Koreans at the time 
of the Korean War.

06:28.354 --> 06:29.455
They weren't trained very well. They weren't 
equipped very well. And it was a matter of working

06:30.876 --> 06:34.460
with them, giving them the equipment, giving them 
training. We did a lot of joint operations to try to

06:35.482 --> 06:42.770
develop their capabilities.

06:42.790 --> 06:48.156
But they were far inferior to the US forces and or 
the Korean forces that were over there. What did

06:50.178 --> 06:55.544
you feel about concerning their desire to fight, 
their desire to save their country, sir? Were they

06:55.824 --> 06:56.605
lacking? Were they lazy? I've read several 
accounts in the book of Bright and Shining Light

06:57.926 --> 07:12.722
where there have been several things said, and 
also in the book about the lack of desire on the part

06:57.926 --> 07:12.722
of the officers to do anything they wanted out of 
that was to become part of the political

06:57.926 --> 07:12.722
hierarchy. They really had no desire to take it to 
the end, sir. Well, I would say that there were some

07:17.802 --> 07:22.006
very good Arvin units. The Arvin Marines were very 
good. They were well trained and they fought very

07:24.228 --> 07:30.373
violently, but obviously there were some units 
over there also that weren't as good.

07:34.497 --> 07:37.200
Vietnam, the people were mainly peasants. You had 
the hierarchy over there that were schooled and

07:37.240 --> 07:46.628
had been more or less trained and developed by the 
French from Vietnam, who obviously were maybe

07:46.979 --> 08:10.590
uh using the war to meet their own political gains

07:46.979 --> 08:10.590
but i think the peasants as a whole were supportive 
of the war as far as the you know maintaining their

07:46.979 --> 08:10.590
freedoms and freedom and you might say a state of 
democracy however

08:12.865 --> 08:18.510
my impression that they were basic peasants, they 
were mainly farmers, and they just wanted to be

08:12.865 --> 08:18.510
left alone. And they were caught up into a 
humongous war, in which they could win. They could

08:24.036 --> 08:24.877
not win. And what I mean by that is, if the American 
forces occupied the territory and protected

08:24.897 --> 08:32.284
them, they were on the side of the American forces. 
But if we left the area, and the VVF-Con came in, or

08:32.324 --> 08:42.113
the NVA units came in, well, then they were loyal to 
the VVF-Con, where it was in power, where they were

08:32.324 --> 08:42.113
loyal to kind of You understand what I'm saying?

08:47.558 --> 08:47.758
Yes, sir. Prior to arriving in Vietnam, finding 
out you were assigned to Vietnam, what

08:47.818 --> 08:58.053
expectations or feelings or emotions did you have 
concerning that assignment, sir? Well, I think

08:58.073 --> 09:03.021
every young man wonders what combat's about. I 
know I'm from a Marine family, and I just developed

09:03.501 --> 09:09.450
buddies I went to high school with, The Marine 
Corps were officers in the Marine Corps, and we're

09:09.717 --> 09:13.401
going over to Vietnam to fight. I think knowing 
that it's kind of an unknown. You're kind of

09:19.747 --> 09:20.828
untested. You never know how someone's going to 
respond in combat.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.957
But I found when I got over there that it's doing a 
job. You do what you're trained to do, and you get

09:30.257 --> 09:33.521
served. At times you're scared. Sometimes 
adrenaline's pumping. But you have a mission, and

09:36.323 --> 09:39.066
you have a goal, and you try to achieve it.

09:42.792 --> 09:43.973
What else was the question there? Which feelings, 
expectations, or emotions

09:45.255 --> 09:54.946
did you have prior to going to the military? Yeah, I 
think that in the 67, 68 time frame,

09:55.106 --> 10:04.456
I think most of the young men that went over to 
Vietnam thought we were going over there for a good

09:55.106 --> 10:04.456
cause. The cause was to stop the communism in South 
Vietnam. We felt we were invited by the South

10:08.581 --> 10:12.445
Vietnamese government That our government 
committed the military forces and our government

10:13.133 --> 10:17.541
was behind us. To understand that the military is 
really a war is, let me put it this way,

10:18.262 --> 10:32.948
war is an instrument of policy. The military is an 
instrument of policy. So when the politicians and

10:36.756 --> 10:43.344
the nation agree to commit forces, then the 
military doesn't question why we go.

10:46.448 --> 10:52.215
How did these feelings or emotions change as your 
time in the country wore on, sir? From President

10:52.795 --> 10:58.742
Johnson to President Nixon, the Vietnamization 
plan, things like that, sir. How did those affect

10:58.862 --> 11:04.369
your feelings, or did your feelings change as far 
as the outcome of the war, sir? as far as why you

11:04.518 --> 11:08.464
personally were there, sir? Well, I was in Penford 
for almost two years, over two years. My first

11:13.553 --> 11:15.115
tour, I flew helicopters. I fought in the Battle of 
Quezon and the Battle of Waste City. I had the

11:22.127 --> 11:29.999
squadron I was in during the siege of Quezon lost 30 
aircraft and just about 10 air crews. I was shot

11:30.040 --> 11:30.981
myself.

11:33.577 --> 11:49.875
My second tour, I flew OB-10s as a light attack, 
visual reconnaissance, forward air control

11:33.577 --> 11:49.875
airborne, controlled over 550 flights of 
fixed-wing aircraft, close air support on enemy

11:33.577 --> 11:49.875
targets.

11:49.895 --> 11:56.783
During my two years there, the thing that amazed me 
was the American's military might, the power of

11:49.895 --> 11:56.783
the We have troops in contact within minutes. We 
could have artillery, naval gunfire, close air

11:59.650 --> 12:07.737
support overhead, supporting friendly forces.

12:07.757 --> 12:09.458
It was that way the entire time I was there. I never 
saw us lose a battle. Like I say, I was very busy.

12:14.582 --> 12:17.685
Flying over the Thames, I flew six hours a day, 
seven days a week. I didn't have a lot of time to be

12:17.705 --> 12:21.208
thinking about other things other than doing the 
mission. You get up on a six-hour mission where

12:22.249 --> 12:27.073
perhaps you have full Gs for... three hours, 
flying in an un-air-conditioned cockpit at 120

12:28.049 --> 12:45.937
degrees, firing your own ordnance, controlling 
other airplanes, talking to troops on the ground

12:28.049 --> 12:45.937
in a panic mode, you don't have a lot of time to be 
thinking about anything but the mission. So the

12:47.259 --> 12:52.327
thing, like I say, I was very proud of the American 
Fighting Forces over there, and I think we did a

12:47.259 --> 12:52.327
good job. However, it was discouraging from the 
point is that We had so many political ties put on

12:56.450 --> 13:02.796
us, restrictions, that the way we were going about 
it, we could never win the war. We won a lot of

13:03.496 --> 13:06.659
individual battles, but never won the war. All 
right, sir. I was just curious as to what kind of

13:08.260 --> 13:13.025
news you all received in country from the home 
front. Did the news of the protests on the

13:13.045 --> 13:20.291
campuses, things like that, get back to you and to 
other Marines, sir? And if it did, how did it affect

13:20.651 --> 13:24.735
the morale of the American fighting men in 
country? Well, in those days, it didn't quite have

13:24.985 --> 13:33.557
the

13:24.985 --> 13:33.557
perhaps the media blitz they have in modern 
warfare. But I think it probably impacted the

13:33.778 --> 13:39.345
people more in the military back here in the States 
than it did in any country. You know, the only

13:39.385 --> 13:50.301
newspaper we got was Stargent Strikes, which was a 
military paper that was really talked about

13:50.737 --> 13:53.682
troops and people that were actually fighting in 
combat. I think the biggest thing I can remember

13:53.722 --> 14:08.647
that probably really hurt American military men 
was in,

13:53.722 --> 14:08.647
I believe it was in 69, it may have been the 70s, I 
believe it was 69 when Jane Fonda went up to Hanoi.

14:11.091 --> 14:15.478
We in the military considered her a traitor to the 
nation. That hurt. But the thing is, when all these

14:17.483 --> 14:25.878
demonstrations were going on, and the peace 
movements, and the campus unrest, I missed most of

14:17.483 --> 14:25.878
that because I was in Vietnam. I read a little bit 
about it in the paper, but I wasn't here to actually

14:26.058 --> 14:29.624
see it. So I never really felt the impact of that 
until I got back and finally realized that I was

14:30.586 --> 14:38.780
kind of an outcast because I was a military man. And 
that was disappointing. Sir, what kind of

14:42.442 --> 14:49.333
treatment did you receive from the public when you 
came back to the United States following your

14:42.442 --> 14:49.333
retreat? Well, that was almost kind of like a 
non-treatment. Of course, a lot of people would

14:52.058 --> 14:58.769
cuss at you and call you warmongers.

14:58.809 --> 15:00.272
A lot of things were happening during that time. We 
were burning recruit centers and buildings and a

15:00.432 --> 15:08.365
lot of demonstrations outside military 
facilities. Because I came in the military, and

15:09.509 --> 15:12.694
the military is a very honorable profession. It's 
a lot like being a doctor, you know, saying

15:12.714 --> 15:17.881
equivalency, and it's a very honorable 
profession. And for the average military man, we

15:17.901 --> 15:20.926
didn't see that we were doing anything wrong. We 
were doing, again, the military is an instrument

15:21.286 --> 15:25.893
of policy. War is an instrument of policy. The 
politicians who were voted by the American people

15:27.556 --> 15:31.942
send the military in the action. The military, 
we're not political. We do what we're told to do to

15:33.384 --> 15:37.170
protect the Americans' interests. So for us, it 
was a big disappointment.

15:43.392 --> 15:52.725
Sir, obviously when you entered the conflict, you 
entered it feeling that the Americans would more

15:43.392 --> 15:52.725
than likely win the war and end the communist 
aggression. If at any point, when did you change

15:52.745 --> 16:01.036
your mind, considering the fact that we may not win 
the war, and why did you change your mind, sir?

16:01.056 --> 16:06.583
Well, I still to this day believe we could have won 
the war if it was fought correctly. You've got to

16:08.133 --> 16:12.680
understand, in Vietnam, we fought when the enemy 
wanted to fight us. The enemy, at any time, could

16:14.262 --> 16:20.992
run across the border in the Laos, Cambodia, North 
Vietnam, and we couldn't chase them. We were

16:21.012 --> 16:23.716
restricted to stay in South Vietnam. So they would 
come across at a given time and fight. They would

16:27.161 --> 16:36.975
usually lose that battle, go back across the 
border, retrain, resupply, regroup, and wait

16:27.161 --> 16:36.975
until the time was right to defeat an enemy. You've 
got to go at a center of gravity, and that is the

16:37.883 --> 16:40.106
enemy. You've got to go where the enemy is, and 
you've got to defeat them. If the enemy's in North

16:42.049 --> 16:44.512
Vietnam, you're going to North Vietnam. If it's in 
Laos, you go to Laos. You try to isolate the enemy.

16:48.378 --> 16:57.310
Instead, we were constricted into a boundary 
where the enemy was given sanctuary, where they

16:48.378 --> 16:57.310
could go where we couldn't touch them, and we'd 
have to wait for them to come back in and fight. We

16:59.293 --> 17:02.878
were micromanaged at the highest level, i.e., the 
President of the United States, There were a lot of

17:03.584 --> 17:06.148
things there that really tied our hands. I've made 
time to go on a strike into a village and be shot at

17:06.228 --> 17:17.123
and having Marines killed, but you weren't 
allowed to fire in that village until you got

17:06.228 --> 17:17.123
parents from Saigon to fire. I mean, it was just a 
different type of war. Please understand that the

17:21.669 --> 17:33.405
political situation then was such that I think 
Congress knew what had to be done, but they were so

17:21.669 --> 17:33.405
afraid that if we went into North Vietnam with 
troops, that the Chinese and the Russians may have

17:34.128 --> 17:38.594
come into the war, that they were afraid to do that. 
So they were trying to keep it strictly, but you

17:38.714 --> 17:41.598
know, you can't win a defensive war. We were on the 
defense down here. The only time we could take the

17:43.781 --> 17:47.466
offense is when the enemy took the offense and 
attacked us. And then once we beat them, they ran

17:48.788 --> 17:50.570
across the border. We did bomb across the border, 
but we couldn't do anything. Again, what was the CG

17:54.055 --> 17:58.060
of the Americans in the Vietnam's eyes? What they 
saw was that they had time on their side. They saw

18:02.989 --> 18:07.257
the will of the American people as their center of 
gravity. I think they saw that if they waited long

18:07.277 --> 18:14.030
enough, the American people would not stand for 
our forces to be there, and eventually we would

18:07.277 --> 18:14.030
pull out. And they were right. Sir, do you believe 
that's the whole reason behind the 10th incident?

18:18.037 --> 18:23.122
Because many military analysts have said that the 
Viet Cong were crazy for launching that

18:18.037 --> 18:23.122
offensive. They knew they couldn't win it. Well, 
the Tet Offensive, I think they really thought

18:24.604 --> 18:27.687
they could. If you look at, if you study the Battle 
of Khe Sanh, for example, they saw Khe Sanh as

18:27.707 --> 18:32.332
another din-din food. If you look where Khe Sanh 
was located, it was located up on the northwest

18:32.432 --> 18:36.897
corner of Vietnam. It was about six miles from 
Laos. It was about ten miles south of the DMZ. It was

18:41.502 --> 18:42.383
in a valley. It was surrounded by mountains. It set 
to the west, which were rolling hills that went

18:43.664 --> 18:46.407
into Laos. That offensive normally starts their 
new year in January, and it's right during the

18:46.994 --> 18:53.101
monsoon season. So they say, hey, we bring in 
30,000, 40,000 troops. We surround Quezon. The

18:58.206 --> 18:59.307
monsoons are there. If they can't get the air 
support, we're going to beat them. Quezon only had

19:02.751 --> 19:04.673
the 26 Marines up there. They had about 6,000 to 
7,000 Marines, and they were surrounded by 30,000

19:04.733 --> 19:10.159
to 40,000 NVA troops. Now, these were hardline NVA 
soldiers, not yet conned. They had all kinds of

19:15.108 --> 19:16.971
equipment up there. They had anti-aircraft guns. 
They had artillery. They had rockets. They had

19:20.135 --> 19:20.756
mortars. I was there the night the siege started. I 
was flying medevac out of Quezon on the

19:23.000 --> 19:26.305
surrounding hills. And I recall it was January 21, 
1968. We took 1,600

19:30.691 --> 19:37.922
rounds of artillery at that base that night. We hit 
the ammo dump. The ammo dump took off for 48 hours.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.912
It was just a massive, massive attack. But they 
really felt if they could win that battle, the

19:45.618 --> 19:51.488
Battle of Quezon, the siege, that they would be 
victorious. And the Americans, just like the Dinh

19:51.728 --> 19:58.240
Binh Phu when they beat the French, and the French 
decided it was time to leave Vietnam, they'd had

19:51.728 --> 19:58.240
enough. Well, Lyndon Johnson said we weren't 
going to lose. case on them, and we didn't. It was a

20:06.850 --> 20:10.074
Herculean effort that I think air support saved 
the day. They had B-52 bombers bombing every 90

20:10.094 --> 20:14.681
minutes. And that's what they call an arc light. 
You know an arc light here? Yes, sir. They did have

20:18.626 --> 20:34.288
sometimes 12 to 20 aircraft come over, and each 
B-52 carries 125 500-pound bombs, and they had 20

20:18.626 --> 20:34.288
of those times 125 coming down, and when they hit 
the ground, they looked like an arc of light,

20:18.626 --> 20:34.288
massive. They had air coverage 24 hours a day. Even 
though the weather was bad, they did their radar

20:37.551 --> 20:43.576
bombing using TTQ-10 radars with A6s. And a flight 
of A6s carries 52 500-pound bombs. And this was

20:46.759 --> 20:52.845
going on 24 hours a day around the compound of 
Quezon. The fact is, I make a comparison. Before

20:55.947 --> 20:59.811
the siege started up there, it was a beautiful 
country site up there. I mean, it was luscious

20:59.831 --> 21:01.432
green jungles. They had tigers, monkeys, 
beautiful mountains. jungle canopy. In fact,

21:06.838 --> 21:14.246
right on the south end of the runway there, Cason, 
is a waterfall that dropped down about 200 feet

21:06.838 --> 21:14.246
into the Belong Valley. Just a beautiful setting. 
When that siege was over, it looked like the moon.

21:19.452 --> 21:24.178
There wasn't anything green, just craters for as 
far as you could look. It was massive. So the

21:25.700 --> 21:29.544
Marines officially, I think the record said they 
lost 204. I think we lost about 800, according to

21:30.225 --> 21:34.009
the logs of the the time they stationed up there. 
They say the NVA lost about 10,000, but they don't

21:36.825 --> 21:39.528
know. With a massive bombing, they have lost major 
units. It was massive. That was a big loss to the

21:45.796 --> 21:47.118
South. That was a big loss, I mean, to North 
Vietnam. And I think they really thought that

21:49.761 --> 21:52.745
ahead of 68, they were going to win the war. Then 
they realized they probably weren't, and it

21:52.825 --> 21:56.690
became a matter of a waiting game. Again, you know, 
strike, retreat, strike, retreat. just keep

22:01.057 --> 22:06.623
killing off American troops, people back here 
saying, hey, you know, peace movements, get us out

22:01.057 --> 22:06.623
of there. You know, we've lost 50,000. We don't 
lose any more. What's the cause? You know, the

22:09.986 --> 22:12.508
government down in South Vietnam is corrupt. You 
know, it's time to get out. So in some regards, you

22:14.931 --> 22:20.216
know, I look at the way we're fighting the war, 
we're going to win it. They had to make some major

22:20.236 --> 22:23.599
policy changes for us to win the war. So looking at 
it from that perspective, they're probably smart

22:24.240 --> 22:28.144
with that. from a fighting man that won many 
battles that I hate to say we lost. I understand.

22:39.651 --> 22:50.484
Sir, almost 20 years after the fall of Saigon, 
what, if anything, had you been one of the

22:39.651 --> 22:50.484
politicians and, well, been the President of the 
United States for that matter, would you have done

22:39.651 --> 22:50.484
differently in Vietnam? Well, there are a lot of 
lessons learned. I think if you study history

22:54.168 --> 22:57.152
and... The American people, up until the Korean 
conflict, had only fought unlimited wars. You

23:02.737 --> 23:03.819
know what an unlimited war is. Unconditional 
surrender. You kick ass, you take names, you

23:05.021 --> 23:08.867
destroy the enemy, and you turn over the 
government. But the Cree is the first time this

23:09.808 --> 23:13.974
nation ever fought a limited war, and they didn't 
like it. They weren't used to it. They're not used

23:14.636 --> 23:17.860
to fighting for limited objectives. I think 
Vietnam was the same way, and we didn't know how to

23:18.041 --> 23:22.067
fight limited wars. But if you look at, I think 
George Bush must have had a checklist for Desert

23:27.693 --> 23:32.179
Storm to make sure that everything that happened 
in Vietnam did not happen in Desert Storm. Let me

23:32.199 --> 23:34.061
tell you what I mean. Number one, he declared war. 
He got the will of the American people. He got the

23:40.149 --> 23:43.192
consensus of Congress. He mobilized the 
reserves. Once you mobilize the reserves, you're

23:45.375 --> 23:50.341
mobilizing the citizen soldiers that are getting 
more and more involved into the war. He had a firm

23:52.324 --> 23:54.326
political objective. You know what his objective 
was? It was to kick Kuwaitis correction, the

23:57.680 --> 23:59.582
Iraqis out of Kuwait. That was the objective. What 
was the objective of the Vietnam War? No one really

24:01.985 --> 24:02.626
knew. Campaign for communism, what's that mean?

24:08.594 --> 24:10.396
They knew where the defined boundaries were. It 
wasn't micromanaged by the president. They gave

24:12.859 --> 24:18.186
the total control of the war to military commander 
Schwarzkopf.

24:20.579 --> 24:27.048
There's some other things that I can't think of 
right now, but, I mean, it was done exactly the way

24:20.579 --> 24:27.048
it should have been done. And I think if we'd done 
that same thing in Vietnam, number one, we may not

24:27.088 --> 24:32.136
have gone in the first place. But if we did go, we 
could have won it. Sir, what kind of strategy would

24:37.003 --> 24:46.637
you have implemented in Vietnam had you been in 
charge of all the troops in the country, i.e., the

24:37.003 --> 24:46.637
strategic handling program? No, to me, what I 
would have done is gone and defeated the North

24:47.461 --> 24:51.826
Vietnamese Army. That's what you had to do. 
Vietnam, it was so different than any war we've

24:56.050 --> 24:59.113
ever fought in. You know, you hear, you know, it was 
a guerrilla war. You had conventional forces

25:01.676 --> 25:04.338
fighting. But you've got to understand that when 
we got over there as an American fighting force,

25:04.379 --> 25:15.510
the Viet Cong North NVA infrastructure was 
throughout the South. They control all the

25:16.604 --> 25:21.669
hamlets in the villages, and they did it through 
terrorist tactics. I mean, very easy. If you go

25:22.490 --> 25:31.600
into a village, you hang up the village chief's 
wife on a stake and, you know, cut her open, let her

25:22.490 --> 25:31.600
guts hang out, and people get the message, you 
know, those people are in control. When we came in,

25:33.923 --> 25:41.431
it's not like we started in the south tip of Vietnam 
and just marched all the way north, and everything

25:33.923 --> 25:41.431
behind us we owned. It never happened that way. We 
moved in, we put forces in the north, some in the

25:42.852 --> 25:46.476
central, some in the south, Everywhere we 
physically occupied, we controlled. But all the

25:49.756 --> 25:53.822
area around where we physically occupied, the 
D.C. and the NBA controlled. And even if we would

25:54.543 --> 26:03.437
have started to south and moved north, all they 
would have done is pushed into Cambodia and Laos,

25:54.543 --> 26:03.437
and then as soon as we got further north, they'd 
come in behind us in the south. So you can't win a war

26:03.597 --> 26:06.121
like that. You've got to be able to isolate the 
enemy. We never isolated the enemy. We couldn't.

26:10.147 --> 26:11.449
We had the boundaries put on us. They had no 
boundaries. So what you had to do is find where the

26:14.131 --> 26:18.156
majority of the NVA forces were. They're in North 
Vietnam. You go up there. You can do your blockade.

26:22.361 --> 26:33.916
You can do a big air assault like we did up at Iraq 
where you're going to knock out their bases, their

26:22.361 --> 26:33.916
supply dumps, their SAM sites, anything that's 
strategic. But then you've got to go defeat the

26:33.936 --> 26:35.598
army. You've got to locate the army. You've got to 
beat them. That's how you win wars. And that's what

26:42.367 --> 26:43.328
I would have done. Now, you say, well, that's easy 
to say, Barbette. When you were sent to the White

26:47.159 --> 26:49.681
House, you didn't understand the other 
pressures. Well, I understand the other

26:49.801 --> 26:51.282
pressures. I understand the concern about Russia 
or the Chinese coming into the war. But you've got

26:56.807 --> 27:00.470
to ask yourself, do you want to win the war or not? If 
you want to win the war, you've got to take that

27:01.731 --> 27:03.673
risk. If you didn't want to win the war, then we 
couldn't have been over there. So you don't think

27:07.516 --> 27:10.839
that Fletchmore would have gotten additional 
troops to call for in 1968? No. That wouldn't have

27:11.179 --> 27:12.540
made any difference? Wouldn't have made any 
difference. it would not have made any

27:13.936 --> 27:16.740
difference. Because, again, the troops still, 
you couldn't fight the enemy. The enemy was in

27:19.564 --> 27:22.047
Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam. They only came 
across the border when they wanted to inflict

27:22.308 --> 27:27.014
injury on you, and then they ran. So you think we 
would have lifted the restrictions on operations

27:27.034 --> 27:35.286
in Cambodia, Laos, and North Vietnam? change the 
outcomes here? They would have made a big

27:38.085 --> 27:40.508
difference. They would have made a big 
difference. I even know after the Tet Offensive of

27:42.170 --> 27:46.676
68, we were catching prisoners up in the Khe Sanh 
area. There were kids that were 14 years old. The

27:49.019 --> 27:50.461
NDA soldiers were 14 years old. Their morale was at 
low at that point. They really lost. They really

27:53.726 --> 27:56.890
thought they were going to come down into South 
Vietnam and win. They lost big time. Without the

27:59.393 --> 28:03.058
air power, there's no way they could defeat 
American forces. No way whatsoever. They were

28:05.084 --> 28:06.306
tenacious fighters. They could live in a hole, in a 
tunnel, on a bag of rice for one week. Tough little

28:12.756 --> 28:13.417
guys. I like the Iranians. They didn't quit. They 
were tough little fighters. And I respect them as a

28:18.144 --> 28:22.451
fighting force, but they couldn't beat us. But we 
couldn't beat them either unless we could go fight

28:22.471 --> 28:26.637
their army. We couldn't just wait for them to come 
to us and then let them run away. That's what I'm

28:31.705 --> 28:32.266
saying. The defeat, if you If you look at the... 
I'll make a parallel here to Desert Storm. We

28:40.684 --> 28:41.946
really fought a war of attrition. We fought a war of 
attrition. Basically, the troops that are around

28:45.250 --> 28:54.783
Kuwait, we cut off all their lines of 
communications, all their supply lines. They

28:54.803 --> 28:55.844
couldn't get reinforced. They couldn't even 
communicate with their headquarters. Then we

28:57.566 --> 29:04.015
went up there and bombed all their strategic 
points, all their airfields, all their bases, all

28:57.566 --> 29:04.015
their supply lines. you know, all the 
headquarters and communication sites. So they

29:07.370 --> 29:08.372
were isolated down there. Then the right time 
came, and we surrounded them, and then we went in

29:09.894 --> 29:14.321
and went in for their army and beat them. We had to 
defeat their army. That was just the opposite.

29:19.209 --> 29:20.631
Here in Vietnam, take the battery. Here you've got 
South Vietnam here. Here's our forces in South

29:22.013 --> 29:25.338
Vietnam, but the enemy isn't in South Vietnam. 
They have, yeah, some Forces, small units of

29:27.012 --> 29:32.159
forces there, they're going to keep harassing us 
and firing mortars and rockets. But their main

29:32.239 --> 29:35.063
army is in Cambodia, Laos, and North Vietnam. They 
plan a major offensive. They come across the

29:36.926 --> 29:38.007
border. They attack you. You fight. You win. They 
retreat across the border. And you can't chase

29:44.536 --> 29:45.418
them. You just stop. Then they sit there. They 
regroup. They retrain. They resupply. And when

29:51.386 --> 29:54.370
the timing's right, they come across again. In the 
meantime, they're inflicting harassment

29:54.873 --> 30:08.188
actions all the time through artillery or having 
two or three guys sneak in through a base camp area

29:54.873 --> 30:08.188
and fire a couple of mortars or a 122-round rocket 
or whatever the case might be. So you can see

30:09.670 --> 30:16.398
there's no way we could win unless they just 
decided to give up because they had enough. And

30:16.418 --> 30:18.560
those people, you've got to understand the Asian 
mind. Time is on their side. Sir, historians

30:22.767 --> 30:26.256
debate whether or not we won or lost the war. From 
your perspective, sir, I'd like to hear your

30:26.877 --> 30:32.571
thoughts on that question. My thoughts are, and 
again I...
