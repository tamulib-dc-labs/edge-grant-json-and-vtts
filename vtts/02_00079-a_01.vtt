00:03.035 --> 00:09.521
34123 tape

00:03.035 --> 00:09.521
is running and the light is on. It says it's 
recording.

00:14.105 --> 00:23.419
This is September the 21st, and down in the Wells 
Fargo Bank, and I have the pleasure and honor of

00:14.105 --> 00:23.419
chatting with Dean Gage. We're going to begin 
about his student experiences. Dean, to help a

00:29.027 --> 00:39.042
newcomer understand who this person is, describe 
your experience and all before you got to Texas

00:29.027 --> 00:39.042
A&M. Where did you grow up? high school, what did 
mom and dad do, and then where'd you go that first

00:40.244 --> 00:46.411
year and so forth? Well, I was born and reared in the 
hill country in a small town called San Saba. In

00:53.678 --> 00:55.821
fact, my mom and dad still live there. I was the 
first person from either one of my families, both

00:57.242 --> 01:06.572
sides, to ever go to college or university. And I 
must say that a lot of that probably was stimulated

01:06.974 --> 01:27.615
when I was in about the sixth or seventh grade in 
4-H. And I came to 4-H Roundup at A&M and got to see

01:06.974 --> 01:27.615
the campus for the first time ever on a college or 
university campus. I fortunately was a high point

01:28.051 --> 01:47.325
individual in a contest I want to watch and we had a 
terrific time here and through high school I

01:28.051 --> 01:47.325
really tried to be a high achiever and make grades 
enough that clearly I could go to college if I

01:48.048 --> 01:52.194
wanted to. So I had already come down to A&M and made 
the decision that I was going to study veterinary

01:53.556 --> 01:59.905
medicine. And yet, we had a real financial need in 
my family. I had already taken all the entrance

02:05.653 --> 02:11.862
exams and had been assigned a dormitory and a 
roommate. was ready to come and I got two

02:12.112 --> 02:22.704
substantial scholarships one academic and the 
other for leadership at Tarleton State

02:12.112 --> 02:22.704
University. My family could not pass that kind of 
financial benefit so I went to Tarleton my first

02:22.724 --> 02:39.402
year and roomed with another guy that I knew was 
going to come to A&M because he wanted to study

02:22.724 --> 02:39.402
veterinary medicine and ironically we were both 
state officers in the FFA. And knowing that A&M was

02:43.819 --> 02:51.867
the only veterinary college and knowing that we 
wanted to get here as soon as possible, we

02:43.819 --> 02:51.867
transferred our sophomore year. So I arrived on 
this campus in the fall of 1961 and began as a

02:52.587 --> 03:03.618
student in pre-veterinary medicine at the time.

03:06.702 --> 03:10.165
What did you, when you came, how did you get here and 
what did you bring? I got here with probably one

03:11.377 --> 03:18.250
suitcase and I didn't bring much of anything with 
me because I didn't have hardly anything. I

03:18.270 --> 03:28.910
brought a fan, I will tell you that, because that's 
all we had in the dormitories were electric fans

03:18.270 --> 03:28.910
and it was hot and all you could do is move air around 
a little bit. And did you come in a car, hitchhike,

03:30.593 --> 03:33.238
train? I did not have a car. So I had to ride with 
other boys that were coming to A&M from my

03:34.816 --> 03:40.062
hometown. Describe when you got to the campus, how 
did you find where you needed to be next? How did you

03:47.850 --> 03:49.612
find which dorm? Well, my first semester I lived in 
Law Hall, and I still remember to this day the

03:50.553 --> 04:04.468
assignment of that dormitory, and fortunately my 
good buddy and I were rooming together, and I even

04:04.769 --> 04:22.225
remember my laundry number, GX2095 of all things, 
because students' laundry at that time was even

04:04.769 --> 04:22.225
done on the campus and wrapped up in brown paper, 
and you'd go to the laundry and pick it up. And it was

04:24.107 --> 04:28.190
a real experience coming from a real small town. 
How did you get assigned to law? Do you know? I don't

04:31.573 --> 04:33.375
really recall. except through the student 
housing department somehow. You were in the

04:37.114 --> 04:37.935
corps? No, I was not in the corps because I 
transferred with adequate number of hours and

04:38.416 --> 04:50.070
knew that I was going to be going to veterinary 
college and could receive the commission without

04:38.416 --> 04:50.070
being in the corps. And secondly,

04:50.771 --> 04:56.899
I knew that once I got into veterinary college, I 
could not stay in the corps. because of the time

04:57.520 --> 05:01.303
constraints and the demands that would be upon us. 
I didn't know that option existed then. I did. If

05:04.206 --> 05:16.197
you transferred with, I think, 30 hours or more, I 
never took less than 18 hours a semester.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.598
I'll never forget Law Hall. Describe it. Oh, man, 
those rooms were just kind of like a concrete

05:19.860 --> 05:27.527
cellar that was above ground with no air 
circulation. And every time the train would come

05:28.064 --> 05:33.709
down the tracks, we would know it. And it was a 
community, though, within itself, because you

05:33.729 --> 05:41.116
got to know everybody on your suite and your floor. 
And, you know, it was typical dormitory life. How

05:47.102 --> 05:56.130
did you and your transfer friends get assimilated 
into Aggie traditions and activities? Well, I

05:56.363 --> 06:03.354
think all of us had a pretty good background in what 
that was, and it did not take long to just simply get

05:56.363 --> 06:03.354
involved with campus life. You know, just being 
associated with the other students in classes,

06:04.896 --> 06:12.288
and we never missed Yale practice. We never missed 
muster. We never missed Tuesday nights when we

06:15.834 --> 06:20.802
honored those silver tabs. So we were a part of the 
life just by our own election to be a part of it. And,

06:28.154 --> 06:34.107
you know, it was only about 8,000 students then, so 
you had a lot of friends who were already here. A lot

06:34.127 --> 06:41.322
of my hometown buddies were already here, a lot of 
them in the Corps.

06:45.470 --> 06:59.812
Did anybody

06:45.470 --> 06:59.812
come through the dorm trying to get y'all to do 
anything or participate in anything? No, I don't

07:00.533 --> 07:02.275
think they really had to. I think there was just 
such a uh loyalty of the traditions that we wanted

07:05.095 --> 07:33.280
to be a part of it so no one even really had to ask us 
they probably would ask us not to come because we

07:05.095 --> 07:33.280
were going to be there were their nickname was 
there a nickname for you guys uh not that i remember

07:05.095 --> 07:33.280
i know later on there was a nickname for the people 
who lived in law and puryear but i don't recall that

07:05.095 --> 07:33.280
we had any because let's see you didn't transfer 
into the core So you didn't frog in. That wouldn't

07:35.635 --> 07:36.597
work. And you weren't a day duck. No. What did you 
all wear to class? Generally, we wore a lot of

07:42.325 --> 07:59.350
Western wear back then because so many of my 
classmates and me had mostly boots and either

07:42.325 --> 07:59.350
Levi's or Wranglers and just regular sports 
shirts. But we took pride in how we looked. And we,

08:01.812 --> 08:03.895
you know, dressed up. There were no shorts. There 
were no tank tops and really no T-shirts. We took

08:10.464 --> 08:12.166
pride in how we looked. Plus, all of us who had the 
plans to go to veterinary college knew that once we

08:12.186 --> 08:26.086
entered veterinary college, we were going to be 
wearing a tie and a dress shirt every day or medical

08:12.186 --> 08:26.086
uniforms once we got there. Were there any 
memorable courses you took that first year? Oh

08:30.820 --> 08:32.062
yeah, there were several. I took one in physics 
that was so memorable, mainly because of the

08:32.402 --> 08:42.057
demeanor of the professor in there. I think he had 
three shirts and maybe two ties and he wore them, it

08:42.658 --> 08:48.306
seemed like, every other day. And he was 
red-headed, and one of his ties was brown, the

08:48.286 --> 08:58.564
other was orange, and it just kind of all was a part 
of his esprit de corps. And he was one of these high

08:59.466 --> 09:09.484
intellectuals that could really teach, but to 
carry on a conversation sometimes is a little

08:59.466 --> 09:09.484
difficult. And then I had Dr. Harris in history, 
and he made it very interesting with some of his

09:09.464 --> 09:25.485
stories, particularly about Guadalcanal, and a 
lot of his antics preceded him before we got in

09:09.464 --> 09:25.485
class with him. So in the pre-veterinary, those 
were the two most memorable ones. I'll tell you one

09:32.874 --> 09:35.177
that was memorable was biochemistry. It was a 
tough course, but the reason it's memorable It was

09:38.101 --> 09:44.294
over where the dairy lab was and we always got ice 
cream either before after class free. No, we had to

09:44.815 --> 09:51.509
pay for it and What describe that first year? 
Describe a typical class days routine. What did

09:55.637 --> 09:55.958
you? What time did you get up? What did you do? 
Where? When? Well, we took heavy loads, and I had a

09:58.886 --> 10:05.717
goal of getting into veterinary college in two 
years. So that meant that I'd already had one year

10:06.398 --> 10:21.422
with 36 or 37 transfer hours, and I wanted to 
package into that second year, my first year here

10:06.398 --> 10:21.422
at A&M, my sophomore year, as many hours as I could 
to get the requirements completed so that i could

10:21.402 --> 10:42.617
get in in two years so my days were very long because 
i took 18 19 hours and i i thoroughly though did like

10:21.402 --> 10:42.617
to take the early morning classes and i had most 
eight hour i mean eight o'clock classes of a

10:21.402 --> 10:42.617
morning And by the time you take that many hours, 
you're pretty well filled up with lecture, and

10:42.597 --> 10:51.126
then it's very heavy in the sciences, so I had a lot 
of laboratories. I had organic chemistry,

10:51.146 --> 10:55.350
biochemistry, all of that in the same time frame. 
So the days were packed predominantly with either

10:56.091 --> 11:08.503
lectures or labs, a few hours off in which that was 
time to do the things you had to do, your laundry and

10:56.091 --> 11:08.503
other parts. But I guarantee you we took time out 
for football games, for Yale practice, for the

11:09.226 --> 11:14.878
Aggie activities of the day. We never failed to 
participate in those. But when it got to be 7

11:17.744 --> 11:23.116
o'clock at night, I was studying. I was burning the 
midnight oil. Where did you study? I

11:25.882 --> 11:28.304
predominantly studied in my room. I was fortunate 
to be a person that developed great study habits in

11:29.646 --> 11:33.769
high school. And if I could get it quiet and I could 
take my set of notes and take the book and go through

11:34.830 --> 11:45.721
it and highlight it and mark it, I could memorize 
things by going over it a couple of times. And I

11:46.842 --> 11:50.445
studied mostly in the dormitory. So it was quiet 
enough. It was quiet enough, mm-hmm. And you ate

11:53.945 --> 11:56.609
in? Sebesa. Describe it. Oh, man, there were some 
real food riots, and you can imagine what all

11:59.012 --> 12:06.944
happened in Sebesa and food fights and, you know, 
of course, terrific food there. And all the food

12:07.785 --> 12:19.322
was labeled, as I'm sure many others have already 
told you, and it was just a sight to behold with that

12:07.785 --> 12:19.322
many thousand people in there together eating at 
one time. What was your favorite Aggie food?

12:24.809 --> 12:25.650
Oh, my. Probably chicken fried steak. Was there 
one at the other end of the spectrum that you didn't

12:29.497 --> 12:32.602
like? I did not like meatloaf, and to this day I 
don't like meatloaf. What's the nickname for it? I

12:38.973 --> 12:40.976
don't remember it. Oh, I don't either.

12:44.924 --> 12:46.228
I don't remember what it was. And chicken flapjack 
didn't have a nickname. Not that I know of, unless

12:47.893 --> 12:50.541
it was cow or something. I think it was, I think most 
of the time we had beef, it was called cow or bull. I

12:55.636 --> 12:56.238
don't remember. And bull neck was... What was it? 
Steak, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah. Bullneck was steak.

13:03.710 --> 13:04.572
Yeah, bullneck was steak. And y'all didn't have 
any routine at your table or anything like that?

13:10.448 --> 13:10.669
No. You were civilian students. No, we mainly went 
in. I'll tell you one other thing I remember about

13:13.958 --> 13:16.585
my sophomore year. There were no computers, and 
registration was quite a process because it was

13:17.155 --> 13:23.606
held in Sabeasa. And it was every person for 
themselves, and you know, you knew the reputation

13:24.507 --> 13:40.935
of the different professors, so

13:24.507 --> 13:40.935
you wanted to try to match your schedule to a 
professor that had a good reputation. but you were

13:41.354 --> 14:09.690
at the mercy you had a card with your schedule on it 
and you had to work it out you had to work out the

13:41.354 --> 14:09.690
courses you took you had to work out who the 
professor would be and the times that you took

13:41.354 --> 14:09.690
those so it is a real challenge and you'd go back and 
forth and you know you'd also try to get the same

13:41.354 --> 14:09.690
course schedule your buddies had so it was quite a 
quite an ordeal remember to whom you turned for

13:41.354 --> 14:09.690
advice to be sure you were taking the right course 
yeah i do because uh The university did a good job

14:09.670 --> 14:11.452
there. We had undergraduate advisors, and at that 
time, if we were pre-vet, we actually had someone

14:11.552 --> 14:24.809
in the veterinary college who was an advisor to us 
on the courses that we took. Do you remember who

14:25.971 --> 14:28.173
that was? I do not remember who mine was. But I do 
remember that Dr. McMurray, Associate Dean for

14:31.473 --> 14:40.837
Academic Affairs, helped almost every one of us. 
Compare the rigor of the courses here that year

14:45.378 --> 14:48.282
compared to the previous year at Tarleton? There 
really was very little difference, which

14:48.302 --> 14:52.688
surprised me. I was fortunate to have come from a 
high school that had very, very high standards.

15:01.700 --> 15:06.727
And I was so well prepared for my first year of 
college that I sailed through it. I even had

15:07.107 --> 15:10.812
organic chemistry in high school. And we could go 
into chemistry 101, 102. I didn't even have to do

15:14.258 --> 15:15.841
the experiments. I already knew the answers. And 
my other classmates from my own high school, they

15:17.865 --> 15:21.852
were all in the same boat. So it was rigorous, and 
particularly the biologies. They were harder.

15:29.004 --> 15:33.272
But we had great preparation, and it gave me great 
preparation for here. Let's see, during that year

15:33.978 --> 15:42.283
before vet school, in the dormitory, were there 
any pranks or jokes or? When I was at Tarleton? Or

15:44.994 --> 15:45.455
here? Somebody set a trash can on fire half the 
time. There were water balloon fights. I don't

15:55.070 --> 15:58.315
remember any specific big one. I tell you what, 
most of us trying to get into veterinary college,

15:58.575 --> 16:07.309
we had such a fear that if we got involved in 
anything, that we might not get in. And at that

16:07.289 --> 16:14.300
time, they only took 64 students, and they were 
having about 600 applications. So we pretty well

16:15.141 --> 16:18.826
walked a straight and narrow path. Now, there was 
no formal organization of the pre-vets. No. There

16:23.854 --> 16:32.086
was a prescribed pre-veterinary medical track, 
but not like now where you have a biomedical

16:23.854 --> 16:32.086
science degree. It was clearly different then. 
We're still for a few minutes talking only about

16:35.065 --> 16:43.126
your second year of college, first one here. What 
did you assume were the rules of classroom

16:44.569 --> 16:51.808
behavior here at A&M? It was clear that the 
professor was keen of the classroom, and you gave

16:53.138 --> 17:05.057
that professor utmost respect. You called the 
professor, yes, sir, or if it was a lady, you called

17:07.101 --> 17:16.236
them, yes, ma'am, or addressed them that way, sir 
and ma'am, and yes, sir, yes, ma'am. You were in

17:17.177 --> 17:20.142
class on time and in your seat. If not, you were 
really afraid to walk in late. There was great

17:25.319 --> 17:29.283
respect and complete discipline. You did not talk 
in class. You paid attention. You took notes. But

17:35.970 --> 17:38.113
at the same time, they were approachable. They 
were friendly. They were helpful. And they had a

17:40.695 --> 17:42.457
heart to see us learn. And they had, I think, a real 
interest in what we were trying to pursue as a

17:43.398 --> 17:48.524
degree. And that was really noted in some of the 
tough courses. Organic chemistry, for one. most

17:55.863 --> 18:16.538
of the organic chemistry professors had a 
reputation of being tough and hard but at the same

17:55.863 --> 18:16.538
time they were very fair and they were very helpful 
and one of them and I will never forget this his name

17:55.863 --> 18:16.538
was Rakoff and he had the reputation of and I had 
him, of coming in and passing out a major exam and

18:17.294 --> 18:27.344
telling you what his dog made on that exam. And I 
made A's in organic, but the poor guy next to me, on

18:28.406 --> 18:42.340
one of the exams, he passed it out, and he said his 
dog made 48 on it, and the guy next to me made 24. And

18:42.320 --> 18:49.167
it was tough, but it was fair. Did the MSC have any 
role in that year in your life pattern? You'd be

18:57.415 --> 19:02.000
surprised what I would say about the MSC because it 
was quite small back then. The major thing it had,

19:02.060 --> 19:10.588
one, it had the only telephones where you could 
make long-distance phone calls. And secondly is

19:10.788 --> 19:14.454
the only place I knew where you could go cash a 
check. As far as the MSC programs, I really was not

19:16.178 --> 19:23.871
involved in those simply because I didn't have 
time and I was trying to get in in two years. And I

19:24.392 --> 19:30.062
really devoted most of my time to trying to make the 
highest grades I could. they

19:30.430 --> 19:55.071
were at the Grove and and I'm trying to remember was 
Guyon Hall still there in 61 I believe it was I don't

19:30.430 --> 19:55.071
remember ever going to a movie in Guyon Hall but I 
went to some movies over at the Grove what about you

19:30.430 --> 19:55.071
go to campus theater much a few times and then we 
went downtown brian to the old palace and queen and

19:55.355 --> 20:21.447
and i'll tell you what to eat in this town you only 
had a few

19:55.355 --> 20:21.447
places other than a few places in northgate uh the 
wormans downtown young bloods uh you went to

19:55.355 --> 20:21.447
barbecue which was I think over kind of where the 
Hilton Hotel is now. That was it. And the Texan was

20:26.563 --> 20:28.787
the drive-in. Texan was the drive-in, and I got to 
tell you one more. That was the Tasty Freeze. And

20:34.037 --> 20:41.511
every night at 1030, we often would go in some of the 
cars, we'd drive over the Tasty Freeze, and we

20:34.037 --> 20:41.511
would get a Frito Pie, which was made by taking a bag 
of Fritos, pouring cheese, onions, and stirring

20:41.761 --> 20:56.235
it up into a Frito Pie. And that was it. The Frosted 
Mugs.

21:03.842 --> 21:07.866
Did you get involved in any campus religious 
activities? I did at the Baptist Church College

21:07.886 --> 21:09.928
Station.

21:13.469 --> 21:17.833
But on Saturdays, I went to school church. I never 
failed. It was one church

21:18.634 --> 21:26.761
behind me.

21:33.687 --> 21:43.155
It

21:33.687 --> 21:43.155
was a veterinary

21:47.270 --> 21:56.946
after church one day and asked me if I wanted a date 
with his sister for the Arkansas football game.

21:56.966 --> 22:04.217
And of course I didn't have a date and there were no 
girls or very few girls here at the time and I said

21:56.966 --> 22:04.217
sure. So that's where it's starting. Really? It 
really is. Describe that weekend date then. Well,

22:14.405 --> 22:17.169
actually I was already in veterinary college. I 
was in my second year. That's all right. Go ahead.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.995
And she was, of all places, the University of 
Texas. But she had wanted to come to A&M but could

22:22.797 --> 22:27.924
not come to A&M because girls were not allowed. But 
her oldest brother was here and he arranged and

22:28.865 --> 22:38.779
called her that, yeah, come on over. And she 
brought a friend with her from the University of

22:39.019 --> 22:42.724
Texas. And I had a roommate that needed a date. So we 
were in the MSC lobby waiting on them to arrive on

22:48.551 --> 22:53.856
Friday afternoon. And when she started walking 
up, the two of them, I should say, I looked at both of

22:55.237 --> 23:09.530
them and I said, I hope that that one on the right is 
his sister because I didn't want to go with the

22:55.237 --> 23:09.530
other one. And sure enough, it was. And it was a 
wonderful time that we had together. Had you seen a

23:15.483 --> 23:16.764
picture of her before? No, I had not. So I wasn't 
sure. So we went to old Coach Norton's restaurant

23:19.648 --> 23:29.781
Friday night and had dinner. And we just began to 
hit it off. She stayed with the Heaton's, who was

23:32.604 --> 23:36.589
registrar here. she had known their daughter at 
University of Texas, Kathleen. So that's where

23:42.045 --> 23:51.075
she stayed that night, and then the next day we went 
to the football game, and I don't remember all that

23:42.045 --> 23:51.075
we did, but we went to the football game. Of course, 
A&M did not win. Did they score any touchdowns,

23:53.278 --> 23:55.500
though? I don't think so. We almost were at point of 
kissing on first downs back then. As a student, I

24:00.326 --> 24:03.950
never saw a winning football season. Oh, that's 
right. Never. the whole time I was a student here.

24:08.833 --> 24:17.445
And only the year after I left, which would have 
been the 67th football season, they won the

24:08.833 --> 24:17.445
conference. So I never saw that until I came back 
here as a faculty member. But did you kiss this girl

24:22.051 --> 24:24.415
on that? I kissed her on the first night. On that 
first date? I did. Do you remember among your

24:30.723 --> 24:33.407
friends, of that era, do you remember hearing any 
stories of inappropriate behavior of Aggies and

24:34.180 --> 24:43.794
blind dates? No, never. Aggies were taught, and I 
think that this is something that is very true of

24:46.437 --> 24:59.496
the values that were inculcated in most Aggies and 
are still coming predominantly from their homes

25:00.640 --> 25:07.548
and families, that they were taught to respect 
women and ladies. And I never heard of any of that at

25:08.469 --> 25:11.332
all. I never saw any of it. Generalize about the 
attitudes of the students at A&M that you think

25:13.215 --> 25:24.808
they possessed at that time? I really think they 
came with a tremendous conservative value system

25:27.657 --> 25:40.432
that placed a high priority on God, family, and 
country. Most of us at that time were offsprings of

25:41.714 --> 25:46.600
World War II veterans. Not only World War II 
veterans, but parents who lived through the

25:55.366 --> 26:07.545
ending years of the Great Depression and the 
enormous sacrifices that many of them made to be

25:55.366 --> 26:07.545
able to send us to college. And we had probably such 
a grateful heart for what our families and our

26:07.946 --> 26:17.341
parents had provided us. We also came here with a 
commitment that we would not let them down.

26:24.020 --> 26:25.882
because we knew it was a sacrifice. And I can 
remember, particularly when I got into

26:26.762 --> 26:44.098
veterinary college my first year, that near the 
end of the semester, every once in a while, I would

26:26.762 --> 26:44.098
have to sell a textbook to have enough money to eat 
for the rest of the semester. Do you remember what

26:44.498 --> 26:47.080
that first year cost in round numbers? Oh, I have no 
idea, but I'll tell you what I remember about

26:47.180 --> 26:51.164
tuition in my freshman year. It was $40 a semester. 
My first year here at A&M, everyone just went

26:54.412 --> 27:05.686
berserk because it doubled to $80 a semester, 
regardless of the number of hours that you took.

27:07.068 --> 27:23.288
And I really don't recall it going up a great deal in 
61, I mean in 62, but when I entered veterinary

27:07.068 --> 27:23.288
college,

27:07.068 --> 27:23.288
that was a little higher tuition rate. I don't 
remember what that was. Did you have spending

27:25.821 --> 27:28.632
money? And if so, where'd you get it? I had very 
little spending money. Most of my spending money

27:32.748 --> 27:34.695
was for food. And, you know, I had a little, and then 
I got it predominantly from my mom and dad. I later,

27:42.271 --> 27:49.639
when I was in veterinary college, worked at the 
large animal hospital and was able to pick up a

27:42.271 --> 27:49.639
little bit of money there. Now, before you made 
that formal application to vet school, who did you

27:49.659 --> 27:55.586
turn to for advice and counsel on how to do it? It was 
pretty well prescribed by the dean's office in the

27:57.188 --> 28:02.995
veterinary medical college. And then I had a dear 
friend who was a former state congressman from San

28:03.734 --> 28:11.881
Angelo named Penrose Metcalf. And he had helped 
young men for probably 30, 40, 50 years. He was an

28:19.328 --> 28:20.128
Aggie. And I had gotten to know him because of my 
state leadership roles in high school. And he

28:28.175 --> 28:33.420
seemed to pick out young men who were in leadership 
roles in high school that he thought would make a

28:34.025 --> 28:36.589
good student at A&M. And he really helped guide and 
would tell me things I needed to do, particularly

28:36.669 --> 28:45.444
not having parents that knew the ropes of what to do 
in a college or university setting. And then

28:46.185 --> 28:52.776
secondly, my hometown veterinarian gave me some 
counsel and advice on some certain things to do.

28:53.738 --> 28:57.484
And then I just was fortunate to have high enough 
grades that I was one of the first 13 to get letters

28:58.156 --> 29:04.706
out of that 64 selected in that class. Do you 
remember what your GPA was? It was a 3.8. 3.8. Other

29:10.616 --> 29:19.109
than the paper application, what else was 
involved in the process of selection? Well, I was

29:19.129 --> 29:23.556
fortunate because at that time, They would take 
the first few highest ones based upon what their

29:24.785 --> 29:38.565
academic performance was, what their grades were 
in the hard science courses, the biologies, the

29:24.785 --> 29:38.565
physics, the organic. And secondly, they looked 
at what your leadership had been. And I had a pretty

29:44.894 --> 29:52.986
substantial resume of leadership, even my first 
year at Tarleton. I was elected president of the

29:53.320 --> 29:58.887
student FFA chapter up there. I'd been on the 
collegiate livestock judging team and had some

29:58.967 --> 30:05.636
other position of leadership. So that was part of 
my resume coming to it. I didn't even have to have an

30:10.062 --> 30:11.924
interview. Now, when they got to about the last 
half of that class of 64, then they did do

30:12.285 --> 30:18.934
interviews. And, of course, now they interview 
every student. How did you learn you'd been

30:21.485 --> 30:23.888
selected? I'll never forget this. Everyone was 
waiting. We'd heard the letters were going to come

30:27.854 --> 30:29.937
out. I had gone home for the weekend and I came back 
and the first thing I did when I got back on campus

30:30.037 --> 30:45.899
was to go to the post office at Northgate and open my 
mailbox and there was the letter from Dean Price.

30:47.060 --> 30:48.302
And you can imagine I probably didn't take more 
than 10 steps jumping all the way to the MSC to call

30:48.805 --> 30:54.552
my mom and dad. I still have that letter to this day. 
And that was about when in the spring? That would

31:02.281 --> 31:10.591
have been probably about April of the spring 
semester. Of course, that was contingent upon

31:10.611 --> 31:17.800
successful completion of the courses I was 
enrolled in. And what did you do that summer? I went

31:21.849 --> 31:23.013
back home and worked. On the farm? On the farm and 
ranch. Helped my dad, which I had done every

31:26.545 --> 31:30.237
summer.
