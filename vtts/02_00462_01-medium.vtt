WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:04.770
Go back to question one. When and where were you in 
Vietnam? 67 to late 68. We were boarded from

00:10.656 --> 00:17.804
Seattle, Washington to Battalion. We spent about 
21 days going across. We landed in the Philippine

00:22.508 --> 00:27.153
Islands, Subi Beach. From there, it was about 
three days. And we landed in Bontown. It's about

00:33.644 --> 00:34.986
15, 20 miles from Saigon. From there, we were 
airlifted to Bengua, which at that time, Bengua

00:36.548 --> 00:47.603
was just an airstrip in 1967. Later, it was 
expanded. When I came back, we flew out of Bengua,

00:49.326 --> 00:59.400
and it was more like a big airstrip.

01:01.372 --> 01:12.926
Then while we went into a

01:01.372 --> 01:12.926
long time, the base camp there was known as Bear 
Camp, home of the 9th Infantry. It was a division

01:12.946 --> 01:16.169
coming from Kansas City to Kansas. And you 
probably recall the mobile airlift. OK, that was a

01:19.714 --> 01:24.799
division that was airlifted from Kansas in 1966. 
So we went there as a supporting unit to back up the

01:26.822 --> 01:31.227
Thailand soldiers coming in from Thailand. 
Before we got there, it was just junk. That was it.

01:38.675 --> 01:41.380
We went in there to clear the area for them. And 
late, uh, back in early September, that's when the

01:41.400 --> 01:50.233
base camp was already secured. And they came in 
under, Westmoreland was there. He was the guy that

01:55.481 --> 01:57.163
brought them in. And from there, we just did our 
regular

01:57.734 --> 02:08.129
search, destroyed. Our firefighters came about 
30, 40 miles from that area. We protected more

02:13.557 --> 02:23.792
mainly the long, thin properties, which was Cuxi,

02:13.557 --> 02:23.792
Bensal, La Trang. Six or seven different 
families. A lot of them were just villages.

02:30.495 --> 02:33.158
Highway 1 was just a dirt road. You know, you could 
just, maybe one vehicle at a time. When we left, I

02:39.787 --> 02:44.633
left way back in 68, May 68. The road was expanded, 
maybe where you could have two vehicles. And it was

02:52.548 --> 02:59.178
mainly for, there was no one-way tracks. 
Everything was there. We had the personal

03:01.461 --> 03:09.072
carriers running around, the artillery, tanks, 
everything. Engineering equipment was going all

03:09.092 --> 03:13.118
over the place. And some of those things happened. 
Okay. How did you feel at the time, back in 66, 67,

03:21.794 --> 03:28.283
when you went to serve in Vietnam, what you were 
doing? In 66, 65, really, I was going to school.

03:34.893 --> 03:37.677
Then after, I dropped out. When I went to work in the 
40s. So I ended up in Chicago. working with Western

03:44.654 --> 03:48.238
Vet Company. But all this time, I knew about the 
Vietnam War, what was going on, or the war. And when

03:55.066 --> 04:02.714
the draft started to come around, and I knew I was 
going to be up to it. In fact, I even received a

04:02.734 --> 04:07.339
letter from President Johnson. I went ahead and 
volunteered the draft. And I came all the way to

04:10.022 --> 04:12.045
McAllen. I could have come from upstate. But I knew 
there was a lot of guys here that were going to be

04:15.383 --> 04:21.590
also drafted. So I tried to come down to Macau or 
West Lake, or Mercedes and maybe get it, I mean, go

04:21.610 --> 04:32.381
as a buddy system type. But going into the war or 
going into the Vietnam crisis, that was, I think

04:32.401 --> 04:42.792
what I was just looking for, to go in there and help 
out. or be part of it. There was no doubt in my mind I

04:46.827 --> 04:52.578
was gonna let down or I was gonna find an excuse to 
get out of it. You know another thing that a lot of us

04:53.460 --> 05:03.379
that served, or my age, we came from a military 
family background. My uncle served in World War II

05:03.399 --> 05:05.303
Korea. So that's had to do a lot with our attitude, 
pointing to this thing here, being patriotic to

05:06.717 --> 05:14.206
the cause. And probably being because of 
Americano, Chicano heritage, we kind of look up to

05:15.527 --> 05:26.881
keeping our own traditions going. And I think most 
of the Mexicans that served, that I knew from

05:26.901 --> 05:33.889
California, Nevada, all the Southwest had the 
same feeling. You know, there was never a guy in my

05:34.257 --> 05:43.030
mind that when we went out on patrol that wanted to 
cop out. We all stayed together. There were about

05:46.735 --> 05:47.897
four or five of us. But talking to some of the guys in 
different areas, they had the same feeling. And

05:53.044 --> 05:54.987
the same thing went for the blacks and the whites. I 
mean, we were all working together. We made 66, 67,

05:56.970 --> 06:03.960
68 people there who had no resent against what we 
were doing there. I think we all believed that we

06:06.069 --> 06:11.816
were doing it for one reason, and that we were 
serving the country. And they were living to those

06:13.158 --> 06:23.871
standards that were laid back by other 
generations. They had served in World War II,

06:23.891 --> 06:33.002
South Pacific, across Europe. Maybe that's the 
way I feel, and I still feel the same way. If I had to

06:38.385 --> 06:42.349
do it again, hey, I would go back and I would 
probably do the same thing. You mentioned that

06:43.410 --> 07:00.306
some of your friends around here felt pretty bad 
they were rejected by the... You know, as a matter

06:43.410 --> 07:00.306
of fact, a lot of us, I still remember very vividly 
when we left McCallum and we were in the VTC bus was

07:01.940 --> 07:05.244
provided for us. A lot of them were rejected. They 
didn't want to come back. They felt bad about it.

07:14.437 --> 07:16.499
They wanted to stay. They wanted to stay. What was 
the reason behind that? Can you explain that? The

07:21.686 --> 07:24.530
guy was rejected. Physically? Yeah. Why? Why they 
felt bad? Well, they felt that...

07:32.888 --> 07:40.759
I guess peer pressure,

07:32.888 --> 07:40.759
the way we were raised. Most of the guys that I knew 
were athletes. We played ball together. We did all

07:47.908 --> 07:49.150
those things in school.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.963
Did you think you played an important role in 
Vietnam?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.817
Well, yeah, I think so. First thing that, you know, 
from my own personal view and the way I was raised,

08:05.078 --> 08:22.277
you know, being there and seeing what I saw with the 
people there, it's kind of like seeing yourself

08:05.078 --> 08:22.277
back home, you know, with poverty.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.263
The whole life standards maybe you can say 20, 30 
years behind that time compared to the United

08:28.255 --> 08:35.264
States. So coming from our area, you could see 
that, hey, this is the same thing that could happen

08:35.364 --> 08:43.314
back in the States. Poverty,

08:45.176 --> 08:55.950
the whole aspect was just trying to help people 
over there and maybe show them, hey, We are here to

08:57.230 --> 09:08.667
help you, and if you understand our ways, maybe we 
can overthrow whatever the government is trying

08:57.230 --> 09:08.667
to take over you guys. Basically, that's what it 
is. The economic aspect.

09:15.537 --> 09:23.389
What I saw there, and the things we were trying to 
accomplish is, I think basically it was to help the

09:15.537 --> 09:23.389
village people. even if we could just educate them 
a little bit and and work on their own necessity you

09:25.597 --> 09:54.895
know survive

09:25.597 --> 09:54.895
that's what i kind of transpired to or i wanted to 
leave that behind you know not necessarily the

09:25.597 --> 09:54.895
american gi or because we had australians there 
people from korea and thailand they were all doing

09:25.597 --> 09:54.895
that for the same cause, helping the people. I 
think that was my main idea was we were there, and

10:00.740 --> 10:10.271
we're going to treat these people here like we 
treated our own back home. But being from the

10:12.073 --> 10:18.420
Valley, did you find things, was it easier to 
relate to these people who were poor? Yeah, well,

10:18.460 --> 10:23.025
you could always see yourself, like, Since we're 
close to Mexico, and you're almost different, the

10:23.765 --> 10:38.141
same atmosphere about going across the border and 
seeing the things that happen there is the same

10:23.765 --> 10:38.141
thing that happens in undeveloped countries. And 
basically, that's how we see those people there.

10:44.528 --> 10:51.696
Exactly, if you go across right now, go to those 
villages out there, you see the same thing right

10:44.528 --> 10:51.696
now. And that's how I think it was a carry over 
10,000 miles away from here. And basically,

10:59.871 --> 11:02.435
that's how we look things up. I mean, people that 
came from the valley. We had other guys that, of

11:06.222 --> 11:08.846
course, came from the Middle States. They 
couldn't understand that. because of their

11:11.943 --> 11:13.845
background. But I think the Mexicans that went 
over there had a better understanding of why these

11:13.865 --> 11:29.665
people were living the way they did. Basically, it 
was education had to play a vital part. People

11:34.492 --> 11:35.453
tried to understand. What did you think of the US 
military during the war when you were over there?

11:42.082 --> 11:49.333
The military aspect I think was very strong, very, 
very strong feelings. We were there and we felt

11:49.353 --> 11:56.283
that we were the best.

11:58.146 --> 12:07.520
That the army, that the whole armed forces were 
very, not rigid, but strong. Nothing was gonna

12:07.560 --> 12:10.384
stop us. We had the power, we had the knowledge. I 
think the most important part was being patriotic

12:16.929 --> 12:23.174
to the cause. You wanted to be part of that. I feel 
that every person that served at that time felt the

12:27.618 --> 12:36.446
same way. I don't recall, none of those guys are 
about the riots going back on or anything like

12:42.173 --> 12:49.040
that. We felt very strong about the armed forces. 
And we felt like, hey, we're part

12:52.743 --> 12:57.628
of it. Did you encounter any problems in Vietnam 
because you were a Chicano or Hispanic?

13:07.137 --> 13:08.459
Not in Vietnam. There was a little bit of it here in 
the States. basic training for the poor

13:11.857 --> 13:16.383
population. Most of your Hispanics went to Fort 
Paul. And it was, you know, maybe you can call it

13:23.492 --> 13:27.377
little things. It was in the enlistment 
personnel. And of course, you're gonna have names

13:32.364 --> 13:40.935
calling, you know, a greaser, and gringo, and 
negro, black. But mainly it was under that range of

13:41.692 --> 13:49.319
the young guys, the 18, 19 years old. Not from the 
superiors? Not from the high rank, or the people

13:50.360 --> 13:56.186
that were there, the drill sergeants. And if they 
did call you, it was trying to see how much pressure

13:58.528 --> 14:07.877
you could take, or see what was your response to 
something like that. I think it was just more

14:07.958 --> 14:10.500
trying to test you. You know, I was called dirty 
Mexican. And I didn't respond back to him when I was

14:17.203 --> 14:21.630
taking this surgery. I think it had to do with how we 
were raised, you know, from my home, you know, with

14:21.650 --> 14:29.182
a lot of respect and stuff like that. And we knew 
that the real surgeon was going to come after us

14:29.202 --> 14:38.756
hard, trying to weave out the guy that was, you 
know, not supportive towards us. But that's the

14:38.776 --> 14:40.639
only encounter I had. as, you know, 
discrimination. But I don't call it

14:43.801 --> 14:45.783
discrimination. It was more like harassment. But 
in Vietnam there was more unity? Vietnam was a

14:50.430 --> 14:52.233
completely different thing. It was more like 
we're a family back there. You know, we stick

14:58.261 --> 15:00.865
together. You could tell black, brown, white. 
Man, in fact, most of my best buddies were white.

15:10.758 --> 15:11.379
Blacks. We all drank together. We drank together, 
we slept together, and fought together. And we

15:18.488 --> 15:20.851
protected each other. We were very close. We 
volunteered. When one guy volunteered for my

15:25.117 --> 15:27.440
squad, everybody wanted to volunteer.

15:30.945 --> 15:32.126
We all wanted to be together. We went to a village 
for recreation. We went for recreation. We kind of

15:40.205 --> 15:43.208
looked pretty short. We wrote letters. Some guys 
couldn't write, so I would sit down with them and I

15:44.670 --> 15:49.876
would write the letters. I know a guy from Utah, 
John Baswell.

15:55.182 --> 15:55.682
John Bowen. He couldn't write. It was about nine 
years old. So I used to write his letters. You know,

16:03.831 --> 16:06.655
just mine. So I took care of his quality. Of course, 
I was 21 years old, so I was considered a little bit

16:10.107 --> 16:13.132
older. So I was 17, 18 years old. So they look up to my 
age, I guess, because I was a little bit older, like

16:15.415 --> 16:20.783
the big brother type. And I was a little bit more 
mature. I took care of those little kids. The

16:27.633 --> 16:33.862
youngest was a kid from North Carolina, Billy 
Graham. He was 17 years

16:34.584 --> 16:38.850
old. You know, he always He always wanted to be with 
me, because he knew that I was very disciplined on

16:40.718 --> 16:45.765
my ways. I wanted to come back home. I was married, 
and I had a little girl back home. And I told the guy,

16:51.733 --> 16:56.499
hey, man, I got something to go home. So I guess that 
kind of helped him out. They took care of what we

16:59.123 --> 17:03.328
were trying to do. So there was no drug fit. And if 
there were drugs, they hide it. Nothing like back

17:09.254 --> 17:11.897
in the 70s, whatever. 67, 68, we were very serious 
about the war. I know the American soldiers. What

17:19.465 --> 17:20.907
was there was very serious.

17:24.531 --> 17:31.158
I don't think casualties-wise were that 
prolonged tremendously way back in those years.

17:31.178 --> 17:32.359
We were very careful about it. People got careless 
maybe later in the late part of the Vietnam War.

17:41.316 --> 17:56.934
But, you know, talking from experience, I don't 
think we, casualty-wise,

17:41.316 --> 17:56.934
was not because we were careless, you know, what we 
were doing. We were trained, and I think we went

17:56.954 --> 18:03.882
ahead and performed like people wanted us to 
perform. doing our job. And nothing, we gave it

18:08.851 --> 18:10.913
100%. That's what we're working on. How have your 
views changed since the time you were in Vietnam,

18:17.960 --> 18:22.204
if any? To the press? Yeah.

18:28.710 --> 18:31.432
You know, here we were in 1986. 1966 is 20 years ago. 
To me,

18:36.177 --> 18:46.048
you can see it and you can break it down into two 
parts. When I came back, it's

18:46.068 --> 19:05.188
not hate, but it was something that people were 
blaming the American soldier for something that

18:46.068 --> 19:05.188
they were doing that on reality can be happening 
right now. to our own people. But

19:06.654 --> 19:20.813
I guess the only people that can understand that 
face is the soldier that was there, that

19:06.654 --> 19:20.813
understands that Vietnam, that war is not just 
fighting. You have to fight all kinds of things.

19:24.257 --> 19:28.964
Poverty is one thing.

19:28.984 --> 19:29.564
Abuse. That's part of war. The nearest people 
never bring their stuff out. They always tell you

19:38.059 --> 19:40.062
how many guys died. They never tell you what it's 
called behind the scenes. And that's what's

19:44.168 --> 19:45.270
worse. When I look at people taking advantage of 
what we have, which is freedom, they really don't

19:46.952 --> 20:00.572
know what they have

19:46.952 --> 20:00.572
until they lose it. And that's telling you that 
some guy coming in and saying, hey, tomorrow

20:01.295 --> 20:07.240
you're going to die. That's what I'm talking 
about. And I hope it will never happen here, but

20:10.763 --> 20:16.828
something like that bothers me. We have Nicaragua 
today. And I always have felt it. And Vietnam was an

20:23.714 --> 20:27.697
example for us. We could have stopped communist 
aggression there. If the politicians only knew

20:32.632 --> 20:40.301
what goes on the battlegrounds, they don't know. 
They need to be there. Then they will probably

20:42.403 --> 20:50.252
realize, hey, if we don't stop them right there, 
1,500 miles from here, hey, they're going to be

20:42.403 --> 20:50.252
right there behind our back door. I guarantee you 
that. That's the way it works. And we had a chance in

20:54.757 --> 20:57.240
Vietnam. And Vietnam was 10,000 miles away from 
home. Now we're down 1,500 miles. And that's

21:03.428 --> 21:04.089
scary. That is scary. So I don't know what can 
happen.

21:11.718 --> 21:15.683
I don't know, maybe they envy the American people. 
Maybe they envy the American lifestyle. I think

21:19.027 --> 21:24.094
they do. You know, it's, communist people, 
communists, they hate the American GI. I know

21:33.263 --> 21:37.849
that. And I don't know if you've heard 
commentaries from Libya or Castro,

21:37.869 --> 21:53.188
and they say our dream is to come and conquer the 
American people. They will not destroy it,

21:55.450 --> 22:00.857
because they want to take it as intact, because we 
have built so much. They're not going to bum it out.

22:04.311 --> 22:04.992
They're not going to blow it. They want to take it 
while they're serving people because they like

22:05.672 --> 22:11.879
what we do. And talking about being 20 years and 
thinking now about what we have, we don't protect

22:11.899 --> 22:22.391
it now. And here we got a lot of young people coming 
out, young men. And you ask them about the armed

22:28.378 --> 22:32.042
services, Hey, they have a very negative 
attitude. They have a very negative attitude. But

22:37.675 --> 22:46.546
if you ask them, do you enjoy lifestyle, about the 
American lifestyle, that someone will nod their

22:37.675 --> 22:46.546
head and some guys can't even answer to. Because 
you know what you're going to ask them next time. If

22:49.890 --> 22:52.493
we enjoy peace, hey, we're going to pay the price 
for it. Even if you have to give your life out there.

22:58.159 --> 22:58.840
Somebody has to. But again, it's not fair that only 
a very few can do it, where others can relax back and

23:01.267 --> 23:12.062
enjoy the rest of their lives. And that's what 
worries me, and that's what I think upsets me a lot.

23:17.369 --> 23:18.991
The Vietnam crisis had to do a lot with it. You know, 
deformative, college deformatives, rev

23:19.953 --> 23:24.779
dodgers. All those people now are 42, 43, 44, 45 
years old. Some of those guys are in Congress right

23:28.885 --> 23:31.088
now. But if you ask them, what were you when Vietnam 
was going on and what the heck were you doing?

23:43.206 --> 23:49.012
They give you a negative attitude or a negative 
answer.

23:49.813 --> 23:55.298
I've talked

23:49.813 --> 23:55.298
to ex-people. They can never give you a straight 
answer. Not now. And they never will. Maybe they

24:02.017 --> 24:06.341
were ashamed of me, you know. Say, hey, I have heard 
people say, hey, I wanted to go, but they never

24:06.361 --> 24:13.889
called for me. You know. And I ask, but hey, I didn't 
call. I mean, I got a call, but hey, I went ahead and

24:18.234 --> 24:21.717
took it. I said, I'm willing to go now. I took the 
risk. And maybe people don't want to do that

24:27.303 --> 24:29.425
nowadays. They're afraid to take the number one 
step. Serve your country. And I guarantee you,

24:37.926 --> 24:42.911
you'll feel better about it. My family, they're 
very proud. They're very proud that I served. They

24:50.100 --> 24:52.943
have never given me a negative attitude. They have 
never said, why did I serve? I think their own

24:56.527 --> 25:00.812
reasonings or their own views, the way I feel, is 
carried on to my daughters, you know, because they

25:01.332 --> 25:09.100
want to pursue into the armed forces. So, and then I 
guess the tradition has been carried on from my

25:11.021 --> 25:20.631
father to the military. Okay. You had two brothers 
in Vietnam, two other brothers that served in

25:21.231 --> 25:24.735
Vietnam. Did they have the same reasons for being 
out there? Basically, it was the same reasons that

25:28.739 --> 25:31.221
I just finished telling you. He was the family 
background. My other brother's twin brother.

25:39.759 --> 25:44.345
And we always compete, athletics, school, 
whatever. But I always have felt that the reason he

25:45.467 --> 25:49.873
went to Vietnam because I had served. And he was in 
college, and he could stay. And he was a junior in

25:54.239 --> 25:58.525
Pan American when he decided to join. And I was 
still there. I was in Vietnam in 68. He was in the

26:02.669 --> 26:07.214
court place in Paso in 68. When I got back, as soon as 
I got back, he put a 1049, go Vietnam. And he went, he

26:15.284 --> 26:21.291
was here.

26:21.311 --> 26:23.094
And then he came back. I was in school. I went back to 
school on the GI. And talking about competing, I

26:27.108 --> 26:31.413
was behind by two years. So I told him, when he got 
back, hey, I challenge you. I want to try to finish

26:35.297 --> 26:38.460
school before you do. And he only had about a month 
to go, or maybe a semester. But anyway, he went

26:42.445 --> 26:48.231
ahead and graduated in May, and I graduated in 
August. And my other brother, he's the youngest,

26:48.251 --> 26:55.579
he also volunteered.

26:57.415 --> 26:58.336
He served in Korea. And then he, at that time, my 
brother was in Vietnam. So I guess for reasons, as

27:02.100 --> 27:10.951
soon as he left Vietnam, he also served. One of them 
had served. So we had three brothers, myself and

27:13.954 --> 27:16.618
two more. And my family never did complain. My mom 
never did protest or never wrote the

27:19.501 --> 27:27.270
congressman's here or the representative about 
having three sons serve in Vietnam. I guess my dad

27:28.111 --> 27:35.401
never wanted that.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.385
And he never did brag about it. No, he died two years 
ago. And he never said, when we all came back, he

27:40.768 --> 27:46.596
never said nothing about how was the war.

27:49.840 --> 27:55.688
I guess he, on his own ways of doing things, he felt 
proud. And of course, all his brothers were

27:56.663 --> 27:59.045
veterans. So I guess that's how he pictured the 
whole thing. That tradition is still what's going

28:04.230 --> 28:06.472
on. It carried on through us.

28:12.677 --> 28:20.784
And if there's another war, hey, maybe some guys 
will be part of our family, probably doing the same

28:12.677 --> 28:20.784
thing. Because I think all our relatives are our 
family. They feel the same way.

28:30.700 --> 28:31.722
serving the country.

28:35.127 --> 28:39.473
What did you think of the Vietnamese people when 
you were over there?

28:40.595 --> 28:46.143
The Vietnamese, they wanted the G.I. to be there. 
Economically, it was one of them.

28:57.420 --> 28:59.543
They were friendly. And basically what I'm 
talking about is the villagers, the old people. I

29:05.744 --> 29:09.370
never saw the young guys, the young men. They were 
probably in the unfortunate. The contact that we

29:17.382 --> 29:27.117
had was mainly with the papasan, the namasan, the 
kids.

29:29.459 --> 29:59.078
and I you know they treated us like hey you're the 
number one GI you know especially Hispanics that

29:29.459 --> 29:59.078
you know dark-skinned Hispanics they kind of look 
up to us like you're big you're strong and I guess we

29:29.459 --> 29:59.078
were more like a model to them that hey it can happen 
you can win the sport and they believe us they had a

29:29.459 --> 29:59.078
lot of trust so They

30:00.830 --> 30:10.379
had us there, you know, like something good had 
happened to them.

30:14.923 --> 30:25.233
And it bothers me a little bit when we're going back 
to the three-brother store in Vietnam.

30:25.253 --> 30:30.077
You know, it's, you know, being a parent now, I just 
wonder how my parents felt having three sons back

30:30.698 --> 30:38.825
to back. It's a worried aspect. And then you wonder 
about the people that protest the war. They saw

30:50.556 --> 30:58.663
that little people that had relatives brothers, 
sisters, whatever some girls say. In my mind, they

31:03.440 --> 31:11.367
never had a doubt in their mind about the family, 
what they were going through. And so it's putting

31:11.387 --> 31:14.790
the GI down. And maybe we learn a lesson today. If 
we're going to get involved in another conflict,

31:20.475 --> 31:27.942
maybe to me, If people want to protest, then they 
don't belong in this country. That's what I feel.

31:34.481 --> 31:37.725
Because they like the American style of living. 
Hey, you shouldn't have no questions on my mind.

31:42.652 --> 31:51.964
Hey, why should you go against things that we're 
trying to accomplish in other places? But hey,

31:52.625 --> 31:54.227
man, it can happen here. I guarantee you that. I 
guarantee you that. And when you see, you know,

32:00.338 --> 32:17.576
people like in Vietnam that were killed and all 
this other stuff that happened, rape for one

32:00.338 --> 32:17.576
thing, then you wonder. You wonder about it. And I 
guess what makes a complete different person, the

32:20.159 --> 32:28.928
GI they have served, But we know from firsthand, 
because we were there and we saw it. And we can feel

32:34.564 --> 32:39.251
it, what can happen overnight. I could see it right 
now. I could see somebody out there behind my

32:41.434 --> 32:51.268
backyard.

32:51.288 --> 32:52.029
And it bothers me. It really bothers me. Sometimes 
I go out there, sightseeing, behind our backyard,

32:58.557 --> 33:08.531
and I go behind our backyard to Rio Grande do Rio 
right there, Rio. And I just, you know, in my mind I

33:09.953 --> 33:14.119
could just see people coming across. 
Infiltration. And that's how it starts. And

33:20.328 --> 33:25.155
people that come, they call this all this riot and 
stuff, you know, it's all communists. And they're

33:26.013 --> 33:28.536
not going to get through military faces. They're 
going to go through education

33:28.576 --> 33:35.683
or other aspects of communist tactics. And I think 
that's one of the ways they penetrate the society

33:37.384 --> 33:53.060
of the American people, by getting all this 
information into the public, whether it's the

33:37.384 --> 33:53.060
media or TV media or whatever. Here, Reagan is 
asking for $100 million. Hey, my point of view,

33:56.540 --> 34:02.830
hey, give him the $100 million. Hey, it's money. 
When you start putting lives out there and you

34:04.793 --> 34:10.922
start losing lives, now how much is $100 million 
going to cover one? Hey, money, that becomes a

34:11.723 --> 34:14.247
very, it's a little thing. You know, it's becoming

34:14.648 --> 34:24.103
a, you know, if the guy wants $100 million, give it 
to him. Give him that. When you start putting

34:25.801 --> 34:29.765
military personnel, people are going to get hurt.

34:32.687 --> 34:35.530
And I can see it right now. And it's not going to be 
100 or 200 casualties. It was back, but Vietnam

34:39.593 --> 34:42.956
had, you know, right there. So here we, you know, I 
think the GI, the guy that was really involved in

34:45.659 --> 34:55.808
the military, they can tell you right now, When it 
comes to money, you can't buy lots of money.
