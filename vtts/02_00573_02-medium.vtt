WEBVTT

00:01.111 --> 00:13.686
to the American consulate, you know, the 
Hungarian, actually the American consulate in

00:01.111 --> 00:13.686
Vienna who was taking care of the Hungarian 
refugees and then We got our visas, we got our

00:14.240 --> 00:17.244
papers. They interrogated my father and asked him 
if he's a communist or not, or if he ever was a

00:17.585 --> 00:26.758
communist, which he was a communist because he had 
two children. If he wasn't a communist, he wasn't

00:26.798 --> 00:38.695
communist at heart, you know, but he had to say he 
was, otherwise he would never get the kind of

00:26.798 --> 00:38.695
treatment that we got, you know. But anyhow, he 
convinced the people over there that he wasn't a

00:38.843 --> 00:43.912
communist and everything. So we got sent to 
Salzburg from there on a train. And then from

00:49.222 --> 00:58.860
Salzburg, we took an electric train all the way 
across Austria through Germany to Bremenhaven.

00:59.448 --> 01:08.299
Bremen Harbor, it's a big port next to Hamburg, a 
big seaport, you know. And on the 19th of January,

01:08.319 --> 01:15.508
we took aboard on a military ship. About 2,000 of us 
were put on that ship, and then we came, sailed

01:15.528 --> 01:21.476
across the United States. And it took us 11 days, 11 
days to get over here. What were the feelings on the

01:26.903 --> 01:28.568
ship? On the ship, it was wonderful. Everybody got 
seasick, though, but, you know, the feeling of the

01:30.775 --> 01:38.500
freedom and, you know, When you get to the New York 
Harbor and then you sailed across the Statue of

01:38.783 --> 01:49.700
Liberty, I mean, you know, my mother was crying and 
then it was really, really cold. And I remember the

01:49.740 --> 01:59.475
ship was coming in, you know, and then we see this 
faint light and then we got closer and you saw it was

01:49.740 --> 01:59.475
the Statue of Liberty, you know. It was, the 
feeling was, you know, just like a rebirth, you

02:00.029 --> 02:07.258
know, a renaissance of a new life, you know. My 
father and my mother was planning. And there's a

02:11.183 --> 02:21.437
lot of uncertainties also because you didn't know 
what you were getting into, you know, and you had

02:11.183 --> 02:21.437
two young children, you know, that needed taking 
care of and everything. So, but they had a lot of

02:21.457 --> 02:29.327
ambition, you know, and they were healthy and they 
knew they could make it in a new world. And once we

02:30.202 --> 02:37.744
got to the harbor, we were here for two days. They 
wouldn't let us out of the boat until we went

02:37.784 --> 02:43.401
through another total... examination, medical 
examination, you know. And then we were sent to a

02:47.594 --> 02:52.263
military post. We went to Camp Kilmer in New 
Jersey. They took us on. Everybody was put on big

02:56.691 --> 03:02.361
buses, about 15, 20 buses, and we all went over 
there. And we got a new set of clothing over there.

03:06.268 --> 03:08.292
We were there for about a week, you know. and a new 
set of clothing from top to bottom, you know, just

03:08.693 --> 03:13.481
everything. And a religious group from Salem, New 
Jersey had approached the camp and they were

03:14.442 --> 03:30.988
looking for three Hungarian families that they 
promised work and housing for. And we happened to

03:31.475 --> 03:38.690
be one of the three families and we settled in 
Phelan, New Jersey in the beginning. This was from

03:39.632 --> 03:44.843
February of 1957 until August of 69, you know, is 
when we moved from New Jersey to Texas, you know,

03:46.038 --> 03:56.011
but during those years, you know, I went through 
high school. I married a Hungarian woman whom I met

03:56.491 --> 04:10.469
in a Hungarian church, you know, and in that part of 
the United States, like in New Jersey, there's a

03:56.491 --> 04:10.469
lot of ethnic groups. Everybody was coming across 
the Atlantic Ocean from Europe. There were a lot of

04:15.502 --> 04:36.504
lot of German people, a lot of Hungarian people, a 
lot of Russians, you know, a lot of Polish people,

04:15.502 --> 04:36.504
and they were all had their own little towns in New 
York City, you know, and we lived only about 10-15

04:15.502 --> 04:36.504
miles from the New York City, and we all went to take 
get picnics over there. They had Hungarian

04:36.524 --> 04:40.328
schools, Hungarian churches, so we fit in pretty 
easy over there and the transition was a little bit

04:40.696 --> 04:48.796
easier going through this way. In the beginning 
when you first came to the United States did you

04:49.518 --> 04:52.866
still hear keep up of course you did but did you hear 
all what was going on in Hungary still yes we we did

04:53.588 --> 05:20.254
in the beginning we exchanged a lot of letters but 
the letters got censored and we got the word from

04:53.588 --> 05:20.254
our relatives that we should not write or we should 
break contacts because they made the lives of our

04:53.588 --> 05:20.254
loved ones over there a lot harder because because 
of our association their association with us so

05:20.943 --> 05:39.205
slowly but surely you know we stopped writing 
letters and uh it was uh it was a sad situation but

05:20.943 --> 05:39.205
they they heard us anywhere they could you know so 
this was one of the ways they did The early ways of

05:39.185 --> 05:44.894
fitting into the new society and the new life was 
kind of hard. It wasn't really hard for me. It was

05:46.758 --> 05:49.162
harder for my mother and my father, you know. I 
picked up the language real fast. I remember I went

05:52.006 --> 05:57.295
to the first grade and In that spring of 57, I 
started the first grade for a couple of weeks. I

06:02.921 --> 06:05.003
learned how to read and write. I remember 
correcting the math papers for the little kids.

06:09.107 --> 06:16.374
And then I went from the first, second, third, 
fourth, fifth, all the way through until sixth or

06:09.107 --> 06:16.374
seventh by the end of June. I was a beginning 10th 
grader when I left Hungary, and I picked up 10th

06:25.726 --> 06:49.827
grade all over again so I really I lost one year 
along the way but I had a lot of credit they gave me a

06:25.726 --> 06:49.827
lot of credit for for foreign language I I had six 
years of Russian behind me when I was a 10th grader I

06:25.726 --> 06:49.827
started Russian they made a start real early you 
know they didn't they didn't learn too much but

06:25.726 --> 06:49.827
they learned taught us a lot of songs in Russian and 
learn we learn how to how to count and things like

06:50.617 --> 07:14.987
that just just words you know we had to do so it my 
father started as a painter you know they gave

06:50.617 --> 07:14.987
first they they put him into a a machine shop and he 
couldn't cope with the the change over from

07:15.642 --> 07:39.743
decimal system to the to the inches was very very 
hard for him he could not he could he couldn't

07:15.642 --> 07:39.743
transfer the system over you know so this this 
Dutch painter this guy came from Holland and he was

07:15.642 --> 07:39.743
started to he asked my father if he would go and help 
him paint you know so I remember my father got a

07:39.976 --> 07:47.245
dollar and a quarter for an hour to paint with him, 
and then he became a painter from that point on. He

07:47.605 --> 07:57.097
got real good at it, and thus the Nagy and Son, we had 
a Nagy and Son painting and decorating over there.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.198
I was still young. I only helped him on the weekends 
because I was still in school, but I used to go with

07:58.238 --> 08:05.207
him and give estimates. you know, on jobs, and I was 
driving the truck. I already got my license when I

08:08.612 --> 08:12.953
was, I turned 16. at June 5th 1957 and I got a license 
and I helped my father get a license also you know

08:14.350 --> 08:39.514
and so he was able to drive fairly soon and 
re-established our painting business and it

08:14.350 --> 08:39.514
flourished and it was pretty good and I got married 
in 1964 and in 1969 we left New Jersey because we

08:40.355 --> 08:59.011
felt that to raise a family, the state was very 
crowded and the place where we lived was a very

08:40.355 --> 08:59.011
crowded city. There was, you know, just, you know, 
Was the United States like you had, did it turn out

09:02.680 --> 09:08.813
to be like you had expected, or from what you had 
heard? Well, it turned out much, much more than

09:08.853 --> 09:12.742
what I expected. I have never, I didn't expect 
anything, what I've got, what I've, you know, I...

09:18.374 --> 09:29.593
I didn't expect paved roads and tall skyscrapers 
and the quality of life and all that was just a shock

09:18.374 --> 09:29.593
to us. The department stores and the supermarkets 
just blew my mind because over there you had to

09:30.014 --> 09:41.513
stand in line for five pounds of frozen potato, you 
know, and then They measured out the flour into a

09:41.729 --> 09:53.707
little paper sack that you had to take with you 
because the grocer didn't have the paper sacks to

09:41.729 --> 09:53.707
put the stuff in, you know. And they had these 
little carrying bags and then they would dump the

09:54.207 --> 10:02.860
tomatoes or the potatoes or the rice or what have 
you right in your bag, you know. And over here you go

10:03.515 --> 10:14.469
in there and everything is pre-packed and nobody, 
you just take it from the shelf and go through to the

10:03.515 --> 10:14.469
cashier and pay for it and be gone, you know. And 
that was just very, you know, the abundance of

10:14.550 --> 10:24.122
articles and the clothing, the shoes. My father 
had to work an hour for one egg. You had to work for a

10:31.072 --> 10:34.296
whole week for a pair of shoes, you know. I mean, 
this is the type, I mean, I had to, I worked a whole

10:35.217 --> 10:59.408
summer long, you know, in between school, summer 
vacations, I used to go work for the railroad,

10:35.217 --> 10:59.408
empty car, empty, unload railroad cars, coals and 
sand, and sometimes the residue from the factory,

10:35.217 --> 10:59.408
you know, when they, when they, When the coal 
burns, there's a lot of ashes and they put these

10:59.388 --> 11:14.822
ashes on the cars and then they carry them out in the 
suburbs of the cities and then you dump them over

10:59.388 --> 11:14.822
there and they spread it out over there between the 
railroad tracks and stuff. I did that all summer

11:14.842 --> 11:16.806
long. And I was able to buy a suit of clothing, you 
know, a pair of pants and a shirt and a pair of shoes,

11:16.786 --> 11:25.421
you know. But these little things helped a great 
deal because my parents weren't able to, you know,

11:25.922 --> 11:36.600
afford too much, you know, just the bare 
necessities and all these things over here. When I

11:37.188 --> 11:42.617
first came to this country, I got a dictionary, and 
I said, I'm going to go get a job. And I was 17 years

11:42.697 --> 11:44.580
old. And I went up and down the street with a 
dictionary in my hand. And I went into every store.

11:50.089 --> 11:51.652
I was 16 years old. I didn't even speak any English. 
And I got hired in a Hebrew national. There's a lot

11:56.326 --> 11:58.349
of Jewish people on the East Coast. And I was 
working in a delicatessen as a kitchen boy. I

12:04.257 --> 12:07.621
wasn't allowed to go into the store. I was in the 
back over there cleaning out the shelves and

12:07.641 --> 12:14.751
sweeping up and just general tidying. And I got 
$0.70 an hour. for doing that, and I thought that

12:20.118 --> 12:23.522
was just great, you know. I made more money in one 
week than my father done in a month. Yeah, it was

12:28.647 --> 12:30.209
great. So, yeah, that was my first one. And then I 
also was a paper boy, and later on when I advanced a

12:31.710 --> 12:47.847
little bit in my speech, I worked for

12:31.710 --> 12:47.847
a furniture store as a delivery boy, you know, and, 
you know, I went through hard times. After high

12:49.862 --> 12:55.475
school, I attended the University of Fairleigh 
Dickinson for a couple of years. I attended some

12:56.196 --> 13:07.101
courses in Rutgers for a semester and a half, and I 
never finished college altogether. was going to

13:07.655 --> 13:09.097
finish it. I finished a trade school called RETS. 
It's a radio, electronic, and tech television

13:13.662 --> 13:17.887
school, you know. So I'm a full-fledged,

13:17.907 --> 13:29.340
you might call it a mechanical engineer, sort of, 
you know. But never finished college. And when I

13:33.145 --> 13:35.788
was... I got married in 1964, and we lived four more 
years, and then we decided to come to Texas in 1969.

13:46.407 --> 13:59.582
And ever since, you know, I used to live on Hillview

13:46.407 --> 13:59.582
Drive for 17 or 18 years, and then we sold that house 
over here. I'm just kind of continuing what I

13:59.782 --> 14:02.886
started. You know, I was a painter, I'm still a 
painter, but I do some remodeling now. And I have

14:07.873 --> 14:11.738
four children, and we're making it. Quite well. 
Looking back on it, what do you feel are some of the

14:14.141 --> 14:20.409
most significant outcomes of the Revolution of 
1946? Well, the most significant outcome of the

14:20.429 --> 14:28.540
Revolution, in my mind, was that... We tried it for 
a while and it worked for two weeks, you see. And

14:35.002 --> 14:43.673
that put a very big

14:35.002 --> 14:43.673
dream in a people's mind, you know. And as we can see 
it, that, you know, ever since then there were

14:44.734 --> 14:54.426
really little revolutions throughout the areas, 
you know. Czechoslovakia had another one in the

14:55.064 --> 15:14.220
early 60s and Poland never really gotten really 
settled Poland was always one that was always

14:55.064 --> 15:14.220
dissatisfied and finally I think the whole 
disillusionment and everything just came to a

15:14.555 --> 15:21.001
such an abrupt end in this last year, you know, that 
communism just totally got wiped out. I really

15:21.882 --> 15:24.165
like to go back and visit. Up to now, I was not able to 
go back because I'm wearing my father's name, you

15:24.525 --> 15:39.820
know, I'm junior, and he was really sought after 
after the revolution. And later on, in the early

15:40.171 --> 15:49.647
days, my relatives wrote that my father would have 
gotten deported to Siberia had he come back.

15:52.232 --> 15:52.973
Excuse me. I don't know. Amnesty rules didn't make 
any difference over there. But I'd like to go back

15:59.304 --> 16:04.693
now and visit where I grew up and where I went to 
school. see if I can locate some of my relatives

16:04.927 --> 16:33.330
most of my father's brothers and sisters he had 
three brothers and a sister they're all died you

16:04.927 --> 16:33.330
know so did my father he died 1974 you know over here 
in Texas but I think it wasn't in vain I don't think

16:04.927 --> 16:33.330
it was in vain because you know it it it Everybody 
finally got freedom because of some of the

16:34.154 --> 16:40.177
peoples, you know. So what were your feelings when 
you saw the wall come down? Oh, boy, I would have

16:43.030 --> 16:50.120
loved to be there, you know, because we didn't 
climb that wall because we didn't come through

16:43.030 --> 16:50.120
there. But the wall to me was coming across the Iron 
Curtain, you know, and it was up there. And it was

16:56.730 --> 16:59.975
down for two weeks, but after that it was up, you 
know. And I was really thrilled when all these

17:00.175 --> 17:05.262
things were happening, you know. I said, my God, if 
my father would have... would be alive now. It was

17:08.556 --> 17:12.421
just great. I really am thankful for this country. 
I would go to war for this country, you know, and I

17:14.984 --> 17:27.298
would, you know, raise arms and I would defend this 
country because I think, you know, there's a lot of

17:14.984 --> 17:27.298
good, you know, is here, you know. Freedom is what 
people want, you know, and it's a very big thing to

17:27.778 --> 17:34.806
be cherished. Well thank you very much for this 
interview, Mr. Nagy. You're welcome.
