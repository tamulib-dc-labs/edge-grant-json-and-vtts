WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:16.973
We had

00:01.853 --> 00:16.973
specific rules of engagement in which we were, 
let's say, restricted against certain types of

00:01.853 --> 00:16.973
targets and against certain types of tactics 
fighting. You probably don't know that a fighter

00:17.734 --> 00:31.573
pilot flying over North Vietnam in war could not 
shoot down a North Vietnamese transport airplane

00:17.734 --> 00:31.573
that had North Vietnamese markings on it. He was 
told categorically, you cannot shoot that

00:31.975 --> 00:37.302
airplane down. We couldn't hit certain targets. 
Get back to my subject. Really, really, actually,

00:41.067 --> 00:54.324
we, the rules of engagement, read them 
specifically, you could not attack and fire at a

00:41.067 --> 00:54.324
North Vietnamese fighter unless it threatened 
you. Now, that's the fact. Are you kidding? That's

00:55.685 --> 00:56.607
the fact. That a fighter? That a fighter. Jeez. 
That must have done wonders. Really, really,

01:03.081 --> 01:07.106
really, we ignored this. And, of course, you could 
see a fighter over there. He was attacked. How

01:11.051 --> 01:13.374
could anybody prove that he wasn't a threat to you? 
Of course, you couldn't enforce that. But the

01:15.858 --> 01:18.922
transport, you may have been diplomats in it. Who 
knows? Getting back to the dam, you couldn't bust

01:20.904 --> 01:24.349
these dams. That would turn the water loose in 
North Vietnam and destroy the countryside. We

01:27.593 --> 01:28.414
didn't want to do that. I'm saying it's very 
sarcastic. But the power, the powerhouse at that

01:31.190 --> 01:38.858
dam, it produced electricity. We all tried to hit 
that. But being about knowing how hydroelectric

01:40.560 --> 01:55.215
plants are with respect to dam, right adjacent to 
the dam, particularly the influx of water going

01:40.560 --> 01:55.215
down the chute, maybe 10 feet from the dam on the 
water side. But how are you going to drop a lot of

01:55.876 --> 01:59.239
bombs and hit that without hitting the dam? But we 
couldn't do that until we got the laser-guided

02:00.046 --> 02:03.029
bombs. And I've actually seen pictures brought 
back where a laser-guided bomb was dropped two or

02:03.049 --> 02:20.386
three up and hit right in the funnel, 10-foot 
diameter funnel, of this hydroelectric plant and

02:03.049 --> 02:20.386
never even touched the dam. That's how hateful it 
was. I've seen bombs go through the roof of

02:23.209 --> 02:28.334
powerhouses right in the middle of Hanoi. We've 
got pictures of it. That was

02:30.742 --> 02:42.332
produced with Texas Instruments, and I'm proud to 
say that I was instrumental in getting that into

02:30.742 --> 02:42.332
the Air Force. And when did we get the laser bomb? 
Just about the time I left. You mean in the

02:46.655 --> 02:47.696
Porsches? Yeah. Just about the time I came home in 
1967. So

02:50.158 --> 03:00.327
that was a great improvement.

03:03.023 --> 03:06.446
Well, we've raised a lot of questions about this. 
We were talking about problems. We were talking

03:08.308 --> 03:13.833
about morale, and we were talking about some of the 
problems, and morale seems to be a major problem.

03:13.853 --> 03:15.334
Well, it wasn't a real major problem. It was one of 
the problems. It was one of the problems, and how

03:16.255 --> 03:20.719
did you attempt to solve that problem? It seems 
like it's a dilemma. Improve our tactics and

03:22.380 --> 03:27.805
issues, and we did, and we cut down lost colonies at 
one time. One of the...

03:32.639 --> 03:45.855
It's ironic to say it, but one of the best ways we 
improved the morale of the boys over there was

03:32.639 --> 03:45.855
toward the end of the war when we finally got 
instructions above to bring the B-52s in and

03:32.639 --> 03:45.855
really bomb the place. And you recall we did that. 
And, you know, we lost one or two B-52s, sure. But in

03:53.364 --> 04:01.093
that massive, up-to-date, drowned environment 
of modern SAM missiles, we sent formation of the

04:02.204 --> 04:06.390
B-52s over and lost practically none. A few, yeah. 
But look at the effect of that bombing. Had we done

04:10.115 --> 04:17.385
this initially in the war, that war wouldn't have 
lasted six months. Now why would a carpet bombing

04:17.405 --> 04:26.338
of the B-52 versus your bombing from your fighters

04:27.432 --> 04:35.580
Why do you say that that was more effective, and why 
couldn't they, why couldn't the SAM missiles hit

04:27.432 --> 04:35.580
those 52s like they could hit you? Well, first, 
let's be sure we understand when you say carpet

04:36.081 --> 04:40.225
bombing. When I say carpet bombing, I'm talking 
about the use of the B-52s against Viet Cong in

04:40.245 --> 04:45.811
South Vietnam. Right, in the Ho Chi Minh Trail. 
Yeah, and this was... Well, let's talk about...

04:47.473 --> 04:54.520
Now, the pinpoint bombing against targets by the 
B-52s And North Vietnam was the same as the

04:55.006 --> 05:00.716
pinpoint bombing of the fighters, except, you 
know- Was it laser too? No, not B-52. It was just

05:03.281 --> 05:11.516
plain old B-52 bomb system bombing by radar or 
actual visual bombing. Normal capability of B-52

05:11.536 --> 05:16.304
as it is today to bomb. They don't have the 
capability of laser bombs on a B-52? Is it out of

05:20.082 --> 05:21.344
range or what? No. Matter of fact, while I was at TI, 
I brought this up, and I'm proud of the fact that we

05:21.704 --> 05:31.097
built a system to make a B-52 a smart bomber. A smart 
bomber, in other words, a laser-guided bomb, and

05:31.197 --> 05:36.224
built equipment to put a B-52 to do the same thing. 
It's just a matter of putting a laser on one of the

05:36.525 --> 05:48.401
aircraft so that he can mark the target with the 
same B-52, if you will, or another B-52 dropping

05:36.525 --> 05:48.401
laser-guided bomb. The laser-guided bomb has to 
be It was a special-equipped bomb with a laser

05:50.120 --> 05:52.784
homer on it. Yeah, right. Only built at TM. Okay, so 
we had it on the fighters, but we didn't have it on

05:55.187 --> 05:58.572
the B-52s. No, that's right. Okay. Now, why did we 
lose so many fighters over North Vietnam versus

06:00.595 --> 06:07.626
why did we not lose so many B-52s? Well, why were the 
SAMs more effective against the fighters versus

06:07.686 --> 06:11.952
the B-52s? Well, because of the fact that the 
fighters were the ones that were doing the bombing

06:16.529 --> 06:28.541
when the SAMs were first brought in and had to 
experience and learn and stomach this type of

06:16.529 --> 06:28.541
aerial warfare

06:16.529 --> 06:28.541
initially. We weren't using BPIC-2s at that time. 
We weren't authorized to use them. And through the

06:33.807 --> 06:43.937
experience of the fighters going through this, if 
you will, learning curve of tactics and

06:33.807 --> 06:43.937
techniques, and new technology and evasive 
action. Electronics. We knew all of this before we

06:51.410 --> 06:58.120
ever threw the B-52s in, and we knew how to suppress 
the sounds. That's the reason we didn't use any

06:58.140 --> 06:59.842
B-52s. We used ECM.

07:03.427 --> 07:10.057
And we go back to a famous statement by General 
LeMay, the bomber will always be able to get

07:03.427 --> 07:10.057
through to hit its target. Well, this is true, 
but... Under what conditions and how many losses

07:13.432 --> 07:16.776
are you going to accept? Sure. In other words, and 
correct me if I'm wrong, we would have started out

07:17.637 --> 07:25.626
with the bombings of the B-52s. Instead of 
starting out with the fighters, we would have lost

07:25.747 --> 07:32.655
a lot of B-52s initially in 66 and 67. You bet your 
boots. Because we learned new tactics from the

07:34.557 --> 07:43.067
fighters in 66 and 67 before we threw the B-52s 
around 1970 at them. Okay. Definitely. Okay.

07:46.304 --> 07:46.564
Good. Great. Now, let's get back to morale. Were 
there other ways that we tried to boost the morale

07:51.829 --> 07:57.314
of the pilots? Other ways, like R&R? Oh, man. We 
built some of the finest facilities for the pilots

08:00.637 --> 08:04.541
you could ever imagine. Tell me about it. The staff 
that would come on visits from Washington were

08:05.381 --> 08:12.328
experienced TAC commanders. Matter of fact, 
General Dissway,

08:13.203 --> 08:23.233
commanding, well, General Dissway was very 
experienced in tactical. The Tactical Air Force

08:23.913 --> 08:25.415
was back home. Would come over and see our 
facilities in Thailand for living, where the

08:25.675 --> 08:33.282
pilots lived, barracks. Actually, if you will, 
little cottages almost. The maintenance

08:38.948 --> 08:42.231
facilities for the aircraft, air conditioning. 
Beautiful equipment and all. Top notch stuff. And

08:46.800 --> 08:49.423
top notch, the cream of the crop. Airmen, you know, 
polished it, were sent over there to fight the war,

08:49.443 --> 08:52.887
rightfully so. Gee, I don't even have this at home. 
So it was, and particularly, we even built a golf

08:56.530 --> 09:00.835
course, one of the basics. No kidding. It was a 
modified golf course, but even built one of those.

09:03.758 --> 09:06.260
That's again, Jim Wilson. So really, I'm 
overdoing the morale. It wasn't, it was a problem.

09:10.797 --> 09:15.362
And had we not done a lot of these things, it could 
have gotten worse. I assure you this, we couldn't

09:15.782 --> 09:18.825
afford to keep losing aircraft like that. We had to 
do some. But here again, and I give General Momar

09:19.926 --> 09:37.885
and some of the previous commanders full credit, 
as well as the wing commanders, you know, it's a

09:19.926 --> 09:37.885
matter of staff people, planners, and 
operational people getting together and making

09:19.926 --> 09:37.885
decisions on how we would, you know, revised 
tactics and all.

09:47.717 --> 10:02.235
Any administrative problem with respect to the 
Thai Air Force or any, let's say, political

09:47.717 --> 10:02.235
problems in Thailand, now that is where I really 
came into the act at one of my functions, and

09:47.717 --> 10:02.235
objective and problem. Let's get to that in just a 
minute. I want to talk about the morale as far as

10:04.101 --> 10:07.806
enlisted men for the two years that you were there. 
How was the morale as far as enlisted? Great. We

10:11.791 --> 10:13.333
took care of the enlisted men the same way. And you 
know, as soon as you bring this question up, and

10:14.475 --> 10:28.273
I'll tell you right now, when I was there in 
Thailand in 1966 and 67,

10:14.475 --> 10:28.273
I don't remember I don't remember in my staff 
meetings, my personnel, staff man, ever bringing

10:29.502 --> 10:37.610
up the problem of drugs and marijuana. I don't 
remember this at all. Now, this is in Thailand.

10:42.536 --> 10:46.820
See, we didn't have Viet Cong that might come in and 
cover a base at night. So the morale of our boys, it

10:46.840 --> 10:55.749
was a considerably easier situation living in 
Thailand than it was in South Vietnam at an air

10:46.840 --> 10:55.749
base. Was there any security problems where you 
ever attacked? Never. And the Thai Air Forces, by

11:00.130 --> 11:03.274
the way, was at each base. They were responsible 
for your security. They were responsible for base

11:05.056 --> 11:06.217
defense. Now, we did have a few, much evidence in 
North, around Udorn and Ubon, North and East

11:06.237 --> 11:29.563
Thailand, and particularly Nakhon Phanom, where 
there was evidence of, let's say, Pathet Lao,

11:06.237 --> 11:29.563
Laotian, which would count, you know, tantamount 
to Viet Cong.

11:31.163 --> 11:38.293
making probe attempts to enter the base, but I 
don't recall ever an attack on a base in Thailand.

11:38.774 --> 11:41.197
None like there were in South Vietnam. And there 
was never an American airman or pilot shot at or

11:41.218 --> 11:49.509
shot, killed in Thailand, to your memory? No. Not 
from a standpoint of warfare, no. OK. And no drugs.

11:55.879 --> 11:56.800
That is surprising. As a matter of fact, when I, you 
know, subsequent to being out of service and back

11:56.948 --> 12:06.723
home and seeing, reading what I did, I just don't 
recall any having any problems like that. If they

12:06.864 --> 12:15.057
were, they were never brought to my attention, but 
certainly not on a scale that I have since read

12:06.864 --> 12:15.057
about in South Vietnam. But it's different, and 
you know, the poor old army, the life they lived in

12:15.077 --> 12:23.530
the jungles in South Vietnam, that must have been 
horrible. Now, before we get to the relations that

12:23.729 --> 12:35.066
you had with the Thais on a high level, let's talk 
about the relations that your junior officers and

12:23.729 --> 12:35.066
your enlisted men had with the Thais just going out 
to base on liberty. Oh, no. No problem. No problem.

12:39.012 --> 12:43.619
There was, to answer your question, really no 
problem at that level. No. How long have you been

12:45.142 --> 12:46.564
with that water code? Do you want me to change 
anything? Turn it off. Turn it off. The real

12:54.121 --> 13:05.855
problem was, let's say, the economic effect on the 
country of Thailand that the political levels,

12:54.121 --> 13:05.855
the administrations of Thailand, was confronted 
with. The influx of money. Thais worked in support

13:08.398 --> 13:15.146
roles on the base and then having more money than 
you take a stick at, unusual. They go back home. And

13:17.149 --> 13:24.077
then, naturally, it's developed a black market 
type of an operation with PX supplies and this type

13:17.149 --> 13:24.077
of a thing. And inflation. And inflation, oh yeah. 
And it had an impact, see. The Thai people weren't

13:29.553 --> 13:32.216
used to this type of thing. For instance, we had to 
build barracks and had to build them fast at Udorn.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.224
Well, we just put out a... We didn't have the 
American forces to do that. Use a saw and hammer. So

13:41.127 --> 13:43.409
we put out an advertisement in Udorn. Show up at the 
gate tomorrow morning with a saw and hammer and

13:43.770 --> 13:47.694
we'd hire you as a carpenter. Rice growers that 
couldn't even saw would show up with a brand new saw

13:47.714 --> 13:52.920
and a brand new hammer at the gate. We hired them. In 
48 hours, we trained him as a carpenter, and he did

13:53.977 --> 13:57.862
well. Did they? That type of thing. Did they have 
more hard workers? Oh, yeah. The people of the

14:05.692 --> 14:07.694
street, they loved it. They had no problem 
whatsoever. Of course, you had prostitution, but

14:09.917 --> 14:12.941
you had that throughout the world. That was no 
problem. Venereal disease really was not too

14:15.544 --> 14:18.668
great a problem. The medical problems, by the way, 
were not great. We had no real medical problems.

14:23.818 --> 14:24.339
Clean. Clean. Well, we kept it clean. Yeah. And I 
give General Wolfe a full credit for it. Boy, he was

14:28.664 --> 14:33.711
a monster when it came to uncleanliness. And when 
you hired these people to come in and build your

14:33.952 --> 14:40.180
base, you had American supervisors, of course. 
Oh, yeah. They just nailed away. Oh, yeah. Oh,

14:42.523 --> 14:42.944
yeah. What did you pay them? Did you pay them a lot 
more than they could make? No, no, see that's one of

14:45.752 --> 14:50.720
the things that was coordinated at the political 
level. You couldn't go much above what the going

14:51.101 --> 14:58.834
rate was, otherwise it cost such enough people, 
but still it was more money than they'd ever seen

14:51.101 --> 14:58.834
before. Do you remember about how much it was a day? 
No, no I don't. All I know is it was carefully

15:02.260 --> 15:07.909
figured

15:02.260 --> 15:07.909
and controlled. Okay, so for the two years you were 
in there, it sounds like enlisted morale was high.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.814
Oh, with no real problem. Okay. Now let's talk 
about a headache that you had, or a challenge

15:17.735 --> 15:26.309
anyway, and that is the relations with the Thai 
officials. Well, if I had a problem, in other

15:28.173 --> 15:32.580
words.

15:33.792 --> 15:41.079
I thought you said that you had some problems as far 
as relations with Tide, which was another part of

15:33.792 --> 15:41.079
your duties and functions. The economic problem 
and political problem is one of the things I just

15:41.740 --> 15:46.164
described here. It wasn't an insurmountable and 
great problem, but it was one of the problems that

15:46.264 --> 15:52.771
required my attention. So what about the politics 
of dealing with the king, the queen, and other high

15:53.531 --> 16:02.500
military officials? I had to keep Air Marshal 
Boonshue, the Chief of Staff. How do you spell

16:08.455 --> 16:10.077
that? I'll correct it. It's almost the way it 
sounds. B-O-U-N-C-H-O-U something, G-G

16:17.407 --> 16:22.674
something like that. In a lot of these things, I 
suggest, well, in your history, you probably want

16:22.694 --> 16:27.260
to spell it accurately, and I'll try it. I think in 
my papers I have the exact spelling. You'll find

16:30.584 --> 16:31.525
something. Because that would be impossible for 
my gal to spell these words. Oh, yeah. But I'd keep

16:37.594 --> 16:47.867
him informed of our, if we brought in some 
additional replacements or aircraft, I'd keep

16:37.594 --> 16:47.867
him informed. And a lot of times, by the way I did 
this, I would do it through what we called the

16:47.987 --> 16:57.600
American MAG Forces, Military Assistance Group, 
which was stationed right in Bangkok. And their

16:57.620 --> 16:59.402
primary mission was to support and train the Thai 
Air Forces. And many times, me being up at Udorn,

17:05.510 --> 17:13.723
I'd just get on the phone and call the colonel 
heading up that group and tell him about this

17:05.510 --> 17:13.723
problem. And since he was dealing daily across the 
board with the Thai Air Force staff, he could

17:13.743 --> 17:23.719
really handle this problem easily for me. It was 
only major things where I'd have to take a trip down

17:24.374 --> 17:43.957
to Thailand and maybe even get with the ambassador 
that would require my attention to go across maybe

17:24.374 --> 17:43.957
to the ambassador to talk with somebody at the Thai 
governmental level, like the prime minister,

17:24.374 --> 17:43.957
maybe Air Marshal Da Wee or somebody like that. An 
example maybe, huh? What would it be? Let me see.

17:50.305 --> 17:50.865
Oh, yes. The at the high, of course, international 
diplomatic level, Thailand trying to play their

17:55.103 --> 18:19.457
cards as carefully as possible and not get North 
Vietnamese invading Thailand, they would never

17:55.103 --> 18:19.457
admit openly, publicly, that American aircraft 
were operating on Thai bases. Everybody in the

18:20.129 --> 18:27.000
world knew this, but they could not openly admit 
this to the media, the correspondents. And

18:27.020 --> 18:31.388
correspondents were always trying to get them to 
admit this. And even though correspondents could

18:31.408 --> 18:34.132
see them flying home? Well, correspondents 
weren't, uh, they were controlled pretty well

18:34.152 --> 18:43.167
through, uh, throughout bases of Thailand, they 
were pretty well restricted to Bangkok, and you

18:44.024 --> 18:53.937
know, making the inquiries right there in 
Bangkok. I guess I've seen, I guess during my

18:54.578 --> 19:06.353
fifteen months over there, or eighteen months, I 
guess I saw in brief correspondence at my air base

18:54.578 --> 19:06.353
in Udon, maybe twice. And once, when we finally 
agreed, and here again was a careful coordination

19:08.189 --> 19:15.238
with the Thais, it wasn't a problem, but it was 
solving a problem. Money Thailand was going to

19:15.258 --> 19:22.488
announce, I agree, announce publicly that the 
American players were operating from their base.

19:22.508 --> 19:28.656
We had a big, open meeting with the correspondents 
at Tockley, up in Corotta, Tockley, Tockley. And I

19:28.676 --> 19:32.922
got up and, you know, officially announced it. And

19:32.942 --> 19:36.947
the problem went away then. The media, I just want 
to be able to say it. They weren't bugged after

19:40.189 --> 19:42.231
that. Do you call that a problem? Really not. It's 
just something that had to be lived with. Whenever

19:48.057 --> 20:04.471
the king and queen made an official visit 
throughout Thailand, let's say in the upper

19:48.057 --> 20:04.471
reaches of Thailand to the hinterland, 
particularly during the months of the heavy

19:48.057 --> 20:04.471
flooding of the Kong River, they wanted to show up 
to boost the morale of the people. I would provide

20:04.852 --> 20:06.293
helicopters for them. With American or tied 
insignia? American helicopters and American

20:11.463 --> 20:14.386
insignia. No kidding. And they'd fly them out and 
they wouldn't change the insignia? See, we had

20:20.773 --> 20:24.857
some helicopter portraits of our own anyhow, but 
so did the Ties. But a Tied King would fly in a

20:24.897 --> 20:28.881
foreign helicopter? Sure, there's no problem 
about that. Well, I mean, he wouldn't even change

20:31.164 --> 20:33.586
the insignia. No, no. I'd say, see, I'd fly him out 
of Udorn, maybe 20, 30 miles north up along the

20:35.534 --> 20:51.415
banks of the Mekong River, still in Thailand, and 
land in the, let's say, in a little island in the

20:35.534 --> 20:51.415
middle of the flooded area where a lot of the people 
have congregated. Then he'd get out and walk among

20:51.435 --> 20:56.301
the people and bow and scrape and show reverence. 
And, oh, this was a great thing. And then he'd get

20:59.425 --> 21:02.389
back in the airplane and bring it back to Udorn. 
There was never even talk about insignia on the

21:02.429 --> 21:04.512
airport. The people were just happy to see their 
royalty. That's right. In Thailand, number one is

21:10.483 --> 21:13.907
religion. Number two is the king and queen. Number 
three is, well, what else?

21:20.977 --> 21:22.779
The king and queen are very important. You know, 
you realize a lot of coups in Thailand, but the king

21:22.799 --> 21:28.527
and queen are always there. And Thailand is always 
there. But it's the lower structure that has

21:30.931 --> 21:34.195
changed. and most of the time it's pretty well 
infused with military people. Surprisingly,

21:43.117 --> 21:48.824
Thailand has survived through the Japanese 
invasion. It's still intact and so forth. Okay, so

21:50.827 --> 21:52.869
back to the relations with the Thais. How about 
just working with the Thailanis? How about just

21:57.996 --> 21:59.878
working with the people? The military people? 
Yeah. How were relations between American

22:02.618 --> 22:05.481
generals and Thai generals? Excellent. 
Excellent. Matter of fact, we have a healthy

22:07.063 --> 22:11.829
respect for one another, and I was proud of this.

22:16.114 --> 22:18.897
The comments about the capabilities is another 
thing. Let's talk about that later on, the

22:18.957 --> 22:21.199
military capabilities. But our relations with 
them was terrific. Their morale was great. we

22:27.972 --> 22:30.135
really had a healthy respect for one another. I 
think in a lot of cases the Thai Air Force officers

22:30.155 --> 22:42.211
were delighted that this vast American bomber 
machine was operating their bases. Look at the

22:42.272 --> 22:44.755
experience they were getting just watching this. 
Look at the experience they were getting. One of

22:47.859 --> 22:52.866
the, wasn't really a problem, but it was something 
I had to carefully monitor and be very careful

22:53.150 --> 22:59.457
about was the so-called air defense of Thailand. 
See here where the American forces on these bases

23:00.438 --> 23:14.233
in Thailand and

23:00.438 --> 23:14.233
for all practical purposes the Thais didn't have 
any air defense. They had a few F-86s

23:14.253 --> 23:22.161
which were really air defense type aircraft but 
very few But here we had all these F-4s and F-105s.

23:27.410 --> 23:39.122
And let's say that the North Vietnamese suddenly 
maybe wanted to attack in our base in Thailand. Who

23:39.202 --> 23:40.624
would defend against this? Well, the Thais knew we 
had a better capability. As a matter of fact, we

23:45.008 --> 23:47.811
were operating with key radars. for, you know, 
controlling the oil. No kidding? You were

23:50.360 --> 23:51.962
operating their radars? No. You were operating 
the key radars on the base? The key radar sites.

23:56.047 --> 23:57.008
Yeah, on the bases. On the bases, but eventually we 
turned them over to the Thais and the Thais were

23:57.549 --> 24:02.595
operating them. Because really we didn't fear an 
air defense tactical situation in Thailand. to a

24:09.678 --> 24:14.124
great extent, didn't fear an air defense tactical 
situation in South Vietnam. It was a matter of, you

24:15.045 --> 24:19.891
know, the North Vietnamese forces had an air 
defense force. But there were some helicopter

24:19.911 --> 24:34.730
operations every once in a while across the river 
from Laos into Thailand, and we'd pick them up on a

24:19.911 --> 24:34.730
radar, and naturally we had to scramble something 
to intercept them. Most of this was at night. I

24:36.332 --> 24:39.516
think, looking back now, that a lot of this was 
plain smuggling. by

24:40.542 --> 25:01.071
who knows, whether it was the Pathet Lao, or Viet 
Cong, or North Vietnamese, or maybe even Thais

24:40.542 --> 25:01.071
smuggling gold, or marijuana, or what have you, 
dope across from Laos to Thailand. But I remember

25:01.712 --> 25:09.503
talking to Marshal Boonshue to coordinate and get 
it understood that and actually on paper and meet

25:10.225 --> 25:19.616
General, get General Momar's approval of my 
responsibilities in Thailand for air defense.

25:20.096 --> 25:38.717
Now, I reported to General Momar tactically, so I 
had to be responsible for air defense of our

25:20.096 --> 25:38.717
American forces in Thailand at these Thai air 
bases, and that's the reason I had a control center

25:20.096 --> 25:38.717
in my headquarters, an air defense control 
center, really a tactical air control center.

25:38.737 --> 25:39.658
What was the plan? The North, let's say the North 
Vietnamese sent over a few MiGs to hit out one of

25:39.875 --> 25:46.123
your air bases. What was the plan? Who would 
scramble? The Americans or the Thais or both? No, I

25:49.267 --> 25:49.648
would. How did it work? I would. I'd scramble. This 
is one of the things that I resolved with Air

25:51.811 --> 25:54.975
Marshal Boonshue. He gave, Air Marshal Boonshue 
actually gave me authority. And orally, he told me

25:59.661 --> 26:05.769
one time, you have authority to shoot these 
aircraft down if you want to. And I asked him to give

26:08.596 --> 26:12.605
me this in writing, and he wouldn't do it. But if it 
came to that problem, I don't think I was worried

26:12.625 --> 26:17.535
about any such thing as that. As a matter of fact, on 
two occasions, on two occasions, we picked up a

26:17.615 --> 26:29.220
blip on our radar right there at Udorn in the 
northern ridges of Thailand, and I had no, see we

26:17.615 --> 26:29.220
got We knew air traffic. We'd given this from 
Seventh Air Force. We knew if there was going to be

26:33.766 --> 26:36.010
any tactical airplanes in the area. Matter of 
fact, we would drive the room where the bombers

26:36.230 --> 26:39.755
right over were going on the way up. We picked up 
this, I was called out of bed about 2 o'clock in the

26:40.576 --> 26:47.367
morning and rushed down to the control center and 
getting in. Actually, I went over to the radar

26:47.587 --> 26:53.436
site, which is right on the same bay, and saw the 
blip. And I got in my control center and I let some of

26:54.158 --> 26:59.986
the Air Force know immediately, personally, is 
there anything there? No, sir, we don't have

27:00.046 --> 27:01.348
anything. Well, that blip went right straight 
over the top of Udorn. Of course, we were attacked.

27:05.994 --> 27:08.878
Went right on down, disappeared to the south. And 
on over south. So you didn't scramble? No. Well, we

27:13.924 --> 27:15.246
scrambled. No, we didn't scramble. Why not? We 
didn't have any fighters right at Udorn. But I was

27:19.927 --> 27:24.412
prepared to tell Korat and Takli to travel to that 
floor if necessary. Now later on, we did get- And

27:24.932 --> 27:28.617
you never found out what this month was? No, but I'm 
convinced what it was. It could have been a high

27:31.199 --> 27:39.348
altitude SR-71 or U-2 on reconnaissance that we 
didn't even know about. Maybe even Seventh Air

27:40.490 --> 27:44.754
Force didn't even know about it. I don't know. It 
was way out there though.

27:49.610 --> 27:50.651
But later on, you said. But later on, we got a little 
bit concerned about such situations. So we

27:55.918 --> 28:05.048
actually had two F-102s stationed at Udorn on air 
defense alert, strictly an air defense

27:55.918 --> 28:05.048
operation. And this element came out of a F-102 
interceptor squadron over at Philippines Clark

28:05.249 --> 28:14.159
Air Force Base. And of course, I monitored their 
operation. To my knowledge, I We may have

28:19.934 --> 28:32.569
scrambled those guys maybe once or twice against a 
suspected attack, either night or day during a

28:19.934 --> 28:32.569
time of the war, maybe once or twice.

28:32.589 --> 28:34.471
Now, what were the TIE capabilities? It sounds 
like we've covered relations with the TIE. It

28:37.034 --> 28:37.855
sounds great. What about the capabilities of 
their Air Force and their military in general? I'd

28:43.120 --> 28:50.369
say the capabilities of the entire Air Force was 
typical of those small countries in the Far East.

28:52.672 --> 28:56.697
Their equipment was, you know, definitely 
obsolete. We finally gave them, just about time I

28:57.018 --> 29:08.192
left, we programmed two or three F-5, modern 
fighter, if you will, two or three. Now they had

29:08.212 --> 29:12.317
three or four squadrons of jet aircraft, F-86 
type. By that time, it was obsolete. And some

29:18.635 --> 29:24.023
little T-26s, which was nothing more but a 
prop-driven trainer airplane. But their mission

29:24.043 --> 29:36.722
really was, I mean, the equipment in our MAG, 
Military Assistance Group, function, which was

29:24.043 --> 29:36.722
done in Thailand, I mean, Bangkok, which wasn't 
under me. It went straight to, you know, back to the

29:36.762 --> 29:42.270
USF headquarters, but coordinated with me. Their 
mission, of course, was to train and equip the Thai

29:42.487 --> 29:49.456
Air Force in accordance with really what their 
threat was. Well, really the only threat at that

29:49.676 --> 30:12.004
time in Thailand was insurrection, possibly 
spilling of the Pathit Lao bit-kong, if you will,

29:49.676 --> 30:12.004
Lao's type bit-kong, Pathit Lao, the bad guy, if 
you will, spilling across the river and causing

29:49.676 --> 30:12.004
trouble in Thailand. Thailand amongst the 
natives, and maybe even sabotaging roads, and

30:12.659 --> 30:20.787
particularly against the Thai police. The Thai 
police were greatly involved in security

30:21.348 --> 30:25.932
throughout Thailand. It was always a matter of 
whether the Thai army was going to do it, whether

30:25.952 --> 30:30.817
the Thai police was going to do it. And actually, we 
equipped the Thai police, you might call them

30:30.837 --> 30:38.785
national police, with helicopters. But they 
didn't have any problems as far as that when you

30:39.153 --> 30:45.140
were there, as far as insurgency. Oh, yes, sir. As a 
matter of fact, my coordination with the Thais was

30:46.042 --> 31:06.467
primarily at the base level, and that's where the 
Thai base commander and the American base

30:46.042 --> 31:06.467
commander coordinated their relations with one 
another, particularly on any possible security

30:46.042 --> 31:06.467
measures or security threats. Now, the main place 
we had this problem was at my base at Udorn and at

31:09.190 --> 31:26.409
Mekong Phnom, way over by the Mekong River in 
extreme, well around the Mekong River on the

31:09.190 --> 31:26.409
border of Laos and Thailand and northeastern part 
of the country. Actually, there was constant

31:26.550 --> 31:34.118
jungle battles between suspected North 
Vietnamese communists, if you will,

31:34.503 --> 31:42.154
insurrectionists, and the Thai police, the Thai 
army, continually. And there was ambushes and

31:42.295 --> 31:44.979
all. Much like what the South Vietnamese and the 
United States Army was involved in in South

31:44.999 --> 31:52.149
Vietnam. But not definitely, definitely not on 
that scale. There was even some possibility we

31:55.094 --> 32:03.987
wondered about up northern, in extreme northern 
Thailand, of maybe Chinese infiltration. But we

32:04.372 --> 32:09.319
never could prove that.

32:09.479 --> 32:11.442
So you equipped the Thai police with helicopters? 
Yep. The United States Air Force. Sure. One of

32:17.030 --> 32:30.269
Ambassador Graham's primary objectives at the 
time I was over there was to, I think, get around 10

32:17.030 --> 32:30.269
or 15 helicopters for the Thai Air Forces. He 
eventually succeeded, but And this gets into

32:33.278 --> 32:39.205
another interesting area between McNamara. 
We'll get to that. OK. It sounds to me that we've

32:44.591 --> 32:52.681
done a fairly good job on the relations with the 
tithes, morale, your functions and duties. Is

32:53.322 --> 32:58.188
there any other types of duties that you were 
involved with? Yes. One of them ought to be brought

32:58.708 --> 33:02.813
out and can be brought out now.

33:05.020 --> 33:34.116
There were some very specious at that time and 
highly classified operations being carried out

33:05.020 --> 33:34.116
in Laos and as

33:05.020 --> 33:34.116
ironic as it sounds and as unusual as it might sound 
to you and just can't understand it, there was a

33:05.020 --> 33:34.116
so-called Air America outfit on Udorn Air Force 
Base, right in my headquarters. Those people were

33:40.063 --> 33:56.005
really controlled and, if you will, managed and 
directed really by the American Ambassador of

33:40.063 --> 33:56.005
Laos at that time, Ambassador Sullivan. But there 
they were at Udorn Air Force Base in Thailand. How

34:00.692 --> 34:02.955
did I fit into that? Finally, I got through 
Ambassador Sullivan. I actually made trips

34:11.121 --> 34:15.406
across the river to his, to his embassy at times.

34:18.149 --> 34:21.674
And frankly, in a way, there was no charter for me 
there. I just liked General McConnell told me to

34:21.694 --> 34:33.027
use your head, and I developed a very close rapport 
with Ambassador Sullivan, and I liked him I assure

34:33.901 --> 34:41.272
you, I assure you, that he was not like the Seventh 
Air Force. From General Momar right on down. He was

34:42.814 --> 34:43.915
not liked by them? Not liked. As a matter of fact, 
General Momar made a special trip up to my

34:45.417 --> 34:53.970
headquarters and to talk to Ambassador Sullivan. 
At my suggestion, look, you two guys better get

34:54.010 --> 34:56.994
together. I realized what the problem was. But 
Ambassador Sullivan was operating, in effect,

35:02.926 --> 35:06.089
Let's put it out on the table. CIA forces as Air 
America. General Mollmeyer had nothing to do with

35:09.172 --> 35:10.893
this. But General Mollmeyer objected to this. 
Here's one air power commander over there, and I'm

35:14.417 --> 35:20.142
sure that Spike is his nickname. I'm sure he went to 
USAAF headquarters through channels to talk

35:20.703 --> 35:31.633
about this, as well as the Navy problem, 
controlling Navy air, you know, Navy strikes

35:20.703 --> 35:31.633
against North Vietnam to coordinate the air. But 
he never got the first base on me. And I agree with

35:35.025 --> 35:36.687
him wholeheartedly. But there I was on the spot, 
and I had to coordinate all this activity. Well,

35:41.552 --> 35:46.857
they- So you had to coordinate the activity 
between the CIA Air America and your own Air

35:41.552 --> 35:46.857
Forces? I would- You know, as a result of being 
there, and like Gentleman McConnell told me, use

35:47.518 --> 35:58.169
your head, I knew that some way or another I was 
going to have to do this, at least keep General

35:47.518 --> 35:58.169
Mulmire informed. Well, this was impossible. 
Why? Because of the CIA. The ambassador wouldn't

36:03.104 --> 36:09.071
give you any, he wouldn't tell you anything about 
Aram or what their mission was? No, and he didn't

36:09.091 --> 36:11.795
have any responsibility or instructions to do it. 
Oh, I knew about Aram. He finally granted me

36:12.916 --> 36:17.802
authority just by sheer rapport that I developed 
with him. He finally granted me authority to

36:17.822 --> 36:27.034
maintain relations and actually cleared me to sit 
in his control center at Air America where I knew

36:27.436 --> 36:32.543
about the operations of all the helicopters. At 
Udorn. At Udorn, yeah. And I had access to it. It

36:36.028 --> 36:43.319
turned out to be not a real great problem up in the 
area with respect to Air America because there

36:36.028 --> 36:43.319
were nothing more but supply missions. Is that 
what they were doing? Yeah, carrying supplies to

36:44.220 --> 36:56.397
the General Mao and his forces that were fighting 
the North Vietnamese in the path of Laos. really

36:56.680 --> 36:58.823
supply missions, really what they were. By 
helicopter. By helicopter. And a few transport

37:00.565 --> 37:04.049
aircraft, like C-123s. But when we got into the- 
From Udorn. From Udorn. But when we got into the

37:07.854 --> 37:26.417
operations of some of the T-26 type aircraft, 
which had a tactical capability to drop bombs, and

37:07.854 --> 37:26.417
this was a Laotian Air Force, maybe let's say 15 or 
20 T-26s, to coordinate their activities, along

37:26.684 --> 37:30.308
the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. And their objective, 
of course, was the same as our Seventh Air Force,

37:31.849 --> 37:41.759
was to stop supplies down the trail and fight the 
insurrectness in Laos. So we had to help, but the

37:42.319 --> 37:56.033
idea when you get airplanes in the air and they 
begin to show up on your blips and your radar and

37:42.319 --> 37:56.033
your air defense system, you've got to know where 
they are and who they are, or you're going to get in

37:42.319 --> 37:56.033
trouble and shoot your own airplanes down. So this 
is where you had to actually do some coordination,

37:56.283 --> 38:21.396
particularly when we got the special forces, and 
this again, now this was under me and General

37:56.283 --> 38:21.396
Beaumont, our 7th Air Force, a B-26 type airplane, 
an old B-26, which was propeller driven twin

37:56.283 --> 38:21.396
engine and could carry some bombs and some 
helicopters, the big heavy helicopters, the

37:56.283 --> 38:21.396
H-53, special forces assigned over in the 
Konvenom and built up that force really in support

38:21.882 --> 38:37.198
of Ambassador Sullivan's forces and objectives 
and requirements in Laos, but here it's based in

38:21.882 --> 38:37.198
the Konvenom in Tuckland. Well, now this is really 
where it got difficult and sticky between General

38:37.639 --> 38:51.754
Mulmire commanding the Air Forces and in 
Southeast Asia, the Air Commander, and

38:37.639 --> 38:51.754
Ambassador Sullivan, if you will, CIA, or black 
forces, as we called them, operating. And this

38:55.582 --> 39:04.291
required a lot of refereeing and arbitration and 
on-the-spot saving and appealing and so forth.

39:04.311 --> 39:07.093
But these little forces... The Air America? No, 
this was not Air America. This were units on the

39:10.597 --> 39:16.003
United States Air Forces assigned to the 13th Air 
Force, just like the F-105. Now, wait a minute. I'm

39:17.504 --> 39:18.785
a little confused. I can imagine. I can imagine. 
Sullivan had Air American forces under his

39:22.143 --> 39:26.089
control. He had Air America Company. Okay. Yeah. 
Which had their... Which is CIA. Under his

39:31.117 --> 39:34.301
control. And basically, they were flying from 
Udorn, your base, into Laos to support the Royal

39:34.602 --> 39:43.235
Laotian forces. Supply. Drop supplies to them. 
Drop supplies to them. Not combat missions,

39:46.460 --> 39:48.082
though. Not combat. Not combat. Resupply. 
Resupply. Resupply only. Of course, the problem

39:54.564 --> 40:05.001
was, is because the Air Force wanted some control 
over that situation, and Sullivan didn't want to

39:54.564 --> 40:05.001
give up any of that control. And that's where you 
come in. That's right. Okay. Now, and the reason it

40:08.687 --> 40:11.071
was a problem. And then you brought, okay, go 
ahead. And the reason it was a problem is because

40:12.613 --> 40:17.601
CIA, the nature of it, had to be secret. Sure. 
strictly a need to know here I was right on the spot

40:18.488 --> 40:47.770
and finally they let me in on the operation 
although it was very widely known you know seen by

40:18.488 --> 40:47.770
people and knew something going on sure but on the 
other hand General Momar having his mission in

40:18.488 --> 40:47.770
writing having his mission to control all air well 
the resupply thing didn't cause such a problem but

40:18.488 --> 40:47.770
it's when okay now we're getting in a new phase and 
this is when fighter planes were introduced in Air

40:48.087 --> 40:50.169
America. Is that true? Explain. Not Air America. 
Okay, explain this. Now, in the confinam, well,

40:53.953 --> 40:59.098
let me start back again. Now, I said that Air 
America, American civilian pilot, you know, flew

40:59.178 --> 41:07.086
helicopters up. They also resupplied some bombs 
for the T-26s in the Laotian Air Force. Oh, okay. So

41:15.114 --> 41:16.876
they were also flying some bombs up there? For the 
Laotians. As measly as it was, 12 to 15 little T-26s

41:18.361 --> 41:31.134
and maybe 250 pound bombs, they were trying to, you 
know, and we had a mag for Laos also, you know. So

41:31.154 --> 41:38.401
they were trying to give them the capability to 
fight the North Vietnamese and support General

41:31.154 --> 41:38.401
Mao in his jungle warfare. Now, to expand that 
capability, expand that capability, this was

41:38.521 --> 41:48.351
done at a much higher in Southeast Asia, probably 
at presidential level and CIA level,

41:48.905 --> 42:14.055
some T-26s and some B-26s were assigned to this 
special warfare force unit at Mekong Phnom, a base

41:48.905 --> 42:14.055
we built up right on the Mekong River in extreme 
eastern Thailand. These are air force special

42:14.236 --> 42:15.677
forces? Air forces. Special Forces assigned to 
7th Air Force and supported by 13th Air Force. And

42:23.113 --> 42:26.017
manned by United States Air Force people. And 
their function, of course, was to bomb the Ho Chi

42:26.598 --> 42:32.147
Minh Trail. I know for a fact, Ambassador 
Graham... In Laos. Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. Yeah,

42:38.897 --> 42:42.022
well, the Ho Chi Minh Trail was in Laos. I know for a 
fact, Ambassador Graham Martin was instrumental

42:45.588 --> 42:48.172
in getting these horses signed. He wanted them in 
Thailand, and in a way, you might say he was

42:48.212 --> 42:59.730
supporting Ambassador Sullivan, because you 
know, Ambassador Martin also had a CIA man on his

42:48.212 --> 42:59.730
staff. And of course, CIA man on his staff was 
always wanting to have the CIA man on Sullivan's It

43:07.475 --> 43:09.558
gets complicated, I know. But at any rate, we got 
the forces. Well, of course, their mission was to

43:11.360 --> 43:13.542
operate in Laos. Okay, who thinks he's the boss in 
Laos? Ambassador Sullivan. Who thinks he's the

43:18.228 --> 43:21.993
boss for air operations over Laos, part of the 
Southeast Asian Theater? General Mollmeyer.

43:23.435 --> 43:24.175
Both of them are right. Who's the referee? Charlie 
Bond. Who uses his head? Charlie Bond, that

43:30.043 --> 43:33.447
General McConnell director. Who understands 
Charlie Bond's position? General Mollmeyer. 7th

43:38.002 --> 43:47.912
Air Force, General Wilson, 13th Air Force, 
General Stilwell, McTighe, Ambassador Martin,

43:38.002 --> 43:47.912
and Ambassador Sullivan. But who gives a damn 
about his problem? None of them. They're only

43:51.276 --> 43:52.677
interested in theirs. Sure. So, it was, but it was 
interesting. There's never dull moment. Okay,

43:58.523 --> 44:02.187
how did you resolve this problem of of the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail and the fighter pilots, Ho Chi Minh

44:03.314 --> 44:08.783
Trail models. Okay.

44:12.609 --> 44:21.683
Visits to General Momar and discussion with him 
finally got him and Ambassador Sullivan together

44:12.609 --> 44:21.683
and- They actually met face to face? Oh yeah, oh 
yeah. At Udorn? Yeah. And actually one time I got

44:23.866 --> 44:27.652
Spike a visit up to Vientiane. He visited the 
embassy. We're right in Vientiane. Very few

44:31.259 --> 44:33.502
people were permitted to go into Laos. Oh, yeah. 
But it was fine and settled where General

44:35.205 --> 44:45.000
Mollmeyer's headquarters fragged these special 
forces based on the con phenomenon. What do you

44:45.020 --> 44:45.841
mean, fragged them? They gave them operational 
orders as to when to take off and where to drop bombs

44:46.062 --> 44:54.795
or look for the enemy, mostly along the Ho Chi Minh 
Trail. In other words, General Mollmeyer was

44:54.815 --> 44:56.658
satisfied. He was controlling them. General 
Ambassador Sullivan was satisfied. He was having

45:03.481 --> 45:10.929
action done against the, committed against the 
enemy, if you will, the common enemy in Laos. Now,

45:12.891 --> 45:15.113
whenever, there was another problem. In a lot of 
ways. How effective was this against Laos?

45:19.738 --> 45:22.000
Surprisingly, it was very effective. And it was 
because of the particular types of pilots and

45:22.020 --> 45:28.907
people that commanded that particular unit. 
Colonel Jaime Aderholt was absolutely superior

45:29.326 --> 45:41.124
in his duties and functions and capability as a 
special forces commander. He personally

45:41.144 --> 45:43.268
sometimes saw the airplanes. And those boys 
operated night in propeller-driven airplanes

45:43.288 --> 45:50.859
and bombed at night, of course, moonlight night. 
And they were fairly effective. They killed

45:52.802 --> 45:55.947
trucks, to use our expression over there. They 
killed trucks on the ultimate draft. Of course,

45:58.688 --> 46:08.097
one as effective as our gunship operation later 
on, where they're hard looking at the red with

45:58.688 --> 46:08.097
their side-shooting guns.

46:09.638 --> 46:11.340
Okay, so we resolved that problem. Now let's add 
other communication and coordination problems.

46:16.785 --> 46:27.835
Another problem, which was in a lot of ways, 
definitely one way politically was much more

46:16.785 --> 46:27.835
important, was there was only certain targets. 
that we could bomb in Laos. And these targets were

46:33.581 --> 46:39.242
to be specified and picked out and approved by 
Ambassador Sutton.
