WEBVTT

00:05.684 --> 00:10.672
We're presently in the office of Dr. Jack 
Hoblitzel in Ingleside, Texas. The date is the

00:11.653 --> 00:22.851
29th of October, 1982, and we're just going to 
discuss a little bit about his history and his past

00:11.653 --> 00:22.851
and so forth. Let's start out, if you will, Dr. 
Hoblitzel, by giving your full name and your

00:23.732 --> 00:33.868
current address, and then we'll go on there with a 
little history of your life. Current address here

00:34.945 --> 00:38.108
is Ingleside, Texas. It's out in the country, 
Route 1, Box 1122. It's on a Tyner Lane, 1225 Tyner

00:43.293 --> 01:00.970
Lane is the street address, and we're living about 
a mile out of downtown Ingleside, a small town of

00:43.293 --> 01:00.970
about 5,000 people, and we moved over here 19... 
56.

01:04.792 --> 01:13.405
I sold a Windsor Park Animal Hospital to the two Dr. 
Pigott's in 56. Moved over here and been here ever

01:14.606 --> 01:16.569
since. All right, let's go back a little bit. Let's 
go back to your birth. When were you born? I was born

01:22.537 --> 01:30.028
in Greene, Kansas, a little town outside of Clay 
Center. Kansas. Lived there till I was about four

01:32.534 --> 01:35.697
years old, four. Moved to St. Joseph, Missouri.

01:41.244 --> 01:49.313
Went to grade school in St. Joe for a year or two, and 
then we moved to the country about five miles south

01:41.244 --> 01:49.313
of St. Joe, Missouri. Went to a little one-room 
schoolhouse where all eight grades were taught in

01:50.214 --> 02:00.285
one room called Stony Point School. had as many as 
two or three eighth graders. They'd teach every

02:06.228 --> 02:17.703
other grade, the seventh and eighth one, eighth 
one year, seventh and next, and sixth and fifth,

02:06.228 --> 02:17.703
fourth and the third, first and second. When you 
attended, what grades did you use there? I was

02:21.728 --> 02:25.292
there from the third grade on. I think I went to 
McKinley High School President McKinley.

02:33.120 --> 02:39.006
McKinley High School, or grade school in St. Joe 
and then we moved to the country. You have to say you

02:39.026 --> 02:40.588
got the basics there. I got the basics out in the 
woods, out in Stony Point.

02:46.254 --> 02:49.978
We used to have pie suppers.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.181
Let me shut it off. I went to Benton High School in 
St. Joe, Missouri from out in the country,

03:00.509 --> 03:06.139
commuted back and forth, lived on the farm. We had 
an 80 acres farm out there and graduated from high

03:06.359 --> 03:13.611
school in 1938. I was in 4-H all my years from the 
12th on. I won two trips to Chicago in the 4-H.

03:25.805 --> 03:30.551
Ordinarily, you only win one to get to go to the 
International at Chicago. I won a trip in 1935, and

03:31.692 --> 03:48.752
my sister won one in 36, and then I won one in 37, I 
think it was, my second one, which was very unusual

03:31.692 --> 03:48.752
in that you only win one. And I graduated from high 
school in Benton, high school in 38, I immediately

03:57.479 --> 04:10.518
went to North Carolina, Gastonia, North Carolina 
to work for my uncle, Dr. Spring, and Dr. Ross had a

03:57.479 --> 04:10.518
hospital in Gastonia. I worked there as a chemical 
boy. Dr. Spring graduated from Veterinary

04:13.102 --> 04:15.986
Medicine at Kansas State. Kansas State. I think 
his graduation year was 32.

04:24.999 --> 04:25.680
I'm not sure. During the Depression. Thirty-two? 
Thirty, thirty-two. He graduated a long time ago,

04:30.331 --> 04:33.837
all right. He was in Gastonia. Yeah, he was in 
Gastonia at the time with, in practice with Dr.

04:35.279 --> 04:49.120
Ross and while I was, I worked for him for a year and 
came back home and started into junior college.

04:50.382 --> 04:54.848
making my pre-vet schooling in the junior college 
at home. This is in St. Joe. In St. Joe. In the

04:59.214 --> 05:00.916
meantime, the war broke out. I worked on the NYA and

05:01.557 --> 05:13.894
attended college and tried to make a living, 
worked for Sears, Roebuck's, making a few dollars

05:01.557 --> 05:13.894
to get through college. In the meantime, Dr. 
Spring had sold out in North Carolina and moved to

05:17.180 --> 05:20.965
Corpus Christi, Texas. Never heard of the place 
before, and he just came here from North Carolina.

05:26.552 --> 05:27.453
Yes. The St. Joseph's of Missouri was a veterinary 
school, and you were acquainted with some of the

05:27.473 --> 05:32.679
old property there. What did it look like to you at 
that time? I was under Dr. Bailey. He was the old

05:37.585 --> 05:43.833
instructor at the old St. Joe Veterinary College 
when it was still in operation. The old school was

05:46.762 --> 06:15.182
abandoned and he had about what year about what 
year in the late 20s I guess uh he he bought or leased

05:46.762 --> 06:15.182
rented I don't know how what he had the old 
veterinary school as his hospital for quite some

05:46.762 --> 06:15.182
time and I uh hung around with him quite a bit uh did 
he teach clinical medicine he taught he taught in

05:46.762 --> 06:15.182
the veterinary school and He was one of the first 
men to diagnose anthrax on his own in those days,

06:16.073 --> 06:24.826
and they told him he was crazy. Was he a 
bacteriologist? He was a pretty good

06:26.369 --> 06:28.552
bacteriologist, I believe. And he was a 
clinician? Clinician for, in those days, he told

06:29.514 --> 06:38.267
me his story about his, when he diagnosed this 
anthrax and that he injected his own guinea pigs

06:38.618 --> 06:53.897
and retrieved the organism from the guinea pigs 
and had his background pretty well when the state

06:38.618 --> 06:53.897
men told him he didn't know what he's talking 
about, I guess. This was way back. Did he have, well

06:56.220 --> 07:01.046
it must have been way back, about 1915 perhaps or 
so. Yeah, it was in the early days. Yes. Did he have

07:04.410 --> 07:08.035
anything to do with the development of the 
vaccine, Carbazoo? I don't think he did. Of

07:09.815 --> 07:17.987
course, Ab Quinn, he knew Ab Quinn real good that 
started GenCell. And Quinn was pretty well, he

07:18.248 --> 07:25.738
worked with Quinn and knew him pretty well. They 
were buddies. And I think Quinn was the one that

07:27.721 --> 07:33.870
developed the vaccine, more or less, back then. 
What did you notice there in the veterinary school

07:34.846 --> 07:38.330
the buildings they had? Well of course in those 
days it was a lot of horses and large animals and

07:39.692 --> 08:00.837
they had they had a stable in there the old school I 
don't know whether it's still standing or not it's

07:39.692 --> 08:00.837
right across from the police station in uh St. Joe 
there it was right south of the the police station

07:39.692 --> 08:00.837
uh I could go there but I haven't been by to see if the 
building's still there. How many buildings were

08:04.363 --> 08:05.805
there altogether? It was just a big brick 
building. One building? With some classrooms and

08:09.431 --> 08:17.364
upstairs and then the main veterinary part was 
looked like a horse stable.

08:21.371 --> 08:24.035
The clinic then was downstairs and the classrooms 
upstairs. There was another old vet we used him on

08:24.135 --> 08:28.242
the farm by the name of Hokenbrink. that lived, 
that practiced there before Dr. Bailey took it

08:29.251 --> 08:32.434
over. Your intersection rooms were downstairs 
also for anatomy? Anatomy and everything was. In

08:40.683 --> 08:48.572
the meantime, some other officers and stuff had 
moved in, so I didn't know exactly what the

08:40.683 --> 08:48.572
veterinary school was like. Yes. But I do know 
there was, he practiced there in the old

08:49.493 --> 08:54.658
veterinary school. But you finished then two 
years in junior college, is that right, or just

08:55.699 --> 08:59.123
one? Two years, year and a half, two years. Then you 
applied at Iowa State? I applied to four different

09:03.650 --> 09:16.266
veterinary colleges, put in my application at 
Kansas State, Iowa State, Washington, and

09:03.650 --> 09:16.266
Colorado. I had four different applications in 
and this was during the war. We had declared war and

09:29.191 --> 09:38.587
I hadn't gotten into any of the vet schools, and two 
days before college opened, I received a telegram

09:29.191 --> 09:38.587
to come to Iowa State. I had never been there 
before, and I got in. I think Bernie Waters was the

09:41.813 --> 09:48.684
man's place that I took his place in college. 
Bernie

09:50.087 --> 09:54.895
joined the Navy. and dropped out of his class and I 
took his place. And then Bernie went to war. He was

10:02.947 --> 10:09.795
from a small Iowa town, I think, and it got pretty 
hot on him on draft, so he just up and joined. And

10:10.896 --> 10:15.000
this is my story as I understand it. And then Bernie 
came back and finished vet school later. But I took

10:20.746 --> 10:24.730
his position there. in our class. Your four years 
at Iowa State were rather uneventful. We had three

10:31.075 --> 10:33.818
years at Iowa State, straight through. Yes, but it 
was four years of veterinary school. Four years of

10:37.122 --> 10:40.025
veterinary school in three years, straight 
through.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.931
Seems we rather burned out that last summer, 
didn't we? We burned out all the way through. We

10:48.053 --> 10:51.136
kept grinding our, you know, we joined it. We got to 
be in the service the last 15 months, which was the

10:54.393 --> 10:58.999
best thing that ever happened to me because I was 
about to run out of money. I wondered where I was

10:59.719 --> 11:00.681
going. You were too. Yes, I know that. You left 
there and immediately you came down and joined Dr.

11:04.685 --> 11:08.710
Spring in Corpus Christi. In Corpus Christi. We 
graduated from school. They shipped us to Fort

11:11.714 --> 11:13.296
Sheridan. Fort Sheridan

11:14.317 --> 11:21.025
gave us transportation back to our hometown. And 
in the meantime, I had purchased a car from a barber

11:21.916 --> 11:31.649
there in Ames on Main Street, old Frank, old Buck, 
the barber. I don't know whether you catch your

11:32.190 --> 11:39.120
hair or not, but old Buck sold me that 1940 Ford, and 
I drove it all the way to Texas. I picked up Dr.

11:39.901 --> 11:48.132
Spring's wife out at Mount Hope, Kansas, and was 
down here three days later. It started down with

11:48.152 --> 11:49.794
the... It came to Corpus. Never been in the state of 
Texas in my life, and started to work for Dr. Spring

11:51.920 --> 12:03.372
in 1944, right after we graduated, as soon as we got 
out of the Army. He'd already been in practice here

12:04.053 --> 12:08.057
about five years, hadn't he? Let's see, he moved, 
yeah, about three, four, let's see, 38, 39, or 40,

12:08.077 --> 12:15.325
about 40, about four years. That was a 3500 Santa 
Fe, right? Yeah, well, he bought... 4500 Santa Fe.

12:20.624 --> 12:22.065
4100 Santa Fe. He had bought the old vet, one of the 
oldest vet hospitals in Corpus. He bought out

12:27.330 --> 12:34.316
there right by Spahn Hospital, right across the 
street, and then he moved out in the country and

12:27.330 --> 12:34.316
built that place. It was way out in the country. 
Then? Then. He built Spring Hospital, had lots of

12:40.221 --> 12:50.209
lawsuits, had to sue to get hooked up to water, and 
They were going to stop him from building it. He

12:52.413 --> 12:57.337
bought three acres out there in the country.

12:58.218 --> 12:59.079
How could they sue him? He wasn't in the city limits 
anywhere, was he? Well, it was outside the city,

13:01.821 --> 13:08.147
but there was a water line going by there, and they 
wouldn't, he had to sue them to get hooked onto the

13:01.821 --> 13:08.147
water. They were trying to keep him from hooking 
onto the water system. There was a main water line

13:12.111 --> 13:17.496
going out of Santa Fe, out towards the cemetery 
there. How did you find practice when you first

13:18.590 --> 13:20.754
began? I've never known a slow day in my life, in my 
practice time, I don't believe. We jumped in full

13:26.985 --> 13:39.787
feet, both always had more business than we, never 
looked for any business, always had more than we

13:26.985 --> 13:39.787
needed or wanted. Could work seven days a week and 
long hours. What did you feel were some of the

13:45.758 --> 13:49.984
greatest problems you encountered when you first 
began? I know ticks were bad then. Ticks were

13:51.526 --> 13:52.648
really bad. I used to pick ticks before you had some 
insecticide that would, I think about the first

13:52.668 --> 14:06.407
one that came along that was really good was 
Carson's powder that helped us out a lot. Mr.

14:08.309 --> 14:13.977
Carson down in the valley made that powder and 
shipped it all over the country. It was a lifesaver

14:15.627 --> 14:18.070
for a long time.

14:21.375 --> 14:24.519
Of course, Maine was real bad. We still have DDT. I 
think Maine's writing as of today is worse than

14:31.389 --> 14:39.560
I've seen it since I've been in practice. Really, 
sarcoptic Maine. I think it's probably due to Not

14:44.804 --> 14:54.597
having DDT being banned, sarcoptic mange, is one 
of my big, big problems. Okay. As you got along, you

14:54.738 --> 14:57.822
stayed at Santa Fe yourself. You bought out the 
practice then, didn't you? I bought Doc Spring

14:59.604 --> 15:00.986
out. I had Doc Spriggle came in with me, and he got 
called into the service. They tried to call us

15:08.657 --> 15:09.939
back. They called you back. They tried to call me 
back and I had picked up undulant fever in the

15:11.669 --> 15:21.099
meantime working on some cattle and they didn't 
want me. So I escaped the active service due to my

15:22.200 --> 15:32.211
undulant fever being pretty active at the time.

15:32.551 --> 15:33.893
That was in about 1950 what? 52? When you bought out 
the hospital? When I bought out the hospital? I

15:40.240 --> 15:41.541
bought the hospital in 48, 49, I guess I'd have to go 
back and look at my papers, but I think it was around

15:42.820 --> 15:48.005
then. I know Dr. Spriggle came in and worked for me. 
Dr. Botard worked for me a little while. See, he got

15:57.414 --> 15:58.655
on the state board. Did you see that? Botard is? 
Botard is on the livestock commission. Oh, he is?

16:05.562 --> 16:06.463
They just appointed him. Oh. New appointment. I 
saw it just the other day. Botard worked for me for a

16:10.867 --> 16:34.782
little while, and Dr. Dwelley worked for us for a 
while, and Dr. Norton came down from Snow Blind and

16:10.867 --> 16:34.782
worked for a while, and let's see, there was quite a 
few people worked, you know, a short time, not as a

16:10.867 --> 16:34.782
more or less a training jumping off spot, Then what 
year did you build the new hospital out at Windsor

16:35.791 --> 16:40.036
Park? I built, I started it in 53, 52,

16:40.096 --> 16:47.504
53. I built, I worked on it. I sold Dr. Sprigle, the 
old spring hospital, and built Windsor Park, ran

16:50.507 --> 17:01.819
it a couple years, and turn around sold it to Dr. 
Pike. Moved over here in 50, 56. I bought this place

17:06.501 --> 17:32.210
in 55 and then I ran the hospital and ran back and 
forth from here and finally I decided just to I had

17:06.501 --> 17:32.210
Dr. Paget working for me his brother Richard and 
then Martin and Richard bought the place and I

17:06.501 --> 17:32.210
moved over here and that's where I've been ever 
since. Your practice has been Instead of here,

17:35.208 --> 17:42.176
although you've always claimed you've been 
semi-retired over here, what year did you move

17:35.208 --> 17:42.176
over here to Ingleside? 56. 56. That is almost 30 
years. 57. I was established, I built the hospital

17:47.502 --> 17:51.446
in 56, 57. You've been here for 24 years. Yeah. I 
came over here, was going to slow down, got

17:56.251 --> 18:04.320
involved with a bad deal and had to keep going, 
working. Well, the working hasn't hurt you any?

18:07.230 --> 18:13.218
I've done large animal practice, quite a little 
bit of large animal, and then I've kind of

18:07.230 --> 18:13.218
gradually weaned it away and left it. What are the 
biggest changes in practice that you've seen?

18:17.584 --> 18:22.010
First of all, of course, your practice over there 
in Corpus Christi was mostly small animal. What's

18:22.731 --> 18:28.259
been the big change in practice that you've seen 
from beginning to till now in small animal

18:22.731 --> 18:28.259
practice? Well, in small animal practice, we 
worked with Dr. Green, developing distemperoid

18:33.157 --> 18:42.366
vaccine, Dr. Spring did, and he was working with 
Dr. Green in developing the green method of

18:33.157 --> 18:42.366
vaccination. I remember old virogen, three-shot 
method for distemper shots, and they were given

18:42.386 --> 18:55.398
those and not having too active an immunity. 
Distemper is one thing that we don't see a lot of

19:01.152 --> 19:02.754
like we used to. I remember the distemper ward in 
North Carolina when we tried to immunize those

19:02.794 --> 19:30.653
foxhounds for those we had a lot of foxhound people 
over there that ran the whole packs of foxhounds

19:02.794 --> 19:30.653
and I remember those distemper hounds smell them 
and see them in my sleep and uh we came along when

19:02.794 --> 19:30.653
sulfa drugs were just coming out remember doctors 
sending me to the drugstore to get the maybe a dozen

19:30.903 --> 19:59.425
pills of sulfathiazole and sulfadizine and 
sulfamethazine and all of these sulfas that came

19:30.903 --> 19:59.425
as they came out came out before we had penicillin 
nobody there wasn't a penicillin to be had we

19:30.903 --> 19:59.425
started getting a few bottles of penicillin 
bootleg so to speak from a naval base when they

19:30.903 --> 19:59.425
first the old aqueous penicillin

20:00.316 --> 20:08.868
The vets that are graduating nowadays don't even 
know what it was like to practice without these

20:00.316 --> 20:08.868
antibiotics and all these sulfur drugs. We didn't 
have them. Of course, they didn't do much good for

20:10.910 --> 20:12.713
distemper. No. We thought they were going to do us a 
little good. You know, we tried blood

20:16.458 --> 20:20.283
transfusion. We tried making our own serum from 
dogs. Anything to try to help. and we didn't have

20:28.295 --> 20:30.318
too good a success. We used many a dose of 
distemperoid direct from, from laboratories,

20:30.999 --> 20:42.475
shipped once a week, we'd get a supply into the 
hospital. You used that in treatment at that time

20:42.835 --> 20:45.179
also? We were treated, we used two double dose of 
them, we used it in every shape or form on Dr.

20:45.199 --> 20:57.576
Green's recommendation, trying to develop some 
type of protection. I have a lot of fun kidding some

20:58.535 --> 21:07.867
of the young ones about they come in here and want to 
know about this new keroside medicine. I pull out

21:08.668 --> 21:16.017
my old file and tell them, hell, I was treating dogs 
before you was born with that keroside. And they

21:16.037 --> 21:17.759
said, oh, it's a new drug. I said, no. They said, you 
want to see my file? And I grabbed this little file

21:20.923 --> 21:23.527
over here. It's usually sitting right here on top. 
I think I buried it here today. You know, this kind

21:28.184 --> 21:31.427
of floor is a bunch of them. I grabbed this file 
here, and I say, what new drug are you talking

21:32.648 --> 21:38.333
about? We started keroside back in the late 40s. 
Yeah, and I said, you want to see how long ago I

21:41.455 --> 21:46.940
treated dogs with keroside? I said, here's a 
telegram. You want to see it? See that date on it? I

21:51.804 --> 21:54.447
said, here's the old original. I said, you want to 
see when we used it? This is 18 January, 1949. 48.

22:01.239 --> 22:09.369
Here's a letter from Letterly Laboratories in 
February of 49. Here's one in October of 48. I

22:11.412 --> 22:18.921
said, that's how long I've been treating dogs. We 
started treating dogs with kerosene way back in

22:18.941 --> 22:22.246
48. Now, this is not a new drug. It's just a 
different form of it. Yes, that's right. And I

22:30.643 --> 22:34.207
said, that's the original pamphlet, right there. 
Of course, the ethylcarbamidine was used, is now

22:36.810 --> 22:41.635
used to... Prevent it. Prevent it as a hilaricide. 
At that time, we also had arsenical compounds that

22:45.540 --> 22:56.832
we began to treat the adult worms with, and of 
course, we had a lot of trouble with embolism until

22:45.540 --> 22:56.832
we learned to keep the dogs quiet. Well, that was in 
the very early 50s and the late 40s. Late 48, 49 when

23:02.041 --> 23:04.345
that was taking place. They're still using 
kerosite and lots of it. Cartworms still, still a

23:06.790 --> 23:10.177
scourge up here in Corpus Christi, aren't they? 
Oh, man. I don't think we have the, well, the ones

23:11.700 --> 23:17.571
that are really religious and give it every day, 
and they do pretty good. You're talking about the

23:20.977 --> 23:23.621
diethylcarbamazine. Yeah, that's here. Filler 
bits. You can't hardly have a bird dog up here,

23:26.765 --> 23:31.352
unless you do it, however, because they just... 
They won't last. No. See, that's distemper and

23:35.077 --> 23:40.445
heartworms. Of course, you talked about 
sarcoptic manes off and on being bad. The other

23:44.737 --> 23:50.706
infectious hepatitis never did get to be the big 
scourge they thought it would, did they? No, and we

23:50.726 --> 23:53.390
had a dog show.

23:56.294 --> 24:00.841
Lepto hit us one time real bad and wiped out a few. 
Now I still think back sometimes I wonder whether

24:00.861 --> 24:07.891
we didn't have something similar to Parvo. 
Remember that dog show that all those high-priced

24:08.151 --> 24:12.718
dogs died? Were you here or do you remember that? I 
don't recall that. That was when? Boy that was in

24:17.201 --> 24:21.925
40, must have been around 48, 49. There was a bench 
show in Corpus Christi? They had a big dog show in

24:24.247 --> 24:40.562
Corpus and man champion boxers and champion this 
and champion that was just dropping dead and they

24:24.247 --> 24:40.562
overnight and I don't know whether a diagnosis was 
ever We had what they called Virus X back in those

24:41.403 --> 24:45.108
days. I don't know. Do you remember Virus X? No. 
Huh? No. Virus X and the Coca-Cola being the

24:49.574 --> 24:57.465
treatment for it, vomiting. I always had it turned 
over in my mind. I wondered if Parvo wasn't there

25:00.569 --> 25:03.372
then. Parvo wasn't back there and hit us like that 
because it killed them. They just collapsed, just

25:07.798 --> 25:10.482
like this Parvo disease almost. Bloody diarrhea. 
Parvo started here in around 1979. Just came in and

25:17.148 --> 25:20.953
wiped dogs out by the thousands. What's it done now 
that three years has gone by in your practice?

25:23.796 --> 25:24.857
Mine's slowed down. I don't have too many of them. I 
see one once in a while in a puppy, I think. But as far

25:29.642 --> 25:36.690
as the major thing when it was wiping them out, it 
hit hard. Oh, I'll tell you what was our biggest

25:37.071 --> 25:40.975
thing, and I'll I don't know whether you had it, but 
it was the V.E. epidemic of 1970. Yes, it came

25:47.027 --> 25:51.211
through the valley first. Go ahead tell us about 
what happened up here in Coastal Bend. V.E. hit

25:54.214 --> 25:57.937
here in July of 1970. Seventy?

26:02.041 --> 26:02.481
Was it?

26:07.006 --> 26:09.628
Possibly or a little later.

26:11.093 --> 26:11.814
71. July of 71. This

26:14.678 --> 26:22.971
was probably our area was the hardest hit of any 
area. I don't know whether the valley was hit as

26:23.592 --> 26:27.899
hard as we were. The valley was hit very hard. We 
lost probably before the vaccine was established

26:30.062 --> 26:37.293
we probably lost half the horses. Half of your 
horse population? July was red hot in here. July

26:43.666 --> 26:45.929
11th, 10th, 20th. I'm just looking.

26:50.393 --> 26:59.703
I lost 100 horses in my practice, which is a lot of 
horses. And my daughter made this scrapbook out of

26:59.723 --> 27:07.071
all the articles.

27:08.553 --> 27:10.875
It's surprising how, how it came in. Here it is 
right there. You see that? Yes.

27:17.402 --> 27:19.223
You said something you didn't like quarantine? 
No, I wrapped the quarantine. They, they act like

27:21.245 --> 27:23.968
it was going to stop at the New Asia River. And they 
wouldn't give us any vaccine north of the New Asia

27:26.510 --> 27:29.313
River. Oh really? Yes. The quarantine was lapped 
on and we couldn't get any vaccine. And just

27:35.419 --> 27:37.581
because we lived on the other side of the river, 
they wouldn't issue us any vaccine. We lost, I

27:42.750 --> 27:49.459
talked to Dr., what's his name, out of King Ranch?

27:49.519 --> 27:49.819
Morrill. Morrill? He came into my office here. 
They didn't have any because they used the vaccine

27:54.605 --> 28:00.933
early, and we didn't get the vaccine until later. 
That book right there has got the whole history of

28:02.996 --> 28:06.420
what happened here. Surprisingly enough, VWE 
came through, and of course we've all vaccinated

28:08.729 --> 28:14.520
since, but it's disappeared. But do you realize 
they're still recovering the virus from

28:14.600 --> 28:18.668
mosquitoes in the valley? Are they doing it here 
too? Possibly. They caught mosquitoes around

28:21.814 --> 28:25.100
here for a long time. I haven't seen a mosquito man 
for a long time.

28:34.683 --> 28:37.787
Well, that's very interesting that the virus is in 
the mosquitoes, but... Hadn't hit the horses,

28:37.887 --> 28:38.908
huh? A lot of vaccine and no more cases. Well, I've 
vaccinated a pretty good percentage of the horses

28:40.810 --> 28:49.881
for three or four years afterwards. Now, there may 
be a population of young horses and all that just

28:49.921 --> 28:55.988
kind of sneak back. It could hit again sometime in 
the future. Looking back on your practice, you

28:59.873 --> 29:03.357
know, we've had these viral enteritis symptoms. 
of cattle. Do you really think in your mind we had

29:06.040 --> 29:12.770
that back at the time that we graduated from school 
back in the early middle 40s? What you mean BVD?

29:14.873 --> 29:15.093
Yes. About bovine virus diarrhea? We probably 
did. Didn't recognize what it was. We call them

29:21.182 --> 29:27.572
bloody scars and passed them off as

29:29.392 --> 29:51.254
I know I worked at feedlots when that BVD was so bad 
and we had one year it looked like we had pneumonia

29:29.392 --> 29:51.254
in cattle here that nothing phased nothing 
stopped and the medication you just well pour a

29:29.392 --> 29:51.254
bucket of water over top of them and do as much good 
as the medicine did. And you were you've been

29:52.475 --> 29:59.162
pleased with the vaccines on uh on viral enteritis 
haven't you? I think it's taken care of a lot of the

29:59.935 --> 30:02.758
problems. I'm out of that type of practice right 
now. I haven't been keeping up with it, but I did for

30:05.261 --> 30:12.810
a long time use the feedlots. I had lots of lots of 
vaccine go through those feedlots and they they

30:14.292 --> 30:23.463
controlled it pretty well by vaccinating. These 
suburbanites still love their horses, don't

30:23.483 --> 30:25.946
they? Yeah, still going horse crazy. My horse 
practice suffered considerable during the VE

30:28.977 --> 30:35.167
epidemic. When you lose a hundred horses out of an 
area, it's noticeable. And it didn't have a

30:42.098 --> 30:46.645
respect of the horses. It didn't have to be a 
blooded horse. It didn't have to be a nag. When it

30:51.292 --> 30:54.377
hit, wiped them out. You've been in veterinary 
medicine now for 40 years, counting some of the

30:55.353 --> 31:01.663
time you were in school, in the clinics. As you look 
back on practice and so forth, do you have any

31:02.925 --> 31:15.965
comment on whether or not the profession could 
have done better, or that you could have done

31:02.925 --> 31:15.965
differently, or anything like that? Or would you 
think things would have proceeded almost the

31:16.005 --> 31:19.290
same? I think it probably proceeded just about the 
same.

31:26.588 --> 31:39.963
I remember about 1940

31:26.588 --> 31:39.963
when the investigator for the state association,

31:26.588 --> 31:39.963
no, let me see. Yeah, he was with the state 
association. It wasn't the board that he was with.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.550
He was with the state association. And we had an old 
plaque down there.
