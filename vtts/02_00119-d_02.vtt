WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:04.410
after this comment. Okay.

00:12.639 --> 00:17.565
I'm trying to find the details of how I brought this 
to the board. Okay.

00:23.572 --> 00:32.502
I told the board I'll make every effort I can to work 
with President Miller in an amicable situation.

00:34.979 --> 00:36.941
I went to Jarvis and told him that.

00:43.328 --> 00:55.420
I subsequently

00:43.328 --> 00:55.420
made a trip

00:43.328 --> 00:55.420
by air to every board member's location. That was 
when I took to each of them this reorganization

00:57.622 --> 01:03.248
plan. And it was at that time that I picked up the 
strong sentiment in the direction that I'm

01:04.055 --> 01:11.382
talking about.

01:14.386 --> 01:26.458
I came back and was asked how I had come out in my 
efforts to work amicably, and I indicated that I

01:14.386 --> 01:26.458
didn't think it was working. I was getting signals 
which I thought were authentic. that in his staff

01:33.738 --> 01:46.631
meetings and on other occasions he would blast the 
chancellor's office openly, disparagingly,

01:33.738 --> 01:46.631
what's the word? Disparagingly,

01:46.651 --> 01:52.136
I think. That's what I came out with, but it didn't 
feel right, but in a negative way.

02:02.948 --> 02:12.597
So

02:02.948 --> 02:12.597
they said, well, okay. They called in separately 
to meet with them in executive session in my

02:12.617 --> 02:31.234
absence, Perry Atkinson and Fred Benson, to ask 
them if they thought this reorganization plan was

02:12.617 --> 02:31.234
workable.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.106
I don't know how Perry reacted to it. The strong 
agriculturalist

02:39.808 --> 02:49.282
in him, I think, he had some reservations about it. 
I believe Benson supported it wholeheartedly,

02:50.964 --> 02:58.455
saying it probably was a good idea.

03:03.762 --> 03:04.343
At any rate,

03:07.833 --> 03:14.559
When I got back and went to the board, made

03:07.833 --> 03:14.559
the recommendation for.

03:18.062 --> 03:21.045
No.

03:21.065 --> 03:22.006
One member of the board. Said

03:22.046 --> 03:30.914
we shouldn't leave this thing to Frank. To take the 
entire onus of. We've got to carry a part of the

03:34.317 --> 03:37.080
burden ourselves. I hereby recommend that we 
terminate the services of President Miller.

03:45.745 --> 03:46.206
Period. It was seconded. And I said, gentlemen, 
before you vote on this motion, let me make a

03:50.013 --> 03:55.503
comment, if you will.

03:59.451 --> 04:01.735
Let's reassign this gentleman. Let's not 
terminate him. We have previously gotten

04:04.471 --> 04:12.904
ourselves into trouble by terminating a person, a 
tenured person. I looked into the tenure. I had

04:15.107 --> 04:17.711
earlier looked into the tenure of President 
Miller. He was tenured, but the tenure never

04:18.372 --> 04:27.486
originated from the department, was not reviewed 
by the department.

04:29.828 --> 04:35.714
I don't know how it could have happened, but 
apparently President Miller took it to the board

04:29.828 --> 04:35.714
for him to have tenure. Or some board member 
offered it to the board. I'm not sure. But he was

04:41.501 --> 04:42.882
tenured. And I told the board, let's not play the 
game again of getting ourselves in trouble over a

04:44.023 --> 04:52.933
tenure matter, if you will. reassign him to the 
chancellor's office and I'll take care of it from

04:55.242 --> 05:01.047
there. So they made that motion and it passed.

05:09.656 --> 05:15.001
After that, we talked about a successor, an 
interim successor. I was asked to name two or three

05:15.021 --> 05:17.002
people. I named Harry Kunkel and Charles Sampson. 
Charles Sampson, mainly because of my experience

05:21.747 --> 05:25.030
with him, on the board of directors of the Bank of 
A&M. I thought he was a good board member.

05:37.976 --> 05:44.007
It was probably the weakest decision I ever made, 
Haskell. It wasn't a good decision at all. And I

05:47.639 --> 05:49.241
wasn't aware that it wouldn't be. But when I named 
those two names, one board member said, well,

05:49.901 --> 05:56.608
we've had agriculturalists for some time. Let's 
try an engineer.

06:01.393 --> 06:04.016
So that's how Chuck got in on an interim basis. And 
that was on a Wednesday afternoon? I don't know. It

06:07.019 --> 06:16.228
was a... Was this the same day that Jarvis was 
called over and told of the decision that he... No.

06:16.850 --> 06:23.143
I don't think Jarvis was ever called over and given 
by the board advance notice that this was going to

06:16.850 --> 06:23.143
happen. Oh, no, no, no. But I was thinking of the day 
that he was told it had happened, that as of this

06:25.007 --> 06:32.824
point you are no longer the president. No, no. It 
happened right in his presence. He was at the board

06:38.005 --> 06:46.783
meeting, and the board called him in after the 
executive session and said, President Miller, we

06:38.005 --> 06:46.783
are reassigning you. Now, that happened on a 
Wednesday. because you and I chatted in your

06:50.380 --> 07:12.613
office on Tuesday morning as I was saying goodbye, 
thank you for all that you've meant to me from the

06:50.380 --> 07:12.613
seventh grade through the 12th grade, and then as 
dean, and you asked me, because you really caught

06:50.380 --> 07:12.613
my attention, you said, who are the five best 
department heads on the campus, as I was ready to

06:50.380 --> 07:12.613
leave. I said, huh? And then you said, start with 
engineering. And so I mentioned Charlie Holland.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.545
And you said, well, what about Chuck Sampson? And I 
said, well, he's not a department head. You asked

07:26.370 --> 07:27.351
me why. And I didn't want to tell you that a number of 
the senior faculty had gone to Benson to say,

07:28.013 --> 07:37.488
Chuck's really not leading us as well now as he was. 
I didn't want to. All right, I go back and I told Mac

07:39.436 --> 07:58.773
that, and I said, Mac, I think I know who the new vice 
chancellor for engineering at the system level

07:39.436 --> 07:58.773
might be, because we'd heard a rumor that there 
might be a vice chancellor for engineering and a

07:39.436 --> 07:58.773
vice chancellor for agriculture, Adkisson being 
one of them. And that was on Tuesday, and then

07:59.374 --> 08:05.960
Jarvis is... The decision is made on Wednesday... 
And I hear about it that night in the wee hours in El

08:08.765 --> 08:14.313
Paso.

08:18.478 --> 08:19.480
You want to quit for today? Yeah, that's a good 
time.

08:24.967 --> 08:27.691
Okay, we're checking to be sure that this is 
working. Transcriber, this is, I believe, the

08:28.552 --> 08:32.578
11th of May. I mean, 11th of April, and when we 
transcribe it, we will just indicate that these

08:32.744 --> 08:40.814
interviews were done on three days. Check yours, 
Dr. Hubert. Okay, and this is the third day, and

08:43.518 --> 08:49.846
we're starting at about almost 10 o'clock.

08:52.570 --> 08:56.335
Let's see, chronologically, when we quit, you 
were the chancellor. We're into the 1980s, and...

09:02.444 --> 09:10.533
Dr. Sampson served as the interim president for a 
year and then searched for a new A&M president. Can

09:11.134 --> 09:18.602
you summarize that search and how the selection of 
Dr. Vandiver came about? Yes, we advertised

09:21.245 --> 09:30.055
nationally, received a number of applications, 
Vandiver was not one of them, and proceeded with

09:31.537 --> 09:52.247
the search in the customary fashion, narrowed it 
down to a few people and had interviews with them.

09:53.168 --> 09:56.633
Really never did find the zinger that turned the 
board on and the search committee. The board had

10:00.384 --> 10:03.568
appointed a search committee also. During the 
course of this search, the local newspaper, the

10:03.608 --> 10:23.616
Eagle, pushed and pushed for lists of candidates, 
the short list, and wanted to know all of the

10:03.608 --> 10:23.616
procedures that were going on and such. The board 
had decided we would not release this

10:24.727 --> 10:28.793
information. And I stood by that. And as a 
consequence, I personally was

10:32.918 --> 10:50.582
challenged in the courts by the EGLE for not 
releasing the names of the applicants and the

10:32.918 --> 10:50.582
short list and so on. And as you might know, the 
eagle prevailed. The court ruled in favor of the

10:58.559 --> 11:01.182
eagle. A&M, Mr. Hubert, you've got to release 
these names and release them now. And, of course,

11:08.250 --> 11:11.434
we did in compliance with the court order.

11:16.439 --> 11:20.063
We had also a...

11:20.937 --> 11:28.712
a professional search firm out of Dallas who was 
giving us names of individuals. And

11:30.055 --> 11:40.836
we really didn't get a lot of help from them.

11:41.963 --> 11:50.535
They were more helpful later on in the search for a 
chancellor for my replacement when I retired. But

11:50.976 --> 12:05.736
back to the course,

11:50.976 --> 12:05.736
the

11:50.976 --> 12:05.736
selection finally just almost came to a halt.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.464
The board didn't really feel comfortable 
strongly about any of the applicants or

12:12.946 --> 12:17.894
candidates.

12:21.339 --> 12:40.810
Frank Vandiver came into the picture as a 
consequence of

12:21.339 --> 12:40.810
my suggesting his name as a potential candidate 
and another board member I think it was John

12:42.798 --> 12:48.005
Blocker of Houston supporting it strongly. And he 
was invited to submit his credentials. He was then

12:54.374 --> 12:58.419
at North Texas State University as president. He 
did submit his credentials.

13:04.448 --> 13:10.476
The

13:04.448 --> 13:10.476
board had a meeting in Dallas at which time we 
invited Mr. Vandiver to come down from Denton and

13:12.447 --> 13:19.119
spend several hours with us. He did. And as a result 
of that meeting, he was selected as president.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.604
And that started the Vandiver years. I think 
Vandiver's great accomplishments were in the

13:38.468 --> 13:55.690
realm of improving faculty relationships with 
the administration and in removing A&M's name

13:38.468 --> 13:55.690
from the black list of the American Association of 
University Professors. Frank, I think almost

13:56.971 --> 14:07.665
single-handedly in several trips to AAUP 
headquarters and visiting with them was able to

14:08.185 --> 14:14.672
have A&M cleared of any problems with AAUP. Now, 
what was the next part? All right, and you

14:17.976 --> 14:24.523
and he worked together for about how long before 
your retirement? Don't recall. I don't recall

14:26.285 --> 14:28.047
that timeline. You retired when? I retired in

14:29.788 --> 14:35.455
July the 1st, 82. What were, as you... were 
approaching that date, what were your feelings

14:38.510 --> 14:45.176
about your career at A&M? Oh, they were so strongly 
positive, Haskell. I felt what a good fortune had

14:50.161 --> 14:57.068
fallen upon me when I came to A&M. It was a moment in 
time where A&M was ready to move forward And I was

15:06.944 --> 15:33.053
happy to be swept up into the momentum of that 
movement and all of the subsequent events and

15:06.944 --> 15:33.053
happenings that took place, the venture study, 
the aspiration study, the implementation of

15:06.944 --> 15:33.053
those studies, the reorganization of the 
university from a

15:33.961 --> 15:41.593
four degree granting segments to what, now 10 or 
11. And simply the opportunity to be a part of that

15:42.875 --> 16:02.685
renaissance at Texas A&M was just absolutely 
exhilarating. And surprisingly, to close out my

16:03.847 --> 16:16.875
A&M career after serving in three deanships, each 
for about a period of six years. I was a dean total 20

16:16.895 --> 16:22.767
years in three different colleges. to have the 
opportunity to move into the chancellor's office

16:24.569 --> 16:43.534
and succeed Jack Williams, albeit there was an 
interim in between, was absolutely a thrilling

16:24.569 --> 16:43.534
capstone to the A&M career. Some of the key people 
that you associated with, can you

16:44.755 --> 16:52.806
kind of describe their ability? Tom Cherry. Tom 
was very astute, outstanding, low profile, low

16:55.923 --> 17:12.978
key in his position, former experience in the 
business affairs of one of the major airlines.

17:13.058 --> 17:14.659
I've forgotten which one it was now. I want to say 
TWA. But nonetheless, Tom brought a good

17:16.741 --> 17:22.646
stability to the president's office. And I 
think...

17:27.800 --> 17:34.547
was good for President Rudder. Clyde Freeman.

17:38.592 --> 17:44.518
Clyde is an exceptionally astute business and 
finance person. I think he knew more about the

17:45.479 --> 17:55.029
permanent university fund and the available fund 
than anyone in our sector of the state. He was...

17:59.693 --> 18:10.388
He was

17:59.693 --> 18:10.388
a man filled with massive amounts of information, 
financial information.

18:12.731 --> 18:26.211
Historically, he was,

18:12.731 --> 18:26.211
from the historical perspective of the financial 
affairs of the university and the system, he was

18:12.731 --> 18:26.211
without a peer. He could recite a decade ago, two

18:29.815 --> 18:45.533
decades ago, and give you time, place, date, who, 
where, when, how, and why, that kind of a fellow, a

18:29.815 --> 18:45.533
big help.

18:49.957 --> 18:59.468
General Peel, the vice chancellor for physical 
facilities and construction, had come to the

19:00.427 --> 19:09.318
university system

19:00.427 --> 19:09.318
two or three years prior to my coming on the scene 
there. And he had a rich experience in the

19:10.700 --> 19:13.263
military. He was a, I think, a major or lieutenant, 
I guess a major general with the engineering corps

19:14.245 --> 19:27.902
of the armed forces. had handled massive 
construction projects before and was capable of

19:28.675 --> 19:48.479
working with a multi, multi-million dollar 
construction budget, overseeing everything

19:28.675 --> 19:48.479
that went on from the planning stages to the final 
completion. Just an outstanding talent.

19:56.941 --> 20:10.202
When you needed advice, to

19:56.941 --> 20:10.202
whom, I'm not going to ask you the negative, only 
the positive, to whom did you turn for advice and

19:56.941 --> 20:10.202
counsel first?

20:17.994 --> 20:23.843
I think it would be Clyde Freeman Haskell that I 
would visit with. He was always knowledgeable

20:26.253 --> 20:33.343
about board affairs and board matters. And 
although he did not have the background in

20:35.025 --> 20:44.278
academics,

20:46.081 --> 21:02.689
He had been associated with them sufficiently 
that he had a good insight into a proper course to

20:46.081 --> 21:02.689
follow, or questions to ask. And he was helpful all 
along. I would say particularly in budget matters

21:06.417 --> 21:13.912
and in preparation of materials for submission to 
the legislature. Bob Cherry

21:15.094 --> 21:22.770
was exceedingly helpful in legislative matters. 
Bob had earned the high respect of the people in

21:23.611 --> 21:46.933
Austin in the legislature as an adroit 
politician, lobbyist, spokesman for Texas A&M

21:23.611 --> 21:46.933
University and the system, and he was highly 
regarded by members of both the legislature and

21:23.611 --> 21:46.933
the Senate. He was helpful in

21:52.703 --> 22:05.284
reviewing the presentations I made to the various 
legislation hearing groups, the budget

21:52.703 --> 22:05.284
committees and so forth, and making suggestions 
for strengthening them. And he was a good help.

22:10.151 --> 22:19.707
When you went to Austin for court and board and or 
legislature, who were your key aides in those

22:10.151 --> 22:19.707
efforts? Politicians and or staff?

22:27.754 --> 22:35.123
I, Haskell, strangely enough, on those 
occasions,

22:27.754 --> 22:35.123
I traveled alone. But did you have anyone that 
would be your ally, key ally in your... Well, Bob

22:35.163 --> 22:44.594
Cherry was there present all the time. I felt that 
if I got into a ditch... or into a quandary about

22:48.560 --> 22:56.248
some issue or some question that was directed at 
me, I could turn to Bob for help. Clyde Freeman was

22:57.870 --> 23:02.175
usually along and I could get help from him. Did we 
have a system person in Austin pretty permanently

23:02.615 --> 23:09.343
during the legislative session? Not during my 
time, except during the latter years The purchase

23:14.328 --> 23:17.512
of the old. What's the name? Oh,

23:20.335 --> 23:30.246
that house in Austin, the house in Austin. Begins 
with an H. It was it was to be headquarters for a

23:31.287 --> 23:38.074
permanent residence in Austin. Oh John 
Hutchison. Was moved to Austin. Bob asked for an

23:45.783 --> 23:50.390
assistant to help him with legislative matters.

23:53.134 --> 24:11.082
During my term as chancellor,

23:53.134 --> 24:11.082
the board approved it, and during the session,

23:53.134 --> 24:11.082
John Hutchison would move to Austin and stay there 
on site. He didn't stay annually. He had come back

24:15.003 --> 24:19.488
at the close of the session, and he was a big help to 
Bob. Which legislators were A&M's best allies?

24:33.544 --> 24:39.110
Bill Moore, of course, in the Senate as chairman of 
the Finance Committee. Bill or anyone else who

24:41.268 --> 24:51.630
held that position could wield a lot of

24:41.268 --> 24:51.630
influence. In the house, there was a chap from up in 
the plains of Texas. I'm trying to remember his

24:58.184 --> 24:59.867
name. who was such a strong supporter, and he had a 
good, long tenure as a House of Representatives

25:01.417 --> 25:10.134
member. Not Heatley, was it? No, no. No. I don't 
think Heatley was a great supporter of Texas A&M.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.504
That's what I was going to be surprised. No, 
Heatley was not friendly to us. Because Dr.

25:27.074 --> 25:29.338
Williams used to call him S.O.B. Heatley, Sweet 
Old Bill.

25:36.370 --> 25:40.958
Heatley, I think, was from the Plains, too. 
Paducah. And he was essentially a Texas Tech man.

25:47.452 --> 25:51.419
Oh, he wanted a college of veterinary medicine at 
Tech.

25:54.203 --> 26:00.354
Now, let's see, some other key people that we want 
to be sure we touch on. One is Lloyd Heaton, a kind of

26:00.935 --> 26:07.806
a campus

26:00.935 --> 26:07.806
leader forever. Describe Lloyd Heaton and his 
characteristics.

26:15.152 --> 26:31.870
I think it's unusual in an institution for the 
registrar of that institution to evolve to such a

26:15.152 --> 26:31.870
place of recognition that Lloyd Heaton held. 
Lloyd was a kind, gentle, soft-spoken individual

26:33.908 --> 26:51.079
who was

26:33.908 --> 26:51.079
a member of all of the key committees. President 
Rutter, and he may have had this spot before

26:52.481 --> 26:58.532
President Rutter, I don't know, But at least with 
President Rutter, he was secretary of the

26:59.018 --> 27:06.168
executive committee. He was a member of the 
academic council. And Lloyd was, I think,

27:11.535 --> 27:25.093
important more for the information which he had 
and which he didn't talk about than for any other

27:11.535 --> 27:25.093
reason. Lloyd kept the minutes for the executive 
committee, and I think possibly for the academic

27:27.318 --> 27:39.008
council, as I recall.

27:42.351 --> 27:55.283
I don't remember so well the minutes of the 
academic council, but I do know that in the minutes

27:42.351 --> 27:55.283
for the executive committee, I was somewhat 
frustrated when I reviewed them at the end of a

27:42.351 --> 27:55.283
meeting The minutes never revealed who made a 
motion or who seconded it and what the vote was. It

28:07.335 --> 28:13.446
would simply indicate that a motion to do such and 
such was passed, period.

28:17.994 --> 28:21.220
Well, that told the essence of the story. But from 
the standpoint of building a history for an

28:21.470 --> 28:32.042
institution, it told very little about who did 
what and who supported and endorsed what. That

28:34.024 --> 28:40.191
seemed to be typical of many records at A&M.

28:43.234 --> 28:46.498
They didn't give the They didn't give the details 
of the action taken and the background for it. But

28:54.312 --> 29:04.652
Lloyd was the secretary of the academic council 
and the executive committee, and it was in that

28:54.312 --> 29:04.652
context that I knew him best. Also, occasionally 
I'd have I'd have cause to call upon him for help

29:09.698 --> 29:18.407
with some set of records or data and such. He was 
always willing to supply them and in good time.

29:25.354 --> 29:33.883
Transcriber, this is an editor's note that we will 
identify as editor's note. I have heard the story

29:34.741 --> 29:46.260
that Lloyd Heaton has said a number of times, 
quote, over my dead body will we ever have black

29:34.741 --> 29:46.260
students at Texas A&M, period, end quote. I also 
understand that just before the first black

29:47.241 --> 30:00.563
students enrolled, Mr. Rutter, having made that 
arrangement with great skill, called Mr. Heaton

29:47.241 --> 30:00.563
and told him to review the transcripts to be sure 
that each of those students was enrolled in the

30:00.813 --> 30:12.038
appropriate course in the appropriate section 
and that he, Lloyd Heaton, was to call each

30:00.813 --> 30:12.038
instructor of each of those sections to let them 
know that when they went to class the next day,

30:13.098 --> 30:31.680
there would be black students there, they had been 
duly admitted and enrolled, and that this was a

30:13.098 --> 30:31.680
call to be sure that there would be no problem and no 
misunderstanding. And as a result of that, the

30:32.943 --> 30:40.293
enrollment and attendance of the first black 
students could not have gone more smoothly. And

30:40.794 --> 30:47.243
Mr. Heaton carried out that assignment, as far as I 
recall, superbly. His commanding officer,

30:47.523 --> 30:51.328
President Rutter, had given him a direction and he 
followed it. End of note. When you became, who were

30:53.952 --> 31:02.123
your key staff officers in the, who were your key 
staff in your office when you became chancellor?

31:03.200 --> 31:04.462
When I became chancellor? Who were the key office 
people? You didn't take Peggy Ritchie with you, I

31:07.087 --> 31:09.511
don't think, did you? No. I didn't take Peggy with 
me, nor did I take Brian Cole with me. And the reason

31:17.285 --> 31:23.576
was that in Peggy's case, twofold. I knew that 
going to the chancellor's office was...
