WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:06.496
opposed to drinking. I had heard that he was a 
strong prohibitionist. Does that partly link

00:11.202 --> 00:15.288
back to his Baptist roots, you think? Well, 
probably maybe. I don't know about that. Was that a

00:20.274 --> 00:23.518
lifetime attitude for him? Yes.

00:27.706 --> 00:30.811
We never, ever had anything in our home. And he was 
so against the young people. And at A&M, it was, you

00:33.975 --> 00:42.167
got in real bad trouble if you were caught. All 
right, let's go back to, what were the important

00:44.150 --> 00:51.942
buildings at A&M when you all arrived? Well, you 
know, I have the vague idea recollection of that

00:56.748 --> 01:26.063
administration building it was a big 
old-fashioned now this is the new one or the one

00:56.748 --> 01:26.063
that this is not the one that burned this is the new 
one well it wouldn't be the new one maybe it was the

00:56.748 --> 01:26.063
one that burned i don't know about when one burned 
all right i'm thinking that you know they see the

00:56.748 --> 01:26.063
whole campus is different from what it was because 
there's a railroad station still that They tore it

01:26.836 --> 01:28.598
down about 10 years ago. They tore it down. You see, 
everything that came to the campus came on the, I

01:30.100 --> 01:37.350
keep wanting to say Southern Pacific. I'm not sure 
which branch it was. Southern Pacific and

01:39.773 --> 01:43.638
Burlington Rock Island both ran on that. They came 
on that track. And that's the way you got. You got

01:51.794 --> 01:57.563
off the train, and there were iron gates, as I 
remember, across that. And you know, this is all on

01:58.284 --> 02:02.190
the west side of what's there now. And you just came 
in those gates. And then there were this oval

02:06.316 --> 02:11.624
street. One went up this way and one this way. And 
the administration building, as I recall, was

02:14.148 --> 02:20.518
right here at the top of the oval. And then there 
were houses that came down this way, and the other

02:21.697 --> 02:27.566
side didn't have houses. But our house and the Kyle 
house and the Fountain house, there were

02:28.728 --> 02:39.144
different houses down the side there. And that 
was... Were there any trees of any size on the

02:43.430 --> 02:45.974
campus then? Yeah, seems like there were. But that 
train created quite a problem, because the

02:50.080 --> 03:00.514
students would go to Bryan. They said they had 
freight trains that came in there, too. And

03:03.458 --> 03:16.375
so the boys had a habit of hanging on the train or 
jumping holding on, then when they got the five

03:17.047 --> 03:23.516
miles out to college, they'd jump off. And one 
terrible

03:25.178 --> 03:41.961
time, I don't know whether this is of any interest, 
but this one student jumped off of the train, and it

03:25.178 --> 03:41.961
was terribly, really against the rules. They were 
not supposed to do that. And he jumped off. And it

03:46.392 --> 03:50.297
caught his arm some way and pulled it off. And he 
picked that arm up and walked up to the infirmary.

03:57.926 --> 04:09.220
Now, where the infirmary was back in those days

03:57.926 --> 04:09.220
was kind of angled off from the house where we 
lived. And my father did. But you wouldn't have any

04:12.160 --> 04:18.648
recollection of that because the whole school's 
different from now. But there was a convenience

04:19.469 --> 04:22.993
for my father to go. But he went over there every 
afternoon to check on the students that were sick.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.703
And they called him that night about this. And he 
got up and went over there. And I don't know the

04:35.047 --> 04:37.470
outcome of that. I'm sure they could then get it 
back on. I don't know. But things like that, that's

04:41.928 --> 04:52.584
the reason they didn't want them jumping on that 
train like that.

04:53.906 --> 04:59.234
During your years there, do you remember any other 
calamities? Were there any big fires or

04:59.294 --> 05:03.180
tornadoes? Well, I guess about the main thing, 
thing that i can remember is the flu epidemic that

05:11.543 --> 05:38.277
was really about really a bad one please describe 
that for us well i don't i can't really describe it

05:11.543 --> 05:38.277
except every day there'd be more students going 
getting into the the um and i guess they called it

05:11.543 --> 05:38.277
infirmary and

05:40.889 --> 05:43.031
And I don't remember. I think maybe there might 
have been a few deaths, but I'm not sure about that.

05:47.536 --> 05:53.261
Was the infirmary able to serve all of them, or did 
they have to send some of them back to the

05:47.536 --> 05:53.261
dormitories? Well, I don't remember about that, 
but I know they were really crowded and worried my

05:54.282 --> 06:00.929
father terribly.

06:04.653 --> 06:05.073
Let's see. You took A&M classes. Please describe 
some of the teachers that you remember, some of the

06:10.910 --> 06:18.602
good faculty members.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.058
Did you have English from Tommy Mayo, for example?

06:31.143 --> 06:32.505
No, I don't believe so. I can't remember many of the 
teachers.

06:43.613 --> 06:46.396
Well, those classes, were they easy? Were they 
rigorous? Well, they were hard for me because I

06:47.838 --> 06:57.529
always felt like the courses at A&M would be harder 
than any place else anyway. I don't know why. But I

06:58.590 --> 07:02.155
took what I thought were such hard courses. And I 
got along. I got along okay with them. But

07:06.600 --> 07:08.642
chemistry was... Not ever one of my favorite 
subjects. That was kind of hard for me. That was

07:14.549 --> 07:17.471
one, was that one of your harder courses? Well, it 
was for me. I always did like math. Not that it would

07:22.196 --> 07:38.730
ever do me any good, but it was like a game, you know, 
algebra and...

07:22.196 --> 07:38.730
Did, as far back as I know, There were many, many 
nicknames for faculty members and others. Were

07:44.126 --> 07:45.528
there nicknames then? Oh, there were nicknames 
for the students. I was going through this old

07:49.153 --> 07:55.020
book, and several of my friends were in there. And I 
noticed this one very handsome, married Lily Best

07:55.821 --> 08:04.752
Kyle, named Harry Baker. And his name was Trash. 
Everybody on the campus called him Trash. And the

08:11.941 --> 08:17.730
one I was dating with was his best friend. And his 
name was just plain old T. Lewis. They never did

08:22.236 --> 08:25.481
have a nickname for him. But we used to say. T. Lewis 
and Trash would come by and get Lilybeth and me, and

08:27.918 --> 08:33.583
we'd go dating. And, of course, the head yell 
leader was Catfish Goodman. Everybody knew

08:46.055 --> 08:47.937
Catfish Goodman.

08:50.919 --> 08:52.321
Were they called yell leaders then? Why, 
certainly. You don't think they'd be called

08:55.508 --> 08:58.031
cheerleaders, do you? Well, I was wondering. 
Well, I should say not. That's like Texas

09:01.316 --> 09:02.918
University. That's right, that's right. No, we 
used to make more fun of, you know, cheerleaders,

09:08.205 --> 09:18.900
and that was just a bad word. And then the way the... 
the way the band leader went with all the prancing.

09:30.510 --> 09:31.492
They all do that. Bands do that. Was the band very 
much respected then? Oh, you bet. And it sure is

09:38.981 --> 09:40.684
now. My son lives in Enid for several years. His 
good friend was in the press box at the Mall Games.

09:58.962 --> 10:08.914
And

09:58.962 --> 10:08.914
he wanted Lee to help him with spotting the team, so 
Lee was in the press box with him. And they've

10:08.934 --> 10:19.026
always kidding me about Texas A&M, because I made 
such a silly thing out of it for myself. the A&M oh I

10:20.812 --> 10:48.068
tell you what about this I'll switch up back to 
something when I was in Texas University the

10:20.812 --> 10:48.068
that was the year that my father was invited to come 
to OU and so he called me one day and he said I've been

10:20.812 --> 10:48.068
invited to come to be president of Oklahoma 
University. And he said, I'm talking to the family

10:53.107 --> 10:55.729
about it. He said, now, what would you think about 
it if I should take that position? And of course, I

11:03.878 --> 11:08.243
said just what anybody would have said. If that's 
what you want to do, then that's what you must do. I

11:13.369 --> 11:15.992
think that was a compliment to you. And I should say 
it. that just think it over good. And then I said,

11:21.539 --> 11:25.185
there's just one thing. If you take that job at the 
OU, don't you ever allow OU and A&M to play

11:25.225 --> 11:35.741
football.

11:38.686 --> 11:40.990
That was our conversation about that. And sure 
enough, now they play all the time. And that is just

11:44.630 --> 11:47.174
terrible for me. You're torn. Yeah. Well, I'm not 
too torn. But when I went to Texas, that was kind of a

11:53.464 --> 12:02.938
tough thing for me, too. I tried to make all the 
dances at OU. But the train went to Bryan. I mean, to

12:12.558 --> 12:13.720
Hearn. Remember, is Hearn still there? Yes, 
ma'am. They'd meet me up there at Hearn, and I'd get

12:17.124 --> 12:34.046
off the train and spend the weekend and go to the 
core dance on Saturday night and go back to... And

12:17.124 --> 12:34.046
in spite of all that, I had some friends down at 
Texas A&M. I joined a sorority. I was a pi-fi down

12:36.470 --> 12:38.032
there. And...

12:41.532 --> 12:53.305
So there was a lot that was very nice about it, but it 
never, ever came anywhere close to taking any

12:41.532 --> 12:53.305
feeling that I didn't have for A&M. That was just, 
that was just, the spirit they talk about all the

12:54.346 --> 13:01.314
time really got into me. Don't

13:01.374 --> 13:05.838
you want some more pillows behind you? Well, thank 
you, Carolyn. I think you need propping up. Yeah.

13:11.821 --> 13:17.146
Well, I'm doing a lot of talking, but it's not 
anything that's going to help Dr. Martin. Is that

13:17.266 --> 13:17.787
better? Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. Make 
believe that I had never heard about this spirit.

13:23.652 --> 13:25.373
What was this Aggie spirit? I don't know, but it got 
into people mighty good. How? What caused people

13:30.538 --> 13:32.300
to be proud of it? Oh, I guess it was just everything 
was so close together and all just, all cadets and

13:41.860 --> 13:45.065
And not too much diversion. I don't know. I don't 
know what you call it. Were there some events that

13:48.570 --> 13:51.534
brought people together? That I recall. Did y'all 
have yell practices then? Yeah, sure. Where were

13:59.545 --> 14:00.406
they held? Well, sometimes they would come 
around. The whole student body would come and

14:07.396 --> 14:10.821
gather around the front porch at our house. And the 
father would come out there and he'd give them pep

14:15.170 --> 14:27.206
talk and they'd all cheer and yell and that kind of 
spirit. Did they ever attempt to play any tricks on

14:27.647 --> 14:34.576
your father, any pranks anywhere around the 
house? The students? Yes, ma'am.

14:41.463 --> 14:45.189
Well, I think that, I don't recall right now. You 
don't remember any trash on the front porch? No,

14:47.653 --> 14:49.536
nothing like that. They always seemed like they 
were very respectful.

14:56.468 --> 15:03.700
When you attended class, what did a young lady wear 
to class in those days? Oh, something just...

15:08.952 --> 15:11.235
tailored plain kind of clothes. You remind me, 
your answer reminds me of what Mrs. Walton told me

15:13.357 --> 15:28.054
she wore, so then to try to provoke your thoughts, 
you had faded blue jeans, sneakers. I can

15:29.676 --> 15:35.382
guarantee that I didn't wear anything like that. 
Would it have been a dress or a two-piece outfit?

15:39.583 --> 15:40.724
Oh, it would be a dress. What length? What skirt 
length? What was the hemline? Well, it was just a

15:46.310 --> 15:49.213
modest hemline. I don't know exactly because the 
hems change so much. And what kind of makeup would a

15:55.039 --> 16:02.466
coed have worn? Just about like what they're 
wearing now, if they don't put too much. And how

16:08.739 --> 16:12.825
long would a young lady's hair have been?

16:17.452 --> 16:22.940
You know, I was looking at some of the pictures of 
what they call senior favorites. What are you all

16:24.262 --> 16:26.104
showing around? Well, he just mentioned hemlines 
and hairdos. So it was okay for a young lady to cut

16:30.543 --> 16:33.827
her hair then? Oh, well, it was quite a big deal in my 
family about my hair because the girls were

16:33.887 --> 16:58.035
cutting the hair, and mine never did go real long, 
but it came down to about shoulder blade length,

16:33.887 --> 16:58.035
and I wanted to cut it, and my parents wouldn't let 
me. for a long time. And so on some birthday that I

17:01.083 --> 17:09.474
was having, my father was out of town. And I got a 
telegram from him. He said, you have my permission

17:14.260 --> 17:19.447
to cut your hair. So my mother made the 
appointment. And Carolyn, I think maybe it's a

17:22.491 --> 17:27.718
little cool in here.

17:29.656 --> 17:45.877
She made an appointment at this beauty shop down 
there and took me to Houston and had my hair cut and I

17:29.656 --> 17:45.877
still have the hair upstairs. They

17:46.819 --> 17:53.267
took my hair and just made it into a kind of a roll 
sort of thing, about this long. And that was the

18:00.298 --> 18:04.810
time when they made hairnets out of real hair. And 
they wanted to give my mother $25 for my hair, and

18:05.735 --> 18:11.101
she wouldn't take it. So it's still upstairs.

18:18.269 --> 18:22.554
But anyway, that's how, when I got my hair cut. I 
think I was 16, 17.

18:28.121 --> 18:29.262
This photo here. Oh, look. Is that in front of the 
president's house? Yeah. I remember that day we

18:35.771 --> 18:38.215
had that taken. I don't remember the day, but I 
remember. What was the occasion? Was that a

18:43.863 --> 18:45.004
birthday? No, I don't think so. Whose straw hat is 
that right there by the rocking chair? I don't have

18:52.134 --> 18:53.316
any idea. Is that yours?

18:56.596 --> 18:58.539
Well, I'm having a little trouble seeing it. Where 
is the hat? Right back there. Oh, down here. I don't

19:03.628 --> 19:06.592
know. Would a young lady have worn a straw hat 
often? Was it popular? Well, we wore hats. Yeah, we

19:14.385 --> 19:15.567
did.

19:18.078 --> 19:20.420
And is that your pet dog? That's Bill. I was dating a 
boy named Bill at that time, and when I got that

19:22.843 --> 19:31.171
little puppy, I just named him Bill. And I brought, 
it seems to me like I brought Bill to Norman with me.

19:36.497 --> 19:40.681
And he lived there in the house and around the 
house? Oh, yeah. I always had a dog, and nearly

19:41.842 --> 19:45.806
always a Spitz dog. I don't know how that happened. 
Did the dogs play around on the campus? I think so.

19:52.548 --> 19:58.034
That's

19:52.548 --> 19:58.034
the porch to the house. I think the steps are right 
close around here somewhere.

20:07.506 --> 20:13.813
While your dad was president of A&M, what were his 
greatest concerns? What was he hoping...

20:19.064 --> 20:20.647
to do at A&M?

20:23.853 --> 20:26.278
Well, I hardly know how to answer that. He was just 
great on getting everybody educated. He was...

20:30.506 --> 20:37.860
Did he have any pet subjects that he liked better 
than others? Well, after he retired, He taught a

20:42.723 --> 20:49.490
course in sociology, I think, and he enjoyed doing 
that. He would have been a good teacher. But, like,

20:51.853 --> 20:58.580
did he favor agriculture, or did he favor 
engineering? Well, where's Ralph?

21:04.247 --> 21:07.690
Where is that book that he wrote on agriculture? 
He's...

21:13.823 --> 21:18.609
And the top one, The Green Rising, is the book on 
agricultural economics. Yes, yes. So

21:21.533 --> 21:31.426
your dad then, his agriculture would have been his 
background. Were there any worries that he had

21:33.448 --> 21:42.700
about A&M being changed by somebody else? Were 
there any crises over? Not that I recall.

21:50.911 --> 21:59.124
As

21:50.911 --> 21:59.124
the First World War comes along, how did that 
affect A&M? Well, I believe, if I remember

21:59.925 --> 22:12.484
correctly, that they offered the country, you 
know, the government, the chance to use all the

22:13.443 --> 22:29.585
facilities down there I think they did for 
training and and

22:13.443 --> 22:29.585
it was it made a name for itself during the war. Did a 
lot of the of the students go away like we saw in

22:30.126 --> 22:35.453
World War II? The enrollment gets smaller? I just 
can't answer things like that because I just don't

22:40.443 --> 22:44.669
remember that.

22:52.040 --> 22:57.549
As you were getting ready to finish high school, 
were there World War II veterans coming back to the

22:52.040 --> 22:57.549
campus?

23:01.274 --> 23:02.496
That I don't know either. Let's see, some students 
that were very special to A&M and to the state of

23:07.865 --> 23:19.096
Texas and beyond that were there just about the 
time you took your first year of A&M study. One was

23:20.017 --> 23:20.898
M.T. Harrington, who graduated in the spring of 
22. Do you remember him? That was this book right

23:25.263 --> 23:26.824
here. He would be in that book. See, that's my 
brother's year, too. And, yes, I remember him. Can

23:35.405 --> 23:37.868
you tell me what you recall about him? I can't. I 
just remember mainly for his name, but that is a

23:39.150 --> 23:43.896
familiar name. He was from Plano and would later 
become a great chemistry teacher, president, and

23:44.056 --> 23:50.625
chancellor. His widow is still living, and she and 
Joe are in the same PEO chapter. Oh, is that right?

23:56.773 --> 23:58.135
Well, good, huh? Let's see. Do you remember a man 
named, a year before Dr. Harrington, H.B. Zachary

24:03.522 --> 24:05.204
from San Antonio? No. Well, Uvalde then, but then 
Santa. I don't believe I remember. He would create

24:10.575 --> 24:16.742
one of the huge engineering construction, 
highway construction firms. And his son is still

24:16.762 --> 24:19.064
running it today. Then a character, a beloved 
artist named Buck Shewitz. Oh, boy, I was hoping

24:29.055 --> 24:30.437
you... Because in the yearbook, they describe him 
as the Curio from Cuero. No, I don't recall him at

24:38.187 --> 24:40.190
all. Then the last one would be Sterling Evans. Mr. 
Evans is 100 years old. It was last August, and I

24:49.422 --> 25:00.778
interviewed him, and he was a key influence at the 
time of coeducation, non-compulsory core, and so

24:49.422 --> 25:00.778
forth. Was there any argument about making major 
changes at A&M to admit women?

25:12.950 --> 25:20.338
The only thing that I can remember about admitting 
women was I just thought it was the worst idea I'd

25:12.950 --> 25:20.338
ever heard in my life. It was going to ruin the 
school and all that I'd ever known about it. I was

25:25.904 --> 25:29.128
letting people do like it. That was your opinion? 
That was my opinion. But you attended there two

25:34.372 --> 25:35.954
years. I know. I know. And you liked it. I sure did. 
But I felt like it was just going to delude all the

25:41.480 --> 25:46.406
military. And the military to me, all the, 
everything about the military, the uniforms and

25:46.887 --> 25:55.977
the the polished boots and the shiny ornaments and 
the way they kept everything. And every

26:04.577 --> 26:15.552
afternoon at dinner time, the retreat.

26:17.715 --> 26:22.622
You know, I've got all this in my mind that's not 
like yours at all. Because there was this big, long

26:23.243 --> 26:28.548
military drive, they call it. Went from Speza Hall 
down to Guyon Hall. And that whole area would be,

26:35.114 --> 26:45.063
each company would have its own captain and all the 
officers lined up every evening. And people would

26:46.405 --> 26:50.989
come in their cars just to watch retreat. And 
they'd lower the flag and Star Spangled Banner And

26:55.846 --> 27:03.317
you know, it was all impressive, and then giving 
all the orders, and they all marched into the mess

26:55.846 --> 27:03.317
hall. And that just, all just appealed to me. I 
loved every bit of that. Did a young lady like you

27:10.008 --> 27:13.613
ever go out there and watch that retreat? Well, I 
saw it every day, because it was so close

27:13.994 --> 27:19.943
to our house. Did you and your family eat in the 
dining hall very often? In Sabisa Dining Hall? No.

27:27.182 --> 27:28.783
Did you know Mr. Sabisa? Yes. Please tell us all you 
can remember about him. I can't do that. I can't do

27:34.570 --> 27:37.293
that because it's not all good. Oh, really? That I 
remember. Well, tell us what you can that's good.

27:42.719 --> 27:46.103
Well, I'll tell you what it was good that he did. And 
that was on Sunday nights. They would bake this

27:49.016 --> 27:56.405
bread that was just that homemade bread out of this 
wonderful. And then he would slice it down the

27:57.186 --> 28:09.863
middle, take out some of the inside and fill it with 
broiled oysters and put the top down and bring it

27:57.186 --> 28:09.863
over for our Sunday supper. Not all the time, you 
know, just every now and then. And it was just

28:13.007 --> 28:14.408
wonderful. So I remember, that is the good thing I 
remember about Mr. Spears. Describe him

28:20.756 --> 28:22.078
physically. Was he a big man, a little man? No, he 
was kind of a little man. He had a little white

28:25.141 --> 28:26.563
goatee. Did he sound Germanic? Did he seem to have a 
German accent still? I think he had an accent.

28:35.534 --> 28:38.297
Because as I recall, he had been on the... the chef 
staff for the emperor of Austria-Hungary before

28:39.037 --> 28:45.987
coming to the United States. I'm not surprised, 
yeah. Was he stern? No. I don't know. He just

28:54.079 --> 28:55.420
wasn't. All right. Back to Dean Kyle. Describe him 
physically. Well, he was tall and slender.

29:04.834 --> 29:05.635
Pleasant? Yeah, yeah. She was too. Now, were the 
Kyles, did your family and the Kyles, were those

29:10.585 --> 29:17.346
the closest friends? They tried not to have the 
closest friends with the faculty people. I mean,

29:25.239 --> 29:28.262
they didn't want to pick stuff. They just liked 
them all. And of course, my mother and father had

29:30.625 --> 29:38.272
these faculty receptions and had everybody.

29:40.875 --> 29:46.641
But they didn't have this real close intimate 
friends. They tried not to. They would pick and

29:49.285 --> 29:57.056
choose, but now that I say that, I think that's the 
way my mother felt. There was, I don't know, one of

29:57.277 --> 30:02.885
her good friends there was Ms. Youngblood. Her 
husband was on faculty. And, you know, the

30:06.310 --> 30:11.017
Waltons, you mentioned their name. I've just been 
thinking about the Waltons because they were Do

30:16.473 --> 30:19.437
you know anything about the Waltons from Texas 
A&M? Why don't you sit up, and then we've got to get

30:19.457 --> 30:22.281
you propped up. Oh, I'm doing fine. Are you OK? 
Yeah. Yeah.

30:29.270 --> 30:30.932
Reminisce about the Waltons, please. Well, they 
had a daughter, Ethel Walton, and she was a

30:32.334 --> 30:38.982
contemporary of mine. She was there on the campus. 
I don't know whether she ever went to school there

30:41.448 --> 30:44.793
any night. I don't remember that. When

30:48.119 --> 31:00.940
your father wanted to relax, what did he do for fun, 
relaxation? Got himself a book and sat down and

31:01.180 --> 31:03.845
read. He read all the time. What were his favorite 
books? uh topics to read about oh was it fiction or

31:07.857 --> 31:28.752
no no not much fiction he had a very large library 
and

31:07.857 --> 31:28.752
among his other books he had a i think it was 600 
volumes Bible collection that he had bought all

31:30.233 --> 31:33.578
over Europe. And the library down at Norman is 
named for him, Brazil Memorial Library. And they

31:44.072 --> 31:47.577
have a nice room there. The family donated the 
collection. Oh, how nice. But all through the

31:53.521 --> 31:57.114
years, he collected those. He had some very rare, 
rare Bibles.
