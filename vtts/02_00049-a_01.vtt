WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:08.219
how it works, hoping that everything goes well. 
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:12.826 --> 00:24.642
We're April the 2nd, up at Camp Creek, looking out 
over the lake, chatting with Ed Cooper, and now

00:12.826 --> 00:24.642
want to stop and be sure this machine is working.

00:27.927 --> 00:32.333
Ed, would you, since we may not get your student 
days done today, Hope we can. Would you give a brief

00:33.975 --> 00:45.815
summary of your experience before you came to work 
on the campus with Mr. Rutter and President

00:33.975 --> 00:45.815
Williams? Concentrating on A&M experience, is 
that what you mean? Yes. OK. My major in college was

00:50.022 --> 00:57.375
the field of wildlife conservation.

00:57.946 --> 01:05.556
I developed a great interest in that field as a 
young man growing up in a natural situation in San

00:57.946 --> 01:05.556
Marcos. Decided to major in wildlife and A&M was 
the only and still is the only university in the

01:06.297 --> 01:15.810
state that offers a degree program in wildlife 
management. So with that in mind and not with any

01:16.572 --> 01:24.983
idea at all about what employment I would get into 
per se except that it would probably be with Parks

01:25.756 --> 01:30.601
and Wildlife or Fish and Wildlife or Forest 
Service or National Parks. I went into the field,

01:31.362 --> 01:34.145
enjoyed it very, very much. I was a good student in 
wildlife. And I made friends with Ari Callender,

01:37.648 --> 01:42.433
who was the Ag Extension Service Wildlife 
Specialist. He was the first one they had in all of

01:42.453 --> 01:45.997
agriculture. And when I left to serve two years 
with the 2nd Armored Division in Germany, Mr.

01:47.218 --> 01:53.485
Callender wrote me. several times and said do not 
accept a job anywhere until you've given us a

01:54.308 --> 02:15.608
chance an extension because i'm going to retire so 
honoring that i went to the campus had already had

01:54.308 --> 02:15.608
an offer from parks and wildlife to be a public 
information officer at rockport uh at a very low

01:54.308 --> 02:15.608
salary by the way And I liked very much when I 
interviewed Nolan Williamson and Hoot Gibson

02:16.398 --> 02:23.369
with the Ag Extension. I was really impressed with 
the people and their attitude about work. And I

02:29.399 --> 02:32.664
said, you know, I believe I'll go to work with you 
guys. They said, we want to start you as an

02:33.706 --> 02:42.861
assistant county agent so you understand 4-H 
programs and how the county extension people

02:33.706 --> 02:42.861
operate in the counties. We'll put you with Elmo V. 
Cook, one of our best county agents in Austin,

02:43.364 --> 02:47.328
Texas. There'll be little towns and big towns, so 
you get a cross-section of agriculture there

02:48.970 --> 02:55.917
until Mr. Callender retires. He retired in six 
months. So in about middle of 1956, I came to

02:58.719 --> 03:12.173
campus, served seven years as ag extension 
specialist in wildlife conservation, was in the

02:58.719 --> 03:12.173
field about 50% of the time, and had more gates 
opened and more doors open to meeting the good

03:12.406 --> 03:24.118
people across the state of Texas than all of the 
rest of my experiences put together because

03:12.406 --> 03:24.118
that's the nature of that business. I still have 
friends in counties across the state because of

03:25.360 --> 03:30.465
extension work. So I guess my best experience was 
the communications with people, primarily in

03:30.485 --> 03:38.734
agriculture. I thoroughly enjoyed those seven 
years as wildlife specialist. My territory was

03:43.619 --> 03:48.005
simply the state of Texas. I wrote a newsletter to 
all the county extension agents with as much

03:48.025 --> 03:52.091
up-to-date information. I told them back in the 
50s that we would see a time, for example, when the

03:52.972 --> 04:03.186
leasing of property for hunting would be super big 
business, and they guffawed and said, how in the

04:03.773 --> 04:12.345
hell can it be when all they do is let their friends 
and their family hunt? And now without hunting in

04:12.865 --> 04:17.792
the hill country, for example, most ranchers 
would be out of business. So what I predicted did

04:18.673 --> 04:27.625
happen because I knew of people's intense desire 
to be outdoors and away from the stress of life. So

04:27.645 --> 04:28.887
with that background, I decided to get rich and 
joined a classmate in Jacksonville, Texas, in

04:29.761 --> 04:39.252
agricultural fertilizer and limestone 
business. We had the trucks to spread them. We were

04:40.774 --> 04:41.715
going to get rich. My arrival in Jacksonville 
coincided with the worst drought they've ever had

04:42.536 --> 04:53.109
there, and people simply stopped spending money 
on something that would burn the pastures even

04:42.536 --> 04:53.109
worse than the sun. And so I could see the 
handwriting on the wall. Got a call in from Clark

04:56.828 --> 05:00.273
Monroe, personnel director. And John Hutchison, 
ag extension director, had given my name as a

05:01.114 --> 05:09.226
candidate possibly for assistant to President 
Earl Rutter. And he arranged an interview. I

05:11.670 --> 05:13.613
walked into Mr. Rutter's office. And he said, 
Cooper, I understand you sell ag limestone. He

05:18.280 --> 05:22.305
said, I've got a ranch out close to London, Texas. 
You know where that is? I said, I sure do. He said,

05:25.567 --> 05:28.191
how much lime should I use on that ranch? And I said, 
well, President Rutter, since it's entirely made

05:28.231 --> 05:35.020
of limestone already, I really don't see you 
wasting money on that. And he just died laughing.

05:36.281 --> 05:46.375
And I think that simple little off to a good start 
thing convinced him that I might be a type of

05:36.281 --> 05:46.375
personality that he could use in that office. And 
so in 63, October of 63, I started as his

05:46.395 --> 05:53.785
administrative assistant. replacing Dorsey 
Macquarie, who went over and, as you know,

05:54.254 --> 06:00.283
developed the development office. And it had tied 
in with student financial aid as well with Bob

06:00.303 --> 06:05.030
Logan. I'm not going to ask this question of any 
other. What was the beginning salary as Mr.

06:08.956 --> 06:13.322
Rutter's assistant? The Extension Service had a 
PhD in soil science at that time, just as I left,

06:14.484 --> 06:23.417
which was only nine months before this. And he 
passed the benchmark of $10,000 in salary for the

06:23.903 --> 06:31.854
first extension specialist that had ever made 
$10,000. And so I was flattered to come back at that

06:31.874 --> 06:37.442
salary, $10,000. And at that time, we were in a 
pretty bad situation because the job in

06:37.462 --> 06:46.675
Jacksonville just did not pan out. So it was a 
lifesaver for us.

06:52.523 --> 07:00.364
Mr. Rutter, I learned, was really close with state 
money. And if he thought he could get a guy 10, and

07:02.918 --> 07:07.584
instead of 12 or 13, he'd damn sure go for 10. He was 
very close. And then later I worked with Jack

07:09.526 --> 07:13.531
Williams, which we'll get to, but he was the other 
way. If he had a person he wanted, he'd pay whatever

07:13.831 --> 07:16.354
it took. Rudder would do his best to get it at rock 
bottom. And I think that's one reason you saw a lot

07:20.078 --> 07:28.889
of retired military people on campus, because 
they already had an income, and he could get them

07:20.078 --> 07:28.889
for bargain rates. I can't fuss about it, but he was 
damn tight. Describe Earl Rudder as you came to

07:32.298 --> 07:39.589
know him at those first years. What was he like, 
physically, emotionally, attitudinally, and so

07:40.009 --> 07:47.561
forth?

07:47.581 --> 07:55.713
He was a laid-back kind of an individual around the 
office. He was fairly moody. And when I was his

08:03.112 --> 08:08.558
assistant, it was my habit to go in in the morning 
and I would have two Manila folders. And I'd call

08:09.840 --> 08:12.383
them the happy file and the sad file. And if I could 
see that far away look in his gray, steel gray eyes

08:13.845 --> 08:23.476
that something was really nagging at him, I would 
never get into that sad file. Because whatever I

08:23.836 --> 08:28.782
proposed would be thumbs down. So I'd go to the 
happy file and talk about easy things that we were

08:29.335 --> 08:36.324
going to do that wouldn't require any thought. But 
I could read him pretty well. He had a look about his

08:37.866 --> 08:39.828
face. He was always signing papers, and very often 
while I'd visit with him in the mornings, he would

08:41.250 --> 08:48.980
continue signing papers. And he developed a 
system where he wouldn't sign it, wouldn't sign

08:49.841 --> 08:56.710
anything unless it had initials from whatever 
vice president was responsible in that area. He

09:00.576 --> 09:07.986
got where he would not ask any questions if he saw 
Tom Cherry's signature or Clyde Freeman or

09:00.576 --> 09:07.986
whoever. But he wouldn't sign it without him. So he 
could sign papers and think at the same time. But I

09:13.633 --> 09:16.477
could read his moods very easily. And he was easy to 
get along with. Very seldom was he ever short, if he

09:23.690 --> 09:32.858
was really mad about something, he would just 
simply turn gray and shut up and not say anything.

09:33.019 --> 09:34.400
Jack Williams was not that way. What were Mr. 
Rudder's pet peeves, if he had any?

09:44.709 --> 09:50.895
This sounds silly, but I was close to him, and he 
disliked people that smoked pipes. He said,

09:51.635 --> 10:01.168
anybody that has enough time to keep a damn pipe 
clean enough to smoke is not doing his job. Another

10:01.188 --> 10:09.199
thing that he was very conservative in terms of the 
way people dressed. He thought people should be

10:09.439 --> 10:12.924
dressed properly for their work or their job. He 
did not, for example, allow his daughters to wear

10:14.265 --> 10:21.355
shorts at home.

10:21.588 --> 10:30.716
He thought that parents should control most of the 
activities of their children who they had dates

10:21.588 --> 10:30.716
with and who they did not have dates with. And he 
was, as I mentioned earlier, very close with

10:31.957 --> 10:36.461
money. Ms. Rutter told Peggy and I a number of times 
that he damn sure didn't give her enough money to

10:36.861 --> 10:43.987
run that house, that household. And that was true. 
But he was just, you know, he came from the land

10:45.769 --> 10:50.953
office and he had an experience of what happens 
when people lose respect for money and honesty.

10:55.991 --> 11:02.579
And so he was just going to be very certain that 
everything he did was only up and up and expected

10:55.991 --> 11:02.579
the people that worked for him to be the same way. He 
reveled in telling stories, certainly about his

11:03.921 --> 11:13.754
experiences in the Army and the Normandy 
invasion. And

11:13.874 --> 11:20.923
if he would have a drink or two, he would invariably 
start talking about about his experiences in the

11:22.135 --> 11:24.358
military. And I've heard the names, I think at 
least once of every Ranger that served under him as

11:24.998 --> 11:45.483
they, and the cooperation they got with the 
British, he had a steel trap memory and he could

11:24.998 --> 11:45.483
remember what they ate the night before the 
invasion and, uh, which one's got seasick and

11:24.998 --> 11:45.483
things like that. Steel, steel memory, steel trap 
memory about things like that. And that war. never

11:53.219 --> 11:56.604
really was over in his mind. And until the day he 
died, and this might be edited out, but he still

11:58.046 --> 12:08.059
doesn't trust Germans until the day he died. And he 
would try not to say anything, but when somebody

12:09.000 --> 12:22.939
had the name Levi Strom or Schaffner, he was 
automatically suspicious because he had such a

12:09.000 --> 12:22.939
bad experience over there with the Germans. He 
admired them because they were good, but he

12:23.375 --> 12:29.684
detested them at the same time. I think he would 
have felt the same way about the Japanese.

12:34.030 --> 12:37.736
Physically, he was not quite as trim as that statue 
is. Physically, okay, a basic point. He had no

12:45.587 --> 12:53.078
interest in this world other than devoting his 
life to Texas A&M. In so doing, most of it is

12:53.918 --> 12:57.204
sedentary. What is that the right word? 
Sedentary. Sedentary. You can do it sitting down

13:00.169 --> 13:04.897
and very often at banquet tables. He loved to drink 
and often it was the wrong kind of thing for a man

13:04.918 --> 13:13.092
that had his feed conversion ratio. He liked 
Harvey Wallbangers, for example, which was a

13:17.153 --> 13:23.639
terrible syrupy kind of a drink. That's the last 
thing he needed. But he loved to have a few

13:25.281 --> 13:28.064
cocktails before his meals. And that would give 
him more of an appetite. And he really had no

13:31.327 --> 13:33.129
exercise. And I think all of that together, the 
stress of the job, overweight, and no exercise and

13:40.409 --> 13:47.057
absolutely no outside interest. He tried to go 
quail hunting over on the Heap Ranch with me. He'd

13:50.541 --> 13:52.824
walk around for an hour or so and said, when are we 
going to eat? He tried to go fishing, but he was the

13:54.285 --> 13:58.971
poorest coordinated man with a rod and reel I've 
ever seen. It would wrap around his head and go up

13:59.011 --> 14:02.054
into the trees. And he just couldn't find anything 
to get his mind off of his job. And I think with the

14:06.760 --> 14:09.403
combination of stress blood pressure, eating, 
and the drinking that creates an appetite that

14:09.940 --> 14:17.828
goes with it. All of those things, I think, killed 
him at an early age. And he had no avocation, did he?

14:23.093 --> 14:23.153
No. No hobbies? No. None. Let's see. My brain just 
thinks of this. Let's reach back. Did you ever hear

14:30.219 --> 14:39.188
from him any explanation as to how or why Alan 
Shivers called on Earl Rudder to come clean up the

14:39.455 --> 14:41.377
land office.

14:44.601 --> 14:47.664
He had been Lyndon Johnson's campaign manager, so 
I understand. West Texas, that's right. It had to

14:51.048 --> 14:56.574
be smoky

14:51.048 --> 14:56.574
room politics.

15:01.159 --> 15:08.567
And there's a whole lot of friendship behind the 
scenes that went on in and around Austin. that I got

15:09.610 --> 15:12.553
really mainly from Margaret Rutter. But they were 
real close to some people high in state politics

15:13.994 --> 15:19.059
through the years. And I don't recall 
specifically the Shivers tie-in. I heard a lot

15:25.225 --> 15:33.973
about Jake Pickle and John Connolly and Lyndon 
Johnson and all of those. But I don't remember much

15:34.053 --> 15:36.736
about Shivers. Because I think it was Shivers that 
brought him over. to head the land office. I

15:40.719 --> 15:41.741
believe it was, yeah. All right, then did you ever 
hear how did the A&M leadership come to identify

15:41.761 --> 15:54.098
Earl Rudder to come over here in the late 50s and 
take charge? Well, now that was John Connolly,

15:56.361 --> 15:57.803
wasn't it? Well, Connolly wasn't yet governor. 
No, wait a minute. Because see, Connolly doesn't

16:01.408 --> 16:04.092
become governor until 62. That's true. And Rutter 
came, I think, in 57 and was a vice president.

16:10.640 --> 16:10.900
Right. And as I have understood it, the plan was 
clear cut. You come and do this for a year or so, and

16:16.147 --> 16:19.672
then you become president. And his inauguration 
is the spring of 1960, because I was in the

16:20.553 --> 16:30.867
procession representing my undergraduate 
school, Austin College. And so he officially

16:31.285 --> 16:37.873
becomes president in 59, and the ceremony is held 
in early 60. Right. I really can't contribute to

16:39.335 --> 16:42.959
that era. He never really talked about that to me. 
So that early age, really nearly everything,

16:47.605 --> 16:57.377
seeing I was in ag extension, and really 
everything that I knew about him he either talked

16:58.167 --> 17:07.216
about, and usually with me that was back to the war, 
was

16:58.167 --> 17:07.216
me from 63 on. When you got there, describe his 
staff, the office group. Dorsey McCrory had been

17:15.605 --> 17:18.387
his assistant. And back to the conservative 
nature, Dorsey was a retired colonel in the Army.

17:28.458 --> 17:38.549
I was assured by Clark Monroe that Dorsey would sit 
down with me at length and tell me how to be an

17:28.458 --> 17:38.549
assistant to President Errol Rudder. And 
Dorsey's total training for me was, oh, you'll

17:38.809 --> 17:42.293
catch on. That was it. He refused to talk about it 
anymore. And let's see, the people in the office

17:47.398 --> 17:58.110
then, we didn't have NELDA that early.

18:00.520 --> 18:04.767
He had an executive committee that would meet on 
Mondays, and I went to those meetings. And who was

18:04.787 --> 18:05.708
on that? Oh, there'd be... The deans and the vice 
presidents? Yeah, that's right, the deans and the

18:08.733 --> 18:12.779
vice presidents, and the directors. Ah, yes. 
Because at that time, they reported, the service

18:13.520 --> 18:17.806
directors reported them. And those were really 
good meetings, frank and open discussions,

18:18.447 --> 18:24.617
arguments. Fred Benson, of course, was... 
leading the pack, he had the most respect, I would

18:28.111 --> 18:31.535
say. He was very wary about things that came from 
the system level. Of course, there was bad

18:38.143 --> 18:40.927
feelings there. Can I talk about people? Oh, yes. 
Oh, yes, please. He said something like, you know,

18:47.094 --> 18:52.360
I can't stand Clyde Freeman. I don't like him. But 
he has never made a mistake. that he's brought to

18:58.216 --> 18:59.197
me. He has been right about everything that's ever 
come to me that he's had to interpret for me. J.A.

19:07.288 --> 19:16.520
Amos was the total legislative staff, which would 
be Beatle Bailey compared to the entire WW2 now

19:07.288 --> 19:16.520
with what they have. You said legislative. You 
meant legal. Excuse me. I meant the total legal

19:19.664 --> 19:22.708
staff with J.A. Amos. And that was down the hall, of 
course. But I'm trying to think of Jerry Haught.

19:31.976 --> 19:38.647
Jerry Haught was the main administrative 
secretary for him. It was really a very small

19:40.009 --> 19:41.972
staff. Now, you all were in the System building or 
the Koch building? Started in System and then went

19:46.258 --> 19:49.744
to Koch. And I'll never forget, I had the air 
conditioning was very bad in that building. Well,

19:57.060 --> 20:01.344
the whole building was designed poorly. It was the 
worst building I think I've ever been in, except

20:01.364 --> 20:05.948
Guyon Hall. But I said, Mr. Rutter, could I have? I 
was on the west side. Would it be OK for me to get some

20:12.914 --> 20:21.042
drapes in here to help cut the sunlight down? All we 
had was Venetian blinds. He said, no. He said,

20:23.820 --> 20:28.006
first thing, you know every assistant on campus 
would want that. And the rule was there'd be no

20:28.026 --> 20:31.470
carpets and no drapes. And then one August 
afternoon, he came into my office. And he says, my

20:37.738 --> 20:39.841
god, Cook River's hot in here. He said, why don't 
you get some drapes for those?

20:45.048 --> 20:46.369
That was one of his little quirks. He would come in, 
and something that you had mentioned to him before

20:46.450 --> 20:52.918
as an idea, You'd think he had dismissed it. But a 
week or so later, he would come back and say, why

20:55.961 --> 21:00.327
don't you look into this? I'll never forget, 
Ergolic

21:00.647 --> 21:09.598
in chemistry was the soccer coach for A&M. And he 
said, we need a new soccer field. They quit letting

21:14.084 --> 21:18.049
them play on the drill field. And Mr. Rudder said, 
Edwin, I want you to find Professor O'Gallick, a

21:20.928 --> 21:25.395
place for the soccer field. And I came down to one 
place where the floral test garden is, right in

21:26.577 --> 21:32.125
there. Nice slope, close to the gym, showers, 
everything. And I brought a map in, and I showed it

21:36.251 --> 21:38.234
to Mr. O'Gallick. I said, this is the place. This is 
it. He said, what is that symbol there, right in the

21:40.678 --> 21:44.403
middle of that field? I said, oh, it's that big, 
old, ugly mesquite tree. there's a mesquite tree

21:48.232 --> 21:50.014
in the middle of that field. He said, you find 
something else. I said, sir, it's a mesquite. He

21:53.478 --> 21:58.303
said, have you ever been to Eden, Texas? He says, 
now that's all we had. He said, I love mesquite

22:01.347 --> 22:02.908
trees. And later, when they were designing the 
president's home, he changed the whole driveway

22:03.729 --> 22:13.260
so the big old mesquites that are there to this day 
would not be disturbed. But the point back to what I

22:13.280 --> 22:17.665
was saying a while ago about how it would come back 
to you, He came in about two weeks later and he says,

22:19.028 --> 22:23.614
have you found a place for the soccer team? I said, 
well, sir, the only place really that's within any

22:23.694 --> 22:29.241
kind of reason is the one I showed you. He said, 
where the mesquite tree is? I said, yes, sir. He

22:34.087 --> 22:38.212
said, OK, we've got a court trip this coming week. 
You tell Shorty Parsons that on Saturday night

22:39.053 --> 22:46.723
after dark that that tree be removed. And Sod put 
over it, I don't want anybody to know the tree is

22:47.615 --> 22:52.900
gone. He said, that'll be where our shark will 
fill. He said, I'm surprised you didn't come up

22:55.163 --> 23:00.308
with that sooner.

23:00.328 --> 23:05.894
But he had a great feeling for outdoor things. And 
on the location of the house, I'll also remember

23:05.914 --> 23:11.900
about the tree. You brought that to mind.

23:15.779 --> 23:19.022
I said one time, why are you facing that house due 
east? He said, because the sun is going to shine on

23:20.663 --> 23:26.489
Texas A&M every day, and I want to be the first one to 
see it. That's good. Let's go back to that Monday

23:29.611 --> 23:35.036
morning executive committee. He inherited some 
of those folks, but he had an influence on some of

23:37.118 --> 23:43.084
the others. One was Frank Hubert. Do you have any 
idea of the relation? Did the Huberts and Rudders

23:48.262 --> 23:52.448
have an old Austin relation, or do you know?

23:56.194 --> 24:00.340
Possibly so, through the Texas Education Agency 
type of setup. But I've never heard that

24:00.380 --> 24:05.147
specifically discussed. When Hubert said 
something, did he listen? Did Rudder listen, like

24:08.332 --> 24:11.757
I know he did when Benson Yes, and Frank, I think he 
did because he had the same habit that he had on

24:12.968 --> 24:22.141
academic council. Not academic council. APC. 
APC. Which I admired. He would listen to all the

24:28.229 --> 24:38.784
arguments and not say a word until he had it in his 
mind that the best route would be, and then he would

24:28.229 --> 24:38.784
speak up at the end. And I think Mr. Rudder...

24:43.192 --> 24:44.294
appreciated that. Uh, Benson, you didn't have to 
say anything. You read him, read his face. Uh, I

24:53.747 --> 24:58.434
remember one of the things that he challenged the 
deans with. He says, Now we committed after the

24:58.474 --> 25:04.342
report that you were involved in, we're committed 
to excellence. We're not gonna have that unless we

25:05.163 --> 25:07.647
have some really world-renowned type of faculty 
and administrators here and he really pressed

25:08.605 --> 25:38.207
them to to find people and I remember Romanek was 
one of the really early ones and turned out to be an

25:08.605 --> 25:38.207
interesting choice but he was one and then later 
the man that was the National Academy of Science I

25:08.605 --> 25:38.207
can't remember his name precisely then Horace 
Byers but all of this started with Rudder's

25:08.605 --> 25:38.207
admonition I want some bell ringers in here we've 
got to have them. And if we get those, we can get the

25:41.831 --> 25:47.461
money that we need for research that you guys keep 
pounding about. And another thing that he was

25:49.084 --> 25:54.694
adamant about is never losing track of how 
important undergraduate teaching was. I think

25:59.038 --> 26:11.330
one of his peeves was that faculty people, and 
deans included, probably were putting too much

25:59.038 --> 26:11.330
stress on the research aspect over the classroom 
teaching. I don't think he was not opposed to

26:11.811 --> 26:24.263
research, but he was opposed to people losing 
track of how important it was that we have fine

26:11.811 --> 26:24.263
classroom teaching at the undergraduate level. 
That was a pet peeve of his. He

26:26.922 --> 26:34.591
did not like social climbers. We're back to his 
personality traits now. But you could see that at

26:39.077 --> 26:49.129
the dean's meetings and everywhere we would meet 
and talk. He was more interested in seeing a

26:49.149 --> 26:55.377
person's results than he was idle chatter about 
it. He laid great strength in knowing people, and I

26:56.082 --> 27:22.870
think the thing that I remember the best about him 
was he said, Edwin, you're going to have in your

26:56.082 --> 27:22.870
future life people that you work with or that work 
for you, and they're going to be disappointing to

26:56.082 --> 27:22.870
you, and they're going to screw up some things or 
cause problems. He said, I think the best thing to

27:23.450 --> 27:25.212
do whether it's education, business, or 
elsewhere. When you get somebody new in there,

27:29.309 --> 27:36.400
maybe somebody you didn't even hire, but you have 
to work with them, find out what they do well. And

27:38.664 --> 27:41.168
don't expect them to do anything besides that. 
Find out what they don't do well. Forget it. You're

27:44.594 --> 27:46.997
not going to change them. Find out what they do well 
and take advantage of that. And you'll be happy,

27:49.562 --> 27:51.705
and they'll be happy. And he kept saying that more 
than any other thing that I remember. Now, his

27:57.804 --> 28:00.787
chief financial officer when you got there was Tom 
Cherry? Right. And Clark Diebel. And what was

28:03.770 --> 28:05.212
their relationship? It was excellent, if you're 
asking for it. Tom was completely honest with him.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.085
He was not afraid to buck an idea. And he would argue 
points. And he'd had such good experience with

28:20.080 --> 28:23.544
the, what was it? He was with an airlines. Yeah, Pan 
American Airlines or something. He'd had a rich

28:30.892 --> 28:32.254
experience. And Mr. Rudder had the greatest 
confidence in him. And then Tom leaned very

28:38.601 --> 28:44.187
heavily on Clark Diebel. as the one to get the 
nitty-gritty work of the day done. And Tom was

28:49.017 --> 28:55.885
freed up to do a lot of thought about directions 
that we were moving fiscally and so forth. And Mr.

28:55.905 --> 28:58.888
Rutter had a high opinion of him. And he simply 
would not sign anything unless Tom Cherry's TDC

28:59.409 --> 29:04.935
was on there.

29:07.818 --> 29:09.280
Looking now for anecdotes. Can you recall any 
interesting situation where something fiscally

29:09.496 --> 29:25.078
went wrong or was about to go wrong and maybe 
somebody grabbed it, found it, discovered it?

29:29.344 --> 29:30.386
Let me think about that. As we go on, I'll think of 
one. Because there have to be where somebody comes

29:35.073 --> 29:38.878
in and, uh-oh, so-and-so is broke or, We're about 
to go over the budget, or we just found a

29:39.247 --> 29:45.357
mathematical error, and we got a million dollars 
more than we thought we had. There's got to be. OK,

29:46.619 --> 29:48.402
I'll think of something on that line. He and Diebel 
went back to the land office, and so they. That's

29:53.371 --> 29:55.634
the German that he trusted. OK, then in the student 
area, Hannigan was here as dean of students.

30:02.766 --> 30:03.848
Another retired general. Another retired 
general. who, to me, didn't always understand

30:05.453 --> 30:09.558
Texas A&M well. Did Mr. Rutter think that of 
Hannigan? I think Mr. Rutter

30:14.123 --> 30:34.127
knew that Hannigan was going to, in his own way,

30:14.123 --> 30:34.127
make conservative decisions, that he was not 
going to come up with some wild-eyed program that

30:14.123 --> 30:34.127
was going to cost a great deal of money. And the guys 
that worked for him were grossly underpaid. I

30:38.675 --> 30:40.637
found that out later. And the dean of students' job 
in Mr. Rudder's eyes was maintain law and order and

30:45.942 --> 31:01.216
good study conditions, break up water fights, cut 
out pornography, cut out the drinking in the

30:45.942 --> 31:01.216
dormitories, and make everybody pretty well toe 
the line, as if it were a military encampment. He

31:02.137 --> 31:04.519
never really was. sold, in my mind, on a lot of the 
really good extracurricular things that were

31:06.490 --> 31:17.306
taking place, like at the MSC Council. He never was 
really strong on that. Of course, the core was his

31:21.873 --> 31:27.621
love, but like the student leadership 
conferences.
