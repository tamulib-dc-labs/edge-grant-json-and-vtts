00:02.326 --> 00:09.874
This is January 25, sitting in the beautiful 
living room out at Pebble Creek with Glenn

00:02.326 --> 00:09.874
Johnson. Now, Glenn, check your mic. Okay, I'll 
check my mic and see if it's working okay.

00:18.623 --> 00:29.515
Glenn, for the sake of someone in years from now who 
might be listening to this or reading the

00:18.623 --> 00:29.515
transcript, would you summarize your experience 
and background, where'd you grow up, go to school,

00:29.984 --> 00:43.105
and particularly your experience academically 
before you began to think about moving to College

00:29.984 --> 00:43.105
Station, Texas. Sure. Well, I was born in 
Cleveland, Ohio, 1930. My mother and father were

00:48.674 --> 00:53.983
divorced when I was a baby, and so we moved to little 
community called Sebring, Ohio, about 65 miles

00:54.284 --> 01:00.513
southeast of Cleveland. And I spent my elementary 
and secondary years there in Sebring, at Sebring

01:01.414 --> 01:08.905
McKinley High School. I attended undergraduate 
school at Kent State University, 1949 to 1953. I

01:18.905 --> 01:26.314
had one year of teaching experience in a suburb of 
Cleveland, Euclid on Lake Erie. I had two years of

01:27.476 --> 01:39.030
military duty because I'd been in the ROTC, so I 
went into the military and fulfilled that

01:27.476 --> 01:39.030
obligation, the two-year obligation. When I came 
out of the service, it was in the middle of the

01:40.291 --> 01:44.997
summer, So I knew I would be going back to Euclid, 
Ohio, and I used that summer to start my master's

01:45.179 --> 01:58.918
program at Ohio State University where I finished 
a master of arts with a thesis.

02:01.862 --> 02:14.460
Later I became what was called a master teacher in 
Euclid, Ohio, then an assistant principal, and by

02:01.862 --> 02:14.460
that time I'd finished the master's and started my 
doctorate at Columbia University going summers.

02:18.384 --> 02:25.555
I was offered principal ships in Euclid and in a 
suburb of St. Louis, Missouri called Clayton,

02:18.384 --> 02:25.555
Missouri. And I opted for the principal ship in 
Clayton, Missouri and spent three years there

02:26.516 --> 02:36.090
going to Columbia University for six-week summer 
terms. And finally, my major professor said, it's

02:37.332 --> 02:43.401
time you must come into residence. So I did. I went 
into residence in 1966

02:44.622 --> 02:51.950
through that academic year, 66, 67. At the end of my 
residence, near the end of my residence, I was

02:54.013 --> 03:11.093
being interviewed for assistant 
superintendencies in upstate New York and a

02:54.013 --> 03:11.093
superintendency in a suburb of Chicago, 
Illinois. And I got this phone call out of the clear

03:11.680 --> 03:22.293
blue sky, knew nothing about it coming, from a Dr. 
Paul Hanseling at Texas A&M University. And he

03:23.675 --> 03:34.848
said that they had a new position for an assistant 
professor and that I seemed to have the

03:23.675 --> 03:34.848
credentials for that position. And I asked him how 
he knew me, how he got these credentials. and he

03:40.604 --> 04:07.860
said he had written to Columbia University and 
said this is what we're looking for and they sent me

03:40.604 --> 04:07.860
your credentials and we like what we see we'll pay 
to have you come down here for a couple of days and

03:40.604 --> 04:07.860
meet us and get acquainted with us and see if you 
would be interested so I talked to Ida I hadn't the

03:40.604 --> 04:07.860
foggiest idea where Texas A&M University was I'd 
heard of it primarily because of football more

04:08.347 --> 04:13.334
than anything else. I couldn't in my own mind while 
I was talking to Dr. Hentschling sort out if this

04:15.196 --> 04:28.694
was Texas Tech or Texas A&M or West Texas or East 
Texas or whatever. There were so many to people who

04:28.734 --> 04:34.742
had never been to Texas and I had never been to 
Texas. So I told Ida as we talked, you know, I've

04:35.650 --> 04:40.034
never been to Texas. This is an opportunity for me 
to at least go visit Texas, and I'll continue

04:40.255 --> 04:48.103
looking at these other jobs. So sure enough, I came 
down and really had not the inkling, no inkling at

04:49.284 --> 04:57.993
all, that I would end up staying here. But I liked 
what I saw. I thought it was a nice community. I had

05:04.359 --> 05:06.180
four very young children. This looked like a nice 
place after living in places like St. Louis,

05:07.190 --> 05:13.297
Missouri and New York City. They have four young 
children grow up. And I guess the key factor was

05:18.343 --> 05:30.057
when I finished my presentation to the faculty in 
the Department of Education in the College of

05:18.343 --> 05:30.057
Liberal Arts. And I finished interviewing with 
the key people, Bill Graves and Paul Hanserling.

05:37.885 --> 06:00.062
and they took me up to meet the dean of the college 
who was Frank W.R. Hubert and Frank Hubert painted

05:37.885 --> 06:00.062
for me what Texas A&M University is today and I had I 
had no idea as I looked at what I saw in 1967

06:01.409 --> 06:08.399
What we see today is, you know, it's just beyond 
your comprehension, and yet Frank Hubert saw

06:01.409 --> 06:08.399
this. And he was very strong in his support of 
President Earl Rudder. I believe I interviewed

06:17.632 --> 06:24.682
with, from there I think I interviewed with Byers, 
Vice President Byers, I believe. And my final

06:25.944 --> 06:31.332
stop, which really came as a total shock, because I 
never dreamed I'd go beyond the college dean. But

06:36.433 --> 06:37.134
there I was. I'd been with the vice president. Now 
they were taking me over to meet the president of

06:39.217 --> 06:45.204
this university, Earl Rudder. That just was 
beyond my comprehension. And Earl Rudder was a

06:49.629 --> 06:52.933
very gentle man. He was very courteous. He said he 
had heard good things about me. Hope that I like

06:59.510 --> 07:01.953
Texas A&M University. And so when that interview 
was over, I signaled to Paul Hensling and Bill

07:02.654 --> 07:14.149
Graves that I'd like a couple of days to go home and 
think about this. And they agreed to that. When I

07:16.512 --> 07:20.337
got home, I described the situation to my wife, 
Ida. and ask her if she thought we should go back and

07:21.548 --> 07:41.093
let her look at it she said no whatever i decided to 
do was going to be fine with her so i called paul and

07:21.548 --> 07:41.093
told him i would come and i've never regretted that 
move as far as you know They were not contrasting

07:41.613 --> 07:44.457
you with anyone else. They were looking at you, yes 
or no. To my knowledge, that's true. This 1967

07:49.083 --> 07:51.486
spring, fall, what? Spring. Spring of 67. Hoping 
for you to be here that fall. That fall. That's

07:56.533 --> 07:57.775
correct. What was the, and we're not going to talk 
money any other time, what was the beginning

07:57.835 --> 08:02.061
salary? Well, it was $12,400. For 12 months or not? 
That was for 12 months. That was one of their

08:08.710 --> 08:11.113
selling points, by the way. a lot of colleges and 
universities hire you only for nine months and

08:11.313 --> 08:36.527
then if they have the money they might negotiate 
either half summer or a full summer but Dr.

08:11.313 --> 08:36.527
Henseling made it clear and it was reinforced by 
Frank W.R. Hubert that what they were trying to do

08:11.313 --> 08:36.527
was to get people here 12 months so they were 
offering 12-month contracts Try to summarize for

08:37.081 --> 08:48.135
this preservation what description they gave you 
of the aspirations they had for education. Again,

08:49.777 --> 08:54.923
it was really Frank W.R. Hubert who painted this 
picture for me. He said he thought in the not too

08:54.983 --> 09:05.316
distant future that they would have a college of 
education at Texas A&M University. At the present

09:06.089 --> 09:13.040
time, at that time, they had just the Department of 
Education within the College of Liberal Arts. But

09:14.102 --> 09:28.705
he said that I believe their projected enrollment 
for the fall was going to be somewhere around 600

09:14.102 --> 09:28.705
ladies coming in to the programs at Texas A&M. 
which proved to be true. And that he saw nothing but

09:31.757 --> 09:42.830
tremendous growth because they had opened up 
recently to ladies coming into Texas A&M

09:31.757 --> 09:42.830
University. And with the demand for the growing 
number of children and the demand for more

09:43.611 --> 09:58.708
schools, public schools and so forth, he saw that 
growth taking Texas A&M to eventually a college of

09:43.611 --> 09:58.708
education. okay describe finding a place to live 
getting family here while I was here visiting Bill

09:59.920 --> 10:28.172
Graves did take me on a tour of the community and I 
guess the most startling thing that I saw was there

09:59.920 --> 10:28.172
just wasn't any restaurants to speak of I think we 
ate maybe at Tom's barbecue and there was an A&W

10:29.030 --> 10:49.637
root beer and they took me out to the Briarcrest 
Country Club for a meal and that's where they said

10:29.030 --> 10:49.637
that's pretty much it if you wanted a nice meal you 
usually went to Briarcrest Country Club they said

10:29.030 --> 10:49.637
the Texan had just opened up on What is that, South 
Main? South Texas. South College. South College,

10:52.801 --> 10:53.882
yeah. On South College. And that didn't look too 
appetizing. That was an old, run-down, drive-in

10:59.509 --> 11:12.184
hamburger place, I guess, before the new owners 
bought it and changed it to this really fine

10:59.509 --> 11:12.184
restaurant. We were surprised the first time we 
ate there. They really turned out good food. But

11:19.283 --> 11:25.491
several times, I know when we did move here several 
times, we'd go out to Caldwell to eat. We'd go out to

11:25.511 --> 11:31.338
the Surrey Inn out there to eat because there just 
weren't many choices here. Right. As you were

11:32.460 --> 11:35.584
looking for housing, what did you find? I didn't 
find anything off the bat, but I lucked out again

11:35.684 --> 11:41.511
because... One of the professors in the College of 
Liberal Arts in the Department of English,

11:42.267 --> 11:56.907
Cannon, Dr. Cannon, said that he was into the 
rental business and he had a home that people had

11:42.267 --> 11:56.907
rented were going to be moving. And he said, you 
know, he'd be more than happy if I wanted to rent

11:56.947 --> 12:04.157
that house. And that's what we did. We rented that 
house sight unseen. We rented that home and lived

12:10.978 --> 12:15.402
there the first two years we were here. Now, I said 
we weren't going to talk money again. What was that

12:17.684 --> 12:19.246
first rent? I have no idea. I don't recall what it 
was. I'll bet it was a little bit less than the cost

12:21.728 --> 12:27.394
in either St. Louis, Cleveland, or New York City. 
Oh, yes. In fact, that was another factor that came

12:28.535 --> 12:31.798
into play. You know, the beginning salary was not 
comparable to what people were talking about for

12:32.200 --> 12:46.035
assistant superintendent up in New York or 
superintendent of the suburb of Chicago. There

12:46.055 --> 12:47.497
was no comparison. But when you calculated in, 
factored in the cost of living, you could do pretty

12:48.238 --> 12:56.226
well. It wasn't still going to match a 
superintendent's job, but still. Right.

13:02.281 --> 13:06.167
Describe the faculty in education when you came. 
Who were the key veterans and the important

13:06.267 --> 13:12.036
newcomers and so forth? Well, the key person at 
that time, of course, was Dr. Paul Hansling, who

13:12.717 --> 13:19.487
was head of the department in My recollection was 
that he had somewhere along the line established a

13:19.467 --> 13:35.670
relationship with Frank W.R. Hubert out in the 
public school sector because Dr. Hubert had also

13:19.467 --> 13:35.670
been out at Orange, as I recall. and had risen to the 
status of a superintendent there before going to

13:35.650 --> 13:44.418
the Texas Education Agency. Now, I may have that 
reversed. He may have... Both. Both? He was my

13:49.222 --> 13:51.224
seventh grade band director. Then he goes away to 
the Army, comes back, is the principal in Orange,

13:51.664 --> 14:03.835
then goes to Austin with the Texas Education 
Agency, also completes his doctoral degree goes

14:04.135 --> 14:12.489
back to Orange as superintendent, and then comes 
here in 59 as the dean of arts and sciences before

14:04.135 --> 14:12.489
that was broken up. Now, one of the things that I'm 
pretty sure it was Frank W.R. Hubert that told me

14:12.509 --> 14:16.957
this. I feel fairly confident, but he's still 
alive, so you could check with Frank on this. But I

14:23.322 --> 14:29.210
believe at one time I may have asked him, you know, 
how did he end up at Texas A&M University? And he

14:30.051 --> 14:38.303
said he had this relationship with, I believe it 
was Edgars, who was commissioner, or... Yes. Is

14:39.785 --> 14:40.286
that right? Commissioner of Education? He had 
preceded, he was the superintendent in Orange.

14:47.251 --> 14:55.003
during World War II and then went to Austin as the 
superintendent of the Austin system and then

14:47.251 --> 14:55.003
moved up. And he knew Hubert well.

15:01.213 --> 15:02.014
Would you like coffee or tea, hot cider? Hot cider a 
little later, whenever he's going to have some.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.162
That was J.W.? J.W. Edgar. And the way I heard the 
story was that Earl Rudder when he decided that he

15:15.027 --> 15:26.118
wanted education to move at Texas A&M University 
and that he too had foreseen somewhere down the

15:15.027 --> 15:26.118
line a college of education. He had an opening for 
the Dean of Liberal Arts or may have been called

15:26.959 --> 15:33.766
Arts and Sciences. Arts and Sciences, yes. And he 
wanted to know who was the best educator in Texas

15:35.628 --> 15:43.296
that he could go after. and maybe convinced to come 
to Texas A&M. And the person he talked to was J.W.

15:49.888 --> 15:51.911
Edgars, Commissioner of Education. And the story 
I heard was that J.W. Edgars didn't hesitate. He

15:56.537 --> 15:58.600
said, that's Frank W.R. Hubert. And so he went 
after Hubert, and the rest is history. Okay, but

16:06.490 --> 16:09.654
who were the other key people? Okay, after Paul, 
within the department, To me it would have been

16:12.571 --> 16:20.420
Bill Graves, who was head of elementary education 
at that time. And Bill wanted to move more into

16:21.201 --> 16:32.133
concentrating on the graduate programs in 
elementary education. I forget who was in charge

16:32.153 --> 16:35.997
of secondary education at the time. But he would 
have been Bill Graves' counterpart at the

16:36.972 --> 16:41.659
secondary level. And he too wanted to get out of 
handling everything from undergraduate to

16:42.180 --> 16:52.396
graduate and concentrate more on the graduate 
programs. So both of those gentlemen were going to

16:53.137 --> 16:59.267
concentrate on bringing in new people who could 
take over the undergraduate program so it would

16:59.500 --> 17:06.490
free them up to concentrate on graduate programs. 
And that's pretty much what happened. Now, there

17:09.795 --> 17:11.878
were some reading people. Don Barker was there. He 
had an educational psychology background.

17:26.095 --> 17:32.157
don't recall, I'd have to get an old catalog out and 
kind of review who the key people were what was your

17:32.407 --> 18:01.435
describe your first assignments what were your 
courses and what did you see as your

17:32.407 --> 18:01.435
responsibilities well i had five courses that i 
had to teach and total responsibility for

17:32.407 --> 18:01.435
everything involving the elementary education 
program and my counterpart who came in at the same

17:32.407 --> 18:01.435
time had a secondary education background And he 
assumed total responsibility for the

18:01.415 --> 18:08.346
undergraduate secondary program. And both of us 
had... Who was that? Again, you know, I really need

18:13.374 --> 18:17.822
a catalog to pull that out. Jerry Salick. Jerry 
Salick. Jerry left after a couple of years and went

18:24.833 --> 18:28.519
on to other things, but... Jerry and I kind of hit it 
off because we were both coming in new, and we had

18:28.938 --> 18:40.415
come out of programs where they were kind of on 
cutting-edge things. For example, when I came

18:40.495 --> 18:52.853
down for my interview and talked to the faculty, 
made my presentation, it was on the use of

18:40.495 --> 18:52.853
development of non-graded technology. schools 
and the use of what was called Flanders

18:53.879 --> 19:08.038
interaction analysis, a technique to measure the 
verbal interaction between teachers and

18:53.879 --> 19:08.038
students in classrooms. And the faculty really 
was pretty oblivious to this. They really weren't

19:13.846 --> 19:15.348
up on this. They'd heard about it. They may have 
read some articles in magazines, but they didn't

19:16.991 --> 19:20.916
understand the details of it well jerry came out of 
that same kind of background and we immediately

19:21.419 --> 19:45.655
uh... started to talk about working together even 
though i was elementary with elementary

19:21.419 --> 19:45.655
prospective teachers and he was secondary with 
secondary prospective teachers we said you know

19:21.419 --> 19:45.655
maybe we can pool our resources and

19:46.259 --> 19:56.168
combine a lot of our programs and really benefit 
from each other. and the faculty that would be

19:57.312 --> 19:59.695
surrounding us. And that's true. That's true. 
That's what happened. With the blessing of Paul

20:04.863 --> 20:17.380
Hensling and Bill Graves and the person in charge 
of secondary, they thought that was a good

20:04.863 --> 20:17.380
concept. And they liked what was called a block 
program. They didn't know about block programs.

20:23.852 --> 20:27.057
And they wanted us to implement a block program. 
And we listened to them and said, yeah, we can do

20:27.117 --> 20:29.782
that. So there were so few students at the 
undergraduate level

20:38.437 --> 21:08.376
high enough status you know where they would be 
seniors i think i doubt if we had more than 30

20:38.437 --> 21:08.376
elementary and secondary students all together 
that would reach that level and we could pull them

20:38.437 --> 21:08.376
into a block program and offer them all 15 hours 
together and so we just combined them we put the

20:38.437 --> 21:08.376
elementary and secondary and jerry had some 
things that the elementary benefited from and he

21:09.115 --> 21:16.830
was delighted to have me train him in Flanders 
interaction analysis. They knew nothing about

21:16.890 --> 21:18.417
that. I think we only broke out for a course in 
elementary education, and he only broke out for a

21:18.903 --> 21:28.613
course in secondary education. Otherwise, the 
history and philosophy of education, the

21:28.693 --> 21:43.088
teaching patterns and so forth, we combined and 
ran those as one class block program. You

21:43.895 --> 21:47.341
mentioned a while ago responsibility for five 
courses to begin with. How many per semester were

21:48.402 --> 21:51.247
you teaching? I taught all five. You taught five? 
Five three-hour courses? Five three-hour

21:54.933 --> 21:55.955
courses. And at first, were there any graduate 
degrees available in education? Yes. There was a

22:04.028 --> 22:05.591
master's? There was a master's degree. 
Industrial Education, I believe it was, had their

22:08.954 --> 22:16.948
EDD, Doctor of Education. I think that was... But 
the enrollment was primarily undergraduate at

22:21.736 --> 22:25.643
the time you arrived. Well, actually, they had a 
pretty good graduate enrollment. It exceeded

22:30.973 --> 22:32.295
the... undergraduate enrollment as I recall

22:32.528 --> 22:51.938
I could be off on that but if not it was awfully close 
and I think it was because historically people

22:32.528 --> 22:51.938
went elsewhere for undergraduate degrees in 
education and then came to Texas A&M for their

22:51.918 --> 22:59.088
graduate degrees in either the Department of 
Education or Ag Education or Industrial

22:51.918 --> 22:59.088
Education. And Ag Education and the College of Ag 
and Industrial Ed and Engineering would come over

23:00.009 --> 23:13.709
to the Department of Education to get student 
teaching and a couple other courses, as I recall.

23:15.872 --> 23:18.195
As you began your work here, Where was education 
located physically? We were in the academic

23:22.970 --> 23:30.802
building and primarily on the top floor of the 
fourth floor of the old academic building. Any

23:31.283 --> 23:36.270
stories about your first office or getting moved 
in? Yes. Probably the funniest thing that

23:38.934 --> 23:43.862
happened to me was

23:45.462 --> 23:50.052
hiring people to work within the program. And 
while we were still housed in the academic

23:51.075 --> 24:02.560
building, one of the people that I hired was an 
experienced kindergarten teacher. Her name was

24:03.342 --> 24:04.585
Mary Bassett. And she had been teaching 
kindergarten out at the Presbyterian Church. And

24:13.855 --> 24:15.838
Mary came on board with us. And I can recall 
probably

24:15.938 --> 24:26.674
the very first year that the College of Education 
had been formed, we had a and i'd become a

24:28.527 --> 24:52.999
department head we had a meeting in in the room that 
we used on the fourth floor of the academic

24:28.527 --> 24:52.999
building and all of those rooms had all the windows 
had been nailed closed there there wasn't a window

24:28.527 --> 24:52.999
you could open and as i recall the story was because 
They had air conditioning now and they didn't want

24:52.979 --> 24:59.653
people opening those windows so they simply 
nailed the darn things. And it was really hot this

25:00.716 --> 25:07.410
one day that I was having a faculty meeting and as we 
were uh... going along in the faculty meeting and

25:08.977 --> 25:33.820
everyone was hot and we could hardly wait to get out 
of there we continued to talk and proceed with the

25:08.977 --> 25:33.820
faculty meeting and mary bassett just very 
quietly got up walked over to the windows and took

25:08.977 --> 25:33.820
her shoe off and broke the window

25:08.977 --> 25:33.820
she'd had enough of that hot room that I guess the 
air conditioner had gone out. Now, you ask how my

25:38.289 --> 25:40.816
office was. We shared offices then. There were 
always about two of us to an office. So I was sharing

25:45.951 --> 25:49.581
one of the small offices up there. Right, now you 
were certainly well qualified by experience in

25:49.797 --> 25:59.590
the real world of education and Hubert was. 
Hengeling, by and large was the departmental

25:59.671 --> 26:07.461
faculty all blessed with real education 
experience? I'd say so. Yeah, I'd say they had all

26:08.763 --> 26:13.189
been real practitioners out in the field. As you 
chatted with these people before you came down

26:13.625 --> 26:21.376
here, did they talk about doctoral work in the 
future? Were they hoping for doctoral programs in

26:22.117 --> 26:25.281
education? No, I think it was too early. I don't 
think the foresight that Frank Hubert had, and I

26:26.784 --> 26:40.543
assume in retrospect that was probably ongoing in 
the interaction with President Rutter, So they

26:40.523 --> 26:51.483
would have had information that the faculty would 
not have had as they were trying to grease the

26:40.523 --> 26:51.483
tracks to get a college of education established, 
which came very quickly. I mean, the end of my first

26:52.285 --> 26:59.378
year, I hadn't established myself statewide. I'd 
been over in met J.W. Edgars. I was back to make a

27:03.135 --> 27:20.858
presentation to the teacher

27:03.135 --> 27:20.858
education group there and won approval for the 
first kindergarten endorsement in the state of

27:03.135 --> 27:20.858
Texas, which threw everyone for a loop because 
They did not associate Texas A&M with being

27:21.563 --> 27:27.609
innovative and bringing in new educational 
programs. Nobody had a kindergarten endorsement

27:27.669 --> 27:32.213
in the state. But I made a presentation that Frank 
Hubert said went extremely well because he was

27:32.293 --> 27:40.521
there and Edgars liked it. And we just seemed to get 
almost immediate approval on implementing this

27:41.582 --> 27:50.490
new program.

27:52.411 --> 27:59.823
Those kinds of interactions, and Frank Hubert was 
kind of leading me along. He took me to various

28:00.624 --> 28:04.270
meetings throughout the state. So in the spring of 
my very first year here, University of Texas came

28:05.832 --> 28:12.242
calling. And I asked Dean Hubert if it would be all 
right if I went over. They wanted to interview me

28:17.759 --> 28:20.002
for a position. And his words to me were, yes, but 
don't you commit yourself until you come back here

28:20.844 --> 28:29.277
and talk to me. And I said, fine. They wined and 
dined, my wife and I, for two days over there at

28:32.692 --> 28:37.881
Forty Acres. And before I left over there, they 
offered me a position as assistant professor. My

28:48.460 --> 28:53.569
load would not be five courses, it would be one 
course. I would not have all these student

28:54.190 --> 28:59.985
teachers to be responsible for. I would have six 
graduate interns that I would work with. They said

29:05.579 --> 29:07.744
that would probably be my load each fall and each 
spring. So, wow. I came back and talked to Ida, and I

29:13.296 --> 29:17.420
said, I'm going over there. Boy, that is really 
some deal. And they offered me a salary increase,

29:20.864 --> 29:31.035
but I kept my word to Frank Hubert and went in and 
talked to him and told him I really couldn't turn

29:20.864 --> 29:31.035
that down. That was so remarkable. And that's when 
he said, well, listen, now this is not well known,

29:34.927 --> 29:51.753
but we're going to have a college of education, and 
I really want you to stay and be on the ground floor

29:34.927 --> 29:51.753
to form a foundation. I see you as one of my 
department heads in this new college of

29:51.974 --> 30:00.787
education, and we'll match their salary. And he 
said, You can count on me to let you decide what your

30:04.795 --> 30:18.475
load's going to be because if my prediction is 
right, you'll have the authority to do that. Wow.

30:20.297 --> 30:22.200
And you'd been out of graduate school one year. One 
year. Pretty interesting year. It was. It was

30:24.944 --> 30:26.466
unbelievable. Now that growth pattern at Texas 
A&M was just unparalleled, I think, in the history

30:27.290 --> 30:35.925
of maybe education period. Because in 
retrospect, I think Rutter probably got that

30:37.067 --> 30:49.990
college of education established faster than 
anyone had ever gotten a college of education

30:37.067 --> 30:49.990
established. We had, as I recall, 600 ladies that 
first year I came here. It doubled the second year.

30:59.322 --> 31:00.163
I think it was 1,200. And it doubled again the third 
year. It was like 2,400. So there, Rutter and

31:04.330 --> 31:09.598
Hubert's crystal ball gazing was coming true. 
They saw that kind of a massive growth taking place

31:09.658 --> 31:16.809
at A&M. Describe... You said you were with Hubert a 
few times when he made presentations to various

31:19.450 --> 31:24.535
groups. Describe his technique.
