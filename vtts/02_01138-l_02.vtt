WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:08.204
Well, I can assure you that my tape is going to sound 
real good about the time those cows are coming up.

00:11.628 --> 00:13.010
Did you have your tape on? Oh, I had it on, yeah. My 
lord, I didn't know that. That's what's so funny,

00:16.113 --> 00:18.996
because here come these guys. It sounds like 
August in Brooklyn. When I began to call, come on,

00:25.732 --> 00:28.515
they just come to care. They just to come. They 
really do. You know, that people really don't

00:30.037 --> 00:32.780
realize that. But animals love you if you love 
them. Oh, sure they do. Hello there. She's a pretty

00:38.946 --> 00:39.887
thing. That's a pretty thing. Yeah. Is she going to 
have a calf? Or is she just... No, she has one. She

00:46.475 --> 00:47.355
has one. Okay, I was looking at her other... Yeah, I 
saw her bag and I thought maybe she was... And she's

00:52.597 --> 00:54.540
looked awfully big in the sides. She's just big. I 
told you that this old cow is going off down there.

00:59.447 --> 00:59.808
Yeah. She's 18 years old. The other one is 20. I've 
got one here that's 22. But she is a black,

01:05.777 --> 01:13.128
without any horns, a muley. And she has a real 
pretty calf. Well, there she is right there. I see

01:18.810 --> 01:19.451
her. Yeah. Yeah, down below. Right, here he is 
again. Now listen, little boy, you go on. Mama's

01:23.176 --> 01:31.429
got to go home, and I'm going to come down and get you 
and put you in the trailer and take you home, put you

01:23.176 --> 01:31.429
in the yard. Maybe I can sell you. I believe he'll 
weigh at least 850. Sure. 850 pounds. Why not? And I

01:41.846 --> 01:44.710
sell him for $50. five cents a pound. Nobody would 
believe you're standing here with an 800 pound

01:46.806 --> 01:53.052
animal like that, hugging him and petting him. 
Just loving him up. Right. I want to take him to town

01:54.954 --> 01:56.456
with me. Now there's another old cow, right up 
there. But they just look in such good condition.

02:04.505 --> 02:05.025
They are. And they've got good calves. Look at all 
these calves, how fat they are. Yeah. Now you know

02:12.128 --> 02:14.050
that's a pretty bull. He is. That hump on his back is 
incredible. Look at that hind. He's a good bull.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.381
Pretty as he can be.

02:29.025 --> 02:33.991
I'm

02:29.025 --> 02:33.991
proud of him. Well I guess the reason I am so proud If 
you work for things, work hard.

02:43.381 --> 02:45.644
Oh, sweat and guts. That means a lot. I promised you 
I was going to show you a big post, didn't I? You did.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.316
From cedar. That's right. And all of this, these 
posts that you see right here, have been cut from

02:55.860 --> 03:03.972
right around here, from down there at the holler. 
Oh, my gosh. Yeah, this isn't anything like the

03:06.036 --> 03:08.901
cedars you see growing. No, you do see out there. 
That's what you call cypress cedar. Now, of

03:12.307 --> 03:18.177
course, here's some of that old lumber. The 
cypress. Cypress I can see, yeah. And this, of

03:21.684 --> 03:24.188
course, I know it's not.

03:35.170 --> 03:45.445
Because we're going to have to put something over 
this because our paddles will eventually fall in.

03:45.485 --> 03:47.188
What is this? Well, this is a storm cellar. Now 
look. Oh, I see it. It sure enough is. Built down in

03:52.977 --> 03:55.060
the ground like that. Now just come around here. 
You can't believe the size of that slug. Ooh. Look

04:01.829 --> 04:02.511
through there. Ooh, my goodness. Now that is a 
cedar log. That's the size of... Look at it. That's

04:09.705 --> 04:11.749
the beam that goes clear across it. Well, Ava, 
that's the biggest thing. That's what I'm telling

04:13.413 --> 04:14.655
you. That's one of the biggest things that you've 
ever seen. That's a good two foot deep. That's at

04:20.868 --> 04:28.409
least 10

04:20.868 --> 04:28.409
feet. And that log comes from right back here to 
right up there. and that's the land has changed 20.

04:35.414 --> 04:53.997
yes the land has changed and this was built here 
when that old house because this is a path a tornado

04:35.414 --> 04:53.997
path through here and i never will forget ola and i 
ran into this one time we saw the tornado coming

04:53.977 --> 04:58.262
through the field and took the roof off the barn. 
That's the reason that barn looks like that. Took

05:02.446 --> 05:05.830
the roof off and tore up the goat shed. And we ran 
down and got in this hole in this thing right here.

05:12.857 --> 05:15.179
Of course, it didn't look quite as bad as it does 
now. And Olin Akron went over and he said, Avery,

05:15.199 --> 05:21.486
you know, I'll bet you that We'd look around here. 
We'd find a rattlesnake. Yeah, I was going to ask

05:25.836 --> 05:26.958
you. And I looked up over the door and asked if they 
didn't stand. But they lay out straight across

05:32.568 --> 05:36.214
that doorway. Yeah, I was looking down in there. A 
great big old chicken snake. Oh, gosh. Yeah,

05:43.147 --> 05:45.611
that's a perfect place for a few rattlers. This 
one's going to tip. This is really weather-worn

05:48.365 --> 05:59.822
and whatnot and has all kinds of tacks in it, but I 
think that I'll take it anyway. Why not?

06:03.327 --> 06:04.248
I'd like to keep it. I think so. Yeah, this is a nice 
piece of land.

06:14.042 --> 06:14.423
Well...

06:18.115 --> 06:19.438
All these old rusted things. That's my rake. This 
is the registered primer. First one we ever had.

06:29.899 --> 06:30.701
Number 18.

06:35.550 --> 06:36.532
I love those. Those are so good.

06:42.753 --> 06:44.815
And just window weights, I see window weights. You 
don't see many of these iron single trees anymore.

06:49.381 --> 06:50.562
No, you don't. Yeah, see what that is.

06:59.994 --> 07:01.195
Heard the dove flying over there. You don't see any 
beaded ceiling, see that? Yeah, I see the beaded

07:05.180 --> 07:06.502
ceiling. I saw some of that over on the barn 
somebody nailed a little up. Yeah. What is this

07:11.693 --> 07:13.656
thing all twisted? Oh, that's part of your wire. 
Yeah, that's wire that we used to use on the river.

07:19.687 --> 07:21.591
We've got two rolls of that left. You've got a 
critter that's dug its way under that, too. Oh,

07:26.199 --> 07:26.639
yes. I'd like him not to be a skunk, okay? I don't 
imagine. What do you think? Armadillo. An old

07:34.373 --> 07:35.295
armadillo? Yeah, I bet you're right. What is this 
little plant here? I used to love to pick it and

07:40.012 --> 07:42.296
smell it. Well,

07:43.078 --> 07:52.235
it's a mint plant, but I don't know. We'll have to 
name it. It's one of my favorite smells. You can

07:56.042 --> 08:00.330
walk through this stuff and everything begins to 
take on that scent.

08:06.571 --> 08:30.908
oh that's a pretty little calf they're all pretty 
his little brown head looks like he's got let me

08:06.571 --> 08:30.908
tell you that that'll make a good bull that one look 
at straight that back here yeah proud stepper oh he

08:06.571 --> 08:30.908
has got a good bull yeah he's a good bull look at him 
well uh he's he's high off the ground oh ava he's

08:06.571 --> 08:30.908
beautiful i'll have to get and get a hold of him. 
Look at here. Suck in it. Yeah. Look at here. And

08:37.760 --> 08:38.682
suck it. Yeah. Two of them. And think. 20 years old. 
And she's still Yeah,

08:45.952 --> 08:54.685
he's getting a meal.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.072
Oh, that's amazing. You love to be loved, don't 
you? Yeah, that's one of the pretty ones right

09:03.257 --> 09:06.220
there. Yeah. He's going to be a good bull. That's 
going to make a good bull calf. He's got a good head

09:09.944 --> 09:11.046
on him. Mm-hmm. Good straight back. Mm-hmm. Yeah, 
he really does. I've got the idea, too. He's going

09:20.656 --> 09:21.917
to be a good bull. I can already tell. He does have 
the idea.

09:29.343 --> 09:30.385
We have to get out the window.

09:33.973 --> 09:36.699
I wish I had a picture of that. We're going to get a 
camera and get out here and do the photography.

09:41.048 --> 09:46.660
When I come out, we'll have to come out here another 
time in the fall and stay and do this.

09:55.718 --> 09:57.000
Look at those big thunderheads. They won't amount 
to anything. I don't know. But they're pretty over

09:59.104 --> 10:00.486
there. Just late in the evening.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.922
They're not in the right place. No.

10:31.662 --> 10:32.884
So white and clean. He looks like he's got a little 
toupee on. He sure does, that little red. Yeah,

10:36.870 --> 10:39.013
this is parted right down the middle cone, right? 
And he looks good. Well.

10:49.229 --> 10:49.369
Uh-huh. I like the ranch.

10:53.976 --> 10:54.958
I like this one, too. Yeah. That's a good heifer. 
Mm-hmm. Yes. That pretty head, that pretty back.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.361
She's pretty. You bet. That's a good bloodied one. 
That's a good one. That's a good heifer. Yeah, she

11:11.508 --> 11:11.908
is. Yeah, look at

11:11.929 --> 11:15.492
that. Look how, when you see those black ones, they 
shine. And that looks just like silk. It does. I

11:23.539 --> 11:26.222
want to tell you, that's good bloodied when they do 
that. Look at that neck right here on this one. It's

11:30.985 --> 11:33.269
just like sheets of velvet. Absolutely. Can't 
afford to hustle her because she's old. She's the

11:39.037 --> 11:41.621
oldest, yeah. She's fine. But she's fat. She's in 
good shape. I wouldn't have known she was 20 years

11:45.387 --> 11:48.111
old. You just don't look at cattle and think that, 
well, they are. But they are. I know how old these

11:52.758 --> 11:56.864
are because we raised them. Sure.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.570
They have a calf a year. Is that not right? Now, Ava, 
there's a plant that I've got to figure out what it

12:10.235 --> 12:14.124
is. What is that over there? I may have to go look at 
it. Well, I haven't noticed it. I'll open the gate

12:20.678 --> 12:21.640
and we'll see.

12:39.068 --> 12:39.899
Write it!

14:17.905 --> 14:19.607
So you say that's a polecat bush?

14:25.693 --> 14:25.753
Mm. My fingers smell from that. Oh, yes, they'll 
smell for a long time. OK. Oh, those are pretty.

14:34.002 --> 14:34.762
That's pretty wood. Nice pieces of wood. Well, you 
know what? I'm getting this farm. What? I'm going

14:39.607 --> 14:42.711
to, you take them. We'll get you in the car and I'll 
take them. OK.

14:56.026 --> 15:01.421
Brass lids, curl lids, just the outside. You cut 
you a piece of pasteboard, put you a piece of burlap

15:01.441 --> 15:07.639
on it, And you take, well, you see how this goes. You 
can see the grain coming here. And you cut your

15:14.200 --> 15:20.169
piece about this long and about that wide. And you 
cut it because it'll, see that grain goes clear

15:20.510 --> 15:26.439
through and it won't take much to cut it. And you 
paste it on this piece of burlap on this

15:27.241 --> 15:31.548
pasteboard. You get you some pinto beans. Uh-huh. 
And you get a big one, a middle one, and a very small

15:34.973 --> 15:42.067
one. And because you can find the different sizes 
in the beans. All right. And take your marks a lot.

15:50.463 --> 15:52.948
And put the little eyes. and make the little nose, 
and draw the little owl's body back like this, and

15:53.536 --> 16:05.770
paste them on, and you've got three little owls. 
Sitting on a piece of wood. Sitting on a piece of

16:07.912 --> 16:09.294
wood. What a cute idea. Well, cute as it can be, my 
book. And you take them. Oh, I've got two little

16:16.807 --> 16:20.334
washboards. Uh-huh. Oh, I've had them ever 
since... Well, the first one I bought when I went to

16:21.677 --> 16:28.430
school in St. Marcus. Mm-hmm. 1948. The other one I 
bought in 19... 60 when I was in San Antonio.

16:39.332 --> 16:53.669
Because I'd take one, kept one at home and one down 
there just to rub my clothes out on so that I didn't

16:39.332 --> 16:53.669
have to start the washing machine, save 
electricity, do it the hard way for old cocks. But

16:53.689 --> 16:54.710
that was me. That's what it is. And you'd take those 
little washboards. Yeah. And at the bottom part

17:01.340 --> 17:13.893
where the two little legs come down, you fill that 
in and let it extend out and put a lid on it and fold it

17:01.340 --> 17:13.893
back up. Put your lid on your little box and has the 
things on it. And up here at the top, put you two

17:19.979 --> 17:30.790
hooks that you can hook it up with and

17:19.979 --> 17:30.790
put the, put it up on your outside porch put your 
comb in there put your brush in there and say have a

17:31.799 --> 17:55.630
scrub you'll look better oh how cute yeah just make 
that little box yeah then on the back then i had

17:31.799 --> 17:55.630
another idea of making a complete box on the back 
and using the washboard as the door, and put the

17:55.846 --> 18:14.249
latch there, and the little medicine shelf, and 
put it, and put that up for, you know, just for

17:55.846 --> 18:14.249
somebody to, well, I don't know. Well, that's what 
folk art is, Ava, thinking of things that are

18:14.610 --> 18:20.237
creative. Yeah, that's a darling idea. I don't 
know just how well I can get it done, but I thought I

18:23.808 --> 18:26.332
would. Well, I know you. I've seen the things 
you've done. I thought I'd do it, and I've got this

18:28.596 --> 18:33.204
wood, and I'm going to try that. Is this where you 
saw the eagles that time? Yeah, sure is, right

18:36.049 --> 18:37.411
here. I kept saying, see the eagle? He's catching 
something. He's taking it all from there. Yep,

18:42.920 --> 18:45.124
right here's where we saw the eagles. All right, I 
told you there'd be more buses. Look at them down on

18:48.691 --> 18:49.895
the bottom. You're right. There's now how many on 
one now? There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Is

18:56.473 --> 18:57.938
that right? Yeah, but I bet you there's 12. I told 
you they'd be 12. I think you're right. I see one in

19:03.793 --> 19:05.435
the middle. You've been counting these buzzards 
when you come out here. I sure have. Yeah, they're

19:08.760 --> 19:09.481
12 of them. I don't know. That's perfectly silly. 
What difference does it make whether it's five or

19:13.547 --> 19:15.710
six? They're on the pole. They're on the, yeah. 
They're 12. They're out there, but I said, well,

19:18.995 --> 19:21.979
they're 12.

19:24.777 --> 19:28.501
Well, that one's still by itself. I guess they're 
on the nest. The other three are still, they still

19:29.482 --> 19:32.825
may be out for the prowl. One, two, three. No, 
there's two down there on that other one. Yeah.

19:36.749 --> 19:44.297
Three, and three are six, and three's nine, by 
golly, since there's 11, 12. I see them down yonder

19:44.497 --> 19:46.099
on the other. They'll all be up there in a little 
bit.

19:50.904 --> 19:51.004
Yeah.

19:54.173 --> 19:57.236
There he is again. Now she's... She's taking us 
down the road. Yeah. She's leaving us away from her

20:06.824 --> 20:09.187
baby. Yeah, she's staying in the middle of the 
road, isn't she? She's looking back. Follow me.

20:16.813 --> 20:18.615
Oh, here, look who's coming. Here comes Pop. Now 
that's the male, isn't it? Yeah, this is the male

20:20.897 --> 20:22.338
right here. Oh, they're both She's not going to 
leave. Those babies are right there. She went on

20:28.194 --> 20:29.537
down the road. Yeah, she's leading us off. Yeah. 
Now she's cutting back. She's gone now. Wherever

20:36.471 --> 20:37.253
she went. Right there she went. Right around this 
thing. Right here. Okay. She's already turned

20:41.141 --> 20:43.727
around and come back to hunt her babies. That's 
something. Well, I'll tell you right now, you'll

20:47.296 --> 20:56.998
just learn a lot about nature just by riding around 
and looking at things. And you understand

21:02.197 --> 21:04.981
if they knew a little more about nature. I know they 
would. There is such a gap between the parent and

21:06.283 --> 21:10.369
child. It's not done in the animal world. It's just 
a shame it's happening within the human

21:13.934 --> 21:17.199
existence. I cannot conceive it. I guess that's 
why I never had any children, because the

21:19.803 --> 21:27.014
stability was such that I saw it couldn't be done, 
really. Look at the big old jackrabbit again.

21:29.377 --> 21:30.920
Isn't he pretty? Yeah. You know, a male rabbit 
never squats like that. You know, I, good. I never,

21:39.373 --> 21:46.684
I wanted to know what made some of them kind of run 
with that squatted look to them and some that

21:39.373 --> 21:46.684
there's a cubby of quail. Oh yeah, I think I've seen 
it last. Nope, that was a female. Okay, so she kind

21:53.013 --> 21:55.756
of runs with her body low like that. Yes. I don't 
remember that. I've seen it, but I just didn't know

21:58.080 --> 22:00.503
what it was. Jack runs high and his head high. And a 
female low and she'll keep her ears down. They were

22:13.376 --> 22:16.541
forward when she was running. That's right. I 
learned my lesson about jackrabbits today. A lot

22:21.929 --> 22:23.932
of lessons. Oh, well. I'm going to enjoy listening 
to this tape when the camera came in. That's right.

22:32.630 --> 22:35.334
I didn't know you had the thing on. Yeah, I've had it 
on ever since we left. Well, ever since we started

22:38.339 --> 22:42.065
into the ranch, I wanted to get a full tape of the 
ranch. We're covering a lot of territory today.

22:45.010 --> 22:46.752
Well, we sure have. I don't know how good he is. 
Well, I feel that if I can spend the last month of

22:48.756 --> 22:55.907
September just doing this, you know? Yeah. Then I 
got an A. I've got a lot of, I've got a lot of

23:00.592 --> 23:04.540
research. Look at here. Oh, what a pretty rabbit. 
What's he doing? He's... Is that a male? Sure it is.

23:12.396 --> 23:12.516
Yeah. Don't you see those? The ears are the way they 
are. I thought I was going to say it was a male.

23:16.925 --> 23:17.867
That's a male rabbit. I'm seeing the difference.

23:21.989 --> 23:44.014
big things they're almost as big as the deal they 
sure are you know during during the early 20s uh 19

23:21.989 --> 23:44.014
oh well i said the early 20s i guess is they 18 19 18 19 
19. uh they paid a bounty on long-eared jack

23:21.989 --> 23:44.014
rackets What were they doing, running over the 
land? They were eating everything that was dry and

23:47.433 --> 23:53.040
just eating up the grass. Oh, just destructive. I 
can remember cutting them off, and some of them

23:55.663 --> 24:01.870
wouldn't be as long as we bought them. We'd stretch 
them. Oh? Oh, I mean to tell you, listen, there

24:03.812 --> 24:11.421
wasn't anything we didn't try to do to make a dime to 
have something to eat. And I guarantee you that.

24:13.263 --> 24:14.625
And I've eaten enough. Jackrabbits, 
cottontails, white gravy, cornbread. We didn't

24:23.252 --> 24:24.975
have biscuits in the office. Great what you had, 
right? And man alive, I've eaten it and just, I just

24:27.298 --> 24:32.767
fill up on it. And you know, I think that Kreiser 
gravy was, oh, it was good. My goodness, my mother

24:37.575 --> 24:40.420
could make that stuff. And it was really good. Of 
course, they'll call it cream gravy now. But what

24:45.626 --> 24:46.729
did you call it? Crider gravy. Crider gravy. How 
did you get that? I've never... What I got is that's

24:50.177 --> 24:52.964
where it originated. In this part of the world. 
Mm-hmm. It's Crider. Old Grandma Crider. I like

24:59.662 --> 25:03.187
Dan's mother. I saw a pretty dragonfly. It was red. 
Did you see? No. It had red wings. An orangey-red

25:09.535 --> 25:10.956
one. Well, I haven't seen an orangey-red one. 
That's what it was. Okay, I'll catch another gate.

25:18.626 --> 25:22.311
I'm going to put mine there while you hold yours 
with it.

26:04.107 --> 26:14.230
There

26:04.107 --> 26:14.230
we go. What'd you lose? I probably broke my 
cigarette. No, you left those at home. Well,

26:19.763 --> 26:20.744
that's good. You just mean she get another one when 
you get... Well, I just... This week's the first

26:25.931 --> 26:31.638
time in over a month that I... You get to do what you 
want. When I... You're being a bad girl. Besides, I

26:34.923 --> 26:38.548
smoke the cigarette, and it's not that I want it. 
It's just... Oh, it is, I guess, too. Uh-huh.

26:47.543 --> 26:49.687
I don't like to come home this time of day. It's bad 
on me. Oh, yeah, you're right. Well, if you want me

26:51.811 --> 26:54.356
to drive, let me know, and I will. Just say so, and 
I'll be glad to. All right. Because it's awful

26:57.462 --> 26:58.744
bright. This is good. I'll make it. Look at the 
spider webs all over the grass. Yes, ma'am. And it

27:06.319 --> 27:07.781
won't rain this week. They're everywhere. 
They're everywhere. Yes, ma'am.

27:13.261 --> 27:15.683
I don't think it's going to rain this week. I don't 
think it will. Unless they pull up stakes and call

27:17.325 --> 27:19.868
in webs. Yeah, because they sure are thick. They 
are. They are everywhere. Now that is, Ava, I've

27:27.255 --> 27:30.538
grown up seeing this. And some days they'll be 
there and some days they won't. And I will reckon to

27:33.721 --> 27:40.568
say that, sure enough, I understand that. Well, we 
don't seem to attribute. We attribute everything

27:44.715 --> 27:56.230
to the migration of birds, but we never attribute 
anything to spiders, spider webs, cattle, corn

27:44.715 --> 27:56.230
cobs, you know, and everything. We seem to only 
attribute birds with a sense of

27:56.790 --> 28:05.361
their migration. It's a shame. Because all things 
are in tune to nature's way.

28:18.922 --> 28:20.965
I've come along here many a time. Right here is 
where we used to turn in to go to our place, right

28:21.145 --> 28:25.370
here. That's a beautiful drive down that way to the 
ranch. It's rough, but it's sure pretty. So that's

28:32.179 --> 28:33.481
still your land? No, this isn't. That's 
Wendless's, but ours joins just right down there,

28:34.882 --> 28:39.748
not far. And he just has a small neck right here. 
Well, now, if I came up this road from the other

28:46.546 --> 28:50.633
way... Shoot, I intend to take you back and show you 
that. Oh, okay. Well, would that be better than

28:54.679 --> 28:58.886
driving with the sun in your eyes, probably? Well, 
we'll just go up here and turn around, and I'll take

28:59.006 --> 29:03.654
you down. All right. He's a sassy old mockingbird, 
right? Is that what you're looking at? I'm going to

29:07.520 --> 29:08.942
go up here and turn around. Okay, yeah, here's a 
good place.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.032
Well, I've seen the Hill Country at some pretty 
times this year. The blue bonnets were

29:21.052 --> 29:22.376
incredible. I've never seen anything quite as 
beautiful. When I was up, we went out and looked at

29:25.667 --> 29:30.643
that ocean of blue.

29:36.226 --> 29:38.929
I don't want to get hit either way. Next spring, I do 
plan to come and to collect herbs. So we'll start

29:45.697 --> 29:48.099
the season right, okay? Okay. I told Brother Lynch 
about you, so I'm sure that we can talk him into

29:49.541 --> 29:54.426
coming up with us. He would get a kick out of that. 
Really

29:55.768 --> 29:59.652
would. Think he'd get a kick out of seeing a little 
bull in the front yard? Aw, he would. You know, he's

30:06.173 --> 30:09.277
one of the oldest teaching brothers at St. 
Edward's University. Oh, really? Yeah, he is.

30:10.838 --> 30:11.900
He's a very good man. I get along with him very, very 
well. He started teaching there in 1952. And his

30:19.208 --> 30:25.875
entire life thesis has been about the plants. of 
this particular region in Texas. So he finally

30:29.844 --> 30:38.901
finished his book, and it's very well 
illustrated, and I want a copy for myself, and I

30:29.844 --> 30:38.901
want to... Well, we'll try and... Have to get you a 
copy. Well, someday. Oh, well... Just as time goes

30:40.524 --> 30:43.871
on. If I write a good article, I'll get it. I've got 
to get my feet on the ground. financially before I

30:48.620 --> 30:52.164
can do much of anything right now. Well, you work on 
that. I've got to figure out where the ground is

30:53.345 --> 30:57.510
before I even start putting my feet down. That's my 
problem. I'll tell you right now. I'm not kidding

31:01.474 --> 31:02.876
you one. Oh. That big, big, fat thing. I'm going to 
get out there and move the whole thing up just that

31:06.299 --> 31:12.005
little bit. Yeah. They build girls big up here, 
ain't they? Oh.

31:21.577 --> 31:28.528
Well, I enjoy meeting kids out here

31:21.577 --> 31:28.528
in the fields a while ago. 1,800 pounds, that one. 
Oh, my Lord, yes. And I was petting an 1,800. Whoa.

31:40.005 --> 31:47.536
Yeah, that does amaze

31:40.005 --> 31:47.536
people. Well, someday I'm going to get me a good... 
picture of him. That may be soon. I've had enough

31:53.298 --> 31:59.111
photography friends and we'll get out of here with 
the old click click and get some good stuff. Where

31:59.131 --> 32:02.659
he's laying down and you're rubbing his head. Uh 
huh. Uh huh. Really? It'd be really worth it. Mmm.

32:10.615 --> 32:14.421
We've been to Hippie Holler. See those vans? 
They've been across the river. Now you see what

32:19.750 --> 32:21.713
we've missed? Oh, what? We missed Hippie Holler? 
No, we've been across the river to meet Willie. Oh

32:27.802 --> 32:29.485
yeah, we missed Willie today. Hey, but look at that 
pear tree. It's just as ripe as it can be. I've got a

32:35.627 --> 32:37.310
bunch of pear up the house. All you do? Go get all you 
want. Did your apples turn out good? Pretty good. I

32:42.477 --> 32:43.639
have a good menu. In the co-op in Austin, I'm a 
member of the food co-op. Yeah. They're having

32:50.002 --> 32:54.167
Texas Holland apples. They're the best things 
I've ever eaten. They really are. They're tart.

32:58.293 --> 33:00.155
They almost tasted like a pear. They really did. 
But I wondered if they were grown up here. Oh, we

33:03.779 --> 33:06.603
have lots of apples grown in this part of the 
country. Yeah, I knew Morrison was into that, but I

33:06.623 --> 33:10.508
just wasn't sure. Yeah, we have lots of them in 
Gillespie County. Blanco County is just now

33:14.472 --> 33:16.274
starting them. Well, we've had them for a couple of 
years. We have the yellow delicious and the red

33:19.318 --> 33:21.961
delicious. Yeah, I've seen that. Boy, and they're 
good. Yeah, I ate a red delicious Texas apple,

33:24.724 --> 33:31.753
organically grown here, so I assumed it was from up 
this way.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.338
So that's what I would like to do. If there was a way 
to have a piece of land right now, I would go out and

33:35.358 --> 33:46.452
put a cabin on it and plant some peach trees, fruit 
trees, and plan to retire on it eventually and

33:35.358 --> 33:46.452
write books. How does that sound? That sounds 
good. There is enough to write. You don't have to go

33:50.798 --> 33:52.861
very far up here. You can spend your days writing 
poetry just by sitting on your front porch, right?

33:57.647 --> 33:58.688
Isn't that right? You really can. Yeah, we did miss 
Willie's party. It seems like everybody's

34:02.948 --> 34:05.785
leaving. Mama.

34:11.660 --> 34:14.604
Because people like that can't be coming from just 
anywhere. Oh, no. And, you know, you can tell his

34:15.625 --> 34:21.173
eye before you see him. Right.

34:24.698 --> 34:27.601
You know something, Ava, that amazes me. Here you 
have cowboys in Texas, right? That's right. The

34:31.206 --> 34:38.376
kids have adopted this cowboy, you know, cosmic 
cowboy, I think is what we can call it. But I never,

34:38.710 --> 34:46.462
in my life, have I seen a true cowboy walk into a 
place and he doesn't take his hat off. Right? I've

34:47.544 --> 34:48.986
never yet seen one. So you can always tell when one 
is the gentleman when they walk in and they wear

34:49.227 --> 34:54.856
their hat. Honey, it don't make any difference. 
You can tell a thoroughbred from the doggie from

34:56.538 --> 35:02.207
the time you see it. You're right. I know. And we've 
got a heck of a bunch of doggies running around.

35:08.839 --> 35:23.303
Anytime you see a cowboy, that they pretend to be a 
cowboy, and they've got that hat dipped down in

35:08.839 --> 35:23.303
front, and they've got it dipped down in the back, 
and a bunch of damn feathers in it, you just say, no,

35:08.839 --> 35:23.303
that's not my time. He couldn't ride a broomstick. 
That's right. Yeah, those are the cosmic kind,

35:29.774 --> 35:33.238
right? I cannot understand why they want to ruin a 
good hat like that. Yeah, yeah. Dipping it down in

35:40.565 --> 35:43.748
front, dipping it down in the back. Curling the 
sides. Barely curl up the sides. Which place was a

35:47.192 --> 35:48.794
nice little bar? Well, this is down here at Colonel 
Hagnell's. Colonel Hagnell's? Hagnell's. Okay.

35:56.762 --> 35:57.823
He's a... used to be an exceptionally good friend 
of Olin's. I haven't seen him since Olin died.

36:05.179 --> 36:07.923
Well, I just don't... I think his wife is dead. In 
fact, I never did see her. I don't know if he had a

36:13.291 --> 36:16.075
wife or not. But this is his place. But Olin came and 
visited him quite often. But I never did. Well, I

36:24.348 --> 36:26.353
was always teaching at school. I was always done. 
Is he older than Olin or around his age? He was about

36:29.361 --> 36:31.125
Olin's age. I see. And a colonel. He's a typical 
Army man. Oh, really? I've been at two, three

36:36.218 --> 36:40.028
parties where he was, but I've never... Uh-huh. I 
have a nice place over here. Yes, he does. He really

36:44.115 --> 36:45.076
does. Very well kept. In regimental tradition, I 
might say. Right? Cadillac in the garage. I saw

36:53.210 --> 36:53.851
him. Oh, he has... He lives well. Undoubtedly, he 
has all... The things that life desires, I guess.

37:04.051 --> 37:06.855
Career man, obviously. Huh? Career army officer. 
Yes, yes. Mm-hmm. And then if he's in his 80s, he

37:10.641 --> 37:15.568
must be very interesting. I don't know. He may not 
have been quite as old as Owen, but I believe he was.

37:20.215 --> 37:21.396
Still, 70s, 80s. Yeah, he was. He's seen his share 
of American history. I'm telling you right now

37:25.623 --> 37:27.345
that...

37:29.992 --> 37:33.717
He's a pretty good stepper. Oh, is he? Okay. So I 
don't know. Well, why not? Well, I don't blame him.

37:41.347 --> 37:42.468
Why not? Why not? That's right. And just because I 
can't do it, that doesn't mean I feel a fallout with

37:44.150 --> 37:49.577
anybody that does. You're going to have to watch 
yourself go on another cruise.

37:54.664 --> 37:55.645
You know... that was a lost cause uh was it yeah 
that's just the gate too i went to that i came out

37:57.211 --> 38:20.181
there one time walking from the ranch down here to 
this place now i want to tell you something before

37:57.211 --> 38:20.181
we get there okay this is hammett's crossing 
hammett's cross hammett's crossing on the river

38:20.161 --> 38:24.007
This is Hammett's Crossing on the river. Yeah. And 
this is the only place that you could cross this

38:24.448 --> 38:39.571
river from up there at Johnson City down to here 
with a wagon or a team to go anywhere. At Hammett's

38:39.591 --> 38:40.632
Crossing. At Hammett's Crossing right down here. 
By West Cave. West Cave, right. That's right. This

38:47.583 --> 38:53.497
was the only toll bridge that was ever put up on the 
Perdomales River. An old man hammock put it up

38:53.978 --> 38:59.451
himself, and that's the way he paid for it. And you 
can see, and now this has been built. This road has

39:04.002 --> 39:06.209
been leveled down. By the way, this was just a 
straight out bluff. They blasted this and put it

39:09.238 --> 39:13.491
down to where you could get out. But this has always 
been the first time I ever came over it. I thought we

39:19.173 --> 39:21.937
were going to fall off in the river. I really did. I 
really did. Because of the fact there was no let

39:24.520 --> 39:29.987
down to it. It was just a straight up and down bluff. 
So he built a bridge across the bluff. And he built

39:34.813 --> 39:36.355
the bridge across. And this is what we always 
called Hippie Hall. Right up this thing. Right up

39:42.863 --> 39:44.525
here. By West Cave. Yeah, they've got it fenced all 
the way down. Ava, that river's the finest looking

39:48.730 --> 39:51.012
thing. Now, here's where we'd have to come across. 
You see what I mean? Yeah, I see what you mean. And

39:55.276 --> 40:03.423
you'd put on all the brakes that you had on your 
wagon, and then you thought, well, you just

39:55.276 --> 40:03.423
couldn't make it. Now, of course, the highway has 
built this top point, but it was always built out

40:03.443 --> 40:13.192
of, well, yonder's part of it, right over yonder. 
And these rocks, see right here? And they were all

40:15.215 --> 40:16.879
taken out. Sure. And that was done. Well, there's 
some steel of it right there. Yeah. And you see how

40:21.390 --> 40:23.856
they circled that around? This was steel that was 
built. that he had put in there, and rocks and

40:27.719 --> 40:31.904
things. And look over yonder. Isn't that 
beautiful water? That is the prettiest,

40:34.648 --> 40:37.952
prettiest view of this part of the river. Now, 
we're already in Travis County now. Oh, sure, yes.

40:40.816 --> 40:42.157
Way over in Travis County. Now, we're going up the 
river. You see, this is what the... Yeah, I see the

40:46.202 --> 40:48.966
nude swimmers. Damn. See them all down the river 
down there. I sure do. Having a good time. Shoot.

40:56.558 --> 40:59.882
You know what happened to them at my place? Oh, no. 
Well, I can imagine if Corky got them. No, I was the

41:03.045 --> 41:26.211
one that found them, and they had our boat, and they 
were used out on the sandbar, and I was down there

41:03.045 --> 41:26.211
with my 410 foot cows across on the other side that 
belonged to Hulbert, and I hit them with these

41:03.045 --> 41:26.211
birdshot 410, and I tell you right now, I come 
around that and I saw those naked, old naked girls

41:27.254 --> 41:37.384
and boys out there, and I'd hit the fan, and they'd 
throw it up on them, just eating the devil out of

41:27.254 --> 41:37.384
them. And I want you to know they went off without 
their clothes or anything. They got going, but in a

41:41.088 --> 41:43.411
hurry. I can see you doing that. Yes. I said, next 
time you come around here, you'll know that old...

41:45.433 --> 41:51.619
What did I call myself? Don't use that word. Oh, 
aye, old dirty Sally is right here with her

41:54.305 --> 41:57.511
shotgun. She'll get you every damn time you come 
around here naked. Oh, I was mad. That's

42:02.341 --> 42:03.804
wonderful. I can see the whole scene. That's just 
like you saw right down there, but they were out on

42:07.231 --> 42:14.826
the beach, out on that sandbar, and I just passed 
through thunder out there. Okay.

42:17.862 --> 42:42.756
now you see we came right down this road all the way 
yeah from the gate from the gate yeah and i'll show

42:17.862 --> 42:42.756
you where we run into the oh it's okay now what do we 
have here camping and is this oh hamilton's

42:17.862 --> 42:42.756
hamilton's pool down here no i've never really 
been to hamilton's well that's what it is you go in

42:17.862 --> 42:42.756
around over here and shoot i never wanted to swim 
there too maybe we could go Well, to me it was too

42:43.394 --> 42:45.778
dangerous to swim there. It's a very dangerous 
place to dive in. It's not bad to swim in, but to dive

42:48.102 --> 42:53.011
in, yeah, too many people. You'll lose one a year. 
This weekend will be the weekend. Never fail. But

42:58.733 --> 42:59.874
that's where it is. That's Hamilton Pool. Okay, 
now if I met you at the ranch, I would just hit 71,

43:01.196 --> 43:13.811
take the road to Hamilton's Pool, and then come on 
across the crossing and up to the ranch. That's

43:13.951 --> 43:15.713
very easy. Very simple. We'll do that sometime. 
Here we go with those post seaters again. Now

43:22.401 --> 43:23.422
that's a tree. That's Right here's where a man 
drowned. Ran off that thing and drowned, yeah.

43:30.301 --> 43:31.683
About two foot of water. And here's where you go in 
the Hamilton Pool, right here. Yeah, okay. You

43:35.428 --> 43:37.711
know how to get out here to Hamilton Pool? Yeah, I 
know how to find it from 71. Well, there's no use in

43:39.293 --> 43:41.556
us to go. No, we can go back. We can turn around and go 
back. Because this is always 71. We're almost to

43:45.201 --> 43:47.404
Oak Hill. Yeah, and we can turn around. So we can go 
back. Okay. You know that. This is old Myer's

43:51.851 --> 43:53.413
place. Oh, really? This is where old Marvin 
Krueger lived with that woman for so long. She had

44:03.631 --> 44:05.534
that barge called Little Marvin. Oh. Oh, yeah. 
This is where they lived. I see. I think she wound up

44:10.622 --> 44:12.405
in the hospital. Insane asylum. Oh, well. This car 
is not there now. We can make a turn around here.

44:20.447 --> 44:21.868
That's what we're going to do right now. Quills for 
sale, Laura Myers. I bet they're high. We ought to

44:27.755 --> 44:29.957
go in and try something. Yeah. Handmade dominoes 
for sale. Capitalizing on Hamilton bull crap.

44:40.268 --> 44:40.408
Mm-hmm. Edith Meyer, Dripping Springs.

44:49.666 --> 44:58.435
You know, Ava, I think I mentioned that there is a 
woman who lived out here, an old woman whose father

44:49.666 --> 44:58.435
was a physician. And she lives in the dog trot to 
this day.

45:07.591 --> 45:11.858
Her father built a very old one. As I said, he was a 
physician and he was in the Civil War. And

45:16.104 --> 45:22.074
apparently she's supposed to be very vivid in her 
stories and her quilting. But I'm going to have to

45:22.094 --> 45:28.243
check with the quilting club in Austin and catch 
her name again and see if we all know. I bet you do.

45:29.826 --> 45:31.268
I'm right, but I don't know. Yeah, we'll find out. 
Anyway, I want you to get over and talk to Mary this

45:33.595 --> 45:37.704
week. Have I used up all your tapes? No, I've got 
some more. Yeah, okay. Because we're doing a good

45:41.933 --> 45:43.877
deal on tapes today. No, I've got some more. Okay. 
Now, the sun's about to drop down, so we'll have not

45:48.530 --> 45:53.037
too bad a drive back. No, it won't be too bad now. But 
I wanted to be sure that you knew how to get out to

45:54.539 --> 45:58.505
Hammonds Pool. I do. That's good. Hamilton Pool 
and Hamilton Pool is just no way up to the ranch.

46:04.453 --> 46:05.034
It's perfect. And any time you want to come up 
there, well, then I can meet you down there. Oh,

46:08.018 --> 46:09.360
that's an easy way to go. Yeah. Because this is just 
barely 25 miles, right? That's right. Sure. Yeah.

46:16.431 --> 46:17.372
That's good. Take a picture of Little Bull. Right, 
definitely. You know it to me. You know their

46:23.605 --> 46:24.927
voices. Those old bellers just sound good to me. 
I'm going to play this tape back, and we're going to

46:29.153 --> 46:31.817
listen to that later. Your doctor boyfriend said, 
my God, what kind of woman is that? I intend to let

46:41.351 --> 46:43.674
him hear that part of the tape first. I've decided 
that when I get back... That's what I'm going to do.

46:51.928 --> 46:53.210
I'll just tell him to. I'll set it up and say, why 
don't you turn that tape on and see what's on that

46:53.771 --> 46:57.175
tape? We'll have a little bull. Right? The sun 
through that theater is a fine lacy looking thing,

47:02.343 --> 47:06.388
isn't it? It is pretty. Then you can't tell me that 
you don't blow the hill country. Oh, I love the hill

47:13.858 --> 47:15.000
country. That's a Boy Scout camp. I see. It's a big 
one. Scout ranch. That's a nice one. Yes, it is.

47:26.380 --> 47:31.709
It's like a group of Boy Scouts are having a big 
weekend.

47:31.729 --> 47:34.354
Ava, what's this little plant with that delicate 
flower here? What are these? Oh, that's bee weeds.

47:36.974 --> 47:37.555
Bee brush. Bee brush. That's bee brush. Yeah. They 
smell sweet, don't they? They sure do. Make the

47:43.368 --> 47:44.812
best honey in the world. Ah. That's bee brush. Bee 
brush. Got it. Yes, ma'am. Isn't this pretty?

47:54.028 --> 47:56.871
Yeah, a mixture of red oak, cedar. There is a sumac 
and several other trees in here. This is a

48:02.136 --> 48:05.119
pretty... That's wild plum right there. Yeah, 
that's some wild plum. My gosh. Yeah, a lot of

48:08.903 --> 48:11.646
foliage you don't usually see except close to the 
river. Now right there is catfish. See that little

48:14.889 --> 48:16.891
house back there? Catfish Cattle. Old Dr. 
Cattle's fishing camp. Oh, is it? Mm-hmm. All

48:21.535 --> 48:23.657
right, now there's possum grapes. Yeah, I was 
going to ask you, that's a grape. That's called

48:25.639 --> 48:26.740
possum grape. Yeah, that's called possum grape. 
Okay, I see that when I run. There was an

48:29.603 --> 48:31.785
apple-looking thing back there. What was that? I 
don't know. I didn't see, but that was possum

48:34.607 --> 48:36.529
grape. I was looking to see. That's a Mustang. 
Mustang, yeah. You can see them there. But I

48:42.174 --> 48:43.976
recognize the possum grapes. And you know what 
that is? No, that spiderweb-looking thing. What

48:46.438 --> 48:46.939
is that? Yeah, that's Old Man of the Mountain. Old 
Man of the Mountain. Yeah. Okay. The old man of the

48:54.495 --> 48:56.437
mountain. Yeah, a fuzzy, fuzzy plant. Mm-hmm. You 
know, I tell you,

49:00.682 --> 49:09.473
they may not, all of the names that I give you may not 
be. They're regional names in a lot of cases. Yeah,

49:11.535 --> 49:11.836
mm-hmm. But that's significant because. I wonder 
if they're going to get out of the way or if I can,

49:13.598 --> 49:18.884
there's no way I can get by. Mm-mm. Ever

49:22.353 --> 49:31.142
see the cartoon character Miss Piggy?

49:31.162 --> 49:33.264
Oh, my goodness, people. Move, move.

49:39.150 --> 49:43.895
Oh,

49:39.150 --> 49:43.895
I'm telling you. I got down the bottom of that 
wagon, hid my head, and squalled. Nobody will ever

49:47.739 --> 49:48.800
know. I'll tell you for sure. This was a scary 
crossing. Now, when you crossed here, where were

49:53.772 --> 49:55.698
you headed? To Austin? Sure. Uh-huh. That's what I 
thought. This would be it. Whoa.

50:06.835 --> 50:09.400
Oh, Lord. Yeah, I can see coming down off of this. 
This is the worst place that you've ever hoped to

50:10.843 --> 50:14.570
see in your life, coming down this thing. Yeah, in a 
wagon. In a wagon. How'd your team take it? Well,

50:17.937 --> 50:21.344
they took it, but it wasn't. Uh-huh. Son of a gun. 
Can't make it this far. I hope I can get by him.

50:38.037 --> 50:41.061
because I don't like the looks of them. This is 
pretty country. I walked all the way down our

50:44.645 --> 50:47.849
river. Oh, you did? Down to here. Right down that 
river. I wanted to see what it was like and where the

50:51.754 --> 50:57.901
fishing was good and where it wasn't. We had the 
best fishing of any of it, so I didn't ever bother

50:57.921 --> 51:03.468
myself to come back. Right. Well, that's right. 
What do you usually catch? What's a fish for? Just

51:07.242 --> 51:10.648
blue cat. Well, I caught a good many. I have caught a 
good many white bass down here in the early spring.

51:21.170 --> 51:24.919
There used to be, you see this road right here? Used 
to be to go right straight to the ranch, but we've

51:25.340 --> 51:32.037
got some people who moved in here from San Antonio. 
They bought little five acre blocks of land and

51:32.057 --> 51:38.352
they locked the gates so you can't get in that way. 
And we keep our gates open so people can go back and

51:38.332 --> 51:42.577
forth. Oh, sure, sure. That was the tradition. 
That's changing. Oh, yes, that's changing. The

51:46.482 --> 51:48.204
oncoming of real estate. Yeah. People, you know, 
get five acres, they say, stay out, this is my

51:49.365 --> 51:55.112
property. Shit. If they had anything worth it, 
you'd think it'd be different. Yes. Yeah, the real

52:02.621 --> 52:06.125
estate market has taken a cut into the ranch land up 
here. Well... This old man from Houston, he said,

52:08.909 --> 52:13.334
oh, you just have a mint there. If you just cut that 
up on top of that bluff right down to that river, you

52:13.354 --> 52:22.304
have everybody access to the river and all this 
kind of stuff. Well, I said, I enjoy that river. I

52:24.727 --> 52:28.291
need to ice mine just as much as it could be. I mean, 
just as much to me as it does to you, brother. I hope

52:31.155 --> 52:34.418
that your family keeps that land. I hope they do, 
too. Again, I don't know what'll happen, but I

52:38.086 --> 52:43.634
just, the thought of you giving it up. No, no, I'm 
not going to do that. Have you ever been with me down

52:46.398 --> 52:49.142
to Mama's Place? No, that was another place we need 
to go. I'd like to go to Mama's Place and your Mama's

52:51.266 --> 52:58.697
Place and do another tape and let you tell me more 
about that, too. It's a nice piece of land. That's

53:02.222 --> 53:04.665
where Grandpa Chapman lived. That was. And he was 
happy there. You bet I was happy there. I grew up, my

53:09.311 --> 53:15.580
grandmother and grandpa were just as sweet as they 
could be. And I grant you that I was spoiled, but I

53:16.702 --> 53:26.197
was made to mind. And I'd hear Grandpa get up in the 
morning. First thing he'd do is build a fire in the

53:30.803 --> 53:35.973
cookstove for Granny to cook breakfast. But he 
would make him a hot potty. Oh, he would. The first

53:39.179 --> 53:40.241
thing. And I'd hear him in there doing it. And I'd 
jump out of that bed, and I'd trip in that potty. And

53:47.054 --> 53:50.717
he'd fix me a hot toddy. Of course, it wasn't much, 
but he'd fix it for me. And I'd sit there and drink it

53:54.001 --> 53:58.044
and smack my lips just like he did. Say, ooh-wee, 
that's good, Popo. Ooh-wee, Popo, that's good. I

54:03.329 --> 54:04.350
called him Popo. And I don't know. Now, those to me 
are really happy memories. Oh, of course. And then

54:11.657 --> 54:14.580
Granny would get up. I'd finally get my clothes on. 
Grandpa would help me tie my shoes and things. I'd

54:20.165 --> 54:21.207
get my clothes on. She'd come in and always had hot 
biscuits. And let me tell you, Cynthia, just as

54:25.093 --> 54:31.422
regularly she made hot biscuits, she'd let me have 
a little one. piece of dough to cook on top of the

54:32.060 --> 54:35.825
stove. Oh, Ava, my mom used to let me make little jar 
lids. Yes, sir. I'd get a jar lid and make myself

54:40.150 --> 54:44.336
little tiny biscuits. I'm telling you, that was 
the happiest time that ever was, and the little

54:44.696 --> 54:51.124
things that you wanted to do. Oh, how nice. Yes, it 
was nice. That indulgence was so fine. Yeah. And

54:57.490 --> 55:04.698
then she'd ask me, and I'd say, I want some ham. We'd 
go to the smokehouse, and we'd cut a big chunk of ham

55:04.738 --> 55:08.842
out. And she'd make red-eye gravy, and I'd eat 
red-eye gravy and ham. And she'd ask for one egg. I

55:14.509 --> 55:19.975
said, no, I didn't want any egg, just red-eye gravy 
and ham. And I'd eat red-eye gravy and ham. And I

55:22.477 --> 55:24.720
really enjoyed it. Mm-hmm.

55:28.355 --> 55:32.546
I haven't had any good ham, though, in a long time. 
This old ham that you buy has got so much embalming

55:32.566 --> 55:38.582
fluid that it don't even taste like ham. I know it. 
Most of the boons do. That's a shame, too. You know,

55:44.927 --> 55:51.318
in the co-op that I'm a member of, there's a ranch 
called Yaega Farms that's not putting any

55:44.927 --> 55:51.318
preservatives in their beef. They're raising 
their stock at some of their land passes, and

55:51.979 --> 56:00.995
they're doing everything without feed that has 
anything in it. Yeah. Everything is being done the

56:02.477 --> 56:05.162
hard way. You know, not the fast, easy way, but the 
hard way. That's what it amounts to. Well, that's

56:09.688 --> 56:11.850
what it really is. When I was in Arkansas, I stopped 
to buy some animals, $8 a pound. Whoa. That's

56:16.716 --> 56:19.099
coastal Bermuda that they've got planted out 
there. Yeah, I thought that was. This is Ranch Road

56:20.421 --> 56:21.462
962. Yeah. Now, those are elms, aren't they? Those 
are just plain old black, just plain old black

56:25.748 --> 56:30.994
elms. No, the trees. Oh, yeah, those are elms out 
there. They're big elms, too. Like I grew up in my

56:36.091 --> 56:37.874
front yard. Yep. Pretty.

56:42.620 --> 56:42.841
Uh-oh. Look at the geese. Aren't they pretty? 
Yeah. That's geese. Yeah. Who? Mr. and Ms. Knazey.

56:54.718 --> 56:54.918
Mm-hmm. I've just got to back up and say hello to 
them. Oh, we should.

57:03.871 --> 57:04.512
Go on. When we lived at Stonewall, and even after we 
moved to Johnson City in 1912, we had only looked

57:05.217 --> 57:21.740
forward to every month there would be a Jew peddler 
that would come through the country peddling his

57:05.217 --> 57:21.740
wares. Now, there were times, maybe this time, he 
would bring hardware, and the next time it would

57:22.181 --> 57:30.853
be... merchandise and the next time it would be 
groceries. But we would buy our groceries in large

57:36.576 --> 57:40.281
quantities. I don't understand and I really can't 
figure it out. I know that we would buy our flour in

57:44.908 --> 57:50.395
barrels of 100 pounds. And it would last from one 
time until the next when the peddler would come

57:50.611 --> 57:55.156
around. Why, you can't buy a five-pound bag now 
that the weevils won't eat it up. I know. I remember

58:02.605 --> 58:05.929
my mother put bay leaves in it. In the flower? In my 
flower, in her flower. But we never had a weevil,

58:09.373 --> 58:15.741
and we didn't eat it up that fast either because we 
only had... flour bread for breakfast, and the

58:16.244 --> 58:20.209
rest of the time is cornbread. And I know that. But 
anyway, our little Jew peddler would come by, and

58:22.872 --> 58:28.098
he would take anything in this world we had for 
trade. But he would always make it to our house to

58:28.659 --> 58:36.588
spend the night, because my mother was a very good 
cook. And he enjoyed eating with us. Now, it didn't

58:39.972 --> 58:42.235
make any difference about exactly what we had to 
eat. He was a gracious person and he was very

58:44.969 --> 58:50.596
grateful. I remember one morning my mother said, 
well I'm awfully sorry but we have no meat for

58:51.197 --> 59:00.651
breakfast and we have crud or gravy. He said, I've 
never heard of that. And we had biscuits and gravy

59:04.878 --> 59:10.605
and scrambled eggs. And I'm telling you that Jew 
peddler says, well, I never have eaten Crider

59:12.287 --> 59:25.283
gravy, but I'll tell you one thing, Mrs. Johnson, I 
believe I could do a day's work on just the bread and

59:12.287 --> 59:25.283
gravy. And I know that I've eaten enough cried to 
gravy to flow the battleship, but it's still good

59:26.191 --> 59:32.342
to me. But anyway, that day, he had a stove, and we 
had the same stove up in the boyhood home, and it he

59:47.960 --> 01:00:17.241
would demonstrate he had a little tiny model on the 
back end of his hack and he would demonstrate how

59:47.960 --> 01:00:17.241
the smoke would come out only through the pipe and 
it wouldn't smoke around you know so many of our

59:47.960 --> 01:00:17.241
stoves would smoke in those days you couldn't buy 
this stole anywhere else only through a jew

59:47.960 --> 01:00:17.241
peddler and he would he would take however much you 
had to pay now if you could pay as much as fifty

59:47.960 --> 01:00:17.241
dollars down on it uh He would give you a polon, 
which was something special, a gift of some kind.

01:00:25.785 --> 01:00:34.556
And he gave my mother a tea kettle that sat down 
right next to the fire, just like they have in the

01:00:25.785 --> 01:00:34.556
boyhood home. Now, I don't remember Aunt Rebecca 
ever owning one like that. but my mother owned one

01:00:39.361 --> 01:00:42.090
just exactly like it. And it would sit down right 
next to the eye where it would get hot much quicker,

01:00:42.713 --> 01:00:52.105
and it would be flat.
