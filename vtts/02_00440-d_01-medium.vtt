WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.094
equate that to careerism. Short tours, I don't 
know why they had short tours.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.349
And several people had several tours over there. I 
don't think that a lot of them wanted to go back a

00:15.730 --> 00:19.915
second time either.

00:24.921 --> 00:29.447
It just was, as I said before, there was nothing 
There didn't seem to be anything to gain by being

00:31.992 --> 00:35.564
there. You felt like you had your hands tied behind 
your back.

01:07.902 --> 01:13.869
I don't think that

01:07.902 --> 01:13.869
our heart was in the war. We had no motivation for 
the troops, and no end in sight. You got to Vietnam

01:23.661 --> 01:28.386
right after we invaded Cambodia. Oh, I was there 
when we invaded Cambodia. Well, we were still in

01:30.229 --> 01:31.710
Cambodia. Oh, when we invaded. We invaded in May of 
70, according to this. You didn't get there until

01:38.395 --> 01:40.957
June of 1970. Were you in on the invasion plan? Are 
you talking about before we sent the Air Force over

01:45.081 --> 01:49.324
there? Yes, but I mean before we sent, we didn't 
send any ground troops, I don't think, until I got

01:49.344 --> 01:53.688
there in the May half. Or maybe it was just before I 
got there.

02:02.776 --> 02:03.436
It may have been. You may be right. Well, as far as 
the camp,

02:22.203 --> 02:23.726
I thought it was pretty successful. I really did. 
Air Force had a problem because we had all these

02:25.509 --> 02:33.542
temples and things that we weren't supposed to 
bomb. And we had to send out pictures of all of them

02:33.562 --> 02:38.330
and tell them you can't bomb this and you can't bomb 
that. And if you see one of these in your sight when

02:38.350 --> 02:43.338
you're on a run, you pull out, you don't do it. 
Because we were afraid of the cultural.

02:51.363 --> 02:56.467
trying to protect the cultural items that were 
there. Temples, most of them are temples.

03:01.172 --> 03:06.816
Buddhist temples and statues and that kind of 
thing. Well, of course, this is that whole

03:06.836 --> 03:12.541
conflict between culture and war. And what was 
your opinion? Well, I didn't see any reason to

03:16.865 --> 03:20.188
destroy it. Of course, the Vietnamese, if they 
knew that, they'd just go get in the place. But

03:27.591 --> 03:48.758
I think we broke up their playoff, in a fair 
speaking.

03:48.778 --> 03:50.580
Did you get much time off in Saigon? I didn't go to 
Saigon,

03:52.484 --> 04:02.117
but once or twice.

04:02.137 --> 04:05.902
Because you were working too hard or because you 
just didn't want to go? I just didn't have time.

04:13.332 --> 04:17.918
And that was to visit. the headquarters of the 
Special Forces for briefing one of them, I was

04:18.421 --> 04:24.388
relieved. I never made a... I never made a visit for 
pleasure that downtown was going down while I was

04:26.671 --> 04:32.118
there. I had no desire to go anywhere.

04:37.684 --> 04:39.486
I went there for Special Forces briefing.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.555
And I went there to... for a...

04:50.028 --> 05:07.749
A guy who had worked for me through

04:50.028 --> 05:07.749
training Air Force was out of the service and was 
over there working for some commercial

04:50.028 --> 05:07.749
airline. And he invited me over to his house once. 
And that's the only time I was there. Now, one of the

05:14.177 --> 05:19.984
problems in Vietnam by 1970 is that the US Army 
reported that 50% The enlisted troops in the Army

05:21.787 --> 05:25.311
were using marijuana. Did you have any problems 
like that in the Air Force? Yes. We had problems

05:29.515 --> 05:32.378
like that, and it wasn't as large as that.

05:37.103 --> 05:40.547
I don't think we had it near that size of a problem. 
We did have a problem

05:40.567 --> 05:45.512
there. I wasn't as familiar with that as I didn't 
get much information on that except the staff

05:48.803 --> 05:54.632
meeting. What did the Air Force say about it at the 
staff meetings?

06:00.741 --> 06:15.823
Well, there was a problem and they had a screening, 
they had a urine screening test they were getting

06:00.741 --> 06:15.823
done, but they left to go home and treated them if 
they needed to. Occasionally

06:18.149 --> 06:32.891
they would catch one and court-martial

06:18.149 --> 06:32.891
him. But apparently marijuana was very easy to 
come by. Especially in downtown

06:37.718 --> 06:42.165
Saigon. I was wondering about something else. In 
the United States, by, of course, the invasion of

06:44.761 --> 06:58.397
Cambodia, Kansas State, and all these things in 
the summer of 1970, and even before there, there

06:44.761 --> 06:58.397
was a growing anti-war protest movement in 
America. Did that have an impact on the war?

07:09.831 --> 07:10.752
Well, that's hard to say. Because I don't know what 
impact it had on the soldiers or the airmen or

07:12.031 --> 07:20.020
whoever was over in uniform, the individuals. 
What about as far as you were concerned, the

07:20.040 --> 07:22.823
Tanzanute? Did it ever have any impact? You must 
have read about these things. Oh, I read about it,

07:26.708 --> 07:31.293
and we saw it on television. But

07:31.313 --> 07:41.785
I am so conservative that I resented it. And I 
thought the people were unpatriotic.

07:52.406 --> 07:56.292
I still do.

07:56.312 --> 08:01.300
And I don't condone it in any way, shape, or form. 
It's just foreign to my nature. And what did your, I

08:06.768 --> 08:11.535
mean, you must have seen these things on, I didn't 
realize you Well, it was Armed Forces TV. It's a

08:14.980 --> 08:26.614
closed circuit there that they had on, they put on, 
they run

08:14.980 --> 08:26.614
them on Armed Forces TV. They had a closed circuit 
television. I guess you could get the things over

08:28.637 --> 08:37.909
to somewhere. I guess it must have a video tape. 
Sure. I could be out of date, but it would be more up

08:42.177 --> 08:49.366
to date in the newspapers.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.129
You must have seen this with other officers. Did 
you ever discuss this with other officers at

08:52.209 --> 08:57.116
Tansanoo? Oh, yeah. What did they have to say? They 
felt like I did.

09:04.925 --> 09:11.914
There may be a reason for stopping the war, but that 
was not a good reason.

09:23.150 --> 09:28.195
Of course, we had all sworn to upheld the 
Constitution and obey the Commander-in-Chief.

09:28.415 --> 09:29.436
Sure. We felt like they should, they

09:29.456 --> 09:34.841
should too. Wow. I know your opinion has been on 
some of these controversial issues.

09:42.548 --> 09:43.989
You stayed there for six months. Were you happy or 
sad to leave?

09:50.415 --> 09:52.937
Well, of course, you're always happy to leave a war 
zone. I would have liked to have stayed a little

09:53.373 --> 10:15.161
longer. I didn't...

10:25.452 --> 10:37.127
I felt like I could contribute some more, but if it 
felt like somebody else could contribute more,

10:25.452 --> 10:37.127
that's fine.

10:37.147 --> 10:39.730
And when you left, did you think that we were going 
to win that war?

10:42.914 --> 10:43.936
No. I didn't see any way we could win it. Unless they 
turned us loose, turned the Air

10:47.580 --> 10:54.309
Force loose. Probably could have obliterated 
them.

10:59.236 --> 11:02.239
And all that. That might have stopped it. No matter 
what. They weren't going to lose today. Did you

11:08.765 --> 11:12.488
resent the fact that they weren't going to let you 
use your full force? Yes.

11:20.035 --> 11:20.316
Sure did. Okay, you left there in January of 1971. 
And you retired at the end of that year. And you just

11:29.223 --> 11:41.420
made Major General a year before, but before we 
talk about why you retired, I'd like to talk about

11:29.223 --> 11:41.420
your last duty assignment. It was only 10 months 
from January 71 to October 71. You were the

11:47.588 --> 11:49.711
assistant to the commander. I can't read that. 
Aerospace Defense Command. Aerospace Defense

11:53.296 --> 11:54.878
Command. That's out in Colorado Springs. Oh. What 
did you do out there? Well, I was the assistant to

12:01.570 --> 12:21.219
the commander, and we

12:01.570 --> 12:21.219
manned the

12:01.570 --> 12:21.219
command post in Cheyenne Mountain. And they had 
charge of all the air defense and all the monitor.

12:25.265 --> 12:27.048
The tunnel, the one underneath the mountain? 
Yeah, in Cheyenne Mountain. And we monitored all

12:28.808 --> 12:37.998
the space objects, the whole space program, 
everything in space. We kept track of everything.

12:40.721 --> 12:42.183
That must have been pretty interesting. It was a 
new command, something totally new for you. Well,

12:45.887 --> 12:47.889
no, I'd been in air defense before. But, I mean, 
monitoring that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was a

12:51.193 --> 12:55.778
completely new experience.

12:58.019 --> 13:05.767
We kept count of all the space garbage and 
everything that was in space. So to keep up with

13:05.787 --> 13:08.670
what the Soviets had and what we had. Yeah, 
everything. Kept up with everything in space. And

13:13.494 --> 13:19.260
monitored from monitoring tracking stations all 
over the world. Had big radars over in England, up

13:19.280 --> 13:27.148
in Alaska,

13:19.280 --> 13:27.148
and out in the islands. and down in Florida, we've 
been in several more big ones all over the world.

13:34.702 --> 13:46.220
All that information's funneled in, and it's all 
computer-handled, and you can pick up the

13:34.702 --> 13:46.220
situation at any time. At the commander's 
position, you can pick up the situation all over

13:46.240 --> 13:53.912
the world of what's going on in space. command and 
control system set up, alternate command and

13:56.339 --> 14:10.455
control for

13:56.339 --> 14:10.455
the Air Force. It's a real interesting mission. It 
is fascinating.

14:21.787 --> 14:27.558
big appreciation for what all is going on in space 
because there's a lot more going on than I had any

14:21.787 --> 14:27.558
idea of. For example? Just all the different, all 
the garbage that's up there, and they wait until

14:29.502 --> 14:41.045
they all burn out before they stop tracking

14:29.502 --> 14:41.045
them. All the so-called spy satellites? Yep. I've 
seen some of the pictures that we have of Cuba and

14:44.585 --> 14:53.817
some other parts that we've taken on satellites, 
and I'm always amazed. Well, they have high

14:54.959 --> 14:57.302
resolution cameras. And did you analyze those 
pictures or did you send them out to? Oh, the

15:02.850 --> 15:05.814
intelligence people do that. Did you send them out 
to DIA? Well, they go through intelligence

15:08.237 --> 15:10.139
channels. I don't know where all they are. through 
the Defense Intelligence

15:14.656 --> 15:19.702
Agency. Was your headquarters right in that 
mountain itself? No, the headquarters itself was

15:22.485 --> 15:28.892
down in downtown Kellogg Springs. They call it 
Camp Air Force Base, which is just the compound of

15:28.912 --> 15:35.920
the building. Inside the mountain, what do they 
have? pretty much the command post for air defense

15:39.243 --> 15:44.790
in case of an attack? Yes. That's where the Army 
anti-aircraft

15:47.373 --> 15:56.825
and missiles are controlled from there. That's 
where Commander Norrand, that's his command

15:57.186 --> 16:02.893
post. Commander North American Defense Command.

16:13.820 --> 16:16.242
Why did you only stay there for 10 months? I retired 
to get into this business. Why did you? So in other

16:22.369 --> 16:26.032
words, you just made major general. Do you think 
there was a possibility for another promotion?

16:30.457 --> 16:39.065
Well, I was getting close to my retirement date, 
and I doubted I'd get promoted before my

16:30.457 --> 16:39.065
retirement date. When was your retirement date? 
Was it 73 then? No, I had constructive service on

16:44.262 --> 16:48.849
top of what I had. It was probably 72.

16:56.061 --> 16:59.807
So you didn't think that you'd make Lieutenant 
General?

17:07.988 --> 17:13.116
I guess I found my level of incompetence, that's 
what they say. Find your level of incompetence and

17:13.176 --> 17:17.062
quit. Incompetence. Now, why did you retire? To 
get into this business. And did you have an

17:22.851 --> 17:27.278
opportunity to take over this business at that 
time? Or did you build this from the ground up? I

17:30.544 --> 17:32.246
mean, you were explaining before. My uncle had 
this company.

17:37.688 --> 17:45.801
He offered myself and Bon Jackson, another man who 
had been working for him for 40 years.

17:48.565 --> 17:52.331
So we were in the process of buying him out. And this 
man decided he wanted to retire too.

18:05.448 --> 18:06.990
And also R.C.' 's son-in-law owns some stock. And 
L.H. bought that stock from the son-in-law. And

18:17.045 --> 18:24.877
then after Mr. Jackson retired, we bought his 
stock.

18:24.897 --> 18:30.345
And then we decided to let this other guy in, and 
we're selling some stock to him. There'll be three

18:30.365 --> 18:32.248
of us in the bed. You had pretty firm plans about 
civilian life. I didn't until this came. He had

18:42.107 --> 18:48.857
called me to come visit him in August, and I retired 
in November. You had spent an entire career in the

18:48.877 --> 18:52.803
military. What were your feelings when you 
retired? Well, I was a little sad, but I was looking

19:04.375 --> 19:10.983
forward to a new career, a new challenge. I 
certainly got it. But we built the company up, the

19:14.207 --> 19:27.884
three of us, from

19:14.207 --> 19:27.884
a relatively small volume up to a much larger 
volume of business. I don't know if we're making

19:28.624 --> 19:34.011
any money or not, but we're getting a lot of work 
done, a lot more work done. And we've gone from

19:35.054 --> 19:38.279
about 50 employees up to 135. So

19:40.362 --> 19:48.294
we feel like we've made some progress.

19:56.526 --> 19:58.129
It hasn't all been easy, though. Some of the jobs 
have been terrible. We just hope we have enough

20:01.173 --> 20:04.318
good jobs to offset all the terrible ones. Now 
let's talk about how people advance in the

20:05.682 --> 20:08.887
military. You went, you had many advancements, 
and I'd like to know your opinions on some of these

20:09.508 --> 20:19.143
questions. Do people advance in the military 
because, in general, because

20:19.744 --> 20:30.981
being at the right place?

20:38.504 --> 20:40.306
Well, I think it's a combination of both. The job 
that you do is very important, and it's written up

20:40.426 --> 20:47.595
as such. But what was it? You also have to say, what 
was it that he did? What was the

20:55.264 --> 21:06.418
level of this accomplishment?

21:12.068 --> 21:22.040
And if you get a good job, and you do a good job, 
you're more likely to get promoted than even if you

21:12.068 --> 21:22.040
do an outstanding job and a poor job.

21:36.757 --> 21:39.780
And you're in competition with your peers. I guess 
a lot of it depends on

21:40.638 --> 22:00.356
how well your boss can cite your accomplishments.

22:00.376 --> 22:10.105
And then a lot of it depends on who gets to read your 
file on the promotion board because it's an

22:00.376 --> 22:10.105
enormous number they have to look at and how they 
rate them. And the system they have, I think, is

22:10.743 --> 22:14.948
quite fair. But all you can look at is the guy's 
picture and what's written on paper. That's all

22:21.757 --> 22:25.541
you have to do, unless you happen to know him 
personally. But does that help, knowing somebody

22:25.562 --> 22:28.765
personally? Does that help? It might help, and it 
might hurt. Well, if you did a good job. Yeah. If

22:37.085 --> 22:43.034
you've done a good job for someone sitting on the 
board, that will help. But it's very unlikely that

22:43.054 --> 22:51.787
the guy that you know will even see your record, 
though. When you were in the military, did you

22:52.188 --> 22:56.755
consider yourself ambitious?

22:59.699 --> 23:01.722
Relatively so, yeah. I was highly motivated, and I 
guess that means ambitious. I wanted to succeed,

23:07.612 --> 23:09.074
yes. Did you want to, when you were a younger man, 
did you want to become a general? Yes. That was

23:15.364 --> 23:17.167
always my goal.

23:20.913 --> 23:31.329
Now, does someone become a leader in the armed 
forces in a similar way that they become a leader in

23:20.913 --> 23:31.329
professional or in business life? Now, you had 10 
years here of experience in

23:39.235 --> 23:54.612
successful because of the same, I mean,

23:39.235 --> 23:54.612
do you get ahead the same way in this last 10 years 
that you did in the previous almost 30 years? Well,

23:55.333 --> 24:03.402
I haven't exerted as much leadership in this 
business as I did in the military, in no way, shape,

23:55.333 --> 24:03.402
or form.

24:04.803 --> 24:07.386
Because I wasn't I didn't exert as much leadership 
when I came in this business, and certainly not as

24:08.311 --> 24:14.238
much as I do now. And I've gotten a reputation in the 
business so that now I have been given a position of

24:15.760 --> 24:27.313
leadership in the industry. But as far as the 
company is concerned,

24:28.754 --> 24:37.204
it's been different. As far as leadership is 
concerned, do you leave people, your workers

24:39.412 --> 24:45.398
here, like leave them in the military? No. Can you 
tell me the differences? The people here are not as

24:50.764 --> 24:54.848
motivated.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.138
It's very difficult to get people now who really 
want to work. They want a position with a salary,

25:05.419 --> 25:08.102
but no work. And the few old-timers that we have 
left are the only ones that really want to work and

25:09.938 --> 25:17.968
do work. And the younger people work when they want 
to.

25:25.578 --> 25:28.282
That's the way it appears to me. So you think it's 
easier to wait in the military than it is out here in

25:28.302 --> 25:32.027
civilian life? Yes, very definitely. Do you think 
the ranking system has anything to do with that?

25:41.292 --> 25:43.134
No, because you have a ranking system. Sure. 
You've got workers, then you've got foremen, then

25:43.895 --> 25:54.488
you've got superintendents, right on up the 
ladder.

25:54.508 --> 26:04.279
It's very difficult to motivate workers when you 
have just a few workers at each place and you're

25:54.508 --> 26:04.279
scattered all over East Texas.

26:07.617 --> 26:14.146
And you're so dependent, so dependent on the 
people under you. And they, of course, are not

26:14.166 --> 26:16.289
highly trained. Sure. Most of them haven't even 
finished high school. What duty station did you

26:22.158 --> 26:28.647
like the most in your military career?

26:28.667 --> 26:29.768
From what standpoint? From a duty standpoint? 
Yeah, which one did you like the most? Which one did

26:33.313 --> 26:36.578
you find the most satisfying? Maxwell is common on 
the squadron officers because I get more

26:37.182 --> 26:44.032
satisfaction out of that. Do you think that that's 
the place that was your greatest accomplishment?

26:49.661 --> 26:50.121
Perhaps.

26:53.086 --> 27:00.677
I feel like I made a contribution to a lot of young 
Air Force officers. I helped them

27:00.697 --> 27:06.666
get us a comprehension of where they wanted to go 
and what they wanted to do.

27:17.027 --> 27:25.324
What about one that you thought was the least 
contribution?

27:25.344 --> 27:27.068
That was much more of a frustration.

27:43.703 --> 27:44.884
I was perhaps Korea.

27:52.814 --> 27:56.839
Very frustrating.

27:56.859 --> 27:56.939
Why?

28:05.090 --> 28:07.112
Didn't seem like we had a mission.

28:12.728 --> 28:13.970
I mean, you don't have a mission.

28:18.556 --> 28:31.613
We did have a mission, but it really wasn't much.

28:31.633 --> 28:35.378
Some people have said that there's a military way 
to do something.

28:39.374 --> 28:42.899
And you read about this every once in a while in the 
paper. Is there a military mentality or a military

28:43.019 --> 28:50.770
mind, in your opinion?

28:50.790 --> 28:52.052
Not as a category, no. You'll find in the military 
as diverse as the same as if you own that, even that,

28:54.135 --> 29:00.003
if you live in Australia. You can have

29:01.004 --> 29:06.732
hard-headed, obnoxious people in the military 
and you have part of obnoxious people in civilian

29:07.437 --> 29:13.725
life. And I don't think that you can lay all that on a 
military mentality or a military mind.

29:28.645 --> 29:36.735
I think by and large the people in the military that 
I've known is the same as people outside of Some

29:37.137 --> 29:39.141
guys get ahead and some guys don't. Some guys are 
motivated and some guys aren't.

29:46.594 --> 29:47.596
Okay. Let's go to leadership. We sort of talked 
around leadership, but we've never really

29:48.578 --> 29:52.224
defined it. Would you define it for me? What's 
leadership to you?

30:05.791 --> 30:16.786
Well, I would define leadership as getting people 
to do in a willing way what you want them to

30:05.791 --> 30:16.786
do and like it.

30:22.754 --> 30:25.438
How do you do that? I wish I knew all the answers.

30:30.185 --> 30:31.967
Well, you've got to create the desire first. Once 
you've created the desire, then the willingness

30:34.529 --> 30:39.234
follows.

30:42.378 --> 30:45.682
And they do what you want them to. What kind of 
values do leaders have? I'd say as diverse as you

30:49.286 --> 30:52.930
can find. There are so many different leaders. 
Types of leaders. Types of leaders that have been

30:56.294 --> 31:03.102
successful that I would not attempt to put them in a 
mold.

31:07.115 --> 31:16.988
Eisenhower and MacArthur were poles apart, 
personality and motivation and everything else.

31:27.082 --> 31:34.952
Winston Churchill is another completely 
different person.

31:35.012 --> 31:35.653
He was a great leader.

31:57.402 --> 32:05.150
patent for all his faults, I thought was a great 
leader, because he got the people to do things

31:57.402 --> 32:05.150
willingly. Accomplishments where he did some 
things that I think were atrocious.

32:13.479 --> 32:14.119
For example? He slapped a soldier down in Italy.

32:19.505 --> 32:22.608
He wheeled around with pearl-antle pistols on his 
belt. Showmanship. But He was highly respected by

32:27.254 --> 32:28.856
his men. They may have hated his guts, but they 
respected him and they willingly did what he asked

32:30.797 --> 32:36.503
them to. What kind of leader were you?

32:43.330 --> 32:49.155
Well, I tried to lead by example.

32:49.175 --> 32:56.923
I

32:49.175 --> 32:56.923
always had people about me that that

32:57.123 --> 33:07.237
wanted to do what I wanted them to do. The success I 
had, of course, was due to their assistance. So you

33:14.848 --> 33:18.753
thought that one aspect of leadership was 
choosing the best amount? I think the important

33:19.775 --> 33:22.118
aspect of it. I think you'll find that most 
successful leaders pick the men that

33:22.925 --> 33:37.533
are around them. Or they find somebody that's 
there that they trust, and

33:37.553 --> 33:46.249
they get his support.

33:53.333 --> 34:00.203
I think the establishment of an esprit de corps 
within the unit is a very important aspect of

33:53.333 --> 34:00.203
leadership. You've got to have something. I don't 
care if it's a gimmick. To get them together and

34:03.407 --> 34:15.364
focusing on what it is you're trying to do. You've 
got to put the mission first. Everybody's got to

34:17.767 --> 34:19.189
know what it is. What they're trying to do is 
pretend they've been all going towards it. I think

34:26.724 --> 34:39.421
the leader's got to furnish that sort of guidance.

34:39.441 --> 34:48.012
And I think that

34:39.441 --> 34:48.012
the leader's got to know what's going on.

35:03.128 --> 35:06.172
and he gets all the help he can. We've

35:06.232 --> 35:28.304
had a lot of changes at Texas A&M over the last 20 
years, and certainly since you were there. Did you

35:28.324 --> 35:32.009
ever happen to know General Earl Rudder was the 
president? I certainly did. What was your opinion

35:33.233 --> 35:34.875
of the general? I loved the man. I knew him when he 
was football coach at John Tarleton when I was at

35:37.377 --> 35:41.522
A&M. And I saw him several times up there when I 
visited. I was still a student at A&M. I also saw him

35:49.270 --> 35:53.835
in Europe before D-Day in London. And I saw him many 
times after that when he was president of A&M. I

35:59.241 --> 36:02.785
visited there a few times and talked to him. I 
didn't see him several times. What was it that you

36:06.893 --> 36:09.476
loved about him? He was a guy that set the example.

36:23.851 --> 36:30.959
He could motivate people.

36:30.979 --> 36:34.122
And he could get people to do what he wanted them to 
do, He

36:34.675 --> 36:58.889
was a good man. A real fine person. During his years 
at A&M in 1960 there were a lot of very

37:03.818 --> 37:10.309
controversial changes that I'd like to ask you 
about. One was that they ended the mandatory

37:11.131 --> 37:21.388
affiliation with the Corps of Cadets

37:11.131 --> 37:21.388
and now

37:33.012 --> 37:40.740
I think it was inevitable, unless the school or 
university wanted to stay small. I really do.

37:46.105 --> 38:02.462
I thought the school was a closer-knit school when 
that was the case, but with the growth in

37:46.105 --> 38:02.462
population and the education requirement, I 
think it was inevitable. especially with the

38:02.662 --> 38:07.307
anti-military sentiment and so forth that's 
going, that's around. It wasn't ever. What about

38:11.512 --> 38:14.956
allowing women to go to A&M? I feel the same way 
about that. I think we've already discussed that a

38:18.680 --> 38:24.667
little, but we already have women at West Point and 
the area. I think society has changed and the time

38:24.687 --> 38:29.433
came. What about allowing blacks to go to A&M? It 
was integrated in 1968. Well, I think it should

38:35.002 --> 38:39.826
have been done before that.

38:39.866 --> 38:43.250
We had Puerto Ricans, we had Mexicans, we had 
everything else. I think qualified students

38:45.352 --> 38:53.399
should be allowed, regardless of race, color, or 
creed, anywhere.

38:53.419 --> 38:58.845
I was wondering about the drought, your ideas 
about the drought. Do you think we should

38:58.865 --> 39:01.407
reinstitute a drought? I think we owe it to 
universal suffrage, not universal suffrage,

39:02.652 --> 39:16.472
but universal military training or equivalent, 
peace corps or otherwise. But I think it would

39:17.774 --> 39:27.048
restore some semblance of discipline to this 
country. It's gone to pot in my opinion now. All our

39:32.285 --> 39:39.912
mowers are relaxed, so we almost have nothing. 
We're degenerate, almost degenerate. If we're

39:43.095 --> 39:47.839
not degenerate, we're damn near that right now. 
And you think that by inducting men into the

39:47.859 --> 39:51.783
services of health hands? You teach people a 
little self-discipline, at least some, and make a

39:51.803 --> 40:00.891
contribution to society. A lot of them were never 
made.

40:06.028 --> 40:15.118
What about drafting, or in your universal 
military system, what about inducting women? How

40:15.138 --> 40:18.082
do you feel on that? Well, I think the same for women 
as for men.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.931
So you think that we should draft women? Yes. I 
don't think we ought to draft them for combat, but I

40:28.141 --> 40:42.764
think we ought to draft them for support roles or 
some form of

40:28.141 --> 40:42.764
contribution to the betterment of society. I 
mentioned the Peace Corps, but the Peace Corps is

40:43.005 --> 40:46.029
just one thing. There are other things that could 
be that can be worked out.

40:57.757 --> 41:03.623
I think that they could be used in many different 
ways.

41:06.787 --> 41:24.987
But they would be forced to do this just through a 
strict discipline.

41:25.007 --> 41:27.730
I think perhaps my generation has made a mistake 
And that's the reason we have, maybe the reason we

41:28.402 --> 41:34.130
have what we have now, because we gave our kids 
everything. They never had to work for a thing.

41:39.518 --> 41:41.661
Because we had to work. We didn't want them to have 
to go through that. So you think that the parents of

41:45.246 --> 41:50.934
the 50s and 60s were too easy on their children? 
Gave them everything. They never had to work for a

41:52.836 --> 41:54.259
thing. Because they had to work so hard in the 
Depression. Well,

41:58.270 --> 42:04.237
we couldn't afford an ice cream cone now. We give 
them anything they want. I think we're feeling the

42:07.260 --> 42:12.385
effects of it. I know that

42:12.405 --> 42:27.602
even though my dad paid my tuition to college, I 
still worked every summer to make enough money to

42:12.405 --> 42:27.602
survive otherwise. He paid whatever the fee was 
for my board tuition and board, but everything

42:27.886 --> 42:36.495
else I paid for myself. I didn't have a car. I didn't 
own a car until after I got through the war. I owned

42:41.961 --> 42:43.182
half a car once. After I graduated from West Point, 
I owned half a car.

42:53.433 --> 42:57.657
I'm wondering about the recent tendency in the 
Armed Forces You sort of alluded to this, but I'd

42:57.957 --> 43:01.362
like a direct answer. In the armed forces, toward 
increasing the number of duty billets that women

43:01.542 --> 43:10.294
perform. For example, now we have women pilots in 
the Air Force. What's your opinion of that? We had

43:14.840 --> 43:16.542
women pilots in World War II. But not as many as we 
have now. Well, I know not as many as now, but they

43:20.307 --> 43:27.036
flew ferried aircraft. And now they're going into 
cruise. And there's no reason why a woman can't fly

43:29.824 --> 43:32.988
an airplane just as well as a man. They can drive a 
car just as well as a man. And there's not a gross

43:34.590 --> 43:41.498
amount of difference between driving a car safely 
and just flying an airplane. You only have two

43:41.518 --> 43:44.001
problems in an airplane. It's takeoff and landing 
that's real problems. Problem time. And an

43:50.129 --> 43:52.652
automobile, you've got it at every intersection. 
And so you support increasing the role of women in

43:53.712 --> 43:58.157
the service? Yes, I sure do. Okay, fine. And did 
you, when you were in the military, this is a little

44:00.379 --> 44:17.017
bit before the big increase of women, but did you 
have any duty stations in which you had a lot of

44:00.379 --> 44:17.017
women in which you worked? For example, some of the 
students at the schools and anything like that,

44:17.037 --> 44:22.082
there probably weren't very many women working. 
When I was Secretary of the Air University, I had a

44:22.636 --> 44:27.322
girl working for me. She was, that was in her 
fifties, and she was pretty good.

44:36.853 --> 44:43.722
What about the students?

44:43.742 --> 44:48.087
We had not had many students, girls students, 
since the time I left. female officer for? We had a

44:50.208 --> 44:52.471
few female officers, that's all. But they had not 
started going to the...

45:01.942 --> 45:02.582
Yes, they had. We got, by the time I left, we had a few 
girls come in to squadron officer school. Either

45:10.992 --> 45:18.040
that or right after I left, because I can remember 
deciding what we would do if we did get girls. How

45:18.644 --> 45:22.208
would you handle them? They played athletics and 
everything else just like everybody else. We

45:28.636 --> 45:30.418
tried to treat them exactly the same. Any 
problems? No.

45:38.527 --> 45:40.009
They're built different. Yeah, we know that.

45:46.589 --> 45:48.455
I'm at about the end of my questions. But I'm not the 
expert on your life. Maybe there's something that

45:52.668 --> 45:54.413
I've missed. Maybe there's something about your 
career

46:33.907 --> 46:37.492
Well, I think we got off base, and we tried to do all 
things for everybody.

46:40.677 --> 46:52.936
Trying to correct inequities of centuries of 
abuse by legislating the money to do it, and that

46:40.677 --> 46:52.936
one helped one bit. I think it's already been 
proved that it hasn't helped. It may have helped

46:57.263 --> 47:00.588
some individuals financially, but that's all. It 
hasn't helped.
