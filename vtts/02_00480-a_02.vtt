WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:10.280
So then in 1930

00:03.170 --> 00:10.280
you went to the Air Corps Technical School and you 
stayed there for a year? No, it was less than that. I

00:13.164 --> 00:14.766
think it was only about six months. Okay, okay. And 
what did you learn at the technical school?

00:21.015 --> 00:21.836
Armament. This is the munitions, guns, bombs, 
sights.

00:30.760 --> 00:37.089
Everyone back then was supposed to have a 
specialty, but he wasn't required to stay in it as

00:30.760 --> 00:37.089
they are now. Mm-hmm. I didn't actually get back 
into my specialty in the war until the war came.

00:44.178 --> 00:44.319
Mm-hmm. And I wish I hadn't then, but go ahead. And 
then in 1931, you were transferred to Hawaii?

00:50.747 --> 00:51.468
Something like that. Yeah. Okay, you were 
assigned to Hawaii. To a bomb squadron, a tactical

00:57.016 --> 00:59.059
unit. Mm-hmm. And how long were you there? Three 
years. And you were, what were you doing,

01:03.865 --> 01:06.128
training? I was the squadron engineering 
officer. Generally speaking, the whole deal was a

01:10.315 --> 01:13.460
training deal. Sure. You were training for war, of 
course.

01:20.912 --> 01:21.953
You didn't see any war. I'll illustrate. When I 
first accepted my regular commission. I had a

01:29.234 --> 01:30.856
commission leave and went home. And my father took 
me on a roundabout that he was going on, but

01:32.138 --> 01:46.060
introduced me to a man that he knew who was a retired 
Army colonel who'd spent 30 years in the service,

01:32.138 --> 01:46.060
retired and was an office manager for a firm. So we 
sat and talked about it, and I said, I was by no means

01:46.921 --> 01:54.272
sure that I wanted to stay in the service, as I told 
you. And I said, The purpose of the military is to

01:54.983 --> 01:59.230
have a war, and I don't see any prospect of a war. And 
he said, son, I was in the service 30 years, and from

02:01.153 --> 02:08.685
time to time things looked mighty bleak. It looked 
like we'd never have another war, but I was in three

02:08.705 --> 02:11.710
of them. Well, he didn't think it was funny. I did. I 
still do. Things looked mighty bleak.

02:23.367 --> 02:25.730
That is sort of like that. We were training, and as 
it turned out, we didn't realize how well we were

02:25.750 --> 02:32.218
trained.

02:34.922 --> 02:44.655
People who had to accept much, much higher 
responsibilities as a rule turned out pretty

02:34.922 --> 02:44.655
well. So you were in Hawaii then, training from 
1932 to 1935. At this time, Japan was moved in 1931,

02:52.190 --> 03:03.339
moved against Manchuria, and were you out there or 
the people out in Hawaii worried about Japanese

02:52.190 --> 03:03.339
expansion at this time? Do you remember if that was 
a concern then? Yes, it wasn't a great concern of a

03:07.923 --> 03:12.587
second lieutenant. Yeah.

03:16.030 --> 03:16.831
But I remember it. In fact, yes, I remember it, and I 
remember Even more, a couple of incidents of a

03:22.312 --> 03:38.867
Japanese that I've happened to run into, well, in 
the Big Island of Maui, for example, one night, a

03:22.312 --> 03:38.867
goddamn near riot, anyway, the fierce hatred 
between the Japanese and Chinese. You see,

03:39.347 --> 03:50.277
another thing about it, which I might add, for 
whatever it's worth, the islands were largely

03:50.864 --> 03:54.007
populated by Japanese, Chinese.

03:56.970 --> 04:13.145
And of course, the originals, but

03:56.970 --> 04:13.145
no one there trusted the Japanese

03:56.970 --> 04:13.145
because of this feeling that this thing that none 
of us really believed would happen. I certainly

04:13.165 --> 04:14.787
didn't. I didn't really think it would happen, but 
nobody trusted them. Now, this was unfair.

04:21.762 --> 04:29.831
because as you know the history of the Japanese 
units and the war and what happened, it was quite

04:21.762 --> 04:29.831
unfair. And the internment on them was quite 
unfair. But it was part of the deal. Back in the

04:38.381 --> 04:43.147
United States at this time, we had of course the 
Great Depression. Did the Great Depression have

04:43.547 --> 04:47.892
any impact on the military? Not much. Don't get me 
wrong, I knew about it. My sister, for example, and

04:53.882 --> 05:00.311
her husband suffered under it quite a bit. They 
came out of it, but the props fell out from under

05:00.331 --> 05:04.376
them. But it didn't affect us much. Oh, to be sure, 
there were certain things, the strictures on the

05:10.865 --> 05:19.917
military, we couldn't We had no money to pick up 
fuel. We had to go where the fuel was and we couldn't

05:22.973 --> 05:27.080
go, that sort of thing. And oh hell, when I went to 
Hawaii, that was at the time the banks were frozen.

05:36.734 --> 05:36.995
Sure. And I had no money to go on, and when I was 
ordered to go, I had to go. There was a tailor that I

05:41.561 --> 05:48.251
bought uniforms from, and I was bitching about 
this. I was going to have to make it some way. And he

05:51.503 --> 05:53.124
said, how much money you need? And I told him about 
what I thought it'd take to get to California. And

05:57.088 --> 06:01.832
he reached under a pile of cloth and got the money 
and gave it to me, and lent it to me. He had been

06:01.852 --> 06:03.633
warned that this was going to happen. He'd gone 
over to the bank and drawn out a roll, a bill that

06:03.693 --> 06:06.736
big. And of course, we were ordered to do things and 
didn't have any per diem. These were, as it were, at

06:16.965 --> 06:20.768
our own expense. Honestly, that wasn't a handicap 
compared to what was going on in the civilian

06:21.052 --> 06:27.121
economy. I see. Not at all. I was told, for example, 
at one time I had to cut my, I couldn't fly more than a

06:29.124 --> 06:35.973
certain number of hours a year. Sure. So I went to a 
senior officer and I said, look, I'm going to fly

06:36.855 --> 06:41.361
more than that because I'm ordered to. And he said, 
don't bother with it. Just keep track. Just keep

06:47.770 --> 06:49.573
your copies of your orders. And when I ran up 
against the deadline of the number of hours,

06:50.431 --> 06:54.956
nobody said a word. I went ahead and flew as 
ordered. Presumably, somebody else didn't fly to

06:58.859 --> 07:02.683
that limit. I don't know. But these things are 
picky. The Depression didn't really hurt. What it

07:12.233 --> 07:16.557
did do, however, of course, was fund some elegant 
construction, Randolph, Hamilton Field,

07:17.313 --> 07:30.108
beautiful places, and Maxwell, which couldn't 
possibly have been built except for that money. I

07:31.289 --> 07:42.122
want to point out that the country sure got a lot for 
that money, the construction quality. those

07:43.334 --> 07:56.509
projects were just simply unbelievable compared 
to what you get nowadays for 15 times the amount of

07:43.334 --> 07:56.509
money, but let's drop it.

07:56.529 --> 08:05.640
Now one aspect about the military during the 1930s 
was that advancement was real slow. Yeah. Did that

08:09.558 --> 08:12.422
Did that have any impact on you? I mean, did it make 
you- Bother me a bit. Didn't bother you? No. You

08:17.290 --> 08:20.054
see, the whole thing was on a seniority basis. And I 
reckoned that if I was lucky, that I'd retire as a

08:20.816 --> 08:25.603
major. If I wasn't, I'd retire as a captain. I 
didn't worry about that. The hierarchy, the

08:32.073 --> 08:33.996
structure, occasionally was bothersome because 
you'd get some old fud that wasn't worth a goddamn

08:34.786 --> 08:52.974
who nevertheless held the rank to give orders but 
almost invariably some way would be found to get

08:34.786 --> 08:52.974
this man out of the way and go ahead about your 
business. I could illustrate that but there's no

08:55.178 --> 09:00.606
point in it. Okay, 1935 you left Hawaii and you went 
As a flying instructor, you were assigned as a

09:03.490 --> 09:11.458
flying instructor to the Air Corps Advanced 
Flying School, and you were there for the next six

09:03.490 --> 09:11.458
years from 1935 to 1941. Well, what happened was 
this. The war in Europe got people realizing

09:15.823 --> 09:24.051
that our forces were not big enough, and 
particularly the Air Force wasn't. I was ordered

09:24.852 --> 09:26.153
away. As a matter of fact, I was ordered to the 
engineering school at Wright-Patt. That's an

09:31.999 --> 09:32.940
advanced engineering school for the Air Corps, a 
pretty high level aeronautical engineering

09:33.747 --> 09:43.978
deal. And I was on my way to Wright-Patt, just going 
by way of New York to look at a couple of shows, and

09:43.998 --> 10:03.298
was having breakfast in the club on my way to 
Wright-Patt to find a place to live, when a

09:43.998 --> 10:03.298
classmate of mine came in the club, had breakfast, 
sat down, and said, Are you going? I told him,

10:04.429 --> 10:06.912
ordered up. He said, well, no, you're not.

10:11.097 --> 10:13.420
Back then, the New York Times used to publish 
orders. It was so small that it was news. So he

10:17.205 --> 10:24.434
backed pages of the New York Times, Lieutenant 
Kennedy orders, and so forth, canceled. And I had

10:24.454 --> 10:27.498
been ordered up there once before. And the 
commander, Kelly, blocked those. Then this came

10:33.957 --> 10:37.061
up because we had this expansion. That's how it 
happened that I was there so long.

10:43.050 --> 10:45.814
The first part of that duty was finally- So it was 
down at Kelly. Yes. And so I stayed there. Yeah. And

10:50.601 --> 10:56.629
I went to England before we were in the war while I 
was still assigned to Kelly. But the first part of

10:56.669 --> 11:01.076
that duty was absolutely delightful. It really 
was. no comparison to it in anything I served in.

11:07.281 --> 11:07.541
Why? Why do you say that? Well, because you were 
instructing in a system which is long, long since

11:08.463 --> 11:16.955
outmoded. You got assigned a group of students to 
yourself, and you could work with them for their

11:18.277 --> 11:31.977
individual characteristics, what they were.

11:32.767 --> 11:36.692
you were given a lot of latitude in your duty. And 
furthermore, every four months a class

11:37.753 --> 11:46.725
graduated, and we'd have about two weeks when we 
didn't have a class there. And the line was full of

11:46.745 --> 11:52.533
airplanes, and you could go get one and go any 
goddamn place you wanted to. And I did. Also, we had

11:56.318 --> 12:01.204
a hunting and fishing camp down in Mount Agorda. In 
the first part of it, we frequently didn't fly in

12:02.399 --> 12:07.406
the afternoons. And our night flying was set aside 
so that you knew when that was. And you could take

12:13.213 --> 12:18.540
off at noon and go down there and fish or hunt and 
come back at night. And it was a very pleasant life.

12:24.528 --> 12:27.071
We were congenial. All the guys that were doing 
this kind of work liked it. If they didn't, He

12:31.762 --> 12:40.150
didn't have to do it, and it was far and away the most 
pleasant service I ever had. As time went on and the

12:40.991 --> 12:51.942
war came on in Europe, it was not that much fun 
because it was a night and day job all the time. I'm

12:53.584 --> 13:01.752
not criticizing it because it was still good work, 
but you had to formalize it. This is the nature of

13:02.423 --> 13:04.305
things. You had to put in a production line in order 
to get it all done. And you couldn't deal with the

13:08.190 --> 13:11.314
individuals as you could before. You could as best 
you could, but it wasn't the same. Also, I was

13:18.402 --> 13:27.553
taking out a good deal and a lot of part of it to do 
other work, field location boards and that sort of

13:18.402 --> 13:27.553
thing.

13:30.183 --> 13:34.689
How good was the training that you gave the pilot 
cadets? I don't think there were any better pilots

13:34.909 --> 13:40.577
in the world than what we had during that time. Mind 
you, there are no better pilots in the world right

13:41.078 --> 13:45.684
now than the U.S. Air Force. Possibly the 
Israelis. They use the same system. But man for

13:50.991 --> 13:56.959
man, they're probably about as good as we are. They 
don't have as good an Air Force. I didn't mean that.

14:01.081 --> 14:10.790
No, but that, see that old system couldn't turn out 
the number you needed. Right. And I don't think

14:13.432 --> 14:17.395
there are any spots on the pilots. We turned out 
back then, they were the best. And we didn't just

14:21.659 --> 14:26.623
turn them out for the Air Force, we turned them out 
for the airlines too. Yeah.

14:32.502 --> 14:35.545
No, I don't have any, I don't have doubts about 
that. I'm not being just prideful of my service. I

14:38.188 --> 14:40.551
think this is an objective point of view. I think we 
proved it. And what type of training did you

14:43.034 --> 14:46.318
yourself offer? Well, my, you mean additional 
being a flying instructor? No, what, I mean, were

14:54.787 --> 14:57.430
you... instructor for the bombers or for the 
fighters? Most of the time I spent in the bomb

15:00.867 --> 15:05.171
section.

15:09.556 --> 15:15.081
I was about to tell a story but it won't illustrate 
anything so I'll get off it. Most of the time it was

15:16.843 --> 15:18.265
bombers. We got the castoffs from the Tactical Air 
Force. As the Tactical Air Force got through with

15:22.769 --> 15:27.754
an airplane, we got it. So generally our airplanes 
were old, but they were pretty reliable. I want to

15:34.401 --> 15:36.323
be explicit about this. They weren't worth a 
goddamn as combat airplanes. This was an

15:40.970 --> 15:45.396
oversight on the part of the Air Force that went way 
back. We didn't get good combat airplanes until we

15:46.798 --> 15:50.303
were in combat. But they were good airplanes.

15:57.192 --> 15:57.893
For example, I trained for a while with a thing 
called a B-18. That was a two-engine bomb, a great

16:04.131 --> 16:06.655
big goddamn thing. It was a good airplane. It 
wasn't worth a damn as a combat airplane. The first

16:16.749 --> 16:27.424
airplane that would have been in any way worthy as a 
combat airplane, we didn't even get it as a

16:16.749 --> 16:27.424
trainer, was a B-10. And the B-17, as it came out 
originally, was a hell of a good airplane, one with

16:29.328 --> 16:36.841
a dam as a combat airplane.

16:39.966 --> 16:48.681
I'm a bit prejudiced in this because, as I told you, 
my specialty was the combat mechanism of the

16:39.966 --> 16:48.681
airplane. And that's the part that was so long 
overlooked. And much of this had to be repaired in

16:51.726 --> 16:55.032
the stress of war. But as flying machines and as 
pilots, there

16:57.138 --> 17:05.932
weren't anywhere in the world any better. And we 
got foreign students. I trained a number of

17:07.856 --> 17:10.400
foreign students when I was at Kelly. Where were 
they from, England? No, South America. South

17:14.627 --> 17:15.829
America, okay. Now during this time, during the 
mid-1930s,

17:23.108 --> 17:28.154
According to Chenault's memoirs, have you ever 
read Way of the Fighter? Who? General Claire

17:29.816 --> 17:32.319
Chenault, have you ever read his memoirs? I'm 
sorry I haven't, I knew him. He stated that the Army

17:35.563 --> 17:52.643
Air Corps overlooked the potential of fighter 
airplanes and that there were a group of bomber

17:35.563 --> 17:52.643
generals who ran the show and those people thought 
that heavy bombers could never be attacked and

17:52.943 --> 18:05.499
would always be able to withstand any kind of 
anti-aircraft fire, and therefore we didn't need

17:52.943 --> 18:05.499
fighters, and we usually trained people in 
bombers. What did you think about the use of

18:07.321 --> 18:12.007
fighters versus bombers? Chenault was dead 
right. Improved it. See, I'm not aware of the book.

18:22.441 --> 18:24.183
I don't know why, but anyway, I haven't read it. But 
I'm well aware of this particular contention on

18:25.344 --> 18:29.910
his part because I was there. He left the service 
because he couldn't get anybody to listen. He was

18:35.416 --> 18:38.880
absolutely right, and the war proved it. The 
problem, the fundamental, the basic problem is

18:41.703 --> 18:48.651
still with us.

18:51.601 --> 18:52.842
I don't want to wade into that. The best man you can 
talk to about that is Bernie Schreiber.

18:59.428 --> 19:01.430
What did you think of Chenault? You said you knew 
him. Look, he was an instructor at Brooks when I

19:03.311 --> 19:08.155
went through here. And, oh Christ, that guy could 
fly better than anybody, but anybody except a few

19:08.175 --> 19:21.507
of his contemporaries were just as good. I 
remember, just to illustrate, they had a

19:21.790 --> 19:34.808
competition about who could make the landing more 
accurately with a goddamn PT, primary trainer.

19:36.430 --> 19:44.281
And Brooklyn, they named the field after him, 
Chenault, who the hell was the third one? He's dead

19:44.301 --> 19:46.004
too, so it doesn't matter. Anyway, they marked the 
place just over the helm and the airplane had to

19:50.967 --> 19:53.931
come down just like this. And so, you know what a 
campaign hat is? We used to wear them, a big goddamn

19:59.299 --> 20:02.624
thing. Chenault put his hat down there and the 
tailskid of the airplane was a marker. Chenault

20:09.974 --> 20:16.444
came in and put his tailskid on his hat. Gee whiz. I 
remember, for example, sitting by the stage

20:20.583 --> 20:21.925
house. There was a stage house. There's a thing 
straight up in Brooks Field, out in the field. And

20:26.771 --> 20:28.193
then there was a crapper over here. It was a pretty 
big one. And we'd sit around there and fly from that

20:30.716 --> 20:35.443
place because it was more convenient than the 
hiring line. But this morning the fog was in low and

20:36.204 --> 20:42.252
we were just sitting around there and here come 
three airplanes. And I don't know which one of them

20:42.272 --> 20:48.700
was leading, but he had convinced the other three, 
the other two, that they couldn't get between the

20:50.198 --> 20:56.005
crapper and the stage house, but they did. They 
overlapped their wings and did. That's the kind of

20:59.869 --> 21:01.491
people they were. And Chenault, as you may know if 
you read his book, I'm sure he told you, he designed

21:01.511 --> 21:12.404
the fighter tactics that were used. And he had a 
flying circus up there at Maxwell. He had one at

21:15.647 --> 21:18.771
Kelly for that matter. But what he was trying to 
tell these guys was the same thesis that I'm

21:19.561 --> 21:30.173
telling you, that goddamn airplanes weren't 
worth a crap for combat. And they were great to fly.

21:34.017 --> 21:44.129
See, the big bomber guys thought that they could 
fly over the flak, but damn it, anybody that knew

21:34.017 --> 21:44.129
anything about German munitions knew goddamn 
well they couldn't. And the British tried to tell

21:44.709 --> 21:47.172
us that.

21:50.206 --> 21:56.212
Of course, there was one point I want to make in 
which logic did prevail. And I say this because I'm

21:57.774 --> 21:59.956
familiar with that too. I flew an observation for a 
time. This is a two-man airplane in which one guy

22:06.222 --> 22:10.987
does the observing and the other one doesn't. And 
we realized in time that that could not survive.

22:17.003 --> 22:25.313
And the mission, which observation had had, was 
scrubbed and went into fighters as

22:17.003 --> 22:25.313
reconnaissance. That's what you call it now. So it 
wasn't a total loss situation because the Air

22:28.657 --> 22:44.496
Corps people didn't have sense enough to realize 
that that thing that they'd been doing so long,

22:28.657 --> 22:44.496
which the Army thought was great, couldn't 
survive, and they didn't stay with it. The painful

22:45.708 --> 23:03.715
part of it was getting all this munitions onto the 
airplane, which people wouldn't, goddammit, no

22:45.708 --> 23:03.715
matter what you said, they wouldn't design it onto 
the airplane.

23:05.277 --> 23:14.871
I remember too well the time when a fighter guy 
would look to see whether or not the baggage

23:05.277 --> 23:14.871
compartment would carry a stick of It's golf 
clubs, and it's B4 bag. That's all he was

23:18.333 --> 23:19.475
interested in. He didn't give a damn about the 
guns. What you want to do and what you must do in a

23:22.219 --> 23:30.652
weapons system is start with what you're going to 
do with the goddamn thing. That's all Chenault was

23:30.672 --> 23:32.514
trying to tell people. And trying to tell them 
things that were perfectly obvious, but they

23:34.417 --> 23:39.004
wouldn't listen. They still don't. Why do you 
think they would not listen? I can take it out of

23:44.213 --> 23:47.877
context and explain it very quickly.

23:53.003 --> 23:56.286
They're bringing a battleship out of mothballs.

23:59.169 --> 23:59.650
You know why? The Navy loves battleships.

24:07.879 --> 24:09.160
I don't want to talk about it anymore. It's a highly 
complex subject. This is the area that I mentioned

24:14.437 --> 24:20.224
a while ago, where you have all kinds of forces, not 
headed bastards to deal with. And if you want to

24:20.724 --> 24:25.910
come out with a project goal, you have to deal with 
all those things. You can't get exasperated about

24:25.930 --> 24:27.552
them. And these two men I mentioned were masters of 
it. I mean, two Aggie generals that I mentioned are

24:32.798 --> 24:36.983
masters of it. Ludeke and Shriver.

24:41.969 --> 24:42.790
God almighty. But I remember when Bernie, for 
example, was patting the halls in the Pentagon,

24:44.272 --> 25:02.761
trying to put over what he was trying to put over, 
trying to get the knotheads to go along with him,

24:44.272 --> 25:02.761
and he was just about to be shipped out to, I don't 
know whether he knew it or not, I think he did, but he

24:44.272 --> 25:02.761
prevailed. That's what it takes.

25:07.989 --> 25:09.972
Hell, let's get off that subject. Okay, let's... 
Did Chennault teach you how to fly? Oh, no. He was a

25:15.724 --> 25:20.929
stage commander, a check pilot. Did I fly with him? 
No, no. I flew with the third guy. He's here. He

25:29.076 --> 25:32.319
lives out in the country. Nick Carter.

25:40.432 --> 25:46.058
I'll illustrate, and I never had to write a check 
with Chenault, so I never flew with him, but I knew

25:40.432 --> 25:46.058
him. And you had to know people like that. God damn 
it, he was a... Let me illustrate the methodology.

25:56.089 --> 26:02.516
I had an instructor

25:56.089 --> 26:02.516
who was a hell of a nice guy. As a matter of fact, he 
was from A&M. But he fell out, and I had a series of

26:05.407 --> 26:13.377
them, and it happened at the time I was coming up for 
a check, I had a true horse's ass. And so I went into

26:13.397 --> 26:24.451
this check ride, you know, God damn, am I gonna do 
something right or not, and fiddled around, and I

26:13.397 --> 26:24.451
was about to bust it. The check ride is, you do 
things, you spin to a point, and they cut the gun on

26:24.471 --> 26:34.924
you, and you find a place to land, and all kinds of 
goddamn things, everything that you're supposed

26:24.471 --> 26:34.924
to know how to do. So this guy I was riding a check 
with just gave me uncharted hell in the air, cut the

26:35.545 --> 26:45.780
gun. There was no gospel system in it. You had to 
holler at each other. Well, I didn't lose my

26:51.107 --> 26:54.913
temper, but I did get angry. And so he gave me a force 
landing, and I just cut the gun and walked it down,

26:56.255 --> 27:04.827
mad.

27:06.157 --> 27:10.201
He says, for Christ's sake, why don't you do that 
all the time? All he was really trying to do was to

27:11.202 --> 27:15.187
get me to be natural. And he was being mean to do it. 
And Chenault was that way. But his

27:25.038 --> 27:33.767
mission, his objective was absolutely 
unchallengeable. this would work with one fellow

27:34.152 --> 27:37.255
in the woodwork or not, I don't know. I went through 
it myself later and my assessment was sometimes

27:37.936 --> 27:45.284
that's what you have to do and sometimes something 
else is what you have to do. Sometimes you have to

27:45.304 --> 27:51.171
hold the guy's hand until he learns what he needs to 
know. But I think, let's see,

28:01.388 --> 28:04.652
The two men I mentioned are not familiar with 
Chenault because they're younger.

28:07.295 --> 28:17.288
I

28:07.295 --> 28:17.288
don't know anyone alive now that can talk to you 
about Chenault in a really intimate way. What

28:17.768 --> 28:19.210
about this Carter fellow? What about Carter, this 
Carter fellow? Well, Nick

28:22.915 --> 28:29.783
lives over on the other side of town. He's a World 
War I pilot. as Chenault was, of course. He's way up

28:34.084 --> 28:35.846
in years. He's even deafer than I am, and he's a 
naturally saturnine man. If you wanted to call

28:44.053 --> 28:49.318
him, he'd talk to you, I guess, but I really 
wouldn't. Unless you're going to do something on

28:50.119 --> 28:54.463
Chenault, specifically, I wouldn't recommend 
it. I was wondering if you considered joining the

28:54.683 --> 29:01.770
American Volunteer Group that Chenault 
organized in 1941. I know that he came and talked to

29:04.656 --> 29:12.587
the President Roosevelt and Roosevelt allowed 
military flyers to get out of the service to go on a

29:12.922 --> 29:25.179
one-year leave system and sign a contract with 
CAMCO, and I was wondering if you were contacted or

29:12.922 --> 29:25.179
thought about that. Look, there's a considerable 
misconception about that. A good many friends of

29:28.944 --> 29:35.273
mine did go, so I know where off I speak. It was not 
that simple. You were given to understand in no

29:37.235 --> 29:42.102
uncertain terms that if you bought in on that you 
were through with the Air Corps.

29:49.367 --> 30:05.712
Now it didn't turn out that way because by God when 
the time came the Air Corps needed those guys and

29:49.367 --> 30:05.712
needed them bad and as you know they all formed up in 
the Air Corps but that wasn't the way it was offered

29:49.367 --> 30:05.712
nor was it in Spain. I wanted to go to Spain but you 
couldn't You couldn't go as an observer. You

30:13.124 --> 30:16.368
couldn't go anyway and still maintain. And by that 
time, you see, I had a wife and child, and I just

30:16.949 --> 30:21.475
simply couldn't afford to. There wasn't any way I 
could do that. The men that I knew that went, with

30:23.879 --> 30:31.289
one exception, were all bachelors. And the other 
one was a guy who was on his way out anyhow. Did you

30:37.094 --> 30:38.556
know some of those people? Who were some of those 
people that you knew when they became known as the

30:38.616 --> 30:42.622
Flying Tigers? Oh, let me talk about just one.

30:48.691 --> 31:05.295
He was at Kelly in pursuit, which is the fighters, 
and the third time he got lost on a cross country, he

30:48.691 --> 31:05.295
washed out and the reason he did was that The guy 
that was running the section then had said, you

31:07.942 --> 31:14.510
know, this is how you do it. This is, here's your 
map, and now this map in front of you. And he went to

31:18.214 --> 31:22.599
some damn little place down like Wharton and 
couldn't find it. Where was his map? Well, he'd

31:24.781 --> 31:25.702
forgotten. He'd put the map in his luggage 
compartment. So he washed him out. So he went to

31:31.469 --> 31:36.615
Spain on a $15,000 contract. And that was pretty 
good back then. In fact, it was damn good. And this

31:43.117 --> 31:58.239
fellow that Clyde Rich, he's here retired now too, 
showed me a postcard he got from me saying, I go out

31:43.117 --> 31:58.239
on patrol frequently and think of you on each 
patrol.

32:01.144 --> 32:05.370
Well, God Almighty, when he came home, he stopped 
off in Washington. And of course they were very

32:06.363 --> 32:11.309
anxious to debrief him because we couldn't send 
anybody. That was a very bad mistake. This was

32:14.653 --> 32:17.396
proving ground for them. I still regret it. But we 
couldn't. That's all there is to it. Order of

32:21.581 --> 32:22.462
Roosevelt. So they debriefed him, but he wouldn't 
talk until the guys on the air staff agreed that

32:23.843 --> 32:35.897
they would put him back on duty. as a first 
lieutenant and send him to Kelly as an instructor.

32:45.077 --> 32:48.542
So, they had to agree to that, and they did, and he 
showed up back at Kelly. Well, when the Chennault

32:49.563 --> 32:56.173
thing came through, he took that and went. What was 
his name? Ajax Baumler. A-J-B-A-U-M-L-E-R.

33:00.439 --> 33:04.485
Yeah, I've heard of him. He's a soldier fortune 
type. Anyway, he did a damn good job for Chanel.

33:10.395 --> 33:16.203
When it came time to escort, for example, some of 
those hot shot guys didn't like to do that. Ajax was

33:16.283 --> 33:22.951
there and he did his job and he ended up as an ace, of 
course, but he's all right. He's the only man I ever

33:25.094 --> 33:27.837
turned in for a flag violation. I didn't believe in 
that because I violated the rules myself and most

33:28.758 --> 33:34.065
everybody did, but this particular day, By that 
time I had a section at Kelly, the far end, and I was

33:35.193 --> 33:52.790
responsible for the flight line on that end and my 
people, and I was taking off, there's an old

33:35.193 --> 33:52.790
railroad track going down there. Anyway, here 
comes this guy, right square in my traffic, right

33:52.810 --> 34:02.719
down the railroad track, buzzing a train. And I 
thought, God damn it. He wasn't satisfied with

34:09.225 --> 34:10.726
that. He came back head on into my traffic. So I 
chased him and got his number and turns out it was

34:16.231 --> 34:19.755
Ajax. And his excuse was he was teaching this guy 
how to attack a train. I feel, well, he didn't hold

34:28.443 --> 34:33.347
it. any ill will toward me, but I feel sort of guilty 
about it. It's the only man I ever did turn in for a

34:37.953 --> 34:40.816
while. That's the kind of man he was. But when the 
time came in combat, he was a very cool, very good

34:43.280 --> 34:48.166
man. That's one of them. Another one was a man, one 
of my instructors, who was a good pilot, but so-so

34:50.890 --> 35:02.845
as an instructor. I wasn't too sorry to lose him. He 
was good. I liked him. What was his name? Sandell.

35:09.053 --> 35:09.654
He was killed. Oh hell, I could name some more, but 
it doesn't matter. Hell, Tex Hill's out here if you

35:18.064 --> 35:20.708
want to talk about that. Did you know him? I haven't 
met him. I don't know him, no. He doesn't know me

35:25.814 --> 35:28.277
either, I'm sure. Did you know Johnny Allison? 
Yes, very well. What kind of man was he? There's

35:34.138 --> 35:37.361
only one of them. He's a cutter. He's a good man.

35:43.066 --> 35:44.487
You know his story, I suppose. I know a little bit 
about him, but... Well, let me tell a story about

35:44.788 --> 35:55.617
him which may or may not be on the record. I think it 
is, probably.

36:02.056 --> 36:07.864
You remember Roosevelt

36:02.056 --> 36:07.864
said, give the Russians. Okay, that's another 
story, and it isn't part of what you're looking at.

36:13.532 --> 36:19.882
Anyway, some Russians came in, and so Arnold was 
chief then. So he asked somebody to come up from

36:20.983 --> 36:25.389
Langley to demonstrate a P-40, I believe. Oh yeah, 
yeah. So Johnny came up and he really ran that thing

36:27.993 --> 36:31.376
out. He knew he could get away with it, normally you 
can't, but he just brought it in right over their

36:31.396 --> 36:42.005
heads and made them duck and then spiraled it up and 
so forth and made it look like a good airplane,

36:31.396 --> 36:42.005
which it really wasn't much. And so the Russians 
said, well if we're going to get that airplane we

36:43.927 --> 36:53.315
need somebody that can help us handle it. So next 
thing you know Johnny was on his way to Moscow. And I

37:00.910 --> 37:09.398
guess I was on,

37:00.910 --> 37:09.398
anyway it converged about the time I was in 
England, on my way, whatever. I don't remember my

37:09.599 --> 37:12.441
part of that particular deal. But he was there then 
and they just put him in Durham's Vial. He had a

37:18.847 --> 37:27.936
hotel room assigned, of course, and then he had a 
place out at the airport assigned, of course,

37:18.847 --> 37:27.936
where the airplanes were And they just kept him 
under guard from the hotel, the airport, back to

37:28.962 --> 37:33.309
the hotel. But he did a good job. And you may know 
about his later. He came back when the war was on.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.892
Anyway, I mean for us.

37:51.836 --> 37:56.944
Arnold called him in and told him he was to do this 
job, which I'm sure you're familiar with.

37:57.717 --> 37:59.238
commander type operation. No, I didn't know about 
this. What was this now? Johnny Olsen. Yeah, when

38:05.064 --> 38:08.768
he came back from Russia, Arnold gave him what kind 
of job? Well, it was not, the timing, there's a

38:08.788 --> 38:19.999
break in the timing, but we were in the war and they 
were going to do this operation behind the lines

38:08.788 --> 38:19.999
out there. And Arnold called him in and told him 
that he was to be in charge of the air part of it, and

38:26.422 --> 38:30.447
he could have whatever he needed. But Johnny was 
pacing the halls of the goddamn Pentagon then.

38:45.584 --> 38:46.405
Shit, I was gone. Had to be because I didn't

38:51.667 --> 38:56.214
See, when I was dealing with those people, they 
were in the munitions building. I didn't know the

38:56.294 --> 39:03.624
Pentagon was there until after I got back after the 
war, but that's neither here nor there about the

38:56.294 --> 39:03.624
story on Johnny. Nobody in the goddamn building 
knew that Arnold had told him this because it was so

39:03.644 --> 39:10.194
secret. Johnny knew it, Arnold knew it, but when 
Johnny went to get something, he didn't know

39:10.214 --> 39:15.301
anything about it.

39:18.366 --> 39:21.150
He had a hell of a job on his hands, but he prevailed. 
And what was the commando operation? Oh, hell, it

39:25.669 --> 39:33.699
was a robotic step scheme to drop people behind the 
lines, and it worked. In France? The main body of

39:35.141 --> 39:38.906
them were going in gliders. You must know the 
story. Anyway, it's in the record. I don't have to

39:42.630 --> 39:45.894
go through all that with you. And, of course, I only 
mention it because Ellison is one of a kind. He's a

39:55.543 --> 40:06.818
man that no matter what happens, no matter how bad 
it is, he doesn't lose his poise or sense of humor,

39:55.543 --> 40:06.818
which is better. You might think of him as the 
renaissance man of the air age. He's a little guy

40:15.991 --> 40:19.016
and that doesn't bother him a bit. Most little guys 
it does. Did you know Charlie Bond? Charlie Bond?

40:28.312 --> 40:28.892
Yeah, sure. You're going to talk to him.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.901
What did you think of Bond? I knew him in

40:38.643 --> 40:45.109
peculiar circumstances. He did a hell of a good 
job. He was misplaced. Bond is what they used to

40:48.873 --> 40:52.377
call a powder and shot man. He's damn good. He was in 
this, what you might call, sort of a

40:56.203 --> 41:07.579
quasi-diplomatic position and he worried about 
it and talked to me about it from time to time, but

40:56.203 --> 41:07.579
he's a damn good man. No question about that. But 
for his record, talk to him. No. Okay. That didn't

41:14.448 --> 41:15.349
hurt him any. What didn't hurt him? The fact that he 
was in an assignment which didn't exactly suit his

41:17.392 --> 41:22.039
best talents. Didn't hurt him a bit. He's a good 
man. Okay. Now let's talk about when you went first

41:26.817 --> 41:31.344
to England. Why did you go there? To help the RAF? 
No. I went there because... Oh, shit.

41:46.308 --> 41:49.133
There's no use going into the personality of this 
damn thing. I went because I wanted to. They had a

41:52.550 --> 41:54.012
war on them. Yeah, I know they went to war in 1939 and 
there were some American fliers who joined the

41:54.032 --> 42:01.421
Canadian. Yes, I know a lot of them. Did you think 
about doing that? Couldn't for the same reason.

42:10.232 --> 42:11.453
I wouldn't have done it anyhow. By that time I was 
too deeply committed to the Air Force. I did

42:16.968 --> 42:24.357
consider it on the other situation, but the terms 
on which I had to do it were really out of the

42:16.968 --> 42:24.357
question. My family responsibilities were such 
that I just simply couldn't do it. Okay, now why did

42:29.324 --> 42:31.967
they send you to England? To learn about how they 
were teaching gunners. That was the mission. And

42:41.899 --> 42:43.161
how long did you stay there? Oh, I don't know. I got 
back before the war started. I think I got there 1st

42:49.162 --> 43:00.574
of July and got back the latter part of last of 
October, something like that. 1941, so it was

43:00.594 --> 43:03.957
after the Battle of Britain then. Oh, yes. They 
were still being bombed, but it wasn't anything

43:05.519 --> 43:10.424
serious. How'd you get along with the British? 
Well, I think it's fair to say that I got along with

43:14.427 --> 43:25.423
them just like most everybody, every other U.S. 
military person did. I respected them immensely

43:25.443 --> 43:31.192
in some regards and didn't think too highly of 
their way of doing things in other regards. It's a

43:31.472 --> 43:33.796
fair statement.

43:35.338 --> 43:40.806
They're extremely good at what they're good at, 
and we're a goddamn sight better at what we're good

43:35.338 --> 43:40.806
at. In your opinion, what were they good at and what 
were we good at?

43:49.224 --> 43:55.132
The two things that the British are so much better 
than we are, the first is guile. I grabbed that word

43:57.154 --> 44:04.544
from somebody that used it on television a while 
back about the British, and I thought it fit

43:57.154 --> 44:04.544
exactly, so I'll take it.

44:09.511 --> 44:11.113
They're infinitely better at... Oh, were. Were. 
Not necessarily so now. Infinitely better than we

44:16.907 --> 44:23.072
were at intelligence gathering and assessment. 
Infinitely better. As far as flying the airplanes

44:26.315 --> 44:29.077
went, they weren't quite as good. As far as 
maintaining the equipment was concerned, they

44:30.078 --> 44:35.422
were nowhere near as good as we were. As far as their 
medical help was concerned, flight surgeon.

44:45.898 --> 44:47.040
Well, it's the best in the world.

44:50.604 --> 44:58.292
There's no country, no country that compares to 
ours with the medical attention that an airman

44:50.604 --> 44:58.292
gets. Ours is just infinitely better. And I mean 
any of them. And I've been in Europe and Middle East

45:04.359 --> 45:08.584
and God knows where not. But the British... are not 
easy to work with, and I'm sure they say the same of

45:13.615 --> 45:20.263
us, but they're good allies.

45:23.407 --> 45:36.783
The thing that one must remember, and again, I'm 
talking about then, not necessarily now, is that

45:23.407 --> 45:36.783
when there's anything that's open for grabs, the 
British are going to grab it. They just assume

45:37.524 --> 45:42.610
command without any reason to get it. So you have to 
worry about that and fend them off, as it were, when

45:43.315 --> 45:50.912
they try to take over something they have no right 
to get.
