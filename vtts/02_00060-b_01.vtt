WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:05.909
A couple of things about the court trip that I want 
to reflect on. You know, I'm trying to remember

00:06.310 --> 00:19.145
whether it was Rice or some other place. That 
freshman court trip to Houston, I assume it was

00:19.165 --> 00:22.709
Rice, because I don't even know if it was Rice. On 
Friday, we all went in three cars. But there's

00:24.719 --> 00:40.415
quite

00:24.719 --> 00:40.415
some sisters in this. This is about 35 people. And 
then there was some people from . And it was, I'll

00:41.698 --> 00:42.641
forever not know where it was. But it was somewhere 
out in the 1960s, Humboldt area. uh,

00:44.733 --> 00:57.224
house out in the family woods that this wife's 
sister and young husband lived in. And all of a

00:57.244 --> 00:58.607
sudden, 30, 50, 40 city head cadets showed up with 
him. And

00:59.043 --> 01:20.903
it

00:59.043 --> 01:20.903
was,

00:59.043 --> 01:20.903
you know, I'll never forget it, because I can't 
imagine how anyone, and these were just a young

00:59.043 --> 01:20.903
couple, probably not much older than his age, who 
found a way to feed all of us and put us all down and we

00:59.043 --> 01:20.903
slept in their house. And it was the next night 
after, the real story I want to share is, during

01:20.923 --> 01:28.510
the, at halftime, the majorette for Rice came off 
the field and grabbed the saber of the OD. And the

01:34.781 --> 01:40.146
stands, within three to five seconds, emptied. 
I've never seen, it was like a mass of humanity

01:40.166 --> 01:44.910
simply moving out of the stands. And then, of 
course, the police, and then there were a few

01:44.930 --> 01:50.976
strategic blows struck, but it didn't last long. 
But it was just, I will always remember how, there

01:50.996 --> 01:58.783
was no order given, there was no, you know, someone 
organized, it just empty onto the field. And of

02:04.118 --> 02:06.663
course, the second deck was trying to get down. But 
everybody on the first deck, which was mostly

02:06.683 --> 02:11.931
students, went out there and tried to get a 
licking. So there was always a little bit now, one

02:13.013 --> 02:25.834
other thing we haven't talked about Haskell is 
that the freshman class in the fall of 1963 was and

02:13.013 --> 02:25.834
will be forever the mascot stealing champions of 
the Southwest Conference. Oh, yes. Please do

02:31.643 --> 02:33.833
describe it. We had a young fellow who was a 
freshman over in one of the Air Force outfits whose

02:35.618 --> 02:50.374
name shall not be revealed, and a sophomore who was 
also sort of a ringleader who had planned all this

02:35.618 --> 02:50.374
out. And we had a lousy football team in a pretty 
lousy school when you think about it. So we had to do

02:57.102 --> 03:00.225
some things to distinguish ourselves. And so they 
set about to capture every mascot in the Southwest

03:00.577 --> 03:07.793
Conference. The distinguishing ones I remember 
is the one when they stole the horn frog Ended up,

03:15.697 --> 03:18.460
the Horned Frog died. I mean, this is, you know, 
there was one on every street corner in Fort Worth.

03:22.505 --> 03:25.949
It wasn't like this was an endangered species in 
those days, but this was a big deal. That was one

03:28.392 --> 03:29.132
thing. Then, of course, the final blow was when 
they stole Bevo. And, I mean, this, you think about

03:34.058 --> 03:39.484
it, this is quite a, quite a feat. How could anybody 
steal UT's mascot? I mean, I can't even imagine.

03:44.671 --> 03:46.534
But anyway, they do. And they have the mascot here. 
And it's pastured on some territory supposedly

03:50.420 --> 03:57.431
owned by J.E. Lupo. And they gather us all in Guyon 
Hall. And there's a big Texas Ranger with a hog leg

04:07.045 --> 04:12.754
on his side making a speech. And one of the ending 
remarks is, boys, I just want to remind you, we

04:13.983 --> 04:21.690
still hang horse thieves in Texas. And I want the 
damn steer back, and I want it back now. I mean, this

04:26.075 --> 04:27.556
was a big deal. And I think Rutter and Dean 
Hannigan, who was the dean of students, we were all

04:28.057 --> 04:36.545
petrified of, were on the stage. And sure enough, 
they negotiated. And I think it was probably

04:39.087 --> 04:41.830
because Lupo figured he was in trouble. But they 
did negotiate finally sometime before the game

04:42.434 --> 04:50.844
started Bevo to be handed back to the proper 
authorities. It was quite an occasion. Is this the

04:55.149 --> 05:00.916
year they got one of the Baylor Bears and on the way 
back the Bear tore up the car? They had

05:01.036 --> 05:03.379
tranquilized the Bear. And apparently, while 
they were hauling, and it was just a Cub, it wasn't

05:04.253 --> 05:17.520
really a full, but on the way back, the 
tranquilizer wore off, and they had to exit the

05:04.253 --> 05:17.520
car, and the bear just tore the hell out of the 
inside of that car. I mean, there were a lot of

05:17.602 --> 05:20.425
stories like that. The SMU, they had a little 
miniature pony, and I don't remember what it was

05:20.505 --> 05:32.257
that happened to the pony, but they had to get a 
veterinarian involved. And you know, when you

05:32.998 --> 05:40.065
think about it, you had a few faculty members 
around here that were probably in the know on some

05:32.998 --> 05:40.065
of that going on, too. But I believe they stole 
every mascot that year. Now, as far as you were

05:44.416 --> 05:47.882
aware, was it the same guys doing? Yeah. I mean, I'm 
sure all those guys must have flunked out of school

05:49.024 --> 05:54.954
after the fall semester because they could not 
have been going to class. They were spending full

05:55.816 --> 06:01.345
time planning and executing the kidnappings. Oh, 
another popular fellow on the campus at that time

06:01.325 --> 06:09.938
was the old bulldog named Ranger. We called him 
Rutter because obviously he was owned by

06:10.118 --> 06:28.986
President Rutter's family and we would paint the 
predicted score on the old bulldog's side and then

06:10.118 --> 06:28.986
we would paint the real score and I'm believe to 
this day he probably died of lead poisoning from

06:29.388 --> 06:34.073
all the paint that had been put on him. But he had 
some peculiar habits. One of the things he would do

06:35.675 --> 06:43.563
is he would roam the campus and he would walk out in 
front of your car if you were driving and wouldn't

06:35.675 --> 06:43.563
move. And then if, you know, the only thing you 
could do was let him in the car, drive around the

06:44.444 --> 06:51.913
campus for a little while, and then let him out and 
he was fine. But it was his way of getting a free ride

06:51.933 --> 06:56.037
and having some fun. One night, and this was, I 
don't know what year, but I came back to my dorm room

06:56.017 --> 07:13.165
late, opened my door, and I heard something 
snoring very loudly. And I flicked the light on and

07:14.090 --> 07:19.298
there was Rutter in my bed. Some friends, quote, 
friends, had given him a place to sleep for the

07:19.359 --> 07:24.507
night. So, you know, you just find another place to 
sleep and don't bother him anymore. Where would

07:29.555 --> 07:30.837
you have found him? Where's that other place? Oh, 
just in another, somebody else's bed that was out

07:32.340 --> 07:35.084
of town. Oh, okay. I don't even remember. Let's 
see, a general question. It just pops in my brain.

07:42.341 --> 07:49.418
In your four years as an undergraduate, do you 
remember anybody in the core area ever having any

07:42.341 --> 07:49.418
problems about theft? No. You know, I don't even 
remember locking my door. That's what I thought.

07:57.100 --> 07:57.661
And your car? No, never. You know, it just didn't 
happen. Now, we had, as I said a while ago, we had

08:01.387 --> 08:08.397
some strange characters and sort of... I figure it 
probably went like this. The judge said Army,

08:11.288 --> 08:19.302
Marines, Texas A&M, or penitentiary. And they 
ended up here as an alternative to those other

08:19.322 --> 08:22.909
places. I don't know that for a fact, but I mean some 
of the people that we had were of that ilk. But they

08:28.238 --> 08:36.267
weren't thieves, and they were just strange 
characters. Some of them you would probably

08:37.168 --> 08:38.790
remember. Some of them are very successful 
business people today. Rod Dockery would be a name

08:43.596 --> 08:49.723
that comes to mind.

08:51.695 --> 08:54.861
passionate would be an understatement. He was a 
cruel, sadistic, mean individual. I don't think

09:00.252 --> 09:07.206
he's that way today, but that's the way, and who 
knows how he got that way. But you cut a wide swath

09:07.912 --> 09:12.700
around Rod Dockery if you saw him on the campus. And 
I mean, I kind of like the guy today. As you look

09:15.544 --> 09:22.234
back, you end up being corps commander and one of 
the true student leaders of that time. During your

09:23.396 --> 09:28.544
freshman year, how did you begin to get headed in 
that direction? Were there some people, some

09:28.605 --> 09:31.489
events, some organizations? Well, you know, I 
don't know. I mean, I'm not sure I can, I can't, I

09:34.949 --> 09:44.141
don't think it's one of those things that's 
predestined, and I don't think you, I don't really

09:34.949 --> 09:44.141
think you think about it. I mean, frankly, my goal 
in life was to be company commander. I mean, that

09:49.849 --> 09:55.636
was, to me, that was the sort of pinnacle job. It's 
where you could make the most difference in terms

09:56.598 --> 10:02.185
of dealing with the kind of things we dealt with. 
What happened, though, was, you know, a lot of what

10:02.165 --> 10:08.914
you, in those days, it was built around a couple of 
things. One, you had to have the grades, which

10:09.034 --> 10:15.142
were, you know, I mean, they weren't the easiest 
thing in the world. The second thing is you had to be

10:16.303 --> 10:26.316
reasonably proficient at the military stuff, 
uniform and drill and all of that. And then you know

10:27.140 --> 10:32.868
whatever other ways you exhibited leadership, 
people had to identify and pick up on. We didn't

10:33.309 --> 10:38.136
think about it so much as because we were watching 
ourselves. We didn't realize other people were

10:38.276 --> 10:40.119
watching us too. But do you realize now that you 
caught some people's attention as a freshman? No,

10:45.567 --> 10:46.869
probably not. I mean I was best drill or best 
freshman cadet or some sort of thing. You were?

10:51.897 --> 10:52.638
Yeah. Okay. In my outfit. You know, and then you 
compete for that. But most of that's doing right

10:56.464 --> 11:00.791
face, left face, and whether your shoes are 
shining and all that kind of stuff. It doesn't have

11:00.871 --> 11:02.433
a lot to do with your leadership. And then as you go 
through the ranks, people start beginning to

11:03.535 --> 11:11.187
recognize, for example, And you know this story, I 
think. I was first sergeant of my outfit my junior

11:13.610 --> 11:17.295
year. To be corps commander, that's a strange 
route. In fact, it's only happened one other time

11:20.158 --> 11:24.003
that I know of, and that was year before last.

11:27.888 --> 11:39.503
But what's the part of that that's untold is this, 
that I interviewed for corps staff, and the

11:27.888 --> 11:39.503
process was, as a junior on corps staff, you were 
basically selected by the seniors then you had to

11:40.495 --> 12:06.840
be verified by the commandant's office and all the 
the trigon bureaucracy but what had happened was

11:40.495 --> 12:06.840
we had a grade-wise we had a very poor class i was the 
only one in my outfit that had the grades to be first

11:40.495 --> 12:06.840
sergeant we the class ahead of us was worse than us 
we had no one who had the grades to be company

11:40.495 --> 12:06.840
commander So they were going to import a person 
from another outfit to be company commander. So I

12:14.672 --> 12:17.715
said, hey, I can't abandon the outfit. We're going 
to end up with two people imported, the CO and the

12:18.595 --> 12:23.260
first sergeant. That's not going to work. So I 
basically decided to opt out of the competition

12:24.941 --> 12:36.152
for being a junior on staff to be the first sergeant 
in the outfit, which fundamentally was in keeping

12:24.941 --> 12:36.152
with my targeted objectives anyway. But what 
happened out of all that is I got exposed to some

12:40.321 --> 12:46.427
people who could see, you know, who I was. And then 
the couple of fellows that were on first brigade

12:46.947 --> 13:03.121
staff and corps staff as seniors the year ahead of 
me began to observe some behavior and stuff as a

12:46.947 --> 13:03.121
first sergeant that said, hey, this guy might be 
okay. And then in the senior year, you get put into

13:05.900 --> 13:08.506
the system to be considered. And then it was a long 
sort of crucible you went through to end up being

13:08.567 --> 13:16.767
selected. Were the selection process interviews 
started with cadets and then you ended up with all

13:22.505 --> 13:51.651
the military types including the commandant at 
that time a fellow named denzel baker

13:22.505 --> 13:51.651
dean hannigan the dean of student life or whatever 
dean of students and then the final interview was

13:22.505 --> 13:51.651
rutter but that one basically the the the 
interview with rutter was for him to just check off

13:52.171 --> 13:59.660
By that time, you'd been scrubbed so many 
different ways that it would be very rare for him to

13:52.171 --> 13:59.660
say no. In all of those interviews, that review 
process, in hindsight, what were the key talents,

14:00.541 --> 14:11.394
the key areas that they were concerned about? 
Well, I think there were two or three things. One is

14:15.059 --> 14:19.444
we had had a fellow the year before as corps 
commander who was, I didn't really know him that

14:21.145 --> 14:29.695
well, but he was the son of an Air Force officer. He 
was very, and don't forget now, we're in the

14:30.656 --> 14:35.081
Vietnam era. He was very military, but not very, 
his leadership qualities weren't all that great,

14:36.302 --> 14:48.216
and he tended to be very aloof.

14:49.512 --> 14:55.643
there were a lot of what I would consider to be sort 
of cultural negative issues in the Corps at the

14:49.512 --> 14:55.643
time. I mean, the people at the bottom were not 
paying attention to the people at the top. And I

15:02.075 --> 15:09.169
think one of the things that they were looking for 
is someone who could relate to the cadets up and

15:02.075 --> 15:09.169
down the line. Another thing was we had a... We were 
split in our living between the Duncan and Sbiza

15:13.373 --> 15:17.637
areas. We had a lot of conflict in the Sbiza area 
with the civilian students. These were kids that

15:24.823 --> 15:34.953
either started in the corps, and also remember 
this is transitioning from required corps to

15:24.823 --> 15:34.953
non-compulsory corps. And then we had a lot of 
people that were coming in in those latter years

15:34.973 --> 15:40.798
straight into the institution with no experience 
in the corps. And there was a lot of jealousy and,

15:41.318 --> 15:57.053
you know, not, I mean, it wasn't a revolution or 
anything, but there were just fundamental things

15:41.318 --> 15:57.053
like getting up in the morning and banging on the 
trash cans as you marched to chow so you'd wake up

15:41.318 --> 15:57.053
all the damn non-regs. You know, I mean, so it was a, 
and they were looking for someone who could try to

15:57.073 --> 16:08.524
manage through this environment we had, which was 
converting from compulsory corps, all military,

16:09.567 --> 16:17.518
had been very active in a lot of things that had 
corps and civilian students involved in it.

16:17.578 --> 16:24.689
Student government, ag activities, the 
journalism program, which was primarily

16:17.578 --> 16:24.689
civilians. There weren't very many corps. 
Anyway, so I mean a lot of those things probably

16:26.171 --> 16:28.554
factored in. Who knows? I mean, I don't know. why 
they made the decision as you look back do you

16:32.534 --> 16:50.712
remember because you obviously knew that you were 
being you were one of the candidates yeah is there

16:32.534 --> 16:50.712
any time when you felt hey that was a key that this 
was a key step um

16:53.763 --> 16:54.224
No. Reflecting

16:55.025 --> 17:00.835
back on it, you didn't get an air for action report. 
Nobody told you why you were selected. There were a

17:03.800 --> 17:06.284
couple of other things I would point out. We had 
about

17:06.324 --> 17:16.260
three or four people in the ROTC program that were 
young captains and majors. that were just out of

17:16.679 --> 17:29.275
Vietnam, typically, and these guys were sharp, 
they'd survived the experience, they had an eye

17:16.679 --> 17:29.275
for somebody they thought could exhibit 
leadership. One of those, interestingly, was a

17:30.517 --> 17:38.187
fellow named Charlie Zip, who was one of the more 
interesting characters I've ever known.

17:41.071 --> 17:42.012
It was rumored that Zip had married somebody rich. 
I don't know if that was true or not. I mean, I know

17:46.741 --> 17:47.903
Margaret Ann now. I don't know her well. And Zip was 
also the only guy in the ROTC that had ever had saber

17:49.585 --> 17:56.855
drill. So he was the one that taught us how to do 
saber drill. And he'd been to West Point, so he was

18:02.021 --> 18:04.845
the big dog. But he was an immensely funny, 
dry-witted guy was influential, and then a couple

18:10.325 --> 18:20.162
of these young captains who were just fire eaters 
that were influential, I think, in the decision

18:10.325 --> 18:20.162
making. Did anybody coach you about the 
interviews or anything? No, never even, was never

18:25.030 --> 18:27.454
even thought about. Did you turn to anybody for 
advice, did you? No. Right, how did you know, When

18:34.186 --> 18:41.295
did you how and when did you learn the unfortunate 
thing is you just had to be honest Yeah, you know you

18:34.186 --> 18:41.295
said yeah, they ask you questions. You told them 
what you thought right or wrong You know it's

18:41.315 --> 18:48.445
because there wasn't any there was no school for 
Going through this the interesting by the way. I

18:48.465 --> 18:55.654
told you it was something interesting my freshman 
fish camp buddy Barney fudge was the sergeant

18:48.465 --> 18:55.654
major of the Corps and So he would have been the heir 
apparent to be corps commander. That was always

19:00.810 --> 19:01.851
the route. Whoever was sergeant major the junior 
year typically was corps commander. So when I was

19:06.780 --> 19:17.760
selected corps commander, you know, you then 
chose your own staff, again, with final approval,

19:06.780 --> 19:17.760
check off by the commandant. But I asked Barney to 
be the core adjutant, which he accepted. And we

19:23.166 --> 19:34.943
still remained fast friends, which if he were the 
kind of guy that would have been sort of inwardly

19:23.166 --> 19:34.943
thinking or egotistical, he would have said, go to 
hell. I'm going to go do something else. But he

19:36.125 --> 19:36.646
didn't do it. That was your fish hole lady? No, he 
was my, I met him at Fish Camp. Remember, he was with

19:41.339 --> 19:47.346
Burke Burnett, Texas, and we became friends at 
Fish Camp, and then ended up being on staff

19:41.339 --> 19:47.346
together. Now, in those days, remember, we're 
transitioning out of all corps. We had Barney, who

19:54.814 --> 20:06.748
was the president of the student body, or in those 
days we called it president of the student senate,

19:54.814 --> 20:06.748
and sort of by virtue of that was the nominal 
president of the student body, the head Yale

19:54.814 --> 20:06.748
leader. the head of the Ross Volunteers, one and 
the same, also the head stack who built the

20:07.589 --> 20:23.097
Bonfire, the president of the MSC, the editor of 
the Agriculturalist, the editor of the

20:07.589 --> 20:23.097
battalion. Tommy got canned, so he wasn't there.

20:29.611 --> 20:35.501
Well, I mean, we had all of the leadership 
positions basically embedded in corps staff. So,

20:36.042 --> 20:44.596
you know, from a student perspective, you know, we 
were really well integrated in terms of all of the

20:36.042 --> 20:44.596
overall leadership. How were you informed that 
you had been selected as corps commander? This is

20:49.051 --> 20:51.157
an interesting story. That spring, my junior 
year, among other courses I was taking was a very

20:52.721 --> 21:04.073
difficult course called Animal Reproduction. 
and one of the uh requirements in animal

21:04.053 --> 21:27.782
reproduction was a weekly lab and one of the things 
that we learned to do in that weekly lab was to

21:04.053 --> 21:27.782
palpate cows to determine if they were pregnant 
and how far along and i probably very hard on the

21:04.053 --> 21:27.782
tape to explain the process but needless to say it 
involves putting one of your upper appendages in

21:27.762 --> 21:56.233
the rear end of a cow and i had been in this lab for 
three hours with my uniform with what comes out of

21:27.762 --> 21:56.233
the rear end of a cow placed in unsightly places i 
get back to my dorm room uh late in the afternoon and

21:27.762 --> 21:56.233
on my you know on the door there were You always had 
your name and your class schedule and all that.

21:58.939 --> 22:04.492
Well, stuck up there was a note saying, come to the 
Commandant's office immediately. Well, I mean, I

22:05.795 --> 22:12.670
didn't know for sure what it was, but I, you know, I 
was far enough along to have a pretty good idea. But

22:13.780 --> 22:17.244
I don't have a clean uniform. So I scramble around, 
and I find a uniform, but my shoes are covered in cow

22:17.264 --> 22:24.352
dung. So my junior old lady was a guy named Mac who 
wore size 13 shoes. So I borrowed Mac's shoes, sort

22:32.882 --> 22:43.534
of stuffed some stuff down in the toe, and hobbled 
my way across campus, showed up at Colonel Baker's

22:32.882 --> 22:43.534
office, walked in and saluted feeling a little 
strange and he told me I'd been selected but I had a

22:43.514 --> 23:05.100
couple more uh well no no no that was after the 
rudder interview so I was anointed about what time

22:43.514 --> 23:05.100
of the year was this um I would say it was probably 
April It was late in the year. Now they make the

23:09.043 --> 23:12.854
selections very early. But then it was probably 
within a month of the end of school. All right, how

23:17.129 --> 23:22.715
did your life change then, between then and the 
next fall, beginning of the fall semester? The

23:23.956 --> 23:34.187
first symptom was that I was, I had, and you'll love 
this Haskell, I put off taking History 105 and 106.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.011
I don't know why, but I just did. And so I was taking 
History 105 my second semester junior year.

23:48.415 --> 23:59.995
I think I had Alan Ashcraft, I can't remember, but I 
had a good prof. And I went into the corps commander

23:48.415 --> 23:59.995
selection with a high A. I finished that semester 
with a low C because I don't think I ever went back to

24:01.443 --> 24:08.174
class. And all I did was just take whatever exams I 
had to take without doing any reading, without

24:09.336 --> 24:16.528
taking any notes, and just, you know, kind of 
bombed it. So it was, it became a time of intense

24:17.410 --> 24:25.543
time commitment in terms of, you know, number one, 
it would have been a little easier for someone who

24:26.013 --> 24:36.107
was already on core staff, who sort of was, knew all 
of the issues and techniques and people. But I had

24:36.779 --> 24:47.420
to not only learn that, but I moved into an office in 
Dorm 2, which was the headquarters of the Corps at

24:36.779 --> 24:47.420
the time. Slept on a box spring and mattress on the 
floor for that last month or so, just to get over and

24:47.781 --> 24:58.703
get broken in. It was intense. Then that summer, 
you go to camp? Went to Army ROTC camp. Joe Bush, who

25:06.212 --> 25:21.490
was selected the outstanding cadet who was Class 
66, but in the summer camp in that summer of 66,

25:06.212 --> 25:21.490
later killed in the operation into Laos, as you may 
recall. Joe Bush was in the outfit next to me. One

25:25.615 --> 25:39.894
thing I do remember most about summer camp was we 
had a TAC officer who was out of a little school in

25:25.615 --> 25:39.894
Missouri, and I can't remember the name of it. But 
he was a very poised and really good guy. But he

25:47.945 --> 25:52.551
picked me out the first day and said, we've got to 
have somebody to lead the parade. Now, he probably

25:52.531 --> 25:59.042
knew of my selection down here, but, I mean, you 
know, this was a little different. This is cadets

25:59.122 --> 26:02.387
from all over the western United States. And where 
are you? Fort Sill. Fort Sill. Which, another

26:05.993 --> 26:07.475
thing. Not very far away from home. Not very far 
from home. In fact, we made a deal, and I got the word

26:10.020 --> 26:15.248
out to all the junior cadets I could find, telling 
them if they'd like to stop off in henrietta at the

26:15.228 --> 26:38.215
farm on the way up it was sort of like fish whites 
experience we had probably 40 kids spend the night

26:15.228 --> 26:38.215
with us on the way to and my dad and my mother cooked 
he cooked barbecue and she cooked corn on the cob

26:15.228 --> 26:38.215
and black eyed peas and everybody just had a 
wonderful time Let's jump back a second. When you

26:41.601 --> 26:45.990
learned that you'd been selected, how did you make 
your parents aware of that news? You

26:47.052 --> 26:57.992
know, there was one phone in the guardroom of dorm 
two, and it was a pay phone. My guess is I wrote them a

26:59.896 --> 27:01.718
letter. I mean, frankly, I don't remember. And to 
them, this was good, but they really didn't

27:04.903 --> 27:12.993
understand what it really meant. And so I don't 
really remember. Right. So you went to summer

27:16.758 --> 27:18.020
camp. Then did you go home or did you come back to 
A&M?

27:25.970 --> 27:27.372
I came back early. But I don't remember, I don't 
think I came right after summer camp. And by the

27:32.265 --> 27:34.375
way, I had, the spring of my junior year I had met my 
bride. Typical Aggie courtship. My roommate,

27:45.121 --> 27:59.485
again, was a fellow from Dallas and he and a lady 
named Kitty Hudnall, a Delta Gamma from North

27:45.121 --> 27:59.485
Texas, had been dating since high school, but it 
was one of these deals where it was on again, off

27:45.121 --> 27:59.485
again. And I was always ending up having to be the 
father confessor and the cupid and trying to keep

27:59.465 --> 28:04.690
the thing going. Well, Kitty was coming down one 
weekend, called Mac or sent a note or whatever and

28:04.710 --> 28:16.342
said, I've got a sorority friend on the rebound. 
Anybody wants a date this weekend? And that was the

28:19.385 --> 28:20.706
start. And she was from a large metropolitan area 
also, wasn't she? Marlin. Yeah. And had gone to

28:25.891 --> 28:34.527
North Texas, really following a future 
sister-in-law that she didn't know was going to be

28:25.891 --> 28:34.527
a sister-in-law at the time. They had gone up 
there. So this first date was a football weekend?

28:39.276 --> 28:40.078
Basketball. Played UT here. Can still take you to 
the very seat that I sat in behind the and it was

28:45.348 --> 28:50.997
because it was behind a girder, you know, old G. 
Raleigh White up in that northwest corner. And we,

28:51.978 --> 29:07.002
I had my corps uniform on, of course, and I had a 
ribbon, and I can't remember what it was for, but it

28:51.978 --> 29:07.002
had stripes, and so she was, We were in the back of a 
65 Mustang driving around. Mac has borrowed it

29:10.179 --> 29:12.368
from his mother and dad. And she said, what's that 
ribbon? And I said, well, I'm the core barber. And

29:17.427 --> 29:19.069
she said, oh. She didn't know what that meant, but 
it must have been important. So we played this game

29:22.654 --> 29:25.098
for quite some time. And then finally, she'd 
probably hate for me to reveal that she was that

29:25.118 --> 29:30.626
naive. In those days, either use yourself or 
anyone else as an example, if you had a special

29:31.347 --> 29:44.466
date, where did you take that special date here in 
the College Station Bryan area? There was nothing

29:44.966 --> 29:46.168
special. there weren't any, number one, you 
didn't have any money, but number two, what little

29:46.520 --> 29:50.978
you had. there wasn't a lot of places to go. You had 
all of the following. You had Zarapi's Mexican

29:55.537 --> 30:03.445
food, which was over near where, whatever that is 
now, Albertson's, I guess. You had the Werman's,

30:04.866 --> 30:13.475
downtown Bryan, which was where we went to eat the 
first time my parents met my bride.

30:16.558 --> 30:19.581
You had the chicken place, I can't remember the 
name of it. It went to South College. Youngbloods.

30:25.961 --> 30:26.502
Youngbloods.

30:29.610 --> 30:33.559
The Texan in those days was the chicken fried 
drive-in place. Ray Oldberger at the Circle.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.583
There was a greasy spoon at Northgate. But, I mean, 
you know, they were just another significant of a

30:42.004 --> 30:48.532
times and that sort of thing. We're jumping 
around. But there was a place at Northgate called

30:49.413 --> 30:51.876
Lou Ann's Restaurant. A buddy of mine, our 
sophomore year, stayed down here for six weeks,

30:53.638 --> 31:00.407
went to school, and worked. The only problem was we 
had to get by the first couple of weeks for the

31:00.427 --> 31:07.776
paycheck to come, and we didn't have anything to 
eat with. And we went to Lou Ann's restaurant and

31:08.701 --> 31:15.505
made a deal with the owner that if he would give us a 
meal ticket just to get by two weeks.
