00:07.270 --> 00:33.042
away we go this is ron shorn taping tom barnes at the 
university of california berkeley on june 8 1993

00:07.270 --> 00:33.042
uh for the record tom what's your name full name 
thomas grady barnes iii and where and when were you

00:07.270 --> 00:33.042
born i was born in columbus ohio on august 17 1944. 
okay um when did you first get interested in

00:07.270 --> 00:33.042
astronomy uh really during my freshman week when i 
was at the university of rochester i went there as a

00:33.916 --> 01:01.375
chemistry major and uh and decided that i ought to 
be sure of that so i sat down with the catalog read

00:33.916 --> 01:01.375
all the way through the catalog of majors and said 
astrophysics sounds right i decided i had been

00:33.916 --> 01:01.375
more interested in astrophysics in astronomy 
through my growing up years than chemistry so i

00:33.916 --> 01:01.375
switched majors when did you get your bachelor's 
degree 1966 from Rochester. And then where'd you

01:04.609 --> 01:06.192
go to grad school? University of Toronto. Why? I 
wanted to get, I wanted to do my work with the

01:08.876 --> 01:26.164
Invariable Stars and Don Ferney was, and still is, 
at the University of Toronto and he had done some

01:08.876 --> 01:26.164
really nice work on Cepheids, so I picked Toronto. 
Okay, and when you got there, of course, you took

01:26.431 --> 01:32.280
classes and everything, but what did you do your 
thesis on and under who? I did a master's thesis on

01:33.121 --> 01:47.322
secret galaxy variability with Don Ferny, and 
then I did my Ph.D. thesis also with Ferny on

01:33.121 --> 01:47.322
statistical parallaxes of MIRA variables to get 
the absolute magnitudes. Okay, then you get your

01:47.502 --> 01:51.148
Ph.D., and it's time to get a real job. Where did you 
go? I went to McDonald Observatory as a W.J.

01:57.197 --> 01:59.660
McDonald Fellow in the fall of 1970. How did that 
start? Did you see a notice on the bulletin board or

02:01.582 --> 02:03.985
something like that? In 1970, when I started 
making applications, the job market was really

02:06.128 --> 02:12.176
tight. I mean, it got even tighter later, but it was 
pretty tight. And so I applied for darn near

02:15.320 --> 02:19.725
everything I could find. I honestly don't 
remember where I saw the notice on it. And I don't

02:25.062 --> 02:35.192
remember that I paid much attention to it as an 
application other than I sent it in, as I did a whole

02:25.062 --> 02:35.192
lot of other ones. And then I got a call from Harlan 
Smith offering it to me in the spring of 70. And I had

02:42.239 --> 02:47.844
a couple of other things pending at that time that 
hadn't been resolved. One, for example, at the

02:48.004 --> 02:50.607
University of Western Ontario. that after 
talking with various faculty members, I decided

02:51.734 --> 03:00.405
that I would drop out of the other ones and take the 
MacDonald fellowship. OK, so your first contact

03:02.127 --> 03:04.890
with Harlan was over the telephone. But what was 
your first trip to Texas like? Actually, I met

03:09.356 --> 03:12.640
Harlan before I went to Texas. I met him at the IAU in 
Grenoble in September. August, September,

03:18.413 --> 03:21.717
whenever it was, in 1970. And I remember thinking 
when I met him that this is a character. Because

03:28.605 --> 03:33.211
every word he said about Texas was, it's the best in 
the world. I remember distinctly him telling me

03:33.391 --> 03:42.061
about the accountant at Texas, keeping the books, 
Bill Geist, and how he was the best accountant in

03:33.391 --> 03:42.061
the world. And I thought, this is really 
remarkable that everything there is the best in

03:42.241 --> 03:47.948
the world. Because it wasn't quite the way I'd 
heard it from people before I went there, that

03:48.198 --> 03:56.909
there was some concern about, well, it was kind of a 
new department, a struggling department. But

03:56.929 --> 04:01.355
they had some big telescopes and a lot of access to 
those telescopes, which is why I went. So I moved

04:01.996 --> 04:07.303
there in October 1970.

04:08.228 --> 04:13.155
The department and the observatory were still 
housed in Painter Hall, the old physics building.

04:13.356 --> 04:15.800
Right within close range of the Texas Tower. 
That's right. And in fact, this was not long after

04:16.981 --> 04:20.306
the Texas Tower incident. And that actually 
didn't give me any pause. I didn't consider that as

04:24.052 --> 04:28.579
a negative for going to Texas. It was purely an 
astronomical decision.

04:34.949 --> 04:37.172
When you got there, how? Roughly, how big was the 
department? I mean, how many staff and how many

04:39.422 --> 04:43.347
people at McDonald and the department? It's hard 
for me to remember because it was almost 23 years

04:44.228 --> 04:50.195
ago. But I suppose there were probably six or eight 
faculty, I guess, maybe 10. I don't remember how

04:58.666 --> 05:00.688
many grad students there were. The conditions in 
Painter were very crowded. We were packed into

05:06.683 --> 05:13.129
that particular building, the floors we occupied 
on that building, right up into the attic. So it was

05:14.450 --> 05:20.235
pretty crowded conditions, but it didn't seem to 
bother people, by and large. In fact, it was kind of

05:20.275 --> 05:24.599
nice in some ways because we interacted more 
strongly. Than when you're on three separate

05:24.799 --> 05:26.221
floors. That's right. What did you do when you 
first went there? Well, I went as a postdoc, and so I

05:31.586 --> 05:36.370
got an office with Bill Hubbard and... And Bruce,

05:36.687 --> 05:43.154
God, all of a sudden, I can't remember his last 
name. Josephson Junction Fellow. And I occupied

05:46.537 --> 05:51.142
the desk that Steve Little had before he left. He 
was a previous postdoc. So I started doing the

05:53.584 --> 06:06.137
program that I had planned to do, which was 4N 
hypersensitized plates of globular clusters to

05:53.584 --> 06:06.137
do VRI photometry of mirrors.

06:08.716 --> 06:34.504
okay so you're using ammoniated foreign plates 
that didn't last very long because uh i discovered

06:08.716 --> 06:34.504
pretty quickly even with the 82 inch telescope 
that i wasn't going to be able to get what i wanted

06:08.716 --> 06:34.504
out of the plates and so i looked around for 
something else to do during the the two postdoc

06:08.716 --> 06:34.504
years and i discovered that david lambert was 
working with reinhardt beer of Jet Propulsion Lab

06:34.990 --> 06:43.778
with a Fourier transform spectrometer on the 2.7 
meter, which at that time was still third largest

06:34.990 --> 06:43.778
telescope in the world. And this Fourier 
transform spectrometer was state of the art at

06:44.419 --> 06:47.782
that time. It stayed that way for three or four 
years. And it was fascinating. It was highly

06:52.307 --> 06:54.269
mathematical. They needed somebody with some 
observational experience involved. And so I kind

06:59.934 --> 07:03.057
of fell in with that group. began working FTS stuff 
for six or eight months. And then David offered to

07:07.347 --> 07:11.093
move me on to one of his grants. So I dropped off the 
fellowship. And I stayed with Fourier Transforms

07:15.280 --> 07:22.851
Spectrometry for about six years.

07:23.371 --> 07:38.491
One of the reasons I'm asking you is that you're at a 
place, and you're the assistant director now, I

07:23.371 --> 07:38.491
guess, at McDonald's, that is very heavily 
involved in planetary work, one of the few places

07:23.371 --> 07:38.491
it is, but you're not really a planetary 
astronomer, so you've got a different point of

07:23.371 --> 07:38.491
view. I mean, you know, you're not going to lose 
your grant if you tell the truth, all right? When

07:43.959 --> 07:49.446
you came to UT originally, What would you say was 
the status of planetary astronomy at that time?

07:54.003 --> 07:58.349
Was it an integral part of the department, or was it 
a big deal, or did people just suffer it to be?

08:02.113 --> 08:06.158
I think it was pretty clearly an integral part of 
the department from my perspective. In fact, a lot

08:06.319 --> 08:16.311
of the time I spent observing with that FTS 
instrument was on planets, was on Jupiter,

08:06.319 --> 08:16.311
because that was what Reinhardt Beer was 
interested in doing. We also did long period

08:17.472 --> 08:22.378
variables and some other things which were more of 
interest to me and to David Lambert. But we got

08:22.418 --> 08:34.532
tremendously great amounts of observing time on a 
huge telescope, mostly because, I'm pretty sure,

08:22.418 --> 08:34.532
because of the planetary connection of that 
program. In fact, I think my one planetary

08:36.434 --> 08:45.505
publication is I'm last author of about five or six 
on the first detection of deuterium off the Earth.

08:45.839 --> 08:49.384
which was in deuterated methane in Jupiter from 
that instrument. There was a lot of planetary

08:51.748 --> 08:57.237
astronomy going on on the 107-inch or the 
2.7-meter. I mean, Ed Barker was there doing it.

09:02.385 --> 09:03.727
There were a number of other people involved. Bill 
Hubbard was there with planetary interiors work.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.779
To me, it seemed like it was clearly an integral 
part of the program. One thing that I think is a

09:11.995 --> 09:20.945
mistake in Big and Bright, the history of 
McDonald's, is that no one who was not a faculty

09:11.995 --> 09:20.945
member at UT was ever mentioned. So that leaves out 
Heist-Binrad, it leaves out Tobio, and it leaves

09:20.965 --> 09:24.429
me. And we all, between us, got a substantial 
amount of telescope time. Was there ever any, and

09:29.776 --> 09:36.944
of course, that was because NASA said, you know, 
you've got to use, we give you the money, you've got

09:29.776 --> 09:36.944
to do it. Was there any... jealousy, rage among UT 
faculty members about us outsiders using the

09:41.223 --> 09:49.495
telescope? I don't remember any from then. I 
remember a lot of that later, but I don't remember

09:50.977 --> 09:54.542
any from then. Now that may be because I was so 
intent as a new postdoc and learning this system

09:54.562 --> 10:02.574
and getting established myself that I wasn't 
paying attention to it. I also wasn't connected in

10:03.115 --> 10:10.285
to the faculty and those sorts of discussions to 
the extent that I am today. So I may have just missed

10:10.703 --> 10:19.233
it, but I don't recall there being any anti-solar 
system stuff at that time in the early 70s. Were

10:21.516 --> 10:26.822
planetary astronomers looked down on by real, 
quote, unquote, astronomers? I mean, this is like

10:26.902 --> 10:31.047
a taranto in places like that that didn't have any 
planetary problem. Were you aware of anything

10:31.067 --> 10:32.849
like that? No, I wasn't.

10:37.113 --> 10:43.386
I never got that sense at Toronto or at Rochester, 
although at neither place were there any

10:37.113 --> 10:43.386
planetary astronomers. And so the topic most 
likely didn't come up very much. Do you think

10:47.175 --> 10:49.199
planetary astronomy is real astronomy? Sure. 
Sure, I sure do. I think it's exciting stuff. Now,

10:54.069 --> 10:56.775
as I recall, NASA for many years had this block 
grant for planetary astronomy that they gave to

10:57.025 --> 11:01.851
McDonald. And then in, what, 88 or 87 or something, 
it was switched to individuals or something like

11:01.871 --> 11:07.398
that? That's right. I

11:08.059 --> 11:15.087
became aware of this later on when I got involved in 
administrative matters. But NASA provided a

11:15.187 --> 11:26.982
facilities grant, or a block grant as it was 
called, to McDonald in exchange for access to the

11:15.187 --> 11:26.982
McDonald facilities, principally the 107-inch. 
by planetary astronomers throughout the US. They

11:31.471 --> 11:36.159
had to compete for the telescope time, which in the 
early years meant that Harlan had to agree to give

11:31.471 --> 11:36.159
it to you. Later, there got to be a tack and a real 
competition that was involved. I was the last

11:41.287 --> 11:51.703
person in the world, and I guess because Harlan 
suggested I do it, to write my letters asking for

11:41.287 --> 11:51.703
telescope time in pen and ink on paper. He got a kick 
out of that. But I mean, no kidding. I would really

11:55.667 --> 11:58.389
write them on pen and ink and paper. And I still got 
some Xerox copies of that stuff. And I guess he was

12:01.112 --> 12:02.854
the last observatory. I mean, he was the last 
old-time observatory director that made the

12:02.894 --> 12:10.041
decisions without an observing committee or 
anything like that. Is that true? That's right.

12:12.003 --> 12:13.024
During most of the 70s. Now, I'm not sure what year 
it changed, but it was right around 1978. It may

12:17.649 --> 12:21.893
have been a year or two earlier or a year or two, 
certainly not more than a year or so later. that

12:22.767 --> 12:51.660
prior to that time harlan kept a huge poster board 
of uh of graph paper basically on in his office and

12:22.767 --> 12:51.660
he had each telescope and he had uh the calendar on 
the x-axis and each telescope was listed on the

12:22.767 --> 12:51.660
y-axis and he would write in in pencil the 
observing programs and since and he wrote him in on

12:22.767 --> 12:51.660
pencil because he would change them right up to the 
day of the run there were times when uh when my

12:52.079 --> 13:00.728
observing runs were changed at the last minute for 
a variety of reasons, none of which seemed to me

12:52.079 --> 13:00.728
good at the time, but I'm sure they were good in his 
eyes. That went on until, as I say, the late 70s when

13:01.949 --> 13:20.128
the scheduling was turned over to David Evans, and 
then maybe pretty quickly Rob Robinson began

13:01.949 --> 13:20.128
helping him with it, and they did it in a similar way 
in the sense that they had golf tees and pegboard,

13:20.783 --> 13:29.678
and they reproduced Harlan's graph paper system 
in a different mechanism. But it was still the same

13:29.698 --> 13:30.759
thing. You submitted your proposals. They sort of 
read them and decided who got telescope time and

13:31.921 --> 13:36.629
put the pegboard up accordingly. And then it was in 
the early to mid-'80s, we went over to an actual

13:37.210 --> 13:44.682
tack. Telescope Allocation Committee, which 
reviewed the proposals, made decisions, and

13:45.438 --> 13:55.818
those decisions were honored by Harlan and now by 
the current director, Frank Bash. Honest Engine

13:56.639 --> 14:07.159
Scouts Honor is committee allocation of 
telescope time better than beneficent despot.

14:07.392 --> 14:10.957
I've thought a lot about that because I've seen 
both of them at Texas. And my conclusion is that

14:11.157 --> 14:17.806
from the point of view of the science that gets 
done, I don't think it makes a whit worth of

14:11.157 --> 14:17.806
difference. From the point of view of the feelings 
of the people proposing for time and getting the

14:18.326 --> 14:26.277
time, it makes a tremendous difference. Because 
when there's a group of colleagues who evaluate

14:26.297 --> 14:33.366
one's proposal, come to their best decision, and 
then render that judgment, there is more

14:33.633 --> 14:43.728
acceptance than when a single individual says 
I've made the decision based on my best reading of

14:33.633 --> 14:43.728
the circumstances. So I don't think it makes any 
difference in the science that gets done. I don't

14:46.832 --> 14:53.261
think it made any difference when it went from 
Harlan to David Evans to the TAC in who got

14:46.832 --> 14:53.261
telescope time. I haven't done the statistics to 
prove it, but I don't believe there was any

14:53.362 --> 14:56.306
difference. But there was a tremendous 
improvement in the acceptance of the telescope

14:57.147 --> 15:03.336
schedule by the people listed on it. Now, 
currently, you're the assistant director at

15:03.923 --> 15:09.308
McDonald's, and Frank is on vacation. So I'll hit 
you, because usually it's like the co-pilot

15:11.290 --> 15:16.074
always lands the plane. The assistant director 
does all the work. What's the status of planetary

15:19.437 --> 15:23.261
astronomy at UT and Texas today? I think it's as 
healthy as it was at any time in the history of

15:24.422 --> 15:33.390
Texas. There's obviously the difference that 
there is not someone with an intense interest in

15:33.944 --> 15:42.673
planetary astronomy in the directorship 
position. That changed when Harlan retired as

15:42.894 --> 15:46.798
director and Frank came in. Frank's a radio 
astronomer interested in galaxies, in galactic

15:47.198 --> 15:51.303
structure. And he's not hostile to planetary 
astronomy, but it's not of intense interest to him

15:51.823 --> 15:57.229
such as it was for Harlan. So that changed. The 
quality of the research hasn't changed at all.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.252
We've got both the Cochrans are still there. Larry 
Trafton's there. Ed Barker's there. There are a

16:08.797 --> 16:13.424
couple of postdocs that have come and gone working 
in that area. Artie Hotzis is there now working

16:13.705 --> 16:16.248
with Bill Cochran. The emphasis of the program has 
changed somewhat as the years go by, but that's

16:17.009 --> 16:22.838
normal in any research program. So I think the 
quality of the program now is as good as it's ever

16:23.359 --> 16:28.707
been. The amount of telescope time granted to 
planetary astronomy in this competitive TAC

16:29.294 --> 16:35.900
environment has stayed high. It consistently 
exceeds the amount of time that's been funded by

16:36.921 --> 16:43.507
NASA. We still get quite a few outside observers 
coming in. There's Drew Potter from JSC. There's

16:51.015 --> 16:58.862
Alan Stern from Southwest Research Institute and 
others who come in to do make use of the McDonald

16:59.467 --> 17:00.869
facilities. So I think it's as healthy as it's ever 
been. Here's something that goes for astronomy in

17:04.514 --> 17:08.559
general as well as planetary astronomy. Times are 
getting tough, folks. What do you see in the

17:11.423 --> 17:12.504
future? And I think planetary astronomy will 
just, because we both agree it's part of

17:12.544 --> 17:21.295
astronomy, so it's going to rise and fall with the 
tide. What do you think's in the future for the next

17:22.917 --> 17:26.402
couple of years, the next couple of decades? With 
respect to planetary astronomy at McDonald?

17:30.210 --> 17:35.037
Astronomy in general and planetary astronomy at 
McDonald. I think for McDonald, things are really

17:35.057 --> 17:37.080
looking up. McDonald over all fields. Because on 
April 1st, the Regents approved the

17:39.984 --> 17:55.046
spectroscopic survey telescope, which is the 
primary will have a hexagonal shape, 91 hexagonal

17:39.984 --> 17:55.046
segments put together to make a hex primary, which 
will be 10 meters by 11 meters. So it'll be a huge

17:55.547 --> 17:57.570
telescope to go at McDonald. Assuming that we can 
get all our partners to sign the legal agreements

17:58.090 --> 18:07.661
and that the bids for construction come back 
within budget, we will have that in full operation

17:58.090 --> 18:07.661
by sometime in 1997. And you're going to put it on 
flat top? It'll be on flat top. Which is now called

18:10.764 --> 18:11.926
Mount? Mount Fulks. Right. But it's flat top to us 
old-timers, right? Right. So I see the prospects

18:17.692 --> 18:22.377
from McDonald being outstanding. And the 
spectroscopic survey telescope, and we

18:22.397 --> 18:26.562
dedicated the spectroscopy for... minute field 
of view, so it's not appropriate for large-scale

18:26.896 --> 18:33.749
imaging, small imaging, okay. I see planetary 
astronomy having a very, very big role to play in

18:35.011 --> 18:41.484
that. One question that I have on my list here is how 
well do you think astronomers in general and

18:41.604 --> 18:49.579
planetary astronomers in particular have sold 
their field And it's particularly appropriate to

18:50.268 --> 19:02.762
ask you, because I think McDonald has done a 
tremendous job compared to, say, Mount Wilson and

18:50.268 --> 19:02.762
Palomar, who generally have a the public be damned 
attitude, I think it's fair to say. I mean, you're

19:03.643 --> 19:09.610
obviously doing a lot with the general public. And 
as you know, Susan Shorn is the assistant editor

19:09.630 --> 19:15.136
for Stardate. That was Harlan's idea to do it. And 
do you think that has worked out well to really get

19:19.428 --> 19:24.697
the public involved? Oh, yeah. I mean, it makes a 
tremendous difference in how we are treated

19:25.198 --> 19:33.732
within the state of Texas by the legislature and 
the university. Frank has said to me that he has sat

19:35.695 --> 19:45.672
in meetings with prominent members of the 
legislature, or lunches with prominent members

19:35.695 --> 19:45.672
of the legislature, who, and friends of the 
observatory who are discussing the role of

19:46.242 --> 20:07.261
McDonald with these people, who have said that 
their connection to McDonald is through

19:46.242 --> 20:07.261
Stardate, through the magazine, through the 
radio program, that they take great pride in

19:46.242 --> 20:07.261
driving through Washington DC and hearing on the 
radio Stardate come on and reference the

19:46.242 --> 20:07.261
University of Texas at Austin. So our public 
outreach program is very effective for us in

20:07.281 --> 20:15.709
maintaining a presence with the political 
structure in the state of Texas. But that is a

20:18.295 --> 20:20.898
reason for doing it. It's not the primary reason 
for doing it in my mind, nor was it in Harlan's, nor

20:20.998 --> 20:25.483
is it in Frank's. That's a spinoff from you do it 
because the people who have paid the bill for all of

20:26.124 --> 20:39.638
our research have a right to hear the results from 
that research in a way they can understand. And you

20:41.069 --> 20:49.483
have a huge number of other things going on with the 
public, you know, little observing sessions down

20:41.069 --> 20:49.483
at the visitor center and the visitor center. Have 
you ever thought about painting the shutters

20:50.465 --> 20:56.335
yellow and putting up a McDonald's on the 
mountain? Because everyone always expects...

20:57.978 --> 20:59.040
McDonald's Golden Arches. I know that the public 
oftentimes get confused between McDonald's, the

20:59.260 --> 21:10.196
restaurant chain, and McDonald's Observatory, 
but no, we haven't actually thought about putting

20:59.260 --> 21:10.196
Yellow Arches out there. Maybe if the funding 
situation gets bad enough, we can approach them.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.802
Have you ever approached McDonald's? No, not to my 
knowledge. Because, I mean, I don't know how many

21:16.625 --> 21:21.572
times I've been on the mountain, people say, you 
know, where do we get the hamburgers? And the

21:21.552 --> 21:24.797
second question is, where's the gasoline 
station? Right. And where's the restroom?

21:30.686 --> 21:44.687
But that is in marked contrast to a number of other 
observatories that we could name, that probably

21:30.686 --> 21:44.687
because they had private funding sources, and I'm 
talking about Molson and Belmar, had only

21:30.686 --> 21:44.687
discussed for the general public. There's two 
things that underlie that, I think. One of them is

21:50.476 --> 21:53.339
that in the will from W.J. McDonald, in which he 
gave the bequest to the university to erect and

21:53.359 --> 22:12.381
equip, if I can remember the quote, it's something 
like, to erect and equip an observatory for the

21:53.359 --> 22:12.381
study and the promotion of the study of the science 
of astronomy. And that promotion of the study of

22:12.941 --> 22:17.867
the science of astronomy in his will has been used 
as the justification for a strong public outreach

22:18.218 --> 22:24.667
program. But I think that reason is more of a 
post-hope justification rather than something

22:25.188 --> 22:33.920
that started it. It really started and was 
maintained and grew because Harlan Smith

22:34.241 --> 22:38.887
believed in it. He was absolutely dedicated to a 
strong public outreach program. One of the key

22:44.515 --> 22:47.179
things he wanted to accomplish and he did 
accomplish. personal opinion why do you think

22:47.530 --> 23:13.470
that kind of attitude is so rare among astronomers 
especially since now basically we're all

22:47.530 --> 23:13.470
supported by public money in one way or another um 
you know i think at the root the root reason for it in

22:47.530 --> 23:13.470
my mind is that is that most researchers are not 
very facile in dealing with other people They're

23:14.345 --> 23:29.704
outstanding in dealing with the technicalities 
of a science, in dealing with the mathematics,

23:14.345 --> 23:29.704
with the instrumentation, with the observing 
programs, with the observing plans, with the

23:14.345 --> 23:29.704
getting of the money, the writing of the grants, 
the writing of the papers. But in everyday normal

23:30.365 --> 23:39.036
social environments, I think an awful lot of 
high-tech researchers, like astronomers, are

23:30.365 --> 23:39.036
not very facile. and that they're uncomfortable 
with it. And so there's a tendency to focus in on the

23:41.186 --> 23:58.289
nitty gritty of the research and stay away from, 
and therefore later to put down, the part of

23:41.186 --> 23:58.289
research where it's communicating at a very 
elementary level the fundamentals of what we've

23:41.186 --> 23:58.289
discovered. And unless you're really good at 
communicating with the public, such as Harlan

23:58.969 --> 24:08.702
was, or to use the current example, Carl Sagan, 
unless you're really good at that, It's hard to do.

24:10.918 --> 24:12.860
And if it's hard to do, people tend to stay away from 
it. If they stay away from it, then they tend to

24:12.921 --> 24:18.829
think, well, that's not very important because 
I'm not in it. It's not very important. And it tends

24:19.991 --> 24:22.995
to be downrated.

24:26.781 --> 24:27.342
All right. Now it's time for funny stories. All 
right. You got any funny Harlan Smith stories?

24:38.163 --> 24:43.288
I mean, for example, in Big and Bright, they never 
mentioned the spectrum of the Swiss Army knife,

24:38.163 --> 24:43.288
which was probably before your time. That was 
before my time. I've heard that many times, never

24:44.389 --> 24:49.133
directly from Harlan, so I can neither confirm nor 
deny it. What was the story? Well, the story was

24:50.114 --> 24:55.359
that, in fact, I did hear that from Harlan one time. 
I did hear that from him one time. He mentioned it to

24:58.982 --> 25:05.908
me once with respect to, I can't remember with what 
respect, but in any event, The story was that he was

25:06.007 --> 25:22.426
observing on the 82-inch telescope at Coudet and 
that the iron arc spectrum, which was produced by

25:06.007 --> 25:22.426
two electrodes close to each other and a high 
electrical curve flowing between the two

25:06.007 --> 25:22.426
electrodes. Thomas Edison's arrangement. 
Right. So it just gave you a big, bright arc. That

25:27.552 --> 25:34.900
the arc was weak and that Harlan said, well, we need 
to adjust the arc to make it brighter on the plates

25:35.437 --> 25:52.416
and so he pulled out his handy swiss army knife and 
inserted it between the electrodes to make the

25:35.437 --> 25:52.416
adjustment with the power on and it is said that in 
this story i don't know if it's true or not that it

25:35.437 --> 25:52.416
vaporized the blade of the knife which is entirely 
plausible to me. A lot of iron lines and chromium

25:54.673 --> 26:02.524
and everything, and you can also see molecular 
bands from the handle of the Swiss Army knife.

26:02.984 --> 26:05.949
Because the shutter was open, wasn't it, on the 
plate? I don't know that. Supposedly there is a

26:07.210 --> 26:09.413
spectrum that exists. Well, I've heard that. I 
don't know whether that's true. It's also told

26:12.598 --> 26:16.824
that Harlan went out and threw the knife down the 
mountainside. Now, that does not sound like

26:16.864 --> 26:18.847
Harlan. I don't believe that happened. It doesn't 
sound like Harlan. I don't think he would do that.

26:23.058 --> 26:27.003
But whether there's a plate that shows these, I 
don't know. Any other stories? Well, Harlan, he

26:32.411 --> 26:43.306
had a tendency to focus in his mind on what he was 
doing to the exclusion of other things going on

26:32.411 --> 26:43.306
around him. And we spent quite a few nights 
observing on a project to attempt to measure

26:43.326 --> 26:51.377
whether or not there was a time cosmologically 
time variability in Planck's constant. This was

26:56.075 --> 26:57.217
in the early 70s. And

26:58.539 --> 27:05.869
we did a lot of cast screen observing on the 107 at 
that time together.

27:09.054 --> 27:14.641
There were several nights when we would have the 
platform up off the floor, raised up to get access

27:09.054 --> 27:14.641
to the cast instrument. And Harlan would say, I'm 
going to check the weather. meant going outside on

27:18.914 --> 27:40.213
the catwalk and walking around the dome and he 
would just charge for the door and walk right off

27:18.914 --> 27:40.213
the platform now at no time was the platform more 
than maybe two feet off the floor on any of these

27:18.914 --> 27:40.213
occasions but it would happen night after night he 
wouldn't he would be so focused on what he was doing

27:18.914 --> 27:40.213
that he wouldn't pay any attention to his 
surroundings. And he would fall off and skid along

27:42.144 --> 27:47.892
on the floor and look back and say, I must remember 
not to do that. And then he'd do it again. Do you

27:51.196 --> 27:54.820
think Harlan could have done even more had he done a 
little less?

27:57.824 --> 28:01.909
I think that's a very good question. It

28:02.070 --> 28:10.420
goes to the heart of what Harlan was like in his 
research and his directing, which is that He

28:10.619 --> 28:14.764
attempted to move on all possible fronts 
simultaneously. And it worked like a champ when

28:15.285 --> 28:19.030
there was lots of money. Because he would fund 
nearly everything. He never met an idea he didn't

28:22.895 --> 28:24.316
like. And that meant we had an incredible number of 
things going on simultaneously. And that was

28:32.507 --> 28:34.249
great when there was money to support them. 
Because some would plan to pan out, some would not.

28:36.372 --> 28:39.816
And if they didn't pan out, he'd let them go with 
some exceptions. But when the mid-80s hit, and

28:40.471 --> 28:53.869
suddenly money began to get tight when the second 
oil crunch hit, and literally the depression hit

28:40.471 --> 28:53.869
in Texas. And the 300-inch telescope got 
eliminated.

28:59.617 --> 29:02.401
We entered an environment in which money was ever 
tighter. And that mode of operation of expanding

29:03.142 --> 29:07.187
on all fronts, funding everything possible, was 
simply incompatible with the physical

29:07.724 --> 29:11.410
situation. And it got more and more frustrating 
for Harlan as he attempted to do this and could not.

29:18.200 --> 29:25.752
And I think that was one of the key reasons why he 
chose to retire from the directorship in 1989.

29:25.892 --> 29:35.166
That he had, McDonald Observatory had entered an 
era in which it wasn't fun for him to be director

29:25.892 --> 29:35.166
anymore. When we had lots of money, I think if he had 
focused it on fewer efforts, we would have made a

29:35.652 --> 29:50.553
lot more progress in those efforts, but there may 
have been some other things that we accomplished

29:35.652 --> 29:50.553
that never would have got started. It's a 
different style, the two different styles. It

29:53.237 --> 29:54.719
wouldn't be Harlan if he was different. It 
wouldn't have been Harlan. He was not focused like

29:55.580 --> 29:59.466
that on specific research areas. He had a 
tremendously broad interest in them. I got a lot of

30:02.821 --> 30:13.839
comments the other week at Austin about the fact 
that Harlan was loyal and maybe sometimes too

30:02.821 --> 30:13.839
loyal, and we're talking here like image tube and 
everything like that. Yes. Which I guess is the

30:14.520 --> 30:17.585
greatest of his reign. Yes. Did they ever get 
anything out of that? They brought the

30:20.750 --> 30:29.925
electronographic image tube was brought to the 
point where it actually obtained astronomical

30:20.750 --> 30:29.925
data that were never used. To the best of my 
knowledge, they were never used because there

30:30.428 --> 30:37.695
were no astronomers tied into the particular 
program. That is that that development was funded

30:38.475 --> 30:49.445
by Harlan and conducted by Paul Gribbeval with 
almost no astronomical expertise attached to it.

30:49.465 --> 30:54.970
There were no astronomers demanding that this get 
operational so I can use it for my research. There

30:55.671 --> 30:56.912
weren't any. And so when it became operational, 
there weren't any to use it. And it became

31:00.567 --> 31:05.552
operational almost at the same time that CCDs came 
in. There was a period of a few years where the

31:06.733 --> 31:13.599
camera could have been used for astronomical 
uses, but it was too late. There were no

31:14.981 --> 31:16.242
astronomers involved. By the time any 
astronomers could have got involved, CCDs had

31:16.302 --> 31:22.087
beat it.

31:23.388 --> 31:30.355
Do you think you, and I talked to Greg Shields, and 
I'll let you know, maybe I did tell you the other

31:23.388 --> 31:30.355
night, But we were talking in the library last 
week, and we both felt that actually in both of us,

31:30.925 --> 31:49.586
there was only one time in the 30-some years that 
I've known Harlan, and almost as long for Greg,

31:30.925 --> 31:49.586
that we ever got to know the real Harlan. And when 
you met him, he was open and all that, but do you

31:50.507 --> 31:57.895
think there was still a little curtain or 
something like that? Oh, yeah, I think that, I

31:58.145 --> 32:04.191
mean, I worked really closely with Harlan for 11 
years. 11 years I had the shared secretary in the

32:04.211 --> 32:09.856
office between us. And I saw him every day. And I 
felt that there was always a distance between us,

32:12.498 --> 32:21.667
almost always. Now, there were times when that 
would break down. And that's not to say, it's not

32:24.029 --> 32:27.072
because he was a formal guy. It's just, as you say, 
there was this veil, this curtain that the inner

32:27.608 --> 32:35.058
workings of Harlan Smith were not always visible. 
That it was very hard to know him as just another

32:36.059 --> 32:38.642
human being. He was very closed in that respect. He 
was intensely loyal, as you say. He was generous.

32:51.379 --> 32:57.447
But I never really felt that I knew the real Harlan. 
Except occasionally I would see it. And one time I

32:59.955 --> 33:10.606
mentioned to you the other night that what was very 
obvious I was seeing the real Harlan was when he

32:59.955 --> 33:10.606
called Frank Bash and me into his office, into 
Frank's office. This was after Harlan had quit as

33:11.547 --> 33:14.450
director. And told the two of us that he had been 
diagnosed with cancer, that it was going to be

33:14.470 --> 33:24.480
really touch and go as to whether he could be cured 
from this. uh and he was clearly very emotional

33:25.456 --> 33:54.838
about it and frank asked him a question that had to 
do with well to concentrate on winning this battle

33:25.456 --> 33:54.838
are you you told chairman are you planning to lead 
the faculty and not teach in the fall because he was

33:25.456 --> 33:54.838
scheduled to teach and harlan said uh he said no 
that he was he was going to tell the chairman but he

33:25.456 --> 33:54.838
was going to teach in the fall he was going to stay on 
the faculty he was going to continue his

33:25.456 --> 33:54.838
appointment and not take retirement because The 
only security Joan had was his pitching. And as he

34:00.479 --> 34:03.583
said that, he literally teared up. And I have never 
seen Harlan do that. I've never seen him do that

34:05.325 --> 34:07.968
before. And this was a real person coming through 
that he cared deeply that Joan have whatever

34:08.068 --> 34:20.523
security he could leave her if he didn't make it 
through this illness. There were other times when

34:22.065 --> 34:24.167
he He was generous and I could see a real human being 
there. I had a bruising battle with David Evans one

34:31.718 --> 34:46.020
time over the telescope schedule in which I 
overstepped my bounds somewhat in a way that was

34:31.718 --> 34:46.020
inappropriate and irritated David. David was 
right. He had a very strong right to be irritated

34:47.294 --> 34:49.957
with me. And so we ended up having a public meeting 
in which we disagreed strongly with each other, in

34:50.718 --> 35:02.372
which a decision needed to be taken as to which of us 
was going to win. And I was already Harlan's, at

35:02.972 --> 35:12.784
that time I was assistant director, and at the end 
of the meeting, Harlan chose David's position.

35:14.013 --> 35:26.866
And when I got back to my office after that, I had a 
small scrap of paper, which had obviously just

35:14.013 --> 35:26.866
been torn off of some other larger piece of paper, 
onto which was affixed a Band-Aid. And next to the

35:28.027 --> 35:38.918
Band-Aid, Harland had written, one Band-Aid for 
one bruised ego, H. It was a nice touch. It took an

35:38.938 --> 35:41.100
awful lot of the sting out of him siding with David. 
He was right to do so, but it was a nice touch. It was

35:47.883 --> 35:51.108
the kind of thing that Harlan would do most 
unexpectedly. Do you think that Harlan's

35:51.889 --> 36:02.665
gung-ho, let's go get him attitude started to fall 
on the authorities in the last few years, the

35:51.889 --> 36:02.665
authorities of the University of Texas? I've 
heard that. Yeah, I think it did. I don't think they

36:07.793 --> 36:09.315
were... I think they respected Harlan's power, 
but I don't think they really liked him. I'll give

36:19.257 --> 36:22.583
you an example. When we were working to get the 
300-inch telescope project approved—no,

36:22.663 --> 36:31.256
I'm sorry. Let me back up. Let me give you a 
different example.

36:38.776 --> 36:40.898
The Space Telescope Science Institute was up for 
grabs. Where was it going to go? And Harlan wanted

36:42.179 --> 36:43.561
it to go in Austin. And so we were trying hard to get 
it. And he was... At that moment, we were changing

36:47.184 --> 36:54.671
presidents at UT Austin. From who to who? We were 
going from Lorene Rogers to Peter Kwan. And...

37:05.455 --> 37:15.229
Jerry Falcon, who's now the provost and executive 
vice president of the university, and has been for

37:05.455 --> 37:15.229
many years, he was executive assistant to Lorene 
Rogers. I don't know his exact title, but he was her

37:15.249 --> 37:19.635
right-hand man in her office. He wasn't vice 
president of something or other. So we were

37:22.459 --> 37:27.807
working through him, and we were trying hard to get 
the university to put in a proposal for SDSCI. And

37:29.149 --> 37:31.412
the

37:33.248 --> 37:36.032
We went to Jerry and said, can we do this? And Jerry 
said, he said, Harlan, I can't get this done. He

37:41.320 --> 37:50.874
said, I'm between two presidents here who

37:41.320 --> 37:50.874
can't deal with this. Okay, well, after the 
presidency changed, we went to Peter Flon. And We

38:02.948 --> 38:11.479
met him in the basement office of the geology 
building, I believe, and he was in this little

38:02.948 --> 38:11.479
bitty cubicle because he hadn't quite become 
president yet. Harlan and I went to him and spoke to

38:14.082 --> 38:16.565
him about this project.

38:19.669 --> 38:24.596
Peter Flan had been at UT Austin when Harlan was 
building the 107-inch, and he knew Harlan. He'd

38:24.816 --> 38:25.837
been president after that. He'd been president at 
UT San Antonio. And so Flora looked him in the eye

38:28.143 --> 38:35.827
and said, Harlan, I know the way you operate, I know 
the way you work, and I need you to tell me the truth

38:28.143 --> 38:35.827
on this. Have you already gone around me to the UT 
system on this project? And Harlan said,

38:42.503 --> 38:43.906
absolutely not. I would not do that. I've got to 
work with you through channels. And I sat there

38:47.171 --> 39:01.337
dumbfounded because I had personally delivered 
the materials to Executive Vice Chancellor Jim

38:47.171 --> 39:01.337
Duncan on this matter down at UT System and had 
Duncan look me in the eye and said, you realize this

38:47.171 --> 39:01.337
is out of channels? And I said, yes, sir, I know 
that. My instructions are to give you this stuff.

39:07.765 --> 39:11.011
The UT administration knew how he worked. They 
respected his power, but I don't think they liked

39:11.271 --> 39:14.096
him. And so Harlan really had a vicious streak. He 
could double deal when it was necessary. That's

39:19.946 --> 39:21.809
right. Not vicious. Vicious is not right. It's the 
right word. It's more that he had a very strong...

39:33.027 --> 39:46.303
belief in his rightness, in that he was right, and 
that to some extent, he'd never have said it this

39:33.027 --> 39:46.303
way, but to some extent the ends justified the 
means. It was classic in faculty meetings when I

39:47.345 --> 39:52.091
was on the faculty. It was absolutely classic the 
way he would handle the faculty, in that he had a

39:52.171 --> 39:56.436
proposal He would bring it to the faculty to 
discuss, as was right and proper. There would be a

40:01.198 --> 40:03.280
majority opposed to him. And so he would say, it's 
clear we have not reached consensus on this yet, so

40:03.701 --> 40:09.308
let's continue the discussion later. And he would 
literally continue the discussion until he had a

40:09.648 --> 40:14.213
majority. He would never let it not happen. It's 
just he knew he was right. I mean, he had no question

40:22.563 --> 40:26.608
but that he was right. And I'm going to change the 
subject. One of the things I put in this proposal

40:29.654 --> 40:42.094
that NASA bought was that any good observatory, if 
they're lucky, has somebody, and in the case of

40:29.654 --> 40:42.094
McDonald's, it's Bob Dahl, whose equipment we 
have all used. And yet, those kind of guys don't get

40:42.114 --> 40:45.700
to write scientific papers. And there's a guy, 
John Geary, for example, at Center for

40:45.920 --> 40:51.429
Astrophysics, who's the Bob Dahl of the Center for 
Astrophysics. Without them, we'd all be dead

40:51.449 --> 40:52.991
meat. All right. Now, Bob Tall is still alive and 
well and kicking, but how do you handle those

40:54.179 --> 40:59.046
people? How do you keep them on the payroll? I mean, 
they're necessary, but they don't meet, I mean,

41:00.528 --> 41:09.601
they're absolutely vital, but they don't meet the 
qualifications of the philosophy department or

41:00.528 --> 41:09.601
the English department or whatever. The way 
Harlan did it with Bob Tall was that Just before I

41:15.509 --> 41:29.966
got to Texas, I don't know how much before, maybe 
the same year I got there, Bob was denied tenure, a

41:15.509 --> 41:29.966
promotion from assistant professor to associate 
professor by the faculty, I assume based on

41:15.509 --> 41:29.966
publication criteria. Weight of paper. Weight of 
paper and a number of publications and science

41:31.108 --> 41:34.332
done. Whereas he was clearly an unbelievable 
talent, a world-class talent in

41:35.073 --> 41:41.100
instrumentation. So Harlan told me later, And he 
said this a number of different times in all the

41:44.467 --> 41:48.413
time I knew him. So it's something that I know 
happened, although I wasn't there to witness it.

41:54.622 --> 42:03.796
But he said that after that decision was taken, he 
told Bob Tull that as far as he, Harlan Smith, was

41:54.622 --> 42:03.796
concerned, Bob Tull had tenure. And that Bob Tull 
had a job at McDonald's as long as Harlan Smith had a

42:03.816 --> 42:09.445
job at McDonald's. And indeed, he would let 
himself go before he would let Bob Tull go. And

42:13.846 --> 42:15.127
that's the way it happened. How important has Bob 
been to astronomy at UT? Crucial. Absolutely

42:22.334 --> 42:22.995
crucial. Because our history through the 70s and 
80s was based on our excellence in Coudet

42:23.115 --> 42:34.386
spectroscopy. And that excellence was built by a 
number of different people. For example, David

42:37.909 --> 42:42.233
Lambert, who is clearly one of the finest 
observational astronomers in the world doing

42:42.972 --> 42:48.161
two-day spectroscopy. But his success was built 
on the foundation that Bob Tall built. And if Bob

42:52.809 --> 43:00.884
Tall had not been there, McDonald wouldn't be 
one-half, one-third what it is today in terms of

42:52.809 --> 43:00.884
recognition throughout the astronomical 
community. He was absolutely crucial.

43:05.973 --> 43:07.275
Do you think that the... The last-minute decision 
to strike out the 300-inch in the last hour of the

43:09.196 --> 43:17.392
legislature, do you think that took a lot of steam 
out of Harlan? Yeah, it did. During that period of

43:21.179 --> 43:29.415
time, that's all Harlan did, was the 300-inch 
telescope.

43:30.948 --> 43:45.582
When the primary mirror money was lined out of the 
state budget because of the oil crisis, it set us

43:30.948 --> 43:45.582
back from a project that was on its way to probable 
success. I won't say certainty, but probable

43:45.602 --> 43:53.950
success to a project that was most likely not going 
to happen. And Harlan didn't really recognize

43:53.970 --> 43:57.434
that for a little while. He kept pushing it really 
hard. And as late as the year when Bill Cunningham

44:00.530 --> 44:13.362
became president, changing over from Pete Flon, I 
forget what year that was. It was probably 86 or 87.

44:17.286 --> 44:27.195
We had a breakfast meeting, Harlan and I and key 
members of the Board of Visitors, with Bill

44:17.286 --> 44:27.195
Cunningham right early on in his tenure as 
president. And Harlan brought up the 300-inch

44:28.222 --> 44:31.307
telescope. And Bill looked him straight in the eye 
and said quite loudly to the whole table, he said,

44:31.327 --> 44:37.776
Harlan, the 300-inch telescope is dead. Forget 
it. And I think that was when it really became clear

44:40.841 --> 44:44.967
to Harlan that it was over with. Did the torpedoing 
of the 300-inch have any effect on the general

44:45.788 --> 44:52.057
faculty and staff at McDonald's? I mean, were you 
guys in a dump, sir? Yeah, I think there were

44:54.040 --> 44:56.524
several years where we were kind of at a loss 
because it was obvious that we needed more big

44:56.960 --> 45:02.869
telescopes. It had been obvious for about 10 years 
from 1978 that we needed big telescopes, another

45:02.949 --> 45:14.968
big telescope, and yet we had no realistic 
possibility of getting one in the near term. So

45:15.691 --> 45:19.055
that there was a period of time where people were 
very upset. We almost lost David Lambert to Ohio

45:19.355 --> 45:25.743
State on the basis of the Columbus Project and 
their involvement in Columbus. It was nip and

45:25.823 --> 45:27.725
tuck, and he ended up staying. But I attribute the 
fact that he was interested in leaving to this

45:29.087 --> 45:37.857
climate that we were living in at that time. But 
Colin did what... what he'd always done he

45:40.733 --> 46:07.872
proceeded to move on many fronts at once and i and i 
agreed with him at that time on this that we tried to

45:40.733 --> 46:07.872
get involved with the sophia project using our 
connections uh through paul harvey and through uh

45:40.733 --> 46:07.872
hans mark we moved on inspector's gothic survey 
telescope through our connection with dan

45:40.733 --> 46:07.872
weedman at penn state and there were several other 
Projects that were thought to be worthy of pursuit

46:08.543 --> 46:13.912
that were explored and one by one they fell out. 
They didn't happen We we didn't get involved

46:14.192 --> 46:22.686
except for the SST spectroscopic survey 
telescope and that one Is now going to come to pass?

46:23.567 --> 46:32.661
One last question 107 inch at Westinghouse was a 
fiasco as far as the mechanical operation of the

46:23.567 --> 46:32.661
telescope. I well know that yeah Do you think that 
has colored the attitude of the UT administration

46:34.852 --> 46:41.619
towards the SST, Spectroscopic Survey 
Telescope? Yes. The history of the UT

46:43.321 --> 47:02.142
administration with respect to McDonnell 
Observatory has been that we consistently, from

46:43.321 --> 47:02.142
their view, we consistently either lie to them 
about how much it's going to cost or are

46:43.321 --> 47:02.142
incompetent to figure out how much it's going to 
cost.
