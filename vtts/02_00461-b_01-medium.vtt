WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:06.883
Test of the Sony Remote Control RM-15.

00:09.128 --> 00:10.130
Testing, testing. Today is February 4th, 1984. 
This is a test.

00:19.336 --> 00:25.405
Because I was fluent in my language and I could sit 
down and dash a card up or a letter. It was not time

00:26.326 --> 00:29.711
consuming because I could do it easily. And now I 
can do it better. I write to my family. I can dash up a

00:34.638 --> 00:37.362
letter faster than... Gene had. But not then, I 
couldn't. So I did not take care of my friendships

00:44.711 --> 00:47.515
as well. And I regret that because I had so many good 
friends. What would you say are your, let's say,

00:51.921 --> 00:56.667
two or three best male friends? People that you 
still love? Oh, still active, rather than the ones

01:00.359 --> 01:05.585
I defaulted on? No, I don't think you defaulted on 
them. I think that you had to act on your own needs.

01:10.029 --> 01:29.590
What good is it if you were captured, picked up by 
the feds, only to be a good friend to this person?

01:36.387 --> 01:37.849
And I didn't write to him. She named Dewey. Dewey 
was the guy who gave me that five cent match and got

01:41.214 --> 01:46.961
the job in Beavers.

01:52.990 --> 01:58.497
Ed

01:52.990 --> 01:58.497
and the bosses. I don't write to them, but I 
consider them good friends. When it comes to the

02:03.409 --> 02:07.256
actual closeness, I stop. I want to be close, but 
I... I want to be closer, but I stop.

02:22.557 --> 02:23.398
He's a great artist. He hangs in galleries. He has 
his own gallery in Pebble Beach. And I took some

02:29.728 --> 02:34.234
lessons from him. So I'm his student. He was your 
student? He was my tennis student. We trade. I

02:38.821 --> 02:41.044
teach him tennis and he teach me. We bartered. No 
cash. That's good. That's good. He teach me how to

02:47.053 --> 02:49.797
paint. And, of course, Slim Mayfair. I just 
mentioned him. He's a marvelous person. Great,

02:57.773 --> 03:01.177
great Western. Big heart.

03:06.602 --> 03:08.524
And even my boss, Bill Klein. You know, I could be 
much closer. I would be much closer. I think I would

03:12.468 --> 03:15.531
be much closer with almost anybody. Bill Klein 
gave us kind of a start in our tennis shop, and that

03:16.017 --> 03:28.355
was 20 years later when we were really going into 
that venture and extremely undercapitalized.

03:28.696 --> 03:29.777
Undercapitalized. I mean, ridiculously 
undercapitalized. We had to stock the shop, and

03:32.221 --> 03:42.396
then it said, oh, well, why don't I call up Bill 
Klein, my former boss, I've been seeing him for

03:32.221 --> 03:42.396
many, many years, who... He was up at Sugar Bowl, 
but he had a shop at Gary Dilley Square in San

03:42.781 --> 03:49.409
Francisco. And I was cringed to death. You have to 
throw yourself on the mercy of somebody else.

03:55.096 --> 03:56.218
Yeah, that's not my style. You're too independent 
for that. So anyway, we did that. We went up there,

04:00.563 --> 04:05.329
and sure enough, his brother was in the shop. He 
gave us a stash. Well, we paid for it, but the very

04:07.534 --> 04:12.098
idea of taking something out of somebody else's 
shop. He gave it to us wholesale, so at least we

04:12.338 --> 04:16.662
could make a profit when we sold it. He had stocked 
our first shop in the resort area. Really nice. He

04:24.069 --> 04:28.333
would go to Austria and buy his sweaters and stuff, 
you see, every year. So he had the finest clothes.

04:30.795 --> 04:35.299
So that was his first business.

04:35.583 --> 04:57.608
legal uh fears starting a new business no business 
no just pay your license no i in fact i don't think i

04:35.583 --> 04:57.608
have felt better any any time at any time than being 
in business because once you pay your license fee

04:35.583 --> 04:57.608
to the city then You're dealing with the public, 
and it's cash flow. Nobody bothers you. To be a

05:02.662 --> 05:07.648
businessman is, I think, the ultimate of freedom. 
Government, nobody. You don't need anybody. I

05:13.634 --> 05:16.518
think you don't need to apply for jobs. You don't 
have to worry about a boss, whether he likes what

05:16.718 --> 05:21.583
you do. I was having a ball. But .

05:27.338 --> 05:35.991
I signed

05:27.338 --> 05:35.991
all the contracts.

05:36.011 --> 05:41.599
I did the business negotiations, all of this kind 
of thing. And he was having a ball. Suddenly he was,

05:44.303 --> 05:51.054
could be visible in retrospect now. He was a real 
big shot, a real celebrity. And he was doing all

05:54.507 --> 05:58.833
those kind of things, and I was... She felt stuck in 
the shops. Stuck in the business operation part.

06:01.397 --> 06:03.720
And so we had many problems. We didn't quite make 
enough money to hire somebody. Well, we would a

06:06.404 --> 06:11.331
couple of times, but not... We were not quite as... 
If we'd been really successful, I mean, money,

06:11.351 --> 06:16.118
really, I think would have been fun. I think more 
than all, you know, the dollar size was important.

06:22.847 --> 06:23.248
But the... his inability, in his own mind, to enter 
into a contract negotiation. I sign his name

06:31.528 --> 06:34.493
better than he does. I never want to hear about any 
of those kind of things. And I was always, you know,

06:36.616 --> 06:47.852
there's always this discrepancy between what I 
knew he, his intelligence left, all those kind of

06:36.616 --> 06:47.852
things, and yet, just... And you

06:48.355 --> 06:58.408
thought it was odd that he would ask you to sign all 
the contracts? Yeah, the aggressive part of him

06:58.549 --> 07:12.287
was out there on the tennis court or some other 
place, but I never could get hold of it in some of

06:58.549 --> 07:12.287
these other areas that were pretty important. But 
now you see it was done for a very real reason. Yeah,

07:16.157 --> 07:20.946
now I can see why he doesn't want to sign his name on a 
contract. So, in so many ways, it sort of turned out

07:22.408 --> 07:33.827
we did all the right things for all the wrong 
reasons.

07:33.847 --> 07:35.610
Just lucked out. Yeah, lucked out. That's exactly 
it. If you don't have any luck, just forget

07:38.609 --> 07:42.517
everything I ever told you.

07:46.324 --> 07:51.234
And so I would always say, well, okay, but never 
mind that. There's something else, some other

07:51.254 --> 07:55.281
thing to go on to. Let's not really dwell on that. I 
don't really want to deal with that. Let's just go

07:58.468 --> 08:00.752
on to something else. What we're going to go on to 
soon is we're going to get some food in the candy.

08:06.871 --> 08:08.755
You know, I deal in contracts every day. I have to 
read to find printed the specifications. If I miss

08:12.462 --> 08:18.553
one word, you could lose thousands of dollars, you 
know. You got something in you, sir? I think it's

08:21.299 --> 08:23.483
time to get some food.

08:44.911 --> 08:49.677
When the walls were feet high on each side, I could 
have been just run over. I don't know why I did it. I

08:51.860 --> 08:59.830
just really took a real chance to get killed by an 
oncoming train, but I figured I might be able to

08:51.860 --> 08:59.830
hear it. But there was my only, I couldn't get back 
any other way. The roads were still closed, and

09:04.176 --> 09:11.205
they stayed closed for another month before 
anybody could move over the mountain. So it was

09:13.497 --> 09:24.593
kind of a very trying experience because here I was 
almost in the limelight and, you know, virtue

09:13.497 --> 09:24.593
being discovered and what to do. And then 
sometimes you do some, most of the time I run in a

09:24.613 --> 09:33.405
situation like that. Just run, you know, not 
necessarily any big plan.

09:41.376 --> 09:42.458
Did you get back to the cabin? Yeah, went back and 
they were still rescuing people, dogs that had

09:42.539 --> 09:49.930
been snowed in in the cabins, you know. So it went on 
for a long time. The road to Reno didn't open for

09:53.075 --> 09:56.300
another four weeks. I have some nice 8mm movies at 
home, in color, some of that stuff. Were you afraid

10:03.811 --> 10:07.517
that somebody might come up during the month that 
you were back in the cabin? I don't think anybody,

10:09.860 --> 10:14.726
there was no way for any inexperienced person to 
come in. No, I felt very safe on that, but I thought

10:14.746 --> 10:24.657
maybe the publicity of the picture or something, 
might somebody, might be around to find, to

10:14.746 --> 10:24.657
recognize me. Nobody recognized that picture. 
I'm actually going to show you a copy of it. Right,

10:28.922 --> 10:29.363
right. And you twisted your face? Well, I did, more 
or less, inside. I thought it was intense stuff.

10:36.843 --> 10:53.337
Let

10:36.843 --> 10:53.337
me ask you about going back to the camp, some of the 
POW camps. I need to feel more what your day was

10:53.598 --> 10:59.683
like. You were a camp translator in each of these 
camps. You became the translator just by habit, or

11:06.323 --> 11:12.371
that you were the official translator at each 
place along the way? It was pretty informal. I

11:16.356 --> 11:20.321
don't think you got appointed or anything. You 
simply got called in when there was any need for

11:20.341 --> 11:28.612
translation.

11:28.632 --> 11:34.339
It was structured in as much as you had to get up at a 
certain time, six o'clock or whatever it was. for

11:34.859 --> 11:38.705
meals and inspections and reports. I guess they 
had to report to the American Office of Charge. And

11:47.599 --> 11:58.015
then they pretty much tried to have activity like 
you might have in any

11:47.599 --> 11:58.015
youth organization or camp just to keep people 
busy with projects.

12:07.536 --> 12:08.498
Woodworking? Woodworking, painting, letter 
writing, reading. Did you do some of those things?

12:17.515 --> 12:18.537
Yeah. I did some art work. You walk around in groups 
and circles, like around the camp, you can walk all

12:21.721 --> 12:29.490
day as long as you don't touch the wires. Too close 
together. What would you talk about walking

12:33.395 --> 12:34.917
around? Because we're talking about a period of a 
couple of years. Yeah.

12:42.606 --> 12:51.677
Did you fall in with the same bunch of fellows each 
time, or were there people that stuck out in your

12:42.606 --> 12:51.677
mind along the way?

12:52.028 --> 12:59.236
That one picture guy, the artist, I would always 
gravitate to those people that did something

12:52.028 --> 12:59.236
artistic.

13:01.779 --> 13:08.006
Painting, woodworking,

13:01.779 --> 13:08.006
something like that. Sports,

13:08.147 --> 13:13.773
a little bit of soccer I might have played. And then 
that one can't be a lot to play some tennis. I had a

13:15.435 --> 13:16.036
tennis tournament. Wow. No, we didn't really do, 
and then some places we had to work. We had to, I was

13:22.733 --> 13:36.409
in one place, I was a draftsman, you know, I did some 
drafting work for some engineering department

13:22.733 --> 13:36.409
that was nearby. Some army engineering 
department? Yeah, army engineering. So, we did

13:40.534 --> 13:47.162
have, a lot of guys had jobs, and they liked their 
jobs, you know, they kept them busy. But it was,

13:48.222 --> 13:55.392
with us, it was pretty much volunteer whether we 
wanted to work or not. The offices didn't work at

13:56.714 --> 14:01.180
all, and I heard, you know, they were in separate 
camps. With the non-com offices, it was more or

14:01.200 --> 14:05.706
less volunteer basis. But I remember Fort Knox, I 
worked in the hospital. I was probably in orderly

14:13.337 --> 14:15.900
cleaning and stuff. I'm not saying anything about 
anything else. It had to be some kind of a service

14:20.135 --> 14:26.266
child. And mostly, I was invariably drawn into 
translating for other people. because there were

14:33.599 --> 14:39.607
not enough English-speaking prisoners, at least 
not enough. They might know some words, but I

14:39.627 --> 14:47.798
usually ended up with that job because there was 
always a problem of some kind. I want them to do this

14:47.818 --> 14:55.328
and explain this to them.

14:56.369 --> 15:03.218
And there was a lot of conversation with the guards 
and the Americans that was always fascinating.

15:03.687 --> 15:05.853
about what they were doing. They asked us 
questions. What was it like? What do you think?

15:11.389 --> 15:12.553
What our feelings were. We had quite a bit in the 
beginning, especially. We had a lot of

15:14.900 --> 15:16.785
conversation. I do remember one guard telling me 
that, I told you that about the millionaires, that

15:18.048 --> 15:29.641
there were some millionaires in this community. 
And I couldn't figure out how that could be. And

15:30.923 --> 15:39.092
they talked to us about, not too much about 
politics,

15:30.923 --> 15:39.092
or trying to think in terms of politics. It wasn't 
really all that much. They might... and talk about

15:48.878 --> 15:54.964
Hitler or something like that, and they'd laugh 
and say, yeah, that, you know. Because we didn't,

15:54.984 --> 16:01.131
we really didn't know what they knew about Hitler 
and what we knew about Hitler. We really,

16:01.271 --> 16:06.276
probably, we would be talking past each other in 
most cases, I would say. But they knew about it, and

16:07.057 --> 16:14.445
when we were told about it, we're not the same, you 
know, so. But they wanted to know a lot about us, and

16:14.465 --> 16:18.649
we were curious about them. And as a rule, the 
Americans are, you know, by our standards, I think

16:19.388 --> 16:29.281
they're very polite anyway. Polite people by 
nature. They want to know what you're doing and

16:33.307 --> 16:37.512
what you're, if they can, you know, what your needs 
are. That's, they're natural that way. I've found

16:42.319 --> 16:48.687
always that they're out much more polite than And

16:48.987 --> 17:05.038
I think a lot of times if that came across, some 
schlocky guys would misunderstand that take

17:06.082 --> 17:12.088
advantage of it, maybe. I'm sure somebody would do 
that and snicker about it, but they totally

17:12.109 --> 17:25.523
misunderstand

17:12.109 --> 17:25.523
good manners are really interesting to other 
people. They would misunderstand that.

17:29.788 --> 17:31.229
You can't educate them. It wasn't for me to educate 
them. Was there any guard in particular that you

17:34.567 --> 17:39.552
knew like, or commanding officer that you 
remember in particular? No, I do remember one guy

17:41.894 --> 17:50.422
who I believe, now in retrospect, was probably an 
intelligence officer. He came, he was assigned

17:50.442 --> 18:01.452
all of a sudden to the staff, and he would get very 
chummy with us, you know, and laugh and joke. I had a

18:02.933 --> 18:10.123
feeling he was, in fact, to the point where we were 
wondering whether he was straight or not. And he

18:10.143 --> 18:15.951
did take me into a room once and had a conversation 
with me. And I had a feeling that later on, I think he

18:15.971 --> 18:23.942
was probably going to tell us what's up. He spoke in 
German or he was speaking in English? No, I

18:26.085 --> 18:26.726
probably spoke in English. But I had no idea. at the 
time we didn't know about this

18:28.482 --> 18:50.187
that never made itself felt you never had any uh 
well you said to the nazis whatever whoever they

18:28.482 --> 18:50.187
were were statement to themselves yeah they later 
on as things got The

18:51.618 --> 18:59.970
news

18:51.618 --> 18:59.970
got worse and worse. They did get grim and they kind 
of stayed to themselves and would say, I don't

19:00.150 --> 19:11.447
believe any of that stuff because of what came 
through this news. I can't believe any of that.

19:12.408 --> 19:18.819
When they couldn't believe it, do you mean that the 
battle was going badly for Germany? Yeah, yeah,

19:18.839 --> 19:19.260
yeah. The battles would, you know, instead of 
winning these battles, we were losing these

19:19.280 --> 19:25.049
battles, you see. So, and things got very quiet, 
actually.

19:33.263 --> 19:37.150
It was just kind of like a wet blanket in the whole 
camp, you might say. because all the news was bad

19:39.442 --> 19:44.388
all the time. Were there any escape committees or 
anything like that that you remember? That's what

19:47.473 --> 19:48.254
I thought. It wasn't well organized. No. Never. 
Never talked to anybody that wanted to escape or

19:53.000 --> 19:56.925
wanted me to escape. Nothing like that in my camp. 
I'm sure they had it in some camps. I didn't realize

20:02.552 --> 20:06.357
there were that many camps in that many places. I'm 
sure that... different people run, and you get a

20:09.445 --> 20:17.917
different mixture

20:09.445 --> 20:17.917
of people. And some of them had a lot of great 
education, even, from what I read in your book.

20:23.745 --> 20:28.491
They had, you know, got an education that served 
them well later on. Theater. Did you have concerts

20:30.614 --> 20:32.597
there, or plays? Yeah, we had music there. We had 
instruments. We had concerts. And so... A lot of

20:37.340 --> 20:39.262
people were involved with that.

20:43.608 --> 20:47.313
Were the concerts by people from the outside, or 
was it just you? No, I was just German. They would

20:49.135 --> 20:56.845
provide the instruments, and that's all they 
need, and they'd go into it and have concerts and

20:49.135 --> 20:56.845
have plays. They always tried to come up with 
something to entertain ourselves, mostly. Did

21:03.428 --> 21:05.450
you sell handicrafts to the guards? Yeah, we would 
sell handicrafts, not so much to the guard maybe,

21:05.470 --> 21:10.456
but amongst ourselves. We would make toilet bags. 
One guy was good in leather making things. We'd

21:16.843 --> 21:22.569
barter, sometimes with the guards, sometimes 
amongst ourselves. What would an average day have

21:24.151 --> 21:28.896
been, if you could reconstruct an average day? Get 
up early, get up late? Get up early, get up early, 6

21:31.733 --> 21:36.861
o'clock, roll call, breakfast. Everybody 
outside be counted? Counted, every morning

21:38.745 --> 21:41.429
counted, roll call. Was it a large barrack 
generally, or just a small hut? It was a large

21:47.279 --> 21:55.153
compound, but it was always

21:47.279 --> 21:55.153
made into smaller areas. It wasn't just one huge 
burning. When you could go through on certain

21:59.540 --> 22:04.126
days, you were allowed to pass and visit others. 
But it was kind of sectional. Sections. So many

22:10.975 --> 22:15.602
barracks in one section and then another section. 
So you'd have your work hall breakfast, and then

22:15.822 --> 22:22.371
once you had a job, you went to work. And you either 
took your lunch, it was ready, kitchen had already

22:25.677 --> 22:48.023
made and the ones that stayed behind had to have to 
be barracks cleaning every day same routine

22:25.677 --> 22:48.023
cleaning areas outside inside

22:25.677 --> 22:48.023
by that time it's 10 11 o'clock you

22:49.758 --> 23:16.950
could get either into, if you didn't have a job, 
you'd go back to your own project, you'd have a

22:49.758 --> 23:16.950
couple hours to go to your own project, or you could 
stay outside, walk around,

22:49.758 --> 23:16.950
talk to your friends, usually getting some 
exercise

22:49.758 --> 23:16.950
by walking around the canyon. And by that time, 
came close to lunch,

23:19.137 --> 23:27.646
lunchtime. Then

23:27.666 --> 23:35.535
you had, they had some kind of an activity, like a 
meeting. They set up meetings to meet at the hall,

23:35.555 --> 23:49.009
to discuss certain,

23:35.555 --> 23:49.009
mostly, Something that might concern

23:50.491 --> 24:02.089
our relationship with the American system, the 
officers. Problems that have come up, we've got to

24:02.730 --> 24:08.218
stop doing this, we've got complaints, such and 
such. So there was a certain amount of structure

24:09.019 --> 24:13.967
which was passed on. from the Americans to us, and 
our, the guys that took, that were in command,

24:14.858 --> 24:26.253
these were mostly, mostly they were professional 
soldiers, career soldiers. They did it like a,

24:26.273 --> 24:32.161
like it was, like they were at home, you know. They 
told us, this is, this is, come to the area, we've

24:32.181 --> 24:39.972
got to stop doing this, and we've got to shape up a 
little, this is. So there was an interaction

24:40.947 --> 24:46.615
between the prisoner and the guards and the 
officers. And they, every day, had to have, that

24:47.175 --> 24:53.624
was something that they wanted us to do or change.

24:57.930 --> 25:01.275
So you knew you were constantly being watched and 
monitored. You felt, you know, that there was

25:01.835 --> 25:08.565
somebody counting and so forth. Who would you have 
taken orders from in the camp? Mostly from our own

25:11.862 --> 25:20.335
non-com, the oldest ranking non-com officers. 
They posted the times and the meetings.

25:28.607 --> 25:38.942
It was the same as a military operation, maybe not 
as strict and as rigid as it would in boot camp, but

25:28.607 --> 25:38.942
it kept always running. It was always run on the 
military. Were there fights or were there

25:42.490 --> 25:52.787
special problems? There were personality 
problems. gravitate toward the people that they

25:59.483 --> 26:28.697
liked and they formed little cliques and their 
properties into politics and things like that

25:59.483 --> 26:28.697
like you have in any fairly large group of people 
but all in all these were all non-com officers so

25:59.483 --> 26:28.697
they all kind of had a lot of personal pride in their 
rank and in their you know so it was very little did

25:59.483 --> 26:28.697
you usually uh So in one camp you were a draftsman, 
someplace else you worked outside picking fruit

26:29.167 --> 26:34.434
or picking things? No, I never had to go outside in 
the field and do any of that. I read about it, but I

26:39.500 --> 26:43.145
was not in that. No contract work for businesses or 
anything like that? No. Just that one possible

26:48.712 --> 26:54.600
orderly type job I had, and then the draftsman job. 
Then

26:56.774 --> 27:18.079
mostly my job would be to be there when this guy, the 
non-com officer in charge was in a meeting with the

26:56.774 --> 27:18.079
American officer. I would have to be there because 
it was always something they didn't understand.

27:26.103 --> 27:29.458
So I was engaged in that. Once we were dismissed 
from that, then I was on my own. I could do what I

27:34.802 --> 27:35.826
wanted to. That sounds like fun. It sounds a little 
boring. It was. It was boring and not very boring.

27:45.249 --> 27:47.792
We weren't talking about the honeymoon part. I 
heard you walk in on the word boring and I

27:47.832 --> 27:53.919
thought... Would you like a... Oh, that'd be 
great. Or if we have some more vodka. No, I've

27:56.001 --> 27:57.563
actually put the wine on this. Would you like a 
plane or something? I used to love planes.

28:02.809 --> 28:04.311
Schweppes and a Tequena. Yeah, that would be nice. 
That makes it kind of a spritzer, you know. It makes

28:09.597 --> 28:10.678
a spritzer. Yes, yes. I didn't have forgotten 
about that until this German college. You always

28:15.684 --> 28:20.670
had a spritzer.

28:22.292 --> 28:27.978
In taking on the name Wiles, it's the one letter 
that would be difficult to pronounce. Exactly.

28:29.654 --> 28:43.811
Part of it was emotional because this migrant 
laborer that took me along because, you know, as

28:29.654 --> 28:43.811
I've explained, it's easier to get jobs when you 
drive up to a farmer and say you have two hands. You

28:44.372 --> 28:53.603
can contract, for instance, pruning or in the 
wintertime you prune the plum orchards and get rid

28:44.372 --> 28:53.603
of all the external branches. One guy couldn't 
possibly prune Eight, ten acres. Two guys can get

28:58.498 --> 29:02.003
something done. And he had the car. And he looked 
like my brother. And

29:09.633 --> 29:15.381
he looked like my brother. He was the same type, 
really. And as I said, I always looked for

29:20.148 --> 29:26.577
similarities to make me feel at ease and at home. 
This morning, I saw this lady in the lobby, and I

29:27.029 --> 29:30.774
thought she looked like my sister. I do this all the 
time. It's similar. It's kind of a game I play. I

29:36.701 --> 29:38.063
entertain myself. And he was a real nice guy, 
low-key. He had been divorced, or his wife ran out

29:42.829 --> 29:52.982
on him, and took up with an officer while he was 
overseas. He was a discharge.

29:58.028 --> 29:59.930
And he would get on these crime jokes. He was still 
in love with his wife, so he would get very sad about

29:59.950 --> 30:05.174
that little break up. He would tell me about it. 
Then he'd go to the nearest bar and he'd drink up. I

30:08.957 --> 30:12.000
wouldn't see him, and he'd drink up everything 
we'd made. And I'd sit in the hotel room looking at

30:12.020 --> 30:16.804
the walls. And then we'd sometimes have lunch in 
the bar with a sandwich and a straight shot. In one

30:27.745 --> 30:33.795
of those honky tonk bars in the valley and all up and 
down. Honky tonk bar. The music playing, the

30:35.537 --> 30:38.963
western music playing in the jerk box.

30:42.428 --> 30:51.202
But I could never get any money ahead because he was 
the one that made the deal with the farmer and the

30:42.428 --> 30:51.202
farmer paid him. He drank it up. He drank it up and he 
only gave me rent. pocket money, say. How much

30:57.404 --> 30:59.468
would you make working on a farm? How much would you 
be going through? Well, we would probably

31:02.693 --> 31:10.525
average, the highest I ever made was $20 a day 
picking cherries.

31:13.750 --> 31:19.379
I would probably say we'd average $8 to $10 a day, 
maybe. Whatever chores we had to do. so it was about

31:24.007 --> 31:48.023
a dollar a dollar i guess my father big chair told me 
a story about picking cherries once in the old

31:24.007 --> 31:48.023
country and he said that the only stipulation to 
all the kids that they hired was they had to keep

31:24.007 --> 31:48.023
singing and as soon as they stopped singing the 
performance would come and find them because i

31:24.007 --> 31:48.023
mean they were eating the fruit so they had to keep 
singing it didn't matter what song just everybody

31:24.007 --> 31:48.023
has to sing the moment they heard somebody up there 
stop singing how he was eating. You could eat all

31:50.298 --> 31:56.465
they were delicious, those cherries, those 
peaches. But once I got a little money ahead, I

31:58.447 --> 32:08.798
split, socked it away, you know, a dollar here and a 
dollar there. But I felt now that I had, I knew this

32:08.818 --> 32:14.083
was a real American name. This Peter Peterson, was 
just not a person. I couldn't. Oh, the cork popped,

32:20.904 --> 32:22.365
honey. Sure. How about Candy got mad? I felt I 
wasn't in the mainstream. I was too European and

32:28.533 --> 32:38.686
too much like an immigrant kind of thing.

32:38.706 --> 32:42.010
And I thought, I'd never heard a name like that 
before. Dennis Wilds. And it was also a challenge,

32:44.045 --> 32:49.872
as you pointed out, that W is the hardest thing to 
learn. And I started, and I said, why don't I take

32:51.573 --> 32:58.641
that name that's going to make me learn that 
letter? Because I have to learn that letter. When

33:00.383 --> 33:06.190
they say my name, I have to get into it, really. It 
took the hardest way, the toughest choice, and

33:06.210 --> 33:12.617
left the easy one for later. Did you ever run across 
his records? Or did your names ever cross

33:16.697 --> 33:18.901
anywhere? Someone say, Dennis, well, I knew a guy 
who lived down in the valley with the same name. No,

33:23.449 --> 33:26.254
in fact, everybody says they had never heard that 
name before. Once or twice, maybe, someone says he

33:27.736 --> 33:30.180
did. And I look in the phone book. Do you want that? I 
like the one for cameos. Every

33:35.783 --> 33:42.012
time, almost every time somebody would say it, 
they never heard that name. Dispelling or

33:42.292 --> 33:44.495
anything. W-H-I-L-E-S. Where's that guy today, 
do you think? I have no idea. Probably still

33:48.982 --> 33:50.804
picking fruit. Although he was about 10 years 
older, so he'd be 70. 70 years old, so I don't think

33:56.773 --> 34:01.960
he'd be climbing any trees. Where was that that 
you... Did you spend that time with him? All up and

34:07.509 --> 34:13.756
down California, San Joaquin Valley, following 
the crew. One season? One season. What year

34:15.278 --> 34:21.305
was it, do you think? When

34:21.345 --> 34:28.193
you left Peter Peterson? Peter Peterson. It was 
Peter Peterson. Probably 48, 49.

34:41.841 --> 34:45.085
Did you really feel yourself as Peter Peterson? 
No. I never got really warmed up. That's just...

34:50.672 --> 34:53.897
They actually took that and they spotted it. It was 
a great idea because they immediately said, oh,

34:53.917 --> 34:59.684
you're Norwegian or something, see? But that, to 
me, then I had to really be Norwegian. And then I

35:04.495 --> 35:09.402
was, you see, actually in... Typecast is 
something that you had to be. Yeah, but I didn't

35:09.662 --> 35:13.648
know anything how to be it, you see. So it was two... 
Everybody made me immediately typecast me. Yes.

35:19.556 --> 35:27.387
Well, once I switched to Dennis Walsh, there 
was... That's such a neutral name, nobody even

35:19.556 --> 35:27.387
knows where it's from. Yes. But the... You needed 
Peter Peterson during the accent. Yes, that was

35:32.245 --> 35:34.008
ideal. Nobody questioned my accent. As a typical 
Peter Peterson guy. So once you felt more

35:39.378 --> 35:41.962
comfortable, that's when you changed. You must 
have felt that you could make it in English with no

35:42.664 --> 35:46.731
trouble, because it was time to learn. I was trying 
to improve, and that W thing, I felt that was a good

35:46.751 --> 35:52.862
idea. I didn't want to be a lumberjack Norwegian 
forever and ever, having had that accident

35:53.348 --> 36:03.820
already, cutting down my trees. And that close 
call of somebody wanting me to run a lumber mill for

36:03.880 --> 36:11.690
them. Yes, yes. What was that about? Yeah, there 
was a real weird, this Chinchilla Brothers had

36:13.251 --> 36:23.203
done some fruit packing for them outside of 
Stockton. And then I went off to the snow country

36:24.567 --> 36:32.860
again, and when I came back, my red-headed 
landlady said, you know, they've been looking for

36:24.567 --> 36:32.860
you. They had a chance to buy a lumber mill and they 
wanted you to run it. I was typecast as a

36:40.032 --> 36:46.542
knowledgeable lumberjack, I guess. Which I was 
not, so... Did you ever have to go up and top trees

36:47.737 --> 36:57.371
and... Yeah, in that one time I went to Medford to 
pick apples and they weren't ready. And being that

36:57.952 --> 37:02.398
I was Peter Peters and they thought, why don't you 
go out and cut some trees down for us and make some

36:57.952 --> 37:02.398
logs. Hmm. Terrible mosquitoes and... Yeah, I 
don't recall the mosquitoes. But this was with

37:09.729 --> 37:10.690
the... With the prongs in your feet and spikes? No, 
I didn't have to climb up. They were fairly small

37:15.434 --> 37:17.057
trees. I could cut them from the base, from the 
bottom. This is before chainsaws. Yeah, before

37:23.287 --> 37:24.188
chainsaws. Just big, big sharp legs. But, you 
know, I wouldn't know how to sharpen in eggs and

37:27.394 --> 37:31.600
things like that. And pretty soon I would be... 
Also, Peter Peterson was good while it lasted.

37:37.418 --> 37:38.339
While it lasted, yeah. And then when your English 
became better, then you risked another jump to

37:38.359 --> 37:44.064
then as well. How did you come up with the, how did 
you build a past? A past? Yeah, how did you build,

37:49.529 --> 37:52.692
how did you sit down and say, well, Connecticut 
School of the Boys.

37:55.774 --> 38:04.302
I went to the library in Stockton and studied the 
Northeast. little towns around Lake Placid.

38:11.486 --> 38:20.678
And the schools, looked up some schools that I 
could, might have gone to that looked

38:11.486 --> 38:20.678
interesting. And I found that school for boys. 
That might explain a few things. It was different

38:27.748 --> 38:28.669
enough It was not a regular school because I just 
never understood the school system, the public

38:29.155 --> 38:36.105
school system. I could never remember the grades. 
Do they start at eight or go down? Do they start at

38:40.271 --> 38:42.914
one and go up? So this way, you went all schooling in 
one place. Yeah. It simplifies it. And then an

38:49.704 --> 38:51.366
orphan, you know. And in a school for boys, that 
indicates I was probably Catholic. That's true,

38:55.341 --> 38:57.505
yes. Did you go to church while you were on the, 
while you were out, after you left the camp? No, but

39:04.376 --> 39:07.301
I went to church while I was in camp. On Sundays, 
yes. We went to church. But once you left camp, I'm

39:13.098 --> 39:15.942
trying to think what churches I went to. Yes, I did 
go to some of the churches. I went to some of them.

39:20.089 --> 39:22.072
But I didn't know what church I was in. There were so 
many different religions. Baptists, you know.

39:25.537 --> 39:26.939
People would ask me to go along. But a Catholic 
church, no? No, never went to a Catholic. So you

39:30.384 --> 39:32.087
never went to confession? No. Mostly Baptist 
type. The kind that we didn't have in Germany. If

39:35.993 --> 39:39.258
you had gone to confession, would you have said, 
I'm going to escape? Even in a confessional. It

39:41.735 --> 39:47.583
wouldn't have said I'm a prisoner, fugitive.

39:48.525 --> 39:52.791
You don't take religion that seriously.

39:53.432 --> 39:57.338
That's good.

39:57.498 --> 39:58.740
That was a personal thing. This whole thing is very 
personal. I didn't want to involve anybody. I

40:03.166 --> 40:08.474
didn't want to ask for any help from anybody or put 
them into jeopardy. And don't put myself into

40:09.035 --> 40:11.438
jeopardy. Yeah,

40:11.688 --> 40:28.566
it

40:11.688 --> 40:28.566
took a long time to get over some of that, you know, 
that really independence of not taking anybody

40:30.250 --> 40:37.257
and then not letting anybody get close. But I 
finally realized you have to get close to someone,

40:37.277 --> 40:43.824
especially the opposite sex. It just is not 
natural to do that kind of thing. And I could see

40:48.809 --> 40:57.658
these loners, these lone fruit pickers, these old 
men, I could see their fate, what happens to them.

40:57.807 --> 40:58.688
You know, they're Schicksal. They're Schicksal. 
And the drinking that they do, the solitary

41:00.751 --> 41:13.327
drinking, the sadness that they talk about their 
whatever short marriage they had. I was married

41:13.868 --> 41:19.495
for five years and not alone. And that was it. It was 
the highlight of their life. And then it was more or

41:22.399 --> 41:26.464
less downhill.

41:28.992 --> 41:31.655
on an emotional basis for them. They kept on 
working and living, but... Inside they were dead.

41:37.723 --> 41:40.406
They were dead. And I kept reading, you know. I 
never stopped reading. I'm constantly first to

41:43.751 --> 41:48.236
how to do books. And especially, you know, these 
books that relate to to get yourself upright, to

41:54.102 --> 42:01.851
get yourself squared away psychologically. 
Unfortunately, a lot of Americans are into that.

42:05.615 --> 42:07.457
Unfortunately, they're into that. So there are 
plenty of books available on that subject. And

42:11.722 --> 42:16.708
just keep reading and reading and finding 
similarities. Look for something that I can

42:16.728 --> 42:19.992
apply. to get myself straightened out so that I 
don't go off to deep end, I don't start drinking, or

42:20.208 --> 42:36.985
I don't get frustrated and violent and whatever.

42:38.366 --> 42:40.068
And all these books help me. The Power of Positive 
Thinking and The Art of Conversation and all that.

42:46.775 --> 42:48.797
And you would just carry that book with you? Yeah, I 
had him, still had him when I got married. I just

42:51.704 --> 42:56.369
opened the library, but I couldn't get anybody 
interested in it, in the family. I wanted my kids, I

42:56.389 --> 43:02.455
wanted Cheryl and Mark to read it, but they were 
just not into it. They didn't need to get into the

43:02.475 --> 43:06.359
mainstream as badly as you. Let me ask you this. 
What did you think might happen to you if something

43:07.099 --> 43:11.163
did go wrong? Let's say that you were, the worst 
came to worst, and the feds somehow found you? What

43:20.994 --> 43:23.537
was the worst thing that happened? I'm trying to 
imagine what the fear is. The fear is just someone

43:26.700 --> 43:28.622
getting you. Or the fear is, or did you think 
farther and say, well, if they get me, they're

43:29.603 --> 43:35.249
going to put me in jail. I don't want to be in a small 
room with bars on it. But that will only be

43:39.033 --> 43:41.936
temporary because eventually they'll take me in 
front of a judge. They'll give me some sort of

43:41.956 --> 43:45.699
punishment. I'll probably be sent back to Europe. 
Maybe. All right, so I'll be in Europe. Well, I'd

43:52.279 --> 43:55.964
certainly want to go back to Europe. It's almost 
the same as a prison. I see. The way I look at Europe.

44:00.892 --> 44:01.913
I see. To me, it's just a small little place on the 
map, not any larger than California.

44:10.527 --> 44:10.967
Right. So there's a fear of every one of those 
things, being captured, jail, the trial, and the

44:18.012 --> 44:22.256
shipment back. So there isn't any good thing in 
there. I see what you're saying. I see no good thing

44:24.198 --> 44:25.440
at all. The humiliation of one day here you're a 
free man, you walk the streets as a free man, and the

44:25.460 --> 44:41.896
next day

44:25.460 --> 44:41.896
you're a criminal. So I couldn't see anything good 
about it. It came to my mind many times. To just walk

44:49.438 --> 44:52.541
into the nearest FBI office and say, here I am. No. 
No. If somebody caught me. Yes. I wasn't thinking

44:57.447 --> 44:58.808
of doing it. Oh, I see. Voluntarily to do that. 
Well, that's what I was wondering. What would

45:04.754 --> 45:05.435
happen? What did you think would happen if you did 
walk in? All right, they would take me, they would

45:10.000 --> 45:13.163
arrest me, they would hit me, they would beat me. 
Ultimately, the worst thing they could do is they

45:13.885 --> 45:18.811
should be back here. Yeah. That's the worst. Yeah. 
Well, I mean, that sounds fair to me. I'm just

45:23.576 --> 45:26.460
saying what part of it was the most frightening. 
OK. And OK, then you have to remember, every day I

45:26.660 --> 45:34.249
have a good day here. I have friends. I have jobs. Of 
course, sometimes I don't. But 90% of the time. So

45:43.585 --> 45:47.129
that means all the good things are going to stop. It 
isn't as if I have so much to give up. And then have to

45:52.295 --> 45:57.401
take something that is inferior. Right. I was just 
wondering whether you saw it as something

46:00.345 --> 46:05.050
permanent or temporary. Because you could go to 
Europe and earn money there and then come back as

46:05.110 --> 46:09.255
a...
